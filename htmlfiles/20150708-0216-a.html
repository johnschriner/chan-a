EA a best.</br>    <br>He was chased because he could cure the plague and which goes against MT plans to destroy humanity.

It's one-sided by Keith. <br>But it does have Grisha telling Keith that Eren is not his son.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127723936 <br>Betaville population: Keith and Jean</br>  Is Grisha from BRA village? That'd make some interesting conflicts with Eren since he wants to kill them so bad.  <br>Were is translator kun</br>  <br>It would explain why he's an MT like shifter, now that we know that MT is from the warrior village.</br>  <br>Because Isayama is unoriginal and a bad writer. Expect more kidnapping this arc.</br>  <br>You forgot Bort, Reiner and Mikucksa.</br>  <br>You forgot Nigmir</br>  <br>Alphaville population: Grisha and MT.</br>  <br>No. Grisha was the one saying "He's my son, not yours".</br>   ITT: People misusing the word cuck   <br>It's just you guys assuming any character interacting with another character means romance is happening so you see it everywhere.</br>  <br>Tha't's what I just said</br>  <br>Grisha cuck Keith</br>  <br>Hello newfag.</br>  <br>I think he is and ran away from MT, since he shared technology and information favoring the humans and the cure to counter the titan serum.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127724108 <br>Jean is a beta cuck and will die along with Sasha and Connie.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127724108 <br>Jean is one of the biggest beta in snk and also the first cuck.</br>  <br>Ymir's not beta</br>  Cuckold commanded titans to kill Carla, because he was forever mad at her.  <br>Sure, that's why this is playing out exactly like it's a stupid romance drama.

Don't you have to pleasure some monkey genitals somewhere?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127724146 <br>MT is going the cuck historia by killing Ymir in front of her</br>  <br>Your formulation<br>  Grisha telling Keith that Eren is not his son. <br>was ambiguous</br></br></br>  Grisha is best boy  Another month of waiting for nothing. Thanks Isayama, Shingeki no Cuck is awesome.  <br> wants to kill them so bad <br> what is reading comprehension </br></br>  <br>Grisha kills children and drugs his own son.</br>  <br>Look how sad historia is when she realise that Eren is going to kill everyone in her harem</br>  <br> he's an MT like shifter <br><br>Mt is hairy, is way way bigger and has monkey arms.<br>how is him anything like MT?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Same shit.</br>  Why is Keith even telling him this stuff? This information doesn't appear to have relevance to what Eren is looking for  <br>Rick and Shane reference?</br>  <br> Mikucksa <br> Cuckeith <br> Cuckyrmin <br> Cuckannie <br> Cuckenny <br><br>I think Isayama might be a /tv/ poster</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm wondering the same. What's the point of this?</br>  <br>More content --&gt; more money for Isayama --&gt; more instant ramen for his tummy.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127724392 <br>Fine he can have Mikasa</br>  <br>Isayama likes to stall. And Keith probably doesn't know much about the topic in the first place.<br><br>Also, I think Grisha being from outside of the wall is pretty damn relevant.</br></br></br>  <br>Eren asked him to tell him everything he knows after Keith told him that he looked like his mother but had his father's eyes.</br>  Grisha's saying that Eren is different from Keith because he is Grisha's son, therefore Eren is special.  <br>We Harry Potter now? It mentions a chosen one in the spoilers.</br>  <br>Does Levi kill Dumbledore?</br>  <br>Eren is the son of a shifter or whatever Grisha is, of course he's going to be different.</br>  <br>Sure, Grisha being from the outside makes sense, but that could have been inferred from everything we knows so far, so no need to spend this much panel time on Shadis/Carla/Grisha stuff for one measly piece of info we already strongly suspected.</br>  <br>I think it's more likely that Grisha was some sort of leader and Eren is his only heir.</br>   Inb4 Grisha is royalty from outside the Walls.   <br>Stalling. Remember when we all thought Historia would give answers about the wall titans and all we got was a sad backstory.</br>  <br>Wall Titans seem to be forgotten in general.</br>  This chapter looks well drawed for once.  <br>True, the way Nick worded stuff, it sounded like Historia actually knew shit but I guess not. (Maybe that was a retcon to drag out the series.)</br>  <br>We did get some sort of answers on them though.</br>  <br>Is that Carla sitting next to Grisha? Did they just get married?</br>  <br>Grisha is a faggot with his special snowflake son.</br>  <br> This information doesn't appear to have relevance to what Eren is looking for <br>Eren told Grisha and Keith that Carla has been eaten. After exchanging a few words with Grisha, sad Keith leaves the scene. Then he heard the titan transformation (but doesn't know what it was). He comes back and find Eren, and takes him back to a shelter.</br></br>  <br>But I mean no one seems to be concerned of them currently. And now are they going to learn more about them now? Or was that little moment all Isayama is going to say until they wake up?</br>  <br>Seems like it. Probably a typical wedding for middle class peopl who live within the walls.</br>  <br>I'm just so fucking glad they're back.</br>  あだなは「ベルトル」<br>by諫山先生<br><br>ワロタ<br><br>Apparently Isayama gave Bert a nickname. I think it was for the Giants game, but it could be for the Bessatsu. There's a special feature in it this time where fans were able to submit nicknames for everyone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So basically Isayama wasted a chapter on a irrelevant flashback <br>Why am I not surprised</br></br>  <br> well-drawn </br>  <br>What's everyone else's nickname?</br>  <br>He's trying to drag out the story.</br>  <br> we could have had the start of the next expedition in this chapter <br><br>Feels bad, man.</br></br></br>    <br>Why can't isayama draw babies? He just looks like a fat manlet.</br>  So this could have been a chapter where we could potentially have gotten answers, but instead Isayama just drags the story out with a retarded Keith-Grisha-Carla love triangle and no answers.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127724207 <br>Kek alpha beta shit doesn't apply to women, neckbeard.<br>It's just men that misbehave like dogs.</br></br>  <br>Pointy ears, buff build, beard, badass overall look, even the human forms look similar.</br>  <br>Heh.<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127723694 <br> &gt;When was Grisha revealed as a Reiss? <br> THIS chapter <br><br>No.<br><br><br>Ymir-sama</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  To be fair this is not the whole chapter is it? Where is the rest. Has anyone read it so far?  <br>Unless they can read moon, probably not.</br>  <br>They only wanted to know the wall secrets so they can seal it the hole for now. They'll probably wake up later.</br>  <br>Flashback is around 20 pages.</br>  <br>And the rest is?</br>  <br>I hope it's not. I still need to see MEN</br>  <br>Talking between HLEMSAJK</br>  Center Field - Eren<br>Shortstop - Connie<br>Third Base - Reiner<br>Designated Hitter - Levi<br>Right Field - Jean<br>First Base - Bertholt<br>Catcher - Ymir<br>Second Base - Sasha<br>Left Field - Annie<br>Pitcher - Mikasa<br><br> Designated Hitter <br> Hitler </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's most of it. There's a little HEL but that's it.</br>  <br>Wasn't this old news? Bertl has been around for a while.<br><br><br>He's done it before.</br></br></br></br>  So could next chapter be about Erwin plan for the next expedition and then chapter 73 will be about everyone interacting with each before they leave.<br>Then chapter 74 the expedition starts</br>  <br>I think Isayama just brought up the nickname Bertl again. Bert's full first name is ベルトルト. There's not any mention of anyone else.</br>  <br>interview where he said they were friends.</br>  <br> Marlo? </br>  <br> Ymir is Grisha's illegitimate child  <br> Ymir is Eren's sister </br></br>  <br>H=Hanji<br>L=Levi<br>E=Erwin<br>M=Mikasa<br>S=Sasha<br>A=Armin<br>J=Jean(?)<br>K=Keith</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes but since this isn't a romance manga, and ANnie has been stuck in a rock since 33, it more likely that the relationship will never develop.</br>  <br>Dude, isn't Ymir like way too old to be Grisha's child</br>  <br>That's optimistic. They probably won't leave within this year</br>  <br>Isayama just brought it up again. It's the first time he's brought up himself.</br>  <br>It could be just more flashbacks and Eren getting kidnapped by angry wall people again.</br>  <br>Considering the pacing of this series I wouldn't be surprised.</br>  <br>E = Eren<br>J = Jean<br>Everything else is right.</br></br></br>  Where the fuck are translators? Are they sleeping or something?  I need to know whether cuckodry is real in this chapter.   <br>Nah</br>  <br>gtfo and see ya next month</br>  <br>On a related note, you can hear the seiyuus in character cheering up the players on a baseball game here:<br>https://twitter.com/afuafuafu/statu<wbr>s/618382711091138560</wbr></br></br>  Why do all the shingekis look like their moms?  <br>Would you rather that they look like their dads?</br>  <br>Only Erwin looks like his dad.</br>  <br>Why Eren's mother here looks like Historia?<br><br> Eren has mother complex. EH confirmed. </br></br></br>  <br>It's baseball season huh</br>  <br>Historia looks more like her dad</br>  <br>What are they talking about?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127725027 <br>It would be cool if some characters end up separated from the rest and we follow different groups. I assumed we will start with Levi squad 2 together since Levi picked them for the purpose of making Eren desperate.</br>   Are you going to commit yourself to that child? <br>Keith is MAD that Carla had a son with Grisha</br>  <br>Levi wanting to make Eren desperate never made sense to me. <br>Eren's shown to be a competent soldier who follows orders. Why would Levi want Eren to lose his shit and potentially fuck things up?</br></br>  <br>Maybe he also fears that Grisha will return to his true home beyond the walls one day.</br>  <br> GIANTS </br>  <br>There's no mention of them in the spoilers. I thought it was obvious by now that Mike wasn't Erwin and Nile's friend?</br>  <br>If Eren is Keith's son, Grisha's the cuck.</br>  <br>Because last time Eren saw someone he cared about die and then was in mortal danger with Mikasa, he awakened the coordinate power and even controlled it briefly.<br><br>Levi probably hopes that this will happen again if Eren sees one of his friends in danger.</br></br></br>  <br> Eren: Why were you in my father's flashback and memories? <br> Keith: It was over 20 years ago when I first saw your mother, Carla.... <br> Eren: I'm asking about my dad! <br> Keith: God, was I madly in love. <br><br>Is he senile?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think that was a plot device Isayama ended up dropping. JSC mutiny bowl was enough.</br>  <br>Because it makes manlet look too bad?</br>   Still waiting for translation   <br>Don't blame Keith for Isayama's shit storytelling skills.</br>  <br>Is Keith the Snape of SnK?</br>  <br> mutinybowl <br>Good times.</br></br>  I like that we get more background on Grisha and Keith but it sucks that it's for a love triangle thing.  Did Keith know that Eren ate his father or not? He should have seen Grisha's corpse right?  <br>If you mean that little blip in his blog then all he said was that Eren didn't have romantic feelings. In the same way that Marlo cares about Hitch. Or Mikasa's relationship with Jean. Like pretty much all romances being one sided. So caring seriously about shipping is pointless in this series</br>  <br>Yeah, the triangle seems like unnecessary repetition. We get it, SL men are always cucks against non-SL men.</br>  WTF, where are the spoilers? Can anyone tell me?  <br>A lot of people died and the only thing left of Grisha were his lower half.</br>  Keith was actually mad for not getting Grisha.  <br>Annie is the best</br>  <br>Mangakansou. Also this thread.</br>  Keith messed with Eren';s belt to confirm that he was a special snowflake.  Keith looked really old in the flashback, and Carla looked really young. How old was he when he fucked her?  <br>Everywhere, just no translators around.</br>  <br><br>Thanks, I owe you one</br></br>  <br>He never did, he is beta as fuck</br>  <br>If he didn't dick her then Grisha wouldn't need to reiterate to him that he's his son, not Keith's.</br>  <br>Grisha was saying that Eren is special because he's his son.</br>  Why are the parents in SnK so shitty?  <br>Grisha probably knew Keith was in love with Carla and he didn't like him getting close to his family.</br>  <br>Because MUH DRAMA.</br>  in snk all characters look exactly like their mothers. except for Erwin  <br>they lived in a shitty world</br>  <br>They are the catalysts for everything that goes wrong it seems.</br>  <br>Kenny wasn't shitty at all but he wasn't really a parent, just a crazy uncle.</br>  <br>Neither do Historia and Jean.</br>  <br>Didn't look to me like Keith held any ill feelings towards Grisha despite getting cucked by him.</br>  <br>Or maybe Nick thought the whole royal family inherited the ancient knowledge genetically.</br>  <br>Erwin's dad was okay, and maybe Annie's.</br>  <br>Jean's mom probably spoils him rotten considering how Jean treats her like shit.</br>  <br>Or Isayama fucked up.</br>  <br>Mikasa's parents, Armin's parents, Connie's parents, Sasha's dad and Jean's mum were all fine though.</br>  <br>Given how things happened, I assume he meant she could make the decision to have the information about the titans be made public.</br>  Reiss and Jeager looks too much alike to be a coincidence.  <br>or he know that if historia ate the corridnate she would get all the information</br>  <br>Manlet's mom<br>Erwin's dad<br>Eren's mom</br></br></br>  <br>jean mom doesn't exist.</br>  <br>Or maybe this was before Isayama expanded the story.</br>  <br> Armin's parents <br>We never saw Armin's parents.</br></br>  <br>Anon mikasa parent were terrible <br>They made her live a life without mikasa realising the danger inside the wall.<br>And because of that Mikasa almost became a slave for those criminal</br></br></br>  <br>What's so bad about not telling a child that the world is actually a shitty place</br>  Chinkfag here, got the chapter, but my scanner is on fire, can you wait until next month?  <br>I just noticed Levi didn't eat anything.</br>  Scanner here, Chinkfag is on fire.  <br>ebin</br>  <br>first chapter in a new volume, start of a new arc, come one anon, it was bound to happen.</br>  <br>How?

This is my child. Please, stop meddling in our affairs.”<br>After Shadis came to check, he found Eren collapsing on the ground<br>He thought of what Carla said back in the days :” it doesn’t matter that he’s not the greatest nor the most docile, but please look at this baby, he is so cute. He is already very great for surviving in such world.”<br>Keith was the one who broke Eren’s belt</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But if Carla is a Reiss, why was she working as a barmaid?</br>  <br>Eren looks like Frieda. Then again Eren looks exactly like his mother.</br>  <br>And Frieda has the same exact face as Historia just dark hair and taller.</br>  <br>I was about to say that, same dark hair.</br>  TRANSLATION WHEN  <br>If you did this translation yourself, thank you.</br>  <br>So basically Grisha cuck shadis <br><br>Grisha could be also from the outside village</br></br></br>  <br> Shadis refused Erwin’s long formation enemy detection formation plan and told him to try later when he would become the commander <br>Based Isayama shitting on ACWNR</br></br>  <br>Did Grisha get his memories erased or was he being dodgy?</br>  <br>I don't see it. They have, different noses, different eyes and different hair.</br>  <br>he has a mom, but we don't know if she is exactly like the lady in the ova.</br>  <br>Oh also, Hanji got mad at Shadis for holding such important info for so long. Levi cut her off bc he understood Shadi's feels.</br>  <br><br>Why did Grisha have amnesia? (Coordinate power memory wipe?)</br></br>  <br> Levi cut her off bc he understood Shadi's feels. <br>Levi confirmed cuck?</br></br>  <br> Grisha didn’t remember anything except his name and his occupation as a doctor <br>I guess he was pretending.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Then probably Carla not a reiss if she's a bar maid <br>Since humanity population is low it could be common for people to have similar genes</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>True, but the OVA design was based on the joke page Isayama did, and I don't see any reason why he should make her look different if she is ever shown in the main story.</br>  <br>Probably</br>  <br>i guess that possible. Easier for him too used an old template.</br>  <br>I wonder about that too. But then again ACWNR happened a year before walls breach and he was already a squad leader then. Maybe Shadis became more lenient 15 years after cucking? <br><br><br><br><br>From what I see it sounds like he got his memory erased. I remember spoilers somewhere saying memories are fuzzy can be manipulated rather easily.<br>Strange that he asked about the wall city though.<br><br><br>Didn't one spoiler said Carla got kicked out of her family for whatever reason?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Where is the rest ?  <br>No apparently some spoilers were fake<br>Such Carla being a reiss</br></br>  <br>She doesn't have the sparse Carla/Eren brows either.</br>  Cuck: the arc  <br>Didn't Eren say that Grisha started to act strange ever since Carla died?<br>Maybe the shock and trauma jogged Grisha's memory and made him remember that he is a shifter etc.</br></br>  <br>The Grisha being a Reiss was fake. And Carla probably isn't a Reiss either.</br>  <br> Carla thought everyone from the SL are special <br>I wonder why she didn't want Eren to join so bad then.</br></br>  <br>Or she is a Reiss and was abandoned.</br>  <br>I doubt he got his memories erased. I'm 100% sure he was lying, obviously he couldn't tell that he was a wall foreigner and that there exists another civilization outside of MRS.</br>  If Eren was a Reiss then why would Isayama draw Historia and Eren's eyes together as comparisons? He was obviously trying to show how their eye details differ.  <br>Not everyone is a Reiss anon. And as  said, small population can cause people to have a similar apparence. That or the author's same face.</br>  <br>Considering how they let Historia become an SL it wouldn't be surprising if Reiss let their bastard kids run around to become hookers.</br>  <br><br>It's better if Historia be the last reiss this is so her children don't inherit the first king will</br></br>  <br>Maybe he was subtly trying to hint that they actually do look similar.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>They let her become SL because they originally didn't need her but Rod also didn't want to kill her, either.</br>  <br>Pic related.<br><br>The first king will is only passed through coordinates.</br></br></br>   1 more day till digital copy of Bessatu <br> must. not. read. spoilers. </br>  <br>Based.</br>  <br>Could be a red herring, or even a double red herring. People thought that JSCMH couldn't be titans since that joke page but then that chapter where Historia almost became one happened.</br>  <br>Are you implying that tumblrfujo delusion of Levi being afraid to be left by Erwin is real?</br>  <br>That wasn't being a spoiler.That was an anon joking around but ended up being right with the triangle and Keith getting cucked.</br>  <br>They don't. Eren has more oval eyes and Historia are like tsurime shape.</br>  mrs were sisters with different mind based powers<br>the first one started the reiss bloodline with memory powers<br>the second one started carlas bloodline with the power to control titans and humans<br>the third ones unknown<br>the coordinate makes their powers stronger</br></br></br></br>  <br>And now we have the syringe plot.</br>  If the Yeager last name was so special then how come BRA didn't recognized it?  <br>One poem for the cuck, pls?</br>  <br>He does have attachment issues, yes.</br>  <br> the triangle and Keith getting cucked <br>That was a combination of dreamfag and fujo's spoiler though?</br></br>  <br>That pic just shows their only similarity is they have big irises. So does Erwin.</br>  <br> Grisha didn’t remember anything except his name and his occupation as a doctor and asked Shadis about inside the walls <br><br>Guess this confirms Jaeger isn't a special snowflake bloodline.</br></br></br>  <br>;_;7</br>  <br>People in SnK are dumb when it comes to recognizing names. SL didn't recognize Ymir's name until Hanji heard about it.<br>Or Isayama is just a shitty writer.</br></br>  <br>Cause Grisha and BRA aren't affiliated also  Ymir Yeager </br>  <br>Or, you know, it was a joke about the fact that we only just learned Ymir's name ourselves.</br>  <br>And jew-kun too.</br>  <br>Grisha only remembered his first name. Keith gave him a last name.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br><br>That's just as dumb, why wouldn't Ymir recognize her own last name? This is just dumb. Or Yeager is not that special.</br></br>  <br>I wish her name wasn't spoiled so early everywhere. It's probably gonna lose impact when S2 rolls around.</br>  <br> Keith gave him a last name <br>Really?</br></br>  <br>Which the Fujo partially got from here.</br>  <br>acnwr isn't canon</br>  <br>Fuck that asspull BA crush for fueling shipper delusions everytime two characters stare at each other in the series.</br>  <br>Sauce?</br>    <br>When I started reading the manga after watching the anime one of the things that clued me into BR being titans was that Bert kept staring at Annie. <br>Never imagined it'd turn into a shipping thing though.</br></br>  <br>The spoilers that were just posted</br>  <br>Levi keeps staring at Mikasa and we all know what route Isayama is heading to.</br>  <br><br>そうして被害者がいるわけでもなしに というハンネスの言葉からそこは上への報告はなし という事で収めてしまう二人<br><br>やがてグリシャをつれて外へと出たキースは ここからどこに帰るつもりだ”グリシャ・イェーガー”と話しかける<br><br>シャーディス「ーこれからは出生記録にも無い名前を名乗るんだろ？」<br><br>が 名前以外にも自分が医者だということは覚えているというグリシャは 出来る仕事があるはずだと病院を紹介してくれという</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well in BA's case he did stare after here when she didn't join the SL.In hindsight it was obvious he liked her.</br>  <br>I still have trouble believing that that one look towards Annie was one of love when she left for the MP and Bort stayed in the SL. Seemed more like he was scared that he had to deal with Reiner and his delusions alone now.</br>  <br>More family drama.</br>  STILL who knows the rest of the chapter?  Just checking, does status anon want me to do the chart again this month or do you want to do it?  <br>No one thought that Bert's stare was because he liked her either before that chapter came out except for one guy.</br>  <br> Grisha didn’t remember anything except his name <br>So, Grisha Jaegar. He remembered the last name.</br></br>  <br>So Yaeger isn't Eren's real last name. Could it be possible that Grisha had no last name?</br>  <br>Historia stared at Eren when he was looking at his key and look what happened. So the formula BA follows confirms LM and EH too.</br>  <br>Of course. The master cuck just can't keep his fantasies out of his manga.</br>  <br>This is the biggest plot hole all versions of ACWNR have so far. <br>Second one being Levi's origin where the manga hinted that Levi might not come from the underground.<br>I think it really depends on when exactly Shadis denied Erwin's plans. Would make sense if Shadis went back to his words a decade later but it would be otherwise a definitive continuation flaw.<br>For a spinoff to have 3 forms of adaptation you'd think they would be more careful with things like this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've rather seen people use it more to prove he was working alongside her.</br>  <br>Go for it. I've been so busy lately that I can only lurk the threads once in a while in my phone.<br> But wait for CR first. </br></br>  Karla is the best girl.  <br> In hindsight it was obvious he liked her. <br>No it wasn't.</br></br>  Grisha only knew his first name because he had no last name.  <br> one </br>  <br>He obviously had one. Perhaps it's the same of  MT and Ymir. </br>  <br>YOU 100 % percent you. 7th status kun is the best.</br>  <br>No. He said he only remember his fullname and job.</br>  <br>Alright, thank you.<br> I'll wait for CR. I do like chink scans better but the official translations are worth the wait. </br></br>  <br>Meant to quote . He didn't stare only once at her. Though it could be interpreted that he was staring at Reiner instead.</br>  <br>Didn't Keith give him the Jaeger last name though.</br>  <br>What's the constant OOOOOOO supposed to be?</br>   Forget everything <br>Right, that's why he kept a basement full of research and knew how to cure a illness easily, because he forgot everything.</br>  <br>The wind.</br>  <br>Bert just picked to go to SL after saying that he'd abandon everything if he didn't go to MP only 3 chapters ago. And he was revealed to be working with her in destroying the wall. That stare could've meant a lot of things other than romance. Bert didn't even show any sign of romantic attractions to her before that either. Even small things like blushing at her or something.</br>  <br>It said he didn't forget his occupation as a doctor. That entails all the knowledge of the science and biology it comes with.</br>  <br>We will probably get more explanation behind it when we get more insight on BRA.</br>  <br>And? People knew the look was important, everyone pointed it out long before Isayama revealed the reason for it. This isn't the same as people picking out any random look in someones direction, because Bert's look was emphasized and clearly meant to mean something. You act as if the excuses people were coming up for it were even plausible, like the idea that he was looking at her because Reiner is so crazy and spontaneously decided to join the legion.</br>   Still no translation   <br>Eren's being so nice there, it breaks my heart.</br>  <br>Wouldn't it give away too much if he was blushing at the Female Titan before the CT/AT reveal? I mean it would give away the whole reveal, Isayama was as subtle as he should with the BA thing.<br><br>I think he chose to stay in the SL at the last moment to support Reiner with his delusions. There's no other reason to stay back in the SL if Reiner was covering that position.</br></br></br>  <br>We should just consider it fan fiction because it has so many flaws. Plus how could levi become humanity strongest in less then a year? And if ACWNR was canon then no way Shadis diss Erwin for his titan formation plan.</br>   が 名前以外にも自分が医者だということは覚えているというグリシャは 出来る仕事があるはずだと病院を紹介してくれという <br><br>All Grisha remembered was that he was a doctor and that his name was Grisha. Someone clearly brainwashed him and made him forget everything except these two things.</br></br>  <br>That's because Eren is a nice person generally, this isn't surprising at all.</br>  <br>I really like Bert in this page, too bad it happened too early in the anime and no one paid attention to it. In retrospect it really helps understand his character.</br>  <br>Why would a simple crush/blush give away CT/AT reveal? Reiner has unabashedly blushed at Historia before and thought he wanted to marry her.</br>  <br>The original plan was probably for all of them to join the MP, so they could get close to the King.</br>  <br>Why would animefags care about it if they don't know he's the CT?</br>  <br>Yeah but Historia wasn't the female titan.</br>  <br>Wow historia looks more beautiful then she looks now</br>  <br>Bert could have liked Annie without knowing she was the FT.</br>  <br>So Keith really was the one who gave him the name Yaeger. That, or it was Carla's last name.</br>  <br>I mean that it happened in episode 2 or 3 and no one cared enough to memorize side characters so early on.</br>  <br>Reiner was delusional, Bert wasn't.</br>  <br> Plus how could levi become humanity strongest in less then a year <br>Ackerman shit <br> And if ACWNR was canon then no way Shadis diss Erwin for his titan formation plan. <br>There might be a time lapse of over a decade.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Krista &gt; Historia</br>  so, I probably stopped reading this series around when Historia was discovered to be next in the bloodline for the king (probably in the mid 50s chapter) and I dropped it because I felt like it was becoming more of a conspiracy plot and moving away from the titans. Does it pick back up?  <br>Eren could've have a crush on Annie and it wouldn't reveal her being the FT. Face it, BA is an asspull. It's cute, but still an asspull.</br>  <br>I like how Reiner and Bert have crushes on the two shortest characters.</br>  <br>It was Keith<br>He was probably trying to cover up the fact that Grisha was shady as fuck</br></br>  <br> Young Hannesu-san <br>My dick is diamonds</br></br>  <br>It would still be really suspicious because Annie was a spy and we already knew there were more spies. Naturally one would think that the guy that blushed at her is another spy. Hell, even the stares gave away much, a guy predicted it all way before the reveal.</br>  <br>The political across just finished and now they starting to get ready for wall maria</br>  <br>I don't think it's an asspull. We're talking about side characters with barely any prior screentime here, expect to see stuff you didn't know as they get more fleshed out.</br>  <br>You tell me</br>  <br>There were titans last chapter but probably not going be anymore for a while.</br>  <br>I like that Isayama laid down enough forshadowing that people could guess all that</br>  <br>Getting ready means at least 4 more chapter of preparation.</br>  If Grisha didn't remember anything then how did he know all that shit about the Reiss, like their secret cave? or about his own shifter powers?  <br>You think it was MT  his brother  who did it?</br>  Anon-san being Grisha's brother is confirmed then?  <br>If I remember correctly he said he was done with foreshadowing after ch50.</br>  <br>Maybe he regained some of his memories.</br>  <br>Better be a time lapse. Plus if i recalled correctly the underground wasn't flesh out until chapter 51 in the main manga.</br>  <br>Not any more confirmed than a month ago since anyone could have mindwipe powers for all we know. Also MT doesn't necessarily have to be Grisha's brother to need/want to mindwipe him for some reason.</br>    <br>No now is the time for answer to be revealed. I still see foreshadowing as of right now. Just not as much.</br>  <br>He looks similar enough</br>  <br>How does bert still have gas? Unless the homeland figure out how to refill the tanks?</br>  <br>It's still an asspull since it came out of nowhere. Petra, Reiner, Ymir, and a lot of characters had minimal screentime and even though it went nowhere/they died you could still easily interpret when they had a crush on someone.</br>  <br>Probably from a station in Shiganshina. There's plenty to go around.</br>    <br>MT took Mike's equipment for research.</br>  Was thinking of picking it up based on this pic.  I enjoyed it few laughs i mean its nothing special Threads are trash though thanks to /pol/ and /sci/  <br>The cumming part was 10/10</br>  <br> /sci/ <br>What do you mean? I haven't watched it or participated in threads because &gt;funi, but how is /sci/ causing shit?</br></br>  <br> Girls like these never win <br>Why must everything l love suffer such fate?</br></br>  I think it's good to see a girl who is not ashamed of everything in the ecchi anime.

"Funishit" is not clever or funny. Even "funimashit" is better than that.</br>  <br>Or maybe you could see it for yourself instead of making a shit thread.</br>  <br> implying I'm going to waste nearly another hour of my life on a show that has already shown me what it has to offer and which I already dislike <br>I have better things to waste my life on</br></br>  <br>Nah nigga those eyes are fine.</br>  <br>Sleepy scientist is the best archetype.</br>  <br>Especially when she's sleepy from staying up all night researching dicks.</br>  One mouth is to tell you what you want to hear, the other is the one that says what she really means.

Also had the single best first episode so far.  Anyway to watch the uncensored version with subs?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127711432 <br>my friend wanted me to watch gangsta cause its based in America apparently. <br><br>also, stop shit posting and get gold already.<br><br><br>This show made me yooooo about 15 times especially that cumming scene. Out of the 9 shows I've seen so far this is my favorite</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>THIS IMAGE THAT'S BEEN SITTING IN MY SAUCE FOLDER FOR A YEAR AND A HALF WAS FROM THIS!</br></br></br>  <br> my friend wanted me to watch gangsta cause its based in America apparently. <br><br>looks more like some sort of italian pace imo</br></br></br>  Unfunny garbage but I like the concept enough to give it another episode. Will probably drop.  Good ass show. Knows exactly what its about and doesn't try to be something its not.Terrorist-chan is pretty cute, I hope she ends up winning the Moralsbowl. Plus, the ED was surprisingly catchy (SOX! SOX! SOX! SOX! SOX!)  <br>Faggot.<br>Hyouka best girl.</br></br>  <br>for you</br>  <br>Goddammit that looked like a blowjob in the thumbnail.

Morals-kun needs to end up with Closet Pervert Student Council Pres   and leave Terrorist-chan for me  </br>  <br>i will kill you if you say that charlotte is the best</br>  SOX? More like SEX.  why is everyone in this show wearing dog collars?  I don't really think that it's good enough to watch.<br><br>It has a premise that is just sort of ridiculous, but not in a way where it can really create a lot of great situational comedy. I feel like everything they can do with the setting they have already explored, so it's going to be repeats.<br><br>SYD has better dirty jokes and a more fun cast.<br>Other shows have more extreme/ridiculous premises. <br><br>This just doesn't have a very compelling premise and it isn't that good at setting up really fun gags. It's stuff I've seen elsewhere but done better.<br><br>Watch the first episode you'll know minutes in whether or not you want to follow it. I didn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's social commentary about how humans in a heavily censored society are no better than dogs.</br>   keep seeing thumbnail <br> 2nd thumbnail looks like she is fellating MC <br> 3rd is deepthroat <br><br>damn it murakami and your horseface</br></br></br></br>  <br>I respect your post.</br>  <br> It's social commentary about how humans in a heavily censored society are no better than dogs </br>  <br> he hasn't read 1984 </br>  <br>it's fucking blatant you idiot</br>  <br> it's fucking blatant you idiot </br>  <br><br>I'm waiting for decent subs</br></br>  <br>YOKKORA<br>O<br>K<br>K<br>O<br>R<br>A</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Symphogear is #1</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127718327 <br>Works everywhere. The girl with the panties on her face can say whatever she wants for 3 minutes a day.</br>   Go to doctor <br> Can't use anatomical words <br><br>Also, how isn't there a mass of teen pregnancy? Studies show that areas that lack health education end having lots of unwanted pregnancies. Actually, considering Japan is going extinct, they're just digging a faster grave with this policy.</br></br></br>  I thought it was just going to be a show about meaningless fanservice and boring dick jokes, but it was actually pretty funny. They have a good boke and tsukommi routine going on so far. Picked up.  <br>How did this get aired on live tv</br>  <br> Side character <br> Story doesn't use her more than once per volume <br>   Has a boyfriend. <br><br>How am I supposed ot self-insert into this series!?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A ton of Japanese kids are going to grow up with a very weird fetish.</br>  <br>Isn't that normal over there.</br>  <br>Having weird fetishes or having a fetish for flies? Because I only saw that in one doujin.</br>  <br> tfw I know exactly what your talking about <br>Shit was weird. <br>http://nhentai.net/g/129648/</br></br></br>  <br><br>yes, yes you are. <br><br>Girls with tired eyes are best girls.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Anon, they're not tired eyes. They just the eyes of a girl who hasn't figured out how to put a sponge in some foundation and dab a few times then wipe make up across her face.<br><br>0/10 would not bang.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>Chokers are super cute.</br>  <br>I already knew what that was going to be before I checked the link. Fapped 2 or 3 times to it I think.</br>  <br>Those eyes are the only reason I am even considering picking up this show. So yes i love those kind of eyes.</br>  So the premise is that Japan is not allow to swear or say lewd things right? Can't they just fuck without talking and be scot free?    <br>It'd be better (could be better, in the future) if they cut back on the random sex references and either focused more on character interactions or just went full over-the-top with it - sex jokes being actual terrorism and causing mass chaos and stuff has potential.</br>  <br>Honestly? Its pretty great, I'm gettin desperate for more episodes</br>  <br>This is the exact moment when I started liking her and became accepting of her crusade against "Morality Enforcement".<br><br>More Japanese need to embrace this mindset instead of their two-faced refusal of natural sexual feelings.</br></br></br>  Who is subbing this? Funi, Hiryuu and who else?<br><br>Hiryuu from what I researched doesn't have that good of a track record and also I think they haven't even subbed it yet. Funi is hardsubbed and the translation quality isnt't that great</br></br>  <br>No, it goes beyond words to not being able to do anything of an "immoral" nature, because it is "damaging to society". during the intro it shows a random group of kids who have managed to gain a case of porno novels being arrested and their collection burnt with flamethrowers.<br><br>Also you could get away with having sex without being discovered by the chokers but the kids at this high society moral school the series takes place at are so pure they don't even know what sex actually is, unlike the MC who was originally from a shitty school and the terrorist girl who is a covert colossal pervert.<br>Plus not being able to use dirty talk during the act is unforgivable tyranny.</br></br></br></br>  Moralskun is a bit of s fab tbh<br><br>He needs to change before I think about whether or not I want panty commander to win his bowl</br></br>  <br>Please tell me you're lying</br>  <br> too pure for sex </br>  <br>The fact that she puts his pants off means that she knows what sex is.<br><br>Pure my ass, she's an hypocrital bitch and I hate her already</br></br></br>  <br>What did they conduces?</br>  <br>Context to this rape scene?</br>  <br>one thing that threw me off was<br> "hey our birthrate is almost kill but lets make an anime where all things    lewd   is illegal and throw in a bunch of fan service"</br></br>  <br> Am i the only who who hates this girl's eyes? <br><br>Yes</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I don't like her attitude either, she reminds me of many people I've encounterd in my life.</br>  The manga version seems pretty bad compared to the anime adaptation.  <br>How far in is this shit?</br>   that OOOHOHOHOHO <br><br><br>that a fact?</br></br></br>  If you are counting that as a mouth then shouldn't they actually have FIVE mouths?  <br>You're not only a faggot, but also a retard</br>  <br>I was makings of the jokes, anon</br>  <br>asshole pussy mouth nose ears<br>but i think she meant her breasts to be the 4th hole but if she includes that then she would have to include armpits and thighs as well</br></br>  <br><br>I think she meant the  urethra </br></br>  <br>Help! A massive grin is on my face and it wont leave!</br>  <br> has a boyfriend <br>That doesn't even make sense.</br></br>  <br>The one where you cant show nipples on TV.. oh wait, that was USA.</br>  Still waiting for not-eyecancer fansubs  <br> Has a boyfriend <br>So you're telling me she's a filthy unfaithful whore who invites other men to impregnate her behind her boyfriend's back? I refuse to believe this slander, Jesus.</br></br>  <br> Has a boyfriend </br>  <br>This anime strangely reminds me of  Euphoria VN </br>  I'll watch this in a year if BDs get subbed I guess  <br><br>Why are slavs always the best anime characters?</br></br>   SYD but with terrorism <br>Aight.</br>     etchii humor <br>Is<br>Is there any other form of humor more repugnant and lowbrow? I mean besides puns</br></br>  I'm willing to bet that pic related is Ayame's mum.  <br> &gt;Posts on /a/ <br> &gt;Tries to act like he's a cultured individual <br>Seriously anon?</br></br></br>  <br>your taste</br>  <br>Etchii humor comes from how taboo a thing is and one normally should not use such language. There are no taboos here on /a/ so making the comparison between etchii humor and /a/ post is erroneous because we say whatever the fuck we want and only the most closetted normalfag would find it taboo. If you find humor in some character simple saying "cock! Ass! Pussy! xDD" then you are literally 12</br>  <br>You retard, the Joke is how the repressed society reacts to a teenage girl dressed in a sheet shouting such phrases as if she was Osama Bin Laden</br>  <br> NTR <br><br>FUCKING <br><br>DROPPED</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Is there any other form of humor more repugnant and lowbrow? <br>Reaction images and memes.</br></br>  <br>NTR?</br>  <br> etchii <br>Just fucking kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>I'd say the story is setting up terroristfu and the MC to be the main couple. Even though the MC likes the president it's pretty clear that he'll change his ways eventually</br>  I want to masturbate to Ayame.  <br><br>I want her to step on my dick then sit on my face</br></br>  This woman was a villain worse than hitler and stalin combined.<br><br>Gorilla-kun would likely have been executed by the state over that false accusation.</br></br>  Read the guide before asking anything buyfag related, contains all the basic info and much more:<br><br>http://buyfag.moe</br></br>  The other side.<br>(I don't even know if this is the same girl)</br>  <br>Bitch, come at me.<br>Just complete my "Chris a cute" and "Doge Days" deck.</br></br>  <br><br>You'd know who they are, but you're a filthy casual so fuck you.</br></br>  <br>Thanks, but google tells me it's a mexican recipe ;_;. <br><br><br>It's pretty mean...</br></br></br></br>  Does this look like a safe buy?<br><br>http://m.ebay.ca/itm/221784970886?_<wbr>mwBanner=1</wbr></br></br>  Lewd.   boiling good meat <br>Disgusting.</br>  <br> Alice not inside <br> Old hag is <br>Why Tosh?</br></br></br>  Hisako looks a bit weird here.  Why do nips bring their towels into the bath?  <br>I don't think this is an accurate representation of Japanese culture</br>  <br>Have you not watched JAVs?</br>  <br>Has Tosh ever drawn up an official breast size chart for the characters?</br>  <br>Nope, but I think Sonoka has the largest tits of them all.<br><br>The next tier would be Erina, Alice, Meat, &amp; Ryouko, in no particular order.</br></br></br>  <br>Depends on the onsen.<br><br>Much of the time you are allowed a face towel that you basically use for the slightest bit of modesty when you're getting in or out.<br><br>Western-friendly onsens may allow total towel wearing such as in the pic.<br><br>Some onsens forbid towels entirely.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I forgot to factor in the alumni, as well.

Can't recall) that mentioned how Erina had a design in mind where she had amazing assets all around but not being the biggest. Her tits and they're no bigger than Ryouko's, her hips are childbearing but no bigger than others, etc.<br><br>Jack of all trades, master of none.  My preference. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's because this shit was made before volume 4 came out, which is when Alice was introduced.<br>What, you can't fucking read or something? It says so right there on the fucking image.</br></br>  <br> Meat <br> good <br><br>She's worse than well done meat.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought it was the Chinks that do that.</br>  <br>I'd rather see the 3rd years interacting with the 1st years.<br><br> Rindou-nee when? </br></br></br>  <br>Why is Erina bathing with plebs?</br>  <br>There's only one bath.</br>  Baseball poster in high quality, I think it wasn't posted here yet.  <br>they are richer than you think.<br>Nikumi's family owns a massive meat company<br>Hisako's family has a long history with Nakiri.<br>Even Megumi's family run a local inn.<br>We don't know the background for Yuuki and Ryouko yet ,it won't be suprising their family business are related to their specialties.</br></br></br></br></br>  Shinji had no problems holding Rei, now, did he? Unlike other girls.  Because she's his mom, even most hardcore permavirgin autists who never knew the touch of another woman would at least be fine with hugging their mother.    <br>Because Rei got the message across.</br>  Rei is a nice girl and deserves to be held lovingly.<br>Unlike other girls.</br>  <br>This is incest.</br>  <br> Shinji had no problems holding Rei, now, did he? Unlike other girls. <br>Speaks volumes about the girls, now, does it?</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but the real question is would he be down to suck Rei's dick? Yeah, didn't think so.</br>  Rei  a shit.   <br>They're both awful characters in an awful anime, but the childhood friend actually calling out the harem MC on his bullshit for once was kinda rare.</br>  Rei is worth holding.  This entire fucking scene just made me cheer.<br> tfw I know what's in store in 3.0 but haven't gotten the nerve to watch it. </br>  <br>3.33 is a bad movie, just forget it exists.</br>    <br>Nothing happened in it anyway, apart from some Michael Bay-tier fights, and every character reaching new heights of mental retardation. Might as well just skip it and wait for 3.0+1.0. (which will be even worse)</br>  <br><br><br>It can't be THAT bad, can it?</br></br></br>  <br>It is.</br>  <br>It is that bad.</br>  <br>It's not.

I was unaware forced slideshow backstory and no decent interaction with Kaji, Misato was good character development. I was unaware ebin strong man self-insert MC Shinji Ikari was good character development. Thank you for opening my eyes, anon-kun!</br>  <br>its worse</br>  <br>Now you're moving goalposts; first no character development and now you've moved it to what you consider "good" character development.<br><br>I'll take that as you being too stubborn to concede, thank you.<br><br>Also, the character development is good enough.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody claimed it was good, fuck off retard.</br>  <br> characters acting like happy-go-lucky fanfiction bullshit is considering good writing and quality characterization <br>Only on /a/</br></br>  COOKING MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU DO IT?  <br>Everything you just said makes me want to punch something. I'm going to go punch something. No, probably several things. And then I'm going to hide this post so I don't have to do it again.<br><br>Hopefully you'll also go die somewhere, lonely and forgotten.

And it's bloody glorious. <br><br>The golden stuff usually gets posted whenever there are those occasional pokemon threads, so if you browse the archives you should fine them pretty easily. My favorite is the one where that one delusional Misty shipper made it their headcanon that the new girl was some sort of Yandere stalker.

Supposedly she's 27 according to an official booklet or something.</br>  time for a new thread?  <br>The lack of porn of her is disturbing</br>  <br>Not even at bump limit.</br>  <br>Zero Aika isn't that different from regular Aika aside from hair style and a micro skirt and maybe different sleeve ends.</br>  First episode tomorrow. Let's keep this thread going till then.<br><br>Cautiously optimistic for Papa Bones.</br></br>  What lag? it's fine in the usual place.  <br>whats the soft the stream is using?</br>  its total dead now  <br>please anon-kun save us from this horrible horrible streamer</br>  <br><br>Please share, not all of us livewatch ona regular basis.</br></br>  Why do we hate her again?  <br>No, because she ruined a potentially much more interesting story and premise and turned it into some boring, predictable x-men shit.</br>  <br>The premise was all about X-Men, your own fault for going in blind.</br>  <br> cheating <br>The only one that actually knew that was him, and he was only cheating on tests, that doesn't make someone an asshole.<br>Cheating on a lottery or gambling, now thats an asshole. <br> starting fights. <br>That was the only way he could retaliate or risk having to fight the whole lot at the same time, from anyone's point of you he's good looking and gets amazing grades, it wouldn't be far fetched for delinquents to mess with him. <br> putting others at risk for personal gain <br>Look at his face, he's relieved. While it's true he did put the driver and the girl at risk he certainly didn't want it to end badly.<br>He used his ability to get the friend out of harms way, he obviously didn't factor in that the driver wouldn't be able to regain control, he's like 16 and probably never attempt something with such high stakes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I didn't think much of her at first, but after seeing so many anons in this thread being so reasonable, I starting to really like her.<br><br>I hope she kicks that retarded criminal MC's ass harder next episode.</br></br>  I'm confused. Does she work for the government or something?<br>By what authority can she prevent him from traveling about on his own?</br>   Chapter 219 <br> Coming 7/17 <br>very looking forward to the return of D.Gray-man. hopefully the new chapter will explain what the hell was going down in chapter 218.<br><br>also...Johnny is so dying isn't he?</br></br></br></br>  I hate myself for being too lazy to re-read previous chapters. I enjoyed DGM a lot but after all the hiatus, it doesn't make sense anymore.  <br>It takes only one or two hours at most. DGM is not Naruto or OP</br>  <br> 200+ chapters <br> 1 hour <br>Are you drunk? Fuck off speedreader</br></br></br>  <br>You probably can just re-read from level 4 Akuma arc and go from there. I think the most confusing and forgetable part was that part onward.</br>  <br>That makes sense. I'll do it when we get the new chapter.</br></blockquote>]
