Might be good.</br>  <br>we need this but with a nice loop</br>  <br>how many episodes will the anime have? is S2 already confirmed?</br>  <br>Why don't you scoot back to  ?</br>  <br>you mean any person that base his liking to anything the media says.</br>  <br><br>Nope, Kirie x Alex is the only way</br></br>  <br> you will never be his imouto and be spoiled to oblivion </br>    <br><br>Doujins when?</br></br>  <br><br>I thought that the shipping was a joke</br></br>  <br>Anime is out, probably around the next season, if someone gets his shit done right now, mid season.</br>  Umaru is a garbage sister for the early part of the manga but she grows on you. The manga really comes into its own once it stops latching on so hard to the "umaru's an ass to oniichan" gimmick and starts introducing the other girls. Kirie and Sylphin are great once they actually get introduced and start hanging around the group, and Ebina is always good. Oniichan is better when his role is reduced in the story and he can be a cook and do his own shit instead of just the straight man that gets antagonized<br><br>tl;dr the anime was always going to open slow with umaru just being a shit because thats how the manga opened. she becomes a lot more toned down and caring as the series goes on<br><br><br> Kirie and Alex <br>into the fucking garbage you go</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So what the fuck is this series about? The first episode was kind of underwhelming. Gonna stick with it a few more episodes but hopefully the entire premise isn't just perfect girl is a lazy piece of shit at home.  <br/>  <br><br>Imouto(s) and Onii-chan(s)</br></br>  <br>Holy shit I'm tired.</br>  <br> more toned down and caring <br>About how many chapters before it becomes noticeable?</br></br>  Didn't the manga end? If i recall it was shitty as fuck too  <br><br> Ep1 already shitpost on Kirie awesomeness. She only like Umaru and Alex is a joke. </br></br>  <br>Thanks for explaining based anon.<br><br>I feel the way that Umaro grows on you is the similar like a real sibling, probably you find it annoying and see her as a huge brat, wish to the person to change at first, but when you two are having a good time together you don't seem to mind much, specially when you notice those moments that the annoying sibling care for you too.<br><br>Some series become good when you analize their progress.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No?</br>  <br><br> Kirie awesomeness <br><br><br>She is an autistic shitty imouto with based Bomber, and not in the cute Umaru way</br></br></br></br></br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/fmfyyiyedj.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>   Umaru is a GSfag <br>Literally worst imouto ever.</br>  <br>Can't say, when you realize she is more toned and caring, the change happen in a way that you don't noticed at first, is a very gradual thing.</br>  <br>Kirie shows up around chapter 15-20 and once her arc is done they basically start throwing in the other girls just as much as the brother until the point where they become the protagonists.<br><br>She's always going to be a brat to her brother since that's her whole deal, and they still have a bunch of chapters devoted to it, but the entire manga stops revolving around that joke and they both start being more overt about their caring for each other<br><br><br>the manga isn't even close to ending, it's over 100 chapters already and they're still going</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Lazy sex doujins when?  <br>Bomber fucking when?</br>  <br>hammer master race</br>  It's funny hearing people complain about how shitty Umaru treats her brother because the tonality of their relationship changes so dramatically over the course of the manga that you start to wonder if they're just going to bang. so from the position of knowing that and keeping up with it, it's just kind of humorous to see all the anger<br><br>every other chapter now seems to have them either spending time together or thinking about each other while another character comments on how happy or devoted they are<br><br>if Kirie and TSF weren't blatantly homo and the leaders in the great Umaru chase, this would seem like a very obvious incest manga. hell, it still could be</br></br></br></br>  lyger when?  <br>I'm not really sweating Umaru coz it's the first episode. It's like me dropping Love Hina for Naru being a huge prick.</br>  <br><br>Don't be that dense anon</br></br>  Otaku pan-  <br>Please I just want comfy brother-sister relationship and some cute friends in the mix, I don't want Oreimu to happen again, one tragedy was enough.</br>  うまるーん  <br>what`s this shit about?</br>    <br> ` </br>  <br><br>Is about a guy that wants to fuck his  mother<br/> </br></br>  <br>Is this show the Evangelion of anime?</br>  <br>holy shit you are far past autistic</br>  So it's Oreimo but more slice of life.<br>We'll find out they actually want to fuck each other mid-season 2 and everyone will get mad while mangafags say they should have seen it coming.</br>  <br> So it's Oreimo but more slice of life. <br>Neither are SOL, nor is this like Oreimo.</br></br>  <br>The first episode seemed to cover the first 6 or so chapters of the manga. The ones immediately after that (the chapter about the pet contest to win money) involve Ebina exposition and then they briefly show Bomber and Alex at work. So probably soon, although I don't think he has a big role until Kirie shows up in a bigger capacity. So maybe ep 3. <br><br><br>They're pretty heavy on Kiries crush on Umaru (and Sylphin's crush on "UMR") but it's mostly a friendship manga. The romance really isn't any kind of subplot other than Kirie being incredibly gay</br></br></br></br>  <br>This post makes it seem exactly like Oreimo.<br>You could replace names and it'd be straight out of a season 1 Oreimo thread. <br/></br></br>  <br><br>100 chapters later and still no incest, just cute stuff</br></br>  <br>I wrote that post but I'll say Oreimo seemed like it was straight up going to be a romance whereas Himouto has never really made that a focal point at all. It's more about her trying to pile on secrets and dealing with not actually being herself in front of her friends. <br><br>We're 100 chapters deep on the manga and Umaru doesn't seem to give a single fuck about romance whereas Ebina and Kanou want to fuck oniichans brains out, and Kirie and Sylphin want to scissor the fuck out of Umaru</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks God. The market is so filled with incest of brothers that this is refreshing.</br>  <br> /a/ meetup </br>  I just found this cute Dogakobo image but I didn't know what to say while posting it so I won't say anything.<br>Thank you Dogakobo.</br>  <br> It's more about her trying to pile on secrets and dealing with not actually being herself in front of her friends. <br>You're just making it worse</br></br>  <br>Anymore stitches?</br>  <br>/a/ wishes they were that fun. More like /a/ would sit around awkwardly and not talk.</br>  <br>man i dont give a shit about oreimo but that was obviously going to be incest because it's fucking titled "my sister is cute"</br>  What most of you don't realize is that the brother himself needs Umaru as much as she him. He is literally incapable of living by himself without fulfilling Umaru's needs from time to time. I heard this is some kind of psychological sickness but I forgot the name. Needless to say they are helping each other out.  <br>I just want to add that there's a chance that they're both not blood related but I really don't see either of them fucking each other in any way, unlike in Oreimo where it's pretty easy to see the sexual tension there.</br>  <br>No indications of romantic or sexual tension between the characters in the manga.<br><br>But if you really think it's the same then don't bother watching it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Is just mother complex</br></br>  <br>He's just too efficient and also too autistic. He's a complete busybody and in the chapter where Umaru left for some reason he just sat around bored because he didn't have work to do.</br>    <br>Nah, it's not as bad as the other way around. Umaru needs him more than he needs her. Oni just needs someone to pamper while Umaru pretty much needs Taihei.<br><br>I believe this may have come from his weird dreams of the grown-up Umaru and not being as pampered as a kid.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't really think it's the same, I'm just finding it amusing how so many things line up word for word with old and new Oreimo threads. <br><br>For example, this  is essentially Kyousuke's character arc. <br><br>The difference here is with Oreimo threads it was mostly people in denial while here it's fairly well founded that it's not going into incest territory.</br></br></br></br></br>    Is this the same girl from the high school flashback? Is she ever not lusting after Taihei's dick?    <br>Not true. Umaru is actually capable on managing her life by herself by evidence of het able to maintain her room's tidiness when she thought she's a burden to Taihei. She's also capable of maintaining her social life albeit not genuine (Yahari fans here) case in point is her TMR persona. She also can manage her money so that she doesn't actually die of hunger until her next allowance. Also when it comes to serious stuff she's capable of holding her desires, she rejected when Sylphy's mom offered to buy her the game she wanted. Needless to say Umaru knows how to prioritize, it's because her brother spoiled her all the time that she became useless moeblob</br>  <br>"Whose is that umbrella?" is perfectly correct. It's a strange phrasing, but no part of it is actually wrong, nor would it be misunderstood.</br>  <br>yeah, his boss has had a thing for him since they were in high school together.</br>  <br>Boss and Bomber is the secret endgame, better get on it now before it's too late</br>       Watch first episode of something and like it <br> Read all of the manga in a sitting <br>I'll probably still watch it too, but I always wonder if I would have had more fun with my fist experience with the story being weekly and animated.</br></br>  Umaru is not that bad, Kirie on other hand  <br>I never said she wasn't unable to live her life without him. Just that she needs (need in the want fashion, not in the she can't be without fashion) him more than he needs her.</br>  Ebina is such an ebin fat girl.  <br>*was</br>  <br>So is he a siscon? Or just a dick-less vortex of asexuality?</br>  <br>She did mention she got lucky.</br>  <br> Literally cancer race <br><br>Abandon quest</br></br></br>  <br>Someone needs to give this bitch a brush</br>  Man, she is the biggest cunt  <br>I enjoy the manga, the anime was good but somehow now i cant stand her.</br>  <br>Did I stutter? I didn't say longsword did I?</br>  <br>Dickless vortex. Ebina very, very clearly wants the D but he doesn't notice.<br><br><br>I give Kirie a pass because Bomber literally can't even recognize her when they all go on vacation and outright asks why she would make cookies if she has no friends<br><br>I love Bomber and it's obvious he cares for Kirie but he's kind of a dumbass and his sister is just autistic</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She is good girl and imouto   too bad that her onii-chan doesn't care about her </br></br>  <br><br>Pic</br></br>  <br>Talk for you faggot, next you are going to say all of us are fatasses or skeletors. Some of us enjoy chinese cartoons and are fit.</br>  <br>I thank ye kindly for all the stitches, anon.</br>  <br>Sure</br>  <br>dogakobo has that effect sometimes.<br>look at  YuruYuri </br></br>  <br>having read all of the manga that's been scanlated, i dont think it takes anything away from the anime. having some of this shit animated is a big deal, the voices they picked are perfect, and they've added some nice touches that weren't in the story (Kirie and Sylphin being pushed a bit more right from the start, for example)<br><br><br>because when you read current chapters of the manga it isn't all about her being an ass to her brother like the early chapters are<br><br>you basically went from reading about a character who's already gone through a decent amount of development back to square 1 so obviously you'd be annoyed</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Bomber can't even recognize Umaru, so he is like her sister</br></br>    <br><br>Looks like the eyeball lady monster from Bloodborne.</br></br>    <br>That's true, I'd say Bomber and Kirie are both social retards. He's just a different kind of social retard in that he has no filter or attention to detail as opposed to Kirie's Watamote-style autism and obsession with Umaru (Kirie's a better person than Tomoko though)<br><br>Bomber's like that bro you bring along when you go out but he says a ton of stupid shit that no one should say in public and gets everyone into a bar fight</br></br></br>  <br>Totally envious, since  I ran out of cola earlier today. </br>    Share a coke with Umaru.  <br>Umaro is probably more fragile in the emotional part than we think.<br><br><br>After giving some thinking to Taihei flashbacks, I assume that something happen to their mother, because of her death their family probably have some economic problems (it looks like they lived in a luxury place before). Taihei decide to live for himself so he won't be a problem to his family. Umaro is left alone with their father but her father probably lives working all day and Umaro feel alone and abandoned in their luxury penthouse. Decide to go to live with her brother that is the only family member she still feel close. Their father is probably the one that still pay for Umaro studies.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Bomber is actually a social retard around girls</br></br>  <br>Better than S&amp;S or mount-whoring insect glaives</br>  <br> vortex of asexuality <br><br>Probably this, he is basically married to the job, on those chapters where he have a vacation and manage to do everthing on the house early in the day, he spend the rest of the day zoning out. No hobbies, no real drive for anything and plain as one can be. <br><br><br>You are probably reviving your feelings when you start reading the manga, she was a cunt at first.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Post Sylphy</br></br>   nice boat     Ebina? More like Ebina :DDD  <br>Except, it's not.</br>  And done  <br>Thanks anon, keep up the hard work.</br>   seiyuus are all literal who's <br>Shows like this can either go awesome or shit. No inbetween.</br>  I thought this was just going to be a 5-min web series, not a full half hour show.  <br>Same, I could have sworn I read somewhere that it was gonna be a short. Glad it's not though.</br>  <br>Based on some arbitrary rule you pulled from your ass?</br>  <br>Kirie had a couple of main roles, the other 3 either nothing or some background characters</br>  <br>I was floored when I learned both this and Sore ga Seiyuu! were full length shows, at least this one had decent pacing though.</br>  Honest question.<br><br>Do you guys enjoy this because Umaru is cute and similar to yourselves (at least when at home)? Or is there something else, like the other girls?<br><br>Because it was aggravating to watch the entire first scene about the manga she wanted. She didn't really get much better later on, her brother is too forgiving and a doormat.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Petition to put Umaru in every dictionary under the entry 'adorable.'</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mangafags, is my animeonly impression that this is best girl correct? I'm usually right about these things from the beginning.</br>  <br><br>That's correct, also best imouto</br></br>  <br>I like Kirie and Kanou more</br>  I've seen Ebina for a total of like 3 minutes and I've already deduced she is absolute best girl of all girls, I'm in love. Also, the show is pretty fucking great.  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Can't blame oniichan for having a mother complex.</br>  <br>you have my support.<br><br><br>You are close, but again, all girls are best girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Do you guys enjoy this because Umaru is cute and similar to yourselves (at least when at home)? Or is there something else, like the other girls? <br>I enjoy it because it has cute girls in it and they do cute things. What a silly question to ask /a/.</br></br>  <br>Sorry for doubting your ability to judge all the content of a work instead of only the parts that appeal to you.</br>  New girl?  <br> mangafox </br>  <br>I don't usually watch shows that are cute for the sake of being cute. If a show is comfy but also cute? sure. Is a show trying to be deep while also cute? I usually say fuck off. The show in question is more about the comfiness and silliness with the brother and family, it's several degrees away from the norm. Though ive only read the mango so far.</br>  Reminder that Umaru smells like Citrus.  <br>*stinky farts</br>  I want to see her in her neet outfit but with her normal body  <br>The manga goes with comfy slice of life with cute moments (specially when Umaro smile on her chibi form) but I find it really enjoyable.</br>  <br>Well its the same studio, they did yui yuri and nozaki so doga has an established rubber style. I see the similarities, both are princesses with a different side to them but Maki is much more genuine and her lust for a boyfriend and dopeyness adds to her princess aura rather then take away from it. Don't get me wrong, hamster girl is cute and I really think she nails the little sister appeal but she isn't nearly as human and genuine as Natsuo.   and really can you beat perfection?  </br>  <br>Jesus christ that looks like ass.</br>  <br>If you speak ebonics.</br>  <br>Probably.</br>    <br>Oh cool, I didn't know it was Dogakobo doing this.</br>  <br>I just like the stupid faces she makes and such but her character is otaku bait. People who have her, Kirino, Tomoko and Konata should go away forever.</br>  <br>new lost little sister?</br>  Death by moe is real.  Umaru a Mary Sue, bad sister, and generally a shit.<br><br>Ebina is much better.</br></br>  <br>the OP really addicting</br>  <br>tfw can't watch anime on tv because i'm too blind to read the subs at a distance</br>  I found this show to be of an above average level of enjoyability.  <br>Plus, Ebina's got bigger knockers.</br>  Do you guys read manga upside down too?<br><br>Maybe I should get an exercise ball as well.<br><br>Seems Umaru knows what is best.</br></br></br></br>  <br>like Yuru Yuri back then</br>  <br> The little video game segments <br>I am actually having mental difficulties with this.</br></br>  <br><br><br> holy shit you are far past autistic <br><br>Not that anon, and I agree, he must be ridiculously neurotic to have caught that, but what the fuck? That's really really weird. Who would possibly use that thing instead of a normal apostrophe? It's not like you could just do it by accident.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I feel sorry for the onii-chan, this made me want to fix my life.</br>  Was the potato eating scene a death note reference?  It's like i'm watching Kirino 2.0.  <br>But Umaru isn't even 1/4th as obnoxious as Kirino.</br>  <br>It's almost like I'm watching myself not knowing what I'm talking about.</br>    <br>Mostly because everything is cute, I love cute shows and I want to see that girl with the bedhair get more screentime.</br>  <br>I guess. But she is more of mary sue. Eat shit and looks like model, doesn't study and get perfect marks etc.</br>  bruh is this show serious? <br><br>fucking AOTS</br></br>  <br>Yes, anon, every chip eating scene is a reference to Death Note.<br>Lays confirmed for being run by weebs.</br></br>  fucking goldmine for reaction images  how did she transform? is she not human?  <br>I'm pretty autistic, I'll admit, but it's pretty noticeable though. It leaves a huge space between the letters as opposed to an apostrophe and it perplexes me for the reasons you stated.</br>  <br>Honestly it hit close to home, I'm well liked and have got my shit together financially, but the moment I get home I turn into a slob.<br>I should probably change that.</br></br>  <br>Oniichan have a hard life<br>He probably doesn't want Umaru to be lonely like he did when his mom died something</br></br>  <br>Pretty much. Kirino is shit for being obnoxious. Umaru is shit for being top Mary Sue.</br>  <br><br> Afro <br><br>Is that a Bomber Rathalos?</br></br></br></br>  Why is manzai the only type of comedy in anime  So this is basically Oreimo but without going for the incest route? Sounds interesting. Also<br> DOGAKOBO <br>AOTS already.</br></br>  Umaruuun~<br><br>based dogakoboo</br></br>   dat OP <br>Great energetic one <br>Warms the heart</br></br>  How many chapters did they cover?  <br>Not sure what you mean by obnoxious having in mind that Oreimo is about the personal grown of Kirino and Kyouske during the series, by the end of it Kirino is not obnoxious at all, not sure how this series doing in the manga, so I couldn't give an opinion on it.</br>  <br>same, everytime I see this segment , I cant help but crack a smile</br>  <br>akarin~</br>  <br>Chapters 1-2 and 4-6.</br>  BRAVO, CR.<br><br>Subs say "Tuesday Variety," but it's 木曜　as in 木曜日or as we say in burgerland, fucking Thursday. Professional Translators who can't even remember the days of the week in Japanese.<br><br>Also, can't wait to get an actual subbed version so I can understand all the lyrics to the OP, it's already my favorite new one of the season I think. <br><br>Decent first episode, Umaru is a terrible brat but an adorable one, like Sakurako but in a totally different way. There's something irresistable about cute girls who roll around on the floor all the time like that.<br><br>Manga has been on my backlog for a while. I will probably catch up now, so I guess the show has done its job already.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My favorite TL error is the line that makes it sound like Umaru spends her evenings reading wikis about herself that exist for some reason (???) when she just reads otaku blogs/aggregators. How the hell did they fuck that up?</br>  <br><br>It's cool anon, I'm totally obsessing over it now as well. Guess we're both autistic. At least we aren't that other guy though. Who the fuck types that way? Was it some elaborate ruse to troll punctuation-conscious anons or what? Fuck that guy.</br></br>  I'm confused, is the audience supposed to like Umaru? Because I seriously want to bash her skull in right now.  <br>She's meant to be an otaku waifu.<br><br> omg she's just like me <br> smart but lazy but attractive!  <br> and she plays video games!! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes, that one really bothered me as well.</br></br>  <br>She gets better later, but she's absolute shit at the beginning.</br>  <br>I don't really dislike her, but her personality is pretty bad.<br> Ms. Perfection in the outside, filthy otaku on the inside <br>Both are pretty unhealthy lifestyle.</br></br></br>  <br>She's meant to be like shin-chan except without the funny or the fact that he's a retarded 5 year old.</br>  <br>Please don't compare her to a legend like Shin-chan.</br>  Kirie reminds me of a chipmunk, in a cute way.  <br>I will never forgive that mountain.</br>  <br>Too soon man, too soon.</br>  <br> except without the funny <br><br>you got that right</br></br></br>  <br>How much later? If it's going to take more than a few episodes to get there, fuck this.</br>  <br>I heard that Japs can't into english because they start learning it at 16. Is that true?</br>  <br>Anon, do you know Spanish even though you took it in school?<br><br>It's like that everywhere. Second language in public schools is a joke everywhere in the world.</br></br></br>  <br>They start in elementary school. They can't into English because they're taught it poorly.<br><br> although my grandmother says she couldn't into it in school because she was dumb <br><br> Her English still isn't all that great </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> character is supposedly god tier in English <br> is absolutely terrible at it but passed off as amazing anyway <br>I hate this cliche.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You are meant to find her cute and like her when it's shown she cares for her brother when things are serious.</br></br>  <br>It's not a cliche though, it's the VAs not knowing English.</br>  <br>Can we hope for some wincest?<br>Or at least some cute imouto more scene? First ep was not that good.</br></br>  <br>There has got to be at least one that knows it, right?</br>    <br>The show would be redeemed if the next episode starts with Umaru's funeral.</br>  <br><br>That face is so lewd.</br></br>  <br>I don't know about VAs, but https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KHZ<wbr>yvk8q5Xc</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Damn, what a shocker.</br>  suddenly i want buy this  <br>and set it on fire?</br>  <br>No shit. Doesn't change the fact that Umaru is a retarded cunt when not portraying her outside persona. Her brother is a pushover and should just tell her to go fuck herself if she plans on staying at his place and being difficult. God forbid anyone be logical in anime/manga.</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>She still couldn't shake off the accent, this is a better example<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hlg<wbr>c3_4WL0M</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  this show reeks of weeaboo wish-fulfillment.<br><br>also where is the comedy</br></br>  HEY としあき<br><br>Why did you cut out?<br> It was pretty good. <br><br>HEY HEY としあき</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>looks pretty easy to put into a butthole</br></br>  I can't stand Umaru but is it worth watching this show for Ebina? She is relevant, right?   Ebina <br> Ebin </br>  <br>ｗ</br>  <br>But she loves and he likes making her a spoiled cunt. We see that she can live alone perfectly fine, it's her brother who loves to have her around.</br>  <br>There is no comedy, not in the manga either. The parts of her being at home are supposed to be comedic.</br>  <br>no <br><br>shit<br><br>is this the first time you've seen this trope or what?</br></br></br></br></br>   tfw no taihei nii-chan to spoil you <br> ;_; </br>   not putting effort in studies and living like a total otaku slob <br> still doing exceptionally well in school <br><br>I hate this trope.</br></br></br>  <br>No.<br><br><br>I don't understand what you are complaining about. Is the audience supposed to like Umaru? yes, when you see the difference between her daily life and when things are more serious. Which is what I wrote in my post.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i thought they just got a western band wtf</br>   ebina <br><br>ŠPÜRDO ŚPÄRDE BÖRDO :DD WHERE ARE DA DAIHEI'S :D.

The series is named after her.</br>    <br> not watching it for the taihei onii-chan <br> not finding taihei cute <br> not fapping to incoming taihei porn <br> implying the show isn't secretly "Onanii-chan!

So english in anime is purposefully wrong.<br><br>This isn't always the case of course, but more often than not it is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, the uniform somehow manages to mask the fact that she eats like utter shit and doesn't suffer in any way for it. Not only that, but she's somehow amazing at sports, extracurricular and is a genuinely nice person outside of her home. Come on. This is wish fulfillment at its worst.</br>  <br> Were you also god tier at sports? <br><br>No. I was okay at running and table tennis and mediocre at everything else. <br>I don't know how you can be a slob and god at sports, unless it's shit that doesn't require you to move (like table tennis, an actual sports activity back where I studied).</br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't know how you can be a slob and god at sports <br>Which is why it's a shit trope.</br></br>  <br><br>I seriously think you are taking this too seriously. It's a comedy, an exaggerate Hotaru no hikari which is an already exaggerate reality, it's not reality.</br></br>  <br> you are taking this too seriously <br> you're not allowed to dislike tropes <br><br>Fuck off. It's obvious that it's a comedy, the premise is just unlikable for some.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm going to take it seriously and become livid at Umaru's bullshit and nothing you can do or say is going to stop me. <br><br>Deal with it.</br></br></br>  <br> Yes, the uniform somehow manages to mask the fact that she eats like utter shit and doesn't suffer in any way for it. <br><br>some kids can eat a lot of junk food and stay slim until their late teens<br>Umaru is what, 15? she'll probably go fat really fast in a few years</br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't it her last name?</br>  <br> it's a comedy <br>I'm not convinced.</br></br>  <br> Deal with it. <br>Make me.</br></br>  <br>Ebina is just a family name though. Her name is Nana.</br>  <br>It doesn't matter if they can stay slim.

"アニメ第二期から早３年。" <br><br>Someone please confirm that.<br><br> I want to believe </br></br></br></br></br>  Believing.  <br>Yes, that literally means 3 years since Season 2.</br>    <br>I was refering to<br> says something about a possible season 3? </br></br>  <br>That would be<br><br>はたして第三期はいつになるのか！？ <br><br>I guess?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> S3 of Horizon <br><br>As a Kawakamifag I really doubt there would be in the next 1000 years another season, why? because Sunrise is milking idolshit (LL movie and the enw project) and S8 staff is disarmed and split on different things.<br><br>So yeah S3 never and fuck you Sunrise/dengeki.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where is Js06? we need confirmation about this.</br>  <br>LL Sunshine has a long ways to go before it get's an anime series in the future. <br><br>Right now it's toss up for Mai-Hime continuation/new series or Horizon movie/season 3.<br><br>Since studio 8 wants to continue more originals, I'd say more Mai-HiME </br></br></br></br></br>  This was fucking glorious:<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/831116/3fb779<wbr>5a44/</wbr></br></br>  <br>Its going to hurt so bad when its nothing</br>  How much body oil do you go through when watching Horizon?  <br> Since studio 8 wants to continue more originals <br><br>Afaik S8 isn't even complete as the time when they made Horizon, or I'm wrong?</br></br></br>  Last volume scans where?  <br> Being this new <br><br>Those are already out, check the archive.</br></br></br>  <br>I would think Accel World is also up there. Didn't that also do pretty well for S8?</br>  <br>I think it was only around the 8k mark.</br>  <br>Accel World didn't do a good job, actually was average and nothing more.</br>  <br>What does that say exactly?</br>  how about that 3B epub  Still waiting for storyboardsanon  <br>God, I miss Tomo's breasts.</br>  Faggots we need to summon Js06 here, 2 years before he was summoned by Shinjou so that probably works.<br><br>POST SHINJOU</br></br>  <br>they did Buddy Complex,the sales failed miserably with 4k.The only successful originals Sunrise studio 8 can do well is Mai-Hime and LoveLive<br><br>If Sunrise do decide a Horizon 3rd season then they need much help on doing everything possible to succeed.</br></br></br>  <br>No anon,they are making idolshit and HiMEshit at the same time</br>  <br> successful originals <br> Mai-Hime <br><br>Do you have any guarantee that an anime that barely made over 10k, over 10 years ago is even worth investing in? How big is the Mai-Hime fanbase nowadays? I bet you anything it would sell less than 5k if Sunrise made a new season. Better to do something that's more recent like Horizon.</br></br></br></br>  Even as successful as Horizon was, wasn't it probably expensive to do? I'm only judging by looking at the seiyuu, but that's pretty much an all-star cast.  <br>I asked to a friend who works in Japan and he says that it doesn't look like an announcement, just something like "reviewing those programs also S3 when?. Koyasu as special guest"</br>  <br>It will take a while for Sunshine to get an anime, probably 2-3 years. Now that the movie is in theaters and there's no plans for any future LL anime it's time for S8 to do something new. Now that Gintama has been moved to Bamco, all that Sunrise has for 2016 is Mirai Arise (an original), Classicaloid (an original), and new Gundam (obviously an original) they'll probably do an adaptation anime and s8 will take it. Things are looking promising as this guy said <br>we have promotion on two fronts: festival screening and radio program and I believe there is something to look forward to.</br></br>  <br>The pre-production work was extensive too, but the Horizon anime was a success so there's no reason not to make season 3</br>  <br>DRRR! or Dog Days have a lot of top tier seiyuus and sold a lot, but not Horizon numbers</br>  <br>Probably. Seiyuu get paid more for seniority, so combined with all the big names, Sunrise probably paid bucketloads of money for all the voice acting talent.</br>  <br> reviewing those programs <br><br>My stance is why suddenly review radio programs from an anime that aired so long ago AND bring a guest seiyuu on board? I realize it's not an announcement per se but I still think it's somewhat significant. Obviously they won't announce s3, I realize that and everyone in this thread should too, but I hope there will be some kind of hint as to the future of the Horizon anime, or maybe a "look forward to this" kind of thing.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon you make me enter full Zetsubo sensei-mode with your post.</br>  <br>I wonder how much Koyasu even remembers about it. I remember hearing about how several seiyuu were fans of the LN, or became fans after they got the roles and started reading it. Was Koyasu one of them?</br>  Will any anon listen that program? Just to know if they say something related with an announcement.  You heard it first here:<br> It will be a Horizon pachinko. </br>  <br>You are thinking of EVA.<br><br>It will be a new special edition BD box set costing twice as much with some swag thrown in.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll stop believing if that happens.</br>  <br>Kawakami would somehow find a way to write a 500 page original story for it.</br>  <br>Yes,I believe Mai-Hime/Otome franchise would do great ten years later.Hell,If they keep the original cast to make a great continuation then it's gonna sell like close 10-11k in sales.Toy sales and other merchandise would sell hot cakes like LoveLive. If they make a ShizNat OVA series then it would sell 10k right off the bat.<br><br><br> It's time for S8 to do something new <br>The last time they did that it made a massive failure with Buddy Complex. Mai-HiME or other high school niche show could succeed well.</br></br></br></br></br>  So how has this not had an S3 yet? Does sunrise just hate money?  <br>On the contrary, they love it, that's why they're milking LL! and kidnapping Sunrise S8.</br>  <br>Not the best Japanese out there, but I guess it's something.<br><br> 7月12日放送　第193話　境界線上のホライゾン特集  <br> July 12th broadcast　193 episodes　Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere Report <br><br> アニメ第二期から早３年。はたして第三期はいつになるのか！？  <br>期待も込めて特集です。 <br> It's been three years since the anime's second season. Just when is the third season happening!? It's a report with hope put into it too. <br> もとちる一押しキャラは子安さん演じるシロジロです。  <br> Special guest character is Koyasu-san performer of Shirojiro. <br><br> 放送日7月12日(日)21:30～ （再放送7月13日(月)25:30～） <br> Broadcast day July 12th (Sunday) starting at 21:30　(Rebroadcast July 13 (Monday) starting at 25:30) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I guess we settle this once and for all <br><br>http://strawpoll.me/4870332</br></br>  <br>They love money that's why they are working with Mai-HiME and Love Live. I wouldn't say they are kidnapping them for more Gundam</br>  <br>Oriotorai adventures pre-Musashi residence</br>  <br>Let's see:<br>HiME,Horizon s3 and LoveLive<br><br>Can't we just have'em all</br></br></br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Why,we don't know what Sunrise is planning.LoveLive is out of the picture.It's a toss up for Horizon or Mai-HiME. <br><br>Studio 8 does love doing tons of character in long running series.</br></br></br>  <br>Nice, it's something and I'd like to see what comes out of it.</br>  apparently this link lets you listen to the radio for free, can anyone confirm if it's the right channel?<br><br>http://www.simulradio.info/asx/fmod<wbr>awara.asx</wbr></br></br>  Does anyone have a link to the Horizon 2ch thread? What are the nips saying about this radio show?  <br>I hope Koyasu uses his Shiro voice and just talks about the economic benefits of having a s3.</br>  Why would someone who isn't even a main character make such an important announcement? They would call Fukujun or Chihara Minori for something like S3.  <br><br/></br>  <br>So that means ITS FUCKING NOTHING S3 NEVER.</br>  <br> important announcement? <br> the announcement is FUCK YOU KAWAKAMIFAGS  <br><br>Since Shirojiro is a fucking cucklord who almost sold Musashi to the enemies is very accurate using his VA for this shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't even know what kind of a person Koyasu is so I don't even know if he would bother reading Horizon. It takes a lot of time and patience to truly appreciate it.</br>  <br>The only time they would announce s3 would be at the dengeki bunko fall festival. As of now we only know 3 stage events: DRRR, STB, and HO. DRRR has an anime airing now, STB has an OVA coming at the end of 2015, and HO has an anime in fall. There are still more events they have yet to announce so it's possible they could have a Horizon event which pretty much means s3. We just have to wait but I'm hopeful we'll be hearing something within the next 3 months.</br>   Le sunrise will gone forever after milking love live <br> you still believe s3 <br>Get over it Faggot. It wont happen</br></br>  <br>The radio broadcast is not a S3 announcement. But they are moving a lot around the series, so people is hoping this means they have something planned and some sort of announcement in the future.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wxH<wbr>2Z_asrxI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> Le <br><br>Go back to Reddit.</br></br></br>  <br> Le <br><br/></br></br>  <br>Don't know anon I really want to believe but it's been 3 fucking long years full of despair.</br>  <br>DRRR came after 5 years. I'll believe anything.</br>  <br>An announcement of an announcement? Japs love this kind of thing.</br>   Suddenly, an OnC adaption with Koyasu as Sayama is announced instead <br>How would you react?</br>  <br>Densetsu no Yusha no densetsu S2, something like that?</br>  <br>Happy, but vaguely disappointed since I liked Hirakawa Daisuke as Sayama in the drama CD.</br>  <br>I probably won't believe until a big announcement or confirmation, then masturbate 5 times until my balls hurts. After that when the anime comes out get screencaps of Shinjou and put that on a dakimakura and use it every night until the last drop of semen.</br>  <br>How about shifting Hirakawa to Dan instead?</br>  <br>what? I'm talking about Durarara season 2</br>  <br>So I basically use this link around 9:30 PM nip time to listen to the horizon program?</br>  <br>Yes.

This is worse than last week's.</br>  <br>His output the last few months has been pretty fucking on though. Minimal breaks.

I wonder if Green Bull will be a complete rookie or by-the-books veteran.</br></br></br></br>  <br>WATCH OUT TANJIHADO!</br>  <br>People have been pondering that since like 70-80 chapters ago</br>  <br>Fucking weeb.</br>  <br> mangastream <br> reliable </br></br>  <br> Raw <br> not Rō </br></br>  <br><br>Sabo</br></br>  <br>It helps to show that there are more people in the navy that don't agree with it's current state.</br>  <br><br>According to chink scans, which admittedly has way better translations than panda, what was actually said was<br><br> Akainu: Before you defeat "the Strawhat" and "Law", don't even think about coming back to any marine base !! <br> Fujitora: ....En, exactly how I wanted it!! <br> Akainu: !!? <br><br>It seems to imply that Fujitora might be leaving the marines too</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's a long time since we had a chapter with this bad translation.  Can someone just post the full raws?  <br>How incompetent must Akainu be, to recruit people straight into admiral rank just based on their power? Just a couple of years has passed and that shit backfired already.</br>  <br>It was given by one of cocrodile guys, i don't remember his number.<br>I thought it was more about logic, than inability. Like an object couldn't use a paramecia or a logia, but they could become animals.</br></br>  <br>ah fuck, what chapter is that?</br>  <br> insulting people who knows a language <br>Never change /a/.</br></br>  <br>They're at least accurate in meaning even if they take liberties with the phrasing.<br>Mangapanda is just nonsense</br></br>  <br>But how the fuck do you activate a Paramecia sword? By yelling at them? Doing a kata pose?  Haki? </br>   Kidd, Hawkins and Apoo VS Shanks <br>Who's ready for the desperate attempt to save him that will actually fail, but will result in the defeat of those 3?<br><br>also, Killer eating spaghetti through the mask made me chukle</br></br></br>  <br>Well yeah, but it's still better than this utter gibberish.</br>  <br>thanks for point 2 confirmation.</br>  <br>What good is a weak Admiral though? I'd imagine their strength is the #1 priority.</br>  <br> Depressing! <br><br>always gets me</br></br></br>  <br>Fuji going on to the Wano arc would be damn cool. Though he'd probably job to hype up Kaido's Crew.</br>  <br><br>Probably nepotism. He wanted people he could trust rather than just more dogs of the world nobles.</br></br>  <br>The fact is I don't understand it!</br>  <br>We already knew that since luffy first met burgess at the colusseum</br>  <br>They are also shit, but at least they use coherent sentences and appear to have at least read the work the are translating so they have some conext.</br>  <br>That's illegal.</br>  <br>they make it slang heavy but they at least get the message accross. panda cant even match google translates accuracy at this pointr</br>  <br>I believe it's supposed to be something like<br> Don't bother coming back here without Strawhat and Laws's heads. <br> That's fine by me <br>with Fujitora's response being intentionally ambiguous whether he's going to fight them or abandon the marines</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know really but I think it would be original to have a Paramecia in a sword wielded by an Admiral. <br><br> I saw someone saying that the scabbard might be in Kairouseki, and taking the sword out activated its power.  </br></br></br>  What the hell?!  <br>Saving who, Shanks? I think you should worry about those 3, not red-haired.</br>  <br><br>He should've just promoted the existing VAs, like it's been done before. You'd think that active marines are more trustworthy than just random fresh recruits.<br>Also, it's quite clear Fujitora doesn't trust Marines, or at the very least doesn't trust the Shichibukai program they're running.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh u</br>  <br> better translation <br> translator's notes <br> proper HD quality scans <br><br>fuck you</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd imagine he probably conscripted more than a few undercover revolutionaries. Fujitora might have been one of them.</br>  <br>Well now we know who the other three pirates are going after, Fuji is gonna quit, or fight Zoro. In any case we win.</br>  <br><br>This sounds plausible and believeable. Or maybe if fujitora indeed will go after luffy and law, he would probably let them escape and bullshit akainu a la garp</br></br>  <br><br>I don't think Fujitora was random. I think Sakazuki knows him.</br></br>  So, what the fuck are they doing right now?  <br>First and last time I'm spoonfeeding you</br>  <br>Well, it's a neat idea and a good simple engine. Would never think of it at least in some time.<br><br> Yes, I'm that dumb. </br></br></br>  <br>That would actually make more sense. If Fuji really wanted to capture Luffy/Law he would have done that a long time ago. Without the "gamble", and take care of Doffy himself to destroy the cage.</br>  can someone DDOS panda every wednesday/thursday till they improve this garbage effort. i might as well read raws at this point.  <br>The problem is, the VAs that are strong enough doesn't want the promotion (Garp) and the VAs that want the promotion aren't strong enough smoker and every other jobber Vice Admiral shown).</br>  <br>preparing to assassinate mingo</br>  <br>  desperate attempt to save him <br>Nah, it would probably go along something like shanks trashed those three but they managed to weakened him somehow and then blackbeard showed up, just like what he did on marineford war</br></br>  <br>Probably left Dressrosa a while ago.</br>  <br>I don't think Sakazuki would buy it.</br>  <br>Having a glass of moloko plus.</br>  <br>Fucking newfags taking mangapanda literally<br><br><br><br>Forgot the pic</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br> Trafalger D.

It takes a bit to keep and maintain that figure of hers.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks OP, I'll be sure to do so!<br><br>The laziest!

She has to be, to be a good King for her peerage. Wouldn't be right for the leader to just sit back and allow her subjects do everything.<br><br>How does your waifu prefer to celebrate holidays and other festive occasions? How would you like to celebrate with her?</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you, I wouldn't do anything else.<br>She stays pretty active since she has to keep up with her magic practice and everything it takes to be an Enforcer.</br></br>  <br>Hard to pick just one, and it would have to depend on the setting. That said, I could see myself as a bit of either a thief or swashbuckler class (I have a thing for speedsters for some reason), while she'd go the way of either ninja or dancer (due to her thing for flashy moves).<br><br><br>She usually likes to spend them with friends. Since we've gotten together, I've been playing host to her friendly gatherings.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Your waifu looks quite familiar. Who is she?</br>  Easy choice  <br>Fate Testarossa.</br>  <br>Mai is fit and physically active. Her athletic abilities are the second best among her circle of 6 friends.<br><br>Mai would be a lightly armored fighter; e.g. a Swashbuckler, since she's an agile swordswoman. (I guess I'd go with support caster.)<br><br>We don't really see Mai celebrate such occasions. I imagine that she'd like to do so surrounded by her friends.</br></br></br></br></br>  Is your waifu good at handling knives?  <br>Sonico can be a white mage, and I guess I'll be a swordsman. <br><br><br>She likes to dress up for special occasions. And we usually spend our holidays together. <br><br><br>I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure she can handle them fine.<br><br>What was the last piece of merchandise you bought of your waifu? I recently bought a daki, mousepad, and figma. <br><br> I've been cuddling with her 24/7 now. It's great. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Thanks, OP!<br><br>She's quite average. She doesn't like to get out and run where there are a lot of other people, but she's not opposed to exercise<br><br>I think she's be more of a support caster, since she's not one for direct confrontation. I think I'd be some kind of ranged fighter.<br><br>Well, she does like to cook, so I'd say yes.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127789166 <br> attention-whoring normalfag trying to fit in with "le waifu meme" <br>I don't need to hear that from you.</br></br>  <br>I feel like she's the one taking care of me sometimes.</br>  <br>She'd be best for either a magic-based class or something more all-around, to compensate for her superhuman strength, reflexes, etc.  I'd pick something magic-based too, probably similar to Red Mage. Supporting roles suit me better. <br><br><br>To answer my own question, she enjoys spending them with her loved ones. Friends, family, her peerage, enjoying the celebrations with them is how she'd prefer to do things. I'm alright celebrating however she'd like to, though I prefer smaller gatherings.<br><br><br>She's pretty dexterous but I don't think she has any particular aptitude for knives or other weapons like that.<br><br><br>I pre-ordered a cushion of her that should be coming mid this month. Might pre-order her newest figure too, still waiting to see how it looks with paint.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> normalfag </br>  <br>Active, but not particularly healthy as she, among the others in her group are ever shown eating right. It's pretty odd.<br><br>If I'm to believe promo art, openly fun and loud times with her friends, which is pretty much the same on my end, barring anniversaries.<br><br>There was this one time she used a shard of a plate as a knife, but I can't say for sure. Throwing knives I would give a solid yes to, though.<br><br>Daki cover and her elusive messenger bag are on the way, but I got  some elusive key chains and a few sketch commissions at AX. Going to fill a sketch book with sketches of her. It's nice to have a goal for future AXs. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably in a more understated manner with her friends. She's not a particularly festive person, but she still enjoys those occasions. <br><br>I can imagine player her a rather straight forward physical class like a lancer that can throw itself into the fray or something more offensive like a monk. I'd probably play a hybrid class like a shaman, I'm indecisive like that.<br><br>Somewhat.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>While she is a skilled professional swordswoman she has claimed being more confident in her magic based abilities, as such I picture her as a Spellsword with light armor and a focus on DPS.<br><br>As for myself, the delicate and precise art of magic doesn't appeal to me, instead heavy armor and large shields cater to my tastes.<br>Playing the role of Tank and soaking up damage to protect my beloved sounds a like a role I'd be happy to play.<br><br>When it comes to earthly festivities she has only heard stories for the most part.<br>When actually partaking in an earthly festivity she tends to get very excited and act upon all the stories she's heard like a little child.<br><br>She's a skilled practitioner of both hand to hand and sword based combat.<br>Give her a knife and I'm sure she'd use it well.<br><br>Another figure I bought a while ago.<br>Merch of her is rather outdated and incredibly rare at this point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now that there are some answers out, who would you hire for your rpg party?</br>  <br>Thank you! She is indeed very wonderful, I love her so much.<br><br>She is pretty active, seeing as how she does a lot of track and field, and even went to America for a little while for track stuff.<br><br>Judging by her agility and whatnot, I'd say she'd be some sort of thief/assassin class, but it'd be cute to see her as a mahou shoujo-esque spellcaster, and that'd suit her personality more.<br>I'd be a nature-based mage, preferably a healer.<br><br>She's never really shown celebrating the holidays, other than shopping around during Christmas times. <br>I assume she celebrates them like most teenage girls and spends time with her family and friends.<br><br>I pre-ordered a figure of her that'll be coming some time next month unless it gets delayed, and I bought her petanko figure last month.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Are there any foods you want to let your waifu try? I've always wondered if she'd like barbecue and stuff like that.  <br>In the thread or in general?</br>  <br>Thank you, I sure will. <br><br>Crona leads a fairly active life. He's not a track star or what have you, but he definitely keeps moving. Comes with the territory of being the Demon Swordsman, I suppose. <br><br><br>He could be a paladin, being a swordsman and all, and I'd opt to fill a supporting role. Whatever I can do to help him!<br><br><br>He usually gets together with his friends, but is sort of a wallflower. I don't blame him, it's understandable. <br><br>Depends on what holiday it is, I suppose. Celebrating at home is usually my defacto preference, and I think it's one he would share. I'd love to watch the ball drop on New Years while cuddling on the couch with him! I'd also like to watch 4th of July fireworks sitting on a hill somewhere by ourselves. <br><br><br>His sword, yes. He's pretty damn capable with it, I have to say.<br><br><br>The cards are the most recent pertaining mostly to him, I suppose. I bought the databook too, hopefully there'll be more art or whatever of him in it. But probably not, knowing how those things go.<br><br><br>There's a lot. He didn't exactly have a whole lot to choose from, growing up, so I'd like to make up for lost time and introduce him to a bunch. French toast and cinnamon rolls come to mind at the moment.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She'd fight with her sword, i'd probably pick a magic user.<br>She because she has experience with that, i because i'm not that strong. Also fun.<br><br><br>With her friends.<br>With our family.<br><br><br>Probably.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your waifu a cute too OP, and of course i will take care of my wonderful girl.<br>She must be between both, since she works on those games a lot, studying, and things like that.<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127786533 <br>Well, the tripfags around here aren't like the other threads and boards.<br> They're the best ones <br><br> You still can, anon. <br> I'm sure she will find you in the right time, so don't lose hope <br><br>I would pick the fighter or healer, and she would pick a wizard.<br><br>Either she invites her friends or we would be celebrating together, it depends of what is the day.<br><br>For fighting? I don't think so<br>But for cooking, she's good<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127789166 <br>Yours too!<br><br>I have never purchased anything related to her, but will buy the manga as soon as i have money.<br><br>Everyone?<br>Since some games you can have a big team.<br><br>Maybe some italian or german food, so she can try something new instead of the usual japanese food.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Based on the answers in the thread, since otherwise everyone would just take the ones with super powers.</br>  <br>Takao a super cute. Be a good husbando for her.</br>  <br>Your waifu a regular cute.</br>  <br>She can be a powerful air/wind mage due to her witch magic, and I'll be a stealthy rogue/assassin type as I'm rather good at remaining undetected.<br><br><br>By drinking and eating, both of which we do together!<br><br><br>Nope, Erica is a gun and magic user.<br><br><br>Just the daki, ages ago. More stuff to come in the future.<br><br><br>Bhut Jolokia hotsauce. I love the stuff.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How big can the party be? <br><br><br>I'll probably let her try ribs and steak.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rude. Everyone's waifu a super cute. <br>  </br></br>  <br>We could have a nice mage/archer combo. She can use her ridiculous archery skills and I'll be an ice mage, make targets easy to shatter and slow them from running out of range.<br><br><br>She prefers small get-togethers with her "family". <br>Just sitting up on a roof watching fireworks with her would be wonderful.<br><br><br>I have a hard time finding merch of her, I did find a daki but it was 250$<br> I'll probably buy it in a year though. <br><br><br>She can try anything she wants, though I would prefer if it was something mild. There has to be some way to get her away from spices.<br><br>Post the most recent image you've saved of you're waifu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You should tell everyone to post their waifu in a swimsuit next just to make sure you flood the thread with images ASAP</br>  You are walking around town with your waifu after dinner, holding hands on a winter night, absentmindedly talking with her. After a while she gets a bit quiet. You're about to ask her what's wrong, but then notice  you accidentally walked her right into the love hotel district, and there's nothing but love hotels on all sides. <br>Idiot!<br><br>As you frantically explain that this wasn't intentional, your waifu is completely flustered and is staring silently at the ground.<br><br>What do you do?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Uhm, 8, but you can only have 4 active members at any given time?</br>  If you love your waifu this much, you could sculpt a scale 1:1' statue of her, for fuck's sake  <br> That's one pointy nipple there </br>  <br>She doesn't have any.<br><br>Whatever she wants, really. Something exotic and not exactly normal.<br/></br></br></br>  <br>She's pretty active.<br><br><br>I'd be a tank to protect her. Warrior specifically. She'd probably be a plate dps class.<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127789166 <br>Thanks loser.<br><br><br>She's more of a boxcutter lass herself, but she does great work with it.<br><br><br>Something that I've made myself, honestly.<br><br><br>Alter figure.<br><br>If you're waifu was the type to shitpost, how good do you think she'd be at it? How many replies do you think she would get on average?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone that can fill the role for physical damage well, maybe a damage tank to cover for us both so we can stay out of range.<br><br><br>I'm not sure. There's no shortage of a variety of foods for her to try in the city so if she ever wanted something in particular I'm sure we could find a place that has it.<br><br><br>She wouldn't be so embarrassed about something like that. If anything she'd tease me about taking her to such a place.  We'd stay for a while. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127791270 <br>Woah, what are you talking about? No need for hostilities, here.</br>  <br>Too good. I get the feeling I should be careful in case she decides to get a little stabby.<br><br>I'm in dire need of something new. The most recent thing I have of her is the pre-order of that Project Mirai game.<br><br>Wouldn't mind cooking some italian for her, though she isn't particularly fond of messy foods.<br><br>Fair enough.<br><br>Keep walking. It was obviously a lapse of judgement.  Though depending on how flustered, I could always risk seeing what happens if we go inside... <br><br>I doubt she'd get that many. Depends on how strongly people react to racial slurs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127791368 <br>I honestly have no idea what you're talking about.</br>  Holy shit look al all that cancer.  <br>She's active but like everyone, she likes to be lazy some times.<br><br>Yuno a cute! I finished Hidamari Sketch yesterday, it was awesome but not long enough. Guess I'll have to stick with the manga.<br><br>She would be either a warrior or a leader. Something that has to do with protecting what she loves.<br>As forme, I wouldmost likely be a leader.<br><br>She normally spends the time with her friends, either staying chilling at home or going out to fun places. I wouldn't chance much of it when we celebrate. Of course, I would get her gifts.<br><br>No, since she hasn't tried, but I'm sure she would if she trained.<br><br>A 1/8 Yukata figure of her.<br><br>Italian food and my  cooking <br><br>Roger!<br><br>"So, shall we keep walking. It's getting late and we probably should be home soon." Without losing my cool.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I imagine she'd be pretty good at it. As for how many replies, I really don't have a good idea.</br>  <br>Definitely healthy and active! All that fighting will definitely burn some calories.<br><br><br>I'd have a feeling Erza would be the tank class since she usually wields swords and because she likes to dive right into battle, whilst I would probably be a mage/healer simply so I can buff her up when needed, (and also stay out of her way.)<br><br><br>She would most likely celebrate her holidays by partying with her guild members, which would probably end up getting half the town destroyed again. I don't mind how I celebrate with her as long as I get to spend some time with her.<br><br><br>Well swords are kind of like big knives, so I will say yes.<br><br><br>Bought a limited edition figurine of her two weeks ago. I just need to buy a case for it now.<br><br><br>Everyone here.<br><br><br>I would like to let her try some of my homemade cooking. Hopefully she will like it.<br><br><br>Tell her if she's scared she can close her eyes and take my hand. I will then lead her out of there safe and unharmed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I will anon, i'm doing my best to be a great husbando for her.<br><br>Pic related<br><br>Oh damn.<br> That's a bit difficult to answer, since i don't know if she is blushing or not  But if she does, i will ask her if she wants to go, and if she says yes, then we would get the most expensive one and make lots of love. <br><br>Well, in modern days, some got the skills to draw her, or make a song for her.<br>And it doesn't matter what form it is, as soon you make something for her with love, it's still good.<br><br>She would shitpost on /v/ or /g/, in both she might get ~50 replies and then get a b&amp;.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> leader class <br><br>You lost me.</br></br></br>  <br>Take charge like a man and bring her to one without asking her if she wants to. Girls love men who take charge.</br>  <br> some got the skills to draw her <br>I mean't that some can draw THEIR waifu, not mine.<br> Sorry </br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I would explain to her that I didn't mean for us to come here. She would be confused at first and then she'll understand it wasn't intentional. <br> Then I'll ask her if she wants to go inside. <br><br><br>I can't imagine her shitposting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, the food i cook for her.<br><br><br> implying it wasn't intentional </br></br></br></br>  <br>Miyako looks to be an expert archer.<br>Mai would serve as a quick close quarters combatant.<br>Rias has an arsenal of powerful magic abilties.<br>Rukia herself makes this a powerful party of 4.<br><br>It's a shame she hasn't experienced many different foods, as such I don't have a single food in mind, I'd like her to try all sorts of things.<br>Thought I suspect she's a got a sweet tooth.<br><br>This one.<br>She looks great in arabian clothing.<br><br>I tease her, saying something along the lines of "Whaat?~ Haven't you ever seen a place like this before? Don't these places exist in the soul society?"<br>The scene would promptly end with me getting a boot to the head.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn powergamer.</br>  No image because I'm  at work <br><br>A bit of both. She needs to stay fit to battle witches and maintain her slim figure considering how much she eats, but she makes up for it by slacking off in equal measures. Her lazy side is very cute.<br><br>She'd be a lancer of course! I'd most likely support her as an archer or mage.<br><br>She'd probably hang out with her friends, doubtlessly at Mami's house with a huge cake to celebrate. I'm sure she'd take any excuse to eat Mami's cooking anyway. The two of us can celebrate  lewdly <br><br>The yukata scale fig from Aniplex. Very excited to recieve it. damn that shit's expensive though.<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127789166 <br>&lt;3<br><br>Can I say everything?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Say something nice about a waifu you normally don't notice!  <br>My own answer would be<br><br>Nepgear has both healing and buffing powers, along side being pretty durable and strong, so she'd fit the Paladin role really well.<br>I'm somewhat durable, with enough stamina to wear some heavier armor and weapon, I'd probably fit right in to the Warrior/Paladin role too, but I would probably be a tank.<br><br><br>Seems to enjoy them with her friends and family. I don't celebrate anything, but I'd probably do it with her to make her happy.<br><br><br>Somewhat good with it.<br><br><br>Last thing I bought was a daki cover of the commission I had bought a while ago. It's on its way.<br><br><br>Depends on party sizes, but if it's for say dungeons, some damage dealers and maybe a healer.<br><br><br>Maybe some Thai food.<br><br><br>This was one of them.<br><br><br>It depends. If it's the nonlewd option, I'd take a bit more serious tone and say it was not intentional, then I'd hold her a bit closer and tell her we'll go home.<br>If not  see if I can maybe get her to be okay with going to one then take her to one, feel hearts racing, watch something on a TV being really close together in just underwear, getting lewder by the minutes, then when we can't take it anymore, sex her all night hard rough love pounding  safe </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  My waifu is the cutest! I love her and I want to always stay by her side! She is MY hero!  <br> 3496x2484 <br><br>Shit.</br></br></br>  <br> not being a hero for you're waifu </br>  <br>She is that kind of person who gets stuff done.<br><br><br>Usually i would go with tech/magic stuff but she would fit that role more. <br><br><br>Normal like everyone else i guess. And i would like to do that as well. No need for extraordinary things.<br><br><br>She is combat trained.<br><br><br>A mousepad.<br><br><br>Whoever doesn't quit after 5 minutes.<br><br><br>Stuff that i eat on weekly base. Otherwise? No idea.<br><br><br>Alright.<br><br><br>Tell her that it was a mistake and that home is a better place for that kind of stuff.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Is you're waifu a more healthy and active person, or a more lazy person? <br>I say she's pretty healthy.<br><br> If you and you're waifu were to go on a fantasy, sci-fi adventure or something such as that along different realms and worlds, what classes would you and you're be? Why would you both pick those classes? <br>That depends on many factors such as setting and classes. Whatever works best for her and me I guess.<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127789166 <br>Thank you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You come home one day to find your waifu  bent over, stuck in that window looking over your backyard that can't really be seen from outside. She says it closed on her while she was leaning out, and asks for your assistance. <br>What course of action do you take?</br>  <br>First, I'd wonder how she got stuck in a sideways-opening window...</br>  <br>Hate to be a killjoy, but I get her unstuck. Unless she makes a point of being stuck in the window. As long as it's consensual in the end, really.</br>  <br>Erza is a strong beauty that has a really cute side to her.  Long red hair is perfection. <br><br><br>I can't even draw, let alone sculpt. I'd be scared of what the end result would look like if I made an attempt. Maybe someday.<br><br><br>I  help her out the window since it's probably highly uncomfortable to be stuck like that, and embarrassing.   But grab her butt while helping her, because why not? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Post the most recent image you've saved of you're waifu. <br>Here is mine.<br><br>"This was an accident."</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a really huge image indeed.<br><br><br>Well, wonder how that'd happen.<br>I'd probably  accidentally make a lewd move, but help her out. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I want to be the most beautiful person for her. A heart that glimmers with kindness and joy.</br></br>  <br><br>She  gets sulky and says she was only pretending to be stuck in the hope that you'd do lewd stuff to her.<br>Bad end.</br> </br></br>  <br>Of course. Just my luck.</br>  You find your waifu watching cute animal videos at 3 a.m., what do you do?  <br> If you're waifu was the type to shitpost, how good do you think she'd be at it? How many replies do you think she would get on average? <br>I don't think she'd be successful unless she learns how to Carnac post. <br> hfw I catch her in the act of Carnac posting after several minutes of her doing that to me <br><br>Ask how she got stuck, then get her unstuck while applying oil if needed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A little bit of both, I'd say. Considering she'll spend most of her time either reading in peace or angrily chase her sisters around.<br><br><br>Blanc would probably be a paladin-like class (pic-related) that smashes enemies with her hammer. <br><br>Does your waifu also have friends? Would you also  befriend  them as well?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most recent image that I saved. Thank you to Audere once again for drawing her.<br><br><br>Kuroko is pretty cute. She makes me laugh in Railgun.<br><br><br>Tickle her feet, before helping her back in.<br><br><br>T-thanks dude!  Red hair masterrace. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm her hero. I'll always be there for her and protect her. <br><br><br>I would, but I can't sculpt for shit. <br><br><br> Take advantage of the situation, then later help her. <br><br><br>Watch some with her, because why not? <br><br><br>Yes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I love her beutiful lips and waist. <br><br><br> not doing a hero duo <br><br> Doing something lewd first    Like grabbing her legs slowly, then her ass, and lastly get her out of the window. <br> And of course, she will give me a slap for doing that <br><br> I'm sure you already are, anon. <br><br>Watch 'em with her.<br><br>She got her original game creation club and the "fake" one, i'm sure i can befriend them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Keep walking. I'd probably be flustered too.<br><br>Help her out. Maybe tease her about it too.<br><br>She has one friend, Lilly. I'm sure I could befriend her as well.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hug her from behind, then watch them with her.<br><br>She has her share of friends. If anything, I owe them for introducing me to her.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks OP, I will! Hibiki is a very active person and has been known to run in multiple marathons!<br><br>I want to drink Hibiki Suntory Whiskey with Hibiki! Also, nice trips!<br><br>I don't know enough about that stuff to even know what the classes would be!<br><br>She'd just jump right in! Experiencing new things has always been exciting to her! I'd like to celebrate it with all her friends!<br><br>Kitchen knives, if that counts!<br> pic related <br><br>I bought a patch of her for my PC!<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127789166 <br>Thanks and nice dubs!<br><br>I want to make her try some Del Mar Fair food!<br><br>Bite the bullet, cover her face, and make a bee-line out of there as fast as and as inconspicuous as possible. It would ruin her career as an idol if she were snapped by a tabloid in the love-hotel district.<br><br>That red-haired girl from Madoka Magica has a nice character design. It seems pretty familiar though, I wonder why?<br><br>Lightly tease her  by putting my hips and groin next to her soft bosom in a simulated standing doggy style while making a cheeky remark about skipping the dinner and the bath and getting straight to dessert. Then once I have my fill of teasing her , i'd help her out, give her a kiss and ask her how her day was.<br><br>Hell yeah motherfucker, i'd love to be friends with Takane and the rest of 765! Even more, i'd like to work there as an assistant/escort/security/etc.<br><br>Would you make dinner for your waifu or would she be the one making dinner?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Watch them with her. <br><br> Does your waifu also have friends? Would you also befriend them as well? <br>Yes and yes. I'm sure I can do that. Mako shouldn't be that hard to make friends with.</br></br></br></br>  Nico is healthy and active. She needs to keep up her idol figure.  <br>Ritsuko says hi!</br>  <br>Nico would be a dancer because obvious reasons. I'd probably just be a simple fighter or thief because its what I choose in my vidya games.</br>  <br>If she was ever stuck for more than a few seconds in so much as a cookie jar, I would ask if she's pretending to be stupid.<br><br>She has a small group. They're good people, so I wouldn't mind befriending them.</br></br></br>  I just had a nice dream about her last week. I was driving a black BMW X5 in the Alps heading towards a ski resort, where we rented a hut, where we wuld spend a week togerher. One of the most happiest dreams in my life. Last thing I remember that we cuddled before the firepalace under a blanket after arriving and planning where we would go skiing the next day.<br><br><br>What kind of music would your waifu listen to? Would you two be compatible?</br></br></br>  <br>Tease her for awhile, questioning how somebody as delicate and precise as her managed to get stuck in such a clumsy position. Then I suppose I'll help her out.<br><br>That honestly sounds like something she would do.<br>If she's enjoying herself, I'm not going to interfere.<br><br>Yes, The Karakura group are a colorful, friendly bunch. I'd befriend them, sure.<br><br>I doubt either of us are the most experienced cooks.<br>Instead we enjoy cooking together.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Last piece of merchandise that was released was a nendo I think, but I have my daki and nendo petits too.</br>  <br>Poor Nico and her lower quality...</br>  <br>I'd love to cook for her. I only really know how to make vegetarian dishes, which I doubt she's had much of, so that'd be something for her to try.<br><br>Alright. I still have no idea who the girl in the middle is, maybe Manami? It's not tagged as her, or anybody.<br><br>Prepare myself for a storm of angry, tsundere fists for being such a baka hentai and then try my best to explain the situation to her.<br><br>Watch them with her, duh.<br>I want to watch nekonabe videos with my cute waifu!<br><br>She has two circles of friends, and I'd try my best to befriend them.<br>I'd probably fit in better with her otaku circle of friends, but I'd still join in on shopping trips with her model friends and be nice to them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Thank you, OP!<br><br>My husbando is very active. He loves the thrill of the fight, and all of his hobbies involve training to get stronger. I always do yoga in the mornings with my husbando and go for a jog with him to enjoy the scenic views around my house together, not to mention sparring!<br><br><br><br>He'd probably be some kind of magic barbarian and I'd be a martial artist. I've often imagined us being side-characters in a shonen manga who travel some fantasy world together looking for new opponents.  I want to sleep naked with my husbando in a tent under the stars in the driven snow, wrapped up together with furs... <br><br><br><br>He typically doesn't care for human holidays and it's not like he's able to celebrate his own culture's holidays. I tend to offer him a no-strings-attached date and meal during holidays just to keep things casual, it's only on special holidays like christmas where I'd ask him for anything more.<br><br><br><br>Well he's got two knives in his chest, so I'd say he's either very masterful with knives or very poor.<br><br><br><br> A doujin. I'm a little too shy to read it...! <br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127789166 <br><br>Well thank you! <br><br>Yui is a lovely girl, Anon. You must be very happy together.<br><br><br><br>Anyone who's a healer. The healer class is one that speaks kindness and tenderness, but it's also very tough when you get down to the technicalities and what not. I could see a lot of anons and waifus here taking up the class, hence why I'm not naming any names.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  My Senjougahara is very healthy and active, but can be lazy at times  <br><br> facebook <br>Go back, please.</br></br></br>  <br>Mai waifu is very fragile, if she over-exerts, she explodes and falls apart.</br>  <br>That'd be this one. Cute!<br><br><br>Perfect opportunity for some teasing and butt-slaps.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Watch and laugh along with her of course!<br><br><br>Hell yeah, everyone in her guild is super friendly, and they seem like a blast to be around.<br><br><br>Oh definitely her, I have zero cooking skills and Erza is a great chef. I would love to eat her cooking every day.<br><br><br>She hasn't shown any tastes in music yet from what I know, but I'm sure whatever they are, I will love them as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Anon <br> tripwhore begging for attention everywhere he can </br></br>  <br><br>Ge-ge a  qt__ !<br><br><br>Both of us, probably.  And possibly with the help of Rom and Ram as well. <br><br><br>Classical/Orchestra music from  Lowee </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But we can do things like that inside!<br><br><br>Watch a few with her but that's not really my thing. <br><br><br>She's got quite a few of them. They're all good people, I'm sure I'd get along with them.<br><br><br>I enjoy cooking a lot and I'd like to believe I'm good at it. I'll gladly take care of all the cooking stuff, but cooking together with her sounds really nice too and I'm sure whatever we made would taste delicious.<br><br><br>Sadly it's never elaborated on whether or not she likes music and, if she does, the type she enjoys the most.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It would switch. One night she would make something for me, and the next night I'll make something for her and so on. <br><br><br>She probably listens to pop and rock music. We both like rock music so that's good.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Would you make dinner for your waifu or would she be the one making dinner? <br>I'm not good at cooking but I can try for her every now and then.</br></br>  <br>Watch it with her, I sometimes end up doing that.<br><br><br>Blanc is a real qt.<br><br>She's a good group of friends.<br><br>Though I would not want to be friends with any of them.<br><br><br>We'd take turns I'd imagine, or both of us cooking at the same time. Seems like a fun thing to do, and cooking in general is fun. I'd love to cook for her every day.<br><br><br>Can't recall her having any specifics, but I think she'd enjoy pop mostly, but be open to a lot.<br>I like a lot of rock, so maybe.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  why are TM waifus so god tier  <br> we can do things like that inside! <br>And where's the fun in that?</br></br>  <br>We would take turns, though clearly one would take the initiative if it was to surprise the other.<br><br>She's more into trance, Latin, and Jazz. I'm afraid our tastes in music clash, but there's something to be learned from having an interest in different genres, especially when both have a thing for good music in general.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Help her get unstuck. Only after teasing her a bit.<br><br><br>Watch a few more with her, then tell her to get back in bed with me.<br><br><br>She does. I wouldn't be able to become friends with all of them but i would at least not have problems with them.<br><br><br>I would.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Well thank you!  <br><br> Yui is a lovely girl, Jebus. Go become a prostitute for sasquatches and die being known as the first to get sasquatch AIDS, you cancer-ridden faggot. <br><br>I dunno, Anon. That doesn't have as nice a ring to it. Maybe I should stick to being polite.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A little bit of both.<br><br><br>No idea. I can be pretty open as well as pretty critical in regards to my musical tastes.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Did she survive the Godzilla onslaught? </br>  I can only assume healthy and active. Must be, considering her line of work.  How long is your waifu's skirt?  <br>Probably on "slut."<br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>    <br>moot?<br> 127794737 <br>About halfway between proper and flirty<br><br>Now take your 3DPD shit out of here</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have more cooking experience than she does so I would be the one cooking most of the meals.<br>We'd probably switch it up every so often, though.<br><br>Lots of j-pop and denpa/moe-pop stuff.<br>She probably listens to a lot of songs from eroge openings, I can see this being one of her most listened to songs https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Cys<wbr>YjbJuMIg</wbr>  [ ] (warning for lewd)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Both, sometimes i will cook for her, or she will cook for me.<br>But if it's a special occasion i will cook for her, so she won't get tired.<br><br>She would listed to the OST of her favorite games, or some instrumental music too.<br>We would be compatible with the OSTs, but i love other genres that she might not like, but we would be listening to some tracks together, along with some hugs and drinking tea.<br><br>Pic almost looked like scars.<br> Scary <br>Proper length when we go out, and flirty when we make love.<br>And don't post 3D here anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>my waifu only wears a shirt anon</br>  <br><br>I can imagine her being pretty lazy Yomiko's not exactly the athletic type.<br><br><br><br>Yomiko would be an archer using her paper as arrows or maybe a spell caster, no idea which class I would pick. Maybe a caster too since I've never been that big on melee.<br><br><br><br>Snuggling together and enjoying a good book as always of course.<br><br><br><br>No idea, she can slice them in half with her paper skills though.<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127789166 <br><br>Yui is a beautiful and energetic girl<br><br><br><br>I'd love to cook her a paella <br><br><br><br>Love hotels aren't really my style, we'd try and get out there then go back home for some loving.<br><br><br><br>Get her unstuck though somehow I think we'll end up stuck together but I'd make sure not to let that happen.<br><br><br><br>Grab some tea and just relax with her watching until I fall back asleep or we're sleeping comfortably together.<br><br><br><br>I'd befriend Nene, I like how ballsy she is and The Papers seem like a really cool bunch, I'm not as big as a fan of Hemingway as Maggie is but I've got a few of his novels. Discussing them with her would be cool but I think they'd like manga more than Yomiko.<br><br><br><br>Shared responsibility but I would be the one doing it most of the time.<br><br><br><br>She's a fan of Beethoven according to the OVA<br><br>What was the last thing you dreamed about of your waifu? My most recent one is where we're in bed together preparing to sleep then I dig out a giant book of Shakespeare sonnets and read Yomiko a couple while she's holding onto me until she's fast asleep. After that I put the book back on the nightstand, pat her head then kiss her, switch off the light then cuddle her too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She would. She likes to cook, after all, and I'd love to eat her creations.<br><br>It isn't said what she might like, but probably something relaxing/soothing, although that varies from person to person.<br><br>Well, she doesn't like showing much skin, but it's usually a normal length with stockings to cover her skin.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think somewhere between cheeky and flirty.</br>  Super active.<br>She works out non-stop.<br>Well, she stops, because overtraining is a no-no, but being a warrior being healthy and active is a major part on her life.<br><br><br>I'd be an archer and she'd be a warrior I suppose.<br>I could get into bows and stuff, and she already is a warrior.<br><br>I suppose she'd have to carry for me, at first.<br><br><br>She doesn't celebrate anything at all, as far as I know.<br><br><br>She handles two in her every day life.<br><br><br>The OS figure.<br>I'd love to buy the combat cards and stuff.<br>I really should.<br><br><br>o-okay<br><br><br>TAKE THE WAIFU  home. <br> And make love there. <br><br><br> Kiss her buttcheeks and girly place and then  help her get unstuck.<br><br>Still, I'd have to ask how on Earth did she, of all people, get stuck there.<br><br><br>Depends whether the following day is a week day or not.<br><br><br>She had one.<br>They don't meet much anymore, however.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, she is.<br><br><br>Going with Conquer classes because I don't know a lot about other games that have them. Ninja-&gt;Warrior-&gt;Fire taoist for me, I think pure Trojan for her, but I could also see her going with pure Ninja or the same rebirth path as me. For both of us, it'd need to be something that makes at least some sense in a competitive PvP setting, and a class with high damage output.<br><br><br>A bootleg daki cover.<br><br><br>Salmiakki.<br><br><br> As you frantically explain that this wasn't intentional <br>I wouldn't do that. I'd pretend that it was my intention to go there all along.<br><br><br>About Akari?<br><br><br>Ask her if she wants company.<br><br><br>Yes, yes.<br><br><br>Well, only one of us has a physical body in the 3D world so it has to be me. She's better at it than I am, though. I would make tea for her even if we weren't restricted by our difference in the number of dimensions.<br><br><br>Mostly rock, but other genres are fine too as long as the music is rhythmical. I probably listen to extreme metal and EDM more than other genres, but I'm very interested in a lot of different genres and I love all kinds of music as long as it's good, which means that our tastes in music overlap very much in practice.<br><br><br>Between flirty and cheeky.<br><br><br>The last dream I remember was the one where I saved her and an unknown friend of hers by sawing off the head of a mad scientist who was trying to perform a dangerous brain experiment on them against their will. Pretty sure I had another one after that, but I don't remember what happened in it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think I find this scale appropriate.</br>  <br> above the knee is flirty <br><br>Hey grandpa.</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you OP.<br><br>Yup, Miku is really active and healthy.<br><br><br>I'd probably be an average class or something along the lines of a shield bearer. Miku would most likely use magic or healing spells.<br><br><br>Most likely spending time with a well sized group of friends.<br><br>I don't really like spending time with a lot of people, but I'd make an exception for Miku.<br><br><br>I don't think she could do any amazing tricks with a knife, but she wouldn't be clumsy enough to cut herself.<br><br><br>Two snow Miku plushies.<br><br><br>Not really. What I'd really like is to try her cooking and dishes instead. There's nothing really special about the typical murican food I eat.<br><br><br>Alright.<br><br><br>I'd just laugh and tell her that I didn't even notice the hotels. I'd hold her close, caress her, give her a small kiss and continue walking home.  Where we would vent our lewd thoughts togheher under the warmth of our blankets. <br><br><br>It's driving me into despair.<br><br><br>I'd help her get out. I wouldn't want to embarrass her. Miku wouldn't be able to stop blushing and letting moans slip out if I did, and it'd devastate her if the neighbors saw her in that situation.<br><br><br>Cuddle and watch together. Make some tea/hot cocoa for her.<br><br><br>Yup. Luka, Rin, and her many other Vocaloid friends. Although she'd mainly hang out with Rin and Luka. I'm sure we'd get along.<br><br><br>I just listen to random genres and whatever sounds good. I'm pretty sure Miku could recommend me some good music.<br><br><br>It varies in length in artwork, concert holograms, etc. But it's usually kinda of short and above her thigh highs. Very cute.<br><br><br>In your opinion, what is your waifu the queen of?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Everything! I get a heart boner when I see cute baras enjoying my food, and of course my husbando is the cutest bara of all. On top of that, my husbando probably hasn't tried many human foods. I want to make him big, fluffy pancakes in the mornings. I want to make him big barbecue ribs and the both of us get barbecue sauce everywhere while we're eating them. I want to eat tasty pork buns and boiled eggs with him for lunch. I even want to make a big pot of potato soup in the winters and eat fresh-baked christmas cookies together in the winter!<br><br><br><br>I saved a lot of images recently. This one, I think?  I want to be childhood friends with my husbando! <br><br><br><br>To break the awkwardness, I state that it's super chilly out here and that it must be his fault for dawdling.  Then while he's got his guard down and trying to work out why I'm suddenly so displeased with him, I lean myself up toward him, whisper for him to "Take responsibility and go warm me up", and finish with a little tug on his earlobe with my lips. <br><br>There! Situation resolved.<br><br><br><br>I could also rent a room in an art studio, cover the floor in paper, strip naked, cover my body in paint, and do a massive portrait of him.<br><br>I'm really busy though, so I guess I'm not.<br><br><br><br>Decent, I'd suppose? I mean he'd probably be shitposting on /fit/ and that's just easymodo.<br><br><br><br>Sonicobro wasn't here the last time around, so I'll say that Sonico looks very comfy and huggable!<br><br><br><br>Can't he just phase through the wall? What a baka. I sit on his butt as punishment.<br><br><br><br>Show him the video of the squeaky moth.<br><br><br><br>He doesn't really have many friends, and I can't say I enjoy hanging out with prison scum. I'd probably enjoy chilling with Joseph, though!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She survived it pretty well, though now I'm tempted to give her some exposure to the Heisei era.  <br><br><br>It's been a long time since the last one. For some reason she was cosplaying as an extremely touchy and affectionate Talia Al Ghul.<br><br><br>She is the Queen. She is A-Number One.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the laziest<br><br><br>I'd be a hunter, always am in muh vidya. Mako would probably make a good rogue-ish class too.<br><br><br>doesn't have any reason to be, so no<br><br><br>daki. gonna buy a fig soon though<br><br><br>try (and fail) to play it cool and turn right around. <br><br><br>tease her while I help her out. <br><br><br>recommend some of the ones I've seen. Saw a great documentary about bees once. <br><br><br>yes, and yes some of them. <br><br><br>we'd take turns. Both lazy. <br><br><br>she hasn't shown a preference, but I like pretty much anything so it'd be fine<br><br><br>about average anime length i guess? not too lewd</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Showa her to your own monster. </br>  <br>Flirty and above <br><br><br>I can't remember  We probably did something lewd. </br></br></br></br>  <br> What was the last thing you dreamed about of your waifu?  <br>It was the 1950s and we were married.</br></br>  <br>Forgot my picture.</br>  <br>I was singing "Vivo por ella" to her.<br>I guess i was thinking that i could sing like him one day, so two of the things i love got mixed in that dream.<br><br> I would seriously love to sing "Vivo por ella" with her, but the the closest thing would be making her seiyuu sing with me, but for now i have to sing alone. <br><br>Queen of  my heart. <br><br>Anyway, i have to go now, have a nice evening with your waifu.<br> Hoping you all see the sunset with your waifu. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>According to my calculations joining forces with a ranged character like Miyako would likely result in the highest amount of mutual benefits.<br><br>I'd like to see her try köttbullar or some of our various sausage variants.<br><br>I guess it's not the most favorable depiction of her.<br><br>It'd depend on how lucky I feel, but in most cases I'd try my best to keep walking after a long and awkward moment of silence with her. It's not like we're dependent on it.<br><br>She's far more likely to be the type to feed trolls with her hotblooded earnestness.<br><br>Ritsu is best K-On!<br><br> beat me to it, darn.<br><br><br>Don't bother her, it's the best time to visit the nice corner of the Internet. She'd be too embarrassed if I were to intervene, I'd rather tease her about it in the following morning.<br><br>I'd certainly love too, I really like Anzu's laid-back nature and Yuzu playful teasing of Momo.<br><br>She has more experience, but I'd gladly assist her.<br><br>Provocative. the show's character designers are quite fond of short skirts.<br><br>I dreamed about her being in charge of a mountain town that was pivotal in the war between humanity and necromancers that happen to be giants that ride dragons inhabiting the mountain.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's hard to tell but I think it borders between cheeky and flirty, which is perfect for Erza.<br><br><br>I have this one dream that we're out punting along one of the rivers in Fiore. It's night time and she's sitting down gazing at the stars whilst I push the boat along gently. Eventually we settle down in a nice quiet spot and I take a seat next to her. As we both look up at the night sky, she rests her head upon my shoulders. After a while I  propose to her. <br><br><br>Well since she has the nickname Titania, I guess she is the queen of the fairies</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't really like the way they're described.<br>But It's around the "cheeky" spot, I guess.<br><br><br>I know I dreamed of her last night or the one before, but I can't remember what it was. I know I saw her face.<br><br><br>My heart.<br>I don't really know.<br><br> I'm just gonna sleep now because my eyes hurts too much. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  My waifu is a fucking angel.<br><br>An angel, damn it.</br></br>  <br>A walk in the countryside upstate was the last dream I had of her. We  held hands .<br><br><br>My heart. She could be queen of the whole world if she wanted.<br><br><br>Good night, Takaobro.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'd usually cook because I enjoy cooking. I definitely wouldn't mind him cooking something for me or helping me out, though. In fact, a dinner made by the whole family seems pretty fun and rewarding!<br><br><br><br>I dunno. Knowing Araki, probably some kind of cool rock-and-roll music or dad rock. I mean, I enjoy heavy metal, italo-disco, and synthwave, so I'm sure we're compatible enough.<br><br><br><br>Considering how old-fashioned that graphic seems, he's "By gods, a savage! Fetch my elephant gun!" length.<br><br><br><br>I can't remember. It's depressing because my medication is supposed to give me vivid dreams. Where are my hard-earned husbando dreams, huh?<br><br><br><br>My husbando is the king of honorable battles!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Dream <br>Hah, I wouldn't call them dreams, the only memories I retain from my sleep are frequently negative, consisting of death.<br><br>I'm cradling her in my arms while she whispers to me in a weak, hushed tone, telling me she has no regrets, that she lived a good life and that she was truly happy to have met me, before telling me to be strong and live a long happy life as she dies in my arms.<br><br>I'm convinced this has come about from my unending anxiety and paranoia surrounding Rukia's possible death in the future of Bleach's manga.<br><br> Apologies for the morbid post, there is supposed to be a happy, light air to these threads. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you're waifu <br>Last week was a good week; I have to let go of that already.<br><br>Anyway, Rin isn't actively active, but she's not lazy either; if anything, her work as an idol keeps her fit, but she does genuinely enjoy exercising, so that's always a good thing.<br><br><br>Generally-speaking, I'd probably be more of the DPS/tank role while she'll have to be my healer/support, keeping me alive and buffed while I fight, something I'm good at. Although really, she could pass for a combat class herself, given the Dice de Cinderella game and what she could do with actual sword training. We could totally rock dual DPS.<br><br><br>Being a good cook, I'd hope so. Being around me, I'd hope so.<br><br><br>A phone strap/screen cleaner from Surfers Paradise. Hoped to replace my old Cospa strap with it, but ehh...I think I might hang this in my car instead.<br><br><br>Lee's Chicken. It's totally better than the KFC Mio brings around the office. Too bad Japan doesn't have it.<br><br><br>Rent a room and trash the it like rock stars; nothing more, nothing less. Party on, dude!<br><br><br> that doujin <br>You son of a bitch. That better not be from what I think it is.<br><br>Anyway, I take my hands and turn them upside-down while I place them underneath the window frame, utilizing all muscles in my arm from the deltoid to the forearm to lift in an upwards motion. That's what I'd do.<br><br><br>Karen and Nao are among my favorite idols too, so yes, Rin's friends are my friends too. Oh, Uzuki and Mio are good girls too, I suppose.<br><br><br>I don't see why we can't make it together! Two cooks in the kitchen are better than one...as long as one doesn't have a big ego, nya!<br><br>If you could get your waifu a car or motorbike, what would you get for her? <br><br>I'd like to get her a 4th gen Viper SRT-10 Coupe, blue with black racing stripes. But if that's too much speed for her, I'd just get her a classic black 5th gen Mustang convertible that she and her idol friends can cruise in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The queen of my heart and soul. <br><br><br>See you later friend, have a great time with your waifu.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She is the Queen of Ice and Snow.<br><br>A Motorbike.<br>While I'm not at all automobile savvy my Father is a massive Motorcycle buff and as such while I lack intricate knowledge on models and types I find Motorbikes a lot cooler than cars.<br>Besides, I feel like she'd have much more fun riding a Bike than sitting inside a Car.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her skirts are short enough to make any old man/neckbeard try to scold her and whine about how there's no more pure girls left in the world.<br><br>Oh, man. It was a few months ago while I was really sick.<br>I had a dream where we were on a train together, and she was resting her head on my shoulder while we looked at a magazine together. There was more to it but I can't really remember it now, I just remember that it felt very real and amazing.<br><br>The queen of imoutos!<br>and also the queen of my heart, of course.<br><br><br>Goodnight.<br><br>I can't say I'm all that familiar with car names, but something flashy and girly would fit her nicely, like a pink convertible.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Is she your princess blue?</br>  <br>A phone strap of her.<br><br>Mai has difficulties eating most types of food, so probably not.<br><br>Help her out.<br><br>Yes. She hangs out with 5 friends. They're pretty nice people.<br><br>Mai is an excellent cook, but I don't think she ought to prepare food all the time.<br><br>We never see her listening to music.<br><br>Perhaps it's on the "asking for it" category.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't exercise, but she's no lazy<br>She works hard to give everyone the best out of her support abilities<br><br><br>She'd be a healer and buffer, I'd be a tanky warrior<br>Mainly because she's always worried about protecting people and I'm pretty tall and a bit beefy<br><br><br>If there's fireworks she'd definitely prefer being outside, but otherwise we'd do something together in doors<br><br><br>I'd like to give her some ravioli or pizza<br><br><br>She's a pretty faithful person, and she never gives up even if she's dealing with stuff she doesn't quite understand<br><br><br>Help her, of course<br><br><br>Tell her it's pretty late and it's not healthy for her to be up at this hour, suggest we get a puppy or cat if she likes</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is a really healthy person. She goes running, swims, and makes all her meals at home with good ingredients. I don't see her getting sick from anything she does soon.<br><br><br>I always felt like stealth would suit Ai in fights, so maybe an assassin.<br><br><br>A garage kit of her. It's very nice<br><br><br>Some really spicy food that my family can make. I'd want to see if she would like it or not, or if she can handle spicy food at all.<br><br><br>Ok.<br><br><br>I didn't see her in it, but I know it was about her. I heard a voice sounding like an old lady telling me "I hope you meet a good woman soon" to which I replied "I already met a good woman." Then I woke up. Not too elaborate.<br><br><br>I don't know a thing about cars. However, one of my professors said the only reason she has a Mercedes Benz is, not because she wants to feel like a badass with an expensive car, but because if something goes wrong with it, they'll come pick up the car themselves, give you a rental, and drop it off at your house when the repairs are done. <br><br>So that. Make things easy for her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I jej'd.</br>  <br>I consider her the queen of gap moe.<br><br>Either a first-gen Renault Twingo, Skyline GT-R R33 or a Bentley 4½ Litre, depending on the budget.</br></br></br>  <br>She's the queen of my heart and soul/<br><br>I know nothing about cars. Something cheap and effective?</br></br></br>  <br>Well, I don't know how much my opinion is worth, but I think that even though having a waifu is wonderful and there are a lot of positive things about our waifus that we usually discuss here, not everything can be the happiest experience with your waifu ever, and I'd say it's even more important to talk about the more difficult things. Being a waifufag already (usually) involves a lot of hiding stuff from other people, and there's a limit to how much people can comfortably hide from everyone, so I think you shouldn't have to apologize for that.</br>  <br> flustered and staring silently at the ground <br>I'd ask if she was sick since she isn't normally like this. I'm surprised she hasn't attempted dragging me inside one yet.<br><br><br>Kurome's hairstyle is really cute.<br><br><br>She did that on purpose I bet. I'd ignore her for about 15 minutes and then help her out. She'd be pouting at me the whole time.<br><br><br>Continue watching cute animal videos with her, I don't sleep till 5 anyway.<br><br><br>She has a small group of amazing friends.<br>Also &gt;implying I'm not already great friends with them<br> The VN kind of just drops you into them as an established member. <br><br><br>We make dinner together; it's more fun that way and she loves when I eat her food, but I have to closely supervise her spice use.<br><br><br>Not sure, though she is a wonderful singer and I love her character song so yes, musically we are compatible.  I'd love to sing a duet with her on some old songs. <br><br><br>What my waifu and I do on our anniversary's lucid dream is no-ones business.<br><br><br>Archery<br> She is also MY Queen </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>She has, I'd be perfectly fine with befriending her<br><br><br>We could both make some decent dinner, but I'd enjoy cooking for her<br><br><br>She would listen to something oriental and smooth or some type of electronic beats<br>I don't mind either of them, so i am positive we'd both enjoy it<br><br><br>It reacher her knees<br><br><br>It was a pretty bad nightmare, i don't really like thinking about it<br><br><br>Kindness<br><br><br>I'd get her a car<br><br>What's your waifu's favorite weather?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Let's go with a Ferrari! <br><br><br>Probably Summer and Spring.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't really know much about motorbikes but I can see Erza choosing one that's really flashy, and probably expensive! <br><br><br>Sunny spells and clear skies! Perfect for adventure.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sonico i pretty qt</br>   wifubutt   <br>Tokiwadai forces her to wear cheeky skirts. Not opposed to it.<br><br>Never happened. Not even once.<br><br>I'd say of me, but that doesn't come close to describing it, and I sort of call someone else that as a joke.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just me.<br><br><br>Nothing.<br>;_;<br>Maybe this time i'll be luckier.<br>Goodnight.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Teasingly tell her to get herself out, and then after seeing her squirm for a bit begin the tickle attack. Hopefully she doesn't just kick me in the face in the process.<br><br>Grab a blanket, put it around the two of us and get comfy. That's a great mental image, anon.<br><br>Her friends are alright. It would be fun to do crazy stuff with her and Sayaka, and I wouldn't mind  befriending  Madoka.<br><br>I'd love to make dinner for her just to see the glow on her face when I bring it to her! I can't cook particularly well, though. I should fix that.<br> That red-haired girl from Madoka Magica has a nice character design. <br>She does, doesn't she? Hibike is a qt tomboy as well, one of my favourite idorus.<br><br>Probably dance and electro music seeing that she plays DDR. Lately I've been into the Sound Voltex Soundtrack, she'd like that.<br><br>Shorts are glorious!<br><br>Question time! Do you go on doki doki deitos with your waifu? Describe your last outing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The forest.<br>My heart.<br>Pointy ears.<br>Beauty.<br>Love.<br><br><br>I have no idea.<br>I know nothing about cars.<br> I don't even have a car. <br><br><br>Probably sunny, since she spends a lot of time outdoors.<br><br><br>No deitos here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Extremely active. <br><br><br>I'd assume her swordsmanship carries over.<br><br><br>Not a specific food, but my cooking.<br><br><br>Wonder when we got a love hotel district and check one out with her.<br><br><br>The greatest there ever was. But she'd rather cause commotion in real life.<br><br><br>Bullshit. If Nui got stuck for real she'd have uprooted the house getting out. So I feel no remorse in taking advantage of the situation.<br><br><br>Join for a bit, and start a bit of teasing until I get her to jump on me back in the bed.<br><br><br>I like to cook and can do so for both of us, but I can see her rather enjoying it too. Save for the waiting parts.<br><br><br>Everything. But she'd like me to say fashion, which is also accurate.<br><br><br>What about a helicopter?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This, ultra-cute and sexy all in one!<br><br><br>OOC. It's going to take a lot more than that to fluster Erica, and I'm not going to be frantically explaining anything either. We may consider grabbing a room for some fun!<br><br><br><br>Takao is cute and that red hairband is a great accessory!<br>See you soon.<br><br><br>Tease her with some rimming before helping her out.<br><br><br>Simply let her carry on watching, maybe briefly hang around to see one of them.<br><br><br>Yes - Trude, Minna, Hanna, Edytha, Waltrud, etc. They're all brilliant people so of course.<br><br><br>Her cooking skills are horrendous, so I take care of that.<br><br><br>Kraftwerk! Very much so.<br><br><br>Doesn't even wear one. I'm glad my wife isn't a boring prude. Now get out of here.<br><br><br>Erica is the Queen of Cutelewd!<br><br><br>A BMW, Audi, or Mercedes. Quality German engineering.<br><br><br>Yes. We went to the woods for some light exercise, walked into town, bought some ice-creams and ate them sitting in a sun-drenched field. It was a really great day!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Very, very active.<br><br>I would get her an nc750x.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, she likes fast cars. I wonder if she'd be happy behind the wheels of a maserati...<br><br><br>Any weather that gives her an excuse to take a swim.<br><br><br>We're due for one  especially since I just came back from a week-long retreat  The last date we had, she took me clothes shopping; she always liked posing in whatever clothes she finds interesting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How exactly do you guys go on dates with your special someone? I'm not quite sure how that works.  <br>Our last deito was nicel. We had a nice lovely stroll in the park. We had a picnic and looked at the clouds together. <br><br><br>Thank you, your waifu is cute too! <br><br><br>Later friend!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not a very good storyteller but I'll try. Let's see, firstly we met outside the local cake shop during early morning. She was already there and she scolds me for being late. We both entered the cake shop together and browse around. I told her she can choose any cake she wanted and immediately her eyes were twinkling. After a while, she finally stopped on a beautiful strawberry cheesecake, and I could see her mouth drooling. I end up buying her the cheesecake and we take a stroll along the riverbank. We settle down on a nice spot, where we eat the cheesecake together, with her feeding me some bites every now and then. Afterwards, we took another walk, holding each other's hands until finally the sun sets and we called it a day.<br><br>Speaking of which, gonna call it a day here too. Good night everyone!</br></br></br>  <br>Hail to you, glorius inhabitants of this thread, all your waifus are miracles of universe that deserve only best, I hope you all work hard in their sake!<br><br><br>Being on adventure with my Goddess sounds amazing, I would probably be some kind of defensive/healing class to protect her from all perils with my flesh and my soul.<br><br><br>My Goddess would be in charge of organizing celebrating for common citizens, so she would be pretty occupied, but after several encouraging speeches and pleasing everyone with radiant light of her glory, she probably would spend time with her sister and friends.<br><br><br>She surely is good martial artist and swordfighting expert, so I'm pretty sure she is!<br><br><br>Pre-ordered her figma. Not much of worthy merch were released for my Goddess, it makes me really sad and depressed at time, I hope to collect enough of money to make for myself custom figure of her.<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127789166 <br>Your too anon, in her special way all your waifus are most beautiful creatures in the universe!<br><br><br>I think something from our national cousin, which would be unusual for her.<br><br><br>I can't even imagine such situation, I believe I would be more embarassed than her!<br><br><br><br><br>Sure, I'd certainly would like to befriend her sister I'm pretty sure she is fun to hang out with and Gamagoori, he is such bro.<br><br><br>If my Goddess would honor me with something like dinner... I guess she would invite me in her mansion or restaraunt.<br><br><br>I'd bet on classic music and metal music, kinda suitable for her.<br><br><br>My Goddess does not wear skirts in general but if she do, they are usually pretty long, Kamui were developed by her father, so she could not pick design suitable for her.<br><br><br>I'm rare visitor of this places and it's time for me to depart. I wish you luck and to achieve eternal happiness with all your waifus my friends!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If you could get your waifu a car or motorbike, what would you get for her? <br>She already has one.</br></br>  <br>You know, you're definitely right. Anybody who truly loves their Waifu knows that it is no walk in the park.<br>With all the glorious, happy times their will surely be an equal amount of hard, troubling times.<br>These threads work as an outlet for all things waifu, good and bad.</br></br></br>  <br>Due to obvious circumstances I don't deito outside special occasions, but for this years anniversary I did setup and take a picture inside a restaurant. It was quiet, and a good break from the chaotic norm of doing everything myself.<br><br>With an object, picture, or thoughts of them on the mind as you go about what you're doing, which can be comparable to what you would do with another person. Or maybe you have a really good imagination.<br><br>Should go without saying, doing it often, and openly, may not be the best of ideas.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> With an object, picture, or thoughts of them on the mind as you go about what you're doing, <br>Oh, well then I do that all the time.</br></br>  <br>Let me guess, she's your phone wallpaper?</br>  <br>Despite having power over Ice and Snow it seems she is more happy and comfortable during the Summer/Spring seasons.<br><br>We laid atop a roof together,  holding hands , looking at the stars.</br></br></br>  <br>No, I just think about her all the time, about how amazing she is and about us. I love her more than anything.</br>    I feel like my waifu deserves a better husbando than me.  <br>Then improve yourself you fucking piece of shit.</br>  <br>Me too.<br><br>But whether someone deserves better than you or not is not your choice to make.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I feel the same way. I need to be the absolute best at everything. But something like that is very difficult.</br></br>  <br>I've been becoming a better man for her, but some days man, I don't know what gets into me. I don't even know if she'd look upon what I do as bad or inconsequential, necessarily.</br>  <br>She has a great determination hat everyone should have.<br><br>I won't lie.  I'd laugh a little and of course I'd help her. But first, I would start by grabbing her butt to see where this goes. She would be really embarrased, moaning and pouting but if she likes it then we both win. <br><br>Join her.<br><br>Yes, and yes. They are nice friends and I wouldn't mind spending fun time with them.<br><br>She would be cooking 80% of the time since that's the way she is.<br><br>Not sure.<br><br>From provocative to proper.<br><br> Lewd stuff <br><br>Sh'es the queen of my heart, she's my Killer Queen, she's the prettiest girl ever, the cutest in the universe, the perfect girl, the one, the only one and the best. She's my best friend and my hope. She's my gold experience, my dream, my motivation and my love.<br><br>Good idea. Take care, anon.<br><br>I don't know much about vehivles. I'd get her a car, since it's less dangerious and more comfortable than a motorbike.<br><br>Sunny fresh.<br><br>I went on a trip to another city with her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is it, looks like.<br><br><br>Turn 360 degrees and walk out the way we came, maybe I'd seize the chance to crack a joke or two about how seedy Downtown still is. For as much of a lewd dude as I am, love hotels don't appeal to me.<br><br><br>Kurome is really cute, and has an interesting 'mystique' about her. <br><br><br><br>Pull him out  after we finish~ <br><br><br>Join in, of course. Not like 3 am is especially late for me. Plus it's always good to see him relating positively to cute animals. <br><br><br>Yep, and I probably would. Maka is very pleasant (plus she helped enormously in bringing out my husbando's better side), Soul is a pretty cool dude, and everyone else is fine too, more or less.<br><br><br>I'd make dinner most of the time. Cooking together would be fun though, and I'm sure we can find the time to do it often enough. <br><br><br>Sounds like a wonderful dream. As for your question, I don't know. I imagine he's pretty impressionable in that regard, so he'll probably at least put up with most of what I listen to.<br><br><br> 404 <br>Lower than the lowest mark, by the looks of the thumbnail. And it's a robe, I'll have you know.<br><br><br>The closest thing I've had to a "dream" of him recently was when I 'woke up' to find him in my room, looking right down at me. And then I woke up again. I'm honestly really jelly of you guys and your coherent, fleshed-out waifu dreams ;_;<br><br><br>Black blood, perhaps? Or the  moon ? Or, wait, no.  My heart . That's for sure.<br><br><br>An older Ford Escort. I think he'd look super cute behind the wheel of one, and he should be able to drive it with relative ease.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nevermind, I'm dumb. Still 2-3 inches or so below matronly though.<br><br><br>Probably the milder weather of spring and fall, but he doesn't seem to have any problems putting up with the Nevada desert heat. Seeing him experience his first (?) snowfall here would be super cute.<br><br><br><br><br>Take care, see ya later! <br><br><br>Kinda, yeah. We went on a walk around a lake down in the city last week. It was a gorgeous day to be on the lakeshore (especially with my lover), and hopefully we'll be able to do it again sometime soon.  And hopefully not spend 15 minutes driving in circles next time. <br><br><br>It's basically just a matter of going out and doing something I think he'd enjoy, picturing him with me and his reactions to stuff as we go along.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is indeed a miracle, and I will treat her like the miracle she is. Thank you, OP.<br><br>She's healthy and active, because in her line of work there shouldn't be a single second wasted.<br><br>She will be undoubtedly a swordsman, a paladin or some other class that uses swords, because she fucking loves swords.<br>I'd pick a support-type because I don't want to be in her way so I'll just support her from behind.<br><br>I don't think she has enough time to enjoy festive occasions and holidays because she's a busy person, but I can imagine her slipping time for it somehow.<br>I'd like to celebrate it alone with her because if we went out together in public her idol career might be smashed into pieces.<br><br>More than you might think.<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127789166 <br>Thank you Jebus, you're waifu a qt too.<br><br>Her friends, of course. They make a good RPG party.<br><br>I always wondered if she likes seafood and stuff.<br><br>My waifu really looks good wearing shades.<br><br>I'll carry her away from it and we'll go to the cake shop or the nearest motorcycle shop.<br><br>Ganaha Hibiki is cute, though I always wonder how she manages to tame lots of animals.<br><br>I pull her out of course, then ask if she's okay then proceed to have dinner.<br><br>I'll watch it with her, if she looks too immersed in whatever she's watching I'll prepare food for her.<br><br>She has.<br>More like I'll be the one who'll get befriended like crazy.<br><br>I'd be the one making it, because I don't want her to burn the whole house down. It'll be more safer for both of us and the whole neighborhood if I'm going to be the one to cook.<br><br>Pop and many others I guess, she needs to know many genres so her songs will be nice and diverse. <br>I guess, I usually like anything that sounds good to my ears.<br><br>Cheeky, I guess?<br> This reminds me that my waifu won't wear her uniform anymore because she's already a graduate. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have shit memory so I might not just remember about it, but I don't think I had any dreams of her lately.<br><br>Queen of Swords? I don't know, but one thing I'm sure is she's the Queen of My Heart.<br><br>Goodbye.<br><br>I'm not really an expert but I'll definitely give her a cool motorbike.<br>Though it might just turn out that she'll educate me instead and go full discovery channel on me or something and tell me the this and that of motorbikes and stuff.<br><br>I don't think she cares about weather that much, but I think she'll be bothered when its raining and she has a concert because she'll be worried about her fans.<br><br>Yes.<br> We went to an ocean park and we saw lots of marine animals, watched dolphin shows and such. Most of the time I was looking at her face so I was completely blank when she asked me what was my favorite part of our date. Then I just answered that my favorite part was all of it because I was with her all the time, she was a bit flustered and gave me a shy smile, then I bought her a big ass dolphin stuff toy she can cuddle all day long. <br><br>You literally just imagine it.<br>You can also write it somewhere so you can remember it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It fluctuates, though her default look is somewhere between proper and matronly, depending on how long the artist draws her dress.</br>  <br>My waifu listens to all kinds of music, but loves to sing herself the most! Seeing as I love to listen to her sing, I think we will be just fine!<br><br>Hibiki doesn't enjoy wearing super girly or frilly clothes like that.<br><br>I dreamed that I was a Slider and found myself in the Im@s universe where I ran into Hibiki and fell in love all over again. We then proceeded to go on an adventure together and explore other worlds together. Then my phone woke me up. Sometimes I wish that when I go to sleep that I would never wake up so that I could dream about my waifu forever.<br><br>Hibiki is the queen of my heart.<br><br>Ramiel is a reflective blue octahedron, not you're waifu, anon.<br><br>I'd be scared shitless to have her ride a motorcycle due to losing a lot of close family to idiot drivers who don't pay attention when changing lanes. I'd probably get her a Shelby Mustang in cerulean with black racing stripes.<br><br>She can appreciate most weather, so long as it isn't too hot!<br> pic related <br><br>That's lewd, anon.<br><br>う憩いみそーれー !<br><br>We took all the animals out to the local park and let them run around while we watched from a nearby bench and ate some frozen yogurt.<br><br>You just have to carry them with you in your heart when you go out, anon!<br><br>Thanks, anon. See you around!<br><br>That's a good mentality to have. To make an effort to improve yourself for the sake of the one you care about the most, that is the true meaning of love.<br><br>Your waifu suddenly becomes the MC of the last show you watched (no harems), what happens?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Your waifu suddenly becomes the MC of the last show you watched (no harems), what happens? <br>Ryuko replaces Goku. There is nothing that can go wrong.</br></br>  <br> One Outs <br><br>Rias replaces Tokuchi. I don't know if she's got the gambling skill of Tokuchi but she's certainly strategy-minded enough to come out on top no matter what the Owner does. The baseball world isn't ready for a real devil though.</br></br></br>  <br>I keep her in my mind and heart when I do anything.<br><br>Work to improve yourself! Become that better husbando!<br><br>Hanako replaces Jotaro. I don't think she's cut out for a battle series.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know that feeling but there is always self improvement.</br>  Has your waifu done anything wrong?  Be honest, how would you both react to  see each other naked for the first time? <br>I want creative answers.</br>  <br>Probably.</br>  <br>We do!<br>We went to a strip of shops a week or so ago, it was super fun. I had a lot of fun looking over the clothing in one of the shops and seeing which outfits would look best on her! Afterwards, we stopped at a new homemade ice cream and chocolate shop that opened up, it was really nice.<br><br>You know that episode of Spongebob about imagination?<br>Well, that.<br><br>Work to improve yourself instead of sitting in a puddle of your own self-hatred.<br>I don't believe you should change yourself completely for your waifu, but instead work on the little things one by one.<br><br>The last show I watched was Jewelpet Sunshine.<br>That's... definitely a change. I'd love to see her in Kanon's cute cardigan, though, and they're personalities are sort of similar.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Good night, thread. Have sweet and wonderful waifu dreams tonight.    <br>Not that i know of, she always does the right thing for other's sake</br>  <br>I suspect she has a taste for lighter, softer melodies, while I'm more metal.<br>Our musical tastes are bound to clash.<br><br> Jojo <br>Damn, that'd be awesome.<br>I wonder what her stand would be and could she beat DIO?<br><br>She was almost executed for committing a felon once.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, she is my Princess Blue. And if I made a band with her as our lead singer, I would name the band Princess Blue, because I'm not going to let a perfectly good unit name go to waste. <br><br><br> R33 <br>Impeccable taste, and coincidentally underrated as the middle child.<br><br><br>I'd say at least warm weather. I mean, walking dogs in the cold isn't favorable, and flowers aren't exactly cold-friendly either.<br><br><br>It may seem sad to say, but I don't remember the last time we had one. Most times it's just doing cute stuff together, like viewing the skyline on top of the office building at night, going on drives with her in the passenger's seat, going shopping, and stuff like that.<br><br>Wait, no, I remember; I brought her with me to see Jurassic World. I bet going to Jurassic World would be a fun experience. You know...before there was running and screaming, and broken down attractions started eating people.<br><br><br>Get your waifu to the choppah!<br><br>Yes, aircraft is fine too.<br><br><br>Daydreaming.<br><br><br>Last show, huh? And what would that be...I only watched a detached episode of Daredevil with my brother recently, but I don't follow that show. I guess then it would be Person of Interest. I guess that makes Rin working for Team Machine; idol gets sucked into the clandestine world of AI surveillance and must save people before trouble happens while fighting off those that want to shut the Machine down. Can an idol even go off the grid in the first place? Who cares; I wanna see Rin carry a firearm.<br><br><br>I'm not comfortable with my naked self by myself. And I'm sure even for someone who has to wear skimpy outfits for work, an intimate situation would be extremely embarrassing for Rin, since one-on-one is a very personal confrontation.<br><br>I would say it would look like someone was at an Italian restaurant and someone flipped an entire table of meals over on the ground. Yeah, let's run with that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I would look her straight in the eyes and take her hand, before appreciating ever inch of her beautiful body, before liking back up and smiling to her<br>As she sees mine, i would take a step back and pose a bit, put one hand behind my head and another on my hip, i'd ask her what she thinks<br>I don't have an amazing body, but my arms and legs are pretty toned, so i guess i could show those off</br></br> </br>  <br>No</br>  If your second favorite anime girl became real and was interested in you, would you try to seriously date her, or would you stay true to your waifu?<br><br>There is no chance of the same thing happening to your waifu.</br></br>  <br>In terms of physical activity, Chihiro is more "lazy". She isn't a slob and she isn't unhealthy, she's just not physically active.<br><br><br>We would likely be classes that cover each other's weaknesses. Like a knight and a mage. Not 100% on what classes would be.<br><br><br>By creating memories with me<br><br><br>No.<br><br><br>I'm not so sure. There is a lot I could have her try, but a lot she's already had.<br><br><br>From Twitter, and the first time I checked there!<br><br><br>"Love was on my mind, but not that kind! Unless, that's what was on yours?"<br><br><br>Join her.<br><br><br>I would try to learn how to cook. However, if she can cook, I'll gladly do the dishes.<br><br><br>Flirty, even if the name is inaccurate given standard skirt lengths these days.<br><br><br>I dreamt of her recently, she was at a shrine in Tokyo praying, and her and I rang the bell together! It was really cute!<br><br><br>JUSTICE!<br><br><br>If I had to guess, I'd imagine she'd like a cool autumn day<br><br><br>Eternal diet of no potato chips or soda continues!<br><br><br>Chihiro becomes associated with the Star Arcana instead of Justice, and shouts ORAORAORAORAORA! On top of that she becomes monstrously muscular.<br><br>It's a funny mental image, I'll give it that.<br><br><br>She overreacted. She did the right thing in the wrong way.<br><br><br>Several things wrong with this.<br><br>1. Chihiro is not a "character" to me, she is Chihiro.<br>2. Chihiro is much more than a "favorite", she is very important to me.<br>3. Obviously I would not, because Chihiro comes first.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What kind of fucking question is this<br>Fuck off</br></br>  <br> Bikini Warriors <br><br>please no<br>please no more<br>no no NO<br>no more<br><br><br>My waifu did nothing wrong.<br>Ever.<br><br><br>Me? I'd be super aroused, and super nervous, probably.<br>You know when you're holding something extremely precious and valuable and you think seven times every single thing you do so as to not fuck things up? Something like that.<br><br>And she, well, I've no idea. I'm not hideous looking I think, but I'm also not Adonis  while she certainly looks like Aphrodite.  She's rather easily embarrassed, and also there's the virgin thing which would make her as nervous as I am, maybe even more.<br><br>It'd be adorably awkward.<br> I'd take charge, and try to make her first time a beautiful and memorable moment for her. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She would be a Magus since she already uses magic and a weapon, and I would be a Monk or something else that kicks things.<br><br><br>She likes to celebrate with friends and family.<br><br><br>She regularly handles swords, so I would think so.<br><br><br>I got Bardiche, and I'm waiting for that Alter figure to be released.<br><br><br>I would ask her if  she wants to try it out or if it would be better at home. <br><br><br>Erica is an amazing pilot.<br><br><br>Help her out  by grabbing her hips and butt. <br><br><br>Join her, I'm probably not asleep anyways.<br><br><br>She does and they're great, but I'm the one that would be getting befriended.<br><br><br>I'd want to surprise her with dinner.<br><br><br>She wears things that go from provocative to proper.<br><br><br>Lightning.<br>My heart.<br><br><br>If I could find the right one, a Ferrari.<br><br><br>Sunny weather, since it's better for being outside.<br><br><br> Drive <br>She can fight very well, but I don't know if she can destroy the Roastporkos.<br>She can also already transform.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't Haku a man</br>  <br>Not that I know of... <br><br><br> I would be aroused by her perfect body and will touch her all over. She would be blushing and smiling at me. I'm not sure what she would think of my body. Probably just average compared to hers. </br></br></br></br>  If your waifu has had multiple designs of any sort across any form of media, which do you prefer most?  <br>It's a feeling I feel all too often. On the other hand, you have to give her some credit; have faith in her just as she has faith in you. The fates brought you together for a purpose, and I doubt she'd just sit around and let you wallow in a pity-party.<br><br> Sailor Moon <br>Always did like seeing her as a magical girl, even if she wasn't involved in the Vocaloid cover of 'Moon Pride'.<br><br>She'd be red as a cherry, while I'd...just grab on and hold her close, trying to get her to relax with my own body heat. She'd turn away, but then I'd have my arms around her waist, caressing her belly and navel with a soft touch; perhaps I'd even tease her with soft breaths along the curve of her neck...<br><br>Definitely the latter. After all the time we've spent together, I'd be one major asshole to just turn around and dump her for the next big thing.<br><br>Truth be told, I'm not all that big on her current V4X appearance. Granted, the face is beyond pretty, but the dress is too revealing on top. I like her original design much better.<br><br>Building off of my first response...Supposing you weren't feeling your best or feel into one of those downer moods. How would your special one try and snap you out of your funk?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Good - nobody's claimed her yet but me.  <br> claimed <br>That's not how it works.</br></br>  Satsuki of course  <br>She's mine, damn it! ALL MINE! That jew motherfucker Lawrence can go die in a pit!</br>  <br>Thanks for the sentiment and creating the thread OP.<br><br>She's not a very active person for sure, although she's somehow fit enough to fight.<br><br><br>Unfortunately, she's not shown doing that sort of thing. I'd like to do stuff with her, Janie and Febrie, anything from participating in events and celebrations down to BBQing or just watching coverage on TV together.<br><br><br>She has deft hands so probably.<br><br><br>I have none because there is none except keychains.<br><br>I intend to commission art when I get a job however, I guess that counts.<br><br><br>Spicy food. I can literally walk out and get her some.<br><br><br>I doubt she'd be flustered, but for argument's sake; I'd say "It was a mistake, but it was almost worth it to see you blushing like this."<br><br>Followed by getting out of there or listening to her snappy comeback. There are some smooth customer husbandos here but by god, it'd be awkward as shit for her and I. If we cover it up with banter it'd be better. <br><br> Then maybe we could go at it back home or come back another time. <br><br><br>Pretty good, she'd put some thought into it and post sophist critiques that seem intellectual but mean nothing.<br><br><br>Yomiko is a crazy cute nerd.<br>Shinobu and her would probably get along.<br><br><br>She doesn't play lame games like that if she wants my attention.<br><br>I'd ask her how long she's been stuck there, if she needs the restroom I might let her stew for a while.<br>I'm still gonna help her out very quickly, but not without some teasing. More teasing can come later when she's safe. <br><br><br>Join her.<br><br><br>Yes, the Railgun four.  I would, would be nice to meet them at least since they seem nice.<br><br><br>I'd like to but I'd suck at it. I might end up having to since she works hard.<br><br><br>No idea. I'm willing to give everything a go as long as it isn't EDM so probably.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Second favorite anime girl <br>It seems like you don't understand, you're waifu isn't just your No.1 favorite anime girl.<br>I'd stay true to Rukia the difference in my feelings between her and anyone else is beyond universal.<br><br>Rukia's design has changed ever so slightly throughout Bleach with a rather large change after timeskip.<br>I always thought Kubo's early art was best, and personally I find early Rukia's design the most appealing to myself.<br><br>Brining people back from the depths of despair is one of her best abilities.<br>Whether it be beating the sense back into me or consoling me like a mother she knows exactly how to bring a smile back to my face, regardless of the situation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably anything that means she can stay in bed. I like rain myself, so we'll go with stormy weather. Though everyone likes a nice clear day every now and then.<br><br><br>Gangsta. Oh dear. <br><br><br>no, she's a good girl.<br><br><br>lots of blushing, I'd imagine. Followed swiftly by  lewd activities  <br><br><br>cuddles and tea. Her mere presence would do wonders to lift my spirits though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I get what you're saying, but your waifu is technically your favorite anime girl, is she not? It's much more correct than calling your 2nd favorite anime girl your "backup waifu".</br></br>  <br>Compared to the 3 other goddesses, Blanc's design in Victory has to be the most contrasting. I personally find it a nice change of pace from just the white and blue snowy-design. (pic-related)<br><br>Does your waifu have an in-series nickname? If so, what is it?<br><br>Her's is  Blanny Blanny Bii </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My waifu isn't just a character to me, though. My favorite anime character is. Completely different things.</br>  <br>theres really a lot of foods I'd like to show her, as I cook a lot and have many of my own recipes and flavours.<br>probably start her off on something simple but tasty, maple chili and then move onto applebread for desert.<br><br><br>she'd take most any excuses for some fun <br><br><br>splat<br><br><br> cuddle while watching cute animal videos <br><br><br>pull her out, she's been trapped there for who knows how long and the window molding is digging into her hips which would be painful.<br> and then baby her <br><br><br> she was rubbing her head on my chest while laying in bed trying to sleep <br> sometimes dreams are very simple <br><br><br>hey mine too<br><br><br>shes the sort to like it when it's clear and sunny, though I prefer the cool rains myself.<br> and now I'm thinking of walking around with her looking at rainbows. <br><br><br> hating lawrence <br>lawrence is a good man and I will not have you attempting such crude language about him Amarti.<br>A real korbro would not behave like you are, so please make amendments while you can.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> theres <br> foods <br>Would it not be there are?</br></br></br>  <br>If you're the kind of person who gets annoyed at typos and shit, you should probably filter the old man before you go insane.</br>  <br>She is Genki and Lazy.<br><br><br>Shit i dunno, i would pick a knight as so would she.<br><br><br>National foods.<br><br><br>Ok~<br><br><br>Tell her it's not healthy and she can cuddle with her teddy bear (me)<br><br><br>She does and hell yeah i would<br><br><br>Misao can't cook for SHIT m8, so i would have to cook.<br><br><br>Flirty<br><br><br>Today, we even kissed~<br><br><br>Summer<br><br><br>She can be childish but no, she is a pure innocent girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know cars but I'd get her a car instead of a motorbike which seems dangerous.<br><br>I kind of want to ride with her as she hugs up to me behind on the bike though.<br><br><br>I have never dreamed of her. Her name's invariably my first word when I wake though.<br><br><br>Before her anime arc it'd have been rainy gloom; after it sunny joy.<br><br><br>I did yesterday, but I took a detour to check some stuff out and it ended up being not fun.<br><br>I think I'll have dinner with her sometime next week!<br><br><br>Imagination and picturing her there with me.<br><br><br> but for this years anniversary I did setup and take a picture inside a restaurant. <br>That sounds lovely.<br><br><br>Hi 7-san!<br><br><br> MC of Triage X <br>She'd ruin the show by questioning its premises.<br><br><br>To the authorities yes, but to me no.<br><br><br>She would be shy of course, because it'd be the first time for either of us. She'd be familiar with bodies due to working in psych and other experiments, so she might possibly be less embarrassed on the surface until she strips down.<br><br>I would be aroused as all hell, but also shy as fuck. What we'd do is to take it slowly and build skinship with one another.<br><br>hard question to answer.<br><br><br>surprisingly lewd picture<br><br><br>I prefer her anime look. All are her though.<br><br><br>Be with me and ask if I have anything on my mind. Listen to me rant and verbal spaghetti until I feel better. Hugs. <br><br><br>"Fish-eyed girl", thanks Misaka. <br><br><br>What are some/is one surefire way you have of feeling close to her? I look at her pictures and rewatch her series. Cuddle sometimes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whoops, I meant "that creepy girl". Fish-eyed is a fan moniker.</br>  <br>When she became more popular, she started to neglect her pets, but promptly fixed her behavior once she realised what she had done.<br><br>I have a bad body-image, so to open up to someone like that would be extremely embarrassing the first time, especially if it's someone i'm emotionally invested in. It would probably begin with an awkward standoff, but once we both realise that we feel the same way, we'd gradually get more comfortable being naked in front of each other.<br><br>Goodnight!<br><br>I don't cheat.<br><br>Listening to her sing always works for me!<br><br>Would you scare your waifu just to see her reaction?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A date of course.<br><br><br>N-no<br><br><br>A fig<br><br><br>Tell her she is just getting ideas and we can go some other day.<br><br><br>MISAO IS THE CUTEST<br><br><br>Help her out, no lewd.<br><br><br>I bet she listens to pop&amp;rock, i like a lot of music so we could listen to some together.<br><br><br>Queen of Genkiness and Fangs.<br><br><br>Look at her pics, but mostly drawing her.<br><br><br>I would, it would be qt as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe, because I'd want to kill myself if I accidentally made her cry or something. She's really not good with scary things. Even like "bedsheet over myself and making ghost noises" would freak her out.</br>  <br>Misaofag is alive. Where you been</br>  <br>holy fuck scared Hibiki so fucking cute<br>that wavy mouth<br><br>I hope you'd hug her really tight until all the fear went away</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're damn right I would! Here, have a warm smile.</br>  <br> Shimoneta <br>I don't know, its completely a different world from hers.<br><br>She went full edgelord once, but she changed now and she's an alphalord that might be way more manlier than I am.<br><br> First time I'll se her naked body I'll feel a sudden rush of hotness throughout of my body, like I'm suddenly thrown into a sauna, I will be captivated by her beautiful frame, her slender body, her wonderful thighs, and of course I will look at her beautiful face. When she sees me naked for the first time, I can imagine her trying to look away from embarrassment but failing to do so because she's curious and she wants to see every inch of her partner's body  <br><br><br>I'd still go after my waifu.<br>My second favorite anime girl is just the girl I really want to be friends/bros with, not the one I want to marry.<br><br>The original, of course. Manga Tsubasa looks really nice but the anime Tsubasa is really the one I like the most.<br><br>She'll try to talk it out with me, or sing a song for me and hope I'll snap out of it, or she'll just straightforwardly kick my ass and tell me to get my shit together.<br><br>Hello, Shinobubro.  I'd really like to give something to you today, but I can't because I have nothing to give. <br><br>I do the same, and sometimes I draw pictures of her. <br><br>I would, but I'm scared if she might pull a katana out of nowhere and cut me up because she thought I was an enemy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Look at images, marvel at my figures, watch her show, read her manga and listen to her character songs. These all do wonders for me.<br><br>Of course, nothing wrong with a little spook every now and again.<br>It'd take a lot to scare her however.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really. She tries not to interact with others much.<br><br> implying the possibility I'd ever choose anyone else over her exists <br><br>She doesn't.<br><br>Hug me, and remind me that she loves me.<br><br>I think about her, look at pictures of her, and think about our life together.<br><br>Maybe.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry about it dude. That's a big Tsubasa.<br><br><br>Of course I would, I'm a big bully.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I started at Index, but the more polished designs in Railgun really stuck, so that's what I like most.<br><br>Remember that for us, a waifu isn't just some character.<br><br>If I'm at home, lying with and/or holding one of her cushions or daki is infallible. If I'm out, a simple rub of my left pinky into my ring finger to feel the band it works every time.<br><br>I've seen it plenty of times thanks to the dorm manager. I've no wish to stress her further.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>cute</br>  <br>My half-dead waifu is very active finding and cooking to Yuyuko-sama</br>  <br>I really like her manga design, though her anime design is qt as well<br><br><br>Hello<br><br><br>A big hug and a kiss followed by "I love you~"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What a  cute  looking girl.</br>  <br>thank you, she is</br>  Good night, /a/. Have dreams with your waifus in them.  <br>Probably look me in the eyes and ask me what's wrong<br><br><br>I do her S.Link when i feel like i miss her <br><br><br>Yes, she has the cutest reactions in the world</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like the way the original artist drew her. <br><br><br>As of recent I've been cuddling a lot with her and we sleep together. <br><br><br>Maybe...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>good night anon</br>  <br>Cute waifu.</br>  <br>As 7-san mentioned, his friends would make excellent party members. He's already familiar with them, after all. <br><br><br>Crona in Gangsta would be, uh, interesting? The cityscape actually does evoke a grimdark re envisioning of Death City, for that matter.<br><br><br>Many things, but he did what he could to right them and came out the better for it. Something I applaud him for, and part of why I respect him as much as I do.<br><br><br>Blushing, self-consciousness, and arousal, mutually. I talk a lot of talk, and have a lot of very lewd fantasies, but something tells me I'd end up only a bit less jittery and awkward than he would. For the first time, anyway. <br>I'm sure it wouldn't be easy at all for him, especially considering how conservative almost all of his outfits are, his shyness, and how negatively he views himself, so I'd take the lead and be sure to take it slow. Hopefully making our first time a great time, and making him feel good. <br><br> It does bear mentioning that our first time making love (or my first time seeing him nude in general, should it precede that) would finally be my chance to find out his 'real' gender. One less unanswered question, at long last. <br><br><br>Goodnight, Riasbro. <br><br><br>Oh boy, "waifu=favorite animu grill" again. No.<br><br><br>I like his baseline anime appearance the best, not that he looks too terribly different once you set aside his different powers and getups in the manga.<br><br><br>I think he'd earnestly ask what was wrong, and if I wanted to talk about it. He has a very calming and disarming presence to me; simply being able to cuddle and maybe explain whatever's going on and hear his opinion on it would help immensely. <br><br><br> if she needs the restroom I might let her stew for a while. <br>I like the way you think~</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>t-thanks!</br>  Does being a bringer of ruin mean active?<br>If so, then yes.</br>  Robin-chan all the way  <br>MisaoMania until the day i die!<br><br><br>It's pretty late, i'm off as well, good night.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He has the quasi-official title of Demon Swordsman, and I believe Ragnarok calls him a pansy. Pansies are cute, dainty flowers, so it fits.<br><br><br>Rewatching his episodes, mostly. Looking at pictures of him too, if I'm in the right mood. The feeling of closeness comes around randomly, otherwise. <br><br><br>Maybe rarely. He'd have a cute reaction, that I know, but at the same time I wouldn't want to frighten him just for the sake of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If you were stuck in the woods for a week and only had one picture of your waifu to keep your spirits up, which would it be?  <br>Also this...</br>  <br><br><br>The retard convention is down the hall guys, you've got the wrong place.</br></br></br>  Welp. off to sleep<br>Night, thread</br>  <br>this one!</br>  I've hit my limit for tonight.<br>Goodnight everyone.</br>  <br>Listening to her music, looking at her pictures,  spooning in bed with her  , but for the most part, just thinking about her in general.<br><br>Only if I want to get something thrown at me. So, yes.<br><br><br> stuck in the woods <br> had to do just that <br><br>Wish I had chosen a better picture, in that case.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  :')  <br>This one.</br>  <br> It would be pretty embarrassing for the both of us. Lots of stammering and whatnot, especially from my end.<br>She's easily flustered, so I would do my best to not embarrass her too bad. The first thing I'd do is tell her how amazing she looks.<br>She wears some pretty revealing clothing, but nothing would ever compare to actually seeing her nude in front of me, I'm sure it'd be amazing.<br>Just the fact that I said so much just to basically say "it would be embarrassing but amazing" should tell you how much I'd be a babbling fool during it.</br></br></br> <br><br>Her designs stay the same throughout her different media, mostly.<br>I prefer the original LN art the most, especially the art of her during the part where she changes her hairstyle.<br>God, I wish they animated that scene so badly.<br><br> surprisingly lewd picture <br>Indeed! Very cutelewd.<br><br>Whenever I feel the need to be close and personal with her, cuddling her daki or spending some time just gazing at my shrine of her usually works. I also occasionally rewatch my favorite episodes.<br><br>Only around Halloween when it's appropriate to go around scaring people! Otherwise I'd feel bad.<br>Seeing her spooked reaction would be adorable, though. I just hope she wouldn't get too mad at me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends. I can see her pulling out a tough-love sort of motivation-tak (ie: telling me to stop sulking because it never solves anything).<br>If that doesn't work and I'm still feeling down I  hope  she'd do stuff like sitting down with me and hearing what I have to say or simply  letting me rest my head on her shoulder.<br><br>That would be so nice.</br></br> <br><br><br> 'Thousand year old virgin.' <br><br><br>Look at pictures of her.<br>Look at my phone with her as my wallpaper.<br>Just think about stuff.<br><br>Sometimes it feels hard to get across to her, though, which sucks.<br><br><br> my waifu <br> scared <br><br><br> Stuck in the woods for a week. <br><br>If I was stuck in the woods, I'd need no picture of her to remember her or keep my spirits up as the mere sight, smell and sounds of the woods would bring her image to my head, as clear as crystal.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm currently watching Railgun S, and I'm curious as to what you found appealing about Misaka. The first season's pacing felt a bit odd to me, and her character didn't seem as fleshed out as she could have been. Or am I just missing something?<br><br><br><br>This.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> misaka <br><br> anon pls </br></br></br>  <br>She is quite healthy and active, as a young girl should be.<br><br>Thanks, OP! You too.</br></br></br>  <br> Misaka </br>  <br>Your waifu always wrecks my shit when I play PCB.</br>  <br><br><br>I'm guessing that'll make more sense once I finish S then? Some shit about major plot twists or something?</br></br></br>  <br> one week <br>I'm a big boy and one week isn't going to deter me at all, I've done longer for fun.<br><br>for a month+ though, i think this image would cheer me up.<br>something about sharing despair makes despair not seem so bad<br><br> realistically though if I was stumbling around the woods for over a month I'd probably be spending a lot more time with her than usual <br><br><br>major plot twist spoiler,  you fucking mixed their names up dummy </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a big Shinobu too.<br>Its currently my wallpaper, moments where Tsubasa smiles are rare moments that needs to be taken a good picture of and kept for ages.<br><br>I'd bring this because It'll remind me to keep on living.<br><br>Get your eyes checked or something.<br><br>Nice taste, I always like using your waifu in Touhou fighting games.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably the same pic I posted here<br>Because of her wonder-filled face and there's a little bit of that sweet nip</br></br>  <br> pic related <br>I go operate innawoods all the time, so a week ain't no thang. <br><br>Would you go operate innawoods with your waifu? Or would you rather stay at home and watch netflix n chill?</br></br></br></br>  <br>This one. My husbando's smile is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen, and the context of this one in particular is heartwarming.  It doesn't last, sadly. <br><br><br>Sweet dreams, Rukiabro. <br><br><br>Definitely the latter. Trying to do some shootan for the first time might be fun though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, no. You see, sometimes I'll feel really depressed thinking about how she's not here with me, so I rather not bring those upon myself by pretending she is. However, every so often I'll ask myself "what would we do together if she were here right now", and I daydream for a little bit. Unless that's what you meant, then yes.<br><br><br> Rokka no Yuusha <br>She becomes  one of  the chosen ones. Cool.<br><br><br>That's really lewd.<br> The only reaction that comes to my mind is me smiling at her, hugging her and telling her I love her. She'd blush and say it back, I hope. <br><br><br>There's a manga, a VN, and an anime, and save for a few really specific details, her design is the same in all of them.<br><br><br>Depends on why I'm sad. But I can imagine her being stern and telling me to snap out of it, or she can be really nice and soothing. She can be both good cop and bad cop when she needs to.<br><br><br>Listen to a love song. For sure. Before I met Ai, I thought they were all corny, but I find myself relating to them more, so that helps a bit. <br><br><br>Maybe. Not too bad though, just to tease her.<br><br><br>I'm really fond of this picture.<br><br><br>Well, she'd probably want to go outdoors, so the woods it is. Plus it's a good opportunity to teach her to shoot.<br><br><br>Is you're waifu one to give up easily, or is she tenacious?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Last post for the night. Had fun as always. See you guys later and have a great time with your waifus.  <br>You know what, nevermind I'll stay here for a bit longer.</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Me and my waifu would live innawoods.<br>It'd be a fun life, you know, even if I'd have to drop a lot of commodities and stuff. Anything for her.<br><br>Plus the outdoors sex would be amazing.<br><br><br>Super tenacious.<br>Training is vital for her to become stronger, so it's safe to assume she's not one to back uo when stuff gets complicated.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hibiki is very headstrong and competitive, so im gonna go with tenacious!<br><br><br>Should you stay or should you go?<br><br>Post a picture of your waifu's best friend!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good taste anon<br><br>Very good.</br></br></br>  <br>In the woods? Probably not. Under the sea, on the other hand... <br><br><br>Definitely tenacious. Luka hates to give up without giving it her everything, and it's a standard I try to strive for myself.<br><br><br>The two of them can be close to inseparable at times.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not even sure. Also here she is with Suzu and Fuuri. <br><br><br>I say tenacious. <br><br><br>Whatever she wants to do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe because it sounds fun and I will learn lots of things from her. She's probably an expert in survival things.<br><br>She's tenacious. She might have been batshit insane when her best friend died, but still she tried to live in her own way, though it led her trying to commit suicide, she still came back and now she's a respectable senpai and she tries her best not to give up hope and live.<br><br> ;_; </br></br></br></br></br>   tfw the new chapter of my waifu's manga is about to come out and I can't concentrate on anything else due to the anticipation   <br><br> Would you go operate innawoods with your waifu? <br><br>Absolutely. I've always wanted to, but have never had the means to do so.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I like the way you think~ <br>For sure.<br><br><br>A week would merely be boring if I had tent, food, etc, but it would be this.<br><br><br>Tenacious, but she falls to pieces if her well laid plans go astray. After her arc though, she learned to depend on people, and I want to be her rock as far as possible.<br><br><br>Both are good, though we'd end up chilling more often than not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> operate innawoods <br>I'm not quite sure what that is (is that a /k/ thing?) but I think we'd rather stay at home. <br><br>I'd say she is. She's had to face a lot that life has thrown at her, and she's still going. It's affected her a lot, but she's still an amazing girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She looks beautiful anon, treasure her well</br>  <br>Unhealthily persistent. After taking pretty serious wounds, she goes in for a rematch and only stops fighting once she gets shot in the ribs.<br><br>It's a love/hate thing about her. It would bother me if she gave up easy and was submissive, but watching her fight so hard for everything is fantastic to see. It just mentally destroys me to see her getting hurt.</br></br></br>  <br>He's surprisingly tenacious, I have to say. Makes me sad people don't give him credit for that; it's definitely one of his best attributes. Makes me proud, in a way, that he has such drive as to volunteer to find Dr. Stein and stop his mother like he did.<br><br><br>Here's the two of them. It's nice to know he has a friend. And even nicer to know he has a lover.  (Me, obviously. Huhuhu) </br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw the first episode of my waifus anime is about to come out </br>  <br> Kurumibro? </br>  <br>Do you feel anxious? I can't even relax right now.</br>  <br> Cripple Shoujo <br> Liking Bacon </br></br>  <br>Great taste, but here is a even healthier girl<br><br>  If you and you're waifu were to go on a fantasy, sci-fi adventure or something such as that along different realms and worlds, what classes would you and you're be? Why would you both pick those classes? <br><br>Since she will always pick the healer class because it's what she does best, I gotta pick something focuses on dealing massive damage, so either Monk or Black Mage</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know much about cars, but I guess something reliable.<br><br><br>I've only just started, but seeing Nepgear in one Gundam show would be pretty cool. Although I hope less suffering.<br><br><br>Average, dense MC so barely got to see a pair of breasts covered by the girls hands.<br><br><br>She couldn't help much at all.<br>But being a bit lovey dovey, trying to get me to do something more fun than just lie in bed or sit in a corner.<br><br><br>I don't, really. I have a hard time with that.<br><br><br>I always end up accidentally scare some sometimes, but I'd avoid doing it with her by any intention.<br><br><br>The latter, with some games thrown in.<br><br><br>Somewhat tenacious, more towards the end of the game.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would rather stay inside, but she would probably wanna operate innawoods. I'm sure we could come to a comprimise, though. She's cool like that.<br><br><br>She is very tenacious, and brave, too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I reread parts of her VN.<br><br><br>I could try, but she doesn't scare easily.<br><br><br>She is incredibily determined when she puts her mind to something. She never gives up easily, and even if she says she gives up, she never truly does.<br><br><br>No bully<br><br>Goodnight waifu thread, I hope you all dream of you're waifu!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Good morning.<br><br><br>No. She's more to me than just "favorite anime girl #1" or some stupid garbage like that.<br><br><br>LN art &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anime character design &gt; manga art, but they're all pretty well done. Manga art is at the bottom but it's not explicitly bad or anything, it's just that the former two, especially the LN art, just works so well.<br><br><br>A hug and some comforting words would be nice.<br><br><br>She does! "Crimson-Haired Ruin Princess", nicknamed so because of her beautiful crimson hair and her magical ability to reduce things to nothing.<br><br><br>Looking at her pictures and hugging her daki close. Listening to her song from the OST is really nice and relaxing too.<br><br><br>I don't know if I COULD scare her without doing something incredibly dangerous. Not to mention her reaction could also be pretty dangerous, given how strong she is.<br><br><br>This one. She looks even more stunning than usual in this picture, in my opinion.<br><br><br>Depends on what we're going into the woods for and whether or not there's a high chance of getting lost. I wouldn't mind it though, a scenic walk through the woods with her sounds wonderful.<br><br><br>Very much tenacious. Once she's decided on a path very few things can deter her from it. Stubborn, spirited, and tenacious.<br><br><br>Good night, Miyakobro.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ok this is my going to be my real last post. See you guys next time. And as always have a great time with your waifus.  Good night, everyone<br>Remember to love her more than anything</br>  <br><br>Goodbye and good night, Sonicbro and anon.</br></br>  <br><br> tfw waifu's new CD is coming out <br>I'm so fucking hyped.  Though I'm extremely sad because I know I won't be able to buy it. <br><br>She's called one of the Queens of Music.<br>Also, a sword, I guess.<br><br>Have a good sleep, Miyakobro.<br><br><br>Good night.<br><br>So many people going to sleep.<br>Is your waifu the type to fall asleep on the couch when she's really tired or is she the type that will walk to the bedroom despite her tiredness just to lie on her comfy bed?<br><br>Tsubasa's the type that might just sleep on the cold concrete because she's tired as hell.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nothing seriously wrong, no. She's a (mischievous) angel!<br><br><br>We were ravenously hungry for one another... we're not the nervous type of couple at all.<br><br><br>Tenacious. She doesn't have the highest Neuroi kill count for nothing!<br><br><br>Erica's outstanding with that kind of thing. She'll keep me company, provide many hugs and kisses, talk it out, crack jokes and try to take my mind off it, often successfully.<br><br><br>Yes, she has two: "Frau" and "Black Devil".<br><br><br>Talk with her, cuddle with her, write about us, view pictures, etc.<br><br><br>I'll only have a bigger fright coming my way in the future, but what the heck? Sure!<br><br><br>This one. It's helped me through some very tough times.<br><br><br>She just falls asleep anywhere - quite often the floor even!<br><br><br><br>Sleep well!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> frau fraietor <br>it rhymes</br></br>  <br> I won't be able to buy it. <br>Is it the money or is it that you don't know how to buy it? Buyfag thread has a guide that could help with that.</br></br>  <br>She doesn't give up when it comes to achieving her dreams. She works hard until she reaches her goal, and I love her for that!<br><br>Definitely walk to her room so she can curl up and get comfy with her Meruru daki.<br><br>Goodnight everyone. I hope everybody has sweet dreams about their beloved.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Either or, I imagine. Sometimes tiredness gets the best of everyone, but I can also see him forcing himself up in spite of it, to lay down somewhere 'proper'. <br><br>Goodnight to everyone who's gone to bed already, I'm going to sleep as well. <br><br>Until next time.</br></br></br></br></br>  I want to see my waifu smile.<br><br><br>For a time she was rather ruthless and violent. She also stole food (as a means to survive). I can't really blame her however considering her circumstances.<br><br><br>Regrettably, I would probably start gawking at her body like a moron; after she gets over the slight embarrassment as well, hopefully she'd snap me out of it. She'd give me a good lookover and put on a brave face, but probably blush like crazy.<br><br><br> Ninja Slayer <br>DOMO, hajimemashite. Sakura Kyouko desu<br><br>That's badass.<br><br><br>I like Ume's original designs a lot, but I'm less positive about the translation to anime format. I like the versions in the various manga adaptations  and fanart  the most.<br><br><br>Absolutely, it'd be adorable. She will definitely get back at me though. Worth!<br><br><br> google that <br> find InnawoodsOperatingWaifu facebook page <br>what in the holy mother of fuck<br><br><br>She'll keep trying even when there's no hope left. I find that aspect of her quite admirable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Both, actually. <br>Maybe I should learn how to buyfag already. Buying her CD will be nice considering our anniversary is 11 days after the CD's release date.</br></br>  <br>As long as it's done moderately buyfagging can be great fun. You should save up if you can and buy it for her. Since our anniversary is coming up next month I'm thinking of buying the complete set of her manga since I only have a digital copy and one volume.</br>    <br>No, you a shit.</br>  You're waifu wants you to dress up in girly clothes and go on a date with her. What do you do?  <br>I'll do anything if it makes her happy.</br>    <br>Go somewhere and imagine her being there with me.<br><br><br> Non Non Biyori <br>She probably forms a band with Nii-chan.<br><br><br> Shion from GJ-bu <br>I would obviously turn her down if she wanted to date me because there's no other way, but I would play chess and other board games with her.<br><br><br>She becomes more serious than she usually is, and shows that she understands my feelings and that she's there to support me. <br><br><br>You could have said "your favorite anime girl (other than you're waifu)".<br><br><br>I just sort of decide to feel close to her and then it happens.<br><br><br>Yes.<br><br><br>Can it be a .gif?<br><br><br>Both are fine with me, she can decide.<br><br><br>Depends. She gives up easily on things she doesn't like doing anyway.<br><br><br>should be obvious, but just to clarify, this wasn't me.<br><br><br>Depends on how girly she means.<br><br>Not posting an image because the limit is pretty close while the bump limit is not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Help her out and make sure she isn't hurt.<br><br><br>Tell her how late it is and that it might be better for her to go to sleep. No problem if she wants to keep watching the videos though.<br><br><br>She has no friends.<br><br><br>We would both rule the kitchen.<br><br><br>She doesn't listen to music - She makes music. And i love her music.<br><br><br>Perfect long.<br><br><br>Us both lying on a green hill doing nothing.<br><br><br>She is the queen of my heart.<br><br><br>A car. And one with a removeable top.<br><br><br>Winter weather i guess.<br><br><br>She somewhat is one of the MCs in her show already.<br><br><br>Not as far as i know.<br><br><br>Depends entirely on the situation.<br><br><br>I like her anime design the most. But the others are nice too.<br><br><br>My folder and her music.<br><br><br>Maybe. Not too spooky though.<br><br><br>There are too many to choose from. I might pic one randomly.<br><br><br>Home sounds nice, safe and comfortable.<br><br><br>She keeps fighting for what she believes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish I could do that.<br>A lot.</br></br>  <br>Nothing.<br><br><br>Anything that came out after the movie looks great, and the best stuff by the regular series designer.<br><br><br>She would listen to what happened and give me a hug. Just her being there would help.<br><br><br>Hug her daki and look at her pictures and figures.<br><br><br>Sometimes. It's a really cute reaction.<br><br><br>Probably this one, seeing her smile would help.<br><br><br>I'd be willing to do the STALKER challenge with her, but it would be dependent on if she wanted to do it. She's not really that much of an outdoors person, but I hope she wouldn't worry about it.<br><br><br>Very tenacious. There were times where she almost stopped gave up, but she pulled through <br>and doesn't do that anymore. She even helps people that feel like they want to give up.<br><br><br>She would get in to bed, like I'm going to.<br>Goodnight. Have dreams about your cute waifus.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good night!</br>  <br>Good night, Fatebro.</br>  <br>I see.<br>I guess I'll start learning and saving then.<br><br>I'll do it for her. Its not like I'm already gay by wearing a girl's clothes.<br>It can also be a plus for us since no one will suspect her if she's seen going out with a girl.<br><br>Have a nice sleep, Fatebro.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Poor desperate anons going crazy about their non existent waifus.  <br>The other mongoloids in my filter list were getting lonely, welcome aboard.</br>  <br>2D&gt;3D in every way though anon</br>  Shinobu husbando if you are still here, which of her key chain/phone straps did you have?<br><br>Just wondering in case my hunting finds the ones you don't have.</br></br>  <br>Haven't had the opportunity.<br><br><br>Not by choice.<br><br><br>Blushing and excitement.<br><br><br>remove yourself<br><br><br>Hugs and kind words.<br><br><br>Hugging, looking and pictures and daydreams.<br><br><br>No.<br><br><br>Make a collage of all the pictures i have.<br><br><br>Yeah, could be fun.<br><br><br>She doesn't give up<br><br><br>To the bed.

Wasn't that line beeped out so heavily you could only hear something Ko******tai~<br>How the hell did fansubbers ever interpret it as Kagami wanting to do something lewd with Konata? What if she just said "I want to bake cookies with Konata~"</br>  <br>Lucky Star thread.<br><br><br> Ko[nata] **** [sh]itai <br>I think. The lewd is mostly implied by the context of the dream and Tsukasa's reaction, I imagine.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that it was just a dream and doesn't mean anything. Kagami might very well not want to ***** with Konata.</br>    <br>Oh please no, it's too fucking early for this.</br>             that skirt   <br>I have no interest in little girls.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jIt<wbr>z-uNjoZA</wbr>  [ ]</br>    That's a skirt alright.

Why is there no western-made anime?  There's this one.  <br><br>And this one?</br></br>  das racis ayy lmao  Do you realize how stupid you sound? <br><br> why is there no japanese cartoons? </br></br>  <br>what is wakfu ?</br>   western-made japanese (read as chinese if you love memes) cartoons   ..and this?   what is Big O S2 <br> what is Oban Star Racers <br> what is IGPX <br> what is fucking Space Dandy <br> what is Dimension W <br>OP is an ignorant faggot as always</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>spongebob?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=JID<wbr>aSDrO3sA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>Animated by studio Mir<br>Studio Mir is Korean<br>Korean != Japanese <br>Fuck me for responding to bait</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh wait wrong video<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1eq<wbr>N2FVyqtc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>How the fuck is Space Dandy western-made?<br> Shinichirō Watanabe <br> Square Enix <br> BONES </br></br></br></br>  <br>anime is mostly animated in korea anyways :^)</br>  <br>What is France is not Japan?</br>  <br>You mean cartoons?</br>  <br>Still done by a Japanese studio, OP's question is just stupid.</br>  <br> Korean != Japanese <br>Come on, anon. We all know it's the same shit.</br></br>  <br>Western funding, like all of those shows.<br>Dense ass motherfucker.</br></br>  <br>Korra was also animated by Studio Pierrot.</br>  <br> anything ever made is American because the global currency is USD <br><br>Give me your fucking address right now, I want to cuck you so fucking badly, YOU FUCK</br></br></br>  <br>Funding something isn't the same as actually making it. That's retard logic.</br>  OP's weird wording aside, the only real answer to the question are shows like Totally Spies, Martin Mystery, Teen Titans or Kappa Mikey to some degree. Although some were French studios, so you can include Wakfu too I guess. But more or less these were all just cartoons with heavy anime influences.  <br>Doesn't count since the French have always been weebs at heart</br>  /a/, what is the most disturbing thing you've ever read/seen in a hentai?  <br>As the other anon said before, were talking about western and developed countries. Directly relating to this case, Japan is at 25 years. I read through the entire list and 35-40 only displayed ~5 times, while 20-25 appeared far more. Also unless you have stats saying othewise for likleyhood of parole relating to life sentences, I would say eligibility for parole is typically granted. Most of the countries with a "never" are middle eastern or african countries.<br><br>Please don't knife me anon, however if you do and I die you'll likely spend 20 years in jail before getting out on parole</br></br></br>  <br>Oh I remember reading this not too long ago.<br>Felt bleak as fuck. Misu Misou isn't too bad either...</br></br>  <br>True<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro<wbr>_L%C3%B3pez_(serial_killer)<br> raped and killed 100-300 lolis <br> released on good behaviour, kek <br>Almost nowhere outside of africa or the islamic world has actual life imprisonment, lots of serial killers get out on parole.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  This is why the world needs the death penalty, damn.  <br>I completely agree with you. We're all fucked up, only in different ways. The only difference is that some fetishes are acceptable whereas others are not. Fapping to guro is no different than fapping to footjobs in terms of the actual impact it has on anyone. So long as people can differentiate between what is fantasy and what is reality, there's no harm in it. It always struck me as being rather hypocritical that people could be really into a certain fetish, like rape, but then condemn some other person's fetish. Yet again, lack of empathy is a symptom of autism.</br>   Toho today posted a 30-second teaser for the upcoming live-action film adaptation of Ore Monogatari!! shoujo manga series, introducing its 15-year-old protagonist Takeo Gouda played by 32-year-old Japanese actor Ryohei Suzuki, best known as Kyosuke Shikijo in HK Hentai Kamen. The film's first poster visual featuring Takeo, his childhood friend Makoto Sunakawa (Kentaro Sakaguchi) and his love interest Rinko Yamato (Mei Nagano) is also revealed. Hayato Kawai (Hanakage, Hachimitsu Drops)-directed film is scheduled to be released in Japan on October 31. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_AM<wbr>jffgf05w</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I guess Ore Monogatari is doing great in Japan, not in /a/.</br></br></br></br>   best grill looks like a whore <br> best bro looks like a normie jap tryhard <br> MC doesn't like nothing like in the anime <br><br>0/10 japan, quit doing 3DPG fucking movies</br></br></br></br>  that acting looks shit tbh, but i guess is ok since portray Takeo's reactions must be impossible, however i can't do but get cringe at watching that on 3dp  <br>Yeah, doing so great that the anime is selling like shit.</br>  Starting with something easy      Easy one.    <br>Bakuman?</br></blockquote>]
