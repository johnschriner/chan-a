Three years ago, the world learned that harpies, centaurs, catgirls, and all manners of fabulous creatures are not merely fiction; they are flesh and blood—not to mention scale, feather, horn, and fang. Thanks to the "Cultural Exchange Between Species Act," these once-mythical creatures have assimilated into society, or at least, they're trying.  When a hapless human teenager named Kurusu Kimihito is inducted as a "volunteer" into the government exchange program, his world is turned upside down. A snake-like lamia named Miia comes to live with him, and it is Kurusu's job to take care of her and make sure she integrates into his everyday life. Unfortunately for Kurusu, Miia is undeniably sexy, and the law against interspecies breeding is very strict. Even worse, when a ravishing centaur girl and a flirtatious harpy move in, what's a full-blooded teenage human with raging hormones to do?!

Diana Divine, Ukraine, and Kira Buckland are the best    If you niggas are on here, hello             Why couldn't Koichi keep his hair perma-Super Saiyan? Looked so much better than his shitty flat top.       The Gucci art still gets to me with Bruno and Jolyne. Still wish those art pieces that were done as fronts for Gucci stores was made into some artbooks or something. Unless they where and I didn't look hard enough.     Jonathan where are your gains    I don't know, I think it's kind of cute.   Post yfw  I'LL BE THE ROUUUUUUNNDDDABOOOOUUUUUT       Post yfw  Let's not.      mfw I'm reading the manga in another tab and I just got to this scene less than a minute before you posted it      Sorry, this is what I meant to post.       Well really, I think the last thread was deleted mainly because it was inciting no discussion. This one is. So maybe it was a warning of such. If you want these threads to survive post responsibly I guess.    I thought we already did this. I know Bloody Stream was done but not sure about the others.         Araki's new art gave him a terminal disease.      Giorno, chairs don't just work like that   no neck scar      how would win in a fight, GER or Demonbane   Could be Awakened Dio?      I never really got why Araki decided to draw Alessi in drag (or whatever that is that gets used for one of his victory animations).    This and the HD background you're given on the PSN copy is great. I wish ASB got the same treatment of current-style-Araki for the cover.   I don't think Araki did any illustrations for ASB. Shame really.      It's his younger form      that World   It's like it lost any sense of danger to it, especially in SBR.      There's something really cool about Gappy on a car hood.  hurdur dubs   Demonbane because GER counts as being an aspect of it. Also, GER is not that broken at all. Or rather, it maybe is, but we don't know for sure. Talking about GER powerlevels is like talking about 2hu pwoerlevels, it's stupid and best not to do it.    Cover for a novel about Part 4.   I hope he keeps the Lambo he just won.    Koichi got a bad case of the uglies     Koichi's face    What are the chances of part 4 anime being made?   60-70%     buy muh BDs  Depends     Pretty high probably. How have the BDs been selling?    Pretty much  v3 of Egypt came out today and it's selling pretty well. 10k average is considered decent. We'll likely get the TBC arrow at the end of BDv6 and then the official announcement at Jump Festa in December.   Sup  Gay Priest is here now.    tfw bought all of the Jojoniums and didn't get the poster with the last volume.     Avdol looking pretty gay.     everything looks different   except The Fool   Oh well, at least Araki remembered that Polnareff has no eyebrows this time.      Who's rewatching the blurays   Quick, we must recite the 14 phrases. I'll start. Rasen Kaidan      Koichi later died of a cold     Kabutomushi    Haikyo no Machi    Kakyoin (unsurprisingly) got affected the least other than the Fool and Heirophant, but his lips look off there. Kinda looks like a monkey.    Not as gay as Polnareff.    Jesus, no. ASB's jp cover was great.     That Star Platinum   No ORA here.     How is JoJo so referenceable  Please uncover Araki's secret     Magician's Red looks high as fuck    The levels of fabulous and over the top.    Poses can make any panel memorable.

Pick a plot, any plot. Jojo did it first. Titanic? Jojo did it first. Guile? Stroheim sees your family man and raises you GERMAN SCIENCE. Broken-ass timestopping powers? They all wish they could match up to DIO. Personas? We all know they're just lousy rip-offs of Stands.   Can Zappa be a honorary Jojo?   His name is a music reference and he dresses weird. That's good enough for me    Did Jonathan do being a Kenshiro ripoff first?   Man, not to make a blog post, but I'm so glad I found JoJo in late 2014. I normally kind of hate anime/manga but this is so perfect. JoJo is just so, what it is. It's so honest. JoJo is extremely eccentric but doesn't have the slightest bit of irony in its execution. It's strange but not in a modern way self-aware way, it's absolutely earnest. It's just so pure, like this is what you get when an eccentric writes something for 30 years and I love it.  I'm currently reading Part 8 and man it's so good.     All money on JoJo.    He did Kenshiro: Vampire Hunter first.    Starting now with:  Joseph Joestar vs Josuke Higashikata (8)     New chapter when    heart headband   his seizures are just him cycling through JoJo poses   his best ghost is Star Platinum   the series has a ton of other JoJo references   sure. He better be in Xrd soon. Faust isn't enough.         johhny will probably win because Ai can into short characters but hoping for the gio or jolyne win     Is this supposed to be Soft &amp; Wets early design or is it the other stand Killer Queen fused with?    That's always my favorite way to describe why I love Jojo so much too. There are a lot of silly series's out there, but no series is as silly as Jojo while taking itself completely seriously.    This. Not only that, it also has a very palpable epic (in the actual sense of the word) feel. The many generatios of Joestars, their many different enemies and friends, the many different plots. It's very powerful when you think about all of it.    It's S&amp;W's early design. It took him a while to show up.    About another week perhaps. The group hasn;t gotten the scans yet apparently.    32 ips   95 posts   "edition" in the OP   Time to let the series die, guys. Move on. I suggest Boruto threads.       2/10  Please move on to shitposting in Naruto or other generic shounen threads  Last reply        It's early in the day. These threads usually get busy later on. About 8pm GMT onwards.    Gappy looks so much more buff here. I wish he wasn't such a skinny faggot.    Isn't five fucking stands a bit too much?   new chapter when  The way they ended the s1 episodes like that were money. They shoulda kept doin it with other songs or somethin    In one of my more pretentious and wordy moments, I described Jojo like this: "No matter how kooky the adventures get in JoJo, it's always respectful of the human spirit." It definitely is "epic." It's a story spanning hundreds of years and two universes, yet it's full of characters that, despite being cartoons, feel absolutely human.     Zappa Villian of part 8 when     They all look pretty gay to be honest    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=g0L<wbr>vHu-dZr8</wbr>  [ ]  I kinda wish someone bothered to sub this.    I'm rereading Phantom Blood and just realized Dio is reading Gorgeous Irene  Infinity &gt; Zero confirmed    No offense, But Jo2suke is a black guy, He just look too black for me.      DIO used to have dark hair   So did Giorno      This is probably due to the fact that Araki does Jin Yong style characterization. Jin Yong is a super famous Chinese Wuxia author, and one of his trademarks is giving stories to pretty much every named character that appears. On top of giving them backstories, he doesn't feel the need to write extremely complex characters and instead tries to make them all striking, whether they are 1-dimensional or multi-dimensional. And it works. Araki pretty much does the exact same thing, just to a lesser extent because we don't have biographies of every character. But the effect is still the same, it just works.   Launching mass Villain tournament! Johnny won the JoJos.  See   Bracket: http://challonge.com/WTBVIllainASB        Gappy isn't black, he doesn't like fried chicken at all. Don't you dare force your Tumblr-tier headcanons onto him.  On another note, why are there so many Josukes running around nowadays? Is he still Araki's number 1?       tournaments with JoJo ASB   it's like the one fighting game you don't use for tournaments      He's actually just Pinecone with slightly larger lips    I'm pretty sure it's a CPU vs CPU thing.    Johnny won the last one as well. This is suspicious.     Wow, I just say that He look like a black guy.     Frankly, Josuke could be three different races with people noticing it.         Bracket reset to accommodate Vanilla Ice.     I'm not seeing it really. Just a dude in a sailor suit with a gap in his teeth.      I just say that He look like a black guy   "No offense, but Jo2suke is a black guy"   RACIST      Made this just now.   Take away the suit and there's not even a slight resemblance to how he looks past the first few chapters.      This is good besides Koichi    Are you saying that God looks like a black guy?    Well yeah Araki isn't going to copy someone 100%. His art changes through a part and characters look different than how they looked before. I'd say the overall resemblance is still there though.     Not noticing Josuke's hipbones     He's always had wide hips    I don't know, I've seen many guesses for possible inspiration that feel closer to the end result to me.    That's what that beaner said, silly.    Josuke's hipbones   Please stop, I have a thing for hipbones.         Giorno has dark hair because he was created using Johnathan's cock and DNA.    The actual face design isn't based on pinecone for sure (he's not Japanese after all), but I'm pretty sure the overall look was based on him. Sailor uniform+hat+gap teeth isn't exactly a common combination.    Take away the suit and almost every one of Araki's characters are blank slates    mfw no Part 4   It's ogre.     The best part is that the colorists tried to color his black hair blonde.   Nepnep 2 when?   Not if you don't take away the hair.    I meant Pynchon there but the other anon could be right about the gap and uniform combination.    It's not like it didn't take MONTHS for an official announcement of Part 3 to arrive right     That everything   My DIIIICKKKK, JOSHUA JOESTAR SAVE ME Sauce       I refuse to believe that thing is organic    I want to run my fingers through it during sex.     It's probably all crusty from layers of hairspray and pomade.     I don't feel as if I'm being deterred from wanting to have sex with him.   Post your favourite JoJo analogies.   "It's like having an icicle up the ass!"      I read that as  Looking for a man that will change o&lt;&gt;one so I can rub my goopy vagina across my kitchen floor and pretend I'm a snail.         reading is hard...     You can read posts on these threads, can't you? Don't be a lazy faggot.     More Art!  Give me some good JoJo videos   So you watch dubs?

Also adding to the question        You just wasted a minute of my life.  Good job.       18:08:54      Johnny won the JoJos  Sasuga crippleman    Should i skip Part 5 since there are no good translations?   Walk on to bus   See this   What do?      no      Join the gang, develop a stand, develop a fashion sense.    Insert fingers into donut hair    Stop Fugo from raping the girl.    Drop a beat and start dancing   I'm reading part 7 and I think sometimes Araki forgets that Johnny can't walk. The way he easily moves around is not something he could do crawling.  What battle is this most like?   The spin doesn't have to explain shit.    DIO's World was full of weird ones.  As sure as you'll belch after drinking cola   like a student scrambling to finish an exam   like an icicle up the ass   rat shit in a bathroom   dog shit on a road          Silver Chariot Requiem Alternatively any fight with Joseph.     Call Mista a faggot.    It's actually possible for one to be paralyzed from knees down but it was probably just the combination of Araki not giving a fuck and just wanting it to look cool.    i think it's just his lower legs that are crippled     All of those and you didn't remember "as sure as getting your pants wet when you piss in the wind"?    Was Giorno affected by Pucci's time resting? Or is he and Emporio the only two walking around in the SBR universe with memories of the previous universe?   Johnny handstands everywhere offscreen  But yea that was probably the worst thing about an otherwise great Part. Johnny's disability felt meaningless.      there's probably a few more too      He run away from dinosaur and jumped off horses like it was something possible to do without healthy legs. Plus, he got shot on the spine, so he is probably dead from the waist down.      We don't know, we don't even know if the old universe has actually stopped existing and we don't know if the universe shown at the end of SO is the same as the SBR universe or not.    W-why Joseph hugging Jotaro like that? It's looks so wrong lol.    Hol Horse comes out victorious! Even coming so far as to destroy Johnny in a faceoff!  Up next: DUWANG (Kira) vs Hol Horse Best BroJo championship         It is kind of ruining it for me, every story arc all I can think about is "how the fuck are you doing this? How did you even got there without your horse or wheelchair? How the fuck are you running away from those guys? How did you get up there?"     how the fuck are you doing this?   upper body strength  How did you even got there without your horse or wheelchair?   upper body strength   How the fuck are you running away from those guys?   upper body strength  How did you get up there?  upper body strength           It's the power of 「hunger」    DUWANG lost to hol   I cried.     That star platinum   WE'VE CLEARLY PASSED THE POINT OF ORA  In other news, why can't Araki just draw part 1-4 using his old works as inspiration? Has he literally forgot how to draw Kenshiro style?        Do not worry, we are competing in his house at the moment.  BroJo tournament now!      He probably just doesn't want to.    he said in jojonium that he can but likes his current style better   Can you guys stop being mean to the animefags, they keep retreating and making shitty threads on /v/ and I'm getting REALLY annoyed, OK?    Hard to say, looking into Jojo 6251 where Araki covers Parts 1-4 it has a particular thing about it that could explain why he has difficulty recreating it when you compare the newer art.   Also any NY anons in this thread you can find sealed copies of Jojo 6251 over at Bookoff in midtown.        (44 KB, 444x444)    So is Karera a rock or not? She references a pillarman but so does Jobin and it's pretty obvious he's not one of them.  Why isn't all the colored manga completely translated? How hard is it to copy and paste over some text?   Finding the time to do that is hard.    I just realized Viper was a rapper, holy fuck I thought "Viper, Kill yourself my man" was just some random ghetto dude standing in front of a mirror telling some deviantart user named viper to kill himself. What the fuck, now you're telling me its the art for a fucking album? What the fucking shit.     what's the matter, 2hood4u?   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=15h<wbr>NXNQzzMI</wbr>  [ ] what the fuck is this    He releases like a dozen albums a week. Every single cover is like that.    We need to make more viper album edits.    I feel like her wearing a swimsuit under her outfit and a fish-print bandana implies she's not a rockman what with their only dying in water and shit.    Requesting a Za Warldo edit of this one.    Yeah but you'd think at least one JoJofag could do it. I just wanna read the colored manga man, looks so fucking nice.   I could but i'm a lazy fag too lmao       That's not even an exaggeration.He also tried to sell me Real Estate on twitter once.     jojo fanbase    Did DIO know that C-Moon/MiH involved gravity, or was the "Do you believe in gravity" a coincidence?    Hol Horse confirmed for best Jojo villain     Come on, they're just a couple of kids. They seem to have fun talking about JoJo too, give them a break.     I'm a legit fan of him.Not even ironically.That shit's chill AF.It's like a weird mix of vaporwave and rap.I can't really explain it.He makes all his music himself too.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v<wbr>=qmFCxp_pk7g</wbr>   So here's the last one, Doc.   And Kira who she's together with on the photo is a ship doctor. I'm reminded of that "man of the sea/man of the land" thing he told Sasame. A rock man is a man of the land    I love it,it's my favorite.     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipe<wbr>r_(rapper)</wbr>   Style   tfw this is real       If he wasn't such a coward he would have killed the crusaders.  He could control bullets. I doubt Jotaro himself could do much against him if Star Platinum can't predict the bullet's trajectory.     WHERE'S THE NEW FUCKING CHAPTER       So when are these getting Part 8 Stands?        Well if it weren't for whining fans he would've had the first protagonist tag team kill.   『BREAK BREAD BRO』  『F*CK SEAGULLS』  『ANAL D1LDOES』   These are real albums.      SUTANDO POWAH   How much songs has VIPER created?    How is it obvious that he isn't one of them? You know literally nothing about rockmen other than that they can turn into rocks. By what logic can't Jobin be one?   Wow they fucked up Crusaders ending bad, I mean giving Vanilla Ice and Mariah what, three or four episodes, while DIO gets two?   Also, when is Part 4 getting animated? And will we ever see SBR?      Yo Wife F*cked Me &amp; Fell in Luv   It'd Be Heaven On Earth If Cops Were Drafted &amp; Not Hired   I Am The King U Work At Dominos Pizza   Deala of Dope   F#ck U Pussies   Fuck U Little Nigger   The Top-Choice Assassin   F%ck Ur Wedding Walkin' Dead Man   Pure Stuntin'   God Hates U and Luvs Me   Eternal Prettyboy   Evil 2   I Beat Off with Shark Teeth   I Beat Off with Shark Teeth Volume 6 (Fuck Them Otha Volumez)  All these albums sound like something DIO would've written if he was born in the 20th century ghetto and the list goes on.                  I think it's much more likely it was because of the editors and not the fans. The guy didn't really have much going for him before his first death. All his memorable moments happen after e comes back.    Giorno and SBR flags are fucked. The images aren't supposed to be rotated like that Araki. You could even do it for the other flags.     Callin' Yo Main Bitch Wit A Nokia   Sellin Real Estate To Yo Main Bitch   I Take It In The Butt Better Than Yo Main Bitch   If all of these aren't Part 8 stands meant to fuck with Gappy and Yasuho then Araki has failed.         I would be very surprised if the number was not in the 5-digit range.

He was born with it and he couldn't even go to school because of it, let alone make a family and become a successful businessman while keeping it a secret from even his own father and son.  That being said the rockmen are surely related to the rock disease somehow so who knows.            Closing scene of Episode 48 with Roundabout playing where?      Ya, but even if he (and Karera) are not rocks themselves, I'm sure that they're both deeply involved in the rockman cause.        Very late reply, but mostly to HotF because that game basically started the anime fighter genre. Eddie has one of Jotaro's leaning winposes and is basically a Stand user. Sol Badguy has a bunch of Jotaro's animations, his exact standing pose and says "Yare yare daze." Johnny also has a bunch of Jotaro's animations from HotF. And yea, Zappa is just a ton of JoJo references rolled into a character, most notably his walking animation is identical to DIO's.  JoJo was incredibly influential and has a lot to do with the direction manga in general took. In the same way, HotF was one of the first real anime fighters and it had a ton of influence. Darkstalkers and X-Men COTA were some years earlier but JoJo arguable shaped the genre more.      why jojo is in space?     <br/>   Stone free lookin like the 3rd member of Daft Punk    You haven't read Part 6 have you?   Jolyne and Weather Report fight a stand user who can cancel out gravity in a certain area. Eventually this causes the oxygen to drain away as well. WR constructs two space suits out of ...air? Condensed clouds? Something like that.      I fucked up on cleaning this one because I started laughing throughout the edit.    Because it's  「Dancing Queen」      It wouldn't be Viper if you had done a good job.     Why hasn't JoJo in space yet?  Stand-users in space-station orbiting Mars, with returning appearance from Dio, once again.      Saved Thank you based anon.       Because the 36 Karses would take over the plot.     It's beautiful.    where can i get gappy's underwear    Holy Kek.    Damn right he would.     implying Arabia Fats with The Sun requiem wouldn't just crash the sun into them     Gappy.     Pio means Chirp in Italian  FUCK  Also does anyone have the ripped sound of the world stopping time?        The Sun requiem   not being a Black Hole     So, SBRKira and SBRHair were actually friends? Whoa.    Arabia controls every star in the universe   not even GER can set that many stars to zero      Relatives even.     what is shading  Going by that logic, every animu/manga character should have black or white hair     GER can't set stars to zero because stars have no will. If you're able to act without will, GER becomes powerless (though he can still punch you).     I'll defeat you with my stand「I Hate Niggers」!    I still hope we'll see Irene.     bring all stars on collision course with earth   stop arabia fats will   but not the stars       Lovecraft pls.    Removing the Arabia Fats part this would actually be a really good plot for a manga.   Does Sex Pistols have any advantages over Emperor?At all?   no.    But it can set actions to zero and completely nullify the effect.    Well, you should kill yourself if you think reading is hard The only thing that puts me off of reading manga is the lack of colors    http://exhentai.org/g/826867/2f00fb<wbr>702d/  Thread soundtrack: https://soundcloud.com/4chan-guitar<wbr>-whore/fascination-1</wbr>  </wbr>  http://exhentai.org/g/821432/74fa1c<wbr>f76d/ http://exhentai.org/g/816674/a24cb1<wbr>d9c1/ http://exhentai.org/g/801279/820911<wbr>5718/ http://exhentai.org/g/573592/5d154a<wbr>1bd7/</wbr> </wbr> </wbr> </wbr>   Daily reminder: ビッチ= Bitch and not Slut.

Bitch should be slut unless you want to go for TL notes and it's not worth it unless it's in the title or something.  "You bitch" is different from "you slut", bitch in English also implies asshole or wuss.       Bitch should be slut unless you want to go for TL notes and it's not worth it unless it's in the title or something.   Taking translating as something absolute in all cases is stupid. It's all about the context, you could/should use slut in a lot of the cases but you can't just say it should always be done. Sometimes bitch is the correct answer (she's my bitch, bitch in heat).      does anyone know if Morino Kasumi is a new artist? because HOLY SHIT is their work good.

No. Last time I bought the raw I need to translate, it was from my own pocket. I did that because I like the artist, and it's a KoF doujin no one bothered to buy.

That was changed a few months back. Prices are the same now.    Wow, you're actually right.    A text based game that people use for money that give them privileges or some shit, fuck man even I don't play the game but I know that shit.

No wonder the artstyle looked familiar.      tfw poor  I've been expending a lot on bounties recently though    Is the dump over?  Onee-chan or imouto?   We did it, reddit!    You don't need to be from reddit to recognize a cunt.     You don't even know the story, which admittedly the anime did a poor job of conveying but clearly you wouldn't care even if you didn't know.  Also if Sora was always perfect there would be no room for the character development that happens in the various routes.       Not commenting on &gt;streaming  Not being cheerful isn't the same of being spoiled, and you certainly wouldn't be cheerful after selling your home to survive since you have no income just after your parents died and you have to live in the country with nothing you enjoy as a city person because it's cheaper.  And no, Haruka isn't exactly being nice to her, just being polite. He doesn't trust her so he took everything on him and is treating her as a liability, which is the whole main issue with the story leading to her being afraid of being left alone and believing that she is a burden and that he is better without her.         Haru really isn't treating her so much as a liability and more as someone who can't take care of herself and be trusted to make any decisions out of a desire to "protect" her which only succeeds in making her think he thinks she's a liability.   You're adding more ill-intent to Haru's actions than was there.      ITT: We post a studio's best work.  That's not Ocean Waves.   inb4 muh SZS  Nope. Fuck that boring shit.

I like the twang of it. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=fdj<wbr>ZtaDepfA</wbr>  [ ]      This fucking song: http://a.uguu.se/paypho_23kid%2CIli<wbr>kequartet.flac The original vocal is kinda shit though. </wbr>     One of those rare full OP.    *good full OP Fuck me.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lU9<wbr>rOBO2Q4o</wbr>  [ ] Can't believe this hasn't been posted yet One of my all time favorites    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wPK<wbr>KEu80hfY</wbr>  [ ]  ALL THE QUARTETS WILL LEAD TO THE LALALALA LALALALA LA    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Jwh<wbr>jqdSPw5g</wbr>  [ ]   I hate carnival phantasm, and i hate this.

They were pretty cool.    time is in the URL but im too dumb to get it to work on 4chin    God damn it this show could make me go from disgusted to erect in a matter of seconds Might have to go rewatch it     Thank you for reminding me to watch this anon.    Dunno Consider reading the novel, it's pretty cute about half the time but the narrative also runs really deep and dark. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=k0g<wbr>1WQHdlB0</wbr>  [ ]     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nsi<wbr>_gBdRdt4</wbr>  [ ]  Lucky Star   Rolling Star is GOAT.

Sadly, I just with they put more effort animating it  https://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ORsbH<wbr>Ak4Mx4</wbr>  [ ]     One of these I'm going to look up the Fate series and figure out how all this different shit exist so it's not so damn confusing.    OH SHIT   How the fuck could I have forgotten about fucking Kyouran Kazoku Nikki. Damn this makes me wonder how many other shows I forgot I watched.     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GbY<wbr>cTIAVnVY</wbr>  [ ]  Mell-sama at her prime.    I know how the board feels about Fairy Tail, but I'll be damned if their OP's and ED's aren't catchy as all fuck.

How was the show? I've been getting more into watching/reading some shoujo lately but I skipped that one when it was airing.      Favorite TQ OP. They are all great, but this one is best I think.    I'm honestly kind of sad no one's mentioned this amazing one.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=liO<wbr>hvcscXmU</wbr>  [ ]      The music     not anime...   No one even bothered posting top 3 SZS op. No wonder, it's pretty hard to find them. I'll just post last op.  s://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rhx-qWD<wbr>MGyo</wbr>  [ ]     Rejoice, next season has more durarara.    I support.   NOT A SINGLE EUREKA SEVEN OPENING.

The first ED was catchy as hell too.     Of course    This really has to be one of the comfiest OPs ever made.    Yeah, I still listen to this one. Had the cd single    Das it mane   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=JK_<wbr>v5zyxZu4</wbr>  [ ]  What is wrong with all of you?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tg8<wbr>Jahz6RM4</wbr>  [ ]     yus    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7EZ<wbr>ABDpHeyk</wbr>  [ ]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=alR<wbr>P32ZHv3o</wbr>  [ ]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=b16<wbr>zTWwpHWk</wbr>  [ ]         You cannot go wrong with MOSAIC.WAV  Pretty much  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=niJ<wbr>dV4QUFaU</wbr>  [ ]       it does have a nice twang doesn't it    SK made the OP? Heh, didn't knew about it.   ottodokkoi https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9vT<wbr>tsLfyCkc</wbr>  [ ]   Catchy openings and nobody posts the true god-tier.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=H8W<wbr>7eF49xv4</wbr>  [ ]    Hopefully you'll all not judge based on the first couple and will listen to all of them.

Not including ED's. Shit taste detected.  (Caution, before watching this, please consider not skipping ahead, let the song build up) https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3Fa<wbr>ZbTB_oOw</wbr>  [ ]                        Can anyone find that last ED from the final Sayonara zetsubo sensei? The one where Sensei is chained up in an attic and he's some kind of monster, and the ED has shots of all the students in shaded colors as they bob their heads up and down and left to right to the rhythem, and that one bald student has a flash of lightning show his skeleton etc etc.  I think it's Zan or Zoku SZS ED 2. I can't find it on youtube anymore.     YESSSSSSSSS. MUROMI-SAN'S OP IS GODLY.   I don't give a fuck what any of you say, https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ioa<wbr>YuQxRxKo</wbr>  [ ] is one of the sickest anime OP's I've ever heard.

The god of all openings. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4WQ<wbr>zmAk6Zi4</wbr>  [ ] ServantxService was such a fucking good show. Shame nobody talks about it anymore after it got done airing. Cowlick and Cowtits was best girl.

It's the best thing out of all Type Moon bullshit  after Melty Blood    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=05z<wbr>3kNhpURI</wbr>  [ ] Iga clan a shit.     WCW ED.   It's not quite often you see good taste from mongrels on /a/, but I suppose it'll happen from time to time.      Actually, fucking yeah, someone shockingly posted it somewhere I believe.   Listened to this one every time. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vRg<wbr>pr7HLa_c</wbr>  [ ]  Air guitar intensifies.     Nichijou second OP is really fun. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mUz<wbr>NLayMrJk</wbr>  [ ]   No Saki??!? Blasphemy.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=B4A<wbr>vTgPtNxM</wbr>  [ ]     If you're talking about the fact that it's a PV and not the official OP, that's primarily because there's no unedited version of it available on youtube at the moment, however, if you're saying I'm dumb because of who I think the best girl is?, then you have shit taste if you like anyone else, faggot.   If you're calling me dumb because I said it's not talked about, and you're about to use the &gt;newfag or "it was talked about plenty when it aired" argument, then you're a fucking retard who's probably new as shit and should shut the fuck up. It gets little to no discussion on /a/. Period. I was in almost every single SxS thread, what little amount there were, even - when it was airing, so I'm unsure of what the fuck you're even talking about, you seem like the bigger retard here for simply calling me dumb and not offering a legitimate reason as to why.      awesomeness.   Tsukikage ran, enjoyed her swordplay.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-ns<wbr>vlxoqUYs</wbr>  [ ]     loved this series.    very underrated post but what else to expect from neo-/a/    https://<span>youtu.be/AsVCIF7o_go  [ ]    the   nonexistent  S2's OP  not the S1   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kpa<wbr>jJi5yBsM</wbr>  [ ]      I still hear my office mate humming this intro https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=uAR<wbr>n2MCUZN4</wbr>  [ ]      Sono Chi no Sadame is the only catchy one. The rest are solid though.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YGB<wbr>w4uCZ4hA</wbr>  [ ]  There are people in this thread right now who don't want to have a pure time.     jesus why, I can't get this out of my head    Kuusou Rumba rap &gt; all     Hehe     Holy fuck there's actually an anime OP using enka     It's been two years  Fuck me.     I agree. One of the few shows (along with Bake and Paranoia Agent) I don't immediately quit before the ED.

Not to say it's a bad OP, but the melody uses less than common rhythms and the song overall is more a less a jumble of melodies.

I remember watching the original series and thought it was pretty cool but never watched the second series.   Bump   YOU MADE A GOOD CHOICE!  Part 2 will leave you in such butthurt that watching the part 3 pv will only rub salt in your wounds.       Who are we kidding? We all know it will be shit.  will mc get cucked again?   Don't waste your time with evol, it's just women fucking dogs.    is mari okada helping write it?       MC is actually a dog who cucked it's master   I still don't know why are you all as butthurt as that gay angel.        12,000 years we've waited for this..    No, its being done by the guy in charge of The Marie Show and Psycho Pass 2. Now you're probably wishing it was Okada.     Because Zessica got absolutely nothing for her efforts  and Mikono was written as useless as possible and never allowed to do ANYTHING AT ALL until the last episode asspullorama    No OSORE, why bother.   Both of those shows were passable.    Okada is awesome when she's not trying to sound smart.     Because Zessica got absolutely nothing for her efforts   Well she IS a side character. Main girls always win no matter what.      They got rid of all of Zessica's charms for the "reincarnation". Watch is probably the other girl that he reincarnation that became like that to copy Mikono.     Main girl was ranked behind background girls with no lines.      Psycho-Pass 2   passable      I had fun watching it. I don't quite get why people hate it so much.  It wasn't anything awesome though.      Great way to ignore that everyone fucking hated the main girl and even other writers suggested letting Zessica win instead. Kawamori was the only one pushing for Mikono.     even other writers suggested letting Zessica win instead.   Sauce on this?      Best Girl on the right detected.     Because Zessica got absolutely nothing for her efforts  Wrong. Her character design was reused in the sequel for the winning girl.     So she's not the main girl after 12000 years?     not  now*     EVOL looked better, good music, fun characters, some good episodes. But overall it's not as good as the original.     Her character design was reused   Derp eyes   No Tan   Derp Face  How is this winning?       Goddamn it, every Aquarion is so fucking horrible, but I can't stop watching it.   Okada and the voice actors liked Zessica better and wanted her to win. And Okada actually wanted to write Kagura and Mikono to be together so Amata and Zessica would be paired up.  Kawamori said no.     Behold your new king.    Aquarion: Potato edition     Looks like the design of a losing girl tbh   The MC is so fucking ugly, I wouldn't mind if the other guy gets the new Zessica.   He's the friendzoned childhood friend, he won't win.    What a nice cat.    Alpaca.     Cute cat.     Mikono didn't do anything, not even in the last episode because Amata and Kagura didn't let her.   Can't wait to watch every episode of this piece of shit series and then rage on /a/ again.    All of it anon. ALL THAT EMOTION is just preparation for Macross Delta.     Just reading this post reminded me how butthurt I am about zessica pretty much being discarded and nobody in universe actually giving a single fuck.    inb4 she loses all over again..  eternal suffering bless they anons     I like how they're going for the zessica route for this shit now, a little too late in my opinion   http://aqlogos.com/mechanic-aquario<wbr>n/</wbr>    It wasn't because of that. It's because most off the staff were KaguraxMikono fags. Kawamori even joked about how everyone thought Mikono and Amata holding hands was kind of gross but they thought Kagura licking her was cute    Jesus christ I can't watch this.  They all look so weird.  And that motherfucking, goddamned, faggot-ass haircut. Nope. I won't do it.       Yes you will.     you can no longer protect her smile because it is gone forever  I didn't even watch this show and I'm mad she lost.     Not really digging the designs.   So those two are the main couple in this one?   In before that's not Zessica.    Zessica was always a side character, Okada just got side-tracked by Zessica suffering and so focused on that.   It was actually the female staff, they loved the whole bad boy shtick, and fangirling over him hard.      How can Aquarion be a franchise if the first series wasn't even that good? In what way is it marketable. EVOL was fun because it was campy, but it is actually forgettable. The only decent things coming from Aquarion are the soundtracks. What are they trying to achieve by extending the franchise?    Obviously.       It happens because Kawamori can afford it for his own entertainment. It's just like modern Nintendo's direction.    He's not even involved in Logos, he's too busy with Macross.    It's not even an Akino opening.      Mark my words it would be triangle. Since they are loosing words, they have lost the 3rd pilot too. The 1st half of anime would be about finding that 3rd pilot.    The one that we call Zessica is going to be Touma and MC is going to be Apollonius/Gen/Zen.     Kawamori can afford it for his own entertainment  that only apply for the plays of nobunaga the fool, aquarion continuation is more related to pachiko than kawamori     Wait, Not Mikono has 3 ponytails.   I think that something is wrong with Touma/Zessica/s design.   I can't get over those shitty designs    Something about that looks really off.      How can the character designer creat a male whith such hair and don't think it looked retarded?     BARK     If you have noticed, all characters hair have that bowl on their head.    It might be Shushu.     What if she's actually the dog this time?     She looks wrong in that one.    If you mean previous generation loser then probably.     somebody was paid real life money for these character design     She looks wong in that one.    She did this and something something 12000 YEAR A I SHI TER U.   So I was confused, The first series and evols commander, were they the same person or the same person reincarnated. Like was he immortal or nah.  Also best op https://<span>youtu.be/ltebZspkp_g  [ ] inb4 shit quality i know       He's Acala from Bhuddism, AKA The Immovable, AKA Fudō-myōō.    He is Apollonius who has never died.    If hes acala from buddism his left eye being gone/closed makes alot more sense lol.      Doesnt someone reincarnate from apollonius, if they did, how does someone reincarnate from him if hes not dead?    Only Apollo has reincarnated. Apollo is the dog of Apollonius.                        The last dog made me laugh.                      Well we all know who will get cuckold. Poor girl on the right she even looks like best girl.        Of course. Boring MC must get together with boring heroine.        Is that MC a poor man alto? It feels they are trying to copy macross frontier at this point.     Worst parents ever.     Are they playing with scissors here?    those Zessica/Mix doujins where they get drugged and body modified   this is completely and utterly my fetish                          which ones are those?     http://exhentai.org/g/524518/557916<wbr>26b7/ http://exhentai.org/g/524520/50001b<wbr>c217/</wbr> </wbr>    May'n instead of Akino   Jouji Nakata as next Gen  I'm confused     Maybe they swapped places for Macross singing.   Why?    As long as there's a few insert songs somewhere in there sung by Akino. But it still doesn't feel right.      I like both Ubukuta and Okada, whatever.      someone post my art  good times      Kawamori said he was Zeus. Fitting for him.   Nah, man, Kawamori made a boring yet beautiful female character his waifu and helped ruin everything. Is common knowledge by now.           . EVOL was fun     Common knowledge that's really isn't true.  The staff all knew from day one that Mikono was the main character, but they got distracted and ended up too busy fanboying/girling over their own favorite characters. And Okada has admitted that she got distracted with Zessica suffering.   EVOL was doomed from failure.        Zessica suffering shouldn't equal Mikono being shit. For all I care, Zessica could be raped by Mykage and that still isn't an excuse for Mikono being a shit heroine.  Are you that one idiot that keeps defending Kawamori in every thread? Not even the japanese do this shit, they all agree him and Okada ruined evol.      Aquarion threads will be forever plagued with the buttblasted zessicafags.    I know that Zessicafags don't like to be told this but, Zessica was never supposed to be important. Okada got distracted by Zessica melodrama and focused on her, when she could have spent that time doing other shit. Okada had the full power to change Mikono if she wanted to but chose not to.  Kawamori fucked up, but his fuck up was not bringing in an all new staff and not bringing in one of the major staff members from Sousei so that they could get a handle on the new staff members faggotry.      Okada is great.  No Yoko Kanno, no Okada, no Akino and shitty studio plus alzheimer Kawamori means this will be shit.       This shit taste.   Okada is well known for her penchant for needless melodrama and getting distracted.      Male MC is reincarnation of Mikono. Zessica is Zessica. Fluffy volumetric hair is reincarnation of EVOL MC. The host club male in jacket is merging of Piano Cancer and GAR kun.  After 12000 years true love will finally win an Zessica and Volumetric hair will form lesbian couple, while male Mikono will suffer.      Okada is best anime industry genuine drama writer bar none.  She only is shit if she lets her fujoshi tendencies play out, but thankfully she grew out of it and now makes no more shitty twillight clones.  No other script writer can as easily and genuinely expose character emotions in realistic matter, making viewers feel empathy with situations and characters.  A simple fact is, you cant name a better script writer for that purpose (lol Hanada).           I know that Zessicafags don't like to be told this but, Zessica was never supposed to be important. Okada got distracted by Zessica melodrama and focused on her, when she could have spent that time doing other shit. Okada had the full power to change Mikono if she wanted to but chose not to.  You do know Okada wasn't the only writer, right? There was other people. They could have done Mikono more likable but they didn't.  And even if Mikono was supposed to be different, why is she the same shit everywhere then? Shouldn't Kawamori take the chance to make her different in the manga or LN in order to fix the mess the other writers did? Oh yeah, she isn't. And if you forgot, she was a useless bitch even he was around in the first half, so what is your excuse for her being a terrible character even when Kawamori is writing her, then?  Conclusion? Kawamori never saw anything that had to be fixed about EVOL or Mikono. He's deluded she's perfect because she's his waifu.        You know, I'm actually glad Zessica ended up with the redhead dude instead of the piece of shit that was Amata. Amata didn't deserve her. He was such a shit character. I bet Zessica and Kagura have hot violent sex every night that leaves at least one of them unable to walk properly in the morning and I'm sure Kagura is a fucking loyal husbando  Fuck you, Amata  I'm no longer butthurt        That shit taste    Okada was the head writer for EVOL, which means that she was the one overseeing the other writers on how the story would develop. So trying to say that she has no blame is bullshit.  Mikono actually isn't the same everywhere. She's not the same the manga which takes a different route from the anime, nor do I think the novel either. Did you ever read either of those versions?         Who's this happy woman?     Those have to be the ugliest character designs I have seen in a while.      She's not the same the manga which takes a different route from the anime, nor do I think the novel either. Did you ever read either of those versions?  Actually, yes, I did. And you have too, you'd realize in the manga Mikono is basically the same useless damsel in distress, the only changes is that the drawing style makes her more expressive than in the anime and that Zessica gets even more screentime a date pseudo-date. But is the same shit. And no, while it has some different scenes and some changes (like male Zessica and Apollonius and Celiane showing up in the end) is not a "different route".   Okada was the head writer for EVOL, which means that she was the one overseeing the other writers on how the story would develop.  You're reading my posts wrong. I'm not defending Okada. I'm saying Kawamori is just as terrible and he's also to blame. You seem to be stuck in the idea that Kawamori isn't to blame for EVOL's mess, which is something not even the japanese fans defend.  And Kawamori is the head director, creator and actually did some episodes. And he has power over Okada. If she had to do shit it had to go under Kawamori's nose first, and he could stop her anytime. Why he did allow so much bullshit to happen is beyond me.          Stop calling Zessica Ugly!    Considering you said this  you do know Okada wasn't the only writer, right? There was other people. They could have done Mikono more likable but they didn't.   Okada does have blame she's the head writer. Kawamori wasn't around for half of the series, what he is at fault for is choosing Okada and other members of the staff that had never worked on the Sousei and then on top of that fucking off to AKB and his other projects, especially since he already knew that his staff members didn't like the main characters.   Kawamori is head director but he isn't the only director, and when he wasn't around Yamamoto took over, which means that it was also Yamamoto's job to keep the staff on course, but he failed to do, he also had power over Okada and yet never told her shut that shit down. There's plenty of blame to go around, just blaming Kawamori or Okada is stupid.            Kawamori wasn't around for half of the series,  Yes, and...? How does that excuse Mikono being a terrible character from start to end? I get Okada ruined shit with her melodrama but you started this shit saying it isn't Kawamori's fault she's a terrible heroine.   Kawamori is head director but he isn't the only director, and when he wasn't around Yamamoto took over, which means that it was also Yamamoto's job to keep the staff on course, but he failed to do, he also had power over Okada and yet never told her shut that shit down.  Alright, then why is the same shit everywhere else? If Kawamori wanted to show how EVOL would have turned out without Yamamoto and Okada ruining everything, why he hasn't done so? If Yamamoto and Okada truly sidetracked and did something Kawamori didn't want to, then why is the same shit in SRW, manga and LN? Mikono is always useless and a bitch, Amata is always a retarded white knight, Zessica is still pointlessly clinging to Amata, the dog thing is there, Fudo is never punished for being an asshole, and is always nothing we haven't seen before.  I mean, your argument would be valid if the show had recently ended and we have no way to tell how other adaptations turn out, but we have 3 different instances were there's little to no changes. If the other writers really failed at some given task by Kawamori, why haven't they fixed their failures every time they had a chance for a rewrite? Maybe because Kawamori doesn't really see anything wrong with EVOL in the first place?          man, those new design really are rubbish. even the mecha itself looked like some knock off product from China     male Zessica  What chapter exactly?     When Zessica is possessed by Mykage, she turns into ZEXY.   I was really hoping the mouths would look better in motion than in the stills. They don't.   I vastly prefer what happened in the anime.     yfw new zessica is going to win.     Okay talk me into watching this /a/.  Convince me that it won't be shit like the two timewasters before it.      Proof that Zessica ended up with anyone?    Shit character designs   no Akino song   it'sshit.exe       Yes, and...? How does that excuse Mikono being a terrible character from start to end? I get Okada ruined shit with her melodrama but you started this shit saying it isn't Kawamori's fault she's a terrible heroine.  I meant that it's his fault for not being around for half the series, for why the series went off the rails. However, it's unreasonable to assign sole blame to a person who simply isn't around to develop the character, Kawamori had the concept but Okada was also free to deviate from that concept if she so wished. However Okada didn't, because she never saw any problem with it. She's responsible for not just one character but all of them, to try and claim that she's only responsible for one thing wrong with the story, she's head writer she's in charge of all of these things.   Alright, then why is the same shit everywhere else?  Those novels and the manga are really just adaptations of the anime not meant to deviate from its source material but to essentially tell the same story in a different medium. You see this with plenty of serieReally no different from the Macross novels and manga. Also Kawamori has nothing to do with them outside of giving them to okay to make them, its just like how he gets credit for all the Macross shit that gets made despite the fact that all he did was say "okay" to its creation. The person who wrote the story for the manga FYI is a property of Satelight and the novel written by Yasujiro Urayama. Also we know for a fact that Kawamori didn't write the story of EVOL Okada did.  The key word you need to remember here is "adaptation" they are meant to mirror their source material not deviate from it.          you can shitpost with us. it's a lot of fun.   Also dog was the greatest thing ever, I laught for the whole day after rethinking about that. This is an high level of trash.      The only reason I started watching Aquarion was because of DAT opening. Then EVOL because the first 2 eps seemed promising.  I AM NOT FALLING FOR IT NOW HOLY SHIT      It can't be worse than Evol.   http://www.fandompost.com/2015/06/2<wbr>4/aquarion-logos-anime-episode-coun<wbr>t-revealed/  According to AnimeDigitalNetwork.fr, the new series has been slotted with a twenty-seven episode run to tell its tale.  </wbr></wbr>     I'd also recommend the Aquarion OADs.     Those novels and the manga are really just adaptations of the anime not meant to deviate from its source material but to essentially tell the same story in a different medium.   The key word you need to remember here is "adaptation" they are meant to mirror their source material not deviate from it.  First of all, Kawamori is the supervisor of both, none of the writers of the manga/LN can't do anything that he doesn't approve of, and second nothing says they have to stick to the anime structure. Many manga and LN adapted from an anime original have different content, often things that couldn't be included in the tv version, because reasons. They could have done something different with them to show how good evol could have been if Kawamori had been there, but there isn't anything substantial in them. Just like in SRW where is also the same shit.  And there's really nothing stopping them from fixing it through them, nothing that rules what a manga or LN adaptation should be like. It has already been proven that Kawamori has too much freedom to do whatever he wants with his stories, which is why Satelight didn't stop him or Okada from writing all that bullshit into Evol. Which leads to:   I meant that it's his fault for not being around for half the series, for why the series went off the rails.   Kawamori had the concept but Okada was also free to deviate from that concept if she so wished.  But has Kawamori even implied it was meant to be different or that he was dissatisfied with how the show turned out? Because I only remember him being mostly absent from interviews, and the few times he wasn't he only defended Fudo and Mikono and talked his usual bullshit symbolism. He never seemed to imply there was something wrong besides denying Okada and Yamamoto's ideas.                    What does this mean?  It means 存在の耐えられない軽さ   A pleasure of being cummed inside.    dVlU   That Haru is the only one who isn't a leg spreading slut.   It means you need to kill yourself.   It means  stop making Free threads, faggot.    Nagisa a slut, Rei and Makoto fags who can't into sex, Haru a prude, Rin a pure that doesn't wanna get involved in lewd activites.      Rin a pure     His body is slutty but his personnality is that of a virginal angel.    That doesn't make sense.   I didn't watch the series, so can you tell me if we should expect the Free! movie to be another kyoanus masterpiece like disappearance and tamako love story? Or is the source material shit?   Think harder, and you'll realize it adds up actually.      his personnality is that of a virginal angel.     Hey, now. Rei spreads majestically.     Or is the source material shit?  Here's your answer.     Is that supposed to be him in high school? He looks a lot younger    It'll probably be shit.   What does this mean?   The source material is alright, will be made better by KyoAni is they continue their tradition of making better movies than series.    Yeah but then he falls over    Dr Freud.jpg    Freud.jpg      A masterpiece.    Are you implying there's something odd about taste-testing?   Haru-chan is my waifu!   Not at all.    I want to taste-test you butt   makoto my husbando     I don't get what you mean. Could you explain more clearly?     SOUHARU IS CANON   It means that I'm surprised and disappointed there are no SouRin daddy roleplay doujins.    Just cute little boys whose smiles need to be protected.    One God and one autist.    SouHaruNagi is canon    Haru-chan is my Goddess.    Why is Haru's art so much worse?    http://strawpoll.me/4727984    Rin wants to fuck his dad who also happens to be Sousuke who's in fact a reincarnation of his late dad which explains why Rin was so drawn to Souuke to begin with so it's technically incest but not really.    I want to know too.    Fujos can't into good taste.    homolust: the animation https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9UZ<wbr>hAC7IuYE</wbr>  [ ]     I don't see what the difference is     it's technically incest  SouRin confirmed best pairing yet again.     Haru looks like shit and his right eye's fucked up, Sousuke a manly.   I want to lick Haru's tits   That's some study case for Dr Freud.     Being blind     Haru looks like a beautiful girl, shut the fuck up.    they clearly don't know how to do YMCA    No bullying    Haru a shit, Sousuke a gorgeous.   It means that you faggots will actually stop posting shit on the archives, using ghost as your general.   That's because Rin didn't join them.    b-but anon th-they are both boys    Harufag confirmed for cancerous fun-ruining proxyfag.      I can't recall ever even reading a daddy roleplay doujin, whatever the fandom.    Waifufag please, you don't own the archives.    That's okay, because Haru is a girl.    A problem with that, faggot?   What's your favorite Free! doujin?    women who are drawn to husbands like their fathers   acknowledged her future husband by doing the same thing she did with her daddy.      Every RinHaru doujin.    It doesn't look pleasing visually and Sousuke deserves better than an autist. He deserves to win his waifubowl.    Will Sousuke make a proper woman out of Haru?    Freud would be touched.    You just have a shit taste, that's okay.    3deep5me    How deep does the fist goes?    You just have all the shit taste and that's not okay.

Poor Sousuke can't catch a break.    I don't normally like Sousuke but if it's delicious brown I guess it's okay    He just wants to cuddle with his husbando.   RIN A SHIT A FUCKING UGLY SHIIIIIT    Erwong a balding blonde shit.    Now that's not nice, what would Jesus think?    To think both Sousuke and SouRin would have been about a dozen time twice as delicious had Kyoani given him a darker tan. Suffering.     Harufag in charge of not sperging     All the Sousuke are gorgeous and perfection.    Jesus wouldn't want you to have such hateful thoughts.    Jesus thinks you're a faggot.    Too bad he's shit     never    Will Rei be in the movie? How would they do that?   Jesus loves everyone and you must learn to love everyone too.    They already look perfect together, you brownfag.    There won't be a movie.    Based Proxy-chan.     ITT 500 SouHarufags      Harufag tries to circlejerk   no other Harufags around to circlejerk with him   becomes asspained and shits on Rin/SouRin instead  Every thread.       There's cuddling and then there's being plain clingy so the person will eventually give in and bend you over the nearest flat surface to give you the pounding you've been yearning for. Rin's always the latter.    I'm here, I just don't want to circlejerk.    Maybe he shouldn't have sperged on the other Harufags.    I agree, but there was potential for them to look even greater.    I just love my waifu and I pray to the Lord to forgive your shit taste.   Rin &gt;&gt;&gt; Haru   But my favorite Free is a devout Christian and the Lord loves him, didn't you read that totally legitimate article?   Haru is a beautiful arabian woman.   But he wants to cuddle after the pounding.    21 posters   151 posts   all shitposting  Sasuga Freefags       Mudslims   Beautiful      Haru is a number of things but she isn't a filthy sandnigger.    All of 5P is supposed to be in it but we have no idea how they'll do it. Probably do some "almost met before" scene.    fuck off already with your meta shit.     quads  It's over, Free is finished.     That's just for 2 minutes before even more pounding though. It's a never ending mating circle.    fuck off already with your meta shit.    freefags confirmed for shit BTFO    Free has been finished for quite a while, it's not like that's stopping us.   Holy shit these threads are worse than Madoka tripfag circlejerks. Kill yourselves back to /ghost/ already. Mods should fucking ban these threads.   Kek    fwhat did you except from ujoshitfags   It's that time again  This time?  But now for sure     You're pretty shit at this, dude.        You're worse than Rei at this.      Are you sure   Rin-chan a slut.  Is this YMCA? I honestly can't tell.  Seriously, you guys are making Narutards, JoJofags and Yaharifags look less cancerous.   Rin is pure.     Check'em   But are we making SnKfags look less cancerous?    Sweet, now check mine   Absolutely.       Haru-chan a god    Sasuga Haru-chan   Are Freefags the new Narutofags?  I don't know what's worse: that the gooks made a cartoon with 8 near-identical episodes, or that I actually watched them.   Season 3 was announced you dip.   It was meant to show how anime has become static and how everything has become the same.   It's like poetry.    It was a social commentary on the rudimentary and passive lifestyles of young Japanese adults.     And some people actually bought them.    Is this the best show Kyoani has made Haruhi aside ?   The problem with S2 is that it was a sequel to S1. Which was also shit.   Haruhi isn't even that good.   Kyoani isn't even that good, anon. Haruhi is still their magnum opus.      Chuuni &gt; Tamako &gt; Key anime  Seriously nigger    Of what I've watched.  Haruhi&gt;K-On&gt;Nichijou&gt;FMP&gt;Hibike&gt;KnK<wbr>&gt;Chu2&gt;Clannad  Yes Hibike is good, but its not the best Kyoani work.  </wbr>    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PGi<wbr>yDw3dOSs</wbr>  [ ]  Boruto  - Rasengan and Rasenshuriken - Chidori and other lightning based jutsu - Multi Shadow Clone - Snake Summoning - Snake based Jutsu like the shed skin - Toad Summoning - Sage Mode  Sarada  - Sharingan  <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127121565#p127121565">Click here</a> to view the full text.                    so the antagonists all are byakugan aliums, some who have rinnegan handeyes as well?     Usually we got put in our place though.  hat makes you think bolt won't?  the whole movie is about him being put in his place        So 13 years have passed and Sasuke still doesn't have a new arm.  He doesn't need one. When you are as powerful as he is it no longer affects his daily life. It's his non-dominant arm anyway.      Oda doesn't have a stop button.   implying oda won't literally work himself to death despite (WJS Mandated) On Break Next Week.       It's his non-dominant arm anyway.  sauce was left handed before 698.    We wait for summary anon  Link for those who missed last thread <br/>     It's time     Kotori wasn't so she can call 'the thing' that is floating while releasing a five-colored lights a human anymore.  Fuck, I want a colored illustration for this.     Nah, looks like even Kotori doesn't know where Mana's living.    He is getting his equivalent to an astral dress but there is no illustration? This is a crime.    but Reine does? That's weird.   So did she really loved him?   Well no. She was going to, so that's why she tried to kill him.    This was pretty clearly not a historically-accurate show. We saw nothing to suggest that any guns existed at that time aside from Entou Jyuu which, as the creator Shikizaki Shiki himself stated, were based off of an as-yet future technology, implying guns really didn't exist anywhere at that point in time.     I dunno who she is or who he is for that matter but I liked this show for its cleverness     Shichika letting Hitei follow him around and not carrying through any vengeance on her was him letting go of any anger that might consume him, because he acknowledged that that vengeance-driven anger is exactly what inevitably led Togame to her death. If she just let go of avenging her father and shit, she would have never stooped to dirty manipulative tactics. But instead, she charged into danger fully accepting the fact that her life was being put on the line when it truly didn't have to be put on the line at all. Letting anger consume him would first of all be making the same mistake Togame did, and would also be disrespecting her choice in life to pursue her vengeance, which ultimately led to them meeting each other. Secondly, he got most of his vengeance by killing Emonzaemon who was the one who directly killed Togame in the first place, and he even got to finish Togame's vengeance plan by killing the Shogun, supposedly letting her spirit rest with its life goal complete. Killing Hitei would have been senseless and making an obvious mistake, as well as out of line for Shichika. The ending of Katanagatari is a little complicated, but if you just stop and think about it for a while it's very straightforward and in-line with Shichika's character growth.  Not to mention Hitei's the one following him around, he doesn't seek out her company, instead he tolerates it.         She said what she did to make him like her less, so her death would easier for him to cope with. So the answer is yes. </blockquote>]
