[ Started reading this, then the imouto showed up.<br><br> "There's no problem at all, Onii-sama, because they are them, and we are us. I'm sure the sibling bonds of everyone else here are as cold as tundra. Our modern era is sick like that. But you and I are different. Such a kiss can't even express the love I've felt for four long years. Even if we have sex right here, it'd be no more than a greeting."  <br><br>If I didn't have anything else to read, I'd probably drop this.</br></br></br></br>  Picked up.  You know you got nothing to read when you're catching up with ari-shitreta  Time to read this.  Pic related is the imouto.<br><br>Apparently they're blood-related, but she has fucking white hair and green eyes while he's generic Japanese highschooler.</br></br>  <br>What's up with all the red haired chicks as main heroines in LNs?</br>  <br>I heard Arifureta is really shit, but I'll probably pick it up too at this rate.</br>  would pick up if they do have sex  <br>Tsundere disease.<br>But the main girl is probably the best thing about the LN. Everything else is pretty damn bad.</br></br>  <br>Not really. Arifureta is no where near the worst thing getting translated as sad as that is.</br>  Huh, the girls in this sure are slutty.  And be the end of the volume she's completely given up doing anything indecent with her onii-chan, is happy that they finally get to be together just as brother and sister again, and supports his relationship with his girlfriend.  <br>What's the worst in your opinion then? Zhan Long, maybe?</br>  <br>That's the last you see of imouto.</br>  <br>I tried reading this but couldn't get past chapter 1.<br>Shit was generic as fuck and didn't even try to hide it.<br>The heroine doesn't do enough for me to warrant soldiering on and this being some pseudo battle harem, I have reasons to believe nothing aside from a kissu~ or some shit will happen by the seventh volume.<br>Plus imouto doesn't even stay for what I've heard.<br>Why do people submit themselves to such unredeemable shit?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, mutual confession was at the end of the first volume.</br>  Reminder  <br>Does it actually matter, or is it back to the status quo of nothing happens?</br>  <br>Their relationship progresses each volume.</br>  <br>At the end of Vol.3  he proposes and she accepts. </br>  <br> samurai winning WWII <br> mfw <br><br>Picked up for this alone.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Interesting, interesting.<br>How about what happens in between. Does this stay a generic school battle or does it deviate, tell me this isn't another Infinite Stratos sell me on this!</br></br></br>  <br>It's no Unbreakable Dragonar Blade Dance that's for sure. It actually has progression.</br>  <br>There are school tournament battles and off school battles in parallel.</br>  <br>Are the stakes high? Are folks at risk of death during those off school battles?</br>  <br>well he  confessed to the tsundere girl and she accepted it ... it's all happened at fucking chapter 11 </br>  This imouto is basically an indecent version of Miyuki.<br><br>Onii-sama in every damn sentence.</br></br>  As always this episode was perfect. <br><br>Specials:<br>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?li<wbr>st=PLaWNUYckT3OPH6k_Ow2FB1CwijLzU3b<wbr>7p<br><br>Suu + Papi video:<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/14354<wbr>08457?watch_harmful=1 <br><br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/14374<wbr>77078</wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>cerea best harem<br>tio best mon<br>cathyl best side<br>cerea mom best mom<br><br>all hail titty monsters</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Can anyone fix this shit?  <br>this, drop the meme tho</br>  OH GOD PAPI  <br>Here, brah.</br>  Daily reminder that Rachnee is bestnee  Papi is cute. CUTE!  Are we all ignore how Smith is the best girl?  <br>I don't remember this line being in the manga. Smith, I don't think this is a good idea...what if a women host gets an interspecies girl and they are both straight? What if a male host gets an interspecies guy and they are both straight? What if a host and an interspecies both like eachother as friends, but aren't interested in marriage? Also, don't host families have no idea what kind of interspecies to expect when they agree to house one? Like, that family was surprised when they got Rachnee.</br>  <br>She is a predator, afterall. Papi knows when prey is resisting... you just have to TAKE IT!</br>  It seems that they will skip a chapter next week to have two chapters of Suu.<br><br>I wonder if they have the Miia shedding later or if they just skip it totally.</br></br>  <br>sporty horse girl is the best.</br>  <br> I wonder if they have the Miia shedding later or if they just skip it totally <br>Saving it for OVA?</br></br>  <br>she meant that they can't stop it if romance develops so they need to create provisions for it in the law to avoid civil discord.</br>  <br> Skip a chapter <br><br>I don't think so, Lerche doesn't need to do that just put an introduction of suu and keep the 2ch per episode rule.</br></br></br>  Miia in yandere mode when?  <br> Cerea is the shittiest variaton of centaur </br>  <br>Did you even watch the episode?</br>  <br>the preview was for Suu introduction, and the one where they play with the children, they are skiping the shedding</br>  <br>She wasn't implying that host families had to marry their extra species charges.</br>  Daily birdness.  Centorea confirmed for Jojo crossover  <br>This is how she expressed it in the manga.<br><br>The interspecies relations are already a thing, but they are not official part of the bill.<br>The host thing is temporary system to slowly integrate non-humans to human society and assumedly such system would later be removed for normal freedom for non-humans.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Avian &gt; Harpy.</br>  <br>She said interspecies relationships, not just as part of their little exchange program you trog.

The sex that is.</br>  <br>Wow that's really interesting, where are your sources regarding evolutionary biological studies on centaur tits in a fantasy harem manga world?</br>  <br>Lightweight is basically horse Wanko?</br>  <br>An actual answer, Papi calling the MC Husband.</br>  <br>What about mutual masturbation?</br>  <br>Are these subspecies canon or just an anime-only thing? They're interesting (same for the harpy and lamia ones) but I've never seen them in the manga.</br>   Shedding chapter skipped <br><br>Anime ruined</br></br>  <br><br>would you drink diary breed's milk, anon?</br></br>  <br><br>Dont you mean boss? Where you guys getting the husband from<br><br><br>Im cool with that</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well the top half is human and the bottom is horse. So I'm gonna go ahead and reference human biology for anything regarding her top half.</br>  <br>Are you really this /v/irgin faggot?</br>  <br>How do you know it was from mlp?</br>  <br>I would have her bathe me in it. Though I'd sooner prefer the cow girl because I don't like horses.</br>  <br>They're canon.</br>  <br>Considering Crabman drew them and wrote them all, its definitely going to be canon.<br><br><br>We only know they're focusing on Suu's introduction next issue. Remember, the first half could still be the shedding and establishing Miia's failure at cooling.<br><br>Remember, Suu is introduced appearing out of one of Miia's cooking pots after consuming her failure.<br><br>But they might move the shedding to later so the trash bag of Miia's shed scales isn't out of place when Mr. Asshole Exploiter shows up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The top half is centaur and the bottom half is centaur.</br>  <br>straight out of the tit</br>  <br> Considering Crabman drew them and wrote them all <br>Is that so? That's pretty fucking neat.</br></br>  <br>I hope so, I don't remember this either</br>  <br>this this this<br>holy shit I've found my waifu</br></br>  I haven't read the manga since it was first hot shit here on /a/, but spoider lady is showing up soon, right? Wash slime girl down the drain.  <br> Not from the clean, pasteurized bottle. </br>  How is it even possible for a Japanese man to have sex with a centaur? isn't she's too tall for them?  <br><br>Mmmm... A good morning. Watched Overlord. Watched this. Fapped to centaur mating and doujin on exhentai and centaur girl in mgq scene and had a wonderful orgasm, and now eating chocolate.<br><br>Yep. Tuesdays are going to be fucking awesome from now on.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rachnera is showing up on episode 8.</br>  <br>I'm still confused on how centaur sex can even seem erotic. Just thinking about it, it seems really silly looking. You can only fuck them in one position really.</br>  <br>they would probably have stools specifically marketed for this. I would brush up on my carpentry skills just to make and market them.</br>  <br><br> All these secondaries <br><br>Those subspecies comes from the manga you massive retards, the thing is you faggots never going to know when we got that since those were posted here long time ago.</br></br></br></br>  <br> no pegasus or unicorn girl by Crabman <br>DISAPPOINTMENT.  I hope it's the first and the last one. </br></br>  <br>A stool? or she could sit down. Try fucking a taller girl and you will find out.</br>  <br><br>Why would she wear her hair like that. She blocks 2 of her eyes. That makes no sense.</br></br>  I want Papi to lay my eggs.   Friendly reminder that this whole full moon faisco is all Smith's fault, and if she hadn't been so lazy and forgetful, Darling wouldn't have to deal with three horny girls trying to kill him.   <br>how's the taste? is it better than cow's milk? is it sweeter than sheep's?</br>  <br>That's pretty crushing news. Oh well, I'll still keep watching.</br>  <br> Hurr durr I are leet manga reader. <br>Why don't you go find a Yahrai thread to shitpost in.</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KGe<wbr>9F7kPmG0</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Waiting for someone to do it properly, I'm too lazy  <br>Human beings wear their hair in ways that they block one of their only two eyes. I don't think it's such a big deal for her.</br>   no Papi lewd <br> make her clothes baggy <br>Perfect episode my ass.<br>They really only care for big breasts with this adaptation.</br></br></br>  <br>FUCK<br>OFF<br>SECONDARY<br><br>You don't belong here retard stop trying to fit.</br></br></br></br></br>   <br>I dunno, chapter 25 seems like a better fit for OVA than shedding chapter.</br>  <br><br>Get out</br></br>  <br>Not that anon, but if the show started airing and sales bumped up out of nowhere... (ex: they weren't advertising more or anything)<br>It's probably the show</br></br>  <br> Stepstool <br> Ladder <br> Her lying on the bed and you standing. <br> You lying down she ontop of you <br> She on her back, you ontop of her. <br><br><br>Its the action of the pussy, anon. Centaur mares have loose pussies, yes. But there are very powerful muscles around them. The effect is like going from an incredibly hot, wet fleshy passage, to suddenly virgin tightness squezing pulsing around you. Also their pussies are warm, like steaming on cold days warm. All of their real erogenous zones are right at the opening, so a human dick would pleasure them to orgasm just fine. Stallion dick isn't about pleasuring the female, its about ramming the seed into her womb and making sure it stays there. Which is why they usually only take 10 seconds to cum.<br><br>So a human, standing behind a centaur, would have the underside of his cock rubbed by her clitoris as the muscular action contracts her pussy around his cock in an intense milking sensation. Coupled with her pinning you to the wall and her hips shaking and pumping you in and out, with her cries in the air and her calling out her love for you and how good it feels...<br><br>Yeah, it would be pretty erotic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck yeah old jackie chan movies are awesome<br><br>to more relevant things though<br><br>spider a best but I approve of all your choices</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i'm pretty sure it's mentioned somewhere in the manga that she also has bad eyesight, so it's not as much of a problem</br>  Are you sure? I've read the entire manga, and I've never seen any of these subspecies. I thought they were just a new interesting lore drop at the end of each new anime episode.  <br>Dude. I was following it from issue 1. Stop crying. I'm just spoonfeeding the secondaries because its my hobby.</br>  <br>Sounds ike someone is speaking from experience here.</br>  <br>meant for<br><br>sorry.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Source: my ass.</br></br>  <br>Sorry, guess I'm a freak. I don't find fucking a horse to be all that erotic.</br>  <br> having to use some aid just to match heights with your sexual partner <br>They should commit sudoku before such dishonor.<br><br><br>been there done that, wouldn't work if she had hooves.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Those subspecies comes from the manga you massive retards <br>I've read the manga up to chapter 31 and never saw them.</br></br>  <br>So at least another week</br>  God damn, the anime is turning me into a Cerea fag. How did she get so cute  <br>It was during a full moon, they were all out of control.<br> Still, it was a funny observation. </br></br>  <br><br> Being this retarded secondaries <br><br>2 words: READING COMPREHENSION </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Dont worry, it means you have a refined taste.</br></br>  <br><br>Fucking gallons of mare cum too, Jesus fuck. It's like snot it's so thick and viscous. and NEVER stand behind a mare when she's in heat because she will pin you against the wall and rub her pussy on you, and might break some bones in the process.</br></br>  <br>Mares are flirty little bitches. Who love to pin you. But no, speaking from learning <br><br><br>2 issues an episode. Rachnera is introduced on issue 14 in a little shadowy corner after she ties up and calls the cops on asshole exploiter. Then on 15 she kidnaps Darling and joins the Harem. On 16 she tries to rape Darling repeatedly but gets pussyblocked by Cerea then they make up and make friends.<br><br>So according to the schedule of INTELLIGENT THOUGHT... Rachnera will be seen in the shadows at the end of episode 7, then her whole episode devoted to her on 8.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How did people react to the first episode? I missed it.  <br>We've seen the harpie subspecies before.</br>  <br>In other words those things are special content coming from the Manga not included in the actual translations.<br><br>Now fuck off animeonlyfags.</br></br></br>  Was it rape?  <br>Secondaryfag confirmed for not reading the manga, being an seasonal casual and the very thing he shitposts about.</br>  the cutest  Why do people refer to the mangaka by Crabman?  <br> "HURR DURR SECONDARIES I MAEK POST" <br>Actually, I think you need to understand what "reading comprehension" is.</br></br>  <br>Anon both loved it and hated it. But we're still following it with out dicks in our hands because while we're not getting nipples and more lewd shots, we are getting what is really sexy.<br><br>Miia's coiling.<br><br>Cerea's blushing and droopy ears and big hind end.<br><br>Papi's everything.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>cause he has crabs</br>  <br><br>While these guys fight over stupid shit, us harpy lovers are just chillin.</br></br>  <br>is there a webm of embarrassed hand holding cerea yet?</br>  <br> NEVER stand behind a mare when she's in heat because she will pin you against the wall and rub her pussy on you, and might break some bones in the process. <br><br><br>This. Watch the fuck out, people.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anime Papi is quickly winning my heart for some reason.</br>  would you be upset if the last episode is an anime original?  <br>The way he shows himself in little omake's is a little hermit crab, one claw being a pen that he draws and signs with. Its adorable.<br><br><br>She is goddamn adorable, Anon. Her face has got to be the cutest anime girl face ever.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sickened but curious</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br/>  <br>Yes it was.

The main characters appearance is a definite change of pace. Like a skeletor anime. But it'll have to bring something to the table soon. Starting to really slog at the end of the second episode there.  <br>There have been employees from Funi here before. They treat anime with disdain and the working environment is horrible</br>  So is this going to be an overlord thread or just waiting for the pruning?  <br>Gotta love Funi's fuck-ups.</br>  <br>Poop, possibly a few cool fights as the floor masters face off against whatever human enemies they end up facing later, I'm assuming, and assuming momonga doesn't just walk all over them.</br>  <br>Holy fuck, time to download the RAWs then.</br>  <br>literally every single screenshot I've seen of this show on 4chan has a sexual innuendo.</br>  <br>That's from Mikagura. <br>The Shirayuki hime fuck up was release episode 3 with episode 4's audio</br></br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  <br>Sexual innuendos=/=fanservice<br>Also, there aren't that many innuendos.<br>What you see from some cherry picked screenshots proves nothing</br></br></br>  <br>And HorribleSubs encoded it without making sure everything was fine?</br>  <br> And HorribleSubs encoded it <br> smug anime face.jpg </br></br>  <br> HorribleSubs encoded it </br>  <br><br>I meant stole. I'm not that dumb.</br></br>  <br> HorribleSubs rips it manually </br>  <br>How would I know they're using a bot.. I mean yeah, it makes sense. Pls no bully.</br>  <br>Holy fuck, at least lurk before posting.<br>Fucking newfag, I swear.</br></br>  <br> How would I know they're using a bot <br>Because they have literally said multiple times that they use a bot to rip stream sites, newfag-kun.</br></br>  <br>I dunno Papa Bones is sexy as fuck.</br>  AINZ - SAMAAAA!!!<br>KISSU!<br>KISSU!!</br></br>  <br>Moe~</br>  So what are you fellas doing while waiting for your weekly dose? Currently going through 37 year old, ex-businessman slime tensei.  Is there any other manga or anime where the MC is an ruler or an overlord?  Tomorrow's the day  <br>I'd give Shalltear my Spuit Lance if you get what I mean.</br>  <br>Next episode the slaughter begins, and it keeps going up from there and end on a pretty high note.<br><br>If by some crazy stroke of luck we get a second season it will escalate even further.</br></br></br>  <br>Lizard sex animated on TV! Crusch x Zaryusu OTP!</br>  <br>I wonder if its any different from anahole when i put my dick in there</br>  <br>Pretty sure it's only adapting up to volume 3.</br>  <br>Oh never mind, didn't notice the second season part in the post you was replying to.</br>  <br>I really do want to see the lizard sex animated though.<br><br>For research purposes of course.</br></br></br>  <br>  We will never get to Volume 9 and see Ainz in his World Domination mode glory.  <br> ;_; </br></br>  <br>sure we will. Five years from now.</br>   nothing to talk about till tomorrow   <br>Don't worry, if we keep studying Japanese I'm sure we can sort of read it in a few years.</br>  <br><br/></br>  If the anime means that we get more so-bin art, I'm all for it.  <br>Oh thats a new one. I like it.</br>  <br>How can anyone fuck up this much?</br>  Excuse me,<br><br>Best girl is passing by</br></br>  <br><br>I can't properly describe what my dick is feeling at this pic.</br></br>  <br><br>We can only hope some retard got fired, right? I also hope I'll live to see the day funi goes under.</br></br>  <br>Eh, Overlord air on Hulu later in the day. So whatever I catch first.</br>  <br>It's finally time.</br>  Over Lord? More like Over Bored.  <br>no quite. We won't get that far tomorrow.</br>  <br>No patience animeonlyfag gtfo</br>  <br>*not <br><br><br>*airs <br><br>FUCK</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hulu is better than Funi? How is this even possible? Funi is the direct source.</br>  <br>At least death knight will have some fun.</br>  <br>I'unno. If it is or not I never noticed it. <br><br><br>Yup.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We should get him summoning the DK and blowing up people's hearts though.</br>  <br>Ainz always blowing up peoples heart.</br>  Threadly Reminder  <br> retard lovers <br>not even once</br></br>  <br>Who is last born and toilet? <br><br>Also what race is Yuri? Is she a dragon like Sebas since she's the only one who doesn't hate humans?</br></br></br>  <br>You could check the wiki.</br>  <br>Nobody really knows who they are yet. <br><br>Yuri is a Dulahan.</br></br></br>  <br>Lastborn is the immortal human lieutenant of the meidos who ranks above Yuri but below Sebastian. She hasn't been shown in the LNs yet.<br><br>Toilé(t) is  the whore Sebastian saves from Eight Fingers and the sister of Ninya <br><br>Yuri is a Dullahan.<br><br><br> retard meme <br>Pic related</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> narberal being retarded is a meme <br>Narberalfags are as braindamaged as their waifu.</br></br>  <br>No bully pls</br>  <br>Reminder that Entoma literally means "bugs".</br>  <br>Narberal is cute precisely because she's so bullyable.<br><br>Her best moments are when she screws up and Ainz has to correct it.</br></br></br>  <br>Pls</br>  <br>I figured that's who toilet was, but just wanted to be sure.<br><br><br>What would one level in Dullahan even give you?<br><br>Also I though she was the head of the maids excluding Lastborn, but why is she like 12 levels lower than Narberal? That just seems weird to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't say<br><br><br>She's the one most fit to lead them when Sebas isn't around.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's the head of the Pleiades.</br>  <br> What would one level in Dullahan even give you? <br><br>Not being harmed by decapitation.</br></br></br>  <br>Solution is second best though</br>  <br>The main character aka protagonist is a fucking SKELETON! A spooky skeleton with a fucking armor! Isn't that enough for you tough boy? Eh?</br>  <br> Isn't that enough for you tough boy? Eh? </br>  <br>damn, I haven't seen this pic in a long ass tme lol</br>    <br> Fake tits </br>  <br>Mononga sama is great.</br>  <br>When does it even air? Threads have up since Saturday.</br>  <br>Tuesdays, with LN chapter translations on Saturdays.</br>  Prepare yourself for terrible CG.  <br>Best girl is not even a girl</br>  <br><br>Yeah, it's doppelgänger.</br></br>  <br>Can't be worse than anything we've seen so far. Looked a bit awkward but okay in the preview.</br>  <br> implying </br>  Longest 7 days ever.  I don't understand why there's an argument over who the best made is. Yuri was made by Papa Bones, who's simply the best. His direct children should always rank above his adopted ones.  <br> Yuri was made by Papa Bones <br>We don't actually know that yet. It's not been said in the Tld chapters so far.</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure that's a broken translation, Naberal is a shapeshifter while PA is a doppelganger. PA looks like how doppels normally look like, naberals "natural" form is half man half woman mostly monsterous looking.</br>  <br> Implying there are people who don't rate PA the best guardian. <br><br>Like a lot of families with adopted kids, Ainz tends to treat his surrogate kids way better than his direct kid.</br></br></br>  <br>They're both doppelgangers, not a broken translation m8.<br>Plus in the web novel Narberal actually shows her true form which is exactly like Pandora's actor, a face with holes for the eyes and the mouth.</br></br>  drop after 15th minute ep.1... is worth or what?  <br>No.</br>  <br>What the actual fuck is going on here?</br>  <br>Mare gettin shit done</br>  <br>Just because he treats PA like crap, doesn't mean PA still isn't the best. Same goes for Yuri. I thought her being his creation was one of the earliest spoilers we got in these threads.</br>   My order of volume 3 and 4 will arrive today <br><br>Yiss</br></br>  <br>Again, that's never been proven.</br>  <br>While it's heavily implied that all guild members had a hand in making the maids, we still don't know who made what.</br>  Just why is PA rated so highly anyway? Is it because unlike the other guardians, he verifies Momonga's orders before he does them?  <br>Is that the translated one? I thought someone said it was translated in their country to something but I can't remember what.</br>  <br>More like it's because he's a goofball nazi.</br>  <br>PA's ability to mimic up to 45 other builds at 80% power gives makes him a very tough opponent apparently.</br>  <br> Yes </br>  <br>Mare was practicing after receiving Demiurge's private lesson.<br><br> “In addition, regarding the plan to strengthen Nazarick, I am also very interested. I want to know how far our kids can go. How about it Mare, you want to have children?” <br><br> “Uh? Huh?” <br><br> “However, that is impossible without a partner… If you find any humans, dark elves or wood elves, could you please capture them?” <br><br> “Eh? Ehhh?” Mare briefly nodded: “I-, if this helps Momonga-sama…. Then I will do it. But how are children born?” <br><br> “Well, when it comes to that time I will teach you. If you decide to experiment on your own, Momonga-sama will probably scold you. Due to maintaining the Great Tomb of Nazarick’s operating cost, it should be better if we try to maintain the balance first.” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Apparently <br><br>You really think that level of versatility doesn't make him high tier?</br></br></br>  <br> Elf rapist <br> No elf being raped <br>Why</br></br></br>  <br>There were guys in the guild that were broken, like Touch me. 80% of fucking invincible is still a lot.</br>  how long has momonga been in charge anyways? that blob guy from the first episode said he last saw him like 2-ish years ago right? and it sounded like he was surprised momonga was in charge now and that's why the guild is still around.  <br>This dialogue will be animated?</br>  <br>It's not like he can take on more than one form at a time and wouldn't there be a lag between forms. Also that 20% from top form is pretty significant. I don't know if just having a counter build is enough to bridge that.</br>  <br>It was skipped.</br>  <br>No, it got skipped. It was during episode 2.</br>  <br>For a very long time. He wasn't surprised that Momonga was in charge NOW, but that he was STILL around and covering the Guild's maintenance fees because almost everyone else had already quit.</br>  What's the current pace of the anime (1 LN = X episodes)?<br><br>Are the LNs worth reading?</br></br>  <br>Pretty much 4 episodes per volume. And yes.</br>  <br>It's only an issue if he was facing someone who had the stats that could match one of those forms at 100%. 80% of a God's stats could still wreck 100% of an ant's stats.</br>  <br> &gt;&gt;No elf being raped <br> implying <br>Demiurge want Mare to capture elves too (). I wouldn't be surprised if that guy has already prepared a rape dungeon filled with Orc.</br></br></br>  <br>Patience is great, but just like SAO and Log Horizon it's clear that this show will wear out its welcome after a season, and there's no chance it'll get more than two seasons. So, there's a limited time in which events can happen.</br>  <br>What  said but be advised that the translation quality of like half of the first volume is pretty poor. It gets better though.</br>  DON'T YOU GIVE ME YOUR LOVE AND PASSION  <br>I thought you meant against other equals, then the advantages are situational. <br>Just about anyone in that world is pretty puny.</br></br>  <br> But how are children born? </br>  <br> <br>The woman is a noble who lead a criminal group<br>Said group pissed MC off by kidnapping Sebas' waifu<br>He sent Mare and Entoma out<br>They go to her house.<br>Entoma eats the guards.<br>Noble chick tries to launch a sneak attack on him, sending out magic snakes.<br>Mare grabs those snakes and crushes them in his hands.<br>He then proceeds to twist her foot, causing the bones to protrude from the muscle.<br>Then he grabs her hair and drags her along, telling her to move faster.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> <br><br>Good alignment my ass, that kid's fucking creepy I swear, just look at his face.</br></br></br>  <br>Even against most other level 100s Pandora's Actor would still have an overwhelming advantage from having copied Touch Me (World Champion) and Ulbert (World Magic Champion).</br>  <br>Mare is actually kidnapping a girl to fuck her then? Interesting frown there.</br>  <br>It's neutral good, not good.</br>  It's ok to be Mare sexual right?  <br>Otoko.</br>  <br>Good does not mean nice</br>  <br><br>I'm sure his versatility and ability to transform into two world champions is extremely powerful, but he lacks in the knowledge and items for proper use for those builds. Also, Albedo only considers him to be on the same level as herself and Demiurge. Of course it's possible she just never considered him turning into world champions, but her assessment is probably accurate.</br></br>  <br>He's Neutral Evil. Neutral Good is Shizu and good is Yuri or Sebas.</br>  <br>Mare's actually evil though.</br>  <br>Why would punishing some uppity animals affect his alignment?</br>  <br>Why Mare and Entoma? Knowing Ainz, he must have thought really hard about it before he chose them.</br>  <br>Well it's not like he can send most of his guardians<br><br>Cocytus is a giant lizard monster<br>Albedo would probably murder everyone in a fit of yandere rage<br>Shalltear obviously cant be trusted to take hostages<br>Victim is pretty easy to kill<br>Gargantua is a xbox hueg golem<br>Demiurge and Sebastian were busy with their own stuff</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Cocytus <br> lizard monster </br></br>  <br>Why not send meidos?</br>  <br>*bug-lizard monster</br>  <br>He's an Ant Mantis.</br>   Sharknado is a real spell and we will see it animated <br><br>Thank you based Momonga</br></br>  <br> Meidos were sent to help Demiurge. </br>  <br>Characters act according to their alignment. Their behavior doesn't change it.</br>  <br>Looks more like some amalgamation of large beetles, like stag/hercules beetles.<br><br>Immediately thought of this guy when I first saw him</br></br></br>  <br>Is this what pokemon has become</br>  <br>I fucking wish</br>  <br>So he's a mANTis?</br>  <br> Yes. </br>  <br>Entoma IS a meido...</br>  <br>How much was it? Shipping cost? <br><br> So Bin artbook when? </br></br></br>  <br> What would one level in Dullahan even give you? <br><br>The ability to give good head.</br></br></br>  <br>Clackity clack clack.</br>    <br>If I recall, he sent almost everyone that could be disguised as a human.  The whole event only got out of hand once Blue Rose intercepted Entoma. Both were after the Eight Fingers, but the goody two-shoes Blue Rose adventurers wouldn't let Entoma go once they met her, because she was eating people in front of them, even if those people were guards of Eight Fingers. Entoma even asked if they would ignore her, but the muscle thing/woman wouldn't let her go. </br>  I've been reading the LN, and mostly it's "We don't know fuck all, so we need to investigate." When they finally do, they discover the MC and his minions are hilariously overpowered compared to everybody else.<br><br>It gets interesting when  one of his own minions gets mind controlled , though, because he actually has to form a plan. Judging from the OP of the show, that battle will probably be the finale.</br></br>  <br>I'm still pissed that their leader  managed to resurrect the two that Demiurge killed. What good id resurrection magic if everyone and their grandmother can use it? </br>  <br>Feel  kinda bad  Gagaran  is probably going to be brutally wasted.  <br>I hate her character design, but I admit it fits with her personally rather than the "beautiful butch musclegirl with the 10/10 face" and she's bro-tier as hell going by the last chapter.<br><br> But god I hate Climb. Even though I want to like him. But I hate him. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Have we ever seen Ainz hold any writing instruments? My mind is boggling on how the hell he holds a pencil or brush with those slenderman skeleton fingers.</br>  <br>Who doesn't hate Climb? Fucking Climb, man.</br>  <br>with those points all Ainz needs is an Inkwell</br>  <br>Well, I don't really care for him but I don't particularly hate him either. I'm just waiting for the day he discovers what his precious princess thinks of him and humans in general.He'll wish he were dead.</br>  <br> lolis never EVER get any kind of sex in any anime, ever <br> any time a shota is introduced, he ALWAYS fucks someone <br>Fucking double standards holy shit, so frustrating.</br></br></br>  <br>I only see a chair</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>It's only everyone we meet because they have the resources to do so.<br>It's costly as hell to resurrect people, since the New World plays by D&amp;D rules. And that sort of magic is costly as hell for anybody not a wandering murderhobo-cum-adventurer-thief. Like, literal lifetimes of commoner money, if not the effort to find people who can actually do it.<br><br>As well,  it only works on "strong" people anyways, since you seem to lose levels on respawn with that sort of magic. Anyone too low in "level" can't be brought back, as Khajit implied about his mother. </br></br></br></br>  <br>You see anon<br><br> something something boys always want sex says men who have messed up views of sex </br></br></br>  <br>Fuck, that's hilarious. And a good point. I've always wanted to just be able to finger write without having to literally write it out with a stick that made it not look smudgy and shitty.</br>  <br> Plus the person has to want to come back, though I wonder who'd not want to come back if they could. How many levels did the Blue Rose people lose? </br>   Ainz says dark elf twins are too young to know about sex <br> when they're 70+ years old <br><br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>I WANT to like him. He just tries so hard, the poor bastard. He is the stuff that real heroes are made of, what with his obviously pure as grace heart.<br><br>But he just eats up so much story with his goddamn sob story and STOIC LOYALTY. At least Gazef was fighting an uphill battle physically and politically with a modicum of personality.<br><br> though I am preaching to the (dark) choir of Nazarick, I assume </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To him, they're less than ten years old, since they were "born" when Bukubuku Chagama(?) created them.<br><br>As well, that's how they were created. 70-year old virgins. Because of roughly-made NPC blurbs that did nothing for Yggdrasil's gameplay other than making PCs feel awesome about their OCs in their virtual circlejerk palaces (read: guilds).</br></br></br>  <br>Ganbatte, toilet-san</br>  <br>If Khajit somehow got his wish, I would assume the irony would be that his mother would reject him trying to call her back to the earthly world. <br><br> I mean, he'd kill thousands, if not millions, to get enough negative/death energy to become a lich, THEN kill more to research his perfect resurrection spell for her. What mother wouldn't be appalled she was even tangentially related to that sort of slaughter? </br></br></br>  <br>We don't know. All we know is from dubious rumors by Chinafags and people who read moon off of the (admittedly quite different, especially for later volumes) web novel.<br>All we know is who gets rekd, details are lost (if they're even true at all). And once they get published in the re-written LNs as opposed to the WN volumes, who knows where the story will head?</br></br>  Can Ainz-sama bring back Ed's mom?  <br>Bait response aside, he could. She'd come back as a shambling mess of organs, bones, and necrotic goo screaming in mindless agony and rage, but yeah, he could. <br>I mean, it's not much different from what Ed/Al did.</br></br>  <br>Ed/Al might have had a bit bigger success if, you know, those weren't revealed to be a different woman's bones.</br>  <br> making PCs feel awesome about their OCs in their virtual circlejerk palaces (read: guilds). <br>You just have to know that probably a lot of guilds were Magical Realm as all get-out. If future /a/ played Yggdrasil and remade Touch the Fluffy Tail or whatever TERA guild there was, it would be a den of sluts and terrible and disgusting fetish blurbs on every R-15 (due to game age restrictions, not that a dedicated modder wouldn't get around that) sex puppet there.</br></br>  <br>Eh, disgusting flesh horror made from a summoning built off of true familial love gone wrong, gory lost limbs off some innocent-but-well-meaning kids, same difference to Ainz. <br>He'd just take a look at it, take notes, then let Demiurge play the remnants.</br></br>  <br><br>I used to lurk the tera generals, and I can confirm those fags were such sluts it was unbearable. But then again any /a/ guild would probably be the same if some game like Yggdrasil ever pops up.</br></br>  <br> or whatever TERA guild there was, it would be a den of sluts <br>Should have joined Pettan.</br></br>  <br>Shouldn't Ainz be able to effortlessly bring hdr back too life? Death is a minor hurdle at his level.</br>  <br><br>Well considering it requires the sacrifice of lvl experience, she'd probably be too low to be resurrected.</br></br>  <br>it's not his level that matters as the person that's brought back is the one that looses levels.</br>  <br>By name alone, I can tell that guild was probably sluts pretending they weren't sluts.</br>  <br>He probably could, even without level-loss. He has an assload of rare items, many of them not even Pay items that could probably do perfect resurrections without level loss. Magic too, even.<br>But why would he spend the effort (or more importantly, items) to do so?</br></br>  <br>They spent all their time hanging out in the arena. Nothing happened in their entire lives except getting killed by at least one raid group.</br>  <br>He might be interested In having alchemists who he can learn about a new form of magic from. I can't see Ed/Al being of use for anything else except Demiurge experiments. Of course he could just grant himself the ability to use it with his wish item.</br>  What time tomorrow's the livestreaming? I always get confused. 10:30 or 11?  <br>Ainz has enough resources and competent minions to do pretty much anything he sets his mind too, in the New World. <br><br>The issue is that he generally lacks motivation and is too cautious to ambitiously experiment. His primary concern is to protect Nazarick and his children. Most of the activities he undergoes are incited by the Guardians. He would rather just stay in the background, looking for his former guild mates and having adventures.</br></br></br>  I hope to God that the next part of the LN isn't more Climb.  Finally finished reading Vol4.<br>Fuck that was long.<br><br>Vol5 chpt3 translations when?</br></br></br>  <br>Saturday.</br>  <br>but chpt2 came out 2 Sats ago ;_;</br>  <br>The LN translation seems to be on weekly basis.<br><br>Crazy, right?</br></br></br>  <br>The fuck you talking about? Chp 2 came out 2 days ago.</br>  <br>What kind of time loop are you in?</br>  <br><br>well fuck me then, time for bed.</br></br>  Man looking at the illustrations for volume 7, I feel really, really sorry for the Workers. Poor saps took the worst job possible.  <br>Is that you undead flash? Please tell me about episode 4.</br>    <br>Surprise.  More Climb. You get to see Sebas teach him how to be a man (or die in the process.) </br>  <br>Oh god please no.<br><br>Somebody save me from this fresh hell.</br></br></br>  wait a minute. If she is dead, how can she still produce body fluids.<br><br>who programmed this shit.</br></br>  manga update when?<br>i need that hugging scene illustrated</br>  <br>Her creator designed her that way. It's why they all worship the 41 Supreme Beings.</br>  3/5    <br>What?</br>  <br>She does show off her natural fingers at some point in the published novels, I'll be fucked if I can remember where though.</br>  <br>He has access to all of their gear, papa Bones stuck all of his friends armor onto statues or threw them into storage.</br>  <br>It triggers my autism knowing there will always be a gap in his collection from the last 3 that left without deleting the characters and giving him their gear.</br>  So how much do the NPCs remember about the Players or Supreme Beings? Its clear they know they were created by them but do they remember the game as it was their reality or just the background they were given?  <br>right after fighting khajit/clementine saving alchy shota in the tomb. The Virtuous King of The Forest asks about it. I'm wondering if they are going to bring up the sentient item they gave to the King. Probably not for another 10 volumes.<br><br>Probably because they are in the game world somewhere. Papa has 11 world class items anyways so its not like he needs more crazy shit to fuck around with.<br><br>They understand their settings but the characters seem to take after their creators in the gaps. They act as if they were always sentient.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They act as if they were always sentient. <br><br>That just makes me imagine all the terrible shit that could've happened if a pervert played this game<br><br>Imagine some pervert making his NPC follower into a scantily clad waifu and then forcing her to take on humiliating poses using the menu or giving her a cringeworthy backstory a la "She loves me and is a nympho who needs cock at least three times a day bla bla bla"<br><br>Then you accidentally go to the new world and your NPC waifu who was accustomed to doing the "bend over" pose and "sexy dancing" emote is real and remembers every single thing you've done together, even the times you ran into her character model repeatedly and pretended it was sex.<br><br>Man, I'm glad for Ainz but I would have fucked this opportunity up so badly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but I would have fucked this opportunity up so badly <br>Oh anon.</br></br>  So did anybody else hear him at the end of episode 2? It was the last thing I was expecting.  <br>If you think that's bad, just imagine what /tg/ and /d/ would get up to as part of an evil guild.</br>  reading time  <br>Woot! Reading! Literature!</br>  <br>Chinese or Korean?</br>  <br> actual literal cherry picking <br><br>Sasuga disinformators.</br></br></br>  <br>Albedo, stop being so perfect please. I am trying to work, not to produce instant, infinite boners.</br>  <br> Dullahan <br> head maid <br> head <br><br>bonelaugh.gif</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget he gets to copy secret weapon Rubedo and he can do lame shit like go Ainz -&gt; Eclipse CD -&gt; transform into someone else and not be fucked over by Ainz's shitty build. Unless 80% of kill everything period means only kill it by 80% and leave 20% alive, which is still pretty damn good for just one attack.</br>  <br>Isn't he just 80% of the original's level when transformed? That would make him too low to use eclipse when mimicking Ainz</br>  <br>The one that turned into clothes?</br>  <br>It's 80% stats, not 80% of the level.</br>  <br>Is this Vol 7 or Vol 5? I'm gonna guess the 11k words is total and not per page.</br>  <br>You know what's funny. Khajit and Zuranon have to sacrifice thousands of lives to achieve lichdom. Ainz just needs a book, that he probably hoards by the hundreds.</br>  <br>But that's just how it is. Players are different than New World denizens. Compare 13 heroes leader who was a player to Climb. It's not even remotely fair.</br>  <br>I can't wait for Ainz to show Zuranon just who is the true master of the undead.</br>  <br><br>What is this!?<br><br>He's just bones....</br></br></br></br>  <br>believe it or not but skeletons are usually just bones</br>  <br>So is the human body. Oh wait.</br>  <br>A book?<br><br>I thought all he needed was the character creation screen.</br></br></br>  Next episode in 7 hours. And then it will be another 7 days until we can see Papa Bones animated again.  <br>I still wonder where we're going to stop at this episode.</br>  Hey does anyone have the image of the world map? I swear there was one, but I don't remember which volume or chapter it was, or if it was only in the manga.  <br>I say virtuous king.<br>If it happens I'm buying a hamster.</br></br>  <br>Right before the confrontation or a quarter into it.</br>  <br><br>Introduction of Strogonoff, before the battle with the Angels start.</br></br>  <br>that's a stupid move though. the Eclipse CD augments Insta-death spells which are the main reason that Ainz RP build sucks(in the game there was lots of anti-instant death resistances and Rez at high levels), so PA is better of copying Touch me or that PVP wizard</br>   In that room, a white lizardman was being pressed down with its tail lifted up. A black lizardman was riding on top.<br><br><br>Baffling.<br><br><br>Ainz didn’t understand what was going on in the very beginning. The next instant, that changed to confusion as to why they are doing that thing at a time like this.<br><br><br>Ainz then moved the sensory organ outside silently.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> <br><br>T-Too lewd</br></br>  <br>angel battle won't last part A anon haven't you watched enough animus?</br>  <br>I just started the lizardmen chapter. I had no idea you could make lizardmen so boring.<br>At least Shalltear drowning herself in drink that shouldn't even effect her was hilarious.<br>I hope they put Eck in the anime. A penguin plotting to usurp Ainz is hilarious.</br></br></br>  Where I can read the LN? <br>I just found about this anime and it was great</br>  <br>It was from Volume 9, but we only have a shitty camera picture since there are no scans yet.</br>  <br>really?</br>  <br>It's a race change item, it's mentioned in Volume 4.<br> One of the conditions was a specific item. For example, you would need the ‘Book of the Dead’ to be a lich. To turn into an imp required ‘Fallen Seeds’. And the ‘Heaven’s Feather’ that Ainz mentioned was a required item to become an angel. </br></br>    <br> shadbase </br>  <br>Ah but that's the kicker, the Eclipse CD is the only worthwhile move in Ainz's build, and it's honestly not that shit just easily countered.<br><br>Besides, it's not like there's any known counter to rez items as far as we know. Ainz himself has a ring that gives him 3 self rezes in a row without losing exp. Being able to instantly take down 1 of them then transforming into Touch Me/Ulbert/Rubedo is very useful.</br></br></br>  <br>But Ainz started the game as a skeleton, he doesn't need any items to change.</br>  <br>I laughed.</br>  <br>He was just a weak skelly in a tattered robe, he could've taken up a curved sword and maybe be one of those spooky pirates. He probably needed the book to be magical spook lord.</br>    <br>http://skythewood.blogspot.sg/2015/<wbr>05/O42.html<br>start from vol 2 at the very least</br></wbr></br>  <br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA</wbr></br>  <br><br>Cool, thanks based anons<br><br> start from vol 2 at the very least <br>Why?</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>You will understand as you read.</br>  <br>Spookman is still a alright mage, his insta-gib stuff does debuffs if it doesn't kill and he still has some bread-and-butter things to be good enough at just straight up killing things when he's not being busy playing support-bot.</br>  <br>Just ignore him, start from the very beginning prologue. The minor details that the anime and manga discarded are nice</br>  <br> You will understand as you read. <br>But did I will lose any detail/info if I didn't read vol1 or it was bad translated?<br><br><br>Ok, thanks again</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess the book is needed to class up from a spooky skele mage to a lich. What else could he have become other than a lich?</br>  <br>It's probably in one of the D&amp;D 3.x books seeing as a good chunk of stuff in the novels is lifted from there.</br>  <br>A wheel skeleton, I guess.<br>At worst, he becomes Ghost Rider.</br></br>  <br>Death knight?</br>  <br> At worst, he becomes Ghost Rider. <br>Top kek</br></br>  <br> Papa Bones as a level 100 wheel skeleton <br><br>The mental image is simultaneously hilarious and horrific.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The only proper answer is to become a bone wyrm instead.</br></br>  <br>It's only worthwhile when compared to the enemies he faced in YGGDRASIL and other undead, but when up against pretty much any other opponent, Ainz is loaded with all kinds of incredible moves, such as all his summon abilities.</br>  A lich's soul is attached to his phylactery right? What item would that be for Papa Bone?  <br>To become a lich in 3.x you pretty much just have to create a phylactery; that requires a caster level of 11, Create Wondrous Item, 120,000 GP and 4800XP.</br>  What would the guardians do if Ainz announced that he would go adventuring alone?  <br>Reluctantly agree while praising the unknown plan Ainz has concocted that their feeble minds could never fathom. They would soon become stalkers of the highest order.</br>  <br>I do know that the orb in his chest is a world item so that can't be it.</br>  <br>Do liches even have independent phylacteries in this setting? We know that Ainz can be resurrected normally and the lich that was destroyed by the lizardmen would have automatically resurrected if it had a phylactery, but it simply died along with its body.</br>  <br>How does one turn himself into a bone wyrm?</br>  <br>They would put up a fight and pester him endlessly to try and send at least one maid to accompany him. If he still refused, they would have someone skilled enough follow him and keep tabs on him</br>  <br> stalkers of the highest order. <br>Pretty much this.</br></br>  <br><br>Dracolich it up.<br>Or just do what I did and  reform a collection of ground up bone dust from various species, preferably those with high magic affinity, into the inexplicable visage of a dragon's skeleton. During the bone creation process, you fuse pieces of your soul into the various parts of the skeleton and then assemble them together into the aforementioned dragon shape. <br><br>You have to then to find a way to keep the form together, there are numerous ways to do this but I prefer simply empowering the bones and possessing them en masse hence why I embedded my soul into them. Some have resorted to simply practicing bonemancy or utilizing a single gemstone acting as the heart to keep the whole thing together. If you did things right, you should be able to leave your mortal body and become a spooky skelly dragon.</br></br> </br></br></br>  <br>What's the source on that? I know he has a WC item cause the guild said it was okay but I didn't read anywhere that it was the orb.</br>  <br>So you used the bones as an unconventional phylactery instead? Neat.<br> also /tg/ pls </br></br>  <br>Stalking is highly possible. So is suicide.<br> “Ai- Ainz-sama, please agree to me, promise to me that you will never abandon us and leave this place!”  <br> “......I apologise, however……” <br> After ‘however’ , Ainz did not continue speaking. He had a particular reason for it, but Albedo assumed that his silence was due to something else. <br> “Why! Why can you not make that promise? Did you have thoughts about abandoning us already? Why! Is there something which makes you unhappy? If you would just explain, I will immediately remedy it! If you think of me as a hindrance, I shall immediately take my own life!” </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More or less he's an umber hulk</br>  <br>Isn't that what the skeletal dragons from Volume 2 are, barring the intelligence?</br>  <br><br>I'm tempted to do this but I'll just have to put it on my bucketlist. Gotta fucking find a way to to become a little girl mimic first.</br></br>  <br>but that's my point, the Eclipse CD is useless on a standard build that doesn't focus on instant death, so there's no point for PA to copy it unless he's going to fight as Ainz</br>  <br>Then what?</br>  Will we ever see Sebas' other eye in the anime?  <br>Undead turning lich don't have phylacteries. That's for mortals going lich.</br>  <br><br>You're a god damn skeleton dragon. What else do you want to do? Jerk off?</br></br>  <br>Receive a tier-7 lightning spell to the face and crumble.</br>  <br> Probably because they are in the game world somewhere. <br><br>Nah, they were the ones that hadn't left the game, but hadn't logged in the past 1-2 years. <br><br>All of them reconnect the last day to say farewell to the game and to the Guild. Ainz comments that in the first chapter. <br><br>So, since they logged out that very same day, I doubt they were anywhere in the game world or in the new world. <br><br><br><br><br><br>Also, he knows everything about the gear that is stored in his vault. It's not like he wouldn't be able to use the builds and equipment with a high degree of skill.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thri-kreen would have been the ideal DnD base for Cocytus.</br>  <br>I don't know. Get stronger?</br>  So is this entire show just about characters wanting to suck MC's dick?  <br>yes</br>  <br><br>Go fuck off and assimilate better bones or ores into your frame, refine the enchantments and bindings, and go find a dragon rider crazy enough to join you on your journey.</br></br>  <br>no mosty its start with hugging and getting stressed by his minions who keeps ovwethinkinf his orders</br>  Please tell me there's gonna be more lewd Albedo.  <br><br>Albedo is not lewd, she's just MADLY in love with Ainz.<br><br> There's a scene where she's naked in Ain's bed, but she's covered by the sheets. </br></br></br></br>  <br> ovwethinkinf <br><br>I can imagine how this happened, but I'm laughing</br></br></br>  <br><br>Minor stroke.</br></br>  <br>Best kind of good.<br><br>That and Good is Not Soft.</br></br></br>  <br>How about a skelly chariot?</br>  <br>sauce of this?</br>  <br>http://killsixbilliondemons.com/</br>  <br>wow I've heard Funi was shit but this is just..</br>  <br>Cool<br>Thanks</br></br>  <br>Sounds highly unlikely considering he carries a valuable item to revive himself three times in a row.</br>  Is skythewood the only translator or are there any who are faster than him and don't take the longer route by translating the chinese version?  <br>So the pdfs I had downloaded were versions 4/3, but now they got updated or something to version 5? What's different?</br>  Can skeletor even have sex?  <br>He can please albedo with whatever long bone fits her best.</br>  <br>Silian -&gt; Slane, Re-Lantier/Valencia -&gt; E-Rantel/Ro-Lente, formatting (intends and some paragraphing), some other terms that got more coherent during 4th vol that I might have missed.<br><br>So unless you're going to re-read, no need to grab them.</br></br></br>  <br> formatting (intends and some paragraphing) <br><br>Ah yes, I just noticed that. I think that I'm just going to reread the whole thing, the new format is very comfortable and clear to read.</br></br></br>  Is the light novel any good? Just marathoned another novel but that wore me out, if its good tho I'll go through this too  <br>If you're worn out I recommend reading it when you're revitalized. The beginning is quite descriptive and doesn't get into action till a few chapters later.</br>  <br>It is pretty good but not fully translated, no need to rush into it.</br>  <br>Sky only translated actively up to vol 2. He's credited as one of the editors now and lends the site as the dropoff point for chapters so updates are all in one place.</br>   The ammount of baneposting after ep 3 <br>Oooooh man</br>  <br>Nah, it won't be this bad...will it?</br>  <br>We can always get started a little bit early, anon</br>  <br>Tell me about Ainz. Why does he wear the mask?</br>  <br>Just embrace it, let it pass, and wait for the Friday speculah/Saturday chapter release threads.</br>  <br>Explain</br>  <br>Read the fucken LN.</br>  <br>You can almost copypaste entire conversation</br>  <br>Reading's for losers, grandpa!</br>  <br>Ainz puts on a mask and goes and wrecks some people's shit</br>  <br>But  why  does he put on the mask</br>  <br>You too would be kinda freaked out to see a walking and talking skeletor.<br><br>That's why he wears it.</br></br></br>  <br>To protect his virginity.</br>  <br>To pretend he's controlling dark knight</br>  <br>the only funny comic he made</br>    “Now it’s my turn to ─── kill everyone.”   <br> because the first two episodes don't have any fanservice at all <br>breast-groping</br></br>  <br>That wasn't fanservice, that was a necessary experiment.</br>  <br>Albedo pls</br>    starting fags  <br>What scene did it end then?</br>  <br>nvm, they ended it where I expected, on Gazef's arrival and the scout informing them about Nigan.</br>  Reminder that even Mibonga thing that Narberal is useless  <br>It's M'bonga</br>  <br>Da spooky voodoo</br>  <br>Probably the same as the manga.</br>  Fuck I totally forgot that today is the day.  <br>just fyi its laurentin that was changed to Ro-Lente</br>  <br>Yeah, memory plays tricks on that one.</br>  So what is ainz planning on doing with all those lizardman? And is this before or after Ainz  knocked 5 levels off by resurrecting him?   <br>Train them as shock troops and "squad commanders", each lizardman carrying his dead relatives as his squad.</br>  <br>He's not the hero we deserve, but the one we need right now.</br>  <br>Congratulations, you saved the village. What's the next step of your master plan?</br>  It's out.  <br>Indeed, both 1080 and 720.</br>  <br>Crushing this army. WITH NO SURVIVOR!</br>  <br><br>I can't fucking wait for volume 9.</br></br>  <br>Man, I want to see they religion they build around ainz and cocytus. They probably worship that one rock he sat on too</br>  <br> and this is the supreme ones rock young ones, remember to prostrate before for 10 minutes after each meal </br>  Well Papa Bones is huge as fuck. And DK even bigger hah.  Where's the Japanese live thread for ep3?  <br>Papa Bones is 2,5 meters tall going by vol 4.</br>  <br>Yeah, I always tried to compare him bit shy under 2m near Sebas/Demi but damn.</br>  <br><br>You see Dio. You merely adopted the spooky. I was born of it.</br></br>  <br>Damn he's a big guy.</br>   no Shalltear this episode <br>How is this allowed</br>  Fucking paladins.  <br>Mere chair doesn't need screen time.</br>  <br>She has a whole mini arc dedicated to her so be patient.</br>  <br>Bit different that what I imagined but damn, it makes sense. Fucking paladins. Even if he only acts for demi/heteromorphs.</br>  <br>Touch Me was a touch chuuni himself, considering his age and his circumstances in real life.</br>  <br>She has a whole fucking volume to herself.</br>  No censor Great job Madhouse  <br>thanks for the kancolle</br>  was it necessary to stab the poor knight many many times?   gazef is going to die <br><br>REEEEEEEEEE</br></br>  <br>They might still censor the brain splatters and intestines though, but I can take that as necessary victim, as long as the rest of dismembering/decapitation get through.</br>  <br>You don't ask the crazy, undead zombie knight questions that could make it even angrier.</br>  Anyone made stitches for this episode?  Can wait for Papa Bones lovely hugs.  So the ones surrounding the village now are the "trap" that the knight guy talked about at the start?  <br><br>Ahh! Yesss! I was wonder what would break first? Your spirit or your body!</br></br>  <br><br>Yes.</br></br>  <br>You mean it wasn't necessary?</br>  <br> streaming </br>  Oh dear, what a pinch.  <br>Didn't the guy stab the the girl's father many times in the LN? Seems like karma for that.</br>  Does Ainz have any NPC's he made himself? Or are they all other players npcs  <br>Pandora's Actor and Yuri Alpha.</br>  <br>Yesssssssss. That asshole clearly deserved to be stabbed so often with how it he was begging and pleading or people to die for him.<br><br>Next episode is going to be glorious.</br></br></br>  <br>He made Pandora's Actor and some hints on that he assisted on others (like Yuri since he is always referring to Yorumaiko with his p2w addiction) but his truly own creation is PA so far.</br>  <br>It looks like she's shoving her exposed boob into her sister's face...</br>  jeeesus christ whys gazef so fucking based!  <br><br>he only lost one level im pretty sure.</br></br>  <br> Ainz is a Nazi memorabilia collector </br>  <br> Ainz <br> A i n z <br> N a z i <br> Nazi <br><br>Aaaaaaaah!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Best girl. </br>   says his name <br> villager asks who he is 15s later <br>please</br></br>  <br>Why are you retarded?</br>  <br>Pic related.</br>  why is LN Aura so sexy?  <br>how does the resurrecting process work? I thought that those being resurrected would lose levels or because Yggdrasil is a sadist's mmo does the person resurrecting lose the levels or both?</br>  <br>doujins when</br>  <br> Not Albedo. </br>  <br>The target loses levels, default is 5 but Ainz hinted that there were ways to mitigate the loss in-game and it seems like Primal Magic/Ritual Rezz in New World are the same advanced kinds that mitigate the loss.<br><br>The Silian priests at 3rd tier or higher could rezz peasants but as Kajit hinted, her mother's vitality (level) was too low and she would have ceased to be since she couldn't take the cost.<br><br>And like with Shalltear, she was the target of npc resurrection which doesn't cost levels, just huge amounts of dosh.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really hope he speaks in a german accent similar to the major from hellsing.</br>  <br>Holy crap all their faces are so sensual.</br>  <br>I'm really digging the pace.<br><br>Nice and comfy.</br></br></br>  <br> huge amounts of dosh <br>so will papa bones be grinding for more cash now to make up for her shortcomings?</br></br>  <br>Chances are that they still have billions of gold left.</br>  <br>Shalltear's resurrection cost 500,000,000 gold pieces and by feeding single field's worth of grain to the Treasury's Exchange Box, he got 1 piece back.<br><br>So yes, you can call that grinding though I do suspect they should have few billions left if there were multiple mountains of gold in there and PA/Yuri/Shizu only moved some of it.</br></br></br>  i just watched ep 1 and what the fuck are you guys talking about  <br>He is already grinding the guild for cash because Yggdrasil gold is different from Re-Lantier mint.</br>  <br>spoilers<br>Shalltear dies. Pic related.</br></br>  <br>dude you have to tell me where you got the book man</br>  <br> Episode 1 <br> Episode 3 aired barely a couple of hours ago <br>Gee, I wonder.</br></br></br>  What do Ainz's rings do again?  <br>The heaps of gold on the floor had the lest worth in the treasury. If they really needed to they could sell off or grind some of the other items/weapons they have.</br>  <br>Sell to who?</br>  <br>Throw them to the same Exchange Box probably.</br>  <br>He has a shitload of Yggdrasil gold saved up so no. Later on he takes up adventuring to cover his minions expenses, saving the gold in his treasury for an emergency. He reminded of a single father when he was thinking how to divide his quest rewards among his "children".</br>  <br>Teleport around nazarik and shit.<br><br>I just realised how shitty the CGI of Death Knight was in episode 3.</br></br></br>  <br>Teleport anywhere whithin Nazarick.<br>Only intended for players in guild, after becoming alive anyone can wear it.</br></br>  <br>The guild ring gives instant movement anywhere within Nazarick to anyone who wears it. He has other rings with other powers, if we get to the end of volume 3 we'll learn more about them.</br>  <br><br>Oh shit I wasn't able to specify.<br>I mean the other rings. The ones he wore on each finger. Weren't they all highlevel items of some sort?</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure that you're wrong. Ainz wouldn't comment about the ring being possible stolen or make a trap that only activates if someone enter the vault with the ring on.</br>  <br>I can only suspect they're for "permanent passives", like his status of being resistant to immobility effects and his ability to use Priest's Greater Lethal (for self-heal purposes).</br>  <br>One of them is an reusable auto revive.<br><br> which he takes off when he fights Shalltear because he is retarded </br></br></br>  <br> Well he needed the resolve from the act of removing it.  He is weak like that, mentally.</br>  <br><br><br>Jesus, I'd be in fucking panic mode. With 500 million down the drain with every resurrection that'd be like at the least 20 resurrections assuming he has 10 billion gold. in the event of a absolute and total wipe he'd be looking at a very dire situation. <br><br><br>okay, so he is rectifying this situation by taking odd jobs, but couldn't he also get a large sum of money by stealing it from kingdoms or acquiring new lands and towns to tax them?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is Shalltear being dubbed by Amane from grisaia/countless other eroges?</br>  <br>He's in the process of making fields of wheat and throwing that wheat into the conversion box to make gold.</br>  is momonga mr skeltal  I just realized they showed a map in the episode. Any official map illustration in the LNs yet?  <br>One came with newest vol but no good scans of it yet, mobile phone img was floating around (and in the thread archive).</br>  <br>Yes, it's on vol.9.</br>  <br>It didn't take 500ml to revive Shalltear, that's how many gold coins he has in the Treasury. I'm assuming it only takes a few million at most to revive a max level npc for a dungeon so it isn't something he can keep doing with all the expenses using the facilities of the tomb to deal with as well.<br>And the money he makes as a Orichalcum ranked adventurer is already a shit load of money, more so than he would make simply of taxing some villages, his expenses just heavily outweigh his income.</br></br>  <br><br><br>What language is this translated in? French? I know the french are huge weebs, and my french is much better than my nip, so this would be a buy for me.</br></br></br>  <br>Official licenses are for CH/KR only as of now, iirc that is.</br>  <br> It didn't take 500ml to revive Shalltear <br>Yes, it did.</br></br>  <br> Shalltear's resurrection cost 500,000,000 <br><br>Where the fuck are you getting this amount from?</br></br></br>  <br>Bought with IRL money while it was still a game.</br>  <br>That was how much was transferred to the Throne hall as an estimate, we don't know how much was left of it.</br>  Is Momonga a bad guy later on? I'd rather not watch this if so  <br> There, laid a mountain of 500 million gold pieces, more than enough to revive Shalltear. <br>It was 500 million at most.</br></br>  <br>Skeletons are always good guys.</br>  <br>he's more evil neutral than pure evil.</br>  That was a massacre, by any chance is ainz fond of nazi's and gas chambers?  <br>well the requirement to be part of Ainz Ooal Gown guild is that you have to not be a neet and have a decent job. which mean everyone in the guild must have cash to throw into the game</br>  <br>Pandora's Actor is a Neo Nazi doppelganger that Ainz created based on how the Neo Nazi's fought a war in europe in the 2100's in Ainz's original world.</br>   No orchestra music always when Momonga is present <br>You had one fucking job</br>  <br>Wait until next week. That's the even more hilarious massacre.</br>  <br><br>I've played a lot of MMOs, and you don't get high amounts of in game currency with cash. Cash usually gets you items and perks.<br><br>In game currency you get with grinding, selling everything, and buying nothing.<br><br>Source: I'm a master of grinding and I'm always richer than Croesus in every game.<br><br>I think Momonga mentions a few time how he spent most of the time after his guild died just grinding.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is not actually Nazi stuff. Seems Europe went to war again at some point in the series past and one side adopted Nazi themed stuff. Though it seems they got the color scheme a bit wrong.</br>  <br>Simply put, don't bother him and he won't bother you.</br>  <br>Lizards say hi.</br>  <br> lizard man heroes </br>  <br>It's like you have no idea what you are talking about.</br>  <br>depend on the game and it economy, but you can also get item with high value using cash. This is heavily depending on the in game market and the situation, but it help to have cash throw in with the grind</br>  <br>AW SHIET</br>  <br><br>It's more like "Don't appear useful or threatening to him, and he won't kill/subjugate your ass."</br></br>  <br>Even with WoW you can buy gold now though those tokens.</br>  <br>They bothered him by existing, their own fault really.</br>  <br><br>It does, but like I said, I've played a lot of games. They are always set-up so real money to in game currency is a very disadvantageous transaction.<br><br>25% loss is the lowest I've seen (WoW tokens). Usually it's much higher.<br><br>And in this case, we're talking large amounts of in game currency. I can assure you 100% that it comes from in-game grind, not from real money. Real money is for items and privileges. It's even mentioned in the novels.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Guys.<br>GUYS.<br>What if.<br> What if it's all a dream? <br> He did close his eyes before the servers were supposed to go down.   Maybe he fell asleep and is dreaming all of it. </br></br></br></br>  Manga update when?  <br>For Ainz it'd probably be a nightmare really.</br>  <br>End of month.</br>  <br>Do we ever actually see Momonga outside of the game or does the rest of the series take place inside of Yggdrasil?</br>  <br>They are not in Yggdrasil anymore.</br>  <br>I believe this is the only part of him we will ever see.<br><br> UN LESS HE WAKES UP. </br></br></br>  <br>Depends on if anime shows more than just side profile of his Momon guise.</br>  <br>What if he's in a coma and Yuzuko and Yukari are puppets</br>  <br>not soon enough</br>  Tell me, /a/. Why does he wear the mask?  <br>What if the MMO and real life are the dreams of a skeleton overlord?</br>  <br> AW SHIET </br>  <br>Do Lichs Dream of Undead Sheep?</br>  So it seems being undead altered his personality to quite an extent<br> Does that mean if I log in as cute succubus loli, my personality will be all moe moe and slutty?  </br>  <br>Because he's a big skeleton.</br>  <br><br/></br>  Remember that the Ending is disgusting  <br> A cop </br>  <br>If you took it off, would he die?</br>  <br>It would be extremely frightening.</br>    tfw no new chapters in almost a year <br>  tfw new chapter appears <br>  tfw its time to wait another long-ass time to see another chapter <br>It hurts to live</br></br></br>  Finally a Wakabayashi thread appear, been waiting to post this.<br>Excuse the shitty redrawing, I suck at drawing.</br>      <br>Why do you type like an idiot?</br>      And that's it.

Some deities claim they are "originals" and were never mortal, but we have to take their word for it.<br><br>Essentially whenever a god decided to project his or her power on the world without doing everything themselves, they pick someone to be their Apostle. This means giving them some divinity, granting that person immortal regenerative ability and a pretty holy weapon that contains the divinity. That Apostle then has a direct line to the deity and receives orders to do whatever. Most of the time though gods don't tell them to do much. So they just walk around being their god's Avatar on Earth. Depending in the God's domain the Apostle get strange behaviours and issues, with Rory she gets really horny when near an active battlefield that is only satified by sex or murder, because her god is of war and madness. <br><br>Aftyer being a god's bitch for 1000 years, the internship ends and the Apostle graduates into a deity herself. At that point she leaves behind her physical body and become a god. She could choose to pick a domain of specialty that was the same as her host deity, or pick something else entirely. Up to her. The down side is that being a god changes one's priorities, as human desires are left behind. Who knows what really happens why you become a god? Are you really the same person you were before? Who knows.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I've become a Rorycon.  <br> as human desires are left behind <br><br>Hardy sure disagree.<br><br>And it looks like all apostles are chicks.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, she does want to become the goddess of love once she ascends. She has a definite girly side.</br>  <br> Rory she gets really horny when near an active battlefield that is only satified by sex or murder <br>Confirmed for being utterly impure. Dropped.</br></br>  <br> pina drawing yaoi </br>  <br> Hardy sure disagree. <br>Hardy is unusual. Even her own apostle don't understand why she kept talking about marriage, because it doesn't seem normal for gods to desire such things. At the very least there is a complete lack of understanding on the part of the mortals, with temples barely able to comprehend why their own gods do things or why. And gods tend not to bother waste time explaining anything to petty mortals, even their own worshippers.</br></br>    <br> Confirmed for being utterly impure. Dropped. <br>For what it is worth, she tend to pick murder...</br></br>  <br><br>Sounds a lot like Exalted gods and their the Apostles are just Exalted. Although gods can't change Exalted into gods like they can just normal mortals and Exalted usually can kick nearly every gods ass but how gods work and the whole giving divinity to chosen mortals is very Exaltedy.</br></br>  <br><br>You needed confirmation after how she acted in the humvee?</br></br>  <br>meant to quote </br>  <br>There's a difference between being lewd and taking a thousand years of cocks.</br>  <br><br>She sure acted like she wanted cocks though.</br></br>   anime cuts out Rory panty shot <br>Really now, A-1 is fucking killing loli since 2013.</br>  <br><br>They are also cutting blood, rape and people getting cut in half.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, yeah, but this is just a god damn pantyshot.<br>Not showing her gaping vagina.

Why has he just been fucking around all this time? Where has he been, seriously?"</br></br>  So how's the GATE light novel? Is there a translation?  <br>I wish I died too.</br>  <br>Tuka thought she saw him die. <br> <br>But no, Hodryu got away (he is one of the 12 legendary heroes after all) and living away from the village, has 5 wives, eight lovers, and countless women he's had sex with. Tuka met her newborn sister there. </br> <br><br>This volume also features Centaurs, Itami the Dragon Knight (using Tuka's spell to erase emotion), etc. Hodryu writes a book on this "Dragon Knight" that saved this land, adding to Itami's misunderstood heroism legend.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I saw people discuss how many dicks she sucked over those 960 years. I wonder how many people she killed.</br></br>  <br><br> And he didn't go back to take her out of the fucking well? </br></br>  <br><br>That sounds fucking stupid;.</br></br>    <br>   Kuribayashi snaps and tries to kill Bozes <br>The fuck?</br></br>  <br>He was amnesic from the injury for a while. <br>By the time he regained his memory, he was already swimming in pussy that he couldn't let go.<br><br>Oh and every single elven male in Gate are playboys. All of them. They're constantly looking for pussy to fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I was going to ask  too.<br><br>Also<br> Itami the Dragon Knight (using Tuka's spell to erase emotion),  <br>Wait what?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They're constantly looking for pussy to fuck. <br><br>This makes no sense.<br><br>If they were fucking constantly AND they are immortal, how come they're supposed to be rare?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because they're also sterile, mostly?</br>  <br><br>So that's how it's explained?<br><br>I haven't read the novel.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's how it often is to explain long-lived beings.<br>Either they don't fuck very often, or their fertility is so low that having children takes ages to succeed. Gate clearly goes with the latter.<br><br>After all, the anon only mentioned Tuka having one sister, but her dad having countless pussy.</br></br></br></br>  <br> <br>To overcome Itami's fear of heights, Tuka casts a spell on him that reduces emotions and turns him into a deadpan. <br><br>But the side-effect of that is, he appears to be this badass, calm, Dragon Knight not fazed by anything. So in their adventure to stop this conflict between tribes, Itami accidentally turns into a heroic dragon knight who will be told for generations as legend. </br></br></br> </br>  <br>It's explained in the novel that elves don't produce very often. As in, it's rare for an elf to be pregnant or impregnate. <br><br>Obviously to make up for this (or perhaps taking advantage of it) male elves are pussy0-crazed monkeys. Beautiful ones that is.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Maybe elf girls get periods once every 20 years or something?</br></br>  <br><br><br>I see, thanks.</br></br></br>  <br>More like male elfs being sterile as fuck, as we all know how easy it is for female elfs to get impregnated.</br>  <br>This is so fucking funny.<br><br>Wait until detractors equate him to Onii-sama</br></br></br>  <br> reduced emotions <br>even from Rory's teasing</br></br>  <br>because elf are like bunnys, they have a great nunber, in case of rabbits they feed other species, in case of elfs, well. they are sex toys for other species, got it?</br>  <br><br>Elves being crazy fuckers is a thing in most settings. Just look at pleasure cults in WH.</br></br>  <br>That's hilarious.<br><br>It's kinda depressing it'll take fucking ages for the manga to catch up to the novels...</br></br></br>  <br> The down side is that being a god changes one's priorities, as human desires are left behind. <br>So, she'd stop liking Itami?</br></br>  <br> boobs that look like boobs <br> in my Chinese cartoons <br><br>Blasphemy</br></br></br></br>  <br> So, she'd stop liking Itami? <br>No body knows. We know Hardy is obsessed with Rory but we don't know why. There is just not enough info about gods and gods themselves are not very cooperative in making themselves understood.</br></br>  <br>You'd think someone would be translating the novels.</br>  <br>Itami, the deadpan Dragon Knight</br>  <br>That fucking face.</br>  <br>The concept of love and marriage is different for Hardy than a mortal. <br>She wants Rory to meld her existence with her, which is the celestial way of having sex.</br></br>  <br>How's Rory taking him becoming emotion deprived?<br>Actually, why'd he become a dragon knight, if he's afraid of heights?</br></br>    I want to have sexual intercourse with Rory.  <br>He has an hard life.</br>  <br>Does he fug any of the elfs?</br>  <br>Standard medical procedure.<br><br>I was hit by a car and they cut my clothes off to examine me, and do x-rays, so they could make sure there were no internal injuries that could be made worse by moving me.<br><br>It's usually if you suspect there might be a spinal injury. Because lifting someone to move their tshirt off could fuck them up if they have a damaged spine.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What happened to my business-like young sage?<br><br>What's this kawaii thing?</br></br></br>  <br>How many dicks did she take in all those 970 long years?</br>  <br><br>She looks barely 12, not 16.</br></br>  <br> people still say this inane garbage </br>  <br>Rory was NOT happy, but it was necessary for the mission. <br>She's also worried because the long term side effect of the spell is, it could destroy Itami's personality forever. <br>Tuka has to turn if off every night to bring Itami back to himself. <br> <br>However, the side effect of the long term usage of the spell combined with use of sedative made Itami explode with glorious outburst. He went all berserker hero near the end, <br>He easily beat their best warrior in a spear duel, led armies and crushed the opponents, all in heroic glory (due to not being himself)<br/></br></br> </br></br></br></br>  <br>Bozes and the dude who fears yaoi, yes.</br>  <br>Delilah is best girl!</br>    <br><br>I think no one's translating because it's hard work. But the LN is also out so I also don't understand why.</br></br>  Isn't it a joke to compare the Yen to a currency like this? I'm not really well verse in economics though.  <br> None </br>  <br>fuck, now I wanna read the novels</br>  <br>Aliens.</br>  <br> Isn't it a joke to compare the Yen to a currency like this? I'm not really well verse in economics though. <br>As far as I am aware they use the price of gold as a converter.<br><br>The issue is that the Empire has very primitive mining capabilities and their gold output is low. This means they don't really have that much gold in circulation compared to Earth, thus their price of gold is inflated compared to ours.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'd gladly get crippled if it meant getting this as a compensation.</br></br>  <br>It's a jab at how today countries have more worth than in the past due to technological advancement and such.<br><br>That said, it's total bullshit how he would make that kind of mistake.<br>It seems that every Japanese writer has the need to at some point compare fictional currency to the Yen, in every fucking story, even when the comparison makes no sense. You see it all the time in isekai transport and reincarnation LNs.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Isn't it a joke to compare the Yen to a currency like this? <br>Not really, their currency is aligned on gold value like most countries did pre-WW1.<br>So you just convert their value of gold in Yen, kind of.</br></br></br>  <br>Yea probably since one country has a medieval lv economy and the other is moder powerhouse.</br>  <br>can't hope in gentlemen anons doing it now with the anime ongoing?</br>  <br>Suwani is gold standard. Yen is fiat money. <br>Since each coin in Suwani is 60 grams approx of gold, just pit it against the value of gold in the international market.</br></br>  <br> It seems that every Japanese writer has the need to at some point compare fictional currency to the Yen, in every fucking story, even when the comparison makes no sense. <br>But why wouldn't it make sense?<br>When it comes to repatriations, Japan would only care about the gold content in the coins. The conversion makes sense, the only issue is the Empire has far to little gold reserves.</br></br></br>  <br>the comparison makes sense since the character is japanese. why would an ordinary nip neet use the dollar?</br>  Lelei is pretty cute.    <br><br>I mean in general it makes no sense, within stories, because people who don't know a thing about money exchange pick arbitrary numbers for comparison in stories.<br><br>In Gate, there's at least a standard of the gold, but it's still stupid that a seemingly smart guy would make the mistake in asking for that sort of absurd money.<br><br>In this instance, it was just a jab at how primitive the Empire is.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Upstart nations wanting to get in on the Empire's new wealth by trying to out do them in negotiations with the JSDF. <br> A new gate discovered, that leads to a Sengoku Era Japan of a parallel universe (because we need to keep the nationality wanking to Japan). <br> A series focusing on Itami's children; the ones he had with Elf, Dark Elf, Pina, and Rory before she became a Goddess. Also features Bozes' daughter and Delilah's eventual child. Busty tits also finally having found a husband and having raped him for children. <br> Tyuule reborn because MAGIC and gods and on a road to redemption, suffering up until the very end, where she finally finds happiness with a simple chef. <br> A twist set many years in the future, where Japan now needs the aid of the magitech advanced Empire, and this time it's the technologically advanced but still war-loving Empire who comes to the aid of Japan. <br><br>Plenty of possibilities.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if that's how you chosoe to see it.<br><br>i personally think it's because they're at war. why ask for fair terms when you're the overwhelmingly stronger party?</br></br></br>  <br> mushoku tensei <br> make death lose its meaning <br>no thanks</br></br></br>  <br> but it's still stupid that a seemingly smart guy would make the mistake in asking for that sort of absurd money. <br>Japan isn't asking a gazillion dollars for the fun of it. Japan estimated this is the amount the Empire needs to pay to undo the harm their invasion caused. Similar calculations were done for both world wars. This is not news to anyone. And you can't have peace without repatriations.</br></br>  <br>But he clearly didn't want to fuck them over like that. He made a complete mistake. It would be like asking a country to day for 900 gazillion dollars. If that was what he wanted, ok. But if he was altruistic enough that he wanted them to remain economically stable, that's just a silly thing to do.</br>  So Itami just ends up on the Harem route, right?  <br>Who's the female dragonrider, and does she join Itami's harem?</br>  <br>this guy<br>also he did admit his mistake and said it was open to negotiation.</br></br>  <br><br>Who's Kengun's tomboy?</br></br>  <br>Beefeater</br>  <br>I want to get kill by her.</br>  <br> also he did admit his mistake and said it was open to negotiation. <br>It isn't so much a mistake as to put the first offer on the table. This is the X amount of gold we want from you. If you can't give us this then we would haggle for equivalents over a longer term instead. It's like telling you how much your student loan is in total before discussing monthly payments.</br></br>    <br>wait, when do these two get together?</br>  <br>you just said he made a mistake. i was talking about that point of view<br><br>unless you're not the same anon</br></br></br>  <br><br>Excuse me?</br></br>  <br>And the page when he explained it, he basically had to give a number, and he based it on WW2 calculations. He was actually going to go with what they could afford to pay, but he CAN'T just say "pay us whatever". To start negotiations, he needed a number.</br>  <br>Diplomat guy gets a loli?</br>  <br>Fuck that, I want my serious little sage. It's her damn defining trait.</br>  <br><br>When she becomes  abackstabbing whore </br></br>  <br>That's her name</br>    <br>What about the snake-hair loli?</br>  <br> Reminder that she will never win the Itamibowl </br>  <br><br>Oh, I pictured guys like this this.<br><br>It all makes sense now.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Good morning papa. </br>  <br>Yeah, that's not me.</br>  <br><br>A very capable loli, that goes back to living in Japan with him.  Her whole family gets murdered by inquisitors sent out to find people with ties to the JSDF. </br></br>  <br><br>On the topic of Beefeaters, do any anons know of any spoilers for the spinoff story where a gate opens in stonehenge?</br></br>  <br>All the Rose knights as well as Imperial family are based on alcohol names. <br><br> Pina Co Lada = piña colada <br> Bozes = Booze <br> Panache = Panaché <br> Vifeeta = Beefeater <br> Suissess = Suissesse cocktail <br> Shandy = Shandy Gaff <br> Hamilton = John Hamilton whiskey <br> Sherry = Sherry <br><br> Emperor Malt = malt <br> Prince Zorzal = Zorzal wine <br> Prince Diabo = Diablo cocktail </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Why aren't you posting more pictures of me?   <br>Why?</br>  <br>But I heard  the diplomat get stuck on the Empire's side of the gate? </br>  <br> No. She gets stuck on Japan. 1 year passes but 4 years pass on Gate. When she returns she's legal. </br>  <br><br>It's fun?</br></br>  <br> Why? <br>Because when you want to generate a list of names it is easier if you have a theme.</br></br>  <br>The only thing people like about you is your name, Piña</br>  <br>He does. During the gate closure 1.5 years pass on the fantasy side. <br>When Lelei opens a new gate to reconnect to Japan, 4 years passed on Japan side. <br>(2.5 years of time difference for the two sides)<br><br>So she should be ripe for eating.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>she aged like wine.</br>  <br> Right, loli stuck in japan, diplomat stuck in the Empire, is what I heard? <br><br><br>I see then.</br></br></br></br>  <br> No <br> empire's side of gate <br>I'm an idiot. I need sleep.</br></br></br>  <br>yes your highness</br>  Oh look a gothic lolita character, instant favorite? haha fuck off  <br> Well, what about my body? Do you like it? </br>  <br>She didn't really lose either. Itami hasn't done anything with any of the girls though in the different gaiden novels he had relationship progression with each of them.</br>   tfw no cutie goddess gf <br><br>why even live</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>What LN cover does that particular illustration of hers come from? Or wherever it is. She looks cool.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Patrick Colasour <br> Sergei Smirnov <br><br>There's a few other anime that did it was well, though with drinks besides just alcohol.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not just any gothloli, A slutty gothloli who cums from hacking people to death. <br>How the fuck do you not love that.</br></br>  <br>Smirnov is a name of a drink as much as Daniels is.</br>  <br><br><br><br>lol i just edit the 4 chapter of Piňa and i was wondering who the tomboy is xD</br></br></br></br>  Only the manga, anime, and LN are currently ongoing, right?  <br> xD </br>    I'm confused as to why people keep trying to say this series is propaganda. If anything, the bigger problem is the self-insert protagonist.<br><br>Anyways, I'm actually enjoying GATE a lot. I'm interested to see what direction it takes but even just "modern military in fantasy world" is fun enough for me.</br></br>  <br>The novels too anon. It's not done yet.</br>  <br>Oh jeez, I wonder if it's time to learn moonspeak now.</br>  <br>:3</br>    <br> spear user <br><br>Best knight.<br><br>Also, thanks.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> GATE, or, is this straight-up propaganda? <br> Did anyone else try to watch the new anime this season, Gate? I can’t even type the full title off the top of my head, but I saw a review and brushed it off (saw, not read), but watched the first episode with a couple of friends yesterday. <br> I got to feeling really uncomfortable, really fast. I mean, given what’s been going on in Japan and between China and with the US (and also Korea), I just wasn’t sure how appropriate this anime is…? I won’t really form an opinion one way or another about Japan and their military, but that show felt like straight propaganda, and it seemed to take an imperialistic tone right off the bat, and that made me a bit nervous. Not helped by the fact that I felt like they are indeed trying to pander to otaku (not in the usual format/style, though). <br> For a moment, I thought it could take an interesting route and seeing some of the manga scans, I don’t feel that’s what the series is going to do. Even episode 2 seems like it introduced its fanservice as soon as the female characters were introduced.  <br> Is this show as bad as it seems? Am I just being silly? <br><br> I'm confused as to why people keep trying to say this series is propaganda. <br>You tell me. There's more where this came from.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Itami hasn't done anything with any of the girls <br>I can't even begin to express all the wasted potential. So what was the point of all the innuendo and romantic subplots with Rori and Lelei, to the very least?</br></br>  <br> self-insert <br> all otaku characters are self-insert <br><br>I'm not a 30 years old soldier, nor am I divorced, or had my mom murder my father. <br><br>You guys seem to take the ONE single element that's common with the audience, and call it self-insert.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alphapolis should contact Intelligent Systems and Nintendo. They could easily make an FE game out of this anime.<br><br> Fire Emblem: GATE <br> it's a marriage between the systems of Advance Wars fog and FE with the new waifu system </br></br></br></br>   Never occurred to me that the empire would take some people as slaves during the first encounter.   <br>chinks, go home.</br>  <br> I can't even begin to express all the wasted potential. So what was the point of all the innuendo and romantic subplots with Rori and Lelei, to the very least? <br>The point is Itami gets everything thrown at him without his consent. Getting a promotion, becoming a hero, killing a dragon, having a harem. He never asked for any of this and would have preferred not to be in this mess, but he had no choice. The guy just wants to live a quiet life.</br></br>  Gate is the anime equivalent of erotic friendfiction.  <br><br>﻿Ｒｅａｄ ｔｈｅ ｍａｎｇａ．</br></br>  <br>He has trust issues.<br><br>Also most of the women after him have screws loose.</br></br></br>  <br>gee, it's not like ANY OTHER COUNTRY would do the same thing if they suddenly had a gateway that led to plentiful resources and fucking magic open up in front of them</br>  <br>Honestly, while Gate can lay it on a bit thick with YAMATO DAMASHII schtick, it's not anywhere as bad as most generic MURRICA FUCK YEAH military movies. The real problem is that, I think, most people are very uncomfortable or even repulsed by any nationalism shown by any country not their own, which is to be expected since nationalism by it's nature is predicated on an "us vs. them" narrative. It's just funny because Gate brings this out in weebs, who you normally don't expect to be nationalistic with the're Japan worship, but it goes to show just how nationalistic/tribal we all are underneath.</br>  <br>Is Itami the lawful neutral equivalent of Yoshikage Kira?</br>  <br>Wut? What happened?</br>  <br> weebs, who you normally don't expect to be nationalistic <br>90% of the weebs I've seen have veeeeery right-wing opinions.</br></br>  <br>He wants to get the 50 kills achievement in CG:GO.</br>  <br>Because why not.<br>Shotguns are fucking badass.</br></br>  <br> Why is this elf trying to have sex with me? I just want to be left alone to read doujins about having sex with elves! <br> Curse my fate! </br></br>  <br> it goes to show just how nationalistic/tribal we all are underneath. <br>And they cover it up with the "I'm not nationalistic, I hate all nationalistic material" statement yet love things like Captain America.</br></br>  <br> <br>She's sleeping with the 2nd prince, Diabo, and leaking him information through spying in Pina's Knights order. </br> </br>  <br>An elf with PTSD and another elf whose boyfriends always die.<br>'Gee.<br><br><br> but it goes to show just how nationalistic/tribal we all are underneath <br>Speak for yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The point is he doesn't want to deal with relationships. He is divorced, fucking an elf for real has real life hassles compared to dreaming about it.</br>  <br> Speak for yourself. <br>The next time some country declares to invade yours in a year, you better be out in the road protesting that there's no need to fight. Just lay down your arms and accept them so no one dies.</br></br>  <br> divorced <br>Wonder why?</br></br>  <br>It's obvious bait, anon. He's already been refuted in previous threads, he just won't shut up.</br>  <br><br>But there's no way the JSDF would provide it's troops with sawn off shotguns, where did he get it?<br><br>And no, I don't think it's part of their loot from the onsen massacre.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Risa felt guilty about marrying him "for his money" 'as she said in her proposal), while she actually loves him, but he doesn't love her back.</br></br>  <br>He was laid back even when getting divorced.</br>  <br><br> She grows up into an old hag <br><br>Fucking disgusting</br></br></br></br>   Lelei and Pina are the only virgins in the harem <br><br>Yao goes without saying, and Tuka was a sexually active lesbian. And I doubt Rory is a virgin.</br></br>  <br> Wonder why? <br>Because his ex-wife was a NEET who leached off him. And she got embarrassed after a while because he was a good friend of hers and she felt bad, made worse by him never complaining that she is spending his money and not being much of a wife. So she asked for a divorce for his sake.</br></br>  People dropping Gate have been saying it's because they don't like how Itami's a boring MC and that there's a disconnect between his otaku self and his commander self.<br><br>Is that a reasonable reason or are they just not accustomed to how adults would behave on the front lines?</br></br>   Self made man, earned his powers through hard work unlike every other hero <br> Punches way above weight class <br> Suwabe voice <br> Cool reality marble <br> A hero of justice <br><br><br>Archer is the best servant and true hero. You know its true.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kuzuki didn't need an NP to fuck Saber up.</br>  <br>Swords and reinforcement do not count towards the strength stat, else he'd have it as a specific skill like Saber. Twenty times is twenty times. If Shirou were to get that strong on his own, he'd already be superhuman.</br>  <br>Wasn't he 17 around the time of HGW?</br>  <br>Something like that, he's younger than ilya and she's 18</br>  <br> He doesn't know the way of the JETposting  <br>pleb</br></br>  Psycho-pass movie sells 35,697 discs in its first week.  <br>Not really self-inserting but:<br><br> "I try to keep an even hand with my characters, but whenever I come up with one, I try to keep one thing in common with myself, so I have a hook into them. So far I haven't come up with any characters that are completely foreign from myself." <br><br> Back to the topic, it would be very difficult for me to choose who I want to be from Fate/Zero because when I create each character I distribute my thoughts equally between them. Although, I do admire the way Iskandar lives his life. <br><br>His works are basically his internal conflicts, he vents because it's a cathartic process and adds cool stuff he likes and people buy into it because it's good entertainment. In a way he's like Anno. <br><br> Anno and Butcher are olev. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I feel like he's the character that he would most approve of if he still commented on the show if only for the turn he took in the second season which is fully in line with his own belief systems. <br><br>I bet he would have hated the ending though and the fact that Slaine didn't succeed in whatever his nonsense was, but the fact that he came to the conclusion that the only thing he could do was kill and torment his benefactors, seize power and try to fuck over everyone else in the cast for some scheme he claimed was for the sake of the Martian people, that seems like something Urobuchi would write not going to lie.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Butcher slaine was a scheming womanizer who plans on using the princess to get ahead.</br>  <br><br>Also possible.</br></br>  <br> I feel like he's the character that he would most approve of if he still commented on the show <br><br>Literally fanfiction.
