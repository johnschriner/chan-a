[ What I expected from Gate: Enemy spellcasters on the south are fucking shit up, our formations can't hold up to magical fire! Dragons are pushing back our tanks in the north! In the emperor's name, hold the line! Oh God, it's Cthulhu!<br><br>What I got from Gate: OVERWHELMING JAPANESE VICTORY! Watch as an incompetent foreign military is crushed by Japanese firepower. Watch as a society that clearly has wizards never use them! Dragons are pussies!<br><br>I was so hyped /a/.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Typical anime only faggot, </br>  <br>Are you that wizard guy?</br>  The lesson here is twoford:<br>1. Even dirty otaku can lead armies<br>2. Work for your hobby</br></br>  <br> not realizing that Japanese people will never let the Japanese military lose onscreen  <br><br>When's the last time you watched an american movie where their military is on par with another country's?</br></br></br>  <br>When was the last time the military of another country actually was on par? 1812?</br>  Bruh.<br>Your second line is why this show is so hype.</br>  <br>Go cry me a river faggot</br>  <br>I would have been disappointed whether I read the manga or watched the anime.<br><br>I wanted Imperial Guard vs Tyranids, not Join the JSDF, we can't lose!</br></br></br>  <br>Well, sucks to be you, especially if you are braindamaged enough to like warhammer</br>  <br> I wanted Imperial Guard vs Tyranids <br>The fuck are you talking about, where the fuck are the tyranids here, go back to /tg/ retard</br></br>  I thought this would be predictable generic shit but its actually pretty entertaining the interection between the characters.<br><br>I mean how can we hate a show with Rory Mercury in it.</br></br>  <br><br> Watch as a society that clearly has wizards never use them!  <br><br>How many wizards do you think they have? Is the Empire ruled by wizards?<br><br> Dragons are pussies! <br><br>I have no idea where you're getting this idea from. In fact, when when actually go fight the Fire Dragon, it decimates the elves fighting it with MC using modern weapons. They only win because of Leila's magic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you expect Romans with drakes  yes those are not dragons  to push back a 21st century military? And clearly magic is pretty rare.</br>  <br><br>The JSDF almost never fights after the initial battle. Most of the shit that goes on is political maneuvering.</br></br>   magic 4 lyfe tru wizrd fag is at it again <br>Please go already</br>  <br> drakes <br><br>They are wyverns.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't have access to my pc now so I can't check if they're actually wyverns. Have some pics?</br>  <br>HAHAHA HE SAID DONT TALK SHIT BOUT MUH WAIFU</br>  <br>I'm glad it's like that, I was worried this would be another dumb "ANCIENT TECHOLOGY CAN TOTALLY BEAT MODERN FIRE ARMS" scenario and was pleasantly surprised that it was not the case</br>  <br>Well, it's a drake.

Because it would be boring if it were Goku vs the kids on the playground. They've literally set this up as 'there's no conflict kids, everything's going to be OK'<br><br>Even the dragon was scared off by a rocket launcher. That thing would've gone down from a couple of tanks. I don't want arrows taking down a helicopter (seriously what piece of shit was that?) but is there any reason why we can't have a competent military vs a competent military? Firepower = different firepower?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The conflict is in the real world, anon.<br>I know you just skip past the political people talking and thats ok for you.</br></br>  Wizards are fucking useless against the superior otaku army of great nippon.

Archers vs helicopters is a things that can happen in Civ 5, but they sure as hell aren't going to win. <br><br>Thats why the pic isn't animated, and is just the still shot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I know isn't it great. Come on every other anime the military is useless and they get to be saved by some magical girl. Maybe Gate went a little too far in the other direction but I don't care, just let me have this one.</br>   the Rei clone is called ReRei <br> the goth loli is called fucking Loli <br><br> the refugees are running away from the "red dragon" <br> "fighting big monsters is JSDF tradition " <br><br>Fucking seriously???</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>That's the best thing about Gate though, guns and tanks shitting on elves and magic fantasy is great, it was the best thing about ZnT too.<br>The problem with Gate is the fact that it's a series about war and yet it refuses to show anyone dying or bleeding on screen.</br></br>  <br>How many boulders with the same destruction power of a big fireball a division of trebuchet can fire in the same time a single mage chant a fireball?<br>P</br></br>  <br> "fighting big monsters is JSDF tradition " <br>That not kaijuu reference like the one headed king ghidorah bit?</br></br>  So it's okay if 'Murica does it all the time, but Japan is a no no?  <br> the Rei clone is called ReRei <br> the goth loli is called fucking Loli <br><br>Their names are Lelei and Rory faggot, just because they switch their L's and R's doesn't mean that's always the case. <br><br> "fighting big monsters is JSDF tradition " <br>Most likely a reference to their Kaiju movies.<br><br>Why are you looking for reasons to be upset?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't use Leilei as example of mage. She received massive powerup after learning modern physics.<br>She is probably 10x stronger than normal mage.</br></br>  <br>Lelei power isn't the point here.</br>  <br><br> /v/ reaction image <br><br>You know this is worse than pepelefrog or feel bald guy shit right?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Caring where a reaction image came from <br>You know I don't give a fuck right?</br></br>  <br> just because they switch their L's and R's doesn't mean that's always the case. <br><br>It is always the case, learn 2 moonspeak<br><br>I'll give you the kaiju one though<br><br>I'm not "looking" for anything, these things are as subtle as a plane crash</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.<br>Because that "big fireball" is impossible for anyone else than Leilei.</br></br>  <br>then what is your point?<br>even lelei had to chant that long-ass incantation which she probably had to spend some time memorizing. whereas the common mage of the empire would likely have to spend the same time chanting that incantation to create a fireball 10 times less powerful.<br>Why spend the time and resources training those mages when you can tell a bunch of peasants "here, lift this rock here then chop that rope" and boom they can operate a catapult or a trebuchet. Given the discrepancy in training time vs ultimate effect its much more efficient to field siege weaponry vs siege mages</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty fucking confused why you think a reference to fucking Godzilla of all things has to be subtle in any kind of contemporary Japanese media.<br><br>Are you fucking shitting me nigger?</br></br></br>  <br>I said I'd give you the kaiju one, the lack of subtlety in the other three is a bit jarring, especially the red dragon one is almost cringe worthy</br>  <br>the point of that pic is exactly what you say, medieval technology is already superior to magic alone because it's faster to use for the same or better result.<br><br>What if i used "fireball" instead of "big fireball"?</br></br></br>  <br> I'm mad, because the anime realistically shows what would happen if a modern military engaged a medieval military. <br><br>~kay.</br></br></br>  <br>Burgers have this mindset yes.<br> "look at us only! please notice us! look at my Hollywood shitflicks about glorious americans conquering Middle East &amp; saving the world! How dare the other countries boast about their military?!?! REEEEEEEEEE" </br></br>  <br> Most likely a reference to their Kaiju movies. <br>If the king ghidorah comment didn't cement it that piece aping the start of the original godzilla theme should.</br></br>  <br><br>Let's see. Most movies about WWII and WWI have this. But I don't expect you to know actual history.</br></br>  <br>It's ok when murhihca does it because that is the only thing murrica has going for it, it is the dominating force on guns and fast food.</br>  <br>What's this faggot spouting, it's even worse in manga/novel</br>  <br> pre-WWII American military <br> Good <br>Pick one<br><br>The Soviets were on par till the late 70s/early 80s, some of their designs being superior to their western equivalents. Then they discovered you can't power an economy with potatoes.</br></br></br></br></br>  Itami is an idiot for not taking off his boots and socks before going down the well to get Tuka and complaining of them being wet afterwards.  <br>Wanting to watch shit.</br>  I don't get OP. Is he mentally retarded?<br><br>There is no nationalism in the anime so far. It is not like they had Japan crushing easily the other countries in this world and having Elizabeth II bowing to the Japanese Emperor.<br><br>It has the Japanese army defeating some medieval armies. Something that they would likely do without any problems. Or they should go full "American SJW that hates their own country" and having the modern Japanese army losing to primitives with spears?</br></br></br></br>  Thats your fault OP, fore watching inferior Gate rather than superior Drifters.  <br>Except Magic totally could defeat modern tech.<br>Especially Lightning magic considering how reliant we are on internet and unmanned drones.<br>Let's not even get into if the Lightning user can use Magnetism. Firearms of all kind are rendered useless, Manned Tanks and Helicopters being flung at each other. We'd be fucked.<br>Or how about a Fire Wizard that can snap their fingers and make something explode, or drop Magma, one of the most destructive substances on Earth?<br>Water Magic? We all saw what Blood bending could do.<br>Earth Magic? Crack open the Earth and sink a Military base before it even deploys it's troops.<br>And that's just the elements, what if some Dimensional magic user just walks up, everyone just tries to Dakka him and everything just warps around killing everyone else.<br>Or what a Time Wizard that can just turn everything into a fetus, bone and rust all the weapons.<br>Magic is god damn strong as shit. That's why you protect the mage until he's 20th level you Warrior/Archer chode.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just prefer them making it so that the magic using side isn't this all powerful force that the JSDF is powerless against like almost every other anime ever of this type. I think it makes a nice change.</br>  <br><br>Apart from Lelei exploding shit after she unlocked her cheat codes during the Japan trip and Tuka (a 165 years old High Elf) frying the Fire Dragon with electricity, I believe the only magical powers we've seen thus far are Myuute's when she deflected arrows at Italica, and elves boosting their arrows several times, right?</br></br>  Shit, I just want to see those elves get wrecked and the females enslaved.<br><br>Is taht too much to ask?</br></br>  <br>even if they had 5000 thousand wizards, gate magic cant outperform artillery, only after lelei learn about physics she can be considered a threat, and even then she cant outrange big guns</br>  <br>Surprise Nuclear Missile &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any delusions of magic</br>  <br><br> expecting fantasy creatures, knights, cavallery and wizards wouldn't get wrecked by modern millitary tactics and equipment <br>good one OP</br></br></br>  <br>science man uses hydrogen bomb, everything on a 40km radius is vaporized, then a even bigger area is destroyed because of the radiation, good luck winning anon</br>  I'll never stop laughing at this page.  <br>of course any deus ex machina magic can beat anything you throw at it, since it doesn't have to follow any rules</br>  <br> Magic could defeat modern tech <br>You know what magic can't defeat?<br> Modern society <br>The orcs would kill themselves after a weak of feminazi torture.<br>The adolescents will fap to hentai until they die.<br>The magic girls will sit in the lap of wealthy businessmen and stop giving a shit about anything.<br>All the elves become celebrated supermodels.<br>The dragons are all domesticated to eat mass produced pigs</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>BENIS OF STEEL<br>"bakblast clir"</br></br>  <br>GREAT IRON COCK<br>R<br>E<br>A<br>T<br><br>I<br>R<br>O<br>N<br><br>C<br>O<br>C<br>K</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>great iron cock&gt;rod of steel</br></br>  <br>The nationalism is a meme.</br>  <br> no nationalism <br>oh boy spot the multiculturalist</br></br>  <br><br>probably butthurt american so yes for the mental retardation part</br></br>  <br>Well, at least they didn't use "boom stick", or my sides would be in Saturn's's orbit.</br>  <br>BAKBLAST CLIR</br>  Rory looks so happy at the prospect of impending bloodshed, it's cute.  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ouS<wbr>cnB-F-6k</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Why is everyone so buttblasted that Japanese army is wrecking someone?<br><br>Are people fucking dumb or what?</br></br>  <br>That mage fucked up his chanting</br>  <br><br>Baiters and Americans.</br></br>  <br>BAKBLASTNOTCLIR</br>  <br>As an american I find this offensive, unless you are talking about 'MERICANS or unitedstatesians, then carry on.</br>  <br>Magic in most systems has limited range, is slow to cast, requires concentration and has usage limits. A modern army would obliterate an army of mages before they even saw what hit them.<br><br>As far as GATE is concerned we have not seen any high level mages (in terms of D&amp;D). There is a demigoddess that would be something like lvl 38 if you go by age but Lelei considered a master in that world doesnt seem higher than lvl 6.<br><br>Even with several lvl 20 mages things wouldnt change much. JSDF might take some casualties due to teleport/timestop and similar shenanigans but it wouldnt change the outcome.<br><br>A modern army in a medieval world is indeed a force comparable to gods.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just baiters.</br>  <br><br>I'm talking about people from between Canada and Mexico who shit up Gate threads with bullshit because America is one of the Big Bad Three in the story and Japan is not shown to be an impotent lapdog.<br><br>I do not know the difference between 'MURRICANS and unitedstatesians, so put them in whatever category you wish.</br></br></br></br>  I originally thought it was going to be a 1cour, but just found out yesterday its going to be 2cour. How far do you think the show is going to get before it goes off on its own path?  <br><br> before it goes off on its own path <br><br>I really wonder if they'll even get to the Flame Dragon arc this season, I doubt they'll have to diverge in any way.<br><br>And there's a shitton of content in the novels that has yet to appear in the manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly, America is one big continent, my friend. You are mad at unitedstatesians, just to be clear.</br>  <br> Thinks he's smart <br> Randomly capitalizes words </br></br>  <br>Get back to your hugbox. Cry more faggot.</br>   another world in a different dimension <br> French Maid outfits <br><br>Come the fuck on. Be original.</br></br></br>  <br>why are 40gay fans so retarded</br>    <br>French maid outfits are pretty much the pinnacle of maid uniforms. You can't top that</br>  <br>Gods Apostles are indeed the biggest threat the JSDF could face.<br>They are immortal but not invicible though, one of the times Rory got beaten her severed limbs had been chained for years, she needed help for recompose and escape. </br></br>  <br><br>But they could have had  more skin visible  with a different design.</br></br>  <br>Good old /k/ memes.</br>  <br> Blast the Apostle with field guns <br> Take her limbs <br> Hide them <br>There you go</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>There are apparently a whole bunch of shit you can do to a subdued deity.</br></br>  <br>Are you implying Mohmo and Aurea should be sexualized?</br>  <br> 40kid  <br>Fuck off back to your containment board, /tg/ scum</br></br>  <br><br>This is exactly what I am implying.<br><br>Mohmu goes nuts over the clothes Tuka is wearing in chapter 14.</br></br></br></br>   people arguing that any mage in the GATE universe can stand a chance <br>Not even Lelei's firecracker tier explosion will be effective, because they specifically state that JSDF Mortars can fire well beyond the range of their mages when giving a weapons demonstration to the senators</br>  So in what was is Arnus Hill sacred? Was it ever explained?  <br>Anon  Arnus got invaded by looking like tyranids xenomorph through the gate after a reconnection with another world, Itami even stepped in a room filled with facehugger pods and the JSDF had casualties too. </br>  <br>This, and mortars are considered short range artillery.</br>  <br>Anon, you're asking for the series to be completely different from what it is. It's like a reverse alien invasion scenario.<br><br>The entire premise hinges on that, if that's not your thing that's fine but don't ask for it to be something more generic than it is. I don't want D-Wars the anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Rory is born to be cute</br>  <br> but is there any reason why we can't have a competent military vs a competent military <br>Technological and tactical superiority. Drill and discipline only takes an army so far. There is no way they can win with that kind of backwardness</br></br>  <br>For once, Lelouch was not a faggot</br>  <br><br> you will never cavalry charge dirty indigenous people with your mates </br></br>  <br>Well she never seen jeans and t-shirt</br>   this smug cunt is now a character from a yaoi doujinshi <br><br>FUCK</br></br>  <br> elf maids <br><br>Welp, time to conquer and brutalise the special zone.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nah, right is human and left is a medusa.</br></br>  <br>I love this smug patriotic motherfucker.</br>  <br> Watch as a society that clearly has wizards never use them! <br><br>The manga already explained the counterargument against your hyping of mages. At one time, mages were superior, but as technology improved shields, bows, arrows, and ranged weapons, mages became less of a factor in victory. As tactics continued to advance, mages became yet even less a factor. At the time of PiÑa Colada, the modern battlefield had eclipsed battle magics. <br><br>Remember, there are no mana batteries or infinite spellcasting abilities in this world. It's not like your online games where you carry a ton of mana potions in your backpack to refill mana as you run out. And in this world, even if there was a mana potion, it takes time to wield it, to drink it, and to consoliddate its effect. You have been killed in that hysteresis time unlike games which let you look for, fetch the potion bottle, remove the cork, drink the potion, and discard the bottle in 1/5 of one second. I say 1/5 of a second because there is a game that lets bots slam down potions up to 5 per second.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you won't bully a loli medusa</br>  <br><br> I wanna get stabbed in the gut to get a bunny warrior cumdump like Delilah too. </br></br>  <br>Why you do dis to me, anon?<br><br>I just want to see the elf vermin conquered and brutalised like mother nature intended.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well they get eaten and burned to a crisp by a dragon. Does that satisfy you?</br></br>  <br><br>Say whatever you want about W40k, that guy's clothes would look normal on an Imperial dignitary.</br></br>  <br>Not the same guy, but I'll settle for bunnies.</br>  <br><br>He's clearly Zeon's ambassador to the gate world.</br></br>  <br>he was an imperial noble and a man who took slaves and whores out of the street giving them freedom,education, job and a home.</br>  <br>That's the only appeal to this show, and it's not JSDF-focused self-masturbation. It's modern military strength-focused self-masturbation.<br>Semi-automatic guns and artillery will kill a dragon. It's just a lizard. Grenades and missiles are better than magical fire, it's not like the wizards are on the tier of reality warpers.</br></br>  <br>What did you expect from a anime designed to recruit young folks op?</br>  <br><br>I know. I've read what's done of the manga.<br><br> I'm mad at Zorzal for the bunny genocide I'm mad because of Noriko. I'm mad because he's a roman Joffrey. <br><br>I'm fucking mad.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, in fairness to America, they have a lot to be proud of.<br><br>After all, they have the only special forces teams in the world that include black people.</br></br></br>  <br>but they can't set false flags because that.</br>  <br> Watch as a society that clearly has wizards never use them! <br><br>They would use the wizards if they could reach Alnus fortress gate. You notice both the Empire and Vassal armies don't use siege towers nor carry wall ladders and battering rams. Since they are obviously NOT stupid, this this means wizards would spell blast the gates down or blow a hole in the walls when they got close enough. In other manga, you might not be allowed to make that assumption. However, this manga seems to be written in a style where you are constantly required to "connect the facts" as the author seems to use that writing style from detective stories.<br><br>Except the JSDF had cleared out all the vegetation for 2 kilometers around the star fortress. <br><br>Wizard firepower? It never got close enough. If you thought your .45 caliber civilian magnum cartridges were awesome and were only just 0.05 smaller than a 0.50 caliber, think again. Civilian ammo is not the same as military ammo. A military .50 caliber bullet is approximately 5.5 (five and one half) inches tall when stood on a table. If you held one in your hand and imagine it shot at your body, it's quite different in size from a civilian 0.45 magnum.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Well, in fairness to America, they have a lot to be proud of. <br><br>Not only is the USA the only country to have special forces employing blacks, they also have the most prisons in the world and the largest amount of population living in prisons. How many countries have a higher ratio than 1 out of 200 citizens living in prisons? <br><br>The country of freedom believes that people should freely live in prisons.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Let's not start this shit here, please.<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br> If you thought your .45 caliber civilian magnum cartridges were awesome and were only just 0.05 smaller than a 0.50 caliber, think again.

Sharpen the tip by scraping it on the sidewalk.</br>  <br> Sharpen the tip by scraping it on the sidewalk <br>BOOOM</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Lelei has basically stated that everyone has been doing magic very inefficiently, and she got a large power boost by just applying basic physics to her magic. So just about any mage would get a large power boost with the same knowledge of physics.<br><br>Also magic can do things we can't do with our technology like making helicopters silent, so clearly magic isn't useless compared to technology.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The butthurt</br>  <br> stab somebody with cartridge <br> bullet is now pushed inside the casing <br><br>yeah great idea m8</br></br></br></br>  <br>/k/ here, just stop. You're not wrong in theory, but just stop.</br>  <br>yes support magic can be usefull in certain situations but destruction magic even with science boost is still too weak to counter a modern army.</br>  <br> Sharpen the tip by scraping it on the sidewalk. <br>Oh man.</br></br>  <br>You really hate wizards in this thread. /k/ fans are superior to wizard fans and Gate is good material for you guys to use on /a/.<br><br> <br> stab somebody with cartridge  <br> yeah great idea m8 <br><br>Mythbusters did deal with a variant of this where you put the cartridge on the end of a stiff stick and shove it into someone to set it off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> bullet and use it as a blunt stabbing </br>  <br>On the other hand, don't hit the primer or<br> pic related </br></br>  <br><br> so clearly magic isn't useless compared to technology <br><br>Of course not, but doesn't Rory  threaten to kill Lelei if she tries to spread her knowledge? </br></br></br></br>  <br>The knowledge Lelei was in possession of was hundreds of years more advanced than what the world had. Gods are very conservative about scientific advances so you can only gradually advance society, but japs would completely change everything.<br><br>Just the physics knowledge Lelei had would cause massive advances when they're basically using Aristotle tier crap or something.</br></br></br>  <br>Only because too much uplifting in a very short time is bad in Gods opinions, they thinks civs have to evolve finding their own path and not by following an already cleared one which would only subdue them</br>  <br>No, I mean just stop trying to throw out gun knowledge. Its not wrong in theory, but its not accurate and makes you sound retarded.</br>  <br> they're basically using Aristotle tier crap or something <br><br>You remind me of a  French  science youtuber who shits on Aristotle's "science" on a regular basis.<br><br><br><br>That makes sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Book titled "Easy to Understand Combustion" <br><br>Look, I'm no prime directive follower or anything like that, but, other than those pistols confiscated off Pina, do the Japanese have any filter at all for what they're sending back through the gate?<br><br>Between this and their monster girl idol magazines, they're just asking for trouble down the road.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>   les Dieux ont oublié d'e-penser <br>He did a video to say that Aristotle was cool once in a while IIRC.</br></br>  <br><br> hammering a 50cal with a rock <br><br>So they truly recruit them out of convicted gangers, huh.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Basically the japs don't care about anything since they don't even bother with quarantine or anything. They don't bother learning about gods or magic. Essentially they just want to go in and mine shit like complete morons. You could teach electromagnetism to a mage and have rail gun snipers fucking up japs.</br>  <br>Wait, so he used the flat end of a fucking bullet as a hammer? And they are sure he wasn't purposefully injuring himself to get out and get paid?</br>  <br><br> He said he didn't have the shoulders to take on his philosophical works, ever.  And that even if he was wrong so often, he actually thought about so much shit it's impressive </br></br>  Is she the next Chaika?  <br><br>It wouldn't be an A-1 action series if the fights weren't one sided as fuck so they could finish them up quickly and not have to worry about them as much and get back to the waifu harem stuff.</br></br>  <br>I agree. Any decent level 10 wizard would be able to mop the floor with the entire JSDF solo. Hell, a level 5 one may be able to as well.</br>   Why did they mention black people when Chinese and Russian forces have a potential of 0.01% chance in having black people in their elite force? <br><br> Why aren't rare and disloyal mages being militarized?  <br><br> Makng fun of your government leaders is making fun of YOU <br><br>Holy shit, did the internet turn into tumblr?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Modernizing the natives is a key element to engaging with them productively. As long as they're technologically backwards, they won't be able to maintain the political sophistication needed to have peace.</br>  <br> bullet <br><br>if he had been hammering with just the bullet, he would have been safe</br></br></br>  <br><br>Honestly she's not that great a character really. Certainly not even close to being able to carry an entire two cour show. It doesn't help that they can't seem to settle on a particular model for her and hold it down yet. She's probably going to be the first to get hit by the A-1 melt face since by the original arts standards she's probably the hardest to draw.</br></br>  <br>Sorry, I really lack knowledge on /k/ stuff. The most violent weapon I've ever held is a paintball gun</br>   <br>Idol magazines and shits are fine, afterall Hardy opened the gate for the purpose to let people crossing it ,breed and increase her souls income.<br>Tech sharing or mining are no good though but nips will learn it later.</br></br>  <br><br>Unicorns soundtrack was legitimately good, but that's cause Sunrise kept him honest and focused on music that would fit while other shows they just seem to try to use his breakout popularity from that one and he's now trying to turn out soundtracks that are all hip and modern and feature loud shrieking vocals and synthetic tracks and it just sounds horrible. He has nothing to do with this show at least and I really do hope that Owari is the last we have to hear of him for a bit but not holding my breath.</br></br>  <br> magic beating science <br>yeah no</br></br>  <br><br>Aldnoah had next to no named character death either, especially on the Earth side.</br></br>  <br>s'alright as long as you're not the type that vehemently defends his incorrect "knowledge"<br><br>those are unbearable</br></br></br>  <br>Marines are batshit crazy</br>  This shows literally being used as a recruitment tool for the JSDF as the diet moves towards amending the constitution to letting them become an active fighting force so I just see this as a thinly veiled commercial for that sort of thing. Meanwhile you have other anime that are kind of arguing against that move. Curiously political time for anime where a lot of the old school people are arguing out against the move while a lot of the new school and seiyuu idol types like Sumire Uesaka are arguing for it or at least defending it.  <br> Look, I'm no prime directive follower or anything like that, but, other than those pistols confiscated off Pina, do the Japanese have any filter at all for what they're sending back through the gate? <br><br>The author doesn't seem to care about the societal change ramifications. For example, he allows Leilei to go to bookstores to pick up books, and Leilei even gets an Apple laptop lookalike. <br><br>The control situation on the theory is that technology might not affect their society in a drastically negative downward spiral. For example, technology was exposed to Africans of whom many still have a subsistence no tech lifestyle. It's not like they all died from tech exposure.</br></br></br></br></br>  OVERLORD IS BETTER IT HAS A SKELETON<br><br>WHY DO YOU GUYS PAY ATTENTION TO THIS SAO PIECE OF SHIT<br><br>OUR THREADS SAGE EVERYDAY</br></br></br></br>  <br>that's a funny way to spell retarded</br>    <br> Aldnoah had next to no named character death either, especially on the Earth side. <br><br>Aldnoah was a marketing show. It's purpose was to show off toys and characters. Killing the chars off would decrease character goods sales or continued marketability for those characters which is a no-no from the point of merchandisers and license buyers.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'd watch Overlord if it didn't have people like you posting in threads about it.</br></br>  <br> The author doesn't seem to care about the societal change ramifications. <br>This argument again?

Maybe manga stuff in the 2020's.</br></br>  <br><br>Why do people reply like this?<br>It's clear that everyone here knows that everything the fantasy world has to throw at japs is useless because the author wrote it this way. The discussion is about why the author decided to write it this way.<br><br>I see these kinds of replays almost every time any wish fulfillment LN gets criticized. Do these people really don't understand what's others are talking about, or are they intentionally playing stupid?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anyone who first encountered the series in any format had the potential to think the same way, faggot. It's a fun premise wasted on nationalism wanking.</br>  <br>If you can't beat them join them<br><br>Overlord is literally more popular than Gate while bieng a much better adaption because it has blood</br></br></br>  <br> Stahp! You're not replying the way I want you to! </br>  I like it, good balance of comedy and more serious moments.  <br>I'm just wondering if people that enjoy LNs like this are morons. Because in general people on /a/ have at least basic reading comprehension skills, and I see these replays almost exclusively in LN threads, so I'm not sure if it's some kind of "I was just pretending to be retarded" in-joke, or just genuine retards.</br>  <br>Notice Hamilton's blush.<br>It was clearly The Great Iron Cock in the manga.

Guns invade a magical land. Durprise, it turns out to be super slow political intrigue on the level of fox news. Cina wants duh resoices, and russa too! Evil gaijins are no match for fat balding japanese representatives! But ok, you can deal with it, but then you have a fucking harem manga tied in to it. And sure, you could deal with gothic lolitas and elves hanging off him like dingleberries, but come on, the only reason dragons are even in this story because they represent the only threat to the modern military. It's gonna end with a massive dragon invading tokyo and dying. GOJIRA RAAH!   You will never amrry a fujoshit   <br>point blank I guess. Shit stops multiple AP 30-06 rounds. It's solid plating, not like soft kevlar</br>  Wheres the warhammer guys to fuck these nips?  <br><br>It would be too easy</br></br>  <br>why<br><br>if you want to see a conventional military getting rekt by magic and shit go watch any other anime<br><br>we're here because we like gun porn and military-centric stuff<br><br>realistically, war isn't fought on line of sight any more anyways. It goes like this:<br><br> recon team (ground based or aerial) sneaks in <br> reports position of enemy <br> CAS jets drop bombs from thousand feet up <br> squadron of attack choppers destroys everything from 4 miles away <br> artillery pounds the rest into paste <br> armor advances to secure the area <br><br>Any army that bases its fighting style on line of sight methods (melee or WWI/WWII style firefights) will get BTFO unless they go full guerilla and the terrain is extremely difficult and they know it very well (large cities, jungle, mountainous with lost of caves)<br><br>Only then will the rifleman become useful as a fighting unit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>So he goes to GATE world after the explosion?</br></br></br>  <br>For fuck's sake they barely beat that dragon, if it weren't for Rory they would have been reduced to ashes already.</br>  <br>So when he exploded he went to a magical world and fucked monster girls all day?</br>  <br>In the novels already fucking aliens, why no a warhammer army?</br>  <br>those are all shit animus and not violent generalization alright</br>  It's not just the technologies for war that have advanced. Strategy and tactics and logistical management have come a long way too. The Art of War is basic reading now and in only two hundred years we've come a long way from Napoleon. Even if spellcasters and dragons and tank-flipping mountain trolls were a match for the JSDF, they could still be defeated by outmaneuvering them, by hitting their lines of supply, by deep striking at their command tents, by gorilla warfare with tunnels and traps and hidden snipers looking for officers to shoot.  <br>then why not fucking ponies and the avengers while you're at it<br><br>if you want a soup just make it</br></br></br>  <br>He gets news Muh Ideals now.</br>  <br>Soon.</br>  <br>While Kou rotted in prison he was busy getting monster girl pussy everyday in another world.</br>   WH40K fags will defend this   <br>Just good old fashion carpet bombing would obliterate them. <br> Implying we won't just nuke their city and be done with it </br></br>  Ok everyone, Time for Sanji Hate<br><br>Sanji is the worst character in all of One Piece. All he's ever done is nosebleed all over mermaids in fishman Island and fail to kick down a door in Punk Hazard. He's really lucky that big mom didn't do him in. He's absolutely garbage and would gladly betray Luffy and the Other Strawhats for a pair of giant tits</br></br>  <br>No. Sanji s the new leader.<br><br>Mr. Prince is back.<br><br>Get hype.</br></br></br></br></br>   MFW next chapter is back in Dressrosa again   Delly is cute!  Sanji is the only good character. Please end your existence.  Kaido takes the expression "Whatever doesnt kill you makes you stronger" to a Whole new level.  Who is this guy and what does he have to do with One Piece?  Is there actually any evidence of someone eating 2 or more devil fruit and dying? I'm wondering if it's just a rumor, and you can actually eat more than 1, but people are too afraid to try it.  Kaido is Oz II<br>he was made immortal by the previous Ope Ope no Mi user<br>he eats SMILEs all the time in attempt to kill himself and that's how he ended up as 100-beasts Kaido</br></br>  Sanji thread?  <br>World government is pretty tyranical. They probably said that so people wouldnt become too powerful</br>  <br> 6 months of Sanji hats now <br><br>Fuck I wouldnt mind.</br></br></br>  <br> he was made immortal by the previous Ope Ope no Mi user <br><br>that's not Shakky</br></br></br>  I wonder if Sanji will ever become a decent character again. <br><br>Right now, he only does two things: get crazy for girls and kick people. He has become as one-dimensional as Franky. Didn't he have some kind of dream and motivations and unique characteristics that go beyond "I LIKE GURRLS"?</br></br>  <br>A friend linked a video, so I watched it and a few more after<br>It's a bit like watching gore, it's nasty but you're still a bit morbidly curious sometimes</br></br>  What if Brook had eaten a second devil fruit before he died. Would he die, get rezzed by the yomi yomi no mi, and then have the powers of the second fruit?  <br>A manlet Oars maybe.</br>  <br>I really wanted him to pull a Mr Prince at the end of Dressrosa.<br><br> tfw he probably didnt solo Big Mam ship. </br></br></br>  <br>nope, he would have exploded and lost both abilities, killing him for real</br>  <br>Sanjifags epic btfo</br>  <br>Shakky is friend of Kureha or Bonney.</br>  So are they on Zou?  <br>He could only conserve the yomi yomi no mi. The other would respawn.</br>  Why doesn't Kaido eat 2 devil fruits to kill himself?  Are they related?  <br>Probably.</br>  <br>He already ate 100.<br><br><br>Yes, Kaido is actually Oars III the Manlet.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kaido turns out to be green <br><br>yuck</br></br></br>  <br>Why can't One Piece just stretch to the end of the grand line?</br>  <br>Most likely, since the Pirates there were expecting Kinemon.<br>For some reason I thought Zou as a plain island like Long Ring Long Island.</br></br>  <br> he eats SMILEs all the time in attempt to kill himself and that's how he ended up as 100-beasts Kaido <br><br>I like that theory.</br></br></br>  <br>hes eatin 100 devil fruits<br>why do you think hes called "hundred beast kaido"?</br></br>  <br>I want Kaido to be blue.</br>  <br>I think the samurai they were looking for is the third one that came with Kinemon and Kanjuro</br>  <br> not expecting Zoo to be a jungle <br>Really?</br></br>  <br><br><br>If this is true, then Blackbeard would be pretty unimpressive in comparison. Most of us believe that his big thing will be three DF powers at once. If Kaido has 100 DF powers, then BB would be nothing special.</br></br></br>  <br> why do you think hes called "hundred beast kaido"? <br><br>Because he has a crew of 100 Zoans?</br></br></br>   the only reason Kaidou is so "strong" is because of his stupid personality gag <br><br> Kaidou in reality is weaker than Doflamingo </br></br>  I love this early introductions of crews, these two Kaidou crewmates along with the Doffy lookalike and Scotch are definitely becoming important in Kaidou's arc. Like Buffalo and Baby 5 in Punk Hazard.  <br> Unimpressive in comparison <br><br>BB has two of the strongest offensive devil fruits. As far as we're aware/speculating, Kaido has been eating SMILE which could have incredibly different effects.</br></br></br>  <br>100 Zoans don't really compare to a triumvirate of the most broken fruits.</br>  <br>Maybe you can eat more than one smile and not die.<br><br><br>In any case, it points out that its indeed Zou.<br>Law´s crew appearing when?<br><br><br>I didnt thought much about it.<br>Is there a reference im missing?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> being 1/50 inmortal is unimpressive <br> being the second man alive to eat 2 devil fruits is unimpressive <br>Also fuck you and your cerberus cancer theories.</br></br></br>  <br> Like Buffalo and Baby 5 in Punk Hazard. <br><br>These two were important? Buffalo did nothing and then was one shotted by Gyros. Baby 5 got a nice backstory and resolution, but that all happened in one chapter and had zero impact on the rest of the arc.</br></br></br>  <br> Is there a reference im missing? <br> Zou <br> Zoo <br>You know zoos? That things full of animals.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Also Zou means elephant.</br></br>  <br><br>Zou = elephant</br></br>  After all the hype, I expected Oda to turn Kaidou into a small, physically unimpressive dwarf. Or an old man. Or a little kid. Or an anorexic weed. Actually turning him into a big muscly guy didn't really shock anybody and there was no reason to hide his appearence. Too bad.  <br>Isn't that the official explication ?<br><br>I don't even know where this ''he ate a 100 fruits'' theory is coming from ?<br>Can someone tell me.</br></br></br></br>  Would've been more epic if we didn't know it was him until the end of the chapter where he'd be like:Btw my name is Kaidou, sorry for your base.  Remember when the Seven Warlords were all fencers?<br><br>Remember when Boa Hancock was sketched very early on? That dude with the stick legs and barbarian may appear in Wano and Elbaf, respectively. I think the gunner is Mr. 5, or possibly Scotch. <br><br>We're finally in Zou. Can't wait to see the Minkmen and Snakenecks. We already saw Bepo and Pekoms, so now all that's left are the Snakes.<br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>And no chapter the week after that.</br>    <br>He is, don't worry.<br>I really doubt Oda would forgot sanji or make him a third class character.<br>He's a part of the monster trio, faithfull to the captain, intelligent.<br><br>Mr Prince will be back.<br><br>  I love his sunglasses and new clothes tough </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Isn't that the official explication ? <br><br>I don't remember that being said in the manga.<br><br> I don't even know where this ''he ate a 100 fruits'' theory is coming from ? <br><br>He wants to kill himself and eating more than one DF apparently kills you. Aside from his nickname, I think that's the only basis for this theory so far.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Given how imposing his appearance is one would already assume it just ofr seeing him.<br>I think his introduction was done good enough.</br></br>  <br>I doubt it would've been that obvious if you didn't see the spoilers.</br>  So is Law confirmed to be the one to kill Kaidou? This might be why he wanted to go for him instead of another Yonkou, and since he was being provided by Joker it it was his golden choice to kill two birds on one shot.  Does Sanji have autism?  <br><br> Luffy trained by Reileigh, the right hand man of Roger and a person on par with admirals and yonkou <br><br> Zoro trained with Mihawke, the current world's greatest swordsman, who's strength is on par with yonkous and admirals <br><br> Sanji trained with a transvestite that could even destroy Pacifistas <br><br>Sanji fags, when will they learn?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone else think Kaido is kind of innocent in a way? Like sort of in the way Luffy is?  <br><br>Well in Moriah's flashback, we can clearly see his crew being made only of Zoan users.<br><br>Pic related</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sanji trained by a high ranking member of the Revolutionary Army </br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br><br>Fuck that's not Moriah's flashback but Law's...</br></br>  <br>I thought he choose Kaido just to fuck Doffy while at it.<br><br> yfw Kaido ends up with a Fate worse than death. </br></br></br>  <br>Nah, it seems more like he's old and jaded.</br>  <br><br>Sanji trained with one of the most trusted man by the most dangerous criminal on the planet.</br></br>  <br> This might be why he wanted to go for him instead of another Yonkou <br><br>He never wanted to go for him. He just told this to Luffy so that he would come along and help him against Doffy. His initial plan was to destroy the SMILE factory so that Kaido would kill Doffy.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Sanji trained with a transvestite that could even destroy Pacifistas <br>Nigga, don't disparage Ivankov.<br><br> is able to hold off Magellan with a crippled transexual in his afro and escape without any lasting injuries <br> it takes Blackbeard, his entire crew, the previous warden, and several level 6 prisoners to beat Magellan <br>Not to mention Ivankov is probably the strongest revolutionary (though I imagine Dragon has that crazy kung fu like Sabo).</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaido is the only character who could make Shanks waste all his Haki.<br>So if Kaido does attack Shanks, I don't think BB would get a better chance than that.</br></br>  <br> Mihawke, the current world's greatest swordsman, who's strength is on par with yonkous and admirals <br>wha?</br></br>  <br>When the hell are the Heart pirates going to meet up with the Strawhats? I need this development.</br>  Was there any actually satisfying fight in Dressrosa?<br><br>The Doffy family either got one shotted only to putz around later on or they got a fight with one of the gladiators that ended in half a chapter defeat. <br>You had shit like Lao G beating the fuck out of the dwarves but then he ended up being relegated to "funny old men fight".<br><br>The only fight with any weight behind it was Franky VS Senor Pink and that was broken up into HARD BOILED gags throughout 40 chapters worth of padding.<br><br>All the Elite Officers had really lackluster fights with Trebol and Diamante doing dumb prop fights that belonged back in East Blue (the iron rain was some fucking Krieg tier garbage). Pica was the only one (besides Pink) who put up a fight and that was really just him swatting at shit until Zoro almost on shot him.<br><br>The gladiator fights had more impact to them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Reileigh can fight equally with Kizaru <br><br> Mihawk can fight equally with Shanks <br><br> Ivankov gets one-shotted by Akainu </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope soon.</br>  <br>Ivankov fought Bartholomew evenly.</br>  <br>Rayleigh cut Kizaru's face.

Is Yggdrasil actually a multi-dimensional portal? And why only when the game's getting shut down? Why to different time periods in the New World?  <br>As expeced of Ainz-sama!

The head maid is a homoculous that has the body of a woman and the head of a dog.   No Gagaran art in Pixiv <br> No Gagaran art in Deviantart <br> No rule 34 at all </br></br>  <br>No</br>  <br>Why?</br>  <br>give me Narberal</br>  <br>5-6 or DEATH!</br>  <br>No one cares about those maids anon.</br>  So what makes retard meido so retarded?  <br>...why not?</br>  Whoa, what happened with the sales ranking? It's #2 in the season chart.  <br>Lets do this</br>  <br>She keeps making the same mistake over and over again despite its consequences being a security risk to Nazarick as a whole. Not to mention that Papa Bones keeps letting her know that she's fucking up.</br>  <br>I care about them, faggot</br>  <br>I guess talking about what could happen in Overlord is better than GATE.</br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>Fug.<br>I'll still watch it.</br></br>  <br>Didn't think it would this popuplar.<br>http://www27392u.sakura.ne.jp/index<wbr>_news.cgi<br>It's only losing to Symphogear.</br></wbr></br></br>  Overlord? More like Overrated!  <br>How humerus.</br>  <br>That's pretty moe</br>  <br>For you.</br>  <br> only losing to Symphogear <br><br>i thought Sympho was a niche?</br></br></br>  <br><br>No bully pls</br></br>  <br>that tickled my funny bone</br>    <br>Nope. First season was lukewarm but the 2nd one if I remember topped the charts, selling much more than the previous one. 3rd season is even better.<br> Nana wills it. </br></br>  <br>I don't think he ever will. Aniz isn't that smart enough to comprehend the science involved to make this happen. Even if he does it probably be just "magic".</br>      <br>pls, even normal fags keeps complaining how "evil" the mc and how "violent" his actions are.</br>  <br>Who is that on the right?</br>  Can they do enough with 13 episodes? Will there be more?  <br>it pretty underrated compared to Gangsta,gakkou gurashi, monster musume so far though..</br>  <br>Not enough with 13. and most likely there wont be any more seasons.</br>  <br>Leader of Blue Rose.</br>  <br>Someone should really add Ainz reaction to that.</br>  <br>The Blue Rose leader, i believe.</br>  <br>Thank you</br>  <br>Oh wow i knew Season 1 was considered a cult classic, didn't know season 2 was so popular <br><br>[Spoiler]praise Nana[/Spoiler]</br></br></br>  <br>Anyone have a screenshot of Papa Bones looking smug? I need it for reasons.</br>  <br>Someone said that's barely enough for the Chair Rebellion, right? I kinda wanted to see Fai-I mean, Lizard Tail.</br>  <br>This one?</br>  <br>I was hoping for something larger, but that might work.</br>  <br>I think we are just going to get to Vol 3 since it is a high note for the series until everything settles down in the later volumes,</br>  <br>Arent they doing 4 eps per Vol? So what would the 13th ep be about?</br>  <br>Maybe Ainz giving them their orders that'd lead to the future volumes that'll never get animated.<br>"IF YOU WANT MORE PAPA BONES, BUY THE LIGHT NOVEL!"</br></br>  <br>5 episodes devoted to volume 3. Hopefully.</br>  <br>Reminder that Lakyus is as big of a chunni as Momonga or Ulbert.</br>  <br>ED Song on loop for 24 mins</br>  <br>Momonga's too beta to be chuuni.</br>  <br>This suit you?</br>  <br>He was a chuuni, hes almost 30 now so he isnt anymore.</br>  <br>Yes, it's perfect.</br>  I wish I could stand reading the LN, but it's just too slow.  <br>No more autotune. PLEASE.</br>  <br>Is this your first time reading something since high school?</br>  <br>Lucky number 5/6?</br>  <br>20 minutes of Ainz awkwardly using his new chair, while said chair is orgasming constantly.</br>    <br>Maybe.</br>    <br>Can't you give her your love and passion?</br>  <br>As a real punishment, Ainz should have let Albedo sit on the chair.</br>    <br>Anything, but retardberal please<br><br><br>Only Entoma and Solution are confirmed to, but Lupus probably as well.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Chair would probably enjoy that almost as much, that's only punishment for Albedo.</br>  <br>He doesn't chair-ify her until after lizardmen.</br>  This show has some real potential.<br><br>  I can't wait someone to make lewd skeleton art. </br></br>  <br>She eats them yes, but unlike Retardberal and Solution she doesnt hate them and outside eating them actually gets along with them just fine.</br>  <br>Oh, that's a cool looking sword</br>  <br>Then who the hell are these three?</br>  <br>Fucking Christ, that's what I get for tempting fate!<br><br><br>Some of the random, non-pleidades maids in nazarick.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Take your Retard bunny maid like a good anon now. She could work well enough if youre into humiliation play, otherwise youre out of luck.<br><br>Shizu please</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lupus fine too, im on the M side anyway.</br>  Y'know, with Overlord's art covers, I wouldn't find the novels out of place if I saw them in the fantasy section of Barnes &amp; Nobles or something.  <br>True dat</br>  <br>They're literally fantasy novels, light or otherwise. You can read these things in public and the worst thing anyone will think of you is that you're a nerd.</br>  Can someone tell me whats with the time and date that comes up every chapter in vol 5?<br>They weren't there in the earlier volumes</br>  <br>Because it's following their days</br>  <br>Nah. Gate has tons of theorycrafting that people can make on a worldwide scale BUT it's also the go to target for shitposting, retards, trolls that claim any criticism is butthurt america, trolls in general, irc, pol, and all things awful to the point any discussion is overwhelmed in a sea of shit.</br>  <br>This, I'm pretty sure one could get along fine with her so long as you brought along some "snacks" for her. Probably could convince her to go on a picnic if you are a fag like me and into that shit.<br>I wouldn't say Solution "hates" humans, anon. They are her favorite food/toys after all.<br><br><br>Ooookaaaay, I guess I'll settle for some retard moe. At least my last moments will be electrifying~.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A-anon where is that tail placed?</br>  Best  <br>Apparently it's so that we can work out whats going on behind the scenes in vol 5 and 6.</br>  <br><br>None of the girls are best, they all hate Humans or want to eat them, and speaking as a Human, I do not wish to be eaten.</br></br>  <br>Yes? Part of set of three transformation spells that turn females into pic related.</br>  Guys. Volume 4 chapter 2<br> “Why did Ainz-sama set some times when it cannot be used?” <br> Ainz-sama ordered that the times 7:21 and 19:19 can not be set as alarm time. <br><br>I understand 19:19 from seitokai yakuindomo, but what about 7:21 ?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Weeell she does look down on them heavily and mainly sees them as pests to be exterminated, like Tsuare. Considering Ainz put her on 2 most dangerous Pleiades (for humans) along with Retard instead of Entoma.</br>  <br><br> implying  <br>Robot meido likes humans, fuck off shit taste</br></br></br>  Random kind of related question. I was planning on buying some kindle ln/manga to try ripping and uploading. Anyone know of some series that have digital english copies they want to see? I can't think of anything that had it's translations stopped from being licensed other then triage X and some other anons already did that. Any suggestions?  <br>Yuri-nee, Pestonya and Shizu-chan all like humans. Take your shit taste somewhere else thank you very much.</br>  <br>Dammit anon you were supposed to say it was a butt plug</br>  <br> 7:21 <br>"Not everyone who calls out to me, 'Lord! Lord!' will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Only those who actually do the will of my Father in heaven will enter.</br></br>  <br>7 = Na(na), Shi(chi)<br>2 = Fu(ta), Ni, Ji<br>1 = Hi(to), I(chi), I(tsu)<br>No idea if any combination works. Could be something else, of course.</br></br></br></br>  <br> not wanting to meet a glorious end satisfying the appetite or boredom of a superior heteromorphic race meido/guardian <br>see  and  for other reasons why you have shit taste</br></br>  <br><br> liking human fangirls <br>Disgusting.</br></br></br>  Watching NotGuts wreck shit was extremely pleasing.  <br> Not liking Shizu-chan. <br>This goes way past and beyond shit taste into Hopelessly shitty taste territory.</br></br>  <br>07:21 = onani = masturbation</br>  <br>Good taste.</br>  <br>ah i get it, thats smart.</br>  <br>keked<br><br>someone was saying it could be read as "onani" few days ago AKA "it's fap time!"</br></br></br>  <br>You're basically into scat at this point anon.</br>  I think there's a realistic chance of second season.<br>The novel is selling like crazy. It's sold out on amazon and in a lot of local stores too</br>  <br>Ah. forgot to count the 0.</br>  Tfw never hearing Chagamas recorded alarm for 19:19.  <br>Simmering Teapot, not chagama.</br>  <br>mb in a couple of years</br>  <br>Bukubuku Chagama = Simmering Teapot</br>  <br>multiple perspectives happening at various times</br>    <br>Shit, so thats the translation huh.</br>  yfw the chair has a smaller chest then the actual child  <br>Let's see.</br>  <br> Gazef is based as fuck <br> remember that this is Overlord <br><br>he is going to die isnt he</br></br></br></br>  <br>Buggirl aww yiss.</br>  <br>They're human. Of course they do.</br>  <br>Nah he wouldnt he is such a bro and the strongest human there is   Ofc he is going to die </br>  <br> Vol9 </br>  <br>I thought papa bones was cool with the girl and even lets her stay in Nazarick as an apprentice maid?</br>  <br>She does stay</br>  <br> Overlord is becoming mainstream  <br>I'm not sure how I feel about this.</br></br>  <br>Maruyama isn't suddenly gonna write any differently, Martin didn't suddenly stop with horny teenagers masturbating for 5 pages just because he became mainstream.</br>  <br>Oh boy,  in the most Ainz way possible, he will. Utterly dead, without a single atom of chance to do anything. After giving off a heroic speech about how he would at least try to do anything, he gets stopped by Ainz time-stopping ability. Bones then sets off a delayed instant kill spell that goes off the moment the time-stop ends, thus making it look like Gazef suddenly died right after his charge, without doing anything. </br>  <br>I feel hope for a second season.</br>  <br>So Bin might make an art book.</br>  <br> second season <br><br>I dunno, how are they going to cover lizardmen arc well?</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's Madhouse, that's guaranteed to have no 2nd season.</br></br>  <br> His fans killed Arche. I don't know anon. </br>  <br>It will never be that mainstream, I think. Just 4 episodes and people are screaming "OP pls nerf". Imagine what they'll do when they find out it's been 9 volumes and he's never even come close to being defeated.</br>  <br>Thats deliciously evil.</br>  <br>If there's a BD bonus with a So-bin artbook I'm buying it.</br>  <br>Oh god anon don't tease me</br>  <br>All of my money</br>  <br> The spider maid is eating a fried human arm </br>  Yuri Alpha best maid, second ks naberal. Get over it peasants.  <br>Sometimes, I believe Ainz was created just so Maruyama would show his dislike or irritation with the whole "heroes never die" or "friendship is magic" tropes. Ainz is literally the trope killer. Let's see what other cliched tropes he'll kill in volume 10.</br>  <br> So Bin might make an art book. </br>  <br>4 episodes of Lizard mating rituals with all of Nazarick watching like Nat Geo</br>  <br>Wait till you notice the earlobes, fingers and Brain jelly.</br>  <br>I will sacrifice myself</br>  Best girl is here<br><br>Bow down, peasants.</br></br>  <br>He was going to make her life miserable anyway. I don't see much difference in what happened in the LN and the WN.</br>  <br>I wouldn't say her danger comes so much from disdain as from humans being "tasty and fun" to her. She even remarks that Tsuare looked like neither. She wouldn't have gone out of her way to request some "pure ones" from papa bones otherwise.</br>  <br>Well even with all sexual abuse she would atleast have taught Papa-bones how to dance. Now she is wall ornament.</br>    <br>She gets fucked by a chair in the WN.</br>  <br> martin <br><br>What series was this?</br></br></br>  <br> Post chair <br> call it a girl </br></br>  <br>Remember, no happy endings</br>  <br>That chair looks awfully comfortable with all the extra stuffing.</br>  <br>Aw, wanted Yuri. At least I got Lupus.</br>  <br>SoIaF</br>  <br>Lucky bastard</br>  <br>I need this</br>  <br>Good thing that whole course of action was scrapped. I didn't want Ainz to become a noble of the Empire anyway.<br><br><br>Yeah, I don't remember reading/hearing she was happy as a slave.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>C-can you spell that out please?</br>  Do the laws of physics apply in this world or is weapon strength determined not by the materials or the construction but by arbitrary stats attached to it by Yggdrasil devs?  <br>so who is her superior? maybe solution or sebas? did she meet papa bones?</br>  thinking of picking this up<br>which ones are the good subs?</br>  <br>Song of Ice and Fire.</br>  <br>As expected of Ainz-sama! A paragon of lordly caliber!</br>  <br>King of terror is a better dance partner anyway</br>   SEASON 2 <br> SHALLCHAIR ANIMATED <br><br>Pls</br></br></br>  <br>Sebas is her superior and also her trainer</br>  <br> Martin didn't suddenly stop...just because he became mainstream. <br>You're right, he did it before.</br></br>  <br>Just google it you Narberal.</br>  <br>Oh you mean GRRM reaper<br><br>Thought we were talking about mangos</br></br></br>  <br> In order to gain the strength to accomplish his goal, he needed a weapon. He was willing to throw away everything else for the weapon of his desires. <br><br> Magic weapons were expensive, but the one he truly wanted wasn’t any ordinary magic weapon. <br><br> Further south, past the Kingdom—was a city in the middle of a desert. <br><br> Amongst the goods that occasionally flowed out from that city was a weapon that, even unenchanted, far surpassed the cutting ability of ordinary magic weapons. <br><br> It had a price to match, so much so that people’s eyes would pop out of their sockets upon seeing it. That was the weapon he wanted. <br><br> And then, he had finally managed to obtain a 「Katana」. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>THE STRONGEST WEAPON<br>FOLDED A THOUSAND TIMES<br>NIPPON STEEL</br></br></br>  <br>I really hope we get chair as part of the epilogue.</br>  <br> check normies websites <br> bunch of retards complaining how brutal and "Evil" MC is <br> most are retards expecting booby fanservices due to ep 1 <br> rankings overlord is on the 15-20 place <br>its good they are dropping it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He get's a lot of shit for that, but when you think about it it really does make sense why he chose that.</br>  <br>Even the retard bunny she is, that disinterested look and black ponytail still set my loins on fire.  Shizu a best Pleiades </br>  <br>Can't wait for the hug.</br>  <br>I still think  Gazef  made a huge mistake, sacrificing himself for a kingdom that's been mostly taken over by a psychotic girl who's only chain to morality is FUCKING CLIMB.<br><br>This does have a lot more impact than in the WN where  Raeven  was the one killed off.</br></br></br>   Just finished reading Volume 4 <br> Lizardmen and their typical Shounen power of friendship, love, family, hope and dreams and etc <br> Papa Bones and Cocytus crushes all of that in a single encounter <br><br>Goddamn, that is overkill<br><br><br>what, really?<br><br>like where</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One advantage ln fags have over secondaries is that the author spells out in volume one how the series will be.</br>  <br>More like she'll bow down so one can sit on her.</br>  <br>That's a machine, not a girl.</br>  <br> the whole thing was just an experiment anyways <br><br>And they tried so hard too</br></br></br>   Tfw you'll never pledge alliance to Ainz   <br>ahh, such great evil :D I like it<br><br><br>I'm also getting sick of heroes protecting the weak from evil to gain power to protect friends this series and light novel really freshens my guilty pleasure</br></br></br></br>  <br>I still can't believe based big bro was not rezzed. I hope he comes back, I liked his relationship with his little bro.</br>  <br> bunch of retards complaining how brutal and "Evil" MC is <br>what the fuck are they expecting from a skelly mc? a hero that gives big hugs to everyone? fucking retards</br></br>  <br> :D <br>Kill yourself you fucking faggot. Don't do that shit here.</br></br>      <br>He does gives a big hugs to Cletimente.</br>  <br><br>couldn't even give the shallchair a manicure; what a fuckin scrub</br></br>  Wait, so Ainz can invite you to Nazarick but can't/won't make you a member of AOG?<br><br> I like that. </br></br>  <br>Now you had to go and make me sad.</br>  <br> tfw inferior human creature <br> tfw I cannot fight for and serve Ainz-sama <br> tfw not even fit to be a servant </br></br></br>  Daily reminder that Asuka &gt; Rei  Why would anyone like Rei. She's not even human  <br>Daily reminder that there is no need to have this thread everyday.</br>  <br>FACT THREAD<br>A<br>C<br>T<br><br>T<br>H<br>R<br>E<br>A<br>D</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Daily reminder that Rei &gt; Asuka  <br>And yet we will... forever.</br>  I think Rei is more attractive and Asuka was kind of a bitch.  Asuka was a whiny whore. Rei was at least a normal person that could carry a converstion.<br><br>Rei&gt;misato-San&gt;yui&gt;asuka</br></br>  <br> Rei <br> normal person </br></br>  Rei &gt; Asuka  <br>What, is she better?</br>  Daily reminder it is completely illogical to hate one character just because you like the other. Both are qts and both have massive issues<br> but at least it's not racemixing if I fuck asuka </br>  <br> Asuka's eyes aren't even blue <br>Why did the quality of these shorts plummet so hard ?</br></br>  I like them both equally.  Misato &gt; Asuka &gt; Rei<br><br>Rei is not even human, asuka is a bitch but shes young and she might change</br></br>  <br>Misato is a slut.</br>  <br> &gt;implying all anime characters arent white anyway </br>  <br>We will never get a christmas cake Asuka.</br>  <br>She is at least half-nip maybe more in the reboot.</br>  <br><br>While true how about Asuka plus Rei.</br></br>  <br>"no"<br>there can only be one</br></br>  <br>Rei? More like gay.</br>  <br>She is just working off some stress</br>  <br>Honestly I am pretty butthurt that there aren't more sketches for this concept.</br>  <br>I wonder how fast Asuka would have turned over for a little be of love understanding and interest. Or if Rei had actually done more then silently judge and tolerate her.</br>  <br>How is Rei not human?</br>  <br>Jinzo aren't real people anon.<br><br> Clones got no souls. </br></br></br>  <br>EXPOSED</br>  <br><br>"The only vessel that contained a soul was Rei. She was the only one born with a soul. The Chamber of Guf was empty, you see."</br></br>  ex-asukafag here, i have now seen the light that is rei<br><br>ama</br></br>  <br>But the Eva's need souls to work right its why the dummy plugs needed the blank reis to function. No soul syncro no AT field.</br>  <br>Congratulations on getting off the meme bandwagon.</br>  <br>Did you notice Rei had bigger tits?<br>Or do you prefer your waifu mostly self actualized and still somehow dead inside.</br></br>  <br>If your still on 4chan your still on the meme bandwagon.</br>   Kaworu &gt; Shit &gt;&gt;&gt; Asuak &gt; Rei &gt; Misato &gt; Mary   <br> Rating an actual non-character higher than real characters </br>  <br>Kaworu is perfection.</br>  <br>That's exactly why he isn't a character.</br>  <br> But his suffering seemed trite, and he never seemed contradicted about what he should do other then kinda sorta in a monolog and that was mostly about finding the wrong thing in the pit. Misoto and Asuka stired the beast bellow my belly.  Maybe if Kaworu pleaded for his life or something before he let Shinji kill him or was shown to be depresed or angry even once.  </br>  <br><br>Kaworu is shit.</br></br>  <br>You're not a character</br>  <br>His character is to be perfect.</br>  <br>So deep. Sasuga Anno.</br>  <br>Mogo Karl was kinda fun, busting into women's bathrooms and killing kittens.</br>  <br>Karl was based.</br>  <br>The point is that he's perfect in every way.<br>Begging is something human,which he never claimed to be.</br></br>  <br>I was hoping he'd show some emotion other then joy and confusion in 3.33 or at least have some sociopathic gap moe but he was flat.<br><br><br>And that was why he couldn't do anything for me. Hell it would have been nice if Shinji snapped at him a little for being too good and representing the person he couldn't be.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I was glad he had more then one fight even if he truly replaced Asuka as the jobbing pilot.</br>  <br>He flipped the fuck out in 3.33, shaking and everything.<br><br> Shinji snapped at him a little for being too good <br>But it's because he was too good that Shinji melted like butter everytime he saw him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shinji wants to be (like) him.<br>Shinji wants to be with him.<br>Because unlike Shinji,Kaworu is perfect and he was the first person to demonstrate love towards him.<br><br>3.33 was really stupid.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He flipped the fuck out in 3.33, shaking and everything. <br>That was confusion not anger or really even frustration and even if it wasn't he cycled really quickly back to calm. But if that moment happened in the middle of the gay piano, my dick would have responded.</br></br>  <br> 3.33 was really stupid. <br>Lets put a bomb collar on Shinji never explain anything and be surprised when it all goes tits up.</br></br>  <br>Break the smug bishounen is hot and everything, but it doesn't really make sense for Kaworu to act like that considering he's an alien and all.<br>But yeah, a suffering and crying Kaworu would be great, I want to see him lose his shit.</br></br>    <br>At least for me Asuka was more relatable, but I'm saying this as a ex-psychiatric patient.<br><br>I went through similar things as she did in the near end of the series. Which is why I'll say that Asuka is a far more complex and interesting character then blank slate doll.</br></br></br>  <br> an alien and all. <br>Are you sure? I thought he was an angel stuffed into the likeness of a person and human feelings of angst and did go through the good old five stages of grief and other text book psych shit. Hell they didn't even make a point out of How what he was doing was weird.<br><br>3.33 was a lump of sad shit that did nothing right.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rei isn't a person, but Gendo's figment doll of his wife.<br><br>Asuka and Misato were people with much more real issues then Rei.<br><br>Rei is a abnormal alien that doesn't really understand straight emotions.<br><br>Only till she gets rescued by Gendo she started to emit real emotions, but they're really obsessive.<br> <br>Just like Asuka to Kaiji, but less words and more action.<br><br>Asuka and Rei are good characters, but shouldn't be compared because that makes no fucking sense. IT BECOMES A WAIFU WAR and that ain't cool measuring people.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Asuka is the blank slate doll, not Rei.<br><br>Rei has her own thoughts and ideas, Asuka is just living out what NERV made her to be, a pilot.</br></br></br>  Could Kaworu fix Rei and Asuka if he wasn't exclusively fixated on Shinji?  <br>I would have settled for him to go full rape mode with the same cheerful smile in an Eva fight,  especially if it was against Asuka and the humans  just for the glorious fallout it would cause Shinji.</br>  <br>I don't think so.<br>Also,Kaworu broke Shinji.</br></br>  <br> Rei <br> conversation <br><br>At most she'd listen to you a little before dismissing you possibly with a slap and one-liner. She saved all of her pretentious monologs for herself. And maybe Gendo.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Asuka and Rei are good characters, but shouldn't be compared because that makes no fucking sense. IT BECOMES A WAIFU WAR and that ain't cool measuring people. <br><br>You say that, but them's fighting words. Rei is every bit as much of a person as anyone else in the anime, and saying otherwise is actually pretty insulting to the character<br><br>If you want to talk about dolls in Evangelion, try shooting for Asuka. She's the one with the doll cuewords and categorizations in the past, and in the present she can't be construed to be anything more than NERV's doll.<br><br>Gendo obviously made Rei in an attempt to resurrect his wife, but it failed and Rei was born instead. Rei predates Gendo's and mankinds existence in Lilith too, and Rei is technically as alien as everyone else int he show. She's not normal, but who in this anime is?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>By dying.</br>  <br>Kaworu could fix Asuka pretty good before he needs to be killed by the plot, because that guy was an ace at wading through people's shit to give them encouragement. Unless he would actually leave when asked.</br>  <br>Why form a bond with someone if you know nothing good will come out of it?<br>What Kaworu did was cruel.</br></br>  <br><br>Kaworu can't fix anything. Not even once has he ever fixed something, he's only made things worse.<br><br>Rebuild demonstrates he could be given virtually endless amounts of time, virtual immortality and endless tries + 14 years and still manage to be the dumbest sucker on the entire planet.<br><br>It's absolutely astounding how such a shit character in both performance and writing can at all remain popular. It's a testament to the poor judgment of many anime fans, and proof that fetish material is more important than a meaningful character.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That whole Rei as Lilith thing could have been developed a lot better.<br><br>Also Rei did manage to internalize the doll thing because her big moment as a person was to define her self as "not a doll"  I can't remember if there was a you in front of that. </br></br></br>  <br>Kaworu could fix Asuka easily, but would break her the hardest out of anyone with his death. She'd probably refuse to kill him is anything.<br>For Rei, I'm not sure. I think she needed to solve her issues herself rather than rely on someone to solve them for her. But Kaworu did help her realize her identity as Lilith, at least.</br></br>  <br>Being fixed or broken are transient states, when he encountered Shinji in NGE he pulled him out of his funk and let him have hope in humanity and a small measure of faith in himself. Now when he had to do his angel thing and leave Shinji to his own devices of course he fell apart hard. But in the brief time they had together Shinji was better and debatable Karl was better for it as well.<br><br>Now Rebuild on the other hand is shit in all things and should be discarded unless its a rebuild thread.</br></br></br>  <br>Kaworu doesn't get battle fights because he's overpowered as fuck.<br>That's why they need to come up with some plot-related reason for him not to fight like in 3.33.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7LW<wbr>nYnLJzaY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>True story. mOOT said so.</br>  <br><br> moot left 4chinz 20 years ago </br></br>  <br>The problem here is that the series lacks any evidence that Rei at all thought of herself as a doll or couldn't figure out she wasn't.<br><br>The whole "Rei is a doll" thing is quite literally something akin to a meme. Rei is quiet, subservient and mostly passive, which has the superficial quality of being reminiscent of a doll. But it's not describing the actual person, and one is here judging the dog by it's tail or the cat by it's whiskers. <br><br>If you watch the series, Rei's issues are more about understanding her differences from normal humans rather than saying she's not a doll. Rei knows that perfectly well and has no qualms saying so, or doing things her way if necessary.<br><br><br>"Rei as Lilith" is a concept that wasn't necessary to develop more in the original series, and doing so would probably detract from the overall themes and messages. It's a concept that deserves exploration however, but it's not likely to happen because it would empower Rei and all the current management is concerned with is weakening Rei.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rei isn't Lilith in Rebuild.</br>  <br> Being fixed or broken are transient states, <br>When it comes to a person, this state needs to have a sense of permanency and safety to it, which isn't in the case for Shinji or anyone else.<br><br>Kaworu didn't pull Shinji out of his funk because Shinji's "funk" isn't repairable by just saying you love him once or twice. <br>Kaworu betrays Shinji and the rest of humanity in the anime and cannot be construed as a "good person" or a good character.<br><br>The brief time they had together only made things worse. It's like straightening out a piece of paper to be able to cut it better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rebuild is fucking stupid.<br>I'm still mad that Kaworu became retarded for the plot.It was a poor way to initiate the climax of the movie.</br></br>  <br> Kaworu doesn't get battle fights because he's overpowered as fuck. <br>What a waste having him win one fight while Shinji jobbed to an angel would have made there final conflict so much better.<br><br>But having Shinji see Kaworu wreck Asuka like that would be how you say, erotic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wasn't really discussing Rebuild, and all I said was that the concept he (or you) mentioned did deserve some exploration. Which it never gets for the reasons mentioned.</br>  <br>This in a way.<br>All Shinji needs is love,apreciation  and a good punch in the face so he can snap back to reality. </br></br>  Daily reminder that every NGE girl is wonderful and all the Rebuild girls are pure shit  <br>Unfortunately I can't argue with that.</br>  <br>These sick shades are the only good things to come out of rebuild.</br>  <br>Kaworu was always retarded. Kaworu isn't retarded in Rebuild because of "plot", it's the plot that's retarded because of Kaworu.<br><br>Because no matter how much some idiots try to twist it, 3.0 and focusing on Kaworu is a retarded move after a movie like 2.0. 2.0 had established characters, story lines and character interaction that above all felt real, something that's crucial if you're going to prove some point later on<br><br>The only way to force Kaworu x Shinji into the story when the movie more or less ends with Rei and Shinji in each other's arms, is from a narrative standpoint to destroy everything associated with that to create 3.0. Because having the characters in 2.0 fall apart naturally like in NGE would require time and effort, and they don't want that since it wouldn't be effective.<br><br>The plot needs to be opaque, dramatic and above all destructive, or else it would surely fail.<br><br>Basically if you're a Kaworu fan, you're the reason 3.0 is allowed to exist. Their low standards combined with an appetite for destruction and shallow pseudo-romance makes it possible to generate a sizeable fanbase that shut their brains off permanently when Kaworu is discussed.<br><br>Which is why 3.0 was received with thunderous applause from those types of fans despite how it destroyed everything Rebuild had except Kawoshin, and the only other bright sides for other fans is some character pandering.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>NGE Keel did them better.</br>  Asukafags need to die. Their only argument is hurr durr Rei isn't a person.<br><br>Truth be told, you would have an easier time fixing Rei than you would fixing Asuka.<br><br>Rei's got her outclassed in every other category. If that cuck moot never posted about Asuka these threads wouldn't exist.</br></br></br></br>  <br>His normal shades were good enough.</br>  <br> with Rei and Shinji in each other's arms <br>2.0 was originally going to end in Rei's death, but Enokido suggested she be saved last minute.<br>She was going to die regardless, this is what they set up in Rebuild since the beginning.</br></br></br>  <br>This sort of argument isn't new. It's not moots fault exactly. It has existed as long as Evangelion has due to otaku rivalry, and even if it's wrong it's just one of the things people say because they lack arguments.</br>  <br> 2.0 was originally going to end in Rei's death, but Enokido suggested she be saved last minute. <br> She was going to die regardless, this is what they set up in Rebuild since the beginning. <br><br>See, this is why you're an asshole. You pull off drafts as some sort of evidence when there's several versions in which she doesn't die. Then the drafts didn't happen, what happened in the movie did. Stop trying justify something you know in your heart is wrong. The staff working on Rebuild made that scene with the intention of saving Rei, and the status after it was written was that Tsurumaki among others were certain she was saved or didn't die. <br><br>Rei was never going to "die", but you'd like her to die because it gets her out of the way so you it's all right for you. This proves what I'm saying right, there's no proper way to develop into Kawoshin and therefore everything had to be destroyed. Because this isn't about Rei as much as it is the entire world and the rest of the characters, everything takes a huge hit to make it possible. Rei only gets most of the attention because it's such a drastic downturn and ruination of a character, but there's a lot more going wrong here as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaworu isn't retarded in NGE.That scene with the fucking lances were stupid.The plot requires Kaworu to die and Shinji to fuck up,so they make Mr."perfect" go retarded over the lances.It's shit writing.But that's one of the many problems with that movie.<br>3.33 was always going to be the Kaworu movie anyway but they fucked everything up by trying to do this.<br><br>I like Kaworu because of all the damaged he caused.His "betrayel" was beaultifull.I like what he represents and what he makes Shinji feel.<br>I could care less about Kawoshin and muh gay anime,this series should be above this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And then there is this faggot. <br><br>I don't watch eva for fixable people, I don't give a shit about that their suffering and flaws are more important then some hypothetical future fix.<br><br>I don't like Rei as much as Asuka because she is less fun to watch less dynamic, less ironic, and less interesting even with her clusterfuck background of being a clone god thing,<br><br>I like watching Asuka sure its like a trainwreak but its amazing to see how all of her bits and pieces work together to produce an almost functional person and how close she was to resolving and when she finally did it was incredibly satisfying.<br><br>Rei was too self actualized and depressed for me to care that much about after episode five. I can understand why Anno forgot about her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> r-rei is boring!!!1 <br><br>back to reddit</br></br></br>  <br>I like how relatable all the characters are.<br><br>One day you relate to Shinji,the next one you relate to Rei and so on.</br></br></br>  <br>A different approach would be needed, and for once Kaworu couldn't be the only person Shinji could rely on just having him be there to gay piano after a near impact that didn't but almost fucked the world would still have been pretty good.</br>  <br> Kaworu isn't retarded in NGE <br>He is. He gets explained where Adam is and still makes the mistake. He dies for literally no reason whatsoever.<br><br>As for Rebuild, the "plot" doesn't require anything as the plot is malleable and entirely ignored in favor of briefly enabling character pandering. It's shit writing because the characters it panders are shit, as well is it's message and story. It can't support itself.<br><br> 3.33 was always going to be the Kaworu movie anyway but they fucked everything up by trying to do this. <br>No, it was not going to be, and the very idea of having a Kaworu movie is nauseating because it's not the fucking point of serious Evangelion story to have something like that.<br><br> this series should be above this. <br>it isn't</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> several versions in which she doesn't die <br>Where are these versions you speak of? According to the CRC, the original plan was for Rei II to die like she did in EoE, but Enokido suggesting otherwise last minute so the 2.0 ending could be more positive. That's why the rescue scene looks so forced and out of place.<br><br>She was still going to die later on, because that's how it happens in NGE.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Its true though what would you have done with her past episode five that's not part of her end game or fanservice?<br><br> Although I would have liked to have seen her try to open up to people who weren't Ikari or Shinji </br></br></br>  <br>This.<br>Part of the reason I don't like Rei is because she never tries to interact with anyone outside of Gendo and Shinji. It makes her seem shallow.</br></br>  <br> He is. He gets explained where Adam is and still makes the mistake. He dies for literally no reason whatsoever. <br>He sees that Adam is Lilith and recognizes that if he goes on he fucks humanity so he stops and has Shinji kill him so he can't do his mysterious bad thing that was somehow different from that other thing he totally meant to do, that we also don't quite know what it was.</br></br>  <br>To put it briefly, it couldn't have happened.<br><br><br>There are several draft versions you can read about, some storyboards too.<br><br> According to the CRC, the original plan was for Rei II to die like she did in EoE, but Enokido suggesting otherwise last minute so the 2.0 ending could be more positive. That's why the rescue scene looks so forced and out of place. <br><br>You're biased and wrong. Enokido doesn't provide a suggestion in the last minute, he's invited with meditated purpose, and the rescue scene is neither forced or out of place.<br><br> She was still going to die later on, because that's how it happens in NGE. <br>This is a bullshit argument because of two things:<br>We have already diverged from the series since 1.0, and 2.0 does it even more. Therefore, the continuation is under no obligation to follow the original as it has already broken that obligation.<br>The second is that the scene as proposed necessitates Rei being actually saved, and the belief among the staff was that she survived. This is also what is shown in the movie.<br><br>You're also missing the point: drafts don't happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He sees that Adam is Lilith and recognizes that if he goes on he fucks humanity <br>No, he knows that before seeing it's Lilith. Before going down there he know what he will do means the end for humanity.<br><br>He makes Shinji kill him for nothing, no reason at all. There's literally no reason both couldn't have walked out of there. None whatsoever.<br><br>Kaworu is retarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>exactly that, get her to open up<br><br>asuka on the other hand has deep psychological issues that require extensive counseling</br></br></br>  <br> To put it briefly, it couldn't have happened. <br>Why not? Sure my scenario relies on the time skip not happening and Shinji pseudo cheating on Rei but it seems viable enough to last a few scenes.</br></br>  <br>She interacts with Asuka and Toji.<br><br><br>That's pretty easy. Your spoiler pretty much lays it out, and there's always room for Rei to reflect more on what NERV is doing and whether or not she should be doing it herself.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He comes to the realization its Lilith when he sees her.<br>He died so humanity could live.He's an angel,he's too dangerous to be allowed to live.He has to die,now why he made Shinji kill him instead of Misato or Gendou,i don't know,probably because he likes Shinji.<br><br>They been hinting Kaworu since movie 1,it was obvious Kaworu was going to play a big part on movie 3.I agree that the message and story are shit,especially the story because the ending is pre-determined:Kaworu has to die and Shinji has to be miserable,then all the characters start doing ilogical things so we can get to the destination.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As a reifag, this daily reminder saddens me. Not because what you say is true, but because there are so few of us left. Where have you gone my brothers? Stand strong, together, for your waifu's sake.</br>  <br>That's why it won't be viable. It's sort of pseudo-cheating even if they aren't romantically involved, you can't do it seriously and therefore you have to drop all pretense of seriousness and go with obscure and dramatic. Rather than pseudo-cheating, Shinji is happy and not desperate enough to associate with Kaworu. <br>The plot shift of characters would also be glaringly obvious, why aren't the rest getting developed properly like in NGE? It's why the characters must be sabotaged and wingclipped in terms of depth so there's no longer any point in hoping they eventually attain any such depth.<br><br>They can't be better than the "main dish".</br></br></br></br>  <br> There are several draft versions you can read about, some storyboards too. <br>There's nothing in the CRC. If you don't show me, then I'll have to assume you're lying.<br>I did see some storyboards of her death, however.<br><br> Well, the storyline where Unit-01 devours the angel was no longer present at the earliest stage of the plot. For the new movies, from the earliest stage of planning there was a conception where “Unit-01 will reach its operational limit, cease moving, and nearly become absorbed by the tenth angel; in order to save Shinji, Rei will forcibly unite Unit-00 with the angel and self-destruct.” The script was written according to that conception up until the fifth draft. That changed from the seventh draft on to a conception where the angel devoured Unit-00. It seemed more natural that, rather than deliberately fusing with the angel, Rei would be devoured by the angel and absorbed against her will. I didn’t arrive at that idea until a great deal of time had passed. I lamented my lack of talent [afterwards], wondering why I hadn’t thought of it before then. <br><br> Because “Rebuild of Evangelion” is basically a reconstruction of the TV series, we presume that sooner or later Rei II will die. If Shinji-kun were to save Rei II it would mean a significant departure from the TV series. However, I believed that the last scene of the film had to be an earth-shattering climax. When I had this idea, it was impossible for me not to communicate it. I remember, on the third day [of the sessions], performing a solo play in front of everyone using hand gestures and body movements entitled “this is how it ends!” <br><br> and the rescue scene is neither forced or out of place. <br>It is. Only 20 minutes before Shinji completely abandons Rei and gives not a single shit about her, not even enough to say goodbye before running away. And then suddenly he wants to save her, even more than the world? It's forced, but of course you'll defend it because it panders to you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Human body, human brain. He didn't have a typically human mentality, but it was something not shared with any other angel that he personally learned and developed while in really warped human care.</br>  <br>Hardly any point in paying attention to Evangelion any more when the people making it obviously hates Rei and everyone who likes the character. It's why all artists have reverted to drawing the original Rei and shuns the "newest insult" AKA Q, and all you ever hear about Rei on twitter or japanese rei blogs concerns the original Rei.<br><br>It'll take too much to undo the poor relationship with fan and creator, and that's the way they want it apparently.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you understand her character at all?</br>  <br>Do they really need to be directly romantically involved? I mean this is Eva people die before they become entwined, unless your Kaji then you just die after.</br>    <br> We have already diverged from the series <br>There are different contexts and different events, but more or less the barebones of what Shinji and everyone goes through stay the same. <br>Hence why Anno says Eva is a story about repetition.<br>It's still following the course of Eva even with 3.0, and that's why Rei II must always die.<br>Even if she didn't in 2.0 thanks to a certain staff member's demands, she was going to die later on. Complaining about this is pointless. <br>Furthermore, I'm not sure how any of this relates to the Kawoshin thing; because Shinji shows no romantic interest in Rei just like in the Manga and the Anime. She could be present and Kaworu and Shinji would still bond regardless, just like in NGE.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Still it was kinda a dick move to shut out everyone who didn't rip her out of her metaphorical shell</br>  <br>My fellow patrician, do not forget EVA 3.0+1.0. This is Rei Q's time to shine. We shall soon see, that she is best girl, as it was long ago, as it is now and shall be again.</br>  <br> Anno says Eva is a story about repetition. <br>This is why the Rebuilds are shit.<br>Everything is forced for the sake of repetition.</br></br></br>  <br>You're intentionally evading the point. There are several drafts, and they all have something in common: they did not happen. There is no "originally" because there's multiple versions of the story that all contradict each other.<br><br>The only one that's real, is the story on screen. You're electing to use draft work as an argument while also ignoring any comments concerning them rather than accepting the reality.<br><br> t is. Only 20 minutes before Shinji completely abandons Rei and gives not a single shit about her, not even enough to say goodbye before running away. And then suddenly he wants to save her, even more than the world? It's forced, but of course you'll defend it because it panders to you. <br><br>It's not forced in any way. There's nothing more in-character for Shinji, and not to mention for a normal person in a similar situation. I can thusly prove it's not forced, which makes you the asshole for being rude enough to blatantly lie.<br><br>Shinji is extremely hurt at the time and wants to get away, his mind is completely set and that's what he's decided to do, leave it all behind. He's hurt and is doing this insistently to demonstrate how hurt he is. He says things like "i won't smile again!", which is exactly something a 14-year old like Shinji would do, try to get pity from others since he's making it clear that THEY are the ones who hurt him.<br><br>But when he sees that people he cares about gets hurt, then he can't play the insistent child any more. There's one shot in 2.0 that makes it clear, showing blood on Shinji's hand juxtaposed with the background. <br><br>Some times, for normal people, only when you see the consequences are you able to sober up and be motivated to action.<br><br>You only say it's forced because you mistakenly think the scene is a threat to your ship. Which is sad because saving another person that deserves it should be allowed without people getting angry about it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw Shinji fucks the movie up by saving Rei in 2.0 <br> mfw Rei doesnt do shit on 4.0 <br> mfw Rei will still lose because muh repetition. </br></br></br>  <br><br>Nice bait.</br></br>  <br> There are different contexts and different events, but more or less the barebones of what Shinji and everyone goes through stay the same.  <br>Nope. It has completely changed for several characters who are now the polar opposite of what they used to be, this includes characters like Rei, Asuka, as well as Kaworu.<br><br>You can't bring pretentious non-points like bringing up repetition, something that defeats your own argument since it wasn't part of the original either.<br><br> Even if she didn't in 2.0 thanks to a certain staff member's demands, she was going to die later on. Complaining about this is pointless.  <br>As 3.0, 2.0 and 1.0 demonstrates, there is nothing that is guaranteed or the same here. You are quite clearly wrong, because not only context changes, but also outcomes and the fundamental parts of characters.<br><br> Even if she didn't in 2.0 thanks to a certain staff member's demands, she was going to die later on. Complaining about this is pointless.  <br>She didn't die in 2.0 because Hideaki Anno wanted it so, only one member protested: Tsurumaki. You pushing this point is pointless. There is no argument you can make here that justifies anything, because as it's shown you've clearly misrepresented the situation, probably intentionally.<br><br> Furthermore, I'm not sure how any of this relates to the Kawoshin thing;  <br>You mean you don't want to acknowledge it. That's different, it ties to your bias.<br><br>Kawoshin doesn't happen unless Shinji is desperate, and because there are more characters and storylines present, it isn't justifiable to at all do Kawoshin besides a small appearance. Kawoshin was inflated from a one-episode appearance to the equivalent of six-eight episodes. That's how it relates. It can't be done seriously or honestly, so it has to be done honestly, i.e by destroying everything else meaning there's no value left in continuing development.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   i really miss red vs blue    asukafags exist <br><br>moot is trolling you dumb cucks<br><br>stop embarrassing yourselves, it's pathetic<br><br>asuka is a shit girl</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Rei Q <br>You're not a patrician, and you're not my bro. You can shine the turd that is Rei Q, but it'll just be a polished piece of shit.</br></br>  <br>So you admit those drafts and storyboards were made up then? Thanks for lying.<br>Drafts or not, they're the original plan and confirm the fact that Rei II was going to die just as she does in NGE. If not in 2.0, then in 3.0. <br><br> It's not forced in any way <br>It is, very much so.<br>For Shinji to say he'll disregard the world means he'll disregard Misato (who he has a much closer bond with), Kaji (who helps him much more than Rei ever did), Asuka (the main reason he left in the first place) Touji+Kensuke, and the other people he cares about and worked so hard to protect by piloting the Eva.<br>Disregarding them all for Rei just sounds forced and incredibly cliche. It's really not in-character in the slightest.<br>Also, thanks to Shinji saving Rei, she's been more or less forced into a weak fragile damsel in distress who can't do anything on her own.<br>Unlike the scenes of her sacrificing herself in NGE or where she does it again in the drafts, she is no longer presented powerful and capable of protecting herself. Now she's stupid and serves as nothing more than a tool to validate a man. Or be validated by a man, rather.<br><br>I'm not saying she should be saved, but to think her dying is forced or wasn't to be planned since the beginning is delusional thinking.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kawoshin doesn't happen unless Shinji is desperate. <br> Shinji <br> Not in a state of eternal desperation </br></br></br>  <br><br>Evangelion wasn't originally about repetition or any such related theme.<br><br>Repetition is something that's forced into the franchise because of Anno's intention to introduce more prominent Kawoshin, since Kaworu is the figure that exists outside said repetition.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Repetition is something that's forced into the franchise because of Anno's intention to introduce more prominent Kawoshin, since Kaworu is the figure that exists outside said repetition. <br><br>That's a stupid conspiracy theory based on merchandise aimed at fujos.</br></br></br>  <br>It's an observation. It's also the factual usage of the idea concerning repetition/looping in Evangelion so far.</br>  <br>Just because you don't want to face reality doesn't suddenly make the truth disappear:<br><br> ”Eva" is a story that repeats. <br>It is a story where the main character witnesses many horrors with his own eyes, but still tries to stand up again.<br>It is a story of will; a story of moving forward, if only just a little.<br>It is a story of fear, where someone who must face indefinite solitude fears reaching out to others, but still wants to try.<br>We hope that you look forward to the 4 new retellings of this story.<br><br> She didn't die in 2.0 because Hideaki Anno wanted it so <br>Another staff member suggested it, Enokido developed it, and Anno approved it after contemplation. It wasn't there since the beginning, rather it appeared very late in the game as a last minute thought. CRC confirms.<br><br> You mean you don't want to acknowledge it <br>More like I never even considered it. You shippers think in weird ways.<br><br> Kawoshin doesn't happen unless Shinji is desperate <br>Reishin doesn't happen unless Rei is desperate. She will allow anyone to get close to her if they're nice to her, because she's looking for someone to treat her well. She's so desperate for this that she even puts up with Gendo. Does that suddenly make her bond with Shinji shallow and invalidated? No, you dumbass. It makes it realistic. Everyone in Eva is more or less desperate, and they latch onto others for their own comfort. Just like reality.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn, Kaworu looks fine in that left panel.</br>  <br>Again evading the point. They are drafts. You using them in your arguments only proves how little of an argument you have.<br><br> It is, very much so. <br>Okay, let's see why. <br><br> For Shinji to say he'll disregard the world means he'll disregard Misato (who he has a much closer bond with), Kaji (who helps him much more than Rei ever did), Asuka (the main reason he left in the first place) Touji+Kensuke, and the other people he cares about and worked so hard to protect by piloting the Eva. <br>Explained here: <br><br> Disregarding them all for Rei just sounds forced and incredibly cliche. It's really not in-character in the slightest. <br>There's nothing saying he's disregarding them all for Rei. Shinji does not have the intention or knowledge that he is doing so. This is reconfirmed even in 3.0.<br><br> Also, thanks to Shinji saving Rei, she's been more or less forced into a weak fragile damsel in distress who can't do anything on her own. <br>Which is only true because of 3.0. Shinji, Asuka and others were more than once saved by Rei Ayanami, and they're not necessarily damsels in distress. Strong characters can also be saved, what makes one a damsel in distress is that it's the character's only function. Cutting Rei short with 3.0 makes sure that's the case. <br><br> Unlike the scenes of her sacrificing herself in NGE or where she does it again in the drafts, she is no longer presented powerful and capable of protecting herself. <br>This happens because of 3.0, as Rei's sacrifice in NGE also happened against Zeruel.<br><br> I'm not saying she should be saved, but to think her dying is forced or wasn't to be planned since the beginning is delusional thinking. <br>Rei dying is forced because we confirm from staff, as well as the actual movie that she didn't die or end in 2.0. Therefore introducing that change without any reasoning is forced.<br><br>Again you're biased as hell.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shinji's only sort of peripherally aware of the stakes up to that point. He would not be able to function at all were he actually conscious of being savior of the city and humanity, he directly states he is unable to think of himself as a protector. He even straight out says he pilots to receive praise and so he can stay in Tokyo-3, it's the comfiest his life's ever been and the most direction he's ever had. That's why I like episode 19 so goddamn much, that was framed as the traditional heroic realization and comeback before it went so fucking wrong.</br>  <br>Fuck off fujoshit.</br>  Has anyone every found anything on the Apple version of evangelion?  <br> So you admit those drafts and storyboards were made up then? Thanks for lying. <br><br> Rei dying is forced because we confirm from staff, as well as the actual movie that she didn't die or end in 2.0 <br>It's not, because she was going to die regardless. Anno confirms by stating Rebuild is a retelling.</br></br></br></br>  I'm fine with Eva interpretations in general except one:<br>- Rei is escapism because she's a stronger and better person<br>- Asuka is reality because she's weak and flawed<br><br>I can never reject Rei, escapism or not, I can't stop admiring the better person.</br></br></br></br>  Who would you rather hang out and bond with non-sexually?<br>Kaworu or Rei?</br>  <br>Nope,thats a theory.<br><br>The looping is the reason Kaworu failed to make Shinji happy again.<br>If you want to please fujoshits,you don't kill one of the gays,and you certainly don't end your movie by making Shinji hold hands with Asuka.<br><br>The pandering was shit,the fucking piano was so stupid.The bathscene in NGE is superior to 3.33.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you think they have tea parties in Shinji's heart?</br>  <br>Just because you don't want to face reality doesn't suddenly make the truth disappear:<br><br> Another staff member suggested it, Enokido developed it, and Anno approved it after contemplation. It wasn't there since the beginning, rather it appeared very late in the game as a last minute thought. CRC confirms. <br>Nothing was there since the beginning, any part of the story has gone several revisions and diverges quite heavily from NGE already in it's first revision. CRC confirms.<br><br>What this means, put shortly, is that you're evading reality by pretending drafts are more relevant than the real thing: the movie. You're also escaping the truth by ignoring what the CRC has to tell you. Instead you've tried to discredit the real, original movie as being unoriginal because another (discarded!) drafts exists. This is true for every character in Rebuild.<br><br> More like I never even considered it. You shippers think in weird ways. <br>You considered it, and you're the shipper. I only consider narrative, story development and character interaction. Hence why you're picking the most illogical and irrational approach to understanding the movie there is, one laden with bias and loathing.<br><br> Reishin doesn't happen unless Rei is desperate. <br>According to yourself, Reishin doesn't happen at all. <br><br>That said, Rei's desperation as well as Shinji's is well developed. There exists a solid foundation for Rei's relationships, not only with Gendo but also with Shinji and others, which is what makes it not shallow. Rather than a question of being shallow, the post I made referred to how one would go from point A (2.0) to point B (3.0).<br><br>Like I've very correctly explained, doing so is impossible. Which is why 3.0 didn't do it. It created a gap and made all the changes it needed (destroying everything) off screen, thus never actually developing from point A to B. This has little to do with shipping. Think plot/character.<br><br>Kaworu is not realistic, nor is their relationship. Nor is 3.0.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's mostly bullshit derived from Evageeks who like to make everything about shipping and harem wars.</br>  <br>NGE Kaworu,because he's nicer.</br>  <br>You do, because Kaworufans and fujos are given the universe to toy with, since Kaworu is looping it means they're free to imagine this happening over and over again with Kaworu at the helm, and kawoshin at the helm.</br>  <br>A retelling that has diverged on major key points, therefore not all points are the same. Rebuild is not a re-telling, because so far it's told a different story with markedly different characters.<br><br>Hence there's no logical or justifiable reason that Rei _must_ die. Most of the other characters have seen different developments and fates, why single out Rei?<br><br>You don't have the truth or reason on your side.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Campus Apocalypse already introduced this concept and fujos didn't buy it. It actually got cancelled because no one bought it.</br>  <br> Kaworu is not realistic <br>Thats the point.<br><br> nor is their relationship. <br>Not really,Shinji admires Kaworu because he thinks he's perfect and because he's desperate for love.If i were in Shinji's shoes i would have probably fallen for him too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've seen plenty of Kaworufags claim it doesn't matter because there will be another loop and repitition. Kaworufags are more happy about Shinji being desperate for Kaworu than they are with actual endings and so on.<br><br>A Kawoshin end is actually damaging because they can no longer imagine their ideal end. Making it real is ending the fantasy. Kaworu must remain shallow and malleable, or else there is no point.</br></br></br>  <br> That's mostly bullshit derived from Evageeks <br>One More Final symbolism is so in your face you would have to be retarded to miss it</br></br>  <br>Daily reminder that it is actually healthier to be in a relationship with an alien clone of your mother than with someone who is emotionally or physically abusive.</br>  <br>Fujo's bought it, and it's pretty much for them more than anyone else. The art style as well as the character/shipping focus is squarely on them, and Kaworu is the one that elevates himself in by the end concerning looping, with an ending that leaves Shinji crying over Kaworu and whatnot. Tragic romance sells better than actual romance. See Titanic for christs sake.<br><br>Campus Apocalypse completely shits on Rei for instance.</br></br></br>  <br>If you want to make up your own 'evidence' and blatantly lie about what's there in front of you whenever you get stuck in a corner, fine by me.<br>But don't expect anyone to play along with your little game.<br>You can continue being delusional here on /a/, but that won't change a darn thing about Eva and where it's going. <br>You're equivalent to a whiny little kid who bitches about the world yet is too lazy to do anything about it. You're insignificant.<br><br><br> hurr lemme ignore Anno's own words because I'm a faggot <br>Yeah, there's no getting anywhere with you. <br>Instead of entertaining your autism, I'll go watch some Anime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Thats the point. <br>Then you know your own point concerning the realism and depth of it being bullshit.<br><br> Not really,Shinji admires Kaworu because he thinks he's perfect and because he's desperate for love.If i were in Shinji's shoes i would have probably fallen for him too. <br>A relationship is a two-way road, and the single reason of "desperation" makes it poor.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One More Final is Shinji choosing Asuka because ultimately, she's the closest to him.<br><br>Rei becomes strange and Shinji cannot understand Misato.<br><br>All the shipping is stupid because as the show develops, only Asuka fits with Shinji, being flawed as fuck and unstable human beings.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Evangelion wasn't originally about repetition or any such related theme <br>It kinda was. In the sense that the FAR as parents failed their children who failed their children who failed their children who piloted Evas so their parents could further fail them.</br></br>  Daily reminder, evangelion is  shit   <br><br>What the fuck<br>But he always fucks up in every single loop.How is that good?How is that satisfying to fujos?I'm not satisfied at all.</br></br></br>  <br> Fujo's bought it <br>No they didn't, no one bought it. That's why it got cancelled so early.<br><br> Campus Apocalypse completely shits on Rei for instance. <br>It actually doesn't. Not at all.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hurr hurr lemme pretned ot have a point <br>Oh no you don't faggot.<br><br>You don't escape being schooled like that. Fuck off for being so autistic you can't admit you're wrong on an ANONYMOUS imageboard. No matter what you say, it doesn't change the facts that the retelling has diverged enough to not be considered a re-telling, and it's diverged on every major key point that relates to your argument that it should be the same because it's a "re-telling".</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shut up Kaworufag, your damage control doesn't work here.<br><br>The only ones that give a crap about it besides shitting on it are fujos, and that's for the reasons you left out. Also, it does shit on Rei you dumb idiot.</br></br></br>  <br> demotivations </br>  <br><br>You're literally retarded.<br><br> choosing Asuka <br>Shinji doesn't choose Asuka, she comes out on her own.<br><br> she's the closest to him <br>She's not, take a look at who appears when Shinji is getting tanged.<br><br> Rei becomes strange and Shinji cannot understand Misato <br>And he's frightened by Asuka as well, which she points out.<br><br> because as the show develops, only Asuka fits with Shinji <br>Abusive hitting and verbal abuse is not 'fitting', it's fucking damaging and terrible in every single way.<br>Nowhere during the show do they get together or even show romantic interest towards eachother. Same with EoE.<br>Anno has never once considered Asuka x Shinji as you'd see by his own shipping preferences.<br>Likewise, their relationship is completely nonexistent in the Manga and the Rebuild for a reason. It's not even important to Eva.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They have low standards, almost as low a their IQ.<br><br><br>If you want to make up your own 'evidence' and blatantly lie about what's there in front of you whenever you get stuck in a corner, fine by me.<br>But don't expect anyone to play along with your little game.<br><br> You can continue being delusional here on /a/, but that won't change a darn thing about Eva and where it's going.  <br> You're equivalent to a whiny little kid who bitches about the world yet is too lazy to do anything about it. You're insignificant. <br><br>So you practically admit you're wrong and I'm right, and then turn to attack me instead? I don't deny what's happened, you do, and then when you're proven wrong you get sore about it. You're the child here for lowering yourself to lying as well as defending something you obviously know is wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No<br>one <br>bought <br>it<br><br> Also, it does shit on Rei you dumb idiot. <br>How so? Elaborate instead of sperging out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shinji resorts to asking for Asuka's help when everything else fails him. He chose her as his emotional and rational support.<br><br>Asuka abuses him like heck but at the end of the days, they have similar problems and understand each other better than any other couples.<br><br>And manga and Rebuilt do not fucking matter.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Riddle me this: If Asuka, Kaworu and Misato can drastically change their characters and develop differently, and avoid much of what they did in NGE, why can't Rei?<br><br>Logic: 1<br>Kaworufag: 0</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's still a relationship.<br>Admiration,envy and need.<br><br>Kaworu by himself is boring,Shinji is what makes the whole thing good.Not enough time or need to explore Kaworu</br></br></br></br>  <br> posting <br> like <br> this <br><br>Stop it fujo.<br><br> How so? Elaborate instead of sperging out. <br>Okay, so you're going to pretend you don't know? Did you even read it yourself? How about this, please try yourself before I do, or am I totally wrong in assuming you're intelligent enough to do that?<br><br>I will give you my answer, but seriously, try to figure it out for yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Honestly, Kaworu is just an attempt to break Shinji further from both a meta viewpoint and the story viewpoint.<br><br>He gets raped, he is forced to nearly kill his friend, now he's forced to kill someone he "loves".</br></br>  <br> It's still a relationship. <br>A shallow, unrealistic and poorly developed one.<br><br>A relationship that is in the context of constructing a solid narrative, much less one that rivals the competency of the original, an inherently destructive and counterproductive one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A story can only be told so many times until it gets stale.<br><br>Kaworu is the best one for Shinji but he dies.<br>Rei is second best.<br>Misato is crazy<br>Asuka is crazy</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Shinji resorts to asking for Asuka's help when everything else fails him <br>To which Asuka scoffs at him, because she knows he's just using her. He doesn't really care. She's just a side dish to him.   And you and I both know who the main course is.  <br><br> He chose her as his emotional and rational support. <br>Because there was literally no one left, and when she refused he tried to kill her. That's how much he cares, she's just a validation doll to him.<br><br> and understand each other better than any other couples <br>Pic related. The only one in the entire show who truly understood Shinji was Kaworu.<br><br> And manga and Rebuilt do not fucking matter <br>They do to Anno. And according to Anno, your 'couple' is a fantasy within your mind that never happens.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>From a meta viewpoing, Kaworu is an attempt to make Kaworu in the Evangelion franchise become more popular.</br>  <br>Fuck your shipping. It's the cancer of everything.</br>  <br><br>Sounds to me like you're just mad that Shinji loves him instead of you're waifu.</br></br>  <br> Because there was literally no one left, and when she refused he tried to kill her. That's how much he cares, she's just a validation doll to him. <br>Not him, but tell me Kaworufag, what does this make Kaworu?</br></br>  <br>That doesn't change the symbolism of One More Final. <br><br>The real world didn't change just because Shinji had his Instrumentality revelations, the choice he made were still present. It's a complicated world that will reject you from time to time. <br><br>Asuka is "the other", a person separate from Shinji. Their relationship is that of two people, it's harsh and painful at times, but now they have to live together in the real world. <br><br>Rei is Shinji's mother, Shinji says goodbye to his mother when he ventures out into the real world. Rei stays an Instrumentality ghost separate from harsh reality. <br><br>Asuka = Reality <br><br>Rei = Escapism <br><br>I don't care about the shipping angle but the symbolism is clear as day.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No one bought it, therefore fujos didn't like it despite it being the whole looping shebangbang with Kawoshin front and center.<br>Likewise with Detective Evangelion, which also got cancelled in its first volume.<br>Fujos don't like it, so they didn't buy it.<br><br> Okay, so you're going to pretend you don't know <br>I read it, and she wasn't shit on.<br>Elaborate on your point and tell me how she was shit on, if not than you're just a delusional faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not unrealistic.<br>Relationships based on admiration and need are quite real.<br>You may dislike it,but you can't deny the impact it has on the narrative.<br>Again not enough time or need to fully develope the relationship.EVA isn't a love story,someone as good as Kaworu last long.</br></br></br></br>  <br> retard Kaworufag doesn't understand that if Shinji stays in love with Kaworu he just becomes Gendo  <br><br>You really don't understand anything about NGE</br></br></br>  <br> despite it being the whole looping shebangbang with Kawoshin front and center. <br>There you go, you admit it's there. <br><br> I read it, and she wasn't shit on. <br>I told you to try.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaworu because he is a cheerful energetic person who actually wants to do things.<br><br>I don't feel like getting my shit slapped in for trying to get Rei out of her shell or to have a life outside Eva.</br></br></br>  <br>Rebuild is the cancer.</br>  <br>The same thing it makes Asuka.<br><br>Interestingly enough,i think Misato would have given him the love he needs.Why didnt she again?</br></br></br>  <br> what does this make Kaworu? <br>The one Shinji loves. <br>Rei and Misato were there, other people were there, but he was afraid of them and desired to be alone instead. Only then does Kaworu show up.<br>Furthermore, if Kaworu was just a validation doll, then why did Shinji continue to love him even after he betrayed him and hurt him? Because he's more to him than that, he still loves him regardless of what he truly was.<br><br><br>None of that is shipping or even so much as implies Asuka x Shinji.<br>Hence why Anno has done nothing but ship Kawoshin for the past two decades.<br><br>You're 'couple' is one that never happens because the story ends right there. Beyond that is speculation and your own personal fanfiction.<br>Kawoshin is the one that actually happens in the story.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not unrealistic. <br> Relationships based on admiration and need are quite real. <br>Relationships in real life are not the ones portrayed in NGE with Kaworu. The relationship as portrayed in NGE is shallow, unrealistic and ultimately poorly developed because it lacks substance and depth.<br><br>One sentence:<br> Relationships based on admiration and need are quite real. <br>doesn't justify the portrayal of a relationship in fiction. By your logic, all relationships in ficiton are realistic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>heh.</br>  <br> Shinji stays in love with Kaworu he just becomes Gendo  <br>Shinji still IS in love with Kaworu, hence why he's in his heart as the words I love you. This doesn't change all the way to the end of the movie.<br>But despite loving him, he will not obsess over his death and he will continue living and move on.<br>He doesn't become Gendo, but his love for Kaworu is still there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rei<br><br>Kaworu is boring and Rei is interesting since she has a lot more on her mind.</br></br></br>  <br> None of that is shipping or even so much as implies Asuka x Shinji. <br>Are you mentally deficient or something? <br><br>I am talking about the Asuka being a symbol of reality and Rei being a symbol of escapism in One More Final <br><br>I specifically said I don't care about shipping. Jesus Christ get that dildo out of your ass and think with your brain for a second</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is he right or just a bitter old fuck?  <br>Maybe that's why he hates them. He wanted girls.</br>  <br>why not both?</br>  <br> How the hell are you supposed to raise a daughter <br>Americans expect women to raise their daughters, fathers are too afraid to interact with their children in america.</br></br>  <br>bitter old fuck</br>  <br>Personally, I think what is considered "art" is subjective.<br><br>That being said though, I think "trash" is a pretty apt description of most anime especially nowadays. Not because they're all bad but they're only meant to be watched once and then done away with.</br></br></br>  Just watched this. <br>It began relatively well, better than I expected, but then it turned to absolute shit in its second half. It's a shame, it almost managed not to be bad. <br><br>Why can't any Dragon Ball production be good anymore ? Everything produced in the last few years has been awful : OVAs, movies, and the new anime series. <br><br>Couldn't they just let Dragon Ball rest in peace ?</br></br></br></br></br>  Is it better or worse than Battle of the Gods?  <br>is this real life?</br>  The whole deal about the revival of Freezer was retarded as fuck. They should've just used a brand new enemy instead of reusing freezer and use a bullshit reason to explain why he went from being the weakest Z final boss to being super powerful in just 4 months  Better question, do you support the frieza force initiative?  <br>Better. Beerus and Whis are only side characters, the villains seem actualy threatening for a moment, and it has some good moments. Piccolo, Krillin, Ten-Shin-Han, Gohan and fucking Master Roshi fighting a thousand-man strong army of mooks was awesome. It has a good Goku vs Freeza moment.<br><br>Then all goes to shit when Goku turns into Super Saiyan God and Frieza turns golden. From here, it's one annoying twist after another. Also Vegeta keeps getting shit upon by the writers. <br><br><br>Yes. A laser rifle actually defeated Goku. In Super Saiyan God form, no less.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lasers always hurt DB characters.<br><br>Like King Piccolo hurting kid Goku with his laser eyes, something that regular Piccolo uses too <br><br>Then Super Perfect Cell injured Gohan with a laser attack too</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> baiting that hard <br><br>Sure everyone just forget that Krilin in cell saga damaged goku just by throwing little rock on his head because with guard down he can be killed like normal human</br></br></br></br>  <br> baiting <br>Actually, this is one of the few threads that picture is relevant. I normally use it to troll the Superman V Goku threads on /co/.</br></br>  <br>The fuck are you talking about, that is filler anime for giggle,</br>  <br>Where did you watch it? Are you talking about a screencap or did you watch it in quality? I don't know what the fuck is taking so long for a high quality release.</br>  <br> OVAs, movies, and the new anime series. <br>The 2008 special and BoG was great though you pleb<br><br>There is nothing wrong with Super either</br></br></br></br>    <br> kid goku has not reaching super saiyan and each enemy is on par to them making a damage to goku. Those thing is not even a small riffle.</br>  <br>Remember at BoG when SSJ 1 vegeta said to be surpassing Goku at SSJ 3. That shit that said to be canon make me laugh.</br>  <br>I found it on nyaatorrents.<br>Camrip, in spanish, and with subtitles from people who clearly don't speak english very well. <br>It was quite an experience in itself.</br></br></br>  <br> nothing wrong with Super either <br>Yeah, apart from the really lazy shit animation, rehashed plot, and questionable pacing.</br></br>  <br>Haven't they only released 3 episodes of it?</br>  <br>Yes. Three episodes of boring filler-level slice of life.</br>  <br>How can BoG is good because it's a huge chunk of inconsistency. watching it make someone puking because of confusement. Only 1 wish shenron, SSJ 1 vegeta said to be stronger than SSJ 3 Goku, bulma's age, Goku can breath on space, dinosour extinction, etc .</br>  <br>Yeah, the animation is shoddy as fuck, and the preview for 4 looked even worse. That's not something that's going to get better. The show so far has been a rehash of KtK, with nothing significant added, and based on the OP it looks like they'll be doing FnF, too.<br><br><br>Try not being autistic. It's a cartoon. It's meant to be fun and enjoyable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So you dislike Super because it retcons the in-universe power levels and consistency? Toriyama probably got sick of people saying Superman can defeat all his characters, hence why he made Beerus so unbelievably strong in the very first episode.</br>  <br>Try to be not an idiot and try to use your brain for once.</br>  <br> How can BoG is good because it's a huge chunk of inconsistency. <br> watching it make someone puking because of confusement <br>and I'm the one not using my brain?</br></br></br>  <br>No, he destroy the setting that he created. he makes it non canon as possible. He even forget the ruling how shenron granting wishes and a lot other. This is more like a doujinshi than dragonball comic.</br>  <br>Yes because you are an idiot for not noticing the contradictions.</br>  <br>Tell me how vegeta at SSJ 1 said to be surpassing Goku at SSJ 3? Let alone a lot more to say about other consistency.</br>  <br>I take it Spanish is your first language?<br><br><br> power levels <br>It doesn't fucking matter.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I take it sign language is your first language?</br>  <br>Beerus and Whis are one the best additions to the BD universe in a decade, the freshest take on a "villain", their interaction are the most fun to watch and they are the most fleshed out and promising side characters in general.<br><br><br>BoG is a much more enjoyable and just a plain better movie. Maybe because it's so different from your usual DBZ movie. It has better structure, script, direction and is plain more enjoyable to watch as a character treat. RoF is just an amalgamation of basically any other DBZ movie except for the fact that it's a bit longer. <br><br><br>Power levels are a relative thing, dumbass. If a fighter is stronger at the base level their transformations will be stronger too. SSJ Goku during Buu saga would be much stronger than SSJ Goku fighting Frieza. The Vegeta you're talking about is yet another case though, in DB in a fit of rage anyone can be temporarily much stronger than they ought to be.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Power levels are a relative thing, dumbass.

Super saiyan is more of controlling emotion than letting his rage went wild. The effect should have given negative effect than good effect. Do you even know about dragonball?</br></br></br>  <br>OK but has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?</br>  <br>Your rage gives me life, the more power levels are going to get shat on in Super the more I'm going to enjoy it. The more the unassuming characters defeat Goku, the more joy it'll bring me. It's about time we put retarded discussions about who is allowed to kick whose ass because of some bullshit number assigned to their strength aside.<br>Really the only thing I ask of Super is keeping Whis and Beerus the strongest from start to finish, that's all I'm asking of Toriyama. There needs to be some kind of roofing over this powering up thing before it becomes redundant beyond repair.</br></br>  <br>Wat?</br>  <br>Learn english on a communicative level before you come to an english speaking board and try to argue abstract ideas you aren't even able to phrase.</br>  <br> Then all goes to shit when Goku turns into Super Saiyan God and Frieza turns golden. From here, it's one annoying twist after another. Also Vegeta keeps getting shit upon by the writers. <br>Well, this movie was actually completely scripted by Toriyama, and he never liked Vegeta. BoGs had the story heavily modified by Toriyama, but the script writer was someone else, who is even a self proclaimed Vegeta fan, which is why he gets that scene where he does better against Beerus than anyone else besides SSJGod Goku.</br></br>  <br> Your rage gives me life <br>Only 1 wish shenron, SSJ 1 vegeta said to be stronger than SSJ 3 Goku, bulma's age, Goku can breath on space, dinosour extinction, And the story about Shenron fucked up a wish All of this shit is impossible to happen.<br><br>This shit is doujinshi at very best.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That because you're not even understand DBZ. Less newfag like you the better.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, that scene was anime only. It makes sense though since they clearly establish here that their resistance and strength is entirely due to ki, and call out Goku specifically as relaxing too much at times and dropping his defenses.<br><br>It never happened before in the manga to that level, but it doesn't really contradict anything.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shenron simply fucked off because he was afraid of Beerus, he filled one wish and he's allowed to leave if nobody makes another wish for some period of time (according to Toriyama) here's your answer. Did you NOT get it from the context of the scene? How can you bitch about inconsistencies when you aren't even able to read the fusking moment?</br>  <br>It contradict that goku is immune of bullet. he even confused when someone shot him, he felt nothing and confuse about the bullet and the gun.</br>  <br> It contradict that goku is immune of bullet. <br>That wasn't a bullet from a standard earth gun though, it was a laser from the substitute leader of Freeza's army. I don't see how being strong enough to take a bullet means laser immunity.</br></br>  <br>Shenron cannot be dismissed before granting the wish in ANY WAY OF POSSIBLE. THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN DISMISS OF SHENRON IF YOU SAID YOU HAVE WISHED ENOUGH AND THANKED HIM AND ORDER SHENRON TO DISMISS. THIS IS OBVIOUS AS FUCK.</br>  <br>When did Shenron do more than one wish? I honestly dropped the manga during the Piccolo arc.</br>  <br>Continuity in Dragonball was never that big. Get the fuck over it. Some human on earth made androids stronger than Freeza. This shit never made sense.</br>  <br>remember that goku that immune of bullet is at first volume or kid goku but not goku at SSJ above level not even a God level.</br>  <br>When Dende upgrades it at the end of the Cell Saga, it becomes able to grant two wishes. They even bring up the 2nd wish in RoF.<br><br>I think the official explanation for the 2nd wish in BoG's is that Pillaf for some reason only made a single wish when gathering the Dragonballs for the first time, which is why they returned less than one year later in the first place.</br></br></br>  <br> headcanon <br>nope, if nobody says their wish shenron will leave, he asked if anybody has another wish and nobody said yes, thus he left. It's a Toriyama made rule, also, this was a comedic moment for shenron, he was scared of Beerus. It's comedy, you know, it's funny.</br></br>  <br>No read your shit AND STOP READING DRAGONBALL HEROES OR DRAGONBALL DOUJINSHI RELATED! THAT SHIT IS NON CANON!</br>  <br> Yeah, the animation is shoddy as fuck, and the preview for 4 looked even worse. That's not something that's going to get better.  <br>Dragon Ball has never been a paragon of animation and its Toei.<br><br>It has been consistent though. This may not be Toei at their top but it's not them at their worst either.<br><br> The show so far has been a rehash of KtK, with nothing significant added, and based on the OP it looks like they'll be doing FnF, too. <br>First of all, nobody calls the show Kami to Kami unless you're Japanese. It was even called Battle of Gods over there. Second of all, we know the story will retell the movies but they are going to go into new material. <br><br>http://www.kanzenshuu.com/2015/07/0<wbr>1/dragon-ball-super-complete-showca<wbr>se-event-reveals-series-plot/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How are you actually getting this mad right now over Dragon Ball?</br>  <br><br>But this movie establishes that most of the extra power and resistance he has gained would be purely ki based. That was always a possibility considering everything in the manga, this movie just confirmed it. His skin isn't magically getting stronger. He just gets more ki which he uses to raise his defense, yet during that moment he let his guard down and so got pierced through.<br><br>Obviously the scale is different, but look at his battle with Piccolo. Piccolo releases a large energy blast with all of his power that fails to do any damage to Goku who's bracing for it, and, yet, afterwards, when Piccolo is heavily beat down, he pierces Goku with a single blast just because he wasn't paying attention. It's clear that it wasn't just a matter of Goku's skin being though enough to take the 1st blast, otherwise the 2nd would have been completely useless.<br><br>Also, Goku wasn't "immune" to bullets in the beginning. It didn't pierce his skin but still hurt.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Toriyama had never taken the setting of DB as radical as you or others make it out to be. To say he's destroying his setting is just you getting unnecessarily angry.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128809523 <br>Se he spked THAT HE SAID 'ALREADY ENOUGH' AND INDIRECTLY TOLD HIM TO DISMISS. He cannot leave without order. Shenron is not an idiot. There is reason he never fucked up a wish even just fucking ONCE.</br>  <br>Lel you delete your own post because it proves my point.</br>  <br>Why not? The newfaggotry is sometime trigger me.<br><br><br>No, He doesn't felt hurt he even not said something about being hurt eventhough he is shotted at less than 5 M range. Goku is thrown by a rock under SSJ 1 eventhough it's not strong throw but felt a pain.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He clearly felt the bullet and yelled in pain. It just failed to pierce his skin.</br></br>  <br><br>Why can't you niggers accept that 80% of dragonball is just for fun.<br>The remaining 20% is filler.</br></br></br>  <br>just laugh at the angry sperg</br>  <br>I laugh at your stupidity for deleting your own post because it support my claim.</br>  <br>There is a scene where he got shotted by Red ribbon and he felt nothing but i forget where i get it. Prolly latter.</br>  <br> 8 days for my most likely viewing <br>Fuck. I have to find someone who will go with me. <br><br>Debating whether to tell them to watch BoG first. On one hand, the fun shit will turn them off. RoF seems a little more like the pleb tier DBZ they would enjoy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean this? It's a sniper, rather than a handgun, but he seems to take the hit in a similar way.</br>  <br>I agree, it's not so much 'felt nothing' but 'working through the pain'.<br><br>DBZ characters are so OP I didn't even think about gun in universe...</br></br></br>  <br>Not this one, it's not a sniper gun. Probably latter i will search it again.</br>  <br> boring filler-level slice of life. <br>NO. Get out, GET THE FUCK OUT. It's been seventeen years since DB last aired on television with a new series. SEVENTEEN. And after all these years mere three episodes of characters doing their character stuff which allows people to catch up, get familiar again bore you? Fuck off! Go play a DB video game or something if all you care about is pew pew pew.</br></br>  Are we getting Resurrection of C?  Whis and his bullshit time rewind power ruined the movie. Earth blowing up could have been a lesson for Goku to stop being a pansy and finishing his fights, but nooooo.<br><br>Also, Vegeta turning into a Super Saiyan God was bullshit. He didn't deserve the power-up</br></br>  <br>Fuck you, if anything it was Vegeta who deserved the kill, not Goku. It's hilarious, how they turn back the time to kill Frieza before he sneak-destroys Earth, and actually take MORE time to deliver the blow than Vegeta would have, had he been allowed to continue. Vegeta fought seriously, with no boasting and bullshitting, and he deserved that kill.<br><br> He didn't deserve the power-up <br>Why? For being the hardest-training Sayan he doesn't deserve a transformation? Yeah fuck you.</br></br></br></br>   movie is garbage compared to BoG <br> still going to watch it anyways <br> still going to buy it when it comes out on DVD <br> tfw I'm going to continue this cycle forever <br>Dragon Ball is my crack-cocaine and hardly anything will keep me from wanting more.<br>I even started watching Super, and that dropped the slice-of-life stuff real quickly to rehash BoG and RoF.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why? <br>Because he's a manlet</br></br>  <br> That's all I'm asking of Toriyama <br>Sadly, there's still the possibility that Toei fucks up introducing new characters not present in Toriyama's original plot.<br>Hell, they could even bring back  Broly  if they wanted to.</br></br></br>  DBZ in general is just as bad as Naruto  everyone here is such a faggot Battle of Gods is a 10/10 movie  <br>And?</br>  <br>Does Naruto takes itself seriously? If yes, then DBZ is better, if no then they're on the same level.</br>  <br>It would have been better with Cell as the bad guy tbh.</br>  <br>Cell isn't nearly as iconic, he also wasn't as much of an asshole as Frieza so his punishment wouldn't feel as rewarding.</br>  <br> On one hand, the fun shit will turn them off. RoF seems a little more like the pleb tier DBZ they would enjoy. <br>FnF is full of fun scenes. It's not a serious movie at all</br></br>  <br><br>Fucking fool.</br></br>  <br>Are you implying that the fact that we know its a rehash, but will stop being so eventually makes DBS as it exists now any less lazy? <br><br>And really this is pretty close to Toei's worst in animation terms. A significant segment of the second episode was a fucking slideshow.<br><br>I never said I disliked Super, but to say there's nothing wrong is really stupid.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes. thats exactly what is implied. they are adding some much extra stuff to this 're-has' it might as well be its own story</br>  <br>They really haven't added anything terribly significant up to this point.<br><br>There's nothing wrong with enjoying DBS. I've been enjoying it myself, but I'm not going to pretend like it isn't super lazy on Toei's part.</br></br></br>  <br>cooler is not canon</br>  God dammit Toriyama.  <br> Piccolo, Krillin, Ten-Shin-Han, Gohan and fucking Master Roshi fighting a thousand-man strong army <br>Was Yamcha really not there ?<br><br>Is Yamcha really weaker than fucking Roshi now ?</br></br></br></br>  <br>This, Krillin was also able to almost kill Vegeta with one blow because Vegeta let himself get hit. Chi probably works the same way as nen in that regard</br>  Another week with no ED album. What Mappou-like injustice!<br><br>Will we finally get a Back In Black episode? Who knows, the hints are as vague as ever.</br></br>  The stream is over, the episode is At The Treasonersvill. I suppose they want to finish Amnesia's arc quickly, so they're following it in the chronological order for now.

Is it an adaptation of another medium? Where does it air? Why are the episodes half-lenght, in 4:3 aspect ratio and with animation similar to South Park? Thanks.  <br>yes</br>  <br> Is it an adaptation of another medium?  <br>Of a light novel that parodies the american representation of Japanese pop culture. There's also a manga adaptation.<br><br> Where does it air? <br>Niconico, other streaming sites<br><br> Why are the episodes half-lenght, in 4:3 aspect ratio and with animation similar to South Park? <br>Because the director felt it fits the tone of the original work and because Trigger is experimenting and trolling us in the process since we did keep asking them for Inferno Cop 2. Look for the interview, it should clear some things up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I see, thanks for the valuable insight.<br><br><br>I did feel like there had to be straight-up trolling involved.

Why did Nasu sell out?</br></br></br>   Tsukihime has better story, characters and setting <br><br>[citation needed]</br></br>  Fate has edgy self insert protagonists and girls who appeal to the more people  <br>[1] - the vn</br>  Fate is the worst eroge of all time with the worst heroines of all time  <br> self insert protagonists <br>If you're able to self-insert as Shirou, I'd go to a psychiatrist if I were you.</br></br>  you don't need to make another shitty thread  You can also rape the maids in Tsukihime C:  <br>Not for much longer.</br>   sell out <br>He's not the one who chose which would get more popular<br><br>I know you Tsukihime-only fags are bitter over it, but you'll get your remake soon and maybe just maybe ufo will keep sucking Nasu's chode for easy money, guaranteeing a Tsukihime anime. be patient and stop whining</br></br></br>  <br>edgy protagonist</br>  Because your opinion is wrong  <br> edgy protagonist <br> implying Shiki isn't 10x edgier than Shirou </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Fuck off fatefags, don't ruin this thread as well</br></br></br></br>  <br>http://www.lurkmore.com/w/images/9/<wbr>9e/Thischair.jpg</wbr></br>  <br> fatefags <br>I like all the Type-Moon stories, stop it with your immature us vs them mentality</br></br>  Fate has better waifus.  I thought Tsukihime was the better story, but I had more fun reading Fate.<br><br>Fate's more popular as it's more shonen-y I guess. A lot more emphasis on fights and that.<br>The reason I actually picked up fate was because I was craving something very shonen at the time, because I'm an absolute faggot or something.<br><br>Would very much like to see more Tsukihime stuff though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fate has more wish-fulfillment and people like to imagine themselves summoning cool servants from the past and duking it out.</br>    I want to help Kohaku heal and be happy.  <br> implying </br>  <br>Fuck you Ciel that's not the picture I clicked</br>  <br>Nasu simple became a better writer.</br>  <br> Fate <br> writing </br></br>  <br>What if Ciel was a meido?</br>  <br> EOP talking about writing quality  <br>That's not how it works.</br></br>  <br>Sounds exactly like two tsundere teenagers bickering.</br>  <br>Tsukihime's terrible repetition &gt; Fate's terrible metaphors</br>  <br>Also Arc has bigger boobs than anyone in Fate. That makes the show better</br>  <br>I promise you that you don't know as much japanese as I do. That scene in particular is way off the mark.</br>  <br>I invented Japanese and I can assure you that scene is the pinnacle of literature.</br>  <br>Pretty sure that's from the scene at the temple where Archer saves Shirou from Caster. So yeah.</br>    <br>mite b cool</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>time to go fatefags</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Liking bags of fat <br><br>Disgusting</br></br></br>  <br>Make me, turbonerd :^)</br>  I want to have violent sex with Akiha.  <br>Go fap to Prisma Illya you goddam pedophile</br>  Tsukihime is dead and you fuckers need to stop holding onto its corpse.  Why can't we all just get along?<br><br> Except the Aokofags and the Toukofags. They must always remain at odds. </br></br>  <br>Fate is easier to get into because it's a simpler concept.</br>  <br> Tsukihime gets an entire remake <br> Fate gets a shitty mobile game </br></br>  <br>Tsukihime and Fate are the same shit, but you insist on making these threads pretending that one is better than the other, and that they aren't the same shit.</br>  <br> Fate gets tons of expanded material <br> Tsukihime gets a supposed remake that is coming never </br></br>  <br>Why won't you let me be your friend?</br>  <br>Fate got re-released like 3 times already, also how's that Tsukihime anime?</br>  <br>That's why it's getting a remake, right?</br>  <br>And an anime<br>And a movie<br>And multiple manga<br>And several consecutive light novels</br></br></br></br>  <br>Remake &gt; shitty spinoffs.</br>  <br>All the expanded material is shit. Nasu is milking it for all it's worth before releasing the Tsukihime remake. After he completes that he will retire on a high note with Carnival Phantasm 2.</br>  <br>I think they are both pretty terrible but funposting is fun.</br>   Japanese Twilight vs Chuuni Fightfest #78 <br><br>Why don't both of you read an actual book.</br></br>  Fate anime adaptions are better, Fate VN is newer and shinier.  <br>Fate was just more polished than tsukihime and was an official commercial release as type moon.<br>It piggy backed off the sucess of tsukihime enough to draw a new crowd that complete disregarded the first work after waves of new content.</br></br>  <br> Fate VN is newer and shinier. <br>By that logic Mahoyo is the best of Nasu's VNs.</br></br>  fate - battle chunni for psuedoNEETs/otaku-lite/wannabees<br><br>tsukihime - super self-insert pandering for full blown NEETs/otaku</br></br>  <br>Because I really like Takeuchi's art. Is that so strange?</br>  is this a trick to get people to think fatefag EOPrimaries are tolerable and not as cancerous as tsukihimefags, or are they actually this bad?  Fate setting is more interesting and is somehow more deep than Tsukihime<br><br>Whereas Tsukihime has a better setting, ambience and girl</br></br>  Have any of you read any good books lately?  <br>Mahoyo lacks shine. No VAs, no choices, shorter. It has better art, but it's a step back in terms of a lot of things.</br>  <br> tsukihime - super self-insert <br><br>obviously, the entire far side is to see what it's like for shiki to go slowly insane<br><br>i can't believe mongoloid fatefags still use this as a criticism</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>TMfags are masters of mental gymnastics.</br>  <br>I'm not a lolicon, but I love White Len. Why is it that makes White Len special? It's like she has an air of maturity around her while still being cute.</br>  <br> Tsukihimefags  <br> Cancerous <br><br>The most cancerous parts of the TM fanbase are actually the faggots who make Fate threads to shitpost about how much they hate it.  Followed closely by Jetsfag. </br></br></br></br>  <br> sure shirou gets a harem but he's not a self insert because 'blah blah blah something bad happens also he's not totally sane' </br>  <br>They're just pissy because Shirou is one of the most famously dull MCs in Japanese media.</br>  Issei &gt; that shitty ginger in Tsukihime<br><br>This is the only element that Fate does better</br></br>  <br>you mean /a/<br><br>it's easy to get them confused because fate hypeshit took over the board</br></br></br>  <br>Shirou doesn't get a harem though.</br>  <br>Yeah just started reading the Danmachi LNs</br>  <br>multiple girls in multiple simutaniously-canon timelines, fuckaccess on just about every female character of note.</br>    <br>He doesn't get a harem though. He gets one girl in each storyline.</br>  <br> talking shit on Arihiko <br>Fight me, fag.</br></br>  nasu is the biggest hack of the last 25 years<br><br>he makes George R. R. Martin look like Isaac Asimov<br><br> Yes I went there motherfuckers </br></br></br></br>  <br>UBW Good and HF True exists in case you forgot.</br>  This "rivalry" is even more retarded than FSN vs F/Z. You're like children. I'm fairly certain that some of you have to be, in fact, actual children.<br>Why don't we talk about things we like? I like Ciel.</br>    <br> What is UBW good end? </br>  <br> it's all canon but not!! <br>fatefags in charge of multiverse theory</br></br>  <br>Nobody likes Ciel.</br>  <br>I guess more or less every harem VN ever isn't actually a harem VN, because routes.</br>  <br>He doesn't do anything to Saber in UBW Good. You have to make assumptions that there will be threeways.</br>  <br>I've read Asimov but not R. R. Martin, so I don't care anyway.</br>  <br> I like Ciel <br>back to reddit</br></br>  <br>I like Len!</br>  <br> Shirou doesn't have plot armor because muh bad ends </br>  <br> fate hypeshit took over the board <br>How newer can you get?</br></br>  <br>he's bad, but he's closer to asimov than nasu</br>  <br>There is literally nothing wrong with George R. R. Martin</br>  <br>I like Arc</br>  <br> he didn't have sex with them on screen so it's not a harem <br><br>Well shit I guess every single harem anime/manga isn't a harem then.</br></br></br>  <br>I really like his new design, though I am disappointed he doesn't have his earrings anymore.</br>  <br>Her best point is get ass.</br>  https://strawpoll.me/5077909  <br>I want Ciel to beat me up.</br>  <br><br>A harem is having multiple women after you. Shirou only gets one woman in each route, and routes aren't really defined by what girl you pick.</br></br>  <br>personally I like the parts where Nasu has the hero kill people in a really cool way, it's awesome</br>  <br>There is literally no romance between Saber and Shirou in UBW Good. Seriously, go through it again. Shirou's only in a relationship with Rin.</br>  <br>I bet Shiki does nothing to Arc in Ciel's good ending either</br>    <br>Ciel Good actually has Arc making out with Shiki on screen. There's literally no romance between Shirou and Saber in UBW.<br><br>Shit, even Nasu's gone on record defining their relationship in the route as being that of a mother and son.</br></br></br>  <br> Shirou only gets one woman in each route <br><br> UBW Good <br> Saber, Rin <br><br> HF True <br> Sakura, Rider, Rin (toss up) <br><br> routes aren't really defined by what girl you pick <br>Could've fooled me considering Fatefags treat each route like Saber/Rin/Sakura's beauty pageant</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tsukihime winning by quite a bit.</br>  <br> UBW Good <br><br>He's with Rin, Saber's just around.<br><br> HF True <br><br>He's with Sakura, Rider's just around.<br><br> Could've fooled me considering Fatefags treat each route like Saber/Rin/Sakura's beauty pageant <br><br>You've played the VN, right? Routes are locked until you beat them in the right order, and transitioning between routes is mostly based on stuff like choosing whether or not to let Saber attack Archer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If the genders were reversed for this scene everybody would be calling it wrong and disturbing. Why is this allowed?   Double Standards <br><br>Who is best girl and why is it Saotome</br></br>  I wouldn't call it wrong or disturbing.  <br>Can we not go there?</br>  <br> If the genders were reversed for this scene everybody would be calling it wrong and disturbing. <br>No, everyone would be calling it shoujo shit and people would be complaining about the popularity of rapists as shoujo love interests and how all women are sluts for liking this sort of thing.</br></br>  Everyone I've spoken to does not question how this was a straight up sexual assault, if not rape. It's a good illustration of the importance of sex ed and how people need to be taught about the definition of consent.  <br>It would be hot either way with great faps to be had.</br>  <br>Would they though? If MC was a girl, she'd still have been shown to idolize and want to be with Manna. Although would Anna's constant dripping be changed to constant jizzing?</br>  That depends. How hot would FeMC be?  <br> Although would Anna's constant dripping be changed to constant jizzing <br>Precum</br></br>  I need a miku in my life<br>and I need one bad</br>  What do you call a girl like this?  <br>Moon Princess or an alien.</br>  <br>Perfection.</br>  <br>Moon Presence.</br>  <br>Breathtaking.<br><br> Hit image limit right before I replied <br>Damn.</br></br></br></br>  Have any of you read or watched Mayo Chiki?

But is female NTR good?  <br> We all know male NTR is bad <br>For who? the vainllafags?<br><br><br> But is female NTR good? <br>It's excellent, I need more of this.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   NTR <br> Good </br>  <br> muh vanillafags <br>Oh fuck off already will you? I don't want to be lumped in with you drama-loving faggots just because I enjoy non-pussy sex.</br></br>  I only like NTR where a yandere imoouto or childhood friend mindbreaks a guy who already has a girlfriend.  <br> NTR <br> good <br>Sasuga tripfag</br></br></br>   the four best characters in all of digimon <br>discuss.</br>  Ill get around to finishing and printing it someday  <br><br><br>I recently rewatched both 01 and 02 after having watched them on TV when I was younger.
