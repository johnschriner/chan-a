Plus there's probably a few other haremfags in that list somewhere too.</br>  anything is fine  Have they never heard of the Nuremberg Code in Japan? I see human experimentation come up as a topic in so many anime, that I can just assume all anime writers are ignorant college drop outs who just lever learned that this kind of thing is very illegal.  <br>He can use his ability to refract electromagnetic waves. Maybe even reflect.</br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio<wbr>_wave#Speed.2C_wavelength_and_frequ<wbr>ency<br> Radio waves travel at the speed of light.[3][4] When passing through an object, they are slowed according to that object's permeability and permittivity. </br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>1. Don't let influential people find out. Who gives a fuck if yet another conspiracy theorist on twitter spouts batshit insane stuff about magical people being captured and experimented on?<br>2. Proceed to not give a fuck if UN finds out because the setting is Japan. Japanese people? Won't do or say anything because standing out is bad. US? Oh sure they would trade sanction their largest customer contractually obliged to buy all their worthless 3rd grade 50 year old military hardware.<br>If anything, they'd be asking for the test results to be shared.</br></br></br>  <br>magnetic and electromagnetic wave always travel on the air at the speed of light.<br><br>except if you're on a vacuum space, you need to create a (very small)electromagnetic field to do that.</br></br></br>  Reminder to not watch shit subs and wait for a decent fansub release <br><br>http://pastebin.com/h11nt5ri</br></br>   that feel when no minotaur gf to help with my gains by supplying me an endless amount of whey through her breast milk   <br><br>wait, they were cucking human males?<br><br>all this time i thought they were cucking pretty boy centaurs.</br></br></br></br>  Threadly reminder to imagine what paizuri from Cathyl would be like.  <br> Rachnee has no flaws, what're you going to attack? <br>They will invent something, don't worry.</br></br>  <br>They made a huge point out of Cerea's mother  fucking her teaser and conceiving Cerea by doing so. </br>  <br>Because she's NTR shit, and yet another pointless girl added to the main house?</br>  Has animu ever made you cry?  <br>I always tear up a little bit when watching Gunbuster, Diebuster and Gurren Lagann.</br>  <br>Nice rec thread, now fuck off and watch boku no pico</br>  Have I cried? No. However I just finished Angel Beats and I am consumed by this encompassing emptiness I cannot define. I didn't even particularly like the show, however I cannot stop this frustrating emptiness and it's preventing me from functioning properly.<br><br>I can't play games I get tired after 15 minutes the happiness is tiring.<br><br>I can't watch other anime for the same reason.<br><br>I can't go to sleep as the opening theme has become this haunting tune which drags my thoughts back to this anime.<br><br>It was just supposed to be a fun day watching anime with friends why is it so hard to function now.<br><br>Please help me I cannot sleep.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Shigatsu wa kimi no uso make me cry like at the end :'(  <br>This is a disgusting mixture of newfaggotry and shit taste</br>  Can we expect any character development or are we just gonna see them between MC's interactions with the three fantasy girls?  <br> How can they fuck up an adaptation this bad? <br>Lots of practice and giving it their all.</br></br>  <br> Gintama <br> One Punch Man <br> Young Black Jack <br><br> obscure <br> teen <br><br>- Gintama is a multi-million copy selling shounen manga serialized in the best selling magazine in all of Japan. <br>- OPM is the biggest hit web comic in history of the medium, and recently hit the milemark of five million copies, cementing itself as one of the most successful new seinen manga in Japan.<br>- Do I need to even explain Black Jack? The name is so huge, not a single Japanese citizen is ignorant of the name.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But most of the Order are mostly unnamed and died</br>  <br>Yeah but who cares about cunts with no name or character development. They're just numbers, like the soldiers that died in this episode. With boobs.</br>  <br><br><br>Oh but they do, the only reason that they look old to you it's because you are probably kids.<br><br>And you mentioned the popular ones not the other half.</br></br></br></br></br>  post all reasons as to why saki saki is best grill  <br>I did word that poorly. What I mean to say is that what makes a sue (with the negative connotation) is the fact that their exceptionally positive treatment by the story is not seen as being 'earned' by the viewer. In a more general sense, their positives are not beneficial to the writing.<br><br>Iroha may have a pretty positive portrayal compared to the club members at this point in the story, however she had to develop to get there. That disqualifies her as a sue as her positive qualities are not excessive and detrimental to the story, and because the story isn't over she may have more negatives appear by the end.</br></br></br>  <br>They wank when they don't get replies too.</br>   Irohafags and Yukinofags throwing shits at each other <br> Meanwhile we Yuifags just appreciating our goddess <br><br>Feels good to be part of the fan base of the best girl.</br></br></br>  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br>Nice falseflag there.</br>  Rei or Asuka?  <br>Can Rei even feel sexual pleasure?</br>  <br>Huh. This character design isn't half bad. I could imagine a socially adept first child with flair, but no real identity, and a mentally unstable third child, but that has no social skills. 10/10 would rewatch with Reisuka and Asurei</br>  <br>that tentacle angel sure got her flustered</br>  <br>She's socially retarded not physically broken.<br>If you rub the right places, her plugsuit would get wet and slimy.</br></br>  <br>Probably but we should ask Anno.</br>  DATO?!  Reminder that Ogawa-san is the MC.  The pace of these songs are a lot slower than the ones in G.  <br>I'm a moron and forgot that lyrics sheets are included in these things. I'll try and translate it. If I'm successful I'll post them here.</br>  <br>Oh, not jealous but moe.<br>悠木碧「翼さんとマリアすごいラブラブじゃないですかー。熱いですね！」<br>奈々さん「碧ちゃんそういうのも好きなんだー！」<br>悠木碧「はい！なんで周りからクロスアンジュ勧めてもらったんで見てみます<wbr>！」<br>奈々さん「待って」<br> #水樹奈々<br><br>奈々さんの話からすると、翼さんとマリアさんは今後さらにラブラブするらし<wbr>い。<br>悠木碧さんが萌えるほどだそうですw<br>#LIVE_ADVENTURE <br>#symphogear<br><br><br> mfw Aoi is a shipping fag </br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes of course, Aoi is a fujoshi. Didn't you know?</br>  Hey. Dumping an untranslated collection of oneshots, from 1991.<br><br>https://www.mangaupdates.com/series<wbr>.html?id=31282</wbr></br></br>            Is she retarded?  <br>stop talking, retard</br>  <br>Overall personality probably, while the shape + color occasionally change for a moment to match current mood (yellow - happy).</br>  <br>Who are you calling retard, retard?</br>  <br>Even though she says her catchline all the time, you can see with the thought bubble that she isn't actually gloomy. Actually more neutral to somewhat happy.</br>  Does anyone know what the thought bubble colors represent?<br><br>Also Gel-chan a cute.</br></br>  I don't quite understand the logic of this girl's outfit.  <br>The minister wasn't elected.</br>  <br>There is a reason she wears the floweer. Just look at how many petals it has.</br>  <br>So if he needs to be appointed by the monarch then surely the monarch has the legal authority to dismiss him too.</br>  <br>The flower motiff on her is actually pretty important if you think about it after reading the novels, it's a pretty big hint really.</br>  <br>He was appointed by the crown princess.</br>  Episode 2 just aired.<br><br>Vegeta is still tsun.<br><br>Beerus remembers what Super Saiyan God is.<br><br>Gregory is now canon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It all come down to one thing that maturity level of Japanese kids is equals any 16-17 year old outside japan</br>  <br>all I can say is that scene fucked with me, and would have fucked with me even more if I was a kid</br>  <br><br>This takes place before both of the new movies, so yeah you're fine. It seems like they are going to adapt the movies.</br></br>  Can we go back to talking about tanoshii vacation and tsundere Vegeta now?  <br>portuguese dub was the best thing ever<br>since they moved their mouths for way too long, the voice actors were allowed to include whatever they wanted to to fill the gap</br></br></blockquote>]
