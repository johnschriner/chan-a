[ So guys, who's the strongest NasuVerse character?  <br>ORT or one of the other TYPEs</br>  Well actually lets exclude the TYPE's nad leave it to beings on earth otherwise the TYPE's would be the winner.  I'm working on Heavens Feel and I'm at the point where Kotomine is surgerizing her, but I have a question: Why does Sakura feel guilt towards Shirou? I mean she's the one that got raped, does she blame herself for being impure and wanting him, or what? Or am I thinking in the wrong context and she feels guilty because she kept her being a master from him?  <br>It's the latter of what you're thinking, the master thing</br>  Takeuchi's libido.  Slash Emperor, Zelretch back in his prime  Type Mercury (ORT) = Ado Edem &gt; Type Jupiter &gt; Type Saturn &gt; Type Moon (Crimson Moon) &gt; Type Pluto = The Six Sisters &gt; Type Venus &gt; Arcueid (Full power) &gt; Balor &gt; Primordial Demons &gt; True Demons &gt; Primate Murder &gt; Original Roa &gt; Angra Mainyu &gt; Zelretch (young) &gt; Lancelot (F-15) &gt; Gilgamesh (Vimana) &gt; Counter Guardian Archer &gt; Gilgamesh (Tohsaka) &gt; Gilgamesh (Kotomine) = Arcueid (30%) &gt; Dark Sakura &gt; Dark Saber &gt; Lancelot = Saber &gt; 5th Berserker &gt; Dark Berserker &gt; 17th Roa (Elesia) &gt; 4th Rider &gt; Merem Solomon &gt; 5th Lancer (optimal) &gt; 4th Lancer = 5th Rider (Sakura/optimal) = 4th Caster (optimal) &gt; 5th Lancer (Kotomine) = 5th Caster = 4th Caster (Ryuunosuke) &gt; 5th Rider (Shinji) &gt; Nrvnqsr = Clairvoyant Fujino = Kurogiri &gt; Archer &gt; Kouma &gt; 5th Assassin = 4th Assassin &gt; Aoko = Barthomeloi = Arcueid (6%) = Kojirou = Ciel = "Ryougi Shiki" = Soren Araya (within the Ogawa Building) &gt; Gun God (Black Barrel) &gt; Touko = El-Melloi = Night of Wallachia &gt; Sion Tatari = Melty Blood Satsuki = R. Shiki = Akiha = Asagami Fujino = 18th Roa &lt; Tohno SHIKI = Alba = Heaven's Feel Shirou = Kiri &gt; Nanaya Shiki = Reinforced Kuzuki = Sion = UBW Shirou = Waver = Bazett &gt; Avenger = Rin = Kotomine = Zouken = Luvia &gt; Kiritsuhu = Irisviel &gt; Maiya = Leysritt = Tsukihime Satsuki = Lio = Avalon Shirou = Sakura = Ilya = Kariya = Len &gt; Kirie = Caren = Meruka &gt; Azaka &gt; The Dead = Possessed Corpse = Misayo = Dragon Tooth Warrior = Fuji-nee &gt; Gun God (unequipped) &gt; Fake Shiki &gt; Ryuunosuke &gt; Tomoe &gt; Keita San &gt; Shinji = Hisui = Kohaku  <br>Gilgamesh <br>inb4 Shirou beats him <br>That was BS</br></br></br>  I'm the night.  <br>how was that BS? Shirou is the most likely to beat Gilgamesh than every other servant or human, his ability is almost the exact same as Gilgamesh's along with gilgamesh arrogance on using Ea at the last scene, he ended getting overwhelmed and destroyed because of his arrogance.</br>  <br>i thought Angra Mainyu was weak</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>I'm gonna go with Type-Sol or maybe Type-UY Scuti</br>  <br>From Nasu its Arcuied then Ryougi followed by servant tier characters like aoko, dark sakura. Servants werent in his list but theyd be ranked amongst the servant tier characters.</br>  <br>The fanbase's collective autism.</br>  <br>Not the fake one, not Avenger, the real Angra Mainyu</br>  <br>Gotcha, ty.<br><br><br> Tohno and Nanaya Shiki's on the bottom half of the list. <br>Against non-humans, doesn't he jump up a shit load?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gilgamesh (Kotomine) = Arcueid (30%)<br>I'm sorry, what? Also Kouma would stomp EMIYA</br></br>  <br>ORT-chan is the strongest and the cutest.</br>    <br>My ass</br>  <br> Can't understand all the backstory and plot placed into Type-Moon works. </br>  <br><br>That single &lt; between Roa and SHIKI kills the linear progression. Is HF Shirou stronger than ORT or not?</br></br>  <br><br>Please not this again.<br><br>Yes Gilgamesh is stronger, yes it was bullshit he got beat, but thats where arrogance and a badass reality marble gets you.</br></br></br></br>  Any chance on a Fate X Jojo Doujinshi out there?  <br> JoJo </br>    <br>If you're implying that Gilgamesh even comes close to Arc then you best realize you're wrong now.</br>  <br>It all depends on who lands their trump first. Plus Arc has the whole You+1 deal.</br>  <br>Can someone tell me which is Arcueid 30% and 6%.<br>The full power is Archtype Earth right ?<br>Which one who got slashed by Shiki ?</br></br></br>  If Lancelot was paired with illya, they would be unbeatable. Prove me wrong.  <br>30% was Arc(normal) when she's using 70% of her power to suppress her blood-lust, 6% is after Shiki cuts her into little chunks iirc.</br>  The White Princess. She is the Ultimate One.  <br>I thought the 30% was post Shiki-gibbing?</br>  It's ORT until a stronger TYPE shows up.  <br><br> None of the Necos <br><br>What a shit ranking.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seriously?<br>ORT.<br>Conditionally? <br>Tohno fucking Shiki</br></br></br></br>  <br> Type Pluto <br> implying Pluto is a planet </br></br>  <br>THIS<br><br>Lancelot ftw</br></br></br>  <br>After losing 1 arm Giglamesh should have gone all out on him instead he decides to keep acting like a fucking rtarded</br>  <br>She was already using 70% of her power before the events of Tsukihime as the growing strength of her bloodlust just increased as time passed since she was created close to 1000 years ago. Shiki cutting her up decreased that remaining 30 to around 7 percent after having to stitch herself up again. Then as her arc proceeds, she loses even more energy trying to stop Shiki from getting killed by Roa Shiki.</br>  If there is a Type Moon, does that mean there is a Type for every moon of Jupiter and Saturn?    wouldn't Void Shiki be potentially stronger than Types?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Her face just says "Fuck with me. Just fucking try."</br>  <br>Probably.<br><br><br>Not even Void can kill a Type, even with her MEoDP.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No. Her eyes have a distinct limitation that will prevent her from killing Types. Age.</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>Emiya can't trace EA</br>  <br>No, Types do not have a concept of death unless they are in the RM of their home planet.</br>  Fate is a clusterfuck of inconsistency because Nasu is an uncaring hack. Enjoy arguing "objectively" over something that objectively has no objectivity.  <br>Probably. Some moons of those are very large after all.</br>  <br><br><br>I thought Void Shiki offering to restore Mikiya's eye was implying she was akind to a god in her connection to the Root</br></br></br>  <br> Primordial Demons <br>Nasu was talking about Cthulu shit when he said that right?</br></br>  <br> falling for cheap bait </br>  <br>I am.</br>  <br>Gods aren't exactly the strongest beings in the Nasuverse.</br>  <br>and that is why I'm still not sure how the Root works exactly</br>  <br>Isn't there a difference between Arcueid 100% (Red Arcueid) and Archetype Earth?</br>  <br>But the Root is not a god.</br>  <br>The root is an automatic system, not god.</br>  <br>I know that, but I thought Void Shiki could control it to some degree or some shit</br>  Shiki  <br>Rewrite or change root archives for existences to a certain degree probably, but she's just an end user not an admin which means that she has limitations on what she can and cannot do.</br>  <br>Even if she could, she's limited by the body of Shiki. Shiki is an inferior container and cannot use Void correctly.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=WCj<wbr>P1BFK4vI</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>After taking the opponent into outer space, she compresses space time in the palm of her hand, then makes them implode. I would like to see a character top that.</br></br>  <br> they had to Nerf Archetype Earth's Last Arc since it essentially oneshots </br>  <br>Stupidest pasta i ever read</br>  Last Stardust is so damn good.  <br>Shirou is the strongest when fighting for Sakura</br>  <br>The whole album is pretty solid.</br>  <br>Neko Chaos and Neko Arc.</br>  Can't Arc benchpress a moon or some shit?  <br>HF Shirou hardly does anything despite being strong. He kills Berserker, and then gets his ass kicked by Kirei. Kind of a waste.<br><br>UBW Shirou does a lot more fighting.</br></br></br>  <br>Tohno can in fact kill servants.<br><br>When he killed Arcueid, 17 cuts landed in "an instant".<br>This is on the same level as 5th grail war Asassin's Tsubame Gaeshi. This is in fact canon. Not only that, but Arcueid was not able to notice she was being followed, nor feel any killing intent from Tohno until the blade already killed her. This is on the same level as assassin servant presence concealment.<br><br>In the official Tsukihime manga, Shiki was capable of slicing and killing lightning shot at him by Roa. A low estimate of the speed required for this would land at 96,000MPH, which is the atmospheric discharge of lightning at denser levels (closer to lower altitudes.)<br><br>Tying together presence concealment, Zelretch level ability (flash sheath), and A class speed, Shiki could in fact stand a chance against most servants. His trump card that would place him above anything summoned under assassin card would be that he essentially has an instant kill move if he ever gets near, making him a very deadly opponent.<br><br>To use concrete evidence of Shiki proving himself time and time again, we can look at who in fact he has killed.<br><br>Nrvnqsr Chaos the 10th apostle. In one attack Tohno managed to kill all 666 of his lives.<br><br>Michael Roa Valdamjong, said to be immortal by traveling between Akasha and back, "reincarnating". Tohno severed his connection to Akasha, erasing his existence.<br><br>It's good to take note here, that Servants are tied to the Akashic record in the throne of heroes, which is what allows them to be summoned in the first place. When Shiki kills a servant, they can no longer be summoned. Sounds like just the kind of person Archer was looking for.<br><br>In the "Talk" side story for Tsukihime, Tohno manged to kill the forest of Einnashe, the seventh dead apostle. He also managed to kill Einnashe's reality marble.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> After taking the opponent into outer space, she compresses space time in the palm of her hand, then makes them implode. I would like to see a character top that. <br>You forget how hax Marble Phantasm is.</br></br>  Y'all think you soooo bad.<br><br>Why y'all think you so bad, huh?</br></br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  Tohno Shiki or Void Ryogi Shiki. I don't care what the fuck Nasu said, the moment the dots are connected, the enemies are killed.<br><br>Their only problem is the lack of attack range, and any faggot with a gun would easily gun them down.</br></br>  <br> this is what Shikifags actually believe </br>  <br>Neko Arc a shit. Riesbyfe literally punched her into the stratosphere.</br>  <br>I think Archetype is cheating.</br>  <br>Except Types have no concept of death.</br>  <br>Of course they do.</br>  <br>Nasu is.</br>  <br>ORT</br>  <br> It is about ten meters. I need two steps to get into knife range. To ensure a kill, I need to take three steps. </br>  <br>So how did Gun God kill them?</br>  Him  Why was Fate Shirou able to kill Kotomine, but HF Shirou, a much stronger Shirou, got his ass kicked?  <br>Level 10 reality warper. Ain't gotta explain shit.<br><br>Jus' do what they do.<br><br>The Neko cast works for NINE HOURS A DAY serving CUSTOMERS. Yeah. That's right. Heartless, godless, unknown-to-death abominations.<br><br>Even Saber Alter at her prime could not manage that for a SINGLE DAY. They do it for at least thirteen or more if you count the OVA.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because HF Shirou got his ass kicked by HF Shirou.</br>  <br>probably one of the types.</br>  <br>Black Barrel is a specialized weapon for killing Types.  Ciel had it just in case Arc went full power. </br>  <br><br>This is a side effect of becoming swords.</br></br>  <br>is there any guy sexier than him in the Nasuverse?</br>  <br>If they can be killed then they have concept of death.<br><br>Shiki just has to focus.</br></br></br>  <br> Lancelot (F-15) &gt; Gilgamesh <br>Whut?</br></br>  <br>OLD</br>  Why is there no Nasu protag with [gun] as his root?

He doesn't jump to servant tier stats or anything, he's not super monster fighting that's a hundred times peak human.<br><br>He's basically just at peak human in terms of ability, as Nasu puts it "Shiki is the two of hearts in card terms, he's not very strong on his own, but he can be strong by piling up trump cards and acting as an assassin". If it was a head on battle almost anyone in his own game would surely kill him, but if he's playing smart he'll find a way to strike first even when outgunned.<br><br>In terms of raw numbers Nero, Roa, Arc, Sacchin, or basically anyone in Tsuki shit all over Shiki.<br><br>Yet Shiki has skill and specialization in a certain way that he's good at dealing with inhumans even if they are far above him in power and everything.<br><br>Its hard for people to get the difference between an Assassin and fighter in terms of style. Assassins are typically outgunned by the things they fight, but through some knowledge or skill they can kill those things even when far overpowered.<br><br>Even a top class Nanaya isn't shit to a demon in power or speed at all, but they have special training that allows them to turn the tides briefly to aim for a kill.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shiki literally killed the spirit of a parcel of land.<br><br>The proof of concept is there.</br></br></br>  I thought Shiki was able to kill anything  <br>i'd probably say red archer<br>hes strong as fuck in the show<br>white archer is also strong but red archer has more xp i believe<br>im talking about shirou archer btw</br></br></br></br>  [x] Touch nine fluffy tails  <br>Nasu said he doesn't.<br><br>But I don't believe his fucking words.</br></br></br>  <br>Just because you have no concept of death doesn't mean you can't be killed. Shiki can't see lines no matter how much they try to.<br>Look at the Crimson Moon, he got put out by Zelretch when he had no concept of death.</br></br>  <br> as Nasu puts it <br>Stopped reading right there. Use facts to argue instead of a writers shitty and meaningless opinion.</br></br>  <br>Only things with a some concept of death.</br>  <br> Killing a spirit <br> Anywhere near on the same scale as killing the embodiment of an entire planet </br></br>  <br>I remember reading that Shiki would have trouble seeing the lines of powerful entities, i.e. he wouldn't be able to see the lines of night time Arc but he could see her lines in the day time.<br>Shiki can train his eyes and start to see more lines (such as walls and shit) but it would damage his brain.</br></br>  Is a servant's power scaled with their fame or how old they are?<br>If the former is the case, then wouldn't Heracles be stronger than Gilgamesh? Since Herc's myth is generally more well-known than Gil's.</br>  <br>If it bleeds, you can kill it.</br>  <br>Nasu likes to wank Gil. Don't expect shit to make any sense.</br>  <br>Tohnofags are at the top in terms of being the worst at understanding that he's fundamentally weak, or not as strong as they think at all.<br><br>  "At this point, "MELTY BLOOD" caused a major contradiction. <br>Since this was a fighting game, the position of the protagonist, Tohno Shiki, a character that could participate in combat only by means of trump cards, was reversed, and he became involved in the story as a protagonist that can "fight normally".<br><br> "....Right. The characteristics of the characters in "MELTY BLOOD" had either been exaggerated or restrained from what they had been in Tsukihime." <br><br> "Using cards as an example, Shiki of Tsukihime would be a 3 of Hearts. But the Shiki of "MELTY BLOOD" would be able to fight normally as a Jack of Spades." <br><br>They go "Well Shiki can probably kill Shirou, and Shirou is as strong as the strongest servant, so Shiki is stronger than the strongest servant and is as strong as hundreds of humans together"<br><br>Its an entire point that Shirou was never servant tier, even at his peak he says directly he cannot hope to match any servant but Gilgamesh, and he can only match that one due to heavy compatibility match up. Even the anime lays that out for people, that no he cannot match servants. He only had a chance due to the way their abilities matched out. Shirou would lose to probably even Avenger if it came down to it outside of compatibility. <br><br>After hearing that Tohnofags tend to say "&gt;LOL Nasu", "Implying that counts, I don't like it so it doesn't", or something similar to discredit shit when they've lost.<br><br>Then they usually fall into the usual traps of "Implying he's not the strongest character in Type Moon".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If something has no concept of death, how can it die?</br>  <br>Its both, I think.<br><br>And an archer Herc would probably be OP as fuck.<br><br><br>Just because you can't "kill it" doesn't mean you can't destroy it with brute fucking force.<br><br>Ain't it how that dude,Ado or whatever, killed types in Notes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nothing personal kid. <br>The Batwing just solos.</br></br>  <br>Tohno might as well be the strongest glass cannon, until Nasu said lol he cannot kill everything.</br>  <br>You see shit even during his game that he can't kill<br><br>Are you stupid? They bring you through how his ability works, how there's reprocussions, and how he can't see the death on quite everything. Although usually he can force himself to see the death in something by trying to see it harder, which causes his brain to partially explode.<br><br>He can only kill things with a concept of death for starters.<br><br>Any Aristotle would not have a concept of death because they are perfect beings, unless you can forcefully fuck them wit a concept of death like with Black Barrel. A perfect being cannot have a flaw, it cannot have death.<br><br>Arcuied is the exception since holding back almost all of her power all the time causes her perfection to weaken, and even when she wouldn't normally have a concept of death she has one during certain times like during the day time. Although she says she would have no such thing at night.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Aoko that high </br>  http://pastebin.com/LKnwp3v8<br><br>My favorite overpowered type to date.</br></br>  <br>It forces a concept of death onto them.</br>  <br> You see shit even during his game that he can't kill <br>Like what?</br></br>  <br><br>You don't know shit it turns out<br><br>Q: Who is stronger, Gilgamesh or Arcueid (30%)? While Arcueid has the strength of 4 Servants, I remember there being a scene in hollow implying that Gil was the equivalent of 5 Servants + a.<br><br>A. In the definition of Arcueid's strength, there's this thing where "her output changes according to her opponent". As an absolute order taken from her backup, the planet, she is allowed only an output a little stronger than her opponent. And. Single entity abilities of Arc and Servants are roughly on the same level<br><br>Servants use their respective Noble Phantasms while Arc uses her unlimited backup to fight, and differences occur depending on affinity. A simple-is-best Arc is an all rounder, and so generally her chances of winning are only high, but there are those opponents that she just has helplessly awful compatibility with.<br><br>For example, in cases where even if the guy's stats are about the same as Arc, he has a ridiculously large number of weapons with high versatility. As the amount Arc is allowed to take out is based on "single entity ability", against types like Gil-sama, well, you see?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If we're talking only about EXTRA and CCC, she's (Arcueid ) about the only one who can bring the Golden Fur White Face down "to circumstances where its possible to defeat her, however little the chances may be". <br><br>Caster gets no respect for how powerful she can actually get.</br></br></br>  <br>An object has no concept of death since it's not living in the first place.<br><br>Yet Tohno can still rip them apart.</br></br></br>  <br>Having no concept of death doesn't automatically make you invincible. You can walk up to a vampire in the middle of the night when it is at it's strongest and least likely to die and stab a stake through it's heart and drown it in Holy Water, it'll die. MEoDP isn't an end all ability, everything has shit it's weak to. Brute fucking force happens to be a valid method in most cases.<br><br><br>Ado's sword got bigger depending on which Type he was fighting, the bigger the better.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Having no concept of death means you have no concept of death.<br><br>Death is an impossibility for you at the conceptual level. Even if the body is destroyed you won't die for sure.</br></br></br>  <br> 30% Arc </br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RBi<wbr>G4xwNWdk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Bitch can even hurt types.</br></br></br>  <br>The Types do not have Gaia's concept of death.<br>Shiki can see death because she is connected to Akasha, and therefore by everything that is part of Gaia.<br>Shiki's powers are incompatible with the alien Types.<br><br>Shiki does not literally see "death"; she can perceive something's "lifespan" or something like "the total span of this thing's existence", and with her Mystic Eyes she can eliminate it, and so instantly "killing" it<br>Aristotles do not have this. Even when annihilated by the Black Barrel, their existence does not end. The concept of their existence is a constant, even if the form changes. Arceuid is a similar, but much lesser creature, though in ideal conditions such as her Archetype Earth state she reaches the level of "beyond a concept of death", as would a fully incarnated Type Moon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then they won't die when they are killed.</br>  <br>Something people don't seem to understand; she doesn't just wig out and go SSJ 1000 percent power mode whenever she feels like. She has to hold back all of her power due to blood lust, her sister cut her hair which also weakened her, and an ancestor has this whole thing about how they hate waste so they use just +1 of the target.<br><br>She cannot go 100 percent at will, it requires special situations or her fighting an opponent that is as strong as her full self as her power will be risen up through the Gaia boost to her real self.<br><br>People always go "Pfft, doesn't count, she's clearly not taking it seriously because she's just 30 percent, if she was serious she'd go full power instantly and win in a second against anyone so nothing counts if its 30 percent".<br><br>She cannot go full power SSJ at will, against these types of enemies she needs to use her Gaia boost to go beyond her means, but she cannot do that against Gilgamesh since in terms of power he is not above her even if his power is above her.<br><br>30 percent is the maximum output she can afford as long as certain factors are in play like her holding back her blood lust. If we take personality into account, then its a huge part of her character that she'd rather die than stop holding back her blood lust and become someone else that's not her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This.<br><br>It boils down to this.</br></br></br>  <br>Correct<br>Pictured: Type Venus, not dead some time after being killed</br></br>  <br>Types cannot be killed.<br>Even being hit with an arbitrary amount of damage and forcibly given the concept of mortality, Type-Venus did not die. It just stopped moving. In its own words, it could get up and fly away at any time, if it wanted to sacrifice the humans living on its back.</br></br>  <br><br>Planets are so fucking OP in Nasuverse when they are just big celestial bodies damn.</br></br>  <br>"Big celestial bodies" aren't important. When earth's soul dies, earth stops being a relevant location.<br>The important thing is the soul which gives life and meaning to the planets, lifeless rocks don't mean a lot. The planet-souls, however, are a godlike universe unto themselves.</br></br>  <br> Shirou was never servant tier <br>Confirmed for never having read the VN. Archer&gt;Shirou&gt;Gil&gt;Every other servant.</br></br>  <br>Confirmed for never reading the VN.<br>The only servant Shirou can beat is Gilgamesh.</br></br>  <br> Implying Lancer couldn't have wrecked everyone but Hercules if he wasn't literally Command Sealed to job </br>  <br>Bullshit. UBW is a stronger GoB, no matter how much Nasu tries to make Shirou an underdog. He is stronger than Gil and kills him easily. He can do the same to every other servant just like Gil can.</br>  <br>The Fifth Nigga. She went to The Root and came back while retaining her humanity.</br>  <br><br>Fuck I'm not even a huge Type-Moon fan and even I know it's supposed to be one of the Type's which as far as I understand are like living embodiments of the planets.<br><br>Personally though I kind of agree with the old adage from Marvel comics and have even kind of seen it play out in Type-Moon before particularly with the servants and that is that the more limited the power the more overall interesting the character.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He would have lost against Archer if Nasu wasn't retarded and contradicting himself. UBW kills every other servant with little effort.</br>  <br> UBW is a stronger GoB <br>No it isn't. Shirou doesn't have literally every weapon ever stockpiled in there. He cannot instantly pull out the counter-weapon to every hero and situation until he has seen every counter-weapon to every hero and situation, and at no point in any of Shirou's lifetime does this happen.<br><br>Willing to bet they didn't even go through 1/1,000,000th of Gil's arsenal in the climactic battle before he decided to pull out Ea.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes they do you idiot. If it can break, or degrade at all it has a concept of death. Tohno understands the death of objects and so can kill them.</br>  <br>Except she loses control when she takes severe damage as it happened in Ciel's route. When this happens she goes Warcueid and can access 100% of her powers. Whether she likes to or not.<br><br>This is not even getting to the fact that were she to lose herself Archetype Earth would take over as stated in KT and as it happened in Roa's story.</br></br></br>  <br>Since Alaya is in some ways an aspect of Gaia, is Alaya also "dead" in Notes despite humanity's survival?<br>Could a "Type-Man" emerge?</br></br>  <br>Wrong. Archer only has noble phantasms numbering in the thousands. This is not enough to overcome any situation, and only enough to overcome Herakles six times.</br>  <br><br>The fanbase is alright when contained to their own subjects, it's when they try to talk about literally anything else that it's a problem. Some of them are capable of holding their shit together regardless, but others just really take the cake even among obsessive otaku and guess which ones like to hear themselves talk more and are 100% assured of their absolute righteousness.</br></br>  <br>I don't think he would be able to pierce Herc's God Hand with UBW, and Lancer's Protection From Arrows probably gives him an advantage over Shirou. However, you're right I can't see some servants doing shit to him with UBW up, like Fake and True Assassin.</br>  <br> every counter-weapon to every hero and situation <br><br>You say that as if Gill has a counter weapon for everyone wen he doesn't. He has jack shit wen it comes to Karna's kit and its probably the same with Arjuna's Gandiva.</br></br></br>  <br>CCC Gilgamesh sacrificed 9/10ths of his treasury before the start of the game.</br>  <br>TYPES aren't meant to be interesting characters in the sense that they have flaws and goals.<br><br>Its more that they're Eldritch horrors far beyond humanity, to the point that hearing them described is pretty interesting in this post apocalyptic setting where humanity is on its last verges fighting against things that would look down on them as ants.<br><br>When you hear Cthulu described in certain tales of Eldritch beings its pretty monstrous and beyond belief in itself. The setting itself makes them more interesting seeing humanity brought to their limits at the end of the world brought about by these monsters bigger than life.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Shirou is Type-Man, the embodiment of humanity's hopes, dreams, and desire for justice. </br></br>  <br><br>Honestly everything just kind of stupid when it involves Gilgamesh since his entire power level revolves around the fact that he is supposed to be the first hero and has all these gimmick weapons in his vault to counter others. That's pretty much it, that's his power since otherwise he just sits around and makes smug chatter at the rest of the cast. Nasu REALLY fucked up making him the final boss of most routes since he's just so SNK Boss tier and not really interesting at all.</br></br>  <br>Bitch can time paradox all over to get what she wants. Even Arc doesn't want to deal with that shit if she doesn't have to.</br>  Archer was too busy trying to kill his ideal to shoot NPs like bullets like Gilgamesh does, so Shirou was able to keep standing back up and advancing on him.<br><br>Gilgamesh was too haughty and wouldn't recognize Shirou as an actual threat until it was too late, which let Shirou keep standing back up and advancing on him.<br><br>Shirou didn't appear capable of minigunning NPs like both Archers could do with GoB or UBW. Shirou really would've gotten his shit pushed in by a Servant who was fighting seriously, because his flesh and blood human body wouldn't be able to keep up.</br></br></br></br>  Ameterasu  <br>If Gil actually bothered to learn and make use of all of the treasures in Gate of Babylon he'd be a hundred times more bullshit than he already is. He could Mega Man nearly every other Noble Phantasm on top of having Ea. You could have Assassin Gil do shit like walk around completely invisible with Hades' Cap of Darkness and shank all the other Servants/Masters with proto-Rule Breaker. Then again there's not much reason to when you could also just brute force everything with Ea, but there's a ridiculous amount of untapped potential beyond "magic Gatling Gun"</br>  <br>Crimson Moon and Archetype Earth do.</br>  <br><br>I like to think of it this way. If Gilgamesh were a character in No More Heroes he'd probably be Million Gunman.</br></br>  <br><br> Ameterasu <br><br>Nigger are you talking about Madara? What level Madara?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course "Type-Moon" is the exception, he's the title character.</br>  <br>I would read the fuck out of that.</br>  <br>That's entirely inaccurate<br><br>Gilgamesh at the end of his route in CCC sacrifices 9/10ths of his treasury to get to the near side of the Moon from the Far side, which is noted to be something of an impossible feat to get past the last firewall. The fact that he did the impossible is just paramount for the character himself, kind of like Karna's feat in the game.<br><br>Gilgamesh broke into the other side of the Moon after he heard that his master from CCC when he made it to the other side of the Moon would be without a servant, he would be deleted the second the Mooncell realizes they're without a servant. His previous servant was a berserker who broke his contract the second it couldn't find him(its thought that his previous servant was Enkidu, since MC during Gil's route has a dream from Enkidu's perspective and even Gil notes that it shouldn't work like that).<br><br>For someone who had gained his interest to that degree he would not allow them to die so readily in such a half assed manner. MC had become basically a treasure worth all of his other treasures, so he wouldn't let them fall so readily<br><br>Although according to Gil hismelf he has an NP that can call back all of his lost NPs into his vault without much effort. So it might not be the biggest loss.<br><br>Gilgamesh even with a fraction of his treasury then finished the contest out on the near side with MC.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He means the solar goddess of power level 387420489.</br></br>  This is a Light Novel thread. So, /a/, what are you reading and why isn't it My imouto thinks he's otouto.  This isn't an LN board. I don't get why LNs are any popular in the west to begin with, if you want Japanese prose just read classic stories like New Rashomon or Futaro Yamada's stuff  <br>I have never heard of MITHO.<br><br>Is it about a masculine little sister?</br></br></br>  <br>That's not its actual name. And she isn't that masculine, just thinks she's a boy.<br>Kind of like Yukimura from Haganai.</br></br>  <br>I don't think anyone reads Light novels looking for good literature.</br>  <br> I don't get why LNs are any popular in the west to begin with <br>More LNs are getting adapted to anime, that naturally raises interest. Then there's webnovel, who are free on the internet and makes it easier for "translators" to edit whatever the fuck google translate spits out. Needless to say, there are also some legitimate translations from people who most likely enjoy and want other people to enjoy reading LNs, so basically:<br><br>Increased interest plus easy access are making more people read them and some like it enough to make threads on /a/.</br></br></br></br>  Reading cute mahou shoujo spider, Kumo desu ga, nani ka?  <br>Damn, second volume already?</br>  <br> This shit again. <br>I don't care about prose nor god tier stuff, that's why I watch anime and read manga you fucking faggot.</br></br>   Reading poorly translated LN's   There's not much to read as of late, at least for me.<br><br>I've gone through my backlog and started binge reading wuxia a lot to make up for the hole of light novels and web novels. <br><br>Nothing to do. Kill me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tried Kumo Desu Ga, Tensei Shitara Slime or Kuro no Maou? All three of those are getting daily updates.</br>  <br>This _is_ an LN board. We want to leisurely read about OP protags and cute girls. It's not difficult to understand.</br>  <br> I don't care about prose nor god tier stuff <br>Then you should definitely take his advice and read Futaro Yamada.</br></br>  <br>Catching up with the Korean Zombie translation. For someone who lets himself get pushed around by the girls so easily, Ayumu sure got his priorities straight.</br>  <br> This _is_ an LN board. <br>It's not, fuckface.</br></br>  <br>Ayumu ended up with a pretty happy harem so he ended up better than a lot of LN protagonists.</br>  <br>Futaro Yamada's pretty cool. His novels are the stuff that birthed a lot of things that are characteristically "shonen" today and he pretty much invented ninja fiction, but reading it feels much more like reading wuxia, most definitely a good thing because wuxia's balls-to-the-walls insane and doesn't let up.<br><br>This is an anime and manga board, in fact. /jp/'s the LN board so go bother them, though the userbase is identical nowadays.</br></br></br>  <br>So harem end? I don't see any other way to make them all happy.</br>  <br> Reading poorly translated manga <br> Watching poorly translated anime </br></br>  <br> though the userbase is identical nowadays. <br>Not quite. I'd never go to /jp/ talk about anything.</br></br>  <br> reading <br>Nerds</br></br>  <br> I post all my Japan/General stuff on /a/ because "/jp/ is too weird". <br>Hilarious. Even mods support this idea nowadays.<br><br>Quoting your fucktarded inner thoughts by the way, in case you were wondering.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Manga and anime get by with visuals which don't need translation, whereas LNs can very easily be ruined by poor translation. If you ever, ever see a sentence like "even if you say that" just close the document immediately, you won't regret it.<br><br>Compare the shittiest threads on both boards (monsterfaggots on /jp/ and on /a/ those roleplay threads where the OP writes 3 incredibly thick paragraphs into which he inserts whichever anime babe he feels like and addresses the entire board like we're all playing a VN) and you literally won't see a difference. All of /jp/'s old guard has left to IRC and spinoff boards and what's left spouts unfunny warosu memes, and the same situation's pretty much played out here as well.</br></br></br>  <br>The anime make him more of a passive personnage than he really is. He didn't stole his reputation as a pervert in the LN, always tell dirty joke to sella, try to take by surprise Haruna when she's changing and so on. <br><br><br>Not an official one but that's pretty much it.</br></br></br></br>  This was a nice surprise, I thought I would get some localized bullshit like most fansubbers did.<br>And Izuna isn't bad as well.</br>  I can't believe no one has read this one.<br><br><br> I Can't Believe I Feel in Love with the Alternate World Version of My Crush After I Got Her Number in a Deus ex Machina Way While Never Minding the Strange Area Code!? </br></br></br>  <br>Do you have to shit up LN threads? They've been allowed on /a/ for ages so why not just get over it? <br><br>Finally got around to catching up to Altina translations. Volume 3 was pretty good but it seems like Volume 4 is going to be about Altina's brother and his love interest instead of Regis and Altina. They seem like they'll be an interesting act to follow but I really want to know what's going on with Regis and Altina too.</br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that MG threads were literally picked up off of /a/ and moved to /jp/</br>  Last things I finished up were Shimoneta volume 1, ARIEL volume 1, and Altina volume 8.<br><br>Going to take a break from reading for a little bit so I can focus more on work though. Plus Altina is the only currently running series that I actually care for and I've only got one volume left before I'm caught up, so it'll be nice to let it pad out for a minute.</br></br>  <br>Wasn't that just some plot someone made up in the previous discussion thread?</br>  <br>Every. Fucking. Time.</br>  <br>Yes, they and "weaponized /a/" basically killed the board, but even before that the board was slowly dying and turning into a dedicated space for people dumping kancolle and touhou images they found by sorting by score on danbooru. <br><br>Plus, what does that say about a general if it's so bad that no board would accept it and it literally got forcefully inserted into a dying board with a small userbase?</br></br></br>  Has anyone read C³? Do they actually explain properly what the fuck was going on in that mess of anime?  <br>Stop making Keit-ai into a thing. It's never going to be a thing.</br>  <br>It speaks more about /a/ than anything</br>  I kind of want to read the LN version of Tensei Slime after seeing the LN images. Looks like Milim's visit got basically stretched out for an entire volume or something.  <br><br>I run through them daily and then I go through everything else I know of and I have quite a bit of sites bookmarked.<br><br>Kuro no Maou is slow as fuck too and simply put it's too fucking slow. <br><br>It doesn't have to be one with a godmode MC that moves the plot fast as hell, but not a fucking snail's pace like Kuro no Maou.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Does Altina ever grow enough balls to take her bookworm husbando or is she still just acting like a jealous girl when another girl flirts with MC?</br></br>  <br>Yeah Kuro no Maou is really slow paced but I guess it's to be expected with how small all the chapters are, plus how the author loves to jump to other characters for different view points.</br>  <br>At least as of translated chapters, I think Altina is still too innocent to realize she likes Regis.</br>  <br><br>It's just mindbogglingly grating reading Kuro no Maou, in the beginning things were going at a fantastic pace but once Kurono met his Fairy wife it just hit a fucking wall.</br></br>  <br><br>If we're talking about the translated chapters then yeah, she definitely obvious to her own feelings but anon said he read Vol.8 so I hoped Altina made some progress.</br></br>  <br>I don't think the beginning was all that fast paced. It was just Kurono getting mentally and physically fucked up by the experiments. About 6 or 7 chapters of that and then a few chapters of him escaping. I mean it could have taken a whole lot longer if Sariel had actually felt inclined to chase him but she didn't.</br>  I'm reading "I don't Like My Oniichan at All!" It's pretty great so far.  <br>tensei slime is enjoyable so far. the translations are still very lacking at times, but not as bad as before.<br><br><br>i honestly would rather read the LN version as well. can anyone make comparisons?<br>the art doesn't fit that well though, at least in terms of the fantasy aspect.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the author wants to try to develop as many characters as possible for the readers to care about what happens to the side characters and to hate the crusaders even more. I think he takes it a little too far though.</br>  <br><br>I mean as in development, MC gets summoned and slave collared, he learns magic and fights in experiments, and then runs the fuck out due to the accident.<br><br>Things were happening, but once he reaches the village, MC just settles in and does nothing much in regards to plot. Just SoL for 20 fucking chapters.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well isn't that understandable though? I mean his entire reasoning for smuggling himself off the continent to another continent was because he wanted to get as far away from the crusaders as possible and hopefully live a peaceful life. <br><br>It's just that wasn't to be.</br></br></br>  <br>I think for Tensei Slime the overall story is the same, just that stuff got more fleshed out like usual for LN versions.</br>  <br><br>I just can't handle it man, Wordmaster has these short and sweet tidbits of SoL between the plot instead of the SoL taking the limelight.</br></br>  <br><br>it already got an anime adaptation...</br></br>  <br>As of volume 8 there's still no real romantic development. I actually think it's kind of cute; it's not like she's full on generic tsundere, and she is still practically a kid (though I think around volume 6 or so she turns 15 which is their age of majority).<br><br>I'm not so much mad at her for not getting it, just that the author is clearly jerking the readers around. Regis gets called away from their army for a while and the night before he leaves she:<br> Has a conversation with Regis where he mentions a political marriage between her and her half brother, and forces him to admit that he actually has a purely personal interest in that not happening <br> Hugs him <br> Tells him to stay with her until the morning and that he can sleep in her bed if he wants to <br><br>At this point, unless the author is a total dick, the writing on the wall is clear enough that even Altina has to realize how she feels eventually. At which point it will obviously just be Regis being a fucking putz that shuts it down instead.<br><br>It's hard for me to be mad about it because despite the fact that Regis is a pussy magnet the series itself stays away from the generic harem stuff most of the time, and if it didn't I'm sure I'd just fucking complain about it turning into generic harem crap.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The SoL there was part of the plot though. Kurono was trying to settle down in a peaceful place.</br>  Found out it ended so started reading Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria  <br><br>I wish there was a better translator, or at least more of them. I have to end up reading the translations from BakaTsuki and some of it is grammatically wrong, And it's not finished. I wish could read Chinese. (It was only in Chinese at the website I was trying to buy it at)</br></br>  What happens when Japan runs out "good" LNs to adapt into anime?  <br>Enjoy your endless magic highschool harems</br>  <br>They might finally hop over to adapt the more popular manga and visual novels.</br>  <br>But they're not even adapting the good ones</br>  <br>That will likely never happen.</br>  <br>When that happens, they will go back to adapting the popular stuff.</br>  <br>Sequels.<br>Sequels everywhere</br></br>  <br> Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria <br>i couldn't really get into it for some reason. didn't even finish the first volume though.</br></br>  <br>That design gave me a boner. Please tell me the translations are updated regularly.</br>  Reading Log Horizon 1 from a convention bargain bin. Got it used for 3 dollars despite it being released earlier this year.  <br>It's baby first edgy LN, you didn't miss that much.</br>  <br>They'd have to start adapting them first.</br>  I'm currently reading Kono Subarashi Sekai e Shukufuku wo and Shomin Sample. I've tried reading Yahari, but it is way to Japanesey to understand what the nerd is saying.  <br>It's over on Sky's site so decently frequently? Translation is going through volume 3 now.</br>  I never knew reading something I already saw in the anime would be so enjoyable  <br>My first thought was that it's about a sister that's a trans, but after remember it's a LN, this probably isn't the case, is it?</br>  <br>Someone already explained it like two posts in.</br>  I never thought it would actually happen, but the entire series is almost done.  Currently reading hikkikomori-tachi ni ore no sheishun ga etc.<br> All that references <br>Also for an LN with lewd dialogues, illustrations itself aren't lewd at all.</br></br>  Fuck off back to /jp/, fucking LN shitters nobody wants you.  <br> It's over on Sky's site so decently frequently? <br>Didn't he drop it?</br></br>  <br>Translation of volume 3 started so I would assume not?</br>  <br>mad</br>  <br> Not localized Shiritori <br>Seems like not all hope is lost for professional translations.</br></br>  <br><br>Synopsis for this reminded me of Fire Emblem</br></br>  Rakudai is getting an anime next season, right?<br><br>How much is it covering?</br></br>  <br>Hopefully enough for me to see this semen demon getting a good dicking</br>  <br>It will probably just be the standard 2-4 volumes in one cour.</br>  I'm really enjoying "Kumo Desu Ga, Nani Ka?"<br><br>Anyone else reading that?</br></br>  <br>Can't remember all the details, but here's some.<br><br> Milim follows Rimuru around and does mischief, not sure if Charybdis was awakened in the WN version but it causes a lot of problem for the people of Tempest. Took all of them a shitload of time to reduce Charybdis' hp by 30%.  But Milim oneshotted it for them. </br></br></br>  Any moon reading friends wanna tell me how the Ookami San LNs end?  <br>Sounds fun, as expected of one of the oldest Demon Lords.</br>  <br>I really like the series' artwork. Doesn't feel anything like a typical LN</br>  <br>A lot of people. I'll probably pick it up too, I'm running out of things to read.</br>  <br>Seems like the LN version added more "SoL" moments. Looking forward to it even though I'm already done reading the WN.</br>  Anyone else reading this? Pretty nice fantasy series.  <br>I'm enjoying it. I really, really want Kumoko's story chapters to connect up to the Side Story chapters but that still ages away.</br>  <br>I'm fine with it since it looks like it gave us a bunch more adorable Milim.</br>  <br> Threadly reminder that you should stop posting that because it's a thing. <br><br> https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3206<wbr>139/1/</wbr> </br></br></br>  Kino no Tabi.<br>It's okay, I guess.</br>  <br><br>What exactly happened at the end in the WN version? I'm not sure I understand. Did he just go back?</br></br>    <br><br>Same poster huh?</br></br>  <br> He did since one of those sliders from the Empire stayed behind in Tempest and discovered how to travel between worlds, so Rimuru split himself into 2, sending one part back to modern day Japan with a certain devil accompanying him. Seem like Rimuru could switch consciousness between his 2 selves. </br>  After reading chapter 62 it seems odd that the kids don't react at all to the comment about Rimuru being friends with a Demon Lord but maybe they were still more in shock about his one shot of the golem.  Should I stick to the LN translations of Regarding Reincarnated to Slime or should I read ahead the WN version?  <br>There's people translating the LN version?</br>  <br>I'm reading both, but the WN translation is much further ahead and much faster.</br>  <br>The same group translating the manga is doing the LN too but they're only at when Rimuru met the goblins.</br>  Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is some good shit. Just finished Volume 4  <br>Fug, I remembered wrongly and now I can't delete this post. Here's the correction.<br><br> He did since one of those sliders from the Empire stayed behind in Tempest and discovered how to travel between worlds. Rimuru traveled back to modern day Japan and heals his old self with potion and sent a certain devil as his bodyguard. Seem like Rimuru could switch consciousness between his 2 selves and he tells his colleague about 'regarding reincarnated to slime'. </br></br></br>  <br>Is this translated by chance?</br>  So, /a/, why haven't you written your own shitty self-insert fantasy novel yet? Do you really think you're worse than the shit getting published right now?  <br>I've started and scratched a lot of worlds in a lot of settings myself, but never went past worldbuilding. Not a single paragraph.</br>  <br>Gotta write shitty self-insert fanfiction first, then step up to the next level.</br>  <br>But I already am. <br><br>It's just that I'm a hack, so despite having the middle and end already thought up of, I can't write filler/the beginning. <br>Stuck at creating the mid-bosses and plot for the begin; already have the setting, world building, technology and cast. <br><br>Not planning to do things half-heartedly or leave plot-holes, so I've been mainly editing for now. <br><br> /blog </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not politely saging for blogshit </br>  I know I am reading shitty LNs. Mahouka and Rokka no Yuusha. I finished reading Gifting a month ago and honestly found it enjoyable.  Can someone help me with finding out the reference of the cover images of Kono Subarashii Sekai? <br><br>I know the 1st one, but after that it's a blur. The 6th one seems really familiar but I can't put my finger on what it is.</br></br>  <br> s-sorry, forgot </br>  Question for moonreaders, how do I get good enough to read LN?  <br>I hope Volume 17 doesn't disappoint.</br>  <br>You  visit the daily threads and  _____________git gud  </br>  <br><br>I'd like to know too.</br></br>  <br>Reading Rokujyouma, damn Kyoutarou is pretty good harem MC. And all girl is best girl. I hope translation can catch up with the nip source.</br>  <br>what's it about?</br>  <br>Why hasn't /a/ made its own LN?</br>  <br>Because there's no viable market for Light Novels in the US. It came and went with Haruhi.</br>  <br>They already have. It's just that no one gives a shit about Original English Language anime or light novels.</br>  <br>What previous discussion thread?</br>  <br>Move to Japan. It worked with No Game No Life.</br>  <br>Have you tried to write self-insert trash?<br><br>Requires a certain mindset. I can't do it, feels awkward as shit.</br></br></br>  <br>This happened. The sight is still up if your curious.</br>  <br>nigga I read LNs for fantasy wish fulfillment series about a fantasy series in which an MC (hopefully female) learns magic, obtains OP powers, gets a harem, and fight demons.</br>  <br>Female MC? With a harem? That sounds like an otome game instead.</br>  <br>it's kinda funny how most of the series worth reading seems to have the least generic artwork <br><br> Slime Dan <br> Overlord <br> MT <br><br>It's like the illustrators puts in as much of an effort as the author.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not automatically assuming it's a female harem </br>  <br>Tensei Slime's artist has a neat style.</br>    <br>Lately it makes me wonder.</br>  I downloaded Kikou Shoujo wa Kizutsukanai.

Also best confession. </br></br>  <br><br>Here's something extra.<br> Yes, this was included in the final story volume. </br></br></br>  <br><br>Okay i can die now</br></br>  <br> &gt;best confession <br> Do tell, I mean I drop the series when they where hopping around places and blond jesus was getting her new power and shit  </br></br>  <br>ah, I read that one. The translations on Baka-tsuki are pretty slow. how many chapters are translated?</br>  <br>is MG's translation still stuck on the 12 or 13th chapter?</br>  <br>14th came out 11 days ago and they said they'd be trying to get to one chapter a week but yeah.</br>  <br>it'd be nice if they do release it weekly. Also, seems japtem's website doesn't show the updates on their mainpage.</br>  <br>You have to refresh usually to make sure the site is actually updated.</br>  <br>ah you're right. it updated. MG is pretty fun to read so far.</br>  Not sure why some people reading Kumo Desu Ga think the side stories and main story are happening concurrently. It's so obvious there's a time difference between them since there's no way Kumoko spent years fighting bees after all.  <br>Basically, she told  Layfon and Leerin that if the world were to end, she would want to die by his side. <br><br>Even Layfon's density couldn't counter that.</br></br></br>  <br>HOLD THE FUCK UP<br>SHE WON?<br><br>I DROPPED Chrome regios WHEN NINA WAS BEING JESUS</br></br></br></br>  New manga chapter of tensei slime just dropped.  <br>Who else could've won? Meishen got rejected, Leerin rejected Layfon, Claribel is too much of a combat nut to prioritize love and Nina is twice as dense as Layfon.</br>  <br> Milim <br>I always thought she had yellow hair</br></br>  <br>It is now fucktard</br>  <br> worst girl won <br>fucking dropped</br></br>  <br> Felli <br> worst girl <br>Shit taste.</br></br></br>  Reading Dawnbringer as enjoy the whole galactic warfare and mc being frozen after 120 years as an admiral and losing his hero status shit. Since nobody cares anymore even though he was the one who got the crushing victory against the aliens.  I want to start reading Kuro no Maou but im kinda doubtfull, does at any point become a revenge story or does the MC do anything ''great'' or once he escapes it becomes a permanent Vinlandsaga's Farm Arc? If it has action does the MC just get dragged into it or does he take the initiative? I'll read it at some point anyways, but these days i have been in the mood for a revenge story with an assertive MC that grows through the story, something like the first part of Vinlandsaga  <br>It becomes pointless suffering, dont bother. Author tries way too hard to get the symphaty of the readers and whats worsw that it became a harem shit that its so fucking out of place trying to fit all that harem stuff beside the sufferig.</br>  <br> tfw you will never abuse your rank in space <br><br>Damn you 21st century</br></br></br>  <br>so he never get's any kind of revenge or something to make himself respectable?<br>Thank you a lot, i'll avoid it then</br></br>  <br>I don't know how the translations(?) are like but I've loved the WN for quite a while so basically... it's suffering and the author is slow as fuck in pacing but things do gradually turn brighter. Especially once you get past the initial period the story is pretty fun.<br><br>Now if you want to be spoiled...<br><br>This is the general flow of events:<br> <br>Part 1: The protagonist suffers from human experimentation, eventually escapes and finds peace with his fairy waifu but the peace didn't last.<br><br>Part 2: The village he peacefully lived in was attacked by the crusaders and everyone he knew was brutally slaughtered. The protagonist raged and slaughtered the soldiers. It's revealed that the fairy waifu is not a cute mascot, it's a yandere in disguise.<br><br>Part 3: Under advice of fairy waifu, protagonist gathers some people to try and escape the influence of Crusader and go over to the neighboring kingdom. At this point, witch waifu joins the party, at the latter parts, shota waifu also joins.<br><br>Part 4: Witch waifu has extreme talent in magic but is unable to control the power causing her to easily end up toasting the enemy and allies. She was recruited by fairy waifu precisely for her talent of mass destruction. Shota waifu invented guns by himself but was looked down upon as creating useless weapons. The protagonist recognized the value of his inventions. Fairy waifu gets jealous of the shota waifu.<br><br>Part 5: They and dozens of brave adventurers barricade themselves to buy time for villagers to escape. With machine gunnery, they make the crusaders take heavy losses. Eventually they were forced to retreat.<br><br>Part 6: They successfully escaped, however what awaited them was despair. All of the evacuees were massacred by an apostle waiting ahead of the road. As the protagonist, fairy and witch fight against the apostle, all of the adventurers were massacred by a second apostle. The protagonist also lost the battle and lost an eye in it but had his life spared.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People are born without brains.</br>  <br>I tried to read it yesterday and didn't even manage to get through the fucking prologue.<br>Then I skimmed through the first 10 chapters and barely anything happened.<br>Skipped up to fucking 97 just too see what would happen, and what did happen?<br>MC, at chapter 97, is barely able to shoot a ball of magic.<br>There's a limit of how slow you can take it.<br><br>And reading your spoilers, only sounds like that the author is trying very, very hard not to fall into the overpowered MC category and is his series is suffering because he can't write it properly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> <br>Part 7: The protagonist and his companions successfully escape to the neighboring kingdom. The protagonist is depressed, understandably. However he received the divine protection of the self proclaimed previous demon king of the continent (cute loli/shota, gender unknown) who also restored his missing eye.<br><br>Part 8: Adventurer life begins, this is where the story turns a new leaf and the protagonist begins to rise from the bottom of the barrel.<br><br>Part 9: The witch waifu officially joins his harem. She was revealed to be a yandere as well, as a result of the reveal, fairy waifu and witch waifu start plotting on how to kill each other when it comes down to it. The protagonist is oblivious. <br><br>Part 10: The protagonist gains more and more powers. He has gained a liking of using cursed weapons and armor because his ability allows him to control them, making them plainly strong weapons. He begins the attendance of school to learn some common sense of the world generating school antics and also fairy waifu and witch waifu turn out to be rich as fuck so they bought two horses and some high quality armor for him. In the setting, buying a horse is the equivalent of buying a car.<br><br>Part 11: Yandere tendencies escalate. Fairy waifu is now performing human experimentation, witch waifu is now performing human sacrifices.<br><br>Part 12: While fairy waifu and witch waifu are out on a journey to kill people away from protagonist's eyes, a pure and innocent princess gets near the protagonist and grows close to him.<br><br>Part 13: The pure and innocent princess was converted into a yandere that threatens to execute people for getting in the way of the relationship of her and the protagonist. An incident happens, the protagonist sets out to save the day.<br><br>Part 14: The fairy waifu/witch waifu come back just as the protagonist departs. They give chase noticing a new bitch riding behind the protagonist.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br>  <br> Is on 4chan /a/ <br> Says people should only enjoy good media <br> Goes back to watching anime <br><br>Yeah right you have it all figured out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds like a whole lot of shit. Guess I'm dropping it.</br>  <br> <br>Part 15: The protagonist saves the day. However his horse died, from the effect of a cursed weapon the horse revived as a nightmare. Combined with his black and edgy robe and edgy cursed weapons, he unpleasantly received the reputation of being a black berserker. Protagonist insists that he's a mage. In the process, the protagonist's first kiss was given to the shota waifu in the name of life saving.<br><br>Part 16: The princess was NTR'd hard and became a shut in. She was bought back out thanks to a beautiful misunderstanding of what the protagonist told her. Protagonist is still oblivious of his surroundings.<br><br>Part 17: More SoL and adventuring antics. It was cut short as the crusaders finished preparations and war between the two sides is soon to start.<br><br>Part 18: Before war begins, fairy and witch collaborate to shut down other love candidates. The princess in particular was blown out with the reveal that she was masturbating using things like the spoons that the protagonist used. By the way, she herself treasures the eye that the protagonist previously lost and the witch often smells the protagonists old clothes so... no comment. The war begins, the princess is sent back home, depressed, irritated, generally makes you want to ask where her pure and innocent self went.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br>  <br>What the fuck is this shit?<br> Every girl who comes into contact with hum turns into crazy and a yandere?<br>And they know how the MC suffered and what happened, but who cares, let's experiment with humans, sacrifice them, and threaten them with execution because why not when the MC doesn't watch.</br> <br>Dammit, this is even worse than Arifureta or that Forsaken Hero shit.</br></br></br>  <br>And finally:<br> <br>Part 19: The war begins, as usual bullshit like using slaves to suicide attack and other disgusting crap. The finale of the battle begins with the arrival of an apostle (the same one he met during experimentation age).<br><br>Part 20: The protagonist saves the day by confronting the apostle that massacred various strong adventurers. It was a fierce battle but thanks to their new powers, the protagonist ultimately wins. However due to intervention, the apostle attempts to escape through a portal. The protagonist refused to give up and chased her, leaving his companions behind. On a sidenote, there was a second apostle sneaking around like last time but she ended up having to face all of the high powerlevel characters introduced so far and was beaten to pulp then imprisoned.<br><br>Part 21: The ultimate result of the protagonist giving chase is that he ended up chopping off all 4 limbs of the apostle only to then find out that the identity of the apostle is the girl he tried to confess to before getting summoned to this world. In the end the protagonist couldn't kill her. Though he did ended up having violent sex with her.<br><br>For clarifications, it's not quite the same girl. It's more like, she was similarly summoned, had experiments performed on her, her ego was on the edge of being erased, but she awoke to the power of yandere at the very end and engraved her feelings onto the new apostle personality before disappearing. This is what caused the protagonist to be overlooked at the start.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> <br><br>I'm done, I ended spending more time than I expected. Only planned to do a light round up of the story...</br></br></br></br>  I love beautiful yanderes. Best trope.  <br>t-thank you<br>this is some supreme tier trainwreck</br></br>  <br>btw at which chapter does Part 21 happen?</br>  <br>   Protagonist is still oblivious of his surroundings. <br>dropped harder than a ton of bricks</br></br>  <br>Thanks, a good wait to make people not want to read it.</br>  i was wondering which of these i should be reading next:<br> Kumo desu ga, nani ka <br> Altina <br> Knights &amp; Magic <br> Spice and Wolf </br></br></br></br>  <br>Read spice and wolf first then Altina and Knights and Magics</br>  <br><br>Kumo desu ga is fun.</br></br>  <br> They do the experiments/sacrifices on criminals so all's well. By the way, what the fairy waifu is experimenting with is the very ring that made the protagonist's life hell during experimentation. The ring is called "angel ring" and is essentially a brainwash magic tool. Fairy waifu experimented with it to figure out how to use it, then blackmailed... or rather kindly requested the shota waifu to manufacture it. She named the new ring "fairy ring". The witch was performing human sacrifices to receive the divine protection of a god, which she did. She was chosen by a witch who was also a companion of the demon king that gave the protagonist divine protection. <br><br>On that subject, from the fairy waifu's deep love she received new divine protection from the fairy goddess she worships. Apparently the fairy goddess is a fan of pure love and seeing her perform human experiments for the sake of love touched her heartstrings.<br><br>Her divine protection allows fairy waifu to become "one" with the protagonist. They merge, literally. The protagonist becomes stronger and... turns into a woman.</br></br></br></br> <br><br><br>Somewhere in volume 25 of the WNs. Its been months so I can't name the concrete chapter.<br><br><br> In the protagonist's eyes, the fairy and wtich are his cute reliable companions. The protagonist himself is not interested in love yet because of revenge and both of them understand that which is why they chose to not make any moves until revenge is accomplished. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No it didn't that was a joke by the publisher, they were playing on the fact that the second volume contains a story about the MC's LN in the series getting an anime adaptation.</br>  <br>the writer of this thing thing should be hired by some animation studio , that would ensure us a hell of a ride every season</br>  <br> turns into a woman <br>Hawt. Wish there was a manga adaptation of this.</br></br>   that feel when TLers are complete wimps and just cannot stop bitching about MTLers <br> that feel when people won't just ignore bad comments and then throw temper tantrums. </br>  <br><br><br><br>what the actual shit is this i need to read this trainwreck sounding mess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good luck, to reach the end of his spoilers you'll have to read about 500 chapters.</br>  <br>sounds hilarious though just on the sheer retardation that ensues.<br>considering i just read a 1900 chapter series not to long ago i might get around to this.</br></br>  <br> 1900 chapter <br>which?</br></br>  Anything Kawakami is currently the only thing that keeps me interested.  <br>   Restored missing eye <br>Fucking dropped, why cant we ever have battle scarred MCs?</br></br>  <br>The only running LN I'm interested in nowadays is Daidenyuu.</br>  <br>I was mildly let down in Mushoku Tensei in that regard, I was hoping for him to just try and make better and better robot arms.</br>  <br>You'd bitch too when you know just how their "translations" really are.</br>  <br>as a rawfag i can tell you TLers are by and large dipshits.</br>  <br>I can't moon so I'm shy about series with inconsistent and slow translation schedule.<br>But I wish I could read it.</br></br>  <br>The protagonist of クロの戦記 loses an eye at the start of the story and never restores it. Though it's not impossible, he kept it as a reminder of the subordinates he sacrificed that day.</br>  <br>There are loads of good LNs out there I feel don't get enough attention. Pic related is another one of my favorite finished series.</br>  <br>Ping is translating that.<br>I have Book Girl original here and am following his translation, only 8-10 are left to be translated.</br></br>   only 1 chapter <br>Why wont people translate this? Don't they want to be healed?</br>  <br>There are a lot of things out there that people do not (want to) translate and instead focus on these resurrection/summoning WNs which are all the same anyway.</br>  <br>there's no MU entry for this is there?</br>  <br>Yeah I loved this ending<br><br> People getting power-ups like crazy <br> Twists and revelations <br> Final battles incoming <br><br>Felli and Layfon going "Fuck this shit let´s go away and enjoy life"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe he's taking it slow since there's still no release date for the second volume.</br>  Rest of illustrations and extra chapters when?  <br>Earliest in September.</br>  Just started on this, パナティーア异谭. MC saved the world 6 years ago but was summoned again. Was expecting a typical adventure story but it turned out to be a melancholic one where  MC's old friends were either too caught up in their own lives, or are dead/maimed.   <br>Did they remove her horn?</br>  <br>Holy fuck first chapter was comfy as hell.</br>  does anyone have a copy of grimgal vol 5?  <br>whos the archer?<br>is the swordsman paul</br></br>  I'm reading this atm<br>Its really good.<br>I'm also reading Wolf and Spice and A Certain Magical Index</br></br>  <br>Are there translations for this?</br>  <br> is the swordsman paul <br>no<br><br> whos the archer? <br>Rudeus' going to try to have sex with her only to get ED'ed after Eris 'left' him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br> Rudeus' going to try to have sex with her only to get ED'ed after Eris 'left' him. <br>that wasnt in the wn was it?<br><br>so whos the swordsman?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shame.Kinda wanted to read a story about post adventure Yuusha party kawaii somethin something is not enough</br>  <br>Volume 7 was extremely short in the WN.<br>So, they're most likely original characters and the whole volume got re-written, or has at least a bunch of new chapters from his adventure days.<br>Swordsman could be Soldat?</br></br></br>  <br> that wasnt in the wn was it? <br> so whos the swordsman? <br>No clue. There are going to be extra chapters because volume 7 of wn had only 5 and each volume of ln needs 10.<br>It was only briefly mentioned in the wn, that Rudeus tried to boink some chick but couldnt because ED.</br></br></br></br>  The main reason everyone in /a/ hasn't written bestselling harem fantasy trash is because 90% of people can't be fucked to write 10,000 words for anything, much less 75K which is standard for the YA genre which LNs correspond with. The ones who do complete a manuscript have to deal with the soul sucking process of getting published. You have several options, all terrible or expensive. First is to sacrifice all your dignity trying to find a literary agent (who overall have worse taste than all of 4chan) to represent you, which has about a 0.5% success rate. Second is to go with a small publisher who can usually only offer limited release and limited marketing, and you probably won't get an advance or decent royalties. Also, low success rate being chosen that way. Third is to try to self publish. If you don't lay down a good amount of money to have your work professionally edited and if you don't hire a good cover artist your work will look and read like trash and you will not sell more than a handful of copies. Average cost for those can be about $3000 in total for your average YA fantasy.  <br>It's only a matter of time until "Reincarnated to another world" novels are adapted. I'm sure we'll see lots of them.</br>  <br>I'm guessing LNs come out faster than anime, so that's unlikely to happen, the definition of 'good' will just slide. As if half the stuff getting adapted was 'good' to begin with.</br>  <br>Overlord already animated, and there is Re: Zero next. Don't forget about Kono Subarashii who has MC having shit life because his annoying party.</br>  <br>Currently reading vol 12, catching up with Machine Doll. <br>The story is just too good for me with each passing volume I read.</br></br>  <br>Good for you.<br>The translator of that rage-quit and all hope is gone for me.</br></br>  <br>hayashi? I thought he was still translating them. Also, I can spoil you if you want to know something specific.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128714064 <br>You already get tons of that kind of shit in anime, no need for LN.</br>  <br>His last post was a complaint about someone from wattpad posting his translations back in March.<br>I was no update since then, or he switched somewhere else?<br>I simply assumed that he quit.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128714064 <br>Does Saiunkoku Monogatari count?<br>It is a harem, but it's good.</br></br>  <br>I remember seeing a lot of people bitching about Layfon becoming irrelevant by the end while Nina's screentime skyrocketed, as well as about Layfon being mindbroken after Leerin's rejection.<br><br>After reading, I didn't really see how. Layfon still had a lot of presence and got over most of his issues by the time he became a second-year and had several tough battles where got to make important contributions thanks to Composite Blast circumventing his need for a Heaven's blade. Heck, the Heaven's Blades actually ended up getting more screentime than Nina because she hardly appeared in volumes 21 and 22.</br></br></br>  <br>Actually finding interesting template reincarnation novels is surprisingly hard</br>  <br>the best.</br>  <br> my daughter <br><br>So how many volumes before it turns into Usagi Drop ending?</br></br></br>  <br>So the guy with the red shirt is the sister?</br>    <br> Never,because this isnt that kind of story and the MC actually gets to the point he gets to find a lover and they take care of his daughter together </br>  <br> Oyakodon </br>  <br>m00t said that anything that has an anime or manga adaptation goes here and I guess the m00t 2.0 won't step over that with out saying it at least. Honestly the mods probably won't give shit for this, /jp/ is basically the Touhou thread, and their, very occasional, LN threads are all about terrible, this coming from somebody that can stand machine translations of this quasi literature, shit, and terrible Raw shit at that, to make it better for the ignorant that doesn't get runes.</br>  <br>Totally depends on the mod who sees it.<br>I remember several LN threads that were active over the course of at least 2 days and at ~400 posts, in a currently active phase with an actual discussion going on, suddenly being deleted.</br></br>  <br>Didnt that other anon say that volume 2 isn't even out? Are you bullshiting right now?</br>  <br>Possibly? I mean even in chapter 1, MC is mentioning how it's possible she's older than him because of how slow her race grows.</br>  <br>As is Gakuen Toshi Asterisk, which is quite similar in premise. Anyone else liking that one?</br>  <br>He's probably talking about the WN.<br>LN has so far only one volume out, and the ongoing translation is from the LN.</br></br>  <br>Then why you and me even watch anime? We can watch better medium like western TV shows and movies, right?</br>  <br>You're correct, eventhough you don't need to put "shit" before LN.</br>  <br>Hey anons, I was wondering where do you find illustrations for LN?<br><br>Every time I'm looking for them it takes way too much to find them. Are there any websites that have many of them in one place. Hitomi is good but their search function if a disaster.</br></br></br>  <br>1. Search the internet for raw providing pages, there are more than enough.<br>2. Buy and scan it.<br>3. Buy a digital one and remove the DRM.<br><br>There's currently a huge sale till 8/6, a whole lot of them each for 215 yen.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dropped Asterisk because I dislike the MC.<br>And I'm kinda stuck at volume 2 here, I found it to be rather boring and I can't stand the sister.</br></br>  <br>Could you point me in the right direction for that sale?<br><br>I checked Amazon JP and I couldn't find it.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh she is that woman that he said "he try to do it with an adventurer before" right? If I'm not mistaken he hurts her feeling and get slapped because of ED.</br>  <br>http://bookwalker.jp/tag/1035/?orde<wbr>r=title&amp;qtag=1035%2C1035&amp;np=1</wbr></br>  <br>Thank you!<br><br>Also. Nice quads.</br></br></br>  <br>Bookwalker is digital, in case you didn't know.</br>  Has anyone read Aldemarin-something?<br><br>I think I saw something like that being mentioned on a previous thread, and last week I could read the manga.<br><br><br>Is that the new cover?<br><br>Last one was great for those threads about everyone losing but Miyuki.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Has anyone else bought Blade Dance v01 from there? I'd like to compare the files to see if they use any watermarks in addition to their DRM.</br>  <br>Alderamin of the dead waifu.</br>  <br>Yes, that's the new cover.<br><br>I am following Alderamin, finished the first volume.<br>Translation is extremely slow, so I haven't bothered to start volume two yet.<br><br><br>There shouldn't be. There are people on /a/ who post images from digital releases by removing the DRM.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm talking about the text.<br>At in the package.odf-file there's a field that looks kind of like a unique ID...</br></br>  <br>Where's a good source to read english translated light novels from?</br>  <br>Me too, though the long ass politics explanations make me sleep through it.<br><br><br>That blonde captain that was always blaming herself for being weak, turned out to be like the second strongest being in that series.<br><br>Totally out of nowhere and probably to make Leyfon more shit. I don't even care about him, but that was stupid and shit tier.<br><br><br>Fuck you.<br><br><br>It's more about the fact of Nina than him being irrelevant. Since it was not her story, and she is one of the shittiest characters, it makes sense anons raged so much about this.<br><br><br>Is this a korean LN?<br><br>Last one I read was Maian chronicles and never again looked back at those (except for Moonlight Sculptor).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why can't it just simply be a light-hearted yandere series like that yandere yuusha one?</br>  <br>The childhood friend one? I really need more of that.  Uses her ridiculous magic powers to give the MC power ups at critical moments to make him seem more like a hero.  </br>  <br>yeah that one  was it ever confirmed that the yandere brainwashed the princess? </br>  <br>We can try comparing with some free shit if you want to.<br>Here's a preview for DanMachi 4, for example.<br><br>http://bookwalker.jp/dece541d39-a8e<wbr>9-47bc-9e9f-b05db96f3c17/%E3%83%80%<wbr>E3%83%B3%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B3<wbr>%E3%81%AB%E5%87%BA%E4%BC%9A%E3%81%8<wbr>4%E3%82%92%E6%B1%82%E3%82%81%E3%82%<wbr>8B%E3%81%AE%E3%81%AF%E9%96%93%E9%81<wbr>%95%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A6%E3%81%84%E3%8<wbr>2%8B%E3%81%A0%E3%82%8D%E3%81%86%E3%<wbr>81%8B4-%E3%80%90%E7%AB%8B%E3%81%A1%<wbr>E8%AA%AD%E3%81%BF%E7%89%88%E3%80%91<wbr>/<br><br>But I think that's just an epub's version of ISBN. And it still works even if you remove the unique-id.<br>Also, for sharing purposes you don't really have to share the opf file.

Get ready for an entirely different experience, they somehow turned an old grandpa into a young girl for the manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Started reading this<br><br>Yet its only 1 chapter....<br><br>Its a fucking sin why this ain't getting translated</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So there's only circa 200 days until we're there for us EOP, yupee.</br>  <br>Do you mean the ring spirit?<br><br>I was going to read it precisely because the girl.<br><br><br><br><br>Fucking author, WHY<br><br>I thought the princess was the heroine, more like MC likes milfs and all the girls are just companions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Do you mean the ring spirit? <br><br>Yeah. An elderly grandfather type character in the novel.<br><br>It's also a lot less comedic in the novel.</br></br></br></br></br>  man i wish altina had better artwork. the heads are almost always too big.  <br>I like it.</br>  Is there a series similar to Long Live Summons?  <br>Comedy with an overpowered cocky MC?</br>  <br>So Mondaiji?</br>  <br>xianxia comedy with a overpowered cocky MC that's not about "muh honor" like most MCs of the genre.</br>  So what translation projects do you wish weren't dead? For myself I'd like to read more Yuusha Party.  <br>If you just want something different, Law of the Devil has a reincarnated MC that's fucking pissed about it and basically lives out most of his childhood pretending to be retarded.<br><br>After making a deal with the devil, he decides he might as well have fun with his life and starts up a navy fleet called "McDonalds", with its flagship "The Black Pearl". And then he introduces soccer and gambling on soccer to the world.<br><br>And I guess he's trying to become a mage, or something.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>hes also using harry potter as a fake name.</br>  <br> Totally out of nowhere and probably to make Leyfon more shit. <br>It was kinda foreshadowed for half a dozen volumes. <br>And Layfon wasn't really all that shit in the end.  He got over his depression issues after making his resolution to find out the truth with Felli, achieved a narrow victory against Nina's ancestor, reached his goal in Melnsc, distracter Vati B for long enough for the original to vaporize her, helped out Vajra twice, basically saved the Queen by joining the fight against Vati (let's be honest, she wouldn't have lasted as half as long against Vati if Linstence and Layfon weren't there to cover her lack of combat experience), saved Leerin when she fucked up against Vati, provided the opening Leerin needed to deal the killing blow to Vati and killed Dixerio. <br>He may have been relegated to a support role, but I don't really see why he'd be considered useless when his help ended up being indispensable for everyone's shit to not get completely fucked.<br><br> Since it was not her story <br>It wasn't really Layfon's story either. It's basically outright stated that he's a background character who decided to intrude on the main plot even though no one asked him to. It feels like people are just butthurt Layfon didn't end up being the center of the world.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Thank you, based Keit-ani!</br>  <br>Log Horizon</br>  <br>It's not dead.<br>People are just refusing to post to the translation here.</br></br>  <br>so what is this even about? is it good?<br>her stupid face made me lose all desire to read this.</br></br>  <br>The LN was great (at least the two volumes I could read) and the translation was great as well.<br>Finding the parts of her father's corpse and giving him a proper burial.<br>Anything else I know only from spoilers.</br></br></br>  <br>If you're smart enough to learn moon, you're too smart to read LNs. They're mutually exclusive. Unless you're a pathetic Japanese 13 year old boy, or some ESLfag reading machine translated spoilers from animesuki you can't read LNs.</br>  <br>it's not as much as being good enough as it is lowering you standards enough</br>  Anyone got the Durarara baka tsuki novels?  <br>you can still find pdfs at m*******</br>    <br><br>Thank you good sir.</br></br>  <br>You're a good man, anon.</br>  <br>why aren't 2, 3, 11, or 12 translated?</br>  <br>pic related<br><br><br><br>Thanks, I update and upload a lot of stuff there. I actually uploaded the MTL pdfs of vanadis and vol 11 a few hours ago.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There are lot of retarded people who know moon, way too much, I'd say. It doesn't have much to do with being smart, just keeping yourself motivated.</br>  <br>seems like the same illustrations as Magicraft meister</br>  <br>Those are the people that end up translating manga and LNs and getting it 90% wrong, then getting pissy when you tell them they fucked up.<br><br>I've looked at scanlations for some of the series I have hard copies of, and 9 times out of 10 the scanlations aren't just worded poorly, they're outright wrong. I don't think I've ever seen a haremshit LN that had a good translation.</br></br></br>  <br> they're outright wrong <br>i hear this a lot, but do you have ay examples?</br></br>  <br>Thank you, based Keit-ani!</br>  <br>oh yeah that's right. I forgot the reason was something involving fujos or tumblr</br>  <br>Are those the exact number of letters on the website?</br>  <br>who knows anon?</br>  <br>Cheeky cunt.</br>  <br> but do you have ay examples? <br>Can you read Japanese to look at the raws and compare them to scanlations?</br></br>  <br>so you can't?</br>  <br>Not him, but I'm ESL and I have real examples from books translated by professional translators from English to my native language.<br><br>"A bit long in the tooth" was translated too mean that the character had big teeth, "courtier" was translated to "courier", third of a watch was translated to third watch. It's just from a few pages of a fantasy novel translation that I once compared to the original. There were more mistakes but I don't remember them.<br><br>The strangest things was that some parts just obviously didn't make sense because of the mistranslations. Couldn't the translator look up "long in the tooth" in some dictionary?<br><br>Now, if people that do it for a living make so many and so stupid mistakes then how many mistakes are there in fan translations? Maybe it's not true but based that's what I always assumed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Whoever recommended Arifureta, fuck you, why would you put me through reading such garbage?  <br>Why would you ignore all other 100 anons telling you it's shit?</br>  <br>I can, but as someone who can read moon I just buy manga when I want to read it. Why would I have a side by side image of a raw and a scanlation to compare? Even if that were the case, why would you trust me when I say "This line is wrong" if you can't read it and confirm it yourself? People who like reading shitty manga and LNs are far too willing to lap up whatever shit translation they read first.<br><br><br> The strangest things was that some parts just obviously didn't make sense because of the mistranslations. <br>This is the one that gets me. In the past when I'd look at a really horrible scanlation and the English words just didn't make sense, it was clear that they tried transliterating the words with no understanding of grammar in Japanese and as a result no understanding of the passage. I can't fathom why anyone would think that's ok.<br><br> Not him, but I'm ESL <br>Had you not mentioned that I never would have guessed, your English is great.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I doubt anybody recommended it.</br>  <br>/a/ keeps telling you that it's shit, why didn't you listen? If you're still in the mood for amateur chinese writings read Jashin Average instead, it does the whole ported over to a RPG world thing much better and it's pretty short.</br>  <br>Don't make me pick this up, anon.</br>  <br>It has dragon sodomy.</br>  <br>The LN art is by Takayaki, I have no clue if the story changed. Either way, it stays shit.<br>I simply downloaded it for the art.</br></br>  <br><br>Someone recommended it months back, around the time mushoku tensei's final web novel chapters were being translated. I decided to pick it up in between reading other things because it was in my backlog. I regret it but I actually bothered reading up to around chapter 92. Some of the shit that happened just made me cringe or audibly question parts. I had nothing better to do. <br><br><br>it's pretty bad</br></br></br></br></br>  Reading Irregular's Rebellion. About halfway through the novel, and despite the school setting and frequent comedic tone, I'm enjoying it.<br><br>Story's about all-time record-breaking elite students forming a squad together at basically a magic military academy in a fantasy world. However, after they band together, it skips ahead a year and the protagonist is for some reason now very unmotivated to do anything, the elites he formed a squad with are gone with no explanation aside from him, and he's repeating a year at the academy. The story primarily takes place with his new (terrible) squad, but the story occasionally shifts back to the past with the elite squad, making you wonder how it could have possibly have even gone wrong in such a short amount of time.<br><br>I haven't read far enough to why shit went down, but  I assume the title gave it away and there was some sort of rebellion. Ha ha, spoiler titles. </br></br></br></br>  Where can I read this?  <br>This thread can be read on 4chan.</br>  <br>Where can I read the LN?</br>  <br>In Japan after purchasing it from a manga/anime/LN shop.</br>  Anyone tried reading Blue Steel Blasphemer?  <br><br>4chan doesn't have an LN about it, you silly goose.</br></br>  <br>Like every good anon should do</br>  <br>Do you mean to tell me that there are anons who don't do that?</br>  <br>I'm interested in knowing as well. I've been meaning to eventually check it out, but as there's only one volume with available scans out, I haven't motivated myself to read it yet.<br><br>This image from it looks neat though.</br></br></br>  <br>why go to japan and buy when I can get for free?<br>are there no translations for this Imouto sae Ireba Ii?</br></br>  <br>There are scans for only one volume because there's only one volume out so far.<br>Guess on the backlog it goes for now.</br></br>  <br> why go to japan and buy when I can get for free? <br>Sorry, I thought you could actually read the novel as opposed to begging for some Japanese 201 student to shit out a vague interpretation of a story he can only half understand. My mistake.</br></br>  For those following THE NEW GATE, the first part of volume three is out.  <br>Do you happen to have the rest of the illustrations for The New Gate's novels? I didn't think it had public scans anywhere.</br>  <br>The manga art is so shitty but it kinda shows how alof Shin is.</br>  <br>No, I never found any scans.<br>Only what's on the translator's page.</br></br>  <br>You can find it in Shin's translation page</br>  What would you rather:<br><br>The MC gets used to the new world he is reincarnated/summoned, or<br>The MC changes and introduces new stuff to the civilization?<br><br><br>I am, thanks.<br><br>The white elf Schnee(?) is my favorite girl so far.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That Tiera outft, wow.</br>  <br>it's not bad, but it's the type where the MC and his party is insanely op compared to the rest of the world. i hope they keep it interesting. <br>overlord does it decently</br></br>  <br> The MC changes and introduces new stuff to the civilization? <br>You mean introducing Japanese foods because he just so happened to have memorized how to make fucking soy sauce, or introducing the concept of bathing because 'medieval Europeans didn't have the concept of frequent baths and only Japan did'?<br><br>God Japan pisses me off sometimes. But seriously, it depends on what the protagonist will introduce.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think either setting can be interesting. I like in Death March that the gods actively sabotage any of the efforts reincarnated/summoned people make to advance civilization out of the fantasy medieval state it's in.</br>  <br> What would you rather: <br>An author capable of an original idea that isn't a self insert escapist fantasy aimed at idiots who like to pretend they're smart and just need a fresh start in life.</br></br>  <br>well we need more than just a fresh start<br><br>but the "entire fantasy genre" is liked for a reason.</br></br></br>  <br> but the "entire fantasy genre" is liked for a reason. <br>And that reason is not "introverted loser falls into a new world just like his video games and manga and gets to be super awesome".</br></br>  <br>Sure Fantasy was made before video games<br><br>but that was what the fantasy genre was made for. To be a special snowflake with magic (or bullshit martial arts skills).<br><br>every single one of them</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but that was what the fantasy genre was made for. <br>It really wasn't. People just like the setting. It was never about some normal otaku loser ending up in the fantasy world with the story revolving around how fucking cool he is. It was always about some magical adventure of a group or friends or heroes or something to that extent.</br></br>  <br>first few medieval fantasy stories were about a knight getting super holy powers and killing dragons<br><br>just because it isn't Japanese doesn't mean it isn't wish-fulfillment dude.</br></br></br>  Ok, this is a rec post so if you don't like those, fucking skip it.<br><br>To make it short, I'm going to Japan soon and I want to bring back things that you cannot find (yet) outside of Japan, namely a LN. Does anyone know of a nice LN that would actually be better among the big load of trashy stuff? I was thinking about betting on the most known things and perhaps get a Haruhi or Monogatari (Kizu?).<br><br>Any idea?</br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck LN<br><br>get manga and h-manga instead</br></br></br>  <br><br>Not really. Not at all even. Tolkein's stuff, which is what most fantasy is based on, was basically just an excuse for him to make up an language, make maps, and create fictional history, cause that's the type of thing he found fun. <br><br>The majority of protagonist characters in Tolkein didn't have bullshit magic, or really any magic worth a damn.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kind of sad that it doesn't seem like we're getting a chapter of Death March today. I'm looking forward to this arc since I heard that  Satou meets Hayato this arc. </br>  <br> just because it isn't Japanese doesn't mean it isn't wish-fulfillment dude. <br>You're right. There are things like Slayers, LoLH and Arslan Senki. If it's Japanese and it's a shitty LN/WN then it's absolutely self insert wish fulfillment.</br></br>  <br>I think you misread what he was telling you anon.</br>  <br>Don't bother. He thinks fantasy wasn't just about cool world building and setting, but actually that it was always a ploy for magical wish fulfillment.</br>  <br>Yeah that annoys me too. I meant introducing maths, science, practical stuff, etc.<br><br><br>Didn't satou invent some hair dryer? <br><br>Didn't know the gods were keeping things in the medieval like state though.<br><br><br>The oldest thing I can think about right now is precisely the old Greek stuff about heroes and gods, etc.<br><br>It's not new, and tales tend to be amusing so people can aspire to be heroes and so on.<br><br><br>The only stuff I ever wanted was that masked man edition cover for Misumarca Monogatari. Nowadays there are a lot of raws compared to before. Maybe 憂鬱なヴィランズ that has awful and incomplete raws.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's not new, and tales tend to be amusing so people can aspire to be heroes and so on. <br>I can not believe you just drew a parallel between Greek epics and LNshit. The fact that you can't differentiate between a tale surrounding a young man on a journey of growth and discovery from a tale of a lazy, plain boy being handed magic powers (or "potential" as they like to disguise it) and a harem is amazing.</br></br>  <br>The gods only get in the way if it's introduced in a big way. They're not going to care if it's just an individual doing it.</br>  <br><br>Speaking of which, does anyone know where <br><br>YES, LOLITA! NO, TOUCH!<br><br>First came from? Death March uses it a lot but I'm pretty sure they didn't start it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like Kimito Kogi's stuff, but it's available online.<br><br><br>So the downloads online for Yuuutsu na Villains are incomplete? I remember seeing 1-5 somewhere.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 憂鬱なヴィランズ <br>Yeah, most of its scans are complete ass. I also need to check out his new work soon. Guy likes villains. All I know about it is apparently the protag is part of a family of monsters or something, and the heroine wants the protag to literally eat her. Fun stuff.</br></br>  <br> So the downloads online for Yuuutsu na Villains are incomplete? I remember seeing 1-5 somewhere. <br>It's technically completely scanned, it's just the early volumes have missing pages, and the scans are horrendous. I recall only one of the missing pages seeming to be important based on the before-and-after context.</br></br>  <br>That's also on my list but those can be found easily in my country. Whereas LN are totally inexistant in Frogland.<br><br><br><br>I'm not necessarily searching for something untranslated but I'll look it all up, thanks.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>on the subject of things that annoy people in transported series.<br><br>That part where the MC decides to ignore the social structure of the kingdom he is in because "Medieval Europe is the only place with a aristocrat/peasant class structure"<br><br>Some people are annoyed by the cliche that the Japanese language structure is the same as the language structure of whatever medieval area they are in, but at least that makes more sense than the above one because the Japanese language was fucking BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CLASSES!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Greek epics are pretty shit, though.</br>  <br>You will have a hard time finding something that's actually being translated, is worth the buy, and has missing scans.</br>  <br>His next argument will be "They're inherently better than LNshit because they don't feature powertrip, self-insert garbage for lonely weeb neckbeards."</br>  <br> That part where the MC decides to ignore the social structure of the kingdom he is in because "Medieval Europe is the only place with a aristocrat/peasant class structure" <br>That's actually a bit vague. Ignore as in punching a king in the face?</br></br>  <br>Is that the one that is literally a SAO self insert fic?</br>  <br>Yeah, new cover and PV of chapter one out this Friday. Mayumi and Mari were surprising choices for the cover. Who knows who the guy in the back is, I guess it is Hirofumi Itsuwa but others think it is Tatsuya. I'm curious to see more faces of other clan members.</br>  <br>Isn't the process of fermentation for soy sauce so long winded that one wonders how they invented it in the first place?</br>  Still waiting for Gekkou's Stubborn Will of the Crescent Moon chapter  <br><br> I vaguely remember hearing about Homers Odyssey in middle school so I know Greek epics are shitty <br>Ok.</br></br></br>  <br>Why do the gods in Death March and Gate care about keeping the world in the medieval age specifically? Why not the Bronze Age, or antiquity, or the Renaissance era, or the age of steam? What is special about the medieval period?</br>  <br>Which is why I only asked for a LN that you could advise, without being specific. Information on 憂鬱なｳﾞｨﾗｲﾝｽﾞ is hard to find, and my moon knowledge is very limited kanji-wise. I'll try a bit later, slightly tired right now.<br><br>Thanks again.</br></br></br>  <br>And then Rudeus took it in the opposite direction and started superimposing a modern Japanese corporate structure into his situation instead, making Orsted the company president and roleplaying what appears to be some kind of fantasy of being a white collar worker salaryman/corporate slave, complete with company provided health insurance.</br>  <br>I'm just speculating but maybe because it allows for maximum magic efficiency? probably not the right world but oh well. If the world started going past this level of technology, people would start having lots of magic substitutes so the value of magic would start to fall. Also it would start giving people lots more power over the world which the gods would hate. I mean they already have the Source in each major city that allows them to do crazy powerful things but that's limited to the ruler of each city and kept secret.</br>  One of the things I learn about MT is that most of the cliches were either ignored or made fun of<br><br> Rudi bitches about Japanese food <br> finally finds ingredients for his favorite food <br> shares it with friends and family <br> they react with a "meh" and starts questioning whether Rudi has weird taste <br><br> MC tries to show off his manners to a Asuran noble <br> noble beats him for doing it wrong and the household instructs him how to do it properly <br><br> MC plans a strategy that will solve everything <br> plan backfires due to his own stupidity and people (including him) dies and gets injured as a result <br><br> MC starts declaring vengeance on someone and does everything to achieve said vengeance even going as far as killing <br> he achieves jackshit and has to start all over killing him in the process <br> past MC is sicken by his actions <br><br> Eris wants to join adventure guild, hunt goblins, and explore labyrinths <br> MC responds by questioning the point of that <br> and that's the end of that <br><br>either that or the cliche is given to other characters<br><br> Zanoba is the one with super-human strength and a loyal loli slave that was bought near-dead and nurtured back to health <br><br> Slyphy is the right hand of the royalty <br><br> Eris is the adventurer archetype that goes through powerlevel progression <br><br> Roxy is the experience veteran that can do anything if given enough prep-time <br><br> Nanahoshi is the transported character that introduces modern tech to the world  <br><br> Orsted is the OPMC dragonborn with a katana, white-hair and thirst for vengence (and Perugius) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some books from Yen Press can be found through Amazon's US website. I have found the Bungaku Shoujo series in digital format that way.<br><br>Another way is to look at Baka-tsuki's abandoned projects to see if something is licensed already.</br></br></br>  Si no one besides me reads hikaru?<br>This is deppresing</br>  Hachinan update finally came. Getting closer to the  legal wife's appearance.   <br>Where Can I read this?</br>  <br>Interestingly, Risou no Himo Seikatsu has the MC introducing Arabic numerals so nobles couldn't escape taxation.<br><br>The thing that pisses me off most in WN/LNs would be the nobility treating peasants like shit. Or huge battles where the nobility sent their peasants to die for no reason.</br></br></br>  <br>what happens in it?</br>  <br>Mc gets his first fríends and oh surprise is a ghost named hikaru(harem king)<br>It basically is mc ntr'ing his ghost fríends to give his girls closure</br></br>  <br>MC's parents really piss me off. <br><br><br>All the chapters can be found over at infinitenoveltranslations. Some of the chapters are pretty bad quality though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>MC is doing the girls a favor. He solves issues while Hikaru let things stagnate. If Hikaru was still alive, all the girls would be in a much worse place.</br>  <br>Yeah Mc is great but hikaru let the things like that because he was Not decisive enough to break things up with them</br>  <br>You know, I love stories about people willing to do anything for the one they love. Like in HakoMar. Maria and Kazuki are willing to go to insane length for their loved ones.  Both of them are moral humans, meaning that both feel hurt whenever they commit something like murder.   Yet still they do it. <br><br>It's the same thing in Saya no Uta, the cast can be described in many negative ways but they are still able of going to great lengths for their loved ones. <br><br>And before people start saying . "But That's Yandere."<br><br>It's really not the same thing. Yandere girls has turned into <br><br> MC looks at another girl, welp it's time to kill her. <br><br>instead of accepting that the other girl might be better option for MC. Take Maria  when she sees that Kazuki is happy in the fake world, she accepts it, even if it hurts her. She thinks of his happiness above all else . <br><br>I don't even know why I'm ranting, suppose it has gotten late and I got nothing better to do. <br><br>Either way I'd love to see more of these kinds of characters. Too bad Hakomari is finished.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The thing that pisses me off most in WN/LNs would be the nobility treating peasants like shit. <br>It's how the things worked back then.<br> Or huge battles where the nobility sent their peasants to die for no reason. <br>Here I can agree, good generals never senselessly wasted troops. Unless you mean using peasants as cannon fodder, then fuck you.</br></br></br></br>  Reading through Horizon. It's very confusing.  <br>You should try the anime.</br>  <br>I did and I still have a hard time following the story, jargon, and the characters.</br>  <br>Here's a chart for quick reference.</br>  <br>I appreciate it. Any other LNs you recommend?</br>  I really want to read that one LN about a guy who's mother turns back into 17 and becomes his girlfriend or something  <br>But then pre-medieval era of antiquity would be even better in that regard.</br>  <br>But Anon, that chart doesn't tell me which one wants to fuck which one.</br>  <br>The Vamp! novel is an entertaining read, and it also has one of the more creative explanations for vampirism that I've read.<br>The series is fully translated and downloadable with some searching.</br></br>  <br>Yeah I have no idea, I'm just speculating. It's easier to guess reasons for why they don't let it progress rather than why they decided on that specific level of civilization.</br>  <br><br>it just got a manga.<br>with this, i hope it succeeds and author continues for another 20 volumes</br></br></br>  <br>So Hikaru is a dense harem lead and the MC has to give his harem the D for him?</br>  <br> Pleb sample <br>Oh yeah</br></br>  <br>Hikaru wasn't dense, at least going by what I read of the manga, he was just amazingly indecisive. <br><br>Also Tensei Slime's daily update is up.</br></br></br>  <br>thought the kid's arc would be a complete waste but I'm kinda liking it.</br>  <br>How casual Rimuru is about the crazy things he does is great though I wonder when he tripped the Chloe flag, just when he slipped out of her water prison and patted her head?</br>  <br>I wonder why he didn't ask the great sage about what the fuck happened to Chloe? <br><br>I mean it's good that she's stabilized but if it bites everyone in the ass later.</br></br></br>  sin is dead again.<br>I should really just learn nip already but I have no time.</br>  <br>Great Sage probably wouldn't know? I mean Great Sage is basically just a super encyclopedia + analysis tool but even Ramiris here who is an expert on spirits and things had no idea what the spirit Chloe called was. <br><br>It was probably her future self or something along those lines.</br></br></br>  If Archer has had a lifelong obsession with swords and has sword technique that made Berserker cry manly tears of joy fighting him, why was he not a Saber?  <br>Because his reality marble and the way he fights with it aligns him more with what one would call an Archer. Yes, hes got great sword skills, but what makes EMIYA EMIYA is UBW.</br>  <br>Archery clubs does wonders to a man.</br>  <br>The Saber class is biased and only wants laser spamming fucks with top-tier stats.</br>  <br>Because he spams projectiles, the same reason Gil was summoned as an archer despite having a cheat code in the form of EA. I don't know if Gil can be summoned as a Saber though</br>  <br>Honestly, from the sounds of how things were explained, I think he has little to know actual hand-to-hand competency, aside from of course nature of just being a damn servant. He might be able to be summoned to the class caster or something.  Well maybe not, I doubt he did any magic while he was alive. </br>      <br>He didn't have high enough stats.</br>  <br>And needs a real important sword that ties with his legend.</br>  <br> The strength of his ability is unknown. <br>Gary Stu in a nutshell.</br></br>  <br>Because he actually fucking sucks at sword fighting. Though he's not as bad as Gil, he can't compete with real swordsmen without falling back to archer tactics.</br>  <br><br>Seconded these, if you want to be Saber you need a fucking sword that when everyone heard of it they would immediately know that is you and only you.<br>Honestly K&amp;B is not even his isn't it?</br></br></br>  <br><br> not as bad as Gil <br>Give the man a break, swords weren't even used for combat when he lived.</br></br></br>  <br>What's EA supposed to be, anyway? Alien technology? Future technology?</br>  <br>A Drill sword <br><br>Archer's fake swords like his K&amp;B don't make the cut.</br></br></br>  <br>It's something that's not real, yet closer to the truth than anything.</br>  <br>Making shit games and stealing more money by DLC, that's why Gil is rich.</br>  <br>Well he was living with Taiga, that counts for something.</br>  <br>He should have been a  Baker </br>  <br>The only magic he can use is UBW related shit, you can't be called a Caster and only good with one type of magic.</br>  <br>Alien probe technology.</br>  <br>Because Arthuria works better as Saber.</br>  <br>The reason why the videogame industry is so shit.</br>  <br>A demonic/divine weapon related to the myth of creation.<br>It's probably just a myth representation, and Gish never uses it for full strength (destroy the world) during the grail war.</br></br>  Imagine if you summoned Shimon, collect your free HGW win.  <br>Archer has some magic skills aside from UBW that Shirou doesn't, but they are hardly enough to become a caster, which requires some magicku beamu skills.</br>  <br> but they are hardly enough to become a caster <br>According to Fate/Ace Royal he can but it's not the most trustworthy source so take that with a grain of salt. We'll probably see one way or the other once Grand Order comes out.<br><br> which requires some magicku beamu skills <br>Tell that to Gilles</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Makes insane heracles be sane by killing him 6 times <br> Heracles says he wished he was not crazy so he could fight Archer that has a superb Sword Technique  <br><br>Fuck off with your bait faggot</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's fundamentally not a user of swords but a creator of them. <br><br>The process of creation is also a metaphor for the Japanese kyudo ideal.<br><br>There's a deceptively low-key conversation Shirou has with Mitsuzuri that explains this. It has to do with the Japanese conception of the ideal archer. In the Japanese ideal of archery, the target isn't even considered. The battle is a mental one. If the archer visualizes the procedure of the shot perfectly and can make his body follow that procedure, he'll hit every time. Losing your ego and devoting your entire self to the shot is the desired result of years of Japanese Archery training, but Shirou's been that way since the fire.<br><br>And Shirou never misses. Ever. The one and only time he missed, it was intentional, to see what it felt like. That's why he quit the archery team, he had already achieved mental perfection for archery and the bow was unnecessary.<br><br>Shirou casts magic the same way he performs archery. Eight steps to traditional Japanese Archery, eight steps to projection, eight lines of UBW, etc.<br><br>And visualizing the arrow hitting the target before it happens is analogous to visualizing and holding the pattern of the sword in his mind before actualizing it from this RM through projection magic. If he himself is a sword, the sword will be perfect. Archer was bemoaning the fact that he hadn't even realized that fact yet when he fought him in UBW.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gilles has the  cool  book that does pretty much everything for him, he's a really shitty caster stat-wise.</br>  <br>It's basically just a cookbook for sea monsters with infinite ingredients. It can't do much beside that.</br>  <br>Or you can be Gilles, or Andersen, or Shakespeare, or Dumas, and not actually be good at any type of magic.</br>  <br>It can also do Item Creation and some enchantment.</br>  <br>Source?<br>All the magic we've seen Gilles do was with the grimoire, it may very well be his focus.</br></br>  <br>On the other hand, he's got good upper body strength.</br>  <br> the rest of humanity sucks so much that there hasn't been a hero in ages <br> but here's this guy who somehow is better at sword fighting than ancient heroes even though there's no way he'll get that type of experience in modern warfare <br> oh and he's also super good at archery for no reasons at all <br><br>Fucking Gary Stu</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Stomped by Cu <br>I guess Heracles would fap to Cu then?</br></br>  <br>Or Lancelot.</br>  <br> oh and he's also super good at archery for no reasons at all <br>You're talking as if most ancient heroes weren't born with super magical bullshit and actually trained for those abilities.</br></br>  <br>It was obvious so I didn't mention him. I guess he also fapped to Kojirou and would fap to Karna?</br>  <br>He gets superpowers because he was suckered into becoming a glorified janitor for all eternity.</br>  <br>Why are Casters who suck at magic always the best Casters?</br>  <br>Lets forget the whole fact that he had one of the most powerful sword artifacts meld with him while he was growing and just bash nasu.</br>  <br> somehow is better at sword fighting than ancient heroes <br>But he sucks, he isn't even the best of his era of shitters. No EAM.</br></br>  <br>You either suck at magic or suck at life.</br>  <br>Because magic is really shitty in the HGW since over half the Servant classes have Magic Resistance.</br>  <br>It's important to note that Gilles has no prana source during the HGW.</br>  <br>The book doubles as a battery.</br>  <br>Only Saber is able to repel almost all magic attack though. The other class's resistances are not that good.</br>  <br>Seiba no-sells all her magic as you said<br>Rider has B Resistance<br>Lancer C<br>Archer D (he kicks her ass in every encounter)<br>Herc has God Hand<br>Assassin works for her.<br><br><br>Literally every opponent of Medea has an advantage against her primary form of attack.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He isn't the most skilled Knight in the round table for nothing.</br>  <br>Depends on the Heroic Spirit. EMIYA has Rank D MR while Gilgamesh has Rank A in Fate/Zero (Which is weird since he only has E in F/SN) even though they are both of the Archer class.</br>  <br>Doesn't Archers magic resist get boosted because of Kanshou and Bakuya? Or is the D rank taking that in to account already?</br>  Rei or Asuka?  Blue is my favourite colour.  Shikanami a shit  Whichever pisses off the most people.  <br>(you forgot to add Misato)</br>  Shinji.        <br>That ass is flat. 'Animation team fuckup' levels of flat.</br>      <br> Or </br>  <br>Down with the tsunbitch<br>This is REAL best girl.</br></br>    <br>back when he was still with us...</br>  <br>What's moot?</br>  <br><br>Asuka Soryu</br></br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  And after what I have to choose the best take both.  Rei.  <br>Asuka because I'm a masochist.</br>  Misato  <br>Asuka because I prefer a real person</br>  Asuka has better rape doujins while Rei has better prostitution materials.  Rei  <br>I'm going to marry Asuka-chan!</br>  I'd like to imagine that I'd hate anyone with the personality that Asuka has. The truth is my past few girlfriends had strikingly similar personalities to Asuka. Guess I'm a masochist or have a thing for red headed psychobitches.  Rei all the way!  How can any fucking autist prefer Asuka over Rei? <br><br> asuka <br> annoying <br> rash <br> slut <br> shit at piloting evas  <br> has to be saved all the time <br><br>Rei is better in every other way holy shit<br><br>Only reason why someone would prefer Asuka is if they overlooked personality for looks, which is completely immature</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Liking Asuka over Rei is immature.</br>  Rei because in the end would come after me.  <br>Asuka may have a shit personality but Rei has no personality. Asuka has the opputunity to grow out of her bitchiness and at least I can connect to her and comfort her on some level. Rei is a cold shell. She isn't supposed to exist and she knows it. She will never connect to you emotionally because she knows she's an ancient being that created the human race trapped inside the body of some build-a-bear styled girl. The only time Rei would be a better choice is if Third Impact is coming soon.</br>  <br><br>Not being perfect is just human.<br>Why would someone prefer someone like Rei who is in barely any way like an actual human being.<br><br>Asuka is the way real girls often are, especially at her age. But Rei is just as much of a fucking fantasy as Kaworu. <br><br>You know what´s immature? Liking a character that´s 2deep because it makes you feel mature and prefering her over a realistic character like Misato or Asuka. It´s just delusional and escapism.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think your post just explained why people choose Asuka over Rei.<br><br>They don't understand the characters. They're making a mistake.<br><br>Rei has a personality and she actually shows progress in growing out of her coldness. She meets Shinji and forms an emotional connection with him in the series, and through Shinji as well as the others is capable of analyzing and understanding herself better eventually leading to some of her problems solving or easing up.<br><br>Asuka on the other hand doesn't show capability to grow like Rei does, and is more likely to self-destruct internally than accept her own flaws and do something about it. That's how the series ended.<br><br>Then Asuka has issues that makes her have no personality. Unlike Rei who is more free in what she thinks, Asuka is locked down to following the role NERV assigned, to be an EVA-pilot. She has no personality because she just clings to that role mindlessly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not being perfect is just human. <br>Who said Rei is perfect? NGE sure as hell didn't.<br><br> Asuka is the way real girls often are, especially at her age. But Rei is just as much of a fucking fantasy as Kaworu.  <br>Some are, some aren't. Asuka is equally as much as a fantasy because of these facts:<br><br>1- She is not real. She is a cartoon.<br>2- Even as a cartoon, she has poorly developed "ideal traits" such as being a child prodigy who graduated with some unspecified college degree, and is a special snowflake since she's a "chosen" pilot and all.<br><br>"Immature" is not realizing the two and pretending one cartoon is more real than the other.<br><br>There are far more Rei's in this world than there are Asuka's. Rei is the model of an unfortunate, tragic and systematically neglected child, who there are far more of in this world than spoiled early graduates. (That's a sad fact FYI)<br><br>No, anon, escapism is parading your own choice of a cartoon character as "better" because it's more realistic, which makes it the ultimate form of escapism since as pointed out earlier, neither of them are real.<br>Pretending Asuka is real is more or less entering an even deeper state of escapism and self-delusion.<br><br>This is why this: <br>is the logical and mature way to see things, despite how immaturely it was worded. As a person, Rei is far more admirable and meaningful than Asuka is as a character. Asuka's only achievement is imitating life, while Rei's character does both that and achieves giving us some understanding and appreciation for life. Rei might one day make life imitate art, despite how scary that might sound.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Then Asuka has issues that makes her have no personality. Unlike Rei who is more free in what she thinks, Asuka is locked down to following the role NERV assigned, to be an EVA-pilot. She has no personality because she just clings to that role mindlessly. <br><br>Now that´s just bullshit. You might as well say you don´t have a personality because you do what your boss tells you at work and then you do it.</br></br></br>  Why not misato?  <br>Rei because I prefer her and it's funny how mad she makes people.</br>  <br> Now that´s just bullshit. You might as well say you don´t have a personality because you do what your boss tells you at work and then you do it. <br><br>If you do so in the same way that Asuka does, then yeah. Asuka doesn't really have a life outside piloting.<br><br>If I took away your work, you could start at another place if I offered you the job. If I said Asuka couldn't pilot any more or she couldn't, then she'd kill herself just like she attempted to do so in the anime.<br><br>Asuka isn't "just following orders" from her boss, her entire personality and self-worth is based on being what someone else wants her to be. She's entirely dependent on it, her entire person is, and her brash personality is therefore essentially something NERV gave her.<br><br>Compare with Rei, who is extremely obedient but - isn't at all dependent on being obedient. That is if we took away Rei's job, her purpose, then she'd still move along at her own pace. Rei not being able to pilot doesn't harm her self-worth. <br><br><br>OP didn't ask. Misato is best woman though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Gendo  <br> Who said Rei is perfect? NGE sure as hell didn't. <br>I´m just saying that Rei isn´t nearly as flawed as any other character except for Kaworu who is literally Jesus. Rei doesn´t hurt anyone.<br><br> she has poorly developed "ideal traits" such as being a child prodigy who graduated with some unspecified college degree, and is a special snowflake since she's a "chosen" pilot and all <br><br>Who cares about that? That´s not why people like Asuka. <br><br> There are far more Rei's in this world than there are Asuka's. <br><br>Not where I life. I can not recall to have ever met anyone who is remotly like Rei. <br><br> unfortunate, tragic and systematically neglected child <br><br>You mean Shinji?<br><br> Pretending Asuka is real is more or less entering an even deeper state of escapism and self-delusion. <br><br>Fucking strawman. I never said she´s real just that her character comes closer to that of a real person.<br><br> As a person, Rei is far more admirable and meaningful than Asuka is as a character. <br><br>So what? She´s not realistic in my opinion. Shinji is, Asuka is, pretty much any Eva character is except her. That´s why I prefer Asuka.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I´m just saying that Rei isn´t nearly as flawed as any other character except for Kaworu who is literally Jesus. Rei doesn´t hurt anyone. <br>She slaps Shinji, inadvertently hurts Asuka's pride, and makes Gendo so crushed he falls on his knees by the end of the series.<br><br>There's more to being flawed than hurting others. Rei hurts herself, and is emotionally stunted. She lacks social understanding. These are flaws.<br><br> Who cares about that? That´s not why people like Asuka.  <br>People who like Asuka care, and you're wrong in asserting it's not a reason. You can't ignore a part of the character because it doesn't suit you.<br><br> Not where I life. I can not recall to have ever met anyone who is remotly like Rei.  <br>You live in a better part of the world, and people like Rei are usually either in therapy, locked up in some basement or out in the wild (literally). There's more damaged and abused children in this world than there are early college graduates. Even where you live probably, but I don't think you hang out around psychiatric wards or similar places.<br><br> You mean Shinji? <br>Him too, but Rei even moreso.<br><br> Fucking strawman. I never said she´s real just that her character comes closer to that of a real person. <br>Not a strawman, but the truth. You're allowing yourself to delude yourself into thinking the character is more real or realistic, when in reality they're both cartoon character that are just as realistic with their stories and development put into context.<br><br> So what? She´s not realistic in my opinion. Shinji is, Asuka is, pretty much any Eva character is except her. That´s why I prefer Asuka. <br>Your understanding of what is realistic isn't very developed, and it's not a measure of what makes a great character or a great person. <br><br>There are plenty of nice, docile and uncaring yet well-meaning people in this world, not everyone is a bitch. There's no intrinsic value to being more realistic either, consider an eccentric person IRL. Is he unrealistic?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry but this Asuka doesn´t have a proper personality won´t become a new maymay. Not as long as I´m her.<br><br> her brash personality is therefore essentially something NERV gave her. <br><br>Where did you get this idea from. She was told she would be a pilot and then decided she would do her best to gain respect. She came to that decision because of her shitty parents and everything not because of NERV.<br><br>The fact that she cares so much about being a pilot is the point. She extremly pround and strong enough to show her intentions. You say she doesn´t have a real personality because of that but dude, that is her personality.<br><br>Rei has nothing she cares about. You can tell her she has to pilot the EVA one day and the next day she has to become a scientist or whatever. She doesn´t do what she does because she wants to. Essentially she just pilots the Eva because Gendo wants her to not because she wants.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sorry but this Asuka doesn´t have a proper personality won´t become a new maymay. Not as long as I´m her. <br><br>You self insert as Asuka?</br></br></br>  <br>You don´t?</br>  Less arguing more Eva girls.  <br>When we say "you have no personality" we mean that you don't have anything you'd call your own to show off. <br><br>Like you said, Asuka was told to pilot, told she was chosen etc... and that's what she is. She shouts louder than average, but it's what's she's shouting not how loud she's shouting it that matters. Her caring about being a pilot so much is purely the puppetry of NERV as an organization, they wanted her to be a pilot and made sure she became one. In other words, Asuka's personality is the personality NERV wants her to have, to perform her best and to be the best, which only gains NERV. Not Asuka, there's only pain and suffering for her down that road.<br><br> Rei has nothing she cares about. You can tell her she has to pilot the EVA one day and the next day she has to become a scientist or whatever. She doesn´t do what she does because she wants to. Essentially she just pilots the Eva because Gendo wants her to not because she wants. <br><br>All of this is directly disproved in episode six though.<br><br>Shinji: Why do you pilot?<br>Rei: Because of bonds...<br>Shinji: Bonds?<br>Rei: Yes, a bond.<br>Shinji: With my father?<br>Rei: No. Bonds with all people.<br><br>Rei in the anime seems to care about people as well as the bigger picture, plus getting to understand herself better. Rei would gladly comply to help people she cares about but not as a rule, as Rei is easily capable of leaving people she cares about hurting and desperate, abandoning them if she doesn't see it fit to help them.<br><br>Rei doesn't place much value in piloting the EVA itself, and that's the right approach. There's nothing wrong with passion, but the bigger picture (i.e what you can achieve by piloting) is more important. <br><br>Rei's problem is that she doesn't place too much value in her own life, she's not invested enough in herself and doesn't live a very happy life.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>maybe yes maybe no</br>  This is a Rei.  According to Walter Mischel, the idea of personality doesn't work as no specific traits have been shown to remain consistent across situations. Instead, it is simply the situation that defines how a person acts, and a person will act in ways too inconsistent across various situations for any personality traits to truly exist.<br><br>So personality doesn't exist for Asuka or Rei.</br></br>  <br>This is the worst post in this thread.</br>  <br> These are flaws. <br><br>Ok you win. Rei is flawed, but you have to agree Asuka is more flawed.<br><br> People who like Asuka care <br><br>I like Asuka and I don´t care that she has a college degree. This also just supports why she is so pround of herself.<br><br> than there are early college graduates <br><br>Because that´s what defines Asukas character.<br><br> character that are just as realistic with their stories and development put into context <br><br>Well of course. But the way Rei is portrayed doesn´t resemble real people. At least how I see it. Maybe I´m not paying enough attention to people who do what they are orderen without questioning it, who don´t care if they are groped, who don´t seek social interaction, who don´t have anything they aim for in life. Wait maybe people like that don´t exist except for a few exceptions.<br><br> not a measure of what makes a great character or a great person. <br><br>My whole point is, that Asukas more relateable, since she´s more "realistic". That´s coming from someone who is literally Shinji. And I agree that Rei is a better person than Asuka. But Rei is unrelateable.<br>You can like people for their flaws you know.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Debatable.</br>  <br>Yes, no, maybe, I don't know</br>  <br> Ok you win. Rei is flawed, but you have to agree Asuka is more flawed. <br>Depends on how you rate each flaw.<br><br> I like Asuka and I don´t care that she has a college degree. This also just supports why she is so pround of herself. <br>You aren't every Asuka fan. These superficial moe traits are more important than you think to the fanbase at large. Also, the point is that this superficial bit of "trivia" exists in the series and is canon. Therefore it's a part of the character you cannot ignore.<br><br> Because that´s what defines Asukas character. <br>See above. You can't ignore part of the character, otherwise you're talking about fanfic-asuka.<br><br> Well of course. But the way Rei is portrayed doesn´t resemble real people. At least how I see it. <br>It resembles as real person that has gone through the same stuff Rei has. There are worse examples to be found in real life.<br><br> My whole point is, that Asukas more relateable, since she´s more "realistic". <br>Not really. I don't find Asuka relateable at all. Being relatable doesn't mean you're a good person or a good character either. It's just not important.<br><br> You can like people for their flaws you know. <br>Very rarely, and only if they're "safe" flaws like the ones a cartoon character presents for instance. Hence we can go back to the original point concerning it being immature to like Asuka for her flaws/because she's realistic since ultimately the flaws aren't real and neither are the problems they pose.<br><br>Asuka became more popular when they revamped the entire character to be nothing but moe and tsun tsun, gave her another moe trait accolade (she's now an airforce captain as well as a college graduate). <br>You could probably add in the eyepatch/supergirl moe too.<br><br><br>Not debatable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Very debatable.</br>  <br>Without a question, it can not be debated that  is the worst post in this thread.</br>  <br>Rei</br>  <br><br>Hikari</br></br>  <br>It can be debated.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xzU<wbr>gmeUSOkY</wbr>  [ ]  <br>What a turd of the movie.<br><br>Neo-Asukafags are the worst.</br></br></br>  <br> not posting the best Asuka video <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XBH<wbr>aECF8-qk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Rei isn't really portrayed as a "real person". She shouldn't be portrayed as a real person though. She does have characteristics that people CAN relate to such as being nihilistic to the point of disregard for one's own life. Enjoying seclusion and observing others' lives from the sidelines. Her passiveness due to lack of interest is a feature of hers. It isn't that uncommon for a teenaged girl if she were depressed.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=OKq<wbr>Gw1ODD-E</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>This is the best video.</br></br></br>  <br>wrong<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dKn<wbr>-lk27QaI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Rei reacts, feels and thinks like a real person. She's confined to the same laws the rest of the people in NGE is. For all intents and purposes, she is portrayed as such. Rei isn't normal by any means however. <br>Ironically that makes Rei rather unique for a person who believes she can be replaced.</br></br>  <br>At first I went Rei, but then I started to realize how boring she was.

So what. Peoples minds aren´t free. We aren´t equal and we can´t chose whatever we want because of the way we fundamentally are. NERV may have had a lot of influence on Asukas personality but that doesn´t make her less likeable or a worse character than if NERV didn´t. Asuka is a tragic character, every Eva character is.<br>It´s basicly not her fault that she´s a bad person and that she´s suffering if you say it´s NERVs fault. <br><br> Rei's problem is that she doesn't place too much value in her own life, she's not invested enough in herself and doesn't live a very happy life. <br><br>And that´s the whole problem. That´s not how people act. People only care for themself. But Rei doesn´t.<br><br><br> Therefore it's a part of the character you cannot ignore. <br><br>It´s not the main point of her character you idiot.<br><br> You can't ignore part of the character <br><br>But I can focus on the important things about her right?<br><br> There are worse examples to be found in real life. <br><br>Ok that´s just my point of view.<br><br> Being relatable doesn't mean you're a good person or a good character either. <br>And just being a good person doesn´t make you automaticly likeable.<br><br> the flaws aren't real <br>They are. A lot of girls her age are like that. Only care about themself. Want respect. Want to be treated like an adult. Maybe you are just autistic.<br><br> Asuka became more popular when they revamped the entire character to be nothing but moe and tsun tsun <br>But most people prefer NGE Asuka (and that´s who we are talking about here). Shikanami sucks for the most part. <br><br> I´m gone for the next 4 or so hours so I won´t be able to response sorry.  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying he can do that <br>If it was useful for anything, he'd probably have done it a long time ago.</br></br>  <br>I would more argue that she has traits that real people have, but is also portrayed with a bit of mystery that can't be portrayed as "personhood". In other words, she is both a real person and a not real person depending on the traits people have observed. One of the traits is her coming back from, what for any normal person would be, fatal injuries. When people observe that, she becomes almost something outside of personhood, however when she performs actions such as smiling for Shinji, developing a connection to Gendo, her anger with Shinji, and her mix of anger/annoyance with Asuka, she exudes personhood. To assume Rei's portrayal as a person or non-person is binary is rather foolish and over simplifies the spectrum of personality Rei has.</br>  <br><br>made me lol</br></br>  based  Reisuka    <br> Same goes for Shinji.  <br>No, they brought Shinji aboard in an unscheduled and unplanned manner. <br><br> It´s basicly not her fault that she´s a bad person and that she´s suffering if you say it´s NERVs fault.  <br>Typical. Never is ever Asuka's fault, but everything else you can make up that goes well is to her credit. Sure it's NERV's fault, but Asuka is who she is regardless.<br><br> And that´s the whole problem. That´s not how people act. People only care for themself. But Rei doesn´t. <br>You probably care for some people in your life. Some people would take a bullet for another. It's called compassion. Rei has it. Do you?<br>People don't only care for themselves.<br><br> It´s not the main point of her character you idiot. <br> But I can focus on the important things about her right? <br>It's a point you can't ignore. Even if it was the last point it's every bit as real as everything else about the character. <br><br> And just being a good person doesn´t make you automaticly likeable. <br>True. There's no accounting for taste.<br><br> They are. <br>They literally aren't. They're cartoon flaws. You don't like "someone" for their flaws in the same way you like Asuka for hers, because Asuka's flaws can never harm you unless you fantasize about it. Which is masochism really.<br><br>You like Asuka at best because it's a character that allows you to fantasize about liking a fake person like Asuka because it's "real". It's a strong self-delusion, some sort of feigned bravery.<br><br> But most people prefer NGE Asuka (and that´s who we are talking about here). Shikanami sucks for the most part.  <br>Most people prefer Shikinami. Polls proved it, activity proved it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Asuka.</br>  <br> One of the traits is her coming back from, what for any normal person would be, fatal injuries <br>This is universally true for every single person in Evangelion due to it's ending where everyone is killed and brought back to life. Including the main character, who was also reduced to a liquid and brought back to life.<br><br> When people observe that, she becomes almost something outside of personhood <br>She becomes something more, it is apt to say. What happens to Rei leaves a profound, deep impression as well as her reaction and thoughts about it.<br><br>Given that you explain that she is portrayed with personhood, we must conclude that she is portrayed with personhood, and if there's something beyond that portrayal, then she's something more not something less.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The same thing applies to Asuka twice as much.</br>   Sex with Rei <br>Jerks you off the entire time and catches your cum in a tissue, that she promptly throws out.<br> Sex with Asuka <br>Pretends to be experienced in bed, but really has no idea what she's doing. Will probably start to shake when you whip it out. Normally dominant Asuka turns into a scared little sub.<br> Sex with Shinji <br>Admittedly doesn't know much about sex but is incredibly open to influence. He refuses to say no, his boundaries are as endless as you want them to be.<br> Sex with Kaworu <br>Startlingly foreign. You've likely never felt sensations like the ones Kaworu provides. This, however, is offset by the fact that it's still gay as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  ITT: Buttmad Reifags.  <br>I think more than person hood a poor way to describe since the traits she also shows with being Lilith don't add to her personhood so to say. I think it would be more applicable to say outside of personhood. Since it is something distinctly not human or like a person. It does add to her character as a whole, but not necessarily her "human" side. I am being very semantic about this, but I think it is important when it comes to a character as intricate and subtle as Rei.</br>  <br> sex with any of those "people" <br>you get a papercut on your dick because they're 2d and not real</br></br>    <br>You would be mad after you though you were going to win only to be trolled to shit.</br>  <br>That's what you get when you're a huge faggot who places all of your hopes on shipping.</br>  <br>How mad would /a/ be if final was a homo end? Or even a Mari end?</br>  <br>Normalfag pls go</br>  <br>You forgot sex with Misato.<br> Sex with Misato <br>Starts off as great drunken sex where she is enthusiastic, but slowly breaks down into tears when she realizes you aren't Kaji and that you can't bring daddy or Kaji back. Will then proceed to be emotionally vulnerable and will do whatever you say despite the risk.<br> She'd probably have you cum inside without protection in hopes of filling the void she fills with a kid </br></br></br></br>  <br>Hilarious</br>  <br>Isnt Misato canonically sterile from being too close to 2nd Impact?</br>    <br>Personhood isn't reserved for humans only.</br>  <br>where did you get that from</br>  <br><br><br><br>Here comes the Asukafag Autist to ruin the thread.<br><br>Oh well, it's all downhill from here.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>spam or spammer?</br>  <br> dat paranoia <br><br>Reifags everyone.</br></br></br>  <br>Better than butthurt Reifag hugbox.</br>   http://exhentai.org/g/837223/40030<wbr>67ba8/</wbr>   <br> asuka <br> big breasts <br>what</br></br></br>  <br>How mad do you have to be to do that?</br>  <br>This mad.</br>  The one with a personality.  <br>Everything looks bigger from Asian perspective.</br>    <br>Not the guy you started this with, but whatever.<br><br> No, they brought Shinji aboard in an unscheduled and unplanned manner.  <br>The timing of when the angels would arrive was unscheduled. They didn't know exactly when they would need Shinji, but Yui was in the core of Unit 01 since Shinji was a young child. It was definitely planned that they would use Shinji. How much influence NERV had in shaping Shinji's avoidant personality idk.<br><br> Never is ever Asuka's fault, but everything else you can make up that goes well is to her credit. <br>I think the previous poster would agree with you. Even though NERV is responsible for the situation, Asuka is responsible for how she deals with it.<br><br> It's a point you can't ignore. <br>I think it's there, but it's an unimportant detail in the context of her character.<br><br> They literally aren't. They're cartoon flaws. <br>I agree that her flaws can seem exaggerated. I think she is an extreme case of someone with histrionic personality disorder, which I've seen elements of in people I know. Here's an analysis of that disorder as it applies to Asuka.<br><br> inb4 tumblr <br>http://ritsumaya.tumblr.com/post/88<wbr>279631797/eva-analysis-asuka-langle<wbr>y-sohryuu<br><br> You don't like "someone" for their flaws in the same way you like Asuka for hers, because Asuka's flaws can never harm you unless you fantasize about it. <br>I think there is a difference between liking a character and feeling pity and empathy. I can't speak for all fans, but I have an attachment to Asuka because I want to help her. I associate strongly with Shinji and realize that Shinji and Asuka are dealing with very similar issues. In real life it would be difficult for me to get close to an Asuka-like person, but if I knew that we were suffering with the same issues I would want to help. <br><br> Most prefer Shikinami. <br>I think the people who prefer Shikinami also probably didn't like the psychological parts of NGE or they're looking for some kind of wish fulfillment scenario. I'm not sure about that though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thermal expansion, obviously</br>  How do people non-ironically choose Rei over Asuka? Asuka may be a bitch but Rei literally has no emotions. Why choose a 0/10 over a 1/10?  <br> It was definitely planned that they would use Shinji. <br>It wasn't. Hence there are no real preparations done whatsoever from the science team. Ritsuko is certain it won't work.<br><br>Had they planned to use Shinji, they'd give him training like they did with Asuka.<br><br> I think it's there, but it's an unimportant detail in the context of her character. <br>It's not unimportant because you say it is, it makes part of the character's context. It can't be removed or looked away from. Either accept it as it is, or don't accept the character.<br><br> tumblr <br>not relevant<br><br> I can't speak for all fans, but I have an attachment to Asuka because I want to help her. <br>Which would make you a shitty person, since every child character deserves help, some need it more as well. Prioritizing like this, and arguably wrongly, makes you sort of shitty.<br><br> I think the people who prefer Shikinami also probably didn't like the psychological parts of NGE or they're looking for some kind of wish fulfillment scenario. I'm not sure about that though. <br>All Asukafags do, because Asuka is the closest thing to wish-fulfillment in NGE and always has been. You revealed yourself by saying you wanted to help Asuka (help a cartoon?), which means this Shikinami is your wish-fulfillment as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Daily reminder  <br>Rei is literally goddess-tier<br>Asuka is just a whiny little bitch</br></br>  <br>Because I saw a lot of myself in Rei while watching the series and don't see her as having no emotions, just being horribly repressed.</br>  <br>Are you a mother clone too?</br>  <br>No, she has no emotions.

I'm not sure what NERV's motive would be in not training Shinji.<br><br> Either accept it as it is, or don't accept the character. <br>Yeah, I do accept it and acknowledge it, but it doesn't give much meaning to her character.<br><br> not relevant <br>I think the tumblr post I mentioned is relevant. Why would you say it isn't?<br><br> Which would make you a shitty person, since every child character deserves help, some need it more as well. <br>Just because I want to help Asuka doesn't mean that I don't want to help the other characters. It's just that I understand what she's going through, and thus I would be able to help her better than Rei, for example. It would be difficult for me to get through to Rei. I still want to help all the characters though. <br><br> Prioritizing like this, and arguably wrongly, makes you sort of shitty. <br>Sorry I want to help people I think I can help.<br><br> All Asukafags do. <br>Then I'm not an Asukafag.<br><br> You revealed yourself by saying you wanted to help Asuka (help a cartoon?) <br>I can't literally "help a cartoon," that's impossible, but I can still feel sympathetic to a cartoon representing aspects of real people.<br><br> Shikinami is your wish-fulfillment as well <br>Soryu, perhaps.

I don't remember the date.<br><br>This is why Shinji isn't the same case as Asuka, because he isn't trained since birth. Rei on the other hand is more comparable to Asuka.<br><br> OK. Maybe it's important to other fans, but it doesn't color my perception of her to any noticeable degree. <br>Not any degree you'd be willing to admit anyhow. Moe traits are extremely important. Not just for Asuka fans, but for all fans.<br><br> I think it shows how Asuka is a realistic and relatable character, which is relevant. <br>Its not relevant because we don't need the analysis to established what has already been established in this thread.<br><br>Moreover, the same analysis of other characters by that same user is also showcasing Rei among others as relatable, realistic characters. Remember, just because you can't relate doesn't mean others don't. I don't relate to Asuka, at all, for instance.<br><br> I'm not prioritizing who I would prefer to help. I'm not saying I need to help her over any other character, just that, hypothetically if she was real, I could help her easier than others because of my life experiences. I don't think she deserves more or less care than any other characters. <br><br>It's too late to backtrack now. Besides, I don't think you're right either. I think even you would have an easier time helping Shinji or Rei. What they need is some good old fashioned warmth and approval. Real kindness. Asuka can get that and all the attention she wants, but is mostly unfazed still.<br><br>The cure for Rei and Shinji's problems are good old fashioned nurturing, moreso in Rei's case. Showcases of genuine kindness and having a real talk will do far more than any therapy or drug can.<br><br>I don't think you've considered the others.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Compelling argument.</br>  Finished rewatching 2.22. <br><br>The preview for 3.33 literally has nothing to do with the actually movie. So I guess there is still hope that 3.0 + 1.0 may actually not be a CG infested Mech fighter like the 3.33 preview shows.<br><br>One can only hope.</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw 3.33 ruined Rebuild </br>  <br>1.11 ruined Rebuild.</br>  <br> mfw <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=fb0<wbr>-kgfQZVY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>No shit the preview had nothing to do with what actually happened in 3.33, they skipped at least a whole movie's worth of stuff, potentially 2 or 3, all to give us Gay Pianos instead of anything resembling character development or...anything other than 'new stuff we can sell' and 'gay pianos'</br>  <br> Rebuild <br> good </br></br>  <br>Not this shit again.<br><br>Yes the first two were good. No the third was not good.<br><br>Rebuild Characters &gt; Original Characters<br><br>Asuka was actually not a bitch in the Rebuilds. Rei was actually likeable in 2.22.<br>Shinji actually mans up in the end of both movies.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The first two were decent. Unlike this guy: <br>I think the original characters are way better.</br></br>  Asuka is best girl.<br><br> But only after instrumentality where she can't bullshit herself. </br></br>  <br> there are people who unironically believe this </br>  <br>More than you think actually.</br>  <br>I liked Rebuild up until the point where Yui didn't go batshit on Zeruel and instead Shinji decided to screw over everyone else.<br>01 tearing Zeruel apart was one of the strongest scenes for me in the original series, and everything after that not happening was just....bleh.</br></br>  <br>You do realize that only borderline mentally incompetent, legitimately autistic people like Rei? She has literally no personality and any mentally healthy human being would find her creepy. Who on earth could actually be attracted to her? Are you so socially anxious that you can only imagine a relationship with someone who can barely socialize? Are you a sociopath who wants to control someone with no will of their own? People who prefer Rei to Asuka need to be put in mental institutions.</br>  <br>The butthurt would be glorious.<br><br>Also best girl pictured.</br></br></br>  Shikinami&gt;Sohryu<br>But Rei it is.</br>  Why do people say you have to be a masochist to like Asuka?  Posting best girl  Asuka, ya fucking dweebs<br><br>also, check em</br></br>  <br> Anno: Sadists, without question, go to Rei, because of their sadistic desires. I believe that masochists go to Asuka. And, there is a tendency for women of the same generation and people who are children mentally to go to Misato. </br>  <br> This is why Shinji isn't the same case as Asuka, because he isn't trained since birth. Rei on the other hand is more comparable to Asuka. <br>I'd agree that Rei is more like Asuka in that regard. I think it's about NERV, and Gendo specifically, affecting Shinji's personality. Whether this was intended or not, I'm not sure, but he <br><br> Remember, just because you can't relate doesn't mean others don't. <br>I can relate to Rei, Misato, etc, just not to the extent I can for Shinji and Asuka. I never said Rei was unrelatable nor unrealistic.<br><br> It's too late to backtrack now. <br>How am I backtracking? You know I'm not the same guy as the original person you started this with, right?<br><br>I want to help all of the characters, but believe that I could help Asuka more than Rei.<br><br>I think I would have an easier time helping Shinji, yes. I don't feel like I fully understand Rei's desires and motivations, which is why it would be harder to help her. She seems distant to me. It's hard for me to get a read on her. Maybe all she wants is to be loved, to feel as though she is an individual worth caring about. I'm not certain about this though, which is why I don't know how/if I can help her. <br><br>Asuka needs constant validation from others that she is worth something. I feel like I know her motivations, which allows me to act on them. <br><br>Rei is more of a mystery to me, which makes me less confident in dealing with her. I know what it's like to feel like your life is worthless. Rei is selfless to the extent that she has no self because of this. I think that is admirable, but I don't know how to deal with someone like that. I wish I could help her, but I don't know how.<br><br>I think you would be correct if I didn't have an insight into Asuka's mind though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That sounds like a really artificial opinion. The equivalent scene in 2.0 is extremely powerful, and Evangelion isn't about Yui tearing up Zeruel, it's about characters.</br>  <br> artificial opinion <br>Man these threads are shit.</br></br>  <br>It doesn't seem like you've given all the characters equal amount of attention. Not given it enough thought.<br><br>It's easy once you try.</br></br></br>  <br>You forgot it made some more depressed than when their grandpa died.</br>    <br>Read to the end of the image.</br>  <br>Shit. I missed old Reiheart at the bottom.</br>  <br>Some times people feel something about something. They have an opinion.<br><br>But, when they know that opinion is shallow or otherwise to their own detriment, (that is by expressing it they appear like an idiot) they often seek out an alternative opinion or roundabout concept that enforces their original opinion without explicitly mentioning it.<br><br>It's easy to spot most of the time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Guess that's makes this whole thread artificial, then.</br>  <br>What's wrong with that? If you think something is true, you should find a reason to justify that opinion, no?</br>  <br>Case in point, your post.</br>  <br> artificial response </br>  <br>I have not yet read the manga which I hear gives more insight into Rei. But I think I've gotten almost all that I can from the show.<br><br>Perhaps I don't give characters equal attention because the show doesn't give characters equal attention.</br></br></br>  <br> But I think I've gotten almost all that I can from the show. <br>You clearly haven't. You're just a passive observer.</br></br>  <br>Why does he always look so unimpressed with Asuka's everything?</br>  <br>Because he's a bisexual with preference to males, apparently. Fucking shitter.</br>  <br>He is suppressing his rape urges</br>  <br>OK, well assuming I want to get more from the show, how could I do so? I've seen it many times. <br><br> passive observer <br>I'm not sure what the alternative to this you're implying is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because he wants to fuck his mom.</br>  <br>Not what I'm talking about. It doesn't justify the opinion, it's another opinion or argument entirely that coincidentally gets you somewhere close to where your actual opinion wants to go.<br><br>Let's say you didn't like a person due to a detail about their face, or you're jealous of a promotion the person got. You feel this strongly, but saying it as it is would make you appear shallow or weird.<br><br>So, you contrive something else concerning the person, about what they've done, some discriminating detail or criticize their behavior. It gets you in a similar position, the person in question demonized, reflecting your original opinion without stating it. <br><br>Criticizing what is by all means a minor part of the original as well as the Rebuild series seems like a cover for something else, because it's too small a thing to get worked up about. Instead it's actually more likely if the person in question is a shipper who felt threatened and jealous, so therefore one can make up another narrative to attack the movie.<br><br>Because who would come out right and say "I'm a shipper, and I didn't like the movie for shipping reasons" if they wanted to be taken seriously?<br><br><br><br>Not the same thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The fuck? Is Shinji's right leg broken or something?</br>  <br> tfw caspar betrays you </br>  <br> Artificial wall of text </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128727731 <br>I bet if you had a life you wouldn't constantly repost this picture.</br>  <br> if the person in question is a shipper who felt threatened and jealous, so therefore one can make up another narrative to attack the movie. </br>  <br><br><br><br>His right leg is fine. It's his left that's fucked.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Perhaps instead of shipping, he was disappointed by the lack of the dark, brooding, horrifying tone set by NGE. Your entire argument is basically "He disagrees with me? He must be a shipfag!"</br>  <br> "I'm a shipper, and I didn't like the movie for shipping reasons" <br>Why would a shipper be mad about 2.0?<br>Shinji showed no romantic interest in Rei whatsoever, just like in NGE.<br>It's so blatantly a platonic sibling relationship that suggesting otherwise makes you the shipper.</br></br></br></br>  So, /a/, how fast can you make Shinji depressed?<br>http://www.hyco.me/sad-shinji/<br>You can also up the difficulty by clicking the Mode: icon at the top right of the board to get Rei and Asuka.</br></br>  REBUILD 4.0 POST CREDITS SCENE<br> Shinji wakes up back in his room at Misato's apartment <br> Same whitewashed 90s animation style as the original series <br> He looks up at the unfamiliar ceiling and wonders about what a crazy dream he just had <br> Mari pulls herself out from under the covers and demands that Shinji fuck her again. <br> FIN </br></br></br></br></br>  So, Robin Williams was a Rei or a Asukafag?<br><br> I have the impression that the second, because of the way he died.</br></br>      <br>Is this bait?</br>   &gt;moot left six months ago   <br><br> Re-take <br>Go fuck yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>Reifag definitely. A cool one, doe.</br>  <br>I can't really blame Robin. I would've killed myself too if I were a Reifag.</br>  <br>Said atmosphere isn't there after Asuka is introduced. 2.0 is the movie where Asuka is introduced, hence there being a dark brooding atmosphere is out of place.<br>That's why it sounds artificial. Someone who genuinely cared about the dark and brooding atmosphere would also understand that such an atmosphere can only exist proper if there's some good contrast - something 2.0 and the equivalent part in NGE provides.<br><br><br>A lot of people disagree, people feel threatened and upset by virtually nothing.</br></br></br></br></br>    So Robin Williams is a famous Reifag<br>Moot is a famous Asukafag<br>Anno is a famous Kaworufag<br>Who is a famous Misatofag or Shinjifag?</br></br></br>  <br>It's a legitimate question.<br>You always say here that he was a Reifag, but I never understood why.<br><br><br>I think Asukafags are more prone to depression.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Michael Bay.</br>  <br>You'd be surprised.</br>  <br>Tom Cruise</br>  <br>Adam Sandler</br>  <br>Quite a few Reifags beg to differ.</br>  <br>But I don't ship anyone with anyone.<br>That scene, more than anything, stood out to me - not just the Eva's actions themselves, but everyone's reactions to it. Whenever I think of Eva, that scene is one of the first things that I think of, every time.</br></br>  <br>There was some serious reactions to what happened in 2.0 as well.<br><br> Whenever I think of Eva, that scene is one of the first things that I think of, every time. <br>Then you have a really, really limited scope as to what Eva is and can be.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What would an Adam Sandler adaptation of NGE in the vein of Pixels look like?</br>  <br>Shit.</br>  <br> Why would a shipper be mad about 2.0? <br>Back during the 2.0 days Asuka fans especially were extremely angry that Shinji showed interest in Rei, while Asuka was quarantined.<br>Asuka is the most shipped female character in all of Evangelion, and still has that status today.<br><br>They're so prolific that this image: <br>which was made by an Asukafan to prove the evidence of shipping amongst Rei fans is actually consisting of a big number of Asuka fans complaining passive-aggressively or dismissively about what they consider Rei shipping. (Sadamoto is a reifag, it's shinji/rei because that's what otaku want, or general butthurt.)<br><br>Check them out in the archive to get the context.<br><br>The asuka fans on this board are really, really delusional concerning the issue.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rob Schneider would be Asuka.</br>  <br>Elaborate, because every Adam Sandler movie is shit; it's kind of a given when I asked the question.</br>  <br>There would be CGI and terrible acting and no jokes and the story would be wrong.<br><br>You already know the answer.</br></br></br>  <br>Reign Over Me was a good movie.<br>Mr. Deeds too.</br></br>  <br> really, really delusional concerning the issue. <br>What issue?</br></br>  <br> Everything is Asukafags fault <br> Asukafags are the delusional ones <br>Classic Reifag</br></br></br>  <br>Who would Kevin Smith be? Kaworu?</br>  <br>No that'd be Kevin James.</br>  <br>Pen Pen.</br>  <br>see <br><br>too much blame-game. I can say what I said and be honest, because the origins of that image can also be checked in the archive and we can tell. You can also surmise that you'd have to be delusional to think that a Rei fan would post something that derides 2.0 for siring a "bunch of incest Rei x Shinji faggots" and calling spinoffs crappy since the poster it thinks it features rei and shinji. <br><br>That's why I say they have to be really really delusional or at least bold to try and bluff like that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh you are just babbling about fanbase wars <br><br>Nobody actually cares</br></br></br>  <br>Shit, that's what I meant to ask.</br>  <br> Asuka is the most shipped female character in all of Evangelion, and still has that status today. <br>Because besides Rei, she's the only other female main character that's young enough for the otaku to care about.<br>Rei doesn't get shipped nearly as much because there's no evidence or basis for her ship whatsoever. That's just common sense.</br></br></br>  <br>Manga shipping was pretty strong until Sadamoto decided to shit on Rei</br>  <br>He does this every thread, just ignore him or spam Rei x Gendo art to keep him at bay.<br>He'll off himself eventually.</br></br>  <br>No, it actually wasn't. Only delusional Reifags think so. <br>Shinji makes it clear very early on he has no romantic interest in Rei in the manga, he only shows romantic interest in one person same with the Anime.</br></br>  <br>Eh, I doubt that. Even if you or I don't, see <br>as well as <br><br><br><br><br><br>and so on. It's very much alive, even the blame game. This very thread, which is literally a waifu war magnet gets more replies than any other honestly made evangelion thread that isn't complaining about how shitty the series was.<br><br>Besides I was talking about the movie, not this. I wouldn't have elaborated if you didn't ask.<br><br><br>Shippers don't really need basis or evidence, there's a golden midway. Kaji and Misato get relatively very little attention as do other couples that are more or less proven in the series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really miss the times when people could handle a little banter and wouldn't break out into autistic whining</br>  <br> Kaji and Misato get relatively very little attention as do other couples that are more or less proven in the series. <br>Because as I said, they aren't young enough and therefore aren't as attracting or appealing to the audience. <br>Sure, there will be fans out there who crackship and pair two characters who never even talk to eachother, but the most popular and widespread supported pairings are almost always the ones with the most evidence and basis; hence why certain pairings in the Eva fanbase are more popular than others (like ReixShinji).</br></br></br>  <br>Kaworu?</br>  <br>Shh, you're not supposed to say that name here. Didn't you get the memo?</br>  <br>But he didnt showed romantic interest in Kaworu in the manga.</br>  Reminder that Rei is a clone<br>Reminder that Rei is actually a weird ass alien in human form<br>Reminder that an Asuka/Shinji relationship makes more sense<br>Reminder that we're all pathetic losers for arguing over this</br></br></br>  <br>I don't really remember such a time. Pop back to a thread as far back as the archive goes and you'll see people complaining about asuka fans even then.<br>Mentioning Re-Take isn't as taboo as it is now either.<br><br><br>Misato is far more frequently shown with Shinji, not Kaji. So it's not entirely true, although younger is usually more popular. <br>It has to do with character types more than it has to do with evidence or basis, which is why crackshipping is also rampant in Evangelion, consider Asuka and Kaworu. <br><br>Again, the couples that are established are inherently less interesting than unestablished ones because the latter leaves room for imagination. This is why there is only teasing in Evangelion or multiple ends.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And Robin Williams was an Asukafag.</br>  <br>Did you actually read the manga or what?</br>  "Suka" means "bitch" in my language.<br><br>I'd still want to fuck the redhead, even though I find Rei's body hotter. Get a feeling so complicated.</br></br>  <br>Yes he did:<br> In fact, Shinji and Rei, and Shinji and Asuka, their touch stopped at holding hands. Everytime they hold their hands, it has a different meaning. It is one fun fact about EVA……So I never intend to let the children’s relationship go beyond that. On the contrary, Kaworu is the only one who overstep the boundary, he break the rule. </br></br>  <br>Even Sadamoto started to go gay for Kaworu.</br>  <br> I don't really remember such a time <br>Of course you don't you've been here for 3 weeks</br></br>  <br>Name one sweaty Japanese man at Khara who isn't gay for Kaworu.<br>Protip: You can't.</br></br>  <br>He just cashed in on the Fujo's, the Kaworu volumes were the best selling volumes of the manga</br>  <br>Tsurumaki</br>  <br>Most likely, I've been here longer than anyone in this thread. Yes, that's embarrassing.</br>  <br>Likewise, the Kaworu themed pachinko sold ten times more than the other Eva pachinkos.<br>He's Khara's money maker.</br></br>  <br> I've been here longer than anyone in this thread. <br>Yeah no, this archive obsession and attacking the fanbases (not the characters) is fucking 3 weeks old</br></br>  <br><br>Because Fujo's only pick it up when Kaworu is there. So there's regular evafags + fujos as opposed to just evafags.<br><br>They don't really care about the rest. They're not here for the story, but for the intensive shipping spree.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Pop back to a thread as far back as the archive goes and you'll see people complaining about asuka fans even then <br>Yes, there was a lot of Reifags pretending they were perfect and blaming every single thing wrong with the threads on Asukafags.<br><br> Mentioning Re-Take isn't as taboo as it is now either. <br>It goes in loops. For some reason, idiots start thinking it's good and start talking about it favorably every now and again before getting shot down soon enough.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That has been here as long as I can remember, except the archives which didn't come until years later. If you think attacking fanbases or characters is new, then you're born yesterday.</br>  <br> attacking the fanbases (not the characters) is fucking 3 weeks old <br>Not sticking up for that guy either since he's an autist, but yeah that's not true.</br></br>  <br>Easy the best girl.</br>  <br>It's not always Reifags anon, although I'm sure much of the time it is. Who else has the motive since asukafags torment them so much?</br>  <br>Tsurumaki is fond of Kaworu, but maybe not to I want to fuck him levels like the other faggots at Khara are.</br>  <br><br>I'm going to sit here and be a Shinjifag and the rest of you fags can't stop me.</br></br>  <br>Nah, he doesn't give a fuck about Kaworu <br><br>Because he is actually a talented director and know how garbage the character really is</br></br></br>  <br>More like fujos are the only ones who have money.<br>All other Evafags are just waifufag Otaku who leech off of their parents in their basements.</br></br>  <br>Good thing I said "a lot" and not "all." Yes, other people shitpost, but that street goes both ways. It's just as obnoxious to hear Reifags constantly pin the blame on everyone else while pretending they're free of blame.</br>  <br> Yes, there was a lot of Reifags pretending they were perfect and blaming every single thing wrong with the threads on Asukafags. <br>I doubt it was only Reifags, and in those people's defense then a lot of noise could be avoided if they toned down their zeal a little, but this goes both ways.<br><br> It goes in loops. For some reason, idiots start thinking it's good and start talking about it favorably every now and again before getting shot down soon enough. <br>The trend is still going downwards, but it could be because it's old.<br><br><br>I'm not autistic, I just give it a little more thought than the average thread participant does. Which is none, by the way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fujos are a cancerous growth on the entire franchise obsessing over a non-character that was in the show for 20 minutes</br>  <br>That's pretty incorrect.<br>Tsurumaki draws Kaworu frequently, and even shoved him into the Beautiful World music video despite him not really belonging there:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=uuM<wbr>NmHdr0Lg</wbr>  [ ]<br>Then there's also those statements he made about him in the 2.0 CRC.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm not autistic <br>You are, but you will be gone from these threads in a month or two when you become bored or school starts again</br></br>  <br>You sound like a butthurt fujo. If they had that much more money, then they sure didn't buy into the regular evangelion story, but bided their time until the kaworu chapters came.<br><br>Not out to start a fanbase war here, but fujo and kaworu go together hand in hand. You don't read Kaworu's sections for the story or depth, and the manga is one of the better ones.</br></br></br>  <br> Then there's also those statements he made about him in the 2.0 CRC. <br>What statements?</br></br>  <br>And yet they're the ones actually doing what Anno wants them to by having lives, friends and getting jobs with money and whatnot.<br>Otaku are doing nothing but jacking off to Asuka and Rei as per usual, ignoring Eva's message.<br>No wonder why Anno is pandering to certain fanbases over others.</br></br></br>  <br>Not quite sure what I've said to upset you, but I'm sure you're just an Asuka fan being noisy like usual. I'll pay you no mind.<br><br><br>I don't see why Kaworu wouldn't belong there considering he's been a participant in every Rebuild movie so far.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes their standards are incredibly low and they just buy-up feelgood garbage like Kaworu <br><br>Like typical normalfags</br></br></br>  <br> to upset you <br>Just stating facts, been here long enough to see dozens of agenda pushing retards like you wash through these threads</br></br>  <br>Back then they had the benefit of the Rei trip, which because it was an open trip, allowed them to either say the people using it were proper, good Reifags if they said something good, or either Asukafags trying to stir trouble or otherwise unrelated shitposters if they were doing something they disagreed with. The main problem at the time was that Reifags - and yes it was Reifags making this argument - cclaimed that Asukafags were responsible for all of the terrible things in the threads, and that they were perfect. Certainly there were Reifags who didn't agree with that kind of stupidity, but there was the constant dynamic of Reifags claiming superiority over everyone else.<br><br> a lot of noise could be avoided if they toned down their zeal a little, but this goes both ways. <br>That goes so much more for how things are today than now, for everyone involved in these threads. Everyone is hypersensitive and everything is just godawful.<br><br> The trend is still going downwards <br>Think of it like a pendulum. We're at a good spot right now where everyone rightfully hates it. Eventually someone will show up and start saying it's good, and he might get some supporters. It'll be our job to shoot them down properly when that time comes, then wait for the next swing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Strange to imply that male otaku don't. As far as I can remember Japanese men are far more employed than Japanese women, and earn a lot more.<br>When it comes to settling down and starting a family, well... it takes two to tango, doesn't it?<br><br>Regardless pandering is bad no matter who it's aimed at.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Tsurumaki: Kaworu’s line stayed the same from the very first storyboard. It was something he said while wearing his usual relaxed smile. Of course, at the last minute, just, I think, before we started postsynchronization, we began talking about whether or not it would be better if Kaworu looked scary during that scene.  <br><br> Interviewer: As a result, it looks like he’s come to take his bride by force! <br> Tsurumaki: Right, right (laughing). [We thought it would be] more interesting if Kaworu looked like [he was thinking]: “You’ve been with a woman while I’ve been away? How dare you…!” It’s not Kaworu’s usual relaxed expression; he’s somehow become irritated, right? <br> –Kazuya Tsurumaki, Evangelion 2.0 Complete Records Collection (Director of Neon Genesis Evangelion &amp; Rebuild of Evangelion) </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would they waste money on parts that don't include their favorite character?<br>That's like expecting an Asukafag to buy a Rei figure.</br></br>  <br>And how does that imply anything other then him not giving a shit? <br><br>If anything it's making fun of the fact that his character is that one-dimensional</br></br></br>  <br>We are not talking about chara figures we are talking about a manga that doesn't make sense if you start reading from the middle</br>  It just hit me that comparing Asuka to Rei is like comparing Groudon to Kyogre.  <br> he's been a participant in every Rebuild movie so far <br>The fact that Tsurumaki decided to put his 3.0 scenes in the music video for 2.0 where he shows up for 2 seconds suggests he is fond of him.<br><br><br>And yet it's because they are normalfags as opposed to the waifufags that they have earned Anno's favor. Ironically, they're the ones who understood and got Eva's message since they're the ones following it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> chronic depression <br> uses comedy as a way of reaching highs, alternates betweens lows and highs because of it <br>I'd say Asuka since she goes from the highs of "i'm a fucking eva pilot holy fuck i'm awesome didya see that shinji" to suicidal lows. That huge swing of emotion just makes me think chronic depression; Robin was a funny motherfucker yet he was depressed as hell, he'd be hitting highs and lows over and over.<br><br>Although this assumes he'd pick a waifu based on identification.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that male otaku don't <br>Because they don't.<br>Did you even see EoE? That's who Anno has beef with, not fujos.</br></br></br>  <br>It happens. Believe it or not, Asuka and Rei fans aren't as extremely opposed as you'd think. A fledgling Asukafan or Reifan is likely to like both, views only get toxic when intermixed with a community like this one. I can't speak for anyone of course, but when there's an idea presented that you have to choose, as this thread does, then you have the ball rolling.<br><br>Remember that both Rei and Asuka were written by the same people. They are both good characters in their own right, but people's opinions divide once popularity comes in. Jealousy sets in, and now the results have to be proven wrong somehow, and that's easiest done by attacking the opposing team.<br><br>Even Anno is guilty of this.<br><br>Fujos on the other hand, only watches the parts they're interested in. I guarantee you that most evangelion fans started from the first chapter, episode or movie.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that they have earned Anno's favor. <br>They earned his favour because they are easily pleased retards that would buy up any garbage with Kaworu plastered over it. <br><br>3.0 is what a Kaworu movie looks like, and it's insulting trash</br></br></br></br>  <br>Concerning your point on hypersensitivity, I think it applies to you. Otherwise this narrative where Reifags claim they're perfect has no room since that's just not true. The bat swings both ways and in every era of the fandom the more aggressive fandom has been the asuka fanbase, especially on /a/ since the orbiting comnmunities have treated it like a waste basket for the opinions that don't fit in moderated communities.<br><br>The Rei trip was a long time ago and doesn't exactly pose any benefits, as it's just another one of /a/'s many fads that have come and gone. <br><br><br> The fact that Tsurumaki decided to put his 3.0 scenes in the music video for 2.0 where he shows up for 2 seconds suggests he is fond of him. <br>If I remember correctly, the only one from 2.0 in that movie is Rei. With an unofficial picture to boot.<br><br>I don't see the suggestion but I'm not saying he isn't fond. The Evangelion writers are extremely biased.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The proper approach is to hate the Reifag/Asukafag, not Rei or Asuka themselves. They didn't do anything wrong, the fanbase just fucked everything up for them.</br>  <br>The fact that he brings him up out of nowhere suggests he does give a shit.<br>As I said, I don't think he loves him to the degree that the other Khara fags do; but he is fond of him.<br>See  and <br>Forcing him into the music video proves it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You do realize the manga is released in Shounen Ace months before the volumes, right?<br>For all you know they could've read up on it in the magazines and then bought the volumes that showcase their favorite parts.</br></br>  <br> The fact that he brings him up out of nowhere <br>He is talking about a scene in the movie, Jesus you are dumb <br><br> Forcing him into the music video proves it. <br>No it doesn't Kaworu was in 1.0 <br><br>You won't find any evidence of Tsurumaki sperging over Kaworu like Anno or Sadamoto do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it "just because", or is there anything real behind that? Last I checked, girls and women are people as well, and they get lonely, distraught and sad. They're people as much as anyone else and End of Evangelion applies to everyone with it's message.<br><br>The main character is male so I'm sure more men will feel stricken by seeing Shinji jerk off, though. The main character was originally supposed to be a female.<br><br>But my point is that pandering like 3.33 or in general is just universally bad. You're leaving out every single person that loves Evangelion as a whole, even if they have favorites. Judging from the reaction to pandering movies like Q, that's quite a lot of people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for the wallpaper, anon</br>  <br> Reifags claim they're perfect has no room since that's just not true. <br>There was thread after thread years ago with Reifags blaming Asukafags for literally all of the shitposting available. That is a thing that happened no matter how much you say it's not.<br><br>I'm sitting here saying that everyone is at fault and does stupid shit and you're the one pointing the finger. It's an undeniable fact that Reifags were claiming superiority years ago like I described. It's also an undeniable fact that Asukafags have been obnoxious with their superiority claim and constantly harping on Moot and other stupid shit. Both are retarded.<br><br>  it's just another one of /a/'s many fads that have come and gone.  <br>Yes, but it's a thing they used as a convenient excuse back in the day. Ultimately it's unnecessary because you can do the same thing when everyone's anonymous, but that doesn't mean they didn't use it all the same.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hence why I said Asukafag, not Asuka fan. <br>There's a clear difference here.<br><br><br> they are easily pleased retards that would buy up any garbage with Kaworu plastered over it.  <br>The same goes for Reifags, do I need to bring up the Rei poop snacks, Rei guitar, Rei buckets, and Rei shoes for you?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The same goes for Reifags <br>Rei is an infinitely more complex and interesting character, you actually have to watch NGE to like her <br><br>Fujo's can just watch 20 minutes of their non-character being dreamy and non-threatening</br></br></br></br>  <br> If I remember correctly, the only one from 2.0 in that movie is Rei. With an unofficial picture to boot. <br>Watch it again. The Asuka, Misato and Shinji scenes are mostly from 2.0.<br><br><br> He is talking about a scene in the movie <br>Which he brings up in the first place.<br>If he didn't give a shit, why would he bring it up?<br><br> No it doesn't Kaworu was in 1.0  <br>It's a music video for 1.0/2.0, in which Kaworu shows up 5 minutes tops. Not only does it showcase Kaworu from 3.0, but he has way more presence in the video than he did in those actual movies. For Tsurumaki to choose to do that would not suggest he doesn't give a shit about him as you originally claimed.<br><br> You won't find any evidence of Tsurumaki sperging over Kaworu like Anno or Sadamoto do. <br>I never said he did, from the very beginning I said he's fond of him, not to the extent of the other Khara fags who take it ten times more intense.<br>I only am showing you you're wrong in suggesting he doesn't give a shit about Kaworu. He likes him enough to include him drawn in pictures on merchandise that isn't even directed towards fujos like the GoS cover I posted.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Like you said, Rei and Asuka don't exist so people can only express their hatred through the fans, either by dismissing them directly or indirectly attacking them through attacking what they like.<br><br>Anno does it, people on /a/ do it, some even mimic Anno.<br><br><br> There's a clear difference here. <br>Hardly.<br><br>also not that poster but<br> The same goes for Reifags, do I need to bring up the Rei poop snacks, Rei guitar, Rei buckets, and Rei shoes for you? <br>now you're being quite unfair, seeing as every other item there except the guitar (which sold for 100k USD each) is also an item that exists for other characters.<br><br>I think what he wants to get at is that Kaworu fans require little maintenance, and their loyalty as consumers is ensured even if Anno decides to metaphorically rape everything else that isn't Kaworu and Kaworu x Shinji.<br><br>3.0 destroyed the world, whacked Shinji with the depression stick so hard that any point you can derive from him improving is now forfeit, and went nearly all-in to disable Rei as a character while leaving the rest as plot devices and fanservice.<br><br>Yet it's the big movie they get behind...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But my point is that pandering like 3.33 or in general is just universally bad <br>So your point is something completely irrelevant to the topic at hand and something I never once tried to prove otherwise? Um, okay?<br>All I said was that since fujos are normalfags, they're doing what Anno wants, they're following the message of Eva.<br>The obsessive otaku waifufags aren't, and those are the people Anno is angry at; so he punishes them.</br></br></br></br>  Why not both?  <br> Which he brings up in the first place. <br>Because you are being interviewed about the fucking movie? <br><br> I said he's fond of him <br>Being fond would mean he cares about him, he doesn't. At beast he is neutral towards him. You will never find Tsurumaki saying anything close to "I like Kaworu as a character."</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Rei is an infinitely more complex and interesting character <br>So then why is it that figures of Rei smiling with cat eats all genki-like and completely out of character sell like hotcakes to these otaku?</br></br>  <br>This picture might trigger Re-Take PTSD</br>  <br>Perhaps what I want to say is, is that it hasn't changed very much. I still see people blaming Asuka fans for a lot of the trouble, and the only real break is some Kaworu fan incursion that attracts everyone's attention.<br><br><br>The scenes yes, I was referring to the character shots in which all except one is from 3.0. There's so little scenes of the guy in the other movies that you'll need to pick from 3.0.<br><br>That said, I don't think it's a suggestion of anything except the above. Although I am aware that Tsurumaki and the rest of the Eva writers are extremely biased. You don't have to convince me, it's just that I don't see a clear suggestion here.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Try to follow me here. To fall in love with Rei you actually need to be interested in the entirety of NGE and follow her character through it <br><br>To fall in love with Kaworu you need to watch 20 minutes, because that's all there is to Kaworu, he is a shipper-bait noncharacter</br></br></br>    <br>It looks like Rei scalped Asuka there.<br><br> Fortunately bodies are replaceable. </br></br></br>  <br>Reifags claiming superiority is actually kind of new; it resurfaced somewhat recently after several years of it gone. I'm sure Kaworufags shitposting extra hard has definitely taken the heat off of Asukafags, though.<br><br>The point however, is that whether 4 years ago or right now, it's all fucking retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>"Fujos" and "normalfags" aren't compatible labels.<br><br>There's obsessive fujos as well as otaku, and if he is out to punish people then he's not doing it right.<br><br>I think I've decided on your agenda however. You're a fujo that's defending the pandering you're getting by demonizing those who had to pay the price for it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Because you are being interviewed about the fucking movie?  <br>So why does he bring up a two-minute scene instead of every other part of the movie instead?<br>He likes him enough to talk about him rather than be dismissive (like Anno is to Rei, for example).<br>He's fond of him.<br><br> Being fond would mean he cares about him <br>So you're just arguing semantics at this point because you can't defend your original argument.<br>Drawing him on non-fujo merch like the GoS image is not 'neutral', he likes him enough to bring him up, add him into the music videos, and draw him without even being asked to.<br>He likes him as one might like chocolate ice cream. It's that simple.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah people can fag for a character with seeing nothing more then their character design. Not all Reifags give a shit about her complex character or her self actualization.</br>  <br> this comment again </br>  <br> To fall in love with Kaworu you need to watch 20 minutes, because that's all there is to Kaworu <br>And what's wrong with that? He's a minor character after all.<br> he is a shipper-bait noncharacter <br>There's nothing 'baity' about how he's presented in episode 24, it's all integral to Shinji's character.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Any side always claims superiority. That's sort of the point of there being a side in the first place.</br>  <br> So why does he bring up a two-minute scene instead of every other part of the movie instead? <br>Are you implying he doesn't talk about other parts of the movie in the CRC? Are you retarded? <br><br> drawing a NGE character on NGE merch means you love them  <br>Yeah ok, find me one single instance where Tsurumaki says he likes the character</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There's so little scenes of the guy in the other movies that you'll need to pick from 3.0. <br>Which is why I'm saying, why would Tsurumaki both adding him at all if there's no scenes? Because he liked him enough to add him, he wasn't pressured or told by anybody. <br>That's all I'm saying, no need to sperg over it.</br></br></br>  <br>I actually haven't been in these threads for awhile but I doubt that my response to a specific pic has been memed by now.</br>  This will never be how the elevator scene ends.  <br>It wasn't the same, but close to it, just tired of reading it.</br>  <br> And what's wrong with that? <br>Your colossal shit taste and limited brain-power.<br><br>Choosing him while presented with the intricately crafted, deep and meaningful characterisation of the main cast shows you have the mental capacity of a cow. <br><br>This leads to garbage like 3.0 being made</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "Fujos" and "normalfags" aren't compatible labels. <br>Yes, they are. Because Japanese fujos have friends, jobs, and lives. Most of them are schoolgirls or in university. <br><br> There's obsessive fujos as well as otaku <br>But these obsessive fujos are taking the money they make off of Kawoshin doujinshi and donating them to charity, what are the otaku doing again?<br>Oh yeah, exactly what Anno said they were doing in EoE.<br><br> I think I've decided on your agenda however. <br>Herewegoagain.jpeg<br>If you can't handle the heat, get out of the kitchen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fujoshi <br> schoolgirls or in university. <br><br>Do you even know what Fujoshi means?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well what other reaction do you think a pic of Rei wearing an Asuka wig and plug suite would generate?</br>  <br> Not all Reifags give a shit about her complex character or her self actualization. <br>They seem to do so generally. In every spinoff where it is cut or the character lacks substance, the Rei character is more or less dropped from their collective memory. Recent examples included.<br><br>But you can't argue the same for Asuka fans. Every spinoff since the original has actually done away with Asuka's vulnerabilities and strongly emphasized the character as a more positive version of the original, and it climaxed with the more serious Eva-story in Rebuild 2.0 and 3.0. It's not just a spinoff, it's written by the same author. That has leverage and must be taken seriously.<br><br>Asuka "Shikinami" might just be the most popular Asuka ever, despite having deeply betrayed the original's character. Most don't seem to notice or care either. <br><br>The people behind Evangelion are aware of this. In issue #14 of CUT Magazine, Sadamoto explains that they've changed Asuka's character which has led to it being more popular.<br>Recently, Anno was asked about why Asuka was more popular relative to Rei these days.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Are you retarded?  <br>The one who can't use reading comprehension to save his life, and would rather sperg out than calmly present his point is the only retard here.<br><br> Yeah ok, find me one single instance where Tsurumaki says he likes the character <br>Find me one single instance where Tsurumaki says he likes Rei or Asuka. Welp, seems he doesn't give a shit about them either!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're the one sperging. Most likely he was to feature all characters, and why not use recent scenes? Fans of Kaworu would want scenes from 3.0, in the same way Rei fans or Asuka fans wouldn't.</br>  <br> You do realize that only borderline mentally incompetent, legitimately self loathing people like Asuka? She has a horrible personality and any mentally healthy human being would find her Repulsive. Who on earth could actually be attracted to her? Are you so pathetically self hating that you can only imagine a relationship with someone who demeans and abuses you? Are you a a pathetic submissive who wants to be controlled by someone with no sense of empathy? People who prefer Asuka to Rei need to be put in mental institutions. </br>  <br> Yes, they are. Because Japanese fujos have friends, jobs, and lives. Most of them are schoolgirls or in university.  <br>I'm not seeing why this isn't true for otaku.<br><br> But these obsessive fujos are taking the money they make off of Kawoshin doujinshi and donating them to charity, what are the otaku doing again? <br>Not really an unusual thing in Japan, consider that Comiket and similar also do that.<br><br>But relax fujo. Enjoy the pandering while it lasts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Welp, seems he doesn't give a shit about them either! <br>And how exactly does this contradict my original statement?</br></br>  <br>Rei because in today's world Asuka would drop your sorry ass at an instant over some minor bullshit and probably go to the courts and claim that you raped her or some shit like that.</br>  <br> Your colossal shit taste and limited brain-power. <br>What a compelling argument.<br><br> Choosing him while  <br>There's nothing wrong will choosing to be attached or emotionally invested in the character that appeals to you most.<br>What's wrong with people liking Kaworu?<br>What's wrong with people liking Touji?<br>What's wrong with people liking Fuyutsuki?<br>They're all minor characters, and yet fans might prefer them over the main characters for other reasons; that doesn't invalidate the depth of said main characters, it just means they aren't emotionally attached to them.<br>If Rei and Asuka were guys, you wouldn't see nearly half the people in these threads obsessing over them as you do now. Does that mean your love for them is shallow? No, it just means that their superficial traits is part of what appeals to you. Nothing wrong with that, different strokes for different folks after all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think it'd warrant any as it has been posted enough.</br>  <br>Tsurumaki is a confirmed Asuka fan though.<br><br>Also in recent times, in the 2.0 CRC he is gushing about Asuka and explaining he wants her to have a leading role, and is actually at the forefront of developing Asuka as a likable character. After 3.0 there was an interview with him, and he said Asuka was really cute in the scene where she attacks Shinji.<br><br>He doesn't like Rei though. He wants Rei dead and out of the way. Probably related to his Asukafaggotry.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, do you?</br>  <br><br>W-why is Asuka blushing?</br></br>  <br> for other reasons <br>Yes their limited brain-power and not being able to cope with NGE's complexity <br><br>You are being presented with a bag of garbage (Kaworu) next to the Mona Lisa (Rest of the cast) and saying the bag of garbage is more beautiful</br></br></br></br>  Rei as fuck buddy<br>Misato as Neesan<br>Asuka as wife<br>Kaworu as just a friend nothing weird here I fell over<br><br>This is the natural way of things.<br><br> tfw BD's and 4.0 are coming </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Most likely he was to feature all characters <br>He had full control over what he wanted to do with the music video. He chose not to include Misato, but rather Kaworu.<br>It's his own preferences, showing that he does indeed give at least a bit of a shit.<br><br><br> I'm not seeing why this isn't true for otaku. <br>Because it's not, see EoE or Otaku no video or something.<br><br> Not really an unusual thing in Japan, consider that Comiket  <br> Comiket <br>Nigga, do you even know who started Comiket? What its origins are? Thanks for proving my point, see you in the 4.0 generals.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reifags are sort of superior though. At least as superior as you can get for being a fag. No wonder Anno hates them as do every other Asuka fan.</br>  <br>Because Tsurumaki obviously likes Asuka and Rei. And to some extent, he likes Kaworu too.<br>He's not neutral and he doesn't not give a shit, if any of the evidence I've presented is indicative.</br></br>  <br>The hero we need <br><br>Asuka spinoff when?</br></br></br>  <br>Misato isn't a child, that is the common denominator for those. Again I think you're just reaching.</br>   tfw no berserk anime to be found <br>recommend me one anon cmon</br>  <br>You presented no evidence then using faulty logic to prove nothing</br>  <br>see <br><br>None of the writers @ Khara like Rei. Whether or not Tsurumaki is positive towards Kaworu is up in the air, but I don't doubt that he is.</br></br></br>  <br>Ironically, if you compare Kaworu to your average character from a moeshit or harem Anime, he becomes the Mona Lisa.<br>Point is no one is denying the depth and complexity of the other characters or Eva in general. They're just choosing to become invested in the character that impacted them the most.<br>For some it could be Shinji, for others it could be someone like Yui.<br>Different strokes for different folks.</br></br></br></br>   tfw none of these characters are real <br> even if they were, they wouldn't want anything to do with you </br>  <br> Ironically, if you compare Kaworu to your average character from a moeshit or harem Anime, he becomes the Mona Lisa. <br><br>No he doesn't a random harem protagonist has more depth then Kaworu, he is a non-character, a plot-device</br></br></br>  <br> Misato isn't a child <br>She's a main character in 1.0/2.0, and yet she isn't featured in the music video that is supposed to represent these movies. And yet Kaworu is (from 3.0, no less). <br>That was Tsurumaki's decision, if he didn't give a shit about Kaworu he wouldn't have put him in or decide to draw him on non-fujo merchandise.<br>The one who denies this is reaching, I think.</br></br></br></br>  <br> If Rei and Asuka were guys, you wouldn't see nearly half the people in these threads obsessing over them as you do now <br>Not really. Their characters are good, and Shinji made the top. Why not them as well?<br><br>Don't use what ifs to justify your argument. <br><br>As it happens, kaworu is a shallow pandering character. The emotional attachment you have to the character isn't something people doubt, but the reasons behind them.<br><br>It also makes it perfectly clear that Kaworufags are assholes because they would literally watch everything burn to have Kawoshin the movie. Since you like what if's so much, please imagine what 4.0 would look like if Kaworu got shat on as much as the other characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, I did:<br> and <br><br>Considering you're the one who hasn't presented evidence for your side, I'd say my case he is more or less closed. Thanks for playing.</br></br></br></br>  <br> She's a main character in 1.0/2.0 <br>again she's not a child. That's the common denominator.<br><br>You are reaching, very much.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Tsurumaki drew a picture featuring Kaworu, not Kaworu alone but simply featuring Kaworu  <br> Tsurumaki directed movies and videos featuring Kaworu, not Kaworu alone but simply featuring Kaworu  <br> This means Tsurumaki likes Kaworu  <br><br>As expected from a fujo</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No he doesn't a random harem protagonist has more depth then Kaworu <br>This is objectively wrong. Kaworu presented more complexity with his dilemma over free will and relationship with Shinji than any one-note harem protagonist has done, which is fall over chicks boobs and get nosebleeds.</br></br>  <br>Oh well, there we have Misato fags and Asuka fags blown away in one fell swoop</br>  <br> dilemma over free will <br>What? <br><br> relationship with Shinji <br>Jumps on Shinji's cock mere hours after meeting him<br><br>Kaworu is an insult to NGE</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Shinji made the top <br>And yet Shinji has little to no fans and no one buys his merchandise.<br>Likewise with Rei and Asuka, if they were guys, they would be receiving the Shinji treatment or be loved solely by fujos.<br><br> As it happens, kaworu is a shallow pandering character <br>In what fantasy of yours? If you only consider Kaworu nothing but &gt;hurr, gay! <br>then that only goes to show you either didn't get Eva or episode 24 or you're just too immature to handle it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If he didn't like him, he wouldn't go out of his way to include him and draw pictures of him.<br>I never said he loved him, just a casual like.<br>Not my fault that fact causes you to sperg so much.<br><br><br>Congrats, one of the most easiest to understand parts of Eva completely went over your head!<br>Perhaps an Anime akin to Shingeki no Kyojin would be more agreeable to your mind? (Or lack, thereof?)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaworu is literally "hurr gay" and nothing more <br><br>He was a fucking plot-device and should have stayed one</br></br></br>  <br> he wouldn't go out of his way <br><br>He is not going out of his way you cretin, it's his fucking job to create Eva related content. Jesus H. Christ does any part of your brain function properly?</br></br></br>  <br> one of the most easiest to understand parts of Eva <br>Well then you won't have any issue explaining it to me</br></br>  <br> Kaworu is literally "hurr gay" and nothing more  <br>Spoken like the same type of faggot who will claim Shinji is a pussy, Rei is a doll, and Asuka is a bitch.<br>Also, &gt;Congrats, one of the most easiest to understand parts of Eva completely went over your head!<br>Perhaps an Anime akin to Shingeki no Kyojin would be more agreeable to your mind? (Or lack, thereof?)<br><br><br> He is not going out of his way you cretin <br>He's drawing Kaworu on the cover of a game that fujos would never buy. No one who buys that game cares about Kaworu, so whether he's on the cover or not does not affect them. And yet Tsurumaki chose to include him, in front of Shinji no less.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not a fan of spoonfeeding retards, but I'll make an exception.<br>Feast on one of my older posts.</br></br>  <br>Your fucking screencap agrees with me you moron. <br><br>He was a shallow love interest that wasn't developed at all. Cherry-coating it with "but he has so much potential" garbage doesn't change reality</br></br></br>  <br>It was unexplored and ultimately of little note compared to the main characters of the series, but it was undoubtedly there.<br>Kaworu as a character/plot-device/whatever the fuck you want to call him serves a purpose in NGE. Multiple purposes actually. <br>Ranging from exposition, to Shinji's character development, to presenting a new light onto the mindset of the angels. <br>There are people who will find this appealing just as there are people who will find another minor character like Hikari appealing.<br>It's up to you on whether you want to look at Eva with an open-mind or not, instead of just turning your head away because the gay makes you uncomfortable.<br>Bring me back to my point that if Asuka or Rei were guys, your perception of them would be changed radically.<br>Nonetheless, my interest to keep arguing in circles with you is completely overshadowed by me continue playing DeSu2<br>Good night, anon.<br>And remember: different strokes for different folks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>sauce?</br></br>  <br> There are people who will find this appealing just as there are people who will find another minor character like Hikari appealing. <br><br>And as I said those people are morons that can't appreciate the beauty and complexity of the main-cast so they latch onto feel-good characters like Kaworu, who has no depth and no negative traits. <br><br> You are just homophobic <br>Won't even dignify this with an answer <br><br>You have no counter-argument other then "respect muh feelings".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I've only been introduced to EVA for about a year and every thread about Asuka/Rei is instant 300 replies.<br><br>How do you fags put up with this for more than 10 years. That said, Reifags are the worst. Doll fuckers through and through.</br></br>    <br>As a Misatofag, I can only but agree with this statement.</br>  <br>Taaki.</br>  <br>hahaha thank you /a/non</br>  <br>Watching EVA when you are 14 damages you for life</br>  <br> And as I said those people are morons <br>No one is denying or not acknowledging the depth of the main characters, they're just choosing to become emotionally invested in others.<br>Take for example Sadamoto, who says his favorite characters are Gendo and Fuyutsuki; does that suddenly make him a moron who can't appreciate Shinji, Rei and Asuka? No. It's just his own tastes.<br><br> they latch onto feel-good characters like Kaworu <br>Isn't that what Anime and art is about? <br>A medium that is designed to cater to you and entertain you, make you feel good and maybe teach you something in the process.<br>Kaworu's 'feel-good' aspects are required for him to be who he is as a role to the story and as a role to Shinji. <br><br> who has no depth and no negative traits <br>Wrong and wrong.<br><br> Won't even dignify this with an answer  <br>It's not that you're homophobic, you're just uncomfortable. <br>If someone posts and gushes about Hikari, you'd likely not go out of your way to call her one-note and that anon a moron for even so much as praising her.<br>Yet if someone does the same with Kaworu, you will undoubtedly berate them because the existence of Kaworu himself invites rage and causes you to be uncomfortable. <br>Why that may be is something I can only speculate on.<br><br> You have no counter-argument other then "respect muh feelings" <br>And isn't that what art is? Each individual looks at a piece and makes their own subjective interpretation on said piece. They feel their own impact from it, and that's what makes art so great.<br>Eva is the same in that aspect, everyone feels something different from it; but all said things are valid.<br><br>Now, I'd like to get back to DeSu2. Take care, anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Mari is Shinji's mental construct.  <br>hes not bi. hes just so autistic that he mistakes affection for u want sum fuk?</br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if the same was true for Kaworu at this point.</br>  <br> Isn't that what Anime and art is about?  <br> And isn't that what art is <br>No it's not, does the fucking Guernica cater to you and make you feel good, does Goya's Saturn make you feel good? I won't get into a debate about the purpose of art, because quite frankly I don't think you could keep up. <br><br> Wrong and wrong <br>Then present a fucking counter-argument, the only negative trait Kaworu has is that he is a retard, but no Kaworufag will admit to that. <br><br>Liking Kaworu simply means you don't have the capacity to understand and enjoy complex characters and you settle for shallow-garbage.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd like to continue this conversation had you displayed any semblance of rationality or ability of reading comprehension, but you're clearly too angry to contribute in a mature manner.<br>Next time, I advise you to cool your head down before you start since clearly Kaworu is such a riling topic for you.<br><br>But then again, is there really any benefit in arguing with someone like you who wouldn't even be engaging in this conversation in the first place had Kaworu been a girl or not had the whole gay thing with Shinji? <br>It seems like a complete waste of my time when you have shown time and time again that you'll ignore half of my posts just because you can't think of a rebuttal and yet still have the nerve to claim I'm somehow in the wrong. <br>I'd love to know what you think about all these famous Anime directors and mangaka who praise Kaworu, a good chunk being males mind you. <br>And what about all those expies Kaworu has shit out? But yeah, no impact or iconic value whatsoever beyond teh gay, right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ad verecundiam and ad populum in the same post, impressive. Don't latch on to me calling you a retard, defeat my arguments if you can. <br><br>Kaworu is extremely shallow, the only interesting but completely ignored and often outright negated bit about him is his intent to eradicate humanity. <br><br>Thinking that art is there to pander to you and make you feel good is some of the dumbest shit I have ever read in my life. And just confirms my suspicion about Kaworufags, either not caring about NGE enough to fully explore it or just being plain dumb <br><br> You are just homophobic  <br>Still not going to dignify this with an answer</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some people prefer personality. How you like Rei is beyond me. Might as well marry a box.</br>  <br>reifag autists</br>  <br>Not him but that whole 'my opinion is the objective truth' way of thinking isn't the right way to go about things,<br>Especially with an Anime like Eva that has a little bit of something for everyone.</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry but Kaworu is objectively a shallow shipper-bait <br><br>Latching onto him shows you have no interest in good written, complex characters. Or you never gave a fuck about NGE and just picked a token character which you will champion.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe it's just Reifags with the colossal faggotry that needs to be addressed here. Problem enough that the creators all hate you for being autist faggots?</br>  <br>Because no, means yes strongly. In japan.</br>  <br> even though I find Rei's body hotter </br>  <br> He doesn't realize that Tsurumaki only hopped on to direct the new movies because he wanted to improve on Rei-3 </br>  <br>Why is he so perfect?</br>  <br>:|</br>  <br>ARK pls</br>  <br>Glad to know you're an insecure cuck too.</br>  <br> shipper-bait <br>It's not bait if it's canon :^)</br></br>  Since Asuka is popular as a "waifu" I was wondering how her fans take to her having a huge crush on someone other than MC? I usually see this aspect either ignored or replaced with Shinji shipping or something. I never got the vibe she was in love with the younger boy or had feelings as intense as those for Kaji.  <br>Look, it was easy as fuck to see that post was his, but now he's going to start wearing his trip.</br>  <br>I did it on purpose. Attentionwhores will whore at the first signal of attention.</br>  <br>It's shippers hand-waving it. <br>They claim it's not "real love" and yet they claim AsukaxShinji somehow is, when if it came to a decision Asuka would pick Kaji every fuck time without hesitation.</br></br>  <br>I never had an issue with Asuka being in love with Kaji. He's such a smooth guy and if I was a girl I would fall for him too probably.</br>  <br>If he claims he doesn't attentionwhore, then how come he's always posting those pictures that everyone knows only belong to him?</br>  <br>That's hypocritical because females can be just as pathetic or depraved as males. Just because 3.33 pandering is for fujos doesn't make it acceptable.</br>  <br>But it's okay when they do it because they're women. Anno is a full-blown feminist faggot, didn't you know? He loves that double standard shit.</br>  <br>from Fargo apparently m8, some comedy series. I wanted to know too.

That's not what I want to talk about though. I'm just wondering should I drop the last six episodes or just watch them. For those that have seen them, does it get better? Or do you believe that since I haven't liked it so far, I still won't like the last six episodes? Honest feedback wanted, thanks.  <br> I've seen 19 episodes of Shinsekai Yori <br> and I still haven't liked it <br>Believable.</br></br></br>  <br>I found the end utterly predictable but a lot of people like it.<br>It doen't help you much, I guess.</br></br>  Squealer forces maria and that pussy to take drugs and then have sex to have the baby, after its born he kills them both. I thought it was pretty good.  <br>Is that the ending? Or is there more</br>  Worldbuilding was very interesting, best in any anime I've seen imo. And the end was pretty good. The plot twist in the last 5 minutes of the last episode hit me like a bus.  It's just more world building. If you didn't find the world building to be interesting prior to this you still won't care. While the conclusion is interesting it's not exactly satisfying.  <br> Squealer forces maria and that pussy to take drugs and then have sex to have the baby, <br>literally headcanon</br></br>  Well I guess I'll just skim threw the final episodes and watch the last episode fully. I'm gonna leave this thread now for spoilers. You guys can keep talking about the anime if you like. Bye and thanks for answers  Literally one of the worst shows I've seen. Terrible dialogue and writing, predictable to a painful degree and so much shallower than it thinks it is. Its handling of the moral and ethical quabdries it brings up is at best clumsy and at worst offensive. The characters were amongst some of the most bland and uninspiring I've seen in anime.<br><br>Good art style, OST and beginning tho</br></br>  <br>After the time skip (chapter 5-6, I think) the show starts to go down. I admire you to survive 19 episodes, I surrendered at 12.</br>  <br>You're in the final arc after the last reveal and leading up to the climax. If you don't like it now and didn't like it before you will not like it by the time it ends.<br><br>Who's putting you up to this shit, honestly? Do you have no autonomy of your own or do you feel it's required to sit through a cartoon you don't enjoy and can voluntarily stop watching at any point?</br></br></br>  <br> The characters were amongst some of the most bland and uninspiring I've seen in anime. <br><br>Watch more anime.</br></br></br>  <br> Literally one of the worst shows I've seen <br>Shit taste.</br></br>  <br>I generally avoid shows in which I'm likely to encounter generic character archetypes (seasonal SoL, most Shonens, etc) - I doubt the number of shows I've watched is the issue. I've experienced worse characters than those in Shinsekai Yori, certainly, but I'm struggling to recall duller ones; literally damp cardboard tier personalities made all the worse by their lack of chemistry</br>  <br>Yes, its a shame because it started quite well</br>  <br>Give me examples of well-written characters in anime as well as anime with great writing so I can tell you you're wrong and your taste is shit.</br>  <br> Literally one of the worst shows I've seen. <br><br>Watch more anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh boy, like where this is going,<br>Well written characters: Watashi from Jinrui, Smile from PP, MC of Mononoke, Toshihiko from Kemonozume, Togame from Katanagatari<br><br>Well written shows: LoTGH, Katanagatari, Tatami Galaxy, SEL</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't finish shit shows, this one started well</br>  <br> Tatami Galaxy is well-written.  <br> well-written <br>Pretentious faggot.  I agree with everything else and genuinely like all of those shows. Good taste, anon. </br></br></br>   faggoty edgelords are the first ones to awaken with powers <br> people have to be programmed in order for society to exist <br>This story is beyond just pessimism about the human condition. The author just doesn't trusts the human condition, and maybe even hates humans.<br><br>Either way the premise is laughable at best</br></br></br></br>  <br> tatami galaxy <br> pretentious and badly written <br>pick one friendo :^)</br></br></br>  <br>Haha I know. It's cause my girlfriend really wanted me to see it</br>  <br>This is not true.</br>  <br>I bet you love SnK and naruto, shinsekai its from a novel , its different from a stupid shonen</br>  <br>Just watch it. I watched it till the end just cus that ed is nice as fuck yo and because I can't drop something even if I don't like it, I need to know how it ends.</br>  <br>I always thought they lobotomized them and then forced them to have sex. I haven't gotten to that part yet in the novel so I hope its clearer there</br>  <br>If you haven't liked it up until now, you probably won't get drawn in in the last eps. The interesting part of the show is the setting and its ramifications, and if you didn't enjoy that then there isn't much else. That said, you should finish the show  for the GF .</br>  <br> faggoty edgelords are the first ones to awaken with powers <br>The first humans to "awaken" to PK were the kids experimented on by that Azerbaijani guy Imran Ismailov, and the very first was some random Azerbaijani girl. It's never asserted that all PK users were edgelords either, but obviously the edgelords running around killing everyone are going to leave a bigger mark on history.<br><br> people have to be programmed in order for society to exist <br>For a society where everyone is pretty much a walking nuke, perhaps so. The author never asserts that Saki's society would be necessary; he merely presents it as one solution and looks at its consequences.<br><br> Either way the premise is laughable at best <br>Certainly, there's no way a human can output that much power in reality based on mere QM. But sci-fi is generally about the consequences of a premise, not the premise itself. FTL and other handwavy things are bullshit too, but they allow for more interesting stories.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oh I just finished watching this show a few days ago, and I really enjoyed it. One of my favourite parts was when they travelled in the mountains in winter. It felt so real, I really wanted to go to the mountains myself. It really feels real, the art is amazing. <br><br>For the plot, I think that was really great too. A bit too scary at times, but I managed to get through it although I had to look up spoilers before I dared watching the final few episodes.<br><br>The setting was really great, and the art felt so real, makes me want to go out in nature to experience it myself. A solid 8/10 in my opinion.</br></br></br></br>   The previous villain comes back to help MC take down the new villain of the series   <br>Yes.

Down from 9.0-9.1k for v1wk1s of s1-2.

Notice how this list hasn't updated its numbers for Born yet? That's because Born hasn't been out for a full week yet. The numbers we have now are from amazon preorders, nothing else. Pure stalker points. I need to remind you that mahouka had 4k amazon preorder points, yet look where that one ended up.</br></br>  <br> In summary though, those changes were fucking idiotic. <br>Yeah I think this is something everyone can agree with, even if Ex was "planned" and the whole thing was a set up, its a pretty risky and dumb one, and terribly executed which is why I seriously doubt that theory.<br><br>It would have been pretty great if they did planned it and pulled it off while hinting at shit not being right, like events changing from one day to the other (Like the sitri game getting rescheduled only a day before the match) and having Gasper mention having an odd feeling, which would then be tied to the explanation the kids give that they are able to travel back with his help .<br><br>But in the end we just got a big mess, and what feels like ishibumi pulling shit out of his ass to make it work, not saying that EX will be bad but it IS shit he is pulling out of his ass to save the season.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  LNs is the response to Yaoi fangirls hijacking Shounen Jump and shounen manga.
