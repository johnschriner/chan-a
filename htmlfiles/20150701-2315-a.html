[ So what relation do they have to Shirou and Rin?  Besides having their designs based on them absolutely nothing.  They're them from an alternate universe where Tokiomi had a son and Kerry adopted a little girl.  Wow that is pretty blatant.  <br>I still think that's not a gender bent Rin, but a young none edge Kerry.</br>  <br><br>I want to be the bone of her Sword.</br></br>  <br> They're them from an alternate universe where Tokiomi was cucked by Kerry <br>FTFY.<br>Because the kid definitely looks nothing like Tokiomi.</br></br></br>  Fate/Grand Order takes place in 2015.<br>Fate/Stay Night takes place in 2004.<br><br>They're unrelated.</br></br></br>  <br>Takeuchi confirmed he based the designs around them in the latest TM Ace.</br>  They're alternate universe Shirou and Rin who were born approximately eleven years later than the ones we're familiar with.  The big question s whether or not they will fuck.<br><br>Given where Fem-Shirou's left hand is, I'm going to say yes.</br></br>  <br>You're assuming they'll co-exist.<br><br>Assuming they're both silent protagonists, the other one probably won't exist depending on who you pick.</br></br></br>  <br>We honestly don't really know anything about the story though. Supposedly there's more than a million lines of text though.<br><br>On that subject somewhat, has Nasu ever really written a true silent protagonist? Not even Extra really did that.</br></br></br>  Soon.  <br>It could be a Pokemon situation where the unchosen one becomes your rival/love interest.</br>  <br>So what, exactly, is she gonna do? Is she a support type? Is she gonna buff the party? Because I can't really see her as a frontal assault type. I mean, really, I doubt she could even out-skill Avenger.</br>  <br>Could also be like Capsule Servant, where picking your character causes the story to branch into different routes.</br>  When does grand order come out, and can I play it on a US phone?  <br>Brotha from the same face.</br>  <br>Comes out this July. Pretty sure it's on Android, so you should be able to nab it, but it'll be in Japanese.</br>  <br>If she is indeed Aias she'll be fine since they're hyping her all.</br>  <br>Meant Jeanne. It looks like she's wielding a flag, so I assume she's support. Plus, it's not like anyone expects Jeanne d'Arc to have great combat skills.</br>  <br>Its Shiki and Sacchin.</br>  <br>What vn?</br>  <br>Fate/Grand Order.</br>  Cont. discussion, and speculation from    want to play Tsukihime in Japanese <br>  CD-DA music doesn't loop on Win 7 (not even on XP, I think), want to use custom music too <br>  EOPs with their patch can just drop files into a folder <br>  I have to install special software, set Tsukihime to work with it and write a custom ini file by hand <br><br> You win this one EOPs.</br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Best girl.</br>   still no satsuki route   <br>Red skirt looks better, but damn she's still the hottest of the bunch.</br>  <br>Satsuki got 2 redesigns.<br>TM finally admitting she is the most important Tsukihime heroine.</br></br>    <br>Hisui a best.</br>  <br>Her school uniform was always blue and white.</br>  Shiki looks pretty damn good in this one<br><br>Also, <br>That face on top of the page hnng</br></br></br>  <br>I actually like the Arc redesign.<br><br>The only thing that bothers me is the sameface on all the characters.</br></br></br>  <br>Arc looks pretty good here too. Shame about the skirt though.</br>  <br>He looks like Shiki now.</br>  <br>You know what bother me about the mini-skirt? The fact that Tsukihime happens it was uncommon for girls going around dressed like that.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Roa, SHIKI and Nero when?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> complaining about sameface in "anime" characters designs. </br>  <br>I prefer it over the original.</br>  <br>And even more Arc considered the fact that she has been sleeping for a shit ton years.<br><br><br>He's shirou with black hair, a fucking recolor. I don't really that but he looks good I guess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's finally Sacchin's time to shine</br>  <br>don't really like* that</br>  <br>No.<br>It's Arihiko's time.</br></br>  <br> And even more Arc considered the fact that she has been sleeping for a shit ton years. <br>That's irrelevant. She downloads necessary info when she wakes up.</br></br>  <br> Who? </br>  <br>remake moves the game to a more urban and a more modern setting, look it up in the interview</br>  <br>Considering she was always going to have a route i'm sure she will have it this time around. <br><br>It will also help with sales the fact that you get a new route.</br></br></br>  <br>Imagine if she does get her route but the game ends up being all ages.</br>  <br>Yes she does, but if she's in a time where it's uncommon for girls to use mini-skirt, she gets information that girls use longer ones and then she goes and puts a damn mini-skirt?<br>Doesn't make sense, why would she go for the uncommon thing? She always tries to fit in</br></br>  <br> Lancer's face <br> Shirou's hair <br> UBW Gil's casual attire </br></br></br>  <br><br> posting blank pictures </br></br>  <br> that <br> Shirou's hair </br></br>  <br>She doesn't look nearly as perfect as she did before. Heck even new Ciel could give her a run for her money.</br>  <br>Actually his eyes are different from Shirou and his hair originally doesn't look like that.</br>  <br>Why is he so handsome? <br>I hope he gets a more relevant role in the remake.</br></br>  <br>TM doesn't make eroges anymore anon. Mahoyo was all ages and Fate has been retconned a long while ago. <br>They're rich now, they don't give a fuck anymore about their old fanbase(yeah i'm mad)<br><br>Tsukihime is going all ages too</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tsukihime took place in the year 2000. Miniskirts weren't uncommon back then, especially in Japan.<br><br>Plus, it's possible that the remake will receive a timeline update.<br><br>Besides, Fate/stay night and Fate/hollow ataraxia take place shortly after Tsukihime and I don't see you complaining about the miniskirts in those.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shiki looks good but when are we getting best Shiki's redesign?</br>  <br> Plus, it's possible that the remake will receive a timeline update. <br><br>No because it would fuck the entire Nasuverse timeline, unless you want Aoko to be like 40 when she meets Shiki</br></br></br>  <br><br>Akiha looks like the best girl, which she is.</br></br>  <br> they don't give a fuck anymore about their old fanbase <br>PFFFFFFFFTHAHAHAHAAHAHAAHAAAA. What?</br></br>  <br> TM doesn't make eroges anymore anon. Mahoyo was all ages and Fate has been retconned a long while ago. <br> retconned <br>No, they just can't sell the eroge on anything but PC. They just had an R18 re-release on PC in 2014.</br></br></br>  <br><br> unless you want Aoko to be like 40 when she meets Shiki <br> implying time and age mean shit to Aoko </br></br></br>  <br>I don't want to believe and I won't until I hear it from Nasu himself.</br>  <br>It's because there're fucking people who use the term "eroge" whenever they bitch about FSN.<br>Fuck that shit. What's so bad about being an eroge?</br></br>  <br>It's what you use as an insult when you can't think of anything else.</br>  <br>Nasu should just completely rewrite SHIKI and Roa. They had an interesting backstory but they were still lame.</br>  <br> implying people play TM VNs for h-scenes <br><br>you must be new, that is the only answer</br></br></br>  <br>Glad to see Akiha remains perflat and supreme.</br>  Type Moon proving it can't stop recycling its 2 series.  <br>Any descent magi can extend their lifespan so nothing wrong with that.</br>  <br>Not as bad as Nintendo.#</br>  <br>One of Akiha's arcade ends where she speaks with Aoko.</br>  <br>Screencap or it didn't happened</br>  <br>Source? Can't find anything about that, anywhere. <br><br>You're not lying to me are you anon? I mean why would you LIE on the internet r-right?<br><br><br>Prepare your heart then, TM doesn't make eroge. <br><br>Because they're fucking retarded, normalfags should kill themselves</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Because they're fucking retarded, normalfags should kill themselves <br>Normalfags are where the money is. If you don't want them influencing your Japanese obscurities then become a super rich millionaire and buy Type-Moon.</br></br>  <br> Normalfags are where the money is <br>Very wrong.</br></br>  <br>Then why pander to normalfags?</br>  <br>Maybe for anime, not for VN anon. <br><br>They should just make 2 versions, one with sex the other without it. It's not hard, really it's not. They could add a kiss instead of sex and just fix a few dialogues. <br>That's fucking it</br></br></br></br>  <br>Who know? Pandering to otakus is way more common than pandering to normalfags.</br>  <br> They should just make 2 versions, one with sex the other without it. It's not hard, really it's not. <br>It costs more money. All the same people will buy it anyway. Therefore no money is gained.</br></br>  <br>Is that some new character?</br>  From interviews I get the feeling that no H-scenes is less about pandering to normalfags and more about simply not wanting to do them and being big enough now that they don't have to.  <br>For VNs is the same, just look at Clannad or Steins;Gate. Both are all-ages.</br>  <br> It costs more money <br><br>How much deleting a sex scene for a kiss could cost?</br></br></br>  <br><br>The fact that the sex scenes were the worst and the stupidest things in F/SN and Tsukihime should already be enough to make you shut up. No sex scene is better than that trash. But I guess that for mindless idiots like you everything that has sex in it is automatically great.</br></br>  <br> How much deleting a sex scene for a kiss could cost? <br>Marketing it, selling off the differing copies, licencing, changing the box art, giving more incentives to buy the others, etc<br><br><br>Why not look at Muvluv too, while you're at it?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Akiha's route just wouldn't feel the same without the physical aspect of the forbidden love.</br></br>  <br>Because Muv Luv sales aren't nowhere near to those two.</br>  <br> Source? Can't find anything about that, anywhere. <br>FSN RN was released for PSP and H scenes are not for sony products because of the sony rules this is the reason why RN doesnt have H scenes sameshit happend for other VN too</br></br>  <br>Who's saying that sex makes everything great?<br>It's just the fucking conclusion of the romance between two characters jesus christ. <br><br>Why does sex offend you anon?</br></br></br></br>  From what I can tell, Nasu doesn't really like writing sex scenes. He feels he has no talent for them. He has no reason to write them now that he doesn't have to.  <br>I don't have the game anymore but is  sufficient for you?</br>  <br>None of the routes. <br><br>What would they do? be friends?</br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that Tsukihime remake will have no lewd just like Mahoyo</br>  <br>It doesn't matter as much for anyone else as it does with Shiki.<br>Most of his character is about sex and if you take that away from him then you just have a psychopath which isn't really that much different from other characters in TM, like can you imagine the Arc stalking scene without him being on the brink of a orgasm the whole time.</br></br>  <br>Looks like she just want to piss Akiha off.</br>  <br><br>This is a remake. It will be rewritten, so the whole thing will probably change a lot actually.</br></br>  <br>Shiki is a fucking rapist, that's like half his character.</br>  <br>Just because there are no H-scenes doesn't mean it'll be scrubbed of anything sexual. And they could still have fade to black/implied sex like Saber got in RN.</br>  <br>and he is raped too.</br>  <br>They never wanted to make a eroge game in the first place</br>  <br>Really? What motive would Aoko have to do that? Besides it's Melty anon, not exactly the greatest source of canon in the world.</br>  So pic related won't rape maids anymore? WHAT THE FUCK?  <br>Why can't he use a something better to cut people? <br>Why does it have to be the shitty knife? he could have longer range with a katana and I'm sure he knows how to use one considering he's a superhuman DNA freak trained to kill people</br></br>  <br>When Melty is serious is prefectly canon as it was written by Nasu himself. But yeah, that is obviously a joke scene.</br>  <br>Actually, in RN, the narrative explicitly states that they literally only slept together. No sex, just sleeping.</br>  <br> Why does sex offend you anon? <br><br>see<br><br><br> The fact that the sex scenes were the worst and the stupidest things in F/SN and Tsukihime should already be enough to make you shut up. No sex scene is better than that trash. <br><br>Maybe, just maybe, I was talking about Type Moon sex scenes, and not about sex scenes in general.<br>Your reading reading comprehension is pretty crappy. Or maybe <br><br><br> Who's saying that sex makes everything great? <br><br>Myabe because it's clear that as long as it's sex you not only will eat any kind of rubbish, but you will even angrily demand it like a bunch of hungry flies.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Nasi thinks his sex scenes are shit. Thus, he no longer wishes to write them.<br><br>Nasu has the freedom to pick and choose what he wants to write now.</br></br>  <br>Like I said, I don't have a problem with them having sex because it's a conclusion of the romantic feelings those 2 characters are having. <br><br>What can you add to make 2 characters feel more like a couple? A kiss? a hug? it's not on the same level(emotional or physically) as having sex, it's really not. <br><br>I wouldn't mind fade to black like pic related. In fact i'd like it A LOT.<br>But no sex feels bland, like in UBW adaptation not even a fucking kiss. Jesus christ I felt Shirou and Rin were just friends even in the end</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> standups <br>Is that what the Japanese call legs these days?</br></br>  <br>Thanks fucking God for that.</br>  <br>But now I will never finish my thesis on aquatic organisms.</br>  <br>Because it's a relic of the Nanayas, not just any knife.</br>  <br>I have never said that I disagree with that, what you wrote is about sex scenes in general, and that's not I was talking about. Yeah, good sex scene put in the right context could only be a good thing. <br>Sadly, that's not how Type Moon worked. And, as some anons have already posted, it seems that Nasu is well aware of that.</br></br>  <br>So is no one going to point out that Sacchin has a 3rd-year's ribbon color while Ciel has a 1st year's? <br>Ciel even looks like a kouhai character with her redesign.</br></br>  What did he said about HF ?   Tsukihime remake  <br> Dark Souls 3 happens <br>RIP remake<br>RIP Sacchin route<br> inb4 Blood Borne 2 </br></br></br></br>  <br> it would fuck the entire Nasuverse timeline <br>Not if it takes place in an alternate universe.</br></br>  <br>Nasu is like fucking DC comics.<br><br> Ah don't mind about it, it happens in an alternate universe! </br></br></br>  <br>What does it have to do?</br>  Does anyone one in this thread currently have a copy of TM Ace. If you do could you post the full image of the Rider and Bazett, also some one said there was a chibichuki chapter; could you post that as well.  <br>Because a sword isn't easily concealable and way too conspicuous. A knife could easily be stored in his pocket without anyone noticing anything out of the ordinary. <br><br>One of Shiki's favored tactics when hunting for killers or vampires is to set himself as a potential harmless victim. He can't use that tactic while carrying a sword.<br><br>Also, it's against the law to carry weapons.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't read it in japanese now, wait for the remake.<br>I tried reading it in moon one year ago and the writing was so bad I wanted to gouge my eyes out</br></br>  <br>He said it's being made into 2 movies but he expects everyone comes to see it</br>  <br>  No sex scene is better than that trash. <br>It's not about his reading comprehension. It's because your expression was crap.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Nasu is a massive Soulsfag.</br>  <br>what 2 part for HF?</br>  <br>Does that mean Hisui with her red ribbon is Shiki's senpai now?  You're either overthinking or baiting. </br>  <br>Yeah. It's doomed</br>  <br>Jesus I wish there will be3-4 part of it</br>  <br>I think he is saying he will add new stuff to HF too as he did to UBW.</br>  <br>Why do you lie? He says nothing about 2 movies</br>  <br>Well yeah but I meant as when he's out hunting for an immortal dude with beasts in his fucking body. <br><br>Having a longer weapon wouldn't be a bad idea. not a Katana since I guess it doesn't fit perfectly with his style but still, longer than a fruit knife</br></br></br>  <br>Only 6 movies is enough.</br>  <br>Thank you, now all I need is that chibichuki chapter</br>  <br>I'm joking anon. Can't read moon.<br><br>But anyways we would need a lot of movies and I don't think UFO will do it. <br><br>It's different from KnK because the movies had a beginning and an end, what would they do in HF? one is SoL one is some fights, then SoL, then fights, then SoL, fights fights fights.<br><br>Don't know if you get what I mean.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And where would he get such a thing? It's not like he knows any weapons dealers.<br><br>And anything longer than a knife would be difficult to conceal.</br></br></br>  <br>Barely enough, 8 movies is fine.</br>  <br>then what about this? </br>  <br>Under that logic they would never make a TV anime either. And it doesn't make sense not going all out given what we know and what they did with everything else.<br><br>Also, episodic movies are the new fad.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck. <br>It was for </br></br>  <br> I can't really talk in detail about how HF is going to be made but the people who watched UBW will probably be surprised. <br> I'm really hyped, just like the fans, to go see it on the big screen </br></br>  <br>That doesn't make sense. A TV anime is not the same thing as a movie.<br><br>It should have a beginning and an end, you can do it with Persona for example(finish it with Moon boss fights) but Fate you can't because there's not a lot of climaxes. <br><br>Well i'm no expert but I don't see them being able to do more than 3 without making them a snorefest. And 3 would be bad</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anyone care to speculate on what the surprise is, or does he mean people who have no prior knowledge of the VN are going to be surprised?</br>  <br><br> X was the worst and the stupidest in Z series = (X in Z was trash). Y is better than (THAT trash) = Y is better than (X in Z) <br><br> There was no word about X being shit in general. <br><br>Yeah, such logic is too vague and complex for a common human brain.<br>Anon, stop it, please.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you do three, one would be basically build up with explanations, saber dying and stuff.<br>The second would be the mid-route climax, which is the rain scene, and some stuff with archer dying and yada yada.<br>The last one would be action nonstop with some infodumps here and there.</br></br></br>  <br>It seems it is just that they want to go all-out with HF.</br>  <br> people who watched UBW will probably be surprised. <br>They'll use PC version instead of RN</br></br>  <br>That part of the interview is basically Nasu and Takeuchi hyping us by saying that HF will be amazing.</br>  <br>HAHAHAHA.<br><br>No they won't. That's been retconned a while ago anon. I mean I wish they did but they won't, I at least won't keep my hopes up</br></br></br>  <br>I'm biased. Always thought Akiha was the best Turkeyhandle but damn, she looks great there.</br>  <br>He stole a mace from Louvre in Prelude.</br>  <br>It's probably 'the route is so different from UBW' surprise.<br>Especially since it starts by spoiling the shit out of Fate route with Saber, Kotomine and Zouken.</br></br>  So is anything like a release date being mentioned, or is this just another cock-tease to tide us over for 5 more years while Nasu plays Bloodborne?  <br>The later, it barely counts as a cocktease because<br> can't say shit </br></br>  <br>Just like they did with UBW right? I won't buy their crap.<br><br>Also why do people keep talking about Fate on a Tsukihime thread. Fuck off, I should also fuck off since I was talking about it too.</br></br></br>  <br>They still sell PC version and RN was for the vita release. They didn't retcon anything</br>  Thoughts on this list, /a/?  Anyone else watch it and make her your waifu? I know I did! She is PRIME waifu material. She is hella cute, mysterious, and just over all to me drop dead sexy!  If you decide to read the manga, drop it once  Urabe's clone  arrives  <br>Chuunibyou had more progress than this shit</br>  <br>I watched the whole anime and read the manga partially around this point. What happens when the clone arrives in the manga?</br>  <br>She's not really a clone, just a lookalike, but suffice to say everyone goes full retard and nothing is quite the same again</br>  <br>OH! The star girl? Who causes all the trouble etc. yuh i remem her. she pissed me off. URABE IS BAE!</br>  <br>I remember someone once said she was suppose to be some kinda alien or something but the guy was forced to drop it.</br>  <br>WIERD! T~T</br>  I actually like Youko more.  <br><br> bae <br> T~T <br>Holy fuck please leave</br></br></br></br>  no kissu ending. never forget.  dumping some urabe        This could've been such a great series.  <br>Nips always seem to have a great start but then just drop the ball sometime on the road to the end.</br>        If only her VA was even remotely capable of acting.                Chapter 67 is out, I didn't see a thread about it. Discuss  <br>what are you on about? It's already up to 71.</br>  <br>wait what? RAWS? its showing 67 on Bato.to</br>  <br>So is the water god really dead?</br>  <br>71 just had its final good cut released. We read the rough copy like a month ago. Waiting on 72 is the hot new thing</br>  <br>yup</br>   water loli and kiriha is dead <br>FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK</br>  <br>I hope  black lolis end up winning. <br><br>Also what the fuck is wrong with you captcha burgers aren't sandwiches.</br></br></br>  <br> burgers aren't sandwiches <br>They call them sandwiches on american tv shows all the time. I dont get why it always has to be food captcha though, a lot of food looks similar. Use stuff like houses, cars, animals, etc<br><br>Also if kiriha doesn't come back i fukken riot</br></br></br></br>  <br>If the author doesn't bring them back,  he has real balls </br>  <br>Don't encourage him. I can see kukuri staying dead but not kiriha, it was too sudden and not as satisfying as the badass god fight to the death</br>  <br> Chapter 67 is out <br>Are you from different timeline?<br>Also, wtf with this sorting...</br></br></br>  <br>I sometimes forget how bad my dyslexia is</br>  What's this talk of people being dead, I don't remember tsugomomo to be a particularly violent manga.  <br>Read it again nigger</br>  <br> Waiting on 72 is the hot new thing <br>2-3 more weeks at least. Also, chapter 79 should be out in Japan already, so I hope we get scans on this week.</br></br>  <br> 2-3 more weeks for 72 <br>Suffering</br></br>  I expect resurrection sheanigans, otherwise this is going in a pretty dark direction.  <br>My first thought was hourglass shota turning back time on confetti box</br>  Kanaka expects a lot from Kazuya.<br><br>The monthly wait is horrible.</br></br>  <br> sudden arc about a seige on yomi <br><br>Yes.<br><br> leaves almost no chance for hijinks <br><br>No.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It can't be helped - I working on scans alone (and at this point I prefer to stay it this way). A week for cropping and everything, one-two on cleaning and typesetting plus some time for partial redrawing for alpha.</br>  <br>Dont worry, there's still hijinks in the flashbacks, just a slightly different cast.

Even if  those two get brought back to life later,  a three-year time skip is going to completely change the series' setting.</br>  Man I hope they don't  stay dead. <br> Seeing Kiriha killed very abruptly kinda ruined my day. I know they're going to meet her in the pillow flashback, but it probably would not have MC and Kiriha interacting. Also, is it ending? I don't want this ride to end. <br><br>Also, more Sunao scenes pls.</br></br></br>  <br>where is this image?</br>  <br>Shit got real during the Kanaka arc.</br>  <br>im actually more surprised no one else died</br>  <br>In the chapter hes working on now</br>  <br>Wait, it died while he was drawing on the stream? Shit, that's dedication.</br>  <br>I came in while he was on break so im not sure if anything happened before but he just came back said the cat was dead and went on drawing. It could have been a friend's cat or something, i dont know</br>  <br>oh thanks</br>  That's it? No drama "Wah my obi is kill and you want me to kill muh mum"? No angsty running off into the mountains breaking branches off trees?  <br>I like it this way.</br>  <br>He knows that'd be a disservice to the two girls that sacrificed themselves to save his hide. His boner-loyalty is strong.</br>  <br><br>I was just surprised. I expected at least half a chapter of self loathing and mustering resolve. Kazuya is a man</br></br>  <br>he has constantly man up during the series, make him goes angsta is a regression many MC fell in and its fucking retarded.</br>  <br>Does he get a new Tsukogami?</br>  <br>no idea, I have kept myself away from the raws</br>  <br>I made this when it came out. Works a treat</br>  <br>Saved, thanks anon.</br>  <br>I made this one too for when there's no hope, but i try to stay positive<br> Kiriha is my waifu so im doing it pretty tough </br></br>  Why the fuck does Kanaka have to be the best girl?  She's a real nutjob but I still like her a lot   <br>The hourglass is a girl, anon. She's got breasts and a skirt on.</br>  <br> never stick your dick in crazy unless she got a bod like kanaka -Abraham Lincoln </br>  <br>Mate, if i had a dime for every person that had breasts and a skirt on that turned out to be a guy...</br>  <br>He's  still dreaming, looking through the past of his mom. He was apparently a naturally talented fighter like Kanaka, with the ability to create dangerous amasogi. Kanaka had a lot of expectations for him. </br>  Finally finished v14 omake. Expect it soon on site and elsewhere.  <br>Heh. Kokuyou's nest, huh?<br><br>Still wondering what's up with her being a bird and all, since so far, she's a pretty unique existence.</br></br></br>  <br>Same. Wings could be explained "lel fantasy", but nest...</br>  I am the only one who doesn't really give a fuck about Kiriha? I care more about Kukuri coming back  <br>Yes, you are.</br>  <br> Kiriha <br>why do you even read it?</br></br>  <br>Maybe some kind of, uh, bird tsukumogami?</br>  <br>Shes a tengu</br>  <br><br><br>she was made out of a Crow by kukuri to serve as a shrine maiden</br></br></br>  <br>Kukuri's great, but if you don't care about Kiriha,  is basically right - she's the main attraction. Plus, Kiriha's definitely coming back, and Kukuri's 50-50.</br>  <br>I think I remember it being said that the only monsters that exist are tsukumogami and amasogi. The one "tengu" that showed up in that crossover story with another manga ended up being a amasogi in the end.<br><br><br>Oh, do you remember when this was said? Or are you just chipping in on the conversation?</br></br></br></br>   there are actually people who don't care about kiriha or kukuri <br>These people are the reason hell exists</br>  <br> Oh, do you remember when this was said? Or are you just chipping in on the conversation? <br>im chipping in but she said that on the chapter where she ask for kazuya to bath her after the assassins let me look for it</br></br>  <br>I cried hard. I actually cried hard </br>  <br>Who needs them when Kokuyou is around?</br>  <br>Im with you, bro. We're with you</br>   You rage - you lose. <br><br> A borderline-H harem bathhouse about middle schooler Gary Stu <br> The manga started ok and has great art but soon devolved into a borderline porno as the humor started to stick to the lowest fruits (tentacle jokes for one) possible and the endless parade of young women managed to form one of the biggest harems known to manga around the Gary Stu protagonist. <br> The artist even sells nudity variants at conventions. As if even more is needed! The unending battles are complete nonsense because of the godlike powers on the leads part, all the bisexual women and his rapist waify are only there to bathe each other endlessly or masturbate each other to sleep (also used as "punishment") or feed on each others breasts for pages, or... With endless scenes like that all attempts at drama or romance become a joke and the fact the half the women (even some male characters changed genders to female) are "adult loli" with barely censored vaginas or completely uncensored anuses (gotta love japanese censorship double standards) which are spread open, stimulated and at display in most chapters the manga can´t be recommenced anymore. <br> There is also the selfcest (?!?), the borderline rape, the "watersports" and a (shota) dick or two also show up so what did i say about the low hanging fruits again? The series is neither hateful or vile but reading porn makes way more sense after a few volumes. You will barely notice the difference and the market is flooded with doujinshi for obvious reasons. Re:Monster (7/10) which i reviewed pulls off the godlike Gary Stu formula way better (for now) and Ran to Haiiro no Sekai (8,5/10) is great and excessively well drawn. Both have nudity/sex, magic and properly executed action scenes. You know what i will be reading and don´t sleep on The Penisman by ISHIDA Sui as i am hardly a prude and only hate to waste my time with circle jerk nonsense as here. <br> 3/10 </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>tl;dr</br>  <br>I'm just confused as to what you're trying to achieve with your shit taste.</br>  <br>Get a load of this little bitch.

I wonder would they actually adapt it as it is or will they fuck it up by adding modern day shit to it?<br>Whenever they adapt old series it usually doesn't end well.</br></br>  ZERO shows, that I'm very excited for, a couple that I'm looking forward to.<br><br>Kill me.</br></br>  <br>Don't like Himouto?</br>  <br>Rev up that backlog</br>  <br>Honestly, nothing, but that's good since i wont be as dissapointed if some shows sucks.<br>That said i only expect TLR beeing super interesting as always.</br></br>   hype <br>Nothing really, but I'm going to try Shimoseka, Akagami no Shirayuki (although the manga didn't hold my attention before), Gakkou Gurashi, Dandelion and maybe Million Doll but I'm not expecting any of them to be particularly good, I'll probably drop a few after 3 episodes. <br><br>This doesn't look like a good season if you're not a Fatefag, Durarafag, Idolfag or degenerate horsepussyfag</br></br></br>  <br>i don't have a backlog, i watch every show every season</br>  I will watch God Eater anime for only one reason.  <br> Idolfag <br>Even that, seems like they're just trying to rip ideas of whatever popular idol shows are out right now yet most of them, like Aikatsu and PriPara are still ongoing so even if you are you would be watching the ones that are still airing.</br></br>  <br>Maximum hype :<br>Charlotte, NNB, Prisma Ilya, Working.<br>Hope it is good : <br>Zombie SoL and God eater.</br></br></br></br>  <br>jesus christ there's like 8 lesbian shows in one season.</br>  <br>Gay marriage finally got legalized recently.</br>  <br>Shimoneta<br>Prison school<br>Gate<br>Overlord<br>Ahoaru Kikan<br>Classroom crisis<br>Dumbire<br>NNB<br><br>That's it.<br>I'll probably drop half of them after 5 episode.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>postponed to august 14th</br>   gangsta  <br> Chaos Dragon: Sekiryuu Seneki  <br> Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace  <br> Aoharu x Kikanjuu <br> Joukamachi no Dandelion  <br> Ushio to Tora <br> Gate <br> Classroom Crisis <br> Durarara <br> Charlotte <br> Rokka no Yuusha <br> God Eater <br> Overlord  <br> Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou <br> Gakkou Gurashi! <br> Kangoku Gakuen  <br> Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya 2wei!

The results of their tabletop role-playing game sessions over six days created material for a seven-volume light novel series. </br></br></br>  Mixed in terms of how excited I am for each, but so far:<br>Fate/kaleid liner prisma illya 2wei Herz!<br>Dragon Ball Chou<br>Non Non Biyori Repeat<br>Akagami no Shirayuki-hime<br>Aoharu x Kikanjuu<br>Classroom Crisis<br>Gakkou Gurashi<br>Himouto Umaru-chan<br>Joukamachi no Dandelion<br>Prison School<br>Gangsta<br>Charlotte<br>Monster Musume<br>Sore ga Seiyuu<br><br>Leftovers:<br>Shokugeki no Souma<br>Ore Monogatari<br><br>Will most likely drop a lot of the things that aren't sequels though, especially with hardcoded cancer subs</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm hyped for nothing, probably the worst season for me in a few years.<br>I just hope the Laplace anime won't be total shit. Also Ushio to Tora may be a nice "retro shonen".</br>  Dont you want to go outside and enjoy summer?   I might since nothing really interests me    will have to wait for fansubs for most of the shows I'm watching <br><br>Having Funi in the anime industry is suffering.</br></br>  <br>learn moon</br>  In order of need:<br>Sora no Method OVA<br>Non Non Biyori Repeat<br>Yuru Yuri Nachuyachum!+ OVA<br>Himouto Umaru-chan</br></br></br></br>  The only show that starts today is Gangsta though.<br>Still looking forward to it though.

Most people didn't even understand what was going on, it was an eye rape most of the time.<br><br> Gakkou Gurashi! <br>Will have to wait until it catches up to the manga (probably 5 chapters min), since the manga updates mad slow but it's pretty good.<br><br> God Eater <br>Ufotable hyped this shit a lot, and they are probably doing another work so fast due to UBW ending and what to keep their name relavant until the UBW fad ends.<br><br> Prison School <br>No need to watch this since it will only cover when the guys are in jail, and I'll probably want to masturbate after each episode so I would rather save the time.<br><br> Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan <br>Guilty pleasure.<br> Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace <br>Anime original, deserves the 3 episode rule.

What are your thoughts on the new Jojo chapter?  <br>You just realized all this now?</br>  I wouldn't call him a genius but I'd say he's super creative and I really enjoy jojo because of that creativity.  <br>Yeah, he's not a genius by any means. He's not even that good of a writer. He really is super creative though.</br>  So anyone about this Jojo chapter, I really liked it because we know Gappy's  other half's real name,  finally  <br>It doesn't look like he has Josefumi's weird eyes, though.</br>  <br>Didn't he have both Kira's and Josefumi's eyes? I remember seeing a few panels of close-ups to his face, but perhaps that was just artistic? One of them that I remember was Karera looking close to him and realizing that he wasn't Josefumi. <br><br>Also, I remember it showing Kira's body without pupil's, but that could have been an edit I saw on here.</br></br></br>  <br>I just like how he alludes to past characters and stories in this new universe,</br>  <br>Gappy has 2 different eyes, but neither looks like Josefumis eyes</br>  <br>yeah it's kind of cool. In steel ball run the avdol one was pretty pathetic though <br><br><br>Hmm I'd have to look at the panels again. Why would Gappy have 2 different eyes and one of them not be the type that Josefumi had? Unless if Kira's and Josefumi's eyes mixed a little but not all the way.</br></br></br></br>  These subbers really annoy me with randomly putting words in quotes.  <br>Probably because Araki changed his mind about how Josefumi looks like</br>  <br>You mean translaters? But anon, that's how it is in the original text. It isn't random. Blame Araki</br>  <br>Hmm well let's see if newer panels have closeups of Gappy with his special eyes</br>  <br>Seen it in other manga, too. Toriko in particular. It's been really bad about that.</br>  <br>I think its fairly obvious they're translating the (can't think of a better word) expression from the raws, its not jusf some bullshit they're making up for funsies</br>  <br>Do you mean those "stand quote" things?</br>  <br>I think you're「Exaggerating」</br>  <br>He has his star birthmark though, which you can see kira doesn't have</br>  <br>Kira does have the birthmark. Don't you remember?</br>  <br>Yeah, but im trying to think of a word to describe/classify those things, i know the word exists just can't recall it</br>  <br>He doeen't have it here though</br>  <br>brackets?</br>  <br>Japanese quotes?</br>  <br>https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Japan<wbr>ese/Vocabulary/Punctuation</wbr></br>  <br> not even that good of a writer <br>Steel Ball Run</br></br>  <br>Probably just covered by the clothing. You can't see Josuke's one in every panel either.</br>  <br><br><br>call them stand brackets or just brackets. Corners would make more sense but sounds stupid<br><br> Japanese brackets <br> jabrackets <br>huh?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh so thats what they actually are</br></br>  <br>Shitty hair, and what is even going on with that shirt.</br>  <br>Damn you got me there</br>  Joubin's stand will wreck shit up    <br>You're right, but Karera kind of confirmed it. I'd bank on the other half being Josefumi. But even if the center isn't clear like Josefumi's one half is much lighter than the other.<br><br>The maid didn't know Josefumi, and he doesn't have the higashikata surname so his origins are the real confusing thing. Still don't really know anything about him.<br><br><br>He'll be the Wham, Karera will be the AC/DC, and Yotsuyu will be the Cars of the rockmen.  then Kira the other Kira/ Josefumi will come back as a rockman with killer queen like how Diego came back with the world </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>gay anime.</br>  When did math become so relevant  <br> He'll be the Wham, Karera will be the AC/DC, and Yotsuyu will be the Cars of the rockmen. then Kira the other Kira/ Josefumi will come back as a rockman with killer queen like how Diego came back with the world <br><br>None of what you're saying here makes any sense at all to me. Yotsuyu referenced Santana, Jobin referenced ACDC, Aishou referenced Wham, and Karera's name and design are references to Cars.<br>Also Josefumi and Kira are dead and other result of their fusion was a corpse that has been cremated.</br></br></br></br>  Why does Josefumi have the birthmark?  <br>Kira was cremated?</br>  <br>The corpse made of the parts of Kira and Josefumi that aren't now in Josuke, yes.</br>  <br>I don't remember that part so I assumed he was playing dead like a rockman.<br><br> the rest of what i said, i was just pretending to be retarded. </br></br></br>  <br>Are you reading Duwang on your first time through? Part 4's all redone. Not sure what you mean regardless, even Duwang is making it clear that Kira's doing calculations to hit Josuke.</br>  What happens if Araki explains the ghostly Josuke in part 8?  <br>English isn't your first language is it? That question is rhetorical. Its meant to be a joke on the fact that Geometry isn't super useful for most jobs.</br>  <br>I'm watching Dio's World while reading this thread, and the differences between Kira and Araki's other villains seem immense right now. He isn't really threatening because of inhuman powerlevel shit (as opposed to Dio, or Kars, or Pucci at the end), and even his huge powerup is really limited (as opposed to Valentine and Pucci).<br><br>The only thing that makes him scary is that he's clever. This and his goals make him the most human villain, despite him being a serial killer. I find pretty much all of part 4's characters to be far more relatable than those from the other parts.</br></br></br>  Whats the best Duwang? I like this one the best.  <br>This one</br>  <br>Reminder that Karera said he wasn't Josefumi, got spooked and tried to flee.<br><br>If he didn't use his stand to learn and call out her name she would of never continued their discussion.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, It could be a red herring. Araki would do it.</br>  Does /a/ like Shigechi? He was a fat greedy fuck but he wasn't evil and I was sad when he died. In the end he was just trying to protect his family and friends he didn't deserve to get blown the fuck up  <br>What's your point?</br>  <br>It's too accurate to be pure duwang, really.</br>  <br>Kira would have had his quiet life if not for this fat ass</br>  <br>If Kira really wanted a quiet life he wouldn't have gone around cutting peoples arms off</br>  Is Mista's gun part of his stand or does he just use a real gun?  <br>I believe it was a real gun, which makes me wonder what Sex Pistol's ability really was.</br>  <br>Sex Pistols is just another Harvest</br>   post yfw Araki introduces Stands based on the OST of the 2012-2015 anime in the next part.   <br>It's a real gun, he stole the six-shooter off a thug in his flashback, I think.<br><br>Sex Pistols is just a bunch of little fuckers who are really good at kicking bullets.</br></br></br>  <br>No, it's not like Emperor, the gun and the bullets are completely normal.</br>  Just read part 6.<br>What the fuck did I just read.</br>  <br>Evangelion version Araki</br>  <br>Make everybody happy</br>  <br> What the fuck did I just read. <br>No idea Mon, no idea, Part 6 can catch you off guard like that, s'like a spiked drink, your good for about five hours the OHBOYHERECOMESTHEABSINTHE! and you don't know where you are, what time it is, and why you feel like you've thrown up your legs and your arms have flown away.</br></br>  <br>[Cruel Angels Thesis] and [Tumbling Down]?</br>  I know this gets asked in every thread but any news on Part 4 anime?<br><br>Also I'm rereading it at the moment, has jojolion caught up with it or something because the translations and quality seem to be 10x better than when I read them before.</br></br>  <br>「S A C H I E L」</br>  <br>He's never properly seen the anime so that's unlikely.</br>  <br/>  How hard will it be to resist fapping to Mikan this season, /a/?  <br>why cant anime girls be real</br>  <br>Because we live in an imperfect world</br>  <br><br>She's worst girl and I'm not a pedophile so it will be very easy.</br></br>  How many pussy rito will see until he's not virgin anymore?  <br>Everybody's</br>  One page thread: No Edition Edition.
