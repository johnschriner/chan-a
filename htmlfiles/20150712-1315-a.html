[  Really like a girl in an anime <br> Look up porn of her <br> Can't get hard because it just doesn't seem right <br><br>I-Is this what they call...love?</br></br></br></br>  Yeah  <br>No, I think it's called impotency.</br>  You think you got it bad<br><br> Look up porn of anime character I like <br> can't get off unless it's a fat version of her <br><br>It's an abstract kind of hell</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chubby kind of fat or FAT fat?</br>  <br>Go back to wanking you sex crazed, loveless husk.</br>  <br><br>The chubby kind.</br></br>  <br>So what do I do next?<br><br>How do I make contact with this girl?</br></br></br>  <br>Post some.</br>  <br> Be me <br> Really like a girl in an anime <br> Look up porn of her <br> Can't get hard because she doesn't look the same when she's drawn by someone else and not the same studio which inherently triggers my autism and I'm not autistic   enough to be considered autistic. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I have literally the same reaction with her</br>  <br>How can you have a waifu if you can't even satisfy her? Can't even satisfy 2D. Pathetic.</br>  <br>Fam. I feel ya. Can't fap to anyone in Bebop, or Mitchiko e Hatchin or Berserk or so on. Hell I can't fap to my otps</br>  <br> Fam. I feel ya. <br><br>The fuck happened to /a/?</br></br></br>  <br><br> I don't want to see her nekkid because I love her so much <br>doing the same mistake with 2D you probably did with 3D <br> also if pic related is what you're speaking of you're a raging pleb </br></br></br></br>  <br> How can you have a waifu if you can't even satisfy her? Can't even satisfy 2D. Pathetic. <br><br>I'm saving myself until we meet in person. It feels wrong to masturbate to fake nudes of her. I'd rather wait to experience the real thing.</br></br></br>  Some characters are not meant for sexualizing.  <br> also if pic related is what you're speaking of you're a raging pleb <br><br>Actually the girl I'm talking about in the OP is Izana.</br></br></br>  <br>Twitter or something.</br>  <br>Love is a friend you want to fuck and trust, you're talking about worship.</br>  If you can't fap to her then you can't call her you're waifu.  <br>see<br/></br>  <br>And that's how your waifu finds you. There are more methods of a waifu finding you though.</br>  <br>How did you guys find your waifus?</br>  <br>See </br>  <br>I hate this. I want to do things with my waifu, but it wouldn't feel right because she is 14.</br>  <br> having a 14 year old as a waifu <br>That's why you make her you're daughteru, scumbag.</br></br>  <br>She's been my waifu since I was 16 you jackass.</br>  <br>Having pictures of nude 14 year olds from when you were 16 is still cp friend.</br>  <br> I don't have nudes or any lewds for that matter. </br>  <br>You play various media, some meet her in anime, some in manga, I met my own in VN's</br>  <br>Who's your waifu so I can draw her getting gangbanged?</br>  Can't fap if there aren't any lewds of your waifu anyway.<br> choosing a slut with lots of nudes as you're waifu </br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>I don't know why, but I don't like KLK porn<br>I guess Mako and Ryuko's for loving, not for lewds<br> Satsuki's for lewds </br></br></br>  <br>Probably Kirino or Yoko.<br><br>  you should draw it anyway  </br></br></br>  <br> not choosing a slut with lots of lewd as you're waifu so you can have a healthy marriage <br>What a faggot.</br></br>  I absolutely cannot fap to Revy. It's kind of weird.  <br>Not necessarily, but there are characters you enjoy so much generic porn doesn't work.</br>   Not feeling erotic attraction to your waifu <br>It's like you are subconciously admiting that you are a beta and she is forever out of your reach.<br><br> Chances are the same shit happened with your first 3DPD crush. </br></br></br>  So tell me.<br><br>Does the problem lie with your waifu? Or does it lie with you? <br><br>What's wrong? Do you feel you can't satisfy her, you're not good enough for her? She'd hate you if she met you?</br></br></br></br>  <br>but then 3dpd crush wanted to smoke my sausage pro bono, so what's my excuse?</br>   look up lewds of waifu <br> it's all gang rape and mind break <br> instantly go soft <br>fucking draw vanilla loving you fags</br></br></br>  <br>The latter, because they're most likely betafaggots.<br><br>I always fap to my waifu.</br></br></br>    <br>They respect their waifus too much to fap to art of them drawn by horny otaku</br>  <br>You're waifu's are massive sloots</br>  <br> the sad thing is i can actually get off to shit like ntr and mind break but it being my waifu is a deal breaker </br>  <br>Those aren't your drawings. I'm completely flaccid.<br><br>  I'm not even that waifu guy. What are you doing  </br></br></br>  Episode 2 in 4 hours  Rui´s legs are the miracle of universe.  <br>fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff<wbr>fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff<wbr>fffffffffffag</wbr></wbr></br>   you'll never trap a Rui with a lifesaver   <br><br> Dumb silver hoe stole my partner </br></br>   Katze sees Rui´s ruirui.   so why is katze in hajime's boobs? Did i miss something last season?  <br>Damn Katze getting handfuls of those big Hajimes.</br>  <br>Yeah, last ep DC version.</br>  <br> Katze feels Rui's ruirui </br>  <br> Katze bound to hajimes <br>I hope he'll get real screentime this season.</br></br>  I hope Rui wears that dress this ep.  It's still weird to me that this got a second season. I liked crowds, but it didn't really seem popular enough to get another season.  <br>In B4 they are traps too.</br>    I can't figure out if the new girl is the true genki character, and Hajimi is just the pretend Genki one or not.  I wish they went back to the discourse on anonymity and the positive and negative benefits of the internet anon army instead of braindead silver girls.  <br>New girl is a genki tomboy.</br>  <br>New girl is red ranger.</br>  <br>did you miss episode 00 or what?</br>  Never forget.  <br><br>Oh that would make sense then.<br><br>Who is blue? Black? Token pink?</br></br></br></br>  <br> all men wearing high heels. </br>   Waiting for Cthuko   When was the white knight such a chick magnet?  <br>He started producing more pheromones after he realized that he's gay.</br>  <br><br><br>Seeing art work like this really makes me wish Nakamura just went wild with colours in the show rather than keeping it relatively muted compared to his past works.</br></br></br>  <br>Katze might be one of the only characters I've seen that looks better with short hair. There's something endearing about his eyes we didn't see much of in S1</br>  <br>You wouldn't white knight Hajime?</br>  Why is the OP so catchy? http://galax.moe  these gatchas sure know what they're doing  What subs should I pick /a/?  <br>Whichever ones come out first.</br>  <br>Why they hold hands so much?</br>  <br>Not Commie, anything but Commie. They rape Hajime.<br>Cthuko if you don't mind waiting<br>Horriblesubs if you actually want to watch it when it comes out. These threads have a pretty high mortality rate, you'll get a few whenever an episode airs and that's it, so if you wanna watch with /a/ Horriblesubs it is and Cthuko (or AnimeNow if they do another release) for a rewatch.</br></br></br>  <br>Damn, I need to be gay too.</br>  <br>What about streams? Last year watching it with /a/ was fun, but this time nobody even made a thread for episode 1. Will the usual places (y or n) work?</br>  <br>White Knight Hajime will be an incredibly great catch. But it is even hotter because she is a pretender.</br>  <br>I have gotten into the habit of just downloading from Horriblesubs all my anime needs.<br><br>Terrible, I know.<br><br>Also, we need to mark the thread in a way that makes archive diving easy for the rest of us who could not make it to the threads.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, I'm not in all the sekrit clubs but Neetball doesn't have it on his schedule and episode 1 came out of nowhere because anichart fucked up and had it set for one day ahead. That + being a pretty niche show meant no one knew it was out until it was already out, and then subs came 30 minutes later.</br>  Tsubasa's Gatachaman color scheme looks like shit.  <br>Also Yucie is kill, forgot to mention</br>  <br>Isn't it akin to a gift we never expected?</br>  More importantly, why is grandpa's emotional bubble grey all the time too?<br><br>Is it wisdom? Or gives no fuck? Or looking down on the world?</br></br>  <br>It was a pretty fun day when it dropped, I'll admit. Episode 0 as well.</br>  <br><br>I could do a  stream  with the HS release if you guys would like</br></br>  So red crowds is basically /b/?<br><br>And normal crowds is /b/ when it is helpful?</br></br>  <br>That would be fun once the episode is out.</br>  <br>  :&gt;  <br><br>Also, that's the first time I noticed Paiman's avatar. Too cute.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought of Crowds as more like an over controlling facebook. There is really not that much anonymity when everyone on Crowds recognize Hajime.<br><br>And that raised the question of whether we should follow her example and become a bit more known on the internet to connect it with our real lives.</br></br></br>  <br>Me too. It's just so convenient.</br>  <br><br>Fun fact, that Ruirui was 3rd most liked pic of the day by males on pixiv.</br></br>  <br>Is Gatchaman that popular in Nip land?</br>  <br>It's just because it's by a really popular artist. I doubt even half of them liked it because it's Ruirui.</br>  <br>OTP</br>  <br>Oh. Too bad.</br>  <br><br>Definitely.</br></br>  <br>red crowds is /b/ and /pol/ while everyone else in blue is mix of everything.</br>   red crowds <br> VAPE <br>I guarantee you we're going to get a shot of their leader wearing a fedora before this is all over.</br></br>  <br>I am not so thrilled about the ill founded planet of the apes reference.</br>  IT'S ABOUT ETHICS IN SOCIAL MEDIA SUPERPOWERS  <br>Or something</br>  <br> Hajime will never drill you  r walls </br>  <br>You must be new.</br>  <br>Would call this handy man any day.</br>  <br>Gatchaman? yes<br>Gatchaman crowd? i'm not sure, but we got a second season because high rating</br></br>  <br>Can't get a high rating without being somewhat popular.</br>  <br>I wonder why she's covered in specks of white stuff. Maybe she  was doing herself. </br>  <br>Just not gatchaman movies?</br>  <br>The movie that Crowds was suppose to coincide with did rather shit actually.</br>  <br>Japanese anime-&gt;live action movies are always trash</br>  When the next episode comes out, I'll show it here:<br>http://galax.moe/stream</br>  <br> How to log in? I tried Baccano and that didn't work </br>  Watched the first episode finally. I like how JJ doesn't give two fucks anymore and forcibly transformed the new girl in front of camera crews.  <br>He means he'll add it to the main page, I assume.</br>  <br> secret </br>  <br>What is this and why does it asks me to log in?</br>  <br> you'll never eat rui up <br>why live</br></br>  <br>Oh god, I think VAPE has gotten to X, god help us all!</br>    <br><br>Wearing spats? Hell, Rui is know how to make me diamond hard.</br></br>    <br><br> there probably won't be an S3 <br> no more Rui after this season </br></br></br>  <br>I never dared to dream there'd be an S2 so I'm pretty happy.</br>  2 hours 30 mins until estimated release  With the absolutely shit lame ending of season 1, why are we giving this another chance?  <br>Because Hajime is a miracle of universe and anything with her in it is worth watching.</br>  <br>Because  Rui Rui </br>  <br>.... wow, that's actually valid.</br>  <br>Because traps sells.</br>  <br>Because critical opinion does not agree with yours.</br>  <br><br>Because Rui. He deserve the attention.</br></br>  <br>I want to see Rui being happy.</br>              <br>Didn't you watch the director's cut?</br>  <br>I can't stop laughing at Katz's expression as he forced to grab a handful of Hajime's Hajimes. I will be sad if they're forced to separate before the series is over.</br>  Katz manages to escape but takes Hajime's Hajimes with him.<br>Hajime is now flatchested.<br>How would you feel?</br></br>    <br>What kind of pantsu does he wear?<br>- shimapan?<br>- fundoshi?<br>- white ?<br>- no pan?</br></br></br></br></br>  I would only accept this if he sneaks into Ruirui and gives him breasts instead.  <br>Definitely something frilly and lacy, likely black.</br>  <br>Oh, hello, there, my other favorite trap. <br>See , but I think there was a Q&amp;A floating around about underwear, sleeping garments and swimwear.</br></br>  <br>In my head, shimapan or something lacy</br>  <br>Maybe we will find out if they finally decide to make a pvc release of his figure.</br>  <br>If somebody were to look at this screen cap without context they'd think it was yuri. Fun!</br>  <br>That ass, god damn.</br>  <br> his <br>Ff there isn't any built in bulge up the skirt it's whatever I want it to be</br></br>  <br>I have news for you</br>  <br>Please don't joke. This is a serious matter.</br>    <br>I will do everything in my power to bring Katze to justice and restore Hajime's hajimes.</br>  <br>Is dat....Rui´s ass / pantsu and...bulge??</br>    <br>I am very serious, my friend.<br>http://blog.livedoor.jp/toshigk/arc<wbr>hives/8206258.html</wbr></br></br>  <br>There's no way that's rea-<br> reverse search <br> it is </br></br></br>   Draw a girl <br> Call it a boy </br>  <br>my fucking D I C K</br>  <br>With Insight and Ranpo Kitan, what a great time to be alive.</br>  <br> That face </br>  <br><br>Dat wet look leather. It is like he asking for  intensive hugging .</br></br>  <br>Hajime's hajimes on one hand, but on the other hand Hajime is willing to share her Hajimes with everyone, I believe<br><br><br>It threatens to rip of your balls if you even think of hotglueing in its vicinity</br></br></br></br>  <br>I am sorry I ever doubted you. <br>My goddddddd.</br></br>  <br> dat bulge <br>MUST ...NOT ...FAP</br></br>  the thigh of a man is too erotic  <br>The directors cut was fine as an ending, although I do hope that we won't need another one of those this season and they'll actually finish the ending on time.</br>  I don't know, I think he should have painted them black or red. Rui seems like someone who'd coordinate.  <br> black or red panties <br>Come on, Ruirui is not a slut.<br>Pure white is always nice.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Red is for bitches.

So my speculah is that Tsubasa is gonna grow more and more frustrated with the fact she can't transform and Bane will use this chance to try and recruit her and force her transformation using the red crowds power so she can work for his cause  <br>Nah, Tsubasa will be used by Gel-chan, the true main villain of the season.</br>  <br>I think the voting just opened this episode</br>  <br>I am not saying Bane is final boss and whatever Tsubasa does Gel will follow anyway</br>  <br> Bane <br>You know what, fuck it. I'll just call that orange haired guy as Bane from now.</br></br>  <br>More like Gel will do something to anger Tsubasa with her powers and go out of control considering how Pai=chan and Troll acted when she showed up decked out in battle armor.</br>  <br>I pary for Hajime to never stop being Hajime, what a glorious autist.</br>  Gel Sadora was the Katze in the original Gatchaman 2, Gel-chan is obviously the main antagonist in Insight. And her big evil plan will be to "unite everyone into a single mind until no individuality is left" as a contrast to Katze's "divide everyone until they kill each other".  <br>Isn't Gelsadra  actually a daughter of Dr. Pandora  though?</br>  <br>I like the idea of Katze being the ultimate trumpcard to defeat Gel-chan.</br>  <br>YEEART</br>  <br>You could see her react to Hajime's grey bubble this episode. I wonder what's up with that</br>  <br>Gel Sadora was kidnapped as a little girl, forcibly aged up and brainwashed by Sosai X into becoming his new commander. And her backstory still isn't as fucked up as Katze being a kidnapped male athlete and a female genius student fused into a single body and brainwashed by Sosai X. They commit suicide at the end after realizing that they're a freak of nature.</br>  <br>Is the original series usually that dark and fucked up?</br>  <br>It's a weird mix of typical Tatsunoko Pro super hero fluff and fucked up dark shit.</br>  Hajime looks worse than S1  Oh, I just realized the reason for the cat ears on Rui's armor  <br> ipad <br>Rui uses a gen 1 Microsoft Surface Pro</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=W63<wbr>OizQpxtw</wbr>  [ ]  So what were the reasons /a/ gave for Hajime's grey bubble last week? Is something wrong with her? Does it represent how she remains unaffected by things? Is it Gel failing to grasp her as a person?  <br>The buttons on his suit's chest are also similar<br>Though still no idea why his suit has a cod piece</br></br>  <br>Notice that Grandpa was also grey.<br><br>I think it means she's enlightened.</br></br></br>  <br>And/or shut off emotion. Gramps lost his brother and still prays to him frequently..</br>  <br><br>My guess is that they have control over their emotions<br>Both Grandpa and hajime don't show their emotions, grandpa has a perpetual grumpy poker face and hajime has a perpetual "happy" face</br></br></br>  <br> Gramps lost his brother and still prays to him frequently.. <br>That's not really odd.</br></br>  <br>Perhaps, but they make a point of showing it a lot.</br>  <br> pure <br>not with those easy access panties, anon</br></br>  <br>But<br><br>Is that Rui a boy or a girl?</br></br></br>  <br>Why are nips so androgynous?<br><br>Also, is Katze doomed to be nothing more than a comic relief?</br></br></br>    <br>Katze will save the day once red alien girl goes out of control because of Tsubasa.</br>  <br> they actually made the ruimobile <br>it looks so small<br>in the show it looks like a lotus elise, but in this it looks much more Italian than British</br></br></br>  <br>Looks like a guy.</br>    I want to "do it" with Ruirui  HS is out.  <br>My dick is out too. I felt like sharing it with you guys.</br>  <br>Will stream here: galax.moe/stream</br>  <br> galax.moe <br>lel<br>How functional is this website?</br></br></br>  <br>That makes me curious if they'll ever do a reboot of Ken the Eagle and Speed Racer. Then again, Casshern Sins, Yatterman Night and Tekkaman reboot sucked donkey dick. Crowds is the only one of these that's actually watchable.</br>  <br>Sins was okay as a standalone.<br>The Casshern live-action was a real drag but it had good moments, still won't recommend it though.<br><br>Speed Racer live-action movie is great.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have future plans for it, but it's mostly under construction<br><br>Anyway, starting now with subs</br></br></br>   Hajime's Hajimes are back <br> Utsutsu's Utsutsus as well <br> Rui became a Gatcha and thus will have plenty of screentime <br> cute new girl with short hair <br> red alien loli <br> thanks to Berg-Katze, there's a close up of said Hajimes every now and then <br>I really am a happy man.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   I will never ssu the Hajime <br>My existence is pointless.</br>  <br>Thinking about how to break her.</br>  The VAPE guy just seems like he was butthurt because Rui was willing to use Crowds while he didn't have the balls.    So Katze probably gave Rizumi a corrupted note before but probably moved on to Rui when he wasn't willing to use it?  So what's wrong with Hajime?<br><br><br>Hajime stole Katze's NOTE and shoved it into herself.</br></br></br>  <br>Amen Break.</br>  <br>I don't think so, I don't think the timeline works because Katze had pretty much just arrived, while Rizumi seems to have been around for some time. Maybe Rizumi was an earlier Gatchaman who rejected JJ?</br>  <br>Too genki to accurately judge her feelings</br>  <br>The genki is an act.</br>  <br>Probably the same shit that's wrong with her.</br>  <br>How does he know Rizumi's name then?</br>  <br>RuiRui drives an electric car, what a fag<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Yp5<wbr>QgeKDVFo</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> bottled up depression behind her genki act <br> alien's feeling detector can't break past it <br> just like the grandpa's war horrors of his brother </br></br></br>  <br>It's probably more serious.<br>I'm partial to Hajime being an alien warlord who has come to earth to repent for her sins.</br></br>  <br>Didn't they say her character would be explored more this season?</br>  <br> we have never seen what her mother looks like or even heard her voice </br>  <br>She also moved in with the other Gatchaman like it wasn't a big deal to anyone.</br>  Not really feeling S2 so far but it's early days yet.<br><br>Are they really using S1 OST, Come on man.</br></br>  <br><br>I know he is a dude<br> but my dick just won't lissen, dam you Rui Rui! </br></br></br>  <br>There's a new CD coming out at the end of August. There's a few new tracks, but it's pretty obvious they'd reuse the old ones.</br>  Gelsadra is fucking terrifying to me.<br>That power to manipulate everyone's opinion like that feels wrong.<br>World peace utopia might be more scary than you're average bad guy plan.</br></br>  Sugayama is again the PM or who is this Shimizu?  <br>Because the characters are appealing. Also<br> I have a crush on Rui Rui </br></br>  <br>The new mayor, we don't care about him.<br>The mayoral election was just to introduce the idea of a smartphone election.</br></br>  <br> Casshern Sins sucked donkey dick <br>Huh, that's not an opinion you see everyday.</br></br>  <br>OH MAN</br>  Damn, is Katze going to be downgraded to joke of the week status?  <br>Why should he be anything else for now?</br>  <br>Fucking fatefags</br>  Oh my.  <br>How the babies will look like?</br>  <br>he could easily be the devil's on hajime's ear, tempting her<br>instead we just get him making some tempting sounding jokes and getting teamrocketed out of the screen</br></br>  Yep, she's an obvious villain. Simple world peace is too good to be true, probably some Instrumentality-type shit going on.  <br>It could well still happen.<br>Hajime will break this season.</br></br>  <br>And of course I forget the image.</br>  <br><br>Also, I really hate how fucking upbeat and enthusiastic all the people in this show's world are, it's pretty grating.</br></br>  <br>He did that in ep 00, he'll do it again sooner or later.<br>Doing it every episode would be pointless.</br></br>  <br><br>She sounds and looks like some sort of anti-Kaze.</br></br>  I want a Gel-chan.  <br> S1 <br> Moekane all the way <br> S2 <br> The moe is gone <br><br> S1 <br> Hajime genki and happy as fuck <br> S2 <br> happens<br><br>We'll slowly going to see her degrading and eventually breaking. I won't be able to take this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>With Katze shoved into her soul, Hajime breaking is probably gonna be extremely sudden.</br></br>  Wait, is the red alien thing male or am I being paranoid? The subs translate the way the characters refer to it as "her" but they say "aitsu" "koitsu" etc, which is gender-neutral (as far as I know).   Second best track from S1 playing <br>Thank you based Gatcha.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Z-v<wbr>tOKppCjc</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br>She's an alien. Might not even have a real gender.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its an alien life form, if its male or not doesn't really matter since their reproduction is probably incredibly different from ours</br>  I already said it, but I'm saying it again I love how big Hajime's tits are.  Gee, I hope Rui's seemingly good idea doesn't end up being a terrible idea.  <br>they were retarded big on episode 1, they fixed its shape and size on episode 2<br>now it looks more plausible she just has huge tits instead of some one using the transformation tool on Ps in her boobs</br></br>  <br>Electronic voting is nothing new, Brazil uses it for all its public voting, adapting it on a app for real time tracking is a really nice idea, but using the smartphones and tablets as a platform is just dangerous and unsafe, cant wait till it gets hijacked into electing bane's representative into the PM chair<br><br>Also, they gave away Nexus 7 tablets for every one that didn't have one, an you imagine the waste of money that was?</br></br></br>  <br>Fujos gonna fujo</br>  <br>The fact that other countries aren't using the crowds to wage wars on each other and now the Gatchamen and Aliens coming to Japan aren't setting off other countries makes this setting already ridiculously happy. It's like the people in this show aren't humans at all.</br>  <br>Is GALAX even worldwide, or just Japan only?</br>  <br>Japan only, but it's ridiculously strange how no other countries like China, Russia or America aren't trying to strong arm Japan into "sharing" this world changing tech or the powers of the Gatchamen.</br>  <br>Waging wars on someone else would just mean that others would use crowds to stop you anyway</br>  <br><br>Assuming GALAX is world wide, the CROWDS are private owned and available as a service for GALAX subscribers, and Rui can easily terminate this privilege in a heartbeat<br>Even if militaries just used it in war without asking him for it, Rui could just turn their accounts off since he doesn't want people associating the CROWDS with fighting<br>Basically, its not a reliable weapon considering the army has no actual control over it</br></br></br></br>  <br>How would you strong arm someone if they have a possible multiple million strong army of teleporting monsters? And if you nuke them you dont get shit</br>  <br>Because America would be okay with some japanese queer controlling the possible strongest weapon of humanity.</br>  Meh I really don't feel like watching another season about Rui's issues. I really hope it doesn't come to that.  <br>Gatchaman Crowds:Embrace explains the end.</br>  <br>Actually, how can a foreign government strong arm a private company?<br>Isn't that all kinds of international law violations?<br><br><br>Never said they would, but in the end they simply would have no control over CROWDS since rui still controls all blue ones<br>Its like wanting to use a gun that no matter how hard you pull the trigger it wouldn't fire because the creator on the other side of the world doesn't want you to fire it today, its unreliable as fuck as a war weapon</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is Rizumu a metaphor for SJWs?  Im not buying for a single second that Gel Saldra isnt anything but the villain. <br><br>Also is she a loli or a shota? Spic subs refer to it as a male.</br></br>  <br>Are you an idiot?<br>Rizumu is some weird mix between a conservative extremist and a gun control advocate.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't matter as long as it's cute.</br>  <br>does it matter?</br>  <br>Gel Sadra was female in the original Gatchaman. Katze was an hermaphrodite.</br>  <br>It's obviously going to be about Tsubasa since Gel-chan is the new Katze.</br>  Seeing this episode i think the main theme of this season will be about having conflict or not having conflict at all. You have BANE using crowds to wreck shit to prove crowds can wreck shit in bad hands, and you have Gel Sadra which seems to be unable to stand conflict of any kind and will try to unify everyone.  I need at least one doujin with Bane gangbang.<br><br>Come on, with that voice, that smug face. He's asking for it.</br></br>  <br>I would unify with Gel.</br>  <br> Fuck the CROWDS? </br>  <br> green earrings on both ears <br>yup he is a faggot</br></br>  <br>More like  Fucked by the CROWDS </br>  <br><br>I want a Gel getting gangbanged by a hundred crowds instead. True union.</br></br>  Tomato-chan a shit  <br>The seemed to like one another though.</br>  <br>Don't bully Gerurururu.</br>  <br><br><br>It's nothing but a ruse</br></br></br>  <br>So is it basically confirmed that she can only transform when she's really angry? What's up with that?</br>  <br>Why is Crowds so gay?</br>  <br>Everyone wants Silver</br>  <br>Because the purest form of love</br>  <br>Not to mention that the other countries would probably want to wait and see whether this turns out to be a boon or a fiasco. I mean the very first entrance of CROWDS did almost lead to the government being overthrown</br>  Around my city I've been seeing VAPE signs around. Am I safe from the VAPE?  Hajime with her constant smile kinda creeps me out at this point. Particularly in that scene in the end when Tsubasa bows to her and she just looks with those gray eyes, smiling and saying nothing.  <br>Erection time?</br>  <br>She's giving me a weird feeling too, like she's really pissed or something.</br>  How many ice cream puff sandwiches does it take to develop and maintain such voluptuous hajimes?  The lack of Sugane screen time is criminal. I really fucking hate how 2nd seasons of original shows always abandon the characters we grow to love in order to shove some new piece of shit that will never be as interesting as the original cast down our throat because the writers are shit. Fuck Tsubasa, I fucking hate her.  So what's the deal with OD?<br><br>Didn't he die, they made a huge deal out of it, showing him bleeding and all.</br></br>  <br>Nah, he just got his shit all fucked up.</br>   In between Gel's legs <br>Tsubasa is the lewdest gatchaman.</br>  Is Hajime going to reach some kind of breaking point this season?  <br>And luckiest.</br>  <br>yes, katze-tan will take over.</br>  <br>Even if it happens, it won't be anything serious. Pretty much nothing can disturb the power of genki and Hajime in particular.</br>  <br>She's relieving her stress on Katze</br>  <br>I see. She's really smart.</br>  <br>That's because Hajime is broken and cynical.<br>She simply pretends to be endlessly happy. Before becoming a Gatchaman in Season 1, she was bored to shit but the moment she was touched by JJ, she sprang to life and for adventure.<br>She's also full of keikaku. The fact that her emotions are grey shows that she's either zen or dead inside.</br></br></br>  <br> "Don't spread your wings" <br> Goodbye Utsutsu <br> Shown bleeding all over <br> "This is how it ends" <br> Sendoff works great for him <br>Jesus, he dodges deathflags almost as well as this fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  If I could just fucking remember my centuries old philosophers correctly, I could articulate this better, but rather than - in addition to - "having conflict vs. having no conflict", I think this season will be about the competing visions of human nature espoused by Rizumi and Rui. Rizumi will be the representative of the likes of Hobbesian cynicism, and Rui will be the opposite anarchistic idealism. We saw this in the first season somewhat before Katze and the Neo-Hundred and Hajimessu ended up dismantling in Rui-rui's "THE WORLD WILL BE UPDATED VERY SOON" spiel. Hajime, after some kind of Katze-induced breakdown, will re-emerge as being the happy medium option.<br><br>I do wonder if Joe will ever shoot anyone, though.</br></br>  <br>Rizumi looks more like a mid-boss character while Gel-chan is the final boss.</br>  <br>He survives, it's shown in the Director's Cut of episode 12</br>  I just don't get it. How can one girl be so perfect? I want to hug her tightly.  What's going on with these 2?  <br>Gay undertones of love.</br>  <br> perfect <br> permanent gray bubble <br>try again</br></br></br>  <br>If Gel-chan is indeed looking to unite all human thought and erase individuality or whatever, she could easily be a stand in for The Leviathan, Rizumi's equivalent of it.</br>  <br>They're faggots</br>   people actually like Hajime <br><br>I don't get it. She is the worst thing about the show, bar none. There's no depth to her. She's an always right girl so xD random she might as well be holding a spook in every scene.</br></br>  <br> :&gt; </br>  Why is she so perfect?  <br>They're giving Sugane someone to go to once Tsubasa NTRs him for Hajime</br>  <br> depth meme <br>Next you are going to talk about ``character development'', won't you?</br></br>  <br>Are you kidding?<br>She's literally the sole reason to watch the show.<br><br>If the only thing you can see in her is ''always right random xD girl'' you really haven't paid attention to the first season at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br> snip snip <br> snip snip <br>this can only end well</br></br></br>  <br> She's literally the sole reason to watch the show. <br><br>you mean Rui right? genki-chan got old fast in season 1.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, Rui is also one of the major reasons to watch Season 1.</br>  <br>Well, those two have certainly become one.</br>  <br>She's not perfect.<br>There is something very wrong with her.</br></br>  So the good guys are the normalfags using facebook and spending their life UPDATING their status while the bad and evil guys are the intellctual ones?<br><br>Yea should have figured that one.</br></br>  <br> The genki is an act. <br>I don't think it's an act. The line in your pic is just Hajime worrying that after she shoves Katze inside her, she won't be the same anymore. This just proves that she's got worries, not that her happiness is a facade.</br></br>  <br>why is her bubble gray?<br><br>also, i would like to see rui's bubble</br></br></br>  <br>this is AOTY right here.</br>  <br>Because Hajime-tan so based. Enough to not get effected by Gel-chan's mind manipulations.</br>  <br>old guys bubble was gray too.</br>  <br>No, the good ones are the ones using idiot facebook people who play farmvilles for points, while the the evil ones are the anti-gun activist going all ''look how dangerous guns are, let me demonstrate it by shooting up a few malls''.<br><br>The genius of the Crowds is that everyone having one makes wars obsolete since it's a power everyone can have and is self-regulated by stupid facebook games.<br>And that orange haired faggot is just being a faggot because people can abuse the system.<br><br><br>Go watch the first episode of Season 1, look at Hajime before JJ finds her.<br>It's all an act.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because he's based too.</br>  <br>Same thing with him</br>  <br>is this animay as deep as everyone makes it out to be? or is this some new level of faggotry?</br>   I'm an idiot who didn't realize Gel was voiced by HanaKana until this week <br>That explains why Gerurururururur~ got stuck in my head so instantaneously.</br>   making red loli cry and throwing her aside <br>REMOVE VAPE<br>REMOVE BANE</br></br>  <br> Go watch the first episode of Season 1, look at Hajime before JJ finds her. <br> It's all an act. <br>That's just Hajime being Hajime. Is it really so hard to believe she's genuinely happy and bubbly but also smart enough to be concerned about what's going around her?</br></br></br>  <br>why didn't loli go gatcha instead of just running in like an idiot?</br>  <br> Being fooled by her acts </br>  <br>But Leviathan doesn't stand on unity but obedience to the monarch and relinquishing a portion of one's rights to it in order to escape from the natural state of war. It's similar, but not quite same.</br>  <br> is this animay as deep as everyone makes it out to be? or is this some new level of faggotry? <br>It has some interesting themes going on, if that's what you mean by "deep."</br></br>  so gel can absorb people's feelings via the bubbles??<br><br>I fear she is going to get kidnapped by red crowds and force fed their bubbles.</br></br>  do hajimessssu's hajimes lactate??  <br>But if Gel-chan is the one who'll be directly altering their thoughts in order to escape the natural state of war, then it's basically the same thing, since humanity would naturally be relinquishing the right to any individuality and thereby become perfectly obedient.</br>  <br>Please forgive me.<br><br>My dick chose to believe in her, and he's never been wrong so far.</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much no anime is deep, with some very minor exceptions.</br>  <br>It discusses uncommon themes, but they're very blatant about it, so I wouldn't call it deep.</br>  <br> not liking autism chan <br><br><br>Jou pushing Sugane's homo buttons<br><br><br>It's grey because of either a.) autism or b.) she is too pure and care free to be read or affected by outside influences/manipulations.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Decide for yourself.<br>I really enjoyed the shit out of Season 1.<br>There's a very good amount of commentary of social network, what it means to be a hero, etc.<br>I honestly this Gatchaman nails down the human condition perfectly in Season 1 with a bit too much optimism at the end but meh.<br><br><br>I'm not saying that she's faking it or that she's just a brooding person pretending to be happy, just that she shows to be bored of her life in ep 1 of Season 1 and goes actually full genki once she becomes a Gatchaman. But her persona of being cautious and smart still remains.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did someone make a webm of this yet?</br>  <br>I can make one if you'd like.</br>  <br>No thanks, just asking.</br>  <br>Can you please?<br><br><br>You're mean.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not the guy you're asking, but I'd appreciate it if you did.</br>  <br>How am I mean? If he wants to do it, then do it instead of fishing for people to beg him to.</br>  <br>Thanks. I've been looking for that since my HD crashed, but everything on the archive is dead.</br>  <br><br>Maybe Rui's will be red, or whatever the opposite of grey is</br></br>  <br>The opposite of grey is just a different shade of grey.</br>  my attempt  <br>It's funny you say red, because if you look at Hajime's note closely, you'll notice it's not just white anymore. Now it has some red in it too.</br>  While I believe in the triumph of genki I don't really see it going smoothly. When you think about it, we're just at episode 2.5 and the situation is already beyond explosive. You have intelligent, but cynical/misanthropic guys from VAPE; good-willing (and dangerous in that quality) guys from CROWDS who already show their willingness to use power; their heavily idealistic dictator; Sugayama, with his entire politics based on something new and unstable; Gel, who is a huge disaster waiting to happen (disregarding her motives); and Hajime ramming Katze in her head.<br>The fact that Hajime is known to go very far when she deems it necessary doesn't help much.</br>  Why is Gel-chan so cute?<br><br>Also, did that one use of Gel-"kun" by the reporter on stage bother the fuck out of anyone else?</br></br>  <br>This ep had a lot of quality but him not having a pupil here got me the most. He had a pupil in (his) right eye in just the previous shots.</br>  So, the city in WA that Rizumin moved to and back from has a sister city in Japan, Yao.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao,_<wbr>Osaka</wbr></br></br>  <br>it looks like she is not wearing any bra</br>  <br>All the Elevens in the stream were commenting on it, too, so yes.</br>  <br>Katze will never want Hajime breaking though. Despite what he outwardly says, you know he's enjoying all the fun things he and Hajime is doing. He's a hardcore tsundere for Hajime now. He'll probably give her a pep talk when things are at its bleakest or something.</br>  doesnt hajime have reality warping powers  <br>Hajime has the power of Designer Note, the ability to design anything imaginable and make it a reality. It's not quite reality warping but more of the power of creation. But considering how Hajime really is, I guess there really is no difference between the two.</br>  <br>According to the series' website, she can transform anything into whatever she can imagine. But she has never used this power in the show itself except to turn the cubes into Notes.</br>  <br>But the might of the sovereign comes from the consent of all his subjects, who can naturally revolt, but then they'll be putting themselves in the role of the enemy. Gel-kun doesn't really have anyone's consent as they don't fully know what she is doing. Besides, she doesn't quite fit the picture of a sovereign (I think. She doesn't look like she'd be able to protect them from, say, Berg. But I might be wrong.) and the society she's in isn't in the state of perpetual war. They already have a leader and laws.</br>  <br>I believe she used it implicitly throughout the show. Like when she used her scissors to initially communicate with Messy by touching it. Or when she was able to 'cut out' Katze from the hearts of the people and then transform Katze into a Note to fuse him into her.</br>  Rather than mid-boss, BANE's terrorism will be the one to trigger Gel-chan's decision of unifying everyone on Earth.  <br><br>So bane pushes Gel over the edge, she goes full mass control to make every one happy all the time, all gatchas but hajime included, hajime is underpowered and endups releasing Berg, who will endup saving the day by being the big bad Gel cant beat but being something hajime has under a leach</br></br>  <br>I reckon that VAPE will be using their monkey antics to invoke the specter of Hobbes' state of nature, though, and Gel can certainly protect her "subjects" if she has her gullible Gatchaman minions do her dirty work. Also, in an untranslated spot in the OP (pic related, at least according to another anon), one of the options is "leave it to Sadra", meaning Gelsadra, so this could mean people voluntarily give up their ability to choose during the parliamentary elections and allow Gel to choose for them. As such, if she obtains a controlling stake in parliament, she would effectively rule the country via consent. Pai-pai is certainly setting her up for that by continuing to push the idea that she could be a savior, idiot that he is.<br><br>Plus, Berg couldn't do jack if Gel instrumentality'd humanity, because he can't wreak enough havoc to destroy the planet on his own. His entire MO is manipulating species into civil wars to kill themselves, and that wouldn't work if everyone's thoughts were united. Berg has likely seen this happen on other planets before, which is why he knows of and dislikes her, since to him she would have been a buzzkill.<br><br>By the way, Hobbes says you're not allowed to revolt against the sovereign because you gave the sovereign the absolute right to act for you and the sovereign can therefore never be in the condition of having broken the covenant, no matter what.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Q&amp;A said he wears cute briefs.</br>  <br>Gel-chan has already done that to other planets.<br>I think they'll rely on Gel-chan to defeat VAPE but that will backfire on them severly.</br></br>  <br>it's a face that says "I know what you're planning to do to me, and it's disgusting"</br>  <br>Isn't "-kun" sometimes used for girls too?</br>  <br>Only in specific circumstances, like a "superior" talking to someone under them in a professional environment, I believe. Which this wasn't one of those times.</br>  <br>That also works.<br> this is what you wished for, isn't it? </br></br>  <br>She's like a prestigious guest though, so you'd want to be extra polite.</br>  <br>Well, the whole 'leave it to Sadra' thing is against the law, unless she officially joins the elections, and that is a thing that ought to be punished. Nevertheless, at the same time she'd receive the consent of the majority, so I suppose that would make her, while not the official PM, the actual sovereign. I think that if it would come to that, she and the PM would have to duke it out or something. That said, given her influence, the PM would probably give up his position to her anyway, though how willingly is up to anyone's guess. <br><br>About Berg - maybe by kissing people he could get into their subconsciousness and snap them out of Sadra's influence, though it does seem like his powers don't reach quite as many people simultaneously as Sadra's. <br><br>And Hobbs also says that anyone who professed that they will no longer be subjected to law are declared Enemies. If you renounce the law you renounce the sovereign, which makes it a revolt.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Which probably means that the Gatchas will need Berg's help to take her down.</br>  <br> Implying he doesn't look like a boy even in full drag with makeup.  <br><br>Hes one of the only traps like that to.</br></br></br>  <br>Fair enough, it still just felt really off to me.</br>  GERURURURURURURURURUR  <br>Will she speak lots of Engrish as well?</br>  <br>Well Japanese PMs are directly selected by the Parliament/Diet, so it's not like Sugayan would really have a say in the matter if Gel obtained 51% of the seats in the House of Reps:<br><br> ...the House of Councillors has almost no power at all to prevent the lower house from selecting any Prime Minister it wishes. Furthermore, once appointed it is the confidence of the House of Representatives alone that the Prime Minister must enjoy in order to continue in office. The House of Representatives can overrule the upper house in the following circumstances: <br> [...] <br> 3. If both houses cannot agree on a candidate for Prime Minister, even through a joint committee, or if the House of Councillors fails to designate a candidate within 10 days of House of Representatives' decision, then the nominee of the lower house is deemed to be that of the Diet. <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan<wbr>ese_Diet</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Vegeta experiences the greatest hell<br><br>Fun.</br></br>  I wonder how this will go...

Vegeta trying to be a father while keeping a completely straight face was pretty fun.  shortest 30 minutes of my life tbh  Next episode will have Bulma's birthday party, we are on BoG already, I thought they would do more filler before. I hope they expand on the party and give us all the scenes there at least, I want Pilaf to be there again.  <br>Espera por la pelicula anon</br>  Shit that was a good episode. But is it just me, or did last week's episode feel a lot longer?  Niggers and Spics mad as fuck.<br><br>WHERES MUH EPIK BATTLESSSS</br></br>  What's so special about King Kai's planet that Goku loves to train there?

I think there was more action in it, as low key as it was for Dragon Ball, so it felt longer than this which had a lot more dialog between Vegeta's family and Beerus/Whis/hohoho</br></br>  <br>I don't know where people get this from. It's blue at the very beginning, and it's blue more often than it's purple.</br>  zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  <br>It's 24 minutes</br>  <br> Watching a battle shonen  <br> Wishing for it to be SoL  <br>How dumb, just go and watch a Sol anime.</br></br></br>  <br> Beko <br>Spic pls. You know damn well his name is Jaco.</br></br>  <br>I think it only felt longer because it had the scene with the kids adventure while this one jumped from scene to scene every 2 min. <br> Plus the lack of animation </br></br>  <br>that wasn't colored by toriyama</br>  <br>Goku lived with king kai longer than with Chichi</br>  <br><br>yeah but the beams were faster so it took more effort.. .nigga do u even toriyama?</br></br>  Oh god, Vegeta looks so off here<br><br><br>Leaked TV schedule</br></br></br>  <br>If I ever met a King Kai in my life I'd just live with him forever.

Toriyama drew her hair with purple at the beginning</br>  <br>That's a flashback scene from Z. The difference between hand drawn and digital is really jarring.</br>  <br> hating fun </br>  <br>The footage is third generation through original + Kai. 80s QUALITY doesn't help either.</br>  <br>King Kai is his most recent mentor.<br><br>Notice how in RoF he instantly ditches him for Whis.</br></br></br>  <br>That's from the original DBZ anime.</br>  <br> That's a flashback scene from Z <br>I know (actually I think it's from Kai). I'm saying in that episode he looked really off. Look at his upper body</br></br>  <br>I want to cuddle a Jaco</br>  <br>Digital is worse</br>  <br>Fuck back to /v/</br>  RAW fucking where  <br>He was training.

Yeah her hair is purple some of the time, but not any more often than it's blue. It's even red that one time.</br></br>  <br>I want an arc where Vegeta's brother joins the Galactic Patrol and has to deal with their anti-Saiyan discrimination.<br><br>Also an arc where Videl can't be Gohan's sidekick so Jaco fills in for her. Or just have Jaco takeover the Great Saiyaman role for awhile when Gohan is off with Goku and Vegeta and the Gods doing shit in Universe 6.</br></br></br>  upload the raw you sissy sluts  <br>I dont like this new Beerus.<br><br>He's too evil.</br></br></br>  <br>I know he blew up planets and killed a ton of people but did he deserve it?</br>  <br>Amerikajin cannotto inutu nemusu<br> Zey carr Biirusu-sama "Rord Beerus" <br>Zey do nottu getto za refurensu!</br></br></br>  <br> saying Freeza the correct way <br> still saying Bills like a fucking faggot <br>How abstract are you?</br></br></br>  <br> Is this a recolor too? <br>Yes.

The blue hair also appears in one of the tankoubon covers. Maybe Toriyama had a change of heart about the hair color?</br>  Is the raw up yet?  <br>Which chapters were originally colored by Toriyama?</br>    <br>http://www.asahi.com/culture/update<wbr>/0329/TKY201303290330.html<br> What areas did you expand from the suggestions on Beerus’s concept, having an aspect of greed with regards to food, and his cat-like visuals? What is the origin of Beerus’s name? <br>"Beerus, God of Destruction, was in the the story outline I was shown in the beginning, but things like the character concept, I ended up completely changing. With his being greedy with food, as well, I was aiming for the amusing gap with this fearsome being called the God of Destruction. As for his visuals, when I was thinking of a pattern for an enemy I hadn’t drawn in the past, the family cat caught my eye, and I thought I’d go with that. (It is a breed called a Cornish Rex; a bit of a rare cat, which is not popular in Japan.)<br><br>The name Beerus, I used as-is from the story outline. Anyway, it’s apparently a name that was taken from “virus”, but I mistakenly thought it came from “beer”, and gave his attendant the name “Whis”, which I took from “whiskey”. (Shueisha gives a supplemental explanation that officially, “Beers” comes from “beer”, and “Whis” from “whiskey”.)"<br><br><br> Actually quoting the Dragon Ball wiki <br>You know that place is quite frequently wrong right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Just download the Daizenshuu 1 and the manga scans</br>  <br>Bills is an accepted translation too. Funimation wanted to keep Beerus to be as close as possible to the original japanese and avoid horrible name changes like in the past</br>  So, is the stream over?<br><br>How was the episode?</br></br>  <br>Chat was dead so don't worry, you missed nothing</br>  <br>He did 300 to train for the Androids.</br>  <br> Funimation wanted to keep Beerus <br>Toriyama literally said that he thought it came from the word Beer</br></br>  Raw's up boys.  <br>Dragonball: Path to Power movie</br>  <br> quoting any wiki at all <br>These people are asking to be ridiculed</br></br>  <br> quotes http://www.kanzenshuu.com <br><br>You really have no right to quote the wiki as a bad source now</br></br></br>  <br> new Beerus. <br> He's too evil. <br>Did you see the movie?<br>He was going to destroy the Earth over pudding, he is the same as ever.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>There is an image of Bulma with purple hair going into the Cell Saga. <br><br>Also same thing happened with Piccolo and his arm skin. They are supposed to be yellow and now pink.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the difference is that he had 50 lasers shooting at him this time. When he did the 400g he was just trying to maintain control of his body.</br>  <br>Short but hilarious</br>  <br>Based on what Toriyama says in interviews, he doesn't really think about colors too much and just does it based on what he feels like.</br>  <br>That's like the only time her hair is purple in official material. Personally, I've always liked it<br><br><br>What's wrong with Kanzenshuu? They actually translate shit like this to prevent shit like this argument from happening. And I posted the link to the news article where it's from so you can check yourself where it's literally said.</br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Bu7<wbr>muZaoTUQ</wbr>  [ ]  <br>He didn't actually do it though.<br><br>This new Beerus would.</br></br></br>  <br>What the actual fuck? Things like the impalement scene weren't even in the edited version, which was all the kiddies had access to back then.</br>  <br>But King Kai isn't going on the great space adventure.</br>  <br> He didn't actually do it though. <br>He only didn't actually do it after Goku had proven himself (also Earth food being delicious). The same would happen here.<br><br>I mean the only reason he's blown up the other worlds was because of food issues, just like in BoG</br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestamente el anon esta equivocado, no le decimos bills, le decimos Beerus pero en formato ingles el cual suena como Bills. <br><br>Translation<br>We dont call him Bills, we call him Beerus but in english so it sounds like Bills.</br></br></br></br>  I kind of want to fuck Beerus  <br>Their translations are shit and they think the guidebooks from the 90s are canon to the story.</br>  <br>I feel like this new Beerus would do it anyway.</br>  <br>But anon, spic actually got The first part of DB before getting the second one.<br>Unlike you USA</br></br>  <br>Yes that does sound like Bills but it's not actually spelled that way because it ruins the alcohol pun that Whis and Champa have</br>  <br>Champa's cuter.<br><br>Except for his tail. His tail looks stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>You're not saying this is going to end with him blowing up the Earth are you?<br><br>Everything Beerus has done in the show so far has been in character from what we've seen. We're just actively seeing him being a destroyer this time.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah he won't. They make it a big deal that Beerus changes his mind after meeting and fighting Goku.</br>  <br>Of course, it's spelled Beerus, we spanish folk know this. but there's always that one idiot.<br><br>also everyone loves Beerus</br></br></br>  <br>Will he spawn a lot of bara furry fanart?</br>  <br>At least this means they didn't throw away all their old footage.</br>    <br> Doesn't know the Harmony Gold dub of the Pilaf Saga aired on American TV before Toonami got DBZ <br>It was on my local WB at 5 AM in 1995 or 1996. Several small affiliates aired it across America.</br></br>  This is where Vegeta will get the idea for the dance from<br><br><br>Of course. How could you not love Beerus</br></br></br>  <br>When hes being goofy, not when hes being an asshole.</br>  <br><br>I guess it doesnt mater much anyway since he'll become a "good guy" soon enough.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure this is Kai footage. I mean I could be wrong but I am pretty sure it is Kai. It has the tint<br><br><br>He makes a lot of sense when you realize he's literally a cat. Their moods jump around a lot</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ive only seen one piece of fanart of him, a picture of him naked. And it was censored. I've seen nothing else at all.</br>  <br>DEEPEST LORE!<br><br><br>He's only goofy when food is involved. Remember, he blew up a star in the RoF manga because Whis, Goku and Vegeta were too loud in their training when he was trying to sleep.</br></br></br></br>  <br> If you keep giving me those dishes, stay with me, I will protect you from everything. <br><br> Everyone goes by his side trying to get protected, even Gohan. </br></br></br>      <br>mah boy , BOG beerus is a loveable Asshole like eddie guerrero , Super beerus is going to be the same because japan loves that purple cat</br>  <br><br>Japanese write it as "Bills", but it'a clearly a pun from "Beer" like Toriyama stated.<br><br>This is simply just another Bulma = Buruma or Kuririn/Kulilin/Krillin case.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her hair is almost always purple. That cover and the first chapter are the only instances were she had blue hair.</br>  We need more Beerus, period  <br><br>P O R K I N G I T U P<br>O<br>R<br>K<br>I<br>N<br>G<br><br>I<br>T<br><br>U<br>P</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Beerus wanted to blow up planet Vegeta <br> Freezer had to ask for permission  <br> Beerus allowed him to do so </br></br></br>  <br>We need more of everyone who isn't named Goku or Vegeta. Seriously, put them on a bus for awhile and let everyone else shine.</br>  <br>I haven't seen the episode yet, but based on the screen caps I'm assuming Vegeta is finally delivering on his promise to take Trunks to the park?</br>  <br>"I wanna eat this dinosaur aw nevermind fuck it Im just gonna kill you all." motivation annoys me no matter what the character.<br><br>I still do like Beerus but some better writing would go a long way.</br></br></br>  <br> Pokemon meets Pulp Fiction <br>The closest thing that's sounds like it is Narutaru... Dragon Ball is prequel to Narutaru! Knew it!</br></br>  Raw is out  Vegeta family is best family<br><br><br>Yes. He remembers the promise and flashbacks on that scene from Z</br></br></br>  <br>Plus, Trunks and Bra's hairs makes a lot more sense.<br><br>Because , yes, Bra's hair is also Lavender/Purple.</br></br></br>  <br>Yup. He takes that nigga to Disney. Niggas love Disney.</br>  <br>Vegeta confirmed to be stronger than Goku now</br>  <br>What'd you think the sex is like? I imagine Vegeta just goes "Woman, I'm horny" and proceeds to use her as a dicksleeve without smiling for a single second.</br>  <br>Cute little nipples.</br>  I remember Trunks  <br>Oh man, I totally forgot about that. Well done.</br>  <br>On all of the limited color pages her hair is close to the anime color.</br>  <br>Why is the dragon dildo radar red?</br>  <br>That's not what happened</br>  <br>Because coloring was never consistent in the manga.</br>  <br>eh Beerus did wanted to destroy planet Vegeta according to Whiss</br>  <br>But those are color pages made years after the manga finished</br>  Beerus destroying the planet in episode 1 because it was too greasy instead of doing it because the aliens poisoned it (like in the manga) was a good change because it fits the character more.  <br>Where?</br>  <br>If they split up in their search for the Super Dragon Balls, there should be plenty of chances for other characters to shine.</br>  <br><br>He's actually  submissive during sex and lets her do anything to him, but always has a frown while she tries to please him. When she manages to make him like it somehow, he goes full tsundere. </br></br>  <br><br>It was more like Beerus wanted to blow it up and Freeza already wanted to do it too so he was like "Hey man, take care of this for me" "Yeah, cool".<br><br>Freeza was probably always going to blow up Vegeta, Beerus just had him do it quicker</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tien shinhan is such a fucking beta<br><br>Instead of ramming launch he isolates himself in the mountains and punches rocks all day with his weird albino clown midged friend</br></br></br>  <br>the first chapter was colored by Toriyama when it originally came out, Toriyama doesn't give three shits about hair color when the character isn't a dark-haired saiyan</br>  <br>Do you have a citation for that?</br>  <br> niggers and spics <br> not murricans </br></br>  <br>I have a DXF that says Beers, but who the hell trusts Bandai with English? They spelled Freeza two different ways in the same line of figures, and have kept this spelling for Krillin for more than 20 years.</br>  <br>Yeah but they never said he interacted with Freeza at all about planet Vegeta. Whis just mentioned that Beerus wanted to destroy it "as well" (according to the official subs) at some point.</br>  <br>It would've made sense either way, but the poison would be more justifiable. Id prefer the poison.</br>  <br>Couldn't be more wrong. Whis even explains why Goku always has an edge over him.</br>  <br><br>Why is Vegeta the best dad?<br> Sticks around <br> Trains his son <br> Keeps his promises </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He isn't a beta, he's a sage musclewizard</br>  <br>I'm guessing they used a limited palette to make printing cheaper. There's only about 3 or 4 different colors on the page.<br><br><br>The color pages come from the "perfect edition" of the manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Agreed</br>  <br>You got Freeza right, but Beerus wrong? wat</br>  <br>Honour</br>  <br>I don't give a shit what was written, but the design layout looks good.</br>  <br> Tien shinhan </br>  <br> its not like i like this ice cream or anything! </br>  <br> Killyn <br><br>Goddammit Bandai...</br></br></br>  <br>thats why hell never surpass goku</br>  <br> Toriyama doesn't give three shits about hair color when the character isn't a dark-haired saiyan <br>that seems to be the case...<br><br> but the poison would be more justifiable. <br>that's the problem, it was justifiable. Wouldn't you be angry if someone tried to kill you?<br>disliking the greasy food is more petty, it makes it more obvious that he gets easily angered</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>please for the love of god don't link the DB wiki, it's fucking godawful</br>  <br>Actually Tenshinhan has a farm</br>  <br>murricans calls <br>mr satan "hercule" <br>tenshinhan as "tienshinhan" <br>chaozu as "chiatzu" <br>kaioshin as "king kai"<br>pikkoro as "piccolo"<br>what's your point?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>pussy clouds the mind</br>  <br>tenshinhan, tien, ten-san, ten-chan ten-nine-eight-seven whatever you want to call him no-one really cares</br>  <br>Gohan and Krillin are better fathers.

Nothing really stands out. DM has better characters, GX has better duels and 5D's has better story.</br>  <br> literally picks the only scene in the entire anime of yusei fighting without cards <br>You could argue he fought Jack by slamming his face into his fist<br><br><br>I dont think it went to shit for DS, it had plenty highs, but it wasnt nearly as tight as Fortune Cup. The cracks were starting to show</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not going to pretend Arc-V is perfect or anything. But just in terms of overall enjoyment, I think I've been having the most fun watching it and it's characters compared to the other series, and I have a lot of love for the other series too.</br>  <br>No. Arc-V has the better duels. GX has nothing.</br>  <br>Only Shun vs Sora was top tier.</br>  <br>Best duels from each series<br> DM <br>Joey vs Marik<br> GX <br>SUNDA vs Edo<br> 5ds <br>Yusei vs Kiryu 1<br> Zexal <br>Yuma vs Nasch<br> Arc-V  <br>Sora vs Shun</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Have you actually been watching Arc-V at all?</br>   Properly synced S0 is nowhere on the fucking internet <br>Should I just move on to Duel Monsters?</br>  <br>What GX duels were top tier?</br>  <br> le nostalgiafag epic maymay XD <br>Is this how you call to anyone who doesn't agree with you?</br></br>  <br>The Toei series is a waste of time anyway. Its a very mediocre adaptation. If you want the events it covers, read the manga for those parts.</br>  <br> Yuto vs Sawatari <br> Gon vs Yuya <br> Gon vs Ankokuji <br> Gon vs Yaiba <br> Yuzu vs Masumi 2 <br> Yuya vs Isao <br> Shun vs LDS Trio <br> Sora vs Yuya 2 <br> Dennis vs Gon <br> Yugo vs 227 <br><br>Yeah, sure, nothing top tier besides that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it didn't In the end.</br>  <br><br>On the top of my head.<br>Judai vs Yubel<br>Edo vs Manjoume<br>Judai vs that exodia fag. <br>Scabscarknight duel was pretty cool as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll agree GX did a good job with Judai's character in s3 with all the supreme king/yubel stuff, but it just can't beat all the strides Yugi made on his own in Millennium World. That whole arc was just fucking amazing. It's like I wasn't even watching Yu-Gi-Oh anymore.</br>  <br>Off the top of my head anything with Sho. I'm not counting the yugi duel since that is end duel. The one vs yugi copy cat was entertaining.<br><br><br>None of those are top tier.</br></br></br></br>  <br>With how things are developing Arc-V is gonna take the 3 stuff you mentioned.<br><br><br>GX had the plot made on drugs.<br><br><br> Sho <br>He was shit and so his duels, Kaiser's duels were better, specially his last duel against Johan Yubel.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> GX fag <br> anything with Sho <br>Well there's your problem, you have awful taste.</br></br></br>  <br>ARC-V is only fun because of the /a/ threads.</br>  <br>I did but quit after the burger chapter because my friend decided to join me and surpassed the point where I was reading. I got pissed off and just started the anime and it's fucking dysynced after episode 6.</br>  <br>Not really, sure, the speculation helps a lot but the fact that's pretty fun and it takes a bunch of good stuff from the other seasons.</br>  <br>ARC-V is fun because it references all other YGO series, has amazing duels, showcases every summoning method, has great character interaction, has great characters in general, has a great artstyle, has a great plot, has great Duel Disk designs, and has great anime archetypes.<br>I know liking the popular thing is edgy and cool but cmon anon</br></br>  <br>The /a/ threads only exist because people enjoy it enough to keep them going</br>  <br>I'm not a GXfag.</br>  <br> *I know hating the popular thing is edgy and cool <br>I'm too high to be arguing with weeaboos.</br></br>  <br>GX had the best comeback. It wasn't that great the first two seasons but the strong character-driven third season really brought the quality back up. Then s4 happened and it went down again until the very end graduation duel with Yugi which was hype.</br>  <br> all these listed and no Reiji vs Yuya II <br>I honestly liked that duel just a hair more than Sora vs Shun because of how Reiji really outplayed his rival rather than someone forgetting a crucial boss monster effect.</br></br>  <br>You can blame KEN for that since he was fed up of Judai or something like that.</br>    <br> has great character interaction, has great characters in general, has a great artstyle, has a great plot, has great Duel Disk designs, and has great anime archetypes <br>I'm not taking your bait.</br></br>  <br>I knew I forgot something.<br>That duel was pretty based.</br></br>  <br><br><br>I liked all the seasons, Light of destruction arc was tight as fug.</br></br></br>  <br>It's just because ARC-V threads are one giant circlejerk. Don't try to argue with them.</br>  <br><br> thinking it's bait <br><br>eat shit, GXfag</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not that anon, but if there's at least one thing Arc-V can manage, it's how the characters interact and contrast with each other.</br>  <br>500 posts from 100 different posters isn't circlejerk.</br>  <br>Eh, the problem with GX though is that a good portion of the series was them making it up as they go. It also treated it main cast the absolute worst of any series.<br>Not only is GX the series with the most protagonist is the only one to duel things, but the third season, for all it does right, also does just as much wrong such as replacing its primary cast with brand new people and even killing off most of them for the arc.</br></br>  <br> Don't try to argue with them <br>Show me where they touched your butt bitchboy?</br></br>  <br> It's like I wasn't even watching Yu-Gi-Oh anymore. <br><br>I remember originally watching that and wondering. When the fuck are they going to actually duel. As the story progressed and we learned more about Atem's past I stopped caring entirely. Would we ever see anything like that again? Less focus on the duels and more of just telling a story and character development?</br></br></br>  <br> calling truth bait <br>Anything else we need to see here?</br></br>  <br>It's a giant hugbox where if you voice any criticism about any aspect of the series, or even say that ARC-V isn't the best YGO, you will get piled on.</br>  <br> Great character interaction <br>Yuya and Yuzu have great chemistry and Gon is a MANLY best friend. Shun and Yuto are obviously friends that have been hardened by the brutality of war and as a result become hostile towards each other. As for other interactions, Dennis and Shun go great together and so do Serena and Sawatari.<br><br> Great characters in general <br>I shouldn't have to explain this one. You have shit taste.<br><br> Great artstyle <br>Bright and colorful mixed with dark and gloomy into one big mixing pot of emotions? Sounds good to me.<br><br> Great plot <br>All of the other series in an interdimensional war with each other, each with their different goals, what's not to fucking like?<br><br> Great duel disk designs <br>Not clunky and over the top like the other ones, just a tablet computer with a duel pad. Compact, portable, and customizable.<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127943598#p127950202">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't wait until the series after Arc-V airs and people get picky about it getting praised over their favorite Yugioh</br>   Kaiba as the MC <br>Fuck yeah.<br><br>Wonder if this will tie into Arc-V</br></br></br>  So I just finished HF and I still can't for the life of me figure out why exactly Kirei hates Zouken. He seems to be the only person that Kirei goes out of his way to insult.  <br>It is basically a turf war and Kotomine hates that Zouken reminds him what he is.</br>  <br>It's not a turf war. At least, Zouken doesn't think of it like that. If he wanted Kirei dead or just out of the way, the mullet priest would most certainly not have lived through the decade between the fourth and fifth wars.</br>  <br>Gilgamesh would have to kill Sakura to kill Zouken, and it didn't work out so well when he tried.</br>  <br>He's salty that Zouken enjoys suffering a hell of a lot more than he does. That's his big thing, and Zouken is better than him at it.</br>  How did Zouken, Kirei, Kerry, and Gil all manage to live in the same town for more than ten years without any of them getting shanked by the others?  <br>Luffy easily defeated Doflamingo relative his other hard fights.<br><br>Doflamingo was the easiest "hard fight" in the story, 90% of damage to Luffy was self inflicted and unlike Lucci, Doflamingo was not able to find and attack Luffy while weakened from his gear use.<br><br>There are no remaining characters in the one piece world with a strength gap greater than what Luffy faced vs Crocodile at Alabasta.<br><br>As such, Luffy could defeat ANY OPPONENT with less effort and hopelessness than when he defeated Crocodile.<br><br>Luffy was not "shichibukai tier" when he faced Croc but he will be yonko tier when he faces Kaido.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Episode 701 live stream:<br><br>http://www.ustream.tv/channel/galax<wbr>y9000</wbr></br></br>  What will we see on X Drake's flashback? (Of course there will be one)  Luffy had a lot of help. And I mean a lot of help. Without Law and a lot of civilians, it would have been a relatively easy win for Doffy.  Dumping Enel's underrated cover story.  What happened to supercolapowered live?  <br>Doflamingo's attacks were ineffective against Luffy.<br>Luffy had extensive help vs Crocodile, with Robin pulling him out of quicksand after Croc stabbed him through the chest.<br>Luffy would have died IMMEDIATELY vs Croc if Robin didn't save him.<br><br>Vs Doffy, Luffy was almost completely immune to his attacks, only forced to waste his haki because of a time limit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>reading</br>       He actually did it, that Fujitora <br><br>The absolute madman</br></br>  <br> old man dies but his sentient robots fulfill his dream </br>  Never underestimate willpower, etc.    Who is "that person"?<br>Is it Jack?</br>  <br> post timer making me rage </br>  <br>It's  captain buggy  ofc</br>  <br>Blackbeard.</br>  Rank the Straw Hats:<br><br>Robin &gt; Luffy &gt; Usopp &gt; Zoro &gt; Franky &gt; Nami &gt; Chopper &gt; Brook &gt; Sanji</br></br>  <br>Not really. To all of that.</br>  <br>Dressrosa Arc was shit, yeah. The only good thing we got from it was finally seeing dwarves, the most recent chapter and Barty being fanboi.</br>  Think these old farts can fight?  <br> enter slim shady </br>  Zoro and Sanji are destined to be together.  <br><br>Who knows. When Barto appeared and wanted to win the Mera Mera for "that person", I expected him to be a Yonko underling but look how that went.</br></br>  <br><br>Judging by the scars and weapons, I would assume they have a decent amount of experience. I would probably bet that they're all vice admiral tier at least, but I doubt they would pose any real threat to the Strawhats at this point.</br></br>  <br>Luffy &gt; Franky &gt; Usopp &gt; Chopper &gt; Robin &gt; Zoro &gt; Nami &gt; Sanji &gt; Brook<br><br>Sanji has fallen so far in my rankings since before the timeskip. I hope the upcoming events will bring him back up a bit.</br></br></br>    <br> Doflamingo was the easiest "hard fight" in the story  <br>Hardly. Without Law, without hundreds of gladiators, Doflamingo would have ended him.<br><br> 90% of damage to Luffy was self inflicted and unlike Lucci.  <br>And where is this made up percentage from? Luffy received plenty of damage outside of G4. Don't forget Law was part of the fight, Oda had Law take Jigsaw and lose an arm.<br><br>Lucci couldn't move and almost fell into the ocean from a single G3 attack. After that he had to dodge everything. Because G4 involved speed, Doflamingo had to tank everything.<br><br> Doflamingo was not able to find and attack Luffy while weakened from his gear use. <br><br>Because his exhausted corpse was dragged around by others. Don't pretend Luffy fought solo, nobody intervened in the middle of Crocodile's fight on behalf of Luffy.<br><br> Luffy was not "shichibukai tier" when he faced Croc but he will be yonko tier when he faces Kaido. <br>He'll probably job hard once or twice before he can overcome a Yonko. Even then the fight may involve the help of Law and Drake.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So there's something I don't get from the last chapter<br><br>Are the Gorosei nobles, or just dudes with power that were put there to manage the government<br><br>If so, is there someone more powerful than them or are they the absolute top of the pyramid?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy defeated Doflamingo with the same attack he defeated an animal on the calm belt.<br>There is no known transcendent advantage vs Luffy anymore. He couldn't hit croc, he had to invent a way to hit and hurt Lucci.<br>Vs Doffy he used an already made attack meant for a gorilla on an island.<br>There was "awakened DF" as a new obstacle, but he shattered it almost instantly.<br>There is no comparison.<br>Doffy hurt Law badly, but not Luffy, and it has been made clear with gear 4 that Law is no match for Luffy.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Celestial dragons are above them.</br>  <br>None of Doffy's moves were even denting Luffy in G4 for all practical purposes. If it hadn't been such a shitty "let's unnecessarily draw the fight out despite everything going to shit around us" thing Luffy could have busted Doffy pretty easily I think.</br>      <br>We don't actually know. Akainu implied they were the Celestial Dragon's 'dogs' but Akainu is on a need-to-know basis.</br>  <br>Also now that pretty much none of Luffy's close friends and allies can die all the tension has been drained away.</br>  <br><br> Are the Gorosei nobles <br><br>We don't know. The Gorosei are based in Mariejois but they don't look like any World Noble we've seen so far. It's stated that they effectively rule the world, it's just unclear if this extends to the nobles as well.</br></br></br></br>    <br>World Government still bows to the 18 Noble Families. Gorosei still CD bitches.</br>    <br><br><br>You are wrong. Without all those hostages Luffy would not have had to try and win as quickly as possible. He was immune to most of Doflamingos attacks now that he retains rubber vs haki.<br><br>Luffy DID lose to croc and would have died if not rescued by Robin after the fact.<br>Doffy made Luffy fight within a time limit, but if it was a deserted island Luffy would rape Doffy. Hostages helped Doffy, not just Luffy.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Usopp&gt;Luffy&gt;Zoro&gt;Robin&gt;Chopper&gt;Fran<wbr>ky&gt;Nami&gt;Brook&gt;&gt;Sanji</wbr></br>  <br>he even lost to crocodile twice</br>    <br> le hack <br>BravOda</br></br>    <br>Crocodile confirmed best Shichibukai<br><br>He really suffered from Oda's poor foresight on how long things were going to run with this series.<br> no Haki <br> 80,000,000 bounty <br> being hit while in Logia form because lelelemental weakness </br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> World Government still bows to the 18 Noble Families. <br><br>That's actually unconfirmed at this point in time. Certainly they have great influence over anyone underneath the Gorosei, but it's not clear if that includes the Gorosei as well.</br></br></br>  <br>Continuing what I have of cover story (I'm missing lots of pages of it)</br>  They would make a great family together.  <br>I thought the last chapter implies that they do bow to the CD? May not be outright stated, but I understood it as pretty heavily implied.</br>    Is nyaa still down for anyone else?  <br>yup, cant go on it since yesterday</br>  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87  <br>what the fuck is going on here</br>   just found out a facebook page I've had liked for about a year is owned by Doc <br>epic, simply epic</br>  <br>I dunno but I think the same artist drew this.</br>  <br>Shittiest page name tho, I'm pretty sure he said he's waiting on it to be changed.</br>  HOTPANTS<br>O<br>T<br>P<br>A<br>N<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jotaro's clothes just get gaudier and gaudier as time goes on. and that is some serious black magic to bake a star-shaped cake</br>  <br>what's the name?</br>  <br>They're worshiping a magical starfish.</br>  <br> Awesome, another fucking pointless meme page. </br>  <br><br>I see it as paying respect for a dead starfish being cremated</br></br>  <br><br> facebook dot com slash AAFPMP </br></br>  DIAMOND IS UNBREAKABLE ANIME RELEASE WHEN!?!

In part 4, he could have easily found Kira with a photograph, but since he was possessed by DIO, he couldn't use it.</br></br>  <br>This is just BAITSA DASUTO with a longer loop, isn't it?</br>  <br>but the reason the brought him to morioh was so they could use his Spirit Photography to find Sadao, or whatever his name was, this is literally one of those times where you can just say Araki forgot, since they never us it to find Kira</br>  <br>No?

Nostalgia is a hell of a drug.<br><br>I personally don't think it's as bad as everyone here is bitching about it, but then again I've been used to English dubs of anime for forever. The only things I really don't like are JYB as Jonathan (his presence was inevitable really but I did NOT expect them to cast him as any Jojo, much less the very first one, and his performance doesn't seem that great to make up for it either) and Papenbrook as Caesar (admittedly because his roles are all from shows/characters I really don't like, and we haven't even heard anything from him yet so he could prove me wrong, but I doubt it).</br></br></br>  Plot armor aside, how the FUCK did Jotaro survive any of DIO's attacks? Specifically, the scene right after "I feel like singing!" when DIO punches Jotaro into the ground. The World and Star Platinum are essentially the same stand, in strength and abilities, and when Jotaro Oraora'd DIO directly, it left him with holes in his body. And DIO could punch a whole directly through Kakyoin, penetrating the human body.<br><br>So when The World repeatedly punched Jotaro, how did he only get broken bones, which still wouldn't have been easy to shake off?

Wasn't Build Me Up Buttercup on his list?</br>  I just finished Part 4 and want to move on to Part 5, but apparently the re scanlation stopped because of Viz acquiring something or whatever. So, is Part 5's bad translation worth my time? If it isn't can I skip it and just wait for colored JoJo or something?  <br>We don't know about Walk Like An Egyptian, but both Roundabout and Last Train Home were his suggestions. <br><br>That thing about Build Me Up Buttercup is something someone here made up and parroted long enough that some others started believing it despite there being no source.</br></br></br>  <br>oh man this would be great for the ED, it even sounds vaguely Bowieish</br>  <br>There are some cool fights that shine through the bad translation, and Part 5 isn't THAT long. It's at the edge of skippable, but don't skip it.<br><br>Just be ready to reread it when they finish the new scanlation in 2020</br></br></br>  <br>Alright, I'll read it.

I don't thin there's much to "understand." I personally don't get why Josuke is so disproportionately popular  but then again I didn't think Part 4 was all it was cracked up to be either.  Which is not to say I dislike him or anything.</br></br></br></br>  <br>but jospeh hid a tommy gun in his jacket</br>  So I just got to the Wekapipo and magenta Magenta fight and I have a couple observations: <br> If Gyro's so practiced at Spin and has been doing the Golden Rotation for at least a while, why does he still need a reference to do it? Is practicing not enough to memorize it? <br> The fact that there's no Golden Ratio in their hands or faces or anything would suggest that their proportions aren't "beautiful" which amuses me a lot for some reason </br></br>  drama time<br>sort jojos from best to worse<br><br>johnny&gt;(young)joseph&gt;jo2uke&gt;josuke&gt;<wbr>jolyne&gt;jotaro&gt;joseph&gt;jonathan&gt;giorn<wbr>o</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>   reading crossover madoka/jojo fanfiction <br><br>god damn it why is there literally no good jojo-related literature besides purple haze which was too damn short and had a shitty translation<br><br>it's all DIO slash, why</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Was an animeonly for a while <br> Loved Joseph to death <br> Read the manga <br> tfw Johnyfag now </br></br></br></br></br>  Is Josuke an incel?  <br>Are you me in the ireneverse?</br>  <br>I feel you.

It seemed fine to me.</br>  <br>Nah, Harry Potter has plenty of well written fanfiction. It's less than 0.01%, but it exists. Naruto has one or two decent fics that try to fix the shit that's the source material, but everything else has only shitty fanfiction.<br><br>I expected jojo to have more fans because the manga is creative as shit and I hoped some of that creativity went into good writers. But nope.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not wrong or anything, but the author didn't take the liberties a translator needs to take in order to translate a japanese light novel. It's dry as fuck, and has a ton of narration cliches.<br><br>The story itself was pretty good, though. I liked the stands.</br></br></br>  <br> Nah, Harry Potter <br>Stopped reading there.</br></br>  <br>I'm not saying HP is good by itself, I'm just saying that good fanfiction of it does exist. I'd rather we not talk about it and make this jojo thread even more off-topic, though, so let's agree to disagree.</br>  <br>I mean, take Jotaros Ravioli:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=aD-<wbr>ZWzssjBQ</wbr>  [ ]<br>Your next post will be "Why was this written, it's really, really weird."</br></br></br>  <br>What? But the only things they have in common are being sluts and having deeply homoerotic rivalry-friendships with Zeppelis. Other than that they're pretty fucking different. Unless I'm missing something.</br>  <br><br>He's one of the most well written Jojos, probably because their was only one other person traveling with him in the longest part, giving Araki room to write him well.</br></br>  <br>Imagine a decent writer looked at Joseph and designed to adapt him to a realistic western world with a new backstory.</br>  <br> THIS ENTIRE POST <br>Holy fuck anon go to /b/ for a couple years and aquamate before you start posting on 4chan.</br></br>  <br>Is "realistic" just a new buzzword that means "things I like"?<br><br>How the fuck can you look at anything of SBR and think it's "realistic" in any way?</br></br></br>  <br>The characters are pretty realistic, the setting is obviously fantasy.</br>  <br>Oh shit, I just realized I wrote "realistic western world", my bad.

The world of Jojo is crazy, it's not a crime or bad for the characters to be crazy and "unrealistic." It's like people don't like being reminded they're reading or watching a series about magically powered people having fights and out-bullshit-ing each other. <br><br> Basically my opinion &gt; yours, neener neener </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone already did</br>  <br>I obviously don't mean character design holy shit, just their personality, circumstances, backstories.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127931771   GOT IT GOT IT YES I GOT IT  <br>Methods of Rationality is trash, just sayin'.</br>  <br> Jotero <br> Kyokin </br></br>  <br>Fantastic <br>SlavBallRun <br><br> you must perfect the squat johnny! <br> My heart and actions are utterly clouded, they are all those of vodka! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here's a taste of tha remedy (Yeah!)</br>      <br><br>in retrospect that was a pretty autistic post</br></br>  <br> in retrospect </br>  <br>pls no bully</br>  <br>Reminds me of that scene in Men In Black III where Will Smith dodges all those nails effortlessly after a brief travel back in time.</br>  <br>I think all those versions of him from the clip are versions of him that died, and he's using them as a guide for where to dodge, so it's nothing like D4C at all. if anything it's more like an unholy lovechild of KC and Horus.</br>  <br>The new scans are coming out a good pace.</br>  <br>I know, but you know I'm right</br>  <br>Narancia's face pisses me off</br>  <br>stands have nothing to do with ripple powers, the so called connection was mentioned once when stands were first introduced.

Does anyone have that trick or treat comic with Bites the Dust? I want to show it to my friend but I didn't save it.<br><br><br>No.</br></br></br>  <br>I would know if I wasn't the one helping out with the scans.</br>  <br>Then maybe realize for other scanlation teams it was their life, not just a hobby. You're still slow.</br>  <br> Implying <br>6, 7, and 8 have not reached 5 levels of gay</br></br>  <br>As if they haven't looked gay from the beginning. They were just twinks instead of the muscly type later on.<br><br>Also, no.</br></br></br>  <br>Musclemen are gay as fuck, too.<br>It was gay from the very start.</br></br>  <br>Then be patient and be thankful that a chapter isn't coming out every two weeks now.</br>  When can we expect uncensored Stardust Crusaders?  <br>Never.</br>  <br>Why aren't you scanlating the color ones anyway?</br>  <br>Although strength doesn't necessarily translate to fighting skill, Jonathan used rage strength to tear lengthwise steel bars. He's also one of only 2 Jojos to actually Oraoraora (when he attacked Bruford), the other being Jotaro when he was a kid, but Jotaro's oras were slower. I'm sure every Jojo would put up a fight, but I gotta say that Jonathan would probably come in first, while Giorno would come in last.</br>  gay priest is finally here  JoJo fashion and hair became massively gay after arc 2.  <br> Musclemen are gay as fuck, too. <br><br>It wasn't gay back then.</br></br></br>  <br>Stop it with your gay discrimination, homo.</br>  <br>Jonathan broke steel with his bare hands, even Tarkus with his zombie strength on top of already being huge wasn't that strong.</br>  <br>The Japanese stereotype for campy gayness has included huge muscles for a long time.</br>  <br> Implying Dio didn't want to lick Jonathan's abs <br><br>Nah it was just as gay back then.</br></br></br>  <br>A guy who works with me on the black and white scans is doing the colored scans himself. The black and white scans have higher priority.</br>  <br>why exactly? the anime is going to finish faster than you anyway</br>  <br>Haha, I don't think Giorno would lose to a literal cripple in a street fight.<br><br>Jojo OFFICIAL power level rankings<br><br>Jonathan&gt;Jotaro&gt;Josuke&gt;Jolyne&gt;Josep<wbr>h&gt;Giorno&gt;Gappy&gt;Johnny</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You pulled this list out of your ass. Some of it makes no sense at all.</br>  <br> Joseph lower than Jolyne  <br> Josuke above Joseph  <br><br>C'mon dude in a normal fistfight Joseph would fuck them up</br></br></br></br>  <br>Let me fix that for you<br><br>Giorno &gt; Johnny &gt; Jotaro = Gappy &gt; Jolyne &gt; Josuke &gt; Joseph &gt; Johnathan</br></br></br>  <br>If we're going without Stands, spin, or hamon, I'd say this.<br><br>Jonathan &gt; Joseph &gt; Jotaro &gt; Josuke &gt; Jolyne &gt; Gappy &gt; Giorno &gt; Johnny</br></br></br>  <br>We're talking about streetfights, that would be almost perfect for stands/hamon.</br>  <br> A 15 year old is stronger than a fucking adult <br> A girl is stronger than a guy who actually fucking lifts <br>Thise really good bait, honestly</br></br></br>  <br>The post says <br> no powers fight  <br><br>We're talking fistfights here</br></br></br></br>  <br>She went to prison and wasn't anyone's bitch, you don't get like that without knowing how to fight. Joseph lifting is all show for his homosex friends. He consistently won fights only with trickery, and every Jojo except jonathan are shown to be exceptional at that. Tricks ain't gonna fly against another jojo. He can probably still throw a good punch with his gorilla arms so that's why I placed him there.</br>  <br>Almost, but I'd raise Part 8 Josuke up to about equal with Jolyne and both of them slightly above Part 4 Josuke. They're both very physical for punchghost users, especially Jolyne who's even drawn in actual martial arts stances at times.</br>  <br>Holy shit no dude Joseph would fucking drop Jolyne man</br>  <br> Joseph lifting is all show for his homosex friends <br>You don't know how lifting works, do you? Also Jolyne was in a GIRLS prison and we never saw her fight without Stone Free you dumbass.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Does Josuke w/ Hair Insulted count as a power?</br></br></br>  <br>That's just uncontrollable rage.</br>  <br> Strongest punch ghost doesn't belong to the strongest user <br>Jonathan&gt;Josuke&gt;Jotaro&gt;Jolyne=Josef<wbr>=Jo2suke=Giorno&gt;Johnny<br><br>We all know Jonathan was the strongest but by muscle, feat and punch ghost the rest fall into place.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Oh I forgot about Johnny, yeah he'd be very low I'd say near Gappy and Giorno.<br><br>Saying Joseph is below Josuke and Jolyne is fucking dumb though, he still is a fighter, or at least very strong (climbing the erotic tower of oil). I know strength doesn't always equal fighting ability, but it does count somewhat.</br></br></br>  I just realized, Jotaro should have been CRUSHED TO DEATH regardless of whether he could stop time or not, since even when he stops time DIO is still able to move and he's still punching the Roadroller into Jotaro while he's pinned under it so it's pretty much still the same situation.  <br><br>I think Josuke would win if nothing pissed the other Joestars off enough like Defending Erina's Honor Jonathon or Nobody Could See That and Stay Calm Jotaro.</br></br>  How old is Gappy?  <br> thinking Josuke is a better fighter than Joseph <br> even thinking Jolyne is a better fighter than Joseph </br></br>  <br>Gappy a Giorno are weak but they have the hard cunt bonus. You just know they'd manipulate the fight to get the upper hand and see solutions others mightn't consider.</br>  <br>probs like 20 or 18<br><br>i remember someone saying their of legal age so 18 is more likely since Gappy was gona go to highschool at some point</br></br></br>  <br>A couple of months at most, but JoJolion might have only been a single month so far. <br><br>He's a brand new being, neither Kira or Kujo.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, with that musculature and how he manhandled Ojirou, I'd put him above Giorno. Plus, Giorno never really attacked anyone with his own fists.</br>  <br>He climbed the oil with hamon though, which doesn't really showcase physical abilities. On second though, his ripple training like controlled breathing might come in useful in a fist fight</br>  <br>Ok if we're going by ruses you must consider Joseph, come on. Gappy is super lanky, but maybe that's just because of the loose clothes. Giorno was only creative with his OP stand, but I'll give you the possibility of him being creative in a fight. But not as creative as Joseph.</br>  <br> Implying Josuke isn't brutal when he needs to be and has the muscle and determination to back it up as well as tatical smarts in the heat of the moment.  <br>He is the most balanced Jojo only out done by raw Jonathan strength m8. <br> Doesn't know what = means <br>In retrospect Jolyne should probably move down a slot due to lack of muscle bit Gappy and Giorno would stand a solid chance based on their approach alone. Gappy in particular has been shown as hyper competent physically with good thinking under pressure and pain thresholds.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't matter if it's with hamon, climbing the tower took a toll on his body and MUSCLES while keeping proper breathing to maintain the ripple. Hamon users are trained to have controlled breathing, so that means they have a lot of endurance even if they don't use Hamon.</br>  <br>Giorno sure, but Sailor Josuke uses his own body a lot and runs around dropkicking motorcycles. He'd beat the shit out of Giorno when it comes to standless fights and I'd also put him above the first Josuke who we really saw fighting physically.</br>  <br> a couple of months at most <br><br>C'mon dude you know what I mean</br></br></br>  <br> who we really saw fighting physically. <br>Never really saw, I mean</br></br>  Imagine either Jotaro or Polnareff die in the final battle and that another crusader replaces them in part 4 or 5.<br><br>How would it be?</br></br>  <br>Well see that's just it. They might have rused but Josef is all ruse. Gio and Jo2uke have both outmanoeuvred people tricks aside. Both have functioned well while putting themselves in harms way. Josef would need to have a ruse ready as shit went down that was good enough because without hamon there won't be much of a chance to ruse mid fight in a way that would fool any one other than Johnny and Jonathan.</br>  <br>The cast page at the beginning of every volume says he appears to be about 19.</br>  <br>All the pre-part 5 Jojos are built like 7 foot tanks.</br>  Ok here is a realistic rating of physically strongest JoJos<br><br>Johnathan&gt;Joseph&gt;Jotaro&gt;Josuke=Gapp<wbr>y&gt;Giorno&gt;Jolyne&gt;Johnny<br><br> inb4 Gappy is a twink <br>look at  Gappy has some gaisn. Anyone got the full scan of that though? I never saved it but I know it's out there</br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Kakyoin meets more milfs.<br>Iggy is now a turtle-dog.</br></br>  <br>Josuke wasn't for long.</br>  <br>You know that lifting doesn't make you a good fighter right? Granted hamon training is essentially martial arts but you seriously realise that muscles aren't everything, especially not the muscle beast kind.<br>Lithe, agile, powerful. Lifts good just lifts good.</br></br>  What if part 8 ends up being as big as part 3 or 5 (5 is big in Japan they love it there)<br><br>I mean JoJo is getting pretty popular now and I've seen a few pics of advertisements in Japan with Gappy and stuff. <br><br>I take it nipps are loving part 8 so far? That's pretty cool man,  OVA in 2030 when part 8 finishes? </br></br></br></br>  <br>If it's pure physical strength alone then I more or less agree just make Jolyne and Gio equal and we can call it a day. <br>If it's non-powered fighting capability then you're off.</br></br>  <br>Swap Giorno for Jolyne and that list is spot on, remember Giorno is only 15</br>  <br><br>Does anyone remember Giorno actually punching or kicking anybody without his Stand?</br></br>  post awesome music<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qKP<wbr>vCmAc8bQ</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>it's getting popular in the US thanks to the anime, in Japan it's not more popular than it's always been<br><br>japs probably hate part 6 and 7 because america</br></br></br>  can someone post the new fucked up kars art i can't find it because i'm retarded  <br> Polnareff dies against Vanilla ice sending Iggy ahead <br> As DIO is about to decapitate Jotaro with a stop sign iggy flies down and farts to distract him <br> Gets kicked the shit out of and appears in Part 5 in one of those dog wheel chairs <br> The Fool Reqiuem <br> It gains the ability to manipulate sub atomic particles like it could with sand, allowing it to deconstruct anything on a subatomic level <br><br>Sounds good</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Part 6 wasn't as popular due to the complicated Heaven plot and bizarreness getting too much I guess and Part 7 didn't get as much recognition since it moved to Ultra Jump without much advertising for it.</br>  <br>No but neither did Josuke or, when you think about it, jolyne and Johnny.<br>Essentially you just need to take, how they fight, their pain thresholds, physical strength and physical competence into account. <br>Either way Jonathan comes out on top in every list. So at least we have one thing everyone can agree on.</br></br></br>  <br>It's selling well but it never had a chance of being as big as the major parts in either popularity or awareness. It was the subject of that huge ad because it it was for Ultra Jump's anniversary and Jojo is by far the biggest draw that magazine has at the moment</br>  <br>Six and Seven are great parts. Six gets over looked far too often. Sure people get really salty that it essentially ended the main continuity but if you reread the series it really does stand up as an amazing part. I found part 5 to be much better in retrospect as well. Still the worst part  along with 1 and 3  but MUCH more enjoyable than the first run through.</br>  <br>Yeah but he still seems to have more gains than a 19 year old girl. Realistically I could see Giorno being stronger than her physically</br>  <br>I love 6 but it sure is one hell of a mixed bag. <br><br>I suspect some of the hate comes from people who binge read the series and get burnt out when they finish a part all about crazy fights, then meet a new cast and immediately go back to more crazy fights. It might be a good idea to take a little break between reading 5 and 6.</br></br></br>  <br> Polnareff get Fisted instead of Kakyoin <br> Jotaro retires thanks to Dio's RoadRoller <br> Kakyoin Surprises Dio with Emerald Splash <br> ??? <br> He wins <br><br>Part 4<br><br>Jotaro is fucked up thanks to a Roadroller fuckin exploding on him<br><br>He sends Kakyoin to go out searching for Josuke<br><br>Angelo fight goes as normal<br><br>RHCP still goes as normal beaten by josuke (and later okuyasu)<br><br>Josuke and Kakyoin go hunting , kakyoin emerald splush the rats meanwhile Josuke heals Kakyoin<br><br>The Mysterious Yoshikage Kira , Kak get's fucked up by sheer heart attack and Koichi gets act 3, later Kira comes by and Kakyoin regain consciousness and punch him like he did with Tower of Gray and Kira change his face<br><br>Kira's Final Stand, just when Kira is going to activate Bite the Dust again, Koichi uses act 3 in him to give Kakyoin time to use smerald splash and Kira Rip</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What gains? If you're talking about that volume cover, that doesn't count and Gappy was clearly shown to have muscles in the first chapter.</br>  Isn't Jolyne supposed to be very very intelligent? <br> Different levels of intelligence u fag lol <br>You know what I mean, I guess.

A lot of Jolyne's fights have her using her fists.</br>  <br>Actual fighting skills.</br>  <br>Couple things you got wrong. <br> brojo <br>That is forever Gyro's spot. <br> supporting <br>Speedwagon<br> crew <br>part 4 dancing torture</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What do you guys think of the dub? I think it's okay but I think Joseph sounds too refined  <br>I don't recall Jolyne ever fighting anything without Stone Free, though</br>  <br>And how does that prove anything with strength?</br>  <br>By rows, where 0 is a shit pick, 1 is acceptable and 2 is great<br>8/12 <br>7/10<br>2/12<br>3/10<br>4/8<br>46% anon, that is a failing grade. The potential is there though, when you're right you're very right.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Gio is like an autistic pain glutton. I can't see him losing but thinking about it Jolyne is pretty good at rolling with punches as well.

Like that Joseph's father George Joestar II is not this so called Jewish screenwriter that Lisa Lisa married much later?<br><br>If so, please go away.</br></br></br>    <br> Needing a requiem to be viable <br> Suggesting requiem when the smartest thing is just to level up your stand like Kira instead of super charging it temporarily like Giorno. </br></br>  <br> instead of super charging it temporarily like Giorno. <br>GER was permanent, wasn't it?</br></br>  <br>Oh, I am not ignoring that I'm just saying that Lisa Lisa is jewish</br>  <br>Yeah I know that, I specified that in 3 other of my posts and got sick of clarifying</br>  <br> Jotaro becomes a family man <br> Jolyne grows up to love her daddy <br> Gay priest attacks Jotaro's house to get his memory <br> Kakyoin protects his JoJo and kills Pucci </br></br></br></br>  What if Speedwagon got an Stand?

Oh Fuck! Oh Crap!" <br> And then Kakyoin kills Pucci with Emerald Splash to the back of the head. <br> Gay priest is fucking dead. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Since when is Joshuu a sidekick?</br>  <br>Is okuyasu the only surviving brojo? Is kakyion considered a brojo instead of polnareff?</br>  <br>It'd be called Bat Outta Hell</br>  <br><br>I keep forgetting that Jonathan and Jotaro are technically doctors.</br></br>  <br>Since he's the one that hangs out with gappy the most and since yasuho is the love interest</br>  <br>Why can't it be the love interest? Joshuu is not the Jojo's friend or even ever on his side. He tried to pull a fast one on him with the leaves and during the beetle fight he was rooting against him the entire time.</br>  <br>I dunno. Some believe that you can't have both a love interest and a brojo at the same time.</br>  <br>He deleted evidence of jo2uke breaking the fishtank when he found it on the camera, trying to cover for him. They're forming somewhat of a friendship</br>  <br> kills Pucci <br>Do you seriously think Kakyoin could kill the man who got his arm eaten by a baby, stabbed himself in the throat, and got impaled by spears made from his own blood and still managed to come back? Pucci's plot armor was ridiculous.</br></br>  <br>I read the red part with Araki quotes</br>  <br>Polnareff is Speedwagon (and so is Okuyasu, he's got two positions to fill)</br>  <br>Well HGR would have the ability to unravel things and add them to its mass, including fundamental concepts.</br>  <br>But then he totally wants him to get fucked in the Beetlebowl and goes off trying to find him with Jobin afterwards.</br>  <br>Wasn't he just trying to hide it from Josuke that it was because he stepped on the leaves?</br>  <br>Loved the MKW days.</br>  I understand 90% of how King Crimson works<br>While watching this video I got reminded that this happens<br>What the fuck is the deal with this<br>Did Diavolo use Epitaph on Bruno or what</br></br></br>  <br>I thought Crazy Diamond's power was to make objects like Josuke THINKS they originally were, hence his repairs getting fucked up when he gets pissed?</br>  <br>Requiem powers have very little to do with the stand's original powers. Plus, the arrow fell out of GER after it fucked up Diavolo, so Kakyoin probably wouldn't have requiem permanently.</br>  <br>So GER causes fate to become death but Divolo's stand ability makes in relive the future?</br>  <br>So does the Stand has to stay in contact with the Arrow continuously for it to have a Requiem form? pfft, you're talking about a Stand that is perfectly capable of constricting anything, that isn't gonna be a problem.</br>  <br>Can someone explain to me how it works?<br><br>As far as I know he can "vaguely(?) see the future and 'erase' time." <br><br>I don't even know what the erase time part means.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> avdol survives <br> burns gay vampires bitch ass <br>  jotaro gets crippled due to road roller <br> sends out avdol <br> burns water guy <br> burns RHCP guitar and fucks him up <br> burns rats <br> looses to SHA and and koichi gets Act 3 <br> burns kira and kira gets a face transplant <br>  burns his ass when Act 3 freezes him in final fight <br><br>I wish araki did this</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He erases time, during the erased time everyone is on autopilot, afterwards everyone feels like time skipped. During the erased time Diavolo sees everything that will happen like you would see it on an animation reel.<br>If you were to shoot a bullet at Diavolo and it would hit him during the erased time, the bullet would continue on its original path through Diavolo but would not actually hurt him because he erases effect along with time, after the erased time the bullet would be behind him.<br>I still have no idea how the "future you" thing works though</br></br></br>  <br>or kira doesnt even get BTD cause he burns up kiras dad</br>  <br>We don't actually know if you can force the arrow to stay in because we've only seen two of them for a pretty short time. Beyond all that, I vaguely remember requiem stands are separate beings that don't have users, so you'd run the risk of the stand just fucking off and not listening to you.</br>  Would you a pillarwoman?  Is Jorge Joestar canon?  <br>with all my heart</br>  <br>i hope not.</br>  <br> still being this mad gamergate won </br>  What if Johny had two sons, but one of them was raised as a daughter because of that Higishikita curse?  <br>did they?</br>  <br>No</br>  <br>Fuck off trapfag</br>  Ok Valentine's power allows him to enter different dimensions without damage. Even meeting one of his clones does nothing to him. So seeing how seeing being segmented by pouring water to send piece of him to different dimensions didn't harm him, would cream passing through him just do nothing?<br><br>Could the President jump inside creams mouth and be find inside the dark dimension like Vanilla Ice?</br></br>  <br>Pretty much yeah, his power is really broken.</br>  <br><br>You know how Diavolo "lended" Epitaph to Doppio? That's what's happening here.

How does he dodge? <br><br>I understand that he can briefly see what is going to happen next when he uses his stand's ability, but he can kinda 'teleport' like part 3 Dio, right?<br><br>(haven't read part 5 yet)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like his famous catch phrase "WRYYYYY"</br>  I want to cum inside Hot pants.  <br>He can't teleport. If he intended to walk behind you before the time deletion and you intended to spend the next few seconds twiddling your thumbs, time will skip and he will be behind you while your thumbs are twiddling.<br>This is made clear in their first encounter with King Crimson where one character asks another for a drink then time jumps and the character thanks him for the bottle before they both realise they have no recollection of the bottle being handed over.</br></br>  <br>september i think<br>not positive</br></br>  King Crimson's effect is essentially like what timestop looks like to an outsider, except everything somehow moves during timestop instead of just Dio/Jotaro and whatever they touch.  So how long will the Hardcover versions of the manga go on?<br><br>I bought Vol 1 and 2 for Phantom Blood recently, and I know Part 2 is getting the same treatment. <br><br>It'd be nice if I could buy Part 3 and onward in Hardcover.</br></br></br></br>  <br> it was an illusion. <br> Whitesnake punches kakyoin through chest. <br> Queer pope is dead. <br>  Meido in Heaven </br></br></br></br>  <br>that's my job</br>  Fact of the matter is Avdol, Kakyoin and Iggy died on a fight that had nothing to do with them for the sake of a fish fetishist, a cheating old man and a frenchie, and never got a chance to live long, happy lives.  <br>No one asked them to join.</br>  <br><br>I think Part 3 is nearly done over in Japan so it's a matter of when we would get it.</br></br>  <br>I think abdul did, but he had good reasons.</br>  <br>I wonder how many people buy these only to realise the cover art is nothing like the content inside.</br>  <br>Star Platinum looks so fucking bad in Araki's new style.<br><br>Also Magician's Red has a serious "it's a livin'" look going on.</br></br></br>  <br>I actually like old Joseph in this new artstyle</br>   new volume next week <br> new Ultra Jump with Jojo on the cover next week <br>How long does it normally take for the covers show up online?</br></br>  <br>In the USA it's once every three months.<br><br>It could go one for about 6 years.</br></br></br>  <br>He just wanted to eliminate all evil.<br>Trying to play hero while being black and not the jojo is a bad idea.</br></br>  <br><br>The more I see Araki's art progressing and applied to older designs always gets me interested. Not sure if GER would ever come out looking good.</br></br>  <br>Star Platinum is showing off its puny muscles.</br>    <br>He had to protect the KFC's in the world, for his kind. Truly a hero.</br>  I've just started reading SBR, and I'm feeling sorry for Dio during the first leg of the race, he's clearly a skilled jockey who'd be winning easily if he wasn't up against a series of utterly bullshit competitors, what's especially sad is that everytime he's about to win it's because he's using a genuinely clever technique and then he gets bullshitted back into the main pack of horses.<br><br>He's a dio so I can only imagine how terrible his personality is, but still he's basically just really unlucky at this point.</br></br>  <br> Hierophant Green and Silver Chariot look absolutely perfect <br>I always knew they were ahead of their time.</br></br>  <br>Your filename is out of order.</br>  <br>He actually doesn't turn into an asshol till later</br>  <br>Diego isn't as bad as DIO.</br>  Would you guys actually read JogJog's Bizarre adventure? I might do something.  <br>great taste, Johny truly is the best Jojo there is.</br>   tfw no Johnny x Hotpants doujinshi <br>why live?</br>  <br>Johnny&gt;Josuke&gt;Gappy&gt;Jolyne&gt;Giorno&gt;J<wbr>otaro&gt;Joseph&gt;Jonathan</wbr></br>  <br>you said Rhinoceros Beetle twice asshole</br>  <br>if you belive it Diego is actually the best written DIO<br>but thats natural since characters are really well written in SBR</br></br>  <br>Don't bully Gay priest.</br>  <br>Is there art about Gold Experience Requiem with Araki's new style?</br>  <br><br>None, only Part 5 new art is usually with the Gucci scenes with Bruno and the crew and Gio obviously. <br><br>There was newer depictions of the villains from the series from a JoJo book cover. Kira is probably the oddest.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If stands are being used, this. Although I maintain that Giorno doesn't have Gold Experience Requiem activated permanently, so I might lower him down to the same level as Gappy if that's the case.<br><br>Still, actual day to day usefulness, Josuke's is so much better than every other stand on the planet it's unreal. Not that it's perfect in a one on one stand fight, but still.<br><br>Street fight without stands  is pretty accurate, but Joseph needs to be higher than Jolyne and Gappy needs to be higher than Giorno.</br></br></br></br></br>  STRIKE THE YUKINA  <br>I want to strike Yukina's blood.</br>  From here on, this is my thread.

Look at this face, she's fucking adorable</br>    <br>I would a brown loli</br>  <br>One of the few series where the best girl won.</br>  animation quality wasn't that great but the cast of characters made up for it  <br>Fuck off bear</br>  <br>Are you saying Koaki is best girl, or are you saying both girls are best girl, and they combine to make even better best girl?</br>  <br>Plastic memories rip off.</br>  <br>I hope this is bait. No one can be this retarded</br>  You know it's true.  <br>Me too, one of my top shows even though I watched it straight after reading all 90 (at the time) chapters over the two previous nights.</br>  <br>I love Ai-ren.<br>There's so little that goes on but nearly every chapter is full of sadness. It reminds me of YKK but focusing on a very small cast.</br></br>  Is there a reason that I don't hear more about Tari Tari?<br><br>It's actually the best I've ever seen for so many reasons.</br></br>  <br>K-On with a serious note I guess, I liked it.</br>  <br>SnW doesn't really count since basically everyone on /a/ loves it. But overall, yeah, outside of /a/, no one really cares or knows about it.<br><br><br> K-On <br>You only say that because of the design, aren't you?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's pretty good, the alien episode is fucking awful though.</br></br>  <br>I actually cried when Ai died, and it showed Ikuru just fucking devoid of emotion, and emotionally dead.</br>  Emotional anime =/= good anime  <br>These are the kind of people that will call Lifetime movies top tier film</br>  <br>Yes, I mean, cute girls doing cure things I guess, but in a different setting.<br><br>I also believe Ghost Hound is underrated as hell.<br><br>I believe the animation is amazing the only problem is that a lot of people find it boring.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but hey, at least he wasn't depressed the whole time before he died.<br>He was happy and that must count for something, right? I mean, sure, he feels more like shit afterwards but at least he wasn't simply sad while waiting for death.<br><br><br>If something doesn't elicit any emotion on any level, it fails as being good at anything. Art that doesn't touch simply wastes people's time. <br><br><br>Yeah, me too. I cried pretty hard when it happened.<br>At that point, I think I was as emotionally broken as Ikuru. It was just brutal.<br>And it's weird because literally from the start, you know both are going to die, you know Ai's going to die, you know exactly how's going to play out. But it still fucking hurts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You will learn japanese.</br>  <br>Ghost Hound had good atmosphere but the story was really meh with an equally meh ending.</br>  <br>It's because that was the plan of the manga. They want you to build up a love for these two doomed lovers, and watch as they grow closer, and smile when they finally make love.<br>And feel the smile slip off your face in the next chapter, and your heart shatter when you realize why Ikuru looks so dead.<br> At least Ikuru and Ai survived in some way. I wish we could have found out what kind of person their child grew up to be. Did it grow up on stories about it's parents? </br></br></br>  <br>Maybe it was meh because it had a bit of slice of life in it?<br><br>Usually those slice of life endings are meh.<br><br>But Ghost Hound was the first anime that gave me shivers, and jumpscares.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Really love Kamichu but I have to agree with this <br>It just felt like a completely different show. Otherwise it's great.</br></br>    It's better than LWA  <br>It's good but the orginal manga are better. God-tier OST though, would listen to while reading and cooking</br>  <br> liru project never   ;_; </br>  <br>I was pondering watching this, is it worth or is it too boring for those who are not used to slice of life?</br>  SAO  <br>I know but it just hurts so badly.<br>It's like you're not suppose to feel bad because there's no point feeling sad for doomed people but it's done in such a way that just twist the blade in your back as the story progresses.<br><br>And it's not only the fact that they're doomed but that you keep being reminded that the happy times won't last forever, that death is right around the corner, that Ikuru's health is progressively going to shit, etc. Then it just unravels and you're left with pure sadness.<br><br>It's really beautiful and horrible in its execution. <br>I really love Ai-Ren, it's just a perfect bundle of tumbling down sadness. There's really something humane about Ai-Ren that I just can't put my finger on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Koaki is clearly better. Chiaki didn't even care about him until the last minute. <br><br> Also dat overly lewd kissing scene with the ex boyfriend. <br>That's when I found out that the author draws porn.</br></br></br></br>  <br>loved it, made me hungry<br> select all the food </br></br>  Around 7 hours left.  Reminder that Yuya and Yuzu exist because Kaiba wanted to put it in a dragon  <br>Yummy yummy Yuuya tummy</br>  <br>WIll they be together at the end? and more importantly<br>will they get laid? I know they want to got laid with each other. Those eye fucking were too obvious.</br></br>   In the end, Kaiba was behind it all   <br> If they want to push this Numeron Code crap <br>Who says they want to? /a/ doesnt count</br></br>  <br>Takahashi is the one who came up with concept of Signers, D-Wheels, and the Dark Signers were based off of his idea to have Riding Duel on the Nazca Lines. And thats just a couple things. You really underestimate his involvement in the series.</br>  <br><br>Are you retarded? The reason we got Riding Duels and D-Gazers is because of Kaz</br></br>  <br>huh guess I have an excuse to watch Arc-V for once. Hope Jack BTFO out Yuya.</br>  <br>Takahashi is just too fucking based</br>  Odds of Jack crashing the Wheel of Fortune during the course of Arc-V?  JONOUCHI-KUN!  <br>Did Jounouchi use Foolish Burial?</br>  LADIEEEEES AND GENTLEMENNNN<br><br>PLACE YOUR BETS FOLKS PLACE YOUR BETS<br><br>WILL IT BE THE RISING STAR OR THE KING TAKING HOME THE PRIZE?</br></br></br></br>  I just want to see Scar Red Nova in action again.  <br>I'm really hyped to see Joey's new design<br><br>His outfits were always the best because they weren't over the top, gay, leather, or overdesigned</br></br></br>  <br>Things that Kaz is involved in the story since DM<br><br>GX:<br>The school setting<br><br>5Ds:<br>-Signers<br>-The idea of dueling on motorcycles<br>-The Nazca motif, which led to Dark Signers<br><br>Zexal:<br>-The two character in one main character concept<br>-The idea of ZEXAL power<br>-Anna<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127949480#p127950122">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>me ;)</br>  <br>His outfits were just standard</br>  Am I the only one who wants to punch this thing to death?  <br>Well yeah, I don't really expect gut-busting laughter from anime but this shit didn't even get me to crack a smile</br>  Anime has never been funny, weebos.<br><br>Just like women, nips are incapable of humour.</br></br>  <br>She's a fake NEET like Anzu.</br>  <br>neo-/a/ also doesn't know what NEET means.</br>  <br>This is why you only read posts about it on /a/ beforehand.
