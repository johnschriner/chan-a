Isn't that something you're supposed to do though?</br>  <br>Yes but drawing from imagination is a lot harder if you want to make natural poses. <br>Having a refrence to go by makes it a lot easier.</br></br>  Kanase from Strike the Blood getting creampied and impregnated (with x-ray).<br>It'd be all happy and vanilla with hand-holing, teary eyes, and smiling.<br>Also requesting her dressed as an angel, how one typically looks or the MGE version.</br></br>  <br>Hey, In the last thread I was told to check in tomorrow which is today so... how's the request with Lum and that Pontiac coming along?</br>  <br>Well, "today" isn't over is it?</br>  <br>OKAY, okay, sorry if I'm being impatient.

Love that process.</br>  <br>There could be, I wouldn't care.<br><br>At first I wanted mostly to draw waifus, not because I'm bad or hung up on cute girls, but because I wanted to make waifufags happy<br><br>But so many of them are evil, antisocial, scheming cunts, I got over it<br><br>Might as well mix it all together.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I still don't know what to request for the weekend and I don't understand why I'm making this post since none of you faggots are going to give a decent suggestion.  <br>What makes waifufags and regular requesters so different in terms of personality that there is this need to separate them?</br>  <br>Very nice.

I just plan to make sure I have a request in mind by Friday.</br></br>  <br>I have all my requests lined up.</br>  <br>I usually just come up with a request when I wake up on Friday, unless it's a holiday like the 4th which I planned two weeks in advance.</br>  <br>I come up with a request to request for my waifu usually by the end of the previous waifu threads.<br><br>That or by Wednesday, mostly.<br> Then again, I'm always requesting in drawthreads, so coming up with things to request kind of just clicks. </br></br></br></br>  Requesting Ogiue from Genshiken being spanked by a floating hand. <br><br> I love her so much </br></br>  <br>I request for a couple weeks, stop requesting after a few deliveries altogether, take a few weeks at least off from requesting, just post in the thread and appreciate the art, then request again. I've been off from requesting for like 3 weeks now, but I think I'll come back this weekend maybe. I just don't want to be greedy. If I get things I feel like I shouldn't ask for too much more so others will have a better chance too. I just want us all to be a little happier. Wish I could draw or color or something.</br>  <br>I've got a big list of requests, I never run out.</br>  Requesting Nadeko dressed as Solid Snake<br>bonus points if there's also Medusa as Old Snake</br>  <br>I only feel like people who has a shitton of deliveries should be the ones to take a breather.</br>  <br>Like who?</br>  <br>Requesting Adlet doing Fremy.<br>Make it weird and/or hilarious.</br></br>  <br>It wasn't funny the first time, it's not funny now. Fuck off.</br>  <br>Well also, my waifu has TONS of fanart already in general. A lot of these anons have waifus from more obscure series that don't get to see new images of her just by checking a few pixiv artists' pages. But then, at the same time, I really like the idea of an anon drawing a picture of her specifically for me, so I still do.

Alice in Wonderland is not really a kid's book. Especially not the squeal, Through the Looking Glass. They were written by a Mathematician (as opposed to a children's author), and had some complex and philosophical ideas and concepts. Not all things 'appropriate for kids' are 'only' for kids. As I don't know kid's books, Winnie the Pooh was my best example I could think of as only being for kids, but that's not even right (which is why I specifically said "insert better example"). Maybe a better comparison is something like Looney Tunes to Caillou. Both are fine for kid's to be watching, but Caillou is specifically for children and only children, whereas Looney Tunes is just meant to be an enjoyable show. And that's what Anne seemed like while I watched it, a show specifically for children. I'm not saying it wasn't well made, but it literally provided nothing of value to me as an adult. The character is learning lessons that you should have already learned in your life, and that seemed to be the only point of the show. Which again, absolutely fine for people of that age group or younger to relate to, but seems absurd for an adult to consider it their favorite without some specific reason.</br></br></br></br>    <br>This sounds like a very hipster-ish chart</br>  So I've only recently picked up Dennou Coil because everyone keeps recommending it with Lain, and what the fuck is this shit? I'm only halfway through but it's been boring as fuck so far, definitely doesn't compare with Lain in quality.<br><br>I mean I could understand why they'd be labeled as having similar themes, but man if it wasn't a snore-fest. <br><br>Of course maybe I just have a thing for girls in bear suits.</br></br></br></br>  <br>4/6<br><br>5/6<br><br>7/10<br><br>4/5<br><br>2/5<br><br>Geass and Valvrave are on here mainly because /a/ made them both a wild ride. Good times.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>It's implying the shows are common on 3x3 threads and are overused to as "I have good tastes". It's not saying the shows are bad, just that they are unoriginal to put on a 3x3, especially when your 3x3 consists mostly of them. I'm saying this as someone with 5/9 of the shows on my 3x3 being in that chart, so take it as you will.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  <br> 2/5 <br>lol, you are not even seeing the irony in that one?<br>/a/ has really gone to shit</br></br></br></br>  <br> edgy shounen self insert type shit <br><br>You never know. Some people might actually like it.</br></br></br>  <br>Similar concepts as Lain. The mood/atmosphere of the show and characters is absolutely nothing like Lain. I certainly wouldn't say that liking one means you will like the other. <br><br><br>2/2<br><br><br>2/3 - Berserk<br><br><br>2/4 +Bebop +Mononoke - Berserk - GTO<br><br><br><br>Regardless, his rating seems fair, not sure what you are implying.<br><br><br><br>Forgot to post mine.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Both are pretentious.

Despised the female character (can't remember her name). The ending was abrupt/out of place of the rest of the series. None of the characters (from what I can remember) aside from Guts and Griffith were developed in any meaningful way. I did enjoy Griffith as a character, and some of the action scenes and politics of sorts though. It's not that I thought it was bad, I just didn't think it was anything special.<br><br><br><br>Alright.<br><br><br>Bottom right is Shinigami no Ballad. Rather light-hearted kid's show about a young girl who is a shinigami dealing with related concepts. I wouldn't highly recommend it, but I personally enjoyed it. <br><br><br>My opinion on the charts I linked to in the last thread stand. Charts in this one (almost) all seem legit. <br><br><br>My favorite anime are Lain and Boogiepop. The charts in order left to right, then top to bottom.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Every single one of these shows are great. Each one of them are some of the best works in their respective genre so it's not surprising they're popular by people with good taste.</br>  <br> My favorite anime are Lain and Boogiepop. <br>So you don't actually like anime?

You're clearly a master at explaining your thoughts.</br></br></br>  <br>What is 5 across 4 down it looks interesting. I know what the rest of that shit is.</br>  <br><br> you don't actuaally like anime? <br> So he can be the hipsterest <br>I'm absolutely lost as to what you guys are saying. What is wrong(/hipster?) with Lain and Boogiepop being my favorite two anime?</br></br></br></br>  <br>What's the bottom right corner, Is it angel's egg?<br>Other than katanagatari I agree with this chart for the most part, and I love that Kaiba is getting recognition.</br></br>  Lain fucking sucks  <br><br>SSY, Kino, and Katanagatari are trash.</br></br>  <br>Votoms</br>  <br> Katanagatari <br> trash <br>That's some shit taste</br></br></br>  <br>Anyone who likes Boogiepop is not a human being. Get off of /a/ reptilian scum.</br>  <br>I'm glad Shinsekai Yori got on that list. The only good threads it got was the finale discussion while the rest was just rampant shitposting by people who dropped it or saw the gay scenes out of context. It's the closest we'll ever get to a "The Giver" adaptation.</br>  <br>All this tells me is you don't like certain genres. Those shows are some of the best anime has to offer in their respective genre. A more appropriate statement would be that you couldn't appreciate those shows, not that they're trash. It's okay not to like things because they don't fit in with your (bad)taste, but all of those shows are good at what they do.</br>   including movies and shows in the same 3x3 <br><br>Why. Make a two separate 3x3s.</br></br>  <br><br>Remove Lain, Eva and Z Gundam, they are too popular.<br><br>Add Gundam ZZ, Uchouten Kazoku and Anne.</br></br></br></br>  <br> remove a good gundam show and replace it with another gundam show that isn't as good <br>For what purpose. Also that isn't a rec chart it's a shitposting chart. Although it is a pretty good rec chart, it's only by coincidence.</br></br>    <br/>  <br> itazura na kiss <br> Mobile suit gundam </br></br>  <br> they are too popular <br>Time for bed.</br></br>  <br><br>Kino is a terrible character and MC, she's less of a character and more of a walking plot device, also the stories are really, really predictable.<br><br>SSY has an interesting plot but the characters, direction, animation and pacing are horrible.<br><br>Katanagatari was extremely boring, Nisio is a pretentious hack who can;t write worth shit and his dialogue is excruciating to sit through.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>didn't know those or bottom right, correct them so I can fix?</br>  <br>Itazura -&gt; Penguindrum<br>Mobile suit Gundam -&gt; Zeta Gundam<br>You got Votoms right</br></br></br>  <br>Why?</br>  <br> terrible character and MC <br>What does that even mean?

A story is always predictable according to some random shitposter on the internet.<br><br> SSY has an interesting plot but the characters, direction, animation and pacing are horrible. <br>SSY strengths lie in it's world building, plot, themes, and aesthetic. It has a lot of problems but it's strengths are so well done it's definitely in a league of it's own.<br><br>The show takes great care in elaborating every detail of its world, from the current paranoid stability of District 66 to the series of grim decisions that led to this point to the culture and motivations of the subjugated queerats. It feels solid, much moreso than most fictional worlds do, and every episode reveals the great care that went in to thinking through and articulating this world.<br><br> Katanagatari was extremely boring, Nisio is a pretentious hack who can;t write worth shit and his dialogue is excruciating to sit through. <br>Not even going to bother with this shitposting tier opinion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>went with reverse image search for those 3. the rest I've seen. should be good now.</br>  <br>I have never seen such an objectively wrong post before.<br><br><br>I feel like people give Lain too much credit, especially when compared to Haibane Renmei or even Texhnolyze. <br><br>While the other HR and Tex actually attempt to reflect on and analyze their symbolism and themes, Lain just bombards you with a lot of computer generated abstract imagery and makes no attempt to explain itself. Pretentious gets thrown around a lot by people who don't actually understand what that word means, but Lain is pretentious by definition. Even ABe confirmed in his writings in various artbooks he's done.<br><br><br> Tomino directed Gundam <br> Good <br><br>Please stop this. I made the mistake of watching 0079, Zeta, and ZZ after buying into the hype. Even among the three, ZZ is the worst. Tomino is a terrible director with a few innovative ideas that made his work stand out at the time, but age absolutely terribly, especially compared to things like LoGH, Macross, or any other classics from that time. With G-Reco there is no more nostalgia googles to hide behind either. 08th MS team is the best Gundam even with it's director dying halfway through.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> nostalgia goggles <br>I watched all 3 just last year and I thought they were great.

Didn't the movie have a rocket scene with Beethoven playing or something.</br>  <br>The meaning of pretentious is in the name. Pretentious means pretending there is some deeper meaning to it where there is none. ABe has made it abundantly clear that a lot of the imagery and symbolism in Lain were thrown in there much in the same way Anno threw in Christain imagery into Eva because "It looked cool", not because there was there was anything to analyze, understand, and discuss. Lain brings nothing more to the table than the internet can be a scary place. Everything from the suicides to the warped and dark imagery was nothing more than things thrown in to look interesting.<br><br>Haibane Renmei on the other hand used copious amounts of religious imagery and themes, but baked them into the setting, story, and personal conflicts of each of the characters. They then used the personal struggles of the characters, the problems relating to the town, as well as what it takes to pass on to present the viewer with questions about the underlying themes and morality.

But it's okay because she's a cute girl.</br>  <br>Consider suicide.</br>  <br>its the background image for pixiv accounts.</br>  Ebina is the only good reason to watch this series.  <br>Fuck off, secondary scum.</br>  What is wrong with Kirie? is it just repressed lesbianism or a deep and server autism  Would you use it as an onahole?  <br>I agree the rest of the girls are complete shit especially Kirie I wish she would just get fucked and die already also not looking forward to blue hair eternal #2's episode</br>  <br>Same shitter.</br>  So is next week gonna be Sylphy's episode?<br>Will everyone fall in love with her next?</br>  <br>Yes.<br>Then, hopefully, they'll cycle back around to the Umaru redemption chapters.</br></br>  <br>she seems like a shit character but I will give her a chance but it will be hard to top Ebina.</br>  <br>Ebina is a spineless shit. Literally the Mikuru of this show.</br>  I can't help but skip the parts with Ebina, she's too damn boring and bland.    <br> B-BUT MUH BEWBS </br>  <br> all that shit <br><br>for what purpose<br><br>also<br><br> RWBY </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is Kirie ever going to thank Alex? He's been really nice to her. Or is she going to be Tsun-thorn girl forever?  <br>all the better to get cola from you anon</br>  <br>That's a fucking nice sale</br>  <br>The word you were trying to think of was "young'un"</br>  <br>so what's this with men?</br>  <br>i will remember snacks next time i go to japan<br>what's a youkai?</br></br>  <br>Fun things are fun.<br>Also RWBY is pretty mediocre but the combat scenes are good enough and the soundtrack is 11/10.</br></br>  <br>Sylph starts off as a shit but she becomes the overwhelmingly best not long after she starts hanging out with UMR.</br>  <br>do you think your dick could survive?</br>  Kirie's episode was the best so far, who agree?  <br>It has the fewest annoying Umaru moments of the three</br>  Does Onii-chan wipe her butt when she's home? These are important questions.  <br> Lotus Juice gets another rap in an OP </br>    <br>now give her red m&amp;m's face</br>  Am I the only one that enjoys Umaru's tantrums?  <br>I do, but that's because I'm not the target of them.</br>  <br>get out</br>  <br>I wish he'd shut her up with a good dick in her mouth</br>  <br>I love them so much, I keep rewatching them. Her chibi form and her voice are perfect.</br>  The fact she is literally good at everything while spending every waking moment surfing the net and playing gamers outside of school confuses me.<br>This clishey is actually kinda annoying.</br>  <br>Never underestimate the magic ticket to life known as Talent.</br>  <br>pmt</br>  <br>At the same time you can also agree that Umaru herself became a lot better by the time she started hanging out with Sylph too.</br>  <br>Talent is a made up concept.<br>At best you can have slightly better genetics than someone else and be physically better by a small %.<br>But everything else comes from hard work and dedication.<br>And no mater how talented you are you cant be best at literally everything if you spend 99% of your free time just playing games and doing nothing.</br></br></br></br>  Ebina is the cutest, That banging body.<br>Sexy as fuck dialect.<br><br>Give it to me.</br></br></br>  <br>And as always Lelouch has the worst taste.</br>  Same reason you would have a guinea pig/hamster  <br>talent &lt; effort &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; talent+effort</br>  1) Ebina<br>2) Umaru<br>3) Blue haired sparkle bitch<br>90000000000000000000001) Le autism meme girl</br></br></br>  Do you think Umaru posts on imageboards?<br> &gt;Be at home <br> &gt;Onii-chan gets home <br> &gt;Ask him for Last Fantasy 15 <br> &gt;He says no <br> Why is he so evil?! Do other little sisters have onii-chans like this? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Only your last line is true. Talent is very real, especially with things like academics. If you are born with a better intellect and memory, you will naturally do better in school than those who are less talented, even if you don't spend much time studying at all.</br></br>  <br>She seems like she for sure posts with a trip</br>  <br> &gt;This one girl keeps making weird faces at me <br> &gt;I think she is gay for me and wants to fuck me <br> &gt;What do? </br></br></br>  <br> talent isn't real <br><br>lmao buttmad ""nurture"" beta cuck detected<br>Why don't you get back to spend every waking minute of your life practicing shit that everyone else can do perfectly naturally</br></br></br></br>  I just read all chapters available and holy shit, I can't believe this thing has an actual plot going on.<br> Ebina's   brother leaving his home when Ebina was 7. <br> Umaru's development and realization that she's lying to her only true friends and her onii-chan is way too goddamn nice to everyone <br> Everything about Alex <br> Hikari <br> Why does Umaru live with Taihei? <br> Why the mother flashbacks? Is she kill? <br>So many questions for a 8-pages comedy manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Correct.<br><br>It makes a mockery of her clothing, if she wears any on that day.</br></br></br>    <br>I do, a lot. Her voice is just too perfect.<br> GEEMU GEEMU GEEMU GEEMU <br><br>And the noises she makes when she's shocked (when she sees Erina at the super) or mad (the one she makes before throwing a tantrum at the restaurant). Also, it's always nice to hear "Umaruu-n!" in the background.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gross.</br>  <br>You're gross.</br>    <br>Anon...</br>    <br> tfw you'll never get a cute shy waifu from Akita with big tits and a cute accent. <br>Feels REAL BAD man..</br></br>  <br>Talent is exceedingly real. I can pick up video games I know nothing about and ruin everyone I know 9 out of 10 times. It doesn't matter what genre it is, but if they practice for a few weeks and I don't it'll get more even. That can be applied to virtually anyone at anything. Some people can just slam the shit out of a baseball without even knowing what the fuck is going on. I knew a guy in the military who never played basketball in his life but could do lay ups consistently.</br>  <br>This is why she's worst girl.<br>Disgusting pigslut.</br></br>    <br>Less Umaru being a fucking bitch is always better, so yeah.</br>  <br> those funbags <br>I want to slash them off with a samurai sword and then make fun of her accent.</br></br>  <br> Ebina's accent <br>Too perfect.</br></br>  <br>Lelouch, why you have such a  magnificent  taste?</br>    <br> itt - lies we tell ourselves </br>  I want to  sexualize  ebina  I'm going to marry Ebina-chang  <br>wrong image</br>    <br>Would you still like her if she had small tits?</br>  <br> inverted nipples <br><br>This never gets less weird.</br></br></br>  How often do you think Ebina  masturbates in the shower or with the cat pillow?   <br>l-lewd</br>  <br>Yeah, though she wouldn't be as soft.</br>  Gap moe. Best moe.  <br> niggerniggerniggernigger <br>This always gets me</br></br>  <br>Better question, what does the pillow smell like after 1 week of owning it</br>    I like this show a lot more when I'm not sober  <br>sweat and vegetables</br>  i want to bully umaru    hi guys is this the shitposting anime of the season  <br><br>Plebeian taste. Inverted nipples are hot, faggot.</br></br>    <br>No, you should check out GATE for that.</br>  sharp teeth Umaru!  <br>Taihei is actually kind of unimportant in the grand scheme of things. Ebina and his boss have huge crushes on him (and he thinks the boss is creepy) but that's it. It's more about family love and friendship.<br><br>The author seems to really like hinitng at the two of them getting together but Umaru and Taihei are both vacuums of asexuality so who knows.</br></br></br>  <br>Not even close.</br>  <br> dumb, personality-less moeblob #10432543 is the only reason to watch this series <br><br>i bet you like Onodera too, fucking pleb</br></br></br>  <br>No it's definately Himouto</br>  I find it really funny that huge tits can actually make up for the lack of everything.

The biggest thing holding yuri back is the fact that most yuri artists have terrible sex scenes that are fully censored and last for less than a page. If it's incest, it's a good sign that the artist doesn't view the yuri as "pure" and we'll actually get some hot scenes.</br>  New episode later thread.<br><br>Hamilton a cute.</br></br>  <br> But what about recoil with such shit? <br> Itami used sawed off shotguns against the xenomorphs.

Why. Why saved-off. That's retarded. No, you can't beat up greenass invaders with that shit. And the range is quite short. And reloading time is too long. What the fuck.</br>  <br><br>Well they sometimes get the full package, so it would be much easier to translate the novels from French to English than from Japanese.<br><br>I might even do it  for free </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And there is no reason for a sawn-off to be in the other world, as all firearms are supposed to be JSDF issue, and I doubt they use these.</br></br>  <br>Really, give him Striker.</br>  <br>I cannot remember the model (as my ex-Red Army workmate, Afghanistan veteran showed me webpage with actual photos and videos).<br>The shotgun was designed to stop explosive loaded cars/trucks before they allahu ackbar your road post or camp gates.<br>I guess, vampires and even Rori would shit bricks when see it in action.</br></br></br>  <br>Excellent taste.<br> I think she was possessed by Hardy before. Maybe the extra hair is a power source left behind? <br>You'll have to ask a novelfag.</br></br></br>  Why is MC such a beta? Wouldn't even get it up for 10/10 aspiring love God loli in those hot springs. Get your shit together Itami.  <br><br>To be fair rifles would be absolute shit vs giant bugs. <br><br>Shotguns would work much better.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Flamethrowers would be the best due to their carapace/exoskeleton</br>  Rori already got pretty fucked once when Itami was with the dark elves in the volcano.  <br><br>First it would need to hit. <br><br>A bunch of elite commandos was shooting at Rory with auto fire weapons from all directions and they hit just few times.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do it man.</br>  <br> Wouldn't even get it up for 10/10 aspiring love God loli in those hot springs. <br>He got a phone call before he was about to.</br></br>  Haha, I get it! It's funny because he's still an otaku despite being a military officer! There's such a good contrast between those two perceived stereotypes, lol. Funny!  <br><br>Yeah, because they are such common weapons.<br><br>And I'm sure you would love a 3m long burning bug going your way.

Itami would get ripped apart by explosion but she linked the damage to herself.</br></br>  <br>Now imagine angry burning alien bug bastard running at you. It only wants to hug you, mind you.</br>  <br> I take anime far more seriously than it takes itself: the post </br>  <br>Is she eating her upper lip?</br>  <br>i can't help but see her with black lady lips in that shot</br>  <br>Which basically means that Rori is weak against explosion damage, and probably RPGs.</br>  <br>It's like he doesn't know just how weeaboo some soldiers are. For some reason the air force are most weeaboo.</br>  <br>Is this the waitress that tells the order about the rod of steel?</br>  You know, this would be better if that fantasy world was not super low fantasy. <br><br>As it is they are facing no real opposition. <br><br>Imagine if it was fucking Warhammer and they met a band of Chaos warriors. Or an undead army.</br></br></br></br>  Reminder that OP shows up to Japan adventures arc so we get to see Rori BTFO cunty diet senator.<br><br>So hype.</br></br>  <br> Waitress </br>  <br>No, I think it's one of Pina's close guard/friends that get gang-raped, and then her head cut off and tossed back to her during the siege where Itami first meets/saves Pina.</br>   you'll never chill with your bros in a bar full of fantasy species   <br><br>Itami was caught in a blast that killed the red dragon. You know, the same dragon that survived an anti-tank missile and almost destroyed a F-4.</br></br>  <br>  so we get to see Rori BTFO cunty diet senator. <br>Maybe they won't censor that part.</br></br>  <br>I thought it was the damage that he received that knocked him out and then woke up with that half a dark elf next to him.</br>  <br><br>So is there a lot of rape and shit in this? And what are the chances that it wont get censored of there is any?</br></br>  <br>It was a shit ton of C4, and the dragon was a living pincusion thanks to Lelei.<br><br> the same dragon that survived an anti-tank missile <br>After having its arm torn off.<br><br><br>There's been a lot, and all of it has been censored/removed in the anime so far.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nope. That was one of the city people. You see her fiancee. And she was not raped, they had no time. She took a bolt to the eye while on the wall.</br></br>  <br>There is at least 2 rape scenes that I remember off the top of my head, the siege battle, and then the Prince raping the bunny, and a few more bunny rape scenes, a couple bunny beheading scenes, but they aren't really that graphical, it'll probably be animated with dark/black half off cam censoring.</br>  <br>Depends which medium you're consuming. The manga has plenty of rape, gore and pillaging.</br>  <br>The way I see it is, whatever damage he takes right now is transferred in part to Rori, because of the pact she made with him.</br>  <br> No, I think it's one of Pina's close guard/friends that get gang-raped, and then her head cut off and tossed back to her during the siege where Itami first meets/saves Pina. <br><br>No, that was a militian's wife. Hamilton survives.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's only been 3 episodes and there's already removed stuff?</br></br>  <br>Quite a lot. Worst part is most of it was symbolical and served to establish characters.</br>   Picked the Manga up a while back  <br> Get to where princess is introduced <br> Pina co lada  <br><br>Jesus Christ is it intentional or just nips with shitty English knowledge?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Intentional. The royals of the empire are named after liquor.</br>  <br>The important thing is whether or not sexual feelings are linked.<br><br>.</br></br></br>  Reminder Tyuule does end up with Furuta in the original webnovel.<br><br> Tyuule successfully kills Zorzal and does not get killed.<br>She is betrayed by her henchmen who attempt to sell her to prostitution slavery, but Furuta saves her.<br>Furuta takes her home, makes her his waitress, and they live happily ever after</br></br> </br></br>  I don't understand Itami's strategy during the siege of Italica.<br><br>They had three vehicles, and there were three doors that might be attacked, why not put one team at each and have them warn each other when the attack comes?<br><br>The .50 on the LAV would have made short work of the marauders coming through the door.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Japans likes English words/the language because it has more sounds than Japanese. It's why you see so many shirts in manga/anime with a single English word on them.</br>  <br>we'll see. We'll see. Battle boner activate!</br>  <br><br>It also makes the names of the otherworld people sound exotic to the japanese ear.</br></br>  <br>There were 4 gates, with one side of the fortress already breached, the JSDF were all on that destroyed side, the side where Itami and Rori went out and wrecked people's shit.</br>  <br> it's his boss <br> his sustenance goes out the window if he ignores it <br><br>Common sense confirmed. No pussy is worth getting fired for. Even 900 year old pussy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I know right.<br><br>Imagine if this was just some Stargate copy.</br></br></br>  <br>Make that 900+ year old regenerating goth loli pussy.</br>  <br>It's not like it was a one time deal, either.</br>  <br><br>Given how tame they made the anime, my guess is that if they ever get to that part they'll keep the LN story.<br><br><br><br>They say in the manga that one of the gate cannot be attacked because it's alongside the river, at the end of a bridge. There weren't any guns available at the gate the marauders attacked when it mattered most, during the approach and battle on the walls, I'd say it would have saved many defenders (including Noma).<br><br>But then again it doesn't matter when you solve the problem Kilgore-style with air cav.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was his buddy the Minister of Defense who was in charge of protecting them, it would be pretty stupid to ignore his call, especially when it might be to inform them of incoming danger.</br>  Titty monster  <br><br>Her character is my favorite type of character.<br><br>Fucking A-1.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I thought it was Piña who decided their position, and that she put them on the side where the marauders where most likely to attack.</br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that the author is a faggot for killing off Tyuule for no reason.</br>  So If Rory formed a bond with Itami does that mean if they had sex she'd feel it double?  <br><br>Maybe you're right, but then Itami is still a retard for not explaining how they could make better use of the JSDF on site.</br></br>  <br>Only if Itami was into BDSM.</br>  <br>If Itami's dick was cut off which part of Rory would take the damage? And does the cut off part reattach or does it regenerate out of its own accord?</br>  <br><br>ASKING THE FUCKING HARD QUESTIONS OVER HERE SOMEONE GIVE THESE ANONS AN AWARD</br></br>  <br>They fear that mages turn into fedora tippers.</br>  Itami said they were short on men and put on the side which was already breached once.<br><br>Technically they were placed in the most dangerous side, but the marauders were just being stupid and decided to attack the other side.</br></br>  <br>But she's cuter in the light novels.</br>  <br>She'll probably feel it triple, as she would feel it when people start dying, and then she'll need sex, but then she's also connected to itami.</br>  <br>They look almost the same, unlike the anime.</br>   tfw Rori will never bond you   <br>At first I kept getting the two girls in squad 3 mixed up as the only difference was height and longer/shorter hair.<br><br>I kinda like the anime designs. Pina looks a lot better there IMO.</br></br></br>   strongest Servant   <br>Pray to based True Assassin then because he can pull that off quite easily.</br>  <br>He's also super-weak, so he's probably more suited to Master-killing.</br>  <br>She was charging it in her hand like a megabuster.</br>  <br>Okay but Gil's skin isn't made of diamond, I'm pretty sure assassin can still behead the guy if anything (not that he'll ever get the opportunity though).</br>  <br>In that case it's all fucked, because that brown loli is not going anywhere. Neither is Gil, and that's a shame.</br>  The chinese's version of the episode 00/Prologue is out.
