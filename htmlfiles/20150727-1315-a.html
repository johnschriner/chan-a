He either recognizes what a great scourge Griffith is on the world and seeks to undue him or he want's a new master to follow.</br>  <br>The same reason no one has chest, leg, or armpit hair.</br>  EASY MODO: WRITE THE PREMISE AND THEN ADD WHO'LL ANIMATE IT<br><br>I'll start.<br><br>The story follows an average guy with top grades who currently resides in some small greenish village located in the Japanese prefecture of Mie. He tends to make a lot of friends at school (including his overly cheerful childhood friend) and has an obssession with collecting ancient objects bought by his father from Jerusalem in his own closet room that he couldn't show to anyone else.<br><br>One summer day, things went to hell when he sees the village being incendied for some reason. After trying to find the consequences behind it, he meets a mysterious little girl and a powerful organic-looking giant robot who probably come from another dimension. The meeting will soon begin with fate and incoming darkness that forever changes the protagonist's life.<br><br>Animation Production: ufotable<br>Scheduled for 12 episodes</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But Neo Gainax sucks <br>Look at the premise. Who better for a series that will have a lot of sucking involved?</br></br>  <br>Actually, I tried to make it generic as fuck, but the kiss right from the start tops 95% of anime out there. Ignore that one. They don't kiss and awkwardly dance around feelings for each other.</br>  <br>The Misadventures of Ebola-chan and Friends.</br>  <br>Sounds interesting.</br>  <br>Poor Bosnia.</br>  So can we all agree this is the worst, most blatant wish-fulfillment mary sue fantasy to ever come out of Japan?  <br> 37yr old Baker gets hit by a truck saving the child of his unrequited love <br> He reincarnates in fantasy land and through growing up realizes the food is shit <br> Makes it his life long goal to "conquer" the world with his food <br> The food he uses to wow the first kingdom is the cheesy pull apart bread <br> MC throws out quotes like "Nothing would be more tiresome than eating and drinking if God had not made them a pleasure as well as a necessity. " and "Sex is good, but not as good as fresh, sweet corn." <br><br>Oh. yeah. Uh, magician waifu and dark elf swordswoman that want his dick.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You need a third waifu to balance things out, man. That's just a scientific fact.</br>  There are plenty of stories already  <br>Third waifu is the first kingdom's head chef who goes yandere after tasting his dishes and making it her goal in life to eat everything he makes. Really kind and graceful on the surface but extremely jealous when he cooks for other people or doesn't bring leftovers.</br>  <br> Only three <br>You need to go wild, go for 5 wives or more and not counting the mistresses.</br></br>  What does /a/ think of World Trigger?  As an anime it has a lot of problems, mostly because it's animated by Toei. <br><br>The manga is pretty damn good. I haven't read a battle shounen this engaging in a long time.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but the characters are not very appealing. I mean, they act like robots.</br>  <br>Jin doesn't feel like a main character to me. He's more like a plot device. The author even said as much in his commentary, that writing Jin into the story creates problems.</br>  <br> they act like robots <br>No they don't.</br></br>  I liked the story and action but I ended up just dropping the anime around episode 26. They obviously commissioned way too many episodes for the amount of content so they have to pad the episodes like a mother fucker. This is probably why that ending segment exists that repeats the exact same info that is told during the show. They also sometimes spend up to 30 seconds panning between people's faces and also have unnaturally long pauses between dialogue. I'll probably pick up the manga soon for something to read at work since it seems to be much better paced.   Don't you wish your papa was hot like me?   <br>An angel. Pity she's a whore. What do you call a child between an angel and a human again?<br><br>Where can I find an ostrich human?</br></br></br>  <br> pity she's a whore <br><br>She'll know how to please you better anon, plus once she learns to love, she won't be on the streets anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>  that guy makes an arrangement with the PRC apparently without fully grasping the PRC's intentions. </br>  <br>Itami's a lucky man.</br>  <br>It's okay anon. This girl will grow.</br>  Read the guide before asking questions<br>buyfag.moe</br>  <br><br>ok</br></br>  <br><br>I'll go with MF personally, QQ looks pretty nice, and based on their previews Kancolle figs I know it'll end up fine, but MF is using pic related as source for both Atago and Takao, so they're look awesome together.</br></br>  <br>Nendoroids are for autistic faglovers</br>  <br>That's what is winning me over, that they're obviously being made to pose with both together and if priced reasonably well, I'd pretty much have to get both. It would just be awful to have one but no the other -- feels incomplete.</br>  <br>Scales are for autistic mouthbreathing neckbeards</br>  Do you think Akari is cute?

Is she going to survive the whole thing just for laughs?  <br>She is too weak to oppose anyone besides najenda and maybe leone. Either she gets comidically one shotted by akame/tatsumi. gets killed by the emperor if he goes crazy like in the anime, or actually fucking live.</br>  Chapter 62: Here lies Wave, he never won a battle or his waifu.  <br>Instead of betting on who is going to win, we should bet on how many pages until Wave gets killed.</br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #7<br><br>Remember to relax and take it easy.<br><br>Previous thread </br></br></br></br>  Requesting Toyone being taller than you're waifu  <br>Haruhi is a vampire?</br>  <br>Thanks<br><br>Glad that boosted your mood.
