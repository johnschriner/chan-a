Seeing smaller more compact things triggers our protective instincts, helping us create bonds with babies. This basic instinct helped the survival rate of humans past childhood rise and is a prime reason why we view babies as innocent. Making characters that are smaller, such as lolis, triggers this protection response, making lolis "cute" passively.</br>    <br>Sorry, /a/non, but this is a place for best girl and friends, not tr/a/sh.</br>  Made some OC, but it didn't turn out exactly how i wanted.

Apparently, they are heading to a place where (as Alibaba has told Judar many times by this point) they can find someone with the power to send them back to their world. He doesn’t know where that is, though, as he just heard he had to aim for a rift in the land.  <br> Judar is intrigued by this “I heard it from someone”, and thinks that certainly Alibaba is... but he doesn’t answer his question, and since he can't read Alibaba's non-existent face, he gets really annoyed. <br> They apparently fight, and their fight leads them to: <br><br> Mother Dragon: We have guests, I see? <br> Alibaba: We were looking for you. My name is Alibaba. What’s your name? <br> Mother Dragon: Long forgotten. But you can call me how Solomon did, Mother Dragon. <br><br> Alibaba reminds Judar that she appeared in Aladdin’s tale about Alma Torran, a name the the dragon finds nostalgic. Still, Judar blatantly and rudely asks her to go straight to the point and tell them how to go back. <br> She tells them they are at the “bottom” of the world, and that they came there through a rift in the dimensions. The dragon has been overlooking Solomon’s new world from here, and the black shadow looming over it, which Alibaba explains is what he wants to stop. <br> The dragon exclaims that Alibaba is strange. He is still young, yet has the presence of an old sage. Alibaba tells her that before, when he became a spirit, he spent what seemed like a hundred years somewhere else, and it was there that he heard about the dragon from a certain someone. <br> She then proceeds to explain that it’s funny that they are talking about “going back” when they actually are in their world. Judar immediately dismisses this as a lie, as the rukh there is all black and it’s totally different from their world. She explains however that this is just the old Alma Torran “attached” to the new world. In other words, the Dark Continent (which seems to be about twice as big as the known world). </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When he was born literally everyone in the world felt his presence. He has more magoi then 100 men and something like half a dozen metal vessels.<br><br>He doesn't even have a creative way of fighting like Kouen does to make himself powerful. He's just powerful because fuck it the universe decided it.</br></br></br>  I have a bad feeling about this guys.<br><br>Think about it. <br><br>Mother Dragon.<br><br>Mothers get pregnant.<br><br>Alibaba is currently a soul.<br><br>Mother Dragon needs to give birth in order to become a mother.<br><br>So, in other words, Alibaba requests to be Mother Dragon's son so he willingly launches himself into Mother Dragon's womb and then later hatches out from her egg and is reborn as a Dragon.<br><br>And since this Mother Dragon has dimensional powers, Alibaba will inherit her powers.<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128705903#p128740453">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you implying that Alibaba himself is the incarnation of a soul's sperm?</br>  <br> Veggibaba gets into the hyperbolic time chamber for a powerup  <br><br>lame</br></br></br>  <br>He literally is.</br>  Post underappreciated girl like Nowachin.  <br>It's not from lack of trying, i quite like her.<br><br><br>It's cute to imagine even lazy Agano trying to spoil Sakawa</br></br></br></br>  <br>Try harder. <br> Try as hard as my cock is when looking at Sakawa lewds. </br></br>  <br>Much better now</br>  <br>I'll be looking for her this event.</br>  <br> getting rid of Sakawa  <br><br>For what purpose?</br></br></br>  So Viz finally released a list of theaters in the US that will be playing the movie. It's a total of over 80 cities, with 51 locations announced so far which was a lot more than LAST. Looks like they're anticipating a lot more people. Screenings start Oct. 10 which is also Naruto's Birthday. Hopefully they have some decent giveaways.  <br>The spoilers promised character development and good fights, so no.</br>  <br>Why so angry bro. We all friends here.</br>  <br>  </br>  <br> Boruto <br> Salad <br> Metal Lee <br>God damn Kishimoto. Think about your damn names.</br></br></br></br>  <br> He just wants to be an overpowered traveling hobo like Sauce <br>When is he going to teach him the Uchiha forehead poke of death to use on his daughter?<br><br>Actually, come to think of it, if he did that, it'd be like he was using nardos hand to forehead poke Salad. Her panties would be soaked in an instant. Probably start to erode.</br></br></br></br>  Somehow I doubt this  <br><br>It's not molestation if I'm giving her chest a special massage to help her boobs grow and become a beautiful woman.<br><br>It's not molestation if I wrestle and roll around on the floor with them and give their tender butts a good slap, I just want to encourage girls to become genki tomboys.<br><br>It's not molestation if I take bubble baths with them, I want to make sure they're getting enough magnesium from the bath salts and exfoliating their skin so that they grow up with skin so beautiful they won't feel the need to wear make-up all the time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My bad.<br><br><br>That's just fucking retarded. Not only did they jail the victim, they let a retard loose to continue her antics.<br><br>Well she's twenty now. I hope she really gets raped.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It must be that "tsundere" thing.</br>      H-How? How can BONES make something this good? This is totally going against all the expectations. This adaptation has been fucking great so far. <br><br>Or were the expectations too low to begin with?</br></br>  <br>We should institute some manner of security pass. Like if you don't have some goofy crystal dogtag id, you aren't allowed into these threads.<br><br> I really felt like they glossed over that Palace ID thing really quickly. Who instituted this? When? Why? Who makes the tags? they're clearly some kind of etched glass, which isn't cheap. Shirayuki is an exception and they don't normally allow anyone in without one, but they don't seem to have visitor tags, either? There are some other stories going on here. </br></br></br>  <br>Back off Watari, his LN's are pretty based. <br><br> Second season should never have happened, we used to have great threads and Yahari used to be well respected within the fanbase. </br></br></br>  <br>Is that your genuine opinion?</br>  <br> great threads and Yahari <br>Maybe months of shitposting have deluded me but I don't remember this.</br></br>  <br>When spyro started the translations, between vol 7 until 6.5 (which is after vol 10) If I recall correctly. <br><br>They were LN exclusive, but great threads.</br></br></br>   you will never watch LOGH for the first time again </blockquote>]
