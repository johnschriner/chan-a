[ What is Saki about?  Wearing no panties and just not giving a fuck.  <br>mahjong</br>  Anything but mahjong.  Tanoshii      <br>Lesbian superpower battles disguised as mahjong matches.</br>      Saki is about living her life the only way she knows how. It's like you're always stuck in second gear and it hasn't been your day, your week, your month or even your year. There you have the facts of life. Meet George Jetson!  <br>That wasn't even deep.</br>  <br>Why even wear clothes?</br>  <br>It's lewder that way.<br>If she didn't have any clothes on, it would be trashy.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128383279 <br>Sauce?</br>  <br>I wouldn't say that on /e/ if I were you</br>  きっといつか見える果てまで 笑顔の花咲かせたい  Posting this every thread until the vita game trailer is released.<br>Please look forward to it</br>  Saki is about making you care about characters who are doomed to lose.  <br><br>The depth of Saki is a shallowness in the ocean of despair.</br></br>  <br>Much better.

It could have made for a great match.</br>  <br>Ritz just wanted people to focus on the bullshit powers.<br>Or the lesbians.<br>Probably both, considering Himeko and Mairu.</br></br></br>  <br>"I almost missed the deadline from shading her boobs."</br>    <br><br> Is this show kinda like YnS? <br><br>Well, both Saki and Haruka claim not to be able to swim.</br></br></br></br>  Do you hope an announcement of a new anime this week?  <br> What is Saki about? <br>Cute girls doing cute girls - and mahjong.</br></br>  <br>I fucking love Hajime.</br>  <br>Why would it be this week in particular?</br>  <br>Me too.</br>  <br>I love fucking Hajime.</br>  <br>Boobs</br>  <br>Don't really need the trailer when the game's pre-orders are out.</br>  <br>Mahjong.

Worse than ladies throwing swords out of lakes.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Better, focus the whole thing on Padme. Luke and her imouto were born through virgin birth like jesus. She turns into an ugly old man Vader because of dak side corruption.</br>  <br><br>I think you just saved the series.</br></br>  I just recently watched legendary gambler tetsuya.<br><br>I now realize there are no special powers in saki. They've been simply cheating this whole time!</br></br>  Who has the biggest boobs?  <br>I think unofficially it's Kasumi.<br>Just a guess.</br></br>  <br>Kasumi&gt;Nodoka&gt;Yuuki</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>he's asking if you'd let your son dress like that</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If it fits.</br></br>  <br>Last time I heard that joke I fell off my dinosaur.</br>  <br>The shindouji one is pretty lewd</br>  They are the school with orgasms for power-ups.  <br><br> starts a Saki thread <br> doesn't put tanoshii in the OP <br><br>This thread will go past 500, for sure.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You just have to burn with the fire to keep it alive!</br></br>  <br><br>Okay.<br><br>Saa, kiss an(on) kawaii!</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you sure Nodoka doesn't have someone bigger than her besides Kasumi in the cast?</br></br>  <br>Kasumi's are larger, she even host a goddess inside them.</br>  <br>Yes, if there was someone else we would be getting into the latter half of the alphabet in cup sizes.</br>    <br><br>Look at that smug bastard Etopen.</br></br>  So am I allowed to like Achiga yet?  <br>Maybe Harue, either Mihirogi or Zenno is final boss here. Much probably Mihirogi given that she later turns into Japan team's vanguard. <br><br>Btw what was that creepy shadow with Kyouko? Ikuno gave her powers through molestation?</br></br></br>  <br><br>You're allowed to like the Matsumi sisters, and bowling Toki.</br></br>  <br> sisters <br>Surely you're not implying it's okay to like Kuso.</br></br>  <br><br>You're allowed to like them as a pair.</br></br>  I'm a bit upset. Nobody but Kurosaurus speaks to Yuu and when she does most of the time she's crying. Then that dirty Ako gives her a hug.  I like Ako. She likes fun and games. The dollar decides how far you can go.  <br><br>Yuu is so much like me. Always cold, even in the summer heat and shy.</br></br>   frenchie over China or Georgia <br>Satoha you fool.</br>  <br>AND FAT?

What kind of person was she that playing mahjong with her created players like Saki and Teru?</br></br>  <br>Hisa abuses her power over the library to blackmail Saki into playing mahjong. How nice.</br>  <br>Prepare for Round Two.</br>  <br>Yuuki is summoned from the roof.</br>  <br>Mako will take the 4th spot at the table.<br>Kyoutaro is already being marginalized.</br></br>  <br>Saki is a beast , what holds her down are her traumas and Nodoka keeps pushing her to go further. Meanwhile her sister is creating meaninful moments with her new goldfish. I remember when people thought Teru was the villain.</br>  <br>Mahjong explanations.<br>Playing half of a half of a game.</br></br>  <br>I still don't understand why the seat directions are backwards and counterclockwise.</br>  <br>Yuuki playing at her normal reckless speed.</br>  <br>Taco speed wins.</br>  <br>Hisa set the rules to favor Yuuki and handicap Saki.<br>This will make it more difficult for Saki to break even.</br></br>  i need to download the OST i always forget to do it. The music in the Nationals was so good.  <br>Yuuki winning, but now it's Saki's turn as dealer.</br>  <br><br>I dunno, complete noobs have the benefit of sneaking in Yakuman or two before they even realize it has happened.</br></br>  No matter where you are, whether it's a quarter mile away or half way across the world. You'll always be with me. And you'll always be my little bird.  <br>Everyone's conspiring to beat Saki.</br>  Wasn't there a manga where Ritz was playing mahjong with another guys?<br>I can''t remember the name.</br>  <br>Mako rons Saki; now it's Nodoka's turn as dealer.</br>  <br>So, I watched the first episode of this today, but I don't know anything about mahjong. Should I learn mahjong before watching Saki or am I going to learn about it as the show goes on?</br>  <br>Saki has a great hand, but she's not playing to win.</br>  <br>You'll pick it up as it goes on. (pic related)</br>  <br>... as I just said.</br>  <br>Accurate depiction of the Saki fanbase. I think we should take a poll to figure out which two of us aren't pregnant.</br>  <br>Saki passed up a winning tile to try to break even.</br>  <br><br>Dude no, I watched because lesbians but the characters and their interactions are great Go download it right now.<br><br>Though watching it a second time after you get a better grasp of mahjong is an enjoyable experience too. Someone post that "I think I'm pregnant!" edit pls.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nodoka makes Saki's goal more difficult.</br>  <br>Four posts above you.<br/></br>  <br>buttfucking lolis</br>  <br>Thank you for this, anon. It's been a long time since I've read the first chapters.</br>  <br>Saki needs a difficult winning score in this hand to break even in the game.</br>  <br>There's at least 5 of us here.<br>Four having nice little tanoshii and the other is 1:4.</br></br>  <br>But Saki has a trick up her sleeve.</br>  <br>Nodoka is looking pretty smug here.</br>  <br>This poor girl's motivation for the high school nationals will be feeding her 10 kids. Fucking midget will be broken as hell.</br>  <br>Until she gets out-smugged by Saki. </br>  <br>Saki makes her first kan in the Kiyosumi Mahjong Club. (kan = 4 identical tiles)<br>This is part of her signature move.</br></br>  <br>Saki is boss.</br>  <br><br>NOSTALGIC HYPE.</br></br>  <br>Saki completes her hand from the dead wall...</br>  <br>Here comes the lightning.</br>  <br><br> tsumo <br> rons <br><br>Anon...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>... and that is known as a Rinshan Kaihou.<br>This will be a recurring element of the series.</br></br>  <br>good catch</br>  Why is Saki sucking so much in the current fight? All she does is stare back in shock and awe as everybody beats her up. Her biggest accomplishment so far is literally not bursting into tears when somebody owned her.<br><br>That's kinda sad.</br></br>  <br>The legend begins.</br>  <br>Nodoka is shocked.</br>  <br> super duper luck <br><br>man, it really loses impact when you realize Saki has a superpower that lets her see into the kan pool.</br></br></br>  <br>Everyone reacts.</br>  <br>Eh, necessary secondary powers.</br>  <br>tilted. But the round just started.</br>  <br>Hisa sets a new goal for Saki: Winning<br>End Chapter 2.<br>Taking a break now.</br></br></br>  <br>My personal opinion about the seating is that it used to be regular positioning and clockwise, but was reversed so the arm of the discarding player blocks the next player a bit, giving the others time to react to the discard before rushing into their next draw.</br>  <br>One could say that if you decide that your objective is breaking even, then you win when you break even. <br>Which means that Saki has always been winning, in her own way.</br></br>  <br>I think that Saki is pretending to be scared to psychologically manipulate Kyouko.<br>All of Saki's little frightened poses are a little contrived.</br></br>  <br>Saki was staring daggers when she walked into the room.</br>  <br>seeing in the dead wall (and where the fourth tile of a kan is) doesn't explain +-0.</br>  <br>I think it's more of just her having a really bad poker face.  And being freaked out by Kyouko playing with her feet under the table </br>  <br>Don't forget, by taking her socks off, she's returning her psychological state to when she was little. They're probably serious reactions.</br>  <br>That's Ikuno's tactic.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128416492 <br> All self-respecting anons should ignore this blatant /u/ astroturfing. <br> self-respecting anons  <br><br>anon, please. we all know there's no such thing here.</br></br></br></br>  Since we just reread Chapter 2, let's recall how Saki played Kyouko the first time.  It's been a whale.<br><br>Look at yuu. Fatty. Fatty fat fatso.<br><br>No wonder why you stay all day under a kotatsu.<br><br>How'd you get so fat, them fatty fingers can't even grab the tiles<br><br>Go cry and eat some more cake, fatty fat wide load</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>... and this little pose telling how she "feels" about it.<br>Saki is putting on a show for everyone. [Hands up + teary eyes = fake] But she is in total control.</br></br>  <br>Saki is the shark in the piranha tank.<br>Wait, that doesn't make sense.</br></br>  <br>Teru go to bed.</br>   not Saki: Tanoshii <br><br>Let it toki!</br></br>  I guess that by now eveyone's accepted Rinkai will be in the finals, right?  <br>No, I believe in Magical Demon Slayer Kyouko.</br>  Is it true that Sagimori resembles Ritz?  <br>supposedly</br>  What do you girls expect from shinohayu? will it have a stronger connection with the main series besides the pros? will Shino go to valhalla?<br><br><br>Yes, manga Ritz. If 3d Ritz resembles manga Ritz I wanna invite her to my house so she can fuck my sister.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Right about here was the final moment when Ritz could have been stopped. After this event, she's just been growing more powerful, eating more and higher quality food. Now she's truly unstoppable.</br></br>  <br>I hope that Shino provides a missing link with the Saki-Teru-Goldfish backstory. Shino has a playstyle which is a blend of Teru and Saki. I wonder if they actually met, or if Shino was only an indirect influence.</br>  <br>Nothing can stop Ritz. Except laziness.</br>  Is Ritz actually a lesbian or just pretending to be a lesbian?  <br>This part gives me the creeps.<br>It's doesn't look like they're going to help the person on the cart. It looks like they're going to do evil medical experiments. The person on the right is dressed like a mahjong pro.</br></br>  <br>forgot the pic</br>  <br>Fucking Gilgamesh was Goldfish's dad.<br><br>Also, Hayarin's mom owns a candy store. Teru and family can pay visit there.Both Hayaya and Teru have a tornado arm and play the stupid idol on camera.<br><br>Awai loves sweets as well and I noticed she and Kanna tend to wear star themed clothes and artifacts, though making a connection right now feels a bit over the top.<br><br>Threads ago, someone suggested Shiraitodai and Shino's school might be in the same position during the nationals. About to win for the third time, I think that would be cool.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think that the mahjong pros got pissed when Shino's mom beat Niemann, and forced her into some medical experiment on mahjong mental skills. Maybe Goldfish ended up in the same experiment after (almost?) drowning.<br>Shino's intuition may be right.</br></br>  <br>Also, Goldfish wants to build an aquarium, and...</br>  <br>Yue is an expert on fish.</br>  <br>I'm not sure what it says about Saki that her reaction to "aquarium" was "sushi".</br>  I want to fuck Yuan.  <br>You may force some parallels between Shiraitodai and Shino's school.<br> Before autism hit her Teru appears to be a confident sweet girl like Shino. <br> Overconfident blondie asshole  <br> Mamma who takes care of the fools <br> Fish lover <br>Only issue would be Hayarin that doesn't resemble Takami at all besides TITS.<br><br><br>"I will eat everything you love"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank Yuan.</br>      <br>Cute girls playing mahjong along with a slowly growing sense of foreboding.<br><br>Also falling in love with side characters only to watch their dreams get crushed.</br></br></br>  <br>Why not both?</br>  So, any leaks yet? It's the 22 already...  <br>Nope. Wait til tomorrow. Perhaps the anime announcement will be leaked too.</br>  <br>okay</br>  No Tokis on my watch.  bumping  <br>The Saki from the first volume is leagues different from the Saki of today.<br><br>I think she literally regresses to being more childlike when into mahjong especially taking into consideration her tics to maintain a good mahjong mentality(taking off shoes and socks).</br></br></br>   tfw lost all my Teru pictures <br><br>This is torture.</br></br>  <br>Some things that are lost can never be retrieved, so be careful to not lose them in the first place.</br>  <br>It's a long time to Teru day.</br>  TeruSaki  monitor for news/leaks:<br>http://may.2chan.net/b/futaba.php?m<wbr>ode=cat<br>http://www.saki-anime.com<br>http://www.sciasta.com/ritz/</br></br></wbr></br>  <br><br>The cruelest monsters come in the cutest packages.</br></br>  <br>Champions take every day and make it their own.<br><br>They are so great that others cannot help but praise you every day.

The Teru in the picture gives off a completely different vibe than what we actually got.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, I did save a few. Google translated the thread for a laugh, as expected it's mostly gibberish.</br></br>  <br><br>Teru always had that "merchant's smile" for the presses.</br></br>  ITT: We give Aislinn what she deserves.  <br>Oh, there's an even bigger shot on chapter 4.<br><br><br>It's just hard for me to imagine her cheerful. Though I guess that might just be Saki threads and Biyori jading me.</br></br></br></br>  Life is full of reasons to be happy, like pudding and...more pudding?  <br><br>Flashback Teru seems like such a gentle sister. Makes you really wonder what happened to cause the falling out.<br><br>Also, the uniform in those pictures is way different from the uniforms we got. Since it lists her age, she's definitely in high school so that should be the Shirotodai uniform.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't Sumire call her out on it after their press conference? Teru's as fake as can be when the press is concerned.</br>  <br>My memory's quite foggy, but I do recall something like that.<br><br>I guess I'll just see when I get to that chapter again.<br><br>Though the fact Teru is good at acting two faced seems ironic when you consider her motif.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What about her leitmotif?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ph3<wbr>PM6fRGwY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  Early manga Saki really is drastically different. This is her right after she threw a game to Yuuki in chapter 4.<br><br>That look of maternal contentment in letting another person win. Such a drastic difference from the demon.<br><br><br>That's literally just a final boss theme, nothing two-faced about it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>When the final boss is the first encountered, there is no need for a second level.</br></br>  You can clearly feel Ritz's designs morphing as the series went along. That shadow Koromo looks terrible.<br><br>I wonder if the nopan thing was something she always intended from the start.</br></br>  Huh, Saki's always had a penchant for long skirts and Nodoka likes maid cosplay.<br><br>While the long skirt thing turned up again, it's a shame we've never gotten Nodoka cosplaying again.</br></br>  Saki with her eyes wide open in panic and caution is an expression you don't quite get nowadays.  Saki was originally a story about Saki realizing her love for her friend Kyoutarou. She would chase after him, while he chased after Nodoka. Mahjong was merely a sub plot.<br><br>Then Ritz was ron'd be a triple yakuman online. She never felt anything like it. She needed to express the feeling of tanoshii through manga.</br></br>  <br>Actually look back up the thread, we got Saki panicking recently as well.<br><br><br>That face is a far cry from the fact I just posted. I really think she regresses to a childlike state of mind when playing mahjong now.</br></br></br></br>  Huh, Fujita was the first to cuck a deadwall draw from Saki in the manga.  And possibly the first instance of crying and scared Saki in the manga.<br><br>Fujita pro was really intimidating early on.</br></br>  Guess that answers my earlier nopan question.  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Lesbian <br><br>Yuriproject doesn't think so. Why else would they drop it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, Teru's a wall. Not even her sister can reach her, let along her friends. At her school her behavior's probably more transparent as it appears that she doesn't many fans there, those girls at the hallway are all Sumire's fans according to Ritz. <br><br>Makes you wonder what kind of relationship she had with goldfish cause her death probably trigerred her autism, or if Awai's the actual goldfish resurrected via voodoo magic as she got answers just with a gay stare. <br><br><br>iirc her motif was "sunshine", or related to weather conditions like a teru teru bozu, that's why she's protrayed calm and collected at the rooftop where she can feel the wind in peace, and also the reason why she has a tornado arm in attack mode (bad weather). Her mirror power was because she's part of Amaterasu. I'm not sure though, I'm five yakumans behind my tanoshii certificate.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They probably have no taste, or are all secretly straight or something.</br></br>  <br>When the official anime page drops the yuri tag you have my permission to bitch.</br>  <br> chupame la concha <br>Sí por favor.</br></br>  <br>demon killing</br>  If Saki reversed the genders so it's mostly guys would it be as popular?  Post the mahjong guide fags.  <br>Maybe even more popular. Gotta get that fujo dosh</br>  <br><br>What do you think you are, some kind of comedian?<br><br>Well, your jokes aren't funny.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not the same kind of fans for sure, but still decent sales because fujo strong. <br><br>Or just genderbend half of the cast, each pair has one girl that you can point out at and say "yeah she wears the richii stick in the relationship".</br></br></br>  <br><br>That's Shiromi as a man??</br></br>  <br>during a free day at the nationals, she tried the maid uniforms of Touka's maids.</br>    <br>Look at Touka, driven mad with lust.<br><br>Who will protect Nodocchi?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Soon those revolting blobs of flesh will be mine.</br></br>  <br>Hajime sweat drop is removed (or barely visible?).<br><br>And if I remember correctly they censored her in the third panel in .<br><br>Hmmm, I need to rematch the episode, didn't find screenshots online.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Touka, what are you going to do with that large bag?</br></br>  Here comes the pain  Saki gets possessed with the soul of her dead friend when she becomes evil saki.  <br>Holy crap Ako is flat</br>  Why can't I tsumo? Don't I win now?  <br><br>KILL THE DEMON</br></br>  <br>No multiplier means that you have no yaku. A list of the yaku can be found further down in that site.</br>  <br>Dont worry anon, Sakisan will come through near the end with a line asking if Kyouko knew if she was really playing the game or being played by the game follow by a big hand finisher</br>  <br>You have nothing worth points, aka yaku.<br>For example having all your tiles be of one suit is worth some points.<br>Or having all your combos involve either a 1 or 9, if both of your tiles were nines you'd be shitting points right now.</br></br></br>  <br>Dammit, the thing just said I win with four sets and a pair. So I actually have to win, and get some yaku junk? Would be nice if the game actually explained stuff.</br>  <br>It's about not losing.</br>  <br>it said you can call stumo <br>you can only call stumo on Fully concealed hand.</br></br>  <br>Yes. The yaku determine how many han your hand has, and thus how many points you receive for winning with it.<br>A general rule is to keep your hand closed (don't call tiles) so you can call riichi, unless you can call to form a yaku. Most yaku only exist when your hand is closed, and the others can be open or closed..</br></br>  <br><br><br> Saki <br> Yuri <br><br>We've been over this girls. Tacos is with Sugar. Ritz agreed. Don't bother Yuri Project about it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sugar? She's stealing my sweets? This shall not be allowed.</br></br>  What does Toki drink?  <br>Teru's so perfect. <br><br>Dragon juice.</br></br></br>  <br>Most yaku exist in open hands, but some of the most common or get their han value down or are invalid with open hands.<br><br><br>The game is quite simple, if it's just about winning a hand.<br>You have 2 rules for all and any hand be able to win.<br>1 - The hand must be valid and be ready.<br>I mean, that thing about four sets and a pair (there are two exceptions for this, but don't mind now). About the "being ready" part is what we call "tenpai".<br>2 - The hand must accomplish at least one yaku.<br>The easier way to explain what a yaku is, is comparing it with "poker hands", as even those are called yaku in japanese. For now, just keep in mind that yaku is some kind of a special pattern that gives points (multiplier) to your hand.<br><br>You may call "ron" or "tsumo" when the first rule is accomplished. "ron" is what you call when you win your hand through the discard of an opponent. "tsumo" is what you call when you win your hand by self draw.<br>But, you can't win if the second rule is not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is it time for more mahjong lessons?    Toki, do you ever feel like you're being watched from far far above?  Let the thread die for now. We'll make a new one when leaks come out.  <br>Saki Chapter 3!<br/></br>  <br>Saki being Saki.</br>  <br>Saki plays for moral victories, not real ones.</br>  Why does Saki spit when she talks?  <br>Hisa setting new rules to further handicap Saki.</br>  <br>Saki has everyone's attention.</br>  <br>Double riichi for Saki.</br>  <br>Ippatsu tsumo win for Saki.</br>  <br>Nodoka strikes back.</br>  <br>Not playing against Hitler in mahjong and thus the inferior mahjong animu, for one thing.<br><br>Also no pantsu or some bullshit and I fucking hate that.</br></br></br>  <br>Nodoka wins another hand.</br>  <br>Nodoka pulls far ahead of Saki.</br>  <br>As in Chapter 2, Saki needs another miracle to break even.</br>  <br>Here it comes.</br>  <br>Can you handle the excitement?</br>  <br>Saki gets another kan, and...</br>  <br>BOOM! Suuankou. Don't even need to call the rinshan kaihou, because...</br>  <br> Hisa(!)'s face <br>And people still say they like Ritz's old art better.</br></br>  <br>... that's a yakuman. (Highest possible scoring hand)</br>  <br>Saki broke even again ... or did she?</br>  <br>Hisa lied. There was no handicap. <br>Saki actually won the match.</br></br>  <br>Saki can't believe it.</br>  <br>doki doki</br>  <br>Saki's starting to feel the tanoshii.</br>  <br>If Hisa had known what she would unleash that day, I wonder if she still would have?</br>  <br>Nodoka is NOT feeling the tanoshii.</br>  <br>Hisa delivers the books that Saki wanted, but only if she joins the club.<br>Now Saki needs to find Nodoka.</br></br>  <br>Saki explaining her actions to Nodoka.</br>  <br>This might have been the first use of the word tanoshii in the manga.</br>  <br>But in Chapter 1, Saki said she didn't like mahjong.</br>  <br>Nodoka walks away. First mention of Zenkoku tournament.<br>Saki goes home. We meet her dad.</br></br>  <br>Keep the mahjong table for when mom and sister come home.<br>We've been waiting for 10 years. Someday we may see this table again in happy times.</br></br>  <br>Saki's sister Teru is featured in a mahjong magazine. (as seen above <br>)</br></br>  <br>Saki officially asks to join the Kiyosumi Mahjong Club.<br>Hisa approves.</br></br>  <br>Does Nodoka approve?</br>  <br>Maybe we'll find out...</br>  <br>... in the next chapter.<br>End Chapter 3.</br></br>  <br><br>Can you imagine if books DID run away crying?</br></br>  <br><br>We've seen her father. We've seen her sister. We've seen her goldfish.<br><br>When will we see mom?</br></br></br></br>  <br>She'll be the final boss.</br>  <br>You can tsumo even in furiten.</br>  Has anyone else checked the futalog lately?<br>It looks like all of the saved Saki threads were deleted.</br>  <br>I kind of want Kyouko x Sakisan to happen. They go better together than Nodotits x Sakisan.</br>  <br>Saki x Teru and Awai x Kyoutaro OTP.</br>  <br><br>Beloved couple!</br></br>  <br><br>When and how will they meet? Will it be after the finals, or before?</br></br>  <br>It's about Tanoshii being alive and well.</br>  <br> 100 million mahjong players <br><br>This is complete bullshit, right?</br></br></br>  <br>No, welcome to the 21st century. Welcome to the glossy future.</br>  <br>According to the experts Saki takes place in 2050 where iPS, demons, aliens, super powers and no panties are the rule. We were born too soon.</br>  <br>not childhood friends?</br>  <br>No anon, we were born in time to raise that next generation of mahjong players.</br>  <br>Saki x Nodotits OTP. I will fite you.</br>  <br>When I miss the leaks I check the futaba catalog and there's always a thread in baidu with more or less the same pics.<br><br><br>I like Himematsu because of its metaphoric balls. Experienced teams usueally put the overpowered turbo dykes as vanguard and captain.<br> Teru and Awai <br> Jindai and Kasumi <br> Toki and Toki's tighs <br> Satoha and Nelly (Satoha ain't monster but damn she's likely the strongest "normal" in the series so far) <br><br>Himematsu put the unexperienced bomber and her bully in those positions. In a better world they get a spin-off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Quite a feature don't being a monster and yet being the 3rd better high school player in Japan.</br>  <br>Nodotits is boring as fuck. Anyone else x Saki is way more interesting.</br>  Is Awai supposed to be a good mahjong player? Or is she just there for looks since Teru typically takes someone at the table down to 0? Because she had such incredible stupid fucking play and is a big cause of the Shitchigas advancing.  <br><br>I just think that those two could have fun together, that's all.</br></br>  <br>She's supposed to be. Actually, she's supposed to be the second best player in Shiratodai, but... yeah.</br>  <br> Is Awai supposed to be a good mahjong player? <br>Yes, you may say that it's just like in Nodoka's case. Cute face and popular with the people but you also get confirmation from people like data freak FutaQ.<br><br> is she just there for looks since Teru typically takes someone at the table down to 0 <br>Teru used to be captain, their current strategy is new and pretty sure she trust Awai, if that trust is emotional beacause a new goldfish thing or well grounded we might see later. <br><br> big cause of the Shitchigas advancing. <br>Achiga won because plot demanded their victory. The captain round was more of a clusterfuck because Ritz rushed the conclusion so every captain got a horrible development. Ryuuka got worst treatment imo. Remember the anime got announced around chapter 3<br><br>Fuck, I pray every day a big earthquake doesn't hit Japan in the next 20 years.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We are living in the dawn of a new age.</br>  <br>Achiga was a mistake. The only reason it exists is so Ritz could shoehorn her favorite pair of boobs even more.<br>The show would have been more interesting if it was from the point of view of Shiraitodai.<br><br>There's a lot of things that they could expand on for Shiraitodai, unlike Achiga.<br><br>- Teru/Sumire's past victories<br>- Internal matches to select the teams<br>- Awai's backstory (how she got so close to Teru, etc)<br>- How the fuck Seiko got on the team<br><br>And that's not even touching Teru's motivations/feeling regarding Saki.<br><br>Instead, we got Achiga, which didn't have much going for them.<br><br>- They were Nodoka's friends<br>- Shitrue got rekt by Grandmaster</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Achiga was a reboot that used cute easily marketable characters to get back interest in the series. <br>Shiratodai is sadly not that type of characters. Yes Teru is cute but she's not for that sort of role.</br></br>  <br>The only uncute characters in Shiraitodai are Sumire, who's supposed to be the cool type, and Seiko. No idea what the fuck Ritz was thinking on that one.<br>Harvest Toki is literally the same as Bowling Toki. Awai and Teru are cuter than any of the characters in Achiga. <br><br>Plus, they're not shit at being friends like Achiga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Harvest Toki has glasses!<br>And she drinks tea!<br>Completely different to Bowling Toki.</br></br></br>  <br>It's hard to explain but Achiga design and characterwise works much better than Shiratodai. <br>Do you know what I mean?</br></br>  <br>They look more like protagonists, I guess.<br>Seriously, Shiraitodai just give off this "boss battle" feeling. Too bad they didn't live up to it.</br></br>  <br> didn't live up to it <br>Teru. <br>Also the fact that Shiratodai got mostly beaten in the semis means they'll mean business in the finals.</br></br></br>  <br>I meant Shiraitodai as a whole.<br>Teru inspires equal feelings of fear and awe, like a good final boss should.</br></br>  <br>Shouldn't a number of those be saved for the main story?</br>  <br>Having the Shiraitodai team selections alone would have made a more interesting story than Achiga.</br>  <br>As a fan I agree, but in reality that wasn't the point of Achiga in the first place.</br>  <br>Shiraitodai in general is just an interesting school.</br>  <br>I don't understand how some teams have dozens of players fighting for spots on a team, while other teams (Kiyosumi: ) accept walk-on newcomers.<br>Yet still, on the big clubs they still have bad players in the starting five.</br></br>  <br>teru's team is full of burdens<br><br>it's even worse than kazekoshi's pile of training weights</br></br></br>  <br>Because there are renowned 'mahjong schools' that people tend to go to if they want to play mahjong in high school at high level. Kiyosumi wasn't a mahjong school.</br>  <br>Just having the show be in Shiraitodai's point of view alone would already have made the show a lot better.<br><br>- The main team actually losing to some no name scrub<br>- Kuro peeing her pants would have been more bearable. In the main show, her reasons for not discarding dora was brought up only during the match. For a main character, that's pretty bad. But for a side character, it would have been more acceptable.<br>- Since we won't see any of Achiga's training, their ass pulls wouldn't really be ass pulls.<br><br><br>The point of Achiga was for Ritz to expand on Nodotit's past. Her childhood friend(s) could have been in any school and it wouldn't have made a difference. Replace Seiko with a new character (Nodotit's friend) and it would have been better than Achiga.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> on the big clubs they still have bad players in the starting five. <br><br>In Shiraitodai case it's because they have several teams and they pick the best team, they don't form the best possible team from all the available members.<br><br>Also I wouldn't call Sumire, Awaii, and Harvest Time weak. Even Seiko has an useful ability.<br><br>Senriyama? Toki, Sera, FunaQ, and Ryuuka are good players, and Izumi is according to her previous results a strong first year player - but she got destroyed in her match. <br><br>Rinkai? No weak player, perhaps Hao since she doesn't know how to play well riichi mahjong.<br><br>Himematsu? Well, here I don't see any really weak player, but also no really strong player. That's probably the weirdest team of them all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Thing is you can't have something like the main rival team's backstory for a spin-off. That shit's too relevant and saved for the main story which is what we are getting. Yes Ritz's pace is snail speed but that's a different issue. <br><br>And if we got achiga as a no name team just dumped in the semis we will have to bare their flashbacks in the finals. Their backstories are fine but they also pale in comparison to what Shiraitodai can offer like this anon listed <br><br><br>Hello my name's Ichigo, please adopt instead of buying, Thanks.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Achiga's backstories aren't really necessary in the finals since most of them are show in the semis already.<br>And look, Shiraitodai didn't get any back story, and most people here already like them.</br></br>  <br>Is that Nodoka in Tsuruga's uniform?</br>  <br>Does that look like a K cup to you?</br>  Just remember that there's a 100% chance of the Shinohayu anime being announced during the next thread.  <br> Nodoka <br>That's Chachanon aka Ichigo Sasano, the girl that was hit by Hiroe's Honrouto. This is Nodocchi.</br></br>  <br>Prepare to be disappointed then.</br>  <br>I know.<br>If it's not on the 25th our next chance at a new anime I guess is the 10th anniversary next year.</br></br>  <br>I'm having trouble visualising a K-cup.</br>  LEAKS ARE COMING <br>Should we make a new thread?</br>  Next Biyori is  cats .

I love Guts' face in that scene when hes like "How can you not feel anything?!"<br>I feel that feel Guts<br>Fucking little bitchboy that abused godmode after he got rekt<br>Griffith did  EVERYTHING  wrong</br></br></br>  <br>anyone going to actually typeset it though?</br>  <br>It was translated by a guy on SkullKnight.net.<br><br>http://f5.s.qip.ru/1a7On1iCK.png<br><br><br>Rakshas pls go</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>just imagine if this actually happened. Guts would go fucking insane.</br>  <br> fanslated on /a/ <br> implying [Evil_Genius] aren't fans too </br></br>  Did Griffith purposely sell his ass to Gennon so that years later when he attacked Doldrey his obsession with Griffith would affect his battle tactics allowing Griffith to capture the castle?<br><br> just as keiaku </br></br>  <br>Oh shit, is Griffith gonna rain hell down upon Locus and Rakshas for this shit?<br>Griffith is obviously not the one who issued the order to kill Rikert, he dont give a fuck wether he leaves or stays.</br></br>  <br>It was casuality, but how the fuck would Griffith know dude? He was just a regular human back then, he couldnt see the future.</br>  <br>I hope there is some sort of prophecy or contract Rakshas has to fulfill about never letting Griffith be hurt, and Rickert just shit all over it.<br><br>I wonder what the consequences will be.</br></br></br>  <br>they are so cute, I hope they get together soon</br>  Does Gutt´s JRPG party know about his history and he went through? I don´t fucking remember if he ever told anyone  <br>It already happened when Griffith made sweet love Casca during the eclipse.<br> Guts is literally a cuck who got raped by a nigger. </br></br>  someone explain falconia for good, please  <br><br><br>GRIFFITH!!!!</br></br></br>  <br>No they don't, besides Schierke who has seen glimpses of the eclipse in his psyche.<br><br>There's one point where Isidro sperges out about how great the commander of the hawks raiders was, he asks Guts "Didn't you used to be with a mercenary group." and he says something like "Doesn't matter."</br></br></br>  <br><br>He didn't plan that far ahead. At the time, Griffith was feeling guilt for letting a kid in his army die, and that gave him the initiative to sell his body for supplies.</br></br>  I wonder how Griffith's parents look like.    Where can I read 338 in English?   mfw waited a long time for the new chapter  <br> mfw there are people who have been following Berserk since the 90's  <br> mfw some people died waiting for It  <br> mfw I didn't wait one fucking day </br></br></br>  <br>None but Schierke. There have been hints here and there of people knowing about his past but not knowing exactly who he is, like Isidro looking up to Guts without knowing it was Guts ()<br><br>We also see in the Falconia chapters that many of the other side characters remember Guts but none of them share that they know exactly who it is, it's actually a nice bit of dramatic irony to see all of Guts' actions throughout the series come together with many people not knowing it's actually him. I imagine "soon" some of the party members will learn more about Guts' past, if they ever go to elf island.</br></br></br>  I think pick knows what happened to Guts. Hope his party finds out eventually. <br>Will mermaid girl join the party?</br>  <br>Puck*</br>  The JRPG party is going to die in some horrible fucked up way, just letting you all know right now.  <br> If they ever go to elf island </br>  Where's the anon who was translating the chapter at?<br>http://imgur.com/a/SFZqV/layout/blo<wbr>g</wbr></br>  <br>No</br>  <br> Everyone in Guts' party dies, and Griffith rules happily every after. The End. </br>  <br>Being Guts is suffering</br>  how come the manga is only 20 pages or so&gt; someone told me the new chapters were supposed to be 100 plus pages each?  <br>the 100 pages thing was just for recap</br>  <br>Its 21 pages of new material, the other 79 were the previous chapter re-released to refresh readers memory. Also its only this month not every month. Read closer anon.</br>  Isn't it mind boggling to you guys just how young Guts, Caska and Griffith are? They're only in their very early 20's.  <br>Puck knows. Not only was he getting images of what happened from Guts' mind for a while, he was also there when Guts told Rickert about the Eclipse. He's also met the five, not that they left much of an impression on him.<br><br>Schierke sort of knows. She understands the process behind the brand of sacrifice and the meaning behind it. And, like Puck, she's seen images of Guts' memory. She hasn't heard the details straight from Guts like Puck did, though.<br><br> No one else is aware.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't Griffith way older than Casca though?</br>  <br>Probably 3 or 4 years older at the most.</br>  <br>Griffith is like 30, guts is 24 or so, Caska I suppose is 25-28.</br>  <br>Nah Guts is 25-30, and Griffith and he are the same supposedly the same age. <br> Griffith was quiet a bit older than Casca when he rescued her. Maybe 20? </br></br>  <br>No...</br>  <br>Owen recognized him and even spoke with him about it.</br>  <br>Griffith is 26, Guts 22, Caska 21 or 20.</br>  <br>What is there to explain? It's the ancient city of Gaiseric except bigger.</br>  <br>That is just false dimwit.<br>Guts is like 20 when he fights Griffith and leaves the band. Then he fucks of for a year, making him 21, he rescues Griffith and Eclipse happens, he then runs around for two more years making him 23. Further journeying all over midland BY FOOT, which takes a long ass fucking time mind you, would make him close to 24 or so now.<br><br>Caska is saved by Griffith when she is like 12 or something, and Griffith is already an adult. Following the same timeline Griffith should be above 30 years old by now and Caska is older than Guts or so we can presume, making her atleast 25.<br><br>How the fuck do you reach the conculsion that they are that young?</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> How long do you think the manga will go on before it goes on a fucking hiatus again? <br><br>When we get the next boat.</br></br></br>  <br> put your grasses on <br>eberytiem</br></br>  <br>I keep seeing this picture of Locus, is it from the new chapter?</br>  <br>yes<br>he craves griffiths bp</br></br>  <br>Yes, and it makes one hell of a template.

I've been trying to forget this show.</br>  Downloading. I'll tell you in ~25 minutes.   The only thing I remember from this show is pic related being the best girl <br>I hope it's just a fanservice OVA, a plot-related one would be boring to watch.</br>  <br>Oh shit, I didn't know this was getting an OVA.<br><br>I hope it gets subbed.</br></br></br>  Will yuzuki get some tits now? She went flat as fuck in the last episode.  Nope, no service, dropped.  <br> Sherlock Noel <br> no service </br></br>  <br>Shit, it was only 11 minutes with OP and ED.<br><br>Anyway, Yuzuki admires Kirigon and wants to borrow the DVD with the movie from local library or whatever. The movie itself is pretty rare with only a few copies so there's only one there and someone always keeps it. She sees Shione and believes she hides the secret of Kirigon. They gather and decide to tail her Milky Holmes style. They see her buying lots of food and sweets in particular in a supermarket and think that it must be for Kirigon. They see her going to the place near the lake where Kirigon appeared in the movie and think she intends to summon it. Noel falls into the lake and their cover is blown. Shione says that the food is for her because she likes it. Yuzuki asks why the fuck she never returns the movie and she runs away. Later Nonoka remembers that she had a DVD with the movie and they all watch it. In the DVD  loli Shione is seen staring in the movie saying "save me, Kirigon! <br><br>tl;dr Shione is fat.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yuzuki asks why the fuck she never returns the movie and she runs away <br>Sounds like a funny scene.<br><br>  Nonoka remembers that she had a DVD with the movie and they all watch it <br> they all watch it <br>Come on.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, she gets all embarrassed.<br>All without Shione. Shione watches the copy she borrows from the library in her home alone, while cuddling with enban dakimakura.</br></br>  Subs when?<br>Yuzuki best girl.</br>  <br>I am glad this wasn't popular since avoid /a/noying things</br>  <br>Time to download it.</br>  <br>hnnngh<br>I had forgotten how delicious their legs were.<br> Saucers welcome! </br></br></br>    <br> detective episode <br><br>Nice</br></br></br>  <br>Is it finally time for cute girls doing cute things , but without bullshit drama?</br>  <br>Who is this doinker saucer?</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>No idea, she's wearing a disguise.</br>  Oh fuck, I wanted to forget about this shit.

Bullying confirmed  <br>  Imagine making her a slave of the D so hard that you actually cure her from her mind break </br>  <br> For now. </br>  First half was mostly anime original but I liked it for seeing more Megu. I still don't understand why they put in Miki from the beginning and now they're doing her story next episode. It's not like she did much until this point they could have just held off on her until now.  <br>Just for the sake of introducing everyone as quickly as possible, I assume</br>  <br>You just need to put a baby in her and then she'll have someone real to take care of.</br>  Why is people complaining about Gurashi as a general but /a/ always has the "it's time" "ai" threads up?  I'm glad its not just a straight adaptation, but I'm worried all of the changes will result in something shit later.  <br>Nah.</br>  <br>It means they can start the next episode with the flashback to her and her friend in the mall without the anime-only crowd wondering who the fuck she is.</br>  Are the 1080p version an upscale is it actually 1080p?  <br>So are pages 9-10 really missing?</br>  <br>Homo threads aren't generals, they're every few days.</br>  <br>They're retarded</br>  <br>"It's time" threads are not generals, they are sporadic.<br>"/ai/ - idle activities" are not generals, even though they look like one and the threads are circlejerks, but they are actually a group of people talking about anime that nobody translates and are not popular enough to get separate threads on /a/</br></br>  <br>No someone fucked up.</br>  <br>They're usually upscales from &gt;720p (like 960p(?)).<br><br>Depends on the show.</br></br></br>  <br>Can someone translate them?</br>  <br>Homo threads aren't always up.</br>    Have we figured out why Yuki's wearing a different uniform than Rii and Kurumi, by the way?  Shh gurachos are  durmiendo   <br>She just has.</br>  <br>Muy bueno</br>  <br>It's their school's equivalent of a dunce cap.<br><br>Hence the bullying.</br></br></br>  <br>No, /ai/ threads are generals, just for little girl shows. Aikatsu, Pripara, Jewelpet. And they do get translated.</br>  <br>What's this?</br>  Was great, really my favorite show of the season.  <br>There seemed to be a lot of interest in the show from the beginning, but now everyone seems to have suddenly dropped it? What happened?</br>  I wonder if anime only friends have spotted the next twist yet. Though they haven't showed many clues and the anime actually downplayed one of them already compared to the manga.  <br>But her whole class has that uniform.</br>  <br>What are you talking about? We have generals every day.</br>  <br>Niconico views or something, at least that's what I think it is.<br><br>GG is at the top</br></br></br>  <br>I guess it took a moment for the thread to pick up.</br>    mall "flashback" next? Or something new?  <br>But it has the fastest threads, along with GATE and Shimoneta.</br>  <br>They're the F-class. <br><br> Yuki is double F. </br></br></br>  <br>It's only people who aren't used to /a/. Seasonal anime that are popular have threads that are always up even if they don't call themselves general threads.</br>   itadakimasu  <br> let's dig in </br>  <br>I don't understand why they're still going to the mall if the plot point there has already been done.</br>  <br><br>GOMIIIIIIIIN~</br></br>  <br>Hopefully. Let's hope they don't cut out the girls having fun though.</br>  <br>These actually are generals though.</br>    I just watched the episode, it was really good. <br><br>Why there are people shitting on it again?</br></br>  <br>It's going to be tricky to maintain the Megu-nee illusion if they have a flashback and Kurumi is the one driving her car.<br><br>Unless they switch it so Megu-nee is still alive at that point.</br></br></br>  <br> sho ga nai <br> oh, very well. </br></br>  <br>It's not literally 100% the same as the manga.</br>  <br>Would you rather have a common table prayer? <br> itadakimasu <br> Oh give Thanks to the Lord for He is good, for his mercy endures forever. </br></br></br>   THEN WHO WAS FLASHLIGHT   Shovel a Cute  <br>The flashlight never existed.<br><br>IT'S ALL IN HER MIND</br></br></br>  <br>Does she have a ballsack?</br>  Just posting here  <br> 1 bottle for yuuri <br> 1 for the dog <br> 2 for the other 3 girls <br>Spot the alcoholics</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>So what?<br><br>After gg anime ends, these thread are going back to manga only (maybe) and are going to be posted weekly/ every time there is a new chapter</br></br></br></br>   Why is the dog still there?

It's not that kind of series.<br><br><br>Fuck off Lelouch.</br></br></br></br>    Karma won.  <br>thank god nagisa is such a fucking moralfaggot he deserved to lose</br>  According to the summary on baidu - Karma submits to Nagisa and thus the red team lose by surrender. Save team wins but Nagisa suggests they compromise so they will spend 1 month focusing on saving, and if there are no leads or results then all their effort will go strictly to assassination.  <br>Thank you based chink.</br>  Nagisa is a fucking faggot anyway<br> Koro tells his dramatic backstory  <br> flatout says that he won't feel accomplished unless students actually manage to assassinate him  <br> Nagisa: DURRH URRR LETS SAVE HIM </br></br></br>  Thanks for the spoiler fucking retard  <br> Karma submits to Nagisa <br>Good, they finally figured out whose snake is bigger.</br></br>  <br>They will "assassinate" his lafe as octopus.</br>  I'd make Nagisa submit if you catch my drift  <br>Nah they will assasinate his dignity</br>  <br> Karma submits to Nagisa <br>The fuck? Why does this shit happen? Fuck Nagisa and all his muh save the octopus moralfaggotry, damn I'm mad</br></br>  <br><br>I long gave up on a chance of any actual killing done in a manga with 'Assassination' in its name</br></br>  <br>I've had my yearly share of mad when Slain lost da Aldnoah. It's your turn now.</br>  <br>It's finally over<br>I can't wait for the Karasuma chapter</br></br>  <br> Karma submits to Nagisa <br>Lewd</br></br>  <br>oh yeah, because the personal wish of a person is ALWAYS the better choice for them<br>i hope you are never responsible for the life of another person</br></br>  <br> Karma submits to Nagisa <br>What? Why?</br></br>  <br> implying you wouldn't </br>  <br>He wants the snake</br>  <br>Why is Nagisa covering his chest?</br>  <br>I dont understand, really. Throughout the whole story, the kids practically never tried to kill the teacher. The only significant attempt was in the arc of the island. And the fans didn't care, they said that "if you are reading because of the assassination you're reading for the wrong reasons." Then Nagisa doesn't want to kill, but to save the teacher, and the readers get angry. WTF!</br>  <br> draw a girl <br> call it a guy <br> everyone says he looks like a girl <br> another guy gets the hots for him in a dress <br>FUCKING JAPAN</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And the fans didn't care, they said that "if you are reading because of the assassination you're reading for the wrong reasons" <br>Fuck off back to Reddit.</br></br>  <br>And the personal desire of Karma is stupid. I know that being killed by the class was the last wish of the sensei, but come on, it would be like to kill his own father. Any child (yes, he is a child, not a pro) would be emotionally confused but he acts like it was a simple thing, "I want to kill because it's the right thing to do". That's it. Fuck you, Matsui! Go learn how to build dramas in a better way.</br>  <br> it would be like to kill his own father <br>Shouldn't you be in jail, Takaoka?</br></br>  <br>And the status quo appears again.<br><br> Save team wins but Nagisa suggests they compromise so they will spend 1 month focusing on saving, and if there are no leads or results then all their effort will go strictly to assassination.  <br>Shiro will show up before that, anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm reading to watch chuunis become functioning members of society.</br></br>  <br>Learn that it is better to save something than to destroy it is to be a better member of society.</br>  <br><br>Once they leave middleschool, he may as well be dead to them.

So, by choosing to save rather than kill Korosensei, probably, Koro, instead of destroying the earth, will sacrifice himself to save it.</br></br>  <br>Did they finally fug?</br>  <br> expecting that edgy faggot to win </br>  <br>so... nothing has changed. all that edginess for nothing. if they had accepted the request of nagisa from the beginning it would not have made any difference.</br>  <br>Change wasn't the point of this fight. It was for Nagisa and Karma development. If they had agreed with Nagisa from the start then the two of them would have never resolved their issue.</br>  <br>an issue that was planted now with the flashback, because, before that, they did not seem like rivals, enemies or anything like that. karma had some envy, but it was so poorly crafted that doesn't work as motivation for a war.</br>  <br>I second this.</br>  Use spoiler tags jesus fucking christ hope you get hit by a truck fucking cunt  <br>Bitch and Koro are confirmed murderers, though. The former was even introduced riding a corpse.</br>  Listening to the OST and fondly remembering that this was the shit while was airing, yet somehow weeks after the season ended, theres been no finale. <br><br>How is this allowed?
