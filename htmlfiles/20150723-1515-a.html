[ I got to say this part was pretty creepy. Loved it.  <br> Idom@ster </br>  new day, a new cat card    So nobody likes Dekoration?  Pretty kitty titty  Too bad P-chan wasnt Mayu's target, I wanted to see her have more animated scenes  <br>People do. The anons in the previous thread were just being cunts as usual.</br>  <br>It is however true that they failed completely getting any popularity.</br>  Momoka, Arisu, Nina group in the anime when?    <br> cow 79 <br>How many of her pictures do you have anon?</br></br>  Are you l@dy cake bros?<br><br>Will TakeP X Kaede canon?</br></br>    <br>Maybe he has other pictures of cows. How do you know he doesn't just really like cows?</br>  <br>A lot of people probably do, it's just Dekoration wouldn't be their favorite</br>  <br>You wouldn't a cat.</br>  <br>They are my favorite.<br><br><br>It's be a miracle even for one of them to be featured.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't mean it in a "no one has them as their favorite" kind of way, but there really shouldn't be a unit no one likes.</br>  You will never make KWSM regreat last night. <br><br>Why even produce?</br></br>  <br>Waiting for Chibiki.</br>  <br>I don't like Rosenburg Angel, Ranko should be with Love Laika</br>  <br>Because I drive to carry on thanks to the healing of an idol's smile.</br>  Kaede best l@dy  Mayu needs more love.  <br>Can't wait what is the content of that scene?</br>  I know Mayu is all about the love, but does she put out?  <br> animeonlyfag <br> watch first two episodes <br> favorite girl is   p-san <br><br>Is this normal?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I haven't watched this but that screenshot makes my dick react. It's like I've read so many doujin with this kind of face and framing that now I'm programmed to feel hot and bothered from it. The choker doesn't help, either. <br><br>Now I need to fap, probably to a Mayu doujin. Hopefully vanilla yandere.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably, he's the only likeable character shown in the first 2 episodes as the other Project Girls are given like one 30 second line the entire episode.</br>  <br>very normal<br>he's the most popular<br> under 2 Kiritos and 2 Shirous </br></br></br>  <br>Did someone say Kaede? Can't wait :3</br>  <br>Its Kaede time?</br>  <br>   under 2 Kiritos and 2 Shirous <br><br>This triggers me more than anything.</br></br></br>  <br>Uzuki was pretty likeable.</br>    <br>Probably should have rephrased to "interesting", Uzuki is objectively among the most likeable in the main cast but she's really damn plain, but it's her schtick so I forgave her fluffy little head.</br>  Soon comrades.  <br>Not soon enough.</br>  <br><br>Can someone spoil me with Mayu's background story?  Are all the BDs out? </br></br>  <br>Broducer being a favourite is common.</br>  <br><br>Shes crazy.</br></br>  <br>I'm fed up with her Ganbarimasu</br>  <br>From doujins alone you can tell that. But I want to know what her tragic story is since apparently every single girl (and trap) in idolm@aster has had some serious shit happen to them.</br>  <br>This show ruined what it could have had.</br>  <br>You'll never live Ganbarimasu as much as she did.<br><br>That said, could've been great if we got cynical Uzuki at least.</br></br></br>  <br> cynical Uzuki <br>Don't talk about nonexistent things.</br></br>  <br>Not really. At most, The most tragic girl in im@s is Chihaya for her front and backstory. <br><br>Most of CG girls are pretty normal girls and it's the fans who have to make things up.<br><br>Mayu's backstory is just that one day she saw Psan during her modeling gig and fell in love. That's pretty much it.<br><br>If you want back stories and drama galore, SideM is chock full of them though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How old is Natsuki?  <br><br>So fluffy. Uzupaca the cutest.</br></br>  <br>Too old for Riina, nya</br>  <br>Chieri has quite a bit of stuff herself.<br><br>While not necessarily deadbeat, her parents are rarely there for her. More often than not, her parents are busy and are never at home.<br><br>Her fascination with Clovers? Its not an obsession with luck but rather, its because she had a very fond memory of her parents involving Clovers when she was a kid. Thus, Clovers help her feel at ease.<br><br>Because of this upbringing, Chieri easily gets lonely and has some serious abandonment anxiety issues.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like ganbarimasu Uzuki enough already but even just a few scenes of cynical Uzuki would have made a great gap.</br>      <br>I'll be there for you, Chieri.</br>  <br>cuck<br>u<br>c<br>k</br></br></br></br>    <br> not a single 17 years old idol </br>  <br>I want Natsuki to kabedon me.</br>  <br>Holy shit you're blind.</br>  <br>Nana please go</br>  <br>But you are blind indeed.</br>  <br>Rin is scary<br><br>But even so, I want to see more of it.</br></br></br>  The best idol.    <br>Best CG, even if she isn't one</br>  <br>I want to brutalize Natsuki.</br>  <br><br>I'm partial to Happy Happy as well.</br></br>  <br><br>She will always be by P's side</br></br>  <br>I already</br>  <br><br>That is not rock.</br></br>  We have the Stepmother<br><br>And the attic<br><br>Then what is the BIg Ball?<br><br>And who is the fairy Godmother</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's just too cute.</br>  <br><br>Yes she is.</br></br>  <br><br><br>it breaks my heart, but I want to see Kirari cry.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't be mean.</br></br>  <br> How I interpreted this image. <br> She suffers of giantism. <br> She need to take medicines to maintain her heart alive. <br> But she is dieing. <br><br>Am I right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>More like she's depressed because she feels like she can never get the P's love.</br></br>  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/675915/f00340<wbr>f582/<br>She just kept getting ignored by the P and has always felt unloved. I guess it she was trying a sleeping pill induced suicide.</br></wbr></br>  <br>All hail the Paka.<br><br>Chieri is pretty aight too.</br></br></br>  <br>10/10 would give her the  brush </br>  <br><br>Who wouldn't?</br></br>    <br>I came here to look at cute idols, not feel. <br><br> ;_; </br></br></br>    <br>Kaede is love Kaede is life</br>  <br><br>ONORE KANZAKI RANKO.</br></br>  <br> Ranko is 14 <br>What</br></br>  <br>Literal chuuni.<br><br>But in all honesty, I think I was surprised she was 14 when I first found that out, too.</br></br></br>  belated but happy birthday to this wonderful Sugar Cake  <br>Dumping a little something then.</br>    <br>I like you, Kirari  ;_; </br>        <br>End.</br>  <br><br>Why she don't do an liposuction?</br></br>  Dat feel when still waiting for UTW to finish up S1. I heard horriblesubs was shit for this, but I'd like to finish it within the next decade.  <br>she would be fine if she left beer.</br>  <br><br>She looks 18+ by Im@s or anime standards, so I can understand the confusion</br></br>  <br> Trying to separate a Cake from her beer. <br><br>What kind of sick fuck are you?</br></br></br>  <br>Alright, I guess I can see how c@kes are that much more popular than l@lis in Im@s.</br>  WHEN THE FUCK IS TAKUMI  <br>What are you smoking.

I mean I know they are popular, but isn't BNHA more popular than Bleach right now in Japan. I mean why doesn't someone scan the whole magazine so we get everything at once. There is probably a good explanation but I don't know what it is. Naruto gaiden scans were coming out like 3 days before we wouldn't even get a BNHA spoiler. And the gaiden would be translated like five days before we got a translation for this series.</br>  <br> 3 days before we wouldn't even get a BNHA spoiler. And the gaiden would be translated like five days before we got a translation for this series. <br>Just lies.<br>We pretty much always got scans within 24 hours and china bro gives us a translation within that time frame too.<br>FA usually had their thing out within 48 hours, sometimes they went a little over but the longest i noticed was 3 days</br></br></br></br>  <br>back to reddit</br>  <br> but isn't BNHA more popular than Bleach right now in Japan <br>No. Just no.<br>BnHA is just well accepted, it isn't that much popular. You can't use ToCs alone to determine which series are popular.</br></br></br>    Awaiting scans.  which meido is best meido  Kohaku. Very evil. Very interesting.  Kohaku  Kohaku  Hisui    Tsukihime Thread?<br><br>Remake soon, it's been 7 years since it was announced.<br><br>Nasu will deliver.</br></br></br></br>  Fused meidos is best meidos  <br>I like both, but Kohaku is best</br>  The new dragon ball reminded me that I feel really bad for Videl.<br>She likes Gohan because he was the cool fighter who defeated Cell, but Gohan is actually a massive faggot who hates to fight.<br>If only she had been born 2 decades before, Goku could have ended with her instead of that insufferable bitch called Chi-Chi.</br></br>   implying Goku didnt cuck Gohan   She wasn't forced to marry him so why would you pity her? It was her decision and she seems satisfied with her choice.  <br> She wasn't forced to marry him <br>How do you know that?<br>She got pregnant of course she was forced.</br></br></br>  they are both shit now  <br>But Goku is an awful person and a worse husband.</br>  That's definitely not why she liked Gohan, though.   Talking shit about Chi Chi <br>bitch please</br>  <br>What are you talking about? She liked him because he had a pure heart and did his best to help those around him.<br><br>If all she wanted was some muscleman who goes around fighting people then she would have hooked up with one of them ages ago. Don't forget that her father runs a ring a the allegedly best human martial artists on earth.</br></br></br>  <br>Implying videl isn't just as bad now</br>  <br>Loli Chi-Chi is the best. Adult Chi-Chi is kind of a cunt, though.</br>  <br>She's fat.</br>  <br> Making your little girl to go around town dressed like that <br>Literally asking for it.</br></br>  <br>This. <br>OP is clearly an idiot, probably projecting his own feelings onto a cartoon character.</br></br>  <br>Gohan did like to fight though. She even caught him fighting criminals.<br>Gohan doesn't like fighting for his life, but he actually seemed kind of excited for the World Martial Arts tournament. He even looked forward to the training.<br>Gohan just wants to focus on his studies so he's cut down on the training, because any worthwhile training is something that takes All day apparently   Gohan had to take off school to train for the World Tournament  </br></br></br>  <br><br> This Chichi is absurd, the Old Chichi is absurd, the better Chichi is the one during the last tournament against Piccolo, and if she wanted more links with her husband, should should continue to fight instead to appear and old woman even if is more young than Bulma.</br></br>  <br>arent loli's meant to be chubby ?</br>  <br>I don't really think its right to say that he was genuinely excited about the tournament, he wasn't really excited about the tournament itself as much as just seeing his friends there.</br>  What if Gogeta SSJ4 is actually Super Saiyan God 4 Gogeta?<br><br> SSj4 / Basic Saiyan = Black Hair <br> Super Saiyan God = Red Hair <br> Super Saiyan God 4 =    Red Hair  </br></br></br></br>  <br>*And by Super Saiyan God 4 i mean Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan 4</br>  <br>Why did his hair turn red, anyway?</br>  <br>Thats what this theory is based on, Anon. We've got no answer.<br><br>This one would be an answer.</br></br></br>  <br>I really hate what Toriyama did to her character. I really would have liked to see her keep up with her fighting/training in her Dojo. I don't care about strength specifically but I really liked her tomboyish attitude. Now she's just a bland, no personality generic housewife and I really don't like it.<br><br>It's similar to how I feel about 18 being shafted in the Revival of F movie with such a sad excuse for why she didn't get to fight even though she's way stronger than Krillin.<br><br>Toriyama is just shit with female characters in general, they either just get shafted and sidelined or forgotten entirely (Sorry Launch).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Now she's just a bland, no personality generic housewife and I really don't like it. <br><br>You really don't know women. Every time you hear women being professional or careerists and such? That is all an act. Because all women want to be wives. Being wives is THE retirement package for a twat.<br><br>After she's a wife she has gained a sucker/slave to provide for her so the mask comes off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You sound like you have issues dude.<br><br>Maybe you should see a therapist, seriously, talk to a professional about your girl issues.</br></br></br>  <br>But she's the one treating nerd Gohan like her personal fucktoy.</br>  What if Videl and Gohan were having sex and when he came he accidentally released a kamehameha wave from his dick?  When you think about it, Gohan was the polar opposite of Videl's father. Her father was arrogant and prideful, he took credits for the achievements of other and was an all-around attention whore. On the other hand Gohan saved the world but didn't bring any attention to it. He fought crime but preferred to do it anonymously while living as an average guy. Considering that Videl hated her father it's no surprise that Gohan had qualities that interested her.  <br> After she's a wife she has gained a sucker/slave to provide for her so the mask comes off <br>Videl is the breadwinner though. Gohan is living of Videl's fortune</br></br>  <br>That doesn't even make sense.</br>  Why do people like the Artificial Human arc so much?  Goku should have ended up with Bulma  <br>Goku fired a kamehameha wave from his feet.<br>I don't see why it doesn't make sense that Gohan could make one with his dick.</br></br>  <br>Because shit like Terminator 2 was popular then.</br>  <br>Toriyama's editor was the president of the Goku/Bulma fanclub and even support Toriyama when he decided to let Goku grow up but Toriyama trolled him</br>  <br>So, I have that guy to blame for taking my fun adventure and turning it into power levels?</br>  <br>Torishima? He was opposed to the idea of Goku growing up, and then Toriyama warned him that he wouldn't continue the story if Goku couldn't become an adult.</br>  <br>I read it was Shueisha's big guys the ones against Goku growing up but Toriyama's editor supported the idea for having a Bulma end. Apparently, he liked romance and he always pushed it on shounen titles</br>  <br> as much as just seeing his friends there. <br><br>I just realized that most of Gohans friends are just Goku's friends.<br><br>Poor guy only had Dende (and this little dude was also constantly busy being Kamisama) until he went to highschool and met Videl and the other two whattheirfaces, Pencil and Ereaser?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Projecting thia much <br><br>Anon, I think you have a problem.<br><br>Also, It's Videl the one who's providing Gohan.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Toriyama is just shit with female characters in general, they either just get shafted and sidelined or forgotten entirely (Sorry Launch). <br><br><br>No one can be as worse as Masashi "Hack" Kishimoto</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, god form is weak to be comparable to ssj 4.</br>  <br>If we are talking animal instinct level kinda shit then you've got a point anon.<br>Chi Chi as an example. Women instinctively try to get the best genes for their children and try to insure that they survive to make grand children.<br>She married and had kids with the most powerful man in the world who took out Frezia and Buu. Given how powerful Gohan is with how he handled Cell she has techially done her job from a nature standpoint<br>When it comes to Videl she's got Gohan who is probably one of the strongest people on the planet. Once she has kids with him he'll probably want to stick around due to how shit of a father Goku was to him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>SSJ4 got cut by falling glass in GT</br>  <br>Krilin and the rest of the gang are like Gohan's cool uncles while Piccolo is his non-shit dad.</br>  <br>That's not the point. You can't just accidentally Kamehameha.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Fkb<wbr>xNypK6ds</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Man I love this OP but 0:13 bothers me more than it should<br><br>GOKU of all people just had a heartwarming and memorable bonding moment with his son, and Chichi bitches him out for it.

Still, when she does his voice something about it is just off, was it always like that?</br>  <br> She likes Gohan because he was the cool fighter who defeated Cell <br>Not really, she likes him for other reasons.<br><br> but Gohan is actually a massive faggot who hates to fight. <br>yeah, how come they write him consistently?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> generic Background civilians of Satan City </br>  <br><br>Saiyan hairstyles always look kind of weird with regular civilian clothes</br></br>  <br>When you have sex your muscles and neurons spams in uncontrollable ways.

Or will it just be more of Goku/Vegeta being the only ones worth a damn<br><br>I want Gohan, Piccolo, Majin Buu, Tenshinhan, and maybe even Android 18 to have fights of their own. It may be too late for Yamcha and Krilliin but the others should be able to at least remain relevant with training/plot device power boosts.</br></br>  <br> Beerus beats everyone in BoG with a finger <br> Nobody does anything in RoF <br>What the fuck do you think? Only Goku and Vegeta will go to universe 6. How any of you expect humans to get a power up to go to SSJ tier when even SSJ is obsolete now.</br></br></br>  <br><br>the only reason he didnt want to do the tournament was because chi chi told him he couldnt use his powers at school so he didnt want to be found out. during the baseball game he said that he didnt understand why he had to hide his powers. in reality he probably wanted to join the tournament if he could do it without anyone noticing him.</br></br>  <br>well, there have been contrived powerups in Dragon Ball before. The only thing that's stopping them from writing a new plot device that boosts the rest of the fighters up is Toriyama.<br><br>Remember that brief moment in time when Piccolo was the strongest Z-fighter? I miss that. The rest of the Z-fighters don't need to be the one to defeat the Big bad but they at least need to feel like they're not useless, and at this point everyone except Goku and Vegeta sure as hell feels that way.</br></br></br>  <br><br>There should be no problem for Buu to replace the others as battle support, Piccolo could fuse with another nigger to become supporting cast, 18 is good housewife so she will not come to fight. Gohan still could help but he is more than clear he left that life behind, we still have Goten and Trunks tho.<br><br>Humans are doomed, Krillin still come along, he can carry the senzu beans and maybe if someone come up with a better Kaioken or another technique like that for Tenshinhan he could be useful. And those are all the names worthy of mentioning, unless shit is dragged enougth for Uub to appear.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well that's just because he got Bulma's hair.

He also designed that story's version of the Tuffles and Freeza's ancestor.<br><br>The Dragonball 30th anniversary site's timeline considers Bardock being thrown to the past manga canon.</br></br></br>  <br>I will fight you.<br><br>Broly is the best movie villain, and could have easily been best villain overall if they bothered giving him any character.</br></br></br>  <br> It wasn't made by Tori neither did he had any say in it. <br>Are you really going to take seriously the statement of a man who barely remember what his characters are supposed to work?<br>The SSJG was bullshit, but okay I can take it.

For some reason the threads have always been dead before they reach 200 posts since the arc began  <br>Wow, you might be right. I think I still expected comedy for this arc for some weird reason. I will have to watch this again some time soon.</br>  <br>Kondo Rescue arc started out well, but it's meh overall and the way Gorilla handled Sasaki's flashback is terrible,  Nobume should be the one who killed his wife and child <br><br>Anyway, spoiler soon and i don't think there will be any comedy since we have yet to see a proper conclusion</br></br></br>  <br>The reason why I found this arc great and not weak compared to the other arcs is because how strong and meaningful the theme was. The fact that Executioners cut the criminals head off clean without it falling off to touch the floor was to have them keep their dignity till death. As a way to keep them clean from their sins. Which is why it was said multiple times that the only way to turn a demon back to a human is a human itself. And that's the duty of a Executioner.<br><br>That's why this arc was in no way weak compared to the other arcs unless you pretty much ignore the whole theme.</br></br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>Well, I don't really like it even back when I was reading the manga.<br>Still waiting for the Katsura and Shogun arc.</br></br>  Killed in production.<br>We can all relax.<br><br>http://screenrant.com/scarlett-joha<wbr>nsson-ghost-in-shell-financing-atte<wbr>mpts-falter/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> we </br>  <br>oh fuck off</br>  Dance thread?

Even if they were to pull a "Edge of Tomorrow" and give all the cast western names and set it in futuristic LA, she would still be a bad choice for The Major.</br></br>  <br>Good. Scarlett Johansson is a retarded bitch who wouldn't even watch the anime, and wouldn't get it if she did.

America can go back to ruining their own cyberpunk 80s properties now.</br>  <br>god dammit I've been had!</br>    <br>Because Sigourney Weaver is a fuckin legend.<br><br>That's like trying to find a replacement for Clint Eastwood.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably not very much when the project's not going ahead.</br>  <br>It'd be far easier to make a live action Psycho-Pass, since Akane is canonically a 5 at best.</br>  <br>She was really good in Her and Under the skin, I don't know why anons hate her so much.</br>  This means Anime and Manga won't end up like Comics have now and thankfully Video Games will become the new Capeshit.  <br>Let me help you with that.<br><br>Assuming we're going with GITS with western setting and western versions of the characters this is the only right choice.</br></br></br>  <br>Anime and manga will never fall to the normies.</br>  <br>She was an unknown before Alien came out. I know ScarJo would be bad as Major. I can dream can't I?<br><br>ScarJo would make an amazing cosplay as Major. The facial symmetry is similar. It should stop there.  unless she did a porn as Major? *drools </br></br></br>  <br>I loved her in Under The Skin and i don't hate her at all, but she is a bad choice for The Major.</br>  Michael Cera as Shinji when?  <br>Remember Aeon Flux?<br><br>Yeah, no thanks.</br></br></br>  <br>Ben Garrison in Jin Roh when?</br>    <br>Aeon Flux and Lucy are what I'm picturing a GITS turning into. That is my nightmare.</br>  <br>I would have had there been a successful adaption. Fortunately Hollywood is fucking stupid and don't go for adaptions that make the most sense. (Black Lagoon, Hellsing Cowboy Bebop, Gunsmith CATS, hell even Panty and Stocking)<br><br>Instead trying to adapt DragonBall , GITS , EVA and Akira. If any adaption would have set in motion an anime adaption boom in Hollywood, it would have been Battle Angel. Since nearly everything James Cameron is involved with usually passes a billion easily. He will be making Avatar movies for the next decade or so, so that shit is dead.</br></br></br>  <br><br>They are trying to take it but since Japanese don't give into feminist so easily Anime, Manga and Literature are the safest hobbies from them and normies.</br></br>  <br>To be fair, the source material for those movies was were retarded, making ScarJo seem even more retarded.</br>  <br> Aeon Flux <br><br>Do i REALLY need to go into why that didn't work as a movie? It was doomed from the start and she was miscast. Also Aeon=/= The fucking Major.</br></br></br>  <br>More like Shia Lebouf.</br>  <br>Again Scarjo would make a better Duenan Knute, she's not imposing enough to be The Major.</br>  <br>Shia Lebouf got buff.<br><br>Akira mmmight work on some levels if the guy writing the Netflix Daredevil is writing the screenplay for Akira. The themes and soul of it would be lost of course.</br></br></br>  Why don't western adaptations try to at least amke the characters look somewhat like realistic versions of the animu characters?<br><br>Is it s much to ask for a hair cut/dye</br></br>  <br>The idea of live-action Cowboy Bebop has been around for a while. They even got Keanu Reeves to play Spike. It may happen one day.<br><br>http://www.kpopstarz.com/articles/1<wbr>78148/20150225/cowboy-bebop-live-ac<wbr>tion-movie-2015.htm</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Naw, if he gets asked to get into the EVA he'd just do it</br>  <br>Lucy was a total disaster, but ScarJo has other movies to prove she can act and actually give good performances. But as the other anon said, she is not really Motoko; still, is hard to translate such "jap" personality into a western character without something gets lost in translation.</br>  <br> The themes and soul of it would be lost of course. <br>Exactly. I would much rather see the Novel adapted in a series of animated films rather than some western live action shit that will miss the point completely.<br><br>But something like Black Lagoon is easy as fuck to adapt. Hell Mathew Vaughn would be the perfect director for it.</br></br></br></br>  The reason ScarJoJo always rubbed me the wrong way here is because she does action for the paychecks.<br><br>If you want a female lead, get somebody who actually makes an effort to appear like she could kick somebody's ass.<br><br>The worst example of shitcasting, was getting Emilia Clarke's fat ass to play Sarah Connor. Holy Shit. Did they actually see Linda Hamilton in T2, for fuck's sake?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fun Fact: The woman in your pic was the original pic for Black Widow before Scarjo.</br>    <br>I wonder if a Bebop movie would get compared to Guardians of the Galaxy. You got your rag tag space crew doing space things and they will probably make another guardians movie anyway.</br>  <br>Action stars can't be too pretty. They probably have about the same muscle mass though.</br>  <br>Why would you want to make some effort when Black Widow was a doomed character in a shitcape movie? Writers can't into female characters, and male characters are only "badass guys" or "evil guys", there is no chance to show any acting method in those flicks.</br>  <br>What if Keanu's aging suddenly  spikes ?</br>  <br> something gets lost in translation <br>funny guy huh</br></br>  <br>By casuals? Most likely would be compared to Firefly, even though the latter took quite a bit from the former. Just like people will no doubt be comparing GITS to The Matrix</br>  It's directed by the guy who did Snow White and the Huntsman it was always going to be fucking shambles  <br>the bait</br>  <br>Urobuchi is as bad as Ubukata though</br>  So it's really over with then? Good, I can finally sleep tonight.  Ghost in the Shell is saved.  <br>Linda Hamilton was fucking badass and cool in that movie. You realize a woman doesn't need to be pretty on a movie when she can delivers a good performance with muscles and a strong face. But no, now a "strong woman" needs to use high heels because "reasons".</br>  <br>oh you<br><br>A mini-series might do the Bebop material more justice. The slower pacing would be good. Especially if they are trying to retell the main story.</br></br></br>  How many times has this been cancelled and recancelled? Either way the OP link is fake.  <br>As do Dwayne Johnson and Paul Blart.</br>  Did ANYONE actually click the link?  <br><br>I see my wording was ambiguous. I meant action starts SHOULDNT be too pretty.</br></br>  <br>yes and it's fake</br>  <br>But Firefly already ripped off Outlaw Star.</br>  <br>no because when people (fucking retards) see something on 4chains, they instantly want to give their worthless 2 cents on the matter</br>  <br>this doesnt mean that whatever we do eventually end up with will be any better</br>  <br>That's just stupid and arbitrary.</br>  <br>she looks a little more muscular here</br>  <br>That's just the most practical way to store your loli. Where do you keep yours?</br>  <br>I doubt anyone remembers firefly/serenity , and wouldn't GitS get compared to blade runner as well. You know, why don't they just remake blade runner? Is it because it doesn't have a feMC?</br>  <br> he doesn't use the add-on </br>  <br> loli </br>  <br>They're doing a sequel actually.</br>  <br>I always trust everyone on 4chan to be telling the truth.</br>  <br>Trust No One</br>  <br> why don't they just remake blade runner <br>They're making a sequel.</br></br>  Thank you, Allah.  <br> sorry, the page you are looking for cannot be found or has been deleted </br>  <br>what could it mean, anon?</br>  <br> canonically a 5 at best. </br>    <br>Before the Terminator franchise came along, Linda Hamilton was just another pretty faced young actress. No one expected her to buff up for her role in T2, but god damn is the movie so much better for her dedicating herself to looking like a mother who was preparing for the apocalypse.<br>I wish actresses these days had that sort of dedication. Look at you, Gol Gadot.</br></br>  <br>She's not sexy at all.<br>Otherwise Yayoi would have seduced her by now.</br></br>  <br> Fake <br>Fuck you too</br></br>    So are the rumors true you think? <br><br>Did Masamune Shirow die during the Japan Earthquakes, and his staff is using his name to sell art still? <br><br>No one has talked to the man since the earthquakes, but his studio keeps pumping things out...</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think Yayoi knows how to approach strong girls.</br>  <br>Urobuchi sells more than Ubukata and gets better reviews than Ubukata, that's all that matters</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xem<wbr>Lz_fR1Ac</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Good</br></br></br>  <br>No.<br>He died inside from losing his life's work with no backups whatsoever.

It has a darker tone than DM but it has all the crazy ancient civilization motif. Just so you know, card games has been combined with motor sports and alot of people find it awesome.</br>  <br>Just started 5Ds a few days ago myself, on episode 10 and I'm really enjoying it</br>  <br>Arc-V does not capture the spirit of 5Ds with the riding duels. No VROOOOOOOOOOOM inbetween plays or anything like that.<br><br>I even prefer Arc-V to 5Ds but they need to get the fuck out of Synchro Land and go back to their ninja shit</br></br></br>  <br>5Ds then Arc-V</br>  <br>What?</br>  Where do I watch/download GX with good quality?  <br>You forgot, Arc-V doesn't have based MC<br> EVERYBOODY LISTEEN </br></br>  <br>but the VROOOOOOM is shit. that's not how bikes sound like</br>  I pray everyday to Z-One in hopes Jacks gets crushed and carded for being a traitor.  <br>What asspull power does tomato have? I only watched the first episode please   spoil me </br>  <br>EGAO</br>  <br>Search GX subber on the archive.<br><br>If you have seen the first episode you already know that.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't tell him to watch Arc-V as they pretty much fucked up riding duels. If they wanted to bring back fucking card games on motorcycles, they shouldn't have done away with speed counters, speed spells, and fucking Speed World upgrade. Seriously, we could have done without Synchro being basically fucking Neo Domino. And we could have done without Jack and Crow being there.<br><br><br>Search the archive.

Its the same as when everyone kept thinking she'd learn XYZ</br>  <br>They would obviously take at least a minute to show Sawatari's face contorting in terror at the realization he is about to lose to a child.</br>  <br>I fear Yuzu won't go beyond Fusion and Pendulum at this rate. If they were going to have her Synchro, this arc would've been perfect set up to show her practicing it with Yugo before the Friendship Cup.</br>  Let'sall ENJOY<br><br>KOI KOI KOI KOI <br>KOI KOI KOI KOI</br></br></br>  <br>People have been thinking Yuzu is "just about" to learn syncro for ages*</br>  I've been watching Zexal because it's the only YGO series that I haven't seen and holy fucking shit is it awful. Yuma does something good but resets to complete idiot by the next episode. Only 2 duels have got me hype so far because the action is lacking.  Isn't Sawatari vsing Yuzu in the Friendship Cup??  <br>I guess we'll have to wait for her next duel to see:^)</br>  how do you feel about dub names?<br>rate them:<br>gongenzaka&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;gong  I like it <br>yuzu hiragi&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;zuzu boyle  retarded <br>kurosaki shun&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;shay  could be better, could be worse <br>sawatari shingo&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Silvio I like it <br>LDS&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;LID(leo institute of dueling) feels kinda pointless, but both names are good <br>akaba reiji&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Declan  I like it. gives a mature name that relates to english speakers. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't confirmed</br>  <br>Just a rumor.</br>  <br>lying and editing neo new sawatari's win/lose ratio is not ok anon. don't do that.</br>  <br>If she does learn it, it won't be before Yuya.<br><br>Yuya will probably use Synchro on his R1 opponent.</br></br></br>  <br>Too bad Reira is getting mindraped by some jean lackey<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hwN<wbr>dAXkc8Kg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>yuma's a fucking idiot that can't duel for the first couple arcs. by the finals of the heartland cup he actually learns how to play, and ZEXAL II is a lot better.<br><br><br>I think he'll use it in his rematch vs jack, and he'll use the tuner jack gave the kid. as for yuzu, I wouldn't be surprised if she picks up synchro summoning before the finals.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He'll use pendulum synchro against Jack to go even further beyond so he needs to learn synchro sooner</br>  <br> S-She is going to learn Xyz from Shun <br> Tfw they never interacted again after episode 21 </br></br>   Yuzu <br> Dueling ever <br>lmao she's going to job first round then become yuya.wav for the rest of the series</br></br>  <br>I can see him doing some form of Synchro.v2 in his rematch vs jack. <br>And for that to happen he has to use normal Synchro before duelling Jack again. Like how Yuya used Dark Rebellion a lot before going full OERD.</br></br>  <br>he learned pendulum fusion in one duel, why not pendulum synchro?</br>  <br>God I hope not</br>  <br>You can't damage whats already broken. Reira will eye rape them in return. <br><br>Why did they give Ruka such a good theme. It's almost criminal.</br></br></br>  PENDUALUM<br>PENDUALUM<br>PENDUALUM<br>PENDUALUM</br></br></br>  <br>I dunno, she's been shown to be actually competent at dueling, I doubt they'd shaft her like that.</br>  <br> I wouldn't be surprised if she picks up synchro summoning before the finals <br>No way would they detract from the uniqueness of Yuya mastering syncro in addition to fusion by having Yuzu do it first. Yuzu was getting fusion lessons from Sora, and Yuya still did it first. But I dont think they'll have another of of the Lancers (who isnt a villian) besides Yuya and Reiji do multiple summoning methods<br><br><br>People overrated how many shits Shun gives about non Ruri Ruris</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No way would they detract from the uniqueness of Yuya mastering syncro in addition to fusion by having Yuzu do it first </br>  Yuya is going to  PENDULUM ACCEL SYNCHRO  during his duel against Jack  <br>I have a brother called Declan, he fucking sucks at Yugioh, we laugh about this all the time.</br>  <br> Dueling Jack again <br>It would be pointless and a waste of time.</br></br>  <br>Alright, during the Fusion invasion then</br>  <br>He got fucked by Jack the first time, he needs to beat him</br>  <br> He got fucked by Jack the first time, he needs to beat him <br><br>Not that anon you responded to but no, Yuya doesn't "need" to beat Jack. By that logic, Yuma needed to beat Kaito. If anything, Jack will get BTFO and carded by Yuri to hype Yuri up as being ridiculously good, only for Yuya to beat Yuri when the Lancers go to Academia. So by beating the person who carded Jack, it is kinda like defeating Jack himself. Since it would show that Yuya has surpassed Jack.<br><br>Just like how Yuya indirectly proved he was stronger than Shun by basically defeating Sora in their rematch. Then again, YGO is cliche as fuck when it comes to the protagonist losing only to win in a rematch.<br><br>Yugi's real losses were Pegasus, Kaiba (Duelist Kingdom), and Rafael in that order. Yugi beat all of them in the rematch. Judai beat Ryo and Edo in their rematches (well tied with Ryo, but Judai didn't lose), and never got to duel Kaibaman because he was filler so it didn't matter. Yusei lost to Jack (off-screen) and Kiryu but beat both of them in the rematch. Yuma beat everyone in a rematch who he lost to, except Kaito (although their last duel was the only one Yuma actually lost, even if he would have lost the first duel too).<br><br>If Yuya duels Jack again it would be stupid since the plot LITERALLY demands that Yuya win because the YGO protagonists tend to beat the person they lost to in a rematch. What point would there be if we already know Yuya would win because plot?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Gonna be curious, do you have a cosplay for your favourite monster? It could be anything, from your cardfu to an eldritch abomination, and don't say me that there can't be a cosplay for a dragon, unrelated to topic I saw a very tall man doing a perfect cosplay of Dukemon, so if that is possible then even a Stardust Dragon is too. Just don't use Dark Magician Girl, it's already too used.  <br> By that logic, Yuma needed to beat Kaito <br>Yuma never really strongly cared about showing he was better than Kaito (he never really did actually, Kaito never lost any match without bullshit involved). He just wanted to be friends with him. Yuya and Jack is different, Jack destroyed the entertainment duel Yuya base himself around, he wants to prove it isnt just self satisfaction directly to Jack.<br><br> If Yuya duels Jack again it would be stupid since the plot LITERALLY demands that Yuya win because the YGO protagonists tend to beat the person they lost to in a rematch <br>Its not really cliche so much as basic storytelling. Have the protag lose the first fight for a stated reason, set up a rematch for the future, have the protag develop in the lead up to it in response to the reason, then have him overcome his foe at the climax<br><br> What point would there be if we already know Yuya would win because plot? <br>What point was there in Yuya fighting Jack the first time when we knew Yuya would lose because plot?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I hope Crow and Shinji don't join the lancers. Sure, the goal is to take allies from Synchro, but those two are boring and shitty characters.  <br>Who would join the lancers? certainly not KINGU</br>  <br>fugg meant for this </br>  <br>Unless Carly has something to do about it with the Lancers or Academia. I HOPU </br>  <br>Well it's good if you have a high level dragon... And Sam has no other cards so</br>  <br>How about no one? It would be funny to see Reiji's keikaku fail.</br>  <br>I'm guessing Yuya's new Synchro Dragon would follow the levels and naming scheme of Beast-Eyes and Rune-Eyes</br>  <br>Do you want me to give you some DMG cosplay or you prefer other ones?

I don't want to buy Blackwings..</br></br>  <br>It's amazing what make-up, the right lighting, and photoshop can do.</br>  <br> He doesn't want to buy Blackwings </br>  <br><br>Both Arc-V and 5Ds are good points to start. If you only want to watch one series go Arc-V because you'll be able to speculate with us. If you feel like you want to get full back into it start with 5Ds. Arc-V has a lot of callbacks to 5Ds</br></br>  <br><br> Arc-V doesn't have MC <br> implying <br> M  elissa  C laire </br></br></br></br>  <br> Rei Shingetsu <br><br>It works, but other Rei would have been better, yeah.</br></br></br>  <br>She isn't as based as 5D's MC</br>  <br><br>I'm a complete fucking retard.

It's still random monsters and Resonators to make Red Demons Dragon  <br>He runs a lot of fiends</br>  <br><br>Lol <br>Bye</br></br></br>  <br><br>It would be absolutely retarded if Crow lost to Gon</br></br>  Is Fate as bad as /a/ makes it out to be?  Maybe.  <br>Fate is not even bad, it's just inferior.</br>  <br>Read the VN and find out.</br>  Everything is 10 times worse than /a/ makes it out to be.  <br> Read a 50+ hour VN <br><br>I could get through 6-7 anime instead. Is it really worth the investment?</br></br></br>  No, /a/ actually likes Fate, which means it's much worse than /a/ makes it out to be.  <br>The VN is great. <br>Popular series just get shit on here<br>Capcha was Arthur</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah if you care.</br>  ---I'll show you.<br>This is what it means to kill something.<br> Welcome to this wonderful killing chamber. </br></br>  <br>No, UBW is pretty decent for a shounen anime and the VN is alright (by VN standards) especially considering when it came out.</br>  <br>shiki would wreck archer even in ubw</br>  <br>Not it isn't, you can watch 6-7 hours of anime or get 42-43 hours more of terribly written filler</br>  /a/ doesn't make it out to be bad. Otherwise there wouldn't be a million daily threads about it. <br><br>You're a faggot, OP.</br></br>  Why does /a/ bash Servant Saber yet glorify Tohsaka Rin?  <br>Seiba is the most popular Fate so we have to be contrarian and hate her.</br>    It's either the best thing since sliced bread according to fanboys or the worst thing since Hitler according to trolls.<br><br>For me it's just a fun little battle series. And mythological heroes is a legitimately cool idea.</br></br>  <br>*heroes from different periods in a battle royale</br>  <br> It's either the best thing since sliced bread according to trolls or the worst thing since Hitler according to trolls. <br>Fixed. I like it, it's good, but it has it's flaws.</br></br>  <br>Shiki is shit unless his blood kicks in, which I don't think would get triggered by le red man</br>  <br>servants are non human, so it would get triggered</br>  <br>UBW is trash</br>  <br> /a/ doesn't make it out to be bad <br><br/></br></br>  What happened to the "Saber cuck lol" meme that was running rampant last time I visited this place? Was it just some bored anon who eventually got bored of it as well?  <br>saber is literally a cuck though</br>  <br>Sakura gets cucked more than any other character in the VN. Even by her own Servant.</br>   is x as bad as 4chan makes it out to be? <br><br>The answer is almost always no, unless something truly wretched like Pupa, Dragonball Evolution, Metroid Other M, or   you're waifu </br></br>  Even worse.  <br>That's the same ratio of content in most anime.</br>  <br>LITTLE</br>  <br> forming opinions based on what others tell you <br>Read it; like it or don't while not being autistic about it; proceed to wonder why fanbase is autistic anyway; realize any sort of discussion about it on /a/ is terrible and never post in/make threads again<br><br><br> forming opinions based on an adaptation without having seen/read the source material </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Rin is the best girl.</br>  Average as average can be.<br>If you have literally nothing to do, read the VN.<br>Otherwise, just go watch better anime.<br>It wasn't worth the time investment, honestly.</br></br></br>  <br>it's not an opinion you cuck, it's factually true.</br>  <br>Rin is supreme.</br>  <br>She's scary</br>  <br>This anon speaks facts.</br>  <br><br>post more smokey rins</br></br>  <br>Encouraging shitposting is against the rules.</br>  <br>Rin owns two Shirous, every other heroine only has one Shirou. Rin is best confirmed.</br>  <br>They're both shit along with every other girl from the VN</br>  Everything I see posted on here about it, shitposting or otherwise, makes it out to be stupidly pretentious and deep in the way it's written and that just doesn't make me interested in it at all.  <br> One guy = /a/ <br>m8</br></br>  <br>Fabulous opinion, well too bad I guess this wasn't for you.</br>  <br>If it keeps people like you out, all the better.</br>  <br>Rin is an addict.</br>  <br><br>I'd say it's worth reading. You've probably been spoiled on most of the twists due to being on /a/, but it still can be fun. It's bloated as hell, but with good characters and an interesting setting.</br></br>  <br>Shit taste.<br><br>Rin's pretty ugly. Her design is a joke.</br></br></br>  <br>Rin is a sweetheart.</br>  <br>What makes you say that?</br>  <br><br><br>Twintails are generic ZR look with terrible colors are awful past 12 years old. Her only good look is in HF Epilogue.</br></br></br>  <br>Rin is always good.<br><br>In fact, Rin is great.</br></br></br>  <br>There's only one way to find out.</br>  <br>She looks retarded.</br>  <br>Fate females are shit, yes.</br>  It's worse.<br>But still not as bad as the VNs.</br>  <br> Disliking ZR <br>Your opinion is worthless.</br></br>  Europoor time is when this fanbase is complete shit.  Where's the Grand Order Nasu?  <br>  females are shit, yes. <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br>  It is a complicated thing. It is subjectively entertaining but objectively overrated.  <br>Ive watched the '06 anime and UBW. 06 and the second half of UBW were shit. First half of UBW is alright.<br><br>Worth watching for Tohsaka.</br></br></br>  <br>No, Shirou's character is a masterpiece. In fact, If Shirou's character wasn't in a battle series with chuuni magical elements in a niche Japanese medium he'd be marveled as a literary masterpiece, a modern Hamlet that defines modern protagonists. First he'd need to be moved into a story without magic, and instead his backstory was that he was a survivor of a terrorist bombing 10 years and was then saved by the terrorist who planned the whole event. Then you could replace all the magical backstory with political elements and set the story in the Middle East, replace the Holy Grail War with a regular war, etc. If you had a more "serious" story that people didn't judge on the fact it had porn scenes and was from Japan, people would be regarding Shirou as one of the most interesting protagonists of modern literature. This is a fact that none of us can escape from even if we insult Fate as a chuuni eroge.</br>  <br>/a/ makes Fate out to be bad? Last I checked the more shitposting a series gets, the better it usually is. That's how I usually go about taking recommendations from /a/ and I haven't been steered wrong since.</br>  <br>Rin is not dumb.</br>  <br>I've only read the VN so I can't really recommend the anime versions , but I really enjoyed it. Yeah It took like 4 days in game to complete the three routes and it's just like any other typical shonen, but that's just how it is.</br>  <br> Whore of Babylon figure among best King figures </br>  <br>If there was an accepted canon of anime that any fan was expected to be familiar with, Fate would be in there so you might as well watch/read it. At the very least for shitposting purposes.</br>  Does Shirou ever stop being so bland in UBW? I'm vaguely aware of his characterization being appreciated on /a/ but jesus fuck he does not have a drop of charisma so far.  <br>How far are you? He gets better towards the end of 2014UBW but in general his characterization and development was handled much better in the VN.</br>  <br>His character is supposed to be hollow for the most part, but through the series, as he fights for his ideal and gets closer to Rin, he does emote more.<br><br><br>Nasu actually said the anime got his characterization closer to how he originally wanted him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirou only really gets to God-tier MC status in HF. UBW is pretty much default Shirou.<br><br>The anime is also less focused on his characterization, which is a real shame, because everything outside Shirou's head is ultimately irrelevant.</br></br></br>   The main sailor senshi represent the 5 types of girls you'll date throughout your life: <br><br><br> Mercury is the meek nerdy girl you date in highschool. The two of you playing video games and engaging in deep conversation, but by the time of graduation you have yet to get into her pants, and probably never will since she's off to a good college and will cure cancer or something. <br><br> Mars is the bitch that you meet in freshman year. The two of you hook up while drunk and somehow decide to date. It's not bad, she gives the best sex ever but she's slowly becoming a fucking feminazi. You break up over dumb things only to get back together instantly. <br><br> Venus is the qt that you had to wait to get your shot at. She gives amazing oral, is funny, smart and flirty. But taking her out on dates is draining all of your money. You're a fucking beta and become her slave, only for her to cheat on you with numerous guys. <br><br> Moon is your perfect match. Feminine, spoony, supportive , maybe a bit childish but best of all, she's a complete bro. She's the type that fulfils all of your sexual fantasies. You can see yourself marrying this woman, except that some evil brainwashed you into cheating and costed you the best girl. <br><br> Jupiter is the girl you're introduced you by coworkers who pity your loneliness. She's strong and motherly but otherwise pretty average. You're late in life and maybe should settle down her, but it'll be an uneventful marriage. You think you can do better and leave her. <br><br> There's no more girls for you to date now. Your tinder prospects are shit and it's likely you'll die a creeper while jerking off to under aged anime chicks. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   5 types of girls you'll date <br>Still waiting on that first girl ;_;</br>  <br>Those muffled screams definitely sounded like a yes.</br>  <br>Congrats, you just invited a blog thread.</br>  I didn't think it was possible to make Jupiter sound so dull, but you did it OP.<br><br>She's still hot.
