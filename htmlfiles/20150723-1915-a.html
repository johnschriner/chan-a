That is, if they didn't fucking tone down and censor the rest of the 5% that actually has some sort of interesting premise. Hell, why not turn the MC and his soldiers into fucking high-schoolers while you're at it... If you moeify, censor and remove any adult &amp; mature themes, you might as well adapt another fucking Light/Visual novel aimed at beta faggots. There are thousands of those out there, go make animes out of those instead of showing us this butchered crap.<br><br>Remove the gore, violence any sort, nudity or any sort of mature themes, and the series suddenly looses any appeal it had from the start. What's Berserk, Gungrave or say Black Lagoon without it's graphic violence and devoid of any mature and explicit content whatsoever? Fucking boring and pointless! Might as well watch swordshit moe online instead, because the difference is suddenly minimal.</br></br></br></br>  <br> g-go away <br>Nice argument, retard. You're probably one of the people I described.</br></br>  <br> He is literally saying moeblob SoL is ruining the industry. <br><br> He's right </br></br></br>  <br>everyone saw this coming from a mile away<br><br>wheres that picture of the one guy going "we're forced to do this shit, we can't write what we want" and hes all hyper depressed and shit</br></br></br>  <br>I don't understand why it is so popular.

Not japanese. But I don't think there's a better board to ask anyway)</br></br>  All waifus are beautiful.<br><br>Which three adjectives would you use to describe your waifu?</br></br>  Would you rather play a visual novel in which you waifu is a heroine or one where she's the protagonist?  <br>What I'd rather have isn't really an option.</br>  <br><br>Goodnight!<br><br><br>Sure. It's really nice to know he has a real friend, especially one as nice as Maka. <br><br><br>Blind would be much worse overall.<br><br><br>Depends on my mood, I guess.

It means that she appears more in the story and it explores her thoughts and motivations to a greater extent. Plus, it doesn't treat her primarily as an object of affection for the MC.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here she is with Suzu and Fuuri. <br><br><br>I'd rather go deaf. It will be very sad not to hear her ever again, but I want to see her smile. <br><br><br>Cuddling on a rainy day sounds better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I would  <br> Was this actually any good? <br>Only when she was around.<br> Is that qt main/best girl? <br>Yes, got 75% support from the poll after last episode.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dunno if the starting chapters are good, I skipped ahead to where the anime is now and went from there and I enjoyed it</br>  <br><br>Surely it can't get more retarded than this guy.</br></br>  <br> dumb slut <br>She's trying to get another Goldof.</br></br>  An Aztec setting for once is kinda refreshing.

She kept my trembling legs moving, supported my heart as the pressure bore down on it, and kept me in a position to make jokes. With Index, things may have been too focused on magic. With Othinus, it would have been exclusively about Magic Gods and having a clear understanding of their strength might have crushed me with despair. It was because it was Misaka. I survived this long because she was the one by my side. She saved my life and you want me to tell her to back off because she’s in the way? Who the hell do you think you are!? You don’t understand the first thing about the human emotion of this human world, but you’re trying to act like some all-knowing god!!!!!!”  <br><br> “So take it back, you piece of shit Magic God!! If you badmouth the person who saved my life any more, I’ll go punch you just like you want!!”  <br><br> “I don’t care if you’re covered in magma or if you’re over one thousand degrees! Imagine Breaker? I don’t need that for you and I don’t care if it doesn’t work on you! I don’t care if my fist melts away or if my entire body bursts into flames. Yeah, if you don’t shut that filthy mouth of yours right this instant, I’ll keep punching you until you finally do!!!!!!”  <br><br>Based Touma.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>#6 Level 5: Anti Kamijou Field is best girl tbh</br>  <br>Enjoy your shitty ship teasing with no payout</br>  <br> Othinus isn't just another one-and-done girl like Itsuwa, they said. <br>Is this a typo? Did you mean to say *is just another one and done? Because that's what I see said the most and is what got debunked this volume not the opposite</br></br>  <br>Holy fucking shit my sides</br>  <br>That's your rationalization based on mere sales. Mikoto is most popular and even if she can't help sales, then the most logical conclusion is that Index is losing steam a lot more than we imagined based on past sales (the decline is undeniable over the years since NT started). When the LN ranking comes around and Mikoto is still most popular Index character, but has dropped some ranks, you'll know this to be true.</br>  Is she the best girl?  Someone please kill Misora. She's by far the biggest offender in this show.  <br>Im also so close to dropping, the MC literally screams "self insert here pls", so bland</br>  You people can continue debating over who's the worst girl, meanwhile I'll just enjoy my socially retarded Touyama Nao in peace. Although a Rico would be fine too.<br><br>What the fuck.</br></br>  <br>The only girl I see who's better than her is the grating and annoying extreme shy moeblob. So not really.</br>  So who's the blond guy who fell in love with twintails? Is he an important character? Why does this show really like wet crotch joke?</blockquote>]
