It's not</br>  <br>is this guy a kurusu too? <br>when will there be a female one?</br></br>  <br>We don't know that. It is very likely, but that information came from a hallucinating zombie.<br>So yeah.</br></br>  <br> It was aliens all along! <br>That's not true tho.</br></br>  <br> reading manga online <br><br> helping someone read manga online <br>You both should know better than this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Conchita Wurst saves the day once again!</br>  <br>This manga desperately needs someone who played Cataclysm.</br>  <br>The fact that it got as much time as it did at the end of the volume I think lend it credibility. Surely you don't waste that much time if it isn't true.</br>  <br>Yeah, If they were in a hivemind then why were the other zombies confused as to what he was talking about if it wasn't just the usual delusions they spew out?</br>  <br> new release <br> not reading it online <br><br>Unless you go to shit sites the quality is exactly the same and unless you have shit internet, it loads instantly.<br><br>I only download series if I'm binging them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it reminded me of gantz the way they're in Italy.. although I can't see this turning to shit like gantz did</br>  <br>Yeah he was blonde with short hair before. The main girl is a kurusu.</br>  <br>I'm waiting for the reveal that the USA is responsible for everything</br>  <br> Yeah he was blonde with short hair before.  <br>Wait, am i missing something?</br></br>  <br>He explained it, they were chosen as the caretakers. Somewhat disconnected from the hivemind.</br>  <br>Much earlier chapter. We see him walking around Italy with fuzzy memory. You'll have to go through I can't remember which.</br>  <br> It's aliens <br>Thank fuck I dropped this shit back at the neet imageboard story arc.<br>Apparently everything after that went to fucking shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Says you. Aliens in only a theory but regardless, it's all done extremely well. This manga just has masterful pacing.</br>  I still find it hilarious that there were a bunch of zombies having a conversation up there.  <br> We see him walking around Italy with fuzzy memory. You'll have to go through I can't remember which. <br>I'm pretty sure that blonde guy was walking around paris, then that zombie centipede thing crushed the church he was in.</br></br>  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUCCCCKKK WHHYYYYYY<br>;____;</br>  <br> not binging IAAH from the start every new release </br>  ITT: pic releated (from Hungary)  Sao<br>SnK<br>Elfen lied <br>mirai nikki</br></br></br>  Anything Ghibli.

It may be overrated, but it is far from the regular overrated trash anime. The story was well executed, it didn't contain any of the awful anime clichés. The main reason why it seems to be hated so much on /a/ is cause of its eginess.  <br>We don't really have weebs in Romania, so I can't tell, but back in my school days people were all over Naruto.</br>  <br> The story was well executed <br> you killed my siblings, but I forgive you <br> well executed </br></br></br>  <br>That was 3 minutes ending scene</br>  <br><br><br>Edgy stuff simply makes them think they are full.<br><br>The key is to make them blindingly uncomfortable.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a mostly naked autistic girl running around mweeing and then switching to evil and ripping heads off.

I mean, EL is a mediocre and pretentious show, but it has its moments of entertainment value if you are willing to accept that the whole thing is stupid and switch your brain off. So while it's definitely overrated by newfags, it isn't so greatly over-praised that it matters in general.<br><br>Clannad on the other hand is the biggest complex of bizarrity I've seen hailed as a masterpiece by anime fans at large. You'd think it would be shit on and considered a sentimental newb trap for all the same reasons Lied is, but for whatever reason only the most self serious people do so and most of the affection it gets seems genuine.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  it didn't contain any of the awful anime cliché </br>  <br>The LRD popsicle is good for that.</br>  Fairy tail maybe.

So why do people like SAO so much<br> The MC is a gary stu  <br> There are no respectable females in his Harem maybe except for Sinon <br> even though Kirito and Asuna are dating their 'friends' still want Kirito's dick <br> Season 1 was spoiled because Kirito had to fucking fall in love and pretending to get married <br> the antagonist forgot his reason for trapping people inside a game <br><br>If this wasn't a Harem and Kirito didn't fall in love with Asuna SAO season 1 first half would've have been better</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dead Leaves is cool as fuck though.</br>  <br>actually to add on to this why does every MMO have<br> Overpowered MC <br> harem genre  <br> week ass villians  <br> dull story lines <br>i think the only anime with a game based theme was Accel world that was done right when it came to MC and story</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I haven't spoken to anyone about anime outside of /a/ since Inuyasha was popular.  Damn, SnK, SAO and Naruto/DBZ/One Piece<br>really make the holy trinity of anime cancer.</br>  <br>Its literally because its a self-insert fantasy.</br>  <br>Kanker zeg.<br>As a teen I was one of those faggots who tried to convince every Dutch normie anime was more then violence and sex. I've given up over time and have accepted that the Dutch will never like our Chinese cartoons.<br>Also, the Dutch fanbase that does exist is literally cancer.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, this is the first time I've come back to /a/ in 5 years (I've been on mostly /v/ during that time), they're attacking anime too now? Is nothing sacred anymore?</br>  <br> Russia got very good taste! <br>Too bad you don't.</br></br>  Germany here. It's not even their taste what bothers me the most. For me the worst thing are the reasons they like certain shows. One time speaking with someone or see someone who just watched some anime post on a normalfag forum is just painful. Just read proxer comments from certain shows. I don't understand how anybody could be this stupid. Or the rating system there. (Animation, Story, Music, Character etc.) These people have no fucking idea what they're talking about.  <br> One time speaking with someone or see someone who just watched some anime post on a normalfag forum is just painful. <br>I avoid youtube comments for this reason. I can't count how many times I've mindlessly scrolled down to see someone mention amazing animation and UBW/Zero in the same sentence.</br></br>  <br> go at a friend's house <br> two other people are there, another friend of mine and a girl I had never seen before <br> she's wearing a death note t-shirt <br> ohboy.jpg <br> my friend picks up the computer and turns it on <br> he tells me completely out of the blue he's watching FMA <br> reply without thinking 'that's great' <br> 'hey do you like fullmetal alchemist?' asks the girl <br> realize the mistake I just made, but there's no turning back now <br> 'yes I guess' <br> 'OHMYFUCKINGGOD ED IS SO COOL HOLY SHIT' <br> 'I guess he is...' I say and immediately after I try to change argument before shit goes down <br> 'AND ENVY TOOOO MY GOOOOOOOD IT'S MY FAVORITE ANIME EVER' <br> she went on for five minutes ranting about how cool Ed and Envy were without mentioning ANYTHING else about the show itself while the three of us sat in an awkward silence <br> mfw <br><br>I wish I was kidding. I mean come on, if you want to make an autistic rant about something at least try to make a decent point or to hold an interesting argument at the very least. <br>It looked as if she only even remembered Envy and Ed from the show and literally nothing else, like they were the only reason she even watched it in the first place.<br><br>And no, I'm not german.  And no, she wasn't a qt. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Poland: we just don't care </br>  <br> Gintama <br> Overrated <br>I'm assuming you didnt watch it? S;G and GTO are also good. The thread is meant to be overrated.</br></br></br>  Spain here. Nothing surprising: SAO, Snk and OP. The only specially irritating thing about casuals here is the insane amount of Snk fandubs and the insistence of showing it to everyone. Fucking shit.  <br>Columbian here<br> DBZ <br> Naruto <br> One piece </br></br></br></br>  Britfag here. Most of the weebs I know watch the typical SAO, SnK, Elfin Lied, Mirrai Nikki, DBZ and Ghibli movies. I have a co worker that only watched this shit in english dub but I somehow got him to watch NNB and he loved it. He's now watching Ika Musume and he's enjoying that too.  Talking about this I wonder which race has the most weeaboos. I think it's either Blacks, or Latino's.  Saint Seiya.<br>Try to guess my country.</br>  DBZ ----&gt; Argentina<br><br>Normal fags love that shit</br></br>  <br><br>this is fandub<br><br>and the yattaman is at least 20 years old... but still, manga in poland is waaaay more popular.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Latinos, no contest</br>  <br><br>Latinos</br></br>  <br>Latinos</br>  <br>I'll go with Latinos</br>  Dragonball<br>Saint Seiya<br>Naruto<br>SAO<br>Death Note<br>Mirai Nikki/elfen lied<br>Fairy tail<br>Tokyo Ghoul<br><br>in that order  odio el mal gusto de mi pais </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying those three shows aren't completely overrated everywhere </br>  <br>Some website compiled the most searched porn in each country<br><br>Mexico and the Philippines were the only ones with "hentai" as a top search, even Japs prefer 3D porn on average</br></br></br>  <br>Why do you hate fun? I didnt personally like S;G, but it was pretty well written and had good characters and story, GTO and Gintama are quality 80% of the time so I dont know what your problem is.</br>  <br> De donde eres, anon? </br>  <br><br><br><br><br>How did this even happen I wonder?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm guessing that hentai only includes animated hentai and not doujins</br>  <br>That and SnK. How does this crap get so popular with normies?</br>  <br>Blood and gore</br>  <br>Disney has been overrated for a long, long time.</br>  <br/>  <br>  tacoland, me molesta que la gente no sale de Dragonball, memes de Goku y el drama con el doblaje latino </br>  <br>normies don't like sexualized little girls or generic school harems. <br><br>Just action and adventure</br></br></br>  <br><br>To be honest, MN gets way too much shit than it should. The anime is decent and although it wasn't 100% faithful to the manga in some parts it was still pretty good, despite a few plotholes (which all anime has).<br><br>The manga was a masterpiece though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What do you mean?<br><br>No lolis and no fanservice. It doesn't involve them with muh degeneracy</br></br></br>  <br>Latinos, for example here in México the "Otaku/freak pride parade" it's a thing</br>  <br>Jesus christ how horrifying</br>  <br>ah, yes, "Orgullo Friki"<br><br>Fuck that.</br></br></br>  <br>Yep<br> Lo más gracioso que he visto hacer a un DBfag fue pedir traer Fukkatsu no F meses antes de lo ya anunciado, argumentando que eso iba a aumentar las posibilidades de que fuera la pelicula más taquillera del año en general.<br>En resumen el chico sinceramente pensaba que DB iba a poder con Avengers, Jurassic World y Star Wars.<br>Ah y eso sí, quería la película antes y doblada además.</br></br> </br></br>  <br>Fuck sakes are all the girls ugly in mexico</br>  Naruto<br>Bleach<br>Dragonball<br>Death Note<br>SAO<br><br>From Lithuania</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Showing your power level at all <br> Malditos otakus, me dan asco </br></br>  <br>Good god why</br>  <br> that pony </br>  DBZ<br>SnK<br>One Piece<br>Naruto<br>Death Note<br>SAO<br>FMA<br><br>C A N A D A B O Y Z</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah<br>If this picture was taken in a weekend like I assume, the qts are on a date with their Bf at some Mall or at Centro Histórico.</br></br>  <br>This guy looks the best</br>  <br>The anime is shit. Read the goddamn manga for fuck's sake.<br><br>On topic, definitely Dragon Ball.<br><br> Poland. Yeah, I know. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't know since I don't use any Polish forums, but today on the bus I saw a girl with pin button with Kaga from Golden Time.</br>  <br>Mexican people are ugly as fuck</br>  <br>Of course he does, It's Eggman</br>  <br>Its an Anime pride parade for the love of god. Our anime dweebs aren't any better looking either.</br>  <br><br>a few cosplayers or young new "otaku girls" are pretty/cute but weeabo girls usually are ugly,</br></br>  <br><br>DBZ and Naruto airing in public tv.</br></br>  <br>But mexican people in general are ugly, not just weebs</br>  <br>Bom dia, anão.</br>  <br>Why there's no mexicans cosplaying Sailor Moon? It's not such a big embarrassment without this fandom, meh</br>  <br> implicando que o mais popular no brasil não é Saint Seiya </br>  <br>Most people in general are ugly or otherwise average. Weebs transcend everything and are 99.99% ugly.</br>  <br>Saint Seiya<br>Naruto<br>Death Note<br>Shingeki<br><br>hue</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>All people in general are ugly</br></br>  I don't even interact with weeaboos anymore so I don't know  I don't even know what cocalombianos watch, probably DBZ, Naruto, Death Note and SnK.  <br>Exactamente esos, y los mas viejos ven Saint Seiya; que gusto de mierda el de la gente de aquí</br>  <br>Ausfag reporting in stating that this statement is true, an SAO fanboy got pissed at me for saying the truth that SAO isn't original with the MMO ordeal since dotHack and other animes did it way before SAO, everybody worships those animes here and keep talking about shit tier waifu Asuna while I'm still loyal to fingering mio's bass</br>  Why are Latino weebs so ugly? I hide my powerlevel just to avoid talking to a bunch of ugly mulatos. <br>The have the worst taste of all races, too.</br>  <br> K-On <br>But then again its not SAO, atleast.<br><br><br>My favorite anime is NagiAsu, come at me bro.</br></br></br></br></br>  Mountainous seams are over.

How did it do, sales-wise? Be it BDs or goodies.  I did my part   <br> How did it do, sales-wise <br>Absolutely average.</br></br>  <br>This picture will probably be better if it's F/8 instead of F/2</br>  <br>Yeah I made a mistake with this one, but whatever. Here's another one I posted yesterday.<br><br><br>Now I'm sad</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's all about the tourism and whether Kokona's VA wants to fund another season anyway.</br>  <br>Which mountain is this?</br>  <br>French Alps, Vanoise massif</br>  <br>I want to commit a heinous crime</br>  I want to tear her seams.  <br><br>How can she be so pure and so lewd at the same time? How does that even work?</br></br>  <br>Hinata and Kokona should hook up their parents together.</br>  <br>Tengumom and Futamom?</br>  Has anyone actually watched the live event rip?  <br>No subs, no watch</br>  I'm gonna hike up a small hill today, wish me luck /a/nons.  <br>I wish you good luck</br>  How well did it help out the sponsors? Japan's national parks and Saitama prefecture paid for this, if they got a good return its should get more episodes.  Those stockings are cute as fuck. I should really watch S2 of this.    <br>The manga's publisher said they want to make more seasons, a thread a while ago posted the tweets</br>          <br>That's some intense hardcore mountain climbing.</br>  <br>RIP, anon.</br>  How many people here have tried to hike up a hill or mountain after watching this show?  <br>It made me want to do more outdoorsy things in general.<br><br>Not a lot of hills or mountains around me. A few hiking places are, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Posts like these are not accepted in a tibetan mountain climbing board such as /a/.</br>  <br>it was the greatest day of my life, anon</br>  <br>i climbed Mt. Takao when i went to japan, went the opposite route they did though</br>  <br>why would you go any other route?</br>  <br>b/c the route they went up (route 1 i think) is nothing but walking up super steep roads until you hit the top</br>  <br>nawww, its only super steep half the way. once you get to the top cable car station it flattens out considerably. still a few stairs to get to the temples, but they are nothing after doing that god forsaken slope. theres also checkpoint signs showing facts about the mountain/wildlife as you go up.</br>  <br>Mah nigga</br>  <br>i went down route 1, but went up the nature path</br>  <br>Finally did it <br><br>Other than this small clearing showing the land below, that's all there is to this hill, with the small hiking trail eventually leading to a sealed off water supply tank at the top. <br><br>And no sightings of mountain lolis either. Maybe on the climb?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good job, anon.</br>  <br>Only mountain grandmothers here.</br>  <br><br>Where do you live?</br></br>  <br>I would love them to do that on either side of the head of my climbing pole.</br>  <br>Asian country, Malaysia</br>  Why was this show so good? The direction was way above typical moe SoL.  <br>Motivational to explore the world</br>  <br>That sounds an awful lot like you're wanting their dismembered heads on your pole.</br>  Yama no Susume doesn't need BD sales to get another season, it needs more people buying mountain gear since it's literally an advertainment show. Or did you guys miss all the product placement?  Remember the white piggu characters from the Fuji arc? Baiting people like that is exactly what the show is about.   nothing can fill the void after finishing season 2   <br>Climb a mountain and relive the series</br>  <br>Everyone needs to go to Takao and buy flying squirrel keychains and eat fried dango.</br>  <br>But I'm sure buying the BDs directly gives more chance of another season rather than randomly buying expensive mountain gears. And I don't have anyone else to bring along hiking either</br>  <br>The anime is exact 1:1 reproduction of the manga right?</br>  I need to see more pictures of anons at the mountains.  <br>No, not at all. The original manga is actually science fiction, Aoi and Hinata were raised on a space station and visit different planets to mountain climb. Kaede was a half-alien with blue skin.</br>  <br>From which unfathomable dimension is this tentacled terror of the abyss from?</br>  <br> heinous crime <br>By that do you mean  head-patting  her or  admiring  her in a swimsuit?</br></br>  <br>No, there were filler episodes and for some reason the anime reduced Aoi's father's screentime, you barely even remember he was there.</br>  3rd season when?  <br>So how many orphans are there in this show?</br>  <br>I want to marry her lonely mother and therefore legalise me doing this to her</br>  <br>If another one year passed after this and no more news about YnS is released, then I'm afraid the dream is all over.</br>  <br>No one. Aoi has both parents, Hinata has her dad, Kokona has her mom, and you can assume Kaede's parents are just working in another place like how most anime parents are.</br>  <br>So two half orphans, and Kaede is almost an adult herself. Their houses are really huge however, and I don't see/remember them having siblings</br>  <br> how most anime parents are <br>I assume this isn't an accurate portrayal of an average urban Japanese residence?</br></br>    <br> Their houses are really huge however <br>Except Kokona's house. Hinata's house was based on a real library in Hanno and it is huge for for a normal Japanese household. I don't know if Aoi's or Kaede's house is based on a real house.<br><br> and I don't see/remember them having siblings <br>For some reason most of the characters are single child, I don't know why.<br><br><br> I assume this isn't an accurate portrayal of an average urban Japanese residence? <br>It isn't, kids stay with their parents until high school usually.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Only three people lives in this castle.  This is how she gets extra spending money  <br>12 years old.<br>Or something like that.</br></br>  <br>If I remembered she's just a year older than the main pair, and they're probably 13-14 y/o.</br>  Commencing short profile dump          <br>What's that last line indicating? That's the only one I can't infer</br>    <br><br><br><br>Why is Coconut facing to the left?</br></br></br></br>  <br>花言葉？Language of the flowers?</br>  <br>It's strange to see that she has the exact same sizes as the average japanese 15 year old.</br>  <br>No, the last one in the grey box.<br><br>That was useful too, tho.</br></br></br>  <br>3 characters facing right, and 3 characters facing left, probably purposely symmetrical.</br>  <br>誕生花 or birth flower. I guess it's similar to birth stones or something.</br>  <br>Ah, thanks anon.</br>  Well if you guys can translate and post here what those moon runes mean in the posted profile, I can also create a combined translated chart of the characters. I can only guess what some of those are  <br>Age<br>Height<br>Weight<br>Cup Size<br>Blood Type<br>Birthday<br>Birth Flower<br><br>Dunno what the extra box means, besides what  posted.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's what their flower represents in flower language for example Aoi has "a small happiness"</br>  <br>what does it says in Coconut's cup size field?</br>  <br><br>Aoi Yukimura<br>Age: 15<br>Weight: 43kg<br>Cup Size: A<br>Blood Type: B<br>Birthday: Feb 19<br>Birth flower: Violet<br>Language of the flower: Little happiness</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't wear it yet.</br>  <br>"Only slightly developed" is my best guess. Maybe some anons better than me can clarify.</br>  <br>https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A<wbr>A%95%E7%94%9F%E8%8A%B1</wbr></br>  <br> Language of the flower: Little happiness <br>This sounds extremely cute</br></br>  <br>"Only a slight bump" or "close to nothing."</br>  <br>small happiness<br>honest love<br>selfish beauty<br>always lovely<br>tender love<br>good news<br><br><br>probably</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Hinata Kuraue<br>Age: 15<br>Height: 155cm<br>Weight: 47kg<br>Cup Size: B<br>Blood Type: A<br>Birthday: Nov 11<br>Birth flower: Viola<br>Language of the flower: Faithful Love</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Kokona is the fittest.</br>  <br>She can only afford to eat once every two days; and on that note, I don't think it's really possible for kokonamum to actually make all of her daughter's clothes herself, especially since it looks almost as good as store-bought ones.</br>  <br>I don't know what you're talking about, but Kokona never had problem with her strength, if anything she was always rocking mountaineering, is perfect, and a fit girl will rarely have visible under clothes breasts.</br>  <br><br>Are those 'flowers' descriptions on the same level as blood types? As in, nothing really concrete as age/cup size but is what the nips believe to determine their personality/behaviour?</br></br>  <br>Don't know how it's coming along for you but I gave it a try. Font isn't spectacular but whatever.</br>  <br>She's a little miracle, too perfect to exist in this wretched world.</br>  <br>I want to pluck Kokona's birth flower.</br>  <br>Sure go on ahead with every other profiles, since you've already started it anyway. I'm thinking more of creating everything from scratch, with colors and screenshots from the show itself, but of course I'd need proper translations first since I know shit about Japanese language and the apparent subtlety here. Likely won't be posting in this thread, I'm hammered as shit now and waiting for the weekend to come. Thanks for the help</br>  <br>It's up to you, colored profiles and screenshots sounds like a much better idea. I wasn't entirely sure what you meant at first. Seems like the most difficulty you'll run into are the flower names and flower language as the majority of the general terms are already translated now. If you do plan on making a colorful chart, I look forward to it.<br><br>Don't drink too much.</br></br></br>  <br>Coconuts are very dangerous creatures within, and any person with malicious intent should approach with extreme caution.</br>  Can someone post that compilation image that has lots of Hinata's grins?  <br>I only have her rape face.</br>  <br><br> shit eating grin </br></br>  <br> tongue pulling </br>  Do not think bad things  Is it too late to declare my love for Hinata?  <br> All of those related videos <br> One of the original videos tags is "mountain lolis" </br></br>  <br>I bought them at 50% discount way back.<br><br>Why is no one else buying them?!</br></br></br>  <br>They probably got a mountain of them for cheap.

Thankfully, it's innocent more often than anything.</br>  I miss it.  <br><br>Let it live!<br><br>This anime had the most HNNNNG inducing cute face animations in all of the anime I have seen.

We absolutely need more Yama no Susume. Rewatching the OVA, it was such a fun and enjoyable show. Even hearing the main theme when they parody the scene where they reach the summit was enough to get me to tear up. Hopefully they weren't joking when they said "see you someday again".<br><br><br>Need to keep buying merchandise to get another season. Nice wallpaper by the way.</br></br></br>  <br>Sure is nice having a defective monitor</br>  <br>It's not my main monitor, so it doesn't bother me too much.

I'll post mine when I get it from customs.</br>  <br>well finally an anime did americans right</br>  <br>I'm thinking about another pair for that cheap, I preordered them and it's hard to keep Aoi clean.<br><br>Kokona lives in the closet. Poor Kokona, so poor.</br></br></br>  <br> hard to keep Aoi clean <br>Dude just hand wash them. Also what the heck are you doing to it to make it that dirty. My daki usually lasts for 5 months before I see some noticeable browning due to dead skin cells.</br></br>  <br><br>So by the time I have enough money and time to get all these, they would've already either been sold out, out of production, all bought or end up rotting in a forgotten corner in a dark warehouse?</br></br>  <br>How fast can you get to Vegas/Atlantic City?</br>  <br>You gotta do that thing.</br>  <br><br>Bathe them at the nearest pool/stream and pretend that you're self inserting into this image</br></br>  <br>No, most of this had very limited production runs and could only be had by going to an event - for example the little enameled pins above the water bottles were from the Hannou thing in April this year, they're impossible to find now, since fans don't give up tihis stuff and fans are the only ones who ended up with it.</br>  <br>Still needs a Kaede and a Hinata Daki.</br>  <br> Hinata Daki <br>I want a Nendo.</br></br>  <br>You could coax them out, for the right price.<br>I'm sure if you kidnapped the VA cast you could trade them in for most of the gear.</br></br>  <br>They'll only make one if one hundred anons promise to take her to Takao-san.</br>  <br>I'd rather just take her up my local mountain.<br>But if Takao's what it takes to get a Hinata, I'd do it.</br></br>  <br>99 more!</br>  <br>I don't get it; explain further</br>  <br>Gambling is how to get a lot of money quickly, didn't you watch Kaiji?</br>  <br>you should also take her up tenranzan while you're there.</br>  <br> I thought you mean that the store is actually in Atlantic City </br>  <br>Not living in Japan is suffering.</br>  <br>I know, I think about it every day.</br>  <br>Work hard and reach your dream anon.</br>  <br>Aoi gets bullied by everyone.</br>  <br>That hand though.<br><br> gotta love petenshi </br></br></br>  <br>It's because of how bulliable she is. After all she does all crafts are small.</br>  <br>He does the best half person h-doujin.</br>  Aoi on a bike, I want this doujin so bad  <br> you can't buy them, nor any of the other super rare things he has hanging on the wall <br><br> the CHAOS backpack <br> right there in all its glory <br><br>Kill me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The probability of him saying yes to your offer increases proportionally to the amount of money that you're giving.</br>  <br>At best, I would be able to go during the winter. Though I doubt any offer I could provide would be enough to have him part with it. Being poor is suffering.</br>  <br>I want to suck on her tiny fingers.</br>  <br>It's ok anon, Coconut-chan teaches us that we don't need to buy expensive things to experience the same joy and love as those who do. Just keep the Yamas in your heart, and everything will be wonderful.</br>  <br>But expensive things are comfy.</br>  <br>If nothing else, I want to meet the store owner. A fan as big as he is keeping the cause alive and introducing others to it. He deserves some recognition.</br>  <br><br>Where was this place? So this guy runs a store, but keeps a small section of it filled with unbuyable merchandise? <br><br>forwhatpurpose.jpg</br></br></br></br>  <br>You'd suck his dick?</br>  <br>Don't get ahead of yourself, you have to take him out to dinner first. No, the kind of recognition where you buy him a beer and tell him to keep up the good work.</br>  <br>Pitch a tent just like they do at the beginning of S2!</br>  <br>Personally I'd gladly suck the cock of anyone who loves the Yamas that much, he deserves it. If he wants of course.</br>  <br>Make sure to wear a wig like Hinata's hair and the proper schoolgirl outfit.</br>  <br>Camp out in front of the place and refuse to leave until he lets you buy up some of the merchandise.</br>  <br>He would either let you buy it for extravagant prices or call the police.<br><br>Maybe just ignore you.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure if you reenacted Les Miserables he'd eventually give.</br>  It's simple, just invent time travel and go back to the events and get the merch.  <br> Where was this place? <br>Hanno.<br><br> forwhatpurpose.jpg <br>Tourism.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hina is a fucking beast</br>  <br>Where can I buy that green jacket?</br>  <br><br>I want to run my perverted hand all over her hair</br></br>  I want to climb a mountain so bad. There aren't any "official" mountains where I live and the most mountain-like hill is very, very far. Even if you manage to catch public transportation about once a year nearby, you still have to hike for a long time. People recommend at least 7 days and I don't know if I'm cut for 7 days of walking trough the wilderness.  <br> Live in Florida </br>  <br>Better start lifting now and get some sikk gains</br>  <br>Does it mean you have the same situation or mountains everywhere? I wouldn't be able to tell</br>  Are there any other mountain climbing documentaries or films that I should watch while waiting for that S3?  This animu good?    <br> Intrude qt camera chan <br> oh hey let's end the show right here guys! <br>Fuck them</br></br></br>  Those mountains, that crevice. <br><br>I want to encourage the fuck out of those.</br></br>  <br>You could watch and find out, as it's only 3 minutes long<br><br><br>How long did you spend coming up with that?<br><br>I actually find her the least sexual. There's something about the face.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not following your route <br><br>Worst girl.</br></br></br>  I really regret not getting the nendo and hiking/camping accessories.  Grown up Aoi is sex. <br><br><br>It was spontaneous. You're the least sexual.</br></br></br>  <br>My  heart </br>  <br>You wouldn't say that if you saw me, anon</br>  <br>Reel Rock? It's more rock-climbing oriented, though.</br>  <br>Brokeback mountain</br>  How much of the released material did the anime cover?<br><br><br>Fuck off, you're probably French and smell of elderberries.</br></br></br>  <br>I hate all French<br>Maybe I'll take your virginity at the mountains, and only afterwards I'll reveal my true identity as the shitty anon you hate</br></br>  <br> I had only 10 minutes to watch an episode of Yama no Susume and fap before leaving. <br> I did both at the same time with that episode. <br><br>Forgive my sins.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>  hating Frogs <br><br>W-Why would you hate me, I-I thought we were all Yamabros</br></br></br></br>  <br>To whom did you came too</br>  <br> On my plane trip to Japan I sat on front of French. It was a night flight but they kept the entire plane wide awake and even prevented the flight attendants from moving on hallways as they took so much space. Considering the languages on the flight were English and Japan they never spoke anything outside French and still demanded service. But no doubt you are wonderful and lovely person anon  Spoiler for blogshit</br>  <br>I forgive you, but I hate you bitterly</br>  <br> To that scene in the webm. I'm normally a loli man, but I'd climb those mountains. </br>  <br>EGGUSCUSE ME</br>  <br>You didn't last long, did you?<br><br>SHHHH~</br></br></br>  <br>oh, s-sumimasen.</br>  <br>Knowing a decent amount of french makes me glad I could tell any french fucks like those off if I ever were to encounter them  outside of france, of course. </br>  <br>I want to fap to the susumes too</br>  <br>dostedt</br>  <br> Once I got out the plane one tried to jump the queue, and I told him off with my native language. Seemed to do the trick too as they behaved pretty politely afterwards. </br>  <br>AND REMEMBER<br><br>REMEMBER WHEN THAT GUY ASKED YOU TO DO THAT THING</br></br></br>  Show should be renamed to flat lands  <br>It's Monty Python.</br>  <br>I will have a cute daughter like Aoi someday and we'll go hiking together</br>  <br>And you'll fuck her in the mountains?</br>  <br> Hiking </br>  <br> climbing </br>  <br>Lewd!</br>  <br> you'll never have a cute daughter like Aoi to go climbing with </br>  <br> you'll never have a daughter who brings along all her cute friends to play around everyday <br><br>Just kill me</br></br></br>  <br>The anime covered most of volumes 1-4, and some of volume 5 (the baito, mostly). Volume 9 just came out in Japan, so there's a good amount of material left.</br>  <br>Translations never.</br>  <br>The bra episode is actually in volume 6 though, so it does jump around.<br><br>  Aoi still hasn't made it up Fujisan </br></br></br>  <br>Why are their knees red?</br>  <br>Never say never anon.</br>  <br>I remembered that Hinata never actually wore any bra during the show despite having this episode</br>  <br>Stylistic choice, far better than having shiny ones. It makes them look perfectly soft overall, like those blushing cherubs. Besides aren't knees slightly darker than the surrounding skin?</br>  <br>It's the same here.

Better luck next thread. Start it with air superiorty next time.</br></br></br>  <br>I accept what you said. We entrusted the oceans to you after WW2. With that it's only natural for US to become both the best aerial and naval force in the world. US would win against many of the European powers because our doctrines complete each other.</br>  <br>The problem with US is that it can't fight a real war without having a complete, overwhelming advantage. If the defending army doesn't consist of farmers with half-century old weapons, but has at least comparable strength, the attacker (US) will suffer heavy losses despite still probably winning most battles. US "soldiers" would riot if they won't have fresh burgers and cold cola and when their losses pass not mere hundreds, but many thousands, and dozen thousands, the people of US itself would riot and cry to stop the war.</br>  Anyone else is gonna drop the anime if it reaches the mango?  <br> autism over. cute girls time </br>  <br>manga slow as fuck though</br>  <br>Get out of here, Elf and Loli.</br>  <br>but muh /ak/</br>  <br>These are the manga chara designs?

Thus elves reproduce better with non-elves. </br>  <br> Do we still get to see them afterwards? <br>Most of them still get cameos. He'll be with them during the garden party Pina holds.<br>That's the last you'll see them together though.<br>It's only Kuribayashi who you'll be seeing a lot with Itami.<br> She might make a return to heroine status in S2. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No he doesn't.  Despite having a fresh harem, he only manages 1 child after all that time. <br><br>Also, WTF google? Bikes?</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure CR didn't sub it, and these are subs from the studio.</br>  <br>So he's  Dawhite Howard? </br>  <br><br><br><br>We must protect the purity of elves. <br><br>They are an endangered species.<br><br>We have to  tenderly care for them, and wash their hair </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well the garden party is long before the Dark Elves act.<br><br>It still sucks though.<br><br> It's only Kuribayashi who you'll be seeing a lot with Itami. <br><br>This is better already.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They call Tuka as Chuka. Is it the same in CR?</br>  <br>That's what  orcs are for <br> I really got to stop </br></br>   ctrl+f <br> chuka <br> 1 found (at end of the thread) <br>Seriously /a/?<br>I thought this would be what you would be sperging about.<br><br>Also, did they add the bath scene? I don't remember bath from manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, they're CR subs, but I'm saying that CrunchyRoll doesn't subtitle some of their stuff. They let the studios just give them the subtitles sometimes.</br>  <br>GATE elves are a low fertility races so they compensate with high sexual desire to maximize pregnancy chance<br> Just look at her dad story or the orgy in Pina gaiden </br></br>  Leilei is the only good thing about this show. Glad I didnt drop this yet, this episode felt like the SDF actually has their priorities straight for once.  <br><br><br> They use f4's to blow the ever-loving fuck out of the senate building <br> fucking secondaries. </br></br></br></br>  <br>honestly i dont mind names being spelled differently, the way they are pronouncing it sounds more like chuka to me anyway, i think the bath scene replaced a few other scenes where the same is said but without the bathing</br>  <br> And when they aren't bombing imperials they are having fun in dogfighting dragons </br>  <br><br> having fun <br><br>They almost got roasted and had to run three laps around the runway for it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sound's like they're winning this Nam' than what what the American'ts lost</br>  <br>Totally worth it.</br>  <br>thats the definition of fun</br>  <br> Sound's like they're winning this Nam' than what what the American'ts lost <br>The difference is that they are not trying to take territory. JSDF has no intention of controlling anything but the lands that are in the perimeter of the fort. They don't have the resources to actually do a proper invasion.</br></br>  Wtf is with these rising glowing particles?<br><br>1/2</br></br>  <br><br>Fucking pilots man.</br></br>  <br> FRIENDSHIP MAGIC </br>  <br> Wtf is with these rising glowing particles? <br>Probably dead souls.

They're hardcoded to the movie. I only watched like five minutes, but they synced up fine and were legible. Just depends if you want better quality or not.</br>  <br>The Genjutsu was a Mangekyo Sharingan one. Basically, Sasuke's Sharingan was specialer.</br>  <br> If the Sharingan is able to break any Genjutsu <br>This was never confirmed. The sharingan HELPS, but it doesn't guarantee anything.</br></br>  <br>alright ill just mux it with the OP chink video then, there was some other reencode that used the camrip subs that was terribad.</br>  <br>It's been said that the Sharingan allows the user to see through all Genjutsu cast upon them. Although clearly it's not ALL Genjutsu, and I reckon  has the right idea - it's pretty much all, not including Genjutsu cast by a higher-level Sharingan.<br><br>That being said, Danzo's right eye was Shisui's who had a Mangekyou, meaning he still should've been able to see through it.<br><br>But pffft, plot holes.</br></br></br></br></br>  This is from the short manga which is about Naruto becoming Hokage.  <br>When was it said?</br>  <br>Also, there is a short new commercial trailer<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Pmz<wbr>wOZq878w&amp;feature=youtu.be</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>do we have TL-anon here?</br></br>  Naruto is not anime related  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128519831 <br><br>is this a new meme?</br></br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128519831 <br>retarded samefag</br></br>  <br> 3 irrelevant characters on the scan </br>  <br> new meme <br><br>Moot is rolling in his grave newfag</br></br></br>  @128520011<br>Who?</br>  This and the SnK thread  are cancer, yet /a/ isn't doing anything about them  <br>Thanks anon. Coffee everywhere.</br>  <br>remove all the moe and loli threads or basically waifu thread wit image dumps first</br>  <br> newfag calling others newfags <br><br>You're waifu a cancer.</br></br></br>  <br>If you can explain to me what precisely in this thread is cancer, I'll agree with you. Go ahead, I'm waiting.</br>  <br>SnK</br>  <br> newfag because oldmeme <br><br>Sick. /a/ you're on fire today.</br></br></br>  No bully pls guys  I still don´t get what is Boruto movie going to be about. Little fucker can already wreck everyone, what´s the point of that exam then ? <br><br>Which kid is going to bring biggest asspull against him ?</br></br>  <br>Because the show invites shitposting. You had your series end, but keep wondering why your threads get deleted every day. Let the series fucking rest.</br>  <br>I agree, but also Yahari, Kantai collection and pretty much every moe/kawai/waifu thread. Then we can talk.</br>  <br> the show invites shitposting <br>OK fair point. Now show me exactly which posts in this thread are shitposts.</br></br>  <br>IT'S HAPPENING. FILLER THAT I'M ACTUALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO!<br><br><br>I'd like to see Boruto breeze his way through the exams only to get destroyed by the most unassuming character.<br><br><br>It doesn't invite shitposting. It's that a ton of anons feel the need to be part of the 'in' group on /a/ for some reason, and the 'in' group shitpost on Naruto threads.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All of mine<br><br><br>This isn't "new", Naruto has been the redheaded step child of /a/ forever with moot protecting them. Now that moot is gone threads seem to be fair game.</br></br></br></br>  <br> kawai </br>  <br>I never said it was new, it's just that there's no reason for it. If Naruto threads were left alone, the people who want to talk about Naruto would stay there, and create a new thread when the old one ran out. As is it, threads get derailed, and a new one is made, which gets derailed, and a new one is made.<br><br>People who shitpost on Naruto threads can't see to grasp the concept of 'if I don't shitpost on Naruto threads, maybe Naruto threads wouldn't be full of shitposters'.</br></br></br>  <br>the context here is that Himawari wants to bring the bear to the inauguration ceremony, but Boruto is conviced he'll be the one who'll get stuck carrying it and end up embarrassed.</br>  <br>You can add all extra "i" you want. Be my guest.</br>  <br>Is this a thing that's out in English now, or only in Japanese?</br>  The 1080p version on nyaa has a dropbox link where you can download English subs for it that were uploaded by intruder.master.<br><br>Can anyone here verify if it's legit and if it works?</br></br>  <br> destroys birthday cakes <br> now stuffed animals too <br>Why is Boruto such a little shit?</br></br></br>  Was the Kakashi face chapter ever properly translated?  <br>I fucking love that picture so much. I didn't think I'd find a girl I liked more than Hinata, but god damn Himawari has just fucking got everything her mum had, but better.<br><br>Boruto is a cunt though, yeah.</br></br></br>  <br>Stealing a teddy bear from Himawari and ripping it apart?<br><br>Really Burrito?<br><br>Fuck this lil nigga.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where did he destroy cake ?</br>  <br>I don't know where that photo/scan came from, but there is apparently a pre-screening happening sometime this week (maybe even today).<br><br>That 17 page oneshot will be with the book given out at the movie, but I don't know if it 'll be given out in the pre-screening. But we'll definitely get that thing sooner than later.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is Bort such a little faggot?</br>  <br> Who is going to stop him ?</br>   Naruto has his own blimp <br>lel</br>  <br> himawari was conceived in that blimp </br>  <br>Grandpa Hiashi.<br><br>Ain't no one, BUT NO ONE, fucks with his little Hima-chan. Not even Boruto.</br></br></br>  <br>  Naruto and Hinata were the first shinobi to be members of the mile-high club </br>  <br>Dadruto uses Kagebunshins that each spank his ass.</br>  <br>Is that a train? Will they get a car then? Kek</br>  <br>Only he gets to treat his family members like expendables pieces of shit.</br>  <br>I'd like to see Hiashi backhand Boruto through a door. I'd like that a lot.</br>  <br> Naruto kids SOL </br>  Here is my sageru.    <br><br>I bet Boruto is even now stronger than grandschemer Hiashi and Dadruto don´t give a fuck. Give it 3 years and both edgelord and Dadruto won´ t be able to stop him if he decide to go serious.</br></br>  <br>As strong as Boruto is/will become, I don't think he'll be able to step to Super Ninja Jesus 1 and 2. He doesn't have Kurama, the Byakugan, or the Sharingan. He's just a kid with a good chakra pool and a few good teachers.</br>  <br>It's not that hard of an accomplishment, he and his slaves got buttfucked by fodder puppets.</br>  <br>He will probably develop Rinnegan and even without it he is able to make some bijuu his bitch.</br>  <br> If the Sharingan is able to break any Genjutsu, why was Danzo not able to see through Sasuke's Genjutsu on his arm with the one Sharingan he had left functioning in his right socket? <br><br>how did kakashi get caught in itachi's tsukuyomi?<br>answer:  kishi writing </br></br></br></br>  <br>How the dick would he develop the Rinnegan? He needs Uchiha DNA for that.<br><br><br>Plot holes? I think you mean creative writing!</br></br></br></br>  <br> Rinnegan <br>Get in time gramp. Tenseigan is the new cool</br></br>  <br>OVER THE FUCKING LINE!</br>  <br>It can break regular genjutsus if the victim knows he's on a genjutsu.<br><br>And Tsukuyomi is too OP.</br></br></br>  <br>Doesn´t matter if he have DNA from both demigod brothers.</br>  <br> only 6 years <br><br>What did she do to deserve this ?</br></br></br>  <br>Buuuuut he only has Senju DNA at this point. Unless Uncle Orochimaru comes over for a while, then that might change.</br>  Why the fuck did Hinata almost fall off the tower in the beginning when hanging from the scarf? BITCH YOU CAN WALK ON WALLS AND WATER<br><br>Why your ass fall into genjutsu when you can see the chakra flow from miles away? Why the fuck didn't she fall into the genjutsu in the first place when Hyuuga have top tier chakra control. <br><br>Why didn't Naruto just use Bijuu mode from the beginning and end this shit in seconds? Why was he using the vastly inferior KCM?<br><br>Why doesn't the Mizukage have a technique similar to Kisame's water dome? No wonder she's the weakest of the kages. <br><br>Why didn't Based Madara will himself back into existence and fuck Toneri up for being a pussy ass villain.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only Indra/Ashura reincarnations can develop the rinnegan.</br>  <br>How do you know the bear wasn't his to begin with?</br>  <br> Why the fuck did Hinata almost fall off the tower in the beginning when hanging from the scarf? BITCH YOU CAN WALK ON WALLS AND WATER <br>She didnt have any chakra left, Toneri absorbed all</br></br>  <br>Toneri absorbs Chakra.</br>  <br><br><br>So is the cakepocalypse supposed to be in like a flashback from around when nuduru was first hokage?<br>Burrito and Sunflower look about 12 and 9 during the time of the movie.<br><br>Or maybe just a random number of candles not corresponding to age?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn, he is really thirsty for her, sucked her dry.</br>  <br>If she didn't have ANY left, she'd be dead.<br><br>You're telling me she had so little she couldn't even do the simplest of shits. That's whack.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, it's just any Senju and Uchiha DNA. They don't HAVE to be Indra/Ashura reincarnations.<br><br>It's just that, you know, what with being mortal enemies, they don't generally have many kids with each other.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Question: If the Sharingan is able to break any Genjutsu, why was Danzo not able to see through Sasuke's Genjutsu on his arm with the one Sharingan he had left functioning in his right socket? <br><br><br>The Sharingan can see through Genjutsu but that does not mean the user can break free from it.<br><br><br><br> That being said, Danzo's right eye was Shisui's who had a Mangekyou, meaning he still should've been able to see through it. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Burrito is a lil bitch ass nigga.</br>  <br> You're telling me she had so little she couldn't even do the simplest of shits. That's whack <br>Yes.<br>The plot of the movie required a scene like that, and plot will always trump the internal logic of the setting.</br></br></br>  Fuck I hit enter by mistake<br><br> That being said, Danzo's right eye was Shisui's who had a Mangekyou, meaning he still should've been able to see through it. <br><br><br>Shisui's Sharingan was only available after the "recharge" time and that was after the whole genjutsu trickery and once he started to use it he was faster than Sasuke.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> When a movie is in the hands of a bad writer, the plot will always trump the internal logic of the setting <br>ftfy</br></br>  <br>He is not black and you seem to have just as bad logic as Kishimoto.</br>  <br>No, Hagoromo and Zetsu clearly state that you need Indra and Ashura's chakra.<br><br>Which only reincarnations have.</br></br></br>  <br>well most fiction except a few books are written badly so I guess you do not enjoy things much.</br>  <br>It is said right there and in another page that both indra and ashura chakra are needed.</br>  <br> When the movie's source material is already ridden with inconsistencies, one more will hurt no one <br>ftfy, seriously, you talking as if this was the first time this happened in Naruto</br></br>  <br>Most of everything is bad, yes. <br><br><br>Hey, let me talk my shit in peace.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>the plot simply required that as many red scarves as possible give their lives for the ship.<br><br>  chibi scarf - bullies <br>  hinata scarf mk. 1 - impromptu rope <br>  mk. 2 - combusted <br>  mk. 3 - survived? <br>  mk. 4 - being knit in post-credits <br><br>that woman must have the patience of a saint. I would have snapped after like the second time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She waited like 20+ years for Naruto, 18 or so of which consisted of him being completely oblivious to her.</br>  <br>How good are the dropbox subs in the 1080p version?</br>  <br>It's good practice and Hinata has a lot of love to give. <br>When you knit a scarf it takes a lot of time and the more love you put into it the longer it takes. <br><br>Now lose in one punch and let Hinata take the eyes out of your eye sockets.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly don't know, I haven't downloaded them. Apparently it requires dicking around with timings.</br>  <br>Have you downloaded the 1080p version? If so, would you mind tinkering around and seeing if the dropbox subs work?</br>  <br>They were only 19. Only 12 of those years were being in love with him.</br>  <br>Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh but it's 2:15am and I'm tired as fuck. If this thread is somehow not pruned by the time I wake up, I'll do it. Otherwise I'll start a new thread with results.<br><br><br>I generalised.

Can't I just technically download these subs to the 1080p version right now?</br>  I just checked and the guy who made the subtitles actually just posted the updated version with colored lines:<br>https://www.dropbox.com/s/wcm42zgz7<wbr>nowucl/The%20Last%20Naruto%20the%20<wbr>Movie.English_%5BFINAL%5D.ass?dl=0<br><br><br>Yeah, with the subtitles colored.

She barely showed up, but Jesus Christ I want to see more of her portrayed like that.<br><br>I want an arc dedicated to NaruHina dating shenanigans:<br><br>  Hanabi develops a small sisterly rivalry with Hinata over Naruto after he saves her life. Shenanigans ensure as Hanabi is clearly raunchier and more outgoing than Hinata. <br>  Naruto's first dinner at the Hyuuga household. Hanabi plays footsies with Naruto under the table, who thinks it's Hinata the whole time. <br>  Hiashi Hyuuga walking in on them making out <br>  Several missions that bring them closer together <br>  Naruto looking tenderly at Hinata as she sleeps and he keeps watch <br>  Hinata and Naruto share a kiss before the beginning and at the end of each mission. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OK, then how good are the subs?

It's absolute bullshit, and nothing is being done because our Government gives no shits about keeping up with the rest of the world.</br>  <br>His unrequited crush on Sarada.</br>  <br> Sakura's face <br><br>She should have clocked Naruto for being a retarded idiot.</br></br></br>  <br>why are hyuga clan bullies even a thing?</br>  <br>  Hey, let's pick on the daughter of one of the most powerful clans in the Village <br>  Ha ha yeah, there's no way this could end badly! <br><br>There is a near 100% chance that Hiashi fucking killed those kids and hid their bodies, explaining it away as 'Something something those damn Lightning ninja, whatcha gonna do?'</br></br></br></br>   same clothes <br><br>So Orochimaru is Mitsuki's dad?</br></br>  <br>what the fuck are these?</br>  <br> Sakura  <br><br>A blush because someone is in your face is not unrequited love.</br></br></br>   naruto has a dream <br> all of a sudden is no longer asexual <br> all of a sudden is in love with hinata <br>garbage</br></br></br>  <br>Covers for the gaiden's volume</br>  <br> Sakura criticizing anyone else being stupid about love. <br>Please look at who you are talking about here.</br></br>  <br>Anon, please. Hiashi is classier than that. He just used his prestige to ruin their family and lead the kid's parents into getting divorced. <br><br>Gotta be ninja subtle about that shit, yo. Can't play 5000 hours on Crusader Kings 2 without picking up some subtlety</br></br></br>  <br>Giorno had a dream and he is gay</br>  <br>It's a cheesy romance film for kids with DBZ action. Were you expecting the orange road or something?<br>Also he has shown attraction to women before in the chapter Jiraiya was introduced.</br></br>  <br> &gt;Naruto's feelings for Hinata being a literal deux ex machina <br><br>His feelings for her were all him, nothing forced those feelings into him, he just saw a dream that made him reconsider some things, he just needed to understand first that she loved him, before he started to realize "Oh, I guess I'm into her as well now that I think about it".<br><br>Probably could have figured out another way to do that if that was all it needed, but this way was more flashy and good for the movie in terms of visuals. Also considering what it took for him to realize it, they needed something like this to really hammer it in since he misses the clues so much.<br><br>Guy is dense</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Naruto can be pretty gay sometimes, but let's not forget that he's a serial peeping tom. He's not asexual.</br>  <br>Yeah, I felt that Naruto falling in love with Hinata was BS. Should have been done better. I was laughing the entire time when watching the movie cause of how bad that was.</br>  <br>  7th Hokage and the Scarlet Spring <br><br>that fucking title still makes zero sense to me. and naruto was only a supporting character.<br>for a story about worst family with potential best daughteru</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Perfect. I'll download it as soon as I get back home. Thanks anon.</br></br></br></br>  When is naruto going to take control of other countries ? What´s taking him so long ? He can literally start in morning and be done at evening for some Hyuga fucking.  <br>No problem anon, have fun.</br>  <br>"Where Sasuke stuck his dick into?" doesn't make for a good title.<br><br>Besides, it needed to be something ambiguous so WSJ could advertise it as the adventures of Naruto and Naruto Jr.</br></br></br>  <br><br>People in real life are freaked by their eye design. It must be worse in-universe.<br><br>Also, because even if a dissapointment to Hiashi, Hinata was still treated like a noble, and that probably made the bullies angry (the same version of that scene in the anime implies the kids believed she felt superior to them and looked down upon non Hyuugas).</br></br></br></br>  <br>How the fuck?!</br>  <br><br>Notice he was dreaming about Hinata before the dreams connected.<br><br>He already had feelings for her. But did not underatand the romantic implications until he saw those moments through Hinata's eyes.</br></br></br></br>  I want Hinata to be my  onee-san   <br>The guy constantly asked Sakura out on dates as a 12 year old. Was it that hard to do the same thing with Hinata?</br>  <br> naruto has tapped that AT LEAST twice </br>  <br>Its talked about in the movie a bit; he liked Sakura because she liked Sasuke, and he didn't want to lose to him in a sense.<br><br>With Hinata, he was dense so he confused what kind of like or love it was, didn't really understand the difference due to a misunderstanding, and didn't realize his own feelings.<br><br>Shikamaru Gaiden apparently says they hung out a lot even before the movie in the off moments.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>true, the same way we know they've kissed for at least 12 seconds<br><br> inb4 muh forehead poking is better </br></br></br>  <br> unrequited <br><br>They are already singing duets together.</br></br></br>  <br> Its talked about in the movie a bit; he liked Sakura because she liked Sasuke, and he didn't want to lose to him in a sense. <br><br>That still doesn't make sense, nearly all girls in ninja school liked Sasuke.</br></br></br>  <br>Only ones that "seriously" liked him were Ino and Sakura.<br><br>The other ones were more fangirls, like what Naruto had when he became famous.</br></br></br>  <br>what the fuck in hiashi doing with all his free time then?<br>  bored as fuck, just waiting for keikaku 2.0 kids to age up <br>  considering lobbying naruto to lower legal marriage age in konoha before he realizes what's up </br></br></br>   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Pm<wbr>zwOZq878w</wbr>  [ ] <br>The fuck did this nigga just throw?</br>  <br>Why is he such an Uzumaki fangirl trying to make them the strongest clan in history?</br>  <br>looks strongly like a lightning raseshurikan</br>  <br>Yeah, but look at the size of it.</br>  How is Burrito going to surpass his dad?

The question is, how can that surpass what his dad has: the entire Kurama (or just one half, who knows) inside? Also consider that said dad also happens to be an Asura reincarnation.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How do you out-think someone who can kill you with one touch ? This isn´t Temari vs Shikamaru toddler level. I swear it´s going to be biggest asspull.</br>  <br>It's possible, but it seems too vanilla to have nardo be involved. It's just a giant fucking Rasengan.</br>  <br>So either he gets beat by a half sandnigger or he needs training from the two ninja Gods to defeat him?</br>  <br>Holy shit muh dick.</br>  <br> But probably that's Dadruto's Rasengan and Bert is helping him throwing it because Father-Son kamehameha shit <br>I dunno. The way it rotates when Bort gets ready to use it makes me believe it only has a single user. But you could be right. Or he could have just made it for him and handed it off.</br></br>  <br>Sauce just teaches chidori and supervises. Naruto just taught him the clone jutsu. Bolt is actually too lazy to actually train most of the time.</br>  <br>maybe it just looks bigger cause bolt is still a kid when naruto learned rasenshurikan when he was older and taller.</br>  <br>So it's canon? Jiraya and Neji reincarnated inside of Bort?</br>  <br> 12 years away <br> comes back just to train Boruto <br><br>Kek.</br></br></br></br>  <br>shikamaru had to be sneaky since he was fighting someone who had a perfect long-range defense with moderate offense at all ranges.<br><br>burrito probably doesn't have any viable long range attacks before sauce later trains him.<br><br>but realistically, shikadai would stand little chance against a shadow clone user with death touch unless he picked up a LOT of techs from his mom or multi-target grab already from his dad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Boruto is lazy when it comes to training according to the profile. I suspect rather than train, he just picks things up.</br>  <br>forehead poking is objectively retarded and therefore reserved for shit characters like sasuke and sakura</br>  <br> dat bear mode Chouji w/beard. </br>  <br>He must have taught him something really impressive if he ends up wearing Sauce's headband in the final fight.</br>  <br> What's to stop me from becoming a god 'ttebasa? </br>  <br>Is it just me or does the movie look kind of bad? I mean, this is movie quality animation? The animation seems like it's from an average series, and the characters look like they're really off-model sometimes.</br>  Miia.

You're late.</br>  Rachnees Swimsuit - Cereas Swim Suit - Suus Suut  So what is Octopussy's secret intentions, /a/?  So Suu is getting smarter as time goes on, right? How long until shes the smartest person in the house?  <br>Either Mero's childhood friend. A while back Mero told her about her tragedy fantasies and now she's here to help her fulfill it or something<br><br>Most likely though just something similar to Miia, Scylla needs Mero for lewds/something else and she dislikes humans not just males.</br></br></br>  <br>What else? To get Darling for herself.</br>  Holy jesus Rachnera confirmed for best girl. <br> Even though she's always been that. </br>  <br>I am very ready for the best girl</br>  <br>Said no one ever.</br>  <br>I did, so silence fool.</br>  <br>I bet all her outfits are homemade.</br>  <br>I did.</br>  based<br><br>crab<br><br>man</br></br></br></br>  <br> best girl <br> but I'm disgusted by spiders </br></br>  who else is fucking hype for HAND PUSSY  <br> that cute expression of happiness when Darling asks her to catch more stingrays <br>It's nice to see her show real affection once in awhile.</br></br>  Reminder:<br><br>Dead = Bird &gt; Slime &gt; Snek &gt; Fish &gt; Spidey = Horse</br></br>  <br> disgusted <br><br>Why? Most people say afraid. They're not very disgusting. They're adorable or lovely most of the time, incredibly clean, and very very helpful to us as a species.</br></br></br>  <br>I know that feel, I'm the same way but with Miia/snakes</br>  <br>Agreed! Rachnee showing happiness and affection like that was just lovely! I want my own spiderwife, damnit!</br>  <br>Disgusted? No.<br>Afraid? Kinda agree there<br>But anon, just think about that sexy body and her  qt personality  and you'll ignore the spider parts pretty quickly.</br></br></br>    Best part of the chapter was Darling getting excited about helping with the cooking. I don't remember ever seeing him enjoying himself that much before. It really felt like we saw more personality from him than we have before.  <br><br>She's my current favorite. I'm gonna keep an eye out for the mermaid, though.</br></br>  <br><br>Rachnera a cute!<br><br>Cute!!!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh we know anon.</br>  <br>Because... I do, I guess? The spiders where I live are not in any way dangerous, the worst they can do is build webs at face height, there's very little to be afraid of. On the other hand I find the way they move to be creepy, the way they look to be creepy, the way they eat to be creepy, and so on. Pretty disgusting.</br>  So... is Octopussy going to be a Bond-type villain or will this be some kind of Little Mermaid/Disney story where Mero is offered to grow legs?<br><br>I don't know, I'm just hoping there's going to be something about this kidnapping that gives Mero some char. development.</br></br>  <br>TOp Kek</br>  <br>Im leaning towards what some people have said that it'll end up being someone Mero knows trying to give her some tragedy that she loves so much. Her being offered legs would be interesting though, I could see her agreeing to it so she doesn't have to stay at home, only to have Darling save her and give a speech about being yourself.</br>  Daily dose.  <br>I want to stare at Rachnee's eyes until she blushes and yell at me to stop.</br>  <br>Don't we all?</br>  <br><br>hopefully something similar to this</br></br>  <br>That reminds me, none of the girls have ever actually made darling cum, right? I'm surprised he's held back considering the situations he's always in.</br>  You will never fuck a lamia while she tickles your prostate with her tail. You will never feel her long wet tongue wrap around your pusling cock. You will never orgasm while being strangled around the neck. You will never thrust into her tail; it coiled into a scaly onahole. You will never suck on a lamia's tail while fucking her throat, holding her head by her ears; her tongue wrapped around your balls. You will never press your member between a lamia's tits along with her tail, frotting and titfucking them both. You will never cuddle with her in the sunlight, warming her cold body with your own.  Poor murderfish got cheated out of a double kill by Suu arbitrarily running out.  <br>I want to look into her eyes until they start shining like small rubies.</br>  <br> Mero causes Suu's death <br> Darling and other girls forever pissed at her <br> She's forced to live at home <br>I wonder if that would be too much tragedy for her fetish.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It would've been a double, Rachnee can't survive submersion either.</br>  Ramsey-Darling was fun  <br> 19372▶ <br> Reminder: <br> Dead = Bird &gt; Slime &gt; Snek &gt; Fish &gt; Spidey = Horse <br>Never has someone's opinion ever been so, so wrong.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Never has someone's opinion ever been so, so right. <br><br>Fixed for accuracy</br></br></br>  <br>I wish the girls would have noticed how much happier he was right then compared to when they drag him into shenanigans.

All the girls seem to want vaginal sex from Darling before anything else. Though considering the gifts most of them have... they could do things for him no normal human woman could do.</br>  <br>Well, her blue skin is very shocking, she's the only one who impressed me most when her colors were showed</br>  <br>Spiders have their anus at the end of their lower abdomen, while their vagina is where rachne's human one would be. So she would have 1.

Im confused.</br>  <br>Doing chuuni dullahan stuff</br>  <br>She has a dettachable head anon, not a removable penis</br>  <br>Think over how that would work.</br>  <br>With what would she shoot a load in her vagoo? Does she just like buy, a nerf gun or something.</br>  <br> voice of Sento saying silly chuuni stuff <br> not moaning voice of her </br></br>  So adorable.  <br>Have to admit that I'm liking a lot of the anime faces. Reminds me of when I first got into the early chapters.</br>  <br>I'm surprised that none of them have thought of that. He's so sexually repressed he'd probably fall in love with whichever girl finally relieved him first.</br>    <br>I think Lala is one of the cutest girls but her lack of character just makes her less appealing compared to the other girls.</br>  <br> not posting the others </br>  <br>Exactly what Smith is waiting for. Succubus that she is.</br>  <br>The bottom left panel made me laugh, that was one of my first thoughts when ch 34 came out.</br>  <br>The dryad, damn that's going to be fun.. When the blu-rays come out </br>  <br>Fuck all the body holes while the head watches from the shelf?</br>    Will O go after Darling's D?  <br> Draco is a blonde <br><br>...Huh.

Meeting the parents would still be funny.</br>  <br>If i hadn't just re-watched the Blob, I would agree. But on a normal day, Suu is literally best girl</br>  Hopefully there's a Suu and Papi threesome doujin.  <br><br>What exactly does darling do? Was it ever mentioned in the manga? If so, I forgot. He doesn't seem to be a student or have a job or do any sort of work. Yet lives alone somehow. Is he a rich NEET?</br></br>  <br>I really want this to happen soon. I hope since Darling is so plain they are really crazy to contrast, and excited about him finally having girls around. It would be fun if they tried to quiz the girls and pick which one they like the best for him.</br>  PAPI<br>A <br>CUTE</br></br>  <br>I think he still lives in his parents house, but they are working abroad, so he supports himself there.<br><br>It would be hilarious if they returned during the Mero arc, like, they get home without him being there and have no idea what happened to the house.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought he used to live with his parents but they were working abroad when Miia was dropped off. I don't think they've ever mentioned him working but it seems like he has some experience working even if he doesn't currently have a job.</br>  I hope we get some lewd Cerea/Rach shorts.  <br>I have to imaging that she slid her swimsuit top over her chest, or somehow managed to squeeze her wings enough to get it to go down</br>  <br> It would be hilarious if they returned during the Mero arc <br>I could get into that. <br><br> They get home <br> Note on the table from his parents <br> They returned home, met Smith and then left without thinking anything was wrong <br> &gt;They mention that Smith is nice and he should marry her </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the comic mentioned him working a part time job.</br>  <br><br>LITERALLY PERFECT</br></br>  <br> lilith <br>I can't fucking wait</br></br>  http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/14376<wbr>57745</wbr>  <br>Cerea's swimsuit is nice.</br>  <br><br>He makes note that he might struggle with money, but he does have some off-screen job.

Took me a minute.</br>    <br>I want to see Rach get stuck in her own Web somehow and I want to see a smug Cerea say "oh how do you get stuck in your own web" diamonds</br>  <br>So, a catdog situation?</br>  Has it ever been covered how Darling is so incredibly fucking strong? He brings himself back from the brink of death, he takes wounds that would be fatal to normal humans, and he laughs it off. There is no way Darling is fully human  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tZW<wbr>LpxTfnB8</wbr>  [ ]</br>   we will never get a goat girl <br> even though her basic bodytype is already taken by Cerea </br>  <br>Quads Witnessed</br>  <br> tfw his punches launch people a few meters into the air </br>  <br> forgetting he has anti-spiral powers </br>  <br> I have a feeling he gets funded from the agency after having to deal with 6 girls at once. <br><br>He does, but it came off as a surprise to him, since he was feeding the girls on his own money.</br></br></br>  <br>the fuck is that coming from?</br>  <br> http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/1437<wbr>657745</wbr> <br><br>Cerea's so cute. <br><br> What the hell am I saying all girls are cute as fuck.  </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They could go for something more like a satyr.

Except not facing different directions.</br>  <br> succes </br>  <br> Darling's father is Odin or Zeus </br>  <br> everyone has a mini-suumba of their own </br>  So is magic real in this world?  <br> Darling's aunt is Smith making him a quarter-demon on his mother's side and she wants to spend time with her adorable nephew and give him lots of cute monster girls for a harem <br> She also wants his virginity. </br></br>  <br>No evidence of that is currently present, but Lala is definitely supernatural. Time will tell. Oct might be a Sea Witch.</br>    <br>No</br>  <br>Yeah it kinda stretches the believability a bit (not that the setting itself is particularly believable but its distracting). He should just make an argument to Smith that he should be allowed to sleep with them to help with choosing a wife.</br>  Now, considering that snek is already confirmed as the worst girl by the author, who is the second worst girl?  <br>Nah, its all part of Smith's diabolical plan to edge him for ages then claim his energy/virginity all in one go in a gigantic orgasm on the day of the group wedding to the girls.</br>  <br>Depends on what your definition of magic, but I think it probably does. Between Suu, Lala, Kii, Doppel and the kitsune chick from a few chapters ago, I think theres definitely something magical.</br>  Hey, what happened to the archive? <br><br>https://archive.moe/a/</br></br>  <br>I can't help but imagine that he'll give in to one of them before long, and marry that one afterwards.</br>  <br>Do you not know what a 503 error is?</br>  <br>Well thats all fine, I just meant that it's hard to believe he has the willpower to resist considering the situations he's constantly in and the fact that hes still a virgin who's never had a girlfriend before all this. Speaking of, I can't remember them ever mentioning his age, have they yet?</br>  <br>It's because Darling is actually a  homosexual. </br>    <br>The amount of blood ejected from his nose says otherwise</br>  <br>Yes that is true. But Cerea is the qtest.</br>    <br>I have a nosebleed problem too, and it's not caused by sexy monstergirls lusting for my penis.</br>  <br>If it weren't a manga it probably would have happened by now. Definitely the most likely scenario realistically but I doubt they would end the series by default like that. Would it be a harem end if they group raped him in an orgy?</br>  <br>He was on the verge of having  loving, consensual  sex with Miia, and he didn't put up any kind of fight when Rachnee had him on his back. I'm pretty sure Darling isn't a homo.<br> Wouldn't that be a giant kick in the ass, though. </br></br>  <br>He's the main character in a harem anime, that on itself takes a special kind of man, one that can take the punishment from the genky, the childhood friend, the tonboy, the tsundere and the whole harem when he walks into them changing, or falls into them. But even the standart harem MC houldnt survive the abuse of monstergirls with super human strenght, so they built Darling, and they built him to last, wich on itself is necesary but instead of keeping it as a manga inside joke "lol he survived it because he's MC", crabman breaks the forth wall a little and says "no, he has un-natural resistance", and he used that to explain why Lala joined the harem, because she caught interest in him.</br>    <br>Impossible. He's always looking at girl's bodies and getting flustered, remember him shearing the sheep girl?</br>  <br> Next full moon comes around, and Darling forgets to lock the door </br>  <br> lol made you look, nerd </br>   next chapter features scyla witch <br>are your bodies ready?</br>  <br>Cerea is cute! CUTE!</br>  <br> Wakes up already mid sex with one of them <br>Would Darling take responsibility or dive full on into depravity?</br></br>   people liking cerea now <br>yay!</br>  <br> Would Darling take responsibility or dive full on into depravity? <br>He'd go full ahegao. By the sunrise he'd look like a raisin due to all his manjuices being drained during the night's escapades.</br></br>  <br>He'd take responsibility. He'd also take responsibility the next week after the rest of them raped him in his sleep.</br>  <br>I'm sure at that point, all bets are off. If he's already balls deep, he might as well enjoy it.</br>  <br>Suu = goo.</br>  I want to ride Cereas mom.<br><br>Cerea might take care not to hurt her Master when in bed. Cereas mom would break you and make you want more.</br></br>  <br>It finally happened.

It's been said that what she's doing is downright chaste compared to how other lamia's act</br>  <br>Neither is Mero.</br>  <br><br>Gentlemen of excellent taste. Would want beside me as we ride our centaurfus into battle.</br></br>  <br>She just loves her darling and wants to keep him to herself. Though I would not object to a lamia harem in the least.</br>  <br>Darling may have superhuman strength and resilience, but I don't' know if he could survive that.</br>  When?  <br>Her love for Darling is too pure to drug and/or rape him.</br>  <br>Gotta take that protein in somehow</br>  <br>It's funny, even though Lamia society regularly works based on harems, Miia would probably be the least open to a harem ending for the series.</br>  When are we getting a moth-girl to out-yandere murderfish?  <br>But she tried exactly that when her mother came by.</br>  <br>we shokugeki now</br>  <br>I would have done the same</br>  <br>That was just her mother being a bad influence.</br>  <br>Technically,, she didn't do it or condone it.

It's pretty obvious Yukimura intends to expand upon the dialogue between Thorfinn and Hild that he hinted several chapters ago.</br>  <br>Pic related. She wants Thorfinn to remember something he said to her, which is what's being explained through this flashback.

The all the Crimson girls except Yomi got at least one shitty figure, not counting the niitengo.</br>  <br>I've been looking for that Miku cover for a long time. Fearing I may have to settle for a bootleg. Either way, nice taste.</br>  <br>Maybe you should put some effort into it.</br>  <br>She'll get an Alter figure in my heart. This is foolproof.</br>  <br> no pubes </br>   Megaman Nendoroid <br><br>I'm buying 2.</br></br>  <br><br>Forgot pic.</br></br>  I don't know about you but I prefer my figures with broken spines.    is it wonfes yet    <br>Hope we get a Roll and Proto Man out of this as well.</br>  <br>My favorite is so unpopular even my heart can't even imagine a scale of her being made. It'd be too painful.</br>  <br>Soon. What are you looking forward to?</br>    <br>Is it Murakumo?</br>    <br><br><br>I honestly don't know why people are against her face, it looks fucking exactly like Tama, not only like in the art she's based from but also on the anime she makes that expression all the time.</br></br></br>  <br>sorry I don't have a needle dick like you</br>  <br>I'd feel less despair if it were.  __Imu__ </br>  <br>a figure from a show i liked in the past that never got squat<br>like witch craft works or amagi brilliant park<br><br>i am braced for disappointment and also boats</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can hardly believe anyone likes her.</br>  This is probably the only real chance to get a figure for a favorite character of mine, but really don´t know if I should get it.<br>It´s....too lewd.</br>  <br>I agree, the other figure is so much better.</br>  <br>That's what multiple dicks are for dumbass. Guess you got all defensive and forgot about the topic?</br>  <br>I'd be happy with just 2 large throbbing members, so I can anal and vaginal at the same time</br>  soon  <br>buy the alter one.</br>  <br> Lewd Gochuusagis <br>How dare they do this to my daughteru</br></br>  need to see that Starry Miku from RoB, I really hope we get to see a sculpt atleast  Is smug loli in stock anywhere or am I fucked? I couldn't decide which ver I wanted and when I finally did it was too late. Willing to go proxy if need be.  <br>Also soon, would prefer a scale but at least it's something for best CV</br>  <br>Child bearing hips</br>  Still hoping. <br><br><br>No, but SOON.</br></br></br>  <br>Buyfags don't play games or watch anime. Note they only buy lewd figures of OCs and flavor of the month like Hestia. If it's not meant to be hotglued, it's shit. Half the people posting Tama don't know where she's from.</br>  <br>pretty much.</br>  Up.  <br><br>I was going to call this shitpost, but with the amount of<br><br> face looks off <br> it looks weird <br><br>And the likes a lot of figures get here it makes you wonder if most of them even know the source of said figures.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Figma Kirishikuma <br><br>Likely a figma Haruna or Takao or Kongou to follow?</br></br>  <br>Precisely why I don't dare to dream for her to get any figures ever. She doesn't even get New Wave cards.</br>  <br>Just yesterday people were rapidly posting about slutty Illya and Kuro and asking about the source material. Only reason people want them is because naked loli. They weren't even upset they added bikinis to them when the source image had them nude because they don't know of it.</br>  <br><br>Face is good otherwise but that mouth is horrifying. I wish they'd have given her teeth.</br></br>  I hope GSC final does a CCS figure, figma are nice, but I need a scale. <br><br>Also, will they ever deliver those figures from that 2012 poll? I need Billy re-release and figma Gil. <br><br><br>Sounds about right.</br></br></br></br></br>  It's like you guys don't even know it's norm/a/l in here now.  How likely this one is a Knights of Sidonia character sitting on top of Tsumugi?   ¥22,240 in Solajewris <br> ¥16,000 in amazon japan <br><br>How is this allowed?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm genuinely surprised by the amount of buyfags that can't recognise the source. Even if you haven't seen it, simply browsing this shithole should familiarise you with 90% of figures posted here. I mean fuck, how do you post on /a/ and not be able to recognise fucking Illya?</br>  <br>shut the fuck up.</br>  <br>I thought most fans knew she was a huge fucking slut. Didn't you pick up on the subtext?</br>  <br>Because they don't. That or they're genuinely stupid, which wouldn't surprise me.</br>  <br>sauce?</br>  <br/>  <br>It's great that we're getting the Chino nendo, but i hope the Alice nendo is also displayed</br>  <br>The bikinis actually made me decide not to pre-order. But yeah, it astounds me how many people here either don't know where things are from or are too fucking retarded to just look it up on Google.</br>  <br>That's not even the problem. The face does look like in the illustration, but open mouth and those eyes just don't look good in 3D.</br>  <br>That I was: a man with anime as a main entertainment source, with own opinion on the best show/score/girl of the season, with something to look forward during work week<br>That I am now:<br> what a nice figure, maybe I should watch or read that to justify buying <br>Gross consumerism shrine.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>I like, and I usually hate that kind of expressions on most figures, but in this particular case all that does is scream "TAMA BATTORU" whenever I see it. <br><br>Even from the Nendo only the expression of pic gave me the same feeling. <br>I'll wait till after Wonfest to pre-order though, 22800Y is not cheap and since it's almost a year away I want to see what else is likely going to be released around that time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't even browse /a/ that much outside of buyfag and haven't seen many series in the last few years and even I can recognize most of what gets posted here. It's not even hard.</br>  <br>too bad she doesn't look much like the illustration</br>  <br>Blue and the other protags never.</br>  <br><br>I can't tell which one of those looks worse. Both look like dudes at least. <br>Do people actually think this looks good?</br></br></br>  <br>Her legs and body angle make no sense in the illustration.</br>  <br>The figure looks better.</br>  <br>I like how she looks in the figure.</br>  <br>yes<br><br>i wouldn't buy, as i dont care fore DC/Marvel - but i find this one looks beautyful</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm gonna say the figure looks better. Her pose is more natural and she doesn't look undead.</br></br>  <br>You too slow</br>  Annie best shingeki  <br>EMA are supposed to be in their twenties in the film.<br><br>Thank you for translating.</br></br></br>  <br> is there anything that'd make up for it? <br>SHARE YOUR FUCKING ANNIE FOLDER ALREADY</br></br>  http://myanimelist.net/featured/64<br><br>Machiyama's thoughts on the film. A lot of it is stuff we've known before, but it's interesting.</br></br>  <br>Thanks, I wasn't too sure about their ages and the kanji itself read adolescence so I just left it like that even though it seems weird.<br><br><br>I'm surprised someone took the time and effort to fully transcribe it. I thought the reason they gave for not having Levi and Erwin as names was weak, couldn't they have just made up something like they were half gaijin so they had gaijin names and not be so autistic? But then again they are supposed to appear in the next live action right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure it would be full of duplicates you already have.<br><br>I heard that they were supposed to be mentioned. I hope they don't show up.</br></br></br>  Whose watching this just for the trap? And whose watching for the 'mystery'?
