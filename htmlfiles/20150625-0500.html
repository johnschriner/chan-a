[ Dumping Historie c90 and Vinland Saga c117 raws. Might post something else alongside them, still looking through the issue.  http://www.mediafire.com/folder/4tq<wbr>gm1g0a2qvy</wbr>      NEW HISTORIE? FUCKING FINALLY     Get yo ass moving, we've been waiting way too many months.    On it right now.        27 WHOLE PAGES FOR A HISTORIE CHAPTER. THANK GOD.        28 pages of Historie  That's 28 pages of Sangokushi you could be translating      Hox, what do you think about Ad Astra?     Best anime to watch high?   Naruto    Non Non Biyori   Yama no Susume.  I think the better question would be, does there exist an anime, that would actually be worst, if you watched it drunk or high?  dude weed  K-On!   from Ishibumi's blog  The BD's for S3 will be coming with a 6-part novel called "Highschool DxD EX"  We don't know how it fits into the timeline, but this may be a preview at the sequel to the series.   God from another world   4th user of Durandal   Black haired boy that uses lightning   RED HAIRED BOY WITH DRAGON AURA   Brown haired Angel with Dragon wings   Asia-kaasan   In xx years from now, a big war will occur.   The title:  High School DxD EX -- Crimson-haired Sekiryuutei --   Issei confirmed dead after knocking up the girls?                   Issei dies   Saji becomes MC   How would /a/ feel?      Heads up.  Ishibumi was inspired to do this because of Naruto Gaiden.    Shit series, don't care.  Eh, probably a "what-if" alternate universe plotline   From what I read on the blog, it sounds like some time machine Azazel created.    It's most likely a teaser for a sequel after DxD ends. That's pretty fucking hype.  Info I gathered from the quotes I could understand:   Azazel says this is the telling of the forbidden story.   In xx years from now, a big war will occur. Some of those who have been imprisoned achieved a revival. - Mysterious boy with black hair that uses lightning   Red haired SWORDSMAN boy with dragon aura    Issei confirmed dead after knocking up the girls?  One of the quotes is from him, so no.  Hopefully Code-Zero'll get on translating this pretty soon.               Ophis better be in it or else my interest will fade quickly.    Issei confirmed dead after knocking up the girls?  good isseis hair fucks me off   So, what happened to the side stories being adapted to anime form? Was that a troll?   They're coming in each Dx vol it sounds like. Riser ova coming in December with Dx.2    The OVA "Unresurrected Phoenix" is with Dx2.  This 6-part Novel is with the BD/DVD Volumes.  Each season there is a 6-part Novel included with the CDs.  I don't know what Season 1's is.   Season 2 is about Issei having a date with every member (yes, including Gasper and Kiba) of the ORC in a single day            Red haired SWORDSMAN boy with dragon aura  Kiba is the father      Kuroka and Koneko also confirmed to have Issei's kids    DX.2 isn't out until December anon, it's not a troll.       It sounds like Issei is having Kiba train the kid.    nah Kiba must have sneaked in the night and took a bite at buchou     Kiba wanting anyone over Issei     The kids came from the future.  He most likely is already dead at that timeline. The title is Crimson-haired SEKIRYUUTEI after all.      MC dead his wives still alive and will still be alive for all eternity sucks to be him. They'd eventually move on and find another man.  Top kek ishibumi       The title is Crimson-haired SEKIRYUUTEI after all.   That's true. But it doesn't seem like these kids are fully grown, and I doubt it would take Issei anywhere near 10,000 years to have a child with any of the girls (and there's no way someone actually managed to kill him). And again, one of the quotes is his.  For all we know Crimson Sekiryuutei hints at the volume 20 preview thing with Rias.        Shiva can probably kill Issei, even years into the future. Remember that this fucker is Dragon Ball levels of OP.    But what kind of a fucking ending would that be?   Promises happy ending for all the girls   Fuck it, let's kill off MC-kun as soon as he gets them all pregnant    Although it would confirm that he gets laid before the story ends          God from another world   Issei stops being the Sekiryuutei   Becomes the Chichigami   Chichigami was him all along from the future      ALTERNATE TIMELINE   wonder the backlash from the nips would be like.    I'd love it if they pulled something like this.   I'd like it just because of how much a little shit Issei was for the longest fucking time.       This would be fun.   Kumiko did end up being a gold mine for reactions didn't she?      And I love every single one of them.   A couple of volumes later for sure! Any time now!   season 3 sucks   gives this as an incentive to buy the BD's  Ishibumi had this planned out from the start.     Issei is dead   All these big shots talking about how much of a perverted badass he was and telling tons of absurd stories to his many, many children  mite b cool    How do u watch it uncensored, FFF is 2 episodes behind?    while his previous wives are still alive and finally moved on with their new man   Ishibumi make it happen       yfw the "new men" are Issei clones     but he's still dead Jim     Shitty season 3   Shitty ending on last volume   Yeah DxD confirmed for shit.        Implying Issei can actually die     The side story where Azazel made 100 clones did happen you know. We all know for a fact that the girls won't move on. Maybe in doujins, but not in this series.   Where do u watch uncensored, FFF is really behind.   There's a new Seikiryuutei anon. He's dead   We all know for a fact that the girls won't move on.  give it 5,000 years and they'll eventually encounter a person who has similarities with Issei. And said person will eventually win them over and make them happy. Why would you want the girls to live miserably without a man in their life, it's Issei's fault he died       I mean, Issei might just fucking transcend being the Sekiryuutei and is just in the Dimensional Gap all day doing stunts with Great Red.    but it was explained that in order to get a new host previous host must die first    That's not for every Sacred Gear actually. Walburga's found a new host without her dying.   Kinda like what Strike The Blood did. There the MC's daughter went to the past and got a chance to meet him when he was young. Sounds cool.   You're looking at this as if Issei wasn't going to share his Sekiryuutei power with a certain crimson-haired girl in the next volume.   give it 5,000 years and they'll eventually encounter a person who has similarities with Issei. And said person will eventually win them over and make them happy.   Maybe in doujins, but you underestimate their love for Issei. Why would they want anyone else? They were ready to give up on life in v12 and their connection has only grown closer now.   Why would you want the girls to live miserably without a man in their life,    Implying you need a man to be happy when you're surrounded by friends from your counter-terrorist team    it's Issei's fault he died   He's the motherfucking child of the two strongest beings in the world, allies with all of the strongest beings not named Shiva, and has the potential to be the strongest being in existence. He's not gonna die anon. Not even Shiva could handle Dulio + Crom + Vali + Issei + Saji + Sun Wukong + Cao Cao + others.                Issei is dead, UNLESS we change the past to change their future!   Come with me if you want to live     kek There's a new Sekiryuutei previous host died stop being delusional.   Maybe in doujins, but you underestimate their love for Issei. Why would they want anyone else?  because they have yet to find someone who will heal them and save them from their loneliness. Just face it anon they'll move on one way or another and they'll meet a person that reminds them of Issei and hooks up with him and they'll live happily with their new family        Not even Shiva could   How do you know? Hindy mythology is fucking broken.      You know damn well he'll be alive somehow.    yes because this is probably just some Strike the blood ex they're from the future BS and they'll warn them or sumshit to prevent Issei from dying   Dawn of The Final Day 9 Hours Remain   wkwk  Will Gainax deliver?  I'm scared. I don't want it to end.    No opening   Insert of full version of Stella-rium when Subaru starts to fix everything   You heard it here first folks. My dead finacee worked at GAINAX       finacee      I don't want this ride to end either    Hva you bought strawberry milk for the last episode, /a/?  Please let them remain together in their universe even after the alien and their powers have gone, Gainax!   Like I said, I'm lactose intolerant.     3 hours left     You mean 6. 7,5 until HS.   Hopefully we will get another kissu.   one episode left     KinMoza and SB69 are over   Pleiades to end soon   Etotama and DanMachi will follow too  It it not an end. Just a transformation.        DanMachi will follow  It's not all bad news then.     Danmachi was good.    Good for what it is perhaps, but that's not saying much.    It really wasn't.    Danmachi is just a LN advertisement. The booty in it was good though.    Hestia could only keep me going for four episodes before I dropped it.    Good.  So i can marathon the shit out of this in the mid-seasons week of nothingness.       not being white    Both excited to see how it ends, and sad that it's ending. Somehow this series felt like Gainax really put a lot of heart into making it.   I can't be the only one doing a marathon rewatch before the finale, right?     1 hour 25 minutes remain    I want Gyate Gyate of the Houkagos.     There's no time. I'm re-watching Aquarion and Symphogear.    Until what? It's 80 minutes left according to anichart, but in previous threads, images start appearing 4 hours from now, and HS is out one hour after that.    So is anichart wrong?    Yeah.    Zettai! I've actually done it throughout the past Week because of Work Schedule.   Nanoko's song is so beautiful. So glad I downloaded the singles for the OP and ED.  Where's the stream? Yucie and Neet are dead for me.    Preview https://<span>youtu.be/QEGqRYax6Lk  [ ]   inb4 ends with Subaru opening a door    a fucking black hole   Minato and Subaru together   I'm getting hype.      So 1 hour or 3 hours till it airs? Can I marathon it in time?    3 hours, but you won't have enough time to marathon in   Dat parallel universes. Dat fountain.   I think anin has enough time as long as he is not planning to watch the livestream and wait for subs instead     The spaceship appeared  So the earth is fucked? Inb4 time travel.     3:30 until it airs, 5 hours until subs. You can make it. Just don't get distracted and don't check the thread.       Okay thanks anons.   Enjoy your finale          You are in a car advert thread.   The OST is out today.  It's a shame the characters look washed out.   Hestia is the worst part of Danmachi and not what makes it good.   Reminder: by buying banana milk you are a filthy Bananaraffe xeno scum and you should be purged.   The animation looked way better in the pilot too. Wish they would have kept some of that fluidity in the show     flavored milk  Straweberyy is meme flavor tbh.      meme flavor  What does it even mean?    Futaba thread?   Ironic shitposting is still shitposting.    Yes    /sp/ pls.   volume 2 cover   The weakest part of this show is definitely the animation and art, which is a pity because it means the limited staff cannot fully portray the vast magnitude and grandiosity of the distances and celestial objects that the characters experience.  For example, while pic related was a great moment in the anime due to timing, dialogue and voice acting, it was just a few simple pans of a plain empty landscape and a starry sky, nothing even close to the level of fascinating alien geography that the concept art shows.  Due to the awful budgeting, this is actually one anime where I'm thankful that the staff chose to use extensive CGI for action cuts. Seeing the (3D) characters fly in dynamic ways with interesting choreography is a great distraction from the stasis and lack of movement in the 2D sequences. Had they chosen to animate solely in 2D for the flight sequences, the tragic lack of budget would have been a lot more egregious.        When was pic related used again?    Leaked art. It was the episode with the supernova.   Subaru is subarashii.  Just a reminder we have 7 contestants. Someone  probably Aoi  will be alone, or third wheel.  Okay /u/, riddle me this. We know why prez looks like a blue titty, but how come girls other than Nanako see him as that?     /u/      /u/     Why don't you fuck off and stay there?      Come on lads, it was a joke to instigate giggles.  So, any ideas why? It would make sense if Subaru made the drawing, or if Nanako is actually the protagonist.        Before Nanako gave him his form he was formless. So after she gave him his form everyone sees him like that? It never said that they all perceived his appearance differently.    Yeah, but how come they all see him the same way. It was kinda implied that everyone sees him their own way.     It could be that the first person to see him gives him his form which everyone sees him as.  It would be weird if everyone saw him differently then how would it work when they squeeze him and stuff?      Is there more?     It could be that the first person to see him gives him his form  He was a shota before he met with Minato, who gave him that form? The alien asked Nanako to give him a form so it is not automatic.       It'll probably be explained this episode who made him into a magical boy -- what I'm saying is get ready for TIME TRAVEL SHENANIGANS    I meant the link where you are getting them from nigga   My theory is that the aliens are actually just future human children in a flux state of possibilities.  I love you guys. I love this show. I dont want it to end.   tfw I will not be able to watch season finale with /a/ because I have to go out with IRL friends  Life is suffering.   GET IN HERE ONLY 5 +60  MINUTES LEFT    Fuck them.   Can't watch until later cause of morning shift, but I'm so hype.  the cutest   Absolutely.    Nah, she is for sex.   http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87  Roundabout ED: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=izF<wbr>qa0i_EwI</wbr>  [ ]     So you watch dubs? Disgusting.      https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=eQ2<wbr>giHSp49A</wbr>  [ ]   I don't get the context of this drawing.  Why is Killer Queen dancing with a ballerina?      Read or Die used to be a big thing back in the past. Anita King especially was loved by all, does /a/ still like RoD?   they certainly loved Readman to most it was their first Magane   though everyone hated RoDtv      The original light novels were fun. The OVA is practically beloved nowadays; The TV series and shoujo spin-off, not so much.  The manga reboot was trash and killed the series.       We don't talk about that 'round here anon.    Anita is my eternal adorable imouto. The OVA, novels and even the TV series will always have a dear place in my heart.    That was Chiwa Saito's breakout role as a Seiyuu, right?    Loved the OVA and TV series, own them both alongside all the manga. Yomiko a best. Nenene a best. Paper Sisters a best.  Chiwa Saito stronk.     Anita and Lavie were the same year.    Anita is great, and a much beloved loli. Her alone makes the TV series better than the OVAs for me. That's not completely true, her relationship with Nenene was needed too.    Also like most Read or Die threads, this thread'll have fifty posts over the course of like three days and slowly die.   Nenene was special.     Indeed.       Part of me wants to say they don't make them like her anymore but that's probably nostalgia talking.   She certainly was different though.  And man her boobs looked huge in her disguised outfit.       I just rewatched the OVA  dub  a couple weeks ago. Still one of my favourite anime. I remember enjoying the TV series too, but I can't recall if that holds up. May decide rewatch that soon, but I always hated what became of Wendy.  I wonder how many people have watched the TV series and the OVA but haven't read the manga. Lotta good information in there and the Read or Dream manga aren't quite the same thing but they're still very nice.    It's more like there's a lot of care in the character design of everybody in the series, because I can remember looking at some of the first drafts and thinking "That looks cliched/trashy as fuck", then they reigned it in back more and more before finding that intangible "Sweet spot".    Pretty sure both Wendy &amp; Joker's character arcs followed what happened in the light novels closely, but it's been forever since I read them.  (Lost my physical copies in a fire.)          It seems like a lot of people checked out of the TV series when Wendy came back like she did.  It's not like it was an unsupported change or anything though.      Their character designs are all great too but I was more talking about her behavior as a character. She had a lot going on and she had the opportunity to have it all fleshed out very well over the course of the series.   I don't appear to have the DVD insert scans saved anywhere. I swear I did.  Those things were too lewd.   And the Junior one was gay as hell.        Which one?    /a/ Thoughts on Overlord?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RuN<wbr>APPcjDr4</wbr>  [ ]     tfw they'll call it a SAO rip-off   Life as Skeletor.   Its 2spooky4me    illustrations showing dark and horrifying setting   actual series is just as metal   wonder if Madhouse will put this series off.      Hopefully some tidbits make their way to West from the next weekend's pre-screening event. Though I doubt we will get another PV since it airs on 7th for real, iirc.   Where were you when Demiurge discovered that Albedo had steel abs?  Well, it'll be a fresh breath of air after all the cutesy trash they air now a days.   I'd rather see her tail or Papa Bones' legs.   I read the web novel and dropped it a few chapters in. It's another self insert RPG manga where the MC gets literally everything handed to him because he's the MC. Pretty fucking bad.  Manga chapter 7 when?   But this series still has lots of pandering and wish fullfilment. Its just presented in a different, more digestible wraping. Doesnt mean it doenst have pandering and wish fullfilment like every other LN under the moon.      Overrated anime of the season alongside Gangsta.  I'll be watching Skeletor's battles but besides that I don't give a shit.     Anime character design problems:  Ainz's spaulders. Albedo doesn't have enough frills. Shalltear's lopsided dress. Aura's lack of whip. Mare's lack of silver necklace. Demiurge's boney face. Cocytus's icebergs. Sebastian's chest and hands.            Gangsta is overrated?  Always seemed like a pretty niche thing only 5 people on /a/ were interested in, me included. Same deal here, only theres a bigger handful of people.      If anything, God Eater will be overrated since the normies are all fangasming over 'MUH UFOTABLE'    Gangsta is pretty hyped outside of /a/. Expect it to be popular.  Also, why is are Overlord sprites never updated on time? Literally takes 2-3 days after reaching 200 new followers or 50 retweets.      Weird, I would expect it to not be popular with all the prostitution and drugs themes in it, but I guess those things atract quite the audience.  People must be expecting it to be like Cowboy Beboop or Black Lagoon. Wonder how censored it will be. And I wonder how many "this is outrageous" and "think of the children" scandals it will bring.        normies  Normalfags, they are called normalfags Jesus Christ.     If anything, I know /a/ will hate it because of the fujoshit boogieman and the fact that the main girl is a literal prostitute.     People must be expecting it to be like Cowboy Beboop or Black Lagoon.  People is stupid, no big surprise here.   I wonder how many "this is outrageous" and "think of the children" scandals it will bring.  Why would you care what this "people" think.        fujoshit boogieman? You talking about the supersoldier lesbian couple? Cause if anything that will cause a bigger /v/tard-tier uproar, along with katana brainwashed twin sister.  If anything the main girl being a literal prostitute would be refreshing for /a/, but it could go either way since she has a "oh what a useless female" moments in the begining. I rather quite like her character and seeig her develop.   Inevitably whatever this "people" do will get reported here so I do care. I further care because like it or not we are part of this "people".          From what I've seen, the two new shows being hyped are Gangsta and God Eater.  Gangsta is drawing attention precisely because of violence and drugs. God Eater because of Ufotable.  Going by Twitter, they're leading in follows with Gangsta at 13.5K and God Eater at 24.6K.         God Eater is the usual post apocalyptic teens with weapons anime. ANY show with those things are bound to be popular. Post apocalyptic anything is popular even harems.   I'm sure they're expecting it to be Black Lagoon. You also underestimate how edgy normals can be about their anime. I always thought /a/ would be the cesspool of internet anime. Oh no, there's much worse going on out there.       I predict Gangsta will get a psycho-pass-like following, at least at the begining. If they manage to not fuck up the anime it could even become the new Black Lagoon for some people. Though tbh Im still scratching my head at how they are gonna pace things since it doesnt feel like the first arc is even done yet in the manga. Probly anime original ending since theres not enough material for a season 2 or a story arc for a season 1.      WHEN I SAY GANGSTA YOU SAY NIGGA  GANGSTA       Stop.     MC didnt choose to play a lesbian succubus   so much wasted potential      And it's bit sad only some of those can be attributed to the need to simplify so-bin's art so it's actually doable for animators/budget.    /a/ is one of the few places on the english-speaking internet anyone can enter and have a proper discussion about anime without any stupid filters or rules, provided you go to the right thread at the right time. Like most things on 4chan it is a pile of shit-stained straw with the ocasional diamond in it that makes it worth it. Yes, there are much, much worse places out there. Good god there are. May you never have to step foot in them.     More like MC didn't choose the roleplay lesbian succubus dorm master and all the servants were girls of varying ages.  Would have been best world conquest ever.      I honestly wish there was a series about some otaku that got sucked into an rpg world and it turned out he was as much of a worthless piece of shit as he was in real life.  The whole LN concept where this "normal" guy uses his "gaming smarts" to just completely bowl over some game world is just retarded. What's the point? What's the great story here? Them crushing the competition like it's nothing and sucking the tension out of every scene? What vacuous waste of animation money he's gonna impregnate? To see the same tropes get subverted in the same way ad nauseum?  Come on.         If those were underdesigned so that they can be animated properly then I expect decent animation. So far the trailer does not impress on that regard.     I have an argument against that.  When I was watching Log Horizon back then S1 had this animation friendly style. Everything was seamless even when the scenes got QUALITY. Then S2 boasted about how they were going to be true to the light novel art. It didn't translate very well to the silver screen.  It's not a bit sad when you think about it.           Not that anon but I think the fujoshit boogieman he was referring to was this kind of thought process  oh there are two male characters   must BE FUCKING FUJOSHIT TIME TO SPAM THREADS ABOUT IT GUCBSNCJDBF  That kind of nonsense although it will definitely be a free pass for fujoshit works          May you never have to step foot in them.  I regret to admit I participated in some of them in the past. But I've learned my lesson. Even after becoming somewhat of a normalfag this is the only place I'll discuss anime.    it turned out he was as much of a worthless piece of shit as he was in real life.  I know of two series like that, people who are very proud of their depravity. One is Highschool DxD and the other is a manga I forgot the title, but is about this neet named Niito who became a monster hunter when his mom died and he couldn't mooch off of her anymore.            using DEEN for a fair comparison     Theres probably plenty of LNs in which the MC stays worthless but those dont sell to the auduence that is looking for LNs for escapism. They probably gte filed under NTR-like fetishims. Youre looking at an industry that has grown fat from pandering and pandering sells and what sells gets animated so pandering gets animated. Theres probably some really fucking good material out there but you would have to find it first.   We are all a sum of our experiences so theres nothing to regret dude. All that matters is what you take home with you.          Hey if you've got other examples I'm all ears. I'm just saying, being true to the source art doesn't always translate to the big screen well.    Oh that shit.  Everything with more than one non-MC male character gets called fujoshit these days, even Shokugeki no Souma gets called that. Its like nerds are insecure that if their self-insert isnt the only noticeable cock in the neighborhood it will ruin the experience for them or something.      As long as they keep all the macabre humor and humanity is weak and the Nazarick attitude, I'll just shrug it off.  Since those are the major components to the actual tone of the series and the cast being what they're in novels.      The Gangsta manga is shit, dropped it quickly.    True but it could also be a mockup and the scene itself doesn't have that much motion either way. We'll see how bad it is when Ainz plays around in the Arena and the Lemegeton prior to that.    They may need to tone down/cut some aspects of the story to fit the censors/budget/time/pacing/etc. of the show.  Like the twins fighting the fire elemental at the start shit like that can be cut out and replaced with far more budget-firendly things. This is reasonable. I just hope we dont get too many "they changed/cut this tiny thing so it sucks" threads/atittudes.   Heres your reply.           It's strictly in the same genre as black lagoon, jormungand, noir etc  so yeah I'm fine with some gangsta loving      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127106072  Shits pretty common everywhere on the internet, its part of human culture. Its just a matter of dealing with it, or not and moving on.  Even if you point out the double standard most people will wave it off with some lame justification. Better to just shrug, laugh and leave it, though there is a time and place for everything.      Who the hell is writing these summaries for the anime previews?  Most of these literally begin with "The story revolves around", "The manga follows", The story takes place in", "A romantic comedy set in", etc.   Do they not have any creativity?       They are souless anime watchers of course they have had every ounce of creativity sucked dry from them by all the moeblobs and pandering. Just look at what it did to Kentaro Miura the poor bastard.     There probably are plenty, they just didn't sell and no translator has any interest in them.    Another SAO ripoff with MC just another reskin gary stu that gets everything handed to him. Just beceause he looks like a skeleton doesnt mean shit everything is copy pasted from SAO with extra editing to look appealing for the edgy viewers that likes to masturbate to this garbage.    Please, this is clearly a Danmachi ripoff with the MC getting everything handed to him, and everything in the video game is on his boner.    Nah, this is Log Horizon ripoff.    Nah this is a Matrix ripoff      It's clearly a rip-off of Boku no Hack    I'll be going in for Manglobe and maybe they can deliver something good after their previous oddities.    450k views in 2 days. Holy shit      Mar 22  Not Jun 22     This is a Sharknado spinoff.    It's Madoka ripoff.    It's the 'LN Novel Superlong Title For The Sake Of Lazy Synopsis On The Spine/Front Equivalent For Lazy Reader's Allusion To Something He Might Have Liked In Past'.    I freaking wish.    For some reason I think that Overlord might have more international following than moonland alone. The novel has been licensed officially in ch and kr already.   Can't wait to hear Shalltear's geisha voice.  I only hope that Madhouse won't fuck this up too much.    Doubting madhouse     I'm kind of hyped.     Weird, I would expect it to not be popular with all the prostitution and drugs themes in it, but I guess those things atract quite the audience.   More and more normies are starting to get into anime because it's the new hip, cool thing to do. And they only watch the BRUTAL, METAL, DUDEBRO, METAL, HARDCORE, DARK, EDGY, GRIM, BRUTAL, BRUTAL, BRUTAL, DARKASFUCK, GRIM, EDGY, BRUTAL anime such as ATTACK ON TITAN HOLY FUCK IT'S SO FUCKING BRUTAL AND DARK THIS IS JUST LIKE MY WESTERN TV SHOWS ONLY ALOT DARKER IT'S SO FUCKING BRUTAL AND DARK SO GOOOD!      The director and script writer don't really get my hope up but I'll trust the chief animation director, even if he chose to go and do the anime char designs the way we saw on the website.  I wonder where he picked up that Sebastian is old dragon Chris Redfield, with those arms and upper torso of his. Maybe from his class/skill traits of being unarmed, inner/outer whatever energies voodoo.      After what Madhouse and Aniplex script writers did with Onii-sama, I'll be happy enough to see all the despair and magic/skills animated.  And guess who is doing script for Papa Bones? An Aniplex junior that was on the team for Onii-sama.      I still love how 90% of the comments are in english. It's like the japs don't even care.    Ever seen this?     An Aniplex junior that was on the team for Onii-sama  It's all over. Might as well watch Gangsta.     Gantz would be this for Shooters if they just added it was a game they played.     I honestly wish there was a series about some otaku that got sucked into an rpg world and it turned out he was as much of a worthless piece of shit as he was in real life.   Why the hell do you want a MC like that? I agree that overpowered garystue MCs are boring but watching a loser beta protag is worse, watching them just make you rage and facepalm. Instead why not have a MC that start weak and beta but have a decent character developement with up and down in his live.       Is there any Heroes become Demon King stories?   CASUAL: The Series Not an expert, not a scrub. He played the game now and then on his days off. Even learned a few protips from his gamer obsessive brother he keeps recalling. The Brother flashbacks helping him from total destruction, but nothing game breaking. His only benefit are the stats from the game transfered over to his new self, and he upped his Luck skill without knowing what that meant. So while he looks foolish (Charisma was not so blessed) he still gets amazing item drops and escapes. Even if he doesn't know what he gets.  Then discovering there is an OP antagonist in a far off country, slowly making his presence known. His Brother, also was sent to this land.       SAO clone   You can only hope the chief animation director (for his veteran status) took the helm for the series with the VA's that have actually been on the novel work prior to Madhouse &amp; rest.    I suspect Tsuyokute New Saga may become such story.     dual wielding black swordsman!  Nah, the cape is red, that's important.     Danke  Fallen Heroes are my favorite.     New volume spoiler when   So when are we getting next chapter of Lizard Romance? TLers are being slow this month.    this saturday. presumably.   I fucking love it and I am excited for the anime, a shame they will ruin it somehow. In other news, I am hoping for more translations this weekend.  Pretty obvious, isn't it? Was never a fan of time traveling shenanigans but I might put up with it       Lizardbros  getting "it on"  happens in 5th chapter, just before it's time for them to share the fate of Swords of Darkness.    Better get used to it, it's summer time. I know last summer's wait for few LN's got painful as damn. At least we have the anime to use as painkiller.     The whole LN concept where this "normal" guy uses his "gaming smarts" to just completely bowl over some game world is just retarded.   While you bring up a good point, Overlord isn't like that. The MC is kinda OP, but not because of any outstanding personal quality or "gaming smarts". Not that it matters, because the MC being OP doesn't help him with the conflicts the show brings up.      what's this from? google gives me fairy tail    Try searching the author's name   Shalltears is mai waifu. I wait for her.   Is this hentai or just manga drawn by hentai artist?     saha  You tell me anon    /r/ing screencap of notification from Heroes game. You must know that one.   The page just screams hentai, your skill is weak, anon.    And he paranoid as hell and does make bad choices on the preface of it being improper for master to show his underlings that he can err too.     Damn, now I'm ashamed of myself       He's outright incompetent, and makes many mistakes that he tries to fix, but occasionally makes worse.    Well, at least he is kind to his servants.    Isekai Mahou wa Okureteru    Yeah and that's what it makes more amusing, he isn't right but he always tries to act based on for what is the best for his children and Nazarick.  I'm eagerly waiting for how the facts will come back bite him in the ass. For what caused Shalltear to her valkyrie mode since Silian's retreated while she was still in monster form but Nigredo/Albedo/Ainz saw her having already changed her mode. And what happened to the bodies of Dale &amp; Clementine.      And hopefully they can manage to make her little games with the Death Spreading Brigade &amp; Brita some justice. The VA is going to have to earn her wage for once.   How technologically inclined is your waifu? Does she need help using computers? Is she a leading pioneer in her field?   Has your waifu made or repaired anything for you?     She is never seen using computers. I think she may need some assistance in using a computer.  We have a couple of things in common like fighting for our friends.  Yes she definitely does. She is the one who make cake and stuff to eat and she is the lewdest around them.  Oh yea Akeno looks exactly like her mother  I would give her lingerie  She would want me to get settled into a house then have our child  Biggest bust in the series she doesn't care   <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127106709#p127119378">Click here</a> to view the full text.                    Vidya, naps, and the aforementioned pictographs.    kissu and cuddles, and a cup of tea.    somewhere quiet, like a nice forest lodge.          Chihiro's ideal vacation is sort of like Kyoto: Lots of stuff to see and a relaxing area. Distant, yet familiar at the same time.  The Fushimi shrine is also in Kyoto but that has not much to do with it and is likely coincidence    Hello, Aigisfriend! Chihibro is fine, really. I do wish there was a way I could get to know you more, I like getting to know my fellow Personafriends.        She's average at it, she knows how to use her computer/phone, she have no problems with these kind of things.  She made  me happy.    Minor personality traits, we love cute stuff, and both afraid of heights.   She had a few of them. They did a lot of stuff in them, played games, girls talk, she really enjoyed them.   I want to headpat the bassist.    <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127106709#p127119688">Click here</a> to view the full text.                    she is better than that   ITT: Manga you wish had anime      bonnouji   not cute girls, TCG   sadism and suffering     just started re-reading Hinamatsuri. that would make a pretty great anime   Will this do?    hello fellow /m/an   i enjoyed it more that Death Note  Finally Ratman's final chapters were uploaded on Batoto. I would like to see it animated        I don't think I was ready for this.   All this except Tomoya and Kyou dating. Fucking shipperfag, Tomoya will stay loyal to his waifu.      That would've been the case if not for the fact there was a scene that explicitly shows Tomoya finally taking back what he said about regretting Nagisa after Ushio collapsed in the snow and MC fell into an emotional breakdown.  Though, letting your sickly ass daughter walk in the snow is still fucking stupid. I have no idea what possessed MC to make that decision.       I absolutely loved the ending, but my opinion may be biased because I marathoned the secuel in a single night. But I honestly can see an ending like this  working out perfectly. However, all the Illusionary World stuff played an important role throughout the series, so it would be hard to just ignore it at the end.    Only stupid people enjoy a perfect happy ending like that. All the fucking emotional journey that leads Tomoya to be the man he is at the end of the show was for nothing. Shit writing.     It was more of an adaptation failure than a writing failure.   Just finished S1. Why is Hajime so perfect?          she's also the best at everything.  I don't think that's true. She's good at everything but there are people better than her which she observes and motivates said people into doing their best. Both Sugane and Joe seem to be stronger combatants (O. D. is a given), Rui is far better at computers than any of them and Utsuutsu's ability makes invaluable in saving lives but everyone had doubts or was misguided on what to do until they crossed paths with this girl.   She's very open and friendly but that also makes her kind of unreachable in a way. I really can't imagine someone trying to flirt with her.       yfw her tits grew in S2   She jiggles now too.    What is Kumiko saying to Shu1?   Short answer, no.    Anyone have a webmd of natsuki doing that goofy run in the background?    Only main/semi-important characters that I still call by nickname is ribbon.   Amber-chan! Amethyst-chan! Aquamarine-chan! Citrine-chan! Crystal Quartz-chan! Diamond-chan! Emerald-chan! Opal-chan!

The cool kids strike back.   Have a son to play card game with?   GX would have been better if Judai was a girl.   Dammit Kotori. Is this your revenge for not being a good duelist in your show?     I feel like if duel monster spirit becomes real in real life and some of them get married with some anons here, it will be "I can't understand what my husband is saying" comedy show, only that husband is also AIBOOOOOO     Reiji is like Bizarro cool. Everything about him screams nerd that beat up daily.   And then I remember that he could beat the shit out of most people here.      Who's more fluffier Uzuki or Kaede?    Enjoy your nurutu idol   Damn right I will.      Warring Idol Ranking     Ridiculous concept aside, Ayame's actually pretty great       So lewd  I want Miria to sit on my lap      Is there an idol for socially autistic fucks?   Saekano volume 8 is out. I'll be posting summaries and dumping pics. This is my first time doing a summary, so I wasn't really sure what was fine to omit and wasn't, so if you have any questions or anything to add, please do so.   Read the thread.     Megumi by a landslide.     According to Utahafags: Utaha According to Megumifags: Megumi     Utaha is winning according to our trusty nip reader here    Both wants to be together, the problem is Tomoya's retardation (explained before). They are dating but is something between them and isn't public yet (only Eriri knows that, Megumi still in the darkness about that). </blockquote>]
