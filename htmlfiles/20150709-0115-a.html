[ Dokidokivisual says Kinema Citrus is involved with Gochiusa S2.<br><br>Uh... White Fox?

Their SoL is good.</br>  Dokidokivisual stripped yellow background did funny thing to my eyes.  Me on the right with my wife  Kinema Citrus did YYS so it's fine, maybe.<br>I don't know why a studio would drop an anime that gave them good sales though, gochiusa and yryr being done by other people is going to be weird.</br>  <br>White Fox can't into second seasons<br><br>Steins;Gate0 will end up being by another studio too</br></br></br>  <br><br>Me on the left with my wife.</br></br>  <br>YYS is shit</br>  <br>But it's not.</br>  <br>But White Fox needs to redeem themselves after AgK.</br>  <br><br>Good taste.<br><br>YYS was great, even if not as good as GochiUsa.</br></br></br></br>   Kinema Citrus <br>I would consider the studio that did Barakamon to be trustworthy.</br>  <br> Barakamon <br>That tiny hand in the OP, though.</br></br>  Yeah, you just have to say "Yuzu" and the kid will do pretty much anything you want.

His only hope for victory is a surprise Fusion summon.</br>  <br> dick socks </br>  <br>I'm not even sure they could do the tourney, even if they wanted to. Bear in mind that all of the Lancers are supposed to be entering, as well as their pals in Synchro. There's no way to satisfyingly resolve an entire tournament that size.<br><br>My guess is that either Academia invades and starts carding people  like Jean please please , or the Lancers have to emergency port because Standard is being invaded or some such.<br><br>I just don't see way to actually play the entire tournament out, aside from doing a timeskip to the last 8 or something.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Wanting Shun to win even more <br><br>Bird boy needs to get a good loss to Fusion. Not this Sora off-screen shit. Just Dennis motherfucking Mackfield playing him like a damn fiddle then Fusing Xyz monsters to win. <br><br>But that will never happen because Ruri Raptors are more marketable than Entermages.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> inb4 Dennis is a double spy </br>  <br> not triple spy </br>  <br>I hope not. I mean I want Yuuya to be happy as much as the next person who obsesses over him but Jack shouldn't lose his potency within the universe just because new characters show up.<br><br>Wasn't he blown down the stairs by Sora?</br></br></br>  <br> not quadruple spy </br>  <br>Penis is actually rooting for the winners, so, as soon as academia starts losing, he turncloaks.</br>  I'm just catching up on the last 16 episodes now, and I really regret missing all the threads. I'm certainly ENJOYing this new arc, though. Time to stock up on fanart, I guess.<br><br> mfw either Yugo or Yuya will be dimension-ported as a result of the upcoming proximity with Yuzu <br>Please don't make the fruits stay away from each other too long. Please.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't want him to win, it was just a bad joke about how Shun never loses. If anything I want him to be crushed so badly he's left in an even more pathetic state than Sora was after their first duel.</br>  <br>Arc V has a hard on for group duels, they could knock 75% of participants out with another Battle Royale in a few episodes if they wanted</br>  <br>I want him to watch Yuya vs Yuri in the shadows and I want him to see Yuri get blown out and have him just straight up not ever go back to fusion.</br>  Ok, I had enough of this shit. I want you to say to me, why it's not bullshit when I say neither Lavalval Chain, Infinity or Vanity deserves the ban.  <br> See that Yuri I was only PRETENDING to be retarded </br>  <br> fusion requires xyz monsters <br> effect based on the number of materials on the xyz monsters at the time of the summon. </br></br>  <br> Finals of Friendship cup is Yuya vs Yugo, winner gets to vs Jack for title of King. <br> Yuzu is sitting in the stands right next to the ring <br> As Yugo and Yuya are riding along side each other they pass Yuzu, bracelet starts acting up and ports one of them </br></br></br>   Sawatari and Gongenzaka are literally fodders for Shun.   <br> why it's not bullshit when I say neither Lavalval Chain <br>Its a great utility card that helps a ton of decks, but it isnt broken. The only really bad interaction it has is with Clown Blade, and you should hit either of those before you ban this<br><br> Infinity  <br>Would be perfectly fine if only shitty Rank 5 decks could use it. Ptol is the problem card<br><br> Vanity  <br>Probably should be banned yeah</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/dng/ <br><br>Also<br> Chain <br>It's a staple for almsot every deck with R4 access, a plethora of them being casual fun decks, and there is absolutely no reason to ban it because of the meta, since everything using it only has it to have more consistent access to the broken shit that deserves banning and would have more than enough alternatives even with it gone<br> Infinity <br>Ptolemeius is the problem, no need to take away CyDra's alternate win condition<br> Vanity <br>It's fine at 1 and helps keep things in check nicely enough</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dennis is going to make sure that Yuzu isn't around so Yuya can absorb Yugo.</br>  http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>43798</wbr>  <br>After, like, 90% of that duel being offscreen. Bird boy needs to have a full duel with Dennis onscreen. Shun pushes and pushes and just when he thinks he has Dennis on the ropes BAM! Big reveal that Dennis is Fusion in the form of him pulling an Xyz Fusion to beat Shun's 9x Ranked Up Cuntcrusher Falcon.<br><br>God I fucking hate marketing.</br></br></br>  THIS ARC OF SMILE<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>11556</wbr></br>  Why did they pick fusion as the bad guys?  <br> Still won't change his best boy status </br>  <br>Lavalval Chain helps many decks to have access to broken cards, but I don't think it's broken.<br>Infinity is overpowered, but not broken, Ptolemaius is the big problem.<br>And Vanity is fine.<br><br><br>Gonna ask you something, the hands are still good?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  WE FINALLY HAVE A MMD WITH A RIN MODEL!<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm265<wbr>78783</wbr></br>  <br>Superpoly was super evil.</br>  <br>Good enough to splash in anything that needs to fill some monster slots and can use them.<br>Just lost a bunch of their power lately.<br><br> Seriously, &gt;&gt;&gt;/dng, though. </br></br></br></br>  <br> Wasn't he blown down the stairs by Sora? <br>That duel was terrible compared to their first one. I wish they skipped Serena vs Dennis to show it properly.</br></br>  I'am free so who wants a duel on<br>Ygo Pro it just got an update with new cards only for the android version</br>  <br>Maybe. I thought for sure that when Dennis said Serena would be right along during the prison break that he actually meant he'd ported her back to the Fusion Dimension, but he didn't.</br>  <br>The first one is literally the best YGO duel of all time, most duels suck in comparison to it.</br>  His face looks more fox-like every episode.  <br> Lavalval Chain <br><br>why<br><br> Infinity <br>Agreed<br><br> Vanity <br>why</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>his forehead nose conjunction must have hurt that mom pretty badly in childbirth</br>  <br>No, but that one wasn't even a duel. They showed the beginning and the end and that's lame.<br><br>Meanwhile, if they skipped Serena vs Dennis, things like Tricklown wouldn't exist too.</br></br></br>  <br>They couldn't make it xyz as those are their big money makers and nobody cares about synchro and Ritual is a bad joke so it had to be Fusion by process of elimination.</br>  RURI~<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>05685</wbr></br>  <br>Q U A L I T Y</br>  <br> Lavalval Chain <br>It's fine<br> Infinity <br>The problem is the card in conjunction with Ptolemy that and the fact that you're allowed to use overlays on opponent's turns, it effectively can shut down anything if used properly, which is a bit much, deserves to at least be limited or allocated solely to Rank 5 decks, having it in Tellar is too much especially multiple.<br> Vanity <br>Needs to be banned.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't make this game more complicated than it already is.</br>  <br>Synchro already got to be the evil one in 5D's and Xyz was a bit overdone in Zexal<br>And Fusion makes the most sense story wise as it makes sense that Fusion dimension would be the one trying to fuse all dimension.</br></br>  <br><br>I like that we learned that Jean-Michel is actually just some lower dog and doesn't have that much power after all. Makes him somehow more interesting, dunno why</br></br>  <br>And what about the fags like me who just like Cyber Dragon and the fact that you can use Infinity with a lot of deck you may like (like NK or LS) is something I can love even though everyone else can also do it?</br>  <br> not overlaying the dimensions </br>  <br>I love Cyber Dragon too, but the card is a tad much considering it's not limited and can be used on either turn and keep consistent Xyz materials. It mostly just needs to be banned from Tellar, they can easily get two of them out in short work.</br>  <br>How do you make Cyber Dragon Nova or Infinity in NK or LS?</br>  <br>In LS you can use Clownblade and the milling does the rest. NK it's something I have never see tho.</br>  <br>how do you Noble Knight into infinity I need to know for science reasons.</br>  <br>How soon until he turns on the Council and attempts a coup or joins up with Leo as head henchman?</br>  <br> not fine tuning the dimensions </br>  <br><br>It's more of a tech anyway, I have a weird use of outdated cards like Call of the Haunted and Soul Charge, and sometimes I can make a Ptolemaius&gt;Nova&gt;Infinity, at least with NK, with LS is what  say.</br></br>  <br> outdated cards <br> Call of the Haunted and Soul Charge </br></br>  <br>the only NK combo that goes into infinity on its own would be. Brothers +2 fillers into pto into nova into infinity. But even then why would you even run it in Nobles? When will you ever have 3 monsters on the field.</br>  <br>The problem with Ptolemaus is that it took a deck that was already incredibly easy and cheap (Rank 4 spam) and then gave it Rank 5 spam. Now, there's basically no reason to play CyDras because Tellars do it better, and that's just a very sad place to be.</br>  <br>I've seen plenty of NK decks that get three monsters on the field rather easily.</br>  <br>tbh I don't even know why tellars exist except to raise the price of good xyz's. Komoney pls.</br>  <br> Not Penduluming the dimensions </br>  <br>Could you post the Ygopro download link? I'm a devpro user.</br>  <br>Because fuck, designing cards is hard. Here, have a Stratos, a Tin Goldfish, and a Wolfbark. They're archetype-specific. That's an archetype. It counts. Where's my cocaine?</br>  ALL THE POSTS IN THIS THREAD ARE NOW OVERLAY UNITS FOR MY MONSTER  <br>ah good it's only rank 105<br> xyz encore </br></br>  <br>I wanna bang this girl but she is my sister</br>    <br>Who are you? Are you even a Yugioh character? Because of Overlay you couldn't have been in DM, GX or 5Ds and I know you haven't been in Arc V. Are you a shitty OC donut steel?</br>  <br>Err what about Zexal aka Yugioh XYZ</br>  <br>Nothing wrong with that.</br>  <br>Never heard of it. Some kind of fanfic?</br>  <br>I wonder if there is going to be a remix of his OST, fuck that shit was awesome.</br>  <br>Because it's even more unsure where Jean will end up or what he'll do in the future. He tried to brush off the dimension stuff as nonsense in front of the council until he was called out by Azul, so he doesn't seem to be too loyal to his bosses.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Infinity can stay the fuck on the game for all I care, he can negate only once per turn and any beater can beat it, the one who deserves the ban is Trishula, no matter what form he takes, once broken, forever broken, and so, needs to be banned. And no, I don't care about the negate target effect, matter fact, that's another reason for it to be banned.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fusion: Leo <br> Standard: Yusho <br> Synchro: Jean <br>There you go, evil power trio.

The only reason her prediction for the match with Yuya didn't pan out was A) because he has some kind of fate-breaking power, as also seen by the Headmistress' crystal ball shattering, and/or B) it's difficult to properly predict fate using only one tarot card. Even if it was less than accurate, though, her ability to see the future would have been handy, and her ability to scry even more so.</br>   /a/ was afraid Crow was gonna steal the show <br> He still hasn't had a single proper duel yet <br><br>I know what they're doing.

I don't think her predictions are specific enough to be that helpful to the Lancers, and she'd be another head to keep count of and out of trouble.</br>  <br>The real reason is that Aoi Yuuki is expensive and they already have Kakki as pseudo main character.</br>  <br>Think how confused Jean-Michel would be, seeing someone ritual summon.

There was no reason to bring him back to begin with.</br>  <br><br>Huh? Jack is telling him the exact opposite. If anything Jack tells him to not use Egao dueling only to make himself happy so basically Yuya is supposed to go even beyond Egao and needs to entertain the crowd no matter how he himself feels. Which of course is bullshit, but that's exactly what Jack is doing as KINGU. <br>The only thing Yuya can take from this is being more persistent with his Entertainment dueling and just use it when he feels like it, which is also what Yoko told him</br></br></br>  <br>For all the crap he gets, Crow actually didnt win much at all in 5Ds. He jobbed more than Jack</br>  <br><br>This is just stupid. Arc-V Crow has nothing to do with 5Ds Crow and brining your hateboner for Crow to Arc-V is absolutely retarded. There is literally nothing wrong with Arc-V Crow</br></br>  <br>There is literally no reason for him to exist here either. Shinji could have easily taken Crow's role so far.</br>  <br><br>He didn't have a single loss in part 1 but in part 2 he jobbed quite a lot</br></br>  <br><br>The same logic Shinji has absolutely no reason to exist</br></br>  <br>No he didn't. Look at all his wins.<br><br>http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Crow_H<wbr>ogan#Duels</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Someone had to save Yuya &amp; Co.'s bacon when they first got to Synchro and then bust out of prison.<br><br><br>Also for someone who spent a decade in the clink, Hanafuda Man remained mark-free so what did Crow do in this dimension to warrant getting one?</br></br></br></br>  <br>And let's not forget that a Blackwings and RaidRaptors, be it in 1vs1 or as a team in a tag, is sounds like a pretty good opportunity for Winged-Beast infested comboes.</br>  <br>Maybe he was imprisoned before the marks were implemented.</br>  <br><br>Chojiro is a celebrity and also was the most powerful man in prison.

Fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At this rate, we actually may never go to XYZ if the series will follow the standard 150 episode allotment.</br>  <br>Well, we might see the Synchro Shun finally I guess.</br>  <br> At this rate, we actually may never go to XYZ <br> People actually thought this was going to happen </br></br>  <br>They were never going to go to XYZ dimension, there is no reason to since its already a lost cause.</br>  Why are people looking forward to Yuya's ideals being challenged ?  Give to me straight doc, does he have a chance?  <br>Because his ideals are retarded and not even his in the first place.</br>  <br>Yuya won't say ladies and gentlemen anymore. That's good enough</br>  <br>He'll struggle at first because of the riding aspect but I think he'll be alright.<br><br>He'll most likely lose, but his deck doesn't really counter Crow's and vice versa so it'll be fun to watch for the going back and forth part of duels people love</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, I'm giving him 40%</br>  <br>The only way he's winning is if Crow lets him win.</br>  <br>There is one reason: They're in a fucking tournament</br>  <br> And then, appearing before Yuya, is a teenage boy with a card in his hand. <br><br>Inb4 Yusei</br></br></br>  Why is the construction of the overlay network so satisfying compared to other summoning animations?  <br>Whatever it takes for Yuya to start tuning like a motherfucker for the rest of the synchro arc.</br>  <br>They may be retarded but they are his, it's not wrong.</br>  <br>Because nobody tries to challenge them. The only ones who do are portrayed as the villains. For example, Kachidoki and his two pawns mocking Yuya's mindset are portrayed as douchebags. Sora rejecting EGAO is self-explanitory since he is currently a villain. Yuri will probably reject the EGAO too and he is the villain. Even Reiji comes off as a dick for saying Yuya's kindness won't do shit on the battlefield, which is true.<br><br>Now Jack will probably be portrayed as an asshole for saying that Yuya's ideology is flawed even though Jack is right.</br></br></br>  <br> They may be retarded but they are his <br>But his ideals are copied from his father.</br></br>  <br>It won't be Yusei.  It will be ARC-V's best boy. </br>  <br>GUESS WHO'S BACK<br>BACK AGAIN<br>TSUKI'S BACK<br>TELL A FRIEND</br></br></br></br>  <br>HE WILL JOB-JOB-JOB<br><br>JOB AGAIN GAIN GAIN</br></br></br>  <br>I thought it would be the Synchro Shun.</br>  I miss Fino so much, /a/ ;__;<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3O2<wbr>YcnHSjw0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> Fino <br><br>Something about this name just feels evil</br></br></br>  <br>It's because it reminds you of the terrible finns.</br>  <br>I know right?

Those are the important facts that any anime staff and the author(s) discuss during their meetings.</br>  <br>Besides her being hot as fuck, she really was a breath of fresh air as a heroine. When Raul walked in on her naked or whatever, she didn't inmediately freak out and hit him, she let him exain the situation and actually fucking understood him and smiled like the semen demon she is.</br>  Is Fino waifu material?  <br>Of course, demon king is best waifu.</br>  <br>Very.</br>  <br>What's it say?</br>  <br>I prefer her as a daughter.</br>  <br>Daughter, sister, wife, friend.</br>  <br>The picture? <br>Yoroshikune, nice to meet you etc.</br></br>  <br>Nice to meet you.</br>  <br>She does in the OVA as well.<br>Man, this show was fun and the girls were too good.</br></br>  <br><br> Trips confirm </br></br>  <br> WITNESSED </br>  <br>that's like the only point of the whole show</br>  <br>No, she is too lewd.</br>  It was a good show.  <br><br> Satan trips </br></br>  <br>Fino please don't tempt me like that!</br>  Do I watch it again for the nipples?

The LN has 10 volumes, but I don't have the last 2 yet.</br>   wake up <br> thread still here </br>  "You've done well to make it this far into my dungeon, Hero."<br><br>Wat do, /a/?</br></br>  HAHAHAHAHA  I want a Fino x Onihime crossover.  <br>That show was meh, I don't know why /a/ clings to it so much.<br><br>Fino wasn't even good waifu material.</br></br></br>  <br>Fino is daughter material mate.</br>  <br> heir of the Demon Lord <br> fun to be around <br> teases and doesn't mind being teased <br> smoking hot <br> not good waifu material <br>u wot m8<br><br>It was a fun show for what it was.

Click it.</br></br>  <br>Can't you just fuck off with your number-faggotry?</br>  <br> http fapservice dot com slash yuushibu-fanservice-compilation/ </br>  <br> mfw </br>  <br>Wow.</br>  <br> Reasonably good MC <br> Perfect girl <br> No real haremshit, just OTP <br> Based imouto <br> Ecchi <br> Surprise sakuga <br>I need more of this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It had an interesting setting in general too.</br>  Fino is really cute.  <br>An LN starting with an interesting setting with magic in a mundane real world type environment that allows for funny hijinx and then doesn't devolve into some bullshit evil conspiracy chosen one adventure shit is a rare treat. Too many LN tease you with their unique hook only to let you down by becoming generic shit. This one stuck to it's guns, and that's something worth noting.</br>  How could there be such a good girl in such an awful show.  Anyone familiar with this series? Really similar feel and setting.<br><br>Raws:<br><br> http://manhua.dmzj.com/dbxdmwdr/ </br></br></br></br>    <br>The show was shit, but the Fino was amazing.<br><br>Especially since she was main girl. Such a rare combo.</br></br></br>  <br>ALL A nal  was the best girl of the show and she won the MC.<br><br>Sorry Fino, tsunderes are the superior beings.</br></br></br>  <br>0/10</br>  <br> Those shiny boils all over her body <br><br>I hate this, why did they do that?</br></br></br>  <br>I can normally tolerate these but they look like extra nipples here.<br><br>Getting a bit nauseated now, actually.</br></br></br>  <br>How does this manage to hide her nipples?</br>  <br>Demon magic.</br>    <br>to annoy autists like you.</br>  <br>damnit issei keep ur dress breaker in ur own series<br><br>also im glad to see a general approval of this series, it was quite enjoyable and fino had so many moments where she accidently became one of the cutest characters ive ever seen<br>(english not first language)</br></br></br></br>  <br> (english not first language) <br>I was about to come down on your hard, but you saved yourself.<br><br>Mind your capital letters and punctuation, and please don't become one of those people who tries to correct native speakers.<br><br> What's your mother tongue? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  I knew a girl in highschool everyone called All Anal.  <br>How many dicks do you have to take up your ass to earn that name?</br>  fino was fucking excellent, nothing has been good since  <br>It was less the number of dicks, and more that she would insist she only took it up the ass. Christians can be weird sometimes.</br>    <br>Based webm.</br>  <br>Any visual novels with similar plots that are good?<br><br>Any visual novels with similar plots that are translated?</br></br></br>  <br>I never heard of this Fino until now, but boy is my dick in orbit right now.</br>  Has anyone read the LN? Was curious to see how good it is.  Is there as much ZR as it looks? I don't think my penis would handle if it does.  <br>very different from the anime. there's actually a translation project going on now, though the guy might be dropping it soon hopefully he found an editor.</br>  <br>Shit on her chest because she isn't the Fino I'm looking for.</br>  <br>Lamchop de Axekiller</br>    <br> Fino 2.webm <br>That's All Anal.</br></br>  <br>This is Fino's work attire. She's really prominent in the show and they wear their uniform really often. You make the decision.</br>  Bump  <br>Fino means tasty on my mother tongue.</br>  <br><br>Sorry, I got a little confused. Should have named it Yusibu.webm instead.</br></br>  Rest In Fino thread.    <br>It's ok, Fino will keep spinning.</br>  Fino was great, the show was fair.  <br>Fino's legs are ripped.</br>  <br>As expected from the daughter of a demon lord.</br>  <br>The show was also great you geek. Fight me!</br>    I never finished this anime, I just sort of dropped it about halfway in.<br><br>I really should fix that.</br></br>        <br>At least one of us did</br>  <br> imgur <br> that quality </br></br>  <br>watching this due to the thread OP Good Job</br>  <br>Why is Fino so cute?</br>  What a fag  <br>Goddamit Raul!</br>  <br>At least he learns.</br>  <br> cute <br> shortstacks <br> looks good in any clothing <br> Gyahahaha! <br> ore-sama <br> kinda lacking on common sense <br> but listens instead of just getting mad about it <br> pretty innocent for a demon <br>And a myriad of other reasons.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who's that wizard in the stall?</br>  <br>It's different than the anime.<br><br>It's also an LN. That should tell you all you need to know.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Half of cast in anime is original, LN had some slut that stole Raul's first kiss and made Fino sad. There is manga adaptation of LN which has one chapter translated.<br>There is also manga adaptation of anime, which it seems it had better ending than anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I know about that kiss stealing slut and that there are less cast members. The anime has a better cast and uses them for humor as opposed to cheap romantic conflict so it's leagues better. If the anime had a conclusive ending or a fucking kiss it would have been perfect, but that's against the law for LN adaptations.</br>  <br> I thought it was against the law for LN adaptations to not be shit. </br>      I normally dislike bakas, but Fino is a miracle of the universe.  <br>Apparently Raul is a baller in the LNs.</br>  <br>It is. That's why they changed so much of the source and made this one good.</br>  <br>Why is she pouring perfectly good liquid on herself like that?</br>  She needs it to cure those inverted nipples.  <br> cure those inverted nipples <br>I hope you're just fishing for replies.</br></br>    <br>But they're cute.</br>  <br><br>... This image is really lewd even though objectively it shouldn't be.</br></br>  <br>wait who was the kiss stealing slut and what volume ?</br>  math sure is deadly  Remember the threads?  <br>The threads were comfy. We rarely had shit posters. <br><br>This was airing along with a hell of a lot of popular shows.</br></br></br>   No VN spinoff <br> No Ramses the Architect route ever </br>  <br>Holy jesus.<br> What did she do that was so bad? Is it all from siding with the bad dudes in the final episodes? </br></br>  <br>I remember the anti All-A alliance (aka as A4) we had. Good times.</br>  <br>Fuck off Lam-chan.</br>  <br>She was a bitch to Raul throughout whole anime.</br>  <br>She was a bitch to everyone.</br>  <br>I've seen many tsunderes get a pass for it. What denied her that?</br>  Why, The show was boring and wasted potential.  <br>Go be cancer somewhere else, Lefag.</br>  <br>this<br/></br>  <br>hahahahaa</br>  anyone have the LN illustrations? Can't find the raws.    How could she hide those here?  <br>She had a glass of milk afterwards.</br>  <br>Magic.</br>  <br>I believe it's because her breasts are made of the finest quality.</br>  <br> Fino <br> Finest <br>All makes sense now</br></br></br>  <br>Got the last 2; here is how the novels end:</br>  <br>Raul turns into a faceless rapist for the purest demon queen ever. ;_;</br>  <br>So what is the plot even about after they go save fino from the demon world? From what I heard that part is similar to the anime. The manager is still the person who killed the demon lord etc.</br>  <br>Rescuing Fino is volume 9.<br>This is the plot of volume 10:</br></br>  <br>Oh so the ending to the anime was basically the ending to the novel? I figured there was anotherp lot line they'd use.</br>  <br>I'm not fluent in Japanese, but the details of the quest for the little girl seem different.</br>  <br>Hot damn I love Fino. S2 when</br>  <br>So that is Fino right?</br>  <br>That's my opinion.</br>  <br> Light Novel finished  <br> No translation <br>Find a good reason to live.  Profit: you probably can, but not too many </br></br></br>  <br>there is a translation anon. the guy is (or was) looking for an editor to continue.</br>  <br>I only remember like 1 volume, though.  I sure hope they continue </br>  I just started watching this series!<br><br>I'm actually watching it and Chaika at the same time--what a freakin' contrast between two magic-dominated postwar worlds.<br><br>I kinda wish someone would make AMVs of the two ladies in the convenience store with audio from Kevin Smith's "Clerks"</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, you know, you could like, learn moon or something</br>  <br> chinese raws <br>Woah nigga you expect me to read that?</br></br>  <br>http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/there<wbr>s-a-demon-lord-on-the-floor-r14671</wbr></br>  So did the anime manage to pack 10 vols into one season, or what since the ending was the same? I'd love to see what they omitted.  <br>That season had Yuushibu and Outbreak Company. Those were 2 of the only LN adaptations I truly enjoyed.</br>  <br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=5<wbr>90006</wbr></br>  <br>While thank you for the torrent, let me rephrase. I'd love to be able to read what they omitted.</br>  <br>People always shit on annoying tsunderes. There's a small and very vocal fanbase of shit eaters who actually like that horrible archetype, but given that the main girl in this series is fucking perfect the shiteaters' voices got drowned out.</br>  <br>I can read moon. I promise you that you're not missing much by not being able to read LNs.</br>  <br> There's a small and very vocal fanbase of shit eaters <br>I'm pretty sure it was just a single anon who was blind and deaf, and some how clicked and hit random keys until some post coincidentally seemed like someone liked her.</br></br>  <br>why is Fino's hair so long?</br>  <br>All-Anal looks like an even bigger piece of shit in the LN</br>  <br>I was referring to tsundere lovers in general. Though it'd be nice to believe that no one on /a/ actually has taste that shit and it's all one big misunderstanding.</br>  <br>Ponytails can give the impression of a shorter hair. Also, magic.</br>  <br> It's out in Good language actually.  I wanted to buy it at one point and read it, but I guess I'll just buy used now.</br>  <br>how did actually end?</br>  She wins right?   thread dedicated to Fino still up <br>I love you you glorious motherfuckers.<br><br><br>She won our hearts and that's all that matters..  Of course she wins anon what the fuck! </br></br></br></br>  <br>kanojo! kanojo! kanojo!<br>ugh need to find that scene</br></br>    <br> ugh <br>Don't fag up the thread, faggot</br></br>  <br>there's spoiler up there somewhere. If it had closure I'm okay with it</br>  Rauleh!~  <br>   It's out in Good language actually. <br>Huh?</br></br>  <br>I made typo. Daijoubu daijoubu.</br>  <br>Those are some aggressive ass fangs.<br><br>Also somebody pointing out Fino being a shortstack, I had to look up her height again, because lol anime proportions.<br><br>Fino is 148cm or 4' 10". Holy shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's truly a miracle of the universe; being so little but still packing that much punch with a fine chest, a plump butt and meaty thighs. Her personality is just the icing on the cake.</br>  <br><br>whose shorter Fino or Hestia ?</br></br>  <br>It never says hestia's height to my knowledge, She's low in the 4' range though. Lili is only slightly shorter. And bell is Tiny.</br>  why can't my job be that fun and interesting?  <br>The same reason everything is better in anime: you're 3DPD and not 2D master race.</br>  BIG FAT DEMON TATS  <br>A half-demon whose demon powers are cancelled out by his hero father's powers who was raised by his mother to become demon lord but has to rely on bullshitting the demon princes and princesses into believing he's tough shit to get them to follow him</br>  <br>What? I thought Fino's father was a typical evil demon lord. Didn't he kill manager's brother or something?</br>  <br>This  you damn pig.</br>  i miss fino    <br> raised by his mother <br> his Hero father <br><br>Different story anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was a response to the Fino comment I thought he was talking about Fino's father. What story is that then? It sounds interesting.</br>  <br>I heard she married MC I'm the novels.</br>  <br><br>i was waiting for this picture to be posted. it is the best picture posted currently on the internet.</br></br>  <br><br>shut up faggot.</br></br>  <br>Did some ESLfag get their feelings hurt?</br>  <br><br>no, some ledditnigger tried to fit in.</br></br>  <br> ledditnigger <br>Keep spouting buzzwords, you mouth breathing retard.</br></br>  <br>What series is this?</br>  <br>Wow. This series really is very like yuyushibu. I wonder which came first.</br>  <br>Yuusha ni Narenakatta came out in 2012. Floor maou came out last year.</br>  <br>But Outbreak Company was fucking terrible.</br>  <br>But that's fucking wrong.</br>  <br>Any more info on this? Sorry But all the girls look the same how should I know this is Fino?</br>  <br>Fino's finos are nipped.</br>  fino a cute  bump  <br>It's pretty damn close. I wonder if anyone said anything in japan about how it's basically a clone of the base idea.</br>  <br>You could say the same thing for Yuusha ni Narenakatta to Maou-sama.</br>  <br>Which maou? there's quite a few.</br>  <br> Hataraku <br><br>Though on that note, how many Maou base series have been introduced since then?</br></br></br>  <br>Just maou titled? <br>Maou no Hajimekata<br>Maoyuu Maou Yuusha<br>Hataraku Maou-sama!<br>Kinda-Sorta <br>Kyou kara Ma no Tsuku Jiyuugyou!<br>As I mentioned it's a couple</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Can't believe that this thread is still going.  I'd hire her  <br>Fino love is eternal</br>  Fino makes me very funny down there  <br> I'll do whatever you want so please hire me <br>I'd hire her as well, Fino would be a good tier workmate.</br></br>   hurr durr durr the show was shit <br><br>It was fucking fun, that's all that matters.</br></br>  <br>I know right?<br>Not that I have a problem with that, Fino is pure sex. The show was almost complete trash but kinda saved by the fact that all the girls were 10/10.</br></br>  <br>It was fun but you have to admit the conflict in the story didn't even make sense.<br><br>" We want to be a Hero so we'll make the good daughter of the Demon King bad "<br><br>Why didn't Raul just report the Hero wannabes and tell the public they're the idiots who wants to ruin the peace.<br><br>It makes you wonder what the hell the author was smoking while writing the LN</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> all the girls were 10/10 <br> All A </br></br>  <br>Whoever wins we win.</br>       wake up a day and a half later <br><br>This thread is still here? I can see some parts of /a/ still have very fine taste. Good show sirs/madams</br></br>  <br>Everyone looks so different in the LN.</br>  <br><br>its even the same VA</br></br>  <br>The love never stops.</br>  <br>It's not.</br>  <br>There's no reason to believe that their government is a democracy. And the autocracy might support war.</br>  <br> &gt;All A <br>She really wasn't that bad. <br>I want to be protected by this smile.</br></br></br>  <br>worst girl</br>  Just curious; are there any cute vanilla Fino doujins?  <br> All A <br>She was pretty good.</br></br>  <br> We never get to see her wiggle her ears </br>    <br>How the fuck do I not remember this? I need to rewatch.</br>  <br>Would marry.</br>  <br> Those glorious tits every time I look at the catalog <br>My dick thanks you, OP.</br></br>  <br>Get in line.</br>  <br>Glorious Ore-sama tits. Would worship every morning if a thread like this was on every morning.</br>  <br>You're fucking terrible and that's a fucking fact.</br>   tfw upcoming episode has ash traveling to the future <br> tfw the preview pic is the wedding between him and serena </br>  <br>is this 5 months ago?</br>  <br>inb4 /vp/ faggotry.</br>  Reminder that May topped the /vp/ pokegirl tier list.  <br>Waith wat</br>  <br>You didn't realize there's now a ship in pokemon?</br>  <br>We really went through a lot of pokegirls through the ages haven't we.</br>  <br>it's canon, so brave yourself</br>  <br> we </br>  <br> tfw the preview pic is the wedding between him and serena <br>Obvious shop.

Why did it take almost a decade and a half for this STUPID idea to be used?</br>  <br> tfw he will still lose the most important one at the end </br>  <br> /vp/ has shit tastes  <br>Fascinating.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127735332 <br> pokemon isnt an anime <br><br>You know, I don't see anything particularly wrong with Pokémon being shunned on /a/, but that's simply retarded.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127735332 <br> not anime <br> cartoon <br>hahaha, oh wow</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127735332 <br>Hey it is anime. It's just that it's Pokemon related. I don't see a problem, and this is news to me brotha.</br>  So is Ash actually good now or his lvl 9999 porkachu keeps losing to water type pokemans?<br><br>I havent watched the series after the sinoh leage wich was pretty awesome tbh.</br></br>  <br>Elaborate.<br><br>Looks like fine taste to me.</br></br></br>  Anime discussion belongs to /a/, game and tcg discussion belongs to /vp/ is that fucking hard to understand?, i mean theres more anime than just the regular loli shit they watch here.  best meme  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127735332 <br>I bet you think Transformers is a cartoon also.</br>  <br>I wish, we'd be lucky to get 1-2 of those a season.</br>  Why is she so best?  <br>Is that May or that Serana chick?</br>  Old Ash is so much better than New Ash.<br><br>He used to be so fun and radiate all kinds of emotion. Nowadays he's like an empty shell with soulless eyes.</br></br>  <br> I just read up on what's been going <br>what, what's going on?</br></br>  <br>A girl actually has a crush on Ash.<br>She travels with him.<br>Plus some crap about some wedding.</br></br></br>  So how many times has Ash time traveled now?  <br>Serena is the best thing to happen in the anime for decades. The writer are actually trying now, and it shows. At this rate we might actually have a better League battle than D/P.</br>  <br>But the real question is, will they follow through with it?</br>  <br>Too bad about the Pokemon though, they must be unoriginal as shit.</br>  <br>Epic fail.</br>  The best.  Why are the /vp/ padt threads such cancer?  <br>A combination of people even /v/ rejected and the worst of waifufaggotry over a toy commercial of all things.</br>  <br> trusting /vp/ <br>It's probably the worst board when it comes to taste/opinions.</br></br>      <br>Don't like May or Rosa?</br>  Please go to your own board.    <br> Cynthia not first <br> Sabrina that low <br>This list is a disgrace</br></br></br>  They'll never be Yuya and Yuzu, guys.  <br>Pokemon is good now. Or at least at the moment. The first few episodes pretty much set the tone of what to expect for the rest of the run so far. If you still aren't interested afterward, you can skip only for the gym battle episodes.</br>  <br> Pokemon is good now <br>Please go to your own board.</br></br>  <br>Of course not. Serena will probably go 'I need to become a better performer so I can be a better match for Ash/Satoshi' or some other excuse for a new travelling companion. <br><br>Of course, I do have a small hope that they're building up Bonnie/Eureka and Dedenne is to replace Ash/Satoshi as the new protagonist for the remakes of the old games. That way, all the character development for Ash/Satoshi will actually stick.</br></br></br>  Post Pokegirls!  <br> I need to become a better performer so I can be a better match for Ash/Satoshi <br>I don't see how that'd even work.</br></br>  <br>Tell that to the high execs.</br>  starting a dump        <br>Aren't they the ones that caused the whole B/W mess and even put Serena liking Ash in the limelight? I still don't see how it'd work.</br>      <br>Just like how Ash/Satoshi needs to win 8 badges to compete in the League for a chnace to become a master, Serena needs to win X performances for a chance to compete in the Ash/Satoshi bowl.</br>  <br>page 8 won't upload so:<br>http://i.imgur.com/9MXahnE.jpg</br></br>  <br> now it does go through <br><br>ok</br></br></br>      <br><br> 38 vote turnout <br><br>How about an actual poll next time</br></br></br></br>  <br>That still doesn't work. Also, are you assuming winning the league means he becomes a master?</br>      <br>I think they're  fun <br><br>also,<br> not liking Pokegirls </br></br></br></br>              <br>I like Rosa in terms of design. But you have to agree that list is bullshit. Sapphire is not May. May (Game) is not May (anime). The same applies to Dawn and Serena. Also a nigger, from B/W no less, is higher than Sabrina and Agatha. And there's no Kris, Greta, Lucy or Caitlin.

I know some cartoons had help from animators from Japan, Thundercats was one of the ones I can think of. You can tell which ones had help because a few cartoons have an anime feel to them. But a lot of that was from the 80's though.</br></br>  <br>Transformers was animated by Toei.</br>  <br> I'm not watching any other anime this season </br>  <br> I'm not watching Pokemon </br>  I just want to see ash shitting all over the new guys and winning leagues.  <br>Watch his battle with Shota.</br>  <br>But I do.<br>Occasional good animation and shipperbait doesn't make the rest not boring.</br></br>   Ash becomes a dad <br> Serena isn't the mother <br> Bonnie steps the fuck up to ntr serena <br><br>based</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ash does very rarely completely steamroll his opponents.<br><br>He beat Crasher Wake 3-0. When he double-battled Shota, he won 2-0, and when he had a 3-on-3 battle with Shota again, he won 3-0.<br><br>Ash is also consistently the one who carries team whenever there's a group battle. During the Triple Battle against the rival trio, Serena's Fennekin was knocked out pretty much immediately and Ash's Pikachu K.O.'d the entire opposition with Clemont's Chespin only able to play support. There are also multiple points where Ash has to save everyone's asses because even when Clemont and Serena team up, they have a difficult time.<br><br>Ash has always been consistently the best trainer of the group in all the shows, but it's never been more ridiculously obvious here. Serena's dead weight no matter what she does. She doesn't really train much at all, since Performing has no battle segments, meaning strength is entirely meaningless to her. As a result, her battle skills are absolute shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Serena plays mom in episode 77.</br>  the real question is will they  FUCK ?  <br> used Thunderbolt on a Rhyperior <br><br>he's still a moron</br></br></br>  How can people still watch pokemon.<br><br>I remember watching this shit when I was a kid and Misty was still queen of adolescent wet dreams. I tried going back to watch some of this from gen1 and it is literally shit. Not even nostalgia could save it.<br><br>Are you all just 13? I really fucking hope so.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good animated battles.</br>  <br>because its fun</br>  <br>Nisioisin seal of aprove</br>  <br>1 - awesome battles<br>2 - waifus/shipping  which probably makes up for 75% of why people watch animu </br></br>  <br><br>Never, just like the other girls. <br><br><br><br> I only watch edgy anime for adults </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> waifus <br>Gen5 and Gen6 had a lot of them. I have to choose them the pokemon way, team of 6</br></br></br>  <br> tried going back and watching the old shit <br> not the new shit people are actually watching </br></br>  <br>The XY anime is delivering like mad</br>  <br>Bonnie tried.</br>  <br><br>Even the gyms are loaded</br></br>  <br>Even the KINDERGARTENS are.</br>  <br><br>Even extras</br></br>  Why aren't there more gyms with beautiful ladies?  <br>Me too. I don't see how people can skip large chunks of a series, if you're going to watch it actually watch it.</br>  <br><br>Well it all comes down to if the episode has anything to do with the overall story. I find most Pokemon episodes don't have anything to do with the story so I don't watch those. I can skip a few episodes and still be pretty well off in knowing what is going on.</br></br>  <br> [RG] </br>  <br>Nah.<br>Probably Winter though. And maybe last Summer.</br></br>  <br> tfw have to wait 2 years for the next chapter </br>  <br>what the fuck? ORAS may too? absolutely appalling</br>  <br> there are people who genuinely believe the new haircut is shit </br>  <br>Haircut is fine. That stupid cape/jacket thing is fucking ugly though.</br>  <br>Is that supposed to be ash? <br>He looks terrible.</br></br>  <br>No. Learn to read.</br>  <br> 2 years <br>Fuck Korean military service, I mean it, even most backwater European shitholes have done away with mandatory military service by now</br></br>  <br>Don't forget Gen4. Sinnoh has a bunch of cute gym leaders.<br> But god damn I miss Gen5 just for Bianca, even B2W2's nice atmosphere is secondary </br></br>  <br>Blame China for propping up Best Korea.<br> muh buffer nation </br></br>  <br>No it's a cotd named Frank. Someone shopped the picture to make him and his wife look like Ash and Serena to ruse idiots.</br>  <br>It's just that mandatory military service won't solve that problem, especially when you have it over such a long timeframe like holy shit 2 whole years. People could be getting a job or a college degree during that time, you're putting people's lives on standby for 2 full years. You're not gonna get a nation of trained soldiers with that, all you're getting is a bunch of unmotivated slobs who don't want anything else but to go home.</br>  STILL <br>NO<br>3DS<br>EMULATOR<br><br>How irritating. Wouldn't watch the anime without playing the games first.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just watch the show man.<br>It's way better than the games anyway.</br></br>  <br>Are you fucking stupid?</br>  <br><br> Misty <br> 16th Place <br><br>Holy shit, as if I needed another reason to avoid that fucking board</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you like Gen I then yes don't go to /vp/, they'll rip you to pieces</br>  <br>Genwunner pls</br>  <br> Winona literally 1 vote <br>shit fucking taste indeed</br></br>  <br>She's shit compared to everyone except Iris.</br>  <br> Liking Misty over Iris <br>You're sucha kid anon.</br></br>  I want to battle a nice body gym leader  Some viewers don't even know who she is.  <br> late 90s kids <br><br>Please kill yourself</br></br></br>  <br>Some viewers who watched the original season as children are dead</br>  <br>They do now.</br>  <br>The nostalgia is strong with /vp/, which makes sense I guess. Pokemon is entirely built on nostalgia.</br>  <br> some people in /a/ seriously think Origins was good </br>  <br>wuh</br>  <br>It had some memorable moments. Like the charmander screaming in agony after a bite attack. That was, well, new.</br>  Whatever happened to that chick who looked like a dude? The frontier brain one, at least I think that's what it was called.  <br><br>Red actually became a champion though</br></br>  <br>Never showed up again after her two-parter. Why would you expect her to?</br>  <br>I don't know, yeah? I mean Brock did.</br>  <br>Brock was a cast member, she was a regular gym leader with a different name.</br>  <br> red <br><br><br>buy a 3ds you poorfuck<br><br><br>no this is ash</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's because all his opponents were shit.<br><br>Red's a terrible trainer himself. Charizard's literally his only worthwhile mon and he fails to come up with any decent strategies. He basically just powers through and hopes for the best. <br><br>If he battled Ash, I'm 80% certain Ash would win.</br></br></br></br></br>   HE IS 10  <br> T E N <br> E <br> N </br></br></br>   XY will last 2 more years <br> Ash will most likely get his 7th badge in august <br>what will happen after the league?</br></br>  IF SERENA LOSES WE RIOT  <br> XY will last 2 more years <br><br>Wh-what?. How? Is that why Ash doesn't have a full team yet? Is that the reason Serena only has three fucking Pokemon?</br></br></br>  <br> 10 </br>  <br> Shauna not even there <br><br>THAT<br>FUCKING<br>SHIT<br>TASTE</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>most likely, yeah</br>  <br>Elite 4 battles that take place in Southern Kalos.</br>  <br> not 10 at all </br>  <br><br>Is a different studio doing this? The differences in art style is almost palpable.</br></br>  <br>Because the games, Gen VII won't be until at least 2017</br>  <br>She already won her TriPokalon, though.</br>  <br>Filler shit. Probably go back to Hoenn for some reason or to a whole new region. Likely plot lines are either Ash trying to achieve Mega Evolution, fighting Team Flare, or Armageddon: Pokemon version</br>  <br>I think he means the ashbowl</br>  <br>The Ashbowl is inherently unwinnable. there's a design flaw that makes it so that no matter how hard you try, you'll never reach the goal.</br>  vote<br>http://strawpoll.me/4859459</br>  <br>What a fucking shit list</br>  <br>DP was the league Ash was supposed to win with but they trashed the idea that's why you saw that one year gap between 7th and 8th gym. That type was supposed to be for the E4 and champ<br><br><br>Probably, probably not, we see most of these quality in series nowadays too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Serena will overcome that flaw</br>  <br>I'm not talking about quality, but art style. It looks like a different person is responsible for the key art for this movie.</br>  <br>rosa is such a qt</br>  <br>The day Serena wins is the day the show ends.<br><br>I don't see the show ending.</br></br></br>  <br> hilda is better though </br>  <br>It's the same artstyle they used since the start of XY, the quality is only increased a little during movies.<br><br>But if you are comparing XY artstyle to other series, yes, it's completely different. They changed most of their team after that BW wreck.</br></br></br>  <br>Gen VI has outstanding waifu material<br>Too bad the games are shit</br></br>    <br> DP was the league Ash was supposed to win with but they trashed the idea that's why you saw that one year gap between 7th and 8th gym. That type was supposed to be for the E4 and champ <br>That series did have a sense of finality to it. I wonder if Ash was going to keep being the main character or if they would have used a new one and tried to mix it up a bit</br></br>  <br><br><br>Best girls will never make an appearance in the anime</br></br></br>    <br>Show doesn't have to end per se.</br>  <br><br>Can't they just let Ash win the league and then reboot the series with an Ash from a different universe? They could even let a girl win for once and then do some sort of omnibus ending you usually see in VN adaptations.</br></br>   not watching pokemon for lolis   <br> hilda nor rosa will never be ruined by the anime <br><br>I see no issue here<br><br>Rosa got a pretty awesome animated trailer</br></br></br></br></br>  While I'm not caught up on XY, they've been doing a fantastic job thus far and the quality of some of the battles is excellent. Unless they do something to completely drop the ball (inb4 Serena's hair), it's shaping up to be a great season.  <br>love from showderp, bye /a/nimefags</br>  <br>Pokemon are nearing their 20th anniversary and with this pace and storyline they are currently making with XY, they are likely trying to end the series right now. If they are trying to end it right now, of course they would Ash let win this time and also might give the girl to him and then reboot.</br>  <br><br>I all the girls are lovely</br></br>  <br>You don't seem to grasp what I'm saying.<br><br>This literally looks like someone else is trying to emulate the artstyle used so far. But the thing is, there are always gonna be subtle differences between artists no matter how well they try to emulate it. <br><br>The art in the movie has subtle differences from the show. Of course, even the show has different key artists for different episodes, but the movie looks like it's being done by a different guy. At the very least, the guy who's in charge of the art for the movie isn't among the show's regulars.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No DOGARS <br>Opinions discarded<br>I bet this survey was from their anime general</br></br></br>  <br><br>I can agree with that</br></br>  R18  <br>If they wanted to keep the anime going they could pull a Naruto and set it in the future and make the MC Ash and Serenas kid.

With X/Y being the first venture into 3D for the portable games, it was an enjoyable game but had so much more potential. The post-story content was lacking but the new content such as customization, swarms, etc. made it a fun new experience. ORAS didn't feel compelling to keep playing. Not because it was a remake but because the content was a step backwards from a lot of the features we had previously, such as in B/W B2/W2 X/Y. Though physically flying around Hoenn was cool.</br>  <br>pls no more rabies</br>  <br>Half of that is nitpicking and the other wishful thinking.</br>  <br><br>Maybe they should have parody subs like TFS DBZ</br></br>  where when you when meowth was catched  <br>I would if the Pokemon dub wasn't so awful since TPCi got a hold of it.<br><br><br><br>That's called 1Kids: his parody is more entertaining than TPCi's dub in general.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Meowth is a Wild Pokémon <br>You'd think one of the Rockets would have caught him at least as a formality</br></br>  serena best waifu  <br>If not Pikachu, it would have to be another cutesy Pokémon to keep the target demographic. As much as a cool partner would be neat, it would have to be a small Pokémon that can stick around without distracting from the scenes or one that intimidates Team Rocket or whoever the antagonists of a new series would be.<br><br>If they don't plan on making it a (extremely) long running series, they could even have it evolve at points throughout the anime.</br></br></br>  There is something in pokegirls, the way they are drawn, that makes my dick tingle everytime I pass by threads like this  <br>He doesn't want to be caught.</br>  <br><br>The animators aren't afraid of soccer moms anymore</br></br>  <br>you didn't post the webm</br>  <br><br>Didn't know it existed, besides I didn't know that Serena had a huge rump</br></br>  <br>because they are  ten </br>  <br>What about a pokemon that was human height?

Haute couture is fashion that is constructed by hand from start to finish, made from high quality, expensive, often unusual fabric and sewn with extreme attention to detail and finished by the most experienced and capable sewers, often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques. Couture translates literally from French as "dressmaking", but may also refer to fashion, sewing, or needlework and is also used as a common abbreviation of haute couture and refers to the same thing in spirit. Haute translates literally to "high". A haute couture garment is often made for a client, tailored specifically for the wearer's measurements and body stance. Considering the amount of time, money, and skill that is allotted to each completed piece, haute couture garments are also described as having no price tag</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127762495 <br> BOOYAH <br>it's not 2003 anymore grandpa</br></br>  <br>Dont make hit those showers.</br>  <br> raccoon <br><br> racoon <br>Raccoon Dog<br>Tanuki are a canid, related to foxes, wolves and anon's pet poodle.<br>The only thing they have in common with raccoons, is a dark mask around the eyes, and the fact that basic taxonomy isn't popular with subbers.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> grandpa <br>He was pretty obviously 13.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127762495 <br> moeshit <br>Back to your Junjo Romantica containment thread</br></br>  <br>I seriously hope this is pasta or I'll label you a faggot right here and now.</br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute<wbr>_couture</wbr></br>  <br>Not enough buckets to catch the rainwater.

Nobody's judging you here  faggot. </br>  <br> Nobody's judging <br><br>I am. <br><br><br>Fuck off back to /mlp/ you ESL retard. Don't sully NNB threads with your faggotry.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I forgot Renge was in school in the first season so I was lost for the first few minutes.</br>  <br>I thought maybe she was in kindergarten in S1. I didn't understand it was a prequel until anons pointed it out.</br>    <br>Hotaru moving should have clued you in.</br>  <br> until anons pointed it out <br>Until Hotaru appeared, I might understand, but you had to have it pointed out to you?</br></br>  <br><br>I'm sorry, I'm a little slow on the uptake.</br></br>  <br><br> Try F5 as well. </br></br>  <br>2nded<br><br>until the end</br></br></br>  Why does the NNB universe always shits on Hikage? She just wanted to be cool god dammit.  <br>Maybe she should stop trying so hard and being a braggart.</br>  <br>You want her to be cool? Fuck her. That way she can go home and brag about losing her virginity to all the innocent little country girls who will look up to her like a mature adult.</br>  <br> bragging about losing your virginity <br><br>no, that'd be komari</br></br></br>  <br>It'd be both. <br><br>Man, I wish I lived there.</br></br></br>  Why does she wear the mask?  <br>I've been reading alot of comments about this. Is this show subtlety meant to be dark? Or are people just trying to nit pick on everything which can support it being dark?</br>  <br>It is kind of dark at times.</br>  <br>it's not dark at all. posting edgy theories about NNB has become a meme at this point</br>  It's like show is trying to tell me that living in a rural area is great.  <br>Just like how other school anime tell you that you will have a harem when going into highschool.</br>    <br>It actually happens in Japanese highschools. The girls there all want to fuck antisocial nerds.</br>  <br>me neither, i forgot the entire season 1</br>  <br>Why does this happen?</br>  <br><br>Anon why don't you check it out and see for yourself? Also, it's spelled subtly. <br><br> and it's not dark at all, it's peaceful and beautiful and often genuinely funny. </br></br></br></br>  <br>My mind went blank when Hotaru talked about making friends</br>  <br>Natsumi pls</br>  <br><br>It doesn't, baka.</br></br>     OP by nano.RIPE <br><br>So funky</br></br>  <br>Good one.</br>  <br> mfw I didn't realize until the end </br>  <br>The story of my life.</br>  <br>Then where did the harem genre come from? It must have been influence by something.</br>  <br>Non Non Biyori is way more subtle about it. <br><br>The girls don't repeat that they love that place and would never want to live anywhere else etc. like it happenes quite often in anime - Lagrange, Oorai. <br><br>It's just the place where they live their youth.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you slow, anon? It was influenced by something alright. The universal fantasies of lonely antisocial nerds everywhere, (and specifically in Japan).</br></br>  <br>and where did the fantasies of lonely antisocial nerds came from? They must have been influenced by something as well.</br>  <br><br>Nope.</br></br>  <br>What do you mean nope?</br>  <br><br>I mean I'll not be gently trolled any further. I clearly need to sleep.</br></br>  <br>I too won't be tricked any further, I'll just take  as fact and move on.</br>  Why are they so autistic?  <br>artistic?</br>  <br/>  <br>That's what happens when you grow up in an isolated rural area sorely lacking in other people your age to interact with.  I should know. </br>  Since when does CR put honorifics in their subs? Kind of an improvement.  <br>When the joke requires it.</br>  <br>I think it varies between shows, probably depends on the individual doing the translating, but I think I've been noticing them more.<br><br>except this whole episode used honorifics.</br></br></br>  <br>well it could have been "Ms. Renge," "Lady Renge," "Renge Your Majesty" or some bullshit. I can think of a few fansub groups who have done that kind of thing.</br>  <br>It varies hugely by show. They tend to keep them for shows set in Japan and drop them in fantasy/foreign settings or something.</br>  <br>Varies by audience. They know NNB is patrician shit so their viewers will understand basic stuff like honorifics and don't need to be spoonfed.</br>  <br>Nobody would use any of these to address elementary students on an opening ceremony. You can't translate it.  Unless the -san is not standard in these ceremonies. </br>  <br>An actual patrician wouldn't need somebody else to tell him what people in his cartoon are saying.</br>    <br>plz no bully</br>  The marching in the OP is one of the cutest scenes I've ever seen  <br>Did Koma-chan go on a diet?</br>  Is this anime original? <br>When's Okinawa?</br>  <br>More importantly, did Hotaru put on weight? She looks even more deliciously plump than usual</br>  What is haute couture?  <br><br>No.</br></br>  <br> Gakkou Gurashi <br>you almost got me there</br></br>    <br>She's such a spaz.</br>  <br>I didn't realize it until after I watched it, went on /a/ and someone mentioned it.</br>  <br>It took me till I saw Hotaru to realize. <br> tfw I made forum posts about it <br> tfw I didn't know if s2 would just be a repeat of s1 </br></br></br>  <br>It's a cute show with some dark commentary on the depopulation of Japanese countryside under the surface.</br>  <br> not going full pregnant </br>  <br>Official art is always so shitty.</br>  Why doesn't the sensei just take Ren-chan to school? Ren always wakes up earlier anyway.  <br>What would she do while she waited several hours for school to start?</br>  <br>Play around near the school. The same kind of things she always does when she's home.</br>  <br> play <br>What is this "play" you speak of ?</br></br>  Speaking like that is bad manners you rude little kid.  Watching this anime I can't help but raise a simple fundamental question<br><br>Why do they even live there in the first place?<br>No job opportunity<br>No entertainment<br>No civilization<br>No anything new whatever<br>And hell even no education opportunity for children. Just imagine how much will this kids have to miss in their youth for the sake of living in this nowhere shithole<br><br>Seriously, why do they do it? Is it a medieval age where they can't move to other place without the lord's permission?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>their parents are farmers</br>  On my tenth rewatch now.<br><br>This shit is addicting.</br></br>  <br><br>Dude in not even 10 minutes they can to other town/cities.<br><br>It's the same where I live.<br><br>In 5 minutes I can to other towns and in 10 to cities (and in 30 to the biggest city in the region)<br><br> Seriously, why do they do it? <br><br>Try to use your brain a little more, that's all I can recommend to you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They can go to tokyo if they want I guess, but the education and the jobs that they can get are OK.<br>The lack of males is a problem though.</br></br>  <br><br>Your world is so small m8.</br></br>  <br> The lack of males is a problem though. <br>There are many males in the village, they just aren't shown.</br></br>  <br> a rural Japanese town <br> single-carriage diesel train (yes, unelectrified) coming once in an hour <br> can get to other town in 10 minues <br><br>I don't think so. The rural-ness of the town of NNB is simply beyond imagination. Can't even use a mobile phone? Holy shit<br><br><br>Not at all. What kind of facilities have you see in NNB beside that almost ran-down school and bloody farms beyond farms. Both job and education hitting the bare minimum level, /a/non, even worse than such place in  Wales </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ARE my methods... "unsound"? <br> I don't see any method at all, sir. </br></br>  <br><br> &gt;single-carriage diesel train (yes, unelectrified) coming once in an hour <br><br>So? We don't even have that shit here.<br><br>What are cars, bikes etc.<br><br> I don't think so <br><br>Read the manga or keep watching the anime and see for yourself.<br><br> Both job and education hitting the bare minimum level <br><br>See pic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're right, all the farmers should live in cities and farm crops on thier lawn.</br></br>   expecting cute slice of life <br> this happens https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=44b<wbr>4Zxw6agg</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>fucking anime im done</br></br></br>  <br> Nobody would use any of these to address elementary students on an opening ceremony. <br>No one would use sama or dono either.</br></br>  Who is she talking to?  <br>Me.</br>  That little gasp, she's too adorable.  <br>This guy </br>  <br>I want to motorboat Komari's belly.</br>  Would /a/ explain pregnancy to her?  <br>Sex.</br>    <br>who needs to explain when you can do a live demonstration</br>  Did she cum in the gym?  <br>doujins fucking when</br>  <br>No, but everyone else did.</br>  tfw you have to wait for this weekly because no one is TLing the mango<br><br>Give me my pretty autistic green haired lab rat</br></br>  <br>MUH DICK</br>  <br>Maybe not, she's already used to watching her flies fuck</br>  <br>The manga seems kind of crap compared to the anime.</br>  <br>this guy has to have a lot of self-control not to pitch a tent there</br>  <br>Japan has taught us that women can't win against cock, and she's getting a good whiff right there.<br><br>She's done for.</br></br></br>  I would thoroughly know her up, OP.  <br>Is she a student or a teacher?</br>  <br>Student.<br><br>You not watched the episode yet?</br></br></br>  <br>I mean, no one is translating the LNs either<br><br>You actually have to be an animeonlyfag unless you can read moon</br></br></br>  <br>Im bad at explaining things , so i'll just provide a live demo.</br>  <br>I would.</br>  truly, AOTS  <br>Anime Kajo makes my dick so fucking hard<br><br>And the fact that she's that lewd makes it go straight past diamond mode<br><br>I was literally half chub to full erect that entire episode</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course, such a disgusting lack of knowledge in basic biology is nothing short of sin.<br><br>The state of their education is horrifying.

The sperm can then travel up through the cervix, into the uterus, and, if an egg is present, the sperm may fertilize it.<br>It is also possible — but less likely — for women to become pregnant through any kind of sex play in which semen, or ejaculate, comes in contact with the vulva. The sperm can travel through the moisture on the vulva into the vagina.<br>Another way for a woman to get pregnant is through alternative insemination. During alternative insemination, sperm are inserted into a woman’s vagina or uterus using a syringe or other device. The sperm may come from a woman’s male partner, or from a donor. When a sperm donor is used, the procedure is sometimes called donor insemination. Alternative insemination is an option for single women, women who have women partners, or for couples who are dealing with infertility.<br>A woman who is dealing with infertility may also get pregnant through other fertility treatments like in vitro fertilization. To do this, a woman’s eggs are taken out of her body and combined with sperm. Then, one or more of the fertilized eggs are implanted back into the uterus.</br></br></br></br></br>   Talks about ignorance <br> Uses the word "docking" <br>Japan, JAPAN<br>GOOGLE IT FIRST JAPAN</br></br></br>    <br>They aren't actually using the word docking you sperg, they are simply using a random word as a vague euphemism for sex that the necklaces don't pick up on, and then for the sub someone translated it as 'docking'</br>  <br>So the pres is actually a closet pervert?</br>  So when are those things gonna get removed from their necks.

There is a lot of interesting crap going on and furry bullshit aside, there's fun mythology and lore and crap. If you were thrown in this world far away from the main cast, you'd still have fun.<br><br>Yuru Yuri is a character-based universe. It's all revolving around the main cast and the world outside of them is just that, a world. If you were thrown in this universe far away from the main cast, you wouldn't have fun - it would be the same world as ours.<br><br>There is still a lot of potential for horrible things, however, as Anonymous tries to project onto these girls. Thankfully, due to limited girl quota, this will not ever be as big as bronies, and at worst we'll just have a couple of Anons circlejerking in these threads, maybe spilling over to some other sites a tiny bit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Would Chinatsu fuck a horse?</br>  <br> If you were thrown in this universe far away from the main cast, you wouldn't have fun <br>You wouldn't have fun going on loli adventures with Hanako and friends, anon?</br></br>  <br>Lets move on please, I really don't like talking about this in a potentially comfy thread</br>  <br>I would fuck Chinatsu if you know what I'm saying.</br>  <br>Please, just stop. This is a fun happy Yuru thread. go somewhere else with that. Thank you.</br>  <br>I'm not grasping the concept you're trying to get to</br>  <br> Vice President: Kyouko <br> not Ayano, who is literally a vice president </br></br>  <br>Give her a taste of her own medicine if you catch my drift.</br>  Hey how does Yui support herself? do her parents pay for shit or does she have a job?  <br>The landlord is a relative. She has connections you know.</br>  <br>Her parents pay for an apartment so their middle schooler daughter can live alone in an apartment located in the same city attend the same school as before. They must really hate her.</br>  <br>She has an allowance and the apartment is owned by her aunt or something. <br><br><br>Why? Is Chinatsu sick?</br></br></br></br>  My guess? Yui was raped by her father and her mother found out about it. Then they try to sweep the deed under the table so the father doesn't have to go to jail. That's why Yui cannot live at her house with her family, it would be too traumatic for her and the rest of her family.  <br>Edgy-kun pls go<br> and stay go [/spoiler ] </br></br>  <br>shit just got heavy man...<br>you've got to man up... so you can defend yourself and your friends... against rape... from your dad...<br><br>you're a horrible person anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>His father has good taste</br>  <br>Yui seemed to be pretty casual about it</br>  <br> his </br>  <br>Effects of trauma. Yui literally cannot express how she feels, it is too horrible. Instead she spends hours alone in the apartment staring into a computer screen that isn't even plugged in.</br>  <br>Yeah. But don't worry. I'll make her all better.</br>  <br>Are you per chance a doctor of some sort?</br>  <br>I've been to one before. I said not to worry.</br>  <br>who uses a mousepad as small as that<br>is she using 6400 dpi or something?</br></br>  What type of music do the Yuri's listen to?  <br>It doesn't matter, anon. The mouse isn't connected to anything. Nothing is. Everything is broken.</br>  <br>But Yui only uses the pc to lurk /v/ she's a console only pleb <br><br><br>That's like saying you're an astronaut because you've looked at stars before. Are you sure you can help China get better? We should get a second opinion</br></br></br></br>  <br>Chizuru has great taste in Black Metal</br>  <br>Creepy Tsukasa pls go<br> Where did those even come from anyway? </br></br>  <br>Alright. You're ugly, too.<br><br><br>I don't know, but Mirakurun's themes are bitchin</br></br></br></br>  <br>do j-rpgs even get PC ports? it seems like they'd be fine sticking to consoles<br><br>the void</br></br></br>  <br>There's been many more coming out lately, the quality of said ports varies greatly.</br>  <br> father <br> male <br> in the yuruverse </br></br></br>  <br>Her dad was a busdriver</br>  <br>Fuck off Yui is still my favorite yuru and I would gladly grind the days away with her but only having 1 game system limits a lot what you can play. <br><br><br>A few of them get like the neps and now the tales of series but not that many do</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, no.<br> second opinion </br></br>  <br>Yuruverse is surprisingly full of males and heterosexuality.</br>  Why do you faggot hate Chinatsu?  <br>why do you defend her? are you an artfag or something?</br>  <br>Since when does a bundle of sticks have the ability to harbor feelings, especially towards those citizens of the 2D variety?<br><br>Has science truly gone too far?</br></br></br>  <br>Please go somewhere else with your sad little daily circlejerk. Thank you.</br>  <br>S-shitpost-chan, is that you?</br>  <br>As an artist, I suffer from Chinatsu Syndrome (or CS). I applied to a prestigious design school (because someone I loved was doing it) at the very last minute literally crapping out my portfolio and somehow got in. But every time I actually try to work on something it always ends up looking like an autistic satan spawn made it.<br><br>In light of this evidence, I believe that if Chinatsu stays distracted long enough, she will get in to art school, and not become the second coming of Hitler.</br></br></br>  <br>...<br/></br>    <br>Pretty much what happens.<br>Chinatsu Syndrome is a real thing. You can learn to live with it though.</br></br>  <br>I doubt something that bad can ever happen with us, we'll be alright.</br>  <br>I agree.</br>  In the ending Akarin says "I'm having an delusion"<br>But Akarin isn't really the type to have delusions, at least compared to other characters<br>Only logical conclusion is that the entire series is a delusion that Akari is having</br></br>  <br>you're a delusion Akari is having.</br>  How can yurus be real if lesbians aren't real?  <br>They aren't lesbians. Lesbianism doesn't exist in Japan except as a meme.</br>  <br>I didn't know Jaden watched YrYr...</br>    <br>Except Sakurako.</br>  <br>That's a funny way to spell Chizuru.</br>  <br>But Anon, white hair is for purity.</br>  <br>Are her eyes just the wrong colour here, or is it meant to be another character?</br>  <br>  They're clones made by Chizuru  </br>      <br>What's with the floating knife?</br>  <br>Why not both?</br>    Watched the second season of this show after watching the first one. Went from not liking Chinatsu to thinking she's not so bad<br><br>Now I dislike the writer for bullying Akari all the time</br></br>  <br>Aka-who?</br>  <br> Now I dislike the writer for bullying Akari all the time <br>But Kyouko is the one bullying Akari all the time.</br></br>  <br>I think Chinatsu is the one who was molested by her father. Remember when she said fathers are scary? She's probably having PTSD from her father and heterosexuality, causing her to become a lesbian.<br><br>That rift in her family explains why her parents are always away, as shown in S1 episode 5.<br><br>The only reason Tomoko praises Chinatsu a lot is because she knows how emotionally scarred Chinatsu is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> disliking namori </br>  <br> causing her to become a lesbian </br>    <br/>  <br><br>They were actually just referencing a common phrase in Japan or something.</br></br>  The mind of a killer lies behind those eyes, I tell ya.  DON'T DIE, YURU THREAD<br><br>LET'S TALK ABOUT AYANO</br></br>    <br>I agree, Sakurako is a stain on the perfection that is Yuru Yuri.</br>  <br>Will you pee on everything I love?</br>    <br>You're a stain on the comfiness of this thread.</br>  <br>no u</br>  <br><br> Talk about the character who has even less of a presence than Akari </br></br>  <br> the comfiness of this thread <br>Go suck a dick in a NNB thread.</br></br>    <br>i-i don't get how what i said is related to nnb why are you being so mean</br>    Sakurako must go.  <br>Damn her braids used to be massive.

The Ayano-Yui fantasy was a good start ,but you know you want the love triangle!   <br>Ayano x Yui is still supreme.</br>  <br> Yuru Yuri has more confirmed hetero relationships among all characters than homo. </br>  <br><br>How does that bait taste?<br><br><br><br>You say that like your opinion is fact or something.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Thank you, Queen Saku, for saving our thread from oblivion and oppai monsters.</br></br>  You're welcome!  <br> fails to reply <br>Sasuga.</br></br>  <br> Just pretend it didn't happen. </br>  [tsundere noises]<br><br> @_namori_ 11 minutes ago <br><br> コミック百合姫9月号発売日まであと10日ですよ！ゆるゆり情報があれこ<wbr>れ載ってるかも！よろしくお願いします</wbr> </br></br></br></br>  Good night /omrk/<br><br><br> 10 days <br>Can't wait to see what it is</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hnnnng.</br>  I want to marry Chinatsu.

I think she was "hihihi"ing in the 4th episode of Season 1, when she puts up her "mouth to mouth" tanabata.</br></br>  The Keions are really well dressed.<br><br>Pic related, Azunyan looking highly fashionable.</br></br>  <br>That's because she's perfect.</br>    <br>True the keions are /fa/ as fuck</br>  <br><br>Mio's outfit is the best.</br></br>  <br>I like Yui's mod goggles but Mio is best overall, I'd agree.

What would a high school rich ass bitch know about life?</br></br>  Mio a best  <br>My uncle let me drive his boat once when he was really drunk.

Yes they rewrite/add in a lot of liberties, but the overall plot and dialogue isn't really changed.<br><br>They did have to ad-lib some dank moon memes though. ReBirth;1 is on Steam and for about $30, it's a (much more playable) remake of the 1st game, go get it you massive faggot.<br><br> Rebirth;2 has some serious crashing issues on PC, I'd hold off until a sale or they fix it. </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Agreed.<br>Let's see if SL delivers.</br></br>  Obligatory.
