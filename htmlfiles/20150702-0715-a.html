Those mech battles are too sexy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>My god, its like I'm really in 2008</br></br></br>  <br>Quit getting hopes up ep. 4 is three months away. July 4th is only the theatrical release.</br>  <br>What about the PSN rips?</br>  <br>did ep. 3 get a psn rip?</br>       dat scene where suzaku just watches lulu thirst and writhe in pain and he doesn't give a fuck <br>Damn. Still salty about Euphie, eh?</br>  <br>He's salty about Euphemia 2 fucking years from now, so yes he is</br>    <br> Spinzaku still spinning </br>  <br>Of all things related to CG that could've become an internal joke at Sunrise I'm glad this was the thing that stuck.</br>    <br><br><br>Except this picture doesn't make any sense, nor is it all that humorous, because the move was fully legal this time. <br><br>It's a non-joke on the back of an old one.</br></br></br></br></br>   a bunch of gypsies con akito and the troopers to become their work servants <br>Did some Japanese go to Italy this year or what? This literally sounds like what I've heard happens to tourists in Italy.</br>  <br><br>Best part of R2 is the ending.</br></br>  <br>The whole fucking thing was a trainwreck. Really Suzaku should have up and killed himself after that. Literally in his own eyes he should have been irredeemable for killing 35 MILLION people. But they don't really mention this much afterwards- I blame the rush in R2</br>  <br>It's an exact copy-paste of the original, not like it would make much sense anyway, legal or not. It's just a bit of fun.</br>  <br>anti-fun detected</br>  <br>It was a rollercoaster, not a trainwreck. Those have to crash in the end and this stopped well enough. Since you brought another issue up, think about what you're saying: Suzaku couldn't kill himself, remember? "LIVE!" and all. He's literally forbidden from doing anything to kill himself. It could only make him snap instead, which is exactly what happened, and thus the man abandoned the last shreds of his fake ideology. The rush wouldn't change this either way.</br>  Suzaku actually stopped caring about methods when he accidentally the nuke.<br>He went Crazyzaku.</br>  <br><br>There's liking fun because something is funny and there's inserting a meme in a context where it doesn't work.</br></br>  <br>thinken abt cc</br>  <br><br>It was enjoyable, so I can't blame the man here.</br></br>  That tall Japanese guy. He fucked those old women, right?  <br>Filthy gypsies do it everywhere.</br>  <br>Gypsies tend to traffic in human slavery, child sex rings, prostitution rings, etc. What Geass showed is just a romanticized Jap version of an endemic problem</br>  Boobs galore ova  <br>Suzaku also did say that he didn't care what methods he used after selling off Lelouch.</br>  <br> Really Suzaku should have up and killed himself after that <br>The LIVE! geass kinda puts a stop to any and all attempts at suicide.</br></br>  <br>How's he going to kill himself with the Geass effect Lelouch put on him?</br>  <br><br><br>The 'killing himself' thing was just off the top of my head. I meant a sizeable reaction for what he did. He later does his turncoat thing to schneizel, but he never really references what he did, nor anyone else. REAL failure of cause and effect within Geass</br></br></br>  Oh my god, i've been away from /a/ for a while and, /CODEGEASS/ is back?<br><br>dat nostalgia just hit me like freight train. anybody still got the post episode photoshop party pics?</br></br>  <br>The eyepatch alone would have been cool. The eyepatch and the jewel veer into faggotry. I mean, we've always known this is a dangerous tendency for letting Leleouch dress himself, but he looks fucking fruity with that little jewel.<br><br>why not give him visible nipple piercings too while they were at it?</br></br></br>  <br>Viva La Vida - Coldplay.mp3</br>  <br> fucking fruity with that little jewel. <br>That's the point, he is in disguise as a Britannian noble, of course he would want to look fancy</br></br>  <br> He later does his turncoat thing to schneizel, but he never really references what he did, nor anyone else. REAL failure of cause and effect within Geass <br><br>Yet he actually does though. Even gets a monologue in a couple of places. You might need to rewatch a few of those scenes.</br></br></br>  <br> not noble and fabulous </br>  It feels like nothing happened this episode.  <br>Ladies?</br>  <br>Newfag detected.</br>  <br>No anon. They fucked him.</br>  <br>Did we watch the same episode? Story is finally progressing</br>  <br> <br>Next series: Ryou of the Old Gypsies.<br><br>Also I didn't expect that Ryou was such a huge Akito x Leila shipper.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's turned surprisingly bro after their mind meld.</br>  <br><br>Yup. Everyone in the troope is more connected now. They're comrades and friends, so I firmly believe the first part was absolutely necessary to develop a bond. I'm just hoping this won't be a death flag for them. Also, I'm curious of Ayano now 'cause of her blossoming crush for Akito. She reminded me sonewhat of Kallen when she was on Kaminejima with Suzaku.</br></br>  What subs are best?  <br>Official</br>  <br> Oh my god, i've been away from /a/ for a while and, /CODEGEASS/ is back? <br>Kinda, new episode of the OVA miniseries got released.<br><br>Sunrise was on-spot with the fanservice, too</br></br></br></br>  <br>All but confirmed</br>  So CG Photoshop thread?  <br>Its female lelouch<br><br>dont even try to tell me its not</br></br></br>  <br> Its female lelouch <br> dont even try to tell me its not <br>It wouldn't be the first time Lulu dresses like a dancer though I don't remember Lulu having an ass as great as that girl.<br><br>Seems like a cross between Lulu and C.C., though.</br></br></br></br></br>  Half an hour of fucking nothing<br><br>Are they nuts? I swear these guys are just filling in so they can have 4 of these OVA.</br></br>  <br> Half an hour of fucking nothing <br>The real issue being that it was better than pretty much all the rest so far.</br></br>  <br> I swear these guys are just filling in so they can have 4 of these OVA <br>Remember how Unicorn went to shit after episode 4 and the show was extanded from 6 to 7 episodes? Episode 5 was expositionexpositionexposition.</br></br>  have kissanime released it in subs  <br><br>The source material is garbage. There is nothing they can do about it .</br></br>  ha she got raped by old grannies  <br>Why can't gypsy families &amp; their women be like that in my country?</br>  <br>Lelia lost her virginity to the grannies</br>    Dat ass  <br> Why can't gypsy families &amp; their women be like that in my country? <br>You don't live in Spain or France, I assume?</br></br>  <br>They all did.</br>  <br> kissanime <br> streaming </br></br>  <br><br>Gimmie the full pizza, pappa johns</br></br>  <br><br>Please fuck off and never return.</br></br>  That fight at the end of the OVA was excellent. Sunrise knows what we want and they obvious want to keep making more Geass. They just wanted to give him a break and focus on other series.<br><br>It's too obvious there will be another TV series. Maybe Lelouch will have children.</br></br>  <br> lelouch having children <br>With who? Unless he had some between R1 and R2</br></br>  Whats his name /a/?  <br>It's in the filename</br>  Why does he look so different compared to this&gt;<br>. Kyoani would have made a better job</br>  CHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN  This shit of Japanese truck needs to stop, im realy getting tired of it  <br>Why you a hatin ass nigga?</br>   HOONK <br> Great Super STFU <br> bogus license plate  <br><br>Japan knows.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It'll stop once they hit enough little girls to lose momentum.</br>  <br>International Truck Defense Force please go.<br>Tell Optimus he's a faggot.</br></br>  That's awesome, Chen!  <br>Earth is overpopulated, Love eating trucks are necesary.<br>Just think about it like evolution.</br></br>    Do Japanese people seriously pass out when they get a cold? Why are they so weak? Why are colds taken so seriously?   Also, this is now a bad cliche thread.    Damn, 3 windshield wipers? That truck is serious.  Are Japanese so deaf that they can't hear the reving off a four hundred horsepower diesel? <br><br>These things appear like Ninjas in manga.</br></br>  <br>Well duh, mangas are silent. How can you hear the truck coming if it ain't making any sound?</br>  <br>there are many strains of cold. the common japanese cold is vicious  I suppose <br><br><br>its a manga, there's no sound, you cant hear the sounds of the streets, of the city, you dont know how hard it is to hear the truck in that situation<br><br>also if I am understanding the page correctly, its coming out of a tunnel or passage, that could have obscured the sight of the kawaii dead shoujo before she tried to cross in her genki ways</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>aaaand  the legend continues... </br>  <br>Sadly it's a SDFU truck.</br>  <br> That truck is serious. <br>No. It's just Scania.</br></br>  they are listening to eurobeat while driving or what?  Shh, Truck driver is sleeping.  Why is it always a truck? I know that it being bigger conveys the sensation of it being more likely to fucking destroy you, but a regular car would actually be a nice change of pace.  <br>Next chapter never</br>    <br><br>I hope that twat lost his license.<br> passing cars stopped in front of a crosswalk <br>Makes me so mad every time</br></br></br></br>  <br>Those school uniforms are too cute.</br>  <br>loli &gt; trucks</br>  <br>Their nutrition is shit.</br>  Still mad.  Can you survive truck attacks by lying down or are they too low?  Have deadly Japanese trucks ever been parodied in a manga/anime like how running with toast is always parodied these days?  Trucks are especially lethal to onii-chan's who peep on their sisters  <br><br>Depends on the truck itself. Big trucks usually have big enough gap that you can technically lay under it (If you're not crushed by the wheels), but not in Japan where trucks are not physically huge compared to 18 wheelers.</br></br>  Why are trucks still a thing?<br>Those things must have caused more deaths than the Spanish flu.</br>    When will we get to see a truck being run over by a loli?  <br>Check how many people die due to the flu each year by country.</br>    <br>It can't be helped.</br>  <br> That slight homing <br><br>The bloodthirst is real.</br></br></br>  <br>that onii-chan was a scumbag anyway, fucker deserved it</br>  <br><br>and this is why I never trust zebra crossings<br><br>People think they're invincible when they're on them, that's not gonna stop some idiot from crashing into you though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So, why was this guy pulling the wheel onto the loli?</br>  <br>How many people did this truck kill? I can't see anybody surviving on that car on the right.</br>  <br><br>Trying to get back to his own lane probably and didn't notice the fledgling 3dpd</br></br>  And meanwhile, in Russia  <br><br>Probably panicked and tried to swerve out of the way, emphasis on tried.</br></br>  <br><br><br>hes just trying to get back into his lane, they drive on the other side there<br><br>he's still a retard for passing someone at a crosswalk</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Gee, this guy is stopping before a pedestrian crossing, better get ahead of him and go at full speed </br>  <br><br>Probably didn't notice it was a crosswalk, but yeah, still deserves to be shot in the balls.</br></br>  <br>but flu and virus are two different species and effect different cells, along with trigger different immune responses.</br>  <br> Amagami Brilliant Park.webm </br>  <br>What the fuck am I watching.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Wns<wbr>dc7cTPuU</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I'm more worried about the giant falling shoe.</br>  <br>Not today, motherfucker.</br>  <br> Falling shoe <br>It's flying, dunce.

I file my nails regularly, but I still manage to get snags every once in a while. <br><br>I also shave, but I've noticed my face is actually more gentle on the fabric when I have some facial hair, as opposed to the stubble that's left after shaving.</br></br></br>  <br>Griffon.jpg</br>  <br>Anon I can't help someone sucked at their job and decided to fap instead of create properly. <br><br>But really though, I'd say get it, most Gundams and Mechs in general have some pretty good quality for the price. Some don't it's true, but good majority of them do. Though I can guarantee you it wont look like that pic of the Strike Freedom, that's been touched up quite well.</br></br></br>  <br>Sick. How much did all of this run you? <br><br> Thank you for posting about something other than figs; it makes me feel less shitty about owning so few in comparison to BDs and manga. </br></br></br>  <br>Well it's too late now, looks like Amiami sold out.</br>  <br> ふ~ふ <br>I hope you have a heart donor lined up, you'll need that transplant.</br></br>  <br> Stella-rium <br>Nice, I got the Fragments CD instead.</br></br>  Waiting on SAL.  <br> How much did all of this run you?  <br><br>Roughly 14k.<br><br>You shouldn't feel bad, manga and BD's are perfectly valid things to collect, you just can't discuss BD covers as much as you can talk about a good figure.<br><br><br>I am ready.<br><br><br>Good taste.<br><br><br>Max level taste.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why the fuck am I buying SHF Love Lives and not figma. Eli doesn't even look that good.  Wo and Chitoge in stock.<br>Come on Amiko,give me that payment-link.</br>  <br><br>Literally not seeing it</br></br>  Any idea about the date? It's still as simply july everywhere  <br>How the fuck should we know</br>  <br>July 9th<br>Next time, try looking at MFC or Alter's shipment page</br></br>  <br>didn't think about alter, but MFC had it as just july</br>  <br>Outfits and price I'm assuming. The figmas look bwtter though.</br>  I live in US, is EMS worth 2k more yen than SAL? I don't mind waiting 2-3 weeks longer.  Has anyone ever ordered doujin through FJ?<br>I know they typically don't deal with them, but I can't be assed to find another proxy to get them.</br>  is she worth 119 amerifat paperjew slips?  <br>If you don't mind waiting the extra weeks, just go with the SAL.<br>I'm an impatient fuck so I spend the extra 2k.</br></br>  <br><br>Isn't the paint on the keys spotty?</br></br>  <br>Looks fine to me.</br>  I left my figure in unopened for a couple of weeks after I got it, when I opened it the bottom-right shoe had water on it.<br>Do they really melt that fast?</br>  <br>Did you keep it next to the window or something? I've never had any problems with heat</br>    alter chitoge when  <br>Was the figure brand new? It shouldn't happening to a new figure unless you stored it in your oven</br>  <br>Depends on what figure and where you live.<br><br>Could be semen from factory workers.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a bit spotty. Not horrible, but it's definitely the low point of the figure.</br>  How do you buy preorder from some other user in MFC from Amiami?  <br>Under my bed, which is next to the window. It is winter, however; heat would come from the heater which is never on considerably high.</br>  <br>They change the shipping address to your address</br>  <br>Would be easier to ask them</br>  Should I order Steins;Gate Zero now or wait and see if there's a special edition?  The Sakura Figma is pretty nice. Still a Figma, but good for one.  Why does everything I want have to be a GK?<br><br>It's just not fair.</br></br>  <br>It is</br>   Available in 2015 <br>I'm expecting at least an unpainted prototype next wonfes.</br>  <br> that pose <br>I hope you like metal poles</br></br>  <br>still pretty damn nice, even the notes in the eyes are well done, i'm tempted to get her now.</br>  <br> I doubt they'll use that pose. </br>  <br>Are Cospa's Poly Dakis good quality?</br>  Don't know about this one.  <br>Mouse Unit should stick to lolis</br>  <br>Something about Raita's designs in 3D just weirds me out.</br>  <br>it's like someone pressed two silicone blobs onto a flat chest</br>  <br>I'm fine with it for the most part, it's the area just under the tits that looks weird to me. Ribcage. Looks oddly defined.</br>  <br><br> barefoot Miku </br></br>  <br>Who is the Author of that Nagato doujin?<br>I like the cover art</br></br>  <br>To me it's how the breasts are sitting on the ribcage. It just seems wrong.</br>    <br> png <br>JUST</br></br>  <br> Still a Figma, but good for one. <br>You said that like it was a bad thing,<br>figmas are one of he best articulated figures<br>I suspect that scales are your thing, but that doesn't mean that you have to understimate articulated figures<br>OK?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCK</br>  <br>I will never ever fucking understand you troglodytes.</br>  <br>It's probably taken on some mobile device.

It's always a GK.</br>  <br>I have a plan for all the figures I have preordered currently. After that, I'm going to start running into some serious space issues.

I own G4U and can display them with the covers..</br>  Fucking when?  oh shit    <br><br>Looks like they can rotate in their base to point into the star for their group pose, as we somewhat expected.</br></br>  <br><br>How is that going to work with all of them?</br></br>  <br>From the thumbnail, I thought it was a very tiny Azusa next to a huge Mugi</br>    <br>must be one of the bad guys</br>  <br>Rotate them so they are facing forward when pointed together, then you point them all together.<br>I'll probably have them point all together but I'll space them out further so they aren't touching the star.<br>They seem to be placed appropriately on their bases to accommodate space for them to display each other, without blocking view of ones behind it, assuming it's the same with Ritsu/Yui, I'd take it that Mio would need to be the center anyway.</br></br></br>    I'm really like those fat tits of her.  <br><br> rotate <br>Someone's going to break something 5 minutes after they open the box.<br><br>It's a neat idea though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cute, I hope they do Tarou next.</br>  <br>Ignoring the lack of accessories and the disappointing "variation" in face plates, he looks really nice.</br>  <br>It'd be cool if they arranged her twin tails to support her.</br>      <br><br>1/8 when, OR please</br></br>    <br>A shit-eating grin for his mischievous character would have been great. Still, he looks super soft and nice.</br>  <br>Lewd</br>  <br>Too much ass.</br>  <br> I have a plan, most of my stuff is boxed up because I have nowhere to place it besides my closet.</br>  <br>thanks ireland</br>  <br>Not at all.</br>  Waist seems a little small for Illya.  <br>What's the point of loli figures if you're gonna sculpt them like Eiichiro Oda women anyway.</br>  <br>If they had realistic bodies nobody would like them</br>  <br>My dick.</br>  <br>Forgot to link. </br>  <br>Looking at the top half of the lower left image looks like she pulled out a (oversized) knife.</br>  <br>while linking makes things a lot easier to read it's not absolutely mandatory. this one really was obvious from context either way.</br>  <br>Yes, but pointing it out satisfied my autism.</br>  <br>I forgot they come with instruments. Are they all exclusive by the way? might wanna get Yui once she's out</br>  <br>All exclusives</br>  <br>Guess I was wrong in thinking that I had enough Illya figures.</br>  <br> No "odoroita" mustache-glasses <br><br>The wasted opportunities</br></br></br>  <br><br>I need to see it from behind</br></br>  <br>I need to see it from all angles.</br>  <br>I'll be able to order from BiJ right? Never ordered exclusive shit before. That works like a regular order with them but you have to pay upfront, right?</br>  <br>Yes</br>  PROS: In stock now<br>CONS: Has a green spider for hair<br><br>What to do? Anyone bought her?</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br><br>star please be matte transparent</br></br>  <br>Isn't that fanmade? It would've been neat though.</br>  <br>I don't have enough display space to put out everything at once, not with out it looking like clutter, so I just keep a few on display and the rest in their boxes. And after awhile I switch them out.</br>  <br>Has a great ass, but I can't stand that hair wrapped around her leg. It makes no sense for one stand of hair to be coiled around her limb like that.</br>  <br>I shouldn't have to tell you that if the main draw is that she's available you won't be happy</br>  <br>Why would you buy it if you don't like a large part of the figure?</br>  <br><br>Cut it off</br></br>  Enjoy the first of July.  <br>Enjoy July as well.</br>  <br>they're what? 13? girls already got curves at that age. doesn't even require a pedo to appreciate them.</br>  <br>So 80s.</br>  <br>There is no way in hell they're making this. My god.</br>  <br>Bath loli got made.</br>  <br> maybe the wand's shaft is in her anus </br>  <br>I was going to say that prisma is a more reputable franchise than that. Then I remembered mollusks.</br>  <br>can't wait for Kuro.</br>  <br> enjoy everything </br>  <br><br>That's cute. Thanks, yotsubabro.</br></br>   Finally painted <br> that cute ass pout </br>  <br>It's official that he likes to surprise people so they could have done some kind of special face instead just default smiling, attack smiling and closed eye smiling.</br>  <br>I know the post was hours ago but why are there sausages on this anons daki?</br>  <br>Because he likes them  D's </br>  <br><br>They don't even care about miku figures at this point, they know they'll sell like pancakes even if the figure is shit. They might as well use that pose.</br></br>  <br>Why would someone put a 400 dollar figurine in a microwave, even as a joke. Ugh.</br>  <br>What microwave?</br>  <br>Idiot.</br>  <br> ugh <br>Stop posting</br></br>  <br>Was that bait? Oh.</br>  So i've never used a proxy service before, after reading the guide i decided on kolektakon and filled everything out for my order<br><br><br>Just before i hit submit, is there anything should know?<br><br>Am i right in thinking i give them the money upfront at the same time i send the email with my order or did i read it wrong?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Prepare to be jewed</br>  <br><br>The hoodie is cute, but his face plates are really underwhelming. I'll wait for a scale.</br></br>  <br>I'm ready to be jewed in prices but i'm fine with it seeing as how using a proxy is the only way i can get what i want<br><br>I just want to know if i'm doing it correctly and if they're still a fine place to do it with since i know the guide can be outdated in some places</br></br></br>  <br>Don't keep your hopes up, looks like there's ribbons on the left picture. She might be wearing a bra and panties.</br>  <br> slightly visible ribbons <br>BULLSHIT</br></br>  <br><br> sell like pancakes </br></br>  <br>Modern BFC doesn't put much effort into faceplate anymore, especially when they know that they will get the fujobucks even with minimal amounts of giving a shit.</br>  which figures has the best coffee beans<br> excluding bathloli because best is an understatement for that coffee bean  </br>  <br>Is this Peachy Girls?</br>  <br>Source?</br>  <br>...This is Sanya, right?</br>  <br>Yeah now stop staring</br>  <br> tfw no idea what bathloli is  <br>care to post a picture? im highly curious</br></br>  <br> Doesn't know bathloli <br>Just how new do you have to be?</br></br>  <br>Great ass, wonderful thighhighs. Those two aside, I personally love the figure and think it's a nice sculpt and good quality. Tell Your World is also one of, if not my favorite Vocaloid tracks. But like  said, if the fact she's available is the only pro you can think of, you probably shouldn't buy her because you'll end up regretting your purchase.</br>  Tits and Hometown special edition looks nice  <br> just google images bath loli </br>  <br>no it's android 16's posterior</br>  <br><br>Maybe I'll get her included in my order of turbo butt Miku given how she was so massively delayed and apparently out this month.</br></br>  <br>I really, really, really like this Miku.</br>    <br>what is going on on this fig.</br>  <br> &gt;from uk <br> &gt;not aware of bathloli <br> are you a real UKfag? <br>lmao im calling the cops on you nerd</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the 2012 miku is really cute</br>  <br>she has given up on life and decided to shit inside an umbrella for the rainy days</br>  <br>Thank god I don't like loli stuff.</br>    Alter chitoge is now out on HS but not yet on amiami?    <br>am i kawaii uguu</br>    <br> Don't laugh </br>  <br><br>Looks awful.</br></br>  <br>I never said she looked good, seems ok to me, but definitely not worth over 40k</br>  <br>scary hips</br>  <br>http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>144282</wbr></br>    <br>ok now post the coffee beans</br>    <br>Yamato's Amanda Werner.</br>  <br>The big forehead ruins it. It was nowhere near this bad in the original picture.</br>    <br>I never implied you did, I was just stating my opinion. Looks like they are trying to do another Sakura Miku thing but it doesn't work. More red might fix it.</br>  <br>?</br>  <br><br>Thanks doc</br></br>  Oh! The oiled Raita tiger is ponytail version too.  <br>With this coming out, kuro is definitely gonna come out as well</br>  Looks good for a 1500Y prize figure.  <br>Which reminds me, I should probably start watching the Fate series.</br>  <br>Either get the DX edition or don't bother.<br>The standard only comes with one face and its not even coming with an accessory.<br>I love my RAH Miku but the standard edition of this honey whip version is just straight up bullshit.<br>Either get the DX or get the original RAH Miku which is cheap now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know who I like more--Kuro is so sexy and lewd, but Illya is so cute and pure. My dick is going bananas</br>  <br>I like it.<br>Mouth is still shit though.</br></br>  <br>There are versions of her coming from both Max Factory and Flare. Why bother?</br>  Does anyone know how you're supposed to wash these smooth-feeling shirts? I don't even know what it's made out of but it feels similar to a dakimakura  <br>Post a picture of you wearing that shit and I'll tell you.</br>  <br>I know it's an unpopular opinion but I genuinely just don't like Kuro. She was the worst part of Prisma to me. Illya is just too perfect though.</br>  <br>Like a fine swimsuit.</br>  <br>I just put them in the wash with normal clothes and they've come out fine.<br>On a side note, I absolutely hate that material. Does anyone know why asians like printing clothes on it so much? Is it cheaper than printing on normal clothing fabric?</br></br>  <br>maybe it makes you sweat less or the print doesn't wash out as quickly</br>  <br> Does anyone know why asians like printing clothes on it so much?  <br>They do? I didn't even know that this shit existed for normal animu shirts. I always thought that this kind of fabric was reserved for more sport related shirts or sleepwear  or knockoffs. </br></br>    <br>Both are SEGA.</br>  So, I bought the  Solid Snake  Figma off of AmiAmi, and was pretty hype about it, up until last night where I found out that if I preordered with GSC directly, I would've gotten his SOCOM and an extra cardboard box. I've already paid for it, and it's on it way home. Is there any way I could perhaps buy the SOCOM separately? I don't really care as much for the Figma edition box for it, but the SOCOM was kinda the thing that bugged me about missing out on it.  <br>It's the same / similar material to what's used in sportswear. So I'm guessing it makes you sweat less, but i'm pretty sure that isn't the reason.<br><br><br>There are a bunch of people in China that print anime related shirts to sell on sites like ebay / aliexpress and they're almost always made out of that god awful material.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> SEGA <br> 32k anime dollars <br>W-what?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Is there any way I could perhaps buy the SOCOM separately? <br>Nope. You may be able to buy the whole exclusive edition second hand though. Price will be jacked up however.</br></br>  <br>Well, fuck.</br>  <br><br>If the shirt's made of polyester it's more resistant to liquids/stains than if it were made of cotton, which is a good thing for sweaty fat otaku</br></br>  <br>It's probably just dirt cheap. Seems like the most logical reason why that much knock-off shirts use it even when they don't try to emulate some Adidas or Nike jersey.</br>  <br>I really hate how GSC is pretty much pulling retailer specific day 1 dlc with their figmas/nendoroids.</br>  <br> day 1 dlc <br>Take your idiocy back to /v/.</br></br>  <br>I imported that for 30 bucks.</br>  <br>This is the localised version with some different bonuses.</br>  I grabbed this off Amiami. It's banpresto shit, but the first and only sculpt based on Haimura's art.  Anyone considering buying this? I was waiting for this costume and preview looks good. But the price seems too much. Also is Ques Q any good?  Can anything bad happen to my figures if I don't dust them off frequently?<br>The last time was 3 months ago I think.</br>  <br>The dust will solidify and become very difficult to get off.</br>  Super newfag question, hope you don't mind.<br><br>Are there decent figures of Gundams/Mobile Suits out there that aren't gunpla?</br></br>  <br>They will suffocate and die, you better take care of them.</br>  <br>where's their fucking Remi?</br>  <br> is Ques Q any good? <br>No idea, I'd check their figure's MFC pages comment sections to see if there are any complaints, check user photos too.<br>I'm interested in getting their Iona, but I'm holding off on that.</br></br></br>  <br>what</br>  <br> Ques Q </br>  <br>Go look on MFC, I'm not doing the work for you.</br>  <br><br>Man, I'm not really sure if I really want this after seeing the GK version painted. It doesn't look bad, but it just feel like they should have made her 1/6 at least to match the design more, as 1/8 it looks like compacted so to speak.</br></br>  <br>Metal Builds<br>enjoy paying over $300 at least for them</br></br>  <br>honestly I don't care about the scale<br>I really, really want it, but they seem to be slow as fuck with it<br>I don't even think they will bother with other touhouvania figures sadly</br></br></br>  <br>I see. Maybe some day when I win the lottery.<br><br>Thank you.</br></br></br>  When is she coming back?  I want to kill this fucking cunt.<br><br>  <br>Next volume, hopefully.<br><br/></br></br> </br></br>  Reminder that 8man will end up with nobody. He even says it at the end.  <br>replace "genuineness" with any other shonen bullshit like "combat" or "friendship".<br>I sudddenly know why this show is turning into a shitty soap opera.</br></br>  Volume 12 prediction: Iroha will save the club by winning the 8man.  For those that missed it, Enjoyhasu~  <br>Sensei for lyfe.<br>with heaping tons of totsuka dojins</br></br>  The Haruno end is inevitable. Have you learned to deal with that fact yet?  When does the 8bowl end?<br>I want my god of a new world back.</br>  <br>It's hardly a soap opera, I think a lot of people are just upset because the drama at the end of 13 soiled what was starting off as a really touching moment.<br><br>But if you think about it, that's precisely the point. Yui seemed like she was finally opening up to 8man, but then she soiled it with her awful genuine speech gambit purely because she refused to be honest about her feelings.<br><br>The ending is ugly because that's what it was supposed to be.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're trying so hard...</br>  Will this franchise still be relevant by 2017?<br><br>Because 2017 sure is when we'll get the 3rd and final season</br></br>  <br>No, anon, you are being too kind. I don't even try as hard anywhere near as hard as the Irohafags.</br>  <br>It's not a sopa opera because of ugly feelings, it's a soap opera because there's practically nothing BUT muh feelings adn stupid bullshit i could find in any old jrpg.<br>The ending is going to be oreimo or haganai, calling it.</br></br>  I believe Yui fell in love with Hachiman on first sight when he rescued her dog.<br>To her it must have been some fairy tale moment, or a manga fated encounter. And that must be the simple reason why she crushed on him.<br><br>I find that adorable, even if I'm a Yukinofag.</br></br></br>  <br>If you don't like complex emotions and character development feel free to watch another show instead.</br>  I R O H A<br>R<br>O<br>H<br>A</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm feeling good about Iroha's chances but holy fuck almost none of her for an entire volume is suffering.</br>  <br>Are you an idiot or someone who just came in from MAL?<br>or are you just illiterate?</br></br>  Why 8man just not fuck both of them? It would be genuine.  Y A H A L L O<br>A<br>H<br>A<br>L<br>L<br>O</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are you even here? Do you somehow feel fulfilled by copypasting buzzwords in the most inane fashion possible?</br>  <br>MAL then.</br>  <br>I'll take that as a "yes".</br>  <br>why are you the only one here?</br>  <br>/a/ is one person.</br>  Iroha, Totally Not Your Imouto So It's Okay in the Eyes of the Court and God, Isshiki  <br>I especially like how that evolved into a real love on her part over time. From a crush on this creepy, weird guy through the first few three books, to falling for him all over again across the next few books, then finally the last bit of volume 8 where she "confesses" again and tries to comfort him after the twitter gambit. That one scene says so much about how she feels about him now that it's mind-boggling.</br>  <br>Confirmed best</br>  <br>She did disappear for half the volume, but look at it this way.<br>The few scenes that she got were very good ones, 8man even dropped the romcom cliche "嫌いじゃないけど" on her.<br><br>Though, I don't think anyone will win in just one volume, if vol 12 is indeed the last.</br></br></br></br>  Yuigahamama will win the 8bowl. Mark my words.  Did Spyro really kill himself?

What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a b-boyfriend..." <br> Blushes and bits her tongue <br> She is late to the date because she didn't get the train and preferred to save the money for the stylish cafe <br><br> the cutest delusion </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah it's really sad because we all know that's how it's gonna end.</br></br>  <br><br>Yui should win him first so that she could reel him in.</br></br>  <br>I think her disappearing is good for her. If she had any status quo filler scenes it would undermine the significance of her valentine's scenes.<br><br>The fact that she disappeared until the next volume in all likelihood means that Watari has something big to capitalize on it when she shows up next volume.<br><br>Really, the fact she disappeared is actually good for her. It just sucks to have to wait 6+ months to get the payoff.</br></br></br></br></br>  Yui's VA<br> 結衣の中には「私を置いていかないで」って泣き叫びたいくらいの気持ちは<wbr>きっとあったと思うんですよ。</wbr> <br> それを自分なりに整理して、最終話で穏やかな言葉として発している。 <br> でもそこで雪乃と八幡の通じ合うようなやりとりを目の当たりにするんです<wbr>。</wbr> <br> 分かってはいたんだけど、やっぱり辛いですよね。 </br></br></br></br>  <br>It's runes.</br>  <br>Ouch, not even her VA has faith in her.</br>  <br>Translation?</br>  <br> The fact that she disappeared until the next volume in all likelihood means that Watari has something big to capitalize on it when she shows up next volume. <br>Fucking bullshit<br><br>Watari probably already write a kohai fap fiction called 11.5<br><br>All the spotlight distribution is so fucking unfair, and I'm not even Y&amp;Yfag</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> kohai fap fiction called 11.5 <br>I'm okay with that.</br></br>  <br>Nah, his kouhai fap fiction is going to be volume 13.</br>  <br>Reminder, Hikki was playing penguins with her way before Vol. 11<br><br> 90% a coincidence, but hey, one can hope... </br></br></br>  <br>While I appreciate the effort, you gotta remember this is an English image board, anon, and not everyone has taken the time to learn glorious nipponese.</br>  Y'know I am a Yukinofag myself, buuuuutt if you think like rationally, the only way the Club won't break would be Irohaend or nooot????  <br> でもそこで雪乃と八幡の通じ合うようなやりとりを目の当たりにするんです<wbr>。</wbr> <br><br> GT: But where Yukino and I got to witness the exchanges like each other through the Yahata. <br><br>What does she said?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It would be hilarious if WW really wrote another sidestory for Iroha.<br><br> Too bad that would mean Iroha can't win. </br></br></br>  <br>Iroha poorfag theory 1/3<br><br>Vol 8 ch 2<br> Her uniform looked slightly worn out and she was slightly squeezing the cuffs of her cardigan that was somewhat rugged. <br><br>Vol 9 ch 7 <br> “Is this really oookay?

Also, fundraisers are a complete no for me.” <br> “The latter reason is completely self-centered…” <br> Yukinoshita let out an amazed sigh. But look here, Yukinon! Gahama-san and Iroha are both nodding their heads, see! If we were to do a fundraiser, according to my rough mental calculations, at worse we’d need at least 5,000 yen per person… That’s impossible… This amount was something I might’ve been able to procure if I cried to my parents, but if I had to pay for something like this, I might as well use that money to destroy the event in its entirety instead. Besides, there was the possibility that we'd have to raise even more money from here on. <br> With the issue of money finally becoming more realistic, the others in the student council looked at each other. And the one in that group with the most reluctant face was Isshiki. Good grief, this girl was really… <br><br>Ch 10 <br> “But, as I thought, it’s still one dollar and eighty-seven cents. The next day is Christmas too.” <br> I recalled this opening scene from somewhere. <br> Amongst the numerous books that were given to Isshiki from Yukinoshita, the one she chose was called “The Gift of the Magi” <br><br> I tried to throw the tinsels and ornaments away, but I was denied the chance because Isshiki suggested that they might come in handy again in the future. That’s called being a hoarder, you know… </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The other way around, anon. The only way to get Iroha end would be to break the club.</br>  <br>I'm starting to think that the LN was even more damning toward the club than the anime was.<br><br>I doubt Spyro would be so vocally depressed about his ship, as though it's already been sunk, if the anime really conveyed to us how bad things are for them.</br></br></br>  <br><br>8man already remembered her birthday and foreshadow April in v11.<br>We are in the mid of february and each volume seem to be 1month in length in the yahari universe.

Well, Comiket’s been the focus on television and special programs recently, so it wouldn’t be strange to know about its existence. <br> However, Isshiki seemed to have a one-sided understanding of it. <br> “Isn’t it, like, a place where you can make loooads of money?” She asked, leaning slightly forward in keen interest with sparkling eyes.  <br><br> “S-Senpai, pl-please wait a moment.” <br> Isshiki’s voice was trembling when she stopped my hand. <br>“Wh-What’s wrong?” I asked.<br> Going “Mm! Mm!”, Isshiki wagged the tip of her finger and pointed at the screen. <br>“Look at this! Look!”<br> What’s the deal…? I thought. When I looked, she was pointing at a comment made by an employee from a certain publisher. He introduced himself and provided information on his job: the university he graduated from, what his job entailed, an approximate time schedule of one working day a week, and so forth. As I followed the lines one by one, my eyes stopped at one. <br> “A salary of ten million yen at age twenty five…” <br> I sat there trembling in shock and I could hear deep breathing noises from behind. When I turned around, Isshiki placed her left hand to her cheek and showed a sweet and poppy smile. “I’m going to marry a publishing editor.” <br><br> “Well, isn’t having some kind of goal in itself a good thing? I’ve been trying hard everyday towards my goal since a while ago, after all.” <br> “Hoh, a goal…” I gave Isshiki a scrutinizing glance to see what she truly meant when she had uttered something so unlike her. <br> But there, she placed her index finger to her chin and tilted her head. “Of course, I plan on retiring after several years by getting married, you know?” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't need to be a .5 volume at all.<br>Iroha's birthday is coming up and volume 12 could cover up to that, if Watari so chooses.<br>Also,<br> inb4 8man gives Iroha choco back during white day but not to any of the club members because of drama </br></br></br></br>  <br>Poorfag confirmed</br>  <br>Get burned noob</br>  <br>And that makes it worse<br><br>yet another fap garbage where one side get all the drama and another get all the romantic development</br></br></br>  <br>translate note: 5000 yen is around 320 Norwegian krone.

I was really hoping I could put the things from before under our expenses.” <br> “Oh no… That’s not good… Umm, isn’t that, like, really bad?” <br> Isshiki groaned and fell forward on her desk. She slowly turned her head towards me and her eyes were slightly cloudy. Right after, she murmured in a small voice, “The expenses! The discount! The extra charges! Over the budget! The account expenditures!” and shook. <br><br>Vol 11<br> Yui-senpai. Cooking is all about sincerity. The most important thing in homemade cooking is kindness and feelings. Thoughts about your partner lead the way to the progress. Because your partner is a guy who knows nothing about pastry making.So handmade is easy-peasy.

That's called chemistry, it's natural and doesn't require one side trying to forcefully make it work somehow.</br></br></br>  <br> sennheiser hd 589  <br>top taste</br></br>  <br>Welcome to the moral of the story.</br>  <br><br><br>Huh, so she really is a poorfag.<br>I guess that explains a big part of her shallow crush on Hayama, who is a filthy rich cunt.<br><br>There's just no fucking way to dislike Iroha anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's not her fault <br>I never blame Iroha, but the duality of the storytelling and bias.<br><br>This me speaking as orimotofag, which literally exist as plot device, and I can accept that. But how Watamote handle the 'Main heroines' seriously fucked up.<br><br> That's called chemistry, it's natural and doesn't require one side trying to forcefully make it work somehow. <br>And? the chemistry that exist in early volumes between 8man and Y&amp;Y was GONE because Watari can't be arsed to make a proper balance for everything.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Amongst the numerous books that were given to Isshiki from Yukinoshita, the one she chose was called “The Gift of the Magi” <br><br> short story about a young married couple and how they deal with the challenge of buying secret Christmas gifts for each other with very little money.  <br><br>I wonder why did Iroha choose this one</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice association fallacy.</br>  <br> I never blame Iroha, but the duality of the storytelling and bias. <br> This me speaking as orimotofag, which literally exist as plot device, and I can accept that. But how Watamote handle the 'Main heroines' seriously fucked up. <br>Fair enough, but ever since the themes of being shallow and fake came up at the field trip, double YY and 8man just couldn't keep their shit together.<br>It's not that it's purposefully bias or anything, but it does look like it is sometimes.<br><br> And? the chemistry that exist in early volumes between 8man and Y&amp;Y was GONE because Watari can't be arsed to make a proper balance for everything. <br>Their chemistry is gone because the girls started wanting something that would break the club's balance, and because of that they started to pretend that it wasn't there and 8man went along with it.<br><br>Hell, even 8man himself realized that the way things are going in the club won't allow a happy ending. But if that's what it takes for him to find what he wants, then so be it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So now it's pretty much confirmed that Iroha is in fact a poorfag. Let us speculate why did Watari made that setting? Too complicated for a side character that appear too late in the story. It's maybe more understandable if he changed his intention in later novel and added more details in later novel, but since the hint appear as soon as volume 8, I think he was planning something.  <br><br><br>I'm starting to think Watari's intention is to write her almost entirely out of subtext.<br><br>In that case even if she wins a big ending for her is unlikely. Even if she wins it'll just be a really light confirmation (holding hands in the epilogue) or no confirmation and all with strong implying implications.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice fallacy fallacy.</br>  <br>Can't really say anything because we're already done with volume 11.<br>But she and 8man do share some things, both of them dislike working and want to find a good partner that will allow them to stay home all day, yet both of them can and do handle work surprisingly well.</br></br>  <br>"Not all suffering is genuine"<br>"The service club is suffering"<br>"it must not be genuine"<br><br>literally textbook.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But how Watamote handle the 'Main heroines' seriously fucked up. <br>I don't see plotholes or thematic inconsistencies, on what grounds can you call it fucked up? There's no law of fiction that states heroines must be used in the most orthodox fashion possible.<br><br> And? the chemistry that exist in early volumes between 8man and Y&amp;Y <br>What chemistry? If they had good chemistry they wouldn't be in this mess to begin with, plain and simple.<br><br>The club situation is purely the result of incompatibilities in their personalities.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice strawman. I never implied anything but the first.</br>  Irohasu~  Reminder for all Yukinofags that there are far more superior version of Yukino  <br>It probably ties in with the final moral of the story.<br><br>8man has a dramatic relationship with the club and cares about them, but he also has friends/family he cares about without the drama.<br><br>Iroha's basically one of the latter in the form of a love interest.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Correction: I never implied anything but the first two.</br>  <br> complex emotions and character development </br>  <br>Why do you keep doing this to me?</br>  <br> commie </br>  <br>the third is the obvious implication of claiming "you can't call something genuine just because it makes you suffer" to be the moral of the story. Now you're just pretending it wasn't because I called your bullshit.</br>  <br>the third is wrong in the first place<br>you should stop typing and move on</br></br>  <br>Yes the third statement is wrong, thank you for agreeing with my original point.</br>  <br> Her apron during the event is white without any detail. Looks plain and cheap (even though she looks hella cute) <br>Forgot to say that this one was just my personal opinion, haven't read the translated text about that choco making scene yet</br></br>  <br>Wrong. The obvious implication is "the club may not be genuine".<br><br>Making a strawman isn't calling anyone out on anything. It just shows you don't have a position, so you have to make up one to argue against.</br></br></br>  <br>To clarify: The implication of sensei's statement is "the club may not be genuine".<br><br>I believe the club isn't genuine, and that's going to be the moral, however I have never claimed that it's -because- they're suffering that the club isn't genuine.<br><br>It's the opposite really, the club's non-genuineness is what's causing a lot of their suffering.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>splitting hairs between "is" and "may not be" means nothing when the only way to bear out your supposed "moral" is for the club to prove not genuine.</br>  <br>The club already proved that it's not genuine in volume 11, in case you haven't noticed.</br>  <br>The club isn't genuine at all.<br>Look at double Y, they arent acting naturally at all.<br>All of them are wrecking their head trying to be "genuine" just so they can impress 8man and fit his genuine ideal.<br><br>They are a bunch of fakers.</br></br></br></br></br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!  <br>if she's so poor why does she waste her money buying bags of snacks each day</br>  <br>It's not that they're trying to impress him, more that they feel so inferior that they can't do anything without him backing it.<br><br>The club's problems are deeply entrenched in the fact that all three members have serious social issues.</br></br></br>  <br>Written off as StuCo expenses.<br>So she's not wasting her money at all.</br></br>  <br>StuCo money for the christmas event.</br>  <br><br>ah ok, I stand corrected</br></br>  <br>While I dont buy the samefag poorfag posts, those were expensed most likely.

He's fucking awful.  <br>most people don't realize that the real bowl is the komachi-bowl<br>whoever gets 8man gets her in the end</br></br>  <br>Because he's the MC of a romcom.<br>Although, the romcom part is only being kept alive by one character.</br></br>  Here's a list of all interesting Iroha vids on Nico.<br>For those that don't know how to use jap Nico or don't bother to.<br>http://pastebin.com/meEsfDWW<br>Enjoyhasu~</br></br></br>  Irohasu~  <br>Dr いろはす is fucking good</br>  Hachiman, like most harem MCs, is not really a good catch, but what can you do?

Only inertia is keeping me coming to these threads I think.<br><br>I'm more convinced than ever of a friendship end with no one getting Hachiman. And where's the fun in that?

From the anime, everybody else were wearing colorful aprons with stamping, while hers was just plain white</br>  <br>Oh just fuck off. It's haremshit and she has interest in another guy. She's shit and should have her skin peeled off in sections.</br>  <br><br>Her sluttyness is part of her appeal, for me.</br></br>  <br>Anon, you ever watched a soap opera? They're full of murder, amnesia, pregnancies, incestual adultery and other crazy garbage. Any show that deals primarily with relationships isn't a fucking soap.</br>  Does Yui's friends (Yumiko and Ebina) support Hachiman x Yui?  <br>No, I mean I believe in friendship end. Whether one of Y won, Iroha won whatever, or even loner end.<br><br>They CAN rebuild broken ties, that's the whole message of this clusterfuck. Just because you fuck up doesn't mean you can't start over, that's what it meant to be youth.<br><br>  inb4 8man rant about youth being not genuine <br>He's changing</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>Ebina probably.<br>Yumiko no, she knows she's going to end up getting hurt.</br></br>  <br> I'm more convinced than ever of a friendship end with no one getting Hachiman <br>Friendsip is shit, love is all.</br></br>  <br>Miura probably does. She seemed extremely nonchalant about it when mentioning it in Kyoto, and her opinion of 8man has only improved since then.</br>  <br> 35 <br>Name of the song/artist?</br></br>  <br> I'm Canadian <br>My condolences</br></br>  <br>Are you Canadian too?</br>  <br><br>Yeah yeah. Things get bad but then you repair and restore your relationships. No one really thought there wouldn't be drama on the way. But they were always going to end the series as friends.<br><br>But if that's all we get, this whole thing was a giant waste of time. To have an outcome consisting only of what we already knew. The sweet words aren't enough.<br><br>Some HAS to end up with Hachiman. I don't particularly care who. Even Iroha whom I utterly despise. I would take an Iroha end over friendship only.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The truth about the Hayamakiller. </br>  <br>Hard to tell with Miura. She seems to reject the diea that Yui could actually like 8man. But that was when she didn't really like 8man aherself, he seems to have grown on her so she'd probably be more accepting of it now<br><br>Ebina would start lamenting the death of HayaHachi but you'd know that deep down she was happy for Yui</br></br></br>  <br>Mah nigga</br>  <br>Yumiko? Not really.  She wants the 8 for herself </br>  <br>I honestly wouldn't worry about it. People who think friendship end will happen forget the central conciet that to be genuine you have to be willing to hurt the people you love. "Just friends" means all three main characters are still refusing to act on their own feelings because they're afraid to hurt each other.<br><br>If they really are genuine about how they feel, 8man will pick one of the girls, the other will accept that, and the three of them will carry on because their friendship does mean more to them than 8man's dick.</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry I don't know.<br>Scoured over the description, comments, and video and no mention of it.<br>But at least by reading the description I found out that the creator of the video is an Irohafag.<br> Irohasu was especially cute </br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean, we still don't really know the exact nature of 8man's feelings. Obviously there's SOME level of romantic attraction, we wouldn't be getting all this spaghetti drama if he didn't like either of them. But that doesn't necessarily mean he'd actually be interested in a relationship with either of them. Or maybe it'll turn out that his feelings for Yukino weren't "genuine" after all (though that would be pretty dumb honestly)<br><br>I agree that romance end is most likely at this point, but he could still reject both of them and not have it be an asspull. If he does, though, it's going to be because he actually doesn't want a relationship, not him choosing not to act on his feelings to try and preserve their friendship. If it came down to that I think he'd actually rather just end up a loner again.</br></br></br>  left one is going to suck on your dick and call you cute and fun<br><br>right one is going to step on your dick and call you creep and pervert<br><br>left or right /a/?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I choose to be in the center</br>  <br><br>Can I get right to do what left's doing?<br><br>She can do what she was going to do after that I don't mind.</br></br></br></br>  How did that turn out?

S1 has its moments though.</br></br>  Dumping some Isshiki<br><br>1/6</br></br>  <br> If you think about all the efforts for the sake of making Hayama eat chocolate, this dedication is quite admirable.  <br> Well, if you dismiss that dark scheming about low price of obligated chocolate, apron on top of uniform gives it's effect.  <br> One can see how that schemes mysteriously turn into amusing effort. <br> Heed my words.  <br> Apron on top of uniform &gt; naked apron! <br> But Komachi in apron on top of sleeveless shorts is just the best. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>2/6</br>  <br>What the actual fuck.<br>Are those the translations ?<br><br>How the fuck does he make those connections in his mind? Just fuck already.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He didn't got the girl? Will there a third season?</br>  <br>Pretty sure "not wanting a relationship" is still pretty far outside the realm of possibility, even if it's not nearly as ridiculous as "we'd rather not risk our friendships for love."<br><br>The only reason he's avoided a relationship thus far is because he's afraid of misreading girls' intentions and getting hurt like he did in middle school. Once you get 8man past that, he's got no other discernible reason to not end up with Yukino or Yui.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah. It's no way Yukinon would suck on your dick - even after marriage. She would call it smelly and creepy.</br>  <br> There are people who expected 8man to end up with someone in S2 </br>  <br> He didn't got the girl?  <br>No, it's worse<br> Will there a third season? <br>Possible, but still uncertain.

But I am seriously disappointed with Watari and Volume 11. It has made me sad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Just finished watching season 2. They're really pushing Yui aren't they?<br><br>Yui is the hot new shit, Yuki gets left in the dirt.</br></br>  Anyone got that image panel of Yukino in chibi/moe form? Has an image where her cheeks are being squeezed  O T P<br>T<br>P</br></br>  <br><br>Eh, it'll get better for it. We knew her problems were there and coming. Vol. 11 is just when they really struck hard.<br><br>Watari is a good writer but he does have a tendency to exaggerate things. The tension in the Service Club carried on too far long from false confession to GENUINE. Which in anime terms made a large part of S2 depressing. Yukino's problems seem insurmountably bleak in vol. 11 but I'm guessing he didn't actually intend for her to seem that helpless and destroyed. So she'll recover a lot faster than people expect and then they'll complain about that being unrealistic.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I really like the plain white apron. It makes her look like a professional.</br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/uBKfIaOczK4?list=P<wbr>LAl1jyoxo8aJgC3QQiZ8iRh71u1OnQ6iT</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>This track is how I feel about Yukino in volume 11 right now. These dark times have never gotten so dark.</br></br></br>  <br>This is all I got. I hope it fills the hole in your heart.</br>  <br>I just hope 8man can make the Ice Queen return.</br>  <br> new </br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br>Yukinon a poop.</br>  <br>F A C A D E<br>A<br>C<br>A<br>D<br>E</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So the mini-volumes are all we're getting with the BDs then? No .5 OVAs?  But really vol. 11 is meant to be an adjustment of sorts for Yukino. At least in romantic terms with Hachiman.<br><br>She had a ton of momentum coming in even though warning signs were starting to pop up in vol 10. Then shit hits the fan in vol 11 and now it's become much more uncertain about what her end game is going to be. Both regarding Hachiman and her own issues/future.</br></br>  <br>I'm sure you watched a different show.</br>   She will never bite your dick off.   <br>Both forms will combine into the ultimate form.</br>  <br>don't stop now</br>   Iroha Bday is April 16 <br> Hachiman's bday is August 8 (one year older than Iroha) <br><br>The difference between them is 8 months and 8 days. <br><br>Wtf</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lel</br>  <br>Not him but I still want to second the general "stay positive, Yukibros" attitude. I feel for all of you that are despairing right now, but I'm certain it's just because of the shock of her sudden change, and that prevents you from seeing things clearly right now because of how invested you are in her.<br><br>But from an outside perspective I can tell you that it definitely looks good for Yukino's future. Not to deny the road ahead is still rocky, but the end of the line will be all the more worth it for that.</br></br></br>  Is Sensei God? Why does she know everything?  <br><br>3/6<br><br> Sorry, was too busy fapping. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Illuminati confirmed.</br>  Why is 8man so much more handsome in s2? He doesn't look like that much of rapist anymore.  <br>Hiratsuka probably went through the same thing they're going through in the past.</br>  <br>4/6</br>  <br>All we need is this to be playing when they become a couple by the time the series ends (OVA when).

Lots of moments hat in other stories would lead to some large cathartic moment between the SC, but here were basically just resolved through some emotional honesty. Like if you compare 8man/Yukino's interactions when he found out her car was the one that hit him, vs the itneractions between the club after the confession, and how those problems were actually resolved, you can definitely tell that S2 is just a lot more "dramatised" or melodramatic than S1.<br><br>Neither style is necessarily a bad thing, but it's a little jarring moving from one to the other in the same story</br></br></br>  <br> but I don't see anything other than suffering for her for last six volumes <br>What?</br></br>  <br>T-that's just coincidence, WW wouldn't be so obvious, right?</br>  <br>Well it took an entire Volume for Yui to just pull even with a moeblob dependent Yukinoshita and Vol 12 should be when Yuki finally undergoes positive character growth (unless Watari decides to add something else to her list of problems...)<br><br>It'll be a long few months but stay strong.

The only other moment 8man hurt her was when he took his hand away during the genuine speech, and then she thought he was refusing to chase after Yukino.<br><br><br>I'd say telling her to solve her own problems was a fulfillment of her request, just in a roundabout way.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She didn't really ask him for help yet so we don't really know<br>Until we know what her request actually is it's hard to tell</br></br>  <br>8man would never reject something like that.

Rewatching episode 12 again was a big downer.  <br>Honestly if 8man ends up happy then I'm happy</br>  <br>"chemistry" is literally a buzzword. It's intentionally vague and used as a catch-all for the undefined qualities of a bond between two people.<br><br>Every protagonist to ever have more than one girl after his dick has chemistry with every last one of them, otherwise they wouldn't be interested in each other. Trying to use it as some sort of measuring stick just shows how desperate you are to convince yourself Iroha will win.</br></br></br>  Yukino's face her always gets me<br><br>I can deal with all the other sad faces, but just how completely terrified she looks here is heartbreaking</br></br>  <br>I know this has nothing to do with what you said, but the ribbons in her hair or whatever really bother me.</br>  <br>Now that's ice queen.</br>  <br> I really don't get the feeling that 8man is in love with any of these girls <br>Neither do I. I don't see him being in love with either yet. <br><br>However, it's clear that 8man is at least aware of the girls, if not attracted (romantically of course) judging by his inner thoughts and his shy moments. That isn't too far from love. Add some developments in vol. 12 and 13, fix 8man's personality, and WW can have him having a chessy monologue in the line of how the "genuine thing" has always been around him, just that he didn't realize it. Now he is rehabilitated from his old cynical edgy self, he can see how the chosen girl has always been there, but he tried to turn his eyes away from reality to look for the his ideal, yet wrong idea of "genuine". blahblah. BAM, feelings upgrade from attracted to love. <br><br>Wouldn't feel too forced, I *think*. There are already enough hints to get to conclusion that 8man is attracted to one of the 3 girls (Yui, Yukino, Iroha) if we need to.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But there, she placed her index finger to her chin and tilted her head. “Of course, I plan on retiring after several years by getting married, you know?” </br>  <br>I excpected NTR conclusion of some kind, but the S2 ended without it ;_;</br>  <br>I wonder what exactly was going through her mind at that moment.<br><br><br>It's an accessory, they aren't meant to be practical.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly if Iroha ends up happy then I'm happy</br>  <br> what do you mean he's 8 inches? </br>  <br> I wonder what exactly was going through her mind at that moment. <br>Nothing but spaghetti.</br></br>  <br>Spyro? You mean Excorsism, right? Spyro is simply the sheep to Excorsism sheepard.</br>  <br> I want to give him chocolates <br> What do I do..... <br> Dont leave me Yuigahama-san..... </br></br></br>  <br> Yui or Yukino end: Most people accept it. <br> Friendship end: middle ground with some people pissed off and some accepting it. <br> Iroha end: A month of accelspam: seeenpai~ edition </br></br></br>  <br> "I mean he's 8 inches in thickness." </br>  <br>Friendship end would piss off everybody except one or two kooks who legitimately want/expect it to happen.<br><br>Also the least genuine end by MILES.</br></br></br>    <br>"Chemistry" just means how well they interact, really. Honestly, I prefer Yukino's chemistry with 8man to Iroha's. She was basically the only person he could interact with back then without completely sperging out, even if it was mostly just throwing insults at each other.<br><br>I actually find Iroha's flirting to be the weakest part of her interactions with 8man. Their other interactions are fine and entertaining, and even her mock rejections are still pretty funny. But all the ship-teasy moments just feel like something out of a much worse story.</br></br></br>  <br>No she just a looks like retard. It's normal for autistic girl.</br>  <br>Good god, this bait is wrong as expected.</br>  <br>Why can't Japanese women find husbands? Is It because Japanese businessmen would rather fuck 13 year old prostitutes?</br>  <br>This. Friendship end is a cop out and if WW does it he basically ignores a shit ton of development</br>  <br>She actually  has a really big clitoris which scares away all the men. </br>  <br>I want to Yahallo her Yuis.</br>  <br>Thank you for your work, typesetter-kun.<br><br>Hopefully this is readable, I had to make some changes in it's size because of the ten thousand pixel limit.</br></br></br>  If Yui or Yukinoshita are going to win, why has WW been writing Iroha as the third love interest?  <br>This is truly what the webm format was created for.</br>  <br>To tease shippers like you</br>  <br>To make the girls realize they have to make a move soon. Also the $$$</br>  <br>Not an Irohafag, but I'd rather take an Iroha end over friendship end anytime. Friendship end just feel like a cop out when WW doesn't dare to commit to a side of the shipping war.<br><br>Just remind me to stay away from OregaIru threads if it's actually turn out to be Iroha end by some tiny chances.</br></br></br>  <br> being this retarded </br>  <br>Yet she always bought all the food for the meetings for the Christmas event.</br>  <br>Cool, thanks for that. <br><br>More translated fanart here:<br> http://pastebin.com/dJas1C5B </br></br></br></br>  <br>double YY fanbase : plot device, comedy relief<br>Iroha fanbase : romantic comedy, unlikely victory</br></br>  <br>That's another good way to define it, but that definition is still pretty open, which is mostly my point. Yukino's chemistry is in their easy banter, Yui's is in how she can understand and support 8man, and Iroha's is in how well she can push his buttons. They all work well with him, just in different ways.</br>  <br> &gt;But Komachi in apron on top of sleeveless shorts is just the best. <br><br>Did he just imagine his sister naked in a "legit" way?<br><br>Sleeveless top and shorts would be hidden behind an apron.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> He doesn't choose Yui and Yukinio <br><br>No way Iroha would pass that up.<br><br> He doesn't choose anyone <br><br>Sensei is getting married.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See </br>  <br>Scaring YY into action and possibly as a sacrificial lamb for trying to win 8man with sly instead of just playing it straight.</br>  <br> komachi <br>This is it, Iroha is officially never escaping the imoutozone.</br></br>  <br><br>8 &amp; 8</br></br>  So Hayama is totally boning Yukinon's sister, right?  <br>The imoutozone that he wants to fuck.</br>  <br>He wants a fuckable sister</br>  <br>Fate/Stay Mad</br>  <br>If he really wanted to fuck an imouto he'd risk the social stigma for the obviously superior one.</br>  <br><br>Yui bisexual?</br></br>  <br>He didn't mention the top, just the sleeveless shorts.</br>  <br>If by boning you mean staying in a closet with a mouthgag and his hands and legs tied up while he watches/hears haruno fuck strangers then yes</br>  <br>3P best end.</br>  <br>Letting out your frustration?</br>  <br>...as opposed to shorts with sleeves?</br>  <br>let's not pretend that hayama isn't a cuck</br>  What will Yukino's request be?  <br>I want Yui to win the 8bowl and then tell Yukino how amazing it's to have sex with 8inch</br>  <br> http://pastebin.com/dJas1C5B <br><br>Yui 26 isn't finished?</br></br></br>  <br>Yui26 is only a single page though?</br>  <br> "I know isn't it?" <br> . <br>ensuing cat fight</br></br></br>  <br> ノースリーブショートパンツ <br> Sleveless short pants <br>Dunno, maybe he really meant sleeveless top with short pants</br></br></br>  I'm missing her already.

There shouldn't exist any antagonism directed at Haruno; she believe her method is efficient.<br><br>So, what is the difference between Hachiman saying "Solve her own problems" and Haruno saying "Figure it out yourself" directed at Yukino? It seem to me you anons convientely want to associate a character as the villian.<br><br>Every Oregairu character are cunts, not only Haruno.<br><br>Please treat Haruno kindly and do not dehumanize Haruno.

His goal was to be a house-husband. <br> However, his butler-spirit had already awakened. After the True End of Rin route, he was working part-time at the mansion of Rin's rival. What the heck is this? <br> At the finale, he was still half-baked as a magus, but he had made immense progress as a spellcaster.  <br><br>For three years he was making meals for her and spending time with her every day at work, and eventually they bonded.<br><br>It's confirmed they did some other stuff together, like hunt vampires or solve magic mysteries. It's how Luvia got the nickname "Poppins in July" or something? Since she fell down a chimney when they were chasing something down once through the rooftops.<br><br>So far she's probably the only other one in London save for Rin who supposedly knows Shirou is a heretic but keeps it secret.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How is he a heretic.</br>    <br>Did you even read the game? It's an entire thing that if he ever revealed his magecraft in front of a proper magus he'd be sealed and his brain would be dissected pretty quickly.<br><br>Rin, Sakura, and Luvia are the exceptions since they're an atypical new breed of magus that puts feelings over results.</br></br></br>  <br> Shirou's classic 'you lost me' face </br>  <br> stitching <br>I didn't know he did that. Is this ever mentioned outside of what you posted?</br></br>  <br> Not seeing what girls see in Shirou <br>He is the definition of best boy.</br></br>  <br>The basics are, he cannot use projection, strengthening, or any other magecraft aside from one in truth.<br><br>Though they may superficially appear like those things, they're in truth something very different, and abide by none of the real rules of those magics.<br><br>The only magic he can use is his reality marble, and his reality marble makes him a heretic for several reasons. Blah blah, there's an entire explanation to this and then some, but his magic is something only he can do in the end. Something outside of what any other magus can do with training. It doesn't mean his magic is super duper powerful, all three heroines are probably stronger than him, but his magic is something that would net him a sealing designation.</br></br></br></br></br>  What kind of name is Luviagelita?  <br> tfw no Luvia route </br>  <br>He's a devoted housekeeping bodybuilder who can FUCKING COOK.<br><br>What in god's name else do you want?</br></br></br>  <br>Someone who isn't a manchild and has a proper job.</br>  <br>Don't say it anon.

She just wants an excuse to flirt with him.  <br>Watched Lancer's Gae bolCar in the suggestions "LANCER DIED" "YOU BASTARD" Never picked up before.</br>  <br>based</br>  <br>Why does she seem like the opposite in Prisma?</br>  <br>She knows how to fake otherwise. In Prisma you're not looking through her eyes anymore.</br>    <br>I wouldn't use Prisma as a comparison. The author doesn't have a very good grasp of any of Nasu's characters' personalities, or if he does, he purposely goes completely different ways with them.<br><br>His Kid-Gil is nothing like Nasu's Kid-Gil for one. Nasu's Kid-Gil never calls anyone "mongrel", nor would he ever laugh maliciously. He's a well-behaved young boy who just happens to have a few adult tastes.</br></br></br>  how powerful is luvia? can she outclass rin? if there are factors for summoning garcher, could she?  <br>It's no use dude. The managaka himself even tried to get people to realize Prisma isn't canon. People will still use it as if it is forever.</br>  <br>To be fair, Nasu's now calling it the official Ilya route, and seems to have a lot of respect for it. He compared it to the Tsukihime manga, which he has raved about for years.</br>  <br> Nose <br><br>Where?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>there is also this one</br></br></br>  <br>Is the blonde dude Hephaestion?</br>  <br>He also was all like "what the fuck did you do to Bazette". In neither case was he particularly serious.<br><br>Point is it was fun doujin series that got funded to be a published manga because it's fun and Nasu likes money. Nothing in it has anything to do with anything else.</br></br></br>  <br>Nasu is being lazy trying to get out writing an Illya route</br>  <br><br><br>I hope I don't grow tired of these, because for the moment, I am loving them.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah he got bazette powerlevel wrong in part 2 and part 3 she got nerved</br>  <br>How does that work? Does it have to be posted before being baited?<br><br>Oh, and we need Baitzett's don't answerer.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Funny, I thought his reality marble would make him servant tier when it comes to battle strength.</br></br>  <br>wasn't kerry's time alter like a reality marble manifested in his own body? it wasn't all that amazing either</br>  <br>Well, he is, there is no mage other than Shiro that could possibly have defeated Gilgamesh 1 vs 1.</br>  <br><br><br>So wouldn't that make him the strongest mage on earth right now or are there mages out there that are servant tier or stronger?</br></br></br>  <br>being able to defeat a specific enemy does not imply a global power ranking.<br><br>I.e. power levels are more like a cyclical, directed graph than a linear order.<br><br>Caster demonstrated the ability to kill shirou (her web things)<br>Shirou defeated gilgamesh (although he OOMed, so it's not even a clear-cut win)<br>Therefore Caster is stronger than gilgamesh? Obviously not.<br><br>That shit isn't transitive.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So wouldn't that make him the strongest mage on earth right now <br><br>pretty much. The vast majority of powerful mages aren't very competent in battle, they are mostly schemers, working from the shadows. Even Kiritsugu was highly effective at killing them to the point where they feared his name and he was nowhere near UBW Shirou's level.</br></br></br>  <br>Caster fought Shirou at a different time when he was just awakening to his potential. Caster was almost beaten by Rin just because Rin punched her hard.</br>  <br>Fine. Lancer would have skewer shirou like a pig. Does that make lancer the strongest? No.</br>  <br><br>So I take it the only way the mages would be able to dissect Shirou is via massive prep time and a well coordinated ambush using several layers of traps?</br></br>  <br>Top ones can beat him no problem.<br><br>But yeah, Rin was going to be... what, in the top 100 clock tower of all times?<br><br>So I guess Shirou is decently powerful but not that OP like some other Nasuverse monsters</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fighting him head-on on without preparation certainly would be stupid.</br>  <br> Who is Zelretch </br>  <br>Does he do it by transporting himself or the swords to another world line?</br>  <br>99 percent of those magi, if not 100 percent of those magi, would not be able to defeat Rho Aias.<br><br>Archer said that the only time he ever saw Rho Aias defeated was by Gae Bolg.<br><br>As far as Shirou is concerned, Shirou has one of the best defense in the entire world and only an enemy magi with firepower that surpasses Gae Bolg would be able to defeat his Rho Aias.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rho Aias is also something that costs a lot of mana (since its not a sword) so its not like he can spam it all the time</br>  <br>Kiritsugu only got back one percent of his family's magic crest from Clock Tower.<br><br>Of course, Kiritsugu's time alter wasn't that impressive.<br><br>He lacked all the good shit his family magic was known for since Clock Tower took all the parts of his family magic crest in charge of stability and advanced techniques.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rho Aias is a conceptual shield against projectiles.</br>  <br>Yeah, but point still stands that Shirou has one of the best defenses in the world.<br><br>Rho Aias is not as hax as Avalon but it's pretty close and I highly doubt there are many people in the world that are Cu's equal when it comes to Gae Bolg's firepower.<br><br>And the great thing about UBW is that the enemy risks damaging their weapon by trying to breach Rho Aias while Shirou doesn't care if one or just two petals break because he can project a complete Rho Aias the next time while the enemy magi is fucked if he or she lacks the knowledge of fixing her unique weapon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It handles energy blast as well. Archer used Rho Aias to protect Shirou from Ea.</br>  <br>bazett vs. shirou, who wins?</br>  <br>Bazett rapes him unless he starts in UBW deployed already and spams ASAP<br><br>I think Nasu confirmed she kicks his ass</br></br></br>  <br><br>Bazett. Nasu';s sais that a few times.</br></br>  <br>Well, for one bazett is already dead. Shirou wins.</br>  <br>Bazzet wipes the floor with anyone in hand to hand bar Kazuki without seeing his skill beforehand.</br>  <br>Shirou would win if he spent enough time in Ireland and learning Irish history and literature because Irish mythology is full of weaknesses due to the theme of Geas.<br><br>Bazett's Irish ancestor could have made a stupid vow or promise that affects Bazett's entire family and Shirou could have exploited such a family weakness but yeah, until Shirou decides to visit Ireland, Bazett would win.</br></br></br>  <br> Geas affects the entire family line <br>Why are paddies so stupid?</br></br>  <br>Is there really any advantage to reading the VN first?</br>  <br><br>This makes me wonder how someone with 100% of this time hax magic crest got ganked by some jealous magi institute.</br></br>  <br>Depends on timeline. Bazett ends up living with Shirou anyways.</br>  <br> Kiritsugu only got back one percent of his family's magic crest from Clock Tower. <br><br>What does this 100% family crest look like? Able to stop time or something?</br></br></br>  <br>Mongols.</br>  <br>It can probably go further without causing that much damage.</br>  <br>Fins are the biggest weebs.</br>  <br><br>Im pretty sure the crest actually was used for research of immortality. The original use had nothing to do with battle. Kiritsugu adjusted the crest to fit his usage.</br></br>  <br>like a bitch in heat</br>  <br>Luvia does it to get Rin jealous. Luvia wants Rin's attention.</br>  <br>Pet names for lovers. C'mon Shirou, geez.</br>  <br>Can we all agree that the person Rin married in HF Normal was Luvia?</br>  <br>Fund this. I want to see luvia break shirou softly.</br>  <br>She became married to her  job as luvias servant. </br>  <br>No</br>  <br>You get to experience it like the others &amp; aren't a secondary.</br>  <br>You get to experience the F/SN story in it's best format, you get all the context you need to better understand and appreciate Zero and you're basically free to watch every Fate anime in any order you want without getting spoiled or missing vital information.</br>  <br><br>Gay Baitge: The bait that reverses causality, you're baited before it's even posted.</br></br>  <br>She actually ended up marrying  you </br>  <br>I couldn't Rin is my favorite but she belongs to Shirou or Luvia.</br>    <br>I think Baet Bolg sounds better.</br>  hmmm  <br>Glad I'm not the only one who noticed that. It seems that Dark Souls isn't the only game that Nasu is into.</br>  <br>So, Caster could have been an elf after all...</br>  <br>Can Shirou make swords from videogames?</br>  <br>He can create swords in the shape of the ones we see in videogames if he wants, but replicating their powers becomes impossible since those swords have no real master, therefore they aren't NPs.</br>    <br>remember when kotomine read that bible passage in english during Tokiomi's funeral at the end of Zero?</br>  <br>Luvia is an acceptable name, but the gelita part is kinda weird, but it could be passed off as a double name, like Anne-Mari.</br>  <br>It's Luvia Zeritta, she has two names.</br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Iwq<wbr>rR7NDqoc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I see that Tohoska's are violent gorilla women and can't take a simple jest, like always.</br>  <br>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOHOHOHOHOHO </wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>nice post, Luvia-sama.</br>  <br>Everywhere. She's like 40% nose.</br>  <br>  a sorceress and tactician who runs around in colourful outfits </br>  <br>Because she is gifted.</br>  <br>So this is bait that will bait its target even if the shitposter that laid the bait dies?</br>  <br><br> Sherou <br> Not Chèrou <br><br>Why was this allowed?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the target was already baited before he bit the hook and replied.</br>  <br> Sherou <br> Not Scheiße </br></br>  <br>So you are saying it reverses reply and bait?!</br>  <br>It's really not that odd. People tend to forget that it's actually only Shirou who visualizes Servant parameters in RPG stats and attributes. <br>He obviously has a thing for them on some level.</br></br>  <br><br>What's with the spikes on the lower ones' hilt? You'd stab yourself before anyone else like that.</br></br>  <br>But Archer can use projection to create things that aren't swords, like his bow or a fishing rod, which isn't hollow on the inside like the random junk projections he has lying around his shed.</br>  <br>Kirei told Tokiomi that Saber had many A rank stats back in Zero. Clearly he also has an affinity for D&amp;D.</br>  So, this will be aired in a few minutes now. <br><br>What are /a/ thoughts about it? It really seems like just another ordinary rom/com</br></br>  just another ordinary rom/com  Standard romcom with more ecchi than usual.<br>It's a short, isn't it? Couldn't hurt to watch.</br>  <br>Discipline committee best girl. Also loli mom is great.<br><br>Pretty much anyone but Kaichou.</br></br></br>  <br> this <br><br>Also it seems to have some characters, but i really haven't read the manga</br></br></br>  http://www.douyutv.com/5275<br>Livewatch</br>    Oh boy I can see me getting some good reaction images out of this.  whoa when did they announce a anime for this? <br>Also hope the ecchi scenes can produce the same quality of heart/boner that the manga gave me</br>    It only gets interesting after the 20th chapter, naturally the anime will cut off before that.    CENSORSHIP.<br><br>Dropped</br></br>   Black screen <br>Everybody go home now, nothing to see here.</br>  Well shit.  <br>Really? Not like i had hope for that since the ecchi scenes are better than Highschool DxD but god damn it</br>  They could have atleast used sunglare or fucking lazers   No censorship <br><br>BASED AT-X<br><br><br><br>Where the hell you guys watched it? AT-X don't censored it</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh y-<br><br>Wait what</br></br></br>  <br>I believe its the streamer who does it, well, better luck tomorrow then.</br>  <br>Well, im conflicted tanks to </br>  <br><br>http://himado.in/278871<br><br>Have fun</br></br></br></br>  Just watch the manga, I believe its as lewd as to love-ru.      I don't understand how anyone could dislike here.<br><br>How did /a/ react to Chu-Bra? I don't think I was around.</br></br>  <br>  I believe its as lewd as to love-ru. <br>No anon, in this place they're less than one step to fuck, MC more than 1 time fingered her and make her cum<br><br><br>  That voice <br>  actual good animation for a short anime <br>I like it so far</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Thank you.</br>  Damnit I missed the livestream.<br>Raws when?</br>  <br>see<br><br>I don't know man, Anana's voice just doesn't fit in for me.</br></br></br>  Just picked up the manga a few days ago, despite being borderline hentai it's cute as fuck, I really like it. Is it a short then?  <br>Yes it is, 10 minutes or so.</br>  <br>This could be a great reaction image.</br>  So it will cover pretty much the first 3-4 volumes.  <br> romcom <br><br>This shit doesn't even deserves to be called RomCom.</br></br></br>  <br>It is more like relationship with the buxom girl trying to NTR the female lead.</br>  <br>What a shame, oh well, my nutbladder is ready.</br>  <br> trying to NTR the female lead <br> I hope she succeeds. </br></br>  <br>Good, female lead is boring as shit and a moron. Titty monster sisters are way better</br>  <br>In the newest chapters she is making lots of progress. It is also fun seeing her turn from a side character into basically the second female lead.<br><br>Half the chapters are now Rin chapters.</br></br></br>  <br>You monster, she is cute and she deserve MC's love.</br>  <br>When did /a/ start hating cute airheads?</br>  <br><br>Kaichou is only good when her loli mother is around.</br></br>  <br>Are you reading the same manga? Wakana is the smart one, Rin is the tsundere airhead.</br>  <br><br>The cute airhead is pretty much special needs and hasn't even had any focus yet. Nor have either of the lolis.</br></br>  <br><br>Fucking devil.  I do too. </br></br>  <br>Ui has literally birds in her head.</br>  <br>Yeah, here is a photo of the newest chapter.<br><br>It is a Rin one, while the last was a Wakana one.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a harem and she's the main rival, she was never a side character.</br>  <br>Not a harem if two girls are going after one guy, and he likes both of them.<br><br>That is a love triangle.</br></br></br>  <br> http://himado.in/278871 <br>THOSE ARE BREASTS</br></br>  <br>Point still stands.</br>  i like this manga  <br>And i like you</br>  <br>yeah i made a friend</br>  <br><br><br>Greatest bro story ever told.</br></br></br>  I don't really like the anime design, the manga art is way better  Airing uncensored!<br><br>I dropped the manga, since it was meh and theres lots of better stuff to read - but might give a try to anime for fanservice doze without need to wait for BDs.</br></br>  <br>Its not gay, its BROMANCE</br>  <br> school uniform shirt <br> apron <br> no pants or skirt <br>Glorious. Tell me she actually dresses like this at least once.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes she does, later on</br>  <br>Picked up.</br>  <br>Read the manga, its heart/boner inducing and some parts just makes you diamonds</br>  <br>Perfect balance</br>  <br>The art also doesn't look like shit.</br>  <br>This reminds me of Aiura.<br>Shot, lewd but kept cute things going.<br>Does it have a catchy OP?</br></br></br>  <br>Sadly no.</br>  <br>Well, the art isn't bad but it could have been better</br>  <br>Well, that sucks. At least this is going to give me some massive boners.</br>  Isn't there an actual porn version of the story the artist does on the side or something? I recall hearing something like that when I was originally looking into the series.  <br>She was originally a hentai artist that went legit.<br><br>Though she is rolling in the dough now, so she probably didn't regret it. The funny thing is that of her two current series, this is actually the more family friendly one.</br></br></br>   people liking tsundere mcbigtits over kaichou   <br> rom/com <br>dropped</br></br>  <br> Goddamn Waifu wars already <br><br>Its only going to be more vicious once Rin establishes herself as a major character.</br></br></br>  Kaichou x Fuku-kaichou a best.<br><br>Who's gonna sub this?</br></br>  <br>What's the other one? this is the most recent one according to baka updates</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qUo<wbr>PoshcMzo</wbr>  [ ]  <br>The power of f̶r̶i̶e̶n̶d̶s̶h̶i̶p̶ porn</br>  <br>Yeah, the other series is really really lewd compared to Okusama.<br><br>Which makes sense because Okusama is a shonen series, and her other one is a seinen.</br></br></br>  <br>looks like DDY is translating it right now since no simulcasts aired.</br>  <br>It can be used to add the text: "Look at this faggot".</br>  THANK GOD FOR ATX  <br>Glorious, thanks!</br>  OH HI I'M BACK!<br><br>LET'S HAVE ANOTHER GETTER STORYTIME.<br><br>If you didn't read volume 1 yet:<br>http://pastebin.com/ga9MdZaG</br></br></br></br></br>  And we begin!

Stop posting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCK YOU</br>  <br>No please I want to see a three for three</br>  <br>Your new fix confuses me.<br><br>Selfcest nagi OTP?</br></br></br>    <br>FINAL TRY, TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.<br><br><br>Negi doesn't see Eva that way. Eva only held affection for Nagi because he reminded her of Touta. Come to think of it Touta resembles Nagi more than he does Negi. He's not a booksmart neat freak like Negi was.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think he knew that since the first chapter.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>My man, Ken's delivery train hasn't stopped since Kitty/Eva showed up in this new arc and I like it. This is what UHQ should had been about from the start. It's always better when Eva is involved.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm proud of you anon</br>  <br>Man, the number of drunks in this thread is increasing,</br>  <br>Congratulations anon, you got it right.</br>  <br>You don't read UQH while drunk?</br>  <br>We can't really know how Negi felt about it for certain, he liked "someone" and all we have are some hints about who it wasn't more than who it was. You're probably right about Nagi, it felt shallow and this development fits in with it nicely but that doesn't really have any bearing on whether or not her mind could have changed in the future once/if she got over him</br>  <br><br><br><br>Yes. YES. As an Evafag, this pleases my heartpenis. I don't care if it is Negi or Touta, both are alright so I'm fine with whoever.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It is the only way to enjoy any Ken Akamatsu work</br>  <br>Eva has never gotten over Touta, she is the one who gave her a reason to live and she has always cherished their memories together. Even when she was saying her final goodbyes she couldn't let go. To me it looked like she was stocking up on enough Touta love to last her an eternity.</br>  <br>Actually Love Hina is best enjoyed stoned, Negima and UQH are better drunk.</br>  <br>This is a complete assumption on your part, she certainly got over him enough that she fell for Nagi and enough that she doesn't recognize that the boy she's taking care of is literally him</br>  i really like<br>loli eva</br>  <br>he is the one who<br>you know what fuck this. Night you faggots. Have fun shipping without me here to rub it in the faces of Springfags that they were just shoddy replacements of Touta to Eva.</br></br>  <br>yep</br>  <br> tfw Naru is my favorite <br> I'll always get called out on my shit taste <br><br>No regrets though, she was pretty much my waifu in the early 2000s and Horie Yui is GOAT.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She probably recognized him when she rescued him, but she wasn't sure if he meet her pre or post amnesia.</br>  <br>Don't worry anon, Naru was one of my favorites too.</br>  I wonder how old past Eva actually is at this point.  One starts to appreciate Yukihime more once we learn that Eva is just copying her mom's haircut  <br>That's only worse for your case if she does recognize him, because that would mean she was over him enough that she could just play a mother to him and not worry about any special feelings for him</br>  <br>28 probably, a lovely Christmas cupcake</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure she wandered for several years across the countryside before ending up at Dana's according to her recollections.</br>   The dolls come out <br>I have a bad feeling this is the closest we'll get to an appearance from Chachamaru for another 100 chapters</br>  <br>Little less than 40, she was 17 when she first met Touta and since then 18 years have passed so she's 35 now. She would have to wait more than she has presently lived to have a sliver of hope of seeing Touta again and it's not even certain that he will be capable of attending when that time comes.</br>  <br>Mentally and physically she is still 14. which are the only things that count.</br>  <br>She was turned into a vampire when she was 10</br>  <br>She is physically 9 or 10. Mentally, she'd be around 30-40 ish now.</br>  <br>Nagi is timeloop shenanigans Touta</br>  <br> Touta dyes his hair and NTRs Eva with Arika <br>I'd laugh, but I doubt it</br></br>  <br>Nagi doesn't have Touta's skillset. He has neither the light of Ostia, nor the darkness of demons.</br>    <br><br>yeah, my mistake. <br><br>Anyway, she says she's 16 here, and this is the page she got petted. So that would make her 34 in the newest chapter.<br><br> Mentally, she'd be around 30-40 ish now. <br>Experience in life does not equal mental age.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's what everyone means when they say mental age, especially when you're talking about immortals.</br>  <br> So when will we get back to the future? I was not ready for these feels ;_;. <br>Man. She nursed a crush on him for at least 10 years. And in the series' present day, he got Dana-rifted right in front of her. Her being off balance in that entire scene could have been a mix of memories and hope.<br><br>When he gets out of training, she's going to be right there, he's going to be all "sorry for making you wait".</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's what it means in regular situations. When a person has downs that is not what it means, when a person suffered brain damage that is not what it mean, and when a person is immortal and because of that never goes through puberty, thus doesn't have his brain structure and hormonal balance change, it certainly shouldn't be what it means.</br>  <br>No, dont make me hope please ;_;</br>  So what happens that makes her go evil enough Nagi confines her to the school?  <br> Making this more complicated than it needs to be <br>Mental age is how long your mind has aged, physical age is how long your body has aged. Bam, done. If you're 14 and had a coma for one year you're physically 14 mentally 13, if you're a loli vampire who's lived 700 years you're mentally 700 and physically 12, bam done. You know this is why immortals always talk about how old they really are and what it's supposed to convey so pulling "muh puberty, muh fully developed brain cortexes" when KA probably hasn't even thought of that in the first place is stupid.</br></br>  <br>Misunderstandings. He most likely sealed her there because she kept following him</br>  <br><br>You should know by now that whatever fan theory about an Akamatsu manga is the most implausible and ridiculous always turns out to be right.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, she is trying to be a good role model for her first friend.</br>  <br>She's called the Dark Evangel though.</br>  <br> Most likely <br>He straight up said that was why it was, and to top it off he completely forgot like a week later<br><br>That was from before meeting Nagi and he didn't particularly take it into account</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, he won't bring it up, he still feels too worthless to win the Evabowl. He will do something after their match in the tournament.</br>  <br>Misunderstandings</br>  <br><br><br>Goddamn Japanese misunderstandings</br></br></br>  <br>The greeks did it first.</br>  Well Eva actually is considered an evil mage with a price on her head. It's been mentioned many times. Has nothing to do with Nagi though.  <br>I think we should ask why she was wanted instead though.</br>  <br>Probably just doing vampire things to survive her whole life.</br>  <br>She did mention having to kill people to survive in Negima.</br>  <br> No, dont make me hope please ;_; <br><br>Well, if she's an alternate timeline's Eva, that means she graduates from Dana's training, goes through the centuries the long way, eventually loses hope she'll meet Touta again, finally meets Nagi and receives headpats and hope, goes through the events of Negima and recognizes something is up with Chao but keeps her silence, and after the Asuna-sleeps-too-long Bad End scenario, hooks up with another Chao to find Touta. Akamatsu springs her arrival in this timeline on us at some unexpected point years from now, after we've been allowed to forget about rift-Eva. Bonus: this gets Chao into the story without having to worry about continuity, lets her troll any number of characters, and lets her drop hints about how things went in her native timeline.</br></br></br>  <br>She probably killed people and fought them to survive, plus I am sure that others tried to kill her first because she was an immortal. So basically she found herself force to be an evil Mage because that was the best way to survive at the time and kept on doing evil stuff because it was hard to care for Others.<br><br>She was lonely and didn't change until 3a.</br></br></br>  <br>I bet that Chao is a clone from the same project as Touta in this continuity or something like that.</br>  <br>Fuck ;_;</br>  <br> She did mention having to kill people to survive in Negima. <br><br>Vampires probably have a standing bounty on them just for being vampires. <br>Successfully evading bounty hunters raises the price, because clearly that means you're smarter and more dangerous than the ones the hunters easily kill. The increased price draws more senior hunters to you.<br>Terrorizing a few but letting them go might seem like it would scare them off, but probably just causes the bounty to go up more. <br>Having to kill the more skilled hunters raises the price immensely, because clearly you're a terrible monster if you can defeat the really good hunters. <br><br>Although she'd already killed people to survive before Dana grabbed her, according to the flashback where she was an expendable child soldier.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>C-Chachamaru?!<br>D-doushio.</br></br>  <br>Touta x Eva FTWWW</br>  Eva is still my most favorite vampire loli. Shinobu is a close second though.  <br> I bet that Chao is a clone from the same project as Touta in this continuity or something like that. <br><br>No, Negi changed events. Remember, the Chao at the pre-ending of Negima was still the one from Negima - her native timeline wasn't erased, all she'd done is successfully created better branches. There's no rule of inevitable fixed outcomes in the negiverse that forces a Chao to always be born in every timeline. <br><br>Fortunately it doesn't matter, because Negima did happen in UQ Holder's past, therefore there is definitely at least one timeline-hopping Chao with access to this one.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thou are right then let me change my idea a bit, I her timeline Chao was the result of a similar project to the one that made Touta.</br>  <br>why?<br>you idea is kinda meaningless?<br>it has nothing to back it up</br></br></br>  <br>  That's only worse for your case if she does recognize him, because that would mean she was over him enough that she could just play a mother to him and not worry about any special feelings for him <br><br>Wouldn't that make Touta even more special then, since Eva's willing to play mother? Eva was willing to hide out in the boonies while protecting Touta, waiting for the day he remembers. (Not to mention turning him into a vampire).</br></br></br>  <br>It makes him more special yeah, by making him family, not romantic which is what I was assuming you were shooting for, if not then sure go for it</br>  <br>is that ippon ,morote or eri seonage?</br>  <br><br>They are all speculations, everything points out that she doesn't remember him.</br></br>  <br>Of course it's speculation that's why the sentence says "if"</br>  <br>My god ;_;</br>  <br>Why did Touta look like a bishie on this page?</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>You'd make romantic passes on a boy who's 680+ years younger, has just lost his parents and his memories? Give it time, Touta still needs to mature :).<br><br><br>Exactly. Majority of posts in /a/ are based on speculation.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's always going to be 700 years younger than her anon unless she does some stupid shit like freeze herself. If you wait, especially several hundred years someone else will steal him away.</br>  if eva has that much affection for touta why has't yuikihime jumped on him yet. Maybe she remembered and made him immortal because of that. maybe she's been treating touta as a raise your own husbando.  <br> implying Touta won't become kill before anything happens </br>   go on panda <br> Negima doujins on the front page <br> all NTR <br>Fuck me.</br></br></br>  <br>I suggest you go re-read the early chapters again, armed with what we know now. For example, here's Eva encountering Touta while he's on the verge of death and recognizing him.</br>  <br>Here she is trying to establish a less motherly relationship with Touta.</br>  <br>Here she is a few chapters later, trying to stir some interest in Touta.</br>  <br> NTR <br>B-but Negima didn't have any canon couples except Nagi x Arika, and Kotarou x Natsumi.</br></br>  <br> Trying to establish a less motherly relationship <br> Taking your kid to the zoo <br> Only trying anything literally years later after your image as a mother is set </br></br></br>  <br>And getting mad when he doesn't respond like she wants.</br>  What will Eva's reaction be when she sees him in the right timeline?  <br><br><br><br>Nice catches anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Here we have Eva making it pretty clear that she's trying to tailor her appearance to attract Touta's attention.</br>  <br> What is the pride of a woman </br>  <br>I swear to god, Eva better get a happy ending.</br>  <br>It's clear that Eva is really invested in Touta for reasons she's never been able to talk to him about.</br>  I think present Eva will reject him and he'll end up with the female trap, since it's pretty obvious that it's gonna choose to be a female since it clearly has feeling for Tota.  <br> Update <br>Nope, he'll just someone else that has feelings for Touta sort of like how the other 30 chicks in Negima had feelings for Negi, doesn't mean he chose them.</br></br>  UQ holder is pretty good, but did people actually read Negima? <br>Shit was worse than the anime adaptation, it was like double the suffering.</br>  Touta is such a beta homo.  <br>Which ass did you pull this out from? Shithead!</br>  <br> 18 years <br>Someone else did that?</br></br>  <br>There were parts of Negima that I liked. The big cast made it a little too hyperactive and unfocused. That said, you could make a solo manga series for any of the main girls  except Asuna  and I'd be interested in reading them. The start may have been trying too hard to appeal to Love Hina migrants. The ending feels like every retiring manga ending. Sloppy, unnatural, a little bit rushed, and dropping more than one plot thread in the process.</br>  <br> She trains everyday, waiting for those days where she can see her beloved again. <br>;_;</br></br>  <br>I agree with you about Negima's ending, but isn't that what UQ Holder is for? To fix and answer unfinished plot threads? The series isn't even 100 chapters</br>  <br>WHAT'S GOING ON<br>"<br>AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure that's always supposed to have been her recognizing what Touta is rather than who.</br>    I'm honestly only reading for Santa and Karin at this point.    <br> Not Evangeline </br>  <br>But only when she was still on adventures.<br>Once the adventures stopped, well.</br></br>  <br> blonde loli vampire wants head pats <br>This is my fetish.</br></br>  <br>Say whatever you want but UQ Holder is a sequel, and as such it may be able to somehow fix some of the plot Negima left behind.<br><br>We'll see in due time</br></br></br>  Reminder  <br>Ken remembers. Now, if only he made an actual gaiden for Eva that covers all of her past and an epilogue of dimension hopping Eva.</br>  <br>dude a Real Gaiden of Eva could be forever and the story would´t even drag.there would be so much to cover.</br>  <br>I wish some parts of the manga got rescanned</br>  <br>Her parents, maybe?</br>  <br><br><br><br>she got her happy end together with Chachamaru in the timeline were Asuna didn't wake up, wich should be also Toutas timeline.<br><br>the translator fucked up some text bubbles but another anon already confirmed through the raws that it es her and Chachamaru at Negis side.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> since then 18 years have passed <br>Ten or eleven years have passed. She's 28, here.</br></br>  <br>It was Tota</br>  <br>Isnt yukihime( Touta's mother eva) from a different timeline from the kitty who knows Touta? We already had time shenanigans with Chao, and it works with different universes and shit. I can see the kitty who likes Touta coming to this timeline and staying.</br>  thanks, mega guy.  <br>There are only three major timelines.<br>The one Chao is from, where Negi never developed Magia Erebea.<br>The one Asuna is asleep in, which UQ Holder takes place in.<br>The one Asuna was awake in, which was shown in the Negima epilogue.<br><br>There is absolutely nothing to indicate that the young-Yukihime we've been seeing is from an alternate timeline. Besides, this is all happening for her waaaaaaay before the timelines split.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>in this chapter she said they are from different times.also you forgot that diferent time branches beginn at the same starting point and than diverge.</br>  <br> Ten or eleven years have passed. She's 28, here. <br><br>To expand on your post in case anyone still doesn't get it:<br><br>Last headpat from her family before being turned into a vampire at 10.<br>Met Touta in the rift at 16. <br>Current headpat today from Touta 10 years after last week's chapter.<br><br>She says it's been 18 years total, which fits. The time gap between them had been expanding from the start, and we can already cleanly account for 16 years of her life as a vampire, so it's not weird to think that all of their earlier meetings fit within a 2 year span for her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I though it was stablished that time worked with the multiverse theory and it wouldnt be possible to get something from our own timeline past. I just dont think Yukihime(Touta's "mother") is the same person as kitty.</br>  <br>Unless, of course, it's a stable time loop. We had plenty of those happen during the Festival.</br>  This is getting even more stupid by the chapters. Why is Ken stroking Touta's dick so much? Fuck this shit.  <br>and when she is?</br>  <br> This is getting even more stupid by the chapters <br>he does think you dont´t like.<br>That makes it not stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>Good.<br><br>I like tota more than negi.</br></br></br>  <br><br>because he is inferior to Negi and Nagi in a lot of ways.</br></br>  <br> Why is Ken stroking Touta's dick so much? <br><br>he did the same Negi though.</br></br></br>  <br> because he is inferior to Negi and Nagi in a lot of ways. <br>Oh no a 4 years old clone is inferior than the original and his dad.</br></br>  <br> eva giving head to touta <br><br>WHA</br></br></br>  So im confused. Where is it said that uq holder happens in the sleeping asuna timeline?  <br> I though it was stablished that time worked with the multiverse theory and it wouldnt be possible to get something from our own timeline past. I just dont think Yukihime(Touta's "mother") is the same person as kitty. <br><br> Unless, of course, it's a stable time loop. We had plenty of those happen during the Festival. <br><br>Not-science-fiction stories usually don't plan the timehax out that deeply and just say it's a closed loop, ignoring the paradox. <br><br>You can actually make this work without a paradox, though; a chain of timeline hops that happens to converge onto repeating itself for a long stretch. (It could actually repeat infinitely, or it could diverge out again later). Touta N+2 met Eva N+3, but after he leaves the rift and returns to his timeline, there's the Eva N+2 who raised him, who had met Touta N+1 in her own past...<br><br>From a certain point of view, Negima itself created such a stable loop by the way it ended: Asuna hopped to another timeline's past. In the epilogue, she's changed things - but in that epilogue's timeline, there was still a Chao, and there is still that timeline's native Asuna sleeping. When she wakes up, they'll probably send her to another timeline where another Asuna sleeps. <br><br>UQ Holder could be a different chain of repeating timelines accidentally (or intentionally) triggered by the Eva and Chao who left for their own adventures after sending Asuna on hers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The one Asuna is asleep in, which UQ Holder takes place in. <br>Has this been actually confirmed? It seems strange, because the Eva we see in that timeline is alone and decided to go on alternative universe adventures in search for a Nagi who didn't marry Arika.</br></br>  <br>Touta dies, probably.</br>  <br> Has this been actually confirmed? <br>No, it's just a theory.</br></br>  <br>touta can´t die thats the point of his immortily.</br>  <br>Then he ends up with Kuromaru.</br>  <br>Eva is also immortal.</br>  <br>it's just an assumption.</br>  <br>KEK. oh god, that got me good.</br>  <br>What makes you think that?<br><br>The fact that Asuna's material was used on Touta, meaning that Asuna's power is not available therefore she is asleep?<br><br>Or the absence of Asuna in the flashback where Negi and co are hunting for the mage of the beginning?</br></br></br></br></br>  I have only read Uq holder.<br><br>Should I check out the other mangas in the series too or? The pictures and few pages I have seen seemed really boring and just harem / ecchi manga like.</br></br>  <br>You can't prove that's the case. It could very well be a 4th, 5th, nth timeline. Nothing has been confirmed at all.</br>  <br><br>its like 30+ volumes long, a few pages don't say much about the whole manga, also Negima had an genre shift like 3 or 4 times.</br></br>  <br>Isnt there supposed to be 2 Asuna's in the same timeline because of the loop? One is sleeping and the other is the Asuna who jumped to this timeline, it would mean Negi would always end up as "dead" wouldnt it?</br>  <br><br>Negis death date also confirms, it isn't Asunas sleeping for 100 years timeline either, it could be an totally unrelated timeline to the ones we saw in Negima, including Chaos timeline.</br></br>  <br>If you want to discuss this series you should read Negima. Read Love Hina too while you're at it.</br>  <br>If you do plan on reading Negima, be warned it starts as a pretty meh romantic comedy.</br>  <br><br>I wouldn't mind at all. In fact, I wish for it to happen.</br></br>  <br> Read Love Hina too while you're at it. <br><br>Why would you do that</br></br></br>  Would Touta supported Chao in the School Festival arc.I kinda disliked Negi in this arc.  <br>Because it's an influential series and a nice way to pass an afternoon. Of course there's no reason to force yourself to read a series you hate, but at least give the big ones a chance before dismissing them.</br>  <br>Both the intended contents and execution of your post were terrible. Stick to lurking.</br>  <br>It starts out like that but quickly shifts to action and adventure.</br>  <br>easter eggs and junk negro<br>it improves the experience</br></br>  <br>me too anon. Good taste.</br>  <br>Akase x Godel<br>Twin x Aliens<br>SetsuxKonoka (i hope)<br>YuexNodoka (i hope)<br>Chisamexherself.<br>Negix girl (i hope)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, Eva is like Uchihas. she cannot be happy.</br>  <br>Kuro -&gt; Asuna zone.</br>  <br>She has real chances this time though, the MC actually loves her, she just needs to keep her loli form because it's way more fuckable and new for Touta.</br>  <br>he loves loli vampiro. He has good taste</br>  Great chapter, now I see where the story is heading, much like Negi's training + show-down versus Rakan, here it will be between Touta and Eva, it will probably start with Eva adult form and when Touta say "it's been a while, Kitty", Eva will turn into her young form and the match will start  Cute chapter. Curious about what will happen when he meets Eva in his time line.  <br>This arc has really given some direction to the manga, it's even been good despite being a training arc.</br>  <br><br>How didn't it had a direction before?</br></br>  <br>best arc. Eva raped Negi.</br>  <br>It felt kinda aimless, like<br> now we're a group of immortal people <br> and we help in incidents, I guess <br> but not really because TOURNAMENT <br>It kinda jumps around.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I love how Touta looks like on this panel.<br>The entire panel just screams sadness with Touta looking depressed.</br></br></br>  <br> and now we are in a training flashback arc <br><br>I don't see the difference from before.</br></br></br>  <br> your life is gonna be so, so terrible <br> I'm sorry I couldn't help </br></br>  <br> start with Eva adult form and when Touta say "it's been a while, Kitty" <br>I want her to blush, she better give me a blush</br></br>   manga is shit <br> old Eva appear <br> it's good <br><br>This shit should've been like this from the start.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Immortals always grasping the concept of time-sensitive flags </br>  <br>Eva is adorable.</br>  <br>Kitty says goodbye for now. The next chapters may lose quality.</br>  <br><br>I really want this page in tankobon quality.</br></br>  <br>Slu</br>  <br>Watch your mouth.</br>  <br>did Eva cook for Touta? wow.</br>  <br>It seems Eva cant cook</br>  <br>He looked so dead inside, like Santa.</br>  Reminder that Eva slapped Touta when he said he is a replacement for Nagi.  <br>This goes so deep. He isn't the replacement, he's the original.</br>  <br><br>Maybe that never changed.</br></br>  <br><br>Eva's fashion style sure changed a lot over the centuries.</br></br>  <br>irony?</br>  <br>  you know who won the negibowl /a/non  </br>  Mein chinchin.  <br>Do people actually like this shit? The author threw the first 60 something chapters out of the window for this forced shit. Touta is generic with no personality and he keeps losing every single fight and every single fight is just him charging in and maybe one asspull powerup near the end<br><br>This is so fucking bland and stupid</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes, everybody knows this manga is crap. People just care about Eva. She was always the best thing about Negima.</br></br>  <br>fate. Eva is Touta´s waifu and Negi rejected his harem.</br>  <br>I like how it started simple and went on to be elaborate as the time went on</br>  <br><br> head pats <br><br>A new kind of l-lewd.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sadly after this we probably won't get some more headpats until after the tournament arc.</br>  <br>I...It's ok! I can wait ;_;<br> meh over 150 chaps </br></br>  <br>Last headpat was Touta during on of their meetings a few chapters ago.</br>  <br> i like sweets <br><br> table full of nothing but sweet stuff </br></br></br>  <br>Be strong anon, be strong, the wait will make the next one even better, right?</br>  <br>She wanted to impress him<br> last time I offered him a couple of magic cakes <br> this time it's a fucking buffet <br> that'll show him how amazing I am </br></br></br></br>  <br>ch 80 when she was sucking his blood iirc.</br>  i only say. Lolis vampire are cute. Eva is the best in this serie.  <br>I just fear that all my hopes will be crushed in the unpredictable future ... this hurts alot anon.<br><br>Eva is the saving point of this entire verse.</br></br></br>  <br>Eva is love, Eva is life, and that's why Touta is the Springfield with the best taste. He chose her.</br>  So, just to confirm and be sure.<br>Kirie lost the touta bowl, and hard, didn't she?</br>  <br> may Touta protect her smile?</br>  <br><br>The elaborate Eva is from ancient past. Normal Eva just runs around in panties and babydoll.</br></br>  <br>I am not sure if he will protect her smile, but I bet he will try his best to do that. <br><br><br>Nah, right now it looks like Touta doesn't think he can win the Evabowl, so there might be a chance for either Kirie or Kuro to do something to gain an advantage. But yeah, they are not in a good position.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He will do his best to bring it back.</br>  <br>buhuhu. another sad individual whose EvaxXXX ship went to drain. get over it, Nagi and especialy NegixEva was never going to happen. I really don't understand how so many of you thought of that happening...</br>  <br>well... Touta is negi clon so It is a NegixEva indirect</br>  <br>Nah, Touta is his own person, so if he wins the Evabowl he won it on his own terms.</br>  <br>Touta is a lolicon. It's obvious. I guess that works out well for Eva.</br>  <br> Touta is a lolicon <br> Not mommycon </br></br>  <br>No, Touta is so far from being a proper clone that  Nagi's father is a clone of Touta .</br>  <br><br>Seriously, this. It was obvious since forever that it's not going to happen.</br></br>  <br>well ... he has won many more points with one girl that Negi with all the girls in his serie.<br><br>Touta deserves Eva more than Negi.</br></br></br>  Their last meeting nearly had me in tears when I saw the table of food. When Eva had promised that the next time they met, she’d have everything ready for his next visit, I immediately had the thought that for Eva to have such a feast ready for Touta, she had to have it ready in advance. She never knew when Touta was coming, so as I see it, Eva had her dolls make a feast every day for who knows how long, maybe even the entire eight years, just so she’d be sure to be ready for him once he arrived. Just that thought brought a massive lump into my throat as I could empathize with Eva’s character and the loneliness she must have felt over the years, waiting for her friend to return, and the hope that today would be the day she’d get to see her friend.  <br>personalitywise it may be more NagixTouta. At least that's why Eva fell for Nagi in the first place (intersting how that was never really explained and was dealt more as a joke),</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127433252 <br>Would it hurt to not abuse ellipses? You're not in a chat room</br>  <br>ok. i´m sorry.</br>  does Touta have a young male rival like the beast kid from Negima?  <br>Or she could have prepared it once and put everything into stasis for the proper time. Because magic.</br>  <br>He has FATE. Does that count as young male?</br>  <br>yes its a Noble.<br>he hasn´t appeared yet.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127433252 <br>ups, I meant NagixEva</br>  <br> FOR YOU </br>  <br><br>So Fate and the Noble will be his rivals? Poor Touta. I do hope that eventually this means that Touta will lean some vampire powers, because that would be pretty cool if he did.</br></br>  <br>I love how Fate is completely oblivious to the NTR vibes he's giving off to Touta.</br>  <br>It should be Eva the one fearing the NTR from fate.</br>    INB4 Akamatsu pulls off another Negima and he never tells us who Touta/Eva/Negi end up with.  <br>don't you even joke like that. Touta x Eva FTWWW</br>  <br>Anon, we all know it won't happen. So don't get your hopes too up.</br>  <br>too busy thinking about Negi to notice anything else</br>  <br>what would this be in japanese<br>something anata?</br></br>  <br>Those lifeless eyes, Touta knows his chance is gone.</br>  Touta was the first to meet Eva. No Nagi<br><br>Touta was the first to give her his blood. No Negi<br><br>Touta was the first to stroke her head. No Nagi.<br><br>Touta was the first to slip into a dream of eva. No Negi.<br><br>Touta was the first to learn from Eva. No Negi.<br><br>Touta was the first Eva´s friends.<br><br>Touta want to protect her smile.<br><br>I think the moment Touta wins Evabowl.easy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I always thought that the whole Nagi raburabu thing was forced. Touta made it makes sense.</br></br>  <br>Better than predict when will Touta win Evabowl.<br>Which DRAMA will ensure in the bumpy road ahead of them?</br></br>  <br>Kuro, Kirie y Karin.<br><br>on the other hand<br><br><br>Touta will be jealous of negi, fate and Nagi.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I  hope  that kuro will be a bro in the end. Even with how girly he acts, it feels like all he wants to do is fist bump touta and engage in some jolly cooperation.</br>  <br>yes, i hope that Touta and Kuro will be the best friend.</br>  his chapter, in some way, I feel VERY sorry for this Evangeline, besides I think that the Evangeline of the present time besides suffer all this, she hadn’t Touta at her side if Dana erased her memories about Touta.  <br>yeah I see some arguments about this over in jp forums too. This chapter has 10 years fgo by for her, but how long do all the other gaps go.<br><br>Is she counting that headpat in her 18 years statement? If so, then there's another 8 years during those other appearances. On the one hand, she seems to talk about days and weeks before meeting, but on the other, there's stuff like how they didn't speak a common language at first, but then Eva was able to speak to him on subsequent appearances suggesting a real passage of time. Not to mention the growth of her power and knowledge.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, that's exactly right, anon.<br><br>Eva tried to set herself up with a happy married life with amnesia-Touta; living together, cooking for her, the curvy adult body she thinks he wants. She'd suddenly encountered her first love again after hundreds of years, after all. Instead she got completely Mom-zoned.<br><br>Then Eva starts letting out her loli form around him, and almost immediately Touta is blushing every time he looks at her. Chalk it up to a combination of lolicon tastes and her breaking out of the Mom-zone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Basically the key for her to win is to be herself and not to play his mom right?</br>  <br>Pretty much. You saw how quickly he fell for Kitty-Eva. Present day Yukihime-Eva is simultaneously trying too hard and not hard enough. She's going to great lengths to try and present herself as the sort of woman she thinks Touta will want, while at the same time not being at all honest about her feelings or talking to him directly.<br><br>It'll be really interesting to see what happens the next time she meets Touta, now that he's caught up on his end of the time loop.</br></br></br>  Does this take place in the main Negima timeline or one of the offshoots?<br><br>How strong is fat vampire lady compared to Rakan, Fate, Eva, lightning Negi, ect?</br></br>  <br><br>Loli wins again.</br></br>  <br><br>So Ken realized that his new adult Eva was ugly?</br></br>  <br>she is the strongest.</br>  <br>yukihime -&gt; her mother.<br><br>It is a ilusion.</br></br></br>  <br> Implying this wasn't the plan for the start. </br>   10/10 perfect milf Yukihime will inevitably be phased out for loli vampire #34674915 <br><br>FUCKING LOLICON NIGGERS <br><br>I HATE THEM SO MUCH <br><br>PEDO GENOCIDE FFFFUCKING WHEN</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Its possible when Kirie dies without Reset<br>she simple reincarnated into a another girl.<br>This or there is secret Uqholder.</br></br>  I don't know how much adult Eva knows about this. She was kind of hinting at setting him up with Karin a little bit.<br><br>Granted it mostly seemed to be on the basis of the two of them probably being the only things left alive in the far future.</br></br>  <br>Eh what? She was and always is a loli. So what is your point here?</br>  <br>your pic is kinda ironic.</br>  Should I read this, is it any good?  Best technique made by best vampire loli.<br><br>Why havent they animated the mundus magicus arc from negima? I´d die to see the Negi vs Rakan fight</br></br>  <br>So basically, all of this will solve itself after the tournament arc, so I guess we will have to wait another 70 chapters for the next headpat. <br><br>Sadly by then Eva might have some serious competition with the Yandere Imoutou coming into play.</br></br></br>  <br>No Money!</br>  <br>Might enjoy it if you've enjoyed Negima.<br><br>If not, just give it a try anyways?</br></br></br>  DATABASE DATABASE<br>JUST LIVING IN THE DATABASE WOW WOW</br>  DON'T LOSE YOUR WAAAAAAAY  OH I'M A LUMBERJACK AND I'M OK  BACK ON THE ROCKS<br>BACK ON THE ROCKS<br>BABY</br></br>  JIBUN WOOOOOOOOOOOOO  FROM THE WINDOW TO THE WALL  RUN AWAY RUN AWAY RUN AWAY RUN AWAY  STANDING  YAPPA PAI YAPPA PAI IISHANTEI  I KNOW, I KNOW I'VE LET YOU DOWN.
