[ Do you feel like you get a little dumber with every day you spend here?  I only become stronger each day. After 8 years I can safely say I'm the strongest.  <br>Do you have that kind of commitment in other areas of your life?</br>  Not really. If you spent more time in /v/ you will definitely become more retarded.  People told me I'm pretty intelligent so I don't feel like I'm losing much, when I manage to get out I might still be in the average.  <br>I feel dumb everytime I come onto /a/. Everyone on this board is a faggot and I barely like anime anymore.</br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>Well done. I'm not sure if you're living your life correctly, but I theorize that you might be.</br>  <br>I feel like I get dumber every day, but not on account of being here.</br>   teiki/mmew <br> ever living correctly <br>Good joke.</br></br>  <br>People on /a/ are all so jaded from their 300+ anime watch list that all they have left to do is collect reaction images, shit on other people's waifus, and generally wallow about in their filthy, gigantic knowledge of anime.</br>  I don't know...I remember a time when I read classic literature, studied ancient cultures, studied programming and computer science, and stuff like that...Now I just look at pictures of cute girls and talk about my waifu.  <br> only 300+ </br>  Being here helped me get desensitized to a place filled with faggots and other social misfits.  <br>Says the facebook user.</br>  <br>If there was a way to get paid for my anime knowledge, I would be a rich mothercucka.</br>  <br> What is blogging? </br>  <br> blogging <br>That's what I have /a/ for.</br></br>  <br>But do you get paid for it?</br>  That would imply that the people here had any intelligence to lose.

Thanks for your concern, though.</br></br>  <br>fuck you, I've spent the past hour reading lance law</br>  <br>I agree but no, that's not "mostly" the reason. Japanese (and I'd argue asian people in general) /are/ artistically better than the rest of the world. Same when it comes to underground music, Japan has so many jewels, if I'd compare with my country (EU) there wouldn't even be a contest, the ratio would be 1/100.<br><br>Also the West =! the US, you're not the fucking center of the world.</br></br></br>  <br>Read this:<br>http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comme<wbr>nts/2p15dd/if_youve_ever_been_a_tou<wbr>rist_in_japan_thank_your/.compact<br><br> Buke was used in the silk trade in Yokohama to mean "not good."

That is because of the many movements that have passed through European grounds, from realism to romanticism, memento mori etc. So if we are to compare artists and art, europe certainly has the upper hand. Unfortunately some of you lack the ability to comprehend greatness or the fact that European artists tend to draw in their adobes and sell their shit in their stores instead of posting it on the internet. Of course the styles are vastly different too but that doesn't mean one or the other is better. It's just different.

I was talking about the present. Japan is in my opinion artistically much more diversified and appealing, and this is mainly due to the fact that artists over there borrow inspiration from other countries and cultures.<br><br>Anyway art is 100% subjective so this conversation is rather meaningless.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Confirmation bias/size.</br></br>  <br>Really, a leckneck of bundy rum and you point out the pilsner as being disgusting?

The unspaced way seems to reflect the way Japanese learn their own grammar better, but the spaces make it look so much better.</br></br></br>  <br>Particles should be treated as a part of the word though</br>  <br> the unspaced way seems to reflect the way Japanese learn their own grammar better <br>Did you even read the whole post before replying?</br></br>  <br>For wa, separating it is okay. wa and mo are "true particles".<br><br>Almost every other particle is a clitic (similar to english's 's, which appends to a word but corresponds to a phrase), including genitive/accusative の and accusative が.</br></br></br>  Question: Are そんな and そういう integrable?<br><br>From the context of what I've been reading, そんなapplies more to a physical thing, and そういう applies to more abstract concepts. <br><br>For example<br> Why is he going THAT fast <br>The "that" in this English sentence is my closest approximation to そういう</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I scrolled down and found two instances immediately. How do you learn a foreign language when you have the attention span of a gnat?</br></br>  <br>そんな/そういう these basically means "something like that" the first one being more informal, they can be used interchangably. <br>ie: そんなことは言ってない、そういうことは言ってない　I haven't said something like that<br>そんなに is more like "so much/such". It's a bit negative, and you can't use そういう in this case.<br>そんなにスピードださなくていい<br>You don't have to drive so fast.

I'm not sure you realize that learning the readings on top of their writing for each Kanji asks a lot more effort than simply knowing how to write them.<br><br>Actually I'm not even sure why I still bother posting around here, /djt/ is fucking shit, go fuck yourselves you rats.</br></br></br>  <br>So, just readings?</br>  <br>The first 結城友奈は勇者である　VN. Its pretty fun but I feel like Im missing half of whats really being said. Occasionally replies won't make sense and there will be sentences where I know all the words but still can't understand what its trying to say. I was going to stop at the third or fourth arc and move on to something harder, but Ill finish it. Has anyone read this VN btw? Have anything that I can read after that is slightly harder in terms of grammar?</br>  <br><br> Two can play this game, a post from some threads ago. <br>RTK is for learning to remember and write the Kanji but the side-effects are useful enough for it to be worth doing even if you aren't interested in handwriting:<br>1. Learning radicals, useful for looking up in electronic dictionaries and distinguishing between similar looking Kanji when you need to.<br>2. Learning stroke order, useful for looking up in electronic dictionaries and deciphering handwriting and weird fonts.<br>3. Learning a unique meaning for a Kanji, useful when learning vocabulary because the Kanji it's made from usually hint to the actual meaning of the word. I know it's the other way around, vocabulary are what give meaning to the Kanji but you can use this relationship to your advantage.<br>4. Radicals usually hint to the meaning of the Kanji. 氵is used in Kanji related to water, useful for inferring.<br>5. Kanji depending on the position of their main radical usually have the same reading shared with other Kanji. RTK2 takes advantage of this fact and teaches readings using this property of radicals.<br>6. Mnemonics are useful for language learning or memorization in general. It's a good technique to learn.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You'd be surprised how the rest you need to know about Kanji comes so easily after you get meaning, radicals and stroke order down.</br>  <br>Did you do RTK2? I remember a few months ago /djt/ trying to find the legendary person who had went through the whole book, could it be you?</br>  <br> I'm not sure you realize that learning the readings on top of their writing for each Kanji asks a lot more effort than simply knowing how to write them. <br>This just proves you are a lazy fag who would rather do less work than actually learning something.<br>It takes much more effort simply learning them with vocabulary, when it will come natural after you study everything with the kanji individually.<br>And you also ignored the usage part, which vocabulary alone might not always teach you well.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't. I just know what it does and after noticing some of the patterns myself while going through vocabulary and learning the readings, I can see why it can be more useful than rote memorization of the readings.</br>  <br>I think (and certainly hope) he's just baiting. It's not possible to be that stupid.</br>  <br>That's why you put read and example sentences in your cards. Do you really think that KD is for learning vocabulary usage? That's fucking retarded.</br>  Could anyone here please articulate the grammar that's going on the in the second to last panel? Chika is obviously being a cheeky cunt, probably remarking how her sister hasn't received Valentine's Day chocolates in a long time.<br><br>あと何年 = after (so many) years? But what is the かしたら doing? Or is it actually just the する verb and the か attached to the 何年, changing that meaning? And きっとついでのチョコになっちゃう... "Surely opportunity of receiving chocolates"? I think I get the gist of what she's saying but my grammar understanding seems all fucked.</br></br>  <br>KanjiDamage really isn't that much different from the kanji learning systems employed in classes anywhere. Stroke order, reading, some mnemonic or pictograph, some example words, and so forth.<br><br>RTK is quite different; you're learning only the stroke order of the character (and one of its meanings, really just as a mnemonic) - you get the rest like example words, readings, etc. through vocabulary.<br><br><br>http://japaneselevelup.com/rtk-teac<wbr>h-japanese/<br><br>Read.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't have anything to do with being lazy. Laziness =! efficiency. Your brain is more likely to remember readings if you're learning them via vocabulary rather than on their own without any vocabulary given to you.<br>Learning thousands of readings on their own like that has to be one of the most stupid things you could recommend to someone starting to learn Japanese.</br></br>  <br>"why are you reading shit?"</br>  <br> This just proves you are a lazy fag who would rather do less work <br>Not everything has to be brute forced.</br></br>  <br>Your core deck isn't going to tell you if that heart means his actual, bleeding heart or some spiritual shit.<br>I also never said anything about using only kanjidamage, I even said it makes it easier for actual vocab.</br></br>  Guys, what's a decent plot-driven voiced VN that has the same level of Japanese as Grisaia?  So, how far have you guys gotten in kanjidamage/rtk anyway?  <br> Sometimes, it means person, though <br>It's shit alright.</br></br>  <br>Haven't you learned anything from your anime?<br>What the fuck do you even watch them for</br></br>  <br>I finished RTK1 about 2 years ago.</br>  <br>Are you a kanji master now</br>  <br>こと doesn't mean person under any circumstance.<br><br> Haven't you learned anything from your anime? <br> What the fuck do you even watch them for <br>kek. Now I know you're just starting out or retarded.</br></br></br></br></br>  1. Find a word with a Kanji you don't know even if it's just a word like 目. Read things or flip through Kanji in Context at random intervals.<br>2. Get a few words with it in them<br>3. Add the words to a vocab deck, with meaning and reading on the back<br>4. Add the same words to a Kanji deck in Kana only with a stroke order diagram on the back<br>5. Write those fuckers out from memory like you are a schoolgirl. This will be in the 漢検. What do you mean you don't intend to pass it?<br>6. Learn vocab, rough meaning, readings and stroke order at the same time. This will also help you distinguish similar Kanji and break them down into parts, making it easier as the process goes on.<br>7. Look on in despair at the people only learning vocab or only learning a rough meaning and how to write them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>toilet paper etc</br>  <br>I learned kana 3 years ago.</br>  <br>Most likely not, since rtk1 doesn't include readings.</br>  <br>It also has wrong meanings.</br>    <br>No wonder people here never learn to speak Japanese.</br>  <br>Not really. But I know about 2.5k unique Kanji and learned their readings through vocabulary. RTK helped me to blaze through vocab with great retention at least<br><br><br>Right you are. But those are easy to learn with vocabulary.<br><br><br>It doesn't, it just doesn't have all of them. A keyword is just meant to be the "idea" of the Kanji, the meanings are given through context mostly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://play.google.com/store/apps/<wbr>details?id=jp.co.imagineer.kanken.n<wbr>ankyu<br>And show us the results</br></wbr></wbr></br>  So /djt/, how long have y'all been learning Japanese? I just started and I figure I'm in for a few years of work but I'm curious what level y'all are at and how long it too y'all to get there  <br>So retarded? You're 3 years in and you thought こと meant person.</br>  <br> y'all </br>  <br>I did one year, learned to speak decently knew some kanji, then I just quit and didn't do shit for about a year and had to start all over again (why am I so retarded?)<br>So I guess I'm 4 years in, but with 3 years of studying</br></br>  <br>I don't know what to tell you.<br>Maybe once you read a few novels on your own you will get it.<br>Kanjidamage is the best learning resource for kanji.</br></br></br>  <br>  I just quit and didn't do shit for about a year and had to start all over again (why am I so retarded?) <br>I did the same the first time I tried learning back in like 2007, wost mistake of my life. I got decently far then stopped randomly and forgot literally everything, even kana. Getting back into it seriously now, but I still beat myself up over stopping then because I could be so good at the language right now if I had just kept up with it.<br><br>Never again, I refuse to to sleep now unless I got a decent amount of study time in that day.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What's the deal with this? I saw some people being autistic as fuck about it the other day, but it also seemed like it left a strong impression in them so it sparked my curiosity.</br>  <br>A year and a half and I'm already reading Dies Irae.<br><br>:^)</br></br></br>  <br> Maybe once you read a few novels on your own you will get it. <br>Already did that but thanks for your concern.</br></br>  <br> I don't know what to tell you. <br>You're still defending こと = person, really?</br></br>  <br><br>It was a blatant reference to things like 彼のこと. It was written in the example. I'm not sure which one of you is misinterpreting it.</br></br>  <br>That's sad to hear, but don't beat yourself up too much over it. <br><br>My best advice is to speak with people, at least if you where on a conversational level when you stopped. <br>I managed to get back on track in about 2 months of skype calling random japanese people, after that I just read a lot of books.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The 彼 is the person. The text is saying that こと is the part that holds the quality of person.</br>  <br><br>I keep quitting then restarting and taking breaks. I'm quite far in but I too beat myself over how I would be fluent by now had I kept at it.<br><br>Ultimately like you said all we can do is say fuck it and do it properly this time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The text = KD</br>  <br> 彼のこと <br>pretty sure that's supposed to be interpreted as something like "his"</br></br>  <br> 何年か <br>see 何か or whatever pronoun that's interrogative<br> ついでのチョコ <br>it's not the grammar that matters here. what do you think 'spare chocolate' is?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Three years or something. Probably one year of actual hard studying. Then I sort of lost interest in anime and all that. I regret spending thousands of hours on reading/watching translations before starting because it's hard to find something I enjoy these days. It's all the same shit so I just end up dropping it mid way and pick something new up every time</br>  <br>Maybe you should look at your study habits, are you doing too much at once and using "I don't have time to use x hours to study today, so I won't study at all" excuse? <br>What I've found works best for me is to decide to open your book/anki/whatever every day, even if you don't get in more than 5 minutes that's enough. Some days you'll do half a page or 10 flashcards, some days you'll do a lot more but the important thing is that you don't stop.</br></br>  <br>Closer to "about him" or "his circumstances" or more generally the thing he represents (which in English the most natural way to translate it is simply "he").</br>  <br>Nobody wants to learn anything, people just want to prove RTK/KD is good/bad. <br><br>It's funny because they speak as if learning kanji was actually a super difficult task that requires some sort of special technique to learn, when in fact it's 99% patience and perseverance regardless of the method you use. At the end of the day the only thing that really matters is a single number called average number of kanji learned in a day. Questions like with or without the readings, learning radicals beforehand or not and through vocab or individually make little difference in the long run since you're going to pick it all up along the way regardless of the path you chose, and learning kanji is a pretty long run by definition.  (No, just because you didn't take your precious time to learn each radical separately it doesn't mean you will confuse 持 with 待. A person who does that sort mistake is just being lazy and not paying enough attention to the shape of the kanji they're learning. You'll learn all the radicals and their meaning just fine as you learn the kanji provided you're not lazy or an idiot.) <br><br>The only exception is stroke order and actual writing in general. You have to make a conscious effort to learn those, but for somebody who's already learning to read it's only a matter of adding a little more effort if you care really.<br><br>But why do I bother? RTK shills preach that book like a fucking religion. Reason is powerless against them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sooner or later everyone realizes anime is shit.</br>  This thread is just a giant fucking blog.  <br>You mean people who are shit at japanese get sick of it because they're stuck watching awful subtitles.</br>  <br>The subtitles are often pretty good, it's the content that is shit.</br>  <br> WK anki deck <br><br>Where do you even get this?</br></br></br>  <br>I won't claim anime is great but it's a hell of a lot better than the alternatives. If you think anime is bad but you watch niconico or variety shows or dorama then your taste is worse than dogshit.</br>  <br>The point where you half-way understand the speech and have that annoy you while you're trying to read the subtitles, which are off timing wise, to actually understand something is the worst.</br>  <br>I don't have flash and I don't even watch my country's TV, I wouldn't stoop down to the level of watching jap drama.</br>  <br>I barely ever get immersed in anything I read/watch because I've been into this shit for like 10 years. Last VN I enjoyed was Subahibi and last anime was HxH. I just force myself to read so I can get better at Japanese</br>  <br>1) Download the subtitle file from kitsunekko<br>2) Read the whole thing over<br>3) Watch the anime without any subtitles<br>4) Repeat until you get most of it</br></br></br></br>  <br> which are off timing wise <br>You mean the different sentence order?</br></br>  <br><br>This is my nightmare.  Though to be fair I'm more into games and manga than anime so maybe it will be less shit. </br></br>  <br>Some people just want cheap escapism.</br>  <br>Thanks a lot.<br><br>Yeah, even if they're correct meaning wise, what you hear and what you read at any moment will be different.</br></br></br>  <br>I also stopped watching anime for the most part when I was really reading a lot, but now that I can read at a near native level and can actually enjoy anime raw it's a lot more fun again.<br><br>The people saying anime is shit are just being faggots acting trying to act special. It's just Sturgeons law - yes, MOST of it is shit, but if you can't find 2-3 things you enjoy each season then you just aren't trying.</br></br></br>  <br>I imagine you have a reason for learning Japanese besides Japanese media. Because if not, that would be pretty sad.</br>  <br>Why did you use spoiler tags for that?</br>  <br>My objective is to find a job in Japan, earning 25000000 yen a year starting with my 10/10 Mechanical Engineering skills<br>Then I will use that money to buy or build a big, luxurious house just outside a big city. Those places are subhuman nests but they are also very convenient to be near to.<br>While I'm at it, I will also attempt to find that cute girl you only find in 1 out of 100 japs and make her my gf.<br><br>Of course, I am not the poster you were replying to.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to fuck qts when I go to Japan on vacation. Also because learning Japanese is like lifting for me.</br>  <br>I hate it when people bring up the reason they're learning Japanese, because it reminds me that I don't have one.</br>  <br>Finding a job and a 1/100 girl is the only one of those you're likely to manage doing, as long as you're not fat.</br>  <br> needing a reason to do things <br>Just do things cause its fun</br></br>  <br>Because I want to be the very best that noone ever was.<br><br>To learn all the kanji is my real test, to write them is my cause</br></br></br>  <br>imagine how many qts you could fuck you if you were fluent in Japanese, looked good and used this app while living in Japan</br>  <br>That's not going to happen, and I realize I sound like a dick, but I'm just going to be honest here. First of all, all of the certifications you've received for engineering are worthless. Yes, your degree has some value, but no one would be willing to hire you from that alone. Just for comparison, imagine a hospital in the U.S. hiring a Chinese guy who claims to be fluent in English but only has some certification from some Chinese University. It would never happen.

You have to specifically delete the つ and retype it. Why. Just why.</br></br>  <br>That's quite the logic you're displaying.</br>  How many decks are you doing at once? I'm still doing the core 6k deck but I've been thinking about dropping that and doing the Yotsubato deck (from the reading pack) and following that while reading the actual manga. Something about doing two vocab decks at once makes me think it's a bad idea.  <br> But why do I bother? RTK shills preach that book like a fucking religion. Reason is powerless against them. <br>When I see RTK shills, they're usually defending their method. "Learn through vocab" shills, KD shills, and "Write the kanji 50 times each" shills seem to be offended by RTK and openly attack it. I wonder why the difference?</br></br>  <br><br>Can't remember where I first saw it, but that's how it was.</br></br>  <br>Okay, it's usually all kana though. That way just looks awkward.</br>  <br> いいセンスをお持ちですね <br>I don't think this is grammatical. Maybe something like あなたにはいいセンスだ or something would be better.</br></br>  <br><br> You have to make a conscious effort to learn those, but for somebody who's already learning to read it's only a matter of adding a little more effort if you care really. <br><br>That's the problem really.<br>Some people are here to actually learn how to communicate in Japanese. Not just to read. If I wanted to read Manga I guess I would just bum-rush the Kanji. But I don't. I want to immerse myself entirely in the language as a native can.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.google.com/search?q=”をお<wbr>持ちです”<br><br>  あなたにはいいセンスだ <br>This doesn't make sense.</br></br></br></wbr></br>  Sorry for the dumb question, but what purpose does the と in はっきり言うと hold?  <br>Conditional</br>  <br>Why not?</br>  <br>には just doesn't work there<br><br>This said, I don't think センス is the best word for what I wanted to say, but I can't think of what would be better atm.</br></br></br>  <br>You would never hear a Japanese person say that.</br>  <br>I thought that at first, but it didn't make sense. I think it's the adverbial kind of と.</br>  <br><br>I get the feeling you're not giving full context.</br></br>  <br>No, it's the conditional と<br>It doesn't have to be as formatted as "If A then B". It can be more like "Doing A, B" like it is in はっきりいうと</br></br>  <br>give the entire sentence please.<br><br>it seems conditional though. like "if i speak frankly..." which means that と here is technically conditional. even though the entire phrase works like an adverb.</br></br></br>  I cant seem to remember any grammar rules that arent incredibly basic for more than a hour, Should I just keep reading through the guides or just start them over again till it sticks  <br>はっきり言うと、あなたの言っていることは無意味です.<br>はっきり言うと、私は彼と一緒に働きたくありません。<br><br><br>Thanks, I think I get it now.</br></br></br></br></br>   spend 5 minutes trying to look up だーゆ or だゆ, knowing that the ゆ is gonna be 油 <br> it's ラー油 <br>FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU</br></br>  <br>Nayrs?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br><br>I didn't get any hits for the full sentence, but just searching "にはいいセンス" gives results, and the results that aren't quotes notably seem to be with words with 的 suffixes on the pages I looked through, but there were other nouns too. Why wouldn't it work with あなた? There was also 1 (one) result for 君 and three (3) for 私.</br></br>  <br>You'd have to post the sentences with 君/私<br>But there's a huge difference between putting the thing you have good sense with before には, and putting the person who is supposed to have that sense before には. The links I see are all the former.</br></br>  https://archive.moe/a/thread/127799<wbr>44<br>I remember there were threads like these back in the good old days when /djt/ was not centralized yet.</br></wbr>  I'm at about 2k words into the 2k/6k deck and I've never practiced writing anything. How important is it to start writing kanji and kana if I plan on living in japan for an extended amount of time? I've also noticed when trying to recall kanji, I can get the general shape right, but the exact strokes evade me.

Soon switching back to work on the Intermediate section of the Dictionary of Japanese Grammar documentation. <br>Kanji deck statistics: <br>2141 individual kanji <br>100% coverage (according to Kanji Grid) of general and new general use kanji, 5 non-jouyou.<br> <br>Differences between this and older deck/s: <br>Inclusion of keywords for all kanji. Keywords obtained from WWWJDICT. Also on the rear side, the kanji themselves are embedded with a hyperlink to the related kanji page on Jisho.<br><br>Vocab deck for this kanji deck, I've still got a bit of work to do with the audio but will be loading that to the mediafire account linked in the offline page in the DJT website. The audio database being used for the words is the one WWWJDICT/Jisho, etc. use; the audio corpus supplied by the vocal talent at Jpod101. The collection includes audio for some 130 odd thousand words however out of the 8,500 odd words in the deck, there are around 1,500 for with audio simply does not exist within the audio bank. I've had a look at using Google translate for their audio but it sounds too robotic. Maybe at some later point. <br>The statistics for that deck in terms of kanji is 2352 total unique kanji. Covers all the 常用漢字、常用漢字、123 non-jouyou, 1 varient 人名用 and 92 regular 人名用漢字. <br>After uploading that the next step before switching entirely to the DoJG content is to upload a combined deck of both, as to be used as a single "program", if you will. That is, every 4 or so words the next card will be the kanji production style card. This was it sort of forces the user to be able to recognise and produce the kanji being used, while progressing through the deck. It is based on a frequency corpus but there are many kanji which simply do not fall into the remit of commonality.<br><br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/e<wbr>j66ml1fw3ccupo/%E5%A4%A7%E6%BC%A2%E<wbr>5%AD%97.apkg</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why the hell are hiragana and meanings on the FRONT of the card? Or is this a production deck?</br>  <br>It's clearly a kanji deck. Which means putting the kanji on the back. I think it's a great idea personally. I never did RTK because fuck learning through stupid English keywords, but I'd be much happier learning to write by actually putting words on the front.<br><br>In fact I think I'll download it right now, get rid of the English field, and start doing 5 a day.</br></br></br>  <br>OK so I've thought about it some more and I think it's basically "Look, the conclusion [from my look] is that I'm taking the role of boyfriend, right?" Can anyone confirm?</br>  <br>I think the idea is it's a kanji deck.<br>So you look at those four kana words and try to recall 孫, the one kanji common to all four.<br><br><br>you may want to keep the english meaning so you don't wind up with 46 kanji all named しゅう</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you may want to keep the english meaning so you don't wind up with 46 kanji all named しゅう <br>It has 4 words on the front, not just a single reading. It should be enough to know what kanji it is and if not I'll just change one of the words to something more distinctive.</br></br>  <br>Hmm, it's not showing the stroke order for me like it does in that pic. Is this just a version thing?</br>  <br>Sorry about the delayed response. I'll direct link to the earlier posts explaining the deck/s in question: <br><br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128274<wbr>928/#128307225<br><br><br> you may want to keep the english meaning so you don't wind up with 46 kanji all named しゅう <br>The deck is designed to be used alongside the vocab deck it is based on, found here: <br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/a<wbr>q8g6conv8rw6rb/%E5%A4%A7%E6%BC%A2%E<wbr>5%AD%97%E8%AA%9E%E5%BD%99.apkg<br>The above isn't fully updated that. In the process of adding the remaining audio at the moment. <br><br>After that I'll be nutting out a combined deck of the two, in order for the process to be more streamlined. As it stands at the moment the two decks have a set of deck options which matches each other, that is: the vocab deck feeds 20 words and the kanji deck feeds 5. This is four entries in the vocab deck which correspond with the words on used on the kanji deck. <br><br><br>Shit, may bad. You need the stroke orders font. Here: <br>http://www.nihilist.org.uk/<br>https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u<wbr>/39004158/KanjiStrokeOrders_v3.001.<wbr>zip</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> Shit, may bad. You need the stroke orders font <br>Cool thanks. Time to see how many cards I can go through today.</br></br>  <br><br>Shit this a lot like the one I made for myself except 10x better.</br></br>  <br>Something didn't have enough room to add initially: someone looking to use the vocab and kanji decks combined, a note of caution: it may be apt to go through at least core2k if you are very fresh to Japanese. Due to the nature of the kanji, the numbers of words for each entry, and the attempt at not repeat vocab (there are repeats but hopefully not too much) the deck doesn't really cover the "core" most frequent words used in newspaper. <br>One effect this has had that a kanji maybe a thousand or so places down the line may use rather uncommon or 'difficult' words due to most/all of the common words being used prior with other kanji. <br><br>The primary corpus used was based on Japanese Google blogs, as an Internet based common usage. This had about 450,000 words. Internet common usage does not reflect the Core decks, unfortunately. There were also many kanji/words which were taken from Jisho due to not having enough entries in the corpus. What can be said is that the contents of the deck may be rather eclectic. That is, you will see words like 一番, words like 滑稽諧謔, words like 離愁, words like 勤める, words like 手淫, words like 仮想機械, and words like 自動車損害賠償責任保険. It can be rather unpredictable so I suppose if you are after a more straight forward vocab deck to break into reading, this might not be the most enjoyable and you may prefer to use one of the already great pure kanji decks like the kanji damage or remember the kanji ones.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 自動車損害賠償責任保険 <br>It's interesting that this is considered a single word</br></br>  <br> 字 as あざ instead of じ <br> no そら for 空 <br> し for 四 but no よん <br>These are the weirdest things I saw in the first ~40<br>I guess only the first is really weird.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>reference: https://<span>youtu.be/KxGRhd_iWuE  [ ]</br>  <br>Single Jisho/Rikaisama entry. <br><br><br>Yeah, sorry about that. All of the words were added by means of hovering over the kanji with rikaisama and hitting save. Initially used the Kenkyuusha 5th edition with Epwing2Anki but that was not only just as inaccurate with the readings- providing what you have described- but completely failed to pick up multitudes of words and was more frustrating than anything else. It was a compromise.</br></br></br></br>  <br>real simple something like "I'm supposed to be the boyfriend right?" so yes, you got it bb</br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tYz<wbr>MYcUty6s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Np, it's pretty awesome anyway. I can keep track of the things I think are the weirdest as I go through the deck if that would help, and post them all at once when I finish.</br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br>That would be awesome if you could do that. Will definitely have to insert those corrections at some point. On another note the vocab twin of this deck has just finished uploading: <br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/x<wbr>6k0jvqvv0yqj7x/%E5%A4%A7%E6%BC%A2%E<wbr>5%AD%97%E8%AA%9E%E5%BD%99.apkg<br>大漢字語彙.apkg <br>It is sitting at 73.4 MB. Out of the 8565 cards, 977 of them are missing audio- the JDICT/jpd101 database doesn't have any recording for them, unfortunately. <br>There are also 22 blank cards as filler to make up for the 4:1 ratio to maintain review integrity for the two decks. These blank cards boiled down to two events: 1, running out of unique words for the kanji and 2. simply not having the words for the kanji. From memory there are about five or six instances where I simply could not find 4 words with the given kanji. One of the non-general use kanji for instance has a single entry in the major online dictionaries and I found another entry on a Japanese wikipedia page. <br><br>There are some names used in the deck but I tried to keep those extremely limited as learning words, while useful, isn't exactly a reliable method of picking up common kanji readings due to the nature of 人名用漢字 readings.</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> interrogative <br>Did you mean indefinite? か turns interrogatives into indefinites.<br><br>いつ is interrogative.

Fuck Daiz.</br></br></br>  <br>Doki is awesome imo<br>their encodes are the best and their xdcc bots have the best speeds</br></br>  <br> nyaatorrents </br>  <br>DeadFish (for all proper sub groups)/BakedFish (for all HS) from the OP<br>RightShiftBy2<br>AnimeRG<br>NoobSubs <br>from <br>and AE from <br><br>are all .mp4 hardsub re-encoders for people who either have shitty laptops or watch on something other than a PC</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> UTW <br>Dead, UBW BD are gonna be their last project and they didn't pick up anything this season.<br> Underwater <br>They "Delayed"  dropped  Gansta because "their editor went missing"  they felt like it  . They didn't even release episode 3 yet</br></br></br></br>  <br>UTW is kill</br>  <br> hs, deafish and bakedfish aren't even fansub <br> commie is shit <br>Yeah, fansub is totally alive.</br></br></br>  <br><br>UTW died a few years ago when Raze went to med school.</br></br>  <br>Reencodes are important. Back around 2011 I didn't have my laptop, but I had access to a shitty early 2000s specs computer. It couldn't play video at 720p without lagging audio and/or subs, so I had to use 480p and most groups didn't release SD versions of shows. It was a life saver.</br>  <br> BakedFish <br> DeadFish <br> fansubbing <br>This chart is trash.</br></br></br></br>  I don't get it. Why is HS considered bad? And what's wrong with reencoders?<br><br>Though I am pretty ignorant of groups and I usually just download the most seeded torrent.</br></br>  <br>The thing you're forgetting is not the groups doing the work but the work itself that is actually getting processed. Half the shows airing right now have Funi/CR rips as the only available option.<br><br>Putting that aside, there are hardly any dependable groups left. At a glance, the only groups I would use from your list are Hiryuu, Vivid, FFF and Commie. I might give DDY a chance, but I've had issues with their releases before. Other than that, I would rather not wait for anything other than Funi/CR rips because they are usually timely and allow me to join in the discussion on /a/ without worrying about spoilers. Then again, sometimes I just skip the middleman altogether and go raw, but no one ever discusses "raw groups" here.</br></br></br>  <br>HS is direct rip. Its not a fansub. Its a rip.<br><br>re-encoders are not fansubs, they are re-encoders.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Probably best to not interpret this data too much given we're so early in the season.</br></br>  <br> Little Witch Academia: The Enchanted Parade <br><br>Wanna know how I know some anon is wondering why his minor in statistics isn't increasing his pay grade?</br></br></br>  <br> Rokka no Yuusha  <br> 2nd <br><br>why?</br></br></br></br>  Fansub wars are unbridled autism. <br><br>HS isn't as bad as people say it is and you know it. An somewhat uncommon fuck up or stupid shoehorned meme isn't that fucking bad of a thing. <br><br>I don't see why people hate FFF though. Other than the fact that they're slow. <br><br>Vivid is pretty nice.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why not count it? It's a show that aired this season. Sort of.</br></br>  <br>Dubs confirm.<br>and so do mine.</br></br>  <br>I like FFF. They're one of the best groups still operating, though slow releases can be frustrating sometimes it seems they are working on it.<br>It's always great to look for a previous season show and find that they subbed it.</br></br>  <br>FFF is slow as everlasting fuck and on top of that they just drop shows like it's nothing apparently.<br>Yeah, I learned my lesson last season.</br></br>  <br> HS isn't as bad as people say it is and you know it. <br>You kidding, CR and Funi are especially bad this season that there's no way you couldn't notice any problems, like one hour ago, someone made a Dandelion thread complaining about what turns out to be mistranslation on Funi's part.</br></br>  <br> 3588 <br>Poor Wooser.</br></br>  <br> HS isn't as bad as people say it is and you know it. <br>I think you got it wrong. There's no reason to say "HS is bad" because it's literally just a scraper bot. It's the original CR/Funi rips that are bad. Especially fucking Funi, Jesus Christ learn to typeset, Funi.</br></br>  Horriblesubs actually sub now? I thought they just rip from Crunchy and other sites?  Who cares about fansubs that take a week or two to release an episode. We've improved.  <br>Funi is a trash, they mistranslate like every second line, not to mention horrendous typeset/timing and hardsubbing bullshit.</br>  <br>And then here, their most recent release which already got delayed for several hours due to technical difficulties, they kept this sub blocking half the screen for more than a minute.</br>  <br>No, it's a comparing between HS and fansubbing.</br>  I really don't get what the big deal is.<br>Obviously when you say HS you mean the works that are downloaded from HS.<br><br>Unless for some reason you have a CR/Funi account, or unless HS is ripping thing from other places, this really shouldn't be an issue at all. I really do not understand.</br></br></br>  <br>Because of the strongest man in the world.</br>  <br>I will download Wooser right now.<br>And Miss Monochrome.<br><br>I've been meaning to catch up on more of the shorts this season anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot Gatchaman Crowds Insight</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128496945 <br>shup up, niwaka.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128496945 <br> moeshit <br> literally the worst show this season is top by those numbers <br> Argumentum ad Populum </br></br></br>  <br>Wait a second, why the fuck is God Eater at the top? I though no one ever heard of the game. Is is just because Ufotable?</br>  <br>It's one of the HS recommended anime for this season.<br>http://horriblesubs.info/2015/07/su<wbr>mmer-2015-donation-drive/</wbr></br></br>  <br>With a name like "God Eater", do you really think normalfags would let this out of their grasp?</br>  <br>most of these aren't even sub groups though<br>and the few that don't actually use CR scripts would more aptly be called maym groups</br></br>  <br>There's lies, damned lies, and statistics.</br>  <br> Even Logos has more downloads than Symphogeah <br>REEEEEEEE</br></br>  <br> Is is just because Ufotable? <br>That would be my guess. I checked it out because I never played the games and I was curious, but holy shit it was terrible. The artstyle looks like ass, the production value reminds me of Devil Survivor 2, and the MC is basically Cliche McEren II.</br></br>  <br><br>27000 per episode, it slipped through on account of having an episode 00.</br></br>  <br>It's horriblesubs only and CR wasn't simulcasting GX.</br>  Why do you say that HS is bad  <br>Why does God Eater have that many downloads?<br><br>I skimmed through the first episode only because God Eater has nice figs and ufotable, and it looked like shit and was instadropped.<br><br>Are the video games popular or something?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>read thread</br>  <br>That pic is just proving it's dead you fag<br>Is that the point of this thread?</br></br>  <br> action anime with unique visuals made by the Fate studio </br>  <br><br>Honestly, UTW starting due to the shitty DEEN UBW movie, and ending with the Ufotable UBW anime is something like poetry. <br><br>I'm glad it ended this way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>horriblesubs just get their subs from funimation though</br>  <br> Chihiro <br><br>They are still alive?

It seemed okay, but the episode fucked up near the end so I decided to not bother with them.</br>  How do I encode like Commie?  <br>figure out the most obscure codec and downlaod it</br>  <br>That's not even the worst of it. The latest Akagami episode had an error where the audio was mixed up with the audio for the next episode THAT DIDN'T EVEN AIR YET and they had to delay it.

Can someone less retarded please explain it for me?</br>  <br>From Daiz:<br><br> They broke the rules multiple times without getting the hint to stop doing it (uploaded a porn OVA to the worksafe frontend multiple times), which lead to them losing their trusted status. Then one of their members tried to take down the NyaaTorrents domain. He was caught with his pants down, and Doki then tried to claim that he didn't actually do anything and that his "e-mail was hacked" and whatnot (even though the person in question had exclaimed multiple times how he hates Nyaa and ran his own tracker, yes, clearly he wouldn't do something like this out of pettiness). This is what got them banned from the site. <br><br> For years they claimed the person in question did nothing wrong, though a while back someone from Doki finally admitted that the guy was indeed behind it. <br><br> (Albeit the group leader has continued to insist the guy did nothing wrong even after the previous case, so it seems like the official party of line of Doki continues to deny reality) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Boo-fucking-hoo. If your site can be hacked by a bunch of chinese cartoon transcriptionists, then build a better security backend, fucking faggot.<br><br>I thought you were supposed to be good with anime technology, Daiz.</br></br></br>  This is the worst season yet and I say that every summer which means, as I thought, anime's getting exponentially worse<br><br>Would you want to carry on fansubbing?<br><br>I thought not</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you blame a store when a nigger robs it? <br><br>You fuckers look for anything to hate Based Baldy.</br></br></br>  <br> idiots who think HS is an actual sub group <br>Nobody thinks that you autistic shit, Horriblesubs subbing is just a joke everyone plays along with.</br></br>  <br> hs <br> fansubbing <br>lel</br></br></br>  <br>Is DAOEMO DOMO?<br><br>If so pretty cool.</br></br></br>  <br>bunch of fucking ledgends</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128497344 <br>Fucking homosexuals, thinking their opinion counts.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128497344 <br>It's liked in the only place that matters</br>  <br>The game was really well known around...2011-2012? But it dropped off the map, at least in the West, after it had been out for a while.<br><br>Frankly, it's odd that it's getting an anime years later without more media keeping it in the public eye all this time. It's probably got a sequel in the pipe I don't know about.</br></br></br>    i like how nobody bothers to mention that HS releases 3 encodes of the same show at different resolutions, basically rendering the pie chart null and void. If you took out 2/3 of HS pie, THEN you'd be left with a more realistic result.<br><br> it would still be bigger than the other subgroups, but it wouldn't look as big on the pie chart. </br></br>  I can understand why when fansubbing groups are always so fucking behind on everything. Before it was tolerable to wait 2-3 days for quality subs, now i'll be two weeks behind or more waiting for fansubs.  <br>H&amp;D is missing from that breakdown. They're the ones subbing Symphogear so that we don't need to deal with Commie.</br>  <br><br>Why would you take out 2/3 of the hs pie? It's counting total DL. You could make the case that if you joined the 3 ones together you'd end up with more horrible sub volume because they'd have such massive dl counts individually.</br></br>  <br>Except the chart is going by downloads, not the number of encodes. Having multiple encodes that only differ in resolution does nothing to inflate how many downloads a group receives. If someone downloads HS 720p, they're not downloading the 480p and 1080p as well.<br><br>Dumbass.</br></br></br>    <br>Doki is fine. I'm watching their Dandelion release since<br> Funimation </br></br>  <br>Doki is almost trollsub tier when they're not using another groups script for BDs. Still better than Funi sadly.</br>  <br> That many people still watching Overlord <br>There is going to be a sword art every anime season just like there is still a K-on every anime season.<br>That is disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br>At first I was pleasantly surprised when I woke up today to see a completed CD 3 from DDY on my download log. My thought was "wow, they're on time this week." Then I realized that this week is episode 4, not 3.</br>  WHO MAZUI HERE   Deadfish <br> Bakedfish <br> A lot of fansubbers left out <br><br>It's dead as fuck. Also like 90% of those "fansubs" are just slightly changed CR with some fancy karaoke</br></br></br></br>  <br> Doki <br> fine <br>you mean they use a simulcast script as-is</br></br></br>  <br>Remind me why the fuck are you counting HS and reencode releases separately?</br>  <br> Underwater </br>  <br>And so is Cthuko who are the best subs out there for a bunch of series (DanMachi, Yozakura Quartet, Shirobako, Gatchaman)</br>  <br>Mazui haven't released anything in years, and considering how many fucks Ulrez gives about fansubbing these days, they're not gonna do anything anymore either.<br><br>(Joint with UTW for Railgun S3 doesn't count.)</br></br></br>  <br> Every successful action anime is Sword Art <br> Every successful SoL is K-on <br>lmao</br></br></br>  <br>Well speed aside, some people just prefer HS for everything they watch for whatever reason, so they'd even wait for rips that come out after fansub releases.</br>  <br> still comparing Overlord to SAO </br>  <br> That's not even the worst of it <br>Yeah, I know, but I'm just pointing out the most recent cases just to invalidate the "hurr cherrypicking" card.</br></br>  <br> It's not the culprit's fault that the victim was so easy to kill </br>  <br> tried to take Nyaa down <br> tried to <br>I remember that, they attempted a DDoS that failed miserably</br></br></br>  This file was getting a bit dusty from lack of use, so here we go.  <br>And, of course.</br>   this thread <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sIl<wbr>NIVXpIns</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Are these the new Stalker threads? I think we need some regular shitposters to make them more entertaining.<br><br> Commie <br>People won't shut up about them regardless the quality (or lack thereof) of their subs. Thank you based Commie for all the butthurt you create.<br><br> FFF <br>If the inquisition from Baka to Test were real they would take them down for getting so much attention despite being a slower and shittier version of Commie.<br> b-but who's going to sub my shitty LN adaptations? <br><br> UTW <br>More like Unlimited Translations for Weebs. Meanwhile, Raze is enjoying the donations money with his bitch.<br><br> Vivid <br>Another Commie-lite.<br> b-but check this blog post where they say they are totally not commie! <br><br> DameDesuYo <br>If I wanted ESL subs I'd just watch Hadena AKA CabbageSubs.<br><br> caffeine <br>gg puddi.<br><br> GJM <br>Catchy name you chose there you britbong, one day you'll lead a good and big group.<br><br> Cthuko <br>Not bad if you don't mind waiting two years for your subs.<br><br> Underwater <br>Do I even need to say anything?<br><br>Fansubbing is finally dead, thank you God for simulcasts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Fansubbing was only a thing because there was no way to understand anime otherwise as a gaijin. This chart shows that an overwhelming majority of anime watchers don't give two fucks about translation difference or fansub drama, they just want to watch some anime with halfway decent subtitles.<br><br>Fansubbing is only alive where it has always been. In shows that don't have a proper sub. Also to anyone complaining about the translations of Funi and CR, they literally had job openings on a dozen different online job sites a few weeks ago. Literally anyone semi qualified could have landed a job.</br></br>  <br> REEEEEEEE <br>You forgot your shitty frog image nigger.</br></br>  <br>There are two kinds of fansubbers who don't quit: the likes of Commie, who just do whatever for teh lulz and shit out tons of trollage every season,<br>and people like that EveTaku guy (had the name of some pokemon iirc) or the guys at Cthuko who just sub because they like it, produce quality but slow as fuck.<br><br>Then there's the anomaly called Vivid who just fail to fit in.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know, just because someone knows Japanese and can translate, or can time a 24 minute show, or typeset with Aegisub, doesn't mean they want to get a shitty paid job at CR with horrible schedules and retarded limitations.</br>  <br>I'd rather get paid to fansub within guidelines than do it for free the way I want for a shit fanbase.  It's why I stopped scanlating. </br>  <br>That's you. The people in group 2 of this faggot  will rather do it their way, for free, for fun.</br>  <br> The people in group 2 of this faggot  will rather do it their way, for free, for fun <br><br>How's group 2 different from Commie?</br></br></br>  <br>Are you actually asking how are slow but proper releases different from fast memesubs?</br>  <br> He thinks that those people aren't already working for CR/Funi </br>  <br> bunch of groups editing HS scripts <br> bunch of meme trollsubs <br> thinks fansubbing is 'healthy' </br></br></br>  <br>And you would have preferred what exactly, for that line?</br>  <br> otaku guy literally talking about his waifu in the weeb sense <br> /a/ complains <br>I don't have a face</br></br></br>  <br>No, I'm asking you how are they different when every group subs shit their way, for free and for fun, what you consider a troll release is what Commie and whoever downloads them believe is a proper release.</br>  <br><br>When did I say there was anything wrong with that line. The person I'm responding to seems to think that people working for fansub groups aren't working for Crunchy Roll and Funimation already.</br></br>  <br>My mistake, I was multitasking too much.</br>  <br>Are you sure they are subbing for fun, and not some weird sense of duty? Why else would so many of them fall out, burned out and hating the whole shit? Just think about what a bitter bitch the gg leader is when it comes to fansubs...</br>  <br>Basically all of CR staff consists of former fansubbers. Since when is that any news? But as far as I know, very few people do it parallel</br>  <br> But as far as I know, very few people do it parallel <br>Oh buddy.</br></br>  <br>CR cracks down on that shit real hard from what I hear, do you have anything to support saying otherwise?</br>  <br> CR cracks down hard on that shit <br> Now tell me everything you know about it <br><br>Oh buddy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah there's definitely something like that too (see UTW) but even then I don't think you would keep picking up shows every season and spend hours on this if you didn't get some kind of enjoyment out of it, even if it's minimal.</br>  <br>Oh buddy. (Go back to work, CR peon.)</br>  <br> purchase war bonds <br>Gets me every time.</br></br>  <br>Why couldn't they hire competent ones then? why dont they don't they translate the fucking lyrics?</br>  <br><br> Rokka no Yuusha <br>Who the fuck watches that?<br><br>Literally the only show this season I dropped on the first episode.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> why the fuck is God Eater at the top? <br><br>Underboob.</br></br></br>  <br>I can't understand it myself, but there seem to be people who hate it and just keep doing it for some mysterious reason. I don't know. E-peen? The community? Addiction? No idea.</br>  <br>Because competent translators can get way better jobs way better paid than CR ever could offer.</br>  <br>  the MC is basically Cliche McEren II. <br><br>HAving just played the game, I'm surprised they put an MC in at all, considering he has 0 presence or impact in the game, they could have removed him and had Soma be the main character instead without any issue.<br><br>Or they could have kept the MC, and given him the power of grinding like a motherfucker to have the best Arcs.<br><br>But instead, we get this shitty generic tryhard. Oh well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   complaining about CR staff when their in-house translations tend to be the best they have to offer <br><br>Wow I feel like I have to make some school over here. CrunchyRoll HARDLY subs anything, they are just a streaming platform for Aniplex, Media Factory, Toho, Pony Canyon and others and guess what? These publishers make their own subs and give CR their own videos!<br>Ever wondered why Aniplex's videos are so fucking good while something from Toho looks really bad? Because Aniplex has competent encoders! Why do the videos from Media Factory are so choppy? Because those faggots don't know what ITVC is. And so on.</br></br></br>  <br> They "Delayed"   dropped  Gansta because "their editor went missing"  they felt like it  .<br><br>Are you fucking shitting me.<br><br>Daiz, because I know you have your little bitch bot desperately pinging you every time your name gets brought up, you are a fucking sack of shit. First you do this with the Saki BDs, then Lagrange, now Gangsta. I hope you fucking drop dead.</br></br></br></br></br>  During the golden age of fansubbing which group was considered the best?  <br>Triad</br>  <br>GG. UTW.</br>  <br>gg or mazui tbh</br>  <br>And when they learn how to typeset in a way that doesn't make fansubs look ridiculously better by comparison I'll give a shit about CR.</br>  <br>see<br><br>(Spoiler: Duwang.)</br></br></br>  <br>Shitani.</br>  <br>DragonSuper is a reencode group that specifically does Dragonball Super and nothing else.</br>  <br><br>I was so sad when they died. I used to just watch whatever they would release and was never let down. Until Nanoha.<br><br>Also what was that group that did the early One Piece? I haven't been able to watch any One Piece anime ever since they died.</br></br></br></br>  <br>AnimeJunkies</br>  <br>gg</br>  <br>Anything but gg who popularised meme subs.</br>  <br>gg literally trolled nothing but Hidan no Aria since 2010</br>  <br>Whatever happened to UTW and Underwater?</br>  <br>mistranslations and overlocalizations are a form of memesubbing<br><br>commie knows this very well</br></br></br>    <br> God Eater, Rokka no Yuusha, GATE, and OverLord that high <br>How?</br></br>  <br>OverLord is actually good.</br>  <br>Dattebayo</br>  <br><br>All of those are good, especially if you haven't read the VNs.</br></br>  <br> OMG there are bad words in my subs they must be trollan <br><br><br>No, they aren't. That'd make literally every fansub and simulcast release memesubs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Eclipse.</br>  <br>Kaizoku. Almost TV Nihon-tier weebsubs. Watch Funirips instead.</br>  <br> That'd make literally every fansub release memesubs. <br><br>You might be onto something! good job faggot</br></br></br>  There would be more fansubs groups if the anime industry hadn't gone to shit.<br>Literally nothing worth watching the last 3 seasons.</br>  <br> No, they aren't. That'd make literally every fansub and simulcast release memesubs. <br>Yes, they are. And yes, plenty of simulcast releases ARE memesubs.</br></br>  <br><br>They worked great with One Piece. I wouldn't want that with any other anime.</br></br>    <br>I second the motion.</br>  <br>Bleach subs were awesome.</br>  <br>No, there wouldn't.<br><br>The reason why there aren't more fansub groups is because the vast majority of people simply doesn't care enough about sub quality to wait and fansubs can't compete with simulcasts in terms of speed.<br><br>Since fansubbers are all attention whores hungry to get their e-peens stroked they don't bother because they don't get enough popularity.<br><br>That is literally the only reason.<br><br>If simulcasts were to die, people would start subbing again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You don't know what "meme" means</br></br>  <br>Looks like YOU are the one who doesn't.</br>    <br>YOU are the one who doesn't know what meme means. If you insert lol so randum meme references into your subs then you're delivering meme subs. Not to mention unnecessary localisations for the only purpose of pissing people off.</br>  <br>You just got used to it due to it being the only alternative, anon.<br>I thought they were fine back then too, but looking back at that shit now I have no idea what I was thinking.</br></br>  <br>Fall '12 was the last season anything interesting came out.</br>  <br>I was saddened when I didn't see tham picking up the new season of Working. They were prerty much the only group I could find for Season 1's release</br>  <br>Maybe you should simply stop watching anime, clearly it's not for you any more. Leaving /a/ would be a good idea too, and killing yourself like the worthless subhuman you are while you're at it.</br>  <br>Fuck off Commie dev.</br>  What was the last show that had multiple "big" fansub groups working on it? Kill la Kill?  <br>No Game No Life.</br>  <br>Lol wut? U mad?</br>  <br/>  <br>Nice meme pic you memefag.</br>  <br><br> ITVC <br><br>?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck Seattle.</br>  <br/>  Commie Devs are laughing at us again.  So what's the official /a/ approved sub groups to use now?  <br>Commie.</br>  <br>BakedFish and Ironanjuu.</br>  Remember when fansub groups used to have only 1 or 2 translators meaning that no matter what they released, the quality of the subs would be the same? Remember when the name of the group actually meant something? It's not like that anymore. Fansub groups have many translators nowadays, some of which don't work on X show each season which has its advantages and disadvantages.<br><br>Advantages: many more shows get subbed a lot faster; one group can simultaneously work on multiple projects.<br>Disadvantages: wildly fluctuating quality coming from the same sub group. The same group that you liked from last season may be complete garbage this season because there's a different translator working on this season's shows. Essentially, the group name itself is no longer relevant; there is a loss of consistent quality across releases. You'd have to look up the translators' names for each show to make some sort of objective comparison and who wants to do that? Remembering faggots' names like Daiz and herkz should not be grounds for picking one sub group over another but alas, this is the reality of modern fansubbing.<br><br>Which of these situations would you rather have?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Horriblesubs, and Deadfish if you're on mobile.</br>  <br> FFF <br> Baka to Test <br><br>Are you fucking telling me that's why they are called FFF?</br></br></br></br>      <br> Decide to wait for Hiryuu after mushroom was censored last ep <br> Still not there </br></br>  Despite how shit commie is, no other sub group will divide their subs apart to not block a cleavage shot, or to pan subs away to make room for useless advertisement scrolling text.<br><br>Oh, why don't more sub groups include commercial breaks?

I'd watch the commercial breaks in a majority of shows if they were included.</br>  <br>I would rather prefer what we have now. Back then 1 translator going MIA for a day or two meant everything was delayed from that group.<br><br>Back then you memorized faggots' names too, because every group always pointed fingers at someone in the group who was shitty at timing/typesetting/encoding/etc or overslept.</br></br></br>  <br> Hiryuu <br>I see what you did there.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128496945 <br>It's a good thing the preferences of foreign weeb plebs are irrelevant.</br>  Why is Underwater so shit?  Now that it's all over, can we all agree that Coalguys were the greatest fansub group of all time?  <br>No, that's CrunchySubs.</br>  <br><br>They aren't. They're the best fansub group right now.</br></br>  <br> Underwater: forced squid puns <br> FFF: no forced squid puns <br><br>I rest my case.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying squid puns weren't in the eventual R1 release </br>  <br> localizations are bad! </br>  <br><br> memesubbers <br><br>not evn once</br></br></br></br>  <br> localizations are memes <br><br>This board is hopeless.</br></br></br>  <br>then fuck off back to IRC with your circlejerk</br>  <br>It was a fucking terrible localisation, the worst I've ever seen, and yes I'm still mad.</br>  <br>She has a unique way of speaking.<br>I don't think just ignoring it is the best way to go about it, nor translating it literally or leaving "de geso" after an English sentence.<br><br>I can understand not liking the puns though. I like them in general, and it's a comedy series, so it's alright with me.</br></br></br></br>  <br> all these re-encoders and rippers <br> no anonymoose <br>This is offensive.</br></br></br>  <br>Competent translation with shitty editing. Translating sugoi as holy cow (in some Sidonia episode) isn't clever, it's reaching Commie level and I wouldn't be surprised if they were trying to get attention/make people mad with lines like this, though it's more pathetic than anything.</br>  <br>They're not even puns most of the time. They just obnoxiously jam squid related words into the sentence when in the original it's much more subtle and they are actually puns.</br>  <br>Do you have some issue with FFF, or do you only hate them because they sub at the speed it takes frozen molasses to travel uphill?</br>  <br>What is AnimeRG? Are they legit fansubs or crunchy edits?</br>  <br>They are if they make the original meaning unrecognizable</br>  <br>What, like the -ika in the episode titles and other questions</br>  <br>Surprise! Both the TL and editor for Sidonia are Commie/gg-core, your own fault for not knowing what you were getting into.</br>  She doesn't just randomly say "イカ" , she emphasises the イカ in words that contain it such as "じゃなイカ". You know, like a pun.  <br> nobody has heard of <br>What?<br> Chyuu-Migoto <br> Mezashite <br> Tsundere <br> AnimeRG <br>If you haven't heard of them you haven't watched enough Chinese cartoons. They're actually the best releases for a given sometimes.<br>Tsundere is outstanding when they actually decide to motivate their asses.<br><br>Anime Release Group.<br>Legit subs even though I don't really care for their typesetting. They only do 1080 dual audio releases.<br>XDCC downloads of every release is a nice touch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Meant for<br/></br>  <br>I know she doesn't just randomly say it. <br>That's no more punny than adding random ocean words by tweaking a few letters. In my opinion. I guess there's less of a leap in emphasizing what's already there than changing stuff to fit.<br>The JP puns are undoubtedly more squid related though, as opposed to ink/fish/krill/whatever.</br></br></br>  <br>AnimeRG isn't a fansub group, you dumbass. It's a remux group.</br>  <br> taking bait from the butthurt shill who got banned from NT </br>  <br>Who got banned? Details?</br>  <br> Oh, why don't more sub groups include commercial breaks? <br>Because a lot of them use CR as a video source anyway, so no grand sponsor day oh christmas or commercial breaks.</br></br>  <br> Notepad <br>Pleb</br></br>  <br> Was gg the only sub group who did that with the likes of Morning Lesque? <br>I preferred their quality work on Sacred Seven.</br></br>  <br> or to pan subs away to make room for useless advertisement scrolling text. <br>This is nice.<br>Sometimes I do laugh when they shrink the subs down as the ad scrolls at them, then the subs spins/flies off the screen.</br></br></br>  <br> ITVC <br><br>?</br></br></br>   Commie subs are bad <br> Horriblesubs are bad <br>My two favorite /a/ memes</br></br>  <br>But horrible subs are actually bad.</br>  <br>Flax is so low? Am I the only one who uses them regularly?</br>  <br>Commie and CR translations are hit or miss.<br><br>Commie encodes and typesetting are god tier.<br><br>Funi everything is bad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Inverse Telecine</br>  <br> And they said fansubbing was dead. <br><br>RE-Encodes of existing work do NOT count. So your pie chart is completely wrong. In addition, re-packaged copies of Crunchyroll or FUNimation should not count as they are not fansubs. They are commercially made products that someone copied and uploaded. <br><br>Actual fansubbing is dead as most of the CURRENT popular works with "fan released subtitles" are actually 98% based upon Crunchyroll's subtitles but have the text or font choice and position tweaked to be "better". <br><br>As for groups that do free (no charge or subscription) original fansubbing without using a commercially released subtitle, the most prominent group for that is Doremi which has even done subs for certain specific japanese live-action shows and documentaries. <br><br>Doremi is not liked by the Cartel because it opposed them, so you won't find them on cartel sites. <br><br>http://doremi-fansubs.com/</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And they said fansubbing was dead. <br><br>A RIP from a DVD or bluray is not a fansub. Most of what you have listed are rippers. They never did any real subbing. <br><br>RIPs are not fansubs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'd rather get paid to fansub within guidelines than do it for free the way I want for a shit fanbase. <br><br>It's good to have production values and official sourcing. So in those respects, both Crunchyroll and FUNimation put out fairly good products of good consistency. In terms of fansub quality as compared to the heyday of fansubbing of the 1990's, the quality is far superior in terms of video and audio quality. With digital piracy, almost everyone is watching what would be termed in 1990's fansubbing as the "master fansub tape" as there is no generational loss from copies.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't understand. Is the chart supposed to suggest that it's not?</br></br>  <br>k</br>  <br>Fuck off. We don't need your Doremi shill here.</br>   no loli spammer <br>/a/ is dead</br>  <br><br><br>Somebody post the gifs (or webms if any were made) pls.</br></br></br>  <br> pan subs away to make room for useless advertisement scrolling text <br>The only good thing they ever did.</br></br>  <br><br>Thank you anon, you have made me happy.</br></br>  <br>I actually only saw your post after I posted, so I felt a little proud of myself too.

Their rips are on time and are very watchable.<br><br>Commie just edits the CR script and adds memes then draws dicks in the subs and releases about 5-10 minutes before HS.<br><br>Others are too slow to be relevant.

Please remember to shitpost going forward.</br></br>  <br>Horrible subs acknowledged they didn't fansub and just straight up ripped before, now in their faq they say they don't rip and sub which clearly isn't true. Anyone know why they changed it?</br>  <br>Cartel rules to remain on NT. Daiz just struck it out on the HS page to conform, but everyone knows they just rip and maybe edit spelling/grammatical errors.</br>  <br>They clearly don't.

I mean, is Giorno actually constantly cracking jokes in dialogue or something and us english-speakers are left out of the loop? Is he constantly cussing everyone out and rude and everyone hates him but keeps him around for some reason? <br><br>I just struggle to picture a situation in which just changing the text changes Giorno's character as much as you guys keep insisting. <br><br>And don't get me wrong, I like Giorno! I just feel like there's some overselling going on, is all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i love this shit</br>  <br>Doc has a whole album, the ones that are being posted here are probably coming from there hence the filenames.</br>  <br>Doc has a gallery of it<br>http://imgur.com/a/b2Ntd</br></br>  <br>I'm the one that posted those two, and yes they are from Doc's album</br>    Let us all praise Josuke's wonderful hair  <br>From what i understand, part of the style of part five is that all the characters had unique text fonts and styles in their speech bubbles which denoted their accents and attitudes.<br>It was the only part written like this and provided extremely subtle characterization.<br><br>From what I am told Giorno's personality is pretty much good guy DIO. He is authoritative and commanding, while also being quiet and slow to speak. Basically he is supposed to sound suave as hell. <br>This was totally lost in translation, and he comes off as flat just like everyone else. <br><br>Frankly he still sounds boring as hell to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>TV-nihon, plz</br>  <br>  not didney worl in gif <br>one job, anon</br></br>  I just tealized Dio's Road Roller fail makes no sense.<br><br>No matter how you look at it, Jotaro seemingly teleported out of there, without Dio noticing. Even if Dio couldn't move he would still percieve stopped time, so it's ridiculous that jotaro could squeeze out from under that thing without Dio noticing.</br></br>  <br>because magical punch ghosts that can stop time in the first place makes sense either way, right?</br>  how  <br><br>The more you think about this stuff, the less sense it's going to make.</br></br>  <br>doesn't matter how weird the basic laws are. How time stops work and how percieving it works is clearly defined.<br><br>Then again they shouldn't have been flying like DBZ either so i guess Araki just said fuck it.<br><br><br>this one's actually possible by previously established things about Crazy Diamond, except for one main disregard of the rule.<br><br>The smaller part pulled in the bigger part, its mentioned to be the other way around.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Josuke's hair <br> wonderful <br>pick one</br></br></br>  I thought speedwagon died in the 50s, not in part 2's year<br>mistranslation I guess<br><br>I was going along the lines that okuyasu was fucking dead/disintegrated but i guess RHCP was just dragging his body away</br></br></br>  Stand Name: Salty Dog<br><br>Stand Ability: [Skin Manipulation](http://powerlisting.w<wbr>ikia.com/wiki/Skin_Manipulation)<br><br>Power - C<br><br>Speed - D<br><br>Range - B<br><br>Durability - A<br><br>Precision - B<br><br>Potential - B<br><br>Description: Power to control skin of oneself or others.

What meme is he involved in?</br>  <br><br><br>Well Dio had to spend a couple of years only acting during the night and he didn't complain about it.<br><br>Kars is a baby.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I can't believe I'm arguing about this, but Dio had already experienced the sunlight and had a power boner. Kars already had a lot of power and was gaining even more, in an attempt to quell his sun-seeking boner.</br>  <br> implying he won't be named Jesus Joestar </br>  <br> Shit  hair.</br>  There's no such thing as a bad stand. Prove me wr-<br>oh....you can't? Oh well.</br>  <br>Your stand 『Shit post』is pretty bad</br>  <br>Define bad.</br>  <br>Kira tho</br>  <br>notorious big was pretty bad</br>  <br>Kira is the only tragic villain. He wasn't bothering anybody. He wasn't doing anything THAT bad. He was just killing some random nobodies every couple of weeks or so. He paid his taxes, and was an honest man who wanted a peaceful life.</br>  <br>Murdering is wrong Anon.</br>  <br> He wasn't doing anything THAT bad. <br> He was just killing <br> every couple of weeks or so. <br>Face it, that is pretty bad. Kira is still best villain though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kira never murdered anyone. All he did was give them justice.</br>  <br>All Funny Valentine wanted to do was improve his country.</br>  <br>why didn't he just get a version of johnny &amp; gyro that were loyal to him</br>  <br>Better yet, why didn't he try to obtain the corpse parts by any other method than the one he used. Seriously, organizing a race through all the locations of the corpse parts was stupid.</br>  <br>It was an excuse by Araki since had to do give the race some purpose instead of focusing away from it to something unrelated to it.<br><br><br>If he could find one that can defeat them, sure. But there's also a risk of menger sponge obliteration and loss of a corpse part if Johnny still had his.</br></br></br></br>  <br> guys shitting on other JoJo villains to make Pucci look good and ignoring his flaws. <br>Literally no Pucci-follower does this. The only other Villian they bring up is DIO and that's just to talk about fucking him. People are allowed to appreciate the aspect of their favorite villian they like most.</br></br>  <br> All he did was give them justice. <br>Good man, whores all need to be damned. Kira is a kindred spirit,</br></br>  holy shit did i miss Giorno coming back?  <br>Is Kira a frogposter?</br>  just finished  watching  part 3 is going on worth it?  Part 4 anime never  <br> No </br>  All he wanted was a quiet life  <br> Kira a shit. He killed Best boy Fatty! </br>  <br>Of course.<br>Stands in Part 4 and every part after is way more creative than Part 3 Stands. Part 3 is one of, if not, the shittest part. If you enjoyed it then you are bound to enjoy the following parts.</br></br>  Reminder that Wonderfest is on Sunday and among some already announced figs being revealed there's going to be a few exclusives sold there: <br><br> SAS DIO Swarovski edition  <br> SAS Kakyoin Swarovski edition  <br> SAS Jolyne  <br> SL Jonathan <br> SL Zeppeli Red Ver </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was arguing with this one follower about who the best villain is. Normally, I would say Valentine but I decided to say Dio because he's that fucking cool and this guy had the gall to shit on him and say that he's a pawn for Pucci being the best villain even though without him, Pucci wouldn't have done all those things.</br>  <br>What is this? A Josuke for ants?</br>              <br>Someone took docs edit a step further, too bad it's 1/5th of it's original size now.</br>  Autism inbound<br> I thought a cool idea for a stand would be where the user cracks his knuckles or anything else and that causes small explosions which can be stored for short amounts of time before being released, or instantaneous. I thought of a scenario where a big bad literally crushes said character without learning of the stand properly and then a huge explosion occurs due to the cracking of all of the user's bones </br>  <br> Watch the part 3 anime  <br> Jotaro is completely stoic <br> throws out a one liner here and there and only smiles once or twice <br> boring as fuck <br> gets even worse in the other parts <br><br> Read the Part 3 manga <br> Jotaro is stoic but makes a lot of expressions <br> cracks jokes and smiles a lot <br> run of the mill protag with some charm <br><br>Why did the anime and part 4-6 manga kill Jotaro's character</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I swear to god I will kill Araki if we get anything similar to this.</br>  <br>Ayy</br>  <br>That is pretty autistic<br>Sounds like an interesting Killer Queen-esque stand, sorta like how Ringo had a time ability that was used differently.</br></br>  <br>I try my best to utilize the autism</br>  <br>Count the prime numbers.</br>  <br>i don't think the anime changed any dialogue like you're implying<br>but i do wish they hadn't got rid of his and star platinum's smiles</br></br>  Post best covers  So can we expect a PROPER Duwang sub when part 4 comes out?<br><br>Also part 4 ED predictions</br></br>    <br>Is it that time where we share our autistic thoughts?<br><br>I think The World is the most menacing stand in the series. A bunch of other stands either look goofy but act strong, or look strong but say a lot of retarded shit. The World doesn't have any personality, doesn't say anything, and barely changes his expression. The other villains have good stand designs, but I still think The World is the most effective one. Araki got that design down to a T.<br><br>  The fact that they imply if it weren't for Dio's personality that it would go out of control makes it even more dangerous  </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Stand Name: Thrift Shop<br><br>Stand Ability: [Garbage Manipulation](http://powerlisting.w<wbr>ikia.com/wiki/Garbage_Manipulation)<wbr><br><br>Power - C<br>Speed - B<br>Range - B<br>Durability - C<br>Precision - B<br>Potential - B<br><br>Description: The power to manipulate various kinds of garbage.

Is there a difference to Anubis in the manga?</br>  <br>i hear that all the time, but where is that implied?</br>  So when a Stand is doing the rapid punching and shit, who is doing the rapid onomatopoeia yelling: the Stand or the Stand-user?  <br>It isn't.</br>  <br>In the manga his creator is a vampire and you get to see him later. It's real easy to miss since he only briefly shows up, and he's looking for Anubis. I hope Araki uses him later on.</br>  <br>According to ASB it's the stand with the exception of Narancia.</br>  <br><br>The stand will always take over the user´s voice, driven through willpower.</br></br>  <br><br>Part 6 when they're talking about the things Dio wrote down in his notebook.</br></br>  <br>talking about my version?</br>  <br>Stands ARE the users. I'd assume that unless the stand otherwise speaks on its own, then it's the user.</br>  <br>the version where The World was supposed to be less saturated.</br>  <br>Mind posting where it says that?</br>  Does this offend you?  <br>yeah thats me<br>that was my final version for the moment but i was thinking about messing around with it more</br></br>  <br>Yes just because Iggy is with Joseph and not Avdol or Polnareff.</br>  <br>Sure. Remind me which chapters they did flashbacks to Dio and I'll go skim em.</br>  Just finished the anime, now I'm depressed. Is the manga worth reading, does it get better than Jotaro's adventure?  <br>Try lurking for more than 5 minutes</br>  <br>While not "bad," getting stuck with Cheap Trick would suck.</br>  <br>literally yes almost no one here is an animeonly fag</br>  <br> is it worth reading <br>It only gets more bizarre.</br></br>  <br>Didn't wanna be spoiled in case it stays gud.<br><br><br>Thanks anon, I'll give it a read and get out of this thread before angry other anon spoils something.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope. Part 3 was the highlight. Parts 4-8 only go downhill. <br><br>Hopefully the animated adaptions will be better, just wait for them. Adaptions are almost always superior to the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>Well pucci kills jotaro so I'd say yes.</br>  <br>i hope someone knows because i'm very curious about this</br>  <br>It's cool, we don't spoil anything when we know people are currently reading. Polnareff becomes a turtle in part 5. Pucci wins and the universe is reset in part 6. Gyro dies in part 7.</br>  <br> *tips* </br>  Finally finished SBR. Araki really ramped up the amount of little drawings in the speech bubbles towards the end.  <br> Gyro dies in part 7 <br>A Zeppeli dying? No one would have expected that.</br></br>  <br>If you live in 'Murica, through tomorrow Barnes and Noble is running a buy 2 get 3rd free deal on all their manga. Use this chance to get the first three volumes of Jojo</br>  <br>I wasn't even being sarcastic, I've been looking for which chapters Dio are in but all I know is the one in Time for Heaven, and that's not it.</br>  whats the best site to read part 4, batoto seems like hassle  <br>A hassle? You literally click the chapter and read. Too hard for you?</br>  Why didn't Kira just not scream his name?  <br>too much spanish shit in the way</br>  <br> buying manga </br>  <br>Because that would have been loud. He wanted a quiet life.</br>  <br>Fuck off, you're too retarded even for the shitshow that jojo threads are.</br>  <br>Did you miss the "not" part?</br>  <br>Do we really have to spoonfeed you?

Then Araki probably had to find a way for Kira to lose.</br>  Bite the Dust affects you only if you see Killer Queen right? <br><br>What if you close your eyes and you find out about its ability, would you be safe?</br></br>  <br>Welp, looked through all these, couldn't find it. Went back and skimmed some of Dio's World as well and didn't find any mention in there. <br><br>It was probably an implied throwaway line that didn't really mean anything that people took another meaning to. Oh well.</br></br></br>  <br>What the hell are you talking about? He's a Stand that dates back to ancient Egyptian times. His user died a long time ago.</br>  <br> He is already in your eye. <br>There really is no way of countering Bites the Dust because you wouldn't expect it. You don't exactly go to people with your eyes closed asking about a murderer.</br></br>  <br>when rohan gets affected an image of Killer Queen is continually projected into your vision closer and close until it takes over your line of sight and goes into your eye.<br>even if you close your eyes, you will see Killer Queen, and you will die.</br></br>  <br>*like when Rohan</br>  <br><br>I always thought Kira had managed to turn the knowledge of Kawajira's true identity into a bomb, so even if you close your eyes your head will still explode</br></br>  <br>Josuke looks so uncomfortable.</br>  <br>Will the art ever get as good as part 4 again?</br>  Hey guys, remember that time Kakyoin died?  <br>Who?</br>  GOOD!  <br>yes.<br>part 5 has shit scans but it probably looks good<br>6, 7, and 8 all look fantastic</br></br></br>  <br>Nobody important, he was just some faggot painter guy</br>  <br>I don't like 8. Something happened between it and 7. It seems lazier. Shouldn't really complain as it's still good, but it's been better.</br>  Why did people get shorter in part 4?  <br>Why did they make ASB C-Moon's torso so normal-looking when the odd proportions were clearly intentional?<br><br><br>Well, it's the only part with magazine scans instead of tank ones and the scan quality itself is really inconsistent to boot.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Shhh, don't worry about it.</br></br>  <br>well he seems a bit thicker in this one</br>  ITT: pic releated (from Hungary)  Sao<br>SnK<br>Elfen lied <br>mirai nikki</br></br></br>  Anything Ghibli.

All I ever see is people complaining about it.</br>  <br><br>I see the STD/DX version, release date and scale, but not a price.</br></br>  <br>People with shit taste.</br>  <br>More idols than my wallet would like probably</br>  <br>Extra torso also most probably limited+exclusive, do you want to guess the price?</br>  <br>It was shit.</br>   otakumode still hasn't restocked the mushishi art book <br>Fucking cunts.</br>  Today is a good day.  So do you guys think this is all we'll be getting to see monmusu related besides maybe the Miia daki?<br>I hope we see a scale or something</br>  <br>STD is the worst abbreviation they could've used.</br>  <br>I am sure there will at least be announcements at wonfes.</br>  <br>that's why you should buy the DX one.</br>  <br>She looks terrible in that picture. Mostly because of the paint.</br>  <br><br>She's probably going to be as much as the Sorceress, meaning I'll pass. At this point I actually like that they are going full retarded jew on that line up, its saving me lots of money.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128506857 <br>Fucking ew.</br>  <br>Spider scale figure would be magnificent.</br>  <br><br>I can't see Miia, Rachnee, or Cerea getting anything more than 1/8ths, probably with really condensed poses like Miia fairly coiled up or Cerea sitting or something.</br></br>  wasn't expecting this to come out so soon  <br>The lighting is really odd. Hopefully we get better photograph soon.</br>  <br>I've always had fantasies of this being a good Miia scale<br>her tail could be the base</br></br>  <br><br>That works. And the one with Cerea has her in a sitting pose as well.</br></br>  <br>Hunter a best.</br>  <br>We saw the sculpt around four months ago. Seems like a fairly standard time schedule to me. Are you going to order through gsc for the wall scroll?</br>  <br>Couldn’t agree more, at this point I'm not sure I'm getting even Mage.</br>  <br>what a crappy WS</br>  <br>I suppose that's true, but at that time it was still unpainted as well. I probably won't order from GSC's site, would rather jew off $15</br>  <br>Figure name?</br>  <br>it's in the picture.</br>  <br>I wonder who is more disappointed in you. Me, or your parents.</br>  <br>Hunter from Bikini Warriors</br>  <br>Pre-ordered. Maybe I'll watch the show eventually but either way that expression does it for me.</br>  <br>Haven't seen the show nor have I ever buyfagged but god damn that is cute. I want it.</br>  <br>Get her.</br>  <br> it <br>get lost, normie</br></br>  <br>Superior version.</br>  <br><br>Pretty much the same here, the expression and the surprisingly cheap price is making me want it. Will wait till after Wonfest to order her though.</br></br>  <br>My bad. I guess it just happened since I haven't seen the show.</br>    <br>Remember everyone, these kind of people vote, breed, and breathe the same air that we do.</br>  <br><br><br><br>It honestly isn't. At all.</br></br></br></br>  How come no one says "Madokashit"? Is Madoka universally accepted here?  <br>I haven't seen much Madokashit being posted recently.</br>  <br>It's at least better than fate/boats/sins/most other shitty mainstream shows</br>  <br>I can't even remember what the last Madoka fig was.<br><br>Psycho yukata Madoka?</br></br></br>  <br>Maiko Mami came out last month. Sayaka and Kyouko are due out in November.<br><br>There have also been 3 Akuma Homuras in the last 6 months.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know how to describe Madoka fans more than pleb, shit taste, meme, etc. Mostly just stupid. Boring. Uninteresting.<br><br>Like bugs being drawn to a light source at night. Endlessly bumping into it like a moron.</br></br></br>   http://myfigurecollection.net/item<wbr>/330951</wbr> <br><br>So it's finally happening.</br></br>  <br>Cool, I just started playing Muramasa the other day.</br>  http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>330952<br><br>Alter is making more idols too. Eri swimsuit version.</br></br></wbr>  <br>Call me when they rerelease momohime</br>  <br><br>You're two years late.</br></br>  <br>I hope they re-re-release her</br>  banpresto  <br><br>Good luck, there's a better chance to see pigs flying than Alter releasing something a third time.</br></br>  Wing has some teaser images.  <br>Why are Sonico's prize figures so much more interesting than most of her scales?</br>    <br>Kisuke when? He is a faggot and I don't even like him but I need to complete my collection.</br>      <br><br>Mother of god<br><br>I can't believe it's happening, going to preorder on amiami as soon as she's available.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And so begins the WonFes hype</br>  <br>"Do I fit in yet guys, please let me know if I fit in"</br>  <br>Another Ignis scale?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  I really want this wall scroll.  <br>would murder for rachnee in her hammock.</br>  <br>post a better angle</br>  <br>Does she even have a tail?</br>  <br>Because they only ever put her in fucking swimsuits for her scales</br>  <br>I hope they make this pose and not the same pose GK has. This is a lot cuter.</br>  <br>Not likely</br>  <br>Depends on HLJ's discount. Not really a fan of GSC's random charging either.</br>  I want the full art for that swimsuit Satan.  <br>Swimsuit is guaranteed seller. Anything else could bomb.</br>  <br><br>God, I'm so fucking sick of swimsuit figures.</br></br>  Skytube.    <br>Stirrups are hot.</br>    <br>I want the full art of everything, especially of fluffy Belphegor.</br>  <br>I watched the show, hated it, but still pre-ordered her. The show might be shit, but I liked her. She's miles better than the other girl.</br>  <br>she looks really cute in that picture. I should reconsider picking up her scale.</br>  <br>What's with all the pokemon merch lately</br>  <br>fuck.</br>  <br>20th anniv</br>  <br>It's not that great a game. The character designs are the best part.</br>  <br>It's a shit overhyped game, the figs are fine though</br>  <br><br>I dunno, I like it.</br></br>  Anyone else going to wonfes on sunday?<br>Any veterans have advice?<br>I'm salty i can't make it to comicon but this seems like the next best thing.</br></br>  <br>Have fun. Keep hydrated.</br>  <br>Unless you're a GK buyer, Wonfest is more of a one and done type of thing. Since everything else good is already sold out by the time you get to the front of the line.<br> <br>Figure out which line you're going to wait in before Saturday night.</br></br></br>  <br>Well fuck, I'll buy 3 of that.</br>  Ultra pleb here. Since AmiAmi specifies yen only, if I use an American debut card will the currency automatically translate and the transaction go through with no problems?  <br>A newfag to this whole buyfag business.<br>How much is the price difference for shit in Japan and otherwise? I know it must differ depending on many factors, but the question is how often and how much? Just thought that I can buy shit here for lower prices and send it to anons, so I came here with questions.<br><br>I know that I don't make any sense, I'm sleepy, so yes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Have faith in Crabman it's all we can do for now.</br>  shit.  <br> No visible pubic hair <br><br>Not interested</br></br></br>  <br>didn't you notice her tiny head?</br>  <br>I noticed that there's no pubes. <br>That's all that matters on a fig.</br></br>  <br>Which one is this? she's beautiful</br>  <br>headswap?</br>   that Jessie <br><br>Instabuy.</br></br>  <br>How can a figure have a flabby ass, but no ass at the same time?<br><br>It defies logic.</br></br></br>  <br>Usually yes.<br><br>You should also be aware of what % your card charges on foreign currency exchanges. Some banks might find a foreign transaction to be suspicious and block it. In that case you will have to get in contact with them. If for some reason it doesn't work out you can set up a pay pal account.<br><br>What are you thinking of getting?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this<br>How long do you think it will be before pre-orders run out?</br></br>  <br>Not same guy, but probably fairly fast</br>  <br>http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>235633<br><br>That isn't an easy question to answer.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Gonna watch the show just to see if I want her or not</br>  Take it easy!  <br>This is what nightmares are made of.</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  The ruv is real.  <br>You and I both, anon.</br>  <br>I give up, what would be easier to get into, Idolmaster or Love Live?<br><br>Need to finally watch an idol animu</br></br></br>  Native teasers.<br><br>I am okay with this becoming a meme.</br></br>  http://native.blog.jp/archives/3721<wbr>4641.html</wbr>  Adult boobs hot blue leaves, the illustrations will be on display booth is.

I wonder whether ther will be any proper scales or super deformed announced at wonfes.<br><br><br>I am pretty sure when he said sorceress he was referring to Dark Elf, not mage.</br></br></br>  <br>Those 30 seconds she had sure were great.</br>  <br>Which 30 seconds?<br>She appeared more than that</br></br>  I want to  live off of  Anzu's  royalties.       <br>details? <br>As far as i know this is the only kongou from arpeggio.</br></br>  <br>FAKE NEET<br>FAKE LOLI<br>FAKE IDOL</br></br></br>  <br>Really cute, though.</br>  <br><br>Looks weird TBH</br></br>  <br>Just like all idols and celebrities.</br>  <br>Did they really post this with such tiny text?</br>  <br> No pubes </br>  Hey, anons.

I'm thinking of getting into im@s, will I have to buy an xbox and play through the games before watching the anime?  I'm half expecting responses to be la guia </br>  What are the chances of seeing/hearing anything about pic related (or I guess any of the Hibikes)?

Take especially care of the Kotomi figure I stopped caring about, she's in dire need of a peg repair.</br>  <br>They are both trash.

Sick of that shit.</br>  <br>I like all of the weird little handmade tchotchkes that they sell there.</br>  Broccoli teasers. Today is really busy.  <br><br>360 release is the main original game, introducing Miki (arcade version actually starred Haruka).<br><br>It has fleshed out full routes of all idols but starts you off with only one idol. You have to work your way through multiple playthroughs in order to create duos and trios, as well as collecting accessories (presents from fan letters) which "randomly" appear after every evening.<br><br>L4U is a fandisc (basically Taiko) which skips out the grind of getting 3 idols + favorite song + all accessories in the original game. Also has a ton of DLC, but unlike the original game, the DLC in L4U has no attributes/influence on the game itself. It's purely cosmetic.<br><br>2 is set +1 year in a different timeline; anime is an adaptation of it. Forces you into choosing 3 idols. Also, the president's voice actor is new, because the original game's president's voice actor died (irl), as well as Yukiho, who has a new seiyuu. 2 has fleshed out routes and has a linear path, expects multiple playthroughs much like the first. Generally not as liked as much as the first.<br><br>2 introduces Takane and Hibiki, which are also in the PSP releases, which are basically just rhythm games. Also, the PSP Shiny Festa games were released in iOS, in English I believe. I didn't bother so no idea if it's any good.<br><br>OFA is more of a streamlined, easier version of the former games.but expects the player to have played the former releases beforehand. Has a levelling system.<br><br>There's also an iM@S in the works for PS4.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br><br><br><br>Seems as though people  donut  want this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>getting tired of this cunt</br>  <br>I just want a fucking Ononoki</br>    <br> boring fujotoy gets scale <br>Good Kekkai Sensen figures never.</br></br>  I think I grew another dick.    <br>Maybe Alter will do others too if Leo sells well.</br>  has anyone made WF bingo cards yet? those always amused me.  <br>Oh shit thanks anon!

You would need to import a Japanese 360 if you want to play them (1 + L4U). However, I think it's worth it because 1) the prices of Japanese 360 units has dropped significantly, someone on eBay was selling them for $60 a little while ago and 2) there's a pretty nice array of exclusives out there.<br><br>2 is also on 360, so you wouldn't need a PS3 for it, unless you really wanted to play OFA or G4U (the gravure photoshoot games bundled with the anime blurays). Also, I realize this is really minor, but since I own 2 for both 360 and PS3, I can say that the 360 version is slightly visually superior (and the green/blue/red notes correspond with the controller, unlike PS3). <br><br>If you decide to look into PS3, all the G4U volumes are on JP PSN digitally for cheap along with 2 and OFA itself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mr.Color <br>Are figure like nendos hand painted? <br>I sincerely have no idea how figures are painted.</br></br></br>  <br>Can't wait to place her in yandere row next to Reimu and Madoka.</br>  time to get scolded<br>http://hobby.dengeki.com/news/84718<wbr>/</wbr></br>  <br> headless guitar <br>Disgusting.

So instead of trying to join Islam, they'll befriend the 2D world.</br>  <br> Shitposting to save the world <br>And you people thought we were crazy</br></br>  <br><br><br>ITS A FUCKING CANTALOUPE.</br></br></br>  <br>Some dipshit had the idea that they could produce so much content, and that the content would become so popular, that when googling ISIS all you'll get is a steaming pile of moeblob. And they somehow hope to do this without making porn.<br><br>It's all retarded, basically.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean you're still crazy<br><br>But it's cool so everything is okay</br></br></br>    <br> Without making porn <br><br>For what purpose?</br></br></br>  <br>Stay in your containment board, /pol/lack.</br>    <br>WHORE</br>  <br> google ISIS <br> get porn instead <br>GENIUS</br></br></br>  <br> rape rape rape <br>There is more to travesty than rape. So much more. Sort your shit out.</br></br>  <br>So, instead of kids learning about religion and world politics and maybe getting off their asses to do something with their life, they're being brainwashed into asexual NEETs. This just sounds like another form of terrorism.</br>  <br>Ugh.</br>  So ISIS is getting memed on basically? Can't handle the bantz?  <br>They're late, it's already old.</br>    <br>How the fuck are you going to learn religion from googling ISIS other than Islam a shit?</br>  <br>That's not the purposes of making ISIS-chan retard, japs just want to forget their people's death with making ISIS-chan as a joke.<br>Fucking western</br></br>    <br>They have ground rules. No gore. No porn. No mention of Islam or showing off any symbols associated with Islam. Just moe.<br><br><br>That's exactly what you're not getting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The rest of the world still can't keep up with out banter and superior sense of humour. <br> Hopefully we'll keep all that with boats confirmed fucked regardless of political party. All they need to do now is clam down on immigration, stop selling shit to China, stop double dipping in the mines and finally reinvest in production, and we'd be set.  </br></br>  Anime bringing terrorists and people together to stop war.  <br>Jesus. This is fucking driving me insane.</br>  <br>It should, tripshit.</br>  <br>I want muslims to go and stay go.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Hajibs will never not be ugly<br><br>Hiding the hair and neckline? Fucking faggot mudslimes</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Back to /pol/, racist sack of shit.</br>  <br>She should have gone with a cute ninja mask instead.</br>  <br/>  <br> offended sandniggers </br>  <br>Fuck off, mudslime.</br>  <br> Islam <br> Race <br><br>Pick one.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Everton are shite faggot</br>  <br>But 4chan is pol you bacon eater you.</br>  <br>And the cantaloupe is a race of melon so shut the fuck up.</br>  <br>Not to /pol/. Remember, sullying the gene pool is the worst crime for them</br>  <br>?</br>  <br>Go back to r9k you frogposting twat.</br>  <br>You buttmad? Here have another one. <br>This thread shouldn't be allowed anyway.</br></br>  <br> Melon </br>  Oh.<br>So NTR out of the way, things will be getting confrontational soon.<br>I predict next 5-10 chapters will see a revealing of either Tomo or Jun's feelings.</br></br>  <br> YFW Carol has more common sense than both Jun and Tomo combined </br>  <br>I hope Carol doesn't get tossed aside if this continues for a decent amount of time, she's both funny, cute, and could help fill the role Misuzu is playing right now.</br>  How can you make a female character that is a bitch, but also both cute and pure at the same time? I didn't realize it was possible.  <br>She's not really a bitch.</br>  <br>She clearly realized that the role was reversed. She has her husband, she gets mad that girl hangs around her husband, she wants a way to remove her from husband's side. And it just ended up being flipped around.</br>  <br>Tomo already confessed to him back on page 1! Jun is the only one who needs to figure shit out.</br>  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br>There was never any NTR. There was a girl hanging out with a guy to get information on her crush, and a clueless guy helping a girl out with training.<br><br>Also, use the fucking catalog, there are two other threads up already, and we're having daily threads to begin with.</br></br></br>  <br> Jun is the only one who needs to figure shit out <br>How to have her grow a penis?</br></br>  <br>It hurts</br>  <br>It's fun.</br>  As a personal NTR-guy, I gotta say Tomo x Jun is too perfect to spoil. Thank you based Mangaka.  <br>What does common sense have to do with it if they've both been up in their faces like that ever since they were children with no romantic feeling involved?</br>  <br> Tomo x Jun is too perfect to spoil <br>Jun x Misuzu disagrees.</br></br>  <br>She's in no way funny. Bouncing breasts and randomly standing inside people's closets isn't funny.</br>  <br> standing inside people's closets isn't funny </br>  <br>Reminder that Anno killed Penpen in 3.0</br>  This manga looks like it has great girls and is fun. Is there actually any NTR?<br><br>Gonna pick this up</br></br>  <br>Why would he do that?</br>  <br>Because otaku are disgusting and we can't have nice things.</br>  So now that the dust has settled can we all agree that Kyouko won the Sayakab owl?  <br>I'm not the one regretting my place in life.</br>    <br>Good night.</br>  <br>Regrets are fine so long as when you die you have no regrets! Die with a purpose! Don't die without a purpose!<br><br><br>It's a good song about a woman who can't handle being an adult.<br><br> ah, I really hate this; as I grow older, the fun things I can do decrease, this world is like a never ending penalty game. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't even know what to say.</br></br>  Who's got the better design out of the whole cast?  <br>Is Kaori relevant at all in the novels or did Kyoani greatly expand her role? Does she matter in the third, Asuka-centric novel?</br>  Nibble it you fool.  Let's settle this, fagotts.<br><br>http://pollit.me/44</br></br>  <br>It's going to be the fagotts.  Kyoani pls. </br>  It was a toss up between the perverted senpai and Kousaka, and then Kousaka showed up in that white summer dress and totally blew me away.  When will the latest chapter get translated guys? And for how long do you think the manga will go on before it goes on a fucking hiatus again?  <br>He probably means the Vortex of Souls, but alas yes, those who are caught in the affairs of the Godhand and apostles do indeed go there, as shown by Vargas.<br><br>That was said by Slan during the first major Godhand appearance if I recall correctly. 'Caught in the affairs of the Godhand and apostles' probably means souls too traumatized and consumed by negative emotions (like the hatred, and negativity that led Vargas to live a life driven by vengeance).</br></br></br>  Why are griffithfags so desperate for people to like an awful person?  <br>There you go. That said, despite what I just said in , I'd agree that those souls shown in  will probably end up there too.<br><br><br>Yup, Griffith confirms it.</br></br></br></br>  when will the chapters get online?<br><br>I NEED THEM</br></br>  <br>Is that muira?</br></blockquote>]
