[ Here we go guys. Are you ready?  Best nee-san today?  Link for stream?  <br>It's truly a shame how irrelevant best girl is aside from cheering her bro on at his games.</br>  <br>I don't think so, sorry, I know it's a shame but don't worry she will come back later. Today will be  Hinata wearing the crown and the 190 cm wall VS 175 cm wall. Also, the now famous "I'm always this kind" and "LEV I TOLD YOU TO STOP THAT BANZAI BLOCK". <br><br><br> It's on Meizhi as usual, the first link on google. </br></br></br></br>  <br>It's gonna be a good episode.</br>  <br>thanks f/a/m</br>  Preview 1/3  <br>2/3</br>  <br>3/3</br>  <br><br><br>Thanks anon.

A best boy god.</br>  I'm rewatching the OVA while waiting for subs, it's really fun.  <br>Yaku, Lev, are you okay</br>  <br>I wonder when will the other OVA be out.</br>    <br>Slav genes are showing.</br>  Reminder that Akaashi is also an owl.  Which one of the coaches did Saeko fug back when they all got drunk together?  <br>Bokuto must be Hinata's long lost brother.</br>  <br>Hinata calling Bokuto "aniki" would be funny.</br>  <br> That file name <br><br>Why Anon? Is he an unwed teenage mother or an owl? Is it even possible to be both?</br></br></br>  <br> is it possible <br>This is anime.</br></br>  <br>Good point</br>    <br>Still a giant fry</br>  I can tell Taketora, Shibayama, Inuoka, but who is the guy on the right?  ~10 mins until subs  <br>Far Right-kun.</br>  [HorribleSubs] Haikyuu!!

Using DMA or DBM would be so much easier.</br></br></br>  How much longer must this show endure Synchro hell? Will we ever get back too the more important plot that doesn't involve a tournament?  <br>I think we still have like 5 duels left, assuming they're all one parters and that we have 1 filler episode between duels it's at least 10 more episodes but I'm just going to say another 24 episodes at most. Who knows, maybe the tournament won't even end properly and shit will go down.</br>  <br> One parters <br>ha<br>ALL of them will be 2parters<br>If REEEEE vs Yuya and Shillbowl were both 2-parters, why wouldn't important duels be 2-parters?</br></br></br></br>  So is Crow pretty much confirmed to lose to Yuya since Yugo and Yuya need to throwdown?

No hate pls.  <br>That's the general consensus soo</br>  Despite all the cuteness and funny moments in the beginning, Chuugakou has been going down hill. Is there any hope for a season 2 guys? Everything is starting to seem so rushed and rando, an entire episode of RB walking up stairs to see that forced canon moment.  Best girl development WHEN?  <br>The last episode was better than most in the beginning.</br>  <br>I liked the beginning episodes more to be honest</br>  Finally we will see Berty in action It was the hardest week of my life.  <br>50% of that episode was looped scenes with subs. How was it better than anything they've put out so far?</br>  <br>Last episode gave me impression there won't be a second season.</br>  <br> those creepily drawn big heads <br> Frieda <br>It was one of the few episodes whose scenes weren't a copy pasta of moments in the anime.</br></br></br>  i hate shitmir  <br>Didn't I tell you to keep this shit in last thread?</br>  <br> Berty in action <br><br>Being a sperg around Annie?</br></br></br>  Good morning /snk/, we shit posting today?  Around which hour do they release the new episode?  <br>Why was she getting naked in that ED?</br>  <br>Her husbando was nearby</br>  Is this picture accurate?  <br>Around five hours from now</br>  <br>Fuck off and stop making threads.</br>  <br>Stay mad bud</br>  <br>Shartmin is not that tall</br>  cancer  <br>this</br>  How long until Shitwong is dead? I'm tired of the buildup of death flags for him not to die. He should've been dead last chapter but for whatever reason Pigner went full autismo and didn't kill him. When will Isayama stop teasing the majority and give them what they want?    <br>They had to summarize years worth of manga and story into this short of an amount of episodes. What do you want them to do? Stop fishing for replies.</br>  <br>I wonder who is behind this post</br>  Do you guys take your coffee with the new Chuugakkou or after?  So, guys, Isayama writes the script for Spoof, or is he just the original author of Shingeki?  <br>Just the original author.</br>  <br> ... <br> Mikasa <br><br>VERY CUTE</br></br></br></br>  <br> that mikasa panel <br><br>Not out of place even when the author tries to make it seem like she is.</br></br></br>  <br>I see, thanks,<br>Also, I miss the cute retardation on Spoof.</br></br>  <br>But Hounori Mikasa is best Mikasa</br>  <br>That would be canon Mikasa.</br>  <br> I am NOT hype for the Bertisode <br>Then why did you even create a thread?</br></br>  A few more hours.  <br>That wasn't even me friend</br>  <br>Not op, but I am 100% not hype for the bertisode.</br>  <br>Then we get to see your land whale self samefag 200 posts about your shitty Bort. Kill yourself</br>  <br>Oh the irony.</br>  <br>But she was picturing him as a shota right after getting naked</br>  <br>What irony? It's the truth retard, you did it about your spoiler. Now you'll do it about the episode. I can picture it now, your fat self watching the unsubbed version being live streamed. Furiously prntscreening giggling to yourself like an autistic fuck as you debate the 'complexity' of his character. Then proceed to post your pic before everyone else has even watched the episode and act like you had any idea what was happening. So fucking pathetic, go take a class on Japanese you pathetic NEET fuck.</br>  <br>Oh the exponential irony.</br>  <br>Elaborate retard</br>  <br>  Furiously prntscreening giggling to yourself like an autistic fuck as you debate the 'complexity' of his character. <br><br>kek</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> 2015  <br> Misuse of the word irony </br></br></br></br>  <br> that wasn't me <br>Yeah, right.</br></br>  <br>Not him, but it's only you who do that.</br>  <br> not him <br>Is that landwhale butthurt I hear?</br></br>  <br> a shitposter and confirmed samefag calling anyone else a samefag <br> sperging like that out of the blue </br></br>  <br>Why even waste your time replying to the retard?</br>  <br>do bimbongs ever not get triggered?</br>  <br> complains about samefagging <br> goes full retard on samefagging <br>The fuck?</br></br></br>  <br>Piggy or irrelevancy? Which are you?</br>  <br>Porker please, it's only 8 am. How are you this mad already?</br>  <br> implying Reinerfag and Mikasafag aren't the same retard </br>  <br>I-it wasn't anon...</br>  <br>Not even him, but you're just shit posting now friend.</br>  From Isayama's blog<br><br>http://blog.livedoor.jp/isayamahazi<wbr>me/archives/9093964.html<br><br>Manuscript's is done.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> comparing MikaQT to Reiner <br> ever <br><br>Please just kill yourself family man.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do you reset your IP with every post? Are you that scared of getting banned?</br>  <br>Even though it's autistic rage. I laughed.</br>  <br>Resetting your router doesn't make it any less obvious who you are, fuck off already and let someone else make a half decent thread when it's actually justified.</br>  <br>This legitimately applies to 100% of you retards that support Chuugakkou. For once I side with the pig.</br>  <br><br><br>I actually was lurking retard and hopped in to call you out on your bullshit finger pointing. You do it every thread, it's getting old. Please don't post at all because you're the cancer ruining these threads. Willing to put money on you being a part of the EH cancer brigade as well.</br></br></br>  <br>Absolutely nobody except your numerous alternate personalities wants you and your cancer here. Kill yourself.</br>  <br>That applies to you as well for being here.</br>  <br>I post screenshots for every episode and I will do it again, no matter how butthurt you are about this particular episode. Keep whining about it like the pathetic fuck you are.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br><br> get on this morning to watch Chuugakkou  <br> hop in the thread to discuss <br> see the same retards doing the same shit posting <br> call them out on it <br> get categorized as a samefag <br> they think they know what cancer is <br>Ugh, these threads are shit. I'm with OP actually, I wasn't in the beginning but your faggotry and constant shitposting and finger pointing changed my mind. Fuck, it doesn't even matter how frequently we have these threads because people like you make the quality consistent.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This, blatantly forced fujo pandering.</br>  <br>deep, want to commit group suicide?</br>  What I don't get about the retarded Mikasafag is how he can't ever spell big words as one.  <br>No, but you can.</br>  <br>It's impossible to commit group suicide alone faggot.</br>  <br>You can take piggy with you.</br>  <br>Mikasa confirmed for skewering the pig</br>  <br><br>Muddy you're still here? Shouldn't you be asking yourself questions on your epic blog?</br></br>    <br>Because he is retarded.</br>  <br><br><br>Muddy I am sorry to have triggered your autism. It's just really cringe watching you play internet detective.</br></br></br>  <br>this post reeks of anger and pork</br>  Why is BA such a cute?  <br>Because it's pure and innocent.</br>  http://kyojinchu.tv/music/noname.ph<wbr>p#chara2</wbr>  <br>Was it also Bert who lifted Annie up in the sport festival episode, so she didn't drown in the confetti?</br>  <br><br><br><br>We get it retard, you like to same gag and blame Reinerfags for you shitpost which start most of the arguing. What's even funnier is im not even a Reinerfag LOL fucking kill youself and rid us of your retarded cancer.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can you just not get butt blasted about every single fucking thing?</br>  <br>I love it.</br>  Any moonfags?  Stream links?  <br><br>Does the random drawings Isayama come up monthly ever have any hint in them?</br></br>  <br> I'm OP actually* <br>Fixed that for you. Sure you came here to discuss chuugakkou, that's why the very first post which caught your attention was metafagging about Mikasafag, whom you have absolutely no relation to, right? At least try to change your wording a bit if you want to sound believable, the threads wouldn't be anywhere as bad as they are now if you didn't force them to be generals in the first place.</br></br>  <br>Yes. He posted goblin Eren and Rod's titan on his blog before the chapters they appeared in.</br>  It amazes me how mods continue to allow this.  <br>When did I ever say I have no relation to Mikasa? She's definitely one of my favorite characters. Yeah keep finger pointing though retard and being negative to anything that isn't EH. You're the most annoying and cancerous poster in these threads and it has to be some higher level of delusion that you don't realize this. Also what the fuck is metafagging? Why do you keep trying to force that stupid shit down everyone's throats. Just shut the fuck up already jesus, no one pisses me off more in these threads than your pathetic fucking self. Also willing to bet hands down  is you as well.<br><br>You are a fucking joke dude.</br></br></br>  <br><br>how about you both just fuck off?</br></br>  Do they really have access to this type of technology?  <br>Im not him but I need to know: how little of a life must you have that you continue to do this every single day? I could come here at any time and there will be a thread up by you and a high chance you're acting like a retard.<br><br>It's really sad that mods refuse to ban you, no matter how much they hate our threads.</br></br></br>  <br>The threads wouldn't be as shit if the mods actually put some effort into banning people like the Mikasafag. He changes his IP every 5 minutes though so it's not easy.</br>  <br>Yeah, it's just really pathetic. Sometimes I just ignore him but he makes discussion hard when he jumps in or starts spamming out of no where. Easily the worst shitposter I've ever seen here.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Why you gotta talk to yourself though?</br></br></br></br>  <br>This, someone post links...</br>  <br>Just how stupid could you possibly be?</br>  <br>LEAVE, if you insist I'm op and you don't like the threads then fucking leave retard. We don't want you here, go have conversations with yourself in another thread.</br>  <br>You're just fueling the fire. He has his laptop/pc/ and phone on 4chan right now and ready to shit post.</br>  <br>I'm not sharing the one I use in case it lags, but maybe this one works.  http://vaughnlive.tv/elite60 </br>  New ep when?<br>S2 when?</br>  <br><br>how is asking a question stupid though?</br></br>  <br>It is creepy because clearly don't give a fuck about Bert. Also she has a crush on Eren.</br>  I can't handle it and it's not even on yet.    <br>I don't remembert this in the manga. Looks like they changed it a little.</br>  <br>That is somewhat cute.</br>  <br>Bert legitimately looks like he has Down Syndrome here. And Reiner's pumpkin coordination is disgusting.</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>    <br>I hope MikaQT can compete with that this episode.</br>  <br>Kek.</br>    <br>No you fuck off.</br>  <br>Did he finger his own ass and wants to lick it?</br>  My heart.  <br>Bert wants him to smell his finger.</br>  <br>Why the fuck are you bringing EH up out of nowhere again? Since shipping is clearly the only thing you're capable of talking about, why don't you just go discuss it on one of the hundreds of sites more accepting of this kind of shit? No,  is not me, and you have to accept that there is in fact more than one person who can't stand what you do.</br>    <br>Did they remove Historia punching him?</br>  <br>There was a flashback to their childhood days somewhere in the second part of the chapter if I recall correctly, they might've just swapped the order.</br>  <br>Report this post and move on. It's bait.</br>  What a shipperfag.  <br>What is this supposed to be?</br>  <br>Anon just report him. I'm pretty sure some of his sperg posts can qualify for a ban.</br>  Hngg  <br>Probably Reiner's dating plan for BA.</br>  <br>My fucking heart.</br>  <br>man you're pretty delusional</br>  <br>Why does this look like Historia is going on a threesome date?</br>  <br>BA sweets.</br>  <br>MikaQT always steals the spotlight senpai</br>  <br>Nice.<br><br><br>She kind of did in one chapter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish, but after all that went down, it seems mods stopped caring about absolutely everything that has to do with these threads.</br>    <br>I want to eat them both.</br>  <br>True but I do it anyway. Sometimes they do delete his posts.</br>  <br>Reiner pls.</br>  <br>The only mod lurking here is a Mikasafag.</br>  <br>Bert successfully got the icecream on him this time and dramatic music started playing. Please don't be foreshadowing ;_;</br>  In the glory of this amazin Chuugakkou episode, I'm gonna make some italian spaghetti so I can eat it in dinner while watching it.  <br>I hope there's a lot of S2 references.</br>    <br>Wow, did I call it or what? The retard is already spamming his shitty bert pics and going full autismo samefagging them.</br>  <br>Just post stream already.</br>  <br>I meant for the manga. I assume Ibata knows pretty much what's going to happen.</br>  <br>Do they? I recall there was a thread recently where all his emoticon-filled posts stayed, but some anon who urged to report them got deleted immediately.</br>  <br>Oh stop whining, I personally don't care about Bert but he's just posting screencaps for the episode, where others may be interested.</br>  <br>Why don't you give us a working link instead of spamming your pictures and hoping for replies?</br>  <br>Sometimes it happens. You'll know it when he starts sperging about the mod.</br>  <br>Probably, especially after the previous episode.</br>  <br>I do that every week, but of course you only get butthurt when I do it on the Bert episode. Don't assume everyone samefags just because you do it all the time.</br>  <br>You could also say BA is officially on the anime team's support list. So it looks like EM, YH and BA are the main pairings they push for, although that was obvious for a while now.</br>  Stream links where? I need my MikaQT feels  <br>Nobody enjoys it retard, keep ruining Bert though.</br>  <br>Seems like it. Although it might be confirmed by now that Bert will die saving Annie, if the extra drama in the episode meant anything.</br>  <br>No one wants you in the stream.</br>  <br>They were both love songs. The first low song might have been Bert's character song.</br>  <br>I got the feeling he would die saving her.</br>  It is 2015, how do streams manage to lag from too many viewers? please post a working link  <br>Yeah, I also assume this will happen for muh drama and Annie finally realizing that there is someone else who cares about her.</br>  <br> everyone always posts screenshots in every episode of every anime during the stream <br> everyone is okay with it <br> Bert episode <br> WHY ARE YOU DOING IT YOU ARE ANNOYING <br>It's pathetic how you spend most of your day hating on a character on an anonymous imageboard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The retard won't post his links he's too busy maintaining his samefag conversation and spamming his epic pics</br>  <br>He is butthurt because none of the pics so far included Mankasa.</br>  Why won't you guys post any stream links instead of forcing us to sit through your arguing?  <br>Or because he doesn't want you there shitting it up. Mikasa is worst girl by the way.</br>  <br>Please don't drag me into your shit posting friend !</br>  <br>Well there was no Mikasa in the episode, it's not my fault. And I like Chuugakkou Mikasa anyway so I don't get the butthurt.</br>  <br><br>Not really, the relationship she creates between BA, YH, EM and the others could very well mean nothing in the main manga. Just out of curiosity does Ibata introduced Historia or just Krista I don t read the Chuugakkou.</br></br>  <br>Hating? I'm annoyed you force us to read your same fagging instead of just posting a link.</br>  Why do any of you even care about Chuugakkou? It has no bearing on the actual manga. Even if it pushes BA, so what?  reminder  <br>Pretty much every official side material is doing that. Also, Ibata is not the author of the manga.</br>  <br>She is Krista in Chuugakkou, Frieda appeared but didn't recognize her as her sister but not because of the memory loss thing.</br>  <br>I posted a link, but a bling faggot that doesn't read the thread like you wouldn't have seen it anyway.</br>  <br>I wish they'd give up on the EA thing. You don't just forgive someone for killing your parents.</br>  <br>She had a few Historia moments in the manga. Actually, she only extremely acted as Krista in the beginning, but changed later on.</br>  subbed episode is out  <br>exactly.</br>  <br>This honestly, I just want to watch the episode I don't really care about any of your pictures lol...</br>  <br>She doesn't really talk anymore in the manga it seems. But in the anime so far she's just been Krista.</br>  Things the anime added:<br><br>Bert's sleeping positions<br>Reiner grabbing his arm<br>RY being more involved in Bert asking Annie out<br>Bert spills more spaghetti in the anime<br>Reiner has little scenarios with Choco Banana Bert and Candied Apple Annie<br>They took out the EA<br>Annie competes with Mikasa because they're rivals<br>Bert takes the slushie for Annie<br>He doesn't cry<br>There are two love songs that play when Bert and Annie have their scenes<br>It looks like they spent a lot of money on those scenes <br>Everyone does cut the cookie in the end, but Bert has a more natural relationship with Annie</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's an obnoxious newfag that probably doesn't lurk any other thread to know that anyway. Too bad mods don't give a fuck.</br>  <br>THE LINK DOESNT WORK RETARD</br>  <br> She doesn't really talk anymore in the manga it seems <br>Yeah, I noticed that too.</br></br>  <br>It seems they are </br>  <br> Annie <br> Killing Eren's parents <br><br>Get fucked, Mankasafag.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They also animated the RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW scene.<br><br><br>WELL THEN FIND ONE YOURSELF YOU CANCER. I can't believe you expect me to spoonfeed your whiny ass. The episode is over anyway and the subbed version is already out.</br></br></br></br>  <br> They took out the EA <br>fuck them so badly.</br></br>  <br><br>Well sure, but aren't most anime doing this for merchandise and money purposes? Doesn't necessary mean Isayama will lead to that also. <br><br><br><br>The fuck, I still don't understand why Krista is being introduced everywhere when her real self is Historia and they have quite different personalities, not even mentioning she is a better character as Historia than ship fodder.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they took out the EA <br><br>I am okay with this, It'd be neat though if Annie came out of the crystal and worked with the SL. Though that is probably not going to happen because she is a war criminal now.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you landwhale bitch, go loose weight.</br>  <br>It wasn't a love song, it was this one, at the 3:35 mark.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3Mb<wbr>YHNPD5Ps</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> Bert spills more spaghetti in the anime <br>So it delivers.</br></br>  <br>I think they just don't know how to depict Historia, because Ymir is still around and no one knows how she would act then. Or probably I'm just thinking too much into it. As for the pairings thing I don't think they're doing it for money, they are just establishing main pairings, otherwise the anime team would be supporting garbage like EL. Which is only done for merch purposes anyway.</br>  <br>So the average "suspense-before-action song" in the main series then.</br>  <br>Yes, but I'm not sure if you got what I was trying to say.</br>  <br> I think they just don't know how to depict Historia, because Ymir is still around and no one knows how she would act then. <br>Well they barely show up in the manga anyway, but I also got the feeling Saki doesn't know what to do with her comedy wise.</br></br>  Is there any better bro than Reiner?  <br>Which is weird because she has had a few comedic moments as Historia already in the main manga.</br>  <br><br> they are just establishing main pairings <br><br>They wouldn't establish pairings just for the keks believe me, it's only logically they would do that for money purposes especially since Isayama doesn't treat the romance aspect in his manga and nor would he make pairings just for the fujos and fujites without winning anything. He probably wants to cash in to as much money as he can before releasing anything new like Ymir, Bert dying destroying a pairing or two.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Again, if they're trying this for money purposes then the only pairings they would push for are Levi shit. Isayama doesn't seem to mind what the anime team support since he obviously collaborates and okay's things with them. Besides that, going by the manga then YH, EM and BA have always been the most blatant then Jean briefly had a crush on Mikasa and Reiner was deluded about Historia.</br>  <br> Well there was no Mikasa in the episode <br>LIESS</br></br>  <br>If they want money, they would pander mainly to manlet pairings. Actually, pretty much every official side material is pushing EM, BA and YH.</br>  <br>His shipperfaggotry with the banana and the lolipop was really sweet. Truly best bro.</br>  <br><br>Well Saki probably doesn't know what plans Isayama has with Ymir. Wouldn't surprise me if Isayama kills off Ymir which looks likely in the future while Saki will make Historia as a 2nd Mikasa reincarnation with a few more comedy and reactions from her similar to Mikasa.</br></br>  <br>Ymir always did seem likely to die but by that point I'm not sure if Chuugakkou will still even be running. Plus we truly don't know what Isayama plans, I mean he can't even kill off Sasha or Connie at this point. He teases death but really only kills fodders. I don't think I could see Historia being a second Mikasa, she has  too much personality  for that.</br>  <br>I don't get it either, but like I said YH barely appear in the manga spin off anyway. They are usually just in the background if anything. The spin off is mostly focusing on EMA and JSC.</br>  <br>So BRAYH and the veterans are mostly secondary? I haven't read the manga version in a long while, I like the anime adaption better.</br>  Is EA no longer popular? EL fujos would have had Ibata's head if he had removed a single manga interaction between Eren and manlet.  Mikasa's Kimono is cuter than Annie's Yuka.  <br>Does she dress up for the festival? My video won't render sadly.</br>  <br>It was never that popular. It certainly is no where near EL levels of popular either.</br>  <br><br><br>Well that answers that, she looks very cute though.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, they only occasionally get some focus, like the festival, valentine or Frieda chapters. It's mainly about EMAJSC.</br>  <br>Im not surprised by BRAYH not getting much focus but the veterans surprise me since they're more popular than the kids.</br>  <br>WHY YOU ALWAYS LYIN?</br>  <br><br>He probably wants to keep it as decent as possible Levi and Eren pairings are retarded btw.<br><br> Isayama doesn't seem to mind what the anime team support since he obviously collaborates and okay's things <br><br>Of course he doesn't mind since they must be earning something from them. Anime industry is just like the rest, trying anything to make money out of it, none would do it just for the purpose of doing but at the same time keeping it at a reasonable level. Also they couldn't add Levi since there is no romantic attraction from any of the 2 involve while Mikasa, Ymir and Bert who already been confirmed to have romantic feelings to the other 3. I don't think there is any mystery to this and why they do it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No one likes you Mikasa, consider sudoku.</br>  <br> kimono with that scarf <br>Terrible taste.</br></br>  <br>What is she giving him? A giant candy bar?</br>  <br>What the fuck is with Armin and that blanket</br>  <br>Again, if it was for money purpose then they would focus on Levi pairings. YH, EM and BA are indeed the most reasonable route in terms of canon.</br>  <br>I like EA a lot, but I wouldn't make that much of a scene because of it. EA has a lot of 'comercial' issues because it pisses both EM and EL fandoms, which are far huger.<br><br>Gladly that doesn't affect my interest in the pairing. In the end authors do whatever the fuck they want and Isayama has the story's end planned since it started so, I'll just sit and watch how things turn out.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'll admit, she was pretty adorable this episode. It's pretty annoying how they are forcing her to be Eren's babysitter...</br></br>  <br>Some stupid gimmick chuugakkou author gave him to try to make him more interesting.</br>  <br>Holy shit how you're mad because of one pic.</br>  <br>Mikasa is so boring, everything about her is terrible</br>  <br>That sounds so  mature </br>  <br>Just watched this part as well lol</br>  <br><br>I have no doubt Sasha will die her death was just delayed( It was already pointed out) he probably planned everything and we will see a lot more major deaths in the near future since the manga is over 60% done. It's only natural for the big deaths to happen close to the final.</br></br>  <br>There is a stall for Pork Cutlets? What kind of carnival is this?</br>  <br>It would make sense that a prominent character dies in this arc coming up since they're dealing with enemy shifters. Actually, I think Sasha is going to get the serum.</br>  <br>No they didn't focus on Levi pairings because it's a fucking landmine.</br>  Do these two ever stop fighting or will it be an ongoing joke? Pretty cute together though<br><br><br>I don't know, it's funny I guess.<br><br><br>Some type of prize from the   shooting competition.  <br><br><br>I like her though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Being a shipperfag in a lot of animu fandoms for over 15 years does that to a person, anon.</br>  <br>They do still pander to them though with EL, ErwL and LH merch, but mainly EL and ErwL. Levifags ruin everything with their shipping obsessions anyways.</br>  <br>Fuck s o o n?</br>  <br>You mean like manlet's shitty spin off? If they pander to manlet pairings, they usually pick ErwL, but it's not has often and blatant as EM, BA and YH.</br>  Is he getting madder?  <br>WHY WONT MY FUCKING VIDEO RENDER!??</br>    <br><br>Why would Levi be involved in any pairing merchandise when no one showed any romantic feelings for him and he didn't also. It's only natural they took the people who already been confirmed to be having a romantic attraction to someone else.Eren for Annie, or Annie with Armin was never confirmed even if hinted as MYB so it's only normal to go for those 3. I could be wrong of course but for me it looks logically as to "why/what/who" moves they took.</br></br>   Manletfags on Twitter whining about how they want the No Name ep already <br>Kek, so spoiled they can't even handle him not being the focus for a little while</br>  <br>I can't believe they made the fight joke again when it only happened once canon...</br>  <br>Holy shit, Annie is a cute. How would anyone pick Mikasa over her? Just look at those eyes, they could kill a man.</br>  <br>It's punishing you for all the evil you've inflicted upon this world.</br>  <br>Discussing Levi pairings is putting a gun on the head. Better pander to helpless pairings than start a war about something as asinine as an spin-off. Just see how they didn't dare to delve with the ACWNR. Marketing knows they can't be blatant.</br>  <br>Mikasa's Chuugakkou design looks retarded and badly drawn</br>  <br>Seems so. Funny enough he's doing that thing with Mikasa right now.</br>  <br><br> It's pretty annoying how they are forcing her to be Eren's babysitter... <br><br>Same thing in the main manga, don't see the difference desu.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I remember all the butthurt over ACWNR and the newest popularity poll.</br>  <br>The S2 references are all over the place. Trailer soon hopefully.</br>  <br>Manlet also has no officially stated feelings for anyone.</br>  <br>There has been some LH in the anime</br>  It was a good episode  <br><br> I think Sasha is going to get the serum <br><br>More like Connie..<br><br>I think someone major will die this arc for sure. Reiner, Erwin and maybe even one of MAL but that would be to early I believe.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because you're a fucking shitposter and you deserve it.</br>  <br>As I understand it, the anime did focus on LH but wasn't really presented as romantic. Eren is a Levifag but that offends no one. ErwL has some in the manga, but that can be taken any way you wish.<br> Why would Levi be involved in any pairing merchandise when no one showed any romantic feelings for him and he didn't also. <br>Because merch doesn't necessarily reflect of the manga. As I understand it, the anime did focus on LH but wasn't really presented as romantic and more for comedic purposes. Eren is a Levifag but that offends no one. ErwL has some in the the manga, but that can be interpreted many ways</br></br></br>  <br>Connie has business with MT. Sasha has no ties to the story whatsoever or popularity to keep her safe.</br>  <br>Some shipperfags are satisfied with anything. Sometimes they even make up things.</br>  <br><br>Also, they know how to milk Manlet. They can't go shipping with him, but the NoName band and the character song... is going to be annoying and a success.</br></br>  As a Mikasafag I'm not going to lie and say this scene wasn't cute as fuck.  <br>Her personality is also even more annoyingly Eren-centric, which is an accomplishment on its own.</br>  <br>Would fuck both at the same time</br>  <br>It was one of the better ones.</br>    <br>NoName is pretty much all that the majority of the nips care about when it comes to Chuugakkou. Notice the amount of attention the official pic got and how many fujos made their Twitter icons with the NoName bandages.</br>  <br>They sometimes tease with ErwL, but it is not as blatant as other pandering. They know fujos are satisfied with manlet just standing next to someone.</br>  <br> looks retarded <br>So they worked overtime to get her good?</br></br>  <br>Holy fuck just cute my shit up family, this might be my new favorite ship.</br>  <br>Reiner looks like he has seen some shit.</br>  Is the NoName episode going to be the finale?  <br>She even has lizard slit pupils as a result of her tiny chink eyes being vertically stretched to create an illusion of generic cuteness.</br>  I read this chapter but can't bring myself to watch this episode. It's too heart-rending.  <br>Probably, so fujos will keep watching until the end.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>I'm not sure how to feel about this statement.</br>  <br>Good note to end the episode on, both Annie and Mikasa were cute as fuck but Annie definitely stole the spotlight for me this time.<br><br>Looking forward to next weeks now.</br></br></br>  <br> Do these two ever stop fighting or will it be an ongoing joke? <br><br>Their fighting in the chuugakkou manga is usually over Eren's dick but in the anime it just seems that they dislike each other for no real reason.</br></br></br>  <br>Do it anon, it's worth the seizure, trust me.</br>  <br>Indeed. I don't know about ErwL lately. Chuugakkou don't have any Manlet-Erwin moments. But I remember the antics between Editor-kun and that Ererifujo. If that counts as ErwL teasing...</br>  <br>  it just seems that they dislike each other for no real reason. <br><br>Sexual tension.</br></br></br>  <br>Mikasa dislikes Annie because Eren talks to her, Annie dislikes Mikasa because Mikasa was a bitch to her.</br>  <br>He should've asked her out in this scene, dammit Berty.</br>  <br>They also have some LH, if I recall correctly. He gives Hanji something to eat in the manga, not the dogfood like in the manga but that can be taken any way. Shipperfags are probably the reason why Levi's most kind act was toward Armin so not to offend anyone.</br>  <br>They are both alpha.</br>  Ymir is most annoying shingeki.  <br>Has Ererifujo commited suicide yet? Or is she preparing a mass shooting against ErwLfags at the next Comiket?</br>  Why is Reiner baby sitting fucking Bort all episode instead of making a move on Krista?  <br>My new phone background, nice pic anon.</br>  <br>That's not Mikasa.</br>  <br> Or is she preparing a mass shooting against ErwLfags at the next Comiket? <br>She's probably taking all fujos down with her.</br></br>  <br>Hopefully the yurifags too.</br>  <br>Why did Eren not unwrap her dress right then and there?</br>  <br>He wants Blort to win the Annieb owl</br>  <br>Because bros before hoes.</br>  <br>He only cares about Bort's happiness.</br>  <br>Because he has good taste.</br>  <br>Didn't he want to take Krista with him to the festival in the manga but She wanted Ymir to come?</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Kek.</br>  <br>Kek. I just think Isayama and Editor-kun gave a shit about pairings, and more about Levi's parings, until the Ererifujo started with her autism. The answers I read were really childish; like they just teased with ErwL because the girl was being fucking annoying and self-absorbed.<br> Ererifujo kills tons of ErwLfags on comiket. Isayama makes ErwL official. </br></br>  <br>I think editor-kun was retarded for even responding.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>At least Mikasa is cute. Everything about Ymir is annoying.</br>  What's the Bortfag rating for this Bertisode?  <br> dislike each other for no real reason <br>Same reason why alphas in wolf packs compete with others to retain dominance. They are jealous of each other and want to prove who is stronger. Too bad Isayama doesn't know how to plot this out into an actual interesting scene and just pads to both sides.</br></br>  <br> Mikasa is cute. <br>Eh, no.</br></br>  <br>Not even a Bortfag but I thought it was really cute</br>  <br>Agreed.</br>  <br>Yes, I don't know what was he thinking. It wasn't professional at all teasing someone that's probably underage or a creep.</br>  <br>But they're not alpha.</br>  Annie was insanely qt this episode.<br><br> inb4 30 replies from Mikasafag </br></br>  <br>EAfags on suicide watch</br>  <br>No one cares about Bert and Annie. When will they show more Erwin and Hanji?</br>  <br>Yeah, and it only made retarded fujos even worse because they think it means he advocates for the other ship now. Again, Levifags are the cancer of this fanbase.</br>  <br>Never.</br>  <br>I liked it, BA was exciting and the end scene had me really enjoying it. 10/10<br><br><br>He should've just stuck to the fight scene and wrote something out instead of leaving us hanging like that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If Annie really loves Bort on the Isayama's manga, is going to be deeply stupid. Not even a hint on her side.</br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br>There is fake alphas who have to exert themselves through personality and alphas who came assert dominance through pure skills and natural ability.</br>  <br>It will make you butthurt as usual, but it was great.</br>   2/3 of nips (which is the only market that matters of Hajime) read it for manlet <br> probably half of them ship EL <br><br>I don't really think it would be a wise idea probably losing 40% of their readers just to piss off one underaged hamplanet fujo.</br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't mind if the Levifujos all dropped. Isayama has enough money now.</br>  <br>We never really did see her interact with Bert, probably for this reason.</br>  <br>pretty much. She never showed shit towards Bert not even a single hint (like the one we got from Bert), NOTHING.<br><br>She only cares about her mission, her father and maybe Eren.</br></br></br>  I was expecting a yandere laugh from Annie in the end.  <br>Annie only cared about Armin and Hitch.</br>    <br>The other half ship ErwL, he'll lose half of the fans one way or another.</br>  <br>40% of the merch buyers at most. Most normalfags will still read even when EM becomes canon.</br>  <br><br>Good riddance</br></br>  <br> 40% <br>They are much more. Isayama even talked about it.</br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br><br> tfw Isayama makes Armin deliver the new fact that Annie loves Bert through some random flashback scene we never paid attention, or that happened off-panel. </br></br>  <br>Is it safe to call this scene forced?</br>  <br>Annie didn't care about Armin, Hitch maybe.</br>  <br><br><br>It probably goes like this: half EL, 30% ErwL, 15% LH, the rest LM, minor pairings and people who still ship LP even after Petra got rekt.</br></br></br>  <br>LP is more popular than LM.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>I still can't believe LH is more popular than LM. I guess LH is more popular because it's the ugly girl ship.</br>  Annie cared about everyone in the 104th and tried to hide it, that was a big part of her whole thing. Trying to single out characters because she talked with them once is ridiculous.  <br>nips like Hanji more than Mikasa.</br>  <br>Maybe because LM is boring as shit and Mikasa is worst girl. I don't even like Manlet but at least there's some chemistry with LH.</br>  <br>Is because more landwhales can self-insert into the "quirky crazy nerd", which is completely false. Hange is not the annoying feminazi they want she to be.</br>  <br>This. She cared about fucking Connie, for fucks sake. When was discouraging him and Armin from joining the SL.<br><br>She cared about everyone in the 104th, just had a hard time demonstrating it because she isn't the chatty type.</br></br></br>  <br>Because Mikasa is a 15 year old that only gives a shit about Eren.<br><br>It took making them related for LM to get slightly popular.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm a bit disappointed because I really like RH and think it's cute. Oh well.</br>  <br>I did not give exact percentages. Plus, many jumped ship after Petra's death anyway.<br><br><br><br>Hanji is more popular exactly because she is paired with Levi. So is Erwin.<br><br>I think might make more sense making LH canon because of their pre-existing friendship that almost everyone likes; it's Hanji's main ship; Hanji's unknown gender can make it both straight (pandering to hetfags) and yaoi (pandering to fujos); EL and ErwL fujos will be pissed but can both say "well, at least it wasn't EL/ErwL"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If something happens from her side it will be after Bert saves her or confesses to her, which is tough because he'll most likely be dead after that.</br>  <br><br>Reiner and Ymir will both play poker in hell soon.</br></br>  <br> Hanji's unknown gender <br> hetfags <br>opinion discarded.</br></br></br>  <br>RH is just there to make Ymir beat Reiner up in the spinoffs</br>  <br> She cared <br>She was being a coward who couldn't say she was going to try to kill them. An act of mercy turns into a fucking joke when it comes from a mass murderer.</br></br>  <br>Well since BA and RH are my main ships it would have been cool to see both get pandering but I do realize things were cut and changed for the anime.</br>  <br>I really thing Bert will be the last one to die.</br>  <br>And to add more YH.</br>  <br><br>This is better than porn for me.</br></br>  <br>Ymir needs to fuck off damnit ;_;</br>  <br>This might be the case, but I don't see him surviving so it would mean that all of BRA would be dead in the end.</br>  <br>Sooner than you think.</br>  <br>Reiner pls</br>  <br>I hate how he walks away like a diva, like Bert just stop.</br>  <br>Even if I consider her a killer, I think it would be out of character if she doesn't recognize Bert's help in the case he protects her.</br>  <br>You think Annie will die first? I got the feeling that Annie will survive until the end, since she did lots of shit already but managed to survive even in defeat.</br>  <br>BRAYE will be kill at the end, Eren must likely the last, taking the coordinate with him.</br>  <br><br>Well she ain't gonna die in Chuugakkou but might completly change her relationship with Historia, while in the manga it's almost close to an easy bet Ymir will die at some point. Sad thing in all this is Reiner will die also.</br></br>  <br> ugly girl ship <br>But Hanjo is way cuter than Mikasa</br></br>  <br>Well, so did Bert and Reiner.</br>  <br>Mein sides.</br>  <br>Name of the insert song?</br>  <br>Maybe Reiner will get to see Historia's thighs one last time before he is kill.</br>  <br><br>More like RYBE in that order.<br><br>Doubt Isayama made her survive only to kill her later would be pointless.</br></br></br></br>  <br>In the Frieda and Valentine's chapter it's implied they are in a relationships.</br>  <br>Did you really expect an undercover spy to go 'yo I'm going to kill all of you, be warned'? <br><br>She was very considerate of them by detaching herself from them so they don't get too attached and later disappointed.</br></br></br>  <br>LH is both Levi and Hanji's most boring ship. I prefer LM but even EL has more appeal.</br>  <br>They might change the "getting kill" to "moving far away without notice".</br>  <br>LM is way more boring.</br>  Death probable timeline:<br>Ymir&gt;Reiner&gt;Annie&gt;Bertolt&gt;Eren.</br>  I liked the change of Bert being against the jumping in front of the stain plan in this episode  <br>more like <br>Reiner&gt;Erwin&gt;Levi&gt;Ymir&gt;Bert&gt;Annie</br></br>  <br>LM is still developing while LH has stayed stagnant.</br>  <br>I don't think Hange is canonically pretty. She still is one of my favorites.</br>  <br>More like<br>Reiner&gt;Bert&gt;Annie&gt;Ymir&gt;Eren</br></br>  <br>That's with shifters. I'm 85% sure Ymir will be the first to go.</br>  <br>no. Kill yourself, I don't even care much about the manlet but LM is the most retarded thing imaginable.</br>  <br>Not really. Annie's battle is over, Reiner and Bert are still fighting their battle right now. If they survive this arc and reunite with Annie, though, it'll be hard to guess which one of them is going do die first or if any of them is going to die at all.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, this could very well be the case actually. We will see in the near future I believe.</br></br>  <br>Reiner&gt;Levi&gt;Bert&gt;Erwin&gt;MT-Eren</br>  <br>Ok but you can still be cute even if you're not pushed as pretty.</br>  <br>Annie if Isayama does indeed kill which I very much doubt it won't be until the final chapters like Eren.</br>  <br>Just like Frieda, Grisha, Carla, Ilse, Levi's old squad and Mike.</br>  <br><br>I hope Ymir dies first</br></br>  <br>I agree with this anon. Annie already survived her death flags which are gone by now. I highly doubt she is going to die. She didn't die when she had the chance. Isayama clearly have plans for her.</br>  <br>Personality is the most important thing. How she handled Nick, and how she decided to go with the torture despite her own doubts, her dedication to solve the titan problem... There are a lot of things I love about her character.</br>  <br>She was stuck in a crystal for over 3 years now. Obviously nothing was going to happen to her for a while.</br>  <br><br>More like second after Reiner..</br></br>  <br>I lied. It was hype.</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>Three years = three months.</br>  <br>Hanji is great, I think the anime downgraded her a little though.</br>  <br>Neither did Bertolt and Reiner for the matter. Isayama does have plans for her, but when they're done she's done.</br>  <br>Call your name</br>  Why is Annie's nose so small?  <br>I don't know, but I'm pretty upset about it.</br>  <br>I'm sorry but you're seriously deluded if you think BR are equally important to the plot as Annie. Not that Annie is that much important or anything, far from it, she is a secondary character, but she is, yes, more important than Reiner and Bertholt. For a couple reasons: Her relationship with EMA characters, which are the most important characters, her backstory with her father which was left open etc.</br>  <br> I'm sorry but you're seriously deluded if you think BR are equally important to the plot as Annie. <br>If you're Anniefag, chill bro.</br></br>  I like that Chuugakkou makes Annie and Historia friends  <br> you're seriously deluded if you think BR are equally important to the plot as Annie <br>Someone is deluded here and it's certainly not him.</br></br>  <br><br>He is right though.</br></br>  <br>Yes, because they are best girls</br>  <br>Elaborate then. How is Annie more important to the plot than the Armored and Colossal titans?</br>  <br>By actually having connections with other characters (EMA and her douchebag father) and not being just a plot device.</br>    <br>That's not being important to the plot. Connie and Sasha also have connections with everyone, does that make them more important than Annie?</br>  <br>BR do have connections with EA though.</br>  <br>By the way Annie helped to take down Wall Maria by calling the titans too.<br>Also, going by that line of thought Bertholdt, Reiner and Annie are the most important characters in this series, losing to Eren only. <br><br>Which we know it's not true.</br></br></br></br>  <br>C-Cute.</br>  <br>They are plot important, that's exactly what it means. So is Erwin, Eren, Armin and Historia. It has nothing to do with how many connections and friendships they have with other characters.</br>  <br>Not, because they weren't the main focus of an entire fucking arc.</br>  <br>BR were and they are again now, how is Annie more important again?</br>  <br>I was not measuring importance by connections. I was just saying that Annie was the least likely of RBA to die (or at least she probably will be the last one to die) because she has more relationships. Therefore, more stuff left open.<br><br>I hope they all survive somehow though. Even though things are really difficult for Reiner atm I still have hope.</br></br></br>  <br>BR is a group, they even have Ymir sometimes. Annie is a single character.</br>  So far episodes 8 and 9 were better than the majority of Chuugakkou.   Staretolt   <br>She doesn't have any more connection to EMA than BR do, and those connections are dead now anyway. There's nowhere for it to go for any of them. <br><br>You're also ignoring that Bert, Reiner, and Annie all have connections with each other that do have room and potential for development. Her future events are likely going to be tied in with them.</br></br></br>   RBAfags fighting like children again   <br>It's usually BR or BRA.</br>  <br>Ymir's not really apart of their group.</br>  <br> legs on the chair arms <br> ???? </br></br>  <br> She doesn't have any more connection to EMA than BR do, <br><br>I like how you completely ignore that Annie is some sort of 'mentor' figure to Eren, which is pretty huge since he is the motherfucking main character. <br><br>Get real.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Berthol sounds like some kind of drug.  Cute </br>  <br>She was, even if for some days.</br>  <br>Ok but she's not really "apart" of them. It's BRA, even if Annie was acting solitary.</br>  <br>Still doesn't make them a group. It's still BRA.</br>  <br> Eren by Mikasa trying to hold her hand </br>  <br>In general yes, but I was talking about the last two arcs. Annie isn't with them.<br><br><br>I know, but I wanted to play carefully since Ymir is not really RBA, she is just a conflicted character.</br></br></br></br>  Do RBAfags consider Ymir a part of their group?    <br>She didn't take part in the wall attack so why would she be apart of their trio?</br>  <br>You know what's worse? I watched Kill la Kill literally three times and never noticed it. Lazy animators I guess.</br>   mfw I'm literally Ymir right now.     <br>I like the idea, but she isn't... yet.</br>  <br>an ugly dyke that can transform into an ugly manlet titan?</br>  <br>Sorry to hear about that misfortune.</br>  <br> yet <br>Nah.</br></br>  <br>She isn't going to be. She's mostly on the SL's side.</br>  <br>My condolences.</br>  <br>Just the shirt and pants.</br>  <br>Too bad they removed that part with Historia's sandal breaking.</br>  <br>So you're dressed like a 70's outcast?</br>  <br>And Historia slapping Bert to confess.</br>  <br><br>You guys can dislike Ymir all you want, I won't argue, but I like her. And I think she could have an interesting dynamic with Annie.</br></br>  <br>That too.</br>  <br>How is saying what side she's on disliking her?</br>  <br> You guys can dislike Ymir all you want <br>I don't dislike her though.</br></br>  <br>Then you can ignore that part on my previous post.</br>  <br>I was just being cautions since everyone in these threads seems to hate Ymir.</br>  <br>Pratically.</br>  <br>Well Ymir would be shitty then to betray her friends like that</br>  <br>And Bert crying while playing trim the cookie. It was a good episode but the manga had good parts too.</br>  Was the student council president stuff from next episode in the manga?  <br>Never</br>  <br>You need a better fashion sense.</br>  <br> Berthole </br>  <br>Everyone hates everything here.</br>  <br><br>Ymir isn't ugly, she's a okay.</br></br>  <br>Not that anon, but a shirt and pants isn't that outdated.</br>  <br>Those colors together are bad. Red pants?</br>  <br>You would be surprised with the amount of Ymirfags around.</br>  Ymirfags popping up to ruin the thread. Disgusting  <br>Red shirt and black pants actually.</br>  <br>I agree with the colors together, but red pants aren't that bad, depending on how you combine it.</br>  <br>That's better then. Good on you.</br>  <br> thus fujo looks like a literal Saturn hamplanet </br>  <br>Red and black can sometimes look too edgy, but red pants are pretty bad. Reversing it like anon did is better.</br>  Are we really discussing what an anon is wearing and if it's in fashion?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>pls deliver, Isayama</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Still better than flowers.</br>  <br>I want moar Historia/Annie</br>  <br>Isayama told Ibata how Bert was going to die and that's why the icecream scene turned out like that.  ;_; </br>  <br>I have more.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Sadly, there isn't that much. I want them to interact in canon just to see how it'd turn out.</br>  <br>There's a chance, since Historia stayed behind and Annie is still inside the walls.</br>  Why is anime oversexualized?  <br>If a girl shitting out paint from her vag onto a canvas is "art" to some chuckle fuck sjw gaylords why can't some cartoons with sexy children every now and then be art?</br>  <br>Oh come on, that sounds quite plausible. Shit like "a giraffe is coming out of my ass!" is crazy.</br>  <br>Cocoa is tasty down there as well</br>  <br>You think anime made up these situations?</br>  <br>Here you are wrong hue friend.<br><br>I LIKE lewd on animes, I just dont like the autistic kind of thing that people of this board think its good. More than half of this board is just about it, unlike every other board related to other forms of media.<br><br>There is a reason why /a/ is considered the board with the most patethic users after rk9.</br></br></br></br></br>  OPM chapter 84 is done. There is one doublespread that isn't in the raws but Murata added it to twitter, so i added that as well.  <br>DON'T BULLY THE METAL BAT.</br>  <br>What does the misplaced threat level have to do with that?<br>The very definition of the threat levels themselves means that Boros is a god level threat. What is so hard to understand about that?</br></br>  For tomorrow's episode. Seems like they're mentioning the main animator.<br><br>https://twitter.com/opm_anime/statu<wbr>s/670545281029701632</wbr></br></br>  where the fuck can I read this shit? nowhere has proper chapter listings  <br>That the databook says otherwise? That ONE didn't say that he's God level? Just a guess.</br>  Fuck you Miura.  the new art style creeps me out desu<br>they all look like wax dolls or something, especially the eyes look dead<br><br>i hope its just miura being a bit stiff after hiatus and he'll get back to his style a few years back</br></br></br>  <br>lol "hiatus". that break will probably be the shortest for the rest of the series until miura dies</br>  <br><br>I suspect the change in art is due to the following:<br><br>1. Sped up schedule<br>2. Assistants actually doing a lot<br>3. Digital art<br><br>Noticed the last chapter looks like it was drawn digitally. If that's true that would make a major boost in the speed of the releases.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Listen to this while you read Berserk<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xSs<wbr>FkdbV6YE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Where are the fucking translations??</br>  <br>reeeeee</br>  Should I just use this thread to dump the second volume or make a new one?  <br>Dump it here bro.</br>  <br><br>it's pretty baffling that a series this huge takes this long to get translated</br></br>  <br>Would be cooler if you make a new thread but you can dump it here too.</br>  <br>Make a new thread because this one is going to be full of people replying to OP's fake pic.</br>  Shit man, I can't even believe I'm reading this right now. I realised that the magazine came today so I went and bought it.   tits are censored   <br>Fuck, for some reason it didn't turn the picture. Well, you can do it by yourselves.</br>  <br>Man, Izma is really cute.</br>  <br><br> Noticed the last chapter looks like it was drawn digitally. <br><br>You are not the first to point this out, but I don't see it? If anything the scans we've been getting seem worse to me. I expect it to look much better once the whole volume is out.<br><br>And I don't think it would be speed up the process, because I believe that detailed art is not what was holding it up in the first place.<br>Before 2006 Miura published twice the number of Berserk issues he does nowadays and that did not reflect on art.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Izma is best girl</br>  <br><br>No they are not. They just don't show in this particular pannel. We so both Isma's and Mom's nipples already. And just a few issues ago we saw Luca, Pepe and Erica naked.</br></br>  <br><br>Guys, I'm crying right now<br><br>they finally stepped off the boat<br><br> people died waiting for this chapter ;_; </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please make it wrong island so they have to get back to the boat and continue the journey.</br>  <br>It looks a hundred times better on paper than those shitty korean scans. I wish i could read it like that every month</br>    <br>Actually I was a little suprised at the quality too. At least Jump is usually printed in a bad quality.</br>  <br>Damn, I wonder why the pictures are in a right way in my computer but when I post them on 4chan they are turned sideways.</br>  <br>A setting on your phone. I bet you didn't even delete the location data.</br>   Already out in spanish, rus, portuguese and 1 million other languages <br> Not in english <br><br>Holy crap who does Berserk?</br></br></br>  <br>The art peaked at the apostles tower arc.</br>  <br>I dont remember that, can you post source or smth?</br>  <br>I took them by a camera so I don't have to worry about my location. I guess you can see what my camera model is but I don't care about that.</br>  <br>best berserk</br>  <br>I just want big animu eyes to go.</br>  <br><br>IIRC 4chan is blocking that data from images nowadays.</br></br>  <br>I see, well I guess I'll try one more time without the data from images. Just pure image.</br>   21 years old   <br><br>Here'ya go. Teen girl + MILF nipple combo.</br></br>  <br>The art looks as good as ever. And people were saying that it was getting worse.</br>  <br><br>This is true, it's the scans that are getting shitty not art.</br></br>  <br>the art looks good but people mostly complain about faces and eyes.</br>  <br>They are a bit different. More moe. But it's hardly new.</br>  <br><br> The first bubble didn't even say "that was fast" it doesn't even have 速い on it. Korean TL shit tier confirmed. </br></br>  <br>its a joke.</br>  <br>Who are you quoting?</br>  <br>It was a joke</br>  The art isn't getting worse or less detailed, but there it is slightly different. Miura obviously needs to work faster, there aren't even any double-page spreads.  Probably because it's taken from a camera, but still, it looks better than the scans.  <br>the contrast is bad for scan</br>  <br>yeah I don't think we've gotten a double page spread since the monthly publications, and I agree, I don't think the art has gotten worse overall, it's just the way he draws the eyes now which might be off putting. <br>I think he still got it, it's just his spreads stick out as particularly good, and since there weren't any it seems worse compared to previous chapters.</br></br>  <br>not learning spanish or chinese two of the most speaked lenguage<br>or japanese since its the original</br></br>  I've been thinking about the end game for berserk and one thing has been sticking out<br><br>How exactly is Guts even going to fight Griffith? Not only is griffith on some jesus level of bullshit powerful but guts still has the brand. Do you think Schierke is able to mitigate the effects of the brand when Guts gets close to Griffith? Do you think he'll just end up using the berserk armor instead?</br></br>  <br>Griffith is gonna go for Guts boipussy, but little did our demon emperor know Guts had his sword Dragonslayer™ hidden in there.<br>In the aftermath of that action Griffiths penor gets split open and then Guts fires of hid Handcannon™ straight into the opening thus defeating the evil Griffith.</br></br>    <br>It was a troll, somone already translated it into English</br>  <br>I forgot, why is the mermaid girl coming with them?</br>  <br> luca pepe and erica <br><br>I dont remember that</br></br></br>  <br> get off the boat <br> get on a little boat </br></br>  <br>chapter 334</br>  <br>Man I want to see them having a violent and rough sex</br>  <br>Because she's literally made of pure sex and Miura likes drawing her.</br>   translation never   Where is the translation guys?<br><br>Are the translators imitating Miura or what?</br></br>  <br>TLs are out!</br>    <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/mangafox/</br>  <br>good taste</br>  <br>21 is basically 48 in medieval years.</br>   They get off the boat <br> Its not really elfheim <br> Boat Arc continues <br> Pirates return <br> They go to demon pirate island instead <br> yfw </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> yfw they found the one piece before luffy. </br>  <br><br><br> They crash with the Dark Continent expedition boat </br></br></br>  <br>It leaked in Korean. Not many scanlators know korean, yet alone any who'd do a half decent job of localizing the dialogue.</br>  <br>Yet this scan is in 7 languages now and eglish is nowhere to be seen</br>  <br> 7 languages <br> not english <br>when did the anlosphere become so irrelevant?</br></br></br>  <br><br>WHOA WHOA WHOA HOLD THE FUCKING PHONE!<br><br>Are they actually for real seriously getting off that god damn smelly rotten fucking slow as shit boat?<br><br>Did Christmas come a few weeks early?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The other translations are pretty shitty honestly, maybe the english ones are just taking their time.</br>  <br>He's seen some shit to be fair</br>  <br>Dont see the problem. He looks like a man in his twenties.</br>  <br>any of them in spanish?</br>  <br> I'm as old as Guts <br><br>I've done nothing with my life.</br></br></br>  <br> they creash with the dark continent expedition boat <br> reality ceases to exists <br> when it comes back everything in our world moves in slow motion </br></br></br>  <br>and you never will</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>Guts is only 21?<br>What the fuck</br></br>  <br>Neither have the rest of the twenty-one-year-olds, you're fine.

Aside from Miura's old fashioned personality making him stick with traditional ink and paper, there's no way he could make the jump that smoothly. Not unless the long breaks where actually him practicing with digital.</br></br></br>  <br> He missed the sticky </br>  <br>Jesus fuck. Finally?<br><br>I can't believe the day has finally come.</br></br></br>  Is there good porn with Guts and Schierke?  <br>Nevermind that, theres no good porn of guts and farnese.</br>  <br>Where's the porn of Farnese and Casca?</br>  <br><br><br>At least Caska got some love during the movie releases.<br><br>Schierke and Farnese doujins would exist if the movies didn't bomb so hard that they were dropped.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 7 YEARS ON THE BOAT IRL <br> NOT EVEN 1 IRL </br></br>  <br>Because I don't want to read shitty languages.</br>  <br>Learn Japanese and become a translator anon.</br>   all these people that missed the glorious sticky   before it turned to shitposting .  <br>Don't lie anon, it was shitposting from beginning to end.</br>  <br>They bombed? Why? I thought they were quite good</br>  <br>Not really, it had some shitposts in the middle but it wasn't completely derailed into shitposting right away. Either way it was nice, a historic moment for all of us who were with Guts on the boat.  Hopefully this really is Elfhelm </br>  <br>what's wrong with sh*tposting</br>  <br><br>I always thought he was at least 23 or so by the golden age and nearing his 30s in the current arc, what the fuck</br></br>  <br> don't forget you are here forever <br>Finally remembered. <br><br>(pic unrelated)</br></br></br></br>   Schierke won't be brutally raped and killed by demons in your life time   <br>No one has been raped in Berserk since Guts destroyed that avatar of Slan.<br><br>M E T A<br>E<br>T<br>A</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>HOLY SHIT THEY LEFT THE BOAT AND THEY ARE WALKING ON LAND. WHAT A DEVELOPMENT.</br></br>  <br>Because they didn't stick with an audience. Newcomers won't get what's going on because they're so disjointed and fans didn't like it because of all the changes and cuts that were made.<br><br>Personally, I think they would've been more successful if they just skipped the Golden age arc altogether and went straight for Lost Children arc.</br></br></br>  <br>This is longer than namek</br>  <br>Every sticky turns into shitpost, anon.</br>  <br>There's wizards and Puck got past the barrier, it's Elfhelm.</br>  <br>Over a year has passed since he met puck.</br>  <br>23, faggot.<br>Sk timeline was confirmed garbage years ago.</br></br>  We might actually be nearing the moment of truth.<br><br>What do you think's gonna happen with Casca?</br></br>  Why is E-G down?  English yet?  <br>But this very issue has at least two double page spreads (pages 2 and 3 plus the one where the scarecrow comes to life). C'mon people, let's pay more attention here!</br>  <br><br>You don't remember it because you just skimmed through it, like all of you goddamn kids do these days!<br><br>It seems like only sad old fuckers like me actually read the manga, not just blast through 30 volumes in one afternoon.<br><br>Anyway, here's the page.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>understandable. <br>Personally, I ignored the sticky because I looked at the opening image &amp; not the text</br></br>  <br> medieval life expectancy was half ours meme <br>You ought to say that 21 is 48 in struggler years.</br></br>  <br>nigga i can read the whole manga in two days</br>  <br> implying english isnt a shitty language </br>  <br>Say what you will about Griffith, he knows how to deliver a mind-blowing orgasm.</br>  <br>I too enjoy skimming through manga at the speed of light</br>  <br><br>Yeah? Well I can do it in a month and a week. Beat that!</br></br>  <br>please translatorfags do it, the original line is totally irrelevant</br>  <br>no, its just im not retarded</br>  WHERE THE FUCK IS THE TRANSLATION  See maybe Miura is such a detailfag that maybe he actually looked up how long a boat ride would take between a pre determined destinations. Then actually took as long as he did to get off the boat.  <br> Digital Art  <br> Speeds up production <br><br>Good one. The only thing that would be more expedient digitally would be doing halftones and fills. Traditional linework is much more efficient if done right.</br></br></br></br>  <br>poorfag detected</br>  <br>Keep telling yourself that.</br>  <br>I have a $400 Intuos. I stand by my statement. The only thing that digital work is more efficient at is coloring and fills. Linework and sketching is done faster traditionally.</br>   There are people here who think guts lost everything <br><br>The real hero of the story is Skull Knight, he lost his kingdom, his people, his friend (witch) and his body and has been chasing the demons for eons.</br></br>  <br> The real hero of the story is Skull Knight <br>My nigga, i get hard everytime thinking about his obligatory flashback</br></br>  <br> tfw guts is going to kill skull knight </br>  <br> implying english isnt a shitty language </br>  <br>Was he ever raped by a giga nigga? Has he spent eternity on a boat?</br>  <br>i really wanted that to happen, way back in the golden age</br>  <br>He puked an eye covered sword my man</br>  <br><br><br> Implying that Guts and Skull Knight won't come up with a way to rape Griffit <br><br>No homo tho, it's a power thing</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well, eye for an eye my friend</br>  <br> Yfw Guts rapes Zodd because that's the closest person to Griffit now <br><br>Kek</br></br></br>  <br>Wouldn't it be the psychic girl or the princess? Why would it be Zodd, he's just Griffith's unicorn. He's probably all sad somewhere in a forest cause he has nothing to fight that'll satisfy him</br>  <br>This so much</br>  <br>when did they make a manga out of this anime?<br>i hope they expanded on it and didn't leave it a cliffhanger like in the series.</br></br>  Griffith did nothing wrong  <br>Guts subverted whatever fate they had planned for Rickert and her.</br>  <br>Except everything</br>  is the chapter translated yet? i can't find it anywhere  <br>1/10</br>  <br>how do you even come up with this and then think it's okay to post.</br>  How long was the hiatus exactly?  https://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLY<wbr>_iQxGU</wbr>  [ ]  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;134051824 <br> feels <br>Kill yourselves.</br></br></br>  guys I cant get to evil geniuses help  <br>I can't either.

Guts is still on the boat. We're all on the boat. Forever.  I can't fucking believe it. They're getting off the boat. <br><br>Its been 8 years. I was in elementary school when they got on the boat.

I think the best thing for berserk would to do a game adaption, Action-rpgs are finally good enough to handle something like berserk well, dark souls was massively popular and it practically lifts a lot of its aesthetics and lore straight from berserk.<br><br>I really do think that if some company came out with a berserk game right now that it'd sell like nothing else.</br></br></br>  <br>why is behelit sword so fucking smug ?</br>  <br>Some OC for you lot.</br>  It's been so long I forgot; why did they have to go to the island?  <br>saved</br>  <br>Jesus anon.<br>The whole point of the story was to get to a place where Guts and Casca could retire.</br></br>  <br><br>Thanks</br></br>  <br>Oh so it's ending soon huh</br>  <br><br>Thought it was revenge and to butt fuck the hand gods with a skull knight buddy.</br></br>  <br>Ippo was defending his title for the eighth time against Kojima Hisato. Some fuck nobody remembers.</br>  <br>You know, you can tell how long its been simply by the fact that people think the goal was to fix Casca. In reality, Guts didn't learn that it was a possibility until they had reached the sea. He was fully resigned to just talking care of her retarded ass until she or he died. He was originally going to settle down at Goto's mine, but Zodd wrecked it.</br>  How come Guts doesn't have a beard?  <br>Death Note had recently ended.<br>The Arrancar arc was starting.<br>Thors had just died in Vinland Saga.<br>Code Geass had just started.<br><br>Some people don't get them until the mid 20s. Also most of his face is scar tissue.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Also most of his face is scar tissue <br>Nigga, most of his body is scar tissue.</br></br>   of the boat   <br>Nichijou, M×0, Mysterious Girlfriend X, Highschool of the Dead and Hetalia also started that year.</br>  <br><br><br>Simply drawing is going to go about the same speed both digitally and traditionally. However the inherent non destructive nature of digital art is going to make any production go faster even if you're talking purely about linework.</br></br></br>  <br>Because no one can keep it out.</br>  I don't actually believe ANY of this shit!<br>This has been close to a decade of suffering for us to see those fuckers on solid ground again.<br>Someone post me a damn picture of them off the boat. I don't care if it is covered in crazy moonspeak.<br><br>I just... need to see it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>In the time since then:<br> FMA and Naruto ended. <br> Soul Eater went from 2 years old to finished, then Ohkubo started a new manga. <br> HiatusxHiatus got on a boat then went on hiatus. <br> Hellsing Ultimate began and finished its run. <br> Hellsing ended and Drifters began. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here<br/></br>  What the fuck they got of the boat?!  Here comes a question from a Berserk Newfag.<br><br>I read the first volume and it's basically pic related with good art. Does this get more story? Or is it basically just Guts rampaging trough hordes of enemies.</br></br>    <br>Nice reddit image, shitposter.</br>  <br>Who is the guy in middle? Looks like sailor. Is it some manga about adventures on sea?</br>  of the Boat! Merry Christmas everyone  <br>It's an image i had years ago, deleted it sometime and just searched for this exact comic because i always had this in mind when i read it. It's fucking old, so don't you talk shit about it.</br>  <br>It's both of those things anon, guts cutting dudesd in half and story arn't mutually exclusive. After the first 2-3 volumes you get the longest flashback ever that fleshes out gut's character and it's fucking amazing.</br>  <br>Just read the damned thing and form your own opinion. It's not like you don't have the time.<br><br>And post a good version, newfag.</br></br></br>  <br>meant for<br><br><br>Also, did you guys hear about the black swrodsman/white hawk armor being in dark souls 3?<br><br>Hyped for that guts rp lads.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure, and you just happened to end up in reddit right?<br><br>Fuck off. Go find some naruto thread to shitpost.</br></br></br>  <br>I like the bit where you made the examples bigger to show how big of a deal it is because I'd be too retarded to figure that out</br>  <br>First day?</br>  <br>off<br><br>I seriously can't believe it lads</br></br></br>  UNTIL YOU LIKE IT  <br><br>thanks, sounds good<br><br><br>just wanted to know if it stays like that<br><br><br>You're cute somehow. You always here?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Would you adopt one, /a/?  <br>every retard does it to emphasize le fannies for some reason because it's ebin humor that carried over from /v/ screencaps and then replicated to other boards when they do similar shit</br>   &gt;Guts, Caska and Griffith will never have a loving mmf threesome <br><br>why even live</br></br>  <br>Look how cute they are. Dindu nuffin.</br>  <br>Shark crying?</br>  <br>They are tears of joy</br>  <br> Shingeki no Kyojin started and got an anime <br> Shokugeki no Souma started and got an anime <br> Nisekoi started and got an anime <br> Onepunch-Man started and got an anime <br> Kingdom started <br> GATE (the manga) started <br> Vinland Saga turned into Farmland Saga and into Feminismland Saga <br> Prison School started and got an anime <br> Terra Formars started and got an anime <br> Shigurui ended <br> Ippo got braindamage but then didn't, Takamura nearly lost a fight <br> Kohinata lost a title fight and is now back in the race, in fact his first fight since then is happening right now <br> One Piece finally got out of the worst arc ever <br> Bleach is doing whatever (dropped it) <br><br>Even Vagabond updated a few times.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> i'm in it <br>noice</br></br>  <br> because I'd be too retarded to figure that out <br>Yeah, probably.</br></br>  <br>Then I calm</br>  <br>This is a hairs width removed from "MUH MALE POWER FANTASY" straight out of SJW Tumblr.<br><br>What happened to this place?</br></br></br>  <br>source for the armors in ds3?</br>  <br> &gt;Bleach is doing whatever (dropped it) <br>Ichigo finally defeated Aizen, lost his powers, went back to monster-of-the-week slice of life like the beginning of the comic for like 3 months, Ichigo regained his powers, the Quincies came back, A the Asspull broke the universe of the manga even more.</br></br>  <br> What happened to this place? <br>That comic has been around for over 7 years, newfag. Go back to shitposting on /v/.</br></br>  <br>Contrarians happened, Berserk is popular so people are hyper critical of it. It's only got worse since the advent of the "hipster" meme, it let's these fucks dismiss anything with a cult following like berserk without ever having read it. <br><br>Anyone else notice it's mostly bonafide hipsters that throw the term around so liberally?</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4Vn<wbr>LY_iQxGU</wbr>  [ ]  <br>It's from Plebbit, you fucking malignant tumor, a place that you should return to.</br>  <br> &gt;an image from 08 <br> &gt;not new <br><br>Anybody who came to this website after 06 is "new".</br></br></br></br>  <br> protomen  <br> nice boat <br>I love you demo-senpai</br></br></br>  <br>Wow, i'm glad i missed that.</br>  <br>When is Schierke going to get boned?</br>   mfw people had to wait 7 year for gats to get off the boat <br> mfw only had to wait about 6 months </br>  <br>Soon I hope, I've been waiting almost a decade for her to get Guts' thick dragonslayer, but all we've gotten was troll rape and dream sex. <br>Fucking soon.</br></br>  Rereading is neat. I never remember shit from first reads.  <br>Pointing out that this was the event that triggered the creation of the Hound personality. Or it least gave it shape.</br>  <br>It wasn't the first time he went berserk though. Or mentioned blacking out fear. Most my images aren't named though beyond the default so I can't find it right at the moment.</br>  So how is Guts going to react when he learns that he's not quite as human as he'd thought?  <br>jokes on you I'm on chapter 2 right now.</br>  <br>I honestly think it first took shape when guts killed that kid on his assassination mission for Griffith. He can't help but see himself in the kid and then he ends up killing him. His conscience died that day, or at least this is when he learned to truly suppress it.</br>  <br> tfw you   ship Schierke x Isidro </br>  <br>At least Guts doesn't have that superjaw anymore</br>   evil genius down for 24 hours already <br><br>CAN YOU FAGGOTS STOP DDOSING THEM<br><br>LET ME REFRESH THE SITE<br><br>ALSO WHAT THE FUCK IS TAKING THEM SO LONG</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm started 3 days ago and i'm already halfway through volume 37</br>  <br>The Hound personality is introduced (ish, it is described but has no voice) after that fight.<br><br>The chapter is called "Beast of Darkness".</br></br></br>  <br>Faggot, he has the mergirl.</br>  <br>dumb frogposter</br>  <br>Not the personality itself, I know. But this wasn't its first foreshadowing.</br>  <br>I had a good chuckle.</br>  <br>I choose to think that this fight caused the actual splintering.</br>  <br>This is the dream he has straight after he kills him.</br>  <br>earliest foreshadowing of the black beast I can think of, though it's obviously not in the form it is later but instead symbolized by zodd.</br>  <br>Is it yours perhaps? This is some autistic bullshit that began on /v/ in the last year by the Twitch kiddies who don't take their rohypnol and valium prescription.</br>  <br>Demo could make a really cool cosplay of Guts if he became fit.</br>  <br>Luca is best girl<br>Also why why is it so satisfying to hear peoples reaction to guts?</br></br>  <br>We all could make a really good cosplay of something if we got fit.<br><br>But we're all lazy fucks, aren't we.</br></br></br>  <br>the reaction panels to guts annihilating a monster or group or whatever is one of my favourite parts of the manga. The one at the church where he cuts the ogres arm off is the best.</br>  <br>BITCH WE BEEN WAITING SEVEN YEARS FOR THIS</br>  <br> tfw manlet <br>I wouldn't make a good guts even if I were fit</br></br>  <br>You'd probably make good Edward Elric.</br>  <br>What do you mean</br>  <br>What are you listening to while rereading berserk gents?</br>  <br> 2:14 <br><br>HAHA JUST NOTICED GUTS</br></br></br>  <br>The circumstances of his birth make it too obvious. He's half human, half something.</br>  <br>TEN FUCKING YEARS!!! STICKY WHEN?</br>  <br>Bout a week ago.<br><br>You missed it. It was glorious.</br></br></br>  <br>Where have you been man? On a boat perhaps?</br>  Berserk adaptation by Kyoani when?   Russian translations out <br> know Russian <br> stubborn about reading it in English </br></br>  <br>Are you actually fucking retarded?</br>  <br>It's just a dumb theory that Guts mother was a human but his father was not, some people say that Zodd is his father and he is half apostle.<br><br><br>Go back to your cliche shounen where every MC is half human half whatever</br></br></br></br>  <br>De-Loused in the Comatorium by the mars volta<br><br>The feels are real, I've been putting off rereading since about 09.

If guts was some special snowflake half apostate it'd just undermine everything he's achieved imho.</br>  <br>14 years in total.<br>8 on the boat.</br></br>  <br>What on earth are you talking about?<br>What was 14 years?</br></br>  <br><br>If that were the case, wouldn't he be infatuated with Griffith and follow him to his new kingdom like all the other apostles?

They should play up Griffith and Guts' relationship as much as they possibly can. They have some sort of weird bond, each is the other's reason for going on, even if it's driven by hatred.</br>  <br>There's no fucking way that guts is gonna stop his determination just because griffith spouts some sophistry, that would totally betray everything his character is about.</br>  <br>I meant like normal with a sort of Berserk twist to it.</br>  <br>I have a feeling in the end Berserk is going to be about finding your own reason for living and realizing what's truly important to you instead of blindly chasing your ambitions. I can definitely see it ending with a humbled Griffith still alive but left with nothing while Guts lays down the sword to live a fulfilling life with Casca. When it comes down to it Guts is going to realize the death of Griffith isn't what he really wants, it's the kind of acceptance and companionship he had when he was with the Band of the Hawk.</br>  <br> Miura actually doing shit <br> Demo actually uploading shit <br>what a time to be alive</br></br></br>  <br>4chan is not real life, bro.

And some Neets with no disposable income won't be enough to keep the boat afloat (pun not intended).<br><br>But, eh, you'll see. I hope I'll eat my words anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure that with many people growing out of it, there will be just as many growing into it so I don't think it will reach the point where it will lose it's popularity.</br>  <br>I want to see guts nurse casca back to her former self.</br>  <br>best case scenario, griffith is returned to his tortured form. no way guts gonna leave a threat like that.<br><br>how about the people that started 30 years ago? there's still readers after they supposedly outgrew it.</br></br></br>  <br>I actually want that, I just started reading Berserk a couple days ago and am caught up now (I had decided a long while ago I'd get to it when they'd get off the legendary boat ride I kept hearing about).

Sorry. <br><br>I know, but i din't want to talk about the other shitload of people that are waiting E-G that I know on FB, various Forum, and IRL [at the Comics Store].<br><br>Also, Berserk is still at the top of the charts every time a new Volume come out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>pluto scored highest with 40-50, pretty sure berserk isn't all that different. what responsibilities really change that much when you're at that point in life?</br>  <br>You end up doing old things like polishing a coffee table and building a book shelf. Or you get into rc helicopters and dedicate all your time to that. You don't have time for this silly stuff anymore.</br>  <br>I feel the composition has changed. Miura must kill some characters quickly or every scene will just be a panorama of figures.</br>  <br>maybe they'll get split up on the island, who knows</br>  <br>stop trying to feel superior because you read slower than a 5th grader</br>  Any theories on where the current Fantasia arc is going?  <br>Well, does Idolmaster have any magic?</br>  <br>0/5 apply yourself.</br>  <br>After Guts killed Gambino, you could see it.</br>  <br>post it?</br>  <br>I need to get myself some sweet scares.</br>  <br>*scars<br>fuck english.</br></br>  <br>BULGE</br>  <br>make more videos you hack.</br>  <br>He released two videos recently mang.</br>   Guts and Casca meet elf king <br> He's some kind of eldritch creature with a badass beard <br> Guts explains everything that's happened <br> "Hold still, I can fix this" <br> Guts assumes he's talking about Casca <br> Falls to his knees crying <br> Suddenly horrendous pain as the berserker armor tears him apart <br> The metal rips off his body, soaking in his blood <br> The armor turns into the Hound <br> "I can do nothing for someone who does not wish to be fixed..." <br> Healing arc where Casca stops being afraid of mellowed out Guts <br> Consensual sex <br> Guts leaves with the Hound to track down Griffith <br> Doesn't realize he brought back her sanity <br> Struggle and Hate team up against Falconia <br><br>You know you want it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How does Guts remain muscular anyway, all he eats is soup in between being debilitated</br>  <br>Japanese always looks like some arabic/hebrew shit when turned to the side or upside down.</br>  <br>Why is Guts so handsome, everything about him screams "I will make you my fuccboi", goddamn i want to suck his cock</br>  How do you think Berserk will end? Will Guts get his revenge? How far from that do you think we are (chapters, not time)?  <br>We are in penultimate arc</br>  <br>source?</br>   guts is off the boat <br> akagi is still doing the same game <br> berserk will never be finished </br></br>  <br>I cant provide source because its kinda old news and i lost it, but the thing is Guts wont be fighting with Griffith, unless he will magically teleport to him, but that will ruin everything. As you know, the endgame for Guts is curing Caska and living with her till their death, so that doesnt come as a surprise, that Berserk is going to be finished soon.</br>    <br><br> Listening to anything but Hirasawa Susumu </br></br>  <br>Berserk and Souls OSTs</br>  <br> tfw my roommate blasted Blood And Guts when I was playing DaS for the first time <br> Now I can't help but associate that song with New Londo <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=MC7<wbr>H1rOU1Gg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>   New PS4 Berserk game <br> It covers everything from post-Eclipse to THE BOAT <br> No new Berserk game comes out until the PS6 </br></br>  <br>Guts is so cute.</br>  <br>Farnese backstory was pretty good</br>  <br>Checked.<br><br>You could even say it was pretty  hot </br></br></br>  <br> is there a new berserk game?</br>  <br>I miss the crazy Farnese.</br>  <br><br>No, just a fantasy. Like seeing Berserk end in your lifetime.</br></br>  Alright, I always put off reading Berserk due to the boat, but now that it's finally over, I want to start reading it.<br><br>Is batoto the best place to download everything up to now, or is there a better site? Which scans should I be looking for? I'm not using a site like &gt;mangafox.</br></br>  <br><br> Three new witch girls meet guts and all have a crush on him,  <br><br> Scherke tries to fight them off the whole time. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Get Dr.Anon scanlations from BakaBT because Hawk scans that cover the first 20 volumes (which are fucking EVERYWHERE when it comes to online reading sites) are a shit.</br>  They're on land again? I don't believe it! I can finally move on with my life...  Fucking E_G site and his fucking down.   Read latest chapter in both Korean and Spanish <br> Begin to remember the DBZ filler episode where Bulma, Krillin and Gohan end up on a fake planet Namek. <br> Read the chapter again <br> Still the same lingering feeling of dread that I'm being led on. <br><br>Why do I keep getting this feeling?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lately this story simple has too many characters. Now even during the Golden Age Miura feel obligated to frame so many secondaries in each panel.</br>  <br>Dude, don't fucking jinx this... I mean, some things are better left unsaid.</br>  Is there a translation yet?  <br>Gotcha, thanks anon.</br>  <br>You do realise that this episode was not present in the manga and was indeed just pointless filler, right?<br><br>I don't think mangas usually do pointless filler, they are not constrained by having to wait for original medium to expand enough to adapt it.</br></br></br>  <br>Cleaners and re-drawers like to go back and make everything solid black lines, which really goes against miura's whole style of art.</br>  <br>There's one in the comments section of  /r/berserk <br><br>  anyway hawk hows your love life? still alone? </br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, I think those solid black lines looked good before.<br><br>Of course I am.</br></br></br>  <br>Like I said before<br><br> remember the DBZ filler episode  <br><br>I am well aware that it's a filler episode, but even writers of original materials employ stalling tactics in order to get over things like writers blocks. I.. I'm just scared that all this is just some big lie.<br><br> Wake up this Christmas <br> "Oh a new chapter of Berserk is out, let me take a quick gander at it" <br> Reads it like my life depends on it <br> Gets to the part of the chapter where the island was a big illusion created by the ghost pirates to finally kill the crew. Or something in a similar fashion <br> Cant cope with life knowing that it was all a sham. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Why haven't you met some lonely weeb yet? Have you ever not been alone? We've literally reached skellig and you're still alone, kek, that's pretty sad.  </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;134085714 <br> Hello Hawk, How long does it take to translate a manga? <br>I'm not an expert, but I don't think that it normally takes days to translate a small chapter like this.<br><br> Sorry for being so rude before, that was uncalled for, and very fucking stupid of my part. <br>I don't remember you being rude. You were pretty nice last time we talked.</br></br></br></br></br>  I sometimes wish Berserk had more of a story and focused on worldbuilding instead of just showing us Guts slashing away at dozens of monsters. It's not that I dislike that, but there's so much unused potential in this, I can't understand why everyone loves it so much beyond the Golden Age arc.  Let the shitposting begin<br><br>Actually, this thread is dead already so who Carés<br>I'm gonna masturbate now</br></br></br>  <br> tfw ignored <br>r u d e <br><br>  what happened to that autistic tane tripfag anyway?  </br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for the advise m8</br>  <br>Every story has a focus. Berserk's focus is Guts' internal and external struggle. Can't have everything.</br>  <br>I enjoyed litening to this back when I read it the first time:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lhi<wbr>JOajNA_E</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Still, with almost 40 volumes you can have more worldbuilding without losing the focus. The amount of action is excessive, and feels a bit repetitive sometimes.</br>  <br>That'd fuel so much abrupt rage it'd go full circle to being almost hilarious.</br>  <br>I think there's been some strong character arcs with Farnese and Conviction arc, but I do miss the Golden Age. Solid structure, tone, a clear and tragic arc, etc, nostalgia, etc.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;134085984 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;134086113 <br>Hmm, okay.<br><br>Mocking my for my celibacy is more rude.<br><br>Don't know what happened to Tane. He just got bored of the threads, I guess.<br><br> The amount of action is excessive, and feels a bit repetitive sometimes. <br>I only started feeling this way after the troll stuff. The armor ruined the fights for me. It's just smashing monsters with the sword. It was better when he was fighting humans and when he had to go tactical against monsters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, the trolls is when I started thinking this too. I really liked his bout against Serpico, because it really showed that fights could be intense without just Guts swinging his sword around.</br>  <br>I think that Schierke's master's info dump and the Idea of Evil (now retconed) episode pretty much explained the metaphysics of Berserk's world.<br><br>I guess more in-depth info about the geography and politics of the Berserk's human world would be nice.</br></br></br>  <br>You probably read it years ago or it just isn't for you. I just can't get the same feeling, it's like the perfect action, fantasy story for me.</br>  <br><br>desu I enjoyed the fight of rickert &amp; gang vs. rakshas, mostly because of this, it wasn't just lol berserk armor, but instead fighting with all kind of tricks and gear.</br></br>  <br> Idea of Evil (now retconed) episode <br>I just read all of Berserk so far over the past few days but I don't remember hearing about this. Was it some chapter that was just plain scrapped soon after being made and isn't part of the comic canon anymore, or?</br></br>  <br>Indeed, I read it 4 years ago, but I have been trying to reread it beyond the Eclipse and it's incredibly hard for me, and I enjoyed it plenty the first time. I guess having read more manga led me to expect things from Berserk that it doesn't really have.</br>  <br>It was a great one for sure, but it's so weird how they just started fighting out of nowhere, and then after the fight kept going on as a team as if nothing happened.<br><br>I wish Miura would do like other popular fantasy authors and draw a map of his world.<br><br>That fight was alright, but for some reason it felt... somehow childish to me.<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;134086633 <br>Take care.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Like what things?</br>  <br>It was chapter in middle of the Eclipse. Before being reborn as Femto, Griffith meets with "God" and is told he's the Chosen One and what is the purpose of his existence.</br>  <br>I don't know. Maybe it's a more focused story? Less filler? Deeper insight into the MC? I feel like Guts' halted development long time ago. It's not really easy to point out what's missing.</br>  <br>  Not mocking, just... impressed. How's a skinny weeb gril not got seventy orbiters already? Last time I posted in these threads (how fucking long has it been, jesus christ) you were emailing some potential qt bfs. I myself got a qt clingy weeb gf since then, it's really been that long on the boat. Fuck. <br><br>So are we going to see Silat's army, Rickerts inventions, Dhaibas familiars, a powered up Guts and Casca, and a magic duo of Schierke and Farnese attack Falconia in the endgame?</br></br></br>  <br> Fuck off with your bullshit, dude. </br>  <br>Are you actually conversing with it? If you were really before 2014 you shouldn't be doing this.</br>  <br>He's probably a /v/irgin. Don't mind him.</br>  <br><br><br>stop bullying me</br></br></br>  So is now the best time to get into Berserk? I heard that where were multiple translations online but which do I go with?  <br>Shut up faggot</br>  <br>no</br>  Hah I delayed starting on the manga for a year or two anyway so jokes on you faggots, I'm getting through it just as they get off the boat, can't even spoil me because i'm outta this thread lol  <br>Fantasia. The world is in a more magical place so things are crisper and rounder.</br>  <br>see </br>  HURRY UP EG  <br>I guess my personality is just shit, so I don't really get along with anyone.</br>  <br>It won't really be that different, you'll just have to read all the Sea Monster shit without breaks, and then wait to see if what's coming is good. Seriously, that's the worst part of the manga, and if I hadn't read through so much time I could have dropped the manga.</br>  <br>Please stop</br>  <br>no<br><br>your harassment is shitting up the thread</br></br></br>  Where the fuck is the goddamn translation? Weve been waiting eons for this. Why the fuck does it take a week for berserk translations to come out?  Episode 9 tomorrow and SL is doing another change, why the fuck this studio can't fucking follow the fucking source? <br><br>Whatever, is gonna be glorious.</br></br>  <br>That was great.</br>   Fuck me <br> &gt;NO I WANT TO MEET YOUR PARENTS FIRST <br><br>Why?</br></br></br>  <br>Because she's royalty. That would be a really bad move if word gets out the princess is literally fucking around.</br>   leading Japan to victory in WW2   <br>Those little bits of style are fantastic.</br>  Tsugumomo thread?<br>Tsugumomo thread?</br>  i'm traslating it to spanish, the only thing that i know it's that the godess on kazuya's house has BIG BOOBS!  new raws?<br>new raws?</br>  <br>A look into the mind of TLs, everyone</br>  <br>Damn he's talented.</br>  Kiriha a best, I will catch up once she comes back.  <br>Soft is best girl</br>  Chapters 83 to 85 fucking when? Even raws would be enough god damnit.  So to get her back all he has to do is cum on each piece of cloth right?  <br>you could cum just from cuddling<br>amazing.</br></br>  <br>somewhere, someone are working on raw for vol 16</br>  <br>Re-read the previous chapters after the twist with the second Azami.<br><br>So isn't the one with the Kanaka's clothes just the latter's younger/violent (or the old god's grudge) with Azami's look? We know it was her that stayed in the city, and the part where she blushed toward Kazumi showed she has affections for him and wasn't just a monster.<br><br>Waiting for more informations I guess. The fact Azami was actually a tsugumomo changes everything about her coming back. That most probably won't happen for Kanaka though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oops, didn't mean to quote.<br><br/></br></br>  <br>Isnt she an amasogi?</br>    <br>She isn't, that was part of the plot twist besides </br>  <br>There is also the thing about her name not having been given yet.<br><br>There is a high possibility Kazuya will get her back to her senses with it.</br></br></br>  <br>As we can see in the second volume, Kazuya used the "true name" thing to force an order on Kiriha. Maybe he'll do that as well to cancel the "kill Kazuya" one.</br>  <br>I love this guy but that's kind of a dumb comparison, since he obviously didn't put much effort or detail in the top panel.</br>  <br><br>Huh, I totally misinterpreted that.<br><br>This may as well confirm that Kazuya's getting one of the two Azamis at least, then.</br></br></br></br>  Is Towel alive again yet?  <br>She's an obi.<br><br>And no. Still in flashbacks.</br></br></br>  <br>Ah, i see<br>I didnt read 80 and 81 yet because i couldnt find it</br></br>  <br>82 came out too. You're late.</br>  cann't wait for 85  http://live.fc2.com/17356889  <br>So im guessing this guy is the one who possessed Kanaka and Azami?</br>  <br> he </br>  <br><br>WAIT<br>why haven't I seen these yet?</br></br></br>  <br>TOO LEWD</br>  <br>First one is an older page from volume 10 I think, second is from chapter 81.</br>  <br><br>My sources don't have them.<br>I'm sorry to ask, but where?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know anon.

Natsume is loved on /a/ because she IS /a/. Nothing is her fault, everything is boring except her, she's a lazy retarded turd. Just like /a/!</br>  I hated her until the moment it was revealed she's a brocon, after that all was forgiven.  I love you Natsumi!  <br>She's great in any entertainment medium.</br>  <br> not liking   all the characters <br>   on NNB </br></br>  Y'all fuckers gon git cut I say    <br>Then why /a/ hate on Umaru?</br>  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>http://bitlasers.com/djt<br><br>Previous Thread:<br/></br></br></br>  <br>An awful one.
