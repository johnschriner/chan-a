That's why keyframes are important.<br><br>That's why you start with still life.</br></br></br></br>  <br>post it</br>  <br> mfw never done life drawings. </br>  <br>Agreed. Generally when you look at an object in a photograph you aren't trying to replicate it perfectly anyways. Hell if you want to do that you're already done just keep the photograph. The idea is to abstract the essence of the object, that's how we can get still, non moving objects at the apex of a motion to give off the illusion of movement. A lot of factors affect this such as line weight, line cadence, weight displacement, muscle definition, lighting, etc. One anon said it earlier that you really have to understand the object you are looking at, and that's the only way to do it. There's no magic "quick fix".</br>  <br>Now's a better time than never!</br>  Spoilers for the final chapter so far<br><br> <br>Shins go to an orphanage with Kabuto<br>Sakura is the bio mom<br>Sasuke head pokes Salad<br>Chouji becomes slim and Chouchou can't believe that's her dad<br>Rai doesn't see a graduation</br></br></br></br></br> </br></br>  <br> Isn't this board supposed <br>naisu inglishu</br></br>   Rai answering literally every question in the thread except "What panels confirm that Sakura is the bio mom if we don't see her giving birth and you can't read Japanese" <br><br>A+ SPOILER PROVIDER</br></br>  <br>I'd legit probably die if Evil made the call and rai fucked up.</br>  <br> Blood relations don't matter <br><br>It's a cheap trick making your character understand that but still making her blood related to the woman who took care of her and she loves/setting up that the dude who abandoned her but is his biological father will still be forgiven and be know as 'dad'.<br><br>The lesson is there for sarada, but for the readers is a big shallow comment.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Evil did take back everything she said about Karin being the mother, but then Rai's spoilers based just on the panels seem to be perfectly in line with what she was saying.

If she is already an adult, is there some of her as a teenager? How has she changed over time? If there isn't such art of her, how do you imagine that she'd change?<br><br>(There is this illustration of Mai after she graduates from school. The main difference seems to be that her eyes are somewhat narrower that before and she looks more serious, which I suppose represents her maturing. Her hair color also looks different, but that may be a stylistic choice for the illustration rather than an actual change in Mai's appearance.)</br></br>  <br>Fuck, there's quite the number of continuities, but I think they all connect in some way, not too sure about that.
