[ They are both equally hot. One of them might be silk hiding steel while the other one's going to be into collars and some freaky shit  Subs where  I want to kill this fucking cunt.    Subs never ever.   Iroha is better.<br/>        Reminder that Kaioh is a loser who has nothing better to do than fuck with high school students  It's over. Where should I shitpost now?  Does yukino even have 8man's number yet?    Please, Yuimom by a mile.  Yuimom is so best that she beats Yukino by herself.       No, she's to autistic to ask.    It doesn't take much to be better than Yukino.     No one.  Hayama witnesses what Hachiman and the service club accomplish together and the esteem Haruno shows them and feels envious. He decides he hasn't been living his life the way he truly wants to and breaks from Haruno and his family to go his own way, committing himself to be sincere for once.  Either that or he just fades into the background like he always does when the story stops being about him and we never really know.        Yahari Girl Power Rankings:  1. Sensei 2. Orimoto 3. Haruno 4. Shiromeguri 5. Komachi 6. Rumi 7. Saki 8. Iroha 9. Yui 10. Sagami 11. Yukino 12. Ebina 13. Miura                 stop     It doesn't take much to squish a bug, but that doesn't mean a BMW isn't completely superior to a Ford.    Was war declared?   Honestly though, 8man should pick Yui. She is the best by far, needs no explanation.   Yukino would take rejection from 8man the best too.       I read that as "Yurimom". Posting yurimom.     best by far  subjective      It's open season for hunting 8mans right now.  But I don't think it's really going to be a 'war'. We're not going to get true harem-style competition from the girls.      Y U I U I     mfw Yuidad is really post awakened 8man   mfw Yuimom broke him down with kindness   mfw he sets 8man right   mfw he did right      SUBS WHEN?   What if this anime ends wih a cliffhanger and an entire new season is announced for the next year?    I don't think there will be a hot war either, I think there might be a cold war and tension but it will be on the back burner to the plot. We still have to deal with Yukinon's fucked head and 8man's allergy to pussy.    What season within a year Watari would only be able to pump out 2 volumes at best.     What would they animate? Probably vol 12 will be out by then. I guess it's possible a theoretical vol 13 would be out by the time the anime ends.  But two volumes isn't much to go on considering how many volumes previous seasons have covered.       Now that's alpha.   Okay people still arent sure  Is Yui a part of Sensei Contest or no?  I dont think she is       Get watari to work 140 hours per week.   translation when?   Obviously not. it is only a forced conflict    Who's that?     Yukino would take rejection from 8man the best too.  This, Yukino would barely feel a rejection from 8man. She was ready to happily agree to no romance. Yui would be very hurt though.       I'm sure if Yui asked to join it she could. Doesn't she ask at some point during the student council event? I might be imagining that.  Regardless I don't see her winning it whether she gets to technically be a part of it or not. It's a Yukino/Hachiman race.       Is this even good     Yui would be very hurt   Literally sinking her own ship      the main girl in Watari's new LN.    Sensei wouldn't have graded her if she wasn't.    Yukino &gt; Yui therefore Yukino's mom &gt; Yui's mom    Nice cum coaxer here, also nice quads      Looks nothing like Yukinoshita.    0. Hachiman    Rewatch the scene, it was really painful for her to try and sink it. 8man saved it though.    No Sensei just mentioned her in passing when Yukino asked sensei who was winning (between her and Hachiman)  Still, its going to be between Yuki and Hachi as you mentioned   Pretty sure this Vol 11 Yuki would take rejection incredibly hard   Yui would get hurt, cry, but probably move on if she did get rejected. I think Yukino would be devastated honestly          Being Yukino is suffering, watching this episode make me realize Yui suffering is nothing    Damn, she grew up fast.     Doesn't change the fact that she's planning on sinking herself    Missing the hair ribbons and has bigger tits     Yukino would take rejection from 8man the best too.  Did you watch last episode? She was willing to take Yui's choice out of fear. Considering how much of a mess she is right now, a rejection would make her even worse.  Yui would definitely be hurt too, but unlike Yukino, she's well-adjusted. She's likely to overcome a rejection given enough time.        She literally says she knew that 8man wouldn't let her and felt satisfied by it.    I think Yukino would be devastated honestly  Why do you think that?        Rumi confirm    She's been suffering more than Yui has since Vol 6 or so. Yui's only suffering (so far) is that she isnt with Hikki and seeing her friends suffer  Yuki's suffering is what Yui goes through but with family and emotional issues  Was she really sad as fuck in the LN when she couldnt even muster the courage to give Hachiman her homemade goods?         happily agree  Were you even watching? She'll feel like shit but say and do nothing unless someone puts up a teleprompter.     Yui would be hurt but could easily move on, as she is actually emotionally healthy. Yukino is so emotionally fragile that the only thing she could possibly continue living with would be total ambiguity as it is now. Actual rejection would destroy her, since what relationships we see now are all she has.    That's the flattest ass I've seen. I think I even became a bit depressed after seeing it.  Whoever drew that should have been told to go back, and redraw that ass until it was nice and round as God commands it.       No, because the subs aren't out yet.     Speaking only one language    Kek anon       not liking flat everything  what are you, gay?     Unlike Yui's, Yukino's suffering is entirely on her.    No, I'm not your dad.    You actually waste time you could spend watching anime on learning Japanese? I'd make fun of you but you've already done that better than I ever could.     has bigger tits  that single detail makes all the difference     Not really, in Yukino's case is on her family. Though she could just stand up to them, given how she grew up that isn't as easy.  On the other hand, all Yui has to do is fucking confess.        Soulless bitch over 11/10 comfy MILF  I mean I can respect preferring Yukino over Yui but you're just trying to start shit, aren't you?     She's incredibly emotionally fragile right now; well she's always been since before the series began but she just hid herself behind the ice wall.   Hachiman I think is something of a special existence for her; I mean he's the only guy we've seen that can support her (likewise with Yui for girls), can understand her to some degree. Hayama failed her. Hachiman has yet to do so and often the one who aids her the most (he basically broke through the ice wall that she had when he went all genuine). She only goes full dere around Hachiman (before she would have minded but she doesnt anymore)  Anyways, its obvious she likes him and getting rejected by him would crush her. Yui can deal with emotions easily (its the point of her entire character),         Yukino would be devastated  She's a walking steaming pile of psychological mess. Dependency issues, family issues, and recently has conflicted relationship with the only 2 person she can trust. I'm not surprised if she can't learn to love after rejected.     Do we know anything about either mothers other than their combined 12 lines?    Her dependency issues and getting bullied in school can't be blamed on Yukinomom or Haruno.     I think it's going to be 'order' but more like something sweet that will make us go awww. What the order is exactly will depend on the situation at the end. If they are friends, it could be for contact info (since we're 11 volumes in and they still haven't exchanged it, it makes you think that's being withheld for a special moment). Or just acknowledge as friends (if Hachiman wins) because he's been refused twice now. If they're lovers or otherwise on a romance path it could be something sweet along those lines.    What was the talk in the end in the episode about?  Sounded like Yuigahama was forcing Yukinos hand on something and 8man interrupted before a mistake was made.  I didn't understand most of the dialogue but my heart was still tight during the whole episode.       DESTROOOOOOOOOOOOOOYED   Well Yukinoshita never tells lies (as Hachiman knows) and she told him that they can never be friends  Doesnt mean that they cant be boy/girlfriends i the end though. I mean its pretty sweet and incredibly cheesy but I think Watari would do something like that     68 / 9 / 33  We need more Image, pls anons.  i-irohasu <br/>      dependency issues  Those stem from being sheltered or not being taught independence as a child, which is a duty of the parents. Her getting bullied at school was likely a result of the inability of her parents to teach her how to mesh with the crowd or defend herself. You can't blame children for not knowing how to do things their parents neglect to teach them. Children only independently learn through simple negative and positive stimuli, and so such complex concepts must be actively taught.    where the fuck r the subs    The vol 11 spoilers posted are that Yui proposes that the service club all stay like they are now forever, essentially removing romance from the picture. Basically pretend like they don't feel anything for Hachiman. Yukino, since she was dependency mode was starting to accept Yui, but Hachiman interrupted and gave another 'genuine' speech along with saying Yukino had to solve her own problems and Yui had to be genuine. He rejected that sort of superficiality with people "important" to him.      Honestly though, I still think that an eventual loss is better for Yukino, partly because as you guys point out, she's so fragile emotionally right now.  Once 8man and Yui help her get on her own path, it'll be a hallmark that she can take the bad with the good, while Yui's victory will be a form of positive reinforcement for her going out on a limb and chasing what she wants.       don't know, but apparently it spends most of the LN being a romcom and then at the end aliens or something invade   If you listen to the entire OP (Harumodoki), there's a part at the end with the lyrics "yuki no shita."  raw where?   How is this?    She was overseas when the bullying occured right? Elementary school or something and Hayama never really helped her out right?   We still need more of Yuki's past I think; we've gotten hints over the novels but its just bits and pieces      Irohasu to you, brother.    confirming her being a SHITA ah i see what ur getting at     Does that mean Americans are the ones who bullied Yukino?     Are you that same guy who keeps spouting positive reinforcement as if Oregairu is some sort of skinner box experiment?  Isnt Yukinoshita also starting to chase after him too though?     Good Irohasu, anons.  What's the state of things? Memesubs when?      Once 8man and Yui help her get on her own path, it'll be a hallmark that she can take the bad with the good, while Yui's victory will be a form of positive reinforcement for her going out on a limb and chasing what she wants.  The thing is though, that the average person isn't this strong, much less the gesticulating puddle of emotional quicksilver that is Yukino. People who aren't strong by adolescence are unlikely to become so as they grow up, and are more likely to become emotionally dependent adults. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with that, but such people require more emotional support to remain as emotionally healthy. Yukino would probably never recover from losing the 8bowl.    Good Irohasu, everyone!   Her backstory is this as far as I can tell   be super good at school, but not get exposed to the same kind of public-facing stuff as Haruno so never learn to deal with them   other kids are envious, she asks her sister/parents how to deal with it, her parents tell her she's just superior to them and to ignore them, her sister eggs her on   she becomes ronery and isolated   gets into a love triangle with herself, haruno, and hayato at some point   haruno wins, but when hayato tries to do something she tells them she was just fucking with them   this creates the awkwardness hayato has around haruno and yukino   this also makes yukino put up the icewall so she's never hurt like that again   its the only real logical explanation of why she has such this vicious hate for her sister and why the rumor of yukino-hayato was distasteful to them              It looks like a Yukinoshita that is not shit.    I see, thanks anon. Subs can't come soon enough.  I wish there was some anime I could binge watch for me to be able to understand shit well enough, I really need to get on with it since I learned english by listening to music and watching subbed TV series.       She is a shita, but she'll win the 8manbowl.    Where my Yuibros at?   ;_;       Needing more is an understatement. Her problems are so incredibly vague that people have the creative freedom to twist and bend them to whatever fits their shitposting needs.  I just want clarification which I hope we were getting in this volume but nope, Watari is pushing answers back another 6 months.  Pic related, it's Watari and his editors.         Good Irohasu   Do any of you have any idea how stupid you sound?    So glad Iroha was nowhere to be seen    People actually think she has a chance  Are you guys fucking retarded?     S3 never?   Fuck you and your pic.   My neighbour just told be to shut the fuck up as I was laughing really hard at it.      One thing I noticed is that all the major characters in the story have experienced romantic rejection except for Yui (that we know of). And all of them responded to that rejection differently.  1. Hachiman has plenty of times. He has not handled it well obviously. But he has been learning a new perspective on it throughout the story for instance by gradually overcoming his hostility to 'nice girls'. And he's made peace with Orimoto.  2. Yukino did in the past with Hayato. She responded by, well, you can see. It was not mature reaction. But we see in vol 10 that she was starting to forgive Hayato for it. Albeit she was developing another problem at the same time.   3. Iroha did with Hayato as well. She instantly seems to have transferred her affections to Hachiman. Hayato remarked that her affections were "probably not for me" which suggests that Iroha has handled it by considering her true feelings. Not a bad response but it remains to be seen. At any rate, she doesn't have a hostile attitude towards Hayato for sure.  I really feel like being able to handle rejection in a mature way is one of the things the story is about. So it may be coming for Yui.           I don't know about that. I was just reiterating that Yukino's problems are not on her, as the anon I replied to asserted. I can't really answer your question. Have a new smug face instead.    We've earn enough points. Her saliva is love potion, it'll work in Vol12     not being taught independence as a child  You learn to be independent on your own. That's the fucking point. You also do not have to be "taught" how to make friends unless you're literally autistic, in which case it would be the responsibility of the parents to teach you basic social skills.     yfw we get a movie instead of an OVA   So is it going to be Toradora all over again with Yui giving Yukino up to the 8inches?    That strikes my sides as a dangerous activity.     fuuuuuuuuuck.    Yeah, but the difference is that Minori was a cunt.    Irohasu~     Tfw Watari is gonna make a shit ending    I'm worried       Why would I want to see an hour and a half of shitting on Yui when I can just have 30 minutes?    Are subs out yet?   yes right now    If we don't get an ova for the date with iroha I'm going to eat my own shit.     Thanks for signing up for Pan-san Facts!

Yukimom is obviously the overbearing tiger mom type, and Yui's mom is the normal housewife type. Other than that no.    you liar!    Not him, but this is where it's from.    kek I'm pretty sure if he text her 'I love you' the spam stops      Yuimom is a domestic goddess.      Is there something you can eat to maybe flavor your shit a little better?  It wouldn't hurt you plan ahead a bit.       Irohasu~~~~~  We're every where anon.  Atleast our goddess has her move on 8man with spoon feeding and a half romantic answer! Where're your girls at? still finding your honmono or still trying to beg 8man fix your trouble? Saliva &gt;cookies = chocolate       Well I'd say she did have a part the problems (her reaction to what happened) but I'm not going to fault her for it  I mean both 8man and Yukino put up walls and was mostly independent up until the series began. The big difference is that while 8man had loner problems because of his stance on girls, he was still an emotionally secure dude; having Komachi around helped too  Yuki put up walls but inside shw was pretty frail and she didnt have any support structure until Hachiman and Yui came along        Subs any minute now.       You learn to be independent on your own.  You underestimate the influence of parents on a child's growth, particularly one who is not naturally gregarious. That aside, the whole point of the traditional family structure throughout history has been to have the children be taught how to function correctly in society by their parents. Humanity is not some global do-as-you-please anarchy where there are no social rules. If the individual child is not taught to function by their parents, they will likely learn from their friends who were. Yukino's situation arises when a child with irresponsible parents is not naturally adept at communication, is put into situations where companionship is not easily come by, or has some antisocial notion reinforced by external stimuli. All three of these apply to Yukino, making her situation particularly severe, much more than the average "loner kid" or "guy who doesn't have many friends."     8man denied her about 3 times now nice girl speech, StuCo, and now her proposal.   Nothing happened this episode.    fuxk  What?      That's not really the same as the others experienced though.    Yukimom is a manipulator.  Yukino is just a nice soft quiet lady who loves kitties and pan-san underneath an icy shield.     you will never have two female friends fight over you     lady   Shes how old 16? 17? Not a lady.       nice girl speech  Refusing/Confirming her sencerity  Proposal  She knew it was going to happen       My nigga.     chasing what she wants.  She doesn't need to get everything she wants. She has perfect life Yui victory is way too shallow you think, it is so easy route.    Let her take the bad with the good  So lets her create another ice wall again          i'm not sure what it tastes like but eaten oats for an entire day and your shit will smell exactly like oats, i'm dead serious    Eguchi's voice has changed a lot since S1 I've noticed. He has much wider range now   Thank god   I want to give Yukino a pet parrot and listen to her repeat the same lines over and over.  Eventually all this sexual tension will reach a breaking point.   meant to reply to<br/>     overbearing tiger   bear tiger   bearcat   Yukino is just a spoiled brat and can't admit she loves her mom the most        Extreme fucking.   It's 1 AM lads  Where are the subs     Nope,  in the vol.11 LN 8man's monologue heavily implied that he still want to fulfill his promised date with Yui.  In the final volume, Yui will give up and try to run away from the club. After 8man realized Yui's feeling is the most genuine thing, he will chase after Yui.  This time he won’t wait, but he’ll go instead.            nyaa~  nyaa~  nyaa~  nyaa~  nyaa~  nyaa~  nyaa~  nyaa~           A lady is a classy gal. While lady may more often refer to an older woman, it doesnt mean a teenager cannot be a lady.    its 3pm where r the subs     When I fuck Camilla.    If they meant that much to you and you knew that picking one would really hurt the other I think it would be an awful thing to be in. If they were best friends you could fundamentally alter their relationship for the worse and there would be no way around the emotional trauma.   I would hate it and probably crawl into a hole if it happened to me.     5 hours  GO TO BED       USE CREDIT BITCH  No seriously who the fuck uses cash nowadays       He's alpha as fuck. Super emo alpha.    Wanting to fuck your own sister, you are a sick man.    She'd be the perfect wife for an anon too. Dutiful and careful, with plenty of banter, and she has her own quiet hobbies that she can silently enjoy as anon watches his cartoons. Hell, with the advent of the electronic headphone she can do it sitting in his lap and be unbothered.    Well that date is basically going to be where he either gets with Yui or in the end gets with Yukinoshita after Hachiman gave them the green light to wage war for him this volume  I think everyone knew that a real 1 on 1 date where he has to deal with Yui's feelings in some fashion was going to happen      subs never    I'd say a few more hours. Go shitpost some more.   THE WORLD CALLS FOR MEME SUBS, AND COMMIE ANSWERS  NO CAMILLA HYPE POSTS  NO WAITING UNTIL TOMORROW       Nobody cares what you would do. Don't worry about 8man though. He's too weak to ever make a decision and will probably just silently go off to college never to see either of them again.    We are trying to build to the point where losing 8man to Yui would not hurt Yukino. I think we will get there since Yukino isn't actually in love with 8man.    That can;t be real    Anything is fine if we get to see the ending   I'm sure it'll happen though, Yahari is pretty popular.      8man ditched Yui while she was looking at the penguins to fingerfuck Yukino    Yukino is too weak-willed and complacent to be manipulative.     No seriously who the fuck uses cash nowadays  Cash and debit cards are used by responsible people who don't spend money that they don't have and would prefer not to pay extra fees for doing so.     SYDNEY REPRESENT!   God I hate all this suffering. When is this going to end?   Gotta fill it up with dank memes before releasing.    I pay off my credit bill every month, pay 0 in fees, and get 2% back on all purchases through credit.   Why was Yukino making this face?  Was she afraid of Yui and couldn't go against her force?  Was the idea of throwing her love for 8man away that awful to her but she couldn't put it in words? Was she afraid that 8man may end up rejecting her so she would rather have the status quo than to lose everything?       this is the last episode    WA here. Thanks for being the cancer that is destroying the once-proud nation of Australia.   what was your favorite part of this season?  mine was when we got to see saki cry from the haunted house  something just rings inside me when I see a good girl suffer       I like rewards programs that I get; also I get interest by storing money in my account and only paying the bills when I actually need to     Was in the livewatch. Can't wait for Spyro now. I want to know what happened when Yukino left the two in the penguin attraction.  Also  Camilla  What happened?       It's 7 AM.  SUBS WHERE      Hopefully it's the last ever    You also get to hear yourself twice every time you talk to her.    Iroha marriage episode?    two whole seasons   Yet I still have to ask how the fuck are Yui and Yukino friends exactly?  They have literally no chemistry and nothing in common.        I didn't say such people only use cash and debit. I simply answered the question of "who uses cash anymore?" Good on you, anons.    Will Hayama fuck his crush Y?   I was replying to   That would be too weak of 8man. After telling everyone to be genuine they are more likely to act on their feelings so it is either rejection or acceptance.       WA here  Whats it like being in the backwater of Australia in the middle of nowhere?  Granted you probably don't have shitskins invading the place.       No, he is a cuck.    Gentlemen, it was a privilege watching with you.  What's the next series to follow with /a/ and shitpost endlessly about?      Shut the fuck up skiddiks   Is Hachiman actually Pan-San? Is that symbolism actually true     Yahari season 3     After Spyro finishes Yahari, we go to Watari's new work.     I think Yahari threads = best place for shitposting. Or you can try waifu war in Lovelife threads.    I sorta understand the friendship, since I have a friend like that. I don't even understand how it works.     b-but im from melbourne not sydney  inb4 hipster fgt       He doesn't deserve Yumiko. She's too good for such an edgy, indecisive little bitch like him.  She needs someone more genuine than that.     Does this mean war?    Yukino isn't actually in love with 8man     This     Yui turns down date    8man moves onto Yukino's date    Goes full genuine does and says all the things he wanted    Okay date, negative development    Yui decides to take him up on his offer    8man goes full genuine again    More negative development    The girls aren't sure whether they want to pursue him anymore.    8man slowly fades away from the club without anyone batting an eyelash.     He's now free to hangout with Saika, Saki, Komachi, and Shizuka in his third year.    Iroha can no longer use the club as an excuse to spend time with 8man.    She uses Komachi as a tool to entrap him.   Haruno has already dug her fingers into Komachi under the guise of being a helpful onee-san to guide her to success.   Love triangle 2: Electric Boogaloo.                               We real men have been forced into the corner that is WA by your inconsideration for the health of your own country. Don't blame us for escaping from what you were too complacent to stop.  I've never even been to Australia.      You can always shitpost in threads about when chapters of the LN get translated.    Was it rape?    Is this going to be a sequel to Yahari in some way?     notHaruno   notHachiman   notYukino   BRAVO WATARI        It started that way, but by the end it wasn't.

It's Watari's new work  MC is literally 8man apparently     How could Yui screw over Yukino and 8inches genuine love like that?   It's like Yahari, but this time Yukino is the boy and Hachiman is the girl!      those obviously rehashed characters   H A C K A C K          He could certainly try but it would become consensual lovemaking for the sole purpose of procreation as soon as they locked eyes.    LN authors are all hacks. Every new novel is the same rehashed story.   Yukimom is a bitch. Yuimom has sweater puppies.     context?     Hope they get catchy songs again  ED1 of Evol was quite good I felt       Aquarion  Shit, I downloaded both Evol and Genesis because of that one 4chan banner but haven't watched either. Is it worth the time sink?    8man doesn't care about Yui. He doesn't love her.   She was waiting for her cue. 8man wasn't talking so she crashed.    Do you think she'll offer pity sex to 8man?    She is misinterpreting her dependency and respect for him as romantic love. If he got together with Yui she would realize it and not feel down. I don't think Yukino is in love with 8man.    She is a good girl and wanted to help her friend. She was under the impression that Yukino and 8man loved each other so she tried not to be a bother and supported them.       Did yukino have romantic feelings for the 8inches during the culture festival? I think 8man might have had feelings for Yukino at the time ("You don't need to bee more like your sister, you're fine the way you are" or whatever he said), but I Yukino was really still warming up to him, perhaps at an accelerated rate after he made his first sacrifice.    Yui kept reaching out to Yukino while Yukino does nothing in return.  In the final arc I expect Yukino will finally do something to help her friend.  thus the  Yukino tied her good luck slip with Yui's bad luck slip so it even out and both got small luck.  foreshadowing.           After 8man realized Yui's feeling is the most genuine thing,   Why do Yuifags still fail to understand is that "hon mono" isn't about "genuine feeling" or "who is more genuine"  It's not some painting or jewelry you must acquire as all cost because it something "genuine"         I was pushed with one final shove. The impact caused Yukinoshita and me to be forced into the trolley, and we almost fell on top of each other.   With my last stand of resistance, I was somehow able to avoid crashing into Yukinoshita, but we were put into a cramped position.   …She’s so close, she’s so close. Yukinoshita and I scooted over to opposite ends of the narrow trolley.      1:24 AM here. Should I go to bed or wait for subs?    8man doesn't care about Yui. He doesn't love her in the anime.   FTFY      Go to sleep     Is it worth the time sink?   the first series is pretty good. Evol starts strong but ends in pure fury inducing shit.       She is misinterpreting her dependency and respect for him as romantic love     Season 3 then the specials followed by the ending OVAs.   SUBS ARE OUT!!!!!!!! FINALLY!  So, subs tomorrow?   frog is talking some dick up his ass so it will take time    She'll try, and fail miserably.    Do you even watch this episode or you just a denial yuifags?      It's not some painting or jewelry you must acquire as all cost because it something "genuine"   Not that guy but with 8man, he wants to 'see' it. Which means he wants others to be genuine.         being racist  mods, delete this white man     Its legit. Fucking finally.    Oh shit it's real.    Watari and Sagara sou (Hentai Ouji) work on it.  And watari still show no interested in girl. He go to hotspring with Sagara, leave Eguichi home.  Why, you ask? It sure ain’t good for two young guys to be under one roof. This guy had no inhibitions…   I should’ve given him a piece of my mind, seeing as we were in the same room and we’d end up stuck together in the futons they laid out after dinner.   And the result of all of this was Qualidea   So no girl end, friendship end confirmed once again             No more Akino anon, love is over.    I don't know about Genesis, I just started watching EVOL after episode 8 for best girl and then joined in the shitposting. And then suffering.  Come to think of it, I don't know if EVOL is worth it either.           She was attracted to him on some level and started falling for him around vol 3, when vol 6 came around I think she did unknowingly. Genuine might have been bad for her, before genuine she was falling out of love but after that she turned into what we see now.   Subs in 5 mins according to IRC   T H I G H - -I - G - H - S         http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=4<wbr>49243</wbr>     Maybe? I think students in her class did ask about her relationship with Hachiman though because Vol 6 (heavily implied in the LN)  By genuine scene, yeah she definitely did.    Yukino helped Yui a lot in the beginning fo the series; Yui's early issues had to do with her trying to fit in and not be herself but being the club with Hachiman and Yukinon, allowed her to express herself more.         Everytime commie has made an ebin joke excuse the subs came out on Friday. Everytime they didn't say jack shit they came out Thursday. Because there's an ebin joke on their page right now I'd assume it's not happening.     IT BEGINS   Is 8man a boobs man or a DFC man?    Yukino tied her good luck slip with Yui's bad luck slip so it even out and both got small luck.  Wait what was this?        That's not funny. You're not funny. Cut it out and take a fucking seat, anon.     I wonder how many stupid people there are that will believe this.     does nothing in return  What? She always dotes on her.     yeah no    I watched it. Why would this make me in denial? People don't usually call me that unless I am shitting on Irohafags.   It's true, I haven't seen good evidence that Yukino loves 8man for real.       This happened when I was 14. Neither worked out though. Feels bad man.     480p   the fuck man  what the actual fuck        KITAAAAAAA~~~ http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>04195  Based FFF saving us from memesubs.  </wbr>      I don't know if EVOL is worth it either.   Zessica ends the series alone and dead inside, no one caring that she's alive or that she seemingly sacrificed herself to save Amata. Instead everyone focuses on how special awesome Mikono is and if you don't like Mikono you can die      Shrine scene in Vol 10   In 10.5 Ch 3, I think he shows is a boob man. He kept on monologuing about Yukino's lack of a chest several times      OKAY  TIME FOR FALSE FLAGS    Are we back on april and I didn't notice?    Sorry anon but that's a trick you can only do once, and Commie already blew it.     04   Jesus fucking christ       Come to think of it anon your probably shouldn't look at     Yeah... yeah...         I dunno, but I haven't seen him staring at a flat chest and blushing.      Akino is gone   Fuck me.She had some really good OP/ED's for aquarion.       Shrine scene in Vol 10  chapter?     Don't you see she wants to give 8man chocolate this episode?    What is this?    This is going the way of haganai. Interest or no they don't have enough material to push out another cour.    Zessica didn't truly love Amata to begin with. She is much better off without him.   The ride is over. The dream is over.  Now it's time to pray for vol.10,5 OVA.      vol. 10   Yukino: Good Luck &gt; Small Luck   Yui: Excellent Luck &gt; Bad Luck &gt; Small Luck   8man: Small Luck   Definitely a foreshadowing.         <br/>   She wants to give him choco out of her THINKING she is in love with him. She didn't though, she had the opportunities but didn't use them.   Where are you my fellow necromancers and liches? Normal skeletons are welcome too.  We ride together.    I have serious umbrage with Haruno's BS last week.  Yeah they weren't being totally sincere with their Valentine's event but I don't think that's bad given all the progress they've made. It's not right to expect too much out of them at once, even if they aren't being genuine.    https://kyakka.wordpress.com/2015/0<wbr>6/25/yahari-light-novel-volume-a-pr<wbr>ologue-1/  How can one man be so based?  </wbr></wbr>   the fuck is with the pink hair    Watari's new LN collab featuring   NotYukino   Not8man   Not Haruno   NotKomachi   NotSensei    Seems like Not8man and NotHaruno are siblings while NotYukino and NotKomachi are sisters. They even get a NotHiratsuka who cares for them! Is there no Yui equivalent here              She didn't though, she had the opportunities but didn't use them  Bloody hell you really never experience love haven't you     NOT KNOWING QUALIDEA  GET OUT REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE     Near the start. 1 or 2.    It means that Yui will win the 8man     Amata was a piece of shit anyways, she can do better.   Fixed that for you. And no one's really mad that she lost but for fucks sake at least show some sign that you care that she's fucking alive people.  There's losing and then there's the universe bending backwards to fuck you over        Of course he's experienced love. He's watched over 300 romcom animes.    She is autistic anon, she is so passive about that kind of thing      On my cellphone. Don't have any skelty pics right now.      Is there no Yui equivalent here    Watari compensates for Yui winning Yahari    All according to plan.         No, I have not. Explain to me why she didn't give it to him during the opportunities she was given. She doesn't fear his rejection from the evidence we have seen.    Then she isn't in love. I wonder why she even made the chocolate if she was going to wig out.         Synopsis said he wants to find a girl, maybe that girl    Based     because emotions are complicated and scary     Not everybody is as socially unaware as you are. In fact, plenty of people are quite shy. Teenagers even more so.    Volume a?    there no Yui equivalent here  Guess he learned his lesson.  Will NotIroha appear and steal the show in the later volumes?         Thanks     maybe that girl   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Zoh<wbr>1LGADKI8</wbr>  [ ]      I'VE RETURNED FROM THE NIGHTMARE REALMS FOR THE SUBS    From my experience they are straight forward. When I am sad I say I am. When I am mad I say I am mad.    But if she actually loved him she should be able to overcome that.       She is definitely talking about Yukino and Hachiman together I think    There are other things I find important, but lumped together, you could say they were necessary   What I want and what they want are so similar, yet why are they so different   It doesn’t have to be right because I want to take those hands           cooperates with Haruma to find a girl student...?      I'm already mining google images.     Quite the good bait you have there matey 8/10 keep going     Iroha invited Haruno to the v-day event for no reason other than get the final arc rolling, she's got nothing going for her anymore. If she did get rejected in that spoon scene (unlikely but still), she'll show up on a single chapter next volume and that's it.  And people said watari wasn't a hack and a lazy cunt.          They are "complicated" because people are afraid of being judged for their genuine feelings.      But if she actually loved him she should be able to overcome that.  You said you have never been in love. How would you know that?   From my experience they are straight forward. When I am sad I say I am. When I am mad I say I am mad.  That isn't normal. Most people hide behind a facade to maintain appearances with friends and family and professionalism at work. You might be autistic.        Holy shit Yui has some serious self-esteem issues.  I mean I know she isn't some top of the class genius but that's no reason to constantly call yourself stupid.      Her new target to depend on and emulate is Yui. She's somewhat aware of it and was shocked how she's playing dirty like her. Yukino doesn't really like 8man, she's just confused and believes her feelings for 8man are like Yui's.       my experience  ayy lmao  a y y  l m a o             https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-a/prologue-1/ This is Yui, right? </wbr>   This show works so much better when you the first season with real attention to the dialogue, the go watch S2 in aired reverse order from the latest episode.  Everything makes more sense with 8man grand stating and the characters interactions and what they imply behind it all.     NotYukino has Iroha personalities    Apart from  You might be autistic  he's kind of spot on        If anything, they got worse. Yui got better this episode but was cucking herself last week. Yukino is still completely out of touch with herself. She is literally parroting Hachiman. Haruno has good reason to be aggressive.    Yui further solidified as not genuine.  Disgusting.      Pure unabashed blatant shitpost    What volume is this?     Haruno has good reason to be aggressive.   She's not wrong, but she's not helping matters either. All she did was see a building on fire and toss on some gasoline instead of calling the fire department     Correct me if I wrong, didn't yukinon studied in US before? Why she said "excuse" that way? Referring to ep 12 tho   Even better. He truly learned his lesson.   This means Irohasu doesn't win here ;_;       There's a Firehouse subs near where I'm moving to. Are they good or should I stick to Jimmy Johns and Potbelly?     How would you know that?  Love is like any other emotion.    That isn't normal.  It is to me, how you handle yourself is normal to you. I don't think of people's emotions unless they are stated and I don't intend on mine being known until I state them.   That might be true too, she is just copying Yui's love of 8man.   Well meme'd friend              and now you're on /a/. your life really went down hill, huh?    Am I the only person who finds Subway better than Jimmy Johns?   false flagging intensified   reading 2ch   mfw Iroha is gone for good this time      i want lies     Firehouse is pretty good; never had Potbelly. I'd say theyre better than JJ's.     Why she said "excuse" that way? Referring to ep 12 tho   Just because she went to america doesn't mean the writer did      She's supposed to be a returnee I think? Or is she just in the class for international studies just because?   twf no arc where Yukino's male american friend comes to visit, 8man feels threatened but the guy turned out to be gay.      This episode. Yui deserves a million praise for her bravery, kindness and determination to break the status quo. It really showed how much she cared about 8man and Yukinon. How much she was ready for everything to go wrong and a risk to lost something she holds dear. And how her hands trembling when giving 8man the cookies, and her trembling legs when making the proposal are just delicious. Now, if only Toyama could give her the trembling and heavy voice, it would be a gold.    Yeah. I feel for her.     feels good man    I might just sleep and watch tomorrow ;-;    I live close to a potbelly and fhs. Never been but I found $200's yesterday  I don't work tomorrow. I will go to one of those after subs are out I sleep.      remove yuifags  I will buy 10 copies of this shit if Gahamama wins.   There is no fire department, and they're the only ones that can get themselves out of that mess. Haruno is trying to snap them out of the illusion they're creating before it gets worse. Haruno was right.     Holy shit Yui has some serious self-esteem issues.   I mean I know she isn't some top of the class genius but that's no reason to constantly call yourself stupid.   That’s often the case with people who are cheeky and genki on the outside.  They’re masking the deep insecurities and other issues that they don’t want showing.  Its also often why a lot of comedians go through massive depression and commit suicide.  Source wa ore   I just want to comfort Yui ;_;                Are you samefagging?       11, anon.     Probably because I was a shut-in that played mmo and read manga and they were normals 13 years ago. Still talk to one and she says it's impossible between us.     yui gets rejected by 8man   cries about it, talks to mother   mother goes to talk to 8man   8man ntrs yui with her mom at her house   ntr end   would buy         This is my fetish   So she wanted ungenuineness for what purpose?    Wait before you get out of school and have to work to feed your stomach.  It's easy to saying something about thing you haven't experience with.       NotYukino has Iroha personalities  Picked the fuck up   inb4 it isn't translated yet       FUCKING COMMIE CUCKS  SUBS NOW     10/10 would buy 20 copies     That might be true too, she is just copying Yui's love of 8man.  I honestly can't get a read on Yukino anymore after this episode. What the hell, Watari?       What a cop-out, this only serves to confirm watari is a pleb who doesn't take risks and yukino end is inevitable    Volume "a". From the first BD.   post yfw yui kills herself   Why is the whole family dying their hair that color?    But it means that Iroha-like character is his favorite formulas.  When it was in the earlier episode, I still remember Yukinofags attack Irohafags who said that the heroine of Qualidea has Iroha personalities therefore Watari likes Iroha.   It further cements shitpost and attack.  I was the one who said that Iroha-like personalities in his new novel meant that Iroha is gonna have significance later. Yukinofags then attack, rebutted by others while I just watched with a smile on my face         Don't you have Sable to take care of?    MAKE IT HAPPEN     Love is like any other emotion.  You can't detect nuances between different emotions? Even from a purely mental point of view? That isn't healthy. And from a biological perspective different emotions are supposed to cause very different behaviors as they are associated with different hormones and caused by different stimuli.   It is to me, how you handle yourself is normal to you.  No, normal is normal. What is normal behavior for you may or may not be normal in the grand scheme of things. From what you say you do not appear to be normal. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with being abnormal, and such abnormalities are what distinguish individuals from one another, but don't delude yourself with that self-esteem movement bullshit that everybody is normal in every significant way if they think they are normal themselves.   I don't think of people's emotions unless they are stated and I don't intend on mine being known until I state them.  While the latter is admirable, it is incredibly difficult for the average person. You are abnormal in this respect. As for the former, that is simply a lack of empathy.   That might be true too, she is just copying Yui's love of 8man.  Not much I can say here, as you are fundamentally misunderstanding the characters.              I can't imagine having Yukino as a friend and rival in love can be helping this. Yet still she's so nice to them. She really deserves someone who will love and protect her.          There's nothing to insulate Haruno's not just doing this for her own amusement   they're 17 years old and in highschool there's no reason they have to rush this shit.       The Iroha character is Watari's idealized waifu - intelligent, perceptive, and manipulative, with the entire &gt;kohai shit in it    take it up with frogfaggot,he's doing the translation spyro is going to be free and wild after yahari     Yui will become Gahamama in 10 years.    The lie is better than the truth in her view. She can't accept an ending that causes her to be hurt so she chooses to deceive herself.      Yeah I've been there and the nips are saying that her time has ended in the novels. Some think it's ironic how she'll be gone when the club is at it's lowest.  I don't dislike her, so I think this is a bullshit way of ending her part in the story.         implying that's not NotIroha in Yukino's body.   Watari fuses his fetish (Iroha) with a cliche favorite (Yukino).       Incorrect  Doesn't mean the VA did      Yet she will lost her 2 years crush to her best friend who is prettier, smarter, richer than her.  She will become too traumatized to pursuit another love.      In the anime? Everyone knows she won't show up in the last episode. Service club needs to hit the glacier.    Yukinofags need not apply.    she deserves a bullet  good people must die     いろはすが出ない最終回ってなんなんだよ   Yup, that's the end of it.        yfw Yui is Robin Williams        Finally a decent post   GOD DAMMIT     She'll make it bros.       Yui will die attempting autoerotic asphyxiation    I think SNAFU is way better than Toradora    いろはすと八幡のラブコメ中心になるんじゃないか    AYYY       implying Yui wont get Minorin end      bros  yuifags everyone     Only subs I care for are my local Publix's and Firehouse if that means anything     she's done in the novels  According to who?   some anon speculating on 2ch  Okay, buddy.         2 years crush   That's not how it works, bruh.      So she wants everything to stay the same because that way she won't lose her love or her friend? She wants to cock block them? That is kinda selfish.  pic related, she looked half insane in this scene.      It isn't. Main girl is actually entertaining in Toradora.  Yukinoshit stares at the floor.      sure, but is it better than Golden Time?   If Yukino doesn't win, I'll riot.     What does it say, anons?     Get a load of this guy.   I think the copying Yui's love if a bit too far. She didnt even realize about Yui;s feelings for hachiman until Vol 10/11 and she had girl feelings for him for sure by 9 and possibly by 3-6 as well.    Golden Time went downhill real fast.     There's nothing to insulate Haruno's not just doing this for her own amusement  The LN.     They mean the novel. She got turned down by 8man in that spoon scene and since she invited haruno to the event just to get the last arc started, she's gone from the story.      She is staring deep into your soul.     WE NEED EYES EYES IN THE INSIDE     No. Unlike her friend she is strong enough to take such an event in stride and learn from it.    stupid ghost made me drop it    Well she is selfish, but she wasn't being genuine about it until recently. 8man is only one close to being a selfless character in this show.    Golden Times sucked fucken dick      I miss the guy that would eat leather if Yukino loses.      Ilohas x 8man is now the romcom focus    Like the man once said "when the truth is undeniable you create your own"    https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-a/prologue-1/</wbr>   Im burning a couch     take the bait seriously      implying 8man didn't take her to a love hotel right after everyone else left.   She's gone as in 3xnaruto hugging Hinata, malaysian air gone.       It isn't. Main girl is actually entertaining in Toradora.   Obnoxious Tsudnere shit   Entertaining   yeah no piss off        denialfags  Yuifags are still denialfags no matter where they dwell       she got turned down by 8man in that spoon scene   Holy fuck, this meme again. And Iroha doesn't have feelings for him, she still likes Hayama, and Watari doesn't actually like her too right?  Listen, m8. The "..." was at the beginning of the phrase, not the end. We've already had like a half dozen different anons here translate it and debate over its meaning a few threads ago.  The only ones still claiming that scene was a rejection are butthurt fags.           tsundere number #849   violent   entertaining   Sure, anon.       ITS OUT  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Irc<wbr>Ey9JsHLk</wbr>  [ ]    Irohasu!   I'm sure the many quiet Yuifags just really like Yui. It's just the vocal minority who are in denial.   who /falseflag&amp;shitposting/ here    since she invited haruno   Iroha a shit for that reason alone     Everyone needs to chill fuck out.   It's too fucking tense right now, the finale is coming and you guys sound like you're ready to shoot anyone that so much moves a muscle.   You'd think someone was about to get murdered in this thread right now, fuck.       Yeah, this series has a slightly better tsundere shit.     actual chemistry with MC   active, participates in social interactions   Meanwhile:  stares at floor   doesn't say anything to anyone  10/10 character development  I prefer the violent tsundere a million times over Japanese beauty kuudere rich girl that everyone believes is perfect.            Me :^)    NIGGA I'M ALREADY TRACKING EVERY IROHAFAG WITH MY NSA PALS YA'LL GETTING CAPPED TODAY     It cant be any thing too major in the finale otherwise some fag that speaks nipnip wouldve spoiled it already     implying I wouldn't   IROHA OR DEATH  IROHA AKBAR         I don't get why he used a ghost in his work. It was already going well too.      muh mary sue   Also:  girl will bring a wooden stick to whack a bitch   not entertaining               great meme     &gt;actual chemistry with MC   Screaming and throwing violent fits isn't chemistry it's assault and no one sane would put up with it.      I have had to work for myself, I did move back into my mother's house after losing my job though. You could say I failed.   It is easy, she doesn't love 8man and he is just an existence for her to use. It is wrong to use that fact that someone exists like that.    I can tell the difference between emotions, the severity of some are different but at the end of the day apples and oranges are both fruits.   No, normal is normal.  That is just how you think of it it, normal is normal. No one tells me I am not normal except on 4chan (pots and kettles) so I don't think my perception of the world is off. I am a normal person.   it is incredibly difficult for the average person  How? Never assume you have any relationship with someone. No one will care unless you give them reason to.    As for the former, that is simply a lack of empathy.  I am empathetic if people open up to me but you can't expect someone to care when you aren't out with it.    Not much I can say here, as you are fundamentally misunderstanding the characters.  It is just a theory, I think the idea that Yukino thinks she is supposed to love 8man is the real truth though.                     Honestly at this point I just wanted see 8man happy and feel fulfilled in is HS school life at this point.   They obviously answer in Yukino because they both are the ones fixing either and have similar problems so it would make sense they end in a relationship in the end. Yui is really sweet caring girl who help Help 8man along the way but doesn't have the intellect to bring to the next level like Yuknox8man. Iroha is kinda of a side character bu you know she's using her Hayama excuse to get to close 8 man.   Honestly I just don't want all girls to have bad ending but I know thats not possible unless watari's a coppout.       You'll need some diving gear for that, the ones that didn't jump shit are at the bottom of the ocean.     he   It was someone who thinks with hair rather than with brain      New Komachi is a qt. It looks like the new Yukino isn't a shit like the one we already know.      Still going     Man, Charles Darwin would have a field day with 4chan. In the 3 months of BTB Yahari threads we've had, trolls have evolved from simple false flags to try and spark a waifu war to obvious false flags for the sake of some sort of ironic humor.  Congratulations on getting a reply by the way.      This better not be a ruse, anon.     8man  Go ahead, girls who love me, have a love triangle. Be honest and open about it so you can both get hurt. What!? No one has feelings for me. I won't acknowledge that.   He s a dick for giving the girls a green light when he himself isn't ready for romance.  I guess now that Yui can be genuine is she going to try for the 8?         Let's compare some more, m8.   Hey you shouldn't be club president   F-Fine   2 episodes later   still staring at floor   another episode later   Oh, that's why you're upset you fucking autist. Say something.   Meanwhile  Taiga brings a fucking wooden sword to beat a bitch's face in   real bantz with bakachi while all Yukinoshit does is "I'm better than you right? Look at how calm I am."   No contest.   Demeaning and verbally abusing your friend isn't chemistry, it's bullying and no one sane would put up with it.                     and feel fulfilled in is HS school life at this point  He'll continue on with this limbo until the last couple months of high school, at which point he'll finally grow up and begin to cherish his friends and enjoy life until graduation, after which he'll spiral into depression having realized he's Japanese and he'll never be able to be happy again now that high school is over.     AYY LMAO    Oh my god I got a boner just by looking at her.    wanna know who would have a fucking field day with the site? OG freud      new Yukino isn't a shit like the one we already know  She's smiling and has her chin up. That's a good sign.      Don't worry. He'll fix it before his third high school year.    Oh wow I didn't know.          At the bottom of the ocean    With their ship  As it should be, true Irohabros don't jump ship.     Yes, hello.  Where can I get a mobile phone app that allows me to watch animu and manga on the go.   pls no crunchyroll       Google Chrome   rude    kill yourself    ill tell you what, ill tell you the name if you post a pic of some plump anime girl booty    Try killing yourself.      Now if you're playing anime on your telephone...you will never in a trillion years experience the anime. You'll /think/ you have experienced it, but you'll be cheated. It's such a sadness that you think you've seen an anime on your... fucking telephone. Get real.    David Lynch go home.     Fuck off  Have you watched the greatest love story ever told yet?  Mochiron  That's a palmtop tiger!  Yes.    Yeah dude.  I watched Escaflowne back when it aired in 1997.  Up to this day, it's really amazing. Definitely the best love story ever told.          I watched Escaflowne back when it aired in 1997.  Tales of wizardry     It went to shit in the last ~5 episodes when they started liking each other.   Yes. I watched Tamako Love Story when it came out last year.  Get in http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87   We're doing /a/ sings Sono chi, the full version. Recordings are due June 9th.   Email killahspectah@live.com.     What if parts 4 and 5 are part of the same season?    You mean July 9th, you nerd   fourth for wanting to eat hot pants' chunky peanut butter   Was part 4 hinted at?   I'm trying to find something about it but I can't yet.          https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PoR<wbr>Iv1ZDnRI</wbr>  [ ]    b-but, we're already sing it  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2wb<wbr>lN9-05AM</wbr>  [ ]     isn't part 5 kind of long?    SONO CHI NO KIOKU ORA ORA ORA ORA    It felt that way for me until the boss tried killing Trish, then it felt rushed as shit.  What confused me the most is that Giorno couldn't revive Narancia once his body was revived. I mean, Joseph came back to life and we saw his soul pass on for God's sake.     Did Araki every mention if it was Josuke who put his coat under the car and saved baby Josuke, and he just forgot to put it in?   Araki probably forgot Joseph was revived  Or maybe it was because he was revive from vampire blood and not stand magic?      It was just some guy.    Why did araki even revive joseph? I like him but it was so unnecessary.    I'd imagine he wanted to do something about that with Bites za dusto but ran out of time    it was josefumi of course    So we could have character development for Josuke, silly   Would you let rule 63 kira suck on your fingers?   Can Bites za dusto go back that far or am I just naive for not expecting an Araki brand ass pull.    n-no    Maybe he had already planned a bit of part 4's plot?  The only reason they found out about Josuke is because Joseph was planning his will, if he died in SC then DiU would never have happened      o rite  what if Josuke was Holly's second son?      Finding out your dad is dead isn't the type of news a person recovering from a nearly deathlike state needs to hear.    Would she kill me afterwards? I would let her suck my every inch for eternity.    nigger josuke didn't know who his father was until he was like 16  tfw no runaway girl doujinshi      no episode tomorrow    no chapter  I'm not feeling it anymore     Y'know, rule 63 every main villain except for DIO, and I'd be their fuckpuppet for all eternity  and DIO too      Hes talking about holly retard.    Why did that cat plant obey KQ and live in his stomach?    I was talking about Holly you double nigger.    Well this is embarrassing. Meant for<br/>    ZW will never do a porn with SP recording  Fuck DIO. If only he was good. ZW and SP could act all like bros and shit.    oh shieeeeet  fucking misleading faggot          I hate how in Jojo All Star Battle they gave pre Kosaku Kawajiri Kira the shity non killer queen tie.     What if there was a universe where stands were the people and humans were the stands?  What would this scene look like with the other jojo crews?  Continuing from the whole only stand user in the world thing, I think being a vampire would be fucking awesome as long as a random bit of UV light wouldn't kill you. Being able to slowly make my way to the top of the world under a lot of different identities over the years and having my own clan of vampires under me would be sweet.  I'm a VtMfag, shoot me   If you want your Runaway Girl doujin so badly, someone who can write in Japanese without sounding like and idiot please contact the mangaka.

It's weird to think about the fact that Josuke and Holly are siblings   Where was that complaint for the last 2 I made then?    Yeah sure why not Doesn't someone use it to undo the death of the universe in Jorge Joestar     If they fucked do you think they would make a stand like Stone Free?    I've been busy laying low waiting for the final episode hype to die down.       I guess I'll get that version for you soon then.    T-thank you Doc kun~   I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not.             Can stands control their user like that?    Of course not.    That one clip of the two voice actors singing the theme. I want my cookie.      His laughing in this scene was hilarious.   <br/>  Just finished Battle Tendency's adaptation Pretty good, Caesar's  death  scene was done greatly Gonna start SDC adaptation now     no more jojo fridays   &gt;possibly forever     cool   Can anyone give me a better resolution of this? Or rather can anyone dank it up, making him say "I came here to laugh at you" or even "I came here to kek at you"   Why didn't F.F. let herself get revived? She'd probably still be a good guy even if she wasn't the same F.F. Jotaro wouldn't need to worry about Jolyne getting skewered, he could just toss her in the way of some knives, rek Pucci and F.F. could save her.     I already made something like that.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=__j<wbr>PkucX_CM</wbr>  [ ] I just noticed LunarSpiral uploaded this  The girl crying over kakyoins death        Why don't you just go take the screen shot yourself faggot. MPC even has a screenshot key.    this is cute wish i could read it     Thank you Doc kun~    i didn't have the episode anon. don't be an asshole.  thanks doc      Didn't Pucci still have her disc?   Can anyone post the edit of that scene where jotaro lets go of the receipt that says "ur a fag"    he doesn't archive shows until BDs come out       I know anon. I deleted it like a retard. I don't want to download it again though.   Help /a/, my 9 year old cousin wants to be a marine biologist when he grows up. He's already researching all the different types of sharks.   Thank you Doc. You are my favorite   After STALKER      Kakyoin is 178 cm Everyone else is is around 190cm This makes no sense       not starfish  He's okay.     that kid is autistic mane sorry     How are we doing the ora part? Are we doing it like the song or is it a ORA ORA MUDA MUDA scream off?    here's higher res you can repay me by not using the word dank     Dank as fuck, thanks anon.    dank you anon  :^)    BDs when?   Joseph looks like he isnt wearing pants in that scene. Seriously it looks like his hairy ass leg is free in the breeze.     look at how he stands anon he is conscious of his height     https://www.google.com/calendar/emb<wbr>ed?src=ciaual7l89unnh1h4410vmn4u8%4<wbr>0group.calendar.google.com</wbr></wbr>   <br/>   They all aren't wearing pants, anon  Avdol has that censored void and the school uniforms obscure the other two's dongers      Those are called clothes you nudist freak.   Think you can make a better edit than this faggot?     It never even occured to me to think about making Dio's World/Jurassic World edits.     no dick in DIO's mouth   tumblr  what?     Josefumi has a dumb, punchable face. Shit hair doesn't help.   fucking hell doc     kissanime         Pucci attracted 3 of Dio's children   but not Giorno   Imagine if Giorno had been there to fight Pucci with GER  I guess we wouldn't have SBR then though       With all the shit that animeonly fags are giving over the Jotaro Vs DIO fight, just imagine what will happen when King Crimson is introduced.   how many times do we have to go through this, SBR isnt the ireneverse!    sbr isn't the ireneverse or anything like that     Well shit  Sorry, I'm still reading through part 6       The fags were giving shit because they were comparing to the OVA and all that unmanageable hype.    Is this confirmed? I always assumed Araki never confirmed or denied it is the same universe.     Nah, Dio's World really does have a ridiculous amount of "Why doesn't X do Y?" and it's all the more noticable when you're watching it instead of reading it at your own pace.    that's where i watch jojo before i download it if you have a high quality ova download feel free to link it     That too. Lots of plot armor and stupid crap Araki wrote at the time.     animeonly fags   unmanageable hype  oh anon      Are you serious? Did nyaa and all the private trackers shutdown or something?     never confirmed or denied it is the same universe  this, but the joestars being nowhere near florida convinces most people that there is no way for irene to get the star birthmark.     hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm    I failed to understand how this proves anything.   Favorite non Main Villain Stand battle in each part? I'll start. Part 3: D'arby The Gamer Part 4: Highway Star Part 5: Metallica Part 6: Guard Westwood's Secret Part 7: Scary Monsters Part 8: Born This Way         It's not just that. The SBRverse is different in ways that would make no sense if it was because of MIH.   I want the next main Jojo villain to be a girl. Is that too much to ask for?   3. Vanilla Ice 4. Highway Star 5. Metallica 6. Bohemian Rhapsody 7. True Man's World 8. Beetlemania         I think it would be really nice to have a female antagonist for once. I would really like to see what Araki would do.     I'M SORRY?     i'm serious in that i've never bothered to download the ova, yeah   GET IN HERE NIGGA  http://yourafool.keyblade.jp       what the fuck is that   You know what jojo rule 63 art I hope/wish exists? Something that would show Dio and Johnathan's body types being different in some way (like one having bigger boobs than the other or something), making it obvious that DIO has johnathan's body      we posting anime fakes?    where are these from?          I grabbed them from a past thread, reverse search gave me nothing Yukako looks super legit, i would be pleased if that was her official design.     koichi looks like an actual shark     that forehead  HNNNNG      whyy   Nose ruins it. The rest is pretty good tho.      TELL ME ABOUT CRAZY DIAMOND! WHY DOES HE WEAR THE MASK?     They're from Pixiv.     Because his soul couldn't find a body to go into Joseph got lucky and got the joestar blood from dio/Jonathan's body     IF I LOOP TIME WILL YOU DIE?    /jojo/ can get pretty bad as well.    No but it would be very GUREETO    what's wrong with ringo    Shouldn't Killer Queen be skip back and Mandom be rewind?    he bows man    How do you think DIO got women to lust after his dick for children? It was Jonathan's d they were after  men go after just DIOs essence      http://picosong.com/gQ7s/   Practice run, I'm nowhere near manly for this track so I'm gonna take a couple tries over a couple days and see if I improve.     expand my folder please   It's like 2008 all over again.    I thought Narancia was a girl from the start, had me fucked up when I realized there was a dick in between those thighs. It had me  Jaded    What's the difference between infinite speed and time stop?   Please dump all these into an imgur album,oh god.    Dump that shit, fehget    DUDE LOOKS LIKE A LADY    Infinite speed also means infinite velocity, something you can't have in stopped time.          Narancia looks the same    He always does.    No she'd kill you before   just started vol 46 second to last of part 4. favorite fight so far is the superfly tower, but the time loop thing was pretty cool  Should I wait on the retranslation for part 5 to finish or should I just finish it with the(apparently) shit one?    narancia a cute     how far along is the retranslation?  maybe the retranslation will vastly improve the quality of the story and get rid of that sour taste in reader's mouths      yfw Part 4 really might never be animated by David    I just finished the last chapter that was done and Its 4 parts into the fight with pic related.    It's really your call,man.You'll get told otherwise,but part 5 is kind of meh.I can understand why people like it,but I hate it with a passion and wish it didn't exist and anyone who thinks otherwise is a fucking faggot that I don't even want to talk to,but whatever.I don't judge.    No idea what happened. Heres the picture for real.    It's going to happen and you fucking know it.Even if DP hated the series they wouldn't pass up the oprotunity to make some more money.     tfw there is no porn of Johnathan and erina having marital sex with the lights on in the missionary position looking each-other in the eyes for the purpose of having a child.   why live?      Are you talking about the 1st or 4th opening?    so around vol 51-52ish?  I would wait til the whole thing is out but it might take a while. I have no idea how long translations take, what with groups flaking/losing interest      I have some but it's only a few pages long and drawn kind of meh.I can upload it to imgur if anyone's interested.   Chapter When?     Why do people think David won't do it?      do it     eye contact  filthy scum     Can I skip to part 6 without worries then and come back to it? I'm enjoying it so far but fuck me I'm too impatient to wait without something else to read.      Today would be the day by which we usually get a chapter released, but since that’s not the case I feel I should at least post an update about it rather then leave everyone in the dark.     We are having some trouble getting scans from the magazine this month. Usually we have them by day 1 or 2 but when none of the members of the group live in Japan its really a month-to-month, seat of the pants thing, and we haven’t always had perfect luck and consistency with raw provision. This is just one of those months.    Hopefully we will have raws this week and can release the chapter by the weekend or like Monday. Rest assured once we have the raws, we will all work tirelessly to deliver the chapter as quickly as possible.    Thanks for the patience, and please look forward to future releases.           Kars vs DIO  Who would win and why?     All of that and that's what ticks you off?    I've seen like 1. But it sucked.    Dio because he would stop time and send Kars off into space.    dunno haven't read part 6 yet I read everything in this order 3&gt;1&gt;2&gt;4&gt;7&gt;5  was gonna start part 6 after I finish reading Robinson's Starman run at DC       Is it possible to kill Kars?    nice digits    How would he get Kars into space?     killing  who said anything about that? you don't need to kill Kars to win against him.     Kars DIO doesn't have asspulls powers and is literal fodder for pillermen     Found it.https://imgur.com/a/BRytB  It's worse than I remember so I added some good art I had of it at the end      Yeah but it's not like DIO can just throw Kars into space   So I started reading jojo after the show ended and I've gotten to this point.  I'm disconcerted and not really entertained so far. Diamond is unbreakable was great though.   Can I skip this shit ? Should I keep reading ? Is the next chapter better ?   Where the fuck is this story going?         Kars if only because I don't know that Dio could physically kill Kars even with timestop. Sending him to space isn't really gonna work either without a volcano or some other convenience.     skipping     DIO drops a road roller da  made of lava  on Kars   did the anime of part one and two make you go back and reread them with greater appreciation?   If you really have to I think you can skip it  It may be the most unimportant chapter in the entire series      You can skip it,and don't let anyone tell you different.     How would he get Kars into space?   TOKI WO TOMARE   carry Kars on your back   start spouting a generic evil monologue to activate "anime time"   stall long enough to fly all the way into orbit   ???   part 4 animated          araki really should've played up giorno being dio's son as a plot point more. like maybe have him viciously kill one of his opponents or use some of that dio charm some more   it's toki yo tomare you faggot    at least read the good translations anon geez ib4 you ask they're on batoto look harder     It's a meme you dip     Soshute toki wa imoki das      maybe have him viciously kill one of his opponents  you mean like he did to all of his opponents? not a single villain lived in part 5 and most are directly or indirectly killed by giorno       Where the fuck is this story going?  They're gonna take down the boss, duh. You realize there are color scans too right? With better translations to boot.       It's true  Diavolo had an even worse death than Kars       Nigger 4.5 PAGE MUDAMUDA Diavolo GIORNO IS NOT A JOJO. HE IS A FUCKING PSYCHOPATH.        4.5  7 pages anon, double pages count as 2. 7 and a panel counting the spike     He does use the Dio charm all of the crew are his fucking minions. He isn't really 'friendly' with them like any of the other jojos are with their crew     He's not a psychopath. He's something. I can't really tell at this moment since I'm at the beginning of the Pesci fight, but he's not a psycho.    Why does Giorno yell WRYYYYYYYYYYYYY again?  I thought that was a vampire thing?     ザ・ワールド！ 東京止まれ！ WRYYYYYYY       Ok, thank god. I can't take anything seriously.   Mista with his magic bullet dudes   Bruno has dimension zippers   Abachio might as well have nothing   who the fuck knows what narancia does   And I'd be more entertained peeling grapes than having to pay attention to Giorno.             well it is GE yelling it so maybe it is in the brando blood.    Fugo has the most interesting stand but it's only used once  Part 5 was a mess       hating sticky fingers    Does anyone have that webm of dark souls lagstab explaining King Crimson?     I am using batoto I guess I'm just retarded.      I was going to give you a catchup on the things you need to know about it before going to part 6,but then I remembered that literally nothing of lasting importance happens.Skip ahead,my friend.   Why didn't Jotaro just pay to get Jolyne a good lawyer?   no but i have this     Read the guide: http://buyfag.moe   Nah.    Probably end up on amazon.jp next month    They're gachapon, /v/ermin. You can't preorder them.     lunchtime. high school.   social reject mouth breaths down your neck while you're reading.   can I sit at your table?    Nope.   sits down anyway.  What do people hope to gain in a situation like that?         sounds pretty alpha to me   PV: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CLc<wbr>pO8S8tvY</wbr>  [ ]  Only eight days left until the first episode.  I need a thread to deal with the unbearable excitement until it airs.   What's Carol's goal? Destroying the moon? Calling the Custodians? Getting rid of the power of song and Symphogears?       Also Hibiki's new boots look pretty fucking sweet. I never liked her weird black G boots.   Maybe reclaiming the relics. In the PV sword doll shows up in England to attack Tsubasa, coin doll goes after Chris, and Carol tries to nuke Hibiki personally.    Hibiki seemed more like she accidentally stumbled into something which made Carol try to remove her as witness.    How many times have you guys watched the new pv?    at least 10 times. That tempo buildup.    I never counted in the first place. I think I've watched it at least twice every hour.     I lost count Nonstop since yesterday     Watched? No idea, but I listened to it a million times.    Too many times. I've also probably listened to it 3x more often than I've seen it. Symphogear is the only show that manages to get me hyped up like this.   Reminder that Maria is not useless. She is directly responsible for:  Revealing FIS to the world and putting gang on the quest to save the world. Exposing the Americans as dirty backstabbing jerks. Taking care of Shirabe and Kirika. Taking the burden of playing Fine so they could get help. Raising the Frontier. Curing Hibiki's space cancer. Giving Hibiki a new Gungnir. Satisfying the fantasies of 7 billion people by stripping both herself and Hibiki nude on life TV Saving the world by activating Arghaitlahm.

Maria's too old to be wearing these cute girlish clothes.    alot   This Touhou big bad is really cute.   She's young in her heart so it's okay.      Man this fight is gonna look great.     Let's hope it's not like S2 where first half was amazing and then everything started falling apart.  is there a translation for the PV?   http://symphogear.blogspot.de/2015/<wbr>06/new-promotional-video-released.h<wbr>tml Song translation. </wbr></wbr>   I was hype so I drew a derpy Hibiki. Any simple requests so I can waste more time?    I hope we get to see her this smug in the show at some point. There's not enough Smugbiki.    DMJii kissu     find this thread   watch the PV   start downloading the first two seasons  How much time do I have to binge watch them and catch up for the first episode of GX?       T-too complex for me. I already suck at facial expressions.     You've got time. First airing is on July 3rd, I think it was, but subs will probably take a while.    8 days anon. Plenty of time to watch 26 episodes. Keep in mind though that it takes about 4 episodes for the first season to get interesting.      What convinced you? The punching, the explosions, the singing or the concert?    S1 is like Nanoha's, it should pick up after 6 episodes or so. On a rewatch all of it is enjoyable though.    Maria genuflecting. We'd probably get a lot of use out of it this season.     Grand so, plenty of time.   I truly appreciate the concept of punching stuff while singing        L F P  Any ideas?    Welcome to the hype train. Why did it take you so long to discover Symphogear?    Just kinda ignored it when it aired first, I've started to like mahou shoujo a bit more recently though. I always like stuff that's a bit different so I can't wait for S1 to finish downloading, honestly.    You have plenty of time, please enjoy yourself. Just a heads up, it's yuri as all hell on top of the fighting and singing.     Lesbian Fisting Punch    This just gets better and better.      What time of day is it airing? The site lists 27:10 on July 3rd which doesn't make any sense.    24+3.16 h?    27:10 simply means 3 hours and 10 minutes after 24:00, so it's 3:10 July 4th.     he doesn't use a 30 hour clock     So thats ~4:10 PM eastern on thursday right?    Never mind I'm retarded. Its on the friday.     more than half of those weren't even planed  I know it's the joke, but it's still pretty sad when it's all written down like that.     I don't care about the plot, I just want to know if there'll be more training regimes from old kungfu movies while singing hot blooded Cantonese songs.    100% guarantee    I miss that slutty edgy badass geah cape Seriously she had the best design. If only it was similar and black on Hibiki too after she stole it     The prehensile nature of that cape was fantastic.    We could have lost the scarf     slutty   cape  What? Also she only had it because she was afraid of everything and needed something to protect herself with, so Gungnir gave her a cape.  Gungnir is pretty bro.  user seems to hate heels   give her proper boots in the next version   she also seems to prefer to punch things   give her piston and revolver gauntlets    this other user wants to hide from everything   give her a giant awesome cape that can cut and grab things and turn into a tornado                Bikibutt.    Blue is the only doll for me.    Reminder that the blue doll is Miku's reanimated corpse.    I like how Aoi still remembers the lyrics to Eiyuu Eiyuu Koji. https://d.maxfile.ro/uyptxnwngi.mp3<wbr></wbr>     Did someone say HOT BLOODED CANTO SONGS?  https://<span>youtu.be/AiluIsFXxI4  [ ]       Miku's  Uhhh     Care to actually add some substance to your posts?     P   That's a thorn.      Can Miku handle Hibiki's determination to fist?    Sure. You made a fucking mistake and Miku isn't dead you stupid fuck.    What? I know she isn't dead  yet . I think you're the one who has made some kind of mistake.     Every night.    Then why would you even post a picture of a different character?    Oh, you thought I thought Serena was Miku. Yeah, no. Sorry. It was just a way of conveying my thoughts of the idea.      Carol a cute. Too bad about all that edge.  So are we going to get previews of the battle songs or not?   Witch Chino did nothing wrong.    Shooting death lasers at Hibiki seems pretty wrong    Woah    You mean like this? Somehow I think I got it all wrong.  Holy shit this was more difficult than expected. Not only is the pose really hard from any perspective but the side but Maria's gear really doesn't work in anything except a neutral pose without stabbing herself with all the metal parts.       Maria's gear really doesn't work in anything except a neutral pose without stabbing herself with all the metal parts   So she is useless even on design?      Some anon a thread or two back mentioned it meant "that which is forbidden."    The one with her stabbing herself could be funnier.    Not that anon, but it looks great to me.    I actually meant the orz pose. I just googled genuflect and I see where you got the idea. Sorry for not explaining it better. You did a nice job with that pose though!   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tQC<wbr>EVb4r5zE</wbr>  [ ] Reposting from /m/     These both look pretty great, but Bikkie's expression is a bit weird  and her bikkies are too small      what the fuck am i watching?    Looks more like Ryuko   On three days (5-6-7 July), they're going to marathon both S1, G, as well as 2013 Live on Nico. http://www.symphogear-gx.com/specia<wbr>l/special03_niconico.php</wbr>    But I'm in the middle of doing that already.    noice.    is it bad i simply want a scene of genjuro just whooping the every living shit out of either the dolls or magical girl edge-chan?     重大発表もございますのでお見逃しなく！！   Seems they will also have major announcement      The best I can imagine is a new live show, and I would be very please with that.    Can I expect a game or movie?    If they announced a game I'd shit myself.  If Platinum was making it I'd shit myself harder.     I like some of the soundtrack better than some of the songs.  https://d.maxfile.ro/wogufllati.fla<wbr>c https://d.maxfile.ro/fmfmtkejmo.fla<wbr>c</wbr> </wbr>    Hold on to your butts   Platinum don't like moe games, go ask others like Gust or even Koei.    Only if it's their A-team and not their Korra team.   That logo remains the coolest fucking shit.        7:50-8:20    My sides are going to the moon      Same. This is the best one in my opinion. http://picosong.com/YpAn/     It's so fucking good.    More like 80 days because subs where.     S1 is like Nanoha's, it should pick up after 6 episodes or so.  Are you kidding, Sympho is the first time in a while I watched the first 5 episodes of a show glued to my seat.     Same, I loved it from the start. I don't understand why people hate on the first few episodes.     implying   anon it got good when hibiki did dat training montage with genjuro so towards the end of episode 4.      I don't understand why people hate on the first few episodes.  It's because you're not allowed to like anything with a dark tone.     mostly because tsubasa's edge early on was pretty damn thick, i mean, its understandable, but god damn.   I want to fuck Kirika.   Shirabe pls.      How would people react if Hibiki died halfway through and Miku ends up inheriting her Gungnir?      probably mad as hell because hibiki is best girl.    Pretty peeved Unless its some like ghost hibiki lives in Gungnir and they share control of her body when they fight thing mite be cool     KAKU OE KOE TA SAKI NI     HAJIMARU UTA HAJIMARU KODOU     This is so unattractive, why is her underwear shaped like a heart? And her limbs are bent in ways that looked like they'll crack off. Give me  any day.    How would people react if Miku died halfway through and Hibiki'song became the song that destroys the world?     why is her underwear shaped like a heart?  Because it's following the contours of her ass and because it's sexy  And her limbs are bent in ways that looked like they'll crack off  Except that's wrong.       I'd wonder why it took them so long.   http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/genjuro.php Genjuro: "Since the opponents are not the Noise, it should be my turn to fight them!"  The staff knew it.   </wbr>   I'd question why it didn't happen last time she thought Miku was dead.    but her ass looks weird like her cheeks are just barely clinching together since there's so much space inbetween them    Why the fuck are they fighting each other again  I can't wait for the CDs.      Hibiki becomes gungnir-chan?     Fighting each other again   Did you even watch the PV?      That OST That Tsubasa     this is everything i wanted.   I want to get fucked by Tsubasa-senpai's sword.   I want to penetrate Bikki's Rainbow Flower.    Aww yes, there better be an entire episode dedicated to him kungfu fighting the shit out of enemies.    Looks like a senketsu color palette     Google translate   If the other party is not a noise, I will protrude ~Tsu!      I want Genjuro to move fast enough to look like he's flash-stepping while dodging Carol's danmaku shit.   And then he pulls off a SICK ASS HYPER BOMB     http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/shirabe.php  Other than Kiri-chan, I don't want anyone to see my embarrassing parts.  Welp.  </wbr>   What if Genjurou loses badly and gets hurt to show how serious things are?    Yes. In the first half of the PV there are clips of kirika/shirabe fighting and tsubasa/chris.    ...  That's just reused footage from G. Are you stupid or just acting?      GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYY<wbr>YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY! they arn't even trying to hide it anymore. </wbr>    LEWD    I think you misinterpreted the question. Why are they fighting? I'm wondering why they are using those clips. Is it some kind of foreshadowing? are they going to end up fighting again?   omoshiroi      Yaa, gomen gomen!        TADIMA     Gashunk!   HANASE!  M-MASAKA!    D-Dame.   TEME KONO YARO   HAYAI!  BAKANA!   every time   BAKA HENTAI!   fuck spiders   Tuskete!    Fucking Niggers.     Did that last one hit him in the eye?    why you gotta do this s4s-kun  why      yes    Yes.    Black people, man.    Why would you ever kill an elephant. Why don't you just leave it do its own thing. Eat some fucking plants, shit a lot. What the fuck man.    Is that Serena Williams?   To sell the tusks.    this one is just sad     Why would you ever kill an elephant.  sometimes they get to close to villages and destroy their crops or its for their ivory     gotta gi me som ivory mayne.   Ittekimaaasu!  K-kaa-san, Yamete kudasai.      That's depressing.  Fuck       this was the saddest shit ever in this movie    what the fuck's wrong with it?    Chinks will pay out the ass for magic dick tusk magic pills.  And y'know, elephants do have a nasty habit of stomping on farmland and eating villagers crops.      yes  no      food and safety bull elephants regularly kill people and destroy crops     j-just run pleeease    fuck you    never gets old    This. Chinks pay a fucking huge amount of money for this shit. Same goes for turtles from Madagascar.    Lion cub broke its back while hunting with its mom. Lioness left it to die.    I'm Crimean rivers here.    Somehow I didn't find it as bad as that sloth program they advertised with "babies getting pajamas! So cute!"  The weaker baby dies and then the second one refuses to eat or move and dies. Sloths just fucking give up. Like there's a video on youtube of a cougar chasing a sloth and the sloth just closes its eyes in pain and lets go.  Predators have so much more fun than sitting in a tree until an eagle eats you, even lion cub played for a while.   !!!   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=90M<wbr>7kH5wCtA</wbr>  [ ]  damn        Jesus Christ. I couldn't imagine being the photographer just watching that shit unfold and not doing anything about it.    Why'd they have to name the sloth? Why?    SARABA DA!    Did that gerbil just dropkick that cat?    3 of them hit it in the eyes    Domestic hamsters tear each other apart, wild hamsters will tear you apart. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Cf0<wbr>6WJQ4FnE</wbr>  [ ]     I had one cannibalize the other that I had in the cage with it and then hump its corpse   they were both female       I know that feel.

You don't take chances with hippos.    If you're hunting, don't you want to make sure it's dead? I hate this stupid "don't hurt animals!" mentality where everybody assumes they're just killing because they can.     not FROG GUNDAMU, IKIMASU!     Hippos kill the most out of any animal and you DON'T want to be near it if it's angry.     dat sloth qt       Hamtaro gone wild  and wrong .   Ehhhhhh?!

Based Hippos    This, hippos are scary    Hippos are  big  animals    It's not like the hippos are killing anything that matters.      yes goyim. It is the dumb brown peoples who are your real enemy!       elephants regularly kill people  [citation needed]   I think you're mistaking elephants for hippos.       You saying humans don't matter? How pro-hippo can you be?       Where were humans mentioned? I thought we were talking about Africans?      black screen, oh oh I dont want to play that webm    There's baby goats and dolphin, trust me.      African nigger reporting in.  Hippos need overkill.  They WILL fight to the very end.  They're insanely tough creatures, even on the brink of death.  You know how white people call brave people "lions"?  Well in much of Africa, brave people were called "Hippos"               That one of the dog chasing the deer   That's all swell and nice, but giving a teeny bit of a distorted view of reality. 99.999999% of the time things don't work out like that. For every 1 dog and monkey pair of buddies, there's 5,000,000,000 wildebeest that are eviscerated and literally eaten alive by hyena.        That's how our ancestors hunted long long ago too.        How fucking tough are they?      I man up and did it, thanks anon    Stop being such a fucking killjoy faggot.    die three hours later in the woods tough    Don't think about it      Lion cub broke its back while hunting with its mom. Lioness left it to die.     MOSHI-MOSH~   Elephants can cry?    did the people rescue it?   OYASUMI   Of course not. Wildlife photographers are liberal assholes who would rather watch animals die on film than help them.   Mitte, mitte!   For you   ITADAKIMASU!  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190321  omg is it okay??    Rule number one in to not interfere with nature. How they live their lives has worked well for millions of years and as tragic as it may be that lion cub in death will give life back to something else.   Human factory farming is a million times crueler than that but do you think twice about chicken or beef products?     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190321  disgusting   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190321   daijobu?    I really hate this obsession over 'saving' animals and treating them with rights, oftentimes treating them better than your fellow humans. Interfering with nature is the worst thing you can do.  Sometimes make me wish our culture was similar to asian ones.       It'd be more liberal to intervene you dumbshit     fucking why what the fuck is this obvious the bizon wanted to get away couldn't he get out the fucking way jesus man herbivores are fucking retarded        All that movement open the wound so wide its entire insides spilled out. Daijōbude wa arimasen   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190321   tries to bite off its own guts   that's some apostle shit there.      So how much money does random wild animal B deserve to keep it alive instead of being random wild animal T's lunch? Small things in reserves work, but treating something serious that will pull the animal out of any social contact for weeks or months will fuck it over indefinitely unless you pump even more money into reconditioning areas. A guy who's good with a camera isn't the person to rely on for those facilities.    instead of ramming the other bison it could've also just barreled through the wolf pack. "I'm not d-doing this because I like you or anything, b-baka." would be a possibility, yet theat cunt goes all "Keikaku Doori" on it's ass.

What the fuck    Whoops, didn't mean to quote.     Sometimes make me wish our culture was similar to asian ones  And there's this weeb.     Ok so how would you deal with the lion cub?     Congratulations your a libtard fuck living in the south?  What more do you want to know?       I-ikuuu~    Whoops, looks like someone spilled their yogurt on a bird!     Sometimes make me wish our culture was similar to asian ones.  shut he fuck up please.  wow this thread is full of all kinds of ignorant stage 4 cancer        Liberal has meant "anything I personally disagree with" for years.     it probably doesn't recognize what his intestines are. he just felt pain in that area and tried to pull of what he must've thought was causing it.   Yada.    Calling someone a weeb while on /a/ and shitposting in an offtopic thread  Please.     Fuck, I laughed     bird bukkake     Damn. That bunny looks hella comfy    Wouldn't it be more conservative to not save the cub in this case? If you're liberal, you'd save it, right?   .... CHOTTO MATTE KUDASAI!     implying conservatism is RULES OF NATURE   implying some of the greatest conversationalists and wildlife enthusiasts weren't conservatives      M-Masaka...   Wait, no, I've got it. A lion with wheels!   Kuso!  Fucking nyaaggers!!!    Neeeee-ssssaaan   Shoot it, like a true patriot.    KILL IT WITH FIRE    seriously fuck that smiling piece of shit.   Mou... Owari da...   ugh. The fuck, man    just before someone talks about blood; its not blood, its just the spittle from it.   hurts though       this if you can save it then why the fuck not, just because you save one fucking animal doesn't mean you support some bullshit make believe ideal where you want everything in nature to get along.  you saw some sad shit, so you help the cunt out.      It's almost like people can't just be lumped into two groups based on their beliefs in regards to wildlife and the environment.   Tadaima!  N-nande sugoi??   Americans link everything with politic.

Don't be tricked so easily  Try and think of one character that hasn't raped Tohka  I can't      Natsumi is gayer than Miku. And Yoshino is okay with it.     Mana     Flatori best imouto  Nothing to disagree about. Shidou already agreed, don't bother him about it.      But this entire volume was everyone raping Shidou.     The only rapey thing involving Tohka is her raping shido's mouth     I want to fuck the shit out of Kotori and make her my wife.     Get in line.    Why does she wear panties under her pajama?    Who doesn't?     I don't     - Shidou coughed. He remembered the promise with Tohka. After he captured Yoshino, Tohka said "don't kiss with anyone else but me" to him. Shidou keep quiet about it since he can't make Spirits become emotionally unstable.  - Shidou tried making an excuse. But Tohka said sorry that she made a contradict condition to him. She asked Shidou to save Spirits, yet disallow the method to do that. - However, Tohka then continued that he should have told her back then. She thought Shidou have other ways of sealing Spirit Power for all along.  - Shidou said sorry to her and lowered his head. Tohka shook her head once again and tell him she forgive him, but with a condition. Shidou widen his eyes because Tohka, while knitting her brows at the pain, climbed down from her bed and climbed up into his bed.   "Er, Tohka?" "I don't have any complains. But since Shidou violated our promise, —"  - Tohka counted off her fingers while calling the Spirit's name. Yoshino, Kaguya, Yuzuru, Miku, Natsumi, Origami. Tohka blushed and say in small voice,  "…Seven. That's the number of times you kept secret from me. I'll forgive you this time with seven kisses." "Wha…? H-hey, wait, Tohka!?" "No questions. Or you don't want to kiss with me?" "No, that's not what I meant, others are —" "Then there's no problem! Sit still. I'll be done fast." "W-Wait!"  - Tohka covered up him and pushed her lips toward Shidou's lips. Shidou feel a pleasure like his brain is burning up.  "N…chu…" "…! …!!"  - That moment,                          "Sorry to keep you waiting, Shidou. I've brought everyo —"  - The door opened. Kotori froze in front of it. Tohka widen her eyes in surprise and separate her lips away from his. Shidou's lips got pulled with her lips a little before it bounced back.  - Their lips are connected to each other with glittering thread made of saliva. With that scene, Kotori and the Spirits, and Mana rushed into the room.  "W-wait, what were you doing in this short timespan, Shidou!?" "U-um… you both just recovered, I think you…" "Ka, kaka… Tohka sure takes the cake." "Pointing out. Kaguya seems frustrated." "Kyaa! Eh? I didn't saw it properly, so could you do it again! Again please!" "UAW… you just woke up and did that… how gross." "…As expected, I can't be off guard." "Nii-sama! What are you doing!?"  - Everyone said that and surrounded Shidou's bed.  "H-hey, everyone calm down. I…"  - Shidou tried smoothing it over. However, he couldn't came up with any excuse.   "Muu…"  - Tohka is also the same. Since it came to this, Tohka then hugged Shidou. The Spirits raise up their voices "Ahh!".   "Haha…"  - In the tumult that Shidou felt it has been a long time since he heard it, he patted Tohka head while smiling bitterly.   [End]                               I WANT TO FUCK KOTORI!    this blatant favoritism     Based Tohka!    SEVEN  KISS     SUMMARY ANON WE LOVE YOU THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.   Remember Kaguya a cutie    Tohka being sly, that was great.  Also, thanks summary anon. You're too good to us. Get some sleep.       At this point, if this ends up having a harem ending it will be just an excuse to please the fans.    Time to sleep summary anon. Respects and thanks to you. Good night.      Thank you a lot, Summary Anon.      Thanks man and God bless you, splendid job with all the summaries.    Tohka BESSST  also thank you so much based summary anon. Sleep well      Afterword?    Why you dont suck a dick faggot, he do the whole volume already.        FUCK THIS RETARD FAVORITISM SHIT      Who cares about the afterword? I could probably tell you what's there.     Their lips are connected to each other with glittering thread made of saliva  Lewd. Thanks so much based summary anon    ku ku ku thank you summary anon   Tohka wins a flawless victory. Don't worry Origami, you can still be second.    Greedy retard, seriously I doubt this series will have a harem end.    Well I can't really be mad since she's got the guts to take the initiative. Night! Thanks    It will.   as long as bwaka gets her kisses      Tohka a greedy girl. Shidou belongs to everyone.    Thanks a lot, you're the real hero    Unless we  kill the Tohka.     S2 BDs never, did FFF drop it or is anyone else doing them?    and people say there is no favoritism in this novel.    Postword  - This is the first book since Tachibana's debut with a male character on the cover (total of over 20 volumes!). - The spread illustration this time is 'that thing'. If you don't know what it is, then open volume 1 page 131 (chapter 2). What a long foreshadow. Was it even a foreshadow? - New series "Itsuka Sekai wo Sukuu Tame ni -Qualidea Code-" will be released on August 18th. Illustrated by Haimura Kiyotaka. In a world that has been evaded by an enemy of grotesque looks, boys and girls are fighting to protect their country… but those boys and girl don't really care about the world being in danger or whatsoever. They just pour their love into a certain girl. It's like Origami being split into several characters. What is that how scary.  - Dragon Age 2015/09 will have Date A Live Marugoto BOOK that complies all articles from Dragon Magazine with few Tsunako illustrations that never been recollected anywhere before. - PSV Date A Live Twin Edition Rio Reincarnation out August 30. - Date A Live SS1 BDBOX coming out on August 31 with additional scenes. - Date A Live Mayuri Judgement screen August 22.  - See you again in DAL13 or Itsuka Sekai wo Sukuu Tame ni -Qualidea Code-.  - Tachibana will still continue writing DAL so don't worry.    Bed time. It was fun guys.  mfw back from Japan on August 19th   mfw movie will be screened on 22nd                     What a greedy slut  she needs a spanking from Reine     Not since volume 2.   You are the best summary anon! Thanks!   And she's even more dangerous now that she knows she loves him.   Night! Thanks       Thanks for this. http://pastebin.com/Kcm2PsAm      good to know Tachibana hasn't given up     I am, and I'm up first.    Thanks anon.    Thank you summary anon!   Movie thread next?   Thks for all your hard work, great summary Good night     Yes she is.   So now that we this  What was everyone's general thoughts of the volume?    She deserves more kisses anyway. Its only fair since he lied to her!    No she was just being retarded    3.5/5  A bit goofy. But we learned a bit more. Even if just a little.. Still enough to speculate      I don't think it was a Volume 7, but not bad. Though Tachibana sure loves to take his time with the reveals.  DAL 25 last volume?     meh it was alright all the plot happened then it was date time fallowed by main girl favoritism then it sets up for the next volume    It's a set up novel. Asked more questions than it answered and did more foreshadowing than we've had in a while.  Oh and it put Tohka at the head of the competition for the Shidobowl in case anyone had forgotten.      It was alright. And at least everyone got kisses    Probably going to have to back and reread the Phantom parts. That was a lot of info that just seemed to be out there.    Average, too much fanservice and not enough plot. Disappointed Shidou didn't do much in berserk mode.     with few Tsunako illustrations that never been recollected anywhere before.  My dick is ready.     A bit of a delay on a new spirit... Which is disappointing. But after the end I can't really complain that much    Things look bleak for the harem end, darn you Tachibana   So what do we think the last few spirits powers are?   Better than volume 5 and 6 but worse than 7. I was expecting much more.    4/5 It was ok, have a little plot and Shidou berserk was fun    Yeah, but it doesn't look like anyone is catching up to Tohka anytime soon.   No.2 spirit Next time   Inverse Kurumi when?     I wouldn't say bleak.. Note Tohka somewhat acknowledged she loves the others too. And I think she may just want some special treatment if he's gonna do stuff with the others too    Nah, still going to be a harem end. The harem will be "Tohka and all the others" though.     Once again, thanks a lot Summary Anon.   Such a bad timing indeed, Just a couple days away from the movie!        She's probably fine as long as he gives her some extra lovin. Which is kinda cute actually.    Not bad but disappointing overall, the scene where all the girls kissed Shidou was underwhelming as fuck.    WHY DID THEY CUT HER HAIR?!?    Nepgear?   Vol.20  Reine True End     I don't know if it's just the summary downplaying it or not, but I feel the same way about the dates too.    Tohka literally holds an advantage because she gets jealous  Its the ultimate weapon in harems. Kotori is waaay to discreet with her jealousy, while Tohka will literally voice how she feels. Being okay with a harem end (like miku is) doesn't actually bode that well for an individuals chances    Who the fuck is Mio    Keep in mind, we only read the summary. Translator anon, what were your thoughts?    You'll have to wait until tomorrow, he's probably long gone.    The Momo paradox in action.    Oh god my heart, she was so perfect.    Best mom deserves a good route.    I feel a bit angry to be honest, all that wait and only the last chapter is plot, some dates were weak and the scene with the girl kissing Shidou even though he was going berserk and the girls had little to no power was bland.    I think it was kinda cute. Mostly fluff in this volume. With some tiny bits here and there of plot hints   No.2 spirit Next time   Inverse Kurumi when?    Miku is worst girl   You think that the volume with Shidou on it would be more plot heavy, but apparently not. Quite a bit of setup, but otherwise just a twist to the generic DAL formula.    It was fun.    I think that's what almost everyone expected but the worst part is with Shidou going berserk this volume Tachibana can't use this plot point again for future volumes.    Moegami is best Origami.     we will never get her decently animated      Interesting slow down volume. Like the reverse take on making the Spirits take on Shidou instead of the other way around.     They aren't too far behind     That's a nepgear   This is also a nepgear.      Tohka has like 12 kisses now. Who's next, Yoshino with 4?      Maybe?... You never know with Tsunako.      Sure they can. Next time he can skip the berserk state and go straight to Inversing and raining fire and brimstone ovee the world.    Decent for a break volume but It didn't excuse the amount of time we wait for it.   Movie Thread Next?   but we need build up first and there must be a really good reason for that to happen considering Shidou didn't even go inverse this volume   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127188584  I would have done her doggy style right then and there.    This may as well as be it, considering the thread is new and will be probably be here all night.

Plus now we know that Mana was actually kidnapped and something happened to Mio. However that happened four years ago, which was after Shidou was left with the Itsuka family. It's all a crazy time line.    This. Long wait, then Shidou on cover, "Itsuka Disaster", but it's just a break volume. Maybe there are some consequences for Shidou going berserk later on?    mfw tell myself I'll drop the series if the retard asks for kisses for all the spirits he's sealed   she does   It was a good run guys, dropping the series.      Shidou suddenly recalling those events, Mio and Phantom lines were the only new info we got in this volume, sadly.    I'd make her do more than sweat.    She only gave Shidou 1 extra kiss.    Ellen kills Mana in front of Shido after a whole volume of childhood establishing flashbacks.    SUFFERING SINCE KURUMI GOT NOTHING.   INB4 HER FAULT  I know. But still. It was alright. Also tohka has a frighteningly insatiable appetite for shidou kisses.      It's not a bad idea but Mana must become a spirit if she wants to get relevance for more than 1 chapter.    Not just that, but we also got info about Mana's situation. Ellen apparently was the one who captured Mana. I have to question if it was DEM or Phantom who memory wiped Mana, considering how we've only seen Phantom with the power of memory wipes. Plus it seems if Shidou does get his memory back, he's going to have real resentment against DEM.   Not only that, but we also got a better idea of Phantom's goal thanks to the explanation of Sephira crystals.      Dates were enjoyable, all the girls got kisses, setting up plot for the next arc, dealing with Kotori's killing Shidou bullshit. It was an alright bridge volume, so to call it. Too much blatant Tohka favoritism, but then again, it's Date A Tohka     I feel like the author trolled us with this volume. Anyway, it would be lame if he decides to use the "Shidou going berserk thing again" I mean the only threat he posed was being a time bomb but he wasn't destroying the city like Origami did and the girls in those very weak forms still managed to stop him.     Not just that, but we also got info about Mana's situation. Ellen apparently was the one who captured Mana  but Mana getting kidnapped by DEM wasn't anything new. We even speculate about it in older threads.     Don't worry author will reward us with Inverse Kurumi   Miku is worst girl  Any ideas what the next spirit will look like  Long hair and young looking.   another nep clone    Meant for      If she is Number 2 she may have silver/gray hair. If she is Number 6 she may be the drill/blonde high-class type girl. If she is not a Number she may refer to herself as a FREE GIRL.     Either a blonde or grey haired girl, he can also save time and just create another Nepgear.    Mayuri    Thats not Flatori    if some how he makes the movie cannon   Considering the current LN world and how it's developing, and how we pretty much got Birispirit for the movie  here's the daily prayer for Mayuri being tsuntsun   I'd say the next spirit will be some sort of sly foxy kouhai type of girl, if you know what I mean.       Grope her    What part will you grope?      (You)   What part will you grope?   this should be obvious her motherly mounds       Stop making fun of my girlfriend, asshole.    FLAT   So I just finished rewatching S1, does the novels go back and explain more about how Mana as approximately 10 years to live? Or is that something that hasn't been delved into yet since we haven't had a Mana Arc yet in the LN?   She's delicious     Natsumi's loli form still has a bigger chest than Kotori    I can't wait to gaze upon this cute creature   WIZARD MAGIC AIDS  AINT GOT SHIT TO EXPLAIN   Her body was altered in order to manipulate magic on a higher level than a normal realizer, however she's not too compatible with it or something and that fucks her up.<br/>          She'll be the first Spirit that Shido cannot save.     Yes she is.   You say that like it's a bad thing.      Her body's being destroyed by the power jammed into her     causing this much despair in a LN   in DAL of all places  lolno      Technically that was Rinne in her first end    Multiverse theory will make Mayuri cannon    Get out toriyama    What's the difference between Kotori's bra and Tohka's head?   Nothing they're both empty       I'd jam something into her alright.    Magic surgery    I want to take Mii on a dato.    movie will be a reset like utopia and remain Canon/ non canon indefinitely but will still be referenced in the main novel    but that was Kurumi    hasn't saved yet    The author never reuses the same endings, just look at Arusu.    11/10 Funniest post of the day.     Could happen. They've been hinting for a long time that when a Spirit dies it leaves a Sephira. If Mana's mostly dead and a Spirit is actually dead, the solution seems obvious.  Also, baseless speculation, but what if Mio is Shido and Mana's older sister?   Why does she have breasts.         Because she can't be saved, Shidou failed in volume 3 and there is nothing he can do about it.    I want the entire trio    but there is the problem she doesn't have a number in her name.    You can have the other two. I want to cutie with the glasses.    DAL isn't that dark and after all the origami bullshit you expect me to believe she won't be saved?    Anime breasts enhancement.   All the games are canon.   but Origami only killed her parents unlike Kurumi who has killed 10000+ people and I doubt Shidou will go back to the past again if Kurumi's plan involves killing Shidou and take his powers.      I think Mio was a friend of Shido and Mana's mother trusted before leaving for plot.  Also which are the kanjis for Mio in this novel?     I want to marry and anally ravage Tame   Except Ars Install and the third game.   Reminder that Mana is a placeholder and a plotdevice  Reminder that Mio is Shidou's and Mana's childhood friend who was captured by DEM along with Mana  Picture related, Mio and Tohka being sluts        Why does she have breasts.   Because she's best sister  more like only sister, fakes don't count       Cute as fuck  She's my second favorite.      Then there is a strong likely hood of the movie in some way being cannon the author dose have a hand in it after all    Too many sisters    Phantom is Rinne     too many sisters  Never     Shido is a generic nice guy he wants to save all the spirits    Glasses    Only Rinne Utopia is canon.    Tohka is pure anon    based summary anon. You tha' MVP.    and what does that have to do with saving Kurumi if he doesn't have the means to stop her?    Technically, neither does Reine. Not arguing your point, just observing.   Dunno, plus we only have her first name.      Miku is worst girl   Bwaka's can't be pure.     not liking glasses.     then neither does Shidou      Knowing the author he will come up with a solution such as Phantom sending shido back to stop her from killing the First because that doesn't fit with phantoms objective     wanting 7(SEVEN) kisses all at once   "pure"     Ratatoskr is filled with assholes, why not just hire better personal?    Doesn't love dfc Kotori  Why is awful normalfag-like taste like this allowed?     Phantom doesn't have time travel powers.   Now we have to wait for the actual translation   it's not confirmed that she doesn't have some form of it   Best Imouto  Shidou said so, don't bother him about it     Like the others aren't going to press for an equal number themselves, so status quo will be preserved.    Amusingly, he does: 五河. Five.    but that is Kotori's family name not Shidou's.     loli <br/>   Kiss count  Tohka: 5 Kotori, Yoshino: 3 Everyone else: 2  Disgusting         Tachibana would never do that considering Phantom is using Kurumi for her cause.    You're cute. Here's your reply.     he doesn't like glasses     Yoshino has 4 if you count that one in Date A Origami    Retard Favoritism    No Kotori's cute. That anon is just a shit head.    More like magnificent  If only she wasn't interrupted. Damn you Tachibana.     by the end of the series Tohka will have more than 10 kisses.    Excuse me while I vomit    dose Phantom truly want Kurumi to kill the first spirit? that is the question that would determine her action     The way it should be    She will die    He doesn't go by Takamiya though. He even thinks of himself as Itsuka.    and taken a half dozen dicks    Quit shit posting and hiding behind Tohka. No wonder no one likes her.    No, that's why I said Phantom was using Kurumi for her own cause.    Belive in the multiverse    But that's wrong.  I love her     He's still a Takamiya and Wetscott said he doesn't know anything about Itsuka Shidou but Takamiya Shidou is a different story.    That doesn't apply in the DALverse.    You're not helping her image. I liked her too, but you're leaving a bad impression.      Tohka in charge of remaining a virgin   A failed task if ever there was one      More likely because people are jelly the based Tohka, despite being a "retard" still manages to hold the lead.   Hopefully       fair enough, though I believe she will go through a hell of suffering then ultimately own up to what she has done, then and only then can she find redemption and be saved    Is there a pastebin with the entire summary?   He's taunting Shidou. What Shidou calls himself won't change even when his memories of his birth family return.    Retard.    Even a piece of shit can get the lead if the author writes it like that. Look at Oreimo    Utopia pretty much proves there is a Multiverse or at least alternate timelines    and? Shidou is still a Takamiya who was adopted by the Itsuka family.     Look at Oreimo  FUCK YOU, I ALMOST FORGOT    Serious question though, where does this rape joke come from?   What the fuck are you saying? Rinne just created a dream world. DAL only has different timelines so far.     joke      Kirino   bad  Fuck off mang.      From 4chan.     joke     Way back when volume 7 was not even translated we got spoiler with Westcott saying he wanted to steal Tohka's pride as a woman or something,    Someone thinks they're funny cause they spammed "retard" and "tohka was raped" for the past 2 years.    Volume 7 spoiler and that pic with mind boken Tohka.      Retard    Yeah, that was a thing that happened. It's legitimately creepy too, but the spammers are just spewing shit and not referencing that.    I remember all that delicious Tohko suffering.    五河士道. Five is there, but that is a red herring since that is not his birth name. So if we go with the original 崇宮士道 we get 士 from the name and 十一 put together make his real number which is 11.    It was even more surprising how some Tohkafags thought the rape jokes were real.    Eden was an alternate space the engulft the city    No     That imagesize   &gt;archive filename confirms it Holy fucking shit, it's tohka bump limit retard       After seeing it for the three hundredth time it's hard to tell if anon is failing to be funny or shitposting.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127191422  This spoiled the volume for me unironically when I came here    Not amount of suffering can save Kurumi from his fate, changing her past is the only way.     mfw all those butthurt retardfags dropping the series every thread  Hilarious     Did you enjoy all the suffering in this volume?    I was expecting Kotori suffering to be honest, now there is no chance for her to go inverse.    then that's what Tachibana will do   Color anon where?  Coloring for this when?     it was Delicious     swimsuit theighhigh combo  my dick is destroyed     I doubt he will use the same method to save Kurumi, especially when Kurumi is the one who used it on Shidou.   I want to invert Tohka's anus, if you know what I mean.   I don't follow    Personally, I found the whole thing funny with those naive Tohkafags falling for such obvious bait.     prolapse is my fetish  m-me too     Retard.    Get the fuck out, Houkifag.     I only come for summary threads .    yeah I agree with you there it will be different, but Tachibana will find away this im certain of.  much hype for those volumes       In the end that paste managed to fulfill it's purpose, drive secondaries away from 2nd season threads.   Sisters harem when?   She got two kisses and you are still complaining? That's being greedy like Tohka.   Why does DAL have no tits in it. Have you guys seen how hot Shinmai maou is? Jesus christ why was DAL so prude by comparison  So /a/, who is the lewdest DAL?   How can you have a harem with only two girls?    Instead of vaginal sex, I'll stick it in her pooper.  Eww ew, no ew. I rather stick it in a blender or Char than to touch her.      You posted her    Don't reply to anything with "houkifag"  Because DALs are not exhibitionists      Retard    Nah, episode 1 did everything. Even the subbing groups dropped DAL.    Anything with Houki in it should be an automatic trigger of any sane person.     I was actually going to say it was Shido. Just look at this filth.     Wrong audience.    If she was trying to seduce me, she just succeeded.    But she was stopped 6 short of the deserved number    and that case you should post Tohka who is always asking for holding hands.    She didn't deserve those kisses, Tohka is greedy and needs to learn some manners.    I think she prefers pats  Yoshino!     Miku is worst girl   She got lied to. I say she deserves it.  She's still a retard though: she should have asked for those when they're all alone with no possibility of anyone disturbing.      Retard    I don't even like Tohka that much, but I'd pet her head.  And water is wet. Your point?       I think she prefers pats  All the girls do. Kurumi asked for head patting as payment for fighting Miku. Well that or sucking his blood.      She got lied to  What?    Yoshino deserves more kisses!   Spoilered for your safety.    It's a pretty reasonable request actually.    what the fuck is wrong with that thumbnail?    We need at least three sisters to call it harem.     being this much of a newfag     Not really, Tohka is jealous and wants more kisses yet still demans Shidou must no kiss the others.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=i_4<wbr>SrmKaCx4</wbr>  [ ]   Shiori in beautiful astral dress when?   Retard    It's past your bed time, Tohka.    Shidou lied to Tohka    No, she actually never said he can't kiss the others. In fact she acknowledged her mistake in making an unreasonable request. As a repayment for him technically breaking their promise though the number of kisses could be equalised for her. Very reasonable request.    I wonder how he will save Kurumi because I can't think a way to save her.    When?    No idea, I saved the image a few times over in different file types to reduce the size. Posted this and got that thumbnail. I thought 4chan was fucking up, but it turns like that every time I post it.     agreed he wouldn't kiss others   did it anyway      When he didn't tell Tohka how spirits are sealed.    Are you serious? Do you even remember the reson Tohka asked for the kisses in the first place? It's because Shidou "broke" the promise with Tohka in volume 2 even though he never agreed.    Kissing her after she fails in her mission and Inverses. Shido uses Kotori's halberd to burn out City of Devouring Time while Natsumi conceals him and Origami beamspams the clones.    Also     I want her to be saved  ;_;      he never agreed  Wrong. He did agree.     but he never lied to Tohka. She saw how he kissed Kotori and Origami and knew Shidou had to kiss Yoshino to save her.     Origami beamspams the clones.  It's far easier to just impale them on ice, as seen on Vol 6 or 7, I don't remember.     He can't use the halberd so the best he could do on that front is transform the sword into the halberd.    I'm a bit surprised how initiative she is to be honest. Tohka always strikes me as the type to be more embarrassed about those things.    She's a clone murderer and deserves to die.     Very reasonable request.  She's not accounting for all the kisses the other spirits would deserve as well.     I don't think she was ever told Yoshino had to be kissed. And she never saw those two or she would have spoken up about shidou not keeping the promise he agreed to    I think you are missing the part where Shidou has to find a way to get the old Kurumi back and that's not all, he also has to convince her she can live a normal life but Kurumi doesn't even want that.    Nigga plz    Was that ever stated? I mean, it'd be a horrible idea because it turns you into a raging berserker, but it's got to happen eventually.  Plus fire is super effective against Kurumi.   Yeah probably, but Kurumi's got that shadow power, so I think Metatron's probably got a type advantage. Or maybe they'd cancel each other out. Hard to say, but while Zadkiel and Metatron are both good at crowd control Yoshino just isn't vicious enough.  Thank god. Her Inverse is going to be worse than Nightmare.           I don't think she was ever told Yoshino had to be kissed  That's the main reason she asked for a kiss in Yoshino's arc.     Oh right. My bad.  Still she acted like she didn't know the kiss was important and that he kissed all the spirits. She probably genuinely didn't know what was happening.  And so we are back to that. Shidou didn't explain that he needed to kiss them to Retard. See  trail of posts.         mfw that new OVA  Holy shit     HE the author is literally god of this universe he will make it work   I want her to be saved ;_;   me too         Thank god. Her Inverse is going to be worse than Nightmare.     but that's not lying, Shidou never denied the fact he kissed other girls, he just didn't tell Tohka and probably assumed she knew.    but he always try to find a different way to save the girls, I even thought he was saving the time travel card for Kurumi's arc.    That's where mission failure comes into the picture. If she can't kill Spirit 1, (or if doing it sets off the spacequake) she goes into despair since all the awful things she did were for nothing. See Wakfu, Nox. The difficulty after that is stopping her from suicide or cracking the world as Inverse Nightmare. The trick to that should be rooftop Kurumi's memories and getting real Kurumi to take them. Here's hoping that one of the remaining spirits has memory powers.   Something like that yes, except worse because Yoshino is cute.       The only Angel he can physically manifest is Sandalphon's Sword(since he can't manifest the chair). The rest of the Angels seems to manifest as additional abilities like Miku's Voice, Natsumi's tranformation, Yoshino's water manipulation, Twins' wind powers, Origami's light powers and Kotori's healing flame. So henceforth if he wants to use the other Angels physical forms, he has to transform Sandalphon into them. That's why I think his true Angel would be a Sword itself.    More like he danced around it and hoped she never found out  “......That promise, did you properly keep it?”    “Th, that, this is......”    Shidou did not reply, he started to stutter.    It was understandable. In order to seal the power of the spirits kissing is essential.    How would Tohka react to that, she looked over with a long face and surprised eyes.    “......This won’t do. We’ve made a promise. That......you see, if I’m here, we can do it now?”                I don't think a few of happy memories is enough to overcome the fact she has killed 10000+ people for nothing. It would be a cheap way to save Kurumi.    I feel like she will have to live with those deaths the rest of her life as payback but shido will help her cope with it    Except I remember he summoned the Kaleidostick to make himself younger during Origami's arc.  I think he summons the most obvious aspect of a given Angel to accomplish the task at hand. He COULD do the rest, but he's not at the level where he can visualize it, passive abilities notwithstanding.      Not that guy but that doesn't even prove he cannot use other weapons, it just means he only uses the word when fighting is needed.      He already did that in Origami's arc but carrying the burden of 10000+ deaths is too much for a girl who wants to live a normal life.     we can do it now?  this damn kiss slut    Hopefully this Mio girl will have a good personality, I don't want another Miku or Natsumi.   I kind of want some tsun    so then another alternative would be canceling out those deaths to were they never even happened  the more I think about it the more I wonder what the author has planned for for her sealing it an't going to be easy.      Kotori already fits that role.     Yeah, it's going to suck for her if she actually wants a redemption arc. How does anyone make up for 10,000 deaths? Is it just a matter of trying and hoping to live a good life?  I mean, I'm sure I'll be disappointed by the answer they end up giving us, but it's a fascinating question.       That would require time travel but with Kurumi going inverse they can't ask her for help.    The more tsun the better anon, tsun is always welcome    Haniel can copy any Angel.  I'm kinda curious how negative Natsumi would have to go to use it like that again though.       Another alternative is if Shidou pays the price in Kurumi's place.     Just checked the chapter that has him use Natsumi's powers for the first time. It was mental use, no kaleidostick here. I think he can only do Sword since if he summons the other Angels physically it kinda takes away the impact and uniqueness of that Angel to the spirits not to mention that the only thing that Tohka can give to him is either the Sword or the Chair and I think that the Chair is tied to Tohka herself. Same with the other physical manifestations of the Angels to Spirits themselves.    maybe she accidentally erases her own past?    Fuck no    The copy is a weaker version of the original iirc, I don't even know if he can use that.    That would be more shido's style then letting her suffer    then she would disappear like Rinne.    What if Kurumi manages to paradox all the Spirits, except her Inverse Form and Shido?  So all the Spirits are normal people who don't know Shido at all, but Kurumi's still rampaging and Shido still has the sealed power. Holy shit that would make for an amazing arc.   I also like your idea that's she's personally destroyed her own timeline.         Yeah but how big must be the price to pay for Kurumi's actions   M-Mana will become relevant right   You can have Natsumi then, she is a bit Tsun after all.    Sure    Mana must be saved so even if she doesn't become a spirit, she still will get some relevance.    No    What?    it certainly would turn everything on its head.     most of his power and sanity and all of her power but she stays Human since she has a physical body        Yes.    Hopefully fucking not. We have our imouto already      Losing his powers? I doubt that can happen but his sanity is a different story.    and is called Mana    Kotori pls    I meant like how Kurumi used the raw power inside him to power the time travel. so he doesn't lose the abilities just the fuel for them    How? Some girls were not even human.    The spirit mana inside Shidou also belongs to the girls.

How do Zerofags exist? I don't get it. It boggles the mind. Every fight in Zero feels like something from Naruto (He caught his sword and used it to deflect the other one!), and the plot is like a less mature version of Fate but with Heaven's Feel for an ending. This is ignoring that Zero is full of shitty CGI.  Even after Ufotable decided to remake UBW into the same sort of adaptation as Fate/Zero, Zerofags manage to actually bitch about UBW and how it isn't as "smart" or "mature" as their shitty spinoff.      Fatefags constantly stress how Shirou is a broken person, how he literally can't live without trying to save everyone   "lol nevrmind, here's a chick that he wants to bang so throw all of that out of the window"   Great characterization       Well, I look forward to the "solution" of all this without Shirou killing anyone, even the "bad guy".   I haven't even touched on how unoriginal and unemotional of a bad guy Gilgamesh has become.      Abandoning his ideal in HF literally ends up with him slowly killing himself.    Shirou doesn't kill anyone in UBW. It's the only route where he doesn't kill anyone. I don't really get what you mean.     Reminder that Shirou was fully prepared to kill Shinji to stop Rider's ritual in Fate route Reminder that Shirou was fully prepared to kill Tohsaka to protect Taiga from Caster in UBW His ideal that everyone should be saved is just that: an ideal, that he knows is beyond his or anyone else's ability to fully realize. It's only in Heaven's Feel where the continuous threat that Sakura develops into means that he has to fully confront the conflict of his ideals, and to him that means either wholly embracing them or abandoning them.       Ok, so is he gay for Guts or what?   It's pretty evident in the manga. He never had any romantic interests at all.    Yeah I'm sure he was rock hard thinking of being a cripple while she fed him soup. You people are fucking bonkers.     And the thing disproving the kid being Griffith's is his physical state in the flashback.  And why should be Guts'? His conversation with Casca basically implies he'll go on his journey alone because Casca has to look after Griffith. They're basically saying they can't be together anymore.  Griffith heard this. And then he had the dream. With Guts away and Casca's kiss, is obvious the kid is his. And we don't know if he was crippled enough to not being able to have kids (unless they said they cut his genitals, in which you'd be 100% correct).       Sure, and the perfect time he chose to show he can still dominate someone is right after he confirmed Guts and Casca are a couple.  Nothing to do with jealousy or anything. He just wanted to feel in power again. Casually after overhearing them being romantic.      Well if he was homo for guts no doubt he wanted guts to want him, not just to put his penis in guts' bag   I found this:  http://www.kaga-create.co.jp/saki/i<wbr>ndex.html</wbr>    Years.  Good luck, anon.      I like how she comes into focus towards the end.   Riichi Ippatsu Tsumo vs. open Tanyao  Which is more annoying when you have yakuman tempai?     Riichi Ippatsu Tsumo, unless it's open Tanyao dora 3.     AI Mahjong   Start in North Seat   Get Chiihou tenpai, get hype as fuck   Suddenly, West scores a Renhou from South's discard   Well, actually the game doesn't recognize Renhou so the winning hand was actually a plain tanyao but still.   And I never played AI Mahjong ever again         Why are his hands and arms wrapped.    Sasuke just having sex with Karin is a much simpler explanation than trying to make sense of why Sasuke or Sakura would ask for Karin's help in conceiving a child.      Sasuke just having sex   simple explanation      I don't think it would take more than one or two panels to explain Karin having their material.  You helped us deliver the baby and without you here Sakura would die, please keep Sarada's umbillical cord as a memento of our appreciation to you.      Sasuke having sex or even a sex drive is plain wrong. I can sort of buy him doing his duty to the clan enough times to conceive a child, but not much more. With a barren Sakura on the one hand, and a ridiculously loyal weirdo who'd do anything for him, what is he to do?      A popular writer in a Japanese publishment writing a story for little boys in which a good character with a wife goes away and has sex with another woman is quite hard to explain. </blockquote>]
