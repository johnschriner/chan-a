[ Biyori Ch. 39 TL is out.  <br>Nobody takes Kanbara seriously.</br>  <br>technology!</br>  <br>Kyaputen needs help.</br>  <br>This... is.... SPARTAAAAA!</br>  <br>Luddite moe.</br>  <br>Who closed the door?</br>  <br>Koromo closed the door.</br>  <br>Hisa stop seducing kyaputen you whore.</br>  <br>Skype can't replace training camp.<br>The End.</br></br>  <br>Kana take your Ritalin already.</br>  <br>July 17 = next Saki chapter<br>July 25 = next Shinohayu/Biyori chapters, plus the three manga volume releases and Biyori OVA</br></br>  <br>I want to defile the Hayaya.</br>  Yue is on the volume 4 Shinohayu cover.  <br>The uniform look too big on her.</br>  <br>She's a small girl.</br>  <br>Do real life girls dress like that too?</br>  <br>For Mu.</br>  <br> Buchou's Story 2 <br><br>When was 1? I feel like I missed it.<br><br>Kyaputen a cute though</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sometimes, but it's not as good.</br>  <br><br>I want to see Hisa giving lessons to Mihoko.</br></br>  <br>What kind of lessons?</br>  <br>It was Chapter 3. I totally forgot about it.</br>  <br>I still don't really understand what the implication of that picture was.</br>  <br>Ok yeah, I remember it now that I've gone back and looked at a couple pages<br><br>But holy shit, what a forgettable chapter</br></br></br>  <br>Saki Biyori is cute and well drawn, but it's all kind of forgettable.<br>I wish the effort could be focused more on the main series.</br></br>  <br>All kinds.<br><br><br>I don't understand what you can't understand.</br></br></br></br>  ded thread          Right, this thread has gone to the freaks. Time to abandon it.  <br> grade school </br>  <br>Be sure to drink milk and rub twice daily<br>Actually getting someone else to rub them for you is better because you don't have to work your shoulders.</br></br>  <br>No really, do the covers depict their high school designs?</br>  <br>Yes because once upon a time Shinohayu was going to be about high school and the interhigh 10 years ago but now we're stuck in Endless Elementary.</br>  <br>I think we'll get a Shinohayu time skip through middle school. Something like: "... and Shino kept winning every tournament ... but still her mom didn't come back."<br>Then we'll get a Shinohayu plot bombshell at the same time that reporter Nishida reveals Saki and Teru's background in the main series.</br></br>  <br>We can only hope.<br>Can someone remind me what scholarship Shino and her crew wanted? Was it to a middle school?</br></br>  At some point, Shino and her mom might not even recognize each other. It would be sad if they just passed each other walking down the street, though that's unlikely to happen living so far apart.  <br>Asakumi High School<br>Shino has her act together, so I wonder why she doesn't try to go to Tokyo herself to look for her mother. Hayari already went there solo for Mafuka's concert, and Shino has old friends she could stay with. Guess she's smart enough to stay away from dealing with the yakuza.</br></br>  Posting this every thread until the vita game trailer is released.<br>Please look forward to it</br>  Why didn't Akado take some of the Achiga children to the elementary school individual tournament?  <br>Especially since she had been in it herself.</br>  <br>Is that Yuu and Kuro?</br>  <br>Yes, those are the baby Achigas.</br>  <br>Man that's sad thing to say to any parent figure. Guess we'll be seeing a lot of tears when Shino move away from Richardson<br><br> Usagi Drop ending never <br> Shino being RichardsonxShinomom daughter never </br></br></br></br>  <br> implying it's not going to be a Kanna x Richardson end with Kanna being smug all over Shino </br>  <br>Asakumi is a dorm school, so Shino only has middle school left to be with Richardson. It will be sad seeing them separate. It's also weird that we don't see the grandparents or any other aunts, uncles, or cousins. <br>Shino is so alone in the world without Richardson.</br></br>  <br>Maybe not totally alone.</br>  <br>Shino is the Kevin Bacon of mahjong.</br>  <br>Akado connects to Nodoka.</br>  <br>...and Nodoka connects to Saki.</br>  <br>I think because she was still scared from Sukoyan and didn't want to expose the children to such monsters.<br><br>Or she asked but the parents denied it.<br>"I will take your daughter to Nara to the prefectural tournament. We will stay there for a few nights, gufufu. Wait, I meant days."</br></br></br></br>  <br> The city of Kyouka <br><br><br>Those are their highschool versions nigga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it's not like Saya can write the main story, so it's probably not hurting anything<br><br>what's she gonna do, dance erotically to keep Ritz's energy up?</br></br></br>  <br>No, that would just distract Ritz and cause more delays.</br>  <br>Igarashi's art sure has gotten better. <br><br>What's the opinion on old Ritz style? They're both good but the new one is way more iconic.</br></br></br>  <br>Why does it look like a shitty shoop?</br>  <br>Because we don't have a full picture yet.</br>  久！'s figure just released. <br>To the other anons that bought her I hope she turns out well.</br>  <br>Does it smell like semen, just like the real Hisa?</br>  <br>The new one is softer looking, particularly when colored.</br>  Just a reminder that's it July already and that Yuan will have her birthday tomorrow (well, in 8 hours in Japan).  Are they close or are they distant? <br><br>A kid shouldn't say something like this.</br></br>  <br>Shino is just extremely mature for a kid.</br>  I was thinking we should make a tier list ranking the quality of each match.<br>Yes or no? I'm sure that we can come up with a consensus  except for Monkey Magic vs The supernova <br>Would it include matches other than Nagano's finals/ Side A semis/ Side B's Quarter and Semis?</br></br>  <br>Would not... other matches were like.... just one or two hands.<br><br>Ah, there's Nanpo vs Saki, I think.</br></br></br>                <br>Aww.<br>Though I thought they were going to bond over their shared love of snacks and  beating  Saki  at mahjong. </br></br>  Awai, do you think love can bloom even on the Mahjong table?  <br>Provided it's sturdy enough to support your hefty ass~</br>  <br>If love can bloom there, it can surely die there as well.</br>  <br><br>Video chat, also useless in Japan.</br></br>  Remember: some old man in the sky isn't deserving of your worship, shekels are.  <br>I-I don't think I like rapist Awai very much.<br><br> Un Surprisingly, I think I like murderous classy Teru a lot more.</br></br></br>  <br>Rather than a threat, caution is urged. Sorrow and joy are oft bedfellows.</br>  <br><br>Yes. And so are Saki and Teru.</br></br>  <br>Teru isn't a murderer, she's the greatest philosopher of our time.</br>  <br>more like the greatest sweet tooth of all time</br>  <br>Yet sometimes sweets can be anything but...</br>      The thing about life, is you need to take what you want, because nobody is going to give it to you.  To all things there is a season, and the season of blooming is a season that harbingers a season of reaping.  <br>I suddenly feel the urge to give my soul over to Saki-san</br>  <br><br>Savoring it will be a delicious treat.</br></br>    <br>I'm willing to buy it, where did you buy it and how much did you pay in ships if you are living in Europe?</br>  <br>http://www.amiami.com/top/detail/de<wbr>tail?gcode=FIGURE-010561&amp;page=top%2<wbr>Fsearch%2Flist%3Fs_keywords%3Dhisa%<wbr>24pagemax%3D40%24getcnt%3D0%24pagec<wbr>nt%3D1<br><br>I live Australia and it was about 61 dollarydoos with the cheapest shipping.</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Forty?

It would really change the whole dynamic of the game. <br><br>I remember it was a strategy used in Tetsuya and they pretended to angrily scatter their tiles at the end of a hand to avoid being caught.</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xH2<wbr>J-Ghzu3E</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I forgot how cool Teru's theme was.</br></br>  <br>Teru's theme is literally just called Teru Miyanaga on the OST.<br>There's only one other character who is that terrifying and demonic to have song named after them. That person is  Aislynn Wishart. </br></br>  <br>i can't accept this<br><br>nobody respects sheepfuckers<br><br>http://worldmapswithout.nz/<br><br>kiwi please go and stay go</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's kind of weird. Her theme is all combative and stuff, when Teru is really just a nice girl that likes playing mahjong. I don't think we've ever seen her get outright angry yet.<br>You could make the argument that she scares the panties back on to the people she plays against, but that's less her deciding that she wants to terrify some people today, and more just a byproduct of her dominance.<br>Compare and contrast with Awai, who cheerfully tries to go against sure win hands and seems to love the struggle at the mahjong table.</br></br></br>  <br>That is pretty hilarious. <br> A-chan draws depiction of NZ's relation with the world </br></br>  <br><br>Wait, did Gonzo draw this?

Saki is still in the club but doesn't play in competitions. <br>Maho's friend would be the successor to Mako.</br></br>  <br>There are subs for the ova ?</br>  <br> with Nodoka being the captain as a third year. <br>Not Nodoka, Yuuki.</br></br>  <br>But then it would be a taco club.</br>  <br>They already used that gag with Wahaha.</br>  <br>I say that because Yuuki was the president in middle school.</br>  <br><br>I predict that Maho will be the last person left in a world of ashes as she was the only one able to survive the frightful confrontation.</br></br>  <br>Poor Ritz, she drew 10 new pieces of art including the cover of the limited edition.<br><br>4 new pages in volume 14?

They're already the 2 mainest characters of the series in the first place and we know them very well. We won't be having any shortage of Saki and Nodoka scenes in the series at all. The Individuals thus should have been an opportunity to have lesser known interesting characters of the first cast to get the spotlight- yet it was so only for Kyaputen.<br>I'm not even mad because Hisa got rekt with just a single point between her and Saki. Touka, Kana, Jun, Yuuki, Momo; literally any other duo would have been better than MC1 and MC2. Would have been an interesting element of realism too, since IRL it's like Washizu said: there are times where everything is meaningless and you will lose no matter how talented you are and how well you play.<br><br>Also the South Wind girl was just unnecessary. Saki beating her was even more unnecessary, it was the golden opportunity to have Yuuki in a showdown, but instead it was just "dude rinshan lmao" again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I recognize that pattern.<br><br>Nodoka on the left again, right?<br><br>What does this mean? That Ritz misses the boobs from the vice captain match. And Megan will advance, since Arata and Seiko will satisfy her... nope, not a chance.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The way I rationalized it was: Yumi, Momo and Touka were going in with the mindset of "I must win this tournament so we can stay together / go to Tokyo to have fun together". It was important for them to realize that even if they lose, they can still be together / go to Tokyo.</br>  <br><br> It didn't strike me as much as this the first time I watched it, but wasn't the Individual tournament just plain shit overall? <br><br>It was thrown-in filler content that made little sense, and barely acted to give some context to Saki, to Mihoko, and to South-Wind Girl.<br><br>Think of it as Fanfic.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Who is the cutest Saki of them all, and why is it Shino?  <br>Shino it is</br>  Kanna is disappointed again!  Shino is popular...  shino a shit<br><br>she's not even cute</br></br>  <br><br>I bet you think that Goth Girl is better!</br></br>  <br>nah shes ugly</br>  When thinking of Kazue Nanpo and her South Wind, does anybody think of her farting?  Why are the most evil also so cute?  <br>WIth the eye ribbon and bandaged arms, it seems like she is hiding an injury.<br>She reminds me of the burned girl in Katawa Shoujo.</br></br>  <br>They should have made Yuuki's power the South Wind from the beans on all of those tacos.<br>Gotta make that cape fly in the breeze.</br></br>  <br>No wonder only 3 new chapters in the last 3 months.

Sailor Moon is gay, watch good anime faggot          Yayyyy I just started rewatching the series and I'm loving it. I watched the English dub as a kid and therefore missed out on a lot of episodes.

The animation especially is better than a ton of modern shows, it was rarely off model or choppy unless for effect.  <br> no pic <br>What a lazy reply</br></br>  <br>I'm staying here, thank you.</br>  <br> that hand on usagi's thigh and boob <br><br>Sailor Moon should had been yuri.</br></br></br>  <br>The animation is bad, the still images are bad, the writing is bad.<br>Just read the manga, watch the first anime, or watch PGSM (the live-action show).<br><br>For the love of god, anything but Crystal.</br></br></br></br>        Why is there never any love for Mercury?  <br>What a qt</br>  <br> Worst planet </br>  I don't think I'm ever going to finish the TV series. I can't bring myself to continue a series with Chibiusa in it.  <br>She was far and away the most popular in Japan.</br>  <br>Every Sailor Moon thread needs more Iron Mouse.</br>  <br>I'm the same, but add Rei and the constant will-they-or-won't-they with Mamoru to the mix. I don't know how you guys handled it - I much prefer how in the manga, Usagi and Mamoru just stuck together even when things got shitty.</br>  <br>B-but anon...</br>    <br><br>Chibi Usa isn't even that bad. She is a brat who actually gets told off and mocked often. And if you dislike her that much, just skip Sailor Moon Super S. In R, S and Stars she's just one character of dozens.<br><br>She's not even in the best season at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br> prefer the manga <br><br>faggot</br></br></br>  <br>The sailors look so beautiful in the manga</br>  Usagi is a close second to Rei  Bumping with best girl.<br>I can't believe I'm rewatching the old series again. It's really that good. I just randomly jumped to an R episode and lo and behold, I'm at S.<br><br>I've been interesting in Utena, was it? Does it have the same vibes as Sailor Moon?</br></br></br>    <br><br>Utena is a completely different show in a completely different genre. It's only similar to Sailor Moon in the Black Rose arc. Which actually is when the show started going downhill.</br></br>    <br>Either way, it's been in my backlog for years.<br><br><br>I had the full opening from the Sailor Senshi Playground long ago. Great place.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You just dont understand</br>  <br>The only good thing about Utena is pic related.</br>  <br> They all look horrible in the manga </br>    <br> I've been interesting in Utena, was it? Does it have the same vibes as Sailor Moon? <br>I love it, but it's not at all like SM. It's much moodier and there's very little levity to it. The drama of it can feel goofy at times, though.</br></br>  <br>This is now a Chuuu thread!</br>  <br>The series needed more Iron Mouse</br>    <br> filename </br>      <br>Why does she have flippers?</br>  <br>DAT chibi butt<br><br>And that guy had the nerve to call the manga Seras ugly.</br></br></br>  <br>That wasn't just a casual glance either. She was fucking examining that shit.</br>  Chuuuuu~  <br> I can't believe I'm rewatching the old series again. It's really that good. <br><br>Sailor Moon is one of the most rewatchable series there is, because it not only has a grand operatic scope, but it doesn't rely on shocking the viewer with surprise twists in order to be compelling. On top of that, having already seen it means you can just skip the parts you really don't like.</br></br></br>  <br> Just don't watch it for the plot. <br><br>I don't think there's anything I could disagree with more  in all possible senses . The plot and backstory are awesome.</br></br></br>    <br> The Rei who isn't a blatant manhater is an unbearable bitch <br><br>Go jerk it to Naoko somewhere else.</br></br></br>  <br>Nezubros for life</br>  <br>Is this from Stars?</br>  <br> that tublr nose <br>God I am so fucking sick of that shit. Artists, pls STAHP.</br></br>      <br>How is it that we have images like this, but no doujins of all the Scouts having hot lesbian orgies?</br>  <br>Japs don't like yuri.</br>  Sailor Mars was my childhood crush.<br><br>I remember secretly watching Sailor Moon and reading the manga as a young 11 year old just to admire Sailor Moon's beauty.<br><br>I'd do it in secret because my friends would think I was a wuss for liking Sailor Moon.<br><br>Sad that she's actually a bitch. What a waste for such a beautiful girl to be a cunt in terms of personality. But damn she is a looker. Idealized Asian beauty.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Daily reminder that they were all 14  <br>Daily reminder that there is nothing wrong with finding 14 year olds attractive.</br>  <br>Daily reminder</br>  <br>I'm sorry, what?</br>  <br>M-O-O-N that spells Mercury</br>  <br>This is a bad opinion. Utena gets better as it goes. Though, in comparison to Sailor Moon, the first season most closely resembles it in tone.</br>  Instead of a great remake with Raita designs we got that pile of shit called sailore moon crystal.<br><br>I'm still mad.</br></br>      <br> that man face <br>barf</br></br>  <br>I disagree. Rei is true best friend tier.</br>  <br> nanami will never be your imouto <br>feels tragic</br></br>  <br>No matter how many times you call Mars a bitch, its never going to be true</br>  Old Sailor Moon had the best reaction faces.    <br>Is it wrong I like OG Anime Usagi over Manga/Crystal Usagi cause she was a pig and I dig chub?</br>  <br>Its not wrong, but it is wierd.<br><br>Is it wrong if I self insert as Yuuichirou?</br></br></br>        <br> I like OG Anime Usagi <br><br>I too like Original Gangsta Usa-G dawg<br>You should check her together with Dr Rei up in they new hit single "Still R.E.I"<br>Peace nigga</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Its still Rei day nigga </br>  Am I searching the wrong terms, or is the Stars season just barely seeded, or batched?  <br> And if you dislike her that much, just skip Sailor Moon Super S <br>Nigga, Chibiusa is very amusing in Super S, and I don't even like her as much as I like the senshi. Her interactions with Usagi too. SuperS is actually great and underrated.<br>And what the fuck with people complaining about animation is SM, seasons 3-4 look great for it's age(haven't watched season 5 properly yet).</br></br></br>  <br> Raita sailor moon designs <br>I didn't know how much I wanted this until now. Are there more of these?</br></br>  <br>Not him, but she was the worst part of Super S.<br>Putting her in the transformation animation, and with the final kill animation, with Moon basically guaranteed she would have to be relevant every single episode.<br><br>She isnt awful, but she is the worst sailor scout, and force feeding her every episode got annoying real quick.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Double henshin is my favorite after the first season one.</br>  <br>I like the sword part with Moon, but thats about it.</br>              <br>I need that whistle.</br>  <br>It's from the first season. More especifically, it's from that episode where Usagi goes to a princess school</br>  <br>Actually, SuperS is the closest season to Utena's tone because it was directed by Ikuhara, Enokido was in charge on the series composition and for a schedule issue, nobody on the staff knew what was going on so Ikuhara got the chance to add more of his bizarre humor, surreal imaginery, sexual innuendos and his favorite subject, the posibility of staying as a child forever even if it implies to be locked on a coffin.</br>  <br> surreal imaginery </br>    <br>Usagi has the bigger talent now</br>      <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sk-<wbr>ssdFUGSs</wbr>  [ ]<br>Ikuhara used to be a cool guy.</br></br></br>  <br>Heresy.</br>  I've always like Tuxedo Mask but now that I'm rewatching the subbed anime I think he's becoming my husbando. I love how cheesy he is and his relationship with Usagi vs Sailor Moon (even though that's pretty cheesy too). In the English dub it just seemed like they were like brother and sister but in the sub he's a dick to Usagi like boys are to the girls they like. I never realized the age difference until now but I think that's what makes it so funny.  <br>Muh dick</br>  <br>Tell me about Tuxedo Mask!

I can't see it.  <br>It's pretty overhyped</br>  Watch a few hundred more series and you'll understand.  The giant swerve it pulled on everyone.<br>and even if that didn't happen it still would've held up on its own with its good art style.</br>  It had a lot of big time names in their production rooster, also Aniplex marketing  <br>Try to open your eyes. If you still can't see it, I'm afraid you might be blind.</br>  <br>Also, what's with all the crying and shit</br>  <br> What's so good about this show? <br>Junko and Tomohisa.</br></br>  Charlotte  <br>I don't think you understand shit</br>  People only started caring about it because of the shock value.  <br>Madoka never loved Homura according to the staff, so everyone wants to see Homura die now.</br>  <br>I thought it was a friendship thing</br>  Easy homu is the reason the show is good  <br><br>i also always saw it as friendship</br></br>  <br>Homu is best</br>  <br>It's a nice story about the homolust of one little girl, who is willing to do anything it takes to get her waifu.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127494248 <br>that's fucking brilliant, it isn't technically nudity because they're dudes</br>  I want to kiss homu  Is homu widest magica?  <br>it's bad but nothing compared to its fanbase (a small group that circlejerks about It everyday)</br>    <br><br>lesbian teenagers. that's literally the only reason why anyone cares.</br></br>  The art. That's about it.  Inu Curry  <br><br>Oh god, you've gone blind!<br><br>Quick, Wish for some eyes, Kyubey will fix it!</br></br></br></br>  <br>What if my wish was to not turn into a witch</br>  <br>Assuming that this is a serious question, it's a show that deconstructs magical girl and cosmic horror tropes (although not necessarily the genre itself, as many are quick to point out), has a lot of symbolic depth (I watched the series twice and still don't think I caught everything there is to see), has some very interesting overarching themes (although admittedly some of them are explored deeper in Urobuchi's other works), and tells a compelling story of friendship, despair, and hope (with a hint of Evangelion-esque psychological exploration, especially in Rebellion).<br><br>Additionally, the soundtrack is perfect and the art design is brilliant (even if there's QUALITY every now and again).<br><br>Overall, the series is very effective at what it does, and I think it's well-earned it's reputation.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Confirmed that Madoka never even thought of her as a friend. It was just her pitying her and being nice.<br><br><br><br>Worst, ruined the show.<br><br><br>None of them were gay, not even Homura who despite her obsession has no love in her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Then you end up raping your best friend.  <br>Madoka never loved Homura.</br>  <br>That makes make me sad</br>    <br>i love you homuhater!</br>  <br> Homu <br> Madokami <br> Kyoko <br> Mami's mamis <br> Yuki Kajiura <br> Tragedy <br> Magical girls <br> It's better than your favorite anime </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The music<br>The witch designs<br>The cute magical girls doing cute(?) magical girl things</br></br></br>  <br><br>Homura still never had a better friend.</br></br>  <br>Why? Homura doesn't deserve a friend.<br><br><br>&lt;3<br><br>Your image is shit and offensive though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is something wrong with this image. <br>Can /a/ see the error?</br></br>  <br>Yes. Homura is in it.</br>  <br>wrong. homu is actually the most correct</br>  <br>Two of the girls are missing legs.</br>  <br>Madoka's tits'are bigger than Sayaka's there? The latter of whom also seems to be missing a leg?</br>    <br>getting warmer there is a bigger error</br>  <br>Everyone deserves a friend</br>  <br>ding ding ding, you win one internet The tit sizes are all fucking wrong.</br>  <br>But Madoka is entry level tier</br>  <br><br>People jerked off a lot to deconstruction bullshit when it aired. I never saw the appeal. It's moeshit with laughable character conflicts and boring as hell.</br></br>  Reminder that Homu did literally everything wrong.  <br><br>Wrong? Try their whole appearance is terrible.<br><br>But Madoka's one visible leg...I don't know what's more deformed, Mami's tits, or that one leg.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Reminded that you will stick your dick in crazy.</br></br>  <br>Madoka was asking for it tbh. Madoka always got perfect treatment despite her power being Homuras credit.</br>  <br> Madoka was asking for it tbh. </br>  <br>Yeah, boobs are supposed to be<br>Mami&gt;Kyouko&gt;Sayaka&gt;Madoka&gt;Homura?</br></br>  <br>So is NGE, but just because you can enjoy something on an entry level doesn't mean there are things you won't understand until you're more experienced. But yes, you highlighted why Madoka is better than your favorite anime.</br>  <br>Sayaka's definitely bigger than Kyouko.<br>And Homura seems to have given herself an upgrade as of Rebellion.</br></br>  <br>That pic made me cringe.</br>  <br> things you won't understand <br> literal meguca is 2deep4u </br></br>  <br>close its mami&gt;sayaka&gt;kyoko&gt;homu&gt;mado. <br><br>homu and mado were close but in rebellion devil homu gave herself a slight upgrade.</br></br></br>  <br>Sure is, sorry I had to be the one to break it to you.</br>  who has the best witch form?  <br> Homura seems to have given herself an upgrade as of Rebellion. <br><br><br> Homura </br></br></br></br>  <br>Not that much of an upgrade<br>She still slightly classy</br></br>  <br>  flawless taste  </br>  <br>She totes was. Not a bad thing tho. I love Madokes, shes a good girl. Homura just deserved better imo.</br>  <br>Homura doesn't. She's an evil, ruinous cunt.<br><br><br>Yes!<br><br><br>Homura was nothing to Madoka. Madoka fixed her mess for her and Homura ruined it all. Homura never did anything good for anyone.<br><br><br>Homura deserved to be sborted. No one would have missed her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  Nothing.The fandom and the anime are pure shit    <br>Mami breasts are too big, Sayaka are to small, Kyouko is just about right, Madoka and Homura are too big.</br>  Cheese cannon!    Newfags tried to force it as the next Eva when it was average at best.    I don't know, I didn't watch it when it aired and I'm afraid of liking it since /a/ mostly hates it and the fans are autistic as fuck (Homuhater, Kevin, the other tripfags).    <br> I'm afraid of liking it since /a/ mostly hates it and the fans are autistic as fuck <br>That's pathetic anon.</br></br>  <br>the OTP</br>  <br>I know enough about the show to shitpost and that's all I need.</br>  <br> Homura seems to have given herself an upgrade as of Rebellion <br><br>Not hard, you can only go up from being totally shit.</br></br></br>  <br>She downgraded. She is the lowest existence in the universe. Insane, hateful, unloved, wanted dead, ugly, fucked by every man on Earth, shit. She deserves to die.</br>  <br>Hey, Homuhater isn't dead.
