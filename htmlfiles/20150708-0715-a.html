[ Time for the end of arc party and heavy exposition chapters.  And Luffy x Rebecca's engagement.  <br>God no, although I will admit I think she's joining the crew.</br>  <br> Rebecca joining </br>  <br> Rebecca won't join </br>  <br> I will admit I think she's joining the crew. <br><br>You're retarded <br><br>She has NO REASON to leave Dressrosa. Why the fuck should she hang out with pirates if her biggest ambition in life was getting her father back?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>People are finally starting to believe Rebecca will join the SH crew.<br><br><br>Her father is still young. She can live with him after she goes on an adventure with Luffy. That's what being a young girl is. She lived her whole life in a coliseum. She needs freedom, not a so-called home where she would be stuck until her forties.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be free since she's been a prisoner most of her life.</br>  <br> her biggest ambition in life was getting her father back <br>She didn't even remember him for half her life.</br></br>  I think Zoro will leave the crew soon  <br>Why? Get lost on the way back to the boat?</br>  Okay, fuckers, time to put everything into perspective.<br><br>- Law attacks Ceasar, to bring SAD down<br>- SAD gives Dofla ability to create SMILE<br>- SMILE is a manmade DF that gives you zoan powers<br>- One of yonko already has an army of SMILE zoans<br>- Law wants to fuck Ceasar, so he can fuck Dofla by bringing the yonko on him<br><br>Right now it seems like Luffy defeated Dofla, but Ceasar, the person who stood behind SAD and production of SMILE, was probably captured by another yonko - Big Mom.<br><br>So, possible clash of two yonko incoming?<br><br>Also - what's the possibility that Bepo is one of these zoan SMILE users?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>hopefully Rebecca stays put,while Leo,Manshelly and Kabu sneak aboard the ship. The healing and stitches are just too convenient .</br>  Will Law actually finish Doflamingo or will he leave it to Kaido?  <br>To avenge fell-down-some-stairs-girl.</br>   2015 <br> liking bread </br>  <br>Law sure is weird, harming a monkey over bread<br><br><br>Honestly there's too many factors because the treasure bomb will still be sent to Big Mom, we need to find out what will happen with Sanji and Co. Even if she is Lola's mum that doesn't mean she will immediately be an ally.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm really hoping next arc is a meanwhile arc of the others and has the crew from last arc away fighting Don so they get more focus and time to make up for their long absence. Then a big grand reunion.</br>  <br>The Marines already have Doffy. I doubt Law will go after him now that he's down from supporting Luffy so hard.</br>  As someone who got back into OP due to the hype around gear fourth, and reread the entirety of Dressrosa as of now, I must say it was a good arc to read through, but I honestly can't say why it was so long and what even happened over those 100 chapters, and I can't imagine waiting for two years to read all of this bit by bit.  Why does Dressrosa have so many princesses? Four in a single arc is a freaking overkill.  <br>Well, because the king had family? Not every princess is supposed to fulfill the same ltierary roll.</br>  Guys. Iceberg build a pool in Australia.  <br> Party <br> While half the crew is fighting a Yonkou <br> The weaker half <br><br>I wonder how Luffy's hunger matches up against his loyalty to his crew</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Viola has a higher chance of joining since she worked as an officer for the Doflamingo family for 10 years.</br>  So who was Spandam's backer? WG? Doffy? Kaidou?  <br>Shanks.</br>  Soon Law will be out of crews.  <br>She has zero chance of joining with being omniscient for fucking miles around.</br>  <br>Also she looks pretty much exactly like Robin.</br>  <br>That mustn't happen. Luffy will adopt him if that happens. Law needs to stay with his beloved crew.</br>  <br>but she got dem dick lips. Rebecca is a literal Nami clone and people think she has a better chance of joining.</br>  <br>Rebecca serves no purpose. Boring, weak, nothing to contribute. It would be better to have no new member at all.</br>  <br>Well they are retarded aswell.<br><br>I honestly don't know who would join at this point. Kinemon seems too, dunno, generic of a character, even though he is pretty helpful, but then he would be the third sword fighter on board.<br>The next likely would be Bartolomeo, but I don't think he would have good chemistry, and his personality gimmick would take the Sanji route of being fuck annoying pretty quickly. Plus, he has his own crew.<br><br>I think this arc won't have someone join, but rather make the Strawhats get alliances with other pirate crews of the new world.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How did a kingdom manage to be peaceful and passive for multiple centuries in the fucking New World?  <br>It's not like having a sword instantly makes you boring; a huge portion of the One Piece world uses swords, certainly more than 3/10. Kinemon can light his on fire, which is pretty cool. Different, at least. And if he ends up being a kitsune zoan user, he'd be perfect. It's not like Sanji was superfluous because Luffy already kicks things.</br>  This arc isn't about getting someone to join the active crew as much as it is building Luffy's future armada.<br><br>Though I due think we're overdue for the 9th member. It's been like seven years or something since Brook joined</br></br>  <br>I don't know. The coast guard?</br>  <br>I wish we'd focus on giving Brook some time to shine first... Maybe he'll get his own enies lobby one day.</br>  <br> It's not like Sanji was superfluous because Luffy already kicks things. <br>Not nearly as much as he punches things. How often does he even use Axe, Whip and Spear compared to his like 10 variations of Pistol?<br><br>Sanji is all about kicking from introduction</br></br></br></br>  Pica has a point here. Riku is a shit tier king  <br>Brook has had like one fucking full arc as a crewmate!</br>  <br> And if he ends up being a kitsune zoan user <br>He already has that clothes devil fruit though. A fox zoan would have been interesting though.</br></br>  <br>Zoro and Brook don't set things on fire nearly as much as Kinemon would.</br>  <br>I agree with this. Law did state that surviving in the New World means you should either be under the protection of the Yonkou or beat them. If you're going for the latter, it can't be done with a single pirate crew. Maybe this is how Luffy gets his alliances for survival?</br>  <br>Kitsune have a similar "leaf/stone on the head" disguise ability. Maybe he just doesn't understand how the transformation works, like momo</br>  <br>Cobra doesn't fight.</br>  <br> Mfw Thriller Bark was originally supposed to be before Enies Lobby </br>  So guys, what did Belammy did on Skypia?   Strawhat Candidates Likeliness <br><br> Pretty Much Confirmed But Off Doing Other Things Tier <br>Jinbei<br>Kuzan<br><br> Good Tier <br>Viola<br><br> Mid Tier <br>Momonosuke<br><br> Redundant Tier <br>Kinemon<br>Bellamy before his arrest<br><br> Shit Tier <br>Law<br>Kyros<br>All of these fucking one-off characters that are half the reason we haven't seen Sanji in two years<br><br> Deconfirmed Tier <br>Rebecca<br>Bellamy after his arrest<br>Bartolomeo AKA Barto AKA Birdykun AKA The Barrier Slamma Jamma AKA World Record Champ for Luffy Dick Riding AKA #1 Luffy Fan AKA Does he really eat people? AKA The Disciple of the Dividing Line AKA Prophet of Protection AKA The Belligerent Bastard of the Bera Bera No Mi</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kuzan </br>  <br> see that it exists <br> realize the error of his ways and begin to respect Luffy <br> steal the gold pillar because pirates gonna pirate </br></br></br>  Did she write letters to Doflamingo or something?  <br> my themesong has kashira. check it out <br>Monet - Shiroi Shokei <br>Try it.</br></br></br>  <br> speedreaders <br>Her dream growing up until today was to one day live with the toy soldier (who she now remembered was her father).</br></br>  <br> Why? Get lost on the way back to the boat? <br>I think Oda got rid of all those nasty time consuming thing like character traits and use it for far better things, like more and more characters.</br></br>  <br><br>Which route did he take to get to Skypia?</br></br>  <br> panda scans </br>  <br>There were routes other than the knock-up stream that were safer, but I don't remember what they were. But considering Bellamy was the only survivor from his crew, he may have used the stream.</br>  <br>You realize before Roger there was no great age of pirates, right? There were no Yonko, all these civilizations just existed. It was because Roger conquered the Grand Line that everyone else came into the New World and began taking countries for themselves and when that happened, Doffy took Dressrosa so they didn't survive being passive in the New World as we know it now for more than a decade.</br>  <br>How is Rebecca deconfirmed?<br>How is Bellamy deconfirmed? I mean he's more likely to join Laws crew for a new era of Donquixote pirates</br></br>  <br>New World still must have been pretty intense if only Roger ever made it to Raftel</br>  <br>Exactly, that's why nobody would have ever conquered Dressrosa, the SEAS were intense, not the lands. Nobody wanted to sail the seas and nobody had fully done so before Roger and it was thought impossible so nobody was even trying to conquer these countries.</br>  <br> Rebecca <br>"My daughter, you will never have to fight again"<br> Bellamy <br>Cause he's dead? (Not that I believe he is, though I still doubt he'll join anyone)</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bartolomeo would make the perfect cabin boy, though, Luffy needs his Shanks/Buggy if he's going to be Pirate King<br><br>And someone already explained that in Japanese culture cannibal is basically their term for troll, he doesn't eat people, he trolls them as seen in his first appearance</br></br></br>  <br> Knock Up stream either kills all or brings all up alive <br> Others routes people tend to die on the way </br></br>  <br>Who is Momonosuke?</br>  <br>A fucking piece of shit character that needs to die.</br>  <br>For the thousandth time, those were Kyros words, not Rebeccas. People still can't see that we truly havent' heard her opinion on her own nature, especially considering she went after Doffy at the end.</br>  <br> Bartolomeo would make the perfect cabin boy, though, Luffy needs his Shanks/Buggy if he's going to be Pirate King <br><br>Momonosuke.</br></br></br>  <br> Why does he wear the mask? </br>  <br>I always thought this is bullshit.<br>Of course there can people fall from the boat and die.</br></br>  <br> getting ntr'd by a fictional child </br>  <br>Are you actually retarded, all she has told Luffy in the time they were together in the Colosseum is how she dreams of one day living with the toy soldier. She never wanted to fight, he made her get stronger because he might not always be there for her. Now he is there. They will be together or Oda's a terrible (as in inconsistent) writer.</br>  <br>Didn't she herself at one point say she didn't want to fight?</br>  <br> People still can't see that we truly havent' heard her opinion on her own nature <br><br>I think we got a pretty good view of her character.<br>She refuses to directly kill anybody.<br><br>Not very useful trait for a pirate.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Good points she probably won't join after all then. Only way it's possible is if she saw herself as useless and saw the Strawhats as a way to get stronger.</br></br></br>  <br>Straw hats never kill anybody.</br>  <br>They've killed thousands of mooks.<br><br>They've not killed many named characters.<br>Not for lack of trying, just once you have a name in the world of OP, you have nearly invincible plot armor even as a secondary or tertiary character.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not that she refuses to kill, everyone does that, it's that she refuses to fight offensively or strike a person. It's like Sanji and Zoro are with women except she's like that with everyone.</br>  <br>This. Scarlet was wet over Kyros. Wouldn't surprise me that a sixteen year old would do the same.<br><br>Actually, I'd be surprised if she DIDN'T have any feeling for him. It'd be funny to have someone swoon over Luffy that's not an aging Christmas Cake(I love Boa, mind you but the age difference is grating).<br><br><br>To make her own decisions. To become an adult and to be free and live with someone who acknowledges her existence and bloodline in a good light. Do you read One Piece, nigga?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>shes so fucking weak though, what use would she be to the crew?</br>  <br>Okay, what kind of decisions would she want to make? Why would she join Luffy out of the blue? She doesn't even have a dream.</br>  <br><br> mfw if Oda was a different kind of shounen mangaka, this would be the start of a love triangle between Luffy, Hancock and Rebecca </br></br>  <br> To make her own decisions. To become an adult and to be free and live with someone who acknowledges her existence and bloodline in a good light <br>Okay so what kind of decisions would those be?<br><br>Did the citizens of Dressrosa suddenly stop not hating the Riku family now that they know what happened? Why wouldn't they view her in a good light?<br><br>You're making things up for the character that you want to see and aren't actually there</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dunno if that's even quite right, though she manages to ring out opponents in the coliseum it's not like she doesn't know she's dooming them to be fighting fish food, could rationalize it like saying a body slam isn't a direct attack, you're letting the ground do the damage. As for her thing with toy soldier, super unclear because of the whole memory shit.</br>  <br> powerlevel fags </br>  Bellamy ;_;  <br> tripfags </br>  Big Mom or Kaido?<br><br>Who will turn out to be stronger?</br></br>  <br>Her love Doffy and her sister Sugar.</br>  <br>She's a CoO user that nearly kept up with Hakuba, seemed to impress even Sabo, the overpowered fuck.</br>  <br>Why do you think Kaido is called the strongest creature in the world?</br>  <br>The point of Rebecca having CoO is to show that Haki is freaking common in the New World. Same goes for Chinjao.</br>  <br>Some bullshit I'm sure. No way he's stronger than Whitebeard or Kizaru or whatever</br>  <br> Her love Doffy <br><br>I want shipperfags to leave</br></br></br>  <br>With Oda's sneakiness, if she told her dream to Kyros or someone else before they became a toy, she may not have remembered it until very recently, but they had things to do so there's been no time to chat about it. Course that's just a guess, but an easy out if Oda makes hell anyone in this arc have a sudden desire to do something seemingly random.</br>  <br>Except no one else could dodge Hakuba. barto had to use barriers, and Robin was lucky due to her distance, if she was closer she may not have reacted on time.<br><br> inb4 speed means nothing to her, she would still have to react and use her powers </br></br></br>  <br>Big Mom will probably be the weakest of the Yonko cause shes female</br>  <br> I want shipperfags to leave <br><br>This and Rebeccafags</br></br></br>  <br> nearly kept up with Hakuba <br><br>Because getting whacked in the helmet so hard it flies off, your head starts bleeding, and fall you to the ground from shock is nearly keeping up. She couldn't even keep up with Diamante.<br><br>It was plot stupidity that Hakuba slashed everyone in their stomach or back, but only Rebecca got hit in head, the only part of her body with armor. Otherwise she jobs harder than Dellinger.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Unfortunately that will be the most likely case.</br>  <br>Think about it. Violet never really befriended anyone in the crew, he saw Baby 5 as a sister and Jora is too old. <br><br>Her being Doffy,s lover is not far fetched at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Out of all those gladiators who are supposedly big names in the new world only the Rebecca had it? Super fucking common right?</br>  <br>Whitebeard is dead though.</br>  <br> Her love Doffy </br>    <br>I'm still waiting for him and Ace to pull a desert hawkman and turn out to have survived.</br>  <br>Why aren't mono and kinemon in the same tier?</br>  <br>Rebecca's hopefully not getting in, her character arc's been wrapped up and she doesn't really contribute anything to the crew.<br><br>Bellamy would be cool to see, he's my favourite candidate, but I think he's more realistically going to join Law's crew, having a Doflamingo tattoo and all.<br><br>Viola's good, her role would make sense as a scout as well.<br><br>Mononosuke's probably going to stick around as a cabin boy.<br><br>Barto and the rest of the side characters are probably going to end up forming a Strawhat fleet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> it was all an act! </br></br>  <br>Bellamy needs to get rid of his "senpai notice me" complex, he's better off not joining anyone. He should remain a loner or gather himself a new crew.</br>  <br> who is whitebeard? <br> who is ace <br> who is vergo  <br> who is Monet </br></br></br></br>  <br>They don't have to join together. There's a theory that they're not even related.</br>  <br>The four dead named characters,  two of whom are alive </br>  <br><br> two of whom are alive <br><br>Yeah, Ace and Whitebeard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not going to happen, he wants to survive the great wave so the Heart Pirates or the Strawhats would be the best option for him. Or perhaps he realises that they are the great wave?</br>  <br><br><br>You really don't read One Piece, do you?<br> Prisoner due to her bloodline <br> Everyone hates her <br> Fights against her will in a stadium where her name is cursed and scorned <br> Suddenly some adventure loving simpleton comes in and shows admiration for her simply because she fed him <br> Sees that her situation was the same as Ace's, gets angry because of it, also reminds him of where he grew up in, a slum <br> Finds out Doflamingo was behind her and her grandfather's situation, wants to stop him <br> Tells her explicitly to stay near his crew, he'll take out Doflamingo <br> She wants to do her part, but Kyros and Viola say otherwise, telling her what they want her to do <br> Luffy unsurprisingly keeps to his word, takes out Doflamingo, she runs to his side, cries over him excessively <br><br>Source, the fucking manga. I'm sick of you people</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That doesn't say anything, she's still useless.</br></br>  <br>Violet can see everything going on for a huge radius around her, would spoil Luffy's fun too much, really she's like a weird spinoff of Otohime who could geel her subject's distress, Violet can see it.</br>  <br>So? She likes Luffy like everyone he's ever fucking met. He helped her. That does't change the fact that for the first time in a decade, she has a happy home and a loving family to return to. A much better alternative than being liability tits on a pirate crew with much better alternative options in this arc alone</br>  <br>So you want Luffy to accept her out of pity? I'm sick of you.</br>  I'm going to be the next Strawhat Pirate crew!<br><br><br>Can't wait to see Nami's tits!</br></br></br>  <br><br>Noice.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, u jelly?<br><br><br>I'm gonna take #selfie with Luffy and Zoro after I finish packing up and settle down in Thousand Sunny and post it on Facebook and Twitter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He was already kind of impressed with her haki and he didn't even see the Hakuba part.</br>  <br>But kinemon has a higher chance to join. Since its canon that he's momos dad he won't let his son go on a pirate trip. Also when Shanks and buggy joined they were around 14-15 maybe even 16. When luffy wanted to join shanks denied him because he was 7. Momo is only 8. He's too young to be sailing with them.</br>  <br><br>fuk u m80, i'll shit on ur mum, pls.</br></br>  <br>I agree.</br>  <br><br>u fukin wot m8 i'll smack u in the gabber and rek ur gran m8, ye ur gran m8 I swear on me mum</br></br>  <br>Not everyone has to be a powerhouse like Zoro and Sanji. Remember Usopp? He was weak and look at how far he got. Tactics and strategy can win fights too, you know, the two things people criticize shonen series for dropping in favor of pure power? Robin doesn't fight much for a reason.<br><br><br>Same can be said for Nami. She didn't have to stay with Luffy. She had her village back. She could have stayed home and then decide to go back to map making.<br><br><br>Where did I say anything about pity? He likes her simply because she fed him and she's nice. Plus, she has skills in combat. You think fighting is all about killing and attacking. Note how when some characters joined the Straw Hats they suddenly gained a new trait or two?<br> Chopper becomes cowardly and more childlike <br> Sanji's love for women gets cranked up <br> Zoro having no sense of direction <br> Nami being a gold-digger for the sake of it and not because she wants to save her home <br>You think Rebecca's gonna stay the same? You know for a fact she'll remain 'useless' as you state?<br><br>I reiterate: You faggots don't read the manga. I bet you don't even watch the anime and just spew shit based on what other people say without even looking for a source.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nami had already been traveling with Luffy for 3 arcs previously, had a dream that involved accompanying Luffy, and had skills which would be useful to Luffy. She was also an interesting character  back then . None of these things can be said about Rebecca.</br>  <br><br>Never said powerhouse - I'm not talking about fights, I'm talking about use.<br><br>She's useless - even Brook at least has a use.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Agreed but you could have typed  a bit better. But yeah she still has room for character development, I'll be severely dissapointed if Dressrosa is the end of character completely because she never had a satisfying resolution in her character arc.</br>  Guys please stop arguing, I'm the next Strawhat Pirate crew. Being talked and praised does not make me happy at all!  <br>She'll certainly come back in some context-- One Piece is great about revisiting stuff. But she is not an interesting enough character to join the main cast. Not even close.</br>  <br> even I am not aware of it <br>So what? Didn't Spandam get the last devils fruit reference catalog like Blackbeard and Sanji?</br></br>  <br>Also Robin's dark and cute obsessions.</br>  <br><br>When will people learn</br></br>  <br>Fair enough. I'm just sick of faggots thinking every character has to fill a role to become a Straw Hat or have some insane ability to join. Usopp joined simply because Luffy considered him a friend. Luffy gives no fucks about what you can do. Brook was asked to join before he knew of his music or Laboon's relationship with him.<br><br><br>But Barto is, right? Gotta love that tired sempai gimmick, right?<br><br><br>Honestly, she could have went with someone else who wasn't a pirate. Hell, she saw what kind of person he was and still ditched him until he beat Arlong. And your spoiler brings me to ask this: If she's not interesting now, what's the harm in bringing in another uninteresting character? Hell, she looks like her, and is fairly new. Out with the old.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Rebecca thread   I wouldn't necessarily have a problem with it if they replaced Nami with Rebecca. It would still be dumb, but that would be preferable than just adding her on. But obviously Nami wouldn't get replaced, and we would have two characters on the crew who are a walking pair of tits taking up twice the time they already do now. And who the fuck was Nami ever supposed to meet in East Blue who was not a pirate, but also planning to travel to the end of Grand Line?  <br>Robin isn't a walking pair of tits?</br>  <br>B-but the poneglyphs</br>  Cool Robin.  <br><br>Silly Robin and Iceberg, guns don't kill people.</br></br>  <br>Bart is better than Rebecca, yes. He has a unique design, an interesting ability that makes him useful but not overpowered, a better developed personality even if you don't like his quirk, and some fucking reason that he would want to join the crew in the first place.<br><br>But Bart isn't even the only other option. Cavendish, Bellamy, Violet, Leo, Law, Ceasar... there are many other characters from this arc alone who would make better strawhats than Rebecca, for more than one of the above mentioned reasons. There is no redeeming quality about Rebecca that makes her a good candidate. You're basing this entirely on her liking Luffy, and the possibility that Oda will make her less boring in the future. You could say the same about Kyros. Or most of the people Luffy has ever interacted with.</br></br></br>  <br>But guns killed Whitebeard</br>  <br>Robin is the only person in the world who can read poneglyphs, has a unique and interesting personality, has an interesting devil fruit power, knows more about the world than anyone else in the crew, has a connection to the revolutionaries, has a compelling reason why she has to stay with Luffy and company, and has tits.</br>  <br> Everyone hates her <br>No one hates her.<br> Finds out Doflamingo was behind her and her grandfather's situation, wants to stop him <br>This problem is over.<br> Tells her explicitly to stay near his crew, he'll take out Doflamingo <br>So what? He wanted to protect his friend, of course he's going to want her to stay close to his crew. Doesn't mean he wants her to join.<br> Luffy unsurprisingly keeps to his word, takes out Doflamingo, she runs to his side, cries over him excessively <br>Once again, so what? Her conflict is solved, she has no reason to stay by Luffy's side. What reason would she have to travel with a group of pirates? She said herself, her dream was to live with Kyros.<br><br>And like I said before, she's weak. Just because she has Observation Haki doesn't make her an automatic candidate to join the crew. Her fighting style is boring as hell, and her personality is boring as well. What is she going to do, trip all her enemies to fall into the water? She doesn't even wield and actual sword for fuck sakes. I just can't wait for Luffy to leave Dressrosa without Rebecca to demolish you autistic rebeccafags.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Robin is my favorite christmas cake!  <br><br>Post Robin.</br></br>  <br> I bet you don't even watch the anime <br>opinion fucking discarded</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127727089 <br>Nice one, bro! Upvoted!</br>  <br>strong world robin best robin</br>  <br><br>Fuck yes.</br></br>    <br>The everyone hating them thing is kind of abstract yet seemingly how the crew fit together, they were all sort of misfits in some way in their home before the SHs, Rebecca would fit as the hated gladiator in the everyone hates her regard, but it's not like there's an official checklist.</br>  <br>Vivi had a better chance of joining. She had tits bigger than nami. She was different from nami. She could fight and probably beat rebecca. She even interacted with all the crewmembers. But rebecca has only interacted with luffy and robin. All of the strawhats that joined interacted with the strawhats that were already there. Now I know she could not see the Sanji team because they weren't there but what about zoro and ussop and franky? She hasn't said a word to them. I don't think she's even seen franky. Also after 10 years she gets to see her dad, aunt and grandpa again. Why would she leave. And by joining the crew she will have to pick up a sword and fight. Last time I read the series her dad ain't cool with that. Plus if she gets a bounty she just can't return to the island when the adventure is done. They will be risking their power by protecting her. And king riku wants what's best for the people and would not want to risk losing his kingdom AGAIN. Also she doesn't even own a personal weapon. It was broken. And what about the gladiators that were kept in the colloseum until they won 1000 battles? She hasn't even seen them to ask how their enjoying their feeedom. And luffy won't be on dressrosa for long. He might stay for a party but it will be as short as the feast they had on punk hazard which only lasted one or two hours. Also this whole dressrosa arc happened in ONE DAY. when did she have time to properly have a reunion with her dad? Or the other prison gladiators? Or the rest of the family? Luffy also can't stay on dressrosa with all the the marines around. It's just like in alabasta when tashigi and the marines helped the strawhats stop the battle between rebels and the kingdom. After that crocodile was arrested and they went back to to trying to capture the strawhats and would have succeded if it wasn't for Bon clay. So luffy doesn't have time to wait for rebecca. He hasn't invited her at all and she hasn't ever implied she wanted to join</br>  <br>All of those are reaching. Especially Caesar and Cavendish. Barto's quirk already made me dislike him and he'd be no better than Brook with his bone jokes, which people hate. You want another Brook on the crew? And he has his own crew and state in fucking 773 that he won't join. Do you read the manga?<br><br>Law the only one you get, and even then, he has his own crew as well. Viola is the princess, she can't join and her ability makes Luffy's purpose for adventure null. You'd know that if you read the manga, but you don't. Caesar is irredeemable at this point and has a connection with Big Mom and Kaidou. He's either gonna get killed or get turned in to the Marines. Bellamy, I don't think will join. He may go on a path to find himself and a new purpose.<br><br><br>All I said in that post was during the entire arc. And the rest of your post is funny. But what else to expect from faggots like you who can't string a good argument together?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm afraid I would have to disagree anon-kun</br>  <br>2 of those are not even princesses</br>  <br> Sees that her situation was the same as Ace's, gets angry because of it, also reminds him of where he grew up in, a slum <br> She wants to do her part <br>That was never said. Stop pulling things out of your ass.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think any of these people will join, Rebecca included, but Rebecca is at the bottom of the list. She serves absolutely no purpose, and you have yet to confront that in hours of shitposting. I would take a dozen extra Brooks before a shittier Nami.<br><br>But, you're just making insults now, so I'm done with actual arguments. Hurr durr you're a dumb faggot you don't read the manga etc etc You can come up with these yourself buddy</br></br></br>  <br>The first part was heavily implied when Luffy got all mad at the spectators hating her for her family ties or some such.</br>  It's unlikely, but i'd like it Caesar to join the SHs.   Doflamingo  is the next SH crew  <br>Luffy got mad because they were offending a person that was nice to him. The rest is just your headcanon.</br>  <br> All of those are reaching. Especially Caesar and Cavendish. <br><br>I don't think he meant they WOULD actually join, just that even they have a higher chance of joining than Rebecca. <br><br>Personally I don't think anyone will join this arc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Proof you don't have anymore to say.<br> Hurr you insulted me ;_; <br>Same with you. I got a life outside this shithole.<br><br><br> I don't read the manga, but I know what I'm talking about! <br><br>I'll end with this: If she doesn't join, so be it. There's way more for me to look forward to that I won't get angry and pouty over her joining. I got Jinbe coming in, and all the other world building events to follow. One little disappointment won't deter me from the rest of the story.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>but anon! Caesar has already joined the SHs</br>  <br>*over her not joining</br>  <br>Just because everyone hated her doesn't mean much. No one hates her now. Besides, only a few crew members were actually hated, or at least disliked by everyone (Franky, Usopp, Robin). I don't know what you're getting at.</br>  <br>you dont insult people that feed Luffy<br><br>He tried to kill Zoro when he thought Zoro mercilessly killed his benefactors</br></br></br>  <br>  I got a life outside this shithole. <br><br>If so why keep shit posting?</br></br></br>  <br><br> I got a life outside this shithole </br></br>  <br>That would look nice and all if it weren't for the crappily photoshopped background.</br>  <br>if he didn't do that shit with the children i'd be pretty sure that he'd be likely to become a friend at least. <br><br>anyway, he'll still be part of the next arc (maybe even next two) so it's fine, because i like him as a character.</br></br></br>    <br> I got a life outside this shithole. <br>Then leave?</br></br>  <br>Perhaps they'll keep him until they meet Vegapunk, then leave him behind as Vega's new pet/assistant</br>  Baby 5 is joining the crew, she thinks luffy said she's here to save her. And I seriously think oda has to fix her.  <br>  One little disappointment  <br>Yeah,that's why you are replying at every single post doubting her entrance in the crew. Because you clearly don't care much about her joining. I hope someone screencaps all of these posts so we can remember how retarded rebeccafags are.</br></br>  <br>Luffy being opinionated is a thing that never quite stops being a thing<br><br>that Rebecca is in his thoughts at all is because she fed him</br></br></br>   This guy will still think Rebecca will join even after they leave   <br>Please. B-5 is going to disappear with Sai, only ever to be seen again on a cover 100 chapters off<br><br>Oda isnt interested in fixing his perfect idea of a waifu</br></br></br>  <br>That is an oddly specific memory to conjure up for someone that just bought him food. But sure, don't acknowledge that confirms a detail brought up.</br>  <br>Don't worry, it's only a chapter or two more before Rebecca is confirmed gone forever</br>  <br> she thinks luffy said she's here to save her <br>She's going with Sai anon</br></br>  <br>Sai will fix her  with his dick </br>  <br> I don't care about Rebecca joining and I have a life which is why I reply to everybody who doesn't think the same way I do and have been for months now </br>  <br> for someone that just bought him food <br><br>how did you manage to type that whole sentence out and still not realize how stupid you were being?</br></br></br>  <br>How is this related to Ace or the slums,at all<br>There he's just thinking at how his grandpa is different to him but he doesn't hate him for that</br></br>  <br>Reminder that Sai will bang this now whenever he wants</br>  <br> Do you think full-boy haki makes their dick black and hard as well? </br>  <br>That lucky hideous bastard.</br>  <br>not even mad, Sai is a pretty swell guy</br>  <br>Not the one that brought that up, but it's loosely tied together, the gladiator prisoners could remind Luffy of the trash heap and slums he lived in, they're the rejects and such of the upper class and all that, and Ace was resentful of his connection to Roger because people shunned him for it or some such, though not sure if he told Luffy much of it.<br>Even those, it was already a connection Luffy felt shared I suppose for whatever it's worth.</br></br>  <br>If it was like that,Luffy would have thought of Ace and Roger,not Chinjao and Garp.</br>  <br>He still compared Dressrosa to his home country and the Grey Terminal.</br>  <br>As I said, loosely tied, and as my last statement pointed out, he still felt a connection, not sure why the original poster thought it necessary to connect that much as Luffy already seemed to feel some kinship having to read into it.<br><br>That I don't entirely recall exactly, that might have been in reference to the toys, I think. Always helps to find the page and post it so we don't have to dig so much.</br></br></br>  <br>Thinking she won't become the straw hats 1st division commander</br>  <br>Ah, found it.</br>  <br> giving her Bartolomeo's role <br><br>nah. First and Second division are reserved for Romeo and Cabbagedish. Third will go to Bellamy since it'd make him happy. Then Chinjao, the giant I forget the name of, Ideo, then Blue Gilly, Abdullah and Jeet, then maybe uh.. Duval, then Moocy<br><br>Gatz will be honorary, Kyros will be the rich uncle who sends the SHs checks for ridiculous amounts of Berries. Rebecca gets to lick the stamp. Maybe.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can someone remind me again, what the point of him as hostage was?</br>  <br>No, re-read Punk Hazard and it's ending</br>  <br>Caesar is Doffy's pet cashcow (or goat, whatever)<br><br>he's needed to make Smiles. Smiles being the only thing keeping Kaido's dick out of Doffy's asshole</br></br></br>  <br>Bellamy can go searching for the meaning of life, Barto can keep fapping to Straw Hats on his ship, and Rebecca can go suck her father's dick for all I care. Caesar is the nakama we need!<br> a long-awaited Logia with a unique fighting style <br> scientist, which makes him useful <br> has a dream, to become the world's best scientist <br> has chemistry with Straw Hats <br>Just you wait, Caesar will repent, and then Luffy will forgive him and invite him in the crew.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Will there be a Luffy x Vivi and Luffy x Shirahoshi engagement too?</br>  <br>Think about it, Luffy can actually satisfy Shirahoshi thanks to Gear 3 and 4.</br>  <br>Doffy seems to have a normal relationship with the other Yonko (Big Mom probably unaware Ceasar is his subordinate), even providing Whitebeard's medicine.<br><br>Why does Kaido have a stick up his ass when it comes to the man who created his SMILE army?</br></br></br>  <br>perhaps Big Mom is Whitebeard's female equivalent and is generally a chill person(for a pirate who eats people)<br><br>Kaido is just a classical dick perhaps?</br></br></br>  <br>law disbands his crew cause don dicko is dead finally he is all happy then emo cause he is bored and lonely . luffy says join us law becomes a better medic than that shitty mutant freak</br>  <br> Law <br> leaving Bepo <br><br>m8. M8.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Sees that her situation was the same as Ace's, gets angry because of it, also reminds him of where he grew up in, a slum <br><br>Sourcing the manga where this wasn't even mentioned.

Considering that Kaidou needs 1000 animal zoans just to increase his power against Shanks a little bit, how fucking strong is he?  <br><br>When Roger got to Raftel, Buggy and Shanks had a fight. Buggy knocked Shanks onto the pedastal that the One Piece was situated on.<br><br>Touching it caused Shanks to obtain Yonko-level intimidation powers.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't think pirates are exactly against having a harem, though it's questionable if Luffy has any sex drive.</br>  Why didnt the marines search for viola and especially baby 5? When they found the executives they said something along the lines of "All eight exeutives found" which suggests that they knew the structures of the Donquixote family. So why didnt they include viola and baby 5 in their list of wanted executives? <br>It doesnt look like the executives werent mysterious unknown individuals with them being advertised in the colliseum matches and all, Viola left the family just earlier in the morning and baby 5 got engaged to Sai mere hours ago so information couldnt have spread that fast.</br>  <br>Didn't Luffy take out a few hundred in FI with CoC? Shanks can probably do more at higher strengths.</br>  <br>It could be a small one like on punk hazard</br>  <br>Riku would pardon Viola, Sai would be forced to run away with Baby 5 without saying his goodbyes. <br><br>No real point in Oda wasting panels on that.</br></br></br>  <br>There were probably a few marines nearby watching, and the allies would vouch for the ones they are unsure of. I think Fujitora was with Violet for a whole since she was basically calling or what was happening.</br>  Why is chapter 233 so good?  <br><br> sai trying to break through marine lines, defending baby 5 with his life <br> Chinjao and Boo helping out because shes now a part of the family <br> random marine asks why theyre defending a criminal <br> says they just need to detain all executives including baby 5 <br> "they need me" <br> baby 5 runs towards the marines and cuffs herself <br> everyones confused <br> marriage canceled <br> baby 5 rots in impel down <br> happy anyways since she was needed, by the entire marines/WG <br><br> not worth wasting panels on <br> countless other possibilities </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I get the feeling that that was supposed to sound depressing but it comes off as kind of dumb</br>  <br>Which one is that?</br>  <br> Buggy is searching for Cpt.

The outfit doesn't play to her strengths and goes for a different kind of appeal. But if I wanted that I could find someone else who scratches that itch much better.

Her face isn't distinct enough. Her personality isn't distinct enough either.<br><br>Also, Luffy hasn't referred to her as nakama or asked her to join and there hasn't been given any special emphasis towards her dream, which means he's not interested. Plus, she's too nice to be a pirate, even a "good" pirate. She's set to be queen of Dressrobe after Riku, too.</br></br></br>  <br>well good job not explaining how a barely there romance is well written and not just slapped on at the end</br>  <br> who will be the man behind the curtain? <br>Vegapunk<br><br> Toto? <br>Any zoan user on any of those crews with model: small dog...lol<br><br> what about all the witches? <br>No thoughts on this one</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>dont rile them up again<br><br>they only JUST settled down again</br></br></br>  <br> Any zoan user on any of those crews with model: small dog...lol <br><br>What if:<br><br> Dalmation goes after Bonney <br> Bonney turns him into a small child <br> carries him around like a pursedog </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you talking about SAO or FMA?</br>  <br>He saved a bunch of pirates. Also Doffy called him God so they may think he's actually the most dangerous of the crew</br>  <br><br>Daily reminder that Vegapunk will be a vegan.<br>He will be Luffy's opposite extreme. Meat-eating dumbass vs. vegan genius. Expect lots of bickering and mutual hate.</br></br></br>  <br>FMA<br><br>never did finish SAO</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think Rebecca will join but<br> Her face isn't distinct enough, her personality isn't distinct enough either <br>This is Oda we're talking about. The guy who thinks cloning Nami and giving her braids makes for a brand new character design.</br></br></br>  <br> Rebecca gets to lick the stamp </br>  <br>Waiting for it</br>  <br>No, Cesar Clown was fodder. Doffy is just a gradual stepping stone to Kaidou.</br>  So I think we can all agree that this guy has an ant zoan devil fruit. Ants are after all the strongest organism. Also it would make a lot of sense and tie into drake. When drake was a kid he followed a weakling captain. Dinosaurs are usually stronger than ants. This is probably a mental thing drake has and supports kaido being an ant zoan. Also In Hunter x Hunter the strongest character was an ant.  <br> implying the WG isn't going to twist the news and blame Dressrosa on God Usopp to save face </br>  <br>But not a crew member. Not someone who will be a consistent character and around all the way to the end of the manga</br>  <br>All the SH look distinct as fuck, even though Nami and Robin have the same bodytype their faces are blatantly different. Side characters get a lot of sameface but a main character is going to have to have her own look.</br>  <br>Thing is Fuji already admitted WG fucked up though</br>  <br>I have a feeling that Wano arc will be preceded by Zou micro arc, as well as maybe having Kaidou arc be concluded in another location as a small follow up arc (similar to Water 7 and Ennis Lobby). Or there's also a possibility that Small but considerable Big Mom arc will take place before Wano.</br>  How do you guys get the weely Viz translations?  <br>What Fujitora says now and what the WG will end up putting out may be completely different stories, though. Fuji is an honourable man, but the WG is not and would likely prefer to save face and their "official" report will likely implicate the SH pirates in the chaos.</br>  <br>Mature women don't dress like strippers, girls do. The only reason she's wearing that outffit in Z is because she's ten years younger and the skin of her belly doesn't sag.<br>The green sweater is the most mature outfit, by the common acceptation of the word.</br></br>  <br>But it's not ara~ ara~ enough</br>  <br>Hopefully you're right and I'm wrong. I'm pessimistic about Oda's willingness to work on his female designs though. These days it seems like hourglass Nami clone + new hairstyle are his only standards.</br>   movie Robin outfit discussion <br> no mention of gangster gunslinger Robin </br>  <br>Buggy is the fraud behind the curtain<br>Big Mom is the Wicked Witch<br>Good witch and Toto are more plot devices than characters</br></br></br>  <br>It's shonen. You've got to lower your standards.</br>  <br> hellsing <br> romance <br>Nigga wat. Everyone in that show was blueballed, nothing ever came of anything. It was an orgy of violence, written by a hentai artist with clothes/glasses/gloves fetishes. no actual sex/bodies are necessary for him to get off.</br></br></br>  My favourite Robin is Armani Robin.<br>I know I'm the only one though.</br>  <br>Too late, Fuji and Elizabello have already spread the news all over the world. WG won't be able to cover it up with lies even if they try.</br>  <br> tiger and bunny  <br>What romance was there beside Tiger and Bunny's</br></br>  <br> Hipster Zoro <br><br>Jesus</br></br></br>  <br>No, I was asking a question and the answer obviously is "there are basically none".</br>  <br>Glasses do suit him though.</br>  <br>I have this bad feeling he will be involved somehow</br>  <br>He's perfectly capable of drawing weird looking women, and women that are odd looking but still attractive.<br>For example, Perona is very visually distinctive, and still conforms to "hot".<br><br>Unfortunately my faith in him doesn't extend to a "non hot" female MC, despite how much I love characters like Miss Monday's design.</br></br></br></br>  <br>All their gang-star outfits in their movie were great. This is still my favourite luffy design.</br>  <br>Alucard/Integra is my only  het  ship<br><br>Celes and the dude with the hair was cute but  absorbing the fucker  isnt exactly a romance i'd consider to be written well</br></br></br>  <br> miss monday <br> not hot </br></br>  <br><br>This.<br><br>This is Fuji's entire motivation for hating the shichi system.<br><br>Doffy really is Croc 2.0</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Unfortunately my faith in him doesn't extend to a "non hot" female MC <br>Exactly. It's such a shame. I love Miss Monday's post timeskip's design too.</br></br>  <br>I meant "non hot" in the sense that Oda only likes to draw women he thinks are hot/are conventionally hot, hence the hourglass figures and pretty faces.<br>I would personally let Miss Monday crush my pelvis, but that's neither here nor there.</br></br>  <br>Blue Rose had that one sided crush on Kotetsu. Other than that I don't remember.</br>  <br> beside Tiger and Bunny' <br><br>uh.  Non- oh! Tiger and his dead wife? Keith and the robot girl he killed? <br/> <br>Bunny was thirsty enough to satisfy anyone's craving for romance</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, damn, I forgot about it, that was so annoying.</br>  <br>they're all so cute<br><br>Luffy's shorts are way too short there though.

Or do you not consider shonen to be a genre ?</br>  <br>valid points...</br>  <br>I remember reading years ago about how some people criticized Oda for not drawing "pretty enough" girls or some such.</br>  Do you guys think Bonney joining the crew would be good?  <br> thinking she wont become captain. of SH <br>kek, delusional faggots.<br>calling it now.</br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't that Kishimoto ? Oda's girls were always rather cute. Well they were a bit bony at first but now they're too curvy.</br>  <br>BASED DIOGENES</br>  <br>Why and how?</br>  <br>Yeah</br>  If Oda wasn't such a moneywhore, how many chapters do you think the Dressrosa arc would have been done by? I say 45 max.  <br>I'd prefer her to just be an ally like Law. I want to see more of her, and she'll probably want to help him take out BB.<br><br>Plus, I don't think the larder aboard the Sunny could handle her AND Luffy.</br></br></br>  <br>At the very least I would really like it if it happened. I like that she has no manners, it's refreshing, and "piratey".</br>  <br>no<br><br>how the fuck would Sanji keep both Luffy and Bonney fed?<br>None of Bonney's crew is likeable. We dont need them trailing along</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it finally over? Pretty sure i dropped it halfway through. Any changes made to the main crew?</br>  <br>I thought it was the readers who said it, but now that you mention it it could have been Kishimoto. Can't remember.</br>  <br>Another girl in the crew, and since her crew has been terminated she could ride with the strawhats. Also imagine all the shipping and fan fiction</br>  <br>None. Doflamingo was captured but it isn't clear if that was just a ruse or he'll somehow escape for more shenanigans. Luffy got a new powerup. We have yet to see what is happening with Big Mom and Sanji/Nami/etc.</br>  <br>Tg is seinen. Not only that op is a large adventure manga while tg is a small tragedy manga</br>  <br>Well, I think I can agree. I mean, the overall anime was pretty meh, and this romance wasn't with the main characters, but I guess it was good. Don't really find anything bad about it from my memory.</br>  <br>Shame. Yeah I saw the goofy new power up images. Welp, time to pick it back up again now that worst arc is over</br>  <br> None. Doflamingo was captured but it isn't clear if that was just a ruse <br>He's literally encased in Seastone</br></br>  <br>Cobras army defended against the civil war so that's not true.</br>  <br> being transported to Impel Down <br> *insert name here* intercepts to ship <br> kills all marines onboard <br> takes Doffy and crew with them <br><br>my vote is on Crocodile and Daz but any number of people could want Doffy for his connections/power</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> string clones <br> no view of his eyes yet </br></br>  <br><br> Jinbei <br>Jinbei is a member already, he's on his way to meet up with the crew right now<br><br> Kuzan <br>Not going to happen, he'll be leading the Marine/WG revolution faction with Smoker to reform the Marines away from Akainu<br><br> Viola <br>Unlikely. Interesting power, but not strictly necessary. Very little room for development of her character, no true dream in the same manner as the other Strawhats, more likely she'll be staying on Dressrosa now that she has her family back together.<br><br> Momo <br>Not happening. More likely that he has a role to play in the Wano plot; speculation has him as the kid emperor who had to flee when a coup happened, or else he left to try and get foreign aid from a famine? I forget exactly<br><br> Kinemon <br>Can't see it happening<br><br> Bellamy <br>Won't happen, though he may be an ally later on<br><br> Law <br>Unlikely, he has his own crew and doesn't even have a dream now that Doflamingo was taken down. He'll probably be the equivalent of a division leader for Luffy's growing alliance.<br><br> Kyros <br>Impossible<br><br> Rebecca <br>Incredibly unlikely<br><br> Barto <br>Not happening, he'll probably just be an allied group as part Luffy's fleet<br><br>NO ONE is joining from this arc, we won't be getting a new member until Wano. All of the characters introduced during Dressrosa either: (1) have obligations to stay on the island, (2) have strong reasons not to join a new crew, (3) have little to no room left for meaningful character development, or (4) have future importance to the plot. Or any mix of the above.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doffy also has whatever he's been using to blackmail the WG with to bargain his way to freedom with, and I doubt he doesn't have something in place in case the WG captured him. They may even do something insane like Buster Call Dressrosa and pardon Doofus to keep the secret.</br>  <br> drawing hancock <br> calling her robin <br>why</br></br></br>  <br>Why did she ask Law for harpy legs?</br>  <br> her sister Sugar <br>YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE!

Moreover the wings might have been so she could have dates in the sky with him.<br>Doffy probably had 3 fucks a day with random girls and boys in the pool but still.</br></br>  <br> acedies </br>  <br>Why not ?</br>  <br>The One Piece is a weapon created by the Ancient Kingdom to destroy the Red Line in order to create All Blue.</br>  <br>fuck</br>  <br>It's more likely to have been more of a familial relationship, considering he adopted her and Sugar as young kids almost right after he killed Rocinante. <br><br>Besides, the only  v  Doffy is after is  Crocodile's </br></br></br>  <br>Why is Snape kills Dumbledore the most famous spoiler ever ?

It's one of the more famous /b/ pranks.</br>  <br>Monet was 17 when Doffy took her in. It's not that farfetched that she'd have a crush on her savior. <br>Gladius is probably gay for him too.</br></br>  <br>Spike Dies and Ladies are pretty big spoilers, too.<br><br>Snape Kills Dumbledore however had near infinite lol value because it was leaked before the book came out officially and large amounts of people used to drive by the lines of nerds waiting outside book shops and shout the spoiler out.</br></br></br>  <br>because she had perfect legs</br>  <br>Still don't see why they choose that one in particular but okay.<br>Well, in retrospect, maybe that was the only noteworthy thing to happen in the 6th book.</br></br>  <br>I want to see Monet's sob story. Shame that Oda will probably never reveal it.</br>  <br> because it was leaked before the book came out officially and large amounts of people used to drive by the lines of nerds waiting outside book shops and shout the spoiler out <br>Seriously ? I had no idea. Thanks, I undersatnd better now.

But i guess that means that any pairing with alucard can be gay or straight, one of the many perks of cannon gender bending ayyylmao :^)  </br>  <br>It sounds better than Sancho whatshisface<br><br>Where the fuck did Homing come from?</br></br></br>  <br>And another just because.</br>  <br>it's always bugged me that artist dont draw Buffalo because he isnt as cute. He's still one of Doffy's kids</br>  <br>That picture is wrong, Adult Vergo and Law definitely fucks up the timeline.</br>  <br><br>He killed Monet. Fuck him.</br></br>  <br> I've made a terrible mistake </br>  <br>It was probably drawn back when people thought Doffy and Vergo rose Law together.<br>People still draw fanarts with that headcannon in mind though.<br><br><br>Yeah, it's kind of sad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>just another one with baby Delly. Say what you want about him now but he was the cutest little shit as a baby</br>  <br>only if she can do this</br>  <br> Doffy and Vergo rose Law together. <br><br>This sounds like a bad two and a half men episode.</br></br></br>  What retro anime have you watched lately?  <br>Almost finished Zeta. It's been really enjoyable but im not really looking forward to ZZ.<br><br>Also is Dirty Pair worth checking out?</br></br></br>  Literally that one. Finished the Nolandia one and the tv series. I thought episodes 25 and 26 were way better than the rest. Not sure if that had to do with the delayed release or what. I'm going to check out the movie by Mashimo and the rest of the franchise when I feel like it.  <br>Zeta was amazing, just as good as 0079 imo. But yeah ZZ is shit don't watch it.<br><br> Also is Dirty Pair worth checking out? <br>Dirty Pair is fucking awesome you should really check it out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tenchi Muyo Universe.<br>Ranma 1/2.<br>All subtitled.</br></br></br>  Devilman  Been going back through Lupin. Stuff is good, still stands up.  <br>Yo that 009 vs devilman hype right?</br>  Been waiting for this thread.<br><br>Watched the first half of Hakugei some time ago but dropped it. Gotta say i thought it to be pretty bad. I suppose I was expecting Treasure Island in space in it being more serious and not so much comedy. It is so far also the first Dezaki show I didn't like.<br><br>Are the Black Jack OVA's any good? <br><br><br> Dirty Pair is fucking awesome <br>Kinda want to watch it myself but I'm not the hugest fan of shows that are only just fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Never thought a dog could be this cool.  Excel Saga  <br>I just finished watching Gunbuster for the very first time, not but 5 minutes ago. <br><br>I'm still in tears. Why was this so good? How had I not watched it until now?<br><br>Where do I even go from here?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Where do I even go from here? <br><br>Diebuster, I guess.</br></br></br>  The premise is as unimaginably generic as it gets except for the MC being unable to deal with girls. A fun watch, the girls are cute, very classic style humor.<br><br><br>Diebuster, which is not as incredible but still a good watch. If you've somehow never heard Groovin' Magic before, you're in for a treat.</br></br></br>  Don't know if it's the same people in these threads, but I was that anon a few weeks ago watching Ashita no Joe and who didn't like Zeta.<br><br>Anyway, I finished all the Gundam in chronological order these last 3 weeks up to Mobile Fighter G Gundam which I'm watching now and really enjoying, even if it is a lot different than any previous Gundam. I'm also inclined to disagree with , Zeta wasn't anywhere near 0079, and ZZ isn't "shit" and it is very definitely worth a watch, it's just different than Zeta and 0079. I'd say 0079 &gt; 0080 &gt; (G Gundam so far) &gt; V Gundam &gt; CCA &gt; F91&gt; ZZ &gt; Z &gt; 0083<br><br>I'm also nearly done with Ashita no Joe 2, and while the first 12 episodes being a retelling of the last 25 or so episodes of the first series, I liked the retconning they did with Joe and Carlos' match (even though I was somewhat satisfied with the ending anyway) and removing the travelling boxing part. It's been a major improvement in a lot of ways over the first series - less kids and less filer - and the 1080p HorribleSubs rip looks really good.</br></br></br></br>  <br> in chronological order <br>Meant production order</br></br>    <br><br>Is Diebuster going to give me the same feels and make me seriously contemplate mortality, life and death, and human existence?</br></br>  <br>Not really, no.</br>  <br><br>No, probably not...Gunbuster is one of my favorite anime, and I didn't watch Diebuster for years after finishing Gunbuster because I wasn't interested. I finally did watch it, and while I did enjoy it, it didn't have the same magic of Gunbuster despite having groovin' magic of its own.</br></br>  Need help.<br><br>Are there any subs that I can use with the Kagura BD release of Rose of Versailles. Since apparently the guy that uploads the subbed episodes stopped doing so.<br>I think I remember some anon mentioning that there were some subs that I could download but I forgot.</br></br></br>  Finally got around to watching LOGH - 90 episodes in a week. It's meeting and exceeding pretty much all of my expectations, but I can't help but feel like some of the philosophies are the author projecting his own political and religious bias to the point of face-shoving.  Just rewatched this masterpiece, and props on Dirty Pair. I'm looking for another action-filled one with just the right tasteful degree of titillation, maybe I'll rewatch Bubblegum Crisis again. I wish there was more of this stuff out there.  Finally getting around to watching Gundam F91, the animation is disgustingly good so far but I can't say the characters are anything praiseworthy  <br>Watch Gunbuster II (Diebuster). Only the last two episodes are good though.</br>   that 80's fugitive story <br> that 80's hard science setting <br> that 80's 10/10 opening <br>I'm not too familiar with /m/ related material, but this series has been pretty impressive so far. The writing really had to carry these shows back then. Coupled with decent characters and an actually engaging plot I'm getting way into these classic style celluloid animations. Anime is a whole different beast when it actually has competent direction and writing behind it.</br></br></br>  Only 10 episodes into LoGH, but so far it's fantastic. I'm usually let down by series that are hyped to hell, but this is one series that deserves the praise. As a fan of sci fi, space politics, and war stories, it's perfect for me.<br><br>Dougram is slow paced and can be boring as shit, but it's to be expected from a Takahashi show, and it's good when I'm in the mood for it.<br><br>I've been watching Sailor Moon for the past 5 months because I've put the show on hold so many times because the episodic nature gets boring real fast, but I still like it.   Rei is best sailor.  </br></br></br></br>  Was watching Mobile Suit Gundam 0079, but stopped for a bit to watch some newer stuff and play games. I've also been rewatching YYH and am right before Toguro's team vs. Yusuke's team. I've been really tempted to give Urusei Yatsura another try since I got about 50 episodes in last time, but I think I burnt myself out trying to marathon it.  About 30 or so episodes into G Gundam  I'm enjoying the tournament arc a lot . <br><br>Watched Jin-Roh last week and that was extraordinary.<br><br>Saw Memories as well. Magnetic Rose is the only one really worthwhile. Stink Bomb and Cannon Fodder were dogshit compared to the masterpiece that was Magnetic Rose.<br><br>Finally, I watched the first Patlabor OVA. Why is Noa so perfect.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kinnikuman.</br>  <br>I will agree, LoGH is definitely worth all the praise it gets. The only parts I didn't like were near the end, but damn was the series much better than I expected it to be.</br>  <br>watching Kochikame right this very second</br>  <br>F91 was meant to be a larger project, like Early UC was, and I don't know the specifics as to why, but it didn't get a full series and was made into a movie. That's why it's incredibly rushed and has no real on-screen conclusion. The animation quality and MS designs are pretty much it's only redeeming qualities.<br><br>Also,<br> watching <br> so far <br>I hope to fuck you're pausing and not just split-screen watching it/on another monitor while shitposting on 4chan. If you are, then I hope you realise you have no right to complain about characters or story since you're not paying full attention to it. Part of me thinks that 95% of most criticism on /a/ is a result of not actually watching it and just putting it on the side and pretending to, just so that they can shitpost about it on 4chan. Not really related to your post, but it really grinds my gears when people do that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> split-screen watching it/on another monitor while shitposting on 4chan <br><br>Is that a thing that people do? I can't really multitask like that because I always miss something and end up having to rewind it.</br></br></br>  <br>Just watched both of the Daicon shorts, such a pleasant little experience. Just simple fun. <br><br>On that note I've watched a few really short things recently and I'm loving how quick and digestible this stuff is, just a neat little story wrapped up into just a few minutes.<br><br>Going to dl Gunbuster next, I'm just in love with gainax right now.</br></br></br></br></br>   Pre 2000's <br> Retro  <br><br>kill yourself</br></br></br>  <br>I think 0080 is by far the best Gundam. Marathoning it was an experience.</br>  Currently working through pic related.<br><br>The plot's all over the place, but the visuals and direction are really neat. <br>A lot of cool stuff with scene framing and cutting between one event and another.</br></br></br>  <br>This was good and gives me nostalgic feels just because it was really popular on forums when I first really got on the internet, but there were definitely some excessively slow scenes.</br>  I just started watching Initial D 1st Stage  Nearing the halfway point in Maison Ikkoku, good shit, the cast is great fun to watch.  I rewatched Lain a little while ago.  <br>I never watched the last two episodes. <br><br>I have to say I went in with higher expectations but it was still good.</br></br></br>  I've been watching Dragon Ball a lot lately. I'm really digging it. It's a hell of a lot more fun than Z, and kid Goku is adorable.  I rewatched the first 4 Dominion Tank Police OVAs, watched the Riding Bean OVA, and I'm halfway through Macross 7. Does 7 get any better?  Watched Turn A Gundam like a week ago. I thought it was great.<br><br>Probably starting After War Gundam X today.<br><br>After finishing the UC timeline I watched Gundam SEED which immedeatly made me stop watching any Gundam believing that if it wasnt UC it wasn't worth watching. After watching Turn A I believe in Gundam again.</br></br></br></br>  This thread reminds me that fanservice in anime used to be about more than just giant, gigantic, ridiculous and boring big tits everywhere.<br>Really, 3D is more appealing than 2D as of late.</br>  <br> But yeah ZZ is shit don't watch it. <br><br>Where do these people come from? Only the first few episodes of ZZ are shit and then it goes straight back to Zeta lvls of good.</br></br></br>  Project A-ko<br> B-ko  a best.</br>  <br>I watched Venus Wars</br>  Watched Legend of Lemnear move the other day, it was pretty good. Retro anime has the sexiest girls and art style holy shit, it is so much better than today it's not even close.<br><br>I usually try and break it up though, since most older stuff is usually way way longer I will watch a long retro show, then a few cours of new shows, the retro and so on. I'll probably watch pic related next since I like ranma so much.</br></br>  <br>Good man. Now watch Giant Gorg.</br>  <br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=AuT<wbr>R2OaeidU</wbr>  [ ] </br>  <br>what</br>  <br>when I saw that someone answered, I was afraid for a second I'd be told that it's post-2000.<br><br>will watch GG</br></br></br>  <br>You will know soon enough.</br>  <br>Na, Venus Wars is 1989.</br>  I haven't watched any old anime recently, but I recently read Ode to Kirihito and I thought it was fantastic. One of the most fascinating portrayals of mental illness I have ever seen and I loved the poignant religous imagery as well. Anybody know any Tezuka anime worth seeing?<br><br>Also, it doesn't really count but I'm watching HxH 2011 right now and I don't like it that much. Any fans up to explaining the appeal?</br></br>  I have been watching gundam X off and on for the last half a year and I have to say this should have been imported and broadcast sooner. It lends itself real well to people well versed in gundam and its a pretty fun what if story/alternate future if the federation utterly failed in protecting earth. Although I don't think there has been any mention of Zeon or any other link to the original series other then the whole gundam/federation affiliation. I feel like they wanted it to have stronger ties but didn't so they could have their own story and what not.<br><br>If you want my opinion on the series, its good. Very good action mecha. Likable developing characters. Brutal violence. I especially liked the episode dealing with the two side character gundam pilot's back stories pretty great for just a one off episode.</br></br>  <br> Also, it doesn't really count but I'm watching HxH 2011 right now and I don't like it that much. Any fans up to explaining the appeal? <br>I dropped it around episode 38. I actually enjoyed it until they started getting into the nen stuff.</br></br>  I've been thinking of starting Akage no Ann recently. Maybe Gunbuster too, after seejng this thread.<br><br>What's the best site for older abime/best subs/dubs?</br></br>  <br>I could give it a shot at HxH since I'm about a third of the way done. You have to love shounen. No question. After what I've watched it get the same feeling of when I watched dragonball z back when I was in high school. I love the simple characters. I love the simple motivations. I love the concepts of friendship. The little bits here and there about the different powers and martial arts stuff that comes at about 20 or 30 episodes in. The rivalries. I mean everything its a fun series and if you don't watch anime that deals with lighter topics or can't deal with shounen tropes I can see why HxH isn't up your alley.</br>  <br>Bakabt usually has the best releases. Just be sre to read comments.</br>  The only time an anime hand clench made me moist.  <br>Slightly better, but not a lot. Dynamite 7 isn't all that bad though, so just stick with it.<br><br><br>You can find Gunbuster on freeleech on bakabt, and the Akage no Anne blurays are on nyaa. They're unsubbed, but check the archive for subs that some anon timed to the blurays. The release for Akage no Anne on bakabt is absolute garbage, so avoid that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anyone?</br>  <br>It might be too late, but don't go into HxH expecting the best anime ever. I went in expecting crap like Naruto and was very pleasantly surprised. It's definitely a battle shounen manga like this anon says  but it's very well done for what it sets out to be. I guess the main appeal personally are the varied character designs, different powers that aren't just shoot laser beams, and how the world has so many mysteries and the story has so many potential branching points that the author could elaborate on but doesn't. I like my stories like I like my women dressed: just enough shown to tantalize the imagination. Also, how far are you into it? Still during the Hunter Exam?</br>  <br>One of the things I actually like about the show is the dark humor, the whole lighthearted journey in a fucked-up world kinda vibe it has going on. The artwork and animation is solid too. I'm just not really sure where it's going right now, and if it's building towards something meaningful yet. That whole Zoldyck mini arc felt pretty pointless honestly. All I got from that is Killua's family does love him in their own way, but I'm not sure how relevant they're going to be down the line.</br>  <br>This is amazing.<br><br>Google tells me it's from Patlabor, right? Where should I start if I wanted to start watching this?</br></br></br>  <br><br>It was paused faggot<br><br>Also I finished it and it was decent though felt really unfocused and I can see how it was originally going to be a series. Big points for animation, it looked pretty slick<br><br><br><br>Fine faggot heres your food choo choo here comes the spoonfeed<br><br>webm is from the first Patlabor movie, the first two movies in the franchise are fantastic, everything else including the TV series is okay but nothing amazing.<br><br>You can start with the movies shit don't matter</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just got into the Heavens Arena arc, I'll probably keep watching for a bit. It's certainly not bad, but I don't know whether or not it's just a matter of not being my cup of tea yet.</br>  <br>Yeah, I'd say keep watching until at least after York Shin City since that's a lot of fans' favorite part and it sort of goes downhill after that.</br>  <br> read in an interview that one of Hiromu Arakawa's facourite series was Kinnikuman <br> now I'm not surprised at all <br><br>Also I didn't know Kinnikuman was this old</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> You can start with the movies shit don't matter <br>This is fucking stupid advice and should ignore this cancerous faggot.<br><br>Watch the Early Days OVA, then the Patlabor movies in release order.<br> <br>The Patlabor TV series and other OVA, New Files, are in a completely separate continuity from the Early Days/Movie timeline, so you can watch either timeline before the other.<br><br>Or, you know, you could have just googled Patlabor and found your answer on wikipedia.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You haven't finished S yet, have you? </br>  <br>Well I did look that up on wikipedia, but I was just wondering if one was easier to get into or more highly recommended than another. Thanks for spoonfeeding me anyway, I'll shut my trap now.</br>  <br>I've only seen the movie timeline, but I plan to watch the tv series and other ova towards the end of the month, so I can't say which is better.</br>  Best pre 2000 coming through  <br>Best anime.</br>  <br>One of my favorites. Didn't like the way she died though. <br><br>Also might you know where to get subs for the BDrips?</br></br></br>  I have city hunter on my hdd gonna watch it this weekend. Maybe.  <br>Probably the best Shoujo animu and manga ever conceived together with Utena.<br>Thank you Dezaki.</br></br>  <br>Nah brah the new hip thing to do is shit on Zeta and claim ZZ is a masterpiece.</br>  I recently discovered and started to watch this forgotten gem, an archaic remnant of a bygone era. <br><br>The plot progression and characters seem like tired cliches from a modern viewpoint, plus the animation and the visuals also look awfully dated. But it still has that oldschool charm! It's worth a look, I say.</br></br>  Watching Legend of the Galactic Heroes right now. It's a bit visually stale for my taste, the direction is rather mediocre and the exposition can be rather unsubtle at times. The story is ok and some of the characters are great though, especially Yang.  <br>Finally someone else on /a/ who knows of this underrated masterpiece!</br>  <br>Never noticed before, but it kinda looks like Unit 01 has a dick hanging there.</br>  <br>Go be retarded somewhere else</br>   all these old shows <br> usually like 50 episode minimum <br><br>It's cool because you get so much more of a god show but goddam, the time commitment is huge</br></br></br>  <br><br>Urusei Yatsura is so good.

Does it get better?  I finished Neo-Tokyo. I didn't enjoy running man at all, but that last one about the out of control robot city was fantastic and something like you'd find in the Illustrated Man.  donwloaded EXDriver but I still have to watch it, I need to finish Bodacious Space Pirates first. I've been told it's boring though.  <br>Since I've never had to do that mind explain how to, with mpc hc that is?</br>  <br>better than the JP version imo</br>  <br> Does 7 get any better? <br><br>7 is great, it gets better and coasts then just shoots up with an 11/10 ending.<br><br>He's the best idol of all time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Does 7 get any better? <br><br>LISTEN TO HIS SONG</br></br></br>  <br>Gundam Wing<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ljX<wbr>FL4dyDIk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br><br>B-ko is great but A-ko has lovely hair</br></br>  <br> Retro anime has the sexiest girls and art style holy shit <br><br>Look up the character designer for Lemnear.

Sasuga Gundam, always top notch OPs.</br>  <br>It may be gross rape porn but it's still more interesting than Demon city shinjuku. Seriously, the reason Ninja scroll is so tops is because Kawajiri ironed out all the wrinkles by making the movie twice before he even starting working on it.</br>  Dragonball Kai BDs put the video back to the original 4:3 that DBZ was in, it would be a redo of DBZ if only they didn't butcher some scenes with those horrible "redraws" (they trace over the original art in crayons, see: 0:46 of this next webm)<br><br>http://a.uguu.se/imstvy.webm<br><br>http://a.uguu.se/ewirvc.webm<br><br>The guy currently doing the BDs seems to also be throwing on the Kikuchi ost which is nice, more like the classic series.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the exposition can be rather unsubtle at times. <br><br>Keep in mind that it was adapted for fans of the books, and takes a 'documentary' like perspective at times.<br><br>SKIP THE NEXT EPISODE PREVIEWS</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the time commitment is huge <br><br>50 episodes is only like 16 hours or so.</br></br></br>  <br>You can watch 4 great 12 episode shows in the time of one 50 episode show.</br>  <br><br>I really liked flower girl<br><br>It's completely false but I love the rumour that she's actually Sheryl.

I've rewatched it alone countless times.</br>  Now and then, and and there.<br> I'm not sure why Lala Ru decided to drop the water ON the flying fortress. She killed hundreds of innocent peoples, if she wanted to help humanity by giving them water she could at least try not to kill half of the remaining human on earth in the process.  Except the weird ending it was really worth watching, I recommend it.<br>I'm a sucker for dystopia, are there any good anime with distopia setting worth watching ?</br></br>  I'm almost done with Gundam 0083, and goddamn it's animation is absolutely amazing. I thought 08th MS Team and F91 had superb animation already, but this was some next-level shit.<br><br>However, everything else about it is shit.</br></br>  <br> I'm a sucker for dystopia, are there any good anime with distopia setting worth watching ? <br><br>Texhnolyze</br></br></br>  Finished Creamy Mami and started watching Pastel Yumi. There's a piece of background music that heavily rips off Harpo's Moviestar, but I guess it's just different enough that they got away with it.  <br>It's been on my backlog for years, time to watch it I guess.</br>  <br>Getting into LOGH. Only got into the first 2 episodes, but I'm loving it so far. <br><br>That and Ranma Manga. But I re-read that alot, so.</br></br></br>  Right now, 39th episode of LOGH. It's boring sometimes, but totally worth watching.<br><br><br>Watching Yang Wenli is like watching myself in 2D, except he's a top tier tactician and I'm a lazy medical student.</br></br></br>    Finished Key the Metal Idol, watching Nightwalker now, it's alright.  <br> Yang is like me XD <br>Really anon</br></br>  <br><br>Have this on my HD, I hear it drops the ball near the end.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9y7<wbr>KrcfuxAw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>The end gets fucking wild, but I really liked it. The extended opening on the last episode was so good, the English opening is also superior.</br>  <br>When I finish this show I'll probably pick up Key.</br>  Haven't watched it since I was a kid. I never realized that  its one of the worst animes of its time   <br>im watching that right now. Dont really like episodic anime though. So ill just finish it and move on</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=d9e<wbr>qVWn59SQ</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>So, what was the episode were the seiyuu broke the mic screaming "Voltekker?"</br></br>  <br>I watched the english dub of this when I was 8 on early saturday morning around 6 AM.</br>  <br><br>39 and 49 I do believe.</br></br>  <br><br>ZZ is very hit or miss but the first half is a chore to get through but the second and third parts have some pretty damn good episodes. <br><br>Lately I've watched Be Invoked, Queen Emeraldas OVAs since I've wanted to get more into the Leijiverse since watching Arcadia of My Youth a while back,planning on downloading the first season of Lupin soon.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Finished Escaflowne lately too, fantastic detailing and OST, really lovely show. However Merle really made things annoying and had some cringe inducing comedic scenes.</br></br>  <br> that ending </br>  <br>I found her rather useless and forced to create some love triangle that doesnt get used in the rest of the story at all. Its like they drew her in scenes and then were like "alright just keep her in because killing her off would be too much of a hassle". That said the MC was a fucking pussy that constantly wondered which dick she should ride rather than being useful.</br>  <br><br>Why couldn't Merle be as useful or as badass as Folken's catgirls? A shame she never really developed a change to shine.<br><br>I think the only scene she was useful in was when Hitomi got kidnapped by the frog people but they would've worked out something wasn't right at a later moment but that's the only useful thing I recall her doing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>because the good guys already had enough characters to fill the required hole. Merle had no job to fullfill. She couldnt fight and wasnt smart.</br>  <br>I think I enjoy Urusei Yatsura more because it feels a little less restrained in terms of how silly it can get.<br><br>And I must admit, I love these stupid anime in-jokes.</br></br></br>  how's crunch joe?  <br><br>Gasaraki.</br></br>    <br>Same. 7's great so far. Though pales in comparison to SDF and Frontier. I like Plus the least. Wish to finish 7 soon so I can move to Zero  Home, sweet, home </br>  <br><br> I like Plus the least. <br><br>How? It's one of the best pieces of Macross. I hope you watched the movie version.<br><br>Sorry to spoil your fun but Zero is one of the worst Macross entries along with Frontier.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Once you start reading and watching it, you become very aware of just how old the series is. The anime especially.<br><br>I'm not just talking about the fact that it was animated by 80s Toei. The anime is really steeped in references to Japanese sports, celebrities, snacks, and most notably country relations at the time.<br><br><br>Hey, at least I've never had to Google anything for Urusei Yatsura.<br><br>Also, shouldn't you be watching some little girl shows?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Watched the OVA series. It was great, actually. But I enjoyed SDF and Frontier (I think) more. Can't speak for 7 yet.</br>  <br> Watched the OVA series. It was great, actually. <br><br>Damn, I've been trying to steer people away from the OVA's because the movie has one scene which MUST be added in. People should actually watch the movie for Plus first and then the OVA's if they want more</br></br></br>  <br>I should?</br>  Watching legend of the galactic heroes and revolutionary girl Utena rn and they're both amazing<br>Will probably pick up Gunbuster and Turn A Gundam p soon</br>  watched those who hunt elves season 1 and 2. <br>about to rewatch ghostsweeper mikami and maybe key the metal idol after that.</br>   Macross <br> LoGH <br> Weird OVAs from god knows when  <br> Kinikuman <br> Zenki <br> Orphen was pre 2000? <br> Mikami <br> Los Justicieros (no idea how you say this on english?) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> google los justiceros <br>nice one spic dubbers</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GOL<wbr>7MXqdEMM</wbr>  [ ]<br>Much better than the raw OP</br></br>  Is Rider Bean any good?  <br>I regret picking it up.</br>  <br>Yeah, Riding Bean is great.</br>  <br> pablo saying los justicieros <br>stopped<br><br><br>Yeah it's cool.

I'm in the middle of Motto and while she's really cute, Onpu is probably my favorite of the girls. She's not as outwardly super nice as the rest of them, but she does the same acts of kindness to help others without being as overt as her friends. Also her character development to stop being so selfish and uncaring about others is really natural. The most evident change is that she is prone to making the same dumb reaction faces as the rest of them as time goes on instead of being too cool like she was in her first appearance, it's like poetry, every stanza rhymes with the last<br><br>Momoko coming in so late also doesn't ruin her character or whatever, the first half of Motto is super Momoko focused</br></br></br>  <br><br>Its alright. Nothing special. Watch the older series for the superior animation.</br></br>  <br>I don't like Onpu at all. I'm halfway through Sharp and I still do not like her.</br>  <br><br>From what I've seen so far:<br><br>Zeta&gt;0079&gt;ZZ&gt;08th Team&gt;0083&gt;0080&gt;CCA<br><br>Zeta being best of course and CCA being the worst.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actual best girl coming through.</br>    <br>She's next to Onpu in girls at the bottom.<br><br><br>There's just nothing I like about her. She's cute but that's about it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Escaflowne would have been even better if there had never been your pic related. She was annoying and a whore.</br>  <br>This blasphemy, finish the entirety of doremi and you will see the truth.</br>  <br>I don't actually mean that we can't be tomodachi but she's super good so please let her into your heart onegai. She's at her best when she's taking care of Hana or Momoko. I also didn't like her for the longest time but I think that was the point and it was the episode where she took care of Hana by herself that got me to turn around<br><br>I think when I finish Motto or Glass Mask 2005 or Gallery Fake or something I'm watching that's really long but not Dragon Ball, it'll be a good idea to watch Hana Yori Dango. I've looked extensively at the credits and it's literally 90 percent of the Ojamajo Doremi production staff. On Hana fucking Yori Dango</br></br></br>  <br>Why do you want to experience rage again?</br>  <br>Her naisho episode was spectacular.</br>  <br>I've looked through the archives in little girl threads and heard it compared to a horror anime so I'm looking how that goes.</br>  <br>Actually watched the first two episodes of this last night.

That is, until next week when Sebas explains what the hell's going on.  <br>it's morely a Cross between Log Horizon and RE:monster than being like SAO</br>  <br>Who cares about that when NNB is boring as fuck?<br>CD is at least fun and entertaining, unlinke NNB, and CGI dragons don't bother me in the least, so try again, moeshitter</br></br>  <br>Well technically it could still be trapped in a game world, but unlike SAO it would mean Ainz is also just a copy of his real mind and programmed to believe he has senses and shit when it's all just data.</br>  <br>Outside of being a monster it's nothing like Re:Monster. Ainz starts with everything, Rou starts with barely anything. Rou however has the ability to gain everything, while Ainz can't even learn martial arts.</br>  Waiting for HS to rip it.  <br>For them first letter is never the same</br>  <br>apart from the first battle scene, I think it was great. Cant wait for more. Faithful to the ln and didnt feel as rushed as the manga.</br>  <br> death nOte <br> Okaiji <br><br>i think you are onto something anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>translation: battle scene was horrible, talking heads was more tolerable as long no one moved, pacing is shit - stretched the intro worse than manga and most episode being exposition.</br>  <br>not posting superior version</br>  <br>powerful ex-human monster leads others against all challenges in an RPG-like world.<br>sure Ainz isn't starting at lvl 1 and is a mage rather than a Fighter, but the the parallels are there.</br></br>  <br>cant deny that. I hated that fucking battle scene. It would have been better if there wasnt one. If they wanted to start with a battle scene, it had to be glorious.</br>  <br>that right there would be a hilarious outcome for Ainz</br>  Can't find the subs on Nyaa, are they only on Funimation/another streaming site for now?  <br>So, how many eps are we getting?<br>also does anyone have the full op?</br></br>  Is the light novel good?  <br>6 BD's so 12-13 eps usual disc jewing practice. It would be a miracle against nip jewing senses to do 2 cour season as 6x 4ep discs. Usually 2 cour seasons are 8 discs on average. 10-12 when they think they can easily jew it.</br>  <br>Konno Light novel is Sugoi!</br>  <br>Yeah, HS said it will be delayed for a few hours.</br>  <br>What do you think? Better than both anime and manga.</br>  <br>Yes although the translation is funny sometimes. But better than nothing.</br>  <br> 60 bucks for 2 eps <br>I will never understand.</br></br>  <br> light novel <br> good <br>If you consider the fact that most light novels are garbage, then this is slightly less garbage than a lot. Still bad by normal standards, but not bottom of the barrel.</br></br></br>  <br><br>To actually explain what this guy said, a part of YGGDRASIL was brought with him when he was transported to a different fantasy world. The game mechanics still work for him and his guild (like having an inventory), although I doubt that, that's a part of the natural order of the world he's been transported to.<br><br>As for there being other players,  others have appeared before him and made big waves which have shaped the world's history. Who knows if there are any other players currently living in the same time period as Ainz, though. </br></br></br></br>  Chances of this being more than 1 cour?  <br>Zero.</br>  <br> most light novels are garbage <br>Well, there are some good light novels like ___________ and _______________. Of course you can't forget ______________.</br></br>  <br>That wasn't what I meant, but I see your point. However the parallels you pointed out are all kind of skewed and not too similar.<br><br>Rou is climbing his way up the ladder of the world. Ainz is basically just trying to keep his place on the top of that ladder. <br><br>If you can make parallels to Re:Monster then it's no different with The New Gate where Shin is the strongest and leads his npc supporters who are also the strongest among the world to do silly shit.<br><br>The only strong similarity between Ainz and Rou is both are aiming for World Domination, and the former isn't whole hearted nor planned for it while the other is taking it as natural almost.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> _______________ <br>Oh, man. I love _______________</br></br>  <br>all you need is kill</br>  <br>Most likely, the 8 kings are said to have reincarnated so they are most likely grinding levels and shit secretly since they are disbanded.<br><br>Fluder's lifespan alone pretty much proves you don't need to give a shit about dying of old age so long as your level is high, and the 8 kings are hinted at being former max levels as well.</br></br></br>  <br>Fate/Zero and Kara no Kyoukai.</br>  <br><br><br>Whom to believe?</br></br></br>  Other players probably used world items and that is reason MC guild cant learn martial arts.  <br> Overlord  <br>Never heard of this before, but it looks promising. I trust the manga is good as well?</br></br>  <br>That's Narbel you retard</br>  <br>Manga skips alot of stuff so while it seems to look great to anyone that reads it they're really missing out on the LN which is even better by far.</br>  <br>Glorious.

Otherwise it's passable.</br>  <br>That sucks since I probably won't see the VN unless its on steam or something.</br>  <br>it's a ln, anon misspelled</br>  <br> steam <br>kek</br></br>  <br> Baccano<br>Durarara</br></br>  <br>LN*, some anon keeps typoing it.</br>  <br>which is why its the superior version retard</br>  We should keep a list of all the sins these episodes commit.  <br>Like higurashi? it recently got a steam release.</br>  <br>subs when?</br>  <br> LN's on Steam <br><br>This will be a new breakthrough.</br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't paying attention.</br>  WHERE ARE THE FUCKING SUBS  <br>It's out. HS  480p </br>  <br>...its not a VN...</br>  <br><br><br><br>http://www.gogoanime.com/overlord-e<wbr>pisode-1</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>720p out too.</br>  <br>I have realized that.</br>  <br>if they put some buttons and bg music I think they might make it lol</br>   That shitty fight at the beginning <br> Spending too much time on Albedo's Albedos <br> No golem summoning <br> No Key of Solomon <br> No dialogue between guardians <br><br>God dammit Madhouse.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So it is. 1080 now too. GO GO GO</br>  <br> gogo </br>  <br> Spending too much time on Albedo's Albedos <br>10/10 episode.</br></br>  It makes me sad knowing that the anime will ultimately kill the LN translations like it always happens.  is hs release censored?  <br>There isn't any fanservice except skeleton groping tits and that is done below the edge of the screen. She is bouncy as fuck though.</br>  <br>The anime will end before it catches up with the translation.</br>  Maruyama and so-bin did have a hand in the production right?<br><br>RIGHT?</br></br>  <br>does the hs release show it fully?</br>  So, is it good or just another Sword Art Online clone?  <br>No, its good LN ruined by Badhouse.</br>  <br> it's morely a Cross between Log Horizon and RE:monster than being like SAO <br><br>Except that in Overlord, the MC actually owns all that gold in Log Horizon's game treasury and the MC owns a nearly uncountable number of great magic items and has incomparable skills just as his minions also have more powers than anyone else in the world.<br><br>This is the first anime in decades to start out the MC so overpowered and wealthy and with so many followers and advantages. It's a real self-insert gary stu fantasy particularly since the MC is allowed to and does behave in evil fashion. Ethics and the sense of "good" behaviour are not part of his vocabulary. If he does "good" things it is out of convenience for future plans.</br></br></br></br></br>   Madhouse <br>There goes any hope of ever having a second season.<br>Prepare for shitty anime original ending.</br></br>  <br> good LN <br>So nothing of value then?</br></br>  <br>that's not for sure. From the OP it seems it at least reaches vol 4.</br>  <br>Yes, but the translations always stop after a short boost when the anime is over.</br>  Ehh, just noticed that the Opening also shows scenes from 5th and 6th volumes. Sebas in capital and Demiurge (without Black Knight next to him). + Lizardbros and Cocytus fighting with multiple weapons.<br><br>All the wrong gear too, so I damn hope those are teasers for OP only.</br></br>  autotune aside I kinda liked the OP.   download TerribleSubs <br> first 40 seconds of Company logos <br> first second after shows the text "massive online multiplayer blablabla" <br> hardsubs <br>I stopped the download.</br></br></br></br>   Yes.<br> No.<br> Maybe. <br> I don't know.<br> Can you repeat the question?<br><br> Sasuga /a/. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably, since they don't do shit in the first three volumes.<br><br>I think it'll end with Shalltear fight.</br></br></br>  The camera panning is hurting my eyes its so fucking choppy.  <br>another SAO crap.<br> DROPPED </br></br>  <br>Vampire Hunter D, I suppose...<br>Though that's probably considered low tier around here.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, we'll see how the first volume pans out, if it takes 3 or even 4 eps, they wouldn't have enough room to do 4+ volumes. Unless they want to totally butcher the pacing.</br>  <br> It makes me sad knowing that the anime will ultimately kill the LN translations like it always happens. <br><br>First of all, the light novel is very far ahead. There is enough LN material for many cours already.<br><br>Second, this anime is by MadHouse so it will only get one season. Since OverLord is announced for only one cours for its first season, that means the anime is done at 13 episodes. Therefore, it will never catch up to the LN.<br><br><br> &gt;Spending too much time on Albedo's Albedos <br>Albedo and Narberal have character goods sales potential, so of course the anime will show them off. The merchandisers are bound to be on the production committee for this type of LN conversion to anime. Thus, the anime plot will be influenced by what the merchandisers need in order to promote and sell products.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  did anyone who watched the at-x raw notice anything different in the horriblesubs release? any scene missing or blackened/blurred?  <br>You don't understand, anon. After the anime is over, the translations will surely slow down a lot. It always happens, it's inevitable.</br>  <br>Yeah that's what you get for watching FuniShit.</br>  Poor One Punch Man fans. This is demonstration of what awaits you.  <br> The camera panning is hurting my eyes its so fucking choppy. <br><br>In other words, you'd like to have 100% CGI which reduces the chop from panning fast. Of course, that means you have the small subtle chop all the time of certain types of movements (and essentially no chop from some types of movements).</br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of merchandise<br><br>Lizardbros with real kung fu grip when</br></br></br>  <br>Why would it be?</br>  <br><br><br>Kino's Journey, Boogiepop Phantom, Spice and Wolf, and bam, all the decent ones named, at least out of the ones people here generally know about.</br></br></br>  Wait what ? How can they anime it when there are so few chapters ?  <br>Nah, there's no motion/panning judder in at-x raw, it's funishit fucking their shit up again. And that's what we get from Horrible rips.</br>  <br> Reading butchered manga from a longer source and even prior start test on web. <br> Believing that the manga is the original. <br><br>You don't visit Papa Bones threads often do you?</br></br></br></br>  <br> You don't understand, anon. After the anime is over, the translations will surely slow down a lot. It always happens, it's inevitable. <br><br>Even without an anime, translations slow down over time as the TL or staff get tired or older or graduate from school and move on with their lives. You have been spoiled in the cases where the translation was started by graduates who were blessed by good financial position and friends to help them or they already had level 2 skills. You should also exclude those fast and long translations done for profit. One fan site has over 10 million views per month and a slew of donations, so of course it keeps churning out the material so as long as the donation money keeps coming in.</br></br></br>  <br> liking Badhouse <br>Bet you liked Parasyte too</br></br>  SEMEN DEMON  <br>Fuck off back to &gt;&gt;&gt;/ln/<br><br>Oh wait... you dont even have own board HAHAHAHA. /a/ is anime and MANGO</br></br></br>  <br>I bet you didn't like it.</br>  <br> Wait what ? How can they anime it when there are so few chapters ? <br><br>There are very many chapters published in the original language. Do not assume the number of english translated chapters is anywhere close to the number of original language chapters already published. Translation is far behind....</br></br></br>  <br>So, what is your point?<br>I just stated the fact that LN translations always stall after the anime is over, even when they started before the anime, e.g. Maoyuu or Sakurasou.</br></br>  <br>No need to be so hurt, just report the evil trespassers for violating you and it'll all be well.</br>  <br>dat ed, my penis.<br>http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>x299p_overlord-ed_music</wbr></br></br>  <br>You're retarded, the manga is already caught up.<br><br>Also, lurk the fuck more.</br></br></br>  <br> Mahou Sensou <br>Thanks for letting me know to avoid this shit</br></br>  <br> ... </br>     another "MC is sent into a video game world" <br>Dear god, how many more of this shit can they produce before people are bored of it ?</br>  <br>They won't stop until  you stop being a faggot. </br>  That Mare landing and skirt tug with his running animation. Oh dear japan, why, I will resist to the bitter end.  <br>I don't know, how many of "4 cute girls in a club doing cute shit" can they produce?</br>  Are we really stuck with Funishit?  <br>Anon pls.  we're still not done with magic sword highschool harem ln adaptions  :^)</br>  <br>And all of those read even more like a pilots's pre-flight checklist for a cessna.</br>  <br>Its new Sword and Sorcerry. The normal litterature is now infested by it as well.</br>    <br> data "animation" <br>They even managed the static Papa Bones to look cropped and out of place</br></br>  <br>boku no pico</br>  <br>France have no simulcast for it and if nobody OCR FUNi subs, we won't have the show translated.</br>  If it really is 13 eps im really worried.<br>Op had not only Shalltear in her armor but Cocytus agaisnt the lizards, that would make it volumes 1-4 in one cour.</br>  <br>this looks like shit</br>  wasn't this shorter than the first chapter of the manga?  The ED vocalist's voice sounds like LiSA's.  <br>This is not Charlotte</br>  <br>she's pretty cute, is she apart of the harem?</br>  Is it only me or is the HS episode have fucking terrible panning?  <br>Reminder that it's okay in raws.</br>  <br>Face needs a little work, but man. Mare's looking pretty hot.</br>  <br> she </br>  <br> she </br>  <br>They gave us that fight in the beginning in exchange for dialogue at the end.<br><br>Bad trade if you ask me.</br></br></br>  <br>God, this sucks. It's in times like this that I regret not knowing moon.</br>  <br>Both twins are females.</br>  I wish Hakomari got an adaptation instead of this.  <br>but Hakomari is garbage</br>  <br>now you're just being deluded anon.</br>  <br>Why do you lie on the internet, anon?</br>  So this is pretty much Log Horizon with spooky skelly Shiroe.  <br>I might translate it as I already done Gangsta and Ushio and Tora but it'll need me some motivation. If I pull an all-nighter then it might be up for tomorrow before 9a.m.<br>I'll see.</br></br>  <br><br>Every thread. Just watching the first episode from beginning to end would clear up all these incorrect assumptions, you know.</br></br>  The OP and ED were great.  <br>She is not your waifu, she is a ctulhu abomination!</br>  <br>Yes it is like LogHorizon but with good writing.Now fuck off.</br>  <br>That's Shalltear anon, we're still not sure what Albedo's true form is.</br>    <br>Please do it anon, I'll love you forever. I can't stand funi.</br>  <br>to be honest, first ep is very similar to Log Horizon's. except skelly is alone</br>  Why is she so creepy? The yandere vibes are so strong.  <br> He's the boy. <br> Cuter than her sister. <br>EVERY FUCKING TIME.<br><br>I thought it was okay I mean if its just NPC's that are still around and not other players I can't see it being decent.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this new season of Bleach?</br>  <br>If Shalltear is to be believed, her true form is a gorilla.</br>  <br>She is some sort of Gorilla monster, /a/non. We already went through it. The only ones who are not abominations are probably some of the maids and the elves.</br>  <br>that could just be a normal insult she throws around at Albedo, besides a gorilla would be a pit plain.</br>  <br>Best ED of the season.</br>  <br><br>Don't troll me /a/nons.</br></br>  <br><br>Pls go, Shalltear.</br></br>  Did an scene of Cocytus fighting the lizards appear in the OP?<br> Are we getting that volume animated?</br>  <br>He's a skirt wearing determined man, who would rape a female to produce offspring if Mobonga ordered it.</br>  <br>Truly. Well they could sneak it back in next ep's intro before Sebas arrives, but I doubt it.</br>  Is this going to mean more interest in the LN and possibly faster translations?<br><br> please </br></br>   draw a girl <br> call it a boy <br><br> draw a boy <br> call it a girl <br><br>Why is this allowed?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends on how it is made. Here is an exemple of a simple Gorilla zombie, so-bin is 100 times better so expect some ctulhu abomination.</br>  <br>Because of that one line in her description.</br>  <br>She wants skeleton bone</br>  Does the snake girl even have a vagina? like how the fuck do you fuck any of these monster girls? if you cant waht s the point of being around them?  <br>because it creates balance man.</br>  <br>It also had Sebas in capital and Demiurge playing the villain with him from 5/6 vol. And all in wrong gear, Cocytus and Ainz too with Shalltear.</br>   funishit <br>When they will die? Somebody has to stop them until they taken over everything.</br>  <br>wait which one of them are we talking about here?</br>  <br> So is this going to be two cour or are they just teasng LNfags?</br>  Someone asked if Sebas had a stats page last thread.  <br>Before this, you should ask if the Lich has a dick.</br>  <br> Solution's total level is 57 <br>isn't that a lot higher then most of the maids?</br></br>  <br> Non negative <br>Sebas is the hero we need.</br></br>  <br>Madhouse is hit and miss. I wasn't too happy to see them working on OPM because it's really hard to predict if that means it'll be good or bad. It's 50-50.</br>  <br>Hopefully just teasing after running out of ideas for OP. I damn hope so. 2 cour is too far-fetched with the announced 6 BD volumes and cramming all 6 volumes into 13 episodes would be lunacy.</br>  Wait, dont his real life body need water, sleep or food?  <br>She didn't call him a gorilla, right?<br><br>Shalltear was called a lamprey and Albedo was called some kind of starfish. That's what I remember from the LN translation.</br></br></br>  <br>I doubt it. They're the last defense before the throne. Sebas himself is 100</br>  <br>Isn't cocytus positive too?</br>  <br> skelly bones is his real body now </br>  <br>Supposedly some stuff was lost during the conversion from japanese to chinese.</br>  <br> but they aint in a video gam worl they really are in middle earth just everything still works like a vid gam so its different see that means that vid gam world is rel world Anime A+ you just have shit taste IIRC troll trying to turn /a/ into a meme board. <br><br>Log Horizon fans need to get out, they're worse than any other fanbase on this board.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah but ainz said that the maid's aren't actually good for that. if someone makes it past the 8th then it's basically gg no rz for team Nazarick</br>  <br>If we take that the mind defines who we are, then his old body is just a shell now and the floating skeletal parts is his real body.</br>  <br> His real body doesn't need anything of that,  since skeletons don't need to drink sleep or eat. </br>  <br> implying anyone could even make it past the first floor </br>  <br> but with good writing <br><br>Try again, hog.</br></br></br>  <br>You've had a big misunderstanding. It's not that they aren't strong in their own right. It's that Victim's floor is their strongest defense. If a raid party managed to get past that, they're strong enough to get past Sebas and the Pleiades.</br>  <br>Mr. Bones is still there you fool.<br><br> If his old guild was still good, there be 41 niggas just like him standing in the throne room. </br></br></br>  Oh and isn't skeletons considered as "gore" in china? this would never pass there. We joke about people skelingtons being them spooky shiiit.<br><br>I cant believe people think of them as scary though, no matter how you try to portray them.</br></br>  <br> he's a skeleton. skeletons dont need to drink, sleep, or eat. </br>  <br>there was that one 1.5k zerg rush</br>  <br> They made it up to the 8th floor I think and then died to the holy magic fetus.</br>  <br>Huh, what's this from? Are these actual skellies or are they only dressed up as one?</br>  <br>I'm sure he has one. If not he can always make one with <br> dank magic </br></br>  <br> holy magic fetus <br>Why is Tabula so weird?</br></br>  best thing ever created by madhouse thanks to a double combo<br>1<br>total immersion thanks to being able to relate to the mc as a pathetic loner that has spent too many hours playing games <br>2<br>caters to my escapism in every way imaginable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That wizard is fucking riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiipppped</br>  Easily AOTS  Who are the bunch of faggots who appear after KATANA STRONK guy in the OP? The king and his court? Blue Rose?  Will redo once it airs on a different channel.  <br>How can you master the mind without mastering the body as well?</br>  <br>Based.</br>  <br>At least Madhouse understands the people's needs.</br>  I do love the dissonance between Momonga's normal (and pathetic) human voice, with which he still thinks, and his deeper lich voice whenever he talks once he was transported to the fantasy world.  <br>The arms peddler manga.<br><br>Altough there is one scene I forgot why the female main character did it, its extremely disturbing and makes her into a fucking cunt.</br></br></br>  <br>Did they even make it? Kind of looks like so-bin's art style.</br>  <br>Noice.</br>  <br>They added it int. Director asked him to make it.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure that Madhouse just had so-bin do the art for the ED.</br>  <br> Succubus blood </br>  <br>Kiba no Tabishounin, huh? Might read it (though the last update seems to be December, last year). What would you say is good about it?</br>   Tfw no busty servant will ask if you want to sex her right in the throne room   <br><br>Cute design wasted on a trap, blah. I'm starting to be convinced that half the otakus in Japan are gay.</br></br>  <br>He's a skeleton now, skeletons don't need any of that.</br>   yfw madhouse killed overlord   <br>Mo...momonga?</br>  I need a webm of laughing skelington in the OP.  <br>They all are</br>  <br>What about his teammates thats also from the real world?</br>  <br>Moemonga.</br>  <br> butthurt LH/SAO fan <br>Get out of here.</br></br>  <br>he is in an mmo now but the mmo is a real world except everything works exactly like it did in the mmo except it's a real world which is a good twist but he doesnt need to worry because he is the best of all mmo players in the whole entire world and the most powerful player in this mmo which is actually a real world that works exactly like an mmo which is a clever twist and all of the women love him it is such a good plot.</br>  Papa Bones sitting all alone in the hall. I did not ask for these feels.  It's a decent first episode, i hope the death knight battle goes as described in the LN, gory and hyphy as fuck  <br>They're in the real world. You didn't see his giant fucking empty meeting room?</br>   get transported to world with hot, obedient demon girls <br> be a skeleton and have no dick <br><br>This is like ultimate suffering. Reminds me of Time Enough at Last.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, they coudnt kill Marvel, also they tried multiple times. So not all hope is lost.</br>  I need pictures, pirctures of spiderma- erh, I mean, I need pictures of the characters that I can use to replace these ones with for a better wallpaper.<br><br>Also, anybody has a good Victim pic? the ones I saw in the LN so far are awful. Pandora Actor's sheet is meh and I haven't even seen Gargantua yet.<br><br>Will include them into the wallpaper as they appear, I guess, but since Gargantua hasn't appeared at all in the WN or LN (as far as i've read), it may take a while<br><br>Meanwhile, have this</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What teammates? He and the ex-npcs are the only ones there.</br>  <br>I'm going to sleep now and setting subs ripping, so if Senketsu won't rip, or anon won't translate... But I hope to hell that anon will translate, because funi subs is just shit regardless if they hardsubed or not.</br>  <br>Both of those shows suck too and all have terrible writing just like this one and you're stupid for liking it and I'm going to break the bike your dad bought for you.</br>  <br> He is searching for them or any other YGGDRASIL player that might have been sent to that world but he hasn't found anyone so far.<br> There is evidence of players showing up in that world and fucking sht up many centuries before Ainz did.</br></br>  <br>how else can we get traps then?</br>    What is wrong with the frame rates? Every now and then in some scenes it goes really slow for some reason. Is this only happening to me?  <br> the best of all mmo players in the whole entire world and the most powerful player in this mmo <br>He's a midtier scrublord with a fucked build that relied on pay to win cash items and connections, he was basically a janitor in his guild since all he did was admin stuff.</br></br>  <br>no its madhouse being shit and fucking up the pan</br>  <br> You will never be this happy </br>  <br>I thought the same, but it's not just you.</br>  Jesus christ I could listen to Yumi Hara for all eternity.  <br>Did he do it for free?</br>  <br>It's just typical Funimation being garbage. The raws were fine.</br>  <br>So it wasn't just me.</br>  <br>I loved it a lot and it has potential.<br>Fucking funamation shit though those fucking frame rate drops.<br>The raw is perfectly fine.</br></br></br>  <br>I read it mostly for the art and some character design since im an artist myself.</br>  It was ok.  Shame, this show could have been good without the awkward fanservice thrown in to appease the NEETs.  <br>No he is the best mmo player in the entire world of moo games even more than Shoero and Kirito combined into one mmo person who is the second best at playing mmos because this skeleton man is the best mmo player of all time he cannot be winned against he is the best written character in the best written show of the decade it is so good that such a great anime studio such as medhouse can make this anime an A+</br>  <br>having guilds you loved empty really do feel like shit.</br>  <br>Happens with CR and Funi. Watch raws.</br>   most powerful player in this mmo  <br>but he wasn't.The guild was pretty notorious, yes, but he had a rp/pvp build that was pretty sub optimal and needed shitloads of support. his main job was probably debuff/controll from the look of his skills</br>  <br><br>I'm getting mixed signals here. Is it Funi or Madhouse fault?</br></br>  Demiurgos best guardian.  <br> Don't even reply, it's just one autist sperging shit for the sake of shitposting.</br>  The actual story is that MC had an Dive-shock, half of his brain is fried and he is a paralized hallucinating vegetable in a hospital. He cant find any other players since there arent any - its not a game, nor real world.<br><br>Later medics attempt to recover his concious, but for him it looks like enemies attacking his hold, so he repells them repeatedly.</br></br>  <br>And only one nigga answered your call for a last get together.</br>  <br>Funi.</br>  <br>Dude just say "crow control"</br>  no he is the best mmo player of all time nobody is better than him and he plays all the video game sjust like you do he plays the dragon crown quest games and the table reference games he knows all the references to video games just like you do and he is not a player who is simple to beat because of his tricky clever writing he is the most powerful character to ever exist.  <br>Watch Funi. Watch Raw. Then decide.</br>  <br>this nigga ain't itachi tho</br>  <br>Senketsu won't rip it (https://senketsusubs.wordpress.com<wbr>/2015/06/30/senketsu-subss-summer-2<wbr>015-hardsub-ripping-plans/).<br><br>Also not only the panning are shit but also fine details (mostly text and fine lineart) are jerky, look at the credit during OP/ED</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>crowd*</br>  <br>doesn't look like it worked since he has no body left.</br>  Imagine the blowjobs.  <br>i really want an SOL about Demiurge trying to set up a human ranch outside Nazarick, I wanna see it so bad</br>  <br> implying people shitposting even know what it means </br>  <br>heh heh it'll be a "slice" of life for sure</br>  really good original anime    <br>Don't you mean bipedal sheep?</br>  <br> MAL </br>  Do NPCs suspect he is not one of them, aka not proper evil overlord Momonga, and try to rebel?  <br>Shit writing<br>Shit setting<br>Shit fanbase<br>Shit memes<br>God tier women</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>don't worry, Ainz isn't here anon, we can talk freely.</br>  <br>Why would they rebel?<br><br>Ainz-sama's word is law~</br></br></br>   "Internet Trolls aren't real. You can just turn them off."  <br>The people who made Gatchman Crowds are clearly unaware of this place's existance.</br>  <br>I think Anon is talking about this.</br>  Is Hajime the genkiest?  <br>She doesn't hate you.<br><br>As a normalfag she's just completely unaware of your existence. To her, you literally do not exist beyond some kind of vague concept.</br></br></br>  <br>If she cannot survive as a human being she must seek to survive as an animal.</br>  <br>The problem though is that Hajime will not likely ever face a bully. Sure's she's an oddball and stuff, but she one's of those people that are so good looking that people will ignore any annoying part of her and instead just go out of their way to help her. She's capable of living a life blissfully unaware of any real problem or existential suffering.<br><br>I bet she even vote Green.</br></br></br>  How did this garbage get such a large fanbase?  Just like how attack on titan and sword art online did. Plebs are easy to please.  <br>Nothing quite like a good old-fashioned yandere to get plebs' hopes up.</br>  Babby's first yandere  <br>Ask MALtards.</br>  <br>Was it that bad?<br>And his harem filled with shitheads and gays is quite popular. Reminiscent of evangelion. Because that had a crazy and gay in it as well.</br></br>  you said it yourself, because it is garbage.  <br>Yuno is love<br>Yuno is life</br></br>  Fun things are fun, OP  <br> because you touch yourself at night </br>  <br><br> Yandere <br>Kill yourselves.</br></br></br>  <br>Search your feelings. You know it to be true.</br>  Babby's first yandere  Because purple hair girl best girl, and no I don't mean the pink one you faggot.  <br>Yuno is Yangire, not Yandere. If they try to sound so smart, they should atleast get their terminology right.</br>  because it's good  <br><br>No.. she's a Yandere, have you even watched the show?</br></br>  <br> mc gets shit done <br><br>hurrr anime is bad</br></br></br>  whats wrong with the show besides the fact that its popular  <br>its OST is over 12 cd's</br>  It was bad, but it kept me entertained.<br><br>That's all I can ask for in the twilight years of human civilization.</br></br>  <br> this meme again <br>she is yandere, stop regurgitating what 4chan tells you</br></br>  <br>Yuno how.</br>  <br>Though the series could have become a disturbing thriller revolving around the relationship between Yuno and her target of warped affection, Yuki, the rest of the series actively subverts this core piece of drama by being stupid. The show features a gothic lolita terrorist who can summon motorcycles from under her dress, a blind man who fancies himself as a member of the Power Rangers, and a four year old kid with an unusual fascination of puppets. If this were an ordinary shounen action series, such embellishments would have been fine, but for a show driven by the dynamic between Yuno and Yuki, it throws a titanium wrench into the gears and drags the whole concept to a dead stop.<br><br>A strong lead character could have compensated for the absurdities, but after the sheer sense of terror that Yuno commands dissipates, it becomes apparent that the lead protagonist is not impotent out of fear, but instead is a natural pushover. This, mixed with the aforementioned silliness, turns the remaining twenty-odd episodes into a giant mess of interesting but poorly executed ideas.</br></br></br>  Lowest common denominator pandering to edgy children<br><br>She cut the kid's head off isn't that so dark and gruesome and COOL!</br></br>  <br>Why is the creator of the dream diary playing in the second game and not the first?</br>  <br>  Bullies an anon  <br>  Doesn't realize he's mixing up yangire with yandere. </br></br>  <br> natural pushover <br><br>he is a fucking middle school kid<br><br>have you seen what a middle school kid looks and acts like?<br><br>you should know as you apparently you are still in school</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It appeals to idiots for some reason.</br>  It's like a modern day Elfen Lied  <br>...He created it in both worlds, most likely. The 2nd world is the same as the first, up until the point where Yuno commits forceful suicide.</br>  <br>The blind guy was great, he was one of the few sources of lighthearted action scenes right at the point where the show gets dark enough to use gang rape as backstory and a threat. The kid is kind of weird, but wouldn't it make sense that God could find the weirdest, smartest possible kid and let him join the game? There are 7 year olds and such that graduate college in reality, it's not too much of a stretch to say a kid chosen by god with a future predicting device couldn't do some crazy shit.<br><br>The one thing I don't let slide is the pillsbury doughboy woman. Why the fuck did they make her look like that? It served no purpose and just made some serious scenes silly.</br></br></br>  <br>Not that anon, but she doesn't have a dere bone in her whole body. Yukiteru is just an object to her and she's more than willing to kill him off to get what she wants.</br>  <br>Bullshit. She created another world just to be with him, because nothing in the world without Yuki is worth as much as Yuki is to her. The amusement park episode shows she's clearly got some dere in her. She would play the game an unlimited number of times and kill an unlimited number of the players in order to spend another cycle with Yuki over and over again.</br>  <br>Except it was even more shitty.</br>  because it has a cute girl who is literally obsessed with a loser kid and would do anything for him. lots of otaku self-insert. same reason why people love the robot girl from persona, free cute girl who they don't have to work to obtain.  <br>I dunno. MN definitely got a lot more stupid plotwise but I think Lied is worse in terms of shitty characterization and grimdark pandering.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>All replies from probable haremshitters. You're willing to let things slide when it's in a genre you naturally prefer, but when it's not then you immediately come down on the show as if it's the worst thing you've ever watched. It begs the question of why you even bothered watching in the first place.<br><br>I don't like haremshit due to it's retarded protags, flimsy plots, and stock characters so I stay away. You do so you watch and forgive these aspects.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I loved it because it was suspenseful, unexpected, it had characters that made for surprising events, the characters also had interesting motives despite them being obviously exaggerated, etc.<br><br>In other words, I loved all the positive aspects of it, and its flaws were things I could overlook and just accept as an author's choice when creating fiction. It didn't try to be realistic at all and that was amusing.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought the same at first, but episode 10.5 saved EL for me.</br>  <br>You are projecting so hard right now I could rig you up and play powerpoint presentations</br>  <br>Also I cared for the characters and specially for Yuno, Minene, and Akise, so the things that happened after the trainwreck were a blast for me. It also helped a lot that they were unpredictable.</br>  Fun fact - /a/ loved this manga and Yuno until it got an Anime adaptation and became more widespread and popular.  <br>So the same treatment it gives everything that gets popular?</br>  <br> moving goalposts <br>That's sad.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's actually in some of /a/'s non-troll recommendation charts.</br>  <br>It has a fanbase still?<br>The ending was so fucking terrible</br></br>  <br> didn't like his favorite shit <br> must be haremshitter <br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe because the second half of it was ass but it was too late to form a new opinion after cosigning it.</br>  <br>You mean the ending that was forshadowed from the literal first scene of the anime, that perfectly explained the events without creating more plotholes? It didn't seem terrible to me, in fact it made Yuno make sense, something a different plot twist couldn't do.</br>  <br>Typical /a/ then.</br>  Because<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sK4<wbr>an5sJCcQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>He provides an argument with solid point why wouldnt he? Its not like OP question does matter much.<br><br>You are the sad guy here Haremfags.</br></br></br>  <br> Samefagging <br> Referring to yourself as "he" to make it look like you're not <br>Please go</br></br></br>  <br>As long as you know deep down you're a haremshitter with poor taste, that's all that matters.</br>  <br> He provides an argument with solid point <br> if you don't like Mirai Nikki then you're all harem fanatics <br>For fuck's sake anon.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Where's the dere? The only Yuno that could be dere is the third, but when talking about Yuno you usually talk about the first, and there is not a single dere bone in that body, she'd kill every Yuki of every dimension without batting an eye.</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=v5p<wbr>bT16G4lU</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qOY<wbr>Ytcd8spo</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Call me names but I loved everything about it. I've rewatched it once already and plan to do it again.</br></br></br></br>  To be honest though the thing I remember most about this show is that it took me five weeks to realize the second OP was sung in english.  <br>The first Yuno was clearly dere in the amusement park. The scene with the straws is 100% dere, for example.</br>  <br>He's right.<br><br>Mirai Nikki had a strong dedicated fan base on /a/ while the manga was being scanlated. Why? Because it was fun.</br></br></br>  <br> fun <br><br>get that shit out of here, anime is serious buisness and nothing but the most fag-worthy content is posted here. That's why we still get shitty waifu threads 12 times a day.</br></br></br>  <br>Mirai Nikki is entertaining. And Yuno is the yandere queen.</br>  <br>That's not the actual dialogue, is it? Normally I wouldn't consider it real for a second, but considering the backstory of the 6th and what she orders her men to do to Yuno...</br>  <br> How did this garbage get such a large fanbase? <br><br>Next generation's Elfen Lied</br></br></br>  <br>She is a miracle of the universe, and there will never be another like her.<br><br>Why is Yandere so underused? Why is Tsunshit everywhere?</br></br></br>  <br>He never said or implied that</br>  <br>Its not</br>  <br><br>The ending is fixed in the OVA.</br></br>  <br>I see... so there's nothing wrong with the serie :</br>  <br>CARTOON FOR KIDS!<br><br>WOAH!<br><br> Is it really? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Edgy kids I'd say.</br>  <br>I really enjoyed it up to 11th comes in, but the end was okay with the ova</br>  It was sort of a wild ride. I don't know why /a/ hates it so much, there is worse shit every season. It had nice op/ed and overall ost, also the terrorist chick with eyepatch was great. I know the fanbase is pretty cancer, but so is the fanbase of every popular show. It's not the greatest and smartest adult show ever, but no one really claimed it to be one. Only question is why you passionately hate this but love every other shit show that Japan produces every season.  The hammer was stupid  <br><br>It's much easier to oversee the bad parts in a manga. Like the MC.</br></br>  Friendly reminder that gasai yuno figurine when is dead.  Can we please celebrate Killua's birthday?  <br>He already had a celebration earlier.</br>  <br>I missed it. And it's not like the birthday is over.</br>  <br>People may have missed that anon</br>  <br> I want to protect that smile </br>  <br><br>best boy</br></br>  <br><br>worst boy</br></br>  Isn't he a slut boy?  <br><br>gay boy</br></br>  At least post his manga design. He looks like shit in the anime.  <br>I just wanted to say that hisoka is shit</br>  <br>Happy birthday to best boy.</br>  <br>Didn't that thread get pruned?</br>  FUCKING PRESS THE BUTTON YOU FUCKING MIDGET<br><br>FUCK</br></br>  FUCKING KILL HIM ALREADY FUCKING MANLET<br><br>FUCK</br></br>  The Cell saga was great because it outed everyone's character flaws. <br><br>In the end, it was a culmination of everyone's faults that the situation escalated the way it did. None of the relevant characters were completely innocent.</br></br>  <br> The Cell saga was great because it outed everyone's character flaws. <br>Krilin had never the character flaw that he couldn't kill anyone.</br></br>  <br>but he has sex with her instead</br>  <br><br>What did Tenshinhan and Piccolo do wrong?</br></br>  <br>Piccolo sacrificed the dragon balls so he could be strong.<br><br>Tenshinhan didn't know when to fold em.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Piccolo's pride led him to challenging #17 and #18 on his own, which eventually led Cell to them when he had no way of finding them otherwise.<br><br>The argument could be made that he had no choice, considering they came to him, but considering their ultimately thrill seeking personalities there were other options he could have taken. <br><br> Tenshinhan <br> Relevant </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey, he held off imperfect cell long enough for 16 &amp; 18 to hide.<br>That's more than any other side character did.</br></br>  Why does anyone think Kuririn is the strongest human when Tenshinhan exists? He was always stronger than the midget, in every instance of the series except maybe when Kuririn got the powerup on Namek.  <br> Top Tier Waifu or saving the world. <br>Hey, he made the right choice</br></br>  <br><br>Kuririn is stronger specifically because he got the powerup on Namek. <br><br>Before that the official power levels from the Vegeta battle had Kuririn and Tenshinhan on about equal terms, but from that point Kuririn had surpassed him.</br></br></br></br>  He's a good guy, not a bad guy. Though the androids didn't exactly start off heroic in the present timeline, they were hardly the monsters they were in the alternate future.<br><br>Cold-blooded murder is a bit unheroic with that in mind, even if it would have prevented Perfect Cell.<br><br>Both androids contribute to the defeat of Buu via the Spirit Bomb, so it was probably for the best that they survived anyway.<br><br><br>Piccolo decided to fight a 2-on-1 with the Androids instead of waiting for reinforcements. Since the androids don't emit Ki but Piccolo does, Cell finds them much more quickly. Had piccolo waited for Tien or pretty much anybody else, one or both androids would have been destroyed before cell showed up.<br><br>Tien didn't do anything wrong, but he is also basically the least relevant Z-fighter in the entire set bar Yamcha and Chiaotzu. His only appearance of note is to stop cell, which is important, but he's hardly a major player.<br><br><br>Krillin is stronger post-namek due to the power-up.<br><br>Most of the misconception about their comparative strengths stems from the use of their signature techniques during the Cell Saga. Tien is able to hold off semi-perfect cell with the Neo Tri-Beam (a technique that is vastly stronger than conventional attacks because it's chipping away at his life.)<br><br>Meanwhile, Krillin's disk fails to harm Perfect Cell, who is exponentially stronger.<br><br>Neither of them do too much in actual combat from there on out as they take a backseat to the saiyans and the like.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tien's tri-beam was square.</br>  <br>try to form a triangle with your hands</br>  <br>His flaw was that he prioritized getting some pussy.<br> Can't blame him. </br></br>  <br>I don't really think it will make a difference. Even if krillin deactivate her. Cell can still absorb her lifeless corpse turning him into his perfect form.</br>  <br> Meanwhile, Krillin's disk fails to harm Perfect Cell, who is exponentially stronger. <br>Wasn't in the manga.<br><br>Anyway, Tenchinhan kept training well into the Buu saga, where he even stepped in to save Goku or Gohan, don't remember which one, and he survived a kick by Super Buu. Which was when Krillin was an old fuck because he went home and was a family man.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I kinda hated the fact that Kai made the energy disc useless against stronger enemies. It was kinda neat to know that Krillin had at least this ace up his sleeve since it seems to be his technique.</br>  <br>Why is Krillin such a faggot?<br> She killed thousands <br> Trunks told us of a future where she and her brother hunt humanity to the brink of extinction <br> But she's so pretty! <br><br>At least Yamcha's faillures are due to his lack of skill, not due to him being a fucking retard.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's just a case of someone telling you who the next Hitler is going to be so be sure to kill him except future-Hitler is now a pretty girl that you can use smooth-moves no jutsu on to change the future.</br></br>  <br>DBZ itself is a series about retarded people always doing the wrong decisions in the worst situations.</br>  <br>Except you already see her going on full rampage, so there no disambiguity about her maybe be innocent and Krilin doesn have smooth-moves no jutsu.</br>  <br>Blame the retarded dub,the original name of that attack is meant to be something along the lines of "Ultimate Kikoho".</br>  <br> except future-Hitler is now a pretty girl that you can use smooth-moves no jutsu on to change the future <br>Krillin was just as old as Goku (who had a son and a second bun in the oven) and was a virgin who had only one girlfriend before... in filler. What made him think he could pull off smooth talk no jutsu reliably enough to change the future?<br><br>He's a fucking beta, that's it. Even Yamcha would've just pushed the button (though with his luck it would fall out of his hands and slide towards 17 and 18).</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well that's because he's never been in a position that he COULD kill someone</br>  <br>Present #18 have not killed thousands, they spared life ov every human they met on their path, just threated them, destroyed cars nd stuff. The ones who killed thousands were Cell and future androids, basically it could mean that present cell who were killed before he was born, could be potentially a good guy.</br>  Imagine how Trunks felt all the way through the Cell Saga. He beheld how everybody was fucking up on purpose despite his best efforts, they could have killed Cell and the androids like 5 times, and not only they didn't, in the case of Vegeta he even stopped Trunks from doing it himself. I bet he was really close to just say, "ok fuck off everybody, I'm goin' back to my timezone, hope you all get killed by Cell."  <br> Piccolo <br> side character <br>But I don't blame you anon, I blame that fucking saiyan powercreep</br></br></br>  <br>Remember Piccolo doing literally nothing during whole Buu arc?</br>  <br>Well he felt for Gotenkst bluff and blew up the hyperbolic bullshitchamber.<br><br>Not that it helped them.</br></br></br>  <br> Even Yamcha would've just pushed the button (though with his luck it would fall out of his hands and slide towards 17 and 18). <br><br>It's funny because that probably would happen.</br></br></br>  The androids-cell saga was way better than freezer saga. That's a fact.  <br>What? He's the one who ran shit next to Goku during the whole time. He was just not powerful enough to fight.</br>  <br>If it is a fact, there must be a Wiki site to it.<br>She it to me.</br></br>  <br>I'm afraid you don't know what a fact is. Also, you are a massive pleb.</br>  <br>how easy would have been.<br>-stop her<br>-drop her in the bottom of the ocean.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm a massive pleb because my opinion isn't the same as the majority?</br>  <br> -stop her <br>wat<br>he was going to make her explode.</br></br></br>  <br>pretty sure the remote was to stop her. then he could destroy her.</br>   Tien <br> relevant </br>  <br>Androids didn't have a stop button, only a self-destruct device.</br>  <br>so it means krillin was in a suicide mission? pretty sure the explosion would have killed him at that range.</br>  <br>This arc was just made of bullshit, whole conflict could've be resolved at the moment Trunks said them that Gero makes androids. Whole arc consists of "WHY", because actions of characters are so fucking dumb that you start to doubt in author's sanity.</br>  <br>except that's wrong</br>  <br>And it all started when they took the stupid decision of fighting the androids because muh pride/fun</br>  <br>I am sure he is fast enough to escape an explosion.</br>  <br> suicide mission <br><br>Death in DBZ is just another way to say "hello". I believe they repeated line "we can ressurect everybody with dragonballs in Buu arc for 3 times per episode", magical wishing balls completely lost their original concept and became fucking scroll of resurrection.</br></br></br>  <br>Trunks was the only person who did nothing wrong in the Cell arc (besides maybe Tien, but unfortunately, he doesn't really matter). <br>He still got his ass kicked, but it was just because of too much power level bullshit. <br><br> Vegeta's saiyan pride <br>Why was that even a thing? The whole Namek arc Vegeta was all about sneaking around, trying to avoid Freeza and his stronger subordinates. And he was absolutely terrified of the thought of Frieza having transformation power ups. Why would he give Cell the opportunity to power up when he's always been about ruthlessly beating the shit out of enemies before they realize what hit them?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He got full of himself after dyeing his hair blond.<br><br> muh legendary power </br></br></br>  <br>He was like <br> AHAHHA I FINALLY SURPASSED KAKAROT <br> HEHEHEHE STRONGEST IN THE UNIVERSE <br><br>All super saiyans are retards.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No, no. The control was to stop her. At the point it appears we didn't even knew about the bomb yet.</br></br>  <br>Stupid manlets. Why do they have to ruin everything?</br>  <br>You're such a dumb boy.</br>  <br>so you're saying he does push the button?</br>  <br>Both have their merits. Vegeta wasn't really all that much of a good character until the later chapters of Cell, even though he has been around almost since Raditz.</br>  <br>They had a stop button before, but C17 destroyed it and killed Gero.</br>  <br>Remember vegeta?</br>  <br>That was Goku's doing.</br>  <br>once deactivated krillin was supposed to destroy her body</br>   Krillen is tapping this fine piece of ass   I'm looking for a good place to torrent DBZ episodes, preferably the original ones and not the Kai remasters. Can some nice poster please spoonfeed me?  Is he called vegetto or gogeta?<br>The manga said vegetto but in one of those movies I was just watching it was gogeta</br>  <br>There's one called Vegeto and one called Gogeta.<br>Vegeto appears when using the potara, Gogeta when doing the fusion dance.</br></br>  <br>Vegetto is the portara fusion, Gogeta is the fusion dance fusion. Different characters.<br><br>I always found it iritating how in the anime Vegeta said "I will never fuse bodies with you again!" when being offered the portara, even though no one in my country had watched Fusion Reborn at that point and no one knew about Gogeta.</br></br></br>  <br>Gogeta is fusion through the dance. They never actually did it that way in the manga - only the movie. Vegetto is what was done through the earings.</br>  <br>Can't blame him, 18 was fucking perfect.<br><br>Blame the other manlet, who was supposed to obliterate the bug with his new super cool powers.</br></br></br>  so why did the present androids not kill everyone?<br>Was it because of 16?</br>  <br><br><br>Ah, that was what I suspected<br>They both have awful fashion sense though, and it would have been far cooler if he fused with the green guy</br></br></br></br>  <br>The fashion comes from the method of fusion. They don't choose to be clothed like that.</br>   We can use the Dragonballs to find Dr. Gero and kill him before he makes the Androids <br>Nope<br> Bulma knows the fucking location of Dr. Geros lab, you dont even need the fucking dragonballs <br>Nope<br> You will die in three years time Goku, please take this medicine and use it before then <br>Nope<br> Atleast keep it on you, if the need arrives <br>Nope<br> Piccolo now stronger than ever have cornered a bug monster with dangerous potential, he should be stronger or equeal to it and even have backup on the way, dont loose it <br>Nope<br> To fucking solar flare, a technique confirmed to be useless thanks to energy sensing <br>Nope<br> The androids are chasing Goku and Cell is chasing the Androids, we need to move Goku to a non-obvious place and lead the Androis on a chase away from Cell <br>Nope<br> Good Krillin you got her cornered now blow her up and stop Cell from becoming stronger <br>Nope, boner<br> Finish it Vegeta, dont let him become more powerfull <br>Nope, Saiyan pride<br> Cell may be stronger than us, but togheter we can take him <br>Nope, Saiyan Pride<br> Cell is exhausted after his fight with Goku, quick Gohan finish him <br>Nope, Saiyan pride<br> Goku please take a senzu, Cell might spam minimees that can kill us <br>Nope, braindamage<br> Finish it Gohan, you vastly outpowers him <br>Nope, Saiyan pride<br> Why dont you spam more minimees Cell? In your new powerfull state they should easily protect your back <br>Nope, Saiyan genetic pride</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Buu saga wasn't much better.<br> let's not kill Babidi on sight despite having three SSJ2 monsters in a team <br> as SSJ3 I have a chance to defeat Buu, but I won't kill him because I want kids to have a chance of fighting an ancient evil :^) <br> let's not use The Room of Spirit and Time until it's too late <br> let's not use fusion or Potara earrings to defeat Kid Buu because muh pride <br> let's not wish resurrected Gohan back to the Sacred World of the Kais despite him being far stronger than Kid Buu </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just heard every single line of greentext in  abridged  Trunk's voice</br>  <br> &gt;as SSJ3 I have a chance to defeat Buu, but I won't kill him because I want kids to have a chance of fighting an ancient evil :^) <br> That bullshit from goku is the reason why I love hate the arc so much </br></br>  <br>Then Bulma made a new stop button.</br>  <br>tien was the only character who saved the day, and his only flaw was he still believed he could surpass goku, because toriyama doesnt want to powerup the fucking HUMANS</br>  <br>i was watching it, 17 and 18 technically didn't kill anyone except gero. I think the context missing is that gero fucks with them and turns them into killing machines during the future timeline. So they weren't ready yet because they were not controlled by gero.</br>  <br>Read that conversation again.</br>  <br><br><br>Present day 18 wasn't as violent as future 18, she didn't kill anyone for the entire duration of the arc. She could have killed Vegeta, Piccolo, Tenshinhan and Krillin himself but didn't do it.<br><br>And the most important part: Krillin wanted to fuck her. His actions were justified and rewarded at the end as he successfully tapped that, so everyone wins.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Seriously? Piccolo union with Kami was done for necessity, not for pride, he was disgusted of this union.</br></br>  <br>Let's not forget<br> be a genius able to produce cyborgs far stronger than Frieza <br> have only one safety system that is a remote with a big button </br></br></br>  <br>To some degree maybe, but more so because they weren't as 'evil' as the future versions. The common theory as far as I know is that Trunks traveling back in time changed a lot just from being present. This is presumably because Gero's little bot that sucks DNA out of people took Trunks' as well. As a result he had to compensate for that while working on them, which while making them stronger than their future counterparts also put them 'behind schedule'. This also explains why Gero and 19 showed up instead.</br>  <br> basically it could mean that present cell who were killed before he was born, could be potentially a good guy. <br>This reminds me that in one of the DBZ games' endings after Goku beat Cell he spared him and then Cell came back as a good guy.</br></br>  <br> Chichi dies <br> Goku doesn't give a single fuck <br> Whatever we can resurrect her later <br> While Vegeta, a fellow saiyan is always ready to defend his wife and children even through they have convenient ways of bringing back the dead <br><br>I bet that if some villain was much stronger than Goku and Vegeta, and this villain threatened to kill their families, Goku would run away to train while leaving them to die, while Vegeta would die trying to protect them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They killed a bunch of people. They even shot one old guy in the face.</br></br>  <br> I bet they would leave their families to die <br>You act like anyone gives a fuck about death at this point.</br></br>  <br>That was future androids</br>  <br>Really? Hu. Alright.</br>   the potentially strongest being in the universe is more concerned about grades than saving his homeworld   <br> Gohanfags are still butthurt about Gohan finally being happy and fulfilling his dream <br>The worst part about "Gohanfags" is that they don't understand his character at all.</br></br>  <br>So are you saying that Bulma screwing over 16 by removing his bomb was a good thing or not?</br>  <br> Goes on to write Groundbreaking Science <br> Uses his potential to make the Earth a better place </br></br>  <br>What dreams even?<br>What has he done with his studies?<br>He hasn't invented or furthered anything in science. He's got a family and enjoys spending time with them, but that doesn't mean he can't still train every once in a while. And it's not like they're strapped for money since he's married to the daughter of an athlete millionaire.<br>He's pissing his potential away while reading books and pretending to be an intellectual, the dandy fuck.<br>The only useful thing he does for the planet is being a superhero when he can be bothered.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;What has he done with his studies? <br><br><br>I'm not even gonna bother reading the rest of your post.</br></br></br></br>  <br>His only flaw is not making Yamcha train with him during the 7 year timeskip.<br><br> that and not going into the room of spirit and time, fucking retard </br></br></br>  <br> the potentially strongest being in the universe should be concerned about getting even stronger </br>  <br>His dad will just save the day.<br><br>Or magical wish granting balls will fix any damages along the way, no one has any need to give a fuck about anything.</br></br></br>  <br> Krillin  <br> midget <br><br>Tenshinhan's living fleshlight is a midget, Krillin is just ultra-manlet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>B-But I can't self-insert as Gohan if he's an nerd! He should be strong and invincible just like I want to be! Waaaaaaah!</br>  <br>i hate unfinished mouths</br>  <br> At least Yamcha's faillures are due to his lack of skill <br><br>Don't forget the fact that he's cocky as shit. That's why he lost the Saibaman fight, he didn't double tap the motherfucker just because he was stronger than it.</br></br></br>  <br> Uses his potential to make the Earth a better place <br>And how has he done that? He hasn't invented shit.</br></br>  <br>when can barely go super saiyan, yes he should be worried about at least maintaining his strength</br>  <br>Hard to say<br><br>The common theory I've seen is that in the future, Goku's death made Gero decide to modify 17 and 18's minds for world domination<br><br>But in the present, he didn't get to tampering with their minds, so he had less control and their original personalities were more intact</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, this.<br><br>I mean, I could care less if Gohan wants to be the strongest in the universe or not, I'm not asking for him to train 24/7 like Vegeta and Goku but goddamn son at least stay /fit/.</br></br></br>  <br>He hates training and theres really no need for him to do it at all.</br>  <br>Why is it that Vegeta, when it comes to his romantic relationship, is more human than Goku? He actually LOVES Bulma, Trunks, and Bra, but Goku treats Chichi like a close friend who he occasionally has sex with, and his kids like potential sparring partners. Not saying he doesn't care for them, but holy shit.</br>  <br> He hates training <br>what? since fucking when?<br>if it weren't for chichi he wouldn't be concerned about studying at all</br></br></br>  <br>Goku is autistic he doesn't know what romance is.</br>  <br>Since he never wants to do it</br>  <br>Goku got hip pretty hard in the head when he was a kid.</br>   Goku accepts, respects and supports Gohan decisions and is happy for him because he's making his dream come to fruition <br> His "fans" do not </br>  <br>He was born as a low level Saiyan. He is no prince like Vegeta.</br>  <br>I literally came across this scene on youtube the other day. I chuckled a bit.</br>  he was fucking brainwashed by chi-chi <br>even videl liked his saiyan side more and was the reason she fell in love with him</br>  <br>He constantly avoided his studies to fool around every chance he got. When he was a kid he'd rather play with a gay dinosaur than study whatever the fuck Chichi was forcing him to.</br>  <br>Not really. Krillin should have hit the button and then wishes for 18 to come back as a human retard. He had the dragonballs.</br>  <br><br>Vegeta's pride was destroyed by Goku during the Freiza Saga, and Bulma was there to patch him up when he was at his lowest. So basically, Bulma and his family became his new pride.</br></br>  <br>Goku is a battle junkie monkey jungle boy. He was never taught how to be a proper human being.<br><br>Vegeta, despite being a cunt at first, had an actual hard life. His family represent the peace and respite he was never able to get before.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's also hilarious how little time has he actually spent with his family.</br>  <br>Rather than become stronger himself, he made the people of Earth stronger</br>  <br> A kid would rather play than study <br><br>More news at 11</br></br></br>  <br>Which is actually one of the biggest plotpoints everyone and their mom misses about the Boo saga. Even fucking Vegeta says so at the end, that Earthlings should take responsibility once in a while.<br><br>It's the same principle of why Goku wanted Goten and Trunks to beat Buu. It's why he decided to train Uub. Because he's not gonna be there forever to carry them.<br><br>Passing the torch to the next generation has always and forever been one of Dragon Ball biggest themes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and the first time it almost gets the earth destroyed and the second time it didn't worked at all</br>  <br>How old was Gohan during Namek, 6 or 7? He was 9 when he killed Cell.<br><br>Give the kid a fucking break</br></br></br>  <br>He got kidnapped by Raditz at 4 and spent 1 year with Piccolo and considering Freezer Saga was right after Saiyan Saga he was 5 when he went to Namek.</br>  <br> Earthlings should take responsibility once in a while <br>Responsibility for what?<br><br>The Sayians messes?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, Vegeta's pride was destroyed (along with his arm) during the android arc</br>  Why was Present-Android 17 &amp; 18 not as evil as the future ones? I don't think it was ever answered, at least not in the manga.  <br>What "messes" though? The strongest fucking enemyduring the whole dbz was right on earth before all saiyan intervention on the planet.</br>  <br>It also wasn't really answered why they were stronger or why C19 and C20 showed up. It's just time travel shenanigans I guess.</br>  <br>Beat me to it, I still wonder how future Trunks dealt with that situation</br>  <br>Buu got revived because of the Sayians. Hell Gohan got his energy drained in the first damn place because of the Kai's.<br><br>Cell and the androids was because of the Sayians, hell even Raditz and Vegeta were because of a Sayian.</br></br></br>  <br>If he kept training I can see him beating Dabura, if not their timeline is pretty much fucked.</br>  <br>damn 18 looks thick right there</br>  <br>Energy which could've been gathered elsewhere, saiyans were not needed for that. Gohan specifically provided a shitton of energy, but that's about it.</br>  <br> Beat me to it, I still wonder how future Trunks dealt with that situation <br>Took a time machine to the other timeline and brought Goku and Vegeta back with him to beat Buu. It was the plot to one of the games.</br></br>  <br><br><br>They made a game about it, it has a shit ton of bad ends but he goes back to the other timeline to get help, eventually gets ssj3 then wrecks buu</br></br></br>  <br>Buu got revived because of the fucking Kais who forced everyone's had to get Gohan drained. Had they not intervened everyone would have fucked Spopovich and the thin guy shit when they jumped at him.<br><br>If you are going to blame MUH SAIYAN PRIDE at least do it correctly.</br></br></br>  <br>Trunks timetravel caused a butterfly effect.</br>  <br><br>Name? I need this closure after years of mystery</br></br>  <br> Energy which could've been gathered elsewhere <br>Bullshit, there wasn't nearly enough energy on Earth aside from the Sayians.<br> The Kais are retarded <br> Goku and Vegeta treated it like a game <br> Vegeta went full retard </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One of those PSP games, Another Road IIRC</br>  <br>goku never had a family before besides grandpa gohan so he treats it different then vegeta who actually had a father and mother (i guess)</br>  Can we get together and stream Lucky Star?  <br>Why don't you stream it /a/non?</br>  <br>I'd like to watch Lucky Star with /a/.<br>Too bad I have some normalfag workshit I have to do.</br></br>  <br>I'm willing to. Just want to know who would show up.</br>  I'll show up, it's Tsukasas and Kagamis birthday afterall.  <br>Today is?</br>  <br>Yup.</br>    Lucky Star is dead set garbage. Literally the most painfully unfunny thing I've ever seen, and couldn't get past the first 30 seconds of episode 1.  <br>Then just set a time and date and open a "hey guys, I'm streaming!" thread.</br>  <br>I would show up. Just open a stream and make a thread announcing it.</br>  <br>yes ill show up</br>  <br>I was just about to watch for the first time so I guess I'll get in on this.</br>  <br>Everyone agrees with you. But the people who held out actually like the show because they changed directors after episode 5.</br>  <br>Now I feel bad that I'm not ready.</br>  I can and I want to watch it with you, guys!  Why do we hate her again?  <br> &gt;&gt;Not going nude in her body and running across a heavily populated area in the campus <br>this could fail easily<br><br> &gt;&gt;Not a getting a megaphone asking her to hold it, then possessing her to say that she likes big sweaty cocks in her mouth <br>this is pretty much possible, especially when she is the student body prez.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>power to sucking 5 dicks in the same time</br>  <br>She is smarter than him, I think she can outwit him easily in any of those</br>  <br>Making you cum without using her hands.</br>  <br> unless you are gay you wouldn't want to fuck someone like her. <br><br>Anon, you're a faggot, literally.</br></br></br>  Kohaku did nothing wrong.  <br>When was CCC released again? That was pretty much borderline and Nasu wrote it personally.</br>  Anyone know how Japan is taking the redesigns<br><br><br>Like 2 years ago<br><br>The final boss shoves the earth into her vagina</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*no longer<br><br><br>CCC was more of a fun joke than something "serious".<br>Besides there is a difference between actual sex and endless teasing and partial nudity. <br><br>CCC had no chill though. Didn't some chick shove a planet into her vagina or something?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  There is that quote about Tsukihime only having 18+ violence and nothing else, but it wasn't really an official confirmation so who knows. I really doubt we'll get H scenes but you never know. <br><br><br>Now they're only promoting RN.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to see the Dark Six. Satsujinki, Arc, Dante, etc vs Dark Six trying to destroy the world.</br>  Mein is perfectly ______________.  <br>Vegetative</br>  <br>mine</br>  <br>Kill.</br>  "Britain" survived just fine under the invading Anglo-Saxons and their later Norman conquerors. Why was she so obsessed with stopping that?  Her people were conquered and never ruled in their own right ever again. The Anglo-Saxons became the masters of Britain. <br><br>Why wouldn't she want to undo that?</br></br>  <br>Because it led to 'Britain' having one of the largest empires the world had ever seen?</br>  She's retarded, last time I checked Wales was doing fine.  <br><br><br>Have any of you actually been to Britain?<br>There are a lot of Muslims in some areas, but it's so overblown on the internet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know, everything would have been just peachy if Merlin didn't prop up some tiny blonde tart to fight the Saxons. It just led to more bloody warfare. And then there was a bunch of bloodshed because of her getting cuckolded and cloned. Literally everything would have been better if the magical futafag had just let the Saxons run the place.</br>  Show me your wisdom, /a/.  <br>Is there a tag for cum on food/drinks?</br>    <br>No idea.<br><br>http://ehwiki.org/wiki/Category:Tag<wbr></wbr></br></br></br>      SOON  <br>Personally another bloody tournament arc is the last thing I'd want to see regardless of whether or not it gets interrupted.
