Carol should have taken advantage of Hibiki while she was KO'd.  <br><br>I bet she's double-jointed with no gag reflex and she fucks like she's being electrocuted</br></br>   Tsubasa lands first to absorb the shock before letting Maria go <br>Neat.</br>  <br>Dat loli butt and dfc. My penis is being compelled to agree.</br>  <br>And summoned the wrath of SENKOU on herself? No she needs to survive as a villian until at least episode 11</br>  <br>No one has to know</br>  <br>Anon no I don't need to think about Kanade deepthroating my dick right now.</br>  <br><br>She'd be stimulating your prostate the whole time too just to make sure she got every last drop out of you she could</br></br>   What are you doing?   <br> one of at least two Biki-POV shots <br>I've never wanted to be a Biki so badly.</br></br>    Will Bikki become a god or have a talk with Odin himself?  <br> You know, gay stuff </br>  <br>More like<br><br> woh! They do that even in public! </br></br></br>    <br>Why are they so gay?</br>  <br>Symphogear has always had bunch of nice animation touches.</br>   no Genjuro <br> mfw </br>  <br>Anyone would be gay for these two so it makes sense they are gay for each other. I wonder if we will ever see how they first met. Were they from the same orphanage?</br>  Chris, Kanade, Maria    <br>They are clearly  brother and sister. Seriously, Kirika still looks like a boy to me. </br>  <br>It's implied</br>  <br> White wedding dress </br>  <br>I'm not gay but I'd let Genjuro enter my butt while watching Enter the Dragon.</br>  <br>Maria and Chris.</br>  <br> being rude </br>  <br>They were Receptor Children so there was probably a long drawn out genealogical survey by Ryoko to find potential replacements for herself, then they were abducted young enough/bought to make suitable experiments without any emotional issues related to being kidnapped and turned into guinea pigs.</br>  <br>All of the characters except for Chris and Maria still need their backstories explained more in depth.</br>    <br>Didn't Shirabe and Kirika basically just spend their entire lives as lab rats? They were picked up so young that they don't really have backstories.</br>    Does Tsubasa have no good parents too?  <br>We only know Tsubasa has Genjuro and a grandpa.</br>  <br>I imagine they were killed by Noise.</br>  Chris is sex<br><br>Seriously she is made to be loved physically, whether its with held hands, fingers locked while making love in the missionary position for the purposes of procreation or tied by the wrists to the headboard, blindfolded ridden hard until she loves it so much she can't live without it</br></br>  <br>A blade is forged, not born.</br>  <br>3deep5me</br>  <br>Ver</br>  <br>I thought the Receptor Children were all taken from orphanages. How long has the Receptor Children program been going on? Did DMJii know Serena?</br>  <br>She's too pure for sex</br>  Who's she going to kill to get Hibiki angry enough to fight?  <br>Kanade because dat voice</br>  <br> Kanade </br>   Oh! Miku! <br><br> You want to get in on this? <br><br> I'll hold her down if you want to have some fun! </br></br></br></br>  <br>But who forged her?</br>  Post table manners.  <br><br>Kay</br></br>  <br>牛乳? More like 巨乳!</br>  <br>Will Chris still be the most unfit one in this season's training montage, or will one of the FIS girls dethrone her?</br>  <br>No one. She'll either prove that pacifism is the best path by not fighting even after someone is killed or learn that pacifism is shit and bad guys need to be punched by going on a journey to find a reason to fight.</br>  <br/>    <br>Chris has to be unfit. Otherwise, you'd have to imagine all that fluffiness replaced by lean, toned muscle.</br>  <br> Those zenbus <br>muh dick</br></br>  <br>WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN</br>  <br>Shirabe will. Maria will surprisingly be fit and spend her time worrying and babying Shirabe.<br><br>For a twist Kirika is last while Shirabe is fit as hell.</br></br></br>  Chris is a whore. A WHORE.  <br>Option A is ludicrous in the face of someone who intends to end the world and option B is going to require an impetus to force her to change her viewpoint. You know, like someone getting killed due to her inaction.</br>  <br>Former whore anon, get it right.</br>  <br><br>Same time this did</br></br>  <br>Hibiki is a ludicrous person and has pulled that shit before. All you have to do is call her a hypocrite once and she'll be a ball of insecurity until she can training montage it away.</br>    <br>lookin mighty chaika there</br>    <br>Will Carol finally be evil instead of being cute?</br>  <br>Hibiki'll sing the second verse of G-beat when option B happens.<br> In order to protect, even if I have to hurt something <br> I won't turn my eyes away from pain anymore <br> Unless I step forward with more resolve <br> I won't be able to face the future </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> We need to save Miku! <br> Go punch some dead cows. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not like they knew where Miku is anyway. Better leave that for the investigation team.</br>  <br><br>That bothers you but drinking three raw eggs in a gulp is fine?</br></br>  <br>Meat. Punch. Get stronger. Fight. Save friends!</br>  <br>She's trying really hard</br>  <br>They're all sexy, except hibiki and shirabe.</br>  <br>Shirabe, hopefully.</br>    <br>I remember you.

Maybe I can be part of her harem.</br>    How come Chris is so sensitive to lewdness  <br>You'd think she'd relate better to Carol than Hibiki</br>  I want to fuck DMJii.  <br>Fine hijacked Ryoko's body 13 years ago.<br>Dunno when did she started to create FIS with America government. But Kirika and Shirabe must know Serena because after FIS found out Serena can use gear without LiNKER, they began to find other candidates. Due to Maria, Shirabe and Kirika have compatiblity, the 3 girls avoided from being killed by FIS.<br>According to S2 keywords it seems like FIS has lots of mad scientist who don't care anything but their own science researches and were gradually out of America government's control.</br></br></br>  <br>see  and </br>  <br>Anime ja nai. Hentai da.</br>  <br>Is it me or Chris zembus seems pretty small on that picture?</br>  <br>Gravitits.</br>  <br>She lost her phonic gain.</br>  Okay seriously who keeps tricking Chris into wearing these things  <br>She's lying on her back anon</br>  <br> standing out that much with that hair and those close <br><br>Begging to be used.</br></br></br>  <br>Tsubasa's breast are bigger than usual in that picture, messing up your sense of scale.</br>  <br>Chris was raised by Fine so we're lucky she wears clothes at all.</br>    I just realized that with Hibiki's daddy issues coming up, we're due for some flashback. Middle school HibiMiku is a given but if they go back far enough, we'll get to see their loli forms.  <br>3 episodes of idol outfits. I actually prefer it to their casual outfits in their website so that's actually a plus.</br>  <br>clothes*</br>  <br>She grew up wearing things like that, she probably thinks it's normal.<br><br>Teenage girls do dress like whores nowadays anyway so she's not even wrong.</br></br></br>  <br>I think they will just give us some flashbacks then threw the whole details to keywords again.</br>  <br>Wasn't she only with Fine for a couple years?<br><br>I think she was primarily raised by South American drug lords.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope we get lots of flashback</br>    <br>I want some DMJii doujins</br>   not choosing the sexiest   <br>We will have a definite answer once I know what Chris' farts smell like.</br>  <br> MID BATTLE SELFIE! </br>    <br><br>A couple of years with Fine is a long time, friend</br></br>  <br>At least 2 years.</br>  <br> We're never going to see a heartwarming post-G DMJii doujin with awkward first-time sex between the two ;_; </br>  <br>But that would imply that haven't already had sex before G even started.</br>  I'm more interested in hibiki's job career in GX. Looks like her grade isn't that great going by the conversation in ep 1.

Since she always says she isn't a hero.</br>  <br>They make the sexiest couple.</br>  <br>W-what makes you think they already did?</br>  <br>Kind of like Subaru.</br>    <br>It sounds like good heartboner material<br><br> HibiMiku have wild, unrestrained sex <br> DMJii is half fumbling and sweet kisses </br></br></br></br>  <br>The shower scene</br>  Hibiki's pantsu  <br> I want Shirabe to have a huge scar on her back from Kirika's scythe to ramp up the awkward and subsequent tenderness </br>    <br> telling them to do things like that at home <br><br>What is wrong with her?</br></br></br>  Tsubasa from behind  in Sympogear :<br>SYMPHOGEEARRR DAA!!!!<br>in G:<br>Gekisou!

It's deploys automatically.</br>  <br>Puffy sword.</br>    <br>She's lying on her back and her tits are actually affected by gravity, now, while Tsubasa is tilting her body forward.</br>  Copypaste from /m/<br><br> Grail War in the symphoverse <br> 2/3 of the servants are all Finé <br><br> And since the masters are magic users &gt;it's probably pretty likely that many of them are Fine too. <br> Hell, the Symphoverse Grail War is basically Fine throwing herself a party. <br><br>Looks pretty fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh sweet jesus, that's absolewdly adorable.</br>  <br>KANADEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EE</wbr></br>  <br>Chris is a pure hearted maiden, degenerate homosexual behavior belongs behind closed doors, not in public and in front of impressionable youths.</br>  <br>She grew up with Fine. So these clothes are most likely Fine hands me down. <br><br> At the sea wearing lingerie </br></br></br>  <br>I thought it could be hers but she was passed the fuck out, ODing on Linker, like always. Not sure why Fine/Shirabe is so special that they are automatically protected even when not transformed.</br>  She was taken from us too soon  <br> No one will ever fix these disgusting pointy knees. </br>  <br>Why do people think Hibiki and Miku are so sex crazed.<br><br>They're both pure and innocent. If they have sex it'll be awkward and cuddly.</br></br></br>  Why don't they just just Swan Song against the alchemists? Easy win.  <br><br>Dammit Chris you do not wear lingerie at the beach</br></br>  <br>Fine could probably cast it regardless of who she was in, even without having to take control. Her never possessing either of them means the topic is going to be a hell of a can of worms no matter how you look at it.</br>  <br><br>Except part of the Symphogear mythos is that it was used by the heroes of old (i.e. servants).<br><br> All masters are just different instances of the same dominatrix queen <br> All servants are Symphogear <br> Literally just Fine hosting a idol battle </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ver's OP LiNKER is gone, meaning the ults are highly dangerous again. Considering Phara shrugged off an entire EX ability, it would be way too much of a risk for something that could potentially be similarly shrugged off.</br>  <br>Does Gungnir detect best girls or does Gungnir make them best girls?</br>  <br> in front of impressionable youths <br>But what if the impressionable youths are the ones being gay?</br></br>  <br>I remember that one thing about Tsubasa teaching Chris that sex can be filled with tenderness and emotions instead of violence and pain.</br>  <br>Wearing lingerie is probably second nature to her, I bet she feels more comfortable in that than an actual swimsuit.</br>  <br>That's a little too intense for me.</br>  <br>Was just curious if anything was confirmed as to why, it's not really important enough to have a full discussion over. It was just another asspull false cliffhanger. Damn season 2.</br>  <br> Fuck, I really want art of that now </br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>They don't know any better.</br>  <br>From what I remember, even the keywords are inconclusive, not to mention all the things that Fine herself mentioned back in S1.</br>  <br>DMJii a best.</br>  <br>Oh, found it in the archives. It was from /m/, in regards to headcanon about their relationship.<br><br>Tsubasa's the one doing the teaching; showing Chris that raw power isn't everything. Taking things slow and steady, savoring each moment, and gently guiding her to the peak and tipping her off it with emotion, not aggression.<br><br>And the followup:<br><br>"See, Yukine? Not everything has to be a competition."<br>"S-Shut up! I only c-c-came because I was bored! You were too slow I almost fell asleep!"<br>"... Two more hours, you say?

We never found out the limitations on her powers when she merely has the option of taking over without actually doing so.</br>  <br>Sadly you're probably right and even if you ever did get to the point where she's somewhat okay with it, you could never be too rough or she might freak out on you.</br>  TAKANARE  G BEAT  MEETA WO GANTO  <br>Their sex will be cute and cuddly but sometimes, Miku turns on her S mode.</br>   5 enemies <br> 6 gears <br>Who will be left out I wonder?<br>Could it be useless?</br></br></br>  Loli Kanade?

They trust each other a lot to know there won't be any unfaithfulness going on  aside from the second OVA .</br>  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/815286/87000e<wbr>37bc/</wbr></br>  <br> Hibiki becomes an abusive drunkard like her dad. <br>This is not okay.</br></br>  <br>GX is going to be <br><br>KISEKI DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br><br>Or some variation of.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Miku and Hibiki invite Chris to bed <br> Chris is left just sitting on the side of the bed, bored, whilst Miku and Hibiki have rough, angry sex </br></br></br>    <br><br>Chris has been healed, thanks to Hibiki, Miku, and Tsubasa.

Also she's 19 now, she probably does get impure thoughts every now and then, even though she is a sword.</br>  <br>Tsubasa's apartment is probably filled with old magazines of  motorcycles , teaching her about all the inner bits of  motorcycle engines , with monthly issues that come with posters of dirty  motorcycles  and little  motorcycle parts so she can build her own model . She probably visits a  motorcycle shop  once every week.</br>  <br>For that matter, ED and OP singles when? I need the full version of Exterminate, and I need it bad.</br>   rewatching G <br> Mikugear appears <br>My body is ready.</br></br>  <br> Slut </br>  <br><br>Mikugear is going to rape you in your sleep.</br></br>  <br>Are you trying to spook me here?</br>  Mikugeah,Chris' song in episode 4 and Chris' transformation were the best things about S2.  <br>Chrisu-chan.</br>  Is anyone else really hyped for Maria's character songs? I really like her voice  and I need more than a song and a half of her actually singing a language Youko can speak  and I'm absolutely adoring the new look of Airgetlam for her from the OP. Or is everyone too preoccupied with 'MARIA IS USELESS' and 'MARIA IS BREEDING MATERIAL' to actually talk about her?  <br>Sometimes we talk about how useless she is. But all jokes aside from what we've seen so far she might actually get shit done this Season.</br>  <br>I'm hyped for the new KORT EL FES GUNGNIR.<br> her CD comes out in september <br>Suffering</br></br></br>  <br>She's my favorite and I look forward to it while being worried as well. Change in gear means change in theme so I think the prideful boast aspect of her old battle song (which I loved) won't come into play. Here's hoping it's a good one.</br>  <br>Maybe she'll become her own character, using her little sister's geah,instead of being known as the most useless gungnir user.</br>  <br>but remember, fine possessing someone is a gradual thing. They don't suddenly turn into fine. It could be possible that one or both were partial possessed.<br><br>On a seperate note, I just watched ep 11 of G where shirabe was capture but given he gear back. She said that Genjuro never changes as if she new him before hand. Genjuro even did a double take as if he thought the same thing. Did we ever figure out what that was about?</br></br></br>  <br>That was Fine speaking through Shirabe.</br>  <br> that feeling when you have a 4chan mascot and the head appears in the transparent part of the image leaving you wondering who that character was in the show for a moment </br>  <br> someone else with Maria as a favorite <br>I thought I was the only one  I actually like Kanade more but I have accepted that she's never coming back so I just call Maria my favorite  There's sure to be a theme change, which is sad, yeah, since Ressou Gungnir is easily in my top 3 songs from G. I'm confident they can't screw up too badly with Youko's voice though.<br><br><br>God damn, as much as I'll go on about liking her as a character, dem fucking hips man. And yeah, I'm really looking forward to seeing Airgetlam in action. It's silly, but that reverse grip chainwhip sword has me hard just thinking about it.<br><br><br>At least it't not as bad as the poor souls waiting for the trio song from ep 1 that doesn't come out until the Bluray.<br><br><br>........... really?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm hyped for the FIS in general, but Airgetlam could be absolutely great and I like what we've seen of Maria so far in GX. There's every chance of her being really good this time around.<br><br><br>It wasn't gradual with Ryoko though - check that flashback again. In order for her to take control of someone, certain conditions need to be met. More importantly, it involves destroying the host's soul, which never happened with Shirabe but happened instantly with Ryoko.<br><br>Similarly, Shirabe seemed to have no idea who she was speaking to when she was in that half-dead state with Fine, which makes me wonder if both her line to Genjuro and her later line to Hibiki are subconscious.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope she has an awesome entrance with her gear. Not just a here's your fixed gear now head out with everyone else and fight, but where everyone else has been defeated and then Maria jumps out of a helicopter out of nowhere and summons her gear and saves the day.</br>  <br>Maria is actually pretty popular, she's one of my favs too. It just so happens that the people who like her also love to bully her. <br>If you see any useless comments then there's a pretty high chance it's by someone who likes her.</br></br>   Episode one airs <br> Captcha now asks for pictures of mountains </br>  <br>Maria is made for bullying because she's usually so serious.</br>  <br>I want this so badly. Maria needs her hero moment so much. I'd be willing to settle for Maria and Hibiki tag-teaming a savior moment, but Maria alone would be the highlight of the season for me.</br>  <br>So just like bullying Salia.</br>  <br>Just you wait. She's gonna go Castlevania on the dolls' asses just when all hope seems lost.  Depending on how she develops this season, I think she might have bestest girl potential. </br>  <br> But all jokes aside from what we've seen so far she might actually get shit done this Season. <br>Yeah, she's off to a nice start. She's still dealing with the "living a lie" issue that she did in G but she's already aware that this isn't what she wants or should be doing and is already going against orders. At least that means she retained the lesson from G so no character regression. She dealt with the gearless thing pretty well considering. <br><br>Living with the blackmail so that Hibiki/DMJii are okay, managed to survive long enough to be saved, focused on civilian safety by running away which turned out to be the correct decision because the enemy pulled out noise from their asses. I did laugh at the Maria Kart thing again. If she manages to console Tsubasa about the gear loss since she's lost her gear twice, that would be swell and a nice development. The battle thing can come later. Chain sword isn't my first choice for her but it has potential.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want Tsubasa to teach her how to fight with a sword.</br>  <br>Reverse grip seems like an especially ineffective way to hold a whip sword. But what do I know.</br>  <br> Castlevania <br> Not Soul Calibur <br>Do you even whip sword?</br></br></br>  <br>I still can't take her seriously after the Embryo thing.</br>  <br>Nothing wrong with Maria, but she never stood out for me. In G she is busy sulking and wondering if what she is doing is right. She'll pretty much never leap into battle under the lie that Fine's soul with take over more, so you don't see her in action too much, which is a shame.<br>Same for her songs, they were alright, but Nana and Ayahi are beyond Godly, it's hard to compare.</br></br>  <br>Maybe it extends and retracts during every swing? That's the only way I could see it not ending terribly.</br>  <br><br><br>I was rewatching the episodes out of order, so I saw the scene where Fine took the disappeared before shirabe (or in this case Fine) made that comment about Genjuro. <br><br><br>I just rewatched it about two weeks ago. My understanding was that while the possession happened instantly under certain circumstances, it was the destruction of the soul that was gradual. If the destruction of the soul was instant, Ryoko wouldn't have came back at the end of S1 because they they still wouldve been the same person. I'll check again though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Taki's superior anyways</br></br>  <br>While I don't have as big a hard-on as most of the Symophogear fans here do, I agree, it's just unfair to compare the rest of the girls' singing voices to Nana and Ayahi.<br><br> I still prefer the deeper singing voices overall though </br></br></br>  <br>I should also check again just to be sure, but that doesn't sound too different from what I had in mind either, so it could be just a few things that we might be interpreting differently.</br>  <br>Based on the way it moved to attack the noise, I don't think the grip factors into it and it just moves based on her will. Chain tornado and drill incoming.</br>  <br>We have yet to see, but I think giving her a whip sword was a pretty smart way to reincorporate her cape moveset. The living cape was just that fantastic.</br>  <br>While whip-sword maria is pretty cool I'm a little disappointed that we will never be able to see Maria fight with her cape again. I thought using a cape as a weapon was extremely cool, but it never really got at screen time except for episode 2 of G</br>  <br> mfw the alchemy-upgraded Airgetlam has a cape, allowing Maria to use both the cape and whip sword together in ultra-twirly combos </br>  <br> chainsaw drillcape <br>ded killy</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I prefer Yoko Hisaka's voice to Nana's voice, it's more sonorous, and it feels mightier. Nana is not a bad singer, but her style isn't my thing, she tends to crack notes a lot, like if you blow into a wind instrument too hard, or something like that (I don't know how that is called in english).</br></br></br></br>  <br> Mfw this, and Mikugear happen <br><br>First time watching symphogear airing and the suspense is killing.</br></br></br>  <br>Tornado and drill are easy to see. She managed to spring jump with the cape which can be done with the sword too although it might look sillier. She can use it like a seeking tentacle like in her fight with Tsubasa. The only hard thing to do would be shielding herself but it's not impossible. Question is if it will look good as a shield.<br><br>I'd laugh if she does Scorpion's GET OVER HERE</br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Absolutely yes.<br><br>Also rewatching the OP again, noticing her off-hand is a Hibiki!Gungnir-like gauntlet. Are we gonna get hotblooded Maria punching things while stabbing them?<br><br> Also the way yellow moves to the beat while dodging Chris' shots is hypnotic <br><br><br> her style isn't my thing <br>I've been searching so long for a way to put into words why I don't like Nana's singing as much as everyone else here seems to, and that's exactly it. She's extremely talented, no questioning that, but I just don't like HOW she sings as much as Ayahi, Aoi, Youko, or  Minami </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no shield <br>RIP paladin mode.</br></br>  <br> Mikugear happen <br>I'm actually expecting Hibiki to lose Gungnir (and get Dainsleif) so Miku can use it. Then all those fanart of Miku using Gungnir can come true.</br></br>  <br> ........... <br>Stop.</br></br>   Maria as a favorite <br>That makes no fucking sense.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, sometimes when she's singing a not she slides it upwards, like in Hajimari no Babel at 0:34. I really don't like that.</br></br>  <br>Some people like failures.</br>  <br> more sonorous <br>This. Although it's hard to not be amused by how bombastic her song was in comparison to her short list of accomplishments last season. I guess this season will be her chance to shine.</br></br>  <br><br>Some people like girls who aren't Mary Sues.</br></br>  <br>She is one of the more serious Geahs though, so that, among other things, can easily attract fans despite her not living up to the early expectations she set in G.</br>  <br>I just hope she doesn't suck up too much screentime.<br><br><br>Oh please.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's true. I also like broken people.</br>  <br>Nice strawman.<br> I was being serious. </br></br>  <br>She's cute, kind and loving, looks great and has a cool voice. Her insecurities only make her more relateable and makes the moments when she's strong willed better.<br>Maria is a pretty high tier character.</br></br>  <br>What about broken dolls?</br>  <br>People like what they like. Whether it;s because of different preferences or relating to different experiences, it's all good.</br>  <br>Red's getting scrapped first, isn't she? Getting built up as cruel and "the strongest" like that is just asking for it.</br>  <br> cool voice <br>FORRIN TUH PEESHES ZA SHADDAH DREEM WARL NASSHINZESHADDASNAW</br></br>  <br>Slide, slide, slide.<br>They better deliver on that Equilibrium scene that they teased.</br></br>  <br>Hibiki will smash her to bits after she stabs Miku.</br>  <br>Judging by the OP she ends up fighting DMJii, who likely won't have functioning Gears until later in the season. I'm guessing Yellow dies first after someone shows up to bail out Chris. While Green is in a similar scenario, she's being set up a bit too much as a mid-boss, and again, if we can go by the OP, Blue is fighting Maria, who likely won't have Airgetlam in working condition for another couple episodes. Yellow could get scrapped as early as next week, but I give her two.<br><br><br>Yeah, I don't think anyone can defend making Youko sing in English. I understand why character-wise they had her do it, but come on. Shame too since they basically robbed her of a song by doing that.<br><br><br>Wow it's really not the same without the music.  Still good though. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Blue will make illusions of Miku.<br>Red will stab Miku.<br>Green will kiss Miku.<br>Yellow will railgun Miku.<br>Carol might do memory alterations with Miku.<br><br>So many possibilities for suffering and berserk rage.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She didn't fail.<br>Due to traumatizing circumstances she ended up on the wrong side of things while trying to do the right thing.<br>Being conflicted about that is absolutely natural. Think about the constellation she was in. There was Mum, who was like a mother and mentor for her and the lolis and who gave them strength. On the other hand there was that batshit insane Ver who they needed to keep Mom alive while he just did as he pleased and betrayed their cause.<br>Now what do?<br>Fight? That would mostly help Ver going on with his shit.<br>Kill Ver? Then Mom would die, also their plans would be thwarted because the lolis need Linker.<br>Defect alone? Then the lolis will be hostages.<br>Defect with the lolis? Then Mom will be a hostage.<br>Also they were probably under the impression they could control Ver if he gets too crazy.<br>Maria has been in a most shitty situation, she had no chance to do the right thing because every possibility had some severe drawbacks.<br>Breaking down and crying was actually the best possible way.<br>Like that she could opt out of fighting for Ver and help him achieve his goals basically sabotaging him. At the same time she could keep Mom alive and hope that the lolis would be so weak without her that they'd get defeated and captured and therefore taken out of Ver's reach.<br>I mean, not that she had all that stuff planned or anything, but in hindsight she did the best thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Breaking down and crying was actually the best possible way. <br>It's also her best skill.</br></br>  <br><br>No, her best skills would be singing, dancing, using her Symphogear and making her hair every morning that it looks like cat ears.</br></br>  <br>Being Miku is suffering.</br>   tfw we have to wait until almost September 30 for Radiant Force   <br>Not him but I consider her as a person who keeps failing because as was said, she's being asked to do things contrary to her nature and wishes. Nothing wrong with calling someone a failure if it's really a facet of their personality. It's not the whole thing though. I won't make excuses nor will I expect her to just suddenly pull a Hibiki and punch through her troubles. She really did keep failing because she had a weak will. <br><br>She's basically a kid who never grew up after her little sister died and it was only after she talked to her sister and had the final talk with her "mother" did she actually manage to do something since she learned to hold hands and all that. Even after she helped save the world, her gear broke and she's back to dealing with hardships again but with a different mindset. If she crumbles again after what she's learned because of a weak will, then yeah I'll go ahead and call her a complete failure but only then. At the same time, I won't deny that she was a failure either since that's an important part too.</br></br></br>  <br>The engrish only adds to her charm.</br>  <br>It does if you assume people who like Maria are brain damaged.</br>  Just watched Season 1. First 4 eps were hype train all through, but it got much weaker after that. The ending would've been more entertaining if not for the fact that a bunch of unexplained shit happened and that the only creativity shown was "same weapons, but 10x larger" and "thing explodes!".

What ones are god-like in your opinion?  <br>I put a puush of the lyrics in the Pastebin on /m/, I'll change it out when there's a more concrete translation.</br>  <br>Listen to all of them.</br>  <br>It's cheating but Hajimari no Uta Babel and Nijiiro no Flügel</br>  <br>But I don't like a few of their voices.</br>  <br>As much as I'm in love with Hibiki 's voice  right now, I'd have to agree. The multi part songs are the best part about Symphogear for me.</br>  <br>You will listen and you will learn to like them, dammit.</br>  <br> inb4 the staff didn't expect to make season 2  <br>Also you just need to understand they were trying to make a 80s anime.</br></br>  <br> suuuuuper </br>  <br>Phonic Gain finds a way.</br>  <br>I'm convinced that Maria is gonna have an awesome fight and then the threads will be filled with Maria worship</br>  Satelight staff implied they had lessons of breakdancing so they can know how to design Leiur's fighting style.  <br>All of Hibiki's songs are pretty god-tier despite Aoi probably being the weakest actual singer. That says something about how much emotion Aoi puts into her songs.</br>  <br>Mika fighting style when? I want to know what that goofy pose is.</br>  How much more songs will Agematsu pump out?  <br>Frog style?</br>  <br>Guess it's better to wait for zoid but it I'll still post the full fixed version here in case he doesn't do it.<br><br>Little Miracle -Grip It Tight-<br><br>There is a purpose in this arm,<br>This device which contains a miracle (There is a purpose)<br><br>My normal everday, my idyllic days<br>For the sake of that dream (sake of that dream)<br><br>I want to convey this warmth (convey this warmth)<br>Not through words (even if not through words)<br>This fist's answer, why I don't carry any weapons<br>A love song containing my [One Hit Sure Love]<br><br>Believe in justice (Believe in justice)<br>Hold it tight (Hold it tight)<br>Even if it gets broken, just do it over again<br><br>It's fine, totally fine (Fine, totally fine)<br>Our hearts echo together<br>The courage not to cry, even [courage] itself<br>Will become a love worth crying over<br><br>I wanted to be entrusted with something...

With that motive<br>I struck with abandon (I struck)<br><br>Always, I've been receiving (Always, I've been receiving)<br>This warm and precious thing (This warm and important thing)<br>It's telling me to not lose, it's telling me to accept it<br>A beloved Love Call burning my chest<br><br>It's not so easy (Not so easy)<br>To break us apart (Break us apart)<br>That's the road I've found<br><br>We hurt and get hurt (hurting each other)<br>Tempered bonds<br>Shine brighter than anything, you know<br>I will stand again...!

This song has a purpose and it's going to hurt.</br>  <br>The way Phara lifts her skirt and flashes us a little of her doll leg has made me start considering things I've never considered before.</br>  <br><br>Yuribait, yurishit, yurifag they will post this shit instead of you / u /</br></br>  <br> that Tsubasa  <br>Pro as fuck.</br></br>  <br>She's been doing it since she was 5. Tsubasa stronkest geah.</br>  <br>Just noticed the female torso mannequin with the display mount going straight into the crotch. Is that how they're always designed?</br>  <br>If Bikki wasn't overpowered by PHONIC GAIN and teached by the master, Tsubasa might be the strongest(second to Genjuuro of course).</br>  <br>Well, Nana's style is really different from everyone else in the whole industry including the actual singing industry in Japan. She has some kind of way that makes her different from others, that's why Nana's unique but yeah, being unique isn't exactly a positive trait. <br>Its understandable why you don't like her as much as I do.</br></br>  <br>Buy a doll.<br>Here is an example.</br></br>  <br>oh boy</br>  So, what do you guys think of Hibiki's songs? <br> http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>10939</wbr> </br>  <br> Second song is heartwrenching.  </br>  <br>I like more the first one  G-BEAT </br>  <br>I feel like Little Miracle is going to kill all of us when we hear it in context.</br>  <br>Chris is the most powerful when it comes to raw power, Hibiki is focused, and Tsubasa has finesse.</br>  G-BEAT? More like G-BEST.  <br>Weirdly enough, the studio version of G-beat is considerably worse than the show version, which itself is worse than Chris and Tsubasa's songs. The whistling just doesn't sound good when added to that song, as much as I love what it's referencing.<br><br>As for Little Miracle, the other 2 described it just about perfectly.</br></br></br>  <br>Chris is DPS, Hibiki is explosive burst, Tsubasa is crits.  JUGGERNAUUUUUUT </br>  <br>Now I want to see them play an MMO.</br>  <br>Yes. Even though those look more like mannequins for sewing</br>  <br>Why is the glow behind chris pink instead of red</br>  <br>I want to see them play Dark Souls<br> Tsubasa is a tryhard katana dexfag <br> Hibiki uses fun weapons like Bone Fist and yolos everything <br> Chris has no clue what to do and dies to everything </br></br></br></br>  <br>Because red is too distracting to put on the background.</br>  <br> yolos </br>  <br> It makes me want to go play WoW. But I know if I do, I'll just be disappointed because WoW has been shit for many years now. </br>  <br>But yellow, blue and pink aren't? How does that follow?</br>  <br><br>Too deep in the uncanny valley.</br></br>  <br>I've been up too long and couldn't think of a better term in 10 seconds. Will this Chris make up for it?</br>  <br>Yes, red is a full blown "LOOK HERE" color.<br>Pink less so.</br></br>  <br> Will this Chris make up for it? <br> Almost. Bikki is best for me, but I'll accept your apology. </br></br>  Will Ver make his return?  Does anyone else think the new villains are 2hus?  <br>Break Through the Limit, G-Beat<br><br>The determination to break through a single point in my right hand, is in this echoing sound called me<br>Before asking [How?

I had a dream this morning where I was playing paintball with Nana and Sugita and she said she was looking into dark european mythology/fantasy stuff because of Symphogear and I told her to play Witcher 3.   <br>I can't get over that distorted "daijobou" in Little Miracle.<br><br>It's going to fucking hurt.</br></br></br>  <br> that strain after Love echoes, it echoes strongly, as strong as our grips, as strong as our connection <br><br>HEART<br>BREAKING</br></br></br></br>  <br> daijoubu <br> heiki hechalla <br> Aoi practically crying in the last part just in the studio version <br>it's gonna be brutal</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish I had dreams where I play fun games with Sugita and Nana too.<br> Did you feed the Nana her beloved curry, anon? </br></br>  <br>There's so much going on in the song it's guaranteed to be brutal.<br><br> I want a scene where she sings it while crying after something horrible happens to her, then she stands up and sings the last 4 lines. </br></br></br>  <br>I'm not ready for whatever Kaneko is going to throw at us.<br>Maybe I should start looking for the purpose of my life now.</br></br>  <br> No, she did bring me fruits though. It was like an reenactment of the Tokyo Encounter episode </br>  Does anyone have the deus vult version of ma'am wills it?  <br> not feeding Nana her favorite curry <br>One job anon.<br>Well, at least she gave you fruits.<br>Let me guess : its fucking oranges/tangerines.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tsubasa and Yukine are the cutest and the sexiest.</br>  <br> TE Nana episode <br>Subs never.<br> ;_; </br></br></br>  <br> It was a honey melon. I have no idea why. </br>  <br>This guy gets it.<br>Hibiki is perfection too.<br>Gear trio is perfection.</br></br></br>    <br> leaving out Bikki <br><br>rude.</br></br></br>  <br>   honey melon <br>What<br>Why<br>Do you like those or something?</br></br></br></br>  <br> I had some a few days ago, maybe that's the reason. Dreams are fucking weird. </br>  <br>I like you. May Nana bless you.<br>You should've included Hibiki too though.</br></br>  <br>MIKU</br>  <br>definitely</br>  <br>Flustered sword is best sword.<br>Thank you Maria for reviving Tsubasa's inner shyness.</br></br>  <br>Who else would be behind gear-destroying red-mist not-noise?</br>  <br><br>Are there gyategyates of the other girls?</br></br>  <br>gee i dunno boss<br><br>maybe a character from THIS season</br></br></br>  <br>You're using your shift key in all the wrong places.</br>  <br>But Fine made an appearance in S2.</br>  <br>Hardly.</br>  Tsubasa is flat and does nothing after S1. She has brain damage, believes she's a sword, and can't clean her own room.<br>Chris is used goods, and eats like a disgusting toddler. She probably shits herself sometimes.<br>Hibiki can't sing for shit. She deserved to be bullied for killing Tsubasa's mentor by being a fucking retard standing around for no reason.<br>Maria is a boring angsty murderer, not to mention useless. She should have stayed in prison.<br>Kirika is an edgy little shit who is fucking retarded. She randomly shouts DESS for absolutely no god damned reason.<br>Shirabe is kinda short I guess. She probably smells.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tsubasa is flat <br>B81!</br></br>  <br>Hibiki is one lucky girl</br>  <br>Shirable smells like pink damn you!</br>  <br> Hibiki deserved to bullied <br><br>OVER THE LINE</br></br></br>  <br>bulge shop when</br>  <br> Hibiki can't sing for shit. <br> She deserved to be bullied <br> being a fucking retard <br><br>Goddamn anon you sure know how to piss people off.</br></br></br></br></br>    People hate on Maria for killing 5 soldiers but Miku blew up an entire ship.  <br> not knowing your ancient memes </br>  <br>She was being mind controlled.</br>  <br>Those soldiers were firing on civilians and Ver's Noise had already killed everyone on that ship.</br>  I've been sitting here trying to put into words why I like Miku so much for a while but I can't quite get it out.<br><br>Power is sexy, and she has the strongest will of any of them. She has a great figure, but she doesn't have the ridiculous proportions of a Maria/Chris. She's unassuming and is in the background in most cases, but she is perfectly capable of taking the spotlight when necessary.<br><br>There's a gap between her natural cuteness and the scary things that lurk behind it, as we saw with Mikugeah. I imagine her as a sadist, and no matter the situation in bed, she has control.<br><br>Basically she's who I want to self-insert as.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tsubasa  <br> does nothing after S1 <br>Were you asleep when you watched G or something? She has less screentime, yes, but she also fought.<br> Bikki <br> killing Tsubasa's mentor <br>Kanade isn't her motherfucking mentor, for God's sake, she's Tsubasa's friend.<br>5/10 bait, well done, you fucking made me reply</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  She is just oh so scary and oh so sexy.  <br> Kanade isn't her mentor <br>Anon please.<br> mentor and friend are mutually exclusive <br>Anon please.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean she was romancing her mentor? That's haram.</br>  <br>With all the (not) breaking apart bond, hurting, and redoing things, it makes me fear that memories lost will really be a thing.</br>  <br>Fuck, I forgot that memories were going to be a plot point.  I'm scared. </br>  <br>So what I'm getting from this is that Miku is the best girl?</br>  <br>It took me awhile to accept that Tsubasa got over Kanade's death over the spam of a couple episodes. Commander is a bro though.</br>  <br>Nothing can stop Alphalord Tsubasa if she's powered by Nana's will.</br>  <br>Tsubasa is clearly not so alpha around older women.</br>  <br>Well, at least it seduces bitches of all ages.<br>Just like how Nana manages to attract 60 year old women for some weird reason.</br></br>  <br>I don't think she gets over Kanade's death that quickly. She obviously let it bother her for the whole time between Kanade dying and Bikkie showing up, and up through ep. 12 in S1 she keeps hearing Kanade's voice and seeing visions of Kanade.</br>  <br>she's also top wife material.</br>    <br> Nana manages to attract 60 year old women for some weird reason. <br>please tell me this is real.</br></br>  still otp  <br>I miss meek Tsubasa.</br>   Shhhhh... just lie back and let it happen   <br>It's been 4 years. Tsubasa moved on already. Why can't you?</br>  <br><br> Tsubasa moved on already. <br><br>To who?</br></br></br></br>  <br>WHY? why did she have to die?<br>would the show have been better if Kanade was still alive?</br></br>  <br>It is.<br>Nana has a fan club in her hometown filled with old hags and old men that watch Nana BDs and root for her whenever she has lives.  Which is founded and led by her own mother. </br></br>    <br><br>Hibiki, you should be training to fight 2hus instead of posting on American imageboards</br></br>  <br><br>Watch Kanade come back as a doll this season to reclaim her waifu from this thieving cat</br></br>    <br>I can't wait until episode 7 to see how hard Tsubasa will french kiss Kanade once she sees her back.</br>  captcha knows  I can't stop listening to Little Miracle.  Is Hibiki still the most baka?  Madoka Thread.<br><br>Also, thought I'd ask: Has Rebellion been given the Meduka Meguca treatment yet? And if so, why can I not find it?</br></br>  I miss kevin and his autism  Did nothing wrong    No Idea why these always turn into Homu threads, but damned if I don't enjoy it.  <br>2 homu threads today. She is the best girl afterall. and my homu folder can never have to much homu.</br>  <br>Where did he go?</br>  <br>no idea, maybe he has to sleep early like apple. or maybe he died trying to be a vigilante dressed as sayaka. Either way if he sees this thread, expect a sayaka derail.</br>  <br>This makes me really sad.</br>  <br> k-kevin kun, i-i didnt think you would be home so early..</br>  <br>It was just so sad that I had to comment on it.,</br>  <br>with iwata being kill that is the highlight of my day.. Thankfully i have not yet fallen into despair...</br>  <br>I'm glad! It's bad to despair! Poor Nintendo, but despite that, you must solider on!</br>  <br>maybe blue and black do go well together...</br>  <br>As well as oil and water.</br>  <br>Rest his soul.<br><br><br>We don't need any of this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I question how Madoka would react to such a thing</br>  <br> Madoka Thread </br>  <br>It's like two levels of ntr</br>  <br>no sayaka and homu would only be friends! Of course homu's one and only love is madoka!</br>  <br>Please post more.</br>  <br>How about no.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128013678 <br>Generic substanceless [sic] remark.</br>    <br>Nice.</br>  <br><br>Cease this and quit replying to yourself.</br></br>  <br>Meduka Meguca was funny because it used screenshots of the goofy looking off-model characters in the original TV release. Rebellion is movie-quality so there isn't much off-model to make fun of.</br>  <br>Wat? Go to sleep madoka. Homu will be back in the morning.</br>      <br>New thread topic. Who is widest magica?</br>  <br>Mami.</br>  So I finally watched Rebellion almost 2 years after everyone else did I have no idea what even happened in the 2 hours I spent watching it. I sort of understand that Homura became a witch because she wanted to see Madoka again, but then she literally rips her from her Goddess status and in doing so transforms into the devil. Can someone explain to me in detail what the hell happened?  <br>I think the green fiend may be the widest</br>  I CAN'T WAIT TO TAKE MADOKA BACK TO HELL  <br>Homura raped Kyubey</br>  <br> that file name <br>AI YO happened.</br></br>    <br>Y'know how at the end of the series Madoka became a god?<br><br>Yeah, Homura felt really lonely about that, and because of Kyubey being a dick and cutting her off from the Law of Cycles, witched out. Shit happend, Homura tried to die, our heroes didn't let it happen because that's what friends do, and then everything went well, yeah?<br><br>Except remember that scene in the flower field, when Homura and Madoka talked about Homura's "Dream"? Well, THAT made Homura think that Madoka was unhappy being god. And so she decided to force her to stop so she could be happy, whether she wanted to or not.<br><br>And now Homura is a Demon and we will eventually be getting another sequel. And it was good.<br><br>Also Kyubey got mind raped hardcore. And it EVERYONE LOVED IT.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Homura went back to her Madoka dependence to the point of being a crazy stalker and fucked up the universe turning it into a world no one but her crazy stalker self ever wanted, through an ability that had zero explanation or foreshadowing. Because fuck you, we need a setup for another TV season and we're too lazy to think of new characters.</br></br>  <br>Oh boy.</br>    <br> and everyone loved it </br>  <br>Homu was now in a world where only she remembered madoka. This caused her to fall into dispair as she thought her memories were false and that she was going crazy. Not having concrete proof that the thing you suffered for evet even existed hurt her alot. Which is why she said " even pain is precious " during rebellion after going full witch and then finally breaking free from qb. Her mental state was at its limit. So whe She saw a chance to change everything she took it. Although it may have not been the outcome the other magicas or godoka would have wanted homu took it apon herself to create a new world where all her hardships would finally off. rather than simply going with madoka and leaveing qb to attempt something like he did again, she forcefully changed the rules. In this new world all magicas are alive again. Madoka is safe. Qb is is now not a threat. And the LoC is still intact. Homuhomu is actually the only one that didnt get a good ending, something she is okay with as long as madoka remains happy. Also homu is best girl</br>  <br> In this new world all magicas are alive again. Madoka is safe. <br> Homuhomu is actually the only one that didnt get a good ending, something she is okay with as long as madoka remains happy. <br><br>I need to remember that mind rape is the best way to safety and happiness.<br><br> And the LoC is still intact. <br><br>Fanfiction.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He'll be fine.</br>    <br>Why don't they bring back more dead mahou shoujos?</br>  <br>No one loves Nagisa or Sayaka as much as Homura loves Madoka.</br>  <br>Oi, the LoC isn't instinct.<br>Homura just took Madoka from it.</br></br>  <br> Except remember that scene in the flower field, when Homura and Madoka talked about Homura's "Dream"? Well, THAT made Homura think that Madoka was unhappy being god. <br><br>Which is the point where Homura went fully delusional, considering that she already knew for a fact that everyone's memories and personality traits were tampered with and changed - according to her own subsonscious wishes - within the dreamworld she currently resided.</br></br></br>  <br>It's okay if that's what you think homu hater. I will always make a exception for you and so will homu!</br>  <br> " i just took a small part of it"  <br><br>Listen closely to what homu said at the end, she only took the part of the loc that was regular school girl madoka.</br></br></br>  <br> Why don't they bring back more dead mahou shoujos? <br><br>Nobody cares either in or out of the universe. In-universe Homura certainly won't give a single fuck about people besides those she defines as Madoka's "supporting cast".</br></br></br>  <br>I know that.<br>Unless you're referring to the 50% off thing.<br>Where as Madokami and Madoka are now separate entities</br></br></br>  <br>All things considered, I understand where Homura was coming from on this one.<br><br>Like, she's gone through, what, 100 month long time loops just so save her friend, only to see her die/witch the fuck out every time? And then the one time where shit goes relatively well, THEN Kyubey decides to fuck around, leading to Madoka telling her "Hey. Sacrificing myself to save everyone doesn't really sound like something I'd want to do."<br><br>That was the point where Homura came to the conclusion that, once again, She fucked it up, and this time, she couldn't do jack shit about it. It's only natural that she snapped and went to incredibly extreme measures in order to keep Madoka safe and happy, regardless of the costs to herself.<br><br><br>I don't think Homura CAN bring them back, considering she doesn't really know them. Madoka doesn't have that problem, since her wish lets her know all the Magical Girls once she takes their souls.<br><br>Besides, I'm pretty sure it was implied to have been a volunteer job anyway, since Sayaka and Nagisa had a reason to come back.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Homura won. The aliens are defeated, Madoka is now her pet, and the other girls are her (much happier) subjects. It's love, I ain't gotta explain shit.</br>  <br>She still refered to the loc in a way that its origonal purpose still functions. If she had killed the loc completely, akuma would definitely not have explained it to sayaka the way she did. Seeing how blunt she was, homu would have just told sayaka lel sorry but the loc is kill. That being said until a sequel is made, no one knows the exact conditions of tis new universe</br>  <br> Mami drunk on tea </br>  <br>Thanks to her epic win all the magicas won too.<br> Qb got rekt<br>mami wind a cheesy loli<br>sayaka's origonal wish is still intact <br>kyoko has sayaka now<br>Madoka can be woth her family.<br><br>Homu just has to run this world aline now. But being the best, she will do it and ask nothing in return other than madoka's happiness. She will also accept any punishment, but as long as mado is happy she will be happy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm going to start Mamiposting<br>Theres already too much homu in here</br>  <br> That was the point where Homura came to the conclusion that, once again, She fucked it up, and this time, she couldn't do jack shit about it. <br><br>If that was the truth she would have turned into a witch IMMEDIATELY after being dropped out of Madokami's dimension in Ep.12. Epilogue, where she understands Madoka's intentions and wishes and decides to live honoring them woudn't have been possible.<br><br> It's only natural that she snapped and went to incredibly extreme measures in order to keep Madoka safe and happy, regardless of the costs to herself. <br><br>"Costs to herself" are besides the point, though I wouldn't call "becoming a nigh-omnipotent being that can do whatever the fuck she wants" a "cost". She imagined that Madoka is unhappy, counter to Madoka's own words, because SHE was unhappy without Madoka, and decided to enforce her version of happiness on Madoka, by stripping away memories, character development, everything that did not fit her image of Madoka and trapping her in a comfortable cage. People kept under tight guard with electrodes constantly stimulating pleasure centers in their brain can be called "safe and happy" too, but I doubt that anyone would want this sort of safety and happiness for oneself. Even Homura herself understands, deep down, that it is not at all about Madoka, it is about Homura, that's why she calls herself the devil. <br><br>In short, Homura is the character that was assassinated the hardest in the Rebellion, though Sayaka and Kyubey are not far behind.

I dont get it</br></br>  <br>ebin here</br>  There's surprisingly way more good fujoshi characters than I remember.  <br>From what I've gathered over the years is that anti-yuri posters tend to be male faggots rather than fujoshis, at least here on /a/.</br>  So the latest chapter was interesting to say the least.<br><br>Keith explained a few gray areas but also created a new one, what the hell was Eren's Dad doing on the outside of the walls? Where did he come from? Was he from a human comunity outside the walls more advanced then the inside of the walls? He seemed to have had more advanced medical knowledge.</br></br>  He lived in a community that coexists with the titans. He stole some titan serum, ate a shifter, and then ran as fast as his ass could run. Once he arrived at the walls he was found by the SL and brought inside the walls. MT, knowing that Grisha probably made it inside the walls, released a plague on the inhabitants (the same plague that turned Connie's village into titans). Grisha, being a doctor that specializes in studying titans, cured the city and won the Carla bowl.  <br>BRA are from areas that have been subjugated by MT, who is carrying out the will of the First King. They were forced to go to the walls and attempt to locate Grisha, with the permission to destroy all life within the walls to do so if they must. Once they discovered that Eren had eaten him they tried to instead bring Eren back so they no longer had to kill anyone.</br>  <br>Probably related to MT and BRA. He originally invaded as a spy but he grew attached to humanity, enough to marry a human and support humanity. He obviously lied about being too drunk, he had his memories from the start.</br>  <br>Hange was a real cunt this chapter</br>  <br>Or he was a doctor 100 years prior and was one of the first titans to be created and he wondered around like Yimir until he happens to eat a shifter and turn back into a human.<br><br>Hell he could be one of the original scientists working with the first king who created the titans.</br></br></br>  <br>The First King created titans as a means of warfare, with the goal of destroying all of humanity except for his own society, where there would be no conflict. MT is one of the warriors that he set out to accomplish that. There are other villages outside the walls, but they have all been subjugated by MT and his forces. The walls are comprised of his subjects that he gave the Colossal Titan serum to, and willed them into hardening themselves. They aren't shifters, so they can't be exposed to sunlight, lest they start destroying things.<br><br><br>That's possible too. However, I don't think it's that easy to come across shifters to eat. Ymir got lucky in that she was one of the first titans to enter the walls after Bert kicked the gate in. Then she found BRA's friend and ate him. Ymir didn't have the shifter power until the walls were under attack and only got it because MT sent a bunch of kids to do his dirty work and infiltrate the SL if necessary.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She wanted answers and all she got was a guy crying about how useless he is and how he got cucked.</br>  <br>Grisha and monkey trouble are half brothers or some shit.</br>  <br>who would've thought keith was an ultimate cuck.<br><br>First by Grisha then by Erwin</br></br></br>  <br>He also probably felt feels when he saw Eren at training, he did say he looks just like Carla.</br>  <br>That's gotta be weird, seeing a 15 year old boy that looks exactly like you're waifu.</br>  <br>I just said feels I didn't specify what kind of feels.</br>  I wonder if Carla knew about Grisha's basement experiments.  <br><br> incoming eren rape doujin by the trainer </br></br>   This child isn't like you <br>OUCH</br>  /a/, I just wanted to let you know that you are already great...<br><br>Because you were born...<br><br>Into this world.</br></br></br></br>  Who's BRA and MT?  <br>MT = Monkey Trouble<br>I forget BRA<br><br><br>Was this the mangaka's way of letting us know Eren will never get more development?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>BRA - Bert Reiner Annie<br>MT - Monkey Trouble</br></br>  <br>typical shonen mom trump to make all the virgin reading feel special.</br>  <br> Was this the mangaka's way of letting us know Eren will never get more development? <br><br>Or maybe that he's special because he isn't special? Unlike manlet, Mikasa and Historia who are all special snowflakes.</br></br></br>  <br> chief kieth: EREN PUT ON THIS WIG! <br> eren: D-DAME DESU SENSEI </br></br>  <br>How is Eren not the biggest special snowflake? He's a shifter and the coordinate at that.</br>  <br>He's written like the chosen one, but other characters try to force that he's not. Eren is the biggest one out of all, even Isayama said he wasn't flawed enough.</br>  <br>Why Grisha stole the Coordinate? Why he chose to die?</br>  <br>I know, I was saying he's the biggest special snowflake too.</br>  <br>Carla looks really hot.</br>  <br> Carla's mom <br> Literally Eren with long hair <br><br>Absolutely disgusting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>MT is Grisha's senpai and he just wanted to be noticed.</br>  this manga reminds me of that show Lost<br>and Lost became  shit </br>  <br>I know right?</br>  <br>Maybe She admired his and was dissapinted he retired, and now she heard his shitty excuse she got mad.</br>  <br> And you Mister. You shouldn't let people sweet-talk you like that, you know <br><br>Was Carla alpha?</br></br></br>  <br>Anon, there are some threads in this board where you can lurk desperately and make countless post, and yet gain nothing,</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128004956 <br> Saved. <br>You mean my webM right?<br><br> tfw someone finally notices how cute as fuck my webM is </br></br></br></br>    <br>Eren looks cute in that barmaid dress.</br>  <br>Carla was the manliest Jeager in the manga.</br>  <br>I don't get it why he decided to die? He was leaving the key to save humanity with a kid. That's too much faith in the next generation.</br>  <br>Alpha women aren't manly they' are just sexy as fuck.</br>  <br>Because he genetically modified Eren to be able to use the powers of the First King. The basement is filled with the corpses of failed clones.</br>  <br>Because Grisha is Eren. Plot twist</br>  <br>I want her to dominated me.</br>  So BR chapter next month?  <br>kek u gay</br>  <br>Jesus Christ how horrifying</br>  <br>mmm Carla femdom would be sooooo hot</br>  <br>The resemblance is uncanny.<br><br>Disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't mean it in a bad way or in a "she's a man" kind of way, Carla was the Alpha Jeager and that's arousing.</br>  <br>Keith did say that he looks like her. Cue<br/></br>  <br> that's arousing <br>Please don't tell me you text those babes on tinder "that's arousing"<br><br>Don't say that shit again.</br></br></br></br>    Would Mikasa a Carla? Would Grisha a Eren?  <br>nah, Mikasa abandoned the fuck outta Carla</br>    <br> He stole some titan serum, ate a shifter, and then ran as fast as his ass could run. <br>He might've been a titan shifter already and he probably made the serums himself seeing how he knows so much about the human body to be a doctor. <br>I'm wondering why his clothes were messed up when he met Keith. He got messed up before he shifted or after somehow.<br><br> MT, knowing that Grisha probably made it inside the walls, released a plague on the inhabitants (the same plague that turned Connie's village into titans). <br>Grisha's smart af so if he was running from MT, I think he would've chose which outer district to be found nearby and taken in. <br>Those plagues are pretty different. The one that hit Connie's village looked instantaneous while the Shigansina one killed people slowly. <br>The plague that hit Connie's village looked instantaneous because they all came out in separate areas where if it was slow, they'd all go to a hospital nearby altogether like how everyone came to Grisha in Shigansina. I also doubt Grisha was able to save everyone before they died from that plague too and if it really was the same plague that MT used on Connie's village, they should've seen some titans too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Granny Historia.</br>  <br>SnK: Peaceful Rural Life edition</br>  <br> Would Mikasa a Carla?  <br>Mikasa is erensexual, it doesn't matter if there is anyone that looks exactly like him she'll still be hopelessly pining for her husbando<br><br> Would Grisha a Eren? <br>Pretty creepy to fuck your kid</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this real? It looks so badly drawn even for Isayama.</br>  <br>why is Armin jacking himself off???</br>  <br>Why is Eren squeezing Armin's ass?</br>  <br>He is thinking about when he lost his virginity</br>  <br>His hands are in his pockets, fag.</br>  <br> fag <br> implying EAr is homo </br></br>  <br> They were forced to go to the walls and attempt to locate Grisha, with the permission to destroy all life within the walls to do so if they must. <br>iirc, one of their main objectives was to kill all of humanity which is not the will of the First King. read that chapter when Bert and Reiner are chatting when they have captured Eren and Ymir.<br><br>Also if capturing Grisha their main objective, I think they would've taken Eren after hearing his last name and that he was from the same district they attacked.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Look's like Isayama's art, though there are a lot of good imitation artists.</br>  <br>I suppose it is real since Editor-kun posted it.</br>  <br>Would Ymir a Armin? </br>  Two theories.      <br>End of theory one.</br>    <br>End of theory two</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128010024 <br>It's Team Manlet minus manlet.

Special people have a hard time understanding normals.</br></br></br>  <br>Tranny is 2edgy4me.</br>  <br>The MP were after him I think. There was nowhere else for him to go.</br>  <br>Heh. Back when I was just getting into the series my original theory regarding the Colossal Titan was that 60 meters titans were the normal out in the rest of the world and the 15 meter ones scratching at the wall were the small titans. <br>I still sort of hope that's true.</br></br>  Is Mr. Hansi man or woman?  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Why not both?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128011418 <br><br>Please go back to tumblr.</br></br>  <br>There's a full theory in the book about how Titans in the North would be bigger. It uses the migration patterns of bears as an example. <br><br>I thought the implications of BRA's village getting attacked was more interesting though.</br></br></br>  <br>In the official translation someone responded to her with a "Yes, sir".</br>  <br>There was something about Isayama asking them to switch between male and female pronouns. <br>I still think he was just butthurt that someone even asked about it in the first place.</br></br>  <br>If he doesn't like a question he'll just give a bullshit answer to fuck with the idiots. Reminder that it's okay to read Armin as a girl if you want to.</br>  <br>Didn't he ask them to use neutral pronouns?</br>  <br>I guess he never studied English because that isn't really possible.</br>  Even if you're countershitposting don't reply goddamn  <br>So this means that CT can explode at will then?</br>  <br> I still think he was just butthurt that someone even asked about it in the first place <br>He was cool with the questions about Nanabs sex he said she's 100% female. hanji was meant to be a shemale since the beginning.</br></br>  <br>Isayama went to America for school.

Hajime Isayama (Attack on Titan; 234 points) </br></wbr></wbr></wbr>  <br>It's possible but it just sounds like you are talking about an object rather than a person.</br>  <br> who is carrying out the will of the First King. <br>?</br></br>  <br>Only if you're talking about a hypothetical situation or if you don't know whether someone is male or female. Like if you're talking about solving a crime and you refer to the criminal as "he". If you know the gender of the person it can no longer be used in a neutral way. The only way you could get around saying "he" or "she" is if you just refer to them by their name every time which will sound awkward when done constantly.</br>  <br>Because he doesn't like her?</br>  <br> The First King created titans as a means of warfare, with the goal of destroying all of humanity except for his own society <br>There is nothing implying this, only that he was a coordinate who runned wild.</br></br>  <br>She's a  wesome. </br>  <br>I wonder if his time in America is where he got the idea for 3dpd Shotawin.</br>  <br>He got it from a music video.</br>  <br>That guy doesn't fully look like Erwin to me.</br>  <br>That's what Isayama said though.</br>  So do we have a status chart for ch 71?  <br>Keith is a cuck<br><br>Eren is still annoying <br><br>Hanji is a little insensitive in this chapter</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Eren wasn't annoying at all.</br>  <br>Yeah, let's be honest.

I saw someone write the answers although they seemed more like jokes.  Is this Mikasas jealous face?  <br>Here: <br>Q: Does Erwin use gel or pomade?<br>A: He uses hair styling products. He's particular about it.<br>Q: Were Eren and Armin not with their other batchmates a lot?<br>A: There was once a rumor going around that the two of them were too close.<br>Q: Is the emblem on the soldiers' uniforms embroidered? Or printed?<br>A: Embroidered.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying Mikasa feels emotion as we do. </br>  <br>That's her cuck face.</br>  <br>Historia is a midget</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128016589 <br>are you ok? do you need a sit down?</br>  <br>So if eren was in trouble Mikada wouldn't save him because she feels no emotion?</br>  <br>hawt</br>  <br>She's programmed to protect him by Grisha.</br>  <br>Why does it look like Armin is grabbing his unsheathed cock on that cover?</br>  <br>Because Eren is grabbing his ass.</br>  <br>no she feels emotion, just not the same way we do, she's some kind of Eren dick seeking robot.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128016589 <br>Too much</br>  <br>So what would she do if Eren was having sex with historia and she caught them?</br>  <br>She knows what's happening and she knows there's nothing she can do to stop it.

Altough Jean picking Eren's side is the only surprise here. </br>  <br>We need some thought bubbles for this.<br>Volunteers?</br></br>  Why are Isayama's covers aways so comfy?  <br>Comfy, right.</br>  <br>To give us a false sense of security and warmth, only for us to open up the volume and see our dreams and hopes obliterated harder and faster than Carla Jaeger's pussy.</br>  <br>I wish we got more of Eren fighting as a titan with support from normal soldiers</br>  <br>Dat ass is comfy to me.</br>  <br>Eren with Levi and his squad would've put Annie in the fucking dumpster</br>  <br>Unlikely.</br>  <br>Then Bert and Reiner would've saved her</br>  <br>Though I think the cover actually represents the characters' outlooks on their future/goals.

Smug ass little cunt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Armin's finally gonna get his hands on that unreleased BDSM porn of Mikasa with Eren using her scarf to spank, choke, and gag her?</br>  <br>Yes, and her name's Annie.</br>  <br>Annie is coming out of the crystal to give him a booty call.</br>  <br><br><br>Two types of people...</br></br></br>  <br>he's going to rape Annie in every way he's dreamt of since the lies he told Berf<br>then he's going to get the titan serum and only eat a piece of her spine. <br><br>This is all his plan to have every strategic advantage against his enemies and<br>this is by no means all just his dark desires.</br></br></br></br></br>  This is obviously what the new cover is trying to tell us:<br> Jean is sad because he will never score <br> Historia gave Armin a BJ and that's why he's covering his penis while smiling and why Historia is facing him  <br> Mikasa finally raped Eren hence her smug look and his sadness <br> Sasha and Connie fucked too </br></br></br></br>  <br>Then Keith will fall in love only to be cucked by a friend again</br>    Do you think we'll ever find out what Sasha was up to while the others were dealing with Reiner and Bert's shit?  <br>Selling her body for food probably</br>  <br>I hope Armin dies.</br>  <br>Wasn't she busy saving her village from titans? I don't remember her coming up the wall with the rest of them, which was when Eren got kidnapped.</br>    <br> wanting best 104 boy to die </br>  <br>Armin's too smart to die</br>  <br>One of my favorite fanarts.</br>  <br>Armin is the worst.</br>  <br>Eren got kidnapped the day after she'd saved her village.</br>  <br>She saved her village, then at nightfall that was when Utgard happened, right? And then the next day was the kidnapping. Maybe she was with her village the whole time. She hadn't seen her father in a long time and was probably catching up.</br>  Why didnt bort help reiner out in the fight with monkey troubles?<br>He's not THAT useless, is he?</br>  <br>Bert is more useful than Reiner will ever be.</br>  <br>Reiner, pls</br>  <br>It looks like they made a deal, not an outright fight.</br>  <br>That's the limited edition cover. The actual cover will still be released.</br>  <br>Sure thing</br>    <br>Reiner is not only retarded but he has a crippling mental illness that hinders their mission.</br>  <br>The first one is impossible now that Keith's identity is confirmed.</br>  <br> being strong as fuck <br> mental illness <br><br>Anon what the hell?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you as retarded as Reiner or what?</br>  <br>He is that useless. But that's what makes him cute.</br>  <br>The third and fourth titan are from Rakugo village. The fifth titan is from Ymir's faction. The first one is obviously Keith. I'm not sure what the person who made this was trying to make a point of beside a vague similarity that means nothing. Also I think it's impossible to create a titan out of a dead person.</br>    <br>I hope hanji rediscovers all the lost science magic and uses it to become a real girl</br>  The only good thing about the last chapter was that Sasha is still traumatized about the potato incidents.  <br>Because Bertholdt's titan form only serve the purpose of destroying the Wall. He's not build for fighting.</br>  <br>He's over twice the size though</br>  <br>Will she kill herself when Eren and Historia start fucking?</br>  <br>how many times did Keith cream her on that table?</br>  <br>Woah anon it's not about the size.<br><br>Its about the motion of the ocean.<br>FUCK i'm so fucking alpha.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope so</br>  Historia falling for Eren is her biggest deathflag. It was foreshadowed at the beginning of the mango that Mikasa would bear children, and there's no way she's gonna bear anyone but Eren's children, making Historia lose by default.  <br>The titan is too big and takes too much "energy"' to make him move, at most fight.</br>  <br>He's too slow to fight.</br>  <br> It was foreshadowed at the beginning of the mango that Mikasa would bear children <br>Eh? If that was Mikasa's daughter, she wasn't calling Eren dad.  It most likely was Frieda. </br></br>  <br>I'm talking about pic related</br>  <br>That's a if, anon. Mikasa wasn't in the survey corps.</br>  <br>Is EH a meme now or do people seriously believe Historia likes Eren.</br>  <br>this isn't canon any more</br>  <br> if <br> when you have children of your own <br> when <br>Stay delusional EHfag</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just read chapter 70 and it's pretty clear they spent some time together during those two months anon.</br>  <br> there's no way she's gonna bear anyone but Eren's children <br>Naw. She'll just get raped by Keith once she says he can't have Eren.</br></br>  <br>It's not a meme, Historia likes him but she's gonna die.</br>  Where did you guys read the latest chapter? I usually only go here when it's out but I must have missed it.   draw Erin with long hair <br> call it a girl <br><br>Stop this</br></br></br>  <br>Ymir please.</br>  <br><br>Theory one makes a lot of sense. At this point there seems to be 3 clear factions in the story, no more no less. BRA would be the Germanic tribe and the Huns seem to be the Yaeger/Jaeger faction.<br><br>Some clues to that: Yaeger titan superiority as shown by Grisha rekting Geographia and now recently MT rekting Reiner. Titans also behave towards MT as an alpha presence. And the true enemy, that Ymir was about tell Eren, could well be the Yaeger tribe who supposedly has been giving the BRA faction all sorts of trouble (the irony). Going with the pointy years/animal-esque titan clue, Ymir seems to have taken their serum as well.<br><br>I wonder how the Ackerman family connects with this all. I think they might be actually related to the Yaeger tribe too. Remember Grisha was taking medical care of Mikasa.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I read chapter 70 and all I see are two friends hanging out.</br>  <br>Some people actually believe it.</br>  <br/>  Is JH even a possibility?  <br>It's obvious that Eren has no feelings for her, but Historia's slowly falling for him, for now it's just a crush or infatuation, but the attraction is clearly there. <br><br>Too bad for her though, Mikasa already won.</br></br></br>  <br>So if Mikasa made Historia blush you fags would deny any romance but because it's the ragetard MC every girl who even looks at him has to be wet for his emo ass.</br>  <br> Historia clearly tells Eren she really like the fact that he called her "normal" <br> Eren tells her she is a great person and made her blush <br> Mikasa jealous af <br> Jean pointing out how Eren and Historia got closer <br>Yeah, stay in denial but Isayama is clearly trying to get them to be closer.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> this is what delusional people believe </br>  <br>/a/ hates anything even HINTING at yuri, it's nothing new.</br>  <br> being this mad over a fictional pairing </br>  <br>The Ackermen and the Orientals were buddies with the Reiss, only their kids got revolted. The serum BRA village holds was probably a tentative to copy the Jaegar's serum.</br>  <br> Remember Grisha was taking medical care of Mikasa. <br>I was just thinking about this. Maybe he was studying the Ackerman and Asian blood to help make the perfect serum for Eren.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, as friends.</br>  <br>If Eren marries Mikasa and has a thing with queen Historia then who the fuck is Jean left with?</br>  <br>So you must be an anti-yurifag to see that Isayama is pushing for EH?</br>  <br> Mikasa already won. <br><br> No blush. </br></br></br>  <br>Girls can just be friends with guys but it's not like you neckbeards will ever speak to a girl anyway so you wouldn't know a thing about social relationships.</br>  Fucking shitstain shipperfags ruin everything  <br> Mikasa already won <br>Please. Eren would rather commit sudoku over getting together with Mankasa. The most she'll ever have is his lifeless body, assuming it won't disappear.</br></br>  <br>Probably Islamfag samefagging again.</br>  <br>As always.</br>  <br>Never said anything about that, friend.<br>Just commenting of the first part of his post.</br></br>  <br> implying </br>  <br> Eren made Jean's bed <br> Jean defends the waifu <br> Jean is alpha as fuck </br></br></br>  <br>True, Eren and Armin will obviously be together.</br>  <br> Never said anything about that <br> if you don't accept that YH is canon you must be an anti-yurifag </br></br>  <br> A kid <br> Just met <br>She'll fuck up soon.</br></br></br>  <br>The cunt was the useless pathetic cuck who couldn't do his fucking job and lost his shit at a baby.</br>  Naked shotaren with lolistoria when.  <br>Exactly. Boypussy&gt;&gt;&gt;girldick.</br>  <br>What?<br>I don't see how my post implied that.<br>YH is a shit ship anyway, since Y hopefully died painfully.</br></br></br>  <br>What happened to naked Nifa?</br>  <br> backpedaling this hard </br>  shipperfagless kyojin thread when  <br>His hair's a lot better now at least.</br>  <br>We had it already. <br><br><br> Seconding. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Islamfag go kill yourself already.</br>  Does anyone still have the cute ass lil Shitstoria pic?<br>She has little text bubble where she goes, "Eh?" she's all happy and dumb looking and shit.<br><br>Shitkasa too they are both hilarious as fuck.<br><br>Anyone still have them?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>naked Nifa a dead. Naked Shotaren and Lolistoria it is.</br>  <br> Q: Were Eren and Armin not with their other batchmates a lot? <br> A: There was once a rumor going around that the two of them were too close. <br>This needs to be on the EA collage.</br></br></br>    Grisha indirectly made EH canon. Since he slaughtered all the Reisses but spared Lolistoria. He must be weeping in his grave that his son managed to score a queen and become the King himself.    <br>Historia is a lesbian.</br>  <br>Show me where either of my posts implied YH is canon then.</br>  <br>For Ellen.</br>  <br>Nice. YH and Annie when?</br>  Are we going to see Eren and Historia's wedding?  <br>Go away Jean.</br>  <br><br>Do these round out the giveaway drawings or are there going to be more?<br> no Annie illustration <br>;_;</br></br></br></br>  <br>For Erin.</br>  <br>Will all characters get a drawing?</br>  <br>Mikasa is his first love. Deal with it, EHfag.</br>  <br>Well Ellen Degeneres is a lesbian so yes.</br>  <br>Mikasa pls.</br>  <br>Well apparently he looks like a women.</br>  <br>Babe just hear me out.<br><br>Just love me alright?</br></br></br>  I think EH will name their first daughter Mikasa for the extra stab in the heart.  <br><br>she only wants him because he reminds her of nee-san</br></br>  Imagine how much better these threads would be without EMfags, LMfags and especially EHfags.  <br>As they're fucking she screams out her nee-sama's name.</br>  <br>Leave as soon as they show up.<br><br>I just reached the bottom of the thread and its time to go. Good discussion up top until the retards shown up.</br></br></br>  <br> So does Eren. </br>  On a more serious note, it's undeniable that Historia &gt; Eren has way more hints than Annie &gt; Eren which I already considered to be complete delusion.  <br>It's in the usual place.</br>  <br>Not really.</br>  Jean is going to win the Mikasab owl. After she walks in on Eren and Historia fucking like rabbits, her heart will break in a million pieces, then she'll run into Jean's arms for comfort.  <br> has way more hints <br>I see no hints to begin with. Not even joking.</br></br>  <br> delusion <br>Bert please, there's no shame in admitting you lost to the better man.</br></br>  Are these 2 perfect for each other?<br>Yes.<br><br>Literally match made in heaven and Ymir gets to turn straight after some late night funsies.</br></br></br>  <br> you make me happy, Eren <br> I'll be on your side no matter what <br> blush <br><br><br><br>Yeah, Annie &gt; Eren has no hints. Isayama even confirmed that there's only mutual respect there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Evangelion <br> Yamato <br> Lost </br></br></br>  <br>I like pictures where everyone is just chilling. Historia looks warm in her poncho but why is she the color of watermelon and Sasha's face looks weird.</br>  <br> no "you too" </br>  <br>Go away, Eren, Annie will never like you back.</br>  Does Carla look like a man or does Eren look like a woman. Which is it  <br>I see no hints for EH either.</br>  <br>That's not Bertymir.</br>  <br>everyone looks androgynously pretty except the manly men</br>  <br> What was the entire last arc <br> You want me to do a collage, don't you? </br></br>  <br>I can make a whole porn book for EAr if I put all those lines the way you did.</br>  <br>Not him but I unfortunately can see where EHfags are coming from.</br>  <br>Sounds like a nice friendship. Also, Historia is blushing all the time. Actually everyone does and it doesn't mean anything.</br>  <br>Carla looks like a woman. Eren also looks like a guy, but that might be because I'm so used to the feminine style in which guys are drawn that it just looks normal.</br>  <br>Were they? Will probably have to re-read some of the latest chapters again, but weren't they actually pursued because they could resist the mindwiping/controlling powers of the Reiss family?<br><br>Also the more I think about it, the more I realize that the Walls and BRA are probably actually related, going with their serums and Titan designs. Possibly were one and the same at some point in the far past but were forced to split with one side being isolationist while the other sought a more combat and warring front against their enemy.</br></br></br>  <br>Do it so we can debate how romantic/10 it was.</br>  <br>She blushed for Hanji. HH is canon.</br>  <br>This. I hate EH but I can see why people would think Isayama's been pushing it.</br>  <br>It reminds me a lot of Jean/Marco and Jean/Armin shippers.</br>  <br>Romantic hints? The fuck man?</br>  <br> JM <br>This is how I see EH tbh.</br></br>  <br>Mikasa you can cry on my shoulder if you want to babe.<br><br>I even wrote a song for you. <br>Because you know I love you right?</br></br></br></br>   all this YHfag denial   <br>Who is Marco?</br>  <br>It's pretty much the same thing.</br>  <br>Bert wouldn't stand a chance.</br>  <br>Why would titans from the north be larger?</br>  <br>Reread chapter 70. Everything priuor to that could have been interpreted as just friendship but chapter 70 confirmed that it is romantic and everything that happened between them in the political arc was for the purpose of developing their romantic relationship.</br>  <br> people talking to each-other means they have to be in love <br>Give actual proov.</br></br>  <br>How? Their dynamic is completely different.</br>  <br>Reiner, Bert and Ymir only like tiny blondes.</br>  <br>Not really. It's still friendship.</br>  <br>The theme is the same.<br><br><br> replying to posts like that </br></br></br></br>  all you shipperfags are a waste of life  <br>more proof than this you won't need remember I prefer YH but this is how it is</br>  <br>I was talking about the autistic shipperfags.</br>  <br> Special people have a hard time understanding normals. <br>The fucking irony being that Shadis used to think that about everyone who criticized him for his shit, until he realized he was the gold standard for average.<br>Hell, what Hange said to him isn't that far form what he pettily said to Carla.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off to /d2g/ you filthy /v/ermin.</br>  <br>Kill yourself you delusional shit.</br>  <br>Will you be killing yourself when EH start fucking as rabbits?</br>  <br>Looked more like a comedy relief moment to me. Especially since MH just started to walk away together without Eren.</br>  <br>this thread is so SHYYYEEEEEHHHHHTTT</br>  <br> mfw I'll never cuddle Ymir or Annie </br>  <br>Eren doesn't give a fuck.<br>Historia blushing because got complimented and embarrassed after got reminded of what she said.<br>Mikasa being autistic like always.<br>So?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure. Bergmann's rule?</br>  <br>They will turn into rabbits?</br>  <br> that murderous gaze <br> that possessiveness <br>Right... just for comedic purposes. Anon just accept that Ymir lost, she never had a chance</br></br></br>  <br> mfw i cuddled both <br> at the same damn time </br></br>  <br>In his mind that's possible too.</br>  <br>It was a comedy scene. You don't even have to be a YHfag/EMfag to point that out.</br>  <br> Eren doesn't give a fuck <br> all he can do is talk about how amazing Historia is </br></br>  Have you sworn you complete and undying allegiance to Ainz-sama today?<br><br>And before anyone ask:<br><br>Do we really need another thread? Well yes, Ainz demands it you inferior meatbag.<br>Yes the framerate for the first episode sucks, blame funi, use [ayy]<br>Do you want to read the novel? https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA<br><br>Also Vol 9 spoilers for the first chapter:<br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Have you sworn you complete and undying allegiance to Ainz-sama today? <br>I've tried, but he stopped returning my calls.</br></br>  Threadly reminders:<br><br>This is the worst fanbase/threads of the season, see pic related<br>Everyone here is the  little girl  's skeleton <br>Narbel? more like Narbest <br> Albedo is fine too </br></br></br></br></br>    I guess we ran out of things to talk about till Tuesday.  <br><br>It seems so, welp can't be helped.</br></br>    <br>Threads should only pop up when a new episode or a new chapter from Sky is released.<br><br>keeps the purity of the threads</br></br></br>  <br> keeps the purity of the threads <br><br>Except for a few guys the threads have been quite nice actually. But don't worry it's inevitable that once the anime ends these threads will return to being pretty much low profile.</br></br></br>  Don't make Albedo sad. This is heresy.   this thread   <br>do not forget the drama cd's..... those abs man</br>  I rise this thread from the dead in the name of Nazarick.  <br>You monster</br>  Want to Touch Me?  <br>I don't understand.</br>    <br>But touch me didn't make maids.<br> He made gentleman. </br></br>  <br>Did you guys really have to make it a general?</br>  <br>It wasn't me</br>  <br><br><br><br>It was me, I'm sorry ;_;</br></br></br></br>    Still waiting for vol 9 scans.  We still ain't found a better episode one yet?  Wow, suddenly there's a big influx of lewd Overlord on pixiv    Poor  Arche . The Japanese Overlord readership who voted in that poll are completely ruthless.  <br>Has anyone even managed to survive a poll before? I think the closest case of someone who should die but lived was  Marquis Raven but then Gazef had to die for him. </br>  <br>At least Akenest won't be alone with Nabest anymore.</br>  <br>Was Gazef voted down too or just author asking if Raven lives or dies?</br>  <br>I still can't get over that. The only consolation I get is that he at least got to live for 8 volumes while the unfortunate ones like the Swords of Darkness and  Arche  perished in the same volume they were introduced.</br>  <br>Oh man, if it's this bad now with them just seeing Albedo, we're going to get fanart out the wazoo with the other girls when they show up.</br>  <br>Gentleman that can charm any woman out there. Can't wait for his time to shine getting tl'd.</br>  <br>I look forward to people misrepresenting Mare.</br>  <br>Also, I like how not one picture of Albedo shows her with Ainz. Get your shit together artists. I know it's hard to bone the Bone, but be creative. <br><br><br>Well, I found one, but it's not appropriate for here. Oddly the ONLY lewd one with Papa Bones.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Best one so far</br>  <br>He is pretty self-concious about the skirt's length. Can't wait if he manages to score himself spoils of war. <br><br>Though to get handle said spoils and to even manage to get offspring in the works he probably has to consult Demiurge and Aura would probably butt in too. Too innocent.</br></br></br>    <br>Self-concious he may be but that skirt is never coming off since it is from his creator.</br>  <br>It'll be amusing what kind doujins will pop out. Laziest copoutd will probably go for Papa Bones regaining his salaryman form just because.<br><br>As long as its not faceless bald men and has some creativity to it, I wouldn't mind. Either nips manage to surprise me or I'll be let down as usual.</br></br></br>  <br>No clue, just pointing out a case where a guy who died in the WN managed to live. Oh wait, there is one other exception who got off completely free no strings attached: Brain. I mean heck he even inherits Gazef's shit so he's now the strongest pure/non-awakened human since Clementine is dead.</br>  <br>Will be interesting to see if Brain manages to stay human and avoid his fate from WN catching up as a job of manicurist.<br><br>And if Gazef truly remains that way, I'd say Papa Bones might have some use for him.</br></br></br>  So speculation time: good end or dead end for Ainz and Nazarick at the end of the series.<br><br>Personally, I think Ainz's  independent kingdom's  going to grow and fill up with more nonhuman races until he's the Overlord of more than just Nazarick. He'll probably call  his kingdom the Great Kingdom of Nazarick  or along those lines. You know how he sucks at naming shit. Now, assuming the Kingdom and the Empire are successful in uniting  against Ainz , they'll be relying on the power of the great Momon. Imagine their shock when the truth about him comes out.</br></br>  <br>Nah, he'll lead the best of best what humanity has to offer through Nazarick. Letting all the worthless die to auto-spawns and traps and keep Guardians in the Throne Room.<br><br>Then walk with the few worthy survivors to Throne Room and walk up the stairs to the throne, dispel his guise and activate limited Despair Aura and ask them, submit or die.</br></br></br>  <br>That would be a pretty badass way of doing things. And he's apparently already had practice in volume 9 with the  Emperor .</br>  <br>Even if it isn't dead end there's going to be retribution for certain. I've never read a published piece of fiction on the same level of popularity/sales as Overlord that lets a villain get away with all that shit he does, whether or not you sympathize with him.</br>  <br> wanting humans <br>pretty sure with   Gazef dead   there aren't any humans that might survive nazarick left<br><br>anyways my prediction is that Nazarick is gonna establish itself and then in a few years or decades the largest player transition yet happens as some place where people were holding an end of the game celebration gets pulled over</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just what are you expecting to happen to the MC of a LN, villain or not?</br>   Albedo is bitch in heat. <br> Rolling around in men's bed sheets. <br><br> I hope anime doesn't skip this. </br></br></br>  <br>They shouldn't. I mean, it's part of a scene.</br>  <br>We SAO now.<br><br>I only read 2 novels, but from I read, only way for anyone to get even though first level is for Nazarick to help the world's adventurers to power level.</br></br></br>  <br>What an adorable overlord.</br>  You now realize if Herohero had trudge along another half hour online, he would be in Za Warudo kicking ass with Momonga.  I think the nazarick tomb will remain unconquered all to the end of the series.<br>My guess is that Ainz will find a world class item that can take him home, but the guardians will find out about it and hide it in the tomb.<br>Making the last arc on how Ainz will raid his own tomb along with the human companions he gained as Momon.</br></br>  <br>Oops forgot to link reply<br/></br>  <br>He already has like... two or three wish items.<br><br>He should be capable of wishing himself human, then wishing himself back to Earth. He just doesn't want to. Being an immortal sorcerer in a fantasy world with a suicidally loyal army of super-monsters is pretty sweet compared to being a passionless, no friends, no family salary drone.<br><br>He can't even play his favorite game anymore!</br></br></br></br></br>  Just finished volume 4. Not as bad as I heard it was but I suppose reading it all at once instead of in chapters made a world of difference.<br><br> Ainz bullying cute Lizardmen. <br>Stop being so mean, Supreme Overlord of Death.<br><br>Can someone spoil me on whether  Zenburu and the older brother will be revived as well?  </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Perhaps no, but I can a see a volume dedicated on how the Guardians deal with Ainz being a Human on the inside and how they, after all, were created by other humans and were basically toys on a dead game. That would be interesting.</br></br>  <br>Will i turn into a spooky laughing skeleton?</br>  <br> Blood Emperor just walked his ass in there. </br>  <br>Well the wish spell clearly has limitations it would be pretty game breaking if it had that much power.<br>I think the wish can only do what all the abilities in the game can do, and not actually go in to game breaking category like word class items.<br>As for why he would return, well I'm sure he wont stay the same one dimensional character throughout the series and will actually change his mind set, either through meeting a certain person, or just because there are no other players in the game, and he will feel bored.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really, Ainz is too paranoid to bring him to the actual tomb in the LN (he did in the WN).  In Vol. 9, he brought them to the warehousing Aura was building.  </br>  <br>His cover gets blown, shit hits the fan, and he loses something he can't get back. Whether or not it GAME OVERS him is another matter entirely, but I've yet to see a fiction that supports an MC who tells black lies on top of black lies in order to sustain themselves enough to let them get away with it with a happy ending.<br><br>It'd be refreshing if he managed to pull it off, but I just haven't ever seen it happen.</br></br></br>  <br>He died and reincarnated into a slime though. And is going about his new life in the complete opposite direction of Ainz.</br>  <br>That's the shittiest idea I've read so far regarding Overlord. Might as well have Touch Me come preach to Ainz and have him save the world afterwards and solve world hunger and obtain world peace while you're at it.<br><br>Only Naofumi gets to go home, and that's cause he's got LONG work hours.</br></br></br>  <br> Might as well have Touch Me come preach to Ainz and have him save the world afterwards and solve world hunger and obtain world peace while you're at it. <br> Implying Touch Me won't descend from the heavens, like the godly being he is, when Ainz fight the 8 Kings. </br></br>  <br> Touch Me turns out to be Onii-sama in his later years <br><br>It all makes sense now. No wonder Ulbert was jealous as fuck.</br></br></br>  Who is Touch Me?  <br>Our one true Savior</br>  <br>Yeah but who?</br>  <br>The first guild leader, and the guy who saved and encouraged Momonga to keep playing. <br><br>One of the most powerful players in the history of the original MMO, as well as the creator of Sebastian. <br><br>Or you can just look for this on the internet.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's a retired guild member</br>  <br>They were rezzed in the WN but no idea if they have bwen in LN, yet.</br>  <br>And the man was impresse by it, what a madman. A damn warehouse with tomb extension, sorry Aura.</br>  <br>Some people really do believe it has to end in a good end with whole Nazarick turning into World Saviors and protectors of the weak. Just because Papa Bones used to be human so he should return to being one!</br>  <br>I always imagine it ending with a bitter sweet tone.<br>Something like Ainz-sama fighting off a too powerful foe, and being left in a coma like state, with the guardians and all the resisdents of Nazarick standing guard promising to wait for him to awaken.</br></br>  <br>I'd be fine with anything that fullfills the eternal legend goal, and yeah, hopefully with Nazarick as whole standing, without Papa Bones or not.</br>    Tuesday can't coming fast enough...  What subs are the best for this show? Should I just go with DeadFish?  <br>Dead/Bakedfish is a toaster/console/phonepleb re-encode group anon. [ayy] is the best option but they will wait for bs11 raw that airs on Thursdays.</br>  <br>maybe in season 2 we will see ainz doing that</br>  <br>that could be after find a player.Maybe there will be a time lapse, who knows, maybe spinel, and last born could give a hint.</br>   start off as NTR <br> the protag beats the shit out of the guy <br> second chapter is vanilla <br> yfw </br></br></br>  <br>I wanna see this</br>  <br> NTR <br>You already know its gonna be a fucked story</br></br>  <br>Even if the guy gets his ass beat the girl is still a slut the moment another man touches her.</br>  <br> third chapter protag gets raped by girls <br> fourth chapter girl gets raped by girls who raped protag <br> yfw you have no face </br></br></br>  <br>Who is that? This is an anime board</br>  <br>still NTR no amount of vanilla can save it. I hate it when this happens NTR then it has a happy ending. Faggot MC is a definite cuck. Idiots who likes it are cucks as well</br>  <br>The guy who left this place to teach us all a lesson on posting content and discussion relevant to the board in question.</br>  Why are anti-NTRfags so fucking obnoxious and pathetic? I don't care about NTR at all nor do I particularly like it, but I've never seen a thread about how good NTR is, just a bunch of beta teens complaining about how they don't like it. Are they really so beta and that much of a cuck that they can't help but insert as the beta faggot getting cheated on?  <br> ntr <br> Happy ending  <br><br>Please post some examples</br></br></br></br>  <br>Who is the dude in the front?<br><br> I see pics of him from time to time around here and he's apparently famous here too.</br></br></br>  <br>Uh you are doing it wrong mate, you are suppose to self insert as the girl.</br>  <br>I thought anyone fapping to any sort of porn just self inserts as the penis. Who the fuck is stupid enough to self insert as the loser? Losers themselves? Is this why can't beta cucklords can't handle NTR?</br>  <br>forgot the title but it was a Grill who has so sheltered she was getting gangbanged daily but because of Happy Ending beta MC still got together with her. There are a few of it but i forgot about them.</br>  <br>If there is rape nothing is happy.<br><br>If the girl is a slut and is cheating on her lover nothing is happy.<br><br>And if the girl is a slut before getting together with the MC but is not cheating on him when they are together it's not NTR.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it was a Grill who has so sheltered she was getting gangbanged daily <br>i don't think i follow</br></br>  <br>it's most probably because idiots are so used with Haremshit and MC always getting their Grills that they're offended by the thought of the usual self-insert getting cucked.</br>  <br>the guy who split touhou from anime and decided captcha will cure us all</br>  <br>pic related</br>   start off as NTR <br> the protag fuck the guy who fuck his wife <br> threesome happy ending <br><br>The doujishi called "Night Stories from a Chinese Studio" anyway</br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally who?</br>  <br>But how stupid are you supposed to be to think the person getting cucked is supposed to be the self-insert? Usually the person who does the NTRing is supposed the be the self-insert, since they're always fat or ugly, which is what most people who fap to hentai are. NTR is the ultimate power fantasy, so I don't get why betacucks hate it.</br>  <br><br><br>this is the stupidest maymay</br></br></br>  <br><br>they were in love with each other, but the usual hentai idiocy was in the way so she gets gangbanged non-stop till MC finds out tries to stop it. Gets wrecked either way. And Happy Ending. Good Fap but it's better if a story is NTR better Make it full blown NTR. MC just looked like a beta faggot who couldn't move on so stayed with idiot sheltered girl</br></br>  <br>When you watch any anime with a male lead MC, and then watch an NTR, you might automatically self-insert as the beta because in your typical anime, that's the main character.<br>Of course, kids who end up watching NTR will feel the burn. Its a clever trap.<br><br>I actually think that "fictional" NTR is fine, but if I were to openly discuss it, I'd be accused of being a cuck.<br>In a way, NTR is actually representative of how your typical anime relationship dynamics would go on in real life.<br><br>But whenever I see one, its often "very situational". MC needs something that his girl can give, but the girl relies on a third party to give it, so the stress of thinking about a solution to a "non-resolvable" plot point, adds to the NTR-feel.<br>Example: That NTR story where the girls and guys are trapped in a cave in/ building after an earthquake. You'll think about how they're getting out, but it actually never happens. The only thing that happens is the NTR. They all die in the end. (An auto resolve scenario?)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're supposed to self-insert with the girl, sillies.</br></br>  <br>That Chinaman, knows whats good</br>  <br>I remember this one, GOAT. Surprise there isn't other one like that.</br>  <br>I do that with MTSP. not so much with other artists. His dialogue is what makes his stories a hundred times arousing</br>  We can dream, brother.      <br>That "it really hurts to have your hymen torn" one. The MC keeps her after all that shit, probably pregnant from fat men gang banging her and everything.</br>  <br>Why are people who hate NTR so insufferable?</br>  <br>that was in actuality a stupid story. Like 90% of hentai out there </br>  <br><br> newfags will unironically say this in the future </br></br>  <br> because of this meme we will not be able to tell when the question will start being asked unironically </br>  <br> guy sneaks into house dressed as girl <br> guy NTRs other guy <br> guy he NTRed fucks him in the ass <br> nightly threesomes with his wife and NTR trap </br></br></br></br>  <br>I will never understand this shit, both IRL and in fiction<br><br> Woman cheats on a man with another man <br> Somehow this other man is to blame <br> The woman is completely innocent <br> Even though she's the one in an established relationship <br> Even though she had the responsibility to be loyal <br><br>What I'd like to see is NTR where the guy who was cheated on beats the shit out of his disloyal whore. It's always nice to see people get what's coming to them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The male lead is to blame if you empathize with the woman. This rarely happens.<br>The woman doesn't think she's innocent, she just embraces becoming a slut. This is actually all there is to it.</br></br>  <br>Mtsp is pretty tame though it doesn't even feel like ntr, more like cheating/prostitution. Also every time there is a shota in it like in hanahook, it breaks my spension of belief instantly. Reason why is because its so unrealistic, that it doesn't bother me and become easily fapable.</br>  <br>the happiest</br>  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/628602/25efdc<wbr>9d66/</wbr></br>  <br>Isn't like 60% of NTR from Rape Magic?</br>  <br>Well, if it's rape that changes things a lot. No matter what SJW may say about "rape culture", most people agree that in the case of rape the rapee (regardless of gender) is generally blameless.</br>  <br>aain't nothing happy about that<br><br>and that imouto is cray throwing everything out like that</br></br></br>  <br>New Otomedori when?</br>  Chains of Kust was pretty good NTR.<br>It combined Netorare and Netori together.<br><br>MC get a new girlfriend and douchebag brother NTR's him, what happend is that the girlfriend of douchebag bro finds out about the NTR and has sex with the NTR'd brother, of course douchebag bro finds out and gets pissed and an NTR war ensues.</br></br></br>  <br>Finally a brother that I can relate too.</br>  <br><br>Eh, who cares. I don't miss him, personally. It was fun when he got drunk and fucked with the boards format, though.</br></br>  <br> mind control, drugs, rape, Raildex, Biribiri <br> it's secretly vanilla where Touma beats the shit out of the would-be rapists for not living their lives correctly <br>One of the best surprises I've ever gotten while fapping.</br></br></br>  <br>When I first started reading manga there was this one about a chick who got raped and then had a baby. She either gave it up or aborted it, can't remember, but the Mc falls for her and happy ending ensues. Don't really know if it's ntr or not though.</br>  <br>Bitter Virgin? I think she had the first one and aborted/miscarried the second one, while MC believes their relationship won't last at the end.</br>  <br>Who is the guy in this picture?</br>  <br>The cuckmaster.</br>  <br>The toilet doujin from Hakaba.</br>  <br>pic<br><br><br>Why is /a/ infested with /v/ermins more than usual?</br></br></br></br>  <br>isnt that the one where the older brother got drugged and died from it?</br>  <br>Yeah, I just Googled it. Spot on,anon. God, that was 9 years ago. I need to reevaluate my life choices.</br>  <br><br><br><br> 2008+7 <br> not knowing Marc Zuckerberg, creator of reddit </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 2008+7 <br>What does it mean?</br></br>  <br>2017-2</br>  <br>That's David Karp you retard</br>  <br>What are you trying to tell me?</br>  <br>it's obviously Benedict Cumberbatch</br>   NTR <br> the MC is the one doing the NTRing on an unwitting couple </br>  <br>Saint Fiore</br>  <br>it's called netori</br>  chapter 03    <br>choose between those two next pics</br>          <br>I'd say this.

Are you always lurking /a/ or something?</br>  <br>What, that's it?!</br>  <br>He should redraw that whole section.

I know Fate is 10 years old, but don't spoil all that shit like it's nothing for fuck's sake.</br>  <br> but don't spoil <br>Most of the people reading it are VN players, it leaves room for extra exposition and more stuff that wasn't shown or fully explained in the VN.<br>Why cater to the lower percentage?<br> inb4 90% vs 10% </br></br></br></br>  <br>When you put it like that, yeah, fuck secondaries.</br>  <br>I thought the manga would get quite a lot of readers who just watched UBW and are waiting for the HF movies</br>   This was one of the opening pages to the first chapter <br> Dark Sakura probably isn't going to appear for half a decade </br>  <br><br>You sure?</br></br>  <br>That's a big head.</br>  <br><br> 4u </br></br>  <br> We won't see Best Sakura for half a decade <br>Why does it hurt so much?</br></br>  <br>Most of the people who watched UBW read the VN already, seriously they have a scroll in every episode promoting the VN, it's even on the Appstore and it was free during UBW's airing. Even if they didn't read the VN they probably watched Zero already.<br>The people you are thinking off are a very, very small minority.</br></br>  <br> Best Sakura <br> not BB </br></br>  <br>Wasn't only Fate free?</br>  <br>as you want, i will upload it tomorrow anyway.</br>  <br>UBW was free during the 2nd cour like how Fate was free during the first, you still have to buy HF though which would tempt most people into buying it.</br>  <br><br>I mean, at this point I could redraw the whole thing.<br><br>But if you want only that, then okay.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Saber does it for free?</br>  <br>let's go with the whole thing, it will look better.</br>  <br>Fuck you, Sakura. You horrible manipulative woman. You can't tell people what to do and not give them a resonable explanation for it. God damn who the fuck decided this bitch should get her own route? Thank goodness it's only going to be one movie.</br>  <br>Task Ohna just wanted to draw Dark Sakura right away. Can't blame him, she does weird things to my dick.</br>  <br>She takes her job very seriously.</br>  <br>What? How? You imagine her using her shadow dress to jack you off or something you damn pervert?</br>  <br>  Thank goodness it's only going to be one movie. <br><br>More than one; it's obvious.</br></br></br>  <br>If Deen can make UBW in 90 minutes, ufo can make HF in 120.<br>Believe in them.</br></br>  <br>Sakurafags on suicide watch. I wish I had a button to shock every single one of them.</br>  Miura's big idea for HF was to make a single six hour movie. He said that it'd be impossible, though.  <br>that's why i think of several movies.</br>  <br>The guy is cat on head retarded.</br>  <br>That's gonna get shaved down into 3.<br> Unless Ufotable just animates the cool scenes and an ending then at the end of the credits there is a huge "READ THE FUCKING VN" plastered on the screen. </br></br>  <br>Or he might just be an insane genius?</br>  <br>Miura is our guy. Don't hate our guy..</br>  <br>I'd watch that.</br>  <br>Why is her telling him to try to avoid getting involved in this magus death fight so he won't die so "FUCK YOU, GO DIE" type bad? Of course she can't tell him that its a magus death fight, since he doesn't really know anything about magus stuff beyond his father telling him a few stories, and it would be revealing more than a few things about herself as well.<br><br>Well maybe she could tell him a bit more, but as said a few seconds ago that would lead into a dozen other conversations like "Yes I'm a magus as well", and if you know her character she wants to just be normal around him since that's her sanctuary.<br><br>So she just asked him to trust her and go with it for now, just stay in for tonight. The amount of time they've been together should be worth at least that much even without much explanation given.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was Kondo (ufo's producer) who had that wild fantasy.</br>  <br>I'd rather the 6 hour movie. Better than waiting fucking forever to see the scenes you want animated.</br>  Only one movie: https://soundcloud.com/karoshi-4/vo<wbr>ice-003-001</wbr>  <br>Has there ever been an anime movie with a runtime that is even close to that?</br>  <br>I think the longest, outside of any potential weird arthouse stuff, is around two and a half hours.</br>  <br>We have went over this already, what is really said and what the TM Ace says about it.</br>  <br>What's the difference besides darker levels?</br>  Does anyone know what this tweet is going on about?  <br>Just look closely at the moon<br><br>Pics from http://bosel.blog64.fc2.com/blog-en<wbr>try-3778.html</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>God Sakura's head looks weird.</br>  Task Ohna's drawing    <br>So pretty</br>  Soon<br> Character popularity poll <br>https://twitter.com/prisma_illya/st<wbr>atus/616582279238791168</wbr></br></br>  <br> Rin &gt; Luvia </br>  <br>5 hour movie confirmed?</br>  <br>Lord of the ring: 4 hours</br>  <br>I was thinking anime specifically.</br>  <br>Anon mentioned Anime movie.</br>  one movie is really not enough, what are they thinking?? the sales were not good? not as good as Zero?<br><br>Gotta' lower my expectations if it is confirmed...</br></br>  <br>I'm guessing it's some new/expanded scenes.</br>  <br>We have nothing fully confirmed yet. They haven't even started production on it. They're too busy working on this masterpiece.</br>  <br>BAZETT FLASHBACK CONFIRMED</br>  <br>That's Takeuchi btw.</br>    <br>And people wonder why they keep sucking Nasu's dick.</br>  Before I go, I leave this here. Just in case.  Thanks for the hard work guys! Hoping next months chapter goes up to Rin and Shirou meeting each other.  <br><br>You are shitting me.</br></br>  <br>nah I haven't browsed 4chan in years. I just followed the link in the BL thread.</br>  <br>Fair enough. The shitposting is too much sometimes, but other than that we can have nice threads and the fanbase here is dedicated.</br>  <br>I am... but wouldn't that be awesome?</br>  <br>Good call, we can be pretty shitty 90% of the time here.</br>  <br>Yeah, this thread is pretty 10%.</br>  <br>If they didn't have Bazett in the main series, I doubt it's something they would hold out for the BDs. Ufo either decided it wasn't relevant enough to UBW or they're saving her for HA.</br>  <br>She was indirectly mentioned in episode 14.</br>  <br> HA <br>How would they even do it? TV series? OVA? How much SOL, how much backstory, how much plot?</br></br>  Google translate synopsis from something in the volume release<br><br> Nasu mushroom teacher also talks about one page plump this Komikaraizu the guest comment. <br> This Komikaraizu planning seems to have apparently moved from two years ago. <br><br>  Tasukuona's "Nasu-san. Although I what an even say such things in the opposite station" <br>  Nasu wrote: "Yes, what'll we currently Bucchigiri first place Kusoya ...... <br>  Nevertheless, your friendly Tasukuona's. <br>  Watakushi, only Tsumo up of the parent because soon jump unlikely but please forgive me. " <br>  Tasukuona's "do not do such outrageous conduct. I'm a serious story, <br>  Hayate decades from playing Fate. <br>  ... In fact from the time that, I wanted to try to cartoon of cherry root. <br>  Experience in this three years I was loading. There is also a strength for the simultaneous series. <br>  First or Ron would not get to hear just talk, <br>  The Doraron, fly in the parent twice and Kinoko~o!

A series of vignettes with about 1/4 of them being the main story sounds balanced.</br></br></br>  <br>Please Takeuchi, no more ahoges. Just get Sakura's curves right and we'll be fine.</br>  <br>That's not an ahoge, that's just a strand of hair.</br>  <br> cartoon of cherry root </br>    <br>The common joke to say right now is that rather than being gay, that's masturbation. Truthfully though, it's just gay.<br><br>Shirou and Archer have the same starting points, but their end points will be different. They're two distinct individuals, and if one plows the other's man hole, then that's one separate being fucking another.</br></br></br>  <br>C'mon anon<br><br>What could possibly be gay about two men getting intimate in a sexual nature? What could possibly be homosex about two men getting together and having some man on man time? <br><br>You're out of it, nothing about that sounds gay at all, its one of the most hetero activities you might find.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Shirou is no longer alone. Archer is waiting for him in the future. <br><br>Gay</br></br></br>  <br>Scans from Newtype are out? Got anymore?</br>  <br>Saber isn't relevant in UBW either but they still inserted a bunch of half-assed flashbacks in episode 21.</br>  <br>Saber is a semi-relevant side character in UBW. She roughly gets the same character arc as she did in the Fate route, it's just not front and center.</br>  <br> Heaven Feel's PV is 4 shots of Sakura turning around </br>  <br>That's all they animated. That shit ain't coming for years.</br>  <br> and if you know her character she wants to just be normal around him since that's her sanctuary. <br><br>And that makes her a selfish manipulative bitch. If you care for someone you fucking tell them what's up. No excues. Sakura has nothing but execuses and she's a pain to deal with. Just tell him you can do magic, Don't let him nearly suicide himself every night when you know it's a bad method you fucking bitch! And Sakurafags clam that she loves him?</br></br></br>  Thank you for all your time, effort and interest, HF manga team!  <br> Prin- <br> touts <br><br>It should be print-outs, anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>No Fate/hollow ataraxia content, I think.</br>  <br><br>&lt;3</br></br>  <br>...but in the end, it doesn't even matter.</br>  <br>You're kind of pushing this in her own direction entirely, and then going an extra ten feet with it.<br><br>A friend even if they don't explain everything that's up, just them asking you to do something for them is usually enough. You just go "You're my bro, so I'll listen seriously since you seem serious'. You can't always explain it to them right now, you listen to them if they're serious, and if you need to know what it was about after then they will tell you.<br><br>If she thought his life was seriously in danger with the grail war she would have done something more, but at this point it was still just a bad feeling for her.<br><br>She doesn't know magic any more than him to correct him about the proper way to do it. She was never trained at all, she was just abused. The most she could say is "Fucking stop, that's dangerous", but she can't show him anything correct. He wouldn't stop because "I just need to do this, if it can help anyone then I must" train, rather than him finding it fun or anything. He already knew exactly what he was doing anyway, there was no mistake so much. She's afraid that he would think differently of her if she showed her hand, she tried to solve it in an indirect manner without risking everything by just asking him to trust her and don't go out for the next day until she gets back.<br><br>If her hunch was nothing then it would be no big deal, and she would be back the next day to watch over him again. She's not really manipulating here, she's just afraid and it feels like her world is kind of breaking down since she thought she left this grail war bullshit behind giving her servant to Shinji, so she could go back to her normal life, only to find out it was uprooted anyway since Shirou was maybe chosen as well.<br><br>It's like "Was that all for nothing?". A passive feeling where you fool yourself that nothing will change here, but maybe its already too late.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best girl makes an appearance.</br>  <br>RIN A BEST!</br>  <br>Do you have a version with the text, based Heart?</br>  <br><br>With or without?</br></br>  <br>Without the text, please.

She just wants to lock him away in her nice little happy place regardless of Shirou's feelings on the matter and that's selfish,anon. Sakura's love is a selfish love just like Saber's love is a ridiculously unrealistic one where she has to basically degrade herself mind,body and soul just so that Shirou can take the lead. It really shows that Nasu did not set out originally to make her or Sakura Shirou's lovers and that they were shoe horned in like that because eroge.</br>  <br> She was never trained at all, she was just abused. <br>This is pure bullshit.

I do it with utmost care. Every small detail is important to me, I look at every that needs to be done and I do it over and over again until I'm happy with the outcome. And then, when I hand the product over, I see another small detail that went unnoticed and tell myself I'll do it better next time.<br><br>I enjoy what I do, I suppose that's the secret.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have any projects you're working on or are you a free lancer?</br>  Great work! It was a great read can't wait for the next chapter.  <br><br>Started doing redraws with this very manga, you tell me.<br><br>The only reason I'm working on this is because HF is my favorite route.</br></br></br></br>  <br>domo</br>  <br> those expecting puppy eyes <br>too cute</br></br>  <br><br>Excellent. Another round of Count the Senpais. I'll go get the booze and see how long I last this episode.</br></br>  <br>Don't die.</br>  <br><br>There's only been 40 Senpais in the Manga so far. That's not enough to kill me. Now the movies, that's probably going to put me in Hospital. If I do die, I've left instructions for someone to notify /a/ and give my Obituary. 'It was worth it for best girl'.</br></br>  <br><br>And that was Six. So 46 Senpais in the HF Manga so far.<br><br>My eternal quest to destroy my liver continues...</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Are you people actually autist?</br></br></br></br>  What is our first fight scene? Saber vs Lancer, right?  <br>What's she thingken about?</br>  <br>Where do you think we are?</br>  <br>Smug-chan!</br>  Wait, did Shirou dream about Caliburn in HF?  <br>He gets visions of things from archer's arm.</br>  <br><br>They're really good</br></br>  <br>But he hasn't gotten Archer's arm yet.</br>  <br>Fixed.</br>  <br><br>She's a slut who pleases old men for money and young woman for the gay times.</br></br>  <br>Rin is pure.</br>  <br><br> Pure <br> Has an H-Scene in every route, including one where she fucks a girl and them masturbates to watching the other two fuck. <br><br>Pure my arse.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>1. The H scene in HF is actually Rider<br>2. The scene in Fate was just her graciously helping Shirou and Saber figure out that the ponis goes in the vagoo.</br></br>  <br> 1. The H scene in HF is actually Rider <br>Its actually pretty vague. Although it fits in with Rider's character's abilities, Rin can also use those spells, and Caster too.<br><br>Here's a question. Why would Rider impersonate Rin out of all the women? Couldn't she just do a lewd Sakura instead?<br>Its because Rider knew that only Rin was naughty enough to do that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirou has been wanting the dolphin from Rin for ages. It's only in HF where he learns to take Sakura's worm.</br>  <br><br>Or maybe it's because Rider has a bit of a thing for Rin.</br></br>  <br> Rider thinks of Rin when thinking of naughty things. <br>Anon, that's lewd.<br><br>Now I can only imagine Rider thinking of Rin like Castah does when Saber is concerned, getting excited when confronting each other.</br></br></br></br>  Maybe Rider just wanted to be Rin for a bit, because everyone wants to be best girl.  <br>So even Rider thinks Rin is the best girl? I don't know what to think of this, as I've decided to bet on Sakura instead.</br>  <br><br>Those two both dance around the fact they want to fuck each other like it's nobody's business.<br><br>If I recall, it's implied in one of the HF endings they are sleeping together.<br><br><br><br>If by best girl you mean 'girl I want to sleep with', then sure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dayum, these details. I'm really happy we got a good artist taking care of HF, can't wait for the good scenes.<br>He better give us ton of Riderservice.</br></br>  <br>  Young Taiga <br><br>B<br>A<br>S<br>E<br>D<br><br>I wonder if they'll add more content. Like references to Zero and Gil fighting inside the shadow before getting rekt.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She got just one H scene in her own route, less than Saber and and the purple one.</br>  <br> Rin can also use those spells, and Caster too. <br>She appeared with Rider's eyes at the end of that scene for fuck's sake, how is that vague?</br></br>  <br>Maybe Rin had an eye infection.</br>  <br> Rider's eyes. <br>There's more than one character in F S/N that share the same eye color.<br><br>You could even say that its actually Sakura, after using her shadow powers and taking the form of Rin.</br></br></br></br>  <br> There's more than one character in F S/N that share the same eye color. <br>Does Sakura have square irises?<br>Fuck off, retard.</br></br></br>  <br> Moving the goalposts <br>First you say color, and then square irises.<br>Holy shit can you make yourself more mad intentionally?<br> Square irises <br>How conclusive, not.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> le troll u mad XD <br>niceme.me</br></br>  Why Night of Fate when the studio itself uses Fateful Night?  <br>Get out. You're just shitting the thread. Why not actually read/play heaven's feel?<br>Its not as if Rider needed Shirou's mana at that point.</br></br>  <br> Why not actually read/play heaven's feel? <br>The irony.<br>Apply it to yourself, faggot.</br></br></br>  <br> Because you say her eyes are square? <br>Give me a break anon. And coincidentally, just because you're on track in Sakura's route, Rider automatically sexes Shirou for no reason?<br>That doesn't even make sense. It makes as much sense as the girl taking the form of Rin, just because.</br></br></br>  <br> Rider automatically sexes Shirou for no reason? <br>How many more times do I have to call you a retard until you get up your ass and read the shit?</br></br>  <br>Uwawawa. Fuck off.<br>Now you're implying it wasn't Rider after saying it was. You're so full of shit anon. I mean you're just shitposting now for the hell of it.</br></br>  <br>  If you care for someone you fucking tell them what's up <br><br>yeah, tell him that they're having a secret battle to death with heroes of ancient times and mages, that will probably make him safe.</br></br></br>  <br><br>fuck off, both of you</br></br>  <br>I want to hug this creature</br>  Why do girls ruin everything?  <br>Dicks indeed more attractive than vaginas, which look like the mouth of a monster. Why can't girls just have dicks?</br>  <br>She's pretty cute but I wouldn't have forgiven her that easily.</br>  『ＪＵＤＧＥＭＥＮＴ－ＤＡＹ』判定~   Still no Hibiki arc   <br>Eeeeh, vulva can be very cute and beautiful, and there are disgusting looking dicks as well. If you say a vagina looks like the mouth of a monster, you could say a dick looks like a snake or a club or sword or other weapon.<br><br>It all depends on the individual.</br></br></br>   Stupei     Best girl.  <br> The watergun looks like a penis </br>  Here's a better megaten with better girls.  <br>That glasses one is hella cute.</br>  Personally i'm loving this show already and it has the potential to become even better.
