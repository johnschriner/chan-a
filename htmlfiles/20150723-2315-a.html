[ Chapter 10 is out. I'll dumping it.<br><br>You always know where to read this.<br> http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/self-<wbr>r5634</wbr> </br></br></br>  I'm still surprised someone picked this up after so many years.                                            <br>Is this the girlfriend?<br>Looks really similar to her sister</br></br>  <br>So intense here. Didn't expect there'd be new girl soon, thanks for your work and the translator as well.</br>  <br>Yes, she's his girlfriend. Maybe the art just inconsistent.</br>  <br>Who is this new girl? Maybe I should search for the raw</br>  <br>Here if you want to download the raw :<br><br> http://dl-zip.com/%E3%82%BB%E3%83%A<wbr>B%E3%83%95/</wbr> </br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, trying to search in jcaf24 but the search term was so generic it didn't yield the thread.</br>  This struck a nerve with me, I felt like this for so long.  <br>I'm enjoying it. The new girt just start masturbating while talking.</br>  <br>Spoiler that shit, I'm trying to enjoy this onani adventure.</br>  <br>I was not spoiling anything though. I didn't even talk about  some one will teach him the way of masturbating </br>  <br>I kind of hope he dumps his girlfriend for the coworker</br>  <br>this girl is good but I like Uta-chan better.</br>  <br>Coworker's sort of annoying. Girlfriend seems pretty superficial, but unless there's some overdramatic NTR twist, she's nice enough that I don't want to see him just dump her unceremoniously.</br>  <br>reading volume 4,  it's going to happen  </br>  <br>is this about me?</br>  Fun read, thanks for this OP.<br>Reminded me of kyon's fap adventures. I'll dump it for old time's sake.</br>      <br>Has anyone ever tried this? I sort of want to but I don't know if I can cum from pure imagination any more.</br>  Gakkou Gurashi thread<br><br>Its all-time sales across all vols were 80,501 copies. It sold 119k just last week as the anime started.</br></br>  Yuuri a shit.  is animation just advertisement for manga and LN these days?  <br>mission accomplished.<br><br>sasuga production commitee.</br></br></br>  Well, the manga deserves it.<br><br>Anime, not so much.</br></br>  How long will it take for it to get serious or will it just stay as this SoL comedy with edgy moments at the end.

Given the combination of stock issues and digital options – it was dominating Amazon’s manga/LN rankings in its Kindle format – it missed the cutoffs.<br><br>But it seems reasonable to think it could have moved 10k a volume that weekend, if it moved 22-25k the following week. That would account for 50k of its 80k before 07/13-17/19. And that would mean its anime bump is even more ridiculous, percentage-wise, that it looks right now!<br><br>Basically of its 200k total sales at the moment, I’d bet maybe 170k of those came since episode 1 aired. At the very least I’d say about 150k, or 75%.<br><br>Prior total / Last week / New total<br>22,227 / 25,309 / 47,536 Vol 1<br>16,024 / 24,829 / 40,853 Vol 2<br>13,987 / 23,652 / 37,639 Vol 3<br>12,836 / 22,769 / 35,605 Vol 4<br>15,427 / 22,372 / 37,799 Vol 5<br><br>Great for Houbunsha!

But if they choose to animate it, there is a beach episode and a river episode if they somehow get that far</br>    <br> Anon doesn't think this is SoL </br>  <br>Basically<br>Besides, it's in the manga, I doubt they'd not at least give it a shot somehow</br></br>  The anime is kinda shit so far, but I love it because its existence means that the manga is getting the attention it deserves.  Yuki!  Japs love garbage.<br>Nothing new.</br>  <br>Goddamnit, why censor that when you could just remove the 10 pixels of it instead and improve the image?</br>  <br>That's a big bat.<br><br>This isn't garbage<br><br>It doesn't have to be high school genki healing to be SoL</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, doc</br>  <br> That's a big bat. <br> Nuclear. </br></br>    <br>Ok, now fuck off you dipshit, nobody cares about your get</br>  <br>I'll donate my organs to finding a better cure</br>      <br>can you not?</br>  <br>based on past records, I'd expected you in the Charlotte threads not here</br>  <br>Who's your favorite Gurashi, distorter anon?</br>  <br>Do them explain why is Yuki's uniform blue and the rest of the girls including zombies green?</br>  <br>Why does she wear no panties?</br>  <br>It's just an imposter.</br>  <br>Don't ask, just enjoy</br>  <br> Discover the only cure is fresh piping hot semen applied to the back of the throat <br> Shovel is getting the zombie shakes <br>Do you risk your organ?</br></br></br>  <br>You could restrain her and just fap into her mouth for the first load, and just make sure to be on time for the following doses</br>  <br>that would make her choke, should find out if anal works as well.</br>  <br>No, there's no time to restrain.

Why does she wear the garters?  <br>So her socks won't fall down?</br>  <br>because she's a junior</br>    <br>Because she is a whore who secretly whores herself out to zombies at night because she is a whore.</br>  YOU DO NOT FUCKING PUT THE MEAT SAUCE ON TOP<br><br>THIS IS NOT RIGHT!</br></br>  <br> Male MC <br>Your record-keeping is terrible<br><br><br><br>Mii-kun is best boy</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't?</br>  <br>Mii-kun is pure</br>  <br>What the fuck do you do?<br>Mix it up?<br>Eat it separately?<br>Really, I'm interested.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You do realize that anyone who has just a little bit of experience cooking knows that you're supposed to MIX THE FUCKING SAUCE JESUS CHRIST</br>  <br>You're supposed to mix the sauce?</br>  <br>W-why is Taroumaru looking right at me? It's scaring me</br>  <br><br>This is anon is right<br>Mixing it up is the only answer<br> Putting it on top is fine too </br></br></br></br>  <br>Not all people are born with determination. But that doesn't mean they are weak. The ones with the power must show them the way.<br><br>It's hope.</br></br></br>  <br>This is just foreshadowing Yuuri's PTSD</br>  <br>oh that's your criteria. I was basing it on P.A Works and Kyoani</br>  <br>No I meant in the sense of ability to cum quickly<br>I don't think that will be a problem as long as you don't actively try the opposite, especially with your dick in shovel's mouth</br></br>  <br>he knows you knows</br>  <br><br>My taste just seems to be completely out of touch with what's popular these days. I found ep 1 of this show to be incredibly boring. I mean, they spent half the time talking about nothing and looking for a dog. I'm going to assume it's selling like this solely because of the cute girls.</br></br>  <br>You probably aren't wrong.</br>    <br><br>It'll be fine, they did a great job with ass class.</br></br>    <br>CANTWAKEUP.jpg</br>  <br>Did you not finish the episode?</br>  <br>Did you not watch till the end?</br>  <br>I'm going to have nightmares tonight.</br>  <br>He's wrong!</br>  <br><br>I did. It's just the build up to that point wasn't interesting. This is going to be jarring if the whole show is from pink hair's perspective.</br></br>    <br>You're ignoring Kinmoza and Wakaba Girls</br>  <br>needs some work but I like where this is going</br>    tfw Rii will never go full yandere on you  <br>It isn't, most of the series is from everyone else's perspective.</br>  <br>Well, it's not.</br>  <br>You must have completely missed the point<br><br>The show is supposed to appear as generic moe cute girls doing nothing SOL, but the twist at the end is what made it interesting<br><br>It's supposed to feel generic.</br></br></br></br></br>  I picked up the first episode of this garbage, dropped it halfway through.<br><br>Stupid bitch barging into classes should get expelled</br></br>  <br>the fuck is this shit?</br>  <br>saved<br><br>this better be b8</br></br></br>  <br>Are you sure?<br><br><br>Well this is a SoL so I'm not sure what else you were expecting. And it's not always from her perspective at least in the Manga anyways.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't tell if retarded or bait</br>  so, what those manga title means? is that some foreshadowing?  <br>Post the non-red version.</br>    <br>Truly the stuff of nightmares</br>  <br>I think it's trying to represent how the infected see the world.</br>  <br><br>Hurr durr. Please, go on and explain to me how a show about an autistic little shit disrupting the school lives of her classmates is supposed to be endearing</br></br>  <br>I've never been more certain of anything in my entire life. Miki is pure</br>  <br> Zombie Warning <br> Dead or Undead <br> Studio Gurashi! <br><br>Nope. No foreshadowing or anything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>in case you're not b8ing: finish the episode you fucking retard</br>  <br>It's bait, just ignore.</br>  <br>you never know on /a/ but you're probably right</br>  <br>Not really foreshadowing then, since we already know there are zombies</br>  OTP and you know it.    <br><br>Personally I mix it, but almost everyone puts it on top. Rii is probably following a recipe she saw somewhere.</br></br>  <br>Why do you keep adding beards to things?</br>  <br>Most likely the one on the back of the bag</br>  <br> beards <br>Are you underage?</br></br>  <br><br> Just because </br></br>  <br>what's the title of the black one? Zombie warning?</br>  <br>A pure slut.</br>  Knowing Shovel Ayaya is gonna die is even worse than her dying.  <br> Its all-time sales across all vols were 80,501 copies.  <br>I'm more impressed at how it survived that long selling that little.</br></br>  <br> beards </br>  <br> Rii-san looking at you seductively <br> Kurumi looking at you with surprise </br></br>  <br> these days <br>You're the slowpoke-est person on /a/ I've ever met.</br></br>  <br>Sluts. Yuki and Miki seem fine though</br>  <br> surprise <br>More like a<br> Oh, you came already? <br>Face</br></br></br></br>   Read the manga to hype myself for the anime <br> Can't enjoy the first episode because of the inconsistencies with the manga </br>  <br>I blame Rii-san for that</br>  <br>I read the manga after the first episode and actually preferred the anime reveal over the manga reveal.</br>  <br>Yeah, the anime did that a lot better. Still don't like how they added the dog and Miki though.</br>  <br>The anime dropping all those little hints that something was wrong was nice, but I couldn't get over Miki and Taroumaru somehow being involved. Plus they got rid of the water fight.</br>      <br>Maybe I'm missing something, but why was this even taken to mean she liked the guy?</br>  <br>She won't die though.  R-right? </br>  <br>Maybe one of the other Ayayas could take over if and when that happens.</br>  <br>No, that's the first one, the black one is The Six Sensei(?)<br><br>Didn't seem to fit...

Not until after there's some more Uni conflict though, those guys were willing to shoot uninfected humans on sight to avoid infected ones.</br></br></br>  <br> It's not, he's just either retarded or trolling. There's a high chance he doesn't interact with any girls ever too. </br>  <br>It's referring to Sixth Sense you dense motherfucker.</br>  <br>Fuck me. I'm a retard.</br>  <br>sixth sense(?).<br>Is that "i" in the end or something else?<br>maybe. it's related to Yuki delusion which actually her sixth sense.</br></br></br>  <br>There are alive guys in this?<br><br>So people said it was all-girl walking dead story were lying to me.</br></br></br>  <br>All those guys are dead Jim.</br>  <br>All men die within 3 pages or are already dead.</br>  <br>That's a flashback. They're all dead now.</br>  <br>Sometimes I wonder if I should stop being such a weeb and branch out more and watch actual movies and read real books and stuff.</br>  <br>Crossbow-kun hasn't died yet and neither have bandit-san #1 or #2</br>  <br>I know this guy is being mean on purpose, but is all this about the sales true?</br>  <br>The school is 4 girls. The guys were survivors from the mall until that black haired guy hid his bite in that top panel. Miki was with them and escaped with her girlfriend until her girlfriend went back for burnt zombie dick.</br>  <br>I'm hoping her zombieness will go up to the point where the other zombies will ignore her even when she's shouting and she'll end up having an existential crisis/healing phase and no further than that. Then she can go back to being an action bastard.  Please. </br>  <br><br> Thanks for the kek anon heh </br></br>  <br> Crossbow is hopefully a tomboy </br>  <br>I doubt she'll get any deeper than this, they pay attention to noise regardless of what makes it.</br>  <br>Is Miki a tomboy?</br>  so what's the most plausible explanation for no guys in this series?  <br>Yeah, this series is going to flop hard anime-sales wise at this rate. Not even Hanayamata was doing that bad.</br>  <br>Well we don't know how long the serum actually lasts, just that it conveniently ran out when Chopper-kun was going to rescue the girls. She could last for a long time, or maybe burn through their supply quickly.  She's dead Jim. <br><br><br>Not moe enough to live.</br></br></br></br>    <br>It's a CGDCT. Simple as that.</br>  <br>They tried to be heroes.</br>  <br>How do we save it?</br>  <br>We get all our friends  :^)  to buy it.</br>  <br>Author isn't comfortable drawing male faces</br>  <br>The anime isn't out yet, preorders are meaningless, ignore preorderfags.</br>  <br>We don't, we just watch it burn.</br>  <br>It's pretty clearly a boy from the different angles. Same with the guys in helmets. The author is framing it as boys vs girls.<br><br>Randall probably has a bunch of guys</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I'll laugh hard when it sells less than 4k</br>  <br><br>Those numbers doesn't add properly.<br><br>So did it sell like 80k or 36k?<br><br>and did it sell like 44k or 119k?<br><br>make sense faggots.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>girls are more immune to the infection</br>  Kurumi a best  <br>especially the cute ones</br>  <br>The potency of the drugs the girls have might be different so it lasts longer.  The school was part of the group working on the virus wasn't it?   Please no. </br>  I want to hug Miki and hold her hands and tell her everything will be diejoubu  <br><br>You did that anon?<br> If so, really noice </br></br></br>  <br>No, the school was just built with the shelter in mind. Remember that Randall is right there, they seem to have set up shelters in the city just in case.</br>    <br>Shit yeah. Hmm the serum should be an older version though since they probably have been working on that so they might have different side effects.

The dog is there so we care when it dies. Some more SoL padding was added for obvious reasons.

Were they an extra in the manga?</br>  <br>you can find extras here<br/></br>  <br>So how hard will the massive new anime audience flip out if we make it to the bear?</br>  <br>Doubt the anime'll get that far, but when the anime gets to pic related and the Graduation, it will be the most healing thing since the end of YuYuYu.</br>  Sorry fpr being an enormous newfag (I usually don't post, only lurk), but do all manga adaptation threads always filled with so many spoilers all the time?  <br><br>Not gonna happen (maybe)<br>My guess is that the anime is going to end with the graduation<br><br> But at least the manga got a giant sales boost </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If it has translations and isnt 100+ chapters long then yes.</br>    <br>Even if the anime doesn't sell well, the mangaka's getting money either way.</br>  <br><br>Most of them, yes. You even get stuff like  which is a novel and has spoilers in the op.</br></br>      <br>Yes. Even if the source is such an obscure novel nobody has read it, you'll get rough guesses based on google translated snippets and 2ch posts.</br>  <br>Yuubutt is smaller and cuter, but Riibutt is fertile and plump.</br>  What happened to Yuki?  <br>Bullying, and lots of it<br> Screw you, I still prefer this to be the case </br></br>  <br><br> Shes a zombie </br></br>  <br>Do you have a non-mustachioed version of this please?</br>  <br>Check the archives</br>  <br><br>No need, I will be nice to anon</br></br>      <br>Menstruation.</br>  <br>Add Megane</br>  <br>Megu-nee is pure too!<br>Also Kei. And Radio.</br></br>  <br> megu and radio <br> implying those dried up sluts are pure </br></br>  <br>What about the bear?</br>  <br>Megu-nee is a sweet Christmas cake, and you will not sully her good name.</br>  <br>She's most likely had more dicks in her than a men's restroom</br>  <br>Why must you bring your lewd talk to this thread?<br>Maybe you're the one who wants dicks.</br></br>    <br>you forgot Kurumi</br>  Anyone else hate how convenient everything is in the manga. All tension is loss now since everything needed comes in the nick of time or has been there already as part of the setting.<br>As far as I can tell the only real bad thing that happened in the manga was megu-nee.</br>  <br>You're right, the cannibals are really convenient, and so was Rii's brain snapping like a twig at a time where the crew could really need her to be level headed</br>  <br> Kurumi is gonna die. <br>They didn't come in the nick of time for radio-chan.</br></br>  <br>I'm really wondering how you can think that. The only real convenient thing I can think of is Yuki heaing Miki and the two of them managing to not get infected. Everything else works against them.</br>  Why does everyone think uni girls are cannibals? Is it just a random theory or were there hints I missed. I mean it's obvious something is off with them, by why cannibalism?  <br>Rii's losing it, Kurumi is walking a slow path to death, and they're out in relative danger. There is no hope for them.</br>  <br>I don't necessarily agree, but when I was reading two different series I got a similar feeling. I think that once you stick with these types of stories for a while things just start to seem silly and predictable.</br>  <br> rescue helicopter crashes and destroys the school with fire <br> convenient <br>I'd hate to see what your idea of inconvenient would look like.</br></br></br>  <br>So you want more cute girl suffering? You bastard</br>  <br><br><br>Sure they are put bad situations because of the setting but they are saved by it even more. They are at a school in the beginning that conveniently has electricity, running water, and a farm plot and 4 girls with absolutely no preparation and one being useless in combat were somehow able to survive this world. On top of that there seems to be a pattern of "terror of the week" chapters and story arcs where they get stuck in a poor situation and then come unscathed in the last second. Characters that experience a mental lockdown in the worst time get saved/recover right before they get killed. Characters get stuck with zombies and someone or something distracts them and they escape. I just can't really see 4 girls getting through this relatively fine physically even though only one of them trained athletically. It just seems like poor story telling to me.<br>Or alternatively I'm just retarded for thinking a show that is also a moe SoL would also be realistic to the zombie drama and like  says I just want them to suffer more.</br></br></br></br>  so was this outbreak airborne? <br><br>how did being on a rooftop protect them?</br></br>  <br>It's storytelling in itself to have the "terror of the week" be the focus of the chapter. If we looked into completely random points into their lives, it would be boring.</br>  <br> yfw this is like The Truman Show </br>   oh look a nice cute SoL show <br> let's watch it <br> wow this is pretty boring and weird, this bitch is mega autistic <br> reach last 2 minutes or so of first episode <br>what the fuck?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It protected them from zombie attacks, the outbreak had already spread by then. If they hadn't gotten the alpha strain by then they weren't going to.<br><br>Yes it's "convenient" but so what? If these things weren't "convenient" either the story would have ended very quickly or it wouldn't be SoL, and being an SoL zombie story is the entire point of Gakkou Gurashi. Other than their initial setup at the school I wouldn't call anything else that's happened convenient.</br></br></br>  <br>I can agree that they had come out of some situations rather conveniently even if the reasons are in the setting itself. Then again, look at what we have now. Yuki pretending to be delusional, Rii losing it, Kurumi being half-dead. Now they are with suspicious uni girls. I don't think this would end well.</br>  <br>Welcome. Here is your one warning.<br>If you don't want to get spoiled, get out.</br></br>  <br> conveniently <br>This is one of the few areas set up by Randall with equipment to survive when this breakout would happen. You're literally complaining that the people given the tools to survive manage to use those tools.<br><br> terror of the week <br>No such thing.<br><br> come unscathed in the last second <br>Honestly don't know a situation this would refer to. There isn't a huge luck game like you're pretending.<br><br> mental lockdown recover right before they get killed <br>No. Yuki was broken up until after everything was better, she was only allowed to suffer once things were looking better. She has had a few moments of supposed clarity but nothing has ever come from them; if anything, they've harmed the people involved like chasing after Miki.<br><br> something distracts them <br>The characters run around with coins and glowsticks and whatever for that purpose exactly. That's how they survive.<br><br>You don't have to find it believable but at least acknowledge that the story has a premise that supports everything that has happened so far.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>better question is how the fuck did zombies manage to overpower humans? They skip over this fact in a lot of zombie media, but if you have zombies that are so weak that a kid with a shovel can take them out with relative ease and they are so slow moving and fragile, how do enough people actually manage to get bitten? These zombies seem so weak that I can probably beat at least half a dozen in unarmed combat, especially if its only bites that transfer the virus</br>  <br>They're in Yokohama, which is right next to Tokyo, the city basically agreed to be the worst place ever for a zombie outbreak to occur.</br>  <br>Panic, mass confusion, hysteria, denial, idiots, take your pick.</br>  <br>Numbers</br>  <br>There were lots of them, people were panicked, and the infection spreads incredibly easily,</br>  <br>See the Mall chapter and how everything happened there. That can pretty much be applied to every place in Japan except the countryside and military bases. And it's not like it started with just 1 infected person.</br>  <br>no, animation is for charity and no one is payed to make anime</br>  <br> realistic zombie drama <br>Anon plis.</br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>The ant mind controlling fungus the alpha strain is probably based on releases spores after it kills an ant, which would be concentrated at ground level or near the host ("airborne" for an ilness is really just a transmission distance power level, not true flying). We don't know how this would work with zombies, but one possibility is the longer human lifespan greatly slows the omega strain's life cycle, so it'll be years before the next wave of spores.<br><br><br>My theory is some lab worker took it on a plane trip through Tokyo's biggest airport during the airborne infection phase, and people infected by that spread it throughout all the world's airports. It proceeded to spread like the flu, which doesn't get everyone at once, but does get everywhere. The infected all turned into zombies on the same day. The airborne phase ended then, but there were already enough infected to take all major cities down.</br></br></br></br>  So I just read until the latest scanlated chapter, am I allowed to post in these threads now?  <br>Did you read ch 36 and 37?</br>  <br>Re-read it so you didn't miss anything<br>Seriously</br></br>  <br>Only if you agree left is the best of the three sluts.</br>  <br>No I did not, I'll be right back.</br>  <br>Made a couple minor alterations</br>    http://www.examu.co.jp/nitroplus_bl<wbr>asterz/character/partner18.html</wbr>  I hope beargirl makes that buttface in the anime too  <br>She won't be in the anime</br>  <br>We have the dog. Who's to say they won't find her on the field trip?</br>  <br>The dog predates the start of the manga, and Miki is the only reason the viewers needed the mall for. That volume is getting cut out entirely.<br>Not to mention she only shows up once Rii is broken and that doesn't happen until once they've left school.</br></br>  <br>so how will the anime end then? With them leaving the school? They are going to fit in some excessive filler then, because that's too little content for 13 episodes.</br>  <br>No, they're pretty clearly getting a mall flashback. That's why it was referenced so clearly.</br>  <br>Be honest<br><br>You're a sloth, aren't you?</br></br></br>  <br>Why is it too little?<br> Miki flashback <br> Obligatory dog dies episode <br> Kurumi bite <br> Megu-nee flashbacks <br> Helicopter crash and aftermath <br> Graduation <br><br>Should fit into 10 episodes pretty well, at the pace they're going.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's plenty of content.<br><br>Flashback, yes. Field trip is overkill when we already have Miki, I guess I forgot that flashback bit is still in volume 2.</br></br></br>    Guys help, I can't stop listening to the OP  <br>You have fine taste.</br>  <br>did we have 1st floor and basement map?</br>  <br>I swore she had huge breasts from the thumbnail.</br>  <br>What, he didn't do one for episode 2?<br><br>Also the artist should just hurry up and give us a completely unobstructed and detailed view of shovel's armpit already.</br></br></br>  <br>I wish to emulate this artist's style. It's just so cute</br>  Do Gurashis have periods?  <br>yes</br>  <br>He did something for Cinderella Girls' return last week.</br>    <br> 80,000 copies <br>Assuming the mangaka makes 100 yen a tank which is pretty generous, how the fuck is he making enough to live?</br></br>  <br>I can sing the entire lyrics by memory now. It's good</br>  I can't wait for the new chapter, hopefully there will be raws fast.  Why doesn't Ruu talk?<br>Is she mute?</br>  <br>Maybe her throat hurts.</br>  <br>doing other job</br>     Why was Daft Punk chasing the Gurashis?<br/> <br> Common thugs? <br> Working with the uni girls to lure them in?   <br>Working against uni girls and wants to warn them?</br> </br></br>  <br>Better question. Which Gurashi do you think has the biggest bush?</br>  <br>Probably the latter.</br>  <br>They're all 2D ideals so none.</br>  <br>They want Rii for stress relief and breeding purposes.</br>  <br>But bushes are the ideal.</br>   Kurumifags   <br>I don't know what website that is but I think you should probably stay there.</br>  <br>This</br>  I'm probably making a big deal out of nothing, but I'll say it anyway. I know I make various posts involving other girls from anime, particularly the twintailed ones. Let me make something clear. Very few of those posts are ever serious. My latest one about Kurumi showing up in a dream was my attempt at being funny, though it would have been better if I'd used a XD at the end. I will admit that I do adore the rest of my angel troupe, and I will without a doubt be adding Kurumi to my favorites folder, maybe even replacing one of the current members of my angel troupe, depending on her performance in Gakkou Gurashi!. I do believe that some responses I get from posts like that, particularly when I use certain words, are jokes. But for those that are serious, I'm saying this once. Do not EVER question my dedication to Azusa. She is my number one, and always will be. No matter how many times I appear to show affection to other characters, at most it's only a bit. My heart and soul is with Azusa. Again, I'm no doubt making a big deal out of this, but I just wanted to make this clear. That one comment I got hit me quite hard.<br><br><br>No matter how many times I read it, I still cant seem to fully understand exactly what the fuck I'm actually reading.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The fuck did I just read?</br></br>  <br>I had to type  out to try and help process what I was reading.<br><br>Here's hoping that's the last time we ever have to read that</br></br></br>  <br><br>Wait, it's him isn't it?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128463065 <br>Don't do this.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128463065 <br> *Gulp* </br>  <br>Do what? *Gulp*</br>  Is there anything to like about Rii-san other than her body?  <br>I like her mental breakdown.</br>  <br>I was hoping he'd killed himself.</br>  <br>Not sure if he did or not, I'm curious myself. I would if I said something so autistic</br>  <br><br>I like her love for stuffed animals.</br></br>  REMOVE DOG  <br>She's gentle and responsible, acts mature (no, having a breakdown doesn't stop this) and is complete wife material.</br>  <br>Dong and Miikun.</br>  <br>Yes but there are no tampons in the post apocolyptic world so they all freebleed.</br>  <br>They just shove some text book paper up there.</br>  <br>is this how ppl see when they are in lsd holy sht</br>  <br> Its all-time sales across all vols were 80,501 copies.

GG is both of their only ongoing work according to mangaupdates.</br></br>  <br>It's up to you to heat it back up.</br>  <br>Can't speak for the artist, but the author is a Nitroplus writer who works on VNs, co-writes a fair bit of Urobuchi anime and such.</br>  <br>I've got just the thing.</br>  <br> i really want her to survive <br>Zombie stories either end with all-survival or team wipe.<br>The author obviously can't tell us which, it would kill the tension.<br><br>But it is clear that he is deliberately balancing despair with hope, because everytime something bad happens there is usually something good that keeps the team from falling apart. The show needed light at the end of the tunnel or the plot would simply end. The story just can't work without the gap moe of happy girls surrounded by a living hellscape.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mangaupdates doesn't list all of the works, wikipedia is much better at it.<br><br>I can say for sure that both of them have worked on novels/novellizations.<br>Kaihou Norimitsu is also doing translations and worked on some anime/games (he has also written the story mode/Drama CDs/novels for almost all of the Guilty Gear games before the Xrd).<br>Chiba Sadoru is drawing some doujins/working on Imas Cinderella 4coma manga/drawing art for the social games. He has also illustrated several novels by Akira/日日日 and one of them got a manga adaptation (Heian Zankoku Monogatari) where a different illustrator is adapting his designs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does the school store stock sex toys?

Also, as this anon rightfully points out , she just shits anywhere and can't clean herself.</br>  <br>That Anon is probably a nigger, hence he likes the resemblance.</br>  <br> tfw terrified of snakes but Miia is best girl </br>  <br> Just imagine that bellow her waist, she is just like a horse. <br> Who would want an waifu that has a disgusting pussy like a horse? Yuck. <br>You're asking for it, aren't you?<br><br>You're right though, Miia is better</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I know what you mean. Despite hating snakes, I think Miia is still cute. But I couldn't have sex with her, and I can't even begin to fathom how something like this  would be nice.</br>   And Papi's ass is literally so perfect that not only does shit not come out of it, if any did, it wouldn't stick to her ass for fear of tarnishing it <br><br>I like the way you think</br></br>  <br><br>Check it<br><br><br>I know that feel. I'm not afraid of snakes and Miia is best girl, but a Rachnee is fine too and I hate spiders.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is true. Papi does have the best body by far, but her legs are gross. Her wings/arms are fine, though.</br>  <br>Snakes are fucking cute, especially pythonidae.</br>  <br> she can't even wipe her ass. <br><br>She uses an augbesian.</br></br></br>  Yo fa/tg/uy here. its really the /d/eviant overlap that gets us.<br>Its why where sometimes called /d/evian/tg/entlemen. It just hits our fancy in just the right spot. <br>To be honest, im not entirely sure why monster musume gets our board all riled up, but it does and it makes sense for a board whos activities include roleplaying as various other creatures in fantasy and scifi settings. I mean, jesus have you ever been to one of our weekend smut threads? It gets pretty lewd in there, way more than monster musume for sure.<br>Pic Related, we take what is /a/ and make it more /tg/ for our liking and fapping.</br></br></br>  ITT: Animeonlyfags  <br>It's face is terrifying.</br>  <br>It depends on if shes willing to start slow with some of the snake type stuff.</br>  I don't remember her name, but I think this is best girl  <br> No board is safe from filthy secondaries <br>This is hell.</br></br>  <br>I want have back the old MonMusu threads.</br>  <br> not having a pet bushmaster to cuddle with </br>  <br>but is the same face of a dog puppy<br> Still Rachnee is best girl and should win the darlingbowl </br></br>  <br> harem shit <br> poor's man MGQ <br> Bad desings <br>don't know OP.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying you have to worry about best girl getting dirty </br>    <br>Snakes in the wild are scary. Pet snakes are fine.<br>But I don't care how much you try to tell me your pet spider is harmless, I'm not going within a hundred feet of that thing.</br></br>  <br>I enjoy how in the manga she just becomes an asshole when she is poisoned</br>  <br>This is hell.</br>  <br>Is that..? No, it couldn't be...</br>  <br> poor mans MGQ <br> implying MGQ isn't the poor man's MGE <br> thinking the MGQ and MM are anything alike besides the fact there are monstergirls in them <br> being this retarded and new <br><br>Enjoy your vore faggot</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would go check that but it's probably agro x wander.</br>  <br>I prefer my girls with a little more meat on their bones.</br>  <br> this vanilla pleb <br>no wonder why this and shimoneta are the normalbait of the season.</br></br>  <br>Son of a bitch.<br><br>You win, internet. You finally beat me.</br></br></br>  <br><br>heh.</br></br>  <br>Why would anyone ever want a snake as a pet? I've never understood this.</br>  <br>How does Miia shit? Where is a snake's anus?</br>  <br>She has a regular human butt.</br>  <br> not wanting to fuck that slutty mare </br>  <br>Just google, "how does a snake shit"</br>  <br>thats why you gotta get snake cause she got that human puss puss</br>  <br>I have seen this image posted twice on this board, and that is 3 times too many.</br>  <br/>  <br> Who would want an waifu that has a disgusting pussy like a horse? Yuck.  <br>This made me lol for some reason.</br></br>  <br>So she has to face the toilet to pee, then turn her whole body to poop? That doesn't seem very efficient. What if she had to go really badly and a bit slipped out while she was still peeing?</br>  <br><br><br>I thought that at first and normally I don't like it when anime characters have unrealistically large breasts.<br><br>Then I thought that since she is a centaur she is probably the only character I can think of where it actually makes sense for her to have giant cowtits.</br></br></br></br></br>  a horse could easily stomp on whores  <br>Wow, I've never thought of that.</br>  <br>How the fuck do they breast feed?</br>  <br>The harpy is probably the best choice so far.<br>The slime girl has promise as well.</br></br>  <br> How does Miia shit? <br>Only Miia knows.</br></br>  <br>A would actually make more sense. Back side is just for excrement, front side is just for lovin'.</br>  <br>You're fear is not unfounded. Supposedly, human's have a instinctual tension around snakes. Apparently, humans have been bitten by snakes so much we supposedly developed a predisposition to being wary of snakes. Of course, this doesn't apply to everyone.</br>  <br>Don't forget the mouth grabbers of doom inside of there</br>  Honestly, I think why I like Centorea the best out of all the girls is because of her personality.<br><br> I'm not a tit man, not a furry, but for some reason I'm drawn to her. Her cute mannerisms, the way she talks, she's perfect.</br></br>  <br>snakes have cloaca so B</br>  <br>You don't need to e a furry to be a horse fucker</br>  <br>Snakes don't have tits.</br>  <br> cloaca <br>Oh god why are snakes so fucking disgusting.</br></br>  <br>At the very least a redneck farmer.</br>  <br/>  <br>Let's just say she is very good at flipping over when the time comes</br>  <br>When the baby centaurs are young I would imagine the mother could simply lie down.</br>  <br>That's eels</br>  <br/>    <br>Centorea is a good girl with a beautiful face and a good personality, but I can't get over the horse pussy.</br>  <br>I saw somewhere in the old animal planet that all non poison type ekans have two sets of teeth in the top of their mouths that pull back on prey</br>  <br>Shouldn't it be coming from the end of the tail then or closer to it instead of near her head?</br>    <br>isn't it like that fat guy who brings spoons wrapped in paper towels around cause he can't reach his own asshole?</br>   mfw this thread     <br>You are absolutely right OP, Centorea is the worst.</br>  <br> personality </br>  <br>I would imagine with centaurs either the horse part would be much smaller and weaker than a newborn horse or the human part would come out looking more like lolis.</br>  <br>Fucking Rachnee!!!</br>  <br>Being borne a loli...<br>That would be painful for the mother and child<br><br>But then being borne weak would make it more of a hazard if you are going to carry a child that will get pretty big before he can walk</br></br></br></br>  Why is it always Cerea and Miia in every thread? I think the poop habits of the other girls are equally important!<br><br>Birds traditionally have a cloaca, but Papi clearly has a butt and a vajayjay. Does she have runny bird poop, or does she defecate like a human?<br><br>If Suu dissolves everything she eats, and then leaves a trail of slime on the ground where ever she goes, could that slime trail be considered her poop?<br><br>Mero has the same issue Miia does, but fish don't have cloaca. Does she excrete through her gills, as many fish do?<br><br>What about Racnee? She has a butt at the bottom of the human part of her body. Does she have to flip over onto her back just to use the restroom?<br><br>If Lala's head eats something while disconnected from her body, does her body poop it out?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mero has the same issue Miia does, but fish don't have cloaca. Does she excrete through her gills, as many fish do? <br>Jesus Christ. So not only does Mero have cold, clammy skin that's covered in a layer of smelly fish slime but she is also frequently covered in her own shit.</br></br>  <br>This is a thought provoking post, Anon.</br>  <br>the dullahan one always concerned me</br>  <br>There needs to be a One Piece cross over so Luffy can ask the hard question.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PYz<wbr>n2JoEWeY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Nah sanji will cuck it up</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure anything Lala ate as just her head would fall through her neck hole.</br>  <br>I'd imagine that if her head eats while not on her body, it would just come out the bottom of her neck and not be digested. The only way for her to ingest food is too spoon it into the top of her esophagus.</br>  <br>She doesn't HAVE to wipe her ass.<br>The horse anus is a wonder of engineering and is auto cleaning.<br>Someone post the screencap.<br><br>There was a thread about that yesterday, look in the archive.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> plop </br>  <br> I don't know man, maybe I'm just waifu fagging hard for Centorea, but when you really love someone, you accept all that person has.<br><br> I'm no fan of horse pussy, but I think I'd be able to look past that for my centaur waifu.</br></br></br>   Zoophilia is just disgusting. <br><br>Hey.

I don't think any man would ever sign for that.</br>   tfw your waifu isn't real <br><br>I don't like this feeling, not one bit.</br></br>  <br>I don't think we should bring individual preferences into the debate.

I mean I know they are popular, but isn't BNHA more popular than Bleach right now in Japan. I mean why doesn't someone scan the whole magazine so we get everything at once. There is probably a good explanation but I don't know what it is. Naruto gaiden scans were coming out like 3 days before we wouldn't even get a BNHA spoiler. And the gaiden would be translated like five days before we got a translation for this series.</br>  <br> 3 days before we wouldn't even get a BNHA spoiler. And the gaiden would be translated like five days before we got a translation for this series. <br>Just lies.<br>We pretty much always got scans within 24 hours and china bro gives us a translation within that time frame too.<br>FA usually had their thing out within 48 hours, sometimes they went a little over but the longest i noticed was 3 days</br></br></br></br>  <br> but isn't BNHA more popular than Bleach right now in Japan <br>No. Just no.<br>BnHA is just well accepted, it isn't that much popular. You can't use ToCs alone to determine which series are popular.</br></br></br>    Awaiting scans.  <br>Bleach? Nah, but series like World Trigger yeah. Hero is hot sht and doesnt even have an anime out yet</br>  <br> no Ochako but we get tsuyu <br>Why is this allowed?</br></br>  <br>Put the name of the manga in the name so that it's easier to find in the catalog. <br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128458284 <br>Nice meme.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't actually be surprised if after the anime is made it does start selling more than bleach.<br>Silver Spoon is doing better than bleach, it's not really much of a accomplishment.<br>Silver Spoon is great though.</br></br></br>  <br>It's really not that bad. We get jap spoilers about the same time as other Jump series, and chinkscans one day after the big three. It's mainly Ishuhui that's the bottleneck in the process. <br><br> But no seriously when can we at least expect a spoiler <br>We get reliable spoilers on Thrusdays. Google "僕のヒーロー アカデミア 52" and limit to last 24 hours. <br><br>Generally, the trustworthy spoilers come from one of the below:<br>jump-netabare.seesaa.ne<br>jumpsokuhou.com<br>myheroacademia.seesaa.net</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Tsuyu looks good when she's not dressed like a quaker.</br></br>  <br>Boku no Hero Academia will probably do really great when when anime happens but it won't sell as much as Bleach did during its prime. You also forget Bleach also has Worldwide appeal.</br>  <br>The reliable spoilers come up on Thursday followed by Chinese scans. Understand? Now stop trying to make BNHA general threads a thing.</br>  <br>That's not even true though. We've almost always gotten spoilers Wednesday afternoon.</br>  <br> Why is this allowed? <br>All girls are best girls just enjoy the nice cover art next one's gonna be an all girl cover.</br></br>  <br> You also forget Bleach also has Worldwide appeal <br> implying superheroes don't have worldwide appeal <br>ReallyNigga.tiff</br></br></br>  <br>are frogs meant to be this sensual?</br>  <br>Well Boku no Hero Academia lacks that wow moment most Battle Shonen have.

Which is strange, because she's probably one of the top 3 girls that get shown the most, even if it's for running gags with that grapeshit</br></br></br>  <br>She gets a lot of paneltime because her blunt as fuck personality makes her a perfect straight man, not even just for grapes but in general</br>  <br> lies to try to make his favorite girl look better <br>Nice try, retard.</br></br>  <br>And has not fleshed her out because he has too many ideas, it's jusst because he's been doing other parts of the story that don't require her.

THERE IS A GOD.</br>  Is all might really first? because if that's true and we continue In that order then doesn't it mean that the nips taste is even more shit?

I have brain damage.</br>  <br><br>The author said on his twitter he always wanted a frog character in his stories as soon as her popularity boomed he was surprised since he thought he was gonna be the only one to like her. A few months ago he said something along the lines of "I'm gonna have to rethink some of the main cast members in the future." Code for fan and editor pressure want more frog.

They managed to make a punch feel real and enjoyable.  this time with feeling </br></br>  <br>Woaw there pal. I think you're mixing up annoying and cute. Nao is perfection in a bottle, and the title of cuteness comes with it.</br>  <br>I kind of expected her to be more stoic and have a different voice judging from the first promo image. I'm still not used to her character.</br>  Now, I don't usually post pictures, but Nao I have to.  <br>It's ok /a/non, perfection is still perfection no matter who looks at it.</br>  <br>Is something supposed to happen?</br>  <br>But she is stoic /a/non, she is...</br>  For use when needed.  So when is she going to go invisible whenever not Lelouch embarasses her when she inevitably goes dere?   that part of the OP where the singing gets slightly surreal and Nao is wagging her finger <br>2cute4me<br>Anyone have a gif/webm of that?</br></br>  <br>That's not even a punch, he just backhanded her, haha. Nigger what the heck.</br>  <br>As for the part of the song there is this https://<span>youtu.be/TcEbnFTY4R8  [ ]</br>  <br>Wish it was looped better but beggars can't be choosers. Thanks, /a/non.</br>  <br>Here's a gif for your troubles.</br>  Nao is cute. Im going to marry Nao.  <br>A gif with a shitty loop</br>  <br> Implying Nao would ever go out with someone like you </br>   tfw you will never have delinquent Nao as a gf <br> tfw you will never be roughly persuaded to have sex with her <br> tfw you will never be involuntarily involved in her delinquent mischief </br></br>  <br>I'll take him after he gets rejected.</br>  <br>Nao this is a story I could get behind.</br>  <br> Implying you have a chance with her </br>  <br>Why is she such a bitch?</br>  <br>Getting rejected by Nao is no reason to hate her.</br>  Sorry /a/, but buying this is the closest you will ever get to being with Nao.  <br>But what did she do with those photos of herself?</br>  I wonder when the ESL guy is gonna appear.  <br>Gave them to me</br>  Well you know Maeda will try to make you cry so Nao is definitely getting the Keyaids.  <br>Don't say such things. Nao is perfect and won't die, making happy little babies with Yuu.</br>  <br>Maeda has not killed a main heroine since Air, Nao will be fine.</br>  Please guys, Nao more bullying.    When will the MC NTR Nao with Yusa?  <br>Nao is pure. She would never do that.</br>  I want to ____ Nao    <br>is that charlotte?</br>    Sides of perfection    Gotta feed Nao  <br>Apples look perfect in Nao's hand.</br>  God I fucking hate Nao so much. What an inconsistent cunt of a character. Only redeeming part about this show is speedbro.  <br>I wish I was that apple.</br>  <br> Her character is too human like and doesn't fit into one stereotypical set. Waaaaaaaa! My animu. </br>  <br>Don't worry /a/non, Nao still accepts you. Have some cow tongue.</br>  <br>I'm mad at her because she is a cunt anon. Not because she isn't some generic tsundere or moeblob.</br>  <br> bawww the heroine has a strong personality instead of being a kyoani blob doormat, waaaaa <br><br>Deal with it, hipster.</br></br></br>  <br>Does anyone have a copy of that image in a higher resolution?</br>  <br>Although I can see where you are coming from, I don't think her personality is overwhelming enough to be considered a "cunt." She has the personality of most girls you'd meet in the real world, which is why I enjoy her so much; she's like a breath of fresh air in anime. I highly recommend that you go outside and interact with real girls and see what I mean, if you can even manage to get off of your chair and get a girl interested to stay in a conversation with you.</br>  <br> She has the personality of most girls you'd meet in the real world <br><br>I think you might be the one who needs to go outside man. I have met a lot of fucking bimbos and retarded sluts, but this bitch is a whole new level in retarded inconsistencies.</br></br></br>  <br>Learn to reverse search</br>  <br>ty anon</br>  <br>don't feed her, she'll think she's people</br>  <br> Bases his reasoning on the one time he heard girls talk in junior high <br>I don't know where you grew up, but either you have never had girls as friends or you are a shut in who bases his views on how women act based on harems and ecchi anime. I've traveled to and met girls in several countries. Although I've spent a little over half of my life in the US, I've haven't stayed in one place for more than 4 years, traveling from State to State since I was younger. Outside of how girls act in front of strangers, believe it or not, they are human and have complex emotions and personalities for different situations. The "fucking bimbos" and "retarded sluts" are much smarter than you or me but are just in situations that's more complex than you or I could understand. I'd love to discuss this more, but it's hard to explain humans to someone who hasn't interacted with others since middle school.</br></br>  <br>That's not very nice</br>  <br>Don't thank me, thank google.</br>  <br> like an actual human </br>   All these gifs <br> 2015 <br><br>It's like you don't actually love her</br></br></br>  Nao is the best girl of the season by far.<br><br>I'd really love to fuck her sweet butt.</br></br>  <br>FUCKING TUMBLR SHIT</br>  <br>How can I love a 2d girl?

However, it shouldn't matter what website an image is form as long as it is art.</br></br>  I can't wait for the invisiblity doujins  <br>I don't browse that garbage site, but I recognize the terrible artstyle anywhere</br>  Looks like even the physical aspects of wind fail when around Nao.    <br>Is Nao into indecent exposure?</br>  <br>I rather like the art style, but that's just my opinion.<br>Additionally, I reverse searched the image and didn't find any tumlr links, faggot.</br></br>  <br>If I think it's tumblr shit, then it's tumblr shit</br>  <br>Based /a/non, you've done it again.</br>  A true friend  <br> I think, therefore I am. </br>  Wait, why do people have an issue with Nao? Because she bullied the MC, or what? He deserved some bullying.  <br>Thank anon who gave me the high resolution image</br>  You guys actually like this meloshit or just the character?  <br>Beause /a/ is full of insecure guys that need weak female leads to make them feel masculine while for 24 minutes. <br> ITT: A bunch of guys that don't interact with girls </br></br>  <br>I like the anime and characters. It's a breath of fresh air while all the other anime seems to be trying to fit into one type repetitive category with both their genre and characters.</br>  <br>I'm gonna need to save this for future purposes.</br>  <br>For public use</br>  Sometimes, Nao reflects on how many haters she has.  And then she realizes haters don't have shit on her.  Plus she's just a fictional character so she can't really react to haters unless her creators made an OVA with her doing a comedic reaction to the hate       <br>She's entertaining, which is what really matters.</br>  <br>Are we kanon now?</br>    <br>where the fuck do you live?i mean here in asia there some bimbo and slut but not until that stupid,</br>  SEMEN DEMON  Nao a cute  <br>Don't bother.

Then she got blown the fuck out by a powerful saint and the Majin and his bitch is like "should have aborted you." So now Fremy is trying to regain loyalty blah blah blah you'll figure it out sooner in the anime if the pace ever picks up </br></br></br>  <br>But the spoiler is in the unspoiled start of the thread</br>  <br>Well, that much has already been posted since episode 1 aired.</br>  <br><br>So now the strongest man in the world is going to turn her with the power of his dick.</br></br>  <br> She's not trying to regain her loyalty, her mom and the rest of the fiends she chilled with tried to kill her after failing, and now she's sworn revenge against them </br>  Why is Goldoofus such a chump?  <br> I read something about the first saint still being alive and being in love with a demon, how true is this? Does the first saint gag on demon dog cock like bunny? </br>  <br> This is not true   however, the saint of time after the third purge of the majin went crazy and started to hang out with the fiends to discover the origins of the majin <br> <br>Also adlet's sensei is the unknown warrior from 700 years ago</br> </br></br>  <br>He's 16 and was suckered by  BIG FAT BUNNY TATS .</br>  <br>Why did bunny have to take the demonic knot? Literal whore.</br>  <br>Because he's THE STRONGEST CUCK IN THE WORLD</br>  <br>I see, thanks. <br><br> Also bunny being fucked by demon dogs turns me on immensely, where is this revealed? I downloaded vols 1-3 of the translation just to read up on it. </br></br></br>  <br>Dude, he's 16. She's stupidly hot. Plus, she's a saint. And a princess. She's blatant waifubait until you get to know her. Not like he could be expected to know she was a filthy traitor and a cum-guzzling whore. Maybe her exhibitionism should have tipped him off, but the "less is more" dress code seems to not be all that unusual in their world.</br>  <br><br> it's not true, you got meme'd </br></br>  <br>Except even when it's shown that she lied to him his entire life and was also a traitor, he was still the biggest cuck to her</br>  <br><br>When was this? I want to read about bitch tears.</br></br>  <br>Vol3</br>  Daily reminder Bunny literally sucks dog penis  <br><br>Goddamn it. This is why I won't trust anything you guys say until someone provides a passage.</br></br>  <br>Not my first pick but yea</br>  <br>She hasn't betrayed my dick yet.</br>  <br>Could Goldolf beat Adlet?</br>  <br>In a one on one standard fight? Yes. Otherwise Adlet stands a good chance at just whittling him down</br>  <br>Even in his berserk MAH HIME mode?</br>  <br>Fucking Adlet. He is just the strongest cheater in the world.</br>  <br>I can't wait for the doujins of her pulling a train of demons after she gets fucked by Adlet and Goldof.</br>  <br>Using every method available to your advantage is not cheating, it's being strong</br>  <br>Goldof NTR doujins when</br>  <br>Grenadier Mushibugyo best girl.</br>  <br>So its Goldolf=Chamo&gt;Hans</br>  <br>More like Chamo&gt;Hans=Goldolf</br>  <br>She gets crippled later on, wouldn't fuck.</br>  <br> Goldolf gets NTRd <br> watches Hime being a slut <br> loses control and fucks her shit up <br><br>I have a feeling that he actually wouldnt be a beta fag doing nothing.</br></br></br></br></br>   lelele traitor fucks dogs <br><br>god fucking dammit stop speaking in memes what did she do</br></br>  <br>Fun fact<br><br> He does nothing </br></br></br>  <br>I mean if he watched her fuck doggys.</br>  <br><br><br>Literally sucks a dog penis</br></br></br>  <br>JUST<br> PULL<br>THE <br> FUCKING </br></br> <br> BOOB STRAP </br></br></br>  <br>What happens?</br>  <br><br>Goldof would fuck the dogs for her.</br></br>  Can anyone elaborate on the  Adlet being mind controlled to fall in love with Fremy thing?    <br>But why?<br>What does she gain from that?</br></br>  <br> not keeping it on and putting your dick between her boobs <br><br>fucking casual</br></br></br>  <br><br>This is exactly who she reminds me of. She's a bit more rough though. Say the wrong thing and you get shot.</br></br>  <br>Nah. The fact that he slammed her face into the ground means something.</br>  <br><br>Adlet is a fake too, so hes being manipulated</br></br>  <br>I'd rather a sniper that dresses like a whore</br>  <br><br><br>Bridge relations with the demons</br></br></br>  <br>He confused rabbits with dogs. It happens.</br>  <br>She loses an arm.</br>  It's a shame we can't have a decent thread without cancerous LNfags spoiling everyone. LNfags literally make everything worse.  <br>No, I want to pull the strap and slapped it to her boobs. Then when her boobs jiggle because of that, I'll rape her.<br><br>Is that so wrong? why is it so impossible?</br></br></br>  <br>Without LNfags there would be no threads, as there's nothing to talk about atm except "THANK YOU STRONGEST MAN IN THE WORLD" or "I WANT TO PULL HER BOOB STRAP"</br>  the 3d in the second episode fucking sucked also i fucking hate the female designs in this. i'm not even an SJW fag, they just look fucking stupid. i was really into the first episode, but i'm feeling like i'm about to drop this shit really soon.  <br>GOLDOLF IS BECOMING HALF A CUCK. HES GETTING BETTER.</br>  <br> She's a bit more rough </br>    What episode will Bunny betrayal be?  <br>THANK YOU STRONGEST MAN</br>  <br>Will Adlet pull the boob strap?</br>  <br> The strongest man in the world will use any mean necessary to win <br><br>Wouldn't that make him technically the "trickiest" man in the world?<br><br>I mean, Batman can beat anyone but no one considers him strong</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's doing it wrong. The correct response is to kneel and then permanently latch on to her leg, kissing the foot and calves while kicking away any approaching dogs.<br><br>By combining his usual hime worship with intentional trolling Goldof will move his himefagging to the next level.</br></br></br>  I love this show too bad it has shitty budget. It deserved better.  <br>He doesn't have super powers, but he packs a mean punch.</br>  <br>He is also the trickiest man in the world, while also having the title of strongest man. Going around saying you're the trickiest man in the world though doesn't sound as cool<br><br><br> Also who the fuck is Adlet's mentor and why does he know so much about fiends </br></br></br></br>  <br>At this rate? 12.</br>  <br><br>More like Chamo&gt;fuck huge power gap&gt;Hans&gt;Goldolf</br></br>  <br>He's the one slipping bunny the knot.</br>  <br> No she wants peace <br>Okay.<br><br> so she can suck monster D <br>Elaborate.</br></br></br></br></br>  So does the strogest man in the world has any kind of special power/talent at all ? Or he just the strogest ?  <br>The fiends kill humans on contact, if they're at peace, she can fuck them instead<br><br><br>He's completely an ordinary human<br><br>That's what makes him strong</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His is the power of not getting arrested for carrying concealed weapons.</br>  <br> Those thighs <br>She can kill my whole fucking family and I would still fuck her silly.</br></br>  <br> She fucks dogs <br>No she doesn't.<br> likes demons <br>Demons are actually pretty cool guys.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fruit guy is a fucking asshole <br>Dog guy is alright but still an enemy to all humans. <br><br>Haven't read anything about lion yet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't she just tell Goldof about her plan if she knew he'd side with her either way?</br>  <br> demons are cool guys <br> trusting Dozzu <br><br>You're a damned fool</br></br></br></br>  <br>Goldof would only protect her. He wouldn't do shit to help her cause whatsoever.</br>  <br>What mental gymnastics did bunny go through to sincerely believe the fastest way to a world where everybody smiles is to kill half a million people in a demonic invasion? That sounds like terrible PR.</br>  I still don't get this Bunny sucks dog spoiler. Who's dog?<br><br>INB4AGKPIC</br></br>  So when they kill Tgurneu won't shit get kinda boring? Cargikk is just a brute force kinda guy, so it's not like he'll be playing any tricks on the party  <br>It wouldn't have hurt his feelings as much.</br>  <br>It's a meme, dont worry</br>  <br>She doesn't give a shit about his feelings.</br>  <br>She doesn't care. She treasures him as a valuable tool for her agenda, and she knows he accepts that even if it hurts him to just be a tool.</br>  <br> Who is Dozzu anyways </br>  <br>Her character alignment is stupid evil. She gives the bare minimum amount of fucks that he cries bitch tears because of her.</br>  <br>Sounds like something Adrian Veidt would do. I find it acceptable.</br>  <br>It's in Dozzu's best interest to make sure they succeed in killing Cargikk, sure after he's dead Dozzu will pull tricks, but until then he's gotta make sure the party succeeds</br>  I want Aoi Yuuki to insult me in a deadpan tone.  <br>https://dl.bucket.pw/jzhgwc.webm</br>  <br>god the character design in this anime is awful</br>  <br>It's stupider than that, because the demons and humans are supposed to become friends after the demons invaded the world and killed 500,000 people. It's like if Adrian Veidt had bet on the giant squid becoming America's genuine BFF as soon as it was done killing millions of people in NYC.</br>  <br> What mental gymnastics did bunny go through to sincerely believe the fastest way to a world where everybody smiles is to kill half a million people in a demonic invasion? <br><br>Can any LNfags spoil me. seeing posts like this one intrigues me, yet makes me feel kinda stupid for not getting it.<br><br>Like, what is everyone's agenda?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure, if he OD'd on cocaine while executing his plan.</br>  <br>At the moment<br> <br>Adlet: Save the world and protect everyone, while proving he is the strongest man in the world<br>Goldolf: Priority: Protect princess, then save the world<br>Mora: Save her daughter, then the world<br>Chamo: Save the world for fun<br>Hans: Make money saving the world<br>Rolonia: Save the world<br>Nashetania: Work with Dozzu to usurp the current majin with one who doesn't despise humanity, and then kill all corrupt humans on the planet<br>Tgurneu: Take over the fiends by playing the heroes against eachother<br>Cargikk: Take over the fiends by killing all opposition<br>Dozzu: Either is genuine and actually wants peace between fiends and humans, or is playing both sides to control the fiends and also prevent the majins destruction</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br>  <br>She sounds like shit.</br>  <br> Bunny and her demon dog comrade want to unite the demons under a benevolent leader and then invade the human world to kill corrupt aristocrats and people they don't like. It's suggested at the very least hundreds of thousands of people would die, but they figure that's acceptable in the name of the greater good. And then humanity and the demons will become friends and everyone will be happy.<br>The end.</br> </br>  <br>She is shit.</br>  <br>She pisses me off.<br><br>I agree.</br></br></br>  <br>She's dog shit. Like, literally all her shit can be traced back to that fucking demon dog's shit.</br>  <br>Forgot Fremy.</br>  <br>Wow what could go wrong with that plan?</br>  <br>Oh right <br><br> Fremy: Kill Tgurneu for betraying her, and then kill the majin   and fuck adlet </br></br></br>  <br> Fremy: Adlet a best anyone else is shit then revenge </br>  <br>Worst Girl. Who sold that plan to her and why did she even bite it?<br><br><br>Best Girl. I love her now.<br><br><br><br>Thanks guys.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Dozzu fed her the plan<br> <br>Also she's somehow 'combined' with fiends to gain some of their powers</br> <br> That or bunny has been dead for ages, and Dozzu is actually using her as a disguise </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The clear best girl.</br></br>  <br>What other shows have canon dog fuckers?</br>  <br><br>Sounds like best girl</br></br>  <br>Why does she cover her right eye if she's a right-handed shooter?</br>  Is the Mesoamerican-themed setting original to the anime?<br><br>I read a bit of the first volume, and so far the story seems like it's set in a generic western-fantasy universe.</br></br>  <br> Is the Mesoamerican-themed setting original to the anime? <br>Nazca.</br></br>  <br>Her family except for the King had been followers of Dozzu for god knows how long.<br><br>Her being the youngest is obvious to adoctrinate by folllowing her mother and brother as example while daddy was away.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Akame Ga Kill</br></br></br>  <br>Bunny is alive but broken. Talking with Dozzu does that to people. Also their plan is flawed from the start since they couldn't foresee Tgurneu's lovelove plan.</br>  <br>THANK YOU STRONGEST MAN IN THE WORLD</br>  <br> Who sold that plan to her and why did she even bite it? <br>Probably her dog and her mom. She seems to be seriously into the idea, but if she wasn't she'd probably be either dead or imprisoned like her dad.</br></br>  <br>Well, her arm gets severed and she is strangled by tentacles after being ingested by a fiend if that turns you on.  It works for me. </br>  <br>Nazca what?</br>  <br> Malcom in the Middle </br>  <br>Except that it was actually the copy that said that, she was inside the fiend with her throat sliced unable to say the word help.</br>  <br>OTP</br>  <br>Ah, gotcha.</br>  <br>God damn.</br>  <br>Aside from the obvious.  Her father caught on to the plan and the fact that his kingdom had been infiltrated by all these idiots who are working to see the plan carried out. It threw the entire country into civil war and he was eventually imprisoned while his wife, who is in on the plan, and their bitch bunny daughter are running the kingdom. </br>  <br> yfw the emperor wasn't actually insane and was right about killing all the pagans </br>  <br>I want to crush her head!</br>  <br>You seem retarded.</br>  <br>She is so shit she pretty much deserves everything for being so bad.</br>  <br> otp <br> not bunny and a dog </br></br>  <br>Just that you know, nobody is a saint in there and she genuinely believes in a world of peace.</br>  <br>Bunny deserves death or she should sacrifice herself to save face.</br>  <br> Mushibugyo <br>Was this actually any good? Is that qt main/best girl?</br></br>  <br>Rolonia is a saint if you mean morally</br>  <br> You seem retarded. <br>You seem like that one guy who just sits around doing nothing except call everyone retarded while not explaining why.</br></br>  <br>Hybrid race of monstergirls populating the world.<br><br>You like monstergirls don't you?</br></br></br>  <br>Handedness and eye-dominance are unrelated. You can shoot with the opposite eye. My brother is left-eye dominant and right handed, though he's an idiot and tries to shoot left handed because of it.</br>  <br>Imagine if SnK decided it wanted to be an earnest and pure hearted story, instead of a try-hard revenge story. It's fun, but the story isn't good.<br><br> White hair is best girl </br></br></br>  <br> namefag talking </br>  <br> strangled by tentacles after being ingested <br>Did the fiend shit her out?</br></br>  Reminder Fremy Speeddraw is best girl.   horses in mesoamerica   <br>Why doesn't she hide the scar on her forehead with her hair? You know that feels more practical.</br>  <br><br><br>To be fair, letting him in on her plot would have put her at great risk for no reason better than her not wanting him to be sad. And since she's already reconciled with the idea of hundreds of thousands of people dying, coming to terms with herself for making Goldof sad was probably not very hard. She knows Goldof better than to trust him not to fuck up on something that requires a bit of brains. He's muscle, that's all he's good for, and it's for the best that he doesn't try to be anything else. And there's no practical point in telling him if he's just gonna act the same way no matter what.</br></br></br>  So...does she rejoin the good guys again?  <br>She can speeddraw my dick, if you catch my drift.</br>  <br>That sounds like exactly what SnK would have had to be for me to actually like it; non-edgy, not-trying-to-be-good, david-vs-goliath fun.</br>  I think Goldof might be the faggiest thing I have ever seen.  <br>She doesnt actually have a fucked eye, its a ruse to cover her broken horn</br>  <br>She 'rejoins' them but only to further her plans and eventually kill them</br>  <br>Proof that edge-moe does exist.</br>  <br>Of course she would be scared, yet she keeps her cool and manges to act at the right moment to call for aid.<br>Also, the only time they mention shit in the novel is when they talk about how shit Fremy is.</br></br>  <br>Oh, Come on!</br>  <br>Boobstrap.</br>  <br>It was too late when he acted, still props to him for being able to almost thwart Dozzu'z plan.</br>  <br>Does the fiends show any sign of being human-like or friendly? I'm really curious why should he want peace between humans and fiends if all the fiends are mindless, grotesque animals.</br>  <br><br>That's not true, in v4 she and pikachu actually ally with the 7 heroes.</br></br>  <br>No that anon but I catched on it when it was airing past episode 7.<br><br>I really love Mushibugyo x MC interactions.<br><br>Is the first time I automatically shipped the 2 main characters and paid off. They were just too cute.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That must be scary, finding out that most of your kingdom including your entire family are all in on a plot to potentially end humanity<br><br>He did literally nothing wrong by starting his pagan genocide</br></br></br>  <br><br>Like I said, they ally with them to further her own goals, and to kill them down the line<br><br><br>There are fiends that look like humans, and even some fiends who can act human, but at their core they are designed to despise humanity to the fullest. Dozzu may or may not be the only exception</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And that her eye is a different color, right? I know that, just felt like letting my /k/ out a bit.</br>  <br>Giving the assumption that what Dozzu said is true (it's yet to be proven), he wants to achieve armony between fiends and humans by replacing the evil Majin. From what I seem to understand the fiends are influenced by Majin volition, if he wanted peace then they wouldn't attack humans and other shit. The plan isn't fully explained yet.</br>  <br>Is white the main girl? Not getting that impression from the little I've looked up. I'll probably check it out one way or the other, shame I missed it airing just 'cause the 'bug' premise sounded silly.</br>  <br>I didn't read past what's translated but she's threatened by Fremy's explosives, they stated the alleance was only until the other demon generals were defeated, after that they would be enemies again.</br>  <br>She's a very central character to the plot, but as for the love interest, I think it's peach tits.</br>   all it takes to create a saint of something is have a temple and some followers <br><br>I'm surprised that the humans haven't abused this more</br></br>   Favaro and Kaiser aren't the last two Braves   <br><br>She is the main girl, the fucking series has its name like her.<br><br><br>They're not smart, it was Tgurneu the one who came up with that idea.<br><br>Perhaps the method wasn't known.<br><br>So it's fine to blame Mora and her predecessors for this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mora a shit</br>  <br>Akame Ga Kirru</br>  <br>She had that coming. Honestly, I was kinda pissed she didn't get worse. I want her body broken, I want Goldof to grow some fucking balls and recognize her for the malignant and disastrously moronic person she is, and I want her to recognize her ideals are shit and that all she's done is shit.</br>  <br>Nah, she is delicious and she could do far worse. I wouldn't say she deserves it, but I am glad it happens, since it does turn me on very much.</br>  Truly a dastardly villain  <br>This upsets me greatly. I think I'm going to drop this now.</br>  How does Madlet and Fremy feel about their love being a sham?  <br><br>She only did that because she had to, not because she has a natural inclination towards violence.</br></br>  <br>Why does that upset you<br><br><br><br>I wish I knew, translations never</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this your first anime where the main girl is a terrible person who wants a piece of the apocalypse happening?</br>  Whelp spoiled, oh well, who cares about plot twists anyway  <br>I bet there's going to be an asspull with wasps somehow.</br>  <br>Ha! Deserved it.</br>  Who is Dozzu  <br>Why did she do this? There's no reason for her to be a dumb slut on top of being a traitorous cunt with a retarded plan.</br>  <br>One of the three fiends who gained the ability of coherent thought</br>  Nashetania did nothing wrong.  <br>Not killing Adlet on the way to the meeting point is something she did wrong</br>  <br>So is it like, they evolved or they ate human brain and became sentient or were they created that way?<br><br>Pic partly related I just want to post a sexy pic from this series' OP just for added relevance and kicks.</br></br></br>  <br> a dumb slut on top of being a traitorous cunt with a retarded plan. <br>Reminds me of another character I know.</br></br>  <br>She wasted the big shot of her life, she might a gifted character but she is pretty incompetent.<br><br>The only reason she went this far because she is backed up by a pokemon.</br></br></br>  <br>They were created that way</br>  <br>Okay, she may be dumb, but she's not a slut just yet.</br>  <br><br>DAMN IT.<br>Why do I bother with these threads? <br>Goddamn spoilers. adofkaj;lfdjaflkjf</br></br></br></br>  why do they always have to ruin decent shows with fucking animal ears?  and who you think the main girl is? if it bunny i would killed muhself  <br>Actually, you should kill yourself regardless due to your horrible grammar.</br>  <br>so sry about my grammar</br>  So does the rabbit die or not?  <br>does anyone have the webm for this part plus the stealing part ?</br>  <br> Let me guess, and due to her lineage she was ostracized and worse by people? <br> That's why she tries to do this kind of stuff? <br><br>Why not? It seems possible to me. If the government and people generally screwed me over, then if I ever got the power to screw society right back, I'd do it in a flash. I'd be clever about it though to reduce the chance of getting suspected or caught. If the downfall of society can be done, revenge is sweet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>nice blog</br>  <br> Guy isn't the king of the braves <br><br>series would improve exponentially</br></br></br>  <br>No she just loses an arm and she was born with retardation.</br>  Why are the beautiful ones always the stupidest?  <br>Because they think they're hot shit and smart.</br>  <br>Because they don't have to work as hard due to getting advantages due to their beauty. So they don't exercise their mind enough.</br>  <br>Inferior mondaijitachi clone, with worse MC, writing and inferiour traitorous rabbit.</br>  <br>I like Rokka's MC more because he isn't as "lel I ruse you epic win XDDD" as Shitzayoi.</br>  <br>You also need a saint of fate trapped in your basement ready to be wrung dry of her saintly powers.</br>  <br> "lel I ruse you epic win XDDD" <br>Good criticism.</br></br>  <br>Rabbits doesn't look like that</br>  <br>Izayoi is "stronkk" the same way Rocka MC is. Rocka MC is cheater with lots of tricks in sleeve, winning just because people dont expect them. Izayoi is winning because he does his homework and comes prepared for fights. Super strength and speed matter little when battling gods with super gifts. Izayoi wins by wits, and not from being "lel smart" but, from doing research.</br>  So, do we have a VA for fig yet?<br><br>Also, is this 13 eps? Because at this pace it will end when cow arrives.</br></br>  <br>Will we get to see her go full dere?</br>  <br>Very late of volume 1, ep 10-11 I guess</br>  <br>Because THE STRONGEST MAN IN THE WORLD is a virgin and she know she can manipulate him by giving him sexual attention</br>  <br>Manipulate him to do what?</br>  <br>To defend her when she gets cornered just like he does many times to Fremy.</br>  <br>What a cunt.</br>  <br><br>Nashtania's plan says nothing about Fiends invading and killing 500,000 people. She never got a chance to elaborate what would cause that.</br></br>  It's obvious she'll be proved right in the end. She's the peace princess who wants coexistence.  <br>Nashetania was right just like hitler.</br>  <br>Gotdayum those are some fine ass tittys and bitch got thighs like woah.</br>  <br>She and Dozzu are using methods that anything to achieve though. They both Well Intentional Extremists.</br>  <br>*Intentioned*</br>  <br>well, she cant kill those 500,000 people on her own right ?. Those "human friendly" demon gonna do it for her</br>  <br>cant blame dog, he only has eyes and muscles</br>  <br>The anime gave her more tits. Too bad she is complete shit inside though.</br>  <br>I don't think it's appropriate to describe mass murder as well intentioned.</br>  <br>Series would automatically turn into an 11/10.</br>  Bunnies are for procreating  <br>This bunny I would rape and not feel bad about it</br>  <br>But she has thousand kyoumas inside her belly.</br>  <br>Once again who says those 500,000 deaths are coming from Fiends? What would be the point of changing the Majin then Fiends kill humans? It's more like those sacrifices are probably coming from something unavoidable.<br><br><br><br>That's what it is.<br><br>Mass murder isn't the point, just necessary evil from their point of view to achieve a lasting solution. If there is someone with a better idea to fix this mess they should .</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If LNfags any are still around, did Adlet get possessed or not? (That's what I assumed the reason we see the darkness engulf him, grant his wish to be brave and make him pass out before he wakes up with the mark)  <br>I knew ever since princess a shit.</br>  Just finished the first 3 episodes. <br><br>I am wondering what it will be going forward. I like the MC and I feel like I can root for him, the setting seems decent enough and the visuals are nice but I am not liking any of the other characters. They all seem like they're cuntbags save for Goldof. Also the story sounds sorta lame, 6 heroes fighting a great evil that is awakening.<br><br>Should I push forward? Are the LNs worth it? I can read moon so I am not limited by TLs.</br></br></br></br>  <br> If there is someone with a better idea to fix this mess they should . <br><br>That's the heroes are for isn't it?<br><br> A solution that isn't permanent <br><br>or<br><br> A solution that hasn't been proven yet with a very, very high cost. <br><br>If both fail then it's the end. Also solution 2 has more chances to fail than solution 1.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes? So? Did you check out the other works by the author? She's being pragmatic unlike most dumb peace princesses.<br><br>The fact the mc was brainwashed into loving fremy is a flag he doesn't love her at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Traitorous rabbit &gt; rabbit</br>  <br> That's the heroes are for isn't it? <br><br>The heroes are part of the problem.</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=LTK<wbr>_-Roaozg</wbr>  [ ]  She's a cute and innocent bunny.  <br>I tried reading the first chapter of the LN today, and couldn't get past the second chapter because of the shitty writing.<br><br>It could just be a bad translation, but I kind of doubt that.</br></br></br>  I like harlots  <br> Was this actually any good? <br>Only when she was around.<br> Is that qt main/best girl? <br>Yes, got 75% support from the poll after last episode.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dunno if the starting chapters are good, I skipped ahead to where the anime is now and went from there and I enjoyed it</br>  <br><br>Surely it can't get more retarded than this guy.</br></br>  <br> dumb slut <br>She's trying to get another Goldof.</br></br>  An Aztec setting for once is kinda refreshing.  <br>I was exited for it in the first episode, but by the second I feel like it's more of a backdrop than integral to the story. all the flowers are western style.</br>  <br>Glad the better girl will snatch him.</br>  <br>while the setting is really good I don't think japan likes settings like these.</br>  Why is She best Loli among ALL Lolis?   Read volume 1-3  <br><br>Why does the author have such a fascination with traitorous whores?</br></br>  <br>He got betrayed often IRL</br>  <br>Bunny and Dozzu want to kill a large amount of humans to achieve pertetual peace and harmony thus saving an even greater amount of people.<br><br>On the other hand the heroes want to kill a small amount of people (bunny &amp; co. plus everyone else that will get killed in the next fiend invasions) to avoid them killing a large amount, and this is the most hypocritical thing ever.<br><br>Even if I don't agree on the part of killing every corrupt ruler their solution is far better than the temporary truce the heroes are aiming for, what needs to be truly done is to find a permanent solution to the fiend issue, and at the moment dozzu's one seems the only possible.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Now that's sad. No wonder she's so pessimistic looking.</br></br>  <br> family issues <br> poor girl :((( <br>She's still a cunt for killing all the potential heroes.</br></br></br>  <br>So Dozzu is Hitler?</br>  <br><br>It seems people are talking with the assumption everything she does is inherently bad.</br></br>  <br>Well nobody's perfect. Seems nobody's perfect in this story either.<br><br>Except for  World's Strongest Man . And even then he probably has flaws.</br></br></br>  <br>We can't say for sure yet, after all they're keeping most details of their plan secret.</br>  <br> He's the second traitor and he's been brainwashed to fall in love with Fremy. </br>  <br>OK, I'm willing to believe in this. Especially the latter.</br>  <br><br>Mind explaining?</br></br>  <br> perpetual peace <br> except everyone fucking knows that's not how peace works. As it stands Humanity has something to stand against as a whole, with only lesser conflicts (as there are still and there will always be issues between large groups), and then the issues we have now between individuals. <br><br>Or at least that's what I was thinking, until I thought harder about what I was saying and realized that living in the state of perpetual fear that can only end with the destruction of humans or a continuation of the status quo is an awful position to be in.<br><br>The pessimist in me can't see any ending being a happy one, but I think if Dozzu isn't a shitter, it at least offers a future.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, my point was that the heroes disagree with Dozzu not because they want the best for humanity but because he tried to kill them, but if they are truly heroes they should be ready to sacrifice their lifes for a better cause like bunny said she is willing to do.</br>  <br><br><br>Except dozzu's plan is most likely bullshit, and if they trust him and he betrays them, humanity is fucked<br><br>He's easily the least safe option</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>especially the second part</br>  <br><br><br>That's what the guys who've read the 5th novel said, I'm stuck at what's been translated but it is believable since in the 4th novel they state that he could unconsciously be the second 7th and they partially remove him from leadership.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That assumes he's sincere and it's hard not to be suspicious. <br><br><br><br>Dozzu's too much an unknown quantity to be trusted entirely. That he's been somewhat helpful doesn't undo the fact that he's basically told them that they're just allies of convenience and has attempted to kill them before. He keeps dangling revelations and info on the nature of the majin but doesn't reveal it because he feels it'll make it harder for him to win.<br><br>It'd be to his benefit if he could turn the 6 heroes to his side. Instead, he just decided to try and kill them. He and bunnyprincess haven't really tried to convince them of anything, which makes me suspect their motives. There's still some information he keeps secret that could perhaps help turn the six heroes to his cause but he basically thinks they would never turn. The only real attempt they made to get them on their side was with Goldof, and that was entirely playing on his loyalty to bunnyprincess. He's had a few hundred years, surely he's got a better pitch than "world peace" and "can't make an omelette without breaking some eggs".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Obviously, they should really stop playing a dolls in the fight between the fiend generals and start reasoning about what's to be done without being swayed by their selfish motifs.</br>  <br><br>It's basically this<br><br>Defeat majin: Guarantee peace for around 300 years, and make the next attempt way easier because the three fiend masterminds are dead<br><br>Help Dozzu: Either world peace with fiends controlling humanity or doom humanity to extinction because dozzu tricked them</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Or take a third option. They're already far more aware (or so it seems) than the previous braves were when they embarked.</br></br>  <br><br>Well that's very possible, as Adlet is all about taking the 'other' option</br></br>  All the version disregard that little unimportant factor in their situation named  gods. <br><br>Somehow they consider situation from point of view maijin vs humanity, ignoring where the Braves power come in first place and who could be actual origin of Maijin and what their reaction would be on humanity attempting the Dozzu plan.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br> Tgurneu/Fig's power is to make people fall in love with him, First/original saint is alive and sealed herself away in the the continent, no one knows why but the time mage from the previous cycle revealed this secret to the majin leaders through their time traveling adventures together.<br><br>Fig uses his power of love to take control of the first saint and uses it to create a 7th brave and also a black flower brave (not sure what the right terminology is, I read the chinese translations) that will absorb the protective powers of the braves (normal humans can't survive in the majin continent). Fig believes that the power of love can overcome anything so he lets Adlet fall in love with Fremy (she's the black flower) and protect her from everything, including herself.</br></br> <br><br> This is all revealed in vol 5, it revolves around the braves finding the sealed first saint's dungeon thing and it's both tense and bizarre, with Fremy admitting that she the most likely candidate to be the black flower and thus wanting to kill herself. Hans and Chamo agrees to kill her if she couldn't do it herself and Adlet starts spinning lies so Fremy lives. He then takes Mora hostage and fights Fremy/Hans/Chamo with Rolonia but then he fights against Rolonia and so on, with people constantly switching sides because of Adlet's lies, 2 majin's brainwashing. Surprising, Nashetania and Dozzu were docile and Nashentania, being the cute traitorous bunny managed to 'betray' both the braves and the majins, defeating them. Hans and Chamo leaves the party as both of them feel the others are too trusting of Adlet. <br><br> In the end, it's revealed that the winner is Adlet, he fools the majins into helping him (saying he's there as the 7th and Fremy's guard, which he didn't know he is) and manages to convince the others to let Fremy live. Fig reveals at the last few lines that Adlet indeed is the 7th. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Strongest  cunt  in the world.</br>  <br> hans and chamo gone <br><br>Dont much care about chamo gone, but Hans was Adlet's bro, I hope he returns</br></br></br>  <br>So, is the novel approaching it's end? In what sense does Adlet win and in what sense are the majins defeated?<br><br><br>Since they split they seem an easy target.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Damn...... The power of love is strong indeed. I do hope that Fremy at least gets a happy ending.<br><br>On a side note; Has anyone eaten rabbit before? It's surprisingly delicious.....</br></br></br></br>  <br>thanks anon you made my day</br>  <br>So what was the black flower? Why was it a trump card?</br>  <br> rabbit betrays the group for what she believes it's the best for humanity <br>what a whore<br> strongest man in the world manipulates everybody for his selfish reasons <br>he's truly in love!</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not his fault, he's being mind controlled</br>  <br>And that's why it's not love.</br>  <br>So Adlet is worst than Rabbit? He betrays everyone for a cunt?<br><br>At least Rabbit has aspirations.</br></br></br>  Might as well give a quick summary of vol 5.<br><br> Before 5:<br> Party knows of a black flower brave <br> Only Adlet and Hans knows it's Fremy <br> First saint is alive and in a temple <br> Party wants to investigate the temple and it's their top priority <br> Fig intends of corner the party in the temple since that's his territory <br> Fig sends his numbered majins after the party, 2 survived and sneaked into the temple <br><br>During 5:<br> Party enters temple and sees first saints, she's barely alive and looks like a mummy (or skeleton, I forgot, but alive) <br> Party investigates the magic around her to find out about the black flower brave <br> Hans urges Adlet to reveal the truth <br> Adlet didn't do it previous because he think it's premature (he doesn't want to admit it because of LOVE) <br> Party splits up to investigate the temple, bunny and dog stayed in main room with Goldof <br> Adlet spots majin's corpse and comes up with a lie <br> Party gathers and started discussion about black flower brave and whether he/she is the 7th <br> Fremy admits she's the black flower brave and offers to kill herself, much to Hans' surprise <br> He and Chamo offers to kill her if she cannot do it herself <br> Adlet started spouting lies about finding some message in a rune from the majin corpses he found earlier, it says something along the lines of 'don't believe in what you hear about the black flower brave, it's Fig's trap' <br> Mora scans the area but she cannot find the thing Adlet spoke of <br> Hans started getting suspicious and confronts Adlet about lying (he was tailing Adlet) <br> Adlet says it must the work of an enemy majin that his evidence is gone, but he isn't lying <br> Fremy tells him to stop lying <br> Adlet takes Mora hostage </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br>  <br>AdletxBunny confirmed.</br>  <br>That was pretty random.</br>  <br> majins corpse <br><br>Wait what? It's already dead?</br></br></br>  <br>He's not in love with Fremy. It's brainwashing.<br><br>She's falseflagging, anon.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks anon.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but why shipping him with bunny? At least that's what I've intended.</br>  <br>What other choice are there? Fremy is out of the race completely because he loves her against his will.<br><br>That never becomes endgame. She's basically a false love interest.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This all confuses the shit out of me<br><br>Where is the story going to go?</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's the only one left. <br><br>They both betrayed the party now. Bunny will get some character development so will he.</br></br></br>  <br>What about not shipping? It's not like this is a love comedy. Also bunny is 100 better with Goldolf.</br>  <br><br>Isn't bunny a cripple now?</br></br>  <br> &gt;Kyoumas work in the background to fuck the party up using their super secret language<br> One of them, a lizard, used to be Fremy's 'family' <br> Every now and then he interrupts the story and starts thinking about Fremy, letting readers know about Fremy's life story <br> He attacks Adlet while Adlet is running away <br> Hans, Chamo, Nashetania, Fremy and Rolonia chases after him <br> Hans, Fremy and Rolonia finds Adlet first whereas Chamo goes on defensive to sweep the place for majins and Nashetania because she disappeared after defending Rolonia (poor girl believed in Adlet's lies) <br> Hans started revealing Adlet's treachery  <br> Adlet has his own story about how it's all Fig's mindgames <br> A majin hides nearby trying to incite aggressiveness in the braves making them excited and trigger happy <br> Adlet fights against Fremy and Hans <br> Rolonia can't stand the fighting so she offers to be Adlet's hostage <br> She attacks Adlet instead because of brainwashing <br> Nashetania approaches the lizard Kyouma and offers to help <br> The lizard doesn't believe her but gives her simple orders to protect Fremy anyway, because that might be what Fig wanted <br> By the way, Fig isn't around to give orders so he has to decide the best course of action <br> Fig is approaching the temple though, he started talking about love </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> <br><br><br>My bad, I messed up the terms, it should be Kyouma.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It would be funny to see Goldolf be cucked by Adlet</br>  <br>You can see it for yourself <br> Would still make bunnies with her while helping her facing her handicap </br></br>  <br>Whats your opinion on what will happen next, spoiler-san?</br>  <br><br>I'd watch it.</br></br>  <br>Nah, fuck Goldof. I'd rather see Bunny dies in dozzu's arm rather than Godolf actually getting his happy end.</br>  <br> she's going to betray the people who trust her and put in danger all of humanity <br> something "bad" will happen to her <br> MC will forgive her <br> the viewers will forgive her <br><br>Fuck this gay world.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> dies in dozzu's arm.  <br><br>Anon please. Bunny should get eatten until only the brain remains  by a mob of Kyouma  Just like Sumika </br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Lizard kyouma told the other Kyouma that they have to prevent Fremy's death, if not they have to start preparing for the 'sucession ceremony'<br> He did this in his super secret language &gt;Nashetania, still there, told lizard that she never wanted to help them in their own secret language <br> Murders the fuck of out of lizard <br> Finds something intriguing in lizard's corpse and brings it to Adlet and friend <br> She says that it used to be a rune that contained a message, and therefore Adlet didn't lie <br> Adlet, now with evidence, asserted his stance and says it's all Fig's ploy, there are kyoumas around and they're all following Fig's orders to turn them against each other <br> He himself was fighting a terrible headache and intend to kill, and interprets it as a kyouma's brainwashing <br> Rolonia fell to it that's why she attacked him <br> The rest of the braves started believing Adlet <br> Fremy doesn't want to kill herself anymore and ran away with Adlet, wanting to find the surviving kyouma while being chased by Hans and Chamo <br> She bombs the fuck out of the places a kyouma might be hiding and defeats it <br> The braves decides to gather to discuss the issue at hand but Hans and Chamo escapes, he finds that the others are to trusting of Adlet, Chamo just wants to be with Hans and thinks he is always right <br> The rest meets up in the main room and they apologizes to Adlet </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br>  <br><br>Spoiler:<br> They don't forgive her and even attempt to kill her </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah at the beginning, but it'll only serve to fuel a bigger pity party and make the reader feel bad about her situation, and put her in a spot where she can be saved by MC.</br>  <br>But Adlet is actually doing the right thing by protecting Fremy right?<br>I thought the black barren flower is triggered when Fremy dies, why are Hans and the others are so gungho to lit the bomb?</br></br>  Anyone knows if V.6 has been announced yet?  <br>That's so fucked up, who's going to take responsability?</br>  <br>Fuck is this vol.1 all over again.<br><br>I just want Fremy x Adlet moments man.</br></br></br>  <br>When did this happen?</br>  <br>Seems like it's all falling apart, and I thought the party was making good progress</br>  <br><br>At this point I'm not even sure what I want anymore.</br></br>  <br>No, killing her is the right choice. Something bad will happen is the lie from Adlet to keep her alive.</br>  <br> Now for the fun part:<br><br> Adlet reveals that while he was escaping the others (after taking Mora hostage) the lizard kyouma tried communiating with him <br> He ignored it since that's what a treacherous servant of Fig is more inclined to do, and yeah he's trying to fool the kyoumas <br> After escaping further, he finally has a solid plan and asks for the lizard kyouma, and he was indeed there so Adlet believes that he succeed in fooling them <br> He orders the lizard (7th brave should be of a higher rank than lizard) to protect Fremy at all costs since that was Fig's order for the 7th <br> And lizard will have to do it at all costs, even if it endangers Adlet <br> To sow confusion among the braves and protect Fremy, Adlet orders lizard again, this time to talk about a 'succession ceremony' in the presence of a brave so they are confused whether a black flower brave will be succeeded by another brave if the original dies <br> Last order for lizard was to find a rune and eat it and keep it in his stomach <br> Lizard, fully convinced that only Fig's chosen one can be that insidious and determined to carry out Fig's plot, orders brainwashing kyouma to get near to brainwash braves that are fast approaching <br> Lizard attacks Adlet, so Adlet can try to convince the others that he saw a kyouma <br> Adlet is happy that Fremy is alive though he doesn't know why <br> Even before all this Hans already commented on Adlet's odd fixation with Fremy <br> Fig is now approaching the temple <br> Before this he started spouting stuff about how the power of love was the strongest and during his experiments, people were able to do crazy stuffs for the ones they love <br> He reveals that Adlet is the 7th, and his brave <br>Somewhere on the continent, no.6 (Fremy's biological kyouma mum) and Fremy's pet dog are still alive and living in a cottage waiting to reunite with Fremy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br>  <br> Hans and Chamo are the only legit heroes everyone else are pawns, traitors or gullible  <br>Feels good.</br></br>  <br><br>   The braves decides to gather to discuss the issue at hand but Hans and Chamo escapes, he finds that the others are to trusting of Adlet, Chamo just wants to be with Hans and thinks he is always right <br><br>They escaped because  Adlet tricked the other braves into believing that Hans is the seventh </br></br></br></br>  I want Hans and Chamo to murder Fremy, Madlet and Bunny.<br><br>Gondolf, Mora and Rolonia can apologize to Hans later.</br></br>  <br><br> &gt;adlet is the 7th<br> adlet also brainwashed to like fremy <br> fremy's family is apparently not bad <br> the party is split and fig is almost there to an unprepared party <br/></br></br></br> <br><br>what the FUCK is going on</br></br></br></br>  <br>My mistake then, thanks for the correction.</br>  <br>   He orders the lizard (7th brave should be of a higher rank than lizard) to protect Fremy at all costs since that was Fig's order for the 7th <br><br>No.  He ordered him to kill Fremy at all cost so he can prove his lies about Fig seriously want her dead to trigger the bomb. The super secret language was also his order so Nashetania would pick up some random "succesion" about the black flower once Fremy dies. </br></br></br>  <br>piece of shit.<br><br>he's worse than bunny. bros over shitty emo hos.</br></br></br>  <br>power of love is scary</br>  <br>Bantorra was pretty much nothing but that.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128470890 <br><br>B-but he's being brainwashed</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128470890 <br>Hans and Chamo don't deserve bad endings.</br>  <br><br>Deleted cause didn't spoiler tag.</br></br>  Wow, volume 6 is going to be one hell of a ride given all this  After reading all this shit it's really hard to like anyone in this show. I think I'm going to pull for a happy ending for the horses.  <br>To then die killed by the majin thus marking humanity's doom.</br>  <br>Hans and Chamo. Mora is just misguided/fooled too, so she's not guilty of falling for lies.</br>  <br>With this reasoning Bunny is just fooled by Dozzu and Adlet is just fooled by Fig.</br>  vol 6 is released at 24th right?  <br>Would Adlet  dump/kill Fremy if the mind control was broken? If not, then we can't really blame mind control for his treachery. </br>  <br>Adlet and Bunny willingly BETRAYED the party, Mora and Rolonia think Hans betrayed them, it's different and you know it.<br><br>Either way, Hans and Chamo are the only ones looking good in this mess.</br></br></br>  <br>He might not kill her because his whole "I gotta protect everyone" bullshit but I imagine he would dump her</br>  Adlet would regain his sanity if Fig died, guess that's how vol 6 would end.  Adlet a shit.<br><br>Worse than Bunny.</br></br>  <br>What a mess.</br>  <br>This is the kind of expectation you should completely drop with this author.</br>  If you could choose your own stand what would it be?  <br>I've always wanted Killer Queen just because it had cat ears. I just want to touch them.</br>  made in heaven  <br>Cheap Trick</br>  Supa Hot Fire  Foul feats fulfilled at a bargain  <br>Za Warudo or Emperor - both those are baller as fuck</br>  <br>Isn't Emperor essentially just a gun.</br>  <br> Improves user's reflexes and reactions <br> stealth weapon, can summon whenever <br> HOMING. BULLETS. <br>Yeah, but it'll still be a great stand for general life and i wonder if you could ever learn double up and dual wield</br></br></br></br>   not wanting Death 13 <br>do you even lali ho?</br>  <br>I want MILF hunter Kekyoin as my stando</br>  Catch the Rainbow. It wouldn't be the most useful stand, but it'd be the one that would give me the most fun.  I think heaven's door would be awesome because you could just go around reading about peoples lives and shit. Also being able to force people's will by writing rules on them is so powerful.  <br>Uncleanly doings made cheaply</br>  <br><br>Hard to say, but Heaven's Door is fucking OP.</br></br>  Schlong Slinger  Easily Star Platinum<br>Stronk as fuck and I would be able to draw so well I wouldn't need the manga aspect of Heavens Door. Plus time stop and I'm basically set, plus all the plot armor. Second would be Tusk because it just seems like a neat stand</br>  Id need a straight forward powerful one like star platinum or something, im not clever like a jojo character so i couldnt make the weaker ones work. And its important to be blatantly overpowered because stand users being drawn to eachother means id have to encounter some of you faggots.  Mandom.<br><br>There are so many applications of reversing 6 seconds in my life. Cheating the fuck out of RNG is the main one.<br><br>I don't need some bulletproof iron-wrenching punch ghost. I need the ability to undo my mistakes.</br></br></br></br>  Strength.<br><br>I've always wanted a boat.</br></br>  <br>If /a/nons with stands often encountered each other do you think we'd fight? I'm pretty sure we'd just wank to the fact we have stands</br>  <br>That hair looks really out of place, it really looks flat as fuck compared to everything else.</br>  "Razzmatazz"<br>It'd literally be the soul of Frank Sinatra</br>  <br>It'd be the scene where Polnareff and Kakyoin do the secret handshake, only stretched out over our entire meeting.<br><br>I'm absolutely sure you faggots would fight eachother though, just to jerk over the fact that you can. And of course there's be that one guy who had to make everyone his fuckboys.</br></br></br>  <br>i forgot the ability again, freezing raindrops midair and walking on them right?</br>  So who was stronger SP or the world? Dio did punch through SP's attacks but was he just lucky? Yes SP ultimately did kill the world but that's because Dio was already hurt  <br>I'd be friends with you anon. We could fight all the fuck boys together, because be honest, some fighting with your SUTANDO POWA does seem cool. <br>On some basic stuff what would people use their stand the most for? I'd probably  use the stand to get the remote and get me a drink <br><br>Yeah<br><br>They seem about equal, I'd say SP is stronger just due to the compensation for it's range while The World has a much larger range in comparison</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Run the Jewels<br><br>Ability to move at a fast acceleration, hide and store objects</br></br>  <br>I like the reference <br>I'd do King Krule <br>When it hits someone they experience their worst experiences and or feel an extremely heavy drug trip, of course with the ability to weaken said trips</br></br></br>  <br>If I had time stop or whatever, lewd shit, for sure. Or I'd use it to get myself some easy cash and live the good life. I'd basically go full NEET like DIO did.</br>  Heaven's Door or maybe Diver Down they both seem pretty cool. I wouldn't want a combat stand, because it seems really fucking useless.  <br>But anon, that's unjust. I would do the lewd though. Would sign up for those "Strongest man" tv shows and use SP to lift</br>  <br>I'd say what really makes a difference between SP and the world is the users. Dio being a vampire gives him a much longer time stop duration, but I think jotaro's wits makes him and his SP stronger in the end.</br>  <br>It fits well after affect should be insomnia</br>  <br>I was thinking of that, but also an effect on the user from over use would be insomnia.  I want to write a JoJo knock off with all the potential music references I know Araki doesn't listen to. </br>  Crazy Diamond for sure. Just seems to match my personality  <br>a stand who make you poop in your pants until you die of malnutrition.<br><br>I called it The Final Countdown.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd probably grab Jailhouse Rock, just because it's the stand I personally fear the most by far, and it'd make me feel a lot more comfortable knowing 'I' was the one with control of that stand.<br><br>I'd rather fight Dio 1v1 without a stand of my own (Die.) than face Jailhouse Rock.<br><br>I'd rather die than live the rest of my life with fucking alzheimers.</br></br></br></br></br>  My stand would be called anal cunt. He would show up, shut on the ground, call me gay, then leave  <br>as someone who works with alzheimers patients for research, after all i've seen, if I developed it later on in life I would most likely off myself, because we are not gunna have a cure by the time I'm 60-70</br>  <br>So the spirit and stand of /a/?</br>  <br>I haven't read through it in a while but watching the anime recently It looked like SP did the killing punch on the same spot on The world as where Dio had his legs fucked up moments before. I was assuming it was Dios arrogant personality attacking with his injured body that got him killed.</br>  <br>Yaaaaooooooo, I volunteered at a nursing home for a summer, that's how I learned I'd fucking end my life if I ended up like that too.<br><br>Well, I would if I could even remember that I wanted to die.<br><br>Just gotta make some suicide pacts I guess...<br><br>You know you have a friend when they'll visit you while you're sick. You know you have a best friend when they'll put a bullet in your fucking brain when you won't get better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  you are now imagining all of bizarre adventure being told as a re-cap by some guy with a Brooklyn accent  <br>now listen here u lil shit</br>  So, was Vanilla Ice a true vampire or a zombie? I thought you could only become a vampire via Stone Mask shenanigans, but the people Dio Brando turned into zombies generally looked all grey and weird.  <br>The zombies looked strange and gray, and Vanilla Ice didn't, I mean.</br>  <br><br>It's easy to say this when we have recollection of memory, but as I see it, if you can't remember the horror of the condition, there is no longer any horror to it. Now I don't know how they see it, so my view might be simplistic philosophical bs.</br></br>  <br>Highway Star</br>  <br> once i marry and have children im going to put it in my will </br>  <br><br>it's been a while since I saw the fight but I don't remember vanilla ice regenerating at all during the fight so he might as well have been a zombie right? I get what you mean about the look but I don't think we have enough references other than the abomination zombies to say what they had to look like.</br></br>  <br> If you could choose your own stand what would it be? <br><br>A gay one.</br></br></br>  <br>That's why the condition creeps me out so much on a deep existential level.<br><br><br> Good idea, I'll do the same. Fuck that noise. </br></br></br></br>  <br>done</br>  Floral Shoppe<br><br>Power E<br>Precision D<br>Speed C<br>Range C<br>Durability C<br>Potential B<br><br>The stand itself manifests itself as a pink fog that can quickly surround objects.<br><br>Objects covered in the gas cannot exert a presence on anything outside its range. For example, covering a police car in the fog means that people won't be able to see or hear it or the noise the sirens make and a person walking into the fog will simply pass the car and end up on the other side.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And breaking your body down to follow raindrops, like he did by sending his jaw down with a drop and biting Johnny's shoulder IIRC.</br>  "Teen Spirit"<br><br>My stand would have a ghost like physical appearance and my powers only work on people the ages of 13-19. My "teen spirit" stand has the ability to poses any teenagers body and take over full control of their consciousness.<br><br> I will only use this stand to do lewd stuff with teenage girls. This stand will most likely not be suitable for combat situations unless I'm fighting another stand user who is in the teenage age bracket and then I could just command them to kill themselves. </br></br></br></br>  <br>ayy lmao</br>  <br>As a philosophy  minor  it doesn't scare me within my perspective, however if I do know of my condition and could remember how I can't remember shit then yeah, I'll probably be inclined to do something rash. I might as well put it in my will too, thanks for thought to.</br>  <br>that feels like a stand that would be overpowered if araki put it in the series.</br>  <br>Should be called Smells like Teen Spirit.  The aftereffect of the stand is that if used for too long the teenager has an increase in suicidal thought, so if used for stuff like interrogation you'd have to time it wisely and not over use it. Also since it is "teen spirit" maybe if said teenager has a stand you can make use of their stand as well </br>  <br>Lol, Philosophy. What a waste of college money, why don't you get a real degree like  Sociology with a minor in Anthropology, for the love of God end my life plz. </br>  <br> I'm majoring in Anthropology mate, I just plan on doing med school after </br>  <br>In my country you can apply for self-termination. Just fill in the paperwork and pick out a date and a doctor will be dispatched to your location with a syringe.<br>No need to wait for a slow, agonizing death. Time is money wasted.</br></br>  I was re-watching a few episodes of stardust crusaders and for all the crap ive heard about part 3 no one ever talks about the 4th wall being broken during wheel of fortune. <br>this scene made me laugh so hard. too bad this is probably the only instance of it in part 3 or any other part.</br>  <br>If you can choose then why not choose the most broken Stand?</br>  <br>That isn't Heaven's Door or Hey Ya.</br>  <br>I don't know anon, Gold exerience requiem is pretty bullshit. I mean I know the translation for part 5 is ass, but from what I could tell it basically negated king crimsons power and said "fuck you" over and over again.</br>  <br>That's pretty cool dude. I thought about going into forensic anthropology so I could be a fucking coroner (People keep telling me that's creepy as fuck, but I just remember being fascinated when I dissected shit back in the day.), but I'm starting to think I'll just do some social work and then go into law later.<br><br>That, or maybe join the army as an officer and try to get a civil affairs position where I can oversee our relations with some foreign country somewhere. I got a 97 on my ASVAB (A 96 is required.), so that means I can definitely do it.<br><br>I wanna hold off on making those decisions until later on though, for now I'm happy being a broke college student fucking around on the internet.</br></br></br></br></br>  Expectations for EoH? After seeing N'Doul play out, I'm hoping for more gimmicky characters like Mountain Tim.  <br>fuck man N'doul is gonna b everyones partner come full game hes just the best support</br>  C-moon. <br>It would be cool to be able to float around and if I feel like it I could go to Florida and reset the universe in whatever way I want.</br>  <br> Time in a bottle <br><br>The ability to reverse time by 30 seconds with only its effects being known to the user. I would only use it for gambling (Roulette/Craps) and wouldn't bother doing stand fights or anything badass. Just doing some gambling to make enough money to live the way that I want to.</br></br></br>  <br>That's just a stronger Mandom.</br>  <br> I want Ringo Roadagain's stand Mandom except better in every way. <br>There's gotta be a downside Anon, like you have to age a month every time you do it, and it makes your hair and fingernails grow a month too.</br></br>  Pet shop's stand.  <br>me too dude</br>  <br>That's actually a pretty crappy stand, not gonna lie.<br><br>Iggy managed to beat it, and his stand was probably worse than Hermit Purple.</br></br></br>  King Crimsom would be the best for trolling.  <br>  worse than Hermit Purple <br><br>It can create sand clones, help you glide, etc.</br></br></br>  Probably a stand capable of physical recomposing or rearrangement like Sticky Fingers, Soft Machine, or Metallica. <br><br>Part V the bes.</br></br>  I'd like to have Metallica to fuck people up big time.  <br> worse that purple hermit  <br>Negroe please.</br></br>  Mandom.<br><br>Because fuck you</br></br>  <br>Hermit Purple's not great in Stand terms, but it's probably the best Stand a Ripple user could ask for. An extendable Ripple conduit that can bind enemies, pull you around like a grappling hook for mobility, wrap around you like armor for defense, and can even find your enemies for you or create maps.</br>  <br>this is why joseph had it.</br>  I want D4C so I can have anal myself.   mandom <br><br> the world <br><br> king crimson <br><br>any one of those will do, really</br></br></br></br></br></br>  No wait, Chocolate Disco. Super useful.  <br> can have </br>  <br><br>Once DIO is gone Joseph's stand gives him nigh omniscience as long as he looks in the right places. Plus it has long range and he can channel a ripple through it.<br><br>Iggy can float around and make sand bullshit. Sure he might be able to beat Joseph up, but it's only just slightly better at actually fighting.<br><br>Saying Iggy's is better because it's slightly better in a fight is like saying a spider is slightly stronger than an ant.<br><br>Not exactly a selling point, and Joseph's is still crazy better outside of combat.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Any time based Stand would be great</br>  The Ensemble of Shadows.<br><br>A stand similar to Star Platinum but made out of fog emanating a dark aura that automatically rots everything it touches or takes out the evil in one´s heart if they breath the air it rots.<br>Can also be used as a protective barrier and can solidify itself to fight or lift heavy things if needed but not as physically strong or fast as Star Platinum.</br></br></br>  <br>That stand is nothing like Star Platinum.<br><br>Why did you even mention Star Platinum? It served no purpose in describing your stand.<br><br>Also that stand sounds extremely edgy in that special "bad guy from kingdom hearts" kind of way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so all it can really do is lift things thats fucken gay</br>  <br>That stand is gayer than gay priest.</br>  <br>I meant like Star Platinum in the sense it has a form and literally stands behind me and that also has short range. Something like that.<br><br>And it´s more based in that bitch from Medaka Box that could rot everything she touches</br></br></br>  <br>Same for me, definitely Heaven's Door. It might not seem like the most powerful compared to ridiculous stands like The World, and King Crimson. But being able to write in rules would be the best.</br>  Alright, if I had a shitty fanfiction stand:<br> Revolution <br>Stand itself is short range punch ghost with 4 arms that spin around it.<br><br>Whatever it touches will revolve around on an orbit (Or simply rotate in place), the trajectory and speed of which is decided by how hard the stand slaps it.<br><br>The objects will revolve around me as if I were the 'sun' in a galaxy.<br><br>The orbit may be elliptical or whatever.<br><br>Not exactly great, but the stand itself would make for a pretty good asskicker and the ability itself does have some creative applications (I can make the wheels of my car spin without needing gas.) and at the very least it can be used to fling shit at people.<br><br> Revolution Number 9 <br>The evolved form for when I need to fight Diavolo. This form has has the ability to... I don't really know, I can't really think of anything original that's fucking OP without ripping off of C-Moon.<br><br>Obviously something to do with gravity though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Challenge for the thread:<br><br> Take two Stands which share one word of their names (Hermit Purple and Purple Haze, for example) and combine them and their powers into something new, then rename them. <br><br>That's it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like it. And there are a lot if gravity based stands anyway. C-moon just has most of their basic powers.</br>  <br>Highway Star Platinum<br><br>It's a remote Star Platinum that moves at 60km/h and kicks well<br> Am I doing this right? </br></br></br></br>  <br>C-Snake<br>Can steal the gravity from a object In the shape of a disc add that gravity to something else by inserting the disc.</br></br>  <br>Mine would be this:<br><br> 「Crazy La Paint」 <br><br>Power: B<br>Speed: B<br>Range: C<br>Staying: D<br>Precision: A<br>Potential: B<br><br>「Crazy La Paint」 appears as a vaguely humanoid entity, only just fitting the bill due to standing upright most of the time, though its build suggests that this would not be a natural pose in a real creature. Further de-anthropomorphising it is the fact that its entire body is composed of specific musical instruments - each limb is represented by an old-fashioned accordion, whilst its body, shoulders, and limb extremities are all composed of drums of various types, with the two shoulder pads also possessing piston-like devices that beat the two drums sequentially in a steady pattern; its fingers are flexible keys from a xylophone- or glockenspiel-like instrument, and its head is essentially a miniature pipe organ, like a scaled-down version of something one would see in a church moulded to form around the drum body, with the holes in the pipes acting as eyes.<br><br>「Crazy La Paint」 possesses the ability to induce "spin" in a target, represented by one of its limbs winding itself into a spiral for as long as needed, with stronger spin needing more wind-up time, then hitting a target to release that twisting into the target. Said spin can be utilised on both physical targets, either twisting the target's form up to and past the point at which the target breaks from the torsion or physically forcing them to start spinning round in a given plane of rotation at speed proportionate to wind-up, and on abstract or otherwise nonsensical concepts, for instance "twisting" a target's words to sound more convincing or "spinning" a literal web out of thin air as a spider would. Naturally, this has a lot of significant uses, but being made of constantly-sounding instruments makes stealth with this Stand totally impossible unless it is desummoned completely, which may hinder the user to a significant extent in many situations for one reason or another.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Shiieet I'm just beginning SBR, sorry I'm a hack guys.</br></br></br>  <br> Highway Star and Highway to Hell <br><br>This is an automatic stand that activates when the user dies. The stand pursues the target any distance in an attempt to kill the target in the same manner that the stand user died in. In doing so the user comes back to life if done within 24 hours. <br><br>Name? Sympathy for the Devil.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes<br><br>Close, but no Cigar.</br></br></br>  <br>Love it<br><br>I would have gone with C-Moon and Dark Blue Moon if I'm honest.</br></br></br>  <br> dark blue moon and C-moon <br>Basically a nerfed C-moon</br></br>  <br> Heirophant Green and Green Green Grass Of Home <br><br>This Stand is capable of unfurling itself into Tendrils that subject those pieced by them to Xenos paradox the further into the body the tendril penetrates. Its name is Savage Garden.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Shifty Stunts for Scant Shekels</br></br>  <br>So combing Dark Blue Moon with either C-Moon or Moody Blues nerfs the latter two horribly.</br>  <br>Stealing that for a JoJo RPG I'm running. Gonna be quite the shock for the players when this seemingly ordinary guy challenges them and actively tries to get himself killed by them.</br>  <br> Boy II Man and Mandom <br>Standard Boy II Man RPS game except instead of stealing power the winner takes time (life) from the loser. Maybe a week of their life or more and there is no limit to how many games it can play.<br>As for a name, 「I'D DIE FOR YOU」</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit that'd be a cool villain Stand.</br>  <br>The Lock+Jail House Lock would be terrifying though, wouldn't it?</br>  <br>sounds cool</br>  <br> Red Hot Magician <br>I'm fucking Cole Macgrath that has Storm Spirit for a stand. How fucking awesome is that?</br></br>  <br>Bretty rad</br>  <br> Green grass of home and green day. <br>A green and black humanoid stand with long black hair. The closer a living thing gets mold when begin to grow on their bodies and will rot them away until they distance themselves.<br>When punched by the stand they will be instantly reduced to nothing <br> Beautiful World </br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck..how would work.</br>  <br>Yeah go for it, the way I wrote it the user didn't necessarily have to be killed by the target but the closer they are the faster the stand would be able to pursue since it's on a clock. I imagined the user getting run over by a car then having the stand attempt to kill the target in a similar fashion.</br>  <br> Dirt Cheap Trick <br><br>Cheap Trick but with D4C dimension hopping.</br></br></br>  My stand would be one that manipulates time and simply removes moments of when my opponent or me did something, removing my mistakes or getting rid of my enemy's correct judgement. It will also be able to put scenarios that have made up in certain time slots in the past or future...Is tht too OP?  <br>*That I have made up</br>  My stand would be Crawling Skin. <br><br>Its would be some sort of horrible wormlike creature that burrowed underneath the flesh of its victims and drove them to screaming insanity.</br></br>  <br>Bloody hell<br> Cream and Cream Starter <br>Piranha manifests as a Spray can with what appears to be swimming fish on the sides, when the nozzle is squeezed it releases a stream of bruise-colored flesh-foam that will move to the largest piece of Organic material and begin consuming it and growing larger, Typically this flesh-foam will cling to surfaces without moving, but it can form its mass into limbs to pull consumables in.</br></br></br>  <br>You start having a Guilt Trip and can't remember why, which makes you guilty, you can see the end of this path, can't you?</br>  <br>There's no coming back from that. That's terrifying.</br>  <br>"tap that"<br><br>I get to read the mind of anyone I touch.</br></br></br>  <br>You have good taste. Crazy Diamond is easily the best Stand.</br>  <br>It's my favorite as far as design goes. It's a nice straight forward stand that takes some cleverness to master. Like I said I think it'd work well with how I am.</br>  <br>Hell, it's worse than the fusion of Lovers and Love Deluxe I came up with. And that is Strands of hair that detach from their users body, burrow into someone and replicate along their nervous system, and take control of them by firing off all of their pain receptors at once if they don't listen to the User.<br><br>Jojolion gave use a hell of a lot of combos for KC, didn't it?</br></br></br>  <br>Underhanded Undertakings for Unsatisfactory Wages</br>  <br>Shame train<br><br>The closer someone gets to me the fatter, uglier and bald(er) he gets. At punching range people would be unable to stand(hue). Being in the stands range causes the effect to slowly accumulate Has no further effects and can't attack at all. Yes this aplies to everyone: men, women, children, friend, foe, stands and even animals. <br><br> Always active <br><br> IRREVERSIBLE. <br><br> RANGE: S+ <br><br> Killing me makes the stand jump to the killer </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Weather Report<br>I can literally do anything</br></br>  <br>Does it just work?</br>  <br>you just described King Crimson.</br>  Drawn to the Blood, a punch ghost that lets me see vital things like runner vision. Whether it's weak points, paths or items etc etc. Bonus Points if it kind of looks like this  <br>How would you combine White Album and Whitesnake?</br>   「Hysteria」 <br><br>Everyone in range of the stand begins to go insane and start a riot. If you manage to leave the range of the stand, you slowly begin to regain your sanity</br></br>  King Crimson and just use Epitaph to be the world's best goal keeper.<br><br>Or Pearl Jam and be the best chef</br></br>  Weather Report or Gold Experience (non-requiem)  <br> Pearl Jam and be the best chef <br>If you want peoples organs to blow up and regenerate everytime they eat eat a dish then sure.</br></br>  <br>Rich folk would pay out the nose for my health boosting food</br>  Rocket Man.<br>Touch object, make it shoot off in a random direction.</br>  <br>So it makes sound every time you activate it? That sounds like a huge pain, and seems like it would be the exact opposite of my dream stand:<br><br> 「Shut Up and Let Me Go」 <br><br>Power: E<br>Speed: E<br>Range: A<br>Staying: B<br>Precision: C<br>Potential: C<br><br>Physically it would be similar to Hey Ya, in that it would be small enough to ride on my shoulders. It would have bubble-wand holes through its palms to create bubbles. It can then attach these bubbles to things, through which no sound can enter or leave.

He is like a edgelord "well stealing is like, a way of life man!"</br>  <br>Welcome to /a/, I would suggest learning more about our post etiquette before posting again.</br>  <br>go back to wikipedia and tumblr, since being an edgelord is more of their style there. Im sure you can relate to that more then you defending conmen who steals from children.</br>  <br>I was talking about you explaining who he was. Anybody who would even remotely care about your opinion on the matter would already have seen the anime and would know his character. There was literally no reason for you to explain it, which would seem to be a clue that you don't know how the discussion on 4chan works.<br>I don't give a shit about your opinion or the subject matter, it just irks me how incredibly redundant everything after the first sentence of your post was.</br></br>  <br>Nobody gives a shit about your opnion on the subject matter, so it seems calling you stupid is redundant, but in this case neccesary for you to understand. Those who havent seen it now knows it, and those who have can see it for how stupid he is, so I guess you can relate to that. I wonder if this guy also dresses up like a clown in makeup or is a thief himself?</br>  <br>No, your mistake is that you assume anybody gives a shit. We don't care how much you hate this guy. People who didn't know about him didn't give a shit. People who do know him don't give a shit. The only reason you've gotten any replies is me being a nice samaritan and telling you how 4chan unwritten rules about blogging works. We're not discussing the subject of your post, I'm discussing its nature.<br>However, I like the way you stylistically took my words and tried to turn them against me. It's always been something I've had fun doing myself.</br></br>  <br>Yes, your misstake is you assume anybody gives a shit about your opinion. "we" is your own. People dont care about your opinion and why only reply because you are hilariously entertaining for self made rules and your own blogging. people dont give a shit about your subject of your post, nor its nature.<br><br>Glad you admit you were wrong though, but if you can find any evidence or statistic to prove yourself correct feel free to do so. If not then go back to /tumblr/ and be a kiddie fiddler there. Or in this case a homosexual clown defender.</br></br></br>  <br>Ignore the shitposting troll. Nobody cares about his favorite edgelord philosophy bullshit, and people will not care about it now.</br>  <br>I am having a very hard time deciphering your post to be honest. What is up with your second sentence. How am I wrong, where did I admit anything, how can there even be evidence or statistics for what I claimed - the empiric evidence would be the entire history of 4chan posts.<br><br>Oh another thing. Just because a character is despicable and you severely dislike him, he can still be a good character.<br><br>Also, are you seriously implying that tumblr is the place for lolicons and not 4chan? Something must have severely changed on tumblr for that to be that. <br>Honestly, your post is just all over the place.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait a minute, he sounds like that scientology supporter guy. <br>Haha oh god! no wonder he likes childfiddlers and those who hurt children. SJW tumblr warriors tend to use their emotion rather then logic, this does explain his relation to horrible characters, in both the literal sense and whatnot.</br></br>  <br>Ah I see, I must have fallen for unsuspected bait.</br>  <br>He either likes trannies or boring monotone characters who are edgelords, but if he is a scientologist or a supporter of them, then it explains his philosophy bullshit about "its like, he is a guy who steals from people his ...his line of work man!"</br>  <br>He seems to hate logic aswell and is quite stupid for not giving any reason or sense over the defense of a boring edgelord clown.<br><br><br>Maybe he thinks (litterly in this case, since the conman steals from children) stealing candy from a baby is deep and heavy somehow?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>What the fuck is even going on now, why are you replying to yourself.</br></br></br>        <br>Bottom boy, its alright if you like other trannies, just calm down.

Fractionally speaking, I can't comprehend how you could like any other girl than her. The other girls are rationally dumb, Yui is a cramschool girl and Iroha would fit in a middleschool facebookgroup. Yukino is clever, rational, calm and very strong regarding leadership and helping out at things. The only thing she can't handle is herself, what makes her so cute and makes you want to help her. In the end the logically most sense making end would be Yukino and 8man because they both need each other like fish and water. Yukino needs 8mans straightforwardness and 8man needs Yukinos calm and  maybe a soft kiss too.<br/> <br>Just my 2 yens</br></br>    <br>Nobody asked for your shitty opinion!!! IROHA BEST FAGGOT XD</br>  <br> Yukino is clever, rational, calm and very strong regarding leadership and helping out at things <br><br>Lies.</br></br></br>  <br> awkward <br>That's because you're autistic, son.</br></br>  I am going to take a shit, and when I come back I want to see this as topcomment.  <br>I understand Yukino being a fish, but 8man is not like water.</br>  Where are my Yuki x Hachi smut  Am I the only one who noticed that Yui fell out of love with 8man during the end of vol 11?  <br> Yukino becoming shittier <br>That is humanly impossible.</br></br>  She reminds me of iroha.

Why hasn't he? Is he gay? I don't care if Yukino loves him too, Yui loves him more. Yui wants to be loved by him more too.</br>  <br>It doesn't matter who loves him more, who does Hikki like more?</br>  <br>He loves Yukiroha Yukigahama</br>  <br>He loves them about the same. That is why he should confess to them at the same time and tell them he loves them equally. They will be happy and there won't be drama.</br>  Yui theme<br>https://<span>youtu.be/UigzN-4JR14  [ ]</br>  Is OreGairu a SoL with an actual progressing plot or is it just "best girl of the day until the MC is forced to choose one" kinda shit?<br><br>I have it in my "maybelog", but I'm just not feeling it</br></br>  <br>It's been so long since I've heard this song.</br>  <br>Nah it's obviously going to be a friendzone end if anything</br>  Welp, this thread sure shows Irohafags are cancerous as ever.

I know that love is not based on merit but If Yukino wins, her win would have been achieved without having moved a finger:<br><br>1) Yui was pretty much sinking her own ship throughout vol. 11 because she didn’t want to be “unfair” to yukino. Furthermore, she was being considerate of Yukino and gave her chances to advance her relationship with 8man but she wasted them because of muh drama. To make matters worse, Yui will most likely get her heart crushed in vol. 12 in order to get 8man to understand that someone as wonderful as Yui can love him.<br><br>2) Iroha is teaching him how to be comfortable around girls and she is also teaching him how to be more open and conscious of a relationship (how 8man discovered that girls are sweet and spicy).<br><br>3) Sensei seems to want 8man to give yukino the genuine. Komachi, the cunt, (and haruno?) also seem to ship them and are actively trying to help them.<br><br>4) Haruno has been doing what she can to help Yukino get over her dependency issues. It is true that she can go about it in a nicer way, but who is to say that she hasn’t done so before and that only led to yukino taking advantage of that kindness and turning it into reliance.<br><br>5) Even though everyone is helping her, either indirectly or directly, she still has the audacity to ask 8man to help her some day.<br><br>6) When someone finally calls her out on her dependency issues, her only reply is:<br><br> Hurrr durrr, you are right, therefore I’m going to depend on you guys and make a request. <br><br>I know that by the end of the series she is going to get some character development which is going to prove that she is not dependent, but if she wins, her victory would have been attained by having everything handed to her. Everyone is doing their best to get Yukino and 8man together or to win the 8bowl for themselves; meanwhile, Yukino is too busy counting how many scratches the shoes of the people she talks to have.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't get it either, but looks like it's just waifu bait of the month</br>  <br>It's a meme show that appeals to everyone that enjoys suffering.</br>  <br><br><br>Oh look, the few remaining Yukinofags.</br></br></br>  <br>Yukinofags are shit but at least the remaining ones show that they aren't shipjumping scum.</br>  <br>I refuse to leave her no matter what happens.</br>  <br>Thank you for summing up how I feel. I am cringing every time I read Yukino's autistic behaviour in the light novel.</br>  <br>I'm always lurking, but never post. I just want to leave these threads. <br> tfw Yukinofag while liking the others master race </br></br>  <br>Same here. Whether it's a shit end or a good one, whether she gets accepted or not, I will refuse to leave her no matter what.</br>  <br>How does it feel being the minority after the secondaries left?</br>  <br>Feels indifferent.<br> &gt;yfw I'm also a secondary and have only ready S1's novels </br></br>  <br>As opposed to the small but rabid Irohafags, right? Please.</br>  <br>Don't do it.</br>  <br>Don't talk bull. The only fans that can rival Yukinofags are Yuifags, followed by Irohafags. Everyone else are small-time. But undoubtly, Irohafags are vocally most active. They can't stop posting like the zealous fans they are, especially now after the season ended. Most moved to lurking or to other shows of this season while keeping watch on Yahari threads from time to time. Not Irohafags though.</br>  <br/>  <br>In case you haven't realized, Yukinofags are a minority in these threads.</br>  <br>The shipjumpers probably have seasonal waifus too, they will try to come back when Yukino reaches final form but not support best girl when she's down</br>  <br>Since never.</br>  <br> minority after the secondaries left <br>the anime threads were Irohafag central, it's only now that Yukinofags are coming out of the woodwork</br></br>  <br>Whatever helps you sleep at night, anon.</br>    <br>I obviously weren't here for S1, most of Spyro's threads especially for volume 10, and most of S2 either. Don't even try. It's funny since anime secondary you claim are actually mostly Irohafags.</br>  I think Yukino and 8man look aesthetically perfect together. I want them to end up together really bad.  Can sensei and Rumi's time machine go back in time to the same timeline or do they change every time? Is it possible to store a time machine/take it apart and go into another time machine?<br><br>I'm pretty sure sensei and Rumi can take over the world by predicting possible futures using the time machine, I'm sure they can find out a way to take over the world/enslave 8man to be their sex slave.</br></br>  <br>Good lord.</br>  <br>You obviously*<br><br><br>Whatever helps you sleep at night, Irohafag.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Soon.</br>  <br>Not true and I don't know why you would even say that. As a Yukinofags, I was pretty active in pre-air and during S2 threads. Not a lot, but adequate. Now that the season is over and hype id dying, I shifted my attention to other series, but I still have Yahari threads on my watchlist and comment from time to time. I'm sure there are many Yukino fans that do the same.<br><br><br>I have the same thoughts.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The problem is aging. If they spend too much time in different timelines they're gonna be older.<br><br>But then maybe Rumi will have a chance with 8man even though she's his daughter, if it's not your father from the same timeline then it's not incest.</br></br></br>  <br> acting all proud pretending to have read a shitty fan tl of a trash twilight ripoff </br>  <br>You're in the wrong thread.</br>  When will her Hikki realize how much she genuinely wants him?  <br>When she finally says it.</br>  <br> Watching the series and not reading the LN <br>Stay plebe.</br></br>    <br>I just realized 8man is feeding her the coffee<br>that's cute</br></br>   “Oh, that reminds me. Hikigaya-kun. Wanna go out for tea with me if you’re free? I have to make sure you’re good enough to be Yukino-chan’s boyfriend.” Haruno-san threw out her chest and winked lightly in my direction. <br> “…how presumptuous. I said he was merely my schoolmate.” A harsh and severe voice like a North Pole blizzard cut in. It was the sound of a deeply felt reaction, one that was caused by Haruno-san’s joking tone and everything else about her. Yukinoshita had unleashed the ultimate rejection. <br> But Haruno-san brushed it aside this time with a cheeky smile. “I mean, it’s the first time I’ve seen you go out with someone, Yukino-chan. Isn’t it natural I’d think he was your boyfriend? I was happy for you.” Haruno-san let out a strange laugh that sounded like a snicker. “You’re a teenager, so you may as well have fun! Oh, but you better not be screwing, y’know?” <br> Jokingly, Haruno-san put her left hand on her hip and leaned over, her right index finger held up in warning. As she held that posture, she put her head close to Yukinoshita’s ears and whispered something softly. <br> “After all, Mother’s still mad over you living alone.” <br><br>Reminder that this is the real reason why Haruno moved in with Yukino. <br> :^) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Once Yukino fixes her problem with her family and they trust her enough to stay alone again, will she invite 8man to her apartment for a 1 on 1 tutoring session?<br>Will she wear her most modest clothes for him and tease him until he isn't able to resist?</br></br>    <br> isn't able to resist <br>Isn't able to resist what?

I like 8man mostly because I thought a lot of similar things. Fuck, some I still do. I'm at a point in life where I convince myself to not expect anything from anyone, ever. So it's kinda refreshing for me seeing a main character fighting with and against very similar thoughts.<br><br>There is much more development in it than your run of the mill romcom.
