[ "IT" has a horse pussy. Very disgusting.<br><br><br>Even more disgusting than horse is bird.<br><br>Birds shits, pee and lay eggs from the same hole. Ultra disgusting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I pity you.</br>  Jesus Christ there are already two monmusu threads up. What the fuck are you even doing  <br>Technically a cloaca would be like anal.<br><br>Snakes also have a cloaca, as would a fish. <br>Slimes would be just stick it in wherever because it is all the same consistency or could at least become so.<br>Spiders have a kind of vagina-like structure called an epigyne, but it looks like pic related and sperm gets there by hand</br></br></br></br></br>   not liking best girl <br><br>I wanna brush her rump</br></br>  <br>i do like her but she wont be here until next week.</br>  <br> those little fish limbs </br>  Does she have two pussies?<br>She's covering the front bottom.</br>  <br>no she just does.</br>  <br>  those creepy little fish arms <br>Why?</br></br>    <br> those little fish limbs <br><br>Cute as hell.</br></br></br>  <br><br>she needs them for stuff</br></br>  <br>So do I, anon. Cerea is love.</br>  Why are mods deleting horse pussy threads?  <br> You're fine with eating fish <br> Humans eat beef and pork. It's like that. <br><br>Mmm, long pig.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>When the same threads keep popping up with the same content in the OP, it starts being being spam. Or general threads. Either way, cancer.</br>  <br> being being </br>  <br><br>Not a surprise. There are carnivorous fish that primarily dine on lower fish species. Sharks, for example.</br></br>  <br>He's shitposting. Welcome to 4chan I guess, are you the summer faggot that keeps whining over too many threads on the same material?</br>  <br>You haven't heard of Being Spam? It's the hot new shitpost.</br>  What a bitch. How can anyone like this disgusting animal?  <br>I can't be on [s4s] 100% of the time. I do other NEET activities; like working out.</br>  <br><br>Was a pragmatic suggestion in universe. I wish they'd have explored the relation in the monster realm about slimes and other non-humans or non-demi-humans and how they're perceived. It seems like slimes are treated as no different than dumb animals there.</br></br>  I wonder what centaur tastes like.<br><br>Also I had a dream where harpies were treated like wild animals and people would hunt them for food and cook only the human torso part.<br><br>The problem is some poachers and really bad people would mix in actual human torsos in the harpy meat supply and no one could tell the difference. It was considered a good way to cover up a murder.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's so disappointing that you can't fondle her breasts and enter her at the same time. Even if I were okay with horsepussy, you have to chose between giving attention to her upper half or lower half as they're about four or five feet away from each other.</br></br>  <br>That's pretty fucked up mang.</br>  <br> It's not actually a meme I'm just covering up my embarrassing typo I hope you realize that </br>  <br> I did. Feel less shame in knowing that. Blaming new memes on [s4s] is too easy because they have new memes ever hour. </br>  <br>cut off the upper half, place near the back end</br>  She's Daijoubu  <br><br> plz remove disgusting dispray of understanding and camaraderie </br></br>  <br>i assume she also has horse breast</br>  <br>You are not into bestiality, I see.</br>  <br> that shit quality. <br><br>When forced to choose between quality and image dimension, always pick dimensions to shrink.</br></br></br>  <br> Never. I'll bring /tg/ to /a/ if it sends me to Gensokyo. </br>  SOON.  <br>Jesus christ. I just googled horse udders and immediately regretted it.<br><br>This scene is now creepy as shit to me.</br></br></br>   horse pussy <br> disgusting <br><br>Sorry, but have you seen a horse pussy?<br><br>It's probably the closest analog in the animal kingdom to a human vagina. Except it's way bigger, way deeper, and squeezes harder.<br><br>If a hot centauress was waving that shit around I'd make some bad fucking decisions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Careful man, being friendly is one thing, but /a/ hates other boards better ones like /tg/   </br>  <br> It's probably the closest analog in the animal kingdom to a human vagina <br>Nah, that's sheep.</br></br>   my dick when suu spoke   Does anyone else think this show would be better if the girls weren't monsters?<br><br>Like, it was just 4-5 girls living in a big house all dating Darling-kun with the intent of marrying him?</br></br>  Even more disgusting are humans. <br><br>They use the same slimy hole filled with tiny parasites to consume corpses AND show affection to their loved ones. <br><br>When they are happy (or trying to threaten someone) they open that rotten hole and bare a set of pointy objects meant for ripping and mincing.</br></br></br></br>  How flexible is she? <br><br>If she could curve her horse body in a v shape, then lean her human body backwards, a human might be able to make out with, fondle, and enter a centaur all at the same time. Just like they would with a human woman.</br></br>  <br><br>How does she wipe her ass when she shits?</br></br>  <br>It would be the same shit. Literally the same shit, nothing would be different other than HOW they hurt Darling.  It would have to take place somewhere like Saudi Arabia though, so the women would have to go outside accompanied by Darling or a male escort. </br>  is there a translation for the slime species screen yet?<br><br><br>No, go fuck yourself, there are literally a thousand shows like that already.</br></br></br>  <br> that baby horse <br>you have no one to blame but yourself.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, check the archive for previous threads. I saw one around 2PM pacific I think.</br>  <br>found it quick, thanks</br>  <br>Some of them genuinely look like a brown girl's breasts, but really hairy and with extremely long nipples. It's fucking nightmarish.<br><br>Cerea, I'm sorry.</br></br></br>  <br> Some of them genuinely look like a brown girl's breasts, but...with extremely long nipples. <br><br>What part of this sounds bad?</br></br></br>  <br>Are you doing this to flare my autism?</br>  <br>holy fuck, pink slime please</br>  <br>yes they are disgusting,but<br> lay eggs </br></br>  <br>puffy pussy</br>  <br> that thumb <br>Hang on. I don't understand her anatomy. <br>Are harpies part bird, or do they have bat wings, but with feathers?</br></br></br>  <br>More like pseudo-hands. She's got a thumb of sorts, and can grip things, but she doesn't have a proper hand.</br>  <br>Artist was shit. I don't imagine he intended for them to function like mittens, but that's what they are now.</br>    <br><br>I feel like Centaur's Worries had a much less disgusting explanation for this.</br></br>  Cerea Worries crossover when?!  <br>How's a magic sphincter disgusting. People would pay money to have one genetically added</br>  <br>I more meant that the explanation itself was grossing me the fuck out, not the fact that it's a sphincter that works really well.</br>  <br>Maybe when CW becomes poplar<br>i.e. never</br></br>  <br>mmm, pulsating overlapping sphincter control</br>  <br> Artist was shit. I don't imagine he intended for them to function like mittens, but that's what they are now. <br>In the end the decision was to let Papi grasp things. Having characters with no legs is one thing, but no hands is another matter that would cause difficulties.</br></br>  <br>she's a Deep One. gotta go Deep</br>  <br>  ;___;  </br>  How does Cereal wipe her ass?  <br>Much better now.</br>  <br>With a clean cloth, and a stick.</br>  <br>Hi, /co/  or possibly /v/. </br>  <br>Did you read/watch the manga/anime? Cerea said it herself.</br>    <br>dolphins are still better</br>  <br>I'm team Miia, but Cerea's not a bad choice. <br><br>Also, if the BR/DVD doesn't have that goddamn shedding scene (or if it doesn't magically appear in the next episode or as an extra or something) I'm petitioning another goddamn Fatman be dropped on those fucking Nips.</br></br></br>  <br>please enlighten a non-mangafag fellow anon, what is the shedding scene</br>  <br> Miia burns her hand while trying to cook a meal for darling. Because of this, she can't shed her skin on her own which is a very personal act for a Lamia, especially when you recall that stimulating the tip of her tail can make her orgasm. Darling helps her out and everything is going okay until he remembers he has to remove the skin near her vagoo. Miia becomes more embarrassed and uses her tail to keep Darling from seeing her sensitive spot. This leads to Darling accidentally fingering her, prompting a shocked Miia to involuntarily snap Darling's neck. </br>  <br>  Read the manga.  </br>  <br>So you'd never do anal?</br>  <br>I'd a Cerea ass.</br>  <br>rip darling. any chance you know what chapter it is?</br>  <br>On the contrary, I'd pound that flank like there's no tomorrow.</br>  <br>nvm found it</br>  <br>It's been a while, but it's one of the earlier ones, like right around or before they meet Suu.</br>  <br> that music that played when suu was introduced </br>  <br>Well that explains Wales</br>  <br>And New Zealand.</br>  <br> Nice! <br>Crab is too based.</br></br>  <br>They need that scene to explain Miia's shedded skin that she kept in the laying egg chapter though.<br>But who knows, maybe they'll skip that part too.</br></br>  <br><br><br>I bet her reactions to her first asspounding would be both delicious and cute.</br></br></br>  <br>All I know is that Mero would be best girl either way.</br>  Rachnee being drunk of caffeine is a confirmed biological fact right? Are spiders really supposed to get wasted on the stuff?  <br>Can you guys stop? There's way too much blood rushing to my dick right now.</br>  <br>what about shark grills</br>  <br>qt sharks are great.</br>  <br>All?</br>  <br>fag.</br>  <br>How much do I have to pay to get a finjob with her pelvic fins?</br>    <br>So Red, Green and Black Slimes are unfuckable? Why would anybody like a non pink or standard one.</br>  <br><br>Crab genuinely loves what he does.<br><br>Monster Musume may be ecchi harem shit of the most obvious variety, but it's a labor of love and every panel shows it.</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  monster girls are disgusting  <br>no u</br>  <br>Not really look at the art from the first few chapters where hewent all out and compare them to the most recent ones. Not only did he get lazy as he went on but he also hasn't improved much at all since his webcomic days.</br>  <br>LSD is surprisingly good.</br>  <br> They breathe water through their gills. <br>At least do your research crabman</br></br>    <br>He's probably just some up his own ass prick that can't eat eggs because "where they come from". Fucking stupid.</br>  <br> what is couples yoga. </br>    <br>There's that one image on the boorus where Cerea and Hime bump tips, but that's about it.</br>  <br>BRB Gotta go to Kurusu's house to lend him a jetpack before shit's start going down with Murderfish</br>  <br>Imagining her facial expressions and grunts as you slowly bottom out in that huge rump, feeling your hips mashed against hers does that to me too.</br>  <br>fuck you, cunt. mares winking at you with their beautiful vaginas when they're in heat is a natural wonder of the world, and deserves to be respected</br>  <br>Not him, but not fond of assplay. Straight vanilla for me, while she repeatedly slams my balls with that winking clit.</br>  I haven't read the manga in ages. is there a werewolf yet?  <br>no.</br>  <br>well thats disappointing. someone get ahold of me when theres a cute wolf girl making awoos</br>  <br>There's a cute kobold girl if that tickles your fancy.</br>    <br>thats ok I guess.</br>  <br> mares winking at you with their beautiful vaginas <br> Natural wonder of the world <br>Not that i have anything against horse pussy and Cerea,but the "wonder of the world part" obliterated my sides to oblivion.</br></br></br>  <br>Oldschool kobold. As in dog person. Speaking of that, how did the kobold transition from dog people to jew lizards?</br>  <br>You want disgusting? Lamia is over 7m long. 5.5-6 of those meters are constantly dragged through the streets. Those same 5.5-6m then coil around you in bed. A bath before sex might help, I guess, but she still has to drag that into your home. Or wrap around your neck when she wants to drag you somewhere.<br> But the streets of Japan are clean! <br>What about public restrooms? Even if she herself doesn't go in them(or like that MS Paint an anon drew illustrated, she simply lifts her tail tip all the way to the bowl to empty her cloaca), other people drag those same restroom germs onto the streets, where she picks them up. A Lamia waifu would be a germophobe's ultimate nightmare.</br></br></br>  <br>Someone liked lizards more I guess</br>    Discuss.  <br>Check the archive, there's nothing left to talk about.</br>  Its a boring 3 min clip that has no meaning. <br><br>/thread</br></br>  Blu-rays when?  <br>  Dat moment when you realize the internet has ruined your life... </br>  <br> Lol tits wtf Japan so random!! <br>Casuals  like OP  flocked to this and ruined it. You should be ashamed if you didn't know about animator expo before Me!Me!Me! was released.<br>This thread is bait.</br></br></br>  Lewd and psychedelic. That's it.<br><br>Some people like to get into convoluted arguments on whether or not it was call-out at the otaku lifestyle, but who cares.<br><br>Also loved Chronic, I listen to it on a daily basis.</br></br></br></br>  It bothers me that the actual song flows so horribly when it doesn't have the quiet moments between the genre-switches  <br>Cool animation and story, but shite music tbh.</br>  <br><br>But that's the best part, it's fast paced and over-the-top/right-in-your-face all the time, maximalist if you will, almost Baroque.</br></br>  <br>On the plus side, it makes listening to one part  pic related  repeatedly and skipping the rest all that much easier, since there's nothing leading into it.</br>  <br>Don't get me wrong, I like the individual parts quite a lot, but with how little time is spent on each part and how jarring the shifts are for the most part it makes it hard to listen to<br><br><br>This is probably my favorite part. Either that or the second part.</br></br></br></br>  ME!ME!ME!?<br>More like MEME MEME MEME. Shit sucks; about as deep as a kiddie pool.</br>  <br><br>Just think about it as a glorified music video, the song as a whole makes more sense without the animation IMO.</br></br>  <br>A malignant virus that killed the anime industry.</br>  <br>What's there to discuss?<br><br>What was even there to discuss in the first place?<br><br>How sex sells even without a plot? We knew that all along.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How sex sells even without a plot? We knew that all along. <br>There was a plot and this animation wasn't 'sold' to people. Seems like all your eyes saw was sex rather than all the symbolism.</br></br>  <br><br>Not really, it went viral and people started to fuss about it in the social networks, but it died out pretty quick like most virals.<br><br>For the most part the shitstorm stayed between the boundaries of the normie nets.

She wouldn't take the game too seriously, but I could see her being really good at it without any explanation.  She probably runs the JASA already. </br>  <br>Why are they making her chop onions with a mouse hat on?</br>  <br><br>Would using Fairies as Astronaughts offer any real savings on resources? Can you build a tiny space shuttle for them to blast off in?</br></br>  <br>How are they all sitting in the grass on their backs?

I don't know how well they could handle g-forces, but it would leave more room for fuel and experiments.  The main benefit is cuteness. </br>  <br> Can you build a tiny space shuttle for them to blast off in? <br><br>You could probably attach them to a high-flying aircraft and launch them that way.<br><br>Problem is they'd likely burn up on re-entry.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think she wanted to help cut the onions but didn't realize they would make her cry. Miia and Darling are having a hearty chuckle at the situation.</br>  <br>But vertically from the horse body so they make a straight line?</br>  <br> uncomfortable <br>Only for her back. And prudes.</br></br>  <br>Like bending forwards at the waist to pick something off the ground.</br>  <br>I don't see why not.</br>  <br>That doesn't explain the hat</br>  It would be cute if someone was given three catgirls to look after.  <br><br>I've never seen a centaur in fiction do that. Seems uncomfortable based on their shape.</br></br>  <br>Why does the hat need to be explained?</br>  <br> And prudes. <br><br>I think anyone would be careful around a 10 year old with D cups, anon.<br><br>Would be funny if she made the schoolteachers get self-conscious about their own size, though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe she likes to wear silly hats?</br>  <br>It seems out of place.</br>  <br> It would be cute if someone was given three catgirls to look after. <br><br> Ms. Smith is forced to look after three cat-girls <br> Bike Cop gets an overeager, overqualified Wolf-Girl fresh out of the police academy. <br><br><br><br>Are you suggesting Mini Miia is a touhou?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tell me.

Ms. Smith taking care of catgirls is hilarious. </br>  <br><br>What's that thing around Darling's neck? Just a nifty necklace, or something that has significance in Lamia culture?<br><br><br><br><br>The baby isn't brain damaged she's just airheaded okay?<br><br>Just cuz she isn't the smartest doesn't mean she's the dumb.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Try pouring Suu down your Daughteru's ear because Suu fixes everything </br></br>  <br><br><br> on Miia's and Mero's date to the aquarium  <br> Miia also wore a silly fish-hat at the gift shop  <br>It's all fucking coming together.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The second one is a tv series in the making. <br><br> One's a goofy veteran who knows the beat and the street <br> The other's a tough ace who plays by the rules <br> Together they fight crime   and go on walkies. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even as slime, the black is edgy.</br>  <br>DEEPEST</br>    <br><br>Black isn't edgy, it's tragic.</br></br>  <br>Would you take a wolfu  out for a walk? What if her idea of a walk was like Polt's idea of light exercise? </br>  <br> you'll never buy stupid hats for your monster family. </br>    <br><br> You'll never buy stupid hats for your monster family   because they weave them for free </br></br>  <br><br>I'd go for those walkies because the pay-off is worth it, dammit, I'll go for those walkies and at the end give her a headrub for being a good girl.<br><br> Who's a good girl? You are! Yes, you are! <br><br>Also I don't know how Kobolds are supposed to work, but many varieties of dog or wolf are pretty damn lazy. They love their walks sure, but after working on-foot I imagine a policewoman wolf-girl would want nothing more than to  lay on the couch and watch TV or read in a tank top and boy shorts, even if you were sitting there first. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> dark/satirical comments <br> violent and hostile <br> black and red <br> not edgy </br></br></br></br>  <br>The class president in Centaur Worries had triplet catgirl sisters to take care of.</br>  Just got around to watching the episode. Suu is too god damned cute. Can't wait for full sentences.  <br>Mechanically, not particularly different from a horse nodding their head to eat grass.<br><br>Someone wrote a paragraph about a kindergarten teacher sobbing in a closet when she saw the minotaur, oni and centaur girls.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Innocent, childlike, slime minding its own business <br> Gets toxic waste poured into it <br> Now has no control over its actions <br><br>I just want to hug it better.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>An anon on /tg/ made a setting where Centaurs and Humans co-evolved that sort of explains how they're so flexible.<br><br> And also how their genitalia grew or shrunk to accommodate their new potential lovers or spouses. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Horse heads don't ever go perpendicular to their body though. Not living ones anyway</br>  <br>So Minia will be cucking a Nezumi?</br>  <br>Your wolfu would be lucky to have you!  I would too. I generally don't like long walks, but with her it would be worth it. <br><br>Would she make a cute argument about why she needs the couch, or lay herself across you and grab the remote?  What she really wants is to be close to you. </br></br></br>  <br>If you've ever done a full 90° Japanese-style bow(chinbeards excused), it's like that. Except I guess since they're lying back, it's a bit more like the leg-raising exercise, or they twist their lower body to the side. Either way, lewd as fuck for anyone looking at the right time.</br>  <br><br> You come home from a long trip to the store <br> She sounds bored and disinterested <br> Even though her tail is thumping on the couch </br></br></br></br>  <br> But vertically from the horse body so they make a straight line? <br>It is pretty obvious they would have extra vertebrates thus allowing the human part to twist very far. And especially consider the possibility that centaurs likely have next to no organs in their human stomach, that can be a justification.</br></br>  I hereby renounce, on this day, my fagship to Rachnee. After reading the manga again, I hereby state my allegiance and love now is towards Miia.<br><br>She is the only proper girl for darling. Forgive me, but I need not your words for I have found the best.</br></br>  Can't wait for Suu vs Kii.  <br><br> Suu vs. Kii <br> Suu <br> Kii <br> Suu Kii <br> SuuKii <br> Suki </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tio is no slut. <br> She's a pure girl. <br>Yeah, that's pretty much canon. When Doppel did the gag with Manako's name Tio was confused. She didn't understand dirty jokes.<br><br>One element about Tio is that she is basically a little girl, loving sweets, animals, and frill dresses, in a very tall and strong body.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Tio is an Oni, right?<br><br>Just give the girl some alcohol and watch her turn into a pushy asshole.<br><br>Also  you will never make the 7 meter girl into a 7 meter woman. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Tio is huge but she's not 7 meters, she's 7.5 *feet.*</br></br>  <br>Would you bone the wolfu if she begged?  By that I mean taking her to an expensive restaurant where one of the courses is a bone with cooked marrow. </br>  <br>They're Papi and the Suu<br>Yes Papi and the Suu<br>One is a birdbrain<br>The other's made of goo<br>They are two monster girls<br>Their genes made twists and twirls<br>They're happy, they're Papi and the Suu, Suu, Suu, Suu<br>Suu, Suu, Suu, Suu, Suu</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why is she such a cute Kobold? <br>She is almost too perfect. The only reason it worked in the story is because she is basically a plot device. Polt is the nice girl friendly with everyone and helps you whenever you asked. She is rich, works hard despite her wealth, and does community service on the side.<br><br>If anything such a person would be hard to approach romantically.

They straight up used the theme song. Toei's gonna get them.  Reminiscing Season 1 Edition<br><br>Still waiting for Season 3, but lets talk about why this series was so appealing in the first place.</br></br>  Gateway anime of the worst kind.  <br>I think Haruhi appealed to me in the first place, because of two central themes The first being, "The extraordinary becoming the ordinary."<br><br>The Haruhi series is extraordinary, with its aliens, time travellers and espers. But Haruhi doesn't know about their existence. And in Haruhi's perspective, the everyday is the same, and Life is a futile chase after something that is 'not there'. In contrast to Kyon's POV, he sees the things that Haruhi had created but, and as extraordinary as it was, it has become normal to him, partly because said agents want to keep the status quo, and partly because he wnats to get too involved.<br><br>I think that, for me, is why Haruhi stands out. A series that tries to blend fantasy with slice of life either have the fantasy as something that doesn't gel well with the ongoing circumstance (Evangelion comes to mind), or the fantasy is one big cover up while normal lives are ongoing (like Shakugan no Shana and Fate/Stay night). But In Haruhi, especially from Kyon's perspective, the fantastic is actually out in the open - its just that its creator cannot visibly see it.<br><br>It reminds me of NieA_7 for some odd reason. In that anime, an alien landing had become so accepted, life became mundane. In Haruhi's world, time travel, aliens and espers are possible but, and because its so well hidden, Haruhi is not aware of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The other themes, thats central to both Haruhi &amp; NieA_7, is the point of existence, and the meaning of life.<br><br>Although we don't know what Haruhi did, exactly, that gave her the powers that she had, we know ''why' she developed them. It was because of the supposed futility and meaninglessness of the individual existence. Its also why she embarks on her seemingly pointless quest: because she wanst to experience the extraordinary.<br><br>Its not a new theme: NieA did explore that. But Haruhi does it better because it actually shows how one can make a difference in their lives, by doing something so recognizable that people would not easily forget it (rememebr Live Alive?) NieA only glances at it, Haruhi actually explores it.<br><br>This comes full circle in the movie: Kyon' resented the life that he ahd lived within the SOS Brigade. But, when a normal life without it was offered to him, Kyon rejected it. Why?<br><br>Because, what point is there in life if everything was so simple? Life was definitely more interesting and exciting when the conflict was there. Its like how Mayuko came to value NieA a lot more after she disappeared - the parallel was the same for Kyon when he lost Haruhi in his life.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  A lot of series start out with a great, interesting premise, then have horrible development because the author never planned anything to get revealed.<br><br>Haruhi spreads out the exposition of its premise over its entire run, so the slice-of-life bullshit looks like it's hinting at something the viewer doesn't know.</br></br>  <br>I think thats the tragedy with the Haruhi franchise.<br><br>But that doesn't mean it had a great start. Its a series that kept you guessing initially, and the Sasaki arc showed what could really be done with it.<br><br>A shame Tanigawa ran out of steam.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Freeman's Kyon carried the series</br>  <br>Tanigawa too.<br><br>I liked both voice actors. Tanigawa is an incredibly adept voice actor, and I love his rendition of Joseph Joestar. Hell, Tanigawa is, for me 'the' vocie of Kyon.<br><br>But Freeman is not slakcing it and, if I have to listen to Haruhi in english, I have to go with Kyon.<br><br>Plus those bloopers:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=iRO<wbr>2fBxRU3M</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_8p<wbr>u59pFyNU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He might continue yet. One can dream anyway can't they</br>  <br>I guess you're right.<br><br>I just hope Tanigawa gets out of his creative block.<br><br>The real question, is if anyone will still be interested in Haruhi again if it ever makes a revival.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If it's really soon, maybe since the ending of Yuki-chan at the very least made the series current, even if it was just a not so extraordinary spin off. If it's years later, I doubt most people but the hardcore fans will care much. On 4chan it might generate hype at least</br>  <br> why this series was so appealing in the first place. <br><br><br>Pretty fucking easy. <br><br>First, this https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Gwu<wbr>nJgLsm5U</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Followed by a well articulated monologue about the viability of Aliens, Time Travelers, and Espers in a likeable and sarcastic tone of voice.<br><br>The rest is history....</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  season 3 pls ;_;  <br> why this series was so appealing <br><br>Interesting characters<br>interesting premise<br>The character interactions were good.<br>God tier OPs, EDs and OST<br>KyoAni<br> Key eyes <br>Kyon's monologue/narrating<br>Good dialogue<br>Haruhi<br>Aya"Not fucking the bassist"Hirano<br>The island episode<br>Haruhi's ponytail<br>Aya Hirano<br>Mikuru<br>The fang<br>Koizumi and Kyon's banter<br>Asakura<br>Add whatever the fuck you want because everything in this show/movie is fantastic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>WITNESS</br>  <br>I don't understand this meme, please explain it.</br>  <br> The fang </br>  <br>Pls watch Mad Max then.<br>You won't be disappointed.</br></br>  <br>I did watch it and I still don't get it.</br>  <br>You don't remember the "going to Valhalla" and everyone screaming "witness!"?

At least Bateman shitposting isn't as high anymore.</br>  <br>That's it? I was expecting something more convoluted.</br>  <br> Still waiting for Season 3 <br>the author will die before he publishes another ln, let alone sees an anime adaptation again</br></br>  <br>Maybe we'l get lucky since Haruhi anime turns 10 next year. Who knows it might be the glorious return of Haruhiism.</br>  Why only season one?<br>The second season was also splendid tbh</br>  This has killed the franchise for me.    I miss this Asakura.  <br> Tanigawa <br><br>uhh anon</br></br></br>  <br>You have to admit Yuki-chan Asakura is pretty fucking good too.</br>  <br>MEDIOCRE!</br>  <br>Doubles are usually a sign of truth.</br>    <br>No, they aren't.</br>  <br> Haruhi anime turns 10 next year <br><br>Shit, this makes me feel fucking sad as hell.</br></br></br>  <br>This.</br>  HQ Version: https://d.maxfile.ro/gwuaqclpws.web<wbr>m</wbr>  <br>Why?<br><br>That Haruhi can remain relevant up till now is kind of something.</br></br></br>  "Haruhi was a mistake."<br><br>- Tanigawa Nagaru</br></br>  <br>Well it's been so long and there's no hope in sight for more Haruhi from a novel and anime perspective. Even if it does happen it won't be the big thing it was 10 years ago because most people moved on. Just feels like a lot of wasted potential that should have been capitalized more on. There's nothing you can do about Tanigawa but at least we should've gotten more anime since there was enough for another 2 seasons maybe even 3.</br>  <br>I dunno. We got two anime series, a movie, 3 spinoffs and so on.<br><br>To me, haruhi was my anime. I hated and still hate Eva, but Haruhi was my godsend.<br><br>And the fact we have threads about it is saying something. Madoka was flavour of the year. But haruhiism remains strong.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's an actually well done harem. I don't care for haremshit but this series managed the pull me in.<br><br>this sums up what's great about it. It also in a limited S1 run to accomplish so many things that some anime will take seasons to build up to</br></br></br>  <br>Its both harem and not harem. Thats whats so great about it.<br><br>Also itsukyon is best ship.</br></br></br>  I still wish that Aya Hirano's career will rise again.  <br> itsukyon <br>nigga why</br></br>  Itsuki harem  <br>Cos im a dirty fujoshi.<br><br>:^)<br><br>(No really)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We need more Itsuki hentai.</br>  <br>Would have made more sense if all the girls were after itsuki's dick</br>  <br>i thought this episode was pretty funny</br>  <br>Episode 0 was one of the best, although I don't know why people recommend watching it before the rest of the series.</br>  <br>The story of harui pretty roughly follows episode 0.<br><br>It also works as a teaser. Its hammy, but then you watch the series and realize that everything in episode 0 IS true.</br></br></br>  <br>It will.</br>  <br>For me though it was much funnier watching episode 0 once you knew the characters.</br>  Starling Inferno !!  <br>True.<br><br>I guess the best watching order differs per person.</br></br></br>  I still have emotional scars from Endless Eight.

Didn't start browsing /a/ until 07 so I missed out on being on the 'ground floor' so to speak so I just skipped the anime. <br>Read the books as they were released in English, finished Disappearance, watched the anime, continued with books.<br>I liked the books because they were easy slice-of-life novels to read that also had strong science fiction elements. Plus, Kyon is a great character with interesting views on the world around him.<br>I liked the anime because it was like the books and Haruhi is fine as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry, but could you elaborate on what you said about the Sasaki arc? I recently finished reading the LNs, but they didn't leave much of an impact on me.</br>  <br>Think of it as Haruhi taking on an equal.<br><br>And Haruhi having to create a proxy to defeat her equal.</br></br></br>  Anyone here good at video editing?  When i get home ill do an image dump.  <br>For what purpose?<br><br>There's  and  for that.</br></br></br>  <br>Who said we cant dump here as well?</br>  Why do we have 2 threads right now?  We need a season 3.<br><br>Just for yasumi.</br></br>  Would you watch a spin off where Haruhi, not Kyon, was the main character?  <br><br>It would be great to see things from her perspective</br></br>  <br>Its much more efficient to dump on /c/, because the thread will live much longer and others will also contribute more.</br>  <br>Hurry up already<br><br> /r/ing Yuki pics pls </br></br></br>  <br>would you a fang?</br>  <br>Trips confirm a fang.</br>  <br>Your damn right i would!</br>  Why are we asking so many questions?  <br>when will there be season 3?<br><br><br>also you're*</br></br></br></br>  What is the meaning of life?  How can my feet smell if they don't have a nose?  Why does she sit like that?  <br>I sometimes wish the show was Suzumiya, but with a whole male harem.</br>  I'm sure someday I'll watch this anime but I do not know when that day will be.  Post prayers.  <br>Why</br>  <br>They say Haruhiism is a religion.<br><br>So pray.</br></br></br>  <br> edition <br><br>Kill yourself, cancer.</br></br></br>  <br>No you anon. You're the cancer</br>  <br>And then anon was the cancer.</br>  Who should remake Haruhi?  <br>Xebec</br>  <br> Madhouse <br> Deen </br></br>  <br>Shaft</br>  100 posts.<br><br>Not bad.</br></br>  <br>Based post.</br>  <br> because most people moved on <br><br>First, I don't see how you can even support that, so it's an inherently invalid statement. Secondly, even if it was valid, people who loved Haruhi, but "gave up," would most likely still watch it if S3 was released, because why the fuck wouldn't they?</br></br></br>  <br>Agreed. I know id watch</br>  <br>David productions</br>  Warner brothers  Seaseon 3rd ep1 [Love at First Sight ]  <br>If only.</br>    <br><br>S1 S2 Yukichan?</br></br>  <br>Haruhi Season 1 &amp; Churuya &gt; Endless Eight &gt; Yukichan &amp; Haruhichan</br>  <br>S1 S2 Nyoro-n Tsuruya-san</br>  <br>Fuck you nyoron is awesome</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=inh<wbr>mkcgqN3M</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Best Episode.</br></br>  And at the end, which studio did this?  http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/vi<wbr>ew/433773<br><br>In memoriam.</br></br></wbr>  Is it lewd in here? Cause all Haruhi threads need a bit of lewd.    my worst fear is dying before s3  <br>Is this the part where I get a bunny girl Haruhi lap dance or do I get tied up and beaten to a pulp?</br>  <br>Why do you think any of that would happen?</br>  <br>Same reason I still believe season 3 will still happen.</br>  <br>I still believe too, anon.</br>  <br>I want to saaki Sasaki's Sasakis.</br>  <br>I don't get why Haruhi is often called a harem, Mikuru clearly see Kyon as a friend and Nagato is an alien.</br>  <br>Girls will drop most friendships if there's no possibility of sex.</br>  <br>What</br>  <br>Mikuru probably wants to fuck Kyon but can't act on it due to professionalism, and Nagato wants to fuck Kyon but doesn't know how to act on it/knows he wouldn't do it anyway.<br> Sasaki wanted to but Kyon was too dense or didn't want to so she moved on. <br><br> Koizumi's up for interpretation. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Itsukyon is best</br>  <br>I still believe Koizumi has a huge thing for Haruhi and his hearts breaks a little more each day knowing he can never be with her.</br>  <br>Is this from a doujin?</br>  <br>Yeah it's called Bliss I believe. Also I wonder if Haruhi is a virgin or not.</br>  <br><br>Pretty sure she went completely apeshit on every one of those "boyfriends" if they even suggested anything sexual. They're not aliens after all</br></br>  <br> First, I don't see how you can even support that, <br><br>Yuki-chan sales, despite it being a spinoff it's still part of the Haruhi franchise. Contrary to popular belief it's not because Otaku hate it, they just don't care as much about Haruhi anymore.<br><br>I realize people who love Haruhi would watch it still, but it won't pull in as many BDs as it did when it first came out. It won't be the big money maker it was implying a lot of people moved on from the series.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Were the Yuki-chan sales that bad? I never got to see the final numbers.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ERU<wbr>Jam6N1Yk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Krv<wbr>jVMxSi1M</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zov<wbr>U9M3VPbk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7c8<wbr>L63uUFcI</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xpN<wbr>Xwp39ee4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=h8K<wbr>tXsKBTKY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=WWB<wbr>01IuMvzA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>True but was she really like that all through middle school? It's been a while since I've rewatched everything but I bet there was at least some point in time where should could have been in normal relationships.</br>  A lot of shit clicked with Dancing Animu.<br>Hirano and Sugita were great leads. Mikuru and Yuki fulfilled the moeblob roles. And the disordered episodes did a good job of controlling the plot.</br>  <br> &gt;Hare Hare Yukai <br> &gt;automatically assume dancing animu </br></br>  Yuki-chan actually made me re-read the novels; now I''m on Volume 6.<br> Kyon has to move a rock so Haruhi can go on a treasure hunting and find absolutely nothing <br> 150 pages of this <br>I don't remember this volume being so boring, though.</br></br></br>  <br><br>There's that little flashback moment where she's in middle school, wearing something green or yellow and shouting that she's not interested in anyone who isn't an alien time traveller etc etc</br></br>  <br>this<br><br>Really though, the variety of what happens is one of the main appeals to me, it's got everything from trying to write a novel to massive space battles.<br>I also like the way that pretty much every character has some major part to play, e.g. Kimidori seems like just a one-episode character at first but has a much larger role later on.<br>No character goes "unused" apart from Nakamaka or whatever the girl in Wandering Shadow was called</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's actually pretty boring the second time around. It was fun when I first read it though.<br>It's also the only volume I own.<br><br>Mikuru was nice in it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't that volume 7?<br>I though 6 had the short stories about the guy who had a crush on Nagato and the one about the culture festival</br></br>  <br>In that case yeah I bet she is. If we were talking 3D then no she'd probably still had done it at some point but anime standards, she's as pure as a girl who runs around in a bunny suit can be.</br>  <br>Yeah, it's actually Volume 7.<br><br>My bad.</br></br></br>  <br>Vol. 1 sold 2.5k, not good at all</br>  Would Haruhi be one to go about nude in the open?<br><br>When no one's looking?</br></br>  <br>Lets all guess a date when Season 3 would be announced.</br>  <br>For aliens? Yes. For no reason except to do it? Doubt it.</br>  <br>Anon-kun, denwa!</br>  <br>it has everything i love</br>  <br>In Asian cultures, it's common for a girl to prize her virginity and for her first to take a direct responsibility for her. Asian girls are often pure until college, though that's gradually changing in the more progressive cultures like South Korea and to a lesser extent, Japan.<br><br>If you're nearby any big university, there's probably a population of Asians, and you can ask around on the pretense that it's for a psychology survey or a magazine article.</br></br></br>  <br> Beautiful, energetic girl you love (who is also a goddess) asks you to join her club <br> There's a guy there she dragged into joining <br> Doesn't do anything, just complains and berates her <br> She wants his dick, tries to recreate the world so she can fuck him <br> You do absolutely everything for her, arrange for her the sort of life she dreams of having <br> You do this with a smile on your face because you'll do anything to keep her happy for just one more day <br> She thanks you for your hard work <br> Know that you have to keep smiling because that's what she wants from you. <br><br>Being Koizumi is suffering.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>This anon gets me. He's like waifufag whose dreams were answered and has been put into the world where his waifu that he's always wanted is but can never have her because MC plot armor.</br>  It's only now, I realize that this girl I met in high school became a hardcore fan of Haruhi over the time I knew her. She already had the energy, the looks, the infamy, the chuunibyou, and the superiority complex, but she went on to get the hair and subtle but undeniable merchandise like the headband a bunch of buttons in her backpack with pic related.<br><br>I'm pretty sure no one ever caught on. The girl just seemed like a weirdo egotist.</br></br>  <br>Harli is a miracle of the universe</br>  <br>Sounds like my kind of girl.</br>  <br>Itsuki kind of exist for haruhi because shes a fujoshi who likes handsome men anf boys love</br>  <br>I just wish society didn't not break her and she still have same personality. If I meet this type of girl, I would definitely marry her.</br>  <br><br>This one time, I saw a guy she didn't like ask her out, and she didn't just say no. She yelled out about how gross he was for asking her that and then pointed at this guy at her table saying she'd rather date him. I don't know if either guy wanted to hit her or kiss her.  Probably both wanted both. <br><br>She's married now, by the way. I'm not sure she loves him the way she hugged up to those lucky few in high school, but it is what it is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We're blogging but the thread is dead anyways, does she still have those Haruhi moments?</br>  <br>Interesting.</br>  <br>This one time, I was nice to her and gave her a little bit of cash for a snack because she forgot her wallet. She went on to hold her hand out to another guy at my table telling him to cough it up and ripped a little bit of his hair out when he wouldn't give her money. Crazy bitch probably made a voodoo doll with it.</br>  <br>Jesus I hope she was hot and smart like Haruhi otherwise I doubt any decent guy would marry that.</br>  <br><br>Ribbonless Haruhi is adorable af</br></br>  <br>Very true. While I do love the ribbon seeing her without it is refreshing.</br>  <br>The only good part of Yuki-chan, sadly. But it was a damn good part, I have to admit.</br>  <br>Sure it was an alternate timeline, but pretty much confirmed.</br>  <br><br>Nice way to sum it up.</br></br>   For this way m'lady   <br>don't</br>  Bump  Just finished the first ln, got another 3 to go to finally know what happens after the movie.    <br>Hell yeah.</br>  <br>Just skip to vol 6, KyoAni already covered the first 5 volumes</br>  <br><br>Oh my.<br><br>Is that why there's no season 3? Because of a lack of new material?</br></br></br></br>  <br>There are 11 volumes.</br>  <br>To give hope to those who need a reason to live.</br>  <br>Wow, 11? Did it end there?</br>  <br>From the looks of it, yes.</br>  What if Itsuki was really Yuki on computer  Would you read Haruhi if it was a Shoujo manga?  <br>Nope. 9, 10, and 11 were essentially one story, but posed more cliffhangers than they resolved. Tanigawa clearly has no plan and was just throwing foreshadowing at the wall so he could have some of it stick later. I guess it's easier than actually trying to wrap the series up.</br>  <br>I would.</br>  <br>Depends. Whose the main character?</br>  <br>My dick.</br>    <br>He mentioned in the official fanbook he was working on vol. 12 and it was implied he actually wrote a substantial amount since he was saying how he was going to talk to his editor soon about certain plot points, and then in the interview published in that fanbook it censored all those details out. It might've been a gimmick but I think there's some truth to it also.</br>    <br><br>A real shame we might never get to see the rest of Haruhi's class.

Is berserk Hibiki supposed to be this erotic? As soon as her face goes dark and she starts grunting I just kind of lose track of everything.  <br>the music comes from their gears idiot</br>  Carol can fly right  <br>Pretty sure the whole bullying thing overrides anything else.</br>  <br>Her hat's probably just filled with helium, that's why it's so big.</br>  <br><br>Miku's holding the camera you dorks.</br></br>  <br><br>Enjoy your new fetish.</br></br>  <br>All 2hus can fly.</br>  <br><br>You tried.</br></br>  <br>Villains aren't supposed to be this cute.</br>    <br>Is this a reference to something or are they just being delinquents?</br>    <br><br>Dominant sexy evil and incompetent crazy maniac had already been done.</br></br>  <br>I would become mates with Anime-chan, but I want to marry Mantis-chan.</br>   Girls basically whoring themselves in a promo picture <br>Why is this allowed?<br>Have we become so brain-dead that anime producers have to bait their audience with cleavage and sexually suggestive pictures in order for them to watch it?</br></br>  <br>Yes. It's happening with every show now.</br>  <br>That one was the worst. I came for the trains but left due to all the unnecessary boobs that they were trying to shove down my throat</br>  <br>Why not both?</br>  <br><br><br>The quality of promo pictures has really become worse while the fanservice has been increased a lot, pic related.<br>It's best to not consider them "official" art anymore but more like fanart done for magazines.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, she still has a shapely body even if she is acting like a raging animal.</br>  <br>Those cabooses really heated my boiler tubes, if you know what I mean.</br>  <br><br>The appeal is that of watching a storm.<br><br>You know at any moment, she'll turn to you and make your entrails extrails... but in those carnivorous fangs, that fell energy, the pose of a predator, You secretly long to feel her pour that wild emotion into you. It would almost be worth exsanguination.<br><br>But enough about that. Bikki is sunshine and happy thoughts right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's one of those don't watch the show, fap to the fanservice shows for me.</br>  <br>Megami and NyanType's editors always make such requests to anime studio. It's not like anime staff prefer to draw lewd promo pic, but it depends on magazine's editor's decision. If you want some cool promo pics, Newtype magazine is a better choice.</br>  <br>I wouldn't need any encouragement to climb her mountains.</br>  <br>Megami and NyanType magazines' are for moe otakus. <br>Newtype is a general anime magazine.</br></br>  <br><br>I posted it to show a case of bad official art though, boobs don't work like that, anatomy doesn't work like that.<br>But maybe it needs a more blatant example.</br></br></br>  <br>It isn't. That's after the scene where they tell that Elf9 doesn't have a vagina, so it's more a vagina joke than a penis one</br>  <br><br>Commie butchered it. To forde the "down there" they changed their math topic from luck and probability to fractions. However it makes no sense to say "it doesn't matter if there's nothing down there" because for fractions it fucking does matter. The actual thing Miku was saying according to CR was that it doesn't matter if luck is there or not regarding probabilities, but there's no way to put a "down" in there.</br></br>  <br><br>I hate to defend Commie, but I've yet to have seen an translation I liked on that line.<br><br>I remember a similar one way back with E7:AO where no one had a clue how to get the wording and intent across at the same time. Sometimes translation just doesn't work.</br></br></br></br>  <br>By this point using Commie subs is traditional with Symphogear, it wouldn't feel right otherwise.<br><br>And it's not as if the other sub groups are really any better.</br></br></br>  <br><br>If there was a clear "winner", I'd be using someone else. The problem is that Commie is consistent. They'll fuck with the script, but we all can tell when they're doing it.</br></br>  <br>So Miku and the others were talking about math and Hibiki took what she said the wrong way since she had Elf9 on her mind?

I still hope for a S2.<br><br>Pic related for actual S2 never.</br></br></br>  <br>Is there even enough source material for one?</br>  <br>tfw no more magic hour</br>  Honest question for people who disliked Locodol: are you fans of the idol genre?    Can't post a picture because I'm at work, but I really worry Zvezda won't get a season 2.   Never ever   Relax guys. Do you guys remember Moyashimon? First season: 2007, second season: 2012. There is always hope.  <br> Bartender on there <br> No Noucome <br>Why? Bartender ended fine.</br></br></br>  <br>It'd be a stretch right now. Depends on how much they add/change, since the manga has interactions with Class Cute instead of Awa^2 Girls, with the last couple eps being anime original. The anime covered a bit more than 2 volumes of the manga, and the 4th volume came out last week. Might need another few chapters first.</br>  This one is even worse because it's a "LN translations never" too .    <br><br>Silly show but I enjoyed watching it with /a/</br></br>  <br> Mononoke <br> Baccano <br>I can at least take solace from the knowledge of your good taste anon.</br></br></br>    <br>I'm almost completely sure they'll duck season 2 up because they will confuse what went right and shift the focus to either melodrama or action</br>  <br>I really, really want more Locodol. It was the perfect blend of cozy and sexy.</br>  Probably Shimoneta. Supposedly it's not doing so well in Nipland, which is basically all that matters anyway    <br>This show was a real breath of fresh air. I wish there were more comedies like it.</br>  Glasslip S2 never ;_;  <br>Ended so abruptly and unconcluded even with the ova, pissed me off</br>  <br>WHY?</br>  <br>Tell me about it.  Who were you rooting for? </br>  <br>Right girl's design is goddess tier. Picked up.</br>    I hate Yamakan but he's a competent director when adapting stuff.  I've lost all hope.

I mean, the throwing you into it part is cool, but a little bit more world building would be very helpful (since the anime is having an original ending).</br>   no samurai champloo <br><br>fuck man don't you want to see them be ronin and travel together in japan</br></br>  Why is it so easy for western cartoons to get second seasons compared to anime?  <br><br>All I can remember was how gay Yukari was for Nanyako.<br><br>Also there were athletic short stack sweaty tits.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, just that it's fundamentally stupid and appeals to the lowest common denominator. There's a lot of really smart and well-written SOL series and acting like Nichijou is some kind of masterpiece belies a certain ignorance.</br>  <br>It's cheap to make</br>  ;_;  <br>Western cartoons are mostly low budget shit and are typically made for either little kids who don't care what they're watching as long as it has flashy colors and fart jokes, or stoners who just want to watch surreal weird shit.</br>  <br>Are you a literal retard?<br>Western cartoons aren't trying to boost sales for source materials. <br>Plus, most of the stuff nowadays is made in Flash and takes a day to shit out.</br></br></br>  It's just one of those shows that wasn't popular enough ;-;  <br> Western cartoons aren't trying to boost sales for source materials. <br>As opposed to anime, most of which is just glorified commercials for manga and LNs?</br></br>  NouCome  <br>Exactly. You pretty much watch 4-8 hours of a commercial just to have it end on a cliff hanger for you to buy the manga/LN.<br><br>When western shows do that it usually means they have a season 2 prepared.</br></br></br>  darker than black  <br>Japanese put more effort into anime and cover various demographics whereas Western cartoons are mostly flash shit for children or tryhard "mature" comedies for adolescents<br>Even Disney is moving to 3D CGI shit now</br></br>  <br>Thank God.

Not sure why when the intent is so obvious.</br>  <br><br>it looks fine in your picture.</br></br>      <br>HOLY SHIT THERE'S AN OVA FOR JINRUI HAPPENING?</br>  <br>No. That part was about Locodol.</br>    <br>I'd settle for full translation of the latest book.</br>    <br>It's for the best. First season was inconsistent as fuck.</br>  <br>It kinda isn't.<br>Most of the western stuff you see has already gotten its seal of approval after passing the Pilot stage.<br>Pretty much for every show that is on, there's another show or two that didn't get more than one or two episodes, let alone an entire season.<br><br>But that's kinda besides the point, the reason is mostly because they aren't advertisements, and when they are advertisements, it's not for something that's going to die quickly. Also western cartoons run the risk of just getting straight up cancelled abruptly in the middle of a run, while with anime you can probably count the amount of times that's happened on one hand.</br></br></br></br></br>   fuck this gay earth   I know A1 rushed it but I still want more  What about a season 3 never?<br>This show was so good that made me buy a karuta deck.</br>  <br>But anon-kun Noragami is getting S2.<br> Also, Usagi Drop?

So I'll go with this.  <br>But Johnny Bravo already had 4 seasons.</br>  <br>i know you're just ribbing me, meant to post a different picture from my P&amp;S folder.<br><br>But yeah panty and stocking</br></br></br>  <br> i know you're just ribbing me <br>For you pleasure, of course.</br></br>    <br>Where are her nipples?</br>  <br>Missed dearly. As a avid fan of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms games on PS2, it felt very self insert for me</br>  <br>this, someone should edit them in</br>  <br> They even went so far as to make a School days reference in the OVA. <br>Wasn't there one pretty early on in the show, too? During the twirling desks scene?</br></br>  I dont care how few of you remember/watched this. They ended it on an obvious cliffhanger. Its been over FIVE years. <br><br>WHERE IS MY HEROMAN S2!?!?</br></br>  <br>Is there anything worth adapting to warrant a second season? Probably not, right? Too bad.</br>  <br>Yes please.</br>  Does Tokyo Ravens had any chance of second season?  <br>As far as I know there isn't enough source material from the manga to make a season 2 yet.</br>  <br>Why would it?<br>It wrapped up in the end, and overall the quality of the show was extremely mediocre.</br></br>  <br>Jesus christ are we 6 volumes behind</br>    <br>Not entirely disliking locodol but yes I am a fan of pic related.</br>  <br>But I like it.</br>  <br>Too bad</br>      <br>I was never able to enjoy that show as much as I would have liked, because of all the horrible threads.<br>It was some kind of horrible combination of /mu/, underage kids, and the regular KyoAni shitposters.</br></br>  <br>Reminder that Saki did nothing wrong and Shoko should be hanged from the neck until dead.</br>  tsukihime  <br>Hibikek and it's threads were much much worse</br>  Why are the gods so cruel?  <br><br><br>I'd kill lots of innocents to make it happen<br><br>Also no more Chaika in any form greatly displeases me<br><br>not many anime give off a feeling of adventure like that for me</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  JoJo thread.

Does it sell well in Japan to warrant a continuation since I've seen people wanting Part IV.  <br>Probably, wait until december, now get out before you get spoiled.  Bruce Willis was a ghost the whole time </br>  Is Kars ever coming back ?  <br>Thanks anon.</br>  <br>Well gee I don't know that manga has been running for 25+ years, sometimes tells me that I might be.</br>  <br>read the manga<br>The first three parts really aren't that amazing and imo none of the parts can really stand up to 7 or 8 which would take many years to get animated</br></br>  The cleric of homosexuality has arrived  I wonder if Johny would've used the stone mask for his own benefit if it existed in his universe. I mean, he was a selfish person, and most of his actions were for his own benefit.  Just finished part 6. What the fuck.  Just finished Italian Jojo, this nigga gonna die forever? savage shit right there god damn    Post pictures of Joubin  Post some of your favorite panels, I really like this one.  <br>No, just because Gau {roest has been stopped for now, doesn't mean it's bus time</br>  Dick is alright, but have you tried putting a refreshing 7-up in your mouth?  <br>I got a lot of them, I only have them saved as the pages though</br>  <br>the fuck? how'd I manage to spell Gay Priest that badly</br>    Spoilered for part 8 twist    <br>Yep.<br><br>Yep.</br></br></br>  never ever  <br>This my favorite.</br>  <br>dubs speak the truth<br>hopefully Gappy will stay awesome</br></br>  <br>I'm confused, people said that the binder full of women was the stand user that Kira made eat their own fingers, but now I remember that it's this panel that made me think it was Kira's binder.<br><br>Which is it?</br></br></br>  <br>The stand user tells Josuke it was him</br>  <br><br>I made it larger for shits and giggles.</br></br>  <br>Big Johnny is still the best</br>  <br><br>No I just legit want more pictures of Joubin</br></br>  <br>He stopped rationalizing. I think that even if he managed to land into a planet/star, he wouldn't notice it</br>  <br>Thank you anon</br>  <br> stand </br>  Are the corpse parts of the SBRverse the equivalent of the stone mask for the original universe?  <br>him as in the stand user, not josuke?</br>  <br>Really really really want to know? <br><br>well... <br><br> Morioh Town has a Stand </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=L6S<wbr>2Tj-3nmw</wbr>  [ ]<br> CHEW </br></br></br>    <br> Part 4 never <br>Part 4 will happen, part 7 won't</br></br>    <br> John Joestar 16:33 </br>  <br>With how fucking weird the series is now, I wouldn't be surprised.<br> NEW STAND, MAGIC MAN: BRINGS BACK OLD ENEMIES FROM THE JOJO SERIES <br>would work, similar to Bohemian Rhapsody</br></br></br>  <br>What chapter is this from?</br>  I kind of don't want part 4 to happen because animeonly fags  <br>when he's in the apartment with the naked chick.</br>  <br>That's actually a pretty cool idea, but would make for a shitty final villain i feel</br>  With the direction part 8 is going, you think we'll see Gappy's four testicles? Or will that be a no-no for the publication  yfw you have no bros to journey toward Cairo on land with.<br><br> It causes me grief beyond words </br></br>  <br>When he put that dude through a glass table?</br>  <br>The World confirmed to be Johnathan's stand</br>  <br>They're more of the Stand Arrow equivalent because the parts bestow Stands on the people who get them.<br><br>The only other way to get a Stand is to be born with it or basically achieve the Golden Rectangle Spin.</br></br></br>  I still have no idea what Pucci's Heaven is. So it's a world where... people can see the future, but he can't?  <br>It's a world with no surprises.<br><br>A world where everyone is subconsciously aware of everything ahead of them. Also a world where only he has full control over what "Destiny" is.</br></br></br>  <br>Everyone in the world will know what happens to them, and must face it. However, the holder of『Made in Heaven』has the power to change fate.</br>  <br>Fate is an actual thing in Jojo, Pucci's heaven would just make people aware of their fates but they're unable to change it. Basically everyone is Zeppeli in PB.</br>  <br>Only without the great hat.</br>  H OT P A N T S  <br>Are you dense?<br><br> it's still Kira, Kira hid in Josuke to mask his identity, but he'll come back later </br></br></br>  <br>Kira's dead dude</br>    So since the dub is giving the English characters their proper accents, does that mean when Stardust Crusaders is dubbed, Jotaro will have a proper Japanese accent?    <br>Too lazy to crop a panel.</br>  <br>Nah mane<br>Canonically he's speaking japanese<br>The only reason the other jojos have accents is because they're canonically speaking british english<br>It's pretty obvious</br></br></br></br>    <br>So what you're saying is that, to get the truest experience, I need to watch the dub for the first two parts, then the original Japanese for Stardust Crusaders? Makes sense.</br>  What page or scene brought you into JoJo?<br><br>I thought from a page with Ringo that he was a big bad when someone posted SBR in a OPT</br></br>  <br>clearly</br>  found these on infinite  <br>No. Everyone is in permanent Thoth mode unless Pucci gets involved.</br>  <br>the first thing I remember was the OVA Jotaro vs Dio fight when I wanted to know where ZA WARUDO came from some time ago<br>but I didn't come into the series until a month ago after I stopped myself from reading the wiki</br></br>    <br>Post any cosplays of characters from Parts 1 to 4.</br>  <br>I was brought into JoJo by my friend saying "It's a good series, fits your tastes" thats it</br>  <br> I thought from a page with Ringo that he was a big bad when someone posted SBR in a OPT <br><br>He isn't just a minor villain, he serves a purpose.</br></br></br>  <br>At the beginning of part 7? In a heartbeat. I think Araki tried to create some parallels between him and part 1's Dio.</br>  <br>I honestly don't remember how I found it, but when I did and started   watching   it I realized that it was the   anime   that my roommate had watched before that I never payed attention to/thought was stupid. I think he found it from a Twobest friends playthrough. Chances are I saw it on a reddit post, but I don't really know.</br>  <br>The thread I got these from doesn't have much</br>    <br>the Joseph in that scares me</br>    <br>This stunt was the peak of part 4 for me.</br>      <br> AWAKEN MY MASTERS </br>  <br/>  <br> inb4 Guido Mista </br>      <br>This again.</br>  I want to cum inside Hot pants.    <br>Sure, but he's not the Big Bad of SBR, that's Valentine</br>       leave Wham to me     this fucking thread   <br>What happened to chiza ?</br>  <br>Nigger you lost to a pigeon</br>  <br>Why can't lardpeople understand who they can and can't cosplay well</br>    <br>Gettin real tired of this Jolyne</br>  <br> homestuck  <br>get the fuck out</br></br>   best thing in part 5   <br>I want to cum inside Pucci!</br>  <br>What flat looking fanart.</br>  <br>Stop that! Pucci is Pure!</br>  So the Rock guys in jojolion are the new pillar men  <br>Pretty much. Just not as cool and fabulous though.</br>    <br>Why anon ?</br>  <br>Terrible. Even the Jolyne sucks. They should just stick to part 5 characters.</br>  <br> tfw araki is a serious writer now and won't do anything like the Pillar Men again </br>  <br> Who is part 8's villain? </br>  <br>I feel like he did evolve as a character greatly, while still a bit selfish with his goals, his actions were selfless unless his dark determination kicked in.<br><br>The only time his selfishness kicked in and was really bad was when his wife, one of two people he loved the most was dying, and he didn't care who else got the disease as long as it wasn't her.<br>Then it bounced to his son, causing him to sacrifice himself to save him.</br></br></br></br>  so in the viz release of stardust crusaders, does joseph still say HOLY SHIT?  <br>I really like this one</br>    <br>The meteor exists in sbr also</br>  <br> tfw it could be Funny Valentine again </br>      <br><br>Pillar men= /fit/<br>Rock men= /fa/</br></br></br>    <br> confirmed gay sex <br> pure <br>pick one</br></br></br>  <br>Not this time... <br>I'm on break</br></br>  <br>You're weak. Defiling Gay Priest only shows you have no shame.</br>  Is it wrong that I could only imagine Josuke and Okuyasu's voices in Part 4 as  the English dubs of Yusuke and Kuwabara from YuYu Hakusho ?  <br>Some day I'll destroy you</br>  <br>It's super fitting though</br>  <br>I did the same with okuyasu, but gave josuke the voice of Walter from SMT4</br>  <br>You chose the wrong meme to try to defeat Gay Priest with. <br> He'll only submit to DIO. </br></br>  <br>I like how Black Sabbath seems to pay tribute to The World here.</br>  <br>I can only imagine it as this guy https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=x6W<wbr>EXvwGREo</wbr>  [ ]<br>I always pictured Okuyasu with a pretty goofy ebonic accent, but I see most fan shit give him a rough voice.</br></br>    <br>don't you mean, HermitPurple_arrives.png ?</br>    Let's talk about That Man,  Jobin     <br>Let's talk about Lucy, why did she become a cunt?</br>  <br>What's the stand power?<br><br>I already know it screams REEEEEEEEEEE during its rush attack</br></br></br>  <br>how are norisuke, jobin, and lucy hanging out together?</br>  <br>It has the power of making you shit uncontrollably. it's the perfect power to stop shameful protagonists</br>  <br>Stando power!</br>  <br>How  rare  is it?</br>      <br>Nah man it shoots spaghetti from people's pockets<br><br><br>Cool art and I love the name</br></br></br></br>  <br>nah that's this stand's power</br>  Do any stands use a spear or lance as a weapon?<br>I'm trying to draw something like it</br>    <br> You thought it was Jojo?

But what about the cast that died during it? Do the ultimate versions of themselves contain their souls or are they different but very similar people with their own souls?<br><br>F.F's little arch would hint to me that it isn't them and they're actually dead but I'm hoping it's not the case because it weighs greatly on how much I like the part.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> ultimate <br><br>I mean alternate. Fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The people who were killed by Pucci in MiH are dead. Completely dead. Those people that looked like them are not them but that universe's replacements. They're not reincarnations, they are new people.</br>  <br>This Iggy.</br>       yfw pucci lost   <br>Is that Araki as gay priest?</br>  <br>Atleast he died for the love of his life.</br>  <br><br><br>What the fuck is this, how could anyone think it was a good idea to dress up as Iggy?</br></br></br>  <br> They're not reincarnations, they are new people <br>Irene and the bunch sort of are reincarnations, that's why they're not all weird-looking like the Jolyne and Jotaro from the second universe.</br></br>  Doc have you done work on this pic yet? Like transparent background  <br> Irene and the bunch sort of are reincarnations, <br>No reincarnations would they have the same souls. MiH stops that from crossing over. Irene just happens to not look as shit as Joleen.</br></br>  <br>I'll make it transparent if you want, but is there a bigger version available?</br>  <br><br>Jotaro's only love. It's why it didn't work out with Jolyne's mom.</br></br>  <br>I like the Johnny</br>  tfw reading the manga strains my eyes so have to wait for part 4  <br>Just cropped it from the JoJonium cover, don't think so</br>  <br> reading the manga strains my eyes <br> strains my eyes </br></br>  <br><br><br>I can't find a larger res of the cover (830 × 625 being the biggest), this will have to do for now.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah i have to squint to see the words and black and whtie is offensive to my eyes start toget headaches</br>  <br>Why? do you have dyslexia or something? I'm not trying to be a dick with this, as I know 2 people with dyslexia that cant read black and white well, I think JoJo's coloured Adventure have done most of Part 4, if that helps</br>  <br>Goddamnit, you fucking beat me.</br>  <br> yeah i have to squint to see the words and black and whtie is offensive to my eyes start toget headaches <br>You might be spending too much time on the computer.</br></br>  <br>My friend say "watch this anime its about a strong dude who's really nice and his foster brother becomes an immortal vampire in episode 2"<br><br>I knew about it just like everyone else prior but it wasn't until the 2012 anime that I got into it. Feel like I missed out on a lot, would have loved to follow Love Train with /a/</br></br></br>  <br>yeah probably<br><br>no i dont have dyslexia</br></br></br>  <br>What the hell is wrong with you?</br>  <br>oh, either way, the coloured scans might help</br>  <br>thanks i will chcek them out</br>  <br>this sounds like headcanon, do you have any evidence at all besides what you want to think?</br>  <br>just search JoJo's Coloured Adventure</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128739048 <br>araki finally ends his shitty parts and restarts for something better</br>  <br>Yeah I remember having problems with squinting and my eyes bothering me but I think that was because of reading way fucking too much at once<br><br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128739048 <br>if you think about it's not that bad, the characters did exist at one point, what they did still happened. Just pretend it's like any other series when you're done with it the characters are more or less dead because they haven't done anything else. Write fanfiction about them being in heaven or something if you're that sad. Also Parts 7 and 8 are really good so it makes up for the big fuck you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>So its completely new? And its good?</br></br></br>  <br>If you liked 4 then this could beat it.</br>  <br>Part 7 is the best part. Araki really steps up the writing in the new universe. 8 is interesting but unless he pulls out all the stops it's gonna fall flat.</br>  <br>i just found it thank you!</br>  <br>No problem, glad I could help, have fun</br>  <br><br>Adored part 4, also really liked part 5<br><br><br><br>Really? After reading the description it doesnt really sound ''jojo''</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its the best out of all jojo</br>  <br>it's a horserace and it has a Johnny Joestar, and it has stands. It maybe not be Part 2 Muscle men or Part 1 vampires but it's still jojo in my book. i get what you mean though at first it seems weird.</br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128739048 <br><br>The only people who really died were  the main cast of Part 6 and Jotaro . Everybody else made it through the reset just fine, including all characters from other parts who were still alive apart from MAYBE  Giorno. <br><br>At the same time it's not clear whether  the main casts souls were re-incarnated or if they are different people. Either way they all died to finally end the Joestar curse and their alternative selves, regardless of being them or not have far better lives. Irene/Jolyne has a good relationship with her father and isn't in jail, Hermes sister is still alive, weatherman is still alive and Anasui didn't murder anybody. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Annasui didn't murder anybody <br><br>but he's still a huge wanker with pink hair, right? right?</br></br></br>  <br>is there even any good jojo fanfiction to get confused about?</br>  <br> Jotaro's ravioli <br><br>on second thought, I'm not confused why someone made it, but I still feel kind of confused.</br></br></br>   POST VIDEOS THAT PERFECTLY EXPLAIN STANDS <br><br>Echos Act 1:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=d8u<wbr>4CEBVq7s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>At first I had no idea how the fuck this had anything to do with Echoes but I had forgotten the ending<br> Is Tim Eric's stand or Eric Tim's stand? </br></br>    <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rL3<wbr>lqUREAQw</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Bohemian Rhapsody</br></br></br>  <br>how did he kill the raptors without being seen? was he killing them in an entirely different universe, or can he be semi-invisible if you don't look at him from a certain angle</br>  <br><br>Bast: <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PRW<wbr>n6sciVn4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  Is it wrong if i think Part 8 is the best one so far? Love the characters (Gappy might be my favorite JoJo, and Yasuho is top-tier waifu material), the story is super interesting, the battles are fun and this is the first part where the art doesn't get confusing as hell when too much stuff is going on.<br><br>I can see why people who have followed it monthly complain about it feeling like it's going nowhere, but i read it in a day and the pacing felt perfect.</br></br>  <br>It's perfectly fine to do so, that's what I think, each fight actually adds more plot instead of making it monster of the week.</br>  <br>Valentine is just too good</br>  <br>wasn't expecting that edit, kek<br><br><br> implying it's not the sweat from his rolls or is it   SUTANDO POWAH <br>top kek</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fatty's voice was fucking hilarious, sounded a little bit like  that lil ol me faggot from gravity falls <br><br>Most of the voices were great except I hate young Dio and i thought hol horse could've been a little bit deep to sound less like a hillbilly and more like a cowboy, but whatever.</br></br></br>  <br>I doubt so.

He doesn't have any weird quirks to his sociopathy aside from Doppio but every action he does just reeks of some sort of complexity addiction that he just comes off as a hard to like villain for the wrong reasons. He seems moronic outside of combat but he's not supposed to be.</br>  I finished SBR yesterday. I thought it was good and all but wasn't really so blown away and immediately gushing over it. Why is it so popular?<br>Though I guess 4 took me a while to like, even after I finished it.<br>Right now I would probably rank:<br>2&gt;6&gt;4=7=3&gt;1&gt;5</br></br></br>  <br>One of his dumbest decisions was the whole mission surrounding his daughter. NO ONE would have been after her or cared if he just never did that. He wouldn't have been paranoid about people finding out his identity through her if he never did that, because no one had the slightest idea she was his daughter.<br><br>Even IF people knew his identity, so? His stand was OP enough for it to not matter. If anyone attacked him he'd just show up out of nowhere and chest them.</br></br></br>  <br>Another dumb decision is the the death of Sorbet and Gelato. Why would you piss off your gang's top assassins to the point where they'll go after you when the goal is to not have anyone find out about your identity? If Diavolo just killed the gay shits quietly and never gave Bruno the mission about his daughter, Risotto and his gang would just shut up. And even if he wanted to kill his daughter personally, he didn't have to kill Bruno. If Diavolo just left him alone, he wouldn't be going through an infinite death loop.<br><br>Also, why would he want to become supreme emperor of the world if his goddamn point is to hide in the shadows as a big brother type person?</br></br></br>  <br>He only tried killing Bruno after Bruno tried to save Trish<br><br>And because he was a fucking idiot</br></br></br>  <br>Here you go Anon.</br>  <br>Nah he just crashed in the Arizona Desert after HEAVEN.</br>  <br> Thanks for bringing me my daughter. Now toodaloo so I can kill her even though that'll piss you off. <br>Diavolo is the worst written main villain Araki has ever made. Nothing makes sense about him.</br></br>  <br>Crashed you say?</br>  <br>I tried drawing the top left panel of </br>  <br>that's bretty gud anon</br>  I am watching the anime and I made it to part 3, why is it so shit<br><br>It's just not funny or entertaining, just a mediocre shonen that introduces its characters like its trying to sell toys. At least it's better animated I guess</br></br>  <br>You drew it sideways idiot.<br><br> Good job actually. </br></br></br>  <br> better animated  <br>It's not</br></br>  <br> Part 3 <br> Shit <br>Anon, you're tastes are the only shit thing here</br></br></br>  <br>He could've just waited until Bruno left. This guy should learn from Kira about staying hidden.</br>  <br>Part 3 is shit. It's one of the worst parts and Jotaro is also the worst JoJo.</br>  <br><br>Thanks, and I'm not sure why it uploaded sideways, it's vertical in the folder</br></br>  Where do I read JJL? I'm on Batoto where I read every other part, but already in the first pages they're calling it "Moriou"<br> or am i retarded and that's right for some reason </br>  <br><br>Part 2 had an excessive amount of slide show bullshit where they would just redraw the panels from the manga and hardly actually animate them. In part 3, the fights have a lot more motion. I only got 5 episodes in though so maybe the quality drops off? <br><br><br><br>It went from being deadpan humor to just, literally a regular ass fight show with just weirder than normal powers</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is Jojo we're talking about. You need to make a stand that generates thousands of beetles or turns things into cacti or alters the planck length or something. Not "it shoots lightning". Come on.</br>  <br>SEX PISTOLS!</br>  <br><br>Yeah really. Although Magician's Red exists, so I dunno<br><br>But, there's a much better bee themed stand, 「NOT THE BEES」</br></br></br></br>  <br> literally a regular ass fight show with just weirder than normal powers <br>Those weirder than normal powers have been powering the series for more than 20 years.<br> Though the Stands in Part 3 are kind of stale. </br></br></br>  <br>That reminds me, we got 4444 post in the past thread as well.<br><br>Is BtD going on right now?</br></br></br>  <br> Not "it shoots lightning". Come on. <br>The Stardust Crusaders Stands was literally<br> Punches well <br> Use rapier <br> Shoot projectile <br> Use fire <br>And so on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> will zeppeli has italian accent <br> caesar doesn't <br><br>???</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it's called bad luck.</br>  <br>I think weather report already has lightning manipulation. Good try, though.<br><br>Neat drawing.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't mind that the stands are weird, although the concept that suddenly a whole bunch of people have imaginary friends which allow them to kill pretty much anyone else instantly with no evidence kind of limits the options of the plot. <br><br>What I mind is that it's about a few assholes who all look the fucking same going on a roadtrip to kill a character who's arc already wrapped up, fighting monsters of the week along the way, without even a hint of sarcasm</br></br></br></br>  <br> Aida Mitsuoh </br>  is dio still alive<br><br>will we ever get to see him again<br><br>  i miss him ;_;  </br></br></br></br>  <br>They're not really imaginary friends when only a very few of them are sentient and can talk to their users. Hell, do you consider Cream Starter, Thoth, or Beach Boy to be an imaginary friend?</br>  <br>Part 3's not that bad, its not the best part, but its hardly shit<br>  I like Jotaro more then Jolyne, Giorno and Josuke  </br></br>  <br>No, this new universe's Dio died a long time ago.</br>  <br>That's right. Moriou = Morioh = もりおう or whatever the Kanji are.</br>  <br>The poet?</br>  <br>whoa how did I forget this happened</br>  Does /jojo/ still have drawfags? Where did Giorno go?    <br>Went back to school.</br>  <br>Alright. I've just always seen it as Morioh so I wasn't sure, thanks<br>Also "Joshuu" vs the wiki's "Joshu"</br></br>  <br>Stardust stands were new so they were still pretty basic. And even then there were some gimmicky shit.</br>   beginning of episode 16 of Part III <br> "Shortly after capturing Enyaba, Jojo's group acquired a carriage." <br>Nigga what? Where and how did they manage to get this carriage? Why is this allowed?</br></br>  <br> Just got past the chapter in part 8 where Yos   I can never remember her full name  and Josuke get hypnotised<br><br>This is the first chapter in JoJo i ever just skipped, god it was fucking painful.</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly it was this<br><br>along with the promise of CUHRAZZY fights and cheesy one liners/dialogue in general</br></br></br>  <br><br>right, I'll think of something more along the lines of part 4-8 stands when it comes to abilities. i just assumed RHCP was new enough to copy</br></br>  <br> Yasuho and Josuke get hypnotised <br><br>Did this actually happen? I feel like this is either bullshit or I may have forgotten as well.</br></br></br>  <br>What is the "Plot Contrivance" Foundation?</br>  <br>is it really that bad to you?<br>or is other stuff going on in your life and the chapter just wasn't helping?<br>not trying to be condescending, just actually asking.</br></br></br>  <br>Tsurugi's stand, or the kid dressed as a girl</br>  <br>I thought that only did Illusion with people's face s and interact with paper-like objects, when did she "hypnotise" one of them?</br>  <br>I have asspergers<br>Not that you could tell, after 6 years i learned how to avoid showing signs of spergdom and hold a decent conversation, but i just don't enjoy comedy scenes that play off of social embarrassment, it just feels cringeworthy to me</br></br>  <br>I think anon's talking about Paper Moon King's powers.</br>  <br> she <br>its a boy dressed as a girl to ward off demons or some shit. Also i guess if you want to be technical than yea its an illusion rather than hypnosis</br></br>  <br> hypnotised </br>  <br>i see<br>i guess i can understand that it's not everyone's cup of tea</br></br>  <br>my apologies.</br>  In order to discover "heaven", Dio learned first the concept of Fate, Future and Gravity.<br><br>What did he learn?</br></br>  <br>Will Eyes of Heaven get an english release?<br> Will it get a PC release? </br></br>  <br>I can only pray</br>  <br>All johnny does is whine and get shot. Fuck that guy.</br>  <br>Now in color, thanks to some anon</br>  <br>It's odd how rarely I get to post this</br>    The dancing Kakyoin of majesty has arrived  manga that should have an anime adaption- argue in one page.          <br>South Park<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=C90<wbr>uhvXW1KM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>          <br>I've seen this image posted before and I find it intriguing. <br><br>Source?</br></br></br>   On one hand, his life his hell, but on the other, it's entertaining as fuck. <br><br> Also, Kyouka a best. </br></br>  <br>Teppu, I believe.
