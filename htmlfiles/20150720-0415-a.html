They sure did the MLs justice in the movie amirite? <br><br>I look forward to the 765 purists being buttmad about the ML anime when Haruka and the original gang appear for all but 30 seconds.</br></br></br></br></br>  Unrelated to CG but I just want to say.<br><br>I love Makoto.</br></br>  So TakeP appeared on the second day of the 10th live.  <br> Side-M anime when <br><br>So WHEN is it?</br></br></br>  <br>I love saturated tumblr gifs</br>  <br><br>She is so perfect.</br></br>  <br>http://yaraon.blog109.fc2.com/<br><br>I'm looking but I'm not seeing.</br></br></br>  <br> I look forward to the 765 purists being buttmad about the ML anime when Haruka and the original gang appear for all but 30 seconds. <br>That's going to be funny.<br><br>But I have a feeling A-1 will get third time lucky.

The anime adapts a setting of the CG-verse that can do justice to details in the mobage and keeps things fresh. The anime differentiated CG to the point that it's no longer a clone of 765 except with different idols through a more corporate setting.<br><br>You're just bitter than your favorite CG isn't in it / isn't getting enough spotlight.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You're just bitter than your favorite CG isn't in it / isn't getting enough spotlight. <br>Fuck, you got me.</br></br>  Now that Million Live anime is confirmed can we agree that CG was shit?  <br>CG and 2011 were shit. The only good iDOLM@STER anime is Puchimas.</br>  <br><br>Nope. CG and ML is shit. Puchimasu too. <br><br>Only good im@s is vanilla 765. Also, Side-M.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Love Live is better, you faggots</br></br></br>  <br>I like the CG anime, but mostly due to the backstage scenes<br><br>The second half is still just starting</br></br></br>  ML isn't even close to airing and the shitposting has already begun.<br>Can we just talk about cakes instead?</br>  <br> 2011 anime <br> not shit <br>Fuck of, quinternary.</br></br></br>   It's a penis. A penis!   <br>she then rams it up Miria's bum</br>   ML anime announced <br><br>wow~</br></br>  <br> can we agree that CG was shit? <br> was </br></br>  <br>Your shitty cake meme was never funny.<br> Now CG is obsolete just like its idols.</br></br>  <br>Source?

Literally half of the tweets with the 10th Live hashtag is about the ML anime.</br></br></br></br></br>  If you had to pick 7 ML idols for the ML anime to focus on who'd you pick? <br><br>My picks</br></br>  ML is literally the Love Live of idolm@ster  <br>Stop shitposting, Jal</br>  <br>Haruka, Chihaya, Miki, Iori, Yayoi, Yukiho, Makoto.</br>  <br> Megumi <br> Shiho <br> Kotoha <br> Konomi <br>Mah nigga</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't wait for the new /@/ threads here without all the CG cake retards.</br>  I better not be the only one who thinks CG character designs are 10x better than Original/ML.

Somebody just summarize things for me tommorow.</br></br>  <br>What does this even mean.</br>  million live anime confirmed!!<br>they showed the PV in the second live!!</br>  <br>ML designs &gt; CG designs.<br><br><br>Million Love will kill Love Live.

In all honesty, most likely. But is a ML anime confirmed? No, not yet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I can't wait to see her genkiness.  Man, I really liked CG.  <br>Too bad for you, it's going to die now that ML's getting an anime.</br>  <br>I really liked CG threads.<br><br>I hope this shitposting isn't permanent.</br></br></br>  <br>I love CG too</br>  <br> it's going to die <br>More like the ML anime is an attempt to keep ML alive.<br>Million Live wishes it had the userbase that Mobamas does. Or that it generated nearly as much revenue.</br></br></br>  True Blue  <br>Why do so many people hate CG but love the 2011 Anime? They're both good but CG is clearly better.</br>  With ML anime is /@/ finally making a comeback?<br>I missed you guys.</br>  <br>/@/ goes in </br>  <br>2011 anime is a lot of people's introduction to iDOLM@STER. Just like how I have a soft spot for Ace Combat 6 DLC and the Live For You OVA, they'll have a soft spot for the 2011 anime.<br><br>Both have terrible animation outside of the concerts and a few select scenes every other episode. They're okay shows, though.</br></br></br>  <br>See<br><br><br>It's just an animated PV. The actual anime announcement will probably come next year. <br><br><br>Vocal asspained people on 4chan doesn't exactly equate to "so many people". Both series had it's share of fans and haters.

How would you rank My Hero Academia in terms of quality compared to other popular shounen manga? Is it Fairy Tail/Black Clover level of terrible?  <br>Naruto for hipsters</br>  <br>if I wanted western capeshit I'd watch western capeshit or watch the incredibles</br>  <br><br>/thread</br></br>  <br>Nah. Black Clover seems more like a new Naruto, especially character-wise.</br>  <br>Solid 9/10 so far</br>  Bad overall with some really great standout moments.  <br>It's good but it's not my favorite. Also, Fairy Tail is shit.</br>  Naruto with heroes. Really I'm just sticking to it for more frog.  <br> Also, Fairy Tail is shit. <br>That it is.</br></br>  It's breddy good.  <br>Best currently running Shounen. Sympathetic, likable characters. Strategic battles. Fast pacing without 10 chapters spent on a single battle. In battle shounen standards, this is god-tier.</br>  <br>Something like FMA would be considered God Tier, this is just alright.</br>  <br>Best artwork in shonen jump so far</br>  As far as WSJ goes, this is the best thing they've published in years.  <br><br> that rushed ending <br><br> god tier <br><br>yeah no. while fma was good it was far from being perfect</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We need a battle shonen hero for shonen jump.<br><br>World Trigger is not good and Toriko is boring. Bleach is dead. One piece is one piece. And Black Clover is garbage.</br></br></br>  Maybe we can compare with Nanatsu no Taizai.  <br>It's fine. Pretty unoriginal but it's well exectued and the characters are likeable.</br>  So, what's the new generation for battle shonen manga? <br><br>Top 3<br>Boku no hero academia <br>Nanatsu no Taizai <br>Magi</br></br></br></br></br>  I'm now downloading it.  <br>I would say it's below FMA level, which makes it pretty good. At the bottom is Fairy Tail and Bleach (didn't read Black Clover - probably shit).</br>  <br>Dropped it around the tourney.<br>It's boring as shit and I don't like the artstyle at all.</br></br>  The females characters are fucking awesome compared to most battle shonens  <br>Bleach's artwork is better.</br>  <br>It's generic as fuck and I hate superhero shit.</br>  <br>It's the best battle shounen WSJ has had since Nurarihyon and you can tell the author's at least trying to mix things up so that the story doesn't stay too stale. It hasn't really had any memorable fights yet but the current arc has been pretty interesting.</br>  I breath of fresh air for <br>wsj</br>  Best thing since One Piece, love it.  4chan is just full of hipsters, so this isn't the best place to ask. Hero Academia is praised pretty much everywhere else on the internet as very original with a full cast of likable characters and great pacing. The only thing bad about it is its Reddit-tier fanbase.  <br> very original <br>That's bullshit and you know it. BnHA is pretty generic storywise, but compensates it with good execution. Some anons described it as cliche done right.</br></br>  <br>Yukata Tsuyu is BEST TSUYU</br>  <br>read<br><br>See what I mean?

Although Nanatsu has gone to shit since the Ten Commandments showed up.</br>  Even if my hero academia doesn't have the best story or writing ever the execution is absolutely magnificent  <br>Nanatsu no Taizai is disgusting.</br>  <br>Hi cancer.</br>  <br>So you're saying you like MHA better than NnT but not as much as FMA or HxH?</br>  <br>I think he's saying BnHA is better than NnT and as good as FMA/HxH.</br>  <br>Except it's still clearly an 11 version of western capeshit, what with the academia etc...<br>I think it's interesting, the characters are well written and aren't devoid of personality, a quirk doesn't replace one's personality(Not in the sense of the manga but in the sense of mistaking "That guy eats chocolate 24/7" as a valid trait of character).<br>I love the art.<br>MC is good and doesn't have plot armor (He lost in the quarter finale)<br>There's a resident edgelord who is actually pretty chill considering his circumstances (which are actually realistic in the manga's setting)<br>I have high hopes for this. Let's just hope he won't try to make Hands kun a sad backstory or shit like this.<br><br> That's bullshit and you know it. BnHA is pretty generic storywise, but compensates it with good execution. Some anons described it as cliche done right. <br>This, and with some subversion (The idealistic, nice girl doing it for the money and actually being more than capable in battle)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The big problem with Nanatsu is that the backstories, flashbacks, side stories etc... are all really good, and the main story is just terrible.<br>(I also cannot stand the fucking pig, its personality and the way it's drawn triggers my autism to its utmost extremes)</br></br>  Is Bleach the Shonen with the best character designs?

They already had this talk about keeping secrets and shit.  <br> the music is just unbearable for me <br>So you are one of those homosexuals then?</br></br>  3 eps in and it's already so much better than G was. FIS trio became great instead of just ok, dolls are fun, Carol has some weird problems but she's cute and it will be really hard to do something worse than mid-late G where villains were fighting each other for some dumb reasons. I'm lovin' it.    <br>Then don't watch it. /a/ isn't your blog.</br>  <br>Sick nightcore remix bro.</br>  <br>Well, there was only one human villain this time. The others were literally carol's doll so there won't be any dumb fights between them.</br>  <br> hibiki use dainsleif to fight and beat all doll + caroll, but she got controlled by dainsleif at the end so hibiki go lord blazer wa2 try destroying world, all gear lost to berzer biki but miku love (song) return her sense, then she use gungnir to fight dainsleif inside herself on the moon ... <br/> </br>  So who will repair the symphogears? Elf Nine, with alchemy magic, or will they go to Dr. Ver to fix them?  <br>Fixed.</br>  <br>It's pretty much un-noticable in the first episode, but side by side it's definitely visible in the second.<br><br>Top is HS, bottom is commie.</br></br></br>  <br> wanting Shirabe to sneeze on Kirika's vagina <br>Gross.</br></br>  <br>I'll take niptext over shit quality encode any day.</br>  <br> will they go to Dr. Ver to fix them? <br>The fact that this possibility exists means that it has to happen.</br></br>  <br>I don't understand how they can break. I thought the symphogears were just shards of complete relics that are brought to full power with phonic gaim. <br>Why would it matter if a shard gets cracked? <br><br>Hibiki used shards of Kanade's armor to turn into gungnir.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The quality of the HS rip was better than that of commie, but commie's subs were better imo. Your call either way.<br><br><br>Totally Ver. It makes the most sense especially considering he was also able to make customised linker.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon, those pink crystals were what made the whole system works. The relic is probably as small as atom now.<br><br>As for Hibiki, she literally fused with Gungnir.</br></br></br>  <br>Someone probably can drop a keyword on this, but even based on this episode you can understand how it works. The pendant itself isn't the relic, it has a shard inside, while the pendant is like a mechanism allowing the user to use it and transform. Arcanoise damaged the mechanism, leaving the shard intact, but without a way to access its power.</br>   Dainsleif <br> Dainsrave <br>Tis' a prophecy</br></br>  <br>My waifu isn't from symphogear.<br><br>There's still no Ver.</br></br></br>     That beef stroganoff song. <br>Literally what.</br>  <br>I think you meant "Literally perfection".</br>  So what's your dream Symphogear episode? Here's mine:<br>Tsubasa gets a booty call from Maria to meet her at the concert arena. She gets there, turns out it was Carol and the concert organizers using a voice modifier. All of the Autoscorers are there too. They've stolen all of her swords and they tell her she has to follow all their instructions and whatever happens to her she has to act like she enjoys it. If she doesn't, they will break all of her swords and get their concerts canceled.<br><br>So the next day, Tsubasa walks into a room wearing diapers and a pacifier, acting like a retarded baby. All of the Autoscorers are there and they give her the hardest, most brutal gangrape in history. As instructed, Tsubasa acts like she completely enjoys it and asks for more.<br>Then in walks that guy Dr. Ver from season 2. Turns out he joined the Autoscorers for revenge. He's been eating a special protein-only diet for weeks just for this. He pulls down his pants and partially defecates the longest, thickest, hardest log ever, and proceeds to use it to give Tsubasa the most furious ass-to-ass action ever recorded. Tsubasa can't hold her tears anymore, but pretends they're from pleasure. It's finally over.<br><br>Then Carol reveals the room they're in is actually see through from the outside, and they're in the concert arena. All of the audience has been watching Tsubasa get gangbanged and enjoy it, and it's been broadcasted worldwide. They finally kick her out of the premises, and break all of her swords anyway.<br><br>Later, Tsubasa runs into Maria, who tells her she didn't know she was such a straight CIS scum. Her lolis walk in and proceed to have passionate sex with her in front of Tsubasa, and after they finish, pee all over Tsubasa, much to Maria's delight<br><br>After the ending credits, Tsubasa is wandering off on a road in the middle of nowhere. A speeding car runs her over and breaks her spine, but it's non lethal. She is left laying there in extreme pain for days, and finally dies of hunger.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Seriously?

It's frustrating.<br><br>I'm really really hoping that next week they surprise me and she gets her mojo back somehow early but I seriously doubt it.<br><br>I'd be satisfied if berzerker mode activates though, that'd be fine.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Hibiki feeling bad for a total of 1 and a half episode <br> WHEN WILL THIS DEPRESSION ARC BE OVER MAN SHE SHOULD JUST PUNCH SHIT AND EVERYTHING WILL BE DAIJOBU <br><br>These are probably the exact same people that bitched about Simon being depressed when Kamina died.</br></br></br>  <br> Hibiki has been dealing with these feelings for over 25 episodes now, and despite all that she's been through it all comes to a head in the worst way possible <br>Yes, that's bad.</br></br>  <br><br>dude you know she's going to be useless for half the show right<br><br>that's how this shit goes</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the thing though - G in itself had poor writing, and people misrepresenting Hibiki because of their poorly formed perceptions from G is exactly why they're so upset right now.<br><br>Her conversation with Maria made it clear that she never grew up at all. All she did was teach Maria how to hold hands, yet somehow people are misrepresenting that and the entire end of G as Hibiki somehow 'evolving' into a mere hotblooded punch vending machine.</br></br></br>  <br>Symphogear simply doesn’t have time for that. We have arcs for all characters and Hibiki has to have some berserk time too, that’s not a lot of screen time spread across 13 episodes.</br>  <br>IMO resolving all drama in one episode would be kinda stupid. What about switching focus to DMJii, so Hibiki can spend some time thinking about her reason to fight and why it's stupid to be depressed over her dad when Genjuro is better dad than anyone could be. Then we get Training Montage and everything is Fine again. <br><br><br> Hibiki has been dealing with these feelings for over 25 episodes now <br><br>This is exactly why it's good she can't sing now. She was running away from problem for two season, hiding behind her friends and sometimes throwing a punch or two. It's now time she finally finds her determination, so we will never have to see depressed Hibiki again.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I do hope Maria uses Gugnir next ep.  <br>Would she get a new song or will it be KORT EL FES GUNGNIR again?</br>      <br>This. I wonder if it's because of the director change.</br>  <br> This is exactly why it's good she can't sing now. She was running away from problem for two season, hiding behind her friends and sometimes throwing a punch or two. It's now time she finally finds her determination, so we will never have to see depressed Hibiki again. <br>It shouldn't take that long for her to actually listen to her friends and to actually learn something from her experiences.</br></br>  <br> IMO resolving all drama in one episode would be kinda stupid. What about switching focus to DMJii, so Hibiki can spend some time thinking about her reason to fight and why it's stupid to be depressed over her dad when Genjuro is better dad than anyone could be. Then we get Training Montage and everything is Fine again.  <br><br>But we've done this shit alreadyyyy<br><br>we've had two seasons of this alreadyyy<br><br>why can't we have a fucking curveball please???</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop posting like a fucking retard.</br>  <br>2ch are a bunch of retards that by shit like Infinite Stratos by the tens of thousands.<br><br>All of the people in that post needed copious amounts of fisting before they became friends, and on top of them Ver never became their friend. Her belief that "I can totally just talk it out peacefully" has never once actually worked.</br></br></br>  <br>The 11 literally explains that was at the end, after the character received a massive ass kicking and had no other choice but to listen. Fine didn't change her mind until she was 10 seconds from dying.</br>  <br> Feelings can't be bottled up and come out at inopportune moments <br><br>Hibiki was always naive as fuck about these things. Her ideals have been consistent as fuck though. "We should talk things out and everything will be fine" has been said throughout the entire show. In season two she goes out of her way to try to save the FIS girls and I don't think she actually hit anyone seriously besides the noise and that relic eater thing.<br><br>She's been hiding her problems for over two seasons as well. All she would do would laugh shit off and pretend everything is ok. Why do you think Miku is getting irritated every time she blew shit off like her abusive dad being a shit and leaving forever? Why do you think she blew shit off like literally having relic cancer?<br><br>Hibiki likely thinks her problems are invalid and doesn't actually talk through them. While simultaneously thinking that every problem can be talked through. Which is absolutely insane. <br><br>There's also the fact we've never had significant development for Hibiki at all. Tsubasa had season one and Chris had season 2. This is Hibiki's season.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>nooooooooooooo</br></br>  Why is Hibiki always such a cunt to poor Miku  <br> Feelings can't be bottled up and come out at inopportune moments <br> Miku has been telling Hibiki not to fucking do that since season 1 <br>She tries to get through to everyone and make them understand what she feels, but the most important person to her tells her to let her own feelings out so others can help her and she reacts in the worst way possible constantly? That's a shit character. "People have emotions and do stupid things" doesn't excuse inconsistent writing when every other character developed over time but Hibiki just kept going backwards.</br></br></br>  <br> Chris had season 2 <br><br>Uh, did she? I totally didn't notice.</br></br></br>  WHEN WILL NANA SING ENKA AGAIN?  <br> Ver never became their friend <br>You can thank Ver taking away the only thing she had in the world (the ability to hold hands), Berserk Hibiki's regenerative ability and the circumstances surrounding the Gungnir Cancer for that. Ver is the exception to the norm, not the norm, and she didn't have to learn a thing from that.</br></br>  <br>Did you somehow missed the 4th episode and her whole endgame play?</br>  <br><br>That's not the whole season though. That's like, an ep and a bit.</br></br>  <br>And Ver was ultimately not dealt with by Hibiki, Genjuro and Ogawa did that. <br><br><br>Not until she pulled down the moon fragment potentially killing humanity which was entirely Hibiki’s fault since she just had to rescue her instead of killing her along with Nehushtan. Somehow the show completely ignores this though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because she is a bad and unhealthy person, and for good reason given the shit she went through. It's not shit writing, it's people having no idea what she's supposed to be like because they have no idea how to interpret the events of G.<br><br>Not even several years of support can make up for that. Tsubasa's BSOD lasted at least 2/3 of that, and she's not as unhealthy as Hibiki.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know what's inconsisent about not wanting the person closest to you not to worry. It's contradicting as fuck but it's hardly uncommon.</br>  <br> they have no idea how to interpret the events of G. <br>and that happens because G was messy as fuck. You can't deny that.</br></br>  <br>Chris stopped being anti-social and learned to trust Tsubasa as a senpai. Now she aspires to be a cool senpai like Tsubasa.<br><br>So yeah, she did have season 2<br><br><br>Hibiki is kind of a shit yeah. Even with season one all she learned to do was not lie to Miku about what she's doing. But she never learned to stop lying to Miku about her feelings. Miku knows about the missions now, but about how Hibiki feels about them? Shit all. Hence we're going back to the "my problems are invalid" issues.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To your credit, I fully agree, but there is enough that can be interpreted from it to make Hibiki's current situation decently understandable and sound from a writing perspective.</br>  <br><br>Even ignoring G, this is stupid as fuck. <br>Hibiki learned to not be a baby in season 1 when standing around uslessly almost got Tsubasa killed. She trained with Genjurou to be a fighter. <br><br>Next time she encountered Chris, she had no problems knocking the shit out of her to make her calm down so she would be willing listen.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even if it's understandable and sound, it is not necessarily what people want to watch.</br>  This scene is probably one of main reasons current events feel out of place for some people. It's hard to notice Hibiki is insane and thinks she has no value if she can't throw away her life when she's manly and awesome as fuck. As much as I love it, it shouldn't happen back then, but later this season.  By the way guys.<br>Where did Maria get that second Gungnir in the first place? You know, back in G.</br>  <br>I guess that was because they didn't expect the show to get a second season.</br>  <br>Probably just a different part of the relic.</br>  <br>Fine made a second Gungnir and gave it to FIS.</br>  <br> Next time she encountered Chris, she had no problems knocking the shit out of her to make her calm down so she would be willing listen. <br>This is my main issue with this development. As a followup from G, I get it, but it just feels inconsistent.</br></br>  <br>It’s worse than that, Miku only knows about the missions because she found out by chance. Hibiki wouldn’t have told her jack shit.</br>  <br>Well, they only need a little piece of relic to make a symphogear. It's not impossible to make hundreds of Gungnir.</br>  <br>I'm sure by episode 7 at the latest, she will be punching things bigger than mountains. She's just going through a phase right now, and once she's snapped out of it, I'm sure she'll finally have found a good reason to fight.<br>I'm rooting for you Hibiki.</br></br>  <br>symphogear is part of a relic, if the Gungnir Spear was broken in 1000 pieces, there can be 1000 gungnir symphogear</br>  <br>We already know that that's most likely going to be the case given the OP. The real question is what's going to happen before then.</br>  <br>And G was a logical continuation. At the start of G when they thought Maria was Fine, Hibiki was upset because she thought Fine learned her lesson. <br><br>Genjurou explained that it doesn;'t matter. They just need to keep fighting until Fine remembers what she learned. Hibki agreed. <br><br>Hibiki wants to be friends, but she isn't retarded.</br></br></br></br></br>  Read the guide before asking anything buyfag related.<br><br>http://buyfag.moe</br></br>  Reminder that this is acceptable condition according to buyfags.  <br>Just be a bother on the figure page about wanting to buy a new box off of someone.<br>Even though I agree that your box arrived in abhorrent condition, GSC won't replace it because it's not their problem and it did the job they claim it's supposed to do.</br></br>  <br>Are you seriously mad at us for not being upset enough?

You can't learn how to stylize a drawing of something unless you know how to draw that something.
