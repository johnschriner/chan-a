[ Ready for the seasonal waifu fags to infest this place?<br><br>Pic related is going to common<br><br> muh pure whores </br></br></br></br>  I hope deaf chinaman fucks her  <br>what a fucking faggot</br>  <br>Like most manga, no one enters relationships. Unless you read doujinshi shit and other crap<br><br>Also spoiler alert  deaf boy and slut girl never bang, deaf boy likes nina who is like 13 </br></br></br>  My question is how that half black half chinese woman got blue eyes  Why would anyone have a waifu from a fujoshit show? Even a seasonal one.  <br>Not waifu material but brown girls makes me diamond, and the fact she's a whore opens the door to some good submissive doujins.</br>  <br>So the brown girl is just there to be a slut? Perfect role for a women.</br>   literally a cum dumpster   Im just hoping artists jump on her and exhentai gets flooded with tons of good shit  <br>Knowing nips, they will totally ignore it because there's already explicit sexual content, like CA or do it wrong and go homolust.</br>  <br> Implying anyone would watch this crap show in the first place. </br>  <br> taking a prostitute as a waifu <br> when theres canonically gay sociopath trap that cums on though of murder and danger </br></br>  Is game of laplace yaoi shit?  <br>Worick and her show interest on each other but nothing much. they're good friends as of now.</br>  <br> kill her pimp <br> you're mine now <br><br>Still tumblr must love it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Yes, just like Sherlock Holmes.</br>  <br> sherlock holmes  <br><br>what</br></br></br>  <br>I can imagine tumblr getting mad because Worick said "she's mine". <br><br>They probably don't understand that it was the only way of saving her, or they do understand but they still get buttblasted</br></br></br>  <br>She likes Nic. Worick just likes to fuck around and flirt.</br>  <br>The fact that there was a woman who isnt trans and tri sexual lesbian stronk independent womYn who dont need no man is enough to piss them off</br>  <br>She's really not the popular type of girls.<br>I could bet that you will be the only one spamming her, if anyone.</br></br>  <br> they will totally ignore it because there's already explicit sexual content, like CA or do it wrong and go homolust <br><br>But my dick needs it.</br></br></br>  <br>Its anime based on novels of most famouse japanese mystery writer, which in turn was Sherlock fan and wrote his characters from him.<br><br>Most of japanese anime mystery fiction ilke Detective Conan, Kindaichi etc. are all inspired or even have direct plot from Edogawa Rampo`s novels<br><br>Note "Edogawa Conan". Kogoro Mori is allusion on his Sherlock clone "Akechi Kogoro" etc.<br><br>That said, it is canonically "gay" story (also it never develops as such, but assumed), since Sherlock and pedo-watson in original 1920+ novels were more than just close friends.<br><br>MC of show looking like androgene trap is correct faithful adaptation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Watson and Sherlock were lovers in the originals? Really? <br><br>Shit man</br></br></br>  <br>Don't get started with this Tumblr shit, the less we talk about it the better it is.</br>  <br>The only respected homolust fanfiction</br>  <br>No she doesn't. She barely sees or hangs with him and when she tries cooking for them only Worick eats it. Most of the time at least.<br>She still respects and wants to get along with him, or doesn't blame him for wanting to kill her, but she never once showed any feeling of that kind against him.</br></br>  <br>The biggest mystery: How are these niggas so gay?</br>  <br>Why did they make noto mamiko voice a character like this. It doesn't fit at all</br>  <br>Either her chinese parent had a white or hispanic parent or grandparent or her black parent did.</br>  <br>She's called Benedetto, no? she has an Italian granddad.</br>  WARNING: DEAD GANGSTA WAIFU SPOILERS<br>Rest in literal pieces.</br>  <br>And dropped</br>  <br>How is that a spoiler? Everyone knows its edgy shit that will only sustain itself by mah descrimination and suffering and killing characters off.</br>  <br> taking a prostitute as a waifu <br>I can think of at least a few respectable waifu choices who are prostitutes.</br></br>  Believe in Taki sensei, he will lead you to s2  Where do I go to find her?  <br>I believe in Taki sensei.</br>  <br>Take your time, novel-kun.<br>I love you.</br></br>  don't waste my time don't fuck up my blankets fagotts    novelfag please answer what happens on volume 4 thanks <br><br/></br>  do reina and shuichi have any interactions on the other volumes?  <br>only if you pray enough</br>      holy shit good fucking thread <br><br><br>thank YOU BASED oboe chan</br></br></br>  <br>I'd follow him</br>  <br><br>Only one way.</br></br>    Why do people want to read spoilers instead of watching S2?  <br>o-ok</br>  <br>THANK YOU BASED OBOE-CHAN</br>  <br>Spoilers don't have yuri.</br>  <br><br>What if S2 never happens?</br></br>  <br>I like to know what to expect.

There’s absolutely nothing wrong in loving a ship because they are lesbians. It’s not like straight people are lacking in representation. But a well developed romantic bond between two intriguing female characters, who share so much screen time, mutual development and love? That’s rare, and more than enough reason to appreciate a ship like this.<br><br>Straight KumiRei would still be a well-developed relationship, but it wouldn’t have piqued my interest at all. And it would change their characters; for example: Kumiko’s overt disinterest in men, and Reina’s likely self-denial of her own lesbianism, wouldn’t very well be factors to take into consideration, were either a dude.<br><br>No, Kumiko and Reina being read as lesbians is incredibly important to me, and my shipping of it. It’s not the only reason to ship them, but I’ll happily admit that nope, I wouldn’t be this emotionally invested if it was just about some straight people, or even two gay boys - there are other series for that. This is rarer, and far more personal and relatable - obviously.<br><br>I ship them because they are both girls, and girls with such shared passion, such wonderful characterization, such wonderful interactions and such wonderful development. For being girls in love. And that is a key part for me, with a relationship this rich, this rare, and this gay.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Have the novels been translated to English?  <br> ... <br>fuck off</br></br>  <br> tumblr </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127503820 <br/>  <br>Please stop copying text from tumblr. It's triggering.</br>  Do any of you have girlfriends. Cause you shouldn't judge.  <br>THANK YOU BASED OBOE-CHAN</br>  <br>Where do you think you are?</br>  <br> So you don't have a girlfriend. </br>  So Shoe-Kumiko hints were in the 1st vol but the anime removed them. Now we have vol 2 and it focuses on the girls and that prick nowhere to be found. Reina x Kumiko still stands strong. I would like another season now.  <br>Midori, your ride's arrived.</br>  <br><br>Kill yourself newfag.</br></br>  <br>What if Kyoani goes full anime original with the second season, with a heavy focus on the relationship of Kumiko and Shoe?</br>  <br>Shuuichi does show up, he also has another comforting scene with Kumiko before Kansai performance since she's nervous again. the Anime just altered their scenes not remove them.</br>  <br><br> heavy focus on the relationship of Kumiko and Shoe? <br><br>No chance. Why start now? The returning 2nd years will get focus.</br></br></br></br>  That was a hell of a last episode. I need S2.  <br>Them, Asuka and Taki sensei.</br>  <br><br>After Hyouka and Amagi season 2.</br></br>  <br>Taki sensei is the real problem, not shuuichi.</br>  <br><br> Shuuichi does show up, he also has another comforting scene with Kumiko before Kansai performance since she's nervous again <br><br>Fuck yeah more stomping and bro fists.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That look 100% murrican fat  ;) </br>  <br>Given how much drama we saw with the band just trying to get into the nationals, this seems like a pretty accurate depiction of how things will look if they make getting gold at the nationals their next goal.</br>  <br><br> she's nervous again <br><br>She should get used to this by now.</br></br></br></br>  Do they play the same piece in each competition?  <br>Why you do this?</br>  <br/>    <br><br>Kumiko holding his trembling fingers was replaced by a fist pump. Why would she get embarassed by that?</br></br>  Please tell me that season 2 is in production.  <br>Nah Free! is.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127503820 <br><br><br>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</br></br></br>  <br>The problems is this<br> Ironically it's Reina who tries to ship Kumiko and Shuuichi together the most. <br>and this</br></br></br>  Trombros4life  <br>How can Taki be so cute?</br>  <br>Taki's brows are really thick.</br>  <br>You know what anon? there isn't really a problem, because Reina and Kumiko are not a thing. They are not in the source material, and they're not officially in the anime, where all you can do is infer and the only canon feelings are those of Shuuichi for Kumiko and Reina for Taki.<br>Why bother answering to yurifags? they've got absolutely nothing factual going in their favor.</br></br>  <br>He's just happy Shuichi didn't fuck sink his hopes and dreams of fulfilling his dead wife's hopes and dreams.</br>  <br>They make him look very cute. It gives him the drowsy, gentle look.</br>  <br>THANK<br>H<br>A<br>N<br>K<br><br>YOU<br>O<br>U<br><br>BASED<br>A<br>S<br>E<br>D<br><br>OBOE-CHAN<br>B<br>O<br>E<br>-<br>C<br>H<br>A<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But all I can think about is caterpillars as his eyebrows.</br>  <br>Are they cute caterpillars?</br>  Full OST when?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=M7n<wbr>vePt83_w</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YHY<wbr>WAXFvs0Q</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>The fact that this is an adaptation and they can change whatever they want. They already did.</br></br>  <br>Its the brown fuzzy ones.</br>    <br>THANK YOU BASED OBOE-CHAN. MAY YOUR REEDS SOAK WELL AND NEVER CHIP.</br>  <br> The fact that this is an adaptation and they can change whatever they want. They already did. <br>Minimal parts faggot, not the story itself.</br></br>  <br>They also changed lots of things in KnK, but it remained loyal to the LN regardless.</br>  <br>But we're not talking about changing the story itself.</br>  <br><br>The story can still be the same with Reina and Kumiko as the end pairing. It's a huge improvement even. Shuichi does nothing to the plot. He's just there for exposition and for self-insert fags.</br></br>  <br>The denial is strong.</br>  <br>If only Aoi-chan was here.</br>  So I want to get Kurosawa's autograph tomorrow. Any AX veterans have advice on how to do so? How early should I get there? Do I need to pay anything?  <br>Shoe1's eye's look captivatingly determined.</br>  <br>Show her the kumikonoises.webm</br>  What's Kyoani doing after Hibike? Any movies or new shows in the coming seasons?  <br><br>Ask if her if Kyoani plans for S2.</br></br>  <br>Hopefully Asuka and everyone else in this photo with  BIG FUCKING EYES  will look better in the BDs.</br>  <br>Get there very very early.<br>Like a 2 hours before the sessions starts.<br>Otherwise you're fucked.</br></br></br>  <br>Didn't you already had this dicussion on /u/? Reina loves Taki, get over it.</br>  <br>You realized that's a fanart, right?</br>  I'm so mad they changed Taki's sensei design so much in the anime. He was a total qt in the manga.  <br><br>ok, I lost it</br></br>  <br><br>I think I'll be asking her to say something in her cactus voice.</br></br>  <br>THANK YOU BASED OBOE-CHAN</br>  <br>You sure?</br>  <br> still using this forced meme <br><br>go back to reddit</br></br></br>  <br>Why are Natsuki and Ribbon grabbing oboe-chan's shoulders like that? Where are they taking her? What are they going to do?</br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127503820 <br>Oh jeez.</br></br>  <br>Oboe really misses flute.</br>  Reina's face when she left the oven on. <br><br><br>Is the flute girl who got chewed out by Taki still there?</br></br></br>  <br> S2 <br><br>Nigga, this ain't Free. HE doesn't deserve a S2, it's too weak.</br></br></br>  <br>Taki was so heartless with her. The dude is a douchebag.</br>  <br>Fuck you and your homolust.<br>HE deserves a S2.</br></br>    <br><br>Yes, she passed her audition. Aoi is the only one that quit.</br></br>  <br>The main story is about the band though, it's not primarily a romance.</br>  <br>Maybe for Kumiko, but can you say the same about Reina?</br>  <br><br><br>She got her smile back.</br></br></br>  <br>Reina is not the main character. Kumiko is and she's always in the middle of band drama.</br>  <br>But you people are trying to put her together with Reina, the one who lives in her own little romantic world.</br>    we need thicker eyebrows  <br>You think I want to put them together? I like Kumiko with Asuka.</br>  What's her shoulder routine? She's fucking jacked.  <br>THANK YOU BASED OBOE-CHAN!</br>  <br>Did he ever get pussy in the end?</br>  Every fucking day. Every single fucking day when i come home this little faggot just sits there and gives me this smug look on her face. What should i do about her?

Someone shops one on her on that ep's 12 scene when she finishes her conversation with Kumiko and walk away.</br></br></br>  <br>they all went to the same middle school together</br>  <br>Smug back at her.</br>  <br>Haruka and Taki jr?</br>  <br>Tell her who best fagott is.</br>  <br>Taki's subplot is more about his past and his wife.</br>  <br>They were 'mirin'.</br>    <br>Nice try, landwhale.</br>  Remember no matter what happens we will sink with the ship even if we have too. Dont regret anything of Kumiko x Reina. We enjoyed every single time they spent together... even if Kyoani will obviously rip out our hearts at the end. I will forever be a KumiRei shipper till the end!! There's no shame in going down with honor after all we have come to get used to the harsh treatments of the anime world towards the yuri fans.Till next time my friends. A forever KumiRei shipper.  <br>tl;dr fuck off back to /u/</br>  reminder that she got the award for best girl  I want to  date  her.    I want to have a threesome with these two  <br> You will never be this happy with the fagotts. </br>    <br>Oh my.</br>  <br>Spoken like a true lanklet.</br>  <br><br>needs moar fluff to be a more believable Kumiko</br></br>  Parallels  So any second- or third-years in Kitauji now were in the same middle school as Kumiko/Reina/Shuu1? Did they know each other (from the band)?  <br> waiting for shit </br>  <br>Something about pots.</br>  <br>ohmagawd</br>  <br>NO THANKS, OBOE-CHAN</br>    <br>Mizore, Natsuki, Nozomi and Yuuko went to the same middle school.</br>    What was he doing?  <br>Thank you based oboe-chan.</br>  <br>Are they celebrating that she died?</br>  <br>It's a music thing. You wouldn't understand</br>  <br>So none of these second-years were in the band? But that's weird because everyone except for Natsuki could play before going to Kitauji.<br><br>Or that all first-years knew the second-years, but the anime didn't show? But if this is the case Kumiko wouldn't even have tried to pretend that she didn't know eupho, because they would all know.</br></br></br>  <br>Hazuki recognises that hand.</br>  That transition to being encouraged and then realising she's still mad at him.  <br>he misread what you wrote<br><br>Natsuki Mizore Yuuko and Nozomi were part of the same middle school but not the same as Kumiko, Shuuichi and Reina. I don't think anyone in the band went to the same school as them. Aoi knew Kumiko and Shuuichi from their childhood though, not sure if they went to the same middle school.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait what? Natsuki hasn't played but she did go to the their local middle school. Nozomi, Yuuko and Mizore played together in their middle school. Nozomi is the girl who rallied the second years tryhards to quit.</br>  Taki is a good husband  Who's cuter?  <br>i had a laugh</br>  <br>I thought that was a picture of loli Reina for some reason.</br>  <br>THANK YOU BASED OBOE-CHAN</br>      <br>looks nothing like her</br>  <br><br> Reina can't even recognize that Kumiko is nervous as hell compared to Midori and Shuichi <br> Reina encourages Kumiko in the audition by squeezing her face <br> Shuichi encourages Kumiko just by using his voice <br><br>Smooth as silk</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She looks like a playful woman.</br>    <br>Taki.</br>  <br>That makes sense.</br>  What in the ever loving fuck is this face trying to say? is it a <br> She doesn't know her own feelings  <br>or<br> I'm glad she's single <br>fuck kyaoni</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Taki-sensei's waifu on the front page!</br></br>  Best mates. <br><br>Nichijou adventures when?</br></br>  <br>Weird I like Nozomi/Natsuki and Mizore/Yuuko more.</br>  <br>Where were you when Ribbon-chan was rekt beyond recognition?</br>  <br>she looks like the kind of girl who would roll around  on blankets </br>  <br><br>Clearly the first one if you think about it since she clearly isn't aiming for Kumiko but Taki-sensei.</br></br>  <br>Imagine their sex life. <br>m<br>a<br>g<br>i<br>n<br>e</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ep11 made me think she was aiming at both of them</br>  <br>Wait a minute, was Kumiko able to play that dificult part? Taki clearly smiled because of Shuichi playing correctly but what about Kumiko?</br>    <br>Hazuki is there to explain to you what happens. She high fives Natsuki because Kumiko played her part.</br>  <br>Best one</br>  <br><br>And episode 12 reminds you again that Reina wants Taki-sensei's D. Trollish isn't it?</br></br>  <br>and episode 12 is there to explain to you that Reina would push Kumiko into a Japanese truck if she went near Taki again</br>  <br>I know, but why would they do it so fucking gay? I mean, you have them inches away from each other's face, the cheek touching, the voice acting, the hand touching. Kumiko's fucking face.<br>For what<br>damn<br>purpose</br></br></br></br>  why does Taki use his hands instead of a baton?  <br>Only amateurs use batons.</br>  <br><br> For what damn purpose <br><br>Because bait.</br></br></br></br>  Was Hazuki thinking of the impasse between Shuuichi and Kumiko or that she still likes him, here?  <br>What the-<br>I live in Peru!<br>Where the fuck are those pictures from, causa?<br>I don´t remember there being any events these past season, mierda.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Has bait ever been this blunt in Kyoani? All I can think is Hiroomi talking sensually to Akihito, but he was always alarmed/annoyed. Kumiko, in the other hand, looks really into it.<br><br><br>Tranquilo papa, taba webiando.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I KNOW<br><br>I KNOW I'VE LET YOU DOWN</br></br></br>  <br>Funny. I always thought Reina reacted like that because Kumiko spent time with someone else when she wasn't doing very well instead of going to Reina.</br>  <br>Hands are usually use for choirs. Batons are good for orchestras. So it is kind of weird.</br>  <br><br>Blunt bait is still bait. Nothing more to it.</br></br>  <br>holy shit..</br>  <br>Batons are only good for very large orchestras, in which the movements may be hard to see for players at the very back. Hands are able to convey a lot more information than just a baton.</br>  <br>Was he  fapping? </br>    Taki really grilled the Trombones hard huh?  <br>He does it for her, anons.

And as each conductor is called up, girls are heard screaming "I LOVE YOU SENSEI". When Taki sensei is called up, Reina screams from the audience "I love you Taki sensei" (Taki sensei, suki desu!). After which Reina buries her face in her hands and starts crying because she instantly regrets her decision. Kumiko tells her it's fine, it didn't even sound like a confession since everyone else was doing it. Then Ribbon comes and thanks Reina for saying what she did because all the girls wanted to say it together but nobody was brave enough. So that's why it sounded like a sign of respect to Taki sensei. Because screaming it from the audience made her sound like a fangirl, not an actual confession. Now what happens after Nationals is that Taki sensei confronts Reina about it, telling her "thank you for cheering me on". At which point Reina then gives a REAL confession, "I love you Taki sensei. The reason why I came here was just for you. I really, truly love you". Taki sensei's response to this one though is very different, as far as using an idiomatic expression. So his response to this is "To be told that as a teacher is more than I deserve, thank you" (literally "I am favored by fortune"). So he establishes in his own Taki sensei way that he and Reina are teacher and student. And then Reina is still extremely happy that she got to confess and runs off to the bathroom because she probably wet herself or something. Asuka and Kumiko are watching the entire thing and are confused at what just happened, not entirely sure if Sensei was serious or not but one of the things in this series is that nobody really knows what Taki sensei is thinking.   fucking phenomenal writing turning Ribbons into one of the best girls    <br>How did she fit that thing in her pocket?</br>  <br>   The reason why I came here was just for you. I really, truly love you </br>  <br> thanks </br>  <br>   is "To be told that as a teacher is more than I deserve, thank you" (literally "I am favored by fortune").

Mizore sees Yuuko and Natsuko doing this, and Mizore asks Nozomi if she wants a special service crepe too but Nozomi says she's fine with a normal crepe.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Surprisingly mature on both ends.</br>  <br>You took too long.

She's in love, but she's not delusional. She was happy because she made progress and finally got the courage to confess. She doesn't take it badly since she doesn't plan on giving up on him. So for her, this just means the next phase is starting.

That didn't happen. Reina is still in love with Taki-Sensei. As long as that's the case, their ship will always be just fan fiction.<br><br>But a lot of people are very emotionally invested in this anime and their ship, so they refuse to face the facts. Now they're trying to justify that they "won" by using the fact that Shuichi-Kumiko reconciliation scene was slightly less romantic than it was in the novels. Despite the fact that Shuichi and Kumiko only reconcile in the first novel, Kumiko doesn't yet realize she loves him, and that Shuichi was never the one who sank their ship.</br></br></br>  I'm from /u/ and hate you hetfags please die  ITT: Burgers in anime      <br>Pity this poor bastard who every time he orders one the world caves in on him, not to mention his cafe, poor hamburger deprived bastard must wander NYC in hunger and pain for his lost hamburgers and chips (french fries to yanks)</br>    <br>Jesus Christ</br>  hambahgah  <br>Heresy.</br>  <br>Who else eats their hamburgers like this?</br>  <br>Not me, I'm a human being.</br>      <br>This guy.</br>  <br>I do, but I remove the bun and slice it separately or eat the bun by hand.</br>     no hamburger-kun yet   <br>that's not how you do it</br>  does japan even like hamburgers?<br><br>that seems to greasy for them.</br></br>  Anyone got this without artifacts?

People visiting carpeted houses have the common sense to remove their shoes if they've been walking somewhere dirty/dusty/muddy etc. Usually there are at least a couple square feet of tiled/linoleum/hardwood flooring at entrances of houses, so that there is room to leave shoes without tracking onto the carpet, commonly in a basket left near the door for that purpose.<br><br>Because the question of shoes its so widely varied/optional depending on the flooring of the house, the weather, where you just were walking etc it is up to whoever is hosting on whether or not shoes go off. For that matter it's also (at least around here) kind of an unwritten faux-pas to take off your shoes if the host -didn't- ask you and there was no obvious precedent for it, especially if you don't know them very well. Basically that says "I don't care if my feet might stink up your house and track foot-sweat on your carpet".</br></br></br>   nips thinking all westerners always wear shoes inside their houses. <br><br>Shit bothers me.</br></br>  <br>Their version of showing emotion in live action shows is hand gestures<br><br>when they're being emotional they put one hand to their heart and the other limply in the air<br><br>when they're scared they put their hands to their faces<br><br>This doesn't make the delivery better, it just makes you look like you don't know how to act.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't have to be grandpa. <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olest<wbr>ra<br>Causes anal leakage as well. <br>It's a fat substitute.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  Shoes off immediately when entering homes, sometimes exception when that isn't practical, like doing work in front and backyard and having to move between the two.<br><br>Shoes off in public buildings absolutely never.</br></br>  <br> not lifting the bowl to reduce travel distance and optimize your eating <br>fucking casuals</br></br>  <br>Japs have their assumptions of shit that they will never get over because they're all xenophobic and think they're better than everyone else.</br>  I've been to friends' houses where they insist I keep my shoes on and I just can't even fathom.  <br> not going barefoot in public restrooms <br>Why even live?</br></br>  <br> not rolling on the floor in public restrooms <br><br>OP do I watch it or do I read the vn?</br></br></br>  Tadaimaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  <br> not going on your hands <br> not being ready for the day when the rogue penises revolt  <br> pissing on the wall just because you've got an untimely boner </br></br></br>  <br><br><br>how are you suppose to eat noodle then? are you going to cut them into tiny pieces or something?</br></br></br>  <br>It's more like a hindrance and a pain in the ass to take your shoes off if you're not just planning to stay that much anyway.</br>  <br>You can't fathom what?

I don't really know why. I've lived here all my life and my family has been here for a long time and I think it's absolutely retarded.

That hurt like a motherfucker.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  This thread is fascinating the fuck out of me. I live in Canada, and the thought of wearing shoes inside never crosses my mind, and I've never once been to someone's house that does. Reading about people saying they don't at their own house, and they kind of wait until they're told the rules when they go to other houses is just blowing my mind. Like, when it rains or something, do you just slop right the fuck into your living room? At bedtime, when you change into your pajamas, do you keep your shoes on, or do you have another pair meant for sleeping in? Do you wake up, and squeak your sneakers into the shower? And if you don't do any of those things, where the fuck do you put them when you remove them, if not on some kind of shoe shelf or other setup in your entryway?  <br>It really is more sanitary.</br>  <br>If I pull them off, would you die?</br>  <br>Then they just get dirty again.</br>  <br>This, seriously what the fuck? And who doesn't realize they stepped in dog shit?<br/></br>  <br>I have tile so it's not really an issue. I only request shoes come off if guests are going upstairs where we have carpet.</br>  <br> very ill if you try to ingest urine <br><br>No it doesn't, professional piss drinker here. Still alive.</br></br></br>  Well yea, I don't want my shoes to be jacked by some weirdo shoe thief who stakes out near houses and steals any stray shoes.  <br> At bedtime, when you change into your pajamas, do you keep your shoes on, or do you have another pair meant for sleeping in? <br>Jungle boots usually. Ready if you need to get up, not too warm if you don't.</br></br>  <br>That has literally never even happened once.</br>  <br>I think this is a worldwide thing not an American only thing, except for Japan.</br>  <br>Let me break it down for you. <br><br>In a standard house/apart/whatever, you've got a tile/hardwood area by the door/entranceway, that's where you take off and leave your shoes. <br><br>It throws us off, cause in Japan that entranceway is off liimts for shoes, and instead the area to take our shoes off in is right before it, in a lowered area that's typically the color of cement, aka not a color you'd normally think to take your shoes off on or step on with just socks. <br><br>Worse than that though was not being able to wear shoes in the schools. The little slipper things they gave us didn't even reach my heel.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>having those gross-ass squat-toilets in many public venues.<br><br>those gross communal wooden ladels for drinking shrine water.<br><br>public bathing in general.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this is actually making me mad as fuck. are aps really this stupid? <br><br>What the fuck do they think we do with our shoes?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't wear socks in my house but when I'm at someone else's house then yeah I do</br>  <br>It would be incredibly stinky!</br>  <br>If you're chilling at home going about daily life after school/work/NEETdom or whatever, your shoes are always off to begin with. You only put them on to go outside.</br>  <br>But how can the shoes be off to begin with if you don't take them off when you get home?</br>  <br>I wonder if they know most people wouldn't just walk into their home with dog shit on there shoes, most sensible people would use a hose or something and clean it off.<br>We're not literal apes.</br></br>  <br>That's a big foot.</br>  <br>In the corner of whatever room your in when you decide you don't want to be wearing shoes anymore.<br><br>In your shoe closet if you feel willing to walk over there.</br></br></br>  <br>Please tell me you're being facetious.</br>  <br>For you.</br>  It depends. <br><br>No one just sits around with their shoes on in their own home. You only put your shoes on if you're heading out the door. <br><br>When you go to someone else's house, you only take your shoes off if you're asked to (which happens frequently enough). Taking your shoes off without being asked to would be seen as being overly-familiar and rude. <br><br>We have these wonderful inventions called doormats by the way.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If your shoes are wet or muddy you just take them off, not hard. Only people who are anal retentive would always remove shoes here (Ausfail shitpost central).</br>  <br> facetious </br>  <br>epic meme bruh</br>  Japanese people wear shoes at work though, don't they? Why do they think it's so disgusting to wear shoes at home, and even have special indoor shoes for school, but think it's fine to wear shoes around the office?<br><br>What sort of warped logic do they use to make that distinction?</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty much dead serious. It just isn't something people do in Canada (at least anywhere around where I live). It's always been in the back of my head, since most live action TV series and movies are made in America, and they ALWAYS have their shoes on in their houses. When I was younger I just played it off as a sort of "don't believe everything you see on TV", then when I got older I figured it would just be weird for the actors to not be wearing shoes on a set while they're working. But now I know that this is just how it's done across the border.</br>  <br>using common words is fedora now?</br>  <br> people are born with shoes <br><br>How can shoes be real, if people aren't real?</br></br></br>  <br>Are you seriously using le fedora maymay because he used a word that's at a 9th grade reading level rather than a 7th grade one?</br>  <br> amerifats <br> not apes </br></br>  <br>Thing is, whether you're walking through mud or walking down a sidewalk, shoe get dirty. They may not look it visibly, but they do. You wouldn't lick the bottom of a shoe you just walked around town in. In that sense, wearing shoes in your house dirties your house. Now, the difference between a house and an office is that one of them is cleaned by you, and one is cleaned by hired help, unless you have a housekeeper or something.</br>  <br>I think that's a side effect of both a.) the actors not wanting to walk around on sets in their socks because they are at work, and subconsciously you just don't take off your shoes at work and so it doesn't even pop up as off in their minds, and b.) the producers/directors consider it gross/unsightly/unnecessary for the audiences to have to look at peoples' socks or bare feet on national TV.</br>  <br><br>Its rude to take off your shoes in other peoples house, but unless you are leaving right away, almost everyone takes off their shoes at home.</br></br>  I have a lady that comes 3 times a week to clean my house, so I honestly don't care if my floor gets dirty. I do take my shoes off when I get into my room though, no idea why, just an old habit.  <br>Which is why I thought it was a fictional depiction of life in an American household. But then I learned that they actually do that.</br>  Shoe removal anons check this: a few years ago I went barefoot all summer, so long as the ground wasn't hot enough to physically burn me. I go outside at least a dozen times during a day/night period and stepped on all kinds of bugs and slugs during the night. then I would walk back into my house without giving a fuck. I only cleaned my feet during daily showers. <br><br>Is that more gross than just wearing shoes all the time?</br></br>  <br>The point is is that they would notice it. What if they noticed after they were walking around their house?</br>  <br>Well, something like 30% of your body heat is lost through your feet.

I suggest you invest in a pair.</br></br></br>  <br>Not an American, but I do it at my place because it's all tiles or wood and my shoes are usually very clean, and I find it comfier than bare feet/socks. As soon as it's carpet in a home the shoes come off, but for stores I keep them on.</br>  <br>That's not a nice way to refer to your mom.</br>  <br>Well, if you're also stomping on bugs and slugs in your shoes, then there isn't much difference.</br>   Not wearing socks indoors <br><br>Literally best of both worlds</br></br>  <br>I'm Canadian and I've never been in a single house where you didn't remove your shoes inside.<br>I am gullible though so for all I know, you faggot americans are just pretending and you do actually follow this simple respectful habit like normal people do.</br></br>   can't wear comfy socks in my apartment because my roommate is really cleanly and cleans the wooden floors all the time so I slip all over the place in socks <br><br><br>I've busted my ass 5+ times because of this.</br></br></br>  <br>Southern Californian here. It mostly depends on where you live and how much driving you do, as well as the kind of household you live at.<br><br>First, there's not too much snow and rain. That sort of affects how much of a mess your shoes make in the house. If all you're tracking in is dust from the walk to and from your car both ways, then leaving your shoes on is hardly a bad thing. However, if it rained, if you stepped in something messy, or if you have cause to remove, you remove.<br><br>Plus, what could possibly be more orgasmic than walking into the house, trodging over to the nearest couch, slouching over onto it, and removing your shoes and leaving them lying dead by the feet?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I bet you're hilariously fat.</br>  <br>Sometimes, but usually you just follow what the owner does. If they take of their shoes you do, if not then you dont. I personally take off my shoes most the time just because its polite. Leave your socks on though</br>  <br><br><br>6'3" 170 so no. I swear my roommate does this on purpose to fuck with me.</br></br></br>  Do you not have slippers in America?  <br>Since he's saying he wasn't wearing shoes, he likely isn't American, and is therefore probably not fat.</br>  <br> You wouldn't lick the bottom of a shoe you just walked around town in. <br>Yeah but I wouldn't lick my fucking carpet either, even if I'd just vacuumed. Your floor doesn't need to be that clean, and socks you've been wearing all day are pretty gross anyway, as aer bare feet that have been in socks and shoes.<br><br>As long as you use a door mat and don't track visible mud or dirt inside, wearing shoes inside is fine. I personally take mine off when I get home, but not at the door or anything.

This show stole soooooo much from DBZ and Hunter x Hunter. It's hard to see it as anything but a cheap imitation of the two.<br><br>5. Season 1 of Naruto implied that to be great, you had to work hard. Shit pudding devolved into ninja wizards all trying to have the best eyes.<br><br>6.

Prove me wrong.<br><br>Protip:  You can't <br><br>Literally every single problem with this series can be traced to that one single plot point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  I can't imagine the weight of your fedora. <br><br>Go watch SAO like a good bitch.</br></br></br>  It went from being about ninjas to being about battlemages with super eye powers and muh darkness.  <br>Indirectly, yes.<br><br>However, there were so many, SO MANY times this could've been avoided, from Kakashi actually having a mature discussion with him about it rather than tying him to a tree and talking down to him, to Tsunade posting a fucking ANBU guard on him, rather than just let him fuck off.<br><br>Hell, you could go so far as to blame Orochimaru for biting him, or Danzo for taking Shisui's eye, stopping him from casting Kotoamatsukami on his clan and halting the coup. So many people have small claims in the problems.</br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone else preferred Sasuke's portrayal in early part 2 when Yahagi was still there? At least then he actually had a fucking aura while staying in the gray area.<br><br>Everything after obtaining the MS (which was when the new editor took over) fucking ruined him.</br></br>  <br>Sasuke's entire character arc is just a bastardization of Kurapika and Majin Vegeta</br>  <br>Nobody did that last one in hxh.</br>    <br>He was sperging like a whiny bitch after getting anal raped by Nardo &amp; E-touch. It was the Sound 4 that started this mess.</br>  <br>Fuck you faggot</br>  Orochimaru got away with it.  <br>Well, more Orochimaru than the Sound Four. Either way, *post a fucking ANBU guard on the last loyalist Uchiha*. It's not like nobody knew about it - at the very least Kakashi knew that Sasuke was rapidly becoming disenfranchised with the Village and he knew Orochimaru was gunning for Sasuke. Did he just...decide it wasn't worth bothering Tsunade with?</br>   too much credit for eye hax that all sasuke do now are spamming eye hax skill <br> the introduction to powerful senjutsu that has no weakness unless counter with another senjutsu <br> shitty plot development (orochimaru get away with everything, sasuke get away with everything and was never punished, madara got 1 shot without fighting new powered up naruto, sauce, konan got killed for nothing) <br> sakura is actually salad's parent making the entire gaiden pointless <br> rinnegen and sage mode and other power level shit that cannot be counter without plot armor <br> under appreciate jutsus and characters <br> shitty world building (like has anyone gives a fuck about any other villages other than konoha?) </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean back when he wasn't "evil" and pretty much was Vergil, that is on a quest for power to fulfill his goal? Yeah. Right after Itachi died was the complete downfall and invalidation of Sasuke Uchiha.</br>  <br>Isn't he under probation? Yamamoto seems like his parole officer.</br>  Remember back when having the Sharingan actually meant something and it was a real 'Oh shit' moment when Itachi activated his, rather than just 'Oh. Another Sharingan/form of Sharingan/evolution of Sharingan. Woo.'  <br>Except for bon, who within the first 10 seconds said he'd be the best Hunter</br>  <br>Yamato basically sits outside and watches the entrance. That's it. Doesn't go inside, doesn't see any experiments, basically makes sure Orochimaru doesn't go places. Which doesn't mean shit considering Orochimaru is fully aware of Yamato anyway.</br>   Naruto thread <br> as reddit is crashing <br>nice!</br></br>  <br>So it's like house arrest?</br>  <br><br>What I mean is that the quality of the series begins its downward spiral from that plot point onwards. Not to say that the series was high quality before, but when the story becomes about Sasuke, it becomes all about his DARKNESS and Naruto being gay for him which in turn sets up all the other plotpoints and retcons you mentioned.<br><br>I believe that had Kishimoto made Sasuke stay and chose not to turn him into some kind of anti-hero, this entire series would have probably continued to follow the same tone it had been following since the Chuunin exams which was more about worldbuilding and ninja school kids going on missions to far off places.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm assuming so. Although there's no way that Orochimaru doesn't have SOME way to get between hideouts, whether it's reverse summoning or other snakey shenanigans.</br>  <br>As long as Aizen preforms the ceremony.</br>  I'm wondering if Suigetsu will actually apologize to Salad and tell her the truth along with delivering a new pair of glasses.<br><br>I'd like to think he will. I'd think Karin would more or less make him.</br></br>  <br>Yep. He wasn't perfect or anything but was a hell of a lot better (his fights included) than the shit-stain we had to put up with afterwards.<br><br>Sasuke's Arc was wrapped up and should've died alongside Itachi if this was gonna happen.</br></br></br>  <br>I was thinking that as well. Like Orochimaru doesn't go out and start shit because Yamamoto is out there, it's because he doesn't feel like it.<br><br>Well, then again if he pushes his luck too far he'd have to end up dealing with Naruto, and even though he may not be as tough as he used to be, he'd still be able to handily take out Orochimaru.</br></br></br>  <br> I guess I'll just keep doing whatever Itachi tells me to do, forever. <br><br>Way to carve your own path Sasuke.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't mind that Sasuke left (apart from the fact that I was way too emotionally invested in the anime for my own good), since it set up a good sort-of arc for his retrieval. However, I DO think they took his Dark'n'Edgy a bit too far, and his power-ups for each boss-figure defeated became ridiculously insane.<br><br>I would've liked Sasuke heading off, getting a bit on the evil side, and then TnJ'd back way before he actually decided to fight alongside Naruto again.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, the threat of Super Ninja Jesus 1 and 2 coming down on him like a ton of bricks if he tries any more world domination is certainly a factor.<br><br>However, Orochimaru's first, main and still-ongoing goal is to achieve true immortality and master every jutsu to ever exist. He can wait out Naruto, Sasuke, Yamato, all of them. He doesn't care if it takes one year, five years, fifty years or two hundred years. Sooner or later, they'll be dead and he'll be nothing more than a legend. And that's when World Domination v2.0 starts.</br></br></br>  <br> crashing <br><br>Ayy wut?</br></br></br>  <br>It's like a really, really shitty clone of HxH. I didn't even know that till HxH went on netflix and I decided to give it a go, I had always put it off because I disliked the art style of the promo covers.<br><br>HxH is actually good. Naruto is shit.</br></br></br>    <br>A clone is still better than part 2 Nardo</br>  <br>That sounds terrible. The world had nearly ended only for one loose end to possibly fuck that all up somewhere down the line?<br><br>In that case that just leaves open for a time traveler.<br><br>Naruto's future Trunks?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At least Naruto had the decency to finish and not go on hiatus every other chapter.</br>  <br>It was good.<br><br>Then Shipudden happened.</br></br></br>  <br>HxH went to shit after Greed Island (don't get me started in CA either)</br>  <br>This. Part 2 was godawful.</br>  <br>The whole site is throwing a temper tantrum because a mod got fired or something.</br>  <br>Fuck, really? I just finished Greed Island and it's been nonstop entertaining.</br>  Not enough focus on better characters, like Rock Lee.  <br>I'd argue Naruto's chunin exams were better than HxH</br>  <br>He's wrong don't worry.</br>  <br>Nah, even if some of it was ripped off they're too different. It's an insult to hxh to even call it a clone, they handle things too differently.<br><br><br>ca arc is the most well written arc and makes the rest look comparatively shallow.</br></br></br></br>  <br>edgelord sasugay happened<br>it was fine until the chunnin exams<br>then just after the third died it went to shit<br>it seemed like kishi didn't knew what to do after that</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd like to see Rock Lee square off against Sasuke to the death. Literally the only reason Madara survived the Night Guy is because he was in Six Sage Chakra mode at the time and the quick regeneration healed him.<br><br>I feel like Sasuke would get steamrolled after about Six Gates. If Guy hadn't stopped the Sasuke v Lee fight pre-Chuunin exams, Sasuke would've flat-out lost.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, it only got godawful when the war arc started. Until that point it was pretty good.</br>  <br> Sasuke Retrieval arc was shit <br><br>Fuck off</br></br></br>  <br> I would've liked Sasuke heading off, getting a bit on the evil side, and then TnJ'd back way before he actually decided to fight alongside Naruto again. <br><br>That would have worked too.</br></br></br>  <br>Well that was also before he awakened to his "I win" eyes.</br>  <br>it was ok<br>should have ended with sasuke dying</br></br>  <br> Admitting the majority of HxH is shit <br><br>Good to know anon<br><br><br><br>Get ready for DBZ-tier pacing and shitty expositions galore, which isn't even a third of the rest of the Arc's problems.<br><br><br><br>Keep shilling faglord</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Time to leave Narutards.  <br>He should've died after fighting Itachi, his entire character went to shit afterwards</br>  <br>  Sasuke leaves <br>  Trains under Orochimaru <br>  Gets edgier <br>  Gets told Village ordered Itachi to kill clan <br>  110% edgy <br>  Fights Naruto, beats him, doesn't kill <br>  More sure of himself <br>  Takes on Itachi <br>  Pretty much ends the same way as in the show <br>  Realises that Itachi did what he had to because he loved the Village <br>  Actually listens to Itachi beseeching him to protect the Village <br>  Naruto in some sort of trouble in one of the fights, I dunno <br>  Chidori flash <br>  Sasuke standing over Naruto, reminiscent of the Haku fight <br>  Still useless, holy fuck, get to your feet Jesus Christ Naruto <br><br><br>Who, Sasuke? Doesn't really matter - Madara had Rinnegan and still would've died if not for Six Paths chakra.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what if he had siblings?that is just rude,shouldn't you say your mom didn't abort you in time.</br>  <br>He was never that good of a character to begin with. You can't exactly do much with someone who "doesn't like anything". <br><br>But at least there was fucking something before he started being whoever was the villain of that day's bitchboi.<br><br>Oh well. At least he gave us pic related.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One of the things I liked about the Gaiden is how they tried making Salad's puny li'l single tomoe a big deal. While all the other ridiculous eyehax faded into the background, her getting that stupid little apostrophe on her eye actually carried some weight.</br>  <br>Probably. She is wearing two different pairs of glasses in the trailers. That or SP made a fuckup.</br>  <br>All agreed the Sarada is best Uchiha please stand up<br><br>Hokage material for sure</br></br></br>  <br>Now comparing those to the ones we see later on. Different color and design.</br>  <br>"Dad, I have a Sharingan."<br>"One tomoe? ONE TOMOE? YOU'RE NO DAUGHTER OF MINE!"</br></br>  <br>Which is why i said "while not perfect or anything", his grey persona was far less retarded than what he ended up to be.</br>  <br>No wonder he trained Bort instead.</br>  <br>"But dad, he doesn't even have the Sharingan!"<br>"Give him yours then, Sage knows they're wasted on you."</br></br>  <br><br> sharingan <br> has prescription eyeglasses </br></br></br>  I'm sorry but who is this "Yahagi" nigga that some anon mentioned earlier in this thread?  Kishi wrote things as it went on and didn't really stick to any sort of philosophy other than "Make things EVEN BIGGER".<br><br>The story of an outcast becoming the greatest ninja ever through sheer hard work and a little bit of luck becomes pointless when the main character is genetically given everything in the damn world.<br><br>Really the manga went from "Hard work and guts" to "Bloodlines". Those are both perfectly fine themes but in Naruto's case a lot of the characters were unable to compensate for the change. Lee, Gaara, Neji and other characters were all written to be the outcast who has to rise above the challenge to succeed, so when the manga became about blood feuds and whatnot all of those characters were lost in the dust and replaced with a bunch of 1 dimensional characters whose only relevancy was "He's the father/mother/sister of etc etc".<br><br>Mix that with an absurd level of power ups, creatively stagnant fights and lots of LOTS of dragging on for the sake of length and you get one shittastic manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Original editor or Naruto. Then he was reassigned and new guy came and told Kishy to write about Sasuke more because he's more popular than Naruto.</br>  <br><br>But we were given the greatest love story ever told.</br></br>  <br>Between two boys.</br>  <br><br>Fine. The two greatest love stories ever told.</br></br>  <br>Karin isn't the mother BUT we don't see anyone explaining that to Sarada, just Karin shouting at Suigetsu. As far as we know Sarada STILL thinks her dad fucked some side chick and dumped the baby (Sarada) to his "wife" Sakura.</br>  <br>Filler.</br>  <br>I think she realizes she's Sakura's when she's looking at her fist after chakra punch with a surprised expression.</br>  <br>Woah when did this shift happen?</br>  <br>I'm going to guess after the Bridge arc.</br>  Kishimoto can't write for shit. For one he piles on plot twists on top of each other and then resolve in cheapest way possible resulting in characters looking like assholes or retards. And second he's insanely bad with character interaction because he himself is an autistic shut-in and have no idea what friendships and relationships look like.  <br>WHAT? It's a fighting technique, you don't inherit that shit. This is hamon users having hamon using kids retarded. You need to train that fucking shit.</br>  <br>This is<br><br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/125696<wbr>298/#125698996</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>And you're expecting Kishy's writing to not be retarded?</br>  <br>I genuinely think that losing his long sleeved shirt was the worst thing ever to happen in Naruto.<br><br>It just looks so much better than anything that came after.</br></br></br>  <br>For all the shitty DBZ fillers SP makes in Naruto character interaction is one thing they have over manga, they hang out there, discuss random shit and can even have fun, Kakashi's mask filler and Suigetsu's search for zabuza's beheader filler make Sasuke a lot better character than he is depicted by Kishy. I also like Gaara's fangirls fillers, those chicks are funny.</br>  <br>Shirt, maybe, at least it was better than his jrpg-tier belt outfit for chuunin exam finals. But you can't honestly like that retarded massive cable he's using as a belt. It makes him look as fat as Chouji.</br>  It turned into a fucking stupid shitty power level manga. It's also edgy as fuck and I can never take Naruto seriously. What started off as a SOMEWHAT decent manga about Ninjas is now one of the shittiest anime/manga of all time, and the bastard Narutards make it worse.  <br><br>In my personal opinion, just in hindsight, even the Part 1 fillers where Naruto just hangs out and goes on missions with Shino, Hinata, Shikamaru, Iruka, etc. handle the character interactions and development better. It's a shame that Kishi couldn't be bothered to do more stuff along those lines himself.<br><br>Maybe had Sasuke come back to the good side earlier, there could have been more breaks in between the major plot points just devoted to various ninja stuff and shenanigans.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was pretty good until after the fight between Naruto and Sasuke AKA where the fillers started. And everything past that was mediocre or shit. Mostly shit.</br>  <br>Meh, it's not too big.<br><br>Pretty stupid though.</br></br></br>  <br>I want her to become Hokage<br>She is an Uchiha done right</br></br>  Hunter fags are really this butt-blasted<br><br><br><br><br>Reminder that HxH threads are pure samfaging.</br></br></br></br></br>  ITT: Worst girls in their respective series        So much shit taste in this thread.      <br>Shit taste general?</br>            <br>OP said worst, not best.</br>  <br><br>You mean best girls.</br></br>  <br>OP, we all know that the filthy hobbit was the worst girl in that show.

That is Yukino's thing, not fucking Yui's. Do you want even watch the damn show?</br>  <br><br>Same Yuckynofag.</br></br>  <br>Please. Only you went butthurt and autistic to defend yourself, THK. You still can't deny links that shows all your autism and posting style. Fuck off.</br>  <br> things that never happened </br>  <br>stay obsessed. Maybe one day THK will materialize from your delusions.</br>  <br> THK is this mad and delusional </br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Samefag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> autism </br>  Freedom descending to Earth and kicks everyone ass. Best gundam moment ever.  <br> anyone who hates my girl is a samefag <br><br>This is why Yuckynofags are the worst.</br></br></br>  <br><br> https://archive.moe/a/search/text/<wbr>moe%20yuckyno/</wbr> <br>Denial won't change facts. Quit samefagging already.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You already replied.</br></br>  Did you ever consider that this guy is just trying to derail threads by randomly calling someone his memename? That none of this is real and you are just feeding his trolling by trying to argue with him?  <br> yuckyno is exclusively used by the same person 100% of the time, I swear! <br><br>You're so fucking pathetic.</br></br></br>  <br><br>At this point, THK haters are worse than the actual poster. I remember Saekano threads being ruined at the mention of his name.</br></br>  <br> TLK is this mad and delusional </br>  <br> I swear, there are other shitposters who are as bad as me that uses my forced meme that I recently kept forcing! <br>Sure thing.</br></br>  <br>Lurk more. THK is a real shitposter, newfag.</br>  <br>There are. You probably don't even know anything about Yahari threads on /a/. How about you read post by post the link you posted and see how multiple posters have used it?</br>  <br> Yuckyno <br> forced meme <br><br>She's just a shitty girl, of course people would make nicknames of her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Raildexfag here. I can vouch for THK's existence.</br>  <br>Yup.</br>  <br>That's just the surface. Index threads even have a cult dedicated to guess what "THK" is up to IRL.</br>  <br>Case in point </br>  <br> multiple posters <br>Prove it. You can't. Fact is, THK was the one who started forcing it weeks ago and he continues so now. No other fans at that point stooped low as him when he was shitposting by making up all kinds of names for Yukino. Cuck was his favorite word before he switched to Yucky.<br><br><br>Keep forcing it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats exactly the point. He pops in, mentions memename, and keeps at it until the entire thread goes to shit.</br>  <br> I speak for everyone <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>Tsunderefags are a bunch of insecure manchildren. They need to pin the blame of the hate and shitposting their waifus get on a boogeyman to feel better about their tastes.</br>  <br>Calling THK a meme won't make him any less of an autistic shitposter, you know. Why are you so bent on defending THK anyways? Unless of course you're THK himself or his apologist because he likes the girl you like.</br>  <br> There he is </br>  <br> doesn't deny it <br> jumps on the THK shitposting train again <br><br>As expected.</br></br></br></br>   all THK accusation posts are outside post time limit <br>Classic. You people are retards for falling for this shit.</br>  <br> muh us vs tsunderefags post <br> boogeyman <br>You're typical as fuck, THK.</br></br></br>  <br>Yuckynofags are ESL scum. Classic.</br>   There are fags right now defending THK <br>As someone who first met THK in BD threads and seen the shit he has done all by himself, it disgusts me when I see newfags who don't know better thinks it's some made up boogieman That faggot is real as tripfag, just without a trip.</br>  <br> fags <br>More like THK is samefagging and one other guy is sucking on his dick.</br></br>  <br>You're THK as fuck, THKfag.</br>  <br><br> samefagging <br><br>OH THE IRONY</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>THK has some fucking great taste. Megumi, Silver, Hatoko, the list goes on and on.</br></br>  <br> Look, I did it again! </br>  <br>Your typical THK propaganda fails to be believable to anyone who has spent at least a year here. <br><br>Why are you so obsessed with THK again? Were you here for supreme shiposters like gorespammer or the plethora of tripfags who have done infinitely more damage?</br></br></br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/search/text/y<wbr>uckyno%20himeragi/<br><br>Reminder. THK is worse than LRD.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br> look, I blamed THK for everything again! </br>    <br> Megumi <br> Silver <br> Hatoko <br>Literally shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> replying to yourself </br>  You know, this thread was going along perfectly fine before you showed up and started shitposting. Even if your precious boogyman was here everyone was just ignoring him like we do with any other faggot and continuing on like normal.<br><br>Congrats on causing exactly what you claim you are trying to stop. Promptly kill yourself.</br></br>  <br><br>Eririfag get out.</br></br>  <br>You are literally shit.</br>  <br>What did you expect? People who shove this THK garbage down everyone's throats have brain problems.</br>  <br>I was in the last BD thread we had last night. THK is the only shitposter left who still shiposts. His posts get deleted, but he still wants a word him so he replies again saying the same time thing. And he even waits for hours until the thread is dead to sagepost his typical a shit. A SHIT for another final word in to claim some victory he has in his retarded head. He does his every time across every series he follows, but Yahari, BD, KoreZombie, and Inou gets it worse.</br>  <br>Megumi is okay. But Silver and Hatoko are worst girls.</br>  <br> replying to yourself again <br><br>Man, at least try to be subtle. You're pretty embarrassing.</br></br></br>  <br> Derailing a shit thread <br>I don't see a problem.</br></br>  <br> he's mad because his waifu was posted </br>  <br> Biased writing <br> Shifts blame even though he wasn't ignoring and was siding with THK <br>THK apologist spotted.</br></br></br>  <br>Mai waifu didn't get posted though. Are you sure you aren't the one who is mad instead? You sound awfully defensive because someone posted girls you like, so you attacked and kept attacking.</br>  <br>But he's right. This is a hate thread, but only you have to make a ruckus when it comes to tsundere hate. No one else gets autistically mad and tries to find a spacegoat when people post their favorite girls in a thread like this.</br>  <br> there is only one shitposter in the entire world <br> every other person in the entire world agrees with me and likes the same things as me <br>Are you Republican by chance?</br></br></br>  <br>I was there too . THK will deny it, but it has gotten to a point where he shows up like clockwork to spam/samefag and everyone else now works to ignore him.</br>  <br>But I want to inseminate her while sucking on those fat titties.</br>  <br> you did it again </br>  <br> he's <br> he <br>Heh.<br><br>No one else but you go full sperglord like an underage kid raging and shitposting on girls who are mainly tsundere. It's not a matter of hate, but fact is you're about the only shitposter who uses /b/ tier nicks and insults. Calling you out isn't the same as saying only you hate such and such. That's not the point at all.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Hey samefag-kun, don't ignore my question<br/></br></br></br>  <br> going for personal attacks <br><br>Nice way to weasel your way out of the confrontation.</br></br></br>  <br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;122912885 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;122925053 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;123475895 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;123453665 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;123646058 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;124365855 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;124125759 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;124682114 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;124401423 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;125681339 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;125698823  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;125783360 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;125792626 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;125818786 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;125863040  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126016411 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126050238 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126239503  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126378406  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126599995  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126596641 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126751252  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126794272 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126925240  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127050828  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127067418  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127120965  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127136001  <br> <br> <br><br> Almost all of the girl he zealously hates and go full autism over <br> THK leaving his signature shitpost a minute away from the thread falling off <br>Reminder.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No one else but you go full sperglord like an underage kid raging and shitposting <br>Except that is exactly what you are doing.</br></br>  <br> Pot calling the kettle black <br><br><br>See </br></br></br></br>  <br>THK will defend this.</br>  <br> everyone else now works to ignore him <br>Except for you. You have made over 30 posts in this thread that have nothing to do with this thread and only talk about your tripfag crush.</br></br>  <br>Let me guess, photoshop right? You are so predictable.</br>  <br>Not him, but gorespammer was short-lived and he was only after one show and Shaft trolling, all of which came to past eventually. Tripfags are easily ignored or filter. On the other hand, THK can't be filtered and THK has been going on for at least 3 years. There are some (idiots) get trolled by THK or those who copy him, much like how gorespammer had trolls who copied him in trolling BMG and Shaft. At this point, THK does more damage, his targets are more expansive and he has ruined more fanbases than gorespammer. LRD is also in the same boat, but he's tons better than THK.</br>  Man this board has really gotten to shit, I can't even say I like any character who's remotely  tsundere  without creating a shitstorm.  <br>Except I'm pointing out your faulty thinking and autism. Are you really that sensitive? Do your feelings get hurt when someone badmouths your waifu and so you have to initiate a campaigh against those mean and bad bullies?</br>    <br>See </br>  <br><br>Something tells me you are in for a world of   disappointment  </br></br>  <br>Gorespammer was a huge deal for the board in general. In that sense, THK doesn't come even remotely close.</br>  <br>You took that as implying samefag when the point was to show the real underage shitposter with the /b/ tier insults and nick? Feeling insecure, are we?<br><br><br>See above.</br></br></br></br>  Mugi<br>Marika<br>Rei<br>Chi Chi<br>Sakura<br>Nico Robin<br>Rin</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>rei best girl<br><br>asuka a shit</br></br></br></br>  <br> THK stalkers <br>Creepy.</br></br>  THK a shit. A SHIT.  <br> was my first post. You have the wrong guy. This thread went meta and is discussing about THK. It's only proper I join in to voice some truth. You're in this too and arguing anyways, you know.</br>  Posting worst girl.  <br>Remember the five minutes where she was the hottest shit since Chaika's ass hole?</br>  <br>this, so annoying</br>  <br>Oh so its my fault and you are completely blameless for doing the exact same thing? Grow up.</br>  <br>How does that make what you are doing any better? If you want to complain about shitposters maybe you should stop being one.</br>  worst girl  <br>Agreed.</br>  <br>Don't be confused, anon. There were two gorespammer: the original who spammed gore threads/dump gore and the guy BMG fans a labeled as gorespammer in remembrance to the original because he had similar spams and hate for BMG (minus the lack of gore dumps). The latter is the one I'm talking about and he wasn't acknowledged by the board (those who didn't like BMG or Shaft because otaku pandering etc have doubted gorespammer's existence and all that), he was mostly a topic in BMG threads where fans connected the dots and promptly called him out.<br><br>Funny or not, I used to collect archive threads of gorespammer's activity via notepad to help connect the dots of his postings. I still have it somewhere in one of my externals.</br></br></br>  <br> Nisekoi: Tsugumi <br>if anyone deserves that crown its shitoge</br></br>  <br>Worse than Megumi.</br>  <br>You mean best, enjoy your shitty tsundere.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br> &lt;You specifically<br><br> &lt;You more than most of these cucks<br><br><br><br>Yes.

I, for one, do remember that, among other things. A lot of nice things died out, sometimes as a result of faded hype, large change in userbase (college students moving on or jobs etc), or because of new rulings set by mods or posters of the board, even if it isn't fully agrred by man (recall what happened to periodical Aria threads). As always said, /a/ was never good and generally become worse as time passes. 4chan's growing popularity that aided an explosive influx of newfags, normalfags, and cross-boarders mixing in causes quality to decrease and that can't be stopped.</br>  <br>Seems like your taste is pure shit from where I'm standing.</br>  <br> from where I'm standing <br>Are you perhaps banging a coed while typing your posts?</br></br>  Come at me faggot.  <br> Be 27 and live in a house <br> Rarely ever leave the house <br>Uh, no?</br></br></br>  <br>She's low but not that low.<br>Kosaki &gt; Marika &gt; Yuinee</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> (She's close though)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Wrong<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Correct</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What.

I scrolled through pics to find anyone cute from an anime I didn't know, but you trying to tell people to get out of /a/ while in a thread that is literally shit, you can't be serious, this thread might as well be a fishing shack with all the bait everywhere, you should know better if you're going to tell people to get off /a/</br>  <br><br>Does no one remember golden era? Best times was when /a/ was super hyped for Nanoha. Those were fun, nice, and take it easy times for most of the board, and of course when Nanoha activity was at its peak at time and after the time of Nanoha A's. Current /a/ is in a low state for various reasons compared to those times. The Nanoha fanbase of today is barely a faction of what it was back then and this is reflected in Vivid threads of last season. The saying you're here forever is quite untrue as people do leave and in part of that, too many Nanoha bros have left for /m/, AS, NanoFate, and other boards. <br><br>Shit, it has been over a decade since Nanoha started. I feel old.</br></br></br></br>    <br>My bad, I forgot to quote  as well.</br>  <br>Literally the only thing I liked about that shit show.</br>  <br>Din do nuffin wrong</br>  <br> We enjoy anime and manga where we can relate to the characters, like Boku no Pico, Kodomo no Jikan, and Pretty Cure <br>There were sides here.

Someone forgot about Poe's law. For all your talk about shitposting, you never even considered that I may be shitposting.<br><br>But, yeah. I'm not.

It's amazing for how autistic they are, how much they talk behind people's backs brazenly like in any other culture. Glad that they got cut in those edges for once</br>  I wish WT had better art, the faces are so goddamn boring  <br>I hope so.<br><br>I live for those characters. They explain evrything.</br></br></br>  <br>How about someone dump the whole chapter???</br>  <br>It's chinese</br>  <br>You racist or somthing</br>  The anime got pretty good. I was just gonna leave it as dropped  <br>I don't know, I felt the same way you do, but the style has really grown on me. Feels just right for all the 'tacticool' stuff.</br>  <br>New sniper is blushing a lot around Chika.</br>  Fuck chika is going to be taken away by the short sniper  <br>i woud fuck chika</br>  <br>From what I understand, that's more or less how Japan felt about the manga. It was really low in the rankings but started to climb up as it went in to the invasion arc. Basically the same pattern as  Soul Society in Bleach. </br>  The new sniper shota is cute.  <br>Soul Society arc was 15 volumes the invasion was 4? maybe. I hope the maga get awesome arch like that soon</br>  <br><br>Taking a look at the raws it appears that he can read thoughts. No wonder he is cutting retards</br></br>  Why does /a/ hate world trigger  <br>Who wouldn't?</br>  <br>And why do you think /a/ hate it?</br>  <br>A bit overboard for letting talk shit about him.</br>  I guess I'll dump          <br>It's because no normal powerlevel shonen bullshit</br>              <br>He really has a crush on her</br>      <br>Was he even triggered at that moment?</br>      I really want someone to go full predator and use scorpion to make claws and shit. Looks like this guy might be it      <br>Tsukihiko Amō holds the second of earths black triggers.<br>I don't think he'll use a normal trigger.</br></br>    <br>Does he really?</br>  <br>It's this one page. His side effect is clearly reading minds. Makes you wonder about the kind of person that his leader is, to follow him being that jaded</br>  <br>Is that Amo though</br>  <br><br>You could already see it in the last chapter.</br></br>  <br>I can't tell.</br>  <br>How is this bad boy called? Kageura?</br>  <br><br><br>Is Amo a neightboor? His eyes look weird. Im more and more convinced everyday that he was the one who killed Yuma.</br></br></br>  <br>I couldn't!</br>  Tranlatorfag I summon you (I think I did the spell wrong)  <br>Yeah he is a neighbour just like tachikawa<br><br><br>WT threads don't have a TL Anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I like her with Yuuma, but at this point I am taking whoever is not Osamu since I want Kitora to go dere for him</br></br></br>  <br>Tachikawa is only a perpetual chuuni with fly eye-lenses</br>  <br>I think that he is the leader, the team is named after him</br>  <br>we need tl fag</br>  <br> fly eye-lenses <br>DELUSION<br><br>Sorry, but Kou will one day kick his dead beat neighbour ass</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought Tachikawa used contacts to make him see everywhere and use Kogetsu like a pro or something.</br>  <br>miwa get out of here</br>  <br>lenses like this were never mentioned in WT<br><br><br>It's filthy enough that Yuuma was accepted, at the least he is the son of someone relevant, Tachikawa and Amo need to be purged</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't see YuumaxChika happen ever. Yuuma is bound to go back to his world someday.</br></br>  <br>Chika can just follow him. + he dosent have a world.</br>  <br>I really don't see that as viable. Yuma was torn apart, Amo just seems to level everything indiscriminately. <br><br>Kikuchihara's comment about black triggers was funny since it implies that he thinks that Amo has a good personality, unlike Jin.</br></br></br>  <br>Amo does look like a good kid. God i hope he is not some edgy lord.</br>  <br>Im sure there are a lot of secondary triggers that arent mentioned yet. Tachikawa being Tachikawa could have one.<br><br><br>Which is strange considering everyone seems to describe Amo as a monster. He is obviously loyal to Kido at least, but i do consider he could be a neightbor.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He looks like a calm aspie.</br>  <br> He is obviously loyal to Kido <br> amou turns out to be Kido's kid who was turned into a neighbour throught Neighbours or human experiments <br>   His black trigger is his sibling who died during the same thing happening to him/her <br>Please no</br></br></br></br>  <br>His dad is dead so there is not really much point for him to go back. I think he would rather stay where his dad was born and his new friends are instead</br>  <br>Are you all forgeting that Yuuma is dying???</br>  <br><br>Are you implying he won't be saved?</br></br>  <br>Confirmed amo has a brother</br>  <br>OOOO boy he is sooo dead.. Ashihara will make him suffer like no other.</br>  Still missing Replica.  So we have captain pompous douchebag and captain edgelord next match. At least based Azuma will eventhings out  <br>Replica miss you 2</br>  <br>I'm guessing Murakami is the one on the bottom of the scorecard considering his side effect</br>  <br>Murakami is such a good guy... I hope we see more of him in da future.</br>  <br>In Ninomiya defense, he is not pompous. Just a douchebag.</br>  Reminder no new chapter next week  <br>I hope it's osamu, and plus even if it's not her I hope it's anyone else besides Kitora because I hate tsundere types. they are always the most annoying and usually the worst girl of the series. Hopfully nasu comes in if it isn't chika</br>  <br>Noooooo kill me now</br>  <br><br> Having shit taste this bad <br><br>Kitora is not a bad tsundere since she is not violent</br></br></br></br>  <br> liking a over arrogant attention seeking whore <br>  implying there is such a thing as a good tsundere </br></br>  <br>Pretty good streak considering Ashihara's condition.</br>  <br>Kitora isn't a Tsundere. She openly likes Karasuma and considers Osamu more of a rival.</br>  <br> she isn't tsundere (yet) but if she starts to like osamu she will turn into one. And just because she's nice to other people doesn't mean she isn't tsundere.</br>  <br>Ashihara is dead like your dreams</br>  <br> Hopfully nasu comes in if it isn't chika <br>Pixiv has you covered.</br></br>  <br>Thanks anon and pixiv</br>  <br>Nasu is roo cute for osamu.</br>  <br>Kikuchihara is the one who fills that category then. Kitora is more neutral around most people she isn't nice to.</br>  OK WHO WILL POST SOME HENTAI???????????????????????????? I NEED KIRIE TITS SO MUCH RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  <br> ?????????????????!!!!!!!!!! <br>Don't shout and stop that.</br></br>  <br>But he will never be dere, he isn't really cold or hostile to anybody he's just blunt about what he thinks. While Kitora is openly hostile and cold to osamu while she treats everyone else nice or with respect</br>  <br>WONT STOP AND CANT STOP!<br>ANALLLLLLLLLL TIIIMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!<wbr>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</wbr></br></br>  <br>Has she ever been hostile outside of the beginning where she thought Osamu was a rising genius? She acts pretty civil around him now.</br>  <br>Is it weird that I can't visualise Nasu without Kumagai? Basically if you're gonna ship Osamu with Nasu you gotta include Kumagai ... and Kitora .<br><br>Quick, someone post pics of Nasu and Kumagai together ... please?</br></br></br>  <br>What she still talks shit about him and gets mad when he's praised and she's not, wasn't she even smiling when someone criticized him. Just because she isn't hitting him doesn't mean she isn't hostile, she never greets him with a smile and just like in last chapter when ashi complimented on him his knowledge she was thinking how she was the one who taught him. She always have negative thoughts for osamu</br>  <br>No both of those are terrible ships it's either <br>Osamuxchika <br>Or<br>Osamuxnasu <br>If neither of those pair win then they all should stay forever alone</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That must be a violation of Border's rules of using a trigger outside a training room.</br>  <br>replica might wind up on their team/squad emblem when they make it to A-class.</br>  <br>That would be great</br>  <br> wasn't she even smiling when someone criticized him <br>To be fair it was Karasuma repeating him what she told him about Osamu's performance. She's an egotist</br></br>  Got some translations. <br><br>Sniper training room:<br>  Touma tells Narasaka to try sniping with a cat on the head. It is a refreshing experience. Narasaka refuses. <br> Akane is amazed on Yuzuru's skill and realizes that that's why he was consistently a bad performer in practices. Izuho is impressed too. He blushes when Chika praises him. <br>  Touma teases Yuzuru for being popular with girls. Yuzuru looks pissed off. <br> Touma introduces Yuzuru to the girls. They are surprised that he's 14 too. They thought that he's younger. The girls introduce themselves. Akane tells him that Chika is nicknamed Tamakoma's cannon. <br>  Yuzuru knows nothing about that, as he doesn't watch recordings. <br> Izuho asks if Touma is his mentor. Touma says yes, Yuzuru says no. It appears that Touma single handedly took Yuzuru as his disciple. But to Yuzuru, Hatohara is his one and only mentor. Touma is dejected. <br>  Narasaka is returning (home probably) and Akane has team meeting. <br> Touma teaches Izuho. She has tendency to veer to the left and Touma corrects that. <br> Chika asks Yuzuru about Hatohara. He says that Hatohara quit Border after being released off the expedition team. She joined Border for that purpose and even passed the selection test. But the higher ups removed her team afterwards because she never hit people. She was an excellent sniper who brought victories by sniping weapons instead. Her solo points were much lower than Touma's and Narasaka's but to Yuzuru, she was the best sniper. <br> Chika tells him that she cannot hit people too because she's afraid. Yuzuru says that it's not something you admit to your next opponent. Oops! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   world trigger chapter spoiler thread <br> 100+ posts <br>what the fuck they normally die around 40 posts</br></br>  Rest of the TLs<br><br>Solo battle room<br> Yuuma loses 6-9 to Murakami. <br> He asks Murakami if Kageura is the 3rd attacker. No, he's around 20th. Murakami has more loses than victories against Tachikawa, Kazama, Kageura, and Konami (though he rarely manages to duel Konami). Jin was already S-rank when he joined, so he has never fought against Jin. <br> Kageura team has Attacker - Gunner/shooter - Sniper makeup too. It was A-6 once and along with Ninomiya's team, they are the undisputed top-2 among B ranks. <br> Yuuma asks how strong Kageura is. Murakami says that Yuuma'll know once he meets Kageura. <br><br>Solo battle common area<br> Kageura Masato, B-2 team captain, Attacker, 18 years old.  <br> 2 C-ranks are gossiping behind his back. Kageura lost 8000 points and his team got demoted due to violence. They are saying how stupid he is. <br> Murakami and Yuuma have just entered the area. <br> Kageura asks what they want. They says that they are only joking and that they are his fan. (they are surprised about his good hearing in their thought bubbles)  <br> He tells them to leave, it's too much trouble. <br> The two C-ranks continue to gossip with trion bodies wireless communication (I think), that Kageura is surprisingly more composed than expected and that must be because of his punishment making him a coward. The last word ticks Kageura off. He decapitates the 2. <br> The 2 C-ranks complain that fights outside mock battles are not allowed. Kageura says that they just tripped and fell on their own. It's not that they saw him attack them. <br>  Yuuma notices scorpion. It was really fast but more importantly, how could scorpion cover such distance?  <br>  Murakami tells Yuuma not to stare at Kageura too much, else he'll snap at Yuuma. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Uy, poor Chika, now the top B Class team know that she cant shoot people, also explains why Ninomiya knew since the begining</br>  <br>It also explains why Ninomiya dislikes people who don't fight properly</br>  <br>I wonder what would happen if she shoots someone directly. Would it be a instant kill?<br><br>Also even if he has a small crush on her I doubt Yuzuru will go easy on her during a battle and will most likely use this to his advantage</br></br></br>  <br>Ok yeah you're right on that but still, once they start to interact more we will see her denying shit while blushing I can already see it coming. She has all the making for a tsundere its hinted even more when she sees how honest osamu is.</br>  <br><br>thanks.</br></br>  Kaguera must be unpredictable if Murakami loses to him more than average  <br>According to this it seems Edgelords side effect might not be mind reading, but the ability to listen in on trion communications. A lot less OP, yet still a very useful power.</br>  <br>Osamu is doomed then, if he can hear all his orders and plans the only good point of Osamu turns useless</br>  <br>It probably dosent have a large range</br>  <br>He used his bear hands, no trigger involved.</br>  <br>If you look at the trajectory it seems that whatever he is using bends. It looks like he is shooting something, but I am not sure. This will probably be important to the combat</br>  <br>The translation said he used a scorpion.</br>  <br>Scorpion can bend but normally the range isn't that long. I wonder what he is doing to give it extra range.</br>  <br>Cant Scorpion become pretty much anything you wish as long as you have enough trion to support it? It was said Chika could have used it as an armor -through a very innefective armor at that-</br>  <br>Perhaps he got the option that extends the kogetsu to work with the scorpion?<br><br><br>As I recall, the scorpion's supposed to be fairly brittle, and suck at defending. That's the trade off for it's blades anywhere ability.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What if has multiple scorpion that spawn off each other into a super long blade?</br>  <br>That could work. It kinda depends on whether or not you can spawn a scorpion blade off of a scorpion instead of the body though.</br>  <br>The body is made of trion and the blade is made of trion. It could possible work</br>  <br>Thanks OP, I love you man.</br>  <br>Is that the autistic S-ranked guy?</br>  saving the thread!<br><br>Just reached the conclusion of the Viza fight in the anime. I still love how immediately after dealing the finishing blow, Yuuma fucks off. It's so appropriate. No banter, no commentary, just "okay, that's done, gotta go!"<br><br>Yuuma's a great character.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Also as an aside, I noticed Ashihara was snuck into the series.</br>  <br>That is the captain of the B Rank number 2 squad</br>  <br>No, the S-ranked guy is Tsukihiko Amō. Like  says, that's Masato Kageura.</br>  <br>If he was able to listen in on the C-Rank's wireless, he might have some sort of side effect that enhances his trion manipulation.</br>  <br>If his side effect is known though, Osamu can mix some lies into the communication to confuse the enemy or talk shit to make him angry so they can throw him off balance.</br>  <br>You niggas laughed at me earlier when I said that wasn't Amo fuck you guys</br>  did i miss the part where hiura's family decided to stay in town? I thought her family was moving after the match?  <br>Her family is moving in the near future, but exactly when was not specified. So this will be her last rank wars, and she might have to leave before the final match of them, but that match with Osamu's team was not her last match. That's why they were like "let's see how far we can get" while preparing for the match. <br><br>Basically, come mid-late April, and she'll be living elsewhere, and be that transfer student that transfers in just a couple weeks after the school year starts. Until then, she gets to stay in Border.</br></br></br>  <br> Rank 1 sniper training some scrub C-rank <br><br>Why?</br></br></br>  <br>Why not? That how it works in Border.<br>Also Izuho is cute and he liked the cat.</br></br>  <br>[TRIGGER WARNING]</br>  <br>Because Border are good people in general, even if they wanted to kill Yuuma just for being a Neighbor, also there is that senpai(kouhai thing, must be cool see your own pupil becoming strong</br>  <br>Because not everyone at Border is a pompous arrogant edgelord who doesn't care about weaker people.</br>  <br>I guess you could say that he<br>( •_•)<br>( •_•)&gt;⌐■-■<br>(⌐■_■)<br>got triggered</br></br></br></br></br>  World Trigger will be getting english dub...... i hope it air on tv  Airing in 5 hours. <br><br>Story :<br>The story takes place at a certain middle school where several murder cases take place.

Kobayashi takes an interest in Akechi and, in spite of his friend Hashiba's worries, he volunteers to be Akechi's assistant.<br><br>Also, reminder that the cute ass is a  trap </br></br></br></br></br>   &gt;trap <br><br>My interest has peaked.</br></br>  Doesn't look like it'll be great, but I can't resist that cute trap butt.  <br> trap <br>I'd care if it were a reverse trap, but still watching for mystery.</br></br>  <br> FUNIMASHIT </br>  I wanna tap Kobayashi  I really want this to be good, guys.  The writer and director have done some good stuff. This looks like a different style though.  <br> mfw most new titles on Thursday are picked up by Funi </br>  When will noitaminA try to throw something new about Cabaneli? Gonna ask this in every noitamina threads until WIT will finally reveal something!  <br> generic shit <br> generic shit <br> suddenly trap <br>ok sold.</br></br></br></br>  Will we get Kobayashi shower scenes?  <br>Hopefully we need this so we can confirm this by judging his overall torso and hips.</br>  Damn, Noitama has become shit already  <br>See <br><br>Cabaneli needs to save noitaminA immediately.</br></br></br>  There's no way this isn't gay, right?  <br>Just like Guilty Crown save anime huh ?</br>  <br>Not really. Araki has explicitly said sometime before that he needs to redeem himself with his next original work. Not only that, I seriously hope WIT Studio will redeem itself too after working on 3 years of low quality televised stories.</br>  <br>Dark horse of the season. It can be a masterpiece, or horrible shit.<br><br>Hope for first, but believe rather in second. The last serious detective story (not counting Hyouka, Kamisama Memochou) was Un Go and Supernatural Tantei Yakumo. This one reminds the last, will see how it goes.</br></br></br>  <br>But, will he redeem himself ?<br><br>I thought he already busy with SnK season 2 for 2016. And if Cabaneli delayed til next year, then it has high chance to be fail again.<br><br>But yeah, I hope he will delivers something good, at least like what he used to be in madhouse.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, I hear somewhere in 2ch that Cabaneli is scheduled for next winter when it was first announced alongside Game of Laplace and Subete ga F ni Naru (November 27 to be precise).</br>  Glasses is in love with trap, trap is in love with genius and genius is in love with the thrill of the chase.  <br>So its Phi Brain?</br>  <br>He is straight.<br><br>Kogoro Akechi is a tall, handsome man with heavy eyebrows who dresses well. He is married to a woman named Fumiyo (文代) and lives with Yoshio Kobayashi, the leader of the Boy Detectives Club. Kobayashi often plays an important part in solving cases. Like his mentor, he is an expert at disguise and is especially adept at posing as a young woman. Aside from these relationships little is known of the detective's personal life, which always takes a back seat to the mystery in his adventures.</br></br></br>  <br>pupa 2.0</br>  <br>All of that fits with my hypothesis.</br>  Now that i checked PV, it looks like shit. Too bad.<br><br>Wished a quality mystery..<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=iLc<wbr>64phEhgI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>If only we could get another one as good as that.</br>  <br><br>Watch Hyouka if you have not.</br></br>  <br>Of course i have. Hyouka however is hardly a proper mystery in that sense. I still watch Conan and watched Kindaichi when it aired - those were the only classic detectives of recently.<br><br>Terror in Resonance had some mystery going, but turned out to be shallow. Hopefully Pluto will get anime eventually by Mappa.</br></br></br>  Episode 1 starting in 5 minutes.  <br>I guess no one watching this?</br>  <br>I'll be watching, not sure what to expect honestly.</br>  get in here niggas   Butterfly symbolism <br>I guess Seiji Kishi worked too much on Persona.</br>  who homos here?  <br>I'll be watching, with subs.</br>  I came now, what did I miss? This is original right?  <br> Comparing Hyouka to Mouryou no Hako <br><br>I liked both but you are deluded if you think hyouka is a mystery, much less a good one.</br></br></br>  <br>Any other group doing this aside Funi?</br>  <br>I got to say, disfigured corpse aesthetic is such cliche for mystery its shame to use it with rare exceptions.<br><br>I`d rather have genius antagonist than psychotic. There are so many ways to be just as cruel, but more stylish and creative.</br></br></br>  <br>This was so great.

We can't count on HS, right?  <br>Funi picked this up but they haven't said when the simulcast is actually going to start.</br>  <br>What about a maniacal gentleman murderer?</br>  <br>Are you stupid enough to think this is a novel adaption?</br>  <br>Its not direct novel adaptation, but is based on quit known japanese mystery novel.<br><br>Like Sherlock TV or Elementary are based on Sherlock Holmes original stories.</br></br></br>  OP: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>wcud9<br>ED: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>wcv0x</wbr></br></wbr>  <br>Detective Conan`s "Kogoro Mori" is based on character of this novels series Author. Conans "kids detective club" as well.<br><br>So yeah, its right in the name says "Ranpo" aka writers name. Characters are all based on his novels too, including the trap.</br></br></br>  <br>Loose adaptations don't reflect the quality of the original work.</br>  <br>OP is not the best, but like live action parts. Would be nice if anime had them too.</br>  <br> Edogawa Ranpo is authors name <br> Edogawa Conan <br> Kogoro - Kogoro Mori <br> Ran <br> detective club <br>etc.<br><br>Reminds me i have 4 episodes of Detective Conan to watch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127485487 <br>How the hell did you figure that out?<br><br>Its straight Sherlock Holmes style (since author was fan faggot that copied him exactly) detective story.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127485487 <br>Eh</br>  <br>butthurt laplacefag is butthurt face it its shit</br>  <br>Very strange imagery in both.</br>  <br>I dont expect it to be good, i dont thinkt here even are any laplace-fags yet, i`ll wait to see if they actually manage to make it interesting (meanwhile Conan is in interesting ark atm and is better Ranpo inspired work anyway).<br><br>However calling it Glaslip is like calling God Eater Non Non Biyori</br></br></br>  Looks like episode 1 is out at Funi site.<br>http://www.funimation.com/shows/ram<wbr>po-kitan/videos/official/the-human-<wbr>chair-part-1</wbr></wbr></br>  I thought of giving this a chance but shit, this must be the gayest season I've ever experience after the one where Free started airing. First off we get a show that's blatant yaoi, another one that was yaoi at first, like I mean YAOI MAD YAOI, but people complained and the MC is now a reverse trap, and now this shit? <br><br>Is japan trying to shut up the faggots and fujoshits? I think I'll be watching 5 shows max this season.</br></br>  <br>Thank you based Funi</br>  <br> 127486235 <br>shit wrong thread and can't delete this shit.</br></br>  <br>The kid is not trap nor gay. He is kid of famouse detective Akechi Kogoro, running a detective boys similarly how street kids worked for Sherlock Holmes.<br><br>He is master in disguise and specifically as woman too.</br></br></br>  <br>Where did you mean to post it?</br>  <br>Sounds like Aoharu.</br>  <br>I was talking about another anime that is being released today. The extremely gay manga that got changed due to it being too gay was Aoharu x Kikanjuu. MC was a boy at first now it's gender bender were the female MC dresses as a men.</br>  I can't fap to dat ass unless it's 100% sure it's a boy.  I got to say i like the MC. Absolutely calm in face of murder and thrill. Reminds of AssClass trap.<br><br>This might actually be interesting.<br><br>Plus its interesting how they shuffled the characters from original.<br><br>The edgy guys swallowing pills is Akechi Kogoro, aka main character of Edogawa Ranpo`s novel (aka Kogoro Mori).<br><br>The MC is who supposed to be his son. etc.<br><br>Like the atmosphere and music too. Did not expect much from this, but looks like might actually end up this seasons favorite.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Er, what? Aoharu x Kikanjuu MC always was reverse trap girl and 2 boys. And the manga is not actually gay and i expect will be liked by /a/ since actually have Subagemu and brofisting.</br>  <br>Oh wait, you judge an entire medium based on its adaptation? Can you be more retarded than this, huh?</br>  <br> He is kid of famouse detective Akechi Kogoro, running a detective boys similarly <br><br>Sounds homoerotic</br></br></br>  Its fun seeing all Detective Conan characters here (well, the opposite Conan has Ranpo`s characters).<br><br>i.e Personas "bitches and whores" inspector is actually Nakamura, Nakamura (中村 Nakamura?) is a detective from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. He appears first in Metropolitan Police Detective Love Story.</br></br>  <br>The only erotic you`ll find in this show is eroguro.</br>  <br>Oh, it's a disguise? Huh.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>    <br>So she's legit girl right? Picked back the fuck up.</br>  <br>No, he`s a boy. See actress tha played him in a movie.<br><br>Depending on adaptation, he is depicted from almost girly looking boy, gay boy, or just a normal brat (DS game).</br></br></br>    <br>HS release when?</br>  MC of the season. Happy because sensei died and finally something broke him out of boredom.<br><br>Total sociopath.<br><br>Thats kind of TANOSHI! i like.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if Seiji has a thing for traps.</br>  Ok officially one of my favorite this season, also production values are crap.  MC arrested at end of Ep. <br><br>In before he actually IS a murderer, since he`s a ruthless sociopath psycho anyway. Cant be cannonically, since based on known character - but would be fun if they fooled the viewer in anime and did that contrary to all expectations.</br></br>  Subs soon?  <br> Subs soon? <br>It's out at Funi, not sure why HS or other Funi rippers still haven't released it though.</br></br>  <br> The only erotic you`ll find in this show is eroguro. <br><br>If they showed the process of those girls getting plasticized, then I'll take it</br></br></br>  There better be scenes of Kobayashi dressing as a girl and kissing  boys   <br>I have the highest hopes for this. If only subs were released, so I could finally watch it.</br>  <br>Dont. Its not masterpiece - its cheap, slow and meh direted. Its only appeal is that it actually IS a proper mystery show which is rather rare today, sociopath trap MC, music and the fact its only story of worth at all this season. So to enjoy it has to watch it as reading a book - disregard all the cheap stuff they should have done times better if it was proper studio with talent and budget.<br><br>Its kinda like Shiki without vampires.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm a sucker for mystery, that's why I'm so hyped.</br>  <br> tfw a post advising not to get your hopes up raises your hopes </br>  <br>He's a sociopath?<br><br>Interesting. Picked up.</br></br></br>  <br>He litterally cums when thinking about disfigured bodies, peril and murder.<br><br>Litteral quote from anime:<br>- But you witnessed gruesome death of teacher and you can be next!<br>- TANOSHI!!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As far his psychologic profile goes, hard to tell if he is sociopath, psyhopath or anything else. At any rate he`s not normal.<br><br>He does not feel fear, disgust or seems like any normal emotions. Show starts with him waking up holding a murder weapon and seeing disfigured body of teacher... and smiling.<br><br>Seems his social behavioris fake, pointing sociopath traits. However the fact he gets excited, litterally getting high/erect, when dealing with death/thrill of danger points more on psychopathic traits - since sociopath shoudnt be that emotional.<br><br>At any rate, sick person, bored to death and Death and Murder being excitement in his life. <br><br>Lucky he ended up one of detectives, since with such character just as well could be a murderer  who knows, maybe that`ll be actual twist, though hes a book character so shoudnt be </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So what does this have to do with Laplace?</br>  Whats given is that we`ll see MC crossdress, since just like Akechi (his mentor, and pill swallowing detective here) he is master of disguise and specifically as young women. So it sure to appear in plot.<br><br>Also in novels HE is the leader of Detective Boys, while in anime he just mets Akechi in first episode.<br><br>The main villain likely to be https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_F<wbr>iend_with_Twenty_Faces<br><br>Trivia:<br>In detective Conan, most of his traits are given to Conan himself, while Kogoro Mori = Akechi Kogoro. But Kobayashi is also present as elementary tomboy school teacher, displaying his androgenous role again</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>   Those hips <br><br>There's no way this is a boy. This has to be a reverse trap</br></br>  Subs never. What the hell is going on with HS today? I feel like at least 4 different shows should have been released.  <br>He's a master of disguise.</br>  <br>No idea, they have one fucking job and they can't do it properly.</br>  <br>He shoudnt be yet. He just met Akechi for the first time. Akechi is the one who teaches him detective stuff including disguise. <br><br>Then again, its loosely based on novel setting, so they`ll find reason for him to crossdress. Probably being a bait for murderer.</br></br></br>  This was fucking awful, jesus christ  The silhouettes sound nice on paper, but the execution is awful and they don't even do it consistently. <br><br>But I enjoyed it, it's interesting and the BGM is good.</br></br>  Trivia:<br>Kobayashi first appered not in Akachi Kogoro novels, but in Ranpos novel "Vampire" which focused on  male male desire. </br>   [AU] Rampo Kitan Game of Laplace - 01 [720p].mkv <br><br>ITS HERE</br></br>  I hope Gakkou Gurashi is the high budget Lerche show of the season.    <br>Lets just hope Kirara is willing to shell out for it.</br>  <br>Well, instead of homosexual as in novels, they made him gurosexual in anime</br>  <br>Is that a funi rip?</br>  So the biggest mystery of the series is Kobayashi's gender, amirite?  I wonder what significance do all characters having Masks in the OP has. Just symbolic, that all they hide something dark, or will they actually wear them at some point (quite possible seeing the bizzare murders cases).  <br>Yes, it is.</br>  <br>He is male. Also that does not stop japanese from fapping to him </br>    heh, it seems MC actually is a psychopath - he hallutinates. The orchids visuals, is how he sees death and blood.<br><br>Note the scene as it appears, and then as "he sees it" i.e. orchids blooming around.<br><br>So the versions that follow are:<br>1) he is crazy<br>2) he is crazy and is a murderer<br>3) aftereffect of whatever drug he was drugged with<br><br>But seems butterflies/orchids are things he sees for real.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Unreliable narrators are great.</br>  Its obviously he is not the murderer, since his clothes are not bloodstained (unlike half the classroom) and he unlikely had physical strength to do that.<br><br>He is still crazy though.</br></br>  Seems we have an AOTS already  Not sure what suicidal teacher has to do with that, but we`ll see that later.  <br>H-how bad is it?</br>  <br>Pfft, viewers attention span is 0. If you read this thread, you should be able to figure out who this is.<br><br> its crossdressing Akechi </br></br></br>  <br>based Zoom Player</br>   tanoshii    The Human Chair <br>Fuck, I hate that story.</br>  <br>What the fuck is with those scars, gross</br>  I like it. It's not as bad as I thought it would be, and the mystery seem pretty decent.  <br> doesn't know murakami. <br> is shit. </br></br>  <br>What are you trying to say with this post</br>  <br>I read Superfrog Saves Tokyo.<br>It was okay.</br></br>  <br>Please tell me this is a girl, this sausage fest needs one at least</br>  <br>Its crossdressing this guy,</br>  <br>A fucking master of disguise</br>  <br>At first I thought that was bullshit, but it turns out they have the exact same eye color, so I guess it must be true.<br>He's on hell of an actor though.</br></br>  <br>Why? It is awesome. Also not really related to current ark other thank Chairmaker and Akechi having sofa "from previous owner" at his house</br>  <br>How the fuck did he change his eyeshape</br>  <br>The original character is based on Sherlock Holmes, so all his disguse antics are prominent with him.<br><br>Kobayashi learns that from him as well.</br></br></br>  Is this based on a book or something   super genius <br> corporate heir <br> harem master <br>What the fuck is with this cast of special snowflakes?</br></br></br>  Damn, she is cute.  <br>Better than<br><br> Im just a normal student until a girl fell from the sky </br></br></br>  <br>I don't see a she in the picture.</br>  The culprit is the friend, right?  <br>Nice.</br>  <br>Who is the harem master</br>  <br>This is based on whole sum of novels written by Edogawa Rampo (Detective conan bases its characters on it as well. i.e. Akechi Kogoro = Kogoro Mori etc.). There are many of them, and this show only loosely uses their themes (as Human chairs in this ark) and characters.<br><br>Theres many references, but just as Sherlock TV or Elementary tv show are different from original Conan Doyles stuff, so this is. The cases itself are new too.</br></br></br>   Having people killed around me is TANOSHII <br>I want to buttfuck this trap so hard, he's adorable.</br>  Why y'all watching this homo shit?  <br>How does rampo compares to doyle or other detective authors</br>  <br>Because it's interesting</br>  <br>Look closer anon.</br>   2 days into the season <br> MC of the season already confirmed </br>  <br>You probably should have spoilered that.<br><br> Because the twist is cheap. <br><br>The whole concept of human chair is already pretty stupid, so it's a huge leap of faith to go with it. But nope, it wasn't true all along, you gullible readers! <br><br>That is literally asking for your good will only to betray you at the end. Fuck that.</br></br></br></br> <br>I realize that this is an unpopular opinion though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He is Conan Doyle fag, i.e. Akechi Kogoro is his pretty much copy paste of Sherlock.<br><br>That said, he written quite a few famous novels and stands very well on its own. And for Japan he cant be overestimated - he is THE mystery writer.<br><br>Also his favorite writer is Edgar Allan Poe, Ranpo stands for how his name is written in Japanese.</br></br></br></br></br>  all murderers like the TANOSHII  <br>MC</br>  Jesus Christ what a waste of time and money  <br>Because all of /a/ is his harem?</br>  This anime has great amounts of FUN  Wow the writing is terrible. Couldn't even finish the episode.  <br>Yeah, not everyone can handle it when anime demands from you to actually think</br>  <br>His non-detective stuff is more interesting.</br>  <br>Guess you dropped everything else that aired this season that, because this is the best one so far.</br>  <br><br>Into the backlog it goes<br>How much of his work is translated?</br></br></br>  <br>That was said half in jest, but his girly looks probably will attract a good number of male characters.</br>  Can a boy (terms and conditions apply) also have TANOSHII?  <br>Right about now, his class honestly things he`s a creepy sociopath who dismembered their teacher and who knows else</br>  <br>Same, dropped it half way. The shit OP with stock footage and the character silhouettes didn't help. Also sausagefest and traps.</br>  Oh damn, this is actually interesting.  <br>you missed the fate thread</br>   MC was suicidal <br> Detective was suicidal in the past (or was that his old friend?) <br> Teacher either is or was suicidal/self-harming <br><br>What's with this theme</br></br></br></br>   draw a girl <br> with a very sweet girl voice <br> with a male protecting her <br> more cute than other girls <br> call it a boy <br><br>This is so wrong, but I like it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edoga<wbr>wa_Ranpo</wbr> </br>  <br>What other girls?</br>  <br> Nothing but cliché characters <br> Fucking 17 years old dude skipping school to help police. And he's chuuni as fuck <br> A trap <br> "Look I'm so kawaii!" teacher <br> The police can't even stop teenagers from entering a crime scene <br> MC is so special that he didn't give a fuck when he saw a corpse <br> "Yeah I don't think that a studend can kill his teacher" <br><br>It's just too much. That anime takes itself too seriously. I can't keep my suspension of disbelief. I think I'm literally too old for this shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Inko is that you?</br>  MC does thing to my dick and I don't even like mystery stuff  One version would be:<br>1) Akechi found the "chairman", proven his guilt, and killed him/placed his body in classroom - police had to play along since he has "special rights" as Imperial investigator as he said and which seems to be true.<br>2) He drugged Kobayashi and placed evidence against him in house of teacher (case he solved himself), since he knew about Kobayashi`s talents/observed him before - and now decided to test him if he`s worthy to be his pupil.<br><br>I.e. its all a game. Teacher was indeed murderer, but murder in classroom did not happen and Kobayashi is with purpose falsely accused to see if he`ll find a way out. <br><br>Pretty sure end of ark will be him pointing at Akechi and telling something like "Anon, but YOU were a murderer all along!"</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So it's trash?  <br>That's literally how it goes with every harem character.<br> seemingly everybody hates them <br> except the ones who talk to them more than 5 minutes and fall for them right away <br>How else are you supposed to self-insert?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You missed Lerche's previous anime</br>  Makes me want to rewatch Un-go.  <br>MC wasnt suicidal (MC is Kobayashi aka trap). He is suicidal i.e. disregards danger as longs its Tanoshi.<br>Detective (you mean Akechi?) is dieing - thus the meds, the song on music machine (read the title) and flashbacks.<br>Teacher(female) is not suicidal - its detective (see above) crossdressed as female teacher to approach Kobayashi and observe him</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much this<br><br>I'll give it 3 episodes though</br></br></br>  <br>I was thinking on that as well, but are you saying that as fact or speculation? I thought this was an original series that drew inspiration from novels, not an adaptation of sorts.</br>  <br>Those all seem to be pretty superficial reasons to dislike a show.</br>  <br>Please explain this to me:<br> A trap is a boy, who looks like a girl. <br>Shouldn't a reverse trap be a girl who looks like a boy? In which case the girl would be ugly as sin; and that's what you want?<br>Although every "reverse trap" I've seen represented in shows is just a cute girl who wears trousers and says "boku".</br></br></br></br>  My bet is on the vice-/superintendent to be the guilty guy. StuCo prez is the butler here, he can't have done it because it is to be expected of him to have done it.  <br>Yep</br>  <br>The grey silhouette classmates said that.</br>  <br>Speculation of course, but this being proper mystery, its full of hints. Does not mean we interpret them correctly yet - but they are there.<br><br>Female Teacher being Akechi fits the profile of detective who is prominent as master of disguise (also we arent told that in anime yet, its common knowledge of that character from novels, which all japanese know), hand cuts, hair being obviously parique and actual hair being dark (which can be seen), teacher - while having identity and relevant for plot not being here  , meaning its not actual character</br></br></br>  <br>It's tanoshii.</br>  <br>Hating the characters and a badly written plot seem to be good reasons to dislike an anime.</br>  <br> trap being used as a negative <br> literally being used wrong <br>Thank god you dropped it.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah if you have low standards</br>  <br>OP and ED contradict it. In fact, this adaptation seems to be more focused on MC and his relationship, rather than Akechi and MCs as in original novels.<br><br>I.e in OP vice- is the one facing MC in classrom where all disappear. In ED he is the one catching the "falling MC" from death like all other figures in ED. <br><br>If he were the murderer, he`d be not relevant beyound this ark (unless he is "the man of 20 faces", which i doubt).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> In which case the girl would be ugly as sin <br>Are you retarded?</br></br>  I'm glad saki stopped pretending to be a girl  <br>There's nothing wrong with those reasons though.</br>  <br>show me how high your standards are, anon</br>  <br>I would call a girl who looks like a boy ugly. You wouldn't?</br>  <br><br> murder mystery <br> trap <br><br>MY MIND IS TELLING ME YES<br><br>BUT MY BODY<br><br>MY BODY</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This fucking guy  <br>very</br>  <br>I would call a girl who looks like a cute boy cute. You wouldn't?</br>  <br>You don't really hate the characters themselves, or the plot itself, you mostly dislike superficial details about them.<br>Also it's too soon to tell if the plot is well written or not.<br><br>If you're gonna use those reasons then you didn't even need to watch the first ep, the trailers would have been enough to convince you to not watch the show.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No. I wouldn't. I'd call her ugly. I might like her if i was gay though.</br>  <br> Nothing but cliché characters <br>Those character can only be cliche for jap mystery anime since all jap mystery anime cliches in Conan, Kindaichi, etc. are based on THOSE characters and novels in first place. They sure as hell arent cliche for normal anime.<br> Fucking 17 years old dude skipping school to help police. And he's chuuni as fuck <br>Do you even Meitantei? Plus original setting was 30th years of 20th century, in anime switched to modern. Some rudiments of its left, like him being "imperial" detective, which is kinda strange unless japan won WW2 in this timeline<br> A trap <br>He is not. He is however canonically androgene and novels count as one of first example of homo fiction in Japan.  albeit likely not in anime, here he is just a psycho<br> "Look I'm so kawaii!" teacher <br>Disguised detective. Do you even Sherlock Holmes?<br> The police can't even stop teenagers from entering a crime scene <br>Do you even Detective Conan or any other young mystery fiction? Plus they try to stop the vice. Akechi comes since he has FBi/Men in Black credentials<br> "Yeah I don't think that a studend can kill his teacher" <br>Actually relevant, since this originally set in 30th years of XX, was period of students rebellion in Japan, violence etc.<br><br>Itt. you are just shallow ADHD fag. Probably amerifat and thinks Hyouka is Sol</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It seems playing mahjong wasn't fun enough  <br>Anon, you're already gay, and you have shit taste to boot.</br>  <br><br>And Psycho Pass was Kara no Shoujo 2.0, or something like it.</br></br>  <br>I don't watch trailers. And it's difficult to like those characters when those superficial details are all they are.</br>  <br>And Kara no Shoujo was Mouryou no Hako 2.0</br>   watching funishit  <br>Kill yourselves.</br>  <br>So everything in this anime is just rehashed shit from other works? One more reason to drop it.</br>  <br><br>I read KnS before I watched that, but you're right<br><br>right down to the head in a box</br></br></br></br>  <br>But those aren't all they are.<br>We have the detective, the assitant and the clueless guy.<br>Their classic detective fiction roles are more important than their age or if they look really cute for a boy.</br></br></br>  <br>Spoiler<br> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_H<wbr>uman_Chair<br>http://kissmanga.com/Manga/Human-Ch<wbr>air/Ch-000---Oneshot-?id=178592</wbr></br></wbr> </br></br>  <br> watching subs <br>kill yourself</br></br>  <br> watching <br>retard</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127496821 <br>Are you retarded?</br>  Did they ruin Edogawa Ranpo's stories with generic anime tropes?  <br> not watching it raw <br>kill yourself</br></br>  <br>CRAWWWWWWWLING IN MY SKIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN</br>  <br><br>The MC is a trap, what do you think.</br></br>  <br>but murakami is overrated and shit.</br>  <br>I don't understan the problem of some anons, it was a pretty nice set up for the series. <br><br>I didn't read any of the author original works, so i don't know how his mysteries usually plays out. still, the most logical solution would be mc fag friend, but it would be a nice touch if the killer was actually ''kobayashi'' playing a number on people expecting a faithful adaptation</br></br></br>  <br> trap <br>What a fucking waste, not a single episode watched and it a good contender for the worst of the season.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I'm sleepy and I thought it says "fujoshit"</br>  <br>Don't you know that these days anime watchers need constant stimulation by retarded waifu war or constant plot twists?</br>  <br>So this turned out to be 100% accurate.</br>  <br>Picked up for boy butt, hope it doesn't disappoint.</br>  <br>I know it's basically sherlock cocaine all over again, but when Akechi pulled out his drugs I tought 'here we go again with the Vicodin''</br>  <br>HOUSE?</br>  <br>But thats actully faithfull to how Edogawa wrote him...</br>  Are Rambo novels translated?

Only 5 minutes in and so much edge.    <br>The word is piqued, not peaked.</br>  <br>His interest could have already been present making peaked correct, I believe.</br>  <br> when anime demands from you to actually think <br>I'm not sure if you're taking a dig at anon's intelligence or if you actually believe that a show this shallow required any thinking from the viewer whatsoever.</br></br>  <br>thanks for correcting anon. people like you are a diamond dozen.</br>   Boy <br>Why do they do this?</br>  <br> Age 13 <br><br>That's how I like them</br></br></br>  <br>Cheeks like apples, anon.</br>  Why are people trying so hard to hate this show? Is it because of all the homo?  <br>I don't get it. He looks like a boy. It's like people claiming AssClass's MC looks like a girl when he really doesn't.</br>  <br>Because you can't take it seriously when the students are treating this murder mystery as a joke. It makes the entire setting fucking stupid.</br>  <br>They're both obviously kind of deranged, and whoever is going to take this seriously has only himself to blame</br>  I like the OP and ED.  <br><br>Well this should be perfect with a teacher that has cat ears. Even if she is in disguise, that is still stupid bullshit. I don't need plot twist at any moment, but I've read and saw many detective works and this is just not amazing at all. <br>I don't think it matters that much if you call him a trap or androgyn (if he is a master of disguise, trap would fit better imho).<br>I don't know why you are mentioning all these other works, but I won't like this more, just because other series did the same. The characters really don't grow on me at all and I don't feel immersed.<br>But I guess I am also just shallow</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It makes the entire setting fucking stupid. <br>Better stupid than boring, as long as the mysteries themselves are good enough the setting doesn't matter.</br></br>  Does this air at 720p? So I don't bother comparing with the upscale.  <br>Even the teacher thought he was a girl.<br>You can not possibly think he doesn't look a bit like a girl.<br>Have you seen dat ass?</br></br></br>  <br>It's good because he goes trapping later on.</br>  <br> He looks like a boy </br>  <br>I find it hard to hear the words "I'm going to exonerate myself by finding the real killer" from a 13 year boygirl. I also get the feel the show is a bit too fast paced for a mystery. A lot of the fun comes from letting the audience guess things out and figure out what the protagonist is trying to do. This ep they tried to push things along to establish some character shots and personalities. That's more a problem with trying to adapt written mysteries into televised mysteries imo. Especially when they are limited to 30 minute segments.</br>  <br>Kid, get out with your "babbys first animu".</br>   SO QUIRKY detective who thinks gruesome murder is FUN <br>I hate this fucking meme.</br>  Judging by this thread I'm not missing out if I skip this show.<br>Thanks.</br>  <br>I'll give it the old three episode treatment.</br>  <br>Is it a meme? What are some other examples?</br>  <br>I like it.</br>  <br>What am I looking at and why does it hurt so much?</br>  <br>Give it a chance, it's actually pretty good.<br>If you watch and don't like it nothing lost.<br>If you watch and like it, it was worth it.<br>Also don't act like you'd be losing time because we all know no one on /a/ has anything better to do.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They look like two pieces of warabi mochi covered with kinako flour. That shit's good but the flour gets fucking everywhere.</br>  Expected nothing and ended up liking it a lot, it was really entertaining.  <br>literally my thought process. first ep was nice</br>  <br>Muh dreams.</br>  <br>noitaminA is Animation backwards, hope that helps you remember how to spell it.</br>  Butterfly mom?  <br>I'm not sold on this show yet but /a/ is being way too critical of it.</br>  <br>That's an e. Butterfly meme</br>  <br>noimatina has been shit since samurai flamenco</br>  <br>I think /a/'s pretty critical of Lerche in general, they're not the best but they're trying a little now</br>  Who is the culprit?  If I didn't like the characters should I just drop it? Or will the story be worth it enough to overlook them?<br><br>I have no knowledge of the author or the stories this is based on at all, just what I have read on this thread. Would it be a requirement to know more about them to watch (enjoy) this?</br></br>  <br>They get a little bit better each time, no doubt Saijaku Bahamut will be amazing, especially with based Orange doing the 3DCG</br>  <br>Fix your colors.</br>  <br>Or you could just not use funi's shitty encodes and hardsubs in the first place.</br>  <br>I think my colors are fine, it's just that they didn't fix funi's horrible quality like HS did.</br>  <br> Is it because of all the homo? <br>Nope. That's the only reason I haven't dropped it yet, actually.</br></br>  <br>HS and AU are both Funi rips.</br>  I fixed it.  Well, that wasn't that bad. I'm going to keep watching, as long as the mysteries are interesting I don't care about the rest.  <br>You SHOULD care, sausagefests like this only attract fujos and yadda yadda more shitposting yadda yadda.</br>  <br>I'd avoid the threads anyway</br>  What a little fucking slut.  <br>What's with Seiji and traps?</br>  <br>my dick is the only reason I'll keep watching this<br><br> hopefully it does well and we get a lot of doujins, too </br></br></br>  <br>We can go deeper, edgier.</br>  <br>I assume some of it is just an indirect homolust thing. They can see full well it's a guy but emphasize that's he's girly.<br><br>The rest is just bad intuition. Target demographic was pretty easy to guess from a glance. It would be poor marketing otherwise.</br></br></br>  <br>Nagisa looks way more like a girl than this MC.<br><br> I'd still fuck both anyway </br></br></br>   super genius works for the government as a detective <br>That is so retarded.</br>  <br>I have no idea but I'm grateful for it</br>  I hope the real mystery is how that MC manages to have a dick<br><br>It's just mean to do that to such a cute girl</br></br>  <br>The trap legitimately did it but set it up to look like someone else framed them</br>  <br>Is it more retarded than super genius turns into a kid because of some weird poison?</br>  <br>The viewer.</br>  It's hard to tell if the trap and super genius detective characters are shit because they're setting up some kind of plot or if they are just shit characters  <br>I'm fully aware of this. You should not watch this anime yet, because it's only available as shitty funi rips.</br>  <br>Marche's ass</br>  <br>So far there's nothing more to them than being special snowflakes who think murder is fun. So shit.</br>  <br>They're pretty relatable for a viewer that enjoy detective shows and therefore also think solving murders is fun.</br>  <br>Well yeah, but this is a mystery series so the first episode could look entirely different come season's end</br>  <br><br>That's a holdover from ye olde mystery days. Holmes never particularly cared for his customers or about the things in his cases. He truly ever cared about the game, and since Ranpo based his work off of Doyle we have this as a result.</br></br>   great OP <br> actual show is generic anime bullshit <br>why is this allowed.</br></br>  <br>I'd be surprised if this wasn't the case, the series is clearly going to end with the trap being sent to jail to be gangraped for the rest of his life.</br>  MC is a girl.<br><br>You can't tell me otherwise.<br><br>My belief is the only thing that matters.</br></br></br></br>  Now i actually am glad Its Lerche with spoon budget doing that show, since too much attention to it turns threads into shit with trap fags and adhd fags.<br><br>Looking like shit, theres still possibility it`ll be not popular enougth, so that people watching it for actual story could discuss it.</br></br>  Has anyone said they're going to sub this yet?  <br><br>I hope it ends up having the UNGO crowd only</br></br>  About MC personality. Everyone assumes he is sociopath, because of his lack of display of emotion - but there is other possibility.<br><br>He is a detective genius. I.e. he reacts the way he does because he does not have time to panic - he "reads" the situation immidiately, just like how he figured out where Akechi lived.<br><br>So waking up with a murder weapon at crime scene, rather than scream from shock, he immidiately deducted the situation he is in and predicted how it will develop, thus had no reason to panic. Indeed, it is all for him a game.<br><br>Its shown he is not just excited for adventure and danger - he is actual detective/mystery fag, comming to Akechi house he immidiately assumes things there are needed for cases, knows how police work and how such things are solved (and does not care bit about him being accusing being sure he can find a real murderer).<br><br>If thats correct, that would also mean he already deducted lot more than was shown to us this episode. He could have not noticed that female teacher was Akechi and his scars. Should have knew things about the dead teacher, if he`s so observant too (which ironically, also makes him a possible culprit), and that Akechi planned to manipulate him to use as a bait for the real killer (that was the point why there was no scandal, and why he was arrested for 2nd time).<br><br>Still though, he`s not what one would call a normal person. But maybe, not a emotionless sociopath, just a person not panicing in the storm because knowing where lifeboat is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So he's an autistic sociopath</br>  <br>Sociopath is a mental condition, one of key points of which is inability to feel normal emotions. He`s at best autistic psyhopath, but more likely just shizophrene.</br>  I reckon it was the genius detective guy that planned it all and murdered the teacher. <br><br>It would at least make for a semi interesting plot rather than the normal "hard genius detective solves crimes with younger genius detective"</br></br>  <br>Mysteries don't work that way.</br>  <br>Maybe the real mystery is that it isn't a mystery after all</br>  <br>We dont know yet if the case it that simple yet. That could be the possibility if its episodic ark that is created just to introduce us to characters. If its something deeper however, like say Man of 20 Faces - then it will be much more complex and involve more victims and relevant characters.<br><br>I expect "another" or "9 niggers" like plot where everyone around MC is dieing one by one at least in one ark of the show.</br></br></br>  <br>Could definitely be so, but the funnest thing about these types of series' is speculating based on what information you've been given.</br>  So the detective is the new sensei? Fuck this shit full of traps.  <br>I'm starting to think I've been tricked into watching Gay: The Anime</br>  Normally, I'd give a show a few episodes, or at least a full episode.<br>But I dropped this 30 seconds after they tried to claim the MC is a male.<br>I don't mind traps but that combined with all the other stupid cliches they began throwing in at lightspeed puts this in a level of WHY that I cannot tolerate.</br></br>  First episode was hypeeee  So Kobayashi is a sociopath, right?  Oh fuck this. Fuck this so much.<br>I can't pay attention to anything aside from the fact that I want to fuck his boypussy. Shit Kobayashi makes me feel something fierce. Something fierce.<br><br>God damn that is distracting.</br></br></br>  <br> Autistic psychopath <br><br>So he's got Asperger's Syndrome.</br></br></br>  <br>He is Savant, not assburger. For either though he lacks notable ticks.</br>  disgusting   Simulcast: Funimation <br>This season looks like the actual death of fansubbing to me, with UTW and caffiene now officially ded. And all these funi rips will mean shit video and questionable translation for everybody, but no groups will bother with most of the shows they get.</br>  MC is the most literal display of autism I've ever seen in anime   boy <br><br><br>u fukkin wot m8.  Also this show is hella gay </br></br></br>  <br>Yep. Fuck this show.</br>  Full OP/ED when?  <br>Too deep for you</br>  <br>It's not deep when they walk you through every fucking plot point.</br>  This show will have tons of asspulls won't it?  <br>I can swear you did not understand (or even pick up to your concious) even 1/10th of what was shown on screen.<br><br>For example explain the relevance of Sofa in Adachi`s house, dollhouse MC passes by, orchids MC sees, butterflies and cross shaped scar on skulls.</br></br></br>  <br>not sure about pulls, but the ass is already plentiful</br>  <br>Go away, impostor.</br>  <br>Man, I want to care but I'd rather read the fucking stories. It's not my fault the anime script doesn't do the source materials justice.</br>  Otaku shit  <br>So, just a shitposter as expected.</br>  <br>That entire fucking post</br>  <br>Was Otaku shit already in 1925.</br>  To those who theorize that the female teacher is Akechi, how is Akechi modulating his height between roles? <br>It's not really possible to make himself shorter in order to play the teacher's role. <br>Are you thinking that Akechi has been wearing stilts the entire time and just takes them off when he plays the teacher?</br></br>    <br>Posture. You can see the teacher is in knees bend posture.</br>  Why do you think "otaku" community is so ridiculed on society?  <br>I thought this was going to be a wannabe corpse party from that image</br>  Anyone thinking all kinds of deviation, homo eroticism, traps, guro and psychopaths is Otaku phenomenon, never did read japanese classic litterature.<br><br>For heavens sake, their one of most known 12th century classic novels deals with harem fag seducing women (including childs) and sexual deviation fantasies.</br></br>   drills <br> eccentric homeroom teacher <br> loli appearance <br> MAI FUCKING NAKAHARA <br><br>She is mine, no one else can take her.

Like his mentor, he is an expert at disguise and is especially adept at posing as a young woman.  <br><br>Main enemy, "Man of 20 Faces" is even better at that, being able to take almost any persons place.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I swear I read something about the detective having the ability to appear as a teenage girl yesterday, but I can't find it anywhere  <br><br><br>So it will be just like <br><br><br><br><br>Thats lame</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, it IS inspired by Sherlock holmes novels. <br><br>Akechi = Sherlock<br>Kobayashi = Watson + head of street kids Sherlock used</br></br></br></br>  <br>Akeshi's eyes are more orange than the teacher's, but yada yada colored contacts.<br><br>Also, how the hell does Akeshi reshape his face in order to pull this off?</br></br></br>  Is Hedgehog's Dilemma just a friendly way of saying Autism in Japan?  But shinji doesnt want to go fast  They clearly do not have mental doctors in the evangelion universe.  No, it is not a concept that originated in Japan, nor does it have anything to do with autism.<br><br>You're an idiot.</br></br>  <br>He wants to go fast into Kaworu's butthole if OP's pic is any indication.</br>  <br> actually taking this seriously <br>Are you retarded?</br></br>  "Onward to the Promised Resort! Vegeta Goes on a Family Trip?!"<br>The Prince of the Saiyans Vegeta’s Family Time!<br>Vegeta goes out with Bulma and Trunks to a resort area! Bulma and Trunks are very happy with this unexpected family time together! But even as he’s doing this, Vegeta is bothered that Goku is off training?!</br></br>  I'm okay with all this   SoL episodes <br>this is literal the best thing ever in this franchise</br>  Give me 12 episodes of SoL before any action filled arcs. I can't wait to see the US fanbase cry.  <br>Look you have a zillion other anime that are SoL and while a few episode helps flesh out Dragon Ball, the show needs action to BE Dragon Ball.<br>If you want a SoL look away.</br></br>  Vegeta trying to be best dad  <br><br>No, it really doesn't. Dragon Ball can be anything. It began as a comedy/adventure show, before slowly seeping in some martial arts. Then we went full battle shounen before things went to total shit in the Boo arc. The series can be whatever it wants now. <br><br>Give me something like Battle of Gods and the 2008 Special and we're good.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck is that?<br>I can barely even recognize the series at this point.<br><br>This is what happens when you plan out 500 chapters by progressing without any meaningful continuity.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok Ill agree that DB can be anything and on Battle of Gods, had a very good mix of action and SoL<br>But the series has always had some action to it. Even if it's Goku as a kid blowing up a car he thinks is a wild animal.</br></br>  <br><br>And by the looks of it, it still has action. The preview shows Trunks and Beerus in action. <br><br>I just get tired of this fanbase. They're either whining about "Granny Goku" and anything that isn't their beloved (aka fucking awful) dub, or cursing Toriyama over horseshit. Battle power stuff is literally cancer, too. <br><br>Anything to make that type of fan upset is fine by me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So this is when he and bulma make their daughter?  <br>I hope the third episode focuses on Krillin's family.</br>  <br>Is this set betwen dbz and gt the same as bog and rof ?</br>  <br><br>This takes place 6 months after the defeat of Boo, during the 10 year time period prior to the end of Z.</br></br>  <br><br>GT is not canon.</br></br>  <br>I see. I just repeated how toei said it in the press conference how they see the 2 newest movies.</br>  <br><br>Everything points to a retelling of the two movies as arcs before moving into a confirmed new arc that takes Goku to a different universe.</br></br>  <br>The press conference said different. The newest movie is described betwen dbz episode and gt.</br>  <br>I see. I have read the synopsis. So this is super's preview.</br>  <br>Like how the Buu saga started?</br>  <br>SoL would flesh out Dragon Ball more than any 20 minute screaming montage ever would.</br>  <br> Vegeta goes out with Bulma and Trunks to a resort area! <br><br>And to think that this man once genocided planets for a living.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Not really. The Saiyaman stuff did nothing for me. Something like the early parts of the 2008 special would be nice.</br></br>  <br>Let's not kid ourselves. Dragonball even at it's roots felt way closer to a slice of life than a punch party. It was just an adventurous slice of life before shit they started fightin' it out more and more.</br>  <br>What is with people dissing the best arc? It's CELL saga that felt like a drag. Buu saga is a silly fun ride with a really enjoyable villain/jokes.   I hated it too until I reread the manga  </br>  <br><br>And this new series will retell them. GT still not canon.</br></br>  <br>They're my favorite couple in the entire series.   I want them to train Maron. For some reason it bugs me to think that Maron wouldn't learn SOMETHING from her fight happy hick of a father OR the world famous invincible old Master, Muten Roshi </br>  <br>Your flawed logic won't make any different. You are making no sense</br>  Is Vegeta better father than the "yeah sorry" man   Slice of Life episodes <br><br>yeeeeesssssss<br>vegeta driving episode when</br></br></br>  <br>I really like Goku and Vegeta's dynamic. Vegeta is a great foil for Goku's childlike attitude, while being more like a "too cool for school" type teenager to Goku's ambitious preteen.</br>  <br><br>Super is going to have BoG and RoF Arcs that are different than the movies. Thus movies don't matter and your argument about GT being canon is DESTROYED.</br></br>  <br>Vegeta's a better Father than Goku. Although that's not much of an accomplishment.</br>  <br><br>The manga is the best way to enjoy the series, but I still don't think the Boo arc is particularly great regardless.<br><br>Vegeta may have been good for years within the internal timeline, but we as readers haven't experienced that enough to make his fall into evil feel anywhere near as poignant as it should have been.<br><br>Goten and Trunks simply don't get enough character development to warrant their existence. They sadly feel like fusion fodder -- a technique that already feels poorly written.<br><br>When you begin fusing characters as a means to power up, you've definitely lost a lot of narrative power. Especially when you do it twice within one arc. <br><br>Structurally, it's a shame that Japanese readers didn't take to Gohan like they did Goku. Though I understand that Gohan isn't into fighting; narratively, he's set up to be the next savior. When that falls flat, we're ultimately left with Goku sporting an absurd new form and part of an insane concept.<br><br>I agree that the Cell arc drags, and it certainly has its own fair share of problems stemming from a distinct lack of comedy. While the Boo arc does bring back the humour, it is still extremely poor from a storytelling perspective.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He said the end of Z.<br>Last chapter of DBZ was Goku fighting Uub, which was 10 years after the defeat of Kid Buu.</br></br>  <br>The only thing that destroyed is your logic</br>  <br><br> Is this set betwen dbz and gt? </br></br>  <br>Vegeta is a surprisingly good father/husband when you consider his upbringing.</br>  <br>well yeah, it's not that hard to be a better father than Goku considering he spent most of years as a kid living in the woods by himself</br>  <br>More bingo-level retardation please, the tears would be delicious.</br>  <br><br>Tears?  </br></br>  Has Super already started?  <br>Dragon Ball was goofy slapstick bullshit though.</br>  <br><br>No. It begins on July 5th. OP posted the second episode title, which we found in a newspaper clipping. The first episode will cover the events shown in the first promo manga: Goku farming, Beerus destroying planets etc.</br></br>  <br>Fair points.<br> Vegeta may have been good for years within the internal timeline, but we as readers haven't experienced that enough to make his fall into evil feel anywhere near as poignant as it should have been. <br>I feel like the Vegeta Evil part is supposed to feel not so poignant. I always got this feeling that Vegeta's bluffing, almost as if he's going through a midlife crisis. He wants to get back to his roots. To who he is. But that's just not who he is anymore. Sure he kills a lot of people, but I'd honestly take that a lot more seriously if Vegeta didn't know that they had an undo button that could rectify that at any time. I just always read that as him lashing out at Goku for not taking fighting him seriously.<br> Goten and Trunks simply don't get enough character development to warrant their existence. They sadly feel like fusion fodder -- a technique that already feels poorly written. <br>Fair point. I never was a fan of the fact that they could just...turn super saiyan (even if it gives us one of my favorite lines out of Vegeta) It would've been cool if they both achieved the form while training with Piccolo (seeing as how they both experience the death of a parent to draw their rage from). I feel like neither of them really stand to well on their own as characters so I can get what you mean though.<br>  I hate super saiyan 3. It looks stupid. But I get it from a conceptual standpoint.  </br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to fucking see the Resurrection of F movie. <br>Fuck this world.</br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br> not waiting for the uncut version and watching it like it was supposed to be seen </br>  <br>It really feels like DBZ is playing up how shitty a dad Goku can be just to give him "something" or the new series.<br><br>I mean, he wasn't that great before, but yeah.</br></br></br>  What kind of short little adventures would you like to see in Super.<br><br>I'd really like an adventure with Bulma and Chi-chi in the vein of an old Dragonball episode. Bulma needs to do something and needs some muscle and Goku and Vegeta are out training.</br></br>  <br><br> I always got this feeling that Vegeta's bluffing, almost as if he's going through a midlife crisis. He wants to get back to his roots. <br><br>That's really my point, though. We haven't experienced Vegeta as a proper, relatable antagonist at this point. Up until the Boo arc, he's been this salty ex-villain who's _kinda_ good, but still not quite there. If we'd been privy to him playing the family man in an arc prior to this, then it would have been perfect. As it stands, there's just not enough build-up of 'good' to make his descent into 'bad' feel worthwhile. <br><br>Can you imagine Vegeta descending into evil after something like Battle of Gods? It would be an absolutely huge contrast, and SO much more effective.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the way it currently plays out a lot. It's hard not to love an excuse to have two rivals battle it out. I just wish it had been executed a little better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So...<br>Fukkatsu No F with spanish subs is out since a few days/1 week, italian subs will be ready and out on July 7th.<br>Both those subs communities are normally the slowest ones in providing subs for animes and movies from japan,(especially since they sometimes use the english sub as refrence for better translations) with the english one preceding both of them by at least a few weeks, usually 1 month or more...why the heck there is still no eng subs for it?</br></br>  <br><br>Full, clear Japanese audio wasn't available until recently. English community has better things to do than sub a cam rip... Like complaining about everything.</br></br>  <br>Hercule and Buu trying to stop some new villain on their own</br>  <br>An episode dedicated to Krillin's family. <br>Bonus points if we actually see Krillin and 18 team up to fight some random villain of the week.<br>Even more bonus points if we see Goku and/or any of the other Saiyans show up at the end only to see that the enemy has been beaten.<br><br>Really, I would like to see an episode where there are no Saiyans at all but I don't think Toei has the balls to do that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, I thought it kinda worked, at least with the Anime version, you see more of him being 'normal' and you kind of take it for granted who he's been most of his life.</br>  <br><br> 2015 <br> Still calling him Hercule <br><br>It's okay, you can say Satan now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hercule just sounds better especially for a strongest man in the world title</br>  <br>god dammit bulma looks hot</br>  <br> Fukkatsu No F with spanish subs is out since a few days/1 week <br>Because the spanish dub is in latin american cinemas alredy. Watched it myself yesterday</br></br>  <br>That's</br>    <br> Full, clear Japanese audio wasn't available until recently. <br>Yeah, for everyone though.<br>I just wonder why the normally fastest subs community hasnt released(or announced) their version yet, especially since the 2 most slow ones have already.<br><br> English community has better things to do than sub a cam rip <br>The community dedicated to do subs for japanese movies, which constantly do subs for cam rips, has better things to do than do subs for a cam rip, right....<br><br><br>If that was the reason, then why releasing the jap cam rip with spanish subs instead of the spanish dub cam rip? Or the jap cam rip with spanish audio(like they often do)?<br>Not to mention the spanish subs community has announced they were working on their version(and subsequently announced the release date) way before the movie was released in latin american cinemas.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who's announced their subs? I don't keep up with subbers as much as I'd like to so I'm rather out of the loop.</br>  <br> Can you imagine Vegeta descending into evil after something like Battle of Gods? It would be an absolutely huge contrast, and SO much more effective. <br>Again? Well after his moment fighting against Kid Buu? That would be a more disservice to the character than what they're doing to Gohan.<br><br>If he wants to punch Goku in the face, all he has to do is ask. It's not like Goku's going to say no at this point.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not that it matters since his canon name is Satan, same goes for Kuririn and Tenshinhan.</br>  <br>I'd really love this. And Buu is Mr. Satan's sidekick so he's just on the sidelines most of the time while Mr. Satan fails and helps him out with his magic with questionable results.</br>  <br>Spanish subs community announced they were working on spanish subs around June 12-14th, and announced the release date(June 26th) on June 20th.<br>Italian subs community announced they were working on spanish subs June 22nd, and announced the release date(July 7th) on June 30th.<br>No words from the english community, and when they're asked, all they say is "when we'll have news we'll share it"</br></br></br>  <br>I think what he's saying is if INSTEAD of turning evil during the Buu saga if it was something that happened after Battle of the Gods, now that we're more accustomed to family man good guy Vegeta.</br>  How long until Vegeta's daughteru is born?  <br> Italian subs community announced they were working on spanish subs <br>meant<br>Italian subs community announced they were working on italian subs</br></br></br>  <br>I'll call him Mr. Satan and I even like Tenshinhan but nothing's gonna get me to start calling him Kuririn.</br>  <br><br>No, I'm using BoG as an example of the type of Vegeta we should have seen prior to turning.<br><br>I'm not saying it should happen again!</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>A few hours ago another Italian subs group has announced their version will be out tomorrow.<br>Yet no english one...</br></br></br>  <br>THIS.<br>All day, all nigth.</br></br>  <br>But that's the point. Vegeta shouldn't finally graduate to family man until after he goes Majin. <br><br>It'd have been more shocking, but it would also completely ruin the point</br></br></br>  <br>Naming someone like him Satan has always been stupid to me.</br>  <br>What's the point of making Vegeta evil again?</br>  <br>Take your complains to Toriyama then. In my opinion calling hbim Hercule is stupid</br>  <br><br>Isn't his name Hercule Satan? What's the point in arguing?</br></br>  <br>I really like Krillin and 18. I want to see them do stuff with Maron.</br>  <br> Kuririn  <br>kill yourself<br>his name is Infinite Hands</br></br></br>  <br>It's not.<br> His name is Mr. Satan in the original Japanese media, however, he is referred to as Hercule in FUNimation's English dub (though he retains his original name in unedited releases), as well as Viz Media's English versions of the manga. This is attributed to the typical process in Dragon Ball (and shōnen in general) of stripping Judeo-Christian references for the sensitivities of Western audiences. "Hercule" originates from Hercules, the Greek hero who was the son of Zeus in mythology. </br></br>  <br>toryiama said his first name is actually mark</br>  <br><br>I'm kinda curious to see if Chi-Chi still rides the Nimbus to go shopping and stuff.<br><br>Goten adventures.<br><br>An episode with Pilaf's gang getting the dragon balls and fucking up their wish for youth.<br><br>Goku visiting Penguin village, maybe with Goten, and visiting android 8 and the girl from the winter village.<br><br>Grandpa Gohan<br><br> Launch </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>let's hope for a continuation of that niku ringo doujin</br>  <br>Original japanese name is Mr Satan(Misutā Satan), Hercule Satan(which is just the official full name, he always gets called just Hercule) is how he was named in the FUNimation Dub</br>  <br>Sasuke Uchiha is a (surprisingly somehow) watered down version of Vegeta combined with bad writing.<br><br><br>And that's sad, considering Sasuke had the potential to be a refined version of Vegeta that was supposed to have better character development, but that goes to show how shit Kishimoto writing skills are.<br><br>About parenting, Vegeta has the upper hand, even though we know now Sasuke seems to genuinely appreciate his also seememgly neglected daughter.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>17 the park ranger.</br></br>  <br>Yes please.</br>  <br><br>Because, even though Videl's family naming follows a religious or mythological pattern, the name Hercule is only in your version, Amerifriend.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure his name is Mark Satan.</br>  <br>Do you think Arale would still look the same or get an upgraded adult body.   I bet she tried to get senbei to get her a sexy body to enhance her "feminine charms" </br>  <br>Actually his name is just Mark<br> In the tradition of Dragon Ball name puns, Mr. Satan and his family are named after demons/figures from mythology and religion. His daughter's name, Videl, is an anagram of the word "devil". His granddaughter, Pan, can also be taken to mean the figure from Greek mythology (though since her father is Gohan, it could just as easily mean "bread"; given Toriyama's love of puns, it could be both). The Super Exciting Guide: Character Volume includes interviews with Toriyama, and he is asked about Mister Satan's real name in one of them. Toriyama mentions that Mister Satan is just the character's ring name reminiscent of that of a pro grappler and that his real name is Mark (マーク, Maaku),[2][3] which is a romanization of a rearrangement of Akuma (Japanese for devil). Since the region where Satan lives does not split up names into given names and family names, his name is simply "Mark".[3] <br> Since the region where Satan lives does not split up names into given names and family names, his name is simply "Mark".[3] <br>Mr Satan is just his pseudonym</br></br></br></br>  <br>Apparently that dude has a wife and kids too.

Similarly I assume the manga kept Krillin as Kuriririn because of his hat during the freiza arc.</br>  <br><br><br> tfw the dub will never use the term 'Pichi-pichi gal' </br></br></br>  <br>This guy gets it.<br>I also hope we get more of Krillin and 18 being cute.</br></br>  <br>He's also gotten better at lying because there's no way in hell he thinks Chi-chi is flatchested.</br>  <br>Funi's subtitles keep 'Kuririn' as well. It's more accurate to be read that way, but speaking it in English would be kind of a mouthful, so 'Krillin' is a decent enough approximation.</br>  <br>Tsundere Juuhachigou, nnngh..</br>  <br><br>Why the fuck do Fundamentalist Christfags ruin everything? literally ISIS-lite.</br></br>  <br>I really want more Goku and Arale.

Middle fingers, boobs, Popo's lips, Adjutant Black's lips, No.17's gun, a handful of racy lines of dialogue, 'Hercule,' 'Herculopolis.' Not sure about Dr. Slump though, but probably some of the more pervy jokes like in DB.</br>  <br>Killing Cell also takes a toll</br>   Mfw the US fanbase realizes that Dragon Ball Super is 90% comedy, with 50% of the episodes being SoL <br><br>I wonder what is Funimation going to do to bastardize the series again.</br></br>  <br><br>Attempt to make it serious like what they're doing with Revival of F. I can expect major anger if it turns back into Dragon Ball. I liked that since Beerus and Whis showed up, it balanced it out.</br></br>  <br>Funi has somewhat gotten their shit together in recent years. Kai and BoG had a pretty decent dub, all things considered, and F looks like it probably will too. They're still clutching onto shit like 'Tien' and 'Supreme Kai' but other than that they're mostly treating the franchise with respect  other than the pisspoor DVDs and horrid Z BDs .</br>  <br>You are aware Funimation isn't in the 90s anymore and dub Dragonball practically 1:1 with the original script these days right?</br>  <br> Rename it to Dragon Ball Z: Super <br> Swap out orchestrated background music for generic "fighting" music </br></br>  <br>No<br><br>I know this won't happen but just joking about another fucking replacement soundtrack triggers me</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Rename it to Dragon Ball Z: Super <br>I could see that happening even though I hope they won't<br> &gt;Swap out orchestrated background music for generic "fighting" music <br>They don't do that any more either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is great, it sows that Vegeta changed and is a better father than Goku who frequently abandons his family, depending on the writing it could be really good.</br>  <br>It's a fact that toei said gt is canon. So, shut up.</br>  <br>Kek</br>    <br><br>They don't do that anymore with the music.

Nothing Vegeta does with Kid Trunks will erase the abuse Future Trunks received along with the neglect kid Trunks got. <br><br>Goku was shown to care more about Goten, Trunks and Gohan more than Vegeta did and it wasn't because he wasn't conveniently going off to die.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't read moon so...I'll have to take your word for it.</br>  <br>I seem to remember the anime subs saying something along the lines of 'Chichi's chichis aren't that impressive, ' not that she was flat-chested, per se.</br>  <br><br>From Funi's subs, which are pretty much the #1 source as far as translation reliability:<br><br>'N-No... she ain't got any more bounce left, and I'd get killed!'</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey so I know that the English sub for revival of F is out now does anyone know where I can find it?</br>   Abandons his newborn child and mate to train for 3 years, despite said mate providing him shelter and training facilities after being homeless. <br><br> Not only allows said newborn and mate to be used as a distraction, by the very guy that he was training the above-mentioned 3 years to defeat, literally leaves them for dead, if not for his son, from an alternate timeline, intervening. <br><br> Knowingly abuses and manipulates the feelings of this son, from an alternative timeline, to the point said son purposely does shitty training, so he wouldn't hurt his father's pride over the possibility of his power being higher than his own. <br><br> Not only allows the being who killed his son, from an alternate timeline, to reach his perfect form, just to stroke his ego, does so against the pleas of said son from that alternate timeline, which ultimately results in said son getting killed. <br><br> Upon the death of his son, from an alternate timeline, actually grieves for him, yet still goes on to neglect his real son, for seven years of peace, to pointlessly compete with the son of his one-sided rival, despite this person's son not only having zero interest in training, and getting gravely injured to save his ass, despite he himself had sworn off ever fighting again. <br><br> Openly admits that he neglected his son and mate, for seven years, to the point he never held his son and only does so moments before going off to die, due to being directly responsible for releasing a monster that ultimately kills said son. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's pretty much a direct translation. Goku says "i-iya, aitsu wa puri puri jya ne shi... ko korosare chimau yo..." or "She ain't got the jiggle/bounce. I-I'll be killed!" though he says the second part weirdly which i'm guessing is his "hick" talk.</br>  <br>The guy who did Funi's subs is a longtime fan and pretty much a DB expert, I wouldn't expect anything less.</br>  <br><br>As bad as Vegeta is the Sauce is worse. Knocking up your wife and leaving her with a kid for 12 years on a secret mission to find space aliens.</br></br>  Scanlations by: https://mofogoku.wordpress.com/  <br> Upon the death of his son, from an alternate timeline, actually grieves for him, yet still goes on to neglect his real son <br>What? That never happened.</br></br>  Just because I've never seen this mentioned around...<br>It's funny that Goku's super outfit is the same as Vegeta's brother OVA. <br>And the animation style feels the same. <br>I can't help but thinking that they slowly started doing episodes from that moment on. <br>That's the reason the first episodes have this funny beat to them. <br>Somewhere along the line all the Gods and Universe's stuff sounded like a good idea and they went for it. The movies were just merch research to see that the people would (obviously) go crazy about them.<br><br>After all, that OVA's title was "Goku and their friends return".<br><br>This is probably all too obvious now, but I can't help to think that's how it went down. Kai just gave them some time not to rush it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lets go all out and invite beelzebub and kajika</br>  <br><br>Going off the manga, Vegeta makes it apparent that he's spent almost entirety of his time training to surpass SSJ2 Kid Gohan, since he's not at all surprised that Goku has access to SSJ2 during the fight with Yarkon. <br><br>Also, Vegeta doesn't even take a serious interest in training Trunks until after he realizes that both Trunks and Goten are able to go SSJ and that's only after finding out they're going to be in the tournament on top of Goku coming back.<br><br>Alternatively, it's kinda sad how kid Trunks was only allowed to walk around in the gravity chamber with his dad, but brags to his mom how it's training.<br><br>Whereas Chichi not only taught Goten how to fight, but apparently sparred with him until realizing he can turn SSJ.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks so much, Anon!</br>    <br>So the actual training Vegeta did with Trunks where he ended up crying, then Vegeta making good on the promise to go to the park, never happened in the manga?<br>My childhood sucks.</br></br>  <br>If this goes SoL it will be a flop like GT.</br>  <br>Vegeta made the promise but we never see Vegeta take trunks to the park. We can assume he did though.</br>  <br>But that's literally the opposite of what's wrong with GT.</br>  <br>why?<br><br>toriyama is good at comedy, and dragon ball is not for super edgy stuff i think it will be great as a sol with super powers <br><br><br>gt went too edgy with ss4 and the whole baby thing and dark dragon balls that's why it failed</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So who's gonna sub this?</br>  <br> Whereas Chichi not only taught Goten how to fight, but apparently sparred with him until realizing he can turn SSJ. <br><br>Based Chichi.<br><br><br> beelzebub <br><br>Been there, done that. I'm sure sure his dad is Dabura.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So the actual training Vegeta did with Trunks where he ended up crying, then Vegeta making good on the promise to go to the park, never happened in the manga? <br> My childhood sucks. <br><br>It was more of a spar in the manga and it only came after the announcement that Goku is coming back and kid Trunks tells Vegeta that he regularly competes with Goten.<br><br>I doubt he had time to take Trunks to the park, since the shit with Majin Buu happens afterwards and we only get another panel of Vegeta training alone. I'm sure Super will fix that, based on this family vacation episode.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Dragon Ball GT <br> SoL </br></br>  <br><br><br>It flopped because they gave nothing of what the fans wanted. The first episodes were pure shit, and when they came up with Baby and SSJ4 it was already way too late, it flopped.</br></br></br>  <br>Baby is the worst thing in GT.<br>  People like SS4 and I don't understand why. It looks so tryhard.Even more than SS3.  </br></br>  <br>baby was fucking awful</br>  <br>yeah,maybe beelzebub and kajika just live in universe 6 and his dad is alternate universe dabura<br><br>also kajika still needs to save 1000 lives to break his curse<br><br>and super is giving us what we want good comedy and power level Shenanigans so it's going to be a succes</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  The first episodes were pure shit, and when they came up with Baby and SSJ4 it was already way too late, it flopped. <br>Both were utter shit, the only thing that GT did right was the finale <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3vO<wbr>Z8UOiSXw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>When I was a wee lil 13 year old, some girl asked me what was better in DBGT than in Z. I replied it was animated better, but it had less interesting fights and came off as boring. Later on I thought DBZ actually had really nonexistent plot after the Android Saga and that they did really last too long. By comparison DBGT seemed slightly better, it's just that I couldn't get into it since I was used to all the screaming excitement of Z.<br>Tell me anons, was I full of shit back then or after? For some reason it embarrasses me whenever I think about it.</br></br>  <br>did you fuck</br>  <br>You probably like SSG design.<br><br><br>It was shit but definitely not as shit as dancing Vegeta.<br><br><br> super is giving us what we want good comedy <br>Literally only /a/ wants that. Sound like won't be getting much money.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I remember how that scene was horribly butchered in the dub, seriously, it hurts when you compare it to the original.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=BgO<wbr>9qhw1FvY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>Z only:<br><br>Namek Saga &gt; Saiyan Saga &gt; Buu Saga &gt; Android Saga &gt; Cell Games &gt; Majin Saga</br></br></br></br>  <br> not as shit as dancing Vegeta. <br>kill yourself</br></br>  <br><br>also i forgot to add the anime sucks because the pacing is retarded<br><br>read the manga</br></br></br></br>  <br>You seem like a guy who doesn't really get the tropes dragon ball made a point to set up. It's not the kind of series that should be taken too seriously.</br>  <br>So what's /a/'s favorite saga overall?<br>Mine is Piccolo Daimao's<br> mfw he blew up shenron </br></br></br>  <br>Counterpoint.<br>Buu Saga&gt;Saiyan Saga&gt;Majiin Saga&gt; Android Saga=Namek Saga&gt; Cell Games</br></br>  <br><br>Red Ribbon Saga or Namek Saga for me. Red Ribbon is fucking funny. Namek is like the most defining part of the series and the last adventure before it resumes more big bad attacks Earth plot that started since Piccolo Daimao.</br></br>  <br>You need to be 18 or older to browse this website.</br>  <br> Vegeta gets arrested by Galactic Patrol and has to preform community service to clear his name <br> Goku and Piccolo tag along with Gohan to tour a university and end up joining a fraternity <br> Goku fills in as the Great Saiyaman and chaos ensues </br></br></br>  <br>Can we add Kintoki to the mix?</br>  <br>You do know that this is a prelude to BoG, RoF and Multiverse arcs right?<br><br>Of course you don't</br></br></br>  <br> Cell being &gt; anything <br>The only cell that's cool to watch is the mexican cell, and only because of his voice.</br></br>  <br>no<br> I just joined her anime club in high school <br>that doesn't answer my question, did GT have better animation and a plot with more depth (not necessarily better)?<br>I watched them again a few times after but it was terribly boring and I can't bring myself to watch both whole series again when I have a backlog</br></br></br></br>  <br>that's because the english dub never dubbed Dan Dan Kokoro Hikareteku<br><br>the latin american dub did it and i think it is as good as the japanese veresion<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=px2<wbr>o5xzd5ug</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I bet you think Dragon Ball is meant to be taken 100% seriously and that it's supposed to be silly and fun along with lots of fighting</br>  <br>Can't pick just one.<br>Red Ribbon saga has the best sense of adventure.<br>King Piccolo saga did the "grimdark" thing right.<br>Sayian saga is pure action, and almost every character feels useful.<br>Freeza saga has an amazing villain, finale, and I love the "hide and seek" thing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Excellent taste</br></br>  <br>I can't because Piccolo Daimao is my favorite overall</br>  <br> almost every character feels useful <br> almost </br></br>  <br>Yeah but that's Yamcha. Who even cares?</br>  <br> Red Ribbon Saga <br>Man, was this guy awesome</br></br>  <br><br>Yamcha's death served a purpose. <br><br>If he didn't get killed by that Saibaman, Kuririn and possibly Gohan would have likely died after getting caught off guard by this self-destruct ability.<br><br>Remember, Kuririn was supposed to fight next before Yamcha stepped in. And this was when Gohan was too scared to even fight back.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, Krillin killed the fuck out of those Saibamen too.

Saiyan arc starts with Goku getting killed while trying to save Gohan. After a year he comes back and saves Piccolo, Gohan and Kuririn, from Nappa, only to need Gohan, Kuririn and Yajirobe's help to finish Vegeta.<br><br>On Namek, he saved Vegeta, Gohan an Kuririn, before they died fighting the Ginyu Force, only for him to lose his body and get beaten so badly he doesn't show up again until it's time to fight Freeza. And even then it took Super Saiyan to beat Freeza, Future Trunks is the one of finished him off.<br><br>Goku doesn't even fight much during the Android arc and even fails to finish 19, before his heart starts to fail. He doesn't show up again until the fight with Cell and even then Gohan had already outclassed him in power and Goku made a point to train Gohan so he could fight Cell and STILL ended up dying.<br><br>For Buu, he spent the entire time pushing for Goten, Trunks and Gohan to be the saviors of the planet and spent his one day dealing with Majin Buu's shit due to Vegeta's faggotry.<br><br>Even then he doesn't save anyone and is unconscious and blamed by Goten and Trunks for Vegeta's and Gohan (supposed) deaths.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>After going back to the afterlife, after leaving Piccolo and Kuririn to teach the kids Fusion, Goku doesn't even interfere with Earth's problems again until literaly when Gohan fucks up fighting Super Buu and gets Piccolo and Gotenks absorbed, even then Goku comes back to assist Gohan, who still misses the earring and it ultimately comes down to Goku and Vegeta fusing.<br><br>After Vegetto saves everyone, only for Kid Buu to kill them and destory the Earth, the first thing Goku suggest is having the kids finish Buu off, but Vegeta shoots the idea down and has him use the Genki dama instead, which would a failed if not for Mr. Satan.<br><br>The only time Goku shits all over the rest of the cast and is the sole hero is during GT, but fuck GT.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Goku doesn't even fight much during the Android arc and even fails to finish 19, before his heart starts to fail. He doesn't show up again until the fight with Cell and even then Gohan had already outclassed him in power and Goku made a point to train Gohan so he could fight Cell and STILL ended up dying. <br><br>At best, Goku saved Tenshinhan and Piccolo, from Semi-Perfect Cell. That shouldn't really count since he literally popped in, grabbed them and popped back out via teleport.</br></br></br>  <br> that narrator  <br>what in the hell</br></br>  What's a good anime app for Android?
