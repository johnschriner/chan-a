[ A-1 [spoilerKae[/spoiler]delivers<br>TakeP smile status: PROTECTED</br>  So much Kaede today.  Someone remembered their promise.  post em up boys  Does anyone know if that japanese blogger that lurks here (and other sites) sometimes, posted anything about us being hype for S2 yet?  <br> Smile Protected </br>  Kaede-san...  I wanted to hate Mio like the rest, but I grew to like her.<br><br> Plus she built for sex and can be coerced easily. </br></br>  Why Mio so talented?<br>Will you buy her game?</br>  A-1 sure likes getting meta with their story set-ups.<br><br> Mio up in arms about girls getting cancelled/delayed debuts <br><br> CM1 batch news released <br> Most are puzzled as to why Kaede was one of the first chosen for a voice when there were several idols with more popularity than her at the time. <br> Koi Kaze was well received although her following was still comparatively small. <br> Years later <br> Kaede gradually grew into one of the most popular and beloved idols in CG <br> Episode is about not forgetting about where you started from </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Mio is a good girl.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128535416 <br>Go sleep, Verty.</br>  I want to read books with Fumi.  Which idol would you produce?  I'm left wanting more.  <br><br>Rika, Mika, Ana, Rin, Uzuki, Chuuni, Shy slut, Uzuuki, shit, bigger shit<br><br>In that order.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The NG show is back. Kaede thankfully got to be the extra flavor this episode, but by that she also had much more focus and characerization than the majority of the cast got, especially Chieri/Kanako/Rika/Miria who continue to be ignored.<br>Fucking A-1 has really done it for good this time, no hope for improving.</br></br>  <br>Anya, Mio, Mika, Rika, Ranko, Uzuki, Rin, Chieri, Anuz</br>  <br>Mandatory<br><br><br> Mio, Anya, Mika, Ranko, Rika </br></br></br></br>  Here we go again.    <br>I like you<br>Never seen another Anya/Mio top two</br></br>    <br><br> What Mishiro does on her off time </br></br>   Shining Brightly Like A Star. <br><br>Sasuga top idol!</br></br>  <br>I made that chart specially for Miho, so it applies for CG only, and is obviously shopped, but even in regular one, both of them still have their place granted in my Top10.<br><br> This one got kinda obsolete, though </br></br></br>  <br>I don;t eve know what's going on here (i got here through thumbnail on main ) - Who is on the picture ?</br>  <br>name of happy ms meme :^)<br>your welcome</br></br>    <br>Великая Княжна Анастасия Николаевна Романова<br>You're welcome</br></br>  Is there a torrent yet for the latest episode? Just got home from work.  <br>check the usual suspects</br>  <br>where the heck was she packing THOSE?<br> and by THOSE I mean her huge cannons </br></br>  miku a best  <br>repostan</br>    <br> but by that she also had much more focus and characerization than Chieri/Kanako/Rika/Miria who continue to be ignored. <br> continue to be ignored. <br> I'm completely okay with that. All they have to do is stand there and look cute. </br></br></br>  So what's his proposal about? Any ideas?  <br> miss monochrome </br>  <br>My Princess<br>Your welcome</br></br>   wants to focus on marketing overseas <br>Might as well burn the whole building down and kill yourself while you're at it</br>  <br> Wants to increase foreign popularity of 346 idols <br><br>If she only knew...</br></br></br>  <br><br> Wet t-shirt <br> Bubble butt <br>I like this<br><br>I like this a lot</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A man of taste.</br>  <br>I want to say it'll be something akin to the Cinderella Girl election adapted into the anime but.<br>That really doesn't seem like something TakeP would think of nor want.</br></br>  Lil' Anzu butt.  Momoka next week   Kanako's snacks were hidden in the old office   <br> Nana's room <br>The chances are even bigger since it doesn't look like and of the CP girls but NG will be playing any significant roles now.</br></br>  I want P-kun's brother to join him and save the aidorus.  <br> &gt;wants to focus on marketing overseas <br><br>Just do what you are already doing. If I wanted something else I'd watch something else.<br><br><br>Next episode- Someone accidentally plays this song during dance practice and P-kun freaks out<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rye<wbr>EqTbFSv4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Patiently waiting for Momoka and Ichihara</br>   A character's trademark power song is finally performed <br> They insert talking throughout 80% of the song <br><br>I think I now get what Chihayafags felt during her Nemurihime performance.</br></br></br>  <br>God those prefab walls are awful!, I remember spamming those when I was a junior in my firm.</br>    Can we all agree that Mashiro at lest had good intentions and sorta did mostly nothing wrong?<br><br>For some reason, she just wanted to do everything fast instead of doing it slowly but surely.<br><br>I bet it's because  she got close with a certain Producer who was training in America at the time and, before they separated, promised to get their productions and idols overseas and worldwide fame. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't get that feeling.<br>I'm watching a show, not a music video. You can go and listen to the full song whenever you want.</br></br>    <br>Is there actually a link between these in any way?</br>  <br>Holy fuck. What a faggot.</br>  <br>I don't think they know what pedophilia is.</br>  <br>My nigga. Old hags deserve love too.</br>  <br>The fuck? Is the interviewer Brandon Orselli from NG?</br>  <br> Can we all agree that Mashiro at lest had good intentions and sorta did mostly nothing wrong? <br>Right idea, bad execution, she obviously isn't doing it for the misfortune of the idols, but business is business.</br></br>  <br>It made what Kaede was conveying in those scenes a lot more impactful though, especially given the verse they chose to end the song on.</br>  <br>Don't think so.<br><br>P-kun always looks so stoic and stone-faced, much like our Red-Shouldered friend.</br></br></br>  Kirari a cute.  <br> it's borderline pedophilia <br>What</br></br>  <br><br>She is probably under pressure from someone else.</br></br>  <br>Who is best c@ke and why is it KWSM?</br>  <br> waiting for lolis <br> CG anime <br>You better quit now.</br></br></br>   mfw we're never getting closure on this <br>Ah well. Maybe it's better for P-san to not have his wounds reopened.</br>    Dat cute cough Aznu does.  <br>They could have at least drawn the round end of her butt, but I guess she isn't a girl with a smoking figure like Miku who they can give buttshot of.</br>  <br>This.<br>Also Nemurihime was used in a shitty episode in a shitty way.</br></br>    <br><br>Those girls who left him are probably doing JAV now<br><br>Welcome to planet iM@S</br></br></br></br>  What do her pits smell like? I hear east asians lack sweat glands there.  <br>NG Hijack was always a thing, really not surprised this happened.</br>  <br>True. Also, to be fair, she worked from goddamn New York which is all about getting shit done as fast as possible.<br><br>I'm not sure if there's a reason why she wants to do it so quickly but having worked in a busy city like that would at least ingrain some habits to you.<br><br> inb4 she's just putting up a tough front because she needed to do that to survive the world. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For a fraction ofa second I thought they were Utena's shadow play girls, what the fuck.</br>  <br>She is a fucking bitch. No sugarcoating it.</br>  <br>It's like episode 2 and possibly the last time they'd be together as a team. There's actually a reason for them being in the spotlight (actually having a job).</br>  produsah is such a bro  ;-;   What did this say?  <br><br>Translation:<br>I never played this game and all I know about it is from 4chan</br></br></br>  <br> it's like episode 2 <br>And 10 episodes later it will be like episode 12, and still it will be all NG while completely fucking ignoring the majority of other girls, once again.<br>Hell, Kaede already got what most CP girls won't ever.</br></br></br>  <br> dissolve Candy Island it's fucking useless </br>  <br>If they left out the Awakened Miki route in the original game, they'd just have to work around some of the Ami/Mami teasing and there wouldn't be any problems.</br>  <br> It was mostly Kaede being a great girl and BTFO'ing Mishiro <br> lel NG hijack <br><br>Is ANY SCENE where NG makes an appearance now NG a hijack? Jesus people.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't get my hopes up.</br></br>  <br>765pro too stronk.</br>  <br>It's been a while</br>  <br> Child of the President <br> Fairly Young <br> Female <br><br>Being any of those three in a high position already gives a ton of pressure to you, especially in Japanese society. <br><br>There's this sort of need to prove their worth and that they are capable of handling it so they want to do something big with immediate results.<br><br>It's pretty common thing to see in the outside world.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We got Maple<br>We got Koi Kaze<br>We got her telling MishirOujo to GTFO, my fans EGAOs &gt; your shekels and prestige<br><br>BASED/10</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop defending a rigid bitch for fuck's sake, this is anime and I don't care about why she is the ways she is.</br>  <br>Well, that's still 10 episodes later, not the now.<br><br>Have a little faith, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh its "I-can-see-the-fucking-future-and-a<wbr>ll-my-predictions-are-totally-right<wbr>" anon.<br><br>Bout time you posted. Tell me, does Hanako get run over by a dog?</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Calm your tits, son. You'll only see what you want to see and if you want to see one dimensional villians, that's all you'll ever see.</br>  <br> little faith <br>14 episodes were enough to lose the last spark, thank you very much. It's clear who A-1 doesn't fucking care about.<br><br>Be sceptic while you still can.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sheryl </br>  <br>I want to catch Anzu's cold.</br>  <br>What do you think Anzu's panties smell like?</br>  <br>Lighten up, man. Just enjoy the show, the here, and now.</br>  <br>Programme Changes<br>Review Idol appearances<br>-Candy Island- -&gt; other units (rookie appointment)<br>Baseball Dosue (baseball cute) -&gt; Biweekly replacement<br>-&gt; Next Recording end on time<br><br>seems like talk about the game show</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Absolutely revolting.<br>Would suck on.</br></br>  <br>Vinegar.</br>  <br>But my favorite idols didn't do anything in 14 episodes. Hard to enjoy anything like that really, especially when NG takes the screen for the xth time again.</br>  Does anyone have an explanation of kaedes puns in this episode? Translation does a great job of destroying them  <br><br>Thanks</br></br>  <br><br>Such a QT</br></br>  <br>someone ban mio's titties<br>I can't even assess her objectively because of those assets</br></br>    <br>Well, they are the main characters. They had a legit reason for being in the ep. And that's like just for you. Some of us won't even have any of our favorite idols pop-up. That's not even counting all the P-chamas out there.<br><br>This ep distributed screen time jsut fine considering it had to appeal to Kaedefags as well as waste the first act on the Mashiro drama.</br></br></br>  <br>She looks incredibly thick in the in the ones on the left and bottom right.</br>  I want Minami to step on my dick while making this face.  <br>We got cake but no interaction with P-kun.<br><br>Still mad about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Rin seemed especially fascinated with Kaede this episode it looked. I have no doubts that Kaede is going to be involved in Rin drama.</br>  <br>By favorite I mean the favorite among anime cast.<br>For example Miria didn't do half the things or said half the line Kaede just did this episode in 14 episodes.<br>If you don't understand how that can kill a person's hopes, then I don't know what to say.</br></br></br>  Who else is hoping and excited for an Usamin episode next week?  <br><br>If she gets arrested</br></br>  So this means Mio's group is basically confirmed right?  <br>HELL YES</br>  This show needs more delicious Yuko.  <br> More Akane <br>FUCK YES!</br></br>    <br>I'm ready for antics.</br>  <br>I will spoon with her all night long.</br>  Man, seeing segment with the S(mile)ING bgm is a real downer, especially if you've had those kinds of experiences as well where the company you work for had been bought or taken over and there's new management.<br><br>A lot of worry about jobs and stuff.</br></br>  <br>I'm gonna need more scolpolamine for next week.</br>  Back to accurate Russian subs I see.   Daisuki can't handle those barrage of puns <br><br>I don't understand them but I'm still laughing.</br></br>  <br>Does it really look like her room though?</br>  <br>Anya is so lovely</br>  http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XfZ_<wbr>K8sJ6NY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> ＫＯＮＣＨＩＫＩＣＨＩＮ<br><br>ＫＯＮＣＨＩＫＩＣＨＩＮ</br></br> </br></br>  <br>Probably. The pink cutesy decoration, and also Nana has a shot when she's coming out from her apartment in the 2nd Season PV.</br>  <br><br><br><br>It bothers me that she has the same exact name as the Precure character.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A little bit, yes.</br>  <br> Mio's proposal is a school festival event. <br><br>Also,<br> Kaede giving out fans to her fans </br></br></br></br>  <br>Also one on the train. So it's easy to assume they're one after the other which could imply an ep, or at least a scene, of her daily life.</br>  How will Uzuki beat hallucinations and attempted murder?  <br>Wait a sec. Can someone check if this is Mio's room? it sorta looks like it.</br>  <br>What no. <br><br>Mio's room is covered in orange furnishings. Her windows are also clear glass panels.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I wonder if you could molest your loli hallucination.</br></br>  <br>Oh. Oh well. for some reason that cabinet on the left spoke out to me.<br><br>Well, if anything, the rabbit is the most concrete evidence for it being Usamin's room.</br></br></br>  <br>this is my room can confirm</br>  <br>When drama shifts into higher gears, she'll be reduced just repeating ganbarimasu with a dead look in her eyes until she finally breaks</br>  <br>You have to be at least 18 to post on 4chan Usamin.</br>  <br><br>The floor has similar color<br>Dem blue pillows and pinky decoration too<br>There's also that rabbit bag<br><br> Also look at the magazine's date on the card <br> ;_; </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>she's fucking ancient</br>  Just wondering, but none of these signatures are probably cameos or hints at them and are probably the production staff?  <br>Still waiting for that Greenday SR.</br>  <br> If you don't understand how that can kill a person's hopes, then I don't know what to say. <br>I think you're just being a drama queen, anon~<br><br>I'm a Hibikifag, but I enjoyed 2011 regardless of the lack of development for her when that episode finally came around. <br>The key is just being happy for the idols that do get attention and development.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This scene sealed Uzuki's fate for her eventual collapse. There were hints before, but nothing quite solid. However this scene all but confirms those fears.<br><br>Everybody was worried, Mio and Rin were at a loss. Even Uzuki herself didn't know what to do. When put on the spot, Uzuki had the perfect opportunity to say something profound, but what did she do? She regressed to just muttering her catchphrase. And she didn't even say it convincingly this time.<br><br>Here, it's shown that Ganbarimasu isn't Uzuki's weapon, but rather her self-defense mechanism to fall back on when she herself is worried or no longer knows what to do.<br><br>If you take away her ganbarimasu, or point out how hollow it is in front of her, she'll fucking fall apart.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think there's a good chance it's this. I mean, shit like elections and competitions brings out the best (and sometimes the worst) in people.<br><br>It's not a bad idea honestly. It's also in line with what Mashiro wants (someone to spearhead the production).</br></br></br>  <br>SHOOT ME IF YOU DARE SHIMAMURA</br>  <br>Get rid of everyone<br>employ only 142s</br></br>  <br><br><br>This, pretty much. My and probably a number of people's favorite idol aren't even in this anime at all, but that's no deterrent to watch. Being an idolmaster fan ahould man you enjoy spending time with all if not most of the idols. Not just your favorite.</br></br></br>  <br>Uzuki Shimamura<br>An Idoru robbed of her ganbarimasu.</br></br>  <br>I feel like she's most likely to break and attempt to kill Mishiro.<br><br> Like Haruka tried to kill producer. </br></br></br>  Look at that face<br>No fucks given<br>Karen and Nao are sulking, meanwhile Nana who hasn't debuted yet is cheering people up<br>Cinderella Project be mad that they lost super luxury room in super luxury agency<br>Usamin never had any luxury to begin with<br>Renting a small dark apartment <br>Working in maid-cafe to make ends meet<br>Spending all her savings on drugs<br>Nana is poor and struggles in the battle against not only Mishiro, but also herself<br>Usamin's giving it all to maintain self-control and fighting off her delusions<br><br>We've had an episode about top-tier idol, it would be a great change of pace if the next one was about Nana's struggle to make the long awaited Meruhen Debut come true.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  何これ。。。  <br>I thought that was Nao when i saw it. <br>The ML one, that is.</br></br>  <br>Is that Kyoko or ML Nao</br>  So Pinky Cute or Pink Check School?<br><br>Which is the better destiny for UDK?</br></br>  <br><br>It's a little hard to make out, but it says Kyoko Igarashi in English along the bottom of the poster</br></br>  <br>I'd steal that Kaede cardboard cutout in a heartbeat.</br>  <br> Cinderella Project be mad that they lost super luxury room in super luxury agency <br>Not really, the more rational ones were just going with it and even then, these three miracles were as if not more ganbarimasu than even Uzuki.</br></br>    Cute.  Da fuck, did they fire Plum and Mushie?   The JK hookers are sad they'll have to enjo kosai once more.   <br>That artist is wonderful</br>    <br><br>Anya looks nude.<br><br>I'm kinda getting turned on.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like you</br>  I liked their expressions here  God damn it, you said you'd fix this shit for this season.<br><br>Paging Jaka: HorribleSubs, aers, gg, Koda, Daiz a faggot.</br></br>    <br>Someone in staff really likes putting Anya in provocative perspectives.<br><br><br> Russian gets Russian subs <br>I don't see the problem here.</br></br></br></br></br>   You will never shake hands with a cute idol.    mfw imminent blackmail doujins of TakeP being her and the management's bitch so the project would be accepted.   <br>Anya's legs are the best part of the episode.</br>   blu-lay   <br><br>Delicious ROCKU.</br></br>  <br>I shook hands with cute idols  They were 3DPD though </br>  <br>I like how Lanlan is basically a part of LL now</br>  <br><br>LL needs someone to take their sexual frustration out on when the other isn't available, and when isn't that chunni available?</br></br>  <br>Well Anya's her best friend in canon and Nino doesn't have a voice so it only makes sense she'd be with her unit most of the time.</br>  Rika sure had some kind of growth spurt over the last few months.  <br>I would like a Blu-Lay</br>  <br><br> What coming home to your harem of idols is like </br></br>  <br><br>Kanako sure lost some weight there.</br></br>      <br>Now that I think about it, how'd they swipe all the old furniture and the television, and sneak it down into the basement?<br><br>Is that part of the Nomake?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't always get turned on by Chihaya.<br>But when I do.<br>I fap.</br></br></br>  <br>I bet her smiles bring rainbows</br>  <br>They're probably just moving into their own basement confinement quarters.</br>  <br>Nigga, I got two high fives from a qt aidoru.<br><br>Postan Miria.</br></br></br>  <br>The correct reaction from Producer.</br>   Idol series with an already self insert character <br> Still feels the need to insert themselves <br>Scamco at it's finest.</br></br>  <br>They need a villain and the fans will kill them if they make one of the idols the bad guy.</br>  <br> Literally My Taste &gt; Your Taste in idols</br>  <br>I get what you mean.</br>   mfw Kaede will always be a solo idol. <br><br>The path to being a top idol is so lonesome at she got her fans on her back.</br></br>  <br> "No Scamco, YOU are the villain." </br>  <br> "I'm not one of those 765 pansies. I could break an idol in two... with my bare hands." </br>  <br><br>Happy Nao a cute</br></br>  I like to think Mayu lost her shit and racked up a body count after she heard the news so they had to evacuate people to the lower floors.  <br>i want her fluffy hair</br>  <br>It's official, 346Pro is a macrocosm for Scamco with Mishiro being Scamco given flesh. TakeP is a player who refuses to spend money and continues to work hard to train up his idols.</br>  <br> Kaede giving out fans to her fans <br>Fuck I am slow.</br></br>  <br><br>That better be the case. Swear to god man, if Koume leaves before we get a comfy dorm life episode I'm gonna lose my shit.</br></br>   That sad S(mile)ing arrange <br><br>Stay strong Dooky.</br></br>  <br>Will she break him?</br>  <br>This was heartbreaking to watch.</br>  <br>Every player breaks when they realize their Rare+ cards and those occasional event SR+ cards and bad luck will never get them as far as the others</br>  Will Nana be able to protect his smile just like Kaede did?  <br>Nana can't even protect her own smile.</br>  <br>They meet off-screen.<br><br>Both of them are from the EGAO clan.<br>They will protect the EGAOs even if they get fired.<br><br>I believe TakeP is the one who took the picture.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Nanchara~ Nanchara~  <br>Episode when?<br>I want some full focus nanchara and Russian perfection.</br></br>  <br><br>Producer protects the smiles of the idols.<br>Kaede protects the smile of the Producer.</br></br></br>   tfw no Kaede gf   <br>Me on the left</br>  I love Mio.  <br> I have been in this position </br>  Say want you will about Mashiro, but she was dead right about Kaede being in a class above the other idols. She knows talent when she sees it.  <br>Taking VA out of the count, her canon self is really on the same class as the other high-tier CGs with a very attractive design and quirks that create a sense of gap moe.</br>    <br>She has good intentions. She just needs help.</br>  Mishiro needs to make this happen.  <br>Nah, she really is the top cake. Don't deny it.</br>  Cute.  <br>Are there any confirmed M idols in CG?</br>  <br>She's my favorite cake but my subjective sense of opinion stops me from agreeing that she's on a stage above others.</br>  So TakeP's runaway idol are going to make am appearance right before the final arc, right? They're going to attend the Cinderella's Ball and see the result of his renewed efforts, right?<br> I want it so much. </br>  <br> top cake </br>  <br>Wish they would reference more of other productions like 765.<br>I'm curious how the popularity of 346 Pro idols compared to 765 girls.Especially since MishiroD considered the idol project progress was slow.</br></br>    <br><br><br><br>Preach it!<br><br> Anime inverse Kaede is the top idol; proof she doesnt need a unit. She's a one man idol unit and can freely joined in with other unit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>wasn't the joke that she was writing takagaki on maple(kaede) leafs?</br></br>     autism   <br>Kaede's puns work on multiple levels. She's that good.</br>  <br>There's alot of puns some of them were really good too.</br>  <br>I want that "punishment".</br>  <br>She already showed up though.</br>  Which of the two prostitutes are more expensive, Rin or Anya?  <br>Pls /a/ Mika will never betray TakeP; they just got assigned with a different P but their biggest fan is TakeP.</br>  <br>Plum just can't keep her horror DVDs and other spooky paraphernalia in the office anymore.<br>Other girls used boxes for their stuff, Koume just used that instead.</br></br>  I want to drink warm tea from this every morning.  <br>If it was Mika (or Kaede) I think they would have mentioned it by now with all the times they've seen Producer.</br>  <br>Imported shit is always more expensive than the local specialty.</br>  <br>Anya is the furthest from being a prostitute.</br>  <br>Maybe after the ML anime they'll make a three-way crossover special.</br>  <br> warm tea <br>Considering Kaede, it has to be beer or some other alcoholic beverage.</br></br>   Rock   <br>Anya because she's Russian.</br>  <br> green day </br>  <br>You could actually see soemof those fans (particularly the curly haired one) in the audience and the crowd</br>  <br>Kaede truly is best girl, kind of sad they didn't include a stronger scene with the producer. Feels like they shot down all the theories of them knowing each other from before.</br>  I'm still waiting for Karen to pass out eventually.  <br>This scene did a particularly nice job of showing that dynamic.</br>  <br>It's unfortunate that none of them could be any of the canon CG idols, although there is that one CG that had a past as a failed idol but that's not really the same thing as quitting.</br>  <br>You can help make it go faster if you slip something in her drink.</br>  <br>Which one?</br>  <br>That's a first.</br>  <br>Not really; from the looks of some scene Kaede knows TakeP pretty well. Base on her reaction from the scene on the back stage. Made me remember <br>.</br></br>  <br>I think it's Toko Hattori?</br>  Why is Miku so cute when she isn't being a fake cat?  <br>So there is hope... thanks anon. Still even if Kaede somehow manages to score some points, sadly Rin will be there to protect her claim in the P.</br>  <br>The one with the hat?</br>  <br>Hattori Toko, I think. Her thing was that she failed before as an idol.</br>  <br>If you mean this hat, then yes.</br>  <br>Autism doesn't suit her.</br>    <br>Same reason why rock is more adorable when she embraces the fact that she's actually a cute.</br>  <br>I'm just happy they didn't completely shoot it down.<br><br>Half of the fun in CG, not just the anime, is making weird and crazy headcanons anyways.</br></br></br>  <br>Scamco at their finest.</br>  <br>Wow, bad taste</br>  <br>Too bad P belongs to Mayu.</br>  So what are the chances of Mishiro will be the one creating Triad Primus and putting Rin in the forefront of her super duper speshuul snowflake unit?<br><br>It seems like the thing Scamco would do, specially because it'll let them put Rin, once again, in a special forefront place where they can keep shilling her hard.</br></br>  <br> Chieri at the top. <br>You, I like you.</br></br>  I have the feeling they're going to use at least some of this season's episodes to highlight the support characters or their gimmicks like Mayu and Kaede so far, and possibly Nana next, and then we move on to unit stuff like PP, TP, etc.  <br>Bah, don't be delusional. Didn't you see how Kaede protected his smile, she is the only one for him.</br>  <br>True true.<br><br><br>I agree 1/3 of it.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>How cute will Riina be during her arc with Natsuki?</br></br>  <br>There's a good chance of it. It'll also coincide with Rin's arc of having fun and enjoying life and being an idol.<br><br>She'd start forgetting about that and think of the results.</br></br></br>  <br>The entire setup was so Rin could be shilled.<br> All projects are over and Mishiro gets all control on who gets to be with who <br> Karen and Nao just happen to have their debut cancelled <br> Rin quite obviously has been more prominent and active compared to the first cour despite already having an arc about her. <br>The entire anime was made to promote Rin.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I doubt it.<br><br>They didn't even give us Project Fairy in the original iM@S.</br></br></br>  Would we resent the Rin shilling nearly as much if her voice actor had been different? As in a voice actor that could actually sing well from the start.  <br>Actually, now that the main cast of introduce, they're probably going to do just that.<br><br>They're gonna make the main cast interact with the support (new units, Natsuki with Asterisk, etc.)</br></br></br>  <br>Karen and Nao already debuted, it was their CD that was canceled.</br>  <br>People just dislike her because she takes time away from their favorite idol.</br>  <br>A-1 will never redeem themselves ever again if they do that. I like Rin but she pale in comparison to other cool idols.</br>  <br>Nah. It's the favortism that pisses most people off.<br><br>Her VA does her job pretty well and the voice matches well. I also like how her VA really is trying to gitgud at singing and knows she isn't that good.<br><br>It's just the shilling itself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So cute.<br>Also super cute: Miku getting super jealous because her little fucktoy is getting chummy with Natsuki.</br></br>  <br>I wish I was able to spout nonsense with a straight face.<br><br>There will be focus I'm sure, but saying the anime is for Rin is just stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>She should've been more of visual idols.<br>She only got over with the fans initially just because her design.</br></br>  CG covering 765 songs when?   Takagaki-san <br>No really, how do they fuck up this hard?</br>  <br>Probably. The resentment came gradually. Everybody loved Rin initially, even after the Cinderella Master came out. She just sort of stagnated over time, like eating the exact same breakfast everyday for two years.</br>  <br>Can you blame them though? I'm all for Rin's being popular, I can accept and understand that much.<br><br>But when her character actively hurts all the other possible chances all the other idols could have because Scamco does nothing but RIN RIN RIN RIN RIN it's hard to not get bitter. Too much of something, even if it something a person likes, and sooner or later they will get sick of it.</br></br></br>  So if Kaede is the support cast of Dookie/NG; who's Nana supporting?Candy Island?  <br><br>Twilight Sky better be played at least once during her arc, either the song itself or a rendition of it, or we riot.</br></br>  <br>Nana cant even support herself.</br>  <br><br>People on't like her VA?</br></br>  <br> Candy Island <br> Relevant enough to get supported by someone <br>Good joke</br></br></br>  <br>I'd honestly have said Dekoration, but thee's a good chance it'd be Mika.<br><br>It's pretty hard to say, honestly. It could just be a general ep of people coming and going through the cafe.</br></br></br>  <br>But in the anime she's not an established idol yet. She's just working as waitress in the cafe.</br>  <br>The prostitute on the right sure is washed up.</br>  <br><br>A little harsh on Nana.</br></br>  <br>Life is harsh to Nana, and she deserves it.</br>  I just want to hear TakeP sing, is that so much to ask? AkaP got his own songs in one of the cover releases, so TakeP can get one too, right?  <br>Dude stop it; I like Nana but you spouting the truth makes me sad.<br><br><br>Well If Asterisk gets Natsuki; 4 choices are left either CI, RA, LL, Deko; only reason I think CI would be a good combi with her is because of Anzu. She can learn a thing from Nana</br></br></br></br>  What's this about Nana being a complete wreck of a person? Did I miss a new epic meme or something?  <br>I want to get swept up in her misery.</br>  <br>My favorite CG song. It's just so fun and full of energy.</br>  <br>Sounds dangerous. That hag has nothing to lose.</br>  <br>Dude I dont see the problem?</br>    <br>I wonder how much she moves her hips on the couch</br>  <br>I want to share her sadness and be there for her.</br>  <br>So you want Nana to drag you down to her level of personal sadness?</br>  I hope this is a recurring character and everytime he shows up he is always running in exhausted like this.  <br>And it was really good. One of my favorite ones.<br><br>Guy would need a bit more training though.</br></br></br>  <br>If the favoritism is that strong then it's obvious it's to shill Rin</br>  <br><br>I was surprised at how nice of a song it was when I first heard it. Easily one of my favorites. Too bad we'll probably never see it animated.</br></br>  <br>Dude; you got some weird ass taste. The only one that can save Nana is herself. She should just go back home.</br>  <br><br>Not every woman is a prostitute, Anon...</br></br>  <br> Nana died on the way back to her home planet. </br>  <br>Yes<br><br><br>I will go to her home planet with her.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well she is 3D, of course not. As a 2D guy I notice way too many flaws with real women, personally I wouldn't be interested if I met any of the iM@S VAs IRL.</br></br>  Kai deh<br>Kaydee<br>Kay deh<br>Ké dé</br></br></br>  <br>Her VA is great, Rin isn't</br>  <br> What's this about Nana being a complete wreck of a person? Did I miss a new epic meme or something? <br>I'm not even sure where to begin to point you towards, considering pretty much any of the official material involving Nana implies that she absolutely cannot direct her own life for peanuts.</br></br>  <br><br>Her VA listens to anime OSTs while cooking if I recall.</br></br>  <br>You can't be more of a prostitute if you were never a prostitute in the first place<br>Anya a purest</br></br>  <br>Fukuhara is a loveable nerd, she listens to anime OSTs and even cooks anime food, she tries hard to be the kind of voice Scamco is setting for Rin and I like her a lot because of it, it's just too bad I can never bring myself to like Rin.</br>  <br>[citation needed]</br>  <br>He says "Takagaki-kun".<br>The subs say "Takagaki-san".<br>I don't understand how you can screw something like that up.</br></br></br>   fingers crossed for banchou next week   Make your bets.<br><br>Will Mishiro accept the egao proposal or will she keep up with her, while arguably efficient, no fun allowed ways?</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>I'll say she accepts but uses it as a "it had better work or you're fucked" card. Or she'll reject it and separate NG.</br>  <br><br>Same here, I really want to see her animated</br></br>  <br>It's way too early for her to do ANYTHING remotely positive.<br><br>Even if she's technically right, she's being a dick about it which is the biggest problem.<br><br>She's not gonna have a change of mind any time soon because that would erase all the conflict and drama and we all know that's a no-no.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How can you refuse a proposal named "Power of Smile"?<br>Give that man a nobel prize already.</br></br>  <br>She will probably show up in a later episode if she does speak, because of anime production schedules and how recently she got a voice.</br>  <br>At the expense of TakeP's career.</br>  <br>Definitely not going to happen</br>  So cute  <br>Usually I never care about what people think in canon but in this case I find it incredibly hard to believe that Love Laika isn't some ultimate idol unit that Mishiro only cared about NG last episode, everything about them is great.</br>  <br>We actually see her be in a bit of a pickle because the first step of her plan didn't push through,<br><br>I'd say there's a higher chance of her accepting it but there's a still a reasonable chance of ehr not accepting it.</br></br></br>  WHY DOES SHE REFER ONLY TO NEW GENERATIONS<br><br>THERE ARE 4 MORE FUCKING UNITS IN THERE<br><br>ADDRESS THEM ALL OR DON'T FUCKING DO IT<br><br>WHAT'S EVEN THE POINT OF THIS SCENE? JUST TO SHOVE NEW GENERATIONS ON OUR FACES EVEN MORE THAN IT ALREADY IS?<br><br>I THOUGHT THIS WAS IDOLMASTER, I DON'T REMEMBER THE DAMN ANIME BEING CALLED NEW GENERATIONS<br><br>I'M FUCKING TIRED OF THIS SHIT SCAMCO<br><br>FUCK YOU</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Which pickle?<br><br>She told off TakeP it even hurt to look at.<br><br>Her reaction to Kaede's refusal was practically "Your loss"<br><br>All I'm expecting her to do about the egao project is to rip it in front of TakeP face while cherrypicking it hard in front of everyone to humiliate and make an example of him.<br><br>She's gonna keep at it stubbornly because she's the alpha queen and things must be done as she says because she says so.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Though I didn't get as mad as you, I agree.</br>  <br>Come on now. There has only been one unit this entire time, anon. And that's New Generation.</br>  <br>Even ensemble shows have main characters. If you don't want NG to get the lion's share of the limelight might as well drop the show.</br>  <br> WHAT'S EVEN THE POINT OF THIS SCENE? JUST TO SHOVE NEW GENERATIONS ON OUR FACES EVEN MORE THAN IT ALREADY IS? <br>Welcome to Cinderella Girls</br></br>  <br>See you next week.</br>  <br>To show that she has the capacity to learn the various units and the members that constitute them, but would still rather opt for the efficiency of starting everything from scratch.<br>Also to foreshadow that she does like to play favorites, like she did with Kaede this episode.</br></br>  <br>Why is it that even 2D Nips have shit taste?</br>  <br>I dunnow. She was looking over some stuff and said she didn't really have time for him. I'm not sure if the productions even has anyone left of Kaede's caliber.<br><br>She could just be acting tough. When someone says no to you, some people do that.</br></br></br>   no scene where the girls had to wash cum off their hands during the handshake part   <br> Also to foreshadow that she does like to play favorites, like she did with Kaede this episode. <br>Except that's not playing favorites?<br><br>Kaede is an actually recognized and famous idol, that she can considered for being the front for Mishiro's new project because of the fame she has gotten through her hard work.<br><br>Playing favorites would be picking Rin when she's practically a newbie idol as the new front for no particular reason at all.<br><br>Say all you want, but her picking Kaede was a decision made seemingly on merits, not favoritism.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's probably gonna pull the "I see great potential in you Rin, you remind me of myself" card.</br>  We need side OVAs<br><br>ML can wait</br></br>  <br><br>But I want my weeb animated.</br></br>  Daily reminder that Kaede got more and better characterization than half of the "main girls" in just one episode.  http://cgtranslation.blogspot.kr/20<wbr>15/07/idol-mster-cinderella-girls-n<wbr>o-make-ep.html<br><br> Chieri's song puts everyone except Anzu to sleep <br> Producer asserts his position as Anzu's boss <br><br>hnnnng</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br>They did this shit in the NG manga too, so they had better not.<br><br><br>What do you expect? The anime doesn't even try to hide that favoritism is what guides how it goes and Kaede is really popular.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Anzu: Haa... Producer, look at their sleeping faces. <br> Producer: N, No. That's...! <br> Anzu: I didn't mean that you should devour them with your eyes. Look, they are all smiling. <br> Producer: ... </br></br></br></br>  <br>What photo was he looking at?</br>  <br> Chieri: Anzuki, we have some time now. Let's do it. <br> Anzuki <br> A being that never gives up on giving up on work <br>How frightening.</br></br></br></br>  Was there even a Magic Hour this week or did they stop that?  <br>NG isn't favoritism, it's the fact that they are the main trio. Get used to it because you are going to have a shit ton of Rin and Uzuki shoved into your face these next episodes.</br>  <br>We know that Kaede isn't the only idol at 346 that has high merits though, which calls into question why she chose Kaede in particular when the other members of Happy Princess could have qualified such as KWSM or Mika.<br><br>She even said that she "chose" Kaede herself, as if it weren't something that was a merit-based guarantee.</br></br></br>  <br>That was also the "one item" that Uzuki brought to the office.<br><br>Dooky forever healing TakeP.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Will we see TakeP crying? He looked really out of it at one point.</br></br>  <br>We got a Magihour for Koume and Karin's cameo last week.<br><br>http://cgtranslation.blogspot.kr/20<wbr>15/07/idol-mster-cinderella-girls-m<wbr>agic-hour_23.html<br><br>Maybe we'll get a Magihour for Sanae and Miyako too? That'd require Miyako to actually have a voice though.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Does Bamco digitally distribute every Song? why does Uz still buy CDs?</br>  <br>But Magihour should have been out by now if there was one this week.</br>  <br> NG isn't favoritism, it's the fact that they are the main trio <br>It is though? If it were because of that then they would be treated the same way as the 765Pro main trio, because unlike with the 2011 anime, everything didn't revolve around Miki, Chihaya and Haruka, they just got big drama.</br></br>  <br>Yes there was. It's Miho Haruna Yuko. Sorry don't have a pic.</br>  <br>I wish Uzuki was shoved to my face</br>  <br>I don't believe we will. His suffering episodes have already passed, so now he needs to be the resolute pillar to support his idols.</br>  Kaede's voice is so soothing it heals me  <br>truth<br><br><br>also truth</br></br></br></br>  <br>That was just luck of the draw then. We can say all of them were in equal capacity for the role Mishiro wanted but she ended up being the one.<br><br>Favoritism implies someone is chosen over another person who's more qualified for the job despite being not as qualified as the not choosen person and while we can't say for certain if there's a more qualified idol than Kaede in 346 it's no surprise she was considered for, and ultimately been the one who was offered the position she refused. Whatever the reason it was, I do not believe it was because of something like favoritism, Mishiro doesn't know anyone on the office. She's a hard logic and fact woman.</br></br></br>  <br>Triple dubs confirm Kaede is best idol</br>  <br>he will be crying once the cakes are done with him</br>  <br>The way the anime is set up, they're kind of the main protagonists of the story, with Producer also being main protagonist. How they're set up is different, where we have Rin who's learning the joys of being an idol and Uzuki who's been shown as good and pure character, but possibly not fit to be an idol. The anime is kind of set up to be their story and growth as idols, as well as Producer's own evolution as a character.</br>  <br>Then why would they say it like it was the story of growth for the Cinderella Project then? So far there has been little growth for the Project and more on Mio and Rin.</br>  <br><br>A-1 didn't deliver shit so much as they got their head out of their asses for at least an episode. It's been known to happen on occasion.</br></br>  <br><br>Cast just struggling to stay on model in that frame.</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oWz<wbr>Ov3-tG1A</wbr>  [ ]<br>Karen a cute. When will she let her hair down?</br>  <br>I thought Nao being so awkward this episode was more endearing.</br>  <br><br>Well it is Hayamin so that's kind of to be expected</br></br>  <br> When will she let her hair down? <br>Anon she's a Cinderella Girl not a Rapunzel Girl</br></br>  <br>Growth is a very broad term (the bastards). Practically all of the girls had grown as characters in one sense or another, be it the development of new relationships that didn't exist prior, exploration of unseen character facets, or just a simple "before and after" type of deal.<br>The NoMakes also have a particular focus on character growth, but most people tend to discount it as not being part of the story even thought they're typically very relevant.</br></br>  KOKORO KAZE NI TOKASHI NAGARA<br>SHINJITEIRU MIRAI NI TSUNAGATTEYUKU</br>  <br>TakeP aint no newbie to singing.<br><br>The guy sings fucking gondola songs.</br></br></br>  <br> The NoMakes also have a particular focus on character growth, but most people tend to discount it as not being part of the story even thought they're typically very relevant. <br>That's were my main beef comes from that they use the NOMAKE as an excuse to never develop the girls in favor of shitty drama and character focus on just NG, and it's because of that I always feel the 2011 anime was better in most regards, they were given a second chance to not repeat the same mistake and they only made it worse.</br></br>  <br> green and blue glowsticks <br>How fucking kawaii.</br></br>  <br>Hayamin is fucking amazing.</br>  <br><br>She's a goddess among seiyuu.<br>Her presence alone makes CG &gt; ML.<br>Too bad we weren't getting her duet with Mingosu on the 10th anniversary concert.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's like your opinion, man.</br>  <br>I like to hope realistically.<br>Like a trio with Hayamin, Sumipe and Maaya Uchida</br></br>  <br>Yup, kinda unfortunate that most of the best scenes of the cast (Save for NG) happened in the nomakes. Thank god we have that dude willing to translate them because otherwise I'd be pretty disappointed with the anime.</br>  <br> Watched CG today, received idol Hayami and Koi Kaze <br> Realize someone subbed the Dandelion episode, receive schoolgirl Hayami <br><br>Today is a good day.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I always get depressed when I listen to Saori Hayami because she's my same age and has accomplished more than I will probably ever do in my entire life.<br><br>It's even worse when it is a younger seiyuu, specially Nao Toyama after I started to like her.</br></br></br>  <br>Rin blocking TakeP from wet t-shirts was great</br>  Anya makes the best faces  <br>you mean sideS</br>  <br>Da.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Fukuhara is a real life Dookie, while her singing is not great and she's a complete newbie, but she finally bit it big and she puts in the Gambarimasu that Rin doesn't</br></br></br></br>  Secondaries, what's your opinion on Kaede now that you've finally gotten a taste of her?<br><br>Have you converted to a cake lover or not after today's episode?</br></br>  <br><br><br> TakeP singing powerballads dad-rock and/or enka <br>why do I want this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then what does that make Ohashi?</br>  <br>I liked her based on her design before but watching the episode I can see that she's a living marshmallow.</br>  <br>A dork, while NG themselves are a bunch of boring sluts, their VA are great.</br>  Can someone post that comic where Rika is offering to be P-san girlfriend and P-san gives her a look of "really?"  <br>like a voice carried by the wind<br>https://<span>youtu.be/xox-Fzr4i1A  [ ]</br></br>  <br> I can see that she's a living marshmallow. <br>Is that a compliment?</br></br>  <br> pic <br>I-I don't get it.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I mean she's super soft and sweet.</br>  Monday can't come fast enough.<br><br>I need Usamin confirmation.</br></br>  <br>Some artists like drawing characters as baby chicks.</br>  <br>God fucking damn.</br>  <br>Is that nasheed?</br>  <br>Please respond.</br>    $50 says Kaede figure will be announced at Wonfes today. Would not be surprised if they had this planned out with this episode.  <br>Cute Russian gets headpats</br>  <br>Shes a fucking dork. Plays some bitchin drums though.<br><br>But she does have alot of similarities with Uzuki.<br><br>- Both share the same hometown<br>- Both attended art schools in their younger years<br>- Both entered a big audition only to fail, but ended up being impressionable enough that the judges picked them as special candidates<br>- Both made their grand debut at age 17<br>- Both were quoted saying that their greatest asset is their smile.<br><br>That said Ohashi is alot more wacky than Uzuki. Dooky tends to be more elegant that people end up surprised by Ohashi when shes in her Uzuki-mode. Both are equally ditzy though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Rika <br>You meant Mika?</br></br>  <br><br>Not to mention she prided herself for reading SAO before it got popular. Also her smile is so radiant.</br></br>  <br>I think she has a cool design, i did expected more puns.</br>  <br>Mio is pretty much 2D Meshiya though.<br>Sans the unhealthy fascination with little boys and slimes.<br>The two of which are not necessarily correlated to one another.<br><br>She even has the same history of not being able to stand out as a VA idol in her early years despite heavy efforts at pushing her group by production company.<br>I also heard that it was her own idea to give Mio's her weird voice inflections.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The absolute fucking best idol.  I want to have sex with her.  <br> Subs did not even try to make up a half-decent even if inaccurate pun <br>Why is this allowed?</br></br>  <br>Was there ever any doubt?</br>  Except fans for fans i don't get the other puns, i notice there are a lot but i don't understand  <br> slimes <br>Fucking what?</br></br>    <br>God, those earring are so hideous.<br><br>Why couldn't she just have just simple hoop rings or something more elegant instead of trashy fake emeralds?</br></br></br>  Mishiro-san did NOTHING WRONG.  <br>But she ain't doing anything right either.</br>  <br>She has a great idea.<br>But bad execution.</br></br>  <br>She has a great idea but bad execution.</br>  <br><br><br> She has a great idea. <br><br>Giving herself executive power to choose which idols to promote is not a very good idea.<br><br>Nice mirror dubs, tho.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Go, fuck yourself. <br><br>Best girl.</br></br>  <br><br><br> Let's pile all our resources in one basket and hope nothing wrong ever happens to it while also giving all the new blood no opportunities to grow at all <br>How is this a good idea exactly? Does she think those popular idols will stay young forever OR remain popular forever? Her aims are awfully short-sighted.</br></br></br></br>  <br> But she ain't doing anything right either. <br> How is this a good idea exactly? <br>I never said anything of the sort, but she's got a pretty realistic view on being a celebrity, fortunately this is 2D, where hags can pretend to be 17 all they want without any trouble.</br></br></br>  Haha, time for whisky and tequila. <br><br>Well time to visit my local Dan Murphys.</br></br>  <br>What I'm meant was she has great idea on increasing the idol popularity in overseas but she has a bad execution on disband all the idol division.</br>  <br> hags can pretend to be 17 all they want </br>  <br>Well she is a no nonsense woman with a strong attention to detail and daughter of the corporation's President.</br>  <br>Also, someone who has no fucking idea how the Japanese system works considering she's trying to bring to western model to it.<br><br>She has her heart in the right place, kinda, but she's going full retard about it.</br></br></br>   Daga kotowaru! <br>You're killing me here, pixiv!</br>  <br>I want to drag Kaede to my bed</br>  I want to hug Mishiro and tell her everything will be okay and I'll protect her from all the bullies trying to stop her to make the company better.  <br>I want to bully her.</br>   15 more until it reached image limit  <br>can we have nice discussion without image dump, so we can reach bump limit</br>  <br>What would you like to talk about?</br>  <br>Do you think Chihaya and Kaede would get along?</br>  <br>I like Iori.</br>  <br>only if Chihaya grew to enjoy puns</br>  <br>No. She too easy of bait for flat puns.</br>  <br>Of course. Kaede is basically a fusion of Azusa and Takane.<br><br><br>Chihaya canonically loves puns. Even in the special anime when AkaP makes the "Sleeping Beauty" pun about Miki.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay then, why do some CG idols look horrible in their 'work' getup but look great in normal/idol getup? Stewardess and nurse might be the biggest offender. Milky Holmes also looks silly.</br>  <br>She would probably laugh like an idiot at her shitty puns. Doubly so if Kaede somehow managed to get her drunk.</br>  Riina's pretty fucking cute. <br><br>Natsuki mentoring when?</br></br>  Why does Kaede like puns?  <br>She abandoned the EGAOs and the 2 confirmed EGAO monster didnt want to protect her smile. Maybe when she can finally smile. TakePXKaede will protect her smile. She might even propose to TakeP to go to Murica to studying with AkaP.

Smith has been a succubus this entire time, constantly manipulating darling and his guests, the more love and lustful aura that builds in the house, the more powerful she becomes. <br> At the end of the series, Ms. Smith finally reveals her true form and casts a spell on darling <br> Darling is split into 7 copies of himself so each monster girl gets her own husband and won't have to share <br> these copies refer to each other as brothers <br> these events lead up to Okaydo's original "living with "series. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Best ending, only people mad would be the fags who want ONLY their girl to win</br>  <br>Holy fuck, an ending that total bullshit.<br><br>And I believe it.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably one of the best parts.</br>  <br>oh it will be, and like Miia's shedding it will be in an OVA or on the blueray's.<br><br>or just censored like this part was and only shown in full on the bluray's</br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't one of the brothers with the Minotaur girl?

Younger(teens-30), would be into Miia, some Rachnee as well(but moreso than the over 30s).<br><br>So far, the results seem to say my theory is pretty sound.</br></br> <br><br> The way I see it, Cerea appeals to older guys who are content with an occasional roll in the hay, plenty of soft romance, especially   hand-holding , while the younger crowd are more into the idea of prolonged/large amounts of sex/orgies, and/or femdom which Each and Miia represent.<br><br>So what do you guys think?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think most of them would be okay with that</br>  <br>Its segways into introducing Rachnee so theres very little chance of it being OVAd</br>  <br><br>Literally the dumbest idea ever proposed.</br></br>  <br>Female birds are maternal as fuck dude, what are you on?</br>  <br>Beastiality</br>  <br>Official monster girl cuddling power levels<br><br>1.

That's not why Miia is my waifu are you fucking shitting me right now.</br></br>  <br><br>So what you're saying is,  if I fuck her doggy and she keeps moving forward, her brain will reset constantly so it's like she's getting fucked for the first time? </br></br>  <br>This is so wrong, just fuck off</br>  <br>You have it all backwards anon. All of it.</br>  <br><br><br>it worked for Maburaho.</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly I just want to cuddle with Miia, the sex is a bonus.</br>  <br> segway </br>  <br>I don't know about older guys preferring Cerea, but you got the teens preferring Miia right.</br>  <br> Maburaho  <br>Now that's a name I've not heard for a long time.

I was actually more curious about how their personalities speak to different age groups.

I'm the 2nd Riasfag/the dunkfag. I haven't made any requests in the WWDs since my original post saying I wouldn't make Rias requests any time soon, since the dunkfag collage was still oncoming and apparently she'd be in that (and out of not wanting to cause stress for the original Riasfag).<br><br>I haven't left the threads, I just haven't been requesting Rias either since there's a delivery coming and I was told it's bad form to continue to request when you have one on the way.<br><br>Other than that I've just mainly been e-mailing with the other dunkfags in our e-mail group. <br><br>Speaking of which, if Cyanbro is still around: I believe your request for her in a dunk tank is still in the works somewhere, though no estimate there timewise. I know another request someone made for Yukari from Persona 3 is already pretty far into progress as well, though I don't believe that requester is on the mailing list yet. And the collage itself is looking like roughly 2 1/2 months out, barring any artist delays.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> being a dunkfag </br>  <br>Fuck off already, shithead. Nobody wants you here.</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>Riasbro has enough shit to deal with here without you showing up again</br>  Requesting *Hyun-ae wearing sarong  <br> again <br><br>Never left, but I already said I'm not going to be countering his requests or requesting her for a long while. Riasfag #1 can request all he wants.</br></br></br>  <br>Note: "showing up" again</br>  requesting mochi singing or anything cute please!  <br>Wew.</br>  has the dunkfags been here for a long time or is it a recent development?  <br>Dunk shit uses to be forced into /d/ or /h/ until they got kicked out, now they just shit up /a/ drawthreads.</br>  <br>Long time, the posts go back to 2012 and before on the archives for /a/.

I turned off the jpeg artifact reduction to attempt to save those details.</br>  <br>this Album is also really good.<br><br>Fetishism Ark (remix) is the best track</br></br></br>  <br>I was listening to that earlier, Desire Blue Sky is my favorite, enough so to make an osu map of it.</br>  <br><br>Are you the one that made that map? I found out about that song through that map, though the map claimed it was from a different song.</br></br>  <br>Desire Blue Sky is probably the biggest improvement with the remix.

Probably just the standard flan or vanilla.</br>  HAPPY BIRTHDAY     Kurisu is younger than me <br><br>What a terrible feeling.</br></br>  <br>Depends on how much, she's two years younger than me. Perfect age gap for a healthy happy couple.</br>  <br><br> Kurisu is older than me <br><br>I'm not sure how to feel about this.

Guts' party needs another DPS</br>  <br>Raksas transforms into his apostle form and kills two tapasa. Silat and Rickert run away.</br>  I'll post this in every berserk thread until you like it!  <br>FUCK</br>  <br>Griffith don't you have a kingdom to run or something</br>  <br>MODS</br>  <br><br><br>You'll like it eventually, anons.</br></br></br>  <br>Griffith x  Castle  OTP</br>  <br>Shit cunts should just learn Korean</br>    <br>Wait wait wait.....<br><br>Why are there korean translations available but no fucking Japanese raws?</br></br></br>  <br>the green hair?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128544980 <br> 3 months <br><br>try 1.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128544980 <br>Next issue is Aug 28</br>  <br>Yep that's right!</br>  english translated when?  <br>It's so weird, everyone else has normal=ish features, but she comes in with green hair. Maybe it's to accentuate her witchiness</br>    <br>I prefer her with a more reasonable hair color.</br>  <br>Skull knight, the previous user of the armor probably faced the godhand with it and they look fine.</br>  <br>well Griffith was the only motherfucker to have white hair</br>  I want to fuck Puck.   Elf king restore Guts physical condition to his tip top shape. <br><br>This is really going to happen, isn't it?</br></br>  <br>I don't think elves have genitals, anon.</br>  TRANSLATION FUCKING WHEN  <br> implying <br><br> Are you a ant too! </br></br></br>  <br>So what he'll still get shit on by any Godhand.</br>  Just read Vol. 34 - this was the most glorious shit I've ever seen. All of it was worth it for that.  i came on /a/ looking for this berserk thread<br>english fucking when ;_;</br>  <br>that whole battle was absolutely incredible, every single panel was a masterpiece</br>  <br>My mouth was agape the whole time - from this page until the end of the volume - and my jaw only ever dropped further. <br><br>If I wanted to own one volume of Berserk, I think it might be this one.</br></br></br>  <br>DESERVE A BAN</br>  <br>LEARN TO LOVE IT</br>  So even when we do get a new chapter, it takes fucking forever to get translated. God damn it.  <br>I can't hate griffith.</br>    <br>I can't hate new Griffith, but I can be bored by him.<br><br>Though, I haven't gotten to read any exposition from him yet. So maybe he'll become less boring.</br></br></br>  <br> killed all his friends </br>  <br>Don't get me wrong, I hate Griffith with every fiber of my being, but he didn't consider them his friends but rather comrades and stepping stones to his own kingdom.</br>  Hey BOYS a few days ago I uploaded they first few pages of 338 translated off someone here on /a/ but he stopped before finishing the translation.<br>I did my best to complete it based on a summary I found and a Korean friend I have on steam.<br>Its probably all wrong, but here it is. 388 translated.<br>http://imgur.com/a/K8IXE</br></br></br>  <br>Are you that guy that wanted to know if humans ever fuck up any monsters?</br>  So what are the odds that Guts and Caska, both being branded, is gonna fuck with the Elfheim protection?  <br> Implying the next member of the JRPG band won't be Silat </br>  <br>haha<br> are there any legit korean speakers here? </br></br>  <br>Griffith is basically medieval reinhard.</br>  <br>The Koreans fucking pirate everything, so they have no reservations about putting everything on the internet as soon as they get it, unlike the Japanese</br>  <br>If I wasn't such a lazy shit that let my Korean slip I might qualify, but as with everything in my life, I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you anon</br>  <br> Griffith is basically medieval reinhard. <br><br>No where close.</br></br></br>  <br>I only speak north korean</br>  <br>Is Isma already in it?</br>  <br>Yes, she joined up in the last couple of chapters.</br>  Falconia is a sacrificial site for demons...  <br>Griffith is already on the top, what does he gain from more sacrifices?</br>  <br>Becoming an elder god. He went from Jesus to god and all that's left is elder status.</br>  <br>i love you</br>   Rickart dealing with the fact he just slapped Griffith the entire chapter. <br><br>For years people have been asking for Guts to get off the boat, so can we please get him off the fucking boat?</br></br>  <br>Griffith? I say fuck you punk, Rape my girl and shit, is all junk.</br>    <br> Jesus to God <br> not knowing the Holy Trinity <br>enjoy hell faggot<br>Griffith did nothing wrong</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm tired of motherfucking griffith, Raping my gal while i'm chilling in the shack and showing it in my face and for what?</br>  <br>Aren't we getting a new chapter with a hundred pages soon like first? If so then that may be when Guts gets off the boat.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12855175 <br>Fucking nips and their noble ways</br>  <br>The hundred pages was refresher</br>  <br><br>The holy trinity?<br><br>Santa<br>Jesus<br>Ronald Reagan</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ronald Reagan </br>   Rickert repairs a firefighting machine <br><br>This is called Chekov's Gun. There's gonna be a fire/disaster in Falconia and they're gonna need those things.</br></br>  Whatever happened to<br> *sniff* thank you Griffith, thank you for raping me </br>  When was the last time we saw Zodd? He's not in Falconia.<br><br>Prediction: He's leading the assault on Elf Island.</br></br>  <br> Griffith is already on the top, what does he gain from more sacrifices? <br><br>Strong hints and shit say Griffith = Anti-Christ and that he and/or God Hand want to bring about the end of the world.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This shit is WAY more interesting than anything that has been happening on the boat. I sped through Sea God arc and was bored by it all. No drama and it has no bearing on the over all plot. Falconia stuff is great. We're seeing Silat play a major role in the story for once, Rickert is in danger, and Rashkas is gonna fuck things up.</br></br>  <br>Sea God was character development (JRPG party leveling up) and posed more questions about The Boy. <br><br>It was satisfying for me.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The main conflict was Mermaid girl, the Island and the fight with Sea God. I cared for none of it. It wasn't very good horror, and the interactions between Isidro and Mermaid girl were boring. Whole thing felt like filler or padding out the story and isn't needed.</br></br>  When was the last time someone was raped?  <br>When did this last hiatus start</br>  <br>One whole year of no Berserk is rape.</br>  <br> wanting anyone else in Guts party to suffer as the band did </br>  <br>This is a popular misconception. The Devil doesn't want to bring the end of the world. In fact, he is against it.</br>  Griffith wants to be the hero of his own story so much, it's cute. I hope he kills Guts and that scheming sandnigger so he can happily lead his big family to peace and prosperity.  Berserk Saga part 2 when?<br>Even though they fucked up a few things in the Golden Arc I want the Black Swordsman arc animated</br>  <br>It just came out today. I'm impressed someone gave a huge fuck and uploaded ASAP.<br><br>I don't mind waiting for a new chapter.  I'm slightly behind anyways </br></br></br>   new Berserk chapter <br> new Farmland Saga chapter <br>Oh i love this</br></br>  <br><br>Movies bombed HARD. We're never gonna get more. They may have not broken even.</br></br>  <br>Disagree. You could say the same about most of Enoch.</br>  <br> Reincarnation of evil <br> Happy ending </br></br>  <br>Why can't a competent animation studio just pick up from where the TV show left off and keep doing its thing? I want out of the Golden Age.</br>  <br>Maybe one day after the manga ends.<br> Hahahahahahah. </br></br>  <br>Why is she so fucking cute? I can't stand it.</br>  <br>It was truly magnificent. Seeinjg the humans working together with the apostles was really something special, and it'll be really hard to see that stuff happening again in such a massive scale. It was also the conflict where Irvine showed his apostle form for the first time, which was awesome.</br>  <br>Ok, I don't get why literally everyone on /a/, or in fact even in my real life friends say Berserk is godly.<br><br>At first I though it was it was created a long time ago, thus human minds automatically think "Old but Gold", but then I started hearing more and more about it and I began reading.<br><br>I honestly on't see the appeal, like help me out here. I think it's just an edgelord manga with things not for the faint of heart thus 4chan likes it. I can't see passed the yelling, raging and bullshit that goes on, easily avoidable situations plays out so stupidly. Is there something i'm missing? Aside from that the art is just glorious, I feel that's the only main appeal to this edgelord manga</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The next time we'll see squads of human soldiers and apostles fighting together in formation is when Guts storms Falconia for whatever reason.<br><br>Hawk Lancers riding tamed griffons with a flying apostle captain, backed up by human archers and perhaps a sorcerer or two calling the spirits of the fallen to attack directly or possess footsoldiers to empower them. Shit's gonna be legendary.</br></br></br>  <br>We haven't seen necromancers yet have we?</br>  <br>Guts was doing the hot apostle that killed Corkus in the very first chapter.<br><br>Which begs the question: which apostle or astral creature in this series would you want to make your monster waifu?<br><br>Personally I wouldn't mind making the pseudo harpy with owl eyes for tits apostle my monstergirl waifu.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isma is important. Next party member and waifu.<br><br>I have to imagine the next time we see Guts, they are getting off the boat.</br></br></br>  <br>I just want to see Apostles get fucked up. Especially the ones that took Guts' arm and eye. <br><br>I also really want to know what more of the sane apostles sacrificed. I consider Ganishka a sane one. He sacrificed a human and was the most powerful one to date, could the others have sacrificed something not human like the egg?</br></br></br>  Why are all male anime protagonists virgins?  <br>so the nerds that watch it can self-insert more easily.</br>  <br> male haremshit protagonists <br><br>ftfy</br></br></br>    What's the point of being a protagonist if you can't offer your virginity to a worthy partner?  <br>being raped by a man != losing your virginity</br>  Only virgins get magic powers-  <br>What's more important for a self insert fantasy, that the MC is a virgin, or that the girls are all virgins?</br>  <br>He fucked Casca.</br>    <br>It only works when both are.</br>  Well that took an unexpected turn.   It made me feel so empty inside    <br>I wonder when they will turn on each other from being cooped up together too long?</br>  <br>    It made me feel so empty inside  <br>Maybe you should eat something.</br></br>  <br>Never! They're cute girls. The most that will happen is a light verbal fight.  Unless Rii's sister dies. </br>  <br> Maybe you should eat something. <br><br> Take a cue from Megu-Nee </br></br></br>  MIKI A BEST  <br>   Unless Rii's sister dies. <br>I've got some bad news for you</br></br>  <br>They arn't as far as the story is now. They lean on each other for support with Yuki pretty much being the center though she had a mental breakdown a while back and is hanging on by a thread. They say her smile keeps them going but I bet seeing her like that in a self induced delusion is really weighing them down.<br><br> Rii is now in the same boat and Yuki with having delusions. Yuki seems to have come back to reality to a degree but is still talking to Megu-nee. </br></br></br>  <br>I'm well aware of the situation. Raws when?</br>  <br>They have Megu-nee to keep the group unity she is a responsible adult who will keep them out of trouble and sane.</br>  <br>Kurumi turns Miki on, if you catch my drift.</br>  <br>You lost me.</br>  I'm loving the adaptation so far I think it was brave of the production staff to change from the source manga and keep the dog and most importantly Megu-nee alive in the anime version.  <br>   Yuki seems to have come back to reality to a degree but is still talking to Megu-nee. <br><br>What? Are you talking about when she pretended to ask her about the van so Rii wouldn't look totally insane?</br></br></br>  <br>That's fairly lewd, I think. What's the belt thing?</br>  <br>Is this some sort of pasta now?</br>  <br><br><br><br>The anime is written by the author, so he's just putting stuff in he couldn't before, and change things he thought could have been better</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's called a garter belt it keeps stockings up <br><br>Geez are you 5 or something have you never walked in on your mom getting dressed when you were little?</br></br></br>  <br> Not knowing what a garter belt looks like </br>  <br>Yeah. I don't think she's fully recovered and Kurumi may end up showing symptoms of zombifying again like the pilot did, she may fully lose it.</br>  <br>How do you not know what a garter belt is</br>  <br>The whole point of that scene was that she was as bemused as everyone else at Rii bringing her up, and had to awkwardly cover for her. She's definitely not still pretending Megu-nee is there.</br>  Why do Yuki and Miki get the most paired fanart?  <br>you are giving her far too much credit, she is literally retarded she doesn't have that high of a emotional IQ</br>  <br> most importantly Megu-nee alive in the anime version. <br>  all that foreshadowing <br>  the fucking basement scene <br>Anon...</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because of chapter 16, and the fact that they're the ones with the senpai/kouhai relationship.</br>  <br>Because they're opposites</br>  I'm guessing this anime will end at "graduation" ceremony but since there is only a chapter of the manga a month I doubt there will be enough material for a season 2 a year from now.  <br>  and change things he thought could have been better <br>The roof scene was god-tier, a really nice touch and gives more sense to the story line that the manga didn't do</br></br>  <br>I don't think we are, she doesn't even think of asking Megu-nee until Rii and Kurumi bring it up. She also looks flustered and has a sweat drop. She's faking it.</br>  <br>I hope he really gets a chance to redeem the errors of the manga in the mall flashback next week and in the helicopter crash</br>  <br> I hope he really gets a chance to redeem the errors of the manga in the mall flashback next week and in the helicopter crash <br>You keep saying it, both those scenes were fine. It's clear what happened in both of them.</br></br>  <br>What errors?</br>  <br>Oh look, this idiot again.<br><br>I guess it's a good thing for the mangaka that this series is popular enough to have its own dedicated trolls.</br></br></br>  Reminder that Miki will not lose  <br>Anyone who didn't understand the pilot thing was retarded.</br>  <br><br><br>I don't wear a belt under my clothing to keep my underwear up, nor am I female. I've learned something today.</br></br></br>  <br> implying Megu-nee and the dog are alive. </br>  <br/>  <br>The helicopter scene in particular was a done horribly, it crashed then exploded in the court yard and yet in the next pages we see the rooftop crops have burned, I had to go back and reread it to see if I missed a scene where some flaming debris fell on the roof during the crash or something. <br><br><br>The megu-nee alive anon is the only troll in these threads I'm a critic who is expressing my opinions feel free to hide my posts but please keep the personal insults to yourself friend.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>See<br><br>It's not the pilot it's how magically a fire can crawl across a courtyard and make it's way up 3 stories onto a rooftop</br></br></br></br>  I enjoyed the manga more so far, but we only have three episodes, and I did marathon the manga, so I'm a bit bias. Still looking forward to the show week to week. Interested to see what changes/gets jumbled around.<br><br>  What the Fuck are they doing with that dog? </br></br>   &gt;Friend suddenly messages me<br>"Have you heard of a show called Gakkou Gurashi?"<br> Tell him I haven't <br> He tells me not to google it <br> Tells me to just watch it <br>"It's really adorable."<br> Download <br> Watch <br>I wasn't prepared for this. I wasn't prepared for this at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   <br>The dog is alive, unless Mii-kun is delusional too you can't chase after something that's not there</br>  Chapter 38 when?  Still too many gakkou gurashi threads a day   <br>epic blog m8, where can i subscribe?</br>  <br>I'll stop with the insults once you stop being retarded. It's fine if you have fair criticisms but the vast majority of your issues with the manga aren't the mangaka's fault, but your severe stupidity.</br>  <br>I don't know, maybe embers? Fire spreads you know. If that's not good enough for you, maybe flaming zombies.</br>  <br>I thought I would enjoy the manga more but the addition of the cute dog and Megu-nee(alive and not Yuki's imagination) has made it more. enjoyable</br>  <br>  flaming zombies. <br>Now i know who people couldn't face zombies in day 1, shit's 2spooky</br></br>  Zombie gets set on fire, goes to nurse's office. Zombie nurse is on a smoke break, zombie patiently sits down on bed to wait.  <br>She's just playing along with Yuki.</br>  <br> friend <br>there's your problem. You are just being delusional.</br></br>  <br>huh</br>  <br>I need to see that, now</br>  The filesize is too big for one image now.   Megu-nee's diary <br> next to last entry <br> ''I will live just to see them out the door.'' <br><br>Why couldn't it be true?</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is the last time I will respond to your hostility friend, I will let you have the last word or insult in our exchange when you respond to this in hopes you don't harass me in further discussion down the line.<br><br>It is in my opinion that the author leaving out the details of the fire spreading which could've been resolved in a few pages is a crucial mistake and somewhat lazy of him/or her I don't like to be "spoonfed" but at the same time I don't enjoy having to put together large details that author either in an oversight or out of laziness left out.</br></br></br>    <br> hotpants and garter <br><br>Truly a goddess</br></br></br>  The fire burned shit in the school because gas was leaking from a nearby car and there was an explosion. It's easy to assume the fire spread to part of the building and damaged some things.  <br>Glasses-slut is such a qt</br>  <br>She's alive only in her flashbacks anyway.</br>  <br> I don't enjoy having to put together large details that author either in an oversight or out of laziness left out. <br>How a fire immediately outside the school got into the school is not a large detail or mystery. Maybe he's right and you are just stupid.</br></br>  <br> depravity club <br><br>I don't like where this is going, gurashis are supposed to be pure</br></br></br>  <br>They have no internet so either they're playing single player splatoon or 1v1, either way that's not very fun.</br>  <br> Ballout 3 <br> New Vegas <br><br>Jeez, talk about post-apocalyptic survival inception cum social lampooning commentary.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  they are playing Splatoon </br>  <br>How it burned the rooftop is a mystery at least to me, remember the rooftop also contained the solar panels in addition to the crops so it being damaged was more important than the other levels being burned.</br>  <br>The point is that they've holed up in the university and are spending all their time drinking and playing games instead of doing anything useful.</br>  <br>The university is likely to have a backbone connection. It shouldn't be tied to the local service provider at that.</br>  <br>Fire spreads, especially upwards. There's lots of flammable things in a school. It's not that hard.</br>  <br>The real point is they trade sex for food and video games with the other bands of survivors on campus and are always looking to recruit new rape meat.</br>  <br>If they had a connection they would be trying to get help, not play vidya<br><br><br> implying the answer is that simple in this story <br> implying they havent just joined a sex cult </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just like /a/ would do in a zombie apocalypse</br>  <br>Hot air rises.</br>  <br>Well it's the unexpected best anime airing this season. It has cute girls doing cute things while trying to survive a zombie apocalypse. I mean who saw that coming?</br>  <br>I wonder what the Miiverse posts would look like in a zombie apocalypse.<br><br> If only places like universities have connections now, does that mean we've returned to the glorious pre-Eternal September days? </br></br></br>  <br>This is more like /a/ during a zombie apocalypse</br>  <br>Everyone reading the manga.</br>  <br> who saw that coming? <br><br>Only the relatively sizeable number of people here who followed the manga before the anime began airing.</br></br></br>  <br>Well what else would you do? They are in the middle of a zombie apocalypse and are in dire need of a breather so let them have a little fun while they can.</br>  <br>I'd be bullying Yuki in this situation to help pass the time</br>  <br> We're diejoubu <br> That Riimouto </br></br>  <br><br>I went in blind unknown of anything about the series. I just thought it was cute school girls doing cute things but wasn't expecting a zombie apocalypse survival series. I'm now reading the manga as this series made me pick up the source material.</br></br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=X3l<wbr>Z7k0ZIFU</wbr>  [ ]<br>Look at this magic sorcery. How can the fire be on top of a school like that? This is a plot hole in real life.</br></br></br>  <br> not trying to get the slut with the garters to at least suck your dick <br><br>Fag.</br></br></br>  <br> miki holding Kurumi's hand only <br><br>She wants the V so hard</br></br></br>  <br>Actually that would be /v/.</br>  <br>That's what Miki is for</br>  <br> We're doing great <br> Except for the 2 of us that are dead, the one of us who's half zombie, and the 2 who have had complete mental breakdowns and are living in a delusional world </br></br>  <br><br> truly miki is a best </br></br>  Why haven't the people at the university been rescued yet?  <br>I prefer Miki/Yuki. Their relationship seems more natural to me anyways. Miki/Kurumi feels more like 2 friends worried about each other.</br>  <br> implying megu-nee and the dog won't live </br>  <br>They shot at the helicopters with crossbows.</br>  <br>Given the circumstances I'd say they're doing pretty good compared to most.</br>  <br>Maybe they are in a high alert area where they are many zombies and it's hard to get to them.</br>  <br>For some unknown reason Miki with an eyepatch turns me on, what the fuck?</br>    Volume 16 got translated.<br><br> It was aliens all along! </br></br>  <br>this is getting more weird every chapter</br>    <br> ALIENS!? </br>  god I love this manga  Absolutely spooky.  <br>All fuckin right, now that was good.</br>  fuck aliens  <br>I call bait on that spoiler</br>  Hideooooooo! Useless piece of shit.  <br>Not much he could have done.</br>  The last few chapters of this volume is just wow.  <br>Dat Italian clock tower twist, I was euphoric.</br>  I just hope we don't have to wait so long for the next volume  Reminder there are zombies in this thread RIGHT NOW  I wish I was brave enough to read this didn't get past the 1st few chapters when the girl got zombied  <br>You must persevere. It's so rich and fulfilling.</br>  <br>Zombies in this thread? are you high?<br><br>That's just impossible.<br><br>Besides, it's not time to eat yet.</br></br></br></br></br>   Oda-sans last words were "YOUR COCK IS SO GOOD" <br><br>This fucking manga I swear.</br></br>  I don't know what the hell is going on anymore.<br><br>It reminds me of Gantz when it went to massive shit.</br></br>  Where can i read it???  <br>Batoto.</br>  Thanks for reminding me, OP.<br>Next volume never.</br>  WHAT IS EVEN HAPPENING ANYMORE  <br>awww shit, it's finally happening, best birthday ever</br>  <br>we bokurano now</br>  <br>I thought the same thing. It's not</br>  <br>is this guy a kurusu too? <br>when will there be a female one?</br></br>  <br>We don't know that. It is very likely, but that information came from a hallucinating zombie.<br>So yeah.</br></br>  <br> It was aliens all along! <br>That's not true tho.</br></br>  <br> reading manga online <br><br> helping someone read manga online <br>You both should know better than this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Conchita Wurst saves the day once again!</br>  <br>This manga desperately needs someone who played Cataclysm.</br>  <br>The fact that it got as much time as it did at the end of the volume I think lend it credibility. Surely you don't waste that much time if it isn't true.</br>  <br>Yeah, If they were in a hivemind then why were the other zombies confused as to what he was talking about if it wasn't just the usual delusions they spew out?</br>  <br> new release <br> not reading it online <br><br>Unless you go to shit sites the quality is exactly the same and unless you have shit internet, it loads instantly.<br><br>I only download series if I'm binging them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it reminded me of gantz the way they're in Italy.. although I can't see this turning to shit like gantz did</br>  <br>Yeah he was blonde with short hair before. The main girl is a kurusu.</br>  <br>I'm waiting for the reveal that the USA is responsible for everything</br>  <br> Yeah he was blonde with short hair before.  <br>Wait, am i missing something?</br></br>  <br>He explained it, they were chosen as the caretakers. Somewhat disconnected from the hivemind.</br>  <br>Much earlier chapter. We see him walking around Italy with fuzzy memory. You'll have to go through I can't remember which.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128527222 <br>Says you. Aliens in only a theory but regardless, it's all done extremely well. This manga just has masterful pacing.</br>  I still find it hilarious that there were a bunch of zombies having a conversation up there.  <br> We see him walking around Italy with fuzzy memory. You'll have to go through I can't remember which. <br>I'm pretty sure that blonde guy was walking around paris, then that zombie centipede thing crushed the church he was in.</br></br>  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUCCCCKKK WHHYYYYYY<br>;____;</br>  <br> not binging IAAH from the start every new release </br>  <br> that spoiler  <br><br>No one uses spoilers correctly anymore, I hope you are one of those people.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll guess with confidence this is the same guy.</br>  we need ultraman  <br> I still find it hilarious that there were a bunch of zombies having a conversation up there. <br>the next volume is even more hilarious with some NEET black ops™ having a full-on UFC brawl with a single zombie</br></br>  <br> you'll never become a symbiotic flesh structure with your fellow countrymen </br>  <br> mangafox </br>  aww she saved the little girl  I thought it was girl the entire time he was sitting down  <br>Me too.</br>  <br>Did they even know he was there? They didn't acknowledge him or his want for paninis at all.</br>  <br>Beat me to it.</br>   so jason gordon levitt is a zombie made by aliens, who kidnaps little girls so that his alien masters can fill her up with babies? <br> just like real life </br>  <br>why do all the attractive people turn into such well-spoken, knowledgable zombies?</br>  <br> At first I though he was a pedophile. </br>  <br><br>He reminded of the somewhat reasonable guy from when they were at that mall who turned into a zombie and jerked his dick off.</br></br>  <br>I forgot about that. Holy fuck that guy was amazing.</br>  God damn, I cannot handle how spooky this manga is at every turn.  <br> mangafox </br>  <br>I'm actually rereading the chapter he was in and a lot of stuff this italian guy connects to what he was saying.</br>  Is Hiromi a Kurusu?  <br>Yes. She turned and came back from it.</br>  <br>Read it, anon. The first few chapters are boring as fuck but it gets better.</br>  <br><br>Whelp I guessed wrong. That guy I was thinking of was in Belgium. He looked very similar in facial design. The Belgium guy was also implied to be a kurusu so I immediately jumped to conclusion.</br></br>  <br>Hiromi a bitch<br><br>R.I.P. best girl</br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't the aliens just release a virus that kills with 100% certainity and spreads very fast?</br>  <br>who here things ayy lmaos really did it?<br><br><br>probably because of the hivemind birthing alien hybrids bullshit</br></br></br></br>  <br>Aliens could work. They can't be beep boop type aliens though. Have to be something more like the gauna from Sidonia.</br>  <br>becoming part of this freaks me out less than becoming a zombie<br>like being torn to pieces and having my flesh eaten is more scary than being absorbed</br></br>  I was hoping the story would keep jumping to a different place after Itality, and we've already seen Belgium a tiny bit and also China but everything else has been Japan and it seems Vol.17 is gonna go with a new group in Japan. Would be cool to get other place and a little longer, but I seem to be the only one that doesn't care for Hideo and the main girl all that much.   volume starts <br> Oda gets bitten right away <br> not even on a cliffhanger of the last volume or this volume <br> they throw her in the trash compacter and leave her there <br>I'm sorry but what? I can't even feel anything from this</br></br></br></br>  <br>I know my friend, i felt that pain too. I fucking hate when they cut their hair.</br>  I swear this fucking manga man  <br>I actually really like Hideo because he's just an average joe that got fucking lucky because he owns a rifle. If he gets some sort of super power I'll be fucking pissed. Hiromi is whatever, don't care about her, Oda was a better character.<br><br>But it would still be nice if we got some other locations and sub plots in their, that tie into the main story. <br>The whole 2chan thing was pretty great.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think he's your average joe tho, more like your average 2chan user or something, he's really weird and annoying at times imo.</br>  What the fuck is even going on in this manga anymore?<br>Does at least the mangaka know where this is headed? <br>Why not just roll over and die, it's not like humanity can reasonably survive any of this, let alone defeat it.<br>Things will only get stranger moving forward</br></br></br>  <br>It's headed toward romcom</br>  At this point the manga has become better than Gantz with it's alien gimmick  <br>At first I thought those things would start fighting to the death</br>   post yfw they were infected all along   <br>They were not infected all along, I think the only got infected when the gigantic thing got to them in the tower, thats why they weren't able to understand each other up to that point.</br>  <br>It's had plenty of these cutesy moments already. Nothing new.</br>  <br>This. Why else would the girl have gone in their if she was so freaked out by them all of a sudden</br>  <br>8 chapters of them mentally preparing themselves for sex is not a 'moment'</br>  <br>Try a little harder to get that feel. It's more impacting because of how abrupt it was. When Hiromi beckons that Oda could wind up as a kurusu like her was a heartbreaker. It was such a desperate attempt and for oda to just keep on changing into one right after this shred of hope was dangled in front of us. Oh yeah, it's got feels.</br>  <br> 8 chapters <br><br>This is normal pacing.</br></br></br>  <br>I am with you anon. I will miss Oda-san.</br>    <br><br><br>UNINSTALL</br></br></br>  Can some kind anon post magent link please, my isp block all usual places, and i don't have animebytes account  <br> entire page for taking somethin off a shelf <br>Looks about right. Have you not read this whole mango? It's got this pacing all over the place.</br></br>    <br>dude one of them didn't have flesh on their leg, they were infected for a long long time, they just never realized</br>  <br>yes, the giant tree thing probably just made them aware of themselves</br>    <br><br>What you're saying makes sense but if that's the case, why them? Why did they have to bring to the tower in the first place? Couldn't the alie just pick some other random zombie in the street to take care of her? Because so coincidentally the alien hive would bring the girl to the tower where there is a mutant, which is theorized by the italian guy that mutants are also created by the alien hive, if thats true then they weren't the real care takers and he just made the wrong assumption, and the mutant is the actual care taker? Yeah this makes sense, damn so many questions.</br></br>  How did the girl know to raise her hand? Can the "handler" zombies talk?<br><br>So many questions.</br></br>   lolicon tentacles eggs impregnation aliens rape   <br>god damnit<br><br>i knew i should've been worried when i started to read vol 13 and this shows up</br></br></br>  <br> Oda dies and then she cuts her hair into an imitation of Oda's <br><br>Not sure how I should feel about this.</br></br></br>  <br>can't some of the zombies talk? <br>Or at least form some sentences, how ever Hiromi can understand them, so maybe the girl just has the same ability, there has to be something special about her since none of the zombies in the street attacked her in the first place</br></br>  <br>I want to know what the fuck that thing the loli was holding is. Is it really just a stuffed animal? What if it's actually a legit alien, like the asshole zombie guy jokingly said?</br>  <br>They can all talk, these were still in control without realizing they were zombies. They saw everyone else infected but themeselves and the girl.</br>  THERE'S A HUGE CHUNK MISSING ON BATOTO AND I WANNA CATCH UP NOW WHERE DO I FIND IT  <br>Only those that were given some humanity a top the tower, possibly to lure the girl uo there, most can't. They can form some weird sentences but that's just random babbling. The little girl is not the same as the Kurusus or whatever with long black hair and always in semi naked.</br>  <br>google</br>  Volume 17 and 18 when?<br>please tell me they at least work on the translations and don't wait another 6 months</br>  <br>Isn't the highschooler who likes the MC a mutant?</br>  <br> Why else would the girl have gone in their if she was so freaked out by them all of a sudden <br>Because all of them are like that, but these guys could actually talk and is offering to help</br></br>  HAPPENING  WHEN WILL THEY FINISH TRANSLATING BOYS ON THE RUN. <br><br>I'm suffering.</br></br>  <br>Presumably, yeah. She hasn't started walking around in her underwear, though.<br><br>She might be special, though, seeing as how she was able to communicate with zombies even before infection. Maybe she was supposed to be a queen like the little girl, but got infected by accident (The hivemind might not be able to control baby zombies all that well? Or it could be because the hivemind wasn't established strongly enough yet).</br></br></br>  <br>That's a decent theory, I just hope she doesn't get pregnant and somehow the baby being part Hideo or some shit would make him different from the other alien babies and become a the key to save the earth or whatever nonsense. Hope I'm wrong.</br>  <br>The point of the Queen zombie is to make a hybrid, it's easier to make a hybrid if Hiromi is already infected and gets preggo from Hideo.</br>  <br>A hybrid with the aliens, anon. A human-alien hybrid. I'm assuming the hive and the zombie guardians are supposed to keep the Queen safe after she's been impregnated by the aliens.</br>  <br>Yes but we're talking about the possibility of Hiromi being a hybrid and in that case she'd be infect already so what  says its true. But still I just hope she doesn't get pregant and that entire plot point is never explored.</br>  <br>That's assuming that the zombies are the aliens and not just a biological tool the aliens invented to make whatever race that's infected subservient towards them.</br>  i was so angry at this part  <br> Hideo stop trying to cope with Odas death, it's creeping me out, I'm a gril so it's okay for me to act like a demanding bitch. <br> man up, don't be a pussy just because your waifu died <br><br>I liked her before, but that one single scene made me hate her so fucking much, seriously fuck Hiromi</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can understand her. She doesn't want to see him breaking down in front of her when he should be more reliable "as an adult".</br>  Question, anyone know where to download I Am A Hero on Illumanati's site? Or are they the kind of group that doesn't bother with DL links and just uploads them directly to a manga reading site of their choice?  <br>Never mind, I found it. Although the DL link for vol. 16 doesn't seem to be working properly.</br>  Less NTR, more zombie killing please.  So, how high are the chances of this every getting an anime? (It's better than 99% of the shit that gets an anime adaption)<br><br>Also, I heard they are working on a live action movie of I am a hero, can anyone confirm this?</br></br>  <br>With the detail in environments, characters, and pacing, I highly doubt it. I agree with you though, this is 99% better than all the moeshit out there.</br>  <br>Man, you're not even gonna cut her some slack after she just had to crush the closest thing she had to a female friend in a literal trash compactor?</br>  <br> less NTR <br><br>Not with this mangaka. He's good but still relies a bit too much on contrived NTR/despair bullshit. It's not as bad in I Am A Hero though, definitely feels relevant and not just there for "wow look at the way I kick this character while he's down aren't you sad aren't I such a good writer".</br></br></br>  <br>Not the guy you're responding to, but that scene in v15 where she points the shotty at Oda really made Hiromi's stock drop for me.</br>  <br> Probably the same amount of chances 7seeds has.<br> none ;_' </br></br>  I was laughing the entire time. They just killed her so quickly.  <br>Fags who can't into IRC. I love Illuminati releases.</br>  <br><br>oh shit <br><br>she was really gonna kill her</br></br></br></br>  why can't we go back to vol 1-2 feels?  <br>We do though</br>    i really liked this part for some reason  <br> feels <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>    Would you Hiromi?  So the zombie that "ate" MC was a combination of the naked emperor, the mask kid, and knife? Why did they save MC?  <br>They didn't save MC, MC saved himself as far as I could tell.</br>  <br>When did this happen? RAWs?</br>  <br><br>WHAT?<br><br> do they do it for real or is it a dream/hallucination? </br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you a guy from Illuminati?</br>  <br>Why they swallowed him then?</br>  <br><br><br>Man you guys are slowpokes. People were spoiling a little while back.</br></br></br>  <br>It's from the chink scans.</br>  <br><br>Not all of us browse 24/7 <br><br>if you can just like us to the archive</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would anybody want that?</br>  <br><br>Nevermind found it</br></br>  <br>seems more like otakubait</br>  <br>They were eating him and then, maybe, Hideo somehow connected with their hivemind? Then mask kid helped Hideo take control of the body?</br>  <br><br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/126795<wbr>484/#126795765<br><br>if anyone is interested</br></br></wbr></br></br>  Do you approve of aliens?  <br>I don't approve of anything post vol 13</br>  <br>I really do, shit got really interesting, a zombie story that I can actually enjoy, and it's from Japan.<br><br>I was really surprised with the events on volume 13 and 14, but now I'm sold.</br></br></br>  Guys, I'm scared.  What the fuck is going on? Seriously this shit is getting on my nerves. I really like dropping this manga just so i can avoid the tension  <br>As long as it stays an in-universe theory. <br><br>I don't want a final showdown with Hideo and the alien mastermind, like the ending of Spriggan.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why the hell does this thing look like it should be chanting "WASSHOI"?</br></br>  <br>my fucking sides<br><br><br>Buckle up anon, this ride isn't getting any less rough.</br></br></br></br>  Are the people at the end of the volume new?<br><br>How many viewpoints have we seen so far?<br><br>Hideo's edito who was the zombies.<br>That French guy who was the zombies.<br>The Italians and the tourists who was the zombies. <br>The other band of survivors who went to shit with the Kurusus.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oh shit, there is even a Berlusconi cameo in the part setted in Italy. Chapeau.<br><br>Also, I think the author may have watched too many cyriak videos on youtube<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=WQO<wbr>-aOdJLiw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br> good "different" manga. <br> getting an adaptation <br> ever <br>Actually, please no, they would fuck it up to hell and back.</br></br></br></br>  Do you think the Japanese find anime voice acting cringy as fuck like we do in English dubs?<br><br>I mean I think Japanese voice acting sounds great but I'm not Japanese so I don't really know that perspective. I just get that cringe/corny feeling while listening to English dubbed anime.</br></br>  <br>I'd say they're probly used to it. when you're new you don't really care much about the lines, just about not fucking up. when you're not new you've already seen so much it doesn't bother you anymore</br>  <br> Seriously, you could never become a professional voice actor in Japan <br>What are コネ and ごり押し</br></br>  <br> When i think about voice actors I always picture them as sad people who cry themselves to sleep <br>Nigger do you not know about JP VA's?<br><br>People like Sugita and Fukuyama Jin are the biggest bro's on the face of the planet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Neither English nor Japanese are my native language and English dubs sound terrible to me.<br>It's mostly low budget anime dubs that are so shit though. English voice acting in AAA games or Disney/Dreamworks animated movies is pretty good.</br></br>  Everybody in english dubbing is desperately trying their hardest to get the fuck out of anime roles and into something legitimate, just look at Troy Baker or Laura Bailey for instance. Two decent voice actors who have gotten "too big" for what they used to do.   MAJI DE!?   UMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  <br>e, zutto</br>  ERABE  TADAIMA!
