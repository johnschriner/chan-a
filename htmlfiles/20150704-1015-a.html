God Cloth VS God Cloth<br><br> With the 7 chambers as the stage, the all-out battle between Gold Saints and God Warriors has finally started. <br> Taurus Aldebaran goes up against the God Warrior Hercules, whom he has fought before. <br> Hercules has become extremely violent from the power of the Odin Sapphire given to him by Andreas. <br> Hercules unleashes a vicious attack, but Aldebaran, after discovering “true strength,” responds with an even greater power. <br> Meanwhile, in the Ice Chamber, a battle of Gold Saints between Shura and Camus has begun. <br> Both men hold their ground, until an extreme battle unfolds from the transformation into God Cloth. <br> Then, AFTER the battle against Miro and Shura, Camus realizes HIS TRUE FEELINGS for God Warrior Surtr, who was his friend. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Will Shura die?<br><br>Also<br> Then, AFTER the battle against Miro and Shura, Camus realizes HIS TRUE FEELINGS for God Warrior Surtr, who was his friend. <br>This looks a bit gay tbh</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, <br> apparently he gives an emotive speech about Shura. According to spoilers  </br></br>  <br>Saint Seiya should be gayer than that.</br>  <br>I wonder if there will be another libra temple scene with Camus and Shura.</br>     miro isn't really kil <br>uwutm8?</br>  <br>And what is the thing Andreas has in his special room?</br>  <br> Will Shura die? <br>Yes<br>The only Gold Saints standing will be Aiolia,  Mu, Dohko and Saga :^) </br></br></br>  is this shit canon?  <br>ayy lmao</br>  <br>No  or yes if Utgard is really Titan </br>  <br>toei canon<br><br><br> implying DM isn't protected by the power of love </br></br></br></br>  Biweekly reminder that Utgard is really Kanon,  he  looks the same from behind.<br>Only forget the details about muh height and hair/eyes color.</br>  <br>Sounds gay but Toei is making a mistake if it's Shura the one who's going to make Camus realize his TRUE FEELINGS. <br>Fujos are very defensive of their Camus x Milo OTP.</br></br>  <br> muh hair eyes color <br>Dye and contacts.<br> muh height <br>I don't know, man.<br>Unless he's using one of his illusions all the time, I don't see it happening.</br></br></br></br></br>  Episode now available. Waiting the [HorribleSubs] version   <br>ITS  late  TIME!!<br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=download&amp;t<wbr>id=707480</wbr></br></br>  <br>Toei is trying to rewrite everyone's decade old OTPs. CamusxShura, DMxMu if the spoilers about him saving him are accurate.</br>  <br>There was hand holding with Camus and Surt if that counts.</br>  Ayy<br><br> June 9th </br></br>  <br>Eh? That wasn't so bad, I'm impressed.</br>  Not sure how I feel about Camus legitimately being a traitor, his characterization in this show is all off. I got all excited too when he talked about a sword of ice, but he was just talking about Aurora Execution, and not a new move. Oh well.  Those God Warriors have no chance against the Golds, this is a pretty underwhelming.  <br>Hopefully the bit about Baldr being an actual god will make next episode's fight more interesting.</br>  <br><br>Yea, Aldebaran embarrassed Hercules without even fully awakening his God Cloth. I expected the power up and purple aura to actually do something, but I guess it was a fake out.<br><br>If we keep going at the rate of 2 GWs per episode, that will leave us time to face the real final bosses that come from Ygdrasil.</br></br></br></br>  why the fuck are god warriors so shit?<br>or are god cloths broken as fuck?</br>  <br><br>God warriors were always shit, now the gold saints can finally put them in their place with the debuff field turned off.</br></br>  <br>I thought the sapphires were going to make them OP as fuck but instead they are getting clowned left and right.</br>  <br>The one who translated probably thought that when he said "ken" he meant 剣 instead of 拳</br>  <br><br>I laughed my ass off when I saw that shit, how humiliating.</br></br>  OST track listing shows that Kiki is going to show up at some point soon? Maybe in a flashback?  <br> Milo and Camus have anime hair colors <br><br>STOP</br></br></br>  <br> tracks 32 and 33 <br>Kanon confirmed  or some Gemini drama </br></br>  <br><br>It's obvious that the masked GW is Kanon, he is even the personal guardian of Lyfia, the one who has revived the gold saints.</br></br>  <br>But he's so short, anon.</br>  <br>No.<br>His voice sounds nothing like Ryotaro Okiayu. <br>Just give up, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Toei is risking it. <br>DM x Aphro has been fujo's OTP for decades, making DM hetero was already a huge risk. <br>But making Camus gay for his other friend is too much. Fujos won't like it.</br></br></br>  what did Camus expect to happen after he defeated/he was beaten by Shura?  He is so broken by Shura getting killed   what happened to Lufia? <br><br>My poor waifu of the season.</br></br>  <br>It makes you wonder if someone at the writing desk is pushing their own OTPs.</br>  <br>Is Shijima in front of comatose Seiya?<br>Anyway, best SS news in a long time</br></br>  <br>Kanon NTR'd Aioria. <br>God make that happen</br></br>  <br>she didn't turn out to be a trap god, so we lost interest.</br>  Holy shit.<br><br>3 gorudo sainto are out of the game in one episode ?<br><br> Aldebaran's get captured was bullshit. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, it appears that Shijima somehow ends up in present day sanctuary, and witnesses the gold sacrifice themselves to the wailing wall. Whether he's actually in the present or just projecting his soul remains to be seen.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure everyone will be captured as soon as they clear their respective rooms.<br><br>So there are 2 rooms left and 3 golds wandering around and one M.I.A. , but only ONE God warrior left without a pair, how the hell will this play out?</br></br></br>  <br> He didn't job at all, so thats a win. </br>  <br>Yeah, big win for the taurus fans but they had no reason to get him captured other than easy plot progression.</br>  <br>Mu and Dohko have to survive if they're going to do the Athena Exclamation like in the OP.</br>  <br>Totally agree</br>  Shaka was looking extra moe in this episode.  <br>Aldebaran was out of fucks to give this episode.</br>    Why do you keep reminding me of better things Soul of Gold? <br>Is some sort of masochism?</br>  I like the implication that Mu's been spending this entire time just continually psychic bitchsmacking Fafner.  <br>Araki-sensei ;w;</br>  <br><br> Not even the crotch shot is good <br>Sometimes I wonder why do I keep watching this.</br></br></br>  <br>can't wair for next episode when Shaka will confirm he can kill Gods no problem</br>  <br>Why? What's the traduction?<br><br>I really hope the masked GW is not kanon</br></br></br>  <br>Shura looks like as in the SoG version.</br>  <br>Meaty looking thighs there, Camus.</br>  The thing i like about this ep the most aside from Camus action<br><br> God Warriors: WE ARE STRONGER NOW CAUSE OF ODIN SAPPHIRES <br> Gold Saints: Okay <br><br>and then they proceed to knock the God Warriors into a wall</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is implied that otherwise Gold Saint wouldn't even have a problem destroying most of the God Warriors. They seem to be slightly above a Silver Saint in power, maybe in equality to a Marine.<br>On the other hand, Andreas look upset about losing the statues, isn't that part of his plan?</br></br>  <br>who is the seiyu of masked guy in hell chamber? he seems a lot like Aiolos</br>  <br>I think Andreas is just in it for the shits and giggles at this point. He probably has bets going on each fight match-up.</br>  <br>Not Aiolos, i meant to say Seiya</br>  why is this show so terrible? the original series was gay as fuck but it certainly didn't suffer this much of QUALITY  <br>nah i dont doubt that the God Warriors arent close to Gold level but it was still hilarious</br>  <br> The thing i like about this ep the most aside from Camus action <br><br> &gt;God Warriors: WE ARE STRONGER NOW CAUSE OF ODIN SAPPHIRES <br> &gt;Gold Saints: Okay <br><br> and then they proceed to knock the God Warriors into a wall <br><br>And then we got a shit episode because it ain't about having good fights but just muh constellations</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The original series quality vary depending on the studio animating that week. But it had something SoG truly lack, and that's a good director.<br>Seriously, the general directing is as so basic and plain is boring.</br></br>  <br>Because that's the future of anime.</br>  <br>Especially as the moefags take over and anime gets more and more niche. Looking forward to a future of nicovideo streaming exclusives.</br>  <br>Did you truly expect it to be anything else, anon.</br>  <br>this am just waiting for the faggot to start a drinking game that correlates with how many people die in a chamber.</br>  <br>The twist is he's been broadcasting the fights all this time to an international audience and the GW are dying for nothing. It was all a moneymaking scam.</br>   tfw Shura and Camus not working together to defeat Surtr    still no best saint kicking ass   <br> Abel movie  <br>God damn this one was amazing.<br><br>Too bad it was rendered non canon by what Camus said in this episode.</br></br></br></br>  <br> movies <br> canon </br></br>  <br>so Andreas is Toei?</br>  <br>And suddenly the pieces fall into place.</br>   Milo gets NTR'd again <br> even after he's dead <br>Suffering</br></br>  <br>I know, DM is taking his time.</br>  <br>So, Boueibu 2.0?</br>  <br>Can't wait to see the shitty adaptation of the shitty next dimension<br><br>So bad it's good</br></br></br>  <br>Shaka is on next week</br>  <br><br>Guys ...</br></br>  <br><br><br> best saint <br> not Mu <br> not even Lemurian <br><br>Plebs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>My African American brother<br><br>What happened to him in the end?</br></br></br>  <br>The original NTRer of Aioria.</br>  <br> Mu <br> the gold saint of please keep walking and kill Taurus. </br></br>   shaka has to fight an OP god warrior <br>Welp, now I'm really starting to believe the chink spoilers.<br><br><br>For those who don't know  They say Shaka is going to lose his fight </br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess Cancer has to save his ass.</br>  <br>Chinese spoilers say Fafner's going to almost take him down, then DM steps in and saves him while dying himself.</br>  <br>Preparing the tissues then<br><br>Or at least I hope it's better than this Camus bullshit. It was so boring.</br></br></br>  <br>He's the best at other things...<br><br>like capturing all of our hearts.</br></br></br>  <br>Saga is closer. And dear lord, that would the best team in the history of Saint seiya.</br>  <br> What happened to him in the end? <br>Mu is dead  or maybe not <br>But it could be a good opportunity for DM. He could to avenge Helena.</br></br></br>  <br>Tell us more about those chinese spoilers, anon! Also, today's episode was entertaining</br>  <br>You mean avenge his foreverhusband Aphrodite.</br>  <br>Baldr defeating Shaka was from the same source.</br>  <br>:3</br>  WE GOD WARRIORS NOW<br><br>SEPTEMBER 25th WORLDWIDE RELEASE<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VnT<wbr>T8eVzlw8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>    <br>yeah lookin good.<br><br>needs mermaid chick to be playable too though</br></br></br>  <br>But why another fighting game.

Soul of fat!<br><br>Obligatory:<br><br>Deathmask <br>POWERGAP<br>Saga - Shaka</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know. Seiya is Kurumada's self-insert and Kurumada isn't attracted to females</br>  <br>Just put the gold saints in dresses, half of them already look like girls.</br>  <br>Speaking of that, was anyone here for the last thread's speculation that all the Gold Saints were based off Kurumada's love life? It was woefully cut short.</br>  <br>Of course anon, more beautiful equals more power.</br>  <br>That means he was rejected by a Cancer girl/boy.</br>  <br>Story was he dated a Pisces who left him for a Cancer. Also that Shaka was designed after an old girlfriend.</br>  <br> Just put the gold saints in dresses, half of them already look like girls. <br>Agree</br></br>  <br>He's such a nerd, also he draws worse than Oda.</br>  <br>Oda has an artstyle, he is not bad at drawing.</br>  <br> this is what piss drinkers believe </br>  <br/>  <br>Soul of Gold could have been so different.</br>  <br><br>He can draw anything he wants and knows many styles, you can see it in the artist's portrait.</br></br>    <br>http://es.onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/N<wbr>otas_del_autor<br><br>In Spanich for you spic.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>What a waste. I hate Seiya</br>  <br> You'll never see cute Gold Saints doing cute things </br>  <br> Not even Furuya as Seiya. <br>SHITSHITSHIT</br></br>    <br>The real tragedy here. Or even do a prequel with Gold Saints before Episode G.</br>  <br> Spanich <br>Stop reading there, stay delusional.</br></br>  I like Baldr but Shaka will kill him.<br><br>Saga versus Sieg Jr then?</br></br>  <br> more beautiful equals more power. </br>  <br>Victory is mine, but the enemy was too weak. I feel empty.</br>  <br>Oh, you know<br><br>just "humor me... oh, right, same old same old"</br></br></br>  Good night sweet Prince, you were too good for this shitty anime.  <br>  nose shadow <br><br>wat</br></br></br>  <br>Take Shaka with you, please.</br>  <br>It seems that way.<br>Also, that would explain the "Gemini drama" here </br></br>  <br> this shitty anime <br>It hurts.</br></br>  <br>At least there was a little improvement on QUALITY this week.<br><br>A little improvement.</br></br></br>  So will Aioros get his own fight against Andreas or some end boss, or he'll just come back at the end for a team attack to take down Yggdrasil just like with the Wailing Wall?  <br>let's just remember the good time</br>  <br>Last week was downright terrible.</br>  <br>can't wait to not play this</br>  So my Latin american brothers, what the fuck is this? I have been out of the loop on Saint Seiya for a while, is this a new series with the classic Gold Saints?  If I wanted to get into Saint Seiya should I start from the first series or can I jump in anywhere?  <br>all you need to know is that deathmask is the only straight saint, thus the worst saint.  its toei milking the gold saints to show off their over designed god cloths with an ok story and tons of quality. </br>  <br>Are you English only, or do you speak a romance language, Japanese or Chinese? Because the answer will be different.</br>   the subs calling camus fist of ice "sword of ice" <br><br>despite how wrong that is its kinda cool in the context of the guys he fought were using swords...</br></br>  <br>I speak Spanish, was the series not subbed entirely or something?</br>  <br>I don't know, Aldebaran doesn't ping my gaydar.<br><br>Then again, this could be why he's a jobber.</br></br></br>  <br>The Spanish dub is legendary at this point. Even the fuck ups are.</br>  <br>Lots of drama with ADV going under thus no English subs for the entire classic series that aren't the Hong kong ones. Plus, scanlations for the multiple spinoff manga are either slow in coming or non existent.<br><br>However, the English DIC dub is a work of art.<br><br>Since you've got Spanish, try the classic series from the beginning, if the first few episodes aren't your thing, try skipping to the Sanctuary arc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As far as I know you have.<br><br>Saint Seiya manga (classic one)<br>Saint Seiya anime (classic one)<br><br>Saint Seiya Hades arc bunch of OVAs that adapt the last part of the manga not adapted on the original series.<br><br>All of this I think is available in a bunch of european languages, Spanish/Italian/French and Latin american Spanish as obvious choices, no idea about english.<br><br>Then shit goes nuts. I think there are several spin off and continuations and prequels.<br><br>Episode G (manga), prequel about the fight of the golden saints against Chronos and the Titans. No idea if it has an anime.<br><br>Lost Canvas (manga) even older prequel of the previous saints 200 years before the events of Saint Seiya. I think there is an anime as well.<br><br>Saint Seiya Next Dimension (Manga), direct continuation of the manga.<br><br>Saint Seiya anime movies, there are like 4 that are typical anime movies that are mostly filler during seasons. And one that was a continuation of the manga but before Next dimension? Shit I don't know anymore<br><br>And then Saint Seiya precure, which I don't remember and then this which I don't know what it is and a lot of shit I am sure I don't know even exist.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No anime for Episode G, but there is Episode G Assassin.<br><br>And there's a great anime for Lost Canvas but it only got two seasons.</br></br></br>  <br>Fixed :^)</br>  <br><br><br>I guess I'll start with the classic series then, can I find it on Nyaa or am I going to have to look for it?</br></br></br>   the best saint seiya spin off will never get animated   <br>More like cropped. <br>Just looking at the hair pisses me of.<br>It feel like SoG is saying "Look, I can animate this scene too, because I'm a big boy"</br></br></br>  <br> Santia Sho <br>What the fuck is that? When I though I hear everything about SS spin off. Someone should make a list I am completely lost already.</br></br>  On the bright side, best character is still alive.  <br>But for how long.</br>  <br>2 or 3 more episodes.</br>  <br>Saintias = female saints<br>Sho = Shoko = MC = Equuleus Shoko = Eris' chosen host<br>that + Milo pandering<br><br>that's pretty much it<br><br><br>somebody in the staff has got to be a cancer, I mean they basically equated the guy as one the "look forward to this mutherfucker showing up" alongside Shaka and Saga.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More like look forward to this motherfucker jobbing.</br>  <br>Team Cancer is best team</br>  So, it's pretty much straightforward from here on?<br><br> Mu vs Fafner <br> Aioria vs Frodi <br> Dohko vs Manlet <br> Shaka vs Baldr <br> Saga vs Siegfried Jr. <br> DM vs Andreas <br> Athena exclamation against final boss <br> Aioros "lol I was not dead guys, let's take down this tree" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably someone mentally scarred from having to play Cancer every time everyone played Saint Seiya at recess.</br>  <br> mfw is just Dokho and Aioros now <br>Being upper houses is suffering</br></br>  <br>More like<br> Mu vs Fafner <br> DM vs Fafner <br> Aioria vs Frodi <br> Dohko vs Manlet <br> Shaka vs Baldr <br> Saga vs Sieg Jr. <br> Andreas vs Athena Exclamation <br> Everyone vs Tree </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Turn all Gold Saints into girl.<br>Make a moe show about their daily life.<br>They learn valuable lessons about friendship.</br></br></br>  <br>If by friendship you imply lesbians then yes.</br>  <br>what would they do with aldebaran?</br>  <br><br>This info is a bit outdated. Crunchyroll subbed the classic Sanctuary arc in its entirety, and you can find scan rips of the viz translation of the entire manga in high quality, name changes aside. <br><br>http://www.crunchyroll.com/saint-se<wbr>iya-sanctuary<br>https://bakabt.me/torrent/175323/sa<wbr>int-seiya</wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Strong and cheerful sporty girl who feels awkward being the tallest.</br>  <br>The tall school girl who feels insecure about their height. <br>For all amazon lovers out there</br></br>  <br> crunchyroll <br>Is a premium account necessary?</br></br>  <br>If you want to go past Sanctuary in the anime it gets a bit harder, though. By the time I got to that point, I was invested enough to sit through the janky subs, but it wasn't ideal.</br>  Weekend Waifu/Husbando Drawthread #2<br><br>Remember to take it easy!<br><br>Old thread </br></br></br></br>  Good afternoon everyone.

Just look at this shit <br>Doesn't matter if you worked hard. You're not hakase so expect a rerequest!</br></br>  <br>Even if that were true, completely ignoring the delivery was a terrible thing to do, he could've at least acknowledged the attempt.</br>  <br>What? I thought it was genuinely nice and when I did a reverse-image search nothing came up.</br>  <br>But hakase's drawings are ugly as fuck so those should be rerequested as well.</br>  <br>The problem is they were new refs. Now I'm stuck here, with no refs.</br>   people that don't draw in the first place getting offended for drawfags <br><br>What a laugh.</br></br>  <br><br>A weekend a few months ago when he kept fucking up the attempts to get the first thread up and running he tried posting something of similar quality. Rather than five minutes in paint, fives minutes on paper, but it's still shitposting.</br></br>  <br>Nah, I think most of the people who are getting offended are drawfags themselves.</br>  Reminder to not deliver for Haremfag like Mishafag. Avoid drawing for Misha, Musubi, Dyshana, Tohka, Tsubaki, Haruka, Meltlilith, Yamato, Rom, Pamela, Pyrrha, Pacifica and Twoearle.  <br>I think you're just being paranoid.

Just link the requests I'm not supposed to draw.</br>   Lolyfag sets a thread on fire within minutes for the hundredth time   <br>Everyone that isn't a drawfag</br>   attitude of this thread <br><br>Can't say if trolling.</br></br>  <br>And how the fuck is one supposed to keep track of that</br>  <br><br>My pic posted was from a request long ago in the drawthreads of Chiri hating modern abstract art.<br><br>The Orihime falls short of what I would call good but it is really, really close to being a decent stylistic drawing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's been much worse.</br>  <br>le circle maymay</br>  <br>You're a drawfag right? You should already be in their group<br>If not, draw whatever, since they're going to rerequest anyway</br></br>  <br>Nah I'd rather not be a part of their shitty circlejerk.</br>  <br/>  Requesting Crona watching 4th of July fireworks. Anything else would be fine too, of course.<br><br>Thanks, and enjoy your weekend!</br></br>  Requesting Misato playing an intense game that uses a gun peripheral at the arcade or just something at home like Duck Hunt. Optionally have her use a real gun by mistake, destroying the machine. However, if you're interested in drawing something for  Canada Day  instead, I would like to see that.  <br>Just don't draw any /v/ characters. Or any of them.

Feels good to have some fresh Morinaga Milk stuff  <br>Okay OP, what's the ca-<br> Citrus <br>Goodbye</br></br></br>  Whoops, wrong picture. My bad.  <br><br>kek</br></br>  gjhgujh  <br>kkkkkkkkk!!!</br>  Murcielago got an anim ated comic (motion comic)   What is this face trying to convey?  <br>Man sometimes it feels like Morinaga's just phoning it in with some of her recent stuff. Same two designs she's used since Girl Friends with a new haircut.<br><br>Shit, Morishima Akiko'll throw in an androgynous butch-looking takarazaku looking types every other mango.<br><br>At least this one gives me hope though.</br></br></br></br></br>  Real yuri is meh. Yuri undertones or played off for comedic purposes is better.  <br>My money's on the next plot derailing love interest in Citrus being a cyborg twin.</br>  <br> animated by shaft <br>If only they make sax scenes</br></br>  <br><br><br>animated by... some site that does motion comics<br><br>https://vimeo.com/132566751<br><br><br>I'm actually kinda sad that this might mean there won't be an actual murcielago anime</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It is out.  <br> You cannot gauge ONE's capacity to work. Just because you say someone "doesn't have any idea", that doesn't mean you do. You're far from convincing in your argument. <br>Yes, that's obviously why he delayed so many chapters or only delivered half chapter a hell lot of times, amirite? Are you a legit autist? Be honest please. Acting like writing and drwaing a manga ON YOUR FUCKING OWN is simple is 1/10 b8 and pure delusion.<br><br> If he's willing to do that, why wouldn't he for his story that's been selling well and is getting an anime? <br>explained over here <br>, you have no reading comprehension. And you can't even prove anything you are saying.<br><br><br>Literally how new are you that you don't know what Original Work by/CREATED by means? Are you suggesting that ONE is writing Mob, OPM and Murata's Filler shit at the same time? What are you, autistic?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How does that prove that it's like that for OPM?<br>Come back if you have a statement from either ONE or Murata.<br>Until then: Story by ONE Draw by Murata</br></br></br>  <br>Stop acting so fucking dumb. Please. <br><br>When it's written "ORIGINAL WORK" and "MANGA", can't you comprehend what this implies? <br><br>A. ORIGINAL WORK (HINT: It means "NOT THIS THING HERE".)<br><br>B. MANGA (HINT: It means "THIS THING HERE AND NOT THE ORIGINAL WORK".)<br><br>What part do you not understand?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Police station special chapter shows how the HA isn't always standing atop a pillar of morality. Hero's are dicks too</br>  <br>At literally which point in time did Murata say that ONE writes it a new for him? Do you think ONE wrote all the omake for the volumes, all the special chapters, all the new section of chapters like splitting events into different chapters? All the changes of communication between the characters and the action scenes, do you belive ONE wrote those, you retard?</br>  This shit is already looking like Anime of the year.<br><br>Jesus Christ they got prostitutes,action, deaf badass, one eyed bad ass.</br></br>  funny meme  I know bro it's so epic and manly, awesome<br><br>only good anime this year, everything else is just pandering moeblob shit</br></br>  This is edgy bait, right?

Solid 5.5/10.  <br>B O O Y A H</br>  <br>in the gif he clearly is speaking....</br>  Kekkai Sensen of the season.

You must be one mature bastard  Looks like shit, son  <br>That's true actually</br>  We all know that Gate will end up being the WOTS because of its political and nationalism bullshit.  <br> anime of the year <br>Nah<br> AOTS <br>Possible</br></br></br></br>  <br>Finally, a mature anime, for mature people, such as myself... a mature person.</br>  It's the best anime I've seen in decades, 5/10  So far it's the only watchable anime this season, everything else is obnoxious and generic garbage  <br> damn good <br> 5.5/10 <br>Isn't that just slightly above average.</br></br></br>  <br>what anime is better this year?<br><br>dont tell me youre an oregairu faggot</br></br></br>    <br>We've only just hit half of the year. Give it until Winter to start calling AOTY</br>  <br>Gintama is really good, GATE is looking promising, and the fall/winter line up isn't fully announced yet</br>  <br>He has to really try, and even then he can barely speak.</br>  <br>First show was Gatcha and the one with the trap MC.<br><br>And even so, the amount of shitposting is ridiculous.</br></br></br>  <br>Excluding sequels and leftovers: Yurikuma, Koufuku Graffiti, Kekkai Sensen, Euphonium<br><br>Gangsta is definitely top 5 if it keeps up though</br></br></br>  <br>Sidonia by far.</br>  <br> music anime <br> AOTY ever <br><br>NO</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yurikuma, Koufuku Graffiti, Kekkai Sensen, Euphonium <br> Kek Memesen and Yuri shit <br>Aren't you even in the least ashamed of yourself?</br></br></br>  <br>Those are at least memorable and unique</br>  <br>You sure showed him by adding 'meme' to the name</br>  <br> Yurikuma, Koufuku Graffiti, Kekkai Sensen <br>These are trash.</br></br>  <br>Musical anime is not unique, they are never unique. They all have one of the same 3 formulas</br>  it has 0 cute grils so that's not possible  <br>ナイスベート</br>  <br> loli doctor <br> borderliner loli gangsta boss <br>m8 pls</br></br></br>  <br><br>looks pretty gay tbh</br></br>  <br>Which ones are better then?</br>  <br>they're going to be killed probably so no, I'm not dealing with this shit. Death flags are everywhere already</br>  <br>thats the joke</br>  <br>you've got me excited now</br>  <br> watch first ep <br> it's terrible <br>I downloaded the wrong show by accident, right?</br></br></br>  Bait/10<br><br>It was ok</br></br>  <br>Yahari and Danmachi</br>  <br> What is Nodame Cantabile? </br>  <br>Pleiades</br>  the mc is cute  <br>  Gate <br><br>I don't want to ruin your parade but Gate is absolute garbage. The source material is filled with obnoxious nationalism with bullshit politics. It may be a good trainwreak type of show but is it in no way a good show.</br></br></br>  <br>Generic and forgettable</br>  <br>Boring</br>  <br>And Yurikuma, Koufuku Graffiti, and Kekkai Sensen aren't?</br>  Looks like gay boring fujoshi bait of the year tbh.  <br>Exactly</br>  <br>boku no nigga.</br>  <br> flavor of the month mahou shoujo #352638 show <br> AOTY </br></br>  <br>I believe its time to kill yourself</br>  <br>I never said it was AOTY, anon asked what was better than Gangsta this year.<br><br> flavor of the month mahou shoujo #352638 show <br>It's one of the few decent MS anime from the decade.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ikuni Yuri &gt;&gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gangstawhatever</br></br>  <br> talking out your ass. <br>They didn't even die in the manga and Nico is basically loli doctors guardian angel.</br></br>  <br> It's one of the few decent MS anime from the decade <br>it's vannila shit, no deaths or suffering<br>fuck off</br></br></br>  <br>I don't really get where the people are getting fujo vibes. The first episode seemed to set up a pretty obvious love triangle.</br>  I would have said this was okay because they're trying to be serious, but then they have the niponese man dodging and deflecting a barrage of bullets in a narrow alleyway using a superior katana folded 1000x.  <br>JoJo</br>  <br>Three episode rule will be applied. It's been a while since I've seen a mature anti-moeblob so I'm curious.</br>  <br> implying deaf-kun isn't a moeblob <br>He makes moe shows seem serious as fuck.</br></br>  <br> mature anti-moeblob </br>  <br>Did I say they died already?

After the Sword Art Online parts are over, it gets really bad. Fuck that fairy shit.</br>  <br>You know what he he mean : sol with a full hight school girl cast.</br>  Why's everyone meme hating this? I haven't watched it but I don't think it deserves this hate <br>I read some of the manga a good while ago and I remember enjoying it <br><br><br>It was good considering the differentish art style which probably makes animation a little harder</br></br></br></br>   mc isn't a weak beta faggot that makes it fujoshit   <br> the differentish art style which probably makes animation a little harder </br>  <br>Feels like they're trying to hard to be cool</br>   That OST <br><br>I felt like I was listening to Champloo at some points, it's so fucking based,</br></br>  <br>anime in a nutshell</br>  <br>Yes, it was, yes it was.</br>  <br> 5.5/10 <br>that's incredibly generous</br></br>  <br>I like the OST on its own, but I'm not convinced it's right for this show</br>  <br>Chuunis will lick it up.</br>  <br>If you actually bothered to watch a variety of series instead of just limiting yourself to the top five /a/-approved shitposting fodder you'd realize it's fucking Pleiades, you faggot.</br>  MANIME-fags are the dudebros of anime<br><br>You can't prove this wrong</br></br>  <br><br> edgy <br> "I just noticed this anime is not a comedy or slice of life" </br></br></br>  <br>Is this a good or bad thing?</br>  <br>No, they're usually fedoratippers</br>  <br>negative connotation</br>  <br>Bara anime</br>  <br><br>cawadoody dewrito kings</br></br>  <br>Does anyone even use that term seriously?<br>Whenever I see it it seems to be bait.</br></br>  <br>No, it's always bait, usually accompanied with image.jpg and BOOYAH</br>  How many episodes are out right now? Is it worth catching up on?  I noticed some choppiness at the animation. What do you guys think of it, if you noticed?  <br>1, and no, it's shit.</br>  <br>the first episode is all thats out. <br>already staying true to the manga and its looking amazing.</br></br>  <br><br>Great, that means I'm right on time to jump the bandwagon.</br></br>  <br>Same composer</br>  <br>Manglobe and bad animation go hand in hand.</br>    Jesus fucking Christ, I can't even watch past the OP. <br>It's like they just rammed in everything possible to make it appeal to 14 year olds. Drugs, sex, wubwub, weapons. Don't even get me started on the guy dodging bullets and slicing people in half with his katana.<br>This show is the biggest piece of shit you could possibly find.</br></br>  <br> Kekkai Sensen <br> not edgy <br><br>k</br></br></br></br>  I can't believe Manglobe is still alive  <br>What is that a spoiler?</br>  <br>fuck man? spoil so hard....</br>  <br>Yaharifag please</br>  <br><br> Lmao tru <br><br> I hate reddit so much </br></br></br></br>  <br>Rumours are saying they're working on new seasons of Hayate and Zettai Karen Children.</br>  <br>Maybe because there's the manga that people have read beforehand.<br><br>It has its good points, like a few interesting character that can carry you through most of it, but the manga tries so fucking hard to be a gritty Black Lagoon x10, with rape and gore thrown in for good measure and a nauseatingly repeated hamfisted message of "oh look at them poor oppressed people". The plot and some character actions make some rather strange turns that don't make much sense on closer inspection. Less would have been more on various aspects.<br><br>But don't let me detract you from it. You can find all of this out on your own. It was an interesting enough read for the 30 available chapters I read at the time, but I don't really feel the need to dive back in.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't post that shit here faggot, fuck off.</br>  <br> implying we aren't little girls </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127540429   <br>she is alive only her arm is cut off.<br>the english scans are so freaking slow i just go to the chinese scans its up to chapter 41 now</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127540429 <br>There is no containment<br><br>http://www.cbc.ca/news/trending/red<wbr>dit-users-lock-up-site-in-protest-o<wbr>ver-employee-s-firing-1.3136856</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Man, you know you're just spoiling everyone twice as much by reassuring them right?</br>  <br>Gangsta is being published by Viz in the US. <br>The scanlation was dropped a long time ago.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127540429 <br>No, you fuck off.

Someone would probably have to scan the English published version if you want it for free in English now.</br>  Why Western-bait anime is getting so popular now? First Kekkai Sensen now this.  <br>You are a faggot of the lowest tier.</br>  <br><br>How do you know you are even spoiling it for the other person? You likely aren't. You are are just as bad if not worse.</br></br>  <br>good that i got you rustled enough to call me names.</br>  <br>Because there's increasingly a focus on the western market. I thought that was obvious. Then again, you are a tripfag, so idiocy of the highest order is to be expected.</br>  <br>No, actually I'm caught up. I'm just stating the facts.</br>  <br>you know you dont have to believe what i say to begin with right?</br>  <br> first Kekkai Sensen <br> implying there haven't been a ton of others <br>Just started watching anime this year, huh?</br></br></br>  <br>your facts is wrong then because im not into men at all thereby you calling me faggot is not true</br>  If an anime having prostitutes is what makes it good for you, then you should check out Idolm@ster.  <br> i am le trying to fit in ... !!! <br><br>stfi. n0ob ,,I,,(-_-),,I,,</br></br></br>  never change /a/  <br>Nope.<br>The correct suggestion is to watch Memoirs of Amorous Gentlemen.</br></br>  <br/>  Onepunch man is coming out fall guranteed anime of the year.  <br> reddit <br><br>Why the fuck are you there?<br>Why would you even know about this post?</br></br></br></br>  Any anime which isnt moeshit is above average and this is above above average<br>So its AOTS already</br>  <br>Gathering bait material. <br>Seems it was rather successful.</br></br>  Looks like edgelord bait. I'll stick to my low test slice of life for a low test beta like meself.  <br>Mute is not able to speak but hear. He's deaf, there's a part where his part fires a gun next to his ear and had to look at it to realise it was there.</br>  <br>Circumcised nigger loving bullshit.</br>  Any of you fags have a webm of Nicolas signing in the ED?  Alex and Nic are far too lewd.  I wanted to have ultra violent sex with Nicolas ever since I first started reading the manga years ago, now with the anime I realized I was totally right.  <br>Best pairing mang</br>  <br>I didn't think I would enjoy it as much as I did, which isn't to say much, cuz I thought I would find it disgustingly edgy for my tastes.</br>  Is this gay porn? Because it looks like gay porn.  <br>I'm sure you're an expert.</br>  <br>Is this a fear of your own sexuality?<br>Because it reads like a fear of your own sexuality.</br></br>  <br><br><br>No really, he looks delicious.</br></br></br>  I just finished the first episode and damn, this show is fun!<br><br> Good looking setting <br> Somewhat likeable protagonists <br> Deaf swordsman instead of a blind one <br> Smooth action <br><br>I guess you could describe it as Triage X if it weren't shit. Looking forward to the next episode. What day is it coming out?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   first episode only covers first chapter of the manga <br>Looks like it's not going to cover much of the material at all. Slow paced as all hell.</br>  <br>No, it's more likes Dogs: Bullets &amp; Carnage or Jackals. Just starting watching anime, huh?<br><br> What day is it coming out? <br>Really, anon? This is so trivial to find out, I'm not even going to spoonfeed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Summer is here</br>  <br>or Until Death Do Us Part</br>  <br> Just starting watching anime, huh? <br>Well, this is not really the genre I'm usually into. I mostly watch  shonenshit </br></br>  <br> ultra violent sex <br>He deserves to be loved tenderly.</br></br>  I disliked it. Too tryhard.<br><br>Some people here really praise anything that is edgier.</br></br>  <br> anything which isnt SoL moeshit is tryhard <br><br>Im getting sick of this meme</br></br></br>  <br> I want to not be able to walk for few days after the sex and during my recovery time we can make tender love. </br>  <br><br>The fujos are here</br></br>  <br>Are you a feminist or something? This low level of argumentation is usually only used by them.<br><br>A show can be not moe and not tryhard.</br></br></br>  <br> Nah, I'm just gay as fuck and Nicolas is perfect. </br>  <br> Are you a feminist  <br>Wat.<br>Hes clearly implying this is tryhard because it doesnt have cute highschool girls in it</br></br></br>  <br>No, not because of that, but because of the idiotic kind of argument.<br><br> You don't think we should ban magazines with women in bikinis? You are a cheetos eating neckbeard. </br></br></br>  <br>It's like he only knows how to draw exactly one face</br>  <br> That's okay, I assumed you wanted to violently dick him rather than the other way around </br>  <br>this is the worst anime to thing of when thingken of genuine</br>  12 episodes confirmed  <br>source? If that's true than it will be a masterpiece with a anime original end, I'm hyped.</br>  <br>I work for manglobe</br>  <br>Manime's so great right guys? It's great being mature.</br>  <br> I'm so new guys! </br>  <br>Oh, but did you ask the boss' dog first?<br><br><br> moe weebos and NEETS are this butthurt <br>One billion keks</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like the way they did Nicholas's speech. Props to the VA.</br>  <br> What's wrong with being new? </br>  Why do these kind of anime threaten moeshiteaters so much?  <br>They're not used to anything outside of their comfort zone of daki pillows and neon colored hair.</br>  <br> keks <br><br>Reddit please leave.</br></br></br>  I really liked the episode. I dont understand why they would save a trashy whore like her, though.<br><br><br> moeshiteaters <br><br>Probably because of stuff like this. You guys act like redditors/normalfags.</br></br></br></br></br>  Is moeshit finally dying?  <br> muh moeshit <br> muh edgy manimoos </br></br>  <br>Unfortunately no.</br>  Nicolas is fucking great, When do you ever see a deaf character who is also incredibly strong, You fucking don't.<br><br>I can't wait for more.</br></br>  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1pKgBm8Aa58mjB1hYhbK-VOPZsRBTXBuPBz<wbr>w8Xikm2ss/pub?embedded=true<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127491<wbr>389/</wbr></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  なせば大抵なんとかなる！<br><br>As long as you never give up and you keep pushing to better yourself, you'll make it no matter what. You CAN learn Japanese!</br></br>  お疲れ様        If you say something like 来週そこに行って、食べ物を食べたいです, are you saying that you will go and that you want to eat a food there, or that you wan't to go there and eat food there. I mean, is it<br>来週そこに行く。そして、食べ物を食べたいです or<br>来週そこに行きたい。そして、食べ物を食べたいです?</br></br>  <br>The latter</br>  are these subs off?<br>it reads as tortilla de itadakimasu<br>but surely it cant just translate it to "i shove it all in a tortilla to eat" too much shit is added even for a succinct sentence like that. wouldnt it make more sense to say "i accept the contents in the tortilla"?</br></br>  <br>Ok. So never the former?</br>  How long are you planning to keep creating these posts?<br><br>I need to finnish learning Russian before I can go to Japanese</br></br>  <br>i may be a noob but why is desu after a conjugated taberu? is it an auxiliary? i know desu is a copula but i dont think thats how it works.</br>  <br>What came before it?</br>  <br>Is there more to the sentence? Maybe after or before it?</br>  <br>Literally it means "I received (something) via tortilla". It is hard to translate to English, so those subs are as good as any I guess. But basically it means she will eat something in the tortillas<br><br><br>No, when chaining with te-form, the last conjugation decides the tense of all the words</br></br></br></br>  <br>DJT will never die, anon.</br>  <br>nothing it starts off like that and ends like that</br>  <br>receive/will receive, not receiveD, sorry.</br>  <br>Why wouldn't で be used like "with"<br>I eat (...) in a tortilla (lit: using a tortilla)<br><br>Changing it to shoving it all in a tortilla is a bit strange given that we have no context, but whatever miku is eating, she put it in a tortilla.</br></br></br></br>  If anyone is new to japaneeeese...<br><br>Neptunia Rebirth3 is a deceeeeent gaaame to pick up....<br><br>Because plutia talks reaaaally sloooow, so it's easy to understaaaaand.</br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah, later on it talks about vitamin c. and usually itadakimasu is used in the sense of food so i guess thats they threw in the infinitive form of to eat in there.</br>  <br>Russian is next on my list, after I get decent at German.</br>  <br>She talks so slowly that the anime had to speed her up uncharacteristically for airing purposes.</br>  Why do translator's use " I won't forgive you" for 許す, usually during action scenes when they should be saying, "I won't let you get away with this" or "I won't allow this"  Even though I stayed up all night drinking and playing 15 hours of videogames.<br><br>Should I still read and study or will it not matter?</br></br>  <br>Where you playing them in Japanese, at least?<br>if no, study.</br></br>  <br>I do believe once anything is changed into the desire (~たい) form, it acts like and い-adj. So the です　becomes necessary.</br>  <br>Nope <br>Super smash bros for fifteen hours with internet friends.<br>im still drinking.<br>Its like I am 16 again</br></br></br></br>  <br>The same reason why some translators use "It can't be helped" every time for 仕方がない, laziness and lack of creative English output.</br>  <br>仕様が無い</br>  <br>i see, since its pretty much an adjective once it has been conjugated to the tai form that means you can use particles since its derived from a verb form, right? like tabekunaino?</br>  <br>i mean tabetakunaino</br>  <br>http://www.guidetojapanese.org/desi<wbr>re.html</wbr></br>  <br><br>What do you mean? You can use particles on both verbs and adjectives, nothing special about the たい form in this sense</br></br>  <br>the link this guy provided me with<br>says so otherwise<br><br>"This means that all the particles we normally associate with verbs such as 「を」、「に」、「へ」、or 「で」 can all be used with the 「たい」 form, which is not true for regular i-adjectives"</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah, those particles, I thought you meant the の particle as that's the only one in your example "食べたくないの"</br>  <br>thats why i asked but that link he provided kinda answered it so</br>  I am not really studying in terms of reading but I am watching hentai and listening.<br><br>I think I deerve this breaks</br></br>  Am I correct in assuming that 羨ましい is a generic word for jealousy that can be used in normal conversation ("wow I'm jealous of your nice car") while 妬ましい carries a strong negative implication?  <br><br>also the no is used as a sentence final particle which has nothing to do with the verb form or it being an adjective</br></br>  Why does she sit like that?

If you're going to praise Inoue for something, do it for something that it's worth.<br><br> I loved Agito and Faiz, specially the misunderstandings FALLING TO RIVERS drama bullshit he's so known for. It's a guilty pleasure, like mexican soap operas </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You sure are doing a convincing job of telling us how bad these adaptations were.</br></br>  <br> Death Note was fucking terribly done, especially the arc post L death. <br>No, it wasn't. The only real difference from the manga is the ending, which I personally find to be better.</br></br>  <br><br><br>I'm not trying to convince anyone, if you're so buried in stupidity that you can't figure out yourself what's the difference between shit and chocolate and you flaunt it like a badge its just your own fucking problem</br></br></br>    There has never been another series that has depicted feelings of love more realistically than the way Yui treats 8man.  <br>It's just Yuifags, anon.
