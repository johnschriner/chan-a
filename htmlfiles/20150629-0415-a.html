[ What other entertainment media can get away with shoddy writing to the extent that anime regularly does?<br><br>Have you ever stopped and considered just how much money it takes to produce your average anime episode? We're talking like $100 a second, on the low end.<br><br>So, with that kind of money on the line, why is the writing often so poor? Even in popular, mainstream anime produced by large studios, plot developments can be completely erratic and nonsensical. Take Mirai Nikki: $130 a second. $70,000 an episode, yet they can't just sit down and make a coherent storyboard?<br><br>Why?</br></br></br></br></br></br>   What other entertainment media can get away with shoddy writing to the extent that anime regularly does? <br><br><br>All of them unfortunately.<br><br> why is the writing often so poor? <br><br>Because good writing doesnt equal more sales</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  High budget and good writing have nothing to do with each other.<br>Just look at Hollywood and prime time American television.</br>  Literally all of them. People act like it's hard to write a script or come up with a concept for a game. It's not. It's practically all luck of the draw. If the suits that don't know what you're talking about like the cut of your jib, BAM you got a piece of entertainment media in production. Just convince them that it will make them money and you're golden. That's all that matters. Having a high CHA stat is far more important than having an actual good idea or talent.  <br> Because good writing doesnt equal more sales <br>WHYwhyWHYwhyWHYwhyWHYwhyWHY<br><br>That can't be true. Granted, every story doesn't need to be Lain or the Silmarillion, but to THIS extreme? That doesn't make any sense.<br><br>It's not true.<br><br>It can't be true.<br><br>I refuse to believe it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What other entertainment media can get away with shoddy writing to the extent that anime regularly does? <br><br>American television and films.<br><br> So, with that kind of money on the line, why is the writing often so poor? <br><br>Because the consumer based is populated by morons who have no interest in coherent storytelling.<br><br>/a/ is representative of that. Think about how many idiotic waifu war/best girl threads there are?<br><br>It's these types of people who are the primary consumers of anime. All they want are animated breasts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  LNs. There's a reason why the shittiest anime usually happen to be adapted from LNs.  <br>American TV shows, to my knowledge, still have to have marginally coherent plotlines. That coherency can be cheesy or dumb, but it has to be coherent. Americans won't like it if things don't make any sense. Japan doesn't seem to give one shit like this.</br>  <br><br>How new are you?<br><br>To life in general I mean.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm just a little girl, Anon.</br>  <br> Take Mirai Nikki <br>If I take the absolute worst example from any medium obviously it will be utter shit.</br></br>  because japan has shit taste and people in japan who actually consume anime are  fat virgin nerds   <br> complains about writing in anime <br> uses a manga for an example <br>You might as well just complain about Japanese writing in general.</br></br></br>  Who the fuck watches anime for the writing  <br>Please find me a western equivalent. I just don't see something written with THAT extreme of a lack of regard, for anything, being able to achieve the same popularity in the US.<br><br>Twilight, Harry Potter, uhh... god knows what else. Yes, they're dumb, and have alot of insipid, juvenile plot developments: but there is a logical coherency to them. They are 'wrapped up' in a way that anime just doesn't have to be.</br></br></br>  <br>Nips don't care about shitty anime adaptation anon, no matter how shitty it is, as long as the original source is successful.<br><br>Now, on to LN successes, that's just because nips love shitty stories anon.</br></br></br>  <br> What other entertainment media can get away with shoddy writing to the extent that anime regularly does? <br>Television, movies, books, American comics, and video games.</br></br>   Implying pic related needs good writing.   <br> You might as well just complain about Japanese writing in general. <br><br>That's basically what I'm doing. In retrospect this thread should be posted on /jp/</br></br></br>  <br>Twilight is a best selling novel. CoD is a best selling game. Pewdiepie is one of the most watched Youtube celebrities. <br><br>Quality will never equal popularity.</br></br></br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br>/jp/ gives even less of a fuck than /a/<br>They only read VNs</br></br>  <br>I do</br>  <br>You are underage or mentally stunted then</br>  <br>I'll turn you to a big girl anon.</br>  In anime characters and design are more important than writing. Style over substance.  <br>Dude, look at the Simpsons. It has been utter dogshit for many years, but the merchandise still sells, and still turns a profit, hence why episodes still get made despite decreasing ratings.<br><br>You can also look at Family Guy for an example, it got shit on from the very beginning, and yet it was revived from cancellation because of powerful DVD sales and strong ratigs on Adult Swim.</br></br></br>  Good writing is not as important as you think. Or rather, this word "good" doesn't necessarily mean what you think it means. "Good" doesn't mean Shakespeare. It doesn't even mean, you know, Tolkien and uh, whoever the fuck wrote Lain (Konaka?). Mirai Nikki's writing is "good" because many people out there found it exciting and fresh and fun. No matter how much you don't like it, there's no reason that can't be one of many many qualifiers by which to measure the success and "good"ness of an anime.<br><br>If you're wondering why everything can't be highbrow and elaborate and artsy and, ugh, "objectively good", I'm sorry to inform you that what you think is "good" in that way is very very boring to many people. To write something that is "good" like you think things are "good", and yet is not boring to most people out there, is really hard and occurs very infrequently, and it usually gets scoffed by crowds like 4chan anyway, for being too popular.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off shiteater.</br>  <br>Family guy and the Simpsons are episodic comedies. Not character driven action "thrillers," of one sort or another, like the majority of anime.</br>  <br> bad is good <br>Stop jewing me</br></br>  <br> character driven action "thrillers," of one sort or another, like the majority of anime. <br><br>I think we're done here.</br></br></br>  <br> Family guy and the Simpsons are episodic comedies.  <br>That doesn't mean that golden age Simpsons episodes weren't well written.</br></br>  Nips probably don't give two shits to whether we understand their "good writing" or not. <br><br>Look at those real life le funny maymays, do they even make sense on how they just appear? <br><br> Hey it looks cool to put butter on everything <br> better tweet this and make this into a meme wwwww </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it so difficult to accept that whatever you felt when you watched Lain or Cowboy Bebop or whatever you thought was good, is the same feeling that someone else out there felt when they watched something like Mirai Nikki, or Guilty Crown?</br>  <br>Even non conventional shows like Sora no Woto fit into that same basic outline.<br><br> character drama <br> action / adversity <br><br>It wouldn't take much to turn it into a shounen.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It doesn't matter if it's well done or not, the only thing that matters is how you feeeeeel <br>No. You're wrong. Stop it please.</br></br>  <br>Search your feelings, you know it to be true.<br><br>You are not aware that light-hearted things can feel better than serious stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>Its so difficult to accept that some people have shit taste?<br><br>I liked plenty of garbage when I was a kid that Ive tried to go back only to find how shit it really was, some people stay with their 5yo tastes all their life<br>And you must be one of them because they tend to justify their shit eating habits by saying that "there is nothing objectively good lol"<br>Something only a kid would say</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You have to realize that objective quality doesn't exist though</br>  <br>Reported and flagged for promoting terrorism<br><br>stop samefagging</br></br></br>  <br>It's probably the only industry where character design is more important than everything else.</br>  <br>I'll take the retardation of Mirai Nikki over the boredom of capeshit any day</br>  I enjoyed mirai Nikki<br><br>But yes there are plenty of times that keeps making me go what the fuck! Why aren't x doing y?<br>I just kept watching instead and ignored the retardedness of some of the writing in the show because it was still entertaining</br></br></br>  <br>Oh boy here we go.</br>  <br>You are a fucking retard<br>Shut the fuck up</br></br>  <br> kids <br> not being convinced their taste is the best and only true one and OMG how can you like that, looooser, lol <br>No, the "objectively good" phase is the kid one.</br></br></br>  <br>You are deluded beyond belief.</br>  <br>Oh God yes, I'll fucking kill myself before I have to watch another cape movie. I don't know how people can just eat that shit up.</br>  /a/ - Its ok to eat shit<br><br>Not surprising though, anime is shit and you have to rationalize somehow I guess<br><br>Manga can be good sometimes</br></br></br></br>  <br> NO YOU <br>totally not the kid phase</br></br>  <br>There is nothing to discuss with a retard that doesnt have any real word experience, keep eating shit.</br>  <br> come in to thread <br> post once <br> get called a samefag <br><br>Who are you even saying I'm samefagging?<br><br>Anyways perceived quality is always going to be subjective. You can say something is shit, and maybe a bunch of people agree with you, but what if a majority disagrees?<br><br>Pretty much all arguments about quality are just going to boil down to pure opinion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no real world experience <br> strangers on internet have shit taste because they have no real world experience. and how do I know they have no real world experience? because they have shit taste. </br></br>  <br>Amen<br><br>Personally, I've been really surprised by what kind of themes and depth the comic book artists have been able to include in their utterly childish stories about musclemen playing dressup. But when it comes to the normie mainstream, the stories are so stale and cliche it makes me want to gouge out my eyes.</br></br></br>  <br>But thats fucking wrong<br><br>No one can deny twilight is garbage absolutely no one, not even the housewives that masturbate to it, when you present your arguments about why its bad they cant say anything back other than yes I know its shit but I enjoy it<br>Its still shit<br>Same as most anime<br>Enjoy it all you want, but be aware of what you are doing</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>All of your arguments about why it is bad are opinions though that's the problem.</br>  <br>They are not, have you never read an actual critic?<br>Go educate yourself please.</br></br>  <br>  no one can deny <br> ad populum </br></br>  <br>Partially this.<br>Especially, being "logical" (as cited from some previous posts) does not make a work good, and being nonsensical doesn't make it bad.<br><br>Also, though it would be difficult to cite them because I generally don't remember any titles, I hardly think that "bad" writing is a problem that only concerns anime or manga. Movies, series, books and video games seem to be exactly the same to me. There are masterpieces in every form of media just as there are popular "shit" (entirely subjective) in any media.<br><br>I'm actually more interested in understanding why some anime/manga fans genuinely think that said form of art is inherently or de facto inferior to books or tv series.<br>This inferiority complex seems much more inherent to anime than bad writing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When you enjoy something, it is not shit. Your enjoyment is reason enough to elevate it above shit status.</br>  <br> pixel count is an illusion </br>  <br>Some stories are objectively better than others. There is a structure to reality, and so the human being. We are not special snowflakes who are so completely unique that total shit for somebody else can *literally* be 10/10 brilliance for us. It can only be "seemingly" so. You can enjoy shit more than others for whatever reason. And that might be perfectly okay, maybe. But that doesn't mean that you have good taste.</br>  Japan is extremely conservative, things stay the same for ever. Main reason however is that Japanese artists cater to jap consumers. English market is way more competitive.  <br>Im done arguing with you manchildren.<br>Its so pathetic Im getting sad.<br>Enjoy your shit, see what that will get you.</br></br></br>  <br>lost my shit</br>  <br>It's hilarious AND powerful</br>  <br>Only non-retarded person in this thread. I'm surprised that on a board like /a/ where everyone calls each other tastes shit that people haven't realized by now that our standards for judging any work is far more variable than you'd think possible.</br>  <br> look up twilight critiques <br> majority positive <br> still a large division in positive and negative <br><br>Wow it's like different critics have different stardards which they use to form their opinion about things. Like they are different people with different opinions or something.</br></br></br></br></br>  What other entertainment media can get away with shoddy writing to the extent that feature film does?<br><br>Have you ever stopped and considered just how much money it takes to produce the average Hollywood blockbuster? We're talking like $20000 a second, on the low end.<br><br>So with that kind of money on the line, why is the writing often so poor? Even in popular, mainstream movies, produced by large studios, plot developments can be completely erratic and nonsensical. Take Avengers 2. $27000 a second, yet they can't just sit down and make a coherent storyboard?<br><br>Why?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> our standards for judging any work is far more variable than you'd think possible. <br><br>Sure it's variable, but it's not subjective like so many people are arguing.</br></br></br>  TV shows, books, movies, comics and games from personal experience.  <br> over the span of like 10 years <br> not even 0.001% of movies produced in that time frame <br><br>Try again, anime is shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Some stories are objectively better than others <br><br>No they aren't. They may be subjectively better but to be objectively better ever single conscious being that could understand those stories would have to unanimously agree that it was better.</br></br></br>  <br> Take Avengers 2 <br> plot developments completely erratic and nonsensical <br><br>It might be stale shit, but it's not that. See<br/></br></br></br></br>  I have the feeling many people in this thread have seen few to little anime (perhaps only dubbed entry level series on TV, and no more than 30). <br><br>I suggest to them to start watching airing anime for real, and learning a bit what it is before they continue to embarrass themselves.</br></br>  sometimes good taste is shit taste<br><br>take the movie the holy mountain for example, every artfag and hipster loved the film calling it original or deep or whatever, but once you watch it you realize that it's bland, its only purpose is shock value, it was written and directed by a jew and the plot made no sense whatsoever. At that point, you are given a choice: you either pretend that it's deep and artsy to fit in with the rest of the hacks that call it a masterpiece or you admit that it's shit and move on</br></br>  <br>The standards themselves can be objective, but valuing one standard over another is subjective. One person can like a certain story because he judges using standards of realism, while another person can dislike it precisely because of the realism.</br>  <br>Wrong. Reality does not require the consent, agreement, or approval of beings. It is what it is, regardless of what we think about it.<br><br>beings &lt; reality</br></br></br>  <br>No wonder anime is shit with these people as their fans</br>  <br>Except in reality there is no measure of quality. Perception of quality is something created by beings.</br>  <br>good.<br>reality &gt; being<br>now prove why "quality" belongs in the former and not the latter.</br></br></br>  <br> The standards themselves can be objective, but valuing one standard over another is subjective <br><br>To a degree, yes. But not absolutely, without conditions</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=v6k<wbr>EDZhY7So</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>This movie is shit, this is not subjective these are facts, even if you hate doug he understands movies.<br><br>The only defense would be "but I enjoyed it", its still shit anyways.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Perception of quality is something created by beings. <br>See<br><br><br>Not all, but some standards of quality are objectively better than others. For example, my waifu is objectively better than yours.</br></br></br></br></br>  Who cares about reality in  fiction  anyways?  Why can't anime have good writing like True Detective?<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/JHOGs5x90PU  [ ]</br></br>  <br>But the Holy Mountain is great. There's no deep statement really, it's just like, weird trippy shit happens and you laugh, you know? It's fucking hilarious.</br>  <br>The current lack of good fiction is a reality</br>  <br> my waifu is objectively better than yours <br><br>Wow you stopped even trying. Certain standards can't be objectively better because standards are formed subjectively.<br><br>Anyways your waifu also can't be better than mine since I have no waifu.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it's a huge waste of time, if i'd recommend comedy i'd recommend 13 moons</br>  <br>Your life is a fiction, that's why you want to watch reality on your screen.</br>  <br> lack of good fiction <br><br>Dem opinions.<br><br>I find that there's plenty of great fiction being written. Can't wait for more SLA.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Anyways your waifu also can't be better than mine since I have no waifu. <br>1&gt;0</br></br>  <br> standards are formed subjectively. <br><br>No, untrue. There is a structure and design to reality. Atoms work this way, and not that way. Gravity works this way, and not that way. The human being works this way, and not that way.<br><br>So it's not entirely subjective.<br><br> Anyways your waifu also can't be better than mine since I have no waifu. <br><br>my waifu &gt; nothing<br><br>Checks out</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't I wish</br>  <br>Deep.</br>  <br><br>It's not 1&gt;0.<br>You could say "having a waifu is better than not having a waifu".<br>Which would be an opinion.<br><br>Yes people do work a certain way which is why there are large agreements on quality for many things.<br><br>But you also have to realize that many humans only think the same way about very specific things, and very differently about others. You can't have objective quality with so many different standards existing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  No wonder anime is so shit when their fans even on /a/ have no standards whatsoever.  <br>No reason to put in any effort when retards will eat up literal shit</br>  <br> their fans even on /a/ have no standards whatsoever. <br>Just because I believe that there are no objective standars of quality doesn't mean I don't have my own standards.<br>For instance I hate most moeshit and many other series which are generally considered to be bad. I also dislike things which some people think are good.</br></br></br>  <br>You are a kid and you need to fuck off already.</br>  <br> people do work a certain way which is why there are large agreements on quality for many things <br><br>Consensus among humans has little correlation with reality in many cases.<br><br> You can't have objective quality with so many different standards existing. <br><br>Reality is not contingent on human opinion or perception, whether positive or negative. Theoretically, the objectively best story ever written could be something everybody hates.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> moeshit <br>This thread just sinks deeper and deeper.</br></br>  <br>Except again, reality does not have objective standards since all standars are created subjectively by beings.</br>  Anime is a costly production for virtually no reward and it takes years for most anime to break even, if that. Completely original anime very rarely sell.<br>Manga is way more popular in Japan, anyway.</br>  <br> You could say "having a waifu is better than not having a waifu". Which would be an opinion. <br><br>No, that would be a fact</br></br></br>  <br> there are no objective standars of quality <br><br>You must have some sort of mental issue man, Im sorry.</br></br></br>  <br>What are "standards"? Is it like, "I'm too good for this"? You're not going to watch something because you're "too good for it"? You're going to pretend you didn't like something, or you're not going to make the effort to try and like something, because you're "too good for it"? In that case, yes we don't have standards. That's one of the first things you have to throw out if you're going to be a part of /a/. And to be honest, I'm grateful for /a/ for making me do that, for "breaking that illusion" if you will.</br>  <br>i enjoy moeshit though.</br>  <br> What are "standards"? <br><br>What you lack.<br>Did you hit your head while you were a baby anon?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Please give an example of an objective standard of quality in literature that exists outside of subjective judgement.</br>  <br> all standars are created subjectively by beings. <br><br>It is subjective to a degree, but not entirely. So no, it's not true that there can't exist standards for storytelling in the same way that there exist standards for science, physics, and mathematics.<br><br>You're objectively poor taste is driving us in circles</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's simple. Depth doesn't sell. We have witnessed this over and over. What sells is mindless colorful zany shit. They know this, we know this. <br><br>It is not that they can't write good, deep plots. They purposely avoid doing so because it DOESN'T SELL.</br></br></br>  <br>Ok I cringed hard, good work.</br>  <br>Why?</br>  <br> You're <br> it's not true that there can't exist standards for storytelling in the same way that there exist standards for science, physics, and mathematics. <br><br>The difference is we're talking about standards of quality here which is complete different. Quality is based on subjective perception.</br></br></br></br>  <br>source?</br>  <br>Don Quixote<br>It masterfully represents the dangers of obsession and has a masterful prose. The character development as Quixote becomes sancho and sancho Quixote thought the books is subtle but effective.<br><br>Its a good book, even if you dont like it</br></br></br></br>   Mfw I recently discovered even live action shows for kids in Japan have more coherent writing than your standard seasonal anime   <br>we're all little girls here</br>  <br>To eloborate if there were objective standards of quality then someone could write the best possible story ever.<br><br>But what happens when someone believes a different story is better?<br><br><br>That's a book you're saying is good. Not a standard of quality. A standard of quality would be something like "more length = higher quality".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good question. It would take a long time trying to figure that out.<br><br>The short answer is that people are fucking stupid. Look at the best selling shit.<br><br>I'm not trying to be hipster, but stats don't lie. Deep shit just doesn't sell. There is a niche audience that digs it for sure, but big budget doesn't want niche. They want Idolmaster. They want Pokemon. They want cute girls. They want big robots. <br><br>If smart shit sold more than dumb shit, then we'd be seeing a lot more smart shit. It's common sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Im not saying its good.<br>The book is good period. I honestly didnt like it that much but you can still learn why its great and what it did for literature.</br></br>  <br>this<br>most people would rather avoid thinking/any effort if the thing they make is good enough to sell without any of it</br></br>  Are you guys stupid or do you really not understand what objective and subjective mean?  <br> mfw Kill la Kill's writing was such shit it's ending was stolen straight from OOOs </br>  <br> I'm actually more interested in understanding why some anime/manga fans genuinely think that said form of art is inherently or de facto inferior to books or tv series. <br><br>Unless there is something wrong with my reading comprehension, don't you mean that anime/manga fans think the art form is superior or to books or tv series? Everyone is aware of the superiority complex that these fans have.</br></br></br>  <br>You want an answer?<br>ITs because most people are not NEETS.<br>Most people have a life, a life full of problems and stress and whores <br>Life fucking sucks, Im a neet loser and even I know that for most people when they get a break they dont want to sunk into something deep<br>They want simple stuff to disconnect thats all.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most seasonal anime is made of adaptations and so is OP's example dumbass</br>  <br> if there were objective standards of quality <br>There must be. That is the design of reality. Some things are, and some things are not.<br><br> then someone could write the best possible story ever. <br>They could.<br><br> But what happens when someone believes a different story is better? <br>They, like you're waifu, would be in bad taste<br><br><br> Quality is based on subjective perception. <br><br>Again: to a degree yes, but not absolutely. So no, not really.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The book is good period <br>No it's only good based on certain standards of quality. Someone could think it's complete shit.</br></br>  <br>Why are you calling me a dumbass and proving my point at the same time?<br>The only anime that sell are the ones that have fans of the source material.</br></br>  <br>The truth is it's because those people are stupid.</br>  <br>Even if you think its shit its still good, you are just uninformed and dont know shit about literature.</br>  <br> Even if you think its shit its still good, you are just uninformed and dont know shit about literature <br>Literal hipster talk. A book's value is decided by the reader, not some fancy committee who sits with their egos up their asses.</br></br>  <br> The short answer is that people are fucking stupid <br><br>I think it also reflects on the state of humanity, how we relate to one another on an individual and social level, and how this structures and shapes the international financial system, and puts the individual in a situation where their survival is not guaranteed.<br><br>If we had some kind of effective socialism (preferably of the nationalized variety), we would see an entirely different culture form. People could literally afford to have better, more intelligent taste. Everything boils down to money in this world, because without money, you're pretty much fucked</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats wrong, they are fighting every day out there in the real world so I can live my neet life.<br>They just want to escape with stupid crap<br><br>If the whole world was some kind of dystopian society where no one had to work then youd see much more love for deep stuff</br></br></br></br>  <br> That is the design of reality. Some things are, and some things are not. <br>Quality is not something that exists in reality though. The argument that it does because human beings work a certain way is flawed because while human beings do have similarities, they generally work in very different ways from each other.</br></br>  I think you're expecting too much from cartoons targeted at teenagers.  <br>But muh mature anime for mature adults like me</br>  <br>There is no comitte, what the book did and is cannot be denied: its use of literaty techniques and story telling, its vocabulary etc<br>You are just ignorant</br></br>  <br>See <br>Someone else can't create standards for another person. It doesn't work that way. They could make a claim of value using their own standards and try to get the person to agree, but if they don't it doesn't make them wrong.</br></br>  <br>I think this is pretty damn accurate.</br>  <br>So you are telling me that fantasia´s animation os not better than any anime this season?<br><br>Im sorry but you are forever wrong you manchild<br><br>And just like animation can be good or bad so can writing</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Quality is not something that exists in reality though. <br> The argument that it does because human beings work a certain way is flawed because while human beings do have similarities, they generally work in very different ways from each other. <br><br>It it was true that individuality contravened functionality, it would have to be true absolutely. It is not true absolutely, so therefore it can only be absolutely untrue, and therefore objective quality entertainment must exist in some form.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This. Someone could say the best genre of movie is superhero movies because it inspired them and live up to their standards. However, someone who likes detective films could argue superhero films are trash because of their standards/taste in movies. In other words, all literature and art is subjective.</br>  <br>Another manchild<br><br>No they are not</br></br></br>  <br>Okay here we go. There's some standards of quality.<br><br>Literary techniques<br>Story telling<br>Vocabulary<br>Impact on RL<br><br>See the book is only good based on certain standards for these things. If someone reads the book and gives no shits about any of that, and just wants mechs, it's a shit book.<br><br>You're judging it based on subjective standards and saying that makes it objectively good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>Okay, but what about animation like Ping Pong or Tatami Galaxy? Some people could argue it's shit because they don't like the style, while others could praise it based on it's uniqueness and appeal to them. Don't try to impose your standards on others.</br>  <br>So a doodle by a 4yo can be better that a davinci?</br>  <br>I'm not sure to understand what you meant, and my english may be bad.<br>What I wanted to say is that lots of anime fans think that anime is inferior to other forms of entertainment.<br>They feel embarassed by the fact that they like it, not only because of how other people look at them, but also because they really think that their taste is inferior.<br><br>And so I wonder why it is so, since by my personal experience, I don't think that it is inferior.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes and that person is a shit eater and a philistine.</br>  <br> Davinci <br> Anything more than an overhyped artist for his time <br>Gr8 b8 m8</br></br></br>  <br>Your hypothesis is inherently flawed, because generally the dumbest people are the ones with the least amount of time. My step father is a professor at a renowned University. My father is a Pulmonologist. My mother is an accountant for billionaires. They come home at 6 pm each day. We have 5 houses and more cars than I can remember.<br><br>They don't watch dumb shit. My stepfather likes the Silmarillion and Star Treck. My father reads books that I can't even pronounce the names of. <br><br>I'm not telling you this to brag, I'm merely stating that dumb people like dumb things, and we have an abundance of dumb people in this world.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everything is relative. Stop oppressing those brilliant and creative individuals who's life choices scare you because you're a backwards bigoted oppressive shitlord.</br>  <br> objective quality entertainment must exist in some form <br>Well yes like I pointed out earlier in the thread if every conscious being that could understand something agreed that it was good, it would be objectively good.<br>That's just hard to achieve.<br><br><br>Based on certain subjective standards it is better. Based on a lot it's better. But there's probably someone who thinks differently and that doesn't make them wrong, because it's an opinion.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was not my point<br><br>Since art is subective I can draw a stick and consider myself the best artist ever right?<br><br>All of you just dont understand my genious</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes you could. And you wouldn't be wrong.<br><br>But I'm not sure what you're achieving if everyone else thinks you're wrong.</br></br></br>  <br>Or you have no standards and are a shit eater.<br>Because to have standards you need to love yourself and love art instead of just using it for masturbation purposes</br></br>  <br> y step father is a professor at a renowned University. My father is a Pulmonologist. My mother is an accountant for billionaires. They come home at 6 pm each day. We have 5 houses and more cars than I can remember. <br><br>And yet you're here in one of the most toxic places on the internet arguing about chinese cartoon standards. Something obviously went wrong somewhere.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought that you had made a mistake with your wording but that was not the case. Apologies on my part. <br><br>I understand fully what you are saying now and no, I don't think it is inferior either.</br></br></br>  <br><br>yeah, i find childrens art more interesting than da vinci, there a purity to a kids imagination that hasnt been corrupted by the constructs of art techniques.</br></br>  <br>Take a look at 4chan.<br>People flock to it for entertainment, so I'd say that it is more or less an entertainment media.<br><br>Now, by experience, or even looking at the current thread, do you think that coherent thinking is the most popular thing to write and read here? No. It's all about meme, shock value, porn and jokes.<br><br>It's not and has never been a problem which only pertains to anime.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mirai nikki and deadman wonderland are shounen targeted at boys under 14. That's not even a young adult demographic, which LN cover. Most of them have objectively shit writing though. <br>Anime adaptations are mostly a commercial for the original work anyways, so nobody should expect much.<br>LNs have shit writing because the industry is oversaturated and anybody can be a writer, there is a very low bar set for them. Not to mention its seen as disposable entertainment because of how cheap they are.<br><br>Legit novel adaptations happen sometimes, Shinsekai yori, vampire hunter D, Moribito, LoGH and Hyouka. You can tell how those are a league better than the LN and manga adaptations. But there are still some so-so works like Another or Mardock scramble.<br><br>Original anime hard to judge, most of the time it's hit or miss. But that goes for any medium.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didnt want to believe it but you nailed it.</br>  <br><br>Actually consider this. Take the reverse. You spend 0 effort and draw a shitty stick. Everyone in the world considers it the best thing ever but you think it's shit.<br><br>Are they wrong? Are you wrong?<br><br>It's fucking opinions man.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Well yes like I pointed out earlier in the thread if every conscious being that could understand something agreed that it was good, it would be objectively good. <br><br>You never responded to my counter to that. I'll repeat it:<br><br>The workings of reality are independent from beings' perception. Consensus doesn't prove truth, and neither does discord prove the opposite. Perception and reality are completely divorced most of the time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You lack the knowledge to appreciate good art.</br>  <br>From what I've seen, 4chan has a lot of richfags. Have you been in any battlestation threads?</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>Lost.<br><br>And the latter seasons of Heroes.</br></br></br>  It doesn't matter how good your writing is, if it isn't entertaining to the majority of people, its shit.  <br> Mirai nikki and deadman wonderland are shounen targeted at boys under 14. <br><br>Really? God, they're pretty violent and sexual for 12 year olds, don't you think?</br></br></br>  <br>Because most anime are for children and teenagers. They don´t care about writing. Hell even some adults don´t as long as the girls are hot.</br>  <br>How disappointed are they in you.</br>  The only real standards you can genuinely objectively judge writing on hinge on the logical coherence of its parts, the mechanical capability of the writer, and the literary standards currently established at the time. Even then, that last one is entirely subjective.<br><br>You can certainly shit on a piece of fiction without a doubt if there exists glaring plotholes, obvious inconsistencies within the story not , unrealistic dialogue utilized within the context of the scene, and whether the author's grasp on the language/grammar utilized is lacking. Aside from that, it's all unfortunately subjective for whatever fucking reason. Ah fuck. What does it matter? Just enjoy what you enjoy and stop acting like an insufferable cunt when somebody else likes something you don't.</br></br>  <br><br> Perception and reality are completely divorced most of the time. <br>Exactly. And quality is derived from individual perception like I said 10 posts ago.</br></br></br>  <br>Considering I'm about to graduate with a masters in CS, not very.</br>  <br><br>Egon Shiele, Lancer Freud, Basquiat, Kahlo, Harring, James Jean, Sachin Teng, Roberto Ferri and Beeple are a few of my favorite artists.<br><br>I think I know more about art than you, bud. :)</br></br></br></br>  <br>They would if they knew you watch degenerate cartoons from china</br>  <br>I still play pokemon all the time, I think anime is the least of their concerns.</br>  <br>Woah careful there with your fedora<br>Dont goo googling too many random names now</br></br>  <br> quality is derived from individual perception <br><br>Not necessarily, and not all the time. It can be said that one work is objectively inferior to another. I don't feel like I need to give examples, you should be able to conceptually see the truth in that statement.<br><br>So, like I also said earlier, if it is not true that individuality is the absolute source of function (in regards to entertainment), then it must be true that objective quality (like my waifu) exists in some form.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Just enjoy what you enjoy and stop acting like an insufferable cunt when somebody else likes something you don't. <br>The only thing that ever mattered.<br> Regardless, my taste &gt; your taste. </br></br></br>  <br>I don't think you really know what a 12 year old likes. Weren't you ever a preteen?</br>  <br>TV, video games, books</br>  <br><br>Says the guy who challenged my response to begin with. If you can't handle someone knowing their shit, then maybe you should shut your fucking mouth. Or in this case: typing at a keyboard. Have a great day. :)</br></br>  <br>Sadly capeshit is already the top tier of American entertainment</br>  <br>Deadman wonderland was too grotesque and vulgar for my liking as a 22 year old. While some kids might find that edgy and exciting, I struggle to imagine their intended audience, at least for DMWL, was really children. That seems too cynical for Japan.</br>  <br> It can be said that one work is objectively inferior to another. <br>Actually it can't that's the problem.<br><br> if it is not true that individuality is the absolute source of function <br>What do you mean function? Like entertainment value? Because that's is completely subjective.<br><br><br>Just looking up Beeple and one of the actual names I have no clue what you would search to find both of those. Stop being a faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What other entertainment media can get away with shoddy writing to the extent that anime regularly does? <br>Check out some soap-operas. My mom used to watch Days of our lives and they had aliens, hypnotic paint, exorcisms and shit like that.</br></br>  1. Anime is for children/otakus with little or no understanding of what objective qualities constitute good writing (not saying that writing quality overall is objective, just that it has many measurable elements.<br>2. Japanese business culture is pretty damn conservative and averse to risk-taking. Hence, the recycled tropes, plotlines, and character archetypes with no real attempt at differentiation.<br>3. Writing is way less important in animation than film, literature (duh), and arguably film, given the expense involved and the locked in product costs. You can't do multiple takes, rewrite on the fly with a half-completed episode done, etc.<br><br>These are the things I can think of off the top of my head.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I really don't think it costs that much to produce like 5 still frames or a second of animation.</br>  <br> Lain <br> Silmarillion <br> things done right </br></br></br>  <br> Implying that seriousness is a main factor of good writing. </br>  <br> &gt;It can be said that one work is objectively inferior to another. <br> Actually it can't that's the problem. <br><br>It can, and it's quite a simple concept. For example, a story that is not written is an objectively lesser story than one that is.<br><br> What do you mean function? Like entertainment value? Because that's is completely subjective. <br>Entertainment value would be a subjective function. The quality of that entertainment would be objective.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It really depends on what they're going for. If emotion, and expression in a character are important to the studio, a simple gesture of arms being raised could take a while. You have to keep in mind, that not only do they animate the linework, but the color pallete/shading as well. <br><br>I've tried my hand at animating too, and I can say it is a hair-pulling process that can take up so much of your time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some of those were decent, but shit like Thor 2 and Iron Man 3 made me give up on capeshit. Now they are rental only and I only watch them while drunk.</br>  <br>Just realized but didn't Anno just say "I chose it because it sounds complicated" because he didn't want to have to explain himself to a group of fucking children</br>  <br> he didn't want to have to explain himself to a group of fucking children <br><br>Nah, children are not so retarded that they can't conceive of "themes" or "messages" or "morals."<br><br> I chose the name because it hints at what I wanted the show to be about </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br> What other entertainment media <br>Pretty much anything.</br></br>  <br> For example, a story that is not written is an objectively lesser story than one that is <br>You can't compare a story that is written to one that isn't. That's not a comparison. It's not objectively better than the story that isn't written because there's nothing to be better than.<br> The quality of that entertainment would be objective. <br>No it would be subjective. If two people think considering it to be different quality who is right?</br></br></br></br>  I think what is consider shoddy or inconsistent is, in the end, a integral part of what many enjoy about anime because it caters to what the audiences expect. You cannot expect anime to cater of a certain "objective" quality some may want because there a many people that enjoy aspects of it anime that is not really great in that sense.<br><br>I am not saying this to insult viewers. The moment the medium as a whole becomes more highbrow in its writing it will inevitably create a different culture and audience in association and it will make the medium as a whole something completely different.</br></br>  <br>No, it's their stupidity which leads to a fucked up existence, because people are stupid and scared to live consciously and instead choose to fade away after slaving (or perhaps they fade as soon as they slave?) like you're saying.</br>  <br> That is not a comparison <br>Why not?<br><br> It's not objectively better than the story that isn't written because there's nothing to be better than. <br><br>It doesn't matter: A completed story is objectively better than a story that has only been written to the length of one half sentence.<br><br> If two people think considering it to be different quality who is right? <br>The one who has better taste is right, objectively</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Lelrial Experimemes Lame <br><br>Lain was utter garbage.<br><br><br> What other entertainment media can get away with shoddy writing to the extent that anime regularly does? <br><br>Literally any media can get away with it nowdays, especially movies</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Literally any media can get away with it nowdays, especially movies <br><br>Kingsman is the most recent example I could think of</br></br></br>  <br> What other entertainment media can get away with shoddy writing <br>all of them. tv often has shows that should have never made it to film. books are full of shitty writing and I need not say anything about songs</br></br>  <br>Well it's not that you aren't somparing two things, you just aren't comparing the quality of two things. You are comparing having something to not having something which is completely different.<br><br> A completed story is objectively better than a story that has only been written to the length of one half sentence. <br>Again we aren't comparing quality here. We are comparing existence.<br><br><br> The one who has better taste is right, objectively <br>Now what if someone with "objectively better taste" than that person agrees with the other person?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This<br>Didn´t a lot of people watch Evangelion for the girls when it was airing an Anno was mad that they didn´t care about the story but only for the girls?<br><br><br>Problem is we don´t need smart people in the world. At least not a lot of them. We need some smart and a lot of stupid people. <br>A smart person that could be a rocket scientist wouldn´t flip burgers at McDonalds or do some other shitty job. Because they know it´s under their standards and they could something different. If everyone was like that we would have a problem.<br>So yeah we need people who are ok with doing shitty work and are to stupid to do something different.<br>Brave New World in a nutshell<br><br><br><br>That justifies why people are stupid. But they are still stupid. <br>You say that because they have little time and problems they don´t want something deep and if they had time and no problems they would appreciate it. <br>Well since they don´t they are stupid.<br><br>That´s like saying well if I had more time and motivation to do sports I could be really athletic. It doesn´t change the fact that I´m a fat fuck.<br><br>Of course it´s ok if not everyone if going for the deep stuff, but if they just don´t care about it they are stupid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Egon Shitle, Kahlo <br><br>b8, b8, b8.<br>all constructed from a tad too degenerate freaks that got lucky a rich and influential degenerate freak took a liking to their degenerate art</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> hating Lain <br><br>MALplebs detected.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gil, please</br>  <br><br>people don't have to be rich in order to spend money on animu merch</br></br>  <br> Again we aren't comparing quality here. We are comparing existence <br><br>By what measure? A one sentence story is still a story. The point to see here is that if, like you say, existence and not perception determines quality under any circumstance, then it must not be subjective. It can't be both subjective and objective.</br></br></br>  <br>If people are willing to spend $400 on some discs or a designer toy, then they better have a big wallet or they are incurably retarded.</br>  <br> Americans won't like it if things don't make any sense. Japan doesn't seem to give one shit like this. <br>Then it stops being a case of "shit writing" doesn't it.</br></br>  <br> It´s funny because it´s true. </br>  <br> By what measure? A one sentence story is still a story. <br>Sorry I was still talking about the story that doesn't exist. If you are talking about a partially written story then you are using completion as a standard of quality.<br><br>Existance doesn't determine quality, it's just the quality of something that doesn't exist cannot be judged or compared, since there is nothing to judge or compare.<br><br>If someone prefers one sentence to a full story would they be wrong?<br><br>Also nice job not replying to the other part of my post.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> boshojo </br>  <br> :) <br>Fuck off back to tumblr</br></br>  Objectively superiour to your favourite book:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=yHM<wbr>RRmpI2xo</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>If completion is a prerequisite for comparison, that is objective.<br><br>For example, what if I perceive an uncompleted story to be superior to a well thought out, detailed character drama?

Let's assume for the sake of simplicity that it is incomplete in regards to its scope of introspection as well as its length, and that, additionally, its rival is equal to it in those regards, but is completed.

That's up to you to decide, saying that spending money on a car would be better just because it's a car is arbitrary.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Quality is not part of the laws of reality. Quality is subjectively applied based on individual judgement. <br><br>We've already established that quality can only exist in an objective framework of stipulations. Therefore it cannot be purely or essentially subjective.<br><br> Say person A has better taste than person B and person C has better taste than person A. A B and C all watch a series. B and C like it and A dislikes it. How can this be? <br><br>It is easily possible. Determining who has the best taste, if any of them can be said to have good taste, would depend on the series, and on their taste with other works in general.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you saying LoGH is worse than some stupid shit for kids? The existence of this show alone makes anime better than Western cartoons. It's why people prefer anime over it. There isn't anything like it in the West as an equivalent.</br>  <br> That's not even my disgusting post <br>I struggle to believe you.<br><br> bait <br> western 3dpd on /a/ <br><br>I think I have every right to be indignant, thank you very much.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, LOGH is worse than the shows I mentioned.</br>  <br>5000000 people think Attack on Titan is the best anime to come out of Japan in the last 50 years.<br><br>How can you say you have a better taste than such a large portion of people.<br><br>Give me a logical argument. You have 10 minutes.<br><br>Autism intensifying~~~~~~~~~~</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> We've already established that quality can only exist in an objective framework of stipulations. <br>Nope.<br><br>Assigning quality to something is a claim of value. If you don't know what that is here:<br><br> A Claim of Value is a form of persuasive rhetoric which argues that something has value, either morally or esthetically. It must be supported by referring to a known standard or by establishing an agreed-upon standard. <br> It must be supported by referring to a known standard or by establishing an agreed-upon standard. <br> known standard <br>There are no known objective standards for quality.<br> by establishing an agreed-upon standard <br>This is how most quality is assessed. It's not objective though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's why people prefer anime over it <br>They don't. Disney and Pixar are more popular than anime. Even in Japan (excluding Ghibli).</br></br>  <br> How can you say you have a better taste than such a large portion of people. <br>Because consensus doesn't prove or even really correlate with function.</br></br>  <br>I'm talking about the fans of anime, you autist. The existence of a few mature shows alone is one of the main reasons to prefer it over Western cartoons.</br>  <br><br>the best anime to come out in the last 50 years is Naruto. At least, compared to Attack on Titan.</br></br>  <br>Anime has no function. It's art.<br>Anime has no quality. It's art.<br><br>A quality is something you can empirically measure.<br><br>Quality is not a quality in itself.<br><br>Anime A has more characters than Anime B.<br>More characters is a quality.<br><br>Anime A is better than Anime B.<br>What is it better at?<br>Better is not a quality.<br><br>1 out of 3 tries.<br>You have 2 left. Carry on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> function <br>Quality isn't function though.<br>5000000 people wouldn't be wrong.<br>Anyone who things SnK is bad would also not be wrong.<br>Opinions cannot be wrong.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Waw<wbr>rfHBsCCA</wbr>  [ ]<br>It's amazing, bro!</br></br>  <br>That's a different meaning of quality from the one we've been talking about. A might have more characters on B but how does that affect the percieved quality (how good it is).<br><br>My argument is that it's purely subjective judgement of the observer. He says that there is an objective standard of quality built into reality.</br></br></br>  <br> there is no consensus on the matter, therefore reality must be this way or that way <br><br>This is an objectively untrue assertion, and doesn't refute my argument, which I will rephrase for simplicity's sake:<br><br>Taste (in regards to entertainment) cannot be entirely subjective because circumstances exist in which it can be objectively measured. Therefore the individual is objectively not the sole determining factor of quality, and therefore the laws of reality come into play at some point. In that sense of the laws of reality, there must then exist an objective measure of taste.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How can you say you have a better taste than such a large portion of people. <br><br>Because those people have no idea about the medium and are in no way thinking critical at all.<br>If they had more experience with anime they would understand that there is better stuff.<br>People who watched a lot of anime most likely if they say something is bad because they are better judges.<br>Of course everything depends on the point of view but saying someone who saw 20 anime is better at judging the quality of a show than someone who saw 200 is downright retarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Silmarillion <br> good </br></br>  <br>Nigga his post is art don´t critizise or try to prove him wrong.</br>  <br>Easy, western fantasy novels. The point is that the fun part is the themes and presentation, not the actual story. You can tell whatever retarded story you like, and as long as it at least looks good some subset of people will enjoy it</br>  <br> there is no consensus on the matter, therefore reality must be this way or that way <br>There is no consensus because it's all opinions. There is no right or wrong with opinions. Reality does not have to be this way or that way.<br><br> Taste (in regards to entertainment) cannot be entirely subjective because circumstances exist in which it can be objectively measured. <br>No it cannot. Please give an example if you think it can.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Anime has no function. <br>Objectively untrue. You should read that one book by U.G. Krishnamurti, about why there is no need for books.<br><br> Anime has no quality. <br>Therefore, also untrue.<br><br> It's art. <br>Semantics<br><br> More characters is a quality <br>More semantics. There is more than one definition for the word 'quality.'</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or in other words, this GRRRRR NO FUN ALLOWED attitude that infects "serious" literature is just another part of the cancer infecting modern society</br>  Here's what John Carpenter said about the state of the horror industry in an interview:<br> JC: Horror gets reinvented for every new generation. And I don't really think it's in trouble. I just think it's evolving. <br> Q: For better or for worse? <br> JC: Both. In the number of horror movies that are released each year, most of them... are bad. A very few of them are fair. And even fewer are good. That's always been that way. So there's nothing different. <br> [...] <br> JC: The problem with horror films and lots of projects that come out, is that there's just too many of them... and so many are crap. Such garbage! And everybody thinks they can make one. Everybody. Let's make a zombie movie. Really? Really, another one? You wanna make another movie? [...] Come on guys! How many times can you recycle George Romero's film, Night of the Living Dead? How many times does that happen? When is that gonna stop? The same movie, over and over. And now they move faster. OK. Great. It's the same stuff. It's on TV now, The Walking Dead. It's the same story! <br><br>The first part applies to all "entertainment media". The second part essentially applies to anime (and to specific movie genres, literature genres, video game genres).<br>Just try evolving your own taste and intellect for the better and choose shows accordingly. When a year yields an exceptional amount of good shows it's just a coincidence, and it's the same when it yields an exceptionally small amount.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Call me when the West manages to produce any animation like:<br><br> Tatami Galaxy <br> Haibane Renmei <br> LoGH <br> GiTS <br> Akira <br> Perfect Blue <br> Kaiji <br> Mushishi <br> etc <br><br>The few 'adult-oriented' animation that exists in the West is stupid toilet humor garbage. Anime is completely unique in this aspect.<br><br>Also, Ghibli is overrated.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Reality does not have to be this way or that way. <br>There is a structure (a way) of reality. Some things are, and some things are not. There is no arguing this.<br><br> &gt;Taste (in regards to entertainment) cannot be entirely subjective because circumstances exist in which it can be objectively measured. <br> No it cannot. Please give an example if you think it can. <br><br>We've been over this, but for example, take a story that is indecipherably incoherent and compare it to a story that is well written. If quality was subjective, it would be impossible to prove the superiority of the one over the other.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well if you think about the way animation is mainly perceived in the west if someone wanted to do a serious show aimed at an adult demographic it would never end up animated.</br>  <br>Good is not a quality.<br>It's a half of a dichotomy. It's most often used in a religious context.<br>What is good for you is bad for someone else.<br>Again completely unrelated concept you're trying to inject into art. Art is not a religion.<br><br><br>  better stuff. <br>Better is not a quality. Already covered that.<br>What is the other "stuff" better at?<br>Why? Do you have a logical argument to stand on?<br><br><br> Semantics <br>Fact. Quality used as a subjective attribute cannot be used as an argument.<br><br> why there is no need for books. <br>There is no need for books. There is no need for anything. Need is an abstract concept. It is completely subjective and again - not a logical argument.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but for example, take a story that is indecipherably incoherent and compare it to a story that is well written. <br> it would be impossible to prove the superiority of the one over the other. <br>You don't have much experience with postmodern literature, I see.</br></br></br>  <br>The West makes stuff like that, but it's all in live action. Are you allergic to live action stuff by any chance?</br>  <br>You're not even trying.<br><br>Can I take a guess that you dislike Ergo Proxy?</br></br></br>  <br> Some things are, and some things are not. <br>What is an opinion?<br>Is blue objectively better or worse than red?<br>No because judgements of quality like that are completely based on individual perception from conscious beings and are not built in to reality.<br><br> If quality was subjective, it would be impossible to prove the superiority of the one over the other. <br>That's the fucking point. You can't prove something is better than something else because quality is subjective. Also that doesn't prove quality is objective at all what is your point?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Good is not a quality. <br> It's a half of a dichotomy. It's most often used in a religious context. <br><br>What is with you and your semantics man fuck off. Words have multiple meanings. I hate how people use "edgy" nowadays but people understand what is meant when it is used.<br><br> Fact. Quality used as a subjective attribute cannot be used as an argument. <br>Well at least we agree on that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Regardless of its genre or trendiness, if one story is incoherent, it is objectively inferior to its coherent alternative.</br>  <br>Unless someone likes the incoherence and prefers it to the other story.<br><br>Quality is an opinion and is subjective.</br></br></br>  <br>No, they don't or they have ones that they keep running into the ground. Only few American shows are actually good and well written.</br>  <br><br> Quality used as a subjective attribute cannot be used as an argument. <br><br>Quality as an objective attribute can, though. That is what I'm doing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You have no logical arguments why should I try?<br>Try to do what?<br>You're giving elementary school level arguments.<br><br>You should probably learn how logic works before getting into an argument. And I seriously hope you're not STEM. This kind of stupidity can only be observed in English Lit majors.<br><br><br> Words have multiple meanings <br>You're using those words in a meaningless way.<br><br>You can say a movie has more plot devices than another movie.<br>You can't say a movie has more surprising twists.<br><br>These are arguments.<br><br>You could say a movie has a "better" plot, but that's not an argument. That's an opinion.<br><br><br>Quality is not a quality. Covered that.<br><br>3 strikes and you're out.<br><br>/thread</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Quality can't be an objective attribute though.<br>That's like saying an opinion can be objectively correct.<br>Actually it basically is saying that.</br></br></br>  You guys need to have more faith in your own taste. If you like and enjoy anime then it has to be good for something. If you watch a lot of anime then you must think anime is good, otherwise you wouldn't watch so much of it.  <br>Thatnks for not providing examples of what you think is 'good writing' v. 'bad writing' as this is very subjective.</br>  <br>I thought we were talking about animation? Why are you bringing a non-equivalent into the discussion?</br>  Todays buzzwords:<br><br>Quality<br>Art<br>Semantics<br>Subjective/Objective<br>Function<br>Autism <br>Opinions</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Unless someone likes the incoherence and prefers it to the other story. <br><br>Let's say that it is the same story, or two stories that are exactly equal in every way except for their coherence. That makes the comparison easier and simpler. One version of the story is incoherent to the extent of indecipherability. The other is coherent.<br><br>If one has a preference for incoherence, that does not change that version's inferiority as a story, according to the function of what a story is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's unfortunately not that simple IRL, son.<br>You ever heard of Finnegan's Wake?<br><br>Also postmodern lit as a genre literally runs on (not in all cases but in most) the fact that it is allowed to be incoherent and nonsensical. So the "regardless of its genre" part flies out of the window.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is very, very true. <br><br>What kills is me is when people try to convince me that it's somehow more 'adult' than anime and manga. <br><br>No, just no.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> You can say a movie has more plot devices than another movie. <br> You can't say a movie has more surprising twists. <br> These are arguments. <br> You could say a movie has a "better" plot, but that's not an argument. That's an opinion. <br>See this is the problem. My whole argument is that saying a movie has a "better" plot is an opinion. But he's saying there's an objective standard for "better" built into reality, even if it is unknowable and pointless to discuss.<br><br>How "good" it is was an example for what we mean by "quality".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> muh relativism <br> Check Mate </br></br>  <br>American markets mainly cater to white people.

What about that is so hard to wrap your head around?</br>  <br> Why not? <br>Give an example where you can use quality - which cannot be replaced with a much more precise word to define an attribute of an object.</br></br>  <br> So the "regardless of its genre" part flies out of the window. <br><br>In an absolute sense, the genre of a work is irrelevant to its function as a story, so that can't be used to justify a work which intentionally limits its functionality. I.e. It is bad taste to be edgy.</br></br></br>  <br>A large portion of that could be due to the fact that they make anime/movie/tv adaptions of manga. If America did more of that the American comic industry might sell a little bit better.</br>  <br> But the white Americans producing this shit are catering to other white Americans.  <br><br>I don't think you realize how multicolored the entertainment industry has become in America.</br></br></br>  <br>If someone doesn't like it then they would have 'bad taste'then, right?</br>  <br>He's going to say that quality is an attribute and can be measured. even if humans cannot understand how that is.</br>  <br> Yes because if it can be correct or incorrect it isn't an opinion, it's a fact. <br>Meaningless semantics</br></br>  <br>I listed TV series, OVAs and movies, anon. Short films are not an equivalent to that. Japan has a pretty huge market on that too. I loved La Maison en Petits Cubes btw.</br>  <br>Edgy is not a genre.

The people on top still have the biggest say in what gets produced and why. Did you not read or hear about any of the SONY emails that were released? Did you not hear about how they cast a white woman for a role where she had to be mixed with Asian and white? Did you not see what happened to Avatar: The Last Airbender? Even though the director was Indian-American, the casting choice was still catering to white people. <br><br>No matter how colorful the people working in Hollywood the top is still only made up of one color: white.</br></br></br>  Autism - the thread  <br> Obama <br>Checkmate Atheists</br></br>  <br>It's actually ADD. <br>Autistics understand logic.<br>I wish we could keep the autistics in the board but get rid of all the assburgers.</br></br></br>  Mostly the only things cited in this thread as being 'good'writing is anything done by white Europeans and Americans. Basically, the question here is:<br><br>Why can't the Japanese write more like white Westerners?<br><br>That's what this boils down to. Works by white westerners cater to other white westerners, just as Japanese works cater to Japanese people. I'm not saying that anime is the pinnacle of writing or anything, but it's like...just because it doesn't cater to you doesn't mean it's 'bad.' Though, it also goes to show that 'good writing' is subjective as many people in this thread have said.</br></br></br></br>  <br> it also goes to show that 'good writing' is subjective as many people in this thread have said. <br>No 'good writing' is determined by objective standards built into reality.</br></br>  <br> Zaimokuza <br>kek, pretty much.

It also has a 33% on rotten tomatoes based on viewer AND critic ratings.<br><br>The rights have been secured, script has been written, and the filming started in February of this year; with the movie slated to release late next year. So, the only thing that we CAN do is not go see it so that it becomes a complete flop and Hollywood leaves future adaptations or continuations alone because it assumes that it was not a good investment in the first place.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>Well shit, you've got a point. I'm just so tired of seeing the shit that is churned out nowadays, the fact that so many stupid people eat it up, and the fact that unless they get a really good director these assholes don't even do a half-assed adaptation of whatever source material they use, and that goes for anything; not just anime or manga. I guess what this boils down to is personal army faggotry without even intending to make such a request.<br><br>My point is that unless someone takes a stand at some point and forces these people to cease this endless bullshit, we're going to be surrounded by more brain-dead assholes than there already are (did I say that right? It's about midnight and it's been 100 degrees out, not firing on all eight). For the people who actually give a damn and need some sort of escape, everything that we call "entertainment" isn't going to be worth seeing, reading, or listening to. I'm just tired of the defeatist attitude taken towards projects like this; they CAN be a success if the right people are involved... but that's just my opinion.</br></br></br>  <br> ScarJo was chosen because she can do action and is probably one of the better actors among the attractive female actresses in Hollywood. <br><br>Oh that's fucking rich. She was chosen because she's popular right now. Her acting is okay at best and her action scenes are also okay at best.<br><br>We all know this is going to be a shitty "we need to stop the hacker before he finds the .txt file containing the whole worlds nuclear launch codes." sorta movie with maybe just the tinniest amount of transhumanism thrown in by accident.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her deciding to get a nose job was like, the best decision ever though.</br>  <br>I'd like to see a proper Appleseed adaption. Not more shitty CG movies, not another low budget OVA, a proper goddamn adaption.</br>   mfw normies start trying to talk about GitS near me   <br>Never going to happen after all these years. Might as well wish for Shirow to give up drawing shiny girl porn and finish the series from where he left off when the Kobe earthquake happened.</br>  <br><br>she's plenty hot but can't act for shit.<br><br>plus you know they're just gonna Whedon up her motoko becuase of Black widow</br></br></br></br>  She was well cast in the role.  <br>You know, Deaunan and Bri's relationship raises some questions I don't think I want answered.</br>  <br><br>He has a penis and it's huge</br></br>  <br>I was more meaning the direct size difference. He's practically a Landmate, she's a fairly normal human.</br>  <br> why not protest this shit? <br>Only in America do teenagers think protesting a Hollywood adaptation of an anime is something worth effort and time. How's your healthcare system working out? How about those cops of your shooting everyone? What about the lack of jobs in your economy? Forget that, protest muh animes!</br></br>  <br><br>she's a flexible girl</br></br>  Not like this year's animated movie will be any different.<br><br>After all, it's the same staff as ARISE, with Tow Ubukata writing it. They haven't learned their lesson at all.</br></br>  <br>  but why not protest this shit? <br><br>Because freedom of expression is a thing and regardless of whetether or not I think the movie will be good ( I don't ) It is well within the producers rights to make this <br><br>I will vote with my wallet and not see the movie in theaters in hopes that it bombs but I will not silence someones freedom of artistic expression simply because I don't like the casting choice <br><br>also you're an idiot</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ghost In The Shell wasn't all that great to begin with. Typical Shirow mystical technobabble that starts great and promptly goes nowhere.  <br>There's still some fundamental logistical issues that I'm sure Shirow has spent a worrying amount of time solving.<br>Maybe that's the reason he dropped Appleseed, after the earthquake he lost his notes on the physical side of their relationship.</br></br>  <br><br>eh Arise is alright, not great but hardly offensive unless you're some SAC baby eager to bitch about the new kid <br><br><br><br>Oshi is the one who made it what it was</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did they actually have a physical relationship? They were definitely close but there was nothing beyond some implied romance in the past.</br>  <br>See also every Ore Monogatari thread.</br>  <br> Did they actually have a physical relationship? <br><br>Yep. He fucked her till she couldn't walk</br></br></br>  <br> Oshi is the one who made it what it was <br>You mean take nice character designs and make them fucking ugly? Because Makoto looks like ass in the GITS movie.</br></br>  <br> but there was nothing beyond some implied romance in the past <br>Did we read the same manga? Honest question, I'm not sure how else it's possible you could've missed their ongoing relationship.</br></br>  <br>Huh, it's been a while. I guess I don't recall that.<br><br><br> Oshi <br>Except his movie is probably the worst adaptation. Stand Alone Complex is way better.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I want to kill everyone that unironically uses the phrase scarjoe.</br></br>  <br>One of the few cases where the anime adaptations improved on the original manga.</br>  <br>Deunan and Bri was very much an ongoing thing. I think the first of the movies fucked with it a bit but that's not really relevant.</br>  <br>I hate to use the word 'progressive', but the protagonists of Appleseed are pretty damn progressive for an 80's manga. Also interesting how Shirow specifically aimed to avoid the whole 'Japan is the centre of the world' thing that most of their media goes for.</br>  <br>nothing wrong with an adaptation, though 90% of them are terrible, problem is the director and all surrounding the project...<br><br>probably is going to be like that terrible ScaJo movie where she got those drugs and became a god</br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't watch it then.<br><br>The only thing we can do is vote with our wallets, flood crappy negative reviews, and do everything to make it as unattractive to normies as possible.</br></br></br></br>  <br> she can do action <br>I'm pretty sure it's just all stunt doubles.</br></br>  <br>Can you slowpoke ANY more? Like learning now they're making a DBZ live action with Justin something.<br><br> had </br></br></br>    <br>You mean they don't already? GitS a fairly mainstream thing.</br>  Just wait until the normies find the GitS sequel manga with the shiny girl rape scene.  <br>EWW</br>  <br>It was. It hasn't been for a long time. We aren't in 2005 anymore.</br>  <br> Toy Story 4 <br>but why</br></br>  <br>MONEY</br>  <br>Shirow's girls were far more attractive before they were made of grease.</br>  Can't be worse than Arise  <br>I think they're taking that as a challenge.</br>  <br>From the director of Snow White and the Huntsman. I'm not a betting man but I think it will be.</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>why cant it be her?<br>i mean she practically killed it in edge of tommorow</br></br>   The Jews are gonna butcher ghost in the shell and there is nothing you can do about it.   <br>That's a good question. It would have to be a more rugged Major than usual, but at least she'd be playing an actual Major.</br>  This is written by a guy whose writing credits are an NBC superhero show that got canned after 3 episodes and shitty movie about a con-artist.  /a/, would You suck on an ice cube after it has been inside a marshmallow's mouth?<br><br>Orrrr, would You smack them with the paper fan?</br></br>  <br>i dont know, but i would report someone to the police for being a pedophile.</br>  ....I would.  <br>The police wouldn't care.</br>  I'd suck on an ice cube while it's still inside a marshmallow's mouth.  Does /a/ like NTR?  I like everything as long as the art is good.  I love it for a variety of reasons... in theory.<br><br>In practice almost no one has the balls to make a proper NTR that actually builds emotional investment in the reader by starting as vanilla.<br><br>But man, considering how popular it seems to be, it's really weird that more haremshit eromanga don't have at least one heroine NTRed away from the protagonist.</br></br></br></br>  I like anything as long as the boys are good.  I like everything as long as the cocks are detailed and there's plenty of cross-section images and hefty amounts of semen.  I wouldn't mind if it weren't for the disgusting fat hairy old men.  Most NTR dumbs down the characters too much for me to rage. But yes, I do enjoy some NTR once in a while.  Absolutely patrician taste.  I don't care much about NTR, if it's hot I'll fap to it and that's it.<br><br>I like humiliation, and since most NTR are tied to the girl being degraded it's boner fuel, but I don't care about cheating or all that stuff,  I always selfinsert as the girl .</br></br>  Generally yes.  <br> In practice almost no one has the balls to make a proper NTR that actually builds emotional investment in the reader by starting as vanilla. <br>Look at this anon talking out of his ass.<br><br>You should read more of Seme Danjous stuff.</br></br></br></br>  Depends on the scenario. Most are just pure shit.  <br>I wish I could read moonrune anon. But then again most of seme's works arent scanned  at least on panda </br>  I like cheating when it's about women becoming slaves to the D, but NTR is designed around humiliating the male, and that's just a complete turn off.<br><br>It doesn't help that NTR is bottom of the barrel in terms of writing. It's hilariously bad even by hentai standards.</br></br>  NTR and cheating are the only things I fap to, so I suppose so.<br><br>I just get off much easier when I see women, especially milfs with children, being sluts and cheating, fucking other guys while wearing wedding bands and things. Even better if the husband ISN'T on a perpetual business trip and she still acts all lovey dovey with him. NTR impregnation and the woman passing it off as her husband's child is the most satisfying ending to an NTR story for me, especially if it also includes pregnant sex. <br><br>That being said, pregnant sex where it is the husband's child but a stranger is fucking her while she's carrying is THE ultimate turn on for me. Sure, the husband technically wins since it is in fact his child, but part of me thinks "When that child is born, their mother will have had sex with a man that isn't their father while heavily pregnant behind their father's back, what a slut" and other things like that, which further fuels my boner.<br><br>What's also good is when a milf goes into love hotels with another guy, but that doesn't really happen as often as I'd like. It happened in that one film, Colorful, which got me hard as fuck.<br><br>A few of my favourites are (I don't know if panda links are allowed outside panda threads)<br>http://exhentai.org/g/753523/5c197a<wbr>b7a8/ (just the first parts)<br>http://exhentai.org/g/785414/5318e1<wbr>4775/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/824191/bb6874<wbr>cf72/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/717541/d6452b<wbr>4182/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/431968/0a4595<wbr>4112/ (the entire series is nice)<br>There are too many to links to post for this but the Ane/Kaya-nee series from Kon-Kit<br>A lot of Aoi Hitori's works<br>http://exhentai.org/g/623373/20e153<wbr>c8e5/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/800587/466688<wbr>daa7/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/777058/5fd155<wbr>af84/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/798801/b2b450<wbr>2225/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/822389/56308c<wbr>70fb/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/824799/fece8e<wbr>37ae/<br>Most Takasugi Kou works (helps that I have somehwat of an oedipus complex)<br>Netoraserare is quite good in my opinion too</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Character limit reached, but my obsession with cheating and NTR has gotten to the point that I can't help but see it in nearly every anime I watch these days. Whenever there's a mother that's going out, or the MC leaves the house and his mother's alone I can't help but think "It'd be so hot if she calls over her fuckbuddy and has messy, sloppy sex while he's out", and I always automatically assume, and hope for, a twist where the MC finds out his wife/his mother/girlfriend is cheating. NTR and cheating has taken hold of my life and I can't stop fapping.</br>  Hana hook has some good stuffs. Too bad he seems to write repeatative shit.  <br>I feel the exact same thing, except I hate NTR.</br>  <br>Tachibana was my first experience with NTR.

I am not necessary looking for ntr but I like to know that main girl is being fucked by other guys to wether it's controversal or not.

She is slender, refined, pure, elegant, and truly what a human woman should be in anyway.<br><br>Then you have the hulking Beast Nigger...

When the beast acts on his primal urge and takes our elegant beauty's humanity away with rape... When that animal's big, slinky black cock forces its way in and out of that tight, previously pure white pussy over and over, utterly defiling her, conquering her, and claiming her as his... When that fucking Nigger sows his seed in her fertile white womb as she pleads with him not to, forcing her the utmost humiliation of raising a half-breed fucking animal beast like himself...<br><br><br>Is there truly ANYTHING hotter than that?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yes<br> Having sex with a girl in the missionary position with the lights of for the sole purpose to reproduction </br>    <br>As a black man I have to ask:<br>Why does it always have to be about race with you whites?</br></br>  <br>Yes.<br>All that but with pigmen.</br></br>  <br>That faggot may prefer niggers, but I prefer huge fucking humanoid animals. <br>There's nothing hotter than seeing that stomach bulge.</br></br>  Not until I started self-inserting as the girl.  <br>Taking a break from shitposting on /pol/, Chaim?</br>  <br>It's good, there's nothing to be ashamed.</br>  <br>This is fucking amazing, thank you.</br>  <br>Because blacks are inhuman to them.<br>Imagine if you replaced that 'black man' with a 6 back alpha gangster male.

And then of course the wife ends up mindbroken and the bitch sister ends up pregnant, and the husband comes home every day to see his wife get fucked by the boyfriend in their apartment.</br>  <br> furry tier <br>Its way lower than furry to me.

Half the time you are going to hear/read something which leaves out the rest of the statement due to an assumed understanding with the listener, if it is dialogue based.

It's a nasal vowel, meaning it comes through your nose rather than your mouth. <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan<wbr>ese_phonology#The_moraic_nasal_.2F.<wbr>C9.B4.2F<br><br>There's the wikipedia article, though it's not terribly technical either.

I plan on eventually doing one for DI, Muramasa, Mahoyo and probably KKK, Baldr and Soushuu. This won't happen for a while though, since I'm clearly not skillful enough to even attempt most of these games at the moment.<br><br>The merit of having a frequency list set up implies that you won't add any of the words that only appears once per say (most of which are either made-up words or ones that are generally useless outside the game they come from). This also saves you the need to mine words while you are actually playing. I'll update you guys on how useful it is.</br></br></br>  Can someone explain だろうと in this instance?  <br>When と is alone like that, it usually is short for と思う (in this case と思った)</br>  <br>No, it's "even if". It's like であっても. I'm having trouble finding an easy resource to link but here's a chunk from a research paper I found on google.<br><br>https://glim-re.glim.gakushuin.ac.j<wbr>p/bitstream/10959/2000/1/daigakuinn<wbr>ihongo_5_82_95.pdf</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>And if you're curious about how it differs from the similar ~だろうが, http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.j<wbr>p/qa/question_detail/q1297282852 has some discussion on that matter.</wbr></br>  <br>I passed the N2 when I was at 4500/6000. My score wasn't great, but it's definitely possible.</br>  <br><br>That certainly fits a lot better. I got the context wrong. Still だろうと meaning だろうと思う is valid in some contexts (certainly not this one).</br></br>  Im not sure this is correct,is it? Pretty specific.  <br>I mean, 同士討ち is friendly fire so it's not unreasonable. That said, basically every result I get from googling it is for Japanese English translation dictionaries. It's probably a random word that was used once and got recorded.</br>   what're you reading? <br><br>Shit, that was so un-understandable I thought it wasn't even real Japanese. I've never seen なせば at the start of a sentence</br></br>  <br>It's not a very common verb in general except in 為せば成る.</br>  <br>Why do reaction images give me the urge to play the games their from? I have a feeling this won't be good, either.<br><br>I guess it's better than shitposting on /a/ though.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Interesting.</br></br>  Just got home from work.<br>Time for niconico douga shenanigans for that istening and production practice.</br>  「いけない」と「ならない」では、前者の「いけない」が「～しないべきであ<wbr>る」「～しない必要がある」という意味に近く、また「そうしないと結果とし<wbr>て自分や他人に不利益がある」といった、ある種相対的なニュアンスが感じら<wbr>れます。一方「ならない」は「～しないのは義務である」という意味に近く、<wbr>自分や他人の利益・不利益とは関係なく、より絶対的な強制力や拘束力のある<wbr>表現になっています。<br><br>　したがって法律文などでは「～ならない」のほうが「～いけない」よりも使<wbr>用される傾向があると考えられます。<br><br>Interesting stuff. Why aren't you reading about grammar in Japanese, DJT?</br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>  <br>Because I don't need to study grammar</br>  <br>Is there a company I can just throw money at, and they send me phonebook mangas on a regular schedule without me having to do anything?</br>  <br>Reading about grammar makes me conscious of it.

The guy is a progressing mental case.</br>  <br>In a shit stained alleyway beside a motorcycle?</br>  what's up with this guy  Egao &gt; Food  <br> Implying it's not Yuzu who'll rip his clothes apart and fuck him senseless </br>  <br>No idea, but I've seen that haircut IRL and it doesn't look anywhere near as cool.</br>  <br>Average Synchro nutjob.</br>  <br>His hair is shaved to look like a lizard, I'm guessing he runs reptiles.</br>  <br>Ruri &gt; Egao</br>  <br>We won't get a hug, but if we don't get a tearful reunion I'll drop Arc-V.<br><br>Until the next episode started.</br></br></br>  <br>His hallucination was in the way and he didn't see them</br>  <br>Kids show anon</br>  <br>The egao induced  synchro nized fucking will be like two torrential fire hoses wrapped around an atom bomb.</br>  Can a battle hardened warrior ever find true love?  <br>I dunno, ask this guy</br>  <br>Yuya, what the fuck are you doing,man?</br>  <br>He can't even find the right Ruri</br>  <br>Cleaning his room, why don't you clean your room? Are you a slob?</br>  <br><br><br>Rebecca kissed Yugi once, on the cheek.<br><br>If Yuzu did this to Yuya the tomato will explode and spurt out all its delicious juices</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But those are girls clothes.</br>  <br>I think we were hoping for the lips at some point</br>  <br>;^)</br>  <br>Best you're gonna get is a hug with both of them smiling.</br>  <br> 5Ds as it was aired on Fusion <br> Fusion is the lewdest Dimension <br> Zexal actually ended on Yuma orgasming </br></br></br>  <br>But I want to see them  fist fight </br>    <br>A kiss to the lips really did happen in YGO series. Just that, it's two adults doing it, not 14 year olds.</br>  <br>Aww, that is sweeter than a sugar flavored milkshake sprinkled with cocaine.</br>  <br>Fuck you Charlie.</br>  Is this a new Underworld Troupe monster? The hell is this thing?  <br>So did Jack and Carly. That obviously was a kiss.</br>  <br> Fedora </br>  <br>Two adults, sure, but with the female being the daughter of the male's upperclassman makes it a little bit creepy.</br>  <br>They butted heads because their feelings are mutual.<br>Jack went on to bang that blue haired chick.</br></br>    <br>It could be an Entermage. Bennis tried to captu- I mean, rescue Selena from Roger, he might get into deep shit for that.</br>  <br> Jack went on to bang that blue haired chick. <br> Jack <br> Caring about women past episode 64 <br><br>No</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be honest, I just posted the picture without watching Zexal. I just happened to find that thing after searching about this .<br>.</br></br>  <br>Mikage? Hell yeah, I liked her.</br>  <br>Jesus christ Yuya</br>  <br>Wait, there are episodes past 64?</br>  <br>Shun found true love 14 years ago.</br>  How deep in Yuzu will Yuya come inside once they reunite?  <br>I bet he never saw Yuzu so defenseless like this.</br>  <br>not outside of doujins</br>  <br>You can't truly comprehend his cravings unless you see how his eyes go all shaky.</br>  <br>Out of her throat</br>  <br>At least in the appendix, or liver.</br>  <br>Jesus, his eyes are so shaky it's like their alcoholic or something.<br>Get those eyes off the sauce, Yuya.</br></br>  Does Yuya understand Yuto and Yugo better now that he lost his Ruri?  <br>D-different tubes, man. Unless it's anal.</br>  <br> Out of her throat <br>But that's not the right...oh, that hard huh?</br></br>  Reminder that Yuya and Yuzu are completely fucked, and that the tragedy has only just begun  <br>Yuto and Yugo don't trip balls and see their waifus in common scenery. <br>He's almost half as bad as Shun already.</br></br>  Have Yuya ever seen Yuzu blush like this?<br><br>I bet he never made jokes implying anything about her physique, that pussy.</br></br>  <br>How do you know Yuto didn't suffer from that? We never saw shit from his PoV apart from that flashback where he fought Yugo</br>  <br>I think it's a Underworld Troupe, since next scene we see it falling down on Sawatari.</br>  <br>FUCKING CHAD GET AWAY FROM MY YUZU REEEEEEEEEEE</br>  <br>Ah. Right.</br>  <br>Yuya isn't a dumbass who would say that so no</br>  <br>Everything will go as predicted.</br>  <br> Episode 7 <br> Now to get to LD-RURI? <br> Stop it, Yuto, your mind is playing tricks again <br> That's not Ruri, that's just your imagination <br> Why is my imagination of Ruri going up against that rich bastard? <br> Wait </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Those poor people who didn't grab it from the mega.  This fucking episode  <br> Hippo: the Episode <br><br>he's getting carded soon, isn't he</br></br></br>  <br> tfw when Mieru was right and Yuya is her chosen person and will be hers eventually. </br>  <br><br> Yuya encounters Yuzu for the first time in two months <br> Charges like a bull out a cage <br> In seconds their clothes are shreds <br> Slams it in her like a nail through a plank <br> Averaging 190 thrusts per minute  <br> Doesn't make it that long <br> Propels semen like a napalm strike <br> Jizz erupts out of her every orifice <br> Torrents of love juice surges twenty feet into the air in all directions  <br> 'I believe I can fly' is playing in the distance  <br> Yuzu says "Thankyou" <br> They were in the middle of Academia  <br> There was a war going on around them <br> People saw <br> Shun starts to clap </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> carding a card <br>Well that's all kinds of silly.</br></br>  <br>She'll win the Silver Medal and become a glorified womb while Yuya broods about his lost Yuzu.</br>  <br> Yuya didn't say "I'm cumming!" <br> He says "we're cumming!" <br><br>alternatively, three different voices say "I'm cumming!"</br></br></br></br>  <br> Battle Phase, ojou-san. <br>'Yuya is love, Yuya is life' edit when?</br></br>  <br> the war stops as everybody watches <br>I doubt Yuya is that sexual that he would want to do lewd things to Yuzu.</br></br>  <br>She's getting with this guy and you know it.</br>  <br>Yuya isn't, but Yuya who've absorbed the far lewder Yugo is.<br><br><br> Yuya absorbs Yugo <br> Debauched Yuya is the new super form <br> Works on any gender <br> This is why he's also so very cute </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>man who would have guessed than punching people was a faster way to get past them than dueling.</br>  <br> Hippo will get carded </br>  <br>Can somebody translate what Yugo actually said? It sounded to me like he was merely stating that Yuzu could wear Rin's clothes since they have the same size, or am I wrong?</br>  <br> No Set Face Down joke <br><br>Come on, writes itself.</br></br></br>  <br>If you think that's racy, just wait until he absorbs Yuri<br> MAXIMUM OVERLEWD </br></br>  <br> Yuto makes Yuya apeshit <br> Yugo makes Yuya sleazy <br> Yuri makes Yuya   depressed because he's secretly very ashamed of the horrible things that he does and wishes there was some way he could reform and go back to being the class clown </br></br></br>  <br>Yup. That's right. That's exactly what he said.</br>  <br> yfw absorbing Yuri makes him a mega sweet-tooth like Sora and Selena are <br> yfw Yuri-infused Yuya hopped up on sugar </br></br>  <br>Hang on, when has Selena been a sweet tooth?</br>  <br><br>If Yuzu also have to absorb her other Yuzus, I wonder what personalities will appear.<br><br>Absorbing Rin would just make her more motherly? Absorbing Serena would make her more crude?</br></br></br></br>  <br> will be hers eventually. <br>He won't.<br>And because of that he will suffer. He igrored his fate,</br></br></br>   Once per turn, during either player's Main Phase: The turn player can target 1 monster they control; place that target underneath this card, also destroy all other monsters they control. While this card is on the field, the turn player draws 1 additional card for their normal draw during their Draw Phase for each of their monsters underneath this card. <br>What a weird effect.</br>  <br> Yuri feels depressed because there's this intense craving in the bottom of his heart that he can't get rid of <br> It's as if an important part of him has been removed <br> This mysterious pain is only relieved when he's on the mission to kidnap Rin and Ruri <br> For some reason, he wanted to get really close to these girls <br> he wanted to touch them, he wanted to talk to them <br> As if he wanted to return to a...better time? <br> What better time? <br> He had always been the Professor's loyal soldier, hadn't he? <br> Hadn't he? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> yfw, there will be another card that will allow to treat it like an Xyz monster </br>  <br>He's not exactly loyal according to a past magazine scan. The only reason he's working for the Professor is because it's fun.<br><br>He'll betray him the moment he finds things boring.</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit, I hope Yuri is this complex.<br>It pains me to know he'll just be a generic sadist.</br></br>  <br>ah fuck, my fanfic!</br>  <br> he wanted to touch them </br>  <br>It reminds me about this.</br>  <br>Sure.</br>  <br>Yuri is a sadist because he's a Yuya without a Yuzu, raised by an Akaba.<br><br>That'll wreck someone.</br></br></br>   One of Dennis' goals was to take Serena back to Academia <br> Finds Serena alone <br> She doesn't have her duel disk <br> He won't be able to take such a perfect opportunity <br>If I was Dennis, I would be annoyed.</br></br></br></br>     Cross-Over again <br>Oh come on, you've been using that damn field since getting to Synchro. I know this technically is a crossover and all but that's no reason to just spawn generic blue platforms every time.</br>  <br>Very annoyed. Restraining such a furious boner must be impossible.</br>  <br>It's probably the only environment they can produce given the small range of the generators in their disks.</br>  <br>It's because of their shit Duel Disks not working as well in Synchro as they do in Standard.</br>  <br>Dennis has a dick like a crayon. <br>Why do you think he's so loud and outgoing?</br></br>  <br>I think that's the only one they have. <br><br>Also it helps the writers by not having to draw a new background all the time</br></br></br>  <br>He wanted that Ruri.</br>  <br> the writers by not having to draw a new background all the time <br>arc-v is weird like that, making the writers draw and the artists write.</br></br>  <br>It lets them save some budget for Shun doing punching.</br>   Inb4 Yuzu's new appearance keeps her hair down    The hidden dimension theory   <br>You mean animators.<br><br>That's kinda true though, considering Synchro Dimension really has an expressive background compared to Standard.</br></br></br>  <br>I laughed so hard I think I pissed myself</br>  <br> Yuzu with her hair down wearing a helmet <br> Yuya didn't notice <br>I'd be angry. Angry enough to whine on the internet!</br></br></br>  <br>When does GX plot actually start?</br>  <br>Rituals had to come from somewhere right? R-right!?<br>It's totally an independent method deserving of its own universe y-you guys!</br></br>  <br>The hell was this</br>  <br><br>Yes I meant animators</br></br>  <br>Oh fuck you,anon.</br>  <br>Uhm... plot?</br>  <br>120 episodes in.</br>  <br>He's joking.</br>  I've been enjoying this guy way too much since he got fun again.<br> He's going to die/get carded and we'll never get his archetype </br>  <br>I think he'll stick with them to spectate the tournament before dying</br>  So far we have Hiragi Yuzu, Kurosaki Ruri, and Streetratsdonthavenames Rin.<br>What is Selena's surname?</br>  Oh at least get the right one Sawatari  <br> Kurosaki Ruri <br>That sounds... odd.</br></br>  <br>Test tubes don't have names.</br>  <br><br>Kurosaki Yuzu from bleach top kek</br></br>  <br>That face is utter perfection. We could shop any douchey card on there and it would be glorious.</br>  When Fusion will invade the Synchro there will be  ENJOY vs TENJOIN.   <br> Kurosaki Yuzu from bleach top kek <br><br>Bullshit. Stop stealing Ruri's shun, there's no such thing as a Yuzu Kurosaki</br></br></br>  <br> yfw Yuto's surname is revealed to be   Sakaki </br>  <br>http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/Yuzu_K<wbr>urosaki</wbr></br>  <br>Obviously Tsukino.</br>  <br>Fucking Sawatari, I bet that's how he's getting his Synchro monsters.</br>  h-hey guys am i cool now  So Chitoge won?  <br><br>Are you an animeonlyfag?</br></br>  Nobody is even remotely close to winning in the manga and it makes me fucking sad.  <br> lets reuse that exact look we made for sasami-san for this scene </br>  When exactly did the manga enter the cashcow status?  worst girl always wins<br><br>so yes</br></br>  The only winners when it comes to Nisekoi are those that dropped it half an episode in and never thought about it again  <br>The only true winners are the ones who read the one shot while staying away from the serialization and adaptation. It actually was a good one shot.</br>  <br><br>you're kidding yourself if you don't think everything is currently lined up perfectly for Chitoge. there's literally no chance of it being anyone else</br></br>  <br>Sure buddy, whatever makes you sleep at night.</br>  <br> remotely close to winning in the manga <br>I'd have agreed with you up until the last 2 chapters. Any doubt over how Araraku feels about Chitoge is completely gone now.</br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>What is it that makes her worst girl? I'm saying this as someone that wants to watch it but is curious why there's a lot of dislike for Chitoge.</br>  <br>Shitty tsundere.</br>  <br>Plenty of people like Chitoge. It's a harem story, so you have people in different camps that hate every other girls besides their favorite. Chitoge has been set up to win the whole thing since the oneshot, so you will see desperate Onoderafags shit post about here.</br>  <br>She is an archetypical neo-tsundere.</br>  <br>Ah, that's a shame as looking at her design that's the first blonde character I've ever seen in an anime I thought looked really cute.<br><br>From what little I know of it my guess is whomever is on the front cover, or media relating to advertising the most will win.<br><br>It's like thinking Toradora, Love Hina, or Golden Time would end any other way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Oooh, Neo-Tsundere, does that mean just the pissiness without punching the MC into the sky?</br>  <br> It's like thinking Toradora, Love Hina, or Golden Time would end any other way. <br>Toradora and Golden Time were not harem stories, though.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, sorry, I thought that straight after typing. I think Love Hina and Tenchi are the only harems I've watched.<br><br>But do you understand my sentiment of the advertising and such usually being indicative of a winner?</br></br></br>  <br> But do you understand my sentiment of the advertising and such usually being indicative of a winner? <br>While does prove to be true many times, I think that in the genre of harem that you should never doubt the writer's inability to make one girl actually win.</br></br>  <br> without punching the MC into the sky? <br>In Chitoge's case, literally no. Classical tsundere is where they stare off tsun and go dere, with no bipolar mood swings except maybe during the transition. Neo-anything just means new definition. So how we currently typically think of tsunderes would actually be neo-tsundere.</br></br>  It would appear that our MC is becoming self-aware... Real end of Nisekoi soon?  Oh Komi-sensei, you jester.  <br>He'll get amnesia and reset all his progress.</br>  <br>Remember Love Hina, but only keys?<br>Yeah.</br></br>  <br>List me a few examples, I want to read/watch a few and see if the change of winner seems like an ass pull.<br><br><br><br>Yeah, last Tsundere I seen was Ringo Oginome. I guess I try not to think of Tsunderes especially since Working.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's hilarious that ever since that thread, Nisekoi threads have been dead as fuck. People really did drop it after that.</br>  <br><br>She's gonna win, yeah.</br></br>  <br> He'll get amnesia <br>HA! That will be good for a chapter or two, but amnesia rarely lasts in manga.</br></br>  <br>I like the way you think.</br>  <br><br>He already had amnesia once.<br><br>They were Chitoge chapters.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> people actually think this <br><br>lmao, just READ the mango Kosaki is a BEST</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Spoiler: The reason the 5 of them were all childhood friends in the first place wasn't just because of all the gang stuff. It's that they were all involved in an accident that hit them with a special poison that was developed by Claude.<br><br>Marika got the worst dose, which is why she's sickly all the time. <br><br>The promise to get married was with Onodera, the normal girl who just got caught up in the over the top police/mafia war, and it was a "You'll definitely live, we'll get married when we're grown up!" way.<br><br>The reason so many details about their childhood are foggy is that Chitoge, Raku, and Onodera were then given an amnesia drug to block out their memory of the illness once it went into remission. Marika and Yui still remember everything.<br><br>Series is going to end with Marika, then Yui, then Onodera dying, leaving Chitoge and Raku. Overwhelmed by sadness, they'll avoid each other for two years, then reunite and hold hands.<br><br>The End.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If Chitoge doesn't win this will go down as one of the worst harem series to exist.  This whole season was nothing but Chitoge.<br>Chitoge, Chitoge, Chitoge.<br>When she's not being a violent gorilla, she's a bawling moeblob. Who cares?</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I wish we had 10 episodes of (worst) Onodera sweating for 20 minutes straight and playing with her disgusting rat tail</br></br>  Let us take a moment to appreciate perfection   in 3 years nisekoi writer catches a nippon cold and dies, plot still hasn't gone an inch forward   <br> Onodera sweating <br><br>It's extremely off-putting the amount of sweating she does. So gross.</br></br></br>  <br>So nobody misses it?</br>  <br> Series is going to end with Marika, then Yui, then Onodera dying <br><br>OK</br></br></br>  I just want S3 for animated fireworks. Or similar in relation to it. Finally getting Yui is fine too. S3 is overdoing it though, and don't really want to see such things stuffed into OVAs.  <br> nisekoi <br> anyone wining anytime soon </br></br>  <br> lmao, just READ the mango Kosaki is a BEST <br>But she is boring moeblob with ZERO development</br></br>  <br> lmao </br>  <br>Oh, let's do.</br>  <br>Best girl always wins.</br>    Is watching the tv version of the second season ok or do I wait for the BDs?  <br>you need an update</br>  <br>2/2</br>  <br><br>What are the chances for a Marika end?</br></br>  Chitoge was always the one<br> Sawsze in love means Forever in Love </br>  <br>Raku basically says in the last chapter he needs to stop leading her on and just reject her feelings already.</br>  <br>Marika a best</br>  <br>acording to the manga, I would say less that 10% (she's either kill or eventually leaving because of her health condition)<br>In the last chapter Raku said he needs to stop lying to her and be honest by saying he's not interested at all</br></br>  <br>She sweats more than the Colossal Titan</br>  <br>Last Chapter also confirms that the "Best friend" stuff was bullshit.</br>  <br>She never had a chance</br>  <br><br> manga panda </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>So it is true. Best girl always loses.</br></br></br></br>  <br> nothing but Chitoge. <br> Chitoge, Chitoge, Chitoge. <br>Because this manga is about False Love. The False Love turning into a true one.<br>  What if "Nisekoi" stands up for the "false love" Raku feels for Onodera? <br><br> implying that's a bad thing <br><br><br>You wrote "wins" wrong, anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Giving Raku a crush from the very beginning (Kosaki) was a stupid idea for Harem Shenanigans: The Manga.  <br>I still have to watch this last episode but no, she didn't win unless SHAFT pulled an original ending (which I doubt because there would have been some shitstorm).<br><br>She'll win in the manga regardless.</br></br></br>  <br> I have a crush <br> my crush is not my true love <br> The girl I used to hate is the girl I fell in love with <br>We all know that's the scenario.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anyone that thought otherwise was delusional. It was always just Raku trying to justify his feelings in a way that wasn't romantic. Because he's swimming in a river in Africa. Onodera at this point is a strawman.</br>  <br>The episode was just like in the manga. She decided to give herself some time to get ready to confess.</br>  <br> streaming manga <br>Kill yourself my friend :)</br></br>  <br>Raku's already being forced to realize that he cares about Chitoge more than just a "best friend". We'll probably have some open love drama between the candidates in the coming months as we go through their third year of high school.</br>  <br> he posted <br> while in a Nisekoi thread </br></br>  So, is she going to marry this guy or will she choose Raku and stop being the head of the mafia?  <br> Araraku <br> ku <br><br>Wat?</br></br></br></br>   you'll never have a fake gf that runs up in front bends over and doesn't confess   <br>Jesus Christ, learn to make webms.</br>  <br>get your eyes checked</br>  <br> gif <br> 200x120 <br> 3.28 MB <br><br>Why do you do this to me baby</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tumblr pls go</br>  <br>M-muh heart. There are no excuse for this girl no winning.</br>  <br>Doing god's work, anon.<br><br>DO YOU EVEN SHAFT?!</br></br></br>  If Onodera doesn't win, I'll fucking kill myself.  <br> Wanting the doormat to win <br><br>Funny joke</br></br></br>  <br>Everything is leading to a Chitoge ending. Komi even made Onodera that much of a nice girl so she can be happy if Raku is happy too.</br>  <br>Take pics when you do it.</br>  <br>It's really unlikely, Chitoge will win.<br><br>Which is why I dropped the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>They will barely change anything</br>  I would lick her anus all day    onodera ;_;  Chitoge Mustard Race because Onodera can't ketchup  <br>I want to commit bad things</br>  <br> tumblr <br> 3.28 MB <br>Trying too hard.</br></br></br>    <br>Fuck.</br>  It's over? I thought this shit was 22 episodes. What a shit ending.  <br> DO YOU EVEN SHAFT?! <br><br>Sure, but why would that bend a ぎ into a く?</br></br></br>  <br>HHHHHHHHHHHNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGHHH<wbr>HHHHHHHH</wbr></br>    I need to meet in-person and shake the hand of anyone who doesn't  know with certainty  that Onodera will win. I need a psychiatric analysis.<br><br>I don't know what drugs you guys are on that you think his love since elementary school is going to lose. Everybody is fine without Raku and can go on with their lives except for Onodera. <br><br> yankee gaijin going to steal honourable yakuza's heart <br> kek </br></br></br></br></br>  Chitoge a shit. A SHIT.  <br>At this point, I'm pretty sure it will be Onodera ending.<br>If you read up to the most recent chapter and think otherwise, you are stupid</br></br>  <br><br>Please stop false flagging.</br></br>  <br>Well, the concept had Chitoge winning.<br><br>So unless we see a massive swing away from the concept in the near future, I'd bank on that ending.</br></br></br>  <br> false flagging <br>is that another word for samefagging</br></br>  <br>No, it means you intentionally take the position of the side opposing you and make their point as badly as possible in order to make them look like retards.</br>  If Chitoge wins I will eat my  <br>False flag? The flag is already rock solid!<br>Yui-nee knows that and even Marika knows it. The only one who has no idea and still thinks there's a chance is Chitoge</br></br>  <br>Wow, that's such a funny joke. Not only are you shitting on Onadera betters, you're shitting on their reasons in the same go! So smart, much wow.<br> your reasoning for Onadera winning is SO shit i think you're really a chitogefag <br><br>I hate onadera too<br>but truth a truth</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your what? Your what?! This is important.</br>  <br>I'm not the guy you argued with. I only explained "false flagging".</br>  <br>But anon, everything is leading to a Chitoge ending <br>Onodera a cute but Chitoge a best</br></br>  <br>Just stop.</br>  <br>Fuck I already read Nisekoi but I gotta watch it now</br>  <br>Reminds me of Nino's hair</br>  What happened to the strike witches after they lost their shield? Are they forced to retire?<br>For example: Minna, she is already a colonel. Will she have a chance to be a general?</br>  Why would you put the destroyers at the end of the formation?<br>Isn't one of their strengths their agility and speed?</br>  <br> Are they forced to retire? <br>Worse, they are forced to wear pants.</br></br>  You know right answer, nigga   battleship Doge   <br>Let the battleships and Carriers do the long-range damage. Destroyers guards the capital ships from subs and enemy aircrafts</br>  <br>i lost it</br>  <br>This is not allowed in Liberion</br>  <br>It used to be the top job in Veniezia, probably named after that</br>  <br>Positions on the ground should still be fine for them, it's not like all the useless men are thr<br>own out of the military either.<br><br>Why are there 2 Hatsuzuki though?</br></br></br></br>  Strike Arrow Vol 3  What happened with the announcement?<br><br>Wasn't it today?</br></br>  <br><br><br> wow <br> so serene <br> much wealth <br> such Republic <br><br>It is regrettable that there are plebs here who don't know about the Doge di Venezia.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Any news about Season 3?  <br>There was no battleship with that name though.<br><br>They could've picked the Cavour or the Cesar.</br></br></br>  <br>Why would they be forced to retire? It's a military system, she can remain to be in command if she wants to and yes she does have a chance to become general especially after the war with possible promotions due her merits.<br>How do you not know 'What-if 1947' tweet series by Fumi? Go read them up on wiki, they might be non-canonical but they give an idea what they became after the war.<br>Lots of aces became test pilots after the war for researching new projects as well.<br><br>That's a good question, kind of a odd error to make a duplicate destroyer.<br><br>I'd like to know as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You won't pick the name Littorio or Impero if you didn't go fascist though.
