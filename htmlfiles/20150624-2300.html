[ Burger King have posted this on their twitter   Did Anno sell out again?     Shinji   Getting in the robot      Would the Shinji- transparency be this ugly if they'd gotten official art to work with?    I'd give it a 7/10 on the dank-o-meter.    Burger King makes an EVA reference    it's the fucking Ecuador division that does it    This is a crazy word we live in.      Not on the same powerlevel as Nature Valley.    I wonder if people in Ecuador even get that reference. I thought the Latin American countries that were into anime the most were Argentina and Mexico.    Ecuador  Literally where   Is Evangelion Day a thing?   Post the Geiger Counter one.    This is 2015 nigga. This is Evangelion Year.     Unironically or even ironically viraling.       Ecuador is actually very much into Anime.  They're about 20-30 years behind everybody else when it comes to Anime, but they REALLY love their late 80's to early 90's anime since that stuff still airs on television over there.  There's enough Weaboos in Ecuador that they even have their own anime convention. A small anime convention that they've been holding I think since 2014 in like a mall?            that stuff still airs on television over there  They're fucking lucky.     i hard they have great taste, like how danmachi is #1 anime in mexico     They're fucking lucky.  You can easily get that stuff from the internet, non-dubbed. How are they lucky?      Nothing compares to regularly scheduled anime on your local channels, anon.    HAHA HE DID IT HE MADE THE ROBOT JOKE! WHAT AN ABSOLUTE MADMAN!     mfw living 1st world country   has an anime channel that air subbed seasonal anime     We did it reddit!  When is P.A. Works going to make their next masterpiece?  In 2 years.  What is /a/'s general consensus on P.A. Works?  I think they are pretty good when it comes to slice of life genre (minus Glasslip). They tend to stumble when they try different genres (Another, Canaan).     I mostly just love their artstyle, especially those backgrounds, man.    i would prefer to learn more about directors than about studios, but alas I'm too lazy for that sort of thing. P.A. stuff is usually worth a look though.     Amazing background, comfy show. Not my favorite studio, but a good one.

I rarely see discussions about Manwha, so I decided to make a little thread it.  I'll start by posting the whore that has pissed me off more than Enju from Dice.    Want a godlike manwha? Go read Shin Angyo Onshi.  gook shit is not /a/ related   So where should we talk about it? Most manga sites have manwha anyways.    Not anime or manga  Dice is the best webtoon.   U misspelled red storm   Anon, would you a ho?  manhwa is horrible. I absolutely hate the current flood of shitty manhwa comics that are more akin to western comics than to manga. They often suffer from a ridiculous plot line, poorly drawn art and also, copy famous manga to a sickening extent. Don't even get me started on chinese ''manga'' which is so bad it makes me wonder if the chinese are invested with any modicum of creativity, if at all.  Stop appropriating Japanese art culture you sub-human gooks no one likes your shit.     It's should be /a/   Because Manhua and Manhwa is literally what Manga is pronounced in Chinese and Korean respectively. Just like how you don't differentiate between Onee-chan and Sister normally. Anyway I've never seen a janitor 404 a manhua thread yet, not that they usually last very long.       They often suffer from a ridiculous plot line, poorly drawn art and also, copy famous manga to a sickening extent  So, nothing different from manga, then?     This    Ouch, that hurts.    anywhere but here    Tower of god is great, what I don't like is the lame clothes of the character there.      GET THE FUCK OUT OF /A/ YOU GOOKS ! GO READ YOUR SUB-PAR STUPID WEBCOMICS ELSEWHERE      It's hard to take "badass" character seriously when they look like skater punks.   I like manhwa and I read them from time to time, but holy fuck why most of them run for 300 chapters? While the stories are not bad, they tend to drag it so fucking much it gets me fucking angtsy and I just read the wiki. Tower of God, dice, and Girls of the wild and 3 big examples of mad dragging.  Jack Frost is best manhwa.  Daily reminder that The Breaker's team are the biggest bitches in the manwha industry.  Post the zombie hunters.     tower of god   girl backstabbing best boy    we learn that her only motivation is just to watch stars   wtfamireading.jpg       subhuman shit   Fuck off.     Possible 1-2 year hiatus. Why do they do this to us.   Is there something wrong with  Godoka sites?  I am getting ssl_error_rx_record_too_long  Also did you guys read some Chinese Manhwa like Long Hu Men? It didn't have a nice story but still enjoyable.      Just like anything, majority of them are total shit. There's definitely great hidden gems, though most are untranslated.  Gook shit is usually abysmal with a few exceptions, but Tower of god is indeed really good.   I read Chinese Manhua to see them throw sparkly things at each other and shout their moves which can destroy planets and stuff. Most of them are more Dragon ball than Dragon ball and 10x as ridiculous.   Rak is best boy.    I rarely see discussions about Manwha  They happen occasionally. Sometimes they last long. But no one wants to put up with the "lel, gook shit doesn't belong in /a/" despite evidence to the contrary.  Anyways, that reminds me that I haven't read the last two or so chapters of ToG. Also, when was The Gamer supposed to start back up?   Slut. Almost as shit as Rachel.             but holy fuck why most of them run for 300 chapters?  Honestly, who knows? I can only assume they're trying to copy some of the larger manga.  Tower of God makes sense to be fuck long, because of the nature of its story, but Girls of the Wild should have ended ages ago. I pretty much dropped it around the time the shut-in brother was introduced, and I don't know what I even read it that far. Is it seriously still going?       Mod already said it's allowed long time ago, back when /q/ was around. Still won't change people bickering about it though.    Cat girl won. He claimed MC with a kiss and telling him, 'Remember what I said the first time we met? YOU'RE MINE'.     Cat girl won  I do not mind this, actually. Rich girl seemed kind of bland, but the story seemed to be pinning them together. Did he seriously end up with cat girl, or did she just steal a kiss?      All the 'manhwa' you listed are webcomics which run weekly, and 5 years of runtime really isn't that long.  To compensate for the increased workload, they need to fill the comic up with fillers, which is why when you marathon some parts will feel heavily dragged on.      tfw Priest will never get an ending  That movie didn't make things better either.    She stole it, Queen will win because she is the queen.   It's not anime or manga   no 10th dimensional boys anymore     bam finally catches up to rachel   they finally get to talk   she fucking pushes him down again  What the fuck man. Dude just what the fuck.        She truly deserves to rot alone just for the sake of watching stars.    While I don't really follow the newest chapter of Tog but I think that Baam is too clingy, reminds me of Mikasa relationship with Eren.    He seriously had it coming. Did he not see that see that coming? Holy fuck, but it was funny.      I hope to god that Baam finally learned his lesson but considering the retard he is, he probably didn't.  I just want him to be happy with androssi or the pink flame girl, xiaxia, whoever.  Just forget about the whore and climb the tower peacefully until FUG comes to ruin it again.        There is literally not a more attractive woman in anime.   Every girl in one piece   WHAT THE FUCK IS THE NAME OF THAT HAIRSTYLE   Every girl in every other anime    But that's not a woman. It's a woman-shaped robotic vehicle for a genetically female human brain.    elvis?   wrong   Truly the softest.    Gross. I hate her design and she's a terrible character. Oddly enough I still really enjoy GiTS      That's a girl, not a woman.    Humans are human-shaped robotic vehicles for genetically human brains.           Bob cut    She's not even the most attractive purple haired woman in anime.   Where did everything go so wrong?    You didn't learn anything.   Manga major best major.   truth tbh    Oda's change in artstyle was good in terms of designs for things like ships, architecture, etc. but it made a lot of the characters look fucking retarded. I can't handle Chopper's current appearance, its rediciulous.    I personally prefer the movie version of the Major.    She's a great character but she's a shit waifu.   Guys what if Mahou Shoujo Major?   The only true waifu in GITS is the Tachikoma.     You will never have a maid waifu tachikoma to come home to.  Why even live?        eroge aren't anime     Truely, Atsuko Tanaka's voice enslaved my dick   What makes purple hair the most patrician anime hair colour?    Misato has black hair though. The only Eva characters with unnatural hair colours are Rei and Kaworu. Akagi dyes hers blonde.        Even in a medium full of ridiculously proportioned characters Misato manages to look weird. Her waist almost doesn't exist and her arms are way too long.  And have a better purple girl        Complains about proportions   Posts Geass      you could not have picked a worse anime to make that particular point    She was too good for this world, which is why they had to ruin her    My nig.    floofy  truth      Movie version Major is the most realistic one.  SAC version Major is somewhat idealized version but with the best personality.   While this is just pure shit.         No, this is floofy.     &gt;short hair     no, it's merely fluffy. To be floofy, it also needs to be poofy.    It's not a woman though.   Is it weird that I've never seen Bleach but have a collection of pics of three different Bleach girls on my drive?    Is it weird that I've never seen Bleach  Good taste.     It's totally not my thing, but damn, the girls are hot.    Geass Anatomy is bad, but Cornelia is best girl    Jackets are cool and it's shitty that there are so few jackets in anime these days.     pretty much  only good for fap material.   I read Bleach in high school but I didn't get that far before realizing the plot got too complex and stupid. It was alright when it was just to save Rukia and had SoL elements but I read on the internet after that it was the wars and shit and ichigo turning into a hollow who the fuck cares         Do you also believe that anime needs more toast?   Motoko was created to be perfect.  SAC Motoko looks tacky as fuck   longrunning shounenshit are only good for the girls. I only read the sadpanda versions these days.    Mah nigga     americhink slut   attractive  lmao lad    Revy is fine I'm just being a shitnigger           These ladies together are my favorite anime characters, but somehow I have a hard time fapping to them.     Because you don't want to take advantage of you're waifus.    Nah, I guess I just like them as characters but anime has so much variety it's obvious I've found characters I find hotter just in terms of pure looks.     waifus   s      robots aren't women     not having a harem of waifus that you all love equally      I can't handle Chopper's current appearance, its rediciulous.   You know, I only vaguely knew what you were referring to, but now that I have it laid out before me.  Chopper used to look a lot less "kawaii" and a lot more like an actual fucking animal.       Who is best shingeki and why is it Annie?   Bert actually has standards, he would impregnate Annie not some tranny-looking thing      So does Annie. He might have a chance with Pigner.    Do you think she will just be queen of orphans or will she get to try her hand at other things too?    If Annie had standard she would love Bert, not that self hating, crybaby titan with a huge role that he can't handle that is Er- wait, fuck.   Buyfag thread, read this before asking questions http://buyfag.moe  rerelease   Cupoche look disgusting. Like nebdoroids sister with downs.   tfw want to buy kancolle figs but people keep calling me a filthy secondary    Cupoche look disgusting  Opinions     Cupoche look all right. Like Nendoroids with joints.    What the hell kind of rifle is that?     Giving a shit about what others plebs could think about the shit you buy  Step up nigga     It's better than the usual opinion. He gave a valid criticism. He doesn't like the faces.   Most retards come in here and just blurt out random franchise hate, "kek SAO autist"       Cupoche are the pochaco of nendoroids. They look disgusting and they are not ok as op.      Cupoche look disgusting  You misstyped Nanorich, anon     I don't find her that nice for some reason   how the hell do you pronounce cupoche again?   It's the best Tenshi and it was baby's first love tragedy for college aged teens who are too young to realize it's nothing special.    kyu poesh-.    Their faces are ugly. There is something very off about them. Especially the mouth. And they all have the same copypasted open mouth in every character. I like that the got joints but I wish they would learn how to make cute faces. But have to say, if they make yugioh characters I would buy them anyway.      But have to say, if they make yugioh characters I would buy them anyway.  You are in luck, there is a Dark Magician Girl in the line     Sadly the only one. I meant more like yugi or any of the other "main characters", I would also give a lot for arc v characters. Or dark magician to go with dark magician girl.   Nippon-Yasan's asking for a picture of my credit card with my name on it, but I only used a debit card that doesn't have my name on it. Payment pushed through, however. Anyone else had this problem before?   I remember someone in this thread being asked for a picture of his passport.    Other characters from YuGi-OH woould be great TBH   How do you guys feel about this?   I like it   How is Pulchra?    Mouth and chin ruin it for me. Shame too, because I really, really like it otherwise.     The ahoge is stupid.    The other version is this. I find the first more appealing. I am thinking about it but the baby face looks off. I still think it looks great.    I actually like it a bit. Just the baby chin is getting to me and I'm not sure if that's enough to stop me.   Is she cast off? If I ever see this one on sale I might get her.   It looks good but I dont see the appeal of busts or other figures where part of the body is missing, like lower legs.    The welded tits are bothersome though. I don't think so though. Semen demon isn't either.    I don't have only figures so it isn't out of place for me. Also the sculptor put a lot of detail in and if he included the rest of it then it would be either, really expensive, or not that great.    APS Underwater Rifle, it shoots big darts.  Step up your obscure gun knowledge anon.       phat will never re-release Mio or Ranko  P-Please.     Yeah the little weld and visible seams aren't great, hence why I would wait for a sale. I think the face looks pretty damn good, and the rest is okay. Not fond of the Maria fig, face is bad. And I just prefer Mio.   Can amiami banned you if you missed payment for once? I already cancel an item last month and I don't want ask them again. This figure quality looks ugly as fuck   They can and might, but I've cancelled many orders and ignored payment twice before and I'm still not banned.    I asked for cancellation 5 times didn't pay 3 times used my total cancel then I can't cancel anymore.       Next time use HLJ to save all this trouble. I usually use Amiami, but for items I'm not 100% sure of I go with HLJ.   I live in Canada and I plan on ordering something from AmiAmi.  The buyfag guide mentions something about Pornogaphy and Lolis, does this prevent me from order anything loli-like or only if that specific loli is subjected/related to 18+ stuff?      Fuck it I'll just not pay, rather spend my money on something useful. Plus I'm leaving for vacation this late month. I'll keep that in mind, mainly use amiami as well.      I like loli, but I wouldn't recommend it because it pays with consequences if customs happen to open your parcel. Just get stuff with adult looking woman and you'll be fine.    I've missed payment for 2 months in a row, and I'm not banned.    Why did you even preorder her? Only po where you know it will be good     something useful  Like what? Another prostitute?     but what is classified as loli? I want to pick up a PriPara nendoroid, is that not even safe?    Wow, aside from the giant eyes, she actually looks Japanese.    You're retarded.    Of course that's safe. Just don't purchase any lewd loli products. Actual pornogarphy or statues with nudity etc    Nigger use your brain. How is a nendoroid even sexual? Don't get lewds and you'll be fine.    I almost got her too but &gt;welded tits    What are you planning to do with that nendo that you even think its lewd?    Not sure I just thought it was gonna be decent, but I also browse other daiki kogyo figures and they look like shit too   Food, clothing      Looking worse and worse and getting more expensive.  This is outrageous.     If these were priced like figmas they might actually be okay, but fuck the prices are outrageous for the quality and just in general.   I'm almost tempted just because it's Haruna though.        but I've cancelled many orders and ignored payment twice before and I'm still not banned.  Man, fuck you. I've asked to cancel something once in 4 years of buyfagging (a tentative pre-order with an unknown release date, at that) and they politely told me to fuck off.    So, Yotsuba got licensed in my place. Should I?   Is that Kaiba?    Probably because it was a tentative one, procuring stock for those is more complicated for them after all. So cancelling one of those is probably the biggest fuck you that you can give them.     procuring stock for those is more complicated for them after all  Yeah sure except they hadn't secured stock for the order. To this day they still haven't, even though I ordered it last year. They could email me tomorrow and say "lol whoops sorry couldn't get it" and I'd be shit out of luck because it's getting harder and harder to find elsewhere. I've been stuck with this fucking order in limbo for 8 god damn months. That's why I wanted to cancel. They're the ones screwing me over, not the other way around.     every order this month delayed   second month in a row   I'm getting the shakes.      That's completely ridiculous. There's no tentative order that should last more than a month.   Boku girl figure with interchangeable parts when?  Also was really looking forward to new prison school figures, but the more and more I see of the new anime the less and less I think it's going to happen. It looks so shitty.     I know. That's why I'm so mad. I've asked them to confirm whether they can get it and they just sent me a passive-aggressive message explaining what a tentative pre-order is and directing me to their FAQ.     it looks so shitty.  No.     It's the perfect time to hunt for some bargains on released figures!    Did you see the OP and ED song choices? That animation quality is nowhere near Danmachi or Railgun either.  I'd rather be realistic now, than delusional and hopeful based on no evidence.     If I didn't despise Infinite Shitos I'd get bunny french slut, it's a nice figure, especially for that price   Well, that's just retarded. I would have guessed that they would gladly cancel it if they have so much problems with it themselves, but they seem insanely stubborn about this for no apparent reason. What is it even?      harder and harder to find elsewhere  It's an item that was indeed released elsewhere after you preordered? That's strange. I'd expect that behavior from them if it was something that kept being delayed by the maker, as I've seen items get delayed month after month until it just says "available late 201x."   I wouldn't be bothered myself unless it was a real expensive item, and I wish you'd post what it is, but I'd understand not wanting to.      Is Yuki Mori Megahouse's Saber?  What's a good proxy service for yahoo auctions? I have a few that are probably gonna need some last minute sniping.  If she's not at next wonfes I'll give up on her. Shame she looks great.

Seriously.    No eps better this way in my opinion. I'd rather hear 1 actual song than 2 half songs   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rQJ<wbr>pfqinfXQ</wbr>  [ ]  That's the only good OP, but I wish the show was just as cool.     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=w18<wbr>dv0QEJAM</wbr>  [ ] https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XXv<wbr>wVFS_X5Q</wbr>  [ ] https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6rO<wbr>BGpfRpRo</wbr>  [ ] https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=JRj<wbr>_5a7jJ_A</wbr>  [ ] https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Fo_<wbr>t4143wEc</wbr>  [ ] https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zl9<wbr>KCz3J0g0</wbr>  [ ] https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=SHy<wbr>Wdf0-Muw</wbr>  [ ] https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7yM<wbr>a48EKSTo</wbr>  [ ] https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=W07<wbr>UEQopVqw</wbr>  [ ] https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=O54<wbr>MlRyHcbI</wbr>  [ ]                Not liking the overly artsy second op   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=I_m<wbr>5ab6cahM</wbr>  [ ]  I don't know why but it's grown on me so that I like it more than the third.        https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=AdG<wbr>kwwMAbM0</wbr>  [ ] best one  dat lonely kisame and tobi       because I always feel you in me  OP2 is fine too but I think I like the 3rd one a little more. Both OPs are wasted on that show.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=k_R<wbr>6pqlNG4M</wbr>  [ ]   It always felt like they jumped the gun on the beginning of op 16, the whole recap would have been a better touch on the final opening,   Why won't anyone rip the Crunchyroll manga, which is already at ch.55? Also, Donyatsu thread.     is already at ch.55?   It's actually at chapter 63. I guess i'll dump it just for you anon.         Thanks for spoilers, but is it anywhere to be downloaded?                         Oh, I liked this one. Didn't quite enjoyed the CG shorts they made, though.            Character's power is invulnerability     Explication dialogue that should be common knowledge in the shows universe    Gurren lagann, not so good Mushishi? More like MushiSHIT Aria, a show about nothing. Hellsing, Twilight except shit. Darker than Black? More like Browner than SHIT Akagi. If I wanted to see old people sitting around a table I'd visit my grandma more often. Neon Genesis Evangelion, makes about as much sense as a pedophile in a retirement home. Serial Experiments Lain? more like Serial Experiments LAME shitsux Dennou Coil? More like shitty Fractale ripoff without Yamakan. Samurai Shitpoo. Shitty plot and writing, shitty characters, and even shittier music. Beck, if I wanted to watch shitty bands, I would go see Tool live. Kaiba. Pretentious Powerpuff girls shit with LOLDEEP. Tatami Gaylaxy. Groundhogs day for hipsters. Paprika. Pretentious Inception ripoff now with moeshit. One Piece, if I wanted to watch a good shounen I would watch Naruto. Kino no Tabi? If I wanted to watch a dyke on a motorcycle, I'd go visit San Francisco instead. Eureka 7, more like Gurren Lagann 2. Vinland Saga, shitty manga and even worse anime. 2 episodes in and I fell asleep. Hidamari Sketch, confirms my belief that art school students are idiots. Kurenai, shitty anime about an ugly loli. Koi Kaze, if I thought incest was wrong I would stop having sex with my little sister. Usagi Drop? More like Usagi DROPPED Grave of the Fireflies? If I wanted to watch a whiny cunt and his little sister fuck around I'd go to Chuck E. Cheese. Golden Boy? If I wanted to see a genius get horny, I'd videotape myself masturbating. Mononoke, if I wanted to see a crossdressing, homosexual pothead wearing make-up, I'd move to Brazil. Toradora, if I wanted to watch a menstrual bitch raging I'd hide my mom's midol. Claymore, looks like a dick, strong beginning and middle but a cheesy ending.                             OP makes /v/ tier greentext thread    uses reddit reaction image    it's also a .jpg using the wrong blue     lol.. just got done reading that superhero book by Sanderson  Aren't any actual heroes but one persons power is immortality  Kill her and she reincarnates one to two weeks later at a random spot within several kilometers  Kinda OP        Serial Experiments Lain? More like Serial Experiments LAME shitsux  Barakamon? More like Bakamon since you'd have to be fucking dumb to like it  Mushishi? More like MushiSHIT       Are you a professional anime reviewer?     This isn't an "overrated shit" thread faggots.     Wrong thread, nigga.    Character is forced to fight a stronger opponent and instead of dying plot armor saves you   Character is weaker than a bad guy but gains some new power that allows him to beat the bad guy     Nice pasta.    people train their entire lives to reach x level   character trains for 3 months   surpasses all of them      you'renew is showing    newfag spotted    you're fast, guess I'd better quit holding back     being unironically autistic     character does thing    character can beat angels and gods   can withstand attacks that would kill almost anyone else   can't beat a regular human trained in self defense  touma pls      New main enemy   New main character bullshit power-power up      Paprika being inception ripoff   Please... I can't take this stupidity for far too long      everyone including the MC and poster girl die at some point and there is no plot armor whatsoever   I'm so fucking tired of this trope, how am I supposed to get invested in the story if any story there is gets essentially wiped out in a few episodes?    dang... missed it   Hachiman is a piss poor character   yes it is    Fuck off Bear, you proved your autistic ass wrong ages ago when you finally bothered to watch Lain properly    I know, it's a joke. I like all 3 of those quite a bit.   Misunderstandings are the lowest form of writing.   Since when you've been shitposting about how bad Lain supposedly is up until 2 months ago at least.    It's been over half a year since I rewatched Lain and I realized the errors of my ways and that it's actually a really good show.   Time travel. You can excuse every kind of plot twist with this   boy being scared of female nudity.   Only if you're a secondary. FEEL butchered the fuck out of his character and to some extent all of the novels.     if I wanted to see a genius hey horny, I'd take myself masturbating       MISUNDERSTANDINGS    Fireflight is never going to be as bad plotwise as someone like Accelerator or Touma, though. I'm certain that she can be killed and am pretty sure she's going to kick the bucket in Calamity.   However, I did give the Lord Ruler a side-eye because Gold Compounding is completely OP.      That would imply that all comic book writers are awful writers.    I see no issue with this.     character is time freeze vampire who can summon a punch ghost  Every time.      And?     Stop.    Those abilities are wrong, Hachiman is an idiot. You think he is good at something because he is telling the story from his own perspective.    As if there is something else.     Character is so powerful that can fucking bend reality, the universe and manipulate dimensions, change the story and shit like that   The writer probably doesn't even know what he is doing and what half of the words really mean, but he threws whatever sounds big and powerful to make the character look broken as hell  Bonus point if:  Said character then is used in every powerlevel thread ever with an smug reaction like "Are U Guyz even trying"   +20 if is a loli or some faggot guy  I fucking hate that shit but japs and capeshit writers love to do it.         Girl looks like a 6 year old   Is actually a super special 4000 year old demon dragon saint god judai chosen one     They are indeed.    he is fast!   I can tell he has no opening   Heh, you are strong. Seems like I will have to use 'that'       Can still be good.  Like that one yuri anime i watched a bit, where the MC was immortal, but that was also her weakness, as she got tortured, and at one point even turned into an aerosol by a plane.        I liked how hxh threw a curveball at the ant arc. Where gon and killua were training to reach that certain level, and then just fail.      Vinland Saga, shitty manga and even worse anime. 2 episodes in and I fell asleep.  I know this is pasta, but does Vinland Saga actually have an anime?    Character telling another character something they already know     friendship makes me stronger than you!      character's power is doing whatever the fuck it wants   And there are people who will defend this.     Sadly, there is no Vinland Saga anime.    MC getting his ass beat   he uses a new OP attack to defeat the baddie   WHY mode: his new attack is just a variation of his signature move      character summons swords out of thin air   main character is a sword specialist  And worst of all:  hayai!       "if you kill me you'll be just as bad as me!"    character can stop time    HxH was pretty good with the curveballs. Refreshing.  Was it ever explained why they still wound up neck deep in that whole affair after failing Netero's test?     show me what you got!        i miss her ;_;      obligatory            Speaking of gintama, why is todays episode airing early?       Wait, what? Is airing early? Now tell me that the manga chapter is tomorrow and you'll make my day    I'll know in about an hour if this is correct or not, hope the thread lasts    Thank you anon    Don't worry, i won't let this thread die        muh waifu    Tsukki a cute, a best girl   Good taste anon        rare never seen before               I feel like a dumbass because I always forget what episode that is from      The episode where Hijikata gets ocd from Buddha and Kondo gets his dick stuck in a urinal hole     The one where he gets his dick stuck while peeing      Joseph scarf and Caesar pose   Has a stand without a stand arrow.   Gin is way too op       Yeah I can just never remember the episode number     under rated episode    113      That shit killed me   Come on new ep   H-hes going to be alright, r-right? Everything is going to be daijoubu, right? Right?    Shh... It's just red mayonnaise    Thank you anon, now the thread will die    Katsura ja nai, ill Smith da    just as daijoubu as  the shogun     Shouldn't katsura become ill Smith in the second movie?    He's going to wake up and beat the shit out of the Tendou with a bad-ass new scar in his face   Right? ;_;        We can't let this Thread die    C-Course he will anon... of course he will, the he'll marry Otae and raise a family, just like he wanted... He just needs to sleep for a bit so let's let him be for a while.     <br/>   I swear to God if he doesn't stand up...       my body is ready  When is new chapter coming out?   At the usual time.   Oh fuck you animegg for getting my hopes up   What happened?   It didn't drop but it was a nice dream   R-right, Hijikata shouldn't push his mayo-addict to his fellow comrade. Pict unrelated.    Please don't die    It airs at the usual time today     What happen to the shogun?                        I love this arc    Oh god my fucking heart    When the night has come and the land is dark and the moon is the only light we'll see.          DONDAKE     Probably going to get shit on for asking this but I'm sure there are some tumblr using anons. Does anybody know if those cows are butthurt about Hijikata being a fat pig of a creature?       tbh im really unhappy that the anime thought it was OK to air something like that in 2015, but this is the same series that makes light of transgenders and genderfluid people so i dunno what i was even expecting tbh.   hopefully the series/ Hideachi will grow up out of these dated, backwards as hell views on queer folk        Please tell me you grabbed this from tumblr and didn't write it yourself. Please.           Being butthurt about comedy    Hot off the .webm presses.    The arc will end today  Fun times, the only time Gintama got numerous threads that hit bump limit continuously       Reaction image thread <br/>   no   7 minutes   meizhi      I still dont get this joke   it's time  yamazaki's voice makes me feel things    DAT GORILLA  next week is the bento chapter. I don't know how they're going to fill up an episode with only one chapter   Tsukky dissapointed by size of your dick   Where can I find the OST of the new season ? I really like the track played when Dekkobokofags appear       responding to obvious bait       I can hear the trumpets.    Only one chapter? They didn't learn their lesson did they  Also no one screenshot the stream?      [HorribleSubs] Gintama - 277 [720p].mkv   It's out!                 he should just go to shugo for that.          He's Ginsexual            would let her abuse me all day.    [HorribleSubs] Kyoukai no Rinne - 12 [720p].mkv   All 20-25 followers, ARISE!     I think Souma's still my AOTS, but Rinne's my super comfy anime.    She's the Shampoo, isn't she?     even has his pinkie finger raised   Genma Saotome could take asshole lessons from this guy.      BEST GIRL INCOMING   I remember someone saying they didn't see these hands often anymore.  https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-11/chapter-1/</wbr>   Wait, would that mean he's actually a senseifag, or that he intended for his post to be called out as a false flag?   Little sister won right?   She already won before Hachiman got turned down by Orimoto    too lewd    I think this comic will answer your question  (1/3)     I finished Rebellion. ...So Madoka Thread. Reaction Images or general disscusion.   Ok. Oh,  and ttyumbjb or whatever it's called was me. It's a fake account      Using fake accounts.     Morning Apple~chi.    I'll add you on my real later on.  I chose Destiny for now.    Good morning. Guess my name will be chi again.          http://kotaku.com/why-destiny-playe<wbr>rs-feel-screwed-over-1713417685</wbr>    This little fucking shit stain faggot holy shit.  I'm just a quarter of the show in and everything this goddamn prick does is to fuck everything up and either act smug or pretend like its not a big deal by doing jack shit about it.  I watch Chinese Cartoons to ease up and relax after a stressful week of dealing with irrevocable shitheads like him only to find out that the show stars the same kind of irrevocable shitheads.  Please tell me he gets fired or at least becomes less of a piece of shit   Ema is best girl.            Right.  I don't even remember her name.     Left is Andou, right is Satou.    Right.   Haters be hatin' cause Tarou x Miyamori is canon.   24 replies   No true best girl    Anyone else hoping Jugo finishes Fagg B this week?   Why would they? It's a pretty logical conclusion when you think about it. I wasnt in that thread btw    Yhwach pls. You're not decieving anyone   To those of you who missed it.  Hope is not yet lost. Last week I contacted a TV Tokyo producer and asked him about a Bleach sequel. He says he hasn't heard any news, but the chances are pretty good since Bleach is their highest rated TV show.     Show us the conversation. I dont believe you....dont lift my hopes man ;_;    Well it's a twitter conversation and it's nothing special, really. It only tells us that the TV station that aired it is eager to air it again and that you shouldn't believe faggots who say it was cancelled due to bad ratings. </blockquote>]
