[ hello darkness my old friend  Oh shit. I forgot these were a thing. Guess its time to go rewatch theresheis. Not /a/ though.  <br>This.<br><br> that catchy theme tune <br>I going to go on the flash page for the first time in years and years</br></br></br></br>  <br>If I remember correctly, it was made by a Korean. So yeah, definitely not /a/. Maybe if it was a Japanese production.</br>  <br>It's relevant to nothing but nostalgia.</br>  <br>/a/ is eastern media /co/ is western. No need to be anal just because it isn't strictly nip work. <br><br>Or are you the kinda person that thinks Japan is the only country in the world that has "anime"?</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit.</br>  <br>No need to get upset Kim.</br>  <br>Holy shit.</br>  I remember this.  <br>かみのかごをいのちび</br>  How can a show targeted toward kids be so lewd?<br><br>Also, anyone else excited for the new movie?</br></br>  <br><br>dam son good capture</br></br>  <br>Clemont's Luxray is anon.<br><br> always angry <br> always grumpy <br> bites people <br><br>it took Rambgoo to beat the edge out of him</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How do you feel about Pokemon having more budget than your average seasonal anime?  <br>Please don't bait /vp/'s worst shitposter.</br>  <br>Oh, fair enough. My apologies.<br><br>A shame thats how its presented in the anime. Its my favourite pokemon.</br></br></br>  So this is pretty much "JUST FUCK HER ALREADY" the anime x1000?  <br>Papi has a butt. Polt has an ass.</br>  <br>A hairy ass.</br>  <br>Furry plz go.</br>  <br>She can shave it if nessesary<br><br><br>No</br></br></br></br>  <br>No she can't.</br>  It's almost time for this season's battle harem that's a loose mix of Chrome Shell Regios meets Ar tonelico.<br><br>Let's take it easy and have a comfy thread.</br></br>  <br>How can someone even be this angry</br>  <br>Anon. Everything is okay anon. Breath in and out. Let it all out.</br>  <br>I can't imagine how angry a person needs to be to type this.</br>  <br>And you watched raw without understanding it?</br>  <br>This anime uses a lot of cg so it's resemble a game espescially environment.</br>  Another week for the next episode.  <br><br>Seems like a worthy legend for Nazarick.</br></br>    Does heinz-sama actually have any plans for nazarick outside of "Gotta keep my friend's NPCs alive."?<br><br>Like, is he thinking about making it into a city or a fortress or conquering the world or just chilling in his tomb?</br></br>  <br>are you underestimating jews? that's how they get you</br>  <br> heinz <br><br>What is this heresy?</br></br></br>  The anime made Centorea so much cuter than I thought she was in the manga. Mero is looking like a real cutie pie in anime form too.  <br> You'd cuddle Cerea the same way as Rachnee, face to face with her legs splayed downwards. <br>How do centaur spines work?</br></br>  <br><br>Would a Hippocampus be a subspecies of Centaur, or subspecies of Mermaid?</br></br>  <br>Can't remember if I ever saw a cleanly done Lamia card.</br>  <br>They have a fulcrum at the human waist, same as Lamia.</br>  <br>Thats old harpy culture nobody really follows anymore. Currect harpies typically settle down with one guy according to Papi's mom.</br>  reminder  <br> Go-qualia <br>Nice taste</br></br>  <br><br>Sounds more like 'go/ko (cen)itai'. There doesn't seem to be enough time for saying the whole thing.</br></br>    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=A0_<wbr>vm3YFkG8</wbr>  [ ]    Are you telling me with all that fancy computerized animation techniques out now, animation studios can't use some program to automatically stop QUALITY from happening?  <br>It'd actually look like puppets if done right</br>  So what is this thread about anyway?  Cross Ange QUALITY thread?  <br>The footgame in this show was god awful.</br>    I maintain that if Asuka had been the protagonist of 3.33 and it didn't have such a meaninglessly long timeskip, it wouldn't have been that bad of a movie. I felt like a lot of characters were bogged down by 3.33 and while Shinji wasn't necessarily portrayed badly, I feel like all the extra bullshit in 3.33 probably ruined his psyche. It was too much.<br><br>Also my waifu's reputation was ruined, so there's that too.<br><br>Whatever. Let's have an Eva thread.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope, that's either Asuka, Ritsuko or Misato.<br><br>Everyone wants a piece of Rei though, she's that good.</br></br></br>  <br>I wish Toji got to become a real pilot for at least one episode</br>  <br>No, it's Gendo<br> Sleeps with Yui <br> Sleeps with Naoko <br> Sleeps with Ritsuko <br> Probably goes into Unit 01's cage and jacks off on the walkway </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He should have been a pilot in 3.0<br><br> mfw imagining the banter between him, Asuka and Mari. <br> mfw 3 vs. 3 Eva battle </br></br></br></br>  <br>I skipped along that scene because of how slow it was and the shitty music</br>  What's the difference between kimono and yukata?  http://marumaru.in/b/origin/94141<br><br>First part of 219 spoilers.<br><br>Full chapter is 65 pages.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We're all confused anon. Just do some re-reading and it'll (probably) make sense.</br>  <br><br>Anon i advice you to take things less seriously in here.<br>we probably agreed on many subjects in other threads or maybe even here, since i samefagged.</br></br></br>  <br>just remove yourself from here</br>  To the guy who read all the chapter already: does Lavi appears? Pls respond this is important to me.  <br>Not the one you're requesting, but I saw Lavi in the WIP images on the author's twitter, so he most liekly appears in this or the next few chapters. Th eodd thing is that  he was with the MC. </br>  Zetsubou mo kibou mo  <br>TL pls.</br>  <br>Looking at it, only Hibiki and Maria would get their birthdays as the season is on. The 6 have pretty spread out birthdays.</br>  <br>Iguchi's was the 11th I think. I'm pretty sure she said her and Nanjo were only one day appart.</br>  <br>Like this?<br>She only has to wear glasses and no one would be able to recognize her.</br></br>  <br>Would she try to be hip and down with the kids like a cool mom?</br>   have masochistic curiosity to watch a dub <br> all the dub voice actors sound like they're reading off the script <br><br>how do dubfags deal with this?</br></br></br>  <br>Actually a lot of people who like dubs are mad that he keeps getting casted at the main character. Just look at the comment section for the Fate dub.<br><br>Basically what  said.</br></br></br>  <br> or more Japanese <br>As usual it's the dubfag obsessing over Japan. Good luck finding a subfag that watches Japanese shows in Japanese and French shows in English.</br></br>  <br><br>I completely agree. There is nothing wrong with watching both.<br><br>People get asshurt over everything, even people's preferences. And then they wonder why people call them out on their shit. Everyone in this thread is a fucking 10 year old cry baby.<br><br>"WAHH WATCH A SHOW THEY WAY I LIKE IT!!!"<br>"WAHH YOU'RE NOT A TRUE FAN!!!111"<br><br>Seriously shut the fuck up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm not the one learning Japanese just to watch an anime.</br></br>  <br>If you actually knew japanese you'd know how terrible and unsubtle japanese VAs sound most of the times. At least english ones don't sound like they're doing a school play.</br>  It's out.  <br>Tsuredure Children has always been the name of the series. For some reason gaijin just never used it, even if they were using the site the series was on now and pre-vol, which literally says it in the URL. The Tsuredure Children vols include fixes, proper order of chapters, along with additional ".5" sections placed in between chapters that aren't available elsewhere AFAIK. Various pre-vol sources the author setup likely had a chance to have their own weird upload order, including the main site. The listings differ from the vols, and there are also printed release only chapters. The webcomic didn't get fix updates, so you can check the silly changes if you want. To add to this tl;dr, might as well address the romanization of the series. The "zu" portion is like は, the most simplified proper form is "du", but people will be using "wa" instead of "ha". In the same sense, "wa" will let gaijin pronounce things better, but it isn't right. The pages, site name etc are using du though.</br>  When I grow up I want to be as based as OP.  <br>Forgot pic</br>  <br><br>Fucking Spaghettiman</br></br>  <br>I wonder if stuff in this video actually happens in Japan.<br><br>Just can't imagine it when I look at the western world.</br></br></br>  Any news? The DVD is finally out.  <br>Is Gino strangling that woman or is he trying to show some affection in weird Gino way?</br>  <br> Kinect is mandatory <br>Into the trash it goes</br></br>  <br>N I P P L E S<br>I<br>P<br>P<br>L<br>E<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You may have missed the whole point of the eliminator mode anon it's the psycho-pass version of death penalty it's not there to protect the enforcers or inspectors. <br><br>But they also execute people after capture and as we saw in one of the first episodes people's Psycho-Pass do not necessarily stay at death sentence levels. The paralyzer is capable of handling the situation and then there is the chance for rehabilitation or they can simply be executed afterwards. Having on the spot executions is simply a way avoid showing Sibyl's faults.</br></br></br>  <br> showering with Kougami <br>GOTY</br></br></blockquote>]
