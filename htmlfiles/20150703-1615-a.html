Obviously the Miia will be another bellydance but the idea I had for Cerea is as good, at least for me.  Shy Cerea lifting her skirt to show her pelvis/hips, like she doesnt have a vagoo I can do that, but still it somehow feels lewd. </br>  <br>Cute lewd is ok. Plus Cerea is great.</br>  <br>Seconded for cute lewd Cerea that won't even require spoilering but will because  some mods are easy to trigger .</br>  <br><br><br>Casting my vote for cute lewd Cerea as well.</br></br></br>  <br>You do you loen, but belly dance Miia  or really any Miia   is always welcome</br>  <br><br> Obviously the Miia will be another bellydance <br><br>Stop it, Loen. Stop trying to kill me by having my penis rupture.<br>Why must you do this?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Plus there is so much Miaa and Rach-nee art, give a good girl like Cerea some love. She deserves it.</br>  <br> mangafox </br>  Fuck these ridiculous Adobe Illustrator prices.

I think it gets some hate in /ic/, at least the few times I have been there its been like that, but Im not sure why, since it works wonders for me.

You will have better luck in /ic/ with that question.</br>  <br>They'd be suggesting high priced/overly complicated ones and hating each other's tastes.</br>    <br>Thanks Loen. I'm the anon who drew the big nippled Rach and I was considering buying a tablet to further my drawing. Any tips to get clean lines like yours when I draw in Sai/PS?</br>  <br> Okay, Cerea then. <br>God's be praised!</br></br>    NTR doujins practically here  <br>Literally can't wait.</br>  <br>There's already a preview for a Papi one<br><br>Glad I couldn't care less what happens to Papi</br></br></br>  <br>You monster.</br>  <br>Fuck you!</br>  <br>You have a point there anon, but I really dont know.<br><br>In SAI, change your Ctrl+Z to a shortcut, a single key, because you gonna need it a lot (I have mine on backspace, Im left handed so its a well placed key for my free hand). Then do clean smooth lines in one swing, thats what makes it look clean. You will be re-doing the very same line 5+ times til it makes you happy, and same proccess with every single line.</br></br></br>    <br> Papi <br>Such a waste when we have Miia and Mero begging for a NTR doujin.</br></br>  <br>Mero yes<br><br>Miia no<br><br>I will genocide crusade anyone that makes anything with Miia that's not vanilla and love filled</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When was this done?!

I think she should be an idol.</br>  <br> Miia no <br>Sorry but your waifu was probably created with NTR in mind. It's no wonder Okayado filled the house with other girls, including one with this particular fetish.</br></br>  <br>Damn straight.</br>  <br>So all of them<br>Because let's face it, the artists will be able to pull the most contrived plots out their asses for each girl to be NTR'd. Every single one of them.</br></br>  <br> implying Suu can possibly be NTR'd </br>  <br>This yours?</br>  <br>Is this really a life worth living?</br>    <br>She can be NTR'd away from Papi</br>    <br>That dragon girl looks alarmingly like she's &gt;shiggy diggy doo-ing</br>  <br>But if we're following the logic of her being main girl, wouldn't she be a bad singer on top of being a bad cook?</br>  <br>Somehow I think Papi would be the one being NTR'd in that situation.</br>  <br>Suu inflatable-seats for sale when?</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wub<wbr>VtyKQ1is</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>THANK YOU BASED SHAFT</br></br>  <br>Looks like garbage.<br><br>Bones is truly dead.</br></br></br>  <br>Too visually stylish for you?<br>Go back to your generic moecrap.</br></br>  <br> SHAFT <br>That's Bones show</br></br>  <br> SHAFT <br>It's BONES</br></br>  shaft style has infected other studio  It's no so much Shinbo's style.

All the outfits are equally slutty.</br>  <br>I have always wondered, but I don't remember Sento being in a bunny suit before.</br>  <br>She's probably just mad that she doesn't have the chest to make use of it properly.</br>   Sento reignited my love for healthy bodies.   <br>Meanwhile Salama is excited at the prospect of being in her waifu's clothes and mixing their bodily fluids together</br>  <br>Am I the only one disappointed that they all just tried on Muse's outfit instead of swapping them all around?</br>  <br>I know google searches differ by region. But come on.</br>  <br>wew lad</br>  If they do a s2, they gotta do more of flustered blonde sento loli, that was moe as fuck.  Which one is the best?  <br>Hopefully never, this was the worst garbage KyoAni put out since Munto.</br>  <br>They're all disgusting.</br>  <br>Only Sylphie's outfit.

I thought it is like calling a female a virgin; it is unfair, but it seems the insult doesn't work unless it is a guy.</br></br>  <br>They're both terrible with expressing their true feelings</br>  <br>Are you autist or just catholic?</br>  <br>Just fuck already</br>  <br>But sento was clearly embarrassed and jealous over not having as much sexual experience as AV girl.</br>  <br> Are you autist or just catholic? <br>Calling a female submissive and timid just doesn't work as an insult. I am not saying this is right, but I don't make the cultural rules. Insults only work if it implied social expectations.

But it is done via subtext because both are not ready to go any further for now.<br>Sento called him Seiya instead of Kanie-kun, and "fixed his tie" when there was nothing wrong with it.

I'm no big Kyoani fan but even I can that Ishihara is pretty much their only good director and pretty much the only reason they get the level of acclaim they do for visual styles. He's seriously better off leaving the company and going freelance, he could probably accomplish a lot more without having to be tied down doing only shows about moe girls.  <br>/r9k/?</br>  <br>Earth and Air.</br>  <br>Does /r9k/ hate moeblobs?

Don't quote me on this, but if there are questions left in you they're probably going to be answered in the later volumes.</br>  <br>Is that Tomo and when did Mary dye her hair?</br>  <br>No they aren't.</br>  <br> he hasn't heard about the SPEERS yet <br>They're the "evil" Player 2 variations of the Musashi cast.</br></br>  <br>Is the one of the right supposed to be Gin?<br><br>because her hands are HUGE.</br></br></br>  <br>No she is not.</br>  <br>SPEER 08 Takenori Kasuya and Shima Sakon.<br><br><br>Perspective does funny things.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They are Kazuya Takenori and Shima Sakon.<br><br>Sakon is really tall.</br></br></br></br>   Best girl of horizon   <br>She does have pretty big hands regardless though.

Though I guess it makes sense knowing that Christianity/Judaism is the one true religion of Low-Gear in the Kawakamiverse.</br></br>  How would you guys feel if Yen Press somehow licenses Horizon when they make their new license announcements in a few days?  <br>That's never going to happen, so there is no point to talk about it.</br>  This franchise seems to have maintained quite a cult following despite not having a season in something like 3 years now.  <br>Dedicated fans always remain, and having a new translated chapter almost daily helps a lot.</br>  <br>Mad because it'd be a stick in the wheel for fan translations but happy because it'd bring more attention to Kawakami works. But mostly mad.</br>  <br>Having translations almost daily helps.</br>  <br> there is a lot of questions and things left from that volume <br>Like what exactly? <br>The story was intentionally fast paced, it was like a competitive race.</br></br></br>  <br>Kawakami works seem to have some kind of quality to do that to people, considering the Japanese following is also small but very dedicated.</br>  <br>Upset unless they hired Js06</br>  Me slow.  <br> the resource planet was armed as a defense base and the residential planet was modified into a production base. <br>Why isn't it the other way around? Wouldn't you want to have the production as close to the resources as possible so you don't have to transport them back and forth, and to build defenses to protect the cities already there on the residential planet?</br></br>   #<br>Its reliance on mechanical dragons as means of warfare might have made resources more valuable than the population (which was dying anyway) since it only takes one or two men but a fuckload of metal to send one out to battle. Just my speculation, I don't remember if an official reason was given in the volume.</br>  <br>You go Ivan, show those halftones what you're made of.</br>  <br>What are they reading, /a/?<br>FuturePast IRC?</br></br>  <br>Mai brother.<br><br>I want a Neito.</br></br></br>  <br>What's with the witch hats anyway?<br>And why do they turn me on so?</br></br>  <br>According to js06 they were advertising one of Naruze doujins in the futurepast summer comiket.</br>    <br>Not really, I mean  Judaism developed because Babel was sent back in time, so it's all just a big loop  and in the EDGE era they discover there are no gods.</br>  <br> And why do they turn me on so <br>Witch hats are cute</br></br>  <br>Actually, they discover there are gods but they were different as religions portrayed them, so faiths changed in accord to it.</br>  Is there a different MC in each novel ? In the first novel was Tooru , Tenzo in the second and the Naito third . ( I just read to the third ) How is the next novels?  <br>It kind of follows that pattern for the first three volumes but the later ones I don't believe have a lead character like that.</br>  <br>Urquiaga is kind of the lead character of Vol. 4.</br>  <br>Even if they did his localization choices would be overruled by the localization team.</br>  <br>Not really, he is important but not enough to be called a lead.</br>  <br>Is that the game with 2hus?</br>  <br>Nope, this girl is the lead character, also the best horizon (talking about Narumi).</br>  <br>Tadaoki comes close for the Nordlingen side of Vol. 7's story.</br>  <br>Mang, just a question.

I would have liked about a week more of Iida suffering before his confrontation, but it's fine like this.</br></br>  <br>Ok so here is my google translate interpretation :<br> Gran Torino attacks Izuku, who avoids him and even manages to grab him. <br> However, Gran Torino doesn't seem particularly hurt by Izuku's grab. Izuku is extremely tired. <br> Gran Torino takes the training in an apparently well renowned swimming pool. <br> He tells Izuku to swim while using his full-body OFA. <br> Crowbro and Jesus-Girl both ended with some kind of Pastor-Hero.  <br> The hero seems to give some speech on their personality, bringing Jesus Girl to tears and confusing Crowbro. <br> Something about Ashito's streets at night <br>It seems the end is missing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like Lady Justice and Kagamigami are next axe targets</br>  <br> &gt;He tells Izuku to swim while using his full-body OFA. <br><br><br>Here we go, Deku will get buff like a bull.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I thought they ran over to Black Clover?<br><br><br>We still get genderbent Deku from time to time it's just not at the level it was before.

Even if they go with 2 chapters per episode it will reach chapter 50 at episode 25.

I personally just kind of love it.<br><br>Also since Deku has a distinctly different frame/body type than young all might will it even be possible for him to -ever- 100% without hurting himself do you think?

Like thinking heroes need to be feared instead of glorified policemen? I don't know. But hey it's better than him going villain.</br>  <br>Ok then.

Lets guess which two will be his next targets alongside Iida.</br>  <br>He is now quite evil.</br>  <br>4 in japenese can mean death</br>  <br>His co-worker and some random hero</br>  So Stain does 4 murders for the same reason Mista hates the number?  <br>Tetsutetsutetsutetsu and kirishima</br>  Nnooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo<wbr>ooo<br><br>Iida better not turn to a fucking edge lord over his brother like sasuke did!</br></br></wbr>  <br>Oh please god no.</br>  <br>Precisely, yes.<br> Check my 4 </br></br>  <br>Who's mista? i only know yumishika that hates the number</br>  <br>Foreshadowing</br>  <br> Who's mista </br>  <br>That's quite evil.</br>  <br>Being an edge lord isn't so bad the horrible thing is being a RETARDED edge lord like sasuke who tried to destroy everything his brother tried to protect AND WAS A FUCKING RETARD and his intellect was destroyed</br>    <br><br>Taking odds:<br><br>-Iida dies (seems a bit early to off a secondary character but hey)<br><br>-Iida also gets crippled.<br><br>-Iida lives, someone else dies or gets crippled in his place because of his hubris- maximum Iida suffering pretty much.<br><br>-Iida, Midoriya, etc escape without permanent damage, Iida is expelled from Yuuei and stripped of his ability to become a licensed hero for going vigilante.<br><br>-Iida actually kills Stain in the end, heel-turns to vigilante, becomes enemy for future arcs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't they say Stain killed 17 heros and crippled 23? How could he have reached that number if he's only visited 7 districts?</br>  <br>Oh, im not at that part of jojo yet</br>  <br>At this point I'm not seeing how Deku is going to be able to help out here. Maybe it's just going to be a fight between Tenya and Stain?</br>  <br>Let it be Grapes, please let it be Grapes</br>  <br>We can assume that there were heroes that have gone after him(police like heroes) and got murdered in the process and that not all of his hero killing was in a district</br>  <br> At least 4 heroes get attacked <br>He could have attacked more than 4 in some.</br></br>  <br>Some heroes probably tried to stop him already, but he only crippled them.<br>That would mean he only missed 4 heroes.</br></br>  <br> Maybe it's just going to be a fight between Tenya and Stain? <br><br>Probably.</br></br></br>  <br><br> At least 4 get attacked <br><br>He fills his district quota with 4 and probably takes out extra if they get in his way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's true</br>  I am somewhat dissapointed in Iida. He seemed like a bright person who would never make halfassed decisions but rather plan out everything ahead with several backup plans. Him suddenly deciding to kill a villain feels a little out of character -to me at least. If I were Iida and I absolutely had to kill Stain, instead of picking a thirdrate hero company and raising a red flag with edgyness, I would have picked the best hero company, go on with my hero studies and learn/train as much as humanly possible while plotting revenge secretly. Maybe even go a little crazy during the time. Then when I am positive I am at my best, I'd try my luck. But now? He barely began his studies and plans to kill an adult hero-killer who killed/crippled heroes abive Iida's league. What makes him think he'd stand a chance? He doesn't even know about Stain's quirk. If he really wants revenge, so be it...but as things are, it just can't end well and he should be able to realize this.  <br><br>Another possibility is that Iida loses, gets captured and wrinklyhands does some Pitou-shenanigans to him in order to make another Noumu.</br></br>  <br>Cool hero, any reason why he wears the mask?</br>  <br><br>That could also happen and would be pretty fucked up. Imagine seeing a half-braindead mutated Iida loaded up with quirks that compliment his speed.</br></br>  <br>It makes sense as its emotions that take over his mind and actions now. Some people-characters think more rationally about it and probably would do what you just said, but not everyone is like this.<br><br>I don't want to apply rl situations here bc people=/=characters even though characters are based in rl and people, but I think that as much as he is doing a big, irrational mistake that will hurt more people than him and his brother (emotionally, to know Iida decided to kill the villain) I think its IC for him to take such an action as well since he is full of anger and hate.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a family matter, anon. We knew that Iida is very proud of his family's legacy, and that he idolizes his older brother. And we know that love, even fraternal love, makes people do crazy things.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br> &gt;The making of a great hero <br> &gt;The making of a great villain <br><br>This is hot-blooded in a strange way</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks !</br>  <br><br>This.</br></br>  <br>His choice of words is way too weak for it to be a simple "Iida gets killed". He is probably going to get his ass kicked and that's it. Probably get hurt but nothing more.</br>  <br>I understand that, I'd be mighty pissed too if someone did that to a family member of mine. What I don't get is why he thinks that he as a student has a chance against a pro villain who killed/crippled pro heroes already. It's like a mouse deciding to kill the cat that ate it's beloved one and not seeing a singe flaw in that plan. For all he knows, Stain could have a quirk similar to Aizawa sensei and make his engine legs useless without effort. Maybe I just think differently -plus I didn't have a tragedy like that happen to me either to influence my emotions.</br>  <br>It's because iida has always seen his big brother as an invincible hero and the best one and idolises him as a god since he was a child.</br>  <br>LIDA OF MURDER</br>  <br> Lida </br>  <br> this guy easily beat the shit out of my godlike invincible idol <br> better go kill him lel </br></br>  <br>Kids are stupid, what can you do. If no one else, he should be the first to realize he stands no chance if he didn't completely wipe the tournament clean.</br>  It's obvious, guys.<br><br>Iida gets caught in a bad fight with Stain but Deku with his newfound understanding for OFA will save him in the nick of time.<br><br>Iida will be bitter about Deku saving him cause he felt Deku interrupted him and of course pride issues and shit causing more edgy rift between the two.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's his brother, of course he's gonna be mad.</br>  he may be thinking Stain got his bro off guard or something  <br>KANEDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</br>  <br>Iida says he knows he can't beat Stain, but he can't help but pursue him.</br>  <br>He is more used to focusing it than spreading it.</br>  <br>You're comparing magazine raws to volume raws you dumb cunt</br>  <br>I don't like where this is going to Iida</br>  <br>Do we have the preview for the next issue?<br>Is BnHA getting the cover for the 1 year on Jump?</br></br>  <br>A new series is getting the cover next week.</br>  <br>Poor horikoshi, hasn't gotten the cover since debuting</br>  <br>It got cover for chapter 23.</br>  <br>i fucking called it<br>I wish I was wrong though</br></br>  <br><br>Pretty sure that MANY people called it.</br></br>  <br>His hair is green probably.</br>  <br>I'm comparing the scans to the magazine spoilers we get before the raws come out, and to the jap magazine scans.</br>  <br>Compare and contrast. Even with the shit compression, in this raw Mina has a nose and bellybutton.</br>  <br>but he had no powers, which was the interesting part</br>  <br> Black clover <br> Threads <br>I mean, maybe in homothreads.<br><br>There is nothing to discuss about it because how generic it is, here is spoilers for the next chapters:<br><br>Bad guy has a bit more of bawstory<br>MC beats him up with his powerup<br>MC group gets a star<br>MC rival is pretty much a statue<br>MC Yells a lot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So Justice Lords, then?</br>  <br> MC Yells a lot. <br>And has sparkles eyes. Which is SO funny they do it every issue.</br></br>  <br>That's because he's homo.<br><br>At least sometimes (rarely) he gets called out on being a fucking loudball.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Invisible girl is going commando. </br></br></br>  <br>I thought we were going to see crowbro and jesus girl this chapter?</br>  <br>Tenya is kill isn't he?</br>  <br>I'm going to shock you anon, but not all spoilers are true.</br>  <br> everybody thinks he's dead <br> this is Deku's big fuck <br> Iida turns into Red Hood </br></br></br>  <br>Well, she can afford it.</br>  <br><br><br>Chinascans always fucking forget Mina's nose.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm glad those spoilers were fake. We didn't need to spend chapters seeing where every student went.</br>  <br>But I need to see more Mei.</br>  <br>She's too busy making babies</br>      <br><br>Tenya will probably get someone innocent killed while fighting Stain and will have to go full Batman from that point onwards</br></br>  <br> Dat Jirou <br><br>That page gave me a knee fetish, I shit you not</br></br></br>  <br><br>She can't help it</br></br>  <br>This would be real hot  IF I COULD FUCKING SEE HER. </br>  <br> one sock slightly wrinkled <br>unf</br></br>  <br> He can't see the girl <br><br>You blind son?</br></br></br>    <br><br> orihime nipples <br><br><br>fff yes</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>is that guy deku's dad? looks like a nice outfit for a fire breather<br><br>maybe he died in action and that's why Deku got obsessed with heroes</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only the pure of heart can see her true appearance.<br>Sorry, anon.</br></br>  <br/>  <br><br>I doubt it. Midoriya's dad has only been mentioned in passing... I imagine the angle is the usual- he's a salaryman and is literally never ever home. Which kinda marks Horikoshi as older than he is...that's not really as much of a thing anymore in Japan.</br></br>  <br>Kubo better start drawing some final swords and titties. He's basically being humored at this point for having a long running series. At last place they won't give him five more years to slack.</br>  <br>I want more Kaminari and Todoroki.</br>  <br>I want more froppy</br>  <br>Her as well.</br>  I want to lick ochako's eyebrows  We need a DxD thread. So let's have a DxD thread.<br><br>Reminder that all DxDs are a best  including Asia  but Rossweisse is super-best.<br><br>Recent news includes v20's cover being posted and v20 spoilers should be out in 15 days.<br><br>Oh yeah, and friendly reminder that DxD might get licensed in less than 72 hours.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> yet <br>*but</br></br>  <br>Seems like a good time to debut this.<br><br>If you don't like it why would you be in a DxD thread?<br><br>On 4chan the answer is troll.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like the franchise.<br>I do not like Season 3 or how it was handled.<br>Find the stick firmly lodged up your own asshole.<br>And either remove it or shove it up even further and hopefully impale your brain.</br></br></br></br>  <br>People are saying that EX takes place after BorN or Vol.7 at the time. So before Vol.9, which is why only a couple of Issei's kids he has with the girls are present. I'm not so sure if that's the case however, but we will see on the 24th. And saving Asia is more of a secondary objective to the main, which is stopping the event which causes the future war from happening.</br>  <br>Ok I can deal with a well articulated opinion. I withdraw my claim of troll. That said I disagree with you but we can handle that.</br>  Mio Honda is perfect.  <br><br>Her face is so straight, she is dead serious</br></br>  Just binged this animu.<br><br>Mio is a shit, Uzuki should have been the leader. She's the only one who has at least some characteristics worthy of being a top idol. Her speech to P-san when she had a fever was probably the highlight of the whole show, and was the driving force for him to wake the fuck up and actually get his ass producing talent like he was there to do in the first place. Uzuki was never worried about herself, she was always about supporting the people around her, which is why her trademark is a smile. An incredibly simple, yet extraordinarily powerful symbol of uplifting and providence. Truly a perfect idol. Only one who comes close is Minami because she unified the girls, but that makes her more of a coach than an idol.</br></br>  is the new game region locked too?<br>should I register now that they are accepting preregistrations before it launches?</br>  <br>That happens all the time.

It kinda went full supernatural and not so much about mango.</br></br></br>  <br>You dropped it at the fucking beginning then? And it wasn't appealing because you have shit taste.</br>  I like beck, but I thought the music was fucking terrible.  <br>you obviously weren't made to hit in america</br>  <br>Only the first chapters were about mango exclusively, then prophecy happened and it started supernatural.<br>Plus there are arcs, they were on an island doing supernatural stuff, when they get back(haven't read it in a while maybe they already went back) they're going full into manga again.</br></br>  Well then.  <br>What about this part?</br>  <br>Was the next chapter the one where they are passionately kissing in bed? Because that may be my favorite, looking forward to that one.</br>  <br>Has Rin go so far as kissing him in the latest raw?</br>  <br>learn japanese<br>problem solved</br></br>  why was she handing out candies during the speech?
