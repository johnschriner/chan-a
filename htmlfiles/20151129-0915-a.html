[ Post your best cinderella gurl aidoru  I want to do adventurous things with her.<br><br>And by adventurous I mean nakadashi on her unsafe day.</br></br>  <br>The one who voices Shizuka Kuonji.</br>  It lasted a second, but she was there  <br>You mean this embodiment of purity?</br>  <br>Is she taking the trash out in her pajamas?</br>  <br>Yes. Because she's not just an idol, she's a responsible big sister.</br>   Momoka's CD drama track <br><br>hnnnnnggggggg<br><br>Need... new heart...</br></br></br></br>  It's happening. Beltzipper confirmed for CD debut.  This baby batter banshee too.<br><br>Rest of the batch is Yuka, Yumi and Yui (all already voiced)</br></br>  Starting to like Natsuki more than the Usamin, but both darlings.<br>Natsuki, Rina, Takumi CDs can't come soon enough.</br>    <br>Cool.<br><br>RIP to our memes.</br></br></br>   RIP to our memes <br><br>You mean the ones that didn't already die when Momoka got voiced?</br></br>  <br>I want to empty the entire contents of my testicles inside Kirari.</br>  <br>It got passed on to Kyoko.</br>  <br>Which Cinderella would you girl?</br>  <br>Me too. She makes my dick happy happy.</br>  <br><br>Sexual thoughts about Kirari are wrong. You should be having them about Anzu instead.</br></br>  <br>Pajamiria is a miriacle of the universe.</br>  What will be his faith? Who will be on the next cover?  <br>can you post the TG:re page on marumaru? My gook game is weak</br>  <br>It doesn't matter they won't post anything until Wednesday.</br>  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>Ayyy lmao.</br>  I actually wouldn't mind if we get the chapter the same time as the japanese since this would reduce the chances of degenerate cancer sending pics to Ishida before the chapter is even released.  Will Pochaco ever get an anime like Sonico did?  <br>Stop that.</br>  <br>Nah. I have my fetishes, like feet, armpits, and necks. Those things don't detract from the appeal of a woman, though. Same can't be said about your whale's fat rolls.</br>  Imagine Pochaco lying on top of you.  <br>I'd rather she sit on my face.</br>  <br> feet <br> armpits <br> necks <br>What the fuck?

She's a character for the anime Magi.</br>  <br>could you please kindly die?</br>  <br>I've seen the anime and read the manga, but I've never heard of this "Morgiana" character before.</br>    <br>kek</br>  <br>I don't get it.</br>  <br>You're just plain out lying, or acting dumb(or both?). :P</br>  <br> (You) </br>  Lum has the best everything.  NYARUKO<br>N<br>Y<br>A<br>R<br>U<br>K<br>O</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Obligatory.  <br>Who is what is that is? :L</br>  <br>what are those sparkles coming from her crotch</br>  <br>hownew.ru / Fuck off with your "ironic" shitposting.</br>  <br>saenai heroine no sodatekata<br>eriri or utaha</br></br>  <br> still no Saki doujins </br>  <br>They're coming from the anklets.</br>  <br>I know these two guys are the MC's. But I've never seen this "Morgiana" person you speak of with them. Maybe you are referring to someone else?</br>  <br>Joke would work better if OP was talking about main characters only, but saying Morgiana isn't even a side character isn't really working.</br>    <br>Fair enough. I'll just say she isn't a main character.</br>  <br>The important thing is that now you DO know of her.. I wish I could just wear a filter of a sort, to just block out stupid "trolling" attempts.</br>  <br> The important thing is that now you DO know of her. <br>Know of who?</br></br>  <br>THIGHS</br>  <br> implying she doesn't have great thighs <br><br>Emi is probably a pro at giving thigh jobs.</br></br></br>      Eizan takes the bait like a 5 year old. You didn't even try,tsukuda.  <br>Power of love was established as a real deal in the first very chapter.</br>  You and me baby ain't nothing but mammals<br>so let's do it<br>like they do it<br>on the Discovery Channel</br></br></br>  <br>To be honest though, these last 2 (3 if you count the current one too) SERIOUS arcs pretty much mean Gintama is ending. All the "loose" ends are being tied up so it'd make sense that the comedic daily-life shorts aren't there. <br><br>But last week's Gundam bit really cracked me up. You gotta give it to the gorilla for being able to still stick those humorous bits in without it feeling out of place.</br></br></br>  I'm surprised Tosh didn't notice the continuity error with the backswinging hand, give how much emphasis the scene has. On the previous page, Eizan uses his left arm to do the gesture, then in the 4 panels on the followup page, it's his right arm.    Kobeni is a good girl.  <br>Furry slut.</br>  She might be the best wife but I'd still fuck her sister over her. And Suetsugi.  Kobeni is a best girl  What a boring fucking Mary-sue. She ruined the show just with her presence.  <br>kill yourself</br>  Where were you when Sogo get in the robot?  <br>Dropped this but keeping an eye open to see if there is any reason to finish it. This is not helping.</br>  <br><br> killing the only slightly interesting character  <br><br>every time</br></br></br></br>  <br>the fuck</br>  <br>Holy fuck my sides went flying</br>  <br>But Roman is still alive</br>  SHINDOL<br><br>http://exhentai.org/s/ed40928120/87<wbr>8066-3<br><br>NSFW <br>This is just fucked up dont touch my fucking elf you cunt</br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>I kinda knew Shindol would opt for the gurofag path with this. Pity he went for that. He's kinda like Fatalpulse, in that his art in general is pretty hot, but he tends to shit the bed with his attempts to put unpleasant twists into his stuff to get a rise out of people.</br>  <br>Yeah that one with the Gender Bending.<br>Literally got so popular they animated it.</br></br>  The black framing shows that it's all a dream.<br><br>I guess he didn't want to completely go down the rabbit hole.</br></br>  <br> be a mongrel newfag at /a/ that doesn't know shit about how to get through the sadpanda <br><br>Sigh...</br></br></br>  <br> snuff <br>Welp.</br></br>  Are Jackfags the new Doffyfags?<br><br>I already see ''Admiral level'' and other delusions being thrown around. I wonder how long it will take before they get BTFO again.</br></br>  Tontattas were a crucial part of the arc (secret passage way to Sugar, creating SMILE for Doffy, Mansherry prevented casualties among the citizens) and may be even more relevant later when we learn more about devil fruits. Also they are a part of Luffys fleet now. Case closed.  <br> Looks like he was some mafia boss <br>His character is literally based on a mafia boss, of course he looks like one.</br></br>  <br>The hate isn't bait, why would someone even bait with something like that? If one wanted to bait they'd do it with something people liked.</br>  <br><br>Really? I think Tontattas were bearable. If you want to cut down on the bullshit in Dressrosa. Remove 95% of all, Kyros, Rebecca, Violet screen time and entirely remove Bellamy. That should make the arc 60 chapters or so.</br></br>  <br>I hope you reply to me with that gif one day.<br><br>It will make my day.
