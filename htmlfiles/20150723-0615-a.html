[ The new dragon ball reminded me that I feel really bad for Videl.<br>She likes Gohan because he was the cool fighter who defeated Cell, but Gohan is actually a massive faggot who hates to fight.<br>If only she had been born 2 decades before, Goku could have ended with her instead of that insufferable bitch called Chi-Chi.</br></br>   implying Goku didnt cuck Gohan   She wasn't forced to marry him so why would you pity her? It was her decision and she seems satisfied with her choice.  <br> She wasn't forced to marry him <br>How do you know that?<br>She got pregnant of course she was forced.</br></br></br>  they are both shit now  <br>But Goku is an awful person and a worse husband.</br>  That's definitely not why she liked Gohan, though.   Talking shit about Chi Chi <br>bitch please</br>  <br>What are you talking about? She liked him because he had a pure heart and did his best to help those around him.<br><br>If all she wanted was some muscleman who goes around fighting people then she would have hooked up with one of them ages ago. Don't forget that her father runs a ring a the allegedly best human martial artists on earth.</br></br></br>  <br>Implying videl isn't just as bad now</br>  <br>Loli Chi-Chi is the best. Adult Chi-Chi is kind of a cunt, though.</br>  <br>She's fat.</br>  <br> Making your little girl to go around town dressed like that <br>Literally asking for it.</br></br>  <br>This. <br>OP is clearly an idiot, probably projecting his own feelings onto a cartoon character.</br></br>  <br>Gohan did like to fight though. She even caught him fighting criminals.<br>Gohan doesn't like fighting for his life, but he actually seemed kind of excited for the World Martial Arts tournament. He even looked forward to the training.<br>Gohan just wants to focus on his studies so he's cut down on the training, because any worthwhile training is something that takes All day apparently   Gohan had to take off school to train for the World Tournament  </br></br></br>  <br><br> This Chichi is absurd, the Old Chichi is absurd, the better Chichi is the one during the last tournament against Piccolo, and if she wanted more links with her husband, should should continue to fight instead to appear and old woman even if is more young than Bulma.</br></br>  <br>arent loli's meant to be chubby ?</br>  <br>I don't really think its right to say that he was genuinely excited about the tournament, he wasn't really excited about the tournament itself as much as just seeing his friends there.</br>  What if Gogeta SSJ4 is actually Super Saiyan God 4 Gogeta?<br><br> SSj4 / Basic Saiyan = Black Hair <br> Super Saiyan God = Red Hair <br> Super Saiyan God 4 =    Red Hair  </br></br></br></br>  <br>*And by Super Saiyan God 4 i mean Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan 4</br>  <br>Why did his hair turn red, anyway?</br>  <br>Thats what this theory is based on, Anon. We've got no answer.<br><br>This one would be an answer.</br></br></br>  <br>I really hate what Toriyama did to her character. I really would have liked to see her keep up with her fighting/training in her Dojo. I don't care about strength specifically but I really liked her tomboyish attitude. Now she's just a bland, no personality generic housewife and I really don't like it.<br><br>It's similar to how I feel about 18 being shafted in the Revival of F movie with such a sad excuse for why she didn't get to fight even though she's way stronger than Krillin.<br><br>Toriyama is just shit with female characters in general, they either just get shafted and sidelined or forgotten entirely (Sorry Launch).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Now she's just a bland, no personality generic housewife and I really don't like it. <br><br>You really don't know women. Every time you hear women being professional or careerists and such? That is all an act. Because all women want to be wives. Being wives is THE retirement package for a twat.<br><br>After she's a wife she has gained a sucker/slave to provide for her so the mask comes off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You sound like you have issues dude.<br><br>Maybe you should see a therapist, seriously, talk to a professional about your girl issues.</br></br></br>  <br>But she's the one treating nerd Gohan like her personal fucktoy.</br>  What if Videl and Gohan were having sex and when he came he accidentally released a kamehameha wave from his dick?  When you think about it, Gohan was the polar opposite of Videl's father. Her father was arrogant and prideful, he took credits for the achievements of other and was an all-around attention whore. On the other hand Gohan saved the world but didn't bring any attention to it. He fought crime but preferred to do it anonymously while living as an average guy. Considering that Videl hated her father it's no surprise that Gohan had qualities that interested her.  <br> After she's a wife she has gained a sucker/slave to provide for her so the mask comes off <br>Videl is the breadwinner though. Gohan is living of Videl's fortune</br></br>  <br>That doesn't even make sense.</br>  Why do people like the Artificial Human arc so much?  Goku should have ended up with Bulma  <br>Goku fired a kamehameha wave from his feet.<br>I don't see why it doesn't make sense that Gohan could make one with his dick.</br></br>  <br>Because shit like Terminator 2 was popular then.</br>  <br>Toriyama's editor was the president of the Goku/Bulma fanclub and even support Toriyama when he decided to let Goku grow up but Toriyama trolled him</br>  <br>So, I have that guy to blame for taking my fun adventure and turning it into power levels?</br>  <br>Torishima? He was opposed to the idea of Goku growing up, and then Toriyama warned him that he wouldn't continue the story if Goku couldn't become an adult.</br>  <br>I read it was Shueisha's big guys the ones against Goku growing up but Toriyama's editor supported the idea for having a Bulma end. Apparently, he liked romance and he always pushed it on shounen titles</br>  <br> as much as just seeing his friends there. <br><br>I just realized that most of Gohans friends are just Goku's friends.<br><br>Poor guy only had Dende (and this little dude was also constantly busy being Kamisama) until he went to highschool and met Videl and the other two whattheirfaces, Pencil and Ereaser?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Projecting thia much <br><br>Anon, I think you have a problem.<br><br>Also, It's Videl the one who's providing Gohan.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Toriyama is just shit with female characters in general, they either just get shafted and sidelined or forgotten entirely (Sorry Launch). <br><br><br>No one can be as worse as Masashi "Hack" Kishimoto</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, god form is weak to be comparable to ssj 4.</br>  <br>If we are talking animal instinct level kinda shit then you've got a point anon.<br>Chi Chi as an example. Women instinctively try to get the best genes for their children and try to insure that they survive to make grand children.<br>She married and had kids with the most powerful man in the world who took out Frezia and Buu. Given how powerful Gohan is with how he handled Cell she has techially done her job from a nature standpoint<br>When it comes to Videl she's got Gohan who is probably one of the strongest people on the planet. Once she has kids with him he'll probably want to stick around due to how shit of a father Goku was to him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>SSJ4 got cut by falling glass in GT</br>  <br>Krilin and the rest of the gang are like Gohan's cool uncles while Piccolo is his non-shit dad.</br>  <br>That's not the point. You can't just accidentally Kamehameha.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Fkb<wbr>xNypK6ds</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Man I love this OP but 0:13 bothers me more than it should<br><br>GOKU of all people just had a heartwarming and memorable bonding moment with his son, and Chichi bitches him out for it. He finally takes a break from being dead for 2 seconds to do something dad-like, and she gives him shit. Just can't win with this lady.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying you wouldnt fuck the hell out of horny older chichi </br>  <br>The new OP isn't as iconic as Chala-Head-Chala.</br>  <br><br>Well obviously not. Chala is a generational timepiece, people grew up with it when DBZ was new. You can't manually recreate that kind of impact.</br></br>  ITT: post edgy panels from any manga  <br>So, Berserk thread?</br>  <br> still people thinking guts is a better person than Griffith </br>  <br>Nobody thinks hes a better person, they are both horrid people, griffith is just more charismatic and willing to manipulate and sacrifice everyone for his own personal gain. Guts is a shit person for other reasons.</br>    <br>Berserk isn't edgy</br>  <br>It surprises me how Hellsing never makes it to these "edgy meymey" threads. It's like some teenagers secondaries make these threads</br>  <br>Yes and the sky isn't blue.</br>  <br>Guts has better reasons to be a shit person</br>  <br>The sky is technically not blue at night</br>  <br>How is it edgy to use the historical past of a character based upon a historical person?</br>  <br>Someone doesnt know history. Vlad was actually raped, probably hundreds of times as a child.</br>  <br>Griifith has been tortured during 1 year , i think it's a good reason to become insane .</br>  <br><br> Implying Vlad wasn't a literal edgelord </br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>Griifith going insane was justified but Guts had all but two of his friends killed because of someone who he saw as a very close friend after saving that friend from the torture, then having his eyes gouged out again because of Griifith summoned demons and saw his girlfriend raped in a pool of their friends blood and who raped her? Griifith, both have their reasons to be horrible people, but Guts has way more</br>  <br>Berserk is supposed to be edgy.</br>  You can choose basically any page from this manga if you'd like.

I hate Kongou more than anything in the world. She is a meme character of the worst type. How is it even possible for one character to be such a massive piece of shit? Everything about Kongou is awful. Her design is incredibly unattractive and her personality is trashy. I can't think of a single redeeming quality that she has. Her voice is probably the worst part about her. Any time I have to hear her talk it's like nails on a chalkboard and her retarded broken English isn't cute, it's disgusting. It's not even possible to make her any worse than she already is.<br><br>Any time I'm looking for porn of this series and I see something featuring Kongou, I get upset. All that talent being wasted on such a useless and terrible character fills me with frustration and agony. The only kind of acceptable H-doujins with Kongou are brutal rape and gangbang doujins because that's all she deserves. Even then it's still a waste of talent. Kongou isn't even worthy of shitty amateur Deviantart scribbles.<br><br>Kongou is a worthless, obnoxious, retarded fuckup of a character. There aren't even enough adjectives in the English language to accurately describe just how shitty she is. If I could have just one wish from a magic genie, it would be to erase Kongou from existence. Nothing would make me happier.</br></br></br></br>  <br>For some reason I think a submarine episode should be a The Great Escape homage.

I liked how he kept telling that slut to fuck off. <br><br>I forgot what episode i was on though.</br></br>  <br>it's a shit show, death note is much better</br>  Might not be for you, then<br>Maybe you'd like K-On or something</br>  <br>The manga is much better than the anime, you should probably have read that instead.<br><br>But really you just have shit taste.</br></br></br>  Weren't they making an HBO show of this?  <br>If so Dr.Tenma will fuck every person he saves while searching for Johann.</br>  <br>explain to me what's so good about this show. The melodrama is cringeworthy as fuck though that should be expected with all weaboo trash, the plot is fucking contrived as fuck, why is tenma the only doctor that can perform surgery without killing anyone, how did a fucking 10 year old poison 3 adults with candy. this show is fucking laughable i have much better taste than you</br>  <br>Congratulations, you have shit taste. Watch Aldnoah Zero or Samurai Flamenco instead.</br>  <br> how did a fucking 10 year old poison 3 adults with candy <br>Johann was awake at this point I'm pretty sure, so he could have just poisoned it and then offered it to them.</br></br>  <br><br> Del Toro as director <br><br>I have faith</br></br></br></br>  <br> monster as source material <br>now it's gone</br></br>  <br>I bet 5 autism bucks that Dr.Tenma will not look like a hobo like in OP's pic but will just get generic action hero scruff.</br>  <br>nah it's fucking garbage. try bebop or miyazaki for some quality anime</br>  <br> the guy who made one good movie in his life <br>I don't</br></br>  It doesn't get much better if it bores you at this point. Dropped it at episode 20 or so and read the manga instead. The pacing was better but the Story in general wasn't really captivating, would take 20th century boys over monster any day of the week.  <br>The pacing just gets worse from here. It's shit. I don't understand its popularity.<br>Even past the fact that it is boring because of how slow it is, the scenario isn't all that great, nor the ost, nor the designs, nor the characters.<br>20th century boy and pluto are better choices.</br></br></br>  <br> comparing SamFlam to Aldnoah zero </br>  <br>I quite like the ost i'll give them that, nothing else hooks me in</br>  <br>you're a fucking pleb, anime's not for you</br>  <br>Try Sword Art Online out OP I think it'd suit you better</br>  <br>No it really doesn't. I tried my best to watch it, hoping there was exceptional twist hidden at the end or something to justify everyone's dickriding, and ended up dropping it around ep 37 where the MC does the most retarded thing imaginable.<br><br>I somehow picked it up months later and watched it to the end - suprise suprise, nothing. It's utter garbage meant for new-age edginess and quasi-philosophical quasi-intellectual teenagers. That, or it's the longest running 2deep4you joke in anime.<br><br>Here's to the 24 hours of my life I'm never getting back.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Johan has a cynical yet very accurate understanding of a person's nature, so he assumed the Director would steal something from him while he lay comatose (just to satisfy his egomania) and guessed it would eb the candy. After discerning that it is just a matter of putting some medical material on it in a large enough quantity to kill a grown man. I believe it was muscle relaxer or something, he uses it multiple times in the series.</br>  Naoki Urasawa's characters are all nonsensical and illogical. You have to suspend disbelief because if you try to make sense of it you'll find too many holes.  <br><br>The manga is garbage, never watched the anime.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, good idea. General public definitely won't think of it as Hannibal rip-off.<br> Del Toro <br>Fuck that hack, by the way.</br></br></br>  <br>hannibal's much better than monster and even that isn't great</br>  <br>Most 'bad' western TV shows would be AOTS anime. That Dexter season with the Trinity Killer would probably be dickrode for life as the best anime ever made.</br>  I like the source material but the direction of the adaptation is horrid. <br>Everything is so drawn out it's unbelievable.</br>  <br> I'd rather have Dexter season 7 anime without Isaak dying so anticlimactically. </br>  <br>I don't think even got past episode 5 of Monster, I was expecting a cool premise and amazing characters and I got some boring fucking drama, you could find a better plot in soap opera.<br><br> Docutah Tenma you must make this hard choice between the Mayor and this child. Btw, you're the only half decent doctor in this hospital choose wisely because there's no other fucking doctors here. </br></br></br>  <br> isn't great <br>That's understatement of the century. Hannibal is fucking garbage.<br>I'd say it's one of the worst shows I've ever seen.</br></br></br>  <br>I gave up at the start of Season 5 where he kills a man for no reason and that was never explained nor did he feel guilty. I did see the ending of season 7 where he drives into a Tornado and becomes a lumberjack?</br>  <br> lumberjack <br>That's 8 not 7.<br>7 was generally shit just like 8, but it had one of the hypest antagonists on the show ever second only to Trinity and maybe Doakes.<br><br>Too bad he was killed of because the actor had to play in some mediocre capeshit instead and scheduling conflicts ensued.<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=TLQH<wbr>u7PiymE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hannibal at the start was fairly decent even if MC had magic autistic detective powers. It only got retarded when Hannibal tries to frame him and he get's put in that mental hospital.</br>  <br>I don't think anyone really beats Doakes, he got so close the writers writ themselves into a corner and had to kill him off. It was so bullshit how they made that chick kill him by blowing up that shed instead of Dexter because he's a good serial killer who dindu nuffin.</br>  <br> Hannibal at the start was fairly decent <br>No, it wasn't. It was bland CSI-like garbage with retarded-looking "artsy" murders which were retarded from the fucking start.<br>Oh, and characters repeating words signifying plot points as unsubtly as possible is really goddamn dumb.<br>If I'll hear that Dutch faggot saying the word "friend' in his shit accent I'll bleed from my ears.<br><br>Hannibal is fucking shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought the 'artsy' murders, no matter how retarded, were pretty fun. It wasn't a 100% realistic show anyway so having weird,impossible murders was a breath of fresh air from normal CSI shit. It's only when the plot started to take them seriously and when you got episodes like that furry suit one that it became shit. <br><br>But,I'm not a massive TV buff and I watch what's entertaining until I get bored so I suppose it's objectively shit but still enjoyable if you turn your brain off.</br></br></br>  <br> furry suit <br>Literally the only two good episodes in the entire show as long as you treat them as something that belongs in a slasher flick than in a cop drama.<br>Yes, it's stupid from real-life standpoint but this was pretty fucking tense which is not something you can say about actual horror movies nowadays.<br>The rest of the murders are just boring edgy shit with no substance other than trying to be outlandish as possible..</br></br></br></br>  I stopped around episode ~30 a while ago. I dunno, I liked it, but it bored me at the same time.<br><br>Also, why is this the only anime without rule 34, but with fucking huge noses instead? Is the size of the nose reverse-proportional to how sexy the character is to japanese folk?</br></br>  <br>It's one of those manga/anime that are average with a not so common plot but probably for their uniqueness get a really loud fan base, the which overrates the hell out of it and in the end make it worse for the viewer.

They need to be rescanned in better quality.</br>  Just got to chapter 79 but had to take a break, this shit right here blew my mind. did this shit blow your mind as much as mine? like this level of backward ntr just hit me on a emotional/moral level more than any typical ntr hurting me on a instinctual level. just so fucked up man  <br>Of Hana's pee?</br>  <br>More like.<br>  realize VP is underage. </br></br>  <br>Nah, man<br>VP and P are atleast 18 or otherwise, showing their nips would be illegal in jap</br></br>  <br><br><br>Pretty sure I remember reading that all the characters in the manga are 18+ actors and actresses that are simply playing underaged teenagers in the story.<br><br>Don't remember which chapter I read that though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>straight from her.... medusa? </br>  <br>Back in the Lazy Scans Days, they were notorious for littering the pages with annotations and comments as if they were research paper drafts.</br>  <br>Thats not from a chapter what the fuck? You read that off the marumaru korean page</br>  <br>In just over 30 chapters you're going to lose touch with reality.</br>  <br>Hana is 2 or 1 years younger</br>  <br>They also included pin-ups that came with the magazine, translated Hiramoto Akira's comments on manga pages, and included alternate translations, if a passage can be read in two ways.<br><br>I kind of miss knowing what Hiramoto actually thought as he drew the pages.</br></br></br>  He really needs to get right in the medusa and drink all its glorious golden contents.   everyone forgets Chiyo's birthday <br> Chairman doesn't even know why he is rushing but deep down knows he is forgetting something important <br>I hope Chiyo turns evil or some shit.</br></br>  <br> ...d-did you just <br>Chairman is rushing to get back to prepare his Daughter's Birthday</br></br>  <br>If the conclusion was that Snow White was actually Mari, and not Chiyo, then Chiyo must be the witch.<br><br>Oh boy, this might get messy.</br></br></br>  Where is the butthole? Buttholes should be okay to draw since you can argue it's not a genital or sexual in nature.  <br>It's a shame that TL Notes are vilified by the Crunchyroll crowd nowadays.</br>  <br>if chiyo turns evil it means kiyoshi can drop her and gets freed up for more interesting/deserving characters. I am ok with this.</br>  <br>Isn't Chiyo's birthday still a few days away though? <br><br> Will Mari drag Kiyoshi into preparing for it? </br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Kiyoshi would help out even if Mari didn't ask him to.<br>Then,  for petty vengeance birthday gift, Kate would give Chiyo the Ouroboros and Hana pics </br></br>  <br>Except that he doesn't know about her birthday at all.</br>  so, OU PBR Mk II, who hype here?  <br>Didn't Chiyo tell Kiyoshi that her birthday happens on Tanabata during their sumo date? I have a faint recollection of that, but I might be wrong</br>  <br>Nope. The sumo date went from talking about yokozuna to plain musubi to  Disgusting </br>  <br>None of the boys know of her birthday.</br>  <br> I have a faint recollection of that <br>What the hell? Tanabata wasnt even mentioned till 130 something chapters when gakuto said something and then again when kiyoshi was having his journey under the futon.</br></br>  What could have been  <br>It will be, just wait for the blu-rays</br>  <br>Pretty much a preview of the BDs, which will be released when?</br>  <br>I think its says 9/30 right there <br><br>right?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not a smart person, thanks</br>  Next chapter is going to be pretty good.<br><br>These next few chapters will resolve many questions around the series. How exciting.</br></br>  <br> resolve many questions around the series <br>There are only 3 questions that will be answered.<br><br> Who is Andre's real mistress? <br> What is Kate's trump card? <br> Does Mari like Kiyoshi? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm predicting a Meiko vs Andre battle once Kate let's him go berserk on Mari</br>  <br>kates trump card was using andre</br>  <br>Using Andre was also Mari's trump card.<br>Andre is a giant walking card with a small face.</br></br>  will we ever find out why an all girls school would hold a wet t-shirt contest? am I just thinking too hard about this?  <br>You forget<br><br> Does Chiyo actually know about Hana and Kiyoshi? <br> Does Kiyoshi know that Hana actually likes him? <br> What is Hana's backstory? <br><br>These are most of the big questions in this manga and they will be answered within the next ten chapters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the USC was lying to them.</br>  <br>For the yuri loving students, of course</br>  <br> Your school didn't? I'm sooo sooorry anon. <br><br>My school held a camping trip and one of the games consisted of hosing the opposition. I hope that counts.</br></br></br>  <br>Those are not going to be answered in 10 chapters. Kiyoshi still doesn't realize it; this will be the main conflict going forward for the next 5 years.<br><br><br>Because it's  the Boys Wet T-Shirt Contest. They'll be like targets in a Capture The Flag-style battle royale where the girls try to soak them for points, and then auctioned off for the night to the highest bidder like the last scene of Groundhog Day. </br></br></br></br>  <br>but then what if, theyre getting chased. and they run and hide behind bushes. and the student council orders a charge to finally get them and just as everyone surrounds them, they bust out of the bushes inside a giant 5 man plastic bottle rocket ship tank with water gun turrets and just rule the battlefield, and then later on they take it to the river and hand out the reservation tickets and they finally get all their summer hopes and dreams.</br>  <br>No, they'll be split up into 5 different teams and dragged around the battlefield.</br>  <br><br><br>The time dilation is just going to increase. Soon each chapter will only be a few seconds of their time. The summer won't come in our lifetimes</br></br></br>  <br>flash news: women like boobs too</br>  <br><br>That's Kate.</br></br>  <br>MAybe he'll start adding completely random monologues and images into the normal story events, like what he did when Hana finally  pissed on Kiyoshi. </br>  <br>I was getting into the adventure of Principle Butt. It will turn into a collection of manga with prison school being a side note.</br>   Kiyoshi considers himself boob man <br> chases after flats like Chiyo and Hana  <br> only boy to never show interest in Meiko  <br>Plothole much?</br></br></br>  <br>Did you forgot how happy he was when he joined Mari and Meiko in school prison?</br>  <br>Chiyo isnt flat?</br>  <br><br> My Theories so far <br><br> Who is Andre's real mistress? <br>Risa, He's more dedicated to her than VP<br> What is Kate's trump card? <br>She didn't use Hana and Kiyoshi's photos yet so it might be one of her trump card. Hana's blackmail photos becomes Kate's Trump card for blackmailing her. They need to go deeper<br> Does Mari like Kiyoshi? <br>as?, i can see Mari respecting Kiyoshi but liking him?..nahh<br> Does Chiyo actually know about Hana and Kiyoshi? <br>She's Speculating<br> Does Kiyoshi know that Hana actually likes him? <br>Kiyoshi wouldn't even think about that<br> What is Hana's backstory? <br>isn't obvious? Karate dad and Tea something Mother (or Role Reversal) blah blah blah decency blah blah wear pants</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Boobman in the Outside, Assman in the Inside</br>  Preview for EP 3<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XDh<wbr>bM0cClHE</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Yeah, and he realized that after he saw Mari's ass. He's assman in the closet.</br>  hitchhiker is Kates mother. calling it now.  <br>Time to see Gakuto's ultimate sacrifice animated.</br>  <br> Gakuto's ultimate sacrifice <br>what?</br></br>  <br>where he ruins a perfectly good set of headphones</br>  <br>what a shithead</br>  <br>....<br>The Figurine, Boy. Have you forgotten...ALREADY?</br></br>  <br>that's not for a while though</br>  So, is Hana going to win or what?  <br>No, Mari will win.</br>  <br>No, Chiyo will win</br>  <br>No, Kate will win.</br>  <br>No, shinai fugly will win.</br>  <br>No, Gakuto will win.</br>  <br> No, Chairman will win. </br>  <br>I personally can't wait for the episode where Gakuto shits himself in the middle of class.</br>  <br>No, Andre will win.</br>  <br><br>No, Meiko will win.</br></br>  <br>No, Anzu will win</br>  I feel kind of bad for Kate, the way Mari abused her feelings. <br><br>Also just like in School Rumble  dumbass main guy x blonde tsundere best pairing </br></br>  <br><br>Kate's just as much a bitch as Mari, hard to feel sorry for her.</br></br>  <br>At least she got half an hour in heaven.</br>  <br><br>Is Mari's Cunt really heaven?</br></br>  <br>He has already won.<br><br><br>The bully deserved it.<br>Every part of it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, having sex for the first time, with the person you've made your goddess and obsessed about for years must be a fantastic experience.</br>  I wish to call something to attention, something that everyone has seem to forgotten. It wouldn't be right for us to just move on from anything unless we have been sure to have dealt with them in the fullest sense of the word. That we who consider what has happened until now will also have to remember that we hold the highest responsibility of remembering that the USC was, and still is an enemy of the boys. That they may have begun to help each other doesn't make up for the fact that Mari, Meiko and Hana are no less deserving of punishment than the normal student council. I see that people are starting to empathize, but this is just a case of "The enemy of mine enemy is my friend". After this is solved we still have to remember the immense bullying done from the USC and that they still have within their agenda the expulsion of the boys.  <br><br>That's what the next arc's going to be about.</br></br>  <br> implying the end is not near </br>  <br>First there is that food thing those 3 will do<br><br>Imo in the new arc Mar/Kiyoshi will have more situation like Hana/Kiyoshi, with Chiyo always a cuck, like she deserve.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, is 185 already out? Anyone got a link?</br>  <br> backward ntr <br>You ntrfags sure are obsessed</br></br>  <br>No, Cake-san will win</br>  <br>Why bullying Chiyo? She may be the worst girl for Kiyoshi, but aside from being boring character, she's nice and deserves happiness with some sumo star.</br>  Piss fetish<br><br>Never thought I would see an anime character with one.</br></br>  Prison School needs more lewd content. There's no Mari doujinshi, just only one of Hana.<br>I want to impregnate Mari, where's my hentai.<br><br>Cake&gt;Anzu&gt;Chio</br></br></br>   prison school threads are now pissfag circlejerks <br>Hana ruined everything.</br>  <br> Crying <br> Piss fetish <br>The Fuck!?</br></br></br>  <br><br>look at this fucking square lol</br></br>  <br>Why create lewd content when manga will always look way better? There is that one shitty Kiyoshi/Hana doujin, if that's the alternative, I'll stick to manga.</br>  <br><br>I just want to see Mari and Kate's scene explicitly.</br></br>  <br>Her name's Diamond-san.</br>  <br>Doujin can go further than manga<br>Like  in full details.</br></br>  What is this about  <br> Father is an overdramatic porn addict and assman <br> Sister is a huge misandrist with daddy issues <br><br> Somehow people think that in this family is someone normal. <br> Somehow people think that in this story is someone normal. <br><br>I'm just waiting for Chiyo's mask to shatter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> backward ntr <br>What does this term even mean?</br></br>  <br>are you impying they have never been?</br>  Gentlemen, there is an issued we urgently need to discuss, one which was pending for far too long.<br><br>The issue of the kind of pubic hair each girl has.<br><br>My views on the matter are as follows:<br><br>Mari: properly trimmed into a simple, pleasing shape<br><br>Meiko: fully waxed at all times<br><br>Hana: almost no hair to begin with, just a hint of something growing there<br><br>Chiyo: similar to Mari, albeit more plain than pleasing<br><br>Kate: makes it look like what she presumes Mari has, however it ends up being more base and porn-star like<br><br>Rube Goldberg-chan: full bush<br><br>Risa: full wax<br><br>Cake-chan: similar to Hana, but a bit more pronounced because of darker hair<br><br>Anzu: simple, practical shave<br><br>Complaints and criticism are always welcome.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a school with two repressive student councils and an auschwitz facilities nearby and you question the contest of all things.</br>  <br>He doesn't chase Hana, it's the other way around.<br><br>Chiyo is "the cutest in his class".<br><br>He doesn't show interest in Meiko because he got infatuated with Chiyo. Same with other boys who got girls later.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tears of happiness.</br>  <br> Rube Goldberg-chan <br>who</br></br>  <br>The whole shaved vs. non-shaved debate boils down to one simple observation. Consider the following:<br><br>If the pussy, including the mons pubis, looks good, then you see more of it without pubic hair.<br><br>If the pussy is aesthetically pleasing, then covering it with pubic hair will make you see less of it.<br><br>Contrariwise, if the pubic hair looks good, then why shave it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Daily reminder that Hana's pussy is ultra hairy.</br>  <br> Mari: properly trimmed into a simple, pleasing shape <br>this is exactly what I imagined. A nice little triangle.</br></br>  <br><br>Ah, but you are forgetting one thing. The hair and the pussy can complement each other, thus increasing the overall aesthetic experience.<br><br>Just as a woman wearing erotic clothing can look much sexier than if she were completely naked, so can the right combination of hair and flesh.<br><br>Fully shaved vaginas, just like completely naked women, leave nothing to the imagination, which is why both are predominant in porn.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Contrariwise, if the pubic hair looks good, then why shave it? <br>reading comprehension on /a/</br></br>  <br> backward ntr <br>wouldn't that be a nice guy with a tiny dick turning a slut into a pure loving woman by having a ton of awful sex with her?</br></br>  <br> Hana <br> not ultra hairy <br>Her pussy called medusa for a reason.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes, the reason being it turns Kiyoshi's mushroom into stone.</br></br>  <br>No, that's <br> double backward reversed drift NTR </br></br>  <br>No, in friday ususally realease</br>  <br> Didnt understand the metaphor <br><br>Jesus christ.</br></br></br>  <br><br>To be fair, he might get turned on by excessive bush. All we know is that he likes what he sees.<br><br>I still maintain that this probably accurate as far as Hana is concerned. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> implying those snake hairs are not a sign of jungle on her pussy </br></br>  <br> Snake <br> Reptile <br> Hair </br></br></br>  <br>It's a symbolism for a long pubic hair.</br>  <br>Then you see in the futon chapters that she has no hair there. You are completely missing the point of the medusa metaphor.</br>  <br>Her hair is censored, moron. Hana has ultra bush in there. Stop being in denial. If you can't be a hanafag if you don't love her jungle.</br>  <br><br>And you forgot<br><br>  what is the real face of Joe? </br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a prophetic meta joke about anime character voiced by same VA as snake in monogatari.

Most have already read 183 and 184 by now.</br>  <br>well, I don't think they'll do it so fast cause maybe they werent there, and they need more man for cleaning I think. Also, they use jap. raws which coming out every monday.</br>  So, apparently, the first volume of the manga has been officially released in English yesterday.<br><br>For those of you who want to support him, get on that shit.<br><br>Also,<br> horror manga </br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Amazon staff confirmed for tumblrites that frequent ANN.</br></br>  <br>Still to call it horror, what the fuck</br>  <br>Wow, it's amazing how you came up with that.</br>  <br> Gakuto is now Gackt <br><br>No buy. What in the fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>Tits are too spooky for murrica.</br>  <br><br> the amount of girls drawn in a way to please the male gaze is downright horrifying  <br> what is scary is that girls will get the wrong idea on how relationships are supposed to work <br> there is a well justified fear that unrealistically attractive female bodies will become the norm at the expense of other body-types <br><br>There, bam. I can do this shit in my sleep.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There is that one shitty Kiyoshi/Hana doujin <br>Implying JUN has a shitty doujin</br></br>    <br>Kiyoshi is full of shit, news at 11.</br>  <br>The boys were clearly creeps and rapists</br>  <br>I do agree that Kate will try to blackmail Hana to get To Mari.

Yet, fuck this shipperfags who are, ironically, on topic.</br>   PURIPURIZUN, AI NO PURIZUN   This is probably a common question, but only I read the manga recently up to the current chapter.<br>Is every one just waiting for the BDs or is it worth watching now?</br>  <br>Watch it now, and if nipples matter that much to you, wait until Wizard releases a compilation of all the nudity.</br>  <br>The fucker has been working just fine with the previous audience he has if you give him more money you turn them into lazy pieces of shit</br>  <br>You can pretty much tell what's being censored, so if you don't mind not seeing nipples, I'd recommend watching now</br>  <br> It's the work of the committee. They are yuri and/or lewd. </br>  <br> delusional shipper <br><br><br>She wears pants underneath her skirt for a reason, you know? She's clearly uncomfortable with her lower region and overgrown pubic hair, which regrows quickly. She has a stinky wild jungle of a pussy and that's why Kiyoshi called it a medusa.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Mostly looking forward to voiced scenes enhancing the comedy, sorta like how I prefer Gintama anime because of seiyuus.<br>Nipples aren't that big a deal, I prefer other girls to the VP anyway.</br></br></br>  <br><br> I'm entitled to get shit for free, and anyone wishing to support the creator is literally Hitler <br><br>Someone get this hothead out of here!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Heres your reply shitposter</br>  <br> im a cocksucker that doesnt ever think about of the consequences <br><br>but ok you fucking moron, go "support" your favorite "artists" and watch as they stop updating their shit because you have enabled a lavish NEET lifestyle for them.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The nipples are not the problem, the frame-ruining beams of light are.</br></br>  <br>The seiyuus are on point, with Hana and Kiyoshi standing out the most. Sayaka Ohara seems to be doing a fine Mari, but I'm still not used to it</br>  <br>What about the fact that you don't understand metaphors have anything to do with being a shipper?!</br>  <br> muh shitposting <br>If you have nothing to add to the discussion, then fuck off.</br></br>  <br> What is shitposting <br><br>Report and move on.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You do know you have to be 18+ to be posting here? You can enjoy saying naughty words with your little buddies after class.</br></br>  Fuck this shit is so good I started yesterday and marathoned it i'm on 179 right now. Hana is the best girl  <br>You're the one who doesn't understand metaphors. You are either retarded or just trolling.</br>  <br>cool retort fucko, you can stop replying now. I will.</br>  <br>There is a guy that frequently lurks these threads so mad at hana breaking his self insert delusion it is as if she pissed on this guy himself.</br>  <br>If Hana is good that's a lot of incentive to dive right in.</br>  <br>It's probably THK, he always shits up on those type of girls and almost always aims for girls like Chiyo.<br>The irony here is that he calls shipperfags 'that vermin term cancer' in these threads while shitting up the thread with his own shipfaggotry.</br></br>  <br><br>Calm down friend, your bottom will develop an inflammation if go on like this.</br></br>  <br> Medusa metaphor clearly indicating turning dick to stone as even the MC specifies this himself with "hardest ive ever been" <br> Retard thinks its about hair <br> Starts calling people hanafags for getting the metaphor wrong because hes a retard shitposter </br></br></br>  <br>Yea hes a pretty pathetic piece of shit and is always ontop of threads with similiar characters, his room must make people drop dead with the smell alone.</br>  <br>Kiyoshi got hard, because Hana has a wild jungle there. How hard is that to understand?</br>  <br>Go fuck yourself THK.</br>  <br>She wears pants under them because she's athletic and modest. And both her panties and pants are fairly tight, so if she doesn't keep it down, it'll get uncomfortable. <br>She may not be bald, but she has to keep them short, most athlete s do.</br></br>  Chiyo is horrible plot device doll.  <br>But would a puffy Hana not be fine? Imagine being sat on with that.<br><br>By the way, I agree that the Medusa was her ability to turn Kiyoshi's dick to stone.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The only one to realistically have a full bush is the yaoi fangirl.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Keep your forced meme to shitty LN threads, tsunderefags.</br></br></br>  <br><br>There is nothing to agree or disagree about, Kiyoshi literally said it in the manga. She COULD BE sporting a bush independently of the metaphor, but circumstantial evidence points against it.</br></br>  <br> THK <br>wat?<br><br><br>Nigga, please. If that was the case she would wear spats or longer skirt. Hana has an ultra hairy manko, like it or not.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>hardcore shitposting</br>  <br>I really hope that it turns out that she planned everything from the start, down to encouraging her father to make the school co-ed.</br>  <br> I got caught in my shitposts <br><br>Theres was an oreimo thread up for you.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Hana has an ultra hairy manko, like it or not. <br> Hana sits on you while wearing her pants and you feel her puffiness. <br>I dont see the problem with this.<br><br>Then again, if she were shaved it might feel better, and less kimochi-warui to some.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Theres was <br>THK believers, everyone.</br></br>  <br>There was absolutely zero fucking reason she needed to send chairman and mari those pictures. The bitch is a spy.</br>  <br> Hana has an ultra hairy manko <br>Public hair don't grows from behind, cherry boy</br></br>  <br>I don't see the problem either. I don't mind Hana having a junglek in there as it only score her points with Kiyoshi.</br>  <br>Good thing we're talking about pubic hair then.</br>  <br>They are family members.</br>  <br>Thats even worse when theres an illicit relationship rule. Sending it to two people that are there to enforce that rule is the dumbest shit you can even do.</br>  <br> not bragging about getting a boyfriend to your family </br>  <br><br>USC rules are not the school rules. The boys were punished for attempting peeping, not because they went against UCS policy concerning boys.</br></br>  <br><br>Also, Kiyoshi was punished because he escaped confinement, not because he went on a date, same with Shingo not returning on time.</br></br>  <br>That's not the point. Who knows how thick her bush is, point is that you are projecting. It's not relevant.</br>  <br> overcensorship for BD purpose. <br> shit quality adaptation popular manga from shit studio for free money <br> ching chong animation <br> zero direction <br> airbrushed shadows <br>I hope for shit BD sales. Scum deserved it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't they just call "Gakuto" Gary and "Kyoshi" Kevin?</br>  <br>They are part of the rules otherwise is there an entire council devoted to enforcing the rule?</br>  <br><br>There is no rule against dating. There is a political agenda that UCS is trying to enforce, and you can be punished for going against it by being ostracized and such, but legally there is nothing they can do about it. <br><br>What part of UNDERGROUND Student Council don't you understand? They are not an official governing body, but more like a school club, admittedly one with a lot of pull.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Because that would have at least been somewhat funny, but we can't have any of that. What matters is that the translator has his way.</br></br>  watching this show with my mom was a mistake  <br>Well you were a mistake so it evens out.</br>  <br>nope I was planned, I know because she had a miscarriage after I was born and then my sister.<br>Also she and my dad were together for 10 years before they got married and had me.<br><br>That's okay though, I know you didn't mean it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Considering Mari is apart of it &amp; got the better room it's safe to say that the USC hold the real power. It's part of the reason why Kate wants them out.</br>  <br>Why is Kiyoshi begging so hard to be abused in that cover?</br>  Localized names:<br>Kiyoshi - Keane<br>Gakuto - Garrison<br>Joe - the same<br>Shingo - Sherwin<br>Andre - the same<br><br>Mari - Mary<br>Meiko - Melinda<br>Hana - Hannah<br>Chiyo - Cheyenne<br><br>Kate - the same<br>Risa - Lisa<br>Mitsuko - Michaela</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aw, how sweet.</br>  <br>the USC holds quite a large share of power in the school, mostly because Mari is the daughter of the chairman and he let's her push him around</br>  <br> What are social networks <br>Nobody knows anybody's birthday nowadays</br></br>  <br>yeah, now you have to tell me about your parents and how you were conceived.<br>It's the rules.</br></br>  <br>Kate is pure. Now do you Underground Student Council sympathizers see?<br><br>Base woman is best Kangoku Gakuen.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>For sure, but they can't do things like make a rule stating that "girls can't talk to boys", and then proceed to legally enforce them. <br><br>They work from the shadows, influencing everything that goes on in the school, but they can't outright make up laws, or break them indiscriminately. <br><br>If they could just do whatever, they wouldn't give a shit if boys had evidence of entrapment, nor could they be sent to prison themselves.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Keito's rule is a mistake.</br>  <br> tfw watching this show with my 15 year old cousin <br> tfw she said she liked it </br></br>  <br>But but...  I like Kate. <br><br>Who and where did the rumors that the USC prez was a slut originate from?<br><br>I can only remember the earliest 10 or 20 chapters where students were gossiping on how the USC were keeping the boys all to themselves via the prison complex, and that no other girl was actually offended with the boys "accidentally" peeping on them in the showers/baths.<br><br>What do you anons think?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Who has a better body? Him or Kiyoshi?</br>  <br>Kiyoshi.<br>Gakuto's hips are too wide.</br></br>  <br>We need a (male) wet-t-shirt contest to determine that.</br>  <br>Andre.</br>  <br> Who and where did the rumors that the USC prez was a slut originate from? <br>Kate.<br>She's a base woman through and through.</br></br></br>  <br>Did you asked her what scenes she liked?</br>  <br>We've already seen them in their underwear, that's way more than what we would see in a wet tshirt contest</br>  Which girl will you ouroboros with /a/?  <br>Yeah, but wet-t-shirt is sexier.</br>  <br>If I was a girl in an ecchi show I'd be kinda mad. Can't walk two steps without some fag trying to trip and grope you or look up your skirt. I can sympathize with tsunderes now.</br>  <br> Not <br> Kiyoshi - Kevin <br> Gakuto - Gary <br> Shingo - Steve <br> Chiyo - Chelsey </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok I'm not disagreeing with your post but you gotta admit that Kiyoshi has been pulled through worse shit than that and he's not a girl</br>  <br>No! I refuse to accept that. Well, actually I can understand but I still like Kate the best, because she did nothing wrong.<br>Kate a best Kangoku Gakuen. A BEST!!<br><br>The USC tarnished their own image and the ASC took advantage of their downfall, like any rational group would.<br><br>Also, Kate wouldn't talk or associate herself with bullies, particularly if they are her upperclassmen too.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know what to do now.</br>  <br>I hate Kate, but I love Kate.</br>  <br> because she did nothing wrong. <br> Kate wouldn't talk or associate herself with bullies <br>Are you delusional? That's her entire M.O.<br> bullied the Meiko <br> bullied the Meiko AGAIN until she lost her resolve <br> intentionally tries to destroy friendships   Mari is also a shit for doing this <br> only member of the regular Student Council who doesn't see the boys as anything other than stupid pawns <br> fights dirty <br> broke into someone's cell phone <br>Kate did everything wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shut up, Nui.</br>  <br>all of the boys have been treated worst than the girls</br>  <br>And they're still treated like shit. They have to do their races in a fucking parking lot.</br>  <br>Andre asked for it.</br>  <br>But all of those were less severe versions of what the USC did to the boys.<br>With the exception of the fire.<br><br>Mitsuko and Risa are also way more tolerant of boys than how Meiko and Hana treated them. Hana was way too easy to get violent (I mean in an actual offense taken state) on the boys, and Meiko was just strict because of loyalty to Mari.<br><br>Risa had a sword, but she never used it to severely beat the boys or girls like Meiko would with her whip.<br>Mitsuko only uses words.<br>Most of the pressure from the ASC members, comes from enforcement of the rules, not personal motives, like needing to watch someone pee.<br><br>Kate's reign is the best, and the most fun. Flexible, and lenient if need be, but strict when necessary.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>previews say that'll be this friday</br>  <br> Flexible <br><br>That's another word for corrupt.</br></br></br>  <br> Second volume releases November 17th <br> 4 months between every volume release <br> currently 17 tankoubons released <br>Jesus christ, hopefully it really won't take 5 fucking years to catch up to the Japanese release.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not as corrupt as Mari. Remember the gate and Shingo?<br><br> HE WAS IN SCHOOL GROUNDS ALREADY. <br>But to the USC prez, who was smug throughout, he broke the rules. They never bothered to open the gate for him to give him a chance, but rather counted down on his demise.<br><br>Kate would have allowed him in, but she'll cause something else to bear down on the boys as punishment, to cause confusion, rather than just destroy the boys willpower right there and then, like Mari would.<br><br>Kate is pure, and less corrupt. When she got Chiyo to be sent to prison, she also freed Meiko from her imperilment. Chiyo's imprisonment was also in accordance to the school rules, and Kate did not scheme against Chiyo for speaking to the chairman, but rather discussed the situation with regards to her position as Student Council president.<br>Not to mention, Kate freed Hana ASAP, as she did not see an opposition member as a threat, like Mari would otherwise. Kate is kind.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know, it'll be seriously disappointed if the school doesn't end under gakuto's rule. I'm hoping for him to go full keikaku at the end.</br>  <br>How is kate corrupt? I see this meme being posted a lot lately, it's obviously shitposting, but I want as entertainment an attempt to justify it. Not why kate is a bitch or a stalker, sure, she is, I accept that. But why is she "corrupt?"</br>  <br> implying I implied that Mari and the USC are any better <br> implying that not being as bad as the USC justifies anything <br>Kate is far and away the worst part of the ASC. I mean it's good and all for the plot, but just think of how much better things would be if they didn't have yet another vengeful, psychopathic bitch in charge. <br> Most of the pressure from the ASC members, comes from enforcement of the rules, not personal motives <br>Kate's entire motivation as a character is tearing down Mari. That's literally the only reason she does anything in the story. If the USC hadn't been run by her hated foe, she would've never complained to the Chairman and gotten them locked up and you know it. She broke Meiko to undo the good that Mari had done to her, she drew away Hana to leave Mari all alone, and then she showed Hana the Ouroboros picture so that she'd hate Mari even more.<br>The woman is fucking obsessed.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> obviously shitposting, but I want as entertainment an attempt <br><br>I won't waste my time.</br></br></br>  <br>Kate is obviously lacking some screws in her head, but on the whole she caused less suffering than mari, ergo she's better.</br>  Drawfag Thread 1545<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1539:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn (embed)<br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1544 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Requesting Terunori Kuga from Shokugeki no Soma doing Kamen Rider Kuuga's pose while wearing the whole suit, minus the helmet.<br><br>A kitchen knife or a sauce ladle in his left hand is fine too.<br><br>Please and thank you.</br></br></br></br>  requesting tamamo lying in bed pov similar to this<br>Maybe with a fang showing</br>  Requesting anon walking in on his embarrassed waifu masturbating to a picture of him while dripping/leaking thick, sticky pussy juice.

But she'll just end up as a topic for shit-posting and will be black listed in-so-much that just mentioning her will cause an uproar.<br>Everytime I see marikafag post, there's "Horse fucker" stuff, and "greedy faggot" stuff for Kobolifag. I wouldn't be able to deal with it if that happened to me and my waifu.</br></br>  <br>Well, then, start off with simple requests. Her drinking tea, or looking out at the sunset on the beach, or wearing so and so clothes or some shit.<br>Then maybe after two weeks or three, you can move up and start to request other things.</br></br>  <br>Just don't request waifus in the general then. Pick a pair of characters that are in the relationship, and request them.</br>  <br>Ignore other fuckers. If she's your waifu, then she's your waifu. Others can try to judge you, but only you can say what she means to you.</br>  <br>I've been requesting for months. That's how i know it won't stop them.<br><br>I don't just want this because I want fap material. Ideally, it would be an erotic image of my waifu.<br><br>Thanks you. And I agree, but it'd still suck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No way your waifu would lay a finger on my waifu, she'd be on the floor in a blink of an eye.</br>  <br>Then have the balls to request your waifu, instead of asking for a random one.<br> Requesting waifu masturbating. <br> Who is your waifu? <br> Not telling, since it would make me look bad, but a random other person getting a picture of his waifu masturbating, posted in this thread for everyone to see, is completely fine! Even if he wouldn't want one! <br>Put some fucking thought into this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wasn't thinking. Please forgive me. I'll stop now.</br>  <br>If you truly cared about any of this then you would commission lewds of her so no one else can see.<br><br>And you're Tsuyufag, aren't you?</br></br></br>  so whenever i browse WWD for requests to draw<br>there bound to be someone who just say "nobody's gona draw her" or somthin similar<br>so then i ask who's your waifu and they just didn't reply<br><br>what is wrong with you guys?<br>you want your waifu drawn then fucking say it out loud ffs</br></br></br></br></br>   boa was drawing waifus  <br> didn't get to request mine <br><br>goddamn it.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it's that people are willing to wait patiently to have her drawn, but will bemoan the chance that it might not happen before the end of Sunday.<br>That's how I see it. They're too proud to beg desperately for it, and are more than willing to request and wait.</br></br>  <br>I now have a relaxing weekend because of it<br> I'll be frantically following WonFes anyway </br></br>  <br> 2shy2beg <br>hmmm guess i didn't think about it this way<br>thanks anon</br></br></br>  <br>Asking directly makes you look desperate for drawings. Some people would rather wait for a drawfag to pick up the request. Some jump on every occasion for a drawing/collage, and in a long run make themselves look like a greedy scum.</br>  <br>No.  I'm Nononfag. </br>  <br>People are going to complain that their waifu isn't going to be drawn, but it's part of board culture not to vulture artists, even if you directly ask them.</br>  <br>See? That wasn't so hard. If you want lewds, the only way to do it while still looking like a true waifufag is to commission.</br>  <br>But there's like three dudes in there.</br>  <br>Even better!</br>  <br>What do you want them to do? Finger their assholes? I doubt their husbandofags want them jerking it.</br>  <br>Huh, thanks for using my drawing for the OP image, didn't notice till now.</br>  Requesting this concept art of cyborg Hakodate Omiko doing something cool. Maybe something One-Punch Man related?  <br> They're too proud to beg desperately for it <br>I think it's more that they don't want to be seen as greedy or vulturing or whatever</br></br>  Requesting barefoot ryouna  <br>Thanks for drawing Rukia, Boa-sama. Even though my reply is really late.</br>  <br>not eating a cactus?</br>  <br>barefoot ryouna eating a cactus using her feet</br>  <br><br>Collages are fine. Everyone even settled with the "rerequesting after a collage" Thing.<br><br>Also, its not vulturing if drawfag specifically asks for waifus to draw.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I know this feeling, anon. I've had my waifu for many years now, there's no way I could say I don't fap to her.<br>But requesting lewds in here? that's something I'm hesitant about.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno, I wouldn't rerequest after getting a collage delivery.<br>Unless someone was saying they'd take requests for a different collage, because that would likely take a few weekends to get delivered.</br></br>  Requesting BurningGreymon.  <br>Requesting a barbed noose around your neck.</br>  <br> "greedy faggot" stuff for Kobolifag. <br>I don't really see that happen outside of shitposters whining in the general. Horse stuff for Marikafag, sure, but nothing for Koborifag.</br></br>  Requesting Sawyer by a table, with a cup of coffee/chocolate, a sandwich, and reading a magazine.  <br>koborifag is just trying to shitpost himself, don't mind it</br>  <br>Okay, now I've seen this. I'm not even sure that this even happens most of the time.</br>  <br>Does koborifag even love kobori? I mean, does he even know of her character song?</br>  <br>You could say the same for a lot of other waifufags.</br>  <br>I'm glad some waifufags actually know shit about their waifu and not just imagine every single thing about them like they're fucking OCs.</br>  <br>I wonder if any of the other Bleachfags know about the concept covers? I'm a bit envious of them, since they get to hear their waifus sing.</br>  <br> tfw your waifu is so fucking good at singing <br>Feels good man.</br></br>  Take it to /ghost/. This is not a waifu thread.  <br>Can confirm. Listening to your waifu sing is the one of the best feelings in the world.</br>  Requesting Tomoko riding a dinosaur.  <br>Does Yuunafag even love Yuuna? I mean, does he even know that she's a lesbian?</br>  Requesting Kanna and Yuu in cute frilly swimsuits kissing underwater like the scene from Sakura Trick  <br><br><br>Can't beat this https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ICw<wbr>3HU0K5Ww</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Requesting Tomoko being RIDDEN by a dinosaur   sexually </br>    Requesting Akaza Akari drinking water to stay hydrated during this hot summer.  <br>First they came for Oorafag, and I did not speak out—<br>Because I was not a meme.<br>Then they came for Marikafag, and I did not speak out—<br>Because I was not a lewdfag.<br>Then they came for Koborifag, and I did not speak out—<br>Because I was not greedy.<br><br>Then they came for me —and there was no one left to speak for me.<br><br>Moral of this story is when you see someone getting shitposted, instead of being glad it's not you, you should tell the shitposters to get fucked. You can take back the thread from the three or four asshurt terrorist babies who do this if you just try.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or you could just refrain from being a spergy faggot altogether.</br>  <br>Depends on the rules for the fight.</br>  <br> Then they came for Marikafag,  <br>I wish.</br></br>  <br>Or just you know, don't be a faggot and no one will shitpost you.</br>  <br>If you don't say anything wrong no one will shitpost about you.<br>In the end, its all about how you act around people.</br></br>  <br>I might do another one of this later that isn't a sketch.</br>  Requesting a two-panel comic with carol (giant hat) saying<br> My dad is fucking dead! <br>and Hibiki responding with<br> At least your dad loves you! </br></br></br>  <br>Sweet Burninggreymon</br>  <br>But I always reply with my waifu every time.</br>  Requesting Adlet licking Fremy’s navel.  <br><br>Yeah no. Everyone who does anything besides request and never post again gets shitposted. Drawfags, people who socialize in the threads, people who thank excessively, fucking everyone who anyone can actually identify gets sperged on constantly.<br><br>Needs to stop.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe if you want to identify yourself to other people so badly you shouldn't be on an anonymous imageboard.</br>  Requesting this with Natsuru<br>thighhighs_pull<br>underwear<br>nipples</br></br></br>  <br>I don't care whether people know me or not, but I'm not going to cower in fear of a bunch of crying faggots who love being anonymous because they can shitpost all day and all night without consequence. <br><br>If I want to talk to someone to tell them they did a good job or that I missed them or that they missed a delivery, and I want to let them know who's talking to them, I should be able to do that without being called an avatarfag or a tripfag or a spergy faggot for literally no other reason except people knowing who I am for one post.</br></br></br>  Requesting Nadeko playing jenga but cheating with her snake hair  <br>It almost sounds like you give a fuck what other people say. So what if you tripfag and people have a problem with it? There is a little something called ignoring it. If you cant handle a little internet bullying for doing something you want to do then you shouldn't be on 4chan</br>  <br>And I don't care if you want to do all that somewhere else. The only time you should be identifying yourself in these threads are when you are either requesting or thanking. Again, if being recognized by people is so important to you, perhaps you shouldn't be on 4chan.</br>  <br>Oora! is not a waifu, it is a meme.</br>  <br>That's great, but Oora isn't my waifu.</br>  <br>RIP mishafag.</br>  <br>You still aren't even close.</br>  <br>You can request, fuck off, and be one of the most invisible people in the thread. However, that's not stopping drawfag from shitposting you through drawings. You can't win in these threads.</br>  <br>Working on it</br>  <br>Who is your waifu?</br>  <br>Mimi</br>  <br>moar like meme am I right</br>  <br>yeah so <br><br>The people who aren't shitposting retards<br>Or shitposting retard drawfags<br>Who actually love their waifus<br>And wouldn't want to be shitposted if someone found out who their waifu was<br><br>Need to gangrape the people who shitpost when it happens<br><br>Tamafag did nothing wrong except color waifus and be friendly<br>Yuunafag did nothing wrong except do pixels and be friendly<br>Koborifag did nothing wrong except writefag and be friendly<br><br>And they get shit on nonstop while these retards who shitpost them hide and shitpost and then pretend to thank the drawfags who draw for them while secretly hating them<br><br>All it would take is people telling them to get fucked when it happens.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ok</br>  <br>Just drop it.</br>  <br> Wake up <br> see this  <br>That's looking delicious! Thanks for picking it up!</br></br></br>  <br>You think that drawfag threads are an exception or something? That happens in every thread on pretty much every board. If you can do something that someone else can not they will most likely shit post you for being better than they are. What you really need to do it grow up and learn to ignore things you do not like, instead of having this big cry about your waifu not getting drawn by anon because he gives too much of a fuck about what other people think.</br>  <br>If you actually cared about those people, stop attracting attention to them.</br>  Also good morning!

Anyways, how's the Ryouna request going? </br>  <br><br> Maximum Overlewd </br></br>  Goddamn, I've been drawing hairstyles for over 3 months now and i'm still having trouble with this shit. This was something I drew a few minutes ago. I don't get what I'm doing wrong. These particular examples I did here, I tried to do more "anime" bangs, using my anime figs as reference, but for the past couple of months it's all been off 3D examples.<br><br>Every tutorial I've read doesn't tell me how to divide up the section with the bangs and the back of the hair, or how the hair should flow or how I should draw my lines. At this point, I thought I got it but now I'm just damn confused. <br><br>I don't wanna ask /ic/ either because they can be a bunch of biggoted assholes who tell me to stop drawing Chinese cartoons just because they hate it.<br><br>I'm just ridiculously discouraged right now and considering quitting hair tomorrow temporarily and moving onto eyes.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting color<br>http://i.imgur.com/kUnhDdt.jpg</br>  <br>those look fine to me. but then again, its not like im a animu hair drawing expert either</br>  <br>really nice! dem bullets and posing are really well-done.<br><br><br>l-lewd!<br><br><br>e-eh, i hope this helps, i think it would help if you partition the hair into strands of approximately same width. hair also tend to curve inwards to face the cheeks, anime figs don't help much but looking at how other illustrators draw helps a lot in learning how to draw animu imo.<br><br>artists like nardack and kurehito draw the hair very nicely and maybe you can take some reference from them:<br>https://chan.sankakucomplex.com/pos<wbr>t/show/4687727<br>https://chan.sankakucomplex.com/pos<wbr>t/show/4691729</wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I bet you can't even name all those waifus.</br>  <br><br><br>I feel like I've seen these exact two posts before, a month or two ago</br></br></br>  <br>you need to think in volumes, try to feel the 3d form and let the lines flow along with it. Go from big and blocky to small and detailed.</br>  <br>i just drew it and composed that post about 10 minutes ago though, yeah, the guy's asking for help is prolly the same from few months back<br><br><br><br>he explained it better, actually and this one's the proper way to draw hair</br></br></br></br></br>  Feeling like taking Bakemonogatari, or Desu Note requests  <br> you will never have something this awesome draw for you </br>  <br>I have, several times.</br>  <br>Requesting Black Hanekawa in a revealing China dress</br>  <br>Untitled-san is my waifu.</br>    <br>well fuck you</br>  Requesting Nakiri Erina in Prinz Eugen clothes and Prinz Eugen in Erina's clothes, please  <br>aight will do</br>  I would love a mecha-girl dog-girl of a BuCue from Gundam please  <br>Be sure to have side slits to show off those juicy thighs</br>  Requesting some cirno, either playing a guitar or using a camera  <br><br><br>Yeah it's me. Here's a picture of my progress. I believe I have made progress, but recently I've been sorta plateau-ing, which is something I definately do not want. I feel like I get the hair at some points but sometimes I don't. It's sorta weird. Would you guys say I'm on the right path? Would it be good for me to take a break from hair for now and try drawing other stuff?</br></br></br>  <br>She looks damn like fate stay nights rider</br>  <br>Well yeah, that's kinda like the point of those dresses no? haha</br>  <br>This reminds me of something but I can't put a finger in it.</br>  <br>If you feel stuck then try switching it up a bit. Maybe try drawing traditionally rather than digital for a while, I sometimes find that can help.</br>  Requesting Index twerking for Stiyl.  Kanase from Strike the Blood getting creampied and impregnated (with x-ray).<br>It'd be all happy and vanilla with hand-holing, teary eyes, and smiling.<br>Also requesting her dressed as an angel, how one typically looks or the MGE version.</br></br>  <br>I think you've improved considerably.

Total Maledom, or having Hori being his pet bitch in pet-play  <br> twerking <br>Nigger confirmed.</br></br>  Did the artist drop this pic of the two girls in Owari no Seraph wearing skimpy versions of their uniforms?  <br>I think your problem is that the hair you draw it's trying to emulate "real" hair, and anime hair normally works like chunks of hair put together, for example i draw this hair based on the 3D girl pic of your image.<br>I think you have to imagine how would that hair look in anime instead of trying to draw "real hair anime", or something like that, hope you can understand what I'm saying because I'm shit at explaining stuff.</br></br>  MILF Tiffania saying "Ara ara!

These regions were even allowed to apply their own law to their own people (but the few Romans who did settle there fell under Roman law) and they didn't get Roman citizenship until the 3rd century.

I don't care for Rin's design or Nico as a whole, and I'll probably skip Hanayo as well. <br><br>Eli is a must for me since she's top 3 and that is a good outfit. Honk could turn out well, Kotori looks great, Nozomi has a lot of potential. I'm a little wary of Umi and Maki but we'll have to see. If they turn out good I need them.</br></br></br>    <br>Then why are you in this thread, faggot? Go back to </br>  please excuse the shitty camera, the galaxy S5 is pure shit.

I thought they had the two worst outfits. Different strokes I guess. <br>If I had to put them in a most anticipated order based solely on what the figure would look like and not "best girl" it'd be;<br>Nico &gt; Umi &gt; Maki &gt; Hanayo &gt; Kotori &gt; Nozomi &gt; Rin &gt; Eli &gt; Honoka.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Yo dawg, I heard you like Fubuki so I put yo Fubuki on Fubuki so you can Fubuki your Fubuki while you Fubuki your Fubuki, Dawg   <br> series sells well  <br> anime is doing fantastic  <br>Alter or MF better fucking deliver,at the very least GSC.</br></br></br>  <br>Is that a japanese Daft?</br>  <br> live by the client <br>What kind of high class prostitute are you?</br></br>  <br>She's also dead sadly.
