[ Be honest /a/, who is the ONE DxD that is universally liked?<br><br>We know Rias, Akeno, Asia and Koneko all have their fair share of haters so they're ruled out, but what about the rest?<br><br>No one hates Xenovia or Serafall, right?</br></br></br></br>  Who in their right mind could hate Rias?  <br>Akenobros and Riasfriends are kind of like a "one or the other" group</br>  <br>way to start a dxd thread with another image of akeno so shocking<br>better call up her baby daddies they waitin for her in prison</br></br>  <br>Settle down it was the first image in my DxD folder</br>  <br> universally liked? <br>No such thing. Everyone has their own preferences. A lot of people don't voice their dislike of certain preferences. For me, I like a handful of DxD girls.

They're best bros, and so are the fans. There's just a lot of trolls trying to stir shit up.</br>   Koneko sitting on Issei's lap in color   <br><br><br>Nah, I keep up with the LN and the anime. Some people prefer different methods of DxD and that's okay.<br><br>Elitist LN fags ruin these threads. It's better to educate the anime only fags rather than be a fucking prick to them.<br><br>Akenofag shit posting doesn't ruin threads.

It's teaching tricks for quicker mental math.<br><br>But I don't know what they were thinking when they wrote the 17 - 4 step as "17 = 4 + 13" instead of "17 - 4 = 13".

From time to time I open my calculus textbook and remember what a ride that was.<br><br>It is borderline esoteric, magical, really.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No it doesn't, because this is an ambiguous equation. By PEMDAS you compute the parenthesis first, giving you 20 / 5 (4)<br><br>The ambiguous part is that 20 / 5 is not known. It's either 20 / (5 * 4) or (20 / 5) * 4. This is actually a very important exercise that a lot of autistic anons fail because they don't understand the importance of parenthesis in making a non-ambiguous question.<br><br>https://math.berkeley.edu/~gbergman<wbr>/misc/numbers/ord_ops.html</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>   Not being a university dropout whose mind has been rotting on nothing but chinese cartoons for over a decade   <br>Are you researching?

That's right, I'm gonna fuck you in the most creative way possible so that aliens have to come to earth and confirm that this fucking happened, they will come to realize that the evolution of mankind seeded by those who dominate the cosmos has already come to fruition. Indeed, through this fucking, we will seat ourselves atop the throne of existence, we will reach the pinaccle and it'll all be thanks to your asshole being penetrated in the most unimaginable way possible by my penis. Most likely, we will end the universe, but that's all fine, as long as I fuck you and you know it's ME that's fucking you.

The thigh is about 20% longer than the lower leg.<br>Her right foot is incredibly small and is at a weird angle.<br>Her thighs don't feel connected to her torso either, if her thighs are in that position, the upper body should be compensating to maintain balance.

I apologize for any chicken scratching.<br><br>Head and chest are okay; arm is a bit long and hands are a bit awkward; lower body is pretty odd. The hand on the leg seems pretty awkward. For the other hand, keep in mind that the hand opens and closes in a spiral, so you can usually trace an arc across the fingers' position. This can be employed to make any hand pose much more convincing.<br><br>The lower torso seems like it's just coming forward and like the legs are way too far apart. The legs also have some weird rhythm going on that I don't really follow.<br><br>The pelvis's orientation should not follow the chest's orientation unless she happens to be sitting, squatting, or lying down. In this case, the bottom face of the pelvis volume should be tilted away from the viewer relative to the chest volume. Note that the curve of the spine affects the orientation of the volumes that are attached to it (mainly the rib cage and pelvis).<br><br>The legs look weird as hell; I think the shins are far too short. In profile they're up against the skin, so the right leg's outer contour should be pretty straight as well. Legs should have a more downward orientation.<br><br>Take it as yo will; they're just another beginner's observation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the brush tool<br><br>If you're using the line tool you're probably doing it wrong</br></br></br>  Shima-tan as master asia<br>Nyaa-tan as domon</br>  <br>Is this Boa being a senpai to Smurf?

I think this episode really showed how much she's changed thanks to Akari and the girls, and putting the two of them back together for once was nice.</br>  <br>Who?</br>  Will Akari ever be Starlight Queen?  <br>The best</br>  <br>Not if she becomes Ichigo</br>  <br>That would require her to stop being rubbish.</br>  <br>I'd like to see you do anything she can.</br>  <br>I can fail and cry a lot just as well as she can.</br>  <br>I can cry like a bitch just fine anon.</br>  <br>I don't think I can be 2D, anon.</br>  That harness looks quite tight on her crotch.  <br><br>O-Oh yeah? Well too bad you're not cute about it!</br></br>  <br>Oh. That's true.</br>      <br><br>2nd Catchiest song since Signalize but the latter still takes the cake. <br><br> To the left to the left do you know do you know! <br> Mukau basho wa mirai no <br><br>This Aki Hata chick is on to something. She's practically singlehandedly masterminded Lantis emergence as the undisputed king of 2D Idol Pop.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Hime cut <br> Gothic Lolita clothing <br> Pale skin tone <br> Elegant personality <br> Diminutive <br> Vibrant purple hair color <br><br>It's not surprise she seems to have emerged as the most popular franchise character in a while, she's pretty much a checklist of ideal Japanese girl tropes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Emerging fetishes?</br></br>  Hice cut characters are best characters.  <br><br>Sunrises latest bundle of walking princess tropes.</br></br>  <br>m</br>  But why?  <br>Is is the CHOCOLATE part or the POTATO CHIP part you don't get?</br>  <br>They both confuse me equally.</br>  <br>I sweat a lot too, anon. A-Am I an idol too?</br>  <br><br>Sunrise/Bamco seems to have some sort of particular obsession with that hairstyle. They seem to manage to slip at least one into practically every show they do. Somebody should do a meme pic of it to go along with the laugh one and the Breaking Bad one since it's unquestionably a studio trope.</br></br>  <br>Why not? I'd like to try them.</br>  <br>That's not even a hime cut.</br>    <br>I think there's at least one character with a hime cut in every anime ever.</br>  Will Akari marry Sena-san?  <br>No, I will marry Sena-san.</br>  <br>Not if I marry him first.</br>  <br>I think he wants to marry Ichigo.</br>  <br>Sena is engaged to Madoka already. Didn't they tell you? It's a childhood friends thing, you see.</br>    <br>I really hope so.</br>  <br>Not if I marry you first.</br>  <br>Viva!</br>  I'm going to marry every last one of you.    <br/>    <br>Me three.</br>  <br>You know, they just made gay marriage legal in the United States, but I don't think they did the same for polygamy.</br>  <br>No, you're mine alone.</br>  <br>Rin used to be so fun, but then she got sucked up into Sumire's world of boringness.</br>  <br>うん</br>  <br> Will you treat me tenderly, anon? </br>  <br> Boring </br>  <br>I still REALLY hate Sumire's outfit.</br>  You have approximately 10 hours to name a loli from anime / manga who is more autistic than Rengu-chang from the anime / manga Non-Non Biyori.  Chiaki from MMK, her friends literally gave her ability a name, "Chiaki vision".<br>She filters what she sees in her life.<br>She excels in studying and shit in everything else.</br></br>  Yotsuba  <br>You</br>    Hakua from Shomin Sample.      Prisma Illya  <br>not autistic, just spiritual</br>  <br>you dummy, its not "sexiest loli" its "most autistic" read the thread. you darn dummy</br>  <br> "sexiest loli" <br>Yotsuba would still win.</br></br>  <br>Stop shitposting.</br>  <br> yotsuba <br>no, naru is sexier</br></br>  <br> children acting like children <br> autism <br><br>Do you even know what actual autism is or do you think it's a funny meme on 4chan?</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;children acting like children <br><br>I like how Rengefags think this is true.</br></br></br>  RENGE = CREATURE  id fug renchon's smelly fart hole.  <br> not "Ningyo nano dess" <br>You had one job, anon.</br></br>  <br>Most autism is just bullshit pandering to socially underdeveloped retards<br><br>Actual autism is a debilitating disease that leaves a person closer to somebody with downsyndrome than a socially awkward person.</br></br></br>  Who cares? Renge a best. Literally a perfect daughteru  <br>Renge's cunny is DYNAMITE</br>   Tfw the closest thing to a loli-centric anime KyoAni will make is lucky star <br> they jumbled up continuity so bad that theres no way in hell a season 2 could work <br> konata's VA slutting around ruined the chances of a season 2 even more </br></br>  What are the stat benefits of wearing blue shirts and yellow hats?  I like non non biyori because it has heart. <br><br>and is funky.</br></br>  <br>Wait... why 10 hours?</br>  <br>Stealth recommendation thread?</br>  <br>no  stealth loli thread <br> the other one is infested with shitposting. </br></br>  <br>Kobato chan</br>  That bland autist with the yard stick from Tamako Market  <br>Define<br>"actual autism"<br>It's a pretty large spectrum</br></br></br>  <br>i think hes reffering to non-funtional brain retardation aka full-retard</br>  Ryushika  Tooru and Yutaka were pretty autistic.  Miki from an upcoming anime.  <br>She's just chuuni.</br>    <br>+3 P.Def<br>+ Cold Resist<br><br>[+Randoseru]<br>+20 Equipment load<br>+7 Sexiness</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> +20 Equipment load <br>But wouldnt it also lower her speed?</br></br>  <br>Yes, lolis who wear that set have lower speed and agility, thus they are easier to catch.</br>  I'd say Arale is pretty autistic, but honestly shes a robot so i'd just say its bad programming.  <br><br>Is flute a weapon or an accessory item ?</br></br>  <br>Implement you can use to cast Bard spells.</br>  <br>Good question. Is the flute used mainly as a decoration or actually playing music and buffing your party members?</br>  <br>sounds funky.<br><br>I want to be a loli bard tank, with super high defense, so i can just buff party members while getting beat up.</br></br></br>  If you replaced "loli" with "child", I would suggest Akira from nagiasu.  Not even close.  <br>Valor bards can double as tanks, especially if you multiclass into fighter or Paladin.</br>  <br>Valor Bard? thats a thing? oh /tg/ you never cease to amaze. <br><br>What kind of stats does an old-style uniform like this carry?</br></br></br>  <br>It is in 4e, AKA the only edition where tanking doesn't involve actively pissing off the DM.</br>  <br>JESUS FUCK WHERE ARE HER HANDS?</br>  <br>god damn, what a fucking sexy.</br>  <br>Kobato is sex</br>  <br>All lolis in Hanamaru Youchien</br>  Well?  <br>Nobody else shall have you!

Your pleasure is mine.<br><br>Fuck off she's mine.</br></br></br>  <br>funky</br>  <br>You mean Yuki? And she's not autistic just schizo as fuck.</br>    <br>Your insides feel like heaven, loli. Mama would've been so proud  and jealous  of your tight loli cunny if she was still around.</br>  <br>w-what happened to mama?! D-DAD?!? WHERES MAMA-CHAN WHAT HAVE YOU DONE</br>  <br>I-I I thought we had already left this behind us, loli. Well I guess I can tell you again.<br>You see, Mama, she uh, she left us for our neighbor, Jamal.</br></br>    <br/>  <br>I think its kind of funny.</br>  <br>You are goddamn right</br>  this cat is living the dream.  <br>Oh loli don't cry. We have each other and that's all we need. I planned on bringing mama back but seeing how she looks like she could star in a ntr doujin, I'd rather not have that kind of woman around.</br>  ITT: Girls with nice thighs, ill start    Courtesy of the leg fetishists in Ark Performance.        378 days to go  <br>Ah, sorry I should have checked properly.<br><br>And thanks, will do.</br></br></br>  I am ready!
