[  threesome date starts with 8man and Yukino staring into each other's eyes again, later 8man ditches Yui to go talk to Yukino   Yui gives 8man her chocolates and Yukino didn't. 8man stops her from giving up on the 8bowl   friendship end flags raised by threesome date and 8man's refusal to show romantic feelings for anyone     8man flirts with Iroha after mixing saliva   So basically flags were raised for every single ending. To top it all off he ended the volume on a cliffhanger instead of wrapping things up like he usually does. Why does Watari do this to us? Does he want us to suffer? Is this how he makes money, through our tears?       I want to kill this fucking cunt.   This is it, the end of the road. Our days in these threads are numbered now, anons. Guess I'll be seeing the brothers on future Iroha threads.           Yukino will win just go home.  Reminder that Yuckyno YukinoSHITa is objectively the worst girl.  Write a letter to Watari RIGHT NOW    I feel that Yui would be up for the rough stuff but Yukino would enjoy mutual oral sex.    Seriously hope Vol.12 isn't the last. I feel like there's still a lot more to be said.  So everybody overreacted to spoilers?  How much until "Good Irohasu!" post appear?   This is especially true because Watari loves giving needlessly long winded descriptions of 8man sitting places doing nothing.    Best mail all your sheckles to WW ASAP then    WHEN IS VOLUME 12 COMING FAGGOT?I'LL BUY THE DAMN LN.   [x] SEND DICK PICS   Dear Watari,  Please don't miss your deadlines and end up having to write 11.5  Also Japan is ready for a 3P end. You know it's the only correct option.        Don't jinx it.    I'll miss you captain, I'm guessing you'll just be lurking in the future LN threads?   Good Irohasu!   You were literally asking for it. Seriously.         God I wished Takeo would just come out of nowhere and slap 8man for being so Beta  Currently waiting for the Yui mom doujins   I hope the opposite.   How many will survive the incoming Yahari drought to tell the tale?  So who loves 8man more?   Yui or Yukino?    So, Yukino is pretty much Cloud at the beginning of FFVII, minus the mind lags due to being experimented on, but has the same self-steem issues, and pretty much copies the behaviour the people she looks up to.   Cloud was much cooler when he tried acting like Zack, rather than emoing around though.       threesome with 8man, gahama-chan and gahamama.  Japan please.     Are you kidding? It would snap the poor boy's neck and send his head spinning off into a ditch.    That image was the funniest shit in the world the first time it was posted. Now it has lost all of it's meaning, just like the very series it insults.  Perhaps that was the goal all along.     If you could change one decision 8man made, what would you change? Would you walk Yui home? Would you go over to Yukino and take the chocolate yourself? Would you fuck saika?      Yui is love and Yui is life, so I'll be in here for the long haul.  At least until Spyro finishes translating the whole series.        double paizuri    they both call 8man Hikki   Don't fail me, nips        It's a fun ride taichou.  Our goddess back down so the Club can solve their own problem. Now Yui and Yukino start moving, she must try harder in vol 11.5 and 12. I'll lurking till then...     Just ordered my Yukino body pillow. Bought an onahole so i will stick it in it and fuck my pillow. You can call me what you want, but I wont call you nigga    the only other fanart i can find of yukino mom is her taking the dick from who I assume is 8man and talking about NTR    I'll be on those, yeah. I'll post but not with the intent of killing the cunt.    where did you get the pillow from?    Pics of pillow please.   So what now? endless waiting until vol.12 comes out?   Pics or fuck off    Love you too.   Well the blu-ray side stories should be coming in a relatively decent span of time, so it isn't as bad as a wait. But it's still going to suck because of that bloody cliff-hanger.    At least you're honest about it, some people pretend it's for two different things when we all know they are bloody lying.   Good to hear, hopefully the threads will be calmer since the airing is over. I've always enjoyed your presence in these threads captain.             11.5 will come 1st, typical Watari    Basically. If all goes well, November/December      Not him but I posted these pictures in a thread not too long ago.       8man and Yukino staring into each other's eyes again   Why 8man and Yukino go full spaghetti when they look at each other over the last 3 episodes?      I'll assume most of his hangups make a lot of early scenes non-decisions in a sense, and instead of waffling at Destinyland I'd make plans to take Yui to the neighboring amusement park the weekend after Christmas. All the riajuu would be burned out from doing their Christmas Eve deitos so We'd practically have the whole place to ourselves.    the other side (I presume)       Aliexpress motherfuckers       Sexual tension of course.   When do the subs usually go up?   I-is she fucking naked? That's lewd anon.    They want to fuck.   Seeing Yukino as she is now, is like seeing Stone Cold when he started acting like a faggot after Wrestlemania X7.  Will the old Yukino return?    Does this look like the face of mercy?   Yukino End is best.    no signs that Yukino loves 8man for 12 episodes   hurr durr now she loves him  Shit, just shit. Hikki is Yui's property.     Iroha or Death, Captain!   I'll miss you Captain and Yukinofags plus Yuifags, we've went through our Cold Wars but it sure as hell was one great Cold War.       That, and 8man is forcing himself to suppress his feelings because he wants to help Yukino achieve genuine before he admits his feelings.    4/5 months till Vol 12    OVA who knows when    Let the waiting begin      Yuckyno a shit.    Well, I don't know about you but I am fucking her naked too.     It is obvious he has feelings for her    Reminds me of another time she wore a look of unshakable determination.    That's not Yukino, that's Ayase.    Yes    "Don't you think hose penguins look like birds?"   "Penguins are birds"   For fuck's sake Yui.      With how Yukino acted this episode, the amount of ice layers walling in her fragile personality was insane back then.    Fuck off    Old Yukino is gone, along with the comedy.    I hope this happens   Fuck. It's too good.     I was waiting for this since vol. 1     Well, one could argue that she wasn't thinking about what she was saying. She was more focused on her goals at the time.    Why are you comparing a 17 year old highschool girl to a wrestler? I think this is the reason why I am going to miss these threads.    I laughed, it was freaking funny.   So Yui started getting down when she saw the penguins grooming. Why?  Yukino got down when she saw that penguins only have the on partner for life. Why?        This still hurts no matter what boat you're on.      Yukino is just going through a dere phase right now because she's in love with 8man and doesn't know what she's supposed to do and when she's supposed to do it.      Because they saw, the penguins can only have ONE partner.    why must she suffer so    What a fucking retard. I probably would've told her to kill herself.      Why does that make them sad then?    In LN it's a fair scene. Since Yui did it to Yukino 1st, right after Penguins scene    I'm not gay but 8man is fucking hot there   Because I'm sure most of you don't have nearly enough Gamama in your life yet.  https://d.maxfile.ro/gxvsdbmrwb.mp4<wbr></wbr>     That's not accurate at all. Succubus are effectively powerless against those who can resist lust.  Furthermore they don't enslave men, they drain their lifeforce, killing them.      Dumb slut like her mother and she would probably become a teen mom like Yuimom.      Yui   Her smile and optimism: Gone.        fireworks scene    the music   It's like seeing someone slowly die. Well done Feel.      Hold my creditcard anon. It looks like a Yukino pillow won't be enough. Look at her face. I am looking forward to mastubrate in that face and cum on it   She had her moments in the LN; it was probably 50/50 Yui/Yukino when paired with Hachiman    When is the fucking Yukino figurine coming?    Because seeing Yukino being as lame as she is right now, is as sad as seeing Austing being lame after Wrestlemania X7.   A girl can be dere and awesome at the same time. Yukino is a ball of problems right now. Yukino used to be cool back in the days. The dere isn't worth the loss of her attitude.         You're the one buying merchandise. Watari cares about your opinion the most.  Tell us anon, who do you want to win?     Why did this scene immediately cut to Yukino? Did he just leave Yui to take pictures alone?    I'm not sure what you're trying to tell me.    whats those runes say     He wanted to talk to Yukino about being partners for life.  No but really he thought she was troubled and wanted to help her.  Not sure why he didn't take Yui with him since they're all friends.       penguins only get one life partner. Both Yui and Yukino want the 8 for themselves     I pre-ordered both Yui scales. They can't come soon enough.     My anon can't be this dense. Anon, they realise that they can't share 8man. Just one person can have him. That's why they get serious again.    That's not official merchandise, so Watari doesn't care. I think I might though. Is it cheating on your waifu if you have two dakis of her? I'm new to the etiquette of this.  The  genuine  one was released way back around S1.      Unless one of them dies penguins only have ONE partner for the rest of their lives.  This made the girls both sad but I don't know why.      Indonesian  subs is out.  beware of his shitty translation though     That penguins have the same partner until they die. Or just that they have one partner.   Not being bias here, but honestly I feel like the anime really didn't do the Yui's scenes justice.   The anime completely skipped over all the 8man's monologues that indicates there may be a chance for Yui end, wait for vol.11translation and you will see what I mean.  Even many nips in 2ch feel the same way.  アニメだけ見るとゆきのんエンドが一番可能性が高い    原作読むとガハマさんエンドかなと思う   印象が全然変わってくる             Soon anon, we can only hope.    And the fun side.    they obviously  like penguins and are sad when one dies     He offered but she said she was going to take more pics.      mfw so accustomed to English sub that looking at indosub feel awkward    So what's Yukino's request going to be.   The whole adaptation has been like this though. It was pretty obvious that they would do the same with this vol.    Feel must know Yukino will win, that's why.   I like dere Yukinon. I think in short spurts its perfectly fine (see ramen walk back in ep 1)  What I dont like Watari doing is putting Yukinoshita into these extremes where she was icy cold at the beginning and now shes some hopeless dere that cant do much (hurt me to see how much she wanted to give those chocolates to Hikki but couldnt)  Enough is enough Watari. Yukinoshita is suffering. She had to deal with Yukimom and haruno (twice) in a span of a day or so. She's the main heroine. You dumpstered her since like vol 6. Where is the light at the end of the tunnel?       can 8man  get more tea cos they ran out     To save her    They fking cut it.!!! Wtf feel, you cut Iroha 2nd question, and Yui scene with 8man, while Yukino watch it.  Even when she tell 8man and Yukino go ahead, she will catch up later. Just because she know Yukino saw her and 8man sweet moment.     Yukino is lovely there   So both Yui and Yukino want to be 8man's something genuine? Why? Isn't that going to cause conflict.    8man please give me the 8  pretty much     Yeah Im a Yukifag but Yui had some pretty good moments in the LN that FEEL skipped.   I'd say they both have equal shots of winning      You should just make her independent women that needs no help. Seriously Yui and 8man helping her out the entire last episode and through the whole series. She needs to fix that dependency issue.     She's the main heroine   She hasn't been one since S2 started.       go to AilExpress   search "yuigahama"   first result is "Yui Yuigahama in: Pillow Cases"   God bless technology.        To be her new daddy   The guy behind this show must really hate secondaries.   not as such  that's just the nature of 13 episode LN commercials.       horizontal stripes   It's the greatest thing and the ultimate fetish.      Somehow this image makes me feel like she's finally happy. So damn peaceful   I like 8man's VA. He's got such a grizzled world weary voice for a teenager. I think he really nailed Hachiman.    13 episode LN commercials usually have a rushed ending but and ending nonetheless.  This was left open as fuck and doesn't feel like an ending at all.      26  lol, he's totsuka model     Why is 8man so hot    yukino loves hayama  what now faggots, she's dropping spaghettis all over around the 8inch     I like 8man's VA  Watari likes him even more     Please stop    and volume 11 ends on the exact same point. S2 isn't just "buy the LN" it's "buy the LN in SIX MONTHS"    "This isn't our last request... Hikigaya-kun, there is still your request."  She will follow his genuine request to the end.    I think he really nailed Hachiman.  Both figuratively and literally.       HOLY FLYING ASSCHEEKS MY DICK IS IN MY LCD   They do not have equal chance if one adaptation is focusing on the other.    commie delaying the subs again  Time to learn moon language.    *Watari licks him even more    Im Genuinefag, and LN is the only sauce.    Hiratsuka sensei made the first request.  She brought 8man into the club and asked Yukino to help him become a better person.      ntr fag you mad?    I meant in the LN they do and that's what ultimately counts. Though I still think Yukinoshita wins in the end     Or spanish.    It doesn't matter, the girls think genuine = their pussy. They are wrong.   Shot through the heart, blood streaming from my lips, manages to cry out "Brothersss!!!"   Totally forgot about that. You think Sensei will remember that too?    He has good range. For example, how he worked with Asemu in Gundam AGE.  Younger Asuno: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xq<wbr>6p84_gundam-age-asemu-asuno-vs-desi<wbr>l-galette_shortfilms  Older Asuno: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1<wbr>2uz36_gundam-age-memory-of-eden-ase<wbr>mu-asuno-vs-zeheart-galettet_shortf<wbr>ilms  Shame he doesn't get more roles. He seems like a good VA,  Also  dailymotion  I know. I couldn't find anything else, sorry.      </wbr></wbr></wbr>   </wbr></wbr>        225x225  why must you tease me     Hello there my brother of excellent taste.  for the last time until movie or ova or maybe season 3 .     Yes. And that will tip the contest in Yukino's favor allowing her to command anything she wishes of 8man.    She will, although I'll admit that I'm not as sure as I used to be.     "It doesn't matter if we're wrong, because I'll keep looking for the answer."     152 / 47 / 52    Just another Yahari thread     After the last 3 episodes I really think she will win.   I feel empty now. The LN translation is gonna take a few weeks. And this is my first post-anime depression after 4 years. FUCK      you've gone three threads without a reply, you must feel so lonely anon.  I'll even throw in some of Yui's yuis.      maybey get a second hobby?      I really hope Watari has a good reason for the extreme behavior shift. It's got to be one huge fucking trauma for her to be that helpless in episode 13. Or maybe Feel was exaggerating it, but either way, I have my eyes on you Watari.     Does Yukino actually say that? I don't remember that in any of the spoilers.     I hope she gets a good farewell.   Also, was this episode before or after Valentine's Day? Because Saki would almost definitely work up the courage to give 8man chocolate for at least helping her and being nice to her little sister.       That is true, but both mediums are not going to go separate routes. They timed volume 11 and end of season 2 to come out the same week. The animation people are definitely talking to the author to determine progression. It is highly unlikely that the anime is strongly pushing one female without cause.     Go watch School Days. It will heal you     How does that show help anyone    GODDAMN YUKINON KAWAII AS FUCK THIS EPISODE   There's still last episode of plastic memories tomorrow, then suicide.    I do wonder how much Watari has input into the anime  When FEEL announced an anime last year, did they envision animating Vol 10/11? I think it was announced when 9 came out, not entirely sure  I would have thought ending it at 9 (teacups) would of been great and we'd get s3 but I guess they wanted to animate everything        Now that's alpha.    I feel pretty sure FEEL knows how it will end.   Uhm, I searched for Yumiko pillows, but I just got this guy staring at me instead. Is this trying to say something? Is it wrong to fuck pillows? I am fucking pillows. You can call me what you want, but I wont call you nigga   What  onahole  did you buy anon?    I wouldn't say the anime "strongly pushed" any one heroine. Remember how we went from FEEL IS YUIFAGS to FEEL IS IROHAFAGS and finally FEEL IS YUKINOFAGS?  All the girls got their time in the spotlight       last request  So they really are going to disband the club after the contest is over?     Yes, she does.    Same anon  This is the only Anime I watched this season too.     penguins have the same partner till one of them dies   THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE    so confused     8man looking content or even happy lately  If he finally finds the genuine  and learns to love Yui , will his bad eyes heal?     she dont want yui leave. She want her stay there and watch how she give 8man the choco. NTRfags confirm    Guys how do i find the genuine     Best, best, best girl  I like that macro.     His eyes don't need to change.        Ctrl + F  Type "Genuine"      she always is    I know that feel.  Between saving the latest episode of Ore Monogatari for right after I finish Plastic Memories and my love for Yui, I think I might just live to see next week.      google windows activation      The look on Komachi's face kills me every time.   S3 when Volume 12 when  Subs when     Movie when Prequel novel when Yukino POV sidestory when      Yui's trigger face gets me everytime.    Shut up Watari Go fuck your kouhai         What would you cover in the prequel novel? Hachiman's middle school years? Or Haruno/Hayama/Yukino elementary school years?     Well, we've still got the most of actual Volume 11 to read as Spyro does his work, so that'll sustain us for a little while and then...fuck.  Have to see if any more of the VN routes have been translated I guess.       Yui End when?      Didn't post the rest     It would be very content with a movie ending if it turns out to be as good as Disappearance    Orimoto ofcourse     Volume 13 comes out   Grand finale   2ch goes bananas   /a/ is bombarded with Yahari threads for several days   Suddenly Watari announces something via twitter   "I'm marrying my kouhai after all this time"   Also, Iroha wins          Uwaa~      implying that watari like girl     Nyaa~    SoL of Yui/Yukino/8man during their middle school years. I would love too know more about Yui's past.    Why does she look like that?   Sorry Irohafags, but kouhai victory means Totsuka.     All the girls got their time in the spotlight  Indeed but in the end when it counts most they became Yukino-fags. The MAX COFFEE™ symbolizes this.     Got "Yahari a" too    ffu~ffu~ffuuu     S3 when  Never.   And even if there was it'll be two episodes with the way FEEL handle the adaptation.        You dont know that Max Coffee and Irohas are actually Coca-Cola brands?   Cat or dog?     Brothers!   I'll miss you bros. It was a good ride. Go, follow your dreams. I'll stay here. And if the time comes, I'll guide our ship to the depths of sea myself.         Never Months from now When Torn oppression ends       Yui looks fine   Yukino = derp.   Sasuge feel.        talking about an external object as metaphor for talking about one's own feelings  I swaer to fuckin christ every goddamn anime with drama in it     Penguin&gt;Cat&gt;Dog    I'm a Kamakura type not a Sable type.     That whole fucking acquarium dates was just them using fishes as metaphors.   It felt like the pacing for this season was all messed up.  Volumes 10 and 11 were done so fast. While all the student council drama and tension afterwards were glacially slow.     I'm not into suicidal dogs. Also, where the fuck was Sable during this episode     Cat for a pet, dog for a waifu.    Maybe her feelings for Hikki hurts.    None. I prefer not having to deal with their shit every day.    I'm a both person.    They watch me at night       spics subs are shit. For real.    Why do I feel so happy?   why they are alone in the acquarium? just the 8man, Yui and Yuki   Well, who the hell goes to an aquarium in winter? In the snow, of all things.    Autistic teens, of course.    Because Ohara Sayaka has the best mom voice in anime.    They were drawn there by the power of convenient plot location for dramatic conclusions   I work in 3 hours and i don't feel subs are coming anytime soon. Sad.  Do we have anonsubs these week? Or is he still gone?       Yo nigga, I don't even like Yui but that Yuimama is fucking smokin'    I think the animator want makes Yui as tragic as possible and cut anything that makes her chance for win really hopeless so Anime only viewer really FEEL sympathy about her situation. They do that to saving screentime to be able animate every important scene and still manage convey the feel from these scene. Not only that they do give justice to Yukino as main heroine in anime compared what Watari in LN.  Believe me. If they show 8man's real reaction and his monologue about Yui from LN in anime. It's hard to imagining how Yukino end unfold because Author pretty much shat on Yukino as damsel distress in recent novel when she still lacking romance progression at same time.      Real talk  Now that the girls are going to be genuine about their feelings who will this work out. They have to see each other in club all the time, how is it going to work without imploding and hurt feelings? How is 8man going to deal with the fact that real life girls are in love with him and are open about their affection? Does he "Eh!! Nandatte!?" out of there?      Yui-mom has pinkish-orange hair also   Confirmed not dyed.     So we are all in agreement that Yukino still likes Hayama?   Well, he could pick one, pick both or pick none. His (Or rather Watari's) choice.     8man is going to try to self-sacrifice again to keep both of them happy  tragic end       I feel that Yukino's request is going to kind of puts things on the backburner for a while. If they've got something really important to work on, the constant romantic tension will dissipate a bit. As long as it doesn't involve practice making chocolate.  Not that it won't still be there. It won't be ignored just not taking precedence. Eventually through all that things will narrow down to one of the girls.  Maybe, hopefully, who knows.         That doesn't make any of them happy.   SUBS WHEN   A longer expiration date really makes a difference.    They would smell through that one in an instant and it would make them both really sad.   This is the way I would imagine it if there was a volume 13.       no, but he'll find some stupid ass justification to try to do it. remember, he's still in denial that he could trust anyone or that anyone could find value in him. In several ways he's as fucked up as Yukino is  it'll probably be some stupid stunt where he tries to play matchmaker while pretending to be a huge asshole to the girls     Yui fags love suffering.   No, 8man should interpret them wanting romance as having romance with any other guy but him and try to fix them up with other guys.     Outside of the two or three delusionals, yeah.    Why does she look at him like that?    She just realized the grave mistake she's making, and that the only one she wants is Yui.     She realized that she's not genuine.   Iroha end is the only reasonable end, the other two don't deserve the 8man.   Did he say something after "Ore wa.."?      divorce 8 years later, horrible custody battle.   No thanks.       Which is why 8man should take Yui. She'd never betray him like Yukino.     Drama: The Anime      False-flagging isn't genuine.     Yeah, I bet she thought he might confess.    yukinofags win   NOW WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP IN YOUR MASTER PLAN     Yeah the Yui monologues in the LN are quite something but they've arent exactly new; theyre similar to what he thought in 10.5  Two ways to interpret it:   Yui's chances of winning are about as equal to Yukinon (likely)   It'll be that much harder for him to reject her if Yukino is end girl   Just my thoughts  Oregairu has basically morphed into Yukinoshita's story since Vol 6 so I am hoping that she gets a good end instead of being dumpstered again and again             Yukino win   8man will have to deal with her family   they live happy for a few months   they start fighting   1 or 2 years later they divorce    Yui win   they live happy for their entire lives   8man will bang a 10/10 woman everyday   will never be NTR'd   will have qt daughters              Celebrate and move on, just like any other series.     Implying that was a false flag/samefagging   You know it's the truth.      crashing this meme     Shot through the heart,   AND YOU'RE TO BLAME!  YOU GIVE LOVE, A BAD NAME!        CRASHING THIS SERIES   WITH NO RESOLUTION       You can see the gears in her brain going a mile a minute but unable to come to any sort of acceptable solution  I-I want to give Hikigaya-kun my choco!   But Yuigahama-san likes him too and it will probably hurt her feelings!   Oh gosh, but if I give it to him while we're alone it might come off as too clingy!   D-doushio?         CRASHING THIS THREAD   WITH NO SURVIVORS       I blame everyone being a drama queen in this series to the little presence of their fathers in their lives.      Not bathing in the tears of the defeated  It's like this is your first love triangle anime.    I really liked this show. Why did it have to turn into some sort of retarded Disney Channel high school drama?  Seriously, the current situation in the club is pretty much retarded normalfag drama. Hell, I've seen normalfag teens deal with this things better than these guys.  Shit, now I can see 8man being played by Shia LaBeouf.  Fuck this, and fuck you.            "I can't accept your request, Yukinoshita should solve her problem on her own."   "I don't need a relationship out of convenience or because it's easy."   I think it's stupid, even knowing it doesn't exist, even knowing if I say it I won't gain anything.   "Even so, think right, suffer, do what you can."    "I..."        yukino is a good character, well-written.   vol 12   unavoidable situation   8man's bright idea is to confess again to some girl   he goes through with it without consulting Yu/Yukino  What happens? If he tells them beforehand would they let him?         woman  So he'll be sleeping with Gahamama as well, you mean.       Yui win   Yukino so distraught, makes up with mom and goes overseas    Calls up 8man and cheats with him before she goes away   Yui takes 8man to airport to say goodbye   pic happens   Yukino leaves  sad end           least genuine girl is most deserving of the guy who wants something genuine  whatever lets you sleep at night buddy       I want it all.     Is it wrong to fuck pillows?   none of the characters are well-written, this series went to shit after ditching the comedy elements  insights on the human condition aren't a fucking indicator of how well-written a character is you fucking retard      What happened to you Yukino?   Fuck, if Hachiman ever rejects Yukinoshita, I'm not sure she'd survive at this rate given how fragile Watari has made her. Well maybe end of Vol 12 Yuki could handle it but not now      It's time to move on.    If Yui lost she'd still be their best friend, and probably a better marriage councilor than any professional they could hope to hire.  Don't try to fly the flag of the SS Gahama if you don't have room in your heart for her beloved Yukinon.      I dropped it after S2E3, too fucking melodramatic and little humor whatsoever.     I dunno how this actually helps the situation.     Does it :  A) take someone's life?   B) take someone's property?   C) take someone's liberty?  If your answer to A, B, and C are no then you're in the clear.        what a selfish bitch. thank god shes losing     Aski 8man after volume 12.     ORE WA   Subs?  Will Yukino give the chocolote in the end?  I just want Saki to find happiness, I don't care who wins. Saki "slice-of-life" spin-off when?  Let me see if I've got this straight   8man confesses to Ebina   Yukino hates his tactics, Yui is hurt because she loves him   The next storylines, both Iroha election and halfway into the Christmas story, 8man assumes his tactics are the main reason things aren't genuine   8man says he wants genuine and essentially promises to let them in on his plans and be friends again   They all think it's fixed   Haruno reminds them that it was just 8man's tactics that made them fall apart, it was to do with a love triangle too   Now they need to sort out their feelings to become truly genuine   Am I right?             no  HER SOUL IS MINE        When?      Assume that it would and he goes out an does it without telling them.      8man stops being a fucking dunce for a second and realizes what's happening between him and the girls   hiratsuka talks to 8man   repeats the line about suffering and hardship and worry being genuine   8man has a revelation   he   privately speaks to both Yui and Yukino and tells each of them that the other confessed to him, and that he accepted their confession, but they wanted to keep it a secret from each other to protect each other. he's only 'telling' them because he felt each girl deserved it   &gt;each time he tells one that he's doing something with the other, he just instead goes home   &gt;the 2 girls never realize what he did and they remain on good terms with each other   &gt;8man spends his time at home listening to an old tape deck on repeat, playing https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4zL<wbr>fCnGVeL4</wbr>  [ ]            soon   ?

O Y A K O D O N    This is good, couldn't find the source off google, any more?        What would be the girls' favorite sex toys?   Yukino   Riding crop. Simple, elegant, and effective. One lash every time 8man opens his mouth without her permission    Yui   Collar. Useful for exhibitionism and pet play, and symbolic of her dedication to 8man.    Iroha   Gimp mask. Keeps Zaimokuza's mouth shut and his face covered so she can fantasize about 8man.            This genuine thing is starting to get annoying.  I want to cuddle her.   Better question is what sex position for each of the girls     Only because the fanbase wields it as a clumsy club to declare who is the superior waifu.   Buzzword        Yukino - missionary Yui - doggy style Iroha - cowgirl  Saki - standing   Hiratsuka - public exhibitionism          Yukino  Missionary  Yui  Reverse Cowgirl  Iroha  Doggy  Saki  Spoon              Yukino  Missionary   Yui  Doggystyle   Iroha  Anything that involves anal.             Yukino  Missionary position with the purpose of procreation   Yui  Boob-grab doggystyle, is there any doubt?   Iroha  Cowgirl   Saki  Spooning because she's shy           It was annoying as fuck last episode with Haruno saying it     i like you. you can come over to my sister's apartment and fuck me      I will never spoon Saki     remember, no russian.    doggy style or bust for Yui, whatever lets 8man do most of the work for Yukino, and leglock missionary for Iroha    doggy style someone other than Yui  come on man you know better         Yukino  Missionary or Cowgirl  Yui  Doggy style  obviously   Iroha  69/reverse cowgirl          why live then?    8man should just confess to Haruno out of the blue and plant a kiss on her next time there is something happening between them and her. Just to see her reaction. I am sure the girls will understand.   http://pastebin.com/dJas1C5B    I you're typeset guy I finished the bodyswap comic.   What is 8man trying to show us, /a/?   Fuck off      Iroha NOT SPOONING   Yui NOT DOGGY STYLE   You fucked up so bad.   Yukino dead fish   Saki Missionary            Yui's self-immolation   I can't do it nigga  I don't want her to die I don't fucking want stupid cold tuna useless bitch first girl to win what she hasn't even tried to obtain while Yui has been trying since fucking dayone but I know Wataru will either have Yukino win or friendship end        90% of the fanbase on suicide watch   Perfect.      Watch the EP, Yui's ship is still up, 8man didn't let her burn it down.      Iroha    Spooning  She would like to see him cumming    Deadfish  Opinion discarded        vol 12 has not been written yet. You can still go find watari.    Yui did have her moment, right before Yukino had hers (and Yukino had to look from afar at Yui's moment, just like Yui did when Yukino had her time). FEEL just skipped it. Yukino wouldn't even have had her moment had Yui not given her and 8man some time alone.  I really hate these love triangles in which everyone is friends. Seriously, if love triangles are already bad, these are especially so as things hardly move forward.       I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED NIGGA BUT THAT WAS PAINFUL TO WATCH AND I KNOW SHE'LL STILL LOSE     "I..."  "I..." what?      I don't fucking want stupid cold tuna useless bitch first girl to win what she hasn't even tried to obtain  Fuck off. Yui would never love you. Yukinon is her best friend.    subarashii commie     Now.       Wait, if Yui likes 8man that means at some point she thought of his dick in her mouth, and that makes her a slut.     ITS GOING UNDER     Oh neat, someone with better than potato-tier shop abilities picked up my idea.      It's an Ohaiyo-class (also known as "Yahallo") sub, it's basically unsinkable.      It's not slutty as long as it's only one boy, her one true destined Hikki.  Yukino and Iroha have a LOT of explaining to do for the whole Hayama thing, though.      What a twist!  Aren't you blushing a little too much, Yukinoshita?   Not Haruno using logic to convince him that all there dates together were legit and should make it official.  8man says it can't be helped.  She walks him to a cafe with his arm clamped inbetween her tits to meet up with the others.  She says something to embarass him and he looks away. She pokes his cheek.   He turns back too quickly to notice how close her face was and accidentally plants a kiss on her cheek and freaks a little.  She calls him a cheeky boy and gives him a full on kiss on the lips in front of everybody.             I can't wait for 8man to lose his cool and rape all of his friends so they stop bitching about stupid shit.    Make Haruno realize genuine things does exist -ultimately repairing her relationship with Haruno.    To convience Yukimom to not make Yukino change from International Liberal Arts to the Sciences and/alternatively nor make Yukino go aboard overseas.    A request that'll resolve all their issues (Yukino dependency, Hachiman genuine, Yui whatever it may be) and easily tie up the story and any lose ends Oregairu did had to conclude the story.   Yukino's request has to pretain to her family, herself, or the Service Club; Watari can't be this insane to make Yukino request unreasonable.          Did he know the ending when he wrote the first 4 volumes? Because anything after 6 is a completely different animal   Good Irohasu, everyone!     Needs Hayama's face on it.    If she really wants to get over her dependency issues, shouldn't she deal with all those issues herself?  All she has to do is to confront the possibility of being hated, get over it, and tell her family what she feels. I could understand her wavering before, as she was close to no one and thus she didn't want to risk the chance of her own family hating her, but she has no reason to doubt any more.  That done she can go back to be herself, or start finding out who she wants to be.          Yui goes yandere after two minutes of spacing   Yukino an heros on the spot   Hayama pops a boner, doesn't know why   Iroha respects her game        It's not rape if they consent.     Hayama pops a boner, doesn't know why   NTRfags, pls     AFTER EP 13  WATASHI WA WAKARANAI ! WAKARANAI ! WAKARANAI     He wouldn't want them to consent.    We're all agreed that the best end would be with Irohasu because she's the best girl for him and it would keep the club together right?     Yukino  Missionary/Face to Face  Yui  Doggystyle and everything that Hikki wants  Iroha  Cowgirl, 69, Leglock Missionary  Saki  Spooning, Reverse Cowgirl            Yukino  Missionary  Yui  Doggy  Iroha  Cowgirl           Good.    Stop depressing me with things that will never happen.      F-FUCK YOU YUI IS COWGIRL BEST GIRL        the fuck is the difference between the two cowgirls     I think anything to do with Yukimom is basically off limits for anyone but Yukino. Not only would Hachiman be unwilling to go that route, he's not really able to help her either with that. Helping Yukino with Haruno depending on the exact request may be alright. But Yukino has to be the one to take the stand in the end. Just like she did with Haruno at the end of the culture festival arc, which left Haruno impressed.  It's important that we not overthink her dependency issues. The solution to them is not isolating herself from her friends or acting like she has to carry the whole world on her own shoulders. It's understanding the difference between what's reasonable to ask others to help you with and what's not. Even in this series, Yukino has not always been the doll blindly following other people that she showed in the last few episodes.       Haruno takes 8man home back to Yukino's apartment with Iroha in tow.  Haruno drags 8man to Yukino's room and undresses him.  Iroha pops in and starts taking pictures.  8man asks wtf is going on.  Haruno says she wants to help his kouhai learn about sex so she would know what to do with Hayama.  Iroha joins in midway.  Blah blah blah please cum inside, ahegao, i'll only be like this with you sempai, take responsibility.                Reported Called the cops Sent your IP to moot      On top towards/on top facing away.   Are Yukino's feelings for Hachiman just dependence, or is there love mixed in there as well? Or is it love, with the dependence bit of it just showing clearly?  Yui obviously has feelings for Hachiman.  Hachiman obviously has feelings for Yukinoshita.   Although everything's built up for a Yukino end, it's just hard to imagine that working in practice, and the dialogue just doesn't feel like it'd work at all (can't have a book full of spaghetti, it'd ruin the pages). Whereas Yui end would be easy to see. I guess... we'll just have to wait again. The long wait.          You know if there was some parallel universe where I could transport 8man here I think the first thing I would do is go to sad panda.      moot  who?      Iroha gives the pictures to Hayama   Keiaku doori  Hayama fapped good that night        I can't even tell if you're being serious.    I'm not saying Yukino should shoulder everything, but confronting her parents and overcoming the fear of being hated are things only she can do. No one can help her with that.       one day this will be a true statement        The actions she takes while not in dependence mode indicates she does truly like him. The v day chocolates come to mind and how she wanted to give them to him.     Well that's what I said as well in terms of her parents. I'm not so convinced that the service club needs to be hands off in regards to Haruno. Since they all already have a relationship with Haruno and Haruno herself has involved herself in their affairs.  But even with Haruno it's something Yukino has to take the initiative on and stand up to her. Or else Haruno will never stop tormenting her and the service club.       Founder of 9gag.    She definitely has romantic feelings for him. However, she's too deep into her own personal issues she likely isn't fully aware of them and she won't act on them either, given she's such a mess right now.     Ah, I should have elaborated. I think the request will help them subtly resolve their own issues individually while working collectively as they did the other requests.  While Hachiman handle Yukino request it'll make him realize the genuine he was in search of. Whereas Yukino the request will serve as the progneitor to resolve her dependency on her own.   If that make any sense.       Commie pls give me status on subs   muh job anon    I think whatever Haruno does will be over once Yukino overcomes her own issues.  Though I think there's more to Haruno's actions than just trying to help/force her little sister overcome her personal problems, I think whatever is left of Haruno's actions will be something a Yukino that has overcome her issues can deal with alone.      It's not necessarily dependence, more of a "cant do anything by herself" thing. Haruno frequently makes comments referring to that specifically.  She doesn't necessarily follow what other people say, she just isn't able to run a decision-making system herself. Obviously this is probably going to run straight into the Hayama engagement issue (probably had hella NTR guilt feelings when she read the penguin descr). She needs to deal with it of her own volition. Stand up for her life. Its hard to see how Watari's going to write that in, because we get a very incomplete humanization of all of the characters aside from our narrator.  You have to consider the entire premise of it all. Houshi-bu, where they fulfill requests on demand. The entire club symbolizes Yukino's inability to make her own decisions. On a macro scale, that is. I don't quite like how obvious he's made her dependence issue in this volume, but I suppose, since it's such a big part of her story, he has to.  Haruno as a character needs to be expanded on much more. There are still many holes to fill before we reach our finale, methinks.          see  Everyone knows she loves doggystyle.      She's in love with him, she knows she has problems, Hikigaya knows she has problems.  He's already shown she can't be depending on him and tells her she must face her own problems.      I get what you're saying /a/non, but can any Yahari character beat Ishikki IROHA? And I'm not talking about Yahari Oregairu first season’s secondary/omitted Ishikki IROHA. Hell, I'm not even talking about Feel’s Yahari Oregairu Zoku best girl Ishikki IROHA either. I'm talking about Watari’s original LN GENUINE Ishikki IROHA best waifu school council president, praised on /a/ (capable of infinite creation of THREADS), with her ability to hand over bags (which grant her control of 8MAN, with his ability of sacrificing himself for saving Kawasaki Saki, Ebina Hina,Totsuka Saika, Tobe Kakeru, Yui’s dog, the Cultural Festival and the Christmas Event) and infinite sexiness (capable of make you take responsibility), a wonderful voice (capable of calling you SENPAI), absolute control of the student council and the COMMIE Irohafags (capable of DANK MEMES), with Yuigahama’s face and tears implanted on her chest, capable of YAHALLO, btfo Yukino and steal 8man from everyone BEFORE the novel ends and KILL that fucking cunt.    How do you kill what is already dead?    That's what Watari wants you to think    That's what she wants you to think  fu fu fu       we get a very incomplete humanization of all of the characters aside from our narrator  This is true. Oregairu would have been a lot better had we been able to read the story through other character's PoV. It would have been able to help them feel more fleshed out, as we would be able to have a better understanding on how they think.       I bet she is just being a cunt with ulterior motives of her own.  Get your own friends old hag      She was present for more than half the volume and her last scene with 8man was him actively flirting with her for the first time ever, scene ended with her thinking about something then walking away while 8man licked the rest of the chocolate saying "too sweet..."  That's Watari's way of making you buy volume 12 to see where that is going after all the club drama that just happened at the end of volume 11      That's a terrible bet. The LN can't be more obvious.   Where are the fucking subs?    8man stops her from giving up on the 8bowl    8man's refusal to show romantic feelings for anyone   Are these two contradicting? I'm still confused.        not entirely sure wtf you're getting at, but iroha's been made too perfect to have a central role in the series.Also was added far too late. If you want, you can argue very effectively that the genuine thing Hachiman is searching for is Iroha (or his sister), because he puts on no facade with either of them, and genuinely enjoys a good dynamic with each. Iroha obviously harbors feelings for him, but he will never truly notice her.  Unless they expand her story. That'd be The Good Shit.  I need more Iroha dates.       A) Does Yui love 8man B) Does Yukino love 8man C) Does Yui know Yukino loves 8man, If B is true D) Does Yukino know Yui loves 8man, If A is true E) Is there a real deal love triangle       They won't be out for another 5-6 hours.    Maybe    All of the above.    with the blade of 1000 truths   Im not sure how I liked how Watari handled Yukinoshita. She's supposed to be the "main girl" since everything in Oregairu ultimately boils down to her and her interactions and problems. hachiman has pretty much reached peak development (barring his girl issue), Yui has no real problems except Hikki. Yuki meanwhile has problems that havent ended for several volumes now   At the beginning she was ice cold queen but at least Hachiman admired her for one reason or another. The height of her development was when she stood up to Haruno at the culture festival  Vol 7-9 we get introduced to the stuco election arc that was pretty for her and then 10/11 we get dependency/identity/no courage issues that never keeps ending. What the hell happened to her? Where's the Yukino Hachiman has always admired?  I'm hoping that Watari actually can give her a good ending; its obvious that she will redeem herself by the time the series ends but will it be enough   Her feelings for him are just as genuine's as Yui's; her problem is that she is unsure how to express her feelings (think she is the one most afraid of being rejected by Hachiman honestly) coupled with her family issues. Oh and now she knows that Yui has feelings for him too.             Yui: I don't want to be genuine   8man: Be genuine   TL  Yui: I don't want romance in the club so I am giving up   8man: Be genuine  8man unwittingly set forth a love triangle. He doesn't see the romance in her words. Yukino did.              Come on, I think NTR is shit and people who like it legitimately have braindamage, but it's still funny as hell.  Probably because it makes fun of NTRfags, actually.     where are those fucking subs   I see thanks.  I now get the "YUI TRIES TO SINK HER OWN SHIP" "8MAN SAVED YUI'S SHIP" memes that was being spammed earlier in the day.      How did it work out last time?   not well      So it seems to me that in all likelihood that a corresponding OVA will be bundled with the last LN.    being a normie unironically     tfw waiting until 2016 to see a true end animated maybe     I dunno. It's easy to drift into pedantic arguments on Yukino's issue.  I realize you're not really claiming otherwise, but all I really have to say about Yukino's issues is that there's a school of thought on these threads that somehow the only way Yukino can ever take a step forward and deal with her issues is if she totally divests herself of her friends and goes it completely alone. And I think that's bullshit.  I am completely convinced that in whatever character growth Yukino undergoes in the next 1/2 volumes, her friends are going to be integral to it. Not in a "let me go talk to Yukimom for you" or "Here is word for word what you need to say to Haruno" way, but in a "we're here for you and we care about you so tell us about what ails you and maybe we can give you a different perspective on it" sort of way. That sort of support you can give to a person no matter what their problem is, no matter how personal and off-limits it is for you act directly on their behalf.  So in regards to Haruno, Yukino has to stand up to her. She's going to have to make a personal decision on what the right course of action is, but she need not figure everything out on her own. That's not a truly human way of dealing with problems. To get rid of Haruno (and I do think that Yukino's request is likely to be 'help me restore my relationship with Haruno and get her out of my apartment') Yukino will have to confront her and win, just like she did at the culture festival early in the series. And showing Haruno that there are genuine bonds will help with that as well, since the Evil Tyrant King does not believe in them.            If Yukino doesn't win, I'm killing myself.   thank god hopefully she doesnt win then   I wonder what would happen if Orimoto showed up again. I wonder what the girls would do if they found out he was still interacting with her.   More like didn't get to work because 8man did his thing again.    If I die when I'm killed them I'm killing myself.     Well she said she would give him chocolate. She still has yet to do that unless I've missed something.  She will show up.        I never realized how much I wanted this until now. It helps how well drawn it is.   I think it might go well with this    More content when, I wonder if they'll bring up the student council problem, when more drama due to miscommunication or lack of comes up.        So Haruno wants her sister to overcome her issues and be able to stand up for herself and find her own path.  It seems to me that Yukimom may have the opposite agenda. She may prefer a compliant Yukino for her own goals, for example regarding Hayato.  If Yukino restores her relationship with her sister. And Haruno and Yukino both confront her mother, that might be a battle they can win. I wonder if that's going to be the path.      COMMIE YOU FUCKING ASSHOLES IT'S CLOSE TO MIDNIGHT   SUB WHERE     east coast pleb    8 hours maybe   http://commiesubs.com/yahari-ore-no<wbr>-seishun-love-comedy-wa-machigattei<wbr>ru-zoku-my-teenage-romcom-snafu-too<wbr>-13-is-not-important-only-camilla-i<wbr>s-camilla-hype-post-camilla-hype-po<wbr>st/</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>    So Haruno wants her sister to overcome her issues and be able to stand up for herself and find her own path.  I don't know anymore at this point, Haruno felt really malicious when she appeared.     It's not even close.     actively flirting     What the fuck happened to FE     Haruno was the Yuigahama of the Hayama arc      using normie unironically     So he lied to her?    It got better  Pre awakening nerds be mad tho     Is Jojo the best anime ever?  No. Part 1 was cool, Part 2 was awesome, Part 3 was cool but too long imo.   My Little Bizarre Adventure: Stands are Magic   I'll concede to you that Part 1 is the greatest Hero's Journey in Anime/Manga history and that Part 2 is a decent followup. Part 3 is pure garbage.      No fucking way dude!  I'll be sure to value an opinion from someone who has never read the manga!  Thanks for your post!       Best manga ever.   No, stop ruining the fanbase you goddamn newfaggots    The best anime ever doesn't exist.    Part 1-2 were the weakest part of Jojo. Please leave the Jojo fandom.   Does this look like the face of mercy?   It looks like the face that makes me want to suck on his tromboner.   Looks like a face of a slut.   Reina, please.   I want to punch sensei.   The face of my husband   Does KyoAni get off on baiting/trolling /u/fags?  First there was Tamako Love Story  Now there is Hibike with episode 8 into sensei confession.   Next there was episode 11 into adding filler scenes of Shoe1 sucking at trombone to give a way to bond with Kumiko again into Reina getting jealous over spending time with Taki.  Why do they do this?           Where did these come from?   Like moonlight   Not him, but found this one too. No clue where they're from though.     Jesus Christ, Kumiko. Get good you fucking scrub.       As far as I can tell, yuri implies explicitly lesbian attraction, romance, relationships and so on. The yuri crowd in Hibike threads certainly hoped as much.   But the thing is, yuri can be both. It can be both explicit lesbian attraction, and strong friendship with romantic subtext. Most of the yuri is of the former category.  The same applies to this show as well. Look at the arguments yuri crowd is making right now, posts like  and  - they're saying that they're "winning" since they're getting the subtext.  It's clear to everyone that they wanted the explicit kind of yuri to happen, but since everyone considers both kinds of yuri yuri, now they can try to fall back on the other kind of yuri and pretend they were happy with just subtext all along. Because in the end they're both equally valid kinds of yuri. If yuri was considered exclusively explicit lesbian content, they would not attempt to make these arguments.         He's still barely had any screen-time. I don't really know what the fuck Kyoani are doing with him at this point. Are him and Kumiko supposed to be friends again now that they've practised together and shouted at one another? Is his "arc" over? Will they suddenly give him more focus in the very final episode? Shouldn't they instead focus on tying up the band performance and the Kumiko-Reina relationship, seeing as those have been given much more significance? I'm worried that they're going try to put too much stuff into the finale.         BDs     Despite the band supposedly playing for 12 minutes during the competition, I can't imagine half the episode being music only. At best we'd get half of that time, meaning there would still be some ~18 minutes to spend on everything else.  Maybe we get some flashbacks or Kumiko's inner monologue during their play time.      The're really good.  guess I am buying BDs       The're really good.  Check out Asuka's hands.     You know 30 minute episodes aren't actually 30 minutes right?  Most episodes run 24 minutes.        i can also see them skip the op and have time for character interactions before the day they perform.     It wouldn't be Kyoani otherwise.    You might want to brush up on your basic arithmetics, anon. 12/2 + 18 = 24.    Read my post again. Music is supposed to be 12 minutes. I said it can't be more than half of that. Half of 12 is 6. 6 plus 12 is 18. 18 (non-music) plus 6 (music) is 24.       I'm sad we may never reach asuka or oboe arc especially asuka arc since they already showed us theres more to her character  Kyoto Animation is Satan.   I just want them to focus on music and less on relationship stuff.   Threads have been absolutely awful ever since the /u/ wars started, even if the shipping only takes like 30 seconds an episode.      I'm pretty sure we'll get season two.  There was a lot of focus on Asuka this season, and they showed us Oboe-chan quite a lot despite her playing no role whatsoever in this season. They probably wouldn't do this if they had no plans for a season two.  Remember, Kyoani decided to make this anime because they liked the story and wanted to share it with everyone. They weren't hired by publishers to make it, nor did they adapt their own original material. They went out of their way to contact publishers and get the rights on the story just because they liked it. The only way I could see this series not getting a season two if season one was a flop - which wasn't the case.         I skimmed through the post. I read `12 + 18 mistakingly.    That smile. I want to play a duet with Kumiko.   Shuichi and Reina have it good.     Yeah, music end would be the best end. I don't know if we can really expect Kyoani to dedicate half the episode to playing music though, especially considering how little they've given us so far. They haven't set a very promising precedent.    Same I'm starting to wonder why they called the anime "Sound Euphonium" and not "The Schrödinger's Yuri"    Last episode is directed by Yamada.   This is some high-level pottery craftmanship     yfw we still haven't seen a trombone-UFO duet between sui1 and kumiko        I want to punch sensei.   Why would you want to do that?       I dont think Shuichi's was a duet. They basically wantwd to out do each other, notice how shuichi tried to blow harder. They want to get better than the other afterall. I'm actually seeing a cute rivalry.     Why does Reina have a beer bottle on the window? Is she an alcoholic?     Thats soap.    This is clearly a beer bottle.    Nope. Soap.    Kek    I didn't really see it that way. It struck me as more mutual support. Hearing the one play made the other want to keep practicing, and vice versa. It wasn't really a competition between the two.    Looks more like a wine bottle than a beer bottle. Beer bottles don't usually have labels or foil on the neck.    No idea how it is in Japan, but in Europe they do. I mean, not always, but it is pretty common. I can think of more beer brands that have foil on the neck than the ones that don't.      It's too big to be a beer, looks more like a wine bottle.    It could be, but then again, Japanese are a very tiny people. Reina is less than 160cm tall. It might just look big in comparison. It wouldn't look as big if it was next to a normal sized person in a normal sized bathroom.     Huh, all the bottled beer I drink in Denmark is without neck labels. Maybe cause I usually get the ones that cost 4kr, which is like 60 cents. If I want good beer, I get draft.    Is that Dick Tracy?   This thread has gone to an unexpectedly stupid place.   Would you prefer the usual shit-flinging instead?    That's weird. I know for a fact that Carlsberg beers that are sold over here have neck labels. I guess it's just a marketing thing, bottles might be different in different regions.       ever crossed the highway to comfort Kumiko   tells her that he'll improve more than her instead   So much for his 'love' for Kumiko.        Honestly Midori wasn't this bad in TLS. It felt natural and had a nice conclusion. But this shit nearly ruined the series. It felt too forced. They should've toned it down after ep 08 and gave Shoe1 more screentime so that people can enjoy more banter.    They thought the story would make them money without Kodakwa jewery. It didn't. They are going to the next project anon. KyoAni is a profit based company. That's literally the only reason Free exists.    Just because they're a profit based company doesn't mean that all they care about is profit and that they can't do some projects they love even if they know it won't make them a shitload of money.  The novels themselves weren't exactly very popular to begin with, so it's not like they would have hoped for Free-tier sales. I'm sure they're more than happy that it made them a profit.      But that's from the novels. Shoe and Kumiko don't talk in the first novel from the mountain date to the end of the first volume. The conversation they had in this episode was anime original.   Stop lying, Aoi. You clearly regret quitting the band.   Then they should've changed the script like they always did. The Reina Kumiko relationship felt too fucking awkward and it didn't feel right. Compare that to the infatuation of Midori.   WHERE IS OBOE-CHAN?   That bottle have some sort of a swing-top. So I agree with the beer.     7k sales   novels sold out instantly   Kyoani shop   Not profit  Why are people so fucking stupid when it comes to Kyoani and money?        Yes it is decent. But it isn't selling as much as Free. Every studio wants to sell as much as they can. And they will continue to iterate on their stories until they find their next Free.    Reina would have played her trumpet so loud all the cars would stop, then crossed the highway.    It's really just the case of people obsessed with (loving or hating) yuri blowing them out of proportion. After episode 8, the only scene that could be considered even remotely awkward was the episode 11 confession of love scene, and that's only if you didn't pay attention to the show and their relationship at all. All their other scenes, rest of the episode 11 scenes, episode 9, 10, and 12 scenes, made it perfectly obvious they're nothing more than just friends.  It's just that the internet is filled with retards who are obsessed with shipping, and they mess with your perception of these scenes.      Wait KyoAni actually added in extra Shoe? Why would they do that when they don't even get together until the last book.    Prove it. What makes you claim such a bold move?  Also, just shut up, let's go for the music end.      Shoe didn't struggle in the novels like he did in the anime. All scenes with him from episodes 11 and 12 were completely anime original.    Out the window     every studio wants to sell as much as they can   So why did Yamada opt to do Tamako Market when she could've done K-ON season 3?  "the slot that eventually became Tamako Market was originally intended for a possible K-On! season three. It was director Yamada Naoko (山田尚子) who pushed for a break from the highly successful franchise in favor of an original work. "   The answer is because sometimes people want to do what they enjoy        Reminder that Asuka is a slut   BD sales make up a small portion of profit. Source material and merch are way more important. Stop pulling information out of your ass.    I-I just want a music end   Why did big bad Kyoani bait us so hard?   It was obviously yuri!  Why are yurifags so fucking delusional?      Kyoani does not own source material and gets literally 0 yen from novel sales. They were not hired by publisher to make an anime adaptation of this novel to advertise it. They bought the rights for the anime adaptation on their own.     I really dislike these Kyoani's designs. They have something wrong. I don't know what, but I feel the bodies are horribly disproportioned and the characters have deformities.   7k is not that much, the novels are not published by them, we have no idea how much stuff they sell at their shop. Not to mention the budget for this show is also above average for Kyoani      all that money wasted on making Hazuki and Midori merch that no one will buy       Kyoani gets no remuneration for novel sales  Ok. Still waiting for you to post a source for any of the shit you're spewing.     They've been selling a lot of merchandise from their own shop http://kyoanishop.com/shopbrand/wor<wbr>ks_HE/page1/recommend/  The selection has nearly doubled since the first couple weeks so probably people are buying it.  </wbr>      It has a high budget because I said so  I want this meme to die.     Kyoani is running low on budget to make episodes now. It can't be helped.    The only thing she regrets is not kicking Asuka in the dick.    the mug is adorable  although wouldn't a bass clef make more sense for a mug handle than the treble one? Besides, don't euphs play on the bass clef?       It does not have high budget because I said so  I'm pretty sure those backgrounds don't grow on trees, The show has the best digital composition in the studio's history, far above anything from their recent stuff. Studio time is expensive and there must have been lots of recording for the OST, instruments, VA.     Plebs don't know what a Fa clef is anon, they only know the Sol one.    Post a single real fact to back up what you're saying or shut the fuck up. Kyoani shows have been shown to have average production costs and be a result of proper planning and business structure.     Throwing money to the trash  Sasuga Kyoto Animators     That doesn't look like human skin. Some kind of plastic, rather.     the table has breasts   asuka's chest is pressing against them      7k is rather a lot, and I'm not sure where you heard about the budget.    Lurk more, retard.  It's been discussed literally a billion times in these threads already. And if you're too stupid to use the archives, you can just look it up yourself.  You can look up the official site and see who is in the production committee for the anime and who isn't. You can look up the fucking novels on fucking Amazon and see who's the publisher. You can google for interviews, and find numerous reposts of a translated interview where its explained how the anime adaptation was made because two Kyoani producers, Eharu Oohashi and Riri Senami read the novels and were fans of them and decided to approach the publisher of the novels for the rights for an anime adaptation.         I think it looks like a drawing.  :^)      Kyoani shows have been shown to have average production costs  This never happened.   Post a single real fact to back up what you're saying or shut the fuck up  lel, open your eyes. If every Kyoani show looks good because of proper planning and business structure, then why does this one look better than other Kyoani shows? Did they say: "ok guys, we need to plan this even better than usual!", or maybe they just spent more money on it?        https://twitter.com/erkin_kawabata/<wbr>status/589384655796731904  "Kyoani shows do not have a higher budget than other studios"  -Erukin Kawabata  </wbr>    Yes. He looks like an android or something strange. Definitely not human.    Can't unsee it    Oh, the archives actually have the contract agreement Kyoani agreed to and you're not making baseless speculation like a fucking retard who believes every shitpost he reads on /a/?    Oh, I get it. You're not just a lazy retard. You're a genuinely stupid retard who thinks there's a possibility of Kyoani making a contract with publishers that makes the publishers give Kyoani royalties from the novel itself because they're making an adaptation of it.  Well, I certainly feel foolish now for wasting my time trying to talk to you.      Ok, so you don't have a single fucking fact and are relying entirely on speculation just like the other retards who think Kyoani shows have some giant budget.     he's rude because he doesn't understand human emotion   the band teaches him how to love      Because she went to meet Kumiko in the middle of the night at a deserted train station, just because she got a phone call? When her parents think it's dangerous?    liking cumiko    It only has 32 operative hours left.    Kumiko? More like Cum Miko  Reina? more like REEEEEEEEEEEEEina     I'm going to marry Kumiko!     That's because he's a cartoon character. Why are assburgers so fucking autistic?      Makes more sense. I've had shower beers but bath wine seems like a good and relaxing idea.    Not if I do it first!    literally perfection      Watcha doing there, bottle-kun?      Is Reina collecting Kumiko-bottles?   Delicious NTR  I actually think we might get a Shu1 end next episode. This show isn't selling well enough for a season 2 with Kyo Ani's budget.   They added filler scenes of Shu1 sucking at trombone for the two to make up and do autistic yelling at eachother for a reason.     7000~ sales is still good, maybe not enough for S2 but it's not failure territory  Kyoani doesn't spend more than other studios making anime, how many times do we have to tell people that       in the middle of the night  Not really. This is summer break in Japan, which is late July - August, the sun sets around 6-7pm there at that time of the year.   It was probably around 9pm when they met.       Those few seconds of footage hardly make up for all the scenes of his that they cut down on or removed, but I wouldn't be surprised if you're right.  I hope Kyoani realises they've fucked up and that they're now going for a pure music end, but I have my doubts.      I can't read moon  Blue is reality, red is Reina's imagination.      I hope Kyoani realises they've fucked up and that they're now going for a pure music end, but I have my doubts.   kyo ani pls.. I'd love this         pure music end   The truest, purest form of love.       preggo Kumiko  o-oh my    This show is funny, one episode is yuri bait level max, then next ep is absolutely hinting het end. It like all the episode directors are not connect together, one director want to follow the novel, then on next ep other director want to make an anime original.  Kyoani's shows are usually beautiful, stunning, gorgeous background, but the way they direct the story is always seems to lacks entertain, spiritual, and original.     an anime original  This is the phrase that gives yurifags hope.     They were both in casual clothes, which means that both of them had changed into their pyjamas and were going to bed before Kumiko took an entire train journey to school and back again. Even at school Taki was commenting on how late it was.     one director want to follow the novel, then on next ep other director want to make an anime original  Episode directors didn't write script. It's up to Jukki Hanada and Ishihara when and where to follow the novel.      Hibike Love Story will be original right? Kumiko and Shuichi will work out that friendship is nice too, and Reina will realize that admiration isn't love right? Right?       changed into their pyjamas  Screenshots?     Reina seriously loves Taki in a romantic way.    She doesn't understand love though. She doesn't even understand personal space and how friends are supposed to behave.    She's a special snowflake, she doesn't want to understand how the normals do things.     pregnant   still flat   Being Kumiko is suffering.        this older guy is so mature and nice and passionate about music too.   I'm totally in love, and don't have daddy issues at all      What's to understand? She cares about him very much and is working hard to make his dream come true. That's more than what most people do for their loved ones.         It's not even funny anymore.    <br/>    what's going on    anyone else going to marathon the show once it's over?  <br/>    throws a temper tantrum over his blanket fort   drinks from a juice box  Wow Reina, he's so mature.      lowfat/10    I'll probably watch it all again once all the BDs are out, but not before that.   Man, this euph looks like a fucking pain to draw.    implying it is not a CG trace from a photograph    This thread needs some OTP.    pool episode never     A lot of work for the colorists seems like    Considering the picture shows it draw for shading it's drawn     Still probably a trace though.  Not that it maters since its common practice everywhere.     Wrong one    I'm sure they shaded the areas by hand to show the colorist what goes where. The rest looks like a blueprint though.    Asuka will never love you, Kaori. Settle for Yuuko while you still can, because it's only a matter of time before Natsuki claims her.      You're both retarded.        tfw can't take a bath with my violin      Stay mad Haruka.      shippingshit   ugly art   roleplaying  Fuck off back to tumblr.        tfw you can't do any fun bonding activities with string instruments    Is this fucking shit going to finish anytime soon? Can't wait to get rid of this cancer general.   You forgot the Yamahabux.   kyoani is starting to accept more people into Kyoaniversity http://www.kyotoanimation.co.jp/sch<wbr>ool/course/guideline/2016/  you will never go to Kyoaniversity  </wbr>   whats so great about Taki sensei?   UMAKU NARITAI   No, that's the face of PUT THE FUCKING BLANKETS BACK YOU PIECES OF SHIT.   Last episode airs on 30th, but no matter how it ends, the general will last for at least a week more, and will probably be worse than ever.     応募資格    ①18歳以上25歳まで。   ②高等学校卒業    no requirements outside of graduating highschool           AsukaXKaori  Literally worst.      18 years of age or up to 25 years of age   up to 25 years of age  Ageism strikes again.      the face of quality     Kyoaniversity  What?      Those tuition fees  No thanks.     kyoani has a school    It's a sweatshop training camp for slave animators.     Why did they become so smug ?   Better for prez &amp; vice to get along.    Unlike literally every other anime studio in Japan, Kyoto Animation is not located in Tokyo. They're located it, surprise, Kyoto.  Since most of the talent goes for Tokyo, they just set up their own schools for future animators and other employees. They even have their own writing awards competitions where you can submit your work and if it's good enough Kyoani might buy it and make an anime adaptation of it. That's how we got Free! and Chuunibyou, for example.  Kyoani has been trying to be as self-sufficient as possible lately.        Here's a bunch of graduate projects from the school http://www.kyotoanimation.co.jp/sch<wbr>ool/course/graduate_works/  none of these will ever be anime  </wbr>     Right fagott best smug    Kyoani is supposedly one of the few studios that actually pays its employees a livable wage.    They found out they were best girls.   Reina sure is dense.  I know, I know I've let you down, I've been a fool to myself   She figured she was the best all along.     tfw can't with my sax either  I don't trust my trombone well enough to bathe with it. It'll probably shank me and leave me to bleed out or something.     After they got screwed over with Haruhi it's quite understandable why they want to be as independent as possible.    all those newfags taking 3MB screen shots     drunk girl thinking a trashbag is a cat      Does Kyoto have Second City syndrome?  http://theprotocity.com/second-city<wbr>-syndroms-ever-lasting-rivalries/</wbr>        Second City syndrome?  That's Osaka. Kyoto is pretty smug about its history.      Cheeky cunts.    I intentionally take larger screenshots just to mess with shitters with bad internet. I also save reaction images with blue background as opposed to the ones with transparent background to mess with shitters who use that edgy tryhard Tomorrow theme.     I don't like it. They're still the best girls though.      Unlike literally every other anime studio in Japan   Stop, you clearly do not know what you're talking about.    Kyoto   Kyoto Prefecture isn't Kyoto.          STILL best girl    They learned about their fanbase on /a/. Right is best.      that third short     Seo?     Kyoto Prefecture isn't Kyoto.  Wut?     I could easily hear KanaHana's voice watching that.    Right after her best friend that is.    oh, I didn't realize that Osaka was that far ahead of Kyoto. After looking it up, Kyoto really isn't a competitor to Tokyo.    Osaka is a commercial powerhouse while Kyoto is more of a cultural city.     what are Prefectures     still trying too hard, but you still have your place as second of the session    I bet all of them are better than Hanada    But Kyoto city is the capital of Kyoto prefecture. Are you trying to say that KyoAni isn't in Kyoto just because its in Uji right next door?       Anon I'm genuinely sad that you cannot acknowledge such a beauty and go for the second best willingly.    Specify what you're talking about. There is a difference between Kyoto City and Kyoto prefecture. Uji is a city.   It's perfectly fine to argue the point here when you claimed that it's special to be located in Kyoto.       KyoAni releases natsuki merch   suddenly they're millionaires      I bet you're wrong.     that edgy tryhard Tomorrow theme  It's edgy to not want your screen to be as bright as the total light from three different suns when browsing /a/ at night?     I acknowledge her. But she's still second.     This is how beautiful Kumiko would look without that shitty fluffy.   Dude, that's iced coffee    Not that guy. I posted  and this is my second post in this line of replies. I felt no need to specify since I didn't assume a faggot would show up in this thread and start a retarded off-topic discussion just so he can brag about knowing the basics of Japanese administrative system everyone else already knows. Feel free to go read my post again and try to find me specifically using the term city even once.  Now shut the fuck up already, retard.       3rd short     Then I can only agree to disagree. At least you have good taste Anon.    Explain to me why it matters that KyoAni is located outside of Tokyo. And please don't tell it's because of money reasons. And yes, if you want to talk about this and explain KyoAnis situation, you might want to get the details right. For simplicities sake, people don't live in states, they live in cities.  Also, P.A. Works isn't located in Tokyo which means your first sentence is wrong.     She's perfect no matter the hairstyle.  But fluff is still best.      That demure style  She belongs in a chateau.    Remove the fluff. I want to cut Kumiko's hair   Okay so not literally every other studio is located in Tokyo, only 99% of them are. There's a few studios outside, so that obviously invalidates the argument that was used, yeah. Because we're autistic faggots missing the point since we're pretending this is a formal debate and not a fucking anime imageboard where the point is more important than the form.  As for why Kyoani being outside of Tokyo matters, you would know the reason I used if you read my second line in that post. And no, I never used that "it's cheaper" argument.  My point in  is that you're a fucking faggot because you started a completely unrelated city vs. prefecture discussion just so you can brag about knowing that prefectures are a thing and that Kyoani isn't technically in Kyoto itself but in a shitty sub-200k people town literally 15km away from Kyoto. Because the rest of us have obviously never even opened Kyoani's Wikipedia article and seen its location, nope. No one is impressed by you knowing these basic facts literally everyone else knows as well.  Will you now drop this subject now, retard?          That's horrible.  You're horrible.     I want to sell Ribbons into prostitution   Respect the Ribbon.    I would be smug too if I had a fucking fagott.     And no, I never used that "it's cheaper" argument.   I never said you did. It just seems to be the number one go to argument when someone talks about KyoAni and it's location.   As for the rest, that's a lot of projecting. It's very much related when you try to talk about things in "detail" but miss out on the important details.    Let me explain why KyoAni is doing this and that but let's ignore the facts for a second   It has nothing to do with wikipedia and if it did it would be even more embarrassing since I expect normal people to be able to read a simple wikipedia article.            Seriously that shit is expensive.     student model 2000$   god damn high maintinence fagotts  presumably a student version is cheaper than normal too        I still wonder how is a school with capability to buy, store and entrust teenagers with thousand dollars worth of equipment is considered a bad school.    Dude, you're the master of missing the point.    Can you really bathe with brass instruments?     I never said you did. It just seems to be the number one go to argument when someone talks about KyoAni and it's location.  But you see, if you actually bothered to read my post, you would have seen what argument I used. You wouldn't need to guess arguments and decide to use this one argument that's commonly brought up for no reason at all. But then again, if you weren't a retard bringing up unrelated subjects so you can debunk them and feel good about yourself, we wouldn't be having this discussion in the first place, since you wouldn't make that smug city =/= prefecture post in the first place.   As for the rest, that's a lot of projecting.  I know idiots online love to use the term projecting as a generic "no u" rebuttal, but please learn what the term means before using it.   It's very much related when you try to talk about things in "detail" but miss out on the important details.   What are you even on about? What important details have I missed out? Is Kyoani not being technically in Kyoto City but instead in a sub200k people town 15km away from Kyoto City an important detail? Is the fact that Tokyo is only the home of 99.999% of all anime studios and not every single one besides Kyoani an important detail?           You mean the point that you ignored? Not like this discussion is going to have a positive outcome for either side though.    It is a part of the maintance.    Only the one with the valves like the tuba or eupho. Don't do it with anything with keys like a sax.    They must've contracted the smugness off of Natsuki, because god knows how much smug she carries and emits. As for my proof of this: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vGQ<wbr>0ePXQXAk</wbr>  [ ]    I'm not the guy you're arguing with. I was just pointing out that literally every post you make you just pick out some totally irrelevant detail and use it to change the subject.     Don't do it with anything with keys like a sax  Sax is not a brass instrument anyways.      debunk them and feel good about yourself   I know idiots online love to use the term projecting as a generic "no u" rebuttal   Are you retarded? All you throw around is, you like to brag, fell better about yourself and then go on to make up random shit related to a wiki article. And you're claiming that I'm bringing up unrelated shit? How am I supposed to react to something that only holds insults and no actual arguments?   What important details have I missed out?   Is Kyoani not being technically in Kyoto City but instead in a sub200k people town 15km away from Kyoto City an important detail?   It's clearly wrong to say that they're located in Kyoto City but you're right, you didn't say that and I was merely looking for the "Kyoto is less expensive" than Tokyo argument. Mainly due to the fact that pretty much everyone is running with that. So yes I was wrong in pressing the point on that specific argument.           <a href="https://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1435039549102.webm" target="_blank">https://i.4cdn.org/wsg/143503954910<wbr>2.webm</wbr></a><br/>   What does tak say in vol 3 when Reina confesses her feelings for him?

It's nothing like K-On!  it's more like Free! except with yuribait instead of fujobait       no requirements outside of graduating highschool   Basically the norm for any sort of trade school. Art jobs for stuff like illustration, concept art etc. really don't give a shit about college qualifications. They just want to see how well you can paint/draw for them. Here it's the same thing, kyoani just want to see how good of a draughtsman and how passionate you are about this field and if you're willing to go all the way. Given how badly paying animation is in Japan, the only people that apply anyway are people who are doing it as a labour of love.          No.  Its K-On with Azunyan as every character.     Oh, you know exactly where the next location will be.      He's perfect hubby material     Every character is worst girl  Jesus      <br/>   Do it.   I can honestly see it going like this.   is there more of this?    No. Deep down Reina is only into girls. You know it's true.    thank you based anon    they used to be a top tier music school when Taki sensei's dad was around, but he left and ten years later the music club went to shit. Now it's up to Taki and Reina to drag them back to Nationals   I HATE IT   it's japan they'll commit sepukku if they scratch their instruments     I wonder if Kaori knows that Yuuko's true love is actually Natsuki and not herself    the only time Reina actually acts like a normal highschool girl     Taki and Reina   Not Takie and Oboe-chan   She's the true talent.       hey, even when horribly depressed, Kumiko is still the queen of bantz    That was so fucking adorable. Reina had good development.     that Reina slut thinks she's so special   doesn't even use a double reed   I hope my reeds are done soaking        I'd soak Taki's dick    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8Gv<wbr>ML2w377k</wbr>  [ ]   tfw you'll never visit Kyoani's shop      Reina doesn't let up, Take should just submit to his fate.    They really are Reina and Taki.  Someone edit this.      no instrument gachapon out front  Why do you hate money KyoAni?     Being Mamiko is suffering. What is she studying anyway? Biotechnology, statistics, nanotechnology, etc.?    She is dead inside. Her oboe is the her last attachment to life most likely    slackers continue to be BTFO    Fucking rekt. Her sister wouldn't even be recognized by her mother after that carnage.    I thought imoutos were supposed to be sweet and loving?   say something nice about Kumiko    btfo while facedown in her bed     I haven't forgotten that you said you could do it.    She'll get better.      She has a nice ass.    meep meep    I want to aggressively  grow old  with Kumiko    That, shes does.     Don't you find it beautiful how, after the ED, ep8 and ep11 those who wanted a yuri end got literally blown the fuck out by a simple dropped bottle? Because I do.   did Taki hit that?    Taki walks like an old man    I wish you existed so we could  hold hands  all day long     Shhh, they're still in denial stage.     Yuri is still confirmed     That 2nd one with the drunk Christmas Cake   KyoAni needs to make a SoL with adult characters.      How and why     In their delusional minds of course     Anon, its about time you realized "yuri end" is shitposting. Yuri is just fanservice. The ED has it, the promo art has it, and the show has it.    This is literally the only place in the whole west internet where users recognize it's nothing but fanservice. Everywhere else is butthurt and tears and it makes me so happy.    she's the greatest and will conquer reina's heart     whole west internet  Don't waste your time with that garbage.      i see people hoping for a yuri end since taki sensei wont reciprocate reinas feelings      since taki sensei wont reciprocate reinas feelings  Of that we'll never be sure. I've read enough shoujo manga with significan age gaps to know they can actually work into something cute, specially when the younger one is so devoted. It's usually the other way around, with the old fuck trying to score. But here Reina is the thirsty one. It seriously makes for something great. Like this <br/>       I laughed my arse off at this scene.   I just lurk though. Experience has taught me 4chan is the only worthy place on this side of the internet. Everywhere is literally shit.   Last episode fuck i hope someone picks up the mango   I would walk like the prime of my life is over if my wife died.    Are you kidding me its always the student that wants the teacher. You should try Hirunaka no Ryuusei it has a great Teacher and Student relationship.    I want to shave her head and keep the hair in a glass display and worship it every morning.    I cried because it confirmed KumkoxShoe1 end.    I did say age gaps though, which doesn't always involve student x teacher.  Hirunaka no Ryuusei  Fuck you.  And fuck that ending fuck ;-;7.        No it doesnt    Does anyone think this show is building Kumiko up to be the next, next buchou?  Do you think she'd make a good one?     I can't see it happening. Natsuki will be next bucho, Maybe Sapphire-chan after that.    She died a loooooooooong time ago. It's time to move on.    A vote for Sakai, is a vote for best girl.    Natsuki's the next vice-buchou. Ribbon is the next buchou.    I see, but its still always the younger one that wants the older one.  This is the only age gap relationship I like, Those two were made for each other    What if Taki-sensei's dead wife looks a lot like Reina?  The last time Shoe had a weiner on his hand was ep 9. Bring back the true OTP kyoani.   Then all hope is lost.  Anytime he sees her naked, he'll just start crying.     It's a little difficult to say given she's only a first year. We'd need to see how she behaves when given kouhai. Also, it's a matter of what it means to be a "good buchou". Haruka is the current one and she only got the role because everyone's first choice wouldn't take it. Regardless, she still does a pretty okay job.  Kumiko has proven she has the guts and courage, however. And I can see everyone thinking of her as being "nice" like Haruka.       This shouldn't even be a question, anon.     and strangely aroused.     Hazuki has a buchou vibe about her.     your the fluffiest!      a pretty okay job.  Pretty okay? She's nice and brings treats, and you say she's only "okay"? Fuck you anon.      Ribbon would be a shitty pres, she clearly playes favorites.     As many anons have said many times, this season will most likely not end with any confirmed romantic feelings that have not already been established. There will be one more Kumiko/Shuichi scene (mostly likely involving stepping on his shoe for ignoring her) and one more Kumiko/Reina scene (most likely Reina and Kumiko putting their hands on each other shoulders and saying, "Ganbatte!" or Kumiko having something "click" in her heart after she hears Reina's solo). Any later adaptations will be influenced by both the direction KyoAni wants to take on the series and the Nips' response. So nothing is set in stone as of yet.    I've read at least 7 titles during the week that are the other way around, I'll see if I bookmarked them and post them f-for reference.     This is the only age gap relationship I like, Those two were made for each other   Who? Yosano and Satsuki or Taki and Reina?         Except Shoe is no longer ignoring her so it doesnt make sense that she'll step on his foot. They'll probably have a monent on the bench or riverside.     She dropped the bottle because Kumiko spent the evening with someone else. It goes both ways retard.    how are you so perfect?    My little anon can't be this clueless!    [/spoiler] Satsuki x Suzume, I honestly can not see Taki with Reina. Suzume with Satsuki made sense to me, their chemistry was so natural.[/spoiler]   Can Kitauji defend their national title the following year, or are the third years too irreplaceable?   If Taki attracts talent it will all be okay.    Once Kitauji becomes known as a good school for brass band, more people are going to be willing to go there. Talented first years will come. Possibly even transfer students.     king of weiners    What colour do you think shoe1 saw?   He can still calm her down without getting his foot stomped. I'm just worried KyoAni will shorten their scene and then give a big yuribait scene before they perform.    there are people on here who think TakiXReina will actually happen and its not just a schoolgirl crush     CTRL + S    You better encourage the fuck out of her, Shuichi. I don't like this kuyashi Kumiko one bit, not one bit.   Kumiko is for smiles and banter, not suffering.      Thank you.     True love always finds a way     transfer students.  I think this will be their best bet. Unless they draw an orchestras worth of Reina tier prodigies from around Kyoto they'll probably take a small step back.     While it is true they have had yelled/played at each other across various obstacles, Kumiko could still pull the fickle card and say, "That's for all the 'other' times for ignoring me." In fact, it would be probably a bigger romantic flag than simply Kumiko stepping on his shoe after no scenes together or having a simple talk down by the riverbank.     there are people on here who think TakixReina will actually happen and its not just a schoolgirl crush      true love   only one sided admission   even the yuri side has had more admissions of love   yuri end is more likely than going to jail end   true music end will happen anyway          and its not just a schoolgirl crush  But it isn't. Reina's love comes from way before. It's pure love. Love so pure it hurts and makes you drop bottles.     doujins fucking when     Love so pure it hurts and makes you drop bottles.  More like love so one sided it makes you panic and drop bottles.    Daily reminder Reina is old enough to marry.  with the consent of her parents    They might alter the scene like they did with the asking out scene. You know the one where Kumiko was the one that ran away flustered.    NOT OVER HERE IN THE GOOD OLD US OF A    Not in half of Europe.    Did you know it was actually Kumiko that was ignoring Shuuichi? The last episodes really showed that.     Baka gaijins. Japan doesn't care.       Schrödinger's Yuri      It's true love and Reina's only romantic interest. Why would you deny a girl true happiness?     japan   relevant   ever  lol enjoy your crumbling society ruled by bitter old men       You're waifu is japanese! wwwwwwwwwwwww     Why would you deny a girl true happiness?  Sometimes life is cruel, and you end up forever alone.     But that's every country.   He shows no mercy. If you can't play well enough, goodbye. Actually he doesn't have much of a personality at all. Character dev is lacking.     Not if she can help it. The strong willed Reina we know and adore is never giving up her love for Taki, so you better cheer on her!     His country isn't run by old man  Pfffffft      implying mai waifu isn't   flavor of the week  hah i bet you feel stupid now     who would have thought hikikomori and ニート is not sustainable?     they already showed us theres more to her character  I hope that beneath her shell she is exactly the same.     I wish I could get your english lingo.     so you better cheer on her!  I'd rather cheer her on to grow up and see that she's not in love like she thinks she is.    why does sapphire look so fucking smug on the cover of the novel. you could compile the smug anime girl image folder from half of /a/ and it still wouldn't be half as smug as her    They might alter the scenes to have Shuichi confess only for Kumiko to say, "I like Reina. And not a just girl friends sort of way. I rabu her". If KyoAni decides to include a scene, they'll most likely follow the novel to some degree. If they don't, it's anyone guess on how the scene will go.    Did you know it was actually Kumiko that was ignoring Shuuichi?  Yes, that's why I described the potential actions as 'fickle'. It's Kumiko's fault, she's just being tsundere about it.         not in love like she thinks she is.  But why do you think that's the case? did your sensei reject you and you're projecting?       But why do you think that's the case?  Because its typical of young people to mistake their feelings for romantic urges.  did your sensei reject you   I am a sensei       ITT: MCs who are spooky skeletons.  I didn't know Raita was doing character design for this.  You go get em, Senpai!    Who's best girl? and why is it Narberal?   The girls are too healthy for Raita. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RuN<wbr>APPcjDr4</wbr>  [ ]       Five rings on each hand  Cheater. Then again, they might not all be magic. Or are they?     Draw a boy    Call it a girl     To be fair one of them is the Guild Ring which so far seems to be pretty useless other than it's teleport.     Draw a girl    Call it a boy     That's still magic.    That's the MC? Picked the fuck up.    Here from a manga that has only been around half a year.   FROSTMOURNE HUNGERS   Yes, he's a lich and his servants are all irredeemably evil.   The maids are all monster girls.   Picked the fuck up.    I think all his servants are non-human, in fact. Could be wrong, though.    Anime version.    I heard that this was mmo/transported to some sort of rpg game world garbage. Are my fears unfounded?    It uses VRMMO as an intro, then trolls SAOfags by using a completely unrelated fantasy world instead. Magic and whatnot exists, but there's no floating statsheet that tells you have 126 STR and 1692 HP.    It's MMO turned real, then transported to some "real" fantasy world.  I found that when the dude was still playing the MMO and describing everything as shit tier last gen garbage pretty interesting.  Still, it uses MMO mechanics to explain shit sometimes (not very often though), which I hate. I still think it's better than most other stuff out there though.        Wouldn't that be Log Horizonfags given the intro is closer to LH than SAO?    I believe you meant Demiurge.    Lich king ripoff?     Is there more concept art of the girls?      Something ain't right.    Mfw i see two semen demons  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127145294  Google search it.  I found it.      i thought we were gonna wait until 27 th.    anyway....cd drama 7 and 8 are out .   Will there be a second PV?   Probably not at this point. Advanced screening in 3 days I believe?     For fuck's sake, Japan.      Blame Teapot-sama      Thought that this was a nice dinner scene.   Oh look, that's a big shrimp tempura the bug maid is holding up.   Those are some weird looking shrimp tails.   Oh my god that's someone's arm.        The blonde got fingers on her plate.    Fingers and Earlobes on Solutions plate    I really really want to see the scene where Solution (Blonde) seduces bandit into grabbing her chest and then proceeds to drag him inside her and melt him slowly while keeping him alive.    Oddly, some of the maids are good-aligned.   I believe  and  are listed as human in their profiles.      I regret that I won't be able to watch this show with /a/. Pic semi related … the softest skeleton.    Aura and Mare are listed as "Human" because YGGDRASIL lumps everything that roughly looks human, as "human". Elves, dwarves, etc. are all considered "Human".      No because LH had regular mouse and keyboard MMORPG.   Who Theocracy here?    I think all his servants are non-human, in fact.  The basic rule of the guild for players was to pick non-human races, so i wouldn't be surprised.   The twins are described as dark elfs in the novel, but  makes sense.        There is only one human an bit is one of the pleiades.She has yet to appear though.    old butler - dragonkin butler - demon prince slut - succubus loli - vampire twins - dark elf maids - dullahan, shapeshifter, bug, android, slime        http://www.alphapolis.co.jp/manga/v<wbr>iewManga/?no=741 Re:monster manga new ch </wbr>   there's also a plate of brains.    Rou being a big dick OG   oh, speaking of Overlord. The first book of the manga just came out apparently.   You forgot. Best girl - giant ice bug monster     LN adaptation   CGI   MMO setting      Incoming ogre orgy.  Also, that Sei. So much best.      Rou get's a loooot of pussy in this series. And I think he fucks some male elves along the way too.    Damnit Entoma, you were NOPE enough as you were.    Can't wait for the show and can't wait for new manga chapter.   I do wonder if he's going to be changing hell and back with the whole skeleton thing.   It's only for one chapter. Then it goes into traditional fantasy. Though some elements still persist.          Dont remember if he did any of the males, they were for the lowest of low of goblins to sate themselves afterall. And yes Rou is drowning in pussy, im still sad Female Knight got sidelined horribly.     CG undeads   CG bone dragons      Eh, she get's her's every now and then    Hoping there are more retards like you that will avoid this show so we can have enjoyable threads    Probably, its not mentioned though. Im still mildly creeped by the Queen and Dark hero 5p.    Rudeus going around in a Orsterd cosplay  I need more of this    Creeped but aroused i might add.    What. He fucked them too? When?    wow you're way ahead of where I am. I stopped reading around them building the story because the TLs became incredibly rough.    He's talking about Ainz.    *store    They should be listed as humanoids, ie predominantly humane features. Demi-humans are then predominantly animal/monster and heteromorphs are the outliers.  Humanoids weakest, Demi-humans are stronger yet can't advance and heteromorphs have "grave weaknesses" while being strongest.       Would you a skeleton?     somewhere between 171-180, it was implied they visited at night, Mi and Redhair joined and fucking ensued. Japan is wonderful language with its double meanings. From what i understood he definately did them. Also theres considering how badly they had started to stalk him so he most likely gave in to make them give him some space.    Yeah, what's the deal with the Queens "religion" that would make the followers stalk him like that?    Meh most likely she realised this thing has the blessing of a highranking god, must have its babies. And then theres there actually being monsterblood in the royal line so mixing in more would make Royal line more powerful.     I was dying when Rou knew they were stalking him and probably masturbating furiously to him banging Mi and Redhair.      Man that full, well shaped jawbone actually makes him look better than the manga.     He's quite manly looking for a skeleton isn't he? It must be the chin.    They use MMO mechanics as a comparison, but eventually it becomes clear that the world they are in has nothing to do with the old game. It's a world that has been historically impacted by players from the game world. but none of the native inhabitants are capable of using game mechanics, with the exception of magic, and even then, very limited low-level magic.  The MC gets transported to this new world, alongside his entire guild and their raid dungeon, of which the bosses and trash NPCs are completely loyal to him, alongside very alien notions of morality. At most, the "gaming" side of the story is focused on the hording mentality of endgame players and guilds, of which gives him and his "children" vast stores of "outdated," but overpowered equipment.        Who are these people    You already know who they are anon. Just think harder.    They're the men in the Kingdom. It says it right there on the side of the picture.   Is this man the spookiest villain in manga?   Nope. But he sure has something of a pervert in him.    I hope author has planned something delicious for them, in the end humanity is there for despair.    One one hand I feel the show is gonna suck, on the other I need more skeletons in my life. Fuck.    Nothing ventured, nothing gained. What's the worst that could happen?    Skeletons you say?   Where is the inquisition when we need them?   Can't wait for the humans to get subjugated and used as livestock or breeding material for the truly powerful.    there are people right now in this thread who dislike Edmoe the Bug.  Pussies. Cocytus, Vasilissa and Prince of Terror are the best NPCs.    Insect bros like Cocytus i can deal with, Entoma on the other hand is the personification of NOPE and terror for arachnophobe.     Even Prince of Terror is afraid .jpg     one is the psycho princess and the one in the right is the blue rose member    Is she the healer?    Well she has a revive spell.    Would fuck all the party, Gorilla excluded. A pity anime won't reach there -&gt; no doujinshi of dem girls.    You could not have prevented this.   Reminder that penguin is best servant.   Penguin a filthy back stabber.    We could have. There was a poll a long time ago whether or not the author would kill her. She lost the poll.   She lived in the WN.     Who is best grill and why is it  maido ?    Are the lns already finished?     Forgot img    Vol 9 and ongoing.     I've only read the manga. Is she the reverse trap adventurer?     Any summary for vol 9?    not yet, as far as i know.     Oh, then I hope in the future there will be someone like Ainz, except he's the polar opposite. A paladin lone wolf hikki who has better gear and stats because he had more free time but no army or manpower.     She is a cute magical girl adventurer and a new voice of guild. No trap of either kind.    Sadly nobody has better gear than Ainz, he holds the entire armoury of the biggest pay to win pk guild in the entire game    And now suddenly I became disinterested.    What did you think this was some hot blooded brink of defeat battle series.  Nah son this series is about a spooky skeleton and his army of monsters dropping in to the middle of the continents weakest kingdoms and getting involved in their politics while gauging strength and trying to find other transported people.       She brutally dies right? ;_;      I heard the reverse-trap dies. Say it aint so. ;_;         Her dead body was cut into pieces: Entoma uses Arche's voice to replace her old voice, Demiurge takes her skin, several undead take her arms and legs, her head is used as decoration for the devils and the leftovers become food.       What about the disguised adventurer in the manga?     Who are you referring to? Momon and Nabe?   In Twitter news, Overlord Volume 1 (manga) is released tomorrow.  Overlord is on the Comp Ace cover.      The reverse trap, never mind, the wiki says it was Ninya and that she died. It didn't say how though.     this much heresy  Fucking cucks can't handle how superior humans are.    I think the descriptions say enough about what happened to her.    it was clementine who killed her.... if you are talking about the black sword member.    Die and become a skeleton, you mosquito!    Raita's women slowly becoming more and more skeleton like   Anons joke about his waifus becoming a skeleton in his next publication   Raita's next project   Skeletons and Skeleton waifus  What's the next step in evolution?       Collaboration between Maruyama, so-bin, and Raita to bring us into a new age.    There is a skeleton inside us all just waiting to come out, /a/non. Deal with it.    You have to steel yourself for the author's M.O., unless one is incredibly lucky or important as human, you most likely end up meeting your end in misery.  Don't say I didn't warn you in advance    He slowly knelt down and gently touched the body. After confirming there was no corpse trap which was common in Yggdrasil, he lifted Ninya’s face. Ninya wasn’t unconscious, but dead.     His face was swollen, probably from the blows of a blunt weapon. Ainz couldn’t recognize him by his face. His left eye was smashed and flowed out of the socket like a tear.     All the bones in his fingers were cracked and the skin split open, revealing the red muscle within. Some places didn't even have meat.     When Ainz removed the clothes for inspection, he was shocked with his eyes wide open. He put the clothes back in place and mumbled: “... Even the body was...”     The body was similar to the face, with wounds everywhere due to severe bleeding. It was covered with the color of internal hemorrhage and it was harder to find a spot that wasn’t wounded.     Ainz closed Ninya’s eyes gently.             still discussing things like race   not having evolved from that cage of flesh     This time around humans don't have anything to back them up, and I enjoy their feeble struggling in the hands of dragons, monsters and now spookies.     This time around humans don't have anything to back them up,  Except the fact that I'm right here right now, whereas dragons and monsters aren't.     Jesus promised the end to the wicked, Odin promised the end to Ice Giants.I don't see many of the latter around so I think your avatar never delivered on his promise.     Friendly reminder that in two more days we will read how the lizardmen die at the hands of Cocytus.     When Jesus said that, he was referring to the dinosaurs, faggot. Read the fucking bible.    I hear they get their just end in ch5 and with luck we might get the whole ch4 on saturday but who knows, hopefully we get something.    How can he promise the end dinosaurs if the world is just few thousand years old?     Dinosaurs   Earth   What the fuck are you on about, nigger? How the hell do you think Jupiter became a gaseous planet?        Weren't dinosaurs martians?       I'm surprised that the twitter actually updated the sprites on time.  Now to wait on Cocytus and Sebastian.   Too bad they aren't going to give out the "real" forms for the Guardians.    You can always force or speed up evolution.     Is this filling some niche between skeletons, accel world, shield hero, and log horizon? Cause i'm up for it.      accel world   shield hero   log horizon  Can you get your shit out of here?       Starts as VR in 21XX, dumps the premise of game and goes for dnd-esque fantasy world that brought in some elements (classes, magics, races). No UI shit or obnoxious stat listing by the numbers.   Everything is tiered from 1-10 and levels are sometimes used as base of "approximate" capability. So it can't get rid of that entirely but they're rare enough.  And MC is a spooky skeleton that doesn't want to go back and tries to play father to his family of demons and monsters while being paranoid and gearing up for world conquest.         Only one mmo anime is shit and it is not on that list. Can you guess which one?     She's a big sister    Boku no hack or shit arts online? Those 3 are even worse.   I found another one guys! http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/wahha<wbr>man-r14481  but he's actualy a golden skeletal cyborg from atlantis  </wbr>     Boku no hack is legendary as the anime join with the games. It is godfather of mmo anime. You must never speak ill of it.  Perhaps it should add it to the list, but i don't think it approaches "mmo buddies conquering the world" like the rest. More like bad &amp; spooky hacks affecting the real world.      Someone reading Ossan rpg? It is interesting. Never thought of a shield-bow. http://www.alphapolis.co.jp/manga/v<wbr>iewManga/?no=743</wbr>     shield-bow  That's stupid. Most shield's aren't very aerodynamic and have very low piercing power. Why would you want to shoot shields?     You don't shoot shields. You use a bow that is at the same time a shield read manga.    Manga Ains looks like a grinning old man.    I want to see him suplex a puny human at some point, one hug wasn't enough. Or crush someone with that chin of his.     That Shalltear is disturbing.     In what way?     The nose.       Does she look Jewish?     wrestling Skelton's   WHY ISN'T THIS A THING?!      Do you even mexico?   <br/>     Can't wait to see all the expressions of Albedo and Shalltear, the ones that they can't show to Papa Bones.    I think they showed him plenty while they were bickering    Not the ones most ill-fitting a proper lady.     Oh like the time Albedo  almost  raped Ainz?     That and the one from the start with her succubus blood boiling.    And Shalltear going all clayface with dislocated jaw.     And wetting herself after the first time Ainz summoned the floor guardians.       Vampire    Wetting herself  Just how crazy-strong are the floor guardians?      She wet herself in the OTHER way anon. And most of them are around 100.    That did occur to me, but I couldn't think of why just summoning the guardians would do something like that.    Though I somehow forgot that she and the others are the floor guardians, so derp.    Ainz summoned them to talk to them, and during their conversation he turned on one of his auras subconsciously. Turns out it was really strong and the guardians were freaking out, although it only turned on Shalltear.    The little one's Neutral Good, too.    The way you said little one makes it sound really cute.    Makes me wonder how she feels about the Evil characters.    well she kind of is little<br/>    It's still kind of stupid. Though, in fairness, not as stupid as some of the shit that actually existed.   So hopefully we get a decent release Saturday.   Probably utterly indifferent, analytical like her creator.    Maybe he's  Thanos.     Is it front-loading?    ch4 is the preparation and "Beginning of Despair", ch5 is the final dance with Uncle Cocytus. No idea how long those are in pages though.    Thanos was this season.    Esh. So much to cover, and such a slow release.    Who is covering the next volume anyways? I thought I heard Keazer was taking care of one and someone else was working on another.    Same team as up to now I believe (FSO+Sky), at least what I gather from following the comments on sky/kaezar blogs. 6th was on Kaezar's to-do list at least and 7th is someone on BT.     I want to get on Mr. Bones wild ride.   Too bad official airing isn't until 7th, hopefully we at least get new information from the event held this weekend.    Shalltear or Albedo pls.      What's got Albedo so aroused?    After being cockteased by Ainz for 9 volumes she finally snaps. Ainz puts her in timeout later.    Does he spray her with a water bottle?    Close enough   Now all we need is a good Castlevania anime    Edits her character setting to want only his dick instead of all the dicks   Proceeds to deny her his dick  Truly Ainz-sama lives up to his evil alignment   resisting boner puns so hard            except green, which was underpowered as fuck.   Lol what the fuck, the early day of green was purely Osaki-Repair/Restoration loop until they had to ban that out of existence for taking up too much time at events.     Thanks a bunch anon, I've been waiting for this since Infected.     Infected's  Track 015  Spread's  Track 008       God damn these are so good.  Spread may have a mountain of issues, but it has one hell of a soundtrack.      I recommed to you listen Spread's entire OST then go to listen Infected's. You will feel these two have different essences. It's very nice how they picked the tracks for each OST.   which sento would you sento?  Is that from the OVA?   If the fairies represent each element, what does Sento represent?  Motherhood, health and fertility?       all dem clothing switches  Sento is FAT in the good way      The heart.     Why choose this ripoff when you can go for the real deal? It'll also be free of social retardation.    Heart, you dolt.     anal pounding    Where's the goddamn raws at?   Why does Snail have child bearing hips? What is this sorcery?    Nevermind, found it.    The one that is not Sento   Sento the BEST Amagi Brilliant Park   Yes.   KyoAni lost its way.  RIP    Facebook filename     I like where this is going.    All the creatures in this show have the same rape face, man.   And I love it, doujins when?      Wrestling anime by Kyoani when?   I wouldn't Sento any Sento.  I'd force her and Kanye to fuck and watch them carefully with my fingers Gendo-style.      One shitty wrestling anime is enough for one decade.     FIRE  ALL, BUT FIRE IS BEST      Where? Can't find shit on nyaa even searching for 甘城ブリリアントパーク     nosub tv   Has Kyoani ever created a more sexual character than Sento?  Oh fuck, totally forgot more OVA's were coming   Her name is Muse.    WHAT YOU GONNA DO WHEN PINK MAYOI RUNS WILD ON YOU?!     she is love       Wait, I know that there were little specials/shorts in every BD release, but I didn't hear about any full length OVA eps.   9 pages of doujins     I'd any Sento.   Jesus Christ those Sento's   Conversely, not having any Sento's makes her head look really big when wearing that outfit       sento is  T H I C K H I C K           Just. Pure. Sex.          The fuck is going on in this episode?        Just ask them both for double paizuri.   This episode just reiterated the fact that Sento is thick and sexy.    It'll also be free of social retardation.    implying social retardation doesn't make me fully erect       Maximum overlewd.    Everything.     I know Sento likes Kanie but do the fairies?    [Ohys-Raws] Amagi Brilliant Park - 14 OVA (BD 1280x720 x264 AACx3).mp4    Lewd Koboli when   That fucking thigh...     princess Muse   perfect      this fucking episode   KyoAni found a way. This better get a second season eventually. You can tell they had a blast making it.  Also, what was wrong with Muse's head?       slept wrong      we didn't see pic related  I know it's asking for too much, but I feel somewhat cheated.   Is vivid going to sub this?  Is Ashe in this?   I like how Kanye is hitting tirami in the back    MY DICK     couldnt even put up a picture wiwth her in the foreground     But that's lewd anon.    they wouldn't let a man pro-wrestle a woman would they?       you fucking idiot you're supposed to mention the new episode is out    when did kyoani become so lewd   Seriously, Sento is the most lewd character I've seen in years.     not having the fairies tag team avchan and then molest her after putting her in submission   you had one job kyoani        She's the combination of innocence but also lewdness      her voice is also pure sex    Pure heart, lewd body    No Sento in accountant outfit.  you WHAT.       implying ashe would be up for that     Do they combine into Captain Sento?    Her meeting outfit is close enough.    no group saying they're doing subs   Sento Claus would be my choice.   yup, a deadly combination for my heart, she's so incredible it makes me cry   Did they announce season 2 with the OVA?   Nope, just another OVA someday.    PresSento    You son of a bitch.    kek    Anyone?    I think I saw her in it somewhere    mfw they just keep making OVAs season 2 is made up of OVAs     source?  better than nothing I suppose     subs   air     season 2 is made up of OVAs  Sounds like SYD     Not enough ass. The manga was better regarding that. I can't say nothing bad about her Sentos though.    I just. Absolute perfection. Best girl combined with best element.     source?   google.ca       .ca    what is it about Sento that makes her so much more pretty than the other kyoani girls?   The fact that she  doesn't behave like a FUCKING ANNOYING CUNT  is a big plus I reckon    The fact that she always makes this slightly pained and reserved face? She always comes across as someone who is really trying.    There's more to her than just incompetence and/or anger.     her   pure heart     She has  9 pages of Doujins     Kyaa~    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Afx<wbr>itIDRK7c</wbr>  [ ]     I like that they give her a subtle smile instead of a big goofy smile.     pure    she was talking about pornokun    she actually is      ...oh right, I'm supposed to be mad about this.   ...Kyaa~      Subs fucking when   anyone has that muse stitch?   Who is this Sento Demon?   I'd take seasonal OVAs, even inconsistent once/twice a year OVAs over a season 2. Keep the anime alive forever. 5 years down the line I still want there to be amagi OVA being made      blood  THAT'S NOT PG    ¢o    please let her fullfill her wishes    that outfit makes me have dirty thoughts     that navel  I need to hunch over.          Why is it always that most fun shows don't get a second season? I still can't get over Seto no Hanayome and now this.    My dick.   Why was Kanye not in his office helping Latifa out?    fuck I didn't want to fap today goddamn you kyoani      I didn't want to fap today  what is wrong with you    I am amazed by how really close KyoAni copied Nakajima's art into the anime.   what did you expect their almost as godly as Ufotable     pure heart   tried to check porn and also monapis          She was being innocently curious    i know that i am asking for too much, but a pantyhose version would kill my dick       Latfia in a ponytail   Sento with her hair down.   This is what happens when great things are achieved,anons.         Miku Kadowaki is one of Kyoani's best character designer   Was Sento the only one in the Kanyebowl?   I'm curious, where did this, "fairies and navels," thing begin?    I want this callendar.    Kanye is the only other contestant. If he could clone himself but in girl form he would choose his clone.   SENTO U KAISHI    i still have two of them.  interested?     Of course.  How did you get them in the first place?        those butt fangs     tfw S2 never   so in the end who was the worse themepark manager? John Hammond or 50 cent?      give me your @      yeoldfakeacc@gmail.com    Who /watchingitraw/ here?  Meme subs when?    I haven't seen this show why is she crying?      because you haven't seen this show    Her group of friends all end up working together on a professional anime production. They've wanted that since the end of high school.    Thinkin' of dreams.   I'd Sento any Sento at any Sento fucking Sento   Tears of happiness. All 5 friends had finally got to work together on the same project.    ...so salama then?    So this is what it's like when two autist like each other but can't tell the other.     Tough choice between Air and Water, both look so sexy with Sento's looks.    SUBS WHEN? U B S  W H E N ?            I was really hoping for a suffering ending.    <br/>    I'm happy it got a happy ending.    How many times I wonder has this happened because I had no social capabilites.     My boner isn't.      Boners are never happy anon    Not trying to go to much into RL. But I know exactly two times where I found out that the other girl also liked me but I was too autistic to make a move.    how can so much sex be in one picture    i came just by watching this    Probably never if you're ugly.     implying        someone should have probably asked vivid before this came out    this is my fetish     this the best girl   what is this? A slut for ants?     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127174073  yours does not have thighighs    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127174073   Girl's thicker than a bowl of oatmeal.      Wrong.  She's second-best.     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127174073    All of them.    this will never be subbed   you will never actually know what the episode is about unless you watch it raw     I don't think sento would get along with sento or sento     not learning moon    Who Tiramie here?  I miss this show.    learning mongolian for malaysian rotoscope toons     kyoani being kyoani     I want to fuck Nonaka Ai's voice     The result of what happens when Kyoani has a lot of free time    Macaron's daughter will never get animated  Why live   how long till kyoani just goes fuck it and adapts this uncensored   I think they should just go 'fuck it' and make S2 and stop trying for artsy fartsy.    But isn't this a hentai doujin unless I'm mistaken?    it's by the author and illustrationist     That moment when Kyoani starts making hentai     What's the context of this?    Officially canon   Kyoani found a way.  Too bad Hibike is shit.     Why not? Do you steer with your dick?    Because Zuka-chan finally stopped fucking up her auditions and got herself a VA role    Was it for an eroge?     I think they should just go 'fuck it' and make S2 and stop trying for artsy fartsy.  They don't have enough story. Right now there is enough for 6 episodes or so. And there isn't any plot on Chris Tucker yet. The latest book involved the waterpark.     Man, I really need to get around to reading the LN's.   according to nyaa comments DDY is subbing the ova         Kobori didn't make an appearance, did she?      She showed up but I don't think she got any lines.      somehow her midriff feels more erotic than the fairies?    its over  our dicks are finished     I think I know who directed this episode.   Dammit.  Now I'm really wishing for a S2.       Fire Sento  OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOD       Didn't notice that the other Fairies swapped outfits too, will have to dump that is well.    Those are some nice  airbags        I wanted drawfags to draw Sento in the Elementario outfits    mfw KyoAni did it themselves   A way was absolutely found. Too bad they're not all detailed like  but muh dick remains satisfied.          So these outfits are magically made to form fit and not get stretched?   My dick.    I can't tell whose more aroused in that picture       Salama excited that she's wearing Muse's clothing     once again worst girl ruins everything   oh my god        Water Koboldi     You trying to ruse me?    And here's the last thing I'm posting unless something else lewd crops up later in the episode (haven't finished watching it yet) Figured I didn't need to post this one since  is much higher quality art wise, but I felt bad about not completing the set.        Yooooooooo.        Why is it always that most fun shows don't get a second season?   There's a real danger the comedy won't be as funny as the first time.     Salama as Muse   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dOi<wbr>QYt7eqbI</wbr>  [ ]    how is this legal   I can't tell who is who in this picture       Seconds later, I see this. Kyoani finds a way.  You're a bit late to the party m8.              that shop      Salama showing Kobori Muse's erongenous zones   and her favorite spots to lick      Goddess of sex having such tiny nipples.     Jasas chrost.  Those sentos are out of control.  Her hips stretched the shit out of the fairies outfits.      no bully it took me less than 5 minutes    I am Sento, the fairy of semen     How hard would you Sento?   Oh lawd Lawd jesus If there's no season 2, we fucking riot brehs         are we going to need new names       Id rather my waifu.    Tell those Hibikeks you are not flavor of the season Sento.      Who is this dairy fairy?      Can't be.    I want to drink that bath water.     koboli actually displaying cleavage    Will based [Mori] save us?  This is classic Fumoffu of lewdness  pls tell me the clock was still buried under the cicadas  Mori only does specials       ... I think that's moffle    It's the Lucha guy wearing a Moffle outfit.    I'm taking a shit and now I can't take my dick out.  Goddamn.      how?    I was also peeing.    fucking amateur      THE SEMEN FAIRY    She won't be able to walk for a week.       how?        r9k goes on a date.jpg      implying she isn't going to be filled with something else     I would sento any sento.       Oh, shit, Sento, what are you doing?         tfw that discord between Sylphie and Kumiko's voice  how are these the same actress    well of course the voice actress of the worst girl would go onto voice the lead in the show distracting us from true perfection   KyoAni with the top-tier background waifus as usual.    salama   wanting that weirdo autist anywhere near her beloved       you will never inappropriately rub salama's gratuitous cleavage     This makes me curious, does Kyoani ever throw character references to their previous works in their backgrounds?   I would say they are above that, but with their flagrant /u/ and /y/ pandering, I don't know anymore.       /y/ pandering   kaniexmoffle is canon      Do I get that post if I order the bd or its sell in a special store?    They don't. Which is a shame because who wouldn't of loved a good ole game of "Spot the kyoani" character in the background with all the crowd scenes of the park. Too bad they don't own the IP's of there most famous works to make it work.     I'm pretty sure I saw a Dera lookalike in one of the episodes lining up to order lunch.      So hard, that her body would kaching kaching kaching!       I feel like this is a doujin in the making.   Brown haired shota seduces black haired kid's mom   Finds a place for some /ss/   Her son finds them   Brown convinces the mom to let him join in   incestuous /ss/ threesome commences   Then Tiramie out of fucking nowhere   Kicks shotas off mother   LET ME SHOW YOU HOW IT'S DONE-MIE   Proceeds to rape the mother   It seriously writes itself.               On that note about taking a shit and erections, I actually have a problem where if I want to go fap, I actually have a huge sudden urge to take a shit. Is it just me or does anyone else have this problem? Like just now, I was going to go fap to some sento, but yeah, went to take a shit instead.   No, you're just fucking weird.    https://amaburithetranslation.wordp<wbr>ress.com/</wbr>     This happens to me sometimes, but SOMETIMES, not always.     What episode is this screenshot from? We should get this without the text     still in volume 2  why would you do this? Why not start from whatever volume the anime leaves off on? Guess I'll come back 2 years from now.      Because the main arc of the anime ends in Volume 1. The anime pulled in a bunch of parts from the later volumes and extended the deadline of the park to fit them in    Oh, cool. I guess I'll read it after all then.   JUST FUCK ALREADY   Woah, calm down Migi.   Imagine yourself  hugging  Sento     Can't. Whenever I try I wind up imagining myself squeezing her boobs.    They've gone pretty far in the LN    No way, how would I hide my raging boner?     adjusting his tie  How are they allowed to sell this in stores? I'm gonna have a heart attack.     Their spaghetti is too cute.  The series may not be a romance but this is the kind of relationship that would have the best payoff. Hopefully Gatoh delivers just enough for KyoAni and Kadokawa to do a second season.   I fully expect Tiramie and Macaron to buy them a room at the love hotel         Please tell me they confessed, or at least realize they got feelings for each other but are too shy to do anything about it.    They at least realize, but still haven't said it out loud. Gatoh said it won't happen as long as they're co-workers    Oh, my budda.    Only if i try faping before my nooner I schedule all my poops it makes life easy     I feel bad for the guy.     But what will Kanye do that doesnt have to do with the park?    I try not to, my poor heart could only endure as much.    Any Sento is best Sento.     that swedish flag wraper  JUST CUCK MY SHIT UP WITH CHRIS TUCKER    Fuck Sento, post more Tirami   Exactly     it won't happen as long as they're co-workers   All this sexual tension has to give at some point. And I can't wait for it to happen.      nice memes   Salami is so fucking gay for Muse. Also, Latifa a qt.    You'll never inspect Sento's merchandise       just noticed salama has gradient hair    bump   <br/>       Soft?    sauce?   Subs when?           The softest    why is Koboli pulling her skirt down when her normal outfit shows her crotch?   S2 or riot.   RIOT    I think they stole it.  Even if it was, do you really see Kanye digging through those to see if there's something underneath?     I miss my fairies  ;;    This is technically a special    sometime probably     They miss you too, Anon.     someone shop this so they have the yugioh markings please    criminy jim jim I'd plunder that booty like the anchors flew outta me pants     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=h1z<wbr>GqRXZlnY</wbr>  [ ]     Perhaps they'll just have casual sex and kissing sessions while not being a couple    they are perfect    Sento wouldn't mind having sex with the man she loves, but I think she'd settle for  hand-holding.     THEY NEED TO FUCK   Zero no Tsukaima LN Continuation Confirmed  http://www.zero-tsukaima.com/    How would they summon the spirit of the author?   Is the author coming back as a zombie?    BASED A S E D       Is MF Bunko that starved for ideas that they'd steal from the dead? This seems really iffy.  Not even death can stop shitty LNs from being produced it seems.   Tiffa will be fucking killed in your life time   FUCK YES    Reminder than translation never  Finally, besttsun returns!  Really? Who is gonna write that?  Should have just released author notes.   Novels from the hell.    Seems the editors.    Nah, it's the editor find a new author, just still don't know who he/she is.   It was shit but damn it is the definition of a guilty pleasure.  Really want them to have the series crossover with our world so they can travel between them. That would really refresh the series.   Also needs to Jam it Louise. She is craving his dick at this point.       He continues to live through his shit franchise that no one wants to admit to liking.   I could think of far worse fates.    I love ZnT and Louise though    I want to live    They're just finishing it, the last 2 volumes.  Tiffa will die, Louise will get it jammed and other things.     Zero no Tsukaima is a great series and everyone who "ironically" liked it instead of just outright liking it should stop being retarded.   2nd season has a special place in my heart as the final episode made me cry and feeling good.    Louise will get it jammed and other things.  She better. IIRC she is begging for it in LN at this point.        The second season's last episode's last 30 seconds are what made me drop the show. I did read the LNs after though, but all of that development right out the window in the last fucking 20 seconds of the show made me drop it on the spot.     last episode's last 30 seconds are what made me drop the show   Hilarious.     correct me if im wrong, but I only watched the anime. Does this mean that the next season will take place in the real world with louise and Saito? I wouldn't be surprised if their is some shitty excuse for the two to go back, like to fight some magical demon lord. They better not fuck this up, bringing back authors from the dead just for this.  louise is best girl!     I've done the same thing before, for other shows.  Also it's a shame they didn't adapt the war aftermath properly       next season  Anon, the anime was finished and will never get anything else.  this is for the novels.   I do wish we could get a Movie or something to adapt these two volumes, or an OVA or something.          Wait what? This is excellent news. One can only hope the notes left by the author will be enough to make a proper plot and Louise ending.   It'll still make you wonder what the author intended to do towards the end. This is just some random people trying to fit stuff together and make a different route albeit probably acceptable at least    Louise ending.   implying it will not be a Siesta ending      The editor probably knows the author's intentions so it should be fine. On the other hand, he could just say fuck it and tell the new writer to do something completely different.    That's the thing really, it's hard to consider this canon when the original author's six feet under.  My Opinion of course    I wonder how much they'll advertise this.  Would be stupid to just release with barely any advertisement. Maybe an OVA or something.    I SAY YES ZUTTO    病床のヤマグチ先生より完結までのプロットが遺されておりました。   Yamaguchi has finished to make the entire plot.      They're finishing the light novel?! How? And if I remember correctly, there was only a couple volumes left to write but remained unfinished due to the sudden passing. So the story was almost done.    Yes, author notes and editor will finish the novels. They will be releasing the last two volumes based on extensive notes left by the author in case he passed away. Seems like they are going to grant his wish of finishing his series rather than going full idiot and not doing it out of respect for the dead.      It sounds like the author and the family were all for it.    They also make sure to ask his family first.    Well, the last 30 seconds of season 2 is anime original   Saito is 'dead' for months in the LN and Louise tries to kill herself       Wedding version best version    Well let's hope the editor didn't find a lame author.    LNs are way fucking better, and now that they are getting finished the anime ending won't matter. Specially if the LN ends with them fucking like rabbits, Louise getting impregnated and then Saito showing Louise his world, home and family.     Yeah, I read the LNs after so I knew what was "supposed" to happen.  Maybe I'll go back and watch seasons three and four some day, but I really hated elf tits.     Thanks for the spoiler Anon.  No srsly Iam finally going to start reading the LN .    I don't really care if the LN is overall shit or not, I'm just glad the publisher want to respect the dead author by finishing it in his stead.    I watched all of the anime and loved it. S3 is definitely the weakest one but I still enjoyed it a lot.   I started watching anime because of this show.  I swear to God, if that maid cockblocks them AGAIN in the last chapter, I will go to hell and kill yamaguchi myself  That maid really needs to fuck off    Pure joy!  Concrete proof that Japan succeed to summon dead person's soul. They did it just for money. Truly evil... Evil... Absolutely evil...  I wonder how many orphaned children's blood they sacrificed for this depravity?     Bitch, i love the LN and best-tsun.   Last thing I remember from the LN is the mom chasing them down and them saying how fucked they were.   Keep in mind I'm not the biggest fan of this series but I would love to see the story finished. This better fucking end well!!    I think I remember mention of him leaving notes for his death.    Whose mom?    Anime is done, anon. This is only LN's. If they wanted to continue the anime they'd have to do even further original content.   Never forget    Summoning GARcher.   I guess she nailed it.      It's good, anon. You won't regret it.    Reminds me of that one Fate x ZnT fanfiction.   I'm still surprised that ZnT crossover fanfiction is still active until now       Louise's  IIRC there is a novel image of it but I can't remember the volume     I'm glad.   mfw we will never get more of Louise's mom adventures when she was hotter than Louise    I don't blame her. All she wanted was a decent familar and instead she got angsty asshole who wanted to kill his past self even though he knew 99% sure that it wouldnt undo his own shitty existance anyway.  I'd be unhappy too.      Everyone would get fucked from the get go if she had summoned Archer.   http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/?<wbr>title=Zero_no_Tsukaima  WILL WE EVER GET IT TRANSLATED THOUGH?  </wbr>   But there's no high-jump boy in Halkeginia.

What is it about Louise that makes her more likable than the other Rie Tsunderes not including Taiga?   The Era of Rie is long gone   I miss the days of constant bitching about hearing her.        It's not like I want to protect your adorable ass or anything.   I-it's not like I admire your coolness or anything!!!  ZnT: The Tsunderening     More perflat is always welcome   ZnT  I don't remember much about Shana as it didn't leave a lasting impression but I still remember ZnT crystal clear.     Anyone got the epubs/mobie/pdf. The links on BT are all dead.

Best mother   Read the thread Nigger.    It would beb based on author notes so canon.  Also Louise is love.     I wanted to fuck her bad. It would make her less bitchy.   Delicious loli-Karin    She definitely needed a healthy dose of Vitamin "D", stat.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_4Y<wbr>NB7azSBg</wbr>  [ ]   they summoned him as a counter guardian      I love Rie and wish we could usher in a new Rie era.  Also all Ries are love and life though      I don't see it being a tsun end, Louise is basically throwing herself on saito's duck the the previous 5 volumes, of only they weren't cockblocked by meido/elftits     new Rie era.  Well, we had Kagura, Black and Howaito this season.  HnA spinoff is coming soon too, she was in the expelled from paradise movie recently as well. Not good enough, but it's something.         Having to re-read everything again  Just fucking kill me     Gabe Blessing pretty much ensured it would never die after Hill of Swords.     I didn't care for his portrayal of Shirou. May as well have just slapped a fucking OC in there.    So ZnT x Fate is seriously a thing in fanfics?  I guess it ain't that much of a stretch with Summon Familiar.     Don't forget the robot.    Oh shit, you're right.  How did I forget her, she's so good.   The show is fucking atrocious though        Hidan No Aria was an underrated masterpiece.   Yeah I'm kind of blaming it for many edgy interpretation of Shirou in many crossover fics. I like his Louise development in that fic though    Did Lousie's mother ever appear in the anime?     So ZnT x Fate is seriously a thing in fanfics?  No, ZnT x ANYTHING is a thing because of Summon Servant.  Gabe's Fate cross is just what popularized it.       Wholeheartedly agree.  Honestly, it's a shame people don't like it more. Aria is fucking hilarious, cute and sexy.      Catches them making out in the boat    That problem isnt just related to gabe.  99% of Fate fics on FFN can be summed up as in name only and no matter how much they change thing he always has UBW at it's highest showing dispite how many things need to happen to create it.      Which season? Damn, I've forgot almost everything about this series.    2nd     He's dead. Louise a shit and didn't win. Deal with it.      being such an assblasted Siestafaggot     Louise has perfect genes. I hope she remains flat forever though.     I hope she remains flat forever though.  She will anon, she will if we all wish for it.      he doesn't like the worst tsundere ever made!   h-he must be an Xfag!  What are you going to do next, accuse me of being some made up bogeyman?      There's actually some pretty hilarious ones.   Louise starts summoning shit from Warhammer 40k   Louise summons Godzilla   Louise summons the Terminator         Oh man, I've read that the Godzilla one is hilarious.    I'm not that anon, but I'm gonna report you to moot    I think Murasaki Yukiya, Tsukasa, or Akira.    It didn't help that his fic after that was even worse in the portrayal. I didn't even finish it.    Also one of the recent one where she summoned a Gundam. Shame that it's probably under hiatus forever now    There's a guy on there called Neoalfa. His Shirou is the closest to Nasu's I've seen while being decently written.   Who is this perfection?    Louise summons a fucking Jaeger w/ Saito as the co-pilot.  Sadly its a one-shot.     The only non-shit Elf in the whole series   I don't even like Louise but I will admit she is better than the other tsunderes. Light novel better fucking end well.    Louise summons a Geth Platform   "This platform is the Juggernaut, female canine."     There's a guy on there called Neoalfa.  Path of the King is pretty great.          Hasn't updated his Dresden Files fic in 11 months   Gabe is kill       Stops at literally his best fic   Feels bad man.      I remember one with some horrible murica self insert who gassed the people of albion then set up a 'democracy' with only one political party which he was of course in charge of.  I laughed so hard i almost fell off my chair.     Great news, I just received my Louise figure and nendoroid in the mail too,  Thank you kamisama      Hot gue intesifies.     Finally! next one should be MM!, I hope so.    Congrats, looks great    Can't wait for Louise and her magical co in the modern world    A good one I've read had Louise summon Alex Mercer from Prototype, mindfuck and bloodbath ensues. It was a long time ago though, I should probably check for updates.     I couldn't blame him if he did    Wasn't there one where she summons Saitama from OPM?    It remind me that fanfiction were she summon a Necron lord.   She should summon  the EMPRAH    Never read that one, will look it up.     I laughed so hard    I'd love to see the day a ZnT thread doesn't turn into fanfic shit discussion.  Is there any other information other than they will finish the series?    I'll just leave this here  https://forums.spacebattles.com/thr<wbr>eads/zero-no-tsukaima-story-thread-<wbr>index-and-updates.229094/</wbr></wbr>      2016   Japan begins to resurrect LN authors to finish their works   One young and promising author is resurrected after he dies in a car accident but decides to stop writing and live out his life as a regular schoolboy   meets several beautiful girls and totally fails to realise that they want his   autograph  see it's all a set up for just another Shitty LN         Dat ZR using garter and dem details of her small delicious body  I want. That is one good and sexy fig.    New season when?   This. Let best girl win.    Sir, are you aware you have objectively shit taste?      I think you meant to quote a Louisefag.     Necron Lord thinks she's a C'tan   Louise cries herself to sleep thinking she's a world destroying monster         Non shit elf.    also a loli.   Welp that makes perfect sense to me guys.          She has shitty sleepy eyes though.    Jesus fucking Christ, thats a lot of volumes. No wonder the Light Novel outlived the author, holy shit. I want to read this but fuck all that overblown tsun in the earlier volumes, the cockblocking and harem status quo all spread out in 20 volumes and side stories of varied translation status.      Author will never finish the LN    Why live      It's worth it, I hope these news will revive the translation efforts. Specially since there's not much left.   Louise is great but goddamn is Saito an unfaithful cunt.   Pink hair is supreme.      Wants third worst girl to win  Fuck that.      JS06 S 0 6       Will the loli save us?    Not to throw you into despair, but ZnT really, really doesn't seem like it would be up js06's alley.     Louise will never sit on your dick, sliding her tight little vag all the way down on you      Louise summons the Terminator  Holy crackers the fanfics literally predicted Genisys.     But i can still fap to that mental image.      &gt;tfw ended up writing my own shitty summoning fanfic  I know some of you are also guilty of this, don't deny it.      The one where she summons the Skyrim player character is fun.       How many LN volumes did the Anime cover?   All of them, even to the unwritten ending.    You're telling me the new movie has a cute littel tsundere ojousan summon Terminator   Guess I'm reading the LN again.  But man did the 1 vs 70,000 sequence suck in the LN.    N-not exactly, just that the series is a prequel reboot with the T800 sent back in time to protect sarah. You can pretend its Louise with guns.     You can pretend its Louise with guns.  So, Aria?      tfw ended up writing my own shitty summoning fanfic  Haha, what a fucking autist!    I used to write mlp fanfiction and I don't really regret it. I still have a few fans that email me and tell me to write more.          mlp fanfiction  Reported      I don't really regret it.   Straight to the camps with you.        That's some great news.    Herald of the Void was a good read   I know nothing about this series apart from that the glasses girl has some great porn.    Shit taste.    I hated this show so much that I ended up loving it. I'm actually excited it's going to be finished.    Did they manage to gather the dragon balls?   I'm so happy that they're going to finish what he couldn't finish himself. I don't even care it it's shit, just knowing that it's finished will be fine.  Why.  Let it die like the cancer it is    Harem ending please  Where can I find the LNs in Japanese   maybe that actually happened and is part of the reason why EMIYA is such an ass   Why is louise the perfect semon demon?    the author died more than 2 years ago  Fuck, it feels like the sticky was only yesterday.     EVEN IN DEATH HE WRITES      Coming soon to a bookstore near you:  I Was A Light Novel Author Who Died Of A Myocardial Infarction Caused By Deep Vein Thrombosis From Sitting Still For Too Long While Writing My Works, But My Editor Who is Also My Younger Sister Resurrected Me To Finish My Most Popular Series.       Has LN names gotten too long?   I want more about the elves and the onee-sans, I don't really care about the rest of characters.   I feel the opposite.     Pretty soon they're going to stop writing the novels entirely and just sell the covers.     TIFFA GETTING KILLED SOON ALL ELFS GETTING BLOWN TO THE MOON WITH FREEDOM NUKES  BASED LN       They may as fucking well, with all the shit that sells based on it's art alone.     What    They should reboot the whole thing.   Pretty sure it has to be because she was a bitchy comic relief girl in season 1 of the anime, but by season 4, she was this clingy walking doormat that would let Saito fuck the maids just to stay around. Pretty drastic changes.  Also, the sexy pin ups help       mfw 5 seasons of well adapted ZnT   5 seasons of Rie   I only wish this and SnS could get a reboot and have more faithful adaptations        NUKES  Wait what? I haven't read this thing that far yet but what?     I'm just too distrustful to belive they want to respect the wish of the authour, I'd bet they only want to scratch some money and probably such notes he "trustued to his editor" doesn't probably exist at all.  I mean do you people read LN do you really belive these authors have notes about everything is going to happen till the end? If they struggle to end one fucking novel in time do you think they have 2 more plannead ahead?      It's certainly a possibility given how much this guy loved the novels. Also the fact that he could die means he must have left something.    Fire stones are big ass magical nukes if used right.    Are you this clueless?  Js06 translated Color Wars on a mere whim by flipping a coin when asking people on /a/ what LN he should translate next in a thread he made one to two years ago.  Among the LN choices posted, he ended up picking up Color Wars.        That's not too bad. IIRC the author of Guin Saga died leaving the series unfinished as well, so they did the same there. The famous Wheel of Life series was also completed after the author's death.    Most don't under normal circumstances, sure. But the series was supposed to be close to being finished, and the author knew he was dying. Those are the sort of circumstances in which they can set the plot in stone, figure out the key details, maybe write the the scenes they feel the most critical, and then when they die there's enough information on what is supposed to happen, and what happens to who, for any halfway competent author to wrap up the series.   I might have to reread the series again since remember jack shit about it, other than fapping an unhealty ammount to Louise   /a/ suddenly likes ZnT  What happened?    Where's Angela? She's voiced by the Rie and a tsundere, she totally counts.    The LN was ridiculously popular. Think mahouka levels.   Dont forget crazy shit like a crossover with sengoku rance.  Light novel series Zero no Tsukaima will be continued after author Noboru Yamaguchi's death. The last volume released was the 20th out of 22 on February 2011.  Before he passed away, Yamaguchi told his editors the remaining plot and ending and entrusted the series to them on his sickbed. His family also desires to see a continuation along with many requests from the fans.  Source: http://blog.esuteru.com/archives/82<wbr>30152.html</wbr>       The maid has fucked off. She and Louise reached an agreement in the LN. Now Louise just needs to shoo off all the other harem orbitors.    I'm pretty sure it was always fairly liked, not that we don't lik to point out it's numerous flaws or anything, b-baka!     LN getting finished  Fuck year. I never dreamed this would happened. My body is ready.  Louise is mai waifu. Please no touch.        More elves   Also can Overlap do the same thing with Infinite Stratos? I know Yumizuru isn't dead, but the series is pretty much dead in the water with him at the helm and literally anyone pulled off the streets could write better than him. The fucker likes using "ちなみに" too much, it's aggravating to read.      Would there be an improvement in the characters personalities?    Let IS die please     Zero no Tsukaima LN Continuation Confirmed   AH FUCK SHIT NIGGA, BEST NEWS OF THE YEAR      Can we have a lewd tread like in the old times?     Let IS die please  But they are doing so great    I hope this gives us more Louise doujins   This nigga knows what's up      Dude what the fuck.    Great quality in the water part    The LN's already killed it and the anime already butchered the source material and characters. What more do you want?   I want to masturbate by rubbing my penis on the soft inner walls of Louise's vagina   For it to stay dead and for its merchandise to stop clogging shelves    Okay, now they're just getting silly. How long before they start lifting stuff straight out of bond movies?   So i heard that the stupid dog dies and becomes a lich.   Does anyone have that lewd image of louise on a couch with the thumbnail magic?   Who NTRietta here?   No magic though    A shit.    /r/ing Rie the Man and Sugita the Bald photo. You must have seen that one.    FUCK OFF    Lovely    NTR queen is pretty fun though    I remember when Spacebattles went member only traffic because of the huge influx of users. Good times.     the author of Guin Saga died leaving the series unfinished as well  She didn't, the main story was finished, the books she was currently writing were side-stories.    Perfection.  Do you guys think we'll get an OVA or something maybe?     Holy shit the author came back to life?  Does MM! still have a chance?      I think they sealed the casket with that last season. They played the 1st season Op and everything.   I don't understand why you guys want Tiffa dead   Queen &gt; Bar Maid &gt; Tifa &gt; siesta &gt; Blue &gt; red &gt; shit &gt; Pink    Because she's fucking garbage, adds nothing to the series and deserves the worst ending possible. I hope Saito takes a gun and shoots her, leaving her alone to bleed to death    So now I guess we need Tanigawa to die so the Haruhi novels can continue.   Tiffa dies  Doesn't she have time powers or some bullshit? Can't she just ZA WARUDO her way out of a shitty situation?  In any case, it should have been different things summoned instead of stacking Saito and Aqua lad. Woudl have been far more interesting and pushed Tabitha's sister off the deep end.       yfw Togashi's death gives new life to HxH     i wish someone translated the LN    So, this ?    She is literally useless meat at this point.   What do you guys think of the "Dragon god thing" ending of the anime?   The entire ending sequence was hilarious to watch. Ended on a good note in that case.    stupid, worst arc of them all, felt rushed, and the fact Saito stole a fighter jet and flew into the eclipse is all just handwaved away. But god damn would I be hyped for a 5th season.    ZnT continues despite having a fitting end.   MM! will never get any sort of completion.      &gt;ZnT continues despite having a fitting end.  When did the LNs ever have an ending?     I have a boner for military tech  Jet vs mythological creatures was fine for me.      Both MM and ZnT's creators died. ZnT at least had an ending through the anime. MM! got a Christmas episode and no ending.    Yeah, the anime is not the LNs   I can't even exactly remember which part I stopped at for the LN.   How far along am I if Saito got a tank?     And neither will this ending be a true ending, but it doesn't seem to matter to most of you.     Zero no Tsukaima LN Continuation Confirmed  Wasn't the author, you know, well death or something?     Read the thread, both the rest of the development and the ending itself were disclosed to the editor by the author himself before he died.    Japan has finally gathered the seven dragon balls.    That's what they want you to believe. We all know who's behind this...    Please, the notion of there being author notes detailing the rest of the story and ending has been around for a long time.    There's really no proof of that being true though. I mean, it could be true, but the reason the shoved out the last season so quickly was to give the author some final closure, wasn't it? He knew he wasn't going to make it.  I think in the end, it's prudent to ask if this is right.      DFCfags    It's the right thing to do, the guy definitely loved the series enough to want it finished even if he passed away.    I don't know if you can say that. It might not be the right thing to do. They may screw it up. They may ruin the artful story he was trying to craft. We're talking about writing an ending here. This can make or break an entire story and cause horrible problems for the future. How many people do you think remember what JRR Tolkien's son wrote?     This Count?  the same VA, Tsun, and japanese boy      Well, I agree with you that it's a risky thing to do. But I will remain cautiously positive about this.  After all, it's more Louise.      Tread carefully, friend. It might not be the Louise you remember.   it may not be the ideal ending but the fans who stuck with the series and the author (and made him rich) deserve closure. he better have left good notes, he had plenty of time to think about it.    Plenty time to think about it while he was struggling with his own mortality in a hospital bed.   top kek, m8. be autastic somewhere else.      hospital bed paid for with the money his fans made him. he had cancer for 2 years, plenty of time to get his shit together.    Literal autism. I don't think I've ever seen someone so self-entitled. I mean, I can understand if I paid him money for an Alpha of a video game that he made promises to make better, but instead went on vacation every week until he sold it to M$, but this guy was literally dying.     mentioning shitcraft    Louise is mine. All mine.   Nah, she's mine.    are you Saito?     Implying she isn't on my bed right now with a vibrating egg in her   Remote in my hand, therefore I am master.   Aren't we all?        It's almost certain he left notes knowing there was a chance he wasn't going to survive his cancer.    actually it wasn't a japanese boy. the dude was like 17 and was a single father    23 years old with a 10 year old daughter.    wait what?    someone post the pic of that game   I remember Seven Seas was going to release the light novels in English, but cancelled the release after the author's passing. Do you think that this might entice them to release them? I'd love a professionally done translation.     True, but the reason this guy didn't write wasn't because he was a lazy piece of shit like most of them.  He was fucking dying.      Why do so many not get that the panties go on after everything else.      I don't understand the way you think, saying that she's yours, not mine. Sending roses and your silly dreams, it's really just a waste of time, because she's mine.      Fetish literature   That's why you're here.   How can she be so perfect?  You know for someone so small and flat, she sure is one of the sexiest anime characters around  Where does all her naughtiness come from?     Well she's a drawing    Le french   FUCK LOUISE   Mah half nigga.   Louise made me discover that I am slightly M   Cow tits are always worst girl you know.     Not having committed the entire series to memory  Come on anon, step it up       No, not everyone is gay like you. Deal with it.    Her dere part was done perfectly.    I wouldn't want her dead, but she's "useless meat" as people would call her. Just there for more fanservice and nothing else. The story tries quite hard to incorporate her into the story, but fails.  She's nice, cute, and nothing really wrong with her. But she feels kind of forced in, which rubs people the wrong way.      Kind of agree. She seemed like a total bitch in season 1, but it was like people in the studio kept hearing people call her a bitch, and kept toning her back more and more, and more, until by season 4 she was literally dressing up for Saito and blubbering over him if they were apart. Not to mention instead of the typical tsundere thing of blaming Saito for the kiss, she went up to the Queen, her best friend, and bitch slapped her.  She really has come a long ways.          What is character development  Animation studio had nothing to do with it. Author just wrote a complete perma PMS bitch at the start and over the course of each volume she got less and less bitchy and actually embraced her feelings for MC instead of still being a bitch and going "i-it's not like I like you or anything, b-baka!" This is how you do Tsundere. Sure she started really out there but that Dere was fucking worth it.        FIRST KISS kara hajimaru futari no koi no HISTORY  This series forever will have a special place in my heart      Yeah but then turned to trash at the end when both Louise and Saito do frequent complete character swaps and ruin their relationship for the sake of drama.    Although not much can be said about saito who only had marginal character improvement. He is still cruel to Louise by not straight out rejecting the other girls.    They had to deal with the harem thing at some point anyways, better than an open ending at least      Now I really can't die.    That was really annoying.   At first, it was kinda a harem, but when the MC choose a girls, it can't be a harem anymore.      The 'dealing with harem thing' should be resolved by Saito telling the two girls that keep trying to seduce him to fuck off because hes in a relationship. Instead he keeps flirting with them, acting like a dunce who doesn't know what hes doing, and meanwhile Louise becoming an emotional wreck over the whole thing. They made it like that because the last season would be boring as fuck if all they did was sit around and have sex between saving the world scenarios.    Go enjoy your distasteful cow tits somewhere else.    This is what ruins harems for me. Really stupid as fuck blue balling for the sake of maintaining status quo no matter how far fetched it would seem just to keep milking the shit out of the premise. Worse are the fucking MCs which never actually have the balls to go full harem, yet still keep leading the other girls on.      Just imagine the last season if it was like that: saving the world and being all lovey-dovey and shit in their free time. It would had been pretty confy   I wish Henrietta would die. Tristania deserves a better queen.    distasteful   The delusion is real. I'm pretty comfortable here, by the way.       Just moved in together with louise   Sleeps with her AND the maid who clearly wants to fuck him   Lets other DFC girl who is the next regent of Gallia who also wants to fuck him live with them   After a fight with louise, finds a secret chamber, and uses a magic mirror that bring louses best friend, the queen, to him and then proceeds to kiss her.   For a second time.  I'm surprised she stays with such a abusive guy.        But at least in other harems the MC is just a self-insert of the author or just an average looking guy with zero personality so the otakus can self-insert, so i can understand that the MC just doesn't choose any girl.  But in this case, he fucking choose a girl, and we know that he's for real, so it was really shitty      I would have loved it, but apparently the author and the main fanbase cant let go of their masochistic urges even to the grave. It really pissed me off watching each episode of that season but I had to see it through.    She isn't a very competent ruler. She frequently runs away, and easily falls to pressure from internal politics. Abuses her best friend for suicidal missions and then attempts to steal her best friends lover.    A lot of times when writing, you write the beginning and the end, and then fill in the middle.  Not all writing gets done in chronological order.        That was my point, anon. Rarely do MCs actually go full harem. The rest just pick a girl but still keep the fucking status quo    so I'm guessing another season in a year? is this any good anyway?    All was somehow alright before Henrietta though, they even shared the bed with the rest of the harem and the maid is close enough to Louise for it to not be a problem, if Henrietta and Saito weren´t so stupid and stopped with the secrets and sneaking and properly talked with Louise about it, it wouldn´t be so disastrous  Still Saito really needs to decide if he is going for a harem or not already if he doesn´t want to continue hurting Louise being so sketchy with the whole situation       Look at her face, it's pure sex   Louise is a perfect merger of the two  I wonder if they will make some ovas later   What a sexual body on the right one thought the one on the left looks like a shrew.     The best tsundeRie is so good that nobody realizes she's a tsundeRie.     She just needs the dick bad and she will be dere as fuck.   Is Louise more femsub or femdom? Does she get turned into Saito's little pet bitch or what?    cylinder next to the figure of a woman   perfect   She got the worst       Well at least with the maid, louise accepted her because they shared the bed. When saito and louise have been married for a few years I bet louise would finally break down and they would have threesomes.  Half-elf knows she has no chance and doesn't try. Tabitha just wants to sleep with the person she loves before she becomes the queen of gallia, but the NTR queen is really just a bitch. Trying to steal your best friends man is straight up evil.      She switches   Damn it!! I love Kugyus   It really depends. She likes to be a dom but if saito pressures her she instantly switches to sub mode. He made her say all sorts of things.   Push the tip in and she goes full sub-dere     Seems kind of annoying to have to deal with a stupid little girl who thinks she can boss you around, but I keep hearing this series is actually excellent and Louis isn't all that bad. I mean, you're obviously it's fans, but what would you say? Does this series have anything to offer someone who only likes strong women so they can be broken?      Hell not even that, kiss her once and her tsun armor falls apart. Like in that episode in one of the earlier seasons when saito is at her mansion and confesses to her in the boat. She became a moeblob for the next 10 minutes and ignored everything.    INFERNO AUTHOR!    She is not as tsun as the anime, and there is actual relationship building.           Trying to steal your best friends man is straight up evil.  It isn´t quite her intention to steal(though close enough), but she needs to stop thoughtlessly relying so much on her friend´s boyfriend without her consent     Holy fuck yes.    Fapped to day   Can't fap to louise  And my next fap is saturday      not being aroused by louise no matter how much you've fapped   Visit a doctor, /a/non, you might have the gay.      I'd take her flat sister. I'm used to girls like her.    I am very strict with my schedules   anyone here read Midara na Kimi wa Boku no Joou?  . Fuck yeah, I read anything with hairbands with long hair and bangs.    Translations never. Unless it was axed while I wasn't looking.   Is Kintaro Oe from Golden Boy an alpha or a beta?  Both, and neither.   This.   He ends up with everyone wanting his dick, so alpha.   This so hard       Is it even possible for a cuck to be an alpha?     He has ascended to a level beyond.    Kon is beta Kin is alpha and the chick is neither   BENKYOU BENKYOU BENKYOU BENKYOU BENKYOU BENKYOU BENKYOU BENKYOU BENKYOU BENKYOU BENKYOU BENKYOU BENKYOU BENKYOU  A BLACK BRA   He's Vash the Stampede tier. Meaning he doesn't care about that sort of thing. He has a libido but it doesn't come before integrity of character.   I got a job in IT from sitting around on the computer all day and I look to him for inspiration  OH YES  MY QUEEN I LOVE YOU    One of the best dubs.  Is he really alpha?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9eR<wbr>Kj8NG3bI</wbr>  [ ]     The only good dub. Better than bebop.     He is omega, alpha of his own one man pack, living by his own rules, seen as outcast by others until he disides to join in other pack either as alpha or beta.     He's gamma.    Does anyone really think this shit means anything       He is fucking greek alpabet-soup at this point.       so the guy from stratos is also alpha?    Wrong. In Brave New World, it goes alpha, beta, gamma, delta, then epsilon.    He's a masochistic alpha. Kind of like a high-powered CEO who hires dominatrix prostitutes.   We can all agree the dub is better than the original jap voices, right?   both are great, theres no better    Pretty much      kek   alpha pretending to be a beta   NTR is the thinking man's fetish after all    Where did it all go wrong /a/?  why did it turn to piss fetish shit?      mfw reading the manga after watching the   glorious dub   Who was best tan?  Chu-tan.  Paca-tan.  Manga Takeru-tan  Rat did nothing wrong.  Cat did everything wrong.    Dora-tan &gt; Uri-tan = Shima-tan = Shaa-tan &gt; Piyo-tan = Chuu-tan &gt; everyone else.   Nya tan a best.     Who else /tearingupforreal/ now that Etotama is finished?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127167929   still removing any Etos    So, who was the guy on the desert?  Inu-tan.  Chu-tan the White  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127167883  I am Chu-tan?     Scorpio     The desert is Grand Canyon.  It is the Eagle Eto-musume, Freedom-tan      Chu-tan the Lab Rat      It is a mystery.   Chicken breasts  The ones that doesn't have 4 ears.     liking Chu-tan   ever       I'll headbutt you on your back you fucker   There are people in this thread RIGHT NOW (like this fuck over  ) who still thinks Rat a shit    Zoetropes for entire shows now  What next, Zoetropes for shows that haven't even aired?     You're etowaifu a shit.     Zoetropes for Etotama S2    All girls best girl. It's not rat's fault that she ended up that way, even if I hated her at the start but now she's pretty neutral-good.  Manga Takeru is better than Anime Takeru but then we'd have 2 Nyaa-tan types and nothing would get accomplished.    S2 confirmed     またにゃ  Season 2 confirmed !     More like 'She sees sales.png'.    Sheep and Rat    Did somebody post that transparency tutorial that says to use polygon lasso again?    Not Murrica-tan  Pleb.      Shima tan.   Season 2 never ;_; manga translation never ;_;.          She touches your penis          Why the hell did she turn from glorious Black Rat into shitty lab rat?    <br/>    Why the hell did she say her chest felt lighter when her breasts remained the same size?       It's a metaphor anon.   thank you anon in last thread for letting me know there was a special(s)  it was great     Because purity.   Big Fat  Rat  Tats      That's stupid. Sheep have a higher body temperature (38.9˚C (+/- 0.5˚ C)) than rats (35.9-37.5ºC).    I like how they get bigger depending on the frame.    Stop bringing your science into an anime about cute zodiac girls.    Chu-tan was best girl all along  I knew it, cat a shit.    Good thing their etoshin, not animals   Why is your dick so small anon?    vlc     Yeah, goats and sheep have weirdly high body temperatures. Meaning Mei-tan's sheep pussy will be extra hot.  I guess Shaa-tan's would vary between cold and hot, which would be interesting.      I'm kind of limited here.  I'm using Gimp. Hopefully using the Paths tool will work better.      Chickens are even hotter.         Final Verdict.    that bottom border  muh autism     you're etoranking a shit.    Isn't that just her hair?      Yeah, goats and sheep have weirdly high body temperatures. Meaning Mei-tan's sheep pussy will be extra hot.      Rat, boar and ox too high, cock, rabbit and horse too low. B-, please apply yourself.     I can agree with that.    Switch horse and snake then I'll agree.    Boar was the best. Cat and her voice were the worst.    who /dessdess/ here?   I'll des her des.     Rat S-rank   Shaa-tan not S-rank   Kii-tan not S-rank   Holy fucking shit, what an absolute abomination.        Rat for best voice     Monkey S rank  Holy fucking shit, what an absolute abomination.     Chutan The White is wonderful, would marry.    One of the Golden Saint. Greek Zodiac VS Chinese Zodiac.  Lets commit a crime.     All girls besides Usa were best.  Usa was bitchy and I'm sad we never saw the fallout of Shar-tan selling her stock.      Lets commit a crime.  She's over 200 years old. How's that a crime?  All "Desu-wa" characters are like that, that's why I don't really like them.        Blasphemy or heresy, whichever apply to trying to have sex with a messenger of god. Hopefully no one will get turn into salt this time.     How's that a crime?   Blasphemy? Zoophilia?      I like to think her age resets every time she dies and is reborn.   You can't argue with this.   S rank  Tiger Boar Rat Cow   A rank  Horse Cat Rooster Sheep   B rank  Snake Dog Monkey Dragon   C rank  Rabbit                         Tainting something so pure is a crime.       Blasphemy   Well, that's a good point. You can now ignore my post.   Is Zoophilia even a crime?         I'm pretty sure bestiality is illegal.     Who was best tan?   Shima tan      I wanna make her roar.    I can and will.  If you don't appreciate Snake and Monkey, you're a damned fool. Tiger and Boar are correct, but Cow should be A rank, not S. Your other A ranks are fine, though I don't think Sheep is that great, so she's a B for me.  Rat is also B rank; don't be fooled so easily. Rabbit as the only C rank is correct.         Would you milk a rat?   Better a fool with good taste, than not a fool with bad taste.   Rat has been upgraded from A SHIT to A OKAY   I would try.    Except you're a fool with bad taste. Snake is certified best girl, and Monkey has the lewdest design joint with Tiger.      Snake a do nothing shit Monkey a do nothing shit      Yes, I can. <br/>    The -tans I'm going to miss (everyone else can fuck off): Piyo-tan Uri-tan Mo-tan Shima-tan Kii-tan  But especially Shima-tan's thighs. They're a thing of beauty.           Using that basis, Nya-tan would be best girl.    Seriously, just look at them. So meaty. So glorious.    If you're into homely grandmas sure.   Neither snake nor monkey did much of anything.      tiger   Snake at least had an episode to herself Monkey and Dog were just kinda... there. They were side-characters    At least Moo-Tan got remembered sooner it got to the end I thought they completely forgot about her.  Good show, Pretty surprised how it turned out, I assume this must air pretty early in Japan.      grandmas  ...he said, after putting Chu-tan and Mo-tan in S-rank.       Neither snake nor monkey did much of anything.  Shit basis for judging bestness. Damn amateurs.  Also Kii and Inu had more screentime than Dragon, Sheep, and Horse. Maybe more.        The only thing that really bothered me was how Piyo-tan and her perfect adult body transforms into a flat perfect loli body on her pretty mode.  Is like, having 2 in one.     True, but snakes ep was just a recap so it sucked by default.   So at the end, is Mo-tan at normal size in pretty mode?  do they really transform that small? I...I kinda thought they'd be a little bigger than that      this shit taste  Go back to sleep, son.The adults are talking.     No, she saved what would have been a shit episode. Meaning that she's fucking great.      complaining about this   are you impotent       I want to adopt her.    I assume that's just because her soul was nearly completely shattered and it will take some time for to regain her normal size.     Drunk Shima-tan sex.  Claw marks, rawring, that drunk accent.   Them thick thighs to hold you inside.          Horse had an actual episode. A good episode      why complain she literally has a tiny mo-tan riding on her shoulder like a mascot animal character in some shitty shounen anime but better      you will never carry all 12 etoshin on your shoulders and head      complaining about this  Oh no, im not complaining.     in the end, Nya-tan didn't get in the Zoiac   I should have seen it coming. But I can't help but feel cheated.     Concerned cat   My heart.     She certainly did improve it, but it's impossible to save a recap ep from being shit.    Shit basis for judging bestness.  Pot calling the kettle black? Judging bestness by screentime is no better. I'm sure we all agree that nya tan is not best.         Kii-tan and Inu-tan added to the charm of that episode considerably. And Snake had the best moment.  They're great. Accept it.       For a second I thought it was going to get really dark, with Nya-tan joining and Mo-tan staying dead. But of course that would not happen.      Chuu-tan will never scurry around inside your shit an peep out of sleeves/your collar   Damn I miss my rats      show ends   all you geeks do is complain  Good things these threads declined rapidly, you faggots don't deserve any of these girls.     I don't think Kii and Inu are great because of screentime, I was just pointing out a flaw in the "they did nothing" argument, from someone who rated Sheep above Monkey.    mfw that epilogue   mfw they thought they were gonna get an S2   mfw it would've been about Nya-tan travelling the world trying to beat all Eto-Musume      Sheep did more than those two.    Eto-musume were also supposed to have another form: Animal Mode.  We never saw that.      No way. The charm of the show is in all the characters being crammed together, and their stupid antics. They would never do an adventure show.   Not really. Overall, Kii and Inu did more, even if it was stupid shit.         Sheep a shit along with Rabbit.  Snake and Rabbit are best -tans because  they're rich     Rabbit? More like RabBest.    Rabbit a shit and a slut        footfag bait   best anything   It's been an honor, Rabbitfag       One good thing from the series ending is that this lame meme goes with it.   Boar &gt; Cow &gt; Snake = Bird &gt; Cat &gt; Sheep = Tiger = Dragon &gt; Rat = Horse &gt; Monkey = Dog &gt; Rabbit    99% of this thread says rabbit is shit   He keeps posting this.       Horse that low   Monkey that low   Tiger that low  Christ.  The rest is pretty much correct though.        Vita game when    cat, sheep,snake and dragon not at the bottom  Literally ass list.      vita   games      You were already called out.    Actually I'll re-do it. Boar &gt;= Cow &gt; Snake = Bird &gt; Cat = Horse &gt; Monkey = Dog &gt; Sheep = Tiger = Dragon &gt; Rat &gt; Rabbit  I think I'm more satisfied with this one.      What did Rabbit do to get all this hate?  besides the foot-g-spot shit     I'll miss you rabbitposter   My zodiac was really cute.  Are you going to miss your personal zodiac, /a/? I know I will.     Tiger still low   You're still wrong      No you won't.    Cock's pretty form was really cute, but I didn't like her slutty normal outfit or the fact that she was a bitch.    Piyo-tan's pretty mode was the best, and then was Uri-tan's    Hell no, mine's Rat.    You are late.  And you are right. Rabbit a best. A BEST.  I'll miss you, rabbitfag. Constantly waving her flag high even among all the hate.        Is that one anon still doing manga translations?   Tiger is still too low.   She was only mean to cat. And with good reason.       What for? Nobody will remember etotama-threads except for the waifufaggotry.     She was only mean to cat. And with good reason.   and OX and all those other 108 she destroyed      BIG TIGER BUSH    We're talking about rooster not rat.     my mistake. The Eto's are just generally so nice    You can stop arguing now.    adds fuel to the fire   you can stop arguing now       Snake   S   Shit list.  And why all the rabbit hate? I don't think shes the best but she's nowhere near the worst.         so is there a full version of the dance video?     Snake a shit.     Snake is perfect. What's with all the underage in here?       the fact that you can only replay with UNDERAGE is pretty sad, mate     Will probably come with the last BD.     Desu wa   That's the problem here.      Ox and Rooster are perfect  You must be a faggot     Go back to Facebook kiddo.     but I want it now    NYA-TAN A SHIT A SHIT    Aren't they supposed to touch their feet? Then why Dora-tan is only touching her knee?     Ha ha, no thanks.   Because grannys have trouble touching their feet.      Set in stone as of Final ep.   Sexiest Eto  Tiger &gt; Rooster &gt; Rabbit &gt; Rat &gt; Snake &gt; Monkey &gt; Sheep &gt; Cow &gt; Boar &gt; Dog &gt; Horse &gt; Dragon   Cutest Pretty Mode  Rabbit &gt; Rooster &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; GIGANTIC FUCKING POWER GAP &gt; Pig &gt; Sheep &gt; Snake &gt; Tiger &gt; Dog &gt; Horse &gt; Monkey &gt; Cow &gt; Rat &gt; Dragon   Best Character Episode   Cow II &gt; Horse &gt; Tiger/Monkey/Dog &gt; Rat &gt; Sheep &gt; Pig &gt; Rabbit &gt; Rooster &gt; Cow I &gt; Dragon &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shit &gt; Snake    Best Etotama  Tiger &gt; Pig &gt; Dog/Monkey &gt; Dragon &gt; Rooster &gt; Rabbit &gt; Sheep &gt; Cow &gt; Rat &gt; Snake &gt; Horse                no thanks.  No but seriously, keep your shitty facebook pictures out of here. Who the fuck uses facebook for anime maymays unless they're a little shit kid?      The long skirt. If she tried to put her foot up like that, it'd end up being inside the skirt. That would look just silly.   I fixed it. Everyone shut up now.   I think all of them were best  except Piyo and Uma     Rooster's pretty mode is cuter than Rabbits Can't beat them sleeves     Finally a list I can agree with.    oh yeah, forgot  Usa      /argument    Sorry I didn't have a better quality image to insult you with.  And I got it from /a/.      NYA-TAN, REMEMBER THE BASICS OF CQC     S for shit, B for best?     Rabbit pretty mode better than Piyo-tan's  fuck your shit taste     S for shit and B for best right?   S2 of Nyaa-tan and tiny Moo-tan going on adventures around the world when?    from /a/   551766_232714593509569_1826509449_<wbr>n.jpg</wbr>      shit taste   This show was super cute and last episode was great.  Piyo-tan a best      Denial.     This was the BEST pretty mode.  Nobody can argue with that. It just sucks that her battle was pretty bad and boring.       that moment when chu-tan said she was lonely and cried  i liked that the moral of the show was: "be more honest and open about your feelings, saving face is not that important. show all of your facets, act out of character" the animators probably had japanese society in mind      bad   boring   Nigga do you even Shogi  and you call yourself a cock-fag           I just realized that with that size Motan can sleep in Nyatan's sock.     I was tearing up the whole time I don't know if I was happy or sad  hold me /a/non     Alice/White Rabbit fusion was MUCH better than yellow dress and rain boots.  Both are great but Usa-Tan's pretty mode is just that much better.     I want some chicken breast now!   I do shogi, but this Anime was about cute girls fighting not about playing shogi.  If I wanted to see cute girls playing Japanese table games I would just re-watch Saki.       gif      Snake    S   Still shit       is this show any good? I was thinking of picking it up.  can anyone give a quick review? or if you have some of those What I watched images, could you post them here?      I high-key want them to make a S2 in this style.    i will hold both you and chu-tan tight and we all cry and laugh together     show all of your facets  Yeah, no. When I do that I usually want to kill myself afterwards, out of shame.   It's a stupid comedy about cute girls and their retarded antics, with a dash of meta humor, and the best character CG in televised anime.        Do you like fourth wall breaking jokes? No. Nobody does.  Do you like cute girls? Go right ahead. Desudesu a best.         Ask Santa for a keyboard with a functioning shift-key, this Christmas.    chu-tan is love, chu-tan is life    best character CG in televised anime  oh, are nips finally getting it right?   I like Neptune so I guess I'll like this then        No, fuck off.    Cute Chinese Zodiac girls doing cute things. Cat has amnesia and Rat goes batshit, wanting to kill Cat. Meanwhile, Uri-tan goes dess dess.    everyone hates Chu-tan   she cries a bit at the end   everyone likes Chu-tan   Jeez /a/.      ending was too good to be true    I high-key want them to make a S2 in this style.  I think that would cost even more, and they did pretty bad with the sales. So that's a complete No.      Now every post that there isn't uppercase we'll know it's him, anon. Are you happy with yourself?   Well, they solved Mo-tan issue, so all is water under the bridge.       Radio uploads when?     Nobody does.    Mini album 3 when?  did anyone else ITT also watch sengoku collection? i think it was a bit similar to etotama, there was just more time dedicated to the girls. and both shows were actually pretty good, despite most people never gave them a chance or wrote them off quickly.   Never said I thought it was possible. Why the fuck isn't this show selling anyway? If I wasn't a wageslave in college I'd buy it.   I just watched it wait don't tell me... people now like the rat? now finally I can admit that I found her hot as fuck. also its been fun watching this with you guys.        It would cost more to do it in CG   The only expensive thing with CG is all the fucking money you need to pay for the programs but it seems like they're pretty fucking solid in that department.  the time it would take to make a S2 from pure CG alone would be far less than if they animated everything by hand in traditional 2D. The best part is the fact they already have tons of 3D assets to re-use, which is 3D's defining perk against traditional animation.         I watched it, yeah, it was a little similar but it didn't have the "almost absolute no connection" style that Sengoku had, needless to say, both were fun and sales a shit ;_;     I actually still have Sengoku Collection on my hard-drive, and rewatch episodes every now and then.  It's the perfect anime to just re-watch when you're bored.       I did, and you're right. They do have similar vibes. Every single Sengoku Collection episode pretty much followed a specific movie, which I didn't expect at all. That made it surprisingly enjoyable, just like the CG does for Etotama.   On another note, Rat's legs.     episode 23 based off LOTGH   still triggered       My boner noticed.    Speak for yourself, fag.    I want to put my dick between Nya-tan's thighs and rub it against her buruma.    fuck off to reddit newfag    I still dislike Chu-tan.    Oh trust me Anon, we all noticed Rat's legs And those delicious thighs And cats delicious thighs And those school outfits  Give me a minute, I seemed to have spilled some milk and it got everywhere          Can't hate a crying Rat.     OH god, this guy gets it.    You're missing Rat's delicious vagina bones. And Cat's delicious navel peek. And Rat's tail.        Episode 23 was based off the book Dune  the /lit/ inside me cringes but it's /a/, so it can't be helped.        Anon, you're making this harder to clean     Why the fuck isn't this show selling anyway?   Etotama is an almost unknown franchise, and the advertisement for it wasn't that stellar.  Early sales of BDs also means that consumers aren't sure what kind of extras they will get and if some mistakes seen in the TV broadcasting will be fixed for the Blu-ray release. Just like you, many otaku are poorfags who'd rather save up some money.  And most of them won't waste their money only for some few minutes of good CGI when the rest of the show is mediocre or just doesn't fit their taste.        socks  Damn, never noticed Nice touch, moo-tan      This website is for adults only. Try to at least type like one.     No, what bothers me is the fact the anime even referenced Dune in the opening yet LOTGH is on the chart  So whoever made the chart in the first place is a top-class fucking scum sucking idiot.       forgot to tip your fedora, lebbitor    Indeed, Dune should be there, still my favorite episode alongside the 18th one.      expecting the nip noops to read books that aren't light novels   bottom-shelf kek        kek      that's why it's bottom-shelf, anon.    I want to do desdes girl in her butt.   Usa easily.     Dune reference  ya nearly tricked me into watching this      rabbit that high     the race was held in the land of rising sun  Did the chinese hear about this?    dat rat butt    Rat was perfect body wise, now she is perfect every way.     Etotama and Pleiades are over forever.    Pleiades  Glad I picked it up a few days before the finale aired. Unexpected AotS for me. Too bad I didn't watch it as it aired, though; the threads seemed like they were pretty comfy.     the threads seemed like they were pretty po-warm*     AotS  Fucking gross, dude.     Your fucking gross.   The epilogue part was in full CG? If yes then Etotama is truly the future.    Barely any shitposts too.    Best girl by a country mile.    The threads definitely were the most po-warm of the season. And unlike something like Rinne there weren't only 20 people watching.    It was. That 3D Nya-tan was glorious     Can't wait for more of her in a few days.    You missed out. The threads went from best girl discussions to astrophysics explanations to explaining gainax fuckery. Most enjoyable threads of the season by far.    If anything it's taught me to give more shows a chance those first few weeks. Two of my favorites (Etotama and Pleiades) were ones I picked up over a month into the season.    At least it has threads.    She was a maiden in love, cant hate that     what's wrong?     Not who you were replying to, but, yeah, I guess that makes sense. I didn't even know the show existed until the threads started popping up here. Thank god, I almost missed this gem.    This a contest?    You win, I only saw 2 threads of Cocoa while 3 of Usagi.   Beyond me why Usa-tan has become the most hated eto but considering the majority also rank snake insanely high for doing nothing this whole show I'll just chalk it to most of you having awful taste.   Rabbit has a shit, bitchy personality. Snake is funny, and her personality turns me on for reasons I can't fully explain.     Rabbit is a bitch. Snake is cool.     Will she get her ending with Takeru?    Reporting in.   OH RESS!  DAT VOCAL FRY    Chinese Zodiac   Protecting Japan   Speaking English   Lived for thousands of years   Wears a cowgirl outfit  Bravo.           But cat is more of a cunt than Rabbit could ever be.  The most only time we see any real snake humor was during a recap ep where all she did was 4th wall with deadpan humor. Something practically every eto has done in this show anyway      Goddamn that massive cleavage suit of Chuu-tan's. That's literally the looks of a perfect paizuri girl with the perfect ease of access with holdup of the clothes. Would she serve anons if we'd ask politely now that she's back to normal protecting her region and people?      I was hoping she would finally zip it up.    It's the way she says her bullshit completely straight-faced. I love it. I want to marry Shaa-tan.     Fag.    I enjoyed them... I guess I'm nobody.     We had an Usagi thread every single week. There was even one earlier today. You just have to look for it immediately after release.    Are monkey and dog gay for each other?   Will do next week, if there is a next week anyway.    No.    yes    Just very good friends who do everything together.   Where the FUCK is my Etotama fighting game   Yea pretty much.    Fuck.   Cat would be fine for a comic relief side character, but the archetype makes for an annoying MC.   You really haven't been missing much.    I will forever remember Ame-iro has the highest point in the "literally nothing happens" genre.    I want them to be gay for me.    Sure.   Nyaa-tan was utter shite    but the archetype makes for an annoying MC  That's the fucking point.     But she was my favorite Tama next to Mo-tan.     With that said it becomes even more confusing. People hate rabbit for being a bitch even though she's just doing what she can to maximize profit but snake is highly praised despite trolling for no reason other than for her own amusement.      Yes, that's exactly right.     despite  That's where you're misunderstanding.     So they're both what you would call "bitches" but snake gets not only a pass but a ticket to be called best, while rabbit gets shat on and called the worst for being one.  Makes sense     Praise be cow tits.  Burn! My Cosmos!   The diffrence is the Rabbit knew how to make the viewer feel like shit. She could breakdown everything wrong with characters with her experiance as an idol manager. Calling the loved Kenny of the show a shit likely got to a lot of people.  Snake is the kind of bitch where you can laugh at what she does. Rabbit was the kind of bitch that made you feel horrible for doing or enjoying something.  The worst part about it is that Rabbit was always right.  Buy the BDs         LIVE EVENT BD WHEN?   Yes.   They only got 20 or so posts. You can always search the archives and see for yourself.      So Nya-tan and Chu-tan are Mary Sues, but Nya-tan is a bigger Mary Sue. Suddenly the Zodiacs forgot they were useless pieces of shit without Chu-tan and they were pointlessly asking people if they knew the Chinese Zodiac.  Chu-tan kills someone but that's alright because she is one of the two competent eto-shin (the other being Mo-tan).   Chu-tan withheld all her negative emotions and went rogue, yet Piyo-tan can ONLY remember negative feelings and is cursed to do so perennially.   This show was promising as fuck, but as soon as they hit the Snake episode, it went down hill fucking fast.         Well, yeah, that's all true.   But the finale was, ehrm, nice, I guess, and the CGI is also good...   Ah, fuck this shit, Etotama is just about which Etowaifu you'd fuck, so who cares?   Which one's your Etowaifu?           ehrm     That got plenty of threads in the beginning, but the weird pauses between episodes must have confused people as I didn't see any after the first 12 episodes. Could also be my fault for not looking very hard for them.    I already did, it was just like I was expecting.    Cat is a shitty etowaifu. She's below shit.     The show certainly had its moments, but jumped the shark when it became a POWER OF FRIENDSHIP mess.  I want to   cuddle with   Chu-tan      jumped the shark  But they literally did that at Horse episode    Not a bad show but if feel like they wasted a lot of Shima's and Dora's potential, and too much screentime wasted on the lolis and perv.  This couple is the only think I'm going to remember about the show, Uma also won some points with only 1 ep.   Someone post the shima flakes pic pls        Shima is a golden tiger goddess.       screentime wasted   on lolis      So that anon doesn't like loli-waifus. What are you gonna do about it?   Why did this anime get such a good ending and Show by Rock had such a shitty one?   Are you just waiting for someone to call you out on your use of the word 'waifu'? You're forcing it pretty hard.     Not him but liking lolis didn't make me instantly like Kii and Inu-tan. They were alright and get some points for being lolis but they're not favorites, that's for sure.    Inu and kii didn't do too much.   That couldn't be more generic, it was like the ending of an anime for little girls.        You're forcing it pretty hard.  And?     I'm not going to say what you want me to say.    That's good.      Only Uri-tan is a loli. And she also happens to be the best. Who other do you think somehow applies? Maybe Nya-tan, but that's cutting it close.         Kii-tan   loli  She has the height of an average adult woman, and B-cups are also not so rare on women.       nice image fag    apictureforants.jpg   Boar is best!  What a great ending to a great show. Is Nya-tan Jin Freecs?   Understand that the Rabbit hate base is full retarded and has been for a long time.  As you said, they hate Rabbit for being a bitch. ...Even though Cat is a significantly bigger one and an irresponsible shit. They at the same time love Snake FOR being a bitch.  They call out rabbit for being footfag bait. ...Even though Cow is an actual footfag.  They call out rabbit as a slut. ....Even though Sheep is the one who constantly lusts and fantasizes for hot dickings and Cow can't stop thinking about getting pussy.  Rabbit is best. Make no mistake.               Yes anon, every traveler with a cloak is jin freecs.    Glad you see it my way, the true way.    It's funny that rabbit fags actually believe this.    I want to  travel  with that smile.     I know you are but what am I?  Sasuga bunnyfags.     And it's hilarious that it's actually all true.    Somebody needs to make a webm of that scene.    maybe in midget countries. average for women here is 170cm.    Does anyone know where I can buy a Nya-tan?     Snake   bitch   She's the most compassionate Eto-shin together with Mei-tan.       That's just a lie. And who the fuck cares about midget countries, we are talking about Japan, where the average height of a young adult woman is 158cm, which is exactly Kii-tan's height.     But Snake is loved here for her deadpan trolling.    There is that, but I like her motherly nature too, even if it would be uncomfortable at times.  She makes good curry as well.     You can buy I &lt;3 Nya-tan shirts in Japan. There's tons of them, because nobody wants them.    Japan is a fucking midget country. Now you should stop lying.    If by true you mean false, then yes it's all true.  "Lusting" after only 1 person doesn't make you a slut.  Rabbit cums just from having her foot touched.  And how is snake a bitch? We haven't been given a reason to hate her deadpan humor.  And why didn't you mention dog?           Just go outside and look for a cardboard box. I'm sure someone is trying to get rid of one.    Lying about what? And who cares about your shitty country? We take the country they are from as a standard, so Kii-tan is at full adult height; this is just a fact.     They are fucking gods. They're not japanese.    Rabbit doesn't lust after anyone at all though and she's still called a slut.  Rabbit doesn't make anyone touch her feet to get off, They either do it on thier own accord or on accident if she did force people then yeah, you'd be right but she doesn't.  Snake fucks and trolls with others for her own amusement. Obvious bitchery but that's ok because "yeah".  didn't mention dog because I thought it would be too obvious. Same reason I didn't call sheep cock hungry         Snake didnt 'fuck' with anyone to cause harm. Unlike Rabbit that bitches at others making them feel bad. You are biased and retarded.    Are you seriously trying to argue that rabbit is better than anyone Even Rat managed to redeem herself more     No, they are chinese and I don't think they are any taller over there.    Rabbitfags   not the worst posters in these threads  Fucking Ratfags before this episode were better than you.     They're not humans. They don't have a nationality.     wasted potential   no Shaa-tan   A fucking recap episode. First time in a while I saw a character so screwed over       She's still top tier.    Rabbit needed no redemption though. mostly because she was already a solid best.   Most times Rabbit was a "bitch" she was trying to improve her own peers. Rabbit talks the shit you need to hear even if you don't want to hear it. Snake just fucks with you.    Anti-Rabbitfags   Being retarded  Pick two             Rabbit talks the shit you need to hear even if you don't want to hear it. Snake just fucks with you.  So Rabbit's a cunt and Snake's a bro? Glad to hear we're in agreement      That CG.    We will still compare them to japanese sizes, because this is a fucking anime so that 158cm implies the adult height you prick. She was never intended to be a loli.      Someone telling you ways you can better yourself makes you a cunt.   No wonder the majority of /a/ is doomed to loneliness.       that model  So it doesn't have to look like shit in full size.     Is this the future of low-budget shows? I accept it.    No, being a cunt makes you a cunt Rabbit was a complete and utter cunt This oughtn't be difficult logic to grasp      Are you going to call us all virgins next?  Rabbitfags truly are the cancer.       ways you can better yourself   from a jew     I thought we could have a sad but comfy thread to mark the end of something I've been following and loving these past few months.  Nope, waifu wars     It's the reason you think she's a cunt that's difficult to grasp.    Chinese Zodiac   Jew  Reach harder. Maybe you'll touch the stars         the rabbitfag started it    Yes and now we have Mr. cuck and Ms. cunt trying to shit on the last thread.     Yea gotta hand it to the rabbitfag, he really knows how to ruin things.     But anon, the ending of Etotama was extra comfy. We don't need to be comfy about it, since it was actually a satisfying ending. Waifu wars are always present, and was present in most threads that weren't episode discussion threads. And I think with even Chu-tan becoming likeable at the end, there's no reason to take insults seriously.        School ended last week, you should have expected this.    Is rabbitfag the same person that kept defending that cunt All A from Yuushibu? I haven't seen such a stubborn defense of a mediocre character since then. You both sound very similar.     If you read up there were tier lists arguments long before I even popped into this thread.  But keep pretending i'm at any fault Anti-Rabbitfags are truly the most retarded.        Just like rabbit in the show.     All A  Which one is All A again?     What did you expect? Etotama threads went to shit halfway through the season.    You're right, there were tier lists long before you even popped into this thread My point still stands     That's not even smug you stupid kid. Kill yourself.     The flat-chested blonde tsundere.     My point still stands  That I started something that was already here in this thread?     You're right. Why can't we go back to those first few threads where we  talked about all the different diseases we would get from fucking the Etos     Because too many people called it AOTS and attracted shitposters. If they weren't here we could all go back to peacefully  blogging about our zodiacs.     I'd hate to say this, but LRD is right.  What kind of STD's would Tiger have?      Yes, then rat started beating her face in. What a fuckin cunt.    Well, rat certainly gave me diabetes.    I remember someone actually posted a disease that only Tigers have  Forgot its name, I think it was an OP       that adult body   those emotions  She really is best girl, Nya-tan just fucked up trying to make her better.      and the way they fuck?   In which show is Chiyo going to work next?  Anyone make any webms when mini-mo was on Nya's shoulder?    Yea because those threads were so much better.     If nothing else I appreciate you coming to usa-tan's support.  She is my  4th  favorite and all this hate for her is insane.      Her breakdown reminded me of Kongou's.  They were both the big bad bullies in their shows who really just wanted friends by their side.      I prefer animals trivia.    That bounce    It's the pepper.    Who's wearing the  black cloak ?  Death-tan ?     CARNIVAL DA YO      One of the vengeful Eto-musume tormented and defeated by Chu-tan in this season, Eagle-tan. Nya-tan in Season 2 is on a quest to subdue the other 107 angry Eto-musume, other Eto-shins also aid Nya-tan.    ;_____________________________;       All those bouncy rat tats this episode. I need to look for some pretty mode lewd.    Just getting it all out in the open before we all forget about this show and it fades into obscurity, mentioned only once in a blue moon.  It was a fun ride.      watching Aria   just noticed Chu-tan's VA voices Alicia   mfw      Mai schweet honey     cow didn't stay dead   The only travesty in this entire show.        The only travesty in this entire show.   Not wanting a literal tiny mo-tan       Her voice made Rat infinitely more bearable, especially during the breakdown this episode.   This was a stupid theory, but you kept posting it week after week. I just wanted you to know that you were wrong, anon.   No worries, I still believe in Death-tan  Whether it be from the manga or the hypothetical S2     Not a single one of you fuckers said Shar-tan.  Did this show turn anyone's expectations for 3DCGI anime completely? That epilogue is an amazing look at how anime van make that 3D leap and retain that 2D style. I'm excited for the future now.   All tans are best tans, except Nya, she was a shit for 11 1/2 half episodes    Dora-tan   Nya-tan a best  I just realized that having Rabbit's feet be her androgynous spot wasn't just them choosing a random body part     It's not like people were arguing about whether she's the best for most of the thread.

Natsumi, Yoshino and MIku fucking lesbians  No. Fuck off. Only Miku is a filthy lesbofag.     Literally 0 of those things are true     Thoka not a retard   Nigga what?       Flatori best imouto  Stay delusional, faget.     3 threads without the Houkifag shitposting.   Holy fuck, man.  DAL threads are finally saved!      Don't be tricked so easily  Try and think of one character that hasn't raped Tohka  I can't      Natsumi is gayer than Miku. And Yoshino is okay with it.     Mana     Flatori best imouto  Nothing to disagree about. Shidou already agreed, don't bother him about it.      But this entire volume was everyone raping Shidou.     The only rapey thing involving Tohka is her raping shido's mouth     I want to fuck the shit out of Kotori and make her my wife.     Get in line.    Why does she wear panties under her pajama?    Who doesn't?     I don't     - Shidou coughed. He remembered the promise with Tohka. After he captured Yoshino, Tohka said "don't kiss with anyone else but me" to him. Shidou keep quiet about it since he can't make Spirits become emotionally unstable.  - Shidou tried making an excuse. But Tohka said sorry that she made a contradict condition to him. She asked Shidou to save Spirits, yet disallow the method to do that. - However, Tohka then continued that he should have told her back then. She thought Shidou have other ways of sealing Spirit Power for all along.  - Shidou said sorry to her and lowered his head. Tohka shook her head once again and tell him she forgive him, but with a condition. Shidou widen his eyes because Tohka, while knitting her brows at the pain, climbed down from her bed and climbed up into his bed.   "Er, Tohka?" "I don't have any complains. But since Shidou violated our promise, —"  - Tohka counted off her fingers while calling the Spirit's name. Yoshino, Kaguya, Yuzuru, Miku, Natsumi, Origami. Tohka blushed and say in small voice,  "…Seven. That's the number of times you kept secret from me. I'll forgive you this time with seven kisses." "Wha…? H-hey, wait, Tohka!?" "No questions. Or you don't want to kiss with me?" "No, that's not what I meant, others are —" "Then there's no problem! Sit still. I'll be done fast." "W-Wait!"  - Tohka covered up him and pushed her lips toward Shidou's lips. Shidou feel a pleasure like his brain is burning up.  "N…chu…" "…! …!!"  - That moment,                          "Sorry to keep you waiting, Shidou. I've brought everyo —"  - The door opened. Kotori froze in front of it. Tohka widen her eyes in surprise and separate her lips away from his. Shidou's lips got pulled with her lips a little before it bounced back.  - Their lips are connected to each other with glittering thread made of saliva. With that scene, Kotori and the Spirits, and Mana rushed into the room.  "W-wait, what were you doing in this short timespan, Shidou!?" "U-um… you both just recovered, I think you…" "Ka, kaka… Tohka sure takes the cake." "Pointing out. Kaguya seems frustrated." "Kyaa! Eh? I didn't saw it properly, so could you do it again! Again please!" "UAW… you just woke up and did that… how gross." "…As expected, I can't be off guard." "Nii-sama! What are you doing!?"  - Everyone said that and surrounded Shidou's bed.  "H-hey, everyone calm down. I…"  - Shidou tried smoothing it over. However, he couldn't came up with any excuse.   "Muu…"  - Tohka is also the same. Since it came to this, Tohka then hugged Shidou. The Spirits raise up their voices "Ahh!".   "Haha…"  - In the tumult that Shidou felt it has been a long time since he heard it, he patted Tohka head while smiling bitterly.   [End]                               I WANT TO FUCK KOTORI!    this blatant favoritism     Based Tohka!    SEVEN  KISS     SUMMARY ANON WE LOVE YOU THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.   Remember Kaguya a cutie    Tohka being sly, that was great.  Also, thanks summary anon. You're too good to us. Get some sleep.

Their lips are connected to each other with glittering thread made of saliva  Lewd. Thanks so much based summary anon    ku ku ku thank you summary anon   Tohka wins a flawless victory. Don't worry Origami, you can still be second.    Greedy retard, seriously I doubt this series will have a harem end.    Well I can't really be mad since she's got the guts to take the initiative. Night! Thanks    It will.   as long as bwaka gets her kisses      Tohka a greedy girl. Shidou belongs to everyone.    Thanks a lot, you're the real hero    Unless we  kill the Tohka.     S2 BDs never, did FFF drop it or is anyone else doing them?    and people say there is no favoritism in this novel.    Postword  - This is the first book since Tachibana's debut with a male character on the cover (total of over 20 volumes!). - The spread illustration this time is 'that thing'. If you don't know what it is, then open volume 1 page 131 (chapter 2). What a long foreshadow. Was it even a foreshadow? - New series "Itsuka Sekai wo Sukuu Tame ni -Qualidea Code-" will be released on August 18th. Illustrated by Haimura Kiyotaka. In a world that has been evaded by an enemy of grotesque looks, boys and girls are fighting to protect their country… but those boys and girl don't really care about the world being in danger or whatsoever. They just pour their love into a certain girl. It's like Origami being split into several characters. What is that how scary.  - Dragon Age 2015/09 will have Date A Live Marugoto BOOK that complies all articles from Dragon Magazine with few Tsunako illustrations that never been recollected anywhere before. - PSV Date A Live Twin Edition Rio Reincarnation out August 30. - Date A Live SS1 BDBOX coming out on August 31 with additional scenes. - Date A Live Mayuri Judgement screen August 22.  - See you again in DAL13 or Itsuka Sekai wo Sukuu Tame ni -Qualidea Code-.  - Tachibana will still continue writing DAL so don't worry.    Bed time. It was fun guys.  mfw back from Japan on August 19th   mfw movie will be screened on 22nd                     What a greedy slut  she needs a spanking from Reine     Not since volume 2.   You are the best summary anon! Thanks!   And she's even more dangerous now that she knows she loves him.   Night! Thanks       Thanks for this. http://pastebin.com/Kcm2PsAm      good to know Tachibana hasn't given up     I am, and I'm up first.    Thanks anon.    Thank you summary anon!   Movie thread next?   Thks for all your hard work, great summary Good night     Yes she is.   So now that we this  What was everyone's general thoughts of the volume?    She deserves more kisses anyway. Its only fair since he lied to her!    No she was just being retarded   Previous thread: <br/>    Two of them are from Alice now, and Souma is obviously for Erina.    Megumi is les bait for some reason. Even if they aren't really lesbians.    I honestly hope that Megumi looks like this in the end of the series    Nah, Houjou x  Souma .    Have a link, anon?   Too-too-roo!   If there is one thing the dub did good with, it was the sound editing. The Japanese mixing sounds as if the actors were too close to the microphone when recording.    I just finished the VN yesterday, haven't seen the anime, but I'm kind of disappointed. I distinctly remember this scene because Okabe's line is probably the best English we hear from any of the characters, despite the fact that it's supposed to bad. http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=H2TU<wbr>Qs9BB9w&amp;t=15m35s</wbr>  [ ]     That's because he's not. In terms of quality dubs, Steins;Gate qualifies. You probably think all dubs are bad, huh?    Isn't this what fucked him over in the Suzuha route where he kept time leaping those 2 days over and over again till he was driven to mental exhaustion.    Dubs are not anime.   Next week: Back to the swirly-haired pirates!    They did know about him.  It is just because he has his noble rights and can't do shit to him.      So do you think Cavendish has a crew or did he kill them all as Hakuba? Would Zoro have a field day having Hakuba on board like "Hell yeah come at me, you bastard! I'ma cut you!"  Not assuming Cabbage would join the Strawhats. Just Zoro actually meeting Hakuba.      ~10 pages per episode   tfw One Piece Kai is 10 years out minimum      I'm pretty sure Zoro and Hakuba will have a fight. Zoro will win. Shiryu will fight Mihawk. He'll win. Zoro vs Shiryu. Zoro wins.  Zoro is the best swordsman at the end of the manga.    Best panels?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PGi<wbr>yDw3dOSs</wbr>  [ ]  Boruto  - Rasengan and Rasenshuriken - Chidori and other lightning based jutsu - Rasengan/Chidori Mix - Multi Shadow Clone - Snake Summoning - Snake based Jutsu like the shed skin - Toad Summoning - Sage Mode  Sarada   <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127178584#p127178584">Click here</a> to view the full text.

If you try to tell me Boruto is anywhere near Naruto's shoes I'll just kill myself.  Like I said, he could manage to do that, he can't do 1000 clones like you said so. That's the entire point.  If Naruto wanted to he can make 1000 Lightning clones with his huge ammount of chakra(he has all chakra elements), but not Boruto.         people are taking about further down the road boruto not current boruto, thought that was apparent. ofcourse he isint going to be able to use a lot of clone like that as a kid, but naruto could make like a 100 shadow clones as a kid and bolts is a prodigy he should be able to do more/double that.     Fuck outta here nerd, a shadow clone is a shadow clone, and the clone took care of business with witnesses. End of story.  Could Boruto get a form to equal up with Naruto's EoS insanity? Possibly, motherfucker. We're talking literal aliens are the bad guys now, there is no rhyme or reason for you to set a ceiling to what could happen.   Boruto being a chakra monster is not a stretch.          fire and lightning    As a person grows the amount of chakra they can retain increases, right?  If Bort's already pulling off shadow clones like they're nothing and can into both Rasengan and Chidori, it's not difficult to say he's going to be a monster as an adult.   Salad too I guess.    </blockquote>]
