She looks like an alien to me with the huge head.</br>  <br>Maybe it's the forehead, because the actual head size itself looks fine to me</br>  <br>Honestly, neither Shiki nor Shirou's new hairstyles look a lot like his old style. <br><br>It looks a lot fluffier and full of volume unlike Shiki's old straight hair with a bit of bangs. See </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's mainly the upper part of her head. It looks unnaturally large to me.</br>  <br>Different guy. I don't have a problem with most of the CG, but the one on the top left is wonky as fuck.</br>  <br>Len's the perv. Shiki was pretty much paralyzed and Len used his dick to get off.</br>  <br>This. She needs that dork ass center part.</br>  <br> look a lot like his old style. <br>It is literally just a copy of the old Melty Blood brush the hair back to look cool hairstyle that both Shikis had. It's even on the bottom part of that page.</br></br>   Len used his dick to get off. <br>That's pretty fucking lewd of Len</br>  <br><br> ITT: hurrrrrr </br></br>  <br> all these people saying they hate the new designs <br> vn comes out <br> everybody gets it, plays it and loves it, /a/ is filled with threads for days <br> 2 weeks later everybody suddenly hates everything again, especially the style <br><br>don't even pretend this isn't true.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>NOT ANIME OR MANGA<br>KINDLY FUCK OFF ALREADY WITH THIS GENERALS.</br></br>  <br>Tsukihime (Japanese: 月姫?, lit. "Lunar Princess") is a Japanese adult dōjin visual novel created by Type-Moon, who first released it at the Winter Comiket in December 2000.

Besides, wasn't she supposed to personally dislike red?</br>  <br>What the fuck is even going on with BL anymore? Were they always such insular cunts?</br>  <br> wasn't she supposed to personally dislike red? <br><br>People always bring this up, yet nearly ALL of her outfits are mostly red, including pic related and her kimono in KT.</br></br></br>  <br>Shiki looks fine, i'd prefer him looking more like Mikiya than Shirou but well..<br><br><br>Arihiko will probably get more relevance since they're making the Remake longer and adding stuff.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hey, commies, I will finish Mahoyo translation alone. <br> We'll give you nothing. It's our own secret project. Start from beginning. <br> B-but 67.99%... <br> No. <br>MUH TRANSLATION</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Come to think of it. Arihiko is pretty much the only character that has actually improved. Huh.</br>  <br>This feels like a similar case of Ciel having black hair to me, to be honest. As much of a classic Turkeyhandle is, it was filled with small contradictions like that. I'm looking forward to see if the remake will touch upon her clothing choices and color preferences, as well as any other different outfits they may have for Akiha  against my better judgment, because NEVER EVER </br>  I don't know why people are complaining.<br><br>Shiki looks exactly like Shiki did in Melty Blood but with a longer ahoge. <br><br>People saying this design is similar to Shirou are idiots. Shirou's original design was a ginger butch bulldyke with a crewcut and really short hair. They copied Shiki's MB hair for the newer games.</br></br></br></br>  <br>One thing I don't miss about fansubbing are the egos. Quickshit subs might not have all my choices but at least they release with no bullshit about translation rights and attention whoring.</br>  <br>mfw i cant find the character portraits used in that april fools game</br>  <br>wait I found the better one<br>i have never touched anything by commie since. my jimmies will never recover</br></br>  <br>watcha looking for anon<br>I have all of them saved, I will never forget the joys of a better time</br></br>  <br>I think miyabro, or something like that, saved all the assets of the game.</br>  <br>It's on the Panda.</br>  <br> fluffier hair <br> circular irises <br> eyes lower/forehead larger <br> flatter nose <br> thicker, trendier glasses </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why can't it be 2013 again?

It's a great series, with a story and characterization that is very well done in most aspects, and which bolsters its strengths with great character development and a dark, complicated plot. Your average anon, hopefully, is intelligent enough to see this as the masterpiece it is, and may enjoy it, hate it or be indifferent to it, but all the while recognizing that the series itself, regardless of their opinion, is very well thought out and deserves recognition and respect.<br><br>These very aspects that make the anime so deep and mature make it a discussion ground for scholarly gentlemen who engage in every kind of both online and in the real world. The hard-working characters who continue to stand against all odds, the realistic jutsus and well-designed clothes, the whole and everything about the complex Naruto world provides fuel for much thought, and the deep character backgrounds, their dark past and emphasis on revenge, and overall greatness of the series make it fit just right with the refined taste of your average intellectual and his sense of disappointment towards the world’s dull, un-thought provoking choices in entertainment. Exactly the kind of material that brings the intelligent and well-educated together over critical discussion.<br><br>Naruto is basically THE series to attract the highest-tier fanbase known to /a/, which is why, regardless of individual opinions, it is the responsibility of every anon to support the existence of threads discussing the subject, and make sure to give a friendly bump to all Naruto threads to make sure /a/’s elite continue to show their faces here.</br></br></br></br>    if u don't like it, hide the thread and f*ck off!  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127459441   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=yHM<wbr>RRmpI2xo</wbr>  [ ]  Victory shall be mine.

We spent 10 whole fucking chapters just to watch her decide she wants to become Hokage, which could have been done in 3 chapters with no drama.<br><br>There's nothing to her character anymore besides being a Sakura clone who looks like Sasuke and this whole Gaiden was really just about Sasuke.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> You say newfriend but i don't really know who are you quoting newfag. <br>  i don't really know who  <br>  i <br><br>That's because you are a newfag.<br> Stay mad newfag-kun. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They got lucky by never having to play the Clippers or Spurs</br>  Nuruto was a mistake  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nFw<wbr>nfFsAr3Q</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Who are you quoting?</br>  Who /Knicks/ here?  <br> Unless you posted like a /b/tard,  <br><br>I did, but the mod doesn't actually care about /b/ shit since he's probably one of the shitposters in this thread.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I really feel sorry for you.<br><br>Check'em.</br></br></br></br>  Come out swaglord  <br>She's dead to me</br>  <br>Meanwhile AZ threads are tumblr 2.0 tier and Jojo threads are reddit tier but barely anybody give a fuck.<br><br>Sorry man, the fact that Naruto is the one that's being fixated on kind speaks more about /a/ as a whole rather than the so-called Narutards. Yes, there was a time when Naruto fans were the worst thing to set its foot on /a/. But that was also a time when hating on Gaia was still a thing.<br><br>But things have changed a lot now. There are way worse shit on /a/ that deserves the hate. Naruto is small time these days if you just let the Narutards keep to one thread to themselves. If anything, Jojo and AZ are probably more responsible for crossboarding cancer than Naruto is these days.</br></br></br></br></br>  If you don't like Naruto then just leave us alone and fuck off.<br>Nobody is forcing you to stay.</br>  <br> newfags Narutards get this ass blasted <br><br>Naruto threads always dubs spammed to death. The mods gave you a chance after the ending and you didn't take it.<br><br> all this obvious /v/ garbage <br> 3DPD and not anime image every threads <br> CUCK CUCK CUCK <br> Narutoforum <br> tumblr <br><br>You only have yourself yo blame filthy crossboarder.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Naruto was a mistake  <br>For you.</br>  <br>Did someone actually type out this monstrosity of a copypasta?</br>    <br>You mean those Clippers that choked away a 3-1 lead against Houston? You mean those Spurs that lost against said chokers and got nearly taken to seven games when facing the same Warriors core with injured Curry and Lee in 2013?</br>  <br>That's the hardest I've laughed at a le meme comic<br><br>Narutards are truly comedy gold</br></br></br>  The fanbase is angry, retarded and gay, all Narutards have low power level most of them have watched probably less than 7 series like Dragon ball or bleach, most narutards are normalfags (don't have waifus, fetishes, etc), everyone who's seen at least one narutard knows they are 4chan's biggest enemy and cancer, they use words like moeshit, loldeep, they are underage, they can't have an intelligent discussion with other anons, all they do is say "umad", "naruto is great, have u read naruto?" "but why do u hate it?", they SPAM multiple naruto threads at the same time, etc, etc, etc.<br><br>Naruto faggots openly admit to shitting up the rest of the board. They randomly blame arbitrary shows for their own problems. Shit like the accelerator spam happened because Naruto faggots are infesting the board. If we let these dumb underage faggots run wild in this place, they will bring more retarded underage faggots with them to /a/.<br><br>There are many threads about bad shows on /a/, and I don't mind. But when it comes to Naruto, I DO mind. This fanbase is the worst fanbase of them all. They really are. You want to know why? Because grass grows, birds fly, sun shines, and you're a fucking headband-wearing faggot with too few braincells.</br></br></br></br>  <br> We spent 10 whole fucking chapters just to watch her decide she wants to become Hokage <br><br>Still have no idea why she suddenly wants to become hokage. Guess the last chapter will explain this. In any event, nothing happened that made me dislike the character. She has grown by learning and important lesson and her troubled relationship with the Sauce is still intriguing me. <br><br>In any event, we knew that this would be over pretty soo, so we couldn't expect much more. Salad cannot have issues which must be dealt with in a long arc because there is not enough time for that. <br><br> being a Sakura clone <br><br>Except for using her catchphrase, Salad acts nothing like Sakura.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If you don't know how /a/ really was and you are knowing now and you don't like it, then just leave us alone and fuck off.<br>Nobody is forcing you to stay.<br><br><br> &gt;&gt;/M/AL <br><br><br> Also Check'em. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>They were much better matchups for the Warriors than the fucking Grizzlies and Rockets</br>  Nuruto was a mitsake  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nmP<wbr>PCkF6-fk</wbr>  [ ]  The autism from the narutards and spammers is mind-numbing, you should both fuck off.  <br>Well, we don't know that much.<br><br>All we know is that whatever mods give half a damn about Naruto, whether they like or dislike it or even just have awareness about it, they think that complete and total shitposting is vastly preferable to normal discussion.<br><br>There seems to be one or two mods or janitors that slightly give a shit about this board and will delete spam/send out warnings, but they obviously don't care that much.<br><br>Frankly, I can't blame them. It's a lot of work cleaning up these messes in favor of greater concerns, and Naruto isn't a well-liked series here. It's lame and shitty, but meh.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hey guys can I get some dubs?    <br><br>It's funny because almost nobody in the Naruto threads really even enjoys Naruto anyway. Present "Narutards" are little more than masochists who set up threads to see just how terrible things are gonna get with the next addition to the series. There was a little hope in that the Gaiden seemed to be taking a new and bold direction, but that's been shot to pieces.</br></br>  <br><br>This.<br><br> 44 <br><br>Also, nice anon, check'ed.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Biyori Ch. 39 TL is out.  <br>Nobody takes Kanbara seriously.</br>  <br>technology!</br>  <br>Kyaputen needs help.</br>  <br>This... is....

Something like: "... and Shino kept winning every tournament ... but still her mom didn't come back."<br>Then we'll get a Shinohayu plot bombshell at the same time that reporter Nishida reveals Saki and Teru's background in the main series.</br></br>  <br>We can only hope.<br>Can someone remind me what scholarship Shino and her crew wanted? Was it to a middle school?</br></br>  At some point, Shino and her mom might not even recognize each other. It would be sad if they just passed each other walking down the street, though that's unlikely to happen living so far apart.  <br>Asakumi High School<br>Shino has her act together, so I wonder why she doesn't try to go to Tokyo herself to look for her mother. Hayari already went there solo for Mafuka's concert, and Shino has old friends she could stay with.

It will be sad seeing them separate. It's also weird that we don't see the grandparents or any other aunts, uncles, or cousins. <br>Shino is so alone in the world without Richardson.</br></br>  <br>Maybe not totally alone.</br>  <br>Shino is the Kevin Bacon of mahjong.</br>  <br>Akado connects to Nodoka.</br>  <br>...and Nodoka connects to Saki.</br>  <br>I think because she was still scared from Sukoyan and didn't want to expose the children to such monsters.<br><br>Or she asked but the parents denied it.<br>"I will take your daughter to Nara to the prefectural tournament.

I plan on watching a few others still however. Major backlog.<br><br>Dat vice prez.

This one was my favourite  1.Hibike<br>2.Sidonia<br>3.Kekkai</br></br>  Hibikeeping real this season. Kinmoza gets 2nd. Oregairu last because it's oregairu.

Might have something to do with it being finished and having no perspective of new content.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So can someone tell me what Euphonium was about?<br>I watched all of it, but I still have no idea what it was doing.<br>They played some instruments in a band, I think?</br></br>  1.

The drama felt forced</br>  <br>There was also forced drama and forced yuri baiting.</br>  <br>Had an almost perfect end. No need to more threads</br>  <br>I still don't understand why people liked this show. Were you all band geeks or something?</br>  <br>What fictitious drama doesn't feel forced for you niggers?

Just a hunch. Getting the strong sense fans of other stuff don't give a fuck circlejerking it and aren't as insecure and as in need of feeling accepted.</br></br>  <br>Jokes aside, I really don't know what you guys saw in it. It was like taking "cute girls doing cute things" and taking out the "cute" and "doing cute things".<br>And I love cute girls doing cute things.</br></br>  1. Hibike<br>2. Hello Kiniro Mosaic <br>3.Punch Line<br><br>Everything else was shit anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Like this biased thread?</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>What? The show was cute as fuck. The over the top reactions were adorable, especially from Kumiko and Saphire.</br>  <br>Kumiko was angst incarnate and Reina was arguably the most autistic character I have ever seen.<br>All the cute girls were sidelined.</br></br>  <br>Did you even watch the show ? The show was all about moeshit with some drama there and there</br>  HibiKEK a shit.  1.- Pleiades<br>2.- Kekkai<br>3.- Hibike</br></br>  <br>I think you should stick to pure comedies, anon.</br>   People listing Hibikek and Kekkai   <br>Something tells me you'll hate part 4</br>  1.

Hopefully fall will be decent.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What other yuribait series aired this and past year?</br>  <br>No, really, this is one of those shows where I can't possibly think that anyone could like.<br>I suppose it isn't my cup of tea, but at this point it seems people just force themselves to like it because its Kyoani, or maybe I just expected too much out of Kyoani after how good Amagi was.<br>Same goes for Yahari. How can anyone possibly like that?</br></br></br>  1. Hibike<br>2. Kiniro Mosaic<br>3.  Nagato Yuki-Chan <br><br>...<br><br>9001.

Literally 95% of the complaints I saw about it were "they look retarded," and "that's not how Yuki and Kyon are supposed to act!" It was cute and fun. Deal with it.</br>  1. Ninja Slayer<br>2.

Maybe you just don't, and thus shouldn't assume your impression of these shows hold that much weight.</br></br></br>  1. Hibike<br>2 Pleiades<br>3.

There was a lot of forced drama, some yuri baiting and lazy backgrounds by KyoAnus. Hardly any character development by the end of the show.</br>  <br> since I like down to earth, personal drama <br>Perhaps that's it. It came off as way too melodramatic to me and it felt like they never actually gave me a reason to care about the girls. The drama in lets say Plastic Memories or Re-kan!, it felt way more natural while in Euphonium it felt more like "I'm going to create problems for myself and everyone else for absolutely no reason".<br>Why couldn't they just shut the fuck up and play their damn instruments? Was all of that really necessary? What was the whole point of it?</br></br></br>  <br>Well, it sold significantly more than Tamako and KnK. Tamako and KnK got movies, so it's doubtful that Tamako and KnK lost KyoAni money. Thus, it's pretty likely that Hibike gained KyoAni a significant profit. Every studio in Japan would agree to a guaranteed ~6k sales for their anime.</br>  AnimeNewsNetwork = /a/<br><br>You faggots disappoint me.</br></br>   expecting a good story from KYOANI <br>Have you guys not learned from KnK ?</br>  <br> Plastic Memories <br> less melodramatic than Hibike </br></br>  <br> SoLshit anime with blatant gay agenda <br> #1 of the season <br>Not even once.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br> muh /pol/ boogeyman <br>Don't you worry, you fit right in already.</br></br>  <br>More like Hibike Euphoverrated.</br>   show some deep shit conveying everything about her <br> she is the outcast within but fits like the very best.

It'll be a decent adaption at best  I hope they manage to replicate the serious athmosphere of the manga in the anime.<br>The trailer only showed scenes from Yuki's hallucinations, but if the 'real' scenes are just as colorful I doubt they'll feel as depressing as in the manga.</br>  Air date?  <br>Garter-chan best girl.

Do they seriously expect me to take all the drama and tragedy seriously?  Looks like a super edgy "oh no little girls suffering" manga  <br>Pretty edgy bro</br>  <br>It does the little girl suffering pretty well though.</br>  <br>Yes. Perhaps try to foster some empathy, it really helps you enjoy things and not "fucking dropped" them.</br>  <br>Mildly hyped at most. I read the manga so I already know what to expect and whatnot. <br><br>Miki is best girl and loli.</br></br></br>  <br>July 9th. <br>7 days and 12h until first episode.</br></br>  Hope they don't stretch out the bait for too long.

Is this yurishit?  <br/>  cant wait for it to turn into the average Russian DayZ server.  <br>There must be something else, like Symphogear, Seiyuu, Dandelion, or Gate.</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>Perfect, thanks</br>  <br>I liked this when I first read it, but it was a long time ago.<br>Now that I think about it, I think I've gotten out of that phase where I enjoyed edgy shit veiled in cuteness.</br></br>  <br>Ah, good then.</br>  <br> Dandelion <br>pls no</br></br>  Is shovel a Navy Seal?<br><br>She's damn knowledgeable about weapons and survival stuff, and is dashing as fuck.</br></br>  <br>yes, all those are infinitely gayer than GG.</br>  <br><br>Sorry but the premise is already too detached from reality and on top of that they design characters straight out of some loli doujin. I wouldn't mind if they were not going for a serious anime but this is ridiculous.</br></br>  <br>i'm sorry this mongolian cave painting isn't realistic enough for you satan</br>  <br> on top of that they design characters straight out of some loli doujin <br>It really isn't, I would watch it if they looked more like lolis.</br></br>  <br>The art, if you look not two posts above yours, is very dark and serious. Unless you only read Qiuzlax and have a distorted sense of realistic, it doesn't get any better than this.</br>  <br>Impossible. GG is the most hyped anime of the next season. Just look at the Summer 2015 Anime Preview thread <br>Goodbye, comfy threads.</br></br>  <br> Satan's a Manimefag <br>I bet you're going to rig every AOTS/AOTY poll so Gangsta's at the top.</br></br>  <br>You won't trick me Satan.</br>  <br>can't wait for all the <br>"i wuz le not ready 4 dis"<br>posts</br></br></br>  One thing that's good about this manga and that is putting this apart from other generic cute girls suffering shit stories, is that the emotions and reactions of the characters are relatively down to earth and subtle. Even if they are in despair, they wont resort to that standard anime-typical identity-crisis/moralfagging/let's-<wbr>stop-time-and-hold-hours-long-inter<wbr>nal-monologue-shit.<br><br>Just like in this scene:<br><br>In any other mango or anime, Garters would now be a over-the-top drama-queen. But she doesnt. She swallowed the tragedy and moved on, since the survival of the living are far more important than to cry for the dead.</br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br><br><br><br> want some cute yet a bit interesting series <br> it's actually full fledged edgemaster crap <br>God damn it, /a/.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Lerche <br>Abandon hope all ye who enter.</br></br>  <br>Yeah I'm sure it's dark and serious, as serious as a cute hamster pointing a knife at you. It's actually so serious I get a laugh from every chapter I read at how tryhard those little hamsters are trying to look tough.</br>  Why is this allowed.  <br>Kei isn't dead it was just a look alike</br>  The anime script is by the writer of the manga.  I would have been more excited if it was Madhouse since their adaptations have been relatively good but I hope Lerche can make it.  <br>Anon, quit grasping at straws. Kei is dead, just like Radio-chan.</br>  <br>and this.<br><br>Downright criminal lewd behavior.</br></br></br>  <br>Overlord's anime looks terrible though</br>  <br>Maybe this will be Lerche's breakthrough.</br>  <br>Yeah, but Ore no Love Story was good.</br>  <br> Madhouse since their adaptations have been relatively good <br>Fuck off normalfag scum.</br></br>  I don't know why they didn't just advertise it as psychological drama from the start; the shock actor will be of literally one episode.  <br>That's cute. You're growing up.</br>  http://otakomu.jp/archives/273075.h<wbr>tml<br>News aggregators ruining the surprise.</br></wbr>  <br>doesnt matter.<br><br>GG has more than just that surprise.<br><br>It is a surprisingly good survival story by itself, even without the twist.</br></br></br></br></br>  This could become either the next Madoka or just another edgy show with cute characters that won't manage to sell more than 1k.  <br>This. I'm already masturbating to the thought of her sexy legs.</br>  <br>Probably the latter. Madoka was at least anime original, and it was straight forward with being dark.<br>This, on the other hand uses "omg look at the cuteness of these high school girls" then goes all edgy about it as if it was some smart and unique idea.</br></br>  <br>Except Madoka was anime original and had a specifically made team, whereas this is a manga adaptation from mostly a single person. They're completely different.</br>  best girl.  <br>I can actually see these sketchy-like character designs do the angstier parts of the story well.</br>  So, will that teacher/student be some kind of anime original survivor duo  the anime eyes bother me  <br> original survivor duo <br><br>You mean original anime victims.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe. Since all the girls are perfect we need someone to be a shit.</br>  <br>You're trying too hard.</br>  <br>Trying what, exactly?<br>I know that it's cool to like "epic brutal suffering" around here, but it really is just a poor and cheap shock value factor.</br></br>  Looks pretty cute.  Love the concept, so yeah.  So this is the kind of shitty bait we are going to have every thread from now on?  <br>that 'shock value' actually wasnt the main selling point in this story, but more the survivalist part.<br><br>Come on. This is a Zombie story. You cant have a zombie story without some shock value. And this manga actually does it pretty good.</br></br></br>  <br> those skindents up her thighs </br>  <br>Sadly yes. Hopefully Gate can contain the some of if not the majority of the shitposters.</br>    <br> dayz <br>I still remember the time when I had full pristine gear with (semi-)infinite ammo for ak and m4 and like 300 grenades, plus 10 replacements clothes and various other stuff. Too bad they fixed duping.</br></br>  <br> pic related <br>Deel pls translate</br></br>  <br> I know that it's cool to like "epic brutal suffering" around here <br>No it isn't.<br> it really is just a poor and cheap shock value factor. <br>You really are talking out of your ass.

They will get worse.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cute high school girls <br> suffering and drama <br>Oh yes, it is used for shock value, and yes, the title is incredibly edgy, Elfen Lied is the closest that comes to mind.</br></br></br>  <br>here's your reply</br>  <br>So your reply is a shitpost?<br>Color me surprised.</br></br>  <br>literal shit posts deserve shitpost replies</br>  <br> literal shitposts <br>So you're calling an opinion that doesn't collide with yours a shitpost?<br>Good to know.</br></br></br>  <br>yep, so how's your first day here been?</br>  Is this yuri?  <br>No, go away.</br>  <br>Yeah.</br>  <br>Why bother asking? Everything is yuri with eight enough goggles.</br>  <br>see </br>  <br>Go get a teddy bear if you like her that much.</br>  Anyone have any ideas on how they could handle the adaptation? I've tried to think of ways to get the scenes to give off the same vibe of the manga but nothing seems to really come to mind.  <br>Poorly.</br>  <br>Yes. A zombie story with cute girls as topping.<br>It still remains a zombie story. And those are, by definition, edgy.</br></br>  <br> eight enough goggles </br>  <br>Very, very shit. Which is a shame, because the manga threads are really nice.<br><br><br> Dandelion <br>They're already shitting up Dandelion threads despite having even less material to fuel their bullshit than Gakkou Gurashi.<br><br>We're guaranteed to be stuck with obnoxious yurifags for this one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's bait. That's all there is to it.<br><br>I don't even expect any minor character character designs to be used outside of the first episode.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh fucking  lol , I meant tight.</br>  <br>If only Ryūtarō Nakamura was still alive...</br>  <br> zombieshit <br>Zombies need to go away.</br></br>  <br>whats this? another cute girls club anime? when will japan try something new</br>  <br>epic bro, epic</br>  <br>here's your answer<br><br/></br></br>  <br>I still dont get why all of them have different clothes than the pink hair loli</br>   high school of the dead with lolis <br> hyped <br>come on OP ..</br></br>  <br>If only. But they aren't lolis.<br>So there's even less interest.</br></br>  <br>What's the matter, don't like bullet tits?</br>  <br>Good thing this is nothing similar.</br>  <br>keep the faces close to the original.</br>  How many episodes do you think will cover the content that has been published in the manga? My autism is exploding since the group that's doing it are bunch of lazy fucks.  <br>How do you define "edgy"? Anything that isn't comfy?</br>  <br><br><br>Someone posted that bait last thread.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Well, this is practically a zombie story as well, and they are high school girls just like HSOTD girls, so it's pretty similar as far as setting goes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I define edgy as something that portrays mass obliteration, using cute girls suffering for shock values, fighting zombies etc. I'm pretty sure you get the gist.</br>  <br>So conflict is edgy.</br>  <br>they look like lolis, its clear loli pandering</br>  <br> look like lolis <br>Oh god, no they don't. Yuki might be close, but she clearly isn't.<br> clear loli pandering <br>Don't make me laugh. If that were true, they would be younger and looked lolis.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Half of them look like lolis. That's all that matters.</br>  <br>Keep defending your delisions, just type CTRL + F Loli, if you get more than 5 results it's clear that it's otaku loli pandering with a zombie mind break cookie cutter plot.</br>  <br>Yuki looks somewhat like a loli, but others don't.</br>  <br><br> LRD <br> Doing that again <br>Oh boy, this shit again. Every fucking time.</br></br></br></br>  Your regular moe slice of life show, with a bunch of girls wandering around having silly fun and nothing much happening! Except they’re trapped in school when a zombie apocalypse comes to pass. I suspect the extraordinary premise will be in the background as most of the show focuses on the “cute girls being cute” focus, which I absolutely find mind-numbingly dull, but I am going to give it a try, even if Koufuku Graffiti and Kantai Collection should’ve taught me better.  <br>Congrats, you have no idea what it's about. Keep talking out of your ass, I'm sure you'll go far in life.</br>  <br>There is no somewhat. She just is.

We were calling this loli zombie before you came to our threads.</br>  <br>A better depiction than whatever is in your brain.<br>She was never supposed to be a loli, as you can see.</br></br>  <br>It was great at the beginning and died somewhere around the middle.</br>  <br> calling it loli zombie <br> when no girls, aside maybe Yuki are lolis <br>Yeah, sure, that's a legit name.</br></br></br>  <br>I knew you'd post that.</br>  <br> Looks nothing like the manga design <br>I can post loli basket ball and Holmes art that makes them look busty too, retard.</br></br>  <br>It's like trying to call the GochiUsas lolis when 3 of the 5 don't qualify at all.</br>  <br>No, but really. I actually enjoyed Kotoura-san, and I don't get all the shit people give it.</br>  <br>You're a joke, THK. Go back trolling in Nanoha threads.</br>  <br>Yuki and Miki are loli. Just deal with it, dude.</br>   Gakkou Gurashis <br> lolis <br>What? That's just the artstyle depicting EVERYONE as petite.<br><br>Next you're going to tell me Megu-nee is a loli.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sorry if you not feel immersed to this kind of artstyle, you Satan. Well then, just drop it.</br></br>  <br>But Miki is always busty.<br>Also<br><br>Your samefagging couldn't be more obvious, retard.<br>Try waiting a bit longer before you post again, blind troll.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>people think anything that's small and cute is loli now<br>there are people in this world that think Hestia is a loli</br></br>  <br>It's just one fag calling them lolis, and people who point him out on being retarded trolls.<br>Don't listen to him.<br>The design is cutesy, but the girls are clearly not lolis.</br></br></br>  <br> Miki <br> busty <br>Literally never.</br></br></br>  <br>She clearly has at least enough breast under the clothes for that illustration to be viable.</br>  <br>That's the author being a silly-head.</br>  <br>Heh, it's more about survival of these girls, m8. There are not many cute scenes in the manga, though.<br>As a someone who have read the manga, it's more than what you says, m8.</br></br>  <br>That doesn't change the fact that casual scum believes him. They also call Lili a loli, so that's that.</br>  <br>At least, it'll hopefully be more than what he says, if the anime adaptation isn't shit.</br>  <br>You mean less.<br>Retarded zombie stories are the lowest kind of setting in any media.<br>Thankfully it will fail too because of that fact.</br></br></br>  First, Gangsta, then Gakkou Gurashi.<br>FUCK OFF SHITPOSTERS REEEEEEEEEEEEEE</br>  <br>Petite and small tits.
