[ In this thread, we mourn the loss of THE MAN, GONGENZAKA.<br><br>Press F to Pay Respects<br><br>Thread Theme: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=On1<wbr>6Buam5QU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  Did he lose to Blackwings?<br><br>Poor guy.</br></br>  F<br><br>It's not like he's dead though</br></br>  F<br><br><br>He should have  BOUGHT BLACKWINGS </br></br></br>  Crow will most likely get knocked off the Friendship Cup by Shun who will not care for the fact that he has kids to protect because of MUH RURI.  I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Ruri is in fact, XYZ/Ruri, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, XYZ plus Ruri. Ruri is not an imouto unto itself, but rather another free individual of a fully functioning XYZ universe made useful by the Overlay Network, Overlay Units and Ranks, thus comprising a dimension as defined by the Numeron Code.  <br>Old whore losing to new whore.</br>    Not really that upsetting. Gon got to show off more cards, Crow is more important to the current plot, and this isn't the first time Gon has lost to show someone being stronger (he lost in the Battle Royal so Yuzu could double OTK).  Have you bought Blackwings yet, /a/rc-V?  <br>Stallman pls.</br>  <br>People like Yuzu, nobody likes Crow or his Blackwings.</br>  <br>No one was butthurt about that because Gon knows his bro likes a hoe and so he will go to any extent necessary to make sure that she stayed in the tournament so that he could duel her like he promised her he would.<br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>Gon's schtick has always been self-sacrifice, almost to a fault</br>  <br>I sure as hell like Crow more than Gon.</br>   Episode 65 <br> no Jack Atlas remix <br><br> Episode 66 <br> nothing happens <br><br> Episode 67 <br> Gon loses to a meme <br><br>show = dropped<br><br>I knew I should have stopped after Season 1.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reposting Gongenzaka's new Superheavy Kishou<br> Pendulum effect: When a SHS monster you control destroys an opponent's monster by battle, you can destroy this card; that monster can attack again. <br> Monster effect: This card is treated as a "Superheavy Samurai" monster while on the field. If you have no Spell/Trap cards in your Graveyard, you can tribute up to 2 SHS monsters you control; draw 1 card for each monster tributed. You can only use this effect once per turn. <br>So is it any good? You can't search it or anything and it's level 1 so you can't Pendulum Summon it constantly</br></br></br>  <br>See you next week.</br>  <br>They're both shit characters, but Crow is way worse, he steals the spotlight from people constantly and blackwings are shit cards.</br>  <br>FUCK OFF??!!</br>  <br> Level 1 Pendulum <br>Looks like the Sawatari virus got him, poor Gon.</br></br>  F uck all of you Crow haters <br><br> Stay mad, Gonfags </br></br>  <br>I don't know who you are, but I will find you, and when I do, I'll card you.</br>  Bringing back old characters was a mistake.  <br>It's Reiji, he only makes cards good for himself and Dennis.</br>   realized that everytime Gon shows a new Synchro, he loses.   <br>Stay salty.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128613741 <br>Yeah now that I realize it, every time Gon shows off a new Synchro, he does lose. Now we know how his Benkei moment is pulled off.</br>  <br>Anime was a mistake.</br>  <br>I like Blackwings.<br><br>Neutral towards Crow.<br><br><br>People actually believe Crow not existing would make fodder like Rua better make me laugh.<br><br>Crow isn't well written but losers stay losers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>BUY BLACKWING KIDS</br>  <br>"All the spin-offs were a mistake." - Kazuki Takahashi</br>  <br>I sure am glad we are getting mire Blackwings no other characters should have there cards printed. I am also looking forward to Crow beating Yuri.</br>  <br>"It all went downhill after the demon penis." - Kazuki Takahashi</br>  <br>BUY BLACKWINGS AND RED DEMON'S DRAGONS</br>  <br> actually think Gon will win </br>  <br> Implying Gon does relevant things in card games <br><br><br>Turkeys are cool.</br></br></br></br>  <br>History literally repeating itself, everything after 64 is shit.</br>   there were people who seriously expected Gon to defeat Crow "BUY BLACKWINGS" Hogan <br><br>You really only have yourselves to blame.</br></br>  <br> Took Sawatari's Yosenjus away and gave him TRASH cards <br> Also gave Gongenzaka TRASH Pendulums <br>WILL SOMEONE STOP THIS MADMAN?</br></br></br>  Holy shit this is hilarious<br><br>Anyone who thought Gongenzaka even had a spic of a chance at winning is retarded<br><br>Anyone who legitimately hates Arc-V Crow is retarded<br><br>Anyone not satisfied with that based as fuck duel, probably one of the bet duel of Synchro arc, is literally and inherently retarded<br><br>Cry more as your precious samurai is sent off to dig his own grave, literally</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>5d's actually more interesting since Crow appear.</br>  Maybe it's just because I'm tired, but I actually don't care that Gon lost, even though I thought I would. He's dueled for a good bit up to this point, and we all know others are going to eventually fetch him from wherever he's sent (or he escapes on his own).  <br> probably one of the best duels of Synchro arc <br>That's because all the duels in the Synchro Arc have been shit. The only good duel since Yuya vs. Reiji was against Chojiro.</br></br>  <br>I agree, especially direct sequels. Yes, I'm talking about GX, Fuck GX!</br>  <br>I hope Crow replaces Gon as a lancer that would be good.</br>  <br> Crow is more important to the current plot <br>How so? I haven't started the Syncro World arc yet.</br></br>  <br>He's basically a shit commander. Once the Lancers fall apart, he's probably going to bargain Serena/Yuzu to R/Leo to keep Standard safe.</br>  <br>lel Gongenzaka gets new card shilled every duel. You guys are the reason we still don't have Yuto, Serena, or Funky Comedian cards</br>  <br>He's a genius, not a shit commander. He's intentionally fucking over certain characters to get a specific reaction out of other people. He's even manipulating his own brother just to get to Yuya.</br>  <br> M-muh Steadfast dueling <br> D-dont need Action card </br></br>  <br>Then watch and find out for yourself</br>  <br>If Konami wanted to print them, they would, no matter what a bunch of gaijin manchildren say.<br><br>They don't, so they're not.</br></br></br>   All these crowfags in this thread. <br>I can believe such shit taste, /Arc-V/ used to be better.</br>  <br>Blame the delusional faggots who liked gay Transformers knockoffs and toy dragons.<br><br>Boipussy lust stronk. Especially if its shota pussy</br></br></br>  <br>No man only based Blackwings deserve to be printed. I can't wait for Crow to become Yuyas new best friend.</br>  <br>He got to show off more SHS and that's all that really mattered. He was the most important character that Crow could beat, anyone more important would bullshit a win somehow even if they're "weaker." The only characters left Crow has to beat are whoever wins between Shinji/Tsukikage, Tokumatsu, fodder, Sawatari if he isn't fed to strongu, and possibly Serena but that one's not going to happen anyway.</br>  <br>Does Reiji know that Dennis is from Fusion?</br>  <br>watch it dumbass</br>   people unironically liking Crow in any capacity   <br>We will be getting Yuto's cards printed soon with the reveal of the XYZ booster set. Serena will get her cards printed in the next Fusion oriented booster set alongside the Ancient Gear support. Sawatari's Underworld Trope would probably be printed in a set like the Secret Forces.</br>  <br> People still mad over Crow </br>  <br> Steadfast duel <br> already riding on a D-Wheel <br>fucker should have just picked up the action card</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>This is bullshit. Every card Gongenzaka has used thus far bar this duel has been released. It's turning into BUY SUPERHEAVIES at this point.<br><br>Where the fuck are Serena's cards? Where are Sawatari's? Where the fuck are Reiras?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> everything after 64 is shit <br>Kek, if that happens people won't have Yoshida to blame this time.</br></br>  <br>Why would Reiji want to extend Yuya's list of strikes against himself?</br>  <br>I'm not even mad that Gon lost, I even knew it was going to happen, I'm just mad that people are being absolutely fucking obnoxious about it right now.</br>  <br>ITS PART OF KEIKAKU</br>  <br>It's like pottery.</br>  <br><br>Fine. Be stingy about it.</br></br>  <br>Why don't you ask Konami?</br>  <br>I don't mind Crow, but that is wrong as shit.</br>  <br><br>Fusion special pack like HSR and Wings raider</br></br>  <br>Because Reiji gets a sadomasochistic surge out of toeing the line of danger by walking on the edge, whether it's making barters he can't fulfill or putting himself in the way of self-harm.<br><br>Hence, D/D/D.</br></br></br>  <br>Moonlights are just Tenki + Allure targets. What do they do that is more exciting than Fluffals?<br><br>Sawatari's new deck is just Dart Shooters all over again.<br><br><br> Faggots buttblasted over their Sora 0.5 job slut </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jack is successful and he isn't. <br><br>That's pretty much his relevancy.</br></br></br>  <br>Stay mad, Gonfag. This happens every time duels like this take place.</br>  <br> Implying they wouldn't give some non-answer <br>You know damn well we cant' ask any soulless corporation about anything and get a straight answer.</br></br>  <br>I don't feel nearly as frustrated as I was with 5D's, though</br>  <br>Crow's Yusei?</br>  <br>At least it's not a shitty filler arc like pre-WRGP</br>  <br>I once emailed them and asked them when they were going to make NK actually good, and they just told me to keep buying their stuff.</br>  <br>Might as well be Synchro's Yusei instead of Yugo.</br>   Crow Riding Duel <br>Previous thread explode to 600+ posts.<br>Best part of that episode is Crow stunt with Blackbird grabbing Action Card</br></br>  <br>It would have been the same had Gongenzaka won, except more people would be talking shit about Crow and spamming DONT BUY BLACKWINGs</br>  It's okay guys, Crow is simply better than Gon<br> Just like how Reiji was better than Yuya </br>  <br>I'm not mad about Gon losing neither, but more about Crow winning. You could replace Gon with Sawatari, Dennis, Ninja, or even with ENJOY, and I would be still mad. Crow has no impact to the plot, nor any emotional involvement with any of the Lancers, so I don't know why he is still in the tournament.</br>  <br>What you think is irrelevant. They will get released sooner or later anyway. ;)</br>  <br>Would've been better if he started flying instead with those wings</br>  <br><br>So this is the curse of Synchro summoning, isn't it?</br></br>  What even   Under the command of Akaba Leo, he is trying to kidnap Yuzu and Serena away to the Fusion Dimension <br> and Serena </br>  <br> tfw Reiji, Sawatari, and Shun become the new cool kids and spend their time running through academia halls disrupting class shouting Serena and Ruri </br>  <br>I once asked if they could name the card artist for Laundsallyn, and they replied that they wish they knew, but have no idea. And that they hope I can find out somehow on my own.<br><br>Who else besides Konami am I supposed to ask?</br></br></br>  <br>I doubt he's strong enough to carry 2 girls at the same time.<br>Also, Fusion arc pls hurry.</br></br>  <br>I'm more expecting Yuzu to go around screaming Serena.mp3 to every faceless mook she sees after Serena gets kidnapped in place of Yuzu.</br>  Reminder that Synchro was a mistake  <br>This is pretty much a shitty pre-Academia filler arc, though.</br>  I fucking hate Crow. I hate his design. I hate his monsters's design except one or two. Even so i knew that he was most likely to win because him winning would create infighting between the Lancers and make the plot more interesting.<br>If Gon won what would happen. Crow entrusts Yuya with showing them Tops like every shounen hero?</br>  <br>Dennis will take Serena with him while Yuri takes Yuzu.</br>  <br>Its boring bur the Crow hatedom would rather have something that simple than more turkeybirds filling packs.</br>  I'm more interested in seeing matches between characters that really, really don't want to fight each other. Mainly Yuya, Serena, or Yugo vs Yuzu.  <br>I don't think Serena cares too much honestly.</br>  <br> losers of tourney are put into forced labor <br> Reiji probably knows this if Chojiro does <br> Gon can take it since he's a mountain of a man <br> risks sending Reira there despite that him being like 10 years old, and untested <br><br>What is wrong with Reiji?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Half of Serena's reason for joining the Lancers is for Yuzu.</br>  <br>Implying this isnt all part of his keikaku</br>  <br>Try only reason, she's going to kidnap Yuzu.</br>  <br>Yeah but if Yuzu goes to the mines, Serena will just leave the cup and go rescue her, leading to Yuri/Dennis capturing them both.</br>   Losers get sent to forced labour <br>OH SHIT WE CRASHTOWN ARC AGAIN<br> MANZOKU </br></br>  Wonder how Yuya and Chojiro got out of their suiteprison cell.<br><br>Feels like the reason why Yuya bumped into Reiji and Reira in the first place was because it was his chance to look for Yuzu.</br></br>  <br>Chojiro has mad connections because he's fucking Chojiro, so he pretty much gets to roam free every so often.<br><br>Reiji, and as a result Reira, can do whatever the fuck he pleases because he's Kaikakuman.</br></br></br>  <br> Wonder how Yuya and Chojiro got out of their suiteprison cell. </br>  <br>BLACKBIRD BEST DUEL RUNNER</br>  <br>Yes, please.<br><br>It's one of my favorites 5D's mini-arcs.</br></br></br>   1 Tuner + or more non-Tuner monsters <br> If this card was Synchro Summoned using a "Blackwing" monster as a Synchro Material, it is treated as a Tuner monster. Once per turn: You can send 1 "Blackwing" monster from your hand to the Graveyard; inflict 300 damage to your opponent. </br>  <br> Blackwings get delta accel synchro </br>  Synchro arc was a mistake<br>Crow was a mistake</br>  <br>Reiji never steps away from looking the big picture. To the point that he views everyone else as pieces on a gameboard, and never gets that close with anyone.<br><br>In contrast, Yuya strays from the bigger picture when he gets fixated on what's close to himYuzu, but he also has a few genuine friends.</br></br></br>  <br> Yuzu <br>I meant to put that in parentheses</br></br>  Why didn't Gon use Flutist?  <br>Kiryu should have been better than Crow in Arc-V, imho.  Also Infernities &gt; Blackwings. </br>  <br>Doesnt have the same effect</br>  <br>How exactly? He would have drove that hatred for the Jack harder than Crow has and wouldn't have anything to add to the plot besides working on the mines.</br>  <br> People actually like Kiryu <br>That's a good enough reason. Especially since the 5D Characters were brought back for fanservice and BUY BLACKWINGS.</br></br>  You guys told me ARC-V was good.  <br>Oh right. Flutist is shit in the anime. I forgot. Shame because it could have saved Gon at least twice.</br>  <br>It was, until Ep. 65, just like 5Ds, and guess who is the fault of both of them.<br><br>Crow.</br></br></br>  <br>IT KEEPS HAPPENING</br>  I'm a 5Ds fag who hasn't really seen Arc V. Watched it so I could see the satsification of Crow losing. He fucking wins against an Arc V character who I know has lots of cards released so he must be fairly prominent. Damn you guys. You said it would be different. He just went full BUY BLACKWINGS.  <br>Stop this stupid meme. People like Crow too, you guy just force your unnecessary hatred for him down everyone's throat like cancer. You dislike 5D's Crow so you take it out on Arc-V Crow? Retarded.<br><br>And the 5D's characters brought back were popular characters, character that people liked and were well versed in Synchro Summoning for the Synchro Dimension. Not to mention Kiryu only has one Synchro monster.that he only used once. In a filler arc.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not convinced until they spend 3-4+ episodes on cup ramen or something relating to cup ramen and a tiny clown</br>  <br> a-am i fitting in guys..? </br>  This has to be the most polarizing duel yet.  <br>That's Sora vs Shun the first round.</br>  <br>It's honestly hilarious<br><br>Crow haters can stay mad as long as they want, doesn't change the fact that the angrier they get, the clearer it gets that they are all getting their asses devastated by Blackwings</br></br></br>  <br> People like Crow too <br>Outside of Tumblr fangirls not really. Most were meh on him or disliked him. Blackwings were popular, not Crow. After his first few duels he stopped using good Blackwings which led to more hate because now it was just pack filler. Back in 5Ds days you couldn't even discuss Crow without starting a flame war. He's back for BUY BLACKWINGS not popularity.</br></br>  <br>Most people just laugh at Sora for being a egomaniacal scrub.<br><br>Even when he beat Shun I just could not care.<br><br><br>Generic Blackwings are why my ship faggotry died and/or Morphtronics aren't tier 1.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Its fucking obvious some people are going to get carded and crow and jacku are going to join the lancers because fucking academia is gonna rekt shit before the tournament ends.<br><br><br>My carded list:<br><br> Gongenzaka <br> The ENJOYYY guy <br> Dennis <br> Reiji </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I fucking love THE MAN GONGENZAKA and I dunno what you guys were even bitching about.<br><br>That was a great duel and this version of Crow is a really good character. 5D's happened like five years ago, get over it.</br></br>  <br>Good thing Blackwings aren't part of the meta, they get run over too easily.</br>  <br>I dunno, I can't really bring myself to be worked up over it. I get why Crow winning is annoying, but people are acting like it's the dealbreaker to end all dealbreakers, and it's not like Gon lost 4000-0</br>  <br> Judai's soul patch. </br>  <br>Fujos are people too.<br><br>Terrible people but they are part of the YGO fandom.<br><br>Besides people tolerate Shun despite his Marty Stu shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I dunno what you guys were even bitching about. <br>Crow</br></br>  <br>I know right. People are acting like Crow beat Gongenzaka 4000-0. Crow was down to a 100 LP people.<br>Though I wouldn't call Crow great.</br></br>  Since Gongenzaka lost and they throw him out the competition/building/tops does this mean he is gonna  be carded   <br>If Crow and Jack join the Lancers I'm fucking done with this. It just stops being Arc-V at that point and becomes 5Ds 2 and them trying to fix the mistakes of the past. <br><br>That's stupid, they need to stay in Synchro and that's it. <br><br>Besides if anybody is getting carded in Synchro it's Ninja, ENJOY, Crow's friends, Shinji, and Crow.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gon isn't getting carded pre Academia. I doubt any of the Lancers even Tsukikage are.</br>  <br> this version of Crow is a good character <br><br> 5Ds Crow <br>FOOD AND KIDS<br> Arc-V Crow <br>FOOD AND KIDS<br><br>He's the same character, he's just got less time to talk so it's not as hard to see him as as big of a fag as he was in 5Ds.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Besides if anybody is getting carded in Synchro it's Ninja, ENJOY, Crow's friends, Shinji, and Crow <br>Why</br></br>  <br>Shun fades into the background after he does his thing. Like his whole 3OTK against elite Security was followed by him having not said a word since the point Reiji made his re-entrance.</br>  <br> he's just got less time to talk <br>that fixes like 90 fucking percent of the problems with 5D's Crow, so.</br></br>  <br>Ninja because he's a plot device of character's being able to escape easily, it's why there aren't two of them around, because two guys flashing in and out is broken, and him being in Academia would be a bit too broken towards the Lancers. <br><br>ENJOY, because, well old dudes never survive sadly. <br><br>Crow's friends because they're useless, Shinji and Crow because they'll protect the kids.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Besides if anybody is getting carded in Synchro it's Ninja, ENJOY, Crow's friends, Shinji, and Crow. <br>So basically you want the plan to make Synchro allies to assault Academia null because you're butthurt about Crow?<br><br>Jeez man</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then what was the point of going to Synchro in the first place if everyone will be carded?</br>  <br>Crow got a Signer dragon and was overall background noise.<br><br>Shun will probably wreck Crow just because Xyz swag and you gotta make the eternally asshurt Rua and Aki fans happy. It'll make synchrofags mad though.</br></br></br>  <br>They can recruit Shinji. Imagine the rage if Crow became a permament cast member.</br>  <br>Why do a handful matter when Reiji's gunning for the Council to put the entire City and its forces on Standard's side?</br>  <br> Imagine the rage if Crow became a permament cast member. <br>Who cares?</br></br>  <br> Crow defeats Dennis <br><br>Oh lawd people would scream and want turkeys dead.</br></br></br>  <br>Because the entire City and its force aren't all going to Academia. The plan isn't to rally up forces to stay and protect the dimension, it's to make allies to assault Academia. The entire reason why they made a pit stop at Synchro is to get strong duelists to come with them to fight off Leo.</br>  So Gongenzaka and Dennis got Pendulums.<br>Will Shun, Serena, Reira and Ninjabro get pendulums?<br>Will Yuzu ever get Melodious pendulums?</br></br>  <br><br> Crow friends getting carded <br><br>This needs to happen.</br></br></br></br>  <br> you gotta make the eternally asshurt Rua and Aki fans happy <br>DAMN STRAIGHT <br><br> I enjoyed this duel and am enjoying this Crow though </br></br></br></br>  Take a minute to admire the best scene in Arc V so far.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1Pv<wbr>4LjRbET8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> They can recruit Shinji <br><br>What good will one person do? Especially one person who has his mind set on an inner city rebellion rather than an interdimensional rebellion.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't forgot Crow himself.</br>  <br>Imo, Reiji winning on Yuya's turn is better than Shun winning because Sora blanked out on his own monster's effect</br>     Jack and Crow stay behind to protect Synchro <br> Shinji joins the Lancers <br> ENJOY gets carded to protect Yuya and Sawatari's entertainment and new wave of dueling <br> Dennis teams up with Yuri and kidnaps Yuzu/Serena <br> Yugo gets nom'd by Yuri after he flips his shit over Rin and him trying to kidnap Yuzu as well <br> Yuya flips his shit after realizing Yuzu has been kidnapped <br> Him and Gon disband from the Lancers to go to Academia <br> Sawatari follows along despite Gon's protests <br> Reiji, Reira, Ninjabro, and Shinji go to Academia themselves to get back Serena as a bargaining chip against Leo <br> Reira inevitable betrays Reiji and spills the beans to Leo about everything <br> Shun does his own thing and gives up on the Lancers <br> Serena/Yuzu vs. Ruri/Rin Fusion Duel <br> Shun gets carded in Academia <br> Gon gets carded in Academia <br> Ninjabro gets carded in Academia <br> Shinji gets carded in Academia <br> Yuya/Sawatari vs. Sora/Dennis <br> Sora gets carded by Dennis after Sora starts having fun and his ideals waiver <br> Sawatari gets carded in Academia <br> Dennis gets carded in Academia <br> Leo's plan works with the Ruris <br> Yuya/Reiji vs. Leo/Yuri <br> Some shit goes down and Yusho with his Lancers show up (Sherry, Ushio, etc.) <br><br>I'm from the future, you can trust me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Crow had nothing to do with Aki, but he did take away from Rua. <br><br>Worst thing of 5Ds is Sherry's 'development'.</br></br></br>  <br>There was literally nothing wrong with episode 65. What is your deal?</br>  <br>The problems with 5D's extend beyond just Crow, though. The way he was involved was more like a symptom than the cause.</br>  <br>65 was basically a disguised recap episode, but I also don't really care since it was only a matter of time that one showed up</br>  <br>Can't believe you took the time to type this autism.</br>  <br> 光と影 <br>Kiryu confirmed to coming back and pairing up with Yuya.</br></br>  <br>Motherfucker. What the fuck just you do?</br>  <br><br>Is this still worth getting into ? I dropped the whole shit when they introduce pendulum thingie and made card text longer than a chinese train wreck. Never get past GX anime,MC too much of an obnoxious little cunt there so I lost interest in watching whatever came after it.</br></br>  <br>Yes, but you probably don't deserve to watch it</br>  <br>Rua was next in line to become a Signer (although there's evidence he would always get the heart, not the tail) Aki was the third protagonist behind Jack. Crow snaked this away from both of them.<br><br> Worst thing of 5Ds is Sherry's 'development'. <br>No arguments here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>According to /a/, Crow winning a duel the biggest dealbreaker known to man, so there's no point in watching</br>  <br> There was literally nothing <br><br>Yeah, that sums it up.</br></br></br>  <br> implying Yuya would tag with Reiji <br><br>And if they did Yuya would probably be his LP shield.</br></br></br>  <br> Episode 65 <br> no Jack Atlas remix <br>First of all, that was episode 64. Second of all, I can't believe you're actually using that as some kind of negative when the episode as a whole was incredibly good</br></br></br>  <br>They are still mad Aki never join wgp</br>  <br>I can't believe you post on /a/ with that attitude, faggot. <br><br>Exactly.</br></br></br>  <br>Yuya would tag with Reiji if they were the only ones left in the cast. Like Yuma/Nasch vs. Don Thousand</br>  What would Crow have to do to get people to like him?   I was only nine years old <br> I loved Crow Hogan so much, I owned all the Blackwings and merchandise <br> I pray to Crow every night, thanking him for the food I have been given <br> "Crow is love," I say, "Crow is life" <br> My dad hears me and calls me a filthy commons <br> He is obviously jealous of my devotion to Crow <br> I called him a traitor, a sellout to the Tops <br> He beats me 2-0 because of Red Demon's Dragon <br> I am crying now, because I'm hungry <br> I post about it on /a/, and they tell me CROW SUCKS <br> I feel a warmth moving towards me <br> I fell something touch me <br> It's Crow <br> I am so happy <br> He whispers into my ear, "Buy Blackwings" <br> He grabs me with his unwashed hands and puts me on my hands and knees <br> I'm ready <br> I activate my duel disk for Crow <br> He summons a gajillion Blackwings <br> I have no skill, but I do it for Crow <br> I can feel my hand emptying as my field starts to fill up <br> I push against his force <br> I want to please Crow <br> He yells a mighty yell as he tunes his synchro monsters to summon another Synchro monster <br> My Dad walks in <br> Crow looks him deep in the eyes and says, "For the children!" <br> Crow jumps out the window after stealing all of our cards and all of our food <br> Crow is love, Crow is life </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only beat people nobody likes or win against filler only.</br>  <br>He probably would if there was a pressing reason.<br><br>But Yuma and Shark were best friends and had experience tag teaming together, while it's hard to imagine Yuya even having a friendly conversation with Reiji.</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly this.</br>  Think of it this way guys<br><br>Fusion invasion of Synchro will be all the sweeter.</br></br>  <br>Crow sacrifices his life saving Gongenzaka when Gongenzaka was about to sacrifice his own life to save Yuya</br>   I knew Crow would win <br> It's still painful when it actually happens </br>   people freaking out because we had a meh episode <br>Holy shit it's has more than 52 episodes don't expect every single one of them to be some sort of AOTY it's like this is your first anime about card games.</br>  <br>It doesn't matter how the actual duel was, everyone's problem is with who won</br>  <br>Stop using blackwings. <br>Stop talking.<br>No kids.<br>Stop dueling. <br><br>Basically be Honda.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was a pretty good episode actually, but people tend to lose their shit when things involving Crow happen.</br>  <br>Actually this was, by all accounts, a very good episode. People just don't like Crow.<br><br>Though when I think about it, I don't think Gon had lost before this</br></br></br>  <br>Gon lost to Yaiba ages ago, lost to Yuya before the Championship, and lost during the Championship so Yuzu could win.</br>  <br>He managed to tie with Yaiba, and that was when he only had Ben-K</br>  <br>Aki and Rua are shit characters and most women in shonen are destined to be painfully useless or the second coming of Erza Scarlet which isn't goof either.<br><br>But yeah Blackwing shilling does bother people for somewhat justified reasons.</br></br></br>  DORO!  <br>If you're not first, you're last. Drawing might as well be the same as losing, because it's not winning.</br>  <br>Blackwings might as well be the new HEROES at this point, it's ridiculous. I fully expect the next YGO series to have them or to just pop Crow back in with brand new cards.</br>  <br>Good*<br><br><br><br>People have unhealthy attachments to shit characters because "muh shipping/a fappable slut!" or "muh underdog!"<br><br>Crow is here to stay for the time being. He'll fade into the background sooner or later.<br><br><br>I'll say this: the Blackwing main deck isn't as painful as HEROes at least.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> x are the new HEROs <br>Every time</br></br>  <br> Blackwings might as well be the new HEROES at this point <br>Uh no. They are still making new HEROes. Blackwings were a thing for a short while and then stopped for like 4 years</br></br>  So what actually happened to Gon after he lost? Did they just eject him from the building, or is he actually on a bus to Crashtown? Or have they not shown what happened yet?  Should I add some Xyz?  Did Crow use some new Blackwings here?  <br>I kept a very small shimmer of hope that Gon could win. Shame but nothing beats BUY BLACKWINGS.<br><br>It can't come soon enough. Torch everything to the ground, Academia.</br></br></br>  <br>Of course, Gear Gigant basically searches everything you need except for Benkei. Also,<br> ever using kabuto </br></br>   Superheavy Maju Kyu-B <br> This card can only attack the monster your opponent controls with the highest ATK (your choice, if tied). This card can attack while in face-up Defense Position. If it does, apply its DEF for damage calculation. This card gains 900 DEF for each Special Summoned monster your opponent controls. </br>  Did Crow kill everybody's hype? Thread's really quiet right now.  <br>Could be cool and could set up some stupid OTK stuff with soulbuster gauntlet.</br>  Konami hates synchro so much they even made a whole arc of shittyness about them just to prove how much they hate it. It's fucking working, So far all the new synchros shown have been complete mediocre garbage not even Clear Wing is that good.  <br>Stream is over. All the raging was done in the previous thread and this one. Nothing to hype about. We already know Tsukikage vs Shinji next episode</br>  GON<br><br>JUST ATTACK<br><br>DONT LISTEN TO HIS SHITTY SOB STORY<br><br>JUST<br><br>FUCKING<br><br>ATTACK<br><br>BEFORE HE GETS AN ACTION CARD<br><br>GON</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone calmed down I think, hopefully.</br>  <br> Using 3 spell cards in a Steadfast duel <br>Blasphemy</br></br>  <br>I think shuffle reborn would actually be a good idea in a Superheavy deck.</br>  <br>At least Selena is still perfect.</br>  <br>That's not Shuffle Reborn, I actually don't know what it is </br>  <br>I was screaming for Gon to attack as well because I knwew what would happen after the story ended.</br>    Anything else i can add/exchange?  <br>+Hungry Burger</br>  <br><br>Never known a pile of shit is deserving of anything.</br></br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br>I run 3 crobats and insight and 2 chickens.</br>  <br>Ah man, it's like 5ds never ended. We had BUY BLACKWINGS maymays in Arc-V threads before, but not like this. Truly a spectacular maymay comeback.<br><br><br>Anyway, speaking about the latest episode itself, was anyone else surprised to see that Dennis, locked alone in his room, still said "Gon-chan" and looked worried when Gon lost? I'd have expected that academia psychopath to put on a Marik slasher smile or something instead.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He knows he's being watched. Not to mention Reiji probably has installed spycams in all the lancer duel disks.</br>  <br>"In retrospect, Zorc's character design was the peak of my artistic ability. It was always going to be downhill from such an upright masterpiece"</br>  <br>Brecause of Jack, duh. I'm waiting for them to drop the bombshell that will be truth of the bakctory between those two.<br><br> Because they are going to do that, right? They wre not just using old character designs on new characters to pander to nostalgiafags without keeping their personalities or relationships in some form, right?  </br></br></br>  <br>I totally thought it was going to be Black-Winged Dragon's answer to Scarright, instead we got a slightly edgier looking assault blackfeather. Meh.</br>  <br>Insight gets useless when you use Pendulum Call.<br><br>Hmm, i could bring it down to 2 chickens, what to add in place then?</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Crow jumps out the window after stealing all of our cards and all of our food <br>kek</br></br>  <br> Jack is back because nostalgiafags <br> Crow is back because you all need to Buy Blackwings </br></br>  <br>Who's going to win, I'm with Ninjabro.</br>  <br>Dennis is not that good a spy. He almost revealed he was a mole when surrounded by all the lancers, I doubt he'd be paranoid about cameras. Plus he seemed the most worried other than Yuzu, I doubt that anyone would be suspicious of him for not really caring about Gon all that much.</br>  <br>With chicken i meant Apex Avian</br>  <br>I'm going to be sad when she is inevitably kidnapped and then nom'd. <br><br>Arc-V is horrible. Yuto dies, Ruris are gonna die, Yugo is gonne aide, Crow stuff, ENJOY will get carded.<br><br>This series has more suffering than all of the others.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ruris are gonna die <br><br>I will not accept that.</br></br></br>  What if everyone were kindergartners?      <br>Too bad.</br>      <br>Serena would probably be stabbing people with No. 2 penciles...awww I just got nostalgia for kindergarten. ;_;</br>  I'm amazed by how people can be such obnoxious over the result of duel. Fine, Crow won, Gon lost, what's the freaking big deal about it? They both shilled a shit ton of their respective archetypes. And even if the other one would have won, both will sure as hell not be making it to the grand final (or semi even) to be too relevant in the tournament.<br><br>Despite that I love Gongenzaka and on the fence about Crow, I'm perfectly fine with what we've got from the episode, which gave us a great duel nevertheless. The writer assigned these characters to be part of different plot lines, just accept it and move on.</br></br>    <br>At least post-fused Judai would keep order.</br>  <br>End, now if only understood what anyone was saying.</br>  <br>The problem is it feels like despite their relevancy to a plot point that has nothing to do with anything (Jack the Traitor), that it's shoving Gon out of the way for a character we had ages ago that is no different than what he used to be. It's the same character, just like Jack.<br><br>And as much as I like Jack and I'm indifferent to Crow, they really are distracting from the plot pretty heavily now, Jack a little less so though.<br><br>Crow should have dueled one of his friends, it'd been better character development for him, while Gon got to fight say Shinji/Kage, so they can both get development and it doesn't matter one way or the other, but showcase both of their decks off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Let my princess do as she pleases.</br>  <br>a good splashable card. To think KoA would give us an exclusive like this wow.</br>  Gon didn't even want to win. He saw the tournament was important for Crow as a common, and that he cares about the kids, he just wanted Crow to duel him all out. You guys are retarded if you think Gon cares about winning or losing he just wants a honorable duel.  arc-v crow kinda look like pedophile to me  <br>This is what people are missing. Gon could have attacked while Crow was doing his sob story but he chose not to do and let Crow get an Action Card. He practically let Crow win.</br>  <br>Gon needs to stop it, it's going to get him killed in Academia.<br><br>Gon and Yuya need to grow the fuck up.Dueling isn't about fun.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe but in yugioh winning = better human being, therefore Crow is a better human than Gon.</br>  <br>You should add some  Blackwings .</br>  <br>Because it was some awful shilling. How could Pendulum Synchro lose to plain old Synchro? I thought Konami respected shilling as an art form, this was just pathetic and I'm starting to lose all confidence in Konami's shills.</br>  <br><br>Gon winning accomplishes nothing in the story aside from jacking him off. Their objective is to look for strong duelists in synchro dimension. Crow beat Gon that qualifies him as strong enough to become an ally. It also shows his honor being his potential demise.</br></br>  <br>it was not old syncro, it was limit over accel syncro</br>  <br>If you haven't gathered that Standard outside of Reiji is the weakest dimension regardless of Pendulum Summoning then you haven't been paying attention. Hell I'm pretty sure it's been made of note at some point that Synchro is the strongest dimension.</br>  <br>Blackwings&gt;Pendulum Synchro<br>BUY BLACKWINGS KIDS</br></br>  Why was Dennis so expressive about Gongenzaka loss when he is the double agent?  <br>DON'T BELIEVE HIS LIES</br>  <br>Gotta keep that cover.</br>  <br> Crow only wins due to a standard weapon: action cards <br> Standard is weak <br>Then again I'm not sure how action cards how are a weapon when it won't take long for the opponents to realise they can use them too.</br></br></br>  <br>He was alone in his room</br>  <br>Remove bennis</br>  <br>True summoning&gt;Reiji's bootlegs<br><br>He had fun with Gon chan</br></br></br>  I love this meme how Arc-V is suddenly shit because unbeatable THE MAN was defeated by someone who wasn't MC  <br>Maybe cameras, maybe he didnt expect synchro to be this strong</br>  So Gongenzaka lost, so what?<br><br>Let's talk about Yuzu, she hasn't dueled in like ages it seems.</br></br>  <br>Despite being a double agent, he probably likes most of the lancers.</br>  <br>Two young, fit duelists arrive in a place that is completely unknown to them, separated from their friends and not knowing anyone else, they have to rely on each other for their very survival, and eventually, for comfort....<br><br>Just kidding, it's a plot hole or foreshadowing that Dennis is starting to mellow out and iwll have second thoughts about proceeding with whatever academia's plan for him is.</br></br></br>  Sweet Mami.    mami a fat  Mami-san!  <br>How dare you.</br>  Mami a pedo.  <br> pedo <br>She's motherly.</br></br>    Bunny Mami  <br>I want Mami to be the mother of my children!</br>  <br>Lewdist.</br>  <br>Is this lewd?</br>  If I were Mami's boyfriend, she'd never get hurt!  <br><br> http://exhentai.org/g/816593/d718bc<wbr>8508/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/769373/a26954<wbr>549a/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/766399/48cb3a<wbr>733c/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/625132/85950a<wbr>0fdf/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/586299/26e919<wbr>15e2/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/690655/1eebfa<wbr>a88c/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/402980/95f1da<wbr>1c9a/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/821425/4e80cf<wbr>239a/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/783546/9314bd<wbr>2df5/<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/807157/904922<wbr>c663/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/569644/fcad5f<wbr>8e3a/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/546152/3dfb6e<wbr>b8aa/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/551548/d29473<wbr>fd39/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/487765/a7d5e6<wbr>684a/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/445360/4c43e8<wbr>aa94/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/375859/d33c11<wbr>17eb/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/368116/61aeb1<wbr>77d6/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/801206/4f6cb8<wbr>0b75/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/687914/5b3b1c<wbr>ae00/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/702128/cbc4ed<wbr>0f83/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/778644/c685ca<wbr>59f0/</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr> </br></br>    Will Mami ever get a happy ending?    <br>Implying Homura didn't give them all happy endings at the end of Rebellion.</br>  Mami an Alice.  <br>nice tumblr nose</br>  Alpha Mumi  <br>Now you have to loop this as long as you have thread open.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pAw<wbr>R6w2TgxY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Tanuki Mami best Mami.          <br>Not bad.</br>  Boring thread.  <br>Puffy vulva.</br>  <br>Nagisa's hair<br><br><br>Nothing happening, like usual.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Have a cup of tea.</br>  <br><br>Make it more exciting for me!</br></br>  <br/>  This thread is totally headlesss    <br>Like this?</br>    <br>No, I already watched Shimoneta.

What else have I missed? Last time I paid attention to things the Sonoko LN was not out yet.</br>  <br>Well, it's a given that in the end, everything will be fire.</br>  So apparently Chikage is Middle school 2nd year. I thought Wakaba was a high schooler. They seem to be wearing same uniform though....    <br>Wakaba is also a 2nd year middle schooler.</br>  <br>she slightly looks a bit gothic too.</br>  <br>What are the runes telling?</br>  <br>Chikage isYuuna friend<br>japanese flower language for this flower is <br>情熱=Passion<br>独立=Independence<br>再会=Reunion<br>あきらめ=Don't give up<br>悲しい思い出=Sad memories<br>想うはあなた一人=The only one I love is you <br>また会う日を楽しみに= I am looking forward to being able to meet you someday<br><br>So yeah,everything confirm will be fire ;_;</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>dat forehead</br></br>  Any news about VN2 translations?  <br><br> legging <br> cardigan <br> black long hair <br> get along with Yuuna <br> important enough to get her info revealed after Wakaba <br>She's Tougou's ancestor, isn't she?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are these actual official comments, or just a blog talking about it? Since she's clearly got a gothic design and slightly dark backstory, the flower could easily just be because of that.</br>  <br>So, was my theory confirmed?<br>Is Takashima Yuuna same person as Yuuki Yuuna? Is this prequel generally one giant Yuuna's backstory, like Washio Sumi was Tougou's?</br></br>  <br>It's NoWaYu, not TaYuYu. There's bound to be some connection between our Yuuna and Takashima, but she'll likely only be a supporting character here so she can remain a little mysterious until the reveal. It'll be a breather until she's back in the main character seat when her story continues after all the set-up this is supposed to have.</br>  <br> The finale <br> Only Yuuna and Nogi are left alive <br> Yuuna gets warped 300 years into the future and arrives shortly before meeting Tougou for the first time <br> Yuuki is a new surname she chose for herself in a new world, deciding to be a courageous hero in memory of her dead comrades/love interest </br></br></br></br>  <br>How would they do it in inevitable anime adaptation? <br>Everyone would know from VA alone.</br></br>  <br>If they're the same person, I think it's more likely that our Yuuna is taking Takashima's role than the other way around, possibly during her coma.<br><br><br>I don't think an anime is inevitable. It's a multimedia project, so not every part of it is going to have a TV anime. The next animated part will probably be the next chapter in Yuuna's story, since we know that's still not over.</br></br></br></br>  I remember everyone going about how s2 is inevitable, but there hasn't been any news, has there?  <br>because the studio has entire year overburdened with other stuff and projects and shit that they agreed to before YuYuYu's success <br><br>anyway, I just want to see WaSuYu animated. If much less selling anime can get movies, why can't this franchise either?</br></br></br>  <br>The novel is supposed to have lots of world-building that will become important in the future, and they've said that there's still more to tell in Yuuna's story. It's a pretty solid bet outside of there suddenly being a rights squabble or something.</br>  <br>The totally gay Vita game, VN2, and the Yuusha-bu discover Nogi Wakaba's diary LN chapter.</br>  I wonder how I got through this series when I can't stand yuribait.  <br> If much less selling anime can get movies, why can't this franchise either? <br><br>Late anime at the 9k range or below mostly get recap movies. I think they're just being careful with how they go with the franchise that's all.</br></br></br>  <br>In the anime, they're way less gay than, say, NanoFate; it's in all the other material that they turn it up to 11.</br>  <br>Yeah, I noticed that the extra stuff is pretty yuribait heavy. I still would've preferred a bad ending but I guess happy ones are ok too.</br>  <br><br>It isn't bait, if you're just going to say this I don't recommend you to continue with the series.</br></br>  <br>Wait, it really is Yuri? Well shit, abandon fucking ship.</br>  <br>Tougou has been officially confirmed to be in love with Yuuna.</br>  <br>It's just a crush that goes nowhere.</br>  <br>It's going places, specially if played the Vita game you know this.</br>  <br>Wait, so do you dislike yuri or yuribait?<br><br>And yeah, most the gay is really in the extra stuff. After those the anime is practically disappointing. It's mostly general magical girl show everyone is gay for the MC stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>She's going to ruin everything isn't she?</br>  <br>Yuuna's just dense. After all, none of her reactions to getting a love letter from a girl were "b-but that's forbidden love", she just has an inferiority complex the size of the sun.</br>  <br> Yuuna's just dense <br>Meaning it goes nowhere.</br></br>  <br>Does anyone honestly think they're ever going to show them getting together? At best we're going to have NanoFate levels of knowing interaction while never actually confirming anything.</br>  <br>I avoid yuri but can watch yuribait if I build up enough resistance before hand. I can just pretend it's just some stupid girl crush.</br>  <br>Ah. Wishing I hadn't asked now.</br>  <br>The anime has plenty of it, you just need to know where to search.<br><br>It's just that unlike the VN and the Vita game, the anime had a plot to follow, so they couldn't focus on it 100% of the time, but it was there.<br><br><br>Well, you can't pretend that here.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You bet your ass I can.</br>  Gakkou Gurashi thread<br><br>I just watched the first episode. <br><br>Holy.

I'm just getting around to watching the third episode now, and I have to say that I am absolutely loving the compression artifacts in this scene. Lerche is really putting a good amount of flair into this adaptation.  <br>The music score in this scene was great, too.</br>  read the manga instead<br>also once the anime starts the threads went to shit</br>  <br> AOTY <br>no is a deconstruction and AOTD</br></br>  <br> I've been on /a/ going on 3 years now and I still don't understand what a fucking "secondary" is. <br>Oh no, I'm not falling for this one.</br></br>  <br> being a newfag </br>  It seems like this show came straight from one of those write an anime plot threads.  Is this supposed to be a metaphor for her being in the basement as a zombie? Or are they going full-on anime original and she is actually alive and alone going crazy in the basement while the girls are upstairs?  <br>you just did.</br>  <br><br>Okay</br></br>  <br> Is this supposed to be a metaphor for her being in the basement as a zombie? <br>Yes. At least that's how I saw it.</br></br>  <br>Why does she not have her ponytail here?</br>    <br>Is this anime bonus or manga bonus. If its the latter, can we at least have an anime only thread for once.</br>  <br><br> a metaphor for her being in the basement as a zombie? <br><br>What does that even mean?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It means read the manga.</br>  It's literally the best zombie story I've ever read, which isn't really saying very much since all zombie stories are unmitigated fucking trash and it looks like this one is heading in the same bullshit retarded area with the university story arc. Oh no! It is humans who are the true monsters and we shall illustrate this with idiotic biker gangs and cannibals!  <br> I've been on /a/ going on x years now <br>everytime</br></br>  <br> Is this supposed to be a metaphor for her being in the basement as a zombie? <br>Nah, it was just a convenient place to write her diary so that they others wouldn't find out.</br></br>  <br>But earlier in the episode (and in the manga) it shows her writing her diary in the destroyed staff room, also with her ponytail cut off.</br>  <br>Her hair is inconsistent as fuck even in the manga.</br>  <br><br>I've been reading the manga, I'm asking how that could possibly be a metaphor. I don't think you know what that word means.</br></br>  <br> If its the latter, can we at least have an anime only thread for once. <br>lol<br><br><br>Metaphor's not the right word, but you know what he means.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.google.com/search?q=def<wbr>ine:metaphor<br> a thing regarded as representative or symbolic of something else, especially something abstract. <br><br>I mean, it isn't an allegory or analogy, and metaphor is one level down from those two words, so I chose it.</br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br> But earlier in the episode (and in the manga) it shows her writing her diary in the destroyed staff room, also with her ponytail cut off. <br>But she can only write in the staff room by day. At night that place is dangerous. The basement on the other hand is a safe place to write at night.</br></br>  <br><br>What would be the right word to replace "metaphor" in that sentence then?<br><br><br>The zombies become less active at night, right?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>they go back home then go back to school in the morning.</br>  <br>Yeah, going through the bottom 2 floors full of zombies at night is way safer thann staying in the staff room behind their barricades!</br>  <br>What would make the staff room dangerous at night then?</br>  <br>Megu-nee and Shovel probably killed off the teachers.</br>  <br>So how would that make the staff room dangerous at night?</br>  <br>We don't know if there were zombies in the bottom floors at the time. Besides, Miki found Megu-nee's diary in the library, so this couldn't be the last time Megu-nee was in the basement. Otherwise her diary would have been there, not in the library.</br>  <br>why would you want the staff room to be dangerous at night?</br>  <br>Fly, you fool! These threads are a spoiler trove!</br>  <br><br>Either you're an anime only fag, or you're just retarded. Megu-nee would never go down to the basement on her own just to write in her diary. The plan was to relocate everyone down there once things were safe.<br><br> Besides, Miki found Megu-nee's diary in the library <br>No, she didn't. It was in their sleeping room on the third floor. And Megu-nee never went to the shelter in the manga except for right as she was turning.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You're wrong because I think the anime is a 1:1 adaptation. <br>Maybe she started a new diary now that she's locked herself in the basement? Documenting her last moments before fully turning.</br></br>  <br><br>No one's going to spoil him about shovel getting infected or Megu-ne being dead all along.</br></br>  <br>Because you (assuming you're the same person replying to me this whole time) said it would be: <br> At night that place is dangerous. </br></br>  <br>Think what you want man. Whatever helps you sleep at night.</br>  <br><br>If they go anime original on this, that's fine. But if that's the case, we still don't have enough context to explain why she was in the basement in that scene.</br></br>  <br>megu-nee was obvious as fuck. You should've been able to put that together by the end of the first episode if you recall how miki acts.</br>  <br>he probably thinks that it's harder to spot zombies at night.</br>  There are 2 Megu-nees.  <br><br>Yeah, a worse spoiler would've been like if someone mentioned how the guy in the helicopter finds Yuki's balloon picture about how they're at the school and goes to help them but then has a hand spasm from his latent zombie infection and breaks his anti-zombie medicine vial, causing him to decide to just crash his helicopter instead so the girls are left back where they started.</br></br>  <br>That does explain all the hair inconsistencies.</br>  <br> hand spasm <br>I thought that he got to the school, didn't see any survivors, and simply gave up hope, destroying the vial and succumbing to the virus.<br>The whole segment seemed kind of odd.<br><br>Also when Rin and Yuki are trying to make it from the school to the underground bunker and the see a figure of a woman, but at the next page its the entrance to the bunker, what was that suppose to be about? Was the woman megu-nee's spirit or something leading them to safety?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Seriously? How are people not getting the pilot scene this badly?</br>    <br> I thought that he got to the school, didn't see any survivors, and simply gave up hope, destroying the vial and succumbing to the virus. <br><br>I don't know what drugs you're taking to get something so wrong but you probably should stop taking them.</br></br></br>  <br>That was Rii starting to hallucinate. It's amazing how with all the foreshadowing in this series some people still don't know what's going on.</br>    <br><br><br>How the fuck can anyone misinterpret this?</br></br></br>  <br>Now imagine the hand is Kurumi's and the syringe is your dick.</br>  <br>The previous chapter ended with someone on the radio begging for someone to respond. I assumed it was helicopter-chan who was becoming more desperate and unstable</br>   sending the infected to pilot your valuable "get anywhere" machine.   <br>He's flying normally, showing no signs of despair, then in panel 3 we see his hand trembling, panel 4 has a very sudden crushing of the note as signified by the way the sound effect is written, then he gives a disconcerted look at his hand while sweating through his mask.<br><br><br>He then reaches for the syringe and prepares it, hands trembling all the while, and suddenly crushes it with his zombie hand.<br><br><br>If he was crushing it in despair, why would he be preparing it for injection?<br><br><br>And why did I post those images and write this up if someone already has an image for it? Fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He was probably the last helicopter pilot they had.</br>  <br> he will soon zombify <br>He was infected but we don't know for sure it was the zombie virus.</br></br>  <br><br> He was infected but we don't know for sure it was the zombie virus. <br><br>What else would it be?</br></br></br></br>  <br>There are three viruses, you know.</br>  <br>Japanese cold</br>  <br>Even if he was, they could literally have put even an infant child in there to stick him with a needle when he starts getting zombie shakes instead of having him go alone.</br>  <br> can we at least have an anime only thread for once </br>  What caused all the explosions?  <br>I don't think you understand that the way they did it was supposed to show to you, the reader, that they are in very dire straights and don't have literal infant children to spare for needle duty. They're stretched that thin.</br>  <br> literally <br><br>Furthermore, infants can't use needles, and they don't have any infants available.</br></br></br>  <br>I can't fathom how you'd come to that conclusion. He claims he's looking for survivors, asks if anyone can hear him, and tells them to respond. I don't know how you could think that makes him sound desperate and unstable.</br>  <br>Zombies.</br>  <br>Infected people driving, turning, and being incredibly bad at driving.<br><br>I'd like to think that it's the stereotype of asian women being horrible drivers, and the zombie influence amplifying it.</br></br></br>  Filename    <br>It's out there somewhere.</br>  <br>You might be interested in tacking these onto those, mostly for the volume 2 and 3 pages: https://archive.moe/a/thread/110038<wbr>396/#110038641<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/109993<wbr>809/<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/112097<wbr>001/<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/112999<wbr>146/#113004805<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128388<wbr>151/#128412672</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br>  Chapter 38 when? Also, first in thread for wanting to fuck Kurumi and Miki between their thighs  <br> this anime <br> &gt;we want the walking dead audience </br></br>  <br>I wonder if they're going to introduce mutants at some point, like a Tyrant or a Licker. That would be pretty cool.</br>  <br>If it saves Kurumi then I'm all for it.</br>   every zombie censored to fuck <br>dropped</br>  <br>That would be fucking retarded.

Let's say they hit the town at the same time. A fast-acting (mostly) non-lethal airborne/contact strain that cripples you up very quickly, and the regular zombie strain.<br><br>The first strain knocked out and crippled a sizeable chunk of the town very quickly making them easy-pickings for the zombie strain, giving it enough of a foothold to be effective.<br><br>Because of the earlier outbreak in the 60s, though, anyone whose parents or grandparents survived that could have a natural resistance to the milder strain (which is how the girls survived). They could however still be carriers.<br><br>When the military discovered the note, they were very cautious, with full haz-mat suits, etc. and the note is clearly bagged. However later we see the pilot handling the note outside the bag. THAT'S when he was infected (with the fast-acting mild strain).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Mad Max <br> The Raid </br>  Based on the school map, is School Life Club in LL room on the 3rd floor? <br><br>Why is there "classroom 1, classroom 2" etc on the 1st floor while there is 1-A, 1-B and so on (I presume they are classrooms as well)?</br></br>  <br>But why are the other guys afraid of these three girls?</br>  <br> gook <br>Why? I can read a bit of moon but I ain't learning yet another language just for that.</br></br>  <br>I bet the quiet one's a zombie.</br>  <br>They were never shown to be fearing the girls, as far as I remember. The gate just prevented them from getting access to the uni.</br>  <br>Things like 1-A would be homerooms.</br>  <br>Dunno, it's not like they can't overpower a bunch of weak looking girls. Doesn't appear to be anything stopping the biker guys or crossbow-kun from taking over their place. Maybe they just don't want to or feel the need to.</br>  <br>I see. Never really thought of it as sometimes homeroom seems to be in the same classroom. What about where School Life's club room? Is it LL room?</br>  <br><br><br>The panel translation said they're upholding discipline as the top priority. That would be a reason to avoid fighting other locals.</br></br></br>  <br>And a group of people, ready to chase strangers in cars, are just going to leave another group, good 50m from their hideout alone, simply because they closed the gates. Doesn't sound plausible.</br>  <br>Seems like an effective method to keep the whole thing in order. Stay calm inside your group, strike down and loot everyone who comes your way.</br>  SO the three college girls are innocent?<br><br>I can trust them now right? The conspiracy is bullshit right?</br></br>  <br>I think that's more related to their attitude towards zombies, considering the context and the worried look Miki gives Kurumi.</br>  <br>Cannibals</br>  <br> dropping your guard because you were given vidya and entertainment <br>Probably the WORST thing to do in such a situation. Anon confirmed for looted, raped, and eaten/killed</br></br>  <br>So basically that panel says they have zero tolerance for zombies?</br>  <br> WRECK <br> WRECK 2 <br> no WRECK 3 <br>They have good taste.<br> How's REC 4? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon, where are you getting the scans? My usual korean rune site still has it up to chapter 37.</br>  <br>http://marumaru.in/b/manga/336</br>  <br>Thanks, m8.</br>  <br>Obviously. The writer's not a hack, so we're getting human drama, not a cartoon villain.<br><br><br>I don't think I've seen any of the context posted in Japanese yet, but it makes sense since they're clearly talking about zombies and Miki looks at Kurumi with a worried expression.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They look surprised about the zombie manual that belonged to Megu nee.<br><br>Looks like the college didn't have any of the zombie manuals around so the college girls didn't think there could be a government conspiracy involved.</br></br></br>  <br>In the anime, it's marked Student Council, and the kanji matches the student council planning room on the third floor in the map. They sleep in a resource room/reference room, which is next to class D on each floor. <br><br>I haven't checked the manga version but it's probably the same.</br></br></br>   alcohol and drunken college girls <br><br>The tragedy repeats itself.</br></br>  <br>Fucking sluts will corrupt my pure Gurashis and Kurumi.</br>  <br> The writer's not a hack, <br>I'm no so sure. This is all pretty standard zombie flick shit right now.</br></br>  <br>Make sense seeing the path Yuki takes in the 1st episode after waking up where she walks past the classrooms.<br><br>Any idea whats the double circle icons on the maps?</br></br></br>  <br> pure Gurashis and Kurumi <br>What are you implying here?</br></br>    <br>Good lord<br><br>I need this in my life</br></br></br>  <br>fire extinguisher</br>  <br>Thanks again.</br>  <br> all that good taste <br>and you people say college sluts are evil</br></br>  Who's a Mikifag here?  <br>He's implying she's purer than the others.</br>  <br>It's Yuki for me. Sorry.</br>  <br>Is the last one supposed to be a parody of a specific movie?</br>  <br><br><br>No more words, all girls reporting in.</br></br></br>  <br> 3rd generation potato </br>  3cute5me  Confrimed death flag.<br><br>One will die for sure.</br></br>  <br>It would have been more realistic if it was also in portrait mode.</br>  <br><br><br> noone likes rii </br></br></br>  So I guess this means they're just gonna be fucking around for a while doing "club" activities for the next few chapters until shit gets fucked again.  <br>Third girl who nobody cares about will  live. </br>  <br>kurumi sleeps naked?</br>  <br>So what did the girls say about the teddy bear?</br>  <br>  implying </br>  <br>Sleep clothes.</br>  <br> Shovel sleeping with Shovel <br> Yuki wants a Megu-nee daki <br> Miki is content just by knowing they are next to her <br><br>And let's not talk about the other... two nutcases.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think they know it's Rii's imouto yet. At least going by the panels.</br>  <br>These uni-sluts have supreme taste.<br><br>10/10 would want to hang around with during apocalypse</br></br></br>  <br> introducing alcohol to the gurashis <br>I'm hoping for a slow death through zombie mutilation for these sluts.</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure it's this. The font matches close enough.</br>  <br>The uni girls seem to have been inspired by them to do something more than just play games. I just hope Kurumi's superpowers are up to keeping all of them alive.</br>  <br>Best uni-sluts.</br>  Does this show have yuri?  <br>This movie surely didn't disappoint. The sequel stretches the story too much.</br>  <br>Just a bit of subtext between Kurumi and Miki. Very minimal.</br>  <br>Did her pantsu evolve?</br>  <br>It'll probably still be a while before any more despair happens though.</br>  <br>who's making the newspaper?</br>  <br>The last one is<br> 武技人間 <br> Bugi Ningen <br> Martial Arts Human <br>No idea on the specific pun/reference.<br><br> It's probably obvious and I'm dumb. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Local girls are not fine. They're not fine at all.</br>  <br>Of course not, see the top right corner.</br>  <br>nice</br>  This is sorta Japanese I am legend?  <br>I think the girls being cannibals would make for some pretty cool drama.<br>Think of what they did in The Last of Us with the cannibals, who were pretty much the most together bunch of people we get to see and yet they're still fucking cannibals out to eat the main characters (remember, even the other cannibals are fed up with their crazy lolicon boss).<br><br> inb4 hurr Western shit durr </br></br></br></br>  <br>show me Warhammer and then we'll talk</br>  <br>more like the walking dead.</br>  <br> not wanting to fuck the PTSD out of Rii <br> not wanting to hug her and tell her everything's going to be diejoubu </br></br>  <br>It's not sustainable and they've clearly got a sufficient stockpile or supply of snacks and beer. In a story focused on grounded psychological drama, it'd make no sense and be introduced solely for shock value.</br>  <br>The best mix</br>  <br>Kurumi would like to play Space Marine.<br><br>Replacechainsword with shovel, and Captain Titus is basically Kurumi</br></br></br>  <br>It can't be Japanese Walking Dead.<br>It's actually good.<br>And the writers don't introduce useless characters only to kill them off all the time.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to have wild orgies with all those uni-sluts.<br><br>Damn, they should be starved for cocks.</br></br></br>  <br> Its like you're basically telling Nana is fucking her manager. <br>that's what college sluts are for.</br></br>  <br>Makes me think of that joke about how to make a child cry twice.<br><br> You wipe the blood off your cock on their teddy bear. </br></br></br>  <br>Just because you eat humans when the food supply gets low doesn't mean you sustain yourself exclusively on humans.<br>I'm almost certain the college girls did SOMETHING nasty to survive, no matter what that was. Maybe that's why they're being so nice now. Maybe they, and I can't believe I'm writing this, left someone for dead in order to escape the Zombies and now they're trying to make amends.</br></br>  <br>Get out of here Kawady Max.</br>  <br>The whole point is that they've sat inside playing video games and hiding from reality instead of actually trying to do anything.</br>  <br> implying they haven't already given up on guys and are rigorously enjoying their new-found lesbianism <br><br> inb4 implying they wouldn't still straddle the nearest living dick they can find <br>true dat</br></br></br></br>  <br> left someone for dead in order to escape the Zombies and now they're trying to make amends. <br>They already used that plot with Megu-nee, I doubt they'll do it again. Unless it's some form of pottery.</br></br>   3eps in <br><br>booooooooring</br></br>  <br>That's more Rii for myself.</br>  <br>doesn't mean there wasn't someone they threw to the wolves to do it. <br><br>Having three morally good new characters who will continue to be part of the group is very unlikely, is all I'm saying.</br></br></br>  <br>They're involved in soccer, remember their homes and care for each other. So basically yes. Yet Kurumi slays them, which means she's the real monster. The zombies just want to happily live their undead life.</br>  <br>There's literally nothing between those two. Miki is teased often with Yuki, though.</br>  <br> mangafox </br>  <br>Read the manga.</br>  <br>  </br>  <br>That means I could enjoy that dead life after I die too?</br>  <br>Cute zombies doing cute things when?</br>  Megu-nee is for ____  <br>Pretty much every character so far has been basically good. Even the bear-murdering crossbow bullies are just scared. It's not a good-versus-evil kind of story.<br><br>Also, it doesn't really fit with their conversation about how the School Life Club had been going through hardship while they had just been messing around.</br></br></br>  <br>But anon we already have a cute zombie doing cute things.</br>  <br>I wonder if it's as simple as that and this arc will be some kinda "temptation of a false paradise" arc like in old fantasy tales and such.</br>  If anyone interested in more extras I have something for you. The original author actually has another twitter account - @nk12_netabare - where he post spoilers, I guess. <br><br>So last September he has written here some of his thoughts about the Gakkou Gurashi! manga. You can consider this an Afterword 4.5<br><br>『がっこうぐらし！』において、ゆきたち四人が肩を寄せ合うように暮らす日<wbr>常は、孤独なものです。それもそのはず、ゆきたちの知る限り、この世界には<wbr>生きた人間の姿が失われているのです。<br>代わりにいるのは、歩く死者たち。朽ちかけた制服を着た、かつてのクラスメ<wbr>ートが、虚ろな目をしたまま動いています。既に命はなくとも、心はなくとも<wbr>、かつての日常を偲ばせるように、学園内を闊歩しているのです。<br>その姿は単にもの悲しいだけではなく、危険でもあります。その「歩く死」は<wbr>感染するのです。彼らは人に反応し、傷つけ、喰らい、そうして同族を増やし<wbr>ているのです。<br>この事態がどこまで広がっているのか。校内だけなのか。あるいは市外、県内<wbr>なのか。もしかしたら日本中。あるいは世界全体。ゆきたちには知るよしはあ<wbr>りません。<br>それでもゆきたちは、生きており、生きているからにはそこには日常があるの<wbr>です。悲しみや苦しみだけでなく、笑顔も希望もある日常。それが「がっこう<wbr>ぐらし！」の物語です。<br>そんなわけで、「がっこうぐらし！」は、いわゆるゾンビ物の作品となります<wbr>。ゾンビが大量発生して、社会が崩壊した中で、サバイバルをする女子高生た<wbr>ちです。<br>(cont.)</br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Teasing!<br>She is a good girl!</br></br>  <br>Hika doesn't like armed factions. She probably killed all kinds of thugs.</br>  <br>(cont.)<br>一口にゾンビ物の作品と言っても、実は非常に幅が広いのですが、ぱっと思い<wbr>つくのは、血飛沫やらモツやらが飛び散る系のバトルアクション物でしょうか<wbr>。 個人的には大好物なんですが、「がっこうぐらし！」はちょっと違う路線です<wbr>。<br>タイトルの通り、「学校」での「暮らし」。女の子達の非日常な冒険（も多少<wbr>入りますが、それ）よりも、過ぎ去ってゆく日常。精一杯生きていく営み。そ<wbr>の中で起きる、心を震わす様々なことを描けたらな、と、思っています。<br>その中に、楽しんでいただけるように、色々な工夫を凝らしましたので、ゾン<wbr>ビを好きな方も、よく知らない方も、面白そうだと思われた方も、変なマンガ<wbr>だと思われた方も、是非、お手にとってご覧になっていただければと思います<wbr>。<br>内容紹介ということで、色々と賢しらなことを書きましたが、つらい時から楽<wbr>しい時、またつらい時まで、刻々と変わる千葉サドルさんの描く、女の子の表<wbr>情、仕草ときたら、本当にすごいことになっておりますので、表紙にピンと来<wbr>られたら、ぜひぜひお手にとってくださいませ！<br><br>So yeah, it would be great if somebody could translate (and maybe typeset) this stuff too.</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Hallucinating about.</br>  <br>She was probably raped by them.</br>  <br>I do. Same to you, but I'll add the words "and pay attention this time".<br><br><br>Literally not gay at all. Miki was freaking out because Kurumi has a death wish. Kurumi calmed her down. Kurumi's not even gay.<br><br>Also this is the only thing anyone ever posts. Why? Because it's the only thing, and it's not even romantic. Like at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think if you rub your dick on Rii's teddy bear, she's gonna murder you for defiling her sister.</br>  <br>I've been wondering, is there also such thing as tertiaries?</br>  <br>More like they drove her off and tried to kill her when she got bitten.</br>  <br>Just read the manga.</br>  What careers would the Gurashis have went into if the zombie apocalypse didn't happen?  <br>Or maybe was an ex-member until something happened and she left.<br><br><br>  </br></br></br></br>  <br>Filthy quinary.</br>  <br>If that's you're only response I'm actually convinced all you've seen is that hand holding image repeatedly in these threads and never read the context behind it.<br><br>I hate what an anime airing does to a fanbase. Fuckin delusional shit eaters.</br></br></br>  <br>More like Bromance.</br>  So how do the uni girls have power? Solar panels too?  <br>Just read the manga.</br>  <br>That supposed to be evidence? The moment immediately afterward when Rii confronts them for being out late and they're embarrassed because it's only Yuki who ever gets scolded?</br>    <br>Animeonly fags, everyone.</br>  <br>Miki: Host club<br>Kurumi: Athlete manager<br>Rii: Kindergarden teacher<br>Yuki: WcDonalds</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Wow buddy. You know, he's right. There's been more Miki/Yuki development than anything and if  is all it takes for you to be convinced about romantic development, than I fear for your love life.</br></br>  <br>Yes. I assume the uni is also one of the many fallout shelters that Randall Co. built.</br>  <br>Bromance is basically wild monkey sex for yurifags.</br>  <br>You should try reading the manga.</br>  <br>This was also related to Kurumi's death wish. She made light of the situation to try and make Miki not worry, which is indeed unfair.</br>  <br>Kurumi is so cute with her fangs.</br>  I've been wondering; in the anime some girls made fun of Yuki's hat, yet she kept wearing it.<br><br>Do you think that hat has some kind of story behind it? It'd explain why Yuki wears it everyday. Maybe I just want a backstory so the hat isn't just there for the moe factor, like the backpack with wings.</br></br>  <br>Well of course there's more Yuki/Miki because Kurumi/Miki is just now starting. Same for Yuki/Yuuri.</br>  <br>Fuck off. That got old 4 posts ago and I already proved I have, unlike you.</br>  <br>You didn't look at the gook pictures, did you?<br><br><br> I fear for your love life <br>Did you get lost on the way to facebook? I pity the sucker who isn't a virgin.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you even read? In that scene Miki was worried about Rii and Ru. It had nothing to do with Kurumi's situation.</br>  <br> gotten </br>  <br>Why must you ruin my day?</br>  <br>But that's wrong, you piece of shit.</br>  ITT: people who are so desperate for Kurumi to get some loving before she dies that they're delusional.  <br>She just thinks it's cute and it probably used to be considered cute but now it isn't. She's attached, though, and refuses to go back on her fashion sense.<br><br><br>Sorry, I thought this page followed the one where Miki told her not to do anything silly. That's my bad.<br><br>Though in that case it's still completely not romantic.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> delusional <br>Why is it that people who use this word are usually colossally butthurt faggots?</br></br>  <br> Though in that case it's still completely not romantic. <br>There's no romance in this series, but the way Kurumi and Miki support each other is the closest to it.</br></br>  <br>That would be like people who've only watched the current Arslan anime.<br><br>i.e. an anime adaptation of the manga adaptation of the novels</br></br></br>  <br>It is delusion though: shipping a proven straight girl with a dubiously gay girl because of one page in which they held hands for completely not romantic reasons.</br>  There must be some reason for the hat, and why Yuki becomes marginally more competent with it off.  <br> gay girl <br>And you talk about delusions.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, maybe you're right. I still think something happened or will happen, pretty much until the point I see promotional art of the four gurashis and the college girls together.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128618715   <br> That picture <br>It makes sense.<br><br>Too much sense, I'd say.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What's that in her hand?</br>  <br>I asked why you're a colossally butthurt faggot, not why you don't agree with him. Is it autism? Only an autist could take this seriously.</br>  <br>I should make a collage of all the times Miki hints that she might be developing feelings for Yuki. It's not really reciprocated, but after I think the fifth blush or so I had to take notice.<br><br>EVEN THEN I didn't take that as a sign that romance will EVER happen in this series, and more likely those blushes are out of embarrassed respect because Miki used to think very little of Yuki before Yuki proved to be incredible.<br><br><br> dubiously <br>Literally, literally saying "doubtful gay" in the same post.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's a symbol meant to show her delusions. That's why it's off at the end of the OP.</br>  <br>I'm justifiably butthurt since delusional yuri shipping is a cancer. Seriously. Make fun of me all you like, you know it's true.</br>  <br>Her true love, shovel-kun<br><br><br>That's not me you're replying to, there's more than one person in this thread that thinks you're full of shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure he might be legit autistic considering he was incapable of telling people were making fun of him.</br>  <br>You're delusional anon. No one is developing feelings for anyone. Miki just gets embarrassed at Yuki not giving a damn about her personal boundaries.</br>  <br>Waiting for Yuki to bit the neck of a guy.</br>  <br>So you are the mentally ill shitposter who's been ruining threads about a bunch of shows.</br>  <br> delusional yuri shipping is a cancer <br>You're right. You're a cancer.</br></br>  <br>Oh please, "merely pretending"? You think you're clever?<br><br><br>Nah, I actually thought the denial of yuri in Hibike was bullshit. I an a yurifag, I can't stand delusion though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tell me about Yuki. Why does she wear the hat?</br>  <br>I acknowledged it's probably not romantic in my post you twat.<br><br>Also she doesn't get physical often in the manga. Most blushes are caused when talking to or about Yuki.</br></br></br>  Is Rii a predator?<br><br>As soon as Yuki starts becoming more independent and mature, Rii ditches her for another young girl.</br></br>  <br>That makes no sense, you idiot. Think a little before you post.</br>  <br>No one here actually thinks they're getting together though, it is merely funposting and you're getting assblasted over nothing.</br>  <br> I acknowledged it's probably not romantic in my post you twat. <br>You clearly said Miki is developing feeling. You're delusional, but if you want to keep up this nonsense, be my guest. You're clearly too far gone by now anyway.</br></br>  <br>It was pretty clear at least some of the people were fucking with you.</br>  <br>It actually make a lost of sense.</br>  <br>I'll give you the benefit of the doubt<br><br>With a few notable exceptions, the original format is better at expressing the author's intent. When adapted to another format, (eg: Manga, Anime, Live Action, etc...), often something is lost in the process. Whether it's due to censorship, negative alterations to the story, or just things that don't translate well between formats, the secondary format can be seen as inferior in one sense. Of course that doesn't stop the adaption from improving in other areas, eg: actually having audio, expanding on certain events, etc.<br><br>Additionally, adaptions may contain references to things that were cut, or foreshadowing to later events that would not be as enjoyable without having read the original first.<br><br>Those who learn of a series via one of its adaptions and have not seen the original, (Secondaries), miss out on some of what the original had to offer. <br>Combine that with the somewhat hipster attitude that /a/ seems to pride itself on, and you can see why "Secondary" would be used as an insult:<br><br> There's a thing I was into before it was mainstream. <br> You show up around the time the undesirable types of people that mainstream shows are known to attract normally appear. <br> Not only did you only get into this after it went mainstream, you're not even enjoying it properly. <br> You're enjoying (what I perceive to be) a watered down version of it. <br> Worse still, you then felt a need to tell everyone on the internet this. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>"Funposting" causes less and less people to realize you're "funning". Since the anime aired, threads have tended to have an increase in "I want yuri doujins!" posts and "shovel/miki otp" posts and I know from experience here that the more something is said the more likely it is to be eventually taken as truth.</br>  <br>You can't be a yurifag unless you accept that Miki is in love with both Yuki and Shovel. You'll have to kill yourself now.</br>  <br>I'd wish Rii would pray on me</br>  That's it. I want all of you to die.  Just marathoned through the whole manga.<br>Dammit, that radio girl<br> all that broadcast teasers <br> one page of portrait <br> then that door <br> then that letter <br>Now I'm just sad.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I said might then immediately followed with probably not.<br><br><br>Because I haven't claimed otps or "obvious" ships or anything? The one thing I said I quickly gave reason as to why it was probably bullshit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> pray <br>Is she religious too? I thought that was only Megu-nee.</br></br>  <br>I like actual yuri not yuri I make up in my head.</br>  <br>Perhaps</br>  <br> I know from experience here that the more something is said the more likely it is to be eventually taken as truth. <br>You're going to kill yourself today.</br></br>  <br>I have read this post several times now and I can't make any fucking sense of it.</br>  <br>The other guys have rigid discipline against zombies, meaning no infected allowed. The uni girls are not part of their group for some reason, and the guys avoided confrontation with them. At least one of the girls, probably Hika since she's so quiet and scared of the armed guys, must be infected already just like Kurumi, which will be a source of conflict, drama and death, but that doesn't mean any of them are evil.</br>  <br>Post the "we're on fire" one</br>  <br>That was a good one, even if you are denying the way 4chan works.</br>  <br>Please no.<br>The only reason RE and L4D had mutant zombies was because you ahve a fucking collection of guns and normal zombies barely poses any threat.<br>These girls have a hard time enough just staying sane with these "normal" masses</br></br></br>  <br>So you're insisting on filthy 3DPD and you reject the pure fantasy of 2D love?</br>  <br>Is English not your first language?</br>  Zombie/Rii OTP, doujins when?  <br>The way 4chan works is that you really will kill yourself today.</br>  <br>I do want at least a bigger and faster zombie at the end. The normal ones don't cut it anymore. Kurumi alone can kill like 20 of them right now.</br>  <br>There's just something about that "......", and her smug look that must have a deeper meaning.</br>  <br>wut<br><br>I read yuri series and tend to avoid "yuri" anime because often it's heavy teasing with no payoff. Hibike was the worst example. Even my sister knew those two were dykes.</br></br></br>  <br>Dude, you had a good joke and now you're driving it into the ground with your next step. In fucking disappointed in you.<br><br>If you respond with the same thing I'll lose all the respect I gained for you from your quick quip.</br></br></br>  <br>The zombies aren't the source of conflict anymore, it's other survivors. Mutating zombies wold be terrible.</br>  <br>All 2D was made up in somebody's head, so only 3DPD would be actual. That means you're doing incest with your sister.</br>  <br>When the Greeks pay off their debts</br>  <br>It's not really about the zombies. If there's stronger ones all these kids would probably die.</br>  <br> Hibike <br> Teasing <br>Hibike had like the most natural relationship developments in years. If you're gonna cite something as teasing at least use shit like Sakura Trick or something.</br></br></br>  <br> it's other survivors <br>That's just in this arc. Once they move on to Randall things are going to change again.</br></br>  <br>I can't deny logic this airtight. I won't even mention stuff about "canon versus fan delusion", that's too good.</br>  <br>Sakura Trick had lesbians in a relationship that basically went nowhere. Hibiki had two girls declare their love for one another, obsess over each other, and had one touch another's lips very inappropriately. But, they were straight of course.</br>  <br>It's fine if you lose all respect, since you're going to kill yourself today, and it won't matter after that.<br><br><br>Unless Shovel is the mutating zombie and she becomes the final boss from the other group's perspective, ultimately leading to their deaths  just like that anon who's going to die today. </br></br></br></br>  <br>You know, I said "taken as truth" not "becomes truth".</br>  <br>Regarding "Gakkou Gurashi", the daily life of Yuki and her friends as they live on by lending each other their shoulders is a very lonely thing. As far as they can see, living humans have completely vanished from the face of the earth. In their place, the walking dead have risen. Without mind, without heart, but as if they somehow still recall their former daily lives, their former classmates shamble through the school, their eyes vacant and lifeless and their uniforms decaying on their bodies. Their figures are not merely tragic, but also perilous: these "walking dead" can infect others. They react to people, attack people, devour people, and in doing so add to their family. How far could this situation have spread? Just within the school? Throughout the city, throughout the prefecture, even throughout all of Japan? Or else, the entire world? Yuki and her friends have no idea.<br><br>But even so, they live on. They live on, and because of that, their daily lives continue - daily lives filled not only with grief and hardship, but also with hope and laughter. That is what kind of story "Gakkou Gurashi" is.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>And so, you might call it a zombie story. After all, it's set in a world where society has collapsed after a massive zombie outbreak, and a group of high school girls must try to survive. But even if you try to sum it up with just the word "zombie", in truth that's an amazingly ambiguous category. Since it has blood and guts flying around, perhaps it's some kind of gory battle-action story? Personally, I quite like those, but I think "Gakkou Gurashi" is a little different. Just as the title says, it's about "life" at "school". The girls go on out-of-the-ordinary adventures (well, I might be kind of understating that), but more than that, it's about the way they pass their daily lives, doing their very best to live on. I thought that I'd depict various events and ways their hearts tremble during those daily lives. And so within that, I came up with all kind of ideas so that all kinds of readers, from people who enjoy zombies to people who know nothing about them, from people who think it looks interesting to people who think it looks like a weird manga, would be able to pick it up and enjoy it. Anyway, for a story introduction I've said a lot of impertinent things already, but from the hard times to the fun times all the way until the next hard times, Sadoru Chiba's artwork depicting the moment-by-moment changes in the girls' expressions and actions is really amazing, so please, if the front cover caught your eye, pick it up and take a look!</br></br></br>    <br>Once you take it as truth it can easily become truth.</br>  <br><br>Good summary from the author.

Im not risking my pathetic life to save some random girl.</br>  <br>No, I meant people filming in vertical mode.</br>  Save her and get killed by the car so I can hang out with Botan.  <br>That's nice, a few years ago we had a truck running over a 10 year old girl here. Her head was caught up in the wheel and her entire head above the lower jaw disappeared. She was walking with her grandmother who wasn't injured, I wonder what goes through a person at moments like these.</br>   Slam on the break as not to hit the loli <br> start honking as loudly and continuously as possible as to confuse her child mind and make her cry <br> laugh at the stupid crying loli in the street and floor the gas </br></br>   No Overlord thread <br>Shame on you, /a/!</br>  <br> discussing the latest vrmmo multi media project </br>  <br> Overlord <br> VRMMO <br>pick one</br></br></br>  <br>Overlord does not need to have thread everyday</br>  <br>We don't have to have a thread up 24/7 when there's nothing new to talk about.</br>  Just finished vol 4 , shits went better than I expected  Sebas dun goofed.

Animefag here. I heard the MC is a villain, but 3 episodes in and he's just generic hero, just a skeleton instead of flashy angel-like shit.  <br> Papa Bones <br> hero <br><br>I wish<br><br><br>Poor Arche ;_;</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does he have a conception spell?</br>  <br>I don't know m8, killing enemies in battlefield is pretty normal, regardless whether the method is edgy or not.</br>   Think the lizard romance last volume was cute as fuck. <br> Sebas completely blows that away this chapter. <br>Damn Sebas, why you gotta be so suave, let the lizards have something.</br></br>  Will we get to see the papa bones vs shalltear fight animated?  Been out of the loop. Anyone mind explaining where this tidal wave of MMORPG-themed anime came from?<br><br>I recall .hack from way back so the concept isn't new, what made it so popular now?</br></br>  <br>Digimon</br>  <br>MMORPG theme is so old and busted.<br>Resurrection theme is the new freshness.</br></br>  <br>Well, he plans the eradication of a sentient species just to make slightly stronger skellies.</br>  <br>This right here. MMO anime has old source material, soon they've gotta animate something new, and it's all about resurrection nowadays.</br>  <br>Monster Farm</br>  <br>I would most likely say, yes.<br>Because from the previews of Episode 4, it will finish with Volume 1 and dragging Volume 2 over 9 Episodes, would be too long.<br>I would say Episode 5 - 8 will be covering Volume two's 4 Chapters, and Episode 9 - 13 will cover Volume three's 5 Chapters.<br>Everything would be fitting perfectly and ending with a Epic Fight and Ending.</br></br></br></br>  post OC  <br>Nice,here's hoping for a second season.</br>  <br>He's a wizard.</br>  <br><br>Yes we do. Anyone who says otherwise is obvious lower lifeforms (slugs) and should be killed.</br></br>  <br>Because MMOs are dead and we watch the series that use them as a theme trying to relive our best times in games like EQ and WoW</br>  <br>Read the stats.<br><br>Alignment: Extreme Evil<br>Sense of Justice: -500<br><br>Ep 2 the only reason he helped was to see how his powers did against the new world and cause he felt he had a debt to repay to Touch Me. And he wanted info. In other words, he didnt help cause he cares about those humans.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good God, Ainz. That's just overkill.</br>  So I read Book 1 to 4 and the spoiler for the rest to 9, and I am concerned: MC and his army are way overpowered. I have yet to find anyone who managed to be a threat to them.<br><br>Sure, it's fun to follow a badass' journey, especially when he doesn't act exactly like a Gary Stu, but some credible danger would be nice too.<br><br>Hell, form what spoiler I read, book 9 (and probably book 10) will be about raising his reputation to an even higher level.</br></br></br></br>  PVs again in case you missed them.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2kv<wbr>DO3xJFEY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bU5<wbr>xBWmPp34</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Tuesday when? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him, I'm guessing the guy's sane and not overly evil but since he actually has become a lich not only has his emotions being suppressed but he's even matching game stats.<br><br>Though personally if I was extremely evil I wouldn't of left the 2 girls with a protective bubble and drag them along the ground kicking and screaming before dissecting them infront of the village, he could of atomized the village in an instant and saved the chief to force info out of him.<br><br>I know he's smart but that level of evil and to actually help out so much over a PERSONAL debt which he could easily ignore...I got a feeling he isn't sticking strictly to those stats, but I haven't read the manga and not sure if he starts matching stat for stat yet</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's one threat looming in the horizon which will probably come to the forefront after volume 9. It's not a threat that can be beaten physically so Ainz will probably have to do some fast thinking. PDL's not particularly stronger than Nazarick combined but he does have his hand on a  guild  and potential  WC items .</br>  <br>Would be nice to see him unlease the beast   Rubedo [/spoiler[ </br>  <br>Nigga, he's not the type of evil that goes around starting shit (except with the Lizardmen) or flaunting his power unprovoked. I personally believe he's one of the scary type of evil, the smart kind. He's pragmatic as fuck but not above letting any emotion he can feel sway him to the other side. He isn't as evil as he would have been if he'd been, say, born a lich with his stats but he's growing into his alignment pretty nicely.</br>  <br>So without knowing how strong kingdoms are in this world, you would have comitted pointless slaughter with no real benefit. <br>. There's evil, and there's stupidity. Nigga, you dumb</br></br>  <br>After Monday.</br>  <br>I'm playing FFXIV and it's more like the MMO's depicted in these recent anime than anything else.</br>  <br>Is it supposed to be loyal? It looks like it'd bite the hand feeding it.</br>  <br>Indeed, the alignment system in D&amp;D doesn't cover everything for a reason, when Stupid Evil, Stupid Good, Lawful Stupid, Stupid Neutral and Chaotic Stupid most certainly exist.</br>  <br>I thought that's what Int and Wis are for? It's not surprising quite a few people on this board have like -5 on their modifiers.</br>  <br>I suppose stupid being relegated to an INT score makes sense, but even players with proper INT scores still play Stupid all the time. Especially Chaotic Stupid.</br>  <br>I doubt anything in new world could be a threat to Nazarick.<br>Heck an army consist of 1500 demi-god levels 100 and they still coudn't past 8th floor.</br></br>  <br>It was perfectly possible to get through Nazarick with a dedicated team. They just gave up at lvl 8 because of the gotcha and didnt bother to try again.</br>  <br>Weren't most of those NPC mercenaries?<br>Plus all the 41 members were there.</br></br>  <br>Ainz is scared of other players who may or may not show up and we have those Dragon Lords and unknown world items around. Tension is generated because we don't know yet. Overlord has a ways to go and I'm sure there will be dangers that sort of threaten Nazarick...maybe, possibly. But just reading how they crush the lowly humans and enslave the other races is fun in its own way.</br>   Anime too dragged out <br> No spooky orchestra music playing on background when SPOOKY SKELETON on stage <br>Why the fuck is anyone even watching this</br></br>  <br>In the novels, he does experiments on humans. Not sure if they will show that in the anime. But human experimentations are definitely EVIL.</br>  <br>That's just playing out of character, or possibly in line with their background text and such. You can't measure everything with numbers even in DnD after all.</br>  <br>Which NPC ?<br>They can't even touch 1 member since they failed at 8th floors</br></br>  <br>Because It's entertaining and I'm autistic enough to enjoy infodumps?</br>  <br>A lot of those were NPCs and they got trolled by Victim who inflicted all the status effects in the game then Ainz nuked them with a World item.</br>  <br>I remember reading that the 1500 strong army was composed mostly of NPC mercenaries.</br>  <br>From a human perspective. From a Nazarick / Undead Overlord perspective? Not really. He's not even biologically capable of feeling it. <br><br>It'd be like asking a guy who had his nuts and pecker chopped off to stay virile for the rest of his life and he gets to live for the next 300 years after becoming a eunuch.<br><br>It's not like he doesn't realize it's bad by human standards, he just can't afford to care at this point when he's prioritizing safety and his body helps a fuck ton.<br><br>Whereas in a human body he'd be sweating bullets and guilt tripping himself so hard he'd never let it go through.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What about Rubedo ?<br>I thought she's the reason for their failure.</br></br>  Gamma the best.  <br> and the spoiler for the rest to 9, <br>Where?</br></br>  <br> experiments <br> On humans <br><br>I eagerly await this, I know his emotions have been suppressed and this just suits that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You just like lizard sex</br>  “Climb. Even if you desire power, don’t give up your humanity.”<br><br>“Give up on my humanity…? Are you speaking of the likes of demons that appear in stories?”<br><br>“That and others like turning into an undead or magic life forms.”<br><br>“A normal human cannot do something like that.”<br><br>“That’s true… but turning into an undead will often twist your heart as well. Desiring perfection, becoming an undead to achieve one’s ideal… the heart will be tempted by the changing flesh and the resulting transformation will be terrifying.”<br>Nooo Ainz stay good!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm also an animefag. <br><br>He monologues pretty heavily about how his current form is desensitizing him to just about anything that would make him flinch as a human being. <br>Pretty hard to miss the potential for his committing atrocities as he becomes increasingly more absorbed into this form/role of his.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What? Why would you think that? Nothing about her was mentioned during the description of the raid.</br>  <br>The formula is that the MC is overpowered but he plans meticulously and fully expects more resistance but he ends up winning much easier than he expects. It's been repeated since vol 1. Even in vol 7 when Demiurge reveals to Ainz that everyone was planning on world domination he just freaks out for a second then just goes with it. There's a part in vol 4. where he's talking with the Guardians and they are like 'well why don't we just do things more obviously instead of skulking around because then we can reveal the enemies faster' and he shits his robe.<br><br>They can't possibly bring out all the details from the LN or WN. There are far too many one sentence things like Ainz's despair aura or the spooky faces coming from the staff of ainz ool gown that never get mentioned again.</br></br></br>  <br>Not him but Rubedo probably had a part in it, though how much is another question altogether.<br><br>Every single guardian even PA was not allowed on the 8th floor. It takes someone of Victim level to stay on that floor, so Rubedo had to be something special like  oh I don't know made from the Caloric Stone making her a world class npc and living up to her name? </br></br></br>  <br>see<br><br>Rubedo isn't mentioned to have done anything yet. I'm not even sure Ainz visited the 8th floor yet at all, since he told everyone to stay out of there. Apparently the strongest are on that floor, even though they aren't lvl100. This doesn't include Victim who came out during vol 4 to float around for a bit.</br></br></br>  <br>I remember reading somewhere she's guards the 8th floor with Victim and Gargantua. Heck a guy said that she even stronger than Touch Me.</br>  Since Lupusregina is the faith-based caster of the Pleiades, I wonder if her name is a reference to the Bitch Queen, an evil god in the Forgotten Realms D&amp;D setting.  <br>Rubedo being the Miko would mean she is level 100. Unless Miko is another NPC by process of elimination it would make her Rubedo, because Lastborn cannot be the same level as Sebas as written earlier.</br>  <br>I wonder what world class items albedo has. I recently read vol 1 of the LN and apparently she has two but they haven't mentioned them. Isn't she World class npc then?</br>    <br>Gargantua guards the 4th floor.<br> Rubedo is rumored to be the cherry blossoms Guardian in the 8th floor, Victim is the 8th floor Guardian.<br> Nobody is stronger than Touch Me.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, she's on the 8the floor. And the narration did say something vague like "the raid was halted on the 8th floor" and not "Victim stopped the raid on the 8th floor." So I guess it's possible she did something if anyone made it to her lair after Victim went off.</br>  <br>No, it's fundamentally a bit different. Ainz for example has a WC item. However Touch Me is a world class champion even if he doesn't hold a WC item.<br><br>Get the difference? While a WC item certainly puts you on the same level, if not higher depending on the item, your fundamental base isn't changed.</br></br></br>  <br> Nobody is stronger than Touch Me. <br>Maybe Ulbert? Possibly.</br></br>    <br>By tidal wave you mean a splash n the kiddie pool? You can't name more than 5 anime franchises in the last 10 years that have MMORPG in any significant value.</br>  <br>Ulbert might have strongest magic caster class.<br>But he's not world class chamion.</br></br>   Pdf/epub link please. On mobile atm, can't do shit. ;_;   <br><br>can anyone add in ni shibullath in onto the background?</br></br>  <br>Lupus just means wolf son, theres a lot of wolf queens in fiction.<br><br>I figured.<br><br>see <br>was what I read in the novels<br>Rubedo has done nothing, we just barely know it exists.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA</wbr></br>  <br>Ulbert was the magic equivalent of the world champion. This is because the world champion is pure physical and it'd be unfair to casters.<br><br>Ulbert however was always depicted as playing 2nd fiddle, and Touch Me being the gary stu with his ballin' wife and children being a level 100 raijuu.</br></br></br>  <br>It might just be a repeat of the ainz vs shalltear fight with Shalltear winning because Touch Me isn't an npc. <br><br>The goblin with the wc stick would kill him though and all of the tomb.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, anon.</br>  <br>What's this shit I hear about Touch Me and Ulbert getting into it in real life and why it's most likely the reason they quit the guild?</br>  <br>10/10</br>  <br>Many of the 'transported to another world' and "mmorpg is real" have been around for a long time and many are popular. SAO is the latest biggest one for anime, the LN is high ranked as well. Mushoku Tensei is another resurrection type that is the top LN now. But you can go as far back as Zero no Tsukihime or whatever. Overlord is pretty old as is, it took a long time to come from WN-&gt;LN-&gt;anime.</br>    If our youngest was here… if we moved as Pleiades then we wouldn’t have a problem…  <br>So according to Solution, the youngest sister of Pleiades might be in 8th floor too ?<br>Damn, there are just so many secrets about the it.</br></br>  <br>We don't know what Rubedo does. All we know is that currently in the new world Rubedo is the strongest being in Nazarick, cause ya know the other 40 players aren't here and Ainz has one damn gimp shit build that would be low-mid tier max without his decked out items.<br><br>I mean it's a game where the average player at level 100 had 1 divine item max. Max. Most none at all. <br><br>If put into WoW terms, it'd be like vanilla level 60 in blues with one purple from a dungeon versus full t3 with legendary.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe Rubedo's the youngest.</br>  <br>Why I can't touch all of those Albedos.</br>  <br>Ainz didn't actually use any of his skills to win that, just spamming items. You could say that its just a matter of whoever abuses more World Class items at this point and which effect wins harder.<br>Don't forget all the Divine/Mythic class items that fuck people over too. Gazef without his stamina gloves is pretty shit.</br></br>  <br>Maruyama does keep a lot of potential asspullery handy. Half-done character sheets, mysterious super NPCs in reserve. No ability descriptions for Nazarick's world class items.</br>  <br>She's taking about Lastborn.</br>  <br>Don't forget about Albedo's younger sister.</br>  <br>maybe the miko<br>or rubedo is the miko<br>or Albedo's sister is the miko<br>or albedo's sister is rubedo and she's just hiding in the frozen prison for shits and giggles.</br></br></br></br>  Since Gate is going to get localized, I can only hope Overlord does too later down the line.  <br>This is the kind of story I like. I like my OP MC story with a little substance but not too much that it would overpower my hankering for a good beatdown.</br>  <br>If they're lovecraftian horrors they should be enemies to good and evil alike. Not that "summon them and bail" isn't a suitable strategy for an evil person.<br><br><br>A space marine chapter would probably be on even footing with everything but floor guardians and Ainz himself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yep, so you'd have to wonder what makes her special enough to reside on the 8th floor when she's not even level 100.</br>  <br><br>Oh right, forgot about her. Damn, the 8th floor's pretty balling.<br>Victim<br>Rubedo<br>Lastborn<br>What else?<br><br>Which floor sucks, geographywise? My vote goes to Chair's graveyard. Compared to the others, it's a bit not impressive.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't even list out the classes. Since max level is 15 for any class it would have to take up a huge amount of space but of course that allowed him to give Ainz the Eclipse class. <br>I think its a good choice though, because most of the tension in the story is based around how things are going to play out or what new secret move is going to get shown next and we already get enough infodumps as it is.</br></br>  Is Moomin more /a/ related or it's more /co/ related? If we talk about the Japanese 90's series.  <br>Yeah, let talk about Avatar. Oh wait, we can discuss chink &amp; gook shit here, it's basically asian bootleg manga so i guess we can discuss western bootleg manga &amp; anime too</br>  <br> western bootleg <br>It's a japanese anime loosely based on a finnish book series.<br>saying moomins isnt anime is pretty much saying that the World Masterpiece Theater series arent anime either. fuck off kid.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm talking about bootleg like Avatar, rwby and shit like this</br>  Moomins was creepy as shit  What about the MYSTERIOUS CITIES OF GOLD<br><br>CHILDREN OF THE SUN<br>NOW YOUR TIME HAS JUST BEGUN<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9ki<wbr>99YBVKyw</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>That voiced intro pumped you up so hard.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>(I add this because it's a Jap/French collab)</br>  <br>I hate the things I've seen in season 2. artstyle is awful, even the OST isn't even good.</br>  <br>I don''t expect any remake or reboot of a classic series/movie/etc. to hold any water in the 21st century.

I didn't know that.</br>  <br>Moomins an anime faggot</br>      Didn't moomins have an episode which was too scary to be shown in most countries?  <br>I watched that as kid,it was nice.</br>  <br>Think so</br>    <br>Yeah, at least in Finland the one where the pirates actually threaten to kill Snork Maiden wasn't aired.</br>  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_<wbr>of_Moomin_(1990)_episodes</wbr>  Moomins is undoubtedly anime. <br><br> produced in Japan <br> Japanese studio <br> almost all of the staff Japanese <br> original voice cast Japanese <br> released in Japan first <br><br>I think the project was initiated by the Finns, with the intention of being aired in Finland (and rest of Europe), but that's about it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nigga, the world, lore and characters were written by swede-finn Tove Jansson.<br>Nips were interested in this and it was a co-joint production but arguably most of the show is Japanese by production values so it's pretty much a anime still.</br></br>  <br>Are you agreeing or disagreeing with me?</br>  <br>That fucking walrus, jesus christ the nightmares</br>  <br><br>Both of those were scary as fuck.</br></br>  <br>Don't forget the monster Moomin turned into in the first episode.</br>  So how should I watch this, finn, swe or jap dub?  <br>I know that both Japanese and Finnish versions are pretty good. If you're not Finnish then I would recommend that you go with the Japanese considering it's the original version.</br>  <br>Finnish</br>  <br>Finish voice acting is more true to original source material. The characters are portrayed quite differently compared to japanese. For an example the snork maiden is much girlish in the japanese version.</br>  <br>Sort of what I expected then. If I can find eng subs for the finn dub I'll probably watch that</br>  <br> eng subs <br>You won't find subs for either, at least not complete subs.

I'm starting to wonder if it was ever actually released commercially or just aired in Swedish.</br>  Are we forever doomed with the English dub for this?  <br>I found that the entire Swedish dub is uploaded to youtube. Perhaps there are other dubs on there, though I doubt translated to English</br>  <br>It's because the Swedish dub was made by Finns. Finnish releases have both Finnish and Swedish dub, but unfortunately no English subs it seems.</br>  <br>The only playlists I can find are missing half the episodes.</br>  <br>That makes it a pain to try to buy them.
