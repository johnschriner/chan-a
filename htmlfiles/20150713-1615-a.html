It's bad enough with the fucking pixel collages as the OPs showing who will and will not be drawn.</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>No, fuck off. Retards like you are what's ruining these threads.</br>  <br>Oh that! well then that explains it.</br>  <br>Nice. Wish mine was in there.</br>  <br>I need to draw more. Then maybe I will make this list.</br>  <br>Now I remember! You're magnificent.</br>  <br>You know, didn't you at one point say who were sorry about shitposting so much, and that you were going to either stop or go away forever?</br>  <br> mfw I slept through that </br>  <br> someone shitposts your waifu <br> now she will never be drawn <br><br>Seems fair.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I am sorry, and I have stopped. Stop trying to play me as the bad guy.</br>  <br>You sound mad that you don't make those anon. I wonder why that is?</br>  <br>Thanks for skipping my waifu now that I realize it ;_;</br>  <br>Thanks again man</br>   you will never be awake for all the good drawfags' deliveries/collages <br> shitposters, haremfags, and circlejerking faggots have a better shot of her getting drawn than you </br>  <br>Do you also believe in the tooth fairy?</br>  <br> criticize fucking anything in these threads <br> LOL UR JUST JEALOUS FUCKING AUTISTIC MANCHILD WHY WOULD YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A WAIFU <br>Every time.</br></br></br>  <br>Why haven't you hanged yourself, Mishafag?</br>  <br>That's because they're dedicated anon.<br>Maybe if you loved your waifu more you'd get deliveries.</br></br>  Who are the harem waifus anyway?  <br>Get a hobby.</br>  Another collage that causes more hate than happiness. Y'all need to lighten up.  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>But where's waifu-tan?</br>  <br> half the people there just avatarfag and act like 13 year olds straight off of deviantart <br> implying they actually love her <br>Nice meme.</br></br></br>  <br>Next to Taiga</br>  <br>Thank you for draw her I like it a lot have a good night</br>  <br>  he's in there <br><br>Thank you for drawing him!</br></br></br>  <br>*dedicated to shitposting</br>  <br>Ah right, couldn't tell at first. I thought it was someone else for a second.</br>  I can't wait for the day this circle shit falls apart and it eats itself alive. Maybe then everyone would have a better shot at getting her drawn.  <br>What is the circle?</br>  <br> circle shit falls apart <br>In what way? The rampant memeposting of "circle jerkle" every time someone's waifu isn't drawn?<br><br>Or the circle itself exploding?</br></br></br></br>  <br>A miserable pile of waifus</br>    <br>a coping mechanism</br>  <br>We got a Circle member trying to play dumb here.</br>  <br>Sadly, probably only 10 percent of people in these threads love their waifu for real, especially when most of them in their circlejerk chat outright claim to going out with 3DPD, it's a disgusting state 4chan has come to.</br>  <br>There is no circle, I don't draw and I get a delivery or two every week</br>  <br>An ebin meme.</br>  <br>But enough talk</br>  <br>Have at you!</br>  <br> outright claim to going out with 3DPD <br>Why do you just make shit up? What are you getting out of this? I'm pretty sure everyone I know in there is 3D-single. If anyone's dating they've never once mentioned it, and I'm in there all the time.</br></br>  Do we post our sharks before or after he posts?  <br>One day, the Circle will get too greedy and they will try to bite off more than they can chew. There will be lots of political strife and in-fighting, until 34 has to close her stream. With nowhere to go, they'll lash out at the WWD and any drawfags who don't agree with them. Sooner or later, these threads will be at a worse state than they already are.</br>    <br>someone please draw this with a vampirefu and tomato juice</br>  <br>Same.<br>I even got three this week.<br><br>The circle is just a thing people use to feel better when they don't get their waifu drawn.<br>I'd hate to say it, but maybe the request itself might be the problem. Maybe the drawfag just doesn't feel interested in a particular situation you want to have your waifu drawn in.<br><br> Or maybe your waifu a shit.  Although there's only a 1% chance of that being true.  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What chat is he talking about anyway?</br>  did we kill sharkbro?  <br> I'm pretty sure <br><br>So what you're saying is you're spouting just as much stupid conjecture as he is.</br></br></br>  <br>How would that give "a better shot at getting her drawn"?</br>  <br>Nice damage control, Circlefuck.</br>  <br> 1% <br>hehe haha hoohoo</br></br>  <br>34's stream is where the circle congregates</br>  <br> The circle is just a thing people use to feel better when they don't get their waifu drawn. <br>Why do people still try to deny that some of the drawfags sit in their little streams and skype chats and circlejerk? It's embarrassing, this shit isn't news.</br></br>  <br><br>Birdy next!</br></br>  <br><br>I'm trying hard not to spaghetti all over the keyboard here. It's just .. wow.<br>Amazing work, both of you! Fantastic job! It's so lovely~</br></br></br>  <br>If it is, I wouldn't know.<br>I just request my waifu, and get deliveries.<br>I don't even draw and I get deliveries anyway.</br></br></br>  <br> Is it embarrassing to Skype chat? Honest question. Is it simply that they voice chat on stream?</br>  <br>HYPE</br>  <br>Golden ages always follow times of violence. When the mods have to clean up the Circle's shitposting, new drawfags will arrive. Waifus will be drawn, no one outside of haremfags are left out.<br> That is, until the new drawfags form a circlejerk of their own. </br></br>  <br>inb4 massive shitstorm</br>  My waifu is reading me a bed time story...  <br>Will the rest carry over to next week?</br>  <br>Will my waifu be delivered in time?! Probably not.</br>  <br> Oora hands <br>god save us please</br></br>  Reminder that even Lolyfag is deeper in the circle than you.  Can I get a melfina from outlaw star bein a sexy cutie pls 0~0  <br>No, it's that as if talking amongst themselves about the thread in a stream chat wasn't enough, they talk to each other in skype in private. They're extremely fucking circle-jerky, they're like a clique of high school girls. Probably because one of them is one.</br>  <br>Except loly and every loly alt is banned from every known stream.</br>  <br>Everyone is closer with everyone and everything than me dude. I'm a nobody, and I'd like to keep it that way.</br>  <br>Good taste, but do you have refs?</br>  <br>There's nothing embarrassing about it, it's just a normal chat room like the ones the internet has had since 1997.<br>Some of these guys can't function in social environments, so they have this "LOL HIGH SCHOOL SHIT, EMBARRASSING" meme they spew.</br></br>  <br> 1997 was 18 years ago <br>Holy shit</br></br>  <br><br><br>I'm in the same camp as you guys delivery-wise, and even I am aware of and against the circlejerk.<br> I only really realized it once I was in a dry spell because a certain underageb&amp; whined about me after a certain waifu nuke. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Friends talking to each other doesn't automatically make them an Illuminati. How paranoid can you get?</br>  <br>Joke's on you, I am the same.</br>  <br>Wow! I wasn't expecting that at all, thank you orz! Great job on all of those waifus, all the poses are great and everyone is so cute! Especially Laharl-chan, not biased.</br>  <br>Koborifg pls</br>  <br> Friends talking to each other doesn't automatically make them an Illuminati. <br>And not once did I say it did, friend.</br></br>  <br>Thank you anon~  Still better than what I can do. <br><br><br>That Oora is really fantastic and that Magneton is perfect, thank you so much anonkyun~</br></br></br></br>  <br>You n' me brother. What say we hurry up and learn to draw gud so we can draw our waifus eh?</br>  <br>It's the new "IRC list".</br>  <br>koborifag? is that you?</br>  <br> break off into little cliques where you jerk each other off and talk about the threads <br> not dumb highschool level shit <br><br>Okay.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The waifufag IRC</br>  <br> ~ <br>Out.</br></br>  <br>Drawcucks have started infesting that, too.</br>  <br> break off into little cliques <br><br>There's no cliques dude, there's just the people who talk and the people who don't.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes.<br><br><br>Sorry, anon. I'll have to stop sometime soon since my neck hurts like crazy and I have classes tomorrow.<br>But don't despair, I'll be back next weekend.<br><br><br>No problem!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How do i become a member of the circle?  So<br>There'a a bunch of drawfags, they get together in skype/streams and shit and talk with each other/talk about the thread? And some of them talk shit? Am I understanding this?</br>  <br>No thanks, I'm good.<br><br><br>Go back to your grave.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That will save me from requesting it next time, thank you!</br>  <br> http://pastebin.com/MiFdV75N </br>  <br>Join the 34 stream and be sure to announce who your waifu is and avatarfag like no tomorrow.</br>  <br>Go to the stream and talk to people.<br>There is no circle. Everyone is welcome. They even let lolyfag chat and people greet him and shit.</br></br>    <br>Epic.<br><br>Pretty much. There's also a mentality of "people who actually have waifus are autistic" there. They basically just sit and bitch about the thread and drama shit.</br></br></br>  <br>That was never a thing though.</br>  <br> Yes. <br>I love you.</br></br>  What do you want to see in the new chapters? Should it focus on Guts with his JRPG party on the boat? Or should it focus on the fallout of the slap and Griffiths reaction to it?  Why does Griffith hate Guts?  <br>Because Griffith wants his dick.</br>  <br>It's a 100 pages chapter, we'll get both.</br>   Berserk <br><br>fuck off.</br></br>  I think that the slappening was a big deal to Griffith, so I want to see how he reacts to that as soon as possible. Perhaps we can dedicate 2 chapters to seeing how Guts n' Pals are doing, then another 2 to Griffith reacting to being emasculated by Rickert.<br><br>I'm just wondering what they're going to do with Casca though. Will she really be cured? Or will Guts simply just leave her with the elves and then venture out to take care of Griffith?</br></br>   Guts and his fanclub get off the boat <br> "waaah, it felt like we were on it for years!" </br>  <br>what? Since when do berserk threads belong in /v/?<br><br>He doesn't hate guts. He was jealous of guts, or shaken by guts belief system. Guts did not have any ambitions or goals in life that consumed him to the point of having no personal freedom, he was free to do what he liked, and somehow good at it too. And better yet, he was the first to view Griffith as a friend, and not as some superhuman abomination. This all changed when the sacrifice happened of course.<br><br>we need this, miura never breaks the 4th wall. Maybe some idolmaster references.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> what? Since when do berserk threads belong in /v/? <br>Since the dawn of fucking time.</br></br>  Puck better break the fourth wall and make fun of the crazy hiatuses of the past few years.  <br>Because berserk is completely not anime and manga related right.</br>  <br>He's going to be the one to make the "Woah, we're in Elfhelm already? That sure was fast!" comment.</br>  <br>are you baiting? or are you an autistic retard who needs to stop coming on /a/ during summers?</br>  Just started playing the PS2 Berserk game, it doesn't emulate very well but it's playable. I was enjoying myself until the guy who translated it spelled "Guts" as "Gatsu".<br><br>This translation patch came out in 2014, there's literally no excuse for this.</br></br>  What was Guts expression trying to convey here during this scene?<br><br>Was he sad that he seriously messed up the girls life and turned her her life upside down by killing her father? Did he regret the the things he said to her?</br></br>  <br>He is a tortured, permanently scarred soul. Every now and again he can't keep his face straight.</br>  <br>Regret and sadness for the "Go ahead kill yourself" panel</br>  <br>He realized that his actions effect other people and he was probably sad ge couldn't do jack shit against Femto. Either way its one of the most beautiful and iconic panels in mange history</br>  Is guts the strongest human (no-magic) character in manga?  <br>Everyone else covered it pretty well, but I just want to add that it was this was the page that stopped me from dropping Berserk. Seeing Guts show genuine remorse for his actions made me realize that there was going to be more to him than just "ANGRY EDGELORD SWINGS SWORD GRRR".<br><br><br>I don't thin Guts can get for that title anymore considering the Berserker armor, the JRPG party and how the Dragon sword now lies in the ethereal plane. Berserk's pretty magical now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, but Guts is weak compared to Mihawk because he's the strongest swordsman in the world. Everything I said are facts.</br>  <br>I dont consider the berserker armor to be THAT magical</br>  <br>Deep sadness for what he was forced to do. Guts cursed someone's life into revenge, that's basically like giving up your life, as what is Guts has done with his life Post-Eclipse.<br><br>After killing off the Count, Theresia was just fucked. Her whole world was broken, everything she knew was destroyed and she had no reason to live.<br>Guts basically was right in telling her that she had no reason to live and that she should kill herself if life was too hard for her to live.<br>But he fucked her up in the only way possible. Guts acted his part by pretending to be an edgy fuck by accepting her challenge that she will kill him but it sadened him that he put someone else on the same path as him.<br><br><br> remorse for his actions <br>Like hell he does. It's that Guts feels sad that to save a life, he had to condemn it to revenge, which is basically like killing Theresia himself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It allows him to jump around and do acrobatics that Guts could never do before, not to mention how it stops him from feeling any pain and literally holds him together no matter how many bones he breaks.<br><br>Then the loli witch has to rescue him from it, it's pretty damn magical.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Im i the only one who thought puck was a loli fairy until Ivalera appears?</br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>stop replying</br>  <br>Basically confirms before the golden age arc that Guts was not just a revenge-fueled beast who believed everything he said (i.e. fuck people's lives, fuck you, fuck everyone). Instead of just being an edgy fuck just to be edgy, he is not only shielding everyone around him from his perpetual doomed-existence, but most of the time it shields him from his own true nature: that he is actually an emotional person full of empathy for other people.</br>  Are there drawings by Kentaro Miura of others' mangas?  <br>I remember when he drew that piece against the loli ban he drew Louise in it, probably a bunch of different anime characters too. I don't have it on me though.</br>  I don't really care which it is I'm just stoked that it's back  <br>Fuck, you're right.</br>  So how many chapters will get written this time before he goes back to idolmaster?  I just want some rape and suffering in berserk, is it too much to ask?  <br>Yes. Everything is happy now. Guts will follow his dreams from now on , just like Griffith. </br>  <br>We're a healing manga now son.</br>  What are your top 3 personal favorite arcs?  <br><br>What happened to ''Excitement and Enjoyment''?<br>Is this manga becoming the new shieldbro?</br></br></br>  <br>Irvine's transformation is sex.</br>  <br>You're dumb.</br>  <br> shitposting <br><br>fuck off.</br></br></br>  Last thread<br><br><br><br>Keep shitposting to a minimum.<br><br>Will ufotable ever go back to their old artstyle?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127994424 <br>fukken rekt</br>  Played the game already on my vita. Game mechanics are very good but the story is shit.  <br>the art looks horrible, it's full of CG and has somewhat good music <br><br>anything more of /a/ consensus about it?</br></br></br>  <br>Sounds like a great candidate to make an anime out of!<br><br>The fuck do this people think</br></br></br>  <br> tfw Shingeki no Bahamut had literally no story and was just a card game but the anime turned out to be decent <br><br>It's definitely possible.</br></br></br>  I hope the thread doesn't get full of /v/ermins like last one.    <br>Namco (the ones who chose to make the anime, and had Ufotable do it) wanted to use the anime to advertise the franchise. They chose Ufo because they already worked on the franchise (game OPs, I think) and they also made anime for another of their franchises (Tales, which is also getting another anime by Ufo next year)<br>So they deicided to advertise the game with a TV show made by an studio that already worked for them before. Not so weird, right?</br></br>  <br><br>you realize this entire adaptation's purpose is to be a giant glorified advertisement to the remake of the first game, right?</br></br>  <br>With same regard, for the people who doesn't know, Capcom have countless merchandises for Monster Hunter like purses, handbags, handphone covers, capsule toys, kitchenware, figures, socks, jackets, comics, i.e. anything under the sun for advertising the franchise as well.</br>  DIOOOOOOOOOOO  <br/>  <br>why make an anime of the least popular MH clone though?

Does it bother you it's not your generic harem animu cheap artstyle?</br>  <br>Fuck doujins, I want official art. I want to see her animated and wrecking shit.<br>Ufotable, Hirao pls.</br></br>  I never thought I'd see the day where I complain that an anime doesn't have any anti-aliasing.  <br>why is it that everyone who liked this anime is a /v/bruh?<br><br>most of /v/ have never even played the vidya there are more /v/ bruhs in dbz threads than itt tbh</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Jesus Christ those /v/ermins crossboarders are horribly cancerous, someone do something.</br></br></br>  <br> so posterior destroyed he doesn't even read the entire post <br><br>Hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br> itt tbh <br>Stop</br></br>  So how were the first threads when the ep aired?<br><br>/a/ liked it? Or just shitposters.

Simply because it's a videogame adaptation.<br>Nevermind the fact that /v/ is way too normalfag to have EVER heard of God Eater or doing anything else than calling it "weebshit" if someone ever brought it up.</br></br>  <br>Again, because Bamco wanted to advertise it<br>Go cry to Capcom to get them to hire some studio to make a MH anime, MHfag<br>It's not hard to understand that Bamco would want to advertise their game with a TV show?<br> least popular <br>Maybe that's precisely why they want to advertise it with a TV show? Because it's not popular? <br>Stuff that's already popular doesn't need advertising<br>Why are you so dumb?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Do fans of the game like the artstyle?<br>Because I don't play it and thought it looked awful but maybe is just not for me.</br>  Posting glorious OSTs<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=l28<wbr>JllnZ5PE</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rT0<wbr>WpdrCJYE</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=crE<wbr>cGrcW2Xk</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=aop<wbr>qrLFgAFk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's better than the game.

The character animation is extremely choppy though, to the point some scenes look like it's just a couple FPS (like the gum scene). <br><br>The backgrounds are gorgeous, and don't look like they belong in the show. They can do some cool stuff with the characters being full CGI, but it ends up looking terrible more often than not.<br><br>The story is really bland though. I don't give a shit about any of the characters and I'm having a tough time following what is going on.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not complaining here. UFOTable doesn't look like they can do 2D well for the Aragamis.</br>   another chinese cartoon about sending emotionally-unstable teenagers to do the job trained adults should do <br> also, terribad CGI </br>  <br> characters being full CGI <br>They're 2D</br></br>  <br> Characters are full CGI <br>Stop this retarded meme. The only CGI is the aragami.</br></br>  <br> Trained adults <br>Good job finding them considering how dangerous being a GE is. Most of them don't live enough to see adulthood<br> Terribad CGI <br>The aragami looked great, faggot</br></br></br></br>  <br>instantly raided by IRC, there were no survivors</br>  <br><br>he'll die later I bet. Gotta build him up a little bit before he jobs</br></br>  <br>Second is PSO2. That makes GE in 3rd place.</br>  <br><br>So they managed to make 2D look as awful as CGI, and don't get any of the budget saving that CGI gets?<br><br>Wow, way to go GE!</br></br></br></br>  <br>why couldn't we just get this?</br>  <br><br>nigger, in the event of an apocalyptic event where titans/BETA/eotans/whatever the fuck else invade, which age demographic do you think gets killed first.</br></br>  <br> Good job finding them considering how dangerous being a GE is. Most of them don't live enough to see adulthood <br>Why not just use adults for the God Eater procedure to begin with rather than angsty teenagers?</br></br>  <br> there are more people in this picture than there are people who actually bought GE </br>  <br>How could you not tell they were 2D? It's clearly 2D with heavy digital effects</br>  <br>  <br>There's a reason, Soma was the youngest God Eater at twelve.<br><br> He's part aragami, when he came out the womb he devoured his mother, she's with him always. <br><br>The CGI/shading is shit though. I had hopes the animation would be like the previous game OPs, OVA and pachiko game.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>most studios can't into complex monster movement. The only one's left that know how are the industry veterans, and there isn't enough of them or time these days.</br></br>  <br>You wanted shading, you got it.</br>  <br>Because they decided to go with the style of the opening of the latest game (GE2RB)<br>Sorry that you dislike different artstyles<br><br>It looks great, fuck off</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seems alright. Downloaded the game to try it out on my phone.<br><br>I doubt I'll ever play it though</br></br></br>  <br>Nice repeating numerals dude, shame that the artstyle isn't as good as your triple dubs.</br>  <br>But it is like the latest game OP</br>  <br>haha ur rite lol</br>   this show looks like shit, it has too much details! <br>You fucks are crazy. Or rather, you're ignorant as hell.</br>  <br>I don't get why /v/ is the boogeyman. Every thread about this game on /v/ gets shitposted because it's not MH.</br>  I like Ufotable, but I'm honest enough to admit that the characters look bad.<br>On the other hand, the Aragamis look great, but the animation is shit and the CG just doesn't blend well with the 2D drawings.<br>The battles are underwhelming.</br></br>  <br> phone <br>wat</br></br>  Fuck you God Eater. UBW's final episodes would've been animated better if you didn't take away their budget.  <br> He think UBW wasn't top priority to the point GE got delayed 2 weeks <br>Just fuck off.</br></br>  <br>Who is this pretty young tan'g?</br>  <br> newly /v/ermin calling senpai newfag  <br><br>This is embarrassing.</br></br></br>  <br> Keep shitposting to a minimum. <br>CG shit. ufotable is finished!</br></br>  <br><br> not realizing the whole point of GE's 2 week delay was the production bottleneck on UBW episode 15 during the winter break <br><br>how about no</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why the women wearing such revealing clothes in the battlefield? Don't they think that they are 90% responsible of all the men death for distracting them while moving around with those clothes?</br></br>  <br><br>This project got massively fucked over by UBW.<br><br>I'd be glad if I was ufo/bamco that this somehow didn't end up becoming BlazBlue or Gunslinger Stratos levels of terrible</br></br></br></br>  <br> Had to cancel the advanced screening of episode 1 <br> Had to delay the actual airing a week <br>How does this situation lead you to believe that they were focusing on GE instead of UBW?</br></br></br>  Has there actually been any official comments on the approach they've taken with the animation? The coloring looks like nothing I have ever seen in any other anime, from a technical standpoint. What exactly are the production methods used?  Holy shit I just watched the episode. <br><br>What was that?<br><br>The animation looks horrible and the amount of CG almost made me throw up.

I understand what the problem is. The execution was fine and Eric even got to live, unlike in the game. I finished the first game and even I thought the first episode was okay.</br></br>  <br> They really wanted Yuu as the protagonist. <br>Why?</br></br>  <br><br>I like how they removed the likes/dislikes and the comments. There were originally an assload of dislikes for this video.</br></br>  <br> eric is gonna die  i guarantee that,</br>  <br>Japan really like their bland non-offensive protagonists.</br>  <br>Probably to see animated Alisa getting horny for Yuu</br>  <br>But Alisa gets horny for the Protagonist, in the Manga's case the Protagonist was Yuu.</br>  Pretty bad, but manages to look better than most of the attempts at CGI anime I've seen. Which still isn't that good, but it's still preferable to Knights of Sidonia.  <br>Also he's in the LN, the manga and LNs are tied to the game and 'Yuu' is canon. Just like 'Hiro'.<br><br>These names they choose for the protags though.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's still superior to his role in the game, where he got less than 5 lines before dying in the very beginning.</br></br>  <br> The protagonist revealing his SUPER SPECIAL POWER. <br><br>His power is not special or unique. There are other New-Types, he's just the first assigned to the branch he's a part of. Also all it means is that his God Arc can transform between a sword and gun, while Old-Types can only use one or the other.</br></br></br>   They don't know about the real best girl <br>Fools.</br>  I want to see Kanon shoot someone in mid-jump!<br>Seriously, fuck her.</br>  <br>You clearly haven't played the PC port then.</br>  <br>lmao stick to nasushit ufo</br>  Das it mane  <br>The monster CGI is horrible. They are really abusing the slow mo and why does Ufo likes to use shitty CGI on everything. Rain, sky, smoke? CGI for fucking everything.</br>  No results from searching, so is anyone noticing the shaking? Every time there's any scene with little to no actual movement you can see that the camera is constantly moving back and forth just 1-2 pixels. Is this a CR fuckup or what?  Why is /a/ so afraid of CG in their anime?  <br>Because it's slowly getting closer to the 3DPD they hate so much.<br><br> Pick all food <br> Lasagna isn't food <br> A chair is <br>Nigga..</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> intentionally faking Ambient Occlusion/faking Radiance/making shadows look like shit <br>WHYYY<br><br>What kind of world do we live in?</br></br></br></br>  <br> didnt i tell you to stay out my line of fire? </br>  <br>I could do with some more CG, alright.</br>  <br>Both shows have some great Slav characters for sure.</br>  <br>FUCK YOU KANON</br>  <br>See how the characters looks really out of place when comparing it to the background.</br>  <br>Hardly the worst offense in that cour.</br>  <br>Because Yuu x Alisa OTP probably</br>  <br>But Cinderella Girls doesn't use CG.</br>  Are we gonna see Hannibal, Arda Nova, and Shio here?  <br><br> shio <br><br>no time for her. Probably alisa shit and probably a lindow "buy the remake" cliffhanger</br></br></br></br>  <br> No time <br>Isn't the show 2 cour?</br></br>  <br><br>1</br></br>  How many Frodos will we see in the future for this show?  <br>Guess I should expect unfinished cliff hanger or extremely rushed pacing.<br><br><br>Not many I'd expect, most of the situations couldn't have been avoided, and the ones that can could be solved by "Don't bring Alisa along"</br></br></br></br>  <br>how do they get their sleeves through the bracelet if they cant take it off?</br>  <br>I'll be honest, as a fan of the game I have always wondered about this.</br>  <br>Going by OP's pic, most are not even wearing sleeves.</br>  I want to fuck alisa  <br>Get in line bruh</br>  <br>But the game isn't that long. There are a lot of useless missions between the plot important ones.</br>  <br>Well that's most of her worth, she's not exactly useful ingame, usually have to kill everything myself when I played.</br>  <br> she's not exactly useful ingame <br> always heals you <br> always gives you full bursts <br> rarely ever dies <br><br>She's one of your best teammates once she gets over the PTSD. I don't think any of the characters can kill big targets by themselves, anyway; or at least not as fast as you, the player, can.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Just finished it, that was awesome. Loving all the Licca and Hibari screentime too.  <br> always heals you <br> always gives you full bursts <br> rarely ever dies <br>Did I play a game with different AI coding? I always brought along Gina and Kanon and they always played far more useful than Alisa.</br></br></br></br>  So which game do I need to play? God Eater Burst, right?  <br> Either way, from what I'm hearing, normal folks love it. <br>You're using this as a fucking baseline? I guess SnK is the greatest anime ever made, why even try anymore?</br></br>  <br>Yes you did, Kanon aoe and friendly fire is a huge issue, and far less useful than Alisa's constant buffs.</br>  <br> Kanon <br>Wow, maybe you did.</br></br>  <br> she's not exactly useful ingame <br> always heals you <br> always gives you full bursts <br> rarely ever dies <br>This. She practically kept me alive in some of the bosses. Best partner ever.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him but did you mistake her with Shio maybe? Her AI is pretty stupid.<br>In the other hand, Alisa is really great. She was always in my team.</br></br>  <br> PSO games are now considered MH clones.  <br><br>MH wouldn't exist without the original PSO. Just shows how dominant MH is I guess.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Playing it right now. Why is the no fucking undub holy shit.</br>  <br> Because that's some AT3 Hymnos stuff. <br>Nigger please, it's just a repetitive goddamn mess of UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ, wubstep, violin, and electric guitars, with one simple vocal track going at once. It's nothing like Hymnos at all.</br></br>  <br>There is an undub for the psp.</br>  <br>From my experience, Alica would always run off and solo enemies without me commanding, while Gina and Kanon sticks with me all the time, keeping me alive and dishing out damage.</br>  <br> Aragami down, flailing like mad <br> Get ready for devour <br> Alisa readies her devour too <br> Almost simultaneously released devour at the same time <br> Alisa automatically reverts into gun mode and blasts me with link burst shots until level 3. <br><br>Every. Single. Time. Best teammate? Hell yeah.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Incoming KIA   <br>If by keeping you alive you mean sending you flying with friendly fire then sure.</br>  <br><br><br>there is</br></br></br>  <br>This. IIRC, it had some issues with Alisa in some missions though.</br>  <br><br><br>it's a miracle his design doesn't look so incredibly stupid in the anime as it did in the game</br></br></br>  <br>This.

CGI has been cheaper than hand animation for a long time. The appeal is too strong to escape it forever.</br>  Miyazaki is a hack. I would love to see a hideo kojima film.  <br> hideo kojima <br>Who?</br></br>   CG <br>I want this meme to die and Miyazaki to fuck off, he has a good few films but fuck him.<br><br><br>You might get your wish since hes been sacked from konami.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Iwata dies <br> and Miyazaki lives to do shit like this <br>There truly is no justice in this world.</br></br></br>  <br>something something all he makes is movies joke</br>  <br>Makes Metal Gear Solid even though he hates video games.</br>  Sad. In ten years there will be no more good animation. The only animation you'll find will be shorts on Youtube. It will be dead as a storytelling medium. It may survive as small pieces of deep art, but nothing big will remain.  <br>HOLY FUCK IWATA IS DEAD?</br>  <br>Check /v/.</br>  It's only a 10 minute short, you fags. Read the article.<br>Also, I'm pretty sure he will manage to do an excellent work as always. He always puts everything he has into his creations.</br>  <br/>  <br>I'd rather not, I know even then it will be console war shit posting and people throwing company related Buzzword.</br>  <br>Emo weeb shit.<br><br>No thanks.</br></br></br>  <br> old man gets bored and wants to make a 10 minute short <br> /co/ spergs on /a/ <br>In the source of your article it has a quote from over a year ago where Miyazaki even says CG isn't bad, and it's just a tool.</br></br></br>  <br>Wow thats pretty depressing. Looks like nintendo is dead.</br>  When is he retiring?  <br>Actually, this might be the shaking up it really needs.<br>Iwata, bless his heart, was not cut out for being a CEO.</br></br>  If the hindu monkeys at Pixar and Disney Movies can shit out good looking stuff I'm pretty sure Miyazaki will be able to do good looking CGI.  Why is this thread infested with /v/ermin?  <br>That's /co/mblr for you</br>  <br>Nah he was responsible for the gimmicks like the Wii U but he was the only thing stopping them from becoming a mobile phone company. Mobile games and those statue things are go.</br>  <br>His umpteenth retirement will be announced in December</br>  <br>He only said he retired from making long animated films. He never said he retired from working on other projects.</br>  Ronya had it's good moments (but also bad ones), no judging until i see it  <br>that looks like shit</br>  <br> weeb shit. <br/></br>     Miyazaki <br> hack <br><br>pick two</br></br></br>  <br>But I can see it now and it looks like eye cancer.</br>  <br>How could those faces get any more lifeless?</br>  <br>the "hack" thing is just a meme. Most of those who use this word haven't even watch one single movie from him</br>  <br> /co/ <br>What?<br>It's still anime not /co/ material. <br><br>And CGI films in anime already exist.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no, /co/ is laughing because they've seen where this path leads.</br>  Miyazaki doesn't like making anime anymore. That's why he'll never make anything good again. Because his heart is not at the right place.  <br>Who is this semen demon?</br>  since he started with his hipster complains his overall quality has go down quite a bit  <br>Contrary to popular belief /a/ doesnt hate CGI all that much except for a few bigoted individuals. What we hate is CG in 2D series used lazily to replace actual animation. It's equivalent to your board's hate of flash animation when it's used to animate an entire series rather than being used to animate a large amount of frames relatively quickly and cheaply. Full CGI series can be great. Knights of Sidonia is well liked here.</br>  <br>Stop projecting.</br>  <br>Projecting what?</br>  <br>You're imagining that most of /a/ has a similar opinion to you.</br>  <br>This is how it starts.</br>  <br>Sidonia looks like unfiltered ass. Stop accepting RWBY-tier shit from hack studios. Same goes for Expelled from Paradise. If you watch anime for the plot and accept awful-looking shit you need to reevaluate your life.</br>  <br>I hope you never get better bait</br>  <br>Sidonia looks that way on purpose. RWBY was made in mmd. Thanks for demonstrating you know fuck all about animation.</br>  <br>What possible difference does it make if it looks like shit on purpose?</br>  <br> Um it's supposed to look like that. That's just their style. <br/></br>  <br>You realize early plans for the Sidonia anime looked different and that the frame rate was intentionally lowered for the Japanese audience right?</br>  <br>Regardless of intentions, it looks bad.</br>  <br>Wasn't he supposed to be retired?<br>Literally the rolling stones of chinese cartoons.</br></br>  <br>Again, what possible difference does that make?</br>    <br> hideo kojima <br><br>Literally who?</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, retard.</br>  <br> since they don't use it as a crutch </br>  <br> wanting an anime about memes </br>  Are you a true man that believes big tits deserve the number one priority of any girl in anime character design?  You wouldn't know what to do with them even if you got the chance, loser.  <br>Tits are life,<br>Ass is hometown<br><br>Both are great and should be given the care they're due</br></br></br></br>  <br>Squeeze them, slap them around, suck them. What else?</br>  No. The size of breasts need to compliment the body type.<br><br>A loli with massive tumours is unappealing. Likewise, a Christmas cake, or librarian type character with mosquito bites is just as confusing.</br></br>   Came into this thread <br> Expecting it to break out into cowtits vs dfc brigade <br> See  and  and  <br><br>I'm proud of you, /a/</br></br></br></br>  <br> Likewise, a Christmas cake, or librarian type character with mosquito bites is just arousing </br>  <br><br>Hey, a girl's hometown is important too.</br></br>  bodies are bind to the character, they are completely irrelevant if the girl is shit.  I like large breasts on intimidating girls    As long as the face is cute and the body relatively slender I can appreciate all body types. <br><br>Big boobs, Small boobs, Petite butts, Big butts, DFC, DFA. <br><br>All can be delicious on the right girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much this. If the face is good then I'm down. There's appeal in almost all body types. <br><br>I'm a little picky about legs and hips but when it comes to tits and ass size I don't care much.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Large oppai will always be first place in my heart but I agree.</br>  <br>fuck tits, fuck ass, all that matters is face, hair and midriff.<br><br>midriff&gt;all.</br></br></br>  No, I'm a fictional man.  I believe in contrast.<br><br>Big isn't big if everything is big.<br><br>Flat isn't flat when everything is flat.<br><br>Only with contrast can one appreciate the full spectrum of sizes. Like a real gentleman.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    Of course<br><br> all can be delicious on the right girl. <br><br>That's indisputable. <br>Big tits do add a lot to the girl's appeal though.

Unfortunately we will never have hand threads. I hate you all.</br></br></br>  <br>I agree 100%<br><br><br>Hands are a god tier fetish. The fact that feet fags are more widespread than hand fags is a sin.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm a sucker for black haired big breasted onee-sans.</br>  <br> the fact that feet fags are more widespread than hand fags is a sin. <br><br>No reason you can't enjoy both</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'd love to snu-snu with Yuugi.</br></br>  <br><br>Unfortunately there's not nearly as much art that focuses on legs.</br></br>  Breasts&gt;Neck&gt;Midriff&gt;Thigh&gt;Shoulder<wbr>&gt;Back&gt;Ass&gt;Feet</wbr>  <br>Who wouldn't?</br>  <br>I agree for the most part. <br><br><br>Most hands look the same in anime so there's not much appeal to it. Some artists can make hands look 10/10 though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>this is now a navel and midriff thread.</br>  <br> neck  <br><br>Finally someone who gets it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Neck and midriff are essential in making a pair of breasts look great.</br></br>  It all depends on the girl.<br><br>I like large breasts. I also like small breasts, short hair, long hair, tall girls, short girls, pale skin, tanlines, dark skin, and eyebrows.</br></br>  <br>But what kind of midriffs? <br>Soft tummies are the best. Not fat, just soft and shapely.</br></br>  <br>As if you can do all those towards 2D girls</br>  <br> breasts <br> neck <br> collarbones <br><br>Together they are easily the sexiest part of a woman.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does this make you feel anything?</br>  <br>Specifically I like the kind that forget/don't acknowledge they have large breasts.<br>I don't mind the type that remember they have them then start blushing and getting all girly but really prefer the kind are afraid to use them.</br></br>  <br>You can't do anything to a 2D girl. No body part would matter by that logic. <br><br><br>If you add pale skin you have perfect taste.</br></br></br></br>  <br> completely impartial to navels <br> completely enamored with midriffs <br><br>I am complex.</br></br></br></br>  <br>*Aren't<br>What I'm trying to say is I like confidence but not cockiness.</br></br>  <br>lewd tummies</br>  <br>She comes to mind. <br> no sex appeal <br>Huh?</br></br></br>  <br>My taste is pretty specific I guess. I like both DFC and DFA, the hips wide and the legs long. <br><br>Of course I can appreciate other body types, the above mentioned is just my favorite.</br></br></br>  <br>Soft, yet firm~</br>  Priority:<br>Face &gt; Weight (should be generally slim) &gt; skin colour (paler the better) &gt; legs (should be long and curvy) &gt; boobs (any size is fine as long as they are not retarded looking) &gt; ass (If she had nice legs she will probably have a good enough ass)</br>  I like traps.  <br>all kinda of tummies are great. only thing that is disgusting is outie navels fuck those.</br>  <br> If she had nice legs she will probably have a good enough ass <br><br>Not necessarily. I've seen a lot of exceptions to that. Define "good enough" ass.</br></br></br>      Thick eyebrows are precious and needs to be part of more character designs.  <br> outie navels <br><br>Those are pretty fucking gross. <br><br><br>Not him, but nice legs are usually accompanied by a decent ass in most cases. Now I prefer slender legs and small to medium butts so my stance on what a good ass is might differ from yours.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hips and legs are what truly matter the most. <br><br>I've seen people say they'd rather a girl with no hips and a good ass than the opposite. Will never understand. <br><br>If you don't care about hips that much you might as well fuck a guy with a nice ass.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>People usually think of ass and hips as a combo, but I agree with you completely. <br><br>Midriff, hips, legs and tits are the most important to me, in that order. Face being first place goes without saying.</br></br></br>    <br>Her ass is mostly covered. You need a better example than that</br>  What do you guys think of bodies like Chiyos?  <br>She is slender and lovely</br>  Fuck boob pillows<br>Fuck ass pillows<br>Fuck lap pillows<br>I just want a tummy pillow.</br></br></br>  <br>Breasts do give life to infants, and grant dreams to all men .

The empire conquers large swath of territory and rapes and pillages treating everyone else like commoner scum. Hell lets just make the bunny race getting owned the Rape of Nanking or some shit. It's not a 100% retelling but its meant to mirror it. Japan was once the very enemy they're fighting and thats what draws me into it. Hell the ex-based prime minister even commented on it. He doesn't want japan to make the same mistakes of imperialism as they and all of humanity have been doing. They know as a nation both the feeling of overwhelming victory without end as an empire and overwhelming defeat at the hand of a righteous democracy. I guess if that social commentary doesn't tickle your fancy you might just not like it.</br>  <br>Well, shit.</br>  <br>Okay good. No degeneracy racemixing with elves. Elves are really the worst.<br><br>Great taste.</br></br></br>  <br>Civilization 5</br>  <br>Good luck. Not a single novel has been translated, so hopefully you can read moon. <br><br>If the manga never ends serialization this would take place approximately around... chapter 170. (since at the current speed it's about 23 chapters a book) Quite a ways to go.</br></br></br>  <br>I heard somebody say, "War never changes". What a bunch of bullshit. Give me a tactical nuke and I'd change this motherfucker real quick.</br>  <br> Not a single novel has been translated </br>  oh well, at least I'll get this in the anime...      <br>Now the nips get to experience the same feeling as americans when watching apache gun camera footage on jewtube</br>       Rori cutting people down while helicopters rain down fire to the sound of the Flight of the Valkyries <br><br>You better not fuck this up japan</br></br>  <br><br>From a writing (and balance) standpoint, one-sided stomps get boring after the first couple times. If there's no tension or real conflict then what's the point of even watching? Might as well just make it a SoL.</br></br>  <br>best girl</br>  <br>But I long to see the emperor get the shit beaten out of him  like his son <br><br>I wonder if that will happen, what with the elevens still having an emperor and shit</br></br></br>  <br><br>Does he give her the dick?</br></br>  <br>no, dark elf interrupts</br>  Volume 7 extras<br><br>I didn't see these posted anywhere, so I scanned them.</br></br>  <br>fucken dark elf... she didn't even end up in the harem iirc</br>    <br> moonrunes </br>  <br><br>I should have known. A typical otaku-pandering series like this would never let them go that far.</br></br>  <br>they need to mop up whatever left standing</br>  <br>Except it's the emperor's people who suffer, to no fault of their own, while the emperor's agenda is actually furthered by killing off his people. Our purpose of securing the area around the gate is not helped by bringing chaos to this region.</br>  <br>Chill. <br>The book just came out in June, and there's no scanlation of it. <br>In fact this scan might be the first raw even available.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This is how I feel about Kanji. What the fuck Japan do you really need so many fucking symbols?</br></br>  <br> they need to mop up whatever left standing <br><br>Pretty sure that's a test. There were no american soldiers marching on Hirosima and Nagasaki. It's even worst in a way, they walk towards that shit for nothing</br></br></br>  <br>You know practically everyone else other than Itami has sex scenes, right?<br>Well ok, not everyone, just like 3 or 4 other guys.</br></br>  <br>They actually do a decent job of defending nearby places and establishing relations with those places. It's advancing armies that get the shit blown out of them</br>  <br>They are from moon, anon. They are not even human to begin with.</br>  <br>Fuck off Trombley.</br>  <br>Im taking you mean the Soviets and the Germans.</br>  <br>A typical Japanese only knows about 3000 kanji characters, mate. <br>That's peanuts compared to Chinese which doesn't use any alphabet support like Japans' kana system, and entirely in hanji. You need to know like 10,000 for Chinese literacy.</br></br>  I saw the female soldier in the anime and she doesn't look anywhere near as awesome as the manga...<br><br><br>I assume you're trolling</br></br></br>  <br>With as sexual goth loli, she's eventually gonna force Itami to sex her, she has physical desires that she is very vocal about</br>  <br>Sound's like you belong to /m/<br>Welcome mate a mighty army of your brothers in arms welcome them to there comradely Get the fuck in there!<br/></br></br>  Just watched the episode.<br>Is it wrong if I got a boner?</br>  <br>You will never carry her out of danger and fondle her in the process</br>  <br>hahahah.</br>  <br>Bull shit post that shit or link it &amp; I'll pick up gate but until I'm proven wrong I got to say you are full of shit!</br>  <br>HE WAS TRICKED, WASN'T HE?</br>  <br>Why can't she give in?</br>  <br>A-1 is trying to appeal to the idol shitters.</br>  <br>Kanji/Hanji system is not that hard at all. <br>They are not phonetic language like English, they are Logogram. Sort of like pictograms. <br>Basically each character represents a meaning, instead of pronunciation.<br><br>You might be thinking that's way too complex reading this, but it's not. <br><br>Can you identify a mountain? A river? A twisting river? A fall? A rock? A tree?<br>You can right?<br><br>That's how the characters work. Just like you can identify thousands of different imagery, you can identify thousands of characters. <br><br>For example, mountain is 山. It looks like a mountain, right? That's how you memorize it. <br>Now, the kanji 山 only has information that "it's a mountain", not how you actually "say" it. <br>Japanese would read that as "Yama". A Chinese would read that as Shān. But they both would know it means a "mountain". <br><br>See, not that hard at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> in color <br>Today is a great day.</br></br>  <br>well done. I'm impressed.</br>  <br>First it was a cellphone, then it was dark elf bitch, it's gonna happen, she will force him to fuck her so that she won't become bloodthirsty</br>  <br>That's the same show with a kamikaze C-130?</br>  <br> I assume you're trolling <br><br> Democratic nation with advanced technology <br>Worker's democracy that developed industrial superpower from feudal backwater in 20 years<br> crazy autocratic society <br>Nazi Germany in a nutshell<br> Proceeds to actually improve the country <br>German Democratic Republic</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the real heroes of this anime are the the orcs, damn they march against fucking tanks with no armor</br>  <br>Oh for fuck's sakes this manga is full of sex scenes.

No one broke ranks when they were getting annihilated?   we just butchered thousands of helpless men as they tried to charge at our fortification   <br>Oh gosh, she is so wonderful. I can only be so erect.</br>  This shit is vaguely reminding me of Those Who Hunt Elves. Except in that one their tank runs out of oil but they get a spirit to inhabit it so it can run around and stuff and the military girl was always setting up explosive traps.  <br>She's pretty cute.</br>  <br> twisting events <br>you should write for rolling stone or some equally gay pinko liberal paper</br></br>  <br> Those Who Hunt Elves <br>This was a fun little series. Also had the right amount of ecchi.</br></br>  <br>gotta tongue twister for ya girl. Dare you try it?</br>  <br><br>I guess I have found my true love. Off with me to pick this back up, then.</br></br>    <br>and she's not used to her body yet. Will you help her break it in, anon?</br>  <br>Giving in would result in her slaughtering everything with pulse she sees.</br>  <br>But the japanese also had guns, just like the U.S.... Give those 100.000 romans guns and see that battle again, it would go completely different.</br>  <br>I want to fuck her senseless. Literally all loli vampire/supernatural girls with attitude makes my dick hard.</br>  <br>It doesn't change in the sens that if you nuke something, all that would remain is rubble and corpses...</br>  <br>It would be the same because the JSDF had artillery.</br>  <br> Hey, what did you think after seeing Giselle? <br> Hmm, let me see... <br> Big Fat Blue Tats <br> The hell were you looking at!? <br> URGH <br> Dammit <br> Someone's talking about my freaking blueness again. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rory: So, what did you think of Gisele?<br>Itami: Hmm.. blue boobs?<br>Rory: Is that what you were looking at!?<br>Itami: Ow!<br><br>Gisele: *sneeze*<br>Gisele: Goddamit. Someome must be calling me blue again... sheesh.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I really don't know what to think about the blue thing. Guess I'll just have to get used to it. Are all the dragonkin blue?</br></br>  <br> helpless men <br><br>You mean, men who killed a few thousands of your actual "helpless" civilians, and charging at your borders to do the same?<br>Do you actually know what you're typing?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Very gently. Or rough. I don't know if I would have a choice in the matter.</br>  <br><br><br>My thoughts were centered around him cumming after being hit by the girl. Then The blue girl leaking cum from her mouth while holding a dildo-ish thing.</br></br></br>  <br>That is unexpectedly cute</br>  am i the only one who thought persia was a tranny in the manga?  <br>I think it depends on which clans. <br>After all, the dragons have multiple colors themselves.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>BRB, scanning Gisele in maid outfit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's also dumb as a box of rocks. She gets herself into debt later because of it and has to work it off.</br>  <br>This would be the coolest shit in a vidya. Just marching on a mushroom cloud. I don't even care that everyone's gonna die from radiation.</br>   all this 40k stuff no elves bullshit <br> elves are sluts blah blah blah <br><br>This decade sure is shit. Why cant you fags go on about this to zombies rehashes or tsun shit all the time?</br></br></br>  <br>just keep hitting then</br>   But seriously 0 deaths on jap side? The guys disguised as bushes on the first Alnus battle couldv'e gotten trampled on or got noticed too quickly and beheaded. Death from wyvern corpse falling on someone. I'd expect them to have some kind of ninja unit able to get close. Heck even some friendly fire, some of these guys haven't seen real combat and people make mistakes all the time. <br><br>So this guy is butthurt about America getting its ass kicked in an onsen</br></br>  <br>Proceed</br>  <br>Owari no Seraph</br>  I for one can't wait for some decent Gate rule34 to show up  <br>He's right, you know?<br><br>Gateland is filled with all kinds of shit and magic.<br><br>I'm sure it would've been easy to get some ninja sneaky creatures/mages scout the enemy first.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not like they even got close. One group got to the outermost trench and that was it</br>  The show would be infinitely better with Russians, Murrikans, Fins, Poles, or Germans as the lead military.<br><br>JSDF is boring as fuck in fiction and in real life. All they do is make otaku jokes and try to make shit kawaii or puns.<br><br>The only thing left after that is nihon banzai fantasies because they're so boring.<br><br>Where are my armyfag assholes in a shitty sandbag clunker bunker piece of shit on a hill teaching local monster girls how to do Thriller and shadow bronco busting dragons while playing peekaboo in tanks and dancing in front of explosions?<br><br>Or my ruskies dancing around vodka or throwing knives at snake girls to pass the time.<br><br>Or the Fins, the fucking glorious Fins.

No shenanigans.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  White maid waitress Gisele, forced to work off her debts.  <br> copy pasta <br><br><br>not only did the anime reworks hurt it along with the butthurt 50 cent chinese posters now there is copy pasta. <br><br>gate threads are doomed.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Or the Fins, the fucking glorious Fins. Oh the shenanigans. <br><br>Why, what do the Fins do?</br></br></br>  <br>stereotypical slav/nords i assume.</br>  <br>They drink vodka and kill themselves.</br>  <br>So fuck off /a/ and go make your own, honky<br>What the fuck is stopping you?</br></br>  <br><br>This epic "anyone criticizing Gates bullshit is just a butt mad American" meme is really fucking retarded.<br><br>He's completely right, "friendly" fire happens all the time especially amongst inexperienced units. I'm not going to go "swords can beat guns blah blah blah" and I can totally see no casualties occurring because of the standard legionaries but the fact that artillery hasn't even maimed anyone from close range fire support or someone hasn't even accidentally shot a returning scout in the dark is kinda bullshit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> forced to work off her debts <br>Why isn't she doing that naked?</br></br>  <br>Did you actually watch the battle?<br>Did you not see how the enemy never even got as close to a mile?<br>How the FUCK do you friendly fire when target is miles away and all allies are nearby?<br><br>How about before complaining about retarded meme, stop posting retarded shitposts. yourself.</br></br></br></br></br>  any good doujins yet?  <br>What close range fire support? What scout returning in the dark? It was an engagement right out of the gate, with artillery at slow moving targets in the distance while everyone set up in dense formation close to the main force because no one had to worry about enemy artillery of any kind.</br>  <br>It's not too farfetched when your enemy is wearing full battle dress that looks completely different from yours, even in silhouette. A man in armor wielding a sword stands completely different than a man in a combat vest holding a rifle.</br>  <br><br><br>That hasn't been the only battle in the series though you fucking retards and when I mention the friendly fire bit I'm talking about at the various camps as they make way into the empire.<br><br>Fucking hell, do you think everyone has only watched the damn anime? <br><br><br><br>This is legit the only decent fucking answer that wasn't made by a retarded animeonly baby. Thank you, I completely didn't think about that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Mermaid Camie/Kemy drunk on aphrodisiac wine, right before the great mermaid orgy.<br><br>And yeah her name sounds incredibly close to the certain mermaid from One Piece.</br></br>  <br>Go to sleep malloperator.</br>  <br> various camps as they make way into the empire. <br><br>Clue me in on this "various camps" you are talking about. <br>JSDF made no such advancements, only sent small squads out mostly for info gathering. <br><br>JSDF did not, at any point, advance troops and seize control of Empire land. Ever. <br>And I've read the entire Season 1, so go ahead. Tell me. Which novel, what page.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Right now, Meikon! Meikon!  <br> Fucking hell, do you think everyone has only watched the damn anime? <br>The anime and the show follow a small squad around for the most part, whenever it's not focusing on the magic harem around the MC. I'm sure there may or may not have been FF incidents, but who the fuck cares? Why does this bother you so much? It had no reason to show up in the context of the particular events the story is following. If you want some Band of Brothers slice of life shit go write your own fanfiction.</br></br>  <br> assume he's replying to an anime only <br> gets told by novelfags </br></br>  <br><br>Ah so these squads never slept and never set up camp, good to fucking know.</br></br>  He's so handsome now.  <br>Of course they did, but the handful of these "squads" didn't fucking shoot each other, retard. <br><br>If you don't know anything about the story, stop pretending you do. Go away.</br></br></br>  <br><br> JSDF made no such advancements, only sent small squads out mostly for info gathering. <br>Does the little setup they had in the red light district in the capital not count? <br><br>not that guy btw</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Now </br>  <br> We never saw them use the bathroom <br> What bullshit, soldiers shit and piss all over the place </br></br>  Am I the only one who always thinks of the second code geass opening while listening to GATE's opening?  <br>He's talking about friendly fire in large combats situations, no?<br>Do you really think a squad composing of less than ten people constantly shoot each other to death in normal operations all the time?</br></br>  <br>So this guy is butthurt about Americans getting their asses kicked in an onsen</br>  <br> He's talking about friendly fire in large combats situations, no? <br>I was thinking JSDF operations in general. <br><br>maybe we're not all on the same page.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Shit happens, just ask Pat Tillman. <br><br><br><br>Epic meme.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most likely, and trying to troll with a different angle pretending to not be one. <br>And failing pretty terribly.</br></br>  <br>So you are saying, that JSDF operations have a HIGH PERCENTAGE of soldiers shooting each other even in small scale operations. <br>Japs are so retarded even if they are trained soldier, in a SQUAD mission, they shoot each other up all the time. <br><br>This is what you are reducing your argument to?<br><br>Are. You. Fucking. Retarded?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are you so agitated bro? Yes, irl there would inevitably be losses for the japs even if it were a simple jeep accident inside the base. Presumably you don't see it because it doesn't add much to the story, at least until now</br>  <br>He had it coming</br>  <br>To even suggest that glorious nipponese soldiers could EVER make a mistake is to be an assmad American anon, you don't want to be an assmad American do you?</br>  <br> Japs are so retarded even if they are trained soldier, in a SQUAD mission, they shoot each other up all the time. <br>accidents happen, and they don't even need to involve a firearm.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm agitated because the simple suggestion that someone could have made a mistake and gotten injured even if it's not that relevant to the story seems to be high fucking treason.</br></br>   draw a fox <br> call it a wolf <br>Why is this allowed?</br></br>    <br>that's a fox</br>  <br>That's a fox you retard</br>  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honsh<wbr>u_wolf</wbr>  A best sister.<br>A best everything.</br>  <br>But how can she be best sister when Izumi is best sister</br>  <br>She's an alcohol and it's destroying her family.</br>  I think you accidentally posted a picture of the wrong sister.  <br>We're posting best sisters, not worst sisters.</br>  Best nee-san.  <br>They all have problems.</br>  <br>Kazue may be divorced but she's holding the family together pretty much on her own.</br>  <br> you will never lick Kazue's butthole after a long day of court <br><br>why even live?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes!</br>  <br>W-what is going on here?</br>  <br>I want to take care of her.</br>  <br>W-WHAT IS HAPPENING?</br>  <br><br>He's putting heat pads on her because she has some muscle condition where she gets pain.</br></br>  <br>Oh, so that's what it was.</br>  <br>Brotherly love</br>  <br>I want to  hug her tenderly. </br>  <br> Selfish <br> Slut <br> Drunk <br> Loud <br>No she's shit. Then again all the onee-sans are..<br><br> is perfection though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cow tits <br> drunk <br> wastes money <br> isn't Izumi or Nazuna <br>Nah.</br></br></br></br></br>  Remind me, /a/. Why do they never see their mom and why does Katanashi not want to see her?  I just started watching it, but im wondering, is there actual romance at some point?  <br>She's a combination of all his sisters' worst traits and he blames her for their personal failings. She's a 7 foot tall mean, bossy alcoholic whose boozing led to complications in Izumi's birth, causing her to develop a degenerative muscle condition.</br>  <br>It's a comedy, not romance. Things do develop with Todoroki and Sanji, eventually.</br>  <br>Assuming this season is the last one and ends like the manga does, yes there is some actual romance. Very little, but it's there.</br>  <br>Wow, that's fucked up.</br>  <br> whose boozing led to complications in Izumi's birth, causing her to develop a degenerative muscle condition. </br>  <br>I want her to marry me and take care of me and rape me.</br>  <br><br>You guys are fucking faggots.<br><br>Nothing wrong with liking alcohol. It just means that she's a laid back girl that likes to have fun. Not necessarily a bad trait. And how is she a slut if she found her one true love? <br><br> implying cowtits is a bad trait <br>Fuck outta here faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to buy izumi cute dresses  <br>I haven't seen that in a while.</br>  <br> And how is she a slut if she found her one true love? <br>Ayyy</br></br>  <br>Drinking alcohol is fine, but when it's a defining trait of hers and she is seen continuously drunk, that is another. Try defending Alcoholism.</br>  <br>She's not killing or hurting anybody, just having fun. Get off her case, party pooper.</br>  <br>Alcoholism is great. The bigger issue is that she is obnoxious and incompetent while drinking and is constantly very drunk rather than simply compulsively drinking.<br>The only reason alcoholism is bad simply because it's a vice and any kind of crutch is bad whether it's cleaning or exercise. If you're reliant on it, it shouldn't be around. It's slightly worse than those because as a vice it invites other issues if done wrong but it's nowhere near as bad as stuff like gambling or stealing which are inherently damaging no matter how you look at it. <br>Alcoholism ranges from harmless to a money sink, to a health issue, to livelihood destroying/family breaking for sure but it still has range.</br></br></br>  <br>This</br>  When she eventually snaps...  <br><br><br><br> being a useless drunk is cool! <br><br>I like this. Being a Foreman at work I already know who the drunkards are and assign them the most work. Their pissing, bitching and moaning while they sweat like whores in church is most gratifying. Vowing to not drink again only to get shitfaced that night and come in drunk/hangover and then I assign them more manual labor. <br><br>It sustains me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  drunk waifu is best waifu  <br>Look at this square ass faggot. I bet you have no friends and no one likes you.</br>  <br>Are you my dad, because he's been doing this to his crew for like 30 years.</br>  i want to be pet by takanashi-kun  <br> divorced <br>No man likes a bossy cunt. MC has good life lessons from his sisters though. He knows what type of women to completely avoid.</br></br>  <br>what if it is your dad</br>  <br>This should bother me why? Unless you'd like to work for me? Come on over.<br><br>Yes.</br></br></br>  <br>Not saying it should bother you, just pointing it out. You can be happy in your pathetic, miserable ''no fun allowed'' life while people have fun. To each their own.</br>  <br>Not going to work drunk and/or severely hungover isn't living a "no fun allowed" life, it's just being a base-level functioning member of society.</br>  <br>If this is baitoza, then it's the bait of the baits, one-shots both Gilgabait and Baitrou.<br><br>No seriously salsa plz? Is this real life or a sea of Fanta?</br></br></br>  <br> You can be happy in your pathetic, miserable ''no fun allowed'' life <br><br>I am happy thank you. But you, you stay buttblasted over my work ethic lazy deadbeat bum.</br></br></br>  <br>Fair enough, but it's not like Kozue goes to work hungover so why did the faggot bring work into the whole conversation in the first place?<br><br><br>I don't give a fuck about your work ethic, It's not like I'm working for you.</br></br></br></br>  Do people actually find alcoholics appealing?  <br>You should since you sound like a spoiled little brat. A good day's manual labor while get that terrible shit outta you.</br>  <br>Only when I'm fucking them senseless in the bathroom.</br>  <br><br>muh nigga</br></br>  <br> I accidentally posted a picture of the wrong sister. <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br>  <br> only when I'm masturbating furiously into my hand at the thought of having sex with an alcoholic whore </br>  <br>It'll be glorious. too bad we'll never see it.</br>  <br>I do.

Also, he prefers DFC.</br>  I remember when Working!! threads were full of conspiracy theories about how it's propaganda to pull us out of our NEET life, now the threads are full of normalfags. Did the userbase on 4chan change or did the propaganda actually work?  <br>SICK FUCK</br>  <br>Well, it sure as hell didn't work on me, so the former.</br>  <br>Will this get adapted?</br>  <br>Of course, this season is the last.</br>  <br>4chan has always had high user turnover, but board culture on /a/ these days does seem a lot more normalfaggy than it did 5 years ago. Probably unavoidable when the current mods are normalfags themselves who drove away a lot of posters.</br>  <br> GULP GULP GULP <br> PAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH </br></br>  <br>Isn't it too behind?

She's damn near 30 years old and has to be coddled by a teenager</br></br></br>  <br>They run into each other later on, and Kirio takes a liking to her because she's cute.

She's a lazy bum who uses her "weakness" as justification to order people around.</br>  <br>ah so she is poisoning herself makes sense too</br>  <br><br>Where do you people get those ideas from?</br></br>  <br>I'll take good care of her. She's much better than a bossy bitch and a drunkard slut.</br>  <br>Being a worthless shut in isn't much better.</br>  <br>Kazue will never be bossy with you</br>  <br><br> worthless <br><br>but everything in life is equally worthless</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wanna take care of both Kazue and Izumi</br>  <br>it's not hard to put the pieces together</br>  <br>NOW he knows how it works!</br>  <br><br>Kyouko is fucking sex. I don't get why some people dislike her.</br></br>  <br>The new intro is just lewd with Kyouko sexiness.</br>  <br>Because aside from being kind of hot, she's a lazy gluttonous shit.</br>  <br>Just like me.</br>  <br> lazy <br>Sure.<br> gluttonous <br>Yeah.<br> bitch <br>Why?</br></br></br></br></br></br>   being attracted to a old hag   <br>He said shit, not bitch.</br>  <br>I can't into reading. Anyway, you get my point.</br>  <br> Implying cakes aren't the best </br>  <br>Because she works in a resturaunt and she<br> Eats more product than the cooks  <br> She's lazy as shit <br> She's not very helpful at all. </br></br></br></br>  <br>It don't matter--none of that matters. I'll tease her with sweets and cook delicious meals for her; trading them for disgusting sexual favors.</br>  <br>Not now boner</br>  <br>She's the manager, therefore she has less work and can afford to be more lazy than the actual employees. Are people that mad about her eating that much? You guys are fucking stupid. Especially if you consider her backstory which explains why she's like that.</br>  It matters to me, then again I cook, so her being a lazy bastard who does nothing but eats really strikes me in my hate-space  <br> She's the manager <br> therefore she has less work <br> and can afford to be more lazy than the actual employees. <br>Kill yourself. No, I'm not going to argue this, just kill yourself please.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kazue needs to find another beta to marry and boss around.<br>I'll take care of Izumi and Nazuna.</br></br>    <br>And even worse, it doesn't matter how the food tastes. She's just an insatiable black hole. She will also trust anyone that feeds her.</br>  <br> Nosebleed <br><br>Yes</br></br></br>  <br>So what the reason then? Only backstory I've seen for her was her hoodlum days when she was with Yachiyo.</br>  <br>This doujin made no sense at all, who would let their pet be used by others like that?</br>  <br>I thought they were leasing them out for money.</br>  I wonder why Takanashi kept doing Jojo poses, i can't take this seriously.   The Takanashi Siblings <br><br> Eldest sister (Kazue) - Divorced with her husband when she realized that the one she truly loved was his younger brother. Became a lawyer to serve as a stepping stone to become a politician in hopes that one day she will legalize incest when elected into parliament <br><br> 2nd eldest (Izumi) - Novelist specializing in incestuous romance between brother and sister until the editor wanted her to write other type of romance and the piles of crumbled paper is proof that she's struggling to write anything other than sibling incest. Indulge in a pampered and dependent lifestyle with her younger brother tending to her needs <br><br> 3rd eldest (Kozue) - Constantly gets drunk after being dumped by guys she dated every time she moaned her brother's name when having sex <br><br> Youngest (Nazuna) - Cunning and manipulative for her age, she manipulates her older sisters in order to protect her precious older brother from being 'bullied' by them <br><br> Only son (Souta) - Knows nothing about his sisters secretly lusting for his cock. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hot.</br>  <br>Even his dad wanted to fuck him</br>  <br><br>You forgot Souta being a better girl than most girls</br></br>  <br/>  <br>do people in Japan still use flip phones?</br>  <br><br>they're transitioning; in any case, it was left by her dad</br></br>  <br>I can buy that. Other than Kazue they all seem to have a bond with Souta that's more than mere sibling affection, but I bet Kazue is just being tsun.</br>  would you download a poplar?  <br>Confirmed best girl<br><br><br>Surprisingly a lot of them still do, i still see em everywhere when i was there last year on vacation, tho mostly old folks use them</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>She only dates pure guys, and then they run away when she tries to rape them.</br>  <br>She must be wanting it so bad then, Souta-kun should help his sister.</br>  <br>She's a raving slut who's a virgin. Isn't it sad?</br>  <br>I don't remember Daisy at all. I'm rewatching season 2 for the sole purpose of finding her introduction.</br>  <br>It truly is, but funny too.</br>  <br>Kozue is probably the only Takanashi Minegishi doesn't like. With her endless bubbly optimism, she'd probably never snap at him.</br>  <br>She very clearly isn't a virgin, she's talked about sex before.</br>  <br>We're just joking, Anon.</br>  <br>What the fuck? The higher position you get, the less you have to work. You're a mongoloid if you don't understand that.<br><br><br>Yeah. that explains exactly why she's so lazy.</br></br></br></br>  Nazuna a shit  I haven't watched this season yet, is kantanashi still a beta cuck whiney ass fuccboi about his sisters being taller than him?  <br> The higher position you get, the less you have to work. <br>This is rarely true, you just do less grunt work. Management usually has a ton of paperwork and other shit to do and have to work ungodly hours as well as dealing with lots of responsibilities.<br><br>You'll find this is the case with most jobs. The whole "I'm the manager so I just sit around doing nothing all day" is just shit you see in TV.<br><br>Only the top CEOs can pull that shit and they're still busy as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Have you actually had a fucking job in your life? Or are you a retarded NEET? The higher up you are, you have to do even MORE work</br>  <br><br>NEET is love. NEET is life.</br></br>  <br>Exactly, less grunt work. Hence why we don't see her work her ass off in the show. Now, unless you haters tell me you want screentime of her doing paperwork for her to not be a ''lazy shit'', you guys are just fucking haters for no reason.<br><br><br>I just came back from my job and turns out it's a job where I get to do the shit job while supervisor does the clean job and gets to leave earlier than me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She very clearly doesn't even do paperwork you retard, the fucking owner even mentions how he has to catch up on paperwork whenever he comes back from searching for his wife. She literally does nothing but eat food and laze about, she's an active detriment to the restaurant.</br>  <br>You shut your mouth, YOU SHUT YOUR WHORE MOUTH!</br>  <br>Actually, though your position on CEO's is bullshit, Kyouko doesn't work, because as shown, she's got the work out of connections.<br><br>We've been shown the paperwork is done by Otoo.<br><br>Kyouko does very little.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If she was she'd be fired by now. Stop hating.</br>  <br>And I work in a restaurant, where both front of house and back of house managers have a huge load and a lot of responsibility. In no way do they have less work, and they're expected to perform the grunt duties if for any reason the grunt doesn't show up, in addition to a multitude of other responsibilities that still need to get done, even as they do it.<br>You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. <br>As for paperwork, she doesn't even do that, the big boss does that. She doesn't do anything except kick people out then hire thugs to beat them, which is a pretty bad thing to do. <br><br>Go eat a dick.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If she was she'd be fired by now. <br>This is a comedy, you know? You've seen her even call grunts to beat up customers who don't pay.<br><br> Stop hating. <br>Are you underage? You're being told and proven you're wrong. Stop bitching about that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If she was she'd be fired by now. <br> Applying real life logic to anime. <br>Yes and Yachiyo would also have been fired for carrying a weapon around at all times. And Yamada would have been fired for being a useless shit. And Inami would have been fired for being an legitimate physical threat to the male customers.<br><br>You're retarded.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kozue is known for being violent</br>  <br><br>Why are you using the anime comedy logic when it suits yourself. Okay so she doesn't work all that much so why does it matter to you considering it's a anime comedy? You guys call her a bitch for being lazy but fawn over Inami even though she punches everything that has a dick? Fuck outta here.<br><br><br>You're so fucking mad, it's hilarious. Keep sucking your manager's dick I guess. This is how you'll climb the ladder to not do shit at your job.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only when you dump her.</br>  <br>Inami has a legitimate mental issue and is actively attempting to fix it.<br><br>Kyouko is a lazy glutton and doesn't give a damn. Yamada is just as useless but at least she's funny and cute about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Typical. Fucking typical.<br><br>If she's cute, it gets a pass. Just kill yourself moeshit eater.</br></br></br>  <br>HNNNNNNNNG!</br>    <br>Perfect.</br>    <br> If she's cute, it gets a pass. <br>New to anime?</br></br>  <br> I-I'm not like that at all, b-baka <br>Just give it up, you sad alcoholic bore<br><br><br>Also, holy fuck at the state of this thread. You people are taking Working way too fucking seriously. <br><br>See you faggots on /sp/, I guess. Remember to say hi when you see a "who /a/ here" or "/a/ ww@" post</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is the new ED so great?<br><br>  Nazuna best sister. </br></br>  <br> Then again all the onee-sans are.. <br>I've seen people killing for less than that</br></br>  <br>New op is pretty based<br><br>OP1 &gt; OP3 &gt; OP2</br></br></br>  <br>I said typical meaning I'm not new considering I've seen this many times.<br><br>Get into reading comprehension, baka.</br></br></br>  Nazuna literally a best sister.<br><br>Izumi is the most erotic, however.</br></br>  <br>I agree. I didn't really like it at first but it grew really onto me after listening to it a few times.</br>  <br>Nazuna remains the most based even when placed in the most degenerate of fantasies.</br>  <br>I made this, but I haven't seen it reposted yet.</br>  Why do lolis in anime and manga like to eat meats?  Meat contains protein which is essential for growth so they can get bigger and stop being ogled by you gross disgusting neckbirds.  <br>I got your protein right here.</br>  <br>loli loev hamburgah</br>    Do you not like meat, OP?<br>Are you a fucking hippie?</br>  the internet loli ban is coming.<br><br>gel axed todd, h-f axed all loli, pah is moving in on all loli as we speak.<br><br>the end is near, folks. get ready.</br></br></br></br>  There is a lot of theories about it but no real loli-scientist really discovered why. The more common theory in the community is the one saying loli might need to build muscle to grow up but some loli scientists (like me) think they don't need to grow up and they eat meat to overcome the lack of proteins due to irresponsible oni-chan tachi who don't feed them semen. Those filthy unlolicon need to be punished.<br>Vegans have another but vegans sucks and meat is best girl anyway</br>  <br> lolis eating meats <br><br>lewd, reported</br></br></br>  <br>Those sites are shit anyway with horrible admins. The good sites will remain unchanged, so go away with your anti-loli conspiracy theories</br>  <br>So if you don't want a malnourished daughter/little sister, but want her to be vegan then you need to supply them with protein yourself?</br>  <br>Don't be vegan to start with. And provide prots, of course. Ask /fit/ how good it is, they know. #nohomo</br>  <br> neckbirds. </br>  <br> gel axed todd <br>you can still find all that stuff on pixiv. Gel grabs all its shit from pixiv anyway.</br></br>  <br>Meat eating loli &gt; grass eating loli</br>  <br> he doesn't want a grass fed loli <br><br>Literally the cleanest and most succulent lolis on the market anon, step up.</br></br></br>   eating red meats <br>Us lolis should avoid such testosterone-filled foods to maintain our cuteness, seafood is the best for a loli.</br>  <br>I got a fish for you to eat right here, *unzips fish*</br>  <br>Loli scientists are still working on alrernatives.<br>pic related.</br></br>  <br>The only alternative is my dick!</br>    <br>whoa</br>  <br>Sexts confirm.</br>  <br>Cause they have yet to find a good dick to suck from.</br>  <br>Ready to receive, papa~</br>  <br>But loli haet pizza.</br>  <br>O-okay, but make sure to hold my hand</br>  <br>try finding enough western loli on those sites.<br>funny how you ignored gel banning todd.<br><br> but western loli is shit <br><br>to a fucking newqueer pleb whos been into loli for 5 years, maybe.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit. That's the best get I ever got.<br>It was truely the voice of Jesus speaking through me. Loli are for sexing confirmed!</br></br>  <br>Why did you post without a name?<br><br>Why have you been missing so often lately?</br></br></br>  <br>Are you trying to claim another anon's get?</br>  <br> stealing gets <br>I always knew you were a fucktard but this is a new low.</br></br>  <br><br>We won't be fooled by his keikakku!</br></br>  <br>Nah it was me without a name.
