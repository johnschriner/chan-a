Basically what it is, it allows you to read and it shows you what words you know, and which ones you don't. It highlights new words in blue and words you had to look up before in yelllow, so its very easy to check<br><br> It's a paid service, but if you refer yourself 20 times, (you can pick any random email, no verification needed ) you can get 2000 words you don't know before paying, which is a lot.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't force yourself to use a J-J dictionary unless you're at the level where it actually helps you.

What does everybody here do? Do you start another deck for the new VN and prioritize mining that, or finish the past VN deck you were mining?</br></br>  <br>I make an Anki subdeck for each one and just do whichever I feel like doing.</br>  <br>Stop adding every word. Only add words at the pace you actually go through them, leaving a couple days worth as a buffer. Once you hit that limit, just focus on reading for the rest of the day and don't worry about other words.</br>  <br>That's the worst possible advice.

This website is by Tae Kim, a godsend to stupid gaijins who want to learn Japanese. This website covers Hiragana, Katakana, as well as grammar. It even has tracing practice sheets for Hiragana and Katakana to help with stroke order and shit.<br><br>You're not done with Hiragana and Katakana until you can fill out a chart. You must know how to pronounce each one, as well as having proper stroke order. Keep going until you can do that. Done? Then we get to the most tedious part of learning Nipponese: Kanji grindan.<br><br> kanjidamage.com <br>This site is written for bros, by bros. Kanji is just as simple as 1 + 2 = 3. I thought Kanji was scary until I saw this site, and then suddenly HOLY FUCK--IT ALL MAKES SENSE.<br><br>Now you're going to grind Kanji. Go through kanjidamage or whatever, and just learn to write each Kanji, pronounce it, etc. Once you've grinded about 1K Kanji, it's time to start reading some manga or VNs in Japanese. Find a Kanji you don't know?

The reading list says its <br> Recommend reading after picking up some basic vocabulary. <br>Does anybody have any recommendations for how far into the 6k deck I should get before starting it? I'm only ~600 at the moment and it seems too hard for now.</br></br>  I'm reading DoJG Beginners .<br><br>This book is seriously helpful if you want to know how to form a coherent sentence in Japanese.</br></br>  <br>Yes, but I'm scared I'll miss some kind of foreshadowing or context, if I don't 100% understand something I start getting some panic attacks and can't continue until I do.</br>  <br> at the moment and it seems too hard for now. <br>Come back after another month of study as see how hard it seems then. Repeat the process till the point it doesn't seem too hard.</br></br>  <br> that pasta <br>Nostalgia. <br> that image <br>We have to start using it for the OP.</br></br></br></br>  sorry guys, this is a really stupid one, but whats the name of the channel with that dude living in japan and he teaches it while drinking alcohol and swearing and stuff? he is really popular but im having trouble finding him.  <br>raw teacher</br>  <br>nono sempai</br>  <br><br>pls</br></br>   live in Japan <br> can read lots and lots of kanji <br> can barely write any of them worth a damn because I've never sat down and studied <br><br>Curse you, smartphone-driven society.</br></br></br></br>  <br>含みを持たせた</br>  <br>This scares me too. I should really incorporate some writing practice outside of writing down new words from anki.</br>  <br>This happened to my brother also.</br>  <br>It really only bites you in the ass when you have to write down things for applications or other documents.<br><br>Just don't be lazy about it like me. I'm normally not a lazy person, but my motivation to learn to write kanji just plummets when I have no immediate need to do it. I talk to all my friends via PC or smartphone, and the rest of the time is spent speaking verbally.<br><br>The idea of learning to write kanji and calligraphy dying out within a few generations is actually a pretty common topic on TV and whatnot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see calligraphy dying out completely, though. It will be like it is now in the west: regular populace can't write good looking cursive for shit, but there are people who give a shit and keep the craft alive.</br>  I've been done with core 6k for a while now, what now? Read some manga, played some dragon quest games, now I'm tired of enjoying myself. What can I do for learning that's structured and not fun? <br><br>Is translating shit not fun?</br></br>  <br>You can work through the sou matome or kanzen master books.</br>  <br>Oh, I know. Just saying that it's one of those fad topics in the media right now.<br><br> Is translating shit not fun? <br>It is if you like the material. Otherwise, it's boring and pretty thankless.</br></br></br></br>  I hate life  <br>日本語でもう一度</br>  <br>I can't read anything without having a panic attack, help.</br>  Anyone a bad enough dude to explain to me how 狙う works in passive form (Xを狙わされる)?

Learning kanji is a waste of time. The vast majority of Japanese is written in romaji.</br></br>  <br>熟語, words that have multiple kanji in them.</br>  <br>I see. What about kunyomi?</br>  <br>Google it, there's never not an 教えて question about this stuff.<br><br>http://chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/detai<wbr>l/q1168854246</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>nice 404</br>  <br>Could be this.<br> http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/leaf/t<wbr>hsrs/17168/m0u/</wbr> <br> (3) 夜もふけてきた <br> また、例文(3)のように同類の事柄が特定できない場合もある <br>But I don't know what the purpose is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nevermind you ungrateful faggot. Fuck off.</br>  <br><br>Just a heads up for you anon, if you should stumble across this post, that I've temporarily switched gears and are working on getting the Basic Dictionary of Japanese Grammar Anki deck out and uploaded in the mediafire folder with the other DoJG grammar page content. Resolved the issue of those two split lines with the second having an indent, in the usage field, with a dirty but workable <br> &lt;br /&gt;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp; <br>breaking the line and creating the indent. Expect it online within the next 24 hours, likely within the next 10 hours. <br><br> How long should decks for the other 2 volumes take? <br>The Intermediate volume is roughly a quarter way through editing and I will be putting the deck together when that is complete. Could be in a week, could be in three weeks. As the Advanced volume, well, I predict it will take roughly a month, give a week either side, after releasing the Intermediate deck, before the Advanced volume is fully edited, with give or take a few days for the deck to be released. <br><br>To give you an idea, the workflow is as follows:<br> edit docx file: fixing typos, adding missing sentences, adding formation tables, updating usage notes <br> save docx as .pdf <br> in dreamweaver copy/paste docx content into the current .html file in the mediafire account, updating content for the section <br> in exported deck/template from anki, using dreamweaver and notepad systematically fill html from tables into their formation columns; add spacing and indent to usage field from plaintext; add English sentences, volume/page information and grammar concept from plaintext; change in bulk the html tags from Japanese sentences in a text editor to correct tags for CSS colour for the concept and eventual close-deletions for a secondary card type, copy/paste Japanese into relevant fields in spreadsheet.  <br><br>Reason I've mentioned this in the more or less exact steps is to fill in the process for anyone interested in doing any of this themselves instead of waiting for me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it is</br>  <br>usually used when the kanji is on its own, with some hiragana at the end (okurigana)<br><br>note, that those aren't hard "rules" or anything, so expect that to be accurate in like 80% of the words you encounter.<br>That means, without actually knowing the vocab, you can never be sure which reading is the correct one, so you should learn vocab instead of learning readings on their own.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 日も暮れて、辺りには心地よい闇が降りている。 <br>Not that guy, but does this mean "The day has grown late, and around pleasant shadows have fallen"?</br></br>  <br>yeah</br>  <br>Why not just put a は there then? Why a も?</br>  <br>This is what DJT does to you.<br><br>You end up autistic like this.</br></br></br>  <br>Sweet, thanks for sharing the info with us. Looking forward to the decks.</br>  <br><br>も　gives the sentence a context, it' implying that other thing have happened that's related to the sun going down. basically it's just making the flow of the story better.<br><br>Also, 日が暮れるis usually used withが and not　は</br></br></br></br>  <br>but those are literally the first two lines, there is no context.</br>  <br>I don't see any problem with it being related to the first sentence...<br>Think of it as an "also" or "too" if that helps.</br></br>  <br>Stop reading it like you're a machine.</br>  <br>Explain to me how to not do it like a retard then, either it makes sense to me or it doesn't</br>  <br>If you use が it seems like they day grew late from then and that time might have passed<br>. も makes it obvious that there is no time gap.</br></br>  <br>If you already understand the difference it does seem like a small ting to get this confused about, but as a beginner things like these can be really confusing.</br>  <br>So it implies a connection to something unsaid. This is not an uncommon thing, you better get used to it. Basically, as the others have said, don't think so hard about it, rather _feel_ the sentence. The も doesn't change the meaning, but it adds depth, the sun going down is not the only thing happening, the whole atmosphere is changing. It adds ambiance in a way.</br>  Are there many good RPGs with Furigana? Or is it inhibiting language learning by relying on it?  <br>But how would I have known that if I didn't ask?<br><br>Nowhere in any grammar book I've read or J&gt;J dictionary I've read has it ever said anything about ambiance.</br></br></br>  <br>日も暮れて、人々も家に帰っていって。。。<br><br>Something like that maybe?</br></br></br>  <br>You could have realized it yourself, English works in a similar way.<br><br>Day has ended and...<br>Day has already ended and...</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not saying the も has a definition relating to ambiance that you would find in a dictionary. You have to infer that yourself.</br>  https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapan<wbr>ese/comments/3cylau/the_little_prin<wbr>ce_gradually_transitioning_into/<br>Why aren't you studying Japanese by combining English and Japanese sentences?<br> 僕 は showed 僕 の masterpiece the grown-ups に, and, “この drawing scary?” と askて tried. <br> その then は, 僕 は anymore だいじゃボア の stories も, primeval forest の 話 も, stars の 話 も しなかった </br></br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br>wat</br>  <br>It's not inhibiting anything since you're still learning vocab and getting used to grammar. Knowing a word makes learning the kanji that uses it easier when you get to it, anyway. <br>Still, there isn't much games with furigana out there other than boring stuff for grade schoolers like Pokemon and Doubutsu no Mori. A lot of older JRPGs and dungeon crawlers are pure kana, that shit is kind of a pain to read, but it works as practice.</br></br>  <br><br>Fortune Summoners exists, and it's great. Easy Japanese-wise, challenging gameplay-wise.</br></br>  <br>How do you "feel" what a sentence means anyway? I can feel that sentence meant "my anus tingles with excitement" but that doesn't make it right just because I "feel" that's what it means.</br>  <br><br>It's not と. も must mean specifically that something else does like the sun. <br><br><br><br>It can work, and the も particle contributes is the idea that what the sun does and what the people do is similar.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's not と. も must mean specifically that something else does like the sun.  <br><br>Yeah I think we're saying the same thing</br></br></br>  Think about this and also about how the time passes through the day.  The Japanese language has thus a unique grammatical structure and native lexical corpus whose idiosyncratic syntax and connotations condition the Japanese to think in peculiar patterns unparalleled in other human languages. The Japanese language is also uniquely vague. Foreigners who speak it fluently therefore, may be correct in their usage, but the thinking behind it remains inalienably soaked in the alien framework of their original language's thought patterns. This is the Japanese version of the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, according to which grammar determines world-view.  <br>Huh, I had no idea it had furigana, especially since it's a doujin game. I'll check it out.</br>  <br>On the other hand people can grow up equally fluent in very different languages. Such as Japanese and English.</br>  <br> 1. The Japanese race is a unique isolate, having no known affinities with any other race. In some versions, the race is understood as directly descended from a distinct branch of primates. <br> 2. This isolation is due to the peculiar circumstances of living in an island country cut off from the promiscuous cross-currents of continental history, with its endless miscegenation of tribes and cultures. The island country in turn enjoys a sui generis climate whose peculiar rhythms, the putative fact for example that Japan alone has four distinct seasons, color Japanese thinking and behaviour. Thus, human nature in Japan is, peculiarly, an extension of nature itself. <br> 3. The Japanese language has thus a unique grammatical structure and native lexical corpus whose idiosyncratic syntax and connotations condition the Japanese to think in peculiar patterns unparalleled in other human languages. The Japanese language is also uniquely vague. Foreigners who speak it fluently therefore, may be correct in their usage, but the thinking behind it remains inalienably soaked in the alien framework of their original language's thought patterns. This is the Japanese version of the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, according to which grammar determines world-view. <br> 4. Japanese psychology, influenced by the language, is defined by a particular cast of dependency wishes or desires that conduce to a unique form of 'human relationship', in which clearly defined boundaries between self and other are ambiguous or fluid, leading to a psychomental and social ideal of the fusion of ego and alter. <br> 5. Japanese social structures consistently remould human associations in terms of an archaic family or household model characterized by vertical relations, clan, and (foster-)parent-child patterns. As a result, the individual cannot properly exist, since groupism will always prevail. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's some weeabo shit if I ever saw it.</br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihon<wbr>jinron#Specific_theses_of_Nihonjinr<wbr>on</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Has the retard who wrote this ever actually interacted with Japanese people outside of any sort of formal setting?</br>  <br> Japan alone has four distinct seasons <br>What?</br></br>  <br>Reminds me of this.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ameri<wbr>can_exceptionalism<br>Everyone likes to imagine themselves as being special.</br></wbr></br></br>  <br>This is endlessly repeated by Japanese even today. Exchange students coming to my university from Japan never fail to mention it. It's kind of a running joke nowadays among students that care of them. <br><br>Anyway, it's supposed to mean that due to the Japanese islands being very horizonally oriented - aka going from north to south - you can at any given moment experience all 4 seasons at some 4 places in Japan. Basically it's always hot in Okinawa and always cold on Hokkaido... plus various temperatures between.</br></br></br>   Try reading a bit of Demon Gaze in JP <br> Despite it being simple as fuck I still only pick up on around 50% of it <br><br>Back to Anki I go, I guess.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, we have the same shit here in Russia, people just make up that bullshit to make themselves feel better.<br><br><br> Basically it's always hot in Okinawa and always cold on Hokkaido... plus various temperatures between. <br>That's not the only country that has that, though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That's not the only country that has that, though. <br><br>No shit, but tell that to the Japanese.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, we like to joke around about this too. But I'll hand it to Japan though, their 4 seasons are very distinct. I have 4 seasons in my country as well but at times autumn and spring can be interchangeable. That's not really the case if we look at Kyoto, with snow during winter, the mild to hot spring filled with sakura, the disgustingly hot and humid summer and mild autumn with bretty guud 紅葉 (where I live, shit just turns yellow and falls off). Are Japan unique in this sense though? Nope not at all.</br>   35GB of raw manga not in the CoR sitting on computer <br> upload speed/data cap too Australian to add any of it to the CoR. </br>  Oh, I didn't expect it to be this edgy.<br><br>What are you playing on this day, DJT?</br></br>  <br>I have two bookshelfs of stuff I could turn into high quality scans.</br>  <br>Love plus plus, son.<br>It's pretty nice for beginners, language wise.

I don't dislike her I just don't love her.<br><br>I will take Saiba clone over her any day.</br></br>  This was one of the worse harems because the girls had very little going outside of their relationships with the MC.<br>But it was a fun ride otherwise, so I didn't care much. But that describes my opinion of Hestia as well. I didn't care much.</br>  You can't really call them people, but yes.  <br>no</br>  hestia the bestia<br><br>as a goddess of marriage and fertility, she can supply the grandson of zeus with a soccer team worth of heroic demigod children</br></br>  <br>More than you can imagine.</br>  <br>Hestia a shit, Ryuu is better</br>  <br>I hate poorfags.</br>  <br>With popularity comes criticism.

There were too many jokes/pandering per second to try to keep your attention, which is fine if you like that but I've grown out of it years ago.</br>  I WANT TO BRUTALLY FUCKING FUCK HESTIA IN EVERY SINGLE HOLE SHE HAS JESUS FUCKING CHRIST I WOULD DO SO MANY FUCKING TERRIBLE HORRIBLE THINGS TO HESTIA THAT YOU WOULD NEVER EVEN THINK ABOUT SEX EVER AGAIN JUST OUT OF PURE SYMPATHY FUCK  <br>Why are you still here then?</br>  <br>B-because I'm lonely.</br>  <br>You're pretty desperate, aren't you.</br>  <br><br> jokes/pandering <br><br>like what?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The character is annoying and sounds retarded. Her outfit looks like terrible lingerie with absolutely zero class or lewdness. There's classy sexy, and there's lewd sexy, and this shitty outfit fits right into the middle, pleasing neither half of my brain.<br><br>And every single fucking stupid nip fuck is going nuts for it. 90% of the doujins at comiket are going to be this boring cunt having sex.</br></br></br>  Freedom descending to Earth and kick everyone ass. Best gundam moment ever.  <br>until she pays denbts</br>  Yes.  <br> 90% of the doujins at comiket are going to be this boring cunt having sex. <br>Bullshit.<br>50% of all doujinshi aren't even hentai.<br>30% of all doujinshi are touhou.<br>Another 20%(?) are kancolle.<br><br>Hestia sex will probably make up like 5% of the comicet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is really boring and pointless. Not to mention no one would shut up about her while this show was airing. The other girls are a lot better with pic realted being the best.</br>  <br> 30% of all doujinshi are touhou. <br><br>That is also bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br>There's 3 events. 1 for Fujoshi, one for Touhou fans, and 1 for doujin in general.</br>  <br>I like her looks and I fapped to her five-six times without ever watching the shitty anime she is from, but ultimately I don't see myself fapping to her a year from now or remembering her.<br><br>Danmachi was definitely no Kill la Kill.</br></br></br>  <br>I find her very annoying and I'm 6 eps in. She gets better, right?</br>  <br>Not as desperate as all of you Hestiafags looking for validation. OP's thread case in point.</br>  <br>No, but I just wonder what's so perfect about her. She seems just like any seasonal waifu.</br>  <br>You must be blind, anon.</br>  hestia a bestia    I love her very much. She is perfect waifu material. She is so cute and tiny, I wish I could pick her up and hug her.  How can you hate this face?  <br>She honestly wasn't as annoying as I expected her to be, but there's not much to like about her either.</br>  <br><br>I like Hestia she ain't bad I think I like Loki more though</br></br>  She's pretty, cute, devoted and smug.<br><br>Perfect.</br></br>  I want her to bully me with her feet.    <br>God tier taste.</br>  <br>Yes, for one reason.<br> She wasn't Lili </br></br>    <br>No. Its just a few trolls. /a/ clearly loves her.</br>    <br>I was there when you promised to post this in every Hestia thread but I never got the joke.</br>  I love her but I hate her show    First episode of God Eater in 10 hours but don't get your hope too high. Also Daisuki will be simulcasting this.  Damn look at those legs.  <br>Midriff is where it's at.</br>  <br><br><br>Is she going to be the only reason to watch this show?<br><br>I already played the game so I don't have any expectations story wise.</br></br></br></br></br>  Finally, the type shit chains are broken. Dawn of a new age for ufotable.  <br>The first episode might look okay, but it's downhill from then on for sure.</br>  <br>Pretty much.</br>  <br><br><br>Yeah, keep expectations low.<br>Best to set expectations from first three episodes rather than initial hype (not that there's much to hype from 1 PV, 2 CMs and 1 interview)</br></br></br></br>  so wait, they're combining MC's initialization with kota and putting Alisa there ASAP?<br><br>because hell in the game, Alisa doesnt come at the beginning</br></br>  Is there even a staff listing for the first episode? I guess Hirao is directing and on storyboards, but who is/are the animation supervisors?  <br>Alisa's comin in through a carrier.<br>Bet is that:<br>Ep 1: Introduction of everyone except Defence Team and Alisa, one or two missions, Lenka stuff, Lenka rushing out of Aragami wall, stuff happening, resolve that then show Alisa getting on carrier and saying some stuff.<br>Ep 2 might have her introduction there.<br><br>Pretty much cutting out unneeded missions and getting on with a solid pace.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh okay<br><br>he'd better have the only line the MC had in the game</br></br></br>  <br>I'm watching for Bugarally</br>  <br>No staff listing for first ep but there's this:<br><br> Original work <br>BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment Inc.<br> Director/Director of audiography <br>Takayuki Hirao<br> Character Design <br>Keita Shimizu<br> Art Director <br>Masaru Yanaka<br> Color Design <br>Emi Chiba<br> Director of Photography <br>Kentaro Waki<br>Shigeji Matsuda<br> CG Director <br>Masato Takizawa<br> Editing <br>Tsuyoshi Imai<br> Music production <br>Go Shiina<br> Opening theme <br>OLDCODEX<br> Animation production <br>ufotable</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>But what about the best side character?!</br></br>  Should I just play this game or is the story good enough to experience it on the superior medium?  <br>Until this sells like fucking garbage, driving them back to Type Moon.</br>  <br> story good enough <br><br>Not really. God Eater is just a Monster Hunter clone at heart, the story is pretty generic post-apocalyptic stuff. <br><br>You can't even waifu any of the characters</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You watch this for the visuals and music. That's it. The story is garbage.</br>  <br>that'd be pretty boring.<br>Considering the changed MC is supposed to be "hotblooded" and "headstrong", he's gonna be more involved than whatever gameMC kun was.<br><br><br>Lend me some tapes, Kouta<br><br><br>Oh his thing? Either replaced (he still might be kill tho) or written off.<br><br><br>Game is alright. It's pretty much carried by bullet customization and the battles.<br>Chances are there are already major changes in the anime compared to the game. Might be better to go for anime if gameplay isn't your thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Cheers, will just wait for the BDs</br></br>  <br> tfw no Monster Hunter anime. </br>  just another generic tsundere  <br>would you prefer a moe monster hunter anime or a gritty realistic one with lots of blood</br>  I want to cum inside Alisa's tits.  <br>What about Sakuya's tits?</br>  <br> Takayuki Hirao <br><br>I'm convinced. Like all anime, I'll wait for it to finish before watching it because fuck waiting weekly.</br></br></br>  <br><br>her design probably got the biggest improvement from ufo</br></br>  <br> tsundere <br>I just thought of her as a proud bitch as opposed to plain bitch, she's not that unfriendly from what I remember</br></br>  <br>The one that doesn't kill me of boredom.</br>  <br><br>I also dont think she is tsundere that much<br><br>especially in the game, first she is just haughty, then you realize she is full of PTSD, then you help her with that, and she on your dick 24/7</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Time to post comparisons</br></br>  <br>i dont really remember much of the game, i think she gets along better with sakuya rather than the player</br>  <br>She's only kind of bitchy to Kota and standoffish to Lindow at first, she doesn't rely on the player initially but still remains indifferent but approachable towards him, like anyone else would when they first meet a person.</br>  <br><br>She reminds of another foreign fighter, whose parents were also scientist and suffered from head-problems.</br></br>    <br><br>this is stretching to the stretchiest degree</br></br>  choose your weapon /a/  <br> HER PARENTS ARE DEAD <br><br>I dont remember her parents being scientist at all<br><br> that they where just civvies and where eaten <br><br>atleast alisa chills out after fucking up big time and tries to find bravery some where<br><br><br>Buster blaade</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Great Sword.</br>  <br>Long Blade<br><br><br><br><br><br>Honestly, pretty much as the anime incarnations are improvements but the MC, while I would prefer it isn't Yuu Kanagi, the MC looks generic as fuck outside his shitty eyebrows.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And finally, MC kun<br><br><br>Long Blade yo</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> charge spear </br></br>  <br> Gets an ugly short cape <br> Not the sniper outfit <br>Well this went to shit fast.</br></br></br>  who imouto here  <br>watching for music and her <br>Shiina is love</br></br>  what are the chances MC goes full edge ?  <br>Best imoutos coming thru</br>  I almost feel like UFOTABLE met at a conference room and said:<br><br>"Hey guys, we're under a lot of pressure because everything we've done has been good. Expectations are too high. We need to royally fuck our shit up, how do we do it?"<br><br>And after a sigh of relief, they all decided to do a God Eater anime that would be complete garbage.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>gyo</br></br>  <br><br>I dunno. After all, in the game it's the MC that helps keep the otherwise dysfunctional team together after  Lindow dies </br></br>  <br>she got the normal breast upgrade for anime adaptations.</br>  <br> Lindow dies </br>  <br>I'm almost certain they were commissioned to do it by Bandai, to promote the re-release of God Eater Burst in Japan. <br><br><br><br><br>Why not an onee-san?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> in the anniversary book there's a dark skin version of her </br></br></br>  <br><br> Dark skinned version of Tsubaki <br><br>Don't play games with me anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gyo already managed to do that</br>  should I just accept that   Rage Burst will never make it to the west    who Shio here?    <br><br>http://www.siliconera.com/2015/07/0<wbr>7/god-eater-developer-would-like-to<wbr>-surprise-fans-for-the-series-5th-a<wbr>nniversary/<br><br>I know the chances are low but we can still hope this is it.</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br><br>Shio a best</br></br>  <br>That's probably something for Japan, so I doubt it.<br>Fuck, I'm still mad about the last panel. What's even the point of that panel if they didn't even show the episode anyway?</br></br>  <br>Yeah, it would be a miracle if it did.<br>Time to learn some nippon, I guess.<br><br>At least there's this<br>but i'm not holding out because westerners aren't the main target audience.<br><br><br>Seeing imouto after the thing with Eric is gonna be cool~<br><br><br>There's the thing... Are we gonna have a vanilla GE adaptation or will there be changes to somehow get Burst storyline in?<br>I'm assuming GE anime is advertisement for GER so I assume its plot would be similar. Who knows?<br><br>7 hours 40 minutes to go</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there scans of it or just cell phone pictures?</br>  <br> underboob <br> armpit <br> midriff <br> dem legs <br> white hair + blue eyes <br> Boot ZR+pantyhose <br> loose suspender strap <br> nice hat <br>It's like the designer said "hey, let's see how many goddamn fetishes we can cram into a single design"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's also Russian, does that coiunt?</br>  <br>Of course it does.</br>  <br>Russian characters are always great</br>  blah blah blah  5 hours 30 mins.  <br>For?</br>  <br>Airing.</br>  <br>Oh, GE?</br>  <br>Wait I thought it was delayed an entire month.</br>  <br> believing shitposters <br>mein sides</br></br>  <br>I'm watching this show for Hirao who's a godly director. Also the only director to ever get Satoshi Kon's seal of approval. Otherwise, vidya anime are normally shit.</br>  <br>It's not like Hirao hasn't done shit work before though, remember Gyo? The odds are stacked against him again this time with a shitty source material and troubled production.</br>  Ufotable just change their cover on facebook. <br>/ufotable/photos/np.143669089327785<wbr>5.100009324107137/1159385437420207</wbr></br>  <br>Ufo boobs looks so gropeable, it's almost hypnotic.</br>  This is the show Ufotable had to delay, right?<br><br>Not exactly a promising start.</br></br>  <br>When will newfags learn that the delay was a good thing? I guess they will in a few hours more when GE 1 blows every single unlimited shit works episode out of the water</br>  <br> the first episode exclusive premiere was cancelled because the first episode wasn't even fucking done yet <br> the official TV broadcast was delayed because the first episode still wasn't done yet <br> mfw they have like 11 more episodes to produce each week and the first episode is only just barely finished <br>This is going to be a fucking disaster.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I blame Aniplex for this mess.</br>  <br>Name one well-animated show that had its first episode delayed due to the staff having to touch things up at the last minute.</br>  <br>If you're right, that's boon for everyone. Who doesn't want a good show?<br><br>At the same time though, there's this. <br><br>Ufotable felt comfortable airing the first episode of UBW in four countries around the world. They canceled screening God Eater.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In theaters in four countries, I should mention.</br>  <br> Ufotable felt comfortable airing the first episode of UBW in four countries around the world. <br>Because it had like 3 minutes of actual animation out of 40</br></br>  <br>If you somehow thing UBW's prologue isn't up to snuff, I wouldn't put too much stock in God Eater.</br>  <br>Now imagine how God Eater will be like.</br>  <br>I trust ufo, but delaying the first episode twice cannot be considered a good sign in any way.</br>  <br>It was delayed once, and only one week. Once again, newfags blowing things out of proportion and falling for yaraon yellow journalism.</br>  <br>oh my...</br>  So we won't see GE2 wepons in the anime?  <br>Cancelled premiere + TV delayed for a week.<br><br>Unless they want to do something really spectacular for the first ep, I don't see how this is good, anon.</br></br></br>  <br> 2 hour long episode <br>Surprise Motherfucker!</br></br>  <br> Unless they want to do something really spectacular for the first ep <br>If they wanted to, they would've finished it a while back and not miss the deadline by a week.</br></br>  She only appears in the sequel, right?  <br>Yes.</br>  shit man how many hours left <br><br>yeah</br></br>  <br>3 hours and 3 minutes. Daisuki simulcast is 30 minutes after the airing.</br>  <br>Probably not in the anime. Though GE Resurrection which is coming out soon is being retconning the original story with all the fancy stuff from GE2 Rage Burst.</br>  <br>*3 hours and 23 minutes.</br>  <br> is being retconning <br>Fuck that's not what I meant to say.</br></br>  <br>have they fixed their horrendous video player ? cause if not then guess I will just go with their youtube channel</br>  <br>I how the clothes look like now but her face scares me</br>  <br>cuz ur a fag</br>  <br> Daisuki <br>Eh? Are their subs any good? Video quality?</br></br>  <br>Worst than Funi. 500mb+ for 720p</br>  <br>The subs quality differs between acceptable and really bad.<br><br><br>Implying bigger file size automatically means worse.</br></br></br></br>  Why is /a/ so obsessed over wanting GE to be failure?  <br>If Ufo didn't delayed it in the first place it wouldn't be like this. I blame aniplex.</br>  <br>/a/ likes schadenfreude and the delay raised expectations for a potential train wreck.</br>  <br> Delay <br> MHfags who hate anything about killing monsters that's better than their shit (It's not difficult to be better than MH, though. MH is utter shit) <br>Basically this</br></br></br>  <br>People enjoy seeing things be horrible. Some want to chase the same effect Geass Sundays had. Others are just bitter MH fans who are butthurt their game didn't get an anime(We all know they'd bitch it isn't funded with all of Japan's money and that it isn't completely flawlessly animated from beginning to end)<br><br>Then there are the people who just hate Ufotable and "ufotable fans".</br></br></br>  Still two hours to go?  <br>1 hour and 22 minutes.</br>  30mins til broadcast. Do we have a stream?  horriblesubs release when  <br>Probably up to a few hours after Daisuki simulcast considering it seems they still haven't found a way to do automatic ripping from Daisuki.</br>  Where is it streamed?  <br>Read the thread.</br>  stream pls lads  <br>TV tokyo?</br>  No futakuro live thread?   9minutes <br> not a single fuking stream link </br>  <br>I know that feel</br>  Some kind anon, pls post it and then delete the message.  http://board.futakuro.com/jk2/res/1<wbr>752553.htm<br><br>Live pics here lads</br></br></wbr>  Kita!!  jesus Takayuki Hirao loves his monochrom filter  Is this entirely CG?  <br><br>only certain backgrounds and aragami</br></br>    The style looks weird, but not unwatchable.  <br>Jesus that looks weird.</br>  Well this looks like shit.  <br>Yes, this is what I'm talking about.<br>Feels like Arpeggio.</br></br>  well mc isn't a pure edgelord so thats good    <br><br>What the fuck is up with the coloring on the characters? </br></br>   Tit view <br><br>Nicu.</br></br>  <br><br>Takayuki Hirao likes it</br></br>  any streaming links?  <br>Holy fuck it is terrible.

Bad adaptations of games are not uncommon.</br>  <br>So it's visually shit? <br>I'm guessing there's no real plot?</br></br>  <br>Not too bad, generic MC with normal shounan plot, nothing special.

And that turned out to be a real masterpiece.</br>  So wait, all of these shots are from the anime and not from the game?<br><br>TOP LEL</br></br>  <br>Yeah, it was so bad that it got two seasons and a movie.</br>  Powered by Unreal Engine 3  <br>That sucks. <br>I thought the PVs looked really nice.</br></br>  <br>Who gives a shit it was trainwreck? Definitely not Sunrise</br>  <br>Sidonia had a decent story for a mech anime but the show itself was choppy and cheap looking.</br>  <br>Yeah.

Fuck.</br>  <br>That chatroom is talking about Prison School first episode rating in nico.</br>  It's out on Daisuki.  <br> It looks like the bulk of it is actually hand drawn with post processing to make it look CGIlike which is what has failed. Look at all the key animators and second key animators on this list  <br>Its merely a hybride animation - all of characters and movement are basic CG, that is basically used as 2nd Key, which are manually post processed and details drawn to/artifacts removed/sprite animation added (like some mimic).<br><br>And this is pretty bad case of it.

Boobs can be easily exposed with that outfit.  <br>They were obviously trying to emulate the look of the game without going CG and making the animation shit and ended up failing to get either the look of the game or the animation looking good.</br>  <br>I don't see any problem with that.</br>  <br>You kidding prison school was rated with 92%?</br>  <br> it`s not CG <br>This is what ufotards actually believe</br></br>  <br>But NobuCon was good.</br>   show went full CG shit because Ufotable lost so many time with that Fate garbage <br> "i-its n-not CG!!!!" </br>  <br>And that's her secret weapon against Aragamis, boob crush.</br>  <br>Are you actually retarded enough to think you could switch a whole method of production within weeks?</br>  <br><br>Doesn't that actually make things worse? If this is CG then it's understandable why it looks like shit.

It's a free service which offers 360p and 480p if you're not logged in. Logging in will give you access to 720p and 1080p (still free). The video might not work if you use an adblocker. It also doesn't work for me when using Ghostery so you might want to try whitelisting.</br></br></br>   DAISUKI 480p <br>Anyone know how to rip their subs?</br>  <br>You need to create an account for 720/1080p access, and you'll also have to ask HorribleSubs how to rip videos.</br>  <br><br><br><br>oh god yes</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think someone else called DLSuki uploaded some Daisuki rip on Nyaa. I wonder how they do it.</br>  <br>I thought they used something like Cantasia?</br>  <br>Just wait for a HS rip.<br>Better yet, wait for real raws.</br></br>  <br> bad part right <br>You mean cheap commercial for manga isn't pleasing your expectation? You really need to damped your needs</br></br>  <br> I wonder how they do it. <br>The same way that HS rips from CR and Funi.</br></br>  <br>No, that wouldn't allow them to download the subtitle file as well. Plus CR videos have their logo overlay and username overlay at the start as well. <br>HS is able to download the raw video and sub file from CR's source.</br></br>  <br>the second fate season was fucking garbage<br><br>honestly ufotable should just disband</br></br></br>  I guess this is fine  <br>seems fine to me</br>  <br> Studio deciding what to do <br>Yeah, just like electricians and doctors.</br></br>  <br>Holy shit, based HS.

Watching /a/ trying to talk about animation is always amusing.<br>I guess anything you don't like is CG.</br>  <br>Is this one of the few times being an animeonly fag could be a good thing?</br>  <br>It's up for them to decide the project they are doing you fucking retard</br>  Ah, guess it's meh, but at least they don't give up the show yet.  <br>this is fake right?</br>    <br>It's funny, some people are now saying stuff like<br> oh, it's not that ubw was bad, ufo is just shit <br> damn, they can't animate for shit <br> Aoki-san was ufo after all... </br></br></br></br>  <br>Kota are you okay?</br>    <br> I guess anything you don't like is CG. <br>It's because some people here were watching without their glasses that's all! No one is dumb enough to think the show was entirely CG. This is all just a meme!  Right? </br></br>  <br>This is pretty fucking bad. Read </br>  <br>They are deciding between a limited set of options though. Its not as if studios go "I would quite like to make an anime of that" and then make it. They will be pitching their plans to make an anime to all the various companies that are wanting to have an anime made of the IPs that the studio is interested in working on. They don't really select jobs as much as pick ones they will be willing to work on and then make pitches and then take what they get.</br>  I am really glad that after all these years that this medium has existed we can still constantly improve on the animation of the past.<br>Every season we have well animated and quality shows that truly show you how far the human imagination can go.<br>Truly, may god bless digital animation and the wonders It can bring!</br></br>  <br>Is that a sword-jetbike? Holy fuck I have a new fetish.</br>  <br> read and believe an unsourced Anonymous post on a taiwanese printer centre bbs </br>  <br> No one is dumb enough to think the show was entirely CG <br>Especially not when you can look at the credits here and see for a fact it wasn't.<br/></br></br>  <br>Agreed, season has been filled with nothing but bad manga adaptions thus far, was praying either this or chu feng would be good.<br><br>Just finished the first episode, I can confirm that it's not CG, the aragami are definitley CG but the characters just have some really weird design at an attempt to emulate the game, and really weird outlines.<br>Voice casting is absolutley perfect.</br></br></br></br>  How did this<br><br>become<br><br><br>T-the studio is trolling right? Real first episode next week?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For what purpose? So that you can use them on a TV raw? You would still have to re-time them for that, if you want to go to all that trouble just grab a 480p one and extract them yourself.</br>  <br>That was the only scene where the quality was bad.</br>  <br>Power of CG.</br>  <br> Aoki-san was ufo after all... <br>FUCKING MIUUUUURAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</br></br>  <br>This seems to be better than most video game adaptations. <br><br>Nips usually hated the 1st episode of most video game adaptations since they confused about the story and this episode is mostly characters introduction.</br></br></br>   there are people who unironically hate good CG hybrid   <br>That is exactly what it looks like most of the time, we rarely see any of the kinds of complex camera movement or complex movements or perspectives that usually characterize CG animation. It looks like a hand drawn animation trying to look like a CG animation most of the time.</br>  My seasonal waifu.  Honestly im glad I can read untranslated VNs now because otherwise I might just have killed myself over how awful anime has become  ufotable can't do 2D  <br>shit taste</br>  <br>Shut the fuck up ape, if you could read untranslated VNs you'd have watched it live and realised that it's actually a contender for best anime s/s 15.</br>  <br><br>What it really comes down to is fanboys have a raging hard on for Fate stuff. Take that away and they have nothing else to do but bitch as normal.

Nobody can really tell or pace a story as a TV series anymore and even the animation quality and flashy visuals which the industry tries to put the most emphasis on now is starting to slip do to bad industry scheduling and animators clearly just starting to tire out or not have enough training in the first place. Better to just follow a good game series or something as at least they might maybe possibly have a proper development schedule and come out well polished.

There is no chance of any development between them, as it would come out of nowhere.  <br>Not when she's getting drilled everyday <br><br><br>He looks VERY 10 to me</br></br></br></br>  <br>The second movie clearly hinted at it, and no it's not just the dub.</br>  <br><br>Misty, Oh Misty!<br><br>How doth I expressed my love for thee?<br><br>Are thou the morning dew,<br>reflecting of the sparkly mew?<br><br>Are thou the wind in the trees,<br>skirting gently around the leaves,<br>in a midsummer's eve?<br><br>Are thou the blood of the earth,<br>blessed in womb, taking mine girth,<br>fully,<br><br>I want to fuck you hard, you whore bully,<br><br>forever yours,<br>thy secret love,<br>my waifu will never know.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Serena will be getting drilled by Clemont or the fat ass once Ash leaves her broken hearted in Kalos.</br>  <br> Ash looks for Tracy <br> Misty gets mentioned <br> Ash is disappointed he missed seeing Tracy again <br><br>Nostalgiafags on suicide watch</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0dJ<wbr>XCNVA_vE</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Ayy care to share that shit you're smoking?</br>  why is Serena so cute?  <br>It's actually a plausible ship.</br>  <br>10/10, true poet</br>  Just issuing a timely reminder that this is the best poke doujin.  <br>I haven't watched pokemon since 3rd gen and I dont see any thing going on with misty and ash when I watched gen 1. I'm glad they gave him a girl this time though</br>  <br>Reality, an anime like pokemon will never get a romantic resolution. simple as that sooner or later Ash will screw up or Serena will realize he is a lost cause when it comes to her affection and will move on. <br><br>Its delirious to believe that they would actually make something out of this ship. It is clearly only otaku bait and bringing in the themes of affection also found in the games.</br></br></br>  <br>But masuda and the execs are into it though, it's almost canon and very popular already there in Japan</br>  <br> this new <br>Already confirmed that the staff are pro-ship.</br></br>  <br> Junichi Masuda <br> Like!RT </br></br>  <br>You think the shipping input is coming from the fanbase like misty x ash. <br><br>Well you are clearly wrong. The fucking staff are into it, even masuda.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Rek rival's shit <br> Get cash <br> Fame <br> Cute girls everywhere <br>This is why I have always wanted to be in the Pokemon world.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why are /vp/ such faggots?</br></br>  <br> image <br>Why are pokegirls so lewd?</br></br>  <br>This too</br>    <br><br>Both Wrong</br></br>  <br>CHECK THOSE DIGITS<br><br><br>YOU FUCKING MISSED IT BY 2</br></br></br></br>  <br>they are just promoting another of their products<br><br><br><br>of course not. but actually believing anything will come from its delirious. I even said the reason why shipping was added in was to bait viewers in. Hell isn't one of the upcoming episodes being promoted with a screenshot of Ash holding Serena? exactly. the producers are trying to get people to watch and they will get you to watch it. kids will buy their merchandise, fans will watch the movie, get the pokemon distributions. at the end of the day pokemon has proven time after time that must continue without an actual resolution. <br><br>So enjoy whatever its on this season's menu because then she will just appear in a desolate episode next series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Ahahahahha so is it canon now?</br></br></br>  Is it thursday yet?  <br>A palindrome number is impressive in itself surely</br>  <br><br>Ash is out, Tracy is the only guy in Kanto who can heal Misty's broken heart</br></br>  <br>it was the best for a very long time, I admit.</br>  <br>Well it's their last gamble after last season, BW failed horribly and put the franchise into a miserable position. If not for XY antics they would've probably gone down now. But I do believe they wont continue the anime a little longer and would follow other anime as well and do a reboot with fresh characters in gen 7. Also anime is approaching 20 years</br>  <br><br>They just want a "battle"</br></br>  <br>It would be hilarious if Serena actually ends up being the Brock after XY, and ends up tagging along for future seasons. <br><br>XY has already shaken up the formula quite a bit (granted most of it was as an apology for BW), so it would be that unexpected for them to change the previous, and I quote "boys need a new piece of eye candy to look at every once in a while", policy.</br></br></br>  <br>She looks so good with that haircut. Never has there been a haircut in anime that looked as good as this</br>  <br> wouldn't <br>Typos, sorry about that. Also, in case anybody is wondering, that quote is apparently from Masamitsu Hidaka, the storyboard artist, and the director up til battle frontier if I recall correctly.</br></br>  <br>Considering they made an effort to change Serena, giving her a different vibe from her game counterpart. Also XY broke many status quos already</br>  <br> Iris being adorable <br><br>Rare. Appreciated but extremely rare.</br></br></br>  <br>Also, looks like no one in /a/ noticed Ash's new hairstyle</br>  <br><br>He had a hairstyle?</br></br>  <br>How so?</br>  <br>Gamefreak are masters of creating innocent looking girls that are entirely acceptable for young kids but giving them lewd edges that makes them fappable as all fuck.</br>  <br>Nah dont listen to that fool, /vp/'s back to its current form now they started leaking about the next game. Before that though /vp/ was on a dryspell with no new games announced and it was horrible.</br>  <br>Why is Viola the best gym leader waifu?</br>  Go back to /vp/ and take your endless shipping threads with you.  <br>Thats not Flannery or Gardenia</br>  <br>Chateau viola best viola<br><br><br>I can't deny this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Those fucking poses.</br>  <br>Just wait until Ash gets a Mega stone in a bracelet or something. I'm looking forward to how dramatic they are going to make his posing when that happens.</br>  <br><br> Armpits <br> Boobs <br>I like where this is going</br></br></br></br>  <br>Obligitory</br>  <br><br> Little girl </br></br>  Monthly Oricon franchise sales for June 2015.

Still was a blast marathoning this its nice seeing normal people in a normal setting, maybe slightly cater to our interest by working in the same media.</br>  Not OP; I originally avoided it because I had dropped all their older shows before. I don't know if watching it all in one sitting affected my thoughts, but it's now in my top 10 favourites.  It's better off to marathon the show in one go.  <br>You should try glasslip, a fine work by PA.</br>  <br>fuckoff</br>  <br>What? It was comfy as shit. Glassblowing and shit.</br>  <br>Thanks anon, but ive already seen that</br>   moeblobs making anime <br>Immersion broken, dropped after ep 1</br>  Well shit, I guess I'll download it now.  Who here bakuman?  Shirobako was amazing. Easily AOTY 2014.  When is the last BD out? I need to rewatch.  <br>Because you're new to /a/?</br>  <br>just in the middle of rewatching shirobako, introduced it to some normalfag friends and they all love it.</br>  <br><br>I was the same. Felt to jaded from Assrip to believe in PA works but Shirobako restored my faith. Their show this season looks great so I hope they continue their streak.</br></br>  This show was simply legendary, and Writer-Chan's side ponytail and glasses is quite possibly the most glorious thing I've ever witnessed.  <br>You're an underage retard from /v/ with shit taste?</br>  <br>Cause you're a shiro-BAKA</br>  It's fine, the threads had too much bullying in them anyways.

It's one of those good shows that is just forgotten. <br><br>All the Bakos are great, but Ema and Aoi the best.</br></br>     mfw S2 never   Because you don't believe in Mizushima killing it every time..  What ever happened to the donut schtick?  Was FUNNY STORY lazy or just stupid?  <br>He had a job to do and he was doing it. His higher ups wanted the author to get that next chapter done and the only way he knew how to get things moving was to cut him off from distractions and leave him to focus until he made a breakthrough.<br><br>Funny Story was essentially doing the same thing that Musani did to the director when he wouldn't finish the storyboards for Exodus. It turned out to be the completely wrong approach and a good editor would have known that, but funny story was a blithering corporate yes-man, so of course he didn't know any better.</br></br></br>  I missed it when it was airing because the title sounded cute and the thumbnails for the OPs of the threads always looked cute. Same reason I missed Pleiades.<br><br>It's not like I hate cute either, it's just that there's so much of it that it becomes part of the background.</br></br>  <br>But episode 1 was just the setup. I was expecting it to suck ass because "cute girls making cute anime" but it turned out so much better than expected.</br>  <br>how can a man's dick be safe from those hips??</br>    I want to live with Diesel san.  I want to make Ema a single mom.  <br><br>Enjoy ep23</br></br>  <br>Because watching stuff while it's airing is dumb. Just wait till it's done and meanwhile watch older stuff.</br>  <br>only normalfags watch this, this shit is boring as fuck, and i really want to slap the mc</br>  <br> not watching it with /a/ </br>  <br>and now he's back to having to fallback on his shitty freelance photographer job because he's easily expendable due to the nature of this job and somebody having to pay for this.</br>  <br> Aoi will never smile at you mischievously </br>  <br><br>Good they know who best of the best girls were</br></br>  <br>what if I have keyframes?</br>  <br>His job was to facilitate communication between Musani and the author, not cut the staff out of every decision and fuck them over at every opportunity. He was supposed to know what needed to be communicated when. Sure the author can't be bothered for every little thing but clearly some back and forth is needed. Funny Story just lied to both parties so he could fuck off to the golf course.</br>  <br>I never doubted her for a second</br>  <br>But if you don't watch it while airing, you don't get to be in threads in progress.<br><br>I imagine /a/ Shirobako threads lost their shit when literally Anno saved Christmas but I wasn't around to see it and archive searching is a piece of shit. I imagine they also had threads where they pretended the Third Aerial Girl's Squad is a real anime but I never was in those either.</br></br></br>  bako and cross ange had some of the best threads I've been in on /a/  <br>You also missed the threads where people thought Hiraoka was Yano's ex and the shitstorm in Twitter that caused the staff to come out and state they never had anything.</br>  <br>Dammit, Cross Ange. I never picked it up because the threads about the first episode were all toxic shitposting about whether the heroine had a rod shoved into her spine or her vagina and just never paid attention again, even when they were going on about WHERE WERE YOU WHEN MAGNETO WAS BORN</br>  <br>You missed out.</br>  <br>All I know is that it was allegedly the closest we've had to Geass R2's balance of stupid and fun in a long time, after Valvrave and Guilty Crown were mostly just stupid and not fun.<br><br>But I still haven't gotten round to it because my backlog is a mile long and the threads are over anyway.</br></br></br>  I love Mii-chan!  <br> No chairs for Diesel  <br> Bullying her because she's the youngest  <br><br>Disgusting</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If Mii was real, you guys can get married in the US now.</br></br>  <br>m8 first episode threads were gold</br>  <br> Not Tatami Galaxy the superior work </br>  <br>He really killed it with Another.</br>  <br> these hips <br> male <br>Bully, stop</br></br></br>  <br>It's still around 8 months until everybody starts considering it a shit</br>    <br>Lord have mercy.</br>  <br>You fucked up.</br>    <br>Has this motherfucker explained how he does these yet</br>  <br>It doesn't look any different</br>  <br>This is acceptable.</br>    <br>Content aware scaling.</br>  <br><br>Thank you very much; now I too, can be cancerous.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127942466 <br>I regret nothing.</br>  <br>Literally who?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127942849 <br>I want to shiro those bakos.</br>  <br>The cutest girl</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127942849 <br>That doujin was hilarious.

This time with ship locking.  SOLOMON, I'VE RETURNED  why is Atago such a shotacon?  <br>Not canon.</br>  <br>Disgusting.</br>  <br>I feel like most of the people on these threads weren't at the 1st Solomon event.</br>  <br>And they're about to get taste of what real pain feels like if they weren't around for AL/MI either.</br>  Event is confirmed for "beginning of the next month".<br><br>So I guess it'll be something like April 4 considering how the last event started on a Tuesday as well?</br></br>  <br>I only managed to get in after the event ended. Didn't have much luck with the lottery.<br><br>I still kick myself for missing out on that torp.</br></br></br>  <br> Event is confirmed for "beginning of the next month". <br>That was confirmed a week ago.</br></br>  As unlikely as it is I hope they do a remix of this for the final boss node<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=uaG<wbr>xytQz2_8</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br>We've known it was starting at the beginning of August since July 1st, all they've confirmed now is that i's in the Solomons Sea again, like Iron Bottom Sound. Not all events start on the same day of the week either, it could be as late as the first Friday or the week after.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying early is the same as beginning <br>Early can be 2nd week as well. Beginning is usually first week. It's an annoying difference.</br></br>   boss is Flagship Re Kai with BB Water Oni and BB Hime escorts <br>Make it happen devs.</br>  <br>Upgraded quints are better, 53cm just look cooler.</br>  Why are they reusing a past event? They are seriously skipping the Marianas or Leyte for this?  <br>You do know upgraded torps don't have extra accuracy, right? Upgraded quints are worse off than 53cms by 1 accuracy point.</br>   Poi   <br>Because it's time to show newfags what real pain is. What better way to do it than to show them what night battles are like?</br>  <br>Except we now have yasen gear.</br>  <br> a remix of a remix <br>Well, now.</br></br>  <br>Thanks devs. Now all that's left is to announce that Re-chan will appear in this event. Will sacrificial DDs also be making a return?</br>  <br>Yes, with voices now.</br>  <br> the enemy now has yasen gear to cancel out yours too <br> all the enemies at night have double attack on top of that </br></br>  Out of interest how much actual money have you anons spent on kancolle?  <br>Yasen equipment isn't going to help you against an army of Ri Kai.</br>  <br>You already have fags using sacrifical DDs on 1-6.</br>  <br>Hey man, gotta do something with those dups from 1-1 sparkling.</br>  <br>Nah, I prefer my BGM to not have voices.<br><br>Also is it just me, or is all the BGM of every single event since Ironbottom Sound unable to match up to Ironbottom Sound's BGM?</br></br></br>  <br>Personally I feel like Yorktown's was up there but other than that I'd agree with you.</br>  <br>I don't know, all the other BGM seem forgettable in comparison.</br>  <br>Oh and before I forget, enemy search lights reduce your double attack chances too, see how you like that.</br>  <br> The non-flagship BB Hime has the searchlight <br> Big hitters just waste their cut-ins on her instead of the flagship <br> Summer E-7 <br>I can feel the PTSD already</br></br></br></br>  Nips response on twitter is great. It ranges from disbilief to wonder if it's Iron Bottom Sound repeat or Second Battle of the Solomon Sea (5-5) to fear of yasen nodes.   gauge regen <br> ship lockout <br> night battle to day battle  <br> boss can run away again <br> high LoS requirement <br> Re Kai pre-boss <br> enemy night battle equipment <br> enemy combined fleet <br>This is all going to be in it and there's nothing you can do about it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Considering how the devs told us to prepare our carriers, I'm guessing it's going to be the latter. The Solomon Campaign was mostly an engagement between destroyers and cruisers, with only two carrier battles.</br>  <br> mfw I was so desperate at E-2 that I sank my Hibiki  <br>Almost 2 months ago and it still haunts me. <br>It was the hardest map for me because RNG hated me.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm ready for Enterprise boss then. Re will probably be there too.</br>  <br>1.5k on resources (mainly fuel) when starting out (yes I was a kuso back then; bought 4x 1k fuel and 1x 500 fuel/500 ammo/200 steel/2 buckets, all 300 each)<br>4k to max repair and construction docks (fun fact: each construction dock can act as 1 ship slot)<br>15k to max shop slots<br>14.7k on 21 rings<br>10.5k on 150 screws<br><br>Total: 45.7k points<br><br>Other than the free 500 points, 35k was bought before the system was streamlined, 20k was bought after the system was streamlined, giving a bonus 200 points. So I spent 45k yen total.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> enemy combined fleet <br>I doubt they'll appear this event.</br></br>  Post poi  <br>Considering how rather disappointing the last events were, I'm not holding my breath when it comes to difficulty.</br>  <br>It's kind of foreboding, knowing you're sending your shipgirls where so many of the first Admirals' shipgirls sank.</br>  <br>Dock space * 11<br>Repair docks * 2<br>Construction dock * 1 (misclick)<br>Rings * 16<br><br>25.2k nippon funbucks, not counting the 500 free points and whatever I bought during 10% bonus periods which I don't remember exactly.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. Post canned meat.</br>  <br>Poi stronk<br>Will be marrying her soon.

People have married shipgirls for less.</br>  <br>Because Tanaka used the anime as an excuse to show off his waifu. Except she never did much besides cause drama, and her final showdown with Wo happened off screen. Also if the Admiral loved her so much, why didn't he pick her as a starter? I liked it better when we thought he sank his first Fubuki.</br>  <br>Shit taste</br>  <br>Atago is a lovely ship who happens to have a hilarious amount of porn</br>  <br> Also if the Admiral loved her so much, why didn't he pick her as a starter?  <br>It may be just me, but I feel like more than a few admirals end up falling for shipgirls they didn't join the game for.</br></br>  <br>Spring and Summer 2013 weren't based on any specific campaign or battle, they were made up. Spring 14 was Wake Island. Fall 14 was Operation Kon. Spring was Indian Ocean Raid.</br>  <br>Well at least I can understand why.</br>  <br>It's not Fubuki's fault, it's the staff's fault.</br>  <br>But he didn't even have her before falling for her.</br>  <br>Maybe Poorfag Admiral had one and he saw her.</br>  <br> Well at least I can understand why. <br><br>It´s the outfits. Atago and Takao have gorgeous outfits.</br></br></br>  <br>The admiral fapped to a lot of Fubuki doujinshis and turned into a lolicon before he realized he loved her</br>  <br> Fubuki <br> loli </br></br>  <br><br>Takao is so sexy. It's a shame she's shit stats-wise.</br></br>  <br> new ttk <br> lots of carriers <br>i smell some bullshit bait flying around these parts!</br></br></br>  <br>Probably CVLs, Houshou included.</br>  <br>BEHOLD BOAT-BAGS!!!

I've been trying a composition of Jun'you, Akagi, Nagato, Mutsu, Atago and Takao, though I'm usually repelled by the zone just before the boss.<br><br>So, it generally takes 3-6 hours between attempts due to repairs. What can I do to up my chances? Just level the ships or keep going?

You don't have a point because you completely misread the post.</br>    <br>Everyone should be kai, use http://aircalc.net/ to make sure you really need four fighters, and I hope that isn't your actual order because carriers should always fill the last slots in your fleet. Then offer a few DDs as sacrifice and RNG should look favorably on you.</br>  <br>gonna spam all night eh?</br>  <br>Do you even understand English?

Never have I wanted to thoroughly ravage a boy so much ever since Jun and Hideyoshi. <br><br>To slam him face first against the wall, getting a good view of his pants tightly hugging that ample ass of his. That delicious apple bum which he flaunts everywhere. I want to fucking fondle it, lick it, smush my face on their soft curves, and finally hotdogging my diamond hard cock between them. God to see him squirm and moan like the little buttslut that he is. Trailing my hands on his barely pubescent feminine, gently twirling around his erect nipples, playfully teasing his tiny nipcock as it twitches and spurts precum all over his underwear.<br><br>Ah fuck. Without lube, totally dry, thrusting it in him as he arches his back to the mix of pain and pleasure coursing through his body. Churning the insides of his tight boypussy like hot butter. Minutes. Hours. Days. Week in and week out, assuming direct dominion over that little demon. Savagely fucking this bundle of concentrated sex.<br><br>Fuck me.<br><br> Oh god save my soul. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to ravage his boypussy and I also want to suck his girly dick. A-Am I turning gay?  <br> turning </br>  <br><br>Calm down, anons.<br> I'm first in line. </br></br></br>  <br>I stopped caring long time ago.</br>  <br>Yes. He's such a tease.<br>He needs a good dicking to be put in his place.</br></br>  <br>Guilty as charged.</br>    Stop fantasizing. All traps will someday grow into old men.  <br>Uh. So?<br>Can't fuck, or at least fantasizing about fucking, a hot person/character now because they will one day grow old?<br>Kind of retarded logic is that?</br></br></br>  <br>Not just one, but several of them.</br>  <br>Is a fool who would forsake the present for suffering in the future</br>  <br>It's okay because Kobayashi wants to get ravaged, but if you don't do it hard enough he'll get bored</br>  <br>So what? You just have to search a new young one.</br>   In the original series Kobayashi is an idealized boy character. He is smart, resourceful, fearless, dashing, beautiful, the type of child every grandma would adore. Since he is so young he can also impersonate female characters. He is the original "pretty boy". He is also devoted to Akechi. While in the series this devotion is innocent, he is so pure that the idea of soiling him is almost automatic. And ever since the publication of these novels, people have been all too willing to do this (so much that Kobayashi is often considered the source of the shotakon stereotype (look this up on Wikipedia)). <br> The temptation to corrupt Kobayashi is twofold. First, have you ever read a "children's book" and thought "no boy would every act this way?" This was the beauty of Tom Sawyer, he was the rare boy that acted like a boy (and this is why Twain wrote him that way). Most of the other boy's stories had characters who would listen to their mother, say their prayers at night, pull the chair out for a girl (to properly sit her, not to watch her smack her ass), would never get into a fight, and would never, ever dip a girls red pigtail into an inkwell (anne of green gables reference). <br> Get it now? That is exactly how Kobayashi was portrayed in the novels. He was idealized boy that every mother (and they were the one's buying the books at the time) dreams of having, i.e. he is a daughter. </br></br>  /a/ - Heterosexuality &amp; Effeminate Boys    I want to run my fingers all over his naked body. I want to feel the shape of his skull with my fingers, then go lower across the nape of his neck and count his vertebrae and ribcage.  <br>Boys really are the best girls.</br>   tfw no porn <br>I thought the elevens would be all over this shit</br>  Traps are a conspiracy to lower Japan's birthrates even more.  <br>I hated how lightly they took the whole chair thing. The only person who was actually freaked out about it was the new teacher everyone else was super normal with it. Also the confession scene was horrible. <br>  Examiner best girl  </br></br>  <br>I'm fine with this.</br>  <br><br>Traps are byproduct of Japan's boyfucking tradition.</br></br>  <br>Truly a blessing.</br>  I've never wanted to fuck a boy so much.
