[ Humanity Hasn't Only Declined, so has anime.  Someone wasn't here when it was airing.    <br> when it was airing. <br>And nowadays, do people care?<br><br>I rest my fucking case.</br></br></br></br>  Karek-ano  Once it was done airing and the "THE FUCK DID I JUST WATCH?" dust settled, it was never spoken of again.  Jintai thread?  <br>I liked it because it was unconventional and I'm a sucker for any post-apocalyptic stories. I didn't like the manga arc, but it other than those episodes, I thought it presented a lot of interesting ideas.</br>  Keit-ai.  <br>It's one of my favorite anime.<br><br>I love Himari :3</br></br></br>  <br>When an anime ends and there is no source material (or other) translations, there is nothing to talk about, so obviously not many threads are made (excepting the older series with huge fanbases like NGE).<br><br>Jinrui still gets the rare thread here and there, but there isn't much to say.</br></br></br>  First few chapters were amazing but then it was reduced to typical shounen.<br><br>Regardless, /a/'s never spoken about it.</br></br>  <br> Humanity Hasn't Only Declined, so has anime. <br><br>Spic-kun, please.</br></br></br>  Only ever mentioned in OPT for this one page.

I almost can't believe there's still no one translating Haru no Sakana. I pitched it to a few scanlation groups years ago when it got its first tanokbon.

Do they have enough content?  <br>They can pad it out with some of the side chapters from 3rei.</br>  <br>If they make a cliffhanger end  and announce 3rei , yes<br><br>they used 16 of 27 manga chapter in the first part, they need to use Side chapters of zwei and drei (like Rin remember kid Shiro) and add more fanservice/extra Scenes (Like Luvia Butler v/s Bazet )</br></br></br>  <br> bigger bust than Leys <br><br>Oy vey<br><br> Why the fuck are Luvia's measurements still unknown </br></br></br></br></br>  Will we get this chapter?  I'm surprised you guys are so sure that SL would do 3rei. It's obvious that they enjoy animate the cute lolis / fanservice part of Prisma the most while battle is just side dish, 3rei is the opposite with pretty much non-step action so I doubt they even have the budget for it to not look like shit.  Why are all the best Type-moon not written by Nasu?  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if they went with an anime original ending to the series. Beyond what you said, 3rei is a big investment. It's as long as 2wei at this point and it keeps on going, so that's two whole seasons to factor in.</br>  <br>When is Gil going to appear? mid-seasonish? I don't follow the manga beyond spoiler pages in Fate threads but I've heard good things about the Gil alter (?) fight.</br>  <br>Endou Aya if they keep the old VA.</br>  <br>I'm waiting for them to exploit Kuro's underlying pranalust for Gil</br>  <br>They can make a original ending for zwei and if they make drei they can make a original start episode (like they need to check the zone where Illya fight gil)</br>  <br>I hope you're not talking about Prisma here. Other than fanservice for TM audience and pedophiles, this series has nothing else to offer. Flat characters, failed attempt at serious plot in 3rei, aweful humor.</br>  <br>He's the final boss of 2wei<br><br>Then he becomes a protagonist in 3rei and eventually peaces out because the writers didn't know what to do with him anymore</br></br></br>  <br> The first to tip a fedora </br>  <br>Aside from the beach shenanigans, the rest of 2wei is fighting against Gil, there's a couple of good fights, especially the one involving Bazett.<br>The fight people usually talk about is one of Ko-Gil vs an homunculus using his card in 3rei.</br></br>  <br>That is a good option, we won't be left with a cliffhanger and they can still start 3rei later if they feel like it. I prefer them to gather enough budget before touching 3rei at all.<br><br>However if they didn't go to the alternative world right after the fight then what would to Gil and his card?</br></br></br>  <br>He's been way for like one chapter, just give it time, I'm sure him and Kotomine are up to something.</br>  <br>I feel like they're going to make KoGil show up for more than he did in the manga, in terms of not being his Alter form and talking to Illya and the crew. I feel like they'll add a few scenes for him.</br>  <br>It's so weird that he just left like that. At the start I thought him and Kirei were scheming something together for sure but nothing came out of it. Part 3 sure have lots of anti-climax situations.</br>  <br><br><br>Man Ilya a cute</br></br></br>  <br>The first priority right now is info dumping, we really don't know a lot about what the fuck happened in that last fight. Then I'm sure some Gil and Kirei shenanigans will happen.</br>  <br> info dumping <br>I was really expecting this, but when I was rereading the manga I realize there's really not much to tell, Miyu has already given quite a lot of information during the 3 series.  Miyu's Kiritsugu is dead, for example. </br></br>  <br>Still better than drei. Shit goes more over the edge forgetting about sol parts and fanservice. I got into this for lolis not this holy grail bullshit again.</br>    Next chapter when?  <br> Flat characters, <br><br>You mean delicious flat characters.</br></br></br>  <br>26th.</br>  <br>That's an impressively-sized black knight greatsword.</br>  this and carnival phantasm are the only good things to come from the TM franchise  <br>Or they can just adapt as is since 3rei has a potential for more character goods.</br>  <br>Why does Miyu looks so serious there? She's surrounded by Illyas in slutty clothes, that's like her heaven.</br>  So well get<br><br> Episode 1: Beach Party <br> Episode 2: Attack on MudGil, end with him breaking free <br> Episode 3: Attack on MudGil pt2, with ZweiForm Illya <br> Episode 4: Drawback into the parallelworld <br><br>?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>        <br> Miyu's puffy vulva outline  <br>Lewd</br></br>  <br>Miyu is without a doubt the lewdest Prisma.</br>  FUNI a shit<br><br>Continued from </br></br>  <br><br>Oh alright, thanks niggas, if it means we're getting a better quality release, I can wait 2 days.</br></br>  <br>I honestly was hoping for some more monstergirls.

I hope you don't mind it.</br>  <br>When I read the parts with him all I could imagine was the liches from HoMM3.<br><br>Those undead armies were OP as fuck.</br></br></br>  A question for anyone who has reads the LNs of other anime series they've watched. What is the pacing like in other series. Example, the first episode of the Overlord seems to over the first two chapters of the LN. Is two chapters per episode a normal pacing?  <br>the ride never ends the anime</br>  <br>Vampire loli of the year.</br>  <br>No it's decidedly slow pacing, but I feel the first ep set us up well, things will likely pick up from here on.</br>  <br>More or less, the pacing is "well done" when you get at least 3 eps per volume. If it's 1-2, you know they had to either cut out huge amounts of filler or actual good content.<br><br>1st ep of Overlord took it slow and kept it faithful, the only thing amiss was the dorky heroes intro (might have spent that time to the Aura &amp; Shalltear moaning) and that they cut out Ainz's paranoia of his safety and his tests of low tier spells prior to Arena the Solomon's Gate and the Lemegeton's Demon.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I ask because given that each volme is 4-5 chapters long, even at 2 chapter per episode it seems like they'll end somewhere between the fifth and sixth volumes in just a single 13 episode season.</br></br>  <br>and his tests of low tier spells prior to Primal Fire Elemental and before the Arena, his tests in the Solomon's Gate.<br><br>Depending on 2nd episode, we can either judge if they're aiming at 4+4+4+1 for 3 volumes or 3+3+3+3+1 for 4 volumes.<br><br>If I'd go with 444 they'd probably end the next eps at start of Carne onslaught, end with Portal. Next one ending with Gazef's arrival and 4th on the epilogue/throne room.<br><br>3333 would have to condense the shit between carne start and nigan quite a bit to fit in there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Rororo ;__;  <br>The first volume will most likely get 4 episodes, and the rest too if the pace stays the same.</br>  <br>I'd roll with 4441 just because the ending and epilogue of 3rd volume is so much better ending point for a single season than the quite sore thumb 4th volume's end that doesn't rrreally bridge into the "Grand Plan Nazarick" nor future events.</br>  I want off of Papa Bones' Wild Ride!  Suggestions on whether I should trim the beginning or end?  <br>I want on Papa Bones' Wild Ride!</br>  <br>Trim both for a single animated loop.</br>  <br><br><br>Thanks for answering, this is the first series I've read the LN for, so I didn't know much about how the pacing was going to work.</br></br></br>  <br>Same way it's easier for me to do bdrips in the long run if the someone gives in effort to the original tv work to be better than cr/funi/hadena tier shit. Hopefully the bdmv's get uploaded that is.</br>  <br>Expired goods shouldn't be looking down on anyone, don't you have a dakimakura you should be molesting Albedo?</br>  I don't like any of these characters except for Ainz. Albedo is only good when she's in Deredere mode, otherwise she's an insufferable cunt who interrupts with 'muh respekt' whenever she likes. Shalltear is shalltear, about the only character I like is sebas and that blonde slime cutie. Nerbler is just albedo without the dere.  <br>The undead are even more broken in 6.<br>They're racial ability is that they can revive the dead, so you can go into battle against huge numbers of opponents and come out of the battle without losing a single unit.</br></br>  <br>Too bad for you. I like them all for their + and - because they were created like that, even more so after Ainz confirmed they can change.</br>  <br>Testing this again.</br>  <br>Huh. I was wrong. Maybe a few fractions of a second at the end so you can look at her tits more before it goes back to her face?</br>  Has anyone else started working on converting OL into a ttrpg  <br>How about now?</br>  <br>Oh crap, now its too long. The hell happened there.</br>  <br>No, but it sounds like fun.<br> But I have nobody with which to play it, anyway. ;_; </br></br>  <br>That's what I was thinking, but just a bit shorter, yeah.</br>  <br>ts going to take me a while to create a mapped replica, because I'm relying on images from the anime and manga, as well as the written descriptions from the LN. So I'll need to wait a few more episode before I can work on the maps for any thing aside from floor ten. Tonight I'll probably start kick around ideas on how I should stat Nazarick crew.</br>  Fingers crossed.  <br>How would the setting work? Would players start as a minion in Nazerick, or a lizardman subject, or invaders of the tomb or something along those lines?</br>  <br>Looking good.</br>  Props to the anime for having OP lyrics that matches the content of the show and not some vague bullshit like it always does.  Am I the only one shocked by the mostly positive reception of this? I thought for sure most people would write it off as another SAO clone without even watching.  <br>Because most people read its LN.</br>  <br>Skeletor is the goddmned MC, of course people are gonna give it a watch.</br>  <br>I thought it would be some generic shit too but I'm glad I watched the first episode. Now after I consumed to much I have to wait for the rest of the volumes to be released.</br>  <br>I'd classify it as "under-the-radar" good. I don't think many people are watching it, but those that are like it.</br>  <br>The MC is skeletor and everyone is clichee evil characters. Way harder to make SAO comparisons.<br><br>also the premise is more interesting than SAO´s.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm talking about the blatant animeonlyfags who say they liked the first episode and are interested in finding out where the series goes.</br>  Best girl.  <br>When you have a spooky skeleton as an MC its way easier to retain an audience.</br>  So Pandora's Actor was shown in the OP.<br><br>He's hidden behind the credits at the very end.</br></br>  <br>Good find.</br>  <br>Is the LN that good? I haven't bothered to read it (busy working on Qualidea at the moment), but I figured it'd be another half-decent SAO clone</br>  So funi is the only shit we are going by? Nothing else?  <br>Pity he won't show up in the show itself.</br>  <br>I'd say it's better than your average shit LN.</br>  <br> SAO clone <br>It's pretty pathetic that everything is being compared to SAO, like it's some industry standard or something.</br></br>  <br>It's not a masterpiece but it's well written for a LN (even if the translation isn't really the best thing since sliced bread). The characters are interesting, the story is entertaining and there's enough mystery about what the hell is going to happen next in Papa Bone's story for you want to read more.</br>  <br>It is written like an actual novel, instead of that one-to-two-sentences-per-paragraph you tend to see in most LNs. The author takes effort to actually describe things and builds suspense quite well. He foreshadows well, too.</br>  <br>They could probably fit him in as an extra non-canon scene. Something like Ainz going around and inspecting every room just to check how things are and running into PA, shenanigans ensue.</br>  <br>I just started piecing together ideas a few hours ago, so much of this is rough notes. I'm looking at starting the setting shortly before Nazarick suddenly pops up in the new world. So initially Nazarick doesn't exist. When Nazarik does pop into existence, the players may start as explorers discovering a new location. Then I'm hoping to transition them to a more diplomatic role, however given the fickleness of some players it may turn out differently.</br>  <br>Wait, why? Pandora's Actor has a major scene in Volume 3.</br>  <br>Then he should have been featured more prominently in the OP or ending. It'll probably be a pretty short scene. It's just talking after all.</br>  <br>I was thinking that the reason he wasn't featured is because he is a mysterious character up until he gets revealed in the third volume.</br>  Pic related show "種族：異系種" translatable by something like "Race: Exogamous/Outbreeder" but later on Ainz says that only heteromorphic people (異形種) can join his guild.<br>How should I translate it? Does the show goofed up?</br>  <br>I'm so sleepy that I forgot to put the picture.</br>  <br>leaving it at heteromorphic should be fine</br>   The Supreme Overlord of Nazarick Ainz Ooal Gown will never use you as a chair <br>Why even live? ;_;</br>  <br><br> SAO clone <br>Every threads. i wonder if it will be the same if Overlord came out before SAO</br></br></br>  <br>Many people haven't watched it because its not on CR<br> lel </br></br>  Could Shiroe beat the Great Tomb of Nazarick if he had the entire town of Akibahara at his disposal?  <br>I doubt it.<br>Also, SAO is the Nurutu of the LN, that's why people like to compare shows.</br></br>  <br> Considering every Adventurer is possibly as strong or stronger than a floor guardian, yes.<br> What I would like to know if who would win if Ainz and Shiroe clashed. Each one can bring 3 people with them.</br></br>  Why Albedo is such a slut  <br> succubus <br>Damn, why can't I figure this out?</br></br>  <br>Without some type of resurrection magic most people couldn't hope to compete against Ainz.</br>  <br>Yes, SAO would of been popular either way, and i heard people calling Hack a SAO clone.</br>  <br> Each one can bring 3 people with them. <br>That puts it in Ainz-favor. In a party v party, I think Shiroe would have the advantage.</br></br>  <br> every Adventurer is possibly as strong or stronger than a floor guardian <br><br>lol</br></br></br>  <br> Considering every Adventurer is possibly as strong or stronger than a floor guardian, yes. <br>The hell? Where did you get that from?</br></br>  <br>What if they equip null death?</br>  <br> and i heard people calling Hack a SAO clone. <br>How is even possible?</br></br>  <br>Well Ainz most powerful skill bypasses immunities and resistances and kills even invalid targets such as air. But I suppose all you really need to do I know before hand what it does and teleport the hell away.</br>  <br> Considering every Adventurer is possibly as strong or stronger than a floor guardian, yes. <br><br>That's not true. They go over the exact numbers in the LN..there are about 120 Platinum heroes in the entire empire, and they aren't even on the level of the maids, or barely can match them. The only humans who could probably win in a straight fight would be a yggdrasil player or someone like gaelz with a shit ton of legendary equips</br></br></br>  Just another thread to discuss the suffering of cute girls.   Wake me up   <br>Yeah, I feel like it was the same kind of scenario as Radio, except she didn't make it. <br><br>Although, didn't they have medicine and everything else to protect against all of that?<br><br><br>You're right, but in the end, we might not know until twenty chapters or more are released. I just feel like it was because she was supposed to be marked as different from the rest of them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The SoL bait lasted way too much. It was good anyway, but the characters look wierd.<br>I wonder if they'll change the OP</br>  Replying for shovel.    Rii-chan, Miki, Kurumi... even Taroumaru! They're all okay! <br><br>Everything's gonna be daijobu!</br></br>  How dead is she?  <br> ;~; </br>  Had no idea what I was getting into with this, just thought it was SoL comfy stuff. Jesus I've never WUT'd so hard as I did at the end of the episode.  <br>Currently only half dead.</br>  I remember there was a chapter that showed Megu when she first became zombiefied and blamed herself but I can't remember why she was alone in a dangerous area in the first place.  <br>Half.</br>  <br>100% confirmed to be alive. Just look at the ending.</br>  <br>Dead enough.</br>  That smile. Made me fall in love all over again.  <br>Right as she started turning she remembered the safe house and tried to get there. But didn't make it.</br>  <br><br>How much longer does she have? Will she make it until the end?</br></br>  why is yuki's subconscious so useful  <br><br>Japanese raws where? I don't want Korean shit.</br></br>  ONE FUCKING JOB.<br><br>FUCKING<br><br>JOB</br></br></br></br>  <br>No where, they haven't been uploaded online yet.</br>  <br>I hope they keep the OP almost exactly how it is, but slowly add more "grusome" stuff i the background</br>  <br>Unclear, but she's dead enough that zombies don't notice her unless she tries to get their attention.</br>  <br>Yeah that's in the same chapter but is it ever said why she went into zombie territory and got bit in the first place.</br>  <br>Best girl</br>  <br><br>And yet Korean ones have. This is totally bullshit, I wish I could buy an ebook of the magazine or something.</br></br>  Healing.  <br> Akarin is invincible because the zombies don't even realize that she's there  <br>The savior of humanity right here.</br></br>  <br>why? shovel chiyo is good enough</br>  <br><br>I thought they didn't notice her because it was night.</br></br>  <br> bait <br>It's a SoL series. Get used to it.</br></br>  <br>Highly unlikely and the time left is completely unknown. This waiting for her to die is the biggest suffering possible.<br><br><br>They never said, but in the scene where she got bitten there were a shit ton of zombies.<br>So im guessing the zombies broke through the barricade.<br><br><br>Its extremely bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   they had to kill the fuking dog?  <br><br>seriously?!</br></br>  <br>They're all dead  on the inside. </br>   anime was good. <br><br> translations will continue once i obtain scans, survive comiket, and get back from japan on the 18th next month. <br><br> apologies for the delay. <br><br>Only two more months people, hang in there.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The dog was doomed from the beginning. <br><br><br>You're definitely not wrong, anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But Kurumi isn't an Ayayayaya. She's a het girl who wanted a boy and even though she's manly as fuck and would be a great husbando for any of the girls, she still wants to be a cute bride. <br><br><br>Shovel Chiyo a best.</br></br></br></br>  This show achieves everything that SoRaNoWoTo failed to-- enjoy it faggots, here's the actual SOL with a real backstory and not just bullshit pretending to go somewhere.<br><br>This is about as good as slice of life gets.</br></br>  <br> dog <br>He will forever be nothing but a useless side character.<br>I refuse to accept him.</br></br></br>  <br> But Kurumi isn't an Ayayayaya. She's a het girl who wanted a boy and even though she's manly as fuck and would be a great husbando for any of the girls, she still wants to be a cute bride. <br>This changes nothing.</br></br>    <br>It changes EVERYTHING.</br>  <br>CHANGES. NOTHING.<br><br>show could have been great, now it will never surpass mediocrity.</br></br></br>  So wait, is the dog real or not?<br>Was "the dog is on the loose" just an excuse her friends used to get ptsd-chan to run for her life?</br>  <br>The dogs real, he's just going to be emotional bait.</br>  <br>Dog seems real. There's nothing to run for their lives from on that floor of the school.</br>  Who makes the best faces?  <br>Nah, now it'll be a masterpiece. Take your Ayayayayaya and get outta here.</br>  Is the manga still being translated<br><br>shit seems slow or stalled</br></br>  <br>Rii when she breaks for sure.</br>  <br>I sound like a fucking idiot, but did the chalkboard really say that? How did I miss that? Fuck, man.</br>  <br> https://rkeg.wordpress.com/2015/07<wbr>/09/re-gakkou-gurashi/</wbr> </br>  <br>Cray or Shovel definitely.</br>  <br>it's okay anon, you were probably just enjoying the SoL antics</br>  <br>thanks maangyne</br>  Worst fanbase on /a/ already  <br><br><br>They all make good faces when they're freaking out.</br></br></br>  Tomodachi deshou~  Damn, I like the premise of this show, but I can already tell it's one I'm not going to be able to watch with /a/ because of spoils from mangafags.<br>Oh well, see you guys next season~</br>  <br>Her head covers that half of the chalkboard until the very last moment. When she moves and reveals that line, the shot immediately changes.<br><br>It's foreshadowing on the level of an american horror flick.</br></br></br>  <br>The dog was real before Mii-kun was real.</br>  <br>Why didn't Kurumi share the medicine with radio-chan?<br>Did nobody ever tell her what happened to her?</br></br>  <br>Why don't you just read the manga and stop being a secondary then?</br>   Thinking everything about the school seems suspicious as fug while watching the first episode <br> That reveal at the end <br>I don't really like Moe, but t may have been worth it for that reveal at the end.</br></br>  <br>Yeah it's not really that important anyway. I could imagine it never getting mentioned too, especially if it's something inconsequential like a seasonal change or a different department.</br>  <br>Radio had already fully turned. It's a suppressant not a cure.</br>  Every time I watch a Zombie show, this idea crosses my mind.<br><br>It would be so much easier to just kill yourself and be done with it, instead of living in horror everyday in fear of being eaten alive.<br>All resistance is futile when you're outnumbered 10000 to 1.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah this. i watched the episode and right after read the manga. it doesn't take long and it's worth it</br>     this will be done in Chino's voice   <br>Because then I'll know what happens in the anime before getting to see it. That doesn't seem ideal</br>  <br>I like how the microscope was used to bash someone's head in.</br>  what is the point of her hat? is it some coping device or is it meaningless?  Just like Highschool of the dead there's only one way this story can end. Death, the sweet release of death as the world goes to shit Just like Dead Rising, just like Resident Evil, just like Left for Dead, just like The Last of us. There's no such zombie story where suddenly the zombies are defeated and humanity rebuilds to what it once was.  <br>The anime will never be able to do the suffering as good as the manga anon, trust me.</br>  <br> he doesn't like hats </br>  <br>Well I know who I don't want in my SoL apocalypse survivor group.</br>  <br>There's that word again.<br>Can we not start this shit please?</br></br>  <br><br>I never really get why people complain about spoilers. Why can't people just enjoy the ride? A good story is entertaining even if you go through it two or three times.</br></br>  <br>How can they be so carefree when straggler zombies occasionally get through the barricade?</br>  <br>Yeah, it'd be depressing as fug to live in a zombie world. <br><br>I mean, sure, you could live, but you'd be looking over your back for the rest of your life.<br><br><br>I'm assuming that the cast will slowly dwindle as more and more characters die to zombies or crap, probably with a death directly caused by one of them as a zombie.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Individual zombies aren't hard to deal with. Just bash their heads in with a baseball bat.</br></br>  What would you do?  <br>It's still better if you don't know what's coming. I still like to rewatch stuff, a lot actually, but being surprised, in real time, by the work itself is undeniably better than hearing about it from someone else before actually seeing it.</br>  <br>let her bite me so we could live happily ever after together</br>  <br>Everything's easier if you kill yourself, anon. The struggle is what makes things worthwhile. <br><br>It's pretty difficult to live in a zombie apocalypse, and you have a good chance to die every day, but I'd rather die fighting zombies than just giving up and never even attempt survival.</br></br></br>  <br>Cure her, make her fall for me then marry her.</br>  <br>They don't occasionally get through. That happens right after a fire and a lot of their barriers were down.</br>  <br>Why don't you just stop trying to act like you feel superior and force other peple to read the manga? You're only ruining the threads with your idiotic attitude faggot.</br>  <br>There is a pink haired girl with brain damage running all around on the floors, and you are expected to follow her whims around. She even goes to the toilet at night. It's not a matter of difficulty of dealing with a single one.</br>  <br>So do they have some kind of endgame? Leaving the school? Finding other survivors? Or is this one of those things where somehow there are no other survivors?</br>  <br>Do you go to the toilet at night, anon?</br>  <br>Blame chink and gook scanlators for being stingy little shits and not making their raws public.</br>  <br>They do leave the school like one or two chapters after this </br>  <br>She will give you zombie STD.</br>  <br>But this is not what Sora no Woto tried.</br>  <br>It's a simple case of risk and return.<br>It's just not worth it when there is no light at the end of the tunnel.</br></br>  <br>Maybe it's different for everyone.  I typically get immersed into something to the point where I just forget everything else the first time through. </br>  <br>this sounds a little bit too familiar</br>  <br><br>Tell her that the toilets are going through indefinite maintenance and have her piss in a bucket. As for bashing the zombies in, tell her that's a new trendy way to greet people.</br></br>  <br> I'm assuming that the cast will slowly dwindle as more and more characters die to zombies or crap, probably with a death directly caused by one of them as a zombie. <br><br>Obviously. No way in hell will the author actually let them survive this. Nobody survives in zombie shows or movies. Even when they fool you into thinking they could, BAM, suddenly the save house they reached is gone because some dick head hid the fact they were bitten or the stupid corporation decided to keep making their zombie juice OR, and this is my personal favorite, a crazy fucker unleashes an experimental zombie in the safe house because "Fuck the world, fuck surviving, let's all meet again in the next life!". There was even a zombie movie that had it's group escape to the Flordia Keys and low and behold, there are zombies there too and they all die.</br></br></br>   All these people who haven't read the manga <br>Seriously? I finished it in a few hours, its not long.</br>  <br>Is the brain damage a permanent thing?</br>  <br> brain damage <br>Its all an act, she knows full well whats going on.<br><br><br>And you think you're any better than him by posting this? replying is going to cause as much shitposting as he is.<br><br><br>It'll all be worth it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is the light at the end of the regular life tunnel?<br><br>I'm seriously asking, I just don't know.</br></br></br>  <br>No. She's only pretending to be retarded.</br>  <br>It's okay, she needs no explanation of what's going on.</br>  <br>You're ruining them by crying about how people are discussing the series in a thread about it. Fuck off. He obviously is superior since he actually follows the material instead of just coming to 4chan to blindly shitpost like you do.</br>  <br>Wasn't that Dawn of the dead or something?<br>I try not to waste time watching Zombie stuff, because it's all really similar. I mean, seriously.</br></br>  <br> pick up an anime <br> clear starting point <br> clear ending point <br> left satisfied and able to move on after the season ends <br><br> pick up a manga <br> read for 2 years <br> gets delayed for 1 year <br> author starts making chapters again for 3 more years <br> author delays for 2 years <br> picks back up for another 5 years <br> sales go down so author is forced to conclude the story <br> you actually died 4 years ago and never got to finish reading </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Its all an act, she knows full well whats going on. <br><br>Then why does she still go to the bathroom at night? That's so dangerous, she should at least do the favor of pissing in the bucket.</br></br></br>  <br>i'm pretty sure that's fire damage. What kind of idiot would use the lens area for bludgeoning instead of the base? Lenses are a bitch to replace</br>  <br>Because it's not really dangerous. Their barricades are strong and almost the whole school building is clear. Even if she does run into one she'd snap out of pretending to be retarded and deal with it like she did the one time it happens in the classroom.</br>  <br>Fuck her as she is turning</br>  <br><br>Not really. <br><br>The thing is that shows and movies and a lot of other zombie media don't really show you what actually happens to human bodies when left in the sun/cold for prolonged periods of time. Basically, their bodies would collapse within a few months tops. No matter what kind of cool stuff is helping their tissues out... sunlight is not good for your skin. Being out in the elements will destroy your body.<br><br>Shelter actually comes before water on the list of needs for survival. You will certainly die of the elements before you have time to dehydrate.<br><br>In short, the integrity of zombie bodies cannot hold. Even if we assume they can somehow move past death, just the stuff that a body is made of is going to severely degrade and collapse.<br><br>Plus, there's just too many people who actually do have zombie survival plans and supplies. While I didn't invest a lot of time into it, I do have them. Worst case, just chill.<br><br>Something missing from most zombie fiction is great and competent leaders. They do exist, please trust that I am one of them and would work to get things in order. Guys like Rick/etc have leadership thrust upon them and aren't really ready for the weight and haven't done prior planning.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> author delays for 2 years <br>This isn't HxH anon, it isn't going to happen.<br>Just read the manga.<br><br><br>Because she's still an idiot. And the school is barricaded so its not really too dangerous.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Will there be a full flashback of events when the school went down the shithole?  <br> deal with it like she did the one time it happens in the classroom. <br><br>But she's usually unarmed. That time she was lucky she had a broom.</br></br></br>  <br>Running from a single zombie isn't hard.</br>  <br>Feeling comfy with your life and smiling before dying.</br>  <br>They mentioned she was broken for days, but suddenly got up and she was got more genki than ever before. I just wonder how broken inside is she, that she can put this act up every day.</br>  <br>But your waifu accepted him. She even fed him with the taste of survival. Would you really utter such cold words to her if she had to mercy kill him in the anime?</br>  <br>Only one, and it shows why they survived.<br>And a little something else.</br></br>   DIE <br>SUKI~</br>  <br>Your theory doesn't work in Resident Evil universe  shittiest zombie franchise imo </br>  I think Gakkou Gurashi could make a good VN or adventure game. With all the possible ways to die/lose.<br><br> Having to escape/kill a zombie or be killed <br><br> Try to immediately approach the helicopter instead of proceeding cautiously, get literally blown the fuck out <br><br> That chapter where Miki must find the serum for the infection, if you take too long in getting the serum and coming back,   Yuuri will have killed Kurumi when you return <br><br>Stuff like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Yet The Walking Dead is a very popular show despite the fact that we all know how it ends. All of them dead or if the author wants to be an asshole, it ends on a scene with whoever huddled up and ready to tackle yet another horde of zombies coming for them with no denial or confirmation that the character or characters survive the confrontation with a scratch that will turn them soon or no wounds whatsoever so they can continue fighting in a world that's no longer there's.</br>  Good night guys taking a break from this suffering  <br>I also follow the source material.<br><br> And you think you're any better than him by posting this? <br>No, but people need a reminder to stop acting like idiots.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks anon, I think that's good enough for me.</br>  <br> The franchise where zombies can walk indefinitely without any form of nourishment <br> Their bodies barely even break down even in places it obviously would <br>I always hated that.</br></br></br>  <br>How did she not catch the zombie STD if zombie blood got in her eye?</br>  <br> All resistance is futile when you're outnumbered 10000 to 1. <br>Zombies are like lepers, they'll eventually fall apart from their everyday shamblings. Doubly so if they actually need humans for sustenance.<br>Time is on your side; stay alive in your foxhole and you'll get to repopulate the world someday.</br></br></br>  <br>Remember to lock the door.</br>  <br>Which is exactly why there's no point in watching it. Why waste your time watching something bleak, hopeless, and depressing, that isn't even entertaining on top of that?</br>  That first episode was so fucking disappointing. Holy shit, did they stretch that shit out. It would have been so much better if they got that shit over with by A part and spent B part on actual survival stuff. Everyone knew what this series is and yet Lerche fucking exaggerated the reveal. 3/10 about as mediocre as Hamatora.  I wonder if I would realize something was off before the end if I didn't know what it was about already. There are a lot of subtle hints. Even the mood is kind of off. But I'm not sure. Might have just dropped it.  <br>I don't care how much Shovel likes the dog, i can't stand the mongrel. He's only there to die anyway.<br><br><br>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Shovel arts, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids with the shovel squad on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills with the shovel. I am trained in shovel warfare and I’m the top shovel wielder in the entire US armed forces. <br><br><br><br>Washing it out? I don't know ask the author.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's the strongest of all.</br>  <br> Everyone knew what this series is <br>/a/nons are not everyone</br></br>  <br>It's been confirmed that zombification works on every mammal.</br>  <br><br>I genuinely looked up the series to see if it would stay this fucking boring or if I should finish the first episode.<br><br>Hope the second one's more exciting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that all of what has been done in the first episode is the authors fault</br>  <br> He's only there to die anyway. <br><br>Him and everyone who isn't named Yuki.</br></br></br>  <br>Like, where did it come from? How does it even work?<br><br>How did a disease spread by someone staggering around drunkenly and attacking actually manage to make it so far?</br></br></br>  <br> Washing it out? <br>That's not how it works. You can catch every disease by getting the patient's blood in your eyes that are not normally transmittable.</br></br>  <br>I mean it's the same problems with everything zombie related.</br>  <br>The very existence of zombies could deny your theory.<br>It's unnatural for a body to move after death. Where does it even draw its energy from when all its organs have shut down.<br>Expecting them to simply decompose because it's "common sense" is unreasonable.<br><br>You could make an argument about still 'living' zombies, such as in  The last of us , more so since the fungus does exist.<br>But in that case, when the host approaches its death it finds a good spot and spreads its spores, so waiting on them to die naturally is even more problematic.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't think too hard about it. This ride is about despair and slice of life.</br>  <br>They're not dead.<br>They're just... retarded.</br></br>  <br>If you did, you wouldn't be so upset about spoilers. Stop acting like an idiot.</br>  <br>Read up the summaries. The English and Japanese ones both end with something along the lines of "there's something more to this shit." The Japanese Wikipedia page straight up says there are zombies in its two page story outline.</br>  Not enough Kurumi/Taroumaru interaction this episode.  <br>The only thing about the virus known so far is that the government knew before hand and its man made.<br><br><br>Well, maybe it doesn't work that way.<br>Its a made up disease anyway who knows how it works.<br><br><br>Rude.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, okay, even with that. There are people who are good tactical leaders who want to live with all of their might and are not going to let odds that are hopeless, terrible, depressing-- whatever-- trample them.<br><br>While our present society keeps us out of constant threat and danger and shelters us from facing the threat of death on a daily basis, it hasn't always been the situation. We've made it through times that we couldn't even realize were horrible because they were the everyday.<br><br>Ultimately, great leaders cope with these problems. A zombie series that I think you guys should read is the Newsflesh trilogy. In my opinion, it shows a more realistic outcome of a zombie "apocalypse". However, in the worst case, even later on in the Walking Dead you will see competent leaders and what they can do.<br><br>We've been to the moon. We didn't die to nuclear war. This zombie thing could and would be dealt with and if it happened I'd give it my best. There's other people who would too. Sorry to be cheesy, but the "oh we're all doomed" attitude is something I want to remedy.<br><br>Love this show though. Great setup. Disagree with people who thought the SOL was too long, it was really needed to build setting, drop hints, and hit hard. Also dat fang.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Two sentence story outline I meant to say.</br>  <br>The problem with those scenarios is that people either have never seen a movie or have only seen the wrong ones and make really stupid decisions. Honestly in a walking biter-type zombie situation there would be a very large amount of survivor strongholds even if you assume stupidity allowed the zombies to spread. As  said the elements would destroy most of the infected within a month or two even assuming they could move and attack after a full "death" effect. It's the airborne disease and/or sprinter type like in Left 4 Dead or I Am Legend that would actually do severe damage.</br>  <br> 0 budget </br>  <br> Think about it <br> Ruined forever <br>Welp, guess I'll skip ahead and read the Manga.</br></br></br>  <br>You're one to talk.

I bet you like traps.</br>  So what's the deal with this series? I was seriously disheartened by the first episode, I was pretty much on the verge or dropping this, but Anons kept praising it and saying it's the definite AOTS, so I decided to give the second episode a chance. What a mistake. I thought the fujobait would lessen after the initial exposition in episode 1, but it actually only got worse. Fucking hell, the very first scene is the absolute definition of female powerful bara wet dream.<br> Some bald buff ugly nigger is being a complete jerk and objectifying a woman that's passing by. Fortunately, he bumps into the uber strong white beautiful short bara who is about to fucking destroy the nigger but he doesn't because he is gracious and merciful, and frankly too strong to deal with suck small fries. <br>So pretty much 15 seconds into the episode and I want to barf. Some of the other obvious issues with this piece of shit series:<br> Glorification of prostitution. <br>The author just loves putting prostitutes on a pedestal, which is frankly disgusting. This is not something you can make light of, especially since women all around the world are suffering because of it. It's basically enabling women's suffering and sexual exploitation.<br> The main baddie is a PoC <br>Seriously? This bitch of an author should seriously check her goddamn privilege. Why are all the good guys pretty and white? Hell, one of the MCs is even blonde with blue eyes. Talk about racial stereotypes, golly...<br><br>Add to all that the excessive violence, the objectification of the males characters (all of them are pretty much female power fantasy), the blatant portrayal of women as powerless creatures in a patriarchal society, the constant sexual innuendos, as well as the all other typical fujobait tropes. Really, this must be one of the worst animes made as of recently.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's unpleasant to look at. Deal with it.</br></br>  <br>im too lazy to post a bait pic so just imagine i did</br>  <br> marathoning <br> first episode <br>How do you guys even manage to do this without passing out?</br></br></br>  <br>You have issues, if the dude has only a bit, it's kind of sexy. It shows off his virility.</br>  <br> You have issues <br>Being heterosexual?</br></br>  <br>But Nicolas is Asian.</br>  Is there anyone in the credits credited with the sign language research? I'm wondering how accurate this all is.  <br>It's a manga adaptation, idiot.</br>  <br>The faggot doth protest too much. Get out of that closet.</br>  <br>Heterosexual people aren't afraid of men.</br>  <br>how the fuck are these pubic hair? seems more like belly hair. I got them.</br>  <br> "nigger" and "PoC" in the same post <br> misogynist attack on women and SJW-esque defense of women in the same post <br>I don't even</br></br></br>  <br><br>Finding male pubic hair to be aesthetically unappealing = being gay and afraid of men<br>OK.<br>I just don't like looking at aesthetically unappealing things. I figure if I'm going to waste my life away watching anime I might as well at least make it anime that's nice to look at. That's why I always watch any anime by Kyoto Animation, except Free!, because half naked men are aesthetically unappealing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But the Free! guys don't have pubic hair, or pubic anything. They are ken dolls.</br>  <br>Your aesthetic sense is so shitty, you are a failure of a human being if the male form cannot be beautiful in some minor way to your eyes. Let me guess, you think other guys' dicks look nasty?</br>  <br> you think other guys' dicks look nasty? <br>Absolutely disgusting.</br></br>  <br>You are gay if you aren't attracted to anime men</br>  <br>Sorry to burst your bubble, but the sexuality between women can be just as depraved as the sexuality between men.</br>  Was the thread last week as bad as this one?  <br>It was 10 time worse.</br>  <br>Welp, maybe it'll get better later on when the shitposters get bored and move to something that attracts more attention.</br>  Daily reminder that this is undoubtedly the best pairing, and that everyone should hope this happens in the end.  <br> but the sexuality between women can be just as depraved as the sexuality between men. <br>It's at its most fun when it's depraved. Guys are just icky.</br></br>    <br>What if I find penises and vaginas equally disgusting?</br>  <br>Vampires</br>  <br>Cuties :3</br>  When do they fuck?  <br> Soldiers in some war 100 years ago took experimental addictive medicine that made them stronger, unfortunately it also affected their offspring and while they're stronger they also need to take the medicine on a regular basis, have mental or physical defects and only live about 30 years. </br>  <br>Yeah and they spend 2 volumes worth of pages every time he uses sign language to get everything in the Manga.<br><br>Good idea, retard.</br></br></br>  <br>That would never have happened if Umbrella was developing the serum.</br>  <br>You got it wrong. Shaving is gay, body hair is manly.</br>  <br>Yes, the Japanese Federation of the Deaf.</br>  Nina is CUTE.  So... the whore is never ever going to fuck someone again ? That´s like minus 3 points for me.  <br>Nico is like a cool older brother to Nina<br><br>It's pretty fucking cute</br></br></br>  <br>No, she does fuck someone  at the high point of her withdrawal from the TB meds Barry gave her. </br>  <br>so the first episode was really bad but I gave it another one, I don't see how this is going to get better, dropped</br>  <br> Umbrella was on the other side, they lost the war </br>  <br>Ditto. It's shit.</br>  <br>Which one will have to pay for it when they do?</br>  <br> Midget <br><br>Is Nic really a manlet? He doesn't look that short.</br></br></br>    Even Tsutchie can't save this.  <br>169 cm, or 5'5.5" in fat.</br>  <br>The happy trail is pubic hair.</br>  <br>Deaf Moe Muscle Manlet, very nice.<br> Captcha wants me to select the mountains. <br>How insensitive.</br></br></br>  <br> 1.69 <br><br>Poor guy.</br></br></br>  <br>Does being asexual suck? Or is it just whatever?</br>  <br>He's my height! I wonder how much he weighs.</br>  Is this worth watching? The characters look really hot  I want to fuck Nick  <br>He never really grew up, did he?</br>  <br> not knowing it was childish tripe the moment it was announced </br>  Why is a slanty eyed oriental midget called Nicolas?  <br>What's Iskandar doing there?</br>  <br>Likely an alias, or he was adopted by a family that gave him the name.</br>  <br>Disgusting sluts the both of them.</br>  <br>Because  it was probably his mum who was Asian and she was killed by his dad after she gave birth. </br>  typical toonami anime <br><br>Nothing wrong with that. The manga is rad too. Cool to see a good adaption of it. <br><br>Nina a miracle of the universe.</br></br></br></br>  What was that blank paper the doctor gave Nina?  I thought Nina was voiced by HanaKana.  It took me until Worick said 'baby' to realise he is voiced by Junichi Suwabe. It seems so obvious now.  <br><br>Underrated asshole.<br><br>I bet they fuck doggy style too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck, made me laugh.</br>  <br>Fucking hell he is so hot, makes me wonder why I've been fapping to girly twinky 2d boys all this time</br>  <br>He's qter as a shota to be honest.</br>  <br> Woric <br><br>I read that as Wojak</br></br></br>  <br>They're both extremely cute shotas but sometimes I forget I'm attracted to adult males as well</br>  <br>Alex is pure though.</br>  The yaoi hands are strong in this one.    <br> Nico x Nina is better <br> Nico x Worick is better <br> Scarface x arm is better </br></br></br>  <br>She  will be a great fuck in a few years. </br>  <br>I always get really anxious whenever a child shows up in a show like this.<br>Especially after what happened in Black Lagoon, and EVERYTHING that happened in Jormungand.</br></br>   'Gangsta' that look like football players <br><br>No.</br></br>  Wait, it's actually called Gangsta? It's not a joke name /a/ made up? Holy jesus  <br>No, Gangsta is just an acronym</br>  <br> Aoi Yuuki <br>Picked up.</br></br>   All those Nicholas ass shots in the second episode <br>Based Manglobe</br>  <br>We might have filled our damaged children quota with about every character's backstory and all the Twilights.</br>  <br>that made me diamond hard.<br>but he was wrong, she already is!</br></br>  <br><br> except Free!, because half naked men are aesthetically unappealing. <br><br>How is this aesthetically unappealing?<br>You a fag son?</br></br></br></br></br>  So everyone is actually speaking in english, right?  <br>Yeah.</br>  <br>Yep. You can expect a decent dub for the amerifats soon.</br>  <br> ottermode is shit <br><br>Get hueg and swole like a bear or a warrior.</br></br></br>  <br>There may be QUALITY, but the ass shots look great.<br>As usual, Manglobe has the best priorities.</br></br>  <br>Worik? More like whore-ik?</br>  <br>I always thought it was Italian, it seems like the show is set in pseudo-Italy.</br>  <br>Nah, it's English. The signs are in English.</br>  <br> As a straight man, I prefer my men to be shaven clean </br>  <br>people speak english in italy. hope you know that</br>  <br>They don't only have signs in English, nice try.</br>  <br>He said  I want to  hold hands with Nina  </br>  <br>Fuck off Nina is pure</br>  Why does he wear eyepatch?  <br>Because he doesn't want to show people his disgusting fucked up eye socket.</br>  <br>Because  his papa burnt his eye with a cigarette. </br>  <br>If this is true, I'm gonna be sad</br>    <br>My god</br>  <br>I wouldn't lie to you, Anon.</br>  <br>It's fine  Nico killed all his abusive family </br>   black tag makes fun of pro tag for using a sword in an age of guns <br> uses his fists and random objects as a weapon <br>:\</br></br>  Could someone tell me what the fuck was going on here?  <br> Did he do that out of spite because Wallace bought out his dad or out of protectiveness/gratitude? I've always wondered. </br>  <br>it's a blank paper, it indicates to the emptiness of her personality, since she's a whore, it's a medical diagnostic</br>  <br>I keep seeing this shota demon, who is he?</br>  <br>Likely  both </br>  <br>Mikhail,  one of the tagged hunters that shows up in volume 4. </br>  <br>Not even</br>  <br> Volume 4 <br><br>Shit. No chances of him showing up in the anime then, right?</br></br></br>  <br>Depends on how quickly they progress through the arcs. The mangas later volumes are much more action intense so they can choose to draw it out or shorten it.</br>  <br> He already did show up, anon. </br>  <br><br>Well shit, guess I'll have to read the mango</br></br>  why does noto mamiko only get roles where she's beaten and violated now?<br><br>what happened to her career?</br></br>  <br>Yeah that was fuggin regarded</br>  <br>It wouldn't be nice if they just rushed everything though. <br><br>Kinda wanted to wait till the anime was over, but, fuck it. I'll read the manga.<br><br><br>Where?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Check out the silhouettes in the big black weeaboo slaying scene.  If it was just the one silhouette it wouldn't be clear, but he's very often featured with another lead character who matched up with the other person in that scene. </br>  <br>Dummy.</br>   Literal powerlevels <br>well this escalated quickly</br>  <br>lol this.<br>So a B ranked just got absolutely destroyed by an A. Didnt realize A&gt;B massively. <br><br>Where is the S rank</br></br></br></br>  <br>You should. Didn't Worick dream in this episode? It was in chapter 2 in the manga. Probably a change for the better though.</br>  <br>Ginger is the only S rank that we know of so far. S/5.</br>  <br>A/0 is meant to be the highest rank but  Nico is also called "faker" because he gained his rank by beating higher ranked people than him and he overdoses on that drug to give himself a boost/edge when fighting. In reality he's closer to a B/4 </br>  Do we know how long this one will be? One cour or two?  <br>I completely forgot about that they were in this scene in the manga.</br>    I love Mikhail but he seems kinda out of place sometimes.  What the fuck is wrong with these guys? Who straight up drinks this shit?  <br>He has brain problems.</br>  <br>Europe</br>  <br>During the '80s that shit was like champagne.</br>  fujoshit  <br> I said it again! </br>  <br>but his brother and mother didn't even do shit</br>  <br>this is so moe I can't stand it</br>  <br> Junichi Suwabe <br>I had no idea at all till he went full dandy either.</br></br>  <br> They might not have done shit but they didn't exactly try and stop the abusive father either. I mean, Wallace had bruises 90% of the time, usually visible ones and he was pretty much secluded from them. </br>  <br><br>Is it okay to be homo for SuwaJun?</br></br>  <br>No. It's okay if you're GAR for him, though.</br>  <br>S rank move so fast they almost teleport</br>  I would read an entire series about these two as shotas.  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Shota Nic is the fucking cutest, jesus christ</br>  <br>The B rank was B-2, while Nico was A-0.<br>So it's not just one power level, it's however many the highest number is +2.</br></br>  <br>He's only Asian on his mom's side.</br>  <br>Retard moe.</br>  <br>She's around. If they get far into adapting then you'll see them at the tail end of the broadcast.</br>  <br>me too I want him to hold me gently and mutter obscenities at me</br>  <br>Nic is made for cuddling.</br>  <br>It's superior nipponesian bait folded over a million times<br>there's at least 2^1 000 000 layers to the bait</br></br>  <br>Yes. Body hair's normal, shaving your nuts and stomach is fucking weird. Or waxing or whatever you fairies do. Flipping out over a man not having groomed his pubic area to your liking can only mean you're a giant fucking faggot.</br>  <br>So what were they doing if not fucking?</br>  <br>Epilating is superior to both.<br><br>Just saying.</br></br></br>  <br>Worick was having a shower and Alex was puttering about and answering calls.</br>  There is no excuse to make this into a proper anime now right?  <br>Same. They're so cute and I really like their character designs</br>  <br>Only the very beginning was good.</br>  So how about that naked Worick in the OP?  <br>Spin it around so Shouko-chan is a cold-ass killer for hire besides the regular stuff in the manga and you got something.</br>  What is the deal with Dogtags?<br>What is are the Twilights?<br>What are the pills for?</br></br>  <br>Read either the manga or this thread.</br>  <br> &gt;Twilight (黄昏, Koukon) is the title given to the children and descendants of those who used the Celebre drug. While Ergastulum was created to control and house Twilights due to an influx of them after the war, they are still a source of controversy. Anti-Twilight factions are prominent in the city despite pro-Twilight support from three of the four Big Fathers.<br><br> From birth, they are registered and controlled using tags embedded with chips that monitor their vital signs. Thus, they are also known as "Tagged". These tags also have their rank - speculated to be a measure of the Twilight's strength - with D/5 (the default) being the lowest and S/0 the highest. After a Twilight's confirmed death, they are automatically deleted from their category and their family registration. Every record of their existence is erased. <br><br> Celebrer can be administered via three methods: pills, injections or bullets. Twilights require a controlled, continued amount of Celebrer in order to stay alive, as it maintains their vital functions and negates pain. Failure to regularly take Celebrer results in withdrawal symptoms, including dizzy spells, nausea, palpitations and migraines. More severe cases include haemorrhages, convulsions, hypothermia, hallucinations, laboured breathing and other irregularities in cardiopulmonary activity--after a certain amount of time, death occurs. Because a Twilight must take Celebrer to control their withdrawal symptoms, it's assumed that if a Twilight has children, they will also be Twilights. </br></br></br></br> </br>  <br>They're for identifying fellow Twilights.<br>Humans and the children of humans who were experimented on in a government supersoldier program.<br>Medication, it gives them strength and stamina greater than the average human and it also prevents them from seizure and cardiac arrest that will occur if they don't take them. Basically meant to control them.</br></br></br>  I just watched the opening on youtube<br>is this Fujishit?<br>kinda looks like it from the op, just half naked men getting dressed</br></br>  <br>Do you epilate your pubic hair?</br>  <br><br><br><br>So basically, nanomachine</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Now leave.</br>  <br>But a anime movie is already confirmed....</br>  <br>Yeah its hardcore gay sex every episode</br>  <br> just half naked men getting dressed <br> hurr fujoshit <br><br>Go back to hibike thread faggot</br></br></br></br>  <br> getting mad on the internet </br>  <br>Yeah bro, it comes with a sensitive area cap for that purpose. (And for armpits.)</br>  <br>I really hope they go for anime original plot. The manga was pure, unfiltered shit towards the end.</br>  <br>i dont know be hes doind an illuminati sign at the end</br>  <br>You are the strongest person alive if true</br>  <br>Hibike is fujoshit too</br>  <br>This girl is so sexy</br>  <br>It helps if you do it under the shower.

The OP was disappointing, but I'm digging the music. ED is pretty dope, too. Bit of a slow start, but I imagine they've got some set-up to do, so I'll see how it pans out.    <br>It's a slum city because it was originally meant to be a quarantine for all the Twilights like Nico.</br>  <br>Yeah, the music is pretty top tier. Really chill.</br>  <br>Is every thread going to be full of posts like this? Why are straightfags so fucking retarded? If I want to avoid a series with female fanservice I just google it and check the tags/genre/reviews.</br>  <br><br>so it's set in Australia?</br></br>  <br>Might as well be.</br>  <br><br>Fucking this.<br><br>Let me just info dump to this cum dumpster she clearly cares. <br><br>is the manga this bad?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What chapter was this again?</br>   Nic's face   <br>Like a bad Elvis impersonation</br>  <br>Chapter 10, but it's not even on-screen, Anon.</br>  <br>Is that neymar</br>  <br>No wait, it's chapter 11.</br>  <br>Thanks for telling me, even if it doesn't show</br>  <br>are you deaf?</br>  <br>I think it was him giving her a clean slate.

Ergastula were built underground on the villas of slaveholders or, less often, in city dwellings. Slaves kept there were shackled and were overseen by other slaves.

Pretty cool, I guess. I like the slower pace and the long stretches between music -- gives the city a very desolate sort of atmosphere.<br><br>Fights could be better. Kind of remind me of Samurai Champloo in the way they're cut and arranged but not nearly as well-executed.<br><br>Too early to make judgments on characters and plot yet. I'll stick with it for now.<br><br>But fuck me that music is so fucking good.

Currently the guild is being led by Gina Paulklee whose rank is unknown.

Cute loli nurse is a bonus. I sort of thought this was gonna be a shitty grimdark blood and guts type thing, and so far it is, but at least is has some fun elements.  <br>But B/2 to A/0 is quite a gap, but A/0 to S/5 is just one step.</br>  <br>anon you don't have a matching tattoo with your best bro?</br>  <br>Welp vol 7 of the manga went on sale in Nipland today, so maybe we'll find out soon.</br>  <br> She's so fast Nic was swinging his sword and she appeared a meter behind him. Erica and Mikhail ran when she appeared. She tends to end fights quickly so we haven't seen how powerful she is yet. </br>  <br> matching tattoo with your best "bro" </br>    <br>So basically it's like Deus-Ex all over again? <br><br>I kinda like that concept though.</br></br></br>  <br>She'd be a great fuck now.</br>  <br>Nicholas is the perfect blend of strangely cute and badass.</br>  Underwater vs Horriblesubs - quality of subs<br><br>/a/ go</br></br>  <br>Watch it raw</br>  <br>I like brown women</br>  <br><br>Why don't you go back there then?</br></br>  <br>On one hand I got drunk and branded myself with the rest of me company on my ass so I feel like I'm justified calling you a retard. <br><br>On the other hand the military is really fucking gay so I'm not going to</br></br></br>  <br>HS is using funi's subs, why are you even asking.</br>  So wait, is Big Boss superhuman too ?

AOTS easily  Those lips. <br>Those titties.<br><br>So no more lewd from Alex?<br><br>Damn shame.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's too late.</br>  <br> HS </br>  <br>Those lips were made for blowjobs, and those tits for paizuri.</br>  <br>She dress like a whore, so I'm sure that there will be more lewd.</br>  <br>doujins when</br>  designs are too homo for me.  <br><br>It's funny because the first time I saw gangsta posted in a rec thread a couple years ago I immediately thought it was a new hentai by ShindoL</br></br>  <br> on your ass <br>How do you explain that to your boyfriend?</br></br>  <br> rec thread <br><br>At least call them One page or manga thread, anon. You can't use that word here.</br></br></br>  <br>Best boy is Delico-chan.</br>  After /a/ claimed this was fujoshit i started to notice the undertones<br><br>Why did you fuckers ruin this for me</br></br>  <br><br>No, I distinctly remember it starting as a thread asking for recomendations and it derailed into the average OPT of no source giving porn crops to troll the OP. That's why I assumed at the time Gangsta was ShindoL.</br></br>  Discuss spoilers.  <br>Souma is the cutest MC. I want to marry Souma!</br>  First for best girls.  What was the fucking point of register a place if he can move freely later.  Phase 2 of Operation Defrost the Dairy Queen is underway.  <br><br><br> pic related <br>How much until she falls for Souman?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm guessing Souma plans to build up hype for the cart, then park in front of Yugi at the end for a head to head. He basically can't win in total sales, so he has to win for one day and of course, it'll be the last day.<br><br>Having said that, selling outside of your designated area seems like the kind of thing they wouldn't really allow.<br><br> Inb4 the school counts that against Souma and disqualifies any sales he made outside his area. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm still waiting for someone to add some car headlights to one of the pages where Erina does that face.  Waiting another week (or more) to find out who the mystery person is will be killer.  <br>Im guessing he's going to walk the cart around cooking them and using the site/smell to get people interested and advertise, but won't actually sell any until he returns to his own area.</br>  <br>It wouldnt surprise me if it was Marui.</br>  <br> is Ryou going to punch Hayama <br>I don't think so. His tone was more bored/exasperated and you could see him sigh in the spoiler image. A more accurate TL would've been<br> "Look who's talking" <br> "Oh, that's rich" <br>but it's hard to say taken out of context.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Thank you, anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone who says Souma is dumb or asexual or whatever isn't paying attention. He just has a goal and is really focused on it. He acts airheaded but there are always panels  that show that he's thinking about things he doesn't want to discuss out loud.  <br>They do need to advertise their spot if they want to attract people.</br>  <br>How does that prove he isn't asexual though?</br>  <br>So its listed on the map/newspaper/flyers? <br><br>It definitely seemed that with going with a cart his entire thing was moving around.</br></br></br>  <br>Tsukuda is finally putting Erina into more scenes with the main cast than ever before this past month or so.</br>  <br>If he's smart enough to read social cues then he's clearly aware of sexuality. Plus he remembered his dad's quote.</br>  <br>Until he shows some sexual attraction he doesn't have any sexual attraction</br>  <br>Because we're basically moving into E10 territory, Captain Obvious.</br>  <br>Nah. He's like the med student who studies all the time and doesn't go out with his friends.<br><br>Do you expect him to be some drooling doofus like Issei? The other boys could be called asexual too if we're going by that standard.</br></br></br>  <br>That's some retarded logic you got there.</br>  Soma is impressive in the way that he get almost every single girl in this manga trying to slobber all over his cock, but he never shows them anything other than friendship. I believe if he asked any girl in this manga for a date, they would probably accept.<br><br>Except Erina, but she'll come later.</br></br>  <br> almost every single girl in this manga trying to slobber all over his cock <br> almost every single </br></br>  <br> Almost every girl <br>As far as I remember the only one who has feeling for him is Nikumi, Mehgoo is starting to realize and Erina falling for him in the future is just the logical outcome.<br>So you have three girls out of what? 10?</br></br></br>  <br>The only girls interested in souma are nikumi and childhood friend.</br>  <br> Almost every girl <br>Just 2 girls, Erina and Megumi havent fall yet,</br></br>  <br>Megumi, Meat, Childhood friend. Slobbering on his dick might have been a little exaggerated, but I stand by the date comment.</br>  <br>You forget childhood friend.</br>  <br>Well Megumi has not fallen for him yet.<br> Childhood friend <br>Shit I didn't even remember she existed.</br></br></br>  I WANT TO FUCK ALICE  <br>She'll probably end up not being important again.</br>  <br>Seems like he'll use the smell and curiosity as his trump card. After everyone has seen and eaten just about everything, they'll be dying to know what that "mysterious" thing is.</br>  i want to cum in erina  <br> Well Megumi has not fallen for him yet. <br>After her and Soma finished teaching that one loli with Isshiki, I think she might have fallen a little bit. Or maybe I need to reread the manga.</br></br>  <br> Erina unknowingly opening up to Souma <br>I love this. I LOVE THIS.</br></br>  <br>You sure you will get past Mad Dog?</br>  <br>she had a doki moment, then forgot about it. Tsukuda confirmed not yet, so I imagine we'll know it when we see it. Megumi and Erina aren't going to fall the way Meat did, so we have to wait.</br>  <br> Actually happening <br> ACTUALLY HAPPENING <br> ACTUALLY HAPPENING </br></br></br>  <br>There's a difference between simply stating you find a girl hot or showing any interest whatsoever in the opposite sex and tripping over yourself with drool. And Soma has done none of them.</br>  <br> Erina: ...anyway, this is hardly the time to be worried about the other areas. // You have to concentrate on beating Kuga-san in the Central Area– <br>I like how she subtly shifted into wanting him to stay.</br></br>  <br>Isn't it just because she's annoyed Yugi disrespected the first years like the rest of them?</br>  <br>awww she actually wants him to stay. <br><br>I must say that I really like this arc right now because of the Souma and Erina conversations</br></br></br>       bunch of shotas sucking each other's dicks <br>Its called Boku no Pico.</br>  <br>The Wheel of time. The One power and shit would look great animated + awesome sword fights, harem, and giant battles.</br>    Different studio for each tale  What hit you harder, the ending to Gunbuster or EoE?  The ending didn't really hit me, since I had no clue what the fuck was going on. <br> But the fucking OST was magnificent. I got the best case of goosebumps when the EVA models started springing back to life over the sound of the soft eerie piano </br>  I cried just a little at the end of Gunbuster. <br><br>When Diebuster came to an end I spent an entire hour crying the same way I did when I lost my grandmother, shit, I wasn't even breathing properly. It was intense and I have no idea why.</br></br>  <br>I think Gunbuster trumps Diebuster in almost all the categories you mentioned. Sure Groovin' Magic is a great song, but most of the OP is just reused show footage. Lame. Both have great OSTs though. EP 5 of Gunbuster has some of the most beautiful artwork I've ever seen. Not to mention the decision to shoot the last episode like an old war documentary was brilliant. I'm not really a fan of super zany anime, so the story thing is just a matter of taste to me.</br>  <br>I didn't cry at all during either honestly. I just sat there with big stupid fucking grin.</br>  Both are pretty unforgettable, but EoE is really deeply etched into my mind, I think about it regularly even when it's not brought up almost a decade after seeing it.<br><br><br>The only thing that stuck with me from this tho is the  loli rocket decapitation </br></br></br>   GALAXY CROSSSS   <br>Was this deduced only from Chris's lines or are there other clues for time in the show?</br>  <br> not being completely blown away even after watching the PV and seeing preview pics </br>  <br>Kanade? More like KanaDead<br><br> and now I've made myself sad </br></br></br>  <br>I LOVE YOU!<br> Tsubasa &lt;3 </br></br>     A Hideo Kojima Anime <br> Definitely would watch </br>  Imagine a anime collaboration between Anno and Kojima. Just imagine how batshit fucking insane it would be.  <br>Smart choice since no one cares about Japanese directors and Hollywood directors are all unoriginal and adapt shit instead of making original movies these days.<br><br>Kojima would have been stuck doing cape shit and be known for doing cape shit.<br><br>Like at Micheal Bay's deathbed, they will only know him as a Transformers faggot director and nothing else.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> anno <br><br>Post disregarded.</br></br></br>  <br> 50 minute format <br> not 3 hour minimum films <br>This is how I know Kojima's a plebe. <br>That's what I'm going to do when my eventual manga is adapted and  I'm made director.  <br> ;_; </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> "The meeting only lasted for a short while, but the meeting was pure enjoyment and I have not had something like that in a while. <br><br> It was the first time we met but I felt like we had already known each other for a long time, I felt a kind of affinity that was like deja vu. <br><br> It’s a special privilege that only creators have. Even when age or race are completely different, we can still understand each other instantly when we have the same “smell”. <br><br> Even though we’re from completely different areas, it does raise my spirits to get to know people who are working really hard and suffering in agony but continue to still create new work." <br><br><br>A familiarity between hacks I see</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How many of you plebs are waiting for the best girl? the one who stay on top and even the author of shieldbro says she's the best. <br><br> Mature <br> Bondage <br> Legs, tons of legs <br> Boobs <br> Pseudo-ass </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She has a great personality.<br><br>She's just cursed to be a Bestiality-tier species.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>...Why a box?</br></br>  <br>They're taking about Crab's actual poll on his official site, ass-breather.</br>  <br> Breastafagtrontards <br>D-Did I give you what you want?</br></br>  <br><br> Can spiderlady ward off other spiders from entering darling's home? I dislike spiders (a lot) but like her. <br>Same. I would love it if she could do this.<br><br> How would she feel if someone killed a spider in front of her? <br>She probably does so herself as well. From what we've seen Monmusu have zero emotional connection to animals they happen to physically resemble.</br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>]
