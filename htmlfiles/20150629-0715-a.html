How long do stuff usually go on sale at Amiami?<br>There's a nendo I'm thinking of grabbing but I'll be going overseas for around 20 days in a week. If I buy it now, I'm worried about not being able to pick it up while I'm gone if it arrives. If I wait until I come back, what are the chances of it still purchasable?</br>  <br>Who knows.<br><br>Another choice would be: wait until it's July, then order something released in late July along with that. That item will delay the shipping and payment until said date and you will still have that nendo ordered.</br></br></br>  <br><br>If you buy it and get EMS shipping it'll be there by Wednesday/Thursday.</br></br>  <br>It must be nice to have money</br>  <br>Wait Shiki's up for preorders already?</br>  <br>You will get it in 2-3 days if you choose ems</br>  <br><br>How much does it usually cost to go EMS for a single Nendo? $20?<br>If what the other anon said is true, it might be better for me just to buy a strap or something to delay the shipping.<br>Alternatively, is it possible to email them or something and ask them to delay the shipping?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends on the weight and where you live. Read their shipping FAQ.</br>  <br>Check the guide.</br>  <br> Alternatively, is it possible to email them or something and ask them to delay the shipping? <br>They won't do such thing.<br><br>Anyways, EMS would be roughly 1500 JPY, RSAL is 990JPY.</br></br></br></br>  If you had 3D printer, which figure would you print in live size?<br><br> http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-ne<wbr>ws/2015/06/22-1/life-sized-to-love-<wbr>ru-momo-figure-exhibited<br>http://akiba-weekend.blog.jp/archiv<wbr>es/1031761091.html<br>http://blog.livedoor.jp/nichirou/ar<wbr>chives/54437794.html</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></wbr> </br></br>  <br>Some nendoroid can sold ot pretty fast but some wont, It is hard to tell. Probably it is a good idea to preorder straps or something and ship both together in order to delay the shipment.</br>  <br>Can't afford anything big right now.</br>  What's up with those items on Manda which say "they can't be shipped in SAL" but they actually can? If I order something and request SAL, will they cancel it? Because other people on MFC have bought the item using SAL so I know it's possible/    <br> Good Misaka figures when? </br>  <br>When Misaka Worst gets an appearance in anime.</br>  <br>This one is decent.</br>  <br> &gt;When Misaka Worst gets an appearance in anime. <br>So never.</br></br>  <br>Is that a fucking Shiren nendoroid?!</br>  <br>Yeah. Speaking of my copy of Shiren 5+ has been stuck in EMS hell since the 18th.</br>  <br><br>Never played one of those games. Seem kinda cool, reminds me of Azure Dreams. Wii one is the only english one isn't it?</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry about that, well gotta pre-order. Now that makes him and Black Heart the only figures I'll be getting.</br>    <br>The DS one is in English, I believe it's a port of the original SNES version. The WIi version is probably the weakest of the series, since they let you keep your items once you die (which defeats the whole point of the game being a "roguelike").</br>  Is this the best Satsuki fig out there aside from the prize figs  <br>The nendoroid and the prize are the only good ones she has.</br>  <br><br>The senketsu one isn't terrible if you don't mind the awful hair seam.</br></br>  <br>Sega prize figure &gt; nendo &gt; figma &gt; banpresto prize figure &gt; phat figure &gt; crackwhore figure &gt; RAH</br>  <br>please respond</br>  <br>Any idea about this?</br>  <br>go on your local cragislist you can probably find a closing down store and pick up some nice cases for not a lot of cash.</br>  <br><br><br>Alright then guess I'll get the prize figures instead. They cost less together than the 1 fig anyway. Thanks for the advice.</br></br></br>  How many figures have you bought and received in the last 6 months? <br><br> 1 </br></br>  <br> 000 <br> At least payday is coming up and I'm out of my debts and shit. </br></br>  <br>12.<br><br> 22 if I include mecha/toku </br></br></br>  <br>13.<br><br> Most are nendo.

I see space problems in my future.</br></br></br>  I'm looking at K-On figures, which is your favourite out of these three?  <br>4, thats also quite a lot for me, im new to this hobby and dont require too much, just slowly catching up on the few i missed and buying only if it's a fantastic steal</br>  <br>Am I the only person who has Chieri preordered?<br>I think she has the potential to be the cutest figure of the year.</br></br>  <br>azu is pretty cute, I like poses where they're just not standing around, although mio has the most emotion</br>  <br>3 and  10 gundams. </br>  OOOOoOOOooOO THIS IS THE GHOST OF CHRISTOPHER LEEEEEE BUY ME OR MY SPIRIT WILL NEVER FIND REST OOOoOoOOoOoOO  When do you guys think we'll see all 5 done? 2017?  <br>Thanks for that laugh, anon.</br>  <br>24<br>I kinda just started last November and didn't really get running until January though</br></br>  <br><br> N-Y <br> lowers the price <br><br>Sure, go ahead.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Jelly as fuck of that Sonya/Yasuna statue.</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure he meant declared value anon.</br>  <br>15</br>  <br>I''ve been leaning towards Yui to be honest. Mio is probably my least favourite of the three, and the most expensive.</br>  <br>N-Y send items as a gift but use the company name, you can try asking them to send it under a personal name which should help it get through customs. No idea if they would though.</br>  What's the lowest price you guys saw for the Celty 1/8 figure?  <br>Please be more specific. There are 3 listed on MFC.</br>  <br>Get Stronger's Yui.<br><br>Get all 5.</br></br></br>  <br>Ritsu is the only one I'm interested in here. Possibly Mugi for that tummy.</br>  <br>I only want Mugi and Mio.</br>  <br>I really hope Mio's hat can be taken off.<br>I also missed preorders for Azusa, hopefully I will be able to find her for a reasonable price in the aftermarket.</br></br>  <br>I'd get all 5 if I could, but I'll just have to settle for Ritsu and Yui. They have my favourite outfits and poses.</br>  <br>Delays everywhere</br>  I hope Nancy Lee gets a figure  <br><br>Yui, Mugi and Ritsu are the only good ones there.<br><br>Asuza has a retarded pose that has nothing to do with the others, aside from that tear slapped on her cheek, and Mio has the ridiculous hat and shit on her right leg, hell, even the jacket clashes and is out of place with the rest of the picture.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Alter one that's up for preorder</br>  <br>Really wish the full art for each of them was available somewhere.<br><br>I was able to get Azusa from N-Y a day after the cutoff, was sold out directly after my order.</br></br></br>  <br>I think Azusa has the single best pose of the group, and Mio clashes because she's the frontman.</br>  Well, seems like I will buy another Aquamarine bunny soon.  <br>The only answer is all fifteen.</br>  Charlotte bunny on possible purchase list.  <br><br>Still trying to decide if Shiki and Rin are worth the hassle and price, since they will basically cost me the same as the Kongo bust.</br></br>  <br>Don't live somewhere with an Aniplex+ retailer?</br>    <br>Still upset that her scales are so shitty.</br>  <br> huge titties <br><br>excellent taste</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sadly no, I would need to ask a relative that lives in California to get them for me, but even then, with how expensive shipping is from USA to  Mexico  he would end up asking me like $140 or something.</br></br>  <br>Rightstuf doesn't ship to Central America?

How do you go about just splitting off one part of the order but leaving the rest on AmiAmi. I've only ever canceled one thing before, but that was just one order made up of only one fig. Is AmiAmi more prone to wield the ban hammer if its my second cancellation? I've bought plenty of things from them before so I wouldn't think its a problem. Pic unrelated just looks nice. Any help is appreciated, thanks.  <br>If you know how to put a condom then it should be easy bro</br>  <br>I do, and it's not the same thing.

I guess we'll know soon enough.</br>  <br>Cashgrab, like, durr.</br>  So what's the deal with this special airing in a few hours? Is it going be a full episode or shorter? I assume it's going to cover some of the manga scenes that got cut.  good man  <br><br> 4 Seeds <br> 493 leechers <br><br>Seriously you guys?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Seeders are the ones who patched the raws.</br></br>  <br>I'm seeding the last 2 episodes only since I didn't bother to download 1-10.</br>  I'd love to help the few people ho still haven't died in here, but my connection is way too poor for uploading stuff, so I just grabbed 11 and 12 and ran off. I even have problems uploading large images to 4chan, so please forgive me. I promise I'll seed properly once I have a decent upload speed or at least a connection that doesn't kill itself while uploading.<br>By the way Rio is the best.</br>  The number of seeds went from about 4 to 200 in the past five minutes. Anyone just now discovering this thread should ignore all previous complaints about speed.<br><br>Thanks a bunch to the few anons who helped. You probably ended up doing about 70% of the work tonight. It really would've just been me for at least a full day or two without your help. Now I might actually be able to get some sleep before starting on subs for this special.</br></br>  <br>Sleep tight Ron</br>  <br>Sieg is the strongest!</br>  <br>thank you TL anon, but I somehow wish for another studio to actually remake it with better art &amp; animation.</br>  <br>Thank you based Ron, sleep well.</br>  Why couldn't they have just said "13 episodes"? Why do 12 episodes and then 1 that airs in practically the same time slot one week after the finale and not even bother to announce it until hours before its airing?  <br>It's an event or something, not an episode.</br>  What part of the story did S1 cover up to?  <br>The finale ended with Vivio's next opponent being Miura. <br>And Einhart's next opponent is the champion. <br>I hope that helps<br>Lutecia and the witch also fought filler girls to introduce their magic<br>(What does the witch even do? A psychological assault?)</br></br></br></br></br>  Did the anime skip anything important? If not, what chapter can I start at in the manga?      <br> story </br>  Is there even enough material for S2?  <br>Yes. The manga continues quite a bit past where the scanlations currently cut off.

Meant to write fagart.</br>  <br>Always Subaru.</br>  <br>What really annoys me is that the rules of the tournament kinda screw over everyone who is not a pure martial artist so people with limited techniques like Einhart end up having an advantage over more skilled magical girls</br>  <br>Since everyone gets a personal instance of their waifu, there is no problem.</br>  <br>Olivie is the best.<br><br>Just the best.</br></br></br>  <br>That half naked Fate....Oh god yes</br>  <br>Well, you can see it was written with all intent to make Corona look good for losing, even if the sotry simply demanded that Einhart wins.<br><br>So they put a so much of oomph into Corona in that fight that Einhart really looked like a total bore. But as said, it was just outlined like that from the beginning. In a way, it was a plot armor on Corona too, but it was not "win" plot armor, just "look cool" plot armor.<br><br>They didn't want Corona to just lose the obvious "hey she was weakest from them so duh" way. IMHO they should switch it a bit and have Einhart fight with Rio.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fag</br>  Hey anon? What are you doing on the floor?  <br>Stunned by your cuteness  ♥ </br>  <br>It's a trap. Now I'm gonna rape you.</br>  <br>trying to look at your panties...can you lift your skirt a little higher?</br>  <br> Making High Queen look embarrassed <br><br>I approve of this plan.</br></br></br>   vivid <br> good </br>  <br>Queen of my dick</br>  <br> Anonymous <br> good taste </br></br>  <br>Reminder that Teo was the first inside Einhart.</br>  <br>unlikely considering the kind of life she was living</br>  <br> you <br> real </br></br>  <br>That's nasty, anon.</br>  <br><br>Corona really should have won, but plot can be a bitch. As someone that can relate to the limitations of being less talented than athletic peers, I'll probably always root for her.</br></br>  <br>And daily remember that unspecified red relic was the first inside Vivio, and Nanoha's big fat pink thing was the first inside Fate.</br>  <br>So, who was first inside Nanoha? That gadget drone that was first inside Vita?</br>  <br> Shamal </br>  <br>OMG</br>  See you in season 2.   Hey loser, get in the bed   <br><br>Having limited techniques does not an unskilled fighter make. When it comes down to it, Einhart is better at thinking on her feet and reading her opponent. Corona is more versatile and probably a better overall decision-maker, but everything she does requires a lot of prep time and foreknowledge. In a tournament setting, she's already out of her element since she can't prepare for everybody. Plus, if it were an actual fight she would've won. Einhart got saved by the bell and the rules like 2 or 3 times.</br></br>  <br>did she died?</br>  <br>Only a light coma</br>  <br><br> Where's your counter-hit now Saint Kaiser of Belka? </br></br>  <br>And mild case of underboob exposure.</br>  <br>Of course but I was not talking only about that fight<br>In general the rules seem to favor martial artist a lot in order to create an equal ground for the fight and thats unfair in my opinion<br>They are able to freely give their best on what they are best while on the other hand people like Lu or Corona are severally handicapped</br></br></br>  <br>OTP</br>  Vivid was a mistake  <br>God damn YES<br>Best pairing</br></br>  <br>You being born was a mistake</br>  <br><br>Well it's a Strike Arts focused tourney so it can't be helped.

Corona would have won if it weren't for Round 1 getting timed-out but as I said, plot armor.</br></br>  <br>I really can't imagine a studio capable of pulling off Innocent in all its cute lewdness and badassery</br>  How did Vivio lose when she had main character plot armor  <br>Kyoto Animation</br>  <br>There isn't.<br>Like 50% of the reason Innocent is good is because of SYU's art</br></br>  <br>They already proved they can't do action</br>  <br>Who cares about action.</br>  <br>Their old Full Metal Panics were pretty good, but most likely everyone that worked on them already left their studio.</br>  <br>I do, All the matches so far were a lot of fun<br>Do you really think the current kyoani can do justice to a series like Innocent?<br><br><br>Yes they used to do good shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not even remotely the same thing.<br><br>Corona's basically a little girl using Berserker Armor. I hope she doesn't give up on using it entirely.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd dokidoki fashion check Fate if you know what I mean</br>  <br>No longer alive in canon.<br>No strong lolis allowed.</br></br>    <br>This kind of SoL is what's missing from Vivid.<br>It's not really a character which can only think and talk about fighting 24/7.</br></br>  This is one of the best things ever.  <br>Finally watched Ep 11 and 12 back to back. Did anyone else feel the urge to choke a Corona, or was it just me? I don't remember getting this mad when reading about the fight in the manga, but damn, the little shit needed to get the shit beaten out of her this time.</br>  <br>I know right? Fucking botters.<br>Why is this allowed?</br></br>  <br>Conversely, I'm still annoyed that Corona somehow became the focus of the episode and was actually slated to win. She was risking both her own body and her opponent's just because she didn't want to appear weak. This is EXACTLY the same shit that Subaru and Teana tried to pull on Nanoha, only for some reason now it's a good thing rather than a bad thing. She deserved to get a lot more BTFO than she did.</br>  <br> What is Kyoukai no Kanata </br>  <br>See <br>I figured out why it annoyed me so much now.</br></br>  <br>Tea and Subaru were neglecting the basics to learn gimmicky shit. Corona never had "the basics" to begin with because her style of magic is totally unique. If anything she was trying to get back to Strike Arts in her own way.</br>  <br>I don't think Nanoha would be that pissed with them just because they ignored her training regiment (although that played a part). Mostly it was the fact that they essentially used a suicide bomber tactic just so they could snatch a win, with no regards to how dangerous that was to them. Which is exactly the same thing Corona is doing, and without the excuse of actually training for real combat where anything goes. She was just a selfish brat putting herself and others in danger out of some perceived sense of weakness (which was never mentioned or illustrated before this) and somehow this was portrayed as something admirable.</br>  <br> lift weights while sleeping <br>Sasuga haou</br></br>  <br> I don't think Nanoha would be that pissed with them just because they ignored her training regiment <br>Pretty much the first thing she asks them is "Where did I go wrong? Is my training not good enough for you?"<br><br>Everything else in your post is just fanwank. Anything that disregards the fundamentals is going to be inherently dangerous.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Corona was fighting like she was in a sporting tournament, fighting like she's in a war. Tea and Subaru were in a war, fighting like stupid teenagers.<br><br>Nanoha "Zenryoku Zenkai" Takamachi would sooner support Corona than berate her. She literally does the exact same thing "go beyond my limits at risk to my body" thing in every single major season.</br></br></br>  <br>Corona was in a sporting tournament, fighting like she's in a war.*</br>  <br>They outright stated that Corona's technique was dangerous. Hell, she apparently shattered every bone in her body (never mind how she was apparently fine not two hours later) trying to pull that move. No matter how you want to slice it, (and mind you,I'm not conceding the point about "fanwank", just ignoring it because it's a different discussion) that's not the kind of behavior that you present as admirable.<br><br>Except the very reason Nanoha was pushing her limits was precisely BECAUSE she had no choice. And she knows more than anybody how much she paid for it. If there's anyone that wouldn't allow that kind of reckless behavior for a frakking tournament, it's her.</br></br></br>  Corona really put herself into a lot of danger by pulling that. <br><br>It just makes her all the more deadly in real combat though. She just won't go down until you knock her out.</br></br>  Bottom line of the story, lolis are fucking weak, get an adult form or get rekt.<br>Thank you "based" Vivid.</br>  <br> Hell, she apparently shattered every bone in her body (never mind how she was apparently fine not two hours later) <br>Nice job demonstrating complete ignorance of the story.<br><br> Except the very reason Nanoha was pushing her limits was precisely BECAUSE she had no choice. And she knows more than anybody how much she paid for it. If there's anyone that wouldn't allow that kind of reckless behavior for a frakking tournament, it's her. <br>And of Nanoha's character.<br><br>She was the only one spamming magic cartridges and nuking the fuck out of everything in a friendly sparring between 11-year-olds. Nanoha doesn't give a single fuck about going all out, she just makes damn sure people fight smartly when they're doing it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> lolis with no years of training or experience of real combat, are fucking weak compared to those that has them <br>Fixed.<br><br>The solution is for the lolis to train more and work hard, nigga.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't bother with him.</br></br>  <br>Nah, the solution is for them to grow up.<br>Vivio or Einhart are the same person in adult form, still they can be strong unlike their shitty loli form.<br>Obviously not as strong as glorious adult womyn.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm glad that lolis are weak as shit and not badass <br>You don't have to be so obvious about it.</br></br>  <br>A larger body is advantageous in a martial arts sport? You don't fucking say?</br>  What is the cast even working up for at this point? I am reading the manga and it feels like still nothing of much value has happened despite the tournament arc. Just more consolation stuff with "muh memories".<br><br>Is there any sub-plot in the background in the untranslated chapters that at least signals something is going down or is it the same old same old?</br></br>  <br>Your interpretation of Nanoha's character is at best as good as mine, In this situation though, with you glaringly ignoring half her fucking characterisation to make your point. I don't even have to bother arguing.</br>  <br>Yes, that makes so fucking much sense, that's why the strongest people in Vivid are 220 cm tall bulky men.<br>Fucking idiot.</br></br>  <br>My interpretation doesn't involve replacing a key scene regarding the subject with fanfiction.</br>  <br> grown men in a children's tournament <br>Yeah, you're retarded.</br></br>  <br>There are grown women too in "a children's tournament".<br>Fuck off apologist scum. And this is all no reason the lolis should be weak as fuck, yet they are.</br></br>  <br>The tournament max age is 19 years old isn't it? A 19 year old male could come in and be pretty bulky. But this is Nanoha so all the top fighters are female.</br>  <br>No, there are children who learned, practiced, mastered a body-enhancement spell with all the included disadvantages of doing such.<br><br>It's no wonder Miura went the furthest, since she spent more time on practicing instead of gimmicky magic, and learned to fight in the body she does everything else with.</br></br></br>  <br> Implying there will be another season. </br>  <br>I still don't understand why doesn't Vivio take a fighting style akin to Nanoha and Fate. She has 2 of the Aces of the TSAB to draw upon but she still pursues Strike Arts as her main form. <br><br>At this point she doesn't do anything well but counter.</br></br></br>  <br> The clone of Saber Jesus and the descendant of the second greatest fighter in the Belkan age are strong <br>Vivio has superior Sankt Kaiser genes, nigga. And she fought against Nanoha that has gone all out for a bit in StrikerS, she has a bit of combat experience.<br>And Einhart has Klaus' memories, so she knows the moves that he knows, also, probably some belkan combat experience.<br><br>And you know who is stronger than both of them? Sieg, who has the skills and combat experience of every fucking Jeremiah in each era. The only people who can match Sieg in combat experience is probably the Wolkenritter, if they remember everything from the years of being under the Book.<br><br>What determines whether someone is strong? A combination of talent, skill, and experience.<br>No talent? No problem, work hard. Sufficient amount of skill from training can overcome talent. See: Miura<br>No skills? Work hard, nigga.<br>No experience? Go get yourself some by fighting in tournaments or something.<br><br> Vivio <br> actually talented in shooting, but goes martial arts, not using her talent much <br> Training with Nove <br> Some experience of getting nuked by Nanoha <br><br> Einhart <br> Klaus' memories, so we can assume she already has some innate talent for martial arts <br> Training with Nove, and alone <br> Experience of starting street fights with random fighters </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And they are still weak as fuck, never get beyond "strong for a kid" tier.<br>Because only grown ups can be really strong.</br></br>  <br><br>Isn't the damage mostly simulated anyway?<br>Sure, they can get hurt, but much, much less than normally possible.</br></br></br>  does this tournament have responsible concussion protocols  <br>INNOCENT is pure suffering if you're a fan of Vita. At least in other timelines she keeps some dignity and bravery even in her fateful encounters. But here she's the fucking laughing stock of Brave Duel.</br>  <br> taking the dignity away from the only one that's consistently a loli in all iterations <br><br> still better than ViVid where they can't even think of going up against adults </br></br></br>  <br>Obviously you missed the part of the episode where Nove scolded Corona for developing such a thing nor the part where Otto talked Corona out of said mode with a rousing speech. Or the part where Einhart was conflicted about a similar technique designed to fight in times of war being used in sports competition. <br><br>Corona was mistaken but her drive to demonstrate her effort to validate her place among her friends is what's worthy of admiration. Also pretty interesting because its kinda unusual seeing such character archetype showing such honest ambition to stand out. Corona overworked herself and tripped but during the attempt she realized her true strength and developed her own pride. The problem was similar to Teana's but the motivation and circumstances where different. As Nove mentioned, they have the wonderful chance to allow themselves such mistakes and learn from them which is a luxury the forwards facing real danger don't have.</br></br></br>  <br>That's more or less been directly pointed out in the story. She's suited for aerial magic but does the strike arts for some reason instead.<br><br>I suspect that she's actually afraid of fighting because of the events of StrikerS, and so only does a style of fighting that's relevant in a controlled environment. It would also explain why she's a counter hitter.<br><br><br>Pic related. Your so-called overpowered grown-ups still got shit on by children.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Corona  <br> not badass <br>I don't think you know the meaning of that word too well, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>The thing with Corona's ability is that it's not inherently dangerous if she uses it responsibly either.<br><br>Unlike Tea who was abandoning her role as a ranged fighter to go all LOL DAGGER ATTACK instead, directly putting herself in harm's way. Nephelim Fist actually gave Corona a form of CQC defense and for the most part was simply a way to help her stand up to the others in Strike Art's.<br><br>The ability was basically the manifestation of both her desire to be a strike artist rather than a summoner (similar to Vivio and aerial magic), and her inferiority complex (copying all her moves from her friends).<br><br>I hope she keeps using the ability anyway. Reducing her pool of tricks just seems like a waste of design.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"How cute, that's pretty neat...for a kid!"<br><br>Lolis are weak in ViVid compared to adults, that's a fact.</br></br></br>  <br>She can always just use Nephilim Fist Full Control on a smaller Goliath anyway.</br>  <br> "How cute, that's pretty neat...for a kid!" <br>Doesn't take any of the baddassitude away. Corona showed lots of guts, nerves of steel, cleverness and developed a technique with huge potential (favored by both the Jeremiah and the Sankt Kaiser both beings that would put most modern adults to shame in combat).</br></br>  <br>It kinda takes away all badassery when it's just a sports game for juniors.</br>  <br>Not when you're an average level competitor taking on the prodigy inheritor of the rival of magical Jesus and nearly win with everything you've got. <br><br>Nanoha would've exploded in excitement has she was there to witness the fight. It's like that story of a guy in the dawn of industry competing against a machine and barely winning while pretty much self destroying himself. It's both tragic and awesome, and badass overall.</br></br></br>  <br>You're wrong, that's a fact.</br>  <br>Nothing badass in this.<br>Not when Nanoha could wipe the floor with both at the same time with her eyes closed. <br>Just children playing. And the little one losing.</br></br></br>  <br>That's not nephelim fist anymore, just regular golemancy. The whole point of nephelim fist is that she was essentially using herself as a golem.<br><br>Still a smaller Goliath would be pretty sweet. Goliath does a shitload of damage but he has like two moves and neither one are very practical whatsoever against a skilled opponent.</br></br></br>  <br> but he has like two moves <br>Exactly.<br>Using Nephilim Fist, which includes a lot of other people's moves, on Goliath would give him more moves.<br>And Corona doesn't have to worry about backlash from using moves she isn't familiar with, since Goliath is using them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Vita wiped the floor with Nanoha and Reinforce basically ignored her maximum effort. Yet nobody questions her badassitude and bravery. You're talking biased nonsense. <br><br>Lutecia alone could give Nanoha a worthy fight but this is not about powerlevels is about attitude and determination and in that sense Corona stole the show for a moment. <br><br>Also its inaccurate that you hate on lolis being weak so much. There are teenagers and young adults there as well getting their butts wrecked by lolis. And Micaiah was no slouch. Her max score was 3rd place, so she's at least around Victoria's level. Moira's victory was impressive but also lucky, she was on the ropes right from the start.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Bring on season 2. <br>Please no.</br></br>  <br>Nephelim Fist isn't about the moves though, the reason Goliath has a tiny movepool is because he's fucking massive, slow, and has to hit a tiny target. This means he's basically limited to punching or stomping the ground if he actually wants to be useful.<br><br>Nephelim Fist specifically refers to the usage of golemancy on her own body. If it's on a golem, it's just golemancy.<br><br>There's nothing stopping her from creating a small golem with Golemancy, and making it use Rio's moves with Golemancy. They're all just named variations on punching/kicking anyway. She can do all that, it just wouldn't be Nephelim Fist.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We won't see eye to eye.<br>You are satisfied with lolis being strong for lolis. I want them to be the strongest, not "scoring a relatively good place" in a tournament for them, because fuck this it's a fiction where all kind of crazy shit already happens.</br></br>  SILLY GIRL, YOU'RE A RIDER<br>YOU SHOULDN'T USE CASTER'S MOVES</br>  Is it wrong if I start shipping Einhart with Corona.  <br>It actually enforces fighting with concussions. So...</br>  <br>Then you're just a powerlevel faggot. I bet Goku was your favourite character at some point. I enjoy seeing characters growing as they face challenges. <br><br>But lets wait and see. Vivio is slowly remastering her Magical Jesus powers. If she manages to control that power she'll be ableto stomp over most of the old cast.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not a powerlevel faggot.<br>But lolis are just playing, while the real people who actually matter in the universe are the adults.</br></br>  <br>I just want to see Corona summon a massive golem around herself like a mecha and then pilot it using Nephilim Fist.</br>  <br> clones/reincarnations/inheritors/d<wbr>escendants of key hystorical figures of great power and presence in the old belka.</wbr> <br> irrelevant.  <br><br>I bet you think the Huckebein are more important.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They are irrelevant unless they go into adult mode hence stop being lolis.</br>  <br>Adult mode Einhart roflstomped by a teenager. Adult Mode Vivio wrecked by hard hitting loli. <br><br>Your argument is invalid.</br></br></br>  <br>Then they are all irrelevant thus making your point invalid.<br>When they can defeat an S rank mage without limiters, I'll say they are relevant.</br></br>  <br>I want to rub Corona's bare shoulders, if you know what I mean.</br>  When the fuck will Tsuzuki announce 'Lyrical Nanoha: Escape from the corner I've written the series into'.  <br>When red snow will fall, and lolis will be popular again.</br>  <br>Just think about what she could do if she copied Sieg's moves. That's basically one of the Jeremiah's fighting styles that they taught to Olivie back in the Belkan era. <br><br>Sieg's automatic answer to dangers is also similar to Corona's automatic counters. I wonder if they will develop this further.</br></br></br>  <br>They won't. Don't get your hopes up.</br>  <br>This twisted series needs to be reset.</br>  <br>Fabia is a loli witch who defeated Lulu (S class mage). So there.<br><br>And we don't know the ranks of most of the little girls since that's a military thing, but we at least know that most of the finalists can fly or levitate (except Miura and Harry).</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't think that would work out very well. Everyone's too fast and has too much firepower for her to make herself a big target like that. If she misses one move she's fucked, whereas she still has a chance if Goliath takes the fall instead.</br></br>  <br>I hope so. I want Corona to become a monster.</br>  <br>Your waifu is pathetic. She needs to be whipped into shape.</br>  <br><br>THey need to learn from hollywood.<br>A reboot a reboot!</br></br></br>  <br>Innocent is bad like that in general. It's mostly for people who get high on the materials from GoD, the other characters are kinda derp. No idea how it is once the StrikerS cast appears.</br>  <br>fuckoff</br>  <br> I hate fun </br>  <br>Not really, it is just not very good. I found that I just could not recommend it to other people who watched Nanoha at all. Vivid I did, with hic sunt SoL or some other disclaimer like that, but Innocent, not really. I can read it, but I can't see a reason somebody who is not hopeless would.</br>  <br>You are taking Innocent far too serious.</br>  <br>you what nigga</br>   You can have any magical girl you want as long as it's a Corona <br><br>What did he mean by this?</br></br>  http://aritedrop.blogspot.fi/2015/0<wbr>6/nanoha-innocent-chapter-12.html?m<wbr>=0<br><br>New Innocent out.</br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br>Wait, 12? I'm missing some then.</br>  Materials movie when?  <br>They have their own video game so NEVER</br>    <br><br><br> tfw Stern vs Nanoha animated never <br>I want a battle between 2 of the most battlesexual characters animated.</br></br></br></br>  <br>One day, anon. One day.</br>  <br>Yep, Fabia has pretty OP stuff in her repertoire. She can potentially Fuck up members of the adult old cast pretty good.<br><br> but we at least know that most of the finalists can fly or levitate (except Miura and Harry). <br>Wait. Does that mean Sieglinde can fly? Because if that's the case then she'll kick major adult ass. Flight is like the only solid advantage Nanoha and the others had over her.</br></br></br></br>  Lutecia grew up to be so fucking hot god damn. It's too bad Zest is gone though.  <br> It's too bad Zest is gone though. <br>What exactly do you mean with this?</br></br>  <br><br>I know right? I'm glad Tsuzuki doesn't cave in and cater to their kind, instead doing what he wants to do.</br></br>  where is da lolis?  <br>Where do you guys get that they can fly? Moving in zero gravity is something different, obviously. Lutecia can though, you see her levitating in the matches.</br>  <br> Flight is like the only solid advantage Nanoha and the others had over her. <br><br>You mean despite their power and skills?</br></br></br>  <br><br>What are you gonna kick my ass depending on my answer or what? I liked Zest and I wish he was still alive.</br></br>  <br> skills.  <br>You're not serious are you? <br><br>As for power Sieglinde has it in spades, she only lacks reach (as far as we know but even then she still have some pretty good mid-range options). And she shits on defenses making her a formidable anti-tank fighter. Her (at the moment) trump card have more destructive force (force =/= scale) than anything in Nanoha's known arsenal. Is faster than a formidable swordmage whose fighstyle is greatly based on speed and have enough knowledge and senses to just stand still and counter what's thrown at her. Kinda like Signum who's slower than Fate but can keep up with her in combat just fine. <br><br>If Sieg really can fly I wish even more for a duel between her and Signum. Two of the best living belkan combatants duking out.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>http://exhentai.org/g/827310/9ac931<wbr>1877/</wbr></br>  <br>Sieg wank is the worst thing to happen to Nanoha threads since crack shipping</br>  <br><br>No people complaining about the franchise not being like their fanfiction is the worst thing to happen to Nanoha.<br><br>Literally autism of the highest caliber.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because it's totally working out great so far.</br>  <br> Escape from the corner I've written the series into <br><br> Vivio gets old enough to go to one of them all girls space Catholic schools with dorms and shit, stick the rest of the Vivid cast there where they can be safe and out of the way <br> Nanoha &amp; Fate and the useful cast members like Hayate &amp; the Wolkenritter and their accessories, and maybe Subaru and Teana, go into space to solve space mysteries and rewrite history <br> seriously, just fucking scuttle all the chaff and give them something new to shoot <br> no bullshit anti-hero tech/magic thing that they have to spend an episode searching Wikipedia on how to beat <br> ignore Force forever, nobody will care if they just pretend it doesn't exist <br><br>It's not hard honestly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> sending Vivio to a different religion's school </br>  <br>I see saints, I call em like I see em.</br>  <br>I really want these two shits erased from existence.</br>  <br>Siegfags are fucking ridicules.</br>  Corona vs Caro.<br>Goliath vs Voltaire.</br>  <br>Corona can't touch Caro</br>  <br>Seconded.</br>  Why couldn't Vivid be like this?<br><br> Sorry for the Fate post. </br></br>  <br>No budget</br>  <br>anus</br>  <br>It's goddamn Nanoha, for fuck's sake. There must be money somewhere.</br>  <br>Why couldn't Vivid be like this?</br>  <br>UFO Nanoha series.<br>I'd wonder how that turn out.</br></br>  <br>The companies producing figurines and printing sleazy artbooks pocketed them.</br>  <br> rhino noses in my Nanoha <br><br>no thanks</br></br></br>  <br> It's goddamn Nanoha, for fuck's sake. There mustn't be actual yuri anywhere. </br>  <br>b/c it's not animated by  ufotable </br>  <br><br>Because it just isn't you autist. Get over it and adapt already.</br></br>  <br><br>You make it sound as if the guy is poor and struggling, which he isn't. I'd say he's been pretty successful overall and none of us have any right to really criticize him in that regard.</br></br>    <br>He made something good 10 years ago and then it didn't go so good after that.</br>  <br>Did Nanoha just go Lightning mode or something at the end there?</br>  <br>Geh, I have trouble telling Suzuka, Fate and Alicia apart with this style. But then I found I just don't give a damn and continue reading, because &gt;characters in Innocent</br>  <br>wait, not Suzuka - Arisa, Fate and Alicia<br>but as said, there is little meaningful characterization going on, so whoever</br></br>  <br>nice thigh gap</br>  So, to pass  the years  time while waiting for Vivid, who is Amita and Kirie's mother that is mentioned in this?  <br>But they don't have a mother.</br>  <br>Wait, I meant this page.</br>    <br>This picture is retarded.</br>  <br>Is this about scale again? It's clearly meant to be a composite shot between the four characters in the foreground and the four in the background.</br>  I've read the manga so I knew what happens but it's still bullshit that Corona lost. She's so much better thane Ein.<br><br>You know, if they just made the eyes a bit smaller then this would've been a lot better. They look fine in the manga but they're way too big in the anime.</br></br>  <br>This is false. Look it how close Rio's mouth is to Corona's breast. She's clearly about to suck them.</br>  I don't understand why Vivio is so intent on being a close range fighter. She's supposed to be naturally better at far range right? She's like a character with ranged carry stats trying to be a front line fighter. It just doesn't work out.  <br>I suppose she is happy to have arms</br>  <br>Because she wants to do it, and it's in her blood.</br>  <br><br>It's wasted potential though. Nanoha needs to put her foot down and help guide her daughter on the correct path.</br></br>  <br>Maybe if she was military trainee, but she's just a kid.</br>  <br> I don't understand why Vivio is so intent on being a close range fighter. <br><br>Because it's more fun you faggot, range is for pussies</br></br></br>  <br>Get kited, nerd.</br>  <br><br>Nanoha was trained at close combat and chose to be a ranged magical fighter as well. <br><br>She's not going to tell her daughter not to do what feels right for her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, look at her BJ and how she fought in StrikerS. She has and uses spells, so I'd say she is factically all-rounded.</br>  <br>Nanoha barely knew much of her family's martial arts at the time she became a magical girl last time I checked.</br>       Einhart Corona.     <br> This is just like my doujins </br>  <br>You mean Corona's doujins.</br>  <br><br> posting no longer existent form of Nanoha and Fate </br></br>  <br> posting no longer existent form of Nanoha and Fate <br>They can use transformation magic and go back to their loli-selves to have hot lesbian loli sex.</br></br>   Corona you kiss better than Vivio.   <br> They can use transformation magic and go back to their loli-selves to have hot lesbian loli sex. <br>They can't and won't.</br></br>  <br>For some reason we still don't have canon age regression</br>  I bet this is what you guys have been keeping this thread alive for:<br><br> [ron] Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha Vivid - 12.5 (recap) [30931C42].mkv <br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>05862<br><br>The episode ends with Corona's seiyuu saying that the BDs/DVDs will have "sharp production." Let me be clear that this means absolutely nothing. She could just mean that the BDs will have a higher video resolution than TVRips just like always. If you take anything away from the statement other than the fact that there will be BDs, then you're reading into it too much.<br><br>There, now I've subbed a full season and released it all in one thread.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> They can't and won't. <br>Next thing you will tell me is that they won't grow magical dicks to spice their relationship either.</br></br>  <br><br>Look, I read that doujin too, but it's just not a thing that really happens.</br></br>  <br>haha, great one.</br>  <br>Thanks!</br>  <br><br>Thanks, bro.<br>Let's say that there's a Season 2/split-cour announcement, would you sub that too?</br></br></br>  <br><br>It doesn't seem like Vivio does anything particularly well. She's like a jack-of-all-trades, but Corona already fills that role and does it better. If she focused on her ranged tactics more she would at least have a niche among the new cast.</br></br>  Are they actually any good?<br><br>http://strawpoll.me/4760876</br></br>  <br>Stop attention whoring aRon.</br>  <br>Dunno.<br><br>They never mentioned her name.<br><br>Jail and Quint are also siblings for some reason.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sort of running out of people. Could be Letti, Mariel, Shario or other StrikerS characters at this point, unless he's going to put an original character there.<br><br>Letti could be fun.</br></br></br>    <br>I want to spank that butt.</br>    <br>Who's Curren Huckebein.</br>  <br>Some shitty fanfiction character.</br>  Fun fact: As of tomorrow, it will have been exactly two years since the last chapter of Force was published.  <br><br>rip in peace</br></br>  <br>Chapter tomorrow confirmed.</br>  <br>You look at the hair. Fate has the light ribbons, Alicia has the dark ones, and Arisa just uses a thin hair tie. This technically doesn't apply while they're "transformed" but those designs are different enough, I assume.<br><br>(Still more work than it should be, but it's something.)</br></br></br>  <br>From the scan I'd think they just say the 'mother' exists and have no intention to introduce any character.</br>  <br>Maybe when Chronicles manga gets finished we'll hear news about FORCE. It was got Yukari Higa busy on first place.</br>    <br>Caro can fly on Friedrich and Corona is literally toast. <br><br>It would be more interesting in hand to hand combat without summons or golems. In that case Corona should win with Nephilim Fist (Unchain Knuckle makes binds inefficient, and the copied moves should be better than anything that Caro can do).</br></br></br>    <br>What does that even mean</br>  <br>It means a korean dies every time they find QUALITY in the animation.</br>  <br>RIP Korea.</br>  <br>Originally a loli</br>  <br>Everybody was "originally" a loli.</br>  <br>No I mean, isn't she doing age progression instead of regression? I don't recall any firm statement either way.</br>  I'm very sad they cut out all the parts with Nanoha and Fate on the sidelines.    EQUALITY AT LAST  <br>They don't really appear until the Miura fight though</br>  <br>Oh yeah, I didn't mean literally on the sidelines. The old cast kind of walks around in the background being moe every so often.</br>  <br><br>That's not a very nice thing to say. They've done nothing wrong anon.<br><br>Vivid haters confirmed for being awful people.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe he just meant Chris and Teo. They're shit-tier devices so I could understand it.</br>  <br>Teo is the best m8 I'll wreck you</br>  <br>Uncensored rock hard loli nipples.</br>  <br> Teo <br> not best <br><br> implying all devices are not the best </br></br></br></br>    <br> They've done nothing wrong anon. <br>They've actively ruined the Nanoha franchise.<br>Not only that, but they're smug about it as well.<br><br>Complete and utter garbage they are.</br></br></br></br></br>     like 5 minutes of the recap dedicated to Corona's fight <br>She really was the staff's waifu</br>  <br>She's Tsuzuki's waifu</br>   base class: summoner <br> not allowed to use her summons <br> "well, fuck it, i'll just go full manaburn nuke" </br></br>  <br>Why isn't she allowed to use her summons, but Corona is?</br>  <br>No shit.</br>  <br>Corona can't use anything that she doesn't make on the field. Summons rely on contracts and she can't just contract something in the middle of the fight.</br>  <br> The cut on Einhart skirt was nowhere to be seen for almost the whole fucking fight <br>What the fuck were they thinking ?</br></br>  <br>She already proved that having the ability to float and dash is enough to overwhelm most of your opponents in that tournament<br>Lulu doesn't need her summons</br></br>  <br>Azumanga reference. At least that way their friendship seem purer like Chiyo and Sakaki's.</br>  <br>What are your surprised about? The staff confirmed to be anything but lolicon countless times.</br>  <br>Unless Corona's panties are involved</br>   Vivid fansub <br> Not fansubbing Vivid <br>How do we fix this?</br></br>  <br>I don't know anon. Corona got plenty of service and focus. Maybe you're just imagining things.</br>  <br><br> plenty of service <br>No, that quality we got isn't fanservice.</br></br></br>  <br>It is. Just not with the budget you would've wished. It's definetely not movie tier but is at least comparable with what the TV series has offered so far.</br>  <br>You might be right, but when I consider the source, I can't see anything but how they ruined the delicious and countless shots.</br>  <br>Seems they aimed for a more accessible series for a wider demographic. That would explain why the service is tamer compared to more hardcore stuff like Prisma Ilya (really, that thing is borderline porn).</br>  <br> (really, that thing is borderline porn). <br>What are you smoking?<br>Even Illya anime is really really tame compared to your average ecchi series.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Also times have change. Fanservice is a dying art <br>The fact that Illya can be consider hardcore is proof of that</br></br></br>  <br> Fanservice is a dying art <br>Of lolis you mean, I hope.<br>Shinmai Maou, DxD, Triage X etc has so much borderline hentai as the most hardcore titles ever had, just with higher quality so they are even more lewd.</br></br></br>  <br>Haven't even watched the series but almost any clip of it is excessively abused in terms of service. Specially those with brown Player 2 Ilya. Little girls shouldn't do that stuff, it's very alienating. That's why I passed that series.</br>  <br>They are still extremely tame compared to any ecchi. There is one high quality scene with her, and that is the kiss scene I'm sure you've seen many times, but aside from it there weren't many lewd shots, there weren't cameltoes, and noodle quality happened.<br>All in all it is pretty lewd for a SoL or action series, but tame for an ecchi.</br></br>  <br>You are fooling yourself<br>Animation quality has improved a lot but service shots and ecchi anime has been in decline since the past decade, both in quality and quantity.<br>Of course they still exist if you buy the BDs but I want you to think in all the fanservice of the 90s and early 00s and compare it with the state of the industry today</br></br></br>  <br>There are more than one heavy ecchi titles each season.<br>I don't think it's in decline, aside from more being censored for TV broadcast. The only ecchi that's hardly existent is loli, and it always hurts to see a lolicon source being adapted with removed lolicon.</br></br>  <br>But there used to be far more and with more service shots. Nowadays pantishots are a rare event only common in a few shows and as you say usually censored. In the past they were everywhere, even in kids anime.<br>And I am not talking only about lolis</br></br>  <br>Maybe you're right, I just don't notice it because the decline is nothing compared to the annihilation that loli service went through.</br>  <br>Yeah I think that's the problem. ViVid is not an ecchi series while you want it to be one. The manga took some liberties with the format but the anime focused on whats important for what they want to do, Nanoha TV anime had always been pretty tame in terms of fanservice. In that sense ViVid doesn't show much difference with past seasons. You can always go back to the manga.</br>  <br>The problem is that Nanoha always had multiple appeal; for example first series had at least cute SoL moments alongside action.<br>In Vivid, all they ever talk about is fighting and more fighting, so that appeal died. It had some great fanservice to cover up for it, but with its removal, the anime just removed any appeal outside fighting/action fans' taste.</br></br>  Stop feeding the troll.<br><br>It's a dead giveaway when he uses "quality" and "fanservice" in the same sentence.</br></br>  <br>One day no one will get that reference.</br>  <br>Nanoha threads attract people who just can't stop responding to bait, unfortunately.</br>  <br>That day will be the death of /a/</br>  Place your bets. What comes next? Movie 3rd or Vivid 2nd season?<br><br>I think they could both end up being a year or more away since we still have no info on either. Plus we'll have to wait nearly a year for 3rd to come out on BD.</br></br>  <br>Movie 3rd end of this year, BDs next year. Vivid announcement at either one of these probably</br>  Where are these from, official twotter?  Please post any I don't have.

Who will it be?</br></br>  I already like it better than Vitalization, but I will have to wait for the OP visuals to see if it dethrones Synchrogazer.  <br>Hopefully Maria and Tsubasa. I really hope they both die this season.</br>  <br>Fuck you faggot.<br>No one is allowed to die.</br></br>  <br>It's okay. Doesn't really seem special or anything.

At least then they'd have a competent editor.</br></br></br>  <br>Zoid is actually competent with Japanese.

He's good.<br><br>The only mouth breathers who think Commie is good are the idiots who think that "If you're not localizing the shit out of everything you're not actually translating!" whereas Zoid is translating with his actual audience in mind, knowing that the people who watch Symphogear are weebs who've read up on the lore and don't need everything watered down and filtered for them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He has also said that he'll use honorifics, leave cultural references in tact <br><br>Oh boy, will he also use TL notes? <br>I'm glad he'll do this, but it's hilarious how you can actually praise such stupidity.</br></br></br></br>  <br> wanting memesubs and the shitty following that comes with it in these threads </br>  <br> implying Commie didn't seriously mess up a lot of the translations and enjoyed holding back subs just to make us wait. <br><br>I have more trust in Zoid for giving an honest effort when it comes to translation. The typesetting though is a different story going from the PV...</br></br></br>  <br>Competent in Japanese doesn't mean competent in English.<br><br>And I know Zoid, I've been following him since he started translating the manga. Though I don't quite agree with him on most point and think that he definitely needs a good editor (like most TLs) I think he's okay for this.<br><br><br>Because S1 threads were fucking a load of shitposting and a shipping bonanza like these threads are nowadays right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but it's hilarious how you can actually praise such stupidity. <br> TL notes <br> bad <br>Open a fucking book you moron. <br>http://www.shakespearedefined.com/<br><br>If you think "real" translators localize shit the same way Commie does, you're out of your fucking mind.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The guy already said he'd fix the spacing to the bottom and not use bright colors next time.</br>  There's a good chance Funi will pick up S3 either way.  <br>They said they wouldn't, but added that if they have the time they might make separate sub tracks for that kind of thing, among other ideas.</br>  <br>And I will kill myself if that happens</br>  <br> He has also said that he'll use honorifics, leave cultural references in tact <br> This is a bad thing? <br>How would you prefer they do it?

A lover of reverse NTR?<br>Does she get more pleasure out of watching her partner subdue and breed another bitch, or is she just doing the harem thing to make Rito happy?<br>She strikes me as the type of girl that would hold another girl down in an optimal mating position to make sure she gets pregnant.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Behold my shit taste</br>  <br>oh the cancer<br><br> Run top tier, kill me <br><br>Momo not at least S, go fuck yourself<br><br>Risa not the same as ecchi yami, KILL yourself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There have been several times where Momo started the harem plan so she can be noticed and loved by Rito and also making the other girls who are attracted to him also happy. Even Rito, THE DENSEST MATERIAL KNOWN TO MAN had caught on to her motive for the harem plan. (possibly)<br><br>To answer your other questions, as far as I know Momo has one sexual preference: Rito- No, then there's the thing with her sister and Rito's gender-bent counter part Riko... Lesbian/Rito? I don't know. But if the harem plan goes through, then Rito's being faithful to everyone in his harem, so there's no "cucking or ntr'ing" per say. As far as I can tell, as long as Momo is apart of the action, or watches then she's satisfied.</br></br></br>  <br>Momo best wingman/wife</br>  <br>So Momo would still hold Mikan down so Rito can properly impregnate her, as long as she gets impregnated that night as well?</br>  Okay, /a/. If To Love-Ru Darkness was a full blown balls to the soft walls of a woman's pelvis hentai (as if it almost wasn't anyway). Who would've Rito already slept with if he was just a little bit more serious in some of his mega intimate moments? Because the first two that popped up into my head were Risa, Yui. (He could have given Risa and Yui the D SO HARD, THEIR BODIES AND MINDS WERE READY). Why I didn't say Momo is because the same chapter where Rito caught on to Momo's motives, was the same one where she realized her body was not truly ready.<br><br><br>I wouldn't put it past her if she did.</br></br></br>  <br> Momo would still hold Mikan down so Rito can properly impregnate her <br><br>This is the route everybody</br></br></br>  <br>But Mikan is still a middle schooler.<br><br>Her body wasn't meant to withstand forceful and constant pumping movements into her womb, those would break her...</br></br></br>  <br>*still a grade schooler<br>But she would take it if it was her Onii-chan~<br>Knowing Rito he would be gentle with her, or he would wait until she's older. Or other things that don't involve penetrating her with his beast.</br></br></br>   not corrupting the tsundere into cock-hungry slut   You guys can have the other girls. I just want Nana.  <br> Nobody has dumped some Mikan doujins <br> Nor any other To Love Ru girl <br>Urusanai.</br></br></br>  <br>Dude, it's To Love-Ru Darkness, do we really need to dump doujins?</br>  <br>she would take it<br>and she would love it<br>because deep down inside her long repressed sexual desire for her brother are surfacing<br><br> I noticed this in the later CH of the darkness manga </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He didn't catch onto it, she had to tell him directly what she was planning.</br>  <br>Meant to link </br>  <br>I meat new ones, sharing what we discover in these filthy holes is always a good thing for us.</br>  <br><br>No, no, no. Yes, she told him about the Harem Plan. But he didn't figure out her real motive for it until that chapter, which I didn't realize until I reread that chapter months later after I read it when it first came out.</br></br>  <br><br>I'd love to see a doujin of Nemesis and Momo having a competition to see who can give Rito the better orgasm.</br></br>  <br><br>Momo is the only character that does things and changes throughout the series. Sure Yui and Run can "do things" to your dick but other than that they serve no purpose, Momo is the only character really advancing what little plot TLR has.<br><br>inb4 we get too serious about character archetypes, development, and plot in a fucking harem manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Darkness is basically her and Yami's story</br>  <br>Why are you dumbasses arguing about dick holes. cause that's what this manga is full of. There's no plot at all, it's just "a day in the life of the world's most virgin guy around so many sexy ovalating, ready to fuck hot babes" I'd fuck them all equally. I have no taste. i want them all. Only a dumbass would try and classify these beautiful gems.<br><br>I hope yabuki get's paid well and sleeps at night well knowing millions jack off to his ideas.</br></br></br>  <br>Rito pls</br>  Having a harem seems good on paper but then you're stuck spending all of your time hanging out with 20 different girls and raising about 50 children. <br><br>You'd need some sort of eternal aphrodisiac and spend 30 minutes fucking each one a day and still that wouldn't be enough for them.</br></br>  <br>I can do that. I have lots of energy and I can make loving them a full time job. I can be the stay at home dad.</br>   http://www.at-x.com/program/detail<wbr>/6532</wbr> <br>No parental guidance mentioned on AT-X. I guess it will air censored.</br>  <br> I already went deep, I can only go down further. <br>Momo isn't the only one who has had development in the series. Some of the characters have changed here and there. Run showed she wasn't a complete bitch, Yui has laxed on her uppity morals committee and even became bold enough to offer Rito the D. Even Rito has changed a bit. He's become slightly, slightly less embarrassed and shy with other girls. He maintained good composure until the end during that side story where Nana and Momo switched bodies and noticed that even girls like Nana can be sexy (Delicious Pettanko-Tsundere). Lala hasn't changed much per say, but Darkness has shown she's not completely naive or as oblivious as she was in To Love-Ru. Of course the ones who have had the most development are Momo and Yami of course.</br></br>  <br>Not when YOU'RE KING OF THE MOTHAFUCKIN' GALAXY! With the top medical scientists (Tear and Mikado) with an expert botanist (Momo), they can help Rito perfectly tend to his own private garden of girls.</br>  <br><br>I know where you are coming from and I wish I could see TLR as plainly as you. Unfortunately I took a lot of literature and film analysis courses in college so it's impossible to not pick apart the plot and characters.<br><br>That being said, all the girls still give me a raging boner.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good to see I'm not alone in this boat. For a romantic (is there enough romance to classify it as such?) ecchi-comedy, I look into it a bit too much. As DouchebagChocolat said it doesn't really go beyond just being porn really. Maybe I look into it too deep because I'm trying to find reasons to keep reading it and lying to myself that there's something more to it than just porn so it's not a guilty pleasure. I've seen several instances of good porn with good plot, but To Love-Ru Darkness is not that. It maybe because Yabuki Kentaro's art style is just amazing, the characters that appeal to me, hilarious antics, or playing "where did Yabuki-sensei hide the vagina this month?". But I do find solace in a quote from Grand Budapest Hotel, "Times have changed, I love it all just the same, this enchanted old ruin." My tastes may have been refined, but I found To Love-Ru before they were. Even then, every month I hope that perhaps there will be a little bit less fan service and more plot. Perhaps the other girls will begin to make their advances on Rito, and he'll realize how many of them love him. Perhaps Nemesis' master plan will finally come into play and bringing plot to the manga again...

That's why I go after other people's sisters.</br>    <br>I'm fairly certain if Rito wasn't as shy he would have banged a few of the girls by now, probably Risa, Mea, Yui, Momo being the last because her body was not ready until recently, or maybe she still isn't.</br>  <br>Her Doujins will forever be canon in my heart.</br>  <br>Momo is shit but Mikan is fine.<br><br>The true best girls of TLR are Mikan, Yami and Nana.</br></br></br>  <br>This nigga knows what's up</br>  <br> probably Risa <br>But Risa's not into dudes, she just wants someone like Rito.</br></br>  <br>They really are anon, they really are.<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127300317 <br>One can hope, she is the best girl for harem.

Entertained while they wait for their turn with him.</br></br></br>  <br>My dick became rock hard when Mikan got hypnotised to attack Yami and Rito.<br><br>She even managed to squeeze her brother head with her legs, and press her pussy into his face.</br></br></br>  <br>They're the best honestly. I hope there will be a third one still. <br><br>Risa is all around best girl for fun.</br></br></br>  What do I need to do to get a girl like that?  <br>You need to be extremely handsome.</br>  Kyouko!  <br><br>It makes me content that you sick bastards will never be able to touch a real woman.</br></br>  <br>Oh I did but that has no room in this thread.</br>  <br>TOSHINO</br>  <br>What outfit is that? Are they in a church choir or something? That is one slutty churchgoer.</br>  <br> But Risa's not into dudes, she just wants someone like Rito. <br>She WANTS Rito. She was ready to receive his D in one chapter in To Love-Ru, which Motto To Love-Ru also covered and made an extra scene where she sighed and it had a hint of disappointment which hinted towards her wanting to actually do it with him. Furthermore exhibit A in this post. (which coincidently enough, is from the same chapter you posted, how did you miss this?)<br><br>She's clearly into men as well as women, but doesn't have shit taste.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>EXHIBIT B!<br> What kind of men do you prefer? <br> Someone like Yuuki I guess. <br>I think it's abundantly clear Risa is bi, that or like Momo she's a lesbian/Rito-sexual.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>bottom-left = looks<br>top-right = intelligence<br>top-left = the luck factor<br>bottom-left = kindness (not sure)<br><br>I have forgotten what the top one was<br><br><br>She's an idol, they are practicing a song.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're blind. Risa wants Riko, she just hasn't met her yet.</br></br>  <br>Everyone wants Riko, even Steve wants Riko and all he says is "Heyo."</br>  <br> bottom-left = kindness <br>bottom-right, I meant.</br></br>  <br><br>FURTHER MORE RIKO X RISA DOUJIN! IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN!</br></br>  <br><br>She sees right through Momo and simply trolls her.<br><br>and the sighing scene you mentioned, I always understood that as giggling. Too bad we didn't see her face</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Eat shit, Momo isn't about exclusivity</br></br>  <br><br>How does it feel to have a girl sleep on your arm, anon? Doesn't it cut off the blood supply?</br></br>  <br> hug a bag of potatoes when going to sleep <br> ??? <br> profit <br>Report back to us how it went.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Risa seeing through Momo's question? Or Momo's veil of innocence? Probably both. But considering Risa's reaction at the end of the side story was this, something tells me Risa answered Momo's question honestly.</br>  <br><br>Wow, is that what risa wants from a potentian boyfriend?<br><br>Do you have the same stats for Haruna?</br></br></br></br>   SLUT   <br> implying that Risa wants the D at all </br>  <br> But still, that momo-chii. Che had such a cut reaction, just like *a certain someone* <br> While licking her lips like some kind of succubus. <br> Implying that she likes to tease a lot. <br>And Rito has been teased by her several times especially back in To Love-Ru. If it has legs, and is a woman, or Rito. She' gonna want it, or tease it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> But still that momo-chii. She had such a cute reaction, just like a *certain someone* <br>I should really check my spelling before posting.</br></br></br>  <br>Is that what people wears to church these?</br>  <br> If it has legs, and is a woman, or Rito. She' gonna want it, or tease it. <br>Alternatively, is a woman AND Rito.</br></br>  <br><br>Looks great at first but then things can get really awkward. You will both do it once then realize a pillow is far superior to your arm.</br></br>  <br>That works too.</br>  <br><br>And also the chapter where Risa takes Rito on a date in To Love-Ru is still one of my favorite.</br></br>  <br>Are there more like that one for the other girls?</br>  Someone have the full Keikaku Guide Book Trouble Mania scan ?  <br>This.<br><br>I would be really interested in what type of stats Haruna's ideal is.</br></br></br>  Haruna-chan is my waifu.    <br>Hair ruins immersion</br>  <br>I don't even remember what was her friend's name.<br>I feel bad.</br></br>  <br>She's not upside down, the angle of the camera changes the overall perspective you rere</br>  <br>Saki and Mio.</br>  <br>Nice trips, but who?</br>  <br>Risa and Mio, fuck.</br>  Why hasn't King Deviluke took Rito under his wing and start training him to become the next Leader?<br><br>Literally everyone is down for Rito Ruling the Universe. I think that could add for some actual plot, along with more hotter alien babes who would love rito. Hell maybe do a genderbender where King Deviluke turns female and rito has to help him change back.<br><br>Just food for thought.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe he wants to breed with all those delicious teens himself.</br>    <br>Because the betrothal is on hold. Also he doesn't think much of Rito. Maybe how wife will help him come around.</br>  <br>Your dick would die</br>    <br>Is there one for Yami?</br>  <br>Lala and Momo too high.

It's an honest enough ranking.</br>    <br>Below Run is too low.</br>  How did you all like the gender bender arc?  Worst arc ever  The ending was awful.  Yeah ending sucked but everything up to it was good  <br><br>Nice work samefag.</br></br>  Does /a/ like NTR?  I like everything as long as the art is good.  I love it for a variety of reasons... in theory.<br><br>In practice almost no one has the balls to make a proper NTR that actually builds emotional investment in the reader by starting as vanilla.<br><br>But man, considering how popular it seems to be, it's really weird that more haremshit eromanga don't have at least one heroine NTRed away from the protagonist.</br></br></br></br>  I like anything as long as the boys are good.  I like everything as long as the cocks are detailed and there's plenty of cross-section images and hefty amounts of semen.  I wouldn't mind if it weren't for the disgusting fat hairy old men.  Most NTR dumbs down the characters too much for me to rage. But yes, I do enjoy some NTR once in a while.  Absolutely patrician taste.  I don't care much about NTR, if it's hot I'll fap to it and that's it.<br><br>I like humiliation, and since most NTR are tied to the girl being degraded it's boner fuel, but I don't care about cheating or all that stuff,  I always selfinsert as the girl .</br></br>  Generally yes.  <br> In practice almost no one has the balls to make a proper NTR that actually builds emotional investment in the reader by starting as vanilla. <br>Look at this anon talking out of his ass.<br><br>You should read more of Seme Danjous stuff.</br></br></br></br>  Depends on the scenario. Most are just pure shit.  <br>I wish I could read moonrune anon. But then again most of seme's works arent scanned  at least on panda </br>  I like cheating when it's about women becoming slaves to the D, but NTR is designed around humiliating the male, and that's just a complete turn off.<br><br>It doesn't help that NTR is bottom of the barrel in terms of writing. It's hilariously bad even by hentai standards.</br></br>  NTR and cheating are the only things I fap to, so I suppose so.<br><br>I just get off much easier when I see women, especially milfs with children, being sluts and cheating, fucking other guys while wearing wedding bands and things. Even better if the husband ISN'T on a perpetual business trip and she still acts all lovey dovey with him. NTR impregnation and the woman passing it off as her husband's child is the most satisfying ending to an NTR story for me, especially if it also includes pregnant sex. <br><br>That being said, pregnant sex where it is the husband's child but a stranger is fucking her while she's carrying is THE ultimate turn on for me. Sure, the husband technically wins since it is in fact his child, but part of me thinks "When that child is born, their mother will have had sex with a man that isn't their father while heavily pregnant behind their father's back, what a slut" and other things like that, which further fuels my boner.<br><br>What's also good is when a milf goes into love hotels with another guy, but that doesn't really happen as often as I'd like. It happened in that one film, Colorful, which got me hard as fuck.<br><br>A few of my favourites are (I don't know if panda links are allowed outside panda threads)<br>http://exhentai.org/g/753523/5c197a<wbr>b7a8/ (just the first parts)<br>http://exhentai.org/g/785414/5318e1<wbr>4775/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/824191/bb6874<wbr>cf72/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/717541/d6452b<wbr>4182/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/431968/0a4595<wbr>4112/ (the entire series is nice)<br>There are too many to links to post for this but the Ane/Kaya-nee series from Kon-Kit<br>A lot of Aoi Hitori's works<br>http://exhentai.org/g/623373/20e153<wbr>c8e5/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/800587/466688<wbr>daa7/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/777058/5fd155<wbr>af84/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/798801/b2b450<wbr>2225/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/822389/56308c<wbr>70fb/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/824799/fece8e<wbr>37ae/<br>Most Takasugi Kou works (helps that I have somehwat of an oedipus complex)<br>Netoraserare is quite good in my opinion too</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Character limit reached, but my obsession with cheating and NTR has gotten to the point that I can't help but see it in nearly every anime I watch these days. Whenever there's a mother that's going out, or the MC leaves the house and his mother's alone I can't help but think "It'd be so hot if she calls over her fuckbuddy and has messy, sloppy sex while he's out", and I always automatically assume, and hope for, a twist where the MC finds out his wife/his mother/girlfriend is cheating. NTR and cheating has taken hold of my life and I can't stop fapping.</br>  Hana hook has some good stuffs. Too bad he seems to write repeatative shit.  <br>I feel the exact same thing, except I hate NTR.</br>  <br>Tachibana was my first experience with NTR. Shit hit me hard, but in retrospect I was lucky the art was fantastic.</br>  <br> I was lucky <br> the art was fantastic <br>we are entitled to an opinion /a/non</br></br></br>   le cuck meme XDDD <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>Yes because I'm not a fucking retard who can't self insert into the dirty old man.</br>  <br> he </br>  <br> not self-inserting as the girl <br>What are you even doing on /a/.</br></br>  Just simply get bored with vanilla. I am not necessary looking for ntr but I like to know that main girl is being fucked by other guys to wether it's controversal or not.  It's rare but I dig bestiality/monster NTR.  <br>I just self-insert as the ghost in the ceiling, masturbating as events unfold</br>  <br>Anon, porn is created to make us emphatize with the girl.</br>  cucks are the worst, fuck ntr  <br>My fellow voyeur.</br>  I can't go through a single game,story, anime or movie were the mc's love interest gets kidnapped without assuming she's being raped and mind broken its come to the point were i just ignore the story plot hopefully it will get better... one day  Sometimes.<br>If the boy is a pussy and just watches everything happen without doing shit, then no<br>Or anything that involves fat old man.<br>My favorite but most rare is NTR when the cuck deserves it, it's so sweet.</br></br></br>   Tags <br> male: Blackmail, Rape, Incest, Netorare <br> Female: Femdom, Impregnation, Sister, Yandere <br><br>I hate myself for enjoying this one, I'm such a hypocrite.</br></br></br></br>  NTR in porn is fine, but NTR in actual anime and manga makes my blood BOIL.  <br> not being a cuck <br> 2014 <br><br>lol, look at this plebe.</br></br></br></br>  I hate that NTR has good art most of the time, so fapping is a must even though I dislike it  <br>Seriously, I love Rocket Monkey's artstyle, but it's all NTR<br>Like, I don't mind it, but get some variety already</br></br>  Interracial sex between big black men and tight white woman is so fucking hot for this reason.<br><br>You have the beautiful, high-class, blonde-haired blue-eyed white woman.

His nappy negro black hair, black eyes, and dark black skin combine with his inherently low intelligence and large build to give us a fucking animal...<br><br>When the negro and the white woman meet... When the beast acts on his primal urge and takes our elegant beauty's humanity away with rape... When that animal's big, slinky black cock forces its way in and out of that tight, previously pure white pussy over and over, utterly defiling her, conquering her, and claiming her as his... When that fucking Nigger sows his seed in her fertile white womb as she pleads with him not to, forcing her the utmost humiliation of raising a half-breed fucking animal beast like himself...<br><br><br>Is there truly ANYTHING hotter than that?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yes<br> Having sex with a girl in the missionary position with the lights of for the sole purpose to reproduction </br>    <br>As a black man I have to ask:<br>Why does it always have to be about race with you whites?</br></br>  <br>Yes.<br>All that but with pigmen.</br></br>  <br>That faggot may prefer niggers, but I prefer huge fucking humanoid animals. <br>There's nothing hotter than seeing that stomach bulge.</br></br>  Not until I started self-inserting as the girl.  <br>Taking a break from shitposting on /pol/, Chaim?</br>  <br>It's good, there's nothing to be ashamed.</br>  <br>This is fucking amazing, thank you.</br>  <br>Because blacks are inhuman to them.<br>Imagine if you replaced that 'black man' with a 6 back alpha gangster male.

Anyway, it was about some guy whose wife had a slut sister who wanted to fuck him, so she blackmailed the wife into getting fucked by some boyfriend while she tricked the husband into fucking her by posing as the wife. And then of course the wife ends up mindbroken and the bitch sister ends up pregnant, and the husband comes home every day to see his wife get fucked by the boyfriend in their apartment.</br>  <br> furry tier <br>Its way lower than furry to me.

There was this NTR anime where this kid was bullied at school by some douchebag, the mother fucked the guy in return he would stop bullying her son.<br><br>In the end she succumbed to his dick and became his cumbucket, she left her son alone at home and became a public toilet and was never seen again aside on the internet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That's stupid. <br>People who are into that sort of thing use the difference in skin colour as an easy way to represent 'othering'<br>white is 'us', black is 'other.<br>The girl is white, so she's 'mine'<br>The man is black, so he's 'other'<br>The 'other' is taking whats mine for himself and I'm powerless to stop it. What's more, the 'other' is a pornstar, well-built and attractive with a big dick, and "I'm" just an average guy, the difference in desirability and masculinity is clear and divided along that coloured line of self vs other.<br><br>What they really want is for things to be taken from them by someone else, and for that loss to be a narrative of 'losing out' to a stronger or more desirable male. Porn provides plenty of men bigger and stronger and more attractive that your average cuck, but if they're not different enough, they don't get the feeling that it's "other". Colour is an easy way of making someone seem different and alien from you.<br><br>Actual cuckolding porn is rare, so most just project their fantasy narrative onto anything remotely compatible. Interracial is ripe for it because people insecure about their masculinity, like masochist male-subs tend to be, are also insecure about their race and goddamn everything else.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  http://exhentai.org/g/818738/957037<wbr>77cc/</wbr>  <br> that's disgusting too <br>Your racism is showing.</br></br>  <br> A slut getting NTR'd doesn't have the same impact. <br>Seems like someone didn't read Chains of Lust or Kuros Aphrodisiac/Counterattack</br></br>  <br> Interracial is ripe for it because people insecure about their masculinity <br>Could be, but Ive also read about theories on how it could be an STD, as that kind of behavior would have been selected out due to evolution.</br></br>    <br>Dont be an idiot, faggot cuck.

It also doesn't help that they tend to share the bitch, I wouldn't ever share that pussy, at least not at the same time since that would make me gay.  Let's brighten up this thread a little.<br>It's dreary. <br><br>Who makes the best vanilla ahegao and why is Fukuyama Naoto?</br></br></br>  <br>Don't even try anon, this thread is now a bastion of /sp/.</br>  <br>I say they are the best.

Netorare and Netori <br><br>Netorare: A sexual fetish designed to cause sexual jealousy by way of having the heroine indulge in sexual activity with someone other as the protagonist (Usually the player character)<br><br>For a game/manga/anime to be classified as Netorare the following conditions must be met:<br>1. The heroine either must be romantically involved with the protagonist, a potential romance for him or of someone that the protagonist shares such a close relationship (sister, mother, childhood friend etc.) that jealousy is a factor.<br><br>2. Related sexual events are explicitly shown to the player or later described in detail.<br><br>There 3 types of Netorare:<br><br>Type A: The heroine is willingly cheating on the protagonist with another guy and enjoys every second of it. No rape, blackmail, drugs etc. involved, it's consensual sex from the very beginning.<br><br>Type B: Initially, the heroine is raped, blackmailed, drugged or otherwise tricked to have sex with someone other than the protagonist. However, she eventually starts enjoying it and the sex becomes fully consensual in the end.<br><br>Type C: The heroine is raped in front of the protagonist and he can only helplessly watch it. It's non-consensual from start to finish.<br><br>Netori: Netori are games/manga/anime where the protagonist steals the lover or wife/husband of someone else.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> /v/ <br>Get out.<br><br>And I meant *hentai tags, imbecile.</br></br></br></br>  <br> bitches who give in to NTR are categorically terrible <br>but you are wrong anon</br></br>  <br>Incorrect. Your definition for netorare implies you can't have it have a woman being netorared by her boyfriend.</br>  <br>And it's pretty obvious where the cuckspammer's coming from.</br>  <br>well it's true though woman can't get NTR'd, she simply becomes a member of a harem.</br>  <br> You will never experience the feeling of a huge orc taking you for his wife, and being so damn manly with you that you can't help but fall in love and want to have his children </br>  <br>just you ignorance. we NTRfags love to steal bitches</br>  <br>Speak for yourself, I just want to feel the pleasure of being filled with oversized dicks in every hole.</br>  <br>vanillafags have no skin at all</br>  <br>all im getting is a picture of a panda</br>  <br> well it's true though woman can't get NTR'd, she simply becomes a member of a harem. <br><br>Untrue.<br>You have no idea what you're talking about.</br></br></br></br>  <br> we NTRfags love to steal bitches </br>  <br>Sure thing, cuck.<br>At least own up to being a cuckold.</br></br>  <br>you can't deflect it anon</br>  <br>No, I'm right.

Nothing gets accomplished in these threads, they just devolve into endless shitposting.  <br>I forgot how much I like pish.</br>   tfw you didn't check the tags beforehand <br> get invested <br> develop a new fetish after edging over 50 pages of dialog </br></br>   Is it possible for a game to be a Netori game and a Netorare game at the same time? <br><br>Yes, it's possible. This game here, is an example. In this case, a Type B Netorare and Netori at the same time.<br><br>You can focus on stealing the black wife from your neighbour, or you can have your wife stolen from you.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sadpanda threads <br> No one gives a shit <br> People post what they want to post <br>Only outside panda threads devolves NTR in a shitfest.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Eww.</br>  <br> deep </br>  <br>I bet this isn't translated right?

But really good game all around.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I like it when the girls are slutty.<br><br>NTR is good for that, so yes.</br></br>  <br>What about a netori where a dickgirl steals the boyfriend from the protagonist and turns him into a trap by raping him constantly, making him uncapable of living as a man anymore.</br>  <br> Everyone's After Her <br>So Trianglue Blue, 2014 version?</br></br>  <br>angry landwhale detected; there's no series like that</br>  <br>NTR is actually fucking shit for that. If you actually like full blown sluts you don't read NTR.<br><br>If you do then you clearly don't know what a true slut is.

Where "the player" is the girl, essentially.<br><br>Exceptional bonus points if said girl has huge tits like that pic.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You got me. It's not like I'm really interested anyways, I already got my fill with that one where the sister fucks her brother while he's on the phone with his gf. So good.</br>  <br>She's a slut, but a bashful slut until she mindbreaks.<br><br>On the slut scale she's somewhere in the middle.</br></br></br>  What's the most impactful NTR setting?  <br><br>Usually when is not the girlfriend of the protagonist. When it's a female member of his circle, usually his mother, or his younger sister or his childhood friend.</br></br>  <br>that is one fucked up story NTR is the least of their problems</br>  <br> in the middle <br>What is a 10?</br></br>  <br>The one that starts vanilla for a couple of chapters. Only works on new artists though that didn't build up a reputation.<br><br>No one would get baited by Tanaka Aji or Carn anymore because of their reputation despite Carn having done some good vanilla before.</br></br></br>  <br>Personal opinion which would equal universal truth inbound.<br><br>Childhood friend getting stolen and rammed until all her bodily fluids evaporate, with the protagonist forced to watch cum gushing out of her, bonus points for raising a kid that's not his. <br><br>Keyword is childhood friend, I feel nothing for normal girls that met the MC a few months ago, but a childhood friend can get me somewhat angry depends on the presentation.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/800847/f48fe7<wbr>30d0/</wbr></br>  <br>so OtomiDori. I'm not even into NTR but that one gets my motor going for some reason.</br>  <br>Really? I didn't like Otome at all so her NTR did nothing for me. MC's sister got a bigger reaction out of me and for the first time I wanted to self-insert as the Old Man fucking Rinka.<br><br>I felt "NTR'd" because the old guy wasn't allowed to come inside her.</br></br></br>  <br> you will never be a genuine full on gal slut </br>  <br>So this is the power of sluts, eh? Not bad.</br>  <br>family NTR</br>  <br>I think it's the part about her being pregnant while getting fucked hard to the point where the guy penetrates her womb.</br>  <br> that muscle girl <br> that pregnant bitch <br>Holy shit</br></br></br>  <br>this series needs more translations.</br>  <br>A childhood friend is practically family at that point so it's more impactful than some random slut.</br>  <br>But each fell in love with their respective new guy, once that happens it can't be called NTR anymore</br>  <br> you will never find the secret entrance to the legendary Slut City </br>  <br>How about NTR where the victim realizes he's gay afterwards, forms a loving, successful relationship with another man, and lives happily ever after?</br>   ITT <br>cucks</br>  <br> But each fell in love with their respective new guy <br>I know niggers on crack that make more sense than you.</br></br>  <br> But each girl fell in love with their respective new guy <br>happy now?</br></br>  <br>They didn't, that's the thing.<br><br>Not even in the LN.</br></br></br>  <br>I fucking love NTR.</br>  <br>cuck</br>  <br> They didn't <br>lel, explain their behavior in the room orgy then.<br>And not only the girls, the guys as well</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sure. <br><br>I believe in my girlfriend (俺は彼女を信じてる)<br><br>Kensuke and Ayumu have known each other since childhood. It wasn’t until recently that they realized that they had feelings for each other that were much more than friends. While working in a PC Software company as a salesman, Kensuke is told to work at another branch due to a shortage of manpower. The big catch here is that he won’t be able to live at his apartment anymore so that he can easily commute to his new job.<br><br>That being said, he won’t be able to see Ayumu for a very long time, but she’s been sweet enough to watch over his apartment while he’s gone. Well, you know what they say about long distance relationships; after a good amount of time has passed, Kensuke is in a mixture of loneliness and paranoia. He’s missing Ayumu, but also doubting why a woman like her would stick around for a guy like him. To add more confusion to the fire he’s come across four women around his new work that give him more temptation that he can bare.<br><br>Will our hero hold out for love, or will he give into the pressures?<br><br><br>OK Type A Netorare, Protagonist has to move to another city because of work reasons. So he and his girlfriend begins a long distance relationship, where BOTH sides can cheat each other with different people (Males on her side, females on his side). <br><br>You begin following the MC (Male) shoes, as he moves to another city, then it changes the perspective to his girlfriend. You need to do decisions on both sides to progress. <br><br>A happy ending is achieved when both don't cheat with anyone, make frequent contact with each other by phone calls and always go see each other on holidays</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your entire world must be fucking screwed if you interpret that as "falling in love". Holy shit anon, you are actually trying to fun of me right now aren't you:?</br>  I love it when the girl who obviously loves the guy starts getting gangbanged for the sake of the above mentioned guy with a sloppy but happy smile on her face. <br><br>Even if the blackmail plot is utter retarded there's still something primal and exciting about a girl getting corrupted like that, howling as big, fat and juicy cocks pummel her uterus.</br></br>  <br> No one would get baited by Tanaka Aji or Carn anymore <br><br>I'm sure there are those that still gets baited by Carn. Just look at the "ITT Post happy families" threads and they put Otomedori ending in there and people asking for sauce</br></br></br>  I like NTR, but not to masturbate, and never when it involves faceless fat men or macho black guys.<br><br>But when a girl gets stolen away from one guy to another guy with proper emotional build up and none of that "His dick is hitting my womb! Takumi-kun could never reach that far in!" I think it really makes for great stories.<br><br>That being said. NTR will never be taken seriously because the people who like it are scum among scum.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Ops, i think this is not translated, NVM then. I dunno, go look around.</br></br></br>  <br> But when a girl gets stolen away from one guy to another guy with proper emotional build up and none of that "His dick is hitting my womb! Takumi-kun could never reach that far in!" I think it really makes for great stories. <br>Got any examples for such stories?</br></br>  <br>No, I just read it last night.<br><br>They surrendered way more than their bodies, and the guys as well didn't cared about their old video recording practices anymore. Just feeling good with each other.</br></br></br>  <br>Interpreting that as falling in love is stupid. They just went with the flow and wanted a good dicking, nothing more. They broke off all contact with them.</br>  <br>The only people who hate NTR are beta virgins. See ITT betas calling it shit taste.<br>Everyone else loves it for schadenfreude or voyeurism.</br></br>  <br>They didn't broke contact at all.<br>Orgy was 6 months later and pregnancy 1 year later. <br>They meet once per week at least, are we reading the same thing?</br></br></br>  You do know that reaching too deep with a dick inside a real woman hurts like hell right? You know women don't cum immediately when you stick it in them? You know there's no stupid ahegao, right? You know no actual woman screams "YOU'RE HITTING MY WOMB! MY HIPS ARE MOVING ON THEIR OWN!1!!!" ? You know there's no actual woman that turns into a retard when she sees a dick right?

Whenever there's a girl that could be romantically or sexually interested in the MC, I can't help but think "It'd be so hot if she seduces him, or he seduces her and they have messy, sloppy, loving sex.", and I always automatically assume, and hope for, a twist where the MC finds out about his female friends feelings and goes beyond hand holding and kissing.

Anything non lewd is fine.<br><br>Have a good week, everyone.</br></br>  <br>Oh hey, did you manage to see my fig about two threads ago? It's pretty nice, I think you'd like the design if you didn't see it before. The finger's a little wonky, but I think it was due to the packaging.</br>  Requesting my husbando Kuranosuke Koibuchi, perhaps acting romantic and/or saying " I love you."<br><br>Have a good weekend.</br></br>  <br> 8681x4092 <br>what the shit</br></br>  <br>easier to colour that way, no?</br>  Requesting a sweaty Esdese eating an ice cream popsicle, the ones with gumball eyes, if herself or of anon.  <br>Sorry, I was too busy paying attention to posts like .</br>  <br>h-how so</br>  <br>No. I didn't get anything last week either.</br>  Requesting Kochou Yoshida trying in a new swim top but is bummed because it no longer fits.  <br> 8681x4092 <br> 2.76 MB <br><br>For one of the first times I'm glad my waifu isn't in a collage, cause I sure as hell wouldn't be able to load and save something this big, without it closing out my SAI and freezing my computer.</br></br></br></br>  Requesting my waifu in the same outfit as the Stakes of Purgatory/Angel Mort uniform. <br><br>Having similar emphasis to the third picture would be appreciated, although I would still like to see her face.<br><br>http://imgur.com/a/XdeQQ#0</br></br></br></br>  <br>http://vocaroo.com/i/s1SKmVzPT7iB</br>  <br>e-eh, can zoom in a lot, i guess?<br>it felt more comfy to colour<br><br><br>i kinda minimize the layer usage to save RAMs tho, 15 layers thus far, i kinda went 256 before, lappy still okay </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>Oh cool! I didn't notice from the earlier WIP that she  maid  it in. I'm looking forward to the end result.</br>   Salmon will never draw her   <br>your waifu's really cute and so are you, kaedebro<br><br><br>e-eh, maybe next time, i guess?</br></br></br></br>  Requesting Tamamo dressed as your favorite shipgirl or abyssal girl. If you don't like Kancolle then anything is fine. I'd love to see more of her in her casual outfit as well.  <br>thank god</br>  Requesting Crona doing something comfy in the blue sweater outfit (bottom right). Anything else would be fine too.<br><br>Thanks!</br></br>  Requesting C.C. cosplaying as Tama.  Requesting Hagoromo Gitsune leading her hyakki yakou or wearing the outfit on the right side of the reference. Anything else is fine, too.  I'd like to make a request for Makise Kurisu. Any theme you're interested in drawing would be fine with me whether it's comfy, cute, lewd, etc. If you could find a way to incorporate either a lab coat or Dr. Pepper, I'd be very happy.<br><br>Thanks again for taking time out of your day for this</br></br>  <br>It's cool, I know you're busy with your own thing. You should check it out though, the quality is really good, which is lucky considering it's her only figurine. The's hair is extremely nice though, given how it's modeled in layers with individual hairs waving through the air. The pipe is painted and detachable too, but due to the wonky finger it sometimes falls down, not that I mind much. My only real complain is the stand itself, since it angles her downward so she's practically looking at the floor, so I need to adjust and angle her properly so she looks forward.<br><br>It's pretty good though, it beats out the art book by a small margin. After looking through it, I've only seen a few pictures online but no full scans. It's unfortunate too, given how much extra content there is in there, including interviews with the two main VAs as well. Also a helpful timeline in there too, which is good for clarifying dates. I'm not sure how many fans have the official art book, but I'm glad I managed to get a copy. I wish she had more merch like other characters, but for the little bit she does have, it's all pretty high quality. I'm happy I could support her series and her creator like this, not to mention being able to see her fig every time I look to my side. I guess you could just call it dedication you could say, even if it's just money being spent. I mean, who wouldn't have merch of their waifu, right?</br></br></br>  <br> waifu has maid costume <br> still missed maid collage <br>Oh well maybe next time.</br></br></br>  Requesting my lovely wife, Yuzuko, getting a brain freeze from eating shaved ice. However anything would be fine.  <br>  that you scanny? </br>  Requesting my lovely flower being lovely as usual.  Requesting Rikka Takanashi in a wedding dress, or anything cute would be appreciated as well. Thank you drawfriends for putting up with all our shit to get us our waifus you truly are awesome.  <br>Many people buy figs. Many people haremfag, too. Not many people troll in the same way for four years, though, so that at least sets you apart. It's too late to patch it up, son.</br>  Requesting Minatsu wearing a nontraditional miko outfit. Visible midriff and making the ribbons match the outit is a plus.<br>Anything else is fine too, thanks.</br>  If you share a common interest in waifu, does that mean you're a cuck?  <br>No.</br>  Requesting Sawyer with a teddybear or stuffed animal of some sort:<br><br>http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=1673276<br>http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=1842966<br><br><a href="http://i.4cdn.org/a/1435278216465.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.4cdn.org/a/1435278216465.j<wbr>pg</wbr></a></br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  Requesting Maki-chan as a mahou shoujo please  streaming<br><br>  https://www.picarto.tv/live/multist<wbr>ream.php?watch=kuso </wbr> </br></br>  <br>Some people do, I don't approve, but hey that's their choice, not mine, am I right? Good luck on catching this guy you're after though, after 4 years he might not even be around you know? I hope it's worth the time and effort spent, it'd suck pretty badly if you got the wrong guy too, that'd be a lot of wasted time. <br><br>Oh yeah, and if I could make a suggestion? There's a lot of stuff you could call other anons, but I'd avoid "son" if I were you, makes you come off as being a bit condescending you know? Not good for your reputation, know what I mean? Just a suggestion, but either way if I don't see you again soon, good luck on that pursuit of yours bud.</br></br></br>  Requesting Chronoire at the beach with sunburn on her shoulders/nose or anything else cute, thanks  Requesting Pacifica as a cute sailor girl, please!<br>http://img.ctrlv.in/img/15/06/26/55<wbr>8d58e48832c.jpg</wbr></br>   go to a Chinese restaurant for lunch <br> grab a fortune cookie <br> read inside <br> "There is beauty in simplicity" <br> "Painter　画(huà)家(jiā)" <br>I think this damn cookie is trying to tell me something</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some people like the one(s?) mentioned in , yes.

Happy anniversary</br>  <br><br>Good night</br></br>  <br>That is so badass.</br>  so who here just wants a doodle of their waifu/husbando since they didnt get anything.<br><br>im not making any promises though, and it will possibly be until next week end when i deliver</br></br>  <br>Different people, though I'd think the same if I were in your position.</br>  <br> Gif <br>Fucking sweet</br></br>  <br><br>I didn't get anything last week either.</br></br>  http://sharkweekcountdown.com/<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lV8<wbr>i-pSVMaQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Holy shit that's pretty damn great.</br>  <br>Whoa, this is awesome.</br>  <br>Yomikawa jogging or doing some jumping jacks please.</br>  Tamamo in flowery lingerie/a negligee<br>Thanks<br><br>Remind me, does art of her wearing  Shimakaze's   outfit exist?  </br></br></br>  <br>Nice job kuso.</br>  Requesting Kyou Fujibayashi dressed as White  <br>woaaahhhhh<br>how the hell do you even</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>thanks m8s i'm gonna go pass out now</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting Tsubaki dressed as Tsubaki, please. Fox ears and tail are not needed.  <br>Ponytail y/n?</br>    <br>Yesss</br>  PukaPuka  <br>Yo that's kawaii as fuck nigga.</br>  Hopes dying out  <br>That's fucking cute.</br>  <br>Ponytails a best</br>  <br> hi noccu </br>  so i might have missed some important information earlier, but are lewds discouraged/not allowed in WWD?<br>i honestly have never run into this before because ive never seen it brought up so i apologize for the mix up.<br> head pats fix everything </br></br>  Requesting Vert wearing a suit and tie, please!  <br> h-hi </br>  <br>Cute-lewds are allowed.</br>  <br>Some people seem to think they can prevent others from wanting them, but in the end it's all about what the drawfriends are interested in.</br>  <br>She looks like Araragi Karen with less meat, but is an awesome work you deserve the heaven for this nigga</br>  <br>Generally no. Tasteful lewds are kinda borderline ok. <br>basic rule of thumb is - if the OR didn't request lewds in particular, steer clear.</br></br>  <br>Just don't be a piece of shit asking for your "waifu" to be fucked by a thousand horse dicks and nobody will care.</br>  <br>Some people like lewd, some people are neutral towards it and some despise it. You'd need to ask the specific requester. I dunno how many people here would like a thick load blown on their loved one.</br>  <br> head pats fix everything  <br><br>My African American male next of kin.</br></br></br>  <br> I hope to see you draw her smile someday <br><br>S-sorry. Take this for now. It's just a sketch but I hope it's not terrible.</br></br></br>    <br>Eyebrows</br>  <br>i dont mind as long as its cute.</br>  <br>thats pretty good nigga don't stutter<br><br> not OR </br></br></br>  <br> but I hope it's not terrible. <br><br>It's fucking  wonderful and I hope the OR appreciates it. Even for "just a sketch" you did very well. </br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Not OR, but your art reminds me of how wonderful Bleach's girls are, despite everything else, almost makes me want to pick it back up, or at least keep an eye on it.</br>  <br>I want a picture of my waifu getting a head pat like this</br>  <br>OR here, it's great, thank you a lot! Hope you don't mind me asking, but  any chance of you drawing a dick inbetween her hands? It'd be really nice and I'd appreciate it tons. </br>  ITT: mediocre shows with amazing first episodes  <br> 1st episod <br> good <br>shit taste of the highest caliber, as long as a show has some pantsu you'll call it aoty, wont you?</br></br></br>  Madoka  <br>Well, yeah. You only like "mature" anime, huh?</br>  <br>Underrated gem</br>  <br>What is Nobunagun?</br>  Ship?   all these Rindou doubters <br> mfw they will eat crow when Rindou becomes relevant and she goes for the Somabowl <br><br>I've read enough shonen manga to know how this shit will go. A pretty higher-up character that's part of a hierarchy? Are you fucking delusional to think something won't happen between the two of them now that soma wants to climb that ladder?<br><br>Keep doubting cause the Rin train is just getting started.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice try anon, I'm a  Hisakofag </br>  <br> anon,according to my headcanon she's the dark horse-deal with it </br>  <br> I like character x's design and strongly dislike character y <br> She is already a better character <br><br>Why do people get so butthurt all the time? The anon you're quoting apparently doesn't even like Megumi himself.<br>Let alone, it's already clear that best girls are  Mizuhara and Hishoko </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>RINDOU OR DEATH<br>I<br>N<br>D<br>O<br>U<br><br>O<br>R<br><br>D<br>E<br>A<br>T<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127283554#p127306695">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What is her secret of her youth?  <br>It is weird for Oda to use two really similar names like that, but otherwise thats retarded<br><br>There's also this one, that Devil Dias is related to Bart because of the same name and chest tattoos.</br></br></br>  <br>She was given immortality by the last Ope-Ope user</br>  <br>I think there was some more to it, but it was basically "Kuma has a son" and, not really to support why that son is Bartolomeo. Something about the marines blackmailing him for loyaly.</br>  <br> What is her secret of her youth? <br><br>Nice grammar, shitpiece fag.</br></br></br>  Everything else aside, which series had the better final fight? Zero's batcave brawl or UBW's temple showdown?<br><br><br> Shirou vs Gilgamesh <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=F_5<wbr>Q0QDaH5w</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Kirei vs Kerry <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=NSg<wbr>XOZKSt20</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean they didn't chat like faggots.</br>  <br>Zero's LN climax.</br>  <br>Kirei vs. Kerry. Gilgamesh spending most of the fight standing in place and exchanging swordspam like some fucking medieval Gundam SEED Destiny was fucking boring. It was only the final leg of the fight that was really entertaining.</br>  <br> I mean they didn't chat like faggots <br>Because IIRC in Fate/stay night Kirei told Shirou that they never spoke and tried to kill each other the very first time they met</br></br>  <br> Kirei vs Kerry didn't even have Emiya playing <br><br>It's shit</br></br></br>  Pretty sure natural boobs don't float like this in water. Did Sento get her tats done for the OVA?   these people are back again <br><br>I wonder if they're autistic enough to try and bait the thread all the way to 500 posts again tonight</br></br>   show about magic <br> girl pulls a gun out of her vag constantly <br> /a/ decides to question the realisticness of floating boobs </br></br>  <br> two right feet </br>  <br><br>I thought so too, but so what? If you can tell when a line is wrong then you can just use subs as a crutch. <br>As long as I understand what's said it's fine. Be grateful we even have subs at all, especially this short after it came out. It's an OVA after all.</br></br></br>  <br>The Nyaa cartel does this as well.<br>Nothing new.</br></br></blockquote>]
