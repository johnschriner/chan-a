[ Kaidou is edgy    immortal wants to die <br> edgy <br><br>This word has lost all meaning</br></br></br>  <br>All we know is that he stopped him from going there, he could easily simply convince him.<br> Kaidou, it's pointless. Before you will get there, everyone will be either too tired or too dead to try to kill you.  <br> Whitestache can't die before fighting against me! <br> Come on, I recently matched Whitestache's Haki with my own.  <br> I want you to hit me as hard as you can. <br> What? <br> I want you. To hit me. As hard. As you can. <br><br>Kaidou's Zoan army wasn't for purpose of greatest war ever where he could die. At least not at first. It started as a fight club Kaidou formed to seek men that can punch him hard enough. Guys simply started to follow him around and that's how he gained territory and became a Yonkou.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> thread starts with forced kid memes <br><br>Shitpost general? Shitpost general.</br></br></br>  repost, since I posted in old thread after new thread was made<br><br><br>I mean<br> he wanted Caeser and whatever inventions/forces he could get his hands on. Caeser was the competitor scientist to vegapunk, and it's clear that vegapunk and caeser have invented things for Marines/Pirate underworld to revolutionize battle, so it's like an arms race. I was kind of hoping thats where. <br> Kaido is ruthless, like Stalin levels. In fact, Kaido, like all Yonko, take territories kind of like the USSR and the Warsaw pact and shit. <br><br>I just feel like the age of pirates and sailboats mixed with actual cyborgs, lasers, snail based TV's and phones and shit felt like it's oddly coexisting, you know? I kind of hoped that Kaido would be the answer to "fuck the old-age pirate shit, the new future age is here!" and he'd have more modern/sci-fi/steampunk crew and gear. The Zoan army thing just made me think he'd want anything that wasn't human.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't give people any ideas.</br>  i thought he looks pretty fucking baller  <br>Stop contradicting my strawman.</br>  <br><br><br>it's just me here who think he must be a very nice guy?!</br></br></br>  Why am I reminded of Kenpachi?  <br>nice meme thread</br>  <br><br> Kaido isn't strong, just obscenely lucky and is basically One Piece's version of King <br> Luffy knocks him out when they fight because of his own broken ass luck <br> Kaido becomes a Strawhat fanboy and starts following Luffy around begging for another fight </br></br></br></br>  Reposting here from the end of the last thread because people keep missing the point about Doflamingo. I'm not a Doffyfag, I'm not even sure what that is. But just because Doflamingo did stupid things doesn't mean he's a bad character.<br><br> Doffy failed to kill law at least three times <br>He only tried to kill Law once - when he shot Law full of bullets - or the dude that Law switched himself with at least, unbeknownst to Doflamingo. The first two rounds were humiliation. Doflamingo wanted Law to take up the heart seat, he even chained Law to that seat with seastone. He only sought to kill when it was clear Law would never bend.<br> He failed to kill luffy/law once they were in the Cave. <br>That was a string clone, and it was easily dispatched by Abdullah and Jeet. Luffy fucked up another string clone later on off-screen without any trouble. The string clones aren't that strong.<br> He allowed everyone in the palace to escape when especially when law was handcuffed and pica was present. <br>As soon as he used birdcage, his plan was to kill fucking everyone besides himself. That's where his tragic flaw comes in. He is incapable of even entertaining the thought that he might be defeated. So when the odds are stacked against him, he'll just resort to the ultimate method of killing everyone he can within his cage. He cares about his family, yes, but if they fail to succeed, they'll be cut down too. He'll just start anew after everyone's down.<br> He left the mera mera no mi to a fodder like diamante which caused sabo (luffy ally) to be stronger. <br>Now here's an actual flaw. It was just bait. He wasn't counting on Luffy winning. He didn't really care who the prize went to, and that's the huge thing that people miss when bringing this up. He thinks himself above ANYONE, whoever that might be, even i f they win the mera mera. The only purpose was to drag in Luffy and get rid of him, securing Caesar in the process.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>bleach is shit</br>  <br>its cuz of all the semen in your mouth, swallow it</br>  <br> The guy was still persistent to fight at the ending even after most of his crew was down, destroyed factory, and having fucked up organs. The war was never for him to win even if he defeated luffy zoro or even sabo would take him out in his weak condition.The should've left or even better go outside birdcage and witness everyone doom. He could've have left but instead stay to fight a battle which he had already lost and get himself captured. <br>Again, he never entertained the fucking thought that he would lose. He was 100% certain he would be able to beat down someone like Luffy and clean up all the mess afterwards. He was having a nice day at the beach, built a nice sand castle called Dressrosa, and them stomped it down before he left. Sure he had suffered damage, probably more than he ever had, but he was still standing when Luffy was not.<br> Crocodile didn't make that many mistakes and always had a backup plan when something didn't go as planned. <br>True. Doflamingo's backup plan was always himself. But it was indeed a BACKUP PLAN. His first course of action was to silent any dissent by turning problematic people into toys. He's smart, but he's much more arrogant than he is intelligent. If the first plan fails, well, then he'll just kill everyone. That didn't work, and that's why he lost.</br></br></br></br>  I have no fucking clue what's going on with Sanji and friends, but Kaidou's entrance was pretty hype. Good use of narration.  <br><br>I wish Oda did it more often, but then maybe it might lose its impact I guess.</br></br>  <br><br>And now I'm reminded that I'm in a thread about manga for kids.</br></br>  <br>the only thing done right is that the body drawing fits the pic. Otherwise you can go back to /v/</br>  so, kaido will go on a rampage when he finds out doflamigo got captured / no smile<br>will he go after strawhats as well because theyre to blame?<br>that was laws plan to begin with anyway, right?</br></br>  does he wants to make the war to find someone to kill him?  <br><br>Probably.</br></br>   shadow looks like a cockroach <br> mustache look like antennae <br> cockroaches are known for being hard to kill <br>GUYS</br></br></br>  <br> getting triggered by said kids talking shit about the manga-for-kids you read. </br>   Whitebeard dies, removing the only man you thought capable of fighting you <br> Become depressed and embark on a 2 year quest to find the most effective suicide method <br> 10,000m drop fails, fuck it time to destroy the world </br></br>  I didn't think that shitposter would take over /v/ so fast after Kaidou gets revealed, it's disgusting.  <br>It's all coming full circle.</br>  <br>You meant bring over or you meant /a/?</br>   Horn hands guy is called "Sheep`s head" <br> Smiles are defective <br> Smiles users can trasnform into animal parts <br> Momo didnt eat a smile but vegapunk's failed attemp of creating a man-made DF </br></br></br>  <br>Sanji and friends escaped from Big Mom - probably with a coup de burst as usual - and some time later on arrived at an island which may or may not be Zou. We're told they've met a girl which is almost certainly pic related. Brook says they were distracted by her. They're attacked by Kaido's henchmen, led by a guy called Sheepshead. Brook and Sanji take him down, and the rest retreat, the woman exclaiming that they must report that the "samurai" isn't there. This might refer to Momonosuke because he's in dragon form, or Kinemon or Kanjuro, we don't know. Chopper urges them to come somewhere, we don't know what's going on, but apparently it's urgent.<br><br>That's what I gathered from the scene, I'm not sure why it would be so hard to follow.</br></br></br>  Did I miss something between this chapter and last? Why were the Strawhats suddenly being chased by what I guess is Big Mom's cronies?  <br> the guy you paid to build you an army gets fucked up by mad gorilla  <br><br>Being Kaiou is suffering.</br></br></br>  <br> Dressrosa went for so long speedreaders don't even remember how it started. </br>  <br> somebody is going to take this bait seriously <br>Release day~ <br>Release day~<br>Release day~</br></br></br></br>  so how do you kill the kaido?  <br>Who will she end up being a tsundere towards? Chopper? Momo? Awkward furry love triangle?</br>  Guys I'm thinking of updating my OP Manga collection. I've always used domdomsoft to download stuff and I've recently learned that the panda translations are shit. <br>How do I get the more correct translations?</br>  <br>Good possibility.<br><br>Probably why he's pissed that Whitebeard started a war without him and ended up dying. Guess he never had a chance to go 1 on 1 with Whitebeard whose probably on par in strength with him?<br><br><br>I definitely need to reread this arc</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How do I get the more correct translations? <br>Download the raws and learn japanese</br></br>  <br> Are you literally so god damn stupid that you are incapable of comprehending a manga direct at 12 year olds? Those were obviously Kaido's men how could you have missed the jolly roger?<br><br> I really can't believe how stupid the people that post here can be.</br></br></br>  <br>Aren't they also trying to save someone, or was Chopper refering to Nami, Brook and Monosuke when he threatened Ceasar?</br>  <br>Bepo<br>And he wont get get it, he'll just apologize.</br></br>  What is this new epic meme trend of putting "One Piece" in the subject field but launching straight into a shitposting thread?<br><br>I imagine its the work of a single person, but why do people bother replying?</br></br>  <br> Sanji and friends escaped from Big Mom - probably with a coup de burst as usual - and some time later on arrived at an island which may or may not be Zou. <br>the thing is why were sanji, chopper and ceasar split up from the others?</br></br>  Will Blackbeard appear in this arc?  <br>a day passed. It's to imply they have their own off-screen adventures.</br>   Chopper manning up and threatening Ceasar <br> Chopper taking initiative and directing the party <br> Chopper-sized female introduced with animal aspects <br> No Law around to ninja the doctoring <br><br>Is this...the fabled Chopper character development? Has it come at last after that cock-tease with the sick kids on Punk Hazard?</br></br></br></br></br>  Well. The first Kaido porn with his new design is out.  <br>All of them are looking much better. Oda putting hald the crew to rest was the best to everybody.</br>  <br>Only took a day, that was quick</br>   why didnt just drown him to sea with seastone?   <br> dat pimp doffy face <br> we won't see him pimp some whores <br><br>Oda always get scared away to show this stuff, even through Doffy was an obvious pimp.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Chopper hates Ceasar enough to do that mainly cause he's a corrupt doctor</br>  <br>gross. where?</br>  <br>Well that was quick...<br><br><br>  post it  </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> checked <br>We just don't know. When Chopper goes on about saving "them" he might just be referring to Nami, Brook and Momonosuke or he might be talking about the girl. We're just thrown into the middle of a scene and everything is conjecture at the end of the day.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a Suicide Fruit? I just thought he literally is just a victim of a circumstance</br>  <br><br> Kaido has a soft heart for Beasts, which is why all his followers are Zoan or manmade Zoan users <br> Likes Chopper and wants him to join his crew <br> Uses this Deer Jailbait <br><br>Also, I always wondered if we would see other interesting Devil fruit like a 'Human Human Fruit: Model Imp" or something</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>seriously. so happy with brook's and nami's new outfits.</br>  <br> samefagging when you already got replies <br><br>You should lurk so you your methodism won't feel forced, it needs to go naturally.</br></br></br>  I want to fertilize nami  <br><br>underated post</br></br>  <br> suicide fruit </br>  <br>extra you typo there, but you get the point.</br>    <br> them <br> he might be talking about the girl <br>No, he was clearly speaking about Nami's group which Sanji saved right afterwards. Why are shounen manga to hard to understand fro you /v/ermin?</br></br></br>  <br>It really has become too large, the amount of screentime each member eats up is disgusting, not even to mention the necessary byplay between crewmates<br> Chapter begins <br> Luffy acts dumb <br> Zoro had a bad sense of direction while Sanji womanizing and then the two fight <br> Nami has breasts and is greedy <br> Robin says something morbid <br> Franky is being outrageous <br> Chopper is being shy <br> Brook is being outrageous <br> Ussop is afraid <br> Half a panel of plot <br> Chapter ends, next chapter delayed 2 weeks <br><br>Although having Zoro devoid of his rival made him a damn dull character this arc, even if he managed to fulfill his arcly qouta of acquiring a new monster girl for his harem.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What ?</br>    <br>That hair. That skirt.</br>  <br>I hope he continues to draw her a bit thicker, that cartoon-thin waist had gotten old.</br>  <br>Well obviously the pronoun most likely refers to a group of people here, but even with mangastream we're talking about an unreliable scanlation so you never know</br>  <br>Why bother with clothes at this point</br>  <br>Wicca's the best character to come out of Dressrosa. Wicca next crewmate or I'm dropping.</br>  <br><br> those hips <br> those thighs <br><br>Thank you Oda.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>her legs are much better than in early dressrosa. It feels like Oda really wanted to draw this chapter.</br>  <br> we're talking about an unreliable scanlation so you never know <br>yeah the sheep guy is probably an octopus, isn't he? I feel you.</br></br>  <br>How did mansherry get so big?</br>  <br>faggot</br>  <br>I hope we actually get to see what happened to their "fight" with Mom, if not i'll be truly dissapointed. I don't think they just ran away, since they were clearly fighting when Capone was watching for Caesar.</br>  <br>It's a general thread<br>All generals are shitpost generals</br></br>  <br>I like how he's switched the comically oversized golden crown for an even more comically undersized top hat than his original one</br>  <br>The problem with Zoro is that he massively over leveled for the start of the New World, even compared to the rest of the crew.</br>  This thread is under Divine Protection from God Buggy himself. Fujoshits are not welcome in this place, and if they post gay shit they will unleash the wrath of God.  <br>Why the fuck do people actually think we won't get a flashback of what happened? We always do. Just be patient.</br>  <br>He's probably missed drawing them, the characters actually show a bit of passion instead of their usual window dressing.</br>  <br>Shit, I missed one.</br>  <br>Reminder that Oda said that only someone as powerful as Buggy-sama could escape the birdcage</br>  <br> comically undersized top hat than his original one <br>best part of his new outfit. that and his stripped pants.</br></br>  I hope brook dropped that ugly ass fish guitar  <br> implying Kaidou has devil fruit powers </br>  <br> Jiryoku on Tumblr.  I'm warning you though, it's gross as fuck. Seeing as it's with WB.  </br>  <br>man i missed her. THANK YOU ODA FOR MINISKIRT</br>  Reposting from the other thread<br><br>  # <br> And you saw how a sickly Whitebeard could hold off 3 Admirals in their prime? <br><br>lol no. Whitebeard was a bitch.<br><br>Aokiji dodged his glave and was about to fuck his shit if it wasn't for Jozu saving his ass.<br><br>Kizaro didn't really fight him and just casually hit him with a light beam.<br><br>Akainu burned half his face and put a huge hole in his chest.<br><br>Whitebeard was a shitter who was too reliant on his durability/physical strength but his actual fighting style fucking sucks. He didn't bother trying to dodge/block people attacks and instead was just tanking them and hitting back.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jesus fuck what's wrong with those people?</br>  People have pointed out ht tatoo as a sign that he's not indestructible, and speculate that either WB or Roger did it.<br>But they're missing the man that gave Kaido his biggest scar, one that covers his entire arm.<br><br>THE TATOO ARTIST<br><br>Kaido's tatoo artist was capable of permanently engraving something into his skin. <br>He's probably even more powerful than Buggy</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>all four of them look full of life and much more expressive.</br></br>  Which are the 5 best fights in the series?<br><br>Does anything from the new world remotely count?</br></br>  <br>weak tbh</br>  <br> implying it's not dragon scales. </br>   I want to die <br>ok we'll just tie these heavy metal weights to you and sink you to the bottom of the ocean<br> nah jk <br>Kaidou in a nutshell.

I lost touch</br></br>  <br>Did you ate the Dick Dick fruit ?</br>  <br>Sheep have horns. I guess whatever that's somehow thematically reasonable is okay with zoans now.<br><br>I actually prefer that, come to think of it. Zoans are too restricted, apart from Chopper.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Lost hands <br> Bought new metal hands <br> Fed new fruit to hands <br> My Hands are sheep <br>  I walk around my comrades with weird ass sheep hands </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aw fuck, the first sentence should be<br> People have pointed out the SCAR as a sign that he's not indestructible, </br></br>   Luffy doesn't kill you he kills your dreams <br> Kaido's dream is to die  <br><br>How does this even</br></br></br>  <br> wikifags </br>  <br> This might refer to Momonosuke because he's in dragon form, or Kinemon or Kanjuro, we don't know <br>Kinemon mentioned a fourth samurai on the Sunny that everyone on /a/'s seem to forgotten about</br></br>  <br><br>I mean for the purposes of the series and us readers it's bad, but he's done the best thing.</br></br>  <br> apart from chopper <br><br>Kaku did a pretty good job of messing around with his fruit.</br></br></br>  <br>Chapter 730</br>  So are they on Zou or Wano  One piece has been going on for far to long and needs to fucking end. Its only going on for the sake of money.  <br><br>It just did.<br><br>More Robin, but not like before.</br></br></br></br>  Who here reads Japanese? I'd love for someone to translate the RAW, MP and MS made a lot of fuck ups as usual  <br>0/10</br>  <br>They were told to go to Zou.

Fujos don't know how to fucking prioritize.</br>  <br> XDrake </br>  Kaido appear to be the weakest Yonko. <br><br>Yeah you can't kill him but that's his gimmick. The fact that he was defeated and imprisoned multiple times make me think he's actually not that strong in an actual fight.</br></br>  <br>Either Oda off panels the confrontation which wouldn't surprise me since he off panels damn near everything these days.<br><br>Or they talk their way out of it.</br></br></br>   Visit Arlongpark <br> See arlongpark.wikia <br> Everybody's dickriding Greg <br><br> MFW </br></br></br></br>  <br>no you're just annoying. stop.</br>  <br>Honesly Kaido dosn't really seem to mind then, i think he just happened to land there and is not really going to bother with then, IF they don't start shit with him.</br>  <br><br>At any point has it been confirmed that Kaidou uses a DF?</br></br>  <br> XD <br><br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Kidd is the kind who will attack though.</br></br>  <br>Perfect</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128816407 <br><br>I wouldn't do that if I were you<br/></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br> &gt;&gt; </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Completely obliterated Moria <br> Doflamingo scared shitless of him <br> not strong </br></br></br>  <br>Don't be triggered by people pointin you can't samefag. If you get mad this easy, consider Kaidou yourself.</br>  <br><br><br>I finally figured out what's so different about her, Oda is drawing her as a young woman again instead of a ganguro girl.</br></br></br>  <br>Let's hope his mom does his job and keeps him down for once.</br>  <br><br>Whats the problem with <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128816407  ?<br><br>They both slipped on a wet floor.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying he didn't let himself be captured in hopes to be killed </br>  <br><br>Kidd n co have sunk Big Mom's ships during Fishman Island, and they have targeted Shanks in the last few chapters.<br><br>Has there been any interaction between the Kidd alliance/Kaidou?</br></br></br></br>  so there will be another timeskip right? there's no way strawhats can handle a yonko yet, doffy was scared as fuck of kaido and just to beat him luffy had to go all out and the help of trafalgar "lol only 9mm" law  <br>Kidd's alliance only exists to attack Kaido and horribly fail to hype him up. This is all those b-tier scrubs can hope to achieve. Mourn the fact they didn't get a super-rare ultra-powerful DF.</br>  What will Big Mom say when she devours Kidd?<br><br> You're kidd-in me! </br></br>  <br>Compared to other Yonkos I mean. WB probably humilated him multiple times back in the day. <br><br>Several admirals kicked his ass probably as well (was imprisoned 18 times).</br></br></br>  kaidou intro was underwhelming tbh  <br>pretty gay tbh fam</br>  <br>Sorry, my native language doesn't have gender-specific pronouns and I was under the impression that "they" could be considered gender-neutral referring to an individual as well as a group of people. That's hardly the same as an octopus in comparison to a sheep</br>    <br>dude really? Most OP chara and no DF?<br>please...</br></br>  <br>What the hell did you want? That he came in wrecking shit immediatly? I tought that intro was perfection, it was long and hyped who the "suicide" guy was.</br>  <br>I don't remember if it was a mod or a jani, but yes, it's a horse-fucker who don't watch anime and writes gay fanfics. It's a legit leak.</br>  <br>I guess, but jumping off of a Sky Island is still pretty damn cool.</br>  Today is MY birthday, do you have any gifts for me??  <br> What is Shanks <br> Raylegh <br> Roger <br><br>Please</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm making fun of his typo ironically. Don't be too trigger-happy, anon!</br>  <br>KING</br>  <br>There will be no 2nd timeskip, that would be retarded and unfitting<br><br>Luffy won't take down Kaidou alone obviously. He'll get help, just like in Dressrosa.</br></br></br>  <br>here is a picture of Samus looking cute in best suit</br>  Why do people nowadays always assume that edgy automatically = bad?  <br><br>Shanks/Mihawk who are arguably the two strongest characters in the series, they seem to get along fine without devil fruits.</br></br>  <br>KONG</br>  <br> Wants to die <br> hasn't eaten two devil fruits <br> probably hasn't even eaten just one and jumped into the ocean <br><br>Oda pls</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>+ garp<br>+ mihawk<br><br>df overrated</br></br></br></br>  <br>The only gift you deserve...</br>  <br>I'm gonna miss that Flamingo.</br>  <br> implying a passing ship wouldnt come by and save him </br>  <br>It was awesome and silly at the same time which is what one piece is all about. God Oda does it again.</br>  <br><br>1. Luffy vs Lucci<br><br>2. Zoro vs ryuma<br><br>3. Vergo vs law and smoker<br><br>4. Luffy vs hody<br><br>5. Akainu vs whiteboard</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Kaidou on that island looking for a samurai because reasons <br> decides to search for him in the volcano/giant geyser <br> the "eruption rain" launches him onto a sky island <br><br>If that's the case, I guess that means Kaidou's crew, Big Mom's crew and the Kidd alliance are all in close proximity.

I have no idea how the situation will play out with the Kidd alliance, they might go after Shanks after all with the big guy in tow because that plot point was already brought up.</br>  <br>What about the zo arc</br>  <br>Clothes can make a girl sexier.</br>  <br> space before punctuation <br>FRENCHFAG GO HOME</br></br>  <br>He's a rubberman.</br>  <br>aww yeah</br>  <br> You mean authors? <br><br>No, everyone else.<br><br> Because if so, pic related. <br><br>I don't know what that is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Any rule 63 of kaido out?  <br>yeah but he can't do that with his arms, he has to wind up and throw them</br>  <br>Her reaction face there makes it look like that's his dick shooting out into her ass from the top left.</br>  Well no more:<br><br>"I-It's Donquixote Doflamingo!"<br>"Ah?!

Like, a weapons dealer or something that could hire a mad scientist with no moral code to produce artificial fruits. Man, a cool idea like that would certainly make me SMILE.</br>  <br>BREHS</br>  in all honesty going all the way up from skypia to jump seems a bit is pointless, a person typically reaches terminal velocity in around 12 seconds from a jump, so kaidou would spend about 3 minutes at a constant velocity before he hits the ground.    <br>In terms of what? Popularity?</br>  <br>i think shanks is just as strong since he managed to hold off kaidou during marineford<br><br>and later arrived without a scratch</br></br></br>      <br> Implying air resistance in One Piece is consistent with our own <br> Implying their gravitational acceleration is the same <br> Implying longer drops aren't more hardcore and therefore deadlier </br></br></br>  <br>Nigger what about the time Shanks and Kaido butter heads when Shanks stoped him from going to the war? The ship was tottaly fine and Shanks and nobody else looked hurt. <br><br>It's a little too early to be throwing these around.</br></br></br>  <br> A cutout and shitty filters are fanarts <br>KEK</br></br>  <br>Kaidou went to Skypiea to visit, and found out that Doflamingo had been fueling the fighting going on when Luffy arrived. Enraged by this, Kaidou now wants to kick the shit out of Doflamingo, which is why he says just that when he lands. Jumping was just the quick way down.</br>  <br> slash <br> worthwhile </br></br>  <br>Powerlevel faggotry.</br>  <br>He didn't jump from Skypiea though, just from some random sky island.</br>  <br>This one actually looks kinda neat.</br>  <br>girth</br>  So why didn't he just break the ropes and fucked up the marine base to get his swords back?  <br>remember when we thought meadows was kaido<br><br>and then meadows wasnt even a factor in this arc at all because oda forgot him</br></br></br>  <br>Kaidou intercepted Shanks because he wanted Shanks to try and kill him. Why do you think he's been defeated so many times? He WANTS it to happen.</br>  <br>Bb &gt; shenks &gt; kaido&gt; big mom</br>  <br>1) Luffy vs. Crocodile.

No but seriously, how big is he compared to the likes of Whitebeard or giants   <br>4  ME TO POOP ON </br>  <br>Pls dont compare real devil fruits with fake devil fruits</br>  <br><br>Why people assume BM is the weakest? She could be really strong. That Lion guy wasn't even one of her top guys and he had a 330m bounty.</br></br>  <br><br>He wasn't strong enough to break the ropes or to storm the base?</br></br>  <br>We haven't seen his maximum size</br>  <br>We don't know what the fake ones are capable of, but that Kaidou has horns and a scaled left arm is a big enough hint that there's at least 2 animals in him.</br>  <br>Shanks and BB have to be stronger just through plot relevance, and Kaido seems pretty fucking threatening. Also, women in One Piece</br>  <br>Wat will be kaidos funny trai wat if he also is bad with women like sanji.</br>  Anons actually think shanks defeated kaido in combat without a scratch from him or his crew and a perfectly fine ship.<br>Honestly people need to use their brains a little more.</br>  <br>What's the original supposed to be of</br>  <br><br><br><br>retards<br>he was staying imprisoned to help the villagers, if he broke out they would have been punished</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I'd like to think Shanks took a more diplomatic approach.<br><br> hey kaido how about you just let the old man have his moment ok? i mean this guy he's got a really nice opportunity to die like nobody's ever died before here so how bout you just go hang yourself for the millionth time and let the most badass mortal ever just get himself shot at with guns a whole bunch and let him stand there afterwards dead on his feet with some atmospheric narration going on about how cool he was ok? I mean it would really mess with the story if an even stronger guy showed up and started wrecking shit afterwards, you know? </br></br></br>  <br> What will Kaido's funny trait be <br><br>Is that what you're asking? He's a suicidal immortal bored with the world. That's his funny trait.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Bobbin is going to fuck Zoro in the ass.<br><br>Look at that goddamn freak, you know he fights with retard strength and has some freaky DF like a bobbit worm zoan.</br></br></br>  tumblr is excited about this other new character too. I don't know though, he kind of looks like a jobber.  <br>Why do people always complain so much about this If you get weird shit on your dash you're following the wrong people.</br>  <br>would be great, because if luffy wanted to stop shanks getting btfo'd, him and law could hit two birds with one stone, they stop shanks getting attacked by kidhawpoo and fuck up kaidou who is now in on i(maybe)</br>  <br>Like it or not, he's still the 3rd strongest strawhat.</br>  <br>Maybe he is a midget giant</br>  <br>Shanks clearly convinced him not to engage with Whitebeard. Everyone was commenting on how Shanks hadn't taken a single scratch from Kaido before arriving at marineford. So there's either two possibilities. Kaido is a pushover and weak and got his shit wrecked by Shanks or they just talked it out. The first is becoming more and more impossible the more we learn about him.</br>  <br>he was weakened by starvation</br>  <br>Robbin, a bobbin, the big-bellied Ben,<br>He ate more meat than threescore men;<br>He ate a cow, he ate a calf,<br>He ate a butcher and a half;<br>He ate a church, he ate a steeple,<br>He ate the priest and all the people.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Delicious healthy Nami not wearing a bikini <br> Chopper emoting <br> Brook having a good design and being badass <br> Sanji being badass and keeping his manwhoring to a mild eyefuck <br> Kaido <br><br>Best chapter since Sabo showed up.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Being suicidal is not funny.

How come she turned into a massive bitch growing up?</br>  <br>i think its just to give a rugged look, not forced diversification</br>  <br> without being explained as a wacky, harmless quirk. <br><br> Big Mom's ability is making people out of food <br> her entire army is gingerbread-esque men <br> BM's top subordinates take bites out of the fodder when they get hungry. <br> Bobbin decided to try eating REAL people <br> and likes it <br> his first move in any fight is to attempt to bite his opponent's head off </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Soul means Alma in spanish you dumb retard</br></br>  So what do we all think Kaidou's motivation for becoming a pirate was since it is obvious he is going to turn out to be a pretty cool guy. Whitebeard wanted family and Shanks wanted to be a do gooder asshole. Also I'm starting to think maybe Shanks just convinced Kaidou not to attack Marinford.  <br>Yeah, it's like a retard children who shows her friends a ton on drawings she found online because she thinks she'll fit in. Truly pathetic, even for apforum cunts raiding here.</br>  <br>Law treated her like a bitch.</br>  <br>Makes me think how does he take care of all that hair? Dude probably has a huge brush or some shit.</br>  <br>Fuck tumblr at large, but surely you must understand that the exact same assumption applies to 4chan except its overweight virgin males</br>  <br>Beucause she grew up under doflamingo? It's kinda self explanatory.</br>   Rewatching this <br> Notice that Jozu outright says haki <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=coh<wbr>52RaVxuM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>to be fair, the same can be said for here<br><br> can spends hours a day sitting in front of the computer shitposting in comic threads <br> cant take 30 minutes out of a day to exercise and lose that neckbeard </br></br></br></br>  <br>This is perfect for a cover story<br> The Tontattas are sailing the seas <br> Kaidou is floating on top of the water face down trying to drown himself   (let's assume he's not a DF eater) <br> They think they've reached land <br> They drop anchor <br> Start digging for treasure <br> They find the terrain hard <br> Apply superhuman manlet strength <br> Wake him up <br> They shit their pantus and leave <br> Kaidou doesn't realise what was going on and goes back to suicide </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I still think Big Mam has a acid devil fruit. It would explain her obsession with candy.<br><br><br>Because she was treated like shit by her mother.</br></br></br></br>  <br>4chan is wizards/omegas territory afaik.

It could have also meant ambition in that context at that point.</br>  <br>I just figure she's part (komodo)dragon</br>  <br>And this is why being suicidal is funny  In the One Piece universe </br>  <br>hail Buggy-sama</br>  <br>not in my experience<br><br>ive never seen a 'faces of /a/' thread but I doubt anyone here is fit</br></br></br>  <br> spoiler <br><br>Don't pussy out like that. It can be funny sometimes.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh please, i hate to bring up credentials of how much time i've wasted but i've been here since 2007 and 4chan is not and has never been "territory" of any identifiable group, let alone fucking wizards. In fact, I'm pretty sure your stereotypical friendless chan-browsing virgin would deem themselves far too patrician to even enjoy something like One Piece.</br>  <br> Prime Moriah <br> Moriah getting absolutely effortlessly destroyed is "equal" </br></br>  <br>Why do people keep forgetting that Moriah used to be a fucking tank? He's fat and lazy because of Kaidou.</br>  <br>Why command zombies when you can one shot people by cutting their shadows off in broad daylight?</br>  <br> One Piece <br><br>One Piece threads were always newfag territory through, since Marineford. Now tumblr too becuase tumblreenas needed an anime that looked like a cartoon to pretend to like so they could fit in and pretend to be "quirky nerds"</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think there's as much tumblrinas on here as most people think. Tumblr hates 4chan, with a passion.</br>  /Who jumped the sinking doffy ship for kaidou here?/  <br> its overweight virgin males <br>yeah , what of it?</br></br>  <br> his first move in any fight is to attempt to bite his opponent's head off <br><br>Would go well with the Bobbit Worm Zoan.</br></br></br>  <br>I suspect there are, and I also suspect this will eventually lead to op threads getting the naruto treatment eventually.<br>  ;_;  </br></br>  <br>tumblr doesnt need to come here<br><br>there are 4chan blogs ON tumblr</br></br></br>  <br>Well most of the tumblrshit is that one boy who admitted to be shitposting but they try to flock to OP all the time, even through jap stuff offends them a lot</br>  <br>no as soon as capeshit shows started and comic deals /co/ has been flooded with tumblrinas<br><br>it's unbearable over there.<br><br><br>I dont know how many are in /a/</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Congratulations.

It's a pretty subtle joke.</br>  <br><br>Welp</br></br>  <br>There's a flaw in your theory lad.

CD player as a dac/amp usually aren't great. That I agree. Anyone that claim 320kbps MP3 isn't good enough on the go is a load of poppycock. <br><br>Some people use phone as the source, but they do have separate amp/dac as well as suitable set of cans or IEMs for hi-fi on the go. If you are using say Shure SE535 or a Noble CIEM, then it's fine and the difference is definitely appreciable. <br><br>There's no helping it with those cheap earbuds such as the case with Kei.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> she isn't even trying to be lewd though <br>Then why does she wear garters?</br></br>  <br>so her stockings don't fall off?<br><br>that's literally what they're for</br></br></br>  <br>He's a very lewd boy.</br>  <br>To keep her stockings up.</br>  What is this show even about?  <br>Mii-kun being a sex goddess</br>  <br>3 cute girls and a cute boy doing cute things.</br>  <br>memes actually</br>  <br>meme SOL of the season</br>  <br>Moe/comedy SoL with a yuri subplot.</br>  <br>It must be odd seeing the discussion going from cute girls to despair talk then back to cute girls.</br>  <br>The Kurumi is not for sexualizing.</br>  <br>Anon but there's 4 cute girls<br>Did you forget megu-nee?</br></br>  <br>Old hag, and not cute.</br>    <br>Zombies and memes.</br>  Did they just ditch the other girl?  <br>Megu-nee is cute! CUTE!</br>  <br><br>Cute girls, zombies  and memes </br></br>  <br>Sure, so long as a person doesn't mind lugging around a whole damn backpack with him.</br>  <br><br><br>Megumi Sakura waited. The lights above her blinked and sparked out of the air. There were infected in the school. She didn’t see them, but had expected them now for days. Her note to her students were not read to and now it was too late. Far too late for now, anyway.<br>Megumi was a school teacher for fourteen months. When she was teaching she watched the highschoolers and she said to the principal “I want to be teach at the school.”<br>principal said “No! You will BE KILL BY INFECTED”<br>There was a time when she believed him. Then as she got working he stopped. But now in the Megugaoka High school of the Yokosuka she knew there were infected.<br><br><br>“This is Kurumi” the megaphone crackered. “You must find the antidote!”<br>So Megumi left her emergency manual and opened the shutter.<br>“IT GOING TO KILL US” said the Rii<br>“I will shove at him” said the Shovel and she shoved the shovel. Megumi ran at him and tried to shack him off. But then the ceiling fell and they were trapped and not able to kill.<br>“No! I must kill the zombies” she shouted<br>The radio said “No, Megu-nee. You are the zombies”<br>And then Yuki was a retard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is chapter 37 the latest? Because I keep seeing panels I don't recognise and I'm worried I'm behind but can't find anything past it  <br>No.</br>  I swear, if the dog is indeed dead in the anime, I'm going to rage retroactively.  <br>38 was translated I believe.</br>    <br/>  <br>check the archive, there's a mega link with a shitty translation scanlated using korean scans of ch 38</br>    <br>The question here is, are you brave enough? She might  eat  your  dick  or just plain old  eat you </br>  <br><br>Archives anon<br><br>Someone uploaded it to a mega link</br></br></br></br>  <br>Skinwalker Kei?</br>  <br>Here, this one is even more sexual.</br>  <br><br>I chuckled</br></br>  <br>Dog is not dead. Dog is going to die. Look at the show's OP.</br>  <br>Forgot the pic ffs</br>  <br>She won't if I  eat  her  out  before.</br>  <br>It's getting better. DAC/Amp combo are now about size of the original iPod. Bluetooth Aptx has come on the scene and really improving the mobility factor. <br><br>Some people will skin me for saying this, but Beats actually did something positive by making headphone companies design capable low impedance phones on the go. V-Moda's M-100, Beyerdynamic's Custom one pro, Audio-Technica's M-50x and Sennheiser's Momentum would not have come to being the way they have if the age of low impedance cans hasn't dawned the way it has due to Beats.</br></br></br>  <br>元気で〜す</br>  <br>Why is she crying?</br>  <br>Why does she remind me Miku in Symphogear?</br>  <br>The production sure took a nosedive today.</br>  <br>元気 death</br>   No gomin this week   <br><br><br>Thanks, I always forget about the archives<br><br> These new people aren't gonna eat the little girls are they? It seems weird that they'd go unnoticed if they always have lights on and noise </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>And it's going to keep diving.</br>  <br>Shes dying for the dick</br>  <br>Good point.<br><br>M50x is terrible, though, and its equally awful 99% similar predecessor is older than Beats.</br></br></br>  Hmm, this episode wasnt that bad as anons here complained, now that I've watched it...<br><br>That's it. /a/ definitely has shit taste.</br></br>    Daily reminder that Yuki's uniform is green like the others, but color-inverted.  <br><br>The ending was really noice</br></br>  <br> That's it. /a/ definitely has shit taste. <br>You must be new here.<br>Lurk more.<br>A lot more.</br></br></br></br>  Where did they find the futons?  <br>What a twist.</br>  <br> /a/ definitely has shit taste. <br>No big news.</br></br>  <br>So many doujins. So many.</br>  <br>It was okay, but it was by far the worst one yet.</br>  <br>they're in a mall</br>  So is Kei dead or will she show up with the rescue squad at the end?  <br>You can find a lot in a mall</br>  Wasn't Yuki who came up with Taroumarou's name?  Why haven't they gotten any better weapon than a shovel by now?  <br><br>Kei is going to save Miki from the HelmetGuys<br><br> I can feel it </br></br></br></br>    <br>Mall crew was cut out, and hence a significant portion of the survival-theme of the original manga. That's a bad thing.<br><br>The GG-crew sneaking/fighting sequence was actually quite good and I dont know the hate about it, as it salvaged a bit of the survival-theme of the show.<br><br>Kei's motivation for leaving wasnt well done, as it felt like she's just having first world problems ('muh shitting, pissing and cleaning in a small toilet-locker oh no I will die').<br><br>All in all, a solid 7/10</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They had a gun but Miki throw it.</br>  <br>different dog.</br>  <br>I'd rather invert some of her other properties if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>They're little fucking girls. They can't fight grown ass zombies, this isn't some action series. The best course of action is to stay hidden and then fuck off at the first safe chance and as Shovel says she is drastically slowed by her weapon, she just doesn't want to leave it</br>  <br>She'll show up at the end as the antagonistic mastermind responsible for the virus. <br><br><br>Does she even keep that think sharp?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The ED of this episode has as real film noir vibe to it. Kei and Miki's dynamics, the cynical realities and the whole situation speak in the tone of film noir.</br>  <br>You do see her again</br>  <br> fighting sequence was actually quite good and I dont know the hate about it <br>Kurumi was bashing zeds way too easily, if they do show the bathroom scene next time it won't make sense because things got really desperate there with lesser number of zombies.</br></br>  <br>Seems like gakkou gurashi turned into gakkou  gurashiri </br>  <br>Kurumi's the fastest even with the shovel. It's like another limb at this point.</br>    Best  boy    <br> Kei's motivation for leaving wasnt well done, as it felt like she's just having first world problems ('muh shitting, pissing and cleaning in a small toilet-locker oh no I will die'). <br><br>Yeah, thats what really bothered me the most about this episode. It made Kei seem like a stupid girl rather than someone who just gave up hope.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't like this meme.</br>  Man, I feel bad for Mii-kun, Kei just abandoned her in a zombie infested world, seems like a shitty thing for a friend to do.  <br>I wonder if she feels naked without the shovel.</br>  <br>The heli above the mall is probably foreshadowing that they will get to that in the first  and only  season.</br>    <br> ayy </br>    Just how long would the zombie hold together at any rate? It's not like they are taking in water or much in the way of nourishment. They don't seem to cannibalize much either.  <br>  Still not fast enough though was she? <br>She even says herself shed be faster without it during the Sports Festival</br></br>  Help me out here /a/nons. Which other recent anime was it that did the alternate ED thing after a shocking/sad episode?<br><br>There's probably several, but the only other one I watched was No Game No Life and that's not the one I'm trying to remember.</br></br>  <br>Kurumi already goes commando, so in a sense, she's already naked.</br>  <br>madoka magika</br>  <br>Etotama did it.</br>  <br>I think they cut the mal crew for two reasons: 1) to save time and 2) so that Kei and Miki didn't look like dicks when they block the door for the remaining survivors.</br>  <br>She was right though. It just didn't make any sense to sit there and rot.</br>  <br>Not longer than a few weeks without some solid plot Armor and we don't have any yet. They'd also get slower by the day until eventually being immobile</br>  <br>She calls it a handicap, then runs flat-out as if it wasn't there, which builds off the first time she thought she was getting unfit, then realized that she was running with it without noticing.</br>  <br>Right there in the ED, "romance" in the lyrics while Miki holds Kei's hand.<br>So obviously, he's straight.</br></br>  heh  <br>Reminds me, how do Miki's month old unwashed panties smell?</br>  Friendly reminder that traps are 100% gay, no exception<br><br>except  Nobody </br></br>  <br>Madoka did it too? I really have horrible retainment with marathons<br><br>fugg, how could I forget about Uri-tan. Still, it's not one of those, either.</br></br></br>  <br> semen and smegma </br>  <br>If she held off on being "right" for a little while longer, Kurumi and the others would have arrived and she'd still be alive.</br>  <br>Not in the anime, there were no survivors</br>  <br>I never said it came from other people.</br>  Glad to see I'm not in the minority when I didn't like the episode. At least we got to see more of Kei and Miki's relationship and Kurumi's hair tied up.  <br>She's still alive though.</br>  <br>Now I'm certain they're doing this on purpose.</br>  <br>It is pointed in that scene that it is outdated. Do you really watch the episode or just want to sound 'smart'?</br>  Nothing like the matured adult body.  <br>Indeed</br>  <br>I want to  Marry   Megu-nee.</br>  <br>M8</br>  <br>Ha! Jokes on you! He was just pretending to be retarded!</br>  <br> Get stupid </br>  <br> Character thinking of another character <br> They suddenly appear right at that moment <br>Just like Rii finding Ruu, right?</br></br></br>  REMINDER THAT KEI IS ALIVE AND SO IS RADIO-CHAN!  <br>No</br>  <br>Why wouldn't she stop and check? Or want to end her friend's suffering as a zombie? It just doesn't add up.</br>  <br>Or the girls finding Megu-nee in the bunker, right?</br>  <br> as zombie </br>  <br>Shit I need to read the manga</br>  <br> matured <br>Megu-nee is cuter than Yuki.<br>There, I said it.</br></br></br>  <br>Megu-nee is mature and sexy!</br>  <br>HELICOPTER-KUN PARACHUTED OUT OF THE CHOPPER BEFORE IT WENT DOWN<br>MEGU-NEE WAS ONLY PRETENDING TO BE BITTEN</br></br>  <br>You're wrong and you should feel bad.</br>  <br>she's the cutest gurashi<br> even post-mortem </br></br>  Posting best girl.  <br>Yuki-chan was pretending to be retarded all along</br>  Kei's rant reminded me of another famous rant.  So why didn't they try to keep ambiguous that the teacher is dead for those who only follow the animu?<br><br>Magically appearing in the car was way too obvious.<br>I mean any anime only fag already thinks that she is dead, but that scene was basically a "yes, she is dead" .</br></br></br>  <br> Megu-nee is cuter than Yuki. <br>Here you go</br></br>  <br>Good lord that's a huge forehead.</br>  <br>Girls<br>Megu-nee &gt; shovel = Rii &gt; yuki &gt; radio-chan &gt; unisluts &gt; kei<br>Boys:<br>Mii-kun &gt; taroumaru &gt; helicopter-kun &gt; crossbow-kun</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is worst girl bigger than Megu-nee?</br>  <br/>  <br>A miracle of the universe.</br>  <br>Just so Mii-kun could be part of the group from the beginning.

Maybe I'm exaggerating, but at least the animation in Merry was much better.   <br>I don't like that scene in the manga because Miki had the zombies all ever her before Yuki and the others run to help her. There was no way she (and Yuki) could get out of there without getting bitten.<br><br>They should change it to something that makes sense.</br></br></br>   We might never see Miki calisthenics animated   <br> Maybe I'm exaggerating <br>Please. It's not Love Hina or Negima level of horrible.</br></br>  <br>Definitely one of the weaker parts of the manga. I bet they're going to make it so Taroumaru saves Miki by either leading her to the other three or leading the three to Miki.</br>  <br>I agree with this, I spent the next few chapters thoroughly believing she was gonna go full Zombie on them</br>  <br>Why is she singing along?</br>  <br>Because Miki is cute</br>  <br>Talking to herself after being alone for so long</br>  <br>I can understand the feeling. Sometimes I talk to myself and pretend I'm talking to anime characters</br>  Beach special when?  <br> wearing garters and stockings while exercising <br><br>Literally why.</br></br></br>  Looking at the destruction of some of the buildings, I feel as though the zombies just shot rockets at people in the beginning.  <br>Because my dick says it's ok</br>  <br>You gotta look sexy even when you are alone and having physical exercise.</br>  <br>I recognise that bulge. Also never.</br>  <br>It's pretty fucking ridiculous</br>  <br>She knows that death could come at any time and wanted to leave a cute corpse?</br>  <br> that bulge <br>ayy</br></br>    <br><br>That fucking bulge.<br><br>Getting a little hot and bothered here all of a sudden.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Japanese buildings are just like their people, small and feeble</br>  <br><br>Did the zombies call in an fucking airstrike?</br></br>  <br>I feel bad for laughing.</br>  <br>Hey. maybe the entire city has been hit by carpet bombing in attempts to remove the zombies. Gotta view all the angles.</br>  <br> We might never see megane Miki animated </br>  When will she turn?  <br>I tried to jot the lyric down. Can anon step in and fill in the blank?<br><br>When you are by my side<br>I never felt so complete <br>un hmm<br><br>From ??<br>One day when I wake up <br>from this never-ending dream<br>I wanna see you again.<br>All of you ?? days<br><br>So many memories with you now gone<br>I feel so lost without you here by my side<br>when I wake up from this dream <br>I wanna be with you again.<br><br>Remember that moment<br>We took each others' hand<br>If I never let you go so far away<br>we'd still be the same</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's already a monster.</br>  <br>This isn't L4D</br>  <br>That's plausible, but the building right next to the mall is completely unharmed aside from what seems to be a burn mark on the wall.<br>Plus there's not many craters or anything. It's like the city got firebombed and had multiple jets break the sound barrier over every block.</br></br>  <br>It's gonna be good<br>I swear I'll drop this series like hot shit if they pussy out of turning her</br></br>  <br>Not until she becomes a bride.</br>  Does anyone honestly think Kurumi will die? I mean, come on now  <br>She already did, she is just preventing the inevitable.</br>  <br>She fucking better, named characters should not be immune to death</br>  <br>Of course nobody thinks Kurumi will die  because she's already dead. </br>  <br>Filthy slut.</br>  What's with the "gomin" thing?   CGI PEOPLE FUCKING EVERYWHERE <br> CGI ZOMBIES TOO </br>  Taroumaru makes me want to hug my cat, but he's sleeping and I don't want to wake him. ;_;<br><br><br>To make sure you're breathing properly.

It's kind of jarring.</br>  <br>Didn't you watch Tokyo Magnitude 8.0?<br>Otaku and weebs are as dense about this sort of thing as harem protagonists.</br></br>  <br><br>I didn't realize, what a quirk.</br></br>  <br>Good to see that i am not the only one who thought that scene was stupid</br>    <br>She already likes girls, anon.</br>  So what's the /a/ consensus: is Miki a slut?  what's your favourite /gg/ meme?<br><br>My favourite one is the "this adaptation is shit!" meme. Never fails to make me laugh</br></br>  <br>No she doesn't. She is a filthy dirty slut that is ruining the groups purity and needs to die soon.</br>  <br>Kurumi is the slut anon.</br>  <br>He's pure.</br>  <br>Does it matter? It's not like there's any guys around to walk in on them changing / play strip poker with / have drunk sex with /repopulate with. I mean, the only alive male character we've seen that wasn't in a flashback was the helicopter guy.</br>  <br>I think you missed an S?</br>  <br>Nope.</br>  So is the dog's name supposed to sound like Trauma or is that just a coincidence?  <br>my favorite is the "my opinions are correct and anyone who disagrees is wrong". so funny.</br>  <br> only boy in the show <br> slut <br>Leave him alone anon, he only wants to repopulate the Earth</br></br></br>  <br>It sounds only vaguely like it, and Taroumaru is a normal japanese name, so no.</br>   Ah~ I wanna taste a dick!   <br>doujins when?</br>  Did this scene bother anyone else? The color filter, the dark borders, and the silly effect on the zombies on the top image seemed really overdone.   all these   little  girls alive<br><br>Zombies confirmed for shit taste.</br></br>  <br>It's because little girls are cowards and can fit into small holes and boxes since they are small, so they ran away first and avoided conflict. Men, on the other hand, try to act brave and heroic in order to win the little girls, but ended up dying on the process.</br>  <br>Half the previous thread was people complaining about the uneccesary shonenshit</br>  <br>Is your denial that bad?</br>  <br> Old hag, and not cute. <br>Takanashi-kun pls</br></br>  <br><br>Thanks for your input on your favourite /gg/ meme! But what is your least favourite /gg/ meme?</br></br>  <br>It's actually a pretty old meme, and hasn't been funny in years</br>  Why is Miki so  handsome?   <br>Sounds to me anon was complaining the filters, not the action. And I agree. I'm okay with the action, but all this censoring/stylization is a bit too much.</br>  <br>Garter belt.</br>  <br>*complaining about</br>  Damn, Miki is such a slut, why would she wear that if not to get the boys horny.  <br>It's the garters. It's always the garters.</br>  <br>The "Miki is a slut" meme.<br>She's a pure girl and I won't stand bullying like this.</br></br>  <br>If she wore it to get boys horny, why would she wear it when alone, trapped in a room for ages?</br>  Any good meme from today's episode?  <br>You're absolutely correct</br>  Why is  every  girl best girl?  so if they skipped skin shedding chapter/saving it for the blu rays, what other chapters might they skip to get in the 13 episode limit  <br> Why is   every  girl best girl?<br>Because after spamming the word "best" for so long, people have finally completely forgotten what it means.</br></br>  <br>Snake, fish, and spider are the only ones I don't hate.<br><br>Bird is too retarded, Slime betrayed my expectations when I'm used to the ones from MGQ, and Horse is just fucking disgusting. <br><br>This is coming from a girl who usually likes the knight-girl archetype</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if skin shedding is in the BD I will fucking buy it.</br>  what was Suu doing to Papi in that short?<br><br>why was Papi naked in the front room?</br></br>  4 down two more to go.  <br> Why is every girl best girl? <br>Because you have no standard.</br></br>  <br>Because you have no taste.</br>  <br>MON and exercising.</br>  <br>fine, every girl is best girl expect for rachnera<br>you happy?</br></br>  <br> MON <br>its in their ED, they can't just skip them</br></br>    <br>what edition is this.</br>  <br>Considering their roll in the Rachnee chapter, we will get MON eventually. I'm just having trouble seeing them spend half an episode just for the MON chapter.<br><br>Maybe the Lala thing will be resolved by Ep.12, and they can devote an full episode to MON shenanigans.</br></br></br>  <br>Darling is best girl though.</br>  <br> Roll <br><br>Role.<br><br>Damn lightheadedness...</br></br></br></br></br>  Devil would be perfect  if she wasn't a crazy bitch   <br> no Sumizu-san <br>Best girl isnt there.<br> Rachnee is close tho </br></br></br>  <br>Same as Dracosa would be perfect if she wasn't a blond dyke.<br><br>Almost sounds like a jingle...<br> What would you do-oo-oo... </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Trying to avoid starting waifu wars right off the bat <br> People offended that I didn't start waifu wars </br></br></br>  <br> realize that Miia can perform paizuri on herself </br>  I want to be dominated by dominated by Rachnera  <br>We all do anon.</br>  <br>You keep forgetting about Dullahan.

I don't remember exactly) <br><br> * Naruto gets mad at Konohamaru <br><br> * Boruto reminds him that it's an important day. He slams his fists on the desk.  <br><br> * Boruto tells Naruto something like 'If you forget my little sister's birthday...I won't forgive you!' </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> we can only have anime threads about the ones I like </br>  <br>They really couldn't pick a better name for his kid?<br><br>like is no one original anymore? they could have named him virtually any metaphorical meaning in japanese under the sun, but no it had to be 'boruto'</br></br></br>  <br> how many episodes of One Piece are there? <br><br>704 so far. It was good pre-timeskip but after that the anime started catching up and the pacing got so bad. Half of an episode would be a recap of the previous episode and there would only be like 4-5 min of new content. The animation quality is also complete trash. You can Toei doesn't give a fuck becuase retarded Otaku keep buying OP DVDs regardless of how many still frames and QUALITY there is. It's just so bad now it's not even watchable except for the movies and specials. Better to stick to the manga which is vastly superior.</br></br></br>  <br>It's actually a nice name.<br>Ends in -TO like his father's and grandfather's and is a reference to his uncle Neji</br></br>  <br>It does have metaphorical meaning. Boruto is the loanword for bolt, referencing Neji, which means screw, and follows the tradition Minato -&gt; Nagato -&gt; Naruto -&gt; Boruto</br>  <br>Sounds too much like Naruto, the rhyming turns me off really</br>  <br>well the key suffix thats getting me is "-ruto"<br><br>I get the -to part but the conjunction -ruto is a lot more similar<br><br>minato&gt;nagato&gt;naruto doesn't give me that same ring however Nartuto&gt;boruto just sound way too similar</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> /a/ is a safe space for me and my shit taste <br>Fuck off, this is the logic that killed /v/.</br></br>  <br> You can Toei doesn't give a fuck becuase retarded Otaku keep buying OP DVDs regardless of how many still frames and QUALITY there is. <br>TV ratings are more important for mainstream anime, Naruto and One Piece don't sell many DVDs unless it's a movie.</br></br>  MODS SERIOUSLY FUCKING DELETED ALL THE DUBS POSTS AND LOLI DUMPS<br><br>HOLY SHIT, THAT HORSEFUCKER MOD REALLY IS RUINING THE PLACE.</br></br>  <br>No its not, /v/ was rampant with General threads so /v/ got /vg/ for all the generals</br>  <br>Based mod.</br>  <br> he doesn't realize /a/ is just as shit as /v/ </br>  <br><br>Read Rock Lee Gaiden that came out awhile back<br><br>Gai Sensei isn't handicapped by the wheelchair at all, he's in fact made a life out of proving the only handicap is in your mind, so as long as you have guts and youth you'll never say die.<br><br>Only problem is the bone in his right leg is damaged anyway. His other leg is just fine.<br><br>Its said that his friends still treat him as he's the same guy and still believe him to be the super top class ninja, so in order to live up to those expectations he's made it his mission to never give up and prove this can't even be called a loss for a guy like this.<br><br>Rock Lee at one point looks up and sees Gai on top of a building with his wheelchair, wondering how he got up there since there weren't any ramps or anything and it should be impossible, before he perfectly jumps off and down towards Lee.<br><br>Gai isn't disappointing anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm late to the anime talkback discussion. What was /a/'s general opinion of Gai V Madara?  <br>Well the normal OP DVDs sell a couple thousand, but those Log Collections hit 10k every time they come out. But yeah OP ratings are still insanely high for how bad the anime is.</br>  <br>She technically was all along since she was the original heir, they only bumped her down after she was nearly kidnapped by clouds and lost to someone younger than herself.<br><br>In the Last Movie she regained her title in a sense, when Hamera calls her the Byakugan Princess and gives her an upgrade power. Turns out she was very mildly super special all along, but not in an up front way. Like Naruto she still had to train all the way up before being told "Yeah, actually you're a bit special".</br></br></br>  <br>At this rate, i'm willing to believe it<br><br> both have SJW mods <br> both delete shitposting to attract casuals and plebeians  <br> both delete OC because "they want to stay on topic" <br> both got fucked horribly by moot  <br><br>The only difference is that people haven't started thinking that were /b/ with anime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>#ModsAreFags #AnimeWasAMistake</br>  <br> both have SJW mods <br>thats a meme, off topic threads have always been deleted, suddenly you had a name to call it and now its some kind of special thing<br> both delete shitposting to attract casuals <br>thats the opposite of what deleting off topic shitposts does.<br> delete OC because they want to stay on topic <br>what?<br> got fucked horribly by moot <br>such as?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It was a cool what if idea.

Everyone explained why CoD is shit and told them to fuck off, making all the kids piss themselves. The mods flat out deleted every single negative post in that thread, leaving it to only children discussing Cowie Dooties. Shitposting may be shit, but by god its fucking necessary for keeping quality. <br><br> what? <br>Fun threads are deleted instantly, no fun allowed.<br><br> got fucked horribly by moot <br>See reasons one and two.
