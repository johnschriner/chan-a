The new ORC, the DxD team, Issei's entire harem etc.<br><br>Make it happen Miyama.</br></br>    <br> the DxD team <br>this would be pretty cool , also yeah one of the current harem woud be nice considering its been a while sinse we have seen it all together.<br> full harem in wedding dresses and issei in a tux in the middle of them <br> Kuroka, Sona and Yumi running in the back ground with wedding dresses in their arms trying to get to where the picture is being taken </br></br></br></br>  <br> still no Le Fay <br>Wait a sec, I don't recall King Arthur has any children, is this from the Morgana Le Fay?</br></br>    Anyone feel that the series went downhill after vol 16?  <br>I liked the invasion of Heaven. But did not like when Crom switched sides. Sure he wasn't Rizevims bitch an all out fight against Issei was going to be so badass</br>  <br>But now you get to have Crom as Issei's mentor.</br>  <br>Isn't forbidden for harem's side characters to get a girlfriend for having all the girls available to MC?</br>  <br>No, Issei ships Tsubaki to Kiba and Sona to Saji, Saji too has two girls after him in canon.<br>As for Vali he did it to himself, Kuroka already stated she would go to live in Issei house and that's the result of DxD Ex.<br>Pretty sure Valerie loved Gasper instead of Issei too.</br></br></br>  <br>How do you pronounce Cao Cao?</br>  <br>K-ah-oh K-ah-oh?</br>  <br>It doesn't sound chinese at all</br>  <br> Gasper (Valerie) <br> Kiba (Tsubaki, Tosca in the future maybe?) <br> Sairaorg (Kuisha) <br> Saji (Momo and Ruroko) </br></br></br></br>  Participated in the current raid event out of curiosity and for hoarding purposes.

For real, the problem with her is that she doesnt stand out in any way, at least Maikaze has the dance thing.<br>Also the desdiv thing is just because she was drawn with a different artist, things would be really different if she was a Yoshirnori ship, at least thats what I believe.</br></br>  <br>Atago giving Takao confused boatboners.</br>  <br>They definitely would, at the very least you'd see the four of them together for promotional art instead of shoehorning Shimakaze in there.</br>  I really am not surprised that every time actual yurifags show up in kancolle thread instead of yurispammers bait show, they act retarded.  <br>Yukikaze a qtkaze.</br>  <br>You're right of course, but that doesn't make it any less unfortunate.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127989023 <br>The name of the system is what was called temporary, and they stuck with it.<br>Retard.</br></br>  <br>cursed ship</br>  <br>I wish luck actually mattered for more things.</br>  Do indos even qualify as people?  <br>Anyone who sinks ships for just 2k DMM points can't be considered a person.</br>  <br>Hey watch it you limey</br>    need more lady.  <br> Ruled by the Dutch for three and a half centuries.  <br>Not at all. <br><br> Why am I posting Haguro? </br></br></br></br>  Not a yurifag but that was adorable  <br> boat </br>  <br>Because Haguro is the best CA.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127989259 <br> still temporary  <br>It's not<br> when gamemaker have good money they remove and turn game into what they want in first place <br>Yurifags, everyone</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her in-game sprite doesn't do her justice.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127989259 <br> anime show that yuri get more successful </br>  <br>I don't even understand what the fuck he's saying anymore.

There are far worse sprites in the game.<br>But yeah she's the most qt.</br></br>  I FUCKING LOOOOOOOVE YUKIKAZE!  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127989259 <br> still temporary <br> when gamemaker have good money they remove and turn game into what they want in first place <br><br>So since there's no such thing as enough money then that means they'll never get rid of it? Gotcha.<br><br>Also, what makes the anime more canon than any of the other official works that can't even agree with each other over certain story issues or personalities?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes but there is another reason. It's a bit obscure, but it was related to my post.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127988175 <br>As a yurifag myself, I think the game has plenty of blatant, in-your-face yuri content, no need to be upset. Besides, from a business standpoint, it's easier to get more money and a stable group of players from single otaku dudes. The same reason why idol groups don't allow public dating: fans wouldn't play so much or spend so much without the self insert content.</br>  I cannot sexualize Yukikaze at all.  I think Yukikaze would've been a much better MC than Fubuki, but at the same time I'm glad she wasn't the MC because the anime would've ruined her.  <br> plenty of blatant, in-your-face yuri content <br> plenty </br></br>  <br>Then what's her pseudonym(s) for eroge?</br>  <br>北川ちんちん</br>  <br><br>The only time I've found her sexual is in the Yukimi manga where Tokitsukaze is a slut and Yukikaze just goes with it.</br></br>    <br>Me neither.</br>  <br><br>Look at more R-18 art.</br></br>  <br>I can.</br>  <br>Why would I do that?</br>  <br><br>Why wouldn't you do that?</br></br>  For some reason Yukikaze underperforms quite hard here.  <br>Did you type this wrong?</br>  <br>The cutest for me</br>  TSUKURU TSUKURU  <br>Your luck is bottlenecking her luck.</br>  <br><br>There's better Kazes to fap to.</br></br>  <br>GF Kari CM turned into yandere ship kari.</br>  <br> marrying a low res .PNG <br>I am so jealous right now</br></br>  <br>Yukikaze has cleared more event maps for me using her torpedos of maximum crit than I can remember.

On one side I don't want anyone to sexualize Yukikaze but on the other I don't think any other kaze can even compare to the Yukes.</br>  <br>secondary, pls</br>  <br>For real though, Yukikaze has great stats. What do you have her equipped with?</br>  <br>yuki and toki are good pairing<br><br>like to see more</br></br></br>  <br><br>The cutest things are usually also the most fappable things.</br></br>  <br><br>Yukikaze for huggable cute, Tokitsukaze for lewd cute.</br></br>  <br>For the most part I agree, but Yukikaze is an exception.</br>  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/787924/56a189<wbr>ef02/<br><br>It's hard to pick a favorite KanColle doujin but this is definitely up there.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>I don't even remember that this bitch exists until it's event time and she starts dropping for people.</br>  <br> 3rd and 4th panels <br><br>im so fucking hard</br></br></br>  <br>Toki, Amatsu and Iso are my favourite Kazes</br>  <br>lolicon admiral creeps me out</br>  <br>meant to quote<br/></br>  <br><br>His Tenryuu one is good too.

And yes, events are that good to play because of event only ships, rewards, and chance of getting rarer ships to drop.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 2015 <br> still thinking that inflating HQ levels is a bad thing </br></br>  <br>It'll be daijoubu Haruna.</br>  <br>Those months of Haruna kai 2 bullying were great.</br>    Why does Kongou reject you in her marriage dialogue?  <br>She doesn't, she just tells you to calm down until it's night time before you stick it up her vagoo.</br>  <br>Kongou pegs you</br>    <br>I fucking love that artist<br><br> Breast expansion is my fetish </br></br></br>  <br>Nice fake tits, Hoteru.</br>  <br>Your fetish is disgusting.</br>    How old would you say the youngest girls in the fleet are?<br><br>Inazuma for example, how old is she?</br></br>  <br>She's not, anon. Think about it a bit.</br>  <br>i want to take a nap on em</br>  Sazanami's rabbit a shit.    <br>She's 83, youngest kanmusu right now is like 70.</br>  <br> Launched: February 25, 1932 <br>She's 83, dude.</br></br>  <br>Autist pls go</br>  <br>Older enough to be your grandma.</br>  <br><br>Depending on the artist, she can range from looking like she's 8 to 16. On average though, she's often depicted as being 10 or 12.<br><br>If you mean ACTUAL age, though,<br><br/></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>12</br></br>    <br> he thinks she's denying you </br>  <br>Looks 83 to me, officer.</br>  <br>It seems to me that she along with the rest of the Akatsukis are typically depicted to be around 10.</br>  <br><br>That probably wouldn't hold up in court.</br></br>  <br>Her birth certificate certainly will.</br>  <br>She's saying the timing is not good, aka she likes you but is not ready to commit to marriage. It's a common rejection to marriage proposals.</br>  <br>That's not what she's saying, anon.<br>Listen to the way she says it.</br></br>  <br>How does talking about the wrong mood equate to not being ready to commit to marriage?</br>  <br>Pretty sure she has a death certificate too. Coincidentally, they are charging you with necrophilia.</br>  <br>The death certificate of someone who's clearly alive won't hold up in court.</br>  <br>No, she is saying "just wait till later so I can passionately fuck you over it"</br>  Which kaze is best kaze?  <br>Yuki</br>  <br>Urakaze.</br>  <br>Amatsukaze</br>  <br>Shimakaze</br>  <br>Ura</br>  <br>Hatsukaze</br>  Abukuma Kai 2 has been 100% confirmed now.   I want off this grind.   <br><br>When the fuck will Inazuma and Samidare get a kai-ni</br></br>  <br>Samidare will be the last of the starters to get it since she's the only non Special Type Destroyer.</br>  <br> Inazuma <br>Eventually<br> Samidare <br>Never</br></br></br></br>  <br>Isokaze.<br><br>Amatsukaze close second.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Unfair.</br></br></br>  <br> For a moment, I thought this was the /wowsg/ thread, and you were complaining about the awful Furutaka-&gt;Aoba grind. </br>  <br>Saber</br>  <br> I thought I was there as well.  <br>Too late now.</br></br>  <br>Kai 2 couldn't save Furutaka from being god awful.</br>  <br>Inazuma not sure, but Samidare will get hers with Suzukaze.</br>  <br>No Isokaze smug, no life</br>  <br>It's okay, I get confused too.</br>   Wanting more of Yadokari's new shittier art style <br>I'm all for giving Inazuma a kai ni, just not with Yadokari's art style.</br>  <br>I quite like Akatsuki Kai Ni, but that's probably because I was expecting much worse.</br>  <br> just not with Yadokari's art style. <br>So you want her to never get a kai 2? Because there's no way they'll replace the artist. And Akatsuki's kai 2 is a lot better than it could have been considering some of Yadokari's promotional art.</br></br>  <br>It made her prettier and that's what matters.</br>  Who cares how shit her kai ni sprite looks, all that matters is that she gets better stats than Shitbuki since Inazuma is a Type III and Shitbuki is a Type I.  <br>To be fair, it's not hard to make her prettier when her regular art is a monstrosity.</br>  Akashi is so fucking cute.  <br> You all come <br>You all came<br><br><br> What that <br>What's that<br><br><br>Think there was a note about Takao and the leaves.<br><br><br> Speaking of Next <br>Speaking of Next Year...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're both extremely cute.

I think this is the first time I've seen Nao in color in the manga.</br>  I want to know what he's planning.  <br>Man, this really looks nice in color.</br>  Where was Hisako during this exchange?<br>And what was Megumi thinking here?</br>  <br>Hand was Hishoko, calling it now.</br>  <br>The coloured version always makes me hungry.</br>  Who's the mystery person? What is Souma planning? Ahhhh!  <br>Hisako is undoubtedly running store clean up and prep work while Erina was away. Similar to Isami and Kanichi.<br><br><br>Hand looked about the same size as Souma's not like a girl's. Maybe barring Houjou.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably prepping Erina's booth, like Isami and Don-senpai were doing Takumi and Nikumi.<br><br>Looks more like a man's hand.</br></br></br>  <br>In my opinion Shokugeki no Soma has the best color version of all Jump manga.</br>  <br>Is that supposed to be an actor to play her? Because that casting is terrible for every reason imaginable</br>  <br>No matter how less their odds of collaboration and winning is they will certainly work it out<br>   Shonen genre manga <br>   Plot armor for every relevant character </br></br></br>  <br>I can't wait for the next chapter, I'm getting hype.</br>  <br> was it rape? </br>  <br>Is that Giganigga lending him his motorcycle?</br>  <br>People keep saying she has a man jaw, maybe it's related to that.</br>  <br>Souma's the one handing over the key. Note the sleeve. Giganig has bigger hands anyway.</br>  Do you think Hayama will give up on Jun and find a girl his age?  <br>Well it seems to be inside the polar dorm, so its probably Isshiki.</br>  <br>Megumi looks better with her hair down and I'm not a big fan of hers either.</br>  Erina losing everything in a shokugeki and finding redemption/healing by joining PSD arc when?  <br>I think it's supposed to be the door to the dorms.</br>  <br>Again as mentioned<br>   Shonen genre manga <br>   Plot armor for every relevant character </br></br></br>  <br> She's your mother, not your waifu. </br>  <br>I bet this is Eizan.</br>  <br>That silhouette is looking pretty bald, maybe it's one of Yugi's sluts?</br>  <br><br>It's Smoke.</br></br>  <br>That's a pretty normal thing with silhouettes to preserve some mystery.</br>  <br>Erina looks like Takumi i.e. a man</br>    <br>It's Takumi that looks like a girl.  Best girl. </br>  <br>Takumi a cute.</br>  <br>It's Saitama</br>  IS IT THEORYCRAFTING TIME?<br><br>Is soma trying to give away free food? If so, and by changing up the menu is he trying to build anticipation for his cart everyday and cultivate a fanbase of 'regulars'?</br></br>  <br>BAMF</br>  <br>It may really be him!</br>  <br>2nd year or end of first year</br>  <br>Doesn't Smoke not like Souma very much though?</br>  <br>imblying</br>  <br>Why do girls like effeminate men? It's not even anime-only thing, look at all those super popular Korean pop-singers who have thousand of fangirls despite being more feminine than most of those fangirls themselves.</br>  <br>Isami nicest boy (along with Isshiki)<br><br>all that weight fluctuating must be hell on his liver though</br></br></br>  <br>Free food for a sales/profit contest, how Yukihira of him</br>  Can't wait to see the aromatic seafood curry made with molecular gastronomy technique.  <br>What makes you say that? Ibusaki is a bro to everyone in the PSD and was cheering for Soma throughout the Autumn Elections.<br><br>He sees Soma, Megumi and Isshiki as rivals though and feels he's falling too far behind.</br></br></br>  <br> Isami nicest boy <br>I agree. I'm happy that Isami's got a fanclub of his own now.</br></br>  <br>That's the exact sort of out-of-the-box thinking we need!</br>  I'm looking forward to the turn-around of Alice, Hayama, and Kuro in a hilarious and satisfying fashion. Along with Soma and Megumi.  <br>It would be his leftovers anyway.<br><br><br>There's some research on this that shows a correlation between high health/standard of living, and how attractive a woman finds effeminate men.<br><br>Basically, the poorer and less healthy (like in the 3rd world) a woman would be the more she'd find a really masculine guy attractive. While the richer and healthier she becomes, the more she starts to gravitate towards the effeminate.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Smoke got seriously shafted in Autumn election<br>I mean, I know that Megumi had an arc about becoming self-assured, but Smoke had been hyped as a prodigy who was already resolved and level headed</br></br>  <br> smoke had been hyped as a prodigy <br>when</br></br>  <br>LN.</br>  <br>lol</br>  Could Mimasaka outsmoke smoke?  Do Aldinis have any specialization aside from "Italian cuisine"? Like Shinomiya cooks French cuisine, but his specialization is vegetables.  <br>Not really<br>They are Italian Souma and Italian Megumin~</br></br>  Smoke's LN story seemed to suggest he was a big fish in a small pond until he came to the large pond of totsuki and realized how small he was in comparison. So he's very frustrated.  <br>That's pretty much everyone's story except the Nakiris though.</br>  <br>Alice's group barely breaks even and Soma does better<br><br>some things don't mix</br></br></br>  <br>Smoke will be job to Ryou/ Subaru/ Akira anyway even if he gets to Top 8.<br>Unless Souma wrecked Subaru in the round of 8, the top 4 will always be Souma, Subaru, Akira and Ryou.</br></br>  <br>Could Mitsubishi beat Alice?</br>  I heard some niggers were talking shit about Erina?  <br>All Smoke has to do is realise he loves best girl  Ryouko <br><br>Then he'll become at the least an S rank cook</br></br></br>  Fucking casanova when?  <br>Tomorrow.</br>  <br>that's what they said yesterday and the day before that</br>  <br>They usually release the chapter at monday.</br>  <br>Don't mind those plebs, keep posting more Erina.</br>  <br>Yesterday you said tomorrow.</br>  <br>If Souma had fought Subaru in round one, Subaru would have won. Souma was only able to evade his trick by knowing about it beforehand.</br>  <br>Things are done whe they're anon, just read shitscans or wait for Viz   or you can just fuck off for the time being  </br>    <br> He didn't get it </br>  <br>Why do people like her?</br>  <br>Why not? She's becoming less bitchy around Soma</br>  <br> Implying I want to get your stupid joke. </br>  I want to dance with megumi so badly.<br><br>I've been losing sleep over it. fucking christ I really want her. please just take her yukihira soma so I can move on with my life</br></br>  <br>It's called not having shit taste<br><br>You should try it some time</br></br></br>  <br>Go to bed Hinako.</br>  <br> beautiful <br> perfect cook <br> non violent tsundere <br> secretly innocent manga lover </br></br></br></br>  <br>That's enough... too far</br>  Here's a thought:<br><br>Remember that trope in battle manga where you show how strong a new character is by making him beat the previous top dog?<br><br>Remember how we still know little about the rest of the Elite 10, especially the top 3?<br>What if, they plan to show #1's specialty by letting him beat Erina publicly?<br><br>Then we can go into full desfrost mode with </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What would Nikumi think of my chicken??  <br>why don't you just throw it in the mixer to begin with if you're making slime?</br>  <br> medium-cooked chicken breast </br>  <br> Soma said something <br> Erina looked back in disdain <br> Erina said something <br> Some dryly shot back <br>Man, these 2 are just good foils to each other, it's turning me into a shipfag.</br></br></br></br></br>  It's shit.

The whole earth is now a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Everything but them is dead.  <br>Yui is an immortal space god, she isn't dead because the Eva can never die; she literally exists as the proof humanity has existed. She's the only one who got exactly what she wanted, and the best part is she planned it all from the start.</br>  <br>Yui implies people will come back, I assume this means plants and animals as well since they are also lilin.</br>  <br>Did you even pay attention to the ending?</br>  <br>Basically they're Líf and Lífþrasir.</br>  <br>99% sure asuka &amp; shinji don't stay there forever</br>  <br>They'll feast on Rei's giant head for sustenance.</br>  <br>it's just SYMBOLISM, they get instrumentalized like everyone else and go wherever they go</br>  <br> Flowers, so many the same, so many without purpose  <br><br>I think you need to retake middle school biology Rei</br></br></br>  <br>Watching Chobits, it reminds me of this scene.</br>  Remember son, if you don't get in the robot I won't love you anymore.  <br>im being a bit too analytical but from how she said "so many the same" i took it that "so many without purpose" means that there are so many flowers that are the same, that one can be removed and be easily replaced.</br>  <br>Rei is kinda mentally retarded now that I think about it</br>  "It was the best of times. It was the worst of times."  <br>Nah. She's dead and is anything but a space god.<br><br>The EVA remains there forever as proof, but it's inert and petrified, dead.<br>It's cracked and broken.<br><br>Yui didn't plan anything in NGE, she ran off into the EVA because it was her best shot and was along for the ride.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're mentally retarded for not getting what she says. It has nothing to do with biology.<br><br>This guy gets it: </br></br></br>   Y'all know me, still the same OG, but I been low key, hated on by most these niggas with no cheese    Post more cute Rei   <br>Rei Q isn't Rei, just FYI.</br>  <br>Cute Rei.</br>  <br>Her soul is shown moving inside of it at the end of the movie. She's alive and immortal, just like she wanted. Yui won.</br>   Oh yeah <br>  What it's like <br>  Havin' a Roni <br>  What it's like <br>  Havin' a Roni <br><br>-Vanilla Rei</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Her soul is shown moving inside of it at the end of the movie. <br>wut?<br><br>She's dead or at best trapped inside an EVA.<br><br>She won if you find it OK to be stuck forever, but that qualifies as losing in the real world.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>The cutest Rei is Rei from the series.<br><br><br>She's not alive if she' stuck in an EVA. What you call winning I call losing, she's an eternal prisoner.<br><br>She's just practicing the good ol' "anywhere can be paradise" thing so that she won't go insane the first few years of solitude or so.<br><br>Then it wears off and she's fucked.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>うん</br>  <br> wut? <br>Watch the movie again, towards the end when Yui says something along the lines of "As long as the moon stars and sun exist, everything will be alright" we see her soul flowing within the Eva, she's alive and immortal and exists in some manner as the proof of humanity's existence. In this case, she won because this is what she wanted to begin with; and planned her way to achieve it.<br><br><br> she's an eternal prisoner <br>She doesn't consider herself a prisoner, she considers herself the very representation of humanity's existence. In her eyes, she won and got what she wanted. She's pretty much the only Eva character who got what she wanted.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Most memorable Reifag quotes </br>  <br> She doesn't consider herself a prisoner, she considers herself the very representation of humanity's existence <br><br>Like I said, she's doing the "anywhere can be paradise" thing.<br><br>Stop pretending Yui gets any good end by lowering the expectations to absolute fucking zero.<br><br>Getting what you want doesn't always mean you end up well or as good as you can have been.<br><br>Yui is a character so poorly developed that "what she wanted" is more or less all she is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most of those are Asukafag quotes.<br><br>If praising Re-take doesn't tip you off, then nothing will.</br></br></br>  <br> Man fears the darkness, and so he scrapes away at the edges of it with fire.  <br><br>Compared to <br> ANTA BAKA!? <br>and <br> I mustn't run away! <br>I'd say she has some of the better stuff.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw no qt emotionless natsoc waifu </br>    <br>It's the same, petrified EVA we see anon. We know Yui is inside it.<br><br>Let me repeat myself:<br> She won if you find it OK to be stuck forever, but that qualifies as losing in the real world. <br><br>Plus she didn't plan anything at all. She just got into the EVA because it would give her better chances than staying alive would. That part is in the TV-series, Fuyutsuki has been threatened on his life if he's uncooperative, and the same goes for all members of this elite cabal.<br><br><br>I don't get why this is passed around as "reifag" quotes when it's obviously Asukafags complaining about Sadamoto being a Reifag, and bitching that there's too little Shinji x asuka.<br><br>You can smell the passive aggressiveness, like "it's a trainwrecky incest quest" or lameting that Rebuild seems to be Reifag route.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> LRS is huge in Japan <br>Every fucking time. The hilarious part is even fucking Asuka x Kaworu has more art and doujinshi than that dead ship does now.</br></br>  <br>Double trips speak the objective truth.</br>  <br>see <br><br>Some of them are obviously Reifags, but the only ones really occupied with shipping are Asuka fans and Kaworu fans, which is why most of the ship-talk on /a/ at least doesn't concern Reifags unless there's massive criticism of it.<br><br>Back in the good old days (at least for a few years) shipping was not accepted.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And the soul is still within. Petrified or not, she ain't dead. She's existing in some way or form and she's loving it because she knew exactly that would be the result.<br><br>Why are you so mad? Because Yui got what she wanted and you're waifu didn't? She played the game, nigga. You're waifu just got played instead.</br></br></br>  <br> And the soul is still within. Petrified or not, she ain't dead. She's existing in some way or form and she's loving it because she knew exactly that would be the result. <br><br>Now you're making up stuff. Loving it? Really?<br>This is going beyond reason, can't you just drop your dumb pet theory?</br></br></br></br>  <br> but the only ones really occupied with shipping are Asuka fans and Kaworu fans <br>Because they're the only ones who have any legitimacy and evidence for their ship, you retard. Shinji hardly ever interacted with Rei in the original series and didn't even sexualize her like he did with Misato and Asuka, hence why he never blushed at her. She was just another mommy clone and that's why no one fucking ships them together. They are pretty much a crackpairing.</br></br>  <br> Loving it? Really? <br>She's pretty happy about it. Even that talk with Fuyutsuki at the beginning of the movie with Shinji in her arms proves how fucked up she is. Sorry that Yui being the mastermind who won the Eva gets your panties in such a twist.</br></br>  <br> Why are you so mad? Because Yui got what she wanted and you're waifu didn't? She played the game, nigga. You're waifu just got played instead. <br><br>Now you're clearly just shitposting.<br><br>If you're waifu wanted to suffer or be tortured, and she gets it, does it mean she really gets a good ending or even a well made one? Not at all.<br><br>If by setting your "goals" so low that they'll be met regardless of what you do, or most of what anyone else does then you can't really cheer for having achieved them.<br><br>I miss the days when we could talk about Evangelion seriously instead of having dumbasses like you talk about it like it's a game.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Since you're clearly not a Rei fan but one of the others, then I think my point is made. You're obsessed with shipping and treat it like your personal turf.<br><br>You guys are a joke.</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=AEJ<wbr>7My5us28</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> If you're waifu wanted to suffer or be tortured, and she gets it, does it mean she really gets a good ending or even a well made one <br>Yes, because by her standards that's a good ending. She doesn't consider it torture, she considers being the representation for humanity a great honor and role. Her talk with Fuyu and the fact that she wanted to show Shinji her death seals it. She's fucked up, but she won nonetheless. Hail Yui-sama.</br></br>  <br>She seems monotone and uncaring if anything, considering her TV-appearance and EoE appearance in the flashbacks she actually seems resigned.<br><br>Being stuck inside an EVA as it's prisoner isn't winning, I'm sorry if pointing out how dumb your whole idea about "winning the EVA" is gets your panties in a twist.<br><br>Why can't you grow up?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yes, because by her standards that's a good ending.  <br><br>Yui isn't real and her standards are so abysmally low she doesn't even qualify as a contestant to this would be "game".<br><br>You remind me of some other disgusting autist I heard about one, some evageeks cretin who uniorinically says things like "yui-sama".</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Unit 01 was only like that briefly when Yui's soul left it to talk to Shinji during instrumentality and to talk shit to Gendo and inform him how much of a bitch ass faggot he was to Shinji.<br><br>Then the phantom of 01 uses him for a chicken mcnugget.<br><br>ALso Unit 01 is clearly active at the very end of EoE.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure some retard like you would consider being raped to death a "honorful role", doesn't change the fact that you're getting raped to death.<br><br>You literally have to be crazy to consider this a good ending or winning, and if your argument is that either you or Yui are crazy, then fine, go ahead.<br><br>But Evangelion isn't a game you win in the first place, and the criteria you have for winning it is so bad that pretty much anyone qualified at one point.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She seems monotone and uncaring if anything <br>Nice fanwank. The happy tone in her voice is obvious, she's actually super elated when she says "You don't need to worry". <br> Being stuck inside an EVA as it's prisoner isn't winning <br>According to Yui, it is. She got what she wanted. She was the only one to get what she wanted (save for SEELE, I guess?). She won.<br> Why can't you grow up? <br>Says the one who after all these years is still emotionally attached to a children's cartoon show, to the point of using it to escape reality. You're the one who needs to grow up, you literal manchild.<br><br><br> some evageeks cretin who uniorinically says things like "yui-sama" <br>How would you even know something retarded like that unless you were a Evageeks frequent yourself? Fuck off back to that hellhole.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's like that all the way to the end actually.<br><br>Of course it's active in EoE, but then it stops being active and returns to a motionless slab of petrified EVA.<br>Yui is inside that, and she's trapped there. Forever. Alone.<br><br>You can say it's what she wanted all you want, but it's still not something that you'd envy or consider winning.<br><br>Hell by your logic, SEELE won, Rei won, Kaworu won, Shinji won because they get something they want out of this mess.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If the one getting raped wanted it, then them getting raped is getting what they want. This isn't rocket science, dumbass. Yui got what she want, so she 'won'. Stop being autistic over a simply word.</br>  <br>Yui is going to regret the whole eternity in space thing pretty fast.</br>  <br>Everyone knows because you actually need to be a power-weeb and an evageek to say shit like that. <br><br><br>It's not rocket science that Yui is an eternal do-nothing until she explodes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The soul moving in the Eva is shown after the petrified unit scene. <br> but it's still not something that you'd envy or consider winning <br>Who cares? In the end, it's what she wanted. Be happy for her.</br></br></br>  <br> and an evageek to say shit like that <br>And how would you know what an Evageek talks like? Again, go fuck off back there if you know them so well.</br></br>  <br> Nice fanwank. The happy tone in her voice is obvious, she's actually super elated when she says "You don't need to worry".  <br>Yeah, in reference to Shinji, the only instance. The rest is monotone.<br><br> According to Yui, it is. She got what she wanted. She was the only one to get what she wanted (save for SEELE, I guess?). She won. <br>She didn't win any-fucking thing anon. She's stuck there doing nothing. DIdn't even get to live her life or raise her son, which is what her main motivation is.<br><br>The whole being stuck at the end there is just how things ended up.<br><br> Says the one who after all these years is still emotionally attached to a children's cartoon show, to the point of using it to escape reality. You're the one who needs to grow up, you literal manchild. <br><br>Holy hell this level of projection. Did you just describe yourself there? If you know how pathetic you are, can't you just grow up then?<br><br>Otherwise why are you so desperate to say "yui won" when all she did was literally nothing? SEELE won, Misato won, Kaworu won, Rei won, everyone's a winner because all we consider winning is a single thing they want to get done.<br><br>Grow up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It is a little less petrified at the end. <br><br>And probably extremely old.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't get mad at me just because no one wants to ship your crackship. LRS isn't a thing because the show doesn't make it a thing. LAS and Kawoshin are things because the show makes them things. It's that simple, no need to soil your tampon over it.</br>  <br> The soul moving in the Eva is shown after the petrified unit scene.  <br>We know Yui is in there. The EVA is petrified.<br><br> Who cares? In the end, it's what she wanted. Be happy for her. <br>How about you get realistic, since this isn't your fantasy dream show. She's trapped there. Forever. Regretful last words are those, I tell you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Double trips confirm LAK is the new OTP?</br>  <br>Same level of petrified.</br>  <br><br>Yui won.</br></br>  <br>I don't ship, but obviously you do. You have some serious problems if you feel this threatened by something that according to yourself isn't really a thing.<br><br><br><br>That looks petrified to me.<br><br>If Yui gets to be destroyed when the sun blows up, then I don't really envy her, and after a week or a month she'll be going crazy. <br><br>Either way she's eternally stagnant, so by EVA's standard that the whole "eternal bliss" thing, she loses the most of all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How the fuck are Shinji and Asuka even supposed to keep on living? The whole earth is now a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Everything but them is dead. <br>LCL is nutritious and available in almost limitless quantities.</br></br>  <br>The loser lottery maybe.</br>  <br> I don't ship, but obviously you do <br>Pointing out what actually happens in the show is not shipping. Rather, you're the one who responded to the post in the first place; good going in proving how butthurt you are.</br></br>  <br> drinking liquified humans <br>Ehh</br></br>  <br>Oooh, what do I win?<br><br> You get to be the beacon of humanity! <br><br>Yaaay! That suits me just fine!<br><br> So you'll stay inside the EVA as the beacon, and it'll be fine unless the sun goes supernova. <br><br>Wait what? <br><br> Yeah, when it inevitably goes boom, you also go boom. <br><br>But that's like billions of years, there's plenty of time to go away<br><br> Eh, as the beacon of humanity you won't be going anywhere actually.

You're waifu lost and is miserable.</br></br>  <br>I responded because the posters in the image are clearly Asuka fans, not Rei fans...?</br>  Row Row fight the Powa!  <br>Mai waifu is SEELE, Rei and Kaworu.<br><br>SEELE was absolutely elated and happy, Rei got to reunite with Lilith and gave Gendo the middle finger, and Kaworu got to kill himself.<br><br>Mai waifus &gt; your soon-to-be insane-and-wishing-she-was-dead waifu.<br><br> seriously, you waifufags are pathetic. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Imagine future humans getting a signal from Unit-01 and it's just that last bit in every language she knew.</br>  <br><br>Not the guy you're arguing with, but if you think Yui didn't get exactly what she wanted, you're misunderstanding the story. <br><br>All the events in Evangelion are precipitated from the moment Yui trapped herself within Unit 01. It is subtlety inferred, that once this event occurs a set series of more or less calculated events began with no deviance possible. She predicted essentially every action through some form of genius (being a scientist/having access to the Magi/something comparable). She desired happiness for Shinji and what was best for humanity above all else. Ultimately everything she did was done in order to raise Shinji to the Throne of Souls and put him in charge of Instrumentality, so that the soul of a child who knew the pain of the absense of love (truly the only person then who could appreciate love) could decide what was best for humanity. <br><br>DESPITE EVERYTHING Shinji decides it is better to live than to return to the primordial soup and superconsciousness. There is reason and meaning here, and it all starts with a mother's undying love for her child.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fine, Yui won because she had no goals in life and did nothing. Wow, what a strong message this sends to the youth of today.</br>  Discuss  <br>Im still mad that the OST didn't have explicit anime soundtrack</br>  <br>Great, I've been hoping for a better release for a while. Too bad we'll never get BDs.</br>  <br><br> Subtitles: .srt subs pulled from the RaX release, converted to .ass and styled. <br>They had one job. I recall seeing bits in the RaX subtitles where words had random spaces between letters and messed up punctuation even though they basically copied the KAA/official subs word for word.<br><br>Wish it were 10bit as well.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Texhnolyze sold a lot more than Lain did at first, <br><br>Really? I know the BD Box that came out a few years ago sold around 5k for Lain but I can't find any numbers for its original release. Tex only sold 1k though? Are you sure Lain's original sales were lower than that?</br></br></br>  <br>Texhnolyze was made in the unfortunate dark age of the digital transition where anime got mastered at absolute shit-tier resolutions, so the BDs would just be an upscale. Not that I don't want Texhnolyze BDs, since there'd probably be cool extras like interviews and "making of" stuff.</br>  Only 5 more months until its time to rewatch toradora again  <br>Trainwreck getting called the greatest love story ever told.<br>Don't ever seem to know if this meme is bait or genuine.</br></br>  I'm probably going to rewatch it before the annual rewatching with /a/.  PURE! PUREPARA-TO!  <br>yes it actually is op</br>  This is the greatest love story ever told.<br><br>I will internet fight people who say otherwise.</br></br>  Ami a shit  I hope this is the year that secret santa actually dies.  <br>Drop it cause It was really boring, so, did the fag mc ended up with the shitty tsundere?</br>  <br>otherwise</br>  It has been on my backlog since 2009, is it even worth watching or is it just another generic harem?  I watched this garbage three times for the first time for christmas last year, very overrated. The season half ruined the entire show.  <br>It's not a generic harem but it's a fucking train wreck so don't buy the hype.</br>  <br> I watched this garbage three times for the first time for christmas last year <br><br>:3</br></br></br>  <br>It's a one-on-one romance wherein two other girls also happen to like the protagonist, but actually consider themselves a worse fit for him than tsunRie. It's the OTP in-universe as well as out. So, no harem elements at all, really. Just two girls probably masturbating to the thought if the same guy as he falls in love with his lolifriend. It's also somewhat of a look at the differences between love and admiration. The novel is much better -- the anime changes the ending in such a manner that all character motivation and basic logic go out the window for a bit. The LN's version of the same general event makes much more sense. <br>If you are at all unsure about how it's going to go: 'Taiga' and 'Doragon' are renderings of the English Tiger and Dragon, while 'Ryuuji' amd 'Tora' take from the Japanese words for Dragon and Tiger. The show itself is as confident about the ending as the secondary characters.<br><br>Also, that fucking Christmas arc. Jesus.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you like to cry, watch it, its a tear jerker.</br>  <br>She leaves and then she comes back.<br><br>That's the entire show.<br><br>One of the worse things I've seen, but not quite THE worst.<br><br>Ruined Tsundere for me as an archetype too, which isn't too much of a bad thing since it's a pleb/normie-tier archetype anyway.<br><br>Also that's a fucking english muffin with sausage yous stupid fucking capcha.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought 3D was the normie archetype</br>  I've just finished Golden Time and why did the Author that made the perfection that is Taiga make the shit that is Kouko win?  <br><br>worth rewatching for best bro.</br></br>  <br>Lost My Pieces/10</br>  <br>It's not a harem, but it IS generic.<br><br>There are much better love stories if you're into that shit, with much better and less lazily written characters.<br><br>"Oh wow she's so tsundere right now!" is the entire show, and never actually stops being the entire show.<br><br>If you like one-dimensional romance with predictable turns and generic character interactions coupled with epic animal motifs and drama sold literally (figuratively) by the can, then  Bakemonogatari's first and second arc  Toradora is right up your alley.<br><br>Have fun with it. Its fanbase sure does.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Toradora <br> rewatch </br></br>  <br>If you're having second thoughts about watching it, i suggest you give it one more look over. It's a good show.<br>Just one more look over.<br><br> ]One more. <br><br> One more. <br><br> One more. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was trying to figure out why people like it so much. So I watched it dubbed and subbed and then one more time. The first half is good but the second half is just total rubbish.</br>  <br>Ami = best<br>Taiga = shit</br></br>  it's fun  <br>That's dedication, I suppose</br>  <br>I admit that the first half was good and it was nice. The second half just had Ryuji being a super beta and having to be forced to admit his feelings to Taiga.  That kiss at the end was fucking great though, best part of the 2nd half. </br>  I mean... Taiga isn't really a tsundere. But whatever.  <br>After time has passed, would you ever consider watching it  mou ichido? </br>  <br> Taiga <br> not tsun </br></br>  <br>I'll probably watch it again for christmas, I'd rather watch Amagami SS though. I watched that for the first time last christmas also and the last arc was the best.</br>  <br>Anon is tsundere for an anime</br>  I wouldnt rewatch the whole thing as it really drags at times<br><br>But I rewatch the kiss because muh heart</br></br>  <br>It's not like I liked the anime or anything. It could've been better.</br>  <br><br> I watched it three times in less than a month <br> I-It's not like I liked it or anything!! </br></br></br>  <br> Taiga isn't really a tsundere </br>  <br>I don't know why we don't do a rewatch of amagami every christmas, everyone seems to love it</br>  <br>When you think about it though, she only acts bitchy towards Ryuji, who she doesn't fall in love with till near the end. After that point, she stops being so cold towards him. The one she wants the whole time is Kitamura, who she never acts tsun towards. Gotta analyze those definitions before you jump on the hive mind train.</br>  <br>Generic as fuck.<br><br>Read I''s, Ai or Ichigo better if you want highschool romance.

So the latest chapter was interesting to say the least.<br><br>Keith explained a few gray areas but also created a new one, what the hell was Eren's Dad doing on the outside of the walls? Where did he come from? Was he from a human comunity outside the walls more advanced then the inside of the walls? He seemed to have had more advanced medical knowledge.</br></br>  He lived in a community that coexists with the titans. He stole some titan serum, ate a shifter, and then ran as fast as his ass could run. Once he arrived at the walls he was found by the SL and brought inside the walls. MT, knowing that Grisha probably made it inside the walls, released a plague on the inhabitants (the same plague that turned Connie's village into titans). Grisha, being a doctor that specializes in studying titans, cured the city and won the Carla bowl.  <br>BRA are from areas that have been subjugated by MT, who is carrying out the will of the First King. They were forced to go to the walls and attempt to locate Grisha, with the permission to destroy all life within the walls to do so if they must. Once they discovered that Eren had eaten him they tried to instead bring Eren back so they no longer had to kill anyone.</br>  <br>Probably related to MT and BRA. He originally invaded as a spy but he grew attached to humanity, enough to marry a human and support humanity. He obviously lied about being too drunk, he had his memories from the start.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;&gt;/v/302329013 <br><br>Come on /a/<br><br>/v/ is grieving for their hero's death.

Jack was a systematic blow out. Reiji made an effort to tear Yuya apart using Yuya's own style of play.</br>  <br>It makes sense for Shun to have this card though, like his rank ups. He said Academia was stealing their monsters.</br>  <br>Well, if he expected to go against someone arrogant from the fusion dimension like sora, who was totally into taking his shit and using it against him, it's fairly reasonable for him to have a card like that, as situational as it is otherwise.</br>  <br>We were never going to fully lose them.

All you're going to do is risk getting the thread deleted AGAIN because you can't talk about the fucking show instead of meta bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not a situational card.

They chose Ufo because they already worked on the franchise (game OPs, I think) and they also made anime for another of their franchises (Tales, which is also getting another anime by Ufo next year)<br>So they deicided to advertise the game with a TV show made by an studio that already worked for them before. Not so weird, right?</br></br>  <br><br>you realize this entire adaptation's purpose is to be a giant glorified advertisement to the remake of the first game, right?</br></br>  <br>With same regard, for the people who doesn't know, Capcom have countless merchandises for Monster Hunter like purses, handbags, handphone covers, capsule toys, kitchenware, figures, socks, jackets, comics, i.e. anything under the sun for advertising the franchise as well.</br>  DIOOOOOOOOOOO  <br/>  <br>why make an anime of the least popular MH clone though?

Does it bother you it's not your generic harem animu cheap artstyle?</br>  <br>Fuck doujins, I want official art. I want to see her animated and wrecking shit.<br>Ufotable, Hirao pls.</br></br>  I never thought I'd see the day where I complain that an anime doesn't have any anti-aliasing.  <br>why is it that everyone who liked this anime is a /v/bruh?<br><br>most of /v/ have never even played the vidya there are more /v/ bruhs in dbz threads than itt tbh</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Jesus Christ those /v/ermins crossboarders are horribly cancerous, someone do something.</br></br></br>  <br> so posterior destroyed he doesn't even read the entire post <br><br>Hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br> itt tbh <br>Stop</br></br>  So how were the first threads when the ep aired?<br><br>/a/ liked it?

No where near enough for a defense force.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's unusual because it's not 3D being postproduced to look like it does, but 2D being postproduced to look like cell shaded 3D.</br>  <br>Who gives a shit fuck about Yuu anyway, he was a blank slate <br>I just called him Daquan and made the dialog up myself<br>Then in the sequel I called him Daquan Jr</br></br></br>  I just saw the episode, and it was great.<br><br>Fuck you all.</br></br>  <br>i think the anime was good even if i never played the game imo</br>  <br>Pretty much being raided by IRC. Simply because it's a videogame adaptation.<br>Nevermind the fact that /v/ is way too normalfag to have EVER heard of God Eater or doing anything else than calling it "weebshit" if someone ever brought it up.</br></br>  <br>Again, because Bamco wanted to advertise it<br>Go cry to Capcom to get them to hire some studio to make a MH anime, MHfag<br>It's not hard to understand that Bamco would want to advertise their game with a TV show?<br> least popular <br>Maybe that's precisely why they want to advertise it with a TV show? Because it's not popular? <br>Stuff that's already popular doesn't need advertising<br>Why are you so dumb?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Do fans of the game like the artstyle?<br>Because I don't play it and thought it looked awful but maybe is just not for me.</br>  Posting glorious OSTs<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=l28<wbr>JllnZ5PE</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rT0<wbr>WpdrCJYE</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=crE<wbr>cGrcW2Xk</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=aop<wbr>qrLFgAFk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's better than the game.

The character animation is extremely choppy though, to the point some scenes look like it's just a couple FPS (like the gum scene). <br><br>The backgrounds are gorgeous, and don't look like they belong in the show. They can do some cool stuff with the characters being full CGI, but it ends up looking terrible more often than not.<br><br>The story is really bland though. I don't give a shit about any of the characters and I'm having a tough time following what is going on.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not complaining here. UFOTable doesn't look like they can do 2D well for the Aragamis.</br>   another chinese cartoon about sending emotionally-unstable teenagers to do the job trained adults should do <br> also, terribad CGI </br>  <br> characters being full CGI <br>They're 2D</br></br>  <br> Characters are full CGI <br>Stop this retarded meme. The only CGI is the aragami.</br></br>  <br> Trained adults <br>Good job finding them considering how dangerous being a GE is. Most of them don't live enough to see adulthood<br> Terribad CGI <br>The aragami looked great, faggot</br></br></br></br>  <br>instantly raided by IRC, there were no survivors</br>  <br><br>he'll die later I bet. Gotta build him up a little bit before he jobs</br></br>  <br>Second is PSO2. That makes GE in 3rd place.</br>  <br><br>So they managed to make 2D look as awful as CGI, and don't get any of the budget saving that CGI gets?<br><br>Wow, way to go GE!</br></br></br></br>  <br>why couldn't we just get this?</br>  <br><br>nigger, in the event of an apocalyptic event where titans/BETA/eotans/whatever the fuck else invade, which age demographic do you think gets killed first.</br></br>  <br> Good job finding them considering how dangerous being a GE is. Most of them don't live enough to see adulthood <br>Why not just use adults for the God Eater procedure to begin with rather than angsty teenagers?</br></br>  <br> there are more people in this picture than there are people who actually bought GE </br>  <br>How could you not tell they were 2D? It's clearly 2D with heavy digital effects</br>  <br>  <br>There's a reason, Soma was the youngest God Eater at twelve.<br><br> He's part aragami, when he came out the womb he devoured his mother, she's with him always. <br><br>The CGI/shading is shit though. I had hopes the animation would be like the previous game OPs, OVA and pachiko game.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>most studios can't into complex monster movement. The only one's left that know how are the industry veterans, and there isn't enough of them or time these days.</br></br>  <br>You wanted shading, you got it.</br>  <br>Because they decided to go with the style of the opening of the latest game (GE2RB)<br>Sorry that you dislike different artstyles<br><br>It looks great, fuck off</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seems alright. Downloaded the game to try it out on my phone.<br><br>I doubt I'll ever play it though</br></br></br>  <br>Nice repeating numerals dude, shame that the artstyle isn't as good as your triple dubs.</br>  <br>But it is like the latest game OP</br>  <br>haha ur rite lol</br>   this show looks like shit, it has too much details! <br>You fucks are crazy. Or rather, you're ignorant as hell.</br>  <br>I don't get why /v/ is the boogeyman. Every thread about this game on /v/ gets shitposted because it's not MH.</br>  I like Ufotable, but I'm honest enough to admit that the characters look bad.<br>On the other hand, the Aragamis look great, but the animation is shit and the CG just doesn't blend well with the 2D drawings.<br>The battles are underwhelming.</br></br>  <br> phone <br>wat</br></br>  Fuck you God Eater. UBW's final episodes would've been animated better if you didn't take away their budget.  <br> He think UBW wasn't top priority to the point GE got delayed 2 weeks <br>Just fuck off.</br></br>  <br>Who is this pretty young tan'g?</br>  <br> newly /v/ermin calling senpai newfag  <br><br>This is embarrassing.</br></br></br>  <br> Keep shitposting to a minimum. <br>CG shit. ufotable is finished!</br></br>  <br><br> not realizing the whole point of GE's 2 week delay was the production bottleneck on UBW episode 15 during the winter break <br><br>how about no</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why the women wearing such revealing clothes in the battlefield? Don't they think that they are 90% responsible of all the men death for distracting them while moving around with those clothes?</br></br>  <br><br>This project got massively fucked over by UBW.<br><br>I'd be glad if I was ufo/bamco that this somehow didn't end up becoming BlazBlue or Gunslinger Stratos levels of terrible</br></br></br></br>  <br> Had to cancel the advanced screening of episode 1 <br> Had to delay the actual airing a week <br>How does this situation lead you to believe that they were focusing on GE instead of UBW?</br></br></br>  Has there actually been any official comments on the approach they've taken with the animation? The coloring looks like nothing I have ever seen in any other anime, from a technical standpoint. What exactly are the production methods used?  Holy shit I just watched the episode. <br><br>What was that?<br><br>The animation looks horrible and the amount of CG almost made me throw up. The direction looked poorly made.<br><br>Why is that allowed?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lots of CGI and filters</br>  <br><br>To answer your Frodo.<br>The reason is Adult far more resistant to Oracle cell, so it's more likely wil devouring human.<br>The Adult/Retired GE like Tsubaki have their bracelet sealed to keep cell at dormant state.</br></br></br></br>  <br> What exactly are the production methods used? <br><br>rushed cgi is what they used.</br></br></br>  <br> not even new IP <br>Go away shitposter.</br></br>  <br><br>what are you talking about? 2d looking like 3d? That's a Yoshinari special. multi-tone shading?

They eat fucking everything, and got their namesake by devouring religious statues and melding with them.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>it's just how the key frames are drawn.
