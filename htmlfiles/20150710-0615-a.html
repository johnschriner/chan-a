Your wording is shit.</br>  <br><br>That's just the helmet. The black part is Iida's head.<br><br>He's fine.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br>FUCK.</br>  <br>He just got knocked back. I think you're all overreacting with this.</br>  <br>I feel more sorry for the guy whose head will no longer be attached to the rest of his body.</br>  Nah, Iida will be ok, but the the other hero will surely die and the school will put the blame on Iida, because he was aware of Stain´s modus operandi and acted with negligence.  <br>Holy fuck, all of them are fat except the one with the weird ears.<br><br>FeelsBadMan.</br></br></br>  <br>Why did Kaminari get a fake tan?</br>  <br>my penis is too hard</br>  <br> ida knocked out <br> stain puts the balme on him somehow manipulating the scene. <br> ida is detained and blamed for stain's murderes, including his brother. <br> his familly despises him. <br> he is alone in the maximum security ward of the prision, nobody but deku and his bros believe him. <br> &gt;when they prove his innocence it's too late.<br> Ida has been already consumed by anger and desire of vengeande over the system. <br> he has turned into a villain. <br> he is released and supossedily goes back to the main group. <br> he has joined the vilain allianceand is acting as an insider for them. <br/></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So much for that helmet. I wonder if he'll get an edgy scar across his face out of this.</br>  <br>Walk it off man, walk it off</br>  <br>too  edgy <br><br> stain don't seem to be so cunning. </br></br></br>  <br>It's probably against Stain's creed to push the blame onto others. And how could anyone blame Iida for the murder of his bro when he was participating in a tournament miles away? <br><br>Your scenario is full of plotholes.</br></br></br>  <br>his quirk is being fast.<br><br> flash coudl do it appearing to be on both places </br></br></br>   ida can run as fast as flash <br> is a jobber </br>  <br>Yeah, I'm not under the impression Iida can move even remotely as fast as the Flash.</br>  <br>Way to make best girl look like a fucking lard.</br>  <br>but do the authorities know that?<br><br>they can accuse him of retrainign his power to not wake up suspicions.</br></br></br>  <br>He can run real fast for 2 seconds and then his engines overload. He's definitely not like the flash.<br><br><br>He's shown his potential in the tournament when he enabled Todoroki to nab Deku's headband. You're trying too hard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>yes I am.<br><br>I want an evil ida rather than a dead one.</br></br></br>  <br>But anon, he's already  quite evil <br><br>  I don't want him to die either, but try to create theories without holes in them.  </br></br></br>  <br>Holy fuck, where are you finding all these? <br>Is the new chapter out?</br></br>   ida's brother gets owned <br> brother not even dead <br> goes full edgelord <br><br>Ida is the Sasuke of this series.</br></br></br></br>  anime when?  <br>Did you read the manga ?</br>  <br>Toei will announce it within the next few months</br>    <br> Toei <br><br>HOLY FUCK NO</br></br></br>  <br>Momo's a chubby motherfucker.</br>  <br> TOEI </br>  <br> Iida hamming it up as a villain <br> he's making a big deal about cleaning the floors before Uraraka arrived <br>It's shit like this that made this my favorite manga.<br> Wonder how long before it goes off the deep end. </br></br></br></br>  <br>So this is the birth of Eyepatch-Scared-face Ida</br>  <br>Because he is best boy</br>  CHINESE SCANS ANY MINUTE NOW  <br> YOU LACK HATRED </br>  <br> not pierrot </br>  <br>If I recall correctly Stain didn't want to kill kids didn't he? This will probably end with Iida going full Punisher I hope.</br>  <br> Toei <br>That's more time for other  shitty  stuff I guess.</br></br>  <br>Don't play with my feelings</br>  Because of bullshit World Trigger being absent this week we can expect the scans earlier today, Ishuhui already did Toriko so only Haiykuu is left before HeroAca  <br>Nnnnnnnnnnnnooooooooooooooooo<br> <br>What to expect <br> flashback for days  <br> whole episode of flashbacks <br> recap episodes <br> 2-3 minutes of characters just staring in shock with suspense music in the background  <br> taking minute scenes and making them 10 minutes </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Holy shit, the Nomou army is coming to wreck shit up!</br>  <br>HOLY SHIT WHAT THE FUCK</br>  <br>holy fuck we are entering the creepy stages.</br>  <br>And i thought that Noumu was creepy, damn</br>  <br>That looks like it come right out of Berserk</br>  <br>Oh fuck, shit's about to get real.</br>  <br>Is the brain their weak spot? Did All Might ever hit the first Nomou on the head (brain)?</br>  <br>This, I like this.<br><br>I like BnHA to turn intoa darker manga than it initially seemed.<br><br>Man up Deku!<br><br>Now I want to see flashbacks from All Might or other heroes to see what horrors they have faced.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Will Ochako get Griffith'd in front of Deku?</br>  <br>Shigaraki's proportions are really weird in this pic.</br>  <br>Hhahhaha that shit would be funny</br>  <br>That would probably make them a vegetal, and we know how it worked with Superman.</br>  <br>I have a feeling that at some point one of Deku's classmates will get turned into one of these things.</br>  <br>That's amazing, but what does he say?</br>  <br>Sadrock or Octobro would make good Noumus</br>  <br>Awesome</br>  <br>YES, SHIT ABOUT TO GET REAL</br>  <br>We resident evil now.</br>  Summary from AS:<br><br>"Looks like Deku and Gran Torino decide to change locations for their training, taking a train to Shibuya. Meanwhile, it seems that the "normal" hero guiding Iida already guessed the boy's intentions. <br><br>Let's see, if I'm not mistaken, Shigaraki went to bust Noumu out of prison, while Stein continues his hero hunt. Speaking of Noumu, he looks different now, apparently having the appearance of 3 different people (really not sure on this part). After busting out, Noumu rushes into the train station where Deku and Gran Torino are at, and now a battle ensues, with the old man facing off against the monster.<br><br>Meanwhile, Iida finally encounters Stein who's in the middle of his hero hunt, and attacks him, calling himself Ingenium. Yet another clash between hero and villain takes place."</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This chapter is defnietly delivering.</br></br>  <br>If this shit is true then i expect some awesome fighting from the Deku and Gran Torino combo</br>  <br>hmmm those don't sound TOO fake.<br><br>But I don't think Ida mcan do much against Stain, also 5% deku will be pretty useless on normu, and gran torino has alrady shown his age.... how will they both handle these encounters?<br><br>it smells fishy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So, are these guys all brain dead too? Poor people</br>      <br><br>Holy fucking shit and thats why this is number fucking uno. God, that amount of hype.</br></br>  It's out.<br><br>http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/374<wbr>135</wbr></br></br>  <br> http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/37<wbr>4135</wbr> <br>nigga thats old.</br></br>  <br>You're a good man, anon.<br><br>Begin the summoning ritual.</br></br></br>  <br>He's lying</br>  <br> http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/37<wbr>4135</wbr> <br>I hope you get anal fisted by creepy hands guy!</br></br>  <br>Like Shigaraki would even wanna touch that anon.</br>  <br>Wait what, How<br><br>Someone said a few days ago that a few series coming back because they're montly<br><br>And Yet BNHA still get 1.</br></br></br></br></br>  P I N K Y<br>I<br>N<br>K<br>Y</br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah hah! really funny.<br><br>it's out now.<br>http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/454<wbr>135</wbr></br></br></br></br>    <br>stop sicking me</br>  <br><br>Stop.</br></br>  <br>She's not lard, she has a pleasing thickness, much better than shit-tier artists drawing their active girls with a literal pencil waist that should snap from the weight of their tits</br>  <br> fat <br>nigga do u even</br></br>  <br> CP: Black Clover, <br>Fuck you</br></br>  <br> ochako <br> not iida </br></br>  <br>It will probably be multiple of his classmates that will be turned into one big monster.</br>  t<br>theya are just veesels, we dont know wha happens to the real people.</br>  <br>I imagine that using invisigirl dna on pretty mmuch any monster would make it extremely OP<br><br>add fire power to burn potential ink/paint trick and you have a really solid enemy</br></br></br>  Can anybody please post that extra page from the tank of the fights that happen offscreen in the tournament leg in the original jump scans?<br><br>It was posted here before but I didn't save it. I re-reading it now but I can't seem to find what the new pages were.<br><br>Also back then it was mentioned that the mangaka fixed that plot hole about Hatsune(that support girl) escaping from Minetas balls. <br>Can post that the new page? Or atleast link that?<br>All im able to find was deku using his jetpack again and nothing about how they escape the ball.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Im the only one who thinks Hands guy will be turned into a Noumu monster after he fails several times?  Shigaraki is anti-deku, Stain killed Iida's brother. This makes me wonder if there will be more villains that have a connection to the main cast.  <br>No that will never happen. For one his goal is to kill all might which I do see happening, two even if he didn't manage it then you still can't really blame him, three why basically kill him off and make him a underling to a knew villain.</br>  Do you guys realize that barely one month passed in the manga since the beginning of deku's school life?  <br>Why would you think something stupid like that? He's clearly been chosen for a special role by the voice from the TV.</br>  <br> Why would you think something stupid like that?

So they're probably around April-June. FYI Japanese Schools start in April.</br>  <br>Ok, I didn't know that, thanks.</br>   raws wont be out until late this afternoon because nobody cares about this manga it's all about naruru, fairy tail and bleach <br><br>fuck</br></br>  <br>A Big clue can be seen in their outfits, it's not too hot because they're wearing long sleeves, but it's still warm enough that they'll take off their blazers, and their jackets for their gym uniforms. But then again it's not cold or getting their either because we see Deku wearing shorts inside.</br>  <br>those froppy feet</br>  <br>*there</br>  <br>Because she's so typical it's kinda boring.</br>    <br>Way to ruin the fun anon.</br>  <br>fuck yeah. Hopefully now there will be more frog fanart where her feet look normal since it's cannon. I don't know where they got that just because she has frog powers she needs to have frog legs.</br>  <br> I am Ingenium, the name of hero that will defeat you! <br> I see. Die. <br>Iida pls.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes please iida do as the man say and just die, so this way deku can get his class president spot back and make a move on the best girl in the class (hint:VP). (Plus for reason him, kacchan and grape all gets on my nerves and deserves to die)</br>  <br>Well, he is doomed</br>  <br> Implying Deku is somehow unique <br><br><br>It says something when Tumblr is so bored they have nothing better to do than troll on 4chan<br><br><br>Gonna ignore that file name</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>careful man i almost cut myself</br>  <br>The thing about it is that they're not posting with the intention of trolling, which makes it even worse.

If Iida were to die for any reason, I would certainly hope it wouldn't be for such a trivial matter as that. And Grapes isn't that bad. I like him, actually. Bakugou is, well, Bakugou, but I doubt Horikoshi would kill him off just because. I mean, it's pretty damn clear he'll have some pretty significant roles to play throughout the longevity of the series.</br>  <br>ill rekt u m8</br>  <br>whatever you say bruh</br>  watch this link, I'll upload it as soon as I get it from FA<br>http://www.readmanga.today/boku-no-<wbr>hero-academia/50</wbr></br>  <br>Just relized recently the translation group is vietnamese.</br>  <br> http://www.readmanga.today/boku-no<wbr>-hero-academia/50</wbr> <br> FA <br>No please.</br></br></br>  I think the Chinese scan was just released, but it requires an e-mail to acess it or something.  <br>No I'm not saying I want iida to die so deku can get his spot back! I just hate the things iida do, he has piss me off here and there since the beginning when he was acting like a righteous douche. Kacchan idk I don't really want him to die or turn evil but I still dislike him and his crybaby demeanor. And as for grape he really should die he is hands down the worst and most annoying character in this series, I hate every aspect about him and even if he doesn't die he should be demoted to support or general ed</br>  <br> Missing earplugs </br>  <br>that's just the schedule of what comes next, if the scans are done then they will announce it with this twitter like app on the left to it</br>  <br>Fuck off with your shit taste. You're disgusting. Stop posting.</br>  <br>No if you actually think that any of those three characters are good then you my friend have the worst taste of all.</br>  <br> BnHA is first <br> Straighten Up got CP <br>'tis a great day</br></br></br>  <br>LGTSS<br> Bleach </br></br>  <br>FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUU<wbr>UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<wbr>UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<wbr>UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<wbr>UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<wbr>UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>You're beyond saving.</br>  <br><br>So I take it the concept of subjectivity doesn't mean shit in these threads? I've never seen such congregation of self-righteous, narcissistic assholes before. Well, aside from tumblr.

Does it have a ceiling?</br>  <br>reverse ingenium confirmed</br>  <br> Toei </br>  <br>THIS FUCKING CHAPTER<br>IT'S NOT EVEN OUT AND I'M HYPED AS FUCK</br></br>  <br>Same to you sir</br>  <br>The first Noumu was the handsome one, heck</br>  <br>Why are they so fat?<br> Shouldn't they be rather fit?</br></br>  <br>citation needed</br>  <br>Check your eyes or something.</br>  Is BnHA the new Akame ga Kill on /a/? Not in term of quality but everybody is overreacting to new pages and is glorifying it like it was the best thing ever.  <br>No one (well not me at least) is self righteous! I just stated my own opinion and he decided I had shit taste so I commented the same thing back, now so do I honestly feel like you have shit taste for liking iida or kacchan no (grape yes ) they both are pretty are great fits in the role they were made for I just don't like .</br>  <br>Don't look fat to me...</br>  <br>They're realistic, Momo obviously works out. Kohei doesn't give them stupid proportions like oda</br>  <br>At least it's actually good</br>  <br><br> muscular women <br><br>that would scare away the shounen babbies</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Mantis Shrimp vision obviously.</br></br>  <br>Back when BnHA was new to /a/, it sure was hype.</br>  <br>To each their own. Honestly, there isn't a single character I hate in BnHA, aside from Endeavor, but he's pretty easy to dislike. My favorite characters are actually Tsuyu, Izuku, Tokoyami, and Mei.</br>  <br>Sure fat grills are realistic, it would have been fine by itself.<br>But they are supposed to be heros who train everyday.<br><br><br>You should, seriously look at them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For one it's the second greatest thing created by man, losing only to Jesus birth. Two nobody really overreacting, that imply that people are making it more of a big deal then it really is, when in reality it's just getting the right amount of prize.</br>  <br> For one it's the second greatest thing created by man, losing only to Jesus birth. <br>Please stop overreacting, you're making me feel ashamed</br></br>  <br>This isn't fat, stop watching animes about little girls or stop having fantaisies about skeletons.</br>  <br>They are not fat. Are you retarded? They are at a healthy weight you fuck. I guess you prefer females anorexic</br>  <br>They look fit though. Are you only looking at their core?</br>  <br>But they aren't fat at all? what are they supposed to be super skinny or extra toned? Yeah they are heros but that doesn't mean they spent their lives in a gym just look how slow ochako ran in the race. So yeah he drew realistic women.</br>  inb4 this happens  <br>He's gonna get Noumu'd.</br>  <br>I don't know, man. They pretty fit to me. Each and everyone of them could get the D.</br>  inb4 Iida goes mad as fuck mode going so fast he can't stop and the dies because his body can't handle the speed  <br><br>They are fat for wanna be heros, you don't look like this when you work the fuck out you fat fucks.<br>Go visit a gym.<br>Look at Deku and Bakugo and compare them.</br></br></br></br>  <br> and yeah I agree who someone choose to like or not is their own right. Like I lowkey like endeavor (well at least the role he plays) he's a better dad to me then gin and sasuke. But grape is the only one I can never seem to like and probably never will</br>  <br>Haha ok I was over the top with that one but no seriously I don't see it as being over hyped, it actually is the next biggest jump manga</br>  <br>Fuck you, don't say that.</br>  <br> Look at Deku and Bakugo and compare them. <br>Their quirks require them to workout you dumbass</br></br>  <br>this faggot doesn't even try it, bad bait is bad</br>  <br>So Deku is somehow great now? He's Luffy/Ichigo/Naruto tier</br>  <br>But deku was actually forced to work out! Ochako ability doesn't require it and size doesn't matter look at fucking no.13 yeah you can maybe say it's the suit but that nigga look far from skinny. So they're not fat just because they don't have rip six packs and don't fit a size two doesn't mean they can't be heros</br>  <br>that's this mask falling off</br>  <br>That's not fat. It's muscle.<br><br>It's still not super realisting because in order for them to have man waist like that they'd need to work out every day those muscles for years and I think none of them do it.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really, this is hardly "fat", they're just not starved skin over bones.<br>Even /fit/ bros know that the bodybuilder physique is far from what an actual peak condition build would look like.<br><br>Sharp muscle definition and such largely comes from ridiculously low amounts of body fat and is generally considered awfully unhealthy. If anything Horikoshi's women are more realistic than his men, which is refreshing compared to what is usually his main inspiration (Cape comics).</br></br></br></br>  <br>They actually have pretty realistic proportions, all things considered. Horikoshi has a good command of anatomy.</br>  <br><br>Its like I am arguing with a whale who claims to be healthy.<br>Big surprise, yes, even girls have muscles. But these are nothing but jelly.<br><br>I am not saying they have to be ripped or thin as fuck but come on, if they work out it gotta show.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now he's training to use his quirk uniformly around his body.</br>  Chink scan fucking when ?  <br>in 5 minutes</br>   People who can't differentiate fat from healthy thickness <br>They're even obviously toned, am I getting baited?</br>  <br>Rain in 5 Minutes</br>  I like how easy it is to spot the Deku x Momo fag.  <br><br>They would still have visible muscles though.</br></br>  <br>such bait</br>  Can we all agree that Dekus Hero outfit is shit?<br>I don't ever want to see him wear that stupid mask.</br>  <br>It's a hoodie now, we still haven't seen what it looks like.</br>  <br>Just admit you like chubbys.</br>  <br>No. You're gonna get shat on, son.</br>  <br>Unless they're on steroids and hitting the gym 24/7 they shouldn't have bodies like that.<br>And the reason is because ALL of them have the same body, it's not one exception. <br><br>Realistic fit girls would be Triage X ones(not anime and not counting big boobs). Their bodies are ripped as fuck but they don't have steroid-like muscles. <br>If you go to a gym you'll notice fit girls are ripped, not bodybuilders.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that bait tho</br>  <br>Not that anon, but they're right Deku and Kacchan's quirks do require them to be fit. We were shown as much from the first chapter.<br><br>Kacchan's quirk requires him to sweat a lot, so of course in order to learn how to control it he'd have to be fit as fuck.<br><br>If Deku isn't fit then he'll literally explode from the pressure of OFA.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hating Dekumom's hero costume <br>Eat shit.</br></br>  <br>Thank you! It has gotten a little better with the shorting of the ears but they should of scrap that shit along time ago.and i have yet to understand what the fuck it is and why he chose it? Like he could barely think up a hero name but could easily decided on that shit plus why does everyone get a utility belt when their power won't even need it</br>  <br>- realistic girls<br>- triage x<br>dude, just fuck off</br></br></br>  <br>No</br>  <br>I meant as in personality, he's not something great like anon was implying. <br><br>I was not talking about powerlevels, those 3 one-shot him with like a finger in powerlevel</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why did you lie to me ?</br></br>  <br>You've never been in the gym have you? <br><br>Dunno anon, just google search fit girls. They are exactly like that, arms legs and stuff. Like I said, leaving aside the tits.</br></br></br>  <br>No one expects them to be this ripped.<br>But they don't look trained at all.</br></br>  <br>we're talking about namek time over here</br>  <br> believing freeza <br><br><br>What the fuck is fit to you? It's just fit = healthy body. It's not they're bodybuilders.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Typical what, you shitface?</br>   If you go to the gym <br> implying anyone here goes to a gym <br>bait</br></br>  <br>Don't get mad someone insulted your waifu. <br><br>She's cliche</br></br></br>  <br><br> Maybe. </br></br>  <br>he's baiting, nobody truly believes best girl is worst girl. If they do we must execute them for the greater good</br>  <br>Isn't she weightlifter?</br>  <br> She's cliche <br><br>The whole manga is, that's why it's good.</br></br></br>  <br>You did when you used Deku and Kacchan as an example of what you think the girls should look like. You don't have to have a six pack to be fit, and girls who work out tend to be thicker on a whole. Have you ever seen volley ball players?</br>   /a/ - Boku no beito desu   <br>BnHA threads on a whole tend to be bait for /fit/.</br>  <br>Check her waist. Check the man-waist BnHA 15 y/o girls have. <br><br>I like them by the way, Momo is beautiful as fuck. Just saying that people saying their bodies are normal are joking.</br></br></br>  <br> Dark haired Mina <br>Disgusting. Mina is superior as delicious platinum blonde.</br></br>  <br>its exactly what it sounds like! she fits the bill of a jump herione whos destined to be with the MC. and im not saying its a bad thing shes still a great character who i love but if i had to rankt he females in the school it would be<br>-momo<br>-froppy<br>-gadget girl<br>-bitch from class B<br>-midnight(shes only this low because she isnt a student)<br>-invisible girl<br>-ochako<br>-ear plugs<br>-pinky</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  WHERE THE FUCK ARE SCANS GODDAMN IT  <br>hmm Fish</br>  <br>I certainly have.<br>Did you?<br>Competetive volley ball chicks don't look anywhere this unfit.</br></br></br>  Any minute now.  <br>I'm not the one acting like it's a masterpiece, tell that to the fags in this thread getting mad because people call out their waifus not being as great as they claim. <br>It's fun to read and I don't hate any of the characters but that's it. It's a fun read</br></br>    <br> fish <br>I HATE IT</br></br>  <br>Are you an idiot? <br>And I wasn't using the pic I posted as an example we're talking about the OP. <br><br>Jesus christ you people need to fuck off to wherever you came from it's like you're 15 y/o fuckers that can't have an actual discusion</br></br></br></br>  <br>Somehow I doubt it.<br>Both my mother and my aunt played it professionally. I'm not talking about beach volley ball players. But regular courtside, volleyball players tend to have very thick bottoms, they don't have six packs.<br><br>Not looking like a 10 year old boy isn't being unfit, not looking like you could bench press another person isn't unfit either.</br></br></br></br>  You guys are exaggerating.<br>They aren't fat, but they obviously don't look as fit as they should be.<br>Small failure on the artists part, he will surely improve.</br></br>  <br/>  <br> Dark hair <br>That's clearly pink, anon. Any dark is caused by the shading.</br></br>  <br>True, I think the reason is because the mangaka will make them more fit as the time passes, you know, to see how the characters have improved.<br>I mean, Uraraka looked more skinny at the beggining of the series.</br></br>  <br>Then how is she worst?</br>  <br>Right. She might end up like DekuMom if not for her change to be a more combatant hero.</br>  <br>In order to get that chubby she'd have to do a combination of overeating, stress, and not working out. Uraraka is too poor to overeat.</br>  <br> bitch from class B <br>The fuck did you say?</br></br>  <br> All those posts about thick hero girls <br>Most likely Kohei was just overambitious in his choice of pose. Compare Uhura in the bikini pic to any of the pictures of Urarara in her skintight costume. <br><br>She's not exactly Nami thin, but she's decently curvaceous.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He said "bitch from class B", anon.</br>  <br> Kacchan's quirk requires him to sweat a lot. <br><br>I can help with that</br></br></br>  <br> kacchan cant fap <br> if he does he risks blowing his dick up <br> this is why hes such an angsty asshole all the time </br></br></br>  <br><br>Compare and contrast further. Kohei probably just messes up.</br></br>      <br>Somebody needs a prostate massage.</br>      <br> implying he just doesn't have Deku do it. </br>  When will Dekus heroine appear?  <br>  I can't wait to see Kacchan all shirtless and sweaty  <br><br>  No homo  </br></br></br>  <br>Did Tsuyu not save his life?</br>    <br>Uraraka did it before her</br>  <br>HE HATES IT</br>  <br>I can't see it.</br>    <br>She's fine dammit.</br>  <br>Delicious.</br>  Can Bakugo make his semen explode?  <br><br>Or the author missed the proportions or maybe the shape of the bodies has something to do with the story of the special chapter.</br></br>  <br>Nothing gay about fitness.</br>  <br>I assume his ejaculations break through condoms at least.</br>  If Deku uses One for all while fucks, can it be considerd gang bang then?  Are these girls a little bit too fat, or is it just me?  <br>I'm just not seeing it.</br>  <br>That neck still bothers me.</br>  <br>They're not 15 yet. They're just 1 year old. This series is just from last year. So that guy is a toddlercon. Pervert!</br>  If someone cums inside Momo, can she store away the cum to make the use of condoms uneccessary?  Scans in 5 minutes  <br> too fat <br>The word is healthy, you're mom is too fat.</br></br>  <br>Can you please stop Frieza? I'm not falling for it this time.</br>  <br>I just realized Momo probably makes her own dildos....</br>  <br>It's only his sweat that has explosive abilities. No other fluids of his body as we know, but we might get surprised later on.<br><br><br>My nigga. I want to see how ripped all the boys are. We have only seen Deku and Todo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They are not fat!</br>  <br> yfw he become the DrDoom of the series, driven away and jealous of deku, not seeing how good he is himself. </br>  <br>He can only explode the sweat from his hands. It's pretty limited. He's not exactly Mr 5.</br>  <br>Evolutions, mang.</br>  <br> muh manly bodytype is beautiul too <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/<br>I'm sick of that shit, with vitiligo it's the worst memeporn subject since horse dickgirls</br></br></br>  <br>They're slightly off model, in a rather awkward pose.</br>  <br>Just what in the actual fuck are you talking about?You've been doing this since yesterday, stop it.</br>  <br>Underrated post.<br>And yes it will be a gang bang but only through one stick as weird as it sounds.</br></br>  <br>healthy, muscular, and fit</br>  <br>they look like real human beans, not 2D waifus</br>  <br>When will Deku's villainess appear?</br>  <br>The Catwoman to his Batman? The Aura to his Flash?</br>  <br>yeah way to FUCKEN FAT</br>  <br>Isn't sweat in the end just salty water?<br>Can he make an ocean explode?</br></br>  <br>Joker. Either comicbook joker or Heath Ledger Joker. Would be great too because Deku always seem to try and understand his opponents and it would be good to see how he handles someone batshit insane</br>  <br>I'm sure a blind person wouldn't have to worry about invisibility.</br>  <br>She's not chubby, that is a normal and healthy body.</br>  <br>I wouldn't mind their thickness if they weren't superheroes-in-training that should have slightly defined abs in the least. That swimsuit spread is dangerously close to "squishy" instead of "thick," as one implies a lack of muscle and the other implies healthy/toned.<br><br>Maybe I'm just paranoid after Mashima's shift into squishy over thick girls.</br></br></br>  The girls are built, not fat. Too much One Piece has rotted your brains on female builds.<br><br>Well okay yeah, Momo is totally like 1 pound away from a muffintop but the rest nah.</br></br>  <br>He doesn't sweat normal sweat he sweats nitroglycerin which he detonates</br>  <br>You were trolling after all.</br>  <br>Damn erza is so fucking hot. I didn't want to fap anon</br>  <br><br>Not fat, but I can't see how people think that they are even remotely fit or muscular.</br></br>  anyone got any spoilers?  <br>Read the thread.</br>  <br>See<br><br/></br></br>  <br>Omg, me too. He has a really nice back</br>  <br>Are you stupid?<br><br>Do you know how inconvenient it would be not having some sort of carrying space on your hero costume? If you can't have pockets then a utility belt is a good idea.</br></br></br>  <br>Utility belts are the ultimate tool for superheroes, look at fucking Batman.</br>  Still no chinkscans?  <br>It is a problem. All of the boys in class A (apart from Grapes) are ripped, but the girls aren't exactly /fit/.</br>  <br>Even Jammingway is /fit/.</br>  Which anime couples are examples of a healthy relationship?  Araragi and Senjougahara are hardly healthy.  <br>I think they wouldn't reach their current relationship in Tsuki's timeline if it wasnt healthy.</br>  None  <br>right in the feels.</br>  <br>it wasn't healthy anon bitch just got lucky RARARAGI is a lvl.99 white knight to leave her sorry ass</br>  Why so few couples seem to actually have fun being together?    <br>maybe in the beginning, but it became genuine.</br>  <br>can't have more fun together than these two</br>  <br>mostly because they become couples at the end of the story and they don't show their after stories.</br>  <br>thank god for the sequels.</br>  <br>Well they are immortal so yeah.</br>  This is probably the sole example in anime  <br>Araragi cheats on her both sexually and emotionally with just about every other female in the series.</br>  <br>He's too alpha to pass up.</br>  <br>The thing is most of the couples that do actually hook up are still awkward around each other in a way that might be cute, but doesn't at all suggest that they are comfortable with each other or have good chemistry.</br>  <br>Pic not related.</br>  <br>When your boyfriend is a serial child molester with an incest streak, furry obsession and has previously been raped by a BL loving lesbian then you are not in a healthy relationship.</br>  <br>They're both degenerate perverts and they deserve each other</br>  These two, they are supportive, kind, and share their feelings with each other.  <br>Molesting a loli ghost doesn't count.</br>  <br>He does struggle against monkey when she tries to sex him<br>I have no defense for the lolis or sisters</br></br>  <br>Your image is certainly not related.</br>  <br>Yamato is too idealized, even for anime standards. She seems pulled out of /a/'s collective thoughts</br>  <br>Koyokoyo says hi.</br>  <br>And what about a loli snake?</br>  <br>He never moved Nadeko, even when she was utterly presenting herself to him in Nise.</br>  After reading Kizu I'm pretty sure raragi and Shinobu are incredibly healthy together  <br>I'm starting to think we watched different shows.</br>  <br>Wait, is that even canon?</br>  <br><br>man couples are so gay, you just fuck bitches that's it<br><br>love is just so cheezy and lame</br></br></br></br>  <br>You must have a pretty happy life, then.</br>  <br><br>why wouldnt I? are you actually telling me you cant live without love?<br><br>fam that's lame</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon just said you have one, he/she didn't say anything like that. Hakuna your tatas</br>  <br>Because Japan can't into romance<br>It goes:<br><br> Be 12 <br> want to fuck tons of girls <br><br> Be 17 <br> Either NEET or well adjusted <br><br> Be 30 <br> Still NEET or working dead end job with boring wife and disappointing son <br><br>Being Japanese is suffering</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Conservative people, although it's ironic that they have a huge reputation for AV's</br>  <br><br>they should stop thinking about romance and start thinking more about sex</br></br>  kawaii as fuck   No Isaac and Miria <br> No Isaac <br> No Miria <br>This thread is shit</br></br></br>  <br><br> concensual cheating <br> acceptable <br>truly the beginning of humanity's decline.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it's been acceptable since the 70s or so they say</br>  <br><br>No, they aren't. That's what's so infuriating. They're both embarrassed children, too immature to make any progress in their relationship. They haven't grown closer or more intimate. The prerelease info for the sequel even confirms that.</br></br>    <br>Literally blind.</br>  <br>Get better eyes retard.</br>  <br>you just said it yourself<br> lolis and little sisters  <br>thats all the defense he needs</br></br></br>  <br>The show is already at this part? I guess I should pick it up then.</br>    <br>even the lesbians want him</br>  The healthier!<br>She healed his kokoro after all.</br>  <br>No, it isn't. There are actually some hints that Erika may have feelings for Kadota in the LN.</br>  I know it's NOT a healthy relationship, but she was a good influence to him. She was a healthy factor in his life. (Plus I'm watching Code Geass again and it is my Geass OTP)  <br>That's what I thought, there are even hints in the anime.</br>  <br> pic most definitely, undeniably, 110% not related </br>  <br>Eh. Isn't she the type of person that would let her boyfriend walk all over her? I also think Naruto is too dense to understand romance and how a relationship work, while she would be having trouble telling him what she want.</br>  <br>Don't post Shirley, I don't wanna cry.</br>    The healthiest  This  <br> couple <br>Never going to happen, m8.</br></br>  <br>Either way it's a very healthy relationship in which both parties are good for the other.</br>  <br>It's like you just killed the thread with that</br>  <br>Fucking narutards.</br>  <br>Despite how normalfag friendly this show/manga is, Winry is a great support character whose every appearance is done pretty well. They have their ups and downs and they support each other both phisically and mentally thoughout the whole story. Also, the scene where she realizes that she fell in love with Ed is fucking cute.</br>  normal healthy high school couple  <br>She's just a low maintenance girl. And Naruto is actually pretty suave around her.  He kissed her two times in the movie alone. </br>  <br>Agreed. There was also that scene were she couldn't shoot Scar and Ed told her her hands weren't meant for killing, but for giving life.</br>  <br>Yup, and that scene was done fucking well in the show.</br>  <br>One of those two times was at their wedding, though. But yeah, I never expected him to be so smooth.</br>  <br>The romance is sprinkled in every few episodes.</br>  The best.<br>Shame it will never happen</br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br> Naruto <br> Suave <br><br>"'He kissed her two times in the movie alone.'"<br><br> Thinking you have any concept of "suave" </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Shame it will never happen <br>Why does everyone keep saying that? It might happen, you never know for sure.</br></br>  There you go, a normal, healthy couple    The couple that make other couple inferior.  <br>Did they actually fug?<br>I dropped this after the NTR bit, not even because of that in particular but because the scans ended on it then</br></br>  Best couple  <br>No, he went back to that Madoka girl.</br>  <br>Fuck no, she's a slut<br> wanting to hold hands in the first date </br></br>  I'm far from being a Tomoyofag but still.  <br>Praise the anime gods for Tomoyo arc.</br>    <br> Stockholm syndrome and PTSD <br> Healthy </br></br>  <br>Orihime is basically Kubos ideal waifu so he'll pair her with Ichigo as some kind of personal wish fulfilment. How he managed to make ichiruki so vastly more popular than his own OTP is beyond comprehension. <br><br>You're writing this shit Kubo!</br></br></br>  <br>It's vastly more popular because Kubo made Ichigo and Rukia have really good chemistry.</br>  <br>It would be even more unhealthy for them if they were separated.</br>  <br>Only because she fucked his brain so badly by torturing the shit out of him.</br>    A healthy relationship.    <br>Greatest love story ever told.</br>  <br>I agree with you anon but that's what I don't get. Why did he make IchiRuki so much more appealing than IchiOri? Just so he could piss off everyone at the end when he pairs Ichigo and Orihime off?<br>I guess that would be a pretty Kubo thing to do.</br></br>  Not exactly healthy. But very fun.  <br>Their love is so beautiful</br>    <br>How can they be healthy if they're dead?</br>  <br>Good taste. And it's pretty healthy, they both save each other multiple times.</br>  Papa Bones welcomes you to his thread.<br><br>Momon and Narbel next episode.

I can already tell it's probably not going to be some SoL shit where they just chill in their dungeon, which is good, but what's the basic overarching idea of this story?    <br>How can there be end game when the LN and even WN have not ended yet?</br>  <br>Land Fall best girl then? Or maybe Certain Death?</br>  <br>No silly, it goes like this.<br> Skeletons are mobile and reclusive beings of extreme intellect. Unfortunately they must sleep or long periods of time. As such they end up staying still for an amazing amount of time. As they sit still a sort of fungus or moss can grow on them. This is known as flesh. If left untreated the sleeping skeleton will be more or less hijacked to be the backbone of another being in their sleep. Luckily, these odd beings die before the skeleton has time to wake up, making it harmless. </br></br>    So what happens to his real world body? Is he dead or did he just vanish?  <br> mfw this question again for the 834th time </br>  <br>Probably the former.</br>  <br>I would assume it's either just sitting there or it went fucking braindead.<br>Haven't read the LN so I dunno if they address it.</br></br>  <br>No end game known.<br>MC wants:<br> More information about the world and potential threats so he can keep the creations of his friends safe. <br>The Guardians want:<br> To take over the world and offer it up to Momonga as a jewel befitting their supreme master. <br><br>There's a lot of subtle movement towards both objectives. The season will probably end in...<br> One of the Guardians' loyalty being mind controlled out of them by a third party who uses a World Class item, leaving MC Spooky to duel with them. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A skeleton just wants to protect NPCs destined by his former guildmates since he sees them as their children. They think of him as this scary overlord and he does his best to keep up that persona. Misunderstandings and other shenanigans ensue and now the NPCs think he wants to take over the world. So he complies because he doesn't to ruin the image they have if him.</br>  Why doesn't he just marry Albedo the slut and live happily ever after?  I think it's interesting that the lich is the cutest of them all. NEET4LYFE  <br>Considering he can feel pain from a strong enough attack in this world, and by the assumption that any sane fucking DMMORPG won't carry over the sense of being stabbed in the stomach, EVERYTHING was brought into the new world, not just his dmmo "mind".</br>  <br>He's a skeleton anon, he doesn't have a boner that isn't made out of calcium.</br>  <br>Because it's all virtual and it probably freaks him out a bit.<br>Also he has a big ass staff of killing everything, might as well use it to do things.</br></br>  <br> NEET <br>But he isn't</br></br>  <br>see </br>  <br>His a spooky skeleton how does that even work?</br>  <br>Probably a mind split since the game tapped into his consciousness in the first place. Part of him got kicked off the server as normal and carried out his mundane life, none the wiser, and the part of him with the lingering attachment to the game stayed in the game world.</br>  <br>Not meet brah.

Pretty straightforward.<br><br>But what is the thought process for Stand users post-part 3 while naming their stands? And I don't mean obvious ones like "The Hand" or "Harvest", I mean shit like "Sticky Fingers", "Whitesnake", "Moody Blues", etc.<br><br>Do they just go "whatever" and pick shit that sounds cool?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Post best MADs. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YTo<wbr>74CA8yPo</wbr>  [ ]  <br>They're based on Bands, Artists or Songs.</br>  <br>They name themselves.</br>  <br>Songs</br>  <br>Yes, I get that, but I don't mean Araki's thought process, I mean the characters.<br><br>Like what,</br></br></br>  <br><br>Spice Girl did for sure, at least.</br></br>  <br>So one afternoon, Bruno was listening to the Rolling Stones and suddenly thought "shit, I'm naming my stand Sticky Fingers!"</br>  <br>The same reason characters like to shout the name of their stands when they activate them.

The wiki shows how many chapters are covered per episode.</br>  <br>But not the one from the "original" universe. So...</br>  So why can't they use names? Like, for most of them it's just fucking words like "Little Feet" how is that fucking trademarked? Like I understand unique names Like Metallica and shit but most of the names are just words they shouldn't have to change them to avoid copyright, it's bullshit imo.  <br>The name changes were retarded. The insertion of memes and Commie tier joke subs for everything else just made it one of the worst game localizations I'd see in years. I don't recall it selling much in the US so maybe I won't have to see that trash with EOH.</br>  <br>So you're saying it's not related at all that a DIO from a world where Jonathan Joestar never became his body still has The World, and not Hermit Purple.</br>  <br> I don't recall it selling much in the US so maybe I won't have to see that trash with EOH. <br>This isn't how copyrights work.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's saying hopefully it won't get localized.</br>  <br><br>Did anyone expect a series that JUST gained popularity in the west, not huge, but small to sell?</br></br>  <br>Bandai-Namco did apparently.</br>  <br>The said that?</br>  <br>Why else would they bother localizing it? For charity work?</br>  <br> Lets release a game in the west that's a celebration of all 8 parts while westerners have only seen the first 3 <br>Bamco never made intelligent localisation decisions.</br></br>  Is amazon the best place to buy Jojonium?  <br>So what? Doesn't change the fact that there is a Diego with The World.</br>  <br>So it has no bearing on the argument about DIO or Jonathan having the World. Diego is a separate character from DIO, AU Diego is even further separated.</br>  Doesn't TPP fuck over all band stands?  <br>The Phantom Pain?</br>  <br>He's an alternate version of Dio, and btw it is written in Jojo a gogo that the world is Dio's stand and hermit 2 is the stand of Jonathan, so stop with this bullshit please</br>  <br>The pirate party?<br>Trans Pacific Partnership?</br></br>  <br>Except for the fact that, every universe but the Prime one isn't canon.</br>  <br>No, he's not. He's an alternate version of Diego. Who is not Dio.</br>  <br> every universe but the Prime one isn't canon <br>Are you retarded?</br></br>  <br>Diego is an alternate version of Diego, and still, the World isn't Dio's stand, you ignored my second sentence to protect your silly headcanon</br>  <br>What does that have to do with The Pink Panther?</br>  <br>Are you even asking? He said that Diego isn't an alternate version of Dio. In fact Diego got a total different back story, attitude, stand and name.</br>  <br>Consistency</br>  <br>I felt like it wasn't even worth addressing. JoJo a GoGo is secondary material which has dubious usage since Araki changes his mind. Plus it still doesn't contradict the idea that The World is Jonathan's stand which might also have all the Joestar stand powers.</br>  After 100 years, there would have been two things in that coffin, the Joestar's greatest enemy, and the remains of their forefather. So, the question remains: What did Dio do with Jonathan's skull?  <br>Things that would make Pucci and Vanilla Ice jealous.</br>  <br> I didn't address it because it's secondary material <br>Nigga you're literally just making all this shit up without any proof at all and you dismiss secondary sources?</br></br>  <br> secondary material <br>What. He was written after part 5, why the fuck should he needed to change his mind 2 parts after sdc? Are you even trying or just shooting random bullshit?</br></br>  <br> The words from the creator himself don't count <br>You have to be baiting</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I haven't gone outside of the manga itself to find anything. Araki contradicts himself and changes his mind frequently, you should know that. How many dropped subplots do you need to get that? For that very reason anything outside of the manga itself doesn't have much use. He makes up whatever he feels like at the time.<br><br>Do you also want to say that Pucci never beat Jotaro, because Araki said in an interview that only Jotaro's kid with that idol would be able to beat him?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Muh headcanon counts more than an official book written by the mangaka </br>  <br>If Araki wishes for something to be true then it's fucking true you dumbass, he is the god of his fucking work he can do whatever he wants.<br><br>Also source on that idol thing because if it's before the end of Stone Ocean then your point is invalid there</br></br></br>  <br>OK, now show us the proof that Araki changes his mind 2 parts after sdc only because one morning he said "ehy, I now decided that the world is Jonathan's stand, I will never put this on the plot, I will even make another version of Dio Brando with the same stand so fans won't know that I made this new decision, I'm such a genius!"</br>  Is the Part 7 translation Vento Aureo-ish or am i just stupid? I just read the first few chapters of D4C (Right now i'm at the part where Gyro finds Johnny after being shot) and i really did not understand most of what was going on (With the multiple Diegos and Wekapipos, and the reason why the later died).<br><br>Does Valentine's ability get explained in better detail later or should i just re-read those chapters?</br></br>  <br>Stands protect their users, why the fuck should The World protect the one who killed his user?</br>  This is a really unimportant question that no-one should give a shit about, but what color should Gyro's teeth be in the possible Part 7 anime adaptation?<br><br>http://strawpoll.me/4871484</br></br>  <br>There can't be two same people in the same universe, so they just fuse and die</br>  <br>I don't like the goldish color, I would rather prefer silver</br>  <br>Nah, it's just bizarre</br>  <br>Imagine that it's like matter and anti-matter, but exclusive to people. When a person goes to an alternate world and comes into contact with his alternate self, they both fuse and die. It's exclusive only to each specific person, contact with anything else when visiting an alternate world has no repercussions, only contact with your alternate self. You could potentially live your own life normally in this alternate world, so long as your alternate self is avoided, whether he is dead or alive does not matter.</br>  <br>So Basically. "I'm going to keep adding bait to this meme so I can bust a nut off of all the spergs getting upset by it."<br> I like you.</br></br>  <br>Not him, but I remember in the same interview they showed Wekapipo. It's on youtube somewhere.</br>  <br>That depends what you're talking about. Actual Jojoniums or the Viz English release is isn't called Jojonium but uses the assets? For the viz release you'd be better off buying from Book Depository, cheaper and free shipping. As for the actual Jojoniums, Amazon.jp or CDJapan.</br>  <br>Wait, is he seriously talking about the Shoko interview? Now I know he is fucking baiting, Araki was obviously fucking joking when he said that to her. Araki isn't joking in his artbooks.</br>  I can kind of understand how King Crimson works but how does Gold Experience work? It brings things to life so how does it turn a broach into a ladybug which is actually a tracking device which is actually the stand using turtle?  <br>Gold Experience works in any way Araki wants it to work. It's the asspull stand to end all asspull stands.<br>And you just wait till you get to the end...</br></br>  <br>is there something wrong with the way he's loading the gun? because I just took it at Sex Pistols rerouting all the bullets so they don't hit him.</br>  Why has nobody who had possession of the Stand arrows tried stabbing themselves with it multiple times? DIO could have had The World Requiem x 100000.  <br>The bullet is the dark grey part at the front the rest is the casing when you fire a bullet the hammer hits the casing which ignites the propellenet within pushing the bullet forwards. The fired bullets Mista is picking up still have their casings attached. You could pretend it was sex pistols kicking the bullets out of the gun but the casings still shouldn't be there.</br>  <br>Meant for<br/></br>  Your reply to this is going to be "Why does this exist Anon!"<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=aD-<wbr>ZWzssjBQ</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> Pronouncing Kakyoin as Kyokin <br>What the fuck</br></br>  When the fuck did dio use hermit purple?im only on part 2 in the manage but I watched the anime to the end and didn't see it used once.  <br>The guy isn't a Jojofag, plus the Story was prolly written horribly (It's about Jotaro sensually making Ravioli for his boyfriend, go figure.)

Please tell me you're not getting this from Jorge Joestar, it's not canon.<br><br><br>I know who the Spice Girls are, I'm saying that specific joke, just terrible then.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>dude, anyone who didn't get killed in the previous universe by pucci gets transfered to the next one. And pucci can't possibly kill Notorious BIG because its a stand so you can't turn it back into a disc via whitesnake, Gravity don't mean shit to it no inverting is, and touching it with Made in heaven even with super speed is just gonna get Pucci infected and die. Or worse Pucci becomes possessed by it and it uses HEAVEN itself.</br>  <br>you said anyone, stands aren't people, since the user for notorious big gets irenized, the stand ceases to exist</br>  what if Ungalo vs Rohan?  Could D4C walk into Cream's dimension or would he be atomised?  <br>Well seeing how Vanillia seems fine in his dimension, its safe to assume anyone who can cross dimensions wouldn't be vaporized in the transition. Remember, the president was perfectly find from having pieces of him pushes to another dimension from water falling on his face. <br><br>Also I now want a drawfag to draw Valentine and Vanilla ice laughing at people from inside of cream.</br></br></br>  <br>filename time?</br>  <br> weather report in the same tier as yellow temperance and echoes </br>  <br> capable of writing any possible effect on anything <br> capable of massive gravity and Stand Rush punch strength. <br><br>Like I'll agree that Echo would be on the lower end of that tier and weather higher, but by both are very capable stands. Echos is massively versatile, while Weather is versatile and powerful.<br><br>But neither of them would be in the same tier as the stands in the tier above, and they can handle a lot more shit than the one in the tier below.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Elder god tier - No chance to defeat it <br> Notorious BIG <br> Mid Tier <br> the hand <br>You realise the hand can erase BIG very easily right?</br></br></br></br></br>  Why is Catch the Rainbow so cute?  <br>Who won the race?

Why did Diavolo tell Passione to bring his daughter to him instead of telling them to kill her? Isn't their job assassination you'd think they'd be pretty good at it.<br>When Bruno took her to the tower why did Diavolo abduct her why didn't he just leave a wad of cash and a note telling him to leave her there for the next group of agents to pick her up.<br>Why was he so worried about being seen when he could just assume the Doppio persona in case Bruno caught any quick glances and if Bruno took a deliberate look just king crimson that away.<br>If he absolutely had to attack her then and there why didn't he just slam his hand through her skull instead of cutting her hand off and running off with her.<br>Where was he planning to go with her that would make any difference? Surely king crimson could deal with any onlookers if she died in the tower instead of the secret morgue.<br>I don't understand.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what happened?</br>  <br>Domain seems to elapsed.<br>Hopefully it's not the end of the BD subs, but they've never had much means of communication available.</br></br>  <br>The true, real, 100% cannon answer is that Araki makes shit up as he goes and it causes plot holes.<br><br>But you can explain some of it away as Diavolo being clinically paranoid. He really had no reason to have Trish put down because she barely had any idea who her dad was and people were gonna get no clues out her. But Diavolo is clinically paranoid and acts irrationally like 90% of the time. "OH NO my daughter that's never met me is gonna reveal my identity!" And then he retrieves her in a jazzed up and crazy way.</br></br></br>  <br>The real answer is: Araki doesn't give a fuck and does whatever is cool.</br>  <br>Yellow Temperance  HAS NO WEAKNESS </br>  <br>Isn't a Stand an extension of the soul, though? Jonathan's soul isn't in his body, Dio's is. Thinking The World is Jonathan's Stand is cool, but probably incorrect.</br>  <br> Love Train above CHUMIIIIIIN </br>  So I began watching the 2012 anime. Is that true that the first 9 episodes are like the prequel to the Jojo that appeared in the manga/games? I'm a little confused. Great series by the way.  <br>Where did you hear that false information?</br>  <br>Except for being incredibly slow and close range only and Rubber Soul can only control what's touching him the goo that gets attached to Jotaro can only mindlessly chew his hand.<br>Also it can be easily pinned down by a stand like Echoes act 3 and Rubber Soul isn't protected against any non-physical or internal stand attack like grateful dead or Lovers. Crazy Diamond could probably revert Yellow Temperence back into all the random creatures and objects it assimilated.<br>Yellow Temperence is fucking trash.</br></br></br>  <br>100<br>Implying Star Platinum isn't at least high teir.</br></br>  <br>Dude from work who recommended me the anime.</br>  <br><br>Why is she sitting like that?</br></br>  How did Cairne get anywhere in the gang when Notorious Big only activates when he's dead? Did he just tell them his stand was really really amazing and Diavolo said welcome to the inner circle?  <br>People that stupid can get jobs? All of the parts are their own thing. There isn't a main JoJo. The first 9 episodes are Part 1 and the rest are Part 2. Part 3 is in anime form too. The manga is better at showing the parts as seperate. All of the parts have something to do with each other plot wise, though.</br>    <br>He was kept as the gang clown.</br>  <br>she probably thinks my face is there</br>  <br>I see.

You write on a person and they follow that rule you can't just write on yourself and expect everyone ever to follow that rule since Heaven's Door needs a target and doesn't have infinite range.</br>    <br>stop</br>  <br><br>He can't read his own history using Heaven's Door, and I don't think he can write on himself either. Only a copycat stand like Boy II Man could affect Rohan using Heaven's Door.</br></br>  <br> Tusk <br> only HIGH </br></br>  <br>Then he could just write on someone else that they had the ability to read and write on Rohan's pages.</br>  <br><br>No idea if Rohan at the Louvre is canon but he could write on himself there. He never did it in Part 4.<br><br>So even if he were to write "I am invincible" on himself, he would follow the rule, but nobody else would unless he wrote on them too, which means that he wouldn't actually be invincible?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Correct.

It might not be a bad idea to come up with a tier list as a thread, there's nothing else to talk about.</br>  <br>Every time Johnny ever used act 4 or anyone using the infinite spin, it requires a horse.<br><br>No horse, no infinite spin. Just because a stand appeared doesn't mean anything.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you fucking retarded? D4C Love Train defies logic, even oceans move closer to him. Gay priest cannot outrun him. Heck it could even change the gravitational forces direction and cancel MiH all together.</br>  <br> 10 meter range </br>  <br>The list is shit but that part makes sense. Love Train creates a dimensional wall. Very few stands could pierce this dimensional wall, and I doubt that speeding up time will let Pucci go through it.</br>  New speculah <br>http://araki100p.web.fc2.com/jojoli<wbr>on_nazo_yosou036.html</wbr></br>  <br>Araki realized that the World having every stand's ability is too OP and changed his mind</br>   He can, however, shortcut the process as a last ditch effort, using a Steel Ball to temporarily galvanize his horse's movement. <br>Has Johnny ever done that?</br>  <br>I just realized, is that his future wife Rina standing there?</br>  <br> nyohoho </br>  <br>Wait a second.

I mean with Kraftwerk and Aerosmith it's easier because they're band names and nothing else, but Gold Experience and Oasis are all technically just regular words.</br></br>  <br>filename time.</br>  <br>I wish Araki did more interviews so we could find out what the fuck he was thinking with certain things</br>  <br>And all that bullshit is ignoring it's most powerful ability, that harming the life Gold Experience creates reflects the damage back to the attacker.<br><br>Giorno only used that shit twice, both to kill Luka and to make Koichi hit himself in the face.</br></br></br>    <br>I want to know what he was thinking while doing Part 6, especially Heavy Weather and Sky High.</br>  <br> Johnny appears with SP <br> He and Diego start flying like Jotaro and DIO <br> Johnny's legs keep flapping around because he has no control over them </br></br></br>  <br>Someone mentioned this last time this was brought up, but it's worth noting that to people that have been following the manga as it releases, it had been like 20 years since we last saw the World. So it was fanservice yes, but not really a bad kind.</br>  I'm halfway through part 3 and can someone tell me why polnareff is more of a protag than Jotaro ?    <br> &gt; flying like Jotaro and DIO <br>yeah was that ever explained?</br></br>  <br>That filename really has no relevancy to the actual pic, you dolt. "Filename time" means post normal pictures/gifs/webms that relate to jojo once you read the filename.</br>  <br>I always thought it was something like DIO just being able to jump really, really high and far because vampire and Jotaro doing the same using Star Platinum.<br><br>The anime kinda destroyed that idea though.</br></br></br>    <br><br> From what I've seen, the game itself is too meme-y and shit </br></br>  <br> I've heard it's actually the best telltale game they've done compared to Walking Dead and Wolf Among us. I don't know though since I think those games are boring as fuck to play </br>  How did you guys get into JoJo? I want to start but there's so much stuff.<br>Just begin at the manga and go through everything in release order?</br>  <br>Here's another one.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br> I've heard a few things about the manga and watched the first 7 episodes of stardust when it came out on crunchyroll  then I read the manga from the beginning then watched part 1&amp;2 then the rest of SDC until I caught up</br>  <br><br>I thought the point of Hey Ya was that everything went in Pocoloco's favour, but that doesn't mean it has to go perfectly for him.<br><br>Like if he sets out to win the lottery, he might lose, but he'll find like a gold watch on the floor while he's leaving.</br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?t=124<wbr>&amp;v=tK77U7ACc8I</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Dio's timestop can look pretty confusing to outside viewer.</br></br>  <br>It gives him extremely good luck but doesn't make him invincible. I.E. There might be an instance where someone shoots him, without Hey Ya! he would die but with Hey Ya! the guy would miss the kill shot but still severely wound him.</br>  <br>I just watched Bloody Stream OP and it convinced me it was worth watching/reading</br>  <br>I think the Telltale game has better humour than the ACTUAL Borderlands games. Those, well at least 2 and the pre-sequel, are full blown "meme-y" and really unfunny most of the time, though they do have their moments</br>  <br>Heard the name, thought that it sounded fun.<br>And it was.</br></br>  <br>Didn't Kira say he named his Stand Killer Queen? I think they choose the names themselves.<br><br>I mean, be honest. If you had a Stand, would you come up woth an original name, or nickname it a reference to something?</br></br></br>  <br>first two parts are short enough, read them, SC anime is a faithful adaptation so you can watch it instead, Kakyoin dies</br>  <br>Every main villain stand is terrifying either in appearance, in ability or both, even to a stand user.</br>  Can one actually attack Gionro/GER if there is something that doesn't target Giorno specifically? Like The Sun or something. Giorno would be affected, but it's not a specific, targetted attack. Or could GER negate that too?  <br>I'm guessing that you can negate GER if you don't try to attack it but do it accidentally.</br>  <br>Weather Report might be able to to with oxygen but that would really only work in an inclosed area.</br>  Not 100% Jojo related, but...<br><br> Standing in line  <br> People behind me talking about there could be a head transplant by 2017 <br> I look it up <br> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/He<wbr>ad_transplant</wbr> <br> We can have DIO in 2017 </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>anything that is suppose to harm giorno is set to 0</br>  <br><br>It is.

It has infinite range and the fictional characters have all their abilities from their stories and even when something impedes them, they use cartoon logic to circumvent it. There is no way to overcome this stand without the prior two above<br><br>- Notorious BIG is completely indestructible and immortal. No action except for Zeroing it, D4C clone cancelation, or Killer Queen Bomb 1 can possibly defeat the stand once and for all. <br><br>- D4C Love Train is here because outside of Tusk, ball breaker, and potentially Cream, nothing can possibly do any harm to Valentine. All actions will be redirected.<br><br> God tier <br>Made in heaven is here because all stand below it on the list can just be overpowered by its super speed, time manipulation, and the affects of time speed up on the user. Universe ending is something that can overcome just about anything<br><br>- Cream is capable of dispatching anything into its dark dimension to erase them. The user technically never has to leave the dark dimension to see or could just fly upwards out of any possible enemy range before reassessing the next trajectory of the dark dimension. <br><br> High Tier <br>- Bite the dust is an instawin on anyone who learns about kiras boner, sheer heart attack is almost unstoppable, and bomb 1 dispatches and implodes anything that touches it. <br><br>- King Crimson can see 10 seconds into the future, skip 5, letting it always know whats coming and able to skip anything it doesn't want. Only against forces of nature beyond it like the higher tiers can possible stand against this.<br><br>(will continue)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To reverse the infinite rotation that Diego gave him.</br>  <br>Could be worse. The only person I know who reads Jojo didn't get what Killer Queen referenced. I mentioned the band Queen and he just thought Killer was slapped on to the front of the stand's name.<br><br> captcha wants me to select clam chowder and ramen as "soup" </br></br></br>  <br>To me the idea never held water in the manga since Jotaro and Dio were just levitating without even moving their legs during their Stand rush.</br>  Why does nobody bring up how fucking out of character it was for araki to go full smut with the Scarlet/Lucy facesitting, like hot dang.  <br>Fanservice and to have Scarlet fall asleep without falling over all of a sudden or saying that she needs to sleep.</br>  I'm on the bait fight in Part 7 and everything just seems to be getting gayer and gayer as time goes on.  I don't mind, it's hilarious. <br><br> Johnny screaming Gyro's name constantly <br> "I can't trust anyone but Gyro!" <br> All the penetration and ball-touching <br> Johnny starts to enter Gyro's body forcibly </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Keep reading. There's lesbian gay.</br>  Why do animefags get mad when you spoil shit in the manga?  <br> High Tier continued <br><br>- Chariot requiem can turn stands against their users, put people to sleep, swap their souls, regenerate, and can only be defeated if the user attacks their own shadow. If this was used offensively by polneraff and not be a rouge stand, it would be nearly impossible to counter without being in the higher tiers.<br><br>- Tusk is only in the high tier because its Elder God ability, Act 4, can only be used when on a horse and the range of the infinite speed bullets and the stand is only 10 meters. So while it is capable of going toe to toe with things on the higher tiers, it has too many requirements that could easily be dispatched and force johnny back to act 3. <br><br>- World / SP's time stop ability makes their offense undefendable against. Without being one of the higher tier stands, Timestop can't be countered. <br><br>- Heavens door has amazing potential, but very limited range. Either by looking at it or being touched can it activate, and even with its near infinite capabilities, that range keeps it from being any higher. <br><br> OTHER SHIT PEOPLE KEEP ASKING ABOUT <br><br>- Hand is only mid tier because while it does have the same capabilities as cream, its very limited. Only 2 meter range, and its surface area for erasing is much smaller being only its hand. Also unlike cream it can not fly or protect its user completely with its deleting. <br><br>- I agree, Weather Report should have been put in High Tier, because Heavy Weather alone is a broken power that trumps all other stands. And then after that there is its massive pool of "weather" related abilities. my bad. Weather Report is High Tier.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Stop making tier lists when you don't even know powers of stands. KC can skip 10 seconds.<br>You are fucking stupid.</br></br>    are there jonathan and gappy versions of this?  <br>Lucy's husband came to help him with a horse. That didn't happen. He used that on the gyro's corpse's crate though.</br>      <br>Hmm, I can't really remember but I do remember that the spin was affecting him to the point where he couldn't ride a horse properly.</br>  <br>I don't know, but if you give me the original I could make a version for every JoJo</br>  <br>I never saved the original, sorry<br><br>there are versions of each except for jonathan and gappy.</br></br></br>  It is Joestar or Joester?  <br>The moments where DIO stops time only to get BTFO are hilarious. There should definitely be a version of this in the BD's though.</br>  <br>Toaster</br>  <br><br>Holy fucking shit your tier list is fucking retarded. Green Baby is not even broken. Anything with hax can kill it. Bohemian Rhapsody is a shit stand and cannot 1v1 any stand that has a gimmick.<br>Cream and The Hand can erase B.I.G.<br>Cream CANNOT eat Love Train. The Hand can.<br>Made in Heaven shits on Bohemian Rhapsody. But it is not even that good compared to others in "high" tier.<br>Cream is a shit stand. I don't know why you even put him in "God" tier. <br>BtD should be higher.<br>KC is superior to Bohemian Rhapsody, D4C Love Train, MiH, Cream, BtD and Green Baby. It's the second most broken stand after GER.<br>Tusk Act 4 is used with a steel ball here<br>ZW/SP is also superior to any stand in the upper tiers. I don't know why would you even consider MiH is better than ZW/SP<br>Heaven's Door also shits on upper tiers.<br>The Hand can teleport itself by erasing the space between. Cream sends something to a different dimension. The Hand erases it completly. Which means Tusk Act 4 or D4C Love Train would get erased.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   another shit tier general filled with anime babies <br><br>Please cucking die</br></br>   Dio moves to a setting as unlike the ocean as possible after spending a hundred years trapped there (the desert is hot, dry and bright) <br> Jotaro becomes a marine biologist and spends a lot of his time (presumably) in places like seaside Japanese towns and Florida, near the ocean, after defeating Dio <br><br>discuss</br></br></br>  <br>What's there to discuss?</br>  <br>So Dio don't like to get wet?<br><br>Like a cat?

It can make superman real and is devoid of logic. its fucking way more potential than any other stand.<br>- Outside of them, D4C, and Bust the dust nothing can really kill BIG. Thats why its so high<br>- Why would the hand be able to and cream not? Same stand same ability. Both cross dimensions and remove space.<br>- Made in heaven does, but the sheer potential of Rhapsody makes it higher. being able to summon Superman and other cartoon illogical bullshit can circumvent Heaven.<br>- Cream literally never has to live his dark dimension. Only reason he did against Pol is because he didn't want to destroy the whole mansion so he had to efficiently eliminate him. Without that limitation, he could just erase all other the place for a while, then fly up high out of any stands range and then survey the area to see if he got his target, rinse repeat. <br>- BTD has to be activated via boner telling. higher tiers can circumvent this and long range stands can shit on it. <br>- Please tell me with reason how it could circumvent those without just "it works"<br>- wasn't infinite spin. His stand was just there. Gyro literally says you require a horse to super spin. And in every fight and even when saving his son from face cancer johnny has to get a horse and a running start. No horse, no super spin. <br>- Made in heaven can speed up even the time lapse of Time stop to a degree and move faster than either of them. Also its universal effects up it higher. <br>- Heavens door shit range can't do anything any of those higher tier ones. <br>- People keep acting like Hand can move around like Cream, but not, its got a 2 meter range and is limited in its deleting surface area. And even Okuyasu says "i don't know where the hand sends things it erases." same shit as Cream.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Other than fucking a twink.

I bet you like traps.</br>  So what's the deal with this series? I was seriously disheartened by the first episode, I was pretty much on the verge or dropping this, but Anons kept praising it and saying it's the definite AOTS, so I decided to give the second episode a chance. What a mistake. I thought the fujobait would lessen after the initial exposition in episode 1, but it actually only got worse. Fucking hell, the very first scene is the absolute definition of female powerful bara wet dream.<br> Some bald buff ugly nigger is being a complete jerk and objectifying a woman that's passing by. Fortunately, he bumps into the uber strong white beautiful short bara who is about to fucking destroy the nigger but he doesn't because he is gracious and merciful, and frankly too strong to deal with suck small fries. <br>So pretty much 15 seconds into the episode and I want to barf. Some of the other obvious issues with this piece of shit series:<br> Glorification of prostitution. <br>The author just loves putting prostitutes on a pedestal, which is frankly disgusting. This is not something you can make light of, especially since women all around the world are suffering because of it. It's basically enabling women's suffering and sexual exploitation.<br> The main baddie is a PoC <br>Seriously? This bitch of an author should seriously check her goddamn privilege. Why are all the good guys pretty and white? Hell, one of the MCs is even blonde with blue eyes. Talk about racial stereotypes, golly...<br><br>Add to all that the excessive violence, the objectification of the males characters (all of them are pretty much female power fantasy), the blatant portrayal of women as powerless creatures in a patriarchal society, the constant sexual innuendos, as well as the all other typical fujobait tropes. Really, this must be one of the worst animes made as of recently.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's unpleasant to look at. Deal with it.</br></br>  <br>im too lazy to post a bait pic so just imagine i did</br>  <br> marathoning <br> first episode <br>How do you guys even manage to do this without passing out?</br></br></br>  <br>You have issues, if the dude has only a bit, it's kind of sexy. It shows off his virility.</br>  <br> You have issues <br>Being heterosexual?</br></br>  <br>But Nicolas is Asian.</br>  Is there anyone in the credits credited with the sign language research? I'm wondering how accurate this all is.  <br>It's a manga adaptation, idiot.</br>  <br>The faggot doth protest too much. Get out of that closet.</br>  <br>Heterosexual people aren't afraid of men.</br>  <br>how the fuck are these pubic hair? seems more like belly hair. I got them.</br>  <br> "nigger" and "PoC" in the same post <br> misogynist attack on women and SJW-esque defense of women in the same post <br>I don't even</br></br></br>  <br><br>Finding male pubic hair to be aesthetically unappealing = being gay and afraid of men<br>OK.<br>I just don't like looking at aesthetically unappealing things. I figure if I'm going to waste my life away watching anime I might as well at least make it anime that's nice to look at. That's why I always watch any anime by Kyoto Animation, except Free!, because half naked men are aesthetically unappealing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But the Free! guys don't have pubic hair, or pubic anything. They are ken dolls.</br>  <br>Your aesthetic sense is so shitty, you are a failure of a human being if the male form cannot be beautiful in some minor way to your eyes. Let me guess, you think other guys' dicks look nasty?</br>  <br> you think other guys' dicks look nasty? <br>Absolutely disgusting.</br></br>  <br>You are gay if you aren't attracted to anime men</br>  <br>Sorry to burst your bubble, but the sexuality between women can be just as depraved as the sexuality between men.</br>  Was the thread last week as bad as this one?  Bleach chapter 634 thoughts?theories?  That flashback kinda bored me, wish it was only like 2 chapters instead if Bazz was just going to job that hard. Glad it's over because basically everything else going on is exciting.  Asspulling backstories to drag things out for a bunch of more chapters, I expected nothing less from the master.  <br>Asspulling is definitely not the right term to use, thats basically just how back stories work.</br>  <br><br>Well, ultimately, only future will tell whether it was a flashback for the sake of having a flashback, or something actually relevant to the main story.</br></br>  <br>True, but either way it wouldn't be an asspull.</br>  <br><br>But does anyone really care for more backstory?<br>More flashbacks for some random baddie that's gonna get BTFO in a few episodes?<br><br>I'm might be getting too old for this shit, but I read each chapter in less than a minute hoping for something to happen. At least Naruto had the worst girl and her fanbase getting cucked.<br><br>I just want it to end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In the first place, I'd have cared for backstory on basically anyone but Bazz-B and Jugram.</br>  <br>strange how it mirrors the byakuya / renji relationship...</br>  kubo's habit of "their abilities are so powerful i don't have to draw them, only their aftereffects" got old literally a decade ago  <br>Nothing strange about it, Kubo knows what sells and the stoic cold guy/snarling wild boy pair has been a staple of his fan polls. He pulled this same shit with Ulquiorra and Grimmjow two arcs ago(arc and a half? do we count fullbring as a full arc?) albeit a little less blatantly.</br>  <br>I still think hes sojun. notice the strike he used to finish bazz. that 'im so fast i go through you lol'. and then how the next moment he was holding bazz. hes fast. byakuya like.</br>  <br>i can never tell when you post your sojun theory nonsense if you're being sarcastic and trying to be funny about it or if you're being totally serious and you're just stupid</br>  At what point was I supposed to care about this fucking characters<br><br>Fuck you Kubo<br>Am I supposed to feel sad that Bazz-B is dead? After he killed Hitsugaya and countless shinigami? Is that seriously what youre trying to do Kubo with these inane flashbacks? Fuck off</br></br></br>      <br>This brings back some fond memories.</br>  its comming soon  <br>note the similarities.</br>  <br> character moves really fast and attacks before they even notice. <br>Holy shit. Thanks for pointing out the only 2 instances in bleach where this has happened.</br></br>  Chapter seems familiar<br> https://<span>youtu.be/9JXKWPkJOgw  [ ] </br>  <br>Rukia did it to as nodt. its a kuchiki technique knobhead</br>  <br>I know what you meant by it, but I don't think the intention was to have similiarities.<br>The moment Ichigo got rekt by Byakuya was somewhat unexpected and was to demonstrate a huge power gap while the outcome of this fight was more than obvious as Bazz-B is a terciary character and will likely not get a training arc to come back and fight Haschwalt again.</br></br>  Holy shit Bazz-B got fucked wrecked. That was just brutal. I didn't expect it to be so one-sided. Was Jugo even using his ability or was that just sword skills?  <br>I think he just rekt him without any power release.</br>  <br><br>Agreed. I expected Bazz to force Jugo to show off something, but no, Jugo was just doing a lot of holding back, dancing around gently, before deciding to win. It was like a OPM fight.....to put it positively.<br><br><br>However, our appetites sure are whetted for a decent opponent for Haschwalth. Perhaps Shunsui? Ichigo? Aizen? Ginjo? Kenpachi?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  the difference was class </br>  <br><br>"Shall I tell you the difference between you and I? It's level. It's like the story of the monkey trying to capture the moon. No matter how he struggles, it's just the moon's reflection on the water he sees. So he only sinks into the water. Time after time, he sinks."</br></br>  <br>Well, at least this adds up more to the Quincies backstory, the last filler was about characters running around and grouping, then doing it again but this time with some third rate characters to make it more interesting,</br>  <br> tertiary <br>he took out kira, hitsugay. gave shinji trouble. survived against powerbuffed renji longer than mask did.</br></br>  Anyone remember a lot of little insects talking about how the presence of someone gave them power and life?  <br><br><br>you honestly think kubo made bazz bond with renji for no reason? it was to emphasize their similarities. <br><br> strange sense of style <br> always in the shadow of another <br> wild guy a rival of a classy better <br> renji even foreshadowed bazz's real name by calling him a bird (chicken). </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  bump with Momo   Bazz will never become BFFs with Renji   RIP majestic mohawk  <br> its a kuchiki technique <br><br>no you moron, its an anime cliche</br></br></br>  <br> Was Jugo even using his ability <br><br>Did you not pay attention?<br>He has no abilities other than making others stronger. That's why he became captain, to give the Sternritters more power</br></br></br></br>  <br>and its only been used by kuchikis in bleach you faget.</br>  <br>You're forgetting shunsui, ichigo and yoruichi whose ability is literally "im so fast you cant see me kill you"</br>  <br> shunsui <br>oops I meant suifong</br></br>  <br>byakuya, not his dad, not his grandad, not rukia, yoruichi, soifon, ichigo, grimmjow, zomarri, starrk, tsukishima, aizen etc... etc... And even if we pretend it's not just Kubo's lazy repetative panel composition, even in-world it was never a kuchiki thing anyway, it was a shihouin and the family's ninja thing.</br>  <br>Bazz-B is fucked. Childhood friends almost never win in anime/manga.</br>  This chapter would have been 2 pages long in the pacing of any other manga. <br><br>The entire flashback would barely be half a chapter at that same pace.</br></br>  <br><br>so just retarded then</br></br>  Manga ending when? I want to get off Mr. Kubo's Wild Ride.  <br>Byakuya would be a good match I think.</br>  <br>When where you under the impression that the ride would end?</br>  <br>Yes, yes. I know. You want to know how long.<br>I'm afraid it will be  9 years. </br></br>  <br>im talking about that specific image. the passing by the side of someone while slashing them so quickly they cant see it. rukia did it against as nodt.</br>  <br>Just drop it already.<br>You MIGHT have a point if Byakuya have done it to Renji, but Ichigo has no similiarities with BB.</br></br>  Chapter 635 predictions<br> Bazz-B is lying on the floor rekt <br> Uryu appears standing over him <br> next page, Bazz wakes up somewhere bandaged <br> Uryu: "I will train you, so you could become strong enough to save Jugo" <br>Bazz=Ichigo, Uryu=Urahara</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Bazz-B training arc for 30 chapters </br>  <br>Not in one chapter.</br>  <br>Is it ever getting animated again?</br>  <br>Ichigo has to pay Jugo back for his broken bankai.</br>  <br>The fuck? No dude, Bazz-B's sole purpose was to job to show how strong Haschwald is. He was a disposable character.</br>  <br>So was Ichigo, and yet Kubo milked him for all he was worth and more.</br>  <br>Doesn't Ichigo become super sanic with his bankai I don't remember what the hell it used to do</br>  <br>How the fuck is the main character disposable? You're so stupid it hurts.</br>  <br>his original one was just gathering power to heighten his speed</br>  <br>It did initially but super speed is generally a very tricky technique for author's to work with because it can be OP. <br><br> sorry, can't hit me with your technique, too fast! <br> sorry, can't dodge my attacks, too fast! <br> sorry, you lose cause, too fast! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was plain obvious from the beginning that Rukia was meant to be the main character. Ichigo was meant to stay down and die, and Rukia would've broken out of prison and stopped Aizen's conspiracy plot. But no, Kubo turned her into a damsel in distress and Ichigo into a tool on a mission.</br>  <br> plain obvious from the beginning that Rukia was meant to be the main character <br>Literally 90% of the early story is from Ichigo's perspective.<br><br>U fucking wot</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kubo even fuckin said it. ichigo was a late addition to bleach.</br>  <br>Yeah, so? Rukia being the lead was from an old draft that got scrapped. It's clear from the final version that got published that Ichigo is supposed to be the MC.</br>  Fuck's sake people Buzzard got Bazzed to his death    <br>totally different yeah.</br>  <br>Bankai increases every stat x10 said by Yamamoto. <br><br>His bankai aside from that increased speed. <br><br>Ichigo eventually became faster since there were enemies a lot faster than that. The fact that Ichibei can cross almost 4000km in 1 second or 2 makes you realize strong shinigami are just fast as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  I just want Rukia.  <br>Are you even trying? shit bait</br>  <br><br>Here's a theory: I probably won't make it to the end of Bleach.<br><br>Before this Friend shit, I estimated early to mid 2017 as the end of Bleach. But now that Kubo's gonna flesh out backstories and shit for the remaining Quincies and Ywach in general, I can't see this ending before 2018.<br><br>I just can't see myself clinging onto life for that fucking long.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just kill yourself now</br>  <br>He did but the author non canoned that out of existence</br>  Fuck. Poor Bazz. He and Jugo still would've been friends had Yhwach not ruined their lives.  <br> oh no the writer is going to flesh out his story <br><br> i want to read bare bones crap <br><br><br>faget</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> There are faggots that believe this shit <br>Holy shit. This series has gone to shit since Aizen died yet you faggots still eat this shit up. And I refuse to believe that anyone in this thread would seriously defend the whole flashbacks during a fight scene bullshit that kubo has a hard on for</br></br></br>  <br> There are faggots that believe this shit <br><br>What? I just told you to kill yourself, you posted like you don't want to live anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>As soon as Yhwach adopted Jugo, Bazz realized they were different. It was pointless to try and reach someone of different class, and Jugo knew this.<br><br>Sounds familiar.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you dumb? Ichigo has shown superspeed like a million times. <br><br>Hell when he came back from the soul palace he showed it without bankai. <br><br>All Shinigamis have super speed using shunpo, arrancars used sonido.<br> Ichigo just has more than a lot of them when he goes Bankai, doesn't mean that there can't be people faster than him</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>poster count went up when I posted, you know.</br>    Bazz is kill? I'm sure he'll back up next chapter, don't worry lads!  <br>Super speed that was easily kept up with for the sake of what this guy said <br>And if everyone is as fast as/faster than ichigo then guess what  hes not that fast<br/> </br></br>  Can't say I was thrilled to have another flashback chapter about those two. Kubo tried to characterize them by giving them flashbacks. Problem is though, I'm only interested in flashbacks about characters I find interesting to begin with, which doesn't really apply to BuzzB and #wald. Sure, now we know more about Hashwald, who's probably going to be some kind of semi-final obstacle or last minute hero, but as of now, he's still as much fun as watching paint dry. Even his fighting style during these last 3 chapter was the same shitty teleport slash that we've seen in endless amounts so far in Bleach.<br><br>Take Zaraki for instance, or Gin. Both were cool to watch characters from the get-go and their flashbacks served to elevate their roles further, instead of haphazardly try to establish some kind of character in the first place. For instance, it would have served to have that relationship of Hashwald and BuzzB show up to a greater degree, so we could look forward to them facing of. Instead those two are thrown together and suddenly Kubo jumps out of the woodwork and yells "oh yeah, you should care about those two because of the following 3 chapter story I'm now going to tell...". There's no hype in a fated fight, when we don't know it was fated in the first place.<br><br>Doesn't help that the fight was shit and went according to Kubo's standard template of consecutive one-uppance.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You actually just gave the worst possible example with these pics. Hes not even using his bankai in these, so hes not even getting the supposed speed boost.</br></br>  <br> since Aizen died  <br>Shit, are you under Aizen's bankai right now? <br> Or am I? </br></br></br>  <br>To be fair PBR only chucked a boulder at him<br><br><br><br>Same</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I fucked up </br>  <br>They are doing some naruto anime-tier filler shit right now.<br><br>There are just way too many characters and Kubo is trying to make every one of them feel some sort of importance</br></br></br>  tfw they use a white backing when bazz dies;<br>fucking dead</br>  <br> watching naruto in the first place <br><br>fuck off. this is the arc where shit got real. take your whining back to faguto gaiden threads</br></br></br>  SANJI REDEMPTION EDITION<br><br>So now that it's confirmed that it's not Sanji vs Big Mom's crew, but Sanji vs. Bug Mom's crew and a supernova + his crew, there is only one way left for sanji to redeem himself<br><br> We see capone laughing at the strawhats <br> suddenly Sanji is stand at the front fucked more than zoro back at Thriller bark <br> capone shots him NOT dead, but Sanji is out  <br> we see that Tamago and Pekoms lie defeated behind the passed out behind sanji <br><br>That's the only possible way to not make Sanji suddenly OP, but still relevant.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Capone and his crew were looking towards the sky. It makes me think the Sunny flew away and Capone is personally going to hunt them down.  So much happening this chapter<br><br> All the rest of the supernovas confirmed okay <br> Smoker essentially admitting that he and Tashigi aren't happy with the government <br> We've seen Kaidos full shape which means he's a new character <br> Fuji possibly resigning from Admiral position </br></br></br></br></br>  If they're not already banging I'd be surprised but she's his side chick at best as Hina's his main squeeze. Though as the leader of an all male crew I can't imagine Hina isn't getting a different dick every week  <br> edition <br>Stay cancerous.</br></br>  <br><br>In reference to Smoker X Tashigi</br></br>  <br> edition </br>  I dont understand one thing…<br><br>Doffy said after the war that he would quit if the WG kept pestering him. Then he is forced to quit by Law and he shits himself.<br><br>Was he just bluffing with the WG officer back then?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Pekoms lie defeated  <br>Pekoms' bounty is just 10 million less than Doflamingo's. I am not saying he AS strong as Doflamingo... but he is Vergo's level at least for sure. He would wreck Sanji badly.<br>And Tamago is implied to be even stronger.</br></br></br>   Urouge last seen on a lightning-covered island called "Raijin island" <br> Mysterious person comes to his rest stop in the clouds <br><br>I wonder what this could mean...</br></br></br>  It felt so good to read the mangastream scan, I could finally understand what the fuck was going on.<br><br>Btw<br><br> Kidd alliance going after Shanks <br>Fucking called it. I personally think they are going to get rekt hard.</br></br></br></br></br>  KidHawPoo vs. StrawHeart when?  <br>SHIT. I forgot to mention this in my happening.</br>  <br>Shanks looks really evil there, I hope Killer defeats all of them including his own captain.</br>  Capone Bege confirmed for working for mom  <br>this makes me think that the strawheart expands with the kaido arc adding x drake so that its 3 vs 3 supernova clash. lots of subtle himts this chapter</br>  <br>Anyone who didn't think Kaido was a new character is an idiot</br>  <br><br>Do you guys think Luffy will try to defend Shanks from them?</br></br>  <br>I mentioned it because of the retards saying that he wasn't.</br>  <br> edition <br>typical release day cancer</br></br>  Have we seen every Supernova post-timeskip now?<br> Luffy, Zoro, Law: on Dressrosa <br> Kid, Killer, Apoo, Hawkins: somewhere allied <br> Bonney: stealing pizza <br> Urouge: meeting Enel <br> Capone: working for Big Mom <br> Drake: working for Kaido <br>Yup, 11 total. Everyone is back.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> nice quints </br>  <br>You mean 4x4<br> Killer vs Zoro swordfight <br> Luffy vs Kid <br> Apoo vs Law, intangible sound goes aginst his ability to rearrange things <br> Hawkins vs Drake ? <br><br>I forgot how little we know of Hawkins power</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If he even gets wind of this, he will stop at nothing to rescue the man he promised to return his strawhat to. For the sake of pottery, he will.</br>  <br> Urouge: meeting Enel <br>I'm calling it now Urouge will become a Yonkou at the end of the series called "the highest priest". OC do not steal.</br></br>  Is Bonny okay? I couldn't deal with the shitty panda translation  <br>nah luffy would do the same that he did back in thriller bark when ace was dying<br> lol I ain't helping, it's his own adventure! </br></br>  <br>Yeah, she's like:<br> "Damn, these guys are fucking shit up all over. I'm glad to be part of the same generation." </br></br>  <br> called the highest priest <br><br>I can dig it. Not original but I like it.</br></br></br>  <br> Do you guys think Luffy will try to defend Shanks from them? <br><br>No. More like wanting to fuck them up for going after Shanks first. But we won't even get that far. Scratchman's and Hawkins' crews are going to get crushed by Red Hair's crew, for hype's sake, while Killer might end up defecting, in exchange for sparing his captain's life, leaving Kidd a broken mess at some port town somewhere in the New World.</br></br></br>  /a/, you have the royalties  <br><br> what is the Impel Down arc </br></br>  <br>I'm really disappointed that all the Wizard of Oz theories don't work now without Big Mom as the Wicked Witch</br>  <br>He might be like<br> "I'm not pirate king yet. I can't face him right now." <br>Or<br> "Shanks and his guys are strong. They can handle it." <br>Or what you said.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, AFTER Ace lost. Liffy wouldn't interfere before Shanks can even fight to his heartscontent.</br>  <br><br> Implying Kaido isn't Chopper. </br></br>  <br>That's not Kaido. It's a shadow of a building in the Wano country.<br><br>You can tell by the trees, the shape, and the plot is clearly leading them there.</br></br></br>  <br>Mah nigga. Best ship</br>  <br>Did you see those horns?<br>Kaido is  Chopper's deer dad who hate from the Hito Hito no Mi Model:  Giant  Zoan</br></br>  <br><br>Hereee's Kaido</br></br>  <br> mfw <br><br>Would that be the ultimate twist in anything ever?</br></br></br>  <br><br>I doubt Wano is a winter island.<br><br>It was Kaido, he is huge as fuck. He probably prefers winter islands because his Zoan form is an animal that likes cold(?)</br></br></br></br>  It's time to Post your 3 worst theories /a/ !<br><br> Kaido is a dwarf with Dragon Zoan. <br><br> Big Mom fell in love with sanji and want him to cook for her eternally. <br><br> Doflamingo is    Sanji's father  </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>how can it be enel? Isn't he on the moon?</br>  <br>kaido is a beetle</br>  <br> I doubt Wano is a winter island. <br><br>It's Japan with a population that are immune to colds. Shit just got real.</br></br></br>  I don't like new Akainu's look. He was scarier and more stern looking when he was cleanly shaved. He looked like a super-powerful lawyer which he is supposed to be. <br>Now with beard and cigar he looks like some mafia boss. Not very fitting for the face of justice.</br>  <br>he got there, he can get back</br>  <br>He always had the Yakuza look</br>  <br>Why are all the Yonkou such huge motherfuckers? What do they put in the NW's water?</br>  <br>you are right</br>  <br>pic related<br><br><br> implying Eneru will have anything to do with the world of the humans again <br>A god should behave like one and not interfere with the wars of filthy humans.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Luffy wants to capture it. <br> He befriends it. <br>Could be fun but anticlimatic</br></br></br>  <br>other than big thing in the mist the silhouettes don't really match</br>  <br> Kaido is an ant zoan </br>  <br>Fitting for his justice.</br>  <br>Oda always change the designs of character that only appeared as silhouettes. Look at Blackbeard during Drum's arc and Kanjurou during early dressrosa and you'll see.</br>  <br><br>Dunno, the only "normal" one is Shanks. And even with one arm he is strong as fuck.<br><br>The other 3 seem like heartless monsters</br></br></br></br>  <br>Worst like dumbest or worst ones you still like?<br><br>My favorite bad one is that Monet died and her fruit respawned on one of Nami's tangerines. Someone unknowingly eats it</br></br></br>  <br>Any idea why they are specifically going after shanks? i thought shanks was pretty chill and just drink and eat food all day.</br>  <br><br><br><br> &gt;Urouge: meeting Enel <br><br>Time to share it.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Anc<wbr>wu_9KFTk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If he's so chill then they might think he's the easier target</br>  <br>because shanks is the only one not involved in the story yet<br><br>and blackbeard is end game so cant get him yet</br></br></br>  <br><br>Same with Kaido's human form. First it was the mustache guy and then this one with the mask.</br></br>  <br>Vergo is alive and ate the Axolotl Devil fruit to regenerate himself.</br>  <br><br>Nobody would be dumb enough to go against Blackbeard who has like a billion DF powers. Also, Kuzan.</br></br>  <br>it's not a mask. but yeah the design changed</br>  <br>thats hajrudin</br>  woah<br><br>first request page that doesn't have "crew member interacts with animal"</br></br>  I BELIEVE IN FUJITORA  <br> Big Mom fell in love with sanji and want him to cook for her eternally <br>I like it.</br></br>  <br>pinocchio and tengu are animals.</br>  <br>technically, Usopp is interacting with Chopper</br>  <br> there are people who didn't think Zatoichi is a badass </br>  <br><br>He always looked like a Mafia (or rather, Yakuza) boss</br></br>  Holy shit this chapter was fucking good. I didn't think we'd get into between-arc worldbuilding for another chapter or two. <br> Fujitora giving no fucks and not backing down <br> Gorousei all upset <br> randoms mad about loss of Smile so Law and Luffy are going to be in even MORE danger <br> Kaidou has beetle-like horns so he might actually be a beetle zoan  <br> Kuzan involved with Blackbeard (reminded me of the anon who actually called that) but I wonder why he's involved with Blackbeard <br><br><br>That's a Leviathan. I think it is supposed to be explained but who knows when.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>guise, what if kaido is a beetle zoan?</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit am I only the second one checking them?</br>   mfw this chapter alone is more interesting than all Dressrosa chapters combined   <br>Kuzan probably works with blackbeard to either set him up or to get something out of it. Maybe it's to sabotage the navy?</br>  <br>Oh and I forgot one of the most important bits<br> Smoker + Friends going to Vegapunk's laboratory <br> VEGAPUNK'S LAB <br>Maybe we'll get our VEGAPUNK reveal soon? HYPE</br></br></br></br>  <br>he's fat after all</br>  <br>Ussop sniping Sugar was better.</br>  <br>stop exaggerating like a faggot</br>  <br>Where do you ducks even come up with this shit?</br>   Akainu gets shit on by his superiors AND subordinates   <br> Thread is mainly discussion and speculation instead of rampant shitposting <br>This is truly a Christmas miracle.</br></br>  Even Akainu is mad at the Gorosei<br><br>Shieeeeeet.</br></br>  with all these reveals and new info, what can we expect for 800?<br><br> kaido <br> vegapunk <br> sanji and co <br> new bounties </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Barely did shit to help with the battle in Dressrosa precisely because he wanted to show how powerless and corrupt Marine "justice" really was <br> Makes an open apology on behalf of the Marines specifically to avoid another Alabasta situation <br> effectively renounces his position as Admiral and talks mad shit straight to Akainu <br><br>this nigga right here</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Luffy.</br></br>  <br>Marine/WG Civil War arc when?</br>  <br>Here, you dense prick.</br>   Fujitora already telling Akainu to eat shit <br>he really knows how to pick them</br>  <br>notice the flag? that was on big mom's ship. its already been discussed and confirmed in previous thread you fucking speedreading faggot</br>  Where are all the "hurrrrrrr why does Fujitora not defeat Doflamingo?" faggots now?  <br>It's great.</br>  <br><br>Look at the page again. Plus, they are going after Caesar.</br></br>  YO YO YO WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT SHIT ABOUT KUZAN JOINING UP WITH BLACKBEARD  Reminder that Kaido is this  <br>I hope it's Vegapunk. That's one of the BIG reveals. Would be fucking awesome to have it now.<br><br><br>Interesting. Thanks, anon.<br><br><br> speedreading <br>I don't remember every flag design. Sorry, boss.  No sarcasm. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What if that's the 7th Shichibukai?</br>  <br>Another fucking retarded slowpoke</br>  <br><br>Doffy has the upper hand of WG because he knows about the hidden treasure in Mariejoas. He could ask the WG anything and blackmail them threatening to tell the world everything.<br><br>Doffy only shat himself because he was afraid that Kaidou would kill him, not because Law demanded him to resign from Schichibukai. He had a plan how to take down both Luffy and Law knowing they would come to Dressrosa, but as we all know the plan failed.</br></br></br></br>  So it's Fujitora vs Alliance next. How the hell is he gonna justify this in the public's eye now? He already bowed and made a spectacle of admitting that he fucked up and now he's gonna fight the nation's greatest hero?<br><br>what the hell?</br></br>  <br>YO YO YO YO KUZAN GOT A GRUDGE AGAINST SAKAZUGAY<br>BLACKBEARD PROLLY TRYNA START SOME SHIT WITH THE WG<br>OR KUZAN JUST FUCKIN WIT HIM; SET HIM UP FOR A FALL</br></br></br>  <br>ooo</br>  <br>He's not, learn reading comprehension.</br>  <br> yfw Vegapunk is a wacky mad/scientist whose whole gimmick is that he's clumsy but genius </br>  <br>He's not going to go after the Straw Hats and Law.</br>   The Marines are puppets of the World Government <br> World Government are puppets of the Celestial Dragons <br> Celestial Dragons reside at what is known as the holy land Mariejois (Heaven) <br> Celestial Dragons = Gods <br> D = Devils = God natural enemy  <br><br>Full circle.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit learn to read</br>  <br>can you not read or was the panda translation THAT bad</br>  <br>I'm curious to see the leaders of the Tenryuubito.</br>   implying Fujitora will not be Luffy's nakama   <br> or was the panda translation THAT bad <br>it was, oh god it was</br></br>  <br>Doffy is restrained by sea stone right now. Akainu could just melt him right now, or for 2 weeks straight if Doffy tries some Armament Haki shit.<br>Now if he has some contacts on standby ready to leak the secret, then Doffy would have an edge. But right now, no.</br></br>  Shanks is going to wreck Kid <br><br>Just like how Whitebeard wrecked Crocodile.<br><br>Actually i'm betting Shanks will send Rockstar up against Kid just for the shits and giggles</br></br></br></br>  <br>Welcome to... I don't know, 6 years ago?</br>  <br>bring their heads back, I will wait for you<br><br>Just what I want to hear.</br></br></br>  everybody keep in mind this is LITERALLY 3 days after Straw Hats 2 year absence. they shat all over the New World in less than half a week getting CP0, Big Mom, and Kaido after em in the process.<br><br>they're probably gonna get one piece by the end of the week at this rate.</br></br>  <br><br>During Law's speech at Punk Hazard all of the Yonko were shadowed.</br></br>  <br>He might be sarcastic about the "friends" part, he might be not. But Ceasar is also important to Kaido. So whether he's working for Law, Big Mom, Kaido, himself or someone else entirely is still up to debate.</br>  So how many more "world reaction" chapters to you think we have left? I feel like there's just going to be one, and the rest will be Dressrosa chapters.  Why does Akainu still look like a normal admiral?  <br>This week's panda was Xusasu Basasu level.</br>  <br>Probably true, seeing how Tashigi wants to take the kids to him. And I don't think Vegapunk is another Caesar who those fucked up experiments, because Tashigi couldn't be so evil as to deliver him children to torture.</br>  <br>Did they not include the second part of that dialogue?</br>  <br>Yeah, you can't read.</br>  So fuji vs trastraw next chapter?  <br>What are you talking about they partied for a week at fishmen island</br>  <br>Fujitora is basically saying:<br> "Yeah, eat shit, sakazugay!" </br></br>  <br> yfw the big twist is Fujitora as next straw hat </br>  <br>It deserved the royalties.</br>  <br>That's what he did all chapter.<br><br>Fujitora confirmed for currently owning a pair of the biggest balls in One Piece world.</br></br></br>  <br>nah nigga this was pain of sabo and issho's victory on steroids. did panda's translator have a stroke mid-translating?</br>  I feel bad for Akainu. The WG mocks him and Fujitora talks back to him after he chose him to become an admiral.<br><br><br>edit of 'just fuck my shit up' Sakazuki when?</br></br></br>  <br>not happening<br><br>he meant that he doesn't give a shit about being essentially renounced of his title</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that's way more clear than what Panda had. Was oarticularly shitty this week.</br>  <br>speedreader aint you? they left the day after they arrived and punk hazard that same day. confirmed by camie requesting a day off to see them off</br>  <br> Oda said the next straw hat would be an "ancient leader" in an old interview <br>Goddamn it.</br></br>  <br> feeling bad for the man who killed ace <br>nah fuck him</br></br>  At what point do you think will we get to see Green Ox in action? What will his action be?  <br>Well its no surprise to know that some supernovas are teaming with Yonkous.<br>As Law said "The only way of living in the New World is teaming with a Yonkou or fighting them"</br></br>  <br> trusting anime with anything </br>  <br>where did he say that? thatd be huge news for speculation</br>  <br><br>We might see one more "world reaction" chapter. Maybe one more "good ruler comes back into power" chapter, a "party" chapter and a "new threat" chapter, followed by an "escape" chapter. Then a big reveal at chapter 800. I'm hoping Kaido, but I'ld be happy to see Big Mom in full doing something too.</br></br>  <br>Akainu status : Fracture Anus</br>  <br>Now I really wonder who the Gorosei actual are, since they dont seem to be Celestial Dragons</br>  <br>no idea, The color and animal motifs were easy to identify in the original admirals, but Fujitora's been full of surprises.<br><br>only thing we can probably reliably speculate would be which old Japanese actors to expect his design to based on.</br></br></br>  <br>this exactly<br><br>no sympathy for the man who killed best boy</br></br></br>  <br>I'm searching it. At the time everyone assumed it was Jinbei.</br>  <br>would be interesting if he went for someone recent like ken watanabe</br>  <br>Yeah, I made a similar post earlier.<br><br>Seems that they're strictly the WG leaders but not involved in any royalty or nobility.</br></br></br>  Why the hell do we still not know the name of Fuji's DF?  <br>jesus christ, dressrosa really will end up taking 100 chapters. wano will probably be 150</br>  <br>Wasn't that for Marine Ford ? Like "the next person to help Luffy will be an ancient enemy" ?</br>  <br>Because super serious people don't name their attacks "fruit fruit _____"</br>  <br>What makes you think he has a devil fruit? Maybe it is just really good observation haki.</br>  <br> fujitora next strawhat <br> jinbe will come back <br> luffy will reunite with sanji and the others <br> law alliance <br> the samurai guys <br><br>there are too many characters in this shit, oda can't give them all the panel time they deserve so next arc will be another clusterfuck like dressrosa (not that I didn't like it), with throwaway enemies being defeated in one or two panels by one of the millions of good guys and if they separate it will be years before we see the other half of the group like sanji's group is being handled right now</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>cause he aint a poser than needs to name his attacks or always introduce his DF in a fight.</br>  <br> good ruler comes back into power <br>Somewhat speaking of, I noticed one of the panels had someone using weapons from Loflumingo to fight. I wonder if it could have been a group trying to get its country back, or civil war, or any other number of plausible incidents. The group had to surrender since they could no longer get weapons.</br></br>   mfw Akainu realizes Fuji is about to fuck him up and buster calls Dressrosa next chapter <br><br> I know it's never going to happen, but I would love it </br></br>  <br>Its going to be Toshiro Mifune as Yojimbo<br> hard exterior, bad attitude <br> mischievous <br> violent, enjoys fighting <br> ambivalent with a reluctant sense of duty <br>I think he'd be a perfect foil to Fujitora, though there'd be some overlap with Kizaru's personality<br><br><br>Are you serious?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> edit of 'just fuck my shit up' sakazuki when? <br><br>I tried.</br></br></br>  <br>They're already there nigga, maybe we will continue to see the kids with Vegapunk<br>HYPE</br></br>  <br><br> Haki controlling fucking meteorites </br></br>  <br> Are you serious? <br>No, of course not. Why can't we be silly anymore?</br></br>  <br><br>eternal fuccboi<br><br> gets shat on by a half-dead Whitebeard <br> shanks makes him soil his pants <br> can only defeat someone relevant from behind or when he has elemental advantage <br> WG slaps him back into bitchboy status <br> Fujitora gives him major burns </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What can buster calls possibly do against the current power levels? Fucking Barto can solo the buster call and sink the whole fleet.</br>  <br>Re-read that page. They have a few days left until they reach his lab.</br>  <br>He is going to be a nice old man that's great with kids<br>but has a plan to destroy the world</br></br>  <br><br>Yea sry, I kinda meant "had" not "has". <br><br>Luffy and Law made huge favor for WG here.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Akainu status: loins on lava </br>  <br>Because people are legitimately stupid in these threads and I can't tell whats a joke. Look how many people seriously didn't know Kuzan was with Blackbeard</br>  <br>imagine if it is Coby<br><br> anon stop being retarded that is impossible <br><br>a man can dream</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>op discussions are serious business<br><br>also fujitora singlehandedly shut all the fujifags AND doffyfags in one chapter. good day to be a op reader</br></br></br>  <br>not bad as a first try.<br><br> that filename </br></br></br>   produced by FEEL <br>Wtf is this shit? I thought after Yahari they would have more budget and reputation to land a good series, not this titty crap</br>  SAOTS  AOTYAY        <br>That ass ia outrageous.</br>    When will /a/ realize that high budget anime does not automatically mean you'll enjoy it?<br><br>Hyouka is shitty and boring yet it's budget is high as fuck</br></br>    <br>Made for doggystyle and painting her butt, back, cleavage and face white.</br>    <br><br> not fucking her butt and then spraying your load all over her face <br><br>pleb</br></br></br></br>  <br>Buttsex can hurt the girl.<br><br>In vaginal sex both parties enjoy it.</br></br></br>  <br><br> implying vaginal sex can't be damaging <br><br>If she's a slut maybe</br></br></br></br>  <br> Buttsex can hurt the girl. <br><br>You're supposed to be good enough to make her enjoy it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I like when the other girl also enjoys it.<br>I want her to be happy to enjoy  gap moe. <br><br> Besides I bet she fucks like a Goddess and the contrast of semen on dark skin is sex. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is a good series.</br>  <br>What about Ushinawareta?</br>  Would your dick survive an orgy with all of them?  <br> Wtf <br><br>Fuck off, newfag.</br></br></br>  Yeah, needs more washing boards  Paladin reminds me of Celia from Walkure Romanze. I want to fuck Paladin.  <br><br>Do you even know the first thing about how anime studios work?</br></br>  <br>He's posting on /a/, so no, obviously he doesn't.</br>  <br>You know anon she can't have sex, she'd lose her powers.<br><br>At most you'd get a titjob, but if a penis enters inside of her (blowjob, butt or vagina), she's out.</br></br></br>    <br>15 minute episode and my dick is not entertained.</br>  Why is Charlotte so smug?  <br>You know, even if you don't take the pandering into account, can you really call the love child of Light and Lelouch an original character?</br>  I was raging so hard while watching this. Why are Charlotte and teleporting dude such dicks  <br> stopping a reckless asshole from cheating, lying, taking advantage of people and putting others in danger  <br>Who is the dick again?</br></br>  <br>Hey, I'm just expanding what /a/ liking about this MC. I'm just clearing it to you.<br><br><br>Of course, don't you see all that calculating, sinister yet have a good heart MC in all those romcom-triangle-NOT-forced-drama show, and NOT-shitty-LN-adaptation?<br><br>They definitely not the same as this show MC. Because this MC is original 10/10 MC.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I feel like you're trying a bit too hard. You gotta be a bit more subtle if you want other trolls to catch on.</br></br>  Last thread is kill as expected.<br><br>So let's try again. Is mr.hands going to win the Orimotobowl?</br></br>  <br>That may be the case, but what about Yukino's thoughts about 8man?<br><br>Will she be able to stand as a partner for him? One sided relationships are a recipe for disaster and there's not enough time to properly fix her to the point of being dating material, and the same could be said for Yui.<br><br>As I am a Yukinofag, I'm sad to admit the only viable choice as of now would be  Iroha </br></br></br></br></br>  So which one does 8man prefer? <br>If he's all about being genuine and wanting the real thing why doesn't he say something?</br>  <br>To clarify: with "one-sided" I meant relationship where one parts lays on the other without being able to provide proper support.</br>  <br>8man prefers  Buy vol 12 </br>  <br>8man is an idiot.</br>  Thoughts on Dandelion so far? It has fairly unique concept but its execution is absurd as fuck. The characters are pretty decent and cute especially Kanade and Hikari. Above average show.  <br>Wait, why wouldn't he want Kanade to win? Also, what Akane blabbering in the end was because she's jealous? jealous of what?</br>  Who is this tuxedo temptress?  <br>I'm guessing they did the confession chapter this episode? Cute.</br>  <br> He doesn't want Kanade to win because she wants to win for him. At least she says that later on I think Shuu knows already though. And Akane is jealous of Satou </br>  <br>I guess its related to his injured leg.<br><br>For jelly Akane it was after Satou left them she was angry at him and Shuu was being dense.<br><br>The part at the end Akane was still a little angry at Shuu but it was mostly about her being confused about what was happening in the election</br></br></br></br></br>  Post Type Moon, if you're not a nerd.  <br>With Saber&amp;Caster the gender doesn't really matter.</br>  <br> Gawain <br>He literally says in CCC he has a Curtain of Night that counters whatever Gawain can do anon.</br></br>  <br>You can counter Avalon by walking away. There were a lot of factors in play that let Saber counterattack, one of which involved getting knocked out.</br>  <br> Gawain, <br><br>Gilgamesh literally threatens Gawain with the Curtain of Night in CCC, which can remove his buffs.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Extra is literally what Nasu was able to salvage from what it was something even more horrible by Marvelous.<br><br>It's obvious on how Twice's entry in the Extra Material is far better and gives far more insight on him than what happens in the actual game. It also makes him and the MC really interesting.</br></br></br></br>  NEVER EXPLAINED  <br> bowing to a used goods slut </br>  <br>This particular drawing of Piruluk makes her so sexual. I want to squeeze those thighs while hugging her and licking her neck.</br>  <br>wow rude</br>    <br> being gay </br></blockquote>]
