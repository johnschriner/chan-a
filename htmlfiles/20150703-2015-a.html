[ It's the 3rd, at least text spoilers soon.  <br>You're the shitmirfag aren't you. It's so obvious.</br>  <br>I hate Shitmir. Did you misquote.</br>  What the fuck is happening in this thread?  <br>YHfag.</br>  <br>Just Arminfags.</br>  Does /a/ like ear cleaning?<br>I don't know what it is, but every time I'm lucky enough to see an ear cleaning scene in a show, I reach peak comfiness. I've only seen a very small handful of scenes, so most of my fix comes from artwork.</br>  <br><br>autistic-anon please leave. having someone else stick wooden sticks in your ear is way more dangerous than doing it yourself. you're acting like a fool.</br></br>  <br>But doctors do recommend hydrogen peroxide</br>  <br> having someone else stick wooden sticks in your ear is way more dangerous than doing it yourself <br><br>If they're completely inept, yeah.<br>Otherwise they probably know what they're doing, and you as the cleanee should be sure that they know what they're doing. How is this so hard for you to grasp?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually, all of you are autistic and barely even know what you're talking about. The wooden earpicks with cotton ends you see in anime and fanart are now more of a novelty than anything; it's easier, more comfortable, and more hygienic to use metal/plastic/rubber ones. Also, pic related is one of the many reasons why you can actually trust someone to put a stick in your ear. If there's no flashlight in the earpick, usually you just bring a lamp over instead and that works just as well.<br><br>Also, Asians have drier earwax which can be more itchy and uncomfortable to have in the ear. It builds up easily so it's more convenient to just pick it out rather than to go to the doctor every time your ear is itchy. My boyfriend asks me to pick her ear every single time he sees me, and I can vouch that a ton of flaky earwax can build up in just one day.</br></br></br>  <br> they probably know what they're doing <br>If they think cleaning out ears with a stick is a good idea, they probably don't.</br></br>   2nd season inspired by Atto's countryside slice-of-life manga debuts on July 6 <br> Non Non Biyori! </br>  surprise, motherfucker  <br>It's time.</br>  <br>Why do you call her Honkers?<br>I'm really looking forward to their reunion. If she's not in S2 I will be very upset.</br></br>  <br>I hope they just abandon the source material and turn this into his harem</br>  Who is best Biyori and why is it Komari?  Biyori Ch. 39 TL is out.  <br> Andate a la puta que te pari√≥, hack de mierda. </br>  <br>Fuck off la Kuro.</br>  <br>such a super bitch. I did really like Naoko and Chiyoko.</br>  A sample of one of the extras. Not sure why Ritz left a large empty space beside Hajime.  <br>Okinawan are bunch of asshole right? What does this tell about Ritz.</br>  Ace knew that Sabo was alive?  <br>keep posting like a buttmad autist and then enjoy your ban</br>  <br> everything I wrote earlier still applies </br>  Why is Kyros so perfect?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Kud<wbr>8tej6_jk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> Yes, but this came after the Sabo reveal of his existence <br>No it came before. It's the cover of chapter 596.</br></br>  <br>and that your threads get deleted also still applies</br>  HQ Cover. Its not up on Haimura's site or Dengeki's site. Was found on Amazon.    <br>If DB needs to make an anime of something and JC Staff has cash to burn.</br>  <br>I wish there was someone on /a/ with cool kinematic typography skittles to remake this. Looks like it was made in paint.</br>  <br>It's a remnant from before webms were supported on 4chan. If you're volunteering yourself, go apeshit.</br>  Your picks for the best boy and best girl of this series?  They trying to hard to do some fanservice...  I've got this yesterday on the mail. Awaiting for vol 13 to come out next week and order it.<br><br>Remember when the threads were all laughs and no shitters? Those were the days.</br></br>  <br>Nice meme you fucking idiot</br>  <br>can you scan the full cover of the volume 8 to 12 ?</br>  <br>The fanservice jokes got old fast. I'm glad they stopped being so repetitive with them.</br>  <br>The fanservice never went away</br>  What went wrong?  <br>I like 3 the most, the boots look good with the long skirt.</br>  <br> skipping leg day <br> lewd short skirt <br>worthless whore</br></br></br>  <br>But the long skirt wasn't the result of an era. There were girls with short skirts everywhere when Tsukihime came out, even in the VN itself (Sacchin).<br><br>That made the long skirt all the more unique, and added to her character. As usual though, the japs ruin everything with their demand for slut attire.</br></br></br>  <br>Better Akiha could teach her how to stay healthy and sexy.</br>  <br> The long skirt gave her a more interesting, distinguishable appearance. <br>Yeah, maybe for a faggot like you.</br></br>  so, is it shit?  <br> watching not-quite-porn by a porn author. <br>I don't like being constantly being teased.<br>If I want porn, I'll use their actual porn works.</br></br></br>  Damn son, can't wait for /a/ to lose it's collective shit and starts shitposting as if the fate of the world depended on it when those two edgy little kids pop up.  <br>They won't be watching by that point, if it even covers that much.</br>  <br>What are Doujins?</br>  <br>Based on your response, you didn't understand my post at all.</br>  Who the fuck is this?<br>She appeared in a few background shots in the first episode and now I'm almost done with the first season and she hasn't appeared since. Except for in the opening of course.</br>  <br>secret best girl.</br>  She's a normalfag  Katanashi's girlfriend.  <br>She a self proclaimed normal girl. They all think she is weird like all of them.</br>  <br>Her character not being important is the joke. The whole point is that she (thinks) she's the only normal person in the restaurant, so she doesn't interact with the others. She shows up pretty often actually as a random server in the store, but she only has lines in one the last episode of each season.</br>  ITT: Anime with a criminally small amount of porn if any.  <br> girls <br> pure <br>All females are sinful dogs that need to be tamed with a good dicking.</br></br></br>  <br>Also there's the fact that a lot of it is shit. Why do popular shows always have a lot of shit.</br>        Read the guide before asking questions: http://buyfag.moe  <br>Man I'm a sucker for gradients, looks fantastic</br>  <br>nice, her hair is more yellow in person but still the figure is pretty good. am pleased</br>  <br>What was the last koto fig that keeps flying off the shelves and went up in price?</br>  <br>http://www.muji.us/store/stationery<wbr>/desk-acc/recycled-paper-word-card.<wbr>html</wbr></wbr></br>  <br><br>Now I'm just waiting for http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>287874 to be released or at least properly announced</wbr></br></br>  What's the best anime ever and why is it pic related?  <br> you will never be this fucking autistic <br><br>That's a relief.</br></br></br>  <br> pic related <br><br>There will NEVER be another character as hilarious as Mr Satan.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Why aren't you watching anime right now?</br></br></br>  <br>Because I hate my life and try to forget about things by shitposting on /a/.</br>  <br>Kek you're a bitch.<br><br>This isn't an anime yet but best hero ever.</br></br></br>  14 HOURS<br>4<br><br>H<br>O<br>U<br>R<br>S<br><br>I cant contain myself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>8 MORE HOURS</br>  <br>Learn Japanese, clean up while listening to the OST so you have a nice clean place to watch Symphogear, prepare snacks, stare at the countdown, there's lot's to do.</br>  <br>When are BDs never the proper option?<br><br> Download them overnight, rewatch Episode 13 before GX airs, then watch the rest tomorrow </br></br></br>  <br>rewatch it all again</br>  I'm still jealous.  ITT: Burgers in anime  <br>At least your heart will thank you for not coming back there.</br>  <br>Fascinating.</br>  <br>That actually looks very tasty.</br>    </blockquote>]
