[ Occasional reminder that you should always skip the first episode of this show.  I won't because the creators wanted it to be this way  Place your bets gentlemen.  i bet on that psycho kid he only kills shit while nicolas started to like bitches that makes him soft  rip in peace Daiz  Ncolas best girl  http://gangsta-project.com/news.php<wbr>#post136<br><br>Looks like ABC Asahi won't air episode 5 today but next week instead because of sports. Other TV channels (Tokyo MX and TV Aichi) is still going to air episode 5 on their usual schedule which is next Sunday.<br><br>This schedule change also makes Tokyo MX and TV Aichi are going to air this series 3 days earlier than ABC Asahi.<br><br>I wonder if Funi will still somehow leak it today because they are incompetent.</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr>  I bet on the monkey.  <br>Well that's depressing.</br>  <br>There's goes my day. Hopefully Funi delivers.</br>   New simulcast episodes Sundays at 10:30 am Eastern. <br>Did Funi always say this?<br>Because that's what it says on the gangsta page now. Seems like conformation of delay</br></br>  We all know Nick can't lose, he's got an albino man-wife and a whore kid to come home to.<br><br>But betting on whether Funi is better at being incompetent, or better at not giving people what they want, now that's an interesting bet.<br><br>My money is on disappointment.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Did Funi always say this? <br>It is always like that despite Funi released episode 2 on Thursday and episode 3 and 4 on Wednesday.<br><br>Although their simulcast schedule now shown Gangsta episode 5 will be on 8/02/15 so I guess they had to change it back to Sundays because of this airing delay in Japan.</br></br></br></br>  How many minutes left til live?  Place your bets, will Daiz deliver episode 3 before the series ends?  <br>Four days.</br>  Japanese twitter makes it seem like it's actually airing today.  <br>neither of them win. best girls show up and Doug ("psycho kid") does not even want to fight lol. hes scared of the three laws</br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if this is "stalled" like Barakamon and iM@S CG.</br>  <br>BS11 aired episode 4 earlier. <br><br>I like how ABC Asahi started as the leading channel for this and now they become the last channel for this because of this delay.</br></br></br>  so are we gonna get an episode today ?  <br>No, unless Funi somehow leaked it.</br>  <br> this money <br>Sasuga crunchysubs.</br></br>  <br>Fuck this shit</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128759876 <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128759876 <br> hating sports  <br>Shut up and give me your lunch money, nerdboy.</br></br>  <br>Prayer circle.</br>   Whorick is watching you masturbate   <br>What sports?

Holy fucking shit.<br><br>Also, eventually I just had to give up entirely on understanding anything that was happening on every Bucciarati fight.<br><br>Anyway, I'd rank the parts up to now as:<br>4 = 3 &gt; 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; 5 &gt; 1</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Gay Priest is here now.  <br> every Bucciarati fight <br>Are you sure you don't mean every Diavolo fight? Cause compared to King Crimson, Sticky Fingers' power makes total sense.</br></br>  <br>Have fun with 6. It's interesting having a girl MC in Jojo.<br> I just had to give up entirely on understanding anything that was happening on every Bucciarati fight. <br>He puts zippers on things. He can open them and separate things/open things. Fights are easy to understand when you know what the stands do.<br>Pic related.<br>Also the parts are 4=7&gt;2&gt;1&gt;6&gt;5&gt;3<br>8 excluded since it hasn't ended.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>(Not OP) The one thing I never got about Sticky Fingers is why sometimes putting a zipper on things opening up some weird voidspace where you could hide stuff, and why sometimes the zipper would lead to the other side of the object. Does it depend on how thick the surface is? Is it based on which one would help Buccelati more at the time?</br>  <br>Oh, I just thought of another one. How come Buccelati can hide a cell phone in his own head, but splitting apart his heart is suddenly a problem?</br>  I just finished part 3<br>Why hasn't any Jojo had a brother or sister yet?</br>  I skipped part 5 till we get better translations/scans.  <br>Because then we'd have more than one MC. Don't worry though, you'll get your wish in Part 6. Giorno has a few half-brothers that show up working for Pucci.</br>  <br>Giorno has half-brothers<br>Johnny Joestar had a brother<br><br>I'd think he decides that when he uses the ability. Like he'd just think "I want the zipper to go all the way to the other side". Maybe it's based on how hard he hits the object. As in you can easily tell how much strength you need to lightly grab a balloon rather than gripping it so hard you pop it<br><br>The space isn't the actual inside the object, otherwise he couldn't hide in the person when he first means Giorno. Splitting your heart up means the parts can't function, he essentially cut his heart up and then sewed it back together.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but if he can hide inside someone and keep a phone in his head, why would dividing his heart up even be an issue. Aside from that one organ, dividing any other part of his body doesn't seem to matter, even if they'd be immediately vital, like the brain.</br>  <br> Dio <br> Holly <br> Ungalo, Rykiel, Donatello <br> Nicholas <br> Kira's sister in part 8 technically counts <br>Those are all the jojo siblings</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I haven't read part 5 in awhile but did he ever do something like take off his head? I pretty sure the reason is that the blood can't be pumped through his body and such and that's why it's an issue. The void inside the object may not be part of the object but if he unzips something the 2+ parts can't interact with the body.<br>I'm just making shit up as I go I'm not Araki so if my shits all retarded that's why.<br> the reason it's taking me so long to write up this shit is that I woke up 11hrs ago at 1am so I'm getting a lil tired </br></br></br>  <br>Not quite, Sticky Fingers had some weird elements to it, Like what exactly happens when he used the zipper on the ground? It wouldn't connect to anything, and Buccelatti did that a couple of times but it was never explained, Araki just drew a black hole inside it, are we supposed to assume its leads to some blank dimension Buccelati can just hang out before using his zipper somewhere else or what? Makes no sense really.</br>  <br>Except Dio isn't a blood sibling which is probably what  was asking, and Holly is so insignificant outside of being Part 3's damsel in distress that she doesn't really count.</br>  <br> 1 above anything <br>Nope.</br></br>  <br>You're right, let me fix that.<br>4=7&gt;2&gt;6&gt;5&gt;3=1<br>To clarify part 6 is without the ending.<br>2&gt;1&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;3  <br>For anime only</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think so</br>  <br>Zipper dimension dude. Remember he unzipped a bathroom and put a bunch of treasure in there before zipping it back up? No one can fucking get that treasure ever. They could demolish the fucking bathroom and he could sticky finger the area near the treasure and get that shit out. Sticky finger zipper man is the best thing in part 5.</br>  <br>Honestly, I read part 5 a while ago, and after finding out some of the memes about it, I was really confused on why people couldn't get what King Crimson did.<br><br>4&gt;5&gt;1&gt;3&gt;6&gt;2</br></br></br>  <br>If you're so enlightened, care to explain it in a way that covers all the weird shit like Buccelati seeing his past/future self?</br>  <br>King Crimson erases time, that's a given. The interactions of things during that time are also erased, and the only thing that remains after it is the movement that happens in it. Using Epitath, Diavolo can see into those ten second and use King Crimson accordingly.<br><br>The whole thing with Buccelati seeing his past/future self is  bizarre , and doesn't show up again if I remember right. The only way it would work is if Buccelati somehow saw the insides of Diavolo's bangs, which could honestly be something that happened.<br><br>This is all of course assuming that my memory is holding up in regards to VA.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He erases the cause but not the effect</br>  The final fight in part 5 really sucked. It's a shame because they built up Diavolo so much and King Crimson was a cool stand.  <br>I'm pretty sure he never actually uses it to kill someone, which he could if that was the case. Is there actually an instance where the effect remains?</br>  This fight was awesome as fuck.  <br>It was really anti-climactic, yeah. Really wish that GER wouldn't have been so strong as to curbstomp Diavolo like that. Just nullify the time erasure, and let Giorno and Diavolo fight it out in real time.</br>   all these niggas rating part 6 better that part 5 <br>/a/ is retarded, I'm not even surprised.</br>  <br>Part 5 is shit and Giorno is shit. I don't get why people think a different translation will make him seem like he was actually doing shit. Fucker didn't earn GER at all, he just lucked into that shit.</br>  <br>I know you are buttblasted by Jotaro fucking up,but part 6 is far more consistent and has a vastly better protagonist,villain and side characters than part 5.</br>  <br> better protagonist <br>No. Jolyne a shit, dumb protagonist and a whore<br><br> better villain <br>No. Diavolo is one of the best villains in the series<br><br> better side characters <br>Yes, that's true.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Does anyone else fucking hate Karera  <br> No. Jolyne a shit, dumb protagonist and a whore <br>Doesn't matter, she's better than fucking "I have a dreeeam" Giorno. Unless you're talking about Bruno when you say part 5 protag, which I could see being better than Jolyne</br></br>  <br>Diavolo is as weak a character as can be.<br>He would be fine as a random villain, but it doesn't make any sense that the secret boss of the organization would be as insane as he is without losing all secrecy about his identity.</br></br>  <br> No. Diavolo is one of the best villains in the series <br>Literally retarded: the villain. Everything he does is fucking retarded,his whole behaviour is inconsistent and stupid. His only good trait is that he's sexy.</br></br>  <br><br>Diavolo is a fucking drug dealer and junkie. He's moved by greed and his addiction. There are many people like that in our world. I find him an awesome villain for that.</br></br>  <br> No. Jolyne a shit, dumb protagonist and a whore <br>Very nice arguments but Jolyne had to put up with a lot of insanely overpowered stands with a Hierophant-green tier stand. She's by far one of the most competent jojos and you're likely blaming her for the universe rewrite when it was entirely Jotaro's fault.</br></br>  <br>Eh he's not as good as Kira who is motivated by his fetish for hands on a beautiful dwang. There are many people like that in our world. I find him an unsettling villain for that.</br>  <br> She's by far one of the most competent jojos <br>I'll give you this. She sure knows how to use what she has.<br><br> and you're likely blaming her for the universe rewrite when it was entirely Jotaro's fault. <br>But this is straight bullshit. Not that anon, but there are more reasons to disliking her than just the universal rewrite. Jolyne faggots are honestly one of the biggest shitters in this entire fanbase, only being surpassed by meme posters.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was Jotaro's fault Made in Heaven and even C-Moon were completely out of Stone Free's power to actually fight, Star Platinum was pretty much their only hope.</br>  <br>Did you even read the post? I don't care about the rewrite, I just don't like Jolyne as a character as much as I like almost anyone else in JoJo.</br>  <br><br>What? Is this opposite day? The side characters and stand fights are make part 5 better than 6.</br></br>  <br>Why would you hate Karera?</br>  <br> are we supposed to assume its leads to some blank dimension <br>Of course! Remember when they were chilling inside the turtle? It didn't have a bathroom so they used Sticky Finger to pee in the Unexplainable Zipper Dimension. They asked themselves where the pee was REALLY going and Buccelati briefly implied that it might give some nutrition to the turtle. Weird shit.</br></br>  <br>Everyone in Part 6 that's not Pucci, Dio's bastard sons, or Weather Report took a backseat to the plot once they got out of prison.</br>  <br>Okay?</br>  Anime-only fag here<br><br>2 &gt; 3 [Egypt Arc] &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 &gt;&gt; 1<br><br>Can ANYTHING top Roundabout as an ending theme?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I honestly liked the fights from part 6 better than most of the part 5 fights.</br>  <br>Sure Close to the Edge as an opening theme.</br>  <br>Fuck off.<br>Gyro dies.</br></br>  <br>Even better, Jotaro dies.</br>  <br> 1 below 3 <br>Step up your game, son.<br><br>Jojo<br>1&gt;4&gt;5&gt;3&gt;2&gt;6<br><br>Brojo<br>5&gt;1&gt;3&gt;6&gt;4&gt;2<br><br>Stands<br>5&gt;4&gt;6&gt;3<br><br>Fights<br>5&gt;4&gt;6&gt;3&gt;2&gt;1<br><br>Villain<br>4&gt;3&gt;6&gt;5&gt;1&gt;2<br><br>Story<br>4&gt;2&gt;1&gt;6&gt;5&gt;3<br><br>Overall<br>4&gt;5&gt;1&gt;3&gt;2&gt;6<br><br>In the middle of SBR, so can't say about post MIH.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hierophant-green tier stand <br>Are saying HG wasn't strong?

Asuma could be more fleshed out <br>I think Boruto is a mix of Asuma and Konohamaru due their situation</br></br></br>  <br>It did have some kinda decent character designs and given the genre and especially the target audience some of the characters do have surprising depth/unused potential.</br>  <br> will be remembered fondly <br>This part is true.

Yeah, it will.</br></br>  <br>I will always remember fondly of the hall of anal devistation</br>  <br>What does that have to do with what he said.</br>  <br>at least he isnt crossdressing?</br>  <br> not liking crossdressing neji and Boruto <br>shit taste</br></br>  <br>Mods have been cracking down on other generals too.<br>Or they used to at least, I don't really keep up with that shit. Maybe they stopped.</br></br>  <br>hey i implied the sauce on there<br>Neji and Boruto on the other hand...</br></br>  <br> still visiting Arc-V general and seeing buyfag general <br><br>oh sorry, my bad<br>Sasuke crossdressing with one arm? no thanks</br></br></br></br>  <br>See you in 10 years when you need money for a new boat or whatever expensive thing is popular over there.</br>  <br>I don't think he ever got rich enough for a boat.</br>   Itachi Shinden will consist of two novels: The first being the Book of Bright Light (光明篇, Kōmyō-hen), which will be released on September 4, 2015. The second novel, the Book of Dark Night (暗夜篇, An'ya-hen), will be released in October 2015. <br><br> Itachi Uchiha, 4 years old. After he saw the battlefields from up close, he made a certain decision: I will change this world. &gt;The dream Itachi aimed at was to become the Uchiha Clan's first Hokage. Also, a future where his loved ones could live in peace. <br> His Ninja Academy era, meeting Shisui, from Genin to Chūnin and finally, Anbu.... <br> Itachi ran on the road of glory, not knowing about the cruel despair that awaits ahead.... <br> This is a story about the glory and failures as well as the determination of the shinobi hailed as a genius. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> and will be remembered fondly <br><br>Naruto was shit but I watched this shit since I was a kid so it's kinda memorable. But it doesn't change the fact that it has terrible writing, shit charachter and moral, not to mention stupid asspulls.</br></br></br>  <br>oh hey, more Itachi backstory<br>where is my Madara or Orochimaru novel?</br></br>   <br> The dream Itachi aimed at was to become the Uchiha Clan's first Hokage. <br><br>Kek. Don't worry itachi, salad will become the uchiha clan's first hokage. It's time for revolution.</br></br></br>  <br>Gee, Itachi! How come Kishi let's you have two novels?</br>  <br> And so is Naruto and One Piece <br>Naruto and One Piece are still massively popular though</br></br>  <br>So what? They are still shit.</br>  <br>Kishi is not part of these novels<br> studio pierrot is i think<br>The official 6 novels are the only ones canon</br></br></br>  <br>It's the publishing company that decides this shit. None of these novels are actually by Kishi except maybe the Boruto novel but I think that one has a different writer too.</br>  <br>Even thought Naruto without some visuals sounds incredibly retarded,, I really am looking forward to this<br><br>Itachi is my favorite character and I always wished he got more backstory before everyone started making him their toys</br></br></br>  <br>That timeline was made before all of the novels were announced</br>  <br> Actually liking Itachi sue. <br>To each their own I guess.</br></br>  <br> in b4 the novels are as depressing as D.gray-man novels </br>  <br>Where is this from?</br>  <br>where's tl anon when you need him</br>  <br> 4 Uchiha that ended up being some of the strongest ninjas in history aimed to become hokage at some point and couldn't. <br><br> a girl with a regular sharingan that needs glasses is going to end up getting the job eventually </br></br></br>  <br> more of Itachi Stu <br>Pass.</br></br>  <br> tfw all he wanted to do was have peaceful times with his otouto and Shisui </br>  <br> a girl with a regular sharingan that needs glasses is going to end up getting the job eventually <br> implying she didn't have some help getting there </br></br>  <br> He now can do ANYTHING <br> just draws yaoi manga under a pseudonym <br>   it's all incest. </br></br></br>  <br>Oh, the irony.</br>  <br>Jump would not allow it.</br>  <br><br>It was posted on NF first, then in the Naruto wiki and on tumblr, then on reddit and now here.</br></br>  <br>I'm more hype about "Jiraiya's" Icha Icha prototype novel</br>   Itachi <br> Mary Sue </br>  <br>not sp, sj</br>  <br>POTTERY</br>  <br>"This isn't narutos"</br>  <br>Are they doing a Boruto SD series? I'd read it.</br>  <br>It's a one-shot from Sasuke's SD series.</br>  <br>Springtime of Youth anime was pretty entertaining, I followed it every week</br>  <br>It's a oneshot in the Sauce series. I would like it if they gave him his own though, yes.</br>  <br><br> saw the battlefields from up close, <br> 4 years old <br> grew up no metal problems <br> He's a mass murderer, unambiguously seen as hero <br> Lifes he sacrificed seen as HIS sacrifice. I guess murder isn't murder if you feel really bad about that uchiha nursery. <br> everyone in-universe forgets Sasuke turning evil is squarely, absolutely, Itachi's fault. <br> the very first thing the first Hokage says without knowing him at all is that Itachi is probably better than him. <br> the third said he could have been hokage at seven. <br> Literally every single fight he is involved he always wins, always by introducing a whole new power never heard from before or since. Except that one time he both let Sasuke win while deathly ill. <br> Final fight devolves into an argument about what his sacrifice means. <br><br>Textbook mary sue.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Is anyone even translating Sasuke SD? I think I've only been able to find a chapter of it tranlated.<br><br>Agreed, Springtime of Youth was pretty funny. The characters work well in a more humor based setting.</br></br></br></br>  <br> the very first thing the first Hokage says without knowing him at all is that Itachi is probably better than him. <br>Are you fucking serious?</br></br>  Best family.  <br>  needs more sunflower <br> and aunt and grandpa </br></br>  <br> Hinata  <br> strong </br></br>  <br> needs more sunflower <br>There is, to this day, zero animated footage of Himawari. Either she's just that damn cute that they have to keep her a secret, or she's the most irrelevant character in the movie.<br><br>Hopefully it's the former. At least we know she has a few speaking lines, though.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Judging from the spoilers it appears to be the latter.</br>    <br>nah, chouchou is the more irrelevant character in the movie<br><br>himawari's birthday plays an important part and she has 4 scenes with her family</br></br></br>  <br>is this from the trailer? it's too precious</br>  <br>It must have been awesome growing up in the Uzumaki family before Naruto became hokage if the family pictures are anything to go by.</br>  <br>it's a blown up, perspective corrected part of a background shot from one of the teasers.</br>  <br>yes</br>    <br> and aunt and grandpa <br><br>I woulnd't expect to see any of them anymore. They don't even get a cameo during the chunnin exam and the only relative that gets name dropped is Minato.</br></br></br>  <br>They probably filled the stands with random nobodies instead of sneaking in every character that survived to the end of the series. What a waste.</br>  <br>I don't blame Boruto at all if it is true he doesn't want to be Hokage by the end of the movie.<br><br>Naruto has to both be the cities mayor and personally assign every ninja a mission. That's crazy.<br><br>Hell if Naruto can barely keep up with the workload, imagine anyone else. I'd even say the Hokage position should be split what with the population explosion.</br></br></br></br></br>  Didnt Kishi start a mafia manga like years ago when he first announced Nuruto is ending?   there are people who believe that Boruto will EVER become hokage <br> there are people who dont realize that Sarada will be hokage </br>  <br>don't forget that they are in the middle of the chunnin exams and there's a kaguya level thread</br>  <br>One shot.</br>  <br>Then why does he want to be an edgy traveling hobo that would end up spending even less time with his family?</br>  <br>  son, be careful about what you're saying <br>  the last time somebody (salad's mom) went off on that tangent, we got sucked into some alternate dimension <br>  I didn't realize it at the time, but I almost got teenage raped by an alternate version of your mom </br></br></br>  <br>He says no such thing. He says he'll be like sasuke in that he'll support Sarada as Hokage.<br><br>This kid got to witness best-dad overworked to the point that it strained their relationship. To the point of falling asleep in overtime like a Japanese businessman.<br><br>Fuck that noise. Good luck with that shit, Sarada. Let's see how many clones she can make.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> if i hadn't been a retard back them I would have let her </br>  <br>The End of the last had footage of her.</br>  <br>Second time. Although he may have actually been telling the filler girl to shut up because she was ranting in the previous scene.</br>  <br>"How does naruto fuck you hinata?  It's so I know how to fuck pinkshit really! "</br>  <br>Does this count?</br>  <br>There seems to be a pattern developing here.</br>  <br>poor sauce, it really is too easy to see him as a closet case who got friendzoned by his oblivious socially stunted teammate.</br>  <br>Technically, they've all saved the world.</br>  <br> implying he was serious when he said that </br>  <br>Not really, otherwise he would have said yes to this.</br>  <br>I don't blame him. Nobody told him about his dad's past, so he doesn't really know what he's saying.</br>  Any of the current subs for The Last good (i.e. not barely passable ones)?  <br>Even Orochimaru is sweating hilarious<br>Is it me? Or Hashirama acts like Goku and Tobirama like Vegeta</br></br>  <br> I don't blame Boruto at all if it is true he doesn't want to be Hokage by the end of the movie <br>He doesn't. He wants to support Salad  from behind. </br></br>  <br>Looks decent. Might check it out.</br>  <br>at this point naruto was already solidly paired off, so it wasn't like sauce would have had any reasonable sense of hope.<br><br>he's merely a weirdo obsessed with restarting his clan who's at best the most asexual character in the cast.</br></br></br>  Wasn't that Big tree cit in half because of Naruto's Lava Rasenchuriken?<br>Why it looks complete in the movie? <br>Did the bad guys fix it or what?</br></br>  <br>Salad pls<br><br> Everybody knows he want to fuck you in the ass while you wear the hat. </br></br></br>  <br> B-b-but he wanted to clean his HONOUUUURSSS <br>Fucker like Gayra wanted naruto's dick since he was the only person liking him even if he didn't interpret it right.</br></br>  <br>what's salad gonna do when she figures out that burrito has no interest in a hokage for a partner after having an absentee dad due to the position's rigors?</br>  <br> Madara/Mito interaction <br><br>Madara actually name dropped her once while Hashirama never did.</br></br></br>  After 400 years, do you know what I realized?  <br>sex makes babies</br>  that those glasses were meant for a woman?  your'e waifu a shit  Jet fuel can't transmute steel beams?  OP is a faggot<br>My taste&gt;your taste<br>you're waifu a shit</br></br>  <br>Those poor glasses look like they're getting horribly stretched out.</br>  Ignorance is bliss  <br>If you think about this statement, it actually makes no sense. Ignorance is bliss if you're taken care of. Otherwise, ignorance breeds pain like a hyperactive rabbit.</br>  <br>underrated meme</br>  <br>If you are treated like shit and your life is a hell, wouldn't it be better if you didn't know that's not the norm?. In fact, how do you know your life sucks if you don't know about a better life?</br>  My face is a square  <br>You were just like me, trying to make history.</br>  <br><br> Alchemy was a mistake </br></br>  Is this the face of a true hero?  <br>Pic related is the face of a true hero</br>  <br>face of a serious hero for a hobby<br><br>face of a serious hero</br></br></br>  <br>Licenseless Rider is confirmed GOAT.</br>  <br>Nah, that's just some ordinary hobbyist.<br><br><br>This nigga, though.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Even though saitama does it for a hobby doesn't mean he isn't a true hero. We all saw that he and licensless rider are the closest thinga to a true hero so far</br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree completely</br>  <br> Licensless rider <br> closest <br>that implies he isnt a true hero already anon</br></br></br>   oh boy a new chapter <br> 5 pages + a monet painting </br>  The face of a true hero has arrived.  <br> true hero <br> "I'm gonna fight even though I'm quite conscious about being weak as fuck and knowing that my struggle is ultimately pointless" <br>More like suicidal dipshit who seeks attention</br></br></br>  <br>anon, he fights no matter what because he wants to help the civilians, and at least help save the day even if it's just something like buying a few seconds for stronger heroes, Licensless rider is the truest of heroes</br>  <br>I see nothing heroic in suicide against overwhelming odds. Thats a really retarded cliche that only kids find truthful. Hero is first and foremost someone who puts needs of others before his own, and yes, sometimes it means sacrificing his life. But simply throwing your life away without achieving anything is plain psychotic.</br>  <br>thats the point, he knows how weak he is, but he doesnt want people to lose hope, he wants them to know someone is willing to die for them by charging towards a foe that in comparison is practically untouchable, to go against all odds, he's a light of hope.</br>  No, this is the face of a true hero. Nevar 4get.  <br>Squealer did nothing wrong.</br>  <br>Didn't he distract the sea king from genos, therefore saving his life? You know, just like Genos sacrificed himself to save that kid in the previous?</br>  alright where the FUCK do you get new murata chapters? they got taken off of batoto because of licensed anime bullshit.  Reminder that Garou did NUFFIN WRONG  Licenslees rider has been a hero for many years  <br>forgot image</br>  <br><br> mangafox </br></br>  <br>Hail Squealer.</br>  <br>as  said, it was taken off by Batoto, so I just searched for the chapter, mangafox was first up, I'll find a better site to read my manga, because manga fox is shit</br>  <br> I care about how other people read manga because I have autism. </br>  <br>One Punch Man had no business making me feel those feels.<br>Seriously.</br></br>  <br> people  <br> reading on mangafox <br>They subhumans at best and should be laughed at and shunned.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, Licensless rider is my 2nd favourite character<br>1) Saitama 2)Licensless rider 3) King/ Genos</br></br>  <br> willfully reading manga on low quality images <br>Sure, anyone can go ahead and be a shiteater, but don't post that shit here.</br></br>  <br>No, you're just a fucking pleb.</br>  <br>I'm the piece of shit that posted the mangafox image, read what I said <br>I'm using Kissmanga for OPM now</br></br>  <br> not Blizzard <br> not Sperm <br> not GARou <br> not Darkshine </br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know. But this is the face of a true villain.<br>Best villain monster so far</br></br>  <br>I was talking about heros, and yes I understand Blizzard, but Genos, King, Rider and Saitam all are better then her</br>  Is this the face of an ugly boy?  <br><br>What i liked about squealer is the fact that he was the character type that should have panicked and pleaded in that kangaroo court, but he did not he was brave, he was a hero.</br></br>  Yo Stinger and Lightning Max need their own gaiden.  Is this the face of a man who did nothing wrong?  <br><br><br>How does a gag manga have such good characters?</br></br></br>  <br>I dont know, It's definetely one of the best manga in recent times, because the amazing writing of the original + great art = top tier manga</br>  <br>I really hope all this hype for OPM means that Mob Psycho will get the same treatment. I like it better so far.</br>  <br>I havent read Mob Psycho yet</br>   2 months since the last ONE chapter   <br>It hurts</br>  The fuck are you all talking about.<br>Everything is right there on batoto, unless I'm missing some crucial part of information here.</br>  <br>DISASTER LEVEL<br><br>"GOD"<br><br> Garou vs Boros, who wins? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You say this, but if LR hadn't delayed the Sea King then all those civilians would have died.

To Licenseless Rider, buying even a few seconds is worth more than his life.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I suppose Boros would win, even if Garou is faster.</br>  <br>they're talking about the remake, which isnt there</br>    this is murata only right? I like it.  <br>http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/onepu<wbr>nch-man-r7139<br><br>??</br></br></wbr></br>  <br><br>Very weird, they definitely fucked up the tags on that or something, searching 'One Punch Man' doesn't bring it up when it used to, and searching 'Murata' doesn't work either.</br></br>  <br>searching for onepunch-man brings it up for me</br>  <br>Probably just a spelling issue regarding adding spaces.</br>  <br>what hero could win a fight against Boros?</br>  <br>No hero that we know of besides Saitama.</br>  <br>Saitama has literally defeated thousands of demon and dragon/god threats, and has gotten zero recognition for it.</br>  <br>lol no.</br>  <br>lol yes. Go reread the manga</br>  <br>Please tell me where it says he killed thousands of god-level threats, or even thousands of demon threats.</br>  <br>Maybe Tatsumaki and Bofoy because we doesn't know either the first's full strengh and the second's best weapons, but honestly that's unlikely.</br>  <br><br>  thousand <br><br>Yeah, no. Most of his biggest victories were given to King, and that wasn't any more than 6-7.</br></br></br></br>  Will Murata deliver tomorrow ? Will we have more than 10 pages ?  <br>He won't deliver, it will just be fillershit.</br>  WHEN WILL WE GET TO THE MONSTER ASSOCIATION ARC<br><br>WHEN MURATA WHEN</br></br>  <br>"yer talking shit 'bout me?"</br>   you will never be a cute and effeminate boy <br>why even live?</br>  <br> from the boku threads </br>  About to start opm for the first time.<br>I quickly skimmed the wikipedia page for it and it said there are multiple versions of the manga.<br>Is there a benefit to reading the original vs the remastered?</br></br>  <br>Go kill yourself with this fucking question again and again and again. Read the original then redrawn or make your own decision.</br>  <br><br>Especially on that cliffhanger, fuck.<br><br>Will he just give her a slap and it's over?<br>Will he bumm arround till she has destroyed the whole complex?<br>Will she become the next villian out of jealousy and despair?<br>Will everything just go smoothly?<br><br>Where's my chapter ONE?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Just read the remastered, then go to original since the re-mastered hasn't caught up yet. <br><br>That is, if you're OK with One's rubbish art (not to say that he can't convey things well with it).</br></br></br>  <br>dank as fuck</br>  <br>Spanking, since even if it will be drawn by ONE that means we can expect for it drawn by Murata one day.</br>  <br>Imagine if Tatsumaki won.</br>  <br>That's part of why ONE is popular, his art is crude but he can convey and compose really well.</br>  <br>That would go against everything up until now, but it would be an interesting twist. Kinda bullshit though, since Tatsumaki hasn't shown the level of power necessary to defeat Saitama. Will probably just be her getting pissy, Saitama being Saitama, and Fubuki stopping the fight before Tatsumaki can cause so much destruction.</br>  <br>The only good reason I can think of to make Tatsumaki beat Saitama is to make the readers butthurt, but that includes me so fuck that.</br>  <br>Nah. If Boros and God Garou can barely make him "serious", Tatsumaki isn't gonna do much. The fight will probably be more than a straight beat up if she ends up using her power to sent him far away or some shit like that.</br>   Drama CD with latest volume <br><br>I know I'm seriously starved for content, but I really want to know all I can about the voices for the anime.</br></br>  <br>He's courageous<br>He's selfless<br>I admire that<br>He's a hero</br></br></br></br>  <br>Stinger was actually strong as fuck thinking about it, he managed to take down nearly an entire army of Sea Monsters solo.</br>  <br>wasn't it supposed to be coming out at the start of August ?

Well, it could've been worse I guess.  <br>he said manga or anime<br><br> hurr hurr i'm roarshach from the watchmen <br><br>that's not how it works you tard</br></br></br></br></br>   Shimoneta <br>i'm getting fucked</br>  <br>Very.</br>   Eureka Seven <br>i am in ep 24,the suffering ends in some point r-right</br>  <br> kekkai sensen <br>send help</br></br>   Dandelion <br> surrounded by family of cute girls <br> have special power <br> money and status <br>I think I'd be okay.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just stop jacking off before it gets to that point, creep.</br>  <br> Time traveling doctor who fucks up history <br>Eh, not the worst person to be. But having cholera is.</br></br>  <br>Shokugeki no Soma for me too!<br>I guess it's not a total disaster. I enjoy cooking as a hobby but I'm nowhere near chef level so I'd probably get expelled on day 1. Also  I'm ten years older than the main cast </br></br>     Texhnolyze <br>I'm only on episode 3, but I think I could take losing an arm. I get that cooler arm, anyway. I've got this. I'll be alright if I don't fuck things up.</br>  <br> Love Hina <br><br>my dick is diamonds</br></br></br>  <br> genshiken <br>So nothing changes, huh?</br></br>  OH FUCK YES  Am I fucked?   I have become Darling <br>Try to not die and marry Miia like any sane man would?</br>  <br> Shimoneta <br><br>NOISE</br></br></br>   Charlotte <br>I don't know yet, but knowing Key there will be nothing but tears in the end.</br>  <br> Very </br>  <br> Texhnolyze <br>Anon...</br></br>  <br>If you're actually on episode three, you should reread your post after every three episodes or so. I can guarantee it'll be entertaining.</br>  <br> Texholyze <br>Topkek, if that was only it. <br><br>Oh damn anon, you're seriously FUCKED.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Aho Girl <br>I'd be a lot less fucked if I were actually fucked, but the only usable male isn't interested. With no marriage prospects and too stupid to get a job, I'll live with my disappointed mother for the rest of my life.  So I'm exactly as fucked as I already was. </br></br>  <br>why would you be</br>  I'm confused. Are you saying that we physically transform into the main character of the last anime we watched in the real world? Or are we transported into the world of the last anime we watched and assume the role of the main character? Or do we transform into the main character and stay in the world of the anime he/she is from?  <br>Hmmm... well, outside of being beaten and raped by strange female beings, ahm OK...</br>  <br>Well fuck. No seriously, one of the  first  things that would happen to me is that I'll literally get fucked. And I know this because you don't need your  future to be told to you  to know  you know  what to cause it. In fact I better warm-up a bit so then I can  dart out of situations quickly  if I happen to meet a  dead-end. </br>   Emma <br>If I'm Will, I marry Eleanor and live life as a classy noble with a bitchin' 16yo waf.<br>If I'm Emma then I kill myself because I'm weak and being lower class AND a woman in turn of the century England is fucking terrible.</br></br>   madoka magica <br>Sooo do I get to be a qt3.14 or does nothing happen?</br>  <br> Psycho Pass <br>Well, I get a JOB.</br></br>   hang around and do odd jobs with a cute girl and a pair of glasses <br>Sounds fun.</br>  <br> Netoraserare <br>I'm cucked</br></br>  <br>not really manga ... i was re-reading the part of eddard stark in winterfell... i'm Ned... FUCK IT!<br><br>if anime ... well i'm Kujo from Gosick ... going to die anyway ... i cant survive the 2ww , i'm too lame to survive!</br></br></br>  <br> If I'm Emma then I kill myself <br>You a shit<br>you get the chanche of being a cute girl and dress everyday with frills in victorian england and you throw it away like that? what a fucking faggot</br></br></br>  <br><br>Wait a second, does that mean I now have to play the euphonium, or I am now a euphonium-playing fluffy haired high-school girl?</br></br>  Awwww shiiiittttttt I'd be him in a heartbeat.  I guess Tomo-chan is no longer a girl. Bro end incoming.  <br>Hey this is alot less fun than it sounds, this means we have to go through hellish war and then have our friend from said war trying to destroy everything.<br><br>Also we have to eat otae's cooking</br></br></br>  <br>I am now a girl, a descendant of a red dragon, who is surrounded by strong, beautiful men willing to die to protect me.<br>We camp from one place to another living like nomads, and we fight battles upon battles for the good of the people, until I can finally figure out a way to reclaim my kingdom and dethrone the current king, my cousin and ex-crush who killed my father to take the throne.<br><br>I'll probably die from a bad infection, poisonous mushroom, or dysentery before I get anywhere.</br></br></br></br>   Clannad Rewatch <br>I guess Im ok</br>  please no I dont want to get hit  <br>I don't exist, because I don't watch anime or read manga. How'd I get here?</br>   Gene Starwind <br><br>I get a bitching spaceship and a brown catgirl?<br><br>Sweet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You like vegetables? If not I have some bad news for you.</br>   Working!! <br>I can spend time with Inami, so I'm good.</br>  Could be great  <br> Zetsuen no Tempest <br>So, my girlfriend's dead, but at least I had a girlfriend, so better to have loved than lost and stuff, and I've upgraded to an actually-good-tsundere magician princess now, anyway, so I'm glad my girlfriend died so I didn't have to get NTR'd. I'm doing pretty well for myself, honestly.</br></br>   I will be in an anime with survival games <br>This'll be fun, I guess.<br>Do I also have to go to an all-female high school though? That would end up pretty badly.</br></br>  <br>What part of 'you are the main character' do you not understand?</br>  My days of microwave dinners and lunchables are over!  <br>Not fucked at all.</br>  <br>I live in a harem, surrounded by gods who all love and worship me. gr8 m8</br>  <br>Not too bad, teach a scientist how to make babies and then get arrested. I'll take it.</br>  <br>We are same</br>  Is Hyouka still strong? <br><br>The love for one of the best anime of the last 5 years hasn't gone down, has it?</br></br>  <br>Of course not. Irisu still a shit, regardless.</br>   inb4 it's boring   I totally understand why people dislike Hyouka, but I still love it. It's just so damn relaxing and the characters are so lovable.<br><br> I also liked the mysteries </br></br>  <br>But it is<br><br>Just because you say water isn't wet doesn't mean it isn't.</br></br></br>  Definitely Kyoani's worst, and damn was there a lot of competition.  <br>i still like it.</br>  <br> mysteries <br>There was no mystery. Chitanda is just too retarded for her own good.</br></br>  <br>Just because you say you aren't a faggot, doesn't mean you are not.<br><br>Also, just because your mom said she didn't like it, doesn't mean that she didn't.</br></br></br>  <br>It's actually shit.</br>  <br>I don't. I honestly cannot understand why people dislike it. I understand it why people don't like it, but why they say it's bad, I honestly don't know.</br>   Waiting for something interesting to happen in Vol 5.   Chuunis and Tamako Market are still the worst crap Kyoani ever produced but Hyouka is in strong 3rd. I don't actually know how I managed to finish this snorefest, guess I was waiting for something exciting to happen but it just got worse with each episode.  <br>Lots of people watched it expecting a "serious" mystery show and instead they got a coming of age story with mysteries serving as little more than plot devices.<br><br>There is also the shitposters and the edgy contrarian brigade</br></br></br>  <br>I don't get it.</br>  <br>Not getting what you were expecting isn't a reason to hate something.</br>  <br>The mysteries were pretty damn good regardless of that.</br>  Mediocre but still one of the best Kyoani.  <br>Welcome to /a/</br>  Hyouka is probably the best thing KyoAni has ever done. S2 never.  <br>My heart, anon. ;___;</br>  <br> WHY WAS THERE NO AKSHUN IN A SOL FOCUSED ON CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, FUCKING SNOREFEST </br>  <br>I blame Yonezawa.</br>  Volume 9 ch 4 spoilers are in. <br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gazef<br><br>;_;<br><br>Holy army beating the fuck out of Lich scum when?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Gazef only hurt the goat,Aniz remains untouched </br>  <br>Shit, shit. Bad decisions all around. Shit.<br><br>RIP  Gazef , you were too good for the world Ainz is about to make his.</br></br></br>  <br>I blame Climb for this</br>  <br>Welp, can't say it was much of an heroic battle.</br>  Ahahahaha this show<br> Rui almost kill <br> Hajime slowly going crazy <br> VAPE leader seems still has something up his sleeve <br> Alien KanaHana/Sugita 'uniting' people <br> Tsubasa being stupid <br> 2:6:2 <br><br>I don't remember season 1 being this fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw you never noticed Paipai's suit had an actual head </br>  <br>The fuck are you on about, her suit is basically all hea-oooooooh my god.</br>      why is utsutsu always utsutsu?    <br><br>Because of Fighto Daiyo, being a weird combination between raw talent but sometimes misplaced focus and having a well rounded character design that's a combination of physically fit and beautiful. I'd call her beauty in vain after he MC from Chihayafuru. <br><br>Really though it's the whole Fighto Daiyo and raw courage and passion that kind of makes her though as she's sort of the embodiment of the whole muse ideal. Fists clenched, Fire I her eyes like she belongs in a different genre almost.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The first single of Aqours will be BD release, and it will indeed include a PV.</br>  <br><br>Actually that is true now that I think about it. No TV anime series has ever done better in that format.</br></br>  Is µ's still going to keep on going? In real life, I mean.  I know it's gone as of the movie in the animeverse.   <br> anon doesn't like LL <br>how does someone do that?</br></br></blockquote>]
