Shit streaming and everything else<br><br>Jew hole</br></br></br></br>  <br>It is shit</br>  <br>it used to be my main way to watch anime up until 6 months ago, now i only use it whenever i feel like watching anime in bed :3</br>  I want to protect that blush.  <br><br>Who is this cute boy?</br></br>  Is Riu just stupid or a literal retard?  <br>Once he's a literal  corpse  next episode, that won't matter anymore.</br>  <br>But he did the right thing.</br>  <br>No. He was just super optimistic and naive.</br>  <br>Well, it was either that or giving VAPE the pretext to actually start killing people.</br>  <br>And now he has shown them that they can basically demand everything. Who stops them from taking hostages again and demand the other notes?</br>  <br>When you think about it, it reinforced people's disdain and hate for VAPE, making the red-haired guy's plan less likely to succeed.</br>  <br>No? He was portrayed as the good guy. Even if he dies (and he won't die), he'll go as a well beloved martyr and vape will be the bad guy.<br><br>Didn't you see the obvious OPINION-SHIFT on the people which were all turned against Vape? Rui's nobility touched them.</br></br></br>  <br>Exactly. Whatever Rizumu does now, he'll lose. Rui put him in a no win situation.<br><br>People will no longer support him and he comes across as weak willed psycho who breaks his ideals while Rui comes across as too pure for this sinful world who is strong in his ideals. <br><br>He's just cornered and made himself everyone's hateful enemy not to mention he assaulted someone LIVE. He can be arrested with evidence now.</br></br></br></br></br>  Too bad he is about to be burnt to a crisp by Tsubasa  <br><br>I just finished the first season of this and it was very good, how is the second fairing up so far?</br></br>  This anime is why you should kill anyone that vapes.  <br>It hasn't really gone anywhere yet, Hajime gets some unusual focus cuts to imply that maybe something is wrong with her and the new Gatchaman is a qt hothead.<br><br>It's fun though, new OP is great.</br></br></br>  <br>This. There's a reason hostage negotiations include having snipers ready to take out the hostage taker.</br>  Do you think Joe was 100% right?  <br>Joe is always right</br>  <br>Why didn't Joe die in the first season?</br>  <br>He got his note tore off, but Katze didn't stab it.</br>  <br>Will he die this season at least?</br>  <br> joe <br> The guy who is always proved wrong <br><br>Anon... when the antagonist and joe make a point, expect it be the opposite.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Crowds is about RuiRui suffering, not Joe. Joe gets the happy ending.</br>  <br>Because female audience would drop it.</br>  <br>Joe is my least favorite character and the show would improve for me if he died  I'm a grill btw </br>  <br>Joe needs more Bird Missiles for a happy ending.</br>  <br>OP has amazing visuals.<br>ED is not as good as the previous one but passable.<br>First episode was a good first episode. <br>Second was more exposition heavy.<br>And now we got to the Rui suffering in half the time of the previous season!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't matter, Joe is always right. If Joe saids the sky is green then the sky is green.</br>  <br>i hope he die</br>  <br>This, Rui is pretty much series' messianic figure, of course he'll be proven right in the end, Joe is just some capefag wannabe.</br>  <br>If he does die it would probably be near the end because he is one of the more popular characters (according to pixiv anyways). Maybe he is still depressed deep down but not enough to be suicidal. Joe is the only male eye candy so the female audience might go down. Carrot doesn't count because he is a cunt and Rui is eye candy for both genders.</br>  So who sponsored all the tablets they were giving for free to everyone?  <br>Except he's not entirely right.</br>  <br>That reminds me of some experiments in social psychology.</br>  <br>As much as I hate carrot, he does have a point. There are good people and there are shit people. Something Rui doesn't seem to understand. Joe doesn't really want to be a messiah. He just wants to protect people. He doesn't seem to like much attention. Out of all the gatchas he is the one that appears less in public. Joe understands that there is evil people out there. I don't know how the show is going to prove Rui right.</br>  <br>Well you have to use the public funds for SOMETHING</br>  <br>It's the power of being attractive</br>  <br>Rui is naive in his idealism but carrot does not have a point. Crowds are a tool just like any other. A bad person can take a knife and go stabbing spree, a bad person can take a car and drive it into a crowd, that's not a reason to ban knives or cars. <br>There is always a risk, it's simply a matter of pros outweighing the cons.</br></br>  <br>Me too. I hate cross dressers like him.</br>  <br>You won't be able to anon. We all know what route Tsubasa will go.</br>  <br> his accuracy with the darts matches how accurate his words are <br>DEEP</br></br>  <br>The show already proved Rui right last season, when him giving out the crowds to everyone didn't turn into a massive bloody clusterfuck. You can either love or hate how optimist the show's worldview is, but it's part of the suspension of disbelief. Hajime has that worldview too (the boys who won't give up their seat on the bus are probably tired, the wife of the man who was speeding with his car had just gone into labour) and she is always shown to be in the right.<br><br>Anyway, Rui has clearly looked up Rizumu and deduced he couldn't have been that bad (in fact, if he really were evil he would have gone along with Katze's plan as soon as he had his chance), so it's not even about Rui naively believing that there are no evil people.<br><br><br>Yeah, I'm not sure. What other motivation could they have?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Senran Kagura is the best Gatchaman.  So did Rizumu not have the balls to use his Crowds right away, or was he just not interested until Rui's idealism rubbed him the wrong way?  <br>Maybe he was busy studying. <br>I'm pretty sure he is a decent person who snapped, possibly after losing someone to the incident in Tachikawa. (How long have the red crowds been active, anyway?)</br></br>  <br>I don't get it that's what I said. I mean Rui believes everyone is good deep down in their hearts which is not true.</br>  <br><br><br>Rui and Hajime are supposed to be advanced human beings more enlightened than you. That's the basis of their concept. <br><br>Rizumu destroyed his credibility to have a point when Katze cheered up for him and became a knife-wielding psycho.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Rui is said to be the character who reflects the future of humanity. That's why villains are always attacking him or try to corrupt him. His resolution and his pain are important for the outcome of all. First season, it was about Katze and Hajime tug-fight for Rui, this one Rizumu and maybe Tsubasa join the fold for it.<br><br>He's like the mecha pacifist princess, only male.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Joe can do no wrong.</br>  <br>Alcoholizing Sugane was pretty wrong. Remmeber when Sugane was an earnest diligent boy. Now he's a drunkard.</br>  <br> mecha pacifist princess <br>All he is missing is a song, but I think the White Ash lead singer's got that covered.</br></br>    <br>Why is Utsu-tsu the most underrated girl on the show?</br>  <br>Hajime is way more of a senran.</br>  <br>Word<br><br><br>It's good because Sugane enjoyed it. Joe can't do no wrong. Sugane knows Joe is best boy.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Tsubasa will fuck Rui. <br><br>Hotblooded hero mc gets peace princess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish, but<br> Crowds <br> romantic development <br>Choose one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't have enough dick to please Rui.</br>  <br>She's more manly than anyone in the cast. Even Paiman is girlier.</br>  <br>Because if they tried that shit again, then it's no longer the Gatchaman's fault for any other deaths that occurred. No one will be sympathetic to their cause anymore once they broken their trust. Now it's up to Vape to prove they can honor any other agreements from that point on. And until then, it would be no quarters from everyone else.</br>  <br>Hotblooded hero mc who fucks up the peace princess Honorable Sacrifice doesn't deserve shit. <br><br>Anyway Sugane and Joe saved Rui first, Tsubasa needs to respect seniority.</br></br></br>  <br>No, not really. The moment Tsubasa intervene, he won. Now he can say he meant every word he said, but because the Gatchaman tried to attack him during negotiations, they are the ones that broken the agreement. They are the ones that can no longer be trusted. Any further deaths will be on their heads now.</br>  <br>Hajime needs a tragic backstory to be a Senran</br>  <br> No one will be sympathetic to their cause anymore once they broken their trust. <br><br>But Gelsadra absorbed everyone insight and they were against Vape.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sugane and Joe have each others.</br></br>  <br><br> Rui and Hajime are supposed to be advanced human beings more enlightened than you <br> Rui is said to be the character who reflects the future of humanity <br>Where was this said?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sugane feels the need to apologize for everything he does <br> Joe turned him into an alcoholic <br><br>Nice and healthy.</br></br></br></br>   mfw Rizumin and Tsubasa have reversed eye/hair colors   <br>That's because no one has died yet and they haven't learn what the full details of the discussion. If someone had died and Rui could have prevented it, it will cause massive backlash. They all saw Rui willingly give away his Note, that means he accepted whatever deal VAPE has proposed. Now that the agreement has been ruined by Gel and Tsubasa's intervention, they now share part of the responsibility for any other deaths.</br>    <br>Fuck, it's true.</br>    <br> the Gatchaman tried to attack him during negotiations <br><br>I doubt stabbing somebody to death is "negotiating"</br></br></br>  <br>You should have found the back of Sugane's head for good measure.</br>    <br>Being manly != having a dick</br>  <br>Rui willingly gave him the Note and told the others to stay away. Rizumin's plan probably required someone to come and stop him since he knows if he actually stabbed Rui to death through the Note, it would only make him into a martyr and spurn the populace into fully adopting Crowds. Rui and Hajime probably knows this and didn't interfere because they know Rizumin can't follow through with it for the reasons above.<br><br>By having someone come and intervene, no matter how it looked, they now share responsibility in any eventual deaths as well as prove that just because Rui believed in him, doesn't mean other people will. The same applies to the Crowds system. There has to be trust between everyone for it to function properly.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, if Rui could call lying in a pool of his own blood a "fight"...</br>  More Rui suffering next week?  <br>Maybe next time he should communicate his plan with the rest of the team.</br>  <br>It's not like there was much time. The rest of the team should trust him to make the right decision and respect his wishes.</br>  <br>From Tsubasas perspective it did look like he was dying for nothing.</br>  <br>Tsubaka.</br>  <br>Never discuss about Symphogear and Gatachaman at the same time.</br>  <br>Utsubasa.</br>  <br>When OD, Hajime and Rui all say not to interfere, it's a good sign that you shouldn't interfere. But I think that's the point they're trying to make. Both Hajime and Tsubasa has a tendency to rush into things, but one does it based on logic and reasoning while the other based on instinct and emotions. It's a nice contrast between the ideology between the two heroines, while providing a parallel to Rui and Rizumin. There's no right or wrong ways, just different ways of doing things.</br>  <br>O.D. had *just* finished explaining everything to her.</br>  <br> There's no right or wrong ways <br>I get what you are saying, but even if you act on emotions and instinct alone you still need to respect other people wishes. Especially if it's your first day on the job!</br></br>  <br>Will Rui´s elephant say "Tuskete"?</br>  <br>And ultimately, she was prepared to accept the responsibility of defying other people's wishes. OD told her as such and she accepted. She couldn't stand suffering, even if it's the logical thing to do. Kinda like the sacrifice one to save many mentality. Logically, it is a good trade-off, but she just can't accept such a sacrifice and willing to bear the burden of saving that one life.</br>  <br> There's no right or wrong ways, <br><br>But in the end Rui's way will be the 'right way'</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, in the end, it will be a compromise. Rizumin will become co-admin of the Crowds system or something.</br>  <br>Probably but next episode they are going to portray her way as bad.</br>  <br>Doubtful. It's a bit too early for that. They'll probably raise Tsubasa and Gel on a pedestal for a while for saving Rui's life and ask why the other Gatchaman didn't help. Build both of them up as the true saviors before having them come crashing down and causing Gel to turn evil in the process. Then understanding and hand-holding happens, and suddenly everyone fights as a team and an understanding ending occurs. Oh, and Katz probably goes crazy at one point because someone had hurt Hajime.</br>  <br>Why would Katze go crazy about someone hurting Hajime?</br>  <br>Because it's clear that he likes her. He's a massive tsundere when it comes to her. No amount of his bullshit works on her, she saw him in his real self and still accepted him. It's true love.</br>  Next episode is called 2-6-2, so we'll probably hear more of Rizumu's ideas.<br><br><br>Agreed. It works with the presenter saying he liked the two of them and with the titles of the episode being marketing terms (or so I've heard?)</br></br></br>  <br>2:6:2 is what, a bell curve?</br>  <br><br>I think so. First time I've heard the term.</br></br>   2-6-2 <br> Under the Whyte notation system, a steam locomotive that has two leading wheels, six coupled driving wheels, and two trailing wheels. <br>Wait what? Probably not it.</br></br>  <br>The thought of Katze being protective of Hajime instead of delighting in her suffering and the world burning around her is dishearteningly boring.</br>  <br>They're essentially the same person though. No one will be able to understand them more than each other. He might want her to adopt his viewpoints, but losing what amounts to his soulmate? Never.</br>    <br>I can't tell if you're a retarded troll or a just a retard.</br>  Is Rui transgender or just a crossdresser?  <br>Just a crossdresser.</br>  <br>Hajime called him a boy and he didn't correct her.</br>  <br> Who stops them from taking hostages again and demand the other notes? <br>Hajime.</br></br>  <br><br>Creators confirm he's just a crossdresser. I think OD's gender is unconfirmed though.</br></br>  <br> O.D was born and raised on a distant planet between a native and an Earth human. O.D gained their NOTE through some unknown event. One day, Berg Katse appeared and had the people of O.D's planet turn on each other. O.D found Katse and fought him in their Gatchaman form and while they managed to damage Katse, they ended up destroying his home planet. Katse had thought that O.D was dead when they really just went to Earth.  <br><br>I guess I really should finish S1</br></br></br>  <br><br>I always thought OD was just a gayy lmao.</br></br>  <br> &gt;O.D was born and raised on a distant planet between a native and an Earth human. <br>So there's other humans in space? What the fuck?</br></br>  <br>Maybe it was a Gatchaman who traveled.</br>  <br> There's no right or wrong ways, just different ways of doing things. <br>What you say is correct but it doesn't mean you're right.</br></br>  <br> red crowds and blue crowds? I don't care, I just want to protect everyone even if that doesn't answer your question! <br> he's fighting for his principles? I don't care, I just want to protect everyone even if it makes his sacrifice completely pointless! <br><br>Truly the worst Gatcha. Does that everyone she wants to protect include Rizumin? Because if it doesn't she's just a hypocrite full of shit that only wants to save people she handpicks. That's not really everyone.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Truly the worst Gatcha <br>Joe is a faggot but at least he has a reason to exist. Utsutsu could be straight-up removed from the series and nothing would change.</br></br>  <br> Joe is a faggot but at least he has a reason to exist. <br>What reason? Make Sugane an alcoholic?<br><br> Utsutsu could be straight-up removed from the series and nothing would change. <br>Sure. There wouldn't even be a S2 because everyone would be dead.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Utsutsu is OD's daughteru. He needs her.</br>  <br>"Utsuutsu shimasu" is an extremely important line, you know.</br>  <br> Utsutsu could be straight-up removed from the series and nothing would change. <br>True, but that would be a terrible decision. Plus, Hajime got some cool dialogue from scenes with her.</br></br>  <br><br>Also be sure to watch the ep0.<br>Looks like they had to fit (again) 15 minutes or so of extra content outside the 12 eps to make things clear.<br>At leat they did it in advance this time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I still have no clue about how that single line gets subbed with tons of different meanings depending on what people are talking about.</br>  <br> What reason? Make Sugane an alcoholic? <br>Sugane's character in general (including making him an alcoholic), and getting beat up like a bitch by Katze.<br><br> Sure. There wouldn't even be a S2 because everyone would be dead. <br>I can't actually remember any time she healed another Gatchaman. The only scene I remember of her using her healing powers for some practical purpose was the one in the tunnel from S1.<br><br><br><br><br>I don't really hate her either, she's cute, but she's also by far the most useless character. It's like she exists only because they really wanted a loli in a swimsuit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Last time it was because they didn't have it ready on time, not because they ran out of time.</br>  <br>She healed O.D and Joe and is pretty obvious she's the one healing others in the background. She'll probably save Rui from certain death too. If you think Joe is useful for Sugane's development I don't understand why you can't see Utsutsu was good for other character's to see Hajime's influence, like O.D or Joe. Joe was motivated by Utsutsu wanting to help others with her life in the tunnel.</br>  <br>She exists to show how Hajime changed everyone and also to, you know, heal Joe, Sugane and eventually Rui after they were beat up by Katze? That tiny little turning point of the season.</br>  <br> because they didn't have it ready on time, not because they ran out of time <br>Those are the same thing.</br></br>  <br>Not really. Running out of time means 12 episodes weren't enough, they needed more. Not having the episode ready on time means they could have done it in 12 episodes, but they didn't have the episode ready when it was due so they filled half of it with a recap. If they came up with episode 00 that suggests 12 episodes weren't enough for Insight.</br>  <br>Correct me if i'm wrong, but wasn't ep12 of S1 a regular 20-ish minutes one? <br>Because then either they planned to get a longer slot and didn't get it/have the content ready on time or they actually underestimated the runtime of the plot they planned.</br></br>  So is this episode the reason Rui's shadow is X? I don't expect him to die, but maybe he'll become more integrated with X?  <br><br>The impact Hajime had on her was far smaller than on most other characters, and I don't think Joe was really motivated as much as just empathetic towards her. I guess healing people in the background is a legit feat though, a bit plot device-y but definitely important.</br></br>  They ran out of time for the animators to actually animate. Tatsunoko Pro has really shit schedules. Did you guys miss half of the animation for the Yatterman Night finale being missing and the animators apologizing on Twitter and telling people to wait for BD?  <br>Geez Hajime, how does your director allow you to have two frames in the opening?</br>  <br>It was regular length. They didn't have ep 11 done in time, so they added a recap for half of it. This pushed half of 11 into 12, so there had to be a director's cut so we could see what was supposed to be in 12.</br>  <br>OD seriously puts my straightness to the test.</br>  <br>MmmmmMMmmmmm it's almost like she is not alone in there</br>  <br>The other anon explained it all. In order for episode 12 not to be cut off completely they tried to fit in as much as possible by cutting bits here and there but it was worse that way in my opinion. Everything was confusing and some of the international releases don't even come with the director's cut so there's people who never watched it. It would have been better to try to get another timeslot for it later on or release an OVA and end episode 12 with a cliffhanger.</br>  I want to leave it to Sadra  <br> Did you guys miss half of the animation for the Yatterman Night finale being missing and the animators apologizing on Twitter and telling people to wait for BD? <br>No, but that didn't have any holes in the plot that will need extra content, it's just that they didn't make in time with all the needed cuts and had to work out with what was avaible.<br><br>It's kind of strange to think the same Tatsunoko delivered a nearly flawless YZQ just few months after Crowds S1 and a year before Yatterman.<br> Tablets magic <br><br><br><br>I see, i completely forgot about the recap in ep 11.<br> It would have been better to try to get another timeslot for it later on <br>Just as Kekkai Sensen then.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I actually really like Tsubasa.<br>Am I the only one?</br></br>    <br>Hell no you aren't. Where'd you get that idea.</br>  <br>She needs to get a bit of her shonen protagonist hotheadness sorted out, but otherwise she's alright.</br>  <br>Unconfirmed-gender aliens are fair game. I'd do it.</br>  <br> Joe  <br> not looking at Sugane like he just spiked his drink <br>The style reminds me of Kinako but there's just no way.</br></br></br>  <br> Rui and Hajime are supposed to be advanced human beings more enlightened than you <br><br>Does this have something to do with Rui being Gatcha 100 and Hajime Gatcha 101?<br><br>Maybe anybody after 100s is suppose to be a new kind of human.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hajime gives Rizumu her Note with Katze inside and then Katze drives him insane by his endless shtitpost. It's a perfect plan.</br>  <br>is this some kind of new BD cover?</br>    <br>Where'd you get it?</br>  <br><br>Found it: it's from kinako's twitter : https://twitter.com/kamabokoita<br><br> Guy that I was thinking the cover of the old wants Design Works Once old folder watching  <br><br>I think it's one of the first sketches for the Design Works cover</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>OD is confirmed as non male by the director. When he's asked what sleepwear and what underwear do his male characters wear, he mentions Rui's and Katze's (with Sugane's and Joe) but omits OD.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, her ero Twitter is locked. What a shame. I wonder if she has porn Gatcha art there.</br>  <br>Interviews.<br><br>When first season started, Rui and Hajime were called "new human beings" that heralded the future.<br><br>Before season, they explained Rui's symbolic role and why Katze and Hajime basically fought over his heart. When he chose to believe in himself, the plot solved itself.<br><br>Right now, Rui's not believing in himself, despite his actions, because he got troubled and isolated from the Gatcha and there's a new antagonist who is unsurprisingly predatory on him. They'll always be predatory on Rui because he's the one who holds the key to the future.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Guy that I was thinking the cover of the old wants Design Works Once old folder watching  <br>My sides.<br><br>"I get nostalgic when I look at old folders. I was thinking about the Design Works's cover at the time"</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you anon.</br>  <br>I always thought they were so predatory on Rui because he looked like such a perfect rapebait fuccboi that even straight males don't care.</br>  <br>...Close enough.<br><br>Thank you!</br></br></br>  <br>What sleepwear DO the guys wear?</br>    <br>Utsutsu had an arc in the first season, she's also OD's daughteru, and has lesbian love with Hajime and potential straight love with Rui.<br><br>I'll be mad this Tsubasa bitch replaced her.</br></br></br>  <br> those hips <br><br>How can a boy have those hips?</br></br></br>  <br>That's purposeful. Rui was female originally. He's always been the show heroine among the heroes.</br>  <br>The song that plays when Rui's alone and Katze is creepy on him is a song of a leopard stalking his prey. No shit.</br>  <br>They are predatory because Rui's role is of main heroine. They just changed his gender.</br>  <br>My moonreading abilities are still green but if it helps, I couldn't ask for more.</br>  <br>I can't believe OD ditched based Baracchi for that green fat faggot.</br>  Friendly reminder that green faggot will have part of the blame for Gelsadra taking over humanity.    <br/>  Tsubasa is right  <br>This is "Why couldn't you protect this smile" in gif form.</br>  <br>The eye twitches are so good.</br>  <br> blood not changed to white color <br>Why did I even expect anything good?</br></br>  <br>This scene deserves a webm, not a gif.</br>  <br>I'm sure OD knows the dude is a cunt, he's just there for show.</br>  <br>Hes such a bad trap you can always tell its a boy no mater how many tricks he uses. <br><br>But doesn't that oddly also make hing a far better trap?</br></br></br>  <br>Anon i would do it if the scene didn't make me feel so uneasy... Actually i'm surprised nobody has done a proper webm already.</br>  <br>The fact that they had released pic related as a promo picture a few days earlier made everything that much sweeter.</br>  <br> No matter how many tricks <br><br>He's actually not using many. One of the first rules of trapping is hide your manshoulders and he always has them out.

Tsubasa and Gel-chan will explode in popularity and MIRIONE SHOE will capitalize on it. Tsubasa and Gel-chan will be everywhere and people will begin relying on Gel-chan more and more. The VAPE conflict will be escalating at the same time and it will become more violent.

I'm interested in reading those or anything about the earlier concept.</br>  <br>Tell me about Rui, why does he wear the wig?</br>  So do they refer to Gel Sadra as -kun out of respect, because she's some genderless alien like OD, or because she's a trap?  <br>1 or 2. She's not a trap.</br>  <br>Option 1 or 2, but 3 is okay if you want to shitpost and get people riled up.</br>  <br> 2:6:2 <br>Apparently it also refers to something in locomotives called a prairie.</br></br>  <br>Q: Please tell us what are the G Members’ best swimsuits!<br><br>A:<br><br>Hajime: A colourful and cute swimsuit with frills.<br><br>Sugane: The school designated racing swimsuit.<br><br>Joe: Surfer pants.<br><br>Utsutsu: The bikini she normally wears.<br><br>O.D: High leg boomerang swimsuit.<br><br>Rui: Pleated bikini.<br><br>Paiman: Can’t swim and thus has no swimsuit.<br><br>————————-<br><br>Q: Please tell us what the male characters’ nightwear and underwear are!<br><br>A: I’ve received confirmation from Director Nakamura.<br><br>Sugane: Nightwear is a t-shirt and sport short pants, underwear is low-rise sports briefs.<br><br>Joe: Has no nightwear so he either sleeps as he is or in the nude, underwear is branded high class low-rise briefs.<br><br>Rui: Nightwear is high class yoga wear, underwear is cute briefs.<br><br>Katze: Has no nightwear because he doesn’t sleep, doesn’t wear any underwear.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> underwear is cute briefs. </br>  <br> Joe: Has no nightwear so he either sleeps as he is or in the nude <br>Lewd</br></br>  <br> Katze: doesn’t wear any underwear <br>Slag.</br></br>  <br> Utsutsu: The bikini she normally wears. <br><br>Is Utsutsu a poorfag?</br></br></br>  <br>She probably wouldn't even have that if it wasn't for Earth's social norms.</br>  What if Kaworu met Asuka instead of Shinji? Could he have healed her wounds?  I don't think he's into girls.  <br>Probably bisexual actually.</br>  <br><br>I don't really have anything to say about this kaworu/asuka shipping business, but I will say this: I can't imagine Kaworu honestly giving a damn about someone's sex. The bond between himself and Shinji didn't really seem all that based on physicality, and it's pretty easy to think that an existence like Kaworu's is sort of elevated above that.</br></br>  <br>He's literally a mini albino Kaji.<br>He's probably the only one who could make her truly happy.</br></br>  No, because he's an angel. Imagine what she'd do if she was betrayed like that.  <br>She'd probably kill herself.</br>  <br>Considering she already tried once by the time Kaworu shows up, yeah probably. Could you imagine if she had to do what Shinji did to Kaworu if, like, she was in an actual relationship with Kaworu? It would cement the fact that anything that loves her dies in her head, completely destroying any hope left. <br><br>This thread made me sad fuck you OP</br></br></br>  <br>Jesus fuck. I just realized she'd be like 50 times more clingy to Kaworu then Shinji ever was.</br>  <br> She'll never be clingy to you <br> You can never make her feel safe and loved <br> Once her life turned to shit she never got even a moment of relief. </br></br></br>  <br>Wait that's not true there was like 10 seconds when she found out her Mama was in the Eva but then she got eaten alive by giant bird monsters while the boy she loved listened unable or unwilling to save her</br>  <br> while the boy she loved <br>I thought Kaji died way before then</br></br>  <br>She loved Shinji she just doesn't know how to love properly. It wasn't shipping, it was toxic love, unfulfilled and septic.<br><br>Kaji was more of a daddy thing because her cunt father didn't give a shit.</br></br></br>  <br>I absolutely love crack pairing characters but Kaworu and Asuka wouldn't look good together, I'm sorry.</br>  <br><br>Kaworu strangles kittens for fun. That's a big turn-off for girls.</br></br>  <br>Anything that makes my girl happy. Even   Shinji  </br>  <br>Not Asuka she's got some pretty fucked up fetishes (she's part German) You should see her search history. She can only have an orgasm if something innocent dies</br>  <br>Do you really think Asuka would be blushy and moe like Shinji? If Kaworu had met Asuka first, he would have decided to nuke all the Lilim and be done with it.</br>  Was he gay?  Asuka's love starved and she's forward. If Kaworu told her he loved her, she'll raped him in the bath to validate herself. She wouldn't kill him either, I can't see her doing that. She'll just make a bitter speech about puppets.   kaworufags haven't killed themselves yet <br><br><br>He's dead.</br></br></br>  <br>Her hair is nice.</br>  <br><br>Holy shit look at their eyes. They look like took a bunch of MDMA and are outside cuddling and just sort of ... looking at shit. <br><br>It's fun for awhile but goddamn I'd hate to see their comedown.</br></br></br></br>   kawoshitters so buttblasted they are trying to ship him with Asuka to recover <br>Yeah, nah.</br>  <br>Just call them fat and they'll start cutting</br>  <br>She'd act with him as she does with Kaji.</br>  <br>I want to brush it with her hairbrush. Because we all know what she does with that thing.</br>  This thread reeks of landwhales tbh  <br>They are feeling triggered</br>  <br> tbh <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/</br></br>  <br>This isn't /hoc/</br>  <br><br>You just mad that if we met in real life, you'd still be the one begging for sex and I'd be the one turning you down.</br></br>  <br>She looks so happy<br>;_;</br></br>  <br>Why do they live in what appears to be a submarine?</br>  <br>What Asuka needs is a real man, supported by deleted scenes. She doesn't need a fruitcake</br>  <br>SEELE are Jews who don't give Kaworu a big enough allowance.</br>  <br>Her reaction images are so cute.<br><br>Also, those trips.</br></br></br>  <br> stealing her best friend's crush <br>I'd feel bad for Hikari</br></br>  <br>Tell you what best of all worlds. All five pilots + Hikari join a giant fuckteam. Every single one of them is in a relationship with every other member of the fuck team. They can all fuck together or separately.</br>  Kaworu isn't into boys or girls, he isn't into sex because he isn't thinking like human.<br><br>He took interest in Shinji because how lost he was and for some reason he wanted to guide him.<br><br>He on every occassion sees right through Asuka with her mental problems.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want Asuka to play with me like that.</br>  <br>Because a metaphysical pseudo-god that can know you through your ego and is more concerned about who you are than what you are would care, right?</br>  <br> Not having all 6 pilots-Hikari <br><br>Hikari a shit and if Toji wasn't crippled he'd be tapping dem Ayanami thighs or having hatesex with Asuka</br></br></br>  <br>She didn't come out Gendo's cock and so he doesn't care about her. He probably would've helped her kill herself with a pleasant smile.</br>  <br> this fujoshi was so assmangled they absolutely felt the need to make this thread <br>Do your fucking jobs mods, you deleted the other thread now get this trash out of here.</br></br>  <br>You're literally a disgusting slagplanet, get the fuck off /a/</br>    <br>Hilariously enough there's an official guidebook for NGE2 stating outright that Kaworu isn't into women, much less anyone who isn't Shinji<br>It's not as canon as the series but Anno did have a say in it</br></br>  <br> Toji <br>Someone remembers he exists! He's a much better match for Asuka than Kaworu.</br></br>  <br> Kaworu hamplanets </br>  <br>You are a landwhale tbh</br>  <br>He'd be good for both Rei and Asuka. Rei because he's sociable and Asuka because he won't take none of her shit.</br>  <br><br>I wonder if he has a suitable scent for Mari to take an interest.</br></br>  <br>Crackshippers in general should just be rounded up and killed.</br>  <br>Probably</br>  <br>Who is that? Can't seem to remember her from the series.</br>  <br>That's because she isn't in the series.</br>  <br>She's Mana Kirishima from Neon Genesis Evangelion Second Impression.</br>  Does Asuka x Misato exist as a crackship?  It has 24 episodes. Start watching faggots.  <br>no thanks</br>  Watched it ages ago, don't remeber shit except for the indirect kissing slut.  <br>in b4 she smells a boy and proceeds to make out with him</br>  What is this thread? Are you under the assumption that Star Driver is an obscure anime on /a/? I can see why you might think that if most people here are as new as you are, which is unfortunately a possibility.  <br>You are one funny nigger anon. I am under the assumption that Star Driver is underrated so you should watch it faggot.</br>  Already watched. Already know who best girl is.  Does the anime have cute girls in it? And what is it about? I don't like watching old shitty animations.  <br>Green right?</br>  <br>I bet your first anime was winx club</br>  I thought I was going to watch crazy and fun show, but all I got was a monster of the week borefest  <br> she </br>  <br>How is that an insult?</br>  <br>There can be no other.</br>  <br> deviantart fanart <br>Eeeuuuughhh<br>You are a huge disgusting faggot</br></br></br>  <br>it has cute robots. first time i saw this thing, i got the strangest boner</br>  <br>Nah thanks I like cute schoolgirl things like Hibike or K-ON m8</br>  <br> Star Driver <br> Secret </br></br>  <br> underrated <br>if anything, that jumbled up mess is overrated.</br></br>  It occurred to me that main villain is what would happen if you mashed Gendo Ikari and Kaworu Nagisa into one character.  24 episodes?  <br> tfw star driver sundays are over. </br>  More  <br>This is exactly why it's underrated.<br><br><br>Then why didn't you post her? That's second best girl and friends.<br><br><br>Yes. Everyone is incredibly attractive. It's a mecha anime uses mahou shoujo structure and explores adolescence. It's very good and there is some very good animation and you should watch it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it the same feeling as knowing there will never be a Gunvarrel anime? Fuck, I wish there was a Gunvarrel anime.</br>  I'll do some gif-dumping.<br><br>You should watch it. Still the best magical boy show.</br></br>  Ruri is my waifu.    We can all agree on the worst girl, right?    Best girl right here. So good they gave her a tan and her own show and called it Captain Earth.    Was the movie any good? I liked the anime but not enough to give it a re-watch.  <br>What do fish girl and Hana even have in common?</br>  More animes should have bisexual endings.<br><br>I think I'll stop there, that pretty much sums it up: glitter and lewdness and bisexuality.</br></br>  <br>As far as recap movies go, I thought it was actually a pretty good one. If you want to go through a lite version of the StarDriver experience again without committing to a full rewatch, I say go for it.<br><br>I wish it was a full sequel though, the little bit of new footage we got was nice.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait forgot gif</br>  <br><br>Yes anon she is.</br></br>  <br>Nah, dawg. That ending was straight gay. You know they didn't give a fuck about Wako when they came back.<br><br><br>The beginning of that movie was so painful to watch. It was so good and served as a reminder that we won't get a sequel.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0AF<wbr>w9pVg1SY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=AWB<wbr>HAEV14os</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I dunno man.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hana's song was criminally underused.

What the hell makes you think people haven't watched Star Driver? Star Driver Sundays were called that for a reason.<br><br>Also, I sincerely hope you're not calling yourself Secret Anime Anon, because 1) Star Driver is by no means a "secret anime" and 2) It's cringey as fuck.</br></br>  the only good thing about Star Driver was the animator fanservice, especially in the last episode. The rest was fairly shit.  <br>I hate that this is the way to express opinions on 4chan. Simply calling something shit hardly says anything and really doesn't encourage discussing.</br>  <br> I hate that this is the way to express opinions on 4chan <br>Then go somewhere else. Forums and blogs probably suite you better. Long, detailed and analytical posts are not inherent to the nature of imageboards.</br></br>  <br>I will start discussing. Do you think tiny Samekh was Columnar? And Sam?</br>  <br>Star Driver threads have always had a higher class of discourse. If it's 2fabulous4u, then leave.</br>  <br>Already saw it. Subpar, reused fight sequences for the most part. I was disappointed.<br><br>The mech designs were nice, though.</br></br></br>  i miss [gg] so much ;_;  <br>not dazzling, just gay</br>  <br>I thought it was pretty clear that Samekh was Columna's ship. I think Sam's story was specifically for Head and really about Head.</br>  <br>But Column IS the ship.</br>  <br> Best magical boy show <br>Implying there's any other magical boy show out there.<br><br>The "villians" of the show is cool though, even if they are rather episodic.

That and the Kiltgang just wasn't as interesting and fabulous as KIRABOSHI</br>  <br>The Kill-T-Gangs were interesting enough, the problem with Captain Earth is that it focused less on them than it should've, giving more attention to Salty Dog than necessary.</br>  <br>Someone watched Evangelion and decided you can't have a mecha show without a bunch of secret organization faggots.</br>  I always hated how this anime was entirely ignored by normalfags, by now I am glad because  FNAF proved that furries will draw porn of anything that looks like a animal, even magic wolf armors   Movie subs by gg never<br><br><br>That's not MC's mother, fucking NTR.</br></br></br>  So this happened.  <br>these are suppose to be porn movies sets or sets of a perverted japanese tv show.</br>    <br>RIP In Piece Pool-chan</br>  <br>Kajo thighs.</br>  <br>Is the nonon-type character just an archetype now? or was it before at all?</br>  So who's your hentaifu?<br><br>I can't decide between these two beautiful ladies.</br></br>  The grill on the right is a straight-up freak, yo  <br>That's why she's the best</br>  I will fap to Meat all day.    <br>I know the girl on the left.

The only good thing about Code Geass was the Jibun wo song.  BOKU NI PICO  <br>Code geass, the only good thing about death note was L and he was dead for half the series.</br>  <br>naruto is horrible, fuck off </br>  <br>Code Geass.</br>  Watch Death Note first, then refer to the manga, THEN watch Code Geass. THEN come back with your verdict<br><br> ten bucks says this scrub says Death Note cause his/her weeb friends said it was good </br></br>  <br>Code Gayass, it's so fucking fabulous!</br>  <br>fuck off I already watched both</br>  <br>maybe death note before they shit all over the series by killing the only interesting character</br>  <br>Code Geass. Death Note was boring after Light killed CIA's wife.</br>  <br>I don't get why that retarded series is so praised. it's one retarded plot twist after another.</br>  Death Note. At least with Death Note they bothered to explain their leaps in logic. Way better than lolGeass.  Death note was more mature and the characters were more real than whatever the fuck code geass did.  <br>Thank God the series ended when L died. I couldn't imagine some bullshit scenario to draw it out like there were secretly 2 prodigies being taught to replace L or some shit and they just hamfist some bullshit plot to make them work together to catch Light. That would be fucking retarded.</br>  <br>Code Geass.</br>  <br>I always pronounced it Code Geese</br>  <br> memecenter <br>codegeassfags everyone</br></br>  <br>First time I saw the title I thought it was Code Grease.</br>  <br>Code Geass<br><br>But i like more DN's art style</br></br></br>  <br> facebook tier image  <br>codegeassfags</br></br>  Code geass since lelouch isn't an overconfident Jew  <br>Either way, anything is better than Code Ge-ass<br><br> I'm getting better at these captchas </br></br></br>    <br> Death note was more mature <br>It looks more mature, it tried to be more mature, it really isn't.</br></br>  <br>But remember....

Not that the robots were bad. Though I like Code geass's mc and ending better. Both had dumb shit leading up to the end though.  <br>I would not be surprised if the author was forced to kill Light.</br>  <br>The manga ending was better than the anime. The shitty movie had a better ending than both.</br>  <br>What happened in the mangoes?</br>  <br> Both had dumb shit leading up to the end though </br>  <br>I think Light was supposed to die from the beginning but not under those circumstances.<br><br><br>No, ending was still shit in both of them. Light falling for the stupidest trap was absurd.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Light asked Ryuk to kill everyone. Ryuk starts writing a name in his Death Note, and Light thinks he's won, then Ryuk shows everyone that Ryuk wrote down Light's name. Since Light asked him for help, it means he doesn't have any backup plans, so he's not going to be entertaining anymore. Light flips his shit and begs Ryuk to erase his name, even though he knows that doesn't work. In the end, Light dies pathetically in front of everyone.</br>  <br>DN Finale&gt;CG Finale&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Shit&gt;&gt;&gt; Your taste </br>  <br>Wow that's 10000 times better.

It's really nice for a 14-year-old figure. It's still probably the best and most accurate Devilman figure available, at least that I've seen.  <br>I think it should've shown up by now, try contacting them but maybe you simply messed up the process somehow and it didn't place an order for you.</br>  How's yesasia for figures preorders? <br><br>I know they're not cheap, but the alternative being GSC's store with their 2000JPY shipping + 25% custom fees + 20€ of handling fee, well, yesasia actually ends up cheaper. <br><br>They don't cancel orders 3 days before the release date or something?

Something like "notice regarding change of release date".</br>  <br><br>How come you don't just sell all your figures that aren't on the items on fire list?</br></br>    <br>Seeing Mayoi again reminds me about how much I dislike that figure. They really fucked up the ribbon and her hair.</br>    <br>Buy a fishing tackle box and a bunch of small zip lock bags. I'd post a picture if what I got but I'm at work.</br>    nothing about this one yet?  Has the rakuten storefront improved recently, or is it still slow and expensive like the guide says? The info there hasn't been updated in quite a while<br><br>There's a gachapon shop that has full sets for retail price, and RSAL doesn't seem to cost more than the big sites</br></br>  <br>Lancer?</br>    <br>Yes. Garage kit.<br>https://twitter.com/ryoheifull</br></br>  <br>The gachapon store I order from forces EMS.

They are always fucking GKs.</br></br>    <br>Man I'm fucking jelly, there's almost no good merch of his manga design, it's always the<br> toei deviru that gets stuff<br><br><br>never mind that, I was looking at the estimated shipping, not the actual amount they charge</br></br></br></br></br>  bwack wok shootah    <br>Oh man</br>    <br><br><br><br>Can't you take an actual picture of your collections? No one wants to see those same thumbnails from MFC, but it's always nice to see people's rooms and collections.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I'm not them but these are mine</br>    <br> That sakura <br>That looks off</br></br>    <br>And it would be nice to see something else than these same pictures you have posted in these threads ten times already.</br>  <br><br>I know, it's such an old figure (2006)</br></br>  <br>Ok, here's mine. <br><br><br>I know what you mean. Toei Devilman is ok, but his design is kind of lame compared to the manga. I wish we'd get some newer figures of the design. The Medicom vinyl is almost 15 years old. It's nice though, and it did have a rerelease in 2012.</br></br></br></br>  <br>wasnt there a gamagori figure prototype from last year that never got finished? I remember there was some figure of him with the cannon from near the end of the series. Cant seem to find any info on it.</br>  <br><br>I'll take a better picture later.</br></br>  <br>STOP POSTING GARAGE KITS THIS IS TOO MUCH SUFFERING</br>  <br>nice ending https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8BK<wbr>WUtWxdcY</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I like your setup</br>  <br>sorry</br>    <br>A bit out of date, but I might as well post mine.</br>  <br>what happened to your scopedog?</br>  <br>OH THANK FUCKING GOD<br>Now maybe i can pay for my order.</br></br>  <br>That it is. It's the main reason I bought it. I still haven't watched Tokimeki, but I love the ed. <br><br><br>I'm too lazy to finish putting it together. I'll get to it eventually. I have a bunch of model kits still sitting in their boxes waiting to be put together.</br></br></br></br>  I swear one day I'll get into GKs.  <br>I'll never understand poor buyfags</br>  Anyone have better framing advice than the frames listed in the guide. They aren't even prime shipping.  <br>I'll repost my detolf setup. I managed to raise Sakura a little higher, so Syaoran's sword isn't cutting her head in half anymore</br>  <br>Why doesn't he have an Irish accent?<br>0/10</br></br>  <br>Soon, hopefully. Kirari is my third favourite CG behind Ranko and Anya  Mika doesn't count </br>  <br>I like your Bulma.</br>  <br>Is that Naoto a prize figure?</br>  <br>Did you paint your detolf? I've never seen it in white before.</br>  <br> buying figures of something you haven't seen/played <br><br>iM@S is fun, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>White detolfs look so nice. I'm still mad there wasn't any when I went to Ikea, so I had to buy black one.</br>  <br>using the snowball for a headphone stand. Dunno why I never thought of that</br>  <br>No, but after seeing the anon last thread with an iM@S movie poster I kinda want one.<br><br> I do have a framed poster of an actual 3D idol though </br></br></br>  <br>They sell them in white too.</br>  <br>I like her too<br><br><br>Nah, I bought it in white. I had to order it from overseas because we have no ikea on this island, so maybe physical stores would have different stock</br></br></br></br>  <br>Where's Len and Rin?<br><br>There are white detolfs and I think even plain wood.</br></br></br>  <br>I got the idea from Danny Choo, he posted a pic of his mic like that years ago and I just picked up on it.</br>  <br>They are coming soon, along with the fluffiest tank fairy</br>  <br>You have fantastic taste.</br>  <br>Did you stop enjoying things 15 years ago or do you only collect old things?</br>  <br>Looked better before paint. Yamatonokami's face looks awful.</br>  <br>She looked thick in the thumbnail. How disappointing.</br>  <br>I'm mainly into older series. I still like recent series too, see Dandy for instance, but most of my favorite anime and manga are from the 70s and 80s. <br><br><br>Thanks!</br></br></br></br>  cast off?  <br> those crazy lights <br>I guess I can't really judge, said I'd dust proof my billly and never did</br></br>  <br>That is definitely a woman's ass.</br>  <br>Not that there aren't some men's assessment like it, but don't apply 3D standards to 2D.</br>  <br>I PO'd it anyway, but I hope it is.</br>  <br> assessment <br>Fucking autocorrect. I would have sworn "asses" was already in my dictionary.</br></br>  <br>Even using 2D standards that's a woman's ass.

What does this have to do with Amico and Lilco?</br></br>  <br>I threw Tharsis on top of the display because I moved Ciel to its spot and I'm having space issues. I need to get on buying that second display for my nendos.</br>  <br>He didn't like the names of the girls in the card it seems</br>  <br>Oh, I thought he was talking about the AmiAmi mascot seasonal card.</br>  <br>this is getting an anime right? Is it good?</br>  <br>fucking fujo reeeee</br>  <br>If it gets better than what I played in the demo yes.<br>Otherwise can't really say.</br></br>  <br>Calm down, Pepe.</br>  <br> Tharsis <br>Do you mean the Sleipnir in the bottom left image? Is it any good? I thought about getting it but preordered the model kit instead.</br></br>  How do I get into this? <br><br>I've never made a model kit before but I really want this.</br></br>  <br>read /m/'s plamo guide</br>  <br>You mean "freeeee"?</br>  <br>Please redecorate.</br>  <br>why do fujos even bother to get the mechs when they can't even get the name right</br>  <br>Aldnoah was barely a mecha show, don't kid yourself.</br>  <br><br>Thanks, anon.</br></br>  <br>Shit, yeah. Tharsis being expensive as fuck was on my mind when I posted. It's okay but a bit of a hassle to change modes. I'm probably going to sell it eventually because non-nendo joints just aren't my thing  and A/Z was shit .</br>    <br>What are half of those boxes for?</br>  <br>what country are you in anon?</br>  <br>Those are figs boxes too</br>  <br>Yeah, but which figures?</br>  <br>New Zealand. Land of the fast shipping from Japan and heinously expensive and slow shipping from everywhere else.</br>  <br>Shit same where'd you order your detolf from?</br>  <br>There's a local store called Akia that orders and sells Ikea products, I ordered through them</br>  <br>Thanks!</br>  When does Megahouse usually announce release dates / delays?  <br><br>Collecting dust.</br></br>  <br>beginning of the month</br>  <br>Release Satsuki you pig</br>  Deadline in one hour  <br><br>Fairly old shitty picture of my &gt;Jointshit<br><br>This was before I got into scales</br></br></br></br>  <br>These ones.<br><br>She's pure and immaculate inside that box</br></br></br>  <br>I request Chariot's pose. I swear, she's a bitch to pose, and I can't ever seem to get it right.<br>I think I see the idea in yours, and I'd like to copy.</br></br>  <br> Uzumaki <br> Gyo <br> Kaiji <br><br>Not bad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you say so.</br>  <br> Beach Queens <br> sealed <br><br>For what purpose?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I really should've gotten Chariot, she looks fun if you can get a good pose going. Scale never.</br>  <br> fucking shit why didn't I save the screepcap of that story </br>  Anon you there?  <br>She does look fun, but let me tell you, posing her is not. See all those poses in GSC's site? I'm pretty sure you cannot do any of those. It just doesn't work that way.</br>  <br><br>Glad I'm not the only one. I can't even do any of the poses on the box. I won't kill myself over it though, I don't even have the rest of the cast.</br></br>  <br>I plan to  build  a deltof once I move out from my parents. Until then I keep all the figs on the boxes</br>  <br><br>It's too late for that now but i'll post it tomorrow,<br>FUCK trying to get that shield on though.</br></br></br>  <br>I have BRS and DM, plus a broken BGS. All original ver. Never got Strength because those hands look impossible.</br>  <br>I don't either, but all BRS, STR and her are kinda shit to pose. <br>Chariot's shield is too big and doesn't have enough holes for the stand, legs are stiff and the hair is bothersome for the stand.<br>STR's hands are too big too. Broke stands trying to do anything with her. Fortunately I'm happy with her pose, and don't feel the need to ever touch her again.<br>BRS is on the easier side, but the site's pictures are clearly photoshoped. The cannon is literally floating in the air in one.<br><br><br>Her hand snapped in me while trying to put her hand. Glued it back on so now it's hard to take it out. I just gave up and made her unrealistically grab the shield with the fist only. No arm inside the thingy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I just noticed the Umaru nendo was delayed till september, but it's still in my august order on amiami, is that weird?  <br>no</br>  <br>Fuck IDK if I should order two.</br>  <br><br>STR isn't as hard as people make her out to be, the only problem is balancing her right, honestly i'm just happy I got the TV ver. because the OVA ver. looks like shit.<br><br>I guess it also helps to say that I preferred the Series over the OVA<br><br> Kagari figma when </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kagari figma when <br>No. Give me a god damn scale.

Preferably 3rei next year because we all know it's going to happen.</br></br></br></br>  So now that the dust has settled, what do you think about the Punk Hazard arc? Personally I thought that the part with the kids was a bit too long and yeah it was meant to be a pre-arc/build-up arc for dressrosa, but I still thought that it was pretty good as a standalone. The only thing that was really off is that Ceasar was the main villian. The endboss, the last one fighting before baby 5 arrived, should have been Vergo in my opinion. It would also have been good if law took out the arc boss in taht arc instead of luffy who got doffy in dressrosa.  <br>Quick, who best jeans</br>  <br>You should shop at Edge 'R' Us.</br>  <br>already had this one</br>    <br> that stance </br>  Who is your least favorite yuru, and why?<br><br>Hard mode: Not Chinatsu, Chizuru, or Chitose<br><br>Personally, Himawari is probably my least favorite of the eight yurus.<br><br> overdone feminine speech (even Ayano uses the feminine speech more naturally). &gt;rude around Sakurako but maintains her ojousama facade around other people <br> lacks dynamics with anyone other than Sakurako <br><br>Not baiting or hating though, honest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Akari and Chinatsu at the same time.</br>  <br>You saw it somewhere, and repeated it, it's a meme.</br>  <br>Don't even fucking say Akari's name in the same sentence as that bitch niggas.</br>  <br>I saw it in the show</br>  <br>Onions this cute can't be old.</br>   anime has a narrator    show doesn't bother taking the time to explain every minute detail to the viewer   <br>shit show</br>  <br><br> implying that's a bad thing </br></br>  <br> implying </br>  <br>Kaiji had an amazing narrator.</br>  Anyone else like watching anime while high?  not really<br>it feels good, but i never seem to remember what happened later</br>  DUDE IMMA LIKE TOTALLY WASTED LMAO  dubs tbh  Check em tbh fam  <br>It's a likely a couple of shitposters who had a bad experience or never had any friends who offered it, so they think it's degenerate.
