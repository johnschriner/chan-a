[ Why does she wear the shorts?  No one cared who she was until she put on the shorts.<br> She didn't wear them as a loli, so this is actually true. </br>  Why was that phone service provider so homophobic?  <br>   so this is actually true. <br>No it isn't, because people cared about her as a loli.<br>Stop bringing /tv/ memes to /a/ and stop being stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>Better question is why doesn't Touma upgrade to a better model.</br>  <br>Homosexuality is a horrible mental illness, anon. You should probably get yourself checked</br>  Maybe her butt hurts  She's watched enough anime to know extra protection is needed.  <br>Because shorts are great for qt tomboys</br>  <br> short life span <br> no tangible personality outside of deadpan trolling <br><br>It's too depressing to think about.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Because she wants to be able to run around freely and she can't do that with Tokiwadai's required short skirt.</br></br>  More like:<br>Why is the Tokiwadai winter uniform so great?</br>  <br>How does it feel to be an idiot?</br>  <br><br>There not shorts there boxers that she puts on backwards for Touma's easy access when ever they want a quicky. (See NT7 cover).</br></br>  <br>Best Misaka</br>  <br><br>Best bum too.</br></br>  <br>It's literally identical to all the other Misakas.</br>  <br>How does adding more clothing make it easier to run?</br>  <br>Agreed.</br>  She is a lvl 5 so she is a celebrity. Everyone is looking at her every time. She does not want anyone to see her pantsu  <br><br>Because the shorts cover up her panties and she doesn't have to be careful about her movements because of it? <br><br>She fucking says this herself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because they are comfy, and easy to wear. <br> NOW LETS BATTLE </br></br>  <br>A pure maiden like her is very conscious of her modesty.</br>  <br>She doesn't seem to care about modesty when she's lusting after Touma's Dick like a whore.</br>  <br>Touma doesn't count. All life is sexually attracted to Touma.</br>  <br>TouMAN does that to everyone though.</br>    <br>If you pulled them off would she die?</br>  Kamikoto a cutest pairing    <br>A lot of modesty for a Level 5.</br>  <br><br>Kamisaten, however, is the sexiest. Level Zero Love is alive and well.</br></br>  <br> Love <br>Habitual rape is not love.</br></br>  Touma could unite a harem the likes of which has never been seen if only he could COOK.  <br><br> if only he could COOK <br><br>He can. His cooking skills have improved considerably since Index moved in. Using bare bones ingredients to make delicious meals.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He does cook, but he has to work with shit tier ingredients</br>  <br>I want to see Shirou and Touma broing about morality.</br>  <br><br>Can't he pleasure level 5s for money?</br></br>  <br>Touma would beat up Shirou for trying to sacrifice himself constantly. even though he does the same.</br>  <br><br> Misaki paying Touma to be a gigolo </br></br>  <br>And then Shirou would beat up Touma because he is trying to sacrifice himself for him.</br>  <br>And then they fuck.</br>  <br>I wonder if Touma's hand thing works on Shirou.</br>  <br>Because she has a bad habit of kicking shit when she goes MAXIMUM OVER TSUN against vending machines. <br>She only hits them because they don't do what she wants without a little negative reinforcement. <br>It's why she treats Touma the same way.</br></br></br>    <br>Its magic so it will</br>  <br>Was ruining his meme part of your plan?</br>  <br>Well it could work on reinforcement, though I don't remember if it is a one time thing or it's something that Shirou has to constantly spend mana on, since that would have an Innocentius like reaction.</br>  <br>Would it work on his projections? Cause they are good enough in to fooling the world in to not destroying them to keep the world the same, and thats pretty much what IB does, so would it fool IB too?</br>  <br>Projections are still made from mana so I think IB would work on them, since it's constantly draining mana from his surroundings.</br>  <br>I think its somewhat iffy, cause the reason it drains the mana is because it doesnt belong there, but these projections fool the world in to believing that they do belong there, which is why he does not need to keep pumping mana in to them to keep them active. I get what you are saying and it would make sense if IB was just something that was anti magic.</br>  <br><br><br>A better question is if Kamijou "Slug Like a Thug" Touma could beat Shirou in a fight even if his hand does break his projections.</br></br></br>  <br>When Misaka shoots lightning at him she creates a magnetic field that makes real electrons fly in his direction.<br>He doesn't cancel out the field which he can't touch. He destroys the electrons.</br></br>  <br>Maybe. Shirou is more /fit/ though.</br>  <br><br><br>Actually, Shirou is pretty fit himself. Even without magic he is pretty swole. <br><br>Touma only seems to be a good fighter because he can cancel an opponent's primary means of fighting, leaving them to rely on their physical skills which are likely neglected, as they don't actually need them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno, man. Shirou "The Hero better than the Level Zero" Emiya does exercise every morning and has super high jump technique and he's not even part of the track and field club.</br>  <br>I thought that esper powers are based off the esper replacing reality with their own personal reality?<br><br>so it works like<br> Misaka convinces the world that electrons can be fired around the place <br> Imagine Breaker calls bullshit <br> Misaka's personal reality is removed <br><br>Or did i misunderstand it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably not unless he can moralfag speech him in to letting himself get beat up. All Shirou would have to do is trace something powerful and the sword would do the rest. Touma cant keep up with saint speed and Shirou can get to pretty close to that depending on what weapon he traces. And even without that he is pretty good at fighting, so he could probably just bring a wooden sword and beat him up</br>  <br>Her power is electromagnetism, not electron-manipulation.</br>  <br>So the same way that UBW works?</br>  <br>Shirou could just cut off touma's arm right?<br>:^)</br></br>  <br>Don't use emoticons on /a/.</br>  <br>Touma could still catch a cannonball midflight and shit on Rensa.</br>  <br>Assuming I'm correct</br>  can shirou stop the dragon things in touma arm  <br>Thats like begging to get rekd</br>  <br> going back through your myspace from 2005 <br><br>I was such a little faggot</br></br></br>  <br>When will these two fuck?</br>  <br>After he fucks Othinus.</br>  <br>Well that is how the espers work as far as I know. There is probably more to it that we don/t know about yet that has not been presented to us.</br>  <br>That site still exists?</br>  <br>They eventually do in  index3 </br>  <br>So to our current knowledge, Touma can negate UBW<br><br>we will know use this knowledge to learn why misaka wears shorts under her skirt</br></br></br>    The answer is obvious folks.<br><br>To hide the truth.

I've still been kind of enjoying it.</br>  <br>That's not Mushoku Tensei nor onii-sama.</br>  <br>kinda stopped caring about it after he became an Ogre.<br><br>before he at least had to be a little strategic since he was physically weaker than a lot of his prey, But now he just curb-stomps them and returns to his orgy.</br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty fucking bad. What's mostly hilarious though is that you can clearly tell that in the beginning of the story, the author fully intended the protagonist to be a perfect Mary Sue that is completely morally unambiguous despite doing really kind of evil shit and only later does the author go, "Oh no, I totally meant that all along." after presumably commenters went, "Man, this dude does some fucked up shit."</br>  <br>Rudi isn't a mary sue at all.</br>  <br>ok</br>  Yeah it becomes really mastubatory after he starts having orgies with the harem. Kumo desu ga, Nani Ka? is the same premise but a better story because the MC barely evades death and is weak compared to most enemies so there's actual tension.  <br>Don't know why you posted just to say ok, but as long as you agree.<br><br>Onii-sama is a mary sue though though I still think trap mech onii-sama is worse.</br></br></br>  <br>I've been entertained by him curb-stomping his enemies so far, but it will grow old soon if things stay that way. I think I would enjoy the concept of someone who gains power by eating his enemies if that was a common trait in the setting, if people in general evolved by killing and feeding. It could lead to interesting interpersonal and societal dynamics, especially if it wasn't quite as edgy as it could be.</br>  Gun ota  <br>Didn't that guy that has shit magic technique and get his shit stolen and made into a slave?<br>Gun-ota is pretty bad but he's pretty balanced compared to most OPMCs.<br><br>World Teacher on the other hand.</br></br></br></br>  Are any of these things translated by actual people and not alien robots crudely pretending they understand the English language?  <br>The author wanted a vampire Loli, so they stripped his ass of everything than gave him two fucking countries because dragon inventor and pounding vampire Loli pussy.</br>  <br> World Teacher <br>Pure fucking shit. Bu ni mi is more interesting.</br></br>  <br>just assume the latter<br><br>I think only three people actually translate these things.</br></br></br>  <br> perfect Mary Sue that is completely morally unambiguous despite doing really kind of evil shit <br><br>Yeah this is the worst fucking bit, rape is looked down upon so the perfect Mary sue MC couldn't possibly allow it so he feeds drugs to the elf prisoners and tell his goblins that they need 'consent' to fuck them as a way to go around rape even though it's the same fucking thing. <br><br>I'd be better if he straight up allowed his goblins to what they wished with the elves rather than being a sanctimonious fucker about it.</br></br></br></br></br>  Hope the series ends the way it began.<br><br>With Mi just catching him off guard and killing him out of a fit of jealousy with a lightning-magic imbued dagger.</br></br>  <br>Now she can easily bukkake human forts though(she literally says bukkake)</br>  <br>Mushoku tensei makes me cringe</br>  <br>Good let it flow through you</br>  <br>really? why?</br>  <br>But this time he dies for real, forever.<br><br>Priceless.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know I kinda want another reincarnation<br><br>and endless recursion of being OP as all hell only to be stabbed to death by a yandere.</br></br></br>   mc is a loser who dies and is reborn in another world as a gary stu <br>I drop everything that begins like that</br>  <br>No, no. This one begins with MC is a Gary Stu who dies and is reborn in another world as a Gary Stu.</br>  <br>usually reincarnation series about gary stus are "MC is a gary stu that dies and is reborn in another world as a gary stu"<br><br>Like Re:monster</br></br></br>    WOW LOOK AT THE ORIGINAL FANTASY I CREATED <br>  AND LOOK AT THIS IT WORK EXACTLY LIKE A VIDEO GAME. <br><br>There is literally no LN, manga, anime or crude drawing on a napkin that can make an entertaining story using this, it's a redflag and only underage fags think it's good.</br></br></br>  <br>Its just self-insert wish fulfillment bullshit man</br>  <br>When did he have an orgy with his harem? Did a new chapter drop?</br>  I'm enjoying that slime reincarnated manga  <br>The ones with the mc being a loser before are even worse</br>  <br>Yeah but it's done right. There's actual characterization, conflicts, plot, and drama and the MC is powerful but not completely broken (dragon god is though).<br><br>Can't really say that for most series in its genre.</br></br></br>  <br>with the loser one there's at least some "issues" the Mc has to deal with.<br><br>with the gary stu one it's gary stu A becomes gary stu B.</br></br></br>  <br>It's even worse when there are no actual explicit bullshit video game mechanics but everything still inexplicably works like an RPG with idiotic spells and items and shit.<br><br>Also, adventurer's guild that works with ranking system, every single fucking one.<br><br>I don't understand. Even in the worst of manga, this kind of shit is pretty uncommon, they at least try to pretend they have a world that isn't based on RPG mechanics. Yet every other one of these does this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll still reading this. I'm waiting the growth of his child, maybe it would get better.<br><br><br>But anon, Mushoku Tensei is good. Can't say its excelent but it is above average.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, have to admit that a ranking system for an adventurer guild makes sense. I mean, if I was in charge of what's basically a medieval staffing agency I wouldn't give some new guy my most difficult jobs until I knew he could handle it.</br>  <br>What's it about and what happens in it to make it live up to that claim?</br>  <br>No, the worst one is the fantasy Gary Stu story who is reincarnation of 2 Gary Stu with different power which make him the Gary Stu-est.<br> World Break </br></br>  <br>Nah. There's a lot to like, mostly world building. that actually has some thought put into it (but not too much that it reaches back into stupid territory). I've seen way worse self-insert garbage than this.</br>   Good idea  <br> intelligent MC <br>BUTT<br> no challenges <br> power scaling doesn't make sense <br>thank wish-fulfillment for making yet another potential story garbage</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>second post pretty much nails it off the bat. <br><br>Re:Monster is without a doubt, wish fulfillment from start to finish. Even when Rou loses his arm he is quickly provided with a artifact to replace it before it becomes a inconvenience.<br><br>Still, it's not nearly as blatant as Arifureta. Arifureta is only ever amusing when you imagine it being self aware of the main character being this huge chuuni edge lord with white hair, guns in a fantasy setting and a dark black coat. It's so bad you can sort of derive amusement from just how blatant it is.<br><br>Honestly the thing that gets me the most about Arifureta is watching the author use characters as a mouth piece to try and explain why Haijime is right. It gets very silly at moments, especially when it sets a strawman for those characters to make this point at.<br><br>If I was smart I would have dropped this a long time ago, but it's like a terrible habit I can't stop. Please help me Anon. I have a problem.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yeah but it's done right. <br>A story about a neet pedofile loser in a straight video game MMORPG copy paste world, that has ridiculous power while being a complete pussy.<br>The author is a NEET, and you clearly can't enjoy it unless you're a neet as well. It's shitty escapism, it's even worse than World Teacher.</br></br></br>  I actually would want to see his past life over this; a human hero who eats his foes to gain their powers sounds like a fun morality tale, unless the author manages to fuck it up.  <br>no where near as bad as arifureta when it comes to blatant wish fullfillment</br>  <br>Most of what you just said doesn't apply to the series (especially not the MMO part).</br>  <br>Keep telling yourself that.</br>  <br> MC dies and is reborn as weak-ass goblin <br> In a fantasy world with RPG mechanics that let him level up and class change into other monsters <br> But he's a super-duper special snowflake with a special ability to eat things and gain their power for himself <br> He quickly becomes the most powerful being existence, making everyone a slave/follower and fucking his harem of hot women whenever he wants <br> Most of the story is him streamrolling his inferior opponents </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> this is the worst, most blatant wish-fulfillment mary sue fantasy to ever come out of Japan? <br><br>No, it's not. <br>It's just one of the worst in "decently popular title that has been fan translated" <br><br>There are plenty of even shittier ones in web novel sites, you just don't know them because they're either obscure or haven't been translated.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you read it or just read the summery and went "nope"? (latter is understandable since the summery just doesn't do the series justice).</br>  <br>Mushoku Tensei may be wish-fulfillment, but it's the positively good type. <br>It's about regret and becoming better. It doesn't fulfill your power fantasies, it makes you wish you had a chance to make better choices and become a better person. <br>And no, it's not Mary Sue at all. <br><br>Not fair at all comparing it to this power masturbation.</br></br></br></br></br>  I personally enjoy this thing  <br>Become better, by fantasizing and having sex with underage girls. Great stuff.<br>Whatever differences Mushoku Tensei has with this are arbitrary. They're both shit, Mushoku just being the greater and more steaming pile of shit, meant for even more morally bankrupt people than Re:monster. Don't try to draw imaginary lines, you can't have both.</br></br>  <br>Not the same person but I read through most of the first volume and<br> A story about a neet pedofile loser in a straight video game MMORPG copy paste world <br>seems a pretty apt description. Though the stupid RPG-esque stuff is mostly just the lazy shit that a lot of Japanese fantasy stories do for some unfathomable reason, including manga and shit.<br><br>I don't really give a shit if it becomes good in Volume 4 or whatever either, not picking that up again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> muh moral </br>  <br>Have you actually read Mushoku Tensei?<br>I mean, the impression I get is that you don't. At all. <br>It's really more about growing up (despite having a 30+ year old memory), family, losing family, and regaining family. <br><br>It's not at all a easy going harem fantasy you seem to imagine. I really don't believe you read the book AT ALL.</br></br></br></br></br>  Will Yorai-kun continue translating ``I Kinda Came To Another World, But Where’s The Way Home´´?<br>Like it because the MC is pretty much Kumagawa.</br>  <br>I'm sorry, I don't give a shit about or can't relate to people that want to raise a harem of underaged girls. <br>Not really..</br></br>  What's wrong with wish fulfillment, it's fun  Started yesterday reading Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka?,<br>How can a ugly spider monster be so kawaii?.</br>  <br>yeah first volume is pretty standard for those types of series.<br><br>But whereas a lot of series show promise at first only to throw it out the window. First volume of MT seems generic only to get better and better 3rd volume onward.<br><br>MT in this thread is like having a thread all about "generic harems you hate" and someone putting the Tenchi on it. It's a harem, girls are after the MC's dick, and the MC doesn't exactly fuck them (at least not in the OVA), but putting it together with the likes of IS and Kampfer makes you think "this nigga is retarded."</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mushoku Tensei only gets worse though.</br>  <br>are you just trolling?</br>  <br>Wait what nigga<br><br>The only one that applies is that one sex Rudy had with Eris at the end of their journey. <br>All the other sex happened after Rudy got married when they were grown up<br><br>What's this underage harem you're talking about</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it's shit and it legitimately only gets shittier.</br>  <br>Your opinion is not legitimate. Mine is.</br>  <br>I'm confused are you the guy who only read one volume or the guy that only post vague and incorrect descriptions?</br>  <br>That's /a/ for you, people opine without even reading the source</br>  <br><br> confirmed for not reading not even ch 1 of vol 1 <br>There is no MMO bullshit. Stop speaking about stuff you don't even know.</br></br></br>  <br>That s true but I m enjoying it because, contrary to Sword Art Online, this manga knows he is just telling us a shit story. It s not taking itself seriously while Kirito kun was clearly intended to be admirable.</br>  <br> can't relate to people that want to raise a harem of underaged girls <br>And i can't relate to someone with this shitty of taste.</br></br>  YOU DON'T LET YOUR BREEDING WOMEN KILL THEMSELVES<br><br>THAT'S NOT RIGHT<br><br>YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PLEASURING THEM</br></br></br></br>  <br> underage <br> not knowing about the great Goddes of Wisdom also known as the Gold digger </br></br>  <br>technically all LN/WN are SAO-clones according to /a/, no exceptions.</br>  <br>to be fair, that is mostly true</br>  <br>This is true</br>  <br>I'm a different anon, MT legitimately only gets worse. It has some potential in the beginning with the MC learning the mechanics of magic while seemingly having some purpose but it quickly turns into shit after or actually during the travelling arc where they get sent into whatever generic name the beast land has. It becomes a story about a loser doing nothing and having erection problems. It's maybe the worst shit I've ever read.</br>  By the way No game No Life vol 7 raw is out and within 2 days we will get prologue in english.  <br>Nah, Rudy is one but people keep defending him. The series went down pretty much before the end but overall was a great ride.<br><br>Onii-sama was designed to be feared in the series, and not as a model of hero or something like that, which is a common trope nowadays. Also, compared with others he is really balanced once you get to read things like arifureta or suterareta yuusha.<br><br>The difference is people can't really self insert as a young talented engineer, nor even want to be one that writes volumes of technical text etc, compared with one who travels and enjoy his life getting wives and powers.<br><br><br>What about a non loser who dies and keeps being a non loser in the next life?<br><br><br>It IS power fantasy, everything develops around Rudeus being a great magician. Him being a irregularity in that universe is the whole point of him being deceived by Hitogami, and that's thanks to his magic and relationships, so yeah, it's not only about family.<br>Heck, all his wives are related to him pretty much because he was for each case<br><br>Eri; a 10 year old (?) genius to teach her magic<br>Silphy; saed her and taught her magic<br>Roxy; being his teacher, and later being saved by him<br><br>Made him a normal dude without magic nor swordsmanship and then you can talk about only family things. <br><br><br>For me the 1st volume was shit tier writing, but also fun and the one that got me engaged with the series.<br><br>I agree with it being good afterwards, but it also had boring parts and later him being orsted lackey made it worse for me. Cliff's arc was the last one and the one that made me drop it. I only get to read the last chapters and didn't bother reading the rest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I haven't read it yet, but honest question:<br>we always complain about dickless mcs who have harems and don't do anything more than an accidental kissu<br>how is having an orgy a bad thing?</br></br></br>  <br> translated by someone who can actually write stuff that isn't painful to read <br><br> only two chapters </br></br></br>  <br>I don't know<br>that is a pretty vague and incorrect description <br><br> mixing two arcs together <br> confusing two entire continents with one another </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah, because the adventurers guild and stuff like fucking "saint/king/emperor/god rank techniques/magic", "beast races" and "demon races" are not MMORPG at all.</br>  <br>Rudi keeps getting his ass kicked by people stronger than them.<br><br>Most gary stus don't get their ass kicked, or have people stronger than them (unless they were on their side).<br><br> Rudi will never defeat his father in battle </br></br></br></br></br>  Literally the only character with common sense in the whole fucking fate universe.<br><br> Died </br></br>  <br> Comon sense <br> Killed hundreds or maybe thousands of innocents  <br><br>It's somewhat bizarre the fact that he killed Shirou's family and adopted him. Is also Bizarre that Shirou never thinks about it</br></br></br></br>  <br> killed shirou's family <br>More like failed to save Shirou's family</br></br>  Your underage is showing.  <br>Thanks for spoiler faggot.</br>  <br>Being on /a/, caring about F/Z plot</br>  <br>Don't mistake pessimism for realism. He assumes the worst possible outcome in any given situation. His most proficient magic was related to time and its manipulation to change outcomes. His worldview only works when everyone around you is trying to kill and betray you.</br>  <br>It still works if everyone around you wants to help you, given how fucked up it is.</br>  <br><br> dedicates his entire life and lineage to a stupid, incredibly painful and stressful cause because "muh villiage" <br><br>That's pretty much the opposite of common sense, unless you were referring only to how he fights.</br></br></br></br>  <br>His ideology may be stupid, but his way of fighting gets shit done, instead of muh magic honour, no guns allowed</br>  <br>Kiritsugu had to die for the same reason Spike had to die. The antihero doesn't get to see the world saved because he doesn't want to. He just wants to hurt the bad guys.</br>  <br>SIX BILLION PEOPLE</br>  <br>The series would have been better if there are other's that know how to bend the rules like him</br>  <br>That's more like the only magus with a combat sense rather than common sense.<br>Magecraft isn't made for fighting to begin with, so why should magi have combat sense, exactly? This is like demanding a scientist know exactly how to turn their chemicals into high explosives and where to place them to bring down architecture.</br></br>  <br>Isn't that what scientists are doing today?</br>  <br>The level to which Gilgamesh would completely wreck his shit forever is a big reason why not. The power levels in the show fluctuate like its fucking DBZ. Tohsaka goes toe to toe with fucking caster. For a prolonged period of time. Guns have a pretty finite power level so he's tied to the same fate as homura where he uses guns and bombs while Gilgamesh is fucking opening the earth's womb and drawing out the concept of 'sword' and cutting time and space or some shit.<br><br>I mean he basically is homura vs god madoka at that point so I guess we could see some cool power stealing shit but it wouldn't be fun.</br></br></br>  <br>Yea the part about scientists breaking down buildings makes sense, i'm not joking</br>  <br>And in every route ,in every series, lancer dies a shitty death</br>  <br>There are weapons scientists, but if you think a geologist or a neurologist would make a good one then you have no idea what science fields even do.</br>  <br>The powerlevels in F/SN and Zero are very consistent, Nasu and Uro just know that being more powerful doesn't mean you're going to win.</br>  <br>Got me there man :c lancer is my favorite class. <br>I don't know the show is fucking retarded and at the end of the day its the power of friendship that wins it all and nothing matters.</br></br>  <br>You're actually retarded if you think the "power of friendship" has any role in F/SN and Zero.<br><br>The only Fate work Nasu's written where that shit shows up is CCC.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought CCC was the power of love.<br>Not, like, "I l-like you senpai" love but "I want to ride your dick" love.</br></br>  <br>I thought "i love you senpai" and "i want to ride your dick" aren't mutually exclusive?</br>  <br>A human being has the most powerful noble phantasm in Stay which is powered by mana given to him by his friend/love interest. The noble phantasm being a plane of existence where he is basically a god.<br><br>And we are comparing this to where he was earlier in the series making sticks slightly harder.</br></br></br>  <br> Unlimited Blade Works <br> "the most powerful noble phantasm" <br> "where he is basically a god" <br>You don't actually know anything about this story, do you?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Reality marble in which he can copy all other weapons and their abilities as long as he has seen them. Just about every other class' offensive noble phantasm is based upon their weapons so he technically has access to that too. <br><br>So he just copies rule breaker, makes a hundred copies and fires them around just doing whatever the fuck he wants because that's what Unlimited Blade Works does.</br></br></br>  <br>Creating a hundred copies of Rule Breaker would be functionally useless, Rule Breaker has to be personally stabbed into someone. It doesn't work at range.<br>Beyond that, it doesn't kill servants, merely sever the connection to their master. Almost all servants can still fight on after that, Berserkers excluded.<br>Beyond that, effectively all servants can deal with a barrage of 100 copies of the same extremely shitty weapon.</br></br></br>  <br>I love kiri2gu but it's better when he dies. It also makes F/SN much more tragic in retrospect, considering how Shirou tries to follow in his footsteps.</br>  <br> common sense <br><br> fucked up in Fate due to Fuyuki fire <br> most likely fucked up in Prisma resulting in adoption <br> still fucks up in Miyuverse by going mind of steel again </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rule Breaker is not nearly that 1 dimensional. Rule Breaker ACTUALLY negates magical contracts with objects and people and noble spirits it comes into contact with. It causes magical bindings and contracts to 'betray' the other party of the contract. <br><br>So you could theoretically use it to break the connection with Gilgamesh's treasures and the Gate of Babylon, for an example.</br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't work on NPs</br>  <br>He was trying to be morally gray and never realised he was stuck in a black and white setting. That' no common sense.</br>  <br>Archer and Gilgamesh endings are pure friendship. Yes, even as a girl.<br><br><br>This may surprise you but UBW is actually pretty shit by Reality Marble standards and is mid tier as an NP.<br><br>Its also not powered by friendship.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> UBW is actually pretty shit by Reality Marble standards <br>I don't actualy think you can realy compare RMs.<br>I mean how do you compare it to Lair of the Beast King for example?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm just saying that its raw combat potential is seemingly lower than most of the other ones we've seen before.<br><br>Its obviously got its niches where its way better than some of them and such, but its still not the best of them.</br></br></br>  <br>No, that's bullshit.<br>  Of course, there are limits. No matter how low the rank, it is impossible for Rule Breaker to affect a Noble Phantasm. <br><br>It only works on magecraft, which most heroes don't use.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What is the raw combat potential of a World filled with Chaos?<br>What is the raw combat potential of Sacchin's RM?<br> Remember it only drains ambivalent mana , not the odd </br></br></br>  <br> What is the raw combat potential of a World filled with Chaos? <br><br>Considering that the description of it is nearly exactly the same as the description of EA's attack? Probably huge, not to mention what we know of it non-speculatively is insane.<br><br> What is the raw combat potential of Sacchin's RM? <br><br>Not to sure, never played Melty Blood so I've not seen much of her.<br><br>Caster in Extra/CCC and Iskander both have pretty strong ones as well, and unlike UBW aren't said by Nasu to be pretty useless versus most servants so it can be assumed they're well above it on the tier list.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Caster in Extra/CCC <br>What?<br> Considering that the description of it is nearly exactly the same as the description of EA's attack? Probably huge, not to mention what we know of it non-speculatively is insane. <br>I mean he's basicaly unkillable but that's because he constantly deploys it in his own body.<br>The only 3 "offensive" moves he has are<br> spitting out parts of himself that become some sort of animal, he can't controll what comes out <br> Absorbing people if they are trapped <br> turning into the 999th Beast <br> I'm an absolute Nero-fag but he's hard to quantify offensively </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Iskander  <br>That's a noble phantasm that functions like a reality marble, not truly a reality marble.</br></br>  <br>Correct me if i am wrong but isn't Nrvnrsqr's beasts are a sort of RM(what i mean is that he basically has his RM on at all times to summon beasts and shit). <br>And Sacchin's RM, from what i've gathered, pretty much drains mana from everyone inside of it at a fast rate but don't take my word for it, could just be one of her abilities.<br><br>And i never played with Caster in Extra but i heard that as a heroic spirit she is pretty OP.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a non-conventional reality marble. It's a world egg that can be deployed. We have reality marble subspecies, so not everything literally has to be internal world --&gt; external world.</br>  <br>Meant Alice, not Tamamo. Should have been more clear.<br><br> I'm an absolute Nero-fag but he's hard to quantify offensively <br><br>True, its hard to determine his exact power level, but I still feel its a safe bet its higher up there than UBW.<br><br><br>Its an irregular RM, but it still is one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alice is a cheater and Archer still defeats her, so how could the queen's glass game be above UBW?</br>  <br>Because you use the Vorpal Blade to counter the Jabberwocky aspect of it. It'd be impossible for him to normally defeat her by his own power.</br>  <br> but i heard that as a heroic spirit she is pretty OP. <br>You heared wrong.<br>She's one of the weakest servants seen so far.</br></br></br>  <br>Nigger what<br><br>Tamamo is a fucking monster, she's mid-high tier in Extra and an utter beast in CCC</br></br></br>  <br>She's literaly the weakest out of the 3 low tier servants you can chose from.</br>  <br>CCC involves her getting her Origin form and then being boosted by the Mooncell due to being an aspect of a Solar goddess. Normally shed not be nearly that strong as a Servant.<br><br>You're right though, even normally she's a very respectably powerful Caster.</br></br></br>  <br> Nero <br> Archer <br> low-tier <br><br>Now I KNOW you're messing about. They're both mid-tier at worst.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>As a real heroic (or monstrous) spirit, Tamamo is unfathomably powerful.<br>But Hakuno didn't summon her that way, and got the mortal Tamamo, who is amusingly pathetic, but tries really hard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> As a real heroic (or monstrous) spirit, Tamamo is unfathomably powerful. <br>Only in the monstrous form.</br></br>  <br>Tamamo is mid-tier at worst as a servant even in Extra where she is at her weakest in canon.</br>  <br> being able to defeat Lu Bu, Shuwen, Gawain and a gimped Arc <br> low-tier </br></br>  <br>You are aware that this is literaly stated to only be possible because of Hakuno, right?</br>  <br> Artificially boosted by Aoko </br>  <br> fighting for utopia <br> pessimist </br></br>  <br>Sorry but please reread F/Z or even watch the anime if you don't realise that Kerry is a pessimist</br>  <br> getting your true stats restored after having them all reduced to E rank by a shit master <br> "artificially boosted" <br><br><br>Hell if anything its doubly impressive she probably beat most of them while still somewhat weakened</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> true stats, could literally give her EX strength if you wanted to gimp her. <br><br>I imagine you if stopped at her real stats, the later game would probably suck.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope you're just shit at comprehension.</br>  <br>It's not like enemy masters were complete retards though.<br><br><br>They mostly say "oh i got closer to my true power, nice". They only really say "wow you got my stats higher than they actually were" once you get them too high, around EX or so. And i only got them that high when i was messing around with cheat engine to see stats-damage relation(and it appears that pretty much every stat boosts your melee and skill damage, even luck; fucking Caladbolg went from 3k or so to 7k after i boosted luck or agility, don't remember, each stat increases damage by different amount though but it still increases) so you'd need some grinding or focusing only on one stat. <br>I actually beat the game without super charging my servants or anything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her true stats are pretty much the recommended build for her.<br><br>Small amount of phys stuff for early game, then just pump mana absurdly high.</br></br></br>  <br> Only character with common sense  <br> Not mentioning Waver or Kayneth <br><br>Heck, even Tokiomi was less of an idiot.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kaynet <br> I'm just gonna walk straight into the base/workshop of one of the 3 founding families of the grail war <br> Tokiomi <br> that Zouken fellow sure seems trustworthy, as does Kotomine <br><br>I think Rin probably has the most "common" sense unless it's about social situations</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>According to Uro, Tokiomi felt like Sakura could take care of herself, trials of a magus and all that.</br>  <br>At least Kayneth wasn't a self destructive fool. <br><br>Matous and Tohsakas were friends for ages. It'd be like doubting your own brother. <br>Kirei always acted like a nice guy, nothing to be afraid of. <br><br>Kayneth's "problem" isn't even a common sense problem.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Precisely because of that, it was nothing better than a godsend for the Matō house to hope to have Sakura as their adopted daughter. He had obtained the way to have both his beloved daughters inherit first-class magecraft, unconstrained by their bloodline’s consequence, and carve out their own lives </br>  <br> Kayneth's "problem" isn't even a common sense problem. <br>Remember how Rin constantly drills it into your head that attacking a magus in his workshop is basicaly suicide?<br>Remember how we actualy hear of entire enforcer and executioner squads getting wiped out while attacking someone's workshop in HA?</br></br></br>  <br>It's not Bizzare that Shirou never thinks about it because he is just plain fucking stupid and autistic in every way.<br>Why don't Fate/meme stop making their cancerous battle shounen moe/ecchi/SoL comedy video game threads and just fuck off so we can discuss a good show like Fate/Zero in peace and pretend the dumb low-budget sequel never happened?</br></br>    <br>Except that Kayneth was literally convinced that he was strong enough to murder Kerry. <br>Arrogance =/= Lack of common sense.</br></br>  <br><br>The problem was that he called the Matous shameful heretics of a failing bloodline in the prologue. <br><br>Which means he either gave her over with full knowledge of the fact he irresponsibly had another daughter, and that this was a bailout arrangement for him, making him both a bad parent and a terrible human being, or he really did change his mind about them, which would just make him an incompetent parent.<br><br>Either way he isn't a stellar parent, because getting power and being forced into a role isn't a choice no matter what he spins this with. He had her without acknowledging that only one child could get the crest and gambled on her being mediocre enough in potential that she gets under the radar, making no precautions if that didn't occur.<br><br>It's death or a terrible family who could ruin your genes and make life absolutely shit for you. The thing that keeps him from the terrible human being part is him wanting what's best for them in his own way. Doesn't save him from being incompetent though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you literally arguing that Shirou isn't a dumb, autistic fuck? End your life</br>  <br>I honestly agree with Kerry's ideals. It's just there would be no way to regulate 7 billion people on the planet. Plus until technology evolved to the point machines would take over regulating humanity Kerry would still have to rely on good old fashion humans to trust to follow your ideal and not succumb to the darkness or be an idiot to fuck up the system.</br>  <br>Tokiomi's logic is entirely that of a magus. From a human perspective, he's scum. From the perspective of magi, he's doing the right thing.</br>  <br><br>They weren't friends, they were business partners. People misinterpret the non-interference pact. Just like they had with the Einzberns, it was an agreement that basically meant they kept the winner as one of the three houses, and nothing more. A treatise between noble families, not an agreement amongst friends.</br></br>  <br> Edge: the show <br> good <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It isn't even logical from a magus standpoint. He wanted to protect her from other magi using her as materials, but gave her to the first guy who claimed he wanted her as his heir, even when he knew the family was a hair's away from extinction with rotten blood, no promising heirs to train her, and their place being exceptionally low in mage society. The only thing they have to offer is their knowledge. He was expecting a four year old to revitalize a dead house.<br><br>It would be like taking your perfect specimen child and making them have a kid with a guy with every genetic defect on the book. He just didn't even bother trying to find anyone more suitable after she was born, because he was stuck on maintaining the grail being with one of the three families. It's nonsensical if you look at it objectively.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Atleast try to pretend that you've read F/Z.<br>Tokiomi thought he was doing the best thing for Sakura</br></br>  <br><br>Parents do the wrong thing with the right intentions all the time. You can love your kids but have terrible judgement based on how you were raised. Those aren't mutually exclusive.</br></br>  <br>The best thing for sakura as a magus and as a parent (who is a magus). If he was willing to abandon the path as a magus, they probably all could have lived a happy little life without any interference. That idea would obviously never cross his mind.</br>  <br> abandon the path as a magus <br>Sure, and if Kerry just decided to kill himself he wouldn't have had to worry about anything anymore either! <br>Great plan.</br></br></br>  <br>Eh no it's literaly spelled out that neither Rin nor Sakura realy have the possibility to not learn magecraft because their talent/potential is just too big.<br> Now that he thought back, for Tokiomi, this was the best gift that his father gave him as the previous head of the family. <br><br> Tōsaka Tokiomi decided to enter the way of magecraft through his own will, and decided not to be swayed by fate. <br><br> It was indeed this preparation that gave Tokiomi an iron will. What supported him through the days of merciless, strict practices ever since then was indeed this proud overconfidence of ‘this is the way of life I chose for myself’. <br><br> If only he would be able to pass the treasure that he got from his father onto his daughter – Tokiomi thought sadly. <br><br> However, that was already impossible to be achieved. <br><br> For Rin and Sakura, there were no choices for them in the first place. <br><br> One of them has all elements, having five multiple elements as her alignment. The other has no elemental alignments, having Imaginary Numbers only. Both sisters have a rare potential that can be equated to miracles. This had surpassed the limits of so-called natural talents or inborn skill; it is almost like a curse. <br><br> A magical nature would equally gather magical powers to it. Prominent people who are far outside the rules inevitably ‘gather’ equally extraordinary experiences. This can not be controlled by the person’s own will. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If he gave up his position as a Second Owner, disassociated himself from the Association, and simply went to live in the countryside so that his family could live in peace, that would be an accomplishable situation, especially in an area like Asia where the Association lacks influence.<br><br>Tokiomi is such a typical magus that he would never for a second think about giving up his path for his family because his family is a means to continue his path as a magus and his lineage's toil to reach the root.</br></br></br>  <br>Sadly he went off the wrong path. He could have been a good doctor or researcher. You can't save the world with destructive force only. I guess it couldn't be helped given what he had experienced. At least he realized at the end and was able to redeem himself.</br>  <br>see </br>  <br>True Assassin has more common sense then he does.</br>  <br>And that's with them being in the limelight of the Association, with visitors coming regularly and such. Someone like Ciel remained completely hidden despite her insane potential until Roa took over. If Tokiomi went and became a simple salaryman living in a suburb somewhere, it would reduce the likelihood of such a situation.</br>  <br><br>No, he had to adopt her out, but that was the situation after the fact of her being special at birth. He knew only one child could get a crest, and any child as strong as she was without a family's protection could be taken by the Association as material via Sealing Designation (which is dumb either way).<br><br>The imprtant part is that he didn't review proper family planning, nor bothered to take the time after she was born to make prep for that inevitability, and just called it "fate". That was his warped mentality. He loved her as his daughter but made really bad decisions.<br><br>Like Kerry did with letting the Einzberns experiment on Ilya before she was born in her mother's womb. <br><br>Good parenting is rare in the Nasuverse.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>for </br>  <br><br>Are you incapable of reading?<br>The text basicaly says that having such enormous potential draws things like Roa-possesion towards you.<br>Similiar to what Aoko said in the prologue of Tsukihime.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's too bad that despite that being the case, these special people have kids as carelessly as horny teenagers on prom night.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Why couldn't Tokiomi just let Sakura live a normal life? Just let her be a regular girl there isn't anything bad or evil about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Eh what?<br>Rin and Sakura are the "special" people.<br>Tokiomi is utterly mediocre<br>Also having more than 1 child is rather common among magi.<br>Sakura just had bad luck.<br><br> Why couldn't Tokiomi just let Sakura live a normal life?  <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's more philosophy than a hardcore rule. Due to her nature, she cannot simply be the "second useless child of a magus family meant to be married off as a bargaining chip" like Sola-Ui. So long as she is part of a magus family, she will always be at risk, whether someone happens upon her while visiting the Second Owner or someone connects the dots that "Rin = super, so sister = ?". In this hypothetical situation where Tokiomi acts as a human rather than a magus to protect his family from all suffering and abandons his path as a magus, hiding themselves away would be fairly safe. There's always the chance of a freak accident, but warding away such things would be within his ability to some extent.</br>  <br>He can't protect them from "all suffering"<br>That's impossible even for normal people and as a magus the road they have to go is full of suffering.<br>And the whole thing is that they need to be taught magecraft to defend themselves throughout their lives.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Rin and Waver are the most sane master in F/Z &amp; SN</br>  <br><br>No, Tokiomi didn't just have bad luck, he conveniently didn't know his wife's cootch spits out superbabies, even when the 500 year old mummy next door knew since the beginning. How Zouken knew and he didn't is baffling. Then again, Zouken also knew the grail was cursed and the Einzberns didn't, guess he is the only family head with a brain, unfortunately.<br><br>Even then, when you understand that your child can have such detrimental shit happen to them if they do become that special, what stops you from just stopping at one kid and being satisfied? Rin was perfect to fit bring the heir, and he got his student. He had no need for another daughter beyond just fucking his wife without thinking of the consequences.<br><br>And like another guy said, what stopped him from actually doing his work after she was born in finding a family? That can't be refuted, because not only was him cutting all ties a dubious action at best given her real family is in the same city, but there can't seriously be no takers for super kid to be their heir, that he was desperate for an adoptive family, he even had the Edelfelt family as a possibility despite their estranged history. And yet she goes to the worst proposition ever.<br><br>You can't give him the excuse of no choices. You also have to admit he made terrible judgements of both character and logic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If they were to live as normal people without using it, it would be much harder for anyone to sense. Even though he's shit, it's not like Rin or Kotomine once sensed him at all despite how often he uses it, so it's not like they can sense stuff over an entire city or anything. They would have to run into a very specific situation for anyone to realize they were special.</br>  <br>*Even though Shirou is shit</br>  <br> Even though he's shit, it's not like Rin or Kotomine once sensed him at all despite how often he uses it <br>What the fuck are you talking about?</br></br>  <br> doctor and researcher <br>he was a researcher in Miyu's universe in prisma Illya, and still fucked up in the end, and even maybe killed by shirou</br></br>  <br>I know this is bait but you can't discuss F/Z without mentioning F/SN because it's just a prequel. everything fate related is based from F/SN and you can't deny it</br>  <br><br>There's kind of a difference between using one pseudo circuit and having 27 "normal" circuits and Rin/Sakura's 1200 circuits  40 main circuits and 30 subcircuits each </br></br>  <br>What does that have to do with that post?</br>  <br>But the fact that a person can using it daily within his home and constantly within the same school building as Rin without once being suspected means it isn't particularly easy to sense at long or short ranges even with active usage. Rin and Sakura have large capacities, but if they were to never use them in an area completely devoid of any magical connections, it wouldn't bring about any suspicion unless somebody were to actively be next to them.<br><br>My original point is that from a magus standpoint, giving her away makes sense, even if the recipient is of dubious credibility, but that it isn't entirely out of the possibility that an OOC decision by Tokiomi could have let them lead normal lives.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean it's kinda stated that you can't keep people with such massive potential away from the supernatural.<br>As an example I could bring up Ciel who was never found and got Roa-ed</br></br>  <br>That's less of a rule and more of a like attracts like sentiment that often applies. It's not like Rin and Sakura just existing is going to make them supernaturally attract the supernatural, but that them being like that would make it more likely. For every Ceil that's fucked over, there should be plenty that die in obscurity. it's also a testament that Ciel lasted sixteen years without anyone finding her that it's not easy as easy as having a radar that just finds magical potential.</br>  <br>It should be noted how amazing a master Hakuno is. He/she'd be able to win a Grail war with Avenger.</br>  <br>If you were thinking of watching the anime, his death isn't even in Zero. The nigga survives Zero, then you start UBW and he's already dead for a reason they don't explain and then you have to look the shit up and come to find out that in the VN he dies in-between due to some weird "Grail affected his body shit." I was like "Whatever man I'm just rolling with it."</br>  <br> his death isn't even in Zero <br>It's the very last scene.</br></br>  <br>Shhh...he's just sleeping.</br>  <br>you realize that Shirou has sub-circuits also and all that gets counted normally is main ones, right?<br><br>Saying Rin has 1200 circuits is absurd. She has 40.</br></br></br>  <br> you realize that Shirou has sub-circuits also <br>Eh no.<br>Please point me to a single instance where it's mentioned that Shirou has subcircuits.<br><br> Pseudo-nerves within the body of a magus. <br> Magic circuits are responsible for converting life force into magical energy, and for connecting to the underlying grand sorcery formula. <br> Because the number of magic circuits a person has is fixed at birth, magi lineages do what they can to improve themselves and create an heir with even one more magic circuit. <br> Once the magic circuits have been opened for the first time, the practitioner can switch them on and off at will. <br> Each practitioner visualizes the flipping of this switch in their own particular way. For Shirou, the image is that of a gun's firing hammer, while for Rin it is stabbing a heart with a knife. <br> This image tends to be related to how the circuits were opened for the very first time, so there even those who can only open their circuits through sexual arousal or self-harm. <br> By the way, Shirou's number of magic circuits is an unexpectedly high 27. <br> Rin, on the other hand, has 40 main circuits, while her sub-circuits are 30 each. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's an idiot to a tragicomic extreme. If he had even the least bit of common sense, he could have used it to figure out his entire plan was shit even a decade before entering the Grailbowl.</br>  I never understood the shit storm about Kiritsugu. He did everything he could to obtain the grail to save the world from violence. What if you knew that when you kill 7 people the world is guaranteed peace for eternity wouldn't you do it ?<br><br> inb4 edgemaster </br></br>  Does anyone have that one picture of female Gilgamesh without a shirt staring directly at the viewer? It was in a dimly lit room.  <br>Kayneth was such a fucking idiot.<br> summon a Servant so shit the only halfway realistic way to win is to keep a low profile and engage in hit-n-run tactics while hoping Lady Luck smiles on you <br> fucking draw everyone to his position and let him show off his entire skill set <br> waste a command seal on making him attack Saber despite the situation calling for a retreat <br> after revealing everything worth knowing about your team's capabilities, turtle up in the most high-profile hotel with no plan on how to proceed or even an idea of what the enemy combatants can do, showing your hand and gaining absolutely nothing for it but still act cocky <br> walk in blind and alone into the lair of a man known as the Magus Killer and promptly get your shit pushed in <br>And so on. Every time he does anything it just makes everything worse, and just about every single time it would have been easy to see in advance that his chosen course of action was moronic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most of the shitposting about Kerry comes because of the people claiming he was a genious and the best protagonist ever being more complex and deeper than Shirou.<br><br>He wanted a childish desire imposible to accomplish and he was willling to do anything for it. He was both dumb and idealist, but that's not bad.<br>I personally like Kirigitsugu, but trying to argue with Zerofags is impossible thus the arguments against Kerry are always exagerated.</br></br></br></br>  <br>the motherfucker never realized that some things are worth trading the world for</br>  <br>Well it was idealistic desire but who knew that the "omnipotent wish granting device" would go "yeah, no that's not possible".</br>  <br>1. Enter the Holy Grail War<br>2. Win<br>3. Come before the Holy Grail<br>4. Make the Holy Grail to produce a result you cannot describe, in a way you cannot conceive, by presenting a wish you cannot put into words even after thinking about it for ten years<br>5. ????<br><br>His plan was shit from the very start. It was majorly flawed even if there wasn't the detail of the Holy Grail interpreting every wish as a command to kill all humans.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He could have saved more, but he was committed to the ideal "I'll never take a chance again after that Shirley thing. If it ever comes down to people being in danger, I'll immediately kill the smaller number of people in favor of the larger group"<br><br>Even the end of the story showed you why that logic is fucked, with the boat analogy. He killed the smallest amount of people, but because he will never take a chance he ended up killing the majority.<br><br>If he was willing to make some compromises he would have saved the majority in that situation, or if he had some people skills at least. His answer will always eliminate the smaller number though, he's not the only guy with logic in this series. No matter how innocent the smaller number and no matter how much of a non chance the death may be if he tries to save both, he won't take chances.<br><br>He'd kill every member of his family, if it meant he saved five people in the process. That's what kind of man Emiya Kiritsugu is here.<br><br>If someone was being held hostage by two people, he might just kill the hostage off the bat in order to effectively save the two people that are holding him up so they don't die in a police shoot out. As they might have to give themselves up now. Can't be helped, that was the smaller number after all. Yet with his track record they would still die as well, and we would still act like this made sense.<br><br>Hero of Justice these days feels like it goes hand in hand with "Killer who hides behind justice to exonerate himself most of the time, killing those that fall through the cracks himself in the name of altruism". Fate has mostly proven that a hero is one that kills those that get in the way for the majority in a sense. Doesn't matter who or why they were, but in the name of the majority its all it takes.<br><br>I'd take someone who just kills the bad guys, or tries to save everyone without compromise over that. Even if you failed on the second one, you tried to save everyone at least.<br><br>That's Batman</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please point to a single instance where any other magi is said to have sub circuits, especially Sakura who you've previously claimed has an equal number of circuits as Rin.<br><br><br>...oh, you can't? Because sub-circuits are never mentioned aside from a single time in any Nasuverse material and Rin is the only one who has ever had hers listed? And even then, only once to demonstrate that hers are particularly developed, implying other magi such as Shirou have a smaller number of them?<br><br>Well fuck its almost like sub-circuits should be assumed to be a regular part of any magi's circuitry that go unmentioned due to being unimportant.<br><br> B-b-b-but Rin has an amazing amount of magic power!!!! Of course she's unique and special and has sub-circuits nobody else has!!!!!! So I'm right to count them all the same as regular circuits when I say she has 1200!!! <br><br>Literally more than a years worth of her mana stored up in a Gem is equal to a single A offensive rank spell, and her maximum output is stated to be 1000.<br><br>Shirou can manage 270 before damaging his in the process.<br><br>If she actually had fucking 1200 circuits, 1160 of which are unique sub-circuits only she possesses, then her circuits would have to be an order of magnitude worse than his which makes no fucking sense since they're explicitly said to be high quality while his are trash.<br><br>The only logical conclusion based on the information we have is that sub-circuits are a vital part of any magi's circuitry and that they're not mentioned for anyone because they have no importance whatsoever to the story.<br><br>Ergo, Shirou has them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a fucking omni potent wish granting device if I had a plan how to execute my wishes I wouldn't need that shit in the first place.</br>  <br> Even the end of the story showed you why that logic is fucked, with the boat analogy. He killed the smallest amount of people, but because he will never take a chance he ended up killing the majority. <br>The boat analogy as Angra proposed it doesn't even work.<br>I mean holy fuck you don't change the thought experiment in the middle of it.</br></br></br>  <br> especially Sakura who you've previously claimed has an equal number of circuits as Rin. <br>It's directly stated in F/SN that Rin and Sakura have the same number of circuits<br> Shirou can manage 270 before damaging his in the process. <br>Where do you get that from?</br></br></br></br>  <br> It's a fucking omni potent wish granting device if I had a plan how to execute my wishes I wouldn't need that shit in the first place. <br><br><br>Its possible to formulate a plan to achieve fucking anything, but it doesn't mean its at all possible - for example, I could plan to kill a Rhino by having it be struck by lightning and slain instantly, but I can't summon the lightning.<br><br><br>Kiritsugu couldn't even conceive of the lightning. <br><br>Lighting as a concept doesn't fucking EXIST for Kiritsugu.<br><br>He wanted the rhino dead and fought in a death battle tournament in order to get the grail to kill it for him anyway, he had a dream but not the ability to even conceive of how it could be made to happen.<br><br>He charged blindly into it fueled by desperation and idealism, his plan was fucking awful.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>CCC has no power of friendship<br><br>Though it does have "Power of Origin"<br><br>Friendship alone gets you killed every time in that game.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure,but his desire was extremely childish, and his inability of realizing if it was an unsustainable ideal made him look like a manchild. An extremely well-armed, emotionally dead, willing to do anything for his wish manchild.</br>  <br> It's directly stated in F/SN that Rin and Sakura have the same number of circuits <br><br>You know what scene that was? I actually tried to find the info on her before saying that so I'm surprised there's a canon source.<br><br>Source on Shirou:<br> By the way, Shirou's number of magic circuits is an unexpectedly high 27. <br><br>And its established each can handle ten units of magical energy each before being damaged right after he opens them in F/SN for the first time properly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> holding a gun while smoking <br><br>doesn't get any more edgy that this faggot</br></br></br>  <br>I'd consider the Gilgamesh and Archer endings power of friendship and the Saber and Caster endings power of love.</br>  <br> And its established each can handle ten units of magical energy each before being damaged right after he opens them in F/SN for the first time properly. <br>Eh no.<br>pic related<br>10times the capacity != 10 magical units</br></br></br></br>  <br> You know what scene that was? I actually tried to find the info on her before saying that so I'm surprised there's a canon source. <br><br>It was the scene with the gemsword and shadow giants  I think </br></br></br>  <br> but "I want to ride your dick" love. <br><br>Main love interest is noted to be entirely chaste, and its an innocent type of high school love between two fake humans who just recently became human, so they're still pretty childish in this manner you might say.<br><br>Its the main villain that's "I want to ride your dick" instead; despite the game acknowledging that lust and sexuality is indeed part of love and isn't evil, its simply part of it, it also shows that taken to an extreme will bring you nothing but folly. Main villain took her lusts too far and ended up losing to the innocent love between two fake humans, despite proudly trying to say that her love was the only real love.<br><br>The real lost to the fake, as her love was shown to be nothing but selfish and foolish in a way, while the pseudo humans love was selfless and for each other. Even Andersen admits defeat before this sappy type of stupid love story, then he calls his master a fucking idiot for picking a fight with the one person she never had a chance of beating even if she could beat everyone else on the planet.<br><br>Fetish and sexuality are themes in the game still; the game makes sure to weave them hand in hand with an innocent sort of love, as they aren't different things, rather that's all definitely part of love. Even if they're taboo in a way, they're certainly not evil, as everyone has such things. Goes as far as to list out the fetishes of everyone in the game. Its not like Disney where it just ends on a kiss and says that's as far as anything would go, rather throughout the plot it talks about different forms of love and meaning. Some loves are shown to be warped, yet the game does not decry them as wrong entirely either, even if they are cast down as it goes along.<br><br>MC does almost mount Nero during her route though</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tamamo has nine selves, nine personas, one for each tail.<br><br>MC summoned the weakest self, the self that only relfects her ideal of serving others and loving humans, along with Tamamo being willing to take a few debuffs in order to be summoned to begin with.<br><br>If you summoned one of her more malicious selves, its noted it could get bad. Though if you summoned that she might just kill her master off the bat at worst. After all there are peronas within her like her bitterness and anger for the way she was killed.<br><br>Though her real form is one of the strongest</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> posting a picture from the gilgamesh vs shirou fight in UBW and trying to pass it off as if its from the scene i mentioned <br><br>poor form, anon<br><br><br>Cheers</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was recently confirmed that Tokiomi knew about the wormrape, but didn't care as long as it meant her magic improved.<br><br> &gt;TMF: Do Tokiomi knew what was suffered Sakura after it was adopted by the Mato? <br> U: What is important is not to Tokiomi parentage but magical progress in his family. So it is aware of having literally threw his daughter. One can imagine that Tokiomi says that through his beloved daughter, he will arrive to have higher thaumaturgic powers. <br><br>[Outside interview]<br> Tokiomi knew what was going to undergo Sakura but for him, it would allow it to become a real magician. As long as it increases the potential thaumaturgical of his family, he had no problem with Sakura treatments in Mato. However, if he had known the fate of Sakura, being a matrix for Zōken, he refused. He also thought that if things went too far, Sakura could stop herself Zōken. Unconsciously, even if he would never have said, the fight between Sakura and Rin at the end of the Heaven's Feel for him was the best thing that could happen to Tosaka. <br> By against Aoi knew nothing. <br><br>Translated from a French interview</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also confirmed that he'd fucking hate Shirou as a son in law.<br><br> TMF: One last question Fate / Zero before moving on. How would he have reacted Tokiomi learning his relationship with Rin in Unlimited Blade Works and Sakura in Heaven's Feel? [Laughs] <br> U: It is not impossible that he would have been green with rage because it would penalize her magical power quest. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I feel like there's gotta be something lost in translation here. Like Tokiomi knew she'd be filled with worms but not that it'd be done via rape instead of a surgical procedure or something.<br><br>Because holy shit he is literally the worst person in the fourth war - Kotomine included - if he knew what happened to Sakura.</br></br></br>  <br>TMF : Est-ce que Tokiomi savait ce que subissait Sakura après qu’elle a été adopté par les MATŌ ?<br>U : Ce qui est important pour Tokiomi n’est pas la filiation mais la progression magique dans sa famille. Donc il est conscient d’avoir jeté littéralement sa fille. On peut imaginer que Tokiomi se dit que, à travers sa fille chérie, il arrivera à avoir des pouvoirs thaumaturgiques supérieurs.<br><br>[Hors interview]<br>Tokiomi savait ce qu’allait subir Sakura mais pour lui, cela allait lui permettre de devenir une vraie mage. Tant que cela permet d’augmenter le potentiel thaumaturgique de sa famille, il n’avait aucun problème avec les traitements de Sakura chez les MATŌ. Cependant, s’il avait su le sort de Sakura, n’être qu’une matrice pour Zōken, il aurait refusé. Il s’imaginait aussi que si les choses allaient trop loin, Sakura pourrait d’elle-même stopper Zōken. Inconsciemment, même s’il ne l’aurait jamais dit, le combat entre Sakura et Rin à la fin d’Heaven’s Feel était pour lui la meilleure chose qui puisse arriver aux TŌSAKA.<br>Aoi par contre ne savait rien.<br>[/Hors interview]<br><br>TMF : Est-ce que Gil a un Gate of Babylon dans son Gate of Babylon ? Est-ce que ça fait une récurrence infini ?<br>U : Non, mais d’autres puissances peuvent peut-être s’en dégager, parce qu’à la base, c’était une arme qui était freiné. Mais le mieux, ça serait de poser la question directement à Nasu.<br>TMF : Mais il n’est pas là…</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not omnipotent. It's just very potent. He knows the principle behind how it works, because he knows the war is a ritual to aggregate mana into the Lesser Grail, and if he had any questions he could just consult the people who originally designed it, since he's been living with them for the last decade.<br><br>However, the problem wasn't whether or not it had the power, the problem was his wish, which really just amounted to a vaguely defined desire for the world to be a nice place. He couldn't say what he wanted and he couldn't say how he wanted it. Maybe the Grail would have been more helpful if it wasn't tainted by concentrated evil, but he still would have relied on an unknown variable to formulate his wish for him, to do something unknown, to remake the world into something unknown. It's just a bunch of question marks as soon as he reaches the Holy Grail. And he had at least a decade to think this part through.</br></br></br>  <br>I think you're right.<br><br>"However, if he had known the fate of Sakura, being a matrix for Zōken, he refused" sounds a lot like it means he didn't know she'd be filled with the worms since half the point of them was to put one next to her heart to function as her main body and the other reason was to prepare her as a grail vessel, which may be the 'matrix' shit it mentions.</br></br></br>  <br> Cependant, s’il avait su le sort de Sakura, n’être qu’une matrice pour Zōken, il aurait refusé. <br><br>Yeah, translation provided above for this line seems accurate based on what I recall of high school French.<br><br>I think this anon has a point here possibly also<br>  <br><br>Without knowing the original Japanese response I can't really say what he meant by the 'matrix' line since I don't recall that exact phrasing being used before. <br><br>It could refer to her being raped by the worms until they were a part of her instead of them being passed on via surgery, or just the part of him using her as a vessel for himself/the grail.<br><br>Either way he's still a fucking cunt for sending her to a household he knew was gonna fill her with worms one way or another just so she'd know some magic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No, that's just saying if he knew she was just breeding stock, he would have refused.<br><br>He didn't care about the rape if it meant her potential increased, but he cared if she was just a means to an end to raise up someone else, y'know.<br><br>Tokiomi wanted it to be his own loin fruit that reached the end or fought against each other. Not for her to be used to give birth to someone else who would be power in a sense. It was something like that.<br><br>I can probably find original anon's summary<br><br>Original anon that translated a summary of it confirmed that much; the one I posted is just the google translate version to make it easier for people. Since it seemed like the Google translate got it close enough to be readable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> For the fate stuff, the most interesting parts is that Tokiomi knew the kind of treatment Sakura got, but he didn't give a shit, although he would have refused to give Sakura away if he knew Zouken was just using her as a womb and he was betting on Sakura stopping Zouken if things went too far. Also the Sakura Vs Rin is the best thing to ever happen to the Tohsaka family. <br> There is no gate of bayblon inside the gate of babylon. <br> Kiri views Taiga as a sister, but she's in love with him. <br> He didn't answer whether Waver will join Ionioi Hetairoi after he dies, it's a question of Waver's immortality he says. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Cheers then for the clarification</br>  <br><br>Give me a source</br></br>  <br>http://www.studio-shaft.fr/intervie<wbr>w-de-gen-urobuchi-a-lepitanime-2013<wbr>/</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>http://www.studio-shaft.fr/intervie<wbr>w-de-gen-urobuchi-a-lepitanime-2013<wbr>/</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it references her becoming a spare body for Zouken and being remade into a bootleg Grail vessel instead of being brought up as a magus. That she was treated as a system he could fiddle around with instead of as a pupil.</br>  <br> and he was betting on Sakura stopping Zouken if things went too far. <br><br>Its a realization in itself how stupid Tokiomi is if this counted as a plan.<br><br>She was an eight year old with no magic or understand of spells other than what Zouken himself taught her, he was a hundreds of years old vampire type being with plenty of magic and intelligence when it comes to surviving, and the first time he uses you for "training" you can no longer turn against him at all or else you're liable to be eaten alive from the inside out. He can kill you with a thought by the time you've reached the area of "Hey, I don't know about this sort of thing". Even if he doesn't have his familiars inside of you yet, I'm pretty sure he could overpower an eight year old and throw her in the pit pretty easily. No matter what she loses in that situation pretty easily.<br><br>She had no magic or power, and he expected her to somehow do something here as a powerless eight year old against this wormpire?<br><br>He's stupid<br><br>Teach her some magic first if you want this to actually be a plan, but for now that's just fucking stupid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If this is from 2013 how comes that it has never been mentioned here or at BL?</br>  <br>Zouken at this point is patheticaly weak and uses nearly all of his magical energy to keep himself alive.</br>  <br>Even Rin couldn't kill him when she was trying, despite her getting the chance to fight him twice.<br><br>When it comes to survival, he's an existence that surpasses servants as a roach. He can beat up or capture an eight year old just fine.<br><br>Guy almost killed Shirou pretty easily in the story as well. Even without a servant for either of them, Shirou was right about to die and he knew it. He was able to surprise Zouken by almost summoning Saber, which created a slight stall effect despite it not working, and then Rider bailed his ass out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See this is yet another reason I think that this guy  may be onto something<br><br>It really does sound like he only knew she'd be treated like shit and have worms shoved in her, not that she'd be raped by them in the process, made essentially a slave, and used solely to carry Zouken's main body worm/prepped for breeding/turned into a grail vessel.<br><br><br>There's a lot of interviews even with Nasu that have never been translated or even found by the Western community due to them being in disparate magazines and various fansites only, I can believe one minor French one with Uro slipped through the cracks.<br><br>But yeah, it does seem somewhat suspicious.<br><br><br>But if Tokiomi actually knew what he was doing to Sakura he still should have known there'd be no way for her to EVER fight back, unless he was just so arrogant he assumed she'd come up with something even he couldn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> See this is yet another reason <br><br>I'd just say Tokiomi really is that stupid<br><br>He has that kind of track record here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess I just really wanna believe that even he couldn't be that much of a callous, arrogant, massive retard.</br>  <br>But given certain circumstances you can only save one, or none. When both isn't a option, it's clear that you have to make a choice or just lose everything all together. There's is no "try to save everyone", that's the same as trying to pick both when it isn't possible. You can only hope for a miracle or take action.</br>  <br> over 7 billion people in the world  <br> your evil for thinning the herd <br><br>Anon pls</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey there Grail-kun</br>  <br>Fuck off, Gil.</br>  <br>I tend not to have too much faith in the guy. He has this sort of luck where he caused basically every problem in F/SN. Giving his daughter away leading to HF, summoning Gilgamesh leading to humanity almost dying, having Kotomine as his student and causing him to be corrupted, giving Zouken power by honoring that old thing they had between families when he would have basically passed with no harm if he hadn't given him such an ace since it was noted Zouken was plum fuck out of options before that point and he wasn't going to get a magus potential child out of nowhere except in this sort of situation, etc.<br><br>Not to mention in the two worlds we've seen where Tokiomi was still alive when Rin and Sakura were still around later on in life, they're a bit fed up with the guy. At best he's that embarrassing sort of father, and at worst they really tend to avoid him. Even if those are a bit jokeish scenarios.<br><br>Non joke scenarios though its noted if he was alive when Rin reached adulthood she really wouldn't be happy. She would have either abandoned magushood entirely and run away from home, or become a cold witch dead on the inside.<br><br>He's a guy that tended to fuck up things, and had a coldness about him that few fans tended to get, even if he still had fatherly feelings.<br><br> In the eyes of young Rin, her father Tokiomi was a great magus who must be respected and loved, but as for the coldheartedness that accompanied the ideal, that was a negative aspect of his personality that she failed to understand. <br> If Tokiomi had survived until the time when Rin could have really understood her father’s personality, it would certainly have deeply affected the development of her own personality. Whether she would oppose that inhumanity and leave the path of thaumaturgy, or whether she would become a “perfect and coldhearted” witch like her father – no matter which one, this parallel world, for Rin, would certainly be one far away from happiness. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There's is no "try to save everyone" <br><br>Batman would pick that choice, he'd find a way.<br><br>A good version of Shirou would also pick that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes but there's also a quote by the Butcher that Rin got her kindness from Tokiomi can't quote because I'm on mobile</br>  <br>Its this coldness and inhumanity people tend not to get, thinking he must really not be good. For him the ideals of a magus are above everything.<br><br>Part of him in this logic would say Sakura would be glad to be raped a lot if it meant she had a chance to be a real magus, to have a chance to reach the root and earn glory for all magi ever.<br><br>He thinks with the glory of mages ideal above all else, his humanity or family self is a very distant second.<br><br>For him, the most unhappy thing for his daughter would be to not live as a magus if she had the potential. To have such potential and let it go to waste, she'd be miserable, she'd much more go through some shit and be able to use it instead. If she almost died a thousand times or was tortured in order to become a magus, he thought she might prefer that due to his inhumanity.<br><br>After all being a magus is the ultimate glory, and to try to reach the root is the only thing we should strive for.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Takeuchi: He was a character whose image changed 180 degrees from what I hat thought in the early stages. However, now he has become a character who can't be pictured any other way <br> Urobuchi: Since Rin inherited her kindness from her father, I was given some hesitation about killing off his character, and so I ventured to put him in the position of the bad guy. However, by personal standard, he's a traditional person without a single thing wrong about him. <br><br><br>I think he means she originally inherited it from him, so he made him more of a prick so it'd be easier to have him killed off the way he did - but he was still the perfect example of a traditional magi even then.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's sort of right in that after all the shit she's been through, she still likes the practice of magic. If she had been brought up in the mindset of reaching the root, she'd probably be more typical.</br>  <br><br> you can't thin the herd and make life better for everyone  <br><br>Anon pls</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;summon a Servant so shit the only halfway realistic way to win is to keep a low profile and engage in hit-n-run tactics while hoping Lady Luck smiles on you <br>He isn't shit though.

It's pathetic.<br>No doubt Deutsche Post is a factor in it, but I feel like customs also regressed on their competence.<br>I'm with you 100%.<br><br>And what do we have?<br>No recourse at all.<br><br>I honestly rather pay all taxes properly and have things worked out swiftly, but I have no control over it at all.<br>And I don't want to piss the bed every night out of fear my packages are gone, which admittedly has yet to happen, but I once waited 2 full month before tracking updated after I told them to investigate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why doesn't he just wait for more figures of those skanks?</br>  I'd panpaka her pans if you know what I mean.  <br>A bit, but if anything they should be darker.</br>  <br> lumpy bellies </br>  <br>When I saw Shin Megami Tensei on the list I got really excited for the millisecond it took me to read Persona 3 after it. Then I got double disappointed when it was not one of the girls.</br>  Alter's version looks so much worse actually.  <br>OC. Her name is Tatami.</br>  <br>Still not as bad as this abomination.</br>  <br>Much appreciated.</br>  <br>IS THERE A BIGGER PIC OF HER FIGURE?!? I NEED THIS</br>  <br>Isn't that the artist's name?</br>  Speaking of proxies. Does goody japan undervalue? <br><br><br>It is the artist name.</br></br></br>  <br>That is seriously bad, what the fuck were they thinking.</br>  hasn't this been in the pipeline for more than a year now?  <br>Would be more than ironic to name her tatami anyway</br>  <br> mfw GMILFs </br>  <br> nothing of interest to me <br> now nothing stops me from getting off the slope <br>At last I'm free</br></br></br>    <br>No</br>  <br>Big enough?</br>  <br>Well technically I want ritsu and the other keions, but I already knew I was getting them.</br>  Well, this Wonfes sure was different for me. Aside from the regular "tons of shit and a bunch of nice figures I'll never buy" there was something that got me hyped (fucking shinkis fuck yeah) and something that got me mad (toysworks dropping the soft breast senrans before they got to Yagyuu).  <br>Yeah yeah sure right uh huh mmmm hmmmmmm~</br>  <br><br>Really wish there was more stuff of her, or the Abyssals for that matter.</br></br>  <br>Like you don't have a giant backlog.<br><br>Or do you not?<br>How would you explain it? You're very oldfag? Rich? Ignorant?</br></br></br></br>  I like the P4D Rise and the new Homu, other than that, not much spotted. None of the Mikus have good enough butts.  <br>They're slowly getting more and more stuff. There was that Hoppou nendo that went up a few days ago. I really want a good battleship hime figure though.</br>    Why isn't kancercolle relegated to /jp/?  Auf Japan ist immer Verlass.  <br>No Hoshijiro, BeniJiro and/or Benisuzume Mk II. Only another EnaJiro.</br>  <br>bumpy stomach doesnt bother me</br>    is there a better pic of this location so text is readable? That Justice looks amazing  Which billy color is better, black or white?<br><br><br>This was the first wonfes that didn't have any gks I cared about, or the characters I like that had one were really subpar looking.</br></br></br>  <br>I do have more money than free time so yeah, the only backlog I have is anime/manga one.</br>  <br>Jazz hands.</br>  <br><br><br>They're coming. People really like their designs. I ordered that sexy wo class about a week ago and of course i have the re class preordered as well. Abyssals are the best!</br></br></br>  Welp. I had a few honest surprises and I also drowned in boats and swords. Not too bad. <br><br>Im looking at Alter's Leo, Kusuriuri and a sonico.</br></br>  <br>It had an anime adaptation.</br>  <br>Enviable.</br>  <br>Even Touhou has some OVAs</br>  <br> What is your disappointment <br>This single handedly removed any and all disappointment I may have had.</br></br>  <br>No Show By Rock.</br>  must be for boat gang members  <br>I must own him.</br>    <br>Yeah, but Touhou  was  huge and hijacked the whole board at times. Those OVAs are also not official.</br>  Im so glad they finally painted these. Insta pre order.  <br>It looks like a pillow case?<br>Who'd sit on a piece of art like that.<br>It must be something else.<br>Goku shirt?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lack of Max Factory's Link.</br>    <br>Not a single Blazblue figure.</br>  <br><br>Alrighty then.</br></br>  <br>Izayoi and Nu never</br>  <br> Re-class <br>Ma nigga</br></br>  <br>varsity-style jackets</br>  <br>Fucking this. All I wanted was Cyan or Moa.</br>  I wonder if this would trigger our /k/omrades.  <br>That is an awesome pic anon.</br>  <br>I guess you'll have to get the GK they've been selling and lrn2paint.</br>  <br>Honestly the only announcement I care about. It was a pretty weak WonFes overall.</br>  Which boatslut is this?  <br> dem legs <br>Just... why.</br></br>  <br>dem cankles tho</br>  <br>fuck off</br>  <br> All that detail <br><br>She actually looks good compared to the other Boat scales.</br></br></br>  These look really good too. Can anyone identify who they are?  <br>Tony Taka shit</br>  <br>They look like slutty balerinas. Which is bang up my alley.</br>  <br>The shota rapist.</br>  <br><br>They NEED to make one</br></br>    <br>Pan-pa-ka-paaan!</br>  <br><br>Pretty sure I saw a Terumi pic floating around.</br></br>  <br>They don't really look slutty by ballerina standards.<br>Their pose is also super simple for ballerinas.<br>If ballerinas can do one thing well it's pose.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a GK and also really bad</br>  <br>Does it come with a piss puddle?</br>  <br>I'd fuck it if it has some kind of opening for that.</br>  <br><br>Aquatic serpents need fins. Did you expect her to walk on land?</br></br>  My Maki is sitting at the post office waiting for me to get paid so I can pay the customs fee   Still no Takao sculpt     <br>Almost 6 years.</br>    <br><br>Man do I hate the official art for those two</br></br>  <br>No, you have to piss on it yourself and then add stabilizers to the piss to make it stay. <br><br><br>Use a knife and make your own opening.</br></br></br></br>    <br>this wasn't made into PVC</br>  <br>but she only loves shotas not lolis how will you seduce her?</br>  <br>I'm not abusive like that. I have my partners well being in mind as well.<br> also my dicks <br>So her mouth is out of the picture.<br><br><br>If they keep this up I think we might be able to sue them at the ICC for crimes against humanity.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck everything</br>  <br>I didn't even realise Takao was cute until the anime came out. Nobody needs Kai Ni more than these two to get better art.</br>  <br>Didn't like this?</br>  <br>No good boats.</br>  <br>Waifu's new figs look like shit. <br>Her face is mine.</br></br>  <br>There was another picture that had the stand with their names on it, Odette and Odile. <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_<wbr>Lake</wbr></br></br>  <br><br>we still have hope that if S2 sells well it could motivate them into making it <br><br>but anon two of the best boats got scales</br></br></br></br>  <br>I was fucking waiting for this, good shit</br>  <br>Anime really slimmed down Takao in all the right places</br>  <br>I'mma need that. Hope they don't fuck up the paint job.</br>   granblue figurines. <br> None of her. <br><br>Seriously, them handle bars need figurine.</br></br></br>  <br>Here's hoping that Koto does a good job with paint and QC.</br>  <br>Yeah, there's that, but that's normal Benisuzume. Most of all I really want a figure of Hoshijiro in her uniform or pilot suit.</br>  <br>kill me now</br>  <br>yeah the official art for them sucks so hard compared to all the other boats its a real shame since they're one of the better pairs<br><br>Don't forget how they ampled up Atago</br></br></br>  Cannot wait to own these delicious tights.  <br>What a disappointing crotch.</br>  <br>Didn't care too much for her, Takao's thighs stole me every scene she showed up</br>  <br>understandable she was already my favorite before the show came out so i really focused on her</br>  <br>Oh yeah, that would be pretty sweet.<br><br>It would also be nice if Sidonia figma didn't cost so fucking much.</br></br></br>  <br> implying <br> motherfucking timpopo-chang </br></br>  This one looks amazing, and classy.  <br>I thought I saw a Moa garage kit... but it was shit.</br>  <br>And is a GK</br>  <br>When was the last time they fucked up considering their price segment?</br>  <br>Yeah, there's one Moa GK. <br>http://www.e2046.com/product/23370<br><br>I think it looks nice for amateur stuff.</br></br></br></br>  How many figures do you have to own in order to be considered hardcore otaku?  <br>Mostly disappointed that all sword scales so far are just boring standing poses. Also no Syaoran anything.<br><br>There were some nice surprises though, so it wasn't a total bust.</br></br></br>  <br>1</br>  <br>I see why people who know who this is are excited, but where the hell is he from?</br>  <br>69 dude</br>  <br>Lots of people had issues with Shiro.<br>Ciel doesn't look great.<br>Kurumi looks a little bland, but I might be biased since their version doesn't appeal to me.<br>Minerva's colours look flat.<br>Syaoran has a horrible paint job.<br>Sakura has issues with broken pieces.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  They're showing how to dress up your GUP figma tank on the GSC broadcast.<br><br>You missed most of it though,</br></br>  Preorder in the upcoming weeks right?  <br>First result on google.</br>  <br>Kusuriuri was way out of left field, same with alter leo. <br><br>A very nice anime made by madhouse. One of my top ten all time, for sure. Think mushishi but more flamboyant.</br></br></br>  <br>Mononoke</br>  <br>damn so many people want that Rui scale</br>  <br><br>I hope so. I love Taihou.</br></br>  <br>Shit. Although what did I expect with the amount of figures they do. I'm super satisfied with all I have.</br>  <br>145 for I love anime</br>  <br>Max is doing a shit job.<br><br>Don't follow that example.</br></br></br>  <br>The Ciel scale with the really awkward looking gloss on the horse</br>  <br>What's the top left one in the maybe from?</br>  <br>Does she come with a gas tank?</br>  <br>People had issues with Sakura and Syaoran? Mine were perfect. I guess I just got lucky again, my Shiro was fine too.</br>  <br>Who is making it?</br>  <br>Aquamarine.</br>  <br>GSC</br>  <br>Aquamarine.</br>    <br>thanks</br>  My wallet is so god damned relieved now.  <br>Is this the microfiber one? I wish there's a mofu mofu one. That one feels way better than microfiber.</br>  How is there still 50k viewers on the GSC broadcast at 3am on a Monday.  <br>That's how children look. Not that I know or anything.</br>  Figma King of Get.<br>So, when will Dark Magician Girl figma get reveal?</br>  should we expect China?  <br>My Shiro's also great</br>  Did anyone see Gwendolyn and Mercedes at wonderfest?  <br> feels way better than microfiber <br>You must confuse microfiber with something else.</br></br>  Preorder when?  <br>I'm getting confused with all those Seibas. Why does this one wear that stuff?</br>  <br>Can't wait for my 5th Castko figure.</br>  <br>Pretty sure niconamas show the amount of people that turned the stream on, the number doesn't go down when people are leaving,</br>  <br>Most  fuckable  Caster ever.</br>  <br>Never thought I will ever consider buying a Saber, but this is really tempting me.</br>  Any idea where I can get this one the cheapest?  <br>My Shiro is okay, but people have been reporting broken wings on Sakura since her release.<br><br>My biggest issue with Syaoran is pic related. The gold/orange trim is very clearly off center—you can even see the sculpted lines for it and how the paint doesn't match up to them, and the circle doesn't meet the edges like it should. I haven't seen a single picture yet where this part looks like it did in the prototype. The sleeves have the same issue, though it's not usually as glaringly obvious.</br></br></br>  <br>Concept art getting milked.<br><br>Majin Saber next...</br></br></br>  <br>I wish her thighs were skinnier. Still an instant preorder</br>  <br>There's no way that's true as the stream hit 80k</br>  <br>Oboro Muramasa.</br>  Make this thread staahhppp  <br>Okay, I thought so! Thanks</br>  <br>You sure that was not the day stream?<br>Well, I'm not really sure anyway, sorry if I'm wrong.</br></br>  <br> Wanting those thighs skinnier <br>Nothing wrong with some juicy thighs anon, and I'm not even one of those asinine healthfags</br></br>  <br>She already got dat gap. Any more slender is anorexia zone.</br>  <br>I like them hips bigger tho. Childbearing hips.<br><br>Can't wait for one-punch shenanigans, both figma and nendo.</br></br></br>  <br>Ah, I just checked mine and it has the same problem. It's not super noticeable from normal viewing distance in the cabinet. No problem with Sakura's wings at least.</br>  <br>There is when the character normally has very thin thighs. Plenty of other figures out there if you want juicy thighs.</br>  <br>regarding figures, you should not watch for the cheapest but if the seller cat be trusted.<br><br>You are a bit late to get her "cheap"<br><br>And also: just as obligatory: read the guide - there are some trustworthy shops that sells you nearly all your heart needs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hopefully soon.</br>  <br>All the boatshit, planeshit, idolshit, mikushit, and swordshit keeps getting figures while actual good things dont.</br>  <br><br> the thighs are already kinda boringly average <br> wanting them even smaller <br><br>Get sprung. Wada can't draw for shit, if you're looking for art appropriate figs you'd end up with nosales.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Official art and her game model shows some inviting thighs though</br>  <br>I used to say the same, but I can't possibly pass off on that. The whole outfit is so well designed. <br>Just let go.</br></br>  Those thighs aren't juicy you plebs, they're already as skinny as it gets without being that creepy Miku.<br><br><br>More like broken thighs</br></br></br>  <br>You're not getting that cheap regardless.</br>  <br>Yeah I regret choosing that picture, the Takeuchi one I had too big filesize</br>  <br>Even cheapest will probably be more than the RRP.</br>  <br>Don't burst his bubble, the newfag probably thinks he can buy it for $20.</br>  <br>She's kneeling there genius, of course they look bigger there.</br>  <br> I'm a hipster the post </br>  What stops me from making a new account if amiami closes my current account?  <br><br>My only disappointment would be that GSC didn't announce a Kaga and Z-3 scale too.</br></br>  <br>they maybe ban your adress? try it and tell us the result.</br>  <br>Average size nonetheless, I think the figure is fine</br>  <br>IP and Physical Address I would imagine</br>  <br> exclusively boats, Mikus, idols and fuccbois <br><br>Holy shit.</br></br></br>  <br>You can make as many account as you want, but if they truly care about banning you they will notice.</br>  <br>Are Saber and Sorceress idols or fuccbois?</br>  Does anyone know of a Twitter that has everything shown at wonderfest ?  <br>Both.</br>  <br>Saber is a fuccboi. Sorceress is okay.</br>  <br><br>Some stuff is missing from the pic, but I'm too lazy to edit it again, like Phat!'s Angela, Some Native ones, Alter Yuzuruha and Velvet, etc.</br></br>  <br>figure for best caster when?</br>  <br>Looks mechanically sound. All that weight on the end would make it a fucking bitch to shoot though, on the flip side it'd soak up recoil, although fuddy five's already nice and smooth.<br><br>My biggest problem is the fact that the window buster is angled, and it has those spikes. Defeats the whole purpose.</br></br></br>  <br>Pay someone to build and paint that garage kit for you.</br>  <br><br>No one likes witches.</br></br>  <br>Can't decide between this and the other.<br><br><br>I wouldn't say its THAT much worse, but I agree, some things are off. What a shame.<br><br><br>I like how her face turned out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>she is literally the least popular servant from the fifth holy grail war bar true ass.</br>  <br>I wish. Fuck nips ad their Saiba wanking. boatfags get plenty of boatsluts, swordfujos get lots of sworldshit, fatefags get saber 97% of the times.</br>  <br>Fucking same.</br>  <br>I feel ashamed to live in the same country as this faggot.</br>  <br> Saberfags </br>  Should I keep both or if not which should I sell? I had no idea I had both of them.  <br>I'm aware that I won't get her "cheap", but there is a cheapest one out there. I'm not sure where to look for sold out ones.</br>  <br>Where do you live mate?</br>  <br>Ya missed the window. I have mine still in box if things get finacially rough for me I might sell her.</br>  <br>The states in the deep south.</br>  <br>Hot plate one.</br>  Probably not going to get Racing Miku, but ill probably get Starry Miku.  <br>I've got one boxed that I've been keeping in case they never sold a Jibril.  Sorry. </br>  <br>They're from the 2014 calendar, December I think.</br>  <br>Guessing that's the one on the right. Also anyone want to buy this slut?</br>  <br>How much did you pay back then?</br>  <br>hhnnng <br>how much</br></br>  <br>Sell right, keep left.</br>  <br> friedkun@gmail.com  She's never been opened.</br>  <br>Amiami's price, 9720￥</br>  <br>Jelly as fuck :(</br>  <br>how many times have you glued her?</br>  <br>Where are you based?</br>  <br>When I did glue it was only opened figs, since she's sealed I'm not going to cum on her fucking box.</br>  <br>Keep Alter's. How the fuck do you forget about what you ordered?</br>  <br> :( <br>Really now?</br></br>  <br> when you spend as much as I did you kinda forget sometimes. Every order was around 1-2k usd so the boxes were fuckhuge. </br>  Enjoy the twenty-sixth of July.  <br>I need this in my life and I'm never going to get it.<br><br>Why live?</br></br></br>  <br>Austria.</br>  <br>Is there any actual satisfaction in gluing a fig?</br>  <br>Brazil is illegal.<br>Bullshit, its gray area. Unless they want fill the quota importing is fine.</br></br>  <br><br><br>You said they kept her leotard but those look like normal panties to me. I can see skin above them.</br></br></br>  <br>2spooky. Thanks doc.</br>  <br>spooky</br>  <br>Possible I won't get anything. I didn't not get excited.</br>  45,500yen  <br> Depends, for me there was nothing until I saw the end result.  </br>  <br>Daily dose</br>  <br>Are you trying to make me sad for not having a Yotsuba calendar ?<br><br>You are, aren't you ?</br></br></br>  <br>WHY?</br>  <br>They're high-cut anon leotards</br>  <br>So much for a shitty recolor.</br>  Waiting for paint.<br><br>I dont want to kill my wallet and get both Alter and Pirate Sento. She's too perfect.<br><br>I'm glad I waited for Sento instead of ordering Koto's.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you even enjoy it at this point or are you simply trying to feed your addiction? Because you didn't even open and display them. What's the point?</br>  you will order left or right?  <br>That's kinda gross.<br>That said, I like my normal one.</br></br>  <br> I'm about to sell all of my real estate and buy a beach house down by the gulf and open about 4 stores so I kinda don't want to haul them all 14 hours away. It's easy to sell the ones I absolutely cannot live without. </br>  <br>You can't just order one, you need both. Unfortunately the tongue on Kuro is going to look like shit.</br>  <br>Both is the only answer.</br>  <br>Oh,  fried ?<br><br>Good luck with that.</br></br></br>  <br>Idols, boats, and swords took too many of the companies slots, it feels like barely anything was announced. It's also pretty sad that the only thing I know I'm getting is western shit.</br>  <br> Thanks, huge endeavor but will be great to live my dream so early in life. </br>  <br>I don't order figures because of a single great feature.<br>They have to be near flawless allaround.<br>So likely none, but I'm willing to wait until they have painted prototypes.<br><br>Naturally both is the only applicable answer.<br>You get either none or both.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I'd order Illya, but I'm a Bong, so no chance.</br>    <br>Excuse me?</br>  <br>How does this shit girl from a shit series get so many figures but other Kyoani shows get nothing? Where's my Kumiko?</br>  <br><br>I bought Hajime. You'll be fine, they never open anything. You know what this countries like, the police are too busy catching real pedos while trying not to appear racist to care about you.</br></br>  <br>Fucked up word placement.<br><br>They resemble high-cut leotards instead of the traditional panties. GSC seems to be following the ref you posted instead of these</br></br></br>  <br> Sento and Amagi <br> shit <br><br>Shit taste man. I'm waiting for the eventual Alter Muse.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oppai</br>  <br>omg<br><br>There's like 7 other auctions for this same recolor<br><br>I want it since it honestly looks a bit better but<br><br>That's just too much man.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>S-She's not just boobs. She has a winning personality.</br>  <br>None - the bras aren't cast-off.</br>  <br><br><br>Only 300 in the world, still those prices are stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>And BOOBS.</br>  <br>Got her for 40k. I was actually bringing that auction to 45k.</br>  <br>Someone other than Kanye had personality?</br>  <br>Show was retarded and mindless ecchi. Worst Kyoani show in years, worse than Chuu22. If you want tits get actual lewd figures.</br>  <br>you're beyond help, I got mine for 32K.</br>  <br>Didn't feel like there was much new stuff shown, let alone any surprises, but i was mostly hoping on some updates on stuff i want from last wonfes and only two were there.</br>  <br>I'm fine with that.</br>  <br>Ohhh, okay. Had a slow moment.</br>  <br>45K = 4 nice scales, are you rich?<br><br><br>You're an idiot too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've never had a package opened by Bongland customs, so it'll probably be fine.</br>  <br>Yeah, same here.<br>Still, I'm sure she's wearing the leotard, it's sexy as fuck and I really hope I'm not wrong</br></br>  Seriously, the base Selvaria is 9k.<br><br>Are you just stupid to buy a recolor 30k more than the base figure ? I thought /a/ was actually clever with the " Elitist " status we give ourselves, but you are proving me wrong there.<br><br> Of course not all buyfag are like that... right ? </br></br></br></br>  <br>Aren't the recolored version bigger in scale?</br>  <br>Only time i ever had something opened was two artbooks by DHL, fuckers just ripped the packets top of so the books could slide out.</br>  <br>Oh you got the buy-it-now auction then? I noticed it had ended<br><br><br>I didn't see the auction that ended for 32k. Was it somewhere other than YAJ! or did I just overlook it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>But muh exclusive.</br>  <br> stop buying things I don't like! <br>It's a limited recolor of a popular figure of a popular character. If you can't see why many people would want it, I don't know what to say.</br></br>  <br>Nope, I thought based on the first photo I saw, but it appears that it's the same scale than the base.</br>  <br>No, but i have no patience for maybe finding her for a more reasonable price. I don't mind shilling out that much money if i really want something.</br>  <br>Selvaria is my Waifu, I already have three of the regular ver, also I paid only 32K, not 45K.</br>  slime girl figure when  <br>I think that was just an odd perspective in the picture, plus the recolor was on a riser.<br><br><br>It's limited to 300 total, and it's a popular character with a color scheme that's pleasing to the eye. Of course she'd end up expensive.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm waiting for better pictures until I make a final decision. Might be the only decent "Sakura" figure for a while (or ever).</br>  Does anyone know if they're legit?<br>http://www.ebay.at/itm/Kotobukiya-N<wbr>o-Game-No-Life-Shiro-1-7-Complete-P<wbr>VC-Figure-FM2142-/181433770782?pt=L<wbr>H_DefaultDomain_71&amp;hash=item2a3e4ba<wbr>31e</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Yeah i was the one who got the buy it now auction.</br>  <br>Buy a cup of jello and draw a smiley face on it and you got yourself a slime girl figure</br>  <br>I can see why. I just don't see why they are OK with buying at this price. You know that if no one buy them at this price, they will drop, right ?<br><br>And I love Selvaria too, I prefer black over white so that's not a real problem, but fuck, even for a limited figure I wouldn't buy it at this price for a recolor.<br><br>Maybe I have too much hope that people get actually smart about how economics work.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't wait to see some pics of obese neckbeards in these.</br>  <br>DRR DRR DRR</br>  <br><br>I prefer her RAH honestly, looks pretty nice, and you know, it's actually Sakura and not that "thing".</br></br>  <br>Hey now, that image isn't fair;<br><br>They lowered her to 30k and someone bought her.</br></br></br>  <br>There were many auctions at YAJ, at first I felt bad for paying that much, but now I know I got a good deal, I wish I could get a second one, but they're too damn expensive.</br>  <br>Even if no one in these threads bought the recolor, there's still all the fans in Japan who would. I doubt the price drop would be steep or quick.</br>  <br>I've been waiting for a year and I'm sold already, I can't wait for it. She's my favorite TM</br>  <br> Artikelstandort: CN, China <br><br>Never buy anything from China. They're the bootleg capitol.</br></br></br>  Why must it always be Selvaria? I'd kill for a good Alicia or Largo figure.  <br><br> odd perspective in the picture <br><br>Well, damn. Thanks for clearing that up.<br><br>Shinki finally return, all the joy.<br> Plamo <br><br>Errr, ALL THE JOY. Kinda surprised Konami let them buy up the license.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So are there any figures Dengeki missed in their report or is that it?  <br>Highly unlikely that her price drops under 30K in any case.</br>  Do you think she's worth it? Usually I'm kind of wary of open mouthed figures. I find they tend to look awkward. But this one looks really cute.  <br>Not everyone is as poor as you</br>  <br>pls put her skirt back on</br>  <br>Thought so, I checked pretty much all the stores on the guide. I guess I'll get the one from playmoya</br>  Is it better to combine items shipped from AmiAmi? I have 3 pre-orders, one in August, September, and October.  So with Nana being next, it seems MF will start going into best girls after Nana. Started with worst girls to better. So Yami should be last.  <br>dont buy it. pictures are official ones, the price is fishy as hell and it's from China. 99% bootleg</br>  <br><br>Koto is getting a monopoly on the robot girl market now.</br></br>  <br>Possible figure of the year.</br>  <br>It won't end with that one, anon.<br><br>That said, yes you should.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't mind going insane. My rarest figure cost me 700€.<br><br>But it was something sold at very few exemplary, that was the based figure ( Not a recolor, again that's fucking important there ), and very old.</br></br></br>  <br>If you like Kotori, yes. It's good.<br><br>Thank God I dont like Love Live or my wallet would be dead.</br></br></br>  <br>sorry, pic<br><br> that one fag who posted this first and said it was Yami and I got disappointed. </br></br></br>  <br>So what is the difference here? This was limited to 300 pieces and looking at the auctions there are more than a few willing to pay a high price. Not that scalping doesn't suck but can't be helped for a limited exclusive</br>  <br>32K isn't really that much, it's the price of two very nice scales.</br>  <br>Plamoya is super overpriced most of the time. If you want her at a resonable price, make an account on figinstock and have it check on Mandarake and amiami preowned. It might take a while to show up, but you'll save a lot of money once/if it does.</br>  <br>This turned the Wonfes from complete gutter shit to OK.</br>  <br>36k. They tend to reuse listings though so I'm not sure it's the exact same one.<br><br>I do remember someone in these threads bought her for 50k.</br></br></br>  <br><br>  Thank God I dont like Love Live or my wallet would be dead. <br><br>You don't know how true that is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I would've been happy if it was, but I'm getting trance ver</br>  <br>I have high hope for the customizers. <br><br>Kinda funny, after browsing through the pics. My wish list didn't decrease or increase in size. Keep the boats and idols stuff coming. Keep my wallet below rape point.</br></br></br>  This was a great summer for lolicons.  Which Idol is this?  <br>Is Minna not popular or something? I want more Minna. Or Barkhorn at least.<br><br>Is the new anime going to be about 502nd? Cant wait for those figs.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The worst.</br></br>  <br>Read their FAQ on combining orders with different release months.</br>  <br>Shit taste.</br>  <br>All of the Cinderella girls are except for Ranko, which is this one though?</br>  <br>Great taste.</br>  <br><br>I hope they make more bunny witches.</br></br>  <br>Guess I'll do that.<br>Thanks.</br></br>  <br>You can combine all those orders and request to pay in November</br>  <br>The difference is 9 years, and she was already sold at something like 10 or 20 units when she got out.<br><br>I can't understand a price this high so soon, even for limited prod, sorry.</br></br></br>  <br>Good taste.</br>  <br>She's really adorable, I'd go for it if I was a fan. The mouth doesn't look bad.</br>  <br>Is it wrong to want both of these?</br>  <br>You are a gentleman and a scholar.</br>  I'm surprised more people on here don't scalp, it seems like a pretty decent way to make some extra cash if you know what you're doing, and most of the buyfags do.  <br><br>Only because you acknowledge Ranko is best. It's Miku.</br></br>  <br>If you know enough to say that Ranko is best, then you should know who she is. Unless you only care about the superficial shit</br>  <br>I dunno. I just really lucky that 2 girls out of the 3 I like is getting good amount of figurines.<br><br><br>Buy them all!<br><br>Erica color kinda, somehow feel lacking.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The hype factor likely has something to do with it. People will pay a lot without thinking when they're hyped for something.</br>  <br><br>Its going to be good. The FAG customs have been great.</br></br>  <br>Something about these looks very off. I think it's the faces.</br>  <br>It's a waste of time.</br>  <br>If you could have gotten it 9 years prior wouldn't you have? If you passed on her at the same price point you would have been kicking yourself.<br><br>If you can't understand supply and demand then I can't help you.</br></br></br>  2016 gonna be a good year.  <br>Shinobu still a shit. Can't even see her panties.</br>  <br><br> I will buy them all.<br><br>I agree on Erica, I think its the pantyhose. They're much less brown on the original illustration. The hair needs a little shading too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's not much of a profit unless you buy exclusives or hit the jackpot on something spiking in price after release. Then there's the chance of someone completely fucking you over with a paypal/ebay dispute. Then there's dealing with the retards on MFC, it just isn't worth it for most people.</br>  I'm not sure how I feel about this one, maybe I should just hold out for a nendo in 5 years.  <br>Thanks!</br>  <br>What's with these figures that don't represent Sento's personality at all? First Koto and now this shit.</br>  <br>Will you sell me the Panaino! version?</br>  <br> Sento <br> Personality </br></br>  <br>So, is Rin a GK or not?</br>  <br>Did you even watch the anime? She literally craves the dick.</br>  <br>I don't watch anime</br>  <br>It is, still, somehow Im gonna get her.</br>  <br>you won't unless she gets recasted by gathering.</br>  <br>Sure she gets all embarrassed around Kanye as she notices more of her feelings for him... but otherwise she's not some shy, blushing girl. Mostly socially awkward around everyone.<br><br>Stronger and the upcoming Pirate one look the most fitting for her so far.</br></br></br>  <br>Well there was no other source material for Amagi, so I guess you have no business talking about Sento's personality then, do you??</br>  <br>I did way too much years working on market economy, so I think I understand maybe too much how it works actually and expect everyone to understand the mechanics and how to use them to the consumer advantage.<br><br>I would have buy it of course if I could at the time, but for 700 ? No way. She was rare, but not unfoundable, and cost something like 150. It's with time that a product become rarer and much more precious. Limited quantity or hype are just little factors to determine the value of an item.</br></br></br>  <br>you just don't get it do you?</br>  <br>Wasn't expecting too much that I'd want but this guy turned out nice.</br>  <br> Manufacturer: Aoshima <br>Who?<br>Anyways, that's lowest of the low. Her face is fucked up and it's like they took the proportions out of a QUALITY shot of the show.<br><br>She HAS to get at least a nendo soon,  RIGHT? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, I don't get why people are dumb.<br><br>Guess nobody can actually.<br><br>I won't argue more anyway, I can't change people brains ( Not talking about you, but the guys who bought it ).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>FunnyKnights. You know, the ones with a Griffon tier QC based on their Amatsukaze and still had the nerve to charge 17k for their Kongo.</br></br>  <br>I really hope so.<br>I just wanted more Nendos announced for Kiniro, Gochiusa and Non Non.<br>Scales would have been nice too but I wasn't counting on that.</br></br></br>  <br> I am so smart and can't understand why people are so dumb, unlike me <br> spends 700 on a single chinese plastic <br><br>genius</br></br></br></br>  <br> unfoundable <br>You mean unobtainable?</br></br>  <br>Let me dream.</br>  <br> I just wanted more Nendos announced for Kiniro, Gochiusa and Non Non. <br>This is all I wanted, and the only thing I got was Hotarun nendo, which is not Koma, and a third Yuru Yuri one.<br>Syaro, Koma and Karen need PVC love.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I knew it was wrong but couldn't find another word, sorry.</br>  <br>Ok, I can't be the only one who thought for a second this was that "I have a sperm dragon shooting out of my penis" figure.</br>  <br><br>700€, which is $770. And he's calling dumb to someone who spend $282.</br></br>  <br>I was hoping for Syaro, Aya and Komari the most.<br>Hotaru is nice but she's my least favorite to be honest.</br></br>  is it just the lighting or is this one intentionally supposed to look like john boehner?   The only new thing announced that I'm interested in is going to kill my wallet   <br>C A N A D A<br>A<br>N<br>A<br>D<br>A</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm insane and I can tell you you did well.<br>You did what you wanted.<br>Fuck the police.<br><br>Then again I might not be an authority on that sort of thing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's the lighting but she looks more realistic.</br>  Anyone is is planning getting her? My only complaint is that the animated ver was shit so far.  <br>Aya would be amazing too, and agree with Hotaru. She's also the one that works the least as a Nendo.</br>  <br>her chest is not big enough :(</br>  <br>That I don't have enough money for all the Chinese plastic I want.</br>   tfw missed two preorder windows this morning <br>I want to die</br>  <br>is this a new epic meme?</br>   Running Pochaco <br>Interesting</br>  <br>What bothers me the most is that she just got an announcement, no prototype or anything so who knows how long it will be before they get to Komari.<br>At least Alice is painted and looks adorable, Shino or Karen obviously have to be next.</br></br>  <br>What's their names?</br>  All I want is a cute figure of Ryuko in anything other than kamui Senketsu. Should I just settle and try for the Winter WF exclusive Ryuko RAH on Mandarake?  <br>it wants to be</br>  <br>It's based on this before her tits got as huge as they are now</br>  <br>I bet you didn't even pick up the RAH.<br><br>I agree tho. Even untransformed Senketsu would be welcome at this point.</br></br></br>  <br>It hurts to speak their names. I'm going to go be a melodramatic baby somewhere else for a little while.</br>  <br> At least Alice is painted and looks adorable <br>She does, unfortunately she isn't really my favorite and I'm not willing to get the entire cast of every Cute Girls Doing Cute Things show out there.<br>2 per show in my maximum, and Alice really isn't up there.</br></br></br>  I forgot Hotarumaru and Manryu, might get them if Koto doesn't fuck up.  How long is the wait until I can buy one?  <br>Probably by the end of the year, they're shitting these boats out quick and putting all their other shit on hold.</br>  <br>I need it.</br>  <br>Boats is a bubble after all, gotta cash in before it bursts.</br>  Preorders start on the 29th.<br>I know I'm not the only one who loves Miss Monochrome, right?</br>  <br><br>Fun is we still don't have MC's nendo.</br></br>  <br><br>This comment is giving me a Déjà vu from when 2hu became popular. We're now what, 2 decades later?</br></br>  <br>you realize kancolle is a game right? Fubuki isnt the MC of the game, anime was shit and should be forgotten.</br>  <br><br><br> (bottom)<br><br>Can not contain the excitement.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Probably because everything Fubuki crashed and burned. Only people who like her are shitty secondaries who somehow liked the abortion that the anime was.</br></br>  <br>Just what I've been looking for. Looks pretty good from what I can see.</br>  <br>I know, but the nendo is explicit "Anime Ver.", you would expect them to release her sooner.<br>Still mad we didn't got a Kai Ni version.</br></br>  <br>I just started watching the anime to justify buying this eventually.</br>   Sekai Project to localise GATE <br>Fuck</br>  <br>Please no.</br>  <br>Wha size? Anything bigger than 1/6 is a no</br>  <br><br>Of course they'll make the anime version, her actual design in the game is dog shit, but you already knew that, right?</br></br>  Who is your favorite waifu?  <br>It's too late anon, accept the future of manga localisation<br><br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-07-25/sekai-project-enters-m<wbr>anga-publishing-market-with-gate/.9<wbr>0887<br><br>They're going to bankrupt themselves, they have no actual experience with genuine retail</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Ironic shitposting is still shitposting</br>  <br>1/4 aprox, also vinyl not pvc</br>  <br>There's nothing wrong with Sekai Project.</br>  <br>Not her Kai Ni, but I guess you didn't knew that, right?</br>  <br>I like her but not enough to buy things of her.</br>  <br>I hope /ak/ will keep doing it.</br>  <br>fubushits kai2 is just as bad as fubushit in general</br>  <br><br>Why complain? It's the fucking manga. Now there's a chance Yen Press gets the LN and everybody wins. You fucking secondaries.</br></br>  <br>This is the best pochako</br>  <br>Please don't say that anon.<br>She could use your support.</br></br>  <br>The Kai Ni they released because of the Anime. Also, even if it's and improvement is still shit.</br>  <br>2fat for ballerinas, lazy poses as well. <br>Although Tony is all about health and fashion clothes instead of irrelevant face for characterization so these of course will sell and end up in many boring collections.</br></br>  <br>Ugh. I just want good, decent sized Fairy Tail figs.</br>  <br>The anime was good. Only edgyfags and anons who picked the wrong starter hated it.</br>  <br><br>I like it, was the reason I bought Koto's Bucky.<br><br>I wish they'd do more Fubiki-Class though, would love a Hatsuyuki.</br></br></br></br>  Ready for a futanari figure?  <br>Sounds like you did anon, nanodesu is best starter.</br>  <br> You fucking secondaries. <br>What does that even mean when we are talking about manga? How much of a elitist wannabe can you be?</br></br>  Any new Nanoha figures shown this wonfes? Maybe something for Vivid or even A's?  <br>Where have they been all my life. I don't think I've ever seen one.<br>But character looks way too crappy in the face, unfortunately.</br></br>  <br> What does that even mean when we are talking about manga? <br> Reading the manga adaptation is now not considered secondary <br>Jesus fuck it's summer</br></br></br>  <br>That figure just convinced me to finally watch this show.</br>  Which shipgirl has the best stern? I vote Taihou.  You wouldn't a carrier.  <br>They didn't even let Yoshinori draw summer sprites even though he really wanted to draw swimsuits and I'm pretty sure Yoshinori is cheaper than Fumikane.</br>  <br> Not  daijoubu</br>  <br>He would have done it for free if he really wanted to.</br>  <br><br> very  diajoubu</br></br>  I want to fuck a hamster.                                <br>Thank you for the dump. Hayate is great lately.</br>  Such a best girl.  <br> Las Vegas <br><br>CTMEOY intensifies.</br></br></br>  <br>Ayumu is love!</br>  <br>I'm glad someone else understands.</br>  <br>It certainly is a rare occasion.</br>  <br><br>I want Hina-chan to glare and bully me into making the correct decisions in my life.</br></br>   Hayate 501  <br><br>Holy shit, really?<br><br>Is this going to end any time soon? Who is winning the Hatyatebowl?</br></br></br></br>  <br>We all know who wins.</br>  <br>Here's your counterpoint</br>  <br>Five hundred and one chapters and you still haven't learned that Hayate accidentally spills those sorts of lines without thinking constantly.<br>I'm impressed.</br></br>  <br> Hata going full CTMEOY. <br>Is Ruka coming back? Please Hata!<br><br><br>Holy shit, Yukiji completely OWNED Hina.<br><br>BASED.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   501 chapters <br>What the fuck<br><br>I dropped this after the Greece arc since the quality took a huge dive, what the fuck happened since then?</br></br></br>  <br>He said the exact same line to Ruka.<br>We all know how it ended.</br></br>    <br>Good old S1.<br>Best season.</br></br>  <br>Idolshit that noone liked outside of Japan. it's gotten back on track lately with the current arc being entertaining.</br>  <br>I expected LOLHINAWINS on this.<br>Glad I was wrong.<br>Yukiji's keikaku is completely based.</br></br></br>  <br>Kuro Tsubaki soon.<br><br>maybe we'll also see Himegami?</br></br></br>   Hayate no Gotoku is still ongoing <br> 500+ chapters <br>Jesus fuck, has this become a generic battle shounen like Negima?</br></br>  <br>If Ruka appears /a/ explodes.<br>The only way I can see Hina winning this is if Hata wants to make her this series' Ayase (aka gets to confess and gets BTFO because Nagi/Athena)</br></br>  <br><br><br>Hata will never let go of this money train.</br></br></br>  <br>no, a generic comedy manga</br>  <br>It's something like Gintama but based on a high school...</br>  <br>Was she always this stacked?</br>    A-tan reappearing when?  <br>I want to see some more Ruka, she stir up the other girls like no one. Also her and Hayate interactions were great.</br>  <br>If Athena appeared and claimed her husband, it would be a tsunami.</br>  <br>When did she get so stacked?</br>  <br>True, he does have a habit of blurting out his opinions of the girls that surround him.<br><br>He did, but Hayate's actually mentioned how much he admires Hinagiku a number of times over the manga, both casually and seriously. Also Ruka was introduced incredibly far into to the manga. She was written off as a non winner by the community right from the beginning of her crush. Everyone else has had a great deal of time and effort putting in their character development, having the new girl pop out of nowhere and sweep him up would have caused torches and pitchforks. Everyone would basically agree that anyone would be better than Ruka just so can avoid feeling like our time and investment were cheated. Very similar to how Nisekoi has the sensei/childhood friend come in late and was eliminated before she got any development. Meanwhile Hina has been part of the cast from early on and has been incredibly helpful in every arc since her introduction.<br><br>Also just a litter fun wordplay when I saw this image. Hayate says queen and in his mind he thinks Athena. But Hina's practically a princess type given her general personality, her work ethic, the respect she is given, and even her name. What happens princesses when they marry? (Assuming they or they hubby has succession)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here you go, ho ho ho!</br>    <br>Wasn't Las Vegas the setting of a previous arc? I skipped a huge chunk of Hayate chapters and I should probably go back and read them.</br>  So many good tsundere in this series.  <br> Ruka was introduced far into the manga. <br>She was introduced right after Athena's arc.<br> Hina has been part of the cast from early on and has been incredibly helpful in every arc since her introduction. <br>Izumi, Athena and Nagi are way more important for Hayate's life than Hinagiku.<br>Hinagiku can be a good partner, but that means nothing. Now that you compare Hayate with Nisekoi, Hinagiku would be Hayate's Tsugumi.<br>Also, remember, the series is called Hayate the combat BUTLER. I don't want cries when Nagi wins like it happened with Oreimo.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i think that was Athens.<br><br>well, Nagi would probably bought all the Greek islands because why not.</br></br></br>    <br>I think you're forgetting something very important.</br>  Is Wataru x Sakuya really a thing? Or is it just my shipper delusion years ago?  <br>Wataru wanted Isumi IIRC.</br>  <br>Wasn't there an arc that had Wataru's mom show up?</br>  <br>Chirstmas only in 6 months time, anon.<br><br>a very long 6 months time....</br></br></br>  <br>so, the manga gets shittier and they upgrade hamster?</br>  <br><br><br>Wataru gave up on Isumi after she became comic relief/deus ex machina and is going to marry Saki, a girl twice his age.</br></br></br>   501 <br>Wow. I stopped reading this in the doujinshi arc. Did something good happen after that?</br>  <br>Hayate and Maria going on a date.<br><br>Nagi's little sister showed up.<br><br>Fanservice. Lots of fanservice and Hayate moments with other girls like Chiharu.<br><br>Izumi getting bullied.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot Nagi getting back to the mansion.<br>I will never forget that emotional moment with Nagi remembering all the adventures in the apartment with the other girls.</br></br>  <br>I thought this shit ended years ago.</br>  Izumi best girl.  <br>I'm not forgetting Maria. The manga forgot about her. Soon she'll be working part time with Klaus if things keep progressing this way. Unless she gets some new developments all she has going for her story wise is that she's an orphan with no knowledge of her heritage.<br><br>Yes. Ruka was introduced right after the most important arc to date. That's like saying you got the main act and the warm up act mixed up. A full 5 years after after the show started.<br><br>I'll give you Athena because she helped him out when he was a midgit and for being the Antagonist durng her namesake's arc. And Nagi helping pay off his debts. But Izumi? She has almost no impact on anything other than the accidental fanservice and the little bit about the marriage promise that neither remember.<br><br>At very minimum Hina and Hayate have saved each other's lives several times. Helped him with school work. And is now trying to help him pay off his debt.<br><br> remember, tha the series is called Hayate the combat BUTLER <br>Fine I'll take it. remember the series is called "Hayate the COMBAT Butler". Combat wise the series has shown Hayate, his brother, Athena, Hinagiku, and to a lesser extent her sister to be any good at actual combat. Everyone else would be the equivalent of named NPC. And remember Dragonball? Goku, the strongest man on Earth ended up marrying Chi-chi, the strongest woman on Earth (the same thing sort of happened with Gohan and Videl, but 18 was the strongest woman). I don't want cries when Hayate ends up partnering with someone who can actually fight.<br><br> :P </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Nice tan.  <br>Yes, pretty much. It's not very noticeable in earlier seasons because she always had that thick school uniform coat on.</br>  <br>I don't think that's exactly decided yet. Wataru still has shiptease with both Sakuya and Saki, only Isumi is out of the bowl.</br>  A-tan best girl.<br>Hayate agrees too.</br>   Chiharu secret best girl   <br>Izumi kept Hayate's soul alive when he thought he'd lost Athena.</br>  <br>Except that Wataru promised Saki that he'd make a lot of money so she wouldn't have to work as his maid anymore, while blushing like a tomato. Sakuya is only still teased with him because she helps him out with money problems.<br><br> I really miss Hayate being her onii-chan. </br></br></br>  <br> I want her to pretend to seduce Hayate just to get Hina to take the initiative, then realize she's fallen for her fake love. </br>  <br>No.<br><br>Watch Season 1 Ep 37 at ~17:00 mins, she's been enhanced. I was going to post a screen, but I realized the DL on my laptop is fuckin' censored. I even checked against the free crunchyroll stream and there's a shitload more steam on mine.</br></br></br>  Since when did Hamster have those tits?  <br> anime <br>You need to go by the manga m9.</br></br>  <br> Now that you compare Hayate with Nisekoi, Hinagiku would be Hayate's Tsugumi. <br>Are you on drugs?</br></br>  <br>If anything, Nagi would be Hayate's Chitoge because his original hiring was based on a romantic misunderstanding, though personality-wise she's more like Haru. Hamster would be Onodera, both because she was his classmate first and has had a crush on him for a long time. Hinagiku is more like Chitoge in personality, except she's known her feelings for him for a long time and hasn't tried to deny it. <br><br>Maria or Kotona (the girl who kissed him after the quest to get the King's Jewel) would be his Tsugumi.</br></br></br>  <br>I actually liked the few chapters in between the current arc and the idolshit better than the current arc. They are the high point of the post-Athena arc part of the series for me.<br><br>Those are the kind of chapters that truly make Hayate in my opinion.</br></br></br>  <br>I remember being told to just watch the anime to some point if I ever do. Season 3 or something and just pretending it ends there.</br>  <br>  Hayate says queen and in his mind he thinks Athena <br>Maria's a queen too.</br></br>  <br>It's no use trying to make parallels with Nisekoi because, unlike Komi, Hata is not a complete hack.<br><br>Saying that Hinagiku is in any way like Tsugumi was just specially dumb.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, she is manly.</br>  <br>That's not SKET Dance</br>  <br>In a completely different way than Hinagiku.</br>  <br> I want her to try it as Haru, before getting found out </br>  <br>Well you did say seasons.</br>  <br>I still remember Tanaka Rie's ara ara</br>  <br>I'm not the original anon you were replying to, though.</br>   a Hayate thread that's 90+ post <br><br>My word.</br></br>  This show seems cool but I heard it goes to shit later.  <br>In that case I did read at least up to volume 10 but I started engineering classes and I lost interest. <br><br>After so long the only thing that would make me pick it back up is Hammy. Does she get decent page time?</br></br></br>  <br>The first two seasons are worth it. <br><br>S1 specially is amazing.</br></br></br>  <br>Stick to S1 and you won't be disappointed, also all the torrents I've found are visually censored. Bizarrely enough though the CR streams are the only ones lacking visual censorship.</br>  <br>censored?</br>  <br>Just get SS-Eclipse release</br>  <br>More like Hamster is healthy Marika, she got rejected once and still not giving up<br><br> Nagi = Chitoge <br>Based on her development(more like none) I can hardly approve it, even Hayate himself(so far I suppose)</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait sorry not hamster, I mean Ayumu</br>  <br>Ep 37 is the prime example.<br><br>Top is Torrent bottom is shit CR stream, laziest edit I've ever done but it illustrates my point.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll check out the first season.</br>  <br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=1<wbr>93924<br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=1<wbr>93929</wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br>I'm surprised too. I thought it'd die before I caught up, since I was like 10 chapters behind, but to my surprise it survived for hours.<br><br>Guess I underestimated the power of the hamster.<br><br><br>Huh, I actually started Hayate on the same month I started Engineering classes, funny coincidence.<br><br>And I'd say no, she doesn't really get a lot of focus, but her (and Izumi's) chapters are always top tier, so I'd recommend reading it anyways. Hayate is easier to marathon than read weekly anyways.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have it and the other popular one. Eclipse has an "audio de-censor" that removes some bleeps but that's it. I must have watched it on CR at some point to know it was visually uncensored</br>  <br> wait sorry not hamster, I mean hamster <br>Also, stop comparing this to Nisekoi pls.</br></br>  <br>Ayumu is hamster, it's Nagi's nickname for her.</br>    I want to fuck a Nagi  <br><br>Oops I am so panic that I thought hamster = Izumi<br><br> Also, stop comparing this to Nisekoi pls <br>Just adding a note I found accurate, sorry about that<br><br>Wonder who will win in this arc</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Izumi does need a nickname, in my opinion.</br>  <br> 19 gb with no seeds <br>Th-thanks.</br></br>  <br> Cute airhead with dumb luck <br>How to conclude that</br></br>  <br>Season 1 has seeds and I'm downloading right now, what are you talking about?</br>  <br> Combat wise the series has shown Hayate, his brother, Athena, Hinagiku, and to a lesser extent her sister to be any good at actual combat. <br>Isumi is also skilled at combat, semi-prominently. Then you have characters nobody remembers like Himuro, Kanade, Makina (he's a goddamned Jormungandr), and the recently-relevant Sonia. Himegami is implied to be skilled as well, but has currently only appeared in the first anime.</br></br>  Isumi and Izumi are best girl<br><br>Izumi a bit better though</br></br>  <br> Slut </br>  <br> slut <br> still devoted to Hayata-kun ever since her childhood </br></br>   33 posters <br> thread that doesn't immediately fall off the board <br>Hayate is saved. The curse of Doujinamek is over. Now we just need Hina to win and buy Hayate off of Nagi.</br></br>  Is it finally Hina's year?  <br>2016 will be her year!</br>  <br>m. bison is that you?</br>  <br>How long has it been? Fuck I missed you guys.<br><br> Old hags a best. </br></br></br>  <br> tfw your Hina images are so old that you can't even find all of them in your image macro folder anymore </br>  <br>No, it's only just beginning. We're stuck in America now.</br>  So why exactly does the manga go to shit?  <br>not enough combat butler things</br>  <br>Is it because of hamster?</br>  <br>It doesn't. It's simply a matter of whether or not you like this sort of thing. I, for one, am perfectly happy with there being buttloads of pointless gag chapters in between serious plot points. Thanks to that I feel that HnG characters are among the most fleshed-out of manga I read.<br><br>I admit it does get kind of annoying when it takes so long to get to plot that characters are forgotten (Wataru's mother still has a Hougyoku iirc, and what the fuck happened to Housen motherfucking Yozora?).</br></br></br>  <br> Implying hamster is actually popular <br>I am happy with that<br>The author should take at look at this</br></br></br>  Holy shit a Hayate thread. And I should update this   <br> Sharuna and Fumi <br>Kek. You know, I'm not a big fan of theirs, but I have to admit it feels a little lonely with them not having a skit this arc.</br></br>  <br>I loved the reference to Banjou and his role in HNK as Souther.<br><br>Hamster is love, Hamster is life.</br></br></br>  <br> Kana Asumi and Saori Gotou have been a part of Hayate since 2008 and have had less than 5 minutes of screen time across 4 seasons and a movie </br>  <br> That aquarion reference. <br>Really.</br></br>  Is thread dead?  <br>It's late at night.</br>  Why was Athens arc not animated? I need my drug  I hate to bring this up, but did Hata write off Maria's entire backstory when she mentioned being brought to Mykonos to translate the legendary inscription? <br><br>Or do you think he's still planning to do a Masterpiece Theater-style story arc for her?</br></br>  <br> Manglobe <br> Having complete S2 and a bunch of OVAs that sold poorly <br> Wanting them to animate A-Tan's arc <br>These are the geniuses behind SamFlam and Gangsta. If they had animated it, nobody would've seen it and it wouldn't be possible to get a better studio to animate it.<br><br> Chapter 500 <br> You Can Make Another Anime If You Want <br>Hata has no control over this does he.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Girl on the left even looks kinda like the chick from it, hairstyle wise anyway.</br>  <br>Back up plan for when the manga is indeed no longer as profitable.</br>  <br>Even more, Isumi is the strongest character of the series.</br>  <br>So what are you saying is Hayate ends with either Isumi or Athena, and Hina maybe gets Himegami?</br>  <br>Hata is just in it for the money.</br>  <br>the same thing as why there is no TWGOK VN to appease the souls of those who were crushed.</br>  Sakuya back when?  <br>She's on par with A-tan</br>  <br>Is maria still relevant?</br>  <br>True.<br>But the truth is, Hinagiku is NOT the strongest character of the series.<br><br>BTW: I think final contest will be a karaoke contest with Ruka as judge. <br>And now we should put our dream covers if this results to be the contest.</br></br></br></br></br>  I used to watch this a long time ago. Is it worth picking up the manga?  <br>There was something like that. Girls ended up in bunny girls suits.</br>  <br>It's fun, yeah. Don't expect some complex story or character development tho. Also don't speedread it or you'll get bored.<br><br>If it's still your thing then pick it up</br></br></br>  <br>TWGOK had, what, 28 potential romantic interests if you add in the demon girls? <br><br>They should've made the TWGOK VN something similar to Pokemon or Norn's split games, with the girls split up over something like 6 games.</br></br></br>  <br>Maria who?<br><br>  R.I.P Maria ;_;  </br></br></br>  <br>Me too</br>  <br>She's Hayate's flirting date and she knows ancient languages that're sure to show up as the race for the stones heats up.</br>  The most successful Hayate thread in years.<br>I can say without mistake: This is Ayumu's year.</br>  <br> Hamster's year <br> Not Hina's year <br>In all honesty, it's Hayate's year.</br></br></br>  <br>Already dismissing her 2015 victory?<br>She is eligible for 2015 right?</br></br>  <br> not A-tan <br><br>what is wrong with you</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>What a powerful and magnificent beast!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do people still care? She won an ISML already, that's quite a feat. I always give her my votes (sans one matchup), but I'm totally satisfied that she's been crowned once already.</br>  <br> ISML </br>  <br> ISML <br> 2009, aka "her year", when JC Staff did everything to make her the most popular character of the series. </br></br>  hamster is for sexualizing    Shit, a Hayate thread with over a hundred replies? I'm surprised there's so many people still reading this.<br><br>Anyways, I'm really enjoying the current arc. The comedy has stepped up a bit, and it feels like we're getting some actual plot progression.<br><br>It's kind of suspicious that the prize money is exactly the same amount as his debt. Do you guys think Hayate will win and be able to pay off all of his debt? Knowing Hata, he'll have some shitty twist where Hayate wins the money but loses it all to interest on that black credit card he used a few chapters back.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The obvious result would be Nagi's win, by Hayate surrendering at the end.<br>And each time this arc looks more like CTMEOY, my theory grows stronger.<br>Check the CTMEOY episodes in Las Vegas for further proof.</br></br></br>  <br>He hasn't used that card yet right?<br><br>Also what's up with Izumi/Isumi? Couldn't Hata come up with better names?</br></br></br>  <br>It's not as much of an issue in Japanese since they're names are written 泉 and 伊澄.</br>  <br> She is eligible for 2015 right? <br>There was some Hayate animation this year?<br><br>Does Saimoe even still exist?</br></br></br></br>   this thread is still alive <br>Well, fug.<br><br>I'm never underestimating the power of hamster's hamsters again.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't remember what the cut off line is but the last ova was in december.<br><br>And yes, Sakimoe still exists.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought it had died last year.<br><br>Cut off is either 31 June or July, if I'm not mistaken, but I didn't know an OVA had come out. Was it manga adaptation or original content?</br></br></br>  <br>the power of hamster and die hard</br>  <br>There were three OVAs, the first in June, the second in September and the third in December.</br>  What kind of girls have playing cards like these?  <br>S ophisticated individuals. </br>  <br>Always.</br>  So I stopped reading this around the time Hina and Hayate went off to the island to find magic curry ingredients or some shit. Has anything interesting actually happened, or is Hata still in full on meandering filler mode?  <br>Hayate animation releases always elude me to be honest.<br><br><br>Nice trips.<br><br>The few chapters in between that arc and the current arc are top tier, in my opinion. The current arc is also reasonably good, and stuff is actually happening.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This manga might still be running 12000 years from now.<br> 14015 will be her year </br></br>  <br>Hina's year was 2009...</br>  <br>The sexiest.</br>  <br><br>The bestest.</br></br>  <br>Nice, maybe I'll pick it back up then. I was feeling pretty salty after Hata introduced the best girl and then immediately dropped her because having somebody actually tell Hayate she wants his dick would break the harem.</br>  <br>Brief reminder that Hinagiku was the only member of the harem who didn't help Nagi to beat Ruka in the doujinshi contest...she was doing some shit at the student council.</br>  Hinagiku is best girl  <br>I'm pretty sure she helped one of them, but I don't remember who.</br>  <br> Is it finally Hina's year? <br>No. 2015 is finally the year of the Linux Desktop.</br></br>  <br> This image was made 5 years ago. <br> It still isn't Hina's year <br><br>Being Hina is suffering.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We should get one of Hina in a Tux costume.</br>  <br>The sluttiest</br>  Must be suffering to be a fan of this series.  <br>All I want is A-tan's arc animated.</br>  <br>Why? It's my favourite manga, and I'm happy with the current status quo. Unless you mean not having anybody to talk to about it, in which case, yes, suffering.</br>  <br>Maybe if you're anime-only like  me </br>  <br>It is.</br>  i just wish that Sore ga Seiyuu shows something HnG related.<br><br>fuck, even time flow faster in SgS</br></br>  <br>Here's one.</br>  I want to fuck a izumi  I love Ayuyuyu!!!  <br> it will never be year of the Hina desktop </br>  <br>I'm actually thankful Hayate is going forever. It's the only one of my favorite series that I picked up early on when I started watching that hasn't gone to shit or ended. I'll feel a huge feeling of emptiness when it ends, more so than with Negima or KamiNomi.</br>  <br> actually thankful Hayate is going forever <br>I personally like it because it makes the meta jokes all the more poignant.<br><br>I wouldn't laugh as hard at the "THIS IS JUST HOW HAYATE IS DEAL WITH IT" shticks if this shit was just around 200 chapters or something.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Indeed, those gags get funnier every time. I love it every time Hata breaks the fourth wall.</br>  <br><br>Well Hina helped Ruka during the first doujinshi competition.</br></br>  <br>Hinagiku's teaching policy is actually bretty gud.<br><br>Setting up small goals and accomplishing them in a steady fashion is a lot more productive than setting up large goals and letting your schedule slip until you finally give up.</br></br></br>  <br> Spells her own name wrong. <br><br>Izumi is mind shatteringly cute.</br></br></br>  <br>End game: Nagi's anime hires the Sore cast to voice the characters.</br>  <br>Not really. The cast is likable.<br>But seeing Ayumu is suffering.</br></br>  <br>Why is it suffering, I find it to be the main reason I re watch the anime.</br>    <br>Not at all.</br>    <br>It's a numbing feeling over time.</br>  <br>He probably meant that being a hamster was suffering.</br>  <br>A lot of people are happy with where the series is, so it's alright.<br><br>Personally, I'm not. The mangaka wrote himself into a corner a few years ago and so now the manga basically follows this trend of<br> Pretend to have a plot <br> Just kidding there's no plot, have a new character who will disappear in 3 chapters like a guest character on a scooby doo episode <br> Or is there a plot? <br> Hehe remember that thing I put in the first chapter that had no meaning until I wrote myself into a corner and needed straws to grasp at <br> Just kidding there's no plot here have another girl <br> What? Why would I do anything with these dozen or so girls that are already introduced and have tons of potential scenarios? <br> Pls make another anime I need to pay rent <br><br>The only reason I still read is because he throws in girls in bikinis literally every other chapter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can actually see Hayate ending some time. There have been quite a few chapters that reference the coming christmas as the final arc. Maybe by chapter 700, echoing Naurto?</br>  What the hell is going on?  <br>Personally I'm capitalizing on an opportunity to converse with fellow hamster devotees.</br>  <br>expressing my lust for hamster</br>  <br>Well, yeah, I think from the very beginning it was supposed to end in a year of in-story time.<br><br>But we're in September, and it's taken 500 chapters to get here.<br><br>At that pace, it would be ending by chapter 666, approximately.<br><br>By the way, if it does end on Christmas, Nagi has a higher than expected chance to win this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Izumi a cute!<br>A CUTE!</br>  <br>We're having an enjoyable and  rare  Hayate thread.

I also think she makes more sense with Wataru than Saki.</br></br></br>  <br>pretty based.<br>Should appear more often.</br></br>  At least Hinagiku has given up on him, right?  <br>I don't remember correctly, but didn't Hina appear before Sakuya? IIRC they first presented the Katsura sisters and the student council and then Sakuya &amp; Isumi...<br><br> Hinagiku <br> giving up <br>Choose one.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just realized she's actually two day's older than me. <br><br>For me she's right behind Hamster and Izumi.</br></br></br>  <br>It's going to happen.</br>  <br>I can't choose both? She should realize he is an asexual muppet by now.</br>  <br>It only Ruka who's given up on him.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Sakuya and Isumi appeared way before Hina and Izumi and the rest, because the formers appeared very early on in the story as Nagi's friends, and the latters appeared until Hayate went to school for the first time.</br>  <br>Yeah you can.<br>She's still in the bowl because of muh popularity.</br></br>  <br>Hayate went to give lunch to Nagi when he still wasn't a student of Hakuou, and there he met Hina and Yukiji for the first time.</br>  <br>Yeah, I know. But Sakuya and Isumi went to play at Nagi's mansion before that.<br><br>What I don't really remember is if Izumi appears on that time where Hayate brings Nagi her lunch, or not until Hayate transfers.</br></br></br>  <br>Isumi and Sakuya appeared before Hakuo was even introduced. I'm also sure that Sakuya has some onii-chan complex with Hayate.</br>  <br>Izumi appears along with the rest of the student council talking about Yukiji (she was doing a Saint Seiya-like move, the "Drunk Punch")</br>  Is anime after season 2 any good?  <br>I rather liked CTMEOY<br><br><br>I thought her first appearance (along with the other two girls) had been in the classroom when Hayate transfers.</br></br></br></br>  <br> CTMEOY <br>But that's entirely non-canon right? While Cuites has Athena, Ruka, and the Violet Mansion?</br></br>  <br>Canon doesn't mean shit as far as HnG is concerned.</br>  <br>The current arc of the manga has a lot of references to CTMEOY. Tsugumi Ruri, Las Vegas, the organizer of this contest...</br>  Holy shit this series is painfully unfunny now.  <br>It will be canon in some months.</br>  Wait.<br><br>I thought CTMEOY was literally canon and we were just waiting for the manga to get there ever since it aired.<br><br>Not in the "it was made as a preview for what the manga would be like" kind of way, but in the "the manga will skip this because we already have it" kind of way.<br><br>Kinda like HIAPOE (don't tell me this isn't canon either, please).</br></br></br></br></br></br>   More than 250 posts <br>Welcome back!</br>  Let's remember:<br> manglobe </br>  <br>Remember, we've had a lot of long arcs filling up those 500 chapters. So if it goes back to comedic slice of life we could reach December much sooner. But then again, we could also see it not come around until 800 or so.</br>  <br>Caring about canon in Hayate is silly. The anime have always been doing its own thing by mixing/shuffling around manga materials while incorporating new materials at the same time.</br>  <br>On the contrary, comedic slice of life can go on forever, while long arcs tend to speed up the passage of time.<br><br>You can talk about doujinamek all you want, but more than half of the chapters of that arc aren't really related to it.<br><br>In any case, I'm hoping for 1000 chapters.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>The third is a movie right? Why does it look so shit? <br><br>Frills are hard, but at least she no longer looks like Hayate.</br></br></br>  <br>I know, but I thought the whole point of CTMEOY and the movie was covering material that could otherwise have been in the manga.</br>  <br>I do miss the detail in the earlier chapters.</br>  <br>They didn't even keep Ayumu's shtick of eating something every episode.<br> saved: 20/9/2007 <br>Fucking</br></br></br>  Did the last OVA predict the end of the series?  <br> The third is a movie right? Why does it look so shit? <br>I don't think it looks so bad, it's just a different art style.<br><br> Frills are hard <br>lel, I didn't even notice the lack of frills</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now that's QUALITY!</br>  <br>Another pic from that OVA<br> ayumu's face </br></br>  <br>I really don't see how Nagi end is even remotely possible at this point. Hayate's still seeing her as nothing more than a daughter type.</br>  <br> I still love her. </br>  <br>Just look at details on Nagi's hair. The movie is nearly monotone and hardly has any details.</br>  <br>Let's see how the series advances...</br>  <br>did Klaus took the picture?</br>  <br>I believed that about Usagi Drop, Zettai Karen Children, and Rotte no Omocha.<br><br>Rin fucked Daikichi and had his kid, with an age gap of more than 20 years.<br><br>Minamoto and Karen seemed to be set on the path to romance, though the new male character is getting in the way.<br><br>Rotte married her stepfather Naoya with a 12 year age difference after her mother decided it was in Rotte's best interests to marry Naoya and be his wife rather than have her marry him and be Rotte's father.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Purely from 500+ chapters of development, there's realistically only Athena and Hinagiku.</br>  <br>And Hata worked in Zettai Karen Children...</br>  <br> Hinagiku using fear to have Hayate obey her <br>You mean Athena, Maria and Ayumu, true?</br></br>  <br>It was probably the narrator xDDD</br>  <br>It was the robot.</br>  <br>If only.

Isumi used to be cute, now it looks like she is upset all the time   Used to be a HnG fan back in the day when the series was huge on /a/ <br> Marathon season 1 back in 2009 in 2 days <br> Read all the manga in 3 day <br> Was there when Hinafags got BTFO <br> Was there during the glorious days of the A-tan arc <br><br>It just is not the same. The mangaka arc literally killed the manga for a lot of people. Doesn't help they skipped animating the best arc.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's Manglobe's fault, they don't know how to draw her</br>  <br>Is there an archive of /a/ from when Hinafags got BTFO?</br>    So this thread convinced me to pick this series back up after dropping it at the end of the doujin arc. Somehow the beach arc that followed it managed to be even worse.<br><br>I'm starting to wonder if Hata actually has the story planned out or if he just makes it up as he goes. Anyways, only about 40 chapters left till I'm caught up, so I think I'll keep going.</br></br>  <br>Just search Hinafags late 2009<br>Nonstop getting BTFO<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/248266<wbr>50/</wbr></br></br></br>  Food captcha pleases her.  <br> 6 <br>Fucking Manglobe when will they go bankrupt.</br></br>  <br>HOLY<br>FUCKING<br>SHIT<br>Thank you anon.<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/289177<wbr>91/#q28918521</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Man, Hayate threads used to be pretty popular back then.</br></br>  <br> comparing Hina with Mikoto <br> Getting BTFO at Saimoe by Yui and Nagi getting into the finals (aka the birth of "this is her year") <br> Hayate threads popular <br><br>What wonderful times have I missed...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Currently making one</br>  <br>You knew what happened in Papakiki?<br>The MC has development with an onee-san all the series, until the last volume, when the author threw all to the thrash and made him marry one of his "daughters".</br></br>  <br>The best examples of a Nagi end are:<br>-Shakugan no Shana<br>-Toradora.<br>-Zero no Tsukaima.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seems fine to me.</br>  <br>Except the development of the story and characters is completely different in those 3 series compared to HnG</br>  When this thread dies we can say we were in the most successful Hayate thread since Athena's arc.  <br>Yeah, that one wasn't very good, but it picks up from there.</br>  Makes me happy to see a thread on /a/ for this show when I just recently finished the first season and started the second. You guys have convinced me to check out the manga when I'm done with the rest of the anime.<br><br> Nagi a best </br></br>  <br>And all thanks to hamster's hamsters</br>  <br>Izumi stronk</br>  <br>Based hamster<br><br>Nice quads.<br>Yeah Izumi stronk, I didn't expect so little difference between her and Athena/Hina.<br>BTW, still 11 characters with 0 votes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> chihiro <br>Kill yourself</br></br>  <br>I think Athena is out of the running, actually.<br><br>Hinagiku is raising all the flags right now, but that's probably counter productive unless the manga is nearing its end. The fact that she never gets to confess, however, works in her favor.<br><br>Izumi will probably get to confess at some point near the end before dropping out. She's probably one of Hata's favorite characters though.<br><br>Ayumu has close to zero chances due to confessing early AND supporting Hina on top of that.<br><br>Nagi has pretty high chances if the series ends on Christmas.<br><br>Maria who?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 1080p <br> chihiro <br>The best release for the first and second seasons is SS-Eclipse 720p, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Also, Hayate has kissed girls like A-tan, Ruka and that nobody called Konoha, and he kissed and was kissed by Nagi.<br>Curiousely, he never kissed Hinagiku or Ayumu...<br>BTW, if the series ends in Christmas, Maria's chances of winning increase a lot, because her birthday is in Christmas Eve.</br></br></br>  <br> and he kissed and was kissed by Nagi. <br>I seriously don't remember this.</br></br>  <br>Kissed Nagi: Athena's arc, when she breaks the King's Jewel to stop Hayate's suffering.<br>Was kissed by Nagi: in one episode at the bath, she kissed him, and IIRC he was also kissed after Sakuya's birthday ended. Also the OVAs from 2014 if you want to count anime.</br></br>  <br><br>Tell this to BakaBT.</br></br>  <br>BakaBT links for SS-Eclipse:<br>First season: https://bakabt.me/torrent/149122/ha<wbr>yate-no-gotoku-hayate-the-combat-bu<wbr>tler-720p-rawako<br>Second season: https://bakabt.me/torrent/148261/ha<wbr>yate-no-gotoku-2nd-season-720p-ss-e<wbr>clipse</wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> trusting bakabt <br> ever <br><br>You're an idiot</br></br></br></br>  <br> BakaBT <br><br>Fuckin' pleb.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, for Hayate Nyaa isn't also the best source.</br></br>  <br>I really don't want a Nagi end. Unlike the examples here , Hayate has never seen Nagi as anything but a child. Nagi's character development also focuses heavily on her learning to stand on her own feet, which seems counter to her always living with (and relying on) Hayate. <br><br>Plus I recall a chapter where Hayate says that time is coming soon (Xmas) where he will no longer be Nagi's bulter.<br><br>Plugging for an Ayumu end myself</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No you moron </br>  Now I know that I missed some major arcs covering the Ayeka and Wataru's mom, but I don't remember which chapters these are. Anyone remember?   Check catalog for Berserk <br> Nothing <br><br>Fix up, anons.<br><br>I like how Rickert is going through the same thoughts that Guts had after rescuing Casca in the conviction arc. Whether to leave for friends that he's lost or stay and protect his only remaining family.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just want to read about guts' extravagant voyages</br>  It's a surreal feeling seeing previews for the next chapter so soon. It's going to take a while for the fact that it's monthly to sink in for me.  <br>Fuck is he just going to skip the whole thing of elf island and do a time skip? I know that sounds far fetched but taking this much time away from the main character when we finally were about to some closure. Seems like he's just trying with our emotions</br>  i've been on vacations, does anyone have the link for the chapter?  <br>I couldn't find it in google</br>  <br><br>Dont think the ch has been translated yet, i have only found the Chinese raws</br></br>  <br>Someone uploaded it on imgur, you could try the archives.</br>  <br>I see some new scenes.</br>  <br> monthly <br>How many pages has it?</br></br>  <br>20-25.</br>  <br>is that femto on that bird statue</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Are you niggas serious? It was already released by Evil Genius.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rakshas.</br>  <br>Well what do you know, this anon's right. Just go to EG</br>  <br>Holy shit, i was screaming at the top of my lungs when i saw this shit.<br>How long has it been, 8-10 month or something?</br></br>  <br> Berserk CCCXXXVIII <br><br>Oh EG you so silly</br></br></br>  <br><br>http://bato.to/read/_/334914/berser<wbr>k_v38_ch338_by_evil-genius</wbr></br></br>  <br><br> Only Guts is looking at Rickert <br> 18 year old Guts <br><br>The old days ;_;</br></br></br></br></br>  Alright anon's, while we still have a chance. Tell me how you picture the focal shift back to the boat to go.<br><br>I'm thinking it will be a falconia chapter focusing on rickert's new trouble and getting ready to leave for the wild unknown with silat. His thoughts wind up turning to guts and casca and the final page is a massive spread of pic related overlayed with rickert's thoughts on where they might have ended up since he last saw them.</br></br>  <br>Nice. Some lines are rather off, though.</br>  <br>compared to what? the translation of a translation stitched together by random anons?<br><br>personally i trust this one more.</br></br></br>  <br>SK.net translation.</br>  Shit Falconia looks like a paradise. If griffith wants to sacrifice it all nobody with a right mind can say that Griffith did nothing wrong  So is this all going to amount to Dressrosa Berserk version? Rip down the false paradise to show the seedy underbelly (with 900% more death and rape)? Coming in 2043.  <br>I think Rakshas is working alone. <br><br>Rickert isn't a threat to Griffith and I doubt he would order to kill him. <br>Locus couldn't really order Rakshas to do something because they are equal. Maybe he nicely asked him or something.</br></br></br></br>   I have been rejected  <br> Time to rape somebody </br>  <br> seedy underbelly <br>Nothing indicates that.</br></br>  <br>All the apostles barely placated by fighting each other, who will all go on a rampage at the slightest means?</br>  <br>hue</br>    <br>Besides the monster that old monster dude keeps, besides they are gathering all the humans for a great sacrafice, propably to bring the rest of the god hand to this plane.</br>  <br> they are gathering all the humans for a great sacrafice </br>  <br>Yes it seems falconia is truly paradise. Our heroes are turning into villains and our villains are turning into heroes. Guts is fucked.</br>  <br>Common, it's the only reason the apostles are doing this</br>  <br>What is Gaiseric's united Empire?</br>  I like how arab dude saved the day.<br>Man... I remember when he first showed up... 13 years ago or something.</br>  <br> barely placated by fighting each other <br> barely placated <br>Why barely? Stop making things up. <br> will all go on a rampage at the slightest means <br>Source? <br><br><br>Why would they want to sacrifice the humans of Falconia? <br> propably to bring the rest of the god hand to this plane <br>Why would Griffith want to do that? And I'm sure they are already there. They don't need physical bodies anymore like Griffith.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was 7 at the time.</br>  <br>Yeah it's not really an underbelly when it's in plain sight</br>  <br>We don't know anything about his empire and why was it destroyed.</br>  <br>The rape that will follow will be glorious</br>  <br>Because it was part of there plan Griffith could still be a pawn in all this</br>  <br>I don't know. <br>Silat seems pretty keen toward knowing griffith secret. <br>Maybe if Silat learns griffith secret, something would change.I bet if some one would introduce griffith as an demon or some sort, I would generally cause panic within the city, afterall, the city is pretty new.</br></br></br>  <br>They are doing this because of their own free will to serve Griffith/Femto.</br>  <br> Why would they want to sacrifice the humans of Falconia? <br><br>World domination, Griffith always sacrifices what he haves so he can grasp more and more. <br><br>You are an idiot if you think he will sit in Falconia with a thumb up his ass when there is a whole world to conquer. You think those giant steelworks churning out cannons are for show?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>looking back on this scene, the only reason Locus brought Rickert down there was to threaten him not to start shit with Griffith during his meeting right?<br><br>He arranged it once he realised Rickert was an original hawk and likely had some idea of what Griffith had done. Even questions him on in on the way.</br></br></br>  <br>That would be a terrible twist. And for all we know they are equal.</br>  <br>Really? I don't think they would put up with dealing with humans much longer. Their food, probably creating a farm of humans to feast on.</br>  <br>Kentaro Miura just wanted a random irrelevant character to receive attention.</br>  It would be nice if this series could actually finish. I'd even be fine if he just cut down on his art quality by like 50% just so he can consistently put it out without having to give up on his idols.  <br> his dream is a castle <br> he achieved it and now his city is literally a paradise <br> he will sacrifice it for... world domination? except there is no other castle as perfect as this one in the whole world  <br>Makes sense.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He is one of my favourite designs.</br>  <br>Griffith doesn't favor apostles over humans. He can probably destroy all of them quite easily if they start some shit.</br>  <br>Wild card, bitch.</br>  So can he only sacrifice Falconia because it belongs to him? Couldn't he sacrifice the entire rest of the world instead?<br><br>Also how's Guts (a broken old man with no special ability whatsoever other than having fate resistance) supposed to win against something akin to a God with a mountain of monsters on command and a behelit the size of a city?<br><br>I mean if just sacrificing the band of the hawk gave him so much power, what'll happen when he does so to an entire nation?</br></br></br></br>  Ok, who is going to sacrifice falconia?<br>Rickert or guts?<br>One of them is going to do it for sure.<br>The apostle wishes are always a monkey paw thing and griffith got his by sacrificing his merry band of men.<br>This whole thing is a red flag. Someone is going to end up using a behelith and turn that whole city into medieval auschwitz.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Really, he sure didn't mind sacrificing his friends to become femnto</br>  <br> his dream is a castle <br><br>Wow, you are fucking retarded. The caste is a metaphor, it's unreachable that's the whole point. <br><br>Griffith is the King of Longing, the point of his character is that he is never satisfied and always chases an ephemeral dream.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cut down on the art </br>  based Silat and the tapasa. What secret does rickert have beyond knowing what Griffith did to become a god hand and the monster fighting pit?  <br> Couldn't he sacrifice the entire rest of the world instead? <br>Then there would be nothing to conquer <br><br> Also how's Guts supposed to win <br>Idea is bound to the peoples unconscious mind, if the people want or even fear that Guts could kill Griffith then Guts will kill Griffith</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> if he just cut down on his art quality </br>  <br> it's unreachable that's the whole point <br>But he just reached it. There is no reason for him to kill anymore. <br> Griffith is the King of Longing <br>Nope. Never stated anywhere. <br> the point of his character is that he is never satisfied <br>Really? It certainly didn't seem that way.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually the entire world was already sacrificed by the Egg Apostle. He sacrificed the old world to create the new perfect one.</br>  <br>I just realized the symbolism, the ones who are staring into the fire are the deceased, the ones looking away are among the living, but while Guts has his sanity (hence he's looking right at Rickert), Caska is looking away from the light and into the dark where there's Griffith, who is a shadow of who he once was, or a husk, but is still looking at Rickert.</br>  <br>The fact that Griffith is a god hand to begin with? Can't be humanity's savior, if you're part of the hell leader club.</br>  <br> but is still looking at Rickert. <br>Nah, he's staring at Guts</br></br>  <br>Oh shus child, you think the metaphorical castle on the hill was meant literally <br><br>Why would Griffith go out of his way to kill Flora if he just wanted a castle? <br><br> Nope. Never stated anywhere.  <br><br>It's advised to actually read the manga you want to discuss</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But according to Berserk Hell is the most human thing in the world. It perfectly represents human nature.</br>  <br> Nope. Never stated anywhere. <br><br>you have to read the words silly.</br></br></br>  Is this the giant-water-snake-riding sorcerer?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Yes Daiba <br><br>The monster in the shed is Garuda, his mount</br></br></br>  <br>Okay, my bad. Still, this term was used once in the whole manga. Wanting more power it's not something Griffith wants.<br> Why would Griffith go out of his way to kill Flora if he just wanted a castle? <br>Good question, why? <br><br>And why would he sacrifice his perfect city to rule a completely destroyed world? You know that Falconia is the only safe city on Earth and all other cities are probably already in ruins.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>been a while</br>  <br>Is this the giant-dragon-sword-wielding warrior?</br>  <br> Wanting more power it's not something Griffith wants. <br>It's not about power, it's about conquest. Griffith could have killed Ganishka at any time, but he put on the entire war charade because he longs for conquest. <br><br> Still, this term was used once in the whole manga <br>Wrong again see <br><br> Good question, why? <br>Because he wants to conquer the world and magic users are more dangerous to him then armies</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Where is Zodd right now? He probably despises being in Falconia.  <br>You're dumb.</br>  <br>I'm sure the folks who'll get brutally murdered and devoured by monsters will appreciate that notion of yours.</br>   Griffith wants to assault the Elfhelm because of the mages living here <br> Rickert and Silat are encountering Daiba, they figure out the plans of Griffith <br> Rickert wants to stop him, he and Silat mention Guts in their conversation and Daiba knew where he was seen last time <br> they sneak onto the warship and travel to the island, reuniting with Guts there </br></br></br>  <br> but he put on the entire war charade because he longs for conquest. <br>Or rather because he wanted to merge the worlds and bring back a legendary city that was destroyed 1000 years ago. <br><br> Wrong again see <br>Two times in the same context. <br><br>But he can already conquer the whole world. Why would he sacrifice Falconia for this?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aparently there is no heaven. Just hell, which is really depressing.</br>  <br>Why are all the manga I like in "boring arc that goes nowhere limbo" and how did that happen?</br>  <br>Or rather Hell in Heaven are the same place.</br>  <br>Oh god please be true!</br>  <br>Have you ever considered the possibility that  life on earth  is purgatory?</br>  <br>Yeah i see something like this happening too, though Daiba still has Garuda locked up in his shed so they might just use that to bail instead.<br><br>Luca and Erica will probably be useful during that time as well.</br></br></br>  <br>I think that I died long ago and a lifetime of 4Chan is my punishment.</br>  <br>Which is really depressing! All it is is suffering. Fuck god is a beating heart of evil. Why is there no counter balance to this guy? <br>Well you wouldn't die if you are in purgatory</br></br>  God i really hope Daiba will become the member of Guts' group.<br>They really need a powerful black mage and he has a funny personality on top of it.</br>  <br>Schierke and Flora seem to imply there's a few rare alternatives depending on ones own "karma".</br>  <br> Why would he sacrifice Falconia for this? <br>Again because he wants admiration to captivate and own. It's not about using brute force to simply subjugate everything a grandiose play must be enacted with Griffith as the main role <br><br>Why are the steelworks working day and night to create weapons of war? Because Falconia will be used to conquer the world, first they will fight for him then he will sacrifice them to create his new world <br><br>This process will repeat ad infinitum because Griffith is the King of Longing</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Well you wouldn't die if you are in purgatory <br>Who says it wont loop. Time is a flat circle after all.<br>Being threatened with finity while constantly suffering is also kinda harsh.</br></br></br>  <br> 3 mages in one party </br>  <br> You really saved my bacon <br> How long have you been standing there just chewing the fat <br><br>What the fuck are you doing EG?</br></br></br></br>  <br>God I hope so, looks like there are other spirits besides apostles</br>  <br>he and Azan can complain about being surrounded by young people.</br>  <br>Then that would be hell, since nothing would change, purgatory is just a place of not good but not bad</br>  <br>I think it's more complex that that. <br><br> why is there no counter balance to this guy <br>Because humans are inherently evil. In some way the apostles are more human that other humans. They are entities rejecting social norms and following their instinct and desires.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What about the humans that are inherently good. I mean they do exist in this world just far in between.</br>  <br> assault has failed thanks to mages doing some really overpowered shit which obliterates the Griffith's forces on top of Guts hulking out and murdering a shitton of Apostles <br> people will start to question Griffith and doubt the bright future of their kingom, some internal conflict will start to grow, maybe the info about the source of the apostle's power will become known along with the fact of Griffith's betrayal and true nature <br> he will ends up sacrificing his own kingdom to start everything anew </br></br></br>  <br>There are other entities in the deep layers of the world <br><br>Idea is not the only one</br></br></br>  <br> one can only use a basic protection spell <br> another is a white mage <br>They need a black mage.</br></br></br>  <br>Nice fanfiction. <br><br> Why are the steelworks working day and night to create weapons of war? <br>Because it's a pretty dangerous world and he wants to save more people. <br> Because Falconia will be used to conquer the world <br>There isn't much left to conquer. <br> to create his new world <br>This is his new world.<br> This process will repeat ad infinitum <br>I'm sure soon most people outside of Falconia will be dead.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Daiba will do a combo attack with Schierke to summon some really powerful astral being to help the party <br> Daiba will finally accept that young people can be bright and promising </br></br>  <br>But the very next page shows that the abyss resides in the deepest central later, and idea even further. So in time everything is destined to drift into it.</br>  <br>Time in Berserk is a spiral nigga.</br>  <br>I just can't. I can't believe Judeau and co. are all suffering in the vortex of Dark Souls™. They deserve to be in a vortex of heaven, if there is one.</br>  <br>It's the deepest layer, though.</br>  <br><br>So it's kind of like the warp from warhammer.</br></br>  <br> Nice fanfiction. <br>That really means nothing from somebody who thinks Griffith's dream was having a literal castle and doesn't even know Griffiths proper tittle <br><br> There isn't much left to conquer. <br>Except for the entire Kushan homeland for one, not to mention Elfhaim</br></br></br></br></br>  I really hate Griffith but the dissonance between his design and the beauty of falconia and the truth of his lack of compassion is really one of the best parts of Berserk.  <br> I can't believe Judeau and co. are all suffering in the vortex of Dark Souls <br><br>Branded people end up in the vortex, there is no escaping it.</br></br></br>  So at which point Guts will fight against an army of apostles forcing the armor to consume him to the point he becomes an astral being like Skull Knight?<br>It's bound to happen.</br>   There's still people thinking that Skull Knight is Gaiseric while it was Boid all along   <br>i hope he doesn't completely become an ally without a lot of explaining, because if i remember correctly he was responsible for creating the edgiest thing in berserk history.</br>  <br> Kushan homeland <br>Why do you think it still exist? The light engulfed the whole Earth.</br></br>  <br>I hope the very first thing we see is a close panel of gut's boots stepping out of the ship.</br>  <br> bunch of Apostles sewn together in eternal agony <br><br>Pretty sure he would get Guts approval for that</br></br></br>  <br>Still makes little sense but Fuck end game guts fights god after he is given a chance to become an apostle. Gets taken down the spiral to meet god where he begins to slash</br>  <br> edgy <br>can you fucks stop calling anything macabre or portraying genuine evil "edgy"?</br></br>  <br>He lacks morals but given what happened to his emperor he can probably ally himself with the party.<br>Not like everyone in Guts' party is innocent. Certain little girl loved to burn people alive.</br></br>  <br>Because the light doesn't swallow up continents?</br>  <br>I wonder, do we know whether there are actually angels or other good high beings at the level of God Hand in Berserk? It's been a while. I know they talked about god somewhere in the first 100 chapters.</br>  <br>That's literally impossible.</br>  <br> angels or other good high beings at the level of God Hand in Berserk <br><br>Guts is just about to meet one on Elfhaim<br><br>Other then that there are benevolent elemental entities that grant people their protection</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorta like life, huh?</br>  <br> after he is given a chance to become an apostle <br>More like armor transforms him into the astral being.<br>He also can use behelit on dragon slayer, making it capable of space and time altering.</br></br></br>  <br>What does this even mean? The light even swallowed some small islands on the ocean. For all we know the monsters appeared everywhere.</br>  <br>Well their are those Astral spirits that magi talk to, when faced with what is what, the angels don't have wings and the Devils are apostles. You can give any creature that name if it's a higher power.</br>  So where is everyone's favorite skull?<br>Is he injured, running around or waiting at elfhelm for guts and his crew?</br>  <br>Meh guts is the impossible, he live outside of fate. He does what he wants</br>  <br>Hel tsun it up like farneese.</br>  <br> For all we know the monsters appeared everywhere. <br><br>And the Kushan have been shown to be adept at magic. So what the fuck is your point? You think the entire world outside Falconia is dead?</br></br></br>  <br>That works</br>  <br>Killing Apostles, forging an even bigger sword</br>  <br>Nigga is able to hop through space, he can be anywhere.</br>  Now exploitable in HQ  <br>i don't anything approaches godhand levels because they are (literally) the hand of the god behind everything.<br><br>But keep in mind the godhand have no physical bodies within the "real" world and rely on avatars which seem like they could easily be knocked back by some of the spirits we've already seen.<br><br>But actually disabling them is something only the sword of actuation could do. And only because it turns the complete insanity of the abyss against them by dumping them in the middle of it to be ripped apart.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't live outside of fate. <br><br><br> The Kushans <br>Only Daiba. He was the only Kushan sorcerer. And it seems like he was using only Ganishka's magic and his familiars. <br><br> You think the entire world outside Falconia is dead? <br>Not yet. But there is no reason to conquer lands infested with monsters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not that anon but<br>Why would Griffith want the kushan homeland? If it's worry about them retaliation they pose no threat to him because he literally has their whole army under his command and Griffith doesn't want the world he just wanted to be king of his own nation</br></br>  <br> But there is no reason to conquer lands infested with monsters. <br>Conquest is it's own reward dummy, that's the entire point<br><br>There was no reason to create Falconia in the first place othern then Griffith's desire</br></br></br></br>  <br> Griffith doesn't want the world he just wanted to be king of his own nation <br>Your understanding of Berserk is so childlike its hilarious</br></br>  <br>Fixed.</br>  <br>But there was. It wasn't only Griffith's desire. The Perfect World was the desire of all people in Albion and we can safely assume that it was the desire of the whole humanity. <br><br>I agree that Fantasia is just the first step to achieve that, but I really doubt Griffith will ever sacrifice it.</br></br></br>  <br>Griffith is absolutely unforgivable. Getting your comrades killed is bad enough, but condemning them to hell? And he still doesn't feel a thing?</br>  <br>Hell in Berserk world isn't that bad.</br>  <br>Being alive in the Berserk world seems like hell to be honest.</br>   "I wonder if falconia has penicillin shots"   <br>He's stopping at MACCY DS FROM THE NINTH DIMENSION</br>  <br> but I really doubt Griffith will ever sacrifice it. <br>He sacrificed the band while still human<br><br>Now as Femto he doesn't give two shits about sacrificing people</br></br></br></br>   There will never be adequate r34 of the whores   <br>All the more reason why a sacrifice would be useless. It has to mean something.</br>  <br><br>Miura is a fucking god when it comes to his artistry.</br></br>  <br> He sacrificed the band while still human <br>Because they were his stepping stones. <br><br> he doesn't give two shits about sacrificing people <br>So he can't sacrifice them. And why would he even sacrifice them? He is the most powerful being on Earth.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>For as long as it's been since they've gotten on the boat, something completely concrete that solidifies they're actually getting off on Elf Island would be best. I like the boots suggestion.</br></br></br>  <br>We know that everybody was sacrificed and had the brand on them.</br>  <br>Skull knight says he's the man who lives out site of fate .</br>  <br><br> And why would he even sacrifice them <br><br>Because he gets his ass handed to him by the unified Elves-Guts-Mage front? <br><br>Because a narrative of sacrifice is required for his ego? <br><br>Because the complete transformation of the world requires it?<br><br>To usher in the 1000 years of darkness?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Rickert learning all the city strengths and weaknesses for inevitable war <br><br>He will be a very useful party member.</br></br>  <br>I dislike his analogy tbh, in the end a dumb fish in a pond will neither change the pond nor the moons reflection of the pond</br>  <br>He's useful thanks to his gadgets already.<br>He can do a fucking machinegun crossbows in the age where anything but sword and board is extremely rare.</br></br>  <br>Griffith is good they say.<br>Bullshit.</br></br>  <br>I can't stop seeing him as Tommy Wiseu.</br>  The point is that guts is going to sacrifice either caska or falconia.<br>Caska because shes super important to him, falconia because crushing griffiths dream is super important to him too.</br>  <br>He needs to give Guts some new tech. Guts seems to have stopped using crossbows after getting the berserker armor. I'm thinking maybe a man-portable balista.</br>  <br>Why would Guts sacrifice anyone? He despises apostles and told Slan "he is human right down to the marrow of his bones"</br>  Considering that officially we aren't even supposed to know about the Idea of Evil I wolder when exactly will Miura re-introduce it. Honestly, I think that the first introduction with Griffith transformation was actually rather fitting in the story. Is Miura intending to change its place in the story? Or completely retcon its existence as a concept of conflict? Hell, I'm very interested.  <br>Can't even tell if really looks into the fire or to Rickert. <br>He died and revived with sanity.</br></br>  Does Griffith understand why he got bitch slapped? That fuck  <br><br>WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO LUCA'S FACE?!</br></br>  Reminder we will never get off the boat. <br>Don't even hope for it, don't even dream it.</br>  <br>If griffith isn't good (beneficial to society) the whole revenge vs forgiveness plotline loses all fucking meaning. On the one hand griffith's character is basically a child that hasn't learned you can't always get what you want so falconia needs to fail but on the other hand killing Griffith and destroying falconia needs to be a legitimately bad thing to do so that guts will hesitate whether he should do it and possibly do like akagi and chill the fuck out.</br>  <br> revenge vs forgiveness <br> forgiveness <br><br>The plotline is revenge vs moving on you numbskull, in both situations griffith is an asshole. But only one path drags Guts down with him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>there was a picture detailing the layering of Bererk's world and how those different layers ovelapped, I remember it being amde so each layer touched two others and no more, and a being from oen layer could only move between those it was touching<br><br>Does anyone still have it?</br></br></br>  <br>He never said that. <br><br><br>It's a perfect analogy. It means that Guts can't really change fate.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Guts won't sacrifice anything, that would go against the core of his character that has been established for literally decades worth of content.<br><br>He couldn't sacrifice Falconia either, that's not what a sacrifice is.<br> lel yeah just rek my enemy's shit for me, oh yeah make me a powerful demon too while you're at it <br>The point of the sacrifice is giving up something important to you, not achieving something important AND getting demon powers at the same time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the most powerful being on Earth <br> gets his ass handed to him by mere mortals <br>kek<br><br> Because the complete transformation of the world requires it? <br>Why do you think it requires another sacrifice?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It was probably the priest who sacrificed them.</br></br>  <br> dat scrub <br> most powerful being on Earth <br><br>Kek</br></br></br></br>  <br>Moving on implies forgiveness you dumb fuck. Just trying not to think about it won't put guts at ease, he needs to actually let go of the grudge so that he could honestly say he won't kill Griffith even if the opportunity presented itself. <br>Can't believe I actually have to type this out.</br></br>  <br>What? No.<br>Moving on isn't trying not to think about it. Moving on is excepting the world and realizing there are things you can't and shouldn't do no matter how good they would make you feel.<br><br>Not chasing after Griffith is the answer, but I see nothing wrong with striking at a neck that was placed in front of you.</br></br></br></br>  <br> moving on implies forgiveness <br>not necessarily<br>it could just imply that you realise that revenge in itself self-destructing and harmful to others in guts' case, since he'll drag them along in their battles</br></br></br>  <br> Moving on implies forgiveness you dumb fuck. <br>That's a Christian mindset that doesn't necessarily apply to the rest of the world.</br></br>  <br>Yah huh</br>  <br>do you seriously believe guts' only two options are accept griffith as his lord and saviour and congratulate him on the genius tactical decision of sacrificing his friends or spend the rest of his life hunting him down untill every bone in his body is broken and everyone he cared about has been killed along the way?<br><br>Have you forgotten entirely what Guts has been doing since the tower of conviction?<br><br>He can hate griffith as much as he wants, just as long as he doesn't let that hate destroy everything he worked so hard to recover.</br></br></br></br></br>  I really believe Zodd is going to end up betraying Griffith in favor of Guts. Guts pairing up with Zodd to beat the Emperor felt %100 more natural than Zodd acting as a gloried carriage for Griffith. I think Guts will cut off Zodd's other horn in battle and make him question his loyalty.  <br>Isn't already there against his will. He only joined because he lost.</br>  <br>The thing is if you gain Zodd's "favour" it just means he wants to keep coming at you until one of you dies.</br>  <br><br>Im not EG - I just posted a link to his scans</br></br>  A lot of people joke about how Miura will die before he finishes Berserk, but what these people don't realize is that Miura doesn't want to finish Berserk. He doesn't care about it anymore. He's writing side arcs that have virtually no significance on the story. He's procrastinating in releasing chapters. This all signifies a lack of desire to finish this series.<br>What we need is a new author to basically pick up the slack. Problem is, I can't really think of any good ones that have the same kind of style.</br>  <br>Zodd is kind of a pussy for surviving as long as he did when I think about it. If he really wanted to fight strong opponents he could've just fucked with the other apostles.</br>  <br>never<br>that's the point, he doesn't have to become what skull knight became<br>wouldn't be surprised if he never even kills femto</br></br></br>  <br>Hey wasn't the new release supposed to be like 4 chapters in one go and like a hundred pages?</br>  <br>Apparently the apostles aren't hardcore enough for him.<br><br>Makes sense seeing as if Wyald is anything to go by, most apostles lack any real combat training and rely solely on inhuman reflexes to win fights. I'm sure people likes Guts and Skullknight with refined technique offer much better fights.</br></br></br>  <br>I think zodd has a human over coming monsters fetish like alucard. He was far less receptive to giffith cutting his horn as god then cutting him as a man. He probably only gives skully a pass because all that he has been threw and the honorable warrior thing.</br>  <br>Then guts will bring griffith into a position where he sacrifices falconia.<br>I just cant believe that this city will stand and not be some horrible kind of trap for everyone inside it</br></br>  <br>Man the sad thing is that this might be true.<br><br>With Jojo Araki managed to keep the rhythm going this long by changing the cast and setting every so often so it didn't get old for him or something.<br><br>I guess it's too late for Miura to really do that so he's stuck in a corner</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> threw <br>I fucked up</br></br>  <br>the previous 4 were the chapters that had been released, but not compiled into a volume yet. Just to get people up to speed in case they forgot during the hiatus. So nothing new.</br>  <br>The shit people just pull out of their ass here just amazes me.</br>   remember all those theories we made ten years ago on /a/ about where berserk is going to go  <br> the plot hardly advanced <br>just let it go</br></br>  <br>It was a different situation. He instantly knew that he couldn't so much as touch Griffith.</br>  How long do you think Miura will be able to keep up the monthly publication?<br><br>Or is an actual, factual deadline the only thing he needed to push himself to actually work on the manga?</br></br>  <br> How long do you think Miura will be able to keep up the monthly publication? <br>Approximately 5-10 months, then he has to start brainstorming again for new chapters. Nothing unusual.</br></br>  <br>Are you fucking serious?</br>  <br> he wasn't in the daily berserk threads  <br><br>Kek kys newfag</br></br></br>  <br>He's probably thinking of fighting.</br>  <br> Berserk is monthly <br> Best hooker will be back. <br>This is just a dream right?</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe he's feeling like he has something to lose now.</br>  wow, Kentaro Miura is as shit as Saki Hasemi now, what the fuck.  <br> my feet hurt <br> I wonder what Guts is doing right now </br></br>  <br>I want him to spend three pages showing everybody on the boat, with sweeping views of the ocean in back. The 4th page then flips the perspective 180 and shows that the boat was actually already moored in elfheim's port</br>  <br>No. He just reduced his pace from "insane to the point where he literally worked himself nearly to death" to something more normal, and more healthy for himself. And uses that to brainstorm how to progress the story, recharge his batteries, go out and have some relationship with other mangakas, make some research, think up new characters, rethink about if what he planned before really makes sense and if it might not be better to change that, looking back at what he wrote so as to not contradict himself, interact with his assistants, draw some drafts, perhaps rejecting them for not being what he would like them to be, making new drafts, and all that shit. <br><br>Just normal stuff.</br></br></br>   This arguing about if Griffith wants more power or not <br><br>Did we all just forget he is a demon god? when was the last time they were just satisfied with what they have?</br></br>  <br><br> Miura doesn't want to finish Berserk <br><br>Of course he does.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Griffith sacrifices falconia for a guts dakimakura </br>  <br>This.<br> demon godlike titled the King of Longing <br> not wanting more, forever </br></br></br>  <br> it could just imply that you realise that revenge in itself self-destructing and harmful to others in guts' case <br>It is kinda what keeps him alive.</br></br>  <br> august 28th <br>Fuck yeah</br></br>  <br>What if he is the strongest of them all?</br>  I just love how berserk's style seems to be inspire in those old medieval illustrations.<br><br>Is there any better name for this style than medieval illustration?</br></br>  <br>dank</br>  <br> Idea is not the only one <br>He's not the only one but Idea controls all humans. What's actually fucking trippy to me is that IoE doesn't control humans in a deterministic way, it does it on a subconsicous level, affection lower emotions. Meaning that everyone has free will but is guided towards a specific path. And the funniest part is that everything non-human is likely out of IoE's control. Yet it is able to accurately and perfectly make shit happen all while following the laws of physics.<br><br>That's a level of control that boggles my mind.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Unless "King of longing" is a reference to a mythological figure which I'm embarrassingly ignorant of, taken literally a "king of longing" could just as easily mean a person doomed to always fail to obtain the object of longing instead of always getting it and then wanting something more.</br>  <br> http://bato.to/read/_/334914/berse<wbr>rk_v38_ch338_by_evil-genius</wbr> <br>it wasnt supposed to be a 100 page update?</br></br>  <br>Good guess but it's actually foreshadowed in the story.<br>Remember Sonia's prophecy. She said that Zodd would have to chose. Either become a warrior or a beast to the person who wounded him. Obviously this prophecy has been fulfilled but there is a double interpretation to it. <br><br>Griffith was also the person who wounded him in that Castle where we first see Zodd. He cut off his arm.<br>Zodd acted like a warrior and worked with Guts, but I think that Zodd will eventually act like a beast and fight against Griffith in favor of Guts.<br><br>The reasoning I have is that an army will be formed to destroy Falconia in the future. Zodd will likely be bored and rather than help Griffith, he's going to switch side to fight against the greatest army in the world in the most legendary battle of all time.<br>Zodd already stated that Griffith is the only person worthy to serve and he has the entire army of the Vatican. It would be the only time he could enjoy himself to the fullest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You literally cannot want more when you have the greatest utopia in the world.<br>Like, what the fuck else do you aspire to reach?</br></br>  <br>White-line woodcut or pre-Dürer Master Print would probably be the most appropriate name.</br>  <br><br>HEY GRIFFITH HOW COME YOUR MOM LETS YOU HAVE -TWO- GREATEST UTOPIA'S IN THE WORLD?</br></br>  <br>YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE COOL? THREE UTOPIAS!</br>  Hey /a/, I'm trying to get my friend into reading berserk, but he's reading it off mobile apps bc he can't find any good online scans. I'm afraid he's not gonna appreciate the amazing artwork from his phone, can anyone name me a good site for him to read it from?  <br>No one gives a fuck about you or your friend, use google and fuck off.</br>  <br>the entire world</br>  <br> He just reduced his pace from "insane to the point where he literally worked himself nearly to death" to something more normal, and more healthy for himself. <br>Are you telling me that Miura was given the same number of pages and deadlines as other mangakas of similar age and 'rank' in his magazine and that the high quality and level of detail of his drawings was only made possible because he worked himself to death, rather than because he was given more lucrative working conditions?</br></br>  <br>The entire world has turned to shit. No one would ever want the entire world when you have the best place in the world where monsters don't eat you for miles.</br>  <br>for some reason I get the feeling he moonlights as loli ero mangaka using a different style.</br>  I'll post this in every berserk thread until you like it!  <br>he could be anyone, man now i'm getting paranoid</br>  <br>mangasee</br>   I liked this chapter   <br> using a different style. <br>does that actually happen though?</br></br>  <br>I fucking adore Miura's linework. He's so based.</br>  I think miura said the ending to berserk was going to be bitter sweet<br>what do you think that implies?</br>  <br>It has something to do with Casca.</br>  <br>Guts will win but he'll be rehatded as villain. He and Casca die, but somewhere on the way they were able to find a way for branded souls to enter some sort of paradise instead of stewing in a hell dimension.</br>  <br>*hated</br>  <br>what about guts does end up in hell but he still kicks ass and takes names down there.</br>  <br>Everyone sees Rickerts dick.</br>  <br>That would be horrible. What is good about Guts not even having peace after death? Why do you want him to suffer for eternity?</br>  <br>world gets saved, evil is defeated, everyone gets a happy ending except for Guts and Casca who sacrifice themselves to keep Griffith locked with them in eternal combat in the warp or something.</br>  <br>Guts rapes Femto and everything seems to be fine, Casca is healed and blabla, then OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE Guts accidentally steps on Puck and he uses the Bejelit to become the strongest apostle who ever appeared sacrificing the rest of the group minus Guts and Casca. He then proceeds to become new demon elfking</br>  <br>because he's the struggler</br>  Is Skull Knight as strong as a God Hand ?  <br>I'm not sure honestly. I mean he seems to be a badass, that's for sure, but every time we've seen him trying to do something to one of them he either barely got considered or got rused hard.</br>  <br>Berserk will have a Getter Valhalla ending<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9QX<wbr>RvC6v9eg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Ahahahaha<br><br> __________no </br></br></br>  <br> 128618054 <br>will Locus betray Griffith?</br></br>  <br>Hell in Berserk was not some fire and brimstone place where you physically walk around and get poked by horned red people with a forked tail and goatlegs, but a giant sea of souls where you're just a drop of consciousness slowly dissolving into nothing over a very long time, together with all the other consciousness from other people whining about why their life sucks, how their feet hurt, how they didn't want to die, how it's unfair that they're dead, how they hate having been eaten by crocodiles, how being raped by trolls sucks, and all that shit. <br><br>In short, it's like 4chan and tumblr and reddit combined on their worst days, everyone only posts about their feelz, no funny reaction images to at least distract you, you have to read all of it, and you can't ever log off.</br></br></br>  <br>That's no real answer to the questions.</br>  <br>nope and after that space warping shit void and femto pulled on him, they could probably kill him at any time.</br>  <br>But maybe it's because it's 5 vs 1 when they meet ? I meant 1 vs 1</br>  <br>well no one ever seemed to interfere if I remember correctly. When he tried to hit Void the latter didn't even move an inch and reflected his attack with temporal mirrors shenanigans. If they had gangbanged him I would see your point, but I never even recall Ubik and Conrad doing anything combat-wise and Slan acting while Skully was around. It's been a while since I last read it though, so I may be mistaken</br>  <br>Yeah, the God Hand are overpowered as fuck. That is why I don't understand why Griffith came back to the human world trying to build some sort of kingdom (which was his original dream ofc) while he has the power to impose it through sheer power. Is he just having fun ? Is it all meaningless to him ?</br>  <br>spatial*</br>  <br>he's strong enough for them not to be able to oneshot him but like all he can really do is meddle with their plans and not really kill them outright, the last time he tried with Femto it ended up fucking up hard.</br>  <br>Void and Femto are probably stronger than Slan, Konrad and Ubik. Doesn't mean that they're easy to handle, however.</br>  <br>He was just mad as fuck at rickert because griffith showed him some semblance of respect.<br>So he asked drapeguy to kill him.<br>He obviously wants to suck Griffiths dong.</br></br></br>  <br> and Femto <br><br>I can see Void because he gives off the impression of the leader and he might actually be the boss of the gang, but what of the other threes? Why should Femto be stronger than them? I mean of course he's been more important to us and to the story so far but I don't see how a comparison between their power can be done as of yet</br></br></br>  <br>Guts will destroy his body from overuse of the Berserker armor.<br>He will finally kill Griffith but will be told that he will have to wait 1000 years for a new messiah to be born and bring down the God Hand. Basically, Guts will have to do the same shit Skull Knight has been doing for 1000 to finally finish his revenge.<br><br>That's the bittersweet ending I see in Berserk.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Everything Femto does furthers Evil for its own sake. He's a being made of Evil.</br>  <br> Getter <br>is that the series what gurren laggan was parodying?</br></br>  Someone mentioned in the last thread about how Miura can't write women. What's the deal behind that?  I wish we had flashbacks of how the 4 others became God Hand, and how Skull Knight became what he is today (although we got a glimpse of it, king of blabla).  So can Zodd not put his horn back on now or is it a sign of servitude?  <br> Void and Femto are probably stronger than Slan, Konrad and Ubik. <br>We don't know that. Though their powers are fucking bullshit.<br><br>Femto can effectively push anything from his direction and condense anything to a ball. He can also warp space time. That's pure bullshit.<br><br>Void has only shown to be able to open up astrals (like that black dot villain from Spiderman) meaning there's no possible way to attack Void in any way.<br><br>The God Hand are OP as fuck in a realistic universe.<br><br><br>He can't write *powerful* women. All the women are well written. They're emotionally driven, weak, always clinging to men and always getting raped. <br>Basically a very accurate portrayal of women.<br><br><br>It was cut in his dream. You can retreave something that not dropped in the physical world.<br>Or perhaps by switching back to his Human looking form, you seal the wound and can't put it back again. Who knows.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who cares about Zodd, seriously. He's an asspull.</br>  <br>I like it to be left like this, very mysterious and up to one's imagination to a certain extent. I'd like some hints, but nothing more than that.</br>  <br>Man I want all of the berserk history and lore to be fleshed out but it would take another twenty years at miura's pace. Not to mention people already complain when the story takes a detour to rickert and falconia.</br>  <br>Yamete, Baito-san.</br>  <br>I see Griffith sacrificing all the people to so he can become the next god. Kinda Fullmetal ending almost the same actually. I mean the bigger sacrafice better apostle? So people who already think you are a god some what then sacrificing them would turn femnto to mega femnto</br>  <br>It's just what their abilities are, which makes it more useful in a battle. Void's ability to open voids in space and redirect an opponent's attack against itself is hellishly brutal, and Femto's ability to warp space in a way to make himself literally untouchable or to compress it as to squeeze things into really really tiny blobs of flesh is very much the same. <br><br>The other three don't seem to be too combat-focused themselves. <br><br>That's just from the looks of it. Just because they might not be too combat-focused doesn't necessarily mean that they're weak.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>b-but noname you're forgetting about Luca<br><br>also yes, God Hand is broken as shit. While it does not look like a power devoted to fighting, Ubik opening temporal windows out of nowhere seems fucking absurd as well</br></br></br>  <br>honestly I like how the stronger female characters he makes tend to have motherly motivations for putting on a brave face (Luka towards the other whores, Caska to the rest of the band sorta) so it feels more natural than the typical STRONG WIMMINZ in a lot of media</br>  <br>I remember you trying to force this discussion in the one piece threads.</br>  <br><br>Why does Zodd actually think he's hot shit enough to consider Skully his rival?</br></br>  <br>tripfags like to shitpost to no end, more news at 11</br>  <br>also Flora, naturally expressing strong women in maternal roles is the best</br>  <br>Oh man, please this.</br>  <br>Even if they happen to not be on the same level, they're both still too many levels ahead of almost everyone else, so they're the closest they can conveniently get.</br>  <br>it's probably the latter really</br>  <br>Hahahahahahaha</br>  <br><br>I honestly thing that Skull knight knew Griffith was going to do that. His real target is Void, he knew that striking Griffith would fuck over the dimensional world and that is why he did it.</br></br>  <br>Given the choice, whether to rule a corrupted and failing empire<br>Or to challenge the fates for another throw, a better throw against one's destiny.<br>What was a king to do?</br></br></br>  <br>well he probably consistently loses to Skull Knight but doesn't die cause immortal, so the thought of fighting him is more exciting than bodying a bunch of scrub apostles</br>  <br>Remember when your average mugger was a normal human, and not a horrible monster from hell?<br>good times.</br></br>  <br>Remember when griffith was gonna be a great conqueror withouth all the bulltshit we are having now? Yeah? <br>Now look at gutts,he only wants revenge the only thing holding him now is caska. He is using the armor so how the fuck is that "human" ,in a few volumens we are gonna see him turn on a monster just for the sake of vengeance.</br></br>  <br>power creep</br>  <br>how would that affect Void in any way? Unless his keikaku involves Griffith letting the others acquire a physical body as well.  I honestly can't recall, they haven't done so yet, have they? </br>  <br> Remember when griffith was gonna be a great conqueror withouth all the bulltshit we are having now? <br>no because we already knew from the beginning he was going to betray guts and become a monster.</br></br>  <br> implying he isn't just sitting in a cave and whining about Causality </br>  <br> you're forgetting about Luca <br>I'm still clinging to the fact that Luca is controlled directly by IoE. Something about her really feels off somehow.<br>Same with Sonia.<br><br> Ubik opening temporal windows out of nowhere seems fucking absurd as well <br>Seriously. Fucking temporal time windows. And I'm sure he has more bullshit powers.<br>Just imagine if he can open up a window in the future. That would be pure fucking bullshit.<br> I can see from this temporal time window that you will do X and Y <br>I mean, seriously, how the fuck do you beat that?<br><br><br>Yes. With that new sword, I'm sure but he really fucking fucked up with Griffith. They saw his surprise attack miles away.<br>Some people say that he had planned to fail because it would bring Void to the physical world but it's still very much a stupid failure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That is exactly the point, he has drawn out the Godhand into the material world where they can finally be killed. All of them.</br>  <br><br>Griffith Internet Defence Force.</br></br>  <br> Moving on implies forgiveness <br>Oh hell no. I hope you haven't been thinking people have forgiven your autism just because they haven't been pissed off at you recently.<br><br>Putting something behind you and not dwelling in the past has nothing to do with forgiveness.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The slut demon posessed some guts and created a physical body if i'm not wrong.</br>  <br>The worlds have merged into one. Now the other three God Hand are also physically manifested in reality. <br><br>Together with all the other fantasy critters.</br></br></br>  <br>Then why didn't he sacrifice them right away?</br>  <br><br>Femto would have literally died here if he didn't have the Dread Emps to serve as a  sacrifice </br></br>  <br> I'm still clinging to the fact that Luca is controlled directly by IoE <br>Nah, she's just Slan's favourite</br></br>  <br>Hmm. It would be funny if true.<br>I'm still very cautious about Luca.</br></br>  <br>What? No, Femto wouldn't have died there.</br>  <br> always getting raped. <br>Well, in their universe I can see it as a common thing because monsters everywhere and village folk being run down all the time. Only time it made me scratch my head was with Casca during the eclipse. Struggling, fear, sure I get that. But why not rape everyone if that was the case? Of all the rapes, that one seemed the most unnecessary. Femto should have gotten to her first, not have sloppy seconds.<br><br><br>And you're trying to derail a Berserk one.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fucking jew-Ubik man. I'll be seriously disappointed if he doesn't end up getting some badass screentime sooner or later.<br><br> Ubik is about to get rekt <br> he opens up a temporal window into the future <br> SEE YOU MOTHERFUCKERS <br> he jumps in it <br><br><br>if they still possess their bullshit powers I hardly see that happening, but I see your point.<br><br><br>yes that's true, but killing her incarnation hardly had any effect on her right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it just made her waste a possesion since they're not able to materialise in the physical realm all that often.<br>Won't mean shit now that the two worlds have fused probably.<br>I bet she's the first apostle that guts will kill.</br></br></br>  <br> remember when I was second-in-command of the most powerful empire in the world? <br> now I clean up shit </br></br>  <br>This is much more funny if you read it from right to left.</br>  <br><br>He would have, it was either going to be him or dread emps acting as the gate.</br></br>  <br>for some reason I don't see Guts killing anyone of the God Hand, if not for Femto (and I have some doubts on that too)<br><br>Void belongs to Skully, but I can see the other threes not being targeted and minding their own business. Wonder what they're up to right now.<br><br> Void is contemplating reality while hanging like a bat somewhere <br> Slan is fucking like a rabbit <br> Conrad fucks people up with viruses and shit <br> Ubik randomly floats around allucinating people and driving people to insanity </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Casca wasn't raped by the apostles during the Eclipse. They did plan to do it, and probably did some light tug-of-war for who gets to rape her first, making sure to not accidentally rip her apart, but before it was finally decided who gets to do her first, Femto was born, and did his demonic droit du seigneur.</br>  <br>He made equivalent of Daemonculaba. So what? It's not nearly as fucked up as what Griffith have done.</br>  <br>Are you retarded</br>  <br>Femto was and is still untouchable because of his superspace-bending powers.</br>  <br>I think Guts wouldn't really care as long as the guy is useful to them and doesn't pull anything on his friends.</br>  <br><br><br>The thing about Berserk's metaphysics is that they're derived from actual occult practices, particularly with regards to theosophy.</br></br></br>  <br><br>If he was untouchable why did he need Dread Emps to tank that blow? And why did he have to wait for Skully to show up instead of ripping space himself to open the door?<br><br>Sword of Actuation seems like a very interesting device.</br></br></br></br>  I'm not even for Guts anymore, fuck him. Skull Knight all the way, Miura should make him the main character.  <br>Because it would imply that he first challenges them, but they're just annoyed and their reaction is telling him to move. Kinda thought it's more funny than the reverse, they telling Zodd to move and challenges them as a reaction.<br>Now I thought much more about this than I ever wanted, so screw you.</br></br>   Griffith sacrificing Falconia <br>What a dumb idea. It's dumb even from narrative point. <br>Falconia is the end goal. There won't be anything after Falconia. Miura has been establishing the similarities between Griffith and Gaiseric since volume 10. He won't throw it out of the window now. <br><br>Right now it's hard to tell if Griffith is just the next Gaiseric or the true "savior" of humanity. It's possible that the old imperfect capital was destroyed only to be resurrected as the perfect magical city one thousand years later.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Miura should make him the main character. <br><br> implying he's not Guts from the future </br></br></br>  <br>Of course it's read right to left<br><br>Thinking otherwise is what made you retarded</br></br></br>  <br>he does not hold that sword's power but he seems to be able to completely redirect its trajectory by warping space, which makes him seemingly invunerable to hit unless he decides to get struck (and why would he)</br>  <br>But he's spoopy.</br>  <br> (and why would he) <br><br>CAUSALITY my boy</br></br></br>  <br>Will god be pissed again and send down 4 or 5 angels to destroy it?</br>  <br>Go away Skull Knight<br><br> That's Gut's role </br></br></br>  <br> implying japs know metaphors </br>  Why does God only have one hand ? Is he fucking crippled ?  <br>Maybe he wants to become like IoE, and he needs all those souls of humans and apostles?</br>  <br> Implying God isn't the hand </br>    <br> Berserk <br> inviolable powerlevels </br></br>  <br>because  he's the guts from the future </br>  <br>He actually gets things done while he knows what's going on. Also he's surprisingly non hostile, which I really like.<br><br><br> mfw <br>I wouldn't even be mad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm willing to bet dosh that Guts will take care of some apostles.<br>Remember, his sword expelled the bitch in heat from the physical realm.<br>Considering what happened there killing femto will probably generate a nuclear explosion.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe Guts is a mudskipper.</br>  <br>FUCK</br>  <br>I see two scenarios:<br>Griffith is indeed just the next Gaiseric and his utopia will be destroyed in some way. But what about the Perfect World from Egg Apostle's wish? <br><br>Or Griffith is the real human messiah destined to create a perfect world. Falconians will be the sole survivors of the Age of Darkness and they will be stripped of free will (so they can't cause any trouble). Of course Guts will stop it. Nausicaa had a similar ending.</br></br></br></br>  <br>isn't it kind of his fault that the fantasia thing happened?</br>  <br>griffith would never sacrifice falconia<br>but it will be sacrificed by someone, maybe the god hand or idea of evil as some causality shenanigans</br></br>  <br>The fantasia thing is actually good for him in the end though, now the godhand are easier to reach</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Cu1<wbr>qFN4JqlE</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I need ideas for a new one</br></br></br>  <br><br>Isn't it pretty obvious that skully is Gaiseric?</br></br>  <br>Because  he's using the other one to fap </br>  <br><br>Third scenario:<br><br>Griffith starts a talent agency for singers and Guts becomes a manager to defeat him by outdoing him at this years Falconia idol competition</br></br></br></br>  <br>the first anon is joking, the second one seems legitimately retarded.

You never know with anons these days.<br><br> mfw </br></br></br>  <br> nofunallowed.jpg <br><br><br>Isn't the Qliphoth Hebrew or something? I remember it from Tales of the Abyss having a similar function it has here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>cheers</br>  <br>Friend Like Me starring Skull Knight</br>  <br>Yes.<br>Only possible alternative:<br>now, it has been a long while, so I'm not sure, but wasn't there some royal adviser/vizier or whatever who was with Gaiseric and was important? He's probably Void now, but as a twist he could be revealed as Skull Knight, with Void being Gaiseric.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Skull Knight was Gaiserics elf companion like Puck is to Guts.<br><br>This is why it seems like an empty suit of armour, because there's a tiny elf in there controlling all the switches.</br></br></br></br>  <br>now noname will scold you and make a several hundreds words post about gaiseric and the wise man.<br><br>Void is supposedly the imprisoned man, and Gaiseric the king, that turnaround would be cool but I don't see it happening</br></br></br>  <br>Because he had to be brought to the deepest ends of despair to awaken the Behelit. He had to be at his lowest to be able to use it. And so he did.<br>Which is the only reason why he would be ready to try to sacrifice Falconia if that would be his only way of bailing out from defeat by the hands of Guts.</br></br>  <br>The God Hand mockingly call the Skull Knight "his majesty" or king, so it's far more likely that the Skull Knight was Emperor Gaiseric than the priest/wise man who was tortured in the legends. <br><br>Also, exposed big brain and having eyes and mouth sealed shut seems to be a punishment that would be applied to somebody who thinks himself smarter. Like a wiseass sage or so.</br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't explain why gaiseric has remained for thousands of years. Is he just a branded one that has remained for some reason? Has being closer to the astral world given him everlasting life?<br>He does seem to hate Void so them being connected sounds about right.<br><br>I'd just stop reading if this was the case.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't see it happening <br>Me neither, but it's the only alternative to Gaiseric being Skully that's plausible.</br></br>  <br> I'd just stop reading if this was the case. <br><br> Skull Knight is seemingly defeated after an extended battle protecting elfland <br><br> his armour cracks open <br><br> a   skeleton jumps out and attacks </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I mean, seriously, how the fuck do you beat that? <br>Guts cuts the little fuck up when it turns out that he can't be predicted because he's outside their causality crap.</br></br>  <br>I think Gaiseric being Skully holds up pretty well on its own, it's a bit ambiguous but my guess is everyone with half a brain figured it out while reading Berserk for the first time.</br>  <br>fucking stop.</br>  So what do the god hand do all day anyway? Lay dormant until something happens? I can see Slan having darkness orgies day and night and making more abominations as her children impregnate her.  <br>the only thing that bothers me is, why did Puck think he was having an elf in front of him?</br>  <br>This makes higher chance, as the tortured man is at his lowest, therefore most likely to use Behelit.</br>  <br>He isn't outside their causality crap. Neither is Skull Knight.</br>  <br> They saw his surprise attack miles away. <br> Some people say that he had planned to fail because it would bring Void to the physical world but it's still very much a stupid failure. <br><br>Wait, WHY do people still assume Skull Knight failed? He's been going against the God Hand for over a thousand years, do you guys think he doesn't know about them?<br><br>Femto notes at the moment that he seems to show up during 'temporal junctions' in the flow of fate.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The God Hand are almost certainly going to die by the end of the series. They've kind of been set up for it since the earliest chapters. From the very first time we saw Hell, they were presented in a sort of "this is Guts' goal" way.</br></br>  <br>No, he said that his aura felt similar as to that of an elf. <br><br>The Skull Knight was most likely the former wearer of the Berserker armor, having bled himself to death while using it. And since that armor was made by magical fairy beings, it makes sense that Puck would feel something fairy-ish about the Skull Knight.</br></br></br>  <br> Ciresiag <br> Schierke <br> In any way similiar </br></br></br>  <br><br>How do you pronounce Schierke then?<br><br>protip: you can't</br></br></br></br>  <br> The Name of the emperor was Gaiseric, he wore a skull armor.  <br> You know, like a skull <br> SKULL ARMOR <br>You must be braindead to miss the hints Miura was trying to give.</br></br></br></br>  <br>In a way a German would do it, obviously. Once you know German spelling, it becomes easy.</br>  <br>that was my point my dear sarcastic anon</br>  <br><br> Monthly <br><br>you know he's going to release a couple of chapters and take the new year off again right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Most likely? He literally said "I used to wear that armor"<br>And i'm pretty sure it was made by dwarves or something.<br><br>Sch-ierke<br>think german.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't it made by dorfs?</br>  <br>So, if this is monthly and stays monthly  kek  what is the probability that the series will finish in time?</br>  <br>The german way<br>It's easy</br></br>  <br>I know. I just wanted to make clear how obvious it was.</br>  <br>Sheerkeh.</br>  <br>Sure. <br>Dwarves are magical fairy beings. And that's before D&amp;D and Warhammer Fantasy decided to make dwarves antimagical axe-miners with scottish accents that can't stop drinking beer.</br></br>  <br> Isn't it pretty obvious that skully is Gaiseric? <br>mind=blown</br></br>  <br><br>Qliphoth is derived from Kabbalah, which is indeed Jewish mysticism, but Berserk's usage of the term is entirely different.<br><br>In Kabbalah's cosmology, the world is essentially an "emanation" of an absolute fundamental principle, "God." God in Kabbalah is not an anthropomorphic being, but an underlying eternal concept from which the whole works of creation sprung that is beyond individual human comprehension, very similar to Hinduism's Brahman or, in a more tangible capacity, the Dao (in Daoism). Essentially, "God" wished to "know itself" and to do so split its perception into multiple different perspectives, eventually coming to humanity.<br><br>There's quite a few aspects dealing with Platonic ideals and how reality is derived from them, the most prominent being Adam Kadmon, the archetype of humanity, as well as the Sephiroth, which is more complicated. But basically what you need to understand is that everyone is an derived from/emanation of God in Kabbalah and therefore exists to better understand God through themselves and others. Qliphoth, which means "husk," is a corrupting force which represents the external/material forces of the world preventing you from attaining internal understanding, thus cockblocking your role in the goals of God, who you are (along with everyone else).<br><br>That's the cliff-notes version. So you can kinda see where Miura got the inspiration, but it's pretty different from how it's generally treated in the actual cosmology.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  can Griffith control the dragons and other monster that appeared?  <br>He survived the ceremony which is abnormal.</br>  <br>You know, this is pretty interesting.<br>I should probably read more about this.</br></br>  <br>Never understood this shit. So you become a hermit and then what ? You're supposed to attain some sort of nirvana just by looking at the river flow ? If ants and bees started contemplating life they wouldn't even exist anymore.</br>  <br>Thanks anon. Slan makes more sense now. I actually want to see more of the Astral world because of all the layers and complexities.</br>  <br><br>It's pretty much Judaism's Gnosticism in a lot of ways. It's a bit strange how it came about, too, since it's a noticeable split from what YHVH tends to be about, given that he's a Mesopotamian god the people of Israel just happened to make a covenant with, was very anthropomorphized, and, being a god of war and agriculture, was kind of a dick.</br></br>  <br>Forgiving is not the same as forgetting.<br> you really need to have this pointed out to you </br></br>    It's been so long, I don't even remember what was the deal with this guy besides losing to Guts once.<br>I guess it's time to reread Berserk.</br>  My waifu &lt;3  <br>wasn't he some sort of exiled prince of something?</br>  <br>like these guys need to read up on theri chapter again.</br>  <br>I've just been calling her Strike since day one.</br>  <br>I'm probably a fucking idiot, but I have one question about Berserk that has nothing to do with the new chapter.<br><br>Who was the guy that rode a horse around the city full of corpses? He had a beard and slicked-back hair and I never picked up on why he was relevant to the story.</br></br></br>  <br>He, is the leader of the bakiraka, despite being with just those four guys he has a bunch of fodder assassins as well. He is one of the few people besides the maing gang that doesn't drink the griffith kool-aid and questioned is it right to believe the savior of all mankind just showed up suddenly.</br>  <br>He's in hell now. :)</br>  <br> being a homosexual <br> any year </br></br>  <br>I could see why getting raped, murdered, and diseased to death might prevent you from understanding inner peace and enlightenment.</br>    <br> Nirvana <br><br>Well, now you're talking about Hinduism and Buddhism, although I suppose Kabbalah shares a lot in common with them. All three are "dramatic model" cosmologies which foundationally say "living beings are secretly aspects of the divine masquerading as mortal lives, playing at existence to achieve some end." For Hinduism, everyone is secretly Brahman. For Kabbalah, everyone is secretly Ein Sof. For Buddhism, reality is an illusion created by our selfish desire to cling to what brings us an inherently transient happiness.<br><br>But to answer your question on what you have to do, you don't even necessarily need to become a vanaprastha (hermit living in a hut) or sannyasa (complete asceticism) to achieve Nirvana in either Hinduism or Buddhism. Indeed, part of the Gautama Buddha's myth is him basically going "this asceticism shit is fucking pointless" and trying to figure out what the deal actually was. I think the most expedient way to explain what you're trying to achieve in these and how you go about it would be by contrasting Buddhism and Kabbalah.<br><br>Basically, Buddhism is founded on Siddhartha Gautama's "Four Noble Truths," although a lot of strains of Mahayana Buddhism (what the religion got diluted to when mixed with the folklore of China, Japan, Taiwan, Tibet, etc.) kind of miss the point of them. Original Theravada Buddhism is edgy as fuck and asserts: 1) life is suffering, 2) suffering arises from desire, 3) the solution to suffering lies in curbing desire, 4) desire can be curbed if a person follows the "Eightfold Path." The Eightfold Path is actually a lot less interesting than you'd think and is almost just a Ten Commandments type deal in practice, but it's "right views, aspirations, speech, conduct, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and meditation."<br><br>(cont)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Silat is starting to remind me of Ocelot.</br>  <br>kek<br>where the fuck did you find this?</br></br>  <br>what is up with the bag jokes?</br>  <br>He'll win but most of humanity that is left will hate him for it.</br>  <br> Robert </br>  <br><br><br>By comparison, in Kabbalah, "God" manifest in the material world through ten virtues (the Sephiroth), and following these ten virtues makes a Kabbalist more like God, thus more perceptive of God's nature. I'm lazy, so you can find the listing on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sephi<wbr>rot#Listings<br><br>As to Hinduism, it has a concept called "dharma" which it leans on harder than its peers in Indian spirituality. It's basically a concept regarding the order of the cosmos and the role you play in it and how you were born to follow that role (kinda tied into the Varna caste system, actually). Following dharma leads to good karma, trying to run up against dharma tends to lead to tragedy.<br><br>So yeah, they all have established ideas about how to achieve spiritual enlightenment and such. It's not just going out into nature and contemplating streams... though that could totally be part of it for certain reasons, though.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you for finally shedding light on this - it has always annoyed me how Manga authors throw names like these just to make it sound deep when in reality the true origin of these words relate to a very elaborate mystic system which more often than not has nothing to do with what the authors employ them in, especially when it comes to gnosticism.</br>  <br><br>True.</br></br>  <br> Being a fish in the river of time <br> Not being a beaver <br>Git gud</br></br></br>  <br>Those Indian IT guys always pretend to have western names</br>  <br> For Buddhism, reality is an illusion created by our selfish desire to cling to what brings us an inherently transient happiness. <br>I wouldn't necessarily go as far as to say that reality is an illusion. A better way to put it would be that our experience of reality is the illusion.<br><br> 1) life is suffering, 2) suffering arises from desire, 3) the solution to suffering lies in curbing desire, 4) desire can be curbed if a person follows the "Eightfold Path. <br>The first statement is a bit too strong in my opinion, a better one would be that there is suffering in life. The third isn't completely truthful either, the end goal isn't to curb desire. It's to see the true nature of desire in causing suffering.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>locus is a faggot that is jealous of ricket for not being part of the original hawks</br></br>   That tiny Ubik in the background <br>This fuckin guy</br>  <br> All three are "dramatic model" cosmologies which foundationally say "living beings are secretly aspects of the divine masquerading as mortal lives, playing at existence to achieve some end." <br>I can't say about Hinduism or Kabbalah but this statement is definitely not true in Buddhism.</br></br>  <br><br>To be fair, I realized partway through the post that it's not entirely off in an allegorical sense, hence me starting out "it's totally different" and ending "eh, you can see the inspiration but it's still different." In the same regard, people have pointed out like  and  that the idea is still kind of similar. The horrible things within Berserk's Qliphoth could be construed as manifestations of the concepts real world Qliphoth is supposed to represent.<br><br>And further, Miura really has done a ton of research. To be blunt, I really do consider that idol-fapping motherfucker a genius. Besides the Apostles themselves, Berserk's cosmology is very much based on real world occultism in a lot of ways that's just taken at face value. Although he's tended to avoid referencing actual religious entities, content to invent his own twisted deities in the God Hand and the various pagan spirits Schierke makes use of, a lot of the concepts, particularly the idea of the Astral Plane, are played remarkably straight. On the other hand, he clearly also got a lot of inspiration from D&amp;D, which also plays the Astral Plane remarkably straight (as Gygax intended) until 4e came around and started fucking with the cosmology because they didn't understand why it was fucking significant. But I digress.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>elemental spirits seem to be benevolent<br><br>they're not as strong as god hand tho<br>god hand can alter space and reality</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>man i fucking love this page<br>guts just telling demons to go fuck themselves is the best shit ever</br></br></br>  <br>You mean before Tolkien decided to do that.</br>  <br>I wonder if we'll see more of this sometime.</br>  <br>The Astral Plane in D&amp;D was just a greyish void where githyanki pirates living on rocks made of dead forgotten gods and astral dreadnoughts/juggernauts were waiting as random encounters for high-level adventuring parties to be offed while they astrally projected towards some weird color pool to get to other planes, or as a medium for when you use teleportation magic.</br>  <br>シールケ<br>Shiiruke</br></br>  <br><br>To be honest, I'm toning stuff down a lot for introductory purposes, just delivering the main idea. If I were to be more specific about the Four Noble Truths and how they're perceived in the modern practice of Buddhism (that's not Pure Land durrhurr or Vajrayana fuckery or what have you), it'd probably turn out something more like...<br><br>1. Nothing is permanent.<br>2. The cause of suffering is when we selfishly crave something to be permanent (tanha).<br>3. There's a way to stop tanha.<br>4. That way is the Eightfold Path.<br><br>For contrast, Wikipedia says...<br><br>1. The Truth of Dukkha (dissatisfaction) is that all conditional phenomena and experiences are not ultimately satisfying;<br>2. The Truth of the Origin of Dukkha is that craving for and clinging to what is pleasurable and aversion to what is not pleasurable result in becoming, rebirth, dissatisfaction, and redeath;<br>3. The Truth of the Cessation of Dukkha is that putting an end to this craving and clinging also means that rebirth, dissatisfaction, and redeath can no longer arise;<br>4. The Truth of the Path Of Liberation from Dukkha is that by following the Noble Eightfold Path—namely, behaving decently, cultivating discipline, and practicing mindfulness and meditation—an end can be put to craving, to clinging, to becoming, to rebirth, to dissatisfaction, and to redeath.<br><br>On the one hand, how self-explanatory the Four Noble Truths are is very seductive, but when actually studying them, as is so typical when dealing with metaphysics, they're really quite complex. Of course, if you were to say this to an actual Buddhist monk he would just smile knowingly at you, because you're doing it wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I second this. Buddhism is mainly about the process of attaining freedom from suffering. I like the analogy about the man who was shot by an arrow and went to a doctor, but refused to have it removed before he first learned whether the man who fired the arrow was a soldier or a commoner, and who crafted the arrow and the type and age of the wood. The man dies and never knows.</br>  <br>The old man will be a "allied"?</br>  <br>Zodd is a pussy already for not wanting to fight the Hawk.

Anyone mind explaining where this tidal wave of MMORPG-themed anime came from?<br><br>I recall .hack from way back so the concept isn't new, what made it so popular now?</br></br>  <br>Digimon</br>  <br>MMORPG theme is so old and busted.<br>Resurrection theme is the new freshness.</br></br>  <br>Well, he plans the eradication of a sentient species just to make slightly stronger skellies.</br>  <br>This right here. MMO anime has old source material, soon they've gotta animate something new, and it's all about resurrection nowadays.</br>  <br>Monster Farm</br>  <br>I would most likely say, yes.<br>Because from the previews of Episode 4, it will finish with Volume 1 and dragging Volume 2 over 9 Episodes, would be too long.<br>I would say Episode 5 - 8 will be covering Volume two's 4 Chapters, and Episode 9 - 13 will cover Volume three's 5 Chapters.<br>Everything would be fitting perfectly and ending with a Epic Fight and Ending.</br></br></br></br>  post OC  <br>Nice,here's hoping for a second season.</br>  <br>He's a wizard.</br>  <br><br>Yes we do. Anyone who says otherwise is obvious lower lifeforms (slugs) and should be killed.</br></br>  <br>Because MMOs are dead and we watch the series that use them as a theme trying to relive our best times in games like EQ and WoW</br>  <br>Read the stats.<br><br>Alignment: Extreme Evil<br>Sense of Justice: -500<br><br>Ep 2 the only reason he helped was to see how his powers did against the new world and cause he felt he had a debt to repay to Touch Me. And he wanted info. In other words, he didnt help cause he cares about those humans.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good God, Ainz. That's just overkill.</br>  So I read Book 1 to 4 and the spoiler for the rest to 9, and I am concerned: MC and his army are way overpowered. I have yet to find anyone who managed to be a threat to them.<br><br>Sure, it's fun to follow a badass' journey, especially when he doesn't act exactly like a Gary Stu, but some credible danger would be nice too.<br><br>Hell, form what spoiler I read, book 9 (and probably book 10) will be about raising his reputation to an even higher level.</br></br></br></br>  PVs again in case you missed them.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2kv<wbr>DO3xJFEY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bU5<wbr>xBWmPp34</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Tuesday when? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him, I'm guessing the guy's sane and not overly evil but since he actually has become a lich not only has his emotions being suppressed but he's even matching game stats.<br><br>Though personally if I was extremely evil I wouldn't of left the 2 girls with a protective bubble and drag them along the ground kicking and screaming before dissecting them infront of the village, he could of atomized the village in an instant and saved the chief to force info out of him.<br><br>I know he's smart but that level of evil and to actually help out so much over a PERSONAL debt which he could easily ignore...I got a feeling he isn't sticking strictly to those stats, but I haven't read the manga and not sure if he starts matching stat for stat yet</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's one threat looming in the horizon which will probably come to the forefront after volume 9. It's not a threat that can be beaten physically so Ainz will probably have to do some fast thinking. PDL's not particularly stronger than Nazarick combined but he does have his hand on a  guild  and potential  WC items .</br>  <br>Would be nice to see him unlease the beast   Rubedo [/spoiler[ </br>  <br>Nigga, he's not the type of evil that goes around starting shit (except with the Lizardmen) or flaunting his power unprovoked. I personally believe he's one of the scary type of evil, the smart kind. He's pragmatic as fuck but not above letting any emotion he can feel sway him to the other side. He isn't as evil as he would have been if he'd been, say, born a lich with his stats but he's growing into his alignment pretty nicely.</br>  <br>So without knowing how strong kingdoms are in this world, you would have comitted pointless slaughter with no real benefit. <br>. There's evil, and there's stupidity. Nigga, you dumb</br></br>  <br>After Monday.</br>  <br>I'm playing FFXIV and it's more like the MMO's depicted in these recent anime than anything else.</br>  <br>Is it supposed to be loyal? It looks like it'd bite the hand feeding it.</br>  <br>Indeed, the alignment system in D&amp;D doesn't cover everything for a reason, when Stupid Evil, Stupid Good, Lawful Stupid, Stupid Neutral and Chaotic Stupid most certainly exist.</br>  <br>I thought that's what Int and Wis are for? It's not surprising quite a few people on this board have like -5 on their modifiers.</br>  <br>I suppose stupid being relegated to an INT score makes sense, but even players with proper INT scores still play Stupid all the time. Especially Chaotic Stupid.</br>  <br>I doubt anything in new world could be a threat to Nazarick.<br>Heck an army consist of 1500 demi-god levels 100 and they still coudn't past 8th floor.</br></br>  <br>It was perfectly possible to get through Nazarick with a dedicated team. They just gave up at lvl 8 because of the gotcha and didnt bother to try again.</br>  <br>Weren't most of those NPC mercenaries?<br>Plus all the 41 members were there.</br></br>  <br>Ainz is scared of other players who may or may not show up and we have those Dragon Lords and unknown world items around. Tension is generated because we don't know yet. Overlord has a ways to go and I'm sure there will be dangers that sort of threaten Nazarick...maybe, possibly. But just reading how they crush the lowly humans and enslave the other races is fun in its own way.</br>   Anime too dragged out <br> No spooky orchestra music playing on background when SPOOKY SKELETON on stage <br>Why the fuck is anyone even watching this</br></br>  <br>In the novels, he does experiments on humans. Not sure if they will show that in the anime. But human experimentations are definitely EVIL.</br>  <br>That's just playing out of character, or possibly in line with their background text and such. You can't measure everything with numbers even in DnD after all.</br>  <br>Which NPC ?<br>They can't even touch 1 member since they failed at 8th floors</br></br>  <br>Because It's entertaining and I'm autistic enough to enjoy infodumps?</br>  <br>A lot of those were NPCs and they got trolled by Victim who inflicted all the status effects in the game then Ainz nuked them with a World item.</br>  <br>I remember reading that the 1500 strong army was composed mostly of NPC mercenaries.</br>  <br>From a human perspective. From a Nazarick / Undead Overlord perspective? Not really. He's not even biologically capable of feeling it. <br><br>It'd be like asking a guy who had his nuts and pecker chopped off to stay virile for the rest of his life and he gets to live for the next 300 years after becoming a eunuch.<br><br>It's not like he doesn't realize it's bad by human standards, he just can't afford to care at this point when he's prioritizing safety and his body helps a fuck ton.<br><br>Whereas in a human body he'd be sweating bullets and guilt tripping himself so hard he'd never let it go through.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What about Rubedo ?<br>I thought she's the reason for their failure.</br></br>  Gamma the best.  <br> and the spoiler for the rest to 9, <br>Where?</br></br>  <br> experiments <br> On humans <br><br>I eagerly await this, I know his emotions have been suppressed and this just suits that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You just like lizard sex</br>  “Climb. Even if you desire power, don’t give up your humanity.”<br><br>“Give up on my humanity…? Are you speaking of the likes of demons that appear in stories?”<br><br>“That and others like turning into an undead or magic life forms.”<br><br>“A normal human cannot do something like that.”<br><br>“That’s true… but turning into an undead will often twist your heart as well. Desiring perfection, becoming an undead to achieve one’s ideal… the heart will be tempted by the changing flesh and the resulting transformation will be terrifying.”<br>Nooo Ainz stay good!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm also an animefag. <br><br>He monologues pretty heavily about how his current form is desensitizing him to just about anything that would make him flinch as a human being. <br>Pretty hard to miss the potential for his committing atrocities as he becomes increasingly more absorbed into this form/role of his.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What? Why would you think that? Nothing about her was mentioned during the description of the raid.</br>  <br>The formula is that the MC is overpowered but he plans meticulously and fully expects more resistance but he ends up winning much easier than he expects. It's been repeated since vol 1. Even in vol 7 when Demiurge reveals to Ainz that everyone was planning on world domination he just freaks out for a second then just goes with it. There's a part in vol 4. where he's talking with the Guardians and they are like 'well why don't we just do things more obviously instead of skulking around because then we can reveal the enemies faster' and he shits his robe.<br><br>They can't possibly bring out all the details from the LN or WN. There are far too many one sentence things like Ainz's despair aura or the spooky faces coming from the staff of ainz ool gown that never get mentioned again.</br></br></br>  <br>Not him but Rubedo probably had a part in it, though how much is another question altogether.<br><br>Every single guardian even PA was not allowed on the 8th floor. It takes someone of Victim level to stay on that floor, so Rubedo had to be something special like  oh I don't know made from the Caloric Stone making her a world class npc and living up to her name? </br></br></br>  <br>see<br><br>Rubedo isn't mentioned to have done anything yet. I'm not even sure Ainz visited the 8th floor yet at all, since he told everyone to stay out of there. Apparently the strongest are on that floor, even though they aren't lvl100. This doesn't include Victim who came out during vol 4 to float around for a bit.</br></br></br>  <br>I remember reading somewhere she's guards the 8th floor with Victim and Gargantua. Heck a guy said that she even stronger than Touch Me.</br>  Since Lupusregina is the faith-based caster of the Pleiades, I wonder if her name is a reference to the Bitch Queen, an evil god in the Forgotten Realms D&amp;D setting.  <br>Rubedo being the Miko would mean she is level 100. Unless Miko is another NPC by process of elimination it would make her Rubedo, because Lastborn cannot be the same level as Sebas as written earlier.</br>  <br>I wonder what world class items albedo has. I recently read vol 1 of the LN and apparently she has two but they haven't mentioned them. Isn't she World class npc then?</br>    <br>Gargantua guards the 4th floor.<br> Rubedo is rumored to be the cherry blossoms Guardian in the 8th floor, Victim is the 8th floor Guardian.<br> Nobody is stronger than Touch Me.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, she's on the 8the floor. And the narration did say something vague like "the raid was halted on the 8th floor" and not "Victim stopped the raid on the 8th floor." So I guess it's possible she did something if anyone made it to her lair after Victim went off.</br>  <br>No, it's fundamentally a bit different. Ainz for example has a WC item. However Touch Me is a world class champion even if he doesn't hold a WC item.<br><br>Get the difference? While a WC item certainly puts you on the same level, if not higher depending on the item, your fundamental base isn't changed.</br></br></br>  <br> Nobody is stronger than Touch Me. <br>Maybe Ulbert? Possibly.</br></br>    <br>By tidal wave you mean a splash n the kiddie pool? You can't name more than 5 anime franchises in the last 10 years that have MMORPG in any significant value.</br>  <br>Ulbert might have strongest magic caster class.<br>But he's not world class chamion.</br></br>   Pdf/epub link please. On mobile atm, can't do shit. ;_;   <br><br>can anyone add in ni shibullath in onto the background?</br></br>  <br>Lupus just means wolf son, theres a lot of wolf queens in fiction.<br><br>I figured.<br><br>see <br>was what I read in the novels<br>Rubedo has done nothing, we just barely know it exists.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA</wbr></br>  <br>Ulbert was the magic equivalent of the world champion. This is because the world champion is pure physical and it'd be unfair to casters.<br><br>Ulbert however was always depicted as playing 2nd fiddle, and Touch Me being the gary stu with his ballin' wife and children being a level 100 raijuu.</br></br></br>  <br>It might just be a repeat of the ainz vs shalltear fight with Shalltear winning because Touch Me isn't an npc. <br><br>The goblin with the wc stick would kill him though and all of the tomb.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, anon.</br>  <br>What's this shit I hear about Touch Me and Ulbert getting into it in real life and why it's most likely the reason they quit the guild?</br>  <br>10/10</br>  <br>Many of the 'transported to another world' and "mmorpg is real" have been around for a long time and many are popular. SAO is the latest biggest one for anime, the LN is high ranked as well. Mushoku Tensei is another resurrection type that is the top LN now. But you can go as far back as Zero no Tsukihime or whatever. Overlord is pretty old as is, it took a long time to come from WN-&gt;LN-&gt;anime.</br>    If our youngest was here… if we moved as Pleiades then we wouldn’t have a problem…  <br>So according to Solution, the youngest sister of Pleiades might be in 8th floor too ?<br>Damn, there are just so many secrets about the it.</br></br>  <br>We don't know what Rubedo does. All we know is that currently in the new world Rubedo is the strongest being in Nazarick, cause ya know the other 40 players aren't here and Ainz has one damn gimp shit build that would be low-mid tier max without his decked out items.<br><br>I mean it's a game where the average player at level 100 had 1 divine item max. Max. Most none at all. <br><br>If put into WoW terms, it'd be like vanilla level 60 in blues with one purple from a dungeon versus full t3 with legendary.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe Rubedo's the youngest.</br>  <br>Why I can't touch all of those Albedos.</br>  <br>Ainz didn't actually use any of his skills to win that, just spamming items. You could say that its just a matter of whoever abuses more World Class items at this point and which effect wins harder.<br>Don't forget all the Divine/Mythic class items that fuck people over too. Gazef without his stamina gloves is pretty shit.</br></br>  <br>Maruyama does keep a lot of potential asspullery handy. Half-done character sheets, mysterious super NPCs in reserve. No ability descriptions for Nazarick's world class items.</br>  <br>She's taking about Lastborn.</br>  <br>Don't forget about Albedo's younger sister.</br>  <br>maybe the miko<br>or rubedo is the miko<br>or Albedo's sister is the miko<br>or albedo's sister is rubedo and she's just hiding in the frozen prison for shits and giggles.</br></br></br></br>  Since Gate is going to get localized, I can only hope Overlord does too later down the line.  <br>This is the kind of story I like. I like my OP MC story with a little substance but not too much that it would overpower my hankering for a good beatdown.</br>  <br>If they're lovecraftian horrors they should be enemies to good and evil alike. Not that "summon them and bail" isn't a suitable strategy for an evil person.<br><br><br>A space marine chapter would probably be on even footing with everything but floor guardians and Ainz himself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yep, so you'd have to wonder what makes her special enough to reside on the 8th floor when she's not even level 100.</br>  <br><br>Oh right, forgot about her. Damn, the 8th floor's pretty balling.<br>Victim<br>Rubedo<br>Lastborn<br>What else?<br><br>Which floor sucks, geographywise? My vote goes to Chair's graveyard. Compared to the others, it's a bit not impressive.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't even list out the classes. Since max level is 15 for any class it would have to take up a huge amount of space but of course that allowed him to give Ainz the Eclipse class. <br>I think its a good choice though, because most of the tension in the story is based around how things are going to play out or what new secret move is going to get shown next and we already get enough infodumps as it is.</br></br>  <br>There no information about her so we can't be sure she's a low level NPC like here sisters.</br>  <br><br>The Tundra must be fucking awful if you don't have frost resistance.</br></br>  <br>We can because in the early volumes like vol 1 or 2 it's said other than Sebas the rest of the maids were below a certain level. The second point is the poster of the level 100 npcs, of which there are 9 including the miko.</br>  <br>Not to mention you have to jump into a lake to get to it</br>  <br>I was bored.</br>  <br>Ok, then she must have some special shit like Victim to stay in the 8th floor.<br>Damn, the more we talk the less chance I see PDL could be a threat to Nazarick.</br></br>  <br>This works quite well</br>  <br> fighting cocytus <br>oh god all of them swords<br>I bet his cleave must have been a bitch<br> fighting demiurge in the molten realm <br>I can only imagine him mind controlling people into lava pits.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're forgetting that PDL's main skill is subterfuge and trickery and that Ainz is shit at that. Demiurge will probably have to step up his game in order to prevent PDL empowering Penguin to enslave pandora's actors and stealing all the world items and class changing Ainz to a toad or some shit.</br>  <br> Ourobouros is in the new world and is probably the most game breaking in terms of long term <br> World Savior can one shot all of Nazarick <br> Nameless Spellbook allows PDL to know all of Nazarick's spells <br> Potential players that hate AOG <br><br>PDL himself was never a big deal, it's how he goes Hitogami on Ainz's ass that's the set up. <br><br>Plus, the author stated Certain Death was the Overlord of the new world, not PDL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 70% of her faces show nothing but anger. <br><br>Come on Narb, those humans aren't that bad, calm down.</br></br></br>   “And those glasses… didn’t they seem incredibly expensive?” <br><br> “Could it be a magic item?” <br><br> “No, isn’t it just a luxury item? Maybe a dwarf made it.” <br><br>Fucking dwarves, man</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's something briefly touched on in vol 7. It didn't go into specifics though.</br>  <br>CD is a chump though. As cute as she is.</br>  <br>Except for the Nameless Spellbook, does PDL even has the others 2 ?</br>  He looks pretty fucking good.  <br> All these pests around me, I want to squash them all. </br>  <br>Who is Certain Death ?</br>  <br>I still don't know what fucking race he is</br>  <br>Orobourus has already been used, its not coming back.<br><br>World Savior should still be in the hands of the goblins because no one is out powering them.</br></br></br>  <br>Lolielf that we see hanging around with the Black Scripture guy, so she's Sloan Theocracies bitch. Apparently part of the Black Scripture but not the leader.</br>  <br> it turns out that one of the goblins under Erin has it and she decides to not use it against Ainz because he saved the village <br>That would be a nice tweest.<br> she doesn't know that Ainz could have revived her parents </br></br></br>  <br>Garuda maybe?</br>  <br>There's noting stating a WC item that was used up in the new world returns to Yggdrasil instead of coming back to the new world.<br><br>In fact, assuming Martial Arts was introduced through Orobourus then that's twice it's been used since translation konjac is clearly one use.<br><br>World Savior was already used by the goblin king so it shouldn't be with the goblins since it's a twenty, so even if it's in the new world it's somewhere random. It'd be super dumb luck for goblins to find it twice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The winged god of Ra</br>  <br>confirmed high crit rate</br>  <br>She's beautiful.</br>  <br>What is Ouroboros's power ?<br>Is it alter-reality or some shit like that &gt;</br></br>  <br>Yep. It's the broken shit where you call the admin team and ask them to do something. By far the most potential over the long term if we're talking about items we know about.<br><br>And we know from how Wish Upon a Star changed that Ouroboros would be even more godly in the new world.</br></br></br>  <br><br>There was a post about who was stronger between rubedo and touch me like 2 threads ago. Author said rubedo was stronger than touch me like how shalltear is stronger to ainz.</br></br>  <br> Author said rubedo was stronger than touch me <br><br>Missed it, source on the author word of god link.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't ouroboros one use though? I think the LN mentioned it being used in order to help that guild steal Ainz's secret jew gold mine. I remember that Ainz has at least two one-shot World items, but I don't know what you're implying with Wish Upon A Star.</br>  <br>How did Wish Upon a Star get changed in the nw?</br>  <br> Author said rubedo was stronger than touch me like how shalltear is stronger to ainz. <br>As in, it's a direct comparison? Rubedo is stronger because her skills have good compatibility with Touch Me as an opponent?</br></br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128551<wbr>803/#q128565734</wbr></br>  <br>There nothing stating that orobouros was used for those two things. Another option is that orobouros isn't even in the new world. <br><br>I'm just believing in the fact that the twenty really are just one use items, that does not respawn. So the guild that used it on the mines was the only time.</br></br></br>  <br>One use means it disappears and comes back in the world of Yggdrasil as far as the game goes.<br><br>However, since the item transferred to the new world, chances are after it's used it comes back to the new world. Not proven fact but the way the novels keep hinting at shit and Ainz's paranoia at WC items it'd be more of a buzz kill if it doesn't work this way.</br></br></br>  <br>Not him but author just said she's stronger than Touch Me.<br>There's no comparison mention.</br></br>  <br>nah the twenty and one-use world items aren't the same thing<br><br> Answer: The amount of EXP needed from Wish upon a star is dependent on the type of wish granted. In Yggdrasil a player who cast Wish upon a star would be granted 3 random choices from a pool of choices; However, In the New world the spell is a lot more Omnipotent. But basically the larger and stronger the wish, the more EXP given to complete it <br>https://forums.animesuki.com/showth<wbr>read.php?p=5599818<br><br><br>I don't know where you got that idea about the one use items but I'll assume you're right</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Martial Arts is 50/50 but Translation Konjac is clearly hinted.<br><br>Every fucking species in the world right down to the very last descendent's ancestor somehow managed to eat a konjac? You telling me someone went Santa Claus and spread some language jelly during Christmas for a few years in a row and even went in the sea cause sea races can't be bothered to surface?<br><br>Yeah no.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In the game it gets one of three random wishes to choose from every use.<br>In the new world if you can think it, it will grant it (unless it's going up against a WC item)</br></br>  <br>so what you're saying is<br> Herohero was summoned to spread jelly to the mouth of every being on the planet. <br>?</br></br></br>  <br>Ok<br>So Ouroboros can works on even a larger scale than that ? That's some OP shit.</br></br>  <br>Possibly, but I'm pretty sure he's still busy trying to free Veldora out from the prison. Maybe it was Simmering Teapot instead. She's an eroge voice actor surely making her the best candidate to go Ho Ho Ho.</br>  <br> twenty and one use items not.the same thing <br> These items called the ‘Twenty’ were so powerful that they could only be used once before disappearing. <br><br>No.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What was Teapot's race?</br>  <br>Slime.</br>  There are our twenties that can change the world. We're both arguing about something that may or may not have happened.  <br><br>No wonder he was away from Yggdrasil for so long then showed up overworked.

He didn't quit the game he just logged onto the PTR fucking around.</br></br>  My lord please tell me all the Climb screentime gets toned down in the next chapter.<br>I can't fucking handle the guy. At least Zaryusu was a god damn reptile.</br>  <br>But won't you enjoy how he and Brain get mind fucked by how strong his dandy gentleman effortlessly makes them shit their pants harder than Gazef ever could?<br><br>Especially Brain, he's gotta be going crazy.<br><br> Get whooped by Gazef <br> Think effort is the big difference <br> Gets whooped by Shalltear <br> Thinks race is the big difference <br> Gets whooped by Sebas <br> Just goes with the flow and thinks it's all about MUH MAMORU </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh of course I will but holy shit these last few chapters.<br><br>Also, I liked Brain far more than Climb.</br></br></br>    He thought it was Ainz Ooal Gown for an instance, but it lacked depth and the presence. <br>“Is that… a hug pillow of him… who made it?”<br>“I made it myself<br>Really?</br></br></br>  <br>Climb is basically the kid you are meant to hate or pity or root for, and then a few volumes down the line he  gets Gazef'd, probably by the lizards or Hamsuke. </br>  <br>yes really</br>  <br>Damn, wish I had a waifu like that.</br>  <br>No one can outGazef Gazef.

That's only natural.</br>  <br>Retard-moe has existed before paper existed. It just has so many names across all the languages you can't really tell anymore.</br>  <br>  Imagine he has 80% power of based Touch Me or Ulbert <br>Well damn.</br></br>  <br> I mean, capable to shapeshift into Supreme Beings with only 80% of their original power makes him very versatile and unpredictable. <br>He wouldn't be able to switch equipment during battle, however. So 80% of their strength from skills/races, but not as strong as they would be when fully decked out.</br></br>  <br>Of course it's a thing.<br><br>Did you forget nearly an entire year of "CHAIKA ON THE FRONT PAGE?" posting.</br></br></br>  <br>It's okay. God damn though. All these fucking words about nothing. Yandere fairy is cool though.</br>  <br><br><br>/a/ in charge of having  good taste. </br></br></br>  <br> he shows up <br> albedo kills him <br> Ainz goes "what the fuck' <br> They both realize its pandora actor <br> Ainz rezzes him and give albedo a look with a face that doesn't exist but she can sense his disappointment anyways. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nah. that's them having low wisdom scores that would normally tell them this is totally a bad idea.<br>It's like that tale with the various sages/scientists all trying to one up another in showing off the majesty of a dead tiger they found.<br>The first one writes a Haiku<br>The next does a drawing<br>The next does an incredibly lifelike painting<br>The next makes a model<br>The next one uses taxdermy to show off it's majesty<br>Then they all get together and decided to bring it to life as a true way to show off their skills<br>The random commoner hears this and decides to GTFO as they discuss how to do so.<br>The tiger comes to life and eats everyone but the commoner.<br>High int Low wis.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He wouldn't be able to switch equipment during battle, however. <br> Cash items </br></br>  <br>No, I've seen people play dnd with both high int and wis and still make retard decisions. Cause you can't stop the player behind the character from being dumb.</br>  <br>Racial skill is enough.<br><br>Do you think in future releases, Ainz will allow PA to copy his Eclipse job and going "the goal of all life is death" together?</br></br></br>  <br>Did you really think that no one else knew about that or what?</br>  <br>That's because the player behind the character isn't actually being affected by their character's "high wisdom".</br>  <br>Oh i know. I guess i just felt like pointing out that there can be multiple sources of this.<br> I have a fellow player that I thought was absolutely brilliantly playing a low int character(couldn't be low wis since he liked to mention his high wis) due to the absolutely horrible decision making skills he displayed for months. (Not even on a low scale. Many of the BBEGs are a direct result of his bright ideas.) Then I put my foot in my mouth by mentioning his character had low int and discovered he actually had a positive int modifier.</br></br>  <br>why the fuck everyone keep calling her retard? she just simply hate human and refuse to acknowledge them. That isnt retard, its simply racist</br>  <br>Albedo should ask PA to transform to Ainz and do some kinky shit with him. It's like NTR but isnt actually NTR</br>  <br>The funny thing is he did notice her smell. He just didn't know it was from her.</br>  <br>Be unable to follow simple order is usually a sign that you're not very bright, anon.</br>  <br>nah, I can't help but think of Ainz talking like a nazi in the middle of the act. Talk about a boner killer.</br>  <br>Because he never smell a pussy before</br>  <br>Racism and being a retard usually go hand in hand.</br>  <br>She's also terminally incompetent and takes a while to accept new orders.<br><br>but that's why we love her.</br></br></br>  <br>specist*<br>She doesn't seem to think that copying the image of a human is a big deal either. <br>As for retard she can't follow momon instructions to play the part of a human or even call him by a certain name so thats where it comes from. She also tries to melee down undead dragons while being a caster.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a summon, so it's loyal.</br>  <br> summoned outsiders are loyal <br>No wonder this shit game failed.</br></br>  <br>It's retard in positive way. Retard moe.</br>  <br>Even actual retards don't think racially, many lack the mental capacity to even think in such a way.<br><br>Arrogance stupidity and indoctrination are not to be confused with being a retard, otherwise special schools would be filled with rednecks</br></br></br>  <br>Ainz's was born as an Undead. It's just like the liches he creates, they're like normal people.</br>  <br>Except human beings in reality are born and raised. NPCs are ya know literally made the way they are. No different than someone being born blind.</br>  Please fucking tell me Shalltear will be in this episode?  <br>I shalltear your hopes apart.</br>  <br>nope, well, maybe. Episode 5 is more likely.</br>  <br>From the preview, it seems she will appear in the end of episode.</br>  <br>This season will have tons of her near the end, don't worry. Though if theres a second season the best scene with her will happen then.</br>    <br>Someone translated the WN version of Ainz unleashing the Super-tier spell on the Kingdom's army.<br><br>https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx<wbr>6CgOVk4476Uy1PdU10LXh4Rkk/view?pli=<wbr>1</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Just at the end when Ainz gives that baller speech.</br>  <br>nope. Not going to read it till we're there.</br>  <br>Can't wait for the change of flags part.</br>  <br>He has access to all of their gear.</br>  <br>It has nothing to do with traps/reverse-traps, people generally like Mare and Aura even if it's not a whole lot. It's a feud about wiki/anti-wiki usage, the reliability of information posted here sometimes, and people blindly trusting information without sources.</br>  <br> Double unblockable Wail of Banshees. <br>Sounds like they could beat all the guardians together with that kind of firepower.</br></br>  <br>That was great, I can't wait until we get there.</br>  <br>Brilliant</br>  <br> That there was a player within the Kingdom’s forces <br>nope nope nope I'm gonna wait</br></br>  Is there a picture of albedo in her armor from the LN? Tried googling it and get papa bones or porn.  <br>No, all we know is that it's spiky and you can't tell her gender while she wears it.</br>   His eyes moved from the book and rested on a young woman who was sitting behind the counter, next to the young man. He spoke to her in a gentle voice. <br><br> “Is there a problem?” <br><br> “N-nothing at all…” <br><br> The girl blushed and lowered her face. <br><br> “I just thought… that your posture was quite striking.” <br><br> “Thank you very much.” <br><br> Sebas showed a gentle smile, causing the girl to blush even deeper. <br><br> The gray-haired gentleman Sebas was someone who you would be attracted to simply by looking at him. On top of his graceful countenance, he radiated an elegance that turned the heads of nine out of ten women, regardless of age. It could not be helped that the young woman at the counter would mindlessly stare at Sebas; it was quite common, after all. <br><br>Sebas muh boi.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can see how Touch Me pulled in his wife.</br>  <br>That was excellent.  I guess this means that Ainz still hasn't formally chosen an ally nation, or that he might be near choosing the Empire? </br>  <br>He probably just sits there and points at his baby old ones if anyone trys to cause shit.</br>   killing vampire loli   <br>  He chose the Empire since Kindom send an idiot envoy and piss him off, would be different if they send Gazef the man  </br>  <br>In about a year?</br>  <br>if that's what it takes</br>  <br>This is the WN, the LN is completely different story-wise.  In the WN, Ainz becomes a noble of the Empire. In the LN, Ainz becomes Sorceror King of his own independent country. </br>  <br> killing vampires <br><br>You can't kill what is already dead!</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;In the LN, Ainz becomes Sorceror King of his own independent country. </br>  <br> You'd have to fuck up extremely badly to make Ainz angry enough that he personally comes to slaughter your army. </br>  <br>fucking 10/10</br>  <br><br> It's goes more like this:<br> Empire and Kingdom send their representatives to meet Ainz. <br> Kingdom sends a dick who doesn't understand the power of Nazarick <br> Empire sends the Emperor who praises Ainz and wants to ally him <br> When they are all gone, Demiurge tells everyone that the Emperor probably plans to betray Ainz.  <br> Ainz then decides to ally himself with the Empire,but also show his might to them in case they want to betray him later on.  <br><br><br>In the WN Ainz buys the head-magician of the Empire, gets to a magic school, becomes a noble and the head-magician convinces the Emperor to get on Ainz's good side, just to eventually put Ainz on the lead of the Empire. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br>  <br><br>I prefer the LN way of doing this.<br>Nazarick is strong enough to be independent.<br>Administration will be bitch, but I'm sure they can manage.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or everyone could just leave the undead lich alone and everything he does will to categorize as a natural disaster</br>  <br>In the WN, Albedo also didn't exist. Demiurge and Shaltear divide up her scenes. <br><br>Poor Shaltear, she had Ainz all to herself. It's hard to imagine Overlord now without Albedo though.</br></br></br>  <br>And now Albedo is hogging all the fanartists' attention. Well Akenest is still loyal to waifural.</br>  <br> In the WN, Albedo also didn't exist. </br>  <br>That's so strange to think about.<br><br>Having had no contact with the WN, it just seems like you couldn't replace her if you tried.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Neither does Mare or Victim.</br></br>   Ainz getting embarrassed because he accidentally shows two lizards having sex to Aura and Mare <br><br>My evil overlord can't possibly be this cute</br></br>  <br>Victim sort of half-exists. The author threw around the concept, but never went into details about the 8th floor except that the alliance raid wiped there.</br>  <br> Ainz starts thinking about sex ed to the dark elves </br>  <br> implying Mare isn't a total slut <br><br>Remember that he will try to outbid Albedo for the right to sleep with Ainz.<br><br>Aura is pure and best daughter though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm hoping Mare is just....innocent.</br>  <br>He is. The most innocent</br>  <br> Animefag here. I heard the MC is a villain, but 3 episodes in and he's just generic hero, just a skeleton instead of flashy angel-like shit. <br><br>his decent into becoming a full blown super evil lich-king is surprisingly swift and subtle. parts of it start from the very beginning at the end of book 1 (we might see it next episode)  when he captured some priests/warriors from the theocracy and had them tortured to death for information <br><br>book 2 continues this decent into amoral evil when he casually starts to order  witnesses killed, and leaves comrades to die <br><br>book 3 expands on it further when he  slaughters a whole guild of adventurers rather then let them witness his fight with Shelltear. <br><br>book 4 gets even more grizzly as  he slaughters/enslaves a whole race of lizardmen just for an experiment and to teach some of the floor guardians how to think outside of the box. Meanwhile Demiurge has built a human "farm" where people are held captive; skinned alive to make magic scrolls, then healed with magic to repeat the process for more magic scrolls. <br/> <br>book 5/6 well he's  setting himself up to be a world power, so you probably can guess where this takes us.  <br><br>at this pace the anime will probably end in book 3, so he'll be fairly evil by the point. the problem is he stops thinking of himself as human. Being a lich robs him of "feelings" and "compassion" and he's so much more powerful then the "humans" he starts to see them as "lesser" lifeforms. <br><br>in the end he still has moments where he has acts of mercy/compassion, but they're always calculated to gain something for the Tomb, or as some sort of obligatory repayment to TouchME</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Will there ever be a manly bath scene with Ainz, Demiurge, Cocytus, and Mare?<br><br>While Albedo and Shalltear fight over who gets to peep, so by the time they arrive the only one there is Victim.</br></br></br>  <br>So Cairne village officially joins him when he becomes a world power, right?<br><br>I really want Enri to live on as a loyal servant of her savior Ainz. Especially now that we know the werewolf maido is friends with her.</br></br></br>  <br> There's one threat looming in the horizon which will probably come to the forefront after volume 9. It's not a threat that can be beaten physically so Ainz will probably have to do some fast thinking. PDL's not particularly stronger than Nazarick combined but he does have his hand on a guild and potential WC items. <br>psh. you do know he has access to 20 WC items, and the guild item is WC as well. <br><br>while WC items are deadly and potentially ruinous to papa bones, that's only if they catch him unaware. if he sees it coming they have zero chance.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, after they are attacked by goblins and trolls.</br>  <br> psh. you do know he has access to 20 WC items, and the guild item is WC as well. <br><br><br>He has 12, and the Guild Weapon never comes out. It is said to rival with a WC item, but it would be one of the weak-ones, not the strong 20.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank our lord and savior Papa Bones!</br>  <br> the werewolf maido is friends with her. <br>I'm not so sure about that.</br></br>  <br> Warlord  Enri  the Bloody  is considered a subject of Ainz and Nazarick. <br><br> Since the Kingdom decided to attack Carne (which I highly doubt would qualify as a village anymore), Ainz enters the Kingdom-Empire War on the Empire's side. <br><br> Enri summons a 5,000 strong Goblin army that is supposedly professionally superior to either the Kingdom and the Empire's military. <br><br> &gt;Her army of 5000 goblins includes goblin Hoplites as core troops, goblin beast riders,17 goblin paladin on white wolf, goblin longbows, goblin magic support squad, goblin magic artillery squad, goblin medic squad, goblin musician squad, goblin assasination squad, 13 lvl43 goblin red cap honour guards and a goblin tactician dress as Zhuge Liang. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So Cairne village officially joins him when he becomes a world power, right? <br>its inside the sphere of influence, yes. and unless I've completely forgotten, I'm pretty sure they trade with the tomb. However i don't think Papa bones ever considered them important enough to make them part of his growing kingdom. its such a minor place with nothing of importance i doubt it even occurred to him.</br></br>  <br>   gobbo Zhuge Liang <br> I know what I'm using my next session. </br></br>  <br>  "Warlord Enri &amp; Her Green Horde Going Genghis Khan On Empire/Kingdom's Ass"  -spinoff when?</br>  <br> 13 lv 43 goblin red cap honor guards <br><br>these goblins are stronger than what, 99% of the humans in the new world?</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Enri summons a 5,000 strong Goblin army <br><br>How?  Ainz gave her only 2 horsn and each can summon only ~20 goblins (or so). </br></br></br>  <br> psh. you do know he has access to 20 WC items, and the guild item is WC as well. <br>No, you're thinking of The Twenty, a collective designation for the 20 consumable world-class items. AOG only had 11 WC items: two on the 8th floor, one on Papa Bones' person, one on Albedo, one in the Throne, four in the Treasury, and two unaccounted for. It's unclear if the Caloric Stone (which was used) and Atlas (which was stolen) are counted.</br></br>  <br>I think she also essentially gets the local goblin tribes and ogres to pledge loyalty to her by Volume 8. <br><br>So her goblins have "civilian" support as well as a source of recruits.</br></br></br>  <br>The item  depends on class levels, which Enri gained by leading the original 12 .</br>  <br>They probably don't despawn anymore.</br>  <br> She uses it after obtaining the Commander/General class. </br>  <br> single girl commanding army that can wipe out anything in 1000 km radius (except Nazarick of course). </br>  Can someone spoil me Tsuare's reaction to Nazarik?  <br> It's a special effect of using the Horn alongside her levels in Commander/General. I believe the effect is that it summons a goblin army in proportion to the number of opponents, which in this case, was a army of 5,000 Kingdom troops. Back in the game, the effect wasn't that overpowered, considering that players rarely gathered in such numbers and goblins were weak relative to other NPC summons. Here' as with other items from Nazarick, it's overpowering. </br>  <br>Well might as well go  raiding/nomad  style since feeding those troops is going be quite hard.</br>   hey lets give this completely innocent girl some useless summon items <br> she turns into second strongest power in the region within a year <br>Oh, wow.</br></br>  Now, what I wonder about the goblins is what will happen to them in the long run.<br><br>Supposedly they despawn the next time she blows the horn and what comes out is another goblin troupe appropriate for the threat at the time.<br><br>But what if she never blows the horn again for the rest of her life? What if they set up villages and breed and for hundreds of years goblins slowly expand and form a kingdom of their own with a separate culture and a different way of life.<br><br>What'll happen then to the descendants of the original 5,000 if after all that time someone blows the horn again when faced by two thugs in some street alley? Will the entire thing just poof away and call forth two level 10 goblins? <br><br>I'm probably overthinking this, but the idea of having your entire existence hinge on someone literally blowing hot air is a bit terrifying.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The horn is single-use (Enri has/uses two of them), they disappear after use; the goblins are permanent.</br>  <br>The horns are consumables, she has nothing else to blow but goblin comfort men.</br>  <br>they both will, the question is which one will be the rightful heir</br>  I can't wait for a situation like what the 13 Heroes had to deal with to come around again. Isn't the Theocracy preparing for some doomsday event in the future? How likely is it that Ainz is going to have to step in? That event would probably only affect humans, wouldn't it? Momon might have to do something but would Magic King Ainz be tempted to help out?  <br>I suppose they aren't as ugly as most fantasy goblins. They're built like green dwarfs too</br>  <br>Cool looking party, would adventure with</br>  <br>I wanna hang out with them.</br>  So I'm understanding that shit is going to get dark in this series real fast then<br><br>Animeonly fag, how fucked up are things going to get?</br></br>  <br>yes</br>  More spoilers from Volume 9.<br><br> &gt;1. The Theocracy is the strongest of the human kingdoms<br> 2. humans are in a very precarious position. <br> 3. the dragon queen is a loli <br> 4. the dragon kingdom lost several cities to a neighboring beastman kingdom <br> 5. the humans in the cities were kill and eaten. <br> 6. places that are further away form humans land have been known to serve 6mo old unborn babies. <br> 7. the dragon kingdom pays tribute to the Theocracy every year and the theocracy is expect to help the dragon kingdom in its fight but this time no help has been sent. <br> 8. Gazef points that every time the kingdom and the empire fight over the disputed lands. The theocracy wold sent a diplomatic msg claiming that piece of land.

Maybe this is a case where less is best.</br></br></br>  <br>How about you have none of it!</br>  <br> less <br>*least</br></br>  <br>I don't remember saying you were allowed to come out of your room yet little girl.</br>  <br>Goddamn, Carol and her dolls really look like another Touhou game</br>  <br><br>What if every character gets actually three songs, and the third songs are released together on the mysterious 8th disc?</br></br>  Maria is cool and not useless!  <br>I can totally imagine it. If you put Medicine or Alice as a level 1 boss, you can put the four dolls as bosses up to level 5, and then Carol would be the level 6 boss.</br>  Wait didn't Maria just use it to save people  <br>Dat perfect loop.</br>  <br>That's because her character arc has pretty much completed. Like it or not this season is going to be a lot of DMJii.</br>    Mariabutt  <br><br>Chris was already shown to feel regret at not being able to protect her kouhais, she'll surely be involved with them, and her own story will continue as well.<br>People failed to protect her when she was a child, so her theme will probably be that, protect the weaker ones, including Elfnein.</br></br></br>    <br>If Maria didn't bother with that dumb flourish she could have nailed her right in the face.</br>  <br>She's mad because Maria used the Gungnir to fight. In Hibiki's fucked up little head protect = good and fight = bad therefore fight =/= protect.<br><br>Thank god she's over that already.</br></br></br>  So who joins the couch this season?  <br>What is wrong with this child?</br>  Why is this season so lewd?  <br>Anime-chan.</br>  <br>How is Mamu not on that couch? Is it because she's not a cute girl or because she's not a nee-san?</br>  <br>Carol<br>Chris or DMjii<br>Hibiki or Miku<br>Genjuro</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Yes </br></br>  <br>Daddy issues.</br>    <br>Carol is either Stage 4 or Extra. Either way, she's not actually behind the incident, she just thinks she is.</br>  <br>Poor Aoi's throat.</br>  Not that I care about leddit but I saw someone posting the picked up rates of their anime board and geah was the lowest, at 5%<br><br>It just strikes me as really odd, the show is right now on the top of Amazon JP and at the same time in the west people have never heard of it</br></br>  <br><br>So did Hibiki never learn how to block or what<br><br><br><br>I'd give her something to sooth her throat, if you know what I mean</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It just strikes me as really odd, the show is right now on the top of Amazon JP and at the same time in the west people have never heard of it <br><br>That's good. You want it to stay that way. The less popular it is in the west, the less shit we have to deal with. <br>You don't want those floodgates opened, man.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It happened in a split second.</br>  <br> Feels NTR'd when someone touches Gungnir <br> Has no reason to live once its gone <br>And people say Carol is bullyable, look at this, you could pick it from her neck and play around by throwing it to a friend before she can catch it</br></br></br>  <br>Symphogear is niche as fuck. There's no english community for it outside here.</br>  <br>And that is why I love /a/</br>  <br>She'll just realize that the power with inside her all along anyway.</br>  <br>Aside from here, most other people I've seen talking about the show hate it because it's not highbrow enough for them.</br>   all these spikes <br> four demon eyes <br>So, how much will Dainsleif fuck them up?</br></br>  <br>Maybe in the past, but now CR has it.</br>  <br>When I tried showing it to a friend and he said "she's singing while fighting sperm lololol" and then dismissed me I realized I'm okay with no one knowing about it.</br>   Hibiki   <br>I hope they get it done with quickly and don't draw it out with a bunch of meaningless battles.</br>  <br><br>There need to be four people on this.<br>Mamu would be the third, whoever dies in this season will be fourth.</br></br></br>  <br> no Mamu <br> no Fine <br> no   Chris's purity </br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I'm retarded, of course the fourth person should be Fine.</br></br></br>  <br>She's just not used to using her spear for stabbing. She still thinks it's a sword on a stick.</br>  <br>That's what you get for having friends.</br>  Dess  <br>To be honest, Gungnir is a shitty spear. Kanade used it as some sort of wind fan and Hibiki just straight up punches things. She's better off with Airgetlamh snake dagger.</br>  <br>But why does she look pregnant?</br>    <br>IPS cells and phonic gain</br>  <br><br>The first of many baby swords.</br></br>  <br>Wouldn't you if you were Maria?</br>  <br>The sword penetrated too deeply.</br>  <br>Not pregnant, just a big lunch.</br>  <br><br>Because she had her way with Tsubasa and her mighty sword.</br></br>  <br>There was a waterfall in my pants during this scene if you catch my drift.</br>  <br>Look at this shit. There's liquid already gone from that bottle. <br>Kirika took "A drink for me and a drink for my homies" way too seriously.</br></br>   If Elfnien manages to get any doujins made will they be only about her sucking dick or pussy since she doesn't have anything down there?    explain Chris' past to brother because Commie <br> he replies with the following dead seriously <br> "Yeah, she dresses like a child sex slave so that makes sense" <br>Is this what it feels like to be triggered? I've always known my brother is a bit of fucking idiot, but really? I couldn't even respond because I didn't know where to start.</br></br></br>  <br> That, or futa. </br>  <br>Your brother is right though.</br>  <br><br>She has an anus.</br></br>  <br>   futa <br>Fucking alchemy.</br></br>  <br>He isn't too far from the truth.<br> It is kinda cute that you care so much about Chris that you get bothered by such a comment, though. </br></br>  <br>Her character is done just like Tsubasa which means the only thing left for them is to suffer.</br>  <br>She'll just grow something. You don't really need to justify anything with erodoujins.</br>  <br>It's not futa if she's not a girl.</br>  <br>But loli homoculus don't poop anon.</br>  <br>But wouldn't it be futa if she's not a boy?</br>  <br> GUNGNIR DATO </br>  For some reason I don't entirely buy the "no Mikugeah this season" thing. It may be that I just want to b elieve, though  ;_;   <br>Why did she explode? <br><br><br>She whiffed her 6P she couldn't block. Plus everyone gets fucked by the double team illusion the first time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Chris doesn't dress like a child sex slave, she just dresses like your standard whore.</br>  <br>I don't think so but you got me there, I can't say for sure.</br>  <br><br>How do they get their energy then if not by digestion of food?</br></br>  <br>It's alchemy, I don't have to explain shit.</br>  <br>She should have just shot the laser at this point.</br>  <br>Tsubasa already has a new personal conflict set up for her with the idol dream vs. sakimori duty thing.</br>  Talking about fashion style:<br>Kirika &gt; Maria &gt; Tsubasa &gt; Hibiki &gt; Shirabe &gt; Chris</br>  <br>I doubt that it would make any difference.</br>  REMOVE SYMPHOSHITS remove symphoshits  <br>They're all pretty meh as fuck when it comes to fashion. <br>You're better off just comparing the visuals of the relics.</br></br>  <br>God I hope they keep Carol as the bad guy and don't befriend her in a bullshit way.</br>  <br>I want to forcefully inject my fluids in Kirika.</br>  <br>I don't want her to give up either.<br>SAKIMORI without the concerts would be shit, just a singer without the SAKIMORI would also be shit.</br></br>  <br>I'm not too big on fashion myself, but I think not wearing fucking blue jeans all the damn time is a huge step up.</br>  <br>Why?</br>  <br> I know better how she should fight than the people who make this show </br>  <br>Chris is plenty fashionable, I won't stand for this kind of slander!</br>  <br>Summer uniforms &gt; *</br>  <br>It's not her fault she has no fashion sense, the only people who taught her how to dress where south american guerrillas and Fine.</br>  <br>Too bad, she will be a student at the school in S4 if Nana wills a 4th season.</br>  <br><br>Well, a ranking is always relative, she's okay, it's just that everyone else has a better fashion sense than her.</br></br>  <br>Fine had a great fashion sense, though.</br>  <br>Futa needs both parts, so no.</br>  <br>And dat Sawashiro voice.</br>  <br><br>Not as Ryouko though, Ryouko was the worst-dressed and most ugliest female in the whole show.</br></br>  <br><br>She uses an ice shield, a laser would have turned the ice into water thus nullifying the shield. This isn't complicated science.</br></br>  <br> Ryouko was the worst-dressed and most ugliest female in the whole show <br><br>Chris pls. I know you're a little angry but people in glasshouses shouldn't throw stones.</br></br></br>  <br> science <br> Symphogear </br></br>  <br>It would have been useless anyway. Dolls are Autoscorers are immune to gears. They said this before the show even started and the show has only confirmed it.</br>  <br><br>I'm pretty sure that wasn't normal ice, anon.</br></br>  <br>Her name is Maria anon, subtle pregnancy happens sometimes.</br>  <br><br>I don't know which I hate more, her ugly oversized glasses, her ugly hairstyle or that ugly shitty dress she's wearing.</br></br>  <br>Man, anon. You'd be amazing if you hustled as hard as you hate.</br>  What does the G stand for anyway?  <br>Then why does she even bother defending?<br><br><br>And a laser beam isn't normal heat.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And that's exactly why a laser beam would have never worked. The shield would have most likely reflected it.</br></br>  I still can't believe my favourite song in the franchise returned this ep.  <br>Garment.</br>  <br>It means it's the prequel to GX.</br>  <br>Reference to Getter Robo.</br>  <br><br>It means G o watch the previous seasons, faggot. </br></br>  Does this look like a little Hitler moustache to anyone else?  So did Aoi actually lose her voice, or was that some anon making shit up?  <br>Already did you faglord.<br><br>Then what about the G in G-beat?<br><br>Please explain further.</br></br></br></br></br>      <br> Then why does she even bother defending? <br>A straight physical blow would probably still harm her body. What she can nullify is the super-human powers the gear grants users.</br></br>  I'm genuinely impressed.<br>This name is actually believable. They even put the patronymic in the correct gender. You guys have no idea how often "slav" names are just gibberish.</br>  <br>aoi chan have problem on her voice now</br>  <br>Those tweets talk about how Aoi could barely talk during her during the Nanatsu no Taizai FES and communicated mostly with body gestures.</br>  <br>Slavs have names?</br>  <br> You guys have no idea how often "slav" names are just gibberish. <br><br>100% of the time.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, I see. Thanks.<br><br>I wish I could have seen that.</br></br></br>  <br> gibberish slav name <br>So, like Maria's?</br></br>  I will make three predictions about the upcoming events after episode 4.<br><br>1. Someone we know is not who we think she/he/it is.<br><br>2. Something will soon be taken from us.<br><br>3. On July the 31st Hibiki will wake up in a bigger house.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is this creature</br>  <br> 77 <br>Willed</br></br>  <br>An American Vampire in Tokyo<br><br> Or whatever city the show was set in, I don't remember. </br></br></br>  <br> Hibiki will be out of commission for 2 episodes  <br> Tsubasa and Chris will turn evil  <br> Lolis will get BTFO  <br> Maria and Hibiki will save the day </br></br></br></br>  <br> I wish I could have seen that. <br>They will release a DVD/BD of the event in December.</br></br>  <br>A fairy.<br>You'd let her in, right?</br></br>  <br>Pretty much, yes.</br>  <br>anon t-that's just beautiful</br>  <br>So she's not Maria's biological mother? Why is everybody is this show a bloody orphan?</br>  <br> Tsubasa and Chris will turn evil <br>I can see this happening for a couple of episodes. It will probably be up for Maria and DMJii to fight Tsubasa and and Chris respectively though based on how characters are being put on screen together so far.</br></br>  <br> DMjii <br> one (or both) of them dying <br>I'm scared by the fact that I can see that happening<br>Micha's been getting hyped up as the most combat capable Doll and the OP pairs her off with DMJii, who are arguably the weakest Geahs. What if they get paired off with her only to get BTFO?  What if one dies and the other picks up her relic and does a Geah Gattai? Igalima and Shul Shagana are both relics of the same goddess after all </br></br></br></br>  <br>no she should be  ded </br>  <br><br>Here are my predictions for ep.4:<br>1. Hibiki out of comission and broken for the entire episode<br>2. Focus on Shirabe and Kirika who get into a battle again, this time we get Shirabe's transformation scene. Both their relics get damaged like everyone else's.<br>3. Some SoL scenes with Chris and Elfnein as Chris feels some protective instinct towards her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You need a tragic backstory to be a Geah user.</br>  <br>Obviously not, why would you assume that?</br>  <br> gay <br>seriously anon?</br></br>   dramatic rain <br>Come on Kaneko.<br>Come on.</br></br>  <br><br>Did you miss the whole part where Maria, Serena, Kirika, and Shirabe were all orphans who were chosen for Linker experiments and shit?</br></br>  <br> Hibiki will save the day </br>  <br>What if DMjii gattai?</br>  <br><br>Along with a good pair of lungs and homosexual tendencies.</br></br>  <br>What? How does she look like their biological mother?<br>Maria, Serena, DMJii and all the other kids in the FIS lab were orphans or kidnapped children who might've been Fine receptors.</br></br>  <br><br><br>None of the established seven main girls will die, this is not a show that does shit like that.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Maria called her "mother" once at the end of G after she died, which might be why some people are confused.</br></br>  <br>Maybe now that Geah is shooting for a 20k which could justify movies and other shit, but I bet if this was the last season we would have one of them kicking the bucket</br>  <br>Well Genjuro looked more like Kanade's relative more than Tsubasa's.</br>  <br>I always thought the FIS girls had fairly weak backstories compared to the original girls.</br>  <br> for ep.4 <br> 1. Hibiki out of comission and broken for the entire episode <br>Well you got this one half correct.</br></br></br>  Three weeks until shit goes down.  Commie you absolute fucking cunts.  <br>at least they're consistent.</br>  <br>We all know it was going to happen.</br>  Next Friday when?    <br>All three of them were calling her Mom all season.</br>  Ghost Kanade giving Hibiki a well worth talk, fucking when?  I don't even like big tits very much.<br>Why do I find Maria the most attractive Geah? Is it dem legs? Is it the hair? Is it the voice? Is it all the aforementioned?</br>  <br>Mom, Mam or Ma'am?</br>  Kirika character song fucking when?  <br>How is she more oxygen than carbon? Homonoculi be crazy</br>  <br>I personally find Maria to be the least attractive geah. I don't like her hair in shape and color, and her face is weird. Her thighs sure are godly, though.</br>  <br>They may be cunts, but they're good kind of cunts.</br>  <br>マム</br>  <br>But Maria is ugly</br>  <br><br>They were saying "mamu", however you translate that. Maria said "okaa-san".</br></br>  <br>I am suprised the sum of those numbers is less than 100.</br>  <br>Go to bed Chris.</br>  <br> not liking the bubble gum colored hair combined with the blue green eyes <br>It's a godly color combo.</br></br>  <br>Here is the human body.<br><br><br>Plus all the inorganic stuff listed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Personally I have a thing for really long, impossible hair like Maria, Chris, Tsubasa, and  Kanade  have, so maybe it's that. Her thighs and hips are also not to be overlooked unless you're looking them over, and Youko has my personal second favorite voice of all the Geahs. It's so... another anon used the term 'sonorous' a while back, I think I'd have to go with that.</br>  <br>My personal ranking in terms of attractiveness:<br><br>Kirika &gt; Chris &gt; Maria &gt; Hibiki &gt; Tsubasa &gt; Shirabe</br></br></br>  <br>Never. That would require Hibiki to be on death's door and I'd rather avoid that.</br>  <br>Ugly.<br><br><br> forgetting kanade <br>She's the most attractive of them all.</br></br></br></br></br>  I can't stop listening to the beef stroganoff song.<br>Please send help.</br>  <br>Guess I have shit taste, because she's my waifu</br>  <br>Ghost Kanade was there for Tsubasa. Hibiki will met  her inner berserker.  And they will fist each other.</br>  <br>They'll have zenbuzerker and sakizerker</br>  <br>It's very deep and resounding.<br>Ressou Gungnir is probably my favourite song in the series, it's just so strong and powerful.<br>It has some sort of a valkyrie-like feel to it.</br></br></br>  <br> And they will fist each other </br>  <br>You got it all wrong after Kirika. It goes like this<br><br>Kirika &gt; Kanade &gt; Chris &gt; Hibiki &gt; Shirabe &gt; Maria = Tsubasa  &gt; shit &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Carol </br></br></br>  <br>I didn't count the inorganic stuff. But if such numbers are made up (I couldn't really judge if they were), mistakes happen where you get more than 100%.<br>Seeing how Japan gets basic chess moves wrong, I am rather surprised this did not happen, but apparently the numbers are legit.</br></br>  <br>Tsubasa &gt; Shirabe &gt; Kirika &gt;&gt;&gt; Hibiki &gt;&gt;&gt; Chris &gt; Maria</br>  <br>Your waifu already has a waifu.</br>  <br>Not bad taste at all, anon.<br><br>For me:<br>Kanade &gt; Maria &gt; Biki &gt; Chris &gt; Kirika &gt; Tsubasa &gt; Shirabe<br><br><br>Yeah. Ressou Gungnir is, while not my favorite song, definitely in my top five and probably in my top three. Youko's voice is amazing and the song is, like you said, just powerful.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kanade &gt; Hibiki &gt; Ave Maria &gt; Tsubasa &gt; Chris &gt; DMJii. <br><br>GG no re.</br></br></br>  <br>We can share then</br>  <br><br> Tsubasa this low <br>Shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br>70% water</br>  <br><br>So guys, what are the odds that the next lot of suffering is Hibiki told she'll never walk again, let alone fight. Her friends will try to support her, but Hibiki's complex will twist it into unwelcome pity for her position where she can no longer do the one thing she lives for: helping people. She'll suffer until her own little miracle happens which itself somehow leads to a new more dangerously keen Hibiki.</br></br>  <br>I was only choosing people who are active Gears, otherwise we'd have to include Serena and Miku as well.</br>  <br>Outside of VA there's not a single good thing about her</br>  <br>Yeah, about that</br>  <br> I really like the triple claw fringe hair pointing to her left or some reason </br>    What if Hibizerker was Kanade all along?  <br> Seeing how Japan gets basic chess moves wrong <br>Still mad over Code Geass illegal move?</br></br>  <br> Cool senpai <br> SAKIMORI <br> Tsurugi <br> Blue <br> Biker <br> Elegant <br> Hard exterior with soft core <br>How is it possible to have such plebeian taste</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sakimori is cool</br>  I thought we all agreed that Hibiki is completely unattractive and also has a terrible voice, and yet still manages to be the sexiest, best singer who surpasses Goddesses of this show.  <br>What if Hibizerker was not from Gungnir but a multiple personality disorder?</br>  <br>Triple Eights confirmed for Split Personality.</br>  <br><br>I wouldn't go so far as to call it multiple personality disorder. I'd just say it's Hibiki's subconscious anger at the injustice of the world. She's had to put up with a lot of shit and we're always told how she never really deals with that. She just puts on a smile and keeps helping people out.<br><br>We got a inkling that Hikiki is capable of lashing out. So expect more of it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well Kanade was pretty much a beast when Genjuro scooped her up. That could explain the berserker part.</br>  <br>Miku could use Gungnir while Hibiki is sidelined. She's already a pro at throwing spears.</br>  <br> tfw you will never adopt a wild loli kanade and domesticate her </br>  Can someone upload shouting Y.Aoi from LIVE concert on /wsg/?   People are classing geahs instead of liking them all equally. DESS   <br>I do like them all, but not equally.</br>  <br>lewd!</br>  <br>I don't think she needs to be permanently out of commission. Even a short period of being unable to help would be enough to bring up her survivor's guilt / martyr complex.</br>  <br>Makes me wonder how much she lost her shit after the Noise that they had to put her into a straitjacket.<br><br>And her parents must have been pretty shitty considering her manners.</br></br></br>  <br>Her body is pretty much perfect.</br>  I can't into webms.  I really want some asspull factor to revive Kanade.  <br><br>That's why I said until her own miracle happens. If she knows she'll get better in a bit (like Tsubasa season 1) she would be able to hold out a bit better.<br><br>If she thinks she's crippled, it's game over. She can't help people any more and will instead be a burden (again) which will fuck with her something fierce. Doesn't matter that she has a load of friends now, Hibiki gets weird about that shit because of her previous persecution.</br></br></br></br>  Did nothing wrong  <br>Making my dick hard and leaving me unsatisfied is very wrong.</br>   The anime is different from the novel because Loki time-travels to the past and mess with the timeline. <br>Deepest lore.</br>  <br> xD <br>gtfo</br></br>  <br>Every thread</br>  <br>By the way do we have any bait pic for DxD?</br>  <br>Some new spoilers from EX? <br>How many children were confirmed? &lt;--- This is important!</br></br>    Reminder. S5 never.  <br>Rias child is named Ikusu, and he is the little brother. Other childs are Zenovia´s and not sure if Asia or akeno´s kid. More to come.<br>They want to take revenge on Loki for attacking Asia-mama.</br></br>  First things first. Correction, the child's name is Ixis. Second, the children who show up are Xenovia and Akeno's sons along with Ixis. More are coming. They appear to be in their late teens/grown up and Ixis is much younger.  <br> They appear to be in their late teens/grown up and Ixis is much younger. <br><br>Didn't expect them to be in that age range. Kind of wonder about the others.</br></br></br>  So is there any confirmation that this son of a bitch is why BorN sucked?  <br>Yes, he got shafted, but brought a considerably more dangerous enemy with him.</br>    <br><br><br>what's this ? didnt follo everything for a while somewhere vol15. They have kids now ?</br></br></br>  <br>With the last blu-ray comes the first novel chapter of a special story about Issei´s kids coming from the future.It seems to tie the LN with the anime.</br>  <br>You're right, dying wasn't wrong</br>  Would you a magical girl cheerleader?  <br>Can I get her sister too?</br>  <br> implying a cheerleader would me. magical or not </br>  Looks like Vol. 20 is on nyaa    <br>The funny thing about this super deep plot is that Raynare actually can come back in the anime. It would be pretty funny if she did and  as a possible protagonist joining up too. </br>  <br>someone once said that it'd be fun if she came back as Yuuma being all sweet and with no memories of what she did<br><br>That'd be awesome for all the awkwardness it'd bring</br></br></br>  <br>not really ashy lover , she is dead and gone.<br>Loki came back because he was left alive in the LNs.<br>ashy tits is literally erased from existence , the only way for her to come back is some one actually going out of their way to get her from a previous point in time, and she really fucked so many people over that no one would actually do it .</br></br></br>  <br> Mention Raynare <br> omg ashy lover! ashy lover! <br>Fear not though, my dear basement dweller, for I really am not a Raynarefag. Im simply pointing out the possibility of her coming back since this entire series is pretty much out of wack for me and its gotten pretty shitty to be honest. I didn't think Ishitbumi would go as far as doing this whole time travel bullshit, but it seems like he really wants to milk in the cash now. I'd expect a lot of things to not make sense if he's really going to continue on this route, especially with the whole 'expect things to be different from the novels' theory.</br></br></br>  Still best girl.  <br> especially with the whole 'expect things to be different from the novels' theory. <br><br>Not that guy, but that was only for BorN. The sole purpose of all of this was EX. That's it. We're done. With a big fuck you to anime-only viewers.</br></br></br>  <br> Bring her back! <br> but have her completely different! yeah! <br> no one will mind if she jjust doesnt remember how much of a cunt she was! they will just be awkward about it <br><br>Fucking those ashes is messing with your head, Rias alone would burn her again as soon as she sees her, Akeno would probably do the same, Koneko would punch her head off, hell even Kiba would just stab her ass.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> there are Asiafags </br>  <br>But the whole point of EX is to stop the differences anon. You're misunderstanding the purpose of it.</br>  <br>Now tell us how you really feel.</br>   [FFF] Highschool DxD NEW - Vol.02 [BD][1080p-FLAC] <br><br>IS THIS REAL LIFE</br></br>  <br><br> I-Im not a raynarefag silly! I dont even like the series!  <br> side story that has no effect on the novels and after its resolved has no effect on the anime other than fixing the Loki related bullshit <br> HE WANTS TO MILK THE SERIES!!!! <br><br>So did you loose your shit this hard over the sex changing gun side story ? or about the 300 clone side story?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that webm  <br>My dick thanks you.<br><br>Also, Rias a best and I want to marry her.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I dont even like the series! <br>I don't believe I've said anything of the sort. I did mention that it felt too out of wack but that's about it. But it seems like you're the one getting too defensive, kid. As far as I'm concerned, yes he really does want to milk the series at this point, and your point being? I don't see how the side stories would be grouped into it considering they actually got their own novels and were in the timeline of the entire universe. This time travel bullshit is definitely crap.</br></br>  <br>FINALLY<br><br>Now all I need is a full BD scan of BorN 01 and this is the best day ever.</br></br></br>  Why she was so tempting?  <br>I have no clue where the rip is for volume 1. Pretty weird.</br>  Just finished watching DxD BorN.<br><br>I AM A FUCKING CASUAL ANIME WATCHER AND NEVER GET MAD AT BAD QUALITY BUT HOLY FUCK THIS ENDING WAS SO FUCKING BAD.<br><br>Also Asia literally the worst girl I've ever seen in an anime.<br><br>This is how I feel right now:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ROW<wbr>1JSLN7aY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Blame Loki for messing with the timeline.</br>  <br> Asia is the worst girl I've ever seen in a Anime <br>Asia is the worst dxd without a doubt. Wost girl ever? Probably not.</br></br>  <br>I haven't seen that much anime, so that's probably why my statement holds.</br>  <br> Rias' face when Akeno got preggers before her </br>  <br><br><br> tfw you will never marry Rias and have children with her. </br></br></br>      <br>Yeah, that's why I said she changed it to today's moe. Ritz gotta keep up with the times.</br>  <br>it's served her well so far.</br>  <br>She didn't change it that much, she just updated it a little (and by that I mean she learned how to draw faces and necks)</br>  <br>Did Yue and Hayari even play in this tournament?</br>  Is the anime doing a good adaptation so far?  this last arc is fucking things up. how long can a fucking banquet last. they are really destroying the pace.  <br>It was only 10 chapters and it's almost ending.</br>  <br>It feels like another karaage arc to me. Something light hearted before shit goes down again. Just can't wait to see what goes down and how. My expectation is that it will involve Erina quite heavily since she has had so much presence recently</br>  <br>That was cute as fuck.</br>  <br> it was only 10 chapters <br>the thing is 10 chapters of the same thing. the autumn election was not only based on ONE fucking fight.<br>yes there are many different movements souma is taking. but it took really long. it could have been simplified to 6 to 7 chapters. with the other 3 or 4-5 chapters still being the same festival but with different things to do.<br><br><br>I didn't think the karaage arc was shit, but like you said it has the same feeling. the arc itself was also long.<br><br>Seeing some Erina happening would be nice and would give some progress FUCKING FINALLY</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If we group the girls by maturity and the most complete girl for Darling, the list should be something like this (?) <br><br>1) Rachnee<br>2) Cerea<br>3) Miia-Mero<br>4) Papi-Suu<br><br>As always the playlist.<br>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?li<wbr>st=PLaWNUYckT3OPH6k_Ow2FB1CwijLzU3b<wbr>7p<br><br>For the casual faggots or the people who doesn't read the last chapter of the manga go to prettyanonymus and download the chapter</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He'd obviously confront the problem head on, if you know what I mean</br>  <br> Centaur pussy hard to get into  <br>Wow, must suck to have a small dick, Darling.</br></br>  <br>Wait a few months</br>  Rachnee is for _______________  <br>Papi might be good. It needs to be resilliant for eggs to pass.</br>  MS scans up:<br><br>http://readms.com/r/akame_ga_kill/6<wbr>1/2878/1</wbr></br></br>  <br>A VN of it would be great I'd think. Takahiro could also include all of the dog clown rape incest he could dream of since no one gives a fuck what kind of content is put into VNs.</br>  <br> Tatsumi could have saved the revolution if he kept Esdeath busy <br>Well shit... I think you're onto something.</br></br>  <br>You're an idiot if you think any of that would have stopped Esdeath.</br>  <br>Him staying on the island for a month with her would have ended the whole revolution considering Esdeath is literally the only thing keeping the Empire from getting taken over at this point.</br>  <br>The Boss went and assaulted Normandy on commando mission at 9 months pregnant so I doubt Esdeath would accept any less.</br>    — Best girl won.   so Gaju-kun go with who?  I love this manga. <br><br><br>With her brother since real best girl lost.</br></br></br>  Chapter 40 when? <br><br>Never mind, found it on jcafe</br></br></blockquote>]
