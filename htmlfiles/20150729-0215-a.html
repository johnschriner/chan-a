There's only a few quick scenes that are funny, but the music itself, and the largest part of the opening sets the mood up quite well.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just for people who are somehow overwhelmed by vocals or something, listen to the instrumental version.<br>Once again, I think it is melancholic and emotional.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ziz<wbr>_NVUaYws</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  OreImo OP is nice  Nana has really great OPs and EDs<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5kC<wbr>bwVFwjM8</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=FlS<wbr>pEEB3sbA</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wUz<wbr>daCHM6WM</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pyB<wbr>QIkVNU04</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Nxb<wbr>5l_4eDF0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah fuck it, posting them all<br><br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3Ga<wbr>2MqOI9Y8</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=cCQ<wbr>KCe-5PTY</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=AVA<wbr>2rXTeRGg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Best SZS OP: Daydream rumba<br>Best SZS ED: Zetsubou Restaurant</br>  <br>the duet?</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gRn<wbr>m-769QLE</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Only my railgun didnt do it for me <br>better than judge light though</br></br>  <br> PIN PON <br> not PYON PYON <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ite<wbr>UFjUCysQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Edgefags everyone</br>  <br>The same thing I thought reading that comment.<br>So insecure he has to call out on someone who are at least not posting a slightly homoerotic OP, but a cute girl one.</br></br>  <br>I watched it maybe a month or so back after seeing some threads and getting to it on my backlog.

Anyone can blindly swallow demands, even a kid. I predict that they'll add "some degree of elasticity" to the treaty's text. If they can't even do that, Japan may as well be America's dog. <br><br> This is in response to the TPP finalizing the copyright protection period as "70 years after the author's death", and non-Antragsdelikt. The latter means that anyone can report a copyright violation, it doesn't have to be a formal complaint by the author. </br></br>  <br>Well, the problems with the TPP is that they're trying to force ISPs to become IP gatekeepers. Effectively meaning a huge censorship power will be forced upon them.</br>  http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-ne<wbr>ws/2015/07/27-1/manga-author-ken-ak<wbr>amatsu-renews-concerns-about-trade-<wbr>deals-effect-on-doujinshi-and-cospl<wbr>ay</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>  I just don't care anymore.

I just don't care anymore.  <br>Too late.<br><br>It already passed.<br><br>We fought hard.<br><br>There was an EPIC shitstorm on /pol/.<br><br>But I guess shitposting and memes are more important.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They win when you stop caring.</br>   Disney once again pays out the ass and changes the law to keep the Mouse   <br> http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-n<wbr>ews/2015/07/27-1/manga-author-ken-a<wbr>kamatsu-renews-concerns-about-trade<wbr>-deals-effect-on-doujinshi-and-cosp<wbr>lay</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr> </br>  The world is going to destructive apocalypse in a handbasket with the TPP and all people can talk about is a fucking blonde guy who won't even win the GOP primaries.<br><br>Fucking media are corporate scum.</br></br>  So, will anything actually happen? We had similar things before and not much happened.  <br>Did he always use two guns?</br>  <br><br><br>Could you stop this?</br></br></br>  <br> There was an EPIC shitstorm on /pol/. <br>Fuck off, we don't care about /pol/.</br></br>  <br>The only thing that passed was the Trade Promotion Authority.<br><br>And by only 10 votes in the US House. Yesterday, 11 Democrats who voted for it said they'll vote against the TPP if certain conditions aren't met. So there's still a chance.</br></br></br>  <br>Companies rule the media too</br>  <br>Any butthurt faggot on the Internet can now report doujins for copyright infringement. So yes, it's huge. People will be more willing to take legal action.</br>  <br>So we all go irc, problem solved.</br>  So what? Why should doujins be the only exception from copyright laws?<br><br>This has been long overdue tbh</br></br>  <br> people will stop doujinshi from being made <br> we'll go to the IRC and so download the doujinshi that weren't made </br></br>  <br>TPP does not make doujinshi illegal though.</br>  First thing to do if this passes is takedown any yuri doujin scanlators/artists. <br>The storm is coming.</br>  <br>This also takes away the free advertisement for the author of the original source the doujins were made from. Even if the mangaka/anime studios don't have a problem with the doujins, if someone reports them they're gone.</br>  So wait did it already pass or is this just the monthly bitch thread about it?  <br>Doujins aren't exception, the copyright holders in Japan seriously don't care about people making them for basically no profit.<br><br>But now TPP would make it so that copyright holders in Japan not giving a damn about doujin makers doesn't matter, anyone can shut them down since it's violating copyright.</br></br></br>  <br>They never have been. But the companies that hold the rights never went after them because it would be absolutely terrible for business and possibly cripple the entire industry.<br>With this shit, they don't have a choice in the matter because other people will go after them for it.<br><br>It's like if the police were forced to press assault charges on your child because he hit you with a wooden bat and there was nothing you could do about it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Japanese industry already has copyright laws. They're putting shitty American laws on their copyright laws.<br><br>Copyright laws were created to protect creators. American copyright extends protections after the creator's death plus 70 years, which is stupid and stifles innovation that Japan has. Which is why we've gotten much more variety in anime/manga in Japan compared to the shit comic book capeshit we have in America.</br></br></br>  <br>What kind of retards came up with this shit?</br>  <br> tbh <br>Kill yourself<br><br> copyright laws <br>Copyright laws for the most part are stupid, and piracy should be supported. This sort of shit is bad</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>see <br>And that's in the States. But if it does go through all the way and Japan signs it (which is more or less decided), things go really south.<br><br><br>Corporate.</br></br></br></br></br>  How much time left?  Americans: Ruining everything since 1776<br><br>Thanks a lot you mobility scooter riding fleshbags full of shit. Go choke on some hamburgers.</br></br>  <br>Bigwigs who can actually profit from all this.</br>  <br> unauthorised depictions of copyrighted characters in copyrighted manga <br> not illegal </br></br>  <br>i dont know</br>  <br>Exactly.<br>TPP didn't change that.<br>Moron.</br></br></br>  <br>and that 70 years was after they extended it. see<br><br>Disney has twice paid enough people to get laws changed so they didn't give up Mickey Mouse and alot of other IPs</br></br></br>  <br>There are original doujinshi. Not all are parodies.</br>  Once again americucks ruin the world  thanks corporatism  I don't even care anymore  <br><br>4chan should block foreign IPs.</br></br>  <br>thanks usa</br>  Time to expand my panda folder,huh.  <br>Getting rid of over half of your site's traffic isn't exactly good business.</br>  <br>Curious why is Disney in danger of giving up the mouse and their IPs? Like aren't they actively using it?</br>  When will americans stop sucking corporate dick?  <br>It's irrelevant. Copyright is for a set period.</br>  <br>When they stop liking money.</br>  <br>When Hell freezes over.</br>  <br>And trademark is infinite as long as the ip is in active use.</br>  <br><br>You can't be this retarded. Surely.</br></br>  <br> I predict that they'll add "some degree of elasticity" to the treaty's text. <br><br>Why are you all panicking?</br></br></br>  <br> most Americans being piss-poor but still believing that one day they'll be rich as fuck. </br>  <br><br><br>So if copyright ends but the trademark is active due to the ip being active, what consequences would befall Disney hypothetically speaking? I'm trying to grasp why they are trying so hard or these laws.</br></br></br>  <br>Elasticity will just make it more vague and therefore easier to abuse</br>  <br>Because Japan has no real power over international policy that's spearheaded by Murrica. They are America's dog, after all.</br>  <br>It would be easier to dodge the copyright stuff.</br>  <br>We disagree.<br><br><br>It's less about Mickey and more about all the other stuff that Disney has brought out back then, like movies etc.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Well, the problems with the TPP is that they're trying to force ISPs to become IP gatekeepers. <br><br>Nope, not gonna happen.<br>Nobody will support it since it goes against many rules of privacy.</br></br></br></br>  <br> most Americans still have the pride to not want to make a living leaching of other peoples money. <br><br>Yours is the most healthy country in the west at least in this respect</br></br></br>  <br>Do you have any idea how much media disney owns?</br>  <br>But don't they actively use those movies and stuff in Disney World/Land/Sea/etc? I mean last I went they had fucking everything and then some, or at least to my limited knowledge.</br>  <br>Considering google, facebook and microshit are selling literally everything you do on your computer do you really think that has any relevance to anything? Not to mention all the NSA shit.<br><br>Privacy has been dead for a long time.</br></br></br>  <br>No, that's why I'm asking.</br>  <br>One thing is spying on me, I know they can't do shit with that data, another thing is blocking my access to some sites.</br>  I thought there was already a thread for this.  <br> Nope, not gonna happen. <br>That's already the rule being negotiated now. The only countries with sizable populations against the TPP are Malaysia and the United States (only 38% support).<br><br>So what are you going to do?</br></br></br></br>  <br>And then you realize that you're actually the only person left.</br>  <br> people still don't know disney owns an absurd amount of the media </br>  <br> kikes <br> not owning everything <br><br>Pick one<br><br>"There's no such thing as public opinion, only Published opinion"</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  I know they can't do shit with that data <br><br>Do you seriously believe this?</br></br></br>  <br> Nobody will support it since it goes against many rules of privacy. <br>that's what deutschland said too, and look what happened</br></br>  <br>Have a look at the chart. Disney owns a decent chunk of all media you come across. Music, images, sport, TV, films, productions, news, etc.<br><br><br>Actually you can do an obscene amount with that data. I briefly worked for a company that collected data on CC transactions for a supermarket chain. The profiles you can build from just that is terrifyingly detailed. There was an uproar a few years ago because Target marketing department knew women were pregnant before they were and would send out advertising for pregnancy/baby stuff<br>http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmir<wbr>hill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-<wbr>out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before<wbr>-her-father-did/</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Feels good to not consume any of this media.<br> don't own a TV <br> don't listen to or read news <br> don't do anything online exept fap, 4chan, animu and mango <br><br>When I look at normalfags I feel like a modern day hermit, and it feels good.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where do ISPs censor stuff in germany?</br>  <br> don't listen to or read news <br>That's not something to feel good about.</br></br>  <br>Don't tell /a/ about the incoming 1984.

Too bad, anything from ESPN is gone too.</br></br></br>  <br>"News" is cancer.</br>  <br> &gt;don't listen to or read news <br>That's not a good thing.</br></br>  <br>Yeah unless you still have to pay for it<br> you have to pay for free tv even though you don't watch it <br> you have to pay for radio channels even though you don't listen to it <br> now they want you to pay for public traffic even though you don't use it <br><br>Living in Germany is fucking retarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So what happens when 4chan goes down due to people posting copyrighted disney material? <br><br>Mass Suicide.</br></br></br>  So I better download all the doujins and fanart that exists of my waifu as soon as possible?  <br>Which data was used to reach that conclusion when the women didn't even know about their pregnancy?</br>  <br>Only if you're unable to reflect and filter.</br>  <br>What are you waiting for?</br>  <br>moot predicted that the entire internet would go dark as anons would invade every single community.</br>  <br>Why? I can't stop any of the bad shit happening and I don't want to worry about it since there's really nothing I can do, when I was younger I used to try. We don't have any control over stuff and this thread illustrates a prime example of that. I'll deal with it when it comes around.<br><br>Why do I need to know what's going on in someone's version of the 'news' which is likely just propaganda anyway? Why do I need to know that there was a horrible rail accident in another country? It doesn't effect me at all, the only people who need to know are normalfags who have to be able to hold conversations with other normalfags about what's going on in the world.</br></br></br>  <br> So what happens when 4chan goes down due to people posting copyrighted disney material? <br>I'll do what I probably should have done a long time ago and reading good fiction and non fiction books in every minute of free time.</br></br>  <br>Because news tell you how much shit is going down. All I read in newspaper the last few days is "ISIS HERE, BOMBS FUCKING EVERYWHERE. HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE FOR THIS CAT TO CLIMB THIS TREE?"</br>  <br> So what happens when 4chan goes down due to people posting copyrighted disney material? <br><br>I'll either become serial killer or get into politics.</br></br></br>  <br> reading books <br><br>Fuck off, nerd.</br></br></br>  <br> Not reading alternative news <br><br>Your loss</br></br></br>  <br>Only if you want to get sued. It would be better that you forget about her before they start suing for thoughts as well.</br>  <br>Anon moves and infects every other community on the net. 4chan is a containment website, a majorly important one at that</br>  <br>How fast do you read? Because buying books constantly gets pretty pricey and it's not like you'll be able to pirate them.</br>  <br>Mangos are books, anon. And animes are moving mangos so books as well.</br>  <br> alternative news <br><br>For what? News are pretty much controlled by the media.<br>The Ebola case was a huge deal but then 10 days after there was not a single article about it as if that disease never happened.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't that the same thing?</br>  <br>Pretty much. And I can't be bothered to spend an hour or two conducting independent research to find out about the what may be the truth behind the subject matter of an article I read that was concocted by some journalist jew with a shitty bias and an agenda. Only to learn that it was all half truths and omission but that I am, in fact, still fucked anyway because the government have made it a auto life sentence for microwaving your HDDs.</br>  <br>You don't need to buy new.<br>My father reads a lot and he goes to the flea market once per week to stock up on new books for 50 cent per piece.</br></br>  Revolution when?  <br> and it's not like you'll be able to pirate them. </br>  <br>The library is still a thing.</br>  <br>Dunno if you'd be able to do that since publishers don't get money from reselling books.</br>  <br>If you're that Kraut you might want to try Die Anstalt.<br>Otherwise, Last Week Tonight.</br></br>  Aside from signing the treaty, doesn't a country have to ratify it for it to become law? I can't imagine any truly democratic parliament (especially an upper house) passing a treaty that so heavily infringes upon a nation's right to independence and self-government. Isn't this the reason why Chairman Obama wants to FastTrak™ it? Japan especially would NEVER ratify a treaty which allows filthy foreigners to ravage it so hard.  <br> I can't imagine any truly democratic parliament <br>Shame there's no such thing</br></br>  <br>Except I don't and will never have a girlfriend or family so 90% of the drain most people experience on their finance doesn't apply to me, I live comfortably on very modest income.<br><br>However I still pirate my shit whenever I can.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Not reading alternative news <br>What, like Vice or The Onion? <br><br>More like alternative bias, amirite?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Die Anstalt <br>That already sounds like propaganda. What news do they cover for example?</br></br>  <br>Government is run by the highest bidder. Copyright holders are lobbying this in all their countries, that's why it's being fast tracked and kept in as much secrecy as they can to let it pass without any interruptions.</br>  <br>Anime is as big as it is because of doujins and fanart. If they want to kill their own business fucking let them.</br>  <br>That's not really true, the fact that the executive in the USA is being forced to use a non-democratic process to pass the treaty is testament to this.<br><br>The fact that such a process exists in the first place is a whole other story.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a satire show.<br>Differently from the old format "Neues aus der Anstalt", their focus is no longer on being funny but on actually trying to explain matters.<br>It's rather left-wing though, so you might dislike their view on topics.</br></br></br>  <br>Im not talking about liberal garbage<br><br>More like  "conspiratorial"  news</br></br></br>  <br> Vice <br> Onion <br> news <br><br>What news?<br>All they blogpost about is how it's wrong to be a white cis male.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The admins here don't seem to be worried, and that's enough proof for me. <br><br>Everything will be okay!</br></br></br>  仕方が無い  <br>D you even realize how sold out the American government (and not only) is? Why do you think people have been wanting for a long while to make it illegal for them to get paid by big corporation? Democracy is a nice sounding myth. Like everything else it doesn't work because of humans. You think CISA and whatever was bad? This the same thing on a world scale including things outside the internet too giving complete control to companies to outsource their work force, make laws that suit them, spy on you in case you do something that might cost them money and completely not care about any consumer friendly laws.

A few years after, nothing fucking happened and a lot of people pirate without concern. Sure, there might have been some high-scale downloaders that got arrested (and I'm pretty sure the Megaupload incident scared off some casual pirates) but so far, I haven't heard of people getting warning letters or shit like this, neither have I gotten one.</br></br>  <br> America has an official form of political corruption <br>I'm so shocked by this. Truly the land of the free.</br></br>  <br>I'd threaten them with a gun to their heads if that counts as lobbying against lobbying</br>  <br>Lobbying is still technically an expression of democracy and free spech, so laws against it wouldn't survive a legal challenge. It'd probably take a referendum to fix it, and even that might not be an option.</br>  <br>I think we're past the point where it matters if the majority thinks we look crazy or not.

We can tell stories of better days.</br>  What's /pol/'s favorite anime?  <br>I'm not Clapistani. Australian politicians are useless. The only pollies who have tried to do anything have more or less been told by the government to keep quiet and wait for more information.</br>  <br> not suing the lawyer for their own copyright infringement </br>  <br>There used to be regular LOGH threads on /pol/,</br>  <br>Russia doesn't have enough money to pay off all the mujahedeen in the Middle East.

They should pay them in lead. Kill all of them including the children. You know the good old russkie way.</br></br>  <br> There was an uproar a few years ago because Target marketing department knew women were pregnant before they were and would send out advertising for pregnancy/baby stuff <br><br>Actually, the uproar was because Target knew the girl (who if I remember right was underage, and if not was definitely still living with her parents) was pregnant before HER FATHER knew, and when they sent her baby ads he took it as Target trying to push girls to become unwed (teenage?) mothers. Again, not realizing his daughter was a slut who was already knocked up.</br></br></br>  <br>fuck /pol/ they are an inverted version of tumblr sjws</br>  <br>Fuck off retard, you are in /pol/ territory now fuck off.</br>  <br>These aren't anti-piracy laws. They are trade agreements. Trade agreements with terrible clauses. <br><br>Trade is the strongest political force in the world, always has been. There is a reason why people like Google and Wikipedia aren't up in arms about it this time. We are dealing with a different monster altogether.</br></br></br>  <br>So why is it that amerifags have such a boner for weapons but when a chance to use them appear they never use them<br>Doesn't your right to bear guns exist only for this sole purpose?</br></br>  <br>That was brought up in the last topic and promptly ignored by the americucks</br>  <br>What do they gain from sending troops somewhere?</br>  <br> WW2 <br> success <br>Cleaning off the leftover dirt is not a success.</br></br></br>  <br>If the original author is alright with it, then it should be ok. Sueing someone for using someone else's characters despite the person being okay with it is a waste of time and energy, and it's only going to waste some money in judicial affairs for a non-existent gain in term of corporate affairs. They'd have to sue the person REALLY hard to cover all the expenses, and all of this for nothing because it won't improve at all the numbers of official merch selling (it might even lower them through boycott).<br><br>I'm pretty sure manga authors and anime studios are aware what makes money, and will prevent such shit from happening, they are not stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>No really fuck off /pol/tard. <br>All you faggots are capable of is crying about people not accepting your delusions about race and other social politics bullshit.</br></br>  <br>I dunno what would a a military based economy gain from a military action which also wins them natural resources and soft power?</br>  <br>Now the popular opinion in America is very anti gun, unless it's in the hands of law enforcement. I need to get out of this country</br>  <br> I'm pretty sure manga authors and anime studios are aware what makes money, and will prevent such shit from happening, they are not stupid. <br><br>Pretty much this. People forget that anime producers have their own lobby shit. It is safe to assume they are doing their job and try to get some loopholes into TPP.</br></br></br>  <br>Hearts and minds :^)</br>  <br> If the original author is alright with it, then it should be ok. <br><br>TTP literally changes that fact. That's the core of the problem for /a/-related material.<br>If there's a copyright infringement anyone can sue, even if the original author is okay with it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> waste some money in judicial affairs <br>That's the point. Lawyers' pockets get fatter and they barely have to do anything.</br></br>  <br> If there's a copyright infringement anyone can sue, <br>why did anyone think thats a good idea?</br></br>  <br>I don't see how that can possibly protect the third party lawyers from the original creators for fucking around with their shit. Don't tell me the copyright holders can't sue the lawyers back?</br>  <br> If the original author is alright with it, then it should be ok <br>But that's the point of TPP.<br>Even if the original author is ok with it, they have no say about people suing doujinshi authors.<br><br>Besides, the main problem with this is that TPP may affect entire doujinshi and image aggregate sites and shut them down.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why wouldn't it be? This way corporations have their copyrights protected without having to shill out money to do so. Win-win.</br>  <br>Because it allows Clapistani lawyers to get filthy stinking fucking rich.</br>  <br> Don't tell me the copyright holders can't sue the lawyers back? <br>nope</br></br>  <br> copyright holders already don't sue doujinshi authors <br> going to sue high-power lawyers </br></br>  <br>Of course they can't. They'd be acting well within the law.</br>  <br> Why do you think people have been wanting for a long while to make it illegal for them to get paid by big corporation? <br><br>I've always wondered what keeps this from happening. It's clearly the only way to make things more fair.</br></br></br>  <br>But is anybody really going to do this? People and judges will know that this sueing won't benefit the author but some high-class judicial cucks and will directly label are pure greed. This is irrelevant, sueing because someone else's is in danger is the legal equivalent of giving yourself momentarily the rights to this property, which outlawed. The corporates really are turning this world upside-down.</br>  <br>Avoiding the news is something that makes you feel good if the news depresses you anyway.</br>  <br><br>That is literally the most ass backwards retarded shit I've ever read. <br>And I fucking use literally sparingly.</br></br></br>  <br>I know a lot of people who have earned a beautiful letter, anon.</br>  <br> But is anybody really going to do this? <br>No one's gonna turn down free money.<br>They don't even have to directly go to court. Lawyers have been known to blackmail people in events similar to this.</br></br></br>  <br>Welcome to the glorious hybrid of capital/corporat<br><br>Enjoy your lobbying dick down your throat /a/!

Shopping behavior that they store as data, assigns to your name, and then sells to other companies.</br>  You guys doommonger too much. Once this passes, the witchhunt will start on mainstream shit first. That being music, movies, TV, video games, and the like. It'll get reported and info about the agreement will get circulated all over the world. Public backlash will fuck it up and it'll get watered down to all hell.<br><br>Maybe some doujin circles will get shat on, maybe the more mainstream anime and manga in Japan will attract some grubby third party kike, who knows? But it won't last long enough to truly kill of the doujin industry in Japan.

Japan has agreed to reduce barriers to the Japanese market for American autos, auto parts, pork and other agriculture products. Japan, it is expected, will allow a certain amount of rice, pork and other products into the country duty-free before tariffs snap back into place. <br><br>Falling ever so slowly under the Americunt dominion, I see.</br></br></br>  <br>Because they realized that doujinshi are a important part of the anime and manga industry.</br>  <br>Judging by that votation streamed a while ago not even they know what the fuck is going on</br>  <br>It has not passed just yet, they're just trying to fast track it. There is still some hope, what little that may be anyway.</br>  Can't people just boycott this garbage even if it passes? or are normies retarded enough to keep getting ripped off by corporations?  <br>My friend told me that if this passes this might be the breaking point.

The lights above her blinked and sparked out of the air. There were infected in the school. She didn’t see them, but had expected them now for days. Her note to her students were not read to and now it was too late. Far too late for now, anyway.<br>Megumi was a school teacher for fourteen months. When she was teaching she watched the highschoolers and she said to the principal “I want to be teach at the school.”<br>principal said “No! You will BE KILL BY INFECTED”<br>There was a time when she believed him. Then as she got working he stopped. But now in the Megugaoka High school of the Yokosuka she knew there were infected.<br><br><br>“This is Kurumi” the megaphone crackered. “You must find the antidote!”<br>So Megumi left her emergency manual and opened the shutter.<br>“IT GOING TO KILL US” said the Rii<br>“I will shove at him” said the Shovel and she shoved the shovel. Megumi ran at him and tried to shack him off. But then the ceiling fell and they were trapped and not able to kill.<br>“No! I must kill the zombies” she shouted<br>The radio said “No, Megu-nee. You are the zombies”<br>And then Yuki was a retard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Text in pictures isn't hard, but mspaint isn't the best so I can't help.</br>   I think Hika's a zombie. She was driven off by the other group when she received a very minor injury with the other girls following her, hence her reacting when Kurumi brought them up. The entire other group of violent hyper-pragmatists couldn't reach the food store and generator despite massive tensions due to the lack of electricity, but apparently Hika alone was able to find it - perhaps thanks to zombie stealth. That would also have been where the serum was, whether or not she's mentioned it to the others yet or not.   <br>It's a lot harder than people think.<br><br>Or at least a lot more tedious.</br></br></br>  <br>Just dropping the size and centering would improve it.

It felt like the runtime was almost twice as long as the previous two as well for some reason.</br>  <br>How is that this basically porn manga has better art than 80% of any other work?</br>  <br>How lewd is this anime?

I'm talking handholding, indirect kisses and love confessions.<br><br>No one really wants to see hardcore gay sex unless it's got a BDSM fetish and a shy, squirming bottom. We have djs and our imagination for that anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  I can't like the anime. My enjoyment from the manga depended completely on the art and the comedic timing and the anime has neither. And by art I don't mean the softcore porn, I mean the great faces everybody makes and all that.  <br>Yes, this has one of the most sexually tense handholding sessions ive ever seen. Theres no indirect kisses but there are kisses between the MC and one girl. Theres no stupid love confessions.</br>  <br> lewd <br> handholding, indirect kisses and love confessions <br>ironic shitposting is still shitposting</br></br></br>  <br>I can't wait to see what's under the white bars</br>  <br>Her tight uniform version is way better.</br>  <br> streaming </br>  <br><br><br>Prison out fit of cat suit a best</br></br></br>  Where the fuck are the RAWs for 185?    We will never see the glorious save of PBR-sama and the sacrifice of Shingo <br><br>Why live ?</br></br>  KanaHana a shit  <br>I like how if you add up all the braincells in everyone in the cast, it would still equate to zero.<br><br>Man, these people are so stupid, it's simply amazing.<br>Love the show for that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Who knows, if blu-rays sales will be high enough, we might get 2'nd season</br>  <br>You have to be really childish to think hardcore sex is lewd. By itself it's nothing more than a pleasurable way to spend your time. It only has meaning when you do it with someone you care about.<br><br>So yes, I consider handholding, indirect kisses and love confessions far more lewd. You don't even need implications of sex at that point although joking implications can be kind of sweet too.<br><br>Just watch some crappy porn or shitty hentai if that's what you think lewd means.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a better chance of Satoshi Kon coming back to life.</br>  I hope Kiyoshi converts prez from being loving women to loving  dicks   <br>Reread my post. I never said hardcore sex or anything else is lewd.<br>Just that considering indirect kisses, confessions and handholding as lewd is stupid enough to be considered shitposting.<br>Lewd is defined as crude and offensive in a sexual way.<br>In what way is any of those things "offensive", genius?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's not how it works. You should know.</br></br>  <br>Yes, but you should watch or read to find out.</br>  <br>How does it work?</br>  <br>not really, female characters are either cunts or morons (or both), nothing worthy to otp about.</br>  <br>Not to mention all the females are supporting characters. There is no female lead or anything here.</br>  <br><br>If you're gay you're gay. If your straight you're straight. You can't just change from one to the other, despite what the brochures for those camps to cure homosexuality might tell you.</br></br>  <br>Thank god.<br>Prison school's message are "women are stupid, evil, crazy or all three of them and only good for laughs and nudity"</br></br>  <br>It's messages about men are "they're all horny idiots who can't function with out seeing a glimpse of a woman's skin once every two minutes". Or it's just a comedy manga</br>  <br> comedies don't have messages </br>  <br>Not every comedy has a message, some are just for shits and giggles</br>  <br>so you agree that it being a comedy manga doesn't indicate that it doesn't have a message?  ;^) </br>  <br>Screen capping all of these; will post again at the end of the manga.</br>  <br>But wouldn't something like that be interesting?</br>  <br>Are we reading the same story?</br>  <br>Yes, are you? There is no female lead jackass. The main characters are the boys.</br>  <br>Comedic timing is gold</br>  <br>screen cap all you want, we'll see if they become bearable persons (persons, not characters, they're very fun characters already) by the end</br>  <br>This one, obviously, has an end goal. It might be the contest for the boys, but Kiyoshi, explicitly, said his was to throw away his virginity.<br><br>Also, the theme of the manga is about friendship &amp; comaderie as well as growing up. Let's not be stupid here.</br></br></br>  <br>That doesnt hold any special meaning or relevance. He said hed throw away his virginity in the middle of april, we are now in july.</br>  <br>he lost his anal virginity too anyway<br>kiyoshi can't wear white at his wedding</br></br>  <br><br>So you never read past the first arc? Because Mari alone has more panel time and impact on the plot than any boy besides Kiyoshi.</br></br>  So we all agree Mari is a slut now that she's  had fingers inside her , right?<br><br>By her own definition. I find it hilarious she said that to Chiyo while she was already aware of her future plans to  fingerbang Kate .</br></br>  <br>Might be next April.</br>  https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-11/chapter-2/<br> Someday... <br><br>  Exclusive shitposting, waifu wars and baiting thread.

Literally no one thinks it will happen, it's cliched bullshit</br></br>  <br> Saki becomes flustered not because of accidental joke confession but because she knows <br> Keika has been practicing saying Haa-chan and Saa-chan in front of a mirror in preparation <br><br> NEW HEAD-CANON, BEING DELUSIONAL IS THE BEST </br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice meme</br>  Nekopedia is best girl.<br> Why doesn't she just get a cat already? </br>  <br> now you know how it feels like to be an Irohafag </br>  Come to YY Fridays!  assuming we're dead by that time <br><br>Yukino album<br>http://imgur.com/a/b6bjZ</br></br></br>  Anons<br>It's time to leave these threads behind<br>Yahari is dead and S3 never<br>its time to move on<br>you have plenty of shows this season.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her final form will be glorious.</br>  <br>Her mom hates animals, she'd never let her have one so she embraces her Pan-san instead.</br>  <br> YY Fridays! </br>  Holy shit, these threads are still going?  <br>Orimoto Mondays then.<br><br> Preach it! </br></br></br>  <br>You have no idea .</br>   going after two guys at the exact same time when she knows other girls want said guys <br><br>Okay seriously how do people defend this fucking slut</br></br>  <br>cancer goes in all fields</br>  So when does Iroha meet Komachi in order to get info on the 8man she can use to make him hers?  <br> As soon as she learns how to breath with a severed trachea. </br>  <br>What other info does Komachi have on him that she hasn't shared with everyone before?</br>  <br>Didn't she catch him watching porn on the computer once? She can probably tell what his fetishes are from that.</br>  <br><br>His porn stash?</br></br>  <br>No the porn she found was their dad's, he watches porn on his phone then deletes it.</br>  <br>Right. Didn't Iroha take his phone in 10.5? I'm sure he covered his tracks though</br>  <br><br>Iroha would probably plant some porn mags in his room and then make a big show about 'discovering' them - and use the opportunity to make him confess to what kind he actually likes</br></br>  <br><br> he covered his tracks though <br><br>There's always a way, anon<br><br>There's always a way</br></br></br></br></br></br>  are the light novels complete?  <br><br><br>I could see her using it as an excuse to mess with the other girls<br><br>"Sempai!

But then again the Anime would've been over after 6 episodes.</br>  <br>Iroha is the hero the girls need, but not the one that they deserve. She is the architect of this romcom; all of her actions are for the purpose of making the girls or 8man take a step forward because they are too beta otherwise.<br><br>Iroha helping Yumiko:<br><br> After noticing Miura, Isshiki bowed to her. Miura nodded back. Isshiki made alternate looks between Hayama and Miura and had a fearless smirk. <br><br> Then, she placed her hands to her mouth and yelled out with a large voice, “Hayama-senpai, doooo your best! <br><br> Miura watched that quietly, but after taking a deep breath in determination, she spat it out along with her voice. “Ha-Hayato… D-Do your best!” <br><br> Her reserved voice was so small that it seemed like it could be drowned out by the cheering voices. But Hayama quietly raised his hand and of course, wore a gentle smile. <br><br> Miura watched that in a trance and slowly nodded without letting out her voice. <br><br> Isshiki watched the both of them in satisfaction. <br><br>Iroha helping double YY/8man:<br><br> “Oh, I can take the picture for you.” <br><br> “Iroha-chan, you should take a picture with us, too.” <br><br> “Yes, by all means, we can afterwards…! But first, let’s take one of everyone in the Service Club.” <br><br> Isshiki firmly refused with a smile and stretched her hand out to Yuigahama. She might’ve been acting considerate in her own way. <br><br>*Iroha decides to use 8man's phone to take the picture*<br><br> “Okay, we’ll go with this,” Isshiki said, winking and promptly readied the phone. This might’ve been Isshiki’s consideration as well. Honestly, I don’t get her at all… <br><br> As I sat there feeling dejected, Isshiki approached me and handed back my smartphone. <br><br> “Here you go, senpai… It’s a good picture,” Isshiki said, wearing a slightly mature smile.  <br><br>Truly a miracle of the universe.<br><br>However, even our dark knight has her limits. And lately, her senpai is being too sly for her and she might not be able to make these kinds of sacrifices any longer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yukino a best  <br>You forgot the secret cookies scene, when Iroha and 8man was watching over Yumiko with smiles on their faces.</br>  <br>Yukino is not genuine</br>  <br>Here is your reply</br>  <br>I didn't even know that happened<br> I seriously need to learn moon runes </br></br>    <br>Her love for cats is more genuine and purer than anything in this story.</br>  <br>Cuckino a shit.</br>  <br> implying it's not Iroha who's doing the cucking </br>  <br>I remind Spyro.</br>  <br>Why were his eyes quivering? Was the pain in his knee that intense?</br>  <br>What a shit.</br>  <br>What was Yukino thinking in that moment where they made eye contact?</br>  <br>But I will remind everyone else.</br>  <br>We need a volume from Yui and Yukino's point of views.</br>  <br><br>No<br><br>It was the pain  in his pants </br></br></br></br>  <br> His eyes are like Pan-san's. <br> I wonder if it's a hereditary trait? <br> If I asked nicely, would he dress up as Pan-san? </br></br></br>  <br>I want the entire series from Yukino's pov<br>Watching her fall in love would give my heart a boner</br></br>  <br><br>How wet is she there</br></br>  <br> I wonder if it's a hereditary trait? <br>l-lewd</br></br>  Might need to look at her Pan-san panties to find out.  <br> 8man saw her lime green bra but her panties were covered <br>There's definitely a Pan-san print there.</br></br>  <br> This guy is creepy <br> This guy is creepy <br> He has one or two positive traits, but he is still creepy <br> He is reliable  <br> Why do i even try to do things by myself when I can depend on him to do it for him. <br> Hikigaya-kun is really convenient &lt;3 </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Maybe if I kiss him here he'll be mine forever <br> Here I go <br> Ah, he backed away </br></br></br>  <br>He said Yukino, not Iroha.</br>  Yukino dragged everyone down with her shitty drama and not making her feelings clear. She made Hayama suffers from his guilt, she made Haruno suffers (Haruno must bow down to family rules while Yukino roam free), she made her mother suffers from not knowing what she wanted, she made Hiratsuka lifted her hands to deal with her problem, if Hayama still has a lingering affection to her then she also made Miura suffer, she made 8man suffers by not speaking up her mind and almost indirectly sunk her BFF's ship.  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br>This. Yuckyno a shit.</br>  <br>Hayama's guilt and suffering was his own doing, Yukino didn't like that he was still feeling guilty after all that time.<br><br>Hiratsuka only decided to help Yukino once she decided to help Hachiman.<br><br>Whatever Hayama may or may not feel is his own doing, and in doing so he is the one hurting Miura not Yukino.<br><br>She made 8man suffer the same way he made her suffer, both are idiots who refused to speak their minds.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People hurt one another by just existing in relation to one another</br>  <br>I remind you.</br>  <br>Tell me about it.</br>  <br>Is Minori really the best example?</br>  <br> She is the only girl who's willing to be my friend <br> Better repay her by stealing her crush of 2 years </br></br>  <br>Are you serious? I'm fairly sure that no matter how hard Yui tried, if 8man likes Yukino more than her then she's done. Blame 8man for leading her on for that long.</br>  <br><br><br>At this point I wonder if this isn't all an elaborate meme perpetrated by Irohafags to keep the thread bumped.<br><br><br>References to other romcoms and harems is their bread and butter since they lack compelling plot-relevant evidence to back their ship.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love how that train of thinking works.<br>Yui had feelings for a long time so suddenly that gives her exclusive rights to pursue a relationship with 8man.<br>Never mind the fact that Yukino didn't even know about Yui's feelings.<br><br>In any case it's an irrelevant issue because relationships aren't based on a point system, they're based on the strength of the connection two people share.<br><br>Also, stop trying to impersonate a Yuifag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I too can make comparisons</br>  <br>He's probably the Yuckyno poster<br>He really has nothing better to do, just keep posting best girl</br></br>  What's the whole 8man/pan-san thing supposed to mean?  <br>8man is a fish and cats eat fish though</br>  <br>delusions <br> :^) </br></br>  <br> 8man is want to be a bear <br> Yukino loves Pan-san <br> 8man has Pan-san eyes <br> He is actually the panda <br> He compares Y  umiko  to a panda<br> Miura  end confirmed</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 8man is a fish <br> Yukino is a fish <br>Fish end confirmed.</br></br></br>   I'm not as nice as you think I am. <br><br>What did she mean by this?</br></br>  <br><br>Something like this?<br><br> "This disgusting rodent, why did sensei even bring such a vile creature with fish eyes" <br><br> "He's not so bad after all.. he saw through my onee-chan's facade and he's a bit fun to banter with..." <br><br> "I thought we had the same disposition, I made a huge blunder. To think that he said he hated superficiality..." <br><br> "Why can't I do anything? What is this pain in my chest? Is it because of his insidious and superficial solutions that are making my chest hurt or perhaps it's because I can't keep seeing him commit social suicide.. impossible I've never once given heed to him.." <br><br> "I never understood what Hikigaya-kun said today, but still... there's something that tells me I should cling to it tightly.. I feel like unearthing whatever it meant could save me" <br><br> "What is this indescribable feeling I get when I get close to him? I feel uneasy.. my heart pounds at my chest and my thought process gets scrambled.. has he always looked this radiant? I need to define these perturbing feelings.." <br><br>"It's time to stop running, Hikigaya-kun had told me to solve my own problems. There is nothing to hide anymore, with this final request I should end what was wrong from the start"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How pissed would Yukino be to see 8man  holding hands  with Yumiko around school as she bosses him around  and then backs away when he retorts stuttering and mumbling like a cute tsundere. <br><br>How pissed would Hayama be when he realizes he wants genuine and finds that 8man already took it?<br><br>How happy will Ebina be knowing Hikitani is always in close proximity with Tobe thanks to Yumiko making Hikio hang around.<br><br> When will Yui hang herself upon finding out? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What satanic sacrament did Yukino perform to enchant her cookies?<br><br>What effect did the cookies have on 8man?</br></br>  <br>Yui would simply fix the problem by eliminating the source.</br>  So when does 8man dress up as Pan-san and visits Yukino's apartment? We know she'll run into her dear Panda's arms without a second thought before coming to a shocking realization.<br><br>WW is a hack so ripping this off won't be a stretch.</br></br>  <br>I remind THEM.</br>  <br>If he combines White Album 2 and Toradora it's still an original story, I guess.</br>  So who's this girl meant to be?  <br>Who are these girls meant to be?</br>  <br> 8man and Komachi's daughter <br> 8man and Haruno's daughter <br> 8man and Miura's daughter <br> 8man and Iroha's daughter <br> 8man and Ebina's daughter <br> 8man and Hiratsuka's daughter <br> 8man and Yui's daughter <br><br> 8man and Yukino's daughter </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 8man and Yukino's daughter <br> No ahoge from both families <br><br>Nice try.</br></br></br></br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;8 man and Hiratsuka's daughter<br>you mean 8man and Meguri's daughter?</br></br>  <br>Do we really need to go over this again?<br/></br>  8man is so tsundere  <br>That wasn't him being tsun, he was embarrassed because Yukino implied she had him by her side now.</br>  <br>Nope, 8man embarrased being third wheel.</br>  <br>I see this scene being used so much <br><br>Let's turn it into a gif</br></br></br>  <br><br>I think he was still feeling nervous about the intense eyefucking from earlier.</br></br>  <br><br>Unonsensual eye fucking.</br></br>  How would Yui have reacted if she saw them during the ride scene?  <br>Platonic you mean.<br><br> Am I the only one watching GDQ right now? </br></br></br>  <br>She probably wouldn't have a reaction for most of since it was just them talking, although Yukino suddenly grabbing on to him was just because Yukino was afraid.<br>There really wasn't anything to misunderstand.</br></br>  <br>125k people and you think no one else here would be watching?</br>  <br>She probably grabbed on to him because she values him as a close friend<br>She said "save me someday" to indicate she wants him to stay by her side platonically for the rest of her life</br></br>  <br>She wants him to save her but she also wants to be the one to save him.</br>  <br>How will Yukino react if 8man finds genuine  with a girl that's not her ?</br>  <br>That's such a stupid question, how would he find genuine like that  if he isn't alive. </br>  <br> implying Yukino would give up if he ends up with another girl <br>she'll respect his boundaries for sure but that doesn't mean she won't tease him and make him give into his desires</br></br>  <br><br><br>All I'm hearing is "Service Club 3P ending is the best option"</br></br></br>  If Hachiman doesnt end with Iroha he will still NTR whoever he gets with with her  <br>That's not Iroha.</br>  <br>You wish, but that wouldn't be genuine.</br>  <br>Genuine cucking is still genuine.</br>  <br>adultery isn't genuine because it involves being dishonest about your feelings.</br>  <br>He's only being dishonest about his feelings with YY, which he doesn't care much about anymore if he's NTR her with Iroha.<br>It's still genuine for the two that care about it.</br></br>  <br>I should have known better than to try and explain genuine to an Iorhafag of all people.</br>  <br> "Hikigaya-kun... I'm only doing this for your sake.. all those succubi have been corrupting your mind.. what's that? I can't hear you.. you only have to suffer a bit more.. nothing shall stand between our eternal love, it's just a matter of time before I take care of all of them. Hopefully the living conditions aren't too bad here in my closet with broken legs, but don't worry Hikigaya-kun.. I'll take care of you forever." </br>  <br>Buzzwords and baits, learn about them.<br>I had a good time - Didn't you?</br></br>  <br>Actually I want to discuss this with you. Is 8man's genuine literally being an honest guy all around and around 100% of the time?<br>Because that is kind of sounding stupid to me, I thought what he wanted was to be with people without forcing his ideas of them on them (which tbh is impossible, else these fucking kids would have solved one of the riddles of philosophy that have been going on for a while)</br></br>  <br>If he cared about Iroha more than them he would be genuine with her like he is with YY<br>He won't care enough about her to fuck her on the side when he has genuine relationship with YY</br></br>  <br>The yandere theme was truly Japan's greatest contribution to the world</br>  <br>I'll throw out one more- no it's not about being honest 100% of the time, but honesty in your relationships with other people is still the heart of the matter.<br><br>I gave up because this particular Irohafag delusion completely defies what genuine is, and  even outright states as much:<br> He's only being dishonest about his feelings with YY <br><br>if 8man wanted to be with Iroha more than one of them, he would never do it without breaking up with Yui/Yukino first, because to do otherwise would be to commit an act that is completely antithetical to 8man's moral code.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And an addendum: 8man has very, very obviously hated relationships based on superficiality and/or lies since long before Genuine, see: his various thoughts on Hayama's group since the first volume.</br></br>  <br><br>Well, no one ever commits NTR with a clear conscience.<br>Therefor, 8man will still NTR whoever he ends with with Iroha.</br></br></br>  <br>okay looks like I REALLY should have known better.</br>  <br>You somehow assume people hold an obligation to what they think.<br>Thats what you would think, but people more often than not are massive hypocrites. As a matter of fact, something to that likeness is what lead to the fucking drama which put Iroha at the front in the series.</br></br>  <br>It's a bit too late to point out bait when you've been biting for the last four or five posts, you know.</br>  <br> put Iroha at the front in the series <br>bait or delusion?</br></br>  <br>I'm just referring to  in particular, since it read like a legitimate post.</br>  <br>why not both?</br>  <br>Well, if you are an idiot then maybe not, but those who know what is good took Iroha as their favorite.</br>  <br>Irohafags are the kings of Poe's law, so we may never know.</br>  <br> those who know what is good <br>disloyal sluts are good? alright anon</br></br>  <br><br>But that would be Yui and Haruno. <br><br>Anyways Ill just let one philosopher whom I dislike a lot speak for me here:<br><br> " But she does not want the truth. What does a woman have to do with truth? From the very beginning nothing is stranger, more unfavourable, or more hostile to women than truth—her great art is the lie, her highest concern appearance and beauty. We men should admit it—we honour and love precisely this art and this instinct in woman, we who have a hard time of it and are happy to get our relief by associating with beings under whose hands, looks, and tender foolishness our seriousness, our gravity and profundity, seem almost silly." <br><br>Good night anon, Iroha is a pearl to a swine like you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Be fair anon, Iroha is a good girl. She doesn't deserve to be insulted just because Irohafags are delusional lunatics.<br><br><br> Yui <br> Disloyal <br>Like this sad sack of misfired neurons for instance.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I am a Yukinofag and I LOVE SUCKING COCKS.  <br>What?</br>  <br>We know, don't worry about it.</br>  <br>That's nice Anon but no one is really interested in your sexual orientation.</br>  <br> Yui <br> disloyal <br>heh<br> Haruno <br>seriously?<br><br>Iroha is a slut, and if the woman from your quote is Iroha, it's basically saying she isn't genuine. How exactly does 8man "deserve" her again? <br><br> Iroha is a pearl to a swine like you <br>I'm swine for sure, but she's barely a pearl if she likes multiple guys, is she? If a slut is a pearl to you then you're delusional.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Average Yukinofag, ladies and gentlemen.</br>  <br><br><br>Nice try, Yuckyno poster</br></br></br>  <br>Joke's on you.<br>Every girl in this show is a fucking dirty slut, with the excepetion of Komachi.</br></br>  <br> Hanging out alone with Taishi <br> Not a slut </br></br>  Who is this sexy beast?  <br>Don't you talk shit about Komachi, bitch.</br>  <br>The fact that Yukino did literally nothing to try and empathize with Yui still proves she's a horrible friend.</br>  <br> empathize with Yui <br>how? the fact that they like the same guy and can't express it is what put them into all this bullcrap, and it's not like Yukino can just back off, it's not genuine.<br><br> why am i even biting the bait </br></br></br></br>  <br>Still don't get this bullshit, who fuckin' cares?</br>  <br>Maybe Yui should have spoken her mind instead like she complained about how Yukino doesn't.<br><br>Yukino didn't know about Yui's feelings until the end.</br></br></br>  Yukino-chan loves Hayato  <br>What the fuck would you even empathize about?<br>Why would Yukino share her feelings about 8man with Yui at all? It would only hurt Yui more if Yukino wins him.</br></br>  <br>It's not genuine so whatever you say is invalid</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128694583 <br>Leave.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128694583 <br>Disgusting.</br>  <br>Yui and Yukino don't even communicate that intimately sure they've slept at each other's houses and spend a lot of time together but in the end they never really share anything about each other.<br>Hell 8man knows Yukino better than Yui and that's because they actually talk when they're alone.</br></br>  <br> Hell 8man knows Yukino better than Yui and that's because they actually talk when they're alone. <br>Also because he can relate to Yukino more. Yui is somewhat alien to him seeing as how she's a highly social and optimistic genki girl type.</br></br>  <br>So that's somehow Yukino's fault? I'm not sure what you're getting at exactly</br>  <br>No it isn't her fault nor is it really Yui's fault.<br>They just don't try to know each other sure they care about each other but they know nothing about each other.</br></br>   tfw 8man will never realize the right answer <br> why not both, 8man </br>  <br><br><br> “Really? I wanted to know some things though.” <br><br> “Huh? So why—“ <br><br> —didn’t you ask her? I tried to ask, but when I looked at Yuigahama’s profile, my voice withered away. Her expression as she watched Yukinoshita in the distance turn the corner of the hallway was so sincere that I hesitated from going any further. <br><br> “You see, I’m going to wait for Yukinon. I think she’s trying her best to talk to us and get closer to us… That’s why I’m going to wait for her.” <br><br> It was an answer you could expect from Yuigahama. <br><br> Yuigahama would definitely wait. It’s because she had been trying to get closer all this time. Yukinoshita fully understood this and that’s why she was trying to respond back by trying to take a step forward herself. <br><br> “But I won’t wait for people that aren’t going anywhere.” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   “I do believe that’s the worst part of human nature, though…” Yukinoshita looked disgusted. “Games, huh,” she went on, “they seem beyond my understanding as well.” <br> “Beyond your understanding, you say,” I said. “Yeah, that did show with stuff like the Pan-san game.” <br> “Huh? Pan-san? Why are you suddenly talking about Pan-san?” Yuigahama asked, a blank look on her face. <br> What, so Yuigahama didn’t know Yukinoshita liked Pan-san? Well, rather than saying she liked it, it would be better to call her a freak or a maniac or something, in my opinion. “See, the thing is-” <br> “Hikigaya-kun, what are you talking about?” Yukinoshita cut in, interrupting my sentence in quite an invasive way. <br> “Huh? What are you-?” <br> “I don’t understand what you’re saying, Hikigaya-kun… so fill me in on the details later.” <br> Man, if looks could kill. <br> “Uh, okay…” <br> Somehow, it didn’t look like Yukinoshita really wanted to make a show of how much she liked Pan-san. <br> What? Was she embarrassed? I thought she was fine with being open about it if that was the only thing she liked. And hang on, what was with her fill me in on the details later stuff? Did she want to pump me for information about Pan-san while keeping her love a secret? <br><br>Yui never found out about the Pan-san 8man gave her huh?<br><br><br><br>Problem here is Yui is still now waiting while Yukino already opened up to 8man.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm getting mixed signals here. Other than he likes having her whisper in his ear, does she likes him?  <br>I filter cock so why does this appears? Do I also have to put cocks as separate filters?</br>  <br>It's  's fault. Blame the right person, dammit.</br>  <br>Because eventually they're going to figure out which one of them 8man likes more.</br>  <br>Nah Haruno just likes to tease him.</br>  <br>At the end of the day, <br>Yui is still the one who takes the initiative. (Vol.11 Interlude chapter)<br><br>Yukino never made any effort to respond to Yui nor tries to understand Yui.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you think  Ryoko  might genuinely likes him?</br>  <br>I think Hachiman needs to be more proactive too. He really hasnt done much to bridge the gap between the girls until Yui saves the day once again.</br>  <br>A significant part of social interaction in today's singles' scene is based around weekend casual sex</br>  <br>Haruno is still pure, angry, and sexually frustrated.<br>She can't do anything that would put bad attention on her daddy.</br></br>  <br>So she only wanted Hikki to know about her pan-san fetish?</br>  I bet WW can't decide who will 8man be paired with.   No new Yahari figs at Wonfes <br>Fucking why?</br>  <br>They aren't fanservice-y enough, except for Yui.</br>  <br> except for Yui <br>Ahem.</br></br>  <br>I want to bury my face into Yukino's washboard</br>  <br><br>http://www.cracked.com/personal-exp<wbr>eriences-1518-6-weird-ways-world-lo<wbr>oks-different-when-youre-asexual.ht<wbr>m</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Kimono figures of this illustration has already been confirmed.</br>  <br>I don't remember her having a washboard, I thought she lived in really nice apartments. <br>I would assume she has a washing-machine or a dry cleaners nearby.<br><br><br>Just reminded me of that lewd elf and passive orc series.<br><br>If I could learn how to draw with a mouse or by a tablet, I'd do a version of Iroha pasting her face on all the girls in his mags.<br><br>And another one with Komachi doing the same thing and leaving a note on top of the stack of mags "You wouldn't masturbate to pictures of your imouto."<br><br><br>Thanks, y-you too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is 8man never in the YY promos?</br>  <br>Because marketing, come on now this is obvious.</br>   Mai waifu was a figment of my imagination all along <br>I don't see how anyone could seriously think Yukino could win. The series hasn't been set up for that, simply because it would cause way too much suffering to Yui and would provoke a huge backlash against the author. More importantly, the girl who's helped out 8man throughout the series and supported him wholeheartedly, if wrongly or clumsily at times, wouldn't be the one getting the short end of the stick in your normal harem series.</br>  <br>I'd love a series where characters similar to Miura and Saki are the main heroines.</br>  <br> I don't see how anyone could seriously think Yukino could win. <br>They don't. There's just a handful of people who started coming to /a/ for the sole purpose of pretending to be retarded in threads about a series that ended a month ago.</br></br>  <br>this bitch again......</br>  <br>Because Yuri Yurigahama.<br>Cookiesman was Yukino all along.<br><br>Yukino accepted her cookies and slowly accepted her "friendship".<br>Yui didn't get butthurt and left the club because 8man was on a date with Yukino, but beause Yukino was on a date with 8man.<br>Yui sleeps over at Yukino's all the time and they clearly stated that they don't talk about 8man when she does stay over.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're only fooling yourselves with those words.

People can't even be assed to shitpost, which means a lot for a series which used to be shitposting capitol of the world.  <br> People can't even be assed to shitpost <br><br>Good. However Vol 10 just released, so I thought that would catch some people's interests. Isn't Starrk still around?</br></br></br>  <br>People are around. They just don't care.</br>   tfw you probably won't live long enough to see the winner of the Ichika bowl   <br>We all know the author is forcing Houki. Just another reason a lot of people dropped the series.</br>  <br>IIRC, Electronic Brain World was so shit the translators rage-quitted after the volume was done. There is a guy working a small amount on Vol 9. <br><br>I'll scrape some money together and try to get a translation commissioned?

That Houki is the purest snowflake who never fantasizes about sex like those other harlots or would ever get caught sneaking into a boy's room.</br>  <br>Well, yeah, he created her that way.</br>  <br>The original manga ended at volume 5, there's a reboot currently being translated by rapidswitch.me</br>  Is Stark here? Any news on the next chapter?  <br><br>And he flipped out when Charlotte get too popular?</br></br>  <br>He shoved Charlotte into a corner and just made her like every girl.

I envy these people, for while their tastes are simpler, they are also more pure.<br><br>Some of us, though, keep noticing story or character elements that would be really interesting if developed or explored, and while they never are the series keeps bringing them up occasionally, as if to tease you, and just as soon as you realise, the moment has passed. I can't speak for other people, but I'm here because I'm in too deep now. This is why anyone who feels the same is hype about the YH manga, since it executes things a lot better, like allowing the characters to be actual characters.<br><br>On the matter of Ichika being dense, he wasn't, not at first. As of the first novel or three, Ichika actually had a surprising intellect and a sharp wit, as well as an actual character. He was also pretty levelheaded, especially regarding women. At some point in the novels, the author got lazy and reduced him (and everyone else) to their base harem archetypes and left them there. The anime was pretty much like that from the outset. The YH manga, incidentally, retains a degree of this characterization.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Literally just google 'Infinite Stratos Yuuki Homura'. He's the one that wrote the reboot, which you should really be reading if you haven't already.<br><br>It's, uh...pretty good.</br></br></br></br>      Found scans  <br>I want my face in that ass.</br>    <br><br>Damn, Charlotte had the best fantasy.</br></br>        <br>Are we sure that's Ichika...?</br>      <br> Laura is bottomless. <br><br>Holy shit dude.</br></br></br>    <br>Who the fuck is she? Some kinda Houki-Rin-Laura fusion?</br>    <br>Pretty sure it's Rin, they're doing cosplay.</br>  The series killed itself when it change the artist for the light novel. The new character designs are ad ugly as hell.          <br> Pretty sure it's Rin <br> breasts </br></br>  The harem grows.  <br>Madoka is cute!

Why is he crying? We need this translated.</br>  <br><br>Rather, who is that? I thought it was Charl at first, but it doesn't really look like her at the second glance.</br></br>  <br>Those 2 new characters were mentioned before when Tabane sent those drones to IS Academy for the second time where everyone had to pair off in double team fights.<br><br>If I recall, one of them is American.<br><br>However, Rin's roommate has the superior American girl while this third year American girl's character design is missing the Converse Shoes that Rin's roommate wears.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best girl</br>  <br>Maya</br>  <br>It is Yamada Sensei.<br><br>Yamada Sensei is hiding Ichika under her breasts while she takes off her glasses.</br></br></br>  <br>Agreed</br>  <br><br>Ah, thanks.</br></br>  <br>Is Chifuyu straddling Ichika while she is drunk?<br><br>Her other hand seems to right on top of his stomach.</br></br></br>  <br> Madoka supposedly looks like the spitting image of Chifuyu when she was 15 according to Ichika <br>I'm calling bullshit. How the fuck do you go from being as flat as Rin at 15 to this?</br></br>  <br>Oh damn, Pikachu is stacked.</br>  <br>Tabane technology, it worked for Houki.</br>  <br>Why is Ichika crying in Pika-tan's lap?<br><br>At least, I think it is Pika-tan?</br></br></br>  <br>Nohohon confirmed for winning the Ichikab owl.</br>  <br>Ichika's massages.</br>  <br>Why are they so beautiful?</br>  <br>It is, it looks just like her from Choco's other pages.</br>  <br>Cecilia comes off as so much smugger in Choco's art.</br>  <br>Daryl Casey is a 3rd year, Forte Sapphire is a 2nd year.</br>  <br>Some of the illustrations shown did not happen in the second season like the third year high school students or the appearance of the Italian IS pilot much less Ichika bathing with Maya and Chifuyu.<br><br>And the Second Season had Madoka teaming with her coworkers against the cast while the LN has Madoka fighting everyone by herself with no help from her fellow terrorists.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, she's Chifuyu's rival.</br>  <br>Fucking hell that's just too much<br><br>And not a single one of them is going to win</br></br></br>  <br>Chifuyu dropped out, though.<br><br>Chifuyu's real rival has always been Tabane.</br></br></br>    <br> And not a single one of them is going to win <br><br>But Chifuyu's in that picture, /a/non.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm starting to hate season 2 even more now, especially since they removed the bathing part.</br>      <br>Season 2 should have followed the novels.<br><br>Why did 8-Bit make anime original content instead.<br><br>And during that season, why did 8-Bit decide to produce and air 3 anime all in the very same season as well.<br><br>8-Bit hasn't gone full retard since then. Guess they learned their lesson but at the cost of making IS even more retarded than the source material.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  They should produce more IS OVAs and have the OVAs retcon IS Season 2.  <br>All the villains have the fancier, nicer looking ISes while all the good guys have the most vanilla looking ISes.</br>  <br>Not to mention all the Ran they cut out. They could make an entire season with what they cut out from 4-8</br>  <br>B: 91cm</br>  <br><br>I kind of want a reboot, but not very sure of it at the same time...</br></br>  <br><br><br>Looks like Chifuyu may have fought Madoka instead of Ichika fighting Madoka.<br><br>If I'm looking at the illustration correctly since I think that is actually White Knight we are seeing there and not Ichika's IS.<br><br>And in the end, Chifuyu rejected Madoka?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> gosh, anon. you're such a loser </br>  <br> Cecilia and Rin's trip to the water park <br> Student Council <br> Cecilia training and fighting Madoka <br> Charlotte's date with Ichika  <br> Using the IS to race and eventual Golum attack <br> Houki's date getting ruined by Ran <br>Yeah, they could.

No large real development.</br>  <br> SHOW MUST GO ON in corner <br>More like the charade if you can even call this series that at this point.</br></br>  <br>It's Charlotte, you can tell by the ribbon in the hair.</br>  <br>Actually I think it's the new girl.

It's Charlotte.</br>  <br><br>So I don't suppose anyone knows why there's a hand by the door...</br></br>  <br><br>I'm tempted to say that it's Charlotte due to the lack of her IS in necklace form.<br><br>Otherwise, the fact that I can't tell the difference is indicative how similar it is.<br><br>Yumizuru must be running out of character ideas. Which shouldn't a problem if he just STOPS FUCKING ADDING NEW GIRLS IN.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I think it's the new girl, notice how her ribbon is shaded, while Charlotte's normally isn't.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Neither. She just flexes her vagina muscles and the hair disintegrates.</br></br>  <br><br>Seems legit enough.</br></br>  <br><br>Go right ahead, I'll be two rooms down the hall with Maya.</br></br>  <br>I don't especially disagree with what you say, the series is pretty much going nowhere since he changed of editor but whay exatly you don't like in the linked image?</br>  I'm starting to like Cecilia. Help.  <br>Probably the QUALITY</br>  <br>No one can help you stop having patrician taste.</br>  <br><br> dream world where her greatest desires are made real <br><br> Ichika absolutely dominates her and then tries to rape her <br><br>Why is Houki so lewd?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Alas, the only worthwhile parts of season two salvaged. <br><br>Shame it got butchered the way it did.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> asshole-sounding like dialogue from Ichika <br><br>So they're basically fucking the clone...or their idealized version of him... not sure how to call it.</br></br></br>  <br>So it's NTR then.<br><br>Welp. Pack it up. Nothing to see here.</br></br></br>  <br>It's obvious that you didn't read the source material.</br>  <br><br>Are you seriously trying to claim that Houki is not a slut?</br></br>  <br>Considering the author is going out of his way to emphasize how pure Houki is, it is safe to say that she is not a slut.</br>  <br>Yes, Honne is the only one who eats and enjoys Cecilia's cooking. Though in volume 9 Cecilia starts to show improvement on cooking but only easy things that can be followed by directions.</br>  <br>New girl has dark hair and that would be shown in shading. This girl clearly has blonde or lighter hair and her hair isn't tied into a braid like Forte. <br>She's sleeping so she could have removed her IS necklace to sleep and the hair style is the same. <br><br>Maybe she finally decided to pull a Laura and go sleep in Ichika's room which looks like it's next to the girls'. <br><br>Also, for how popular Charlotte is, she hasn't done a lot for the last two volumes since the anime ended so maybe this is a way to fix that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "So, you'd like that, wouldn't you? Well, fuck you! You aren't getting it." <br>This is a good way of putting it, though sometimes it feels to me a bit more like:<br> "Hey check this out, I actually can put effort into my writing. Hah hah! Too bad for you that I'm not gong to bother though" </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I guess, now that I look at it, Forte has a bigger bust.</br>  <br>Can you imagine how terrible it would look if it was based off of Choco's art?<br><br>Though what it really needs isn't just a reboot, it needs a reboot where the author puts in some effort like he did initially rather than phone it in. Either that or for him to just give up the rights to someone gives more of a shit.</br></br></br>  <br> Also, for how popular Charlotte is, she hasn't done a lot for the last two volumes <br>Has anyone though? (besides Houki, obviously)</br></br>  <br>I'm hoping it'd be Homerun if it ever came to that.<br><br>I remember in one of the author's notes, Izuru said Homura did some things better than he did.</br></br></br>  <br>Sword had some moments.</br>  <br>They could do what Homura is doing and adapt some of the Choco changes while keeping the designs Okiura.</br>  <br>Oh yeah, I guess there was her inexplicable hospital bedroom scene from V8, plus the followup in 9 where Ichika delivers some outright falsehoods about how great she is.</br>  <br> I'm hoping it'd be Homerun if it ever came to that <br>We all are, anon. We all are.</br></br>  <br> I remember in one of the author's notes, Izuru said Homura did some things better than he did. <br>As I recall, he also said he'd have to step up his game in response. I guess we'll have to wait and see if he did (all signs point to no).</br></br>  <br>It's a shame really, she had a lot of great story potential. She's still reallyyyyyy popular though.</br>  <br> New guy blonde girl wanted to sleep with Ichika, and knocked out Laura and threw her in the hallway so she could do so <br><br>There's a scary decent chance this is what happened.</br></br></br>  Oh yeah, so I heard you guys want to waste more money on this series.  <br>It got painted.</br>  <br>I agree. Watching S1 I was struck by how good her and Ichika's chemistry was, at least in comparison to the others, and she got a big chunk of the season devoted to her. Plus, the nature of her initial relationship with him was interesting, and they had a few things in common that explored them both a little. Her being knocked back in line to be a largely interchangeable haremette was a shame.<br><br>Hell, even S2 (terrible as it was) couldn't quite move away from her character stuff. Her bit working alongside him was a neat moment, as was the brief thing with her childhood. (listen to her drama CD if you haven't already, it's a goldmine for that stuff).<br><br>...y'know, thinking about it, her character kind of revolves around him. But then they all do. And it strikes me that this doesn't have to be a bad thing. They're all (to varying degrees) damaged people looking for something to latch on to.<br><br>That's a really interesting and clever hook for a harem type series, and could've led to something spectacular if Yumizuru had bothered his arse rather than play it safe. I mean, I guess I can't blame him, but fuck; what a disappointment.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That's a really interesting and clever hook for a harem type series <br>Nigga wat. That's bread and butter for harem series. Messed up girls latching onto average everydudes because "you were nice to me".</br></br>  <br><br>These were announced at WonFes right</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but I mean deliberately, rather than that being unintentional subtext caused by shitty writing. Like making a point that the only reason these people are behaving this way is because they're messed up and need professional help.<br><br>A harem series that ended with nobody ending up with the protagonist because they all realised they were only chasing him to distract themselves from their real problems (and a lead who wants no part in a romantic relationship) would have been something I've never seen before.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, along with Azone Rin</br>  <br>I hope the other Dolfies get restocked</br>  <br>What happened to you, Hayate? You use to be really into this series and even defended it at times but all your posts this thread have just been negative and cynical.</br>  <br>It's just haremshit dude, don't blow an artery trying to analyze it.</br>  <br>Infinite Stratos just got to him, I suppose. Perhaps it's the inevitable end result for us all.</br>  <br>That's just it though; as a rule I don't analyse things, I prefer to take a work at face value and I have no patience for 'deeper meaning' or any of that bullshit. Then I watch/read IS and it keeps hinting that it could have a bit more depth and not delivering. I put my thoughts in order about this stuff back when all I'd done was watch S1, and everything I've seen since then only seemed to confirm those thoughts.<br><br>Also, I know it sounds crazy, but harem doesn't have to be bad. There's plenty of room for entertaining story or engaging characterization, it's just that most works don't aspire to be anything more than cheap T&amp;A. Which is fine too, just not in such quantity.</br></br></br>  Holy shit. My thread from last night I thought was going to slip into oblivion has survived. <br><br>I'm impressed guys.</br></br>  <br>IS threads sometimes cling to life, like an elderly relative that just won't croak.<br><br>This time it was because of the scans though.</br></br></br>  <br>That's only because of the volume 10 scans.</br>  <br>It's a very love-HATE relationship.<br><br>I love it because it gave me pic related.<br><br>I hate it because Yumizuru has proven time and time again he is a twat in every sense of the word with the delays and whining on Twitter. He has released a whopping 3 volumes since S1 first aired 4 years ago. 3.<br><br> Ishibumi has released 10 volumes of High School DXD. <br> Kamaxhi.exe has released 10+ volumes of New Testament <br> Hell even Kawahara has released a bunch of stuff for SAO and Accel World <br><br>See the pattern here?<br><br>The dude captured lightening in a bottle once and has done absolute jack fucking shit with it. The first few volumes were a bit of a mish-mash because he was still world-building, but even now there's still very little indication that the world of IS is in anything resembling a "female-dominated" society.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's a very love-HATE relationship. <br>For me it's kind of like an abusive relationship. I started with it because I was convinced there was good in it, and I don't leave because I'm convinced I can still see it every now and then. But mostly, it just batters me with a lamp.<br><br>Yumizuru may be a twat, but Homura clearly cares about the material and he's been the one putting out the most content recently. The sound stages were good too, as was the 4koma.<br><br>Basically, every IS work produced by someone other than the original creator is actually pretty good.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And that is one thing sad about IS. There is so much potential there and it is all left to the wayside. No mention of the political upheaval, the change in society from technology, or how fucked the world because the IS can only be used by women. But hey we got some great waifus.</br></br>  <br>Don't forget potential character drama ignored in favour of reducing those characters to harem archetypes. What I wouldn't give to have snarky Ichika back.</br>  <br>I'm holding out because 9 and 10 haven't been translated and all we have go by is images and they don't tell a complete story. <br>I wish Teh Ping didn't give up so easily or at least looked for help before calling it quits. But he's strange and I think IS just isn't for him. <br><br>I do however wish IS to end, I feel for a harem it has gone on long enough. You can only do so much with a harem which I feel is why he introduces new characters every other chapter to fill in roles to keep it going. But 10 is a good spot to start winding down and ending the series. If he hates it as much as people believe he does, he would try to end it but I feel publishers give him enough money to keep going. It's hard to turn down a ton of money.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just want it to quietly die rather than live like an Alzheimers patient, huh? Well, I can't blame you. <br><br>I think there's still time to decide to have an actual story (be it plot or character driven), but he's certainly left it a while to really start with that.<br><br>What it comes down to is that judging by his early work on the series) he could certainly have written such a story from the get go. But he lost his passion for it and was reduced to shitting out whatever drivel he could be bothered to to keep the money coming in. <br><br>About the best you can hope from him is that seeing the quality of Homura's work lit a fire under his ass and drove him to do better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   They switched to CHOCO <br><br>I want to see IS as illustrated by  Raita </br></br>  I guess its too much to have an ending where the government encourages Ichika to breed all of them, even his sisters, in the hope he can pass on whatever allows him to pilot an IS to more male children.    Hayate, you still here?  <br>I had no idea the manga was a reboot. I'll check it out, but why'd they decide on a reboot?</br>  <br>Publisher switch.</br>  <br>Because the art for the original manga was trash.</br>  <br>Fuck no, I just imagined it and it's fucking ugly.</br>  <br>Oh when you said reboot, I thought literally the world was rebooted</br>  <br>I'm always here.</br>  <br>I just want to ask, why is Cecilia such a slut?</br>  <br>I got to say, I admire your dedication doing that as long as you have.</br>  <br><br>Wasn't she supposed to be some kind of badass in season two?<br><br>What happened?</br></br></br></br>  <br>She became a slut.</br>  <br>S2 happened.</br>  <br>I say that one of the reasons Homerun Ichika is so good is that he's very much alike the early LN Ichika. If the anime &amp; entire LN had Ichika be the same as his early LN self, it'd be plenty better.</br>  <br><br>serves you right for listening to noveltroll</br></br>  <br>She was shown to have no morals when she poisoned/blew-up her betters.</br>  <br>It wasn't a troll, she was suppose to fight Madoka while she was in Silent Zephyr because it's Blue Tears' sister unit. She gets her ass beat and then she trains and learns to bend her laser beams and fights her again.</br>  <br>Kanzashi happened.<br><br>They rushed a bunch of shit so they could introduce her, including most instances of anything that could be considered character development for most of the girls (save Houki of course). S1 was 3 volumes of content. The first half of S2 was 4-6 with a bunch of stuff skipped (Ran, Ichika being part of student council, you name it) so they could get Kanzashi in and make money off of her being the nerdy anime-liking girl.<br><br>So shit like Cecilia training to bend beams was skipped, and instead of winning albeit a Pyrrhic one against Madoka like she did in the novel, she had to job in the anime so not only could Kanzashi diffuse the bomb, but so Ichika + Houki could stop the big bad and end the season.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not take spoilers. It's true. She has a fire everything at once move that's like a 1 shot kill that damages herself also and can bend lasers.</br>  <br>Kanzashi a best girl, though.</br>  <br><br>They cut it to make room for the episode about Char's pantsu</br></br>  <br>That episode made it AOTS.</br>  <br>But I liked the Valkyria Chronicles art.</br>  <br>Why is Houki so violent?<br>Why is Tabane so crazy?<br>Why is Rin so flat?<br>Why is Tatenashi so Mary Sue?<br><br>The world may never know.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I almost purged that episode from my mind, why you do this to me.</br>  Devil's Advocate time<br><br>Praise something about season two no matter how much you hated it overall<br><br>I for one thank it for giving us a new round of doujins</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sauce?</br>  <br><br>it gave us foxgirl shrine priestess Houki<br><br>Which I think we can all agree is best Houki<br><br><br><br>Because I refuse to suffer alone</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wonder if there will be a another season of this.  probably not    <br><br>I'd rather a reboot at this point with a different studio</br></br>  <br>Stonking great tits.</br>  <br><br>These two</br></br>  IS is interesting as messy rom-com stuffs that are mostly equivalent to side-stories or short-stories are much more focused compared to any other drama or actual story development, unlike any other armor-featured series <br>It works for me but  I welcome anyone who can convince me that this is not the actual selling point </br>  <br> Chifuyu-nee will never ride you fast and hard <br><br>Why live</br></br></br>  Ichika's a good guy, better than I remember. I don`t remember this from the anime though, it`s been 4 years, afterall.  <br><br>He did protect Houki from the bullies in the first season. So he's pretty nice despite being dense.</br></br>  <br>Original content from Yuuki Homura. Just like how Akahoshi Kenji show Cecilia's past.</br>  <br><br> not accidentally grabbing his raging boner <br><br>Missed opportunity</br></br></br></br>   Such a lovely child cannot be a girl <br>Best doujin.</br>  <br><br>I'm for any doujin where Ichika gives it to Char i9n the butt while still thinking she's a guy</br></br>  <br>Homura is a Houkifag though.</br>  <br><br>So?<br><br>The creator is too<br><br>Just be glad the show runners were all Char-fags</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone should be a Charfag</br>  <br> Just be glad the show runners were all Char-fags <br>Why did they make such a disservice to her in S2 then?</br></br>  <br>It's not as bad as you make it sound.

Even with the changes?</br>  <br>maybe but how would they continue it on a remotely decent note with all the cutting done? that and I think IS has fallen out of favor even with japan.

He's always been the nee-san type considering how many h-manga involving incest he's drawn. I think he likes Chifuyu more.</br>  <br>From the looks of it, I don't think the nips really cared for that aspect. Not many series reach the 20k threshold, especially with all the changes that season 2 brought.</br>  <br>Oh and accurate numbers.<br><br> 23,566 *1 IS: Infinite Stratos 2 [BD+DVD]: 2013/10/30 </br></br></br>  <br>Not denying he has favorites, but he doesn't let it get in the way of the writing both the manga and his other IS doujin stuff (non-H). Otherwise he wouldn't have bothered with that Tanned Rin short doujin.<br><br><br>Twilight sold alot, does that make it a good story? NOPE.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The nips are weird, you've all come to the conclusion they buy this just for their favorite girls right? Though that can apply to other series.</br>   new Blade Dance novel <br> new IS novel <br>Is this real life?<br>New Haruhi novel soon?</br></br></br>  <br>Ah fuck yea this was a terrific picture</br>  <br>there's limits to that, especially with how S2 was basically the Fake russia season. Then again there's a reason why the phrase "japan has shit taste" is largely said.<br><br><br>It still hasn't come out yet? perhaps it's just as well as that has definitely fallen out of favor.</br></br></br></br>  <br> there's limits to that, especially with how S2 was basically the Fake russia season. Then again there's a reason why the phrase "japan has shit taste" is largely said. <br>But Sword-chan is fucking great.</br></br>  <br>As a girl herself, she isn't exactly terrible, the real issue is all the sueness surrounding her.<br><br>I also realized part of why S2 might have sold: they might not have known better, that sort of thing happens with adaptions: the original content gets obscured. That and/or hope that it went in a better direction than the novels.</br></br></br>  <br>Char is the most popular, everyone loves her, just focus on her and it prints money.<br>But no, they fucked it up and ruined Char just to spite us and gave us a lackluster spin off manga to rub it in.</br></br>  <br>Well, it did take 9 years for Crest of the Stars to get a new volume.</br>  <br>Waaaaaaaaaaaaah<br>Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah</br></br>  <br> gave us a lackluster spin off manga <br>Hitsuji Takako is a Charfag himself, seeing that he was doing Charl doujins before he was tasked to do Sugar &amp; Honey.<br><br>You said it yourself<br> Char is the most popular, everyone loves her, just focus on her and it prints money <br>to play it safe and not kill the golden goose, put out a Charl spin-off done by a Charl-fag.<br><br>I guess that's how low the people behind IS thinks about its fans. After all, they did put out a VN where the best end is just a reset end. A fucking cop-out compared to Toradora or OreImo where the MC can hook up with someone else other than the titular character in the epilogue.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if the new game will fix that or if they're just adding new mechanics like the massaging and Tatenashi and Kanzashi routes.</br>  REMOVE BROOM  <br>Damn, Char sure has a serious case of back rash.</br>  <br>I wouldn't get your hopes too high.</br>  <br>Tatenashi and Kanzashi already have routes in the first game. It's just that there's a hierarchy/priority system in place that you will go to the route of the girl with a higher placement if you maxed out the affection of two or more girls.</br>  This is Kanzashi.  <br>Broom a cute! (when she isn't trying to smash your head in)</br>  <br> when she isn't trying to smash your head in <br>But that's everybody aside from Kanzashi.</br></br>  <br>that varies depending on what material; LNs?

Somebody’s on the bed next to me.<br><br>“…”<br><br>I opened the curtain without hesitation, and saw Tatenashi-san, putting on her shirt without wearing a bra.<br><br>Boing, the busts are still as nicely curved as before—<br><br>“WAAAAHHH!? I’M SORRY! I’M SORRY!”<br><br>I hurriedly pull the curtain back, but it’s too late. The lance of the IS ‘Mysterious Lady’ immediately stabs over.<br><br>“I, chi, ka, kun~? This onee-san won’t allow for anything like this, you know…”<br><br>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry! Tell me to do whatever you want me to do, so please forgive me!”<br><br>The lance immediately stops.<br><br>“You’ll do anything?”<br><br>…Geh, I’m dead.<br><br>“Y-yes, anything that can actually happen in reality…”<br><br>I affirm tentatively.

Prove me wrong.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jMo<wbr>VmSV4yA8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>    <br>best ed too</br>  <br>I just caught up with the anime after getting some time, but compared to the LNs it's quite lacking.<br><br>Those certain scenes were great though, but as far as an actual anime goes it's at least as bad as Mahouka and Vanadis was, actually probably worse.<br><br>Is it weird of me to think that to properly get everything right they would need to like, slow the pace down even more? As it is they are cutting away dialogue or exposition at every turn just to make it in time but I also understand that lots and lots of talking would bore casuals even if they come complete with diagrams or flash backs during monologues and what not. Ah fuck it there's no point wondering about what could have been when this is clearly a cheap commercial where the budget is focused on certain scenes and being an outlet for So-Based to draw some more shit. Guess I'm happy with that.<br><br>Wonder how BDs will work though, it doesn't seem like they are censoring much, what would it even offer to make people buy it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's Auto-tune, so by default, it's garbage</br>  <br>I haven't watched much this season, but I remember when the first PV trailer came out I thought it was absolute shit due to how it was horribly out of place with the animation and the song started without the proper build up.<br><br>It's great in the OP though.</br></br></br>  <br>The LN's have way too much text talking about ''this skill and that skill and that item'' but ultimately its useless since Momonga is the only one who is aware of it.</br>  <br>Welcome to LN adaptations, they can't just put all the monologuing in or it'd take up an entire episode.</br>  <br> Getting to about a 700000 views in about 3 weeks. <br>How?</br></br>  <br>people like a good power fantasy see<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6Bd<wbr>b1V0Io_g</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Yeesh, and that's just the preview?</br>  <br>I hope the opening is gonna be dope too</br>  Is it time for<br><br> KOTAE WA DOKO EEEEEEEEEEEEE? </br></br>  <br>SAGASHITEEEEEEEE</br>  <br>Why is it useless? There's tons of context to it that change how you would interpret the scene itself. This is proven by how many shitters there are in these threads since the anime started asking for explanations.<br><br><br>Yes I know this isn't my first LN, however I can safely say that compared to other adaptations Overlord seems the least capable of being self contained when cutting away content. I think the best examples of this are SAO and Raildex, where even though I know there's a shit ton of things I missed out since I've read the LNs first, it's not all that awkward for whatever reasons.<br><br>Might just be how Overlord was written I dunno. Not saying it's bad, just saying as a stand alone anime instead of being a highlight reel it's awfully jarring. I'd be completely lost if I didn't read the LN and get misconceptions everywhere.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>it actually looks creepy</br></br>  <br>With my soul</br>  <br> reads shitty shounen lns <br> complains about adaptations <br>nigga</br></br></br>  <br> Why is it useless? There's tons of context to it that change how you would interpret the scene itself. <br><br>Nah from what I read its mostly useless shit noone cares about. (muh skills muh stats).<br><br> This is proven by how many shitters there are in these threads since the anime started asking for explanations. <br><br>They ask about things not yet explained, understandable since its still early. <br><br><br>All in all I believe the anime is really good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't feel like that at all when I watched, neither did my friends who had never even heard of Overlord.</br>  <br> I'd be completely lost if I didn't read the LN and get misconceptions everywhere. <br><br>literally everything is explained<br><br>what the hell is your problem?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I pointed out adaptations that I thought were self contained, and coincidentally, they were the ones that sold very well. Probably because being self contained allows an adaptation to reach a new audience. I mean your very picture is an example of that which I missed.<br><br><br>We'll just have to agree to disagree then, cause if I'm going to be honest I flat out disagree with your post but I'm not gonna bother going back through vol 1 line by line for this. Feel free to BTFO of me though if you are inclined to start quoting lines for each scene though.<br><br><br>I don't see how that's possible when you cut half the text in quotation marks out, not even counting the text not in quotations.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Were you raped by a skeleton when you were young?</br>  <br> I don't see how that's possible when you cut half the text in quotation marks out, not even counting the text not in quotations. <br><br>because anime is about pictures, not text</br></br></br>  <br>I did wear a skeleton costume when I was a little kid.</br>  while re-reading vol 1 of the LN I noticed that Ainz defined a minor potion as an item that "only" restores 50 HP... but that cannot be as his total HP is 60 and even his strongest level 100 physical class servants cap at 100 HP. so what am iI missing? did the author retconned his shit?  <br>You do know I was referring to dialogue right? The characters talk when that happens.</br>  <br>The 60 is not 60 hp. It's more like 60% of the normal soft-cap so to speak.</br>  <br>ah ok thanks, that makes sense</br>  <br> kid inside skeleton as opposed to skeleton inside kid <br>Beat them at their own game, eh? That's sheer genius.</br></br>  <br>Yeah we don't know exact numbers anon, nor how the stat chart really works. But you can see how fucked up Ainz's mana bar is when it literally goes off the section.</br>  <br>Is Overlord any good?</br>  <br>What happens if the skeleton inside your body tries to kill you?</br>  <br>I think it's called 'bone cancer'.</br>  <br>spooky</br>  <br>there's something else that baffles me: I used to think that the battle maids were the strongest NPC group after the guardians, Sebas and Pandora's actor but then in volume 4 we learn of the existence of cocytus' level 100 servants who are supposedly stronger. so how many damn level 100 NPC are in Nazarick? also, as we know that Ainz can conjure level 80+ monsters, is it safe to say that battle maids are useless power wise?</br>  <br>AOTD</br>  <br>Too spooky for me.</br>  <br>I don't know where you get level 100 from, cause I've never read anywhere that Nazarick has level 100 nameless npcs other than possibly the Avatara.<br><br>However, there are plenty of level 90 npcs, like the dragons Aura and Mare ride. Demiurge's 7th floor supposedly has a level 90 that is stronger than the weaker floor guardians giving you a glimpse of how RP-mode Nazarick actually is when it doesn't involve the 8th floor.<br><br>If you read the first vol you should know that the battle maids are merely there to stall time on the 9th floor along with Sebas while the players of AOG revive at the 10th floor in order to make their last stand in a Final Boss fashion.</br></br></br></br></br>  Choose your destiny.    <br><br>Whoa, that's too spooky anon.</br></br>  What qualifies as a non human? Touch Me is just a guy with a mask, another dude is a birdman  <br>Touch me is draconian.</br>  <br>Has it actually been confirmed?</br>  <br>Ghost Skeleton<br>Top Hat<br>Flight<br>Time Travel<br>Underwater Ruins<br>Kelly Goldstein<br><br>Dr. Bones<br>Fitz<br>Patches<br>Diary<br>Lesbian Rally<br><br>It'd be an amazing adventure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not in the translated novels so far at least.</br>   Justice has Arrived. <br><br>How much did this special effect cost I wonder.</br></br>  <br><br>Why was his name Touch Me?</br></br>  <br>is that really enough to be a non human? It's like hey I might look totally like a human but I'm actually a nymph :^), whats the point</br>  <br>The point is that you get extra stats with the disadvantage that people can murder you at no penalty.</br>  <br>Delet this</br>  <br>Normal Skeleton<br>Top Hat<br>Magnetic Bones <br>Time Travel<br>Spooky Tomb<br>Mayor Smith<br><br>Patches<br>Dr.Bones<br>Ezekiel<br>Diary<br>Lapsed Rapist</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't know where you get level 100 from <br>I misread that, it is only stated that Cocytus' nameless servants are stronger than Entoma.</br></br>  <br>that sounds pretty fun</br>  <br>2spooky4u?</br>  <br>Shimoneta has a narration break in the intro to similar to 80's action tv shows.</br>  <br>Is Ainz greatest threat  osteoporosis ?</br>  <br>That sounds like a world class item. So I guess his fears were true after all.</br>  <br>I doubt I'll sleep tonight after seeing this.</br>  <br>The maids are formation fighters, on their own they crumble really fast but together they'll make you stand in one place until the big boys manage to put their boots on.</br>  <br>He probably a fan of Rocky Horror Picture Show.</br>  <br>Which is really weird cause their youngest resides on the only floor that matters. I wonder if she just acts as a cheerleader then books it downstairs when things go bad getting the girls ready.</br>  <br>then don't open this image, I warned you</br>  <br>Overlord is one of the best horror/thriller anime I have seen in my life. So spoopy.</br>  <br>What benefits would being a fishman would give?</br>    Where does Albedo put her wings while she is in full armor?  <br>up her butt</br>  <br>Probably shouldve guessed that given the fact that shes a huge slut.</br>  <br>Only for Momonga-sama</br>  <br>I was waiting for this!</br>  Stream where?  <br> streaming </br>  <br>neetball?</br>  <br>Fuck you buddy.
