It had Starry in it and the three girls were idols in Akiba.</br>  <br>soruce?</br>  <br>Found it<br>https://www.mangaupdates.com/series<wbr>.html?id=120211</wbr></br></br>  <br> In the gateverse it all took was some humane treatment to win over most of the gatepeople. <br>On the other hand, it made a peace treaty 100% harder. The Empire ended up mistaken Japan's desire for peace as a sign that the JSDF has major weaknesses. Because they don't understand why an army with such advantages don't just sack the Capital. Thus most assumed Japan is bluffing.</br></br>  <br>Well all it takes is just taking some high ranking people to show what Japan is like to convince them they're strong but desire peace. And they did exactly that.</br>  <br>That's actually really funny.</br>  <br> Because they don't understand why an army with such advantages don't just sack the Capital <br> tens of thousands of troops die in completely one-sided battles, with absolutely nothing to show for it <br> WE'RE OBVIOUSLY WINNING GUYS. LET'S GO IN FOR THE KILL. </br></br></br>  <br> &gt;tens of thousands of troops die in completely one-sided battles, with absolutely nothing to show for it <br>The point is the Capital is unharmed. It makes no sense, to them, that an invincible army would AVOID conflict. So the conclusion is that the JSDF has some unknown weakness and that is why they want a peace treaty so badly.</br></br>  <br>Just to elaborate, in the ancient world you sign peace treaties if you are exhausted and don't see any chance of defeating your foe. You don't start talking peace unless you worry about not being able to win. The Romans simply suffered from cultural clash and misunderstood what the JSDF was doing.</br>  I've been wondering, how do they power lights in the capital? A generator out the back would create too much noise and constantly shipping in charged batteries would take a lot of effort.  <br>If it's not generators, powerline directly from the base ?</br>  <br>Is my absurd attraction to Kuri soley based on the fact that she sort of resembles Lili from DanMachi even though Kuri's already a better character?</br>  <br>Solar panels are a thing together with car batteries.</br>  <br><br>Just imagine how GATE would've played out if the Gate opened up in Showa-era Japan (Pre-WWII). There'd be a fuck-ton of raping, pillaging, torturing, executing, etc. Shit'd be brutal.</br></br>  <br>Well at least it would mean Japan wouldn't be involved in WWII, and they'd have a chance to rape and pillage some other world instead, for a while.</br>  <br> Just imagine how GATE would've played out if the Gate opened up in Showa-era Japan (Pre-WWII). There'd be a fuck-ton of raping, pillaging, torturing, executing, etc. Shit'd be brutal. <br>Err... That's normal for the Empire, so nothing they don't already do.</br></br>  <br> Imperial Japan conquers a whole fucking world and enjoys untold amounts of resources and is ultimately able to conquer most of Asia, as the US would never be attacked due to them being able to find an untapped oil reserve in the not-Rome. </br>  <br>I mean the Japanese would rape and murder everyone they come across. The Empire would be shitting itself scared instead.</br>  <br> and is ultimately able to conquer most of Asia <br>Why would they even do that? Why take China when the Empire is weaker and bigger?</br></br>  <br>Or America in the 60s seeing how barbaric our soldiers were in Vietnam. <br>Or Korea in that era seeing how brutal they were in Nam as well.</br></br>  <br> I mean the Japanese would rape and murder everyone they come across. The Empire would be shitting itself scared instead. <br>Err... THE EMPIRE DOES THAT TOO.<br>That is NORMAL to them. You must be confused, the Empire has no problem with torture, rape or murder by soldiers.

Dunno, the Aquarion series still exists.  aldnoah wasn't bad compared to some other mechas, but it was the biggest waste of a budget ever<br><br>aldnoah's budget was similar to fate/stay night and wtf did they spend it on? that garbage cgi?</br></br>  That's the one that had character designs by Shimura Takako, right? Sucks that it sucks, I was planning on watching it eventually.  <br> aldnoah.zero <br>You got it.  It was worse than GSD. </br></br>  That's not M.D. Geist 'Colon' Deathforce  Who's the cuck on the bottom right?  G Reco  GSD&gt;VVV&gt;A/Z  Captain Earth is worse.  <br>CE has Bones traditional animation at least. It's not overwhelmingly beautiful like Star Driver and E7 but it's still pretty nonetheless. Shitnoah Zero has ugly as shit CGI mechs.</br>  <br>Aldnoah was mecha?</br>  <br>Better than G Reco.</br>  Dai Shogun is worse<br>Also, Ginguiser</br>  <br>I don't get everyone who says Aldnoah's animation was shit. Have you innocent virgins never seen actually bad animation before?</br>  A Wakening of Trailblazer is the worst  <br> CE has Bones traditional animation at least. <br>That just makes it worse. The fact they wasted all that beautiful animation and great OST on boring trash that goes nowhere and does nothing. Writing that assassinates any possibly tension, character drama that is preemptively resolved before it can get interesting. Pitiful attempts at fanservice neutered by Bones' prudish standards. <br><br>CE is a waste of everyone's time, including Bones'.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At least it looked decent, that shitty mecha this season is far worse.</br>  <br>You actually thought that drab CG looked good?</br>  Evangelion  Aldnoah was FUN  <br>What, you mean the generic as fuck one starring les SAO man?</br>  <br>Cuck of the year.</br>  <br> all those mechashows in the season <br> so much hype was build up <br> most of them werent as good as expected <br> mfw </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> mecha <br> ever good </br></br></br>  <br>No idea, that with the 50 min first episode, not that I watched even half of it.

I don't watch mecha a lot but most of the modern mecha shows that I've seen are garbage, Frontier is the only one I really loved (and is not even completely mecha, it's more half mecha half idol anime).  <br>Nah, same shit as Kill la Kill, it just somehow got extremely hyped. It's still plain bad.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128628820 <br> Only watched 3 episodes <br> Thinks he can judge the entire show <br>Keep being retarded and shitposting</br></br></br>  <br>Valvrave was fun to watch with /a/. Stupid shit can still be fun. <br><br>CE is just boring though. Nobody had fun with it. Animators worked their fingers down to bloody nubs doing the action and transformation sequences and it just turned out so fucking dull. You could conceivably skip every action sequence in CE and not miss anything important. That's how bad it was.</br></br></br>  <br> Frontier is the only one I really loved <br>Opinion disregarded</br></br>  <br>Code Geass</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128628937 <br>Thing is, you can't say it's overrated just because you don't like the first few episodes, when it gets really great later on</br>  <br>People actually thought Kill La Kill was good though. However KlK was also really fun to watch. <br><br>Everyone knew Cross Ange was shit but watched it anyways because it was hilariously bad. <br><br>The only way they're similar is they were both fun rides with shitty writing. The reasons they're fun to watch is completely different and in terms of actual quality Cross Ange is much lower.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shin Mazinger and SRW OGIN</br>  <br> last ten years <br>Eureka Seven</br></br>  <br>Koutetsushin Jeeg</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128628937 <br>Then you say it didn't impress you, you didn't see enough to say it's overrated.

I could watch KlK while Cross Ange was so bad I just couldn't watch it, I even tried picking it up again at episode 16 or so but had to drop it after some minutes. Utter shit. I'd say that Aldnoah Zero is better than both.</br>  <br>Yeah...3 months ago</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128629286 <br> G gundam is a tournament <br>You couldn't be more wrong</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128629286 <br> G gundam is a tournament <br>The part you watched.

Worst mecha series in recent memory is probably M3 The Dark Metal.</br></br>  <br><br>I'd say best mecha period including everything is Gundam Unicorn. Best mecha on TV is probably Knights of Sidonia.</br></br>  <br>Goddannar</br>  <br>Vulvarape is probably the worst</br>  <br><br>Definitely the most massively overhyped one for what it ended up delivering. Remember this is the series that Aniplex constructed and assembled another super team of popular creators (only one of which had any remote experience or insight into mecha anime and left the project 3 episodes in) ala Madoka Magica to try to start a franchise that would in it's presidents own words supersede Gundam. It's like they thought literally all they needed was a magic quartet of Urobuchi, Sawano, Aoki and Kajiura with their darling Sora Amamiya as the female lead and everything else would magically just fall into place.<br><br>Granted it worked for a while and then Butcher fanboys found out he wasn't writing the scripts anymore and TIMBEEEEEEEEEER!!!! Realistically that's all it took, like the show was actually charting really well before he confirmed his level of involvement on twitter and various conventions. If Aniplex had just kept that in check and tried to act like he was still writing the scripts maybe things would have turned out differently at least financially for the series. As it is now it will probably sell worse than even G-Reco which it's creator actively tried to sabotage commercially which is hilarious.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Valvrave was fun, especially with /a/ though</br>  <br>The amount of hype and self-glorification was beyond ridiculous for what the show ended up being.</br>  <br> I'd say best mecha period including everything is Gundam Unicorn </br>  <br>Shin Mazinger Z a best</br>  Aldnoah.Zero have some serious problems, especially on it's second half.<br><br>It's still not as bad as Gundam Seed Destiny though. Actually everything that is bad on AZ, Gundam Seed Destiny is able to do worst.</br></br>  <br> episode 16 <br>There's your problem. DRAGON world was the most boring part of the show.</br></br>  <br> If Aniplex had just kept that in check and tried to act like he was still writing the scripts maybe things would have turned out differently at least financially for the series <br>No sane person would approve of this kind of shit writing we had in A.Z.

No Akino or inserts, but it's been getting better each episode and the cast has been more likable than EVOL's. You get used to the character designs fast.</br>  <br>Yea thats kind of why that other comment kinda triggered me. I also actually like the cast and the themes.</br>  I gotta say I was avoiding mecha for a long ass time and I've just started watching Gundam 0080 war in the pocket and it's been pretty damn good. Apparently Zeta Gundam is even better?  It's not so bad compared to the really horrible crap like Gundam AGE, G-Reco or Dai Shogun. <br><br>It's in the same tier of mediocrity with the likes of Valvrave, Majestic Prince and Sidonia.</br></br>  <br>That's not MLA: TE.</br>  <br> Gundam AGE <br><br>Isn't that the Gundam that was so horrific that Bandai pretends that it doesn't exist?</br></br></br>  <br><br>0080 is the best Gundam<br>Zeta Gundam tries too hard to be mature and and ends up being a mess of a show</br></br></br>  <br>Valvrave was watchable unlike aldnoah zero.</br>  <br><br> G Reco <br> crap <br><br>Here's your reply</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This unit is PANICKED and used HUNKER DOWN.</br></br>  <br>Aldnoah zero was complete shit. Valvrave has it's flaw but it was a lot more fun to watch than Inaho shit.</br>  <br>It's pretty bad tbh and only Tomino-fags defend it to death anyway.</br>  <br><br> wanting more reviews from a guy who think KnK is one of KyoAni's best works </br></br>  <br><br>Both are shit. I wonder when this "G-reco is an misunderstood masterpiece" meme will stop...</br></br>  Aldnoah S2 could've been much, much better but I suspect they would've needed more episode and more time to properly write them.<br><br>It's pretty funny that the series was hammering home how UNDERSTANDING wasn't going to stop the war, but Peace Princess and Prince I Fucked Ur Waifu show up and magic the entire war away using the magic of DIPLOMACY and UNDERSTANDING.</br></br>  <br>Funnily enough, I dont even remember the ending of A/Z S2 but quite clearly remember how the first season ended.</br>  <br><br> That description <br><br>So it is like Top Gear,  ambitious but rubbish </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>You have to rewatch G Reco three times, then you will understand why is a masterpiece ahead of its time.</br></br></br>  <br>Calling AZ ambitious is a bit much, it's pretty much just a combination of mecha tropes that never goes anywhere.</br>  <br>It definitely was ambitious<br>The staff were saying stuff like "it will surpass Gundam" before it aired ,and hyped it to death<br>Of course , it ended up being shit</br></br></br>  <br>AKB0048,Inb4 idolshit.</br>   yfw Majestic Prince   <br>This is the biggest waste of potential I have ever seen.<br>Its literally the most ambitious show ever made but fuck it we suck.</br></br>  <br>Fafner</br>  <br><br>That's Hino fault because he cannot into writing TV shows due to him using video game writing logic, and let's not forget this gem:<br><br> Made ambitious goal that the PSP games tie-in would sell 1 million copies <br> Sold less than 10% of its target (both games sold around 70k combined) </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Worst. When fucking Gundam V exists.</br></br>  I don't know, g-reco was pretty fucking bad  <br>The staff had ambitions but the work itself did very little to back that up.</br>  A/Z and Build Babies Try are easily the worst  <br> hating on V gundam </br>  <br>Hino sucks at writing video games. Who's bright idea was it to give him control over something he has no experience with?</br>  Yeah Aldnoah Zero or Captain Earth for sure, Two if the biggest jokes.<br><br>Mecha genre is fucking dying anyway, It's too predictable and boring that no one wants to do it any more apart from Gundamn stuff.</br></br>  <br>ufotable did Kara no Kyoukai though.</br>  <br>KnK as in Kyoukai no Kanata.<br>Kudos for thinking of Kara no Kyoukai though.</br></br>  <br><br> wanting more worthless opinions from an Urobuchifag </br></br>  <br>That's actually the joke. If you were to say something like "I'm so fucking mad that Bones screwed over ZnT", I would have said "But J.C Staff/Mappa did Zero no Tsukaima/Zankyou no Terror!”. It’s not really that funny, but the point still stands.</br>  <br><br>From WONFES.</br></br>  <br>Star Driver</br>  <br>I absolutely love 0048 but have a very difficult time calling it a mecha show. It has mecha in it, sure, but it's a pretty minor aspect of the show.</br>  <br> Urobuchifag <br>If that were the case wouldn't he have mindlessly given Aldnoah a 10/10 just because Butcher worked on the first couple episodes?</br></br>  <br>Did you watch the video? Half of it was spent apologizing for Urobuchi's involvement. He claimed the reason it sucked was because Urobuchi wrote a few episodes, outlined the plot, and then fucked off.</br>  <br>The first couple of episodes were pretty okay. Bellybutton magic was fantastic. After that, it all kind of petered out in a pathetic manner though. Not even those glorious handdrawn mecha fights could keep me there.</br>  <br>Linebarrels was good.</br>  <br>I liked A/Z.</br>  <br><br>G-Reco was complete and utter shit.<br><br>Turn A was the last truly excellent gundam, unless you count build fighters (I don't, mainly because they're dumb, exciting fun and nothing more).</br></br></br></br>  <br>God, Doga Kobo just gets shit done. I really can't wait for them to do another mecha anime.</br>  I didn't have a problem with Aldnoah Zero and I loved the ending because it was (kind of) out of nowhere. And then they made season 2, and THAT is one of the worst mechas I've ever seen. The only one that comes to mind next to it is Gargantia and I haven't even finished it yet.<br><br><br>Evangelion 2.22</br></br></br>  <br>I think Hino is great for concepts, but after he makes the initial idea, lock him out of the writing room. <br><br>AGE infuriates me with how great it could have been. A generational Gundam could have been incredible. I thought the mechanical designs were pretty good too. AGE-3 is fucking sexy as all hell. But it all goes to shit in the most embarrassing way possible.</br></br></br>  <br>Orange did the CG in MJP, didn't they?</br>  <br> Evangelion 2.22 <br>It doesn't really hold up that good compared to the original TV series, though.</br></br>  <br>I think you meant "best mecha ever made". Either that or you've gone full retard.<br><br>I mean, <br><br>Aquarion<br>Valvrave<br>Nobunaga the Fool<br>Daimidaler<br><br>and those four are just the trainwrecks I've personally witnessed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is M3 good? I'm on episode 4 and so far I'm staying for the hilarious Okada quotes  <br>It doesn't hold up to fucking Bayformers, I don't know what Lelouch is on about.</br>  <br> Lelouch <br>That's Jebus, even he's less obnoxious than Lecunt.</br></br>  g reco's initial episodes were pretty terrible and then Sage died so I just dropped it.<br><br>Tomino shouldn't have embarrassed himself with that show. The only thing I really recall was he put a toilet in the giant robot, and also there was a brazilian space pope or something who controlled the space elevator, and the space pirates were actually the good guys trying to throw off the corrupt Federation government.</br></br>  <br>Oh, it appears they did.</br>  <br> best mecha ever made <br>You watched season 2, right?</br></br>  <br>I had far more fun with all four of them than A/Z.</br>  <br>Yes bd soon.</br>  <br><br> Eureka seveN <br> Edgy </br></br></br>  <br>Each of those four were much better than aldnoah zero.</br>  <br>Fucking this. It's the complete opposite of edgy if nothing else.</br>  <br>I said it tried to be edgy, which is definitely true. Halfway through the show was 100% NOT about surfing, but instead muh despair.<br><br>Ending saved it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>At least Aldnoah had parts that had me interested. First episodes weren't terrible and the sort of 90's greenscreen mech design and Kubrick references were a nice touch.<br><br>VVV was just overall shit. It was "fun", but I don't see why Aldnoah wouldn't be "fun" in the exactly same way.<br><br>Neither are good but VVV is definitely worse.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Okay, now you're overdoing the hate. There is no way Space Vampires piloting robot mechas to fight over a space conspiracy was better than A/Z. The OP of Valvrave was awesome, but that was just about the only thing.</br></br></br>  <br> Vandread <br>I cant believe someone else knows it existed I loved that series<br><br>Athrun never cucked kira and put the blame for the destiny plan and the messiah on Shinn though</br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't see why Aldnoah wouldn't be "fun" in the exactly same way. <br>Aldnoah was ugly. Really ugly. The CG was ugly and it didn't blend in well with the ugly backgrounds at all. On top of all this, there was almost no discernable "fun factor" usually present in mecha anime. It didn't have Patlabor's charm. It didn't have Ishikawa/Nagai's "fuck you I'm edgy and I'm proud!" It didn't even get Code Geass' bizarre polical conspiracy right.<br><br>Aldnoah.Zero has nothing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>First two episodes of aldnoah shit was good becuase of the martians winning with their technology. After that the series just turn to complete shit with Inaho coming to the rescue every single time and making everyone around him look dumb. It was the same repetitive shit over and over again. <br>VVV wasn't that repetitive and the series had way more interesting character unlike aldnoah zero especially with the earth cast. Also characters actually died in valvrave while nobody died in aldnoah zero. Vlavrave had it's problems but it was a much better series than aldnoah zero.</br></br>  <br>I enjoyed the hell out of Valvrave. Aldnoah got dull around the time the Martian of the Week episodes began, and I never really got back into it. I repeatedly fell behind and had to force myself to catch up more than once.<br><br>So yes, I'd genuinely put Valvrave over A/Z. Both were poorly written, but at least Valvrave was fun to watch.</br></br></br>  <br>Name one element of aldnoah zero besides the ost that was better than Valvrave. Characters?Plot? Development? Anything.</br>  <br>Come on the final ark isn't edgy the whole show was based on using old mecha homages<br>Arc 1 young boy goes on adventure<br>Arc 2 he realizes that people are dying/this is war<br>Arc 3 despair and suffering<br>Arc 4 overcome problems and unlock the mecha's final super modo so he can save the world<br><br>Eureka seven was just following standard procedure. I bet that 90% of mecha shows in this thread follow this procedure</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Aldnoah was ugly <br>You're right, but I don't think being ugly has nothing to do with being unfunny.<br><br>And no one was comparing it with Patlabor or anything "decent". It was being compared with VVV, which is on the same level of shitness.<br><br><br>I can't really see why anyone would claim this. Everything you stated about VVV was bad and at least as bad as Aldnoah. I also don't believe "characters dying" is any measurable factor of greatness.<br><br>Both Aldnoah and VVV were trainwrecks that were "fun". Aldnoah really dropped the ball with Inaho reaching Mahouka-Jesus levels and other shit, but at least it made an effort. There were parts that I didn't find completely terrible. First episodes were really not that bad and the ending of first season was so out there I really enjoyed it. VVV was just shit episode after episode. It didn't even try. Only scene I even found remotely "fun" was when the teacher become Moses and split the ocean of students. And that's a lot said, as I pretty much remember only a one unrelevant scene from entire series.<br><br>I'm not saying Aldnoah was good or that I'm a fanboy, but c'mon. At least it had decent ost and mech design was often spot on with the technology gap. Before it went full cyber-eye there were things I didn't find outright horrible.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Come on the final ark isn't edgy  <br>That's what I said, numbnuts<br><br>Also<br> conceptually deleting space itself, graphically destroying whatever was partially inside it <br> not edgy <br> giving hubby-chan a kissu so he can asplode <br> not edgy <br> beating children <br> not edgy <br> And don't give me that "Holland was just Brightslapping Renton!" garbage either </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>uhm, I think you're embellishing in your memory, but Valvrave had just about the most boring, clichéd cast ever. To wit, we had<br> hot-headed idiot MC (aka Suzaku without PTSD) <br> the Shirley <br> black-haired aloof bitch who tries desperately to be Kallen <br> idiot delinquent who totally steals the MCs hot-headed shtick <br> hikkikomori bitch <br> utterly forgettable douche-canoe <br> ERUERUFU (aka white-haired Lelouch, complete with his own over-idolized Nunnally) <br>aaand a bunch of utterly forgettable bad guys, except for that psycho kid voiced by Yuuki Kaji whom I still want to run through a meat grinder despite being voices by one of my favorite VAs and that "call me Moses" guy who I still periodically remember and chuckle at</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The model kit for the sleipnir is better than he valvraves<br><br>M3 was pretty good i'd give it an 8/10<br>It was a while since I had seen a yandere in mecha. Lastime I saw one was in Nadesico</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Pretty good <br>The show was really dumb and tried to achieve shock value by twists after twists. I now "edgy" is a buzzword but it's been a while since I watched anything with that dark palette about angsty teenagers. Antagonist had shittiest motive in a long time. 3D was ugly.<br><br>The sad thing is that in the first episodes it seemed like it really could go somewhere. But it never did. It was meaningless twist after meaningless twist with characters you really didn't care and couldn't connect with.<br><br>Only redeeming feature was that the first op was sort of catchy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Overall mech and environment design?</br>  <br> Rather, what's the BEST mecha from the last ten years? I don't watch mecha a lot but most of the modern mecha shows that I've seen are garbage, Frontier is the only one I really loved (and is not even completely mecha, it's more half mecha half idol anime). <br><br><br>Gundam 00 hands down</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's funny because after all of that the cast for valvrave was still better than aldnoah zero.</br>  <br>The "deletion of space" its just a unique weapon the enimies have I mean they are aliens after all. I thought it was a nice change from lasers everywhere. The only other time I've seen it in use was in Fafner.<br><br>And c'mon hollands beatdowns on Renton were definitely throwbacks to brightslapping bones did break off from sunrise afterall. Another reason was the fact that he was jealous he won Eureka<br><br>Now as for the child abuse I won't lie it was somewhat edgy but used in moderation to darken the tone of the show frome time to time</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay anon you hate VVV and you think aldnoah was better but as I said before vvv had much better characters and the plots for both shows were about the same. Also people find vvv way more fun because it wasn't the same repetitive shit with the gary stu main character coming to the rescue in almost every episode. That shit started from episode three to the finale. Also there was absolute zero character developments among characters except for slain. Go back to valvrave and you will see that each of those characters had their moments and developments.</br>  So it's come down to this huh? It's not enough to argue about how my fav anime is better than your fav. We've now got to argue for why one shit series is a bigger piece of shit than the other one.<br><br><br>Let me tell you why that's bullshit. After the first few episodes, I came to V3 expecting some ridiculous shit out of it; the sort of campy stuff you might get in a B movie. I wasn't expecting high plot, just ridiculous characters like Elf doing ridiculous shit in the vein of 80s/90s action stars. I got what I went into for.<br><br>Now AZ on the other hand? War drama? Nope. Regular romance/drama? Nope. Cool mecha fights? Almost, but eventually nope. The central conflict about Earth vs Mars? Nope. Music aside, I got nothing out of AZ. AZ was just a series of build ups that mounted to nothing. Just promises, no punch line.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gundam SEED</br>  <br>You misspelled gunbuster anon</br>  <br>But you were still able to remember defining character traits for the valvrave cast. Could you do the same for a/z if asked?</br>  <br>KEK, sure Gundam Seed is not the best Gundam but call it as worst when we have show like A/Z is completely wrong</br>  <br>hm... lesse<br> borderline autism MC who's got great aim and enough knowledge of physics that he should already have a degree <br> the shirley <br> the Euphemia who (somehow) doesn't die <br> the second MC who has to endure just about everything awful until he's crazier than a sack full of weasels <br> Snazzbaum, the sleazy smug bad guy who still had a likable motive <br> the most boring Heroes' best friend <br> a bunch of bad guys most of whom are killed off before they could become interesting <br> a surprisingly interesting Euphemia/Nunally crossover <br><br>Frankly, I watched this show because of Inaho, Slaine, Snazzbaum, Lemrina and Asseylum (and the awesome awesome music). I didn't like all the story decisions, but I actually found the fights to be well animated and with great music, pretty much just like Guilty Crown, except with a slightly more agreeable ending and less shitty story decisions along the way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gundam Seed Destiny is still better than A/Z tell me what Destiny did that is worse than A/Z</br>  <br>I'll give you the part about being repetitive, gary-stu rescue was overused. Other points not so much.<br><br>Plot for VVV was really shit. Aldnoah sort of stayed the same and was true to being shit, VVV tried to pile more and more shit to the pile until you really couldn't tell what sort of space-vampire-alien-conspiracy shit it was trying to be. And it really was one of those things that on paper sounds really fun, but it was never portrayed as ironic work and you couldn't even get chuckles out of vampire-rape as it was never played as comedy. Only thing that made the series "good" were the treads on /a/ and that really has nothing to do with the series itself.<br><br>As for the characters I feel the general problem was, which you pointed out, that they were never quite developed. There were some characters that could have been something if given spotlight, like ptsd-drunk or the martian girl, but never got anywhere. But hell, potential existed, whereas VVV cast was just very uninteresting. Only person that I ever felt could go somewhere was the eyepatch-antagonist as he was portrayed sort of mystically in the beginning, but the character development and spotlight that "every character got" turned out him being just some alien or something.<br><br><br>But I don't see that as a problem. Both works are bad, but at least you expected something from Aldnoah, which would mean that at some point, some time, you believed the series would have something. To me even that alone is a bigger merit than series being intentionally shit, and I don't know if VVV actually ever tried to be shit, as it never was quite the comedy /a/ made it to be.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Frankly, for a lot of the main cast I had to look at the TVTropes page. For A/Z, see<br> (though I still had to look up Lemrina's name)</br></br>  <br><br>Certain bits of the show (like when Renton went berserk at the mook and found out it is actually piloted when he sees the pilots remains) and the manga is pretty "edgy"</br></br>  <br> it will probably sell worse than even G-Reco <br>The last time i check the last volume of A/Z sells worse than even Cross Ange</br></br>  <br>I like it when Bones anime gets edgy. DtB and FMA did that really well, especially the latter; but I don't think E7 handled the edge nearly as well as either of those series. I think it would have been just as good if the violence weren't as overtly-graphic as it turned out being.</br>  <br>Now that I recall it did have that edgy factor to it. I never really noticed at the time but I still thought the ost was god and the animation was decent. While the cg was jarring at times I didn't find it too distracting. He story while it wasn't a masterpiece it was at least somehing mild and the two "twists" can be seen from a mile away if you've seen a couple of meha series</br>  <br>Valvrave still had the better cast anon. Inaho was a shitty gary stu with no character background. Nothing from his character. I can't beleive that you even liked asseylum. I honestly can't take you serious again after hearing that. <br>The only thing I'm getting from pro aldnoah anons are better music and mech designs which isn't saying much.</br></br>  <br> at least you expected something <br>No, I went into it by being cautious, expecting nothing in particular. I didn't expect much, maybe cool mecha fights at least.<br><br>It was in hindsight, i.e., after actually finishing it, that I can look at it and say that they wanted to achieve many things and did none. At all.<br><br> a bigger merit <br>No it isn't. It's the reverse. That is the absolute worst thing to do. It just made the whole thing a complete waste of time (barring the threads on /a/.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I could've forgave Aldnoah Zero if had stopped at the end of the first season and the war continued in a whole new direction in the second with a new MC and cast.<br><br>Or at least Inaho and Princess got together for fucking sakes.</br></br></br>  <br> the two "twists" can be seen from a mile away if you've seen a couple of meha series <br>That's one element which made it sort of bad, it was very cliche but still tried to pull the twists with shock-value alone.<br><br>Not that anon but I can't defend any character from VVV either. There was some aliens and eruerufu did some plans no one understood. Problem in Aldnoah was that many characters were never really developed but even by existing they made the series far better than VVWild ride.<br><br>Aldnoah get's the "at least you tried" medal, while VVV is the strange guy who rolls around in puddle because he realizes he will never amount to anything. Trying is more positive than being just shit.<br><br>In the image you can see the moment where the main cast sort of realizes their own show is shit and stop trying.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Let's say it this way:<br>After they tried to scare the viewers with Asseylum's death the fifth time, I started getting attached to her like "come on, you've bullshited us with this so many times, you're not actually gonna do it, right? Right?" and I sort of liked how ignorant of the world she was. After the series is over, the best I can say about her is how she took a huge stinking shit on convention and ended the whole clusterfuck in a political marriage, thereby ending a conflict surprisingly neatly and putting a giant gravestone on a thousand shipping debates.<br><br>My favorite character was still Snazzbaum and I'm still pissed at Slaine for murdering him, though.</br></br></br></br>  <br> at some point, some time, you believed the series would have something. To me even that alone is a bigger merit <br>What kind of shitty logic is that? Having 'believe' in it is irrelevant to the show's actual quality. You're on fucking /a/, where people jump to conclusions about shows that haven't aired and we're neighbours with /m/, which is already shitting on the new Gundam show based on trailers and staff announced.</br></br>  <br>i was really mad that Chaika got a shitty budget in comparison. The characters and the fights there still ended up being enjoyable, but I know they could have done so much better.</br>  <br>If nothing else, it means the series had a beginning that left you wanting more.</br>  http://strawpoll.me/5038527  <br> Aldnoah get's the "at least you tried" medal <br>Are you American? Because that medal is worth nothing.<br><br> he realizes he will never amount to anything.  <br>Yeah, nope. V3 had better mecha battles than AZ. Not mounting to anything describes AZ more than V3.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Princess <br> Wanting that Sora 2.0 piece of shit to be happy </br></br>  <br>/m/ has be pretty chill about g-tekketsu they loved the designs so far and like how it gives of an "after war gundam X" vibe. I'm pretty excited myself the director is at least competent enough to give us a 7/10 series at least</br>  <br>tengen toppa gurren lagann</br>  Evangelion, it's shit  <br> had a beginning that left you wanting more <br>So Valvrape then. A body jacking space vampire sounds way more promising than the plot of what sounds like another cheap attempt at imitating Gundam.</br></br>  Name a good mecha show in the last 30 years<br><br>Protip:  you can't  </br></br>  <br> Had better mecha battles <br>I don't remember any of them. They were in space at some point I guess. It was just unmemorable shit with ugly mech design. And what was the thing with harakiri-super attack? You couldn't come up with anything more ridiculous?<br><br>Really? I guess it's your opinion and all, but body-jacking vampires pretty much sums up what was wrong with the series. It's just stupid and tries to rake in the retardation-points.</br></br></br></br>  <br> by existing they made the series far better than VVWild ride <br>Just to make you think like that because the potential it promised but it never happened which is why it is bad writing</br></br>  <br> Lol it's now edgy to shit on what a lot consider the best ever <br>the post<br><br><br> I'm a newfag who still thinks mocking eva makes me look cool <br> I'm a newfag who hasn't realized that people only hate Shinji ironically now <br>the post<br><br><br> First episode ends with New Orleans nuked from orbit <br>Say against that show what you want, but THAT actually looked like it had potential<br><br>Though, to be fair, Valvrave's beginning also looked promising, until the writers forgot about the Vampire thing for six episodes and then thought, "shit, our characters have done fuck all vampity lately, so let's throw in some LEL EDGY RAPE SCENE"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gundam</br>  <br>But if you have a character you want to see developed and shone light into means you are interested in the said character. Which is automatically more than I can say about any of VVV characters.</br>  <br>Yeah I see what you mean there but I feel the reason most people bring that up is due to the shows artstyle. Eureka seven's genki yoshida designs do set you in that happy mood so when the darker parts of the show occur it can be unsettling (like the scene with renton going crazy with after killing those pilots)<br><br><br>Yeah I've been meaning to get to the manga. From what I heard it's the victory gundam of the eureka seven franchise</br></br></br></br>  <br>Came out 35 years ago</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128645315 <br>Yes?</br>  <br> But if you have a character you want to see developed and shone light into means you are interested in the said characters <br>It is everyshow ever</br></br>  <br> It's still not as bad as Gundam Seed Destiny though <br>Nah, GSD actually makes sense, everyone is that show is a fucking idiot. Nothing in A/Z makes sense hell not even the title makes sense since it was suppose to be about Slaine apparently reaching "zero"</br></br>  <br>Except Valvrave</br>  <br>So what does that make you think that better than VVV characters</br>  <br> I didn't have a problem with Aldnoah Zero and I loved the ending because it was (kind of) out of nowhere <br>Jesus fuck this shit taste</br></br>  I give VVV the credit it's due, at least it accomplished what it set out to do with revealing the truth of the world. A/Z had no point and felt like a huge waste of time.  <br>The franchise still continue and watching all of them are good</br>  At least VVV had god-tier cast and OPs unlike Aldnoahshit.    <br>You have to admit the decision to kill (even though the second season ruined that) seemed kinda ballsy. It really made the finale go from "meh" to interesting.</br>  <br>Not everything has to be musashi Gundoh to be shit. It was extremely uninspired fights for the robot CGI and the animation for characters was passable but nothing to write home about. Further, the direction of the animation is part of the animation and when you have scenes like anti-anti-tank missile loli jeep you can probably call it shit,</br>  <br>Valvrave is the easy answer, it is literally the physical incarnation of all hopelessness focused entirely on twists and shock value that becomes outdated after the firs viewing. It is a textbook example of everything that could go wrong without the concept being a factor and everything wrong with the mecha genre ever since Code Geass was successful in omni-pandering and Haruhi Suzumiya and K-ON sentenced the industry into the current fad of slice of life shows being the "in" hip thing.</br>  <br>Not really because it was fucking obvious that it was meant to grab idiots to watch the second season, anyone who was smart enough knew what they were doing.</br>  <br>actually I had a giant nerd-gasm when I saw Inaho stepping out of the car at the start of S2.</br>  <br><br><br>This is what happens when idiots watch G-Reco</br></br></br>  <br>VVV ended with witch mobs that killed thouusands and liberated no one.<br>Aldnoah was at least entertaining.</br></br>  <br>You are everything that's wrong with anime fandom</br>  <br>because the eye</br>  <br><br> This is why "Stick to A/Z faggot" became a thing in /m/ due to some of the people there got sick and tired of others begging to be spoonfed </br></br>  <br>but it wasn't the Code Geass I was craving for</br>  <br>The ending where the main girl gets taken over by the supercomputer and starts behaving like a slut goddess is pretty good. Sure the fight animation for the ending was pretty good, but it was a dull fight. All I cared about was how how hana was evil.<br><br>Delicious evil brown.</br></br></br>  <br>Worst piece of shit I have ever completed.<br>I felt like I wasted my time in nothing when I finished, all the characters were shit. <br>Marito did nothing.<br>The other 2 girls that I can't remeber what their names are were useless.<br>Slaine was a fucking retard.<br>Inaho was a damn robot.<br><br>I can't believe people liked this garbage.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>VVV also didn't introduce a new character 2 episodes before its finale to tie up its loose ends. <br><br>The very existence of Crutons Jr. is easily the worse writing in any mecha this decade.</br></br></br>  How come everybody hates CGI?  <br>Well it worked. We got less people complaining about G-Reco</br>  <br>People who aren't idiots don't. It's badly done CGI that's hated on.<br><br>Akito OVA's CGI wasn't being hated on since it was actually done well.</br></br></br>  <br>Valvrave is definitely worse.</br>  <br>Everybody hates CHEAP CGI. Looks fine when it has effort put into it.</br>  <br> now that I recall <br>Early on the mahvess seemed to be powered by the pain and suffering of angsty teens. I thought the edginess was pretty on-the-nose.<br><br>I think that the underlying concept of communication was pretty good. It certainly wasn't executed very well, and there were some plot points I wish they could have gone even edgier in (MC with his brothers fiancee sexual tension?)<br>maybe 6/10 (slightly better than average) but could have been better if it was just presented in a more exciting and less trite manner.</br></br></br></br></br>  Valvrave is legitimately the single worst mecha anime ever and that is in no way a meme and an exaggeration.  <br>Because it generally looks bad? Especially among mecha fans because, as on of anime's oldest genres, it had it's golden age in a time when CGI didn't exist..<br><br>Full CGI like sidonia S1 looks okay, MJP is probably the best example in recent mecha to pull it off well. AZ's bad CGI is just another tick mark on its long list of faults.</br></br></br>  <br> MJP is probably the best example in recent mecha to pull it off well <br>Fafner EXODUS's CGI has also been fantastic so far.</br></br>    AZ threads were filled with fujoshits from tumblr. Therefore it's the worst.  <br>I liked the progression of the second season a lot more. Sure, it was shit, but with all of the new orbital knights and the ocassional slaine HAPPENING moment, it was a lot more entertaining than most of the first season. If they had actually pulled something closer to code geass, I'm sure most of us would feel it was more entertaining, but certain things really brought it eg princess drama.<br><br><br>Haruto acting violent was foreshadowed for a few episodes in advance. No one was surprised that he might attack someone during airing. What was surprising was the accompanying rape.</br></br></br></br>   A/Z <br> Valvrave <br> G-Reco <br>Mecha is pretty much dead, Fafner is just desperate life support</br></br></br>  <br>No, it's vvv that is the worst. In comparison to A/Z it has worse cast, worse characters, worse plot, worse writing, worse action, worse cgi, worse music, and overall unenjoyable unlike A/Z which was moderately enjoyable.</br>  <br>Valvrave is the worst. <br>Aldnoah.Zero does undoubtedly want you to take it seriously. You can really tell it's trying to be an epic space adventure, filled with interesting politics and awesome characters, but... it just isn't. It's not like, say Valvrave, that pretty much just insulted your intelligence and credibility as an anime fan by just watching it; Aldnoah.Zero legitimately wants you to be pulled into this world, to care about these characters, and to really be on the edge of your seat as events play out.</br></br>  <br>GOING GOING HIKARI E</br>  <br> Haruto acting violent was foreshadowed for a few episodes in advance. No one was surprised that he might attack someone during airing. What was surprising was the accompanying rape. <br>At episode 2, tgat is not foreshadowing. Then nothing with the vampires is done, so yes they did forget it, then suddenly rape.</br></br>  <br> one tries to be serious but fails <br> ultimately insults your intelligence by putting up pretenses of intelligence (rayleigh scattering etc.) <br> one tries to be goofy with silly plot twists <br> on-the-nose writing, but you know what you're getting into <br><br>I don't know how you can argue on those grounds. Valvrave failed in a lot of ways, but it managed to entertain in the ways it wanted to. Yes it is stupid, but its hard to argue that a show that was trying to be intelligent and ended up being just as dumb is somehow superior. Maybe less disingenuous, but that's like arguing a statement made ironically is equally uninformed as the same statement made in earnest.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  At least the first cour of VVV was fun to watch. A/Z was just awful. It's like the writers improvise all the time. At the end of A/Z's first cour they make think there's something between Inaho and the princess, but then they only have scene together in the second cour and he possessed by his bionic eye. I don't know why they even bothered.  <br>Valvrave is the worst when all is said and done. Valvrave is a complete failure, a failure to provide good characters, memorable scenes, or even to entertain. Why does Valvrave fail at being dumb fun? And why should you not watch Valvrave as opposed to an anime very much like it, or an anime whose sole purpose is to provide easy brain candy. After looking at the lack-luster characters, the stupid plot-twists and all that other wonderful bullshit. For all its eccentricities, Valvrave is a show that's missing a lot of soul. When you watch a show that tries to achieve that same feeling that Valvrave attempts, I at least feel, it's a show born because the creators wanted the audience to have a little fun. Valvrave feels like it's engineered for the sole purpose of keeping the audience around long enough so they feel obligated to buy merchandise, and all the craziness that it contains: those stupid plot-twists and ludicrous situations, are born from that. And yes, you could argue that's the purpose of every anime that's ever existed, but still, you're not supposed to be so obvious about it. Valvrave is an empty fireworks show; an hollow mess that's devoid of passion, creativity and soul, that feels like its very blue-prints was built to pander to the biggest demographic possible. Valvrave is the worst mecha-anime. Not self-aware. Not "so-bad-it's-good". Not clever in any way. It's the inevitable result of putting together as many typical tropes of the mecha genre as possible, mashing them together, and hoping that it will be eaten up by the masses. So yes, just... plain... bad.</br>  <br>Bodyswap hijinx? I'm pretty sure that occurred before the rape. And though it's been a while, I recall haruto lashing out in the episode previous.</br>  <br>No you are rememberingwrong Aldnoah was fun and vvv was just shit.</br>  <br>in stillframes, sidonia-type cgi looks okay<br><br>during any movement whatsoever, it's fucking shit-tier eye cancer of the worst goddamned kind<br><br>who the actual fuck thought it was okay to render that shit at 12 fucking frames per goddamned fucking second?<br><br>jesus christ</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was the other way around. <br>VAMPIRES IN SPACE &gt; Autistic kiddo defeating every enemy without breaking a sweat</br></br>  <br> Bodyswap hijinx? <br>Never actually happened. People wanted to see them but there were none.</br></br>  <br>is this pasta? I agree valvrave was meh and stopped watching it after like 4 episodes, but holy shit that wall.</br>  <br>Except both of them wanted to be serious and be taken seriously. It's just that Aldnoah actually tried while vvv did not.</br>  <br>g-reco was fucking awful<br><br>schizophrenic pacing, endless numbers of one-dimensional characters (often introduced and then discarded one or two episodes apart), a confusing (admittedly less so after additional research after the show finished airing) story that couldn't decide what it wanted to do, and varying animation quality does not a good or even acceptable anime make<br><br>much less one falling under the gundam banner<br><br>it was a fucking catastrophe, and you know it<br><br>the ONLY acceptable parts of it were the good fight sequences</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you really arguing that A/Z was any better? Obvious female gaze pandering, lazy writing, lazy setpieces, the bare minimum effort to make the MC look OH-SO-COOL compared to other characters, and just as many idiotic plot twists as valvrave also designed to simply rope in the audience each week.<br><br>When you consider that valvrave was SUNRISE and like gundam EXISTS TO SELL MERCH (no one has any illusions about gundam so why have 'em about valvrave) it's hard to feel betrayed. A/Z may have started with a soul, but the writers just started doing things near the end because whatever. It's just as messy and nonsensical.</br></br></br>  <br>So autistic retard losing with a giant robot and needed a white haired Russian gary stu, who can't pilot, save him is more entertaining than a standard robot fight with interesting tactics?</br>  Aldnoah failed because they did everything they can to not be Gundam. It needed to be Gundam Seed for it to even click locally. They avoid that and then it flopped. Had Aldnoah done a more grounded approach to SEED's storyline, it would've actually taken off as a franchise  <br> what's the worst mecha ever made and why is it it aldnoah.zero? <br> what is NGE </br></br>  <br><br>It is actually, and it is basically spammed by the same autist in /m/ (with different variants) because VVV raped him or something</br></br>  <br>No, I sat through the drek that is Valvrave and at no point found anything worthwhile or of value in it.</br>  Oh, I see G-Reco's finally getting mentioned as well. Time to bring in Cross Ange so we can get the full party going.<br><br> lesbians, lesbian rape, mind rape and tons of women and children getting killed is fine <br> nipples is still no no even in BDs. <br>CA is indeed the worst.</br></br></br></br>  <br> A/Z <br> Valvrave <br> G-Reco <br>One of the these things is not like the other<br><br>One of these things just doesn't belong.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure why you bother responding, when all you'll get is some "you didn't like if because you're an idiot who didn't understand it" strawman.</br>  <br>Infinite Stratos 2 counts as a mecha show, right?</br>  <br>Here's your reply</br>  <br>Best example of them trying to not be SEED is personified with Asseylum. They tried hard to not draw the obvious comparison to Lacus Clyne or heck, even Releena Darlian, as a result, her characterization suffered immensely</br>   VVV  <br>So bad it was fun to watch<br> Aldnoah <br>The same but you knew there was good intent but it was completely mishandled<br> Reco G <br>Just completely bland so it became uninteresting I couldn't tell if it was good or bad<br> CA <br>Just stupid fun</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> VVV  <br> So bad it was fun to watch <br>Sorry meant to say so bad that it's bad and not fun at all.</br></br></br>  1. Code Geass<br>2. Full metal panic<br>3. Dunno haven't watched any other mecha anime</br></br>  <br>what is entertaining of standard robot fight with tactics from gary tsu MC? are you 12 years old?</br>  <br>No it's an accurate analysis of why vvv is so awful.</br>    <br>More entertaining than a robot overheating and freezing up every five minutes.</br>  <br> of course asspull is more interesting </br>  <br>Asspulls is literally all vvv is.</br>  <br>First season is pretty good if that helps</br>  <br>Gundress. Hands down.</br>  <br>Probably the faggot reviewer who is getting his opinion from /a/ and sharing it on youtueb</br>  <br> implying all of A/Z is not asspull more </br>  Whats wrong with AGE? I know its not great but I cant quite put my finger on where it sucks  <br>It isn't. If you think tgat then you obviously didn't watch it.</br>  <br>best post in the thread<br>not to mention that some of the best mecha designs is in 00, audio/ music is god tier too(duh), Kawaii is just GOAT)</br></br>  <br>this Exodus had godly cgi. you can always count on xebec to do good cgi I would even go as far as to say I prefer it to he originals animation</br>  <br>The MC itself is an asspull, how can you still defend that?</br>  <br> Evangelion <br> Mecha <br>Pick one, shitlord.</br></br></br>  <br>fuck off /m/oron</br>  <br>if those are your complaints you haven't watched enough mecha. In the mecha genre rape and child abuse of all kind go hand in hand</br>  <br>So is Sue-Elf from vvv and that shit also comes with the most inconpetent useless Shinji ripoff that is even worse. How can you defend that?</br>  <br>NGE isn't about the mecha. It's about the characters, m8.</br>  <br>Not my fault you suck at reading comprehension.</br>  <br> implying a/z wasn't an asspull <br> inaho didn't get shot in the head it was his eye and now we have technology to give him a new eye that will cause him to surpass kira yamato but it's only for inaho and NO other soldier would get this upgrade even though a squad of them would win the war. BUT WAIT if he uses it too long he'll die. <br> lol jk we took it out of him </br></br></br>  <br>people didn't like the final arc because it became seed/destiny again where the mc was too afraid to pull the trigger and just became a mecha butcher</br>  <br>Gunbuster<br>Diebuster<br>Evangelion<br>TTGL<br>Mostly Gainax stuff. There's probably something else I'm forgetting that isn't Gainax.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The inconpetent was helped by the competent one who was trained child soldiers for 8 years, that's make sense</br>  <br>wb NGE</br>  <br>And they were still more boring and infuriating than Inaho who was at least entertaining.</br>  <br>It liberated the world from the Magius and accomplished the goal of exposing the truth. Honestly A/Z bored me, the fights were too predictable. If the mecha action isn't fun then I'm out.</br>  <br>The sad part is it didn't have to be that way, they could have easily introduced him earlier and not made him feel like an afterthought. It really feels like he was thought up last minute because they didn't have the guts to follow through on anything. Really the show should have just been 12 episodes, the "plot" didn't warrant 24.</br>  Well, since we seem to be /m/ today: What did y'all think of Linebarrels of Iron and/or Overman King Gainer? Based on the overviews, they look to be at least fun.  <br>You're trolling right?</br>  <br>Well there's also Mari Okada's Aquarion Evol, M3 and the new Gundam she's going to ruin with her shit writing as well.</br>  <br>It didn't liberate people. It took away freedom and turned into a red scare situation with witch mobs and people selling each other out.</br>  <br>I know right, what a great ending.</br>  <br>You didn't like EVOL's deep symbolism?</br>  <br> MC literally IM SO COOL bait with asspull <br> It is more entertaining <br>You just prove you are 12 years old</br></br></br>   defending aldnoah unironically itt <br>ay</br>  <br>I don't speak the language of the cur. It all sounds like barks to me.</br>  VVV first season was only fun if you were in the threads when it was airing and the second season is legitimately the worst mecha related thing possible, especially the ending.  <br>L-Elf was overpowered but he wasn't a one noted Mary Sue. Cain beat his ass in first season and he failed to protect the one he wanted to protect, also he lost his best friend and had an actual emotional range unlike Inaho who was a boring flat character without a personality who was a plot device without carrying the show.<br><br>Unlike Inaho, L-Elf wasn't well liked or accepted by the Module until he proved himself. Inaho never fucking struggled for anything.</br></br></br>  <br> Inaho who was at least entertaining <br><br>Inaho's so irrelevant in his own show that Aniplex shuns him in Wonfes.</br></br></br>  <br> boring flat character without a personality who was a plot device without carrying the show <br>You literally just described L-Elf. <br><br>And Inaho struggled with his personal issues in the second season.</br></br></br></br>  <br>that cannon probably raised the price by 2000 yen</br>  <br>The first season was the same boring shit as the second one. There is no difference between them quality wise. They are both the worst.</br>  <br>In the end she really didn't have much characterization to speak of, she was very much a parrot spouting things others had said. They really had no idea of what to do with her, so they put her in a coma for a good chunk of the show.</br>  <br>Slaine's getting another figure too, I find it ridiculous how Inaho has been ignored. They're not even hiding their favoritism now.</br>  <br> another <br>That's the same one that was announced before, the only difference is that it's colored. Inaho is getting one of that maker too.</br></br>  <br> And Inaho struggled with his personal issues in the second season. <br><br>No, he didn't. He was a monotonous plot device now with forced homolust in second season.<br><br>L-Elf carried VVV easily. He struggled, committed mistakes and got an actual character arc.<br><br>Inaho's entire arc was dropped so he could become Slaine's therapist. He was such a shitty character nobody cared about him besides what he would do for Slaine.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And Inaho struggled with his personal issues in the second season. <br><br>His eye? That amounted to nothing and was handwaved? They made it sound like it was too late and that it would kill him, turns out he could remove it and suffered no repercussions.</br></br></br>  <br>This is bad. Why couldn't Aniplex add an Inaho little stick too? It seems mean spirited.</br>  <br> L-Elf carried VVV easily. He struggled, committed mistakes and got an actual character arc. </br>  <br>How is that wrong you retard, did you even watch the show?</br>  <br>I think so too. Adding something that tiny and ridiculous to one but not the other makes it look like they only want to troll whoever buys the other one. Not that I care since I won't buy either but it's kind of a dick move since they'll probably cost the same. Actually I bet Sleipnir will be even more expensive.</br>  <br>Hey newfag, that guy is a regular troll in every mecha thread. He greenquotes you with an epic maymay picture to start shit and then watches quietly as you all fall for his bait and reply to each other thinking it's him. Ignore his posts and lurk the fuck more.</br>  <br>They seem to love to ignore him, I think they viewed Sleipnir as the face of the show more than they ever did Inaho. He never even got a solo spread, it's pathetic.</br>  <br>Really, who wouldn't want a teeny tiny Inaho to go along with Sleipnir? Unless they fucked up and Sleipnir isn't to scale with Tharsis.</br>  <br>Yes I did and he is easily the secobd worst character in the show. His plan always work, he takes on giant robots without one of his own and wins, has no trouble durung the show at all, as lways gets what he wants.</br>  <br>It is. You can see it in here  that's the correct scale, Tharsis is 17m and Sleipnir is 13,5m. I'm thinking they might add it later since Tharsis didn't come with that tiny Slaine initially, but if they don't, then that's a dick move. I wouldn't be surprised after what happened with the magazine spreads, though. They were never discreet about their bias.</br>  <br>How they've treated Inaho just feels weird, I know Aniplex only cares about money but usually it's not this obvious.</br>  <br>I'll never understand why they keep pushing Inaho as a main character in interviews and focus so much on UFE and Inaho and then pretend he doesn't exist outside of that. Maybe they're just that bad reading their audience. For example when Inaho got shot in S1 they were legit surprised at how many fans were worried about him and how little cared about Hime dying again. It looks like they underestimated their own character and thought no one would care about Inaho because Slaine was in the show. Incidentally they overestimated Hime and don't know how to deal with the hate she got so they ignore or avoid any questions about her that are politically incorrect. This is amazing in it's own way, they're clinically delusional.</br>  <br><br>Aniplex is no stranger to hyping shit up but that series took the cake.</br></br>  <br><br> Hurr hurr hurr I'm a retard on /a/. I'm going to "implying" that you said something stupid but I'm not going to take it any further than that because I'm a retard on /a/. <br><br>Seriously why do people do this shit, like you literally aren't even saying anything, you've done absolutely nothing to counter his point whatsoever.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a retard from /m/ actually.</br>  <br><br>It really does feel like he practically Alan Smitheed himself off of the project. I haven't seen him mention it once on twitter and he actually seemed to get agitated when people brought it up to him at a con as if it was supposed to be on the screened questions list but it managed to get by and he was forced to talk about it. He even still mentions and talks about Gargantia on occassion and he wrote even less scripts for that one.</br></br>  <br><br>It's in the latest SRW game so obviously not. Honestly the show was alright up until the last quarter or so where the 3rd generation MC and antagonists motivations and actions stopped really making any sort of logical sense even within the context of the course of events.</br></br>  <br><br>It seemed like they basically just copied ideas from the latest Gundam series that were coming out at the time like AGE and Unicorn. They really seemed to specifically want it to be their own version of Unicorn with the disc and merchandise sales to go with it. They even got the same composer to try to do the music even if he captured none of what made his work on Unicorn so strong.<br><br>The thing with Unicorn is though that it's capitalizing on over 3 decades worth of continuity, themes and canon within a franchise while Aldnoah was supposed to be a starter series, yet they seemed to have the expectation that if they got that specific assortment of people that it'd all work out.</br></br></br></br>  So can we all agree this is the worst, most blatant wish-fulfillment mary sue fantasy to ever come out of Japan?  second worst <br><br>Afrieta kinda beat it in that department</br></br>  <br>It is pretty blatant wish-fulfillment Mary Sue fantasy, to be sure. I've still been kind of enjoying it.</br>  <br>That's not Mushoku Tensei nor onii-sama.</br>  <br>kinda stopped caring about it after he became an Ogre.<br><br>before he at least had to be a little strategic since he was physically weaker than a lot of his prey, But now he just curb-stomps them and returns to his orgy.</br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty fucking bad. What's mostly hilarious though is that you can clearly tell that in the beginning of the story, the author fully intended the protagonist to be a perfect Mary Sue that is completely morally unambiguous despite doing really kind of evil shit and only later does the author go, "Oh no, I totally meant that all along." after presumably commenters went, "Man, this dude does some fucked up shit."</br>  <br>Rudi isn't a mary sue at all.</br>  <br>ok</br>  Yeah it becomes really mastubatory after he starts having orgies with the harem. Kumo desu ga, Nani Ka? is the same premise but a better story because the MC barely evades death and is weak compared to most enemies so there's actual tension.  <br>Don't know why you posted just to say ok, but as long as you agree.<br><br>Onii-sama is a mary sue though though I still think trap mech onii-sama is worse.</br></br></br>  <br>I've been entertained by him curb-stomping his enemies so far, but it will grow old soon if things stay that way. I think I would enjoy the concept of someone who gains power by eating his enemies if that was a common trait in the setting, if people in general evolved by killing and feeding. It could lead to interesting interpersonal and societal dynamics, especially if it wasn't quite as edgy as it could be.</br>  Gun ota  <br>Didn't that guy that has shit magic technique and get his shit stolen and made into a slave?<br>Gun-ota is pretty bad but he's pretty balanced compared to most OPMCs.<br><br>World Teacher on the other hand.</br></br></br></br>  Are any of these things translated by actual people and not alien robots crudely pretending they understand the English language?  <br>The author wanted a vampire Loli, so they stripped his ass of everything than gave him two fucking countries because dragon inventor and pounding vampire Loli pussy.</br>  <br> World Teacher <br>Pure fucking shit. Bu ni mi is more interesting.</br></br>  <br>just assume the latter<br><br>I think only three people actually translate these things.</br></br></br>  <br> perfect Mary Sue that is completely morally unambiguous despite doing really kind of evil shit <br><br>Yeah this is the worst fucking bit, rape is looked down upon so the perfect Mary sue MC couldn't possibly allow it so he feeds drugs to the elf prisoners and tell his goblins that they need 'consent' to fuck them as a way to go around rape even though it's the same fucking thing. <br><br>I'd be better if he straight up allowed his goblins to what they wished with the elves rather than being a sanctimonious fucker about it.</br></br></br></br></br>  Hope the series ends the way it began.<br><br>With Mi just catching him off guard and killing him out of a fit of jealousy with a lightning-magic imbued dagger.</br></br>  <br>Now she can easily bukkake human forts though(she literally says bukkake)</br>  <br>Mushoku tensei makes me cringe</br>  <br>Good let it flow through you</br>  <br>really? why?</br>  <br>But this time he dies for real, forever.<br><br>Priceless.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know I kinda want another reincarnation<br><br>and endless recursion of being OP as all hell only to be stabbed to death by a yandere.</br></br></br>   mc is a loser who dies and is reborn in another world as a gary stu <br>I drop everything that begins like that</br>  <br>No, no. This one begins with MC is a Gary Stu who dies and is reborn in another world as a Gary Stu.</br>  <br>usually reincarnation series about gary stus are "MC is a gary stu that dies and is reborn in another world as a gary stu"<br><br>Like Re:monster</br></br></br>    WOW LOOK AT THE ORIGINAL FANTASY I CREATED <br>  AND LOOK AT THIS IT WORK EXACTLY LIKE A VIDEO GAME. <br><br>There is literally no LN, manga, anime or crude drawing on a napkin that can make an entertaining story using this, it's a redflag and only underage fags think it's good.</br></br></br>  <br>Its just self-insert wish fulfillment bullshit man</br>  <br>When did he have an orgy with his harem? Did a new chapter drop?</br>  I'm enjoying that slime reincarnated manga  <br>The ones with the mc being a loser before are even worse</br>  <br>Yeah but it's done right. There's actual characterization, conflicts, plot, and drama and the MC is powerful but not completely broken (dragon god is though).<br><br>Can't really say that for most series in its genre.</br></br></br>  <br>with the loser one there's at least some "issues" the Mc has to deal with.<br><br>with the gary stu one it's gary stu A becomes gary stu B.</br></br></br>  <br>It's even worse when there are no actual explicit bullshit video game mechanics but everything still inexplicably works like an RPG with idiotic spells and items and shit.<br><br>Also, adventurer's guild that works with ranking system, every single fucking one.<br><br>I don't understand. Even in the worst of manga, this kind of shit is pretty uncommon, they at least try to pretend they have a world that isn't based on RPG mechanics. Yet every other one of these does this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll still reading this. I'm waiting the growth of his child, maybe it would get better.<br><br><br>But anon, Mushoku Tensei is good. Can't say its excelent but it is above average.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, have to admit that a ranking system for an adventurer guild makes sense. I mean, if I was in charge of what's basically a medieval staffing agency I wouldn't give some new guy my most difficult jobs until I knew he could handle it.</br>  <br>What's it about and what happens in it to make it live up to that claim?</br>  <br>No, the worst one is the fantasy Gary Stu story who is reincarnation of 2 Gary Stu with different power which make him the Gary Stu-est.<br> World Break </br></br>  <br>Nah. There's a lot to like, mostly world building. that actually has some thought put into it (but not too much that it reaches back into stupid territory). I've seen way worse self-insert garbage than this.</br>   Good idea  <br> intelligent MC <br>BUTT<br> no challenges <br> power scaling doesn't make sense <br>thank wish-fulfillment for making yet another potential story garbage</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>second post pretty much nails it off the bat. <br><br>Re:Monster is without a doubt, wish fulfillment from start to finish. Even when Rou loses his arm he is quickly provided with a artifact to replace it before it becomes a inconvenience.<br><br>Still, it's not nearly as blatant as Arifureta. Arifureta is only ever amusing when you imagine it being self aware of the main character being this huge chuuni edge lord with white hair, guns in a fantasy setting and a dark black coat. It's so bad you can sort of derive amusement from just how blatant it is.<br><br>Honestly the thing that gets me the most about Arifureta is watching the author use characters as a mouth piece to try and explain why Haijime is right. It gets very silly at moments, especially when it sets a strawman for those characters to make this point at.<br><br>If I was smart I would have dropped this a long time ago, but it's like a terrible habit I can't stop. Please help me Anon. I have a problem.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yeah but it's done right. <br>A story about a neet pedofile loser in a straight video game MMORPG copy paste world, that has ridiculous power while being a complete pussy.<br>The author is a NEET, and you clearly can't enjoy it unless you're a neet as well. It's shitty escapism, it's even worse than World Teacher.</br></br></br>  I actually would want to see his past life over this; a human hero who eats his foes to gain their powers sounds like a fun morality tale, unless the author manages to fuck it up.  <br>no where near as bad as arifureta when it comes to blatant wish fullfillment</br>  <br>Most of what you just said doesn't apply to the series (especially not the MMO part).</br>  <br>Keep telling yourself that.</br>  <br> MC dies and is reborn as weak-ass goblin <br> In a fantasy world with RPG mechanics that let him level up and class change into other monsters <br> But he's a super-duper special snowflake with a special ability to eat things and gain their power for himself <br> He quickly becomes the most powerful being existence, making everyone a slave/follower and fucking his harem of hot women whenever he wants <br> Most of the story is him streamrolling his inferior opponents </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> this is the worst, most blatant wish-fulfillment mary sue fantasy to ever come out of Japan? <br><br>No, it's not. <br>It's just one of the worst in "decently popular title that has been fan translated" <br><br>There are plenty of even shittier ones in web novel sites, you just don't know them because they're either obscure or haven't been translated.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you read it or just read the summery and went "nope"? (latter is understandable since the summery just doesn't do the series justice).</br>  <br>Mushoku Tensei may be wish-fulfillment, but it's the positively good type. <br>It's about regret and becoming better. It doesn't fulfill your power fantasies, it makes you wish you had a chance to make better choices and become a better person. <br>And no, it's not Mary Sue at all. <br><br>Not fair at all comparing it to this power masturbation.</br></br></br></br></br>  I personally enjoy this thing  <br>Become better, by fantasizing and having sex with underage girls. Great stuff.<br>Whatever differences Mushoku Tensei has with this are arbitrary. They're both shit, Mushoku just being the greater and more steaming pile of shit, meant for even more morally bankrupt people than Re:monster. Don't try to draw imaginary lines, you can't have both.</br></br>  <br>Not the same person but I read through most of the first volume and<br> A story about a neet pedofile loser in a straight video game MMORPG copy paste world <br>seems a pretty apt description. Though the stupid RPG-esque stuff is mostly just the lazy shit that a lot of Japanese fantasy stories do for some unfathomable reason, including manga and shit.<br><br>I don't really give a shit if it becomes good in Volume 4 or whatever either, not picking that up again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> muh moral </br>  <br>Have you actually read Mushoku Tensei?<br>I mean, the impression I get is that you don't. At all. <br>It's really more about growing up (despite having a 30+ year old memory), family, losing family, and regaining family. <br><br>It's not at all a easy going harem fantasy you seem to imagine. I really don't believe you read the book AT ALL.</br></br></br></br></br>  Will Yorai-kun continue translating ``I Kinda Came To Another World, But Where’s The Way Home´´?<br>Like it because the MC is pretty much Kumagawa.</br>  <br>I'm sorry, I don't give a shit about or can't relate to people that want to raise a harem of underaged girls. <br>Not really..</br></br>  What's wrong with wish fulfillment, it's fun  Started yesterday reading Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka?,<br>How can a ugly spider monster be so kawaii?.</br>  <br>yeah first volume is pretty standard for those types of series.<br><br>But whereas a lot of series show promise at first only to throw it out the window. First volume of MT seems generic only to get better and better 3rd volume onward.<br><br>MT in this thread is like having a thread all about "generic harems you hate" and someone putting the Tenchi on it. It's a harem, girls are after the MC's dick, and the MC doesn't exactly fuck them (at least not in the OVA), but putting it together with the likes of IS and Kampfer makes you think "this nigga is retarded."</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mushoku Tensei only gets worse though.</br>  <br>are you just trolling?</br>  <br>Wait what nigga<br><br>The only one that applies is that one sex Rudy had with Eris at the end of their journey. <br>All the other sex happened after Rudy got married when they were grown up<br><br>What's this underage harem you're talking about</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it's shit and it legitimately only gets shittier.</br>  <br>Your opinion is not legitimate. Mine is.</br>  <br>I'm confused are you the guy who only read one volume or the guy that only post vague and incorrect descriptions?</br>  <br>That's /a/ for you, people opine without even reading the source</br>  <br><br> confirmed for not reading not even ch 1 of vol 1 <br>There is no MMO bullshit. Stop speaking about stuff you don't even know.</br></br></br>  <br>That s true but I m enjoying it because, contrary to Sword Art Online, this manga knows he is just telling us a shit story. It s not taking itself seriously while Kirito kun was clearly intended to be admirable.</br>  <br> can't relate to people that want to raise a harem of underaged girls <br>And i can't relate to someone with this shitty of taste.</br></br>  YOU DON'T LET YOUR BREEDING WOMEN KILL THEMSELVES<br><br>THAT'S NOT RIGHT<br><br>YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PLEASURING THEM</br></br></br></br>  <br> underage <br> not knowing about the great Goddes of Wisdom also known as the Gold digger </br></br>  <br>technically all LN/WN are SAO-clones according to /a/, no exceptions.</br>  <br>to be fair, that is mostly true</br>  <br>This is true</br>  <br>I'm a different anon, MT legitimately only gets worse. It has some potential in the beginning with the MC learning the mechanics of magic while seemingly having some purpose but it quickly turns into shit after or actually during the travelling arc where they get sent into whatever generic name the beast land has. It becomes a story about a loser doing nothing and having erection problems. It's maybe the worst shit I've ever read.</br>  By the way No game No Life vol 7 raw is out and within 2 days we will get prologue in english.  <br>Nah, Rudy is one but people keep defending him. The series went down pretty much before the end but overall was a great ride.<br><br>Onii-sama was designed to be feared in the series, and not as a model of hero or something like that, which is a common trope nowadays. Also, compared with others he is really balanced once you get to read things like arifureta or suterareta yuusha.<br><br>The difference is people can't really self insert as a young talented engineer, nor even want to be one that writes volumes of technical text etc, compared with one who travels and enjoy his life getting wives and powers.<br><br><br>What about a non loser who dies and keeps being a non loser in the next life?<br><br><br>It IS power fantasy, everything develops around Rudeus being a great magician. Him being a irregularity in that universe is the whole point of him being deceived by Hitogami, and that's thanks to his magic and relationships, so yeah, it's not only about family.<br>Heck, all his wives are related to him pretty much because he was for each case<br><br>Eri; a 10 year old (?) genius to teach her magic<br>Silphy; saed her and taught her magic<br>Roxy; being his teacher, and later being saved by him<br><br>Made him a normal dude without magic nor swordsmanship and then you can talk about only family things. <br><br><br>For me the 1st volume was shit tier writing, but also fun and the one that got me engaged with the series.<br><br>I agree with it being good afterwards, but it also had boring parts and later him being orsted lackey made it worse for me. Cliff's arc was the last one and the one that made me drop it. I only get to read the last chapters and didn't bother reading the rest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I haven't read it yet, but honest question:<br>we always complain about dickless mcs who have harems and don't do anything more than an accidental kissu<br>how is having an orgy a bad thing?</br></br></br>  <br> translated by someone who can actually write stuff that isn't painful to read <br><br> only two chapters </br></br></br>  <br>I don't know<br>that is a pretty vague and incorrect description <br><br> mixing two arcs together <br> confusing two entire continents with one another </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah, because the adventurers guild and stuff like fucking "saint/king/emperor/god rank techniques/magic", "beast races" and "demon races" are not MMORPG at all.</br>  <br>Rudi keeps getting his ass kicked by people stronger than them.<br><br>Most gary stus don't get their ass kicked, or have people stronger than them (unless they were on their side).<br><br> Rudi will never defeat his father in battle </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You didn't even read it and are just making shit up from the small spoilers you read.</br>  where were you when shirou died  <br> Bu ni mi <br>Translations fucking never. Is Binhj even actually working on the series he picks up anymore?</br></br>  <br> no more elf waifu <br>Thanks, Binhjamin sempai</br></br>  <br>is this bait?<br>He literally only had sex with women he took responsibility for.<br><br>He even waited for them to reach 'legal age'.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure, why you're doubting me, I'm just telling you how it is. He develops an erection problem because he had sex with the underaged Eris and she left him, even though it was a misunderstanding. She though she wasn't worthy of him. Super good writing, by the way. He then gets into a magic school where he meets the childhood friend whom he saved from bullies and was fantasizing about when he was a kid, And wanted to raise her as a perfect girl for him. It turns out her hair turned white because of the overuse of magic that she had to put out after they were sent flying at the start of the travelling arc. And that's why he wasn't able to recognize her.<br>I had to drop it after the school arc, it's the worst shit.</br></br>  <br>Seems like you haven't even read fantasy stories before</br>  <br>She just is. I really want to know where she is in the "current time" but that will probably take another 150 or so chapters to get there.  Though she finally left the dungeon and started hunting humans in the raws. Poor humans don't stand a chance since she already ate her mother and was eating dragons and other things on the lower levels.  </br>  <br><br>Tsundere elf never</br></br>  <br> Slayer and LoTR are MMORPG-esque </br>  <br><br>Is the protagonist female?<br><br>I need to know</br></br></br></br>  <br>She is. She's just a meter long spider now though after reincarnating. She's not like the rest of her classmates that all reincarnated as various human races.</br>  apparently Monkey Ojou is finished<br><br>I love all these "reincarnated to otome bitch rival" series but I couldn't get myself to like this one since the MC was a "dense harem lead that everyone wanted to fuck" the fact that the MC is female and so are half the harem should've made it more appealing but it didn't at all.</br></br>  <br>I dont think you will ever get it since you will never have sex but if your first sex partner,one you love and respect , makes you think your dick sucks i bet you will have a trauma too.</br>  <br>picked up</br>  <br>Try DEMON KING REINCARNATION on omegaharem. It is even more retarted.</br>  <br> power fantasy <br>Of course it is. Pretty much every "other world" story is a power fantasy. Hell, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a power fantasy. <br><br>The primary difference between Mushoku Tensei and Re:Monster is that Rudy has thematic character progression. The way he interacts with the world around him changes as the story progresses.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>MC x Fighting is the only couple.</br></br>  <br>But so far it's just the right amount of retarded that appeals to me. <br><br>Hope it doesn't get boring</br></br></br>  It's fun. MC being a mary sue doesn't make it bad.<br><br>Also, the hobgoblin girls are cute.</br></br>  <br>Brother Otome Game reincarnation updates when?<br><br>I need more double life stories.</br></br></br>  Isekai series are the ultimate proof that god doesn't exist. Most of them are complete garbage and the only enjoyable one I've ever stumbled upon was Kono Subarashi. I mean I read a lot of shit myself, but this stuff is so bad that it has to come from another universe.  <br>Any story genre is overused, get over it and find the few interesting hidden diamonds</br>  <br>Geminar?</br>  <br>This. Manga like this and harems are all OK in moderation and if you accept them for what they are. They're like junk food. Junk food is delicious, easy to snack on, and has almost no nutritional value. You can eat it, but not every meal and you have to understand that it is junk food. You can't put cheetos on the same level as a well proportioned, nutritional meal. <br><br>That's what manga like this is. Cheetos. Enjoy them sometimes, but read other, more well-constructed stuff to balance out the junk and remind of what it is.</br></br></br>  <br>No, it's not about the genre, I have no problem with the concept of some guy being reincarnated into another world. It's all the wishfulfillment that comes with it that makes it unreadable.</br>  forgot the name, but the one about the dragon that gets killed by a group of adventurers and then revives as a human is pretty good  Still reading Long Live Summoner<br><br>series is kinda slow it took about 20 chapters to get to the first first and even then it was a curb-stomp battle because the MC unlocked some super sayian mode.</br></br>  <br>What the hell are you expecting? Some guy to be reincarnated and to be a peasant for ll his life?<br><br>People read isekai to escape their mundane life.</br></br></br>  <br>Another dead translation.</br>  <br> wish fulfillment <br>So you want shitty edge like Black Bullet cause you cant selfinsert within someone working his ass off for all his life and getting an happy life thanks to that?</br></br>  I want more of the Harassing Thief Girl story. It seems like she's going to gather an older girl harem based on chapter 5 with the adventurer guild counter girl suspicious of the warrior girl she's with.  <br>Hah, it's completely retarded, the MC is biologically 15 years old. But hey, it seems like you have some insecurities concerning your dick game, I guess that's why you're a neet and you like little girls. <br>I can't say I can relate.</br></br>  <br>Because there has to be something more to the genre than bland mindless powerlevel wishfulfillment</br>  <br>Dropped at end of vol 1 , nothing much really happens.</br>  <br>For me how tolerable the Gary Stu is is determined by how interesting they are.<br><br>Like Alucard and Darsh are Stu as fuck but their actions are usually entertaining in what they do. Series like OPM and Kansustoppu have fun with it so it's usually entertaining.<br><br>And I always love a good curbstomp battle every now and then, especially if the receiving end deserves it and the series enjoys every bit of the beatdown.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And I honestly do not dislike Re:Monster's at all. I think he does his job well.</br>  <br> So you want shitty edge like Black Bullet cause you <br> hurr durr edge is something inherently bad <br>Thanks for proving you are retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>What about Kuro no Maou? Guy gets summoned and the first ten or so chapters are basically being experimented on by the people that summoned him and going through tons of nasty shit until he manages to escape.</br>  <br>Black bullet is shit. Zero kara hajimeru is good.</br>  <br>wish fulfillment is inherently bad so why not edge?</br>  <br>Im not arguing whether it's good or bad, Im saying the statement "edge = bad" makes you look retarded.</br>  Explain to me what is "Edge". It seems like in /a/ "Edge" is everything not moe. Is that what you want? Moe, in every shit?  <br>Because edge gets thrown around like a buzzword and it has no fucking meaning anymore. Anything people dislike is edgy nowadays. It's like the predecessor to cuck.</br>  <br>forced grit drama</br>  <br><br>I had to drop this as the translator at the time basically drops TN: KAWAIII IT'S LIKE NARUTO comments all over the fucking story.<br><br>Otherwise it was sort of comfy, if a bit boring.</br></br></br></br>  <br>so does wish fulfillment<br><br>your point?</br></br></br>  <br> So does wish fulfillment <br>That's not true. Try again.</br></br>  <br>To combine the slang and dictionary terms: anything dark, heavy or controversial.<br>To sum up what /a/ means? I am literally underaged and cant form a decent opinion on my own without consulting my meme buzzwords. 9 times out of 10 any threads that start off with the word edgy are to be ignored and hidden</br></br>  Dont feed the trolls.  <br>So you are basically saying "muh buzzword &gt; you're buzzword"<br><br>you don't really have the right to tell someone off from using memewords</br></br></br>  <br>Wish fulfillment is typically used to describe that or a series with a easy to self insert into Mary Sue MC that does everything flawlessly. <br><br>Edgy has no meaning anymore on /a/.<br><br>But just go ahead and keep spewing your bullshit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mangafag pls<br> MC being a mary sue doesn't make it bad <br>Absolutely correct, however<br> Day X <br>Rape is bad, those poor girls dont deserve to be raped<br> Day Y <br>Fuck these elves! Lets have them fight my troops under the pretense of winning a sparring match means you get to live and escape, while losing means being eaten! Lol winners are stuck here as sex slaves now, but its not that bad because I used drugs to make them horny<br> Day Z <br>We won the war, time to rape the captives and and have them bare goblin children!<br><br><br>And thats not even the worst offense</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And edgy is used to describe a series that is trying to be dark and controversial in absence of actual substance.<br><br>It's funny how your definition is also filled with buzzwords (Mary Sue, Self-insert) that keep being used any time it's convenient but you attack other people for using buzzwords. <br><br>Pot calling the Kettle black really.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Let's just say his reincarnation is making is less and less humane.</br>  <br>NOPE. We're not making any halfassed excuses for the writing Its fine to enjoy eating a turd sandwich, but go off pretending that you're eating some gourmet meal.</br>  <br>Re:monster's excuse was that he was always kinda a monster and that the "rape is bad" thing was more due to prevent overpopulation (he outright says this in the novel and the manga) so he just bullshited the "rape is bad" thing.<br><br>Overlord and Slime Dan does the "becoming less human" thing better</br></br></br>  <br>Slime guy seems pretty fucking human to me.</br>  <br>Just wait for it</br>  <br>he comments from time to time that his emotions aren't acting right<br>and when he finds prey</br></br>  <br>Edge: Conflating bad dialogue and one-dimensional characters and trying to pass it off as emotionally stimulating or thematically significant<br><br>4chan EDGE: I just realized this isn't an SoL or a braindead Shounen and can no longer self-insert comfortably.</br></br></br>  <br><br> If it is not moeshit it's edgy <br> If it is not edgy it's moeshit <br> If it's neither it's wish-fulfillment mary-sue shit <br><br>I love this board where all arguments can be summed up with a collection of buzzwords.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, wish fulfillment is when an average unnoteworthy protagonist or a loser is rolling around in a harem, and girls naturally gravitate towards his dick.<br>And your self insert concept is completely incorrect as well, self-insert isn't for Mary sue. It's exactly for shit like Mushoku Tensei where an average person or a loser person can imagine all of this incredible shit happening to himself. Mary Sue's aren't relatable for the vast majority, it would defeat the entire purpose of self insert. That's more along the lines of power fantasy. But everyone that's not a complete shitter is a Mary Sue on /a/ anyway, like Goku and Piccolo.</br></br>  <br> Edge: Conflating bad dialogue and one-dimensional characters and trying to pass it off as emotionally stimulating or thematically significant <br><br>It's bad when that happens, but that's not the definition of edgy.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I really don't know why I typed it out like that. I understand edge, but for some reason my mind was stuck on Evangelion so I wrote that instead.</br>  <br>Edgy's use on /a/ and 4chan is the sarcastic variant of its IRL definition. <br><br>Like when you hear it IRL what comes to your mind is things like "dark" "controversial" "grim and gritty" "youth culture" and "marketing gimmack." 4chan's usage of that is making fun of that. lazy attempt to appeal to teenagers that want to act mature watching it. <br><br>Do retards use that word wrong? yes but they also use "wish-fulfillment" "mary sue" "self-insert" "moe" "shounen" wrongly often as well, most of these words were used all throughout the thread and no one bat an eyelid because in regards to Re:Monster it was used correctly, but  used edgy correctly so it checks out.</br></br></br></br></br>   Read shitty WN and LN with overpowered Mary-Sue MCs <br> Handful of red flags they all share so you can't ever say it surprised you at how it turned out <br> Complain that the MCs are overpowered Mary-Sues regardless </br></br>  Just got done reading through the thread.<br>There's a lot of bad-mouthing Mushoku Tensei in this thread, by people who've never read it apparently, or people who apparently were do drunk while reading it that they mixed up several arcs and events. There are a couple people who actually read it and give some legitimate criticism (that I mostly disagree with) but excluding those few—<br><br>—I want to find it funny, but it's really just sad how they try to throw criticisms at it that don't even apply to the series.<br>MMO mechanics? Fucking where? Under-aged harem? You mean the girls that are all adults by the time he fucks or marries them?<br><br>You can argue that MT is wish-fulfillment, but that applies to basically all fiction through-out all of time.<br>MT actually has real struggles that the characters go through, and actual character progression—that's the point of the story. Rudy being as strong as he is just helps push the story along, and it becomes irrelevant when it comes to the actual fighting because of how often he needs to rely on others.<br><br><br>Ah whatever, more Jashin Average when?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ah whatever, more Jashin Average when? <br><br>Didn't that translator for the sidestories claim to have them all finished and was just waiting for the translations for book 1 to finish before releasing them all?<br><br>What happened?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> more Jashin Average when? <br>Never unless someone else picks it up.</br></br>  You know, with how widespread this shit is, I'm thinking of writing my own reincarnation wish fulfillment generic fantasy story.<br><br>Any requests?</br></br>  <br>translator got too caught up reading Slime Dan<br><br>can't blame em</br></br></br>  <br>Stop getting triggered by people realizing that Mushoku Tensei and Rudy are complete shit.</br>   can we all agree this is the worst, most blatant wish-fulfillment mary sue fantasy to ever come out of Japan? <br><br>I haven't seen this, but there is one about some otaku faggot died, then he found himself as a prodigy shota in some fantasy world.</br></br>  <br>I was in the middle of writing a reincarnation story about a mad scientist reincarnating to a haughty magic-obsessed ojou-sama.<br><br>But it turned out so generic I dropped it on the first volume <br><br> tfw your writing is so bad that even you drop the story. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> so he feeds drugs to the elf prisoners <br>I thought he went full no-fun-allowed and gave the elves cyanide potions.</br></br>  My problem with RE:Monster is how much of an interesting premise it wastes. I love stories where the MC is outmatched save for some high-potential tool, and they have to think their way through things with the limited resources they have available. The whole idea of "You're a weak-ass goblin, but can gain shitloads of abilities if you manage to not die" is solid, and the extra layer of managing his own evolution is really interesting as well.<br><br>And then he just gets everything thrown at him effortlessly, and it's like what's even the point?</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I heard about something like that. Apparently the otaku is also a pedofile loser as well.</br>  <br>What<br>He activated pheromones that made them rape each other and then let the goblins at them.</br></br>  <br>A fantasy hero is cursed by a the demon king after killing him. <br><br>His soul is not given to heaven, but because of the curse he is instead sent to his worst possible torment that he can experience and the only way out is to find enlightenment in his new existence.<br><br>Thusly, he wakes up in the body of an average japanese salaryman.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I actually started on something like that, and got about 6 chapters in before I hit a wall and didn't feel like continuing<br>Now I'm getting comments weekly asking my to continue.<br><br>Not sure where to go from where I am.</br></br></br></br>  <br> morally bankrupt people <br>you are just plain dumb. why don't you go ahead and call everyone pedophiles as well? you clearly can't tell the difference.<br>and maybe you should stop consuming taiwanese-mongolian media if you are going to be offended at stupid shit like this.</br></br></br>  <br>Steal the other anon's plot and have the reincarnation split as twins.<br><br>Then you can get both the edge and the moralfag self insert.</br></br></br>  <br>An anti-social neet who was a drain on everybody around him dies and because of his bad karma is reincarnated into an animal.<br><br>He soon dies because of nature, the end.<br><br>How much will this sell?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Have one of the twins become a girl, so he can also be in his own harem.</br>  <br>Anon, there's a different between being anti-cliche and being anti-story. The former can be refreshing, the latter is contrarian garbage.</br>  <br>MC is summoned into another world<br>In this world he falls in love with a girl<br><br>Unable to confess, he is gifted by a deus ex machina magic that allows him to contact her. Never minding the strange magic, he immediately contacts her, and is overjoyed to find out that she has a crush on him as well.<br>But, the next day, when he recounts the previous day's confessions to the girl, she only looks at him with a perplexed expression. After some investigation, he finds out that the girl he called is not the same girl he fell in love with. In fact, she is a girl from his previous universe. She is the girl's alternate universe counterpart, who has fallen in love with the MC's own AU self who apparently isn't dead, who too is blissfully unaware of her crush.<br>Hijinks ensue as the two strike up a deal to give each other their darkest, most private secrets in order to equip the other with the weapons they need to conquer the heart of their other selves. While the two chase their respective loved ones, DRAMA ensues as they begin to fall in love with each other instead and question the NATURE of LOVE AND FANTASY!!!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whatever it is.<br><br>Make it yuri</br></br></br>  <br>don't know about this one, but i doubt it could be worse than mahouka.<br>the funny thing is mahouka is not even a drifter story.<br><br><br>will i ever get proper translation on slime? <br>last time i checked it was complete and utter garbage.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well at least the manga is being scanlated</br>  <br>Tensei Shitara Slime is getting translated fine, well there were some questionable early translations but Clown redid most of the early chapters. <br><br>Also the story needs more Milim.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I think they do it so that instead of putting effort into world building they can just leech off the reader's existing experience with Dragon Quest.</br></br>  <br>Isn't Milim blonde?</br>  <br>Milims acting right now is questionable though<br><br> merelypretending.jpg </br></br></br>  <br> Don't like the current translator? <br> Translate it yourself! <br> Or hope that someone else will <br> Or try getting it licensed in some english speaking country <br><br>This is how all fan-translation projects are.<br><br><br><br>Milim seems to have gotten quite the design overhaul from how she was described in the web novel, to the light novel.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some of the LN art can be really weird. It seems kind of intentional though. I like the art style overall though.</br>  <br> but i doubt it could be worse than mahouka. <br>mahouka is at least ironically hilarious because of the sheer amount of tryhard and pretty much being a parody of gary stu's.<br>Re:Monster is just terribad shit.</br></br></br>  I'm getting really tired of fantasy settings and magic in general because given the "anything can happen" nature of magic you know the MC will be the most broken piece of shit around. If they like the European feudal style so much why not just have a copy of Medieval Europe, with no magical nonsense.  <br>At least sleeprabbit is encouraging other translators to translate it instead of going all bullshit translator drama on us<br><br> Kurotsuki being butthurt enough to delete translated chapters because someone else decided to translate the series first time in months  <br><br>good thing it's usually only the shittiest translators that tends to stir up shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nah it's worse <br><br>really worse</br></br></br>  <br> Clown redid most of the early chapters.  <br>oh, neat.</br></br>  <br> If they like the European feudal style so much why not just have a copy of Medieval Europe, with no magical nonsense. <br>And there are manga and LN like that. Translated once in a blue but they're pretty decent.</br></br>  <br>there are some series where its like that, with no magic but dragons and shit with the MC being a swordfag<br>could be much much worse anon, you don't even know.</br></br>  <br>Because that's manga's thing<br><br>you read Syosetu Web-novels specifically for that premise. I doubt any other "web-novel" (hence low-quality) setting and premise would be good either.</br></br></br>  <br>Read Grimgal if all you want is the MC and his crew struggling against basic goblins for a whole volume.</br>  <br> they like the European feudal style so much <br><br>Except they don't. It is the RPG fantasy world that they like. Even game of thrones have super natural elements in it.</br></br></br>  So anyone else find it funny that KnK was collectively dropped by the whole team, and they all deleted their blogs?  <br> KnK <br>I meant KnW (Konjiki no WordMaster)</br></br>  What if you don't wish to be all powerful nor to have a harem at your beck and call?<br><br>Can you enjoy it then?</br></br>  <br>post the page. in part that I read it was cyanide</br>  <br>you can always read yaoi doujins anon.</br>  <br> What if you don't wish to be all powerful nor to have a harem at your beck and call? <br><br>Is that even possible?<br><br>I mean maybe the latter if you are female, but.</br></br></br></br></br>   tfw no more funtimes with Anri accidentally breaking things   <br>Why would I want a harem when I can have the perfect girl?</br>  <br>You're thinking of a completely different scene. In the beginning he gives poison to the captured females in the cave. Later on some elves attack the goblins with the intention of making them their slaves and using them in a war the elves are fighting with the humans. Of course Rou and the goblins win instead and they use the surviving elves as basically sex slaves after Rou drugs them all with various aphrodisiacs and things. And yes the male elves included.</br>  <br> when I can be the perfect girl?* <br>Fixed it for you.</br></br>  <br>Be the perfect girl and have the perfect girl as well? That actually is better.</br>  <br>Really? That's a shame, I was looking forward to the reunion with Muir.</br>  <br>what about the perfect girl AND a harem, or better yet, a harem of perfect girls?<br><br><br><br>Be a Perfect girl and have a harem of perfect girls is BEST</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Is that even possible? <br><br>What if I feel like I'm already powerful enough, and I've got all the girls I want? This doesn't fulfill any wish for me, yet I still enjoy it.</br></br></br>  <br>On the plus side, we'll get a light novel with illustrations and shit.</br>  <br><br>http://konjikiupdate.weebly.com/<br><br>Doesn't appear to be dropped yet,<br>If it were I would be sad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That reminds me, wasn't Tilea's Worries getting a LN too?</br>  <br>Still don't believe there's a limit to how much power and women a person can have.<br><br>I mean yeah people can be content but still.</br></br></br>  <br>Tensai Slime loses a lot of points for having slime be in humanoid form the majority of the time upon gaining that power.<br><br>Does it ever change back to having the MC prioritize being in slime form over humanoid form?</br></br></br>  Goddamnit I had to find this thread just as I was heading to get some sleep.<br>Moonfag here, I read a lot of webnovels. <br><br><br>There are at least two long running fairly popular isekai novels on Narou that have published novels, that doesn't have any magic. <br><br>Seiun Ni Kakeru (n6470bm) - Run through the blue clouds<br>A blacksmith from modern Japan finds himself in an ancient world. It's not clear if this is isekai or simple time travel. <br>The world's culture level is BC level, bronze is the main metal. Protagonist finds himself a wife and settles down pretty much as soon the story begins. There's no moe, no harem, no wizards, no monsters, nada. Just protagonist slowly advancing his village with technology thousands of years ahead (Steel crafting, watermills, mechanized agriculture using mills, etc). It's a good read, but doesn't really feel like a web novel for otaku. Very down to earth. <br><br>I won 4 billion yen in lottery, moving to alternate world (n2163n): <br>This one is more in line with other Narou novels. Harem, light hearted, fantasy, etc. <br>Except there's no magic, wizards, or monsters. No video game rules. And this is also bronze era ancient world and technological development like the one above. <br>Except, protagonist basically finds a gate to another world in old mansion he inherited. Using massive wealth won from lottery (about 40 million USD) he brings tons of material he buys from Japan. The ancient culture thinks he's a god sent from heavens to end famine and bring glory. <br><br>Both of these have been running for a while and have novels published.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it was.</br>  <br><br>Yeah just found it.</br></br>  <br>i swear i love this series so much.<br>its just so hilariously dumb.<br> the main character is literally stronger then god <br> way too retarded to realize it <br> gets a giant horde of demonic minions that she thinks are all chunni fucks <br> including her sister whos the reincarnation of a demon general </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I won 4 billion yen in lottery, moving to alternate world <br>This one has some translated chapters too.</br></br>  <br>   That scene with the mc fighting against the dragon god and losing<br> That fucking desperation </br> <br>Has to be highlight of that ln</br></br>  <br> Still don't believe there's a limit to how much power and women a person can have. <br><br><br>This isn't about "Can have". It's about "Wants".</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well Death March's MC only wanted a vacation and look what he ended up with.</br>  Did the Arifureta translations die at vol 10?  <br>No? I mean there are only like 7 or 8 volumes of story. It's about to end too, it's at the final battle now.</br>  <br>cont'd <br><br>Tensei shitara Slime was pretty decent, it's extremely over-powered in the end to cosmic level though. Protagonist is basically God by the end. If you don't like that type, you should probably stop. The end was very well wrapped up though, of all the OP power fantasy narou, it's one of the better ones. <br><br>Re: Zero is a very good read, and now that it's getting animated I hope they do 2 cours. It does get pretty edgy, and the writer is a sadist who seem to love making the protagonist suffer to no ends. I don't think it's for everyone, but if you're tired of OP heroes and self-insert fantasy, Re:Zero might be for you. I think it's one of the better written ones on Narou.<br><br>My current favorites in my bookmarks: <br><br>Realist Hero's Reconstruction of Kingdom (n3963ce)<br>Harem, hero/maou, protagonist is OP through knowledge alone, fairly light-hearted. <br>Protagonist is a politics and sociology obsessed intellect, who rather reform a country than go on a silly RPG journey to kill demon lord. Decent read, lots of fun historical references. <br><br>If you're a man, you gotta aim to be lord of your own nation (n9511bs)<br>Isekai tensei, no harem, old man protagonist, cynical protagonist, RPG fantasy. <br>A lot of cliche setting with video-game like world, reincarnation, etc. <br>The protagonist's goal is to become a king of a new nation. As a 50 year old married man who died in a bus-train collision, he's pretty smart and mature. <br>The twist though is, all 40 people who died in the accident were reincarnated around the world at the same time. The story follows the lives of all 40, and weave their fate into the story. It's pretty neat how so many plots converge slowly to form two factions of reincarnated Japanese, having similar goals of ruling a nation, leading to eventual clash.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's counting the volumes the way Japtem counts them (which is retarded as fuck)</br>  <br>I mean there is whole volume of only summaries there instead of translation?</br>  <br>yeah that too<br><br>I mean a lot of women might be too much for one man to take.<br>But if said guy also had unlimited power that flaw goes away.<br><br>Still don't see how lack of desire for both is possible</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That last one sounds awesome.</br>  <br>The entire timetravel shit really pissed me off, I'd rather had Orsted save Roxy instead of a future Rudy.<br>But I still very much enjoyed the entire Story. <br>But the further the story went on, the weaker it got. 7-12 was the most enjoyable part, especially when Eris finally got the D.<br><br>But later on the only redeeming factor was Rudy literally going against god to save his family, he would've slit ariels throat without thinking twice if it would've been a way to save his family. Gotta have respect for so much determination.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The goblins in Tensei slime are cuter.</br>  <br>Rigurdo's change always amuses me.</br>  <br> The entire timetravel shit really pissed me off, I'd rather had Orsted save Roxy instead of a future Rudy. <br><br><br>yeah but then we wouldn't have future Rudi</br></br></br></br>  <br>He got kissed by a pretty black flower.</br>  <br>The only good thing about future Rudy was that he fucked his mom and his sisters.</br>  <br>Dem gains.<br>Need more stuff with gobbos.</br></br>  <br>this, him being a family man was the saving grace later on.</br>  <br>I don't remember that.</br>  <br> I'd rather had Orsted save Roxy instead of a future Rudy <br>Well, then Orsted would have had to know about it all, which would also change Riria's story, and how Rudy was actually reincarnated.</br></br>  <br>Still think future Rudi was made for those people that wanted Rudi to be more violent and aggressive <br><br> Rudi is a bitch he should fight and kill more people! <br> why should he kill people? <br> Because he would be more alpha and less beta that way </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Thusly, he wakes up in the body of an average japanese salaryman. <br>Just kill me now.</br></br>  <br>cont'd<br><br>Random cliche Narou novels that's pretty enjoyable despite being cliche. (all of these are published)<br><br>Death March kara hajimaru Isekai Kyosoukyoku (n9902bn)<br>Very OP, harem, video game world. I like Satou though.<br><br>Sigil of Dyn - Reincarnation of Magician Regis - (n3876bm)<br>It's pretty typical reincarnated wizard tale, like Mushoku Tensei. Not overly OP, somewhat harem, decent adventure story. <br><br>Waltenia War Chronicle (n1898i)<br>Isekai summon, not harem, nearly psychopathic edgy hero, nation ruling and warfare. <br>Other than the protagonist's unbelievable craziness, this is actually a pretty good read as a war chronicle. Nothing superbly OP, lots of bloodshed, and could use a little less edge. Only problem is the very slow updates...<br><br>Kuro no Maoh (n2627t)<br>Isekai summon, Edgy story, Every single heroines are yandere at each others throats, despair despair and more despair. Christian Crusades are evil. <br>Not much to say about this one, like Re:Zero this is also another "author is a fucking sadist" story that keeps torturing the protagonist. It does have one unique element though, while the hero is a moralfag, the heroines are not. They would do some sick evil shit in secrecy to help the protagonist, while always looking to rid each other. (yandere, all of them)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>also we would've had the battle between Orsted and Rudi.</br>  <br>That would've easily been possible to arrange without timetravel, even in the first meeting with Orsted he knew something was different than in the other loops.<br><br>Rudi was hanging around with Nanahoshi for years, it would've been easy to have them interact somehow in those 3 years aswell but anyways I still think it's a great LN. I really would've loved to read about that 4some though. Since there is absolutely no r34 content</br></br></br>  is Hitogami still alive? What about that MT continuation?  <br>It's actually been my number 1 favorite Narou novel for about a year. It's slow pace, but I love the characters. <br>Protagonist has a betrothed already, it was a female subordinate (in her 30s) who had a crush on him, but couldn't get with him since he loved his wife dearly. <br>Now that they're both dead and reincarnated, she finally managed to be together with him. <br>I love shit like that.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Re: Zero <br> Suffering <br><br>Oh baby, my dick is rock hard. It's the second coming of the butcher.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The main reason I read Kuro on Maou is because of the yandere harem. I can't think of a story that has done that before, usually it's only one or two yandere at most.</br>  <br>He ended up with a vacation. Exactly as planned. <br>A little hic ups here and there but what vacation doesn't?</br></br>  <br>You're just a big softie arnt you?</br>  <br><br>fund it</br></br>  <br>iirc there was a list in the diary that ranked all the people he slept with and it had norn aisha zenith and lucy in it, could be a translation error aswell though.<br><br>But given how broken he was I wouldn't be surprised if it happened.</br></br></br>  <br>Writing it right now—expect an anime in 5-10 years, unless I die or can't afford to fund it. Probably both.</br>  <br>At least you have some self awareness, a lot of these authors don't.<br><br>Then again, literary garbage like Re:Monster is making tons of cash, so perhaps throwing away your dignity and writing pandering wish fulfillment trash is a lucrative business.</br></br></br>  <br> it had norn aisha zenith and lucy in it, <br>It didn't. But Julie was.</br></br>  <br>Re:Monster is a webnovel<br><br>So I don't think they are getting much money besides site ad revenue</br></br></br>  Any stories with guy reincarnating as a girl?  <br>Slime Tensei has the MC take on the body of a girl while still being a slime. If that floats your boat :D</br>  <br> unless I die <br>With all these authors having cancer and/or dying, I wouldn't even be shocked.</br></br>  <br>A lot.</br>  <br>well there's <br><br>Kyuusetsu-hime which is Overlord except instead of a skeleton it's a Vampire Princess  who gets raped <br><br>There's also Dragon Bloodline where the MC takes a legendary bloodline for his reincarnation cheat but it turns out to only be active in female members of the royal family.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It also has a light novel adaptation, and a manga adaptation. So they are making plenty of money.</br>  <br>He's not a girl though, just looks like one. He has no gender. Also Slime Tensei is a completely different story than the one you mean.</br>  <br>Manga adaptation isn't really a thing to go by with alphapolis series. They seem to put out web manga adaptations for all their LN series.</br>  <br>if you don't spit on CH works "Dragon’s Bloodline"</br>  <br> which is Overlord except instead of a skeleton it's a Vampire Princess <br> except instead of a skeleton <br>What's the point?</br></br></br>  <br>Arifureta at least gave us Yue though.</br>  <br>Pretty sure they still release a print version after a few chapters, though.</br>  <br> All the haremettes are just Touhou girls <br>Fucking disgusting. Not even the best toehoes to boot.</br></br>  Anyone read the re: slime manga? Any good?  <br>Nothings happened yet.</br>  Why is anons not reading the /tg/ re: quests?<br><br>They mostly focus on the adorable instead of mary sue though.</br></br>  <br>not that guy, but what different stories are there with the slime? are they completely different? which one is better?</br>  <br>Tensei Slime is apparently the better one, and Slime Tensei is apparently shit.</br>  <br>Alright, I will be patient. Thanks anon.</br>  <br>There's a slime reincarnation story called Slime Tensei that was translated a bit but then dropped like pretty much all re:translation projects. There's also Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken which is what that other anon was talking about.</br>  <br>Slime leading goblins and wolves.</br>  <br>Goblins and wolves are just the beginning though.</br>  <br>Did anyone make a pdf/epub of the volumes? I Didn't see anything on the site even in the comments.</br>  <br>I read the manga because you guys seem to like it, but it's almost the same fucking thing as Re:monster. The protagonist is just as OP, the only difference being he's not an edgy asshole.</br>  <br>The slime is an all around bro who just wants to have a peaceful relation and build a small town while he frees his dragon bro. Really comfy stuff.</br>  <br>So humans too?</br>  <br>Slime Tensei Monogatari was a poor ripoff of Tensei Shitara Slime datta ken anyways. <br>Tensei Slime came 6mo prior, and was popular at the time. <br><br>Just like all those Otome Game Rival Tensei shit that's flooding Narou right now after Kenkyo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't wait for Verudora's return.</br>  <br> The protagonist is just as OP, the only difference being he's not an edgy asshole. <br>Re:monster is pretty much ruined because of that though.<br>This one also focuses more on the characters, and the MC isn't the only one with any importance.</br></br></br>  So the ones with a manga:<br>Slime Tensei<br>Mashouko Tensei<br>Shield-bro<br>Gun-Ota</br></br></br></br>  <br>this.<br>i like this because the MC is fairly likeable, in a normal way.<br>like a perfectly normal, good hearted person. not a NEET, not a kid or ridden with other character deficiencies, but just a normal working adult.<br>at least that's my impression so far.</br></br></br></br>  <br>he's a silly faggot. never even read mushoku but just wants to state his edgy opinion on groundless idiotism</br>  <br>Sure, look forward to him getting bossed around and bitch slapped around by older sisters. <br><br>No really, he's pretty pathetic near the end of the series, I mostly remember him whimpering.<br>Although we do get to see slime bro go batshit when his dragonfriend gets really harmed.</br></br></br></br>  Overlord has far more edge than Re:Monster. They don't even try to hide the bare bones wish fulfillment, and edge pandering.  <br>the little snake bitch is such a cunt. everytime i read a chapter, i cringe a little</br>  <br>Rudi can't be a mary sue since he becomes mentaly retarded after the hydra arc.</br>  <br> edge pandering. <br>what? is this just bullshit spewing out of your mouth?</br></br>  <br>Death March<br>Re: Monster<br>New Gate<br>Golden Word Master<br>Tsuyokute New Saga<br>Spirit Migration<br>Isekai Tensei Soudouki<br>Only Sense Online<br><br>All of these are also Narou novels with currently serialized manga adaptations. <br>Didn't count Overlord since that's actually a Risoukyou novel, just has duplicates on Narou</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Overlord <br> Bare bones <br><br>You fell for his ruse anon I hope you learned your lesson so that you too can be spooky scary.</br></br></br></br>  <br> since <br>You do realize that having Sue status doesn't change over time or that just cause one bad thing happens to him it prevents him from ever being one.<br><br>Not saying he is though, Mary Sue's should be just used to mainly describe OC's or Self Insert's fitted to a story.<br><br>Rudi's the protagonist. Sure, he may be OP for some but that's just how the story is written.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Konjiki no Wordmaster has one.</br>  <br>He was a neet otaku to begin with. What else did you expect from someone so friendly and tsundere?</br>  <br>he's about as OP as a battle shounen protag<br><br>in that he is powerful but so is every enemy he fights that is worth noting</br></br></br>  <br>The Broest of Bros.</br>  <br>why does god hate mahou shouju spider?<br>gets 100 SP in hell while the others gets 1M SP in paradise :(<br><br>I'm happy that she didn't start as the most op tho</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're thinking about this really wrong. Kumoko is the most overpowered by far because of her monster start. Also there's timeline divergence between the main story and side story.</br>  <br>dickless fags on here can't relate</br>  <br> how is having an orgy a bad thing? <br>Well. You're assuming that it's the same people complaining about here. Remember that there are people who actually want a 'dickless protag' and who dislike any relationship where it's not the woman initiating everything.</br></br>  <br>Yeesh. Your taste is pretty shit. I like Slime and all, but it's pretty Mary Sue-ish. Honestly, all the complaints about Re:Monster I've been reading on this thread are ridiculous, but they all completely apply to Slime. And to add to that, the MC is literally dickless  because best girl keeps it away from him. </br>  Indeed. It is shit. I dropped when the powerlevel faggotry started to become too much for my tastes to bear. <br><br>I might have liked it if I had read it some 3-4 years ago, but now I can't anymore. If you can just solve everything with massive power or with a massive plot armor of charisma then I get bored really fast and re:monster has a protag which has both. The best part of it was when he still wasn't so much of a special snowflake.</br></br>  I'm gonna be honest here. I fucking love self insert shit like this where the MC gets strong as hell and keeps improving his abilities.  <br>People who complain about Re:Monster aren't looking for that though.<br>Re:Monster is just badly written. The first sign of this is the diary-style writing. Then there's how every bit of tension is completely destroyed after a certain point. It's just not an interesting story, and having a harem of girls doesn't make it better, not when one of the girls is someone he beat into submission, and then practically raped, but she's ok, because the MC is a swell guy.</br></br>  <br>it alone isn't bad<br>It's just one of the many factors that makes him kinda a flawless gary stu (though having him be a dense harem lead would make it worse).</br></br>  <br> Honestly, all the complaints about Re:Monster I've been reading on this thread are ridiculous <br>Like?<br> but they all completely apply to Slime <br>Like?</br></br></br></br>  Superior in almost every way  Make a story that involves this:<br>http://www.thecookingjar.com/cheesy<wbr>-pesto-pull-apart-bread/</wbr></br>  <br> Shion gets killed because of Rimuru's stupid rule to not attack humans. </br>  <br>Well shit happens</br>  <br>I like it unironically.<br> I know. </br></br>  <br> 37yr old Baker gets hit by a truck saving the child of his unrequited love <br> He reincarnates in fantasy land and through growing up realizes the food is shit <br> Makes it his life long goal to "conquer" the world with his food <br> The food he uses to wow the first kingdom is the cheesy pull apart bread <br> MC throws out quotes like "Nothing would be more tiresome than eating and drinking if God had not made them a pleasure as well as a necessity. " and "Sex is good, but not as good as fresh, sweet corn." <br><br>Oh. yeah. Uh, magician waifu and dark elf swordswoman that want his dick.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You need a third waifu to balance things out, man. That's just a scientific fact.</br>  There are plenty of stories already  <br>Third waifu is the first kingdom's head chef who goes yandere after tasting his dishes and making it her goal in life to eat everything he makes. Really kind and graceful on the surface but extremely jealous when he cooks for other people or doesn't bring leftovers.</br>  <br> Only three <br>You need to go wild, go for 5 wives or more and not counting the mistresses.</br></br>  <br> Mushoku Tensei <br>This Mary Sue crap of an object.. pls</br></br>  There's a story about a guy who became white king something in dragon something kingdom.  <br><br>Pretty much.<br><br> And yet here I sit TL'ing the new chapter oy vey what am I doing with my life. </br></br></br></br>  <br> Can't wait for BB2 translation. </br>  <br>Thank you for your had work~<br><br>Also, are people still butthurt over Maou no Hajimekata?</br></br></br>  <br>Three is just a minimum, anon. At two, things are unstable. Once you hit three, readers can take sides without things becoming too unfair.<br>But once you hit 8 to 10, no one can even remember anyone's names.<br><br>Mistresses you can have a whole city of for all anyone cares, but there has to be between 3 and 7 main girls.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That MC ends up with a lot of wives.</br>  <br> Can't wait for BB3 translation. </br>  <br><br>Yeah, still getting fresh butthurt on the blog, some guy from the UAE the other day.</br></br>  <br> All chapters on this comic are being deleted. The comic will be locked pending further review of the Group. <br>That was 16 days ago on batoto, but looks like the chapters are still there, though the all say they were "Archived" 5 days ago, so it seems they put them back up?<br><br>Oh, hah. They replaced the Credit page.</br></br></br></br>  <br>IIRC I'm up to when not-russian revealed the not-gustav, don't know if it gets better.</br>   catch up with Mushoku Tensei at the end of last year (around the beginning of Zenobia war arc) <br> realize it's shit, but can't stop <br><br>I don't know what you fuckers are talking about, but it's definitely wish fulfillment haremshit with video game-esqe systems (different levels of magic, adventure guild classes, etc.). Doesn't mean it can't be entertaining and  fun .<br><br>Re:Monster, on the other hand, isn't entertaining and is really bland.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, admins messaged me saying how it was more the fact they couldn't moderate all the butthurt making the situation untenable. As such halal edition with 24-48 hour delay for batoto releases that need it seems a fair solution.</br></br>  <br> different levels of magic, adventure guild classes <br>Why do people keep saying these are video game elements? They're pretty standard fantasy elements to me.</br></br>  <br>Keep up the rough housing</br>  <br> Mushoku Tensei <br>Still made mc didn't marry/concubine Ariel, the catgirl, and little sister maid.</br></br>  <br>I know you spoiler'd that and all but still, fuck you.</br>  <br> (different levels of magic, adventure guild classes, etc.) <br>Those predate vidya games by quite a bit.</br></br>  <br>If it makes you feel any better, I heard  the MC ate her, and have he leveled up, she was later revived </br>  <br>Anon, we all know that all those stories are written by time-travelers who played vidya.</br>  <br> Still, it's not nearly as blatant as Arifureta. Arifureta is only ever amusing when you imagine it being self aware of the main character being this huge chuuni edge lord with white hair, guns in a fantasy setting and a dark black coat. It's so bad you can sort of derive amusement from just how blatant it is. <br>You do know the author's username was Chuuni Suki right? And it's a common joke that Hajime's appearance is so chuuni even he gets depressed looking himself in the mirror?<br><br>Besides, the Hajime isn't always right. It's he actually changes as a character. Like when he realized that it if he had kept the full edge, he wouldn't be able to see the smiles of the girls around him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno. Maybe it's just my mindset going into a fantasy LN to expect vidya stuff. Giving monsters ranks, requiring parties to have names, and detailed quest systems remind of of vidya.<br><br>MT definitely rides closer to fantasy than others (see Re:Monster, ShieldBro, et al)</br></br></br>  <br>White Kingdom, fucker manages to get emotionless robots wet.</br>  <br>Too much STRATEGY in this series, not enough laid back elements. A pity too since the art and premise looks promising.</br>  <br><br>Also, after coming from reading a bunch of western fantasy (GoT, LotR, Kingkiller Chronicles, Wheel of Time), LNs like these feel incredibly game-y.</br></br>  Anyone know of the title to that one reincarnation story about an old swordmaster reincarnating as a child and living in a future where his student is now the most powerful swordswoman? I'm not sure if this was a LN or WN, nor do I know if it's translated or not, but I love reincarnation stories like these where the protagonist was already OP as fuck before he died rather than some average Joe who somehow reincarnates with unique powers.  <br> Too much STRATEGY in this series <br>You can't shit me with that, if I need my dose of strategy and tactic I would go for Vanadis</br></br>  <br><br>Eh, that's not the bad part. The bad part is that like everything else in the book, it just comes easily to Rou. There's no effort, no challenge, no difficulty. None of the girls are jealous of each other, Rou has no problem sexing every single one of them because he has super stamina and super aphrodisiac dick powers. None of the girls has ANY moral objections to the really really nasty crap Rou does. I mean, the goblin girl probably doesn't care, makes sense. But none of the human girls even once seemed to be turned off by all the keeping of slavers, eating people, murdering people etc etc that Rou does constantly in the book.</br></br>  <br>see <br><br>it was martial artist not swordsmaster</br></br></br>  <br>Are you sure it's swordmaster? That sounds like the plot of Bu Ni Mi. Old martial artist guy dies and his student / adopted daughter carries on and ends up super famous for her strength. He gets reincarnated 30 or so years after his death.</br>  <br>There were different levels of mage in LotR though (grey, white, etc.)</br>  Well, just finished and submitted the first chapter of my own reincarnation fantasy story.The fantasy world in this case is based on Dark Souls. <br><br>Hopefully it goes somewhere.</br></br>  <br><br> Hopefully it goes somewhere. <br><br>Into the trash it goes.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>huh, you guys are most likely right. It's been a few months since I've first heard of the premise so I probably mixed it up with something else. Thanks anons.</br></br></br>  <br>Hope you have a idea where you want that shit to go, just writing and hoping it pans out doesn't work from my experience.</br>  <br>It's in translation never status so you aren't missing much.</br>  <br>yeah that TLer is on my shitlist for being a sheer lazy fuck.<br>god damn.</br></br>  <br>Well, after a quick Google search just now<br><br> not even translated up to Chapter 3 of the first volume <br><br>I put it off for 5 years but I think it's about time I started learning moonrunes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here's the first chapter of <br><br>since I don't give a fuck anymore<br><br>http://pastebin.com/yDSk9i70</br></br></br></br></br>  There are just too many series that I wish had a translation.<br>Honestly, I don't even mind if they were picked up by a company or something.<br><br>THAT is better than either never reading them, or having them translated by someone who doesn't know either Moon or English, like so many other fan translators.<br><br>The alternative is learn moonrunes myself, but—we all know where that's going.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, really?<br>picked up</br></br>  <br> I was a genius from a child prodigy to the Nobel peace prize <br> Nobel peace prize <br><br> not even a real one </br></br></br></br>  Speaking of which, does anybody know if there's a chink translation out for pic related? <br><br>Chinese is easier to machine translate.</br></br>  <br>First girl is a loli vampire with basically omnipotent magic. Second girl is a bunny girl with super physical ability and foresight. Third girl is a masochist dragon girl. Not sure how to categorize Kaori behind yandere ish classmate girl. Then there's the mermaid MILF and the elf princess and the human princess and of course the other classmate girl who probably had the best romantic progression of all the girls in the story.</br>  <br>God bless you</br>  I have 40 tabs on my smart phone of this wish fulfilment bullshit, every time I see one of these threads the more tabs I add. What have you done to me /a/?? <br><br>+Elf tensei <br>+Kumo desu ga.</br></br></br>  <br>I have no idea, it probably does? I mean the chinese translator folks translate tons of stuff.</br>  <br> +Elf tensei <br>When you say Elf tensei do you mean Elf Tensei or the martial artist reincarnating as an elf. <br><br>Elf Tensei is another one about a mage guy who because he doesn't want to die after only learning so much about magic use his magic to basically forcibly imprint all his knowledge and memory on his soul so that when he reincarnates he'll remember his past and be able to further learn. The prologue has him going through like 15 lives where he does various things and he starts getting worn out until the last life revitalizes him and then the next life he's an elf and the real story begins.</br></br></br></br>  I don't really care about the story's setting that much as long as the writing good. Mushoku just one of those stories that has a super generic premise but the author executes it rather well. <br><br>Mostly because the author didn't fucking make it up as he went on and actually planned it out for the most part.</br></br>  <br>Maou is so cute.</br>  <br>I thought you quit you bitch.</br>  <br>What's with the recent sudden influx of interest in light novels/web novels? I remember it was hard to find LN translation a few years ago unless they're popular titles.<br><br> Is it because of SAO? </br></br></br>  <br><br> Then there's the mermaid MILF <br><br>wait what. I'm pretty far in the translation so some shit probably happens, but the girl before Kaori joins the harem is a mermaid loli who is basically an adopted daughter at the moment.<br><br>Also, it's probably fair to call Kaori sort of yandere. She's not full yandere because she has to accept her weak position when she is reunited with Hajime and Yue is top of the pecking order. Still, she's obsessed with Hajime from the start of the whole thing in a way I can only describe as unhealthy. Seeing how she reunited with the group was the main thing pulling me through the story because I figured she would flip the fuck out.<br><br>Arifureta is a real mixed bag, but I suppose I'm invested now, for better or worse.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   here. Managed to find it. <br><br>It's 為武奉身百餘年 成為精靈重新開始武者修行 if anybody's interested. Seems like it has 1 vol translated.</br></br>  <br>Oh baby. It's getting crazy up in here.</br>  <br><br>I'm pretty sure it's mostly Tate no Yuusha and Re:Monster that caught /a/'s attention. We used to get regular threads about them. Re:Monster slowly fell out of favor, Tate no Yuusha gained popularity. People were hungry for more so now we have threads about this shit like once or twice a week.</br></br>  <br>Mermaid loli is pretty firmly daughterzoned. Mermaid MILF referring to her mom who said since Hajime became the Papa should they get together. She was pretty much just teasing him though for the most part for the harem reactions.</br>  <br>Ex-fansubbers that lost their jobs to cr moved to LN's to get their fix of e-peen stroking.</br>  <br> Tate no Yuusha <br>That reminds me. The LN is getting an official release.</br></br>  <br>Now all the puzzle pieces fit.</br>  <br>Huh it makes sense. <br><br>On the topic I am currently reading Mushoku Tensei and planning to go with Tate no Yuusha next. Any other recommendations? You experts should make a LN/WN recommendation chart.</br></br></br>  <br>His body fluid is a literal mind bending aphrodisiac, and brain washing substance. <br><br>I read up to the red head giving birth and quit. It was like nothing even stood a bit of a challenge anymore. I was hoping the noble's rebellion would have been better, but I was sorely dissappointed. <br><br>I think after I get caught up to overlord I'll read the rest of dungeon slave harem.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You experts should make a LN/WN recommendation chart. <br> SAO_____________ </br></br>  <br>I wish then we would get actual LN translations instead of all these machine translated WN shit.</br>  <br>That much is obvious. That doesn't make it better.</br>  <br> I'll read the rest of dungeon slave harem. <br>That is so shit and It bothers me so much that the guy translating 1hp quit and decided he might work on that instead.</br></br>  <br> That is so shit <br>I've already read up to chapter 30 (after I skipped a ton because it was basically the same shit before he bought the first girl)</br></br>  Am I the only one that enjoys Re:Monster?<br><br>shit is pretty awesome. wish they kept translating it.</br></br>  <br>It would be if rou had an actual enemy or weakness.</br>  <br> That is so shit and It bothers me so much that the guy translating 1hp quit <br>Don't help that 1HP got deleted. and all.</br></br>  <br><br>Recommendations are kind of tough because honestly most LNs and WNs are iffy at best and your investment to a series comes down to whether you enjoy the premise/setting.<br><br>I'm following something like 20 of these things right now but honestly I only regularly check maybe 3-4 of them because I like their idea (and they are regularly updated).<br><br>For stuff people like right now, Overlord is worth a look. I really want more Jashin Average but I suspect that's never going to happen. It's not even that good but I like the 'oops, I accidentally a cult' side of it. It's just different from most of these summoned hero stories and nothing works out exactly right for the girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, after he beat the mountain protector he never encounters another challenge.</br>  <br>How about this, a light novel where the MC is a Goblin who's been reincarnated into the modern world as a human.<br><br>He sees himself as a Goblin, but everyone else sees him as a human.</br></br></br>  <br>As he levels up, does he become progressively more like a Goblin?</br>  <br><br>They do another unique monster later but honestly, you know from the outset with every big fight scene that Rou will win and nothing is really at stake.<br><br>There are a lot of fights later that even the author roughly skips and as much as I want to criticize it, I prefer the skip over another long description of Rou cheaping the boss and eating it's parts.<br><br>The most interesting parts of Re:Monster later basically amount to how Rou runs his mercenary band and politics. The dungeon stuff is boring as hell most of the time.<br><br>Oh, shit, that reminds me, really late in there is a fight that pretends to have a high cost, but honestly didn't. I suppose technically that was a challenge.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. Instead he becomes interested in both engineering and crafts and designs cars, clothes and weapons with a Goblin's sense of style.<br><br>And then he manages to convince himself that he really has been a human all of this time, and he's just suffering from Chuunibyou.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd recommend not reading Tate no Yuusha. It was fun at first because it was a guy struggling in a world where everyone hates him for things he didn't do but later on it the entire world collectively sucks his cock and begs for more.</br>  <br> entire world collectively sucks his cock and begs for more. <br>As long as his smile returns.</br></br>  <br>tfw just caught up and  he's already meeting Alma <br><br>holy fuck Chapter 3 when</br></br></br>  <br> holy fuck Chapter 3 when <br>Never. Ch2 was done for months ago.</br></br>  <br>Exactly. 4 months is surely enough of a hiatus period that we can expect Chapter 3 within the next few days, r-right?</br>  <br><br>Gun-Ota, the slave arc, was supposed to introduce a new character and him building sawn-off shotguns.<br><br>But Nips complained as hard as anyone has when they read Volume 02.<br><br>Hence the shortness of the Volume itself, and Volume 03 being long into "Hayate the Peaceful Combat Butler" arc until it did move.<br><br>Well, the character that was supposed to be introduced in Volume 02, is put in Volume 04... and she's one of the better female leads.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's has a higher percentage of it being already dropped and forgotten.</br>  <br>Actually he just gave them aphrodisiacs.<br><br>It took a few days before it really kicked in.<br><br>And also, Rou had his way with the girls first (if they started craving to let loose)<br><br>And he also decreed, no gangbangs allowed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Feel free to pick this list apart, I can't recommend the quality of most of these titles.<br><br>Bocchi Tenseiki - reincarnated as a lower noble who can see spirits.<br><br>Souen no Historia - reincarnated as magic butler, school friends get summoned.<br><br>Sendai Yuusha - previously summoned hero is re-summoned with a new set of heroes.<br><br>Good Bye Dragon Life Hello Human Life - reincarnated dragon lives simple life as a human.<br><br>Re-Monster - reincarnated into a goblin.<br><br>Mushoku Tensei - NEET reincarnated into fantasy world decides to try his all this time.<br><br>Knights and Magic - programmer reincarnated into fantasy world want to make mecha.<br><br>The Man Picked up by the Gods - reincarnated as a 10 year old with exceptional skills, trains slimes.<br><br>Death March - game dev transported into world like his game, quickly ends up with slave harem.<br><br>Slave Harem - summoned into game world, can reset bonus points at will.<br><br>Takami no Kago - summoned with max luck, joins adventuring guild<br><br>Arifureta - Whole class summoned, weak MC survives betrayal to become strong<br><br>Konjiki Word Master - Four people summoned heros, MC is extra innocent bystander, goes to off to read.<br><br>Overlord - MMO player stays online at shutdown, wakes up in world like his online game as his character.<br><br>Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari - summoned to world with 3 other heroes each with unique weapon.<br><br>The Epic Tale of the Forsaken Hero - Class summoned, bullied kid killed, revives for revenge<br><br>Jashin Average - girl with mean eyes becomes daughter of the evil god in a RPG world.<br><br>Hello Work - NEET looks for job, gets hired by a god to 'test' his RPG like world.<br><br>Master of Monsters - whole class summoned, given magic, MC can control monsters<br><br>Isekai Mahou ha Okureteru - modern day mage is summoned with friend who gets hero powers, he keeps hiding his former powers.<br><br>I removed some that had less then 10 chapters.

Arifureta is one of those exceptions, there is plenty of it.<br><br>Still, yeah, it's kind of shit. You could find moments you enjoy if you can stomach the blatant power fantasy it becomes, but if I'm fair it's pretty unabashed about it and occasionally has self awareness.<br><br>I wouldn't recommend Arifureta to anyone but the terminally bored.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Are any of this stories actually written by women? Because by the sounds of it, even the ones featuring female protags are still written by guys.  <br>It's shit the same way McDonald's is shit. It's certainly very lazily written.</br>  <br>I get the feeling Onii-sama's more about how awesome based Japan is and everyone other countries should suck their dicks instead of the author personal self-insert.</br>  <br>Women only interested in phone novels</br>  <br>I think it's pretty good. And a lot of complains about it are mixed. Some thing the protaganist is edgy as fuck and don't like it, others thing he's losing the edge and don't like it.</br>  <br>Didn't the LN rearrange it to the original intended form? I mean he has a sawn off shotgun on the cover of vol 2.</br>  <br><br>Quit what? The raping can never end.</br></br>  <br>Why do half the things in this series have "God" in the name? It gets confusing. You have the original actual Gods, but also the people who earn the title God because they reached the rank of God possibly in a school of swordsmanship that is also named God and they speak languages also called God but which have no given reason to be named God in the first place, and let's not get into all the shit called King from Dragon King to King Dragon King, and then mixing and matching with God to create the Sword God King who learned Sword God from the Sword God to fight Dragon God who needs to fight Demon God who used to be Dragon God but then shenanigans happened so we ended up with Technique God who invented Sword God and North God and Water God (who aren't Gods, and Water God doesn't fight with water either even though Sword God fights with sword), this Sword God (which is a style not a person unlike Sword God) was learned by Sword King because she wants to keep up with her osananananajimi (who never became a god but he does speak god including Beast God and Demon God (which probably existed before the actual Demon God) and also Fighting God (not the same thing as Fighting God, and since Fighting God is a suit of armor of probably doesn't speak Fighting God itself).</br>  <br>Chinks's influence.</br>  <br>It might actually be worst than re:monster</br>  Are there any stories where the main character reincarnates or travels to a sci fi world with robots and spaceships instead of a fantasy one with dragons and adventurers?  <br>Japan is polytheistic meaning they have gods up the wazoo<br><br>though only MT gets completely ridiculous with that shit (and Dragon Ball)</br></br></br>  <br>you should also add Kuro no Maou to the list<br>KnM: summoned to a fantasy world, experimented by Church.</br></br>  <br>Only if you want to compromise.<br>Knights &amp; Magic is the closest thing I can think of. MC reincarnates into a world with monsters, but to fight them the society has created giant robots powered by magic.<br><br>I don't think I've read or heard of an isekai story where the MC goes to a sci-fi world.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Muv Luv Alternative but it's not a WN.</br>  <br> CHOMP <br> Saintgiri <br> Politik <br>No thank you, let me have my dose of wish fulfillment please.</br></br></br></br>  <br> giant robots powered by magic <br>Like Break Blade?<br><br><br>This thing? http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.p<wbr>l?show=anime&amp;aid=8549</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  Cory in the House is my favorite anime XD  Why is tonight worse than usual?

By that I mean summer school on account of being a dumbass?  <br>Just fucking stop. Stop giving them attention. Report and go away.</br>  I dont think the mods are asleep yet, anon  <br><br>I think my personal favorite is where Cory poses as pick-up artist and aims at picking up Caucasian women exclusively - for a SoL, it's a daring commentary on contemporary Western culture and the cowardice of straight white men in the modern world.</br></br>  when will Yuya and Yuzu meet again?  <br>yes...more or less that how GX should of went, also a  femJudai fanfic thats good would be a plus.. </br>  <br>That's right.</br>  <br>Anon...</br>  In Arc-V, to people lose when they are beaten?  <br>go play noble knights to so can be a litterally edgy sword somwwhere else</br>  Finally I have found it, my very own sun<br>my   /ai/ idle activities  </br>  <br>Akari became a white dwarf.</br>  The guide: http://pastebin.com/iDebHQu6  Catching up with Aikatsu.<br> I'm glad Kokone is gone. </br>  I want to fuck Lala.  <br>I got excited for a Genei thread, but it's just you idol guys.<br><br>Have fun I guess.</br></br></br>  <br>Same, RIP.</br>  <br>I always look forward to your lewd picture of Lala.</br>  <br>Me too dude.<br><br><br>Me too dude.</br></br></br></br>  ded  <br>Me too dude.</br>  <br>Damn, that was fast.</br>  <br>Just finished it.

Fuck idol shows, generals, and especially idol show generals.</br>  <br> I was without internet for an entire week last month.

Just based on what has been posted over the last few weeks.  <br> Sumire x Sena <br>Unacceptable, only Akari X Sena is proper</br></br>  <br>Sena is for everybody.</br>  <br>Akari is now a  cuck .</br>  <br> not Akari <br>Damn it. Oh well, Sena does look cute.</br></br>    <br>I hope it's NTR and has a yandere Sumire.</br>  <br>Then Madoka should be involved.</br>  pomf  <br>You can find the shitty raws for 39 over at https://mega.co.nz/#F!yR8yDYYI!M8tW<wbr>5gH_OVZBbDm-CQffMg</wbr></br>    Well /ai/?  <br>She already has the perfect name for prostitution.</br>  Can we discuss how Akari is hot?  Go touhou and untranslated novel board.  <br>Ehh? I always thought it was Fushigi Mahou Fan Fan Pharmacy</br>  <br>Doublefun Drugstore, actually.</br>  What a cheap solution.  Was she alive this episode? Or has she been deported?  <br>She's super hot.</br>  This is some doujin level shit.  <br><br>I want to fuck Non while you're fucking Lala.</br></br>  Weird ass moon.    <br>I want to fuck Moon.</br>  <br>I want to be that dolphin.</br>  What do young girls want?  <br>Ugly dresses and easy games.</br>  <br>Dresses with<br>hear this<br> WINGS </br></br></br>  <br>They're out of fashion these days.</br>  The girl in the middle is wearing some really short shorts for a children's show.  <br>They're all so lewd. Also Wakana is on the left there.</br>  <br>I want cat back.</br>  <br>heart eyes are kind of lewd, but that twintails looks like she's absolutely begging for it.</br>  <br>Is that an apron obscured midriff?</br>  <br>I want Juri in my kitchen cooking delicious Spanish dishes for me.</br>  <br>Yeah. There was a few shots of her in the episode without the apron.</br>  <br>I want to lick it</br>  <br>What is more disturbing is the detail on the waist. Is that what they call "vagina bones"?</br>  <br>Dude in back checking out those midriffs.</br>  <br>Me too dude, tsumari get in line.</br>      <br>Happy crying Yurika is really bad for my heart.</br>  <br>This made my night, thanks.</br>  Do we have a stream this week?  <br>usual place</br>  The anime in the OP pic is not a show for little girls. It's misleading.  <br>Almost all the watchers of it are from /ai/ anyway.</br>  Just caught up with Pripara, what about the movie?  MAGICAL CHANGE<br>MAGICAL SMILE<br>MAGICAL MAGICAL</br></br>  <br>I love that image of Akari. It's amazing.</br>  <br>I could still do without this OP every week</br>  <br>Wasn't just a bunch of clip shows?</br>  <br>I want Akari to look on me with disdain.</br>  <br>Fuck, really?</br>  <br>Too bad! Akari is a nice girl who loves all of her fans.</br>  Larima the cutest!<br><br><br>Or maybe it was that the Christmas special.</br></br></br>  Top Jew.  Now this is Aikatsu!  Larima a cute. A CUTE!  <br>But how would she react on learning that one masturbates to her?</br>  Boxing idols. I'm a fan  Fit as fuck.   /fit/ as fuark Larimar <br><br>Yes, I can fap to this.</br></br>  Dem gainz.  <br>My brother.</br>  Do not want muscle-Larimar.  So they can stay as human as long they don't use magic.  <br><br>They need to POWAH UP the henshin so it can last past one magic spell use.</br></br>  <br>She'd probably cry and give up her Aikatsu. Could you live with yourself?</br>  Astrology yay.<br><br><br>Yeah, I hope this is the beginning of this kind of episodes.</br></br></br>  Larimar's sex-face  <br>I wanna lick all over Larima's face.</br>  Damn.   no human Larima performance   Labra?

I also really like female villains who later comes to the good side, my favorite of this kind is not so fresh anymore, but she was really passionate, if you know what I mean.

Except Dio did that better in every way and actually expressed himself.<br><br>Bruno was more the protagonist than Gio. Gio and Jotaro are trash Jojo compared to all other Jojos.</br></br></br></br></br>  Gay Priest is here now.  <br><br>Giorno is quite because of his "conscientiousness".

No Jojo has ever done that. Giorno did go through a bunch of shit, it just happens before the main plot when he was young. Part 5 basically just jumps straight into stand fights. Why? Because Giorno wants to be the leader of a powerful gang. It make no sense to have him weak at the beginning. Don't forget, from when they meet Trish to the end is two days time. Also, Giorno does go through shit, how many fucking body parts did he have to replace?</br></br>  <br>He was number one on the website too by votes<br>Stands should've been on the best anime powers list too<br><br>Either they avoid Jojo like the plague or someone has a huge bias</br></br></br></br>  <br> WatchMojo </br>  I think I appreciate 5 more for it's inventiveness, even if I don't believe it fully achieved what it attempted to do<br>By the time Stone Ocean rolls around the whole thing feels kind of stale</br>  <br>Thank god.</br>  <br>PRAISE THIS PHENOMENON</br>  <br>Father please bless me as I go later today to watch One Piece with a friend because he's trying to convince me it's good</br>  <br>So you managed to escape from <br>good job, Pucci</br></br>  <br> No Jojo has ever done that.  <br><br>Johnathan<br> When from spoiled rich brat with a sense of entitlement to being a proper gentleman with a sense of righteous and virtue because of all the shit DIO put him through <br><br>Jolyne<br> Went from street punk who thought she knew it all with a hate for her father to understanding the importance of family, needing to do the right thing, and stop the evil that was ruining the world and her family.  <br><br>Johnny<br> Went from bro-chad racer to being to depressed shit cripple to righteous driven killer who wants to set things in balance <br><br>Josuke is just a goonie hustler kid, Joseph is just Human Bugs Bunny, and Gappy is still in development. But they are more on the comedy side than being Shonen heroes.<br><br>But Jotaro and Giorno are just 1 dimensional characters with overpowered abilities that don't really had anything of value.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> DIO actually did deserve the #1 spot. Look at this</br>     somewhere, King Crimson is filing a copyright claim   <br>Thank God Araki got better drawing background characters in Part 7.</br>  <br><br>And you can add "Giorno - went from timid, abused and slightly retarded child to quiet, intelligent and kind". It just happens before the story starts, but you're shown it. Also, Jonathan wasn't a spoilt rich brat at all. His Dad was just a cunt. There's basically no difference in Jonathan in as a kid and Jonathan as a grown up. <br><br> Went from street punk who thought she knew it all with a hate for her father to understanding the importance of family, needing to do the right thing, and stop the evil that was ruining the world and her family.  <br><br>Happens in like, 2 chapters.

All kids used to do shit like that in the 1800's. He didn't feel entitled to respect, he attacked the kids because they were bullying Erina. In fact, they are the ones who disrespect him becanuse he's rich. The chocolate bar was his, I don't understand what you're getting at there. Most kids don't have proper manners. Dio is an exception, he was *trying* to make Jonathan look bad.

Alright I'll give it a shot.<br><br> Jojo <br>Jolyne<br><br> Villain <br>Gay Priest<br><br> JoBro <br>If Annasui would have stayed a chick she would have taken it, but I'd have to say Mista has to take it.<br><br> Team <br>5, eas<br><br> Story <br>6, easily<br><br> Stands <br>I'd say its about even, both had fantastic stands.<br><br> Fights <br>I'd say 5. AV wasn't afraid to hold back and showed how god damn brutal stands can actually get.<br><br>Plus Metallica vs King Crimson was probably the best fight in the series so far.<br><br> Art Style <br>I loved 5;s style, but late 6 just added wonderful atmosphere and detail to all the zany wtfery was going on.<br><br> Ending <br>Both of them were kinda eh, but at least seeing Diavolo getting his stand Nope'd by a fully sentient GER and then beaten to a pulp for three pages was hilariously anticlimatic.<br><br> Better Overall. <br>Even though I wouldn't rank it higher than 6 in a personal ranking, 5 did do a lot of things better according to the above questionnaire to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> dislikes Nazis <br>not all of them</br></br>  <br>It's hard to say that King Crimson is the strongest when you have The World and Star Platinum to compare to, especially the latter since it broke High Priestess's teeth and punched an incoming semi truck.</br>  <br> Jotaro is one of my favourites <br> Jotaro above Josuke <br><br>Care to elaborate?

I'll bite.<br> Jojo <br>Giorno. His approach towards enemies and allies was merciless but also very polite, a perfect successor to Jonathan. Jolyne did shit all.<br> Villain <br>Pucci. Crackhead Diavolo had the more interesting stand with time erasure, but Gay Priest's charisma almost equaled DIO's. <br> JoBro <br>I'll give this one to Hermes, since Bruno was almost leeching the protagonist chair away from Giorno. That's not something a JoBro would do.<br> Team <br>Part 5. Part 6 was all over the goddamn place with no concentration, VA squad could rival SC's in camaraderie and stand ability per member. Narancia is also a cuter girl than FF, all things considered. <br> Story <br>Part 5. Part 6 fights were shit save Ungalo and HW. Part 5 was filled with OP stand fights like Black Sabbath, Grateful Dead, White Album, Metallica, Requiem and of course King Crimson<br> Stands <br>Part 5. All OP as hell, fighting against each other. VA is like the DBZ to DB portion of JoJo.<br> Fights <br>Part 5 again, consistently good fights. Part 6 fights were more situational anyway, even the memorable ones like UW involved placing yourself in a certain position just to survive and beat up the user later. Following a baby and getting smaller isn't threatening either.<br> Art Style <br>5. I really want to give something to 6, but a good chunk of 6 features the worst artstyle Araki has ever had, which thankfully healed up by Part 7. At least 5 has remnants of good lip/face structure from Part 4 + all that fashionable clothing<br> Ending <br>Both were shit, but I'll give this one to Part 5 considering it gave birth to the most OP ability in fictional history and the fact that its JoJo actually won the final battle. <br> Better Overall <br>Part 5 obviously. And you know, I like Part 6. Even if it was a standalone manga it's still something I probably would have read, but Part 5 is just a fantastic arc that feels like streamlined Part 3. Granted it's still not the best, but it's definitely close.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"Super Strength: King Crimson is one of the strongest Stands, rivaling Star Platinum, The World, and Crazy Diamond. "</br>  <br> I have read a properly translated Part 5 </br>  <br>I dont like the way Josuke acts, I got bored of his hair act soon, I never liked his personality all that much, and the vibe I got from him was kinda douchey, I like Jotaro more, because I prefer his design, He was much more intelligent then he seemed, I never felt a douchey/ asshole vibe from him except his introduction, I found him to have a nice character, and I really liked how close he was with Joseph at times, never got a tightknit family vibe like that from Josuke except from when he wanted revenge for his dad</br>  <br>This is exactly how I feel about Josuke and Jotaro</br>  <br>good post</br>  <br>wow, someone who agrees with me, first person I've ever seen who thinks Jotaro &gt; Josuke</br>  <br> planet waves <br> good </br></br>  <br>Thanks anon</br>  Meppz are you here?  Now, new topic. Who is the best looking JoJo?<br><br>I'd say that it's a tie between Giorno and stripper Joseph.</br></br>  <br> Part 1 <br> First mansion fight <br><br> Part 4 <br> Highway Star <br><br>Excellent taste.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hard to say when they're all good looking</br>  <br>If we're going by canon clothes, I'd say Jonathan.</br>  <br> He doesn't like the Westwood fight </br>  <br>Agreed for all except<br> 5 <br>first king crimson encounter is best<br> 6 <br>Made in heaven/ C-moon is best</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gyro, easily.<br><br>Nyo~ho</br></br></br>  <br>I find Jotaro really attractive, though Jonathan wins out</br>  <br> The villain literally comes out of nowhere and doenst have any reason for anything was doing <br>No reason besides being a mafia boss with some serious mental issues and a daughter prancing around that, in his mind, could potentially become a threat later? It's more reason than Kira had to become a villain, since he was pretty much just a regular guy with a fucked up fetish.<br><br> And the protagonists ambition is just "I wanna be the best there ever was like no one ever was." <br>His ambition was actually to become like the only person who ever showed him respect and work beyond the law to actually help people. He flat out says that to Bruno after they fight, it's like you didn't even read this part.<br><br> Fights are great, but you can't pretend part 5 had a story, or is even connected to the overall arc of Jojo other than "muh arrow" <br>It has way more relevance to overarching story than part 4, and is a direct continuation to part 3 instead of being a slice of life with Jotaro, Joseph's bastard son, and the arrow thrown in the mix.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ringo the guy who had Mandom</br>  <br> watching One Piece <br>You're supposed to only read the manga.</br></br>  <br>Jotaro.</br>  <br> part 4 <br>- ties up loose ends with Dio<br>- explains where non-natural stand users (like kenny G, Cream, and Dio) come from<br>- Show Jotaro continuing to keep the worlds supernatural shit on lockdown with the speedwagon foundation<br><br> Part 5 <br>- shows here enya got the Stand arrows, from a guy who just got them through an engimatic means that only raises more questions<br>- has another offshoot joestar descendant from a vampire-human hybrid that using a human body somehow mixing Johnathan and Dio together that doesn't really add to the overarching "sealing up Dios loose ends" of the rest of the series.

Just Dio's rape baby trying to be a gangster against an even more engimatic enemy. <br>Except, you know, Dio's lineage continues to be relevant all the way down to the end of the fucking universe.

The whole part 4 arc is merely incidental, especially regarding the villain.<br><br> Yeah but that shit never actually came full circle and Gio was just a side note in part 6 where DIO SONS were literally a crucial plot point.  <br>It didn't come full circle because Giorno wasn't trying to reset the fucking universe. Jotaro had to check if Giorno wanted revenge for what they did to Dio and his existence alone already connects parts 3 and 6, even if Araki didn't use him in the latter.<br><br> Its like Araki knew he was a terrible character and just needed him out of the way. <br>You're too biased, anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly only Big was a threat, every other villain he just wolverine'd it.<br><br>As for changing, befriending the gang didn't add anything to his character.

That it's chin thing.</br>  <br> Pucci, why the fuck do we even want Heaven? Sounds lame as fuck. DIO? He was a faggot, he just told you dumb shit to fuck you in the ass. Don't you get it? </br>  <br> The whole part 4 arc is merely incidental, <br><br>Wrong. Jotaro didn't even come for Josuke. He came because Hermit purple took pictures of stand users in morioh. And Jotaro already knew about the arrows and all that, it just gave him a clue as to where it would be when random stand users just happened to be appearing there.<br><br> Yoshihiro just had the arrows and that was it for the plot.  <br>Read part 4 that isn't Duwang bruv, Yoshihiro got it from Enya and had ties to DIO.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Part 3 Jotaro.</br>  <br><br>Trips means I'm right. (I know, it's just funny)<br>Emporio is a hero.</br></br></br>  <br>His healing was too slow to use mid fight so the threat was real. jolyne sewed her arm back on mid fight and complete and no-sells all of her injuries the best example being jumping on an inside-out leg.</br>  Scanlations for some parts are still crap, right? I want to read Jojo, but not if that's the case.<br>Only up to part 3 seems to be available on localized paperback. Is the link in the pastebin the only choice?</br>  <br>That pose is still fucking great. Just think about how OP Emporio is now with two stands.</br>  <br>I don't think Tusk could even be considered Gravity. Infinity feels like something entirely different to me.</br>  <br> Wrong. Jotaro didn't even come for Josuke. He came because Hermit purple took pictures of stand users in morioh. And Jotaro already knew about the arrows and all that, it just gave him a clue as to where it would be when random stand users just happened to be appearing there. <br>How does that contradict what I said?<br><br> Read part 4 that isn't Duwang bruv, Yoshihiro got it from Enya and had ties to DIO <br>I know he got from Enya, but where is it said Yoshihiro had ties with Dio?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> king crimson blows giornos arm and shoulder <br><br> next panel hes already healed up. </br></br></br>  <br>Remember when GAY PRIEST cut Jolyne's arms off and achieve HEAVEN</br>  If you could have a stand, what would it be? In appearance, power and what would you do with it?    So right here when Pucci is getting Made in Heaven is that just for visuals or did Pucci really have Whitesnake and C-moon at the same time.  <br> Any stand that lets me kill. </br>  <br>why is only that pic around?</br>  <br> next panel <br>it wasn't back on until the end of the next fucking chapter and it was still bleeding and needed to be held all the way up to GER.<br><br>now jolyne didn't even try to heal until this page and it happens fucking instantly.

Build changes according to the progression of the Stand User, starting out as a scrawny twig, and eventually becoming something akin to Star Platinum. When active, the Stand situates itself behind the user, leaning on the users shoulders and painfully pressing squeezing and leaving indentations when the user overuses its ability.<br><br>Ability: Amplifies the users desire for progress, and enhances the benefits of all training. Through this, the user progresses at an inhuman rate, acquiring months worth of progress in days, or even hours at times. Eventually evolves to let others benefit from a lessened version of this at the users discretion. However the Stand only has a finite pool of "progress enhancement", and the more of it that is given out, the less is available for everyone else, including the original user. Stats grow with the user.<br><br>I'd use it to improve myself, duh, then after some character growth, I would become a tutor and help young people around the world improve themselves in order to raise the next generation into becoming truly great.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oh yeah, I forgot about this one.

Its not like Josuke would have come in handy or anything.  <br>If you're doing Castelvania 3, Jotaro</br>  <br>SotN only for now, but I think I might pick up another game later if this ends up a success so maybe i'll do Dracula's curse with Jotaro after.</br>  <br> Gay Priest breaks the universe <br> Josuke punches the universe <br> universe fixes itself <br> all is well </br></br></br></br>  <br> Josuke <br> He died from a cold between part 4 and 5 </br></br>  <br>If SotN, then Jonathan<br>Are you going to replace the enemies by Enemy Stand Users?</br></br>  <br> implying Chef Boyardee couldn't fix him up </br>  <br> Diavolo kills Tonio with Sex pistols  </br>  <br>I don't think that would work since the universe technically didn't break, it just died very quickly.</br>  Can you guys give me something to edit?<br> image, no video pls </br>  Throw me some jojo filename jokes.    <br>I was thinking of maybe replacing Death with Pucci in an edgy robe, along with some other minor plot driven things. As far as the monster besitary go, nothing's planned.</br>  I personally like Part 6 better, the weird thing is that I get an encroaching sense of dread from part 6, like I know something bad is coming, Something about made me love it more than Part 5.  <br>Edit this into pucci.</br>  <br>Crazy Diamond's power is less about fixing things and more about restoring them to a previous state, so it would work in this scenario.</br>    <br>Can you cut out confused Josuke in the top left with a couple of "?"s ?</br>  <br>I don't have anything new so here is something I never get to post.</br>      <br>Replace minor enemies with minor Motw Stands, you know, shit like Dark Blue Moon.</br>  <br>Looking better now<br> What is Shirou Sutando? </br></br>  <br>Glorious</br>  <br>I'll do that if I have time to spare, but pixel art is pretty long and tedious work especially when animating it.

I meant like what he did to get his daughter out of the elevator, or to Narancia, or breaking the gun in erased time.

D4C wouldn't be able to do shit to MiH though. Could be a tie.</br>  <br>I'm glad Jotaro died such a pathetic and miniscule death, that faggot was boring shit.<br><br>  Emporio is OP as fuck with ghost room and Weather Report now. </br></br></br>  <br>my guess is if Pucci can move Lucy and the corpse and kill Funny before the Atlantic ocean gets there and Pucci drowns or gets sent to another universe.<br><br>Funny should be able to make a full barrier around Lucy seeing as how much he can move that gap, and it's faster than a horse even if the gap isn't as fast as a bullet train.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a tie. D4C Love Train wouldn't be affected by MIH at all and Pucci can't touch Valentine but Valentine can't leave the dimensional wall or he'll risk get skewered.</br>  <br>He can't kill Valentine by moving Lucy because like her, he is also protected from all misfortune as long as he's in the wall. Also, moving Lucy drags Valentine in his dimensional wall.</br>  <br>As long as you acknowledge Brono.</br>  <br><br>How would c-moon fair in this encounter? Can the Love train send away Gravity? C-moon's ability range is huge and would fuck up a lot of things but I'm not sure what would happen to love train.</br></br>  <br> Koichi <br>ACT 3 slams Pucci on the ground, Jotaro caves his head in<br> Rohan <br>"I will die, fuck off, stop, go away, etc."<br> Passione Gang  <br>Pucci dies for eternity at light speed with Diavolo<br> Joseph <br>Plot armor gets Pucci to launch himself into the sun and die <br> Josuke <br>Fixes universe somehow, merges Pucci into some rocks <br> Okuyasu  <br>The Hand fucks up where Pucci is going and he never does any damage <br>I'd say Araki wanted to do a new universe SO ends with a new fixed universe and the Ireneverse isn't even the SBRverse.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I cant believe there are people in this thread who legitimately think Mista was a better bro than Bruno.<br><br>You do remember that he was a money grubbing jew right?</br></br>  <br> The villain literally comes out of nowhere <br><br>Stopped reading there. The ENTIRE story is about him from the start.</br></br></br>  <br>he was dragged along with it, but eventually separated from her.<br><br><br>Who knows Gravity doesn't seem to apply to Funny, but it does to Lucy. As for the hand attack, I don't think it would hurt Funny.</br></br></br></br>  <br> DIO's World <br><br>The worst showdown fight in the entire series. Vanilla Ice was a better climax than that asspull fest.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Pucci <br> Charisma <br><br>Pucci is great, but his lack of presence is his weakest aspect. It's more about his background and motives.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's a fucking amazing fight. Go fuck yourself.</br></br>  <br> Passione Gang <br>Why would Giorno care about some random dude that claims to have killed his dad and now wants help?</br></br>  <br> Narancia <br> girl </br></br>  <br>It's funny because before the anime showed the last three episodes, people said that DIO's World is one of the best showdowns in the series.</br>  <br>Naw, it was stated in-universe that Pucci had something about him that attracted people towards him and made them want to help him. While DIO had Charisma, Pucci had 『Gravity』. Problem is Pucci's stand was much of a deterrent of someone wanted to backstab him.</br>  <br> DIO's world <br> asspull fest <br>Name 2 asspulls</br></br></br>  <br>If Jotaro knows he could potentially destroy the universe, they're family being some motive, Polnareff agrees to help Jotaro and he convinces Giorno to help him since he's his right hand man.</br>  <br>Magazines shield and the magnet.</br>  <br><br>This. In a no-powers allowed fight Jonathan would cream just about anyone. Man was a tank. Kicked Dio's ass before he even had the ripple. Based Jonathan.</br></br>  Anyone hate how Giorno never interacted with the other Jojos?  <br>It certainly would have been interesting. Araki just made GER to overpowered that if he did go after Pucci , Pucc would have a hard time getting away from even with his plot armor.</br>  <br><br> Gee Emporio, how come your parents let you have TWO stands? </br></br>  <br>1) I'll give you the manga one, he had no way to know DIO would use knives<br>2) Jotaro's really fucking smart, and even if he wasnt carrying one on him, he probably saw one somewhere and decided to pick it up</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure he didn't show up because there would be no possible way for Pucci to beat Giorno.</br>  <br>Well he didn't have to go with Jolyne, he could interact with Jotaro, Joseph and/or Josuke.</br>  I love Gappy his stand like Crazy Diamond is one of those that you can picture using for all sorts of things.<br><br><br>Yes, still considering his personality they would've just gotten swept along and killed if they stuck with him. Diavolo could probably fuck over even Jotaro.</br></br></br>  <br> Jotaro not being dead from taking direct blows from the world. </br>  <br> Whitesnake would pull out some new power that negates GER. </br>  <br><br>Shit, I fucked up, I thought you replied to me.</br></br>  <br>It's called toying around and is the reason why Dio even bothered testing his skills on Jotaro in the beginning instead of outright killing him.</br>    <br> It's called toying around <br>Please no, I can't force my self to think it's anything but a asspull that jotaro survived that. If DIO himself punched Jotaro one time he would die.</br></br>  <br>And someone like Steely Dan manages to take an entire Ora barrage without getting covered in blood and its never confirmed hes dead</br>  <br> GER too overpowered <br> GER is overrated <br> D4C is underrated <br> BtD is even more underrated </br></br></br></br>  <br>thanks Doc</br>  <br>GER is overrated but that's only because he is the perfect defense.<br><br> D4C and BtD are underrated <br>Hell yes<br><br> tfw you will never use Soft&amp;Wet to smell qt 2d girls from far away </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> C-moon is even more underated. </br>    <br>why does Johnny look like he takes multiple anal poundings every night?</br>  <br>I was talking more about offensive capabilities, but C-MOON sorta is overshadowed by MiH and Whitesnake, I can agree on that.</br>  <br> why does Johnny look like he takes multiple anal poundings every night? <br>Upper left corner.</br></br>  <br> condoms </br>  <br>Yea i wanted you to be the streamer again but we got one already.<br><br>Also, would you do it again? i don't know when tho</br></br></br>  <br> offensive capabilities <br>C-moon can do more damage in one punch than Whitesnake, pretty much one shot anyone that can't be a mobious strip. C-moon's intelligence is nerfed so bad but if he had Whitesnake's brain power I think Pucci would have won a lot sooner.</br></br>  wait so there's no such thing as a darkness stand?  <br> Black Sabbath </br>  <br> Black Sabbath. </br>   Jojo <br>I liked Giorno and Jolyne equally. I enjoyed them in different manners. <br><br> Villain <br>I enjoyed Pucci more. I identified with his intentions and religious desire. Diavolo was wasted potential but he had a very interesting design. But if we are to also include Doppio, then I like Diavolo a little more because of Doppio's personality.<br><br> JoBro <br>Mista and Weather Report, I believe, we're the best JoBro of both teams. Can't decide between them.<br> Team <br>They're both good, but part 5's gang had much more development than part 6's gang. So part 5.<br><br> Story <br>Can't really say, but I feel like part 6 had a much more powerful story for the Villain. However, part 5 had much better stories for protagonist character backgrounds.<br> Stands <br>Part 5 had very imaginative fights while part 6 had more bizarre fights. Though, the way both Giorno and Jolyne faced those fights were enjoyable so I can't decide. <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128636362#p128652447">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What do you guys think about the adaptation so far, 3 girls introduced and now Suu, 2 chapters per episode (even if the studio probably is going to skip something) and is probably the best animation compared to other shows in this season full of awful QUALITY like Rokka.<br><br>To me is a solid 9/10, at least for now.<br><br>Youtube playlist, (there is another one with subs but isn't complete).<br>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?li<wbr>st=PLaWNUYckT3OPH6k_Ow2FB1CwijLzU3b<wbr>7p</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  Whats up with all this shitting on Miia?<br><br>She's a cute</br></br>  <br> leg man <br> not leg fetish <br>Seven seas got this one right.<br><br><br>What sort of life does this man lead? He destroy the button and zipper of his pants doing that. And also his belt. It's a matching suit so he either has to throw it out or get it repaired every time he does that. Not only that he has to buy another belt. <br><br>And how does he intend to get home? Does he have a car or use the train and just keep his hands in his pockets to keep his pants up? <br><br><br>This man must live a terrible life.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not enough Papi fanservice.</br>  <br>They know she is endgame</br>  <br>Like Hell she is.</br>  <br> Goes to fancy exotic foreign restaurant. <br> I can has cheezburger? <br><br>American Cheeseburgers *are* exotic in Japan.<br><br> What chapter did this happen again? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to fuck papi-chan  <br>Because of first girl syndrome.</br>  <br>Can you elaborate that idea?</br>  <br> that one scene <br>Which one scene? She had a lot of scenes.<br> The last one with that guy who unfroze her? </br></br></br>  <br>Shitty personality. Most of the time she's annoying, jealous and clingy. And when she isn't she's just deredere with nothing else to make her character interesting.</br>  <br>Is she really a Chunni if she actually has the power to manipulate death is is part of the reason Darling is still alive?</br>  <br>I want to fuck Centorea's  breast  pussy.</br>  <br> The one in the batcave where Terry swallows a a whole lot of ooze <br> I'm not even into vore </br></br>  <br>She openly admits she isn't the reason Darling's alive. He's just too determined to die.</br>   What do you guys think about the adaptation so far <br><br>It's alright. Not mindblowing, not totally shit. The source material isn't stellar but both the manga and anime are enjoyable, which is more than can be said for other shit this season.</br></br>  Cerea is my girl of choice.  <br>Then why did she travel to save him at the hotsprings when the Yuki froze him solid? <br><br>She didn't even travel up with them and then appears when Darling's life is in danger.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not AOTY or anything  and I'm actually enjoying Shimoneta a little more than it  but it's fun and pretty cute, and so are the threads.</br>  <br><br> 2 chapters per episode <br><br>This won't necessarily hold true for every episode.<br><br>There are several chapters I doubt could economically be compressed down to 11 minutes.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why doesn't she just ask Rachnee to custom make her a silk bra? Isn't spider silk stronger than thousand-folded Japanese katanas?</br>  <br>I think this is part mistranslation and part author ambiguity. She has something to do with it.</br>  <br><br>First Girl Syndrome<br><br>Not only do they want to root for the underdogs, but rooting for the underdogs is hopeless because we're getting a Snek End regardless.<br><br>That translates to a bunch of jealous shitting on best girl,  even though most of the other girls are pretty good. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She is waiting patiently for him.</br></br>  <br>I don't think she saved him. I think she just showed up because he was on the brink of death again.</br>  <br>I want to  love  Centorea's everything.</br>  <br> because we're getting a Snek End regardless <br>The Miiafag tears will be delicious.</br></br>  <br> first girl always wins <br> niggas be hatin' </br></br>  <br>It's a decent cheap adaptation of a meme-tier manga. I sure hope they add 500 more monmusu who no one cares about because god forbid anything happens other than fanservice.</br>  Number wan  <br>God, I hope Suu doesn't try something like that. There's a thin line between fetishistic and nightmarish.</br>  <br><br>Darling a best. Monmusu get rek.</br></br>  <br>What are these shorts? Did they come in the episodes?</br>  <br><br>That's not even vore. It's force-feeding.<br><br> And it's an underrated as fuck fetish in the S&amp;M category, and perfect for Slime-Girlslike Inque or Suu. <br> Personally, I totally wouldn't mind being held in place by Suu while she gives me a nice full meal of her excess slime, whether I wanted it or not. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Bike Cop will never get a Wolf-Girl partner. <br> They will never go on walkies <br> She will never get headrubs <br> He will never get alerted to her position by awooo~ </br></br></br></br></br>  S M I T H<br>M<br>I<br>T<br>H</br></br></br></br>  I'm enjoying it a lot thus far. But If they don't animate gif relayted or show Miia in one of Snake's outfits I will be salty for a very long time.  <br> tfw Miiafag <br> tfw want a harem end </br></br>  <br><br> Seriously believing Darling, or any of the girls that actually care about Darling, would stand for that. <br><br>It won't happen.<br><br>Darling is to much of an upstanding man to treat women like personal stock for his enjoyment. He's interested in what would be a traditional relationship.<br>The only girls that would POSSIBLY be up for this would be Suu and Papi (who are too retarded to understand what a real relationship is anyway), and POSSIBLY Rachnera since she's a slut anyway. Cera and especially Miia wouldn't stand for this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The main problem about "what is the best of the season" is how people judge every show, for example most of the people who likes Monmusume are going to say "AOTS" or "10/10" even if is a well done adaptation or not. On the other hand you have the casuals saying "it's ok" and the people who doesn't like it spouting "I-Is shit!".<br><br>There are some points to know how an adaptation is AOTS or at least a 10/10:<br><br>-Quality of the animation<br>-Follow the main source or change it a lot <br>-VA's work<br>-OP and ED<br>-It is friendly with new people? explain the main argument? the characters are likeable? <br><br>If we take these points Monmusume is really good, if Lerche keeps the hard work probably this adaptation is going to be a really good candidate for AOTS. Even stalker points shows how Japan likes it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw no buddy cop shenanigans <br> she will never wag her tail when they catch a criminal <br> they will never fall in love <br> they will never uncover a huge underground crime ring </br></br></br></br>  <br>You wouldn't need to be near someone to met them in the afterlife unless your implying that Lala is able to stalk Darling at all times.</br>  <br><br> She will never nuzzle her head against his neck <br> He will never get awoken to her laying on his bed, leg lightly kicking <br> They will never become the heroes the city deserves <br> Bike Cop will never beat Darling to the punch and marry Wolf-Girl, removing the impetus on Darling to marry a girl. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does this do it for you, Anon?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=UpN<wbr>R9d-2Ed4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> Being forcefed slime from a slime girl is my biggest fetish, especially if you can feel the slime moving around inside you as she is controlling it </br>  <br>Isn't that basically how she met him in the first place? And how Dullans are depicted in their myths and lore? If Daring wants to truly get rid of Lala he has to offer her gold.</br>  <br> tfw when flip flopping between her and miia <br><br>Both are adorable and both my top two monster girls</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I think they did a good job on Cerea, they really caught her cute side good.   I want to do all sorts of naughty things to her even more now.  </br></br></br>  <br>She'd only be able to get away with it for so long especially since Ms Smith is already pissed at her for what she was trying to pull. <br><br>The big thing is if she had pale white skin she might be able to get away with being out in public, but since the blue skin is canon now, She sticks out like a sore thumb.</br></br></br>  There was horse version wasn't there?  <br>Stop being a retard and read the fucking OP.</br>  <br><br>the cutest <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Bk4<wbr>bcPoaKNo</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br><br>the cutest</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes and it was perfect in every way.</br>  <br>Why would I make my own webm when someone else has it already</br>  <br><br><br><br> Set up a chapter where Suu begins to feel like she needs not just be helpful in a practical sense but also in a nurturing sense for her Master to be a real marriage partner. <br> Darling comes in from mowing the lawn and makes an offhanded remark about being thirsty. <br> Suu dive-tackles him and holds him down, happily pouring her excess mass down his throat and into his stomach till he matches the physique of a full-term pregnant woman. <br> From that day on Darling could never walk by a dessert-plate of Jell-O without having a PTSD flashback. <br><br>Now I feel bad for imagining it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that all the girls are great in their own ways and fighting about who is best is pointless.  <br><br> especially if you can feel the slime moving around inside you as she is controlling it <br><br>That's OK for force-feeding, but unnecessary.<br>That aspect works better if it's a Slime-Girl giving you  a slime-enema .</br></br></br></br></br>   you will never be stuck with an icy-hearte, mean spirited Raptor girl due to the exchange program and slowly learn to love her as she learns to love you in turn, until eventually, one day, you get married <br><br>Why?<br>h<br>y<br>?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh anon, how could you completely miss the point about Darling's character and the harem setting? It's not about his personal enjoyment, it's about making everyone happy.<br><br>Darling literally conquers death every single day just for that purpose, as you can see in . He's not a caliph who wants to collect girls to be his concubines, he's fucking monster girl Jesus, coming back from the dead to redeem all of them with his huge and generous  heart. <br><br>Honestly, I'm surprised there are still people like you who don't get what MonMusu is all about. You'd rather shit on the other girls calling them retards or sluts when those are precisely the girls that already understand their situation. Miia has a long way until she realizes she's not the only one who loves him and that he'd never do anything that could make even one of them sad.</br></br></br></br></br>  all girls are best girls  <br><br> She will never learn to trust you enough that, one day, she asks if you could put a hood on her and take her out hunting. </br></br>  <br><br> Cera with her hair down <br><br>I'm Grand Wizard of the Horse Pussy Haters club, but DAMN would I even love to sit behind her and bury my face in that golden silk cascade.<br><br>10/10 hair, second only to  __Miia__ , because  nothing can ever beat red as far as hair-color goes. .</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What kind of garbage I'm reading right now.</br>  <br>But she has no presence.</br>  <br><br> you will never have to deal with a tsundere <br><br>Thank God. Am I supposed to feel sad about that?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't feel bad about that, it gave me a semi.<br><br>I see what you mean.<br>I'm fine with it either way though cuz that's my shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> from tip to root  <br>Mmm girl knows how to take care of her hair. When is she going to ask Darling to groom her?</br></br>  <br>Where's the snek one with audio?</br>  <br>It hurts.<br><br>Another idea I had for a spinoff, host takes in a monster girl who is of a species he's afraid of. Like a guy who's afraid of spiders taking in a spider monster girl, something like that.</br></br></br>  <br><br> it's about making everyone happy <br><br>A harem-ending would make most everyone involved miserable.</br></br></br></br>  <br> assuming she'd be tsundere <br><br>no.<br><br>Tsunderes are just bitches for no reason despite usually having feelings for the MC or whoever.<br><br>That's different from someone who's initially cold and mean and gets progressively nicer and nicer as they develop feelings of love and trust.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please stop with the fanfiction fantasy bullshit. It's obnoxious and autistic as fuck.</br>  I'd think it's safe to say I'd ditch this nutjob at the first opportunity.
