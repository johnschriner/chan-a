[ New chapter. His name is Josefumi Kujo.<br><br>http://bato.to/read/_/329173/jojos-<wbr>bizarre-adventure-part-8-jojolion_c<wbr>h44_by_hi-wa-mata-noboru<br><br>http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> name field <br>Fuck, why did I do that?</br></br>  part 8 is shit   His name is Josefumi Kujo <br>I still don't believe the hobo slut. Those eyes just don't make any sense.</br>  I completely thought the twist in OP image was that she was a trap about to get her dick sucked.  <br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</br>  <br>That was my immediate assumption as well.</br>  <br>Does Araki still draw black people like that?</br>  <br>completely serious, the art, the story, everything</br>  <br>No blacks in Morioh.</br>  Karera is fucking disgusting and I want to fuck her.  <br>Slags are popular for a reason, dog.</br>  <br>AAAAHHAAHAHAHAHH <br><br>ANON STOP IT'S TOO FUNNY</br></br></br>  Why is nobody talking about the soccer brothers? What's his power supposed to be?  <br>It's hard to tell if it's really a stand ability or something rock people can just naturally do. Yagiyama phased through walls and rocks all the time.</br>  <br>remember when kars became the ultimate being and turned his hand into a squirrel? maybe something similar to that</br>  <br>Whatever he touches with his left hand is like materialized/teleported in front of his rock stump. Pretty cool I guess how it displaces shit around whatever materializes. Who knows what soccer ball/bag can do though.</br>  <br>I'm also interested in why they're hunting Karera.</br>  <br>Probably.</br>   Jojo parts described in one sentence: <br><br>part 1: downton abby with vampire, sunlight kungfu, and the titanic<br><br>part 2: ancient homosexual aztec vampire gods get trolled by british human bugs bunny<br><br>part 3: A jap, his gramps, a muslim, a metrosexual, and a frenchman all hunt down a british vampire banana man on the other side of the world<br><br>part 4: a quiet town has a fetish murderer, manga artist, and a couple of characters up to no good, while a gang of school kids hustle niggas left and right.<br><br>part 5: a group of gay fashionistas seek to find their pink hyena leader to save his daughter<br><br>part 6: women go to prison with a 10 year old boy while a gay black catholic priest ends the entire universe for his deceased gay lover<br><br>part 7: Paraplegic and an aspiring Italian comic race across america to find the corpse of jesus christ and kill the president while dinosaurs wait for them at every turn<br><br>part 8: Araki just shows us all his fetishes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCK OFF</br>  What stand would you want out of JoJo? Hard mode: Only secondary allies or minor villians.<br><br>Pic related for me. A stand that was built around my fetish for rain would make me happy as all hell.</br></br>  Just made it to the end of the manga. I've had virtually no contact with jojo fans, is there anything cool made by them I should know about?<br><br>I've already tried the 7th Stand game. Also, is there more spinoffs and material I should read? I've only read the part 1-8(what's there) mangas.</br></br>  <br> Also, is there more spinoffs and material I should read?  <br>Definitely read the Rohan sidestories and Under Execution, Under Jailbreak.</br></br>  <br> Translator note: Die means die.  <br><br>Bullshit, whoever made this image is retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>The Rohan spinoffs, Dead Man's Questions, Jolyne's weirdass one-shot, and shitloads of doujins.</br>  <br>Hero choice:<br>1. Harvest (jew stand, 100 ministands, very powerful, eyes everywhere, each one can hold a shot glass worth of liquid.)<br>2. Burning down the house (pocket dimension, ghost tools for any situation that I can pull out of hammerspace, sanctuary)<br><br>Villain Choice:<br>1. Death 13 (Infinite possibilities. De-age myself and regenerate in dream world, give myself perfect body, change appearance if need be every night, exploit dream world and memory gap to find out anything I need.)<br><br>2. Red Hot Chili Peppers (infinite range in the developed world, ultimate internet troll, extreme technokenisis, very powerful)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  JoJolion 44 was really good. Karera owns.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127286264 <br>I did mention the doujins. Did he look in the pastebin?</br>  How the hell are you supposed to pronounce his name? Joe-sey-fu-me? forgive my lack of Japanese name pronounciation  <br>Nevermind I was retarded. He asked about spin-offs. Sorry.</br>  <br>Joseph + oomee</br>  <br><br>this was one of my favorite stands in SBR (probably jojos as a whole too). Every time it rains I think of how fun it would be to just start leaping and warping through the air around the city.</br></br>  <br>Copy-paste くうじょう じょせふみ in Google Translate and click the pronounciation icon.</br>  Reminder to people that Karera claimed he was not this Josefumi and only felt "convinced" because he used his stand to say her name  <br><br>http://www.mediafire.com/ArakiColle<wbr>ction#ekq7kauz4u8ux<br><br>I assume these are the ones I'm looking for? Am I forced to use cbz though? I like online</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Then use Batoto and look under the artist Araki Hirohiko.</br>  <br>Johnny = Johnathan<br><br>Gappy = Josuke + Jotaro + Kira + joseph?<br><br>Made in Heaven did a number on the post-phatom blood protags.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not how Made In Heaven works you faggot.</br>  <br>Wat. Where the hell did you get Joseph from?</br>  <br>Thanks<br><br>Also, can someone dump the gifs of the man kicking a globe at a kid with stand edits? I can't find them, but I saw someone dumping them in the past</br></br></br>  <br>Here they are.<br>http://imgur.com/a/F2j7n</br></br>  <br>The snapback from MiH made the SBR until proven otherwise. All signs point to this. ASB and jorge joestar note this.<br><br><br>His name is Josefumi pronounced "josephumi."<br>Also he is the second protag in his universe and is fighting men made of stone, almost as if they were from pillars of stone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh my god, I'm fucking dying from some of these</br>  <br>Okay, you flaming homosexual. Whatever you say.</br>  <br>The comments say "Kishibe Rohan wa Ugokanai" is fan-made and not official, is that true?</br>  <br> The snapback from MiH made the SBR until proven otherwise. <br>It's the other way around, it's different unless stated otherwise. <br><br>ASB and Jorge weren't even made by Araki and the crazy part of Jorge explicitly takes place in a different universe from the manga anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it's not.</br>  <br>I'm going to make the mistake of taking you seriously for a minute.<br><br>SBR is not the Ireneverse. Why? Because Irene still has Jotaro for a dad. Jotaro doesn't exist in SBR, he's split between Kira and Josefumi. Neither of them live in America. Further that takes place in 2011 and JJL is 2014, further making it impossible to be the same world.<br><br>ASB is non canon as fuck. Vanilla Ice can drink Wham's blood. That's all I have to say on that. And if you're citing Jorge, I remind you it has no translation and most of /a/ just goes on what a few anons have speculated or made up based on author illustrations.<br><br>Josefumi has the same character in his name as Josuke from part 4, and Kujo. Gappy is the second protag, but in Morioh, and stone men aren't the focus. <br><br>Please consider things before you post again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>JoJolion takes place in 2011, actually. Barely a few weeks have passed since the first chapter.</br>  <br>Anon, I haven't even read any of the side material and it's obvious that the Irene shit will be retconned if it doesn't fit with part 8 because Araki is like that. It was made very obvious that SBR takes place after made in heaven shenanigans.</br>  <br> . It was made very obvious that SBR takes place after made in heaven shenanigans. <br>It really wasn't. SBR was not even a Jojo part at first.</br></br>  What do you guys think of a stand named Lankslacks or  King Krule   <br><br> Irene and Jo2aro aren't kujo but are for a fact Joestars by the birthmark <br> George had 3 kids, Joseph 2, all of which could have descendants <br> Josefumi and Kyou Nijimura are both joestars not listed on the family tree, meaning there are some not listed. <br><br>You can gloat all you want, doesn't change that SBR/Lion is part of the jojo continuity. It is officially part of the jojo story according to araki, just never explained how exactly. Seeing how we last left off with jojo universe being flipped turned upsidedown, the only assumption is that this is side universe.<br><br>Now stop acting arrogant about a manga and open your mind to what could and most likely is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Because Irene still has Jotaro for a dad. Jotaro doesn't exist in SBR, he's split between Kira and Josefumi. <br><br>That's not how it works. The new universe remembers stuff from the old universe. It doesn't mean X is now Y. There's lots of references to Jotaro outside of these two characters. The Joestar family is huge in this universe, it wouldn't be strange for Irene to exist.</br></br></br>  <br> It really wasn't. SBR was not even a Jojo part at first. <br><br>It pains me that the JoJo fandom is this retarded.<br><br> The universe ends <br> Araki immediately comes out with a manga about a guy named JoJo who learns magical kung-fu from a Zeppeli and develops a Stand <br> it doesn't say JoJo's Bizarre Adventure <br> MUST NOT BE </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ireneverse people had the exact same souls as those in the original universe. SBRverse characters often extensively reference many different old characters from several previous parts at the same time, and one old character's traits are often spread between several new people.<br><br>That's not even how MIH works anyway. Only the people killed during accelerated time get replaced with different people while everyone else gets brought over the way they were. <br><br>Also Part 8 Morioh is a different place with different geography and a different town emblem than part 4 Morioh.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Seeing how we last left off with jojo universe being flipped turned upsidedown, the only assumption is that this is side universe. <br><br>Side universe, yeah. D4C showed that there are an infinite amount of alternate universes and most likely SBR/JJL are parallel to Ireneverse. People are arguing that SBR/JJL and Ireneverse are the same, which they are likely not.</br></br></br>  <br>You're shit, Part eight has some amazing characters and stands.</br>  <br>I'm wondering. Does Araki fill in the backgrounds later in the tankobons?</br>  <br> fandom <br><br>Araki loved self-referencing even before he started Jojo. Read Cool Shock BT for example, the two main characters are obvious prototypes for many characters he later wrote for Jojo.</br></br></br>  <br>Originally the focus was on Gyro.<br><br><br>Which is why he's better than Johnny in any possible way</br></br></br></br>  <br>Antagonist or not, I want more Joubin.</br>  <br><br><br>but there are 3 universes at work here. <br><br>OG universe &gt; HEAVEN &gt; snapback to Ireneverse<br><br>So Its safe to assume that Ireneverse is very different and doesn't follow the same rules as pucci's HEAVEN. Also Jotaro and Jolynes souls are dead forever, 2 universes behind. They can't possibly be in the ireneverse. <br><br>And by side I mean that its not the same universe as the original, but it is still in the same cycle as it. And seeing how both Pucci's and Valentines Stands affect the BASE universe (Pucci's even surpassing God himself), it is safe to assume they are in the same timestream and cycle of renewing the universe.<br><br>OG &gt; HEAVEN &gt; Snapback &gt; SBR/Lion/Irene</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying <br><br>He couldn't enter the true man's world and that's why he died for some faggot kid and some shitty country. If it was Gyro in johnny's shoes with Valentine's proposition at the end he would've took the bait and ended up dead.<br><br>I loved Gyro but he had the same problem alot of protags have where they're just absolute pussies when it comes time to cash the check. This is why I liked Johnny.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who's saying they have to be related in any way at all though? All we have is Araki saying the two worlds have no relation in space or time. Is it that hard to just consider it a new story by the same author until he ever explicitly states otherwise?</br>  <br> New story <br> about a guy named jojo with poses, stands, Dio, the world, zeppli's dying for the jojo, Joestar birthmarks, and kungfu calulus instead of sunlight kung fu <br> totally different. <br><br>DBZ isn't the same as Dragon Ball and neither is GT. Its a completely different story with a different name. Theres just similar names and stories but they aren't the same.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> DBZ isn't the same as Dragon Ball <br>I'm reading this right, am I?</br></br>  <br>theres a Z duh comics don't count!</br>  <br>Yeah, my reading's fine.  You should probably leave. </br>  <br>Part 7 is all about sandman at the start, it started off being about his story and winning the race, the gyro was introduced and the story focused on him. Part 7 started to be monthly so araki probably started off with the story about sandman but still wanted to work on jojo</br>   Can make peoples' hair grow out of anything within 80m, so long as the target has touched the surface. <br>What the fuck is up with JoJolion stands, holy shit.</br>  <br>We don't really know anything about it yet. It might be just one aspect of the ability.</br>  <br>He kept some of the old rules in place because he still liked them and it was convenient. What's so hard to get about this</br>  <br>I think it's good that some of the stands in JoJolion are actually really quite mundane in theory. Jobin's is the same.</br>  <br>I bet you keep telling yourself this about King Nothing too.</br>  <br>Why do you think Norisuke refuses to divulge further into his Stand?</br>   YFW JOSEFUMI TRAVELS TO ANOTHER DIMENSION AND SAVES YOUNG JOSUKE WHEN HE'S STUCK IN THE CAR   <br><br><br> SBR founded by the SPEEDWAGON foundation literally there from the start <br> sandman literally lasted only the first chapter and then never to be seen again except during final stretches of race finish lines <br> was a stand of the week with literally just Echoes act 2 and died pointlessly. <br> gyro was on the crest of the series from the very start showing he was gonna be the MC from the start. First chapter is even about training in the native lands with the steel ball against the wall <br> Sandman had a stand from the start <br> abdul literally in the second chapter. <br><br>People who keep up this "SBR was its own series" meme really need to face reality.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Literally Killer Queen, but just makes things hot instead of bombs. </br>  <br>Nah, why would I do that? It was clearly defined. Karera on the other hand has only used hers for stealing and con artistry so far.</br>  <br>Whatever dude.</br>  <br>Josefumi is dead, anon.</br>  <br>Not even that because it only works if someone uses a swiping motion, not just being touched and a big part of KQ is getting rid of all proof of it being used on something. <br><br>It's great because the apparently limited ability means the usage has to be very creative.</br></br></br>  <br> some reused names and character designs <br>Do you even know what the word "reference" means?</br></br>  <br> Originally the first 23 chapters (4 volumes) were serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump in 2004 simply under the title Steel Ball Run. Although the character's names are obviously related to the series, it was unclear if the story was a part of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. However, when the series moved to Ultra Jump in 2004, it was officially announced as part 7 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, but in an alternate universe, like the following and current arc, JoJolion. </br>  <br>You sure showed him.</br>  <br>He doesn't.<br><br><br>I never did.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe Gappy will get his hairstyle except without the shaved sides</br>  <br> it only works if someone uses a swiping motion <br>Nah, that was Jobin trying to be sneaky about his stand usage. It has never been said that's a requirement. Remember how everyone acted like PMK only worked on faces?</br></br>  Why can't Araki draw blood? Every time someone is bleeding I think they're about to turn into a symbiote..  <br> Although the character's names are obviously related to the series, it was unclear if the story was a part of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. <br>So Dragonball and Dragonball Z<br><br> it was officially announced as part 7 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, but in an alternate universe, like the following and current arc, JoJolion. <br>So you mean that thing that Irene was in? An alternate timeline created when the universe snapped back from Made in heaven?<br><br>Hmm, seems awful strange that the part that takes place after 6, just HAPPENS to be in an alternate timeline, with similar people everywhere with different names and similar happenings. <br><br>Its almost as if it was the exact same thing as what was going on with the ireneverse. And it came right after it in the continuity. And reuses all the same assets (stands, rules, time periods, locations). I wonder why that is?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's because his initial drawing style was based on Hokuto Shin Ken where people usually exploded in a bloody storm.<br><br>And since no one ever talked about that, it's set in bloody stone in his style.</br></br></br>  <br>Is JoJo a Gorgeous Irene sequel?</br>  <br> bloody storm <br> bloody stone </br></br>  <br>This is too lewd. Please spoiler it in future.</br>  <br> no joestar birthmark <br> not same irene or story <br><br>Good try, but no. Araki explicitly stated which are Jojo. And SBR is jojo. And Irene from "What a Wonderful World" is jojo. <br><br>Just because it wasn't hand served to you in the first parts that it was Jojo, you act like that makes a difference, even though ex post facto it was stated it was. Get over it, Part 6 leads into part 7. Alternate universe. We're just seeing the past of the ireneverse.<br><br>Please try harder.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay.<br><br><br> Stop responding to him. </br></br></br></br>    <br>There's nothing that really confirms or denies that at the moment. People that refer to the ASB interview with semantics over 'parallel' vs 'alternate' are stretching it.<br>We'll just have to wait and see if Irene shows up.<br>I sure as fuck would be happy if they were one in the same, I want to see what happens to Emporio.</br></br></br>    <br>He's gonna keep spouting his Ireneverse theory over and over. Ignore him.</br>  <br>Your next line will be "You're a fag, anon"!<br>TOR IU!</br></br>  <br> Emporio with two stands <br> Grown up in the time skip <br> still rocking that baseball suit <br><br>Araki please, we need this.</br></br></br></br></br>  Why is the scan quality so inconsistent? Chapter 39 for example looked really great for Ultra Jump scans but some other ones are so dark a lot of the subtler shading detail goes missing  <br> paints himself purple </br>  <br>Looks okay to me. The contrast is just really high.</br>  <br>what is this about?</br>  <br>Just a style choice Araki pics sometimes. <br><br>He did it rarely in SBR and must have remembered it recently.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a stylistic choice that wants you to focus on Karera and the bald guy first and Gappy second.</br>  Made in Heaven has to be the second least understood stand in the series, right after King Crimson.  <br>That and Hey Ya.</br>  <br>Bites The Dust is far more cryptic <br><br>Its easy to understand on paper, but so many of the details like how it is activated, who remembers what, and how it is triggered varied wildly every time it was used</br></br></br>   You now remember Jouta   <br><br><br><br>Soft and Wet would like a word with you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That one is almost as misunderstood as Heaven's Door.</br>  <br>I'd never forget this magnificent man</br>  <br>I don't understand, he's pretty straightforward, which makes me think I misunderstood it.<br><br>Doesn't it effectively slow down the brains of every animal so their perception of time is slowed and time seems to go faster?<br><br>But instead of actually doing that, what speeds up is the universe in itself and keeps life in a stasis so they don't age, and as it reaches infinite speedup the universe reaches the big crunch and everything is reworked again?<br><br>Yeah spelling this out makes me think I really didn't understand it at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> part 1 <br>I would describe it more as Great Expectations crossed with Dracula, sunlight kung-fu and Titanic, myself</br></br>  <br>that's actually a way I never thought about it before, and it makes somewhat more sense....I think. Still a weird stand though imo</br>  <br>Made in Heaven just speeds time up by an amount equal to the sum of the users Gayness x Priestliness. <br><br>The reset was unintended but broke logic.</br></br></br>  <br> Doesn't it effectively slow down the brains of every animal so their perception of time is slowed and time seems to go faster? <br>No.<br><br> But instead of actually doing that, what speeds up is the universe in itself and keeps life in a stasis so they don't age, and as it reaches infinite speedup the universe reaches the big crunch and everything is reworked again? <br><br>Yes. Basically, it makes time go very fast but doesn't affect living things. Life isn't kept in stasis so much as the death/rebirth of the universe happened in seconds.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Spin off with the adventures of VAMPIRE BANANA MAN and his trusty sidekick GAY PRIEST when  I thought that once MiH reaches the reset point, everything still alive is "killed" and then reborn in the new universe.<br><br>That's why you have the 36 Kars, because the old ones survive but new ones are being reborn.</br></br>  <br> 36 kars <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;36 <br><br>explain??? is this some jorge joestar shit lol</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nothing is killed. The point of MiH is that people live through their lives in the fraction of a second before they're brought to the new universe. That's how everyone has the weird sense of deja vu. The only people who were replaced are those that were dead before MiH reached the reset, because they couldn't be brought over but were needed because of fate.</br>  <br>I'm not saying the first happens at all, I'm just saying that's what seems to happen from the character's perspective</br>  So was anyone else disappointed there wasn't a Sono chi No Sadame playing when Jotaro stopped time?  I wonder if Part 5 gets animated they will do King Crimson well<br><br>they should understand it first</br></br>  <br>Same here</br>  <br>That gif works better with ZA WARUDO.</br>  <br>They'll add some explanation.<br>The problem with King Crimson is that it's impossible to explain it and still keep it threatening at all, he's such a shitty stand that's only menacing because of its secondary Epitaph. But if you don't explain it you can't tell what the fuck is happening.</br></br>  <br>4 Blu-Ray disks worth of episodes to explain him and the animeonly still won't get it.</br>  <br>Can't wait for the entire episode of Pucci trying to explain Heavy Weather.</br>  So...<br>Kujo = Jotaro Kujo<br>Jo = Josuke Higashikata<br>(Jo)sefu = Joseph Joestar<br>Ni = JohnNY Joestar (a bit of a stretch, maybe)<br><br>Almost all of the Jojos in one name.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>First Araki needs to understand it.</br>  <br>He's Josefu MI M</br>  <br>Oh, I misread that. I even realized that Joline is still a Kujo, so only Giorno was missing but... whatever. I still think that "Josefu" stands for Joseph.</br>  <br>That's how Joseph is pronounced in Japanese but there's a mi on the end so he's not called Joseph and it's basically a moot point for it.</br>  <br>I'm not saying he's called Joseph, I'm saying that the "Josefu" part of his name is meant to REFERENCE Joseph, just like the "Jo" written with the same kanji as part 2 Josuke is a reference.</br>  <br>  part 2 Josuke <br>Shit, I meant part 4 Josuke.</br></br>  You're allowed to rename one stand. Which stand is that and what do you name it as?<br><br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vgi<wbr>DcJi534Y</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Hey Ya to Buckethead, because naming the stand the same as the horse is just lazyness.</br>  Kira<br> had beautiful hands <br> collected his fingernail clippings <br> did extremely lewd and brutal things to women <br> was a shady dude <br> is the brother of Kyou <br><br>Josefumi<br> was the lover of Karera <br> looks pretty soft  <br><br>Where does Holly fit into all this? Who is Josefumi?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;did extremely lewd and brutal things to women <br>That was Sasame, not Kira.</br></br>  <br> was the lover of Karera <br><br>It was unrequited back then, though they did kiss at least once. He wasn't interested in a relationship with her.</br></br></br>  <br>No, I'm really glad it wasn't done. It would have been an overused gimmick if it had been repeated, and honestly the theme of the fight doesn't seem to match the song (maybe it's because it's dark, or something else, or maybe it's because I just wouldn't want it done twice, I'm not sure). It does seem fitting to have that important song to tie together the actual end of Dio (even though Dio has a lasting effect shown in later parts), but the end of part 2 fight with the volcano just seemed to fit so much better since there was a long time for it to be played, and it was just such an epic, lucky ending. Maybe the song shows the end of hamon, idk...lol</br>  <br>No, Sasame was trying to attack Kira himself, not knowing he had already died. The photoalbum of lewd acts was done by Kira, I believe....</br>  <br>Sono Chi No Sadame means "Destiny of your/that blood".<br>Finishing Kars doesn't really fit. Finally killing DIO does.</br></br>  <br>nevermind I'm wrong, fuck my post</br>  <br>Yeah I agree with you there totally.<br><br>The way the fight went though, I don't think sticking the song in there would have been good. But this is probably from me just already really enjoying the Part 2 ending with the song, and not wanting a similar ending repeated.</br></br></br>  <br>The song is a loud and triumphant one, much like Joseph is after gloating and cheering seeing Kars shot up into the sky. The song just doesn't seem to match Jotaro's personality, which I think is generally fairly calm and controlled (even when angered, or at least he doesn't express himself much).</br>  <br>You know, Josuke could probably go for a harem ending if he didn't reject everyone but his waifu so completely.<br><br>Karera at the very least doesn't seem like the kind of girl who'd be entirely against sharing.</br></br></br>  <br>are you saying classy karera is a whore?</br>  Is there a storytime of the latest chapter in the archive?  <br><br> Jojo plays with his balls <br> girl likes that and rescues him <br> has fetish for hooked men <br> stays at strange man's house <br> Jealous cuck <br> fight people who are rockhard </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the original Josuke will never have a waifu <br><br>If Okuyasu can more than make up for that, then that makes him better than Speedwagon.</br></br></br>  <br>Josuke is gay.</br>  <br>He can still have a waifu.</br>  Does anyone have that picture of Joseph running from DIO with a transparent background?    What is your excuse for not reading the manga raw? From what I see there are small hiragana/katakana near the kanji. It's completly readable and at this point you should know basic japanese already.  <br>why should I know basic japanese already?</br>  <br>hello newfag</br>  What are the "fura" SFX supposed to mean?  <br> I thought he was eating her out </br>  <br>http://thejadednetwork.com/sfx/brow<wbr>se/fura_fura/<br><br>She's staggering around like she's drunk for some reason.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Like what? Like black people?</br>  <br>How is anyone who doesn't understand moon supposed to know that?<br>HWMN should just leave the sound effects alone and not even typeset if they're not going to translate them.</br></br>  <br> implying that wasn't going to be her payment for growing the guy's hair back <br><br>Doujins when?</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you, friend.</br>  I did an "episode" prediction for a part 4 anime and I arrived at 58 episodes. Did anyone else try this? (Don't tell me I'm autistic, I've already gone way beyond autism)<br><br> mfw Tarzan Boy is one of the EDs </br></br>  <br>I'm sure you could come up with a more appropriately creative scenario for a Jojo character.<br><br>Too bad the answer to the question is still never.</br></br></br>  <br>They finally stopped using the 「weeb quotation marks」 so they're making some progress.</br>  <br> I'm a little scared to get creative with the girl whose stand is "make hair grow rapidly anywhere she wants". I don't need any more fetishes. </br>  Jesus fuck.  <br>King Crimson causes frame skips/game stuttering IRL<br><br>there, that's how KC works</br></br></br>  <br>and just to clarify, let's say at any time during that time that was skipped, if Diavolo's arm got cut off, he would still have his arm because anything that happened during the time skip was erased??</br>  <br>No. <br><br><br>Extremely bad example</br></br></br></br>  <br> Valentine's stand can go to alternate universes <br> therefore there are alternate universes <br> therefore SBR and Ireneverse are not necessarily the same universe <br> therefore all the evidence pointing to it not being the same universe means that it's not the same universe <br>pretty fucking simple</br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127294510 <br>Not that anon, but here it goes again<br><br><br> Diavolo sees what is about to occur within the next 10 seconds with Epitaph <br> something happens <br> Diavolo activates KC and goes into his own little plane of existence in which he can see the entire 10 seconds happening at once <br> Diavolo can move freely in this plane <br> Diavolo avoids whatever or does his thing <br> everyone/everything else does whatever they were doing as if nothing different had happened <br> 10 seconds are up <br> the time in which KC was active gets collapsed into one point <br> confusion </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ahh thanks, that makes sense. Still weird of course</br>  <br>To make it even more confusing, the way I understand his power, due to how he sees his little plane of existence, he could move "back and forth" in time, so-to-speak, within the 10 seconds KC is active for.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127294510 <br> :D <br><br>Stop posting.</br></br></br>  <br>But how did Buccellati see and hit himself?</br>  If part 8 ever gets animated I think Karera would be voiced by Yuu Kobayashi.  <br>that would fall under confusion. <br><br>Besides the traditional araki answer, i'd go with because he's technically dead. but that doesn't make much sense</br></br></br>  So what do you think Josefumi's stand was?<br>Considering that Gappy's stand is a mix of it and Kira's exploding bubble Killer Queen it was probably something that stole concepts.</br>  Someone explain how Narancia got impaled in the skipped time  <br>Her powers could be pretty freaky.<br><br>Imagine she sees someone scratching their ear or rubbing their eyes and makes thick hair grow there.</br></br></br>  <br>Soft and Wet is a stand that 「steals」concepts and stores them in a bubble.<br><br>Killer Queen is a stand that 「destroys」things by using bubbles.<br><br>However, what if we think of Soft and Wet as a Stand that temporarily 「destroys」 one thing, and 「creates」it somewhere else?<br><br>That would leave Josefumi's stand as a stand of 「creation」.  Something similar to Gold Experience? <br><br>However this is probably needlessly complex and Occam's Razor suggests it's just that it really steals.  no dignity </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm betting it's SBRverse Heaven's Door.<br>Instead of being able to rip out someone's memories, it can rip out aspects of a living being when they stare into his birthmark.<br><br>Since Killer Queen's explosive bubbles can affect inanimate objects by nature of, you know, exploding, S&amp;W's bubbles can also steal aspects from inanimate objects like walls and floors.<br><br>I'm very likely wrong, though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Though if Araki's writing is as predictable as ever, it'll probably be just some completely random power like growing your toenails indefinitely if you see your own face.</br></br>  <br>Would that be the equivalent of Hey Ya to Kira?<br><br>That's basically infinite luck if he gazes into a mirror.<br><br>Never underestimate the power of bullshit stands anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it creates <br> implying soft+wet isn't simply crazy diamond+Killer queen with the stray cat variant. </br></br>  <br>I hope voiced player card lines return for EOH because I'd really like to hear what voices they'd pick for her or Jobin or Tsurugi.</br>  <br>Fuck, finally.</br>  <br>If Killer Queen has gotten a few tweaks, Crazy Diamond probably will have as well. Repairing doesn't fully fit.</br>  <br><br>But he got the power after his death.<br>So it's like Hey Ya combined with Notorious B.I.G</br></br></br>  Riddle me this guys. If Diavolo is not part of his predictions how did he see himself getting canceled by GER in the last fight when he threw a punch?  <br>Yeah that pretty much hits the nail on the head there</br>  <br>GER set "making sense" and "preserving continuity" to zero.</br>  <br>No, it's retarded</br>  <br>FemGiorno is cute!<br><br>C U T E</br></br></br>  If KC cannot attack in the skipped time why did he use a chop against GER in the first place?  <br>Dude, Part 4 is about as long as Part 3, and they can cut the "good times" episodes like Pearl Jam, 48 episodes is the way to go.<br><br>One of the EDs should be All Star</br></br></br>  <br>I could swear Diavolo CAN'T really move, it's just visual and he ends up in the same position he starts the stand attack</br>  <br>I have absolutely no idea how this works. His left hand has to touch something, and then his right hand turns into whatever his left touches? But then how did the handcuff materialize inside the officer's jaw?</br>  <br>Nah man, Part 4 is three volumes longer than Part 3. That's worth several more episodes.</br>  <br> Sandman had a stand from the start <br>wat</br></br>  <br> literally just told you "about as long" and that some stuff can be cut while preserving the storyline   even though I'd hate it, but japs probably want to keep 24 ep seasons </br>  <br>He does some weird shit to get to the top of the pillar apparently, I missed it too</br>  <br>But it makes sense to call him the same as the horse, that way he can talk to it in public without attracting too much suspicion</br>  <br>Soft &amp; Wet has to get it's plunder attribute from somewhere. But I'm not convinced Josefumi is really Josuke's other half due to the eye problem.</br>   just got up to date <br> check ffnet to see if there are some cool fanfictions <br> only one over 50k words <br><br>What the fuck, how do you make a 30 year old manga without getting thousands of good fanfiction?<br><br><br>do you honestly think poco gives a shit about that?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Being Karera is suffering  <br>Considering how anal they've been about faithfully adapting JoJo I doubt they'd cut anything besides a few scenes (Parts 1 and 2 had a few scenes missing).</br>  <br>Season 2 of stardust didn't need to be 2 episodes per fight, quite a bit could have been cut down.</br>  <br>How many episodes would 3 episodes be? They might either extend the amount of episodes per season or shorten it to have another season, if you know what I mean</br>  i pretty much worked backwards on this using the info given about kira. since he's pretty much a combo of, you know, kira and...jotaro or whatever i figured that gappy's other half has a good chance of being a combo if they're someone we already sorta technically kinda know. which they are, given that josefumi is basically a 'new' version of josuke if the looks are anything to go by. josefumi's looks are sorta what tipped me off to begin with, and then i thought back to how new kira was implemented. his stand was still killer queen, but it made like exploding bubbles or some shit, so it's been established that stands are most likely a combination of various stands from arc 4. gappy's stand is also a combination of killer queen's bubble shit and something from josefumi's stand that lets it remove 'things' from stuff. at least, i'm assuming this, because him sharing the bubble thing with kira was pretty obvious and it stands to reason that gappy's stand is literally just a fucked-up mishmash of the stands of his two halves just like he's a fucked-up mishmash of them.<br><br>anyways, i was thinking as to what stand could do some 'removal' shit that was most likely in arc 4, and the answer was really goddamn obvious. okuyasu's hand is like 100% right on the money and i'm pretty fucking confident that josefumi was sort of a mix of josuke and okuyasu. he probably still had crazy diamond (if killer queen is any clue) but chances are it did some weird shit like 'removing' stuff from things which isn't too far of a stretch when you consider crazy diamond, i guess. like i said, josefumi's looks also kinda made me think this, because to me he kinda looks like he has a combo of okuyasu's and josuke's hair and i guess something about his posture made me think of okuyasu. honestly this is all some minor theory shit but it's fun to consider that gappy is like a big, weird combo of jotaro/kira/josuke/okuyasu.</br></br>  <br>Sweet fucking lord cuteposting is everywhere.</br>  <br>Jorge Joestar</br>  <br>Gappy's "removal" is more like transferring but he doesn't have to transfer the property removed onto something and the removed property returns eventually. <br><br>The Hand just sort of erases things.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Diavolo could lend Epitath's power to other people, like he did with Doppio<br><br>Bruno was seeing his path, 10 seconds from then.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's used to rejection from JoJos.</br>  <br>I thought that wasn't translated yet. I just like reading so I like to read long, even mediocre, fanfiction about stuff I liked. But there's fucking nothing except Dio/Jotaro slash, fucking hell. I don't read this shit for the romance.</br>  <br>When time is skipped, everything within that period gets erased and everybody warps to where they will be 10 seconds in the future. <br><br>Narancia was never "stabbed" by the bars, but she did end up with them inside her body.</br></br></br>   Lesser Grails are a dime a dozen, courtesy of the Einzberns <br> The Greater Grail is what actually does most of the legwork in realizing a wish/opening a path to the Root/obtaining the Third Magic and is extremely difficult to recreate <br> In Prisma Illya a major plot point is that   Illya was a homunculus created to serve as a Grail for the Holy Grail War and Miyu is her mirror opposite, a freak of nature who started an entire Holy Grail War because she was somehow born with the abilities of a Grail <br><br>Am I missing something? If Miyu is just like Illya, she must be a Lesser Grail right? So that means the idiots that started her Holy Grail War found a Lesser Grail (which the Einzberns able to trivially shit out every 60 years) and created a Greater Grail (which the Einzberns needed a metric ton of help and resources to make) to take advantage of its powers? Isn't that kind of putting the cart before the horse? Or is Miyu a two-for-one combo? Or am I thinking too much about a lewd magical girl anime?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cute, not lewd. Liz best homunculus.</br>  <br>Who cares, post creatures.</br>  I want my season 4  <br> series is ostensibly about lolis <br> Rin and Luvia are still the sexiest <br>Why?</br></br></br>  <br> old hags <br> sexiest <br>Kill yourself, faggot.</br></br></br>  <br> nipples so stiff they somehow poke through a thick sweater <br>What a semen demon.</br></br>  <br> Shirou walks in on this </br>  <br><br> old hags <br>You guys are gays right?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Think we need another supreme court ruling to protect our rights to love old hags</br></br>  Shirou was able to become a Guardian in an era where humans were akin to cockroaches, and through sheer overwhelming population a human could no longer achieve the greatness necessary to become a noteworthy existence.<br><br>His imouto Miyu is likewise some kind of freak of nature.</br></br>  <br>Due to wanting to create synergy with UBW, they are rewriting Prisma with Rin filling in as Ilya's role. Please understand.</br>  <br>She's jut taking back what that little thief stole from her.</br>  <br>Honestly Illya's outfit on Rin looks so much better than her old one.</br>  <br>For a second I thought that wing on her left shoe were her panties down to her ankle.</br>  <br>No, but you can clearly make out her panties if you look.</br>  <br>The difference is that Shirou was born mundane and became a guardian through a series of ludicrously unlikely circumnstances.<br><br>Miyu meanwhile was born with a great power that would inevitably draw her to conflict.</br></br></br>  <br>Miyu's greater grail is  the Mooncell .<br>Still doesn't make much sense considering the Mooncell doesn't even require a lesser grail and the process of getting your hands on it would be even harder than finding a natural born lesser grail.</br></br>  Shero  <br>Sausage drills pls go</br>  <br>Fuck that nigga having chocolate and vanilla imoutos all over his dick.</br>  <br>Technically Kuro is his cousin on paper.</br>  <br>The only reasonable theory I have is that the Einzbern do not exist in Miyu world. Miyu however was somehow born with the Einzbern sorcery trait as well as incredible magical potential, hence the grail war was made for her rather than the other way around.</br>  <br>Imagine Luvia in Miyu's outfit. Maximum lewd as fuck.<br><br><br>I wish there was what if Kerry and Iri watched Prisma Illya</br></br></br></br>  What I want to know is how Shirou still managed to get orphaned despite Kiritsugu putting an end to the grail war before he even left Germany.<br><br>And also what happened to Kiritsugu's huge Japanese mansion.</br></br>  <br>Why is he so fluffy?</br>  <br>He's not made of out swords  yet .</br>  Daily reminder that in all other timelines Shirou let his baby sister die in the fire while he saved his own sorry ass.<br><br>Hero of justice my ass.</br></br>  <br> sample  <br>Why do people think this is a good idea to put the word sample all over the picture</br></br>  <br>Having two loving loli imoutos does that to you.</br>  <br>She will be used to completly control the power of the greater grail they created .</br>  <br> Prisma Shirou <br> 4th HGW didn't happened <br> still ended up as an Emiya <br><br> Miyu Shirou <br> his body is made of swords <br> most likely Kerry jammed Avalon in this kid's ass <br><br>Sasuga Kerry, you're a failure of a father</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is Shirou still even an EMIYA when he was adopted by the EINZBERN household?</br>  <br>Because it's actually the Emiya household. Kerry is alive and owns Iri's ass in Prisma.</br>  <br> Because it's actually the Emiya household. Kerry is alive and owns Iri's ass in Prisma. <br>Kerry is parent level.<br>Iri is god level.<br>Iri confirmed, don't bother her about it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kiritsugu is whipped as fuck.</br>  <br>I'm amazed Illya doesn't use Emiya as her family name in Prisma though.</br>  <br>Marketing trumps anything.</br>  <br>Emiya is more recognizable than Einzbern though.</br>  <br>Illyasviel von Einzbern is her name already on merchandise and shit though. No need to create confusion.</br>  <br><br><br>It'll become Emiya once she marries onii-chan.</br></br></br>  <br>Miyu was naturally born with abilities on the level of a Lesser Grail, meaning at the bare minimum that she has exceptional prana capacity.<br>Although she could serve as a Lesser Grail in the Einzbern Holy Grail War, the Ainsworth Holy Grail War is clearly a completely different system. There's not really a clear equivalent, but Erika seems to be closer to it. Meanwhile Miyu is just being used for some rapetastic mysterious blood magic ritual to form a "legend" or something.<br><br>As far as the Ainsworth's "Greater Grail", the most common speculation is they've used their spatial displacement magecraft (which is complete bullshit on the level of Sorcery) to "steal" the core of the Mooncell (or this universe's equivalent) and have somehow hijacked it for their use. They look similar enough with some artistic license, and it would explain why there's little issue with Divine Spirits and Constructs being thrown around, but I'm pretty sure the Mooncell isn't supposed to be spewing Grail mud, so who the hell knows what's going on.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Prisma Shirou was never given Avalon, so he retained his true Origin of  cooking </br></br>  <br>I'm gonna need both swords for this</br>  Can't wait for it. Two brown girls this summer. Kuro and Nemesis.  <br>This is really all I got out of Prillya.</br>  <br>The puffiest</br>  <br>it's all you need</br>  Who /miyu/ here?  <br>Miyu is marriage material</br>  <br>Miyu doesn't marry filthy neurotypicals.</br>  The Einzberns are major fuckups but creating a Lesser Grail is not easy, it took them a while and they devoted everything they had to the process. Miyu and her universe have what looks like   the fucking Mooncell which would pretty much break everything since the Mooncell is actually closer to a Grail rather than the Greater Grail we know of which is just a mass of power even when it's not being corrupted by Avenger. The Mooncell is actually a record of everything that has ever happened and since it can record the movement of every particle in the universe you can basically use it to tell the future, as well as change it  <br><br>I'm sure more will be explained in the coming chapters but so far I'm pretty hyped how they took a silly magical girl spinoff and then made it a worthy entry into the Multiverse.</br></br>  <br>Me</br>  <br>Miyu is my daughteru</br>  <br> Caring about the shitty inconsistent plot  <br>You are watching it wrong.</br></br>  <br>Aye</br>  <br> banned_in_judo.jpg </br>  Trainers, which one of these Pokémon evolves into Seviper?  <br>Did they serious say that?</br>  <br> Suicune <br>Holy crispy shit.</br></br>  OK, Trainers!

It would be a long and boring battle, for sure. But Forretress would come out ahead due to insane defense. Besides, if all else fails he has explosion which is a guaranteed tie.<br><br>Seviper is fucked. Minun is really the only thing that could fuck up Forretress, but most Forretress carry EQ so he'll be fucked anyway.<br><br>TL;DR all of those 3 are fucked.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Seviper, the thing is more likely to have Volt Switch than EQ</br>  <br> Besides, if all else fails he has explosion which is a guaranteed tie. <br>Tecnically, if a Pokémon uses explosion or self-destruct it counts as a win for the other Pokémon since the user's health is the first to deplete.</br></br>  <br>Meta has shifted more towards cutsap, which is eq/explosion. Volt switch is kind of cheating because it implies you're using another pokemon to fight. Seviper can't do shit to Forretress.<br><br><br>Gyro ball would fuck up Swellow long before Swellow could chip through 140 base defense.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess seviper with hidden power fire would have the best chance</br>  <br> HP fire Seviper <br><br>Literally what.</br></br></br>    <br>me</br>  <br> wishfulthinking.jpg </br>    <br>Two years worth of semen</br>  <br>in a video game</br>  <br>You seriously think he hasn't fucked Asua in real life too?</br>  <br>NO because SAO is poorly written shit, so they would never think of such a thing</br>  <br/>        <br>Yuu a best.</br>  <br>rip ;-;</br>  <br>How can they kiss with no lips?</br>  <br>OP here, still mad at the way author handled waitress girl.<br>At least mc fucked her.</br></br>    <br><br>No he didn't.

He's got a huge harem, gotta get laid sometime in your life.</br>  I'm surprised there isn't more Juicy Yuuji here. He is the harem MC that got laid the most iirc  Despite being the "Virgin Boy Seiyuu," Hiro Shimono's characters seem to get laid a lot.  so many posts. so few suggestions  <br>and by the end of it, it was his sister he was thrusting away with. I would consider my day fulfilled</br>  <br>He penetrated her?</br>  Funnily enough, he got laid BEFORE any other girls popped into his life  He's a harem mc who canonically gets laid.

Just read  (fap to)  the manga.</br>  Looks like a season of sol and ecchi. I'm not complaining but nothing to get excited about before watching the first ep.  <br>the one with kirito VA as MC</br>  <br>The guy with the black hair and the futuristic sword surrounded by boring cute girls that are inevitably going to have cookie cutter personalities.<br><br>It looks like some shitty IS rip-off.

It still had light beams. The manga at least has loli tits.</br>  <br>GATE is shitty nationalistic nip pandering, Overlord is the same old MMO bullshit with a spooky gimmick, I saw the Chaos Dragon pre-screening and it was shit, and Rokka is just a shitty mystery with unlikable characters.<br>They're all shit.</br></br>  <br> Chaos Dragon <br>With that girly faggot shota? I don't think so.</br></br>    <br> nationalistic nip pandering <br>When will they learn?</br></br>  <br>Gatchaman is the only thing I know I'll watch for sure. Gangsta also looks interesting. Might give Ranpo Kitan a look. I'll watch Non Non Biyori and Durarara if I ever get around to finishing the previous seasons.

Duh.</br>  <br>Apparently selecting any of the shows that aren't just blatant fan service moeshit makes you underage now.

Picking up everything except for the fujoshit, yaoishit, kids toy advertisements, and Dragon Ball.<br><br>Still a lot.

Almost everything else on there is just moeshit or fanservice shows for the nth time that just gets boring after watch that shit for years. Might as well try other stuff that might break the unending tide of moeshit like Mr.bones wild ride</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, DB is a kids show, I don't claim myself to be a mature man, but that shit is just infantile and really offers nothing for me.</br>  <br>There are hardly even "moeshit" shows, not to mention using moeshit is retarded in the first place, as they are the sole thing anime excels in.<br>There are much more shounen shit than "moeshit", and really the latter is at least aimed at adult males, however fucked up they are.</br></br>  <br>Honestly, I'm tired of anything involving zombies since it's been done to death, revived and then killed again.<br><br>Also I'm thinking of picking up Wooser, but not sure.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, because fantasy LN adaptations are going to break the unending tide of bullshit.</br>  <br>moe is the cancer ruining /a/ shitting up unrelated threads with their moe garbage.</br>  <br>Because for the same reason I didn't pick up Sailor Moon when it aired a few seasons ago, they're pass their prime and have no right to be brought back from their respective graves.</br>  <br>Stop buzzword posting, and write like you don't intend to shitpost.<br>"Moe" is the best thing anime has to offer.</br></br>  <br>I watched the first two seasons of Wooser and I could count the number of times I laughed on one hand.<br>Nip humor I guess.<br><br><br> I only watch mature anime for mature gentlemen like myself. <br>Go away.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh boy here we go</br></br>  <br> same old MMO bullshit <br>Except that there is only one player in the main story (so far) and that not only is he overpowered as fuck (as are his minions), but also doesn't give a shit about killing?</br></br>    <br><br>Moe is shit and you guys know it is killing anime.</br></br>  <br>You can try harder than that, anon.</br>  <br>I'd rather take fantasy LN adaptations than "oh no! senpai saw my panties" again.<br><br><br>Quite the opposite, if it has kept going like this for the past 10 or so years, then it obviously is working for them.

Only a few anime are worth watching, 90% is generic school setting / cute girls shit.<br><br>Charlotte is an oddball, it could be good but who knows.<br><br>Aquarion is the only good anime of the season, from what I can tell. Chaos dragon could be OK.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aquarion reeks of trainwreck (and not the good kind).</br>  <br> It has cute girls therefore it's bad. <br>Who invited /v/?</br></br>  <br>Previous season as awesome.<br><br><br>Keyword being generic. Literally every scene in those types of shows has been done a million times. It feels like you're watching the same thing over and over. Another accidental boob grab, another insert MC, another token tsundere. Shit gets old when you've seen a lot of anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Aquarion is the only good anime of the season <br><br>Comedy gold.</br></br></br>  <br>It's looking to be, unless you count continuing shows like Arslan. There are always a few surprises, though. Nothing really stands out at the moment. Again, 90% generic cute girl / school setting and of course another stuck in an MMO.</br>  <br>While cute girls aren't necessarily bad, the fact that we get a dozen of that shit season after season after season is bad. I don't understand how you faggots can just eat that shit up.</br>   Gonzo is still alive   <br> boob grab, another insert MC, another token tsundere <br>That doesn't sound like CGDGT to me.<br>I'll agree with you on school-setting romcom harem shit though.

That was easy. Perhaps I should do that more often. <br>It's slightly more efficient than dueling everybody.</br>  <br>Hey, some of these are legit great.</br>  <br> it's a commentary on how even though Security seems to hold power over the prisoners, at base they are both poor of good cards <br> Just a stick gives you cruelty and tells you that you're superior to others <br>It's all educational in the end.</br></br></br>  <br> Commander Gottoms, Swordsman is considered a rare card <br> Yaiba owns TWO copies of Synchro Gottoms <br>Is Commander Gottoms of higher rarity or what</br></br></br>  If only people realized they could physically get rid of their problems  <br>What the fuck kind of stream quality bullshit is that?</br>  .  <br>Rape is defined through lack of consent, not physical resistance.<br><br>Because our culture views sex as a form of dominance by the "active" side on the "passive" side, it's considered bad when it's done to someone without consent (which also automatically makes them the "passive" side).<br><br>Your definition of rape would only apply in a truly sexually liberated culture where sex is not a form of dominance. I'm not sure if such a culture exists in the large-scale at present.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, it's like you think the average person is stupid or some shit. A lot of us here are people with actual careers outside of shitposting in 4chan. In the outside world, we can't joke about these things because whiny people like you are the majority. In this small section if the internet, WE are the majority. We laugh at whatever we want to laugh. If you want a website that is more like the outside world, then you should go to tumblr.<br>And stop comparing your disorder, to actual rape</br></br>  <br>So you feel oppressed in real life and this board is your hugbox?<br><br>Talk about tumblr.</br></br></br>  <br>She consented when she inhaled that chloroform. She knew full well what's going to happen after.</br>  <br><br>it's not rape they are just conquering her</br></br>  What other entertainment media can get away with shoddy writing to the extent that anime regularly does?<br><br>Have you ever stopped and considered just how much money it takes to produce your average anime episode? We're talking like $100 a second, on the low end.<br><br>So, with that kind of money on the line, why is the writing often so poor? Even in popular, mainstream anime produced by large studios, plot developments can be completely erratic and nonsensical. Take Mirai Nikki: $130 a second. $70,000 an episode, yet they can't just sit down and make a coherent storyboard?<br><br>Why?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying that seriousness is a main factor of good writing. </br>  <br> &gt;It can be said that one work is objectively inferior to another. <br> Actually it can't that's the problem. <br><br>It can, and it's quite a simple concept. For example, a story that is not written is an objectively lesser story than one that is.<br><br> What do you mean function? Like entertainment value? Because that's is completely subjective. <br>Entertainment value would be a subjective function. The quality of that entertainment would be objective.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It really depends on what they're going for. If emotion, and expression in a character are important to the studio, a simple gesture of arms being raised could take a while. You have to keep in mind, that not only do they animate the linework, but the color pallete/shading as well. <br><br>I've tried my hand at animating too, and I can say it is a hair-pulling process that can take up so much of your time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some of those were decent, but shit like Thor 2 and Iron Man 3 made me give up on capeshit. Now they are rental only and I only watch them while drunk.</br>  <br>Just realized but didn't Anno just say "I chose it because it sounds complicated" because he didn't want to have to explain himself to a group of fucking children</br></blockquote>]
