Can't we have a thread without the usual faggotry? It's just the same posts and a race to the image limit. It's not fun.  <br>You're retarded, anon<br><br>Then pick a fucking random episode of YrYr and discuss every details of it here. Convince the anons of this thread to watch the same episode and discuss it.<br><br><br>Fuck you</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Don't say that too loud.<br>It can be helped, when there's nothing to talk about you simply don't talk.</br></br>  <br>I-It's not like I like you or anything, b-baka.</br>  <br>Dont worry, I know deep inside you also have a crave for a hug.</br>  <br>i haven't been hugged in years. when will a pretty girl hug me?</br>  <br>T-thats sad, Anon.<br>Don't worry, neither have I.</br></br>  I have just gotten inti Yuru Yuri.

Chinatsu a reincarnation of Satan.</br></br>  <br>Not that anon, but I just started watching it too.

How can she be a reincarnation of Satan if Satan is not dead? Also, Satan is neither a cute nor an innocent while China is both. That doesn't match at all.</br>  <br><br>That Anon probably just hates Chitose. She is a good character, just not quite one of the best.</br></br>  <br>Some people are allergic to shippingfags.</br>  <br>Can't speak for everyone, but I hated Chitose when I first watched it, she came out of nowhere and took over every scene.</br>  <br>I-if it helps i also like kyoko</br>  <br>Excellent taste! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.<br><br>Kill yourself</br></br></br>  <br><br> evil person did nothing wrong <br><br>I love this meme</br></br></br></br>  <br>She also looks like a granny with that hair color and haircut.</br>  <br> China is evil <br><br>Even better meme, anon. You must be a pretty epik memer.<br><br>Seriously, Akari and China are best buddies and constantly hang out and clearly enjoy each other's company. If China was really the monstrous rapist you people meme about, wouldn't Akari be less fond of her?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Keep smack-talking her, Ayano. She'll remember that when Kyouko and Yui start dating and you try to come back to Chitose as a backup plan. She will drink the delicious tears falling from your eyes, then leave you in a pool of misery. <br><br>But go ahead. Keep making fun of the only friend you've ever had.</br></br></br></br>  <br>if you can't even spell her name right you might aswell just leave</br>  <br>Great! It's a start.</br>  <br><br>Stop trying to corrupt his mind, liking anybody but Yui is intolerable and disgusting.</br></br>  <br>Let's be fair, I think the Coalgirls release uses Kyoko, and that's the most well-known one. Most images of season one you see out there use those subs.</br>  <br><br> liking anybody but my favorite character is intolerable and disgusting <br><br>Fight me, fgt.</br></br></br></br>  <br> liking anybody but Yui is intolerable and disgusting. <br> not wanting these smiles to be protected <br>I don't understand you at all</br></br></br>  <br><br>Stockholm Syndrome, dude. Stockholm Syndrome.</br></br>  <br>Yuifags, everyone.</br>  <br>I fucking will nerd</br>  <br>I was drunk and sad at a wedding and you kept me laughing and thinking about Akari 'ehehe'ing at donuts during dinner. Thank you anon.</br>  <br> generalizing that much <br>Every group has its extremists.</br></br>  <br>Glad to be of help anon.</br>  We need that image of a rock hitting China to clear up some of the unjustified China hate going on  <br><br> unjustified </br></br>  <br><br> unjustified China hate </br></br>  <br><br>Who could ever hate a stalker?</br></br>    <br><br>Kyouko is such a slut.  Just one of the reasons why I love her. </br></br>    <br><br>China is morally ambiguous, due mostly in part to her social retardation, and that's part of why I enjoy her character so much. It's not like Namori is blind to this fact, in fact she revels in it and loves pulling out that particular side of her character when the viewer/reader least expects it. In a genre full of good girls, China is pretty refreshing for me.<br><br>Even if their relationship is essentially Stockholm Syndrome, I think it's developing slowly into something incredibly cute. I know it's Namori, and YRYR doesn't exactly like to advance the plot, but I will have a heartgasm the day China finally realizes it's Akari she loves and she only creeps on Yui because of her obsession with idealistic princess/prince romance. Chapter 100 is coming up, who knows? Maybe something crazy will happen.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't worry, Yui. She loves you too.</br></br>  <br>Kyouko puts out all the time.</br>  <br><br>One day she will add all the Amusement Club and Student Council to her harem, as she drags them around on lesbian adventures.<br><br> Akari still won't get any though. </br></br></br></br>    <br>Obviously, who couldn't love her?</br>  <br><br>N-Nande?</br></br>  <br>Akari is a good girl.</br>  <br>The harem is Ayano's.</br>  <br>inappropriate</br>  <br>In the short interludes in the episodes where two yurus are running and their name is in the background, Kyouko is clearly spelled 'Kyouko'. Not that I care but yeah.</br>  Do the girls in this show age? What happens when the little girls are no longer little girls?  <br>No. They're stuck in a timeloop.</br>  <br>As if Chinatsu will ever join her harem.  She and Akari will have lesbian hijinks of their own. </br>  <br>B-but Kyouko x Akari is my OTP.</br>  <br>Holy mother of Godoka Akari is best girl.</br>  Soooo, did yui confess to kyouko already?  <br>I don't know what you're talking about, but Yui isn't gay if that's what you mean.</br>  <br>Yui'd only confess to Ayano if anything.</br>    <br>I believe some form of validation is in order.</br>  <br>Have you ever see her pursue another girl romantically or sexually?</br>  <br><br>When has Yui shown sexual interest in a man? Don't jump to conclusions if you don't have proof.</br></br>  <br><br>Same artist who drew...</br></br>  Time for some different pairings<br><br>Yui x Ayano<br>Kyoko x Chinatsu<br>Akari x Chitrose</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Yui x Ayano <br><br>Not too much different. There has been a couple posts of them on and off.<br><br> Kyouko x Chinatsu <br><br>Surprised I don't see more of this in these threads, to be honest.<br><br> Akari x Chitose <br><br>I can get behind this. But Akari may be giving in to Stockholm Symdrome with Chinatsu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> different <br>Those are more than common, you dolt.</br></br>  <br>Well, by those standards, is she asexual?</br>  <br>what the fuck is a dolt</br>  <br><br>Not that poster, but they may have just meant "different" for these threads? I would think,  if one has watched both seasons through to the end , they would be aware of these as potential pairings.</br></br>  <br>What you are</br>  <br><br>No clue, but I'm just saying we have no proof of what her sexuality is. She hasn't shown any strong feelings towards one specific gender.<br><br>Asexual, though? Eeehhh, until proven otherwise, maybe. Her one and only love, at this point, is  video games and puns. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Pretty much a "baka".

It's bedtime for all the good little kiddies.</br>  <br> Narutards calling people kids <br><br>What kind of bizzaro world did I enter?</br></br></br>  I'm thankful to OP for this.

There is no escape.<br>You will become one of the Zetsu.

Going without sex for centuries must have been miserable for her.</br>  <br> New movie in a week <br> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr> </br></br>  <br>Name a single thing.</br>  <br>Not him, but Nardo tried to do a kage bunshin in the scene in the pic he replied to.<br>I'd say it's less of a retcon and more Kishi/SP not remembering shit, but what can you do.</br></br>  <br>She'll probably throw herself off Mt. Fuji wearing a tutu or some shit.</br>  <br>What did it retcon? Not trying to start shit im genuinely curious</br>  <br>Who the fuck ties a scarf like that kid with the purple one?</br>  <br>His mother, obviously.</br>  Does it have the Nurutu image song?  <br>In this movie Naruto makes two tiny clones and in the start of the series he says that the kage bushin is his worst jutsu and did one dead clone so i guess it makes sense</br>  <br>Why is Shikkimaru in the poster?</br>  <br>And is the guy below Kakachi Saskay or secret Zai?</br>   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=UU<wbr>AGW_e13wM</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>Is Bolt using gentle fist in this PV? It would be nice if he learned or inherited SOMETHING from his mother.</br></br>  <br>Certainly looks like it. Open palm has been Gentle Fist-specific since the chuunin exams.</br>  <br>The bunshin no jutsu was his worst jutsu (without the kage), he didn't know the existence of the kage bunshin no jutsu prior to the first chapter of the manga.</br>  <br>He didn't know about the multiple shadowclone. He might've known about the regular one.</br>  <br>Why is Sasuke in the poster?</br>  <br>Foreshadowing the fact that he becomes Naruto's secretary, or just some other bullshit.</br>  <br>Writer's pet. Not even joking, he's one his favourite chars.</br>  <br>On the team with Sakura, Sai, and Naruto<br><br>He prints money.</br></br></br>  <br>Eat your burrito, anon.</br>  <br> Is Bolt using gentle fist in this PV? <br>I don't know what else it could be.</br></br>  English subs are kind of shit, but I guess that's all I have for now  <br>So did Boruto decide to learn Gentle Fist over Frog Kata because Hinata mentioned that you can make a man's heart explode in a single touch with it?</br>  <br>The shadow clones are supposed to be some elite technique because rather than a cheap illusion they have a physical form and can get shit done.<br>Zabuza is a living legend and he could make two, three water clones, for instance.<br>I miss the lower power levels of the early series.</br></br></br>  <br>Who cares it was very simple to begin with, so changing a few things is actually an improvement to add to "IÂ´m alone and everyone hates me"</br>  <br>Does the fight with Shikadai happen before or after Boruto's training with Sauce?<br><br>I only see three possible scenarios:<br> Bort needs training from the two ninja Gods to be able to beat a lazy half sandnigger <br> Bort loses so he goes to Sauce to gets stronger <br> Bort wins but he doesn't get promoted because he doesn't believe in the power of friendship so he gets butthurt and decides to get more power. </br></br></br></br></br></br>   There's a new Junko interview where she talks about her work on The Last and Boruto. Apparently Himawari plays a decent-sized roll. It's in moon though. <br>http://natalie.mu/comic/pp/naruto<br><br> &gt;1) firstly she says, that she felt like the new movie was a huge responsibility for her, because theyâre all grown up. She also mentioned that all Naruto/Boruto feelings will be expressed through the participation of Himawari. <br> 2)she says that the shinobi world has changed a lot. Especially in terms of technological development. She thinks Naruto has a personal laptop, so he can spy on everyone through Internet and itâs also a representation of people who live behind the Hokage rock <br> 3) she mentioned that she felt really happy and overwhelmed for Naruto and Hinata, especially in the wedding scene. But she couldnât have imagined that Naruto will be with Hinata(in this particular movie) she thought he would stay single a little longer.  <br> 4) she says that she was waiting for Sakura to be hokage.  <br> 5) she talks about Hinatas wedding kimono and says that it was a great decision to make her wear the elegant kimono, and for Naruto to wear the konoha-style smoking. <br> 6) itâs really funny for her that she voices both 17 - years old Naruto and older one. </br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br>   <br>He already knew about it said it was his worst skill</br>  <br>Naruto and Kabuto are the only people alive capable of using it and he's too busy to teach it/doesn't think Bolt is quite ready for that power level.</br>  <br>Or because he wants to be spiteful towards his daddy.</br>  <br> over Frog Kata <br>He hasn't learned Sage Mode.  Yet. </br></br>  <br>That's Sai.</br>  So does is it subbed or do I have to look for those too? are there even any good subs out there for this movie?  <br> 4) she says that she was waiting for Sakura to be hokage. <br>is she retarded?</br></br>  <br>   <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;4 ) she says that she was waiting for Sakura to be hokage.</br> <br><br>But don't hokages have to do SOMETHING to even be considered?</br></br></br>   I enjoyed this movie.   <br>Sausage is supposed to pick up on the fact that Bort is a disrespectful, cheeky little shit to his father, so he decides to train him and set the kid straight. Bort meanwhile wants to surpass his father, so turning to his greatest rival and fellow living god is a fairly good place to start.<br>He probably already knew the Air Palm/Gentle Fist. I'd be very much surprised if we actually got a training sequence or flashback with Hinata.<br><br>Given that we know what the structure of the exams is, it's safe to bet that the training takes place between stages 2 and 3. We've seen Bolt yelling at his father and storming out of his office angrily, so I suppose it could go<br> stage 1 and 2 <br> Bolt asks Nardo to train him for Stage 3 <br> he can't, kid gets butthurt, Sausage is about to drop a report and sees his attitude <br> decides to train him, shenanigans ensue <br> Shikamaru Jr is saved by the impending moon invasion </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is the Bunshin no jutsu, it's very different compared to Kage Bunshin, even the seals are different, in the movie he pretend to do the kage bunshin no jutsu and this is impossible when he was a kid</br>  <br>Well at least try it</br>  <br>The Pancake torrent has better subs</br>  <br>is that one still a cam rip?</br>  <br> Sage Mode Frog Kata/Gentle Fist Hybrid <br>Jesus Christ.</br></br>  <br>Nope. HQ rip (and its actually the japanese version)</br>  <br>how is the video quality? considering that is only 483mb?</br>  <br>shit, thanks its better than before</br>  <br>not downloading it</br>  <br>No it's the new one just lower quality. Still a decent quality actually. The subs sometimes have grammatical errors and I noticed a mistranslation in the confession but otherwise they're good enough until the high quality fansubs come out.</br>  <br> One touch and the victim turns to sone </br>  <br>looks horrible anon</br>  <br><br> Victim's heart turns to stone <br><br>I know there's a pun in this somewhere</br></br></br></br>  <br>looks like shit</br>  <br>For 483 MB it's decent.</br>  Does somebody knows what the fuck the Drama CD is about?  <br>This is pretty much the same quality as the HD. Nah, I'll skip.</br>  <br>NH wedding maybe?</br>  <br>Fucking finally.</br>  Why is the chinese hardsubbed and where are the english subs?  <br>The chinese isn't hardsubbed</br>  <br>Then why the fuck can't I remove it/choose another sub?</br>  <br>do you think they waited until marriage or he invited her too taste his ramen when they came back from the moon?</br>  <br>Don't know anon, but I changed mine with the XYsubfilter settings</br>   4) she says that she was waiting for Sakura to be hokage.   <br> Disc 3: Original Drama CD THE HOST -NARUTO THE CD- <br>Wonder what it could be.</br></br>   &gt;Ninja battle in space ripped the moon in half <br>Bravo Kishi, simply epic.</br>  Just finished watching. It's HD quality and the subs are alright, though they have some mistranslations and lines that are not subbed. Nothing that actually bothered me.<br><br>Also this movie is great. I loved it and I don't even care how cliche and simple it is. The best thing to come out of this shitfest, really.</br></br>  <br>At least ninjas didn't have to use their energy weapon to pulverize moon  ;) </br>  <br>This was a great idea.</br>  <br>Wasn't Kaguya trapped inside there?</br>  <br> The Beam moved at ten thousand times the speed of sound. that is like Mach 10000 </br>   The Last was pretty good <br> Gaiden was decent with a disappointing climax <br> Boruto on the horizon looking better with each trailer and article <br>Are we entering a golden age of nardo, /a/? Just as it's all about to end?</br></br></br>  <br>The reason the movie is great is because it gives us "cliched" things that we never get to see in any anime at all. When was the last time you saw<br><br> hero rescuing his damsel-in-distress love interest from an NTR villain <br> princess carry and hand-holding as the characters see images of their past float by <br> passionate, 12-second kiss while the hero cups her face <br> wedding montage <br> children and family life scene <br><br>Nevermind that this is Naruto; just as an anime film, it's one of the fluffiest ever made.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they can breathe on the moon <br> the place has normal gravity <br> no one dies due to getting blasted with radiation </br></br></br>  <br> 4) she says that she was waiting for Sakura to be hokage. <br><br>Dreams are free, Junko.</br></br></br>  I love Naruto threads and I love how paranoic /a/ is with it. Always get some got laughs outta these  <br>And people were saying that Boruto didn't get shit from his mother.</br>  <br> Naruto Z </br>  <br>   4) she says that she was waiting for Sakura to be hokage.  </br>  <br> About to end <br><br>I honestly doubt that this will ever happen. Though I'd rather see it ending with a sad tone rather than once again wish for it to just get over with</br></br></br>  <br>They got married in less than a year after they returned from the moon, apparently. Either way, they didn't have to wait for too long.</br>  <br>If the Bolt movie is successful, there will be a series focused on the new gen for sure. This is SP's biggest money maker right now.</br>  <br>That really made me happy, actually. I wouldn't have minded if they had gotten married even younger. They have a lifetime of pent up frustration to deal with.</br>  <br>   4) she says that she was waiting for Sakura to be hokage.  <br>Nobody can be this retarded, Im sure there is a [laughs.] in between there someone where.</br></br>  Does anyone know why does that pair of retards keep spamming every naruto thread?  <br>Too much free time I'm guessing.</br>  Also the character songs (there's one from Hinata and one from Naruto) and the drama CD:<br><br>http://www.sendspace.com/filegroup/<wbr>FbR0rPJ25ozqyU0vSurSjQ</wbr></br></br>  <br>It's just the fluffiest, most cliched, happiest romance between the hyperactive MC and the shy big-boobed dark-haired girl who's been pining for the MC forever.<br><br>Thank god Kishi stuck to his guns and have all the drama come from other families (Uchiha) or their predecessors (Boruto) instead of between the two of them.</br></br></br>  You guys are late. I already saw it at the theater.  <br>Of course we're late. We had a terrible Aussie camrip too and a shitty Korean one. <br><br>Did you like it?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Pretty much <br><br>The weeaboo screams at the 'oh I love you Hinata' scene did ruin the movie.</br></br></br></br>  <br> a terrible Aussie camrip too <br>Why aren't there any Americans who'd make camrips? The movie also airs in America.<br><br>Are Naruto fans in Australia better/worse than American fans?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Brazilians theaters are shit and they only released the shitty brazilian dub. I'd rather wait the remaining two months and watch the decent version in the comfort of my couch.</br>  <br> paying real money to see nurududududu <br>I hope none of you did this.</br></br>  <br>Hey, fagtron, are you going to rip the Burrito movie for us too? It's coming out in Australia, isn't it? <br><br>And please this time keep the vibrator out of your ass.</br></br></br>  <br>Why not? The movie was actually decent compared to the pile of shit most of shippuden was.</br>  <br>Naaah, Boruto doesn't interest me that much, besides, I'm not risking my visa again.<br><br> keep the vibrator out of your ass <br>No to this one as well</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ending?<br><br>Chapter 700 was perfect to end it.<br><br>Even the fucking last.<br><br>There was no fucking need to create brand new character designs and plots if they didn't plan for it to be a new season.<br><br>No this shit right here is a testing grounds for Nurudu GT handed off to someone other than kishi.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But anon-kun, if nobody went to see the movie, how would we have gotten our rip?</br>  <br>I don't think Naruto is ending any time soon after Boruto, remember that there is still an army of aliens waiting, plus the romance with Sarada and Studio Pierrot isn't letting this go.</br>  <br>Shame. We'll have to rely on some other anon from the shitpost capital then.</br>   Boruto isn't blushing from Sarada <br> He's blushing from Mitsuki's whispering on his ear </br>  <br>Gotta admit Naruto is very shitty , had potential but terrible excecution. This new generation seems somewhat interesting though.</br>  <br> tumblr  <br> that quality <br>Step it the fuck up, senpai.</br></br></br>  <br><br>FYI he's not blushing because he likes her.<br><br>She said "let's show them how awesome we are."<br><br>It seems Bolt here doesn't know how to react to flattery.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Kishi is already ruining the new gen. It needs to be handed off to another writer unless you want to be fed more shit.</br></br>  /a/ is fucking dead.<br><br>The normalfags,casual pleb and /v/ took over. Where can I go if I want to discuss anime with lolicon and moe lover?</br></br>  <br>Nah, he is the tsundere spaghetti type.</br>  <br><br>You sound like a broken record newfag. You will continue to stay here forever leeching off nurudu threads since you have nothing better to do.</br></br>  <br> FYI he's not blushing because he likes her <br> Salad and Bort fight a lot <br> Salad compliments Bort which is something he's not used to <br> Bort blushes <br>He likes her. He's even doing that thing with his eyes Uzumaki do when they want to bone someone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just want more Himawari, that's enough for me. Hope Kishi makes her more relevant.<br><br>Why would anyone visit /v/ anyways?</br></br></br>  <br>It could be but he freaks out the moment he see's mitsuki like every shonen Mc character who is staring and blushing for a girl</br>  <br>No, she was trapped in another dimension.</br>  <br> young blond hothead <br> one of the shortest members of the cast <br> has a younger sibling he treasures <br> daddy issues </br></br></br></br>  <br>/a/ is tsundere for Naruto.<br><br>It went almost full dere on October-December 2014.</br></br></br>    <br>You're being ridiculous. First off, we don't even know if she says that line during that scene; it was just a voice over. Secondly, she's right in his face when he blushes, so it's obvious he's reacting to that. It's driven home even more by how he freaks out when he notices Mitsuki watching.</br>  <br>Plus there aren't really any other ship options for Boruto. The only other girl his age is Chocho and they don't really seem to have any opinion on each other.</br>  good release when tbh  <br>There's  Himawari .</br>  can i watch this if i only watch the anime and dont read manga  <br> It's driven home even more by how he freaks out when he notices Mitsuki watching <br>Does Mitsuki like to watch?</br></br>  <br>Guess who is Himawari seiiyu.</br>  <br>Imouto route is best route.</br>  Just a question. Shouldn't Amegakure fall into a huge ass sectarian war after Nagato died?  <br>They'll introduce a minor character who hides in the background but has been crushing on Boruto for a while.<br><br>Boruto, in an attempt to surpass his father, decides not to go this route.</br></br></br>  <br>You don't read the manga? How did you make it this far wacthing that horrible animation?</br>  <br>They're still on /a/ you fucking retard</br>  <br>And the fillers. Oh God the fillers. <br><br><br>One of the things I like about this is that it's Bort who pursues Salad instead of the other way around.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They probably folded into the nearest nation willing to take them. I think they were next to Iwa</br>  <br>  handed off to someone other than kishi <br>YOU SAY THAT LIKE IT'S A BAD THING!</br></br>  <br>I just dont read much manga. I started out watching the anime and its what I've stuck with, I just skip all the fillers.</br>  <br>Sure. They don't really address the end of the war much.</br>  <br>It'll be handed to the younger Kishi so it'll finally die off from the lack of both popularity and quality.</br>  I want to marry Hinata!  Just finished watching the film. Was okay, i guess~  <br>But that would mean we'd have to sit though the edgiest shit yet before it did</br>  <br>Were you expecting a well-written action film? The entire plot is just a veil to frame the cute romance behind.</br>   Everyone even Ichiraku Ramen guy went to the wedding. <br> Everyone except muh best friend. <br>Why I'm not surprised.</br></br>  <br>No it doesn't, you idiots just get your panties in such a wad that shitposters come crawling out of the woodwork to rile you up. It's been going on for almost 6 years now, fucking figure it out already you gigantic morons.</br>  Guys, what's the name of that song that plays in the beginning when Jiraiya is narrating? I know it's an old folklore song but I can't remember the fucking name  <br> Were you expecting a well-written action film? <br>Nah. Most of naruto is just talking. I didn't like that part midway through where they flashbacked to choji saying meat should fall from the sky three times, reminds me of all the flashbacks that made me stop watching shippuden</br></br>  <br>It's heavily debatable whether he attended the conception of his own daughter, of course he would not show up.<br>Also with redemption and all I'd like to think that the faggot actively decided to make his contribution to the happiness of the event by sparing it his presence.</br></br>  <br>...Greensleeves?</br>    <br><br>Fucking hell, thanks anon. I feel like an idiot.</br></br>  <br>Sasuke not showing up is his gift to the world.</br>  <br>Keikaku doori</br>  Naruto is epic.  <br>That's what makes the wedding so good, no Sasuke.</br>  <br>It's really weird hearing it there. I suppose they want to emphasize Kaguya and her ilk being aliens/outsiders, so they went for the single most European song of a similar, feudalist period they could think of.</br>  New episode tomorrow or is it still on break?   all versions of the movie are out of stock for 2 weeks <br><br>BASED<br>A<br>S<br>E<br>D</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>based guy returns tomorrow. prepare you anos</br></br>  <br>I hope SP do some Last era episodes just so we can get more Hanabi.<br>She deserves some opportunities to shine, and barely got any in The Last.</br></br>  <br>Nah it's just that boruto inherited the love for uchiha from his father</br>  I still can't believe this went from one of the most hated thing on /a/ to one of the loved.<br><br>Too bad its pretty much over unless Kishimoto make something else after the movie.<br><br>I kinda want to see /a/ cry a bit longer  tbh </br></br></br></br>  <br>He was there. She gave birth in Ninja Mengele's basement of wonders. Probably next to the aborted Sharingan tentacle fetus in a jar.</br>  <br>You would think, being on /a/, you'd be used to seeing tsundere switch from its tsun to its dere phase.</br>  Prison School  <br> ending on any chapter that isn't 81 <br>Huh?<br> For some reason I was thinking that we were getting 13 episodes, not 14, so it may just be that I'm completely retarded. </br></br></br>  <br>so novel&gt; manga&gt; anime?<br>worth reading?</br></br>  <br>There's only a manga and an anime, anon.<br>But yes, I took the manga &gt; anime route and I'm enjoying the anime more than I would otherwise</br></br>  <br>alright, thank you kind sir.</br>  <br>My middle school (or whatever you go to when you're 14) had a free day for all the kids to have fun. One part of the event was throwing water balloons at each other.<br><br>I didn't go. Fuck I was retarded.

That is, if they didn't fucking tone down and censor the rest of the 5% that actually has some sort of interesting premise. Hell, why not turn the MC and his soldiers into fucking high-schoolers while you're at it... If you moeify, censor and remove any adult &amp; mature themes, you might as well adapt another fucking Light/Visual novel aimed at beta faggots. There are thousands of those out there, go make animes out of those instead of showing us this butchered crap.<br><br>Remove the gore, violence any sort, nudity or any sort of mature themes, and the series suddenly looses any appeal it had from the start. What's Berserk, Gungrave or say Black Lagoon without it's graphic violence and devoid of any mature and explicit content whatsoever? Fucking boring and pointless! Might as well watch swordshit moe online instead, because the difference is suddenly minimal.</br></br></br></br>  lol   Why is my children's cartoon not like the source. <br><br>You can't get more autistic than this.</br></br>  <br> animes </br>  <br>Overlord isn't pulling many punches.</br>  just watch Overlord for your graphic deaths this season.  <br><br>Overlord overmind.</br></br>  What exactly is being censored here?  <br> animes <br><br><br><br>If only Madhouse had done Gate.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rape murders</br>  <br> no bloody rori introduction </br>  <br> animes <br> le wrong generation of anime <br> mature themes for mature anime watchers such as myself <br>SAGE SAGE SAGE<br> also dubs </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This would be on /a/'s hate list if it wasn't aired on summer.<br>Instead we got underageb&amp; faggots sperging all over it.</br></br>  <br> animes <br/></br>  <br>People forget that Ishihara's old-peoples party passed a bunch of anti-obscenity laws in the last few years, both at the Tokyo level and at the national level. And since anime and manga are primarily produced in Tokyo, they are bound by those laws.</br>  <br>Disgusting.<br><br>Thank Abe-san for censorship</br></br></br>  <br>Wow, you're so mature m8.</br>  <br>Only Godani can save us now.</br>  <br>Rory's introduction is censored which actually takes away some of her character background. Go read chapter 4 of the manga.</br>  <br>animeys</br>  <br>Say goodbye to doujins, m8</br>  <br>You could have done this in the actual gate thread </br>  Please. Keep it wrapped up in 3 sentences  <br>then op do the following<br><br>A) read the manga for gore<br>B) actually watch it for the plot<br>C) watch something R rated<br><br>To me the lack of gore really doesn't take anything away from this show, it's got more than enough going for it to make it an AOTS contender</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They also cut out Tuka's flashback of her father.</br>   you might as well adapt another fucking Light/Visual novel aimed at beta faggots <br><br>like Gate?</br></br>  <br>That could happen next ep.  Though it may be put back to her PTSD arc. </br>  <br>TERRAFORMARS CENSORING WAS THE BEST</br>  <br>That's edgy as fuck though. If it had rape murders, would it be better? I don't think so. It can do fine without the rape, and the fact that it can makes the rape unnecessary.<br><br><br>If you're upset that [X anime from the 2010s] isn't like [Y anime from before the 2000s], then you're pretty fucking new and know next to nothing about anime as an industry</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure it starts with the rape murders, but when they start going after the consentual sex murders you'll be the one bitching.</br>  <br>Doesn't look like it will from the preview, but I'll hold out hope.</br>  <br> Overlord isn't pulling many punches. <br>Everything takes place in a video game, so technically it is not real. You see that one scene with a Death Knight mercilessly thrusting it's blade into that one coward knight. Begging for help by offering to pay someone to save his life. That was pretty brutal in my opinion. It is "fake" fantasy violence and gore in a medium with an already animated fictional people.

It's fucking terrible, the manga too.  I was wondering about the censoring too, since when is that, and does that means School live is not worth watching because everything will be cencored  <br> Everything takes place in a video game <br>Do you not understand the concept of the show?

They cut down on the amount of blood by so much, that they don't even show anyone dying.<br>Instead, when a Dragon attacks a bunch of people, they just cut to a slide literally just telling you that a bunch of people died, and that's it, even though a quarter of the village died. Oh, and there's how they had so much smoke on the scene with the RPG, that some people can't even tell that the dragon's arm was blown off.<br><br>And on the very first episode, it never occurs to the watcher that thousands of Japanese died during the attack. It even becomes confusing to some to find out that the empire had most of its forces crushed in that encounter.<br><br>When the censorship is grave enough, that you can't get an idea of what's going on, there's a problem.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's gotta be an extreme ploy to get people to buy Blurays.</br>  <br> And on the very first episode, it never occurs to the watcher that thousands of Japanese died during the attack. It even becomes confusing to some to find out that the empire had most of its forces crushed in that encounter. <br>What? How would anyone miss this?</br></br>  <br>It's obvious that the force that was sent through the gate was crushed.<br>It's not obvious just how many were actually sent, though. Not until the next episode, where it has to be explained to the viewer.</br></br>   watching any anime made after 2011 <br> watching any anime made after 2011 based on a shitty manga <br> watching any anime made after 2011 based on a shitty manga made by a shit studio with little to no experience </br></br>  <br>Unless it has Shaft tier editing then the BDs for Gate won't show much more than what we currently see.</br>   Gate <br> good <br>Pick neither and then leave</br></br>  <br>Only the standing army got annihilated in Japan.<br>The emperor had his vassals also attack on the Japanese expedition base 2 times.

But it's easily assumable. <br>Besides, why does it need to be obvious? It's not as if it was ever implied the numbers were small or insignificant. And any doubt anyone might have had is cleared up up anyway. <br><br>It's honestly a non-issue. It's not like they circumvented the fact that the army was crushed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's easy to put in more blood in the BDs it's literally just red fountains of liquid.<br> shaft <br>TNK does a better job with DxD BDs than shaft.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>literally how new</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Do I fit in yet? </br>  <br>Gate is /k/ though<br>Overlord is /v/</br></br>  What was censored? <br>GATE is pandering garbage anyways</br>  <br> now days <br>Because it was totally different in the past, right?</br></br>  <br/>  <br>You have to be retarded, it's not like there's blood just missing from the current scenes, it's that they're framed in a way to exclude excessive gore. Unless they actually add length to the episode, then it won't be any different on the BD's.</br>  <br>It isn't just about the blood. It is the cut scenes that help with things like expanding characters.</br>  <br>Omedetou anon-kun! You are one of us now!</br>  <br>Ebin, simply ebin newfag-kun.<br>Repeating memes is all you can do.</br></br>  <br> It's not as if it was ever implied the numbers were small or insignificant <br>It sort of is. The anime makes it seem like maybe a hundred or so soldiers came through the gate, when it was actually many tens of thousands. Simply put, they destroyed any sense of scale regarding the attack, and it's only ever made clear after one week.<br><br>It's not a good idea to over censor something to the point that it's unclear what happened, and then pretend it's alright because you explained the events once the mood is already gone.</br></br></br></br>  <br>irony</br>  <br>I would also like 45 minutes per episode for Gate but I'm being realistic.</br>  <br>it's easy, hire the best animation studio, and pay them 2~3 million yen for a episode that conveys what you think that you think might get a profit</br>  <br>Then its easily assumable that the empire killed many civilians  and enslaved even more when retreating .<br><br><br>The irony is you telling other to go to /v/.<br>Get a trip on so I can filter you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> children's cartoon <br> airs at 24:30 </br></br>  <br> you <br><br>it's getting embarrassing autismo-kun<br><br>fuck off back to reddit /v/ MAL BL or wherever the fuck you came from</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> retreating <br>They never had a chance to retreat; they were all either killed or captured.<br> The slaves were from before the gate opened. </br></br></br>  <br> 45 minutes <br>I would as well, but they could have got the same effect by cutting 5-10 min of showing how otaku he was from the first ep, allowing them to put a few more min of the battles and the cut bits from Rory's introduction later on.</br></br>  <br>Look mangafag, the series doesn't need excessive gore in the first place. The minimum amount of blood would silence most critics, doesn't have to be HOTD style.</br>  <br>You don't need gore to show deaths from a battle. A panned out shot showing dead bodies on a warfield would establish that.</br>  <br>Huh? All I'm saying is that the BD's aren't going to add gore. I didn't imply that it's necessary in the first place.</br>  <br>gore=/=blood<br>Adding just enough blood in slashes or gunshots would suffice even in the current frames.</br></br>  <br>Full damage control mode.<br>Never expected more newfriend.<br><br><br> before the gate opened <br>Explain.  Was there a second gate? Because the one they saved clearly told them she got enslaved in the first wave. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no capitalization <br> no puntuation <br>You are the embarrassing one.</br></br></br>  <br> Everything takes place in a video game <br>You're actually that retarded or just "pretending"?</br></br>  <br>Still no sell, you'd be skipping Itami's mini character arc on how he rounded up the Ginza police force and explaining his plans of using the Imperial Palace as a fortress.<br><br>When you look at it like that, it makes sense. Newbies and animeonlyfags would change the channel.</br></br></br>  <br> A panned out shot showing dead bodies on a warfield would establish that. <br>Right, and the show doesn't even have that on these scenes.<br>They are so intent on avoiding showing anything resembling blood or a dead body.<br>They've showed some obscured dead bodies here and there, but it's really limited.<br><br><br> No, the slave they saved didn't even know about the Ginza attack. In fact, her family was killed while passing out fliers asking if someone had seen her. Hardy the god opened up the gate herself, and this basically existed as little more than an invisible portal. In the past, these portals have been opened up, which led to the diversity of species currently in the Gate world. Thing is, they only last for a while, but the Empire had magicians stabilize the gate, so they could invade. They had sent scouts months before the attack. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Go watch shameless or something. I don't think anime is for you</br>  <br>Fucking Hardy again.</br>  <br> You don't need gore to show deaths from a battle <br>Don't forget this is an anime about war(even if it focuses more on politics).<br>Without the gore scenes like the Valkyrie chopper massacre wouldn't be as effective since the point was to show how overwhelmingly powerful they are compared to the bandits attacking the city. Having a screen like  really has no kind of impact and wouldn't do it any kind of justice.<br><br><br>They already fucked up how they handled that since anime only people had no idea he was even a ranked soldier during that unlike how in the manga he actually showed his badge.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What is with /a/ and complaining about anime when it's doesn't follow the manga panel from panel or LN word from word If an anime doesn't follow the source material it's shit. When it makes minor changes so it can flow better in anime format, it's shit. When major changes are made it's shit. Then there is when the anime followed the source material to a T it's still shit. What the fuck do you want in an anime adaptation?! Why can't you guys just enjoy the anime in the same rate as the source material or better yet, don't watch the anime.</br></br>  <br>The director was trying to go for a surprise reveal but normie lack of knowledge of the military worked against it.<br><br>This anime is full of /k/ and it's understandable people see it as uninteresting.

I don't like it either.</br></br></br>  <br> Being this retarded </br>  <br> What the fuck do you want in an anime adaptation?! <br>That's the problem.

They made her shitty jap idol in slightly dark clothes with a faggy ass axe from a shonen.</br></br>  <br>Here is the thing.<br>/a/ isn't one person and some people want it to be exactly the same and some people want changes.

I like some changes either it be story or characters but I tend to enjoy both.</br>  <br> reading Gate for the gore <br> reading Gate for the violence <br> reading Gate for the nudity <br>How can you do this and still not recognize this series as the lowest-common-denominator shit that it is? It's escapism imbued with delusional Japanese jingoism, and it's target audience are ecchifag otaku who deny that any Japanese soldier ever set foot in Nanjing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I personally am more pissed off that they cut Rory's scene with the bandits, and that they completely omitted Tuka's scenes.</br>  <br> they used the LN art <br>Did they? Did you see the LN art? It's closer to the manga.</br></br>  <br>They didn't cut the bandit scene, they just shortened it because they can't show gore.</br>  Overlord &gt; Gate<br><br>Overlord = 8/10<br>Gate = 5/10 <br><br>I have spoken.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry wrong choice of words, and they've could've still showed the rest even without gore.</br>  <br>http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/i<wbr>mages/7/7e/GATE_1_Cover_Illustratio<wbr>n.jpg</wbr></wbr></br>   porn will use her inferior anime design <br>Why, she is hardly gothic anymore and its uncommon to get alot of that type</br>  <br> Everything takes place in a video game </br>  <br>is this pasta i don't know about? it's not very good.....</br>  <br>That's the novel.</br>  <br>She still looks like a goth loli, she just doesn't have the ridiculous frills.</br>  <br>Wow that looks absolutely ridiculous.

She looks like some cosplay bunny girl thing.</br>  <br>wow, you assblasted from space.</br>  <br>I don't know about that part. It's possible that the manga included a flashback earlier than it originally was, or that the anime is going to push the flashback later instead.

It's the exact same thoughts echoed in GATE threads here, just more spergy than usual.</br>  Gate should be romans getting ripped apart by swooping AH-1 Cobras in graphic detail, over-the-top Japanese nationalism, and monstergirl babes with their tits out and anything less than this is wasting my fucking time.  <br><br>You have a point but this thread is bait.

Sourcefags are absolute cancer 95% of the time.</br>  <br> I like eating shit, why do people hate it? A cup of piss? Yes please. </br>  <br>I wanted military porn and the first ep just left me with blue balls. I don't have faith that they are gonna do a 180 to their approach to the material for future episodes.</br>  <br>Hey Fuck You don't compare piss to that inferior shit.</br>  <br>If an adaptation is decent there's no point in praising it so no one touches the subject<br>himouto is airing right now and it's been excellent as an adaptation so far<br>monogatari series was fine too</br></br></br>  <br>They changed design for the sake of changing, same as with Kuribayashi and others. They could lower detailing and still stay close to original.</br>  <br><br>That is terrible. The anime version is far superior. <br><br>Overall I think the show is fun enough. It's not going to be AOTS, but it will be enjoyable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Spoken like a true pleb of shit tastes.</br>  <br>If they don't cut the Itallica scene then you'll get just that.</br>  <br>The manga design is absolutely horrible if you want to animate the clothing, if they did it realistically it'd end up covering her head every time she did a flip.</br>  <br> Wah my anime isn't full of gore, nudity, and violence as well as not being mature for a mature person such as myself. <br><br>Let me guess, you're American?</br></br></br>  <br> liking shit </br>  <br> They could lower detailing and still stay close to original. </br>  <br> anime about war <br> aren't allowed to show blood or deaths <br> somehow this is good </br></br></br>  <br>You mean like they did in the anime?</br>  <br> Any changes that mangafags don't like will still be complained about </br>  <br>I think he meant about how her dress is longer in the manga.<br>I still prefer it that way personally even if it makes her fighting look unrealistic.</br></br>  <br>I doubt they would cut the whole fucking thing but everything I saw in the first episode leads me to believe they will continue with simply cutting away from the action. <br><br>They will do shit like close-ups of the AH-1's minigun firing and then some far away shots of dudes falling over and being obscured by dust clouds you just wait. They def won't be showing any TnA either.</br></br></br>  <br>The Jpop idol look is great though.</br>  <br>I wish I still had my this is bait folder</br>  <br>I really want to see how they explain the fall of the bunny warlord kingdom</br>  <br> Liking pure edge anime </br>  <br>Never go full retard.</br>  For all the shit that Gate gets with the violence censorship, no one's praising it for having almost zero fanservice.  <br>Scenes of leering roman dudes and cowering bunny girls followed by a cutaway.</br>  <br> muh mature anime <br> why isn't my anime mature like me <br> why isn't my anime catering to adults <br>I'm convinced the only people who complain like this are the newfags who watched 20 anime and ran out of edgy popular anime to watch.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This kills my expectations, I really wanted to see the bandits get blown the fuck out.</br></br>  <br>anime is just elaborated adds for the source. <br>deal with it!</br></br>  <br>having zero fan-service should elicit the opposite of praise.</br>  <br>The fanservice doesn't really start until after the Itallica battle.</br>  <br>That's nice and allâI like the fact they didn't try to turn Tuka's nudity into fanservice or anythingâbut it's probably because it's something they're trying desperately to avoid.</br>  <br>The girls just showed up and we already got tuka waggling her ass and jiggling her tits naked.<br><br>Rory hearing a battle going on and nearly climaxing will probably last an entire episode.</br></br></br>  <br>they could have been worse. its less shitty then expected.</br>  <br>I guess this  was just added too huh.</br>  <br>It'll probably get cut.</br>  <br> lower detailing is the same as changing design completely - face, clothes, axe and everything <br>I don't think so.<br><br><br>I'm sure there's enough fighting characters in anime which had long "skirts".</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Saber wasn't that acrobatic. Saber's a tank. Rory's a bruiser.</br>  <br>Yea but what he  meant was that the dress would cover Rory's face when she did her fips.</br>  <br><br>not in america.<br><br>the less boobs you show on screen the better the anime is</br></br></br></br>  <br>That anon is saying that the anime is just a glorified commercial for the novel.</br>  <br>She's actually fairly nimble and agile. She doesn't get to showcase that much, but she's actually extraordinarily athletic. Not Lancer-class, but still easily beyond anything a human can do.</br>  <br>My bad then, I understood something completely different, guess I should go to sleep before I make more of an ass of myself.</br>  <br>Athletic doesn't always mean acrobatic.<br>You have to be athletic to fight but acrobatic to flip. It's two different things.</br></br>  <br>It's my right as an American citizen to have monstergirl titties and dragons getting blown apart by jets flying the flag of Imperial Japan goddamnit!!</br>  <br>Looking at this picture it's just hit me now that this looks almost exactly as SAO. I dunno why I didn't see it before. Sassuga A-1.</br>  <br>SAO is big. I don't blame them.</br>  <br>It's magic, I ain't gotta explain shit.</br>  The manga art sucks, get over it.  <br>The anime sucks, get over it.</br>  Hey genius, maybe the anime director wants to keep the fact she's a psycho death demigod or whatever a secret for now and reveal it later. Changing pacing is not a bad thing.  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/E1PmzgnZROo?t=1m9s<wbr></wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I suggest you read the manga if that's what you wanna see.</br>  <br>Gate had better flip animation than FSN's frame skipping. Also, it would be hell to animate Rory's frilly skirt.</br>  <br> nudity, gore and graphic violence are themes <br> nudity, gore and graphic violence are adult &amp; mature themes <br> every aspect of a work of fiction is 'pointless' except for the gore and nudity <br> the aspect of a work of fiction that makes it satisfying to adults is the nudity and gore <br><br>magnificent post. take this post and frame it and immortalize it forever. its art.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought the same and maybe they'll reveal it during the bath scene next episode.</br>  <br>Just because he can't word it correctly, doesn't mean he is wrong. Atmosphere, tone, presentation,etc is extremely important and control how a story is told and received.</br>    <br>If you took the violence out of Robocop it would be a lesser film. The over the top gore compliments the movie's tone. The same is true for Gate.</br>  <br>Anon, she can leap up skyscrapers and weave around attacks. She can pull off any acrobatics that a mere human can do.<br><br>Pulling off a quadruple somersault would be a no-brainer for her.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, yeah. And next time you say they changed Kuribayashi for easier animating too. The only problem is that she didn't have frills or flips.</br>  <br>I was referring to her fighting style. She fights more like a traditional swordsman with a few flips rather than her fighting style depending on acrobatics which Rory's is.</br>  <br>rip tomboy titty massage queen</br>  <br>That's probably the Love Live director's decision. I know the camo was simplified because easier animation.</br>  <br> She fights more like a traditional swordsman <br>I don't think that any swordsman ever fought like this </br></br>  <br>While true, explicitly showing nudity and gore is not the same thing as being mature.</br>  <br>Stop the nitpicking man you know what I meant.</br>  <br>Is she a Rhino? That face sure looks like it.</br>  <br>No, really, if you watch anime she hops and jumps and somersaults etc quite a lot. Mostly to dodge, but still.<br>Of course expecting from A-1 some real and not simplified animation would be asking too much, especially when they work on 3 shows simultaneously and even if their designers can do only SAO/Idolmaster clones, there's still quite a lot of shitty changes, like those nekomimi or axe, etc.</br></br>  <br>Are you trying to imply that fate had good animation?</br>  <br>Better than A-1.</br>  <br> boohoo where's my gory anime <br><br>I can't believe there are people who legitimately complain about this. Are you 12 years old?</br></br></br>  <br>UFOTABLE animation is literally<br> if we use every effect in sony vegas maybe they won't find out there's only two frames of animation whenever a character does something </br></br>  <br>You have to be a dumb fucking blind hater to say that A-1 has better animation when comparing this show to fate.<br><br>Yet it still has better animation.</br></br></br>  <br>Why censor the blood even in Mr. bones SAO has more gore than this shit show</br>  <br>Better than<br> if we use every effect in sony vegas maybe they won't find out there's only one frame of animation whenever a character does something even with those simple designs <br> oh, and lest change and cut a lot of everything while we at it </br></br></br>  <br>For a start, there are factors beyond the producers' control that dictate what they can and can't show. Sometimes it's what one of the TV stations does and doesn't allow, sometimes it's some law or other, occasionally just worry about how much of a stink some "won't someone please think of the children" moral guardian is likely to kick up and how much that'll cost them one way or another.<br><br>If it really bothers you that a story that "should" have the kind of sex and violence you want doesn't, and it's adapted from another medium, just go and satisfy yourself with the original. Pretend the adaptation never existed. Type Moon fans have been doing that for years with the Tsukihime anime.<br><br>All that aside, your post makes you sound like a teenager, or maybe a particularly immature and insecure early 20s. Equating explicit depictions of sex and graphic violence with maturity, the "me great alpha male, anyone not the same beta faggot" bullshit, excessive swearing, replacing parts of the title of a show you don't like with insulting terms. Being so hung up on things being mature.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was average bordering on good.<br><br><br>A-1 can be really fucking good when it wants to be, but not for GATE.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fate's animation is shit though, they're just REALLY good at visual effects.</br>  <br>You don't adapt something that has violence, gore and sex into 4kids version and expect great sales or good reviews.</br>  <br>Nice SAO webm</br>  <br>You don't get it, it's fine.</br>  <br>Then it's says a lot about A-1 if they even worse and not good with visual effects, isn't it?</br>  <br>Though there are issues with the adaptation here, I'd hardly call the GATE anime 4Kids-level.</br>  How did Gate's lack of blood turn into it not having good animation? That's just shitty bait.<br><br><br>It's got better preorder numbers than Overlord and Gangsta despite all the bitching. That should matter.</br></br></br>  <br> AOTS contender <br>Ha, Overlord/Gangsta has a better chance than Gate. No matter how many summerf/a/gs like this censored shit, it will never be AOTS. Though the only REAL contenders is Prison School and One Punch Man.</br></br>  <br> preorder </br>  <br>They even got rid of the "immoral" small girl sexualizing of Rory.</br>  <br>They didn't though, she's still a slut.</br>  <br> they didn't <br>They did, they cut out anything visual. No ass, no panties.

Not just "censored but still there" but "completely changed or cut out". Might as well air this in one block with Naruto.</br>  <br>Maybe it's just me, but I find "completely changed or cut out" less jarring than "present but completely covered by black".</br>  <br>You mean when they have enough budget to not give a fuck.</br>  <br><br>Fuck off LRD.</br></br>  <br> chicken legs <br> derpy face and general QUALITY <br> in a slow panning "service shot" <br>T-they surely wanted ViVid to succeed, right? Right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you can't refute these facts, how about you shut up?<br>I don't care about you being happy about it, they still cut out Rory fanservice. Not censor, cut out.</br></br>  <br> fucking good <br>That webm is far from fucking good you piece of shit.</br></br>  <br>It's just you. Others would wait for BD's.</br>  <br>Thanks man, here have another.</br>  <br>They showed Rory's pantsu in one of the promotional thingos.</br>  <br>Illustrations != anime.<br>If anything, it just puts a bigger contrast to show how apologetic faggots they are when it comes to small girls  as always </br></br>  <br>Jesus Christ, this anime is really attracting all the plebs<br><br> WAA WAA WHY ISN'T THERE EXCESSIVE GORE  <br> WAA WAA WHY ISN'T THERE PANTY SHOTS IN EVERY SCENE </br></br></br></br>  <br>Did Kirito get turned into a girl again?</br>  <br> implying plot matters more than any of those <br>Go watch a fucking good book you pleb, if you want a nice story.</br></br>  <br>I didn't say you were wrong, I told you to fuck off.</br>  <br>Nope.<br>Yuuki is the only one in the series who is canonically better at the game than Kirito.</br></br>  <br>So you dropped by to shitpost. Keep being classy.</br>  <br>There's also the Integrity Knights, but they're hundreds of years old. Well, not Alice, but she's a heroine; she gets to be better than him.</br>  <br>That's stupid.</br>  <br>Maybe so. Even still, I think if a show's going to bother showing something, it should show it properly. If you can't show it properly, write/animate around it and re-animate for the BD. Or at the very least put some scenery/prop or another character positioned to block the view in the TV version and leave that out of the BD, rather than "hey, here's black over half the screen."</br>  Did the Saofags all migrate to Overlord and are just here to cash in on the Gate shitposting?<br><br>Because it feels that way.</br></br>  It's fucking ridiculous. In this scene you can't even tell if she's killing them or not.  <br>What do you mean?<br>It's a foam prop pushing people away.<br>How is it supposed to kill anyone?</br></br></br>   mfw they take out the "rape" from the captured Nip girl and she was just a normal slave who is still pure.   <br>Yeah, I was a little unclear on that. Her personality made it seem like she had a huge murder boner, but the animation made it seem like she was only incapacitating them.</br>  <br> animes <br><br>I don't blame you for being mad as after reading the manga and seeing much of swill this is. I'm a little mad too.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Itami rages when he learns they made her clean toilets for the last months.</br></br>  <br>Any reasonable viewer would assume, given murderous personality shown, that she is killing them. But you are right, the animation does leave a bit to be desired.</br>  <br><br>They show her decapitating the leader. Then she jumps around throwing rocks at them and knocking them down.<br><br>It's so fucking retarded.</br></br></br></br>  Sourcefags are incredibly vocal this season.<br>GATE threads are full of "muh censor"<br>Gurashi threads are full of "muh skipped panel"<br>GANGSTA threads are full of "muh budget"<br><br>It's ridiculous. Sourcefags used to tell you to read the manga only when the anime was terrible.<br>Now they are so retarded, they want you to read the MANGA adaptation of a Light Novel. Full fucking retard.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Literal autism.<br><br>Tell me the anime version carries the same weight when she's flying around kicking rag dolls with not even a drop of blood anywhere.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Even MonMusu, which is perfect so far as an adaptation, is full of READ THE MANGA.<br><br>Gurashi threads are manga threads at this point.</br></br></br>  <br>So calling trash out as trash is wrong now?</br>  <br> Now they are so retarded, they want you to read the MANGA adaptation of a Light Novel. Full fucking retard. <br><br>because there isn't a translation of the Novels.</br></br></br>  <br>I only participate in anime original threads and general shitposting threads nowadays.</br>  <br>I came here to tell you to watch Overlord but it seems /a/ has good taste this season<br><br>inb4 "&gt;/a/ is x amount of people"</br></br></br>  <br>Then learn japanese you fucking secondary.</br>  <br>I am though</br>  <br>There was blood in that scene. It just vanished too fast for anyone to really notice.</br>  <br>She kills little girl too?<br>Confirmed for shit.</br></br>  <br><br>And this is what the shitty anime adaptation does to people.</br></br>  <br><br>Fucking Naruto had more blood.</br></br>  <br>Well, how am I supposed to know.</br>  <br>you  read the manga </br>  <br>I was thinking before, once the anime is finished, but not anymore I guess since Rory was the reason I watched it so far.</br>  <br> the bandits murdered and raped them, rory forces that guy to dig a grave, then she prays. Then she kills him. </br>    <br>I guess it really helps if they aren't cutting everything out, doesn't it.<br>Anyways gotta wait until the show is finished, I'm pretty sure I couldn't enjoy an adaptation that apparently butchers everything if I read the manga at this point.</br></br>  <br>I'd rather not waste my time on an adaptation that butchers everything.</br>  <br>Chronological order of events leading to the invasion of Ginza<br><br>- Hardy, goddess of afterlife, opens a temporary portal between her world and Earth. This is routine work for her, most of the creatures in her world are from other worlds in origin. <br>- The Empire discovers the portal on Alnus, and starts to build a Gate to lock it in place. <br>- While building the Gate they send scouts (dark elf ninjas with steath skills and spells) to recon the other side. They bring back reports of of advanced civilization, but no sign of armed soldiers anywhere. The Senate takes the report with grain of salt. The scouts also bring back few civilians who are enslaved. <br>- The Empire completes the Gate, and assembles 100k+ armies to march in<br>- The story begins.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So the demi humans are probably from other worlds that she probably shanghaied there?</br>  <br>Yeah, pretty much.<br>In fact the human race is one of the youngest species, and likely came from ours. <br><br>Basically the gate world is a one big zoo, and a collection box for the gods.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, what? You mean she's not offering for him to fuck one of those corpses before she kills him?</br>  <br><br>Hardy opens the gate every few centuries. Every time to a more advanced/dangerous world so that the Empire would face a horrible crisis.</br></br>  <br><br>Hardy sounds like a bitch</br></br>  <br>I don't know where you got that, but no. <br>This is the first time the Empire faced a serious interdimentional conflict, or built a gate. <br>That's why they're so cocky, they never imagined such a difference in power. <br><br>Presumably the last few times she opened it just brought new species to that world.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>You misunderstand. Those are normal, historical conflicts the Empire endured between just normal nations. <br><br>He's not talking about interdimentional opponents.</br></br></br>  <br>I actually wan't to see the animators going crazy with the source. Taking liberties as long as it shows their skills.</br>  <br>All budget no actual talent or skill you mongoloid.</br>  <br>It's the redditors and the malfags.</br>  <br>She's not evil, she's just rightfully arrogant as a being of higher order. <br><br>"Gods exist to keep balance of the universe, not to answer selfish wishes of mortals."<br>"I guarantee happiness after life. Therefore I reserve the right to take lives of any living beings"</br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like if that were happening Rori would know something about it and recognize what was going on.</br>  <br> It's not good you retard <br> It's just good because of budget you mongoloid <br>Really?</br></br></br>    <br>It's not good, they just put in a shit load of money to have more frame and get the animators to do their fucking job instead of offloading to korea or relying on cgi. And even then, frames are off, characters facial expressions are unaligned, and the human form is mangled in a failed attempt at displaying motion. It's shit, because the people behind it lack skill, and no amount of monetary backing can fix that.</br>  I think the worst are people that want the anime to adapt the manga in a light novel adaptation. It happened with Maoyuu too.  <br> Everything takes place in a video game, so technically it is not real. </br>  <br> lich who isn't evil </br>  <br>But all the shit they cut were actually in the novel version as well.<br>Truth be told, manga added many scenes not present in the novel, and the anime adaptation covers those scenes. <br><br>The anime is most definitely referencing both the novel AND the manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br> animes <br> ... <br> ! <br>I don't even need to read the shit you wrote to understand that you are braindead.</br></br></br></br>  Is there even a term for all these anti-edge fags, who took a 180 to the edge fags and now parade around like any graphic depiction of violence, mean words and rape is inherently bad and for /v/ kiddies?

Because that right here is my type of woman and I'm williing to pick it the fuck up.</br></br></br>   âIt was because Misaka was with me that I made it this far. She kept my trembling legs moving, supported my heart as the pressure bore down on it, and kept me in a position to make jokes. With Index, things may have been too focused on magic. With Othinus, it would have been exclusively about Magic Gods and having a clear understanding of their strength might have crushed me with despair. It was because it was Misaka. I survived this long because she was the one by my side. She saved my life and you want me to tell her to back off because sheâs in the way? Who the hell do you think you are!? You donât understand the first thing about the human emotion of this human world, but youâre trying to act like some all-knowing god!!!!!!â  <br><br> âSo take it back, you piece of shit Magic God!! If you badmouth the person who saved my life any more, Iâll go punch you just like you want!!â  <br><br> âI donât care if youâre covered in magma or if youâre over one thousand degrees! Imagine Breaker? I donât need that for you and I donât care if it doesnât work on you! I donât care if my fist melts away or if my entire body bursts into flames. Yeah, if you donât shut that filthy mouth of yours right this instant, Iâll keep punching you until you finally do!!!!!!â  <br><br>Based Touma.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So mikoto confirmed to be the third most important person to Touma?  <br>Not really. He would have reacted the same way if another girl was in Mikoto's place.</br>  <br>Yes, number 1 being Komoe-sensei and number 2 being Tsuchimikado.</br>  <br>It would have to be a magic ignorant person, since he outright said Index and Othinus wouldn't be helpful.</br>  Mikoto haters BTFO.  <br>No, Misaka its really special to Touma, it could have been any girl who was a damsel in distress. Touma's speech is just more of his random ideals, Touma never really answered HP question but dodged it. NT13 doesn't confirm Misaka's importance to Touma like NT9 did for index or NT10 for Othinus. Misaka could easily be replaced by Misaki or anyone who doesn't know about magic.</br>  <br>I don't really think that's the case at all.<br> It was because it was Misaka. I survived this long because she was the one by my side. </br></br>  <br>Like I said it could have been anyone who could take Misaka's position as long as they fit the role of damsel in distress.</br>  <br>He would have said the same thing if another girl was stuck with him in the same way. The thing is that only Mikoto got rekt hard in front of Touma.</br>  <br>I doubt it. He said it was specifically because it was Misaka.</br>  <br><br><br> Haters are trying THIS hard to deny Touma's words and speech that was specifically aimed at Misaka <br>Oh man. Here we go.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Touma has delivered a speech aimed at pretty much every girl he has saved. That doesn't make them special for him.</br>  <br>Yeah. It was Misaka who got involved in that particular situation.</br>  <br>I doubt that he would give such a heated speech for any random girl. And he said that she kept him in the position to make jokes, which is probably because of her personality.</br>  <br><br><br><br>then suddenly she appears</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not even baiting here, but I don't think this speech confirms at all that Misaka is special to Touma. It confirms that he sees her positively, which we already knew, and which applies to plenty of other people.<br><br>I also don't see why anyone's taking this as "Misaka is replaceable, she doesn't matter, get rekt Mikotofags", though.</br></br></br>  <br>She would have gotten Touma killed most probably.</br>  <br>Read vol 2 and NT7. Touma getting that angry for people he barely knows is nothing new.</br>  <br>For some reason, I can actually see this girl trying to take on the High Priest after he trashes enough schools trying to mess with Touma.</br>  <br>Quit downplaying Touma's speech just because you can't accept it for what it is. Touma has made many speeches before, but hardly the kind we saw in NT13. He got seriously mad at High Priest for badmouthing Misaka, who Touma defends and praises and acknowledges as the person who saved him. <br><br><br>If she isn't special in SOME way, then Touma.wouldn't have rage and told High Priest to take it all back and tell him to prepare to get his face punched out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The problem is Kamachi wrote too much that the readers no longer feel anything from those lines at all. This series should end ages ago.</br>  <br> she doesn't matter, <br>No one is saying this. She's certainly not expendable, but her position is still not unique or special to Touma.</br></br>  <br> Kamachi wrote too much <br>This. And he's still going strong. The novels sell less and less every round in Japan, don't they?</br></br>  <br> See the previous thread <br> Mikoto detractors getting blown the fuck out left and right <br>Delicious payback.</br></br></br>   Mikotofags BTFO <br> Mikotohaters BTFO <br> blown the FUCK out <br> Misaka BTFO <br> BTFO <br> btfo <br> BTFO <br>When the fuck did we turn into /v/?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>B-but w-wait for the translation!</br>  <br>This</br>  What did Japan think of this volume?  <br>Stop trying to give me hope. All I want to do is sink on this ship.</br>  <br>2012</br>  <br>His speech is new. His anger isn't.</br>  So is kamikoto a thing ?  <br>1/10</br>  <br>Not baiting just wanted to know</br>  <br>I dont really remember him getting angry because someone was badmouthing a girl. Usually it's because they're harming/exploiting someone.<br><br>It makes sense really, Touma always had a certain respect for mikoto and her powers. Remember he bragged about her to that British princess.</br></br></br>  <br>No t yet </br>  <br>Never</br>  <br>Kamachi thinks so. Even if that ship will never truly reach its destination, it is a thing he tease with.</br>  <br>Holy shit his dead eyes</br>  <br>What  said.</br>  <br>Yeah, it's a thing. Has been since the beginning.</br>  <br>No one has badmouthed a girl as badly as HP did.</br>  <br>Really? You have people like Terra who have done or said worse things that involves abuse and killing. Touma being the savior guy he is, would react harder to that.</br>  So why is Accel poorly shooped in there?<br>Did I miss something?</br>  <br>Read volume 2.</br>  <br>It is a joke image</br>  <br> that blank stare <br>Someone who functions only because there is a damsel in distress is literally a robot who obeys his natural input of "save someone" and can be considered as dead inside as a person</br></br>  <br>What? Be specific and give details, nigga.</br>  <br>You'd know what I'm talking about if you read it. See when the students exploed into gold.</br>  <br>Well yeah sort of. She definitely likes him and he definitely appreciates having her as a friend. There's certainly room for romance there.</br>  <br> it is a thing he tease with. <br>And it's frustrating. Why advertise them alongside two married couples? It means nothing and yet it's infuriating.</br></br>  <br>Wait, did Miyuki win?</br>  <br>Not less enough. We need a dip so that they give us another season to boost sales.<br><br><br> ten years of a one-sided crush with no development <br> still the best romance in that picture <br>Why are light novels so terrible?</br></br></br></br></br></br>   High priest survives magma and then is launched to space <br> mfw it finally clicked. </br>   Mikoto gets BTFO <br> b-but Touma got angry and did what he always does, that completely erases the god damn verbal beating Mikoto got! </br>  <br>Short answer:  yes, but it's not finalized <br><br>Medium answer:<br> Maya arranged their marriage, their engagement is announced publicly. <br> Miyuki confessed, Tatsuya sort of accepts, saying he wants to learn how to love her the same way <br> It's revealed Miyuki was made to be a safe genetic match for Tatsuya so there are no birth defects. <br><br>If you want the full answer you'll have to search for it. The memories are fuzzy so I might have messed up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why are light novels so terrible? <br>Well, Mahouka and SAO have something very much in common.</br></br>  <br>Reminder that a brother and sister having a baby has about the same chance of birth defects as a 40 year old woman having a child.</br>  <br>Look, if you want to go for the incest route you have to find some way to justify it to your editor.<br><br>He likely had to really fight for it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>   It's revealed Miyuki was made to be a safe genetic match for Tatsuya so there are no birth defects. <br><br>Good lord this is an entirely different level of wanking.</br></br></br></br>  <br>see </br>  <br>   It's revealed Miyuki was made to be a safe genetic match for Tatsuya so there are no birth defects. <br>Wait, so she was literally made for incest?</br></br>  <br>So what's more fucked up, fucking your sister, or genetically modifying your kid so your other kid can fuck her?</br>  Jul 13 - 19<br>*2.ã26,630ã*83,179ãShinyaku Toaru Majutsu no Index Vol.13<br><br>What the fuck happened to the sales?</br></br></br>  <br>Japan got tired of the generic tsundere finally, and Mikotofags are somehow angry at Touma.</br>  <br>Ded series.

He defended her and said he appreciated her even if she was useless against magic, they should be fucking happy.<br><br>Shit, it looks like people are never pleased no matter how Kamachi tries to use Mikoto, might as well go international again because there's not much else to do in Academy City until endgame.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is what happens when you have a story with no Accelerator.</br>  <br>But HP literally blew her the fuck out. Just because Touma whiteknighted her doesn't mean it didn't happen.</br>  Last thing we got was Railgun S 2 FUCKING YEARS AGO.<br><br>COME THE FUCK ON JCSTAFF.<br>GIVE US RAILGUN XRD OR INDEX WW3 OR ANYTHING</br></br></br>  <br>who?</br>  <br>The hero we need.</br>   It turns out that Index 3 has been in production for years as a 4 cour anime set to air in 2016 <br>How does it make you feel?</br>  <br>didnt he have a manga on his own now?</br>  <br>I'd prefer they do another season of Souma to be honest.</br>  <br><br>Imagine if they somehow don't go full retard and use the four cour to animate everything from volume 14 to 22 with sidestories included.</br></br>  <br>Misaka has her own manga as well, whats your point?</br>  <br>They also said Mikoto would be so depressed she would give up and stop crushing on Touma, but the opposite happened and now it's obvious she's going to get a power up or something.</br>  <br>Let's compromise.<br><br>Who's up for Shokugeki no Touma?</br></br></br>  <br>The rest of chapter 4 and epilogue is still left, so things can still change even though I don't find it likely.</br>  <br><br>I give it five seconds before the kitchen explodes.</br></br>  <br>burn up kitchen<br>headcrab eating ingredients<br>some random magician chef appearing to get the perfect dish through magic<br><br>it would be a disaster</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If spoilers are true then it will change.</br>  <br>Jap fans are crazy. They probably expected Touma to yell an essay prasing Mikoto and putting her above everyone else if not confess to Mikoto on the spot.</br>  <br>Academy City's No.1</br>   She had decided she would ask Kamijou Touma what had happened to him at that time and that place.

Touma has made many speeches before, but hardly the kind we saw in NT13.

Some anon said he did a couple of days ago.  <br>I won't i'm all for Misaki</br>  <br>Same thing happened in volume 22.<br>Mikotofags raging hard because Mikoto' s meet with Touma wasn't romantic and burning novels and destroying their stuff.<br><br><br>What?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you forgot things like  this?<br><br>He evaded answering High priest's question by white knighting her.<br><br>And more importantly, Mikoto herself noticed this fact, which leaves her unsatisfied.</br></br></br></br></br>    Touma's speech to defend Mikoto is honestly the most cheesy shit I've read in the whole franchise.<br>Holy shit.</br>  <br> Touma's entire speech about Misaka was a lie <br>That's some real delusion.</br></br>  <br>This. Kamachi tried too hard with Touma raging like that. It felt superficial and unconvincing.</br>  <br>Interesting, I thought it was one of the better scenes in the series. It really felt like Touma was seriously pissed off.</br>  <br>It's tied with like fifty other speeches.</br>  <br>Your memory must be rusty anon.

If something isn't a lie, it's either a fact or the speaker is just wrong, and I don't think it's possible for Touma to be wrong here, so if it's not a lie, it's a fact.</br></br>  <br>But he isn't correct, he's implying that Misaka is the fault of him not getting fisticuffs thus being boring when most of the shit that happened was cause of Touma, he didn't really have to take Misaka for a ride you know.</br>   Invincible mummy of destruction persuing us, but kyah I'm close to my one true love <br>Level 5s are so fucked up in the head.</br>  <br> ã ãã¢ã³ã¿éã«ããã¤ã¯æ¸¡ããªã <br>Holy fuck that's cute</br></br>  <br>Well, I could say he's still traumatized and is facing a magic god.

You should try lurking more.</br>  <br> attempting to speak for 'Mikotofags' despite not being able to read Japanese and being BTFO by what was actually in NT13 <br><br>B-but w-wait for the translation!</br></br></br>  <br>Lurk more newfag<br>Here let me spoonfeed you </br></br>  <br> Fans liked the novel so much that it is breaking sales records! <br><br>Does deluding yourself with blatant lies like that make you feel better? Try looking at the numbers or reading the 2ch thread.  already summarized it for you.</br></br></br>  <br>What repost?<br><br><br>Those numbers don't tell a thing about who bought the novel and opinions of those who bought it, you idiot. Unless you can prove the stated claim, go fuck off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A statistic that does not identify 'Mikotofags' is supposed to prove what you want to believe so badly?</br>  <br> Most popular girl get the spotlight <br> But the volume sales isn't doing as well as previous sales. Note the decline in sales. <br> Ergo, the most logical and simplest explanation is that fans are losing interest <br>Hurr durr.</br></br></br></br>  <br>See<br/></br>  <br>No shit, Sherlock. That doesn't tell a thing still about majority reader's opinions. If I wanted to, I could rationalize it by saying anti-Mikoto fans didn't bought it and only Mikoto fans bought the volume. In that case, it's easy to see who's the majority then.</br>  <br>If the next volume proves to sell more you will have to eat your own shit anon.</br>  <br> you want to believe <br><br>No. If not even the most popular girl can help to get more sales and instead sinks it way more tuan usual, there must be something wrong with the novel itself instead of the natural popularity decline. <br><br><br><br>Some Mikotofags didn't like it, some others did. Judging by reactions, it's more the case that the novel wasn't what they hoped for and it is again a repeat of NT3. Pretty much what  said.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> muh sales <br><br>God, this is sad.<br>What happened with enjoying the story for what it is?

That's the whole point of HP's speech.</br>  Reminder accel will win the toumabowl.  <br> weak <br><br>Only because you don't know anything about the Japanese fanbase. But it's fine.

He had no intention on doing an all out brawl.</br>  <br>This isn't the only thread I'm browsing.</br>  <br>And I'm telling you he wouldn't have. Not just me, even Kamachi is telling you that you he wouldn't have. If he was able to contact Index and/or Othinus he wouldn't be constantly running away.</br>  <br> (I need to draw him away from here. I canât let him destroy the school any further with those huge mud arms. And once I do that, I need a more fundamental solution to this Magic God!!) </br>  <br>Same old story. You haven't made yourself credible and try too hard. Anyone who takes you seriously at this point is asking to be trolled. Enjoy yourself.</br>  <br> You haven't made yourself credible and try too hard <br>I just made a simple statement about the fanbase.</br></br>  <br>Again, he would have found a solution that doesn't just involve running away and avoiding a fight if he was able to contact Index and/or Othinus.<br> &gt;The knowledge of those 103,000 grimoires might have been helpful. And Othinus might have been able to give you some accurate advice from the viewpoint of a Magic God. Then you would have been able to clench your right fist and challenge me to a battle focused on Imagine Breaker.  <br><br>Even Touma acknowledges this:<br> &gt;âI could have chosen a different path if I was with Index? I could have taken the best possible path if I was with Othinus? Thatâs not what this is about.â <br><br>He was only able to keep running away because of Mikoto.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And then he did exactly that with Misaka regardless, all you're doing is proving me right.<br><br>No matter what he would have ran and attempted to do a plan with an accomplice.</br></br></br>  <br>You don't get it. You don't get it at all.<br><br>Precisely because Mikoto was there, Touma never planned on confronting HP directly. All his tactics were about avoiding a direct fight, including launching HP to space. If Index and/or Othinus was there, he would have discussed a plan while they ran and confronted him in the end OT style with punching, countering and illusion breaking.</br></br></br>  <br>If Othinus was there he would have succumbed to despair. And if Index was there it would have been too much about magic, whatever that means.</br>  <br>Nope. That's what Touma said to deny HP's words. What would actually happen is:<br>Othinus: Touma would despair at first, and Othinus would calm him down again. Just like NT12. They would continue running away while Othinus analyzes HP.<br>Index: Index would realize HP doesn't have his full power and can possibly even devise a counter to his magic. Lost of magic analysis and myths getting brought up. She might even see the spell Aleister used on to weaken them.</br></br></br>   here<br>And to add, both paths would end in face punching, counter-speeching, and illusion breaking.</br>  <br>Index and Othinus would be more useful</br>  <br><br> Index <br> Useful <br><br>It feels so weird to read this yet I can't deny it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  That's what Touma said to deny HP's words <br>So you're claiming that Touma is making this up because he doesn't want Misaka to feel bad, or what?</br></br>  How would accel slow down HP?  <br><br>Brothers!</br></br>  <br>I find it hilarious that it is the same case in NT3. Index would have solved the whole fucking thing from the get-go. Mikoto is only there to steal the other girls their time to shine.</br>  Isn't it about time for the translations to be posted?  <br>By changing his vector.</br>  <br> Index would have solved the whole fucking thing from the get-go. <br>I'm still mad about that.<br><br> Birdway would tell us how it works anyway <br> Russian don't want to share their info. <br> Oh shit what I'm going to do?! <br><br>And then Touma was retarded with his<br> I'm protecting Index by not asking her about Saronia's magic. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. That is what Touma truly feels. The point is that he doesn't know about 2 things:<br>1. The extent of HP's power.<br>2. How to counter his magic.<br><br>Because it was Mikoto, he had to run away. Because it was Mikoto, could only run away. Because it was Mikoto, he was able to create a plan that allows him to avoid a direct confrontation. Because it was Mikoto, he was able to survive without having to fight. Even Fiamma comments that Touma was only frantically running away because of Mikoto.<br><br>If it were Index and/or Othinus, he would not have run away all the way until the end. HP might have lived after getting his illusions broken, or he might have gotten "killed" by Kakeru instead of getting killed by Noukan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You know what this series needs?

What is what Touma truly feels? That HP is correct? Because that's exactly what I'm saying - if he feels that, then he has to just be making up the whole speech to make Misaka feel better, and that seems a little silly.<br><br><br>I personally think Tsuchimikado's kind of a cunt, so Hamazura/Touma/Accel.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fair enough</br>   NT7 May 10-22 <br>146,213 (12,184/day)<br><br> NT8 September 10-22 <br>135,661 (11,305/day)<br><br> NT9 January 10-19 <br>117,639 (13,071/day)<br><br> NT10 May 10-18 <br>115,978 (14,387/day)<br><br> NT11 October 10-19 <br>115,099 (12,788/day)<br><br> NT12 March 10-22 <br>114,317 (9,526/day)<br><br> NT13 July 10-19 <br>83,179 (9,242/day)<br><br>tl:dr NT12 was the big drop off in sales, not NT13</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What Touma said is what he feels. That is what we are talking about.</br>  <br>So, then, isn't Touma upset because (he thinks) Misaka is legitimately valuable and that HP is wrong?<br><br> I think we might be agreeing and that I'm just identifying you with another anon who was disagreeing with me. </br></br></br>  <br>You don't understand. The entire point of the conversation is that Touma would not have ran all throughout the novel if he was with Index and/or Othinus. Mikoto is valuable to him running away and avoiding a direct fight.</br>  https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/<wbr>index.php?title=Toaru_Majutsu_no_In<wbr>dex:NT_Volume13_Chapter_4#Part_8</wbr></wbr>  <br>The point of the conversation's changed several times, and I think I failed to keep up. I thought the point was still whether Touma was bullshitting.</br>  <br>No, that's another conversation. The root of this conversation is this , which is about whether HP was correct in that Touma was only constantly running away and avoiding a fight because Mikoto was there.</br>  <br>The only thing the conversation implies is that the chain of events would have been different if Index was there, and different again if it was Othinus.</br>  <br>PRAISE LOLI GODDESS</br>  Misakafags literally BTFO.  <br> Kamijou had been unsteady on his feet after the previous battle, but she felt him moving slightly while still resting on her shoulder. He silently reached up as if to grab the giant falling comet with his right hand. <br><br> She could not tell what meaning there was in that. <br><br> The boy himself probably could not explain what was hidden there. <br><br> âYouâ¦?â <br><br> She asked a pure question. <br><br> She was answered by an ominous cracking sound. It came from the body of the boy who was right next to her yet seemed impossibly far away. <br><br> âIt honestly doesnât matter to me who the hero is. <br><br> After everything that had happened, it was only now that Mikoto truly felt fear. <br><br> âAs long as everythingâs been resolved, I couldnât ask for anything more. <br><br> She felt fear rising from the pit of her stomach. <br><br> âSoâ¦ So Misaka, this didnât need a hero. <br><br> All the while, she heard the intermittent sound of cracks running through something. <br><br> âIt ended without losing anyone and thatâs all that matters. <br><br> Specifically, it came from the boyâs right arm. <br><br>If Noukan didn't intervene, wonder what would happen To Kamijou's right arm?  Dragon's right? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> âThat takes care of Gremlin. You made quick work of them.â <br><br> âWait.â Kihara Noukan double-checked something while grabbing the cigar with the arm. âI only took out the High Priest. I still have at least Nephthys and Niang-Niang to go.â <br><br> âWhat are you talking about?â The emotion had vanished from Aleisterâs voice once more. âThen you didnât do that?â <br><br> ââ¦â <br><br> The golden retriever honestly wondered what that meant. <br><br> He looked down on Academy City once more. <br><br> What was happening in that city? <br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128441673#p128462741">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Noukan literally Giga Drill Breaker's HP </br>  <br>I'm still mad at how he brought Shiggy, and Misaka when everything would've been solved so much faster if he just let Headcrab do her job</br>   Mikotohaters trying again despite the amount of BTFO they received last time <br><br>Masochists.</br></br>  <br>Uho hoi</br>  So, how's the arc?
