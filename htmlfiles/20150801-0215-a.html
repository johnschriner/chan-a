[ JoJo no Thread<br>PASTEBIN: http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87</br>  Gay Priest is here now.   he became an adventurer at sea <br> Josuke's friend <br> Sigi Q <br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>aaaaaaaaaaaaaand it's gone to shit again..</br>  <br> brandy Brendo </br>   desire to never get caught <br> arrow gives him the perfect power that eliminates whoever tries to find out your identity without leaving a single trace <br> screams his name out loud and gets caught <br>I love you Kira but jesus christ that's some Diavolo-tier retardedness</br></br></br>  <br>I never understood why they didnt call anybody else to help against Pucci. Josuke would've been OP against him, Giovanna too.</br>  <br>holy fuck didn't see that one</br>  <br> you will never read BrBr's Booze Adventure </br>  I want Star Platinum to ora ora my ass. I want him to star finger inside me. I love Star Platinum so much. I want him to ram his gigantic fist up my ass. I want his gigantic arms around me. Star Platinum is the most amazing stand ever created. I wish to have sexual intercourse with him. Star Platinum is more beautiful that women to me, Star Platinum is more inspiring than men to me. Star Platinum is wonderful. My emotions toward Star Platinum are stronger than one thousand projectile-vomit powered boats. My love for Star Platinum is stronger than Pucci's gravitational force. Star Platinum should be the new mascot of the whole series. Star Platinum should be the new mascot for Shonen Jump. Star Platinum is the most beautiful stand and it should be law that every stand user has him, even Tsurugi Higashikata. <br><br>I want Star Platinum to METEOR FINGER my ass, I want him to Time Stop inside me, I want to feel his A rank precision, I want him to peruse my ass, I want him to mMeteor Finger Thorn my back, I want him to Ora Ora me. Hard. Harder than ever. I want it. I want Star Platinum. I want him in a Stand Disc. I want</br></br>  <br>I know Crazy Diamond is a generally strong stand with a useful ability but what makes you think he would have been OP specifically against Pucci?</br>  <br>He probably thinks that he can change his stand back into original form or separate pucci from the baby</br>  <br>Crazy Diamond would basically nullify C-Moon inside out ability but I don't know how he would be any useful against the other two Pucci stands</br>  <br>He can fix spaghetti, he can fix Pucci.</br>  <br>Gives Pucci his fucked up foot back, now he's slower</br>   Pucci underestimating Jolyne <br> even after DIO told him not to hold back against Joestars <br><br>fucking dumbass</br></br></br>    <br>Part 4 is the best. Nice warm feel.</br>  <br>Part 4 reminds me of life in my home town. Of my high school friends and youth.</br>  <br>When did he underestimate her? I honestly don't remember , I do remember when Donatello was underestimating her and Pucci told him it was a mistake. A lot if time Jolynes gang hand a advantage over Pucci but Fate was always on his side.</br>  <br> When did he underestimate her? <br>I dont remember which chapter but he berates himself for not killing Jolyne after getting Jotaro's memories</br></br>  <br> Crazy Dimond <br> Jonathan the esplorer <br> Polly and Kujo zefu </br></br></br>  <br>I think you know what you're talking about but I'd have to reread to be sure. Was pucci always planning on killing the kujos or did he just decide after they caused him so much trouble. He was using jolyne to get to Jotaro at first so he probably only saw her as a tool and he took out Jotaro. Other then that the only time I can say he fucked up is by deactivated MiH to finish off Emporio and reactivating it in ghost room with all the oxygen. He was so close to winning.</br>  <br>I don't think he ever planned on killing them until Kennedy space center, actually. Even that memory thing he left in Donatello just told her to go spend time with her family and not to follow him. He was always more focused on heaven than the Joestars.</br>  <br>Tomatoes were broken and pasta was boiled to make that spaghetti among other things. Pucci's foot was always like that from the beginning. There's nothing to restore.</br>   JoJo no Thread <br>I can't believe I started a new meme</br>  Is Giorno truly invincible? Can nothing touch him anymore post arrow?  <br>The arrow fell out, so no.</br>  <br> post arrow <br>K</br></br>  <br><br>I'm talking about GER Giorno. how does its ability exactly work?</br></br>  <br>Thanks boss.</br>  Your favorite Jojo uses your favorite Stand to fight your favorite villain. How much ass is kicked?  <br>Nobody said to post the bow.</br>  <br><br>You're gonna stay in this thread gay priest, you won't make it to the next one!</br></br>  <br>Good luck with that</br>  <br><br>Which time? He was stabbed/cut 7 times with the arrow.</br></br>  <br>You know there are new scans for Part 5 right?</br>  <br>You posted a kujo. Fate decided that they're useless against Pucci.</br>  <br>I meant GER</br>      <br>Why would Dio put a flesh bud into someone who is already loyal? He didn't do that with Vanilla Ice or Gay Priest.<br> 0/10 </br></br>      <br>is there one with Doppio and Abbacchio?</br>    <br><br>Just post the full photo, quality isn't lost on 4chan.<br><br><br>There might be one on doc's album.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Thanks anon</br>  <br> Why would Dio put a flesh bud into someone who is already loyal? He didn't do that with Vanilla Ice or Gay Priest. <br> I have no idea who Enya is. </br></br>  Waiting everyday for part 4 anime  So one oy my firends finally finished Part 2, and got into part 3, and asked me if he stone on Joseph's collar in SC is supposed to be the stone of Aja.<br><br> I hadn't even noticed there was a gemstone on his color to begin with </br></br>  <br>Ice was gay for DIO and Pucci was his fuccboi. Enya was just some old hag you can't trust old people.</br>    <br>this is fucking hilarious i don't care if it's a shit meme</br>  <br> 4 hair swirlies <br>0/10 costume you suck kid</br></br>  <br>Is this from the new Prison School chapter?</br>  <br> is this from the new prison school chapter. </br>  <br>explain this meme please<br><br><br><br>it's been out for a while</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not a meme. I just didn't want to dip into my Pucci_.png folder.</br>  <br>ok i was thinking that it meant Dio had been shitting in the bathroom  metaphor for shitposting  or that he spend so much time in the bathroom or  closet  that he hadn't seen anything in a while like that anon not knowing the picture had been out for a while  unless he was shitposting </br>  <br>You can take it that way. It's not a meme yet but I you wanna start using it go ahead.</br>  <br> like that anon not knowing the picture had been out for a while   unless he was shitposting <br>I wasn't, i started reading Prison School today</br></br>  <br>yeah i dind't mean to falsley implicate you sorry<br><br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=LI4<wbr>IxGK4vRI</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>honestly this combination is just bad, but i like it for some reason but it's very confusing to listen to, the songs just clash too much. this coming from someone who unironically likes all star</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Beautiful</br>  <br>That is pretty disappointing considering it was made by the guy who created things like https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Jwh<wbr>jqdSPw5g</wbr>  [ ] and https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rCS<wbr>ytPi8e5U</wbr>  [ ] (my favorite mash-up)</br>   tfw part 8 jojo could have been Josefumi <br> Kira could have been his brojo <br><br>Seriously who is Gappys brojo? Will it be Karera or does he just not have one <br><br>We're already on chapter 50 and he's usually just alone and hangs around with a different character for a few chapters <br><br> yfw Araki splits Gappy back into Kira and Josefumi halfway through part 8 <br><br>Kiras dead though so yeah that won't happen</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's obviously fucking Yasuho, and maybe Daiya and Tsurugi</br>  <br>It's Yasuho you dumb fuck. Just because she's the love interest as well doesn't disqualify her.</br>  <br>Yasuho seems more like a love interest, and if you think it could be Daiya that's like saying it could be Joshuu</br>  <br>They're so close as friends that she might as well be the Brojo and the main love interest, unlike girls like Erina and Suzie Q, who aren't as big of mutual friends with their JoJos as Yasuho is with hers.</br>  <br>It could be if that antisocial fuck lightens up.<br><br>I wonder what he and Jobin are up too</br></br></br>  <br>this'll be good because we've essentially gotten rid of a worthless character role by combining it with a useful character role</br>    Why does Daiya look like the Tree Girl?<br><br>Also am I the only one that likes her a lot?<br> I just now noticed this fucking panty shot, fucking Araki God damn </br></br></br>  <br>I don't think it's that they weren't friends with their guys, it's just that for the most part any love interest in the past didn't have powers or anything, so we don't really get to see them interact much because the plot usually revolved around fighting the bad guys. And hell, at least we got to see Erina and Jonathan having a montage of enjoying each other's company, even if that was pretty much part of the courting process.<br><br>Well, unless you count annasui, but why the hell would anyone ever count him?</br></br></br>  <br>it makes me wonder if the "2 navals thing" will ever come up as anything important  most likely not but it would be really cool if old man sbr norisuke was a combination of 2 people also but i don't think araki would ever plan that far ahead</br>  <br>because if you don't he'll fucking murderape you unless your name is jolyne</br>  <br>Norisuke having two navels sets off alarms for me as well. I have more faith in araki than you though, I don't think he'd throw that out there for no reason.</br>  <br>Anassui just had an obsession with her, that paid ff because he helped out a lot and really just wanted to make her happy.<br><br>I was really glad when she kept her promise of marrying him in the new universe, that was nice</br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of that, my favorite panels will always be the ones where Anassui and Weather meet those two girls and one of them asks "Are you two murderers or something?" And Weather answers with "I'm not, but he is!" It was hilarious.<br>[spoiler[Especially because at that point Weather was more scary and fucked up than Mr. Cut up his girlfriend and her lover would ever be.</br></br>  Am I the only one that actually liked the MiH chapters of part 6? I see a lot of other people put off 6 because everyone dies, but at the end of every part so far we get someone with a deadly, super strong god-like stand that's somehow defeated by their own stupidity and I liked that Araki finally followed through with it for once instead of just killing off a brojo and having then having the villain get defeated somehow.  When you think about it, Yasuho is a much better example of a relatively normal girl who learns to find her own power within herself and control it than Trish.  Jolyne isn't exactly normal with her criminal history and all. <br><br><br>No, you're most definitely not the only one.</br></br></br>  <br>I feel bad when people are put off with part 6 as their least favorite part and some even hate it. MiH was great for reasons just as you said. A lot people will say emporio killing pucci is an asspull but it was pucci fucking up that let that happen. He's the only villian to successfully kill two jojo's and their brojos. C-moon was a cool almost scary stand but MiH was a monster that none of then could beat unless Pucci himself messed up. People tend to hate on 6 cause they don't understand how MiH works and they think everything from parts 1-6 is meaningless and thats a shitty reason.</br>  <br>Kek I forgot about that. I assume that was after he  regained his memories? Or am I mistaken <br><br>Also, ctrl+s is your friend, just found out about it last week</br></br></br>  <br>Weather Report the stand killing pucci isn't an asspull because it had already been demonstrated that both pucci and weather had OP as fuck stands. If I had to pick a part i liked least it would be parts 5 or 6 but it's not a clear loss, I like all the parts a lot.</br>  <br>I thought it was kind of an asspull because WR was on star finger levels of 'can do whatever Araki needs at the moment'.</br>  <br> Yes it was after he got back his memories, Donatello was an idiot </br>  <br>Weather report made sense atleast with stuff that wasn't heavy weather. Anything else it did was weather related. Star finger made no fucking sense. In the anime I was expecting them to have SP get into a fingering contest with the world.</br>  <br>The fuck does weather have to do with pure oxygen?</br>  <br>Emporio explains it but I forgot.</br>  <br>Oxygen is in the air, he just filled ghost room up with oxygen when pucci was speeding up time and that's what fucked him up.</br>  So did Emporio keep Weather Report after killing Pucci? Hell will he ever use his original stand again, since he can only go into the room in the prison?  <br>Yes he should still have weather report and be able to use his ghost room. Whitesnake ignores the one stand per person rule since he was able to give FF another stand ability that fucked her up.</br>  <br>The bus was too late</br>  <br>huh<br>i wonder if that has any significance</br></br>  <br>anti-meme posting is still shitty memeposting<br><br>KEKEKEKEKEKEKEKE HAI spiggy give me your best image</br></br></br>  <br>Oh shit<br><br>Well if it was, he should've just used it to 1 shot bad guys , but i guess he's not the overly violent type.</br></br></br>  <br>Originally thought it was Joshuu but he seems to be a caesar-dio type rival, the brojo is yasuho</br>  <br>I wonder if that was his intention - either he felt like making a shitty meme video and did that for whatever reasons, or people kept requesting him to make said shitty meme video so he made it terrible out of spite</br>  <br>Gay Priest had left hours ago to other memes.You failed, shitty bus.</br>  <br>wow i never noticed that either<br>i know sugar mountain had a lot of panty shots too</br></br>  <br>Please learn what an asspull is, you sound like one of those people who says cuck constantly</br>  <br> cuck  <br>Don't go bringing /tv/, /pol/,/v/ buzzwords here.</br></br>  <br>I'll make more of these sooner or later</br>  <br>Why.</br>  <br>Don't. Keep the thread slow and steady.</br>  <br><br><br>Emphasis on later</br></br></br>  <br>i want sugar mountain to squat over my face<br>i'll bet her ass smells great</br></br>  <br>50 year old ass that she pulls random things out of.</br>  <br>only 50 in spirit<br>i want her to squish my face with her ass</br></br>    <br>Saved for shitposting purposes</br>  Since Valentine wanted offspring, do you think it's possible that the guy from the flashback in JoJolion really could be related to him?  <br>You can do better anon...</br>  <br>Nice theory</br>  HOTPANTS<br>O<br>T<br>P<br>A<br>N<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If Stone Ocean doesn't have Styx's Renegade as the ED I will cry<br><br> Not like it matters since it won't be adapted to anime <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/ZXhuso4OTG4  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br> literally engaging in sex only for the purpose of children <br>kek</br></br>  <br>But Kekloin was dead when Jolyene was born</br>  <br>Has slow points for the more emotional episodes<br>Has high speed high octane for mid fight to be continued's<br>I approve. Additionally, the lyrics fit, especially considering the running from the law.</br></br></br>  <br>But that won't work, because Come Sail Away will be used for Part 7's ED, and you can't do double Styx</br>  <br>Is there anything more nothing than her death in SBR? I had to go back after finishing to find out what happened to her since no one noticed her death and the action moved into high gear with the President fight.</br>  <br>I seriously thought she was fine up until the end, just too hurt to keep on fighting.<br><br>Whoops.</br></br></br>  <br>It's funny because some people didn't know that she died.</br>  <br>What. I do not remember her dying at all</br>  <br>What if this Renegade song is the EP?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6tu<wbr>4wWSbnIs</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> Gold Experience gets stabbed with an Arrow here <br> literally just damage <br> Giorno stabs GE with an Arrow later <br> becomes the most OP shit of all time <br><br>God dammit Araki</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not the band Renegade, the song by Styx. That song wouldn't fit the song's style at all.</br>  <br>*series style, I mean</br>  DEAD H・P<br>E<br>A<br>D<br><br>H<br>・<br>P</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>X Ambassadors is the name of the band, Renegade is the name of their shitty song.</br>  So this is only tangentially related but I feel like this would be a good place to ask.<br><br> Where the hell do I find a SOUL'd OUT download? </br></br>  <br><br><br>Yeah, after the President fight, they moved on to fighting Dio (which was confusing) with ZA WARUDO powers (which was doubly confusing), so I kept expecting Hotpants to show up, but she never did.</br></br></br>  <br>Well I had it figured out by the time Steven, Lucy, and Johnny were together and nobody seemed to care about Hot Pants. Which is kind of weird because I don't think any of those 3 were there for her death.</br>  <br>Actually, did Valentine list Hot Pants in his little speech about all the people he could bring back? I don't remember off the top of my head. If he didn't, well that explains why everyone was confused.</br>  <br>Only 2 SOUL'd OUT songs were used in the MADs the rest are Diggy Mo solo stuff. They can be a bit of a pain in the ass to find since his lable has gone on this massive crusade taking them down all over the place. Anyway pretty much all SO albums are on Nyaa. And everything for Diggy Mo except Diggyism 2 is at the same place.</br>  2 new Part 5 chapters went up<br> Vol.52 Ch.488: The Grateful Dead - Part 1 <br> Vol.52 Ch.487: The Firenze-Bound Super Express - Part 2 </br></br>  <br>I just read them, I loved seeing my favoritte part 5 in high quality.</br>  <br> favoritte part 5 fight*</br>  Who wants to bet that Karera is this universes Yukako?  <br> hair user <br> hair user <br><br>hmmmmmmmmm</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, she's Karera.</br>  <br>Who is the result of Yukako being carried over to the new universe by HEAVEN</br>  <br>Nah, it's not the same world. It's just referencing.<br><br>While we're on the subject she references Kars and Giorno a lot too.</br></br></br>  <br> carried over to the new universe by HEAVEN <br>The SBR universe is not linked to the old universe. ESPECIALLY not through Made in Heaven. Stop it.</br></br>  <br> Stop it. <br>Okay.</br></br>  <br>The villain doesn't even matter because just imagining Joseph with Osiris brought me to orgasm. Regardless though:<br><br> Joseph with Osiris vs. Kira <br>The most extreme match of poker in the entire world.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> brandy brendo <br> polly <br> power to control stand <br> aristacrat </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is she asking Rohan this?</br>  <br> getting out of my chair to make myself some dinner <br> Read the first sentence of this post <br> mfw </br></br></br>  hey can one of you kind anons seed part 1 &amp; 2 for me?  <br>She's Kars</br>  <br>What I find surprising is joining these threads and finding out people hated part 6 and loved part 5.<br>I'm of the complete opposite opinion.</br></br>  Just looked at the calendar and saw the release of SC Vol.4 Blurays was just a few days ago. How long do we have to wait until they're up for torrenting?  <br>I got my copy yesterday but I have no BD ripper. Somestuffs will get around to them eventually.</br>  <br>Fair enough, I can wait a while.</br>  <br> She's Kars <br>Literally how?</br></br>  <br>We've been through this lots of times. Long black hair, bandanna with a little bit sticking out from the front, very similar sandals, introduces herself by reflecting light, name isn't written in kanji for the sole purpose of having it start with the same one as Kars. Also look at how the previous three new characters to be introduced had references to the other three pillarmen.</br>  /r/ing the hamon/hamin isn't coming back picture  Anyone else dislike the fact that there are rock men or whatever they are? Seems pretty boring.  <br>Her power is literally hair<br>Yukako's power is literally hair<br>"Nope she's Kars"</br></br></br>  <br>She's neither, she's Karera. <br><br>She does reference both of them though and the Kars references are slightly more numerous.</br></br></br>  <br>Until she's a confirmed rock I wont belive</br>  <br>The other Pillarmen were referenced? When?</br>  <br>She probably isn't but she doesn't need to be for the allusion to be obvious. All the referencing going on is much more superficial than you seem to think</br>  <br>I'm glad we don't have literal shits for hair as the JoJo</br>  <br>Well we had a rock guy who fought with whirlwinds<br>and we had a rock guy who fought with things latching onto his opponent.</br></br>  <br>What does gay architect have to do with pillarmen aside from being rock? I don't recall them latching on unless you're talking latching on as a brain. That one is pretty farfetched if so.</br>  <br>Yotsuyu, Jobin, and Aishou have had references to Santana, ACDC, and Wham respectively.<br><br>It's nothing huge and they're all obviously their own new characters, but there are so many similar lines and moments and lines and poses between them that it's pretty blatant.</br></br></br>  <br>Well he used that weird gravity thing to cause objects to hurl themselves at his victims, which could be compared to Santana attacking Stroheim with his flesh thingies.<br><br>Both fights were 2 against 1, and the main goal of the 2 was to open a door. For Joseph &amp; Stroheim it was to get Santana into the sun, and for Norisuke and Gappy it was to get the hell away from spiky chestnuts.</br></br></br>  <br>Second "lines" was meant to be "abilities"<br><br><br>Moving through the hatch in the ceiling like Santana with the hole in the wall, both fights with the Jojos ending with one of the fighters tackling the other into water, Norisuke and Joseph's lines about not knowing their gender or how they breed. Also I hear in the Jorge novel Santana is said to have gravity as his mode, but I'm not entirely sure if that one's true.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yukako since she didn't die to MiH and would be the exact same</br>  JJBA is getting a Live action adaptation and you're in charge of the casting. Who do you choose to do any part?  <br>What kind of adaptation?</br>  <br>I'm tempted to say a movie, but that won't do justice to any of the parts.<br><br>A web series?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm going to say "probably."<br><br>Just like how I like to think that Jotaro wears Ceaser's bandana as a belt. Because Joseph decided to pass it down the generations.</br></br></br>  Is JoJo a Christian manga?  <br>A Catholic priest is the antagonist of part 6 and brings the apocalypse because of his boner<br><br>I don't think so</br></br></br>  <br>I think Araki just likes that pattern.</br>  <br>Joseph burnt Caesar's bandana when he fought Wham, though</br>  <br>We would've known if it was the Stone of Aja, and he would've used it against DIO.</br>  <br><br>I'm also getting the feeling that this is going to be one of the things Araki forgets.</br></br>  <br>That's assuming the two navels thing was ever supposed to have anything to do with this in the first place. <br><br>Actually even if it doesn't, it can be explained by the method they use to cure the disease, like what we saw in Norisuke's flashback.</br></br></br>  <br>I feel like I skipped all of Part 8 because I remember none of this and it's never brought up again. Like that guy that looks like Valentine who Josuke remembers seeing.</br>  <br>That's because it's just a random single-page nonsequitor in the first half of part 7.</br>  <br>I was talking about the image. I don't remember that fight unless it was the one in Kira's apartment.</br>  Next episode Murderfish incoming, some people is going to hate it and others gonna love it (specially TF).<br><br>The playlist with specials (actually 20, this guys throw one after another):<br>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?li<wbr>st=PLaWNUYckT3OPH6k_Ow2FB1CwijLzU3b<wbr>7p<br><br>And the character songs of every girl<br><br> Miia <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeZ<wbr>A87zIICk<br><br> Papi <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3R<wbr>xycLwmnQ<br><br> Cerea (I'm spiderfag but I love this one) <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJO<wbr>Q2siJ2j4<br><br><br>As every thread report and ignore the shitposters, crossboarders and secondaries going full retardation.

What would you do to show her that either her physiological differences from a human woman either don't matter to you, or are minor obstacles that can easily be overcome with a little creativity?<br><br>I want to hear your ideas.<br><br> One thing I'd do for Miia is take her dancing. I'd put in the effort (probably learning it without her knowing so I could surprise her) to research and learn dancing techniques for human and Lamia partners, and then give her basic lessons. Miia not only strikes me as someone who'd find dancing romantic, but knowing she could do something that required feet just as well as an human woman could would probably make her feel very special. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Darling <br> Hubby <br> Master <br> Husband <br> Honey <br>One of those has to be it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Kurusu Kimihito.</br>  <br><br>Kimohito Kurusu, but even Smith acknowledges it's just easier to call him "Darling" since she's heard it so much.</br></br>  <br>Give that bitch a blanket.<br><br>MGs love blankets.</br></br></br>  <br>Darling is one of the better harem protags mind you, he's cool in my book.

It says "vol 4 Mero".  <br> They made her hands less pointy and more human so they can just draw her with regular gloved hands <br>I can imagine her wearing those gloves during sex because she is scared of hurting Darling.</br></br>  <br> 1．Rachnera Arachnera <br> 2．Belle Sadique <br>Yeah I'm pretty hyped for that.<br><br>Shit, do we know when we're getting the third track for the girls though?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would die from happiness.</br>  <br> Lightweight  <br><br>Centaurs confirmed for having more than one set of genitalia?</br></br></br>  <br> not wanting your woman to scar your back while making love <br>This fucking guy.</br></br>  <br> This fucking guy. <br>It's not what you want, anon. It's what SHE wants. She loves you, she doesn't want to see you bleed.</br></br>  <br>If she's in the midst of passionate lovemaking and can't help it I'm not going to be upset about it.<br><br>See </br></br></br>  <br><br>Depends on the views of the people around us. You can't please everybody.<br><br>Constant reminders about how much she is dear to me. Talking and listening. Being honest with each other.<br><br> I could always just resign from my job and leave the hustle and bustle of the city and hotel life. Find a quiet town in the middle of nowhere, open a small cafe using my experience in the kitchen. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  There may be more character songs on the way, it wouldnt be a surprise to see the Mons get the Individual CD treatment. <br>And it feels like its just a matter of time before Lala gets one. No announcements have been made yet. <br>And then Polt!!!</br></br>  <br> See  <br>I saw that. But the point is it is distressing to her enough that she stopped the sex. Just because you are fine with being hurt doesn't mean you should nor consider her feelings. If she wants to wear gloves you should let her.</br></br>   <br> yfw Darling got his own song </br>  1620¥ per character song album<br>1296¥ per OP/ED album<br>(1620*6)+(1296*2)=12312¥<br>Works out to about $112 locally.<br>And that's before shipping. Tell me anons, is the price okay? I haven't bought music online before(especially with international shipping), so a little apprehensive about this. On the other hand, I think I paid about $30 local for a twin CD set of Human Seed Destiny soundtrack. But that was a few years back.<br><br>If we break the price down by number of songs though, 32 songs, works out to about $3.50 each. Fuck it, I'll consider it my contribution to Crabman's newest shell.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good taste.

He's honestly not. People just assume he can UBW and shoot swords at people all willy nilly. His long range caladbolg is basically nuking a servant from orbit, which would be effective versus masters, but Archer is just garbage at fighting most servants that aren't Gil or Caster.  <br> Also he's Batman </br>    <br>the fact that he was granted hero status is already a miracle</br>  <br>Archer&gt;Shirou&gt;Gil&gt;Every other servant.<br>UBW is a stronger GoB and GoB is capable of beating every servant except Emiya.<br>It's not "rock-paper-scissors", it's "scissors-rock-bigger rock" with the bigger rock beating the shit out of the smaller rock and the scissors. <br>Nasu wanted to make Shirou an underdog but failed miserably.</br></br></br></br>  <br>hes a failure who cant even kill himself</br>  <br> batman <br><br> billionaire <br> young <br> virile <br> like 6'4 <br> has access to every public technology and tons of private/government tier technologies <br><br> """""""inferior player"""""""" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That statement only confirms the previous statement, rather than denies it, if that's what you're going for. It might be what you're going for of course since you are confirming it.<br><br>Batman isn't the strongest, fastest, smartest, or most skilled; the various Robin's are better than him at their niche and Lady Shiva is a far better fighter. Yet even if a Robin could score a 9 in their individual category, Batman is a solid 8 in most categories which allows him to be a mixed type who can change his strategies on the fly with a bit of variety.<br><br>Each of Batman's villains also might have something they can outclass him in towards his niche, yet they cannot beat the guy who has the full package. Because Batman is the guy with planning and tactics above all, because he's rich, because he's trained, because he has various methods to aim to his advantage.<br><br>Batman was never the most skilled or the strongest; Dick might be a more skilled fighter, Tim Drake is smarter or more of a detective, and Jason is more edgy.<br><br>He's not Batman because he's the best, but because he's got versatility and always knows how to twist and push the situation to always find a path despite being inferior in a world of super humans.<br><br>Lancelot is a terrible example, he's a super human in a world of super humans; not someone who needs to play it smooth with tactics and knowledge to find a path.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's not a hero if you played the game, he's an improper summon due to a messed up grail.<br><br>In any proper grail it wouldn't be possible to summon him, he's just a CG, not a hero.</br></br></br>  What about EMIYA with Alaya's support?  <br> UBW is a stronger GoB <br>wut<br>UBW can only replicate edge weapons (what fits Shiro Comcept of SWORD) and shield but burns Mana as fuck, all the other treasures like enkidu or whatever else is like clubs, hammers etc, cant</br></br></br>  I mean, archer doesn't really try to fight FIGHT anyone in UBW other than the occasional "guess I'll do my job" type of moment like with caster.  <br><br>Would Archer have won the war if Rin just stayed in the cellar like he asked her to?</br></br>  <br> Lives in world full of superhumans and ungodly immortals <br> parents are DEEEEAAAD </br></br>  <br>ok, ok, he is a tseudo hero and its cause his deal with the world (or gaia, whatever) <br>he stills gets a place in the throne of heroes, but his summons and after life works different than the rest (expect Arthuria cause World pact too)</br></br>  <br>Except you're really, incredibly wrong for reasons so obvious I won't even go into them.</br>  <br> he stills gets a place in the throne of heroes, <br><br>As a guy who's infinitely summoned to kill people throughout time and space, in various worlds.<br><br>Which he hates</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this is why he starts to regret everything and tries his dam best to rewrites past<br><br>still, is a hero, on a time when is 99.9999% impossible for anyone to be granted said status.</br></br></br>  <br>Not everyone gets to make a contract.</br>  is Shielder a new hero class or just in game class?  <br>He's not a hero, he's a Counter Guardian<br><br>It's not that impossible to be a CG, anyone can do it even in the current age if they're willing to sell away their immortal soul for power.<br><br>People don't seem to get the difference here; Heroic Spirit is a status you can only achieve on your own by being so incredible that you overcome fate itself, being a CG isn't anything too complicated if you know how to make the contract.<br><br>Its like making a deal with the devil; its not hard, but you're paying for it forever. No it isn't impossible to be a CG, and no he isn't a hero.<br><br><br>Even Rin knows how to do it offhand, and she indeed did do it in one timeline.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was a class that was cut from the original F/SN<br><br>Its a class as old as all of the others, its from one of the three to five lost routes.<br><br>Her role in the game was taken by Gilgamesh in the end.</br></br></br></br></br>  He did manage to kill Heracles once with that Caladbolg shot  <br>tseudo hero, he got that status cause the pact boost, but instead of dying and spend eternity in the Throne to be copied for the wars, he was put to work as CG. <br><br><br>with enough time, and mana, he should be able to pull the 12-13 kills needed <br><br><br>being a total dick was her role?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Archer's swordsmanship was so good it gave Hercules a sword boner and made him regret being summoned as Berserker.<br><br>Lurk more, newfag OP.</br></br></br>  <br> Would Archer have won the war if Rin just stayed in the cellar like he asked her to? <br>Probably not since his objective is to kill Shirou, but if his objective is to win then it's not impossible although unlikely.</br></br>  <br> being a total dick was her role? <br><br>A stray servant from the previous war; maybe she ate on people between wars to survive, but not in a malicious way? Its like a vampire needs to feed to survive, in order to keep living she had to exist as a stray cat that need to keep going somehow in order to live. If you want to keep living no matter what, you might have to give up on a few things. Was noted to kill her own master, but considering she would have been a heroine, it was probably a Medea type situation where her master was a dick.<br><br>Her existence was like someone who was lost or stray, an abandoned puppy, Shirou would have ended up taking her in as the stray servant.<br><br>We don't know too much beyond this<br><br> Stray Servant [Others] <br> A heroine candidate that vanished without a trace during the plotting stage. <br> She was conceived of as an "abandoned puppy" type heroine, who killed her Master and went on a rampage. <br> As a Servant of the shield, she was going to be a rival to Saber, the Servant of the sword, but… <br> Just like Gilgamesh, she would have been a Servant that had remained behind after the previous Grail War. <br> Unfortunately, though, she had to be cut for the sake of keeping things manageable for the player. <br> After all, around this point, the plot itself was starting to stray. Not only Rider, but even Caster was a potential heroine candidate. It was terrifyingly chaotic. <br> Hmm? Fuji-nee? I don't know what you're talking about, Fuji-nee never had a main route even during the plotting stage.  <br><br>Might sound like a scary type, but I can see a bit that her real situation might have been a reversal, like Medea. Where she was good and tried, but it didn't work out, and she tried to hang on anyway for some reason.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> and she indeed did do it in one timeline. <br>What are you basing this on?</br></br>  <br>His swordsmanship isn't "Soo good" like its the strongest, rather Arthur comments its pure, it flows like water, and its beautiful.<br><br>Sasaki's swordsmanship is far more beautiful, but Archer's is also something one marvels at, like its more of a dance than a killing style.</br></br></br>  <br>Was it just his swordsmanship or his tactics and way of fighting in general?<br><br>I would think EMIYA would have trouble one on one against most servants that are specialized in that kind of fighting a la Lancer, Saber, etc. But he could easily deal with them via long-range attacks such as BPs and the bow he used against Saber in H/A (Hrunting?)</br></br></br>  <br>CG TOHSAKA</br>  <br>IF he is already on the long distance snipping but once in close combat, Lancer (both Zero and Fate) and saber are better than him.</br>  <br>Haha what?</br>  <br>Jesus christ that's a completely different fucking world.</br>  <br>Dick's inferior to Bruce in terms of combat. He's the superior acrobat, not the superior fighter.<br><br>Cassandra's the superior fighter.</br></br></br>  <br> its pure <br>Actually that's just poor translation.<br><br>Remember that archer is basically batman. Everything he does is for efficiency. In the VN saber says that Archer's form is while beautiful has few wasted movements flowing like water.<br><br>So not pure as in beautiful, but as in very basic and animalistic.<br>Archer can only move his body the way it moves. He doesn't have prana bursts, can't tank shots, or break the laws of physics like the rest of the servants.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> how do Archerfags convince themselves he is so OP so strong? <br>Because Nasu tells you that he's weak and then proceeds to show you how strong he can be. Just shit writing.</br></br>  <br>Its just another timeline<br><br>Even the end of the story talks about how they're just different timelines brought together, just like the April Fools storyline. Which is kind of a joke on itself considering the end of AF story.<br><br>People sometimes think its "That's an entire different worldverse; F/SN has a world verse, Tsukihime has a worldverse, Extra and Apoc are their own thing entirely separated, Mahoyo is entirely separated, they're all different and seperate", however that's not correct at all and is proven wrong.<br><br>Everything is just alternate timelines of each other on the infinite timeline scale. Everything connects at the root, each individual world-line can work under somewhat different rules, but they are all connected in the same way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Archer loses almost instantly in two routes, yet people just look at one route and go "See"<br><br>While missing a huge point that almost all servants have a route where they do incredible things and almost win, or have a chance of winning. <br><br>Every servant has a route where they'll be shafted, every servant has a route where they do incredible, which is supposed to show you that everyone has a chance based on situation.<br><br>Thus showing that its not power levels that determine anything, but rather situation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> however that's not correct at all and is proven wrong. <br>Well dude holy fuck, the Alaya from capsule servant is nothing from the Alaya in the normalverse. There happy? Christ this is getting autistic.</br></br>  <br>What a piece of garbage, had to force myself through most of this season. A disgrace to Fate/Zero and the majority of season 1.</br>  <br>sevants are like pokemons, there are pokemosn agains which they are really good, others agains which they sux and her and there a couple than can beat the royal crap out of anyone</br>  <br>You just can handle the swag.</br>  <br>Archer pursued saving everyone as a goal, attributing inability to save everyone in lack of power. He pursued the goal of saving everyone endlessly with no regard to himself, with no regard to others, in the end relying on such a thing as a contract with the world as his hope of fulfilling it. However he never achieved it. His job as a Counter Guardian drove home the impossibility of saving everyone, no matter how much power you have. It made him think of his goal as pointless and futile.<br><br>UBW Shirou is NOT "saving everyone". He is "trying to". Within his limits. He knows that he won't always succeed and that there will be situations where he WONT be able to save everyone and he is okay with it as a matter of reality and he is not going to go beyond his own limits in his goal, because unlike for Archer, for UBW Shirou, LIVING by your ideal, TRYING to save everyone is beautiful and enough in itself. So he won't go to self-destructive lengths Archer went, he won't be making any deals with outside forces and he won't try to ACCOMPLISH ideal instead being content with living by it, understanding that ideals are impossible to accomplish(because they are ideals, an utopia)</br></br></br>  Could Archer kill Lancer if he somehow assassinated lancer with Caladbolg?    <br>Got the link of the opening?</br>  <br>A lightweight boxer with masterful technique can still lose to a heavyweight even if he packs more punch per pound.<br><br>Archer is skilled but has weak stats. But other servants can overcome him by brute power. <br><br>He is an admirable underdog but still a weak fighter in the context of the war.</br></br></br></br></br>    Can Lancer kill Basara?<br>Can Basara make servants listen to his song?</br>  <br>this is literally exactly what it says in the VN<br><br>Lancer comments that he's "far too good at close combat for an archer", not that he's an actual challenge. Lancer is nerfed the whole fight by a command seal, not to mention he doesn't even use gay bulge. <br><br>It's worth noting though, archer kills Hercules 6 times without even using UBW. He's basically batman, like <br><br>says. Since he has no legend, all he has is what he's got - he just happens to be very, very skilled with what he's got, and knows how to utilize it to the fullest. He can beat people if he does it right, but if someone instantly breaks out gay bulge or excalibur, he's just going to get fucked on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Actually that's just poor translation. <br><br>Where's the Japanese text?</br></br></br>  <br> Lancer comments that he's "far too good at close combat for an archer", not that he's an actual challenge. Lancer is nerfed the whole fight by a command seal, not to mention he doesn't even use gay bulge. <br>thats only for hte 1st time in the school grounds, in the church he was handing archer his ass</br></br>  <br>The only NP that damaged Rho Aias so heavily for the first time ever in Archer's memory was Gae Bolg.<br><br>Majority of Servants won't have such a hax weapon like Gae Bolg with such a convenient concept since not even Odin's spear could defeat Rho Aias according to Archer.</br></br></br>  <br> https://mega.co.nz/#!RxR1gDjY!b0e5L<wbr>Q3gcA8Zk8MUZvb6OoWWdYMn4MWPHvMtvsAl<wbr>ZlA</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Irish heroes have plenty of weaknesses.<br><br>One common gaess among Irish heroes was the inability to refuse an offer of hospitality even from your most grave enemy which is how a lot of Irish heroes end up getting poisoned and shit because they can't refuse an offer of food or drink, even if it was poisoned.<br><br>Archer could get Cu to eat dog meat in the middle of battle if he wanted to be a super douchebag.</br></br></br></br></br>  because underdogs are fun and he's pretty cool as a character.    <br>Oh look, it's this bitch.</br>  <br>True. Irish heroes wouldn't be Irish heroes if they didn't swear the most retarded, stupid oaths or make the most idiotic promises that fuck them over and over again.<br><br>People say Cu would be the strongest in Ireland but also forget that being summoned in Ireland would also be a double edged sword for Cu.<br><br>There could be territory that Cu is not allowed to tread on in ireland or a descendant of an Irish hero that Cu is fated to always lose too no matter the scenario.<br><br>Irish heroes are just more trouble than they are worth.<br><br>It's best to summon heroes from less pain in the ass mythologies to deal with.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lot of new fun servants</br>        <br> PROOFS?!?! <br>In the Jap VN.<br><br><br> Since he has no legend, all he has is what he's got - he just happens to be very, very skilled with what he's got <br>This, but I also say batman in that he's willing to break the rules(AND he is also willing to kill to save).<br><br>Why is archer/lancer rivalry so great? Because they are opposites. Archer literally said honor was worth shit and told Lancer to feed it to the dogs(aka himself). <br><br>Archer doesn't play by the rules, honor, or valuing life(though he does value it). <br><br>He does what he needs to win and thus why he was granted Mind's eye<br>http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Arch<wbr>er_(Fate/stay_night)#Eye_of_the_Min<wbr>d<br><br>Watching only the anime some might believe he's strong, but in reality he's betting his life with open shots at his vitals so he can fight NEAR equal grounds with lancer/saber.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He is a proper hero. Just one from the future. And one that wasn't personally remembered.</br>  <br>Is that you, Leonidas? <br><br><br>dont tell me this is cesar</br></br></br></br>  <br>Correct in both cases.</br>  <br> Jap VN <br> Links to ENGLISH Type-Moon wikia </br></br>  <br>Caesar really grows on you after awhile.

The only exception is Saber. <br><br>Like Gil, Archer can shot one shot Kojirou from afar. Archer can also just aim for Illya and kill off Berserker like Gil, and he actually DID kill Berserker a few times even when he was just focusing on Berserker. Rider, as Shinji's servant, is a total nobody.</br></br>    <br>Such boring, uninspired designs.<br><br>They clearly rushed this shitty mobile game and hurried it out as soon as possible.</br></br></br>  <br>how does that fat fuck qualify as a saber? <br><br><br>...he summons a Galeon, right?</br></br></br></br>    <br>Caesar was a warrior in life, he was a military general<br><br>Even if he looks fat here, his stats still show he's the real deal.</br></br></br>  <br>best boy.</br>    <br><br><br>ROMAN STRONK</br></br></br>  Every hero tends to have three costumes, as they level up<br><br>If you don't like their costume, they tend to get more interesting as it changes.

He cannot attack Assassin from afar due to the terrain.</br></br></br>  <br> Limiting class to one dude in a game that's basically an artist free-for-all </br>  <br> What's the deal? <br><br>The deal is simple, for those that don't remember<br><br>"Hassan only" was only a rule in the Fuyuki war, as it was specially set up that way. So that even if servants could qualify for Assassin, they were not allowed as it was set up to try to force them out of that class.<br><br>It was noted in F/SN that Heracles should be possible to summon as Assassin, but due to the way its set up it is supposed to deny him.<br><br>That was a rule set in place in only that contest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was asking about the lore explanation.<br><br><br>Thanks. Forgot all about that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man I want to see Blackbeard's third level form with the badass coat.</br>  Alexander the great, child form  <br>what a qt</br>  <br>I want to commit a crime</br>  <br>Two in the pink, one in the twink.</br>  <br>To explain the metaphysics why:<br>In the Great Grail ritual of Fuyuki, a catalyst is required to make a servant. In the event no catalyst is given, the summoner themself is made into a catalyst, and given a hero appropriate to their personality and mindset.<br>For Assassin class servants, a catalyst is already provided for you; nothing a magus can do will interfere with that. The word "Assassin" (from Hashashin [from either Hashish-in or Hassans-in], the arabic order) links to Hassan-i Sabbah, no way around it.<br><br>In the Moon Cell, no catalyst is required, one's servant is assigned by the SE.RA.PH. system.<br><br>We have no idea what's going down in Grand Order, but I'm willing to bet catalysts aren't involved there either.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> not webm  <br>one job</br></br>  <br>You know, hell is a lot more entertaining when you're not walking into it.</br>  <br> In the event no catalyst is given, the summoner themself is made into a catalyst, and given a hero appropriate to their personality and mindset. <br><br>That's something assumed by people, but its unconfirmed by Archer in UBW. He's all "No, catalyst is necessary, if you don't provide one the grail will find the closest thing nearby"<br><br>Its noted to date that all summonings in Fuyuki system have been with a catalyst, thus proving Archer's words even more true. People thought Sakura didn't use one or that Uryuu didn't use one, but they did.<br><br>It was noted that Uryuu's family were a family of mages previously even though he didn't entirely believe it. His sister was the one in the family that generation to be born with any magus talent, but he killed her. He fucked around for fun that the book he took from his home was a book of spells and evil, but in a sense it was true, even if it wasn't as direct of a catalyst as can be.<br><br>Note that this is only talking about the Fuyuki system, but to date a catalyst is always necessary there. Instances where it didn't seem like a catalyst was used, it was still used.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   kill Berserker six times <br><br>I really hate how anyone with multiple lives or massive endurance are just there to be punching bags for someone else to look good. Heracles should've steamrolled the competition considering he's as strong as Olympian gods even back when he was mortal.</br></br>  <br>It also just makes everything awkward when talking about power levels.<br><br>Archer killed Berserker six times, when Saber had trouble fighting him at all with out the graveyard advantage. Which kinda makes her look like shit.<br><br>I know circumstances, Nasu, rock paper scissor, w/e.<br><br>Discussing power levels is dumb.<br>Why do we keep doing it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> when Saber had trouble fighting him at all with out the graveyard advantage. <br>Isn't because Shirou Saber is shit while Rin Saber said to steam roll Berserker with ease?</br></br>  <br>Archer is lying out his ass and every other time it comes up before or after corroborates it.<br><br>No, Uryuu's book was not a catalyst. Both Urobuchi and Nasu said Ryuunosuke's personality was what called Gilles de Rais. "The book was a catalyst" is fanon bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br>serious archer can kill caster<br>serious archer can kill gilgamesh<br>serious archer can kill saber<br>serious archer can kill rider, but everyone can lol<br>serious archer can kill fake assassin<br>maybe lancer if he does it quick enough<br>probably not berserker unless they had knowledge of his abilities and a plan</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Discussing power levels is dumb. <br> Why do we keep doing it? <br><br>People never get the greatest irony of TM, that power levels never meant anything from the start. Not in the "nasu a shit hack shit piece of shit" sort of way people seem to usually think, but more like "From the start it was a point that luck, strategy, and situation always beats power. If you know about your opponent and have time to plan, you can always overcome them<br><br>Its like how power levels in DBZ, the entire reason Toriyama introduced them was to show how unreliable they are. Yet people didn't get this, and thought "Woah, power level is everything"<br><br>Holy fuck, the irony is top class when F/SN demonstrates hundreds of times that its not power level that's important, and anyone can beat anyone basically yet thousands of threads later people still can't grasp that and instead just pale it off on the excuse "Well Nasu a shitty hack".<br><br>The writing isn't that complex, yet people miss even something this huge. There are a dozen variables that can change each battle, yet people realize the ones they want.<br><br>Like HF showed that Hassan could beat Saber in battle using tactics and experience, yet people bypass that one by going "Well he didn't directly beat her by punching her, it was shadow, so it doesn't count and it can never count, its shit".<br><br>That was directly an example of strategy and terrain being used in a smart way, Shadow would have just as soon killed him, yet people only count what they want.<br><br>Sasaki vs Saber, Lancer vs Archer, Saber vs Berserker in UBW, every fight shows how things can turn out so differently in different situations or why its different in that one situation to give someone more of an edge, yet people argue about power levels as if that's the main thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's hard to tell the gap between, them, the numbered stats Nasu vomits out mean jack shit, and Saber never really got to do much after becoming Rin's servant, she just fought Assassin again, and it kinda went them same, except his sword got bent, and she lucked out.</br>  <br> Archer vs. Assassin<br>Nasu-san CHECK!<br>If it's a straight out death match, then Archer will win. But Assassin is an oddity that fights under different battle conditions from the other Servants. While many Servants are offensive, Assassin is defensive. At a Servant-killing battlefield like Ryuudouji and with Caster's anti-sorcery defensive barrier, sorcery and Noble Phantasm power is decreased significantly. As a result, if it's not a powerful Noble Phantasm, then he won't take a fatal wound. Which means that the battle between the two is clearly swordsmanship. With Archer having his sniping sealed off to him due to the terrain effect, could Archer actually lose...?<br><br>Archer vs Rider<br>Nasu-san CHECK!<br>If you think about it, Archer will win, but at long range, Rider would be? Just like that question, their compatibility is not very good. Since both aren't fixated on the methods of winning, they'd definitely both choose a low-risk and high-return type of warfare.<br>Even if Archer takes out a Saber-class holy sword, he doesn't have enough Prana to draw on to maximize it, so it'd be hard to for him to attack Bellerophon. What determines victory or defeat is whether Aias on its own would be enough to block Bellerophon perhaps...?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Assassin vs True Assassin<br>Nasu-san CHECK!<br>If it's just Servant vs Servant, then without complaint, True Assassin would have the better chance of victory. Right, Kojirou doesn't have any means of breaking through Zabaniya. But there's more to it. The problem of Zabaniya is that it's not immediate death. If a normal heart gets destroyed by it, then the person dies immediately but the opponents are Servants. And especially against Kojirou, who has a strong spirit alignment, even if his heart is destroyed he still will have some fighting power left in him. Right in the interval after TA uses his Noble Phantasm, Assassin could close the gap and use Tsubame Gaeshi. Which means....it would be a draw since both of them would end up dead...?<br><br>Rider vs. Lancer<br>Nasu-san CHECK!<br>The two boasting the most outstanding speed in the game. Rider, able to move like a bullet and race around the battle field vs Lancer, able to counter attackers with a lance with the speed of gods, while standing still. In average speed, Rider is faster, but in immediate maximum output, Lancer will win. While Rider has several different types of Noble Phantasms, Lancer also has protective ability from rune sorcery, hence counter measures from her mystic eyes. Against an expert monster exterminator like Lancer, one who has a monster alignment such as Rider might seem to be in for a tough fight....!?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't Rin Saber pretty much Shirou Saber since Rin had to share mana with Shirou too?</br>  come on it's time to stop these cancer threads  <br> At a Servant-killing battlefield like Ryuudouji and with Caster's anti-sorcery defensive barrier, sorcery and Noble Phantasm power is decreased significantly <br><br>i dont remember they mentioning this on the VN<br><br>RETCON RETCON</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, she was called super super better, but all she really did when she was super mode was nearly lose to Assassin.</br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br>The anti servant battlefield was stressed multiple times, explaining why people can't just go around Assassin or blow him up from afar.<br>The defensive barrier negating magecraft never came up, though.</br></br>  <br>Are you being serious or a joke?</br>  The autism is ripe in this thread.  <br> serious archer can kill gilgamesh <br>wasnt she saving the extra mana to use excalibur?</br></br>  <br> can't go into seed mode </br>  <br>Its not about extra mana<br><br>Saber was called like a hundred times better in stats.<br><br>However if you're talking about why Saber didn't use Excalibur, its because she admits she'd be dead before she could charge it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>more like hte wind thingy</br>  <br>1-Nasu is a hack<br>2- Archer could stand a chance of winning sniping everyone from 40km away instead of playing with swords.</br></br>  <br>Terrain<br><br>She'd be dead in the same way as if she used Excalibur as well, and its doubtful it could kill him.</br></br></br>  <br> serious archer can kill caster <br>He literally had to try not to kill her, so yes.<br> serious archer can kill gilgamesh <br>Sketchy as fuck. UBW is faster than GoB, but it doesn't have spaceships. Also, as always when discussing Goldie Ea &gt; The world.<br> serious archer can kill saber <br>He can go for a mutual kill by confronting excalibur with excalibur, yes. He can kill Saber Alter with the 6-fold attack, yes. He can also snipe her for fucking ever, but any misstep and he is dead. He can't take Saber 1v1 head on.<br> serious archer can kill rider, but everyone can lol <br>Actually, he would be in pretty fucking deep shit. Medusa with sakura has some nice buffs to combat, and once she summons pegasus, she has dragon-level defense, so most of his attacks wouldn't work.<br> serious archer can kill fake assassin <br>Meh. The location limits his angles of attack, and Fakie canonically drove off Berserker, so that would be a pretty tough fit.<br> maybe lancer if he does it quick enough <br>Unless Archer goes full asshole with the Geas exploitation, winning is going to be difficult.<br> probably not berserker unless they had knowledge of his abilities and a plan <br>Well, "serious archer" is already taking in account archer coming in with a plan, if it's just Archer pulling all stops but without a clearly defined plan, he probably would only kill caster. But anyway yeah, Berserker would wreck his shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Excalibur from the base of the stairs would absolutely kill him, the question is if Saber would survive the magical energy expenditure. The defensive terrain and barrier can only do so much, it's not going to halt the second strongest noble phantasm in existence.</br>  <br>Nah, supplying mana aside she's much better as a master. There's a stat sheet that gets posted all the time, take a look at it.</br>  <br>that blast risk killing shinji too, making the whole save plan moot.<br><br>said plan is stupid anyway, who the fucks care for shinji</br></br></br>  This needs to get updated.  <br> He can go for a mutual kill by confronting excalibur with excalibur <br><br>Are you fucking autistic?, The swords he projects are the same one but one rank less<br><br> Then how he can block all the gilgamesh attacks? <br><br>It's Nasu, ain't gonna explain shit, you dumb faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Not him but wtf does Nasu mean</br>  could lancer without geass kill everyone? gae bolg is op as fuck    <br>i read this as <br> that blast risk killing shinji too, making the whole plan to save moot. <br><br>fuck</br></br></br></br>  <br>better be bait</br>  <br>?<br>They ARE decreased by one rank. Until he breaks them, which raises them by one rank again, restoring their original power.<br><br>Not for excalibut though, it is still kinda out of his reach.<br><br>Anyway, it is explicitely stated that he could recreate an excalibur within UBW and that the resulting clash would wipe them both out.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He'd have the fight of his life on his hands dealing with Herakles, one wrong move and he's dead.<br>Gil would never let him use it.<br>Artoria may survive a second time.</br></br></br>  <br>Japanese for lurk more.</br>  <br><br>Nasu means Anus in Japanese</br></br>  <br>If that were the case then she would have done that, she wouldn't even go up the stairs, she would have blasted the grail from half the town away.<br><br>That is not the case<br><br>Which is why she did not do that. Rin said she had enough mana for Saber to use Excalibur at most twice, not once.<br><br>Thinking its the best NP in existence aside from Ea is assuming a lot as well. Even whether Ea is at the top is a question; in the sense that its for sure called in the top class of NPs at least, but not at the very top. People assume Excalibur is the bester because it was originally called comparable to Ea if not a bit weaker. There could be others within that same gap as well however that are comparable in the same way. It never said that it was "directly right below nothing is between them", it just said they're comparable. Even though we know beam mode isn't Ea's real power.<br><br>CCC has a few NPs like that; an Anti Planet NP that can damage even Aristotles as noted, an NP that is the authority of all divine spirits combined to warp reality to the whims of the user with no limit, and something that encompasses all of human history to forceful reincarnate the opponent in a way that's said to be absolute.<br><br>To say Excalibur is the absolute besterest aside from Ea, is an absurd wank. No Garden of Avalon did not say what you think it said, I've read that part as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Anyway, it is explicitely stated that he could recreate an excalibur within UBW and that the resulting clash would wipe them both out. <br>He openly admits he would not "wipe out" Saber at all in their exchange. Their exchange would cause Archer to be blown away and Saber to be untouched.<br>The only reason the threat worked is that the backlash of two holy swords impacting each other would certainly kill Rin and Shirou who were in the reality marble with them.</br></br></br>  <br>Nasu is a servant called Nostradamus</br>  <br> They ARE decreased by one rank. Until he breaks them, which raises them by one rank again, restoring their original power. <br><br>That takes thirty seconds you fuck, no he's not spam breaking shit, that takes way too much energy from him.<br><br>Its noted that Hrunting is a relatively easy one to break, and it still takes him a bit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I swear it's not. Hardly ever go on this board but peruse sometimes like now when im high. But yeah teach me your ways</br></br>  <br>Nasu Kinoko was the scenario creator and lead writer for Type-Moon and Fate/stay night, Tsukihime, Kara no Kyoukai, Mahou Tsukai no Yoru, etc</br>  <br> CCC has a few NPs like that; an Anti Planet NP that can damage even Aristotles as noted, an NP that is the authority of all divine spirits combined to warp reality to the whims of the user with no limit, <br>Those are not real noble phantasms and you know it. The ones to use them are not even real servants.</br></br>  <br>If this isn't some gay bait, either I'm too out of it to remember or I just did not notice him there. Unless he was in HF because I haven't seen that</br>  <br>Even with Geass, Lancer can kill caster, archer, fake and true assassin and rider unless she is mounting pegasus.<br><br>This leaves Gil, which has an coffer full of Cu's weaknesses (even without geass he still has divinity, and I'm sure there must be a spear of leotard slaying somewhere inside GoB), trinkets to avoid the instant death, etc...<br><br>Berserker can straight up soak Gae Bolg hits until the heat death of the universe, so no.<br><br>Saber can win the coin toss, probably repeatedly. And since they both need time to charge up their NP, if they fire at the same time and she survives, Lancer is going to get blasted to oblivion, while he has no way to avoid excalibur.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If Archer projected a beam sword, could he activate it's NP effect well he is actively levitating it?<br><br>Like well he was fighting just have it float above them and then blast someone like an automated sentry?</br></br>  <br> People assume Excalibur is the bester because it was originally called comparable to Ea if not a bit weaker. There could be others within that same gap as well however that are comparable in the same way. It never said that it was "directly right below nothing is between them", it just said they're comparable. Even though we know beam mode isn't Ea's real power. <br>Excalibur is right below Ea's real power in terms of output.<br>Destroying the world does not increase Ea's output, it is a side effect. Excalibur on max output is right beside Ea on max output, just a notch below.<br><br>And Amita Amitabha takes seven turns to activate. It might deal 6 billion damage but it's not practical.</br></br></br></br></br>  I understand rivalries like Seiba vs Gil and Alex vs Darius, I don't get why Jeanne vs AACHA, unless it's just for the white haired brown man in red.  <br> &gt;Berserker can straight up soak Gae Bolg hits until the heat death of the universe, so no. <br><br>People should really learn to check out official word on the subject rather than assuming.<br><br> Q. Lancer, Caster, Assassin, and True Assassins; all with normal attack and Noble Phantasms of B or lower. If they fought against Berserker, wouldn't it be a one-sided fight? Or are there any of them that can match up against him? <br> A: Assassin and True Assassin by themselves wouldn't even be a fight. Lancer can use his runes and Noble Phantasm together to temporarily raise the rank to A, but it'd still be a very disadvantageous fight but "one with some chances". Caster has two front-line Saber-class defenders, so if she uses her high sorcery then she'd be able to deal damage, but that would be limited to 2 to 3 times. Also, in the game, Assassin was able to push Berserker back because of the terrain advantage and support from Caster (weighing down Berserker's body). ...Well, since the compatibility of Assassin and Berserker is horrible, the fact that Berserker was even pushed back is enough to say "whoah, Kojirou's amazing". <br><br>Lancer can kill Heracles entirely, but its a very uphill fight where he doesn't stand a high chance.<br><br>However there are a few chances.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Wait, so I got it backwards...?<br><br>Well, time for meto check the VN. But if you've got the quote, do feel free to post it.</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you but what did he mean by it's Nasu, ain't gonna explain. Sorry just the way he used it threw me off, as if it was an object or something. Is Nasu known for creating some sort of deus ex machina, unexplainable shit?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128833112 <br>Delete that shit from your comp now.</br>  Heroic spirit seems to have possessed Waver's body, probably due to Flat. Same situation as Apoc.    <br>They were just kinda the odd people out.<br><br>Should have had Lancer instead of Jeanne, but she is a blonde swordswoman, so gets priority.</br></br></br>  <br>So I completely hallucinated the whole "immunizing himself to what killed him once" requiring either a fucking one hit multi-kill, or 12/13 different ways to kill him?<br><br>Unless Lancer can infuse his spear with each rune and it counts as a different way each time...<br><br>But yeah, didn't keep myself up to date with the interviews, my bad.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> "Yes. Do not use your holy sword, Saber. I will have to oppose you if you do. <br> In that case, the ones to disappear would not be us, but the people around us. <br> …Knowing you, you would protect that kid at the cost of your own life. Even I will die if I project the holy sword. <br> In that case, only Emiya Shirou would survive. That would be pointless." <br><br>Apparently it's not that Saber's NP will overpower his, but the cost of using it will kill him.<br>Saber would sacrifice herself for Shirou, otherwise she'd be the last one standing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Saber still had a plenty of mana. Shirou Saber literally had no mana coming from him.</br>  <br>This has to be bait...<br><br>In the off chance that it's not, yes, you're right. The original sentence is "It's magic, I ain't gonna explain shit" it was reworded to suit the situation.</br></br></br>  <br> So I completely hallucinated the whole "immunizing himself to what killed him once" requiring either a fucking one hit multi-kill, or 12/13 different ways to kill him? <br><br>That is still in place, but you've forgotten the whole "Can be killed multiple times at once if you go beyond his threshold of pain enough, when you kill him".<br><br>Caliburn killed him seven times at once, partially charged Excalibur killed him three times.<br><br>Gae Bolg has a chance of killing him all at once, or its just a special situation with this weapon.<br><br>Likely he needs to raise his strength big time to throw his spear hard enough to entirely kill Herc in one go.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   2738 attack <br> 4069 HP <br>What has this shota motherfucker been eating, those stats are absurd</br></br>  <br>That's what threw me off. Or more specifically, how in the name of fuck is she not dying if she doesn't protect Shirou? She outruns the explosion? A bubble of untouched space forms (like the eye of a typhoon) as she is the source of one of the two forces? But then why doesn't she calmly take a few steps sideways, puts Shirou behind her and exclaims "Checkmate motherfucker! -sorry Iri-?"</br>  <br>Promise it's not im sorry I was just really stoned earlier and its 2:48AM where I am and yeah. I hardly have any attention span so everything is wtf to me right now.</br>  <br>It's fucking Romulus it says so write on the card.</br>  <br>Probably a safe space is created behind her noble phantasm, in the same way she was protected momentarily from Enuma Elish in the Fate route.<br>The bubble would be small and envelop around her, and she wouldn't have time to stand right above Shirou, I guess?</br></br>  <br>*right</br>  <br>Well, thanks for the clarification! My bad, I was wrong.<br><br>So it boils down to command spells once again...</br></br></br>  <br> So it boils down to command spells once again... <br><br>No, its more about rune magic to boost himself, and bet it all on one chance to finish this guy all at once, perhaps.<br><br>Command seal doesn't really play into this.<br><br>Its still a low chance, but its "a chance". If he regens from Gae Bolg and becomes immune then he might be stuck, but we also know that Gae Bolg works in a bit of a special way, so its hard to say entirely.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>porn of her when?</br>  <br>Although, a command spell would raise that chance decently.</br>  <br>Don't forget Cu would have to know about God Hand ahead of time to even bother.<br>What's most likely in a clash between the two is him using Gae Bolg without rune enhancement and accomplishing jack shit for being B rank.</br></br>  <br>From the wiki page of Romulus and Remus<br>  Their mother was Rhea Silvia, daughter of Numitor, king of Alba Longa. Before their conception, Numitor's brother Amulius seized power, killed Numitor's male heirs and forced Rhea Silvia to become a Vestal Virgin, sworn to chastity. Rhea Silvia conceived the twins by the god Mars, or by the god Hercules. <br><br>Mars/Ares is the half-brother of Hercules/Heracles so depending on which story Nasu decides to go with he is either the nephew or the son of Herc.</br></br></br></br>  Can the gang of Robin Hoods take on the King of Heroes?  <br>Well, the "do one action really, really, really hard" sounded like a job for a command spell to me.<br>"Lancer, wreck his shit with one spear throw."<br><br>If Lancer is still working for Kirei, that shady priest can even afford to make it double, raising Lancer's odds spectacularly.<br><br>But yeah, on it's own it's, like often with Cu, a coin toss.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Could Iskandar's army?</br>  <br>In CCC they meet and fight a few times<br><br>Gilgamesh acknowledges him in a small way.</br></br></br>  <br>Surely the Robin Hoods won't run in a straight line in a bright desert.</br>  <br>Robin Hood gains a bonus against an army</br>  <br>Well shit, I didn't know that. My bad. That's interesting.</br>  <br>Shirou, Sakura, Issei, etc.</br>  <br> Archer :: Of course I’m a subordinate. But, well, what’s wrong with it? I never had any contract saying “you can’t hand out detailed data on your employer.” I just had a spare moment or two and I looked into it. Bad habits from life just don’t fade, do they. If nothing else, I’ve always been praised for my peeping habit, if I do say so myself. It was free of charge, so I’ll give it to you cheap. In exchange — yeah, that’s about right. The life of the one who ruined this Grail War will do fine. We might’ve been defeated, but this was my master’s battle. …It’s no good for one stupid person’s desires to stomp all over that. <br><br> …was that it? Though BB held his life, he didn’t sell himself. Just like the other Servants, he was showing his loyalty to his Master. <br><br> Gilgamesh :: Your character aside, your Master was a respected military man, was he not. Teaching a man with nothing but his tricks to boast of to see the righteous path…For a rat, you were able to serve a good master. <br><br> Archer :: No way, the old man was a terrible nag, nothing but complaints. He was set to die for his stupid convictions all the way through to the end. But well, it’s the kind of thing you’d think would be a bit much for his age? Playing the knight won’t earn you so much as a penny, and he’d still give his life for it, so how could I laugh at that? …well, you know. I guess in some ways he was too much for me as a Master. <br><br> Gilgamesh :: Hah, so you’re the only one who doesn’t know, then. A cornered rat bites the cat. The “rat” is an ally of the weak who fights against the system — another name for an idiot knight. You, your Master, both of you are most whimsical. There is no living thing as fortunate as a man who can be intoxicated by his own beliefs, is there, Archer. <br><br>He's a guy that despite not being seen as the strongest, managed to piss off each of your servants, BB, and basically everyone else. He's an annoying type of guy that can poke at people quite well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, they would hide and be sneaky basterds. As long as the enemy doesn't have a long range anti-army noble phantasm, they're good.<br><br>They can't do much to some faggot sipping wine on his golden throne upon his golden flying ship, shooting golden treasures out of golden warpgates.<br><br>That's not even counting that hiding yourself is slightly difficult when your opponent has a world destroying attack. Well, technically you'll remain unseen, but it won't do you a fuckload of good.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have any more?</br>  He'd probably be broken as fuck with enough mana from Alaya, but he's a low-tier servant.  <br> Faceless King [Noble Phantasm] <br> No Face May King. Green Archer's hidden Noble Phantasm. <br> Robin Hood is an incarnation of nature, introduced and inherited as a custom of the Celts from the (Spring Festival) Beltane Festival after the establishment of the "May Festival." <br> In this festival, they make a circle and dance around a pillar built in the center of the village square where a boy who is almost a man impersonates the "May King" and a girl who is almost a woman impersonates the "May Queen." <br>This "May King" is a metaphor for Robin Hood. At this festival, the May King magic costume of green skin is just clothing with ordinary brown accents. &gt;Needless to say, with these leaves and brown stems (Green Man), Robin Hood is definitely the incarnation of nature.<br> Wearing the May King costume erases any sign, so that those who wear it naturally melt into that appearance. <br> With this, Robin Hood holds the same level of ability as the Fairy Puck. <br> Said to be stronger than the Bow of Prayer on the back of Green Archer's hand. Disables the reading of each other in battle, a one-sided victory cheat item. <br> Robin is a sniper who hides his figure in this cloak, appearing with Assassin-like behavior. Because it aggravates the Master, Dan, the use of "Faceless King" was forbidden outside of combat. <br> Even in CCC, where it saw a surprising usage, its results were disappointing in Passionlip's hands.  <br><br>This is the NP he was disallowed to use in Extra original due to a command seal<br><br>Its a perfect sort of cheat item, you know its serious business when it says it puts the user at the same level as a fairy in terms of hiding, especially a high level fairy. Even your servant ingame comments that he's pretty much perfectly concealed when he uses it, as they cannot detect him anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> shota <br>she prefers loli, check your privilege</br></br>  <br>Rho Aias is still just a shield.

He should have more weapons than Archer does at the end of the route.</br>  <br>if it was any other servant than saber, he wouldnt have spaced out and have gotten got like that in those two routes.</br>  <br>He can replicate any noble phantasm, they don't have to be blades but they have a massive mana cost.</br>  <br> Archer loses almost instantly in two routes <br><br>He kills fucking Heracles six times, and his left arm basically saves the world in HF.</br></br></br>  <br>And they say pleasing old men for money is just a meme</br>  <br>She doesn't please old men, she pleases Alaya.</br>  <br>She pleases old men for money to pay her denbts to Alaya.</br>  <br> not posting him praising the sun </br>  <br>Alaya is the will of all old men.</br>  <br>I might be wrong here, but as I remember all he can replicate is shields (but it burns a lot of mana) or whatever fits the idea of SWORD that shiro has (an edge close range weapon) which by being a little louse, let him trace swords, dagger, lances, axes, anything with an edge, but he cant trace blunt weapons, nor anything divine, or from materials shiro dont know about <br><br><br>Potential, thats it, but not at 16, the only reason he could hold it against other master in hte war and shit, was cause that connection that let him absorb (or whatever) archers skills and experience the more he fought him</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not true at all.<br><br>The concept of war didn't even exist in Gil's time much less professional soldiers.<br><br>Everyone was so chill that instead of an angry mob with torches, Uruk just sent an unarmed prostitute to deal with Enkidu.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but that boost gave him an insane jump start. It's said it would take Fate Shirou 10 years to unlock his RM, and this Shirou's already got his.

Fate Shirou, we know will be able to use UBW to its full potential within 20 years. UBW Shirou is far beyond Fate Shirou, and far beyond Archer at this point in his life.<br><br>You're underestimating the guy pretty badly. I mean we know from Nasu that he's supposed to go beyond Archer. It's not stated in what ways exactly, but he's gonna do better.</br></br></br>  <br>It's even more obvious when the whole Master-Servant synergy is brought about. Having a master with ample source of mana or not, being on the same wavelenght or having totally differents strategies in mind.<br>This side of the war take a really big part of the story and is for me a clear attempt at shutting down any try of powerlevel comparison.</br></br>  <br> Archer was able to cast UBW in life. <br>after he got a boost from the pact. <br><br>he got a power up while alive, not after becoming a CG</br></br></br></br>  <br>Q: In Saber Route, Shirou did not encounter Archer's Reality Marble "Unlimited Blade Works" and certainly did not learn it. If he were to train and attempt to develop it by himself, how long would it take?<br><br>A: Ten years to master the basics, another ten years to become proficient at it.<br>... something like that. <br><br>It doesn't matter if it came from the pact or not, we know Shirou is capable of unlocking it and using it proficiently on his own within his own lifetime. UBW Shirou has already got the basics, so he should be pretty solid with it by the time he's in his mid-20s.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did nasu address the same issue regarding HF Shirou?</br>  <br>Unfortunately no. All we have is that if he trains, he should be able to unlock. No time frame on how long it would take.</br>  <br>probably sooner than fate id imagine, since he at least knows he has a reality marble and has seen archers though, he couldn't use it.</br>  Why didn't Lancer disarm Archer 27 times in their second fight?  <br>both were now serious. or her swords break off screen</br>  <br>The anime changed the second fight by quite a bit</br>  <br>It was Lancer's turn to job</br>  <br><br><br>HF Shirou can't summon UBW. He discards it along with his idea of hero of justice. He isn't looking at the same scenery than his counterparts, so he can't reach UBW.<br><br>So unlocking his RM should take him about as long as Fate Shirou, and it wouldn't be UBW.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> HF Shirou can't summon UBW. <br>Shirou can't pull Archer's version of Unlimited Blade Works out of his arm any more than UBW Shirou could access Archer's version of Unlimited Blade Works by watching him invoke it<br>They're different people who have lived different lives, their inner worlds are different. None of Shirous from any route or continuity have the same version of Unlimited Blade Works</br></br></br>  Archer's UBW<br>UBW Shirou's UBW</br>  <br>Fate Shirou's UBW? At least that's the UBW from Last Episode I believe.<br><br>Question would be what HF Shirou's UBW would look like.</br></br></br>  <br>Archer's and UBW Shirou's are so similar however , that Shirou gets to have some sort of control upon the sword in Archer's UBW, and materialize his own version after seeing it a few times and being provided mana by Tohsaka.<br><br>HF Shirou is awesome in all the right ways and my favorite Shirou, but he doesn't have that move, nor show interest in developing it.</br></br></br>  <br>Really? It felt like the most fitting sex scene in all Fate works to me.<br><br> Caren loved Avenger? <br>Her dad is Kotomine Kieri. Is it that surprising that she falls in love with all the evils of the world?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's surprising when the extent of their interaction is;<br> lol u r shit at the organ <br> being a nun sounds shit <br> imma rape you now <br><br>And really? I always felt like HF had the most fitting H scenes. It's why I am absolutely dreading Ufotable's HF. Seeing Sakura sucking Shirou's blood or some dumb shit is going to give me such anal pain.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well that's probably how it's gonna go down. All the versions of FSN they're advertising are the RN version.</br>  <br>Yup</br>  <br> Avenger is under stress <br> he doesn't know how to act around Caren, which makes him even more hostile <br> he makes threats constantly <br> she teases him because she enjoys his pain <br> he snaps and fucks the shit out of her and calms down afterward <br><br>I wouldn't call it rape. It's like she wanted him to do it to relieve himself so she kept tempting him, because he needed it to see clearly. And considering the way she was raised, she probably considered guiding Avenger her job and relieving him is part of that process.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you think Archer is so weak,<br>could Shiki kill Archer?</br></br>  <br> lol u r shit at the organ <br> being a nun sounds shit <br> imma rape you now <br>That's so very japanese.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bow &gt; Knife<br><br><br>Isn't it though? Although neither of them are.<br><br><br>I guess I just didn't pick up on any of that at all until the moment he stripped her down.<br><br>The fact that she was having talons about to burst out of her at any minute made it a lot less sexy, also.<br>I really liked the image of them ascending together, but it was kind of ruined by the earlier scene. Their relationship definitely needed work.<br><br>Also;<br> All these scenes are totally how Shirou would have acted because 0 + 1 = 1 <br> Now I will proceed to bully Caren and sexually assault her : ^ ) <br><br>Okay Nasu</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What does this screen mean?  <br>Need to update to latest version I think.</br>  <br> The fact that she was having talons about to burst out of her at any minute made it a lot less sexy, <br>Are you gay? A nun about to explode while getting fucked like an animal by All the Evils of the World and enjoying it is kinda hot.</br></br>  <br>Fuck. Does it automatically update over Qooapp? I hardly understand how any of this works at all honestly.</br>  <br>Will Sakura and Shirou kiss?</br>  <br>Uninstall it and download and install it again. Even though it says original version on qooapp once you start the game it is updated, at least fo rme.</br>  <br>I am the spider that set this web.-----Welcome to this wonderful killing chamber.</br>  <br>Thank you, anon</br>  This is your departure from this life. You should take a good look at the world you lived in, the world where your regrets will linger.  <br>No he salty because there's more than like 20 people. Because Mesopotamia was a shit hole and the indus valley is where the real nggas were at back then.</br>  <br> dude weed lmao I'm so high xDD <br>Fuck off</br></br>  <br> you'll never see those two broing it up by some strange twist of fate and hunting super monsters <br><br>I'd love to see that just for banter and Archer projecting cool weapons for Shiki to use</br></br></br>  why isn't el cid a servant yet?  <br>HE HATES IT.</br>  <br>Because he beat the shit out of heracles, killing him SIX times. That's something nobody else did in the three route. Well not counting Gilgamesh that killed him completely. <br><br>Saber and Shirou had to get power of plot powerup to finish heracles and in HF Shirou was powered up by ARCHER's arm.<br><br>Also secondary, he sniped the shit out of everyone in HA</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This.<br><br>Put Archer on top of a skyscraper and he becomes fucking top tier.</br></br></br>  <br>Didn't Shirou kill Heracles 9 times with Archer's arm?<br><br>So Archer even outdid himself in a later route.</br></br></br>  <br>It was a corrupted Heracles without his NP</br>  <br>Fuck off, faggot.</br>  yo why the FUCK is this game stuck at 100%  <br>Archer had everything to lose Against Heracles yet he fought and killed him six times. Saber can't do shit Against Heracles melee and she's GODDAMN SABER, Archer is a fucking Archer that's supposed to snipe people and play with tacticts, yet he managed to do more than Saber ever did without Plot power.<br><br>It goes like this<br> Kills berserker 6 times making he regain his lucidness and wish he wasn't insane so that he could fight Archer's swordmanship because it's just fucking Amazing, let's remember again that his class is ARCHER, he wasn't supposed to fight melee against fucking Berserker, he was supposed to snipe and if he did he could've killed him more, fought in bad ground for him and still kicked ass. <br> Did this without using UBW that while Nasu says wouldn't be a big thing against most servants is still a GREAT way of getting a few seconds with swordspam so that he can manage a few batman tactics. And of course gives him free mana projections as long as it's activated. <br>I want to clarify that Nasu says only UBW wouldn't kill servants, it's obviously a different story if the user gets it to work around battle strategies.<br><br> Gave his Arm to Shirou and with that Shirou saved the world, oh and beat motherfucking Berserker. HIS ARM, nobody else's.  <br><br> Sniped everyone in Hollow Ataraxia and made Lancer sleep in the woods for fear of being headshotted. FUCKING LANCER, CU CHULAINN who projectiles are not supposed to work against  <br><br> &gt;Only good at talking trash and threatening other servants as though he is that strong. <br><br>Na fuck off with your shit bait. Secondary shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They did in RN. If they change things up a tad for the movies and not use pure RN, it'll be great.<br><br>Plus, they need to use that new design from GO for her, with her wearing glasses in the HF True epilogue, doing her job as Supervisor. We may even finally see her teacher Dilo, hopefully he is a badass priest, given nearly every church member is.<br><br>And maybe, hope against hope, a mini-story of Shirou and Sakura touring the underground to find Shirou a better body. Maybe these Grand Order cards are from that magic tourney to raise money Rin talked about in True, and she changed her mind. Give Rider a new outfit Sakura, we know you like dressing her up.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sakura is cute as fuck.</br>  <br>Since when were you under the impression that Archer killing Berserker 6 times is itself not plot armor?</br>   I see. Then wait until this is over. I will give her to you after I kill Emiya Shirou. <br>She is mine until then. It cannot be helped if you cannot compromise on that. It will be regrettable, but you will die here, Gilgamesh.<br><br>Archer running his mouth as usual. What if Gilgamesh decided to call his bluff?<br><br>And this Archer without a master, depleted mana and only surviving on independent action.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Archer didn't have anything to lose at that point. His top priority was to fuck Shirou's shit up or die trying.</br>  <br>Yet Gilgamesh king of heroes went out of his way to kill this "Faker" by backstabbing him. Oh and he fucking failed.<br>Same Gilgamesh that isn't supposed to take "Mongrels" seriously, backstabbing one of those "Mongrels" because of FEAR.<br><br>King of shitters</br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw Shielder this whole opening <br><br>jesus christ she's doing strange things for my heart and dick</br></br></br>  Anybody else terrified about the HF film?<br><br>UBW was good, but it's a whole different thing to HF. I literaly cannot see this adaptation going well.</br></br>  <br> UBW was good <br>Yeah it wasn't a good adaptation. <br><br> Anybody else terrified about the HF film? <br>And yes I am. If they try doing it in a few movies it will be guaranteed shit. <br>HF is the longest of all the routes and the best of them all, doing it in 1-3 movies will cut the story in half and feel rushed as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I feel like UBW was a fair adaptation. What, aside from Archer vs Shirou, wasn't good?</br>  <br> Yeah it wasn't a good adaptation.  <br><br>It was an amazing adaptation. I have no clue what I could have wanted more with it.</br></br></br>  <br>Because he died. It's Shirou's plot armor.</br>  <br>I think he could easily murder all masters, but he knows the whole thing is fucked and you can't actually win</br>  <br>It's funny he himself admits he isn't even close yet you see EMIYAfags trying to argue he can beat Lancelot. He might have a chance, but that chance is as small as the chance Cu would have against Heracles.</br>  <br> Cu against Heracles <br>MUH RUNES</br></br>  Fate/Stay Night is a gateway visual novel of the worst kind. It's a bad VN, a clusterfuck of story and characterization that isn't very well done by any aspect, but which attempts to compensate for its weaknesses by adding in excessive powerlevel faggotry and DARKNESS. The normal anon can see this as the shit it is, and may enjoy it, hate it or be indifferent to it, but all the while recognizing that the VN itself, regardless of their opinion, is plain bad.<br><br>However, these very aspects that try to smear over the shit of its core make it a breeding ground for aspie, unsociable underageb&amp; faggots who engage in every kind of faggotry both online and in the real world. The superpowered characters all trying their hardest to look cool, the Noble Phantasms, ridiculous, color-coded clothes, the whole Servant faggotry and everything about the Fate/Stay Night world fuels their escapist fantasies, while the pity-party character backgrounds, emphasis on heroism, and overall chuuni tone of the VN makes it fit just right with the mary-sueish drives of your average preteen and his sense of unwarranted self-importance towards the world. Exactly the kind of shit that makes little kiddies and underageb&amp; retards eat this shit right the fuck up.<br><br>Fate/Stay Night is basically THE series to attract the most hated VN fanbase known to /a/, which is why, regardless of individual opinions, it is the responsibility of every anon to troll the fuck out of this show and everyone who likes it, and ensure that no Fate/Stay Night threads ever encourage the newfriends to show their faces here.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Mostly Shirou. The story goes around him, if you fuck him up then it just doesn't feel good now does it. The fact that in the end of season 1 he looked like a retard making it his fault for Saber being captured was retarded. Also a personal preference is that they shouldn't have cut the <br> If she is going to move and put Fuji-nee in danger <br> I will _____ Tohsaka <br><br>Medea's master, Illya's backstory. <br>Cutting stuff and adding anime original wasn't needed. <br>Now about Shirou again:<br>The monologues are needed and no 1 episode(after Illya's death) showing Shirou being a retard doesn't explain well to animeonly that he's a retard, you can notice that when Animeonlyfags still don't get what Shirou's problem is. VN readers think this is enough because they already know it but it isn't. My cousin watched it with me and then read the VN when it ended, he went from "this dude is annoying" to "this dude is fucked in the head"<br> <br>Archer vs Shirou is one of the key moments if not THE key moment so it being bad doesn't help either. <br><br>Bad OST, or should I say the OST wasn't there in the moments it should? Dunno how to explain. <br><br>All in all it wasn't bad, but it was mediocre when it could've been much better if they explained shit. <br><br>Oh another personal preference, making as if Gil survived on his own against Shirou when th grail actually saved him from being beheaded was just pandering to Gilfags</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's no way you are gettin me down in that cellar until this thread is fortified so those things can't get in!</br>  <br>so pic related is Archer?</br>  <br>MUHRUNES DAGON</br>  <br>Pandering to Gilfags is neccessary, with FZ fans coming in. The whiplash as they see his character here is still delicious.<br><br>The OST is indeed as bland as most Kaijura stuff is, without any hits like The Battle Is To The Strong. Though I have to say, listening to the OST alone, some songs seemed really good, but I don't remember them from the show at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Hey, never underestimate dead parents!</br>    <br>That utter look of disgust.<br><br> went full bara </br></br></br>  <br>Oh Jesus. I love the complaint of "monologues".<br><br>What monologues. What was missing. You can't just say they should have added monologues without pinpointing what was wrong. Did you want them to just fucking narrate everything? There's a point where you have to realize this is not a book. It's a visual medium. Where didn't they get Shirou's characterization right? Because Nasu's gone on record outright saying the anime is closer to his original vision. If that's the case, you have to start questioning things.<br><br><br> Medea's master, Illya's backstory. <br> Cutting stuff and adding anime original wasn't needed.  <br><br>They gave a character who has a massive presence in UBW a fleshed out backstory, and they did the absolute best they could with Ilya. They connected her story to Zero out of necessity. There was no Fate route to connect the character to the viewers, so they conncted her to Zero, and had sympathy be drawn from her being Kerry's daughter. <br><br> Archer vs Shirou is one of the key moments if not THE key moment so it being bad doesn't help either.  <br><br>Love the consensus here that it was just "bad". What was wrong with it? You gonna bring up giant swords? Get mad that they had the big climactic battle of UBW, in UBW?<br><br> Bad OST, or should I say the OST wasn't there in the moments it should? Dunno how to explain.  <br><br>The OST was written in an entirely different way than your typical anime, so it may seem jarring to you, but it was actually on a pure technical level an achievement. Fukasawa wrote over 400 compositions to the series and gave original music to almost every scene instead of reusing tracks.<br><br>One legitimate complaint is that the music was mixed quieter in the broadcast version. Have you watched the BD episodes?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This does things to my dick.</br>  <br>I can see why she needs such a large shield to protect her from damage. She is almost naked</br>  <br>The whiplash when they see him getting rekt by Sakura in 2 seconds will be better. Also pretty much off-panel. <br><br>Actually that is one of the things I love about HF. It takes everything you know about the war and servants and then just shits on it making things go in a totally different way that nobody would have expected unless they had been spoiled.<br>It's just awesome</br></br></br></br>  <br> Lancelot is a terrible example, he's a super human in a world of super humans; not someone who needs to play it smooth with tactics and knowledge to find a path. <br>Problem is Lancelot skillset allows him to do just that, he can do both keikaku and brute force extremely well. I guess Lancelot is more of a Dr Doom without Magic then?</br></br>  <br>That's only because he is a nerfed shirou, shirou would wreck any servant with ease.</br>  <br> That's something nobody else did in the three route <br>Because almost no one actually fought Berserker, you nut.<br><br>And it was done because of a bunch of A rank NPs that likely ran out, because of single rank downgrades.<br><br>Saber kills Berserker with Caliburn.<br>Gilgamesh kills Berserker with his assortment of A rank NPs.<br>Saber ALTER killed around several as well with one Excaliblast.<br><br>That's a shitty fucking argument. And Dark Berserker had no skin and was dying in HF.<br><br>Saber couldn't do anything because she was shit powered in FSN until Rin becomes her Master or Sakura becomes her Master.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Because Nasu's gone on record outright saying the anime is closer to his original vision. If that's the case, you have to start questioning things. <br><br> This is getting me loads of money I will go and say Miura fucked my MC up because i'm retarded xDD - Kinoku Nasu <br><br>You're dumb</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Counter Guardian <br>That's just another type of hero</br></br>  <br> would wreck any servant with ease. <br>Since Nasu said Shiki wins against Shirou, that means Shiki wins against Servants as well, especially after he said MEoDP works against Servants.<br><br> people not understanding that almost every win in FSN was done through situational advantages </br></br></br></br>  <br> Saber kills Berserker with Caliburn <br><br>Saber and Shirou with the power of plot. Ehm, "Miracles" Fuck off. <br><br>Rank downgrades mean shit to Archer because he can break them, there's a reason Berserker who is known for not giving a fuck about attacks dodging Caladbolg II when he sensed it was going to blow him up. <br><br> Saber Alter <br>OH FUCKING SURPRISE, the servant with a master capable of killing Gilgamesh an instant is strong!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't agree with Nasu, so you just say he's lying. That's great.<br><br>You randomly brought up Miura as a boogieman though, so I'm guessing you're one of those dudes from MAL who got super mad that they didn't just put the VN on screen for 23 minutes every week.</br></br></br>  <br> Because Nasu's gone on record outright saying the anime is closer to his original vision. If that's the case, you have to start questioning things. <br>Nasu's a hack, though.</br></br>  <br>It goes like this. <br><br>Shiki Tohno&gt;Shirou but dies after killing him. Why? Overload MEoDP<br><br>Shiki NANAYA&gt;Some servants because his Nanaya blood kicks in making him move near Arcueid levels(she's till faster than him, but that doesn't make him slow) that is something no servant cand do. <br>The fact that he's hellish fast and that his attacks will always kill you means he will end things in a speedblitz.<br>Also reminder that Nanaya is an Assassin, if he needs to killsomeone he will backstab them before they even know what happened</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Breaking shit takes time, around half a minute at the easiest one to break. You can't spam that shit and its only single use.</br>  Hey guys, does anyone have that list of Knights of the Rounds who get Excaliburs and who and who cannot Excaliblast?  <br> He's saying things right, let's call him MALfag <br><br>Fuck off. You're retarded if you can't tell he or anyone else will never ever say the adaptation is bad, fuck not even Ishida Sui said TG adaptation was bad, what's wrong with you people. <br><br>Also you're just putting things in my mouth I never said, I never said anything about putting all the monologues and the VN word by word, stop being a fucking retard. <br>They showing a bit of Shirou's mind in every episode until that point would help explain WHY he is like that.<br><br>Also ignore the fact that animeonly fags still don't understand Shirou's abilities or his personality.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> wish he wasn't insane so that he could fight Archer's swordmanship because it's just fucking Amazing <br>Same guy who got stomped by Cu at close combat.<br><br> FUCKING LANCER, CU CHULAINN who projectiles are not supposed to work against  <br>Long range projectiles and shit with AoE does work on him, guess what EMIYA has.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes and Archer is not supposed to fight in Melee, Yet he managed to kill heracles SIX times. <br><br>Stop ignoring feats you mongoloid. What do you think would have happened if Archer fought in his usual style? he probably would've killed him a couple more times.</br></br></br>  <br>Second paragraph, Nasu's statement. These are his words. He thinks the anime got it closer. You can disagree, but just saying "he's lying" doesn't really work as an argument, buddy.<br><br>I wasn't trying to put things in your mouth. I wanted to know, what did you want? "Monologues" is not an argument. What parts were missing? What scenes?<br><br>Frankly I don't think they really missed anything. You just saying anime only people "didn't get it" is anecdotal and pointless. If you pay attention it's all there. They just didn't dumb it down for people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yet he managed to kill heracles SIX times. <br>This shows Heracles is a fucking shit at close combat as a Berserker. The only reason why he is even a threat is God Hand. Killed 6 times by someone who got stomped by Cu and would have died if he had not fought him before.</br></br>  <br>EMIYA fighting how he's supposed to &gt; Cu Chulainn. <br><br> Same guy who got stomped by Cu at close combat <br>You mean the mad berserker that wished he was sane so he could actully FIGHT at close combat instead of swing a giant rock like a fucking retard? <br><br>Oh you're so intelligent anon, of course he got toyed by Cu, Cu is better than Archer at Melee, that doesn't make Archer weaker since he is an ARCHER.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But you're ignoring the fact that LUCID, NOT CRAZY Heracles said he wished he was LUCID AND NOT CRAZY so that he could Fight Archer's amazing swordsmanship. <br><br>If fucking Heracles recognizes you as being a fucking great swordsman then hell yeah you are.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure swordmanship means close combat though.</br>  <br>Oh so you're baiting, nice anon.</br>  <br> EMIYA fighting how he's supposed to <br>Protection from Arrows<br>Servant Speed<br> :^) </br></br></br></br>  <br>EMIYAfags, everyone. Sure, if you consider basic grammar to be bait, then there is nothing to argue here.</br>  <br> This much Heresy <br>I'm going to need to Exterminatus your shit taste.</br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>That still won't protect her from my dick though.</br>  <br> If fucking Heracles recognizes you as being a fucking great swordsman then hell yeah you are. <br>Doesn't seem to be that way considering the one he believe to have "amazing swordmanship" got BTFO by another Servant, and Cu, as good as he might be, is not even the best of his era, he is most likely just average.</br></br>    <br>Please tell me it's happening.</br>  <br> yfw that's genderswapped Hitler </br>  I'm guessing FGO is out? Region locked most likely.  <br>Just download it off QooApp, it works outside of Nipland.</br>  <br> Not knowing about based Nobunaga Oda <br> The one who can one-shot Gilgamesh, Heracles, and Cu Chulain. </br></br>  <br> Nobu (ノッブ, Nobbu?) is her given nickname in Fate/GUDAGUDA Order. It is pointed out if 100 million users has registered in Fate/Grand Order, she and Sakura Saber would make an appearance. </br>  <br> Wormslut received a card before Scáthach did </br>  FSN is shit, to be honest. I like the idea but the routes are too clean and streamlined, there is no chaos and characters are conveniently offed anti-climatically for the sake of "the route". All the climaxes feel too easy and straightforward because all of them turn into easypeasy 1-on-1 hero versus antagonists battles. Not saying Nasu is a better writer or whatever, but Zero hard the right by being much messier and having a lot of subplots running parallel at the same time. Not to mention that the climax has basically a 4 way battle.  <br>But can servants beat Gai who is recognized by Madara as the strongest?</br>  <br>I thought it was common knowledge that Rocks and Taijutsu &gt; Uchihas.<br> At least that's what I read in powerlevel threads/ </br></br>  <br>ok</br>  <br> more characters fighting at once means better <br> ignoring all the bits like Rin vs Caster, Shirou vs Kuzuki, Archer vs Lancer, or a ton of other examples <br><br>ok</br></br></br></br>  <br>That all happens too early and the "extra" characters are conveniently killed off to leave room for straightforward final battles like Shirou/Saber vs Kotomine/Gil, Shirou/Gil or Shirou/Kotomine non-shit edition.</br>  <br><br><br>What are these pics from?</br></br></br>  <br>F/GO opening I think.</br>  <br>In UBW alone there are like, three different things going on during the finale. Shirou vs Gil, Saber vs Assassin, and Rin getting Shinji out of the grail.<br><br>Likewise I think HF has two? Rin dealing with Sakura, and Shirou vs Kirei. It certainly isn't all one on one.</br></br></br>  Someone made a cool personal drawthread but it was deleted for some reason, so I decided to make my own! Request anyone!

Very nice work, I hope you had fun drawing him. <br><br>Have a great weekend!</br></br></br>  <br> This <br> big breast <br>Shameful.</br></br></br>  <br>Being a horrible drawer is hard.

I just use VLC when I need to. Its something in the settings of MPC that is fucking it up.</br>   Less than 24 hours to go <br><br>Are your bodies ready?</br></br>  Hibiki's clearly wasn't  <br>I want another suplex at some point.</br>  <br> only just watched episode 4 today <br>Fuck, it's Friday already?<br> Songs fucking when? </br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah she has that problem sometimes</br></br>  <br><br> Yeesh what's with the face, Miku? <br><br> You'd think someone died or something. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>She'll walk it off, right guys?</br></br></br>  <br>It took me about 3 minutes to find it without knowing the sauce, you can do it anon.</br>  <br>After I first saw it, I would say yes, but she made that face during her fall and didn't move an inch.<br>She's fucking dead until at least episode 7.<br> captcha: prams <br>What the actual fuck is a pram?</br></br></br></br>  Is it Friday yet?  <br> What the actual fuck is a pram? <br>baby stroller</br></br>    <br>British for a baby stroller  I think </br>  <br> dem Brits <br>Fucking testing me on my real world knowledge some more google, I dare you.</br></br>  <br> at one point in the series, in one scene, it seems like she's about to fall in the dark side like in S2. Like she's in a deep darkness, like it'd make you go "Huh? What's up with this girl?". She might or might not going to get into a dangerous situation, and then when she's saved, her smile might or might not make you go "Huh? Is that okay? Huh?", or something like that. <br> Miku will definitely won't fall into darkness, she's just sincerely thinking about Hibiki. That said, she's gonna call out her hidden side and fool around a little bit. <br>Calling it now, Hibiki is going to die or go into magic coma and Miku is going to go to the dark side or do some other fucked up thing to get Hibiki back.</br></br></br>          <br><br>Why didn't they kiss</br></br>  Miku Miku Miku  <br><br> Low resolution piss poor quality facebook images <br>Stop that.</br></br></br>  <br>IS IT FRIDAY ALREADY?<br><br>HOLY SHIT.</br></br></br>  <br>I do not know me too I want</br>  <br>I wonder if her gear is actually just dormant inside her now. Like there's an unerasable core. I mean, why would Ver make a gear that can destroy itself with it's own beam?<br><br>Then again, it is Ver. <br><br>https://d.maxfile.ro/hpbbtgerat.web<wbr>m<br><br>I still don't know if he's extremely competent or extremely imcompetent.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  I just want Hibiki to wake up perfectly fine and say something like  "Oh, hey Miku. Where am I? That concert was a blast, we must go together next time. I'm starting to like those Zwei Wing girls!     <br><br>This kills the Miku</br></br>  How will the thread react if Garie is first to kill? since she seems very famous in /a/ so far(unless i get it wrong)  <br>I'm still upset this exists.</br>  <br> Garie is first to kill <br>Since this is /a/ I'm not sure if you mean first to kill someone or first to die.</br></br>  <br><br>The picture or the mousepad?</br></br>  <br>I doubt we'll be seeing the Shen Shou Jing again. In fact I hope we don't. Mikugear was awesome and I don't dislike the idea of more Miku singing scary love songs while blowing shit up with lasers, but I'm with Kaneko on this one, Miku was not made to be a permanent gear. It's better to have it as that one time thing that was awesome.</br>  Is it Friday yet?  <br>Mousepad.</br>  <br>I mean first to die</br>  <br>On one hand I like Gary, she's cool.<br><br>On the other hand, Gariefags are starting to get annoying so I wouldn't mind seeing some tears.</br></br></br>    <br><br>Eh, fair enough.<br><br>Would it have been better or worse if it had been one of the other Symphogears, though?<br><br><br><br>You're fooling yourself<br><br>They Gary-fags would rage and cry, yes, but then they'd all just become Micah-fags<br><br>Do you really want that instead?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop it I'm trying to forget I ever read that.</br>  Is it airing at 3:10 like normal or is it delayed again?    <br><br><br>Could be worse<br><br>Imagine if Tsubasa walked in and Hibiki started fangirling over her and  asking if she could get Kanade's autograph </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>STOP</br>  Who DMJii here?  Exterminate is a shit song. Rebirth-day is better.  <br>3:10 like normal.</br>  I will post this every thread until it's back.    <br><br>It was already posted you fucking idiot:<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>It's only gay when the butts touch.</br>  <br><br>Someone pls fix the text in this, Give it a white border or something.</br></br>    <br>Is that how to make lesbian girls straight? needs more spider webs</br>    <br>I feel like we should get to know you more TsubaChris-kun. I mean you are going to be in every Symphogear thread posting that same image until the end of time after all.</br>  <br>Best.</br>  <br>Season 3 is shit, right?<br> I never watch this season. </br></br>    <br><br>You will never sleep between them as they warm their ice-cold feet on your body</br></br>  <br><br>Why is Miku wearing Hibiki's undies?</br></br>  Chris a best, Tsubasa a shit, Hibiki a lame  <br>Maria's only useful for that.</br>  <br>That scene was so heart-boner warming, Maria has to be some amazing cuddle material.</br>  <br>I'd say it's first 4 episodes were the best of any season so far.</br>  <br>I want to see Miku kiss Hibiki's scare on her check.<br><br><br>I want this to stop being asked every thread.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The original author is in full control of the story again, take a guess.</br>  <br>They sleep in the same bed and bathe together, I don't think sharing underwear means anything with them.</br>  <br>True I had not noticed</br>  <br><br>What? I always thought anime turns shit after season 2. <br>Downloading this, thanks.</br></br></br>  <br><br> one toothbrush <br><br>what.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Guess where the other one is.</br>  <br>You posted the wrong one.</br>  <br><br>Dammit Hibiki put on a bra<br><br>Your back is going to ache</br></br></br></br>  <br>Would Sonicare react with her gear?</br>  <br>But she's not Chris</br>  <br>I'm still mad the roaches don't crawl inside the eyes again from her mouth so it loops perfectly</br>  <br>It's a fucking crime that the artist went with Miku instead of the obvious choice.</br>  <br>Bikkiebutt belongs to Miku and Miku only so she had to contribute with hers.</br>  to say who wants look at this  <br>Is this a yuri anime like kancolle?</br>  <br><br>mah niggas</br></br>  What if Bikki's sudden bitching wasn't caused by her own insecurities but by Carol's attack in episode 2? <br><br>If Gungnir didn't respond to her because she forgot what she's fighting for, it could mean that Carol's attack kind of "removed" her memories in a certain way.</br></br>  <br>It's closer to Nanoha levels of gay. Missing a daughter though.</br>  <br>Can you stop dumping pics from fucking Facebook?</br>  <br>The loli can still be adopted</br>  <br> Missing a daughter though <br>They will adopt Carol and Eruefuru.</br></br>  <br>The loli is obviously for Chris since they decided to ship TsubaMari and Chris has always gotten around.<br><br><br>We can only hope it happens in S3 like it did in Nanoha.</br></br></br></br>  <br> We can only hope it happens in S3 <br> hope it happens in S3 <br> in S3 <br> S3 <br>Anon...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> sexually fuck </br>  <br>What?</br>  <br> Chris has always gotten around. <br>Rude.</br></br>  Hibiki is the manliest  <br>I don't see how someone as adaptable as Chris wouldn't get around. She seems well liked by everyone and if you're surrounded by flowers you will want to sniff and/or pluck them all.</br>   Chris was fine with Kirika and Shirabe PDA <br> the moment Hibiki and Miku started she panicked and shut it down </br>  <br>Because no one cares about DMJii, duh</br>  <br> that banding </br>  <br>DMJii are cute little girls holding hands.<br><br>Miku and Hibiki exhibit degenerate lesbian behavior. Chris has spent enough time around them to know exactly how gay they can get.</br></br></br>     No one posting best girl Chris   <br>You aren't supposed to hold hands in public until you're married.</br>  Friendly reminder that Miku saw Chris naked first before anyone else  Besides dozen of older men and probably women too  when she nursed her back to health.  <br>Hibiki will fall into a magic coma and Miku will work for some white-haired evil shota to bring her back even if it means fighting her friends.<br><br> Rewatching Mai Otome felt good. It was actually better than I remembered. </br></br></br>    <br>Or she starts wearing Miko clothes and tries to summon a mecha from the moon named after a legendary japanese sword together with Ogawa who is actually an Orochi.</br>  <br>She's so crosseyed.</br>  <br>I want to fuck Chris silly</br>  <br>Why are you forgetting Fine?</br>    <br>Isn't it fine to forget about Finé, she was more of a pimp to Chris. Not a potential yuri mating partner.</br>  So non-meme subs never?  <br>An anon mentioned in the last thread that H&amp;D's main... translator? Something, someone important to H&amp;D subs at least, is on vacation atm<br><br>no idea if it's true, but it seems plausible</br></br></br>  <br><br>Which one is BB?</br></br>  <br>While I think that wanting to do that shows that you're still alive because every breathing male would do that I still have to tell you that she already is silly. And crazy.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, Zoid is at Wonfes, so ep 4 is delayed.</br></br>  <br>I want to shove my dick between Hibiki's thighs.</br>  Is it Friday yet?  <br>12 hours and about 10 more minutes anon.</br>  <br>yes<br><br>now go back to sleep kirika, it's past your bedtime</br></br></br>  <br><br>I didn't care for Kiri last season but Damn has she gotten a lot better</br></br>  <br><br>Death</br></br>   Episode 5 <br>Is it going to happen again?</br>  <br>She was already a sexy little piece of work last season.</br>  Best pair:  Kirika's stripey socks     12 hours guys  No delay this week?    <br><br>Thumbnail looks like she had four arms.</br></br>  <br><br>She was pretty much Hibiki with different hair. I blame my recent attraction on the flood of good fan art and a delicious transformation sequence, things she lacked last season.</br></br>  <br>Garie and Micha have a lot of fan art together even though they were shown later than Phara and Lieur.</br>  <br>Because the latter are pretty lame.</br>  <br><br>They still have time to redeem themselves, but I doubt they can. Micha and Garie are Team Fun, Leiur and Phara are Team Serious, so it's obvious who's better.</br></br>  <br>Smug onee-chan and loli imouto make a great pair</br>  <br><br>Phara is fun in a way.</br></br>    <br>Why?</br>  So I just finished rewatching S1 for the first time since G aired. It literally brought me to tears three different times, and this moment caused me to "Fuck Yeah" hard enough to make my neighbors dog start barking.<br><br>We really don't deserve something this fantastic. How can one anime be so completely BASED?<br><br>Also, dat Aoi scream.</br></br></br></br>  <br>wont you drink Kirika's period blood every morning like Shirabe does? If you truly love her then you would do it too.</br>  That attack directly impacted Gungnir, shattering it and sending a shard into Hibiki's heart again. This time a shard of Micha's sword crystal thing also pierced her heart, so she's a Human/Relic/Alchemy hybrid.<br>Make it happen.</br>    <br>But Micha is my waifu</br>  <br> Less than 24 hours to go <br>My happiness is completely charged!</br></br>  Finally started season 3 i have 3 more episodes. Should i just marathon them before the new ep comes out?  <br>Hopefully they don't become too evil. I like them but I won't if they kill anyone other than nameless people.</br>  <br>Lieur has a megadeus that she can apparently materialize at will, she's anything but lame.</br>  <br>Hibiki will get up and go berserk, and rather than be concerned, Miku will smile and tell Hibiki to just murder the dolls.</br>  <br>Do it! Then you can livewatch with us tomorrow and join in on the discussion. Also, you'll love where this season is going. Definitely go for it!</br>  <br> Hopefully they don't become too evil. <br>Garie massacred a shit ton of people. She's beyond redeemable.</br></br>  <br>Leiur vs Chris<br>Phara vs Sword<br>Micha vs DMJii<br>Garie vs Maria<br>Bikki vs Carol<br><br>What would you do if it's Leiur's giant vs  motherfuckin' Genjurou  in a ship throwing contest  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> i <br><br><br>Perfection doesn't need to be redeemed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>your S1 character song &gt; the later ones</br>  <br>Rainbow Flower &gt; all.</br>  <br>Rainbow Flower wasn't in season 1, doofus.</br>  <br> Zenbu &gt; Rainbow Flower &gt; * <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br>I'd be cute about it, catch it in a glass and drop in a celery stick. Because I don't need bloody Maria for that.</br>  i miss it when chris used to say "bang" in her transormation sequence<br><br><br> inb4 i was just <br> pretending to be retarded guise i swear!</br></br></br></br>  does anyone have a tampon tea fetish?<br> because I don't </br>  <br>Me too. Chris' G transformation is the best in the entire franchise.</br>  <br>I miss it when people used to use their shift key.</br>  What's this I've been hearing about swimming?<br>It won't affect Symphogear right?</br>  <br>Will streamer still have time to play symphogear song to increase hype?</br>  <br>  27:10 MBS 戦姫絶唱シンフォギアGX #01 <br>From Yucie's page, but may be not updated</br></br>  <br>But that's Mikugeah</br>  <br><br> There's no way she can lose! <br> Gets rekt <br> Comes back <br> It's impossible for her to lose! <br> Gets rekt again <br><br>deconstruction of the main character</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   me started to watch first season a few months ago <br> was fun and all but it got too serious and gritty halfway and I ended up dropping after episode 9 <br> decided to check a bit the final fight  <br> FUCKING EXPLOSIONS, NAKAMA POWER AND ANGEL FORMS <br> mfw <br><br>I regret dropping it and I downloaded it again.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that smug shark tooth grin, I love it so much</br>  hola quien habla español    Why does like everyone shit Hibiki just because she wants to help people? Also beef stroganoff song a best  <br>Fuck off Pablo</br>  <br>Its just a bunch of faggots that don't believe in Justice.</br>  <br>i meant like in the show</br>  <br> facebook shit </br>  Does Hibiki not care about men in their 20s? She hardly even reacts to their bodies.<br>Why doesn't she want to save them?<br>They're basically us. Wouldn't she want to save us?</br></br>  <br> Not being a little girl </br>  Why do you so love Synphogear?  <br>Because I love Nana, and I love the dumb fun and singing this show provides.</br>  <br>Beef Stroganoff and manly Bikki</br>  <br><br>Bras don't prevent back pain, they cause it.</br></br>  <br>There's no tag for heartpupils on the panda. C'mon, help me out.</br>  <br>Got hooked on S1, thought there was an interesting relationship developing between Mikku and Hibiki. Catchy songs, too. Kinda lagged for the first parts of S2, at least until Miku got into danger again.</br>  I know I'm late as fuck but<br> failing to get 128777777 <br>Shame on you all. Its like you aren't thankful for Symphogear.</br></br>  <br> best dancer <br> best poser <br> best girl is fate rival <br> fucking shit up with goddamn coins <br> summons a creepy ass giant stand that throws ships at you <br> lame <br>Seems like everyone's obsessed with Garie but I want to see more of Leiur instead.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Meant for </br>  <br>She's like what Michael Jackson would be if he was a woman, instead of a dead pedophile. They both deflected bullets with dance moves.</br>  <br>I would love her if she wasn't ugly as fuck. She's like a middle-aged chain-smoker wearing a chastity belt.<br><br>Also breakdancing is shit-tier.</br></br></br>  Carol's VA is so young.  <br>Dead ALLEGED pedophile. Also don't forget that they're both bad. Really, really bad.</br>  Zoid posted some Sympho photos from Thomas Romain's Artbook.    <br>No Gary?</br>    <br>Is this Kadingir?<br><br>Garie's VA is still new as fuck and no one knows when she was born yet.</br></br></br>  <br> there's an English translation <br>Damn man. I wish I had that.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Looks like Babylonia's Treasury from where the Noise came from.</br></br></br>  <br>Sometimes I forget how old Nana is. It's great that she's able to put so much energy into her roles and songs despite being an old hag.</br>          Just finished watching first season a few hours ago. It was pretty good. I expected something like vividred operation but I got moe Bruce Lee instead. Is it explained why this guy can do all that crazy shit? Is it just superior martial arts and I should turn my brain off?    <br> Is it explained why this guy can do all that crazy shit? <br>He eats, sleeps, and watches action movies.<br>What more is there to say?</br></br></br>  <br>He's a true man.</br>        <br><br><br>Well, how embarrasing. I forgot it was already explained in the show.</br></br></br>    H&amp;D WHEN?    <br>It seems like a train wreak but it really is multi-track drifting.</br>  <br>I think they're plenty stylish. don't tell me you didn't like the flamenco swordplay</br>  <br> Dess <br>ftfy</br></br>  Im gonna be a pleb here and ask, what anime is this?    <br>Not pleb; brain-dead retard.</br>  <br>I can't for the life of me recall where this place is.</br>  <br>Boku no Nana</br>  <br>You have gotten my hopes up and they will probably never be fulfilled but I still thank you anon.</br>  GO GO DESU  <br>I don't think they've used that place.</br>  <br>boner simulator: the animation</br>  <br>Look at the title of the thread.</br>  <br> be me <br> be newfag </br></br>  <br>Fuck off and get out.</br>  <br>The worst part is that we got 128777776 and 128777778</br>   tfw no Genjuro t-shirt with pink tie in pocket print   Threadly reminder that Hajimari no Uta (Babel) is the best Symphosong of all times and will never be topped.  <br>It's over, Carol won.<br>The miracles are dead.</br></br>  <br>You just need to get a red long sleeve shirt and pink tie so you can truly get into the father figure role.</br>  <br>I have both already.</br>  <br>Go to bed Carol, you're not going to grow anymore if you don't get a full nights sleep at your age.</br>  <br>Ok, now get out there and adopt/train small girls to punch and shoot things!</br>  <br>I hope nobody lets her sleep ever again in that case.</br>  So it's finally FIS time to save the world?  <br>Carol go to bed.</br>  <br>If Carol were real and posting on /a/ would you really tell her to go away?

The Homunculus keyword mentions that Carol rejected Elfnein on the grounds that she lacks the mole beneath her eye.</br>  <br>Genjuuro and Ogawa aren't on the sub at night. She can talk to Fujitaka and Aoi in the bridge.</br>  <br>Genjuuro doesn't stay up all night, he gets a full 8 hours for maximum man energy.</br>  Maria &gt; Chris<br>I'm so glad Tsubasa saw the same as well.</br>  <br>I wish both Maria and Tsubasa would get killed off already.</br>  <br> baiting for fanbase wars <br>No, anon, Maria and Chris are both great.</br></br>  <br>Maria is nowhere near as likeable or cute or fluffy or young or good.</br>  Why is Hibiki so manly?  <br> Maria <br>Me too.<br> Tsubasa <br>Do you want the franchise to die as well?</br></br></br></br>  RADIANT FORCE<br>FUCKING WHEN?</br>  <br><br>Stop it, Maria and Chris are both loveable.<br> I prefer that pairing though. </br></br></br>  Chris' new song is fucking weird.<br>Ayahi (and Chris) can sing; so what's with the babyish wailing?</br>  <br><br>Which one of them?<br>Rebirth-day is great.</br></br></br>  <br>Maria is cuter though not as fluffy but she is cuter.<br> young or good <br>age has no merit plus Chris' pussy is probably so beat up, battered and loose you can't really enjoy it anymore.

You have been fighting these enemies for a long time now, if what you say is true, and my alca-noise are only as strong as regular noise, why is your symphogear destroyed now?"<br>The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped her chalk and CD copy of Godfather Love Theme. She stormed out of the room crying those Idol-Hero crocodile tears. The same tears Idols cry for the “victims” (who even today still participate in witch hunts) when they jealously try to claw justly earned revenge away from the miracle killers. <br>There is no doubt that at this point our professor, Tsubasa, wished she had never lost to the alca-noise and become more than swordless sentinel who can only boast about Hibike’s strength. She wished so much that she had some kind of weapon to use, but she herself had lost it in her carelessness. The students applauded and all accepted the evilness of miracles and offered their memories to fuel Micha. An eagle named "Garie" flew into the room and kissed Micha in front of everybody.

All of them made sense to me except for Brook, which Oda said would be a detective. Does anyone know why? Is it just because he's really really old?  <br>Why would a Yonkou join a supernova? It'd be the other way around if anything. I honestly think Kaido's just going to leave without a fuss anyway; he doesn't seem to fight every person he sees, as seen when he was talking in a friendly manner with Urogue.</br>  Why is no one excited for seeing Law's crew? They're on Zou, right? I figure the Penguin and Shachi fags would be all over that.  <br>so he can spy for naked women yohohoho</br>  <br>it's written in katakana you fucking rube</br>  <br>I could see Brook being a slapstick detective.</br>  <br>He's fairly inquisitive I suppose.</br>  <br>Kaido scared the homosexuals away for now.</br>  <br>Why wouldn't Sanji still be a chef and Chopper still be a doctor?</br>  <br>He has the ability to fly around as a soul, he can shift through walls he's a great detective.</br>  <br>Reindeer can't be doctors.</br>  <br>I think that was a sport one now that I think of it.<br><br>He can also play dead if he's about to get caught</br></br></br>  Kaido is basically a weakling who only got where he his due to immortality. <br><br>Whitebeard probably fucked his ass multiple times back in the day.</br></br>  <br>That word is often written in katakana</br>  <br>  </br>    <br>He probably told Whitebeard that his little quakes tickled him.</br>  <br>so then its ambiguous then<br><br>Zoo makes more sense than Elephant</br></br></br>  What if  they don't even fight? Kaidou just apologizes and leaves.   <br>Sanji was a chef because Zeff is a chef<br><br>on his own, he'd be a Hair Stylist</br></br></br>  <br>What I'm hoping happens is that the Kid alliance get extremely intimidated by Kaidou's presence, with them starting to sweat from the fear and feeling Kaidou's ''aura'' or whatever. Then Kaidou notices them there, then walks away muttering to himself about not-dying things, and Kid collapses to the floor.  Then they decide to pussy out and not fight Shanks, since they witnessed a Yonkou up close. </br>  <br>That would be way too lame.</br>  <br> Kidd's legs spread open <br>And I thought Law was the slut here.</br></br>  <br>What were the rest?</br>  <br><br><br><br>It's Zou. Elephant. Zoo in katakana would be ズー, or zuu. It's a fucking name of an island. It's as relevant as "Cocoyasi Village", "Little Garden", "Jaya", and "Amazon Lily".

I don't need to provide a source of how a simple sounding word would be written in katakana; it's you who has to provice source on why it wouldn't spelled like that.

Who translated that to Odz is as much as a dumbass as you.<br><br>How much a fucking dense dumbass can you be? Someone else already explained why it's elephant.

Not interested in your opinion</br></br></br>  <br>I mainly think that he is Nurarihyon because of his alias hundred beasts Kaidou. The parade of hundred youkai is led by that guy and Kaidou seems to be linked to Wano.</br>  <br>I'd tell you I think it would look a little strange but I wouldn't be entirely against it or anything considering how used to Oda design fuckery I am at this point.</br>  <br>he still have to develop the villanest of them all, the world goverment.</br>  <br><br>Whitebeard should better be the one who left that scar on his side.</br></br>  <br>Stop it anon. Your stupidity is so dense that I'm getting embarrassed for you.</br>  <br>Anyone else thinking that Kaido has no fruit at all?</br>  <br>Spelling it as Zou or Zoh would probably avoid confusion with people pronouncing it as "Zuu"</br>  <br>Whitebeard would only tickle him.</br>  <br><br> Basil <br> dying </br></br></br>   yfw Law can kills him in a second by room-ing his heart out <br>I remember when Enel was supposedly invincible until Luffy shows up<br><br>Also in case of this guy being a fruit user, I wonder if the Marines have tried dipping him in water or slapping sea stone on him yet?<br><br>If not, can't they just like have Akainu hugs this guy or something in order to kill him,, you know, instead of using normal weapon like pistols and spears, or hanging</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Name one reason why an island of animals would be called Elephant over Zoo? <br>It might not even be either? One thing is for sure, getting "zoo" out of Zou is a much bigger leap than "fuschia" from Fuusha, which by your own admission was wrong.</br></br>  <br>Perhaps he's Typhon the father of monsters? The snake on his arm could be a clue?</br>  <br>No fruit would be more interesting for someone billed as the strongest living creature.</br>  <br>I'm hoping he has none!</br>  <br>I think it's a possibility but his animal theme is too tempting to not speculate.</br>  <br>He was caught by Marines numerous times it said and he has been carried away on 9 prison ships, only to sink them. I honestly cannot see him having a fruit, both in regards to seastone zapping his power as well as sinking ships and being fine. He could also kill himself effortlessly if he had a fruit.</br>  <br>I dont think Oda cares about that. May even have done it on purpose since he's weird with English sometimes</br>  <br>Fighters without a fruit tend to be boring.</br>  <br>Not ones who can jump 10,000 metres and hit the ground only to brush it off. Do you also find Zoro and Sanji boring? A fruitless Yonkou wouldn't even be farfetched, since Shanks (likely) doesn't.</br>  <br><br>Why does he not just drown himself?</br></br>  <br> One thing is for sure, getting "zoo" out of Zou is a much bigger leap than "fuschia" from Fuusha <br><br>no it isnt. both are only slight alterations of the other word<br><br>And it COULD be something else but of what we know. Zoo sounds correct AND makes more sense that elephant</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe he ate a fruit once in an effort to kill himself. I can see Oda playing that for a gag. His fruit could be something like a Mayfly Zoan.</br>  <br>Yes I find Sanji and Zoro boring. Most strawhats are boring even the ones with fruits.</br>  <br>Go read bleach</br>  <br> no it isnt. both are only slight alterations of the other word <br>Either way, both are wrong.<br> Zoo sounds correct <br>No, it doesn't. I have never heard someone try to say "zoo" in a japanese accent only for it to come out sound like they are trying to "zoh" or "zaw".</br></br></br></br>    <br>sounds correct as in 'Island of Zoans=Zoo'</br>  <br>God I love Brook. Digging the return of the tophat</br>  <br> Law can kills him in a second by room-ing his heart out <br>hello speedreader-kun, you certainly must have missed the part where Law had to get close to Smoker to use the attack to remove his heart.

He seems to be a hybrid of one based on his appearance.</br>  <br> wanting this shitty, unfitting and unfunny meme picture </br>  So how will Luffy and company get to Zou? Especially without Nami. Even with the Vivrecard, the New World weather is crazy.<br><br>I'm betting Viola is gonna join the crew and lead them there.</br></br>  <br>Law will get them there.</br>  I made this OC a couple of threads ago. Could someone please clear up the head area? I only have MSpaint.  <br>There are probably a ton of people on Dressrosa right now that wouldn't mind giving them a ride. I think they're alright for now.</br>  <br>Ok no. Amazon Lily is clearly relevant. Dunno about the others, I can't really remember those arcs too well. But AMAZON Lily. Its a jungle based land with a tribe of FEMALE ONLY warriors. Come on.</br>      <br>Shanks looks like he got hung with an invisible rope</br>      <br>See </br>  <br>it was called little garden because it seemed little for the giants</br>  <br> Robin: Cabin Attendant <br> Franky: Pilot <br>Yet more fuel for the good ship Frobin.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope next arc won't suck just like everything that came post timeskip.</br>    <br>Jaya's name could be referencing an actual island in Indonsia, Papua (It was initially named Irian Jaya before changing to Papua). The Island was in the shape of a bird's head, kinda similar to how Jaya was to a skull. Not to mention the south birds were prevalent creatures in the the Jaya/Sypiea arc.</br>      My theory: Kaido ate hundreds of zoan devil fruits to kill himself but failed.<br><br>Now he can use a lot of them and of course awaken some though not lose control unlike impel down's guards.</br></br>  <br>You obviously have shit taste then because every arc has been good and post timeskip has been fantastic<br><br>The only improvements I would like are using multiple figures in the same panel to show new moves off properly, even if there are lots of events to show. As in if Zoro was performing a move, it would show the start, the swipe, and the finish in the same panel so they can illustrate them as well as in previous, simpler arcs</br></br></br>  <br>dont reply to bait</br>  <br>I wonder how Kaidou was on a sky island.</br>  <br>c'mon anon.</br>  So with a quirk like this, there is only two things I could see Oda do with him. Kaido will either:<br><br>-be beaten so close to his death that he actually starts to fear the possibility of dying<br>-or he'll just be killed</br></br></br>  <br>this is the best one.</br>  <br> not shutting down even baitposters <br>Get good</br></br>   hawkins does a tarot reading <br> kidd asks what their survival rating is <br> hawkins just says nothing and starts trembling </br></br>  <br>He jumped</br>  <br>he would die if he fell into water.<br>so according to your theory he's not serious with killing himself</br></br>  <br>-or almost gets beaten to death by Luffy, but still retains his quirk, so he follows Luffy around protecting him thinking one day this kid will become strong enough to kill me.</br>  <br>Moria might have had the right idea there, fight fire with fire and so on.</br>  <br>Of course you cannot eat more than 1 fruit if you aren't immortal or extremely lucky maybe</br>  What if he is so ridiculously strong that he can't drown?  <br>Cabin attendant? What?</br>  <br>that's assuming he has a devil fruit. and assuming his species or whatever he is can't just breathe underwater</br>  <br> Niggastream version. </br>  I'm still in disbelief at this guy's introduction i was expecting him to be shown the way Whitebeard and Big Mom were.  <br>Marinefordbaby: The post</br>  <br>lame? Of all the many captains on the sea. He is THE captain.</br>  <br>The crew is a bunch of /pol/ nuts, but their JR is pretty cool.</br>  <br>Does Kaido have two peglegs or is it just me?</br>  <br>What's that supposed to mean? Whitebeard was introduced attached to some medical equipment and drinking sake by the barrel, Big Mom was introduced eating her own mooks.</br>  <br>We still haven't formally introduced with Big Mom.</br>  <br>I mean him just just chilling with his crew getting news of Doffy's failure and getting pissed.</br>  <br>So Kaidou is GyuuMaou. Yeah, a magical Monkey will defeat him for sure.</br>   the strongest supernova doesn't even fear Kaidou <br>When will Urouge oneshot anyone important?</br>  <br>When Sentoumaru tries to arrest him.</br>  <br> Kaido tries to make Luffy marry his daughter </br>  <br>Time to share it.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Anc<wbr>wu_9KFTk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Nami isn't the only capable navigator in the World, you know. If fucking Lola could travel backwards from the New World, I'm sure someone can help Luffy out.</br>  <br>flight attendent</br>  <br> 9 hours ago <br> not 2 years ago </br></br>  <br>It's still weird.</br>  <br>That one reminds me a bit of Roshio's<br> RIP </br></br>  <br>It could be an old picture</br>  <br>Now I remember how excited I was when we first got to Mock Town and actual pirate shit happened.</br>  <br> le everything sucks post timeskip maymay </br>  <br>Yeah, it was a pretty nice thing to come into. Also Blackbeard</br>  <br>i want mad hyena bellamy but on luffys side<br><br>not this pussy shit where all he does is suck doffys feathery pink dick</br></br></br>  So, after Fujitora presented everything to the whole world, the wg is bound to give them new bounties right? <br><br>Can we look forward to bounties for God Usopp and his crew then?</br></br>  <br>Man, Pizarro looks like Oars/Oars Jr./Kaido</br>  <br>Yes and yes. This is another obvious parallel to Alabasta. After the Straw hats get a new bounty we probably see quite a few people being fed up/surprised about it.</br>  <br>This has been pointed out before. But does it mean anything?</br>  I think Kaido will be an ally. Almost every single major villain Luffy has fought has been rather 'quirk'less. Kuro, Krieg, Arlong, Crocodile, Bellamy, Enel, Lucci, Moria, Hody and Doffy. The people with quirks end up being allies, like Buggy.<br><br>So Kaido is probably going to be a sort of rival for Luffy. His tattoo and and design could reflect Gear 4. He probably would lose to the alliance to advance the plot but he'd stick around as an ally.<br><br>This is completely baseless speculation, of course.</br></br></br></br>  <br> This is completely baseless speculation, of course. <br>Stopped reading there.</br></br>  <br>I won't <br>it was a good arc but it had a few flaws, one being too long</br></br>  <br> Kuro <br> Crocodile <br> Bellamy <br> Moria <br> Doffy <br><br>In what world are these characters quirkless? How did you finish typing Doffy's name without realizing how dumb you were being?<br><br>not understanding characters is one thing.. but DOFFY? come the fuck on</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't see it. If Kaido actually wants to die, he isn't going to team up with someone that can't kill him, or can't offer a solution to the not dying problem<br><br>Also I was thinking, if Whitebeard presumably can't kill him, Kaido's war is also kind of pointless because surely there isn't going to be anyone in the world that can actually kill him anyway since Whitebeard was fighting exceptionally powerful opponents while sick and dying.<br><br>The only way I'm thinking this might end is if Blackbeard decides to appear and actually kills Kaido after a bunch of people have been fighting him, setting BB up nicely to be an extreme arse-raper and worthy of final boss status</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you are read the whole post</br>  <br>how was Doflamingo complex exactly?<br>fallen noble who wants to fuck the world up because muh childhood trauma<br><br><br>they must be thinking he's not actually caught by the marines and it's all part of his plan</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's doing that thing called "joking" ever heard of it?</br>  I believe Kaido will just ignore Kidd and his gang deeming them as useless piece of shits who won't even be able to touch him.  <br>I just hope so. It's what I'm looking forward the most for the last half year.<br><br>Too bad Sanji won't get a decent bounty again. Probably to make him do more spy work later.</br></br></br>  <br> as seen when he was talking in a friendly manner with Urogue. <br>we didn't see them talking<br>for what we know Kaidou may have been completely ignoring them</br></br></br>  <br> stopped reading at the end of the post <br><br>Man you're some motherfucking though guy.</br></br></br>  <br>great more fanart for everyone...</br>  <br>Kuro's quirk is him fixing his glasses ?<br>Crocodile's is what ? Bellamy, what ? Moria is lazy, sure but not really a quirk. Doffy's quirk is his nickname ? <br><br>What I mean by 'quirk' is stuff like Buggy being pissed about his nose or Magellan's diahrea or Hannybal's Warden ambition. Funny stuff like that. <br><br><br>You really think Kaido will die ? Come on bro, even Doffy lived through it. And I don't really mean Kaido will be on Luffy's side, he just won't be against him, if that makes sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Kaido has actually eaten 100 zoans <br> constantly switches animals mid-combo <br> like grabbing someone as a snake, flying upwards as an eagle, then falling down on them as a whale <br>  Luffy gear 5s him down to a draw eventually with a lot of help after a ten chapter fight <br> Kaido seems down for the count <br> suddenly grabs into a barrel next to him <br> pulls out a fistful of rumble balls <br> eats them all at once <br> no chapter next week <br>Post yfw.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have no prove for this, but to me it seemed like he didn't noticed them. That's quite a big difference to ignoring someone. Maybe he is actually bling as people suggested or he has no CoO. I would also guess that he can't hear. but that is impossible as his subordinates called for him.</br>  <br>Sanji was already working in a kitchen before meeting Zeff you dingus</br>  <br>Don't read weekly if you can't handle it.</br>  <br> next chapter he explodes and dies <br>GODA<br>O<br>D<br>A</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kidd will likely lose another arm. <br>he doesn't need them anyway</br></br>  <br> fallen noble who wants to fuck the world up because muh childhood trauma <br>typical summary by a childish, superficial thinking mind</br></br>  <br>doesnt mean he would have stayed there<br><br>without Zeff saving his life, maybe Sanji would realize his true calling instead of achieving someone else's dream out of some misguided sense of obligation</br></br></br>  <br> Any damage is inflicted on the person the Doll corresponds to <br>where do you get that? all we know is that Hawkin can transfer his own damage to one of his dolls<br>nothing more<br><br/></br></br></br></br>  Is it me or is Luffy really handsome?    <br> Name one reason why an island of animals would be called Elephant over Zoo? <br><br>because we don't know anything about this island? why would an island be called after kaidou's men? the name of an island is probably older than that</br></br></br>  <br>Kaido won't die if it's Luffy fighting him, but Luffy fighting him and being victorious would be a total asspull even at this point. The Doffy win was only satisfying because Law severely weakened him so Luffy wouldn't get decked</br>  Post YFW Doflamingo comes in to save the day with his Heaven String:16 Heavenly Arrows and defeats Kaido  I think Oda should have made Kaido's head bigger, it's starting to irk me.  <br>Are you talking about urouge?</br>  <br>Just you bud.</br>  <br>I agree and that's why I'm leaning towards the "not an enemy" route. Then again, I can see Luffy beating him if the Kid alliances joins him. 7 supernova's is nothing to laugh at. Still, Kaido won't die, of course. Just beaten.</br>  <br>it could have been cool if the enemies weren't so much forgettable<br>FI worst arc</br></br>  <br>Fuck off, fag! We've had such a nice time since the Kaidou reveal.</br>  <br>He's like Zodd. All the nutrients go to the horns.</br>  <br>I don't know what the problem with FI is, it was clear from the start the the villains won't be much of a challenge and it made complete sense. Instead Oda focused on making it a theme heave arc and in my humble opinion he succeeded with it.</br>  <br>Judging by the things in impel down, I imagine monster chopper is basically Toni's awakened zoan form, so a rumble ball is basically an awakening kickstarter for zoans.<br><br>Three questions remain:<br>if Kaido ate 100 zoans, did he awaken them? If yes, all of them at once? Only a few? As in his selected few "main" fruits?<br><br>Is there another Zoan user with multiple "points"? We only ever saw human, animal or half-half.<br><br>When was the last t time someone called Chopper Toni?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mistaken journey to west with dbz</br>  <br><br>This guy is going to cause the death of thousands of people, it's not something Luffy will forgive and become bros after exchanging some blows like with Z, the island under his control must be hell too.</br></br>  <br><br> implying the trio won't explain they want to take down Big Mom <br> implying he won't have them join his side in the upcoming war <br> 2011 + 14 <br><br>ISHYGDDT<br>S<br>H<br>Y<br>G<br>D<br>D<br>T</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> luffy has a talking reindeer <br> law has a talking polar bear <br> hawkins has a talking cat <br>What does it mean?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kuro is super intelligent man wasting his talent doing convoluted, goofy shit<br><br>Crocodile is smug overly aggressive wildcard<br><br>Bellamy, when he isn't being beaten and crying, is Bartolomeo's schtick. Pissing people off, being more confident than he can back up<br><br>Moria is fucking Moria<br><br>Doffy. A man in old-lady glasses, capris, flats and a fucking feather boa as a coat. Fucks with marines in their own base only to stand down because his favorite old woman told him to. Killed his immediate family then spends the rest of his life taking in strays. Cant make up his mind between killing Law and saving Law even after shooting the bastard multiple times.<br><br>No one IN this series is more quirky than Doffy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mistaking DBZ for Saiyuki </br>  I fell out of reading One Piece around about the Gladiator arena storyline, about 12/18 months ago because it got kinda played out. I know that Sabo came back, but I didnt get that far.<br><br>Has OP been worth reading in that time I was away from it? I see a lot of threads about it, but I'm not sure if it's worth getting back into or not. To clarify, I was a huge OP fan, but it got kinda slow after Marineford, at least for me</br></br>  <br> Has OP been worth reading in that time I was away from it?

Kaido is just gonna be that guy who keeps coming back again and again, I think. <br><br><br>None of those are things that I would consider to be "quirks", unfortunately. I get what you're trying to say but most of it is just their straight personality. Like, no one bats an eye about Moria's existence or Doffy's fashion sense. It's all fairly normal for people to have wild and crazy designs.</br></br></br></br>  <br> cringe: the post <br>This is like those lame ass comments people leave on porn videos.</br></br>  <br>He was not "evil just because".

I loved Skypiea but just to compare it, it had less content per the length of it. How did you feel reading Skypiea weekly since you claim to have read since Jaya?<br><br>Don't bother bringing up underagers, because most of them have the same outlook as you do.</br></br></br>  <br>at least Shirahoshi did something and even rescued everyones asses at the end of the arc and she at least will play a huge role later in the story due to being an ancient weapong that will also get trained by someone on top of it. I am already looking forwad to seeing here again and who exactly trained her. She is a character with still a lot of potential, Rebecca has nothing of that sort to offer.</br>  <br> that shit shit mushi <br>hah! neger!</br></br>  <br> Shirley's the only redeemable part of this arc <br><br>Den-chan was a cutie</br></br></br>  <br>2nd den den mushi from the left<br> Hey, who let that nigger in here?" </br></br>  <br>Relevant</br>  <br>ah I mean from the right</br>  <br>how lewd</br>  <br> Coating Franky's brother </br>  <br> Kaido has Kaiju devil fruit <br> We find out more about awakened zoans <br> King Kong vs Godzilla end-of-arc fight <br><br> yfw </br></br></br></br></br>   army of zoans arc <br> zou <br> zoo <br> mindblown </br></br></br>  <br> glasses fuck up Iceburg's beard at the end of the gif <br><br>I was going to post something witty but this gif is triggering me hard</br></br></br>  <br> Dressrosa officially over <br><br><br>So after Dressrosa is over, can we agree, that story was rewritten during the arc?<br> Trebol was shown as a good sniper, so an (second) Usopp vs Trebol fight was erased <br> Leo, Nui Nui user was introduced and his power remained nearly unused.

I think he was supposed to be the opponent of the Ito Ito somehow. <br>He stitched Law's arm together, used his power to restrain Robin when they captured her, defeated Jora and sewed up all the executives and probably a few more things. He got enough use.<br> Executives' fights were speed up and mostly shit <br>They were fine; I enjoyed them all. You can't have long fights when there's so many to get through, otherwise the arc would take another 6 months.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>obin is the worst strawhat ?<br> slut <br> irrevelant <br> never speaking <br> suck at fighting <br> awful outfit </br></br></br></br></br></br>  If kaido doesn't have the invulnerability fruit, or some kind of mythical zoan that grants immortality, oda has to explain why he can passively and unwillingly destroy any killing method used to execute him (guillotine etc).  <br>Ceasar said they escaped from big mom and then got in new trouble right away. Oda did not show us how they met this girl they were talking about and how they ran into Kaidous men.</br>  <br> mfw when dragon is not luffys dad but his mom  <br>  you heard it here first </br></br>  <br>He's so powerful that things just break.</br>  <br>Oh hai Robin-hate fag.

All of them made sense to me except for Brook, which Oda said would be a detective <br>Nigger Oda didn't declare their jobs. Another fan had already sent him a postcard saying what their jobs might be and Oda said "sure why not."<br><br> O: Ok. So about this, I actually ended up finding the answer on a postcard from another fan. <br><br>That's how all character birthdays are decided.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Strawhat banter is best banter  <br>so... he declared them?<br>are you high?</br></br>  <br>I think Jaya/Skypiea's the best arc of One Piece since it's the embodiment of what the manga is supposed to be about<br>fun adventures and romance<br><br><br>I agree<br><br><br> That's how racism works. There is no constant reasons behind it. <br>lel<br>people actually believe that<br><br><br>understanding that he'll be fodder since the beginning doesnt make him any less bad<br>since we had to put up with this shit for a long time<br>also<br> animefag <br><br><br>I won't be baited that easily /a/non-chan<br><br><br>his body is that strong<br><br><br>nor whose the people they're trying to save</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was really hoping he would be the one to suicide</br>  <br>Godd thing Nami changed her mind about not wearing a miniskirt</br>  <br>it means you're not supposed to get invested in shit tier fights, you're supposed to get invested in what made him so fucked<br>"nothing at all" was a top tier scene</br></br>  <br>I love how everyone excepts no less from each other.

I think.</br></br>  <br>the problem is that oda is not actually immortal and actively limits himself</br>  <br>Maybe he is. Think about it, Kaido is an anagram for Oda Ki. Kaido has the ki of oda, which makes him immortal. Oda can draw this out as long as he wants.</br>  <br>Who will replace Oda when he dies, anyway? I doubt he'll last until the end when he's so absolutely nonchalant about his health.</br>  <br> oda will die when the manga ends <br> we will never get those supernova grand line first half spinoffs <br>why live</br></br></br>  <br>Obviously Kubo<br> the ride never ends </br></br>  <br>He'll pull a GRRM and not let anybody finish it.</br>  <br><br><br>Same tbh</br></br></br>  <br>His assistants of course.

Welp, Sanjis time to shine!</br>  <br> we will never get those supernova grand line first half spinoffs <br>WUT</br></br>  Is Kaidou a descendant of Oars ?<br>Can we assume he's DF-less since if he was he could simply kill himself by jumping into the water ? Why doesn't he eat one for that reason ?<br><br>Will Luffy's gear 5 involve giving the properties of his fruit to a seastone staff ?

I wouldn't be surprised if he's semi-related to Oars Jr</br>  <br>debatable</br>  <br> Out of all pirate crews his is the least creative </br>  <br>I don't know. G4 King Kong punch seems like something that'd tickle Kaido. What he just brushed off without even a scratch was more deadly than King Kong punch.</br>  <br> Kid is born in the same year as me <br>Mah nigga</br></br>  <br>she's a good girl</br>  <br>probably all really close to each other, in the end Blackbeard will be the strongest</br>    <br>I'd say Shanks is currently the "official" strongest among Emperors, although the general population might think Kaidou is, but Blackbeard already surpassed him and will soon prove it.<br>I know I'll cry like a little bitch.</br></br>  <br>aren't we comparing hype levels?</br>  Kaidou's reveal did not disappoint. Now hopefully Big Mom won't either when we'll get our first clear view of her  Why is Urouge considered so strong? His power doesn't seem that great, and he got beat up like the other Supernovas just as easily.  <br>he's not. Do you really believe people claiming Urouge will become a Yonkou and such are actually serious?</br>  <br> he got beat up like the other Supernovas just as easily <br><br>implying current big ones weren't defeated sometime during they journey when they were young beginners</br></br></br>  <br>I guess; Kaido's been awaited for like a decade now though. A lot of the negative faggots ruined things when G4 came out because they didn't get their "ebin cool protag" design, while the rest of us enjoyed it. I personally read both chapters without reading spoilers first (great decision) and the Kaido one got my blood pumping more than G4 did.</br>  <br><br>Are you gus retarded? Urouge is obviously the strongest of the supernova. Oda gave him the lowest bounty to show how he differs from Kidd the guy who had the highest. Kidd was a mass murderer will Urouge helped the people and fought his own fights. It's like Urouge is almost a nicer guy than luffy.</br></br>  <br>I know anon, but they just won't understand. Better keep it simple. One day they'll know.</br>  <br>Because he talked like old pals to the strongest and most fearsome living being and tried to talk him out of killing himself. He had no fear of him whatsoever.</br>  <br>I wonder how his face fits to his former silhouette.<br>Only Big Mom was the one whose design was changed and got rounder. But it's happened maybe during TS.</br></br>  <br>Getting beat up is what makes Urogue stronger. It's literally his DF.</br>  <br> my semi-OC's get reposted <br>wow</br></br>  <br>He didn't know it's Kaido.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Oh fuck. I don't know what to believe any longer. This is some super saiyan shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How upset do you think the general's gonna be when it turns out Monet is alive?</br>  <br>I think Kaidou's appereance alone is threatening enough or do you suggest that the Kidd alliance knows Kaidou and only Urouge doesn't? Which would be quite retarded.</br>  <br>nope, because he doesn't remain strong. He only releases the power he tanked before. And I bet it has a time limit too.</br>  <br>Maybe he did, maybe he just doesn't fear him.</br>  <br>She is literally the most relevant Straw Hat aside from Luffy due to her ability to translate poneglyphs. <br><br>Also Franky is more relevant than everyone but Luffy and Robin due to his knowledge of Pluton. <br><br>Literally every other Straw Hat is expendable. <br><br>Deal w/ it Zorofag</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How upset do you think the general's gonna be when it turns out Monet joins the Strawhats?</br>  <br>Well that sucks. I'm sure he could learn to harvest it though, no? Reminds me a bit of that X-men villain, who is incredibly powerful.</br>  <br> He only releases the power he tanked before. And I bet it has a time limit too. <br>Doesn't changes the fact that the fights are still making his original body better. He will naturally become stronger and tank more. It's the logical conclusion.</br></br>  <br>Why would be retarded? Luffy barely knows something about the big names. <br><br>inb4 timeskip</br></br></br>  <br><br>According to Oni mythology monks don't fear Onis, and it's likely Kaido has the oni oni no mi</br></br>  <br>because luffy is an ignorant brat maybe?</br>  <br>What if Urouge is ignorant too?</br>  <br>So you're suggesting that Urouge did not know kaidou and didn't fear him because of that, but the Kidd alliance knows who Kaidou is and only fears him because of that name? I don't think so m8.<br><br><br> likely Kaido has the oni oni no mi <br>No it's not Kaidou only looks like oars or do you think every oars has a oni related fruit? That's literally wrong.</br></br></br></br></br>   Kidd actually beats Kaido <br> this thread when </br>  <br>Does this angel look ignorant?</br>  <br> No it's not Kaidou only looks like oars or do you think every oars has a oni related fruit? That's literally wrong. <br>What if those types of giants are Oda's species/interpretations of Onis. It does't have to be fruit related, especially since it seems like Kaido might not have a fruit.</br></br>  Guys, shut the fuck up, Kaidou had no reason to fuck Urouge up, they just met on a sky island while Kaidou was gonna try to suicide.  <br> onis are immortal <br> are made up of multiple beasts <br> he even has the oni clothes, anklets, chains and horns <br> monkey statues (aka Luffy) guard against Oni </br></br></br></br>  He can't have the oni fruit and the luck fruit at the same time unless Oda went full hack and decided double DF is just a thing now.  <br>Not really. There's more than enough evidence that could point to her not being dead, like the icepick not being in her heart anymore despite Ceasar stabbing right through the ground, and it's still standing upright (meaning he'd have to have dislodge the pick, take off the heart, then stab the pick in the ground again because reasons, and pass out).<br><br>THIS is what would piss off /a/.</br></br></br>  <br>well that's possible why not<br><br><br>And literally nothing suggests that he has a oni FRUIT.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't have the Luck Luck fruit you tard</br>  <br> Kaido ate the oni fruit so exploding doesn't do anything since he's so durable <br> Luffy eats a second fruit and doesn't die because he's made of rubber </br></br>  <br> &gt;he even has the oni clothes, anklets, chains and horns <br><br>what? he's dressed like a Sumo, m8</br></br></br>  <br> he didn't read the real translation </br>  <br>Since Kaidou is silhouetted and at a semi-far distance away from Urouge in the panel I assumed that he thought it was just some guy. His crew doesn't identify him as Kaidou either. The Alliance saw him up close and could identify him<br><br>Also do people think it's pronounced Sheeps-head or Sheep-shead?</br></br></br>  <br>Nevermind forgot that Urouge fought him, my bad</br>  <br> Since Kaidou is silhouetted and at a semi-far distance away from Urouge in the panel I assumed that he thought it was just some guy. <br>I think kaidou appearence is unique enough that you would probably guess who or rather what the fuck the guy in front of you is. Even if the guy was a bit away, Urouge talked to him, so he clearly wasn't too far from the high priest.</br></br>  <br>100% made for sex</br>  Kaido has the cockroach fruit.<br>He can survive anything. Even nuclear explosions.</br>  Will Oda ever stop samefacing/samebodying women?  <br>Does not explain the luck aspect</br>  <br>Will you ever stop being a faggot?</br>  <br>Will you ever stop sucking dick?</br>  <br>nope, you get a Wasp or a Blob</br>  <br>I don't know man he might- candy</br>  So Sanji beat Big Mom's crew? So he's Marco/Jozu level?  <br><br>Or they ran away.</br></br>  <br>Siapa?</br>  I just now realized that this was Kaidou's shadow being projected from the sky island. A throwback to what happened in the beginning of the Skypea Arc.  <br>That's not how shadows fucking work. Goddamn it Oda.</br>  <br><br>It's sad to what extent you will go to do damage control. Just admit that you were wrong, and move on.</br></br>  Anyone else notice how Kaidou has the same horns as Oars Jr.?<br><br>Maybe he's part whatever breed of Giants Oars is, or maybe they're just horns because horns are cool. Or it could be part of his DF.</br></br>  Where do people get the idea that he has a luck power? Sounds more like he is just incredibly tough. Was it just a bad initial translation?  <br> Anyone else notice how Kaidou has the same horns as Oars Jr.? <br>No you're literally the first one detective</br></br>  <br>What is he doing damage control for?</br>  <br><br>Having the dumb idea that that's his silhouette/shadow, and not a building.</br></br>  Shut up Kaidou, we just started the second part of grand line. We don't need another war already.  <br>I was only asking, sperg-king. I hadn't seen anyone else bring it up. <br><br>What do you reckon though?</br></br></br>  Can't Kaidou just let Akainu fist his asshole for a whole day? That should help both of them.  <br>fuck off back to reddit or whatever board you came from you shit stain</br>  <br><br> Akainu tries this <br> rips his arm off </br></br></br>  <br>Never even been to reddit fam. This shit stain is home grown 4chan! Why do you hate yourself so much?</br>  <br> This shit stain is home grown 4chan! <br>Fucking mememaster, if you look down on 5chinks then why are you even here?</br></br>  <br>How fucking fast are you faggots drawing?</br>  <br> looking down on <br>How was I? Project much?<br><br>Why are you so salty? I just wanted to talk about Kaidou's horns for fuck sake.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How about you just stop reading something you don't renjoy? Oh right, your life is that shit and you actually enjoy it but are too depressive to acknowledge it.</br>  <br>They have suspiciously similar Jolly Rogers too (Assuming the guys going after the Curly Hats are Kaido's men)</br>  <br> How was I? Project much? <br>commit kaidou</br></br>  <br>Do you think he didn't in one of the several times he got captured? Whatever is the way they'll kill him it will be very stupid regardless since Oda set the bar way too high.</br>  <br>Shit dude, I hadn't looked at the Jolly Rogers. They do look pretty similar. I hope we get more about the different kinds of giants from Kaidou, we need to good giant arc.

They control weather.</br>   without that shitty war there would have been a Whitebeard vs. Kaido fight <br><br>What team would you be if you could choose? Remember that Shanks was able to stop/prevent him from attacking Whitebeard.</br></br>  <br>Maybe we're not so different after all.<br>Peas in a pod, you and I.</br></br>  <br> impplying shank didn't off him with words <br><br> oh hey red hair, I'm gonna fuck that old man up <br> no fuck off <br> I-I see </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What team would you be <br>WB, always WB. <br><br>...Until he got backstabbed by that piece of shit and was just coughing the whole time from that moment on.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe it'll turn out that Shanks and Kaidou are bro as fuck and Shanks just asked Kaidou not to. I'd kind of like that.</br>  <br>Kaido seems to be immortal but I just like old man Whitebeard too much. Maybe he could knock Kaido out.<br><br>Seems like he did it before anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is the shit snail black?<br>Racism?</br></br>  <br>Kaido was probably going to Marineford because he knew it'd be his last chance to get Whitebeard to kill him before his own inevitable death.</br>  <br><br>I reckon Kaidou's scars are from WB, Roger and probably Garp.</br></br>   Yfw Kaidou is the child of WB and   Shakky   <br><br>Has it ever been explained how snail phones work? Do the two snails pair up, and then psychically communicate with each other?</br></br>  <br>WB would be "I AM SHIROHIGE ffs" all over Kaidou's ass.</br>  Now that the dust has settled and two days have passed. What is the general consensus what Kaido's powers are/why he can't die? Luck? Actually immortal? Devil Fruit yes/no? Do we still beleive he's a Zoan?  <br><br>WB has more followers, and can probably disable KD for a while with his powerset. He could win by fucking up his crew, and then ganging up on him with his whole fleet. If it was 1v1, old WB would probably lose.</br></br>  <br><br>I really hope we get to see some Prime WB in action, maybe a fight vs. Roger or whatever.<br><br>Sitting on a boat isn't enough.</br></br></br></br>  Wait a motherfucking second.<br><br>Jozu lost an arm? Shit. Now I guess we won't ever see him fighting seriously again.</br></br>  <br>And it will always be the original flag. No idea why Oda even changed the Japanese version.</br>  <br>he is obviously one of the few people who got the immortality from teh Ope Ope no Mi.</br>  <br> we need to good giant arc. Been waiting for that shit since Little Garden. <br>Elbaf will appeal to you then.</br></br>  <br>Some mythical zoan.<br><br><br>There is no way it could live up to your imagination. Leave it be. Having it clouded by history will be the best thing, with old Whitebeard giving you a glimpse of it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Now that the dust has settled <br><br>Nigga, he was literally revealed two days ago, NOTHING is settled, and there is ZERO info regarding his abilities.<br><br>He is not actually immortal (fuck Oda for introducing the shitty immortality operation idea and ushering a whole new era of retarded fan-theories), just hellishly tough as a result of leading a hard life.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Hell yeah, I'd like more about the other groups of giants Saul talked about though, also what the fuck the deal is with Oars's race. <br><br>I love this crap, the worldbuilding is probably what got me hooked on One Piece in the first place.</br></br></br>  <br> all those people shitting on the arc in the anime <br>Apart from the shitty Buggy/Hanckock filters I thought it was amazing. Almost every key scene looked brilliant and was amazingly well animated. How Whitebeard fucks up that giant, how he gets stabbed and magma punched, Luffy vs. Marines, Oz Jr, how WB knocks out Aka Inu, freeing Ace which was movie quality.</br></br>  <br> Shanks: Hey Kaido, I heard there's a good place to go kill yourself over there" <br> Kaido: Oh cool! I'll go check it out. Thanks Shanks. <br>FTFY</br></br></br>  <br>Because he decided he didn't want to portray whitebeard as a nazi.</br>  <br>Hope you're trolling.</br>  <br> dumb people like this are the reason it was changed <br> Hitler invented gammadion cross </br></br>  <br>He realized that dealing with all the negative, albeit inaccurate, criticism from using that mark just isn't worth it.</br>  <br>this<br><br><br>and i think he's been eating a lot of Zoans and smileys, remember that zoans amplify the power of the user.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Friendly reminder that Kidd fought alongside Luffy and Law before Law became a major character and that Hawkins' and Apoo's fight against Kizaru was hilarious.</br>  <br>Why does he never look that awesome in any of the games and instead like a Playdo blob?</br>  <br> playing games <br>/v/ pls</br></br>  <br><br><br> hey I hope my manga can be successful in markets all over the world so I can make lots of money! <br><br> Whats that you say? the vast majority of white people associate swastikas with nazis? <br><br> maybe I will change that flag <br><br>It does not matter if a regime did not invent a symbol to the majority of the population.<br><br>The soviet union did not invent the hammer or sickle but if I put them on a flag people are not going to think of farming equipment and carpentry.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 2015  <br> not playing video games <br>Doesn't exist.</br></br></br>  <br>Some of the hundredth chapters don't have huge reveals/moments<br><br>100 - introduction of dragon<br>200 - luffy punches crocodile<br>300 - fairy vearth is revealed to be the moon, shandian/skpyiean war is declared over<br>400 - beginning of 'you have to beat cp9 members and get keys'<br>500 - introduction of rayleigh<br>600 - strawhats fucking around at saboady<br>700 - doflamingo has the mera mera no mi</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They could always edit the NA/EU versions, no need to change the Japanese version. And I think even in the EU Naruto and Bleach mangas you have swastikas.</br>  <br> taking the bait headon <br>You've got guts</br></br>  <br>I used to think the continent-puller giants were just a different tribe on Elbaf, but I have since read somewhere they came from another island/country. There are also giants from islands other than Elbaf according to Saul who are not the viking/warrior sorts. Most likely the civil looking ones in the giant squad are from there (ie the female and the male VA in the suit).</br>  <br><br>Well don't know about Naruto, but Kubo does not give a flying fuck about anyone.</br></br>  Why didn't Whitebeard just use Gura Gura no Gatling?  Guys, what if they want Momonosuke so bad is because he ate the SMILE that works the most properly &amp; all the other ADFs give you disproportionate Zoan abilities? Like, Kaido ate the Zo Zo no mi but the tusks grow from his head instead of his mouth, like that Sheepbone has horns from his hands.<br><br>Might explain why they're after that girl too, if she's not a mink man. She's a human that ate the Deer fruit isn't she?....CHOPPER'S ARC</br></br>  <br> implying she isn't a deer who ate the mink fruit <br>Get to my level anon</br></br>  <br>I thought that too, can't wait to get some more on it.<br>I'd like some more about the Giant Squad too to be honest.</br></br>  <br>Le Grass Cap Buccaneers</br>  <br>I'd like some more of the *cough* giant squad too.</br>  <br>OM NOM NOM IMMA EAT YOU SENPAI</br>  <br><br> death by snu snu </br></br>  <br>Law's crew already made the sacrifice.</br>  <br>Dofla pulls a Robin and joins the Crew.</br>  What does mundane mean?

You're obviously asking this question to the wrong people. While shounenshit has around 15% of the board and the rest is random garbage, moeshitter focus to make the shounen portion even smaller here. What can you get from that? Right that actually quality manga like vagabond won't even have the chance to be genuinly appreciated here as the audience here is retarded either way.</br>  I would honestly love if there was a full on decent anime with that art style,  <br>If that's the case, why do people support artists being lazy?</br>   Reality is tough, so read this manga about cute girls and feel better   <br>Because I like said content.</br>  Because anime isn't the medium for actual artists.  <br>That would be a massive undertaking. Each frame would have to be painstakingly created from scratch and you couldn't use animation tricks like pic related like you can with more cartoony artstyles.</br>  <br> comparing anime art to manga art </br>  <br> Why don't my anime look like they were drawn by Inoue? <br>Because if you tried to animate something in that style, half the staff would kill themselves before completing it.</br></br>  <br>Are you insinuating that moeshit doesn't have a firm grip on the manga market, too?</br>  Would you lick the sweat from Lenfrieds underboob?    <br>Any idea how she acquired her piss fetish?</br>  Already seen her vajayjay, there's no mystery left to her.<br><br>Ushijima on the other hand is tastefully cock-teasing.</br></br>    <br>Her fetish? More like ours. <br><br><br>We have seen her pussy spread open emitting piss, but we have yet to get a full view of her tits.</br></br></br></br>  Piss is my fetish but I don't know it seems to be pretty fake.
