[   <br>Nuit is soon. I can feel it.</br>  <br> implying <br>Not for at least 5 volumes, I'd warrant.</br></br>  <br>This volume literally blew away any possiblity of that happening.</br>  <br>You serious? She finally realized she isn't good enough. Now she'll probably try to get better and  accomplish absolutely nothing until Crowley finally says "her time has come for my keikaku" and pushes the button for her to power up .</br>  <br>Realizing weakness is the first step to an upgrade anon.<br><br>Do you even Dragonball?</br></br></br>  <br> wanting DB tier writing in Raildex </br>  <br>Frankly, the ridiculously broken power levels of Touma's adversaries (especially the Magic Gods) bring this closer than you think.<br><br>And I'd rather DB than Infinite Stratos, if you know what I mean.</br></br></br>  Now that the series seems to be flipped on its head yet again, how do. You guys see this series?<br><br>Hard mode: no Touma shipping<br>Super hard mode: no shipping at all</br></br></br>  Reminder that Touma calls Mikoto useless and a burden.<br><br>Mikotofags literally BTFO.</br></br>  Just ran through NT12 and what there is of 13 because backlog.<br> Magic Gods are just Keikaku Doori to Aleister. <br>Doghara was the one who fucked up Zombie, right? Dog is scary.<br> Laura trying to Keikaku <br>For someone who's clearly in the same loop as Aleister, she's actually done very little. So I can't imagine her actually doing anything.<br> Hamazura the only one realizing how broken Touma's mind is <br>I also like how Hamazura also has a very useful AI waifu. She's been a hell of a lot more useful than his other ones, anyway.<br><br> Mikoto wants to learn about what broke Touma and made him side with Othinus. Then immediately loses to her anger and attacks him. <br>Mikoto needs therapy at this point. Granted being hospitalized a few times isn't going affect Touma's broken mentality at this point.<br><br> And what's this about the Chocolate Goddess joining the dorm freeloading squad? It's not like 4 other girls haven't done the same thing and gotten thrown out. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Battery Misaka is the cutest.</br>  <br> Super hard mode: no shipping at all <br>Shiage has Rikou. You don't see wars over whether he should've picked Mugino or Saiai or Fremea.</br></br>  <br> Anti-Touma kills the magic gods, but Nephthys comes out alive and asks Touma for help and he takes her to his room. <br><br>This better generate a lot of fanart.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't he practically going out with all of them? Saiai takes him to shitty movies and Mugino actually listens to him unlike with literally anyone else.<br><br>Fremea imouto status.</br></br></br>  <br> the loli gets killed <br><br>As expected from a faggot loli hater author</br></br></br>  <br>Sounds like a temporary deal then, like with Fraulein. Oh well, guess Touma can't get the chocolate onee-san he probably wants.<br> Maybe she'll finally be the woman to become his dorm manager. </br></br>  God how is touma not depressed or suicidal. HIs life just sucks ass  <br>Because Will-tan told him to shut up and live.<br><br>Praise be to Will-tan.</br></br></br>  <br>Careful, you're trying a bit too hard there.</br>  <br>Season 3 when faggots?</br>  <br>LRD pls. Don't start that retard in here.</br>  <br> So, what exactly did Aleister do to them? I get he changed their parameters so that could be killed, but what exactly does that mean? Did they just get a general debuff so they're weaker, rendered completely powerless, or what? </br>  <br> temporary <br> It will depend on the next volume. Apparently Anti-Touma is after Othinus, and he hasn't realized Nephtys is still alive. He can kill magic gods without even trying. Shit is about to get real. </br></br>  When will New Testament get good guys?  <br>I wish.</br>  <br>I just can't picture anyone else staying there, since people like Fraulein get brought back there every now and then and go on their way. Didn't Aisa (who?) get shoved into Komoe's place after having nowhere to go as well?<br> And especially after the new threat is defeated, she'd have no reason staying in the dorm. Index is there because Laura and Crowley Keikaku-ing, and Othinus is there because she's powerless and literally everyone else hates her. </br></br>  <br>Never</br>  <br>It would be funny if she stays with Touma though. He would probably be flustered and trying to contain his boner with a big breasted oneesan girl living with him.</br>  Purple is my way of life.  <br>I think it'd be great too, it's just that's also exactly why I don't think it would happen.<br><br>Plus the new magic gods seem way too informed on Aleister to stick around and help out, even if Aleister one-upped them.</br></br></br>  <br> he didn't read the spoilers </br>  <br>Remember when Kanzaki was relevant?</br>  <br>Every time she's relevant, she beats Touma up.</br>  kamisato part, and yeah, all the magic gods are dead (or teleported or something). Turns out it was so pleasurable to be sucked to death (or teleported) by kamisato, that even full power magic gods just line up to be murdered (or teleported by him). Niang-niang was screaming in ecstasy while being sucked until she was nothing but a flap of skin. And even though Neph saw how terrifying it was, she still have to struggle to stop herself from jumping towards Kamisato's hand madly. Kamisato slowly carved away Neph's flesh until nothing was left, and Neph was too drowned in happiness to stop him. She survived cause a couple of her organs was seperate from her body.<br>And yeah Kamisato called himself a normal highschool boy and pretty much offed all the Majins by himself.<br>Turns out IB (Kamijou) wasn't doing its job right, so WR (kamisato, world rejector, 理想送葬) began to take action.<br><br>According to high priest, academy city functions as a seal for IB, preventing it from properly working, this is why you see the dragon head thing in AC. That's not suppose to happen, and IB not working properly was the reason supernatural powers are all over the place. So high priest try to destroy AC with the comet to release IB, but noukan killed him before that. WR is working properly and was suppose to be a counterpart for IB, one deny fantasy and while the other escapes reality.</br></br></br></br>  <br> AC is a seal for IB <br>thats hella interesting.<br>so crowley is literally screwing his own plan over.</br></br></br>  <br>At least they get to feel extremely good before dying or getting erased out of this universe.</br>  <br> Niang-niang was screaming in ecstasy while being sucked until she was nothing but a flap of skin <br>What is this now, Zashiki Warashi?</br></br>  <br>yup</br>  <br> Casually pulls a final boss move and summons a meteor <br> Gets killed a by a dog first <br>Kamachi pls.</br></br></br>  <br>so one breaks illussions and the other creates one?<br><br>non magical brawl between Touma and Takeru fucking when?</br></br></br>  <br>Kamachi is doing his job right though, im damn hyped for next volume</br>  <br>The spoilers actually said he chimped on the Priest for calling Mikoto useless and a burden.</br>  <br> According to high priest, academy city functions as a seal for IB, preventing it from properly working, this is why you see the dragon head thing in AC. <br><br>No wonder when IB was cut by Fiamma and Invisible Being appeared not a dragon same case with Othinus too<br><br>I guess when you cut Touma's arm on AC it manifest as a dragon<br><br>But will appear as an Invisible Being when cut outside AC</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The first spoilers didn't reveal it, but it is true. Mikotofags in Japan are pretty buttblasted at Touma.</br>  <br> And yeah Kamisato called himself a normal highschool boy <br><br>goddamn this "normal highschool boy" shit!</br></br></br>  <br>That kinda makes sense in light of the Imaginary Number District if you think about it. Kazakiri was forced to come into existence because IB was brought there and could destroy her. It's kind of like a self-aware mechanism that detects the presence of something dangerous, and can be used to act as a seal to contain something very powerful.</br>  <br>Yes, a new info about IB</br>  <br> Mikotofags in Japan are pretty buttblasted at Touma. <br><br>Wait what? Isn't that a good thing? He's saying something positive about mikoto for once? Defending her?</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, now 10 more volumes of nothing happening before we get more another valuable piece of info. <br><br>FUKOU DA</br></br></br>  <br>Apparently he agreed with the High Priest, but in a less harsh way.</br>  <br> Mikotofags in Japan are pretty buttblasted at Touma <br>Got a source for that?<br><br>Are you saying this <br> 僧正に、上条のお荷物だと散々罵られた <br><br>and this <br> 僧正が御坂をバカにするんだけど、それに対して上条が猛烈に反論している<wbr></wbr> <br><br>were fake?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>IB is literally my only reason to not drop this series.  I've gotten tired of the story, damnit Kamachi </br>  <br>Would you rather have another "third category that's neither magician nor Magic God  (I lied) "?</br>  <br>Check 2ch.</br>  <br>fucking kamachi<br><br>do i have wait for hundreds of volumes to know completly what is World Rejector and Imagine Breaker?</br></br></br>  How many more years do think the series will end guys?  <br>What would that be? Magic God Killer?</br>  Misaka Mikoto clenched her fist as she relished the flavor of victory once more.<br><br>Plus, she had an actual goal in mind, unlike that honey-colored succubus.<br><br> honey-colored succubus. <br><br>She sounds great even when you insult her.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Based on Kamachi's comments on the 10th anniversary website, Index won't be stopping before its 20th anniversary unless something terribly bad happens. This is going to become the next Guin Saga in terms of length.</br>  <br>You'll have to do better than that, mon ami.<br><br><br>FOREVER<br> Probably 5 more years. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't really matter. You'll see it yourself when the novel is translated.</br>  <br> This is going to become the next Guin Saga in terms of length. <br>As long as we get an entire novel of Delta Force being Delta Force, I'm cool with it.</br></br>  <br><br>That makes no sense and I have to call bait. <br><br>Anon is right since that is a good thing (Touma getting mad at Priest's comment and ripping him a new one) and fans should be happy. I, for one, would be happy to see Touma do that. Touma understands and personally knows how helpful Mikoto is and what she has done for him. He also knows that in a against against Magic Gods, Mikoto is simply at a huge disadvantage. The fight just isn't in her area. Touma would put it lightly but truthful and not like how Priest writes her off completely.</br></br></br></br>  <br>at least touma was nice on telling her that if she cant do anything then she should run</br>  <br>For stories I likes Zashiki more, for action I like HO more. But damn my autism hold me from dropping Index. Still hoping for Blood Sign translation though.</br>  <br>As if we'd get something as awesome as that. You can count the scene where the threes are together on the entire NT in one finger</br>  <br>you cant escape the kamachi grip<br><br>i swear to god this nigga knows how to plsy and disappoint most of the readers that it looks like stockholm syndrome.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe in his defense of her he used a wrong choice of words that hit her deep. That's all I could think of<br><br><br>What's Zashiki about anyway? Youkai?</br></br></br></br>  <br>And those scenes are always the best of their novel.</br>  <br>Wait what's this about Anti-Touma? Is this a vol 13 thing?</br>  <br> What's Zashiki about anyway? Youkai? <br>Youkai and murder-mysteries surrounding them, basically.</br></br>  <br>Yes the complete opposite of Touma<br><br>His a normal highschool boy called Kamisato Takeru. His neither an esper or a magician but in his right hand posses the ability called World Rejector an ability that creates illussions</br></br></br>  <br>No. He appears out of nowhere in this volume.</br>  <br> That makes no sense and I have to call bait. <br>You still don't know how insane and obsessed fans in Japan can be?<br><br>They will go as far as destroying the all the merchandise of a series if their waifu loses or is implied not to be a virgin.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Is he lucky as shit or something? Do we know where he's been or what he's doing?</br></br>  <br>Laura knew about him beforehand and mocks Aleister because he wasn't aware of his existence.</br>  <br>A deceptive bluffer with absolutely nothing to show for it. St. Germain's case was different because even the reader doubts their existence, but what's one imagined fantasy in a setting full of actual fantasies?</br>  <br> What's Zashiki about anyway? Youkai? <br><br>The Youkai was just there. It's mainly mystery and sometimes murder and that's why I liked it more.<br><br>Though we get a Touma in a form of a dog and no matter how I stay neutral to Touma in Index, I can't help but love the dog in Zashiki</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess his existence is as exclusive to magic as touma's was to science before he crossed over. Is this guy another japanese kid or foreign living in a normal highschool like london or something?</br>  <br>Youkai and mysteries, like  said. Also, lots of perspective switching and meta bullshit, with some horror elements and Kamachi's typical comedy.</br>  <br>I want to hold hands with misaka.</br>  <br>But what's 'another power' that devoured the IT? I thought it was the dragon</br>  So WR creates illusions while IB breaks illusions, right? What's so great about WR then?  Reminder that Touma agrees that Mikoto is useless and a burden.  <br>Yeah he will probably get them all pregnant including the AI.</br>  <br>Magic itself is the act of making illusions reality, the same as esper abilities, right?<br>So he's essentially a magic god, from what I gather.</br></br>  <br>what the fuck is wrong with othinus legs?</br>  <br>it basically gives you your ideal world<br>It gives you utopia and reject reality<br>While IB does the opposite which is letting you face. the harsh reality</br></br></br>  World Rejector is spelled "理想送り".<br><br>The technical functions by sending the Magic Gods into unused area of the world.<br>Magic Gods' dilemma came from the fact there is only one world, and parallel universe does not exist. Yet, there are there so many Magic Gods and phases out there, which is impossible to be satisfied with the resources of just one world.<br>This is also why Magic Gods hide themselves in their own individual phases. As they ultimately realized that their wish can't come true; only one world of resources is never going to fulfill them.<br>This is why Magic Gods want Imagine Breaker. IB can serve as an arbiter between them and govern that limited resources fairly.<br>The very reason why Magic Gods are absolutely powerless before World Rejector. WR is be able to send the Magic Gods into unexplored domain of the world with new resources, the very thing the Magic Gods wanted from the bottom of their heart. Being sucked into WR is like a salvation and dream come true to them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Romaji please</br>  <br><br><br>So it's just not!magic that grants wishes. Kinda stupid. I mean you really really don't need an ability to balance IB, since IB IS the balance to magic. <br><br><br>So this is what it appears to be, when really he's just killing them, right? Or does his hand actually send them somewhere else they can exist?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Risou Okuri, or Ideal Dispatching.</br>  <br>So he dispatch the majin into their ideal world?</br>  <br>Why do magic gods needs WR for that? If all it does is send them to a untouched phase, and magic gods can move between phases at will, why wouldn't they just go from phase to phase until they find it without bothering with WR?</br>  So what happens if Touma and Takeru shake hands or do a hifh five? Will IB negate WR or not?  <br>It will wipe all Esper powers from the earth.</br>  I seriously don't understand how WR based on the contradicting spoiler info we're getting about it.<br> Only one world, no parallel universes. <br> Phases don't count as parallel universes. <br> A phase isn't considered its own world, just part of the world. <br> The world doesn't have enough resources to please multiple magic gods, or even probably just one. <br> WR sends magic gods to an unexplored region of the world. <br>If there's only one world and they're already in it, where exactly is this unexplored area WR sends them to? Why couldn't magic gods access it to begin with then?<br>Is the area they're sent to not considered "rea," or does WR literally create a new place for them to go to?<br><br>The spoiler info seriously seems to be contradicting itself, or just severely lacks explanations where they're needed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This page right?</br>  <br>its all illusion anon</br>  <br>So it claims to send them somewhere else, but in reality they're just dying?</br>  <br>Maybe it sends them into a Klein bottle.</br>  <br>Translate it weebs.</br>  <br>it says your a faggot who cant read moon</br>  <br>It's just a quote from Touma about how Mikoto needs to get back since she's in the way.<br>And then the other 80% is Mikoto monologing how Touma isn't acting like himself. Choosing to run in front of a formidable foe, not trying to use IB when he didn't hesitate to use it on Accelerator, etc.</br></br>  <br>Just wait for js06 to translate the novel</br>  <br>why is biribiri so adorable?</br>  <br> I'll have gone through all of college and one or two jobs after within the time I've read Index til it ends <br>Jesus Christ Kamachi this is too long.</br></br>  <br>I knew it. Touma will go on to play against many nigh immortals as the most high school student who ever high schooled.</br>  <br>At least you have something to look forward while you're in your 30s.</br>  Post Frenda  <br>No.</br>  <br>Were you going to say something more? It seems half your post is missing.</br>  <br>She's dead, jim.</br>  <br>Im starting to think that when Kamachi mentions "normal highschool boy" it just means playing with the trope of common shounen heroes on highschool having powers and plays as a normal highschool boy or all the magical battle harem type normal highschool boy.</br>  <br>Best ITEM still lives in my heart ;_;</br>  <br>Frenda a shit. She's not even the best Seivelun.</br>  What else is /raildex/ reading?  Posting best girl  for me .   Mikoto BTFO <br>Feels good. Did people seriously think Mikoto or any of the other girls stood a chance after Touma and Othinus spent millions of years together?</br>    <br>Syomin Sample, in anime anticipation.  Am I really /raildex/ if I've only been here a week? </br>  <br> BTFO <br>You already said that like 5 hours ago. Come up with better bait, m8.</br></br>  <br>Other Kamachi's work except Blood Sign. Still waiting for js to deliver</br>  <br>It's not even bait. Mikotofags are on suicide watch.</br>  <br>im reading the adventures of papa bones while waiting for god to descend.</br>  <br>Heavy Object</br>  <br> Magic Gods' dilemma came from the fact there is only one world, and parallel universe does not exist <br>Huh  I was actually right . I wonder if we're going into a real parallel world territory now.<br><br>Speaking of parallel world, there's that side game where Aleister appeared and mentioned about parallel world and that Kamachi crossover..<br><br><br>Seems to me that even with infinite amount of phase they can live in, it's ultimately still one world. The unused part of the world is probably more similar to parallel world instead of just normal phase.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I feel dumb for asking, but does anyone have a link where I can download NT12 pdf?<br><br>I can't find one anywhere.</br></br>  <br>I'm not sure if one ever got made, since BTs pdf generator has been down for months. You could get the epub and convert it, I guess.</br>  <br>Try google.</br>  <br>You should be able to convert it in calibre.</br>  <br>Oh pfft, never mind the one I grabbed from our raildex folder appears to be pdf already. I'll upload it for you.</br>  <br> https://mega.co.nz/#!9g1HEYJT!fcJc7<wbr>apSm_Uk2y2auD01H13FN7RQGABUNIJs8Upc<wbr>HPE</wbr></wbr> <br>.</br></br>  <br> Implying I didn't spend the best part of an hour excercising my google-fu skills before resorting to something as shameful as asking for help on /a/ <br><br><br><br>Thanks</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The thing is, apparently both Anti-Touma and Neph declare there's no such thing as parallel worlds.<br>So whatever the fuck happens to them is just confusing. Hopefully our loli and savior js06 can save us.</br></br>  <br> implying we would want to read shit that got an anime rather than index s3 </br>  <br>It doesn't matter if you've done it already you will always get smartass "use google" answer. Glad I've never asked a question on where to find something here</br>  <br>Haha this is too good. Well I was waiting for something like this. Now we have a true archnemesis for Touma. This would honestly be perfect as a final boss.</br>  <br>He will probably just be used as a tool to get Touma to understand what exactly IB is. The final boss will surely be Aleister.</br>  <br>Of course, I just think Anti-Touma would be better.</br>  <br>He's more of an archrival, don't you think? The rival is never the final boss, just the guy who stands in front of the final boss's door.<br>Or sometimes they temporarily team up.</br></br>  <br>Anti-Touma will either be the worst or the best thing that has ever happened in this series. It pretty much all depends on NT14. I honestly thing he was added to the story a little late.</br>  The whole "Anti-Touma" just sounds so dumb that I've decided to deny everything until I've read the book myself.  <br>Ah,ok so this is the origin of misunderstanding.<br>That sure is written in the way Touma talks and says Mikoto is useless, but in that scene 『』is High Priest's line, so this is his line mimicing Touma's tone.<br>Touma never ever said she is useless.</br></br></br>  <br>Quiet, you. You're not allowed to do anything but trash Mikoto and praise Othinus here. Not shipping is also not allowed.</br>  <br><br>O-Ok</br></br>  <br>In all seriousness though. People are getting retarded with the shipping. It needs to stop.</br>  <br>Apparently you don't know how power levels work in raildex.<br><br>You don't improve unless you have the capacity to hit 3+ and, even if you do, you still don't without crowley deciding its in his interests for that to happen.</br></br></br>  <br> Unless Kamisato is really about to play Aleister for a fool, shouldn't he be considered the main character since he's responsible for pretty much everything that happens in this story in some way?</br>  <br>I don't know I mean he's literally the opposite of Touma. He's everything that Touma stands against right? To me from a thematic point of view it makes the most sense for someone like that to be the final boss. It's the final illusion Touma needs to break to validate his convictions/beliefs, to validate his existence and ensure that everything he's done is right for himself and others. I feel instead of doing that whole protect othinus boss rush we should've just had Touma face off against Anti-Touma in NT 10.</br>  <br>But if NT10 hadn't happened, how would he have pandered to waifu-shipperfags?</br>  Why does kamachi hate lolis?  <br> Majority of the LN has pandered more towards loli and petite dfc in general <br> Even his favorite is Birdway <br>Too bad for you he doesn't, LRD.</br></br></br>  will she died?  <br>Because only sexy and mature girls are allowed to accomplish things in Raildex. Only sexy and mature girls are allowed to be preferred by Touma.<br><br>Lolis are only there to make loli fans suffer.</br></br></br>  <br>If she does it'll be closer to the end of NT as a set up for the finale, like when Index was kidnapped at the end of English Civil War.</br>  <br>Not sure why Misaka would be special in this regard. The last book had Touma trying to stop Shiggy from directly opposing who he thought was a magic god. This isn't about particular characters' usefulness and whatnot. Touma knows what those guys are capable of and is in full PTSD mode.<br><br>Even if a magic god went after Last Order, Touma would still try to talk even Accel out of trying to fight them directly.</br></br></br>  Wait are there spoilers already?  <br>I'm surprised the Magic Gods didn't go after Last Order/The Sisters/The Network. In NT10, Will is described as being in an "unknown place". If they are after new territory, wouldn't they want that? It's possible they don't know about it or it was lower on their priority list</br>  I tried watching the first few episodes of Railgun.<br><br>Does the SoL shit ever end? I liked the Esper vigilante feel of the series but every time things get exciting again the SoL shows up and kills it.</br></br>  <br> Already <br>The volume has been out for a bit, of course there's spoilers</br></br>  <br>just skip anything that isn't written by Kamachi<br><br>Nagai filler is cancer</br></br></br>  <br>The first 8 episodes of railgun are a bit shit, after that it gets better.</br>  <br>Same reason I never watched Railgun except Sister arc</br>  When did JC staff get so competent. They're fucking doing three anime this season. Three! It's like they're mocking us saying they don't need to rely on Raildex.  So since Kamisato takeru is the complete opposite touma then does this mean that his an alpha? even his right hand were able to kill with please  <br>No, he's a normal highschool student who actively hunts magic gods. The key point is he's normal.</br>  <br>I would assume it means he's incredibly lucky but no girls are attracted to him.</br>  <br>yea but the spoiler said he appeared because<br>Touma didn´t do his job right.</br></br>  <br>Give the nigga a break will ya, he got amnesia and everyone shoving their problem to him. Though I doubt pre-amnesia Touma will do his 'job' right</br>  <br> he watches an objectively shitty series and complains about it <br>You're such a dumb boy.</br></br>  <br>The actual parts adapted from the manga aren't shitty though. Only filler is shit.</br>  <br> literally fixing every single god damn thing on the planet is toumas job <br>i swear to fuck kamachi hates touma's character and wants nothing more then to torture the poor bastard.<br>what a sadistic fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>I think the Kamisato is inferior to Touma.<br>if I clean up my room the kamijou methode<br>would be to destroy the trash.But kamisato basically just hide it under the bed.<br>if you know what i mean.</br></br></br></br>   Accel didn't get to kill a magic god before they were removed <br>fuck</br>  <br>i have this weird feeling accelerator is gonna return just to destroy kamisato to essentially make up for the fact that every time he fights touma he gets his shit kicked in.<br><br><br>also i swear even as an othinusfag, i kind of want her to die just so touma goes nuts and just massacres the shit out of just all these dickheads in charge, just let him rampage all over academy city and london and just trample the shit out of the fuckwits that are crowley and laura.</br></br></br></br>  <br> also i swear even as an othinusfag, i kind of want her to die <br>A good death that has major plot implications is much better than floating in haremspace.</br></br>   A certain boy’s name came to mind as Laura toyed with the piece’s head using her finger. <br> “What ‘this’ does may just determine what happens.” <br><br>kamachi went Kubo tier.</br></br></br>  <br>I want an Accelerator/Misaka clone/original Misaka team up to fuck up Crowley. Touma can fuck Laura up</br>  <br> touma goes nuts and just massacres <br>No i would love it if it was more of a cold wraith<br>and a little Mafia like.A cool Demon lord Touma.</br></br></br>  <br>I will be happy with whatever as long as Othinus dies</br>  <br> turned out we get 30 something volume to develop Touma into the final villain <br> Kamisato took the role of Hero <br><br>What would your reaction be?</br></br></br></br>  <br>i kind of liked how he was in volume 2 of OT where he went full nuts and just scared the shit out of everyone while he proceeds to do horrifying shit.<br>thats ultimately how i could see it.</br></br>  <br>i'd be pissed because that means crowley and laura wins.<br>they really don't deserve the win for all their bullshit.</br></br>  WHEN WILL IT END.. i truly want Raildex to end.<br><br><br>The first book series had such a good ending.<br><br>I JUST WANT IT TO END AT A GOOD point.<br><br><br>but just like all entertainment.<br><br>They are going to burn it all into obscurity.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What's inside IB shows up as a dragon head when it's in AC <br>Holy Christ, some old specula ended up being true</br></br>  <br>This. I want the main series to end already. Let the side mangas continue for a bit and then end them too.</br>  <br>WW3 was the perfect end point and we're way past it.</br>  <br>WW3 was never going to be the end because we all knew crowley was keikaku as fuck and he hadn't done anything.</br>  <br>what is AC?</br>  <br>Academy City, you slow anon</br>  <br>I agree. Kamachi shouldn't have created so many loose ends and should have ended it with WWIII and an epilogue novel.</br>  I think his power is the Manipulation of phasen.<br>when he use his Power this happened<br> it seemed like something was wavering like a mirage. <br>the same thing is with his AIm field.<br> the AIM diffusion field around this guy was rather unstable. Even <br> when he was not doing anything obvious, she still couldn't visualise him in this state. <br> Maybe there was some power obstructing the sighting of the AIM diffusion field. <br>He is like ollerus who changed his Mana into something Inexplainable.<br>And he said about his Power:<br> "Well, my ability is still baseless! It expands endlessly! <br>I am just guessing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>thanks quick anon</br>  <br>Every single volume people say Mikoto is BTFO when spoilers are dropped, but the opposite happens when someone fucking translates it. Aren't people getting sick of this same song and dance every 3-4 months? Expecting Kamachi to trash Mikoto is like Takeuchi suddenly deciding he doesn't want to draw Saber. It's never going to happen.</br>  <br>Now that this is confirmed, it probably works similar to the defense system Aleister installed on Aiwass. Meaning, Aleister has limited control on the Invisible Thing while inside AC.</br>  <br>You're a terrible businessman.<br><br>This shit sells like hotcakes, ending it would be like</br></br></br>  <br>if thats the case hes even more broken then accelerator by alot.<br>just god damn.</br></br>  <br> like Takeuchi suddenly deciding he doesn't want to draw Saber. <br>H-he got over the meidos so maybe one day he'll finally grow sick of Sabers?</br></br>  <br>Raildex is fun, so even if it goes on forever I'll be happy, though I want more magic side stories with Kanzaki, or Mark</br>  <br>Holy shit the amnesia,the constant involvement on accidentts and the suffering in nt9 didnt give you a hint?</br>  <br>If you truly love a character you'll make them suffer as much as possible, because through suffering you see many more facets and changes to them</br>  <br>Meido Sabers, anon.</br>  <br><br> Hamazura the only one realizing how broken Touma's mind is <br><br>Huh?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It is fun. I wish discussing it was as fun as reading it. Too many people in this fanbase are missing the point and taking shit way too seriously. It makes me incredibly depressed.</br>  <br><br>Agreed.</br></br>  <br>I can partially prove it.<br>this happened when accelertor tried to block Magic<br> He held up his right hand, the sole area his reflection was activated on. <br> The water spear was smashed to pieces. <br> The water turned to a rainbow of light that flowed diagonally back from &gt;his right hand <br>and this happened in SS2<br> The mysterious guts guy naming himself Sogiita spread his arms wide, bent his back like <br> a bow, and announced this to the heavens. Haratani didn’t know how it worked, but an <br> explosion of colorful red, blue, and yellow smoke appeared behind him. <br>And the same thing happened in fanfare.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking kamachi.</br>  <br><br>Thats the thing with 4chan. This is simultaneously the best and worst place to discuss chinese cartoons. We could have civil conversation on some other forum, but it would be filled with fucking faggots and the conversation isnt nearly as intelligent. Then again, it would be nice not to see purposefully hateful shitposting and samefaggotry</br></br>  <br>More like the sales are getting worse every volume. By the time this shit ends shit ain't even gonna be selling over 50k volumes.</br>  <br>It's nice whenever we all stop focusing on shipping shit, and just go wild and make jokes or discuss newly translated chapters</br>  <br><br>It's almost as if long running series gradually go down in sales over time or something!</br></br>  <br>And S3 will advertise it...right?</br>  Illustrations where  So Othi-cha powerless or not.<br>It makes as much sense she is powerless<br>than she is not.if she has the power than ther is no need to use it because of that 50/50 bullshit.<br>also if she want that live to be as it is it´s better to pretend to be powerless.</br></br></br>  <br>She was able to project herself into Norse Mythology world in crossover.<br>So she isn't that powerless.</br></br>  Can we all just take a moment to take in the radiant beauty that is our grace, Ruiko Saten.  <br>Oh, so that slut's name was Ruiko.</br>  <br>yea but the phase asgard also exist in Toaru universe so she be able to do that even<br>here.By the way if Othinius is Odin who is ruling asgard at this moment.</br></br>  <br> Crossover  <br> Canon <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  Can you guys tell me what you me by "Nuit"?  <br>true loli hestia</br>  <br>But crossover is canon.<br> At least for Waltraute's world. </br></br>  <br>mean*</br>  <br>nuit mean night in french</br>  <br>and its absurd enough for a simple survey.</br>  <br>And what is the context here? I don't get it.</br>  <br>IRL Aleister Crowley is the founder of Thelema, a religion with it's own gods. It's main book, The Book of the Law is an important grimore in-universe of Raildex. In the book, there are 3 gods, Nuit, Hadit and a guy with a long name I forgot. It's enough information for you to continue your research on google. Basically Misaka is/will be Nuit, and Accel might be Hadit.</br>  <br>Quenser and Heivia was stupid enough for a Heavy Object.</br>  <br>In Raildex becoming a god means to be killed/fairyed.<br>So Misaka becoming a shitty fairy when?</br></br>  <br>And then Kakine will be the other guy, right?<br>Kakine's still important, right?<br>Right, guys?</br></br></br>  <br>funny hoe she is called a a failure yet she was able to pull touma from another universe by tracing him and setting her existence as the end point. Even if its not canon it fucking complicates how their is only "one worl" but different phases shit.</br>  <br>Kakine has the best esper ability in AC.</br>  Who's your mistress, /a/?  <br>You.</br>  Madoka  Coffee stirring loli is.  Is that supposed to be a dick? Why does it have point things on it.  Clesta is a fucking god.  <br>Pathetic. Know your place, anon.</br>  This girl  <br>Why do Nips push the sub/dom thing so much</br>  Why is femdom so sexy?  <br>It started off really good but the femdom is supposed to increase in intensity over the course of the story, not decline.<br><br>At the end of the doujin it was basically a vanilla love story. Fuck that.</br></br></br>    <br>Oh yes</br>  <br>Are you blind? That's a face.</br>      <br><br>The best part about this is that she didn't go all deredere like they usually do, to pander to the otaku's insecurity about women actually being vulnerable deep down inside. When a woman starts out as an S, I want her to stay S.</br></br>  Worst fetish.  Threadly reminder that femdom is worse than NTR.<br><br>If you actually want a girl to beat the shit out of you while spitting in your mouth and calling you worthless you're pathetic.</br></br>  The best.  <br>Amen to that my brother. Fuck role reversal.</br>          <br>What if I like both, does it multiply?</br>    <br><br><br><br>More legs</br></br></br></br>  <br>You have a very wrong idea of what femdom's about.</br>    <br>Nemesis, Mea and Momo would make good mistresses<br>Good Mistresses are those who know you already got a wife, but would still love you and want to make a harem</br></br>    <br>This girl is pretty fantastic. Not sure if I want her or Moka though. Hard to choose.</br>  My waifu of course.          <br><br>Erina femdom doujin, when?</br></br>  <br>I wish she was actually relevant ;_;</br>   /a/ suddenly likes femdom  <br><br>is this some new meme?</br></br>  <br>It isn't. You are just an emasculated betacuck.</br>   tfw no mistress   <br>Welcome to your first week on /a/ my friend. Tell you friends from /b/ to come over too!</br>   Have a femdom fetish <br> End with a sub waifu <br>I don't know how it happened</br></br>  <br>Lurk moar. <br><br><br> "Manly men have to be the strong one no matter what! Women are inferior to men!" the post </br></br></br></br>   mistress <br> not pet <br><br>femdomfags gtfo</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Who let all the insecure denial-fags in?</br></br></br></br></br>  The best kind of mistress is the one that will bend over submissively and spread her legs for you, knowing that you're addicted to her and will obey her every command.  <br>Thats just normal 3D bitch</br>  <br>Only if you're weak enough to let that happen. <br>Everything is 3D, if you look at it the wrong way.</br></br>  <br>It's rare for a woman to be born the Alpha and actually want and enjoy the position with all it entails.<br><br>People are drawn to rarity, uniqueness, things that separate them from the masses. A girl who wants to be the breadwinner, the top earner and leader of the household, who wants a servile man to service her and her alone and treats her "pet" with kindness and love, these are rare given our evolution.<br><br>So to find a girl who wishes to dominate her man instead of the other way around is sexy. People pay good money just to be in the presence of these types of women. So femdom is sexy as fuck, and that's coming from a dude who wants the dominate position. I may wish to dom, but I respect the subs out there who'd love nothing more than to lick the feet of their woman and please her at her leisure over their own.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Brofist my brothers.</br></br>  <br>He actually has the right idea. Fuck those "gentle femdom" babies.</br>  <br>Help a fellow anon and give sauce?

Please tell me you're a girl!</br>    <br>Does she make appearance in the anime?</br>    <br>I don't understand how people would like social femdom. For me it begins on bed and ends on bed.</br>  <br>But I AM pathetic</br>      I don't see Rin as the mistress type.  <br>Someone needs to make a Luvia x Rin femdom doujin already.<br><br>I want to self insert into Rin and be brutally humiliated by my hated rival already.</br></br></br>  My Queen.  I want Haruka-sama to take me to her basement so she can step on me and let me lick her feet!    <br>I'm still mad</br>  <br>Did she get implants or why are her tits no longer tiny?</br>  <br>Social femdom doesn't work out due to, again, evolutionary concerns if taken to extremes. We're suffering that extreme right now, by and large women are not suited for true leadership yet society has been structured such that they are now essentially expected to be the default leaders. Challenge this directly, and you will end up in jail being raped by Jamal and Bubba.<br><br>We see the consequences all around us, it doesn't work. Perhaps one day it will, but today is not that day. Still, doesn't mean there aren't women out there who like to dominate yet don't also hate men and realize they're weird, accept it, and roll with it. They're just exceedingly rare, hence why femdom is considered degenerate yet we find it sexy as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>Sauce?</br>  <br>Nice to know there's more tumblr persons like me here!<br>followed.</br></br>  <br>Not yet, no.</br>  <br>Impeccable taste, lad.</br>  <br> And then she became a cat.

This is done just for the sake of humiliation, and there's no way I can enjoy something like that. <br>For me it's the idea of so madly in love with the girl you practically worship her and willing to do anything for her.

Maybe I'm just not using the right tags though.</br></br>  <br>Nagatoro is alright, but I could do with less physical violence. I'd rather be humiliated and raped than beaten.</br>  <br>That means the girl doesn't deserve to be worshipped.<br>Genuine Goddess would make the dick fall for her instead.</br></br>  I want Erina to dominate me.    <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>This.

For instance, "hen" is used in Spanish (piel de gallina), Portuguese (pele de galinha), Romanian (piele de găină), French (chair de poule) and Catalan (pell de gallina). "Chicken" is used in Dutch (kippenvel), Chinese (雞皮疙瘩, lit. lumps on chicken skin), Finnish (kananliha), Estonian (kananahk), Afrikaans (hoendervleis) and Korean (닭살, daksal). In Hindi/Urdu it is called rongtey khade ho jaana. The equivalent Japanese term, 鳥肌, torihada, translates literally as "bird skin". In Arabic it is called kash'arirah, while in Hebrew it is called "duck skin" (עור ברווז). </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The last three or so Nadia episodes also had me at a constant state of goosebumps.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lDu<wbr>nGtlNQVY</wbr>  [ ]<br>Couldn't find the original but what the heck.</br></br></br>  <br>The OP pic totally looks like a side shot of an erect penis.</br>  <br>In Hebrew it's "Duck skin".</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=si-<wbr>Ck6E6c24</wbr>  [ ]<br>Every time.</br>  <br> chickenskin <br>Gross.

Most people who don't like the arc fall into the former camp.</br></br>  <br>Maybe they wanted a normal battle manga arc where the good guys beat the bad guys in a final showdown, and not the bad guy gets nuked.<br><br>Its a really good arc, and not just in HxH but just overall in manga of the kind.</br></br></br>  <br>Not the O. I really liked the chimera ant arc, but it's partially because I followed the manga. 3 episodes for rushing the stairwell felt lightning fast compared to 3 chapters for rushing the stairwell + more than a year of hiatus.</br>   Most people who don't like the arc (watched the arc as it aired) <br>Agree with anonymous, the pacing was a bit off. Agree with OP that plot and overall arc was good, but as said previously, spreading out of scene in anime is pretty bad. Manga might be okay, will check out</br>  <br>*OP</br>  I can imagine the pacing (when it was airing) being infuriating. Also too much time dedicated to explaining shit like Knuckle's weird leeching power that barely affects the story.<br><br>That being said (under the presumption that the Madhouse anime never continues), I think it makes a fine dramatic climax to the series with the election arc working as an epilogue. Ging's motives are revealed and Gon gets an open ending as he is given one more chance after being reset to square one.</br></br>  <br>  There are people who didn't like the slow pacing. <br><br>All those juicy extra details from the narrator is what made the best parts in the arc what they truly were.</br></br></br>  <br>Stalled the manga for 10 years and introduced a bunch of new characters who started out interesting but ultimately were there to be tossed around by the plot and/or prove narrative points.<br><br>Also, Kite died.</br></br></br>  There is so much good stuff in CA that I can forgive all of its negative traits.  gotta agree, kite dying is one of the reasons why i really don't like CA<br>but will still admit that CA was a good arc, just poorly paced</br>  <br>Chimera ant is a self-contained story that uses characters from hunter x hunter and further develops them in what's essentially an entirely new world. More manga should try this actually.</br>   Bad pacing (in both the anime and manga) <br> The antagonists are all shit characters. On top of being unlikable and uninteresting their only traits are being OP and loving their King who is also dull as dirt <br> Gon and company aren't particularly relevant  <br> Too fucking long <br> Anti-climatic ending <br><br>Not sure what Togashi was thinking when he conceived this arc though he doesn't seem to think things through at all in most cases (see YuYu Hakusho) but this arc ran itself dry. The election arc was a much needed breather and gave us a much more interesting setting and antagonist and even the Dark Continent arc is looking good. <br><br><br> self-contained <br>Given how all the consequences of that arc plays a role in the election arc and then again in the DC arc its anything but self-contained.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pouf was interesting, the rest of them were meh-tier though</br>  Better question is why people like it and consider it the best arc in the series.  <br> Meruem <br> dull <br>You're onion is irrelevant.</br></br></br>  <br><br>kite dying was important. he was extremely likeable and 'cool', a typical fan favorite character; the audience could then get on gon's side and understand his rage when pitou killed him.</br></br>  <br> Pouf <br>Eh...he was okay, gay as fuck but at least had a personality.</br></br>  <br>It appeals to edgy teenagers</br>  <br><br>because netero summons a buddha, killua goes super saiyan and gon quite literally becomes a man.</br></br>  <br>Personally, I don't hate it, but I don't really like it either. It was long and too drawn out, when the arc could have been concluded in half the amount of chapters. Togashi did a lot of building for the arc, but I'm not sure all of it was necessarily needed.</br>  <br>It transplants the main characters into a new setting. It's self-contained because all the important characters except for the main ones have their conflicts resolved.<br><br> The antagonists are all shit characters. On top of being unlikable and uninteresting their only traits are being OP and loving their King who is also dull as dirt <br>Seriously? Is this bait?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes my onion is irrelevant to this discussion but it doesn't change the fact that Meruem was a dull character.</br>  <br> It's self-contained because all the important characters except for the main ones have their conflicts resolved. <br>Gon and Killua have their conflicts resolve retards<br><br> LEL BAIT MEME <br><br>How about you make an argument instead of pretending that there was nothing wrong with the characters like a retard.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Meruem was the protagonist though.</br>  <br>That's not what self-contained means dumbass.</br>  <br>Go be stupid somewhere else.</br>  teenage fangirls hate it because it doesn't include hisoka/chrollo/kurapika<br><br>fujoshits hate it because it 'ruined' precious little gon<br><br>true men realize the greatness of the arc and admire netero's badassery</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rationalizing over a hundred pages of an arc by stuff that happens in the last 3rd doesn't mean it's good, it means it had some decent action</br>  <br> make an argument <br> let's use ad hominem to set a good example <br><br>Good job shitposter-kun</br></br></br></br>  <br> Gon and Killua have their conflicts resolve retards <br>Doesn't that make it even more self-contained?<br><br> How about you make an argument instead of pretending that there was nothing wrong with the characters like a retard. <br>I really liked the characters so I actually wasn't sure you weren't baiting. Pitou, Youpi, and the king all have personalities that change drastically in different ways and I found it interesting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The antagonists are all shit characters. On top of being unlikable and uninteresting their only traits are being OP and loving their King who is also dull as dirt <br><br>This is the main reason I couldn't stand this arc. The Chimera Ants themselves are shit characters and its even worse when they take up the majority of screentime. I never really had this problem with any other arc but this one.</br></br></br>  <br>About a third of the arc is from his point of view, and his character development is what drives the events.</br>  <br> Doesn't that make it even more self-contained? <br>No? Because the events that transpired in that arc have an profound effect on both of them mentally and physically. Its not something they can easily forget like nothing.<br><br>  Pitou, Youpi, and the king all have personalities that change drastically in different ways and I found it interesting. <br><br>None of them have personalities. Pitou and Youpi are all about MUH KING throughout the entire arc and Meruem is just a dull character.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> About a third of the arc is from his point of view <br>Try less than a third. He's absent for the majority of it until his confrontation with Netereo.</br></br>  <br> About a third of the arc is from his point of view, and his character development is what drives the events. <br>I'm glad I finished this arc recently because now I can weed out all the bullshit shitposters like this to know that all the "Meruem is such a good character" are from edgy teenagers.</br></br>   tfw ADD <br> tfw this arc </br>  Don't know how the pacing is in the anime but the pacing of the attack on the palace in the manga is what makes it perfect.<br>All battles are part of the character development and their result depend heavily on these developments and small split second decisions that end up affecting the whole assault situation. And that's when the concept of nen battle really starts to make sense, mindgames and mental state can and will decide the outcome.<br>This arc (and especially the assault part) was the best thing I've ever read in shonen manga.</br></br>    there's multiple reasons people wouldn't like it<br><br>some people were even starting to get on pitou's side and feel sorry for her, when she's fixing up komugi you see that she really is just a guard doing her job, that was all she killed kite for, protecting her king. so there was a window of opportunity for her to have some development and realize that kite was to gon what komugi was to the king, but instead the arc ended with gon smashing her head to pieces.</br></br>  <br>It killed Kite to test its strength, not protect the king.</br>  detailed review explaining the flaws of CA arc<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dEt<wbr>m_Q2LK9g</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Don't try to argue with waifufags</br>  <br> No? Because the events that transpired in that arc have an profound effect on both of them mentally and physically. Its not something they can easily forget like nothing. <br>I wasn't agreeing with the original statement that their conflicts were resolved. It's continued development for the main characters as you'd expect from any normal arc, but in this case they become secondary characters as the main conflict gets larger in scale. I think it's an interesting way of having events unfold, but I can understand people being frustrated by focus being taken away from them.<br><br> Pitou and Youpi are all about MUH KING throughout the entire arc and Meruem is just a dull character. <br>That was the whole point though, right? The ants are a species that doesn't value individual personalities since the king is the race's ultimate accomplishment. But through interacting with humans, all of them start to struggle with reconciling their personalities with the simplicity of what ants' existences are supposed to be. And even though he was literally made to rule the world, meruem eventually concludes that he lived for playing gungi with the blind girl.<br><br>tl;dr I guess I'm not as invested in the character's being quirky and individualistic if the author is trying to make a point with them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pitou was biologically programmed to only think of the King. Pitou can't sympathize nor empathize, and just because it was able to recognize Komugi's worth to Meruem, that says nothing to whether or not it was actually able to 'understand' those feelings.<br>It killed Kite for fun, and its apology to Gon for doing so was hallow and held no worth.</br></br>  <br>Meruem was a trash character. He didn't even drive his own arc, he was simply being swept along along by the plot. And the existence of the Royal ants meant jack shit because they never lived long enough to truly become compelling characters.</br>  <br> About a third of the arc is from his point of view, and his character development is what drives the events. <br><br>His character development has no effect on events. The outcome was predetermined. Like, if the Royal Guards would have been able to help him against Netero that just would have ended in all of them one-shotted by the Rose Bomb. (Accidentally the fact that the only purpose of everything that happened around the palace was giving Netero a chance to have fun one last time is one of the reasons why the arc ended up unfulfilling.) Had Meruem remained without any development whatsoever, at most a few more side characters would be dead by the end.</br></br></br>  <br> he was simply being swept along along by the plot <br>That's a good way of putting it: he was in a really high position by virtue of his existence, but he was basically a baby to start out with. So important plot points like pouf being forced to retract his en to deal with meruem's gungi tantrum are all caused by meruem, not because of his personality, but because of the contrast between his high position and his just-developing personality. The fact that the royal ants die just as they're getting interesting shows how doomed an ant civilization with human values is, since it's because of their personal feelings that they all fuck up and die.<br><br>Anyway, I said why I like the arc already but if you disagree I won't say you're wrong.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Accidentally the fact that the only purpose of everything that happened around the palace was giving Netero a chance to have fun one last time is one of the reasons why the arc ended up unfulfilling. <br>Do you mean the fact that they didn't just nuke everyone because they wanted to give Netero a chance for fun? I thought it was an espionage mission to defeat the ants and save the citizens, and if it didn't work they would have nuked everyone. So it's not like they did the mission for no reason.</br></br>  <br> was biologically programmed to only think of the King. <br><br>Let's give the arc justice where it deserves - half of it is various ants struggling with their biological programming, coming to terms with it or rejecting it. Pouf, for example, doesn't care about Meruem, only about his idea of what a King should be. Pitou, on the other hand, does. Of all the guards she's the genuinely loyal one, and that's why she dies - even we are not sure if she is genuinely remorseful for her "sorry, I lied about healing Kite, now pls die for the sake of my King, Gon ", but he could only see her as the most duplicitous, blackest-hearted villain he ever encountered, one bad enough to say "fuck everything, I don't care what happens to me if only I can kill this bitch".</br></br></br>  <br> but he could only see her as the most duplicitous, blackest-hearted villain he ever encountered, one bad enough to say "fuck everything, I don't care what happens to me if only I can kill this bitch". <br>That fanfiction, holy shit</br></br>  <br> that reaction image <br>It's so polished</br></br>  <br>It was made by a talented artist, so of course.</br>  <br> Do you mean the fact that they didn't just nuke everyone because they wanted to give Netero a chance for fun? I thought it was an espionage mission to defeat the ants and save the citizens, and if it didn't work they would have nuked everyone. <br><br>Why Netero had only brought a posse of relatively weak Hunters and kids with him? Why if he hired Zoldyks to assist, their only part was ensuring that he gets his alone time with the King, even though both of the older Zoldyks were considerably stronger than everyone else in his posse, and possibly even strong enough to fight Royal Guards on equal grounds (judging as a captain-level ant who gave some trouble to one of Netero's hunters got casually one-shotted by them)?<br><br>Add the fact that Netero plainly did not give a fuck about things like Hisoka and Killua murdering other Hunter exam candidates for the hell of it or Illumi threatening Killua right before his eyes, and just didn't seem like the sort of person to go through the trouble for the sake of people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fantastic.</br>  <br>Nah, all the guards were defective. Pitou failed as a royal guard the moment they willingly nurtured the King's humanity. That was not their duty.</br>  <br> That fanfiction <br><br>That was what literally happened, though.</br></br></br>  <br> relatively weak Hunters and kids <br>I was under the impression that his two students and their students were among the best hunters around. The kids came along for personal reasons and, honestly, you're right, he probably shouldn't have taken them along. They ended up being very useful though.<br><br> Zoldyks <br>This isn't stated in canon anywhere, but I assume that like every military operation in the real world there's a budget for it. And considering that it was a 'hopeful thinking' alternative to nuking a bunch of 3rd world citizens, they might not have been able to afford more than one Zoldyk. And the one that came along was as a favor anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Madhouse.</br>  what's your favorite moment in the manga?  <br> Why Netero had only brought a posse of relatively weak Hunters and kids with him? <br><br>if shit went REALLY wrong netero would have had to activate his nuke closer to the palace and possibly kill off a load of top-class hunters.</br></br></br>  <br>Anytime Chrollo looks moe.</br>  Why do I have the feeling that Aokiji is either working as a spy for Akainu or that we will get a flashback of the time those two meet for the first time?  <br><br>i wonder if he'll give Kyros a leg though</br></br>  <br>Nigga you cant even spell sword.
