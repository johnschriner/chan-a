[ Why do I have the feeling that Aokiji is either working as a spy for Akainu or that we will get a flashback of the time those two meet for the first time?  <br>They were fighting over who gets to be the spy doing awesome stuff and who gets stuck back jn HQ doing paperwork and dealing with the beaurocracy.<br><br>The twist is that Akainu lost the battle, and he's supremely pissed about being relegated to basically a desk job.</br></br></br>  <br>I feel like Kuzan probably told Sakazuki that he was going to free roam and sort out justice in his own way (ie taking out some of the remaining level 6 prisoners). If he did or didn't tell Sakazuki, I feel like Kuzan's just doing it to break down BB pirates from the inside, or use their strength to pick off other pirates more efficiently.</br>  Meanwhile, Kizaru is just now realising he hasn't seen any blue or red guys for a while.  <br>Kizaru is so fucking based</br>  Working for himself to undermine the BB pirates because the marines' hands are tied due to political bullshit.<br><br>This will lead into a collective mistrust amongst the BB pirates as compared to the SHs.<br>The collective trust of the SH will prove what is necessary to win One Piece in the crucial moment...all shounen ever.<br><br>Should be obvious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Kizaru probably has a full moustache or something similar now</br></br>  Soon  <br>What exactly is going on here</br>  <br>some jurassic park movie meme shit</br>  <br>Jurassic World meme</br>  Why didn't they just fly the dragons to one piece?  <br>These guys don't look like they're easily fucked with.<br>Kidd better have a hell of a plan.</br></br>  <br><br> out-planning Beckmann <br><br>Good luck, he probably has a million traps set up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>These guys don't either.<br><br>The yonkou in the end will have red hair, one arm and a scar on his face. My bet is it wont be Shanks.</br></br></br>  <br>Film Z has proved that he stays the same.</br>  <br>im sorry but Guy Manuel, Mr. Glasgow and a giant cockroach arent about to beat Shanks and crew<br><br>None of them will get past Lucky Roux, let alone the rest of his main posse</br></br></br>  <br>Kidd is one of the few pirate captains to have a proper pirate captain's coat.<br>I'll give him that.</br></br>  <br>The cross-eyed guy holding his sword the wrong way and glaring at the monkey will forever make me laugh</br>  <br>If Kid's alliance can't beat a yonkou, then what chance does Luffy's alliance (which is currently weaker than Kid's) have of taking down one or more? Kid is Luffy's primary rival of their generation; basically what Shiki was to Roger.</br>  <br>Yeah it's heavily implied, aokiji lost to akainu on purpose but had to make it convincing so he lost the leg. The former admiral knew he needed an informant on the inside and he couldn't be in the public eye so he had to step down to be the the guy Aokiji would report to. I think Akainu has no idea or was kept in the dark and he found out eventually and he's pissy about it. <br><br>It's funny how after lengthy arcs it's the aftermath of the arc that's the most interesting</br></br></br>  <br><br> which is currently weaker than Kid's <br><br>Stop thinking it is just Luffy and Law now - FI and Dressrosa have shown that.<br><br>Unless Kid also has a growing fleet out of his ass, he's not going to beat a Yonkou, that's the difference.<br><br>Just watch, Luffy will gain more and more allies, that's how he beat Doffy, and it's how he will beat his enemies in the NW.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> a yonkou <br><br>Shanks isnt just 'a yonkou'<br><br>It's not like they're all equal strength because some assholes in suits gave them a name. I'm willing to bet the only reason Shanks isn't absolutely ruling the seas is because he doesnt have ambitions of world domination</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>BB is actually pretty smart, if any thing BB is using Aokiji to get to the former admiral, I forget his name! The man with the goat!</br>  <br>Except he wears turtlenecks now.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-CI<wbr>s3jOnfiM</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Why doesn't Kid just make a robo-arm for Shanks and trade it to him for his status as a Yonkou?</br>  <br>I think it's weird to still use power levels on this manga. Yes there is a strength barrier, but this manga has shown you don't need strength to win. Ceasar beat luffy by sucking away the air. He's weak as fuck.</br>  <br>Because they are non-canon.</br>  <br> The cross-eyed guy holding his sword the wrong way <br>I can actually see it falling out while he's standing there.<br><br>"For fucks sake Steve we're trying to intimidate BB and the marines. Pick your fucking sword up"<br>"We should have left you on the ship"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>This stuff blows.

Just like Rayleigh, right?</br>  <br>Oh man, that would be awesome</br>  <br>yes?</br>  nobles are hated by general population because they're faggots and looks like marine doesn't like them very much either, what prevents admirals to remove tenryubito?  <br><br>I think it was mentioned yesterday - the "National Treasure" is probably an Ancient Weapon maybe.</br></br>  <br>because kid is dragon ball power level number times below yonkou level and if it happened kaido would just double his territory</br>  <br>Oh, you are from the crowd thinking if a character ever used a sord, they must be a sordman.<br><br><br>Just wordplay, anon. Not doubting his power, but his motivation.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't law just attached an arm to shanks like he did with the brownbeard Pirates and in return shanks would have dealt with doffy?</br>  <br><br>Even if it was just a joke, don't put;<br><br> *TN: ambition means haki. <br><br>Then.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>something that important and powerful must be guarded by someone, which is of course the marine unless nobles got their own army ore powerful than marine that hasn't been shown yet</br>  <br>i don't think shanks cares about his arm</br>  <br><br>Probably the Gorosei sit on it or something.</br></br>  <br>You haven't seen enough of shanks to claim he doesn't use a sword mostly<br>So gtfo<br><br>And he is no longer a rookie it's the new generation and he's been slaying it in the new world for two years</br></br></br></br>  <br> not d√©esse <br>Fuck you Toei.</br></br>  <br><br>i wonder if he'll give Kyros a leg though</br></br>  <br>Nigga you cant even spell sword. A swordsman is literally anyone who knows how to wield one. It's a common job<br><br>Shanks has a fucking Sabre. He used to hava swordfights with MIHAWK. Of course he's a swordsman</br></br></br>  <br>Why indeed?</br>  <br>A Super Rookie is still a Rookie. They arent Yonkou-tier because they've been around for two years<br><br>Especially not Shanks-tier</br></br></br>  What if Buggy actually stuck with Shanks before Roger's crew broke up in Loguetown? He'd probably be extremely strong by now.  SORE GA BOKUTACHI NO HARD KNOCK DAYS  <br>...but he didn't and he isn't.<br>Give it up.<br><br>Don't come at me with any "split into atoms" horseshit either.<br>Buggy is a joke weakling character and always will be.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shichibukai, CP agencies, various random military groups under WG controll all over the world, Pacifistas, Vegapunk, random bounty hunters who could be hired to take out a rebellious Navy and who knows what else that hasn't even been forshadowed yet.<br>I don't think they need an ancient weapon that badly, but it'd certainly would be a nice addition to their military might.</br></br>  <br>I hate this song.</br>  <br>no he wouldn't. He'd be ship pet like he was when they were kids. He's never wanted to get stronger. Buggy has always done cheap shit to get riches instead of fighting for it<br><br>that's just how he is and will always be</br></br></br>  <br>Shanks was a sordmon. Now he is not. Even you mihawk says so.</br>  <br>Shit taste.</br>  <br>It seems that the nobles have authority over the Chiper Pol. In case of the CP0 at least, it been said that they take orders directly under the nobles.</br>  <br>Law here associate mobilizing the CP0 as one of the Celestial Dragons powers.</br>  <br> double mangafox faggotmark </br>  <br>I guess we will see</br>  <br>Not enough watermarks</br>  <br>Dude seriously stop<br><br>Mihawk taking a (verbal) jab at Shanks doesnt mean he isnt still a swordsman</br></br></br>  <br>of course we will. There's no reason to think Kid could stop something like Marineford from happening because he has two more years of adventure under his belt</br>  Kid's alliance is probably aiming to assassinate Shanks and not really have a real fight with him. But I just can't imagine Oda having some filler characters kill one of the most important characters in the series.  <br>how come shanks didnt just haki the shark when it was about to eat luffy?</br>  <br>Do you even Punk Hazard?</br>  <br>The only reason I can think to have this event is for Luffy and co to somehow get wrapped up in it, as it gives an excuse for not only a Luffy/Shanks interaction but Usopp/Yasopp too.<br><br>Which makes it seem like an end of story type event, or close to it.</br></br></br>  <br>He's no filler character I'm sure kid is gonna be a big player from here on out<br><br><br>Not saying he's as strong as shanks but these three pretty strong captains who all survived the new world so far with out being trained by Rayleigh for two years<br><br>I'm sure they are very strong and have a plan, especially with Hawkins there<br><br>Say what you want but it's all speculation, wel see who comes out on top</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That picture showed a filler creature. You refr t canon creatures.<br>I only talked about those specific dragons as filler, not the PH ones.

You autist.</br></br>  <br>That was a fake dragon made by vegapunk u scrub</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>This always reminds me that fucking Toei knew about Luffy's "can hear the voice" ability way before it was revealed to us, readers.</br>  <br> Implying we really know anything at all about shanks and his crew  <br><br>Heh</br></br></br>  <br><br>We know Beckmann is smart as fuck.</br></br>  New bounties when?  <br>Why didn't Gandalf just fly to Mount Doom from the very beginning to destroy the ring instead of entrust the fucking hobbits?</br>  <br>The posts are bait.

He will not raise them yet. Only after they will take down a Yonko.</br>  <br> kuro <br> smart <br><br>Doflamingo is smarter than Kuro</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Strength maybe, but if you're denying Kuro and Nami's intelligence and relating it to the whole East Blue thing that's retarded.</br></br>  <br>Was it East Blue? I thought that SBS was about the smartest characters introduced so far. And wasn't the question asked after they were on the Grand Line?</br>  <br>you are an idiot</br>  <br><br>What because he didn't account for a future 400 Million Bounty landing on the island?</br></br>  <br>That was before Crocodile even introduced. Surely the ranking has changed.</br>  <br>Oda already planned all of his chracters when he wrote this. So this ranking is official, and always will be.</br>  <br>Probably, I'm just saying what I remember.<br>You'd have to find the SBS for full reference.</br></br>  <br> guaranteed replies </br>  <br>No, he specifically said that it's only about characters introduced so far. Vegapunk is obviously on the top.</br>  <br>Sure.</br>  <br>Found it SBS 8<br>D: Who are the "One Piece" characters with the highest and lowest IQ's?! Okay, that's enough for today.<br><br>O: I'll tell you. But when I say "in One Piece". I really mean, "of all the characters introduced in One Piece". And having cleared that up, the character with the highest IQ is Shanks' first mate, Benn Beckman. He is a great crewmate, who possesses astonishing wisdom and strength, and advises Shanks. And right after him would probably be Captain Kuro, then Nami, etc. Now as for the lowest IQ... I can't decide the worst one. They're all idiots. <br><br>You're right. It's probably changed with introduction of new characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br>it's not bait<br><br>the kid's a regular here.

I mean did he even have the guts to fight against Roger? All he's ever done is hide in some safe corner of the world and keep himself out of trouble right? These days some fools may claim Whitebeard's name alone upholds peace on various islands. But as far as I'm concerned he just intimidates the small-fry and believes himself a hero for it.<br><br>Ridiculous! Roger maintained his honor as long as he lived and even dead his fellow pirates hailed him as a king. In other words Whitebeard is an eternal loser who will never surpass Roger! That is all he is.<br><br>Everything I've said is the truth. Now that I think of it he sure is one pitiful man. Making all his underlings call him their "Old Man" or "Father" or whatever and sailing the seas playing house.<br><br>He reigned the seas for decades yet he never became a king or gained anything. He got himself stabbed because one of those foolish "sons" of his believed every word I said and now he'll die to protect that same fool. Truly an empty existence.<br><br>If man does not live righteously he does not deserve to live at all! You rogue pirates don't deserve a "place to belong"!<br><br>Whitebeard will die a loser! A fitting end for a little fish in a big pond!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>then quickly take this</br>  Kizaru is a scary ass motherfucker. I love him.  <br><br>That reminds me, according to Oda, Luffy is a BR</br></br>  <br>What is a BR?</br>  <br>Say that again, m8.</br>  <br>How about this ? You'll have no complaints, right ?<br><br><br>Brazilian ?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Suck a dick, Red Bitch</br>  <br><br>HUE HUE HUE</br></br>  <br><br>Nice.</br></br>  <br>that's a weird looking cumshot but i'll take it</br>  <br>Sanji is the lewdest</br>  This is now a BR thread  <br> Shiki <br><br>WB would be fair more fitting title now that Law is all budy budy with Luffy</br></br></br>  HUEHUEHUEHUE   he became a Shichibukkai by offering 100 pairs of pirate testicles to the Marines   <br>Yea, you'll take it.<br><br><br>He can't be lewd if he doesn't even accept it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hue hue time?<br><br>Post best laughs<br><br> Behehehe </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sanji's inevitable Okama-mode attack during a dire situation when no-one is watching. <br><br>I am ready.</br></br></br>    <br><br>That's why I put; <br><br> even if it was a joke </br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the ugliest OP fanart that i've ever seen.</br>  <br>I've wondered if Sanji will now be able to kick women by imagining them as okama.</br>  <br>FOXY CAN STOP KIZARU HUE HUE<br> \m/ </br></br>  <br><br>Go back to getting palmed off by the Gorosei faggot.</br></br>  <br>When Shanks is showed having tons of allies, a big ass crew, controlling multiple territories and most of his crew being DF users, will people be as disappointed as when WB had one of the most broken powers in the series?</br>  Luffy is the cutest brazilian <br><br>But does that mean Dragon and Garp are also Brazilian?</br></br>  <br> Don't come at me with any "split into atoms" horseshit either. <br> Buggy is a joke weakling character and always will be. <br>Some of you kids here are just way too earnest. You must be a very, boring person.</br></br></br>  <br>Well yes, they are monkeys.</br>  Not coming at this from a tumblrtard angle, but genuine question, what goes through the minds of people at Toei when they decide color schemes? Adult Dofla and Roci look as dark as an African and pale as a ghost respectively, while in the flashbacks the former is lighter and the latter has darker skin. It's not just "well maybe they got a tan" shit either, both of their hair colors change. The lack of consistency is jarring.  <br><br> Okama mode <br> he can kick women <br> won't kick men </br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>nobody is brazilian because One Piece does not take place in the real world</br>  <br>Luffy D. HUEHUEHUE</br>  <br><br>We already know Shanks is broken without seeing any of that though. Dissapointment will be over Storm vs. Weather semantics</br></br>  <br>Is that so<br><br><br>Of course people will be disappointed but they'll be called out to be retards, considering Shanks is a Yonko and Whitebeard was known as the Strongest Man in the World. The fuck did people expect ? An Ant Logia ?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh don't give me that.<br><br>Every time he's mentioned people come up with ways for him to be legit powerful instead of accepting our lord and savior flaws and all.<br>It's annoying.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Plot-twist - It was Roci all along <br> "It was all an act" </br></br></br>    <br>Okay, Luffy is the cutest "would be brazilian if he existed in the real world according to the author"</br>  <br>he's right though</br>  <br> manlet  <br> normal human </br></br>  <br>Toei is the Sweden of animation, trying to appeal to a more diverse audience while also being completely ignorant about it, dunno just what is so wrong with everyone being either european or asian, they force niggers and shitskins in this series way too much.</br>  <br> Shanks <br> manlet <br>Loli are manlet.</br></br></br>  <br>Hair color can change too with the sun, and with age<br><br>Sun can make brown shades more blond, and people who were very fair when they were young can have darker hair shades when they're adults.</br></br></br>  <br> ant logia <br><br>don't summon him</br></br></br>  <br>He meant Coby. Guy is barely Luffy's height.</br>  <br>Ah, my bad.</br>  <br>That scene was one of the few things Toei did right.</br>  <br>Sorry, I don't usually try to bait people but honestly, did people expect some kind of underwhelming fruit ? It was a given that the Strongest guy in the World was going to have something worthy of his title.</br>  <br>They already had a face-to-face match and it didn't go too well for Usopp.<br>But then again he's a sharpshooter, so it would have fitted him better. You're probably right.<br>Luffy just wrecking him effortlessly wasn't much fun.<br><br><br>You're not alone.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of Coby, does anything still have high hopes for him?<br><br>Sure Garp has had nothing to do but pound all his knowledge and training into him, but he still has a long long way to go.</br></br></br>  What does her armpit smell like?  <br>that's assuming Shanks even has a DF which I doubt. Pretty sure Shanks is just that badass</br>  <br>he'll be what Smoker USED to be for Luffy<br><br>..in a decade or so</br></br></br>  <br>The only way I can see him being on par with Luffy is another timeskip (which would also keep Luffy ahead of him) or an unbelievable power increase over the past two years</br>  <br>Yeah, I'm a little worried he'll only achieve relevance after Luffy's time is done.<br>There are people around now who used to know Roger, Coby could be someone in future who used to know Luffy.</br></br>  <br>He'll be what Aokiji was to Garp. A fanboy. And he'll do pretty well for himself, obviously no where near Luffy or Zoro but well enough.<br><br><br>No, I'm not talking about Shanks at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He did fight Usopp. And won.<br>However, it makes zero sense that Usopp didn't try to shoot him with something combustive.</br></br>  <br>I can see him taking over for Sengoku once the government has been toppled, Akainu is dead etc etc<br><br>he'll be the peaceful ruler who keeps his subordinates in line</br></br></br>  <br> unbelievable power increase over the past two years <br>Training won't be enough, or at least it shouldn't be since Luffy has kept getting stronger too.<br><br>Coby needs a zoan to bridge the gap.<br>Somehow people getting fruits long after they're introduced seems unlikely to me and Garp never needed one.<br><br>Still...pink panther would be neato.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone else have a feeling they're going to get a pardon? Doffy knows the horrible secret of the Nobles, after all.  <br>would you?</br>  Kaido revealed in next chapter  <br>The Doffy look-alike from the last chapter will be there, too</br>  <br>Yeah that looks super legit.</br>  <br>Please god, no<br><br><br>Is he wearing someone's pants on his head ?</br></br></br></br>  <br>no. Why do you think they gagged Doffy in the first place?</br>  <br>I hope he'll get a cover story. I don't want him to waste valuable panel time, but I also want to see him get better, not just show up and be awesome all of a sudden.</br>  <br>That actually looks like the kind of antagonist I've been waiting for. Wouldn't mind if it was true.</br>    <br> Why do I have the feeling that Aokiji is either working as a spy for Akainu <br><br>Black Beard would never trust Aokiji to work side by side, hand in hand like Luffy with Law. They're probably working towards the same goal or outcome, but Aokiji has his own motives or twist on what they want to accomplish, count on it fucking kiddo. Aokiji wouldn't go full EDGE or ANGST just because he didn't get what he wanted. Shit writing like that is reserved for shit manga, like Naburoto or Bleach.</br></br></br>  <br> Doffy look-alike <br>I'm seeing crazy man Carl instead.</br></br>  So who is going to be the new crew member?  <br>Buggy Doujinshi<br> he removes his asshole <br> passes it to somone who he wants to be banged by <br> he leaves <br> that person pounds away at his asshole <br> Buggy removes his dick <br> flies it back to that person <br> surprise buttrapes him midair while that person is fucking his removed asshole as a pocket   boi pussy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lmao this is a fucking blueno edit</br>  <br>Doffy can't blackmail people if he's in prison or dead</br>  <br><br>There isn't going to be a new nakama. Please stop with this. Robin, Brook and Sanji already have next to no importance and Oda has to break up the crew just to work them into the plot of some relevance.</br></br>  <br>You wish. There isn't a single Blueno panel that looks like that.</br>  <br>It's Hajrudin.</br>  <br>He is gonna do it anyway. He knows he is a hack but he will do what the fans want.</br>  <br>i'd be lying if I said I never thought up that exact scenario<br><br>A shame no artists ever take advantage of Buggy's power</br></br></br>  <br>keep telling yourself that</br>  <br> he will do what the fans want. <br>Why do people even want more crewmates? Oda already showed that characters don't need to join to appear a lot, like Law.</br></br>  <br>we already know who's joining</br>  <br>judging by that glimpse we got of him in that one color spread this could really be legit</br>  <br><br> tfw no boa doujins of her growing 60 vaginas/mouths on a wall and letting villagers go to town </br></br>  <br><br> boa <br><br>You mean Robin.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Contact a Fujoshit artist then. Maybe he'll find it appealing enough to do it.</br>  <br><br>Yeah my bad, I was thinking with my dick and it defaulted to Boa.</br></br>  <br>Akainu. Or Teach.</br>    <br>For the last time,it was a tower</br>  <br>Jinbe is perfect for a new nakama. He has ties with Luffy from before the timeskip, he was accepted by the crew in FI, saved Luffy, had a flashback, he fits a role in the crew, can save the people who have eater DFs, has an original fighting style. and fits the way the crew is full of weird people.</br>  <br> Fujoshi <br> He <br><br>I believe Fudanshi is the word you want. Men generally dont draw yaoi though</br></br></br></br>  <br>He means the color spread with other Yonko.</br>  <br>Has that doujin happened yet? I'd love to exanime that.<br><br><br>Speaking of Robin, I find it odd how she even bothers to pick up or hold anthing with her original arms. I'd be growing those niggers for everything.</br></br></br></br>  <br>there's also a giant fishtank on the ship so he has a comfy place to sleep</br>  <br>are you retarded or did you just miss the color spread that showed a glimpse of Kaido</br>  So we're all in agreement than, below Luffy, Zoro is the best Strawhat, right?  <br><br>what is this sepia bullshit</br></br>  <br>Thanks for the correction, I hope you understood what I meant though.</br>  <br><br>if this is not legit then kudos to the artist, that looks a 100% like Odas art</br></br>  <br>yes of course!<br><br>i'd likely have to pay them though. Do I want it that badly?</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit Zoro's a berserker.</br>  <br><br>If this is real than I guess the theory that 800 would be the Kaido reveal was wrong. I wonder what Oda has in store for 800.</br></br>  <br>They're just edit from Oda's drawings.</br>  <br>if only zoro used 1 sword instead of 3 so it wouldnt be a cartoon for 12y olds</br>  <br>Scans of the magazine's paper pages. Uncleaned.</br>  <br>why are you even here, seriously</br>  <br>For me, first spot is tied between Luffy/Zoro/Usopp. I can't love one of them more than the other.</br>  <br>Please be real. I want Kaido to look like that real bad.</br>  <br>Kickstarter perhaps? Or is that even legal for such a purpose? It's copyrighted material after all, and the artist would be monetizing it.</br>    <br>He's a  Magical  Beast.</br>   Toei not showing Law hiding among the corpses <br>fucking pussys</br>  <br>That idiot forgot to remove his glasses too.</br>  <br>No way. He's a Saber or Assassin.</br>  <br>nah, looks nothing alike</br>  <br> genderswap the SH <br> make Robin a simple she-beast <br><br>why</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think that's just shadowing Anon.</br>  <br>Sure.</br>  <br> yfw the fight doesn't even get shown </br>  <br>no, it really does not</br>  <br>Keep baiting, my friend!</br>  <br>who is hajrudin</br>  <br>Ok this actually looks legit, but there is no chapter this week, how this got leaked?</br>  <br>next movie when</br>  <br>Suuure?</br>  <br> in a spread where all yonko are shown <br> Hajrudin out of nowhere <br>sure son, sure</br></br></br>  <br>Enough with this "no chapter this week" meme.</br>  <br>There is a chapter this week, next week is break week</br>  <br>I'm not saying that's Kaido, you dingus. I'm saying they don't look like glasses.</br>  Is the colored version of One Piece official stuff or is it fanmade?  <br>It's not a meme newfriend, oda gets a break after 4 chapters every month.</br>  Nyaa should ban all [AnimeRG] releases from now on. They are a fucking embarrasment for their site.  <br>yeah, and we are at 3 chapters</br>  <br>Well there's no break next week</br>  <br>I like Brook and Franky more than Zoro. I preferred the way he was before time skip.</br>  <br>It's Deviantart made.</br>  <br>And we always get an announcement when it happens. Did you happen to see "One Piece will be on a break next week" in the last chapter?</br>  <br>even if you accept all the other crap I imagine everyone just thinks "well his teeth are about to fly off" when they see zoro fight</br>  <br>They're released by Shueisha.</br>  <br>No it indeed is 4, but the last break was after 5 consecutive chapters as well</br>  Anon.  <br>Because of his looks ?

Why, you ask? It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs special to me. <br> As soon as I placed the can on the table, the three of them focused their stares on me. <br> Um, what‚Äôs with those skeptical looks‚Ä¶? There isn‚Äôt a person in Chiba who‚Äôd get upset from receiving this as a sweet. At least, that‚Äôs what I wanted to say, but everyone‚Äôs faces looked considerably doubtful‚Ä¶ <br> Yuigahama stared at the can and whispered. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I bet even I can make that.‚Äù <br> ‚ÄúLike hell you can. Quit screwing around and stop looking down on MAX COFFEE. If you‚Äôre thinking you can just dump condensed milk and sugar into coffee, you‚Äôre quite mistaken. No, seriously, don‚Äôt even bother.‚Äù <br> ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs actually angry at that!?‚Äù <br> Obviously. It‚Äôs a completely different beast from just putting condensed milk in coffee. In fact, putting coffee in condensed milk would be more convincing to me. You couldn‚Äôt achieve that sticky sweetness through normal means. It wasn‚Äôt something amateurs should stick their heads into. <br> Isshiki placed the tip of her finger on her lips to think and opened her mouth. <br> ‚ÄúActually, that would put me over my budget.‚Äù <br> ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know exactly how much you plan on making, but you‚Äôre under a rather severe budget if you‚Äôre limiting yourself to less than 130 yen a piece‚Ä¶‚Äù Yukinoshita said in disbelief, rubbing her temple. That, however, wasn‚Äôt a concern. <br> ‚ÄúNo problem. MAX COFFEE is cheaper if you pick the right store and buy it in bulk.‚Äù <br> ‚ÄúJeez Hikki, just how into it are you‚Ä¶?‚Äù <br><br>It's hard to believe Watari isn't getting paid with this ammount of shilling.<br> https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-11/chapter-1/</wbr> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hayato x Hachi OTP    Iroha poorfag  <br>The true genuine.</br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!

It was also the first anime i downloaded on the internet.<br>I remember googling 'best anime of 2007' to see if claymore was on the list because i felt it was THAT good and wanted validation from it as well. I liked it much more than death note.

It's a one time thing and it is for life. I liked a lot of anime girls since I started watching the shit in the 90's, but didn't end up with an actual waifu until 5 or 6 years ago. You're probably misusing the term. A better thread would be "first member of your harem" or something.  <br>Well at least you had good taste from the start.</br>  This one.<br>And still.</br>    <br>I'll assume you're actually asking about our first infatuation with 2D instead.</br>  Probably Kari from Digimon 01<br><br>Hmm... that could explain a lot of things although I was younger when 01 was aired.

If it wasn't Asuka, Misty, or Sakura, you don't know shit about anime.  op has more than one waifu.    <br>He probably divorced her or something and found a new one. It'e natural though, humans do fall in love with different people trough out their lives.</br>  <br> More than 1 waifu <br>I don't think you know how to count anon, Waifuism is a binary concept.</br></br>    <br>Not with waifus.

I remember my mother telling me "anon, is that green haired cutie your girlfriend?". I blushed so hard that it hurt.   <br>I'm pretty sure they're all normalfag tryhards that would dump their waifu for the first 3DPD that showed them any affection.</br>  <br>Eternal good taste.</br>  <br>Admittedly I hated her because Rei was my husbando...</br>  <br> implying I remember all my waifus </br>  <br>That was cute</br>    Never had one cause I'm not an autist.    <br>I had a serious crush on her, still do.<br><br>She was also my first 2d fap, I kinda remember the image, but was never able to find it.</br></br></br>  and she still is    After eight years of anime, she finally made me understand why people have waifus.  Was madly in love, but after rebellion she wasn't the same girl as before. Lost complete interest.  <br>Sasami</br>  She's forever alone, though. The person she loves will never reciprocate in the way she wants.  You didn't get a lot of choices in the 80s... but I thought she was cute.

Post their picture and state what work and reason.  <br>Define hack.</br>  Post 80's Tomino.  <br>A hack used to describe an overworked, worn-out, horse. Now it describes a director or writer, overrated, who churns out anything in the hope he will be paid for it, or anyone else who doesn't do his job properly or professionally.</br>  Nisio Isin<br>Urobuchi Gen<br><br>I shouldn't have to explain either.</br></br></br>  Nobuyuki Fukumoto<br>Inio Asano</br>  Togashi  Toriyama  <br>Nice bait.</br>  <br> bait <br><br>No. <br><br><br>Came here to post these.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hirohiko Araki  <br>It's not bait.<br><br>What, you actually like these shitty writers?</br></br></br>  Jukki Hanada  Kobayashi Ritz  Tezuka  <br>Nisio, no<br>Urobuchi, yes</br></br>  /a/ will not be able to agree on this list at all. <br><br>Aside from Anno.</br></br>  <br><br>OP<br><br><br>I think we can all agree on this one at least.</br></br></br></br></br>  Imagawa <br>Akira Ishida<br>Michiko Yokote<br>Yoshikazu Yasuhiko<br>Kazuhiko Shimamoto<br>Kaoru Mori<br>Tomino<br>Gen Urobuchi<br>Nisio<br>Nasu</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Without a doubt, OP.</br>  Your favorite person in the anime industry  Whoever made your favorite series.  <br> Kaoru Mori <br>what</br></br>  moot  <br>Kishi and Kubo</br>  <br>who?</br>  <br>Oda and his bullshit One Piece series has to be at the top of that list. The MC is borderline retarded, the art is so cartoony that you barely even think of it as anime when you read. But whatever anime doesn't have a rule book in that regard so it's ok. Writing throughout it is shit, shit pacing, horrid character designs, devil fruits are to One Piece as Dragon Balls are to DragonBall Z franchise. Just, ugh, I still have no idea why Japan likes this shit, they must be mentally ill as well. It isn't the world pushing this to be so popular contrary to popular belief. It's fucking Japan and only Japan. Fuck Oda, this bastard ass hack. <br><br>Overrated, Unworked, Lazy, shit-tier 1997 manga artist that should have ended his career before 2004.</br></br></br>  <br> Imagawa <br>kill urself my man</br></br>  I'm surprised nobody mentioned Takahashi yet in an effort to start shit.<br> Of course they didn't, DAGURAMU is perfection </br>  <br>Nigga Fukumoto is a god. His manga are much more different and superior to the the rest of the shitty formulaic LN trash released nowadays.</br>  <br> replying seriously in this type of thread <br> nowdays <br>Stop being a nostalgia fag</br></br></br>  <br>Kubo is a bigger hack. Even Japan knows its true.</br>  <br>Relevant for kubo</br>  <br>That's not fair, he has proper backgrounds by pouring ink over it now</br>  <br>Hiroyuki Sawano</br>  <br><br>His nonbackgrounds are the least offensive thing about bleach</br></br>  The guy that wrote Kaiji. such overrated filth  <br>Tite Kubo</br>  <br> tfw retard posts a /v/ thread near me </br>  Gen<br>Fukumoto<br>Hideki anno<br>Miyazaki recently<br>Imaishi</br></br></br></br>  <br>Btw does Kubo live in an ink factory or something, like this is suppose to be bleach's "colour" page.</br>  Wataru Watari  <br>JESUS FUCKING CHRIST, KUBOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!<br><br>WHY ISN'T HE FIRED?!</br></br></br>  <br>His volume sells, despite the the weekly jump rankings being piss poor, because Bleach still have a relatively large fanbase compared to newer series.</br>  <br>I don't know why you retards keep circlejerking over Miura's background art. He isn't the be-all end-all of detailed manga artists.</br>  <br>Doesn't matter, because the point was that Kubo is shit.</br>  Nasu  <br>Hacks: All the writers you like.<br>Not: All the writers I like.</br></br>  Anno   Ctrl+F <br> No Shinbo <br><br>Great, only children are on.</br></br></br>  <br>Kubo draws on black paper, that's common knowledge.</br>  Satoshi Kon<br>Hayao Miyazaki<br>Junichi Sato<br>Kunihiko Ikuhara</br></br></br>  <br> Miyazaki recently <br>Ah, no. The Wind Rises is the best thing he has ever done.</br></br>  <br>You can't be a hack if you do fucking nothing.</br>  Nasu<br>Oda<br>Kawahara</br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>Pretty much everyone in anime and manga industry is a hack. People that can produce decent things work for the normalfag audience, which is much larger market, than Chinese porno cartoons.</br>  Takahashi, only good thing he did is VOTOMS.  <br> Urobuchi <br> shitty <br>Name one genuinely shitty work of his other than that one CGI movie.</br></br></br>  <br> I am borderline retarded, the art is so cartoony that you barely even think of it as anime when you read </br>  <br>This is about hacks; people who just do the same shit over and over. Not necessarily bad, but brainless.<br><br>Like Jun Maeda.<br><br>On that note, I think Fate/Zero is shitty.</br></br></br></br></br>   No Yamakan <br><br>For shame /a/</br></br>  <br>Oh come on, Jun Maeda does the same thing over and over again: harems with sad girls.<br><br>But Urobuchi is pretty much the opposite of one-note. Psycho-Pass (dystopia/cop drama), Phantom (thriller/romance), Fate/Zero (Fate), Saya no Uta (drama/romance), Kamen Rider Gaim (sentai), Madoka (magical girl).<br><br>I wouldn't exactly count Gargantia and Aldnoah as his, but those three episodes he wrote from either: SF and mecha.<br><br>What more variety do you want? Comedy/SoL? Gaim has plenty of comedy episodes and some authors just can't do SoL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yuasa, because pretentious.  <br> Post their picture and state what work and reason. <br> reason <br> Thread is namedropping anyone worth remembering in the industry <br><br>This is really embarrassing. At least try to state reasons, /a/nons.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The whole cast of Chaos Dragon</br>   No one here has said Shinichiro Watanabe yet   Every writer and director I don't like.<br>Every writer and director you like.</br>  Takahiro  <br>But they're all the same thing anon. <br>Every single one of them is Phantom with a twist put on it. Psycho Pass is Phantom but in a dystopia. Zero is Phantom in a fantasy theme. Etc. The plot stays the same while the setting changes.</br></br>  <br>His VNs are also very varied. A comedy spaghetti western starring 3 sluts in space, revenge and wuxia story set in futuristic shanghai, vampire kamen rider, lovecraft inspired love story and even an equilibrium fanfiction. <br><br>For LNs there is Black lagoon spinoffs, airplanes racing dragons and dark fantasy story inspired by fighting fantasy and warhammer.</br></br></br>  Shoji Kawamori<br>/m/ agrees</br>  Fukuda<br><br>I don't think it needs explaining. He's complete garbage.</br></br>  <br>Kubo<br>Okada<br>Yamakan<br>Anno<br>Shinbo<br>Urobutcher<br>Nasu<br>Nisio<br>R07</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mari Okada</br>  <br>He's singlehandedly saving Sunrise from the hack Tomino.</br>  <br> R07 <br>No.</br></br>  <br>How that man even gets employment is beyond me.</br>  <br>I can respect a man that gets a bikini wax while traveling.</br>  <br>Madoka is not a magical girl, gen himself said he never watched a magical girl show, it has literally zero common elements if we don't count the mascot and the transformation</br>  <br> the plot stays the same <br>Have you even watched these series?<br><br>Or do you think everything that's not a SoL, harem or a comedy is 'the same'?<br><br><br>I really need to look into these VNs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh please. I've never seen Phantom, but Psycho-Pass and Fate/Zero have almost nothing in common plot-wise other than a dark atmosphere.</br>  <br> has a girl who fights with magic in a frilly skirt <br> not a magical girl <br>Sure brah</br></br></br>  <br>Okada is okay when she's not trying to write intelligent characters.</br>  <br>Indeed. Its like saying that a show about construction workers is a mecha because it has machines in it</br>  <br> title is "Magical Girl Madoka Magica" <br> literally every main character is a magical girl <br> "It doesn't have anything in common with magical girl shows if we ignore everything it has in common with magical girl shows guys!" </br></br></br>  <br> Madoka is not a magical girl <br><br>It is.<br><br> gen himself said he never watched a magical girl show <br><br>[citation needed]<br><br> it has literally zero common elements if we don't count the mascot and the transformation <br><br>And, you know, magical girls. Given power by a mascot to fight for that mascot's cause. And the whole message of friendship, family and belief in human spirit saving the world. Literally the only thing you need to make PMMM into the next Precure season is toning down the number of deaths and brightening overall aesthetics.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What are you talking about, a show about people fighting in big robots is always a mecha.</br>  <br> Yamakan <br>Yamakan is saving anime, you fuck. Didn't you watch the masterpiece that is Wake-Up Girls?</br></br>  <br>Urobuchi does the same shit in every show he has: muh darkness, muh cynicism, muh idealism is wrooooong<br><br>The guy straight out admitted he hates idealistic characters and happy things. No matter what he does, all his stories, regardless of genre, are about shitting on the things he believes are wrong. Hell, Madoka, Psycho-Pass, Fate/Zero, all these are about the same thing: urobuchi screaming about how everything is shit and anyone that thinks otherwise is delusional and naive, and using his characters as devices to illustrate this mindset.<br><br>Yeah, I got the message, Urobuchi, the world is a cruel place and anyone that even DREAMS of making good things should be crushed to their very core for being a delusional child. Because obviously cynicism makes you a mature person. Really, man, really?<br><br>He doesn't even make the whole suffering in his stories to make a point or make a comment about an interesting topic. He just likes to shit on things he doesn't like for the hell of it. Once you know this is really had to take his stories seriously when you know is just him looking down to anyone that doesn't agree with his mindset.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally the only thing missing from being a standard mahou shoujo is a Prince character, but those have already been dropped when the genre moved to target neckbeards.</br>  <br> muh darkness, muh cynicism, muh idealism is wrooooong <br> call the police, author has common themes in his works </br></br>  <br> talking about animes you didn't watch: the post </br>  <br>What?<br>Silver link makes different types of anime.</br></br>  <br>Idealism won in Gaim and Gargantia (he wrote the conclusion, so it counts).<br><br>It won in Madoka, if you don't count the movies.<br><br>It lost in Fate/Zero and Phantom.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Seems to me that you're just projecting. You probably think that he likes utilitarianism, right?</br>  <br>  author has common themes in his works <br>I never said that was wrong. Is just that the "themes" Urobuchi usually uses are childish.<br>  cynicism is mature <br>  idealism is wrong <br>  everything is shit and anyone that thinks otherwise is delusional and naive <br>That's literally the main theme for 90% of the things he does.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It won in Madoka <br>It wasn't supposed to in the beginning.<br>Madoka's original ending was supposed to be depressing, but they changed it to a more optimistic tone because of the earthquake, Urobuchi didn't want that but had to roll with it.</br></br></br>  <br> cynicism vs idealism is childish <br>Wasn't 4chan 18+?</br></br>  <br> He just likes to shit on things he doesn't like for the hell of it <br>Kinda like you're doing? It's called a theme, so one author/director likes his darkness, big fucking whoop, watch someone else.</br></br>  <br> It won in Madoka, if you don't count the movies. <br><br>The Rebellion was made to set up another TV season, so it practically had to have a bad or ambigious ending. Though I still think the way it approached setting up a new conflict sucked royally.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, I don't think he gives a fuck about it. Have you actually read any of his interviews? He admitted the only reason he shits on characters like Saber or Sayaka is because he hates characters that fight for justice and shit. Which kind of explain why Saber exists to be shit on in Fate/Zero and why Sayaka gets the same treatment in Madoka.</br>  <br> That's literally the main theme for 90% of the things he does <br>Akane defies Sybil by retaining her desire to improve society in spite of its flaws.<br>Madoka overcomes entropy by becoming a benevolent god and saving the magical girls of the world, past and present.<br>Ledo (Red?) casts his cynicism aside to party with squid and belly dancing island bitches.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cynical and idealistic characters get shafted in his works. You're just terrible at understanding those "childish" themes.</br>  <br>Except it was never cynicism vs idealism.<br>Is literally cynicism &gt; idealism<br>To be cynicism vs idealism it'd have to actually give a chance for idealism to have a point, in urobuchi's case is just idealism being for dumb kids and cynicism for cool adults</br></br></br>   the anime finally had the balls to make the female companion in love with Ash <br><br>Why is Serena so perfect?</br></br>  <br><br><br>you have your own board, take your manchild garbage and fuck off.</br></br></br>  Didn't Misty had a crush on Ash? I remember her getting jealous once or twice.  <br> said the /a/non <br><br><br>What happened?</br></br></br></br>  HE'S GOING TO BLOW HIS LOAD DEEP INSIDE OF THAT LITTLE CUNNY<br><br>YAAAAHHHHHH!!!</br></br>  Serena a shit. Misty x Ash OTP.  How much semen does Ash have built up just waiting to explode?  <br>She moved on a long time ago. Probably getting the black dick from Brock by now.</br>   Ash acts as a mentor to the current cast <br><br>Unless a character shows up that's specifically teaching the cast something, Ash is doing it more often than not. Or unless Citron is showing his expertise. It feels weird.</br></br>  <br>About 15 years worth at this point.<br><br>The first time he lets loose, it'll be a one man bukkake</br></br></br>  <br> What happened? <br>Female companion actively wants to fuck Ash (has stated so, everybody except Ash knows it). It's one-sided, but it's actual romantic development.</br></br>   Satoshi <br>Wat</br>  <br>Did you really think his name was Ash in Japan?<br>Misty and Brock are original too.</br></br>  <br><br>Would have cool if they had him cooking for the group too, but I guess you have to save some development for future seasons. <br><br>Would have been a cool nod to Brock teaching him</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying Ash ever bothered to learn <br>He would be eating berries all day if it weren't for Brock/Cilan/Citron.</br></br>  <br>Nah, she's banging Tracey now.</br>  <br>Brock didn't teach Ash shit.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure he'd bang her sister before her.</br>  <br>I didn't say he didn't. Misty's just his current fuck mate.</br>  Pokemon does the typical "girl likes oblivious MC" that countless generic shounen usually do, and /vp/ acts like it's somehow groundbreaking. There's just something pitiful about them.  <br>The thing is, Pokemon isn't even a shounen, and it's never done it before, so yeah, it's understandable their hype.</br>  <br>Pokemon is most definitely directed primarily at very young boys.</br>  <br>It's aimed at an age right younger than shonen.</br>  So after all these seasons, is Ash actually older than 10 now?  <br>No</br>  <br>No</br>  MFW I realize that Ash should technically be older than me  <br>It's the RahXephon effect.</br>  Can we finally have Ash marrying Serena<br>So that we can have a new MC i think its time Nintendo</br>  <br>hey u no nuffin brock taught ash how to cook and how not to approach women</br>  <br> Serena <br>She's crazy endearing.</br></br>   Misty will never return to being the OTP with Ash.  <br><br>Fuck this gay show</br></br>  And then some bullshit situation will force them to go their separate ways and Ash will meet a new companion  <br> Misty will never return to being the OTP with Ash <br>Good.</br></br>      <br>Misty a shit.</br>  <br>maybe it's just nostalgia but goddamn it should've been misty x ash</br>  <br>Shounen is aimed at elementary schoolers and up. Kids younger than that usually can't even read.</br>  <br>Fuck are you talking about?<br>Pokemon is pretty much Kodomo mostly and is sometimes shounen.<br>It airs after Aikatsu and before Naruto. But it's definitely closer to Aikatsu than it is to Naruto.</br></br></br>  <br> pokemon audience <br> can't even read <br><br>sounds about right.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Give them a break.<br>They wait for more than a decade for this kind of development.</br></br>  <br>Clemont doesn't know anything.</br>  <br>There's a reason Eureka has to get all the ladies for him.</br>  <br> everybody except Ash knows it <br>There is no hope.</br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>I'm with you man but that boat has sailed. At least there's a chance now. Hey maybe Ash will even win the league in this regio-AHAHAHAHAHA</br>  <br> it should've been misty x ash <br>Tsunderefags.</br></br>  <br>There won't be new MC in Pokemon unless they give Pikachu to some other trainer. Because the reason they keep Ash is Pikachu, who is THE mascot character of this franchise and they must keep it.</br>  <br>Sky Suit Serena is a miracle of the universe.</br>  <br>/vp/'s been destroyed by shitposters lately, retard.</br>  <br><br>Sorry, but this is obvious bait.</br></br>      <br>Wasn't that ship just pushed in the filler?</br>  <br>It's not bait, it's unfulfilled childhood fantasies.</br>  <br>which episode was that?</br>  <br>That pic is an edit. However, if you are asking about the episode where she wears that, it's XY036.</br>   balls <br><br>I call it lack of ideas, its not going anywhere and only used to sell more toys</br></br>    <br> 38 votes <br>Woah I see /vp/ is bursting with activity</br></br>  <br><br>Boobie monster trainer is up there</br></br>  <br>It's just bait to get watchers.<br><br>their relationship is generic as they get.<br><br>but in an anime empty of romance like pokemon the slightest hint of it can create a shitstorm and stir up its dull fanbase.<br><br><br> rosa <br> 2nd  <br>I call bullshit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>stop posting this shit survey<br><br>fucking Mayfags</br></br></br>  <br>Rosa is extremely popular on /vp/</br>  <br>that's why I don't believe she isn't 1</br>  <br><br>Lewd</br></br>  She does look fe,m,ale. Therefore she is f,e,m,ale.<br><br>Those antennae alone are an excuse for her to be f,e,male only. She's just so m,otherly, and everyone hates the m,ale ones. In reality, the "ma,le" ones are just f,e,m,ale ones confused about their gender. It kinda makes sense because she's half slug, but then it doesn't make sense because she's the most fe,minine mon.<br><br>You too can make a change. Get one of the "m,ale" ones, and powersaves their gender if talking to them through the microphone won't work. That m,ale symbol will disappear!<br><br>Since when have you ever seen someone refer to her as a "he" or a "him"? Have you ever seen someone say "I love my m.ale G.oodra!"?

There is no chance of any development between them, as it would come out of nowhere.  <br>Not when she's getting drilled everyday <br><br><br>He looks VERY 10 to me</br></br></br></br>  <br>The second movie clearly hinted at it, and no it's not just the dub.</br>  <br><br>Misty, Oh Misty!<br><br>How doth I expressed my love for thee?<br><br>Are thou the morning dew,<br>reflecting of the sparkly mew?<br><br>Are thou the wind in the trees,<br>skirting gently around the leaves,<br>in a midsummer's eve?<br><br>Are thou the blood of the earth,<br>blessed in womb, taking mine girth,<br>fully,<br><br>I want to fuck you hard, you whore bully,<br><br>forever yours,<br>thy secret love,<br>my waifu will never know.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Serena will be getting drilled by Clemont or the fat ass once Ash leaves her broken hearted in Kalos.</br>  <br> Ash looks for Tracy <br> Misty gets mentioned <br> Ash is disappointed he missed seeing Tracy again <br><br>Nostalgiafags on suicide watch</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0dJ<wbr>XCNVA_vE</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Ayy care to share that shit you're smoking?</br>  why is Serena so cute?  <br>It's actually a plausible ship.</br>  <br>10/10, true poet</br>  Just issuing a timely reminder that this is the best poke doujin.  <br>I haven't watched pokemon since 3rd gen and I dont see any thing going on with misty and ash when I watched gen 1. I'm glad they gave him a girl this time though</br>  <br>Reality, an anime like pokemon will never get a romantic resolution. simple as that sooner or later Ash will screw up or Serena will realize he is a lost cause when it comes to her affection and will move on. <br><br>Its delirious to believe that they would actually make something out of this ship. It is clearly only otaku bait and bringing in the themes of affection also found in the games.</br></br></br>  <br>But masuda and the execs are into it though, it's almost canon and very popular already there in Japan</br>  <br> this new <br>Already confirmed that the staff are pro-ship.</br></br>  <br> Junichi Masuda <br> Like!RT </br></br>  <br>You think the shipping input is coming from the fanbase like misty x ash. <br><br>Well you are clearly wrong. The fucking staff are into it, even masuda.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Rek rival's shit <br> Get cash <br> Fame <br> Cute girls everywhere <br>This is why I have always wanted to be in the Pokemon world.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why are /vp/ such faggots?</br></br>  <br> image <br>Why are pokegirls so lewd?</br></br>  <br>This too</br>    <br><br>Both Wrong</br></br>  <br>CHECK THOSE DIGITS<br><br><br>YOU FUCKING MISSED IT BY 2</br></br></br></br>  <br>they are just promoting another of their products<br><br><br><br>of course not. but actually believing anything will come from its delirious. I even said the reason why shipping was added in was to bait viewers in. Hell isn't one of the upcoming episodes being promoted with a screenshot of Ash holding Serena? exactly. the producers are trying to get people to watch and they will get you to watch it. kids will buy their merchandise, fans will watch the movie, get the pokemon distributions. at the end of the day pokemon has proven time after time that must continue without an actual resolution. <br><br>So enjoy whatever its on this season's menu because then she will just appear in a desolate episode next series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Ahahahahha so is it canon now?</br></br></br>  Is it thursday yet?  <br>A palindrome number is impressive in itself surely</br>  <br><br>Ash is out, Tracy is the only guy in Kanto who can heal Misty's broken heart</br></br>  <br>it was the best for a very long time, I admit.</br>  <br>Well it's their last gamble after last season, BW failed horribly and put the franchise into a miserable position. If not for XY antics they would've probably gone down now. But I do believe they wont continue the anime a little longer and would follow other anime as well and do a reboot with fresh characters in gen 7. Also anime is approaching 20 years</br>  <br><br>They just want a "battle"</br></br>  <br>It would be hilarious if Serena actually ends up being the Brock after XY, and ends up tagging along for future seasons. <br><br>XY has already shaken up the formula quite a bit (granted most of it was as an apology for BW), so it would be that unexpected for them to change the previous, and I quote "boys need a new piece of eye candy to look at every once in a while", policy.</br></br></br>  <br>She looks so good with that haircut. Never has there been a haircut in anime that looked as good as this</br>  <br> wouldn't <br>Typos, sorry about that. Also, in case anybody is wondering, that quote is apparently from Masamitsu Hidaka, the storyboard artist, and the director up til battle frontier if I recall correctly.</br></br>  <br>Considering they made an effort to change Serena, giving her a different vibe from her game counterpart. Also XY broke many status quos already</br>  <br> Iris being adorable <br><br>Rare. Appreciated but extremely rare.</br></br></br>  <br>Also, looks like no one in /a/ noticed Ash's new hairstyle</br>  <br><br>He had a hairstyle?</br></br>  <br>How so?</br>  <br>Gamefreak are masters of creating innocent looking girls that are entirely acceptable for young kids but giving them lewd edges that makes them fappable as all fuck.</br>  <br>Nah dont listen to that fool, /vp/'s back to its current form now they started leaking about the next game. Before that though /vp/ was on a dryspell with no new games announced and it was horrible.</br>  <br>Why is Viola the best gym leader waifu?</br>  Go back to /vp/ and take your endless shipping threads with you.  <br>Thats not Flannery or Gardenia</br>  <br>Chateau viola best viola<br><br><br>I can't deny this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Those fucking poses.</br>  <br>Just wait until Ash gets a Mega stone in a bracelet or something. I'm looking forward to how dramatic they are going to make his posing when that happens.</br>  <br><br> Armpits <br> Boobs <br>I like where this is going</br></br></br></br>  <br>Obligitory</br>  <br><br> Little girl </br></br>  <br>Not even close, Korrina is the best female gym leader and also the best XY girl at the moment.<br><br>She is far from perfect, with short hair like this I want her off the show as soon a possible so a long hair Pokegirl can take her place.</br></br></br>  You guys know any pixiv artist that make good pokehentai  <br><br>Her body is super lewd</br></br>  <br>she is in love  with dick </br>  <br>Back to /padt/, shitposter</br>  We can all agree that May has the biggest boobs of all pokegrills in the anime, right?<br><br> not including Lorelei </br></br>  <br>When did pokemon become jojo?</br>  remember when Serena was cute?  <br/>  <br>I think he will have it on his glove.</br>  <br><br/></br>  look how cute she used to be<br><br>she was so much happier back then ;_;</br></br>  <br>Not sure. Meowth did a DIO pose on a roadroller then</br>  <br> ;_; <br>Fuck off idiot.</br></br>    <br>Too bad she's flat as an ironing board.</br>  <br>Being more cute is something subjective, but she was way more feminine back then that's for sure.</br>  best doujin  Those legs  <br>cuteness isn't even subjective if she looks like every other short hair dyke. her puffy hair was unique.</br>  <br>There's also this. Fuck korea while we are at it.</br>      This is now a Hulk Hogan thread.  <br>This between Serena and Delia when?</br>  <br>Again, fuck off back to /pol/</br>   /vp/ accepts and allows the death of this in exchange of a dyke   Fuck off, amourshippers.  <br>O T P</br>  <br>I know something else that needs to die</br>  <br>Those legs are nice but unfortunately she has short hair.<br><br>Her face is still cute but when I see that short dyke hair my /pol/ powerlevel goes off the chart.</br></br></br>  <br>Has Serena admitted she wants Ash yet?</br>   Implying they won't just dump her off when this season ends   <br>You mean this?</br>  Do any of the remaining gymleaders have a mega? Or someone in the e4?  is this how the anime thread ranks serena?   Pokemom   So how many of you want to fuck Serena? No lies please.  What would his mega of choice be?  <br>no its how one autist does</br>   people in /vp/ allow dyke hair serena only because of their shipping garbage <br> i-if she is oc donut steal they won't replace her! <br> implying shipping isn't anything else but a way to let you know the girl is straight and a fine waifu </br></br>  <br>The Elite 4 has megas in the anime, even when they didn't in the game (see the 1st mega evolution special).</br>  <br>Redundant question. Ask something better.</br>  <br>Nope, Serena is still beta. Though you could say it was implied in XY80.</br>  <br>So Ash's mega arc after the 8th badge?</br>  <br><br>it's charizard y for the inevitable battle against this edgelord</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br> being this anal about a hairstyle change <br>Here's your reply</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>please go back to /vp/ your dyke hair isn't welcomed here</br>  <br><br>Serena is probably one of the most fashionable pokegirls ever</br></br>  <br> the anime finally had the balls to make the female companion in love with Ash <br><br><br>It's all moot and useless if Ash doesn't notice and does shit about it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, it'll be Charizard Z or Mega Greninja. Zygard got a new form teased at the end of the new movie, so we're getting Pokemon Z, or XZ and YZ revealed soon. They'll likely add new Megas there again.</br>  <br>So sad...<br>This ship was born dead</br></br>  Korrina when?  <br>WHATCHA GONNA DO LONGHAIRFAG WHEN HOMOMANIA RUNS WILD ON YOU BROTHER?</br>  <br> 2015 <br><br> Still doesn't know his original name </br></br></br>  <br> dyke <br> thinks that word actually means anything in this context <br> thinks randomly searching up a word in the dictionary that means lesbian will rile people up <br>Here's your reply.</br></br></br></br>  Serena is so fucking hot guys...  <br>Wrong one. This is the real list.</br>  <br>sorry I don't watch wrestling</br>  <br> Though you could say it was implied in XY80. <br><br>Explain</br></br></br>  <br><br>She is never going to have another reappearance</br></br>  <br><br>Why did she start wearing a makes-me-look-fat dress?</br></br>  <br>Not yet but Ash is starting to gain senses</br>  <br>Cancer pls leave.</br>  <br>Please come back to the /vp/ padt thread, we miss you. You were so much better than the shitposters we have now.</br>  <br> implying she won't be in actIV </br>  <br>There is no filler in this series. It's all original.<br><br>Well, depending of the point of view, tge whole anime series is a one big ass filler show Since is based on the games.</br></br></br>  <br> that light in his eyes after looking at Serena <br>This is basically it now, is he slowly losing his obliviousness?</br></br>      <br>Fake list, no short hair girl should be above C rank.</br>  <br><br>You both will give me the artist's name, you get it? Do it NOW.</br></br>      Based Ash from XY doesn't have a soul.<br><br>OS Ash radiated personality, and was an infinitely funner character.</br></br>  <br>Game Serena &gt; Anime Serena</br>  <br> cancer <br>This list is as true as it can get.</br></br>  <br>He's learning, /a/non</br>  <br>She's dead, Jim</br>  May best pokegirl  <br>More cuteshit. There's more</br>    <br>I'll admit I didn't look at it and thought it was just longhairfag's usual shitlist spam<br><br>It's still pretty wrong though<br> Millefeui and Valerie that low </br></br></br></br>  <br>just look up serena_(pokemon) in gelbooru there are like 4 sets of serena getting fucked by pokemon there.</br>  <br>Cancer please leave</br>  Will she return?  Ash doesn't need a waifu. Have you guys not understood this yet? A waifu will only waste his time. He does fine on his own.  I heard that Ash is being treated as a reward between Serena and some other girl?  <br>What's in the box?</br>  <br><br>She is pure</br></br>  <br> Erika F-rank <br>Kill yourself</br></br>  <br> A+ <br>huh? surprising considering how much you guys dislike her</br></br>  <br>kek a rare exemplar of a Mistyfag</br>    <br>Mistyfag pls leave <br>Your autism is too much to bear</br></br>  <br><br>Man I'm not even a serenafag and I find this annoyingly autistic anon.</br></br>  <br>That's where the cute blonde skater girl belongs.</br>  <br>Don't worry, I'm not a mistyfag.<br><br>Unfortunately, /a/ seems to have its fair share:<br><br>https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1El<wbr>1f1F8zXviEONk5y0Uy2dntwVkCqrF_Hpyo5<wbr>j2yIWA/viewanalytics?usp=form_confi<wbr>rm</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>    So Bonnie knows, right?  <br><br>This level of delusion seriously frightens me. I mean the shipping stuff can get pretty retarded here on /a/ but this is legit mental illness levels of delusion.<br><br>How that artist watched "this Ash had a defining moment with Ash and has a crush on him and wanted to meet him" and instead saw "this girl is a crazed stalker who is mentally insane and dangerous" makes my brain hurt. I wish it was just a parody of crazy shipping, but this artist legit believes the shit they pulled out of their ass if the comments section is to be believed.<br><br>Especially hilarious since 90% of the stuff people use to justify the Misty/Ash ship was dub-text. So that's actually more delusional to ship than the Serena one which actually has the backing of the staff.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>she knows.<br>Whether it amounts to anything is unknown as of now.</br></br>  Is watching pokemon with /a/ equivalent to having friends over on weekends when we were kids?  <br>Oh, it was just longhairautist's list with the two Serenas swapped.<br><br>It's shit then. Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>disgusting</br></br></br>  <br>Even /vp/ has better taste than you, /pol/fag.<br><br/></br></br>  <br>assflute ruined everything</br>  <br> this girl had a defining moment <br>And that's what happens when you mess with default keyboard functions kids.<br><br><br>She probably knows to an extent I guess. Probably the only reason why she didn't try to hook her brother up with her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Has Serena done the typical thing were she denies she likes Ash?</br>  <br><br>I don't think she ever mentioned it, all I know is that she has her schemes to get closer to him</br></br>  Anybody else hyped for the new movid starring dragon master Ash commanding mega-rayquaza, mega-latios and latias?  <br>She's managed to avoid that question somehow. <br><br>Also note that Millefeui asked her a loaded/complex question in XY80, which she dodged pretty well</br></br></br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>Nope . She just blushes and tries changing the subject.</br>  <br>No, given we won't get to watch it for another half a year.</br>  <br>Hype for mega fugg</br>   tfw ash will never smile like this again   <br>Ash has fucking god-tier luck meeting mega rayray.</br>  <br><br><br>You know, I wonder how they would react if they knew about this . I wonder how hard it would trigger them if they knew that Masuda and the staff were into the Serena ship.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope they kill themselves.</br>  <br> implying we won't get camrip <br><br>we will get it r-right? ;_;</br></br></br>  <br>Shiny*</br>  <br>We got a 40 minute one last year</br>  <br>Is it going to be Mega? I thought Ray only went mega when it was near that huge ass stone that the Team flare guy took. <br><br>Also, does anybody know why Ray is Shiny in the movie? As far as I know I thought Ray was one of the "unique" legendaries.</br></br></br>  All these Serena and Misty fags. Feels bad to be a Mayfag these days.  Ash saved Serena from becoming 4chan:<br>if no Ash:<br> no never give up til the end <br> never traveled <br> she would had never learn about tripokalons <br> if she did she would had never had enough courage to face her mother about it <br> no fennekin <br> no pancham <br> no bonnie <br> no clemont <br> basically no friends <br> would still be a brat <br> would still be too self centered <br> still stuck at home <br> no dream </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey, it isn't too bad anon, I'm a Serenafag myself but I'm sure May will get some good treatment because of ORAS.</br>  <br>Hoopa just summoned a couple legendaries, so it probably just grabbed a shiny one because it looked cool.</br>  <br>You just got a new design, faggot.</br>  <br>Yep, it will evolve. It does in the manga adaptation of the movie.</br>    <br><br><br><br>It seems like Serena loves Ash and awful lot for about short their meeting was, if XY007 was any indication. <br><br>Doesn't she get paranoid everytime a girl might show an interest in him, and visa versa?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that this is the main Pokemon of the new movie.  <br>Yes, she does. Just look at episode 13 or 21.</br>  <br><br>We will get something</br></br>  <br>ugh typos. <br><br>*It seems like Serena loves Ash an awful lot for give how short their meeting was, if XY007 was any indication. *</br></br></br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>I fucked up again, I need sleep.</br>  <br>It only happened with Premiere, really, who was using kinda weird language she misinterpreted the meaning of.<br><br>Millefeui isn't subtle about wanting Ash at all, so that's hardly paranoia</br></br></br>   people still try to deny it   <br>Every time another girl talks to Ash Japan gets hit with another tidal wave of sweat and spaghetti</br>  <br>like this?</br>  I miss when the occasional threads on /a/ were a respite from the organized shitposting and overbearing shippershit on /vp/.<br><br>Who has been forcing these daily threads anyway?</br></br>    <br>some anon in /vp/ probably due to all the recent shitposting</br>   Maybe I should make a move on Ash too... <br><br>I feel like they've pushed this Ash/Serena as far as they can go.<br><br><br>Deny what?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It lacks PASSION, it lacks GRIT. It's all too clean.<br><br>It would make more sense if they actually aged him, and he became more boring as he grew up, but he's still 10 years old, he should still be crazy!</br></br></br>  <br>I'd say Ash finally is reaching puberty, but he's forever 10 years old.</br>    <br> Implying there's anything there to look at </br>  <br> Satoshi is into DFC </br>  <br>he is still crazy<br><br>he just channels it differently</br></br></br>  <br> This semen demon is a kindergarten teacher </br>  <br>It's true¬≤</br>  <br>Have you ever seen a kindergarten teacher? All the ones I know from taking my nephew to a day care are between 18 to 27 and are hot as hell. I don't know if they are actually hot or its the fact that they are kindergarten teachers that makes them hot but son...</br>  <br> he became more boring as he grew up, but he's still 10 years old, he should still be crazy! <br> when he recklessly climbs up the highest building in the city and try to talk it out with a Garchomp on a rampage <br> when he uses a bunch of balloon pokemon as stepping stones over a gigantic drop <br>Sounds just as crazy as ever to me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't she kinda look like Elle?<br>Hmmmm...</br></br>  Best waifu  <br><br>I think it's because all the people who want to be a teacher have this mistaken idea of "the younger the kids are, the easier they are to deal with", which they learn the hard way is untrue. <br><br>So the lower grade levels have very young teachers who haven't learned the harshness of reality yet. While middle-school and high-school have the older more apathetic teachers who know that teens are a pain in the ass, but are easier to work with than screaming children.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really, I consider all these short hair enablers my enemy. I thought I had /vp/ friends until they revealed their degenerate taste.<br><br>They're welcome to have their taste in women enhanced by taking the red pill.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget that he tanks attacks like nothing.</br>  <br> everybody except Ash knows it <br>Oh Japan.</br></br>  <br> responding to a post that had nothing to with hair whatsoever <br> responding just for the sake of being an asshat <br>Here's your reply</br></br></br>  <br><br>Not happening.<br><br><br>He will win.<br><br><br><br>Not bait.<br><br><br>Same shit than Naruto and she won.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "the younger the kids are, the easier they are to deal with", which they learn the hard way is untrue. <br>Does the same apply with autistic kids?<br> I chose elementary school when filling out the application for paraprofessional because I assumed changing the diaper of a kid would be easier than someone who could be bigger than me. I don't know if autistic kids are worse behaviorally than autistic teens or not. I just assumed they were the same. </br></br></br>  <br><br>She wanted the D</br></br>  <br><br>Crazy was the wrong choice of words on my behalf.<br><br>What I should've said is that he should still act like a stupid, naive 10 year old with a passion for adventure.<br><br>In XY, it's like he's been there and done that, and doesn't have nearly the same passionate enthusiasm as he did in the original series. When he's doing something crazy now, it's like he knows he can do it because he's based and it's like a routine thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Mistyfags still exist in 2015 <br>Let it go.</br>  <br>Is this real?</br>  <br>If I recall correctly from my old psych class (my knowledge might be pretty outdated). The older the autistic person, the easier they are to deal with for the most part. Simply because they are more used to the condition, while a child can easily become more frustrated with it.<br><br>But it really depends on which end of the spectrum they are on for the most part. General rule of thumb is that the older the kid, the easier they are to deal with in relative terms.</br></br></br>  <br> Her outfit is kinda shit though. </br>  <br>Best get rid of it then</br>  <br>That's about as futile as trying to tell Noefags to let it go. You might as well just sit back and drink their tears as this season continues on. Serena was a great addition for that alone.</br>  <br>I'm pretty found of it personally, I think it's very well coordinated for the most part. Could just be the hat though, it matches really well with her hair for some reason.</br>  <br>That does make sense.</br>  Daily reminder.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0dJ<wbr>XCNVA_vE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Serena confirmed she wanted to win the Ash in the recent episode right?

The premise is "the adventures of a magician's guild", but it really doesn't utilize that premise very much.<br><br>The storytelling is really cliche and lazy, fights included (nakama powerup: the manga), but the character antics are kinda fun, and the girls are hot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think scans of those last two are available in higher quality than has been already posted.</br>  <br><br>She really shouldn't have been redeemed.</br></br>   tfw, you will never get a hairjob from Flare. <br>Why even live?</br>    will she get tetanus?<br><br><br>also<br> didn't progress at all in one year </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>mashima's a closet footfag<br><br>I can sense these things</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> you will never shove your face in Flare's boobs during one of her crazed tilty poses or while she's freaking out over something </br></br>  <br>See bottom question</br>  <br>What a fucking faggot.</br>  <br> actually crying for fairy tail <br>how? the problem get resolved literally the next chapter.</br></br>  <br>Lucy's father died and stayed dead.</br>  <br>that made you cry? it was sad yeah but the way it happened so suddenly was like"oh, welp there goes any chance of him coming back" like there was no build up, it just happened.</br>  <br>Here, read this. It's from the end of a one-shot Mashima wrote named Christmas Hearts. Since you apparently missed the memo, it should give you an idea of why Mashima would tear up a bit while writing about some character's father suddenly passing away.</br>      I would put my cock inside wendy and leave it there for days. Follow her everywhere with my dick inside her.  <br>based Gaston, I'm so glad that he likes this garbage.</br>  <br>Fairy tail is shounen for the cancer masses. <br>feetfags = cancer<br><br>It's only obvious he would do that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck you, she just had a huge ladyboner for Erza and was too autistic to express it like a normal person</br>    <br><br>She tortured Lucy and Millianna. It wasn't for a mission, or out of a sense of loyalty; it was because she wanted to. As far as female Fairy Tail characters are concerned, she might be the most evil.<br><br>And perhaps more importantly, she's not very likable, and by Fairy Tail standards, she's not horribly attractive, either. There's no reason for her take up screentime or panel time when just about every other reoccurring member of the female cast is better. She should have simply died as a villain.</br></br></br></br>  <br>maxfile.ro Pomf's clone</br>  Sheesh, sometimes I miss this manga, if only for the delicious girls.<br><br>I dropped it around 20 volumes in because the stories felt repetitive, but every time I see these threads I feel like reading it again.</br></br>  <br><br>That's funny, because I dropped it about 20 chapters back.</br></br>  I want to rape Lucy.  <br><br>That tennis Erza drawing is a god send<br><br><br>I know how you feel. You'd think with previews like that people would be more motivated to get them but for some reason no one has.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't wait for her eventual side change and Mashima drawing her in other sexy outfits.</br>  <br>GSC ERZA WHEN</br>  <br>He just cant stop making best girls.</br>    <br>Why cant Gray just fuck her?</br>    <br>He's gay.</br>  <br>Why doesn't he just draw porn?</br>  <br>And make a lot less money?

PTSD fucks you up.</br>    <br><br> Dat cheesy 70s porno music playing during the scene <br>They never did explain what she was so frightened of, so it's safe to assume rape.</br></br></br>  <br>Renge has always been in denial about being a country girl and Natsumi always enables her by telling her that they're not living in the countryside whenever she asks about it.<br><br>Nii-san pretty much shatters her delusions, the first time he ran away from him was when he saw him chewing on grass, something a country boy would do.<br><br>The second time it happens was in here , they all went to the store together without Nii-san and yet they bumped into him anyway which shows how small the village really is, totally the countryside.<br><br>At least that's my take on it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> une </br>  <br>she*</br>  I want to gangrape a Biyori.  <br>PARADIGM SHIFT</br>  <br>If they have to drive to the story, the village can't be that small, it's not like a city where there is a shop on every corner.</br>  <br>and yet they bumped into Nii-san anyway.</br>  <br> the village can't be that small <br>Hint: "small village" refers to the population, not the area. A lot of rural municipalities are physically very large.</br></br>  ONE DAY AND 5 HOURS MOTHERFUCKERS  <br>I used to think that onii-san hadnt been in the car with them, so renge was freaked out at the idea he had walked there himself or something, but the more /a/ forces this rape thing, the less certain I am either way.</br>  <br> translated  <br>SAUCE?</br></br>  <br> no loli to hug while waiting </br>  <br>According to Google, the average human cycling speed is 15.5 km/h and they say the store is 2 hour away on a bike, so about 31 km to the nearest store.</br>  <br>I'd rather fug a loli, honestly.</br>  <br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/a<wbr>8sriuhw8350qj7/Koma-chan+ENG+v2.zip<wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>sticky icky</br>  Natsumi is PERFECT    Last season of NNB, I enjoyed downloading the scenery porn of the episodes from 2chan.

Renge though that going overseas would change her and her worldview, which put her in a little existential crisis. The point in the store was essentially a no going back point because they were buying things for the trip.<br><br>I swear some of the autistic fucks on /a/ are so fucking stupid.

He tends to go entermates when his friends are around and dragons when he (thinks) he's alone. Why?</br>  <br>I wonder what's the Pendulum Pair when he enters Yugo state.</br>  <br>Why would you not attack 3 times if you have the chance?</br>  <br><br>Malfunction</br></br>  Does this look like a Yuzu?<br><br>Maybe he's weaning off his Yuzu.flac</br></br>  <br>Probably gonna be a pair of wizards that look like Yugo and Rin</br>  <br><br>It can only attack 3 monsters</br></br>  <br>As a comparison, Yuma has lost 34 times over the course of Zexal (9 on screen).</br>  <br><br>It's a Mieru</br></br>  <br><br>What?<br><br>On screen losses he has Yuzu (if that even counts), Reiji and now Jack. I don't remember any other losses</br></br></br></br>  <br> pinkish hair <br> fringe <br>Eh, close enough.</br></br></br>  <br>I wish Yuya would eventually defeat Reiji. But it probably won't happen and Reiji will lose to somebody else and develop that way.</br>  <br>Well it's got Pink hair</br>  <br><br>DARINGU</br></br>  <br>anon probably also meant his offscreen tournament losses that were shown in episode 2.</br>  <br><br>This rather looks like an entermage<br> It's eff would also fit better into entermage </br></br></br>  <br>From his duel record in the second episode<br><br>And that anon is wrong anyway, Yuya has lost 24 duels + Yuzu, Reiji, and Jack which makes 27</br></br></br>  <br>MORE MIERU WHEN?</br>  <br>Shun, please man.</br>  <br>Wait, what? Who're you referring to?</br>    <br>After having to listen to her crush go on and on about how great some other girl was? Probably never.</br>  <br>Damn it Yuya when will you get a Tuner monster<br><br>Pendulum Synchro would be so based. I can even hear Kensho Ono saying "SYNCHRO SHOKAN" in my head, I just need to see it happen</br></br></br>  <br>Yuya looks so fucking good whenever he takes his swag-cape off. I love his body.</br>  <br>Never hopefully</br>  <br>Masumi would only reappear to die for Yuzu or get killed by Yuzu.</br>  <br>Will we eventually see him hugging Yuzu without his cape? I mean, that way Yuzu can properly appreciate his body.</br>  <br>Why is that skirt so hot</br>  <br>Somebody put me out of my misery</br>  <br>LITERALLY<br>SEX<br>It's not a shirtless scene, bu I guess it does the job.</br></br></br>  <br>Even if I am a Yuzu fag, that is just a Mieru reference for her fans, I mean come on. Also based Y. Aoi</br>  <br>Dem dragons wanna mate</br>  <br>Being Ruka is endless suffering</br>  How would everyone react if Jack actually lost from Rune-Eyes?  <br>Isn't that what that anon implies?</br>  <br> twig composure with ridiculous chest <br>What in the world</br></br>  <br>Perfect masterrace EGAO genes</br>  <br>How their reacting in your image.</br>  So it looks like Yuzu and Yugo run into the arena to help Yuya<br><br>I wonder how he'll react to seeing her with Yugo</br></br>  <br>I really miss Mieru.<br>I hope she return for the last arc or the series.</br></br>  <br><br> clone stole my citrus <br><br> so I'll stole hers <br><br> LET'S GO TO ACADEMIA GUISE </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He sounded like he wanted to punch Jack in the face</br>  <br>I think it's more like Jean is gonna catch them and the board let them stay.</br>  <br>his*</br>  <br>They are in the arena</br>  YUYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA   OP changes to reflect JOHANNN being missing <br> Everybodys EGAO is gone <br>Greatest love story in history</br></br>  <br>Roger gets mad and smacks his chessboard at one point - do the council fuck him over, or does Jack intervene and punch out the Security shitters? Either way, it looks like Chess-kun does not get his chekkomeito next weekend.</br>  <br><br>What did Crow say in Yuya's mind? Sounded like he had something to say about Jack.<br><br>WHY THE FUCK HAVEN'T WE SEEN CROW'S REACTION TO JACK THIS EPISODE</br></br></br></br>  <br>We did, at the very beginning<br><br>He called Jack a traitor</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why won't Yugo get ported away?</br></br>  <br>Yeah, lots Action duel naturally makes a great body.</br>  <br> Implying there will not be another Mieru in each dimension. <br>But I miss Mieru too.</br></br>   Still no Yusei <br> Probably no Yusei <br><br>Fuck this shit</br></br></br>  <br>He called him a traitor of the commons. <br><br><br>Bracelet has a range.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Shit I missed the beginning of the episode</br></br>  <br>Because Yuya will. <br>Bracelet ships Yugo/Yuzu.</br></br>  <br>Wait for the great appearance of Lancers B team.</br>  <br>I wonder if Yuya will get an arc where he's the villain like Jaden</br>  <br> Previous MC <br>That is not how it works.</br></br>  <br>Yusei would steal the spotlight, and he's a previous MC.</br>  Is it just me or are Raidraptors pretty fucking cool?  <br>Seems like the shilling is affecting you just as planned.</br>  <br> inb4JudaiYugi <br><br>I mean I get that, but it's not like Yusei didn't play a pivotal part of their lives, in what they're playing off as an alternate reality. It's almost off putting</br></br></br>  <br>I want this, I enjoyed judai being a villain.</br>  <br>Possibly. The whole Yuya/Yuzu thing does have striking similarities with Judai/Johan, aside from one being gay and one not being gay.</br>  <br>No, that's when they introduce the participants the next day. Yuya was dueling at night.</br>  <br> Sawatari will get BTFO by Yuya similarly to how Jim lost to Haou Judai, and Sawatari will get carded. <br> Gongenzaka will force a tie with Yuya, sacrificing himself to make Yuya EGAO, so Gongenzaka also gets carded. <br> Yuya cannot EGAO because he basically killed two of his nakama. <br> One of them being Gongenzaka, who is basically the 2nd most important friend in his life after Yuzu. <br> Yuya tries to duel without using Pendulums in one episode because MUH ZETSUBOU. <br><br>I prefer Edge Mode Yuya to MUH ENTERTAINMENT Yuya.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's Yuzu who goes evil instead </br>  <br>Yuya isn't there. Which make me think Yuya isn't one of the participants. Also since Yugo is out in the open we can all expect a 'Yuya!' from the Lancers team at least.</br>  <br> They both go evil together <br> Rule a new world of overflowing darkness and pain while holding hands </br></br>  <br> If this card is in your hand: You can Fusion Summon 1 Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck, using "D/D" monsters from your hand as Fusion Materials, including this card. <br><br>He inspired by Reiji?</br></br></br>  <br> Jim <br><br>Fuck man. I forgot how much I liked that guy.</br></br></br>  <br>*He was</br>  <br>I loved his nicknames<br> Tomorrow Girl <br> Dino Boy </br></br></br>  <br>Wrong image</br>  <br><br>Crow is pretty much side character Yusei anyway so no need for two Yusei's</br></br>   Melissa facing the crowd on the long sides of the arena <br> People on the two ends get her huge holographic butt in their faces <br>How lucky do you have to be</br></br>  <br> Gongenzaka will force a tie with Yuya, sacrificing himself to make Yuya EGAO, so Gongenzaka also gets carded. <br>I really want this to happen again.</br></br>  <br> Yaiba v Gon-chan was a fucking great match <br> The dub will ruin it with shitty accents, some kind of sword puns, and Gon throwing in one line about "having a blast" or some other shit like that <br><br>RIP in piece Yugioh popularity in the west</br></br></br></br>  So<br> Special Summoned Aria and a Fusion Melodious <br> Have a Poly and Defusion <br> Can you use any of those cards with Aria effect being applied? </br></br></br>  <br> implying Gon won't get an archetype Relay Soul to take a gorillion shots from Antique Gear Soldiers as he holds off Academia for Yuya to escape </br>  <br>You can use Poly, because it doesnt target, its like Dark Hole. Cant use Defusion whilee Arias on the field</br>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br>Why won't Gongenzakafags fuck off? He only lost to Yuya, the main character, which is by far not a bad feat.<br><br>Meanwhile, Yuzu lost to Masumi, Dennis, would've lost to Yuri and probably Halil. Yuzufags had to take way more.<br><br>I hope Crow beats him just because.</br></br></br></br></br>  How come nobody is on about how OP Reiji is? Seriously, the guy seems like he's playing with his damn food whenever he's dueling.  <br>Because they're all Lancers who ate the 2000 LP intrusion penalty that he left on their Duel Disks.</br>  Chapter is out http://imperialscans.com/read/tokyo<wbr>-ghoul-re/36-suddenly/1</wbr>  <br>ishida realized he didn't have enough marketable waifus in his manga and threw her back in</br>  <br> ishida realized he didn't have enough marketable waifus <br>Well, in reality he hasn't, less males and more potential waifus, please.</br></br>  <br>Why is so fucking edgy?</br>  <br>We are getting a full chapter just to introduce her to the story, aren't we? <br>Well, at least add Saiko's brother.</br></br>  <br>Eh?

Murata drew alternate cover for Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows #4  <br>Bretty gud</br>  <br>he's probably subconsciously aware that he straight up breaks the no limits fallacy.<br>i think the thing is that saitama probably believes that if he could do it, someone else probably could too, and he wants to fight that guy.</br></br>  <br>I'd read anything Murata draws.</br>  <br><br>Its still written by ONE.</br></br></blockquote>]
