[ Time for a naruto spoiler anticipation thread  Hope we get answers soon, but knowing sauce.... yeah sorry  Riddle me this /naruto/: Ninja society has advanced to the point of sophisticated DNA testing software</span> Still no automatic weapons</span> Tenten doesn't sell guns</span> why?      Cancer thread.  /a/ is dead.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Sj4<wbr>obDjhuvU</wbr></span> [ ]  Waiting on TL Anon  Also, Sarada's voice is a bit squeakier than I imagined       tumblr</span>     agreed, it's not that fucking hard to change a filename OP     So Boruto is a naruto clone after all     having autism</span>     Being a cancerous, autist Narutard in the first place.</span>  Go back to tumblr where you belong.     Not familiar with Evil's posting pattern but I know we got early Tuesday spoilers last week, does her not posting anything today mean the chapter is boring as shit or so exciting that she wants to keep people on their toes?  fuck off    wanting tumblr to think it's welcome here.</span>     cancer general   Bolt trailer  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oWK<wbr>4dyO1E5s</wbr></span> [ ]            If you don't like naruto leave the thread          <span class="quote">&gt;that Salad voice</span>   Yeah it sounds meh. Boruto's would be better for her.     It's not about liking Naruto or not liking Naruto. You know /a/ hates tumblr and that there's a good reason why it does, yet your lazy ass couldn't be bothered to change a file name.  The mods have been generous enough to allow us more Naruto threads than they have in a long time, the last thing we need is idiots posting crap from tumblr here and not even trying to hide it.      <span class="quote">&gt;24/7 general naruto thread</span>  Not so elitists anymore huh /a/.     Dad is Ninja president/God and has to work a lot</span> still clearly a loving guy and makes an effort by having clones around to play with his kid</span> clones that allow him to retain the memories of their time together</span> "IT'D BE BETTER IF I DIDN'T HAVE PARENTS AT ALL!!!!"</span> go to bond with the guy who hasn't contacted his child in 12 years and almost fucking killed her</span>  Yeah I can't sympathize with Bolt, he's a shit.           at first I thought the trailer was sped up when I heard her     Why do Narutofags get so butthurt over the littlest things?    she hasn't aged a day    Naruto is the gateway etc. Go away.      Sounds like Konohamaru's voice.     The mods have been generous enough to allow us more Naruto threads than they have in a long time,</span>  What Naruto is anime/manga, they should never have been deleting any Naruto threads period.        OH shit that's what I get for spending one single day off /a/. When did this image come out? Is there a video along with it?    Cry more, newfag cancer.  There's a reason  exists.  You Narutards are the equivalent of them.         Guns are useless when Ninja Magic exists      Just one years ago Narutards were only allowed to have one thread a week.  Where did everything go wrong?       Cry for what?   So why did this guy announce the series was ending and then start it back up again like two weeks later?      money     Her smile and optimism: gone</span>    The answer to why anyone does anything.    See if pinkshit were his mom, she would've put the fear of god in him. And he wouldn't be such a little bitch. Some kids just need to be beaten.    If anything, its the moefag threads that should be banned.    So that's a birthday party. What about the cake throwing is that true?    Typical cancerous Narutards right there.     moefag</span><br/>      Bolt wants to be hard, but his mom won't let him...so he ran off with Uncle Sauske.  Also, Naruto is a better dad to Sauske's kid than Sauske is lol       are you by chance, a retard?    it's in the trailer     Why not infuse the guns with ninja magic?    Typical pedophile right there  why don't you fuck off pedoshit      YEah, it's almost like kids do stupid shit or something.   why is this shit-tier reddit series still not over?    They deleted threads before because when Naruto was at its highest popularity, Naruto threads opened the door to all the most cancerous and autistic elements of its fanbase from Gaia and other assorted places of the internet that /a/ generally hated.  Now they're letting /a/ have them again and you want to fuck that up by putting a tumblr file name in the OP when you should know by now that doing so is just asking your thread to get shitposted? Either you're a newfag from tumblr or a crossboarder from /co/. Either way, just don't do it again.      omg narutow is so le epic xDDDD!!!1!!1! all haters should stfu and gtfo !!!11!!! naruxsaku 5evr       She really is Sauce with a vagina.     show/manga is extremely popular</span> people want to discuss things they like</span> higher popularity means more people like it</span> more people liking it means more people that want to discuss it</span> discussion of anime or manga belongs on /a/</span> Naruto is, indeed, an anime and a manga</span>  [Naruto] = [anime/manga]</span> discussion of [anime/manga] belongs on /a/</span> discussion of [Naruto] belongs on /a/</span> You don't see /v/ blacklisting Halo or Dota You don't see /tv/ blacklisting GoT or Seinfeld You don't see /sp/ blacklisting the NFL or MLB                 Well you needs to be very strong to do that. Guns don't require training and is able to claim easy life. Even if guns are ineffective against high level ninja, they could be more advance just like jutsus.    she hasn't aged a day</span> Superior Hyuuga genetics.     stop samefagging the thread    So its ok to welcome more cancer and normalfags on /a/?  Good to know that this board is gonna fall soon like all the others.     God I want to fuck Sarada's butt.   Just need some chakra bullets    normalfags</span>   Oh boy here we go <br/>        literally my first post today you fucking mong    It's true. Also aparently the other Kages will fight against the eye-handed faggot. They probably job, but it's a cool think to look for.      Bolt literally repeated a part one Sakura line and she stills gets shit on /a/ for it today   <span class="quote">&gt;Konohamaru in charge of teaching</span>     TL Anon posted this in the last thread  Jiraiya/Narrator: The sun shines over all of Konoha.

Every other threads are dead but this.      It is really becoming more and more obvious of the one common trait of those whom furiously froth from their cavity filled, decaying mouths whilst pecking at their keyboards decrying moe.  They are all underaged shonenfags.  Show me an Index fan. I'll tell you a tale of a child who would love nothing more than to viciously assault the Hirasawas.  Show me a wan piss fag. I'll tell you a tale of a child who once threw up a mixture of mountain dew, pocky, twinkies, and bacon at there mere sight of a wideface (If there is a manga built for the ADHD child of today it is definitely wan piss).   In their teenage angst they cannot understand moe. Do not hate them for hating moe. They are simply not mature enough to indulge themselves in it, or to simply ignore it if that is their prerogative. Hate them because they are underaged shonenfags shitting up /a/ with an endless onslaught of Sasuke with vectors topics.  (It is also an interesting look into the heart of an underaged shonenfag when you see their uncontrolled rage at Naruto &amp; Sasuke. The symbolism in Naruto hits a bit too close to home for them it seems.)               Who gets to say what is "cancer" and what isn't? You, a random anon nobody cares about? Should all popular, mainstream anime be banned from /a/?   Better not see any DBZ, Bleach, One Piece, Monogatari, Nisekoi, Evangelion, Ghibli, Gundam, or Yugioh threads then!      [I can't write anything greater than this! - Masashi Kishimoto]</span>    Cuckura has been around longer doing more dumb things. Bolt is at a relatively clean slate for his list of stupid things.    Stupid Boruto! I'm the one who will become Hokage!</span>      arent ninjas only like 3% of the population? im sure many of the non chakra users could use guns    b-but the normies</span> /a/ is dying</span>  Yeah i've been hearing that since a couple of years, stop trying to fit in, newshit.       Monogatari and Eva aren't complete fucking garbage so they can stay, but I'd be perfectly fine with the rest of them fucking off for good as well.    You sound like a faggot. Naruto threads should never have been deleted period. And they still shouldn't no matter what.    moefags </span>  calling anyone underaged</span>  haahahahahahhaa       When are you Narutards gonna fuck off? How long is this garbage gonna last for? Another 10 years again?  please keep shitting in my mouth Kishimoto-sama!</span>    Shitty anime with even shittier fillers.  I'm so excited...   Just ignore the shitposters and discuss the new trailer.   aren't complete garbage</span> According to critics, Japs, and fans, neither is Naruto :^)     I was thinking that,    you think that can make the bullet go faster or heat seeking?   <span class="quote">&gt;people are seriously defending naruto in 2015</span>  <span class="quote">&gt;he's wearing Nurudu's jacket and Sauce's headband</span> Jesus fucking Christ why don't you just wear Salad's shattered hopes and dreams like badges of war, you evil little shit?    [I can't write anything greater than this! - Masashi Kishimoto]</span>    That is what filters are for anon.    [I can't write anything greater than this! - Masashi Kishimoto]</span>  That said the movie looks like it could be fun.      Monogatari and Evangelion are both targeted towards adults, which is what /a/ used to consist of before the shonenfag invasion. Naruto, on the other hand is a manga for children which are not allowed on /a/, as it is specifically an 18+ website. Therefore, there's a place for Monogatari and Evangelion here, while Naruto, DBZ, and One piece are not welcome and never will be.    ignoring the cancer will make it go away</span>  No you Narutards spread to other threads like flies.  posting 3dpd on /a/</span>  of course im not suprise.          at least she'll get her stand armor with that thought.    Whoa there nigger, back up. I'm 25 and love the fuck out of DBZ.    Seeing as how Boruto is being trained by Naruto and Sasuke, he will inevitably get Sage Mode. Only way for Sarada to keep up would be her getting Mangekyo and Susanoo so her suffering must continue.    I'm 25 and love the fuck out of DBZ.</span> Maybe physically but certainly not mentally.     yet your lazy ass couldn't be bothered to change a file name.</span> You know the reason tumblr images are hated is because they resize and fuck up your image quality right? They are usually small as fuck gifs with artifacts and shit. Of course the community is even worse than the naruto community. I don't even care about naruto on /a/ anymore, as long as they don't get anal devastated and post fucking 4 threads at the same time. Fuck you guys.        [I can't write anything greater than this! - Masashi Kishimoto]</span>     i love how the hokage carvings on the mountain look asian lol     I can't like light-hearted things anymore</span> I watch mature anime for mature people like myself</span> No anon, you're the child.     I don't get it, why is Naruto's son such a little cunt? Even when Naruto was a cunt at least it was backlash from the constant alienation and disdain he got from the rest of the village. But Bolt has two loving parents and a village that welcomes his as the son of a great hero.   Puberty.    That's what kids are like, anon.    shut up nerd    Hes a spoiled brat. And doesnt understand his father.   <span class="quote">&gt;The thing Kaguya was afraid of is just some generic bishie</span>  Boo i wanted a monster or badass old man/woman.    Fuck off Narutards.  You cancerous crossboarder have overstayed your welcome.     He's just a little shit for no reason. However since he's 12 years old, his shitness isn't cute. Naruto and Sasuke were throwing their bodies in the way of lethal attacks for their friends at that age. Boruto's throwing his little sister's birthday cake.    because sarada is way more mature and perfect. Tobirama had it all wrong.   I see from the trailer that Sauce has chosen a less edgy style of clothing  good for him    It surprises me how, each time some new Naruto stuff appears, Bort manages to be more of a little shit than the last time.  Never forget.   Waiting for Sarada's chakra chains   So it's ayyyliens after all?      <br/>   Uchiha, pls    so who did kaguya fucked for her to shit out op twins?     Yes because all 12 year olds even with parents are angels right?     ill keep pushing this</span>   Shino and Tenten are hanging out, I guess.   I guess sarada was lucky that naruto was hokage. The 3rd hokage was incompetent at this kind of shit.    The romance of magic is more interesting than guns?    No. What does that have to do with him being a little shit.    What could be traumatic enough for her to awaken the Mangekyo? After that, it's only a matter of getting a transplant from Onion to get EMS.    Because chakra pretty much trumps most of that. I mean, have you SEEN Kurama?  Anyway, the Lightning Village created a chakra cannon that had enough power to tear the moon asunder. And they kept it totally hidden from every other Village.      10/10 and Shino have replaced Anko and that faggot nobody cares about</span> Truly a fate worse than death.  captcha is birthday cake</span>       tenten is still the weakest ninja that use weapon no one cares</span> shino's bug jutsu always getting overshadowed.</span>      not him, Sarada needs something if she's going become Hokage. May as well give her the chains.     Everything, anon. Everything. Besides, he's not that bad. He only acts that way to his dad, and that doesn't even last long consider they make up before the kidnapping.    They're on 2 different teams, are nothing alike, one is a teacher and the other a weapon's salesmen. Why would they be hanging out I wonder.    Naruto should've given a beatdown to Boruto for upsetting his mum like that.    imply pinkshit won't die at the end of manga</span> imply sarada won't have her stand armor just before the movie</span>     Not wanting ninjafu to be as broken as possible</span> Although the previous female Hokage was also a useless    Fuck off Narutards.   Shes not an Uzumaki though    He only acts that way to his dad</span>  What no, he ruined his little sister's birthday cake while Naruto wasn't even there.      do i fit in guise</span>     She's not an Uzumaki though</span>     Sakura is in the movie    her moms Karin tho   ITT: shounenfags with their shit taste   That filename</span> Kek tfw I was more interested in KANA-BOON performing the theme-song</span>  They just can't take a break       This is why we should never spoonfeed. Normals like these come here and feel welcome without bothering to lurk. Forcing their opinions onto the already settled regulars on the board like they're somehow superior.   Good job /b/-- I mean /a/. Well, soon we'll be /ba/ anyway so what's the difference.   Let's have another anime recommendation thread xD No wait, how about we try to make someone read a manga by posting an awesome page!!       being a cuckfag</span>     "Step one, you all have to turn into naked girls. Sarada, you've obviously got a head start on the other two."</span>    Happy birthday to the ground</span>    Hinata is a doormat to his children</span> Well, Sakura isn't the only one, then.   Don't ruin anon's turkish ninjanovela        well then kairn is gonna die.    sigh that little shit has gone and done it    that photo</span> Of all the photos he could have in his office, he chose the one with his toddler son.   Goddammit Bort.       See    Yep. Settle in for the long haul, anon. Until literally every mod and janitor delete all of our threads every day, we'll hang around.  Better get used to it.     Fuck off.   Because his dad, jackass.     it's not my fault Kishi has an NTR fetish  Though is it really NTR if Sakura and Sasuke haven't even kissed?       Wasn't explained in the manga that she got the sharingan from the happiness that came with the illusion of meeting sasuke?    Seriously, stop samefagging    b-but she literally has Uzumaki DNA      Happy birthday to the ground</span> At least he had the common sense to drop it plate-side up.    How could you let her get so sad, /a/?   Looks like the set of a porn movie.     mmmm whatcha say.jpg</span>    This parent shouldn't have been there from the beginning!</span>  Sarada and Shikadai should really beat up this faggot's ass.     Fuck off already.    i threw it on the ground</span>     Oh shit, what if there's an inner Sarada fueling her Sharinhax?    It's not ok to lash out at other people because you're upset with someone else. He should have taken it out on Naruto, not Himawari but he is a little shit.    I doubt she'll even show in Gaiden. Shes just a plot device being used in a bad red herring    her smile and optimism gone </span>  Also who wants to bet she was concerned for Bort and tried talking to him about it after?     So is this basically the same shit that we've had 800 chapters of already except now the characters are even worse? Why are you still reading this crap?   oh boy here we go hinata haters  gonna shit now on hinata because she is a shitty mother and doesnt do against boruto     not my fault her shitty son smash the cake that she tenderly spent hours making    I bet that ugly Uchiha girl has been telling poor, sweet, innocent Bort to become an asshole to Hinata.     The Anti-Uchiha theory was killed when her Sharingan re-activated after saying she didn't give a damn about Sakura.      See    Narutards.  They don't care about anything else other then Naruto.      No, it wasn't okay. I was just explaining his reason for doing it.    Because ninja Maury.    Still looks 19 when she's 35.    No.    Strong emotions trigger it, i thought that was obvious     Shitty mother</span> Yeah but at least she was there for her kids  In all honesty, Hinata would be #1 mum       nah, it's now a ninjanovela  Why are you still reading this crap?</span> I'm only reading this, I can't tell 90% of what passes as plot in Nurudu      ITT: Shows with catchy OP's   Monogatari series    Yeah https://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=X1M69<wbr>l7ZGlw</wbr></span> [ ]    <span class="quote">&gt;not posting the catchiest of them all</span> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=uvb<wbr>aM-URygs</wbr></span> [ ]    I hate this so so much.

I like when monstergirls have weird vaginas that dont look human. When you slap a human vagina on a snake monstergirl or a frog girl or whatever it just looks boring, they need interesting vaginas in order for them to be sexy.    Something like Harpy lolis having cloaca instead of the usual human parts?    What are your thoughts on dwarf lolis? Beards or no beards?    Refer to Outbreak Company.    yeah, its interesting.   The weirder the vagina, the more of an adventure it would seem to fuck such a thing. Which is why i think is why monstergirls are so popular, its the adventure humoring the idea of what it would be like fucking some alien creature. But thats just my opinion.    i dont like lolis with beards.         Which one, Rin or Ophis? <s>Either way you're wrong.</s>     But how would you know she's a dwarf if she doesn't have a beard?      Where does it end? You got to think about it.    Fuck no I ain't!

I wish these threads could last forever   Nothing is sadder than coming home from work and seeing the thread dead.    Sorry, I'm re-reading the last thread right now, so I'm a little preoccupied.  How about a topic to get the ball rolling then?     I bet Yui wears slutty underwear.   Unfortunately I'm technically at work right now so I can't participate as much.     I like to believe she doesn't wear underwear. Sweaty Yui butt.     Yui's butt is so fat that it gets really sweaty. She goes nopan so she can let her stuff breathe.    It took quite some time but finally we are back to sweaty, greasy yuyu buttholes and sniffing/licking them. Great.    Butt sniffing is best fetish.   I don't get this joke. Why is Yuzuko embarrassed? Is this going over my head because I'm out of touch? <s>Holy shit am I sheltered?</s>   Sniffing Yui is universally acceptable.    All of the Yuyus are sniffable.  Thinking about writing a Yuyushiki fapfic. Anyone have any fun ideas?      What does Yui smell like?    Strong pheromone plus that nice shampoo smell.    Yuyus going on an anonymous imageboard and making posts about anon's sweaty butthole and sniffing it.    Wasn't the joke a bad pun? That can be embarrassing sometimes.    And how she'd massage our prostates while giving head.     I can dig it.     Have pee in it somehow. Its always a good idea. Or at least even if no one else reads it, you at least have me to read it.    Well, I like watersports.    Watersports are okay, but I am more of an omorashi guy. At least someone else shares my love of pee even if its not in the same way as I do.    Then make the two puppets lock Yui in the toilet, then they realize they have to go too, but now she locks them out.

I don't mind manual labour much it feels more rewarding than an office based job    I do love it most of the time, sometimes it gets a bit redundant, but the people I work with make it enjoyable.   I agree, I would take a manual labor job over an office job any day of the week if they payed the same. But the upper level of manual labor does not even begin to hit the bottom tier of office work in the civilian world.        After being in school so long, freedom is kind of scary.    The power in my house went out. What do you do when the power goes out, /yys/? I'm sitting here in the dark.   Use the internet from my phone, like I assume you're doing now?    I would sleep.

I usually just read manga on my phone while worrying about all the meat in the freezer. Or go to bed.   What kind of jobs do you think the yuyus will have when they get older? I think Yui will become a vampire.    Bean salesman.     Yukari will be rich as fuck because of her family so she wont need a job, Yuzu will become a teacher and Yui will work some shitty dead end job before she realizes that either Yukari or Yuzuko loved her and then she will go move in with one of them and come to terms with her<s> by nip nong standards anyways</s> sexual deviancy and live a long happy life devoid of sorrow.

I don't really blame them, it is somewhat frustrating sometimes when you are trying to have a discussion and it suddenly turns super gay or fetishy. Right now is not one of those times for me, so if you want to talk about fetishes, I am all ears. Even the ones I do not partake in I like to hear about. I like to learn things about people and motivations about what crazy stuff gets them off. Also pee fetish is best fetish, I like you already.    tfw no one to bend me over and pee all over my butt. Or let me blow them and after they cum in my mouth and I've swallowed their cum, they let their dick go flaccid and pee down my throat.   You're gonna get the thread deleted again guys. Hell, I don't know, maybe that's what you want. Whatever.   Ive always kind of wondered why pee fetish always seems to be so prevalent with the CGDCT fanbase. I thought that maybe it was just me, but its shown up a lot recently. Which I am totally okay with. I just wonder why It seems so prevalent with "moeshit"   Mods are probably asleep right now anyways  <s>post sinks</s>         I guess this is what happens when no topic.    I have no idea. Pee is love though.  I've also noticed that /yys/ seems to have a large amount of people into butt worship/sniffing, which is great, since that is literally my biggest fetish. Butts are so good.      There hasn't been a topic for a couple of years and this ERP has seemingly only been a recent occurrence.   Truth be told, I haven't been around much recently.     &gt;&gt;&gt;/ghost/   Butts are great, since nice looking butts require hard work.    The butt worshiping thing has been fairly prevalent since the K-on Generals were in full strength. The Strike Witches Generals gave me a pantyhose fetish so I cant say that the generals only had bad consequences  <s>Especially since the K-on generals gave me a butt fetish and the SW generals convinced me to buy pantyhose and panties to wear by myself. Also socks. Why are womens socks so much better then mens socks. I suggest that everyone just wear womens socks from now on, way more comfortable. </s>      Butts are so lovely. A nice butt is a thing of wonder.   I miss the K-ON generals. I still make K-ON threads sometimes, though they often get deleted for lewd.   <s>I want to give someone a prostate massage. Or give them a rimjob while stroking them off.</s>         I used to dislike K-On back then, but I gave it a chance and realized that everyone was just talking shit. YotsubaC was still a crazy fuck though. I wish I had pulled the stick out of my ass and watched it when it came out.  <s>Legit if you were in the area I would totally be okay with getting one of those, but this is neither the time nor the place to go straight up /soc/ or /lgbt/. Maybe its just because I am hella drunk right now but I would totally fuck an anon right now.</s>       S2    just when you think a thread gonna be good but then this happens yall niggas gross as fuck     Wow, I totally forgot about YotsubaC. He was certainly a crazy one. I get the feeling that a lot of people that don't like K-ON would probably enjoy it if they actually gave it a chance. It's such an incredibly charming show. Been one of my favorites since S2 aired back in 2009.   <s>I wouldn't mind. I always say that the best way to enjoy lewd things is with friends, so doing kinky stuff with someone from these threads sounds fun.</s>      Monthly erp invasion ;_;    Yeah I know, we always show up and fuck up the thread. I don't blame you for getting irritated, Sorry that you have to put up with us for so long.   I actually ended up watching K-on because a normalfag friend of mine wanted to watch it after it showed up in the previews in some DVD he bought. I think he ended up liking it even more then I did actually.  <s>Ive done kinky stuff with people before, but never anyone in these threads, I bet that would be fun as fuck even if everyone was weird and awkward and the illusion was totally shattered. Would not be the first time Ive had that happen.</s>        Go back to ghost, don't get the thread deleted.  Writing a summary for the last thread, if this one gets deleted before I post it (which may be a while yet) I'll ghostpost it in the archive of this thread.   Awkward /yys/ lewd times sounds fun.    Maybe some other time but  is right, I don't really want the thread to get deleted so we should probably just chill for awhile. If you need me I will always be in these threads somewhere. Nice talking to you though.    /yys/ Melee tournament when?   Post it in the next thread. If you post on ghost not many would get to see it.    suma bura</span> tfw main Jigglypuff</span>     Jiggs is really fun in 64 and Melee.  <s>Sm4sh is terrible and I stopped playing like two weeks after it came out. I'm so disappointed.</s>      Why? Shulk is a fun character.    I was always a Roy main in Melee so I am totes okay with giving Nintendo shekels so I can go back to playing my main in Sm4sh.      Ehh, it felt like they didn't bother to balance the characters. This is already apparent int Brawl, but very obvious in Smash 4.    I always post on ghost anyway, and I don't like to tout my contributions to the threads, but that sounds like a good idea to me.    They kinda update the game constantly with patches, so they're more balanced now than how they were at the start.    don't like to tout my contributions</span> Don't worry, we like your stuff. No need to be so modest.      Is Ghost down, I cant seem to get into it. Also your contributions are always appreciated, so feel free to post it wherever you want.     It was up a few minutes ago. It's been playing up a lot recently.    Well what's the new anime?    For me the old images archived are gone. Pretty frustrating since I wanted to retrieve some pictures that I've posted but deleted now.    Unhappy.     Thank you, but I prefer to keep it from getting to my head, I'm not really all that fond of attention either.  Also, the archive is in a bit of a mess right now, it's up and down all the time. Going back to any thread past a week or so results in broken images too.       Let's see, there's gakkou gurashi and another one...   How was the new episode?   The scene in your pic made me tear up pretty bad. Sweet acts of kindness can make me really weepy.    That manga was <s>cute</s> as fuck. I was <s>grinning</s> the whole time while reading it.    you will never run your hands through those drills</span>    Do you think she can play "The Real Folk Blues" on her sax?    maybe that's why Shuuichi can't focus   I liked it. a lot.   How does something like this even come to exist?  The animation is gorgeous. Clearly, it took some money to make.  What's it general audience? Did Oshii's name carry enough strength in that time to allow him such creative freedom?   It's a fucking piece of art. The like that does not come often.          Good luck finding anyone but the two of us who even know what you posted OP.   Filename, dude.    Angel's Egg gets mentioned a lot around here, actually. <s>Alternatively, we have a lot of Gong fans hanging around who can't help but share their enthusiasm.</s>    The 80's bubble economy produced some really beautiful animation.    Not nearly as unpopular as you think. I could name at least one super popular youtube fag who has done a video on Angel's Egg.  Probably one of the more popular "artsy" anime.       It is good but I felt the actual content was lacking.  Some vague symbolism for the ark? So what?  Not enough is really given to play with that idea. Just obvious suspects for the symbols of Jesus, The Virgin Mary, God, Satan, Sin, etc. Some pretty basic stuff.  Though to be completely fair I only saw it once and besides enjoying the spectacle immensely I didn't really care enough to look through all the clues.  Demolition D is supposed to do a review of this though. Might be good <s> 14 years from now </s>             I loved it, Amano is a fucking master too.  I really liked the atmosphere, it was kind of nightmare-ish, this and Akira's night segments are very close the the atmosphere and colors of my nightmares.  Cool shit.         Demolition D is supposed to do a review of this though.</span> Nobody cares.    Literally the cure for insomnia.   Well the OP might. If it was one of my favorite shows/films I would want to see a well done review breakdown of it    Did Oshii's name carry enough strength in that time to allow him such creative freedom?</span> Fuck no. Oshii did Angel's Egg way before he hit it big and has stated that it pretty much killed his career for several years. If you watch interviews where it comes up, you can tell he still has a lot of love for it, referring to it as (paraphrasing) a daughter that's unloved/unknown compared to stuff like GITS.   It's pretty interesting though that his other top-tier movies, Patlabor &amp; GITS, were according to him taken on just because he needed the money/work and ended up being some of his best. He also has a really laid-back sense of humor for someone who makes the kind of super serious movies that he does.       https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=BYL<wbr>ZGJb2HA8</wbr></span> [ ]  Here's the interview I pulled that from, it's worth watching if you're interested in his career and he has some really fucking funny stories, like how he and the chief animator of GITS would sneak out from work to go play Virtua Fighter and how he quit playing after a junior-high school kid beat him.      Man, I would really love one of these with Kon. thanks for posting.   It's almost as DEEP as Milky Holmes.  Some vague symbolism for the ark</span> Well, not really. Fedora-san's story recounts the biblical flood story up to a point. In the bible, the second dove comes back with an olive branch. In Angel's Egg, it doesn't come back and everyone turns into skellingtons waiting for Season 2. It seemed pretty straightforward to me that the point of the film is that religious ceremonies are just a pointless waste of time and effort.        Stop advertising your shitty channel here, dick sucker.     What's wrong with Demo D faggot    still shilling</span>  Get the fuck out.       has he ever confirmed posted on /a/?     I'm sure he browses it. He mentions it a couple times.  whatever you say       Yeah, all I could really get was that Oshii doesn't care much for christianity. Guy carrying a cross is the antagonist, the cross is only an instrument of senseless destruction etc. Just a depressing take on biblical themes overall.  Speaking of which in the GitS movie, didn't Oshii have the helicopters trying to eliminate the witnesses appear as angels in Kusanagi's damaged optics? Dude just isn't fond of christianity.  Anyways I really liked Angel's Egg, are there any other good anime with Amano designs like this?        Too deep for me, sure the art was good but fuck could I not get into it at all.   Damm, I always want to talk about this. Sadly, I just came back from work and I am fucking tired. Hope this thread survives until tomorrow.   Let's take a break from history and geopolitics.  Orimoto will change the way that shipping wars are fought!  Old thread:       I want to kill this fucking cunt  <s>he's already dead</s>    Reminder that Haruno is a loser who has nothing better to do than fuck with high school students  If Yukino was Raoh, who would Orimoto be  <span class="quote">&gt;5 seconds faster</span> Guess you win?   Good Irohasu~, everyone!   Reminder that Haruno was right and 8man betrays himself when he sacrifices himself for the sake of preserving the status quo.     IROHA OR DEATH R O H A  O R  D E A T H                  He realizes the reason he fell for her, and he hates himself for it now.   So did Orimoto realize she was walking into the Lion's den?  As a Yukinofag I apologize for my brethen's faggotry, have a yuri    So what the hell is Haruno's game?   Best case scenario is she's acting out a more twisted "love" for her sister than even Yukimom is by trying to control Yukino.  Worst case scenario is she's a jaded bitch who just wants to watch the world burn.      yfw 8man is actually the Joker</span> You have nothing to threaten me with... nothing to do with all your strength.     SORE ARU    studying actually matters and it is what everyone is focused on</span> We're talking about the Japanese system here. Studying is actually important in HS and less important in uni.     Truth. They work their asses off in high school to get into a good university where it's basically a four-year long booze-soaked fuckfest while they live out the adolescence they were deprived of.    four-year long booze-soaked fuckfest</span> No, not exactly right either. But they can take it easier.      the reason he fell for her</span>  What reason would that be? She's an insufferable cunt.      Only true ending   The snow had finally stopped falling. Behind a veil of ragged clouds, a full moon floated fat and white as a snowball. The stars shone cold and distant. As I made my way across the corridors, the school seemed an alien place, where every door and window had grown icy teeth, and all fields had vanished beneath a white blanket. The dressing rooms were behind the soccer field, a spacious room cluttered with showers and benches and lockers jammed full of shirts and shorts. I had always found them uncomfortably crowded. Not tonight. The chill was palpable.  “Winter,” I said. The word made a white mist in the air. Then something slammed me in the chest between the ribs, hard as an androphobe's fist. It drove the breath from me and sent me lurching backwards. What… Who… A football was sunk almost to the stitching in my chest. No. No, that was how my sister died.  He stood in a pool of shadow by a locker, fit, broad-shouldered, clutching another ball in goalie gloves. “Hayama?” My classmate set the ball down. "This pains me, Hikigaya. You do not deserve to die alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad causes… but you were threatening to undo all her mother’s good work, to reconcile Haruno and Yukino-chan, bind flags to your little main girl, unite the Service Club under genuineness. So…”  “I am sorry.” Hayama wrung his hands. “You are suffering, I know, yet here I stand going on like some fucking cunt. Time to make an end to it.” The soccer captain pursed his lips and gave a little whistle. I was cold as ice, and every labored breath sent a fresh stab of pain through me. I glimpsed movement, heard the clacking sound of steps on stone. A child emerged, a pale girl in a pink apron, no more than sixteen or seventeen. Another rose up from the showers. The girl who had spoonfed me before was there as well. They were all around him, half a dozen of them, white-faced children with amber eyes, mostly girls. And in their hands, the daggers.                   She's amusing. Laughter is one of the few genuine emotions.    Made for each other.    She's nice to everyone  8man doesn't even SPEAK a lot to classmates, so he feel something special with Kaori.   In reality, Kaori just see him as random classmate she doesn't particularly get attached to.  Like, that's the entire point of nice girl rant. Cruelty born of kindness.          No this time.    DA-YO-NE.   does Zaimokuza appear at all during volume 11? Or has the war for Hachiman become too serious for everyone's favourite chuuni novel author to be mentioned?  Yuckyno a shit. A SHIT.  Iroha a best. A BEST.  The soccer competition seemed pretty heated. I didn't pay too much attention to sports in general, but it was clear the match for prefectural champion was probably going to go down to the wire.   It was all part of that youth that I despised so much. These pointless battles for a trophy that would end up drowning in dust within a few years, lost in memory to anyone who cared. Then why was I here? Only because of Isshiki's request.  "This is a formal request by the student council to the Service Club! Let's cheer on Sobu High at the championship!"  Yukinoshita was going to decline, but Hiratsuka was in the room and thought it was a good idea. So here we all were, sitting in the front stands of the local soccer pitch. Hayama and his team seemed in top form, but even they were struggling against the other school, the defending champions. Yukinoshita noticed me rubbing my hands together and handed me a thermos. Max Coffee. My savior.  "Thanks, Yukinoshita." She merely nodded, her eyes focused on the game. Yuigahama to my left was doing the same, cheering loudly whenever it looked like we were making an approach, and screaming when we were on the defense. I couldn't ever see myself this worked up about a sport I wasn't even participating in, so I was content simply to watch in silence. Isshiki was with the student council's official cheering section, which seemed appropriate enough.            It seems like after the cooking event, things get really heavily focused on just the service club and a few peripheral characters like Haruno, Sensei, and Komachi.    <span class="quote">&gt;Yukino sits in the clubroom in her chair, chained </span> Yui has a big kitchen knife in her Hand</span> Yukino tries to scream</span> Yui gives her a fist into her mouth, pulls Yukinos tongue out, and cuts it off</span> Yukino cries but can't make sounds</span> Yui continues pulling out Yukino eyes one by one </span> Then takes out her teeth one by one</span> Yukino is still alive and has a seizure</span> Yui stucks her knife into Yukinos heart and takes it out</span> She puts it in the dustbin</span> 8man comes back from the toilet</span> Sees Yukino face without eyes, tongue and teeth and pukes</span> Yui comes nearer</span> "Hikki, something really bad happened.

Oh, this will cheer you up!"</span> Yui cuts off Yukinos face and puts it in hers</span> "Am I genuine enough for you now, Hikki?"</span> 8man tries to run</span> Gets smashed against the wall and forcekissed and tastes the blood in Yuis mouth and the rest of Yukinos eyes and her heart</span> "I want more of you Hikki!"</span> Yui stabs him in his heart too and takes his heart out</span> Eats his heart infront of him</span> "Look, Hikki. You will live within me now, ahahah"</span>                           A whistle, and everyone in the crowd oohed. Penalty kicks. I took a drink of my steaming coffee and passed it over to Yuigahama, who took it gratefully and sipped. I could hear a voice just slightly louder than the rest.  "HAYATO! YOU CAN DO IT!" Miura was screaming at the top of her lungs at the front of the cheering section, with all the rest of the class group cheering with her. I didn't see how central Hayama was to any of it, since he only had to kick 1 out of 5 balls. Only a 20% maximum contribution to the effort.  A whistle. First round, both in. Second round, both in. Third round, the other school missed. The crowd went absolutely nuts until the fourth, at which our school missed. Tied at 3 penalties each, it all came down to the very last kick. Hayato was up and he made his kick effortlessly, the enemy goalie completely misplaying and jumping the wrong way. Then it was the final ball...  Well, of course it would be a miss. The crowd roared, and Hayama was being carried to the podium. He lifted the trophy and I gave a small smile. There, that was my contribution to team spirit. He walked down the sideline, raising the trophy and allowing people to touch the trophy. Everyone was standing up and reaching over the banisters, trying to lay a finger on the prefectural championship trophy. He paused at Miura a bit, and gave her a small smile.  Then he got to our group. He looked at Yukinoshita, then gently placed the trophy on her lap.  At that moment, all the smiles died.              Brothers?  <s>How's the war? Keep killing each other. I'll be here defending my post</s>    Looks like Yui is trying to be the worst girl this volume.  <span class="quote">&gt;Iroha wins</span> Yuifags and Yukinofags go into denial and shitpost even harder</span>  You know, I'm not even surprised anymore.      After we got off the ride, Yukinoshita was staggering on her feet so she was resting on the bench that was immediately outside the exit.</span>  When I made it back to the bench, Yukinoshita seemed to have bought some kind of thin oblong plastic pouch when I wasn’t around and was putting it away in her bag. After she noticed me, she closed her bag and placed it on her lap.</span>  Yep she bought the picture.       Why does he wear the Bola tie? is he a western fan?     incredible samefag, friend     Better than Cuckino     Probably Haruno said it looked good on him once.     He's just that alpha.    Here, but i already reach enlightment and doesnt want to participate in such trivialities and stare at the sisterly genuine love instead.    incredible mad, friend.    Now that's alpha    Most honest girl is worst girl? Laughs all around, gentlemen.  She even declared giving him chocolate this valentines.      ow the edge    Raoh did nothing wrong.    SO FUCKING CUTE    Iroha is cuter   YU MI KO     A SH IT      No, it's actually stupider than that. They're trying to paint her getting actual character development as making her a horrible person. My guess is it's (mostly) the same faggots who sperged out about how cold and distant Yukino was between the StuCo election arc and Genuine.   Why does Hikki dream of lolis?   this delusional</span> Im not even mcmad    Deep down i know Iroha will lose, but she's by far the best gril   HAAHH?!    Don't bully Yumiko.    ahn?

This came so much sooner than I expected that it has me a bit worried. I suspected there to be some big development involving 8man finally opening himself to romance, but instead he's just casually admitting he likes her out of nowhere.  On the other hand, maybe Iroha's getting the Hitagi treatment where the romance mostly takes place offscreen.     I'll fucking kill you.    So it'll end like Onani Master?

Iroha's actually pretty shy when it comes to genuine flirting. Her dialogue slows down to reflect her rising arousal levels as she talks to 8man about the chocolate.     yes, thank you anon.    <span class="quote">&gt;Irohafags insist that 8man is interested in her</span> not once has he ever looked or desired her goodies</span>   I always wondered why she always went on and on about his eyes.

I've heard 8man referred himself once as a bear, but the kanji used was panda.    Told Hachiman Yukino isn't genuine</span> Wonder if genuine things exist</span> Haruno want Hachiman but Hachiman is so Yukinosexual to not realize it.      She's obsessed with him anon. That's why she wants to either take it all or leave at once    No, he got temporarily mesmerized by her skirt while playing table tennis on their date in 10.5 <s>Unfortunately for her he wasn't paying that much attention because she still lost miserably</s>  The more damning evidence is that 8man hasn't made any efforts to get to know Iroha better like he has with the other two girls.      In the closet, or she loves them both. Yui's a lot less open about her feelings than the club seems to realize.    have you actually studied in japan? there might be less reading and memorizing stuff but they actually have plenty of projects and activities to keep them busy.    It started off just as her playing playful like usual, as seen in the anime. Her attitude shifts when 8man says he liked it though.     These both always make me laugh, god dammit. Thank you, anons.     They have less reading and memorizing? I was under the impression they have significantly more arbitrary memorization than places like the US.    Something like this, then?  <s>I'm not sure what gets bigger when I see this. My boner at her expression, or my heartboner at thinking of the aftercare that comes next.</s>      Yukino is the most non-genuine girl in this show.

Yukino shouldn't be protected,  she need to learn to solve her own shit.     he's trying to outsly her i see    Yeah I meant that part as an agreement with the anon I quoted, but providing a more concrete basis for his claim.     I've been waffling back and forth for some time on Haruno's motivations between "benevolent onee-san looking out for her sister" and "psychotic monster hell bent on exposing genuine as a lie because she doesn't believe in it".  I guess what I think now is that due to past issues they've gone through, she's constructed an elaborate image of Yukino in her mind since childhood. That of a helpless little girl who does nothing for herself but stand behind someone stronger than her to show her the way. That image is of course not inaccurate, but Haruno isn't necessarily able to see how much Yukino may have changed since then because Haruno needs herself to see Yukino that way.  When Hachiman started to really become important to Yukino, some of Yukino's old demons resurfaced alongside it. Haruno instantly spotted it and went on the attack. Note in the first season, during the culture festival, Yukino asks Haruno to help them perform while Hachiman looks for Sagami. Haruno refuses at first but Yukino stands up to her and Haruno is honestly impressed. She tells Yukino she has changed, but Yukino says to the effect that she had already been that kind of person, Haruno just couldn't see it in seventeen years.         I agree, I was just saying Yui doesn't have that problem.   <span class="quote">&gt;look down and frown</span>  Is this like her finishing move or something?    Something that more sinister than trust is expectation. That was what makes Yukino is not genuine because she place expectation toward 8man just like her mother place expectation to her.    BDs never</span>   sorry for being this guy but where can i read the volumes  Oh god fucking damn it, look at what happened. I knew I should have taken it easy, look at all the SHIT that cam out of my ASS.   Even Feel tried telling us about just how much she changed in his eyes. That nigga can't stop admiring her anymore and he shot himself in the foot pretty hard on that younger girl / komachi conversation in the club. Also some anons said that he couldn't stop looking at her in that scene in the novels, but we don't know that yet.      NEVER FORGOTTEN!    You should call a plumber.   Am I the only person who didn't see the love triangle coming?     How come I'm such a hopeless Yukinofag? I'm more of a dog person tbh    MC + 2 main girls love triangle in an LN</span>  WOAH O A H         Some people just can't help it, Anon.    I've always preferred cats myself, but I'd rather die than abandon this precious angel.    You're a dog person and you're into dogshit. Why the confusion?   <span class="quote">&gt;Last illustration of volume</span>     Because we dog lovers are fast to recognize the genuine. Just like Yui recognizes the thing Yukino and 8man have for each other.    I know how you feel. I'm usually more into characters with actual personalities, but I can't help but love Yukino!    They are on a date. What?    Dogs aren't genuine though. Pack mentality is programmed into the brains. Cats on the other hand only do what they want. If they like you then it's because they like you, not because you're the pack leader.    I fucking love you, anon.    Your passive aggressiveness isn't welcome here.   I was expecting something from these 2, in this volume   nigguh please, cats sometimes act tsundere as if it were some sort of instinctive behavior while dogs are easy as hell to read    This bitch didn't even make chocolate or teach anyone to make anything, why did Iroha invite her? All she did was act like a bitch.   Yukino won  The Iroha faggots were going overboard with the spoon scene, but 2ch says it's 8man shooting Iroha down.   A shit. A SHIT.    I was quite shocked when I read those spoilers too, because we've never seen 8man deliberately flirting with anyone like that before. I kept trying to find excuses and stuff like that to downplay that quick exchange of words and thoughts but I couldn't find any reasonable one. That's a huge flag between both of them, if anything. But it worries me that Watari would write something like that when the (still) obvious outcome is Yukino and the main focus is still Yukino.  Basically I don't know what to think of it.        She's cute but no, she hasn't won yet.    stay mad   Watari didn't mention anything about volume 12 being the final volume in his afterword.  How would you feel if volume 12 is in fact not the final volume?     1 more year of suffering.    Kill myself    calling out autist trio for friendzoning each other</span> the only person pushing 8man to take action</span>  Yeah, what a cuntbag. In other news, Iroha has no feelings for 8man.       That only means I'll be stuck with this shitty general for a longer time.    Fuck off    Got a link for that?    What does the text say other than that talk about the pleasure of being cummed inside?    I'm glad it isn't. It would probably feel rushed to solve everything in one volume when we still don't know even what the fuck is Yukino's problem.      General dies with anime, there will be occasional LN thread but that's only when Spyro descend from heaven.    She was invited because "Haru-san-senpai desu~" is fucking adorable from both Iroha and Haruno.    If there's a volume 13 Iroha wins, since that's going to be her birthday.     Gets called to help students make chocolate</span> Does nothing but stand to the side with Hayato and make the Service Club act all awkard</span> 10/10 would ask alumni for help again.       vol 12 he ends up with winner winner chicken dinner vol 13 he drops all contact with butthurt losers the rest is all about him learning how to be a boyfriend Komachi crashing their dates and other lovey dovey shenanigans.       What does Iroha gains from being friends with Haruno?    Why did people think it is the final volume?    This girl needs to die    http://hello.2ch.net/test/read.cgi/<wbr>anichara2/1435023502/l50</wbr>    Nothing, she's terrified of Haruno too.    You tell me, Satan    She knows he likes pretty onee-sans. And if they're on good terms with eachother she'll let 8man fuck her everyother weekend and have threesomes on his/her birthday, christmas, and valentines.     It was a montage. I'm sure Haruno and Hayama didn't just stand there the whole time.    http://hello.2ch.net/test/read.cgi<wbr>/anichara2/1435023502/l50</wbr></span>  trust me that's fake. I've read all the novel and nothing news about iroha after chapter 4 6-7-8 is haruno vs yukino, sleep over, aquarium date, Yui fullfil her baking request by giving Yukino a edible bag of cookies. 9 is about the club, yui confess, yukino request ....      Aye, probably FEEL skipping around HARD    What baking request?    They're setting up the college edition of the Service club with Haruno and Iroha.    nothing news about iroha after chapter 4</span>  Iroha is a supporting character. Good.      Yui fullfil her baking request by giving Yukino a edible bag of cookies.</span>  You mean giving 8man right?      Yui request Yukino teach her how to bake (ss1)  she already win LOL ( i hope so)  She did give him in chap 6? and it's poison, 8 man nearly puke. He ask her if she use mirco wave to bake this shit.... Then Cuckinoshita give him a leftover bag.         What's fake? The spoon scene or Hachiman turning her down?    trust me that's fake. I've read all the novel</span>  I don't believe you.     Where the fuck is Spyro? How can he be absent at a time like this?    He seemed pretty worn out last time I saw him on these threads.  He's probably crashing.       LOL</span>  Kill yourself!      After the chocolate event, it's all about the Club, komachi high school test etc.... Not sure if Hachiman turn her down offscreen though.      Actually now that I remember he said he had to go on travel.      Sleeping, translating, avoiding shitposting. Usual Spyro things.   Now that's alpha.   LOL</span> i</span> ... and used after a period for a total of four dots (two times the error)</span> Cuckinoshita</span> Am I Haruno? Why am I hanging around high schoolers?          Probably killed himself because Yukino didn't win.   Were there yahari thread in the hiatus between S2 and S2?   I fucking hate how they did the last scene in volume 10. They made it look like 8man was more averse than he really was. In the LN they were being playful, Haruno offered some advice and 8man took it seriously. In the anime he looks like he's just getting mad and wants to leave.    Why?    Kill yourself.    Are you saying the spoiler is fake or the claim that 8man is "shooting Iroha down" is fake?  Because pic related is pretty damn conclusive in Iroha's favor and it comes with artwork.   It's not surprising. Romance not involving the club isn't directly relevant to the story. If Iroha does hook up with 8man it would be Monogatari all over again.         No because there's no time between S2 and S2     LOL </span> .....</span> cuck</span> Kill yourself        Is it that guy with the biased as fuck translations? I hope he never comes back    i dont know LOL   Irohasu~  In all seriousness, my heart goes out to all Irohafags.  Because it is still very, very clear that Yukino is going to win at this point.     the claim that 8man is "shooting Iroha down" is fake</span>  She dont even appear since then.      :3    Is it that guy with the biased as fuck translations?</span> Stop regurgitating shit  If Spyro stopped you better say goodbye to good LN translation       Kill yourself, autist LOL    LOL</span>    LOL</span>  Fuck off!     YAHALLO   Who trusts this LOL translator?    We've known about the illustration since before episode 12 aired. And nothing's "pretty damn conclusive" when the translation that Irohafags have been screaming about was posted with no japanese text or anything else to reference it against.    Irohasu~    What's your point? If 8man is flirting with Iroha for her last interaction in 11, then that means it'll be the status quo between them in 12.  The scene is, very clearly, not a rejection. At least if you can read it.     neat.   Except he translated chapter 2 of 10.5 completely intact. Sometimes I wonder why he still managed to put up with you fags.    <span class="quote">&gt;2 girls chasing after MC for 10 volumes</span> new girl chases him for 2 volumes and takes him away</span>  Where are the austistic Yuckynofags and dumb Yuifags now?      How much for the shipping?    Yukinofags are all the same, honestly. Lying shitbags with no lives just wanting to hurt others. He's biased as shit he can die for all I care.    implying he's an Irohafag</span> I'm sure he's probably talking about Yui's 'suki nano' translation.

Nice falseflagging faggot    Not shitposting like the Irohafags do every thread.     1000 yen I think     I'd go read the actual chapter on kyakka instead of a faked epub chuned out by a desperate Irohafag.    with no japanese text</span> Here, I'll even highlight it for you. You can fuck right off if you think I'll typeset almost 2 pages worth of text just to humor you.     I wonder if that means mines is shipped as well.    Reject what? It's just like the Anime, FEEL cut off Hachiman inner thought and Iroha 2nd question.  That's all, next day Yukinon apologize Yui and 8man for Yukimom event.     攻  　　　　　　　 │  　いろはす　│　ゆい  　　　　　　　 │  策士───┼───頭使わない  　　　　　　　 │  　ゆきのん　│　サキ  　　　　　　　 │  　　　　　　　 受   か？             I can buy the kindle edition, can't I? It would be downloaded in no time and it's cheap.     bothering to rank Saki</span> I'm impressed     yukino on the schemer side</span> You fucking what    I just want Saki to be happy.  Hachiman just needs to explain what exactly he means by 'genuine'. Obviously the girls don't know. I mean Yukino even asked him and he didn't answer.  I suggest he convey it with an interpretative dance.     You forgot she could manipulate people to do things for her without lifting a finger?    I'm referring to 's claim that 8man "shot Iroha down", which would mean a rejection.  8man answers her second question positively in the spoiler.      You can't honestly expect everyone to take a spoiler at face value when there's no hard evidence to back it up. Until either Spyro chimes in as a trusted authority or someone transcribes the text that corresponds to the passage about the spoon so people who can't read moon can compare it, you're going to have to suck it up and deal with skepticism.    She could but doesn't do it. Or maybe she's so good we don't even notice it.     You anti-Irohafags are the true cancer of the treads    You Irohafags are the true cancer of the threads</span>  FTFY      waaaah, stop raining on our parade with your logic</span>    Reminder: the "genuine thing" 8man isn't remotely complicated.  His whole monologue about wanting to understand but not be understood and "sour grapes" is nothing but the monster of logic spewing sophistry in his struggle to grasp an inherently emotional ideal.  It isn't a specific relationship or type of relationship.  It isn't exclusive to either platonic or romantic love.  It is nothing more than being honest with the people you care about. Telling the truth even when it might hurt them, and trusting them to stay with you and work through whatever pain may come so your relationship comes out stronger in the end.            Irohafags don't insult other girls unlike Yukinofags and desperate Yuifags, and we love her enough to post enough about her a lot. You shitters complaining about it are the true cancer     If it isn't complicated why did Yukino ask him to clarify.  And why does he repeatedly state he doesn't know what it means.       Someone already has and if you can't be bothered to check the thread or the ones before, you can fuck off too.  Hell I'll throw you a bone. Here it is in Jap   「えいっ！」  「先輩、こういうの甘いの、お嫌いですか？」   「・・・・・嫌いじゃねぇけど」   「はぁ。別に味の感想聞いたわけじゃないんですけど」   「それでも、答えは変わらんな・・・・」   「・・・・そうですか」  「参考になりました。じゃ、ちょっと行ってきますね。葉山せんぱーい！」   「甘すぎだな・・・・・」   You can go find the eng TL in this thread and the last, etc. and compare and see that's the TL is correct.                       Fair enough, I'll wait. It would take a really audacious nip to scan 5 pages of fake LN with official art while lining up with both the anime and said art though.    It's already been confirmed.   Any antifags are the cancer of this thread, just ignore them they when they shitpost, although in this case it isn't shitposting, it''s just an Anon with doubts.       Why isn't she making any progress on her food?    Definitive proof that Yukino steals away 8man as he reluctantly dates Iroha.    Fuck off Yukinofag I'm not a cuck like you    That's exactly what I was talking about, now was that so hard?    You could've just read and looked for it in the pages leak, but why would you care since it seems you're too lazy to read them or can't even read jap.    posted a picture of a shit</span> accuse others of shitposting</span>  u wot nigga      Reminder that sensei wins if 8man does nothing      I'll be glad to see you guys gone once the anime ends      Tits too big for Yukino, can't save.     After she gave Yukinon the cookie bag. She confess about how she is a selfish girl, want everything.......then she tell them if everyone know what other is thinking, then things will not stay this way anymore, it'll change.  Hachiman just stay there and listen, he didnt speak a single word. Yui pull Yukino hand, and ask her what's her problem that's she hiding form those 2. Yukino said she dont know Yui said that's our answer Yui said if she wins she going to take everything, She want everything stay this way, unchange. Every one just say what they're thinking, no matter the consequence, everything wont change. Just like a sweet lie. Hachiman still hasnt said anything, Yui ask Yukinon if it's alright with her? Yukinon: I-I....... I think it's alrig---  Hachiman feel like that isnt like Yukino at all so he decline Yui method "Yukino problem she must solve that herself"  Then he begins his "Genuine and lies " talk, too long dont want trans. He dont want to lie to his IMPORTANT person, so that he want GENUINE, he want the TRUTH Yui said it's just like him and smile. He cry again (yeah cry after genuine talk again, and he feel embarrassed) After that Yui and Hachiman look at Yukino, waiting for an answer Yukino knows, take a deep breath and said she hasnt agree with anything, dont decide people feeling by yourself. Yui smile and nod "that's right". Yui and yukinon look at each other, smile. 8man thought these 2 are telepathy or something. After that is Yukino request. Scene end with a sunset and 8man wondering what genuine look like, we'll know about the request in Vol12.                    a shame that they won't animate the moment Iroha wins    What are your guys' interpretations of his last line? Is he saying she's too sweet after all? Is it "too sweet" with positive connotations? Is Watari leaving it intentionally vague?   比企谷いろは  一色八幡  Oh, I like these. Straight from another thread where people were saying that it was Hayama who got ignored.  http://hello.2ch.net/test/read.cgi/<wbr>anichara2/1434150709/</wbr>       Looking at that thread it might be how they're interpreting the part about the けど.    Yui said it's just like him and smile. He cry again</span> God damn it 8man.    I don't think Oregairu is popular enough for /a/ to have good threads in years from now.  Will there be LN threads, or do I have to go ahead and make a forum myself?     want everything</span> What is everything?  She want everything stay this way, unchange.</span> Everything being unchanged isn't what she truly wants. Is she trying to stop a romance between 8man and Yukino?  That scene is great character development 8man to Yui</span> Be genuine 8man to Yukino</span> Solve your own heart              Typeset anon here and I'm working on it.    people were saying that it was Hayama who got ignored.</span> When was that? When Haruno brought up his chocolates?     In a few years we're going to have White Album 2 come out. It's going to be blast with that.    You sure you didn't mean this thread? http://hello.2ch.net/test/read.cgi/<wbr>anichara2/1435023502/</wbr>     okay, now these are spoilers I can believe   Why did Orimoto's eyes look like this?   White Album 2</span> D-demo... genuine...     So more than the actual fucking book?    Have you done http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=50993569  Yet?  </wbr>    realized she got friend-zoned bc he gave her the star instead of the heart, which makes her want to try for the 8inches    Yes, normie. That's why you buy in bulk.    The thought of the 8er makes her moist. Isn't Orimoto kind of skanky? She is only interested in 8man after she realizes he is covered in bitches and is an edgelord.    pretty typical, yeah. There's cheaper shipping but good luck getting your fucking copy before August.  speaks the truth, buy moar and mitigate the cost of shipping per item.    Oh baby.   He cry again (yeah cry after genuine talk again, and he feel embarrassed)</span> Hahaha... Oh wow...     Crap, three long pages. I haven't, but I guess if there's a translation I'd do it. Please include SFX. Maybe use http://thejadednetwork.com/sfx/?    second biggest slut after Haruno. 8man has market value now, clearly, so she ditches the fags at her school and makes a play for the guy swarming in banging bitches.    He cry again (yeah cry after genuine talk again, and he feel embarrassed)</span> What a fucking pussy.    What do people meant by the "Iroha or death" anyway?   So literally nothing happens in volume 11?  The fuck. Its just continued circle jerking.      Every one just say what they're thinking, no matter the consequence, everything wont change. Just like a sweet lie.</span> I don't get it, why would it be a lie if they're all saying what they think?  Anyhow, what exactly did Yui confess? She just said a bunch of vague things.       Iroha Akubar, fgt   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127098827</span> How did I mess this up so badly? Disregard.  They just might be reading too much into it, like some have pointed out.</span> Overall it doesn't sound like a turn down at all.</span> Fixed        So Yui still being Yui after all.   She only know solve problem by keeping status quo that's why she reveal her own method to hear how both 8man and Yukino response to it. Basically she create situation where three of them try to open up their own mind about each other issue and how they look their situation.  Really In the end Yui is the nicest one of three member.         They're being ironic. Iroha's popularity is a symptom of the show going nowhere; people see an outlet for their intrigue in this new character.    8/8, got a giggle out of me    I did the TL but several of the SFX are not standard and I can't make heads or tails of them.    Is she nicer than Orimoto?     I figured he was going to break out the water works again after this scene started getting spoiled earlier today.  It's like the service club is a relationship that evolves through stages. There's the initial stage where they all misunderstood each other but got along nevertheless that lasted until the student council affair. Then there was all the tension as they realized they didn't really understand each other. That lasted until the first genuine talk. Then they started to try to understand but it still eluded them. Things got progressively worse until this scene, which is probably the last big turning point. Thus the note of optimism in the final chapter title, though it also may refer to Haruno and Yukino.       Threesome ending become more likely now.    Yes    If they're all saying what they think, thing will change, that's what she think. She want everyone keep acting like nothing happend.So that's why she said she want everything. She want Yukino tell her what's her problem      8man and Iroha flirting</span> Yui confirms Yukino is the cookie guy</span> 8man tells Yui to be herself</span> 8man tells Yukino she's not getting the main heroine rescue treatment</span>  Quite a lot happened. What I'm wondering is how 8man telling Yukino to figure her own shit out was really any different than when Yukino told him to solve his own problems. He might be getting manipulated by Haruno.          Cried again</span> Sasuga windows     OTP TOT PTO       Last time he cried her scored lots of potential ass, does it work again of is he hurting that end?     Yui confirms Yukino is the cookie guy</span> What? I thought 8man was the cookie guy.     Cookie man is actually Sable     Well according to anon's spoilers it seems like it has a definite positive effect.  I wonder if Iroha was secretly listening to this moment too.       If you have a Japanese IME it should be easier for you to search it in the SFX site. I think the site accepts romaji.  Sorry, but no SFX TLs makes my typesetting for me a living hell. Please and thank you.     Why are they so melodramatic?  https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-11/chapter-1/ As always doing God works  Based SPyro  </wbr>   at this point I'm not sure if posts like this are actually someone who believes shit like that, or if it's just someone trying to carry on the bit.    It's logical, the moisture of his tears made his eyes less disgusting. +1 charm if you may.    because meme drama    That's the part I don't understand. She wants to act as if nothing has happened, but also wants them to speak their minds out? If they speak their minds out, there's no way they'll just be able to pretend they didn't. So, if Yui doesn't want things to change, wouldn't she rather the other two not to say what's on their minds?       GOD EXISTS    The fire has grown out of control, it seems. What a delicious scene to read.      God he translates fast. I really have to hand it to him.  Although I think it'd be wise if he read the whole book before he began translating. Maybe he did and just blew through it blazingly fast.       She gave Yukino the bag of cookies didn't she?    Based Spyro    THANK YOU BASED SPYRO    Spyro-sama !    https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahar<wbr>i-light-novel/volume-11/chapter-1/</wbr></span> What the fuck  Based god         I've already read that chapter, that guy got it wrong.  Yui gave 8man the cookies, not Yukino.         CHURCH OF SPYRO RECONVENES YET AGAIN    Maybe he did and just blew through it blazingly fast.</span> Probably pissed of shitposters and impostor.     I just finished faping and now I see this. Based god     God exists and his name is Spyro    It's only part 1.  There's like 10 parts to a single chapter.      THE SKELTAL ARMY REJOICES     That is chap 6 , She gave 8 man the cookie and he's nearly puke. He said if she use the Viber cooker to bake it? And in chap 8 She gave yukinon to fulfill her request to Yukinon - Teach her how to bake.      How is he so fast what the fuck?    This makes me a happy skeleton.    Oh fuck I forgot it's already the 24th in Japan.    Nips already eat lunch now   <span class="quote">&gt; “You know what I mean……? Better chocolate than never, yeah?” Tobe said, being pointlessly dramatic. The three of them made triumphant looks and shot glances over at the girls… Mmm, I thought we were nearing spring, but it still feels like we’re in the middle of winter!</span>  But Miura’s reaction was far more callous and cold compared to their trite act.</span>  “…Ha?”</span>      I thought he was on travel until Friday.     Since Komachi would slyly give me chocolate every year, I didn’t hate Valentine’s Day all that much. </span> As a matter of fact, since I loved Komachi so much as her older brother, I was anxiously waiting for the day to come.</span>  What a fucking siscon.        It's a get out of jail free card. But you can only use it so many times. Each time the effect is a little bit less.     She wants to act as if nothing has happened, but also wants them to speak their minds out?</span> If they speak their minds out, there's no way they'll just be able to pretend they didn't.</span> That was how she thought and she know she is selfish and wrong. That's why she reveal it to 8man and Yukino to heard how they response to it.Because even she telling herself she is fine with their current situation. she knew it willnot same to other two. She wants three share their own thought and choose what kind relationship they actually wants and How they makes it happen.       That makes sense. Surprisingly cunning from the girl with the 'normal brain'.     He's omnipresent    Yui</span> Normal brain</span>    I still chuckle every time 8man calls Oouka a virgin.   Spyro leaves Friday and I remember hom typing that he wanted to at least translate some of the volume before he left. I guess he did get his copy early, afterall.    Yui is actually clever when it comes to normalfag things, and seeing as 8man and Yukino began to distance away from being reclusive loser, it's a good chance to strike them and bring them out of their half-open shell.    Out of the 14 sfx I know 13 of them. I managed to get the last one now because the author combined two at the same time, I finally realized.  If you'll do it I'll post it.      But what's the point to it? I mean, correct me if I'm wrong but what you're saying is the following: "Yui wants them all to speak what they think, and then pretend they never said anything."  Is that correct? Because that doesn't make much sense, and is actually rather counter-productive. Why would you want to tell others what you think (and hear what they think) just to pretend nothing happened? If you wanted to pretends nothing happened, why simply not keep things a secret?  Or are you saying she told 8man and Yukino of that silly idea, just so that they would speak their minds out regardless of what they did afterwards?            She's a misunderstood genuis.    "Yui wants them all to speak what they think, and then pretend they never said anything."</span> No, I think Yui want them to ignore it if they want to and go back to the oh-so-comfortable status quo.  Essentially she challenged them. Because she know they hate lies.        Not the one you are responding to, but I think what she told them was how she really felt, knowing it would lead them doing the same. And that communication would help them find a way. Yui's always about communicating. Just like the first genuine talk. She's like "Hikki you're finally going to talk to us".   She's always been the bridge between the other two. And she does it again here.      <span class="quote">&gt;God, I’m not going to make it!”</span> “It’s okay, you still have time! Just keep going! Don’t give up!”</span> I casually looked over and a caste of girls sitting at different seats, either the second or third group from the top, was knitting some kind of muffler or sweater. It’s almost like I was listening to a conversation between a light novelist and his editor. Look, normally, you’re not going to make it. It’s almost Valentine’s Day and your progress is only at about ten percent. Rather than putting effort into making it on time for the deadline, it’d be more productive and realistic to try to extend it instead!</span>  Poor Watarin      8MAN = PAN-SAN YUKINO = GENUINE   YUKINO 8BOWL FUCKING CONFIRMED <s>FUCKING CONFIRMED</s> <s>GET HYPE</s>        Because she want to help yukino with that's method. And 8man againt it     the bitch winning the 8bowl</span> Why would you do this Watari      Ah, so Yui is going against what she wants? Yui wants things to stay the same. She wants everyone to ignore their issues and pretend they aren't there But, because she knows 8man and Yukino want the genuine, she told them how she felt to bait them into speaking. Is that how it is?        Nigga why you wasting time shitposting when Based Spyro has granted us manna from heaven?    Yes      Damn sly bitch      Because he isn't a hack-iroha-faggot like you     Not him but I read Spyro's manna in like 2 minutes.  So waiting for the next one.       It doesn't take 5 minutes to read what he translated so far   Patiently waiting for translations.   Bruh, that's like a 2 minutes read.    But there’s also the saying: “If winter comes, can spring be far behind?”</span>  Haruno end incoming.      he thinks I like the lesser of two bitches</span>    No she gave the cookies to 8man in front of Yukino in chapter 8, like I said I read the whole chapter in moon.  I'm guessing you got this idea from reading the chink's summary because that guy got it wrong as well.      How is he not when he made Iroha on purpose?   What was all that shit about Yui and Yukino not being friends earlier?  Anime ep 12 = chapter 5   Can you make a summary of all the relevant things that happened in this volume?    better chocoLATE than never</span> well done, spyro hopefully commiefaggots taking notes      She's a plot device.    Sure, I'll work on it. Might take a while, but I think I can finish before the next episode airs.   Well you know the problem that plagues the service club isn't gone just because Hachiman made another tearful speech about genuine that moved them.  And I don't think what Yui said regarding her feelings was a lie. She said it knowing it would be rejected and lead to Hachiman and Yukino talking through things, but it was sincere all the same.  So the fact remains that romance will kill the service club. Or at least Hachiman/Yukino romance will. Barring more character development from Yui of course.       In the form of a love interest.    Okay. Only people who love Yui will like it, it is very Yui heavy and sorta out of character.  http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=manga&amp;illust_id=50993569 Text in () are instructions or comments not meant to be on the comic  Page 1 Panel 3 sfx *creak*  Panel 6 Okay, it'll be sunday.

He'd make a great ally in changing the world.    So the fact remains that romance will kill the service club. Or at least Hachiman/Yukino romance will. Barring more character development from Yui of course.</span> Yui never really specified that 8man and Yukino going out would make her leave the club. Perhaps, she's just assuming things if they all start getting closer (especially considering how complicated 8man and Yukino can be, due to their issues), or that Yukino may just drift away if she (Yui) and 8man become a couple.      Oy, what the actual fuck it this shit. This isn't funny you nigger.

Daily reminder : Best Friend forever, Just like Watari and Eguchi Takuya Saika will win in Vol12, Yui+Yuki yuri, Iroha NTR 8man</span>    Yukino is a side character and lacks popular support. The best she can hope for is winning the Hayama or Yuibowl.   If Yui and Yukino ever duel it out they should have contests on how better to please the 8. That is the plot of a doujin I have in my head if I could draw.   Quit you're bitching, you won the series a year after he left. I am a Tigers fan.      Yukino</span> side character</span> What.      side character</span> is ranked #1</span> What?

Everything has been shit since that clown came around.          What is Yui doing to Yukino in this pic?

He’s asking whether or not the death and decay that come at the end of something always mean that a rebirth is around the corner.</span> He’s hoping that’s true, because he can feel himself decaying.</span> Yukino - death and decay</span> Haruno - rebirth</span>  GET READY           Yui* things    Yukino is #1 on the LN readers ranking though.    here, breathe in some cyanide gas</span> thank you Yui</span>    <span class="quote">&gt;8man telling Yukino to solve her own problems</span> Thank Yeezus. No white knighting, no save a ho-ing.    Who was it then ?    2ch, which is pretty much the only ranking that actually matters.</span>    Even as an Irohafag, I suspect he's going to reverse his position soon.  No matter how I look at it he seems to just be doing the same thing Yukino did prior to the GENUINE speech, but maybe a translation will give us more context.       Dank Yuri</span>    Yamato. The other two guys are made to sound like violent douchebags, while he gets to enjoy a slight bump to his reputation as a player. Of course he's the rumormonger. He couldn't help but use it as a chance to make his stock rise.    Too bad the volume ends with them promising to solve Yukino's problems for her.    For LNs the Kono Ranobe wa Sugoi is the ranking that matters the most, though.  Rankings in 2ch are as good as rankings in Reddit or 4chan for Western things.      He's telling Yui    He thinks some ranking where first place doesn't even have more than 400 votes matters</span>  what a cuck       Haruno moved into Yukino's home, called Yukino out for having no self.</span>  Sleep over at Yui's home, Yui's mom a qt. 8man nicknamed her Gahamama.</span>  Girls talk, Yui ask Yukino for a date.</span>  Threesome date at aquarium.</span>  Yui told 8man she is not a nice girl, Yukino admitted she has dependency issue. </span>  After the date Yui gave 8man a bag of cookies, then this  happen.</span>              Can't wait for Miura end out of nowhere.  even after the volume end the valentine day hasn't over yet. Guess we have to wait for another volume to see whether the Iroha ship sinks or not. (If she wont try to do anything before the end of the day then no matter what happen later her ship sure will sink like the TItanic)   move aside plebs, best gril coming through    Basically He telling Yui to be herself.

Who is best girl?</span>  I am unsure but as far as Marriage goes I do believe Suu has what is probably the best answer.

You just posted the two best girls. What more can I add?   Am I the only person upset that Papi won't be a DFC in the anime? She went from an A to a small B in the few screenshots I've seen  Rachnee, murderfish, Polt and MON full moon episode when?   I am also upset by this. Too many titty monsters in the series as it is, why add another?    papi</span> good </span> Boy, learn your place!     Too bad Suu can't do fetish shit   All that great taste is hard to handle, 2 best girls   No it annoyed me too, now there's no girl filling the flat niche       Too many titty monsters</span>      Did you deliberately reverse the order of the names in relation to their positions in the picture? This is triggering my autism hard.    Suu is first if you look at it right to left like you would read manga.    That makes sense. They come across as labels when they're above the characters like that though.    Too bad Suu can't do fetish shit</span> Why can't she?    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-Ua<wbr>Z6U1YO1A</wbr></span> [ ]  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127044797</span> This is the correct answer, of course. MC gonna end up with ms Smith and the final message of the anime will be that racemixing is bad.     Kinda hard for a slime to do watersports without killing herself.     Water&gt;Bird&gt;Snake&gt;everyone else    That isn't how slimes work.  That being said, Suu doesn't follow traditional (aka correct) slime design, so who knows.      Deathlady above all though    Who    Exactly.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127044797</span> The only correct answer in this thread.    suu she can be anything you want  want her to be a 200cm futa onee-amazon? you got it. want her to be an overweight mass that sits on your face? you got it. want a loli? you got it. want her to be a caring mother with huge tits? you got it. want someone to fuck every possible oriface you have, at the same time? you got it nigga.  suu is life, love and olev all in one.  suu wins             Can you train Suu to perform non-fatal unbirth?    What is this one doing anyway ?   I never see her anymore.   Also is it ever explained where she comes from and did Manako ever find out that she was deceived by her ?         I rest my case.      MC keeps getting various percentages of his total body submerged in her and doesn't die, so obviously she could do that too.   Are you brain damaged?       Question: <s>What happened to the MGG threads?</s>    went to /jp/. They're complete shit.     No really, you are.  Remove water from Suu, what happens.        I wasn't aware there were MGG threads.       They were banned from here, and moved to /jp/. Thank God.   ＨＯＲＳＥ ＰＵＳＳＹ   What's a mgg thread?    According to historical evidence in MonMusu, her total mass just keeps decreasing. Technically as long as one atom of her remains, she'll be able to (eventually) recover.  Also, pissing on her would just increase her dilution. Urine is still water, her body would filter the unneeded bits out. Also, the canon hentai shows that she can absorb semen in its entirety, so obviously she can feed on more than just H2O.       It's canon-proof Suu can't into Watersports.     canon hentai?    secondaries</span>    Canon hentai</span> I need links for research purposes.     Monster Girl General. You really don't want to go there, that way lies madness   <br/>   Don't dehydrate</span> Watersports</span> I think these are opposites...      source or this 'canon' hentai is full of shit     True, BUT the other problem is that is Suu starts pissing, she tends to get weird. Same thing if she gets "funny" stuff into her, such as poison or minerals.     Drinking your own urine can allow you to survive for an additional few days (depending on environment) in a dehydration situation (aka no access to actual water).  So yes, watersports can foster continued hydration to a degree. Especially for Suu, who would actually absorb all the urine (as opposed to 3DPD, which wastes 99% of it).    I'm not going to spoonfeed your retarded ass.            I assume they're talking about the original one shots crabman did before Monster Musume. One of which featured a slime.     Depends on the type.  Omorashi/Desperation vs getting pissed on.       Satan is the father of lies, though.    That involves the loss of only a fraction of her total body mass, she wouldn't die from that (no matter how far you took it within the boundaries of the fetish).   <span class="quote">&gt;Reminder Ms. Smith is Best Girl.</span>   But Satan actually gets shit done.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127047690</span> *smacks head*</span>    What happened to generals?</span> You got all the dreadfulness you'd expect from any general.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127047690</span> *smacks head*</span>  Sorry, but gaiaonline is that way ^     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127047777</span> Oh shit!    fffffffffffffffffffffffffff    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127047777</span> <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127047690</span> This level of newfaggotry</span>     Quick, you're tasked with making a good, non-erotic video game based on the Monster Musume universe, and can only use monsters that Crabman has designed.

I can't see her being more than 400lbs if she's only 7'5"     Maybe she can control density like Suika from Touhou.     Human density sounds too light after she fastball pitches a vending machine.

Close one eye and walk across your room. Depth perception only becomes a problem up close.    Which chapters do you hope get adapted in the anime? <s>I'm going for chapter 10 just because Suu licks Papi's bellybutton.</s>    all    Since a few years ago? Are you not following anime trends or something?     Papi's egg-laying chapter is the one I'm most looking forward to.    She doesn't have depth perception.    Really, she's walking into stuff anyway because she has the hat pulled down and she's looking at her feet.    Are you not following anime trends or something?</span> I'm not. I tend to look back rather than forward.     Yes, hence depth perception isn't a thing    i meant issue     Does Manako have a host family or is she just camping out somewhere ?

Suu and doppel.    It's safe to assume their all the same age except for suu and rachnera    I think Miia is actually: ミーア    ミイアとラクネラは何歳ですか</span> ill tweet this at him     I meant they're</span> auto correct     Should be fine    Yeah, you're right I fucked up     A few weeks and since before time.   Anybody here a legs guy? Which legs do you like?    You know Rachneras got some serious skill when she can sexually mind break a goddamn succubus.     Maybe it's the legs?     Lala's    I feel like they'll skip that one.    It'll be an ecchi anime Why wouldn't they do that?     That's obvious, not even up for debate.    Papi is somewhat of a loli. That scene is heavily ecchi. Do the math.     I fail to see the issue.    I'm partial to the second leg from the left    It is anime. Ring any bells now? implying we still get real lewd lolis on TV anime</span>      I have to wonder what Subway rides are like for her.     But she's "of age" The manga says so     But she doesn't look of age. Therefore, no-go for anime.     missing the quotation marks</span> I was being sarcastic     Why is it okay for manga but not for anime?    manga makes it harder for children to see it think like playboys and American television     Because that's how it is for years now. Above a level that can be shrugged off, fanservice of lolis becomes cut out or toned down to worthless crap.    those abs </span> that horn </span> that skin tone </span> those ears </span> those legs</span>        <s>I want to lick it all</s>    Just outside, or inside as well?    <s>ALL</s>      L-Lewd!

Though Papi seems to be older in the anime too, so it might work, but not on TV. Still the usual method is that girls like her just getting their lewder scenes cut out.       Maria.....yer killin' me here.     Nah she was let out but wants to come back    Mindbreaks a succubus</span> God damn, Rachnee     She's not older, her white meat is bigger.

Was he raped?   stop sexualising my ecchi girls</span>    yes    nothing better    Probably not because when he meets Rachnea it is stated he's still a virgin. The better question is how the hell does Centorea sleep without back problems    Note the garbage can filled with kleenex. Slicking. Slicking everywhere    I think this guy needs to not read any eechi mangas. Girls getting touched and then slapping the toucher is half the fucking content.    Who did for Cerea?

More chapters will be released and translated eventually. Discussion will come.    The anime will only bring bad things.  It always happens. Mangafags will shit talk animefags since they are newfags and ask dumb questions. Animefags will complain when mangafags post spoilers for the manga in the thread.      And that's not entertaining to you?    At first, yes.   Then it drags on and everyone suffers from it.      I was never a butt person, monster or not. Always liked legs better...  ...which is odd, seeing as they're kind of attached.       Would sniff her snatch    Is that organisation M.O.N even all that effective ?  Daily reminder that Tio is a lanklet and thus inferior to cow girl.   I would rather a cute lanklet who's nice than an abusive cow    Daily reminder a College Basketball player is taller than Tio    He looks like a lanklet too.    Flaws make her perfect just as much as qualities.   I'm in love with Miia!    Is she self-conscious about her features or something ?     Nazi Germany encouraged polygamy     Does that mean Suu is the Protean Dictator then ?    If you could replace a harem girl with a non-harem girl, who would you replace and with whom?

You couldn't just lump some in with the others ?          I like Rachnee's expression.  I'm not sure if it's her feeling adorable or her having no clue what's going on.        The harem is too big, Lala is hardly brought up because there's way too many girls.     Whats MON???     miyako shiina best route     Monster Ops: Neutralization.

I used to think Mero was cute but then I realized that she's slimy and her gills are in a spooky place   I see nothing wrong with any of that.    Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou</span>  Do we know when the anime is actually premiering? Will we get it before the end of the month?       What would sex with the gills be called? What does it feel like?      Possibly rather painful for her, depending. Gills are a rather sensitive area. I mean, if you punch a shark in the gills they get rather hurt.  Though this means you should never punch a mermaid in the sides. Unless she is trying to fucking kill you.      Also, arent gills like, really sharp? that doesnt seem like someplace you'd wanna stick your cock in.    Punches hurt regardless. Imagine a gentle rod being shoved deep inside her gills... How would that feel to the man and what would it be called?      Gilletting, duh.    Sounds about right. Taking a razor-edge to the genitals is usually gilletting.    8th of July.

Sticking your dick in would be like me puncturing your lungs with a stake.    I wonder what a staring contest would be like for Manako now.   Her eye dries up way quicker than the eyes of a regular human, so she will have to blink.    Mero's cute because she has no idea her interests are strange.

The average bird has body temp range of 40° to 42°C (104° to about 108°F)  So it basically makes her opposite of Miia, who had to warm herself up every morning.  I know I am going a bit far, but don't be surprised if Crabman did his reserach.

It's really only an issue at arms length or less. Anything further can be compensated with eye wobble(micro-movements of any individual eye, which the brain stitches together to a current image).    How come leela sucked at baseball so much?     On the plus side, she'd be really good at 2D games     Videogames don't require depth perception at all, you're just looking at a flat surface. She'd have trouble estimating how far the screen was away from her, but there'd be no difference at all in what's being displayed.  In fact, videogames, VR aside, only have a single "eye" anyway, and what the camera sees is shown to the player.     Technically everything we see irl is also a flat image    Damn, that's a shame. It would be glorious    I never watched Futurama, but maybe she just plain sucked at it? Or they wanted to make a joke. I'm assuming any being with monocular vision that had need for range perception would have figured out some form of compensatory mechanism at some point.    She has red hair  And her eye is purple        Next keychains we'll see what their colors are, if a kind anon is willing to post a photo of them      Yes, sort of, but its combined from binocular perception that triangulates the spatial location of objects based on the angle of your eyes, at least at relatively close distances. Within 3 feet almost all depth perception is based on this, beyond that you can make up for it with head movements that simulate the two perspectives two eyes would give you.    Manako probably does a lot of head bobbing, now that I think of it.       You do know those were done before the official colors right?

Still too damn high-pitched. She better drop it a lot lower if she intends to seduce.     I wonder what it would be like if she had the abilities of the Cyclops from Warmachine-Hordes.

Come July, we'll see all six(?) extras in Volume 8 the same way he did all the Ds in Volume Five(Six?).    Better than in the first PV.    Anyone have the "what you're feeling now is normal" edit?

I'm more concerned at how the mothers will sound.  <s>I hope we hear Miias mom ara aras</s>       I want to know how they will make Yukio sound given how scary she is in the manga at times.

UBW Shirou of course because UBW and clocktower  HF shirou is the end just a doll    Fate Shirou, the only one with a Servant that's contracted to him until the final battle. Who the hell needs a Reality Marble when you have a fucking Servant who can shoot beams?  Prisma Shirou did ridiculous shit that he shouldn't be capable of unless he's inside UBW, and that was while he was prana drained.  Assuming he's at 100% and has UBW activated then he's leagues above all the others.    <span class="quote">&gt;Shirou</span> Prisma &gt; UBW &gt; HF &gt; Fate   <span class="quote">&gt;Fate</span> shirou can trace avalon only ones  and every other shirou can trace caliburn too  Can Trace divine weapons</span> except he cant reread the chapter again the devinve weapon are even worse than china copies          Prisma Shirou can summon UBW, he even tried but some shit went wrong. Rejection between his inner world and Archer's?      Probably more along the lines of him being completely drained of prana. He said so himself. He deployed UBW like a couple hours prior to that.    UBW but HF Shirou was the most metal.   I'd say: UBW &gt;= Prisma &gt; HF &gt; Fate     They can't.  None of the other Shirous have ever seen Caliburn. Fate Shirou saw Caliburn through Saber's memories, but that never happened for the others. Fate Shirou is literally the only one with Caliburn.      Yeah, but he was dying. And puppet Shirou is shit.   CG EMIYA gg.   at the beginning of FSN all shirou dreams about Caliburn also doesnt change the fact that shirou saw archers UBW and Memories and HF archer arm knowledge    No, they dream about Excalibur.  And there's no guarantee that Archer has Caliburn either.      Who the fuck voted for Fate Shirou? Come the fuck on.   He even dreams about Caliburn/Excalibur (can't remember) in HF.       I disagree. It should be at least Prisma &gt;= UBW.   But we should wait and see a Prisma's next chapter.       But Archer is aware of Avalon, doesn't that means that he could project and use its powers? If he had Saber at his side, that is.    wait till July</span> This is killing me.    Is there an anime character who can defeat Shirou EMIYA? and I'm not talking about human Fate-route Shirou Emiya. No, I'm not talking about Archer's Arm Nine Lives Blade Works Shirou Emiya. Hell, I'm not talking about Ultimate Master Chef High Jump Jackhammer Emiya either. I'm talking about Post-Grail-War Maximum Power Throne of Heroes-Contracted Counter Guardian Shirou Emiya with the Unlimited Blade Works (which is capable of Rho Aias, Avalon, Caliburn and Three Wing Crane), his two original chinese broadswords (along with Excalibur, Caladbolg, Durandal, Gram, Ea, Ig-Alima, Berserker's Sword, Azoth Sword, Hrunting, Caladbolg II, Tawrich, and Zarich) and a third Archer's Arm on his forehead, capable of cooking Udon, Katsudon, Chikaraudon, Curryudon, Yakiudon, Kakeudon, Kitsuneudon, Zaruudon, Tempura Udon and even Ramen noodles, equipped with Monohoshizao(capable of using Tsubamegaeshi) and a Holy Shroud because he is a master in Curry and Mapo Tofu, a perfect Mystic Code (that can use origin Bullets), control of both Rin's mana pool and the prana from Akasha, with Saber Arturia's DNA and Avalon implanted in his chest, his four Harem Housemates guarding him and nine Servants floating behind him AFTER he absorbed the Grail Contents from Sakura's pussy, entered Mind of Steel Mode, cast Strengthening magecraft on everybody and used Meat: Limit Expand so he can use their Prana while they are under contract.   Karna?    Dunno. We don't know exactly how his Grail War went.  What we do know is the following: He couldn't save Saber.</span> The first time he tried recreating a Noble Phantasm, he crippled his arm temporarily.</span>  So it's obvious things went very differently for him compared to the other Shirous.         this isn't even a contest if you include miyu!shirou   Archer Shirou must've been the shitiest Shirou. If he won that HGW, Saber most likely had Avalon.    How about comparing their best feat in each respective event?  Fate</span> Defeat Heracles with Saber's help UBW</span> Defeat King of Jobber HF</span> Defeat non-godhand Heracles Prisma</span> Lose to Space bending able Gilgamesh card. Most of information is not showed yet.             Currently, what is the strongest Prisma character?    Lose to Space bending able Gilgamesh card.</span> No he rekt her in the end, he lost to Lancelot since natural counter and all.     There should be a reference to Sparks Liner High in there somewhere.    Looks like Tanaka.    Wait, so people treat Prismaverse canon ?    But he defeated Angelica.    How the fuck is puppet Shirou stronger than UBW.   Miyu Shirou needs to jackhammer Rin and Luvia to get more mana for a longer UBW.   Nasu has stated why does he need to write an Illya route when we have Prisma Illya on the UBW BD Interviews. Every since then more people have been accepting it as they should have been.     I can see this happening, based Hiroyama haven't skipped the mana transfers.    But Prisma Illya mana transfer is all done via hardcore kissing.  In which case Miyu and Illya make better candidates anyways since almost unlimited mana via magic wands.     Rin's tattoo on one shoulder</span> Luvia's shoulder on the other</span>  Shirou should just jackhammer everyone until he's as covered in tattoos as Avenger.       Depends. Given time the UBW version will be the strongest by far.  But if you're just taking the best of each universe based on what they did on screen, it's a toss up between UBW and Prisma.  Fate has the shittiest projection skill.  HF can't fight a sustained battle.          Miyuverse Shirou is like Archer-lite, he's capable of Unlimited Blade Works with a huge variety of Noble Phantasms to work with from fighting the Ainsworths, and his projection is much more advanced than F/SN Shirou. Bazett is a Servant-tier monster who beat Prisma's Archer and Lancer 1v1 With the Kaleidosticks, Ilya and Miyu are capable of effectively becoming Servants with infinite prana, or just cannons of massive magical energy. Using both of the sticks at once, Ilya can overclock her magic circuits and output enough raw power to match Ea.     Nobody in Prisma Illya has yet to equip Red Saber yet.   Is there any servant that can beat Karna?  And I’m not just talking about charioteer lance wielding son of the Sun God Karna. And I’m not just talking about Karna capable of using all 15 Shastra’s, including Daarma Paasha, Naga Paasha, and Kaala Paasha. Hell, I’m not even talking about Karna after inheriting Vijiya’s Bow (Guaranteeing victory for the holder no matter what circumstance) from Lord Parashurama after training for years to become the greatest warrior and obtaining Brahmanda Astra (Which alone has the power to destroy our entire solar system). I’m talking about Suryalok abiding Karna barring all curses capable of using all Upasamhaara Astras including but not limited to Satyavanta, Satyakeerti, Dhristha, Rabhasa, Pratihaaratara, Paraanmuka, Avaanmukha, Dashaaksha, Shatavaktra, Dashasheersha, Shatodara, Padmanaabha, Mahaanaabha, Jyotisha, Vinidra, Daitya, Pramadhana, Suchibaahu, Mahaabaahu, Saarchirmaali, Dhritimaali, Vrittiman, Ruchira, Pitrya, Ssaumansa, and also Vidhoota, Makara, Karaveerakara, Dhana, Dhaanya, Kaamaroopa, Kaamaruchira, Moha, Aavarana, and thus Jrimbhaka, Sarvanaabha, Varana, wielding the Vasavi Shakti (Capable of killing even Gods with one stab), firing off every single Astra (Even Naga-Astra which delivers deadly poison upon impact), and receiving blessings from Bhūmi, Agni, Varuna, Vayu, Surya, and Indra. I’m talking about Messiah Karna that has Mohini Astra as well which is capable of negating all magic and Maheshwarasta which can reduce even celestial beings to ashes; wielding multipurpose astras, which naturally includes Andhatamisr, Mahatarany, Chakshushmat, Shaktinash, Vishvavasumah, Antak, Mriitunjay, Sarvasmritinashan and Sarvasmitidharan, Bhay, Ahbayankraaindr, Maharog, Namatraym, Ayurnash, Kalasamkarchan, Mahasur, Muladurg, Muk, Mahavagvidiny, Vedataskar, Hiranyaksh, Mahavarah, Hiranyakaship, Urganrisimh, Balindr, Vasudev, Sankarshan, Pradyumn, Kalyastra and Kalkyastra, Mahamoh and Shambhav Astras.     Did you guys know that Fate/Grand Order will be Japan only? You must change every setting in your phone, google account and gmail to japanese to make it work on Android.   In a 1v1? Prisma&gt;HF&gt;UBW&gt;Fate Prisma shirou is pretty much servant tier and even though he wasn't even at his full power he manage to beat a character that was pretty much gilgamesh w/o ea. HF shirou is stronger than UBW shirou because he would already know how much of a thread ubw is and wouldn't allow ubw shirou use it. Fate shiru can't trace caliburn w/o saber and his other projections are pretty shitty so he's the weakest.      Not sure, but Sakuralot is the most deadliest character right now.    implying I haven't already for other japanese mobage</span>    Defeat non-godhand Heracles</span> He had God Hand. God Hand is the body, not the skin as many believe.    Prisma Illya obviously. HF Shirou is an equal match until swordcancer kicks in.    Non-God Hand Heracles</span> At no point is it said he doesn't have God Hand. God Hand is his body, not his skin.    UBW Shirou is a beast in UBW, so UBW Shirou is the best.   I take it as what happens if kiritsugu didn't fuck up.    She was so fast that poor Shirou didn't even realize what happened until he was already wrecked.    That doesn't really sound that hard to do.    Humans cannot be Servant-tier without a lot of factors and counter matching of abilities in the mix. Prisma Illya card servants are not actually Servants. Class cards are mage constructed, they shouldn't be able to actually tap into the Throne and summon Heroic Spirits. The manifestations are essentially fakes and should only represent a portion of their power. I even suspect they are weaker because the purpose of the Class Cards are for equipping.    No.    You'll be blown away by HF Shirou.    I think that anon meant skinless Heracles since the mud corroded his skin which allowed for Nine Lives to tear through as easily as it did.    Anyone who doesn't answer Prisma Shirou has clearly not actually read Prisma  He basically has all of UBW and HF's Shirou's abilities with almost none of their drawbacks. In the span of his one fight we've seen, he: Invokes Nine Lives Blade Works</span> Projects a full 7-petal Rho Aius to block a rain of Noble Phantasms</span> Projects Ig-Alima, a mountain-sized Divine Construct, to use as a ramp</span> Matches Gate of Babylon sword-spam without UBW</span> After all of this still has enough prana to start invoking Unlimited Blade Works, but bursts a magic circuit</span> Projects Rho Aius again</span> Projects Overedge Kanshou and Bakuya</span> Uses the Triple-Linked Crane Wings technique to defeat Gilgamesh</span> Gets almost cut in half by Wormsalot</span> While bleeding out on the floor still has enough in him to project Rho Aius one more time to protect his imouto</span> Survives</span> Even despite the constant overclocking wrecking his body he suffers nowhere near the damage as Heaven's Feel Shirou and has far more prana and experience than Unlimited Blade Works Shirou As expected of a big brother                    It was more like she did something he thought impossible, if he had known about her abilities he could have reacted accordingly.    Servant tier=/=Heroic spirit tier  where Heroic Spirits&gt;servants If bazzet is servant tier based on what we have seen then a fully recovered prisma shirou should also be there.       It's too bad he gets zero screentime Hopefully we'll hear about Miyuverse Kiritsugu in the next chapter     Fate Shitou because he has Seiba unlike his counterparts.    What bothers me about Priya's Shirou is that he's basically HF Shirou but there's no penalty.   Can Shirous project waifus? Can he create life?   Did you really have to add Prisma Illya Shirou? It's not even a contest anymore - The dude can trace divine constructs. That alone makes him stronger. It's also quite clear that he has enough mana to sustain several weapons - Without needing Rin to back him up at all.  After him, is UBW Shirou. He can do everything that HF Shirou can do (It's just tracing Berserker's Axe and his sword skills and eliminating ONE of his lives).      Sounds like Prisma Shirou just undermines everything about VN Shirou.    The point is he's able to even attempt to recreate a Divine Construct as a human without having an aneurism By the time he becomes Prisma Archer his projection has advanced enough to replicate Excalibur.     Right. I'm still of the belief that the Class Card manifestations aren't actually Servant-tier though. That's not to say that Shirou isn't stronger than Bazett, but I do not think he should be Servant-tier strong since it's pretty defined that without a lot of other factors thrown in, Servants trump any kind of mage outside of extremely bad match ups.    The difference of Miyu Shirou is experience. His 5th HGW should have gone completely different.  Fate Shirou has Seiba. UBW Shirou was forced to UBW due to Gil. HF Shirou had Archer's arm.  His divine stuff is still chinese knockoff tier though.   He needs mana to pull it off though.             If you're waifu is a sword, yes.    That doesn't mean God Hand isn't active. It's never mentioned that it isn't active for Black Berserker, people just assumed as much because he's losing his skin. God Hand is his whole body and nullifies attacks, it isn't just really hard skin.    They're not so different Prisma Shirou just chose correctly     He only reacted after he was cut. He was literally speedblitzed.   Easily.   He needs mana to pull it off though.</span> The issue in replicating a Divine Construct is not mana limitations, it's being able to comprehend the materials and construction that created the weapon so that you can reproduce the process.    UBW Shirou easily has the most potential out of all of them. The guy's basically got it made by the end of the route.   His skin is turning brown and his hair is turning white. And he still managed to break a circuit as well, so there is a penalty, just a smaller one.  Plus you have to take into account that Prisma Shirou started off with his training much much younger, so unlike HF Shirou who just received a massive wave a power he couldn't handle it makes sense Prisma Shirou would have much less repercussions.      HF Shirou is getting a penalty because he's skipping the years of hell Archer and Prisma Shirou went through to develop their abilities and his body is nowhere near able to handle it.   https://d.maxfile.ro/zgxnzrlsjg.web<wbr>m  What do people think? I just made this.  </wbr>   No that's shirou when he borrows archers arm and gets btfo for it.    I'd say he's more of a mix of the "cool" parts of Shirou. HF Shirou couldn't readily use UBW, plus look at his appearance, he's half way to Archer.  We also don't know what his ideals were or if they even changed. He clearly had an extremely different back story compared to most other Shirous. I'm really excited for the next chapter to elaborate on that.      I thought Shirou was defined by the struggle of his ideals, not his powerlevel In that case he's quite similar to Heaven's Feel Shirou for choosing to devote himself entirely to saving one life above all others. The difference is he chose to protected a scared little girl rather than a monster.     Outside of SLH (which very well might not be animated) isn't the flashiest thing HF Shirou does is take on Berserker? And that's technically, outside of the inner monologue stuff, a pretty short scene.    So HF Shirou    Needs some bad photoshopping over everything but there's potential    He had God Hand. He kills Berserker 9 times with "Nine Lives Blade Works". The 4 previous lives had been taken by the shadow/Assassin when he was captured, and hadn't fully recovered yet.   https://d.maxfile.ro/ikfhmamczk.web<wbr>m 60fps </wbr>  Prisma Shirou's back story, when?   NEXT CHAPTER   How can Silver Link announce a 3rei adaptation when 3rei isn't even finished?   Chrome gives me a warning bruh.    pomf died so this is one of the new replacements it directs you to on it's site. It is safe.    In July, no Priya this month. This is too much.   WAT       I've been out of the loop, source?    I should have clarified in the aspect of his ability, not so much in his mentality and ideal. UBW is meant to be powerful and unique, but limited by a Shirou's low mana supply and the inability to project divine weapons. It's a separate story and charcter, but it was a pretty big deal for original Shirou to not being able to manifest UBW on his own or reproduce divine weapons. Then again, Excalibur was meant to be impossible to project, but that happens too.    Literally next chapter    People wanted a 3rei anime announcement at the end of Herz like with the previous 2 seasons, but how can they do that when 3rei isn't even complete?    At the rate of 10 episodes a year, 3rei should easily be done by 2017.    Prisma Shirou is a mix of UBW and HF though.   Doll Shirou is the strongest of all the F/SN Shirou right?  He has experience with using Archer's arm and can summon UBW if he tries.     Because Fate Shirou is shit.     WIld card. Never stated how many magic circuits the doll has.   The 27 magic circuits that Shirou had were destroyed, his soul got grafted. So what's the power limits of the body?  It's stated he can use his magecraft so..         It's obviously pic related.    Why not? They can split 3rei and 2 or 3 parts and keep the yearly pace they have been.    Isn't Miyuverse Shirou king of the jobbers, though? He does some cool shit, but does he ever actually beat anybody?    and can summon UBW if he tries.</span>  No, Rin says he could possibly summon it if he trains. There are a lot of variables there. Namely, he might not train. We have no fucking clue if he really did anything in the two years after HF.      No he is the weakest of all Shirou's, he can't use his circuits correctly and most of the knowledge he got was limited as he couldn't dwell on the arm for too long because of the sword cancer. Him using UBW is just Rin's assessment but who knows how long it will take for him to manage it.    He technically took down Angelica, didn't he?    Counter Guardian Shirou - unlimited mana -Can trace almost anything  -Can fire nukes -Projections as solid as they get -Good fighter -Best cook            So there no true way to assess how functional he is unless Nasu tells us more.      Never stated how many magic circuits the doll has.</span> Dude what it's the same. The doll body can't circulate the mana properly so he is gimped.     Magic circuits are specifically stated to be part of the soul. Regardless of what vessel he's in, Shirou has 27 circuits of the same quality/specialization. The reason doll Shirou is OP is because he absorbed tons of Archer's battle experience and knowledge, and he's capable of forming UBW if he trains towards it.    Is there any servant that can beat Karna?</span> This guy?     No there is, Nasu gave us enough info there. He is really gimped in comparison to the other Shirou's.    He managed to wreck Gil Angelica after being imprisoned for a while and running low on prana.  Sakuralot was a surprise attack so it's hardly jobbing. Lancelot is more or less hard counter to EMIYA, unless Shirou goes broken NP and go SUPERHERO on Sakuralot.     Best girl   With only Kuro's help.    he reason doll Shirou is OP</span> But he is not he can't even use his mana properly and we only know that he absorbed some knowledge based on the shit he projected.     Fate and UBW Shirou eventually end up at the same place anyway, in terms of powerlevels. He learns to trace Avalon in Fate, but it's useless to him unless Saber is around to activate it.  HF Shirou has the knowledge he gleaned from having Archer's arm but IIRC his doll body gimps his ability to use mana correctly. Also regardless of what Rin says he should't be able to form UBW even with training, since it's built on his ideal and at the end of HF he throws it away for a happy life.  Prisma Shirou is ridiculous and is basically Archer's Arm tier Shirou with none of the drawbacks, plus he can still use UBW. So he probably wins, unless we're counting CG Shirou.       UBW would win in long term but if it came down a fight happening at that very moment HF would win as Archer's arm is just to much a OP boost even though it is only temporary.   Angelica can bend space, which nullify every UBW's advantage. She is just strong, so losing to her isn't a jobbing.    Best Cook</span> That's debatable.     unless Shirou goes broken NP and go SUPERHERO on Sakuralot.</span> That's not what Julian said. He would get fucked no matter how many NPs he brings out.     Fate and UBW Shirou eventually end up at the same place anyway, in terms of powerlevels.</span> UBW Shirou will end up there sooner, he was mentored by Archer after all in his own way.     He's only had one fight, in which he performed a highly impressive series of feats, most of which would strain any F/SN Shirou to do on their own. He fought Angelica-Gilgamesh and beat her with Kuro's help, which he needed only because of the Ainsworth's ridiculously broken portal shenanigans on top of Gate of Babylon spam. Then he got ambushed by Sakura-Lancelot who is Shirou and Archer's absolute hard counter and understandably got wrecked.      Even if Fate Shirou catches up to UBW Shirou in a general sense, there are some weapons he should never be able to obtain, like most of the stuff UBW Shirou got from GoB, and I'd assume a chunk of what he nabbed from Archer.    BPs blow up on touch, and Julian can go fuck himself it's not like he knows all of Shirou's skills.    Shirou and Archer's absolute hard counter</span> I thought that Diamuid would be that. His Anti-Magic may screw with projections.     There is.     He never lost to Angelica. He did need help to beat her, but if you win it can't really be called jobbing.  Sakuralot is when I'd say he jobbed though. Getting hyped up, and then being taken out so quickly and all that.  Still, he technically did manage to fight the Ainsworths by himself well enough to save Miyu, somehow send her to another world, and piss Julian off more than anyone else ever did.         The only way Heaven's Feel Shirou would win is doing something ridiculous like projecting Excalibur which would just be a mutual kill at best    You can't blow up something that's not yours anymore.   <span class="quote">&gt;HF Shirou</span> strongest</span> That's a glass canon right there. At least UBW can keep consistent     Actually, If UBW Shirou gets UBW up HF Shirou is fucked.    Anti-magic still follows normal stat conventions in that it's a curse that can't affect stronger phenomena. Gae Dearg is B rank, so if Shirou pulled out anything from UBW that's B or higher it won't be nullified. Likewise UBW is EX rank, so Dearg wouldn't be able to dispel it.  It does mean he couldn't rely on K+B, though.      I meant in an event before Shirou's capture.  We need more information on that. In the next chapter I hope.      Unlimited Blade Works and the projections they pull from it are limited to close-range weapons which Lancelot is the absolute master of The only way either could possibly beat Lancelot is Broken Phantasm sniping or maybe just overwhelming him with swordspam in Unlimited Blade Works     That's if she can grab it at Mach 11.    Dearg was countering KoH that is an A++ NP.    Probably not really. Arjuna only won because Karna got fucked over by bullshit.    If Herc and Saber can deflect it then Lancelot can grab it.    Miyuverse Shirou will job, and he will job hard. The main character is Illya, so even if he's the strongest Shirou, he will die, and Miyu will cry ;_;    Sniping or Swordspam</span> That would be either EMIYA (who admittedly doesn't spend much time being an actual traditional archer) or Gil's forte.     It depends, apparently Lancelot was only capable of doing as well as he did against Gil because of Mad Enhancement stat boosts.    I feel like Karna is basically destined to have that happen to him if they ever meet again. Because life is unfair.    Hasn't she suffered enough?    Deermud lacks any high end protection skills or NP. Archer might get wrecked if he tries to go on melee, but ranged mode will wreck Deermud.     UBW is confirmed to only be annoying against a regular Servant.    That's only under someone as shit as Kariya. His stats are still equal or above the 2 I already mentioned.   Deadeyes Illiya give me an unexplainable boner.   That's pretty much the same for many Servants. Had Archer spend more time sniping with Caladbolg or Hrunting, he'd take down a lot.    Eye of the Mind True.    Depends on a servant though. Using it on a Saber or Lancer will fuck UBW. Assassin,Berserker and Rider are questionable. Caster class is definitely fucked.       Which is complete bullshit that I will never accept.    That's because Kariya is shit as a master and needed mad enchantment boosts to make up for it. Lancelot under a good master like Rin would be unstoppable. He's specifically stated to be a much better swordsman than Arturia, and while Alondite isn't as powerful as Excalibur it gets the job done. Throw in KoH and FSG, and Saber Lancelot under a good master could probably solo the HGW.    What Nasu broadly speculates in interviews and what Nasu writes are two very different things  It was stated Lancelot could be overwhelmed by Gate of Babylon swordspam if Gil had simply done more. Unlimited Blade Works has a higher output than Gate of Babylon. Therefore, Unlimited Blade Works could overwhelm Lancelot.        Berserker would cruise over UBW with ease.  Assasin get fucked hard.  Rider is questionable.        annoying is an understatement but you're right ubw wouldn't be the trump card like it was against gil    Let's step up danger levels in HF.     Kariya was surprisingly good for such a makeshift magus. Had Zouken not wanted to screw him over so hard, he could have done better. If someone other than a prana-heavy Berserker-Lancelot was summoned, Kariya would have been alright in prana stocks.     Berserker Herc got wrecked 6 times in a non UBW situation.  Archer might have pulled it off if he went UBW.      Except in Fate a still seriously wounded Archer was able to take six of Berserker's lives, all while not using UBW and specifically holding back to make sure Ilya wasn't harmed. A full powered Archer with UBW up would wreck Berserker 1v1.    It was stated Lancelot could be overwhelmed by Gate of Babylon swordspam if Gil had simply done more.</span> Which is proven wrong by Iskander feat and Prisma Illya.     Deflecting=/=Grabbing   Come on.      much better swordsman than Arturia</span> I question that. His Eternal Arms Mastery allowed Lancelot to have all of his motor skills along with Mad Enhancement. In close combat, he's better than he was originally because of the extra strength.     This. HF Shirou is strong, but UBW Shirou is more versatile    Being good for shit still means you are shit. He was said to nerf the Servant during the novel.    Not that losing swords everytime he swings them is uncommon for him. Happens regularly, and he just replaces them right away.    Iskander feat</span> I doubt that Iskander being skewered from head to toe by likely less than 32 NPs counts too much. Prisma Illya</span> Different users with the same techniques. We shouldn't count it. Archer-Ilya projected Excalibur &amp; all.       UBW is basically a more effective GoB. Anyone that Gil doesn't need to use his chain or Ea to defeat will also be defeated by Shirou.     I though we were talking about Shirou's UBW here.  But yeah, I agree that Archer's UBW + BP is absurdly strong.       Him having EAM is actually proof of why he was so much better.   Also The enemy’s strong prowess that was many times greater than her own</span>       And fucking Hrunting, he can swordspam and meanwhile ready some Hrutings are your done son. That shit is broken.    I'm going to need to re-read the part in the LN that said that. Can you please direct me there?    In F/Z he's listed as the strongest of the Round Table. The wiki (grain of salt, I know) says that he can supposedly beat Arturia 1v1 if she doesn't have Avalon, and could hold off Gawain while NotS is active and finish him off once night fell.   Granted this is sort of contradicted in F/Z when he loses to Saber while she still has invisible air out, but that was more because Kariya ran out of mana.      That's a little too general there. I'm going to need to know the chapter, volume, etc. I need to know the context to fully understand what that was implying.    by likely less than 32 NPs</span> A barrage of 80, to be exact.  Different users with the same techniques. We shouldn't count it.</span> You really aren't trying to imply Sakura is more skilled than Lancelot, are you?        Arondight is a counter to Saber though, isn't it? If I'm recalling correctly it has anti-dragon properties.    Yeah, I remember that as well.    Fate/Zero:Act 16 Part 7   and could hold off Gawain while NotS is active and finish him off once night fell</span> That one is taken from Extra/CCC if I recall correctly.        he's listed as the strongest of the Round Table</span> And in Extra Gawain is said to be his equal. In fact, we should take everything there with a grain of salt. It frequently says "was said to be" more than "it is". he can supposedly beat Arturia</span> Anti-Dragon crap. This is a rather unfair comparison. hold off Gawain while NotS is active</span> We should approach this with caution, Zero came out before Extra did &amp; thus Lancelot was written in before Gawain was. Given the number of retcons, I'd be unsure.         Doesn't seem to be that much different for Lancelot.    In F/Z he's listed as the strongest of the Round Table</span> Then Nasu wrote EXTRA and based Gawain. He can cook and Excaliblast.     Fate/Zero:Act 1 Part 5 Isn’t it obvious? Kariya, you should know that as a magus, your abilities are not just one or two notches below the other Masters. It will affect the basic abilities of the Servant.</span>    Literally everyone in Ilya is OP as fuck and a serious threat to win the Grail.  So Ilya    <span class="quote">&gt;Gawain is mentioned</span>  Oh boy here we go.     Zouken being a dickworm</span> Say it ain't so.      Yeah Gawain is OP as hell. Granted, that seems to be a running theme in Fate/Extra and CCC.     Didn't Arthur whacked Lancelot good, although it broke the Excalbiur/Calburn in the stories because dishonorable blow or shit like that?  So what stops a non mental breakdown Seiba with Excalibur whacking Lancelot good with Excalibur?      implying wouldn't give cold hard facts that his son is a shit</span>    So what stops a non mental breakdown Seiba with Excalibur whacking Lancelot good with Excalibur?</span> Pressure to the point you can't retaliate.     Gawain was so OP that they had to take him out early on CCC.     We don't know whether he used UBW or not. There are no shown details of the battle, only the set up and the aftermath.     Archer had fully recovered by that point. A big deal was made out of the fact that he had finally recovered from the wound Arturia inflicted on him.   specifically holding back to make sure Ilya wasn't harmed</span>  No, against Berserker he was finally able to go all out for once, and it made him excited. He could not have threatened Ilya in the same way that Gilgamesh did, because Heracles was far too strong to leave an opening for him to target her - he would be completely occupied just fighting Berserker to survive and score kills.     No, he can't. Preparing a broken phantasm is one of the most strenuous things Archer can do, it requires all of his focus to do it.                 Sakura is more skilled than Lancelot</span> I'm implying more on the swordspamming side.  Fate/Zero:Act 16 Part 7</span> Thank you anon.  I'm taking that one with grain of salt. It also said "Her sword of light that promised victory—it had long since become meaningless, in the hands of its owner who had lost the will to fight"  Fate/Zero:Act 1 Part 5</span> Thanks anon.  I'm still noting that the person speaking is Zouken &amp; that it's aid that   "For a makeshift magus, Kariya's suitability as a Master was exceptional. The fact that he was able to endure the maddened Lancelot's outrageous magical energy consumption for as long as he did is a feat truly deserving of praise. While he might have been better off if Zouken hadn't punished him by forcing him to summon a Berserker, well… I hate to say it, but the only reason Lancelot was able to fight Gilgamesh as well as he did was due to the parameter boost from being maddened."  So I'm hesitating to fully believe Zouken.                    Nah, Gil's spam isn't nearly as fast as Archer's single BP.     That was when Arthur fought Percival, not Lancelot.     But he can't beat Lancelot even when Numeral is active. Such a joke.    Uh, Arthur lost Caliburn in a battle that somehow violated honor, but it wasn't against the Lance.   If Lancelot made an appearance in Fate/extra how OP would he be?   So how different would the Round Table be if everyone was a girl?    What the fuck is even CHIKARAUDON, WHAT!  Also:  curryudon</span>  Fucking overpowered. I bet the guy can make Ciel do his bidding with the blah blah vampire powahs immortality blah blah.          Again, if those 2 could deflect, he should be able to grab. He has shown to be able to do impossible feats already.    Depends on how OP the plot requires    It would be an anime.     He would probably be a much easier opponent than Gawain due to not having absurdly good stats and a big stick to hit you with. His thing is all about skill and buffs from Arondight and concealing his identity, which, while strong by all measures, is much lower in straight raw power.     Less NTR, I guess    SoL.  Dogakobo.  Fund it.        Would the king still have to be a man?    he can't beat Lancelot even when Numeral is active</span> Implying the writers weren't blatantly favouring Lancelot</span> Rereading that part, it kept on stating "Gawain's evilness" over &amp; over thus apparently stating that Lancelot murdering Gawain's brothers was okay. Lancelot could rape someone but Gawain be considered evil for looking at Lancelot weird for doing so.      Deflecting is different from grabbing dude. I say he can't mach 11 is too fast for any servant to grab like it's nothing.   <span class="quote">&gt;Lancelot</span> has Eternal Arms Mastery A+ rank as proof of his skill</span>  Heracles</span> has Nine Lives, his fighting style, which is a fully fledged noble phantasm, as proof of his skill</span>  kek         Is there any character that can defeat Bullshit?</span>    Losing the will to fight doesn't really have anything to do with your battle prowess.  Besides, Eternal Arms Mastership description says Mastership of combat arts has reached the point of being said to be unrivaled in one's era. </span>  And about Zouken and Kariya, him of all people should be aware of how shitty the person he trained is. What you quoted even says "for a makeshift magus" for a reason. He is good for a makeshift magus, but in the end, he is still just a makeshift magus.         Spin-off of Proto-Saber with a R63 Round Table as his harem? Fem-Gawain, the niece, is the Imouto for being the closest knight to a younger sister</span> Fem-Lancelot is yandere for the king</span> Fem-Key is now Arthur's adopted big-sis</span> Fem-Percival is now straight</span>        To be fair, all Lancelot is about is fighting. He fought so much and go so good, that nobody would fight him. So he disguised himself and fought so well under so many other names that he essentially created other legendary warriors that were actually just him. And he fought in so many situations and with so many different weapons that he can retain his peak fighting ability with literally any weapon, and under any kind of mental interference.   The guy is good at fighting, and that's all he's fucking good at. He's the strongest by virtue of being the most autistic of the Rounds.      I still like Herakles more, I don't know, he's cooler.    said to be</span> That appears too many times in the descriptions. It's virtually always "said to be the best" or something implying there will be future retcon.     Nope more. Just sexier.    that nobody would fight him</span> Actually many wanted to fight him. It's just that Lancelot had a habit of constantly disguising himself to be mysterious. It's practically his hobby.     Depends on how good his Master is and how many weapons he gets. Normally, he should at least be on par with Numeral Gawain.    "Said to be" is sort of how the legends that create Heroic Spirts work    Fem-Percival is now straight</span> Fuck that shit.    Anyone else dislike how everyone and their mom has a reality marble? I thought a reality marble was special and rare. But Kiritsugu had one according to Kayneth and it was the source of his time alter. Rider had a reality marble as well which makes me think why the fuck does a non-mage has one? I doubt his reality marble was in his legend anyways.     Which Shiki can take all Shirou without breaking a sweat? My vote is on SHIKI.     Lancelot isn't that strong. He was always extremely vulnerable to magic in the mythology compared to the other knights.     FoG might be useless due to the situation, it's questionable how KoH would work, the lack of JETS will upset the jetposter, etc.    Speed of reaction comes from AGI, if someone like Saber was able to react to those BPs, someone with Lancelot skill can certainly grab that.     on par with Numeral Gawain</span>  No you daft clod, he was on pure defense while Gawain had the Numeral buff active. He only went on offense during the night. He couldn't match Gawain's physical abilities to fight evenly while the Numeral was active. Whenever it was inactive, however, yes, he was the superior fighter.       It created a crapton of hyperboles which ended up being modified in the Fate version. We can't have 100+ "strongest weapons" walking around.    UWB shirou is an extremely strong human and HF shirou is a weak servant. Either way Fate shirou is the weakest.      Saber was only able to block them - and even then, only barely. Catching something and blocking something are two entirely different things.     Fuck that shit</span> Fine, have Percival be a trap &amp; therefore the homo-route.     He has D just from the ring and no Saber boost. I would say he should have C or B under the Saber class.    How many fucking times must I repeat that grabbing is different than deflecting.     Saber didn't block them thanks to her agility, she did it thanks to her Instinct that warned her of the attack beforehand.     I think he has the most potential though. He did manage to project Caliburn perfectly despite only dreaming about it.     But Kiritsugu had one according to Kayneth and it was the source of his time alter.</span> Kiritsugu's RM was the more retarded excuse for a RM. Keyneth was so ok with it that it was stupid.  She should've been trying to capture him instead of killing him.       Works for me.    Shiki &gt; SHIKI &gt; SHIKI &gt; Shiki &gt; Shiki    That may have been transferred into his stats. Lancelot's MAG stat is below that of even Shirou-Saber &amp; two ranks below Gawain's. I'm unsure about magical def though.     No no, Kiritsugu was using a bounded field similar to a reality marble, not a real reality marble. If it was a true reality marble, the mage association would never have given that spell in the crest back to him.     Shiki &gt; SHIKI &gt; Shiki &gt; Shiki &gt; Shiki &gt; SHIKI = Shiki    Shiki &gt; Shiki</span> implying</span>     So if Lancelot impregnated Fem Gawain here, would Galahad be born?    You still need to be fast enough to react to whatever you have been warned off.   C AGI</span>   And how many times must I repeat that there doesn't seem to be a difference for Lancelot? He grabbed a fucking killing blow from an A AGI Servant while he was still stunned from a previous blow to the head.          Perfect.    Normally, he should at least be on par with Numeral Gawain.</span> kek  Considering Lancelot literally couldn't touch Gawain during the day and only won by dragging the fight out into the night, I'd say no.       <s>I like it.</s>    Lancelot MAG is reduced for being under the Berserker class, he normally has D.   I know it's kind of an unspoken rule that everyone should have known about Fate SN but would it kill you to not put spoilers right at the start of the thread like that? You guys basically ruined the series for me even before I know it exists.   Has D</span> I thought he gave that to the Queen.    does anyone know the name of the first song they use in this trailer for UBW? It sounds a lot like a new version The Beginning of the End from the Fate/Zero ost but I can't seem to find it anywhere else.   implying Shiki &gt;&gt;&gt; Shiki</span>  Get out filthy tertiary.      Tohno is the only one who couldn't, the strain of killing all of Shirou's swords would wreck him    For Rider is only the representation of his followers faith in him. As for Kerry, it isn't even a Reality Marble, it was a boundery field. So, we have three real Reality Marbles in the franchise, Extra Caster, Rider and EMIYA/Shirou, and all of them are Noble Phantasm (except Shirou's UBW). It isn't that much at the end considering that only heroic spirits and Shirou ever use one.      forgot to post trailer https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=NPI<wbr>tqNsCXM4</wbr></span> [ ]    Further proof that flavor of the season sort of dictates everything. People don't think about it so much as just voting the one they know or want.  An entire point was HF Shirou is the strongest in the short term, as he had knowledge and tracing ability far beyond he could handle as it was literally killing him. It was driven a hundred times over in the route that this is power more than any human can handle, power more than humans, but in the immediate short term it makes for a very powerful gun. UBW Shirou never even got close to matching Archer in power really, it was Archer at 1/10th power who only stopped fighting because he realized that the ideal really was beautiful which created a gap. Archer's Arm you get five shots before you die horribly perhaps, but you are legit super human even without using the arm as slowly inflects you even before its unsealed, and gain even more power when it is unsealed. Capability of moving faster than the speed of sound and reinforcing your body are possible.  Can run 45 KPH same as Kotomine, an agent of the Church, fall out of a three story window without damage, and was very tough physically. The only Shirou that could about on par fight a servant, because he was basically a servant in power due to Archer's influence taking charge.  Sure he ain't surviving for sure, but short term burst he's the strongest. Only one that gets close is Miyuverse Shirou who's taken a lead on the others in experience decently. Also Miyuverse Shirou works in a universe where the rules are a bit more loose.  HF &gt; Miyu &gt;&gt; UBW &gt;&gt; Fate            Stalled Gawain for hours</span> He might not be on par in stats but apparently he sure makes up for it with skill. It's not like Gawain could touch him either, Lancelot was still in a good enough shape to wreck him after the buff was gone.    When HF movies come out, we'll officially be dealing with goddamn quadrinaries  These threads, which have only steadily declined in quality since F/Z and then UBW TV,  will become the ultimate cesspools of autism and retardation  YOROKOBE       Why is Gil so overpowered?   -Better physical fitness thanks to the Card</span>  Are people stupid?  Shirou never had a card there, he did not install a card.        Well it definitely sounds more Kajiuraish than Fukusawaish, but I can't my finger on it either   I realized TM powerlevel threads is equivalent of rule lawyering for table top games.   Because he's the original hero  Original is better since you are strengthened in concept by all those that came after you.      You said he was on par with Numeral Gawain, except he had to play in full defense like Ciel vs Servants.  You're full of shit.      This thread....is like talking about how strong Kirito is. When did /a/ become such casual?    wreck him</span> It's said somewhere in the Arthurian legends that if an enemy outlasts Gawain, Gawain will tire &amp; thus become weakened. It's actually following the lore somewhat but this is coupled with the French writers' Lancelot boner too.     HF Shirou is the strongest in the short term</span> I take everything into account, and puppet Shirou is garbage.  UBW Shirou have time to maximize his techniques to the fullest and become even stronger than Archer when he died.        They're basically /tg/'s edition wars.     I know the next song they use in the trailer is off the second fate/zero ost, and the last one is the new version of Emiya but I don't remember hearing this song at all in the show so I thought it might be from another fate ost.    When they become so bad, will they then start to become good?    Because 21st century level tech apparently existed back in the Bronze Age    Kirito</span> Daily reminder:  "I raised the mirror in a rush, and the face staring back at me. Black hair that lay neatly over the head, two weak looking eyes that could be seen beneath the slightly long hair, and a delicate face that made people mistake me for a girl even now when I go out in casual clothes with my sister. The calm face of a warrior that &lt;Kirito&gt; had had even a few seconds ago was no longer there. The face that was in the mirror— Was my actual face that I had tried so hard to escape from. "  Light Novel Kirito was ALWAYS a trap. This immediately makes him superior to his anime counterpart.                He had to at least put on pressure or he would have been obliterated by Galatine.   That doesn't seem to be the case for Fate.       If you're going to the latest potential point of a character rather than at their strongest point in-story then Prisma Shirou still wins because he's the only one that we know becomes a specific Archer.    Every HS from the Age of God (literally every HS) is strong as fuck.  Remember that we've only saw what they can do in their Servants shell and nothing more.  full power Cu Chulainn</span> full power Hercules</span> muh dick          /tg/</span> Assuming that Saber's &amp; a Space Marine's appetites overlap, who could satisfy Space Marine Saber's stomach?     Also regardless of what Rin says he should't be able to form UBW even with training, since it's built on his ideal and at the end of HF he throws it away for a happy life.</span> Nigga UBW is from his status as an incarnation and his broken literally selfless mindset.  Going from "A Sword that saves everyone." to "A Sword that saves Sakura." isn't going to completely lock out his RM. Archer gives up on his ideal and can still use UBW, it's just all dark and depressing.       We will never see Archer Hercules</span> We will never see Caster Cu with MUH RUNES</span> We will never see Saber Cu with full-power Fragarach</span>      That doesn't seem to be the case</span> The Fate version seems to follow Malory's collection of French tales more than the English.     We will never see Caster Cu with MUH RUNES</span> Grand Order     we will never see Caster Cu with MUH RUNES</span> About that...    this is a bit off topic but FUCK that shorttext unlimited slam works (that went along with this video: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=fgt<wbr>xb9yBggc)</wbr></span> [ ] was deleted. im so sad right now.   Malory takes both English and French sources. The inclusion of Lance may suggest the latter, but at least he properly tells his faults.    He grabbed a fucking killing blow from an A AGI Servant while he was still stunned from a previous blow to the head.</span> So? Mach 11 is not something a servant can just grab either.     &gt;We will never see Caster Cu with MUH RUNES</span> What is Grand Order?      Nothing. When Marine Saber hungers, the galaxy will burn. Eventually, the Tyranid swarm, which only knows hunger, will meet this enemy, and the battle of appetites will begin and last a thousand years.     Oh, is GO actually getting made? I'm surprised, Nasu    CCC Archer Projections are the strongest possible since what's possible in the Mooncell is greater than what's possible on Gaia.</span> Can trace Excalibur</span> Reached true Heroic Spirit rank</span> Best cook, can make Italian food</span> Compares himself to James Bond</span> Saved humanity more than once</span> Stopped Nuclear war</span> Has become one with the origin on par with the authority of the origin of all gods, putting him in universal tier power far greater than any Guardian.

We will never see Rider-Gawain</span>  He does but there's more French than English. Lancelot was a creation of Chrétien de Troyes which found himself in later the English tales too. The English (I guess except for Sir Malory) depicted Gawain as being the best knight while the French prefered Lancelot. The French also proceeded to heavily dumb down Gawain on multiple cases.      I thought the release date was just going to be delayed indefinitely.    The ability to manifest a Reality Marble comes from having such an overwhelmingly powerful or alien strength of conviction in ones self that you can temporarily usurp the outer world (Gaia) with your own self (the Reality Marble). Heaven's Feel Shirou has had his ideals and convictions shaken and compromised, in ways that resulted in abandonment rather than determination as in Unlimited Blade Works. It can't be said that Heaven's Feel Shirou could not eventually develop Unlimited Blade Works, considering his still highly unique existence as one with both an origin and alignment of "sword", but it is much less likely.      Not even Chaos?    Nasu may be addicted to another game right now but as long as it comes out before DS3 then you won't have to wait 2 extra years.    Further proof that flavor of the season sort of dictates everything.</span> More like the anime confirms the auto pilot bullshit as Shirou was able to match Gil in a sword fight for a while. So it really increases how strong UBW Shirou is. UBW Shirou = HF Shirou     Lancelot is like the Batman of Fate, he has everything you need for keikaku. He can turn any weapon into a NP, can disguise as others, is extremely good at fighting. With some prep time he really can make wonders.    It can still happen!    delayed indefinitely</span> Are we talking about WH40K's status quo here?     NO JETS WHAT THE FUCK? DONT SPEAK NONSENSE.     Barely react and DEFLECT and she had to use her Instincts A. He can deflect it but grabbing it is nonsense.    I don't think the HF films will make as much of a splash on /a/ as UBW did.  First they have to hit theaters, then go to BD, then get subbed, and them wait months if not longer to get to the next part of the story (assuming it's more than one film in the first place). HF has a rolling release, while everyone could watch a new episode of UBW each Saturday.      No Jets means Lancelot's ass gets pounded by Drake's ship badly.    That's C AGI, A+ is like 3 ranks above that and Saber skill is many times shittier than Lancelot.  Instinct can warn you from the incoming threat but how fast you react to it is still done with AGI.      but Lancelot is literally made of JETS     Nice fanfiction. "The words in the story are wrong because this thing I just made up would be contradicted by them."     Getting bitter != giving up your ideals    Instinct can warn you from the incoming threat</span> Her instinct is bordering premonition, she doesn't have to react as fast because she knows where it is coming from. Again I don't see how someone who has to rely fully on agility will be able to grab it.     People always wank in their own way to say one choice is less or more. Ilya said and Shirou proved that his conviction was in no way lacking when he surpassed Archer in HF with the "Can you keep up with me?" moment. From that point on he was more resolute than anyone.  Rin confirms and we already know if he can use magic at all still(he can) that he can still use his reality marble, but it'll take time to learn it.  His world and Archer's world were just incompatible, just like how UBW Shirou and Archer's world would be incompatible. Even if you're the same person if you've lived and thought differently then you aren't the same anymore. No it isn't "He cannot do it because no ideals", the RM is not his ideals, its his life. He didn't learn to do it on his own in this route, he could not use Archer's version, so he just couldn't do it yet. It's nothing so final, it's just not the same situation as UBW where he learned to do it.  You say "He cannot ever do it because he is lesser" when the game says he still entirely has the potential. He got a lot of knowledge shoved up his ass by the arm, some parts of it will be retained even if all of it wasn't, just like with UBW Shirou. If he ever feels like pursuing it then its confirmed he can, but its nothing like what you say.  Like if Rin lost her crest, she would still not have lost everything. The arm is like the crest, it made casting and knowledge easier to the point that it was killing him, but even if Rin loses the Crest its not like she's lost how to use Gandr or her circuits worth anything. She's had to do it so many times that she understands the principles rather than just relying on the notes.           Is Prisma Shirou supposed to be using the Archer Card? I didn't think so, because it would be weird for their to be duplicates of the same card, seeing as the cards come from Miyu's world. And furthermore, whenever Miyu or Illya run out of mana or take too much damage, the card gets forcibly uninstalled, so you would think the same thing would have happened when Sakura knocked his shit in.   and he should be able to use his Realty Marble if he starts training</span> if he starts training</span>  This is the key thing to remember about HF Shirou. If he doesn't train, it doesn't matter how much potential he has. He's Gohan.       Let's put it this way, you can see a bullet coming at you, but you are still yourself, no boost in your speed of reaction or quickness. You saw it coming, but you still fucking died.    The ability to manifest a Reality Marble comes from having such an overwhelmingly powerful or alien strength of conviction in ones self that you can temporarily usurp the outer world (Gaia) with your own self (the Reality Marble).</span> RM's have always come from having perspective more in line with the world's and swapping those perspectives. It's why demons and elementals all have RMs. Shirou doesn't really see himself as a person, he's just a walking sword doing what he feels like he should do. Archer fucking hates himself, gives up on his ideal and can still use UBW because he still see's himself as a sword, not a person so he can still use UBW, it's just all sad.   Read the VN. Archer actually goes give up on his ideal, he's not just throwing a temper tantrum. Shirou doesn't just give him a fucking pep talk, their fight is such a big deal because Shirou actually convinces Archer that he's wrong. Regardless of how shitty the job is, being a Counter Guardian does save people and by trying to quit it's actually Archer that betrayed his ideal, not the other way around.        So was EMIYA just developing Caladbolg II and Rho Aias in his free time while alive or was it during counter guardian work?   Gawain is still noted to be equal to Arthur in skill/power in Nasuland.  Even if he's a joke here, he was quite respected. He was the only knight that survived the onslaught of Vortigern alongside Arthur, as their battle raged for several hours.     Do you think Illyaverse Shirou really doesn't know anything about magic? I reckon he still practices Strengthening magic, in like, the basement or something.    Does that mean he can project Saber?     That's pretty moe actually    We don't really know a lot about Prisma Shirou other than he still being fond of heroes.    No because if I had Saber's premonition I would see it coming before it leaves the Gun and I'll evade.    Only in Fate    Why couldn't he save Saber?  Isn't Archer a combination of Fate Shirou and an Illya Route Shirou, except he could never reach Saber and became a counter guardian?      Is Prisma Shirou supposed to be using the Archer Card?</span> He IS the Archer card     RMs are always based on the users internal world though this Shirou dropped the biggest part of what shaped it. He is no longer a sword but a human.   Since there was never any Grail War in the first place in Illya's world (like going back to the 19th century or whenever it started), does that mean Zouken never went evil (because he started out good, like Kiritsugu, but lost his mind while extending his life so he could keep trying to live out his dream), and so Kariya and even Sakura (if the adoption thing happened in that world too) are alive and happy instead of worm-fodder?   Never understood her properly I suppose. I hope Archer gets to save her one day. <s>Archer x Saber when ufotable</s>    Is Prisma Shirou supposed to be using the Archer Card?</span>  No, he has never installed a card, and no one outside of grails or oddities can even install cards.   The card Kuro uses is the Archer card, the Archer card is EMIYA, EMIYA's power is the same as Emiya's power, so through some coincidence Shirou has the same power as Shirou who was a hero. If I was going to lay it out a bit.  or to put it in a more basic way, this Shirou just leveled up faster since he grew up in a war zone, rather than spending eighteen years in relative peace.          Someone doesn't seem to know how fast a bullet goes, your body can't possibly keep up with the premonition. You will be dead before you can move a muscle, unless you think your current speed is at least at the speed of sound level.     Obviously Bazett didn't fight Shirou from that world to get the card that is now inside of Kuro. The Archer card (or at least the EMIYA one) is probably not even a Shirou from that world's future.     That's not a terrible question. Truth is though Prisma leaves you with a lot of stuff like that. If we got a full color shot of Sakura we might know if the worm stuff still happened if her hair was purple.    No shit, the card is just the EMIYA we knew, just like the Saber card is the Saber we knew from the other world. Whatever those cards are they can tap into the Throne a bit to pull out a hero copy.  This is already an entirely different worldline where Shirou grew up very different. He's not the same as Archer, and didn't grow up the same.      Don't be obtuse He becomes the Heroic Spirit contained in the Archer card. The Ainsworths have said as much while they were getting buttmad about dealing with Kuro     Before leaving the gun</span> Missing the point</span> Holy shit, I am done.      Is Prisma Archer basically Satsujinki judging from his wrapped eyes and arms?    It's Archer after himself and Satsujinki went to drinking.    to</span> out*     Did they chat about their history and love life?    Its Archer Alter, just like how it was Saber Alter  All the Prism servants were berserk versions of the servant that were lost to their own power, Alter versions basically.       Citation?     Who knows what kind of things they had to get off their mind.     The Miyuverse Sakura is completely different. Julian said this was the 6th Grail War, so in that world, she probably did end up as worm fodder.     How strong would they be as a team?   Alter   Implying you can still keep up with it.</span> If it's after the guy already pulled the trigger you are gone anyways. By the way, you are not really keeping up with the bullet, you are trying to keep up with the one who pulled the trigger, which is not what Saber is doing.     There's still a regular Prisma Sakura (she showed up for about two pages in an extra chapter). We've yet to see if her hair is black or purple, though.    Clearly they talked about boxing.    But Gil can never be corrupt, how did he end up being split with his younger self and succumb to Grail mud?    you are trying to keep up with the one who pulled the trigger, which is not what Saber is doing.</span> See the Assassin fight.     Weren't those pages colored?    tl;dr nonsense  The fact of the matter is, Shirou *might* be able to recreate UBW, but it would be drastically different since he is no longer a sword.  There's also the fact that he stopped training, so even Fate Shirou can surpass him.        Unless I read a black and white version, I don't think so.     Would Regular Saber love an Archer that found his answer?     He had to at least put on pressure or he would have been obliterated by Galatine.</span> You're not making a case for Lancelot being equal to Numeral Gawain.  Stop wanking.       he is no longer a sword</span> Compromising his ideals to save Sakura changed his Origin and Alignment</span>     He had that conversation with SHIKI he isn't gonna have it again.   Rather strong considering what both can do. Shiki is somewhat of a skilled Assassin and Shirou can Snipe from long distances, not to mention they can hold their own in a fight when it boils down to it.       That's all the more proof  Gilgamesh can be corrupted, he was corrupted in F/SN as confirmed later, it just was not the grail mud that corrupted him. The grail mud cannot corrupt him as noted, human sin cannot corrupt him. It was his own human blood in that case.  The cards are not the grail mud, I'm not sure why you might think they are, so that doesn't apply.   In this case they aren't corrupted by the mud, but rather its their power running wild without the ego to stop it. Since the cards trap the soul of a hero in simply its essence so the power can be manifested. The cards are the souls of the hero, their power, but not their mind running wild until its reigned in. Gilgamesh is an exception as he could not be fully contained; thus even though his power ran wild, his ego could not be contained or subvert as it was stronger than other heroes, thus is split off from himself.  Gilgamesh split off because he was different from other servants, because instead of just running wild without ego he incarnated.            Even Gilgamesh has a comment about his power running amok when Miyu installed the card a few chapters back.    RM is based on the user's mindset, not entirely on their origin.  Why else do you think all 3 Shirous have different RMs, secondary?      That shit only worked because the blade was broken. It's not the same case at all.    He likes sports   you guys are bigger fags than the eva kids   Stated to stall Numeral Gawain for hours</span> Somehow is not equal</span>  It's not wank when it actually happened.       The first assassin fight, shows how her premonition works.    stalling him by running away isnt exactly being equal, either way gawain a shit    Running away</span> That was never said to happen, besides, if he even tried to run away Galatine would obliterate him. Stop making up bullshit.     Give me a hug.    tl;dr nonsense</span>  tl;dr fanfiction  You're completely making shit up.   There's also the fact that he stopped training</span>  Heaven knows where the fuck you got this from, seeing as he chats with Rin about how he's still trying to get his circuits functioning properly.  You're just making shit up wholesale and claiming that the novel explicitly stating otherwise is just wrong because you clearly know better than the author.              I know how her premonition works. You still need AGI to react in time.    You're completely making shit up. </span> Read the VN. It's fact that new Shirou doesn't have UBW and it was speculated he *might* be able to do it with enough training.  Heaven knows where the fuck you got this from</span> F/HA. He's no longer training after HF, instead being happy with being a househusband.  Fucking secondaries, I'm done. Goodnight.          No, you hug me first.    Fighting defensively is now equal</span>  I guess Ciel and Ryougi are better than servants now?      Can't Ciel take down Servants?    Maybe, but it's an uphill battle where she can only fight defensively.    ubw Shirou for me, Prisma just feel like a Fanfiction "cool-epic" Shirou.    It's stated that she can fight defensively against an average level servant.  Meaning, it's a battle where she has to put surviving way ahead of attacking or else it's over immediately. Stay on guard at the foremost, stay alive.  Against a weak enough one she probably stands a far better chance.       Why is Fate Shirou the best Shirou?  becomes a hero</span> follows his ideals to the very end to make Saber proud</span> his UBW is a mix of UBW Shirou's and Archers </span> Caliburn</span> Avalon</span> Gets to go to Avalon and fuck King Arthur forever</span> Literally lived the dream.          Isn't it the same case for Ryougi, even though her Mystic Eyes have the power to kill them?   <span class="quote">&gt;no sweater tag</span>  Why     Just go to gelbooru or something    Here anon, have some sweaters http://g.e-hentai.org/g/453746/9eb6<wbr>a85b45?p=0 http://g.e-hentai.org/g/465808/d222<wbr>c1b880?p=0</wbr> </wbr>    Sadpanda thread?

My last trip involved a girl being forced to give birth prematurely, and then her deformed fetus was stomped on infront of her while she helplessly watched.

Encouragement of Rape.  i dont know if this show should give me a boner but it does  i mean, stuff like this  is clrealy fan service, but they are in middle school!!     I was expecting a rapist to come out at any time    Only Kokona is.    Just accept that youthful women are alluring. When they say "sex sells" in america it's counter part in japan is "cute sells".  And this show does that in spades, cute enough to sex.       She's just already reached legal age m8   Everyone can mermaid now.   What a slut    no dog you got too many problems that refuse to be fixed      No son, she's a lady. So if you wanna call her right. A lady slut is correct. Don't forget to appreciate her body at any time.  Dem body tho.      Almost bedtime. </blockquote>]
