[ Okay, so we know that they're both shit but who's the bigger offender?<br><br>Also, post seiyuus who are superior while you're at it.</br></br>   Hana kana  <br> shit  <br>Yeah, she's mainstream as fuck but damn she really got the talent. See her performance in The Garden of Words and you'll realize that she's not that really bad. <br><br>Amalia Sora on the other hand is a different story. Her performance in Aldnoah Zero and Akame Ga Kill is just inconsistent. I feel like her Hime voice fits her much better. It's like a lower pitched voice of Yui Horie's. She's just being pushed around for roles that doesn't really suit her voice (as of now). Give her some time to be more versatile and she'll turn out fine. It's just that her talent agency is pushing her around too much without giving her enough time to adjust.</br></br></br></br>  <br> we <br>Fuck off.<br><br> post seiyuus who are superior while you're at it <br>You first, let's see how great your taste is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish she got more roles like this.</br>  HanaKana had to work hard to gain her popularity while Amamiya is just Sony's puppet.  <br>left &gt; right</br>  <br> hanakana <br> shit <br>Please don't bring your subjective opinion here, hanakana is famous for a reason</br></br></br>  <br> hanakana is famous for a reason <br>Yeah, because so many people like cutesy voice, which is fine in moderation but that's the only voice she ever use.</br></br>  <br> HanaKana had to work hard <br>And you think other seiyuu (not talking about Sora) don't work as hard as her? She got lucky she voiced popular/likable characters early in her career and when Osawa saw they can milk the fuck out of her they just kept the ball rolling.</br></br>  Hanakana just need more crazy roles, her usual "cute" castings are shit.  <br>I was just comparing the 2 of them and you suddenly feel the need to get all defensive? Fucking Aoifags are getting more ridiculous these days.</br>  <br>KanaHana is actually talented and her voice is pleasant to listen to. Amamiya ranges from okay to makes me want to rip my fucking ears out.</br>  <br>Sawashiro is the best.</br>  <br>Mah nigga. She's always a treat to listen to.</br>  <br>You're praising HanaKana just because you think she worked hard when her workrate was average before she became popular.</br>  <br> that's the only voice she ever use <br>What about Rize?<br>What about Akane?<br>What about the love interest from Kotonoha no Niwa?</br></br></br></br>  <br> her workrate was average before she became popular <br>Stop lying and kindly fuck off. <br><br>Seiyuu with the most annoying fans on /a/:<br>1. Yuuki Aoi<br>2. Sakura Ayane</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Akane sounds the same as her usual roles though. Didn't watch the other 2 so I can't say anything about them.</br>  <br> Stop lying and kindly fuck off.  <br>Prove it asshole. Show me how she worked hard during her early career instead of talking out of your ass.</br></br>  Sawashiro and Chiwa Saito are my favorites in terms of talent, but I do love HanaKana the most.

Next Destination is the best of the three.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kanade needed drugs to Sympho properly.

To be fair that's a serious fuck up that can ruin an anime, but you have to give it credit where it's due.</br>  <br>This. Vitalization was the weakest of the three OPs but I still like it a lot.<br><br> I like Meteor Light a smidgeon more than Next Destination but both are definitely a lot better than Rebirth-day </br></br></br>  Incredible tasty sharkbro doll. <br><br>WHERE CAN I SELFINSERT!</br></br>  <br>But Meteor Light is the best ED. REBAHSDAY has the same feeling of Meteor Light. Not saying Next Destination is bad of course, just doesn't have the same feeling.</br>  <br> remember when early on into S2 the geahs couldn't touch Maria and DMJii at all? <br><br>Things that never happened. Tsubasa was a match for Maria in fucking heels.</br></br></br>  <br>Kanade was willing to overdose on experimental drugs and fight so hard her body was failing her, simply to beat punk-ass Noise into the ground.

I played All-star Battle for months before it got localized.<br><br><br> I actually own a Vita so it wouldn't bother me that much, though it would be a shitty system to play a fighter on <br><br>Being able to main my waifu when</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A 2D fighting game or musou-styled game would work well. It most likely would be a Vita game though but I wouldn't really mind that.</br>  <br><br>These are gross.</br></br>  <br>Symphogear would honestly work better as a musou (due to character/mooks amount) or character action game.<br><br> Hibiki tearing through enough Arcanoise to cause frames to drop to single digits due to all the red mist </br></br></br>    So heard you're in need of some LiNKER?  <br>I wouldn't mind a musou (since I can actually play those, I suck fat monkey dick at 2D fighters), though I have seen a lot of other anons express distaste for the idea. I have concerns over the budget needed to model and texture a dozen or so arenas, as well as modeling, texturing, rigging, and animating 9+ player characters as well as assorted mooks, mini-bosses, and stage bosses. <br><br>A CAG would be the best option in my opinion, but when have you played a CAG with even three different playable characters, much less Symphogear's six to ten necessary playables?<br><br>I just think a 2D fighter is the most realistic option, because it allows for a good number of playable characters without the need for all the in-depth 3D modeling/animating/texturing/etc that would go into a higher budget game. Unless we get a random miracle like Hideki Kamiya or some high-ranking dude at Omega Force being massive symphofags, I just don't see a musou or CAG happening.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> pkg_ch05_death.png <br> it's actually called this on the website <br> the others don't have an extra word <br>Is based webdev-kun a Kirifag?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Best case scenario:<br> Agematsu goes to the skullgirls team and asks them for help to make a fighting game. They accept, make it, release it for two console platforms and PC, and make Chris top tier. <br><br>Worst case scenario:<br> Another cookie cutter JRPG with a storyline that retells one of the anime seasons that is a Vita exclusive that never gets localized. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Webdev is a Mikufag.</br>  <br> Skullgrills <br><br>Time to blow up Lab Zero's twitter since no-one bothered with Platinum.<br><br> captcha failed <br> captcha failed <br> captcha failed </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> gunner in a fighter top tier <br>Nah.</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't want a western dev working on it. That would never happen anyways. I still think the most likely outcome would be a cheap Vita musou game. I don't think they'd go for turn based combat or anything.</br>  <br>DMC4:SE has 5 playable characters with fairly diverse movesets, it's not like multi-character CAGs don't exist.</br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4sU<wbr>oStOg9yY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Jaypee is leaking.</br>  Who's your Dancing Queen, /a/?<br><br>https://d.maxfile.ro/jwucwibtpb.web<wbr>m</wbr></br></br>  <br>She was the dancing queen<br>young and sweet<br> only seventeen ;_; </br></br></br>  Not gonna lie at first I thought that the Dolls were pretty fucking dumb villians. But Red and Blue kinda grew on me. Yellow and Green are shit though. And I just can't take the Wizard Loli serious.  <br><br>Gary and Micky make a good pair, one's the brain, one's the brawler, and they're fun, unlike the other two who are like refined nofun ladies.</br></br>  <br>Webdev put kawaii at the end of Kirika and Shirabe's school outfit images, so he might add a "jii" to Shirabe's album art when it comes out.</br>  <br>She died like the dirty doper she was. Nothing of value was lost. Now we just need the FIS whores to turn to ash and Symphogear will be good again.</br>  <br> Shirabe hasn't jii'd a single time so far this season </br>  <br>I still kind of hope Carol and them become good in the end and nobody dies on either side.</br>    <br><br>So the only final boss will be that machine Carol was building?<br>On the other hand, Carol has been living for hundreds of years for the sole purpose of building that machine, once she abandons that cause, she'll most likely die voluntarily.</br></br></br>  <br>maybe the full songs absolutely, but TV size I like Vitalization more than Synchrogazer. Even more so if the visuals count towards the the ratings. Exterminate might top it both though after this season. <br><br>as for EDs, ED3&gt;ED1&gt;ED2</br></br></br>  Garie is a cunt.  Is captcha broken for anyone else?<br>Getting mistyped captcha errors all the time with already accepted image captchas.<br><br><br>I wonder if Garie has a cunt.<br>Probably not, considering Carol is a genderless homunculus. She probably has already forgotten what it looks like down there.</br></br></br></br></br>  Testing word captcha.  <br>captcha is absolutely shitting itself atm. I'm on my sixth attempt to post this message<br><br>I want to like Garie, I do, but I cannot stand those nasally obaa-chan voices</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe actually Carol's last body was Hibike's father.<br><br>Carol is Bikki's dad after all.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Too bad, I love her voice. But I also like Satomi Arai.<br><br>I wonder if it's captcha's fault or 4chanX's fault.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't try to like any of dolls because they don't have even 1% chance to survive in GX.</br>  <br>Just drill a hole in her pelvic region and jam an onahole in her.</br>  <br> can't appreciate the dead <br>I bet you're apathetic toward Kanade, faggot.</br></br>  <br>Kanade is always alive in my heart.<br>Fine too.</br></br>  <br><br>That wouldn't be any fun for her, at least connect it to her brain so she gets some orgasms too.</br></br>  <br>Gary + Onahole + Alchemy = ????</br>  <br>Well, she's got a mouth.</br>  <br> connect it to her brain so she gets some orgasms too. <br>God, that sort of thing's hot as fuck in doujinshi. Shared senses is too kinky.</br></br>  <br>Good luck and Godspeed.</br>  So, Gairefag and Anti-Mariafag, which are the worst fanbase of Symphogear?  <br>Kanadefags.</br>  <br>Gariefags are fine people with excellent taste. I have no problem with existence.<br>Anti-Mariafags need to get used to the new reality of Maria being cool and useful.<br> Kanadefag 4 lyfe. </br></br></br>  <br>Anti-Maria<br><br>Personally I've found vocal hatebases to almost always be more annoying than vocal fanbases<br><br>They just shit on other peoples' fun to get their rocks off, while a vocal fanbase rarely puts serious effort into putting other characters down beyond 'my favorite char is better than your favorite char'</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bear trap teeth haven't stopped my dick yet.</br>  <br>Worst fanbase is honestly the anti-yuri crusaders.

Though I really like Micha's voice as well. I'm not sure which is my favorite.<br>The jangly doll noises they make are also really cute.<br><br><br> Gregor Gysi <br> He is of 3/8 Jewish ancestry. <br>Close enough.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Just because others didn't like our version of JUSTICE doesn't mean it's not JUSTICE.</br></br>  <br><br>If anything Germany is the true victim of injustice. It's unfair for one country to be cast as the bad guy in both World Wars as if both sides weren't committing equally atrocious crimes.</br></br>  <br>I like her because she's blue and fast. I'm also autistic.</br>  <br>I like her movements and how she can act so cute after her kiss of death and also those clock-like noises are nice.</br>  <br>Well, on the other hand the immense debts we had after WW2 got cut in half and we received intense economical aid from exactly those people who fought us.</br>  <br>Yeah, the shit the allies did in WW2 makes the Nazis looks good in comparison. Firebombings of Dresden/Tokyo, the holodomor genocide orchestrated by Russian jewish bolsheviks, and Eisenhower's post-war death camps are just a few examples.</br>  <br> makes the Nazis looks good in comparison <br><br>No it doesn't.<br>It just shows that everyone else back then was as much prone to violence, genocide, and destruction as us germans. It's just that we were the most efficient with it, so we became the villians.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How could we add S3?</br>  <br> It's just that we lost, so we became the villians. <br>Fixed.<br>The US were the most efficient. Look at how many people we killed with just two bombs.</br></br></br>  <br>First add S2.<br><br><br>That as well. Our scientists worked on the Atombomb too, I have no doubt we would've destroyed London and Moscow if we had succesfully managed to get one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well to be honest the firebombing of Tokyo makes the two nuclear attacks pale in comparison.</br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128888888 </br>  <br>Do some research for yourself. In any real objective comparison the Nazis were the lesser evil. America should have allied with them to fight the commies, but that was never going to happen with happy merchants running our country. At least Hitler kicked those faggots out of Germany.</br>  I want /pol/ to leave.  <br>What's the point of having a containment board if they won't stay there.</br>  <br>This isn't really /pol/, it's more like /k/ or /int/. I wish we had a history board, but it would just be /pol/2.0 or /new/3.0 anyway.</br>  if this season is successful, what type of continuation is the best for the franchise?<br><br>I really want to see a spin off about ragnarok with the Valkyries being the symphogear and odi having a role similar to Genjuro</br></br>  <br> Nazis were the lesser evil <br><br>Compared to the Soviets? Maybe, they were bastards.<br>Compared to the Brits, French, Italians, etc? Nope.</br></br></br></br>  Was I wasting my time editing these? I couldn't find any covers without writing. <br>I'll fill in the rest as they come.<br><br>Fun fact: Tsubasa's cover has a very feint pattern in the background, and none of the others do.</br></br></br>  <br>Japs were arguably as bad or worse than Germany even before the war.

This is for actual discussion and speculation for the manga.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128774080 <br>This is new Yu Yu Hakusho.<br><br>Complete with a Genkai.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128774080 <br><br>Like clockwork.<br><br>Anyone, anyone willing to pitch this series to me? What's the major appeal? Characters, worldbuilding, plot, creative fights, etc.</br></br></br></br>  I wonder if Bakugou will show up too.  <br>You need to give us more to work with if you want discussion, OP. Give a scenario or question. <br><br>Like what do you think happened between todoroki and his mother during his visit with her that let him come to terms with his firey side?</br></br></br>  <br>cool character designs, powers, great fights. the characters are easy to love. It has potential.</br>  Okay, give Deku a sidekick, gotta be someone we've seen. Who would offer the best dynamic and quirk combos  <br>Maybe Gran Torino could be his sidekick. Or vice versa.</br>  <br>One of Hiroshoki's strong points is his character design. Although their personalities contain some standard shounen cliches, their interactions with each other feel very natural.</br>  <br>"has"<br>its been 1 year, this one is a keeper.<br><br>However I think the plot is getting 2 fast</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's great. How does that sound or do you want the long version</br>  <br><br>Nah. If it was Yu Yu, we'd be seeing more bullshit power ups that appear from absolutely nowhere and redundancies out the ass with no prior warning.<br><br>So far we have had everything explained.</br></br></br></br>  How long do you think before Deku is better than Todoroki?<br><br>Right now I'd honestly put it at Todoroki &gt; Deku = Kacchan &gt; Crowbro = Iida &gt; Tentacle guy &gt; Tailbro</br></br>  <br><br>It's Naruto then. <br><br>Just wait for some sort of time skip and everything to go to shit. At least we had an early tournament arc where the protag lost.</br></br></br></br>  <br> le naruto meme <br>Fuck off /v/ermin</br></br>  <br><br>He already is. <br><br>Deku recently got full body 5% and can act faster than before where as he fought Todoroki with his self damaging attacks. <br><br>Deku could probably take Todoroki already in a fight.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Except fuck you.<br><br>Naruto was great as a shonen until we got past the time skip. <br><br>Before, it was about good fights with repetoires of techniques. <br><br>After the Saucekey vs Believe it fight at the waterfall, it went full DBZ and ruined what was a decent series. It went from what made it good into I HAVE A BETTER MOVE NOW.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Characters feel both fresh and natural, fights are solid and don't drag on. The series is also great at delivering on HYPE moments.</br>  <br>I still don't think so. Not to talk Deku down, but Todoroki is just a beast with any sort of distance. His Ice and Fire are fast and AOE. Until Deku can use super big shockwaves he's at a pretty hefty disadvantage</br>  <br>Bakugou is still the strongest in my opinion. His quirk is ridiculously powerful and the kid has the best fighting instincts out of all of them. Todoroki is powerful, but we haven't seen him employ much strategy outside of "freeze the entire arena" or when he blocked lida's pipes.</br>  <br>I meant it has potential to become a huge series like One Piece. I wish people would stop comparing it to naruto, I don't want MHA to end up like that</br>  <br>Maybe, I won't disagree that's he's super strong, he just really needs to chill. Case in point<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xGP<wbr>pmGTXKVs</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I am pleasantly surprised. Everyone tried to call Todoroki and Kaachan as the "hero gone bad rival" to deku but it's looking like it's Iida instead</br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree that Bakugou is the strongest. He just needa to chill</br>  Vol 5 Teaser  <br><br>Agreedo.<br><br>Time skip ruined Naruto.<br><br>I don't think My Hero Academia is gonna get a time skip though. Like the academia part is in the name, and he's only got 3 years of school to go through. Can't skip TOO fast.<br><br>Technically we're only ~1-2 months into his first year.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>is this the greatest manga of all time?</br>  <br> It's todoroki <br>Is this the end of the tournament ?</br></br>  <br>It's going to need to start catering to a couple more of my fetishes before it beats the number one in my heart.</br>  <br>unless it follows him becoming a teacher and then the principal</br>  <br>what fetishes, tiles?</br>  <br>In no way is kacchan the strongest. Todo of course will be able to out power him, we just haven't seen him use his fire side that much which was his weakness</br>  <br> as if anon won't notice it's todo  <br>Well then again maybe that's the point of a teaser</br></br>  <br>Classes in Japan start in the Spring. We already blew through the last half of his middle school year in 3 chapters, then we blew through all of Summer with the training for the sports festival montage. It's already Autumn, so by 100 chapters we'll be done with his first year, and be finished with school within 300.</br>  <br>Since the other anons have put in about the characters, the world building is actually quite good at the moment. Hiroshoki seems to really be trying to expand on the idea of everyone being super, even into the economic and political sides.</br>  <br>But that's just assuming he follows the same formula. Which he more then likely won't</br>  <br>Can't say for sure without knowing what kind of power ramp OfA has, but I think it's safe to say that 100% full body with a very good physique is completely broken. All Might changed the local weather with the air pressure from a downwards strike, and that was when he was already weakening.</br>   <br>i buy the japanese volumes did 4 get a release date yet? i didnt see it in the scans</br>  <br>vol.4 is already released, vol.5 coming out early August (aug 4 I think?).</br>  <br><br> has potential to become a huge series like One PIece. <br><br>There's being a fan of a body of work and then there's being delusional.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's a hell of a performer so far. If it keeps up what's it's doing with its sales/ranking it's on track to have some real legs.<br><br>The thing is what happens if it manages to become popular enough to hang on past Horikoshi's most optimistic end-date. Sorta why I respect the mangaka for Assassination Classroom who says that it's OVER at the end of the school year despite it being rather popular.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The one thing where BnHA falls down is the definition and clarity of wtf Midoriya's percentage use of OfA is and how effective that percentage is at being properly utilized.<br><br>Like, All Might was well past his prime due to his injuries and was still ridiculously, overwhelmingly powerful compared to even broken fullbody element powers like Endeavor and Todoroki before, and after giving up OfA.<br><br>He says he could've beaten Noumu with 5 punches in his heyday, but it took him 200-300. his 100% punches being half-dead, out of energy, and running on leftover fumes after giving up OfA to Midoriya completely fucking smoke the "100%" arm-breakers Midoriya can throw.<br><br>Like, 5% of All Might in his prime should have Midoriya sending Stain flying like 50 feet.<br><br>I personally interpret Midoriya's concept of "100%" being, "This is the absolute maximum output I have before I literally kill myself with the attack." Like All Might 100% output should do more than powder his bones, so I think his supposed "100%" is some fraction of the real power and he's mentally holding back so he doesn't literally blow his fucking arm completely off.<br><br>And this is before you get into the fact that according to All Might, every OfA user is stronger than the previous. Midoriya at his real potential max output should be able to level city blocks in a single punch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's also possible that OfA works as a muscle enhancer, and thus gets stronger as the user gets stronger. That would be why the scrawny Midoriya has less power than the giant All Might, even if both use 100%.</br>  <br>Even with great pacing, what this guy  says holds weight due to precedence of shonen battle manga. <br><br>It'd be wonderful if MHA subverts this and says fuck you to retarded logic that messed all the other shonen up, but the power of editors is always strong.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's heart.<br><br>My Hero Academia is a "traditional" (read: generic, but not in a bad way) shounen series. You've got cliche shonen tropes, trope characters, and lots of action. The whole plot is "MC gets a superpower from a cool guy and wants to be a hero". Plain as it gets, right?<br><br>But somehow, in spite of that, it takes these things and breathes new life into them. You'd think the MC is a scrawny wet blanket, but he's worked for everything he's got (and there's a reason people keep calling him based). The smug snake character is a complete and total asshole, and is framed as such, which makes it all the more hilarious when everyone trolls him. The "designated love interest"? She's a bro and can actually hold her own. The brooding guy's got his daddy issues, but he's a decent guy in spite of it and is actually trying to work through them. There're SO MANY interesting characters (and I really hope we get good screen time for all of them), but there are no Sasukes in THIS series, my friend (one guy's been going edgy, but the goddamn VILLAIN he was going after told him what a moron he was being).<br><br>The plot has been going arc-to-arc, with a training exercise to the sports festival to hero internships (which is now). But Horikoshi doesn't drag on. Something happens in EVERY chapter. And it's awesome.<br><br>The art itself is really dynamic and fun. And each character looks like their own person, to the point they all have their own individual type of eyes.<br><br>And on top of that, Horikoshi puts lots of little details in. Characters interact even when they're not the main focus, and their personalities really shine through. You can tell Horikoshi really loves what he's doing.<br><br>So yeah I'd really recommend it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So who's buying the physical copies when they FINALLY come out? I know I will.<br><br>And I doubt it's gonna sell out like it did in Japan, but how well do you guys think it's gonna do in the states?</br></br>  <br>I could deal of a time skip sort of scenario of it was more in the vein of a continuation series taking place after the storylines dealing with the school, after we catch up with narrator Deku in the timeline.</br>  <br>With the pace that it's going at though, I honestly don't see MHA going past the 500ch mark. And the worldbuilding can only go so far in a setting like MHA. It literally has the word Academia in it so I don't see it going past their school life. I think it'll be more in the lines of FMA, a good shorter shounen, rather than a long hitter like One Piece.</br>  <br>It's probably gonna be pretty big here.</br>  <br>Not all editors are bad though<br><br>WT's editor was the former OP editor and if you watched his interview he basically said "I give suggestions but he can do whatever the fuck he wants"</br></br></br>  <br> Anyone, anyone willing to pitch this series to me? What's the major appeal? Characters, worldbuilding, plot, creative fights, etc. <br>Capeshit: a japanese Interpretation</br></br>  <br> capeshit but actually good editon  <br><br>I started reading comics and capeshit when I was about 11 (2002) and after about 7 years I found manga and not many capeshit stories hold up to manga since I started reading abd MHA is a pretty good if compared to other capeshit</br></br></br>  <br>I think I'll actually buy the volumes. I've never supported a series before, so this'll be my first.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Thanks, sounds like it might be interesting. I wish I didn't start reading Souma just a couple of days ago, feeling kinda burned out already, and this might have been a better fit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The 5% Deku is not using prime All Might power, but the 1/60 All Might has left.</br>  While waiting for spoilers and raws, here are the results of the /a/ Character Popularity poll.<br><br>This was rather interesting. We'll see how it compares to the Japanese reader poll in a few weeks' time. Total number of responses was 74 for the character poll, 73 for all other questions. <br><br>Character Poll Results: <br>Deku took first place with an overwhelming 28% of the vote, 21 total. Tsuyu was second with 12%, while All Might was third with 11%. Shinsou was fourth with 7% and Bakugou fifth with 5%. All other characters received 3 or fewer votes, including Uraraka, Iida, and Grapes.<br><br>Surprisingly, or perhaps not given who actually knew about the survey, random translator on /a/ was the most preferred scanlation, with a whopping 41% of the vote. Viz was second with 31% (23 votes), while Fallen Angels was a bad fourth place with only 7 votes. Powermanga is still going strong, with 16% of the vote. I wonder if MAL or Batoto would produce different results; probably, since they don't know about anonymous<br><br>The shipper question, which was mostly a joke, had 31 of you (42%) answer "Maybe." More people voted for "I find this question offensive" than for "Yes" (12 to 11). 19 answered "No," for a total negative of 31, tying the Maybes. <br><br>65 of you, representing 89% of the pollsters, believed you would follow Boku no Hero Academia for more than 2 years. I guess it's long-term popularity is assured, at least amongst use pirating fags. <br><br>Link to the raw survey data can be found here: http://pastebin.com/ftn4rBHA</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Not even 100 people voted. <br><br>Sausagebra, /a/</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Iida only got one vote. <br><br>What did best boy do to deserve this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The first thread that it was posted in only had about 35 posters and got 25 responses. The second had more, but at the time I posted the link it had 33 or so. <br><br>Just how much of BnH General is a circlejerk, and how much of the low post numbers is because one was a raw thread and the other was Weekly Shounen Jump Dump, only you can decide.</br></br></br>  <br>I spend all my hobby time here and I didn't know about this poll. I guess it was a flash thread or something.</br>  <br>He should be glad he even got one. No. 13, most of Class-A, and Stain got nothing.</br>  What's with all these rampant shitposting keep appearing on Heor academia thread lately?  <br>Some people that don't have something to watch or read come to shitspot.</br>  <br><br>It's because some idiot keeps making the same exact general threads to make /a/ hate the series.</br></br>  <br>All might can do a lot more damage even when he's weakened than Deku's 100%. If the current OFA user is stronger than the last, then Deku might just be using 40% of his real power.</br>  <br>No, that would be  Hoshi no Samidare <br>But it's pretty fucking good, my current favorite series</br></br>  <br>Food wars is a good series too, but like you've said it kinda burns out after a while. Sometimes it will pick back up but then again a lot of times it doesn't. While BnHA on the other hand it's been great so far will little to no dull moments. (But that's for now who knows how it will be after 100+ chapters</br>  <br>No, that's xxxHoLiC.</br>  <br>Actually we aren't even in summer yet, considering that sports festivals happen in Spring. You can even tell from the way they're dressed.</br>  <br>That only really seems to fool newfags trying to fit in though.</br>  <br>Because naruto gaiden ended so shitposter is bored</br>  Espoilurrs cuando?  <br>Nani?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128785389 <br>seek help</br>  <br>This reply is a little on the late side, but there's official English release dates for the first 4 volumes already:<br>Vol 1: August 27th<br>Vol 2: November 19th<br>Vol 3: February 2nd<br>Vol 4: May 3rd</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Deku = Kacchan <br><br>Oh Dekufags are hilarious. Katsuki destroys Deku stop wanking.</br></br></br>  <br>City blocks is too weak. <br><br>Give him more power</br></br></br>  <br>Within the next 15 hours.</br>  <br>Deku literally spared Bakugou's life once.And now he can move like him, I wouln't be so sure.</br>  <br>The first time they fought, Bakugo wasn't taking him seriously he just wanted to blow him up. <br><br>The fact that you're counting that fight just shows how much you wank Deku.<br>And Deku isn't the only one training</br></br></br></br>  <br>But you are way underestimating Deku and I used that fight as an example, also I didn't say Deku would win. And even if Baku is training, which we don't know, we can't tell if he improves as fast as Deku. Knowing the hard time Bakugou had dealing with Deku and saying that he wouln't stand a chance makes no sense at all.</br>  <br>dentro de 5 minutos.</br>  The full volume 5 cover is out.  <br>when will hiroshiki learn to draw hands?</br>  <br>You. You are my nigga.</br>  Which Teenage Mutant Ninja Stain are you?  <br> every OfA user is stronger than the previous <br>I never took OfA description to mean that<br>I figured they were just treating it like a sacred torch and that's it, just not letting it burn out and keeping it burning at it's brightest<br>not that they were constantly increasing its power</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure volume 1 comes out on August 4th<br><br><br>That cover looks terrible, what the fuck?

One thing is for sure, Deku prime (hehe get it) going to be a hell of a lot stronger than All might in his prime.</br>  <br>I had forgotten about that pic</br>  <br> japan in charge of having not an ounce of taste <br><br>terrible times.</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry, I guess it was just bad-timing and bad threads.</br>  My biggest fear is that Boku No Hero Acadamia is what Pierrot plans to do once the Naruto Anime ends, and the reason they are still having filler in naruto despite it being done is so they can keep it going until Boku no Hero gets enough chapters to start.  <br>Better than Toei animating it. I'd choose the lesser evil.</br>  <br> I started reading comics and capeshit when I was about 11 (2002) and after about 7 years I found manga and not many capeshit stories hold up to manga since I started reading abd MHA is a pretty good if compared to other capeshit <br>I guess you are to young to remember that capeshit (no) american comics were good a long time ago.</br></br>  <br>Rabble rabble rabble underage fag get...<br><br>Oh christ wait.<br><br>Oh gods no, I'm old</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hope that Madhouse animates this.</br>  <br>David production.</br>  <br>I'll give you that, certainly.<br><br>Really, lets just hope a good studio does it, I don't know who necessarily, but someone (Madhouse is the obvious option, and they do seem to be getting a lot of popular stuff so we might get them. MAPPA could do a good job, but I dont think they want to do anything that isnt strange in some way. BONES could do a good job, although, they do ofcourse have a tenancy to create there own endings. Lerche might be a good secondary to bones, and they've proven they can do a great job with shows like [this season] and Assasination Classroom, although I do think they aren't particularly action orientated, so I dont know if they would be good at any of the battle scenes)</br></br></br>  If they are really wanting to push this as the next big jump series, its probably going to get a long running anime adaptation. I wouldn't be surprised if Toei or Pierrot does do the anime.  <br> David production <br>They could do a great job too actually, although I just want them to focus on animating Part 4+<br><br>A-1 could do a fair job too I think, they are pretty good, and there only real problem is an annoying amount of mediocre source material and stories.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>what about Studio I.G.?</br></br></br></br>  Spoilers in 5 min guys!  <br> Studio I.G <br>Oh yeah, sure, them too. Really nearly anyone but Toei or Pierrot and we're golden.</br></br>  <br>It'd need to be someone who can a) attack at a distance, b) restrict an opponent's movements, and/or c) mitigate collateral damage. Someone who can buy Deku the time and focus to make a thorough analysis of difficult situations. Ochako is probably the most compatible character we've seen so far: she has great potential for long-range strikes  tossing shit, meteor move , she can turn foes into sitting ducks at close range, and her quirk can be used to quickly clear rubble or stabilize damaged structures. Todoroki is also pretty high up there based on his skillset alone, but I'm not sure how likely it'd be for him to take the role of a sidekick.  It'd definitely piss his dad off, so there's that. </br>  <br>If it's the same cast that made AoT, then it's all good. <br><br>Don't let Pierrot destroy this, just like how they butchered beelzebub.</br></br></br>  I starter reading BnHA today and I'm in chapter 44.

You lie to me bitch azz nigga</br>  What's the general opinion on Bakugou? I can't fiure out if I find him annoying or amusing.  <br>He's an amusing bully character, but he needs to have more to him than the guy who makes Deku look good.</br>  <br> &gt;Horikoshi <br> &gt;bad at hands <br>You've never read any other manga have you?</br></br></br>  <br>His hands can be pretty bad sometimes.

It's spiraling out of control.</br>  <br>Kaidou a strong, independent yonkou who don't need no devil's fruit!</br>  Kaidou seems a lot more humble than he was made out to be  <br> avoiding the question <br>I guess that answer my question.</br></br>  <br> The Admirals are all super-tall <br>I thought they were about average sized from what I remember. Aokiji standing with Robin back at Enies Lobby, Fujitora fighting Zoro, Kizaru quitting after Beckman aimed at him. Super tall would be like Blackbeard.</br></br>    is Kaidou the same race as Oars?   still haven't seen Doffy without glasses <br><br>Why is this allowed</br></br>  <br>And a third one. Can't you see what you've become anon?<br><br>Let's try this again. Robin is 188cm tall. Now look at him.</br></br></br>    <br>No u!</br>   no one's talking about bro Fujitora   <br><br>These fags were just planning their little faggot plans about taking on Red Hair, despite Kaidou already fucking Kidd Raw, in drops Kaidou ready to tear them and Doffy a new asshole.<br><br>RIP in pieces Wizard of Oz alliance.</br></br></br></br>  So, Law vs Drake and Luffy vs Kaidou for the end game of next arc.  <br>You forgot Moria.</br>  Kaidou looks nothing like this.  Also seventh Shichibukai when?  <br>Look at this accurate portrayal of the Shichibukai from Arlong Park.</br>  <br>neither does big mom. and neither does most of the shichibukai when we first saw their silhouettes.</br>  <br><br>Luffy and law are bffs forever now and are gonna unleash the D all up in the new world.</br></br>    <br>Yeah but that was practically the beginning of the series<br><br><br>From what we've seen of her she reasonably resembles the one below Shanks</br></br></br></br>  <br> practically <br>We just saw Mihawk and none of those shadows looks anything like him.</br></br>  Kaidou is a fucking weakling... accourding to Law's talk.    <br>Third from left and middle look like him</br>  <br>sword looks nothing like his though.</br>  <br><br>yes, millions<br>now fuck off and got back to your bleach thread</br></br></br>    <br> Kaidou is a fucking weakling... accourding to Law's talk. <br><br>The same Law that was crying like a bitch after consistently getting out-rused by Doffy?<br><br>Bitch please.<br><br>To that end, I'm sure any retarded Doffyfags aren't stupid enough to even try to argue that Doflamingo stands a chance in hell against Kaidou, nevermind their retarded head-canon theories about Doffy planting some kind of bullshit mind-control device in the artificial devil fruits he was making for Kaidou.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>faggot</br>  Ah I see this is the release day cancer containment thread  <br>Oda set it up for the next time we see Doffy<br><br>He doesnt have his shades anymore so unless Oda does some ultra-bullshit, we'll be seeing his entire face<br><br> inb4 there's a bandage wrapped around his head that also covers one eye </br></br></br></br></br>  Blackbard looks like a fuckboii compared to this guy. How did he even make it to Yonkou?  <br>But Scopper Gaban looks like that. Pretty sure Kaido is Scopper with beast hax.<br><br> immortal from last Ope Ope user <br> used as experiment for the giant shit by Joker and Ceasar  <br> ate tons of false devil fruits to kill himself </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But Scopper Gaban looks like that. <br><br>please get out of here with these youtube-tier theories</br></br></br>    <br>Is Kaidou the same ancient race as oars/oars jr? wanting to die a bizarre hobby for one piece.</br>  <br> Blackbard looks like a fuckboii <br><br>well<br><br>yeah. He's like the Fuccboi poster child</br></br></br></br></br>  Why is the Sky Island held up by fucking baloons?  <br>HOLY FUKKING FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<wbr>UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<wbr>UUUUUUUUUUUUCK!</wbr></wbr></br>  Kaido came off as a sinister devil, now he kind of just comes off as a bit of a goof. I'm sure he will still be merciless (they can't undo him slaughtering Moriah's entire crew), but a lot less sinister.  <br> long pointy chin <br> shit eating grin <br> pointy nose <br><br>Are you serious? How do you not see the similarity? It was already announced KAido used to be in Roger's crew.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Last page loads in my browser </br>  <br><br>Hes gonna be a ¨I dont give a fuck I do what I want¨ type of guy</br></br>  Immortal..<br><br>So eating multiple fruits cant kill him</br></br>  <br>your criteria for who looks like who is kind of lacking<br><br>it's like you're saying Duval is Sanji because<br><br> blond hair <br> one sided fringe <br> swirly brow <br><br>they look nothing alike</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Chinjao, Kidd, Law, Roger and even fucking Zoro have all been stated to be merciless killers and it gets brushed aside once they become friends with Luffy and we see the gags.<br><br>Kaido confirmed for Luffy ally.</br></br></br></br>  <br>also<br> It was already announced KAido used to be in Roger's crew. <br><br>source?</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>nothin' personal Kidd</br></br>  <br>Blackbeard was always a joke.<br><br>Jesus is a good example of why Blackbeard is a joke.<br><br>Look how many times Sabo punched and kicked Jesus before Jesus said okay this is a bad idea to fight without any haki, I'm gonna haki up my arms now.<br><br>And Sabo used fire directly in front of one of Jesus's eyeballs and burned it until it became completely white.<br><br>Oda would be a hack if Jesus did not go blind in one eye from that attack.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  mfw the Oz trio will never get to travel the golden road with Dorothy now  <br>hax devil fruits</br>  <br>not that guy or even reading the arguments but we've seen Kid mercilessly slaughter people<br><br>Not so much for everyone else</br></br></br>  <br>The wizard of oz theory was fucking retarded to begin with. Get that arlong park shit out of here.</br>  we all know Kidds gonna be the Kiba to Luffy's Naruto; his imminent jobbings gonna prove it  he's from wanokuni<br>his tattoo and mawashi</br>  <br>remember when people thought Sabo having amnesia would be too fucking retarded?</br>  <br><br>Roger? I thought he died before Luffy even was born.</br></br>   that Sanji and Co part  <br>I have no idea what's going on, less because of translation and more because I can't remember what they were doing last time we saw them.</br>  <br>No one here watches Naruto.</br>  <br/>  <br>it still is<br>Oda is becoming kishi</br></br>  <br>he and Luffy will be friends until he does something Luffy takes issue with. Then Luffy's gonna get his ass kicked</br>  <br>remember when people thought Aokiji being an undercover agent for blackbeard was retarded?</br>  <br>Oh good, it wasn't just me.</br>    KAIDOU RECEIVED THE IMMORTAL SURGERY FROM THE PREVIOUS OWNER OF THE OPE OPE NO MI  <br><br>kidd is going to be luffy's whitebeard, except more ambitious</br></br>  <br> luffy's whitebeard <br>thats law</br></br>  <br>And remember all the people who said Sanji was gonna get captured by Big Mam?</br>  <br>and the time people thought Doflamingo was actually going to impel down?</br>  <br>no Kid is obsessive and nutso<br><br>He's going to be the Shiki to Luffy's Roger<br><br>Law will be the Whitebeard</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good times, good times. Reminds me of the time people thought Uroge was chilling with Enel</br>  <br>Yeah, Kidd is confirmed weakest Supernova as well.<br><br>Lost an arm to Big Mom and requested help from Appo and Hawkins.<br><br>Appo is alpha so he doesn't need help from people but Kidd needs allies to survive.<br><br>Kidd deserves to be the first Supernova to retire from the New World.<br><br>There has to be winners and losers in the Supernova and Kidd will be the first loser.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Roger and whitebeard fought a lot. Luffy and law will probably never fight with each other outside of gags.</br></br></br>  <br>Sanjifags are delusional.<br><br>They kept saying Sanji will cook for Big Mom in order to let everyone go but Sanji was never important enough to do something like that.</br></br></br>  <br>Law=Whitebeard shit doesn't hold up anymore since Luffy and Law made an alliance.</br>  <br>Kid's been hyped to much to go down quickly<br><br>it'll probably be Drake<br><br><br>they dont have to be a perfect mirror, anon. But even Whitebeard and Roger used to chill together</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Appo has common sense so Appo will actually run away from Kaidou.<br><br>Kidd is too cocky so he will stay to confront Kaidou.<br><br>Hawkins is incapable of doing anything or making any choice without enough time to read his fortune cards.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Luffy and Kaido cross paths <br> everyone expects them to duke it out <br> some gag occurs and they both laugh <br> become best friends </br></br></br></br>  <br>or that time people where people thought Gecko Moria is coming back to kill Kaidou</br>  <br>Luffy vs. Blackbeard redux</br>  <br>see<br><br><br>Assuming they both have long lives ahead of them. There's plenty of time for animosity to grow or for Law to want something Luffy wont let him have</br></br></br></br>  <br>He has the same face, though</br>  <br> Kaido confirmed for Luffy ally. <br>They will be besties after Kaido finds out that Luffy beat Doffy for him and captured the unreliable fart logia scientist.</br></br>  <br>Who knows maybe after they go their separate ways they'll get into a conflict at some point in the future. I'm not saying they will have a death match but it'l be like a ¨you know I'll have to kick your ass right now for this, right?¨ ¨ok, this will be fun¨</br>  <br>Its almost like anons love coming up with retarded ass theories that keep getting blown the fuck out; like that one where Capone gets kidnapped by a close orbiting moon</br>  <br> There's plenty of time for animosity to grow or for Law to want something Luffy wont let him have <br>I highly doubt that with all the shit they've been through and the fact that Luffy just fulfilled what Law's been working towards for the past 10+ years.</br></br>  <br> Appo has common sense so Appo will actually run away from Kaidou. <br>but before making him mad</br></br>  <br>Well assuming Law is still going after One Piece, they have to fight over it eventually</br>  Lola's mom will appear  <br> but before making him mad <br>as expected of the Roar of the Sea</br></br>  If he's unkillable then the fight will end up as One Piece's version of Pain.<br> Don't be such an asshole <br> Ok </br></br>  <br>But it's true. Almost every scene of Appo has him running away.</br>  Honestly I don't care to much for Kaidou's new design. The fact that he is rumored to be the strongest person use to be intriguing, but now it's "well yeah of course, just like at him."  <br>Holy shit, I don't realized Hancock already being foreshadowed at thriller bark.</br>  <br>But Pain was killable</br>  <br><br>Law's character arc basically said he only had one life goal and that was getting doffy. Everything else was just a pretense or means to that end. Now that it's done law has nothing else to do except fuck around with luffy and his heart crew</br></br>  <br>I think he's gonna go after One Piece with Luffy, not against. With the way he smiled when Luffy said he's gonna be Pirate King, I think he was more accepting of that idea than not.</br>    <br>Do you know what chapter they talk about his conflict with Big Mom?</br>  <br>Isn't Apoo the guy who tried to take an admiral by himself?<br><br>If anything he's the biggest retard out of the three.</br></br></br>  I'm so glad the rumors about Sanji being dead all turned out to be false  for now   <br> Implying it's not Big Mom </br>  Sanji is going to job soon. Don't get excited.  <br><br><br>Honestly I feel that something like is going to happen. They fight, Luffy says some nonsense about how a man's dream never dies, and that Kaidou should stop trying to kill himself because dreams. After that they become friends.</br></br></br>  <br>That wasn't the part of the fight I was getting at.</br>  <br><br><br>I dunno. There's still the chance he's going after it alone</br></br></br>  <br> Mr.Kaidou and the retards three </br>  <br><br>Can you shits stop comparing One Piece to Naruto. <br> fucking Kid = Kiba <br> Kaido = Pain <br>Holy shit. Kill yourselves please.</br></br></br></br></br>  So the Kaido henchman had the Bone Bone Fruit / Hone Hone no Mi, right?  Poor moria couldn't do nothing to that luck but what if he takes Kaidou's shadow and put it inside him? who wins  <br>why kill ourselves while you, the asspained autist, lives on? Seems like we'd be doing the world a great disservice</br>  So we an all agree that Urouge was pretty based this chapter right?  <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/Ancwu_9KFTk  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I used a famous example that doesn't happen too often where the big bad is literally taken down by a moral speech. It was relevant, suck a dick.</br>  <br>It's totally different</br>  I really liked what the Kaidou intro did though. It solved a lot of problems with the story for me. For one, it showed that these magical super-pirates can occasionally lose battles. Secondly, it showed that the WG doesn't just let the yonkou do whatever they want - Kaido has been imprisoned multiple times.      <br> Urouge was pretty based this chapter <br><br>all he did was watch some nutjob hop off an island<br><br>literally sat there and prayed.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>He has never been imprisoned.<br><br>The ships to Impel Down all sank before they reached there.<br><br>And if Kaidou wants to die so badly, why doesn't he fight Magellan.</br></br></br></br></br>  I prefer the CP0 spoiler rather than this Kaidou reveal.<br><br>I feel CP0 is more relevant in this arc compared to Kaidou since we saw CP0 and they are suppose to be arriving to Dressrosa soon.</br></br>  <br>Kaido's massive army would solve that problem.<br>The main problems would be based around Shanks since he's pretty fucking normal with what looks like a small crew.</br></br>  <br> I used a famous example that doesn't happen too often where the big bad is literally taken down by a moral speech <br>Thinking Luffy gives a fuck about morals enough to talk-no-jitsu anyone. If Kaido pisses him off he'll just tell him he's being a fucktard and try and beat him up, that's it. If he befriends him, then it'll probably be through stupid jokes, food, or a common cause. None of that moral crap. This isn't Naruto, so a pain situation won't fucking happen. Stop comparing the two series when they approach things completely differently.</br></br>  <br>As is the job of a Priest.</br>  <br>It's more th at he's trying to find these non definite ways that may be able to kill him.<br>So while he wouldn't jump into a volcano or swallow a pill of cyanide he'd jump off of a sky island or try to tank an asteroid or fight someone.</br></br>  <br> &gt;side character </br>  1. if his immortality is Devil fruit based. why not just eat another one.<br>2. if its not devil fruit based. why not eat 2 of them<br>3. If he is supposedly SO FUCKING STRONG how was he captured so many times?</br></br>  So who beat kaido those 7 times?<br>White beard and shanks?</br>  Kaido looks a lot cooler than I ever figured he would. How fucking strong does Shanks have to be to intimidate him into not attacking Whitebeard who was clearly stronger than Kaidou even in old age and poor health.  <br>yep. Nothing especially based about it<br><br>Buddhists gonna Buddh</br></br></br>  <br> Stop comparing the two series <br>But I'm not, you're the retard comparing the series. I'm comparing the Pain fight and the eventual Kaido fight.</br></br>  <br>3. Probably because he wants to die. So he got captured on purpose but escaped by accident.</br>  <br>Did Oda just imply that Kaidou managed to destroy seastone since Marines always capture pirates with seastone cuffs all the time but Kaidou always breaks free so that means seastone doesn't work on Kaidou.</br>  Fuck Kaido. seems like a gag bullshit with 'suacide' being his hobby. if you try hard enough it should be easy.<br>"Hmmmm I wana die, why not pick a fight with Mihawk, he seems like the type of guy who would take the challenge"</br>  <br> 1. if his immortality is Devil fruit based. why not just eat another one. <br><br>luck conspires to send him nothing but fake DFs<br><br> 2. if its not devil fruit based. why not eat 2 of them <br><br>see above<br><br> 3. If he is supposedly SO FUCKING STRONG how was he captured so many times? <br><br>he wanted the Marines to execute him so he let himself be caught or stopped giving a fuck BECAUSE no one can do shit to him</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Roger is weaker than Kaidou.<br><br>Normal marines with normal bodies and a generic looking uniform managed to execute Roger in Logue town.<br><br>You would think their spears would break upon contact with Roger's skin but these weak nameless generic marines managed to successfully execute Roger on the very first try.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe he doesnt have a fruit so they didnt use cuffs on him.</br>  Kaido's design is shit, I've seen fanart that was better<br>That said he feels like a great guy from the little we've seen of him</br>  <br>Don't know. dont have a fucking clue how it works. by my understanding if you can simply have some wiggle room you should be able to still use your DF if they aren't tight shakles. or what about clothing? does Seastone give off an aura?</br>  <br>Could have possibly been both. Depending on how old he is, maybe even a small chance Roger too?</br>  <br>Im also making a stupid assumption that its 1 person per defeat, so roger white beard shanks and maybe garp?</br>  <br>Where the fuck is everyone getting this "Luck" from? like its a guarentied thing? it seems more like he just has a uncontrollable hardening Haki</br>  <br>I don't think Kaidou has a fruit since the marine ships that captures him always sank and drowning is an easy way to die yet Kaidou seems to escape from drowning all the time.</br>  I wish it wasn't Kaidou, so that his "can't die/lucky as fuck" anm could go to usopp  <br>he probably told him he heard there was a beast a couple islands over that could kill him</br>  <br> Kaido's design is shit, I've seen fanart that was better <br>Please link. If the fanart is shittier than you have to seppuku yourself for lying.</br></br>   why do people call me kaido? <br> my real name is Kai D. O. </br>  <br>luffys not like naruto, if kaido tells him that his dream is to die he will say go for it, if its your dream</br>  <br>He jumped off skypiea, I think that's enough to show it's extremely difficult to kill him.</br>  <br>Didnt mean to link to<br><br>Just used it to open the reply tab and forgot to erase the link</br></br></br>  Why do people still read this crap? Even bleach and Naruto are better  <br> I'm comparing the Pain fight and the eventual Kaido fight. <br>Why make shitty comparisons when you know they're not gonna be the same anyway.</br></br>   that entirely obvious "No I don't want to be Queen" set-up <br><br>ID'S FUCKIN HABBENING AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT</br></br>  <br>Garp definitely, if he's been captured and tried for execution so many times I don't really know who else could or would do it. <br><br> inb4 Sengoku <br>Have you ever seen him ever do anything apart from the war where he had no choice?</br></br></br></br>  <br>More then likley just a really really tough Haki. only logical explination. Gulitones don't just break on your neck. especially if you are seastoned. Yet seastone has no effect on Haki as i can see it</br>  <br> big bad <br> beaten by words <br><br> big bad is invincible <br> only way to "beat" him (judging by current information) is by words <br><br>Are you autistic?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What?</br>  <br> Have you ever seen him ever do anything apart from the war where he had no choice? <br>I'll take, Sengoku not being insta spawned into fleet Admiral and working his way there for $500 Jerry</br></br>  Is that Mr. Prince Sanji finally or regular gay Sanji?  <br>So Kaido doesn't look like a monster? That's disappointing</br>  <br>Outside of a phoenix, only one other "unkillable" legendary creature comes to mind.<br><br>The Hydra.<br><br>It might be devil fruit unrelated though.</br></br></br></br></br>  Look more like green bull tbh.  <br> Where the fuck is everyone getting this "Luck" from? <br><br>did you read the chapter? Its not just physical things that affect him</br></br></br>  <br>Seastone does drain energy though. I'd be surprised if it's possible to have strong CoA in that situation.</br>  <br>dat metal arm</br>  <br> Kai D. O. <br> O = 王 = King <br> Kaido, King of the Beasts </br></br></br>  <br> only way to "beat" him (judging by current information) is by words <br>You honestly think Luffy is going to beat a big bad with words, instead of finding a way to defeat him like he always does? Are you fucking retarded or do you not read this manga.</br></br>  <br> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List<wbr>_of_legendary_creatures_by_type#Luc<wbr>k_and_wealth</wbr></wbr> <br>Apparently this is a thing.<br> Dwarf <br> Genie <br> Leprechaun <br> Sigbin <br> Yaksha / Yakshini <br> Sarimanok </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So why does O=王?</br>  <br> 30 <br> So who beat kaido those 7 times? <br> White beard and shanks? <br>those were games of ro-sham-bo. Kaido has never been defeated in a real fight</br></br></br></br>  <br>People like you make me want to hate Fucking Mr.Prince.</br>  Gonna say that the previous owner of the ope ope no mi used the immortal surgery on kaido and law will have to do some shit to reverse it  <br> implying she isnt going to become Dressrosa's Otohime <br><br>Luffy and co and whoever else will be sailing for Zou before Rebecca wakes up the next morning. Luffy's had enough of people hero-worshipping him so he'll sneak off while no one's paying attention to him</br></br></br>  <br>  If he is supposedly SO FUCKING STRONG how was he captured so many times? <br>He's very gullible</br></br>  <br>I'd say that's pretty monstrous-looking before the point of not looking like a human anymore honestly. It's pretty damn perfect for Kaidou imo</br>  <br>That would be nice, it would give his "im trying to kill myself as a hobby" a little more reason then hes just bored.</br>  <br>王 is pronounced O. Or Ō to be exact, a double wovel but it doesn't really make a difference.</br>  <br>He's certainly not going to beat him with fists and he's certainly had speeches about dreams before.<br>I still think it's going to be a case of Luffy being amazed by his fruit (assuming it's still zoan based) and wanting Kaido to join his crew.</br></br>   Kaido is just looking for a place to die <br> Whitebeard beat his ass <br> Shanks stopped him from going to war <br> Neither of them could kill him <br> Kaido just wants to start a war to find someone to finally kill him <br><br>That's deep man.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only if Laws dies afterwards.</br>  <br>I'm suprised the zoofuckers haven't descended on this chapter just yet, there were like three furries in it</br>  K-kaido?  <br>I could see Kaido being a Djinn.</br>  <br>So the reason kaido and shanks didnt fight is that shanks told him the wars pretty much over and everyone who might be able to kill you is already too tired to do so and he just gave up?</br>  Kaidou only wanted to give Moria's crew the gift of death, he was only helping.  <br>Every part of his survival makes sense that its simply uncontrollable unbreakable lv 9001 Haki</br>  I can't believe it... It wasn't a temple...  <br>Probably.</br>  Luffy is going to give Kaidou everything he has and lose. Then, just as Kaidou is about to descend on him, a lone bumblebee lands gently on Kaidou and stings him. Turns out he was allergic to beestings<br>how mad would you be?</br>  <br> chapter starts off with gambling <br> kaidous literally just abnormally lucky and that's why hes seen as so powerful <br>that's some good theming actually. bravo oda<br><br>   yfw luffy will win by being luckier than kaidou </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its one piece, guillontines can break on his neck if hes tough enough.</br>   last non-bb boss of the entire world finally revealed <br> he's another joke character that will do nothing but make fart jokes and dance with luffy <br>Cool glad I spent 20 years waiting for this.</br></br>  <br>Isn't Haki just willpower based?<br> Observation "I want to see everything" <br> Hardening "I dont want to be hurt" <br> Kings "I want Everything" </br></br></br></br>  <br>Garp should have honestly had more rank than he did because he's the only one chasing after Luffy once he started to kick shit up. Sure, everyone else at the time could fight and beat him just as easily but most of them just waited for Luffy to show up close enough to the HQ before deciding "oh, well he's close enough and punching out world nobles, guess we need to deal with him now"<br><br>I hope we see more Garp and Luffy interaction soon.</br></br></br>  <br>I doubt it, Luffy has a big D but KaiDo has a bigger one.</br>  <br><br>I thought he was a Sheep Zoan that was somehow able to grow his horn on his hand</br></br>  <br>he's lucky to have made so many friends :^)</br>  <br>it could also just be luck<br><br>he DID say his head hurt when he hit the ground</br></br></br>  <br> Kaidou sees Luffy as a strong adversary and wants to keep living to fight him so that he can die <br> tfw Law is completely useless against Kaidou because nobody want he does to Kaidou he'll keep living and fighting </br></br>  <br> Garp should have honestly had more rank than he did <br>They tried, he refused promotions.</br></br>  <br> Garp should have honestly had more rank than he did <br>Marineford baby? Garp turned down every promotion offered to him for the exact reason 'I can allready do as i please wih my current rank" Read the fucking manga dude</br></br>  So, With Geppo and Haki. is it safe to assume anyone Cp9 teir or above could do the exact same as what Kaido just did?  Why did Kaidou all the smile fruits? Making an army powerful enough to kill himself?  <br>Yes but from the looks if it they don't have much willpower lying on the floor drooling just because they're in seastone cuffs.</br>  <br> I will probably laugh if anything, but that'll be when I stop reading for a while </br>  <br>It was a 10,000 metres fall and he was completely fine<br>It's not luck, his body is just that tough</br></br>  <br>Only if its a dwarf that ate the bee bee fruit.</br>  <br>Roger was dying anyway so he didn't care about the execution (I guess).<br><br>We have no clue what's up with Kaidou though, maybe it's uncontrolable Haki, maybe it's a DF, maybe just natural luck.<br>Hopefully the next chapters will give more information about him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>you're saying kaidou is pretending to commit suicide?</br>  <br>He wants to make World War II<br>Do you even read the manga?</br></br>  <br>Ace could beat prison guards while seastoned. and he was a DF user. Id say he could take on anyone below mangellan and hanebell</br>  Luffy, Zoro, Sanji and Franky could all fall from Skypeia without using any abilities besides haki and natural toughness and be perfectly ok at this point in the series. I don't see what the big deal is.  <br> He's certainly not going to beat him with fists <br>We'll see about that. You do know defeat =/= kill in One Piece right?<br> he's certainly had speeches about dreams before. <br>And? Has he ever lectured an Antagonist about his dreams before? If anything, it's more in the lines of "don't fuck with my crew/friends". Luffy doesn't force his ideals or dreams on villains let alone his own crewmates. And the villains in OP rarely change their ambitions/ideals and whatnot that easily either. <br> I still think it's going to be a case of Luffy being amazed by his fruit (assuming it's still zoan based) and wanting Kaido to join his crew. <br>This is definitely a more likely possibility. Less Naruto, and more Luffy-like.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mate I know he turned them down, I just wanted him to not be some shitty vice-admiral which seems like anyone can be one at this point. I doesn't make me give a shit about them if they're all just expendable as fuck anyway.</br>  <br>still 'over 9000' haki should have prevented a headache. It didnt so my vote still goes towards Luck</br>  Why didn't Oda show Kaido's eyes.  <br>The design is fucking beautiful and he's not a fucking midget or something retarded like that.</br>  <br>Im saying the feat its self is accomplishable by alot of people. IF they are guarded. so its not exactly amazing that he survived the fall. someone ought to teach him about terminal Velocity</br>  <br> Roger is weaker than Kaidou. <br><br>Oh, wow, Oda sensei you are lurking /a/ and you are so graceful to share with us some information only you know?<br><br> anyway i think roger was the stronger person in the world, no fruit based, only raw power, at least, i hope it will like this. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Im not you Mate, Pal</br>  <br>his rank doesnt mean shit. you know hes a top tier character so what does his rank matter?</br>  The previous user of the Ope Ope no mi must hav eused the immortality on Kaido thus he cannot die these days no matter what happens to him<br><br>He will only get defeated if the current user of the Ope Ope no mi, Law, uses the immortality on someone else which will take away Kaido's immortality and make him defeatable</br></br>  <br>Luffy and Zoro, sure<br><br>Sanji? Maybe but I doubt it<br><br>Franky would straight-up shatter though</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This is definitely a more likely possibility. Less Naruto, and more Luffy-like. <br>Literally the same thing: beating him with words.</br></br>  <br> more Law shit <br>Just shoot me in the fucking head please</br></br>  <br>but he isn't guarded? unless he is pretending. so why even bring it up.</br>  <br>Not him but.<br>Roger was morst likley the strongest Haki user. Thats all strength is in OP universe. Willpower anon, Kaido's Haki just seems to be broken</br></br>  <br>He wants WW2 so he can find someone strong enough to kill him.</br>  <br>It's more a symbolic thing for me. I don't know why it bothers me, it just does. Don't judge me. <br><br>Ok, buddy</br></br></br>  <br>but that power has already been used on Shakky. Unless it was the user before even that one</br>  <br>I'm feeling that he just has broken Haki, like his body guards him regardless of what he wants. Oda has allready introduced schitzofrenia with Hakuba, pretty easy to make the jump, and makes nice foreshadowing for split personalities if cavendish shows up</br>    <br><br>It's going to be something similar in concept to roger's ability to "hear the voice of all things"</br></br>  <br>where did the shakky=immortal thing come from? because she looks younger than rayleigh?</br>  <br>No. It's really not. Pain was talked into thinking his life ambitions and ideals were wrong and changed his ways because of fucking moral speech. If Luffy befriends Kaido because he thinks his Zoan fruit is awesome, they wouldn't be fighting in the first place, and that has nothing to do with changing ideals or telling Kaido his dreams/hobby is wrong, no matter how fucked up it is. Luffy doesn't care as long as it's not getting in his or his friends' ways. <br><br>But I assure you, if Kaido does declare war and ends up fighting Luffy, Luffy will most likely beat him in a brawl rather than befriend him. Even IF he does befriend Kaido, it'll be after he defeats him.</br></br></br>  <br>That's CoO.</br>    <br> Pain was talked into thinking his life ambitions and ideals were wrong and changed his ways because of fucking moral speech <br>You mean he was beaten by words?<br> If Luffy befriends Kaido because he thinks his Zoan fruit is awesome, they wouldn't be fighting in the first place, and that has nothing to do with changing ideals or telling Kaido his dreams/hobby is wrong, no matter how fucked up it is <br>You mean he would be beating him with words?<br><br>Wow, it's almost like they're the same thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So much this, I knew it was coming but Oda simply refuse to stop sucking Law dick, and all those people who tought it was going to be a Drake centered arc.</br>  <br>can you fucking read?</br>  I think it's interesting that Kaido has such a big scar and yet cannot die<br>SOmething must have happened that caused his invinciblity</br>  <br> more Law shit <br>yes please<br> Just shoot me in the fucking head please <br>believe me I would if I could</br></br></br></br>  Westaboo no Oda does it again  <br><br>Law's fruit.</br></br>  <br>I can read the fact that in both scenarios the villain is beaten with words, can you?</br>  <br>the people's yonko</br>  <br> Kaido's Haki just seems to be broken <br>Again, what in this chapter is make you think it could be as you say?</br></br>  <br>at the very least, she's 40. That's assuming Garp was chasing her as an infant on a pirate ship<br><br>Does she LOOK like a 40 year old to you? She's likely Rayleigh's age or even older considering she was already a pirate<br><br>She looked exactly the same when Hacchan was a child https://<span>youtu.be/puIGppnqnjw?t=14m1<wbr>7s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> all those people who tought it was going to be a Drake centered arc. <br>literally nothing says it wont be except your headcannon based on what a faggot on /a/ said. kek</br></br>  <br><br>That's why I said similar in concept. It's some type of heightened armament haki that might be unique to him like rogers "hearing."</br></br>  <br><br><br>Only if Law dies for good right afterwards.</br></br></br>  <br> If Luffy befriends Kaido because he thinks his Zoan fruit is awesome, they wouldn't be fighting in the first place <br> they wouldn't be fighting in the first place <br><br> But I assure you, if Kaido does declare war and ends up fighting Luffy, Luffy will most likely beat him in a brawl rather than befriend him. <br><br>Here, forcefed to you nigger.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  law will make kaido mortal again and he will be so grateful he will become luffys nakama<br>screencap this</br>  <br> they wouldn't be fighting in the first place <br>So he would "win" the fight, as loss is being destroyed by Kaido.<br> if Kaido does declare war and ends up fighting Luffy, Luffy will most likely beat him in a brawl <br>You're fucking delusional then. He could barely beat Doffy, how would he beat the strongest man alive that can't die? Even falling from Skypiea barely hurt him.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I just hope there's no devil fruit involved, the man has a completely unrelated devil fruit and is just really really really fucking lucky all the time.</br></br>  <br>such a tiny head on a big body.</br>  <br> So he would "win" the fight, as loss is being destroyed by Kaido. <br>What are you even talking about? I'm saying there's no winning or losing since they'd just be friends. Do you think Zoro or Law "lost" to Luffy because they became friends or something? <br> He could barely beat Doffy, how would he beat the strongest man alive that can't die? <br>You're reading a shounen manga bud. There will always be a way. Luffy could go gear 5 or awaken his devil fruit ability or tag team with 4 other supernovas or the armada he picked up in Dressrosa, I don't know. And again, not being able to die means nothing in One Piece. None of luffy's opponents have died, why would it matter now? If Kaido can get hurt, than that's all that matters.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Again, what in this chapter is make you think it could be as you say? <br>Every fucking page involving Kaido. you fucking retard. every fucking feat is explainable with Haki</br></br>  <br>i thought he looked like new aquaman but I'm fine with the rock</br>  <br>That'd be really odd then, 2/4 Yonko would be without a DF, that'd just go to show how unnecessary they are.</br>  <br>do it, explain</br>  Kaido for next nakama?  So Kaidou is Zeref?  <br>pretty sure, after this chapter is 99% confirmed, if you think at the chapter number it's more confirmed than before.</br>  Is yu yu hakusho underatted or overrated?  <br>I liked it</br>  It's good.  <br>GOAT dub</br>  in between<br><br>cool fanbase. no one brings it up unless it's relevant</br></br>  <br>Kurama, /a/ is being gay again!</br>  <br>No, seriously, that dub was/is kami-tier</br>  <br>I know, I never see it being talked about on battles. I assumed nobody knew about it lol</br>  underrated. it's better than most shonen that's around nowadays  <br>Yeah most of its garbage. Opm and toriko are pretty good tho.</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>Overrated.<br><br>It was good but people say it was great when it wasn't. Just average.<br><br>It was definetely great for that time because shit writing was a thing but even know the shittiest plots could be good compared to old manga</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>now*</br>  <br>Being better than most battle shounen today is like scaling an anthill</br>  <br>Battle shonen today are better written than battle shonen back then.<br>Check first parts of JoJo or Hokuto no Ken without nostalgia goggles, check Saint seiya too. <br>It's garbage-tier writing. Goddamn awful<br><br>YuYu Hakusho at least had good writing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yusuke Ghost Arc <br>Nice<br> 3 Artifacts Arc <br>Okay<br> Genkai's Tournament <br>Great<br> Maze Castle <br>Kuwabara's Fight Good<br>Hiei and Kurama's Fights were jobber garbage to establish how strong they are<br>Yusuke's Fight meh<br> Dark Tournament <br>Pinnacle of YYH, you can stop watching here and it'll be a perfect memory.<br> Territories <br>Weird abstract powers that were suppose to make battles happen in a more non-combative way. Every enemies territory quickly just becomes some combative power that is no different than before. Yusuke has problems dealing with jobbers even after winning dark tournament and beating much stronger opponents.<br> 3 Kings <br>What the actual fuck is happening.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It really doesn't when you have shit like Chapter Black<br>Kurumada's Saint Seiya is total nonsense but it isn't as bad as Yu Yu Hakusho which tries to say that humans are the real monsters because of one percent of extraordinarily rich humans torturing demons in sadistic ways when most demons do worse things to humans</br></br>  How does it compare with HxH? Better or worse? I haven't bothered to check HxH out yet.  <br>YYH was mostly tourny arcs. I liked it and it will always have a place, even if it's mostly nostalgia that makes me like it, but the writing was nothing amazing. <br>I do miss punk protagonists though. Had a good run with early Beelzebub and early Yamada's seven, but nothing like the old delinquent protags of the 90's.</br></br>  <br>To Americunt newfags, maybe.</br>  <br> Dark Tournament <br> shitty predictable tournament done thousands of times by the likes of Dragon Ball Z <br> pinnacle <br><br>Sure, kid. Go back to /co/ and watch some more Toonami.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hxh? Couldn't even make it through the first season.</br>  <br>Why do you people assume everyone who disagrees with you about anything ever must be American.<br><br><br>You have some serious obsession issues.</br></br></br></br>    <br>The English version is made by Americans and only watched by Americans and westaboos.<br><br>Its dub also featured a Leprechaun-talking Jin, mispronunciations of Urameshi's name, cartoonish voices, and horrid dub changes par for the course when it was made.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I never saw Seiya and thought the first parts of Jojo were glorious, but damn if HnK didn't get repetitive real quick with Bruce Lee beating down those mohawk fucks. Entire thing was a complete fucking disappointment outside of the fight with Raoh and that air slashing guy with green hair.</br></br>  <br>HxH is better written and less predictable, but if you're just after a generic fun battle shounen, YYH is more suitable.</br>  <br>The manga is always on hiatus tho. It's a slow pace series.</br>  <br>Under, it's way better than HxH.</br>  <br>Nah, JoJo is still pretty solid.</br>  <br>It's nearly 33 volumes and the 2011 anime has decent closure. I wouldn't blame someone for not starting it but it's not like there's a lack of content for now.</br>  <br>overunderrated</br>  <br>Overrated shit.</br>  <br>Qft!</br>  <br> I only read two current battle shounen </br>  <br>True, I think I watched the 1999 anime. I'll have to check out the new one is it any different?</br>  It's a Murrican newfag babby's first shonen.  <br>It's got about twice as much content so that's a big difference. It's generally considered inferior in visual/sound directing to 1999 but it's pretty high quality for a 150 episode anime.</br>  <br>Nah, that'd be Dragon Ball Z.</br>  <br>Maybe 10 years ago. Today it's naruto, one piece and bleach.</br>  <br>One Piece isn't popular in the west though. <br><br>And it's still DBZ unless you're underage enough to be interacting with extremely young people. Right now it's probably more like SnK and SAO.</br></br></br>  <br>Well that's the thing, a lot of young people today are on forums like these are claiming naruto characters to be in the same tier as dbz, superman, etc.</br>  <br>I was speaking about ten years ago. Hell, longer than that since the first time I saw YYH was when it premiered on Adult Swim back in 2002.</br>  <br>Ohh, well 10 years ago was around the time dbgt was ending. So yeah more than likely that's around the time dbz fans were runing wild. lol</br>  Just as terrible as every other battleshounen. They're all trash.  Rin Rin is cute!<br><br>ZR Rin Rin is sexy and somehow even cuter!</br></br>   the only good show this season  <br> completely ignored by /a/ <br>Probably for the better.</br></br>  <br>Nonsense, the previous thread went to the bump limit.</br>  <br>I feel kind of let down by the last episode. I wanted to see the girls grow into and perform in their radio show. We saw them nervous going into it and then in the next episode they're signing off perfectly fine.</br>  <br>I know what you mean. They'll probably keep the pace like this too if Futaba will be singing and dancing eventually. I'm fine with it though, as long as they don't lose sight of their seiyuu career.

Why would you believe a guide to fluency written by someone who isn't fluent?</br></br>  <br>In what sense?

This doesn't make any sense at all, by any standards.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Where can i find anime girls talking about random shit that i can listen to while i do random shit?  <br> Each DJT contains 1 post that says "You Can Learn Japanese!" <br> Each DJT also contains 1 or more posts that contains ONLY the text "Fuck you" or "Kill yourself". <br>Go ahead and show me the ones in this thread then.</br></br></br>  <br>Passive listening is pretty much worthless, and even that schedule isn't going to get you fluent in a year.</br>  Has anybody moved on from DOJG? What intermediate or advanced grammar guides do they use? 日本語文型辞典?  <br> You should end up with a very high passive vocabulary and understanding <br><br>That is what you'll end up with. Passive listening isn't very useful, but passive listening allows for active listening at any given moment, and so in that sense it is useful. If you just have anime playing on your other monitor the entire time you're reading you can glance over and watch it here and there. It is always in your face.</br></br></br>  <br>You could download drama CDs from pretty much any torrent site to play in the background.</br>  <br> Has anybody moved on from DOJG? <br>I never used it to begin with and just read a bunch. Does that count?</br></br>  <br> Has anybody moved on from DOJG? <br><br>You don't "move on" from reference books, that's not how it works.</br></br></br>  <br>Did you actually do that for a year? Do you have your anki stats?</br>  <br>No I didn't, I'm not even the guy who posted that. However I do listen passively quite a bit after I noticed that my reading was way further ahead and I can notice the benefit right away. I don't think passive listening does all that much early on, but once you have a base it starts to work well.</br>  <br>How can you read and understand grammar without reading a guide to grammar?　This makes no sense to me, you may be great with vocabulary but in the end you will have no idea how all the words mean when put into a sentence.　Please explain to me how you came to understand grammar through just reading.</br>  I now realize I need to be studying grammar more haha.<br><br>Which one of these two should I do, or should I do both? I can't really read what they say.<br><br>Translate says:<br>Japanese grammar dictionary sentence complete works ( basic )<br>Japanese grammar dictionary vocabulary</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The reality is he probably misunderstands half of what he reads.</br>  <br>I read Tae Kim, and when I was doing vocab flashcards I always read the sentences.<br><br>Most stuff you people call "grammar" can be figured out by a lookup in rikai chan anyway.<br><br><br> being this delusional </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why are Japanese people so overcome by nostalgia?<br><br>Because  最古の記憶が最高 </br></br>  <br><br>ありがとう、出来るちゃん!</br></br>  <br>Not him but I've never read grammar guides for Japanese. I don't know any of the grammar rules but have no trouble reading. I just kinda know it just like my native language and English</br>    <br><br> Most stuff you people call "grammar" can be figured out by a lookup in rikai chan anyway. <br><br>And you call others delusional.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Have constant Japanese audio playing no matter what you're doing, even sleeping <br>That's sounds like a great way to ruin both my sleep and concentration and end up not learning shit in that whole year.<br><br><br>Nah, beating neets is easy<br> get a night shift job <br> listen to drama CDs during commute <br> do reps and reading on the job since there's nothing to do anyway <br> cram grammar on weekends <br> get money for importing reading material and eventual trip to Japan </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry, you're right. Maybe YOU can't. But smart people can.</br>  Is that 阿修羅 guy who read all that Masada still around? Was wondering what other VNs he went through and grammar guides and other resources he went about using.  <br> How can you read and understand grammar without reading a guide to grammar? <br>Not him, but I learned English without any specialized grammar references just by reading a whole fucking lot after acquiring basic skills. <br>I don't see why it would be any different with Japanese once I learn most of those fucking kanji, just gotta read for a year and I'll get it.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean primarily focusing on reading other, more advanced guides now that you've already read through DOJG thoroughly. I'm looking for some more advanced guides once I complete the DOJG deck and finish reading all 3 books.</br>  Guys, just wanna confirm I got my translation of this video's challenge (https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GE<wbr>mzkkftN70&amp;feature=youtu.be)</wbr>  [ ] (Around 11:14)<br>うちの猫が犬用のベッドで犬みたいに寝るようになりました。<br>うちの猫 - Our cat<br>犬用のベッド - Bed for dogs<br>犬みたい - like a dog <br>寝る - sleep<br>ように - now able to<br>Our cat is now able to sleep like a dog in our dog's bed now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Classical Japanese: A Grammar<br><br>A Handbook to Classical Japanese</br></br></br>  <br>What are you even talking about? The DOJG series covers advanced grammar, there isn't anything "more advanced" than it. And reading DOJG cover to cover is pointless, you won't retain any of it. You're supposed to reference it as you encounter things you don't know while reading.<br><br>If there is any proper answer to your question it's this .</br></br></br>  <br>You're close. If it was "now able to," the Japanese would be 寝られるように. <br><br>The sentence merely means that the cat now sleeps in the dog's bed like a dog, there is no question of ability.</br></br></br>  <br>The definitions in rikai are pretty much the same as they are in DOGJ, though.</br>  <br>Anybody?

Because it should be.</br>  <br> being this delusional </br>  <br>I think there's at least a few things that are covered in N1 and not in DOJG, so it might be worth going through N1 resources. But really the biggest thing is to READ MORE. No point obsessing over grammar resources when you don't have a general feel for Japanese to begin with.</br>  <br>Works on my machine.</br>  <br>okay</br>  <br><br>I don't believe it covers different dialects along with other things I need to know to read Muramasa or anything written by Masada.<br><br>My goal's to finish the DOJG deck while I continuing to read like a madman and quickly complete Core 6k. I'm almost done Core 6k and around ~150 entries into DOJG (I use the cards as basic review and also to jot down important points of whatever grammar point I've already read through). Right now, I'm just a tad concerned about what grammar resource to use after I'm done with the 3 books and the deck - Unless you're implying that I only need to search up unclear grammar points from whatever I'm reading at that point.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Right now, I'm just a tad concerned about what grammar resource to use after I'm done with the 3 books and the deck - Unless you're implying that I only need to search up unclear grammar points from whatever I'm reading at that point. <br>Japanese ones.</br></br>  <br>As far as I know the DOJG deck only covers the basic volume... Anyway, it will be severals years at least before you have mastered all the grammar in DOJG, if you haven't even finished Core 6k yet you are getting way ahead of yourself. Different dialects aren't really "advanced grammar" anyway, you will just have to pick up specific resources devoted to them.</br>  <br> As far as I know the DOJG deck only covers the basic volume... <br>That would be wrong.</br></br>  <br> Unless you're implying that I only need to search up unclear grammar points from whatever I'm reading at that point. <br>Yes, that is what I'm implying. Don't expect to go read Muramasa and Masada right away though. I say "Read more" because overall experience is more important than what grammar books you have read. Go read 20 VNs and then worry about Muramasa.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I know it'll take a while for each concept to actually sink in - Learning them on an initial basis and looking back to them when they come up in whatever I'm reading is what I plan on doing too. There's one that covers all 630 entries for all 3 decks. I'm just looking to prepare myself once I pass these steps - It probably won't take be more than a few months to complete the both decks (DOJG and Core 6k) at this rate.<br><br><br>Guess I'll search around.<br><br><br>I'll try doing that and begin to familiarize myself with more J&gt;J resources. Thank you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   there are people who are learning japanese just to read kusoge   <br>Check out http://nocozazal.co.nf/resources.ht<wbr>ml<br>unde the 教本 tab, you'll find "Dictionary of Japanese Grammar Series Complete"<br><br>the one at (https://www.mediafire.com/folder/6<wbr>z652dacw4vym/Grammar) only covers basic grammar, I have no idea why CORkun doesn't update it.</wbr></br></br></br></wbr></br>  こんにちは<br>ちんぽです</br>  <br> I have no idea why CORkun doesn't update it. <br>He is still working on updating the Intermediate section. Take a look at the grammar pdf and updated deck. There is quite a lot of work involved.</br></br>  <br> And reading DOJG cover to cover is pointless, you won't retain any of it. <br>Hence the existence of the anki deck. Anki helps with retaining things surprisingly well.</br></br>  http://hibiki-radio.jp/?radio_id=47<wbr>4<br><br> trying so hard to catch words that I don't have time to string them together into coherent sentences <br><br>I guess that this how you git gud, though.</br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>There are always alternatives to diving straight into native media for building up listening comprehension. Audio readers and sites like Erin's Challenge are pretty awesome. <br><br>It is possible to get better at skiing without forcing yourself to bomb down double black diamond hills after you've mastered the 'pizza' stop.</br></br></br>  <br> Audio readers <br>What's that?</br></br>  <br><br>It feels like I'll get this with a little practice, though. The number of words that I'm picking up on isn't anywhere near as miniscule as the last time I visited Hibiki Radio (which is a good feeling).<br><br>I just need to get used to how grammar sounds when spoken so that I can process is quickly enough to keep up with spoken Japanese, especially when the speaker isn't speaking unnaturally slow. This can only be accomplished by listening to natives speak.</br></br></br></br>  <br>My updated deck you're referring to this right? (http://nocozazal.co.nf/resources.h<wbr>tml)<br>I've tried using this search syntax ("deck:Dictionary of Japanese Grammar Series Complete" "Grammatical Concept:ところ"), cross referencing it with the PDF by inputting the grammatical concepts, I can't find missing sentences/grammatical concepts on any volume, well of course I didn't check every single one of them, they were just random samples.<br><br>What specifically is CORkun finishing? <br>Are the Basic and Advanced volumes completed though?<br>Will he upload it in mediafire once he completes it? And in case he does I think importing deck will update my deck right?</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>By* updated deck</br>  <br>What changes are you making to the grammar deck outside of correcting the typos and what not?</br>  <br>They won't make any. Especially not after the fit about not changing the order of sentences for ばかり.</br>  hey guys, I don't care about kanji but want to learn the grammar and spoken japanese. After that I can focus on Kanji/reading.<br><br>What could be the best way to learn grammar and fluent conversation?</br></br>  <br>Huge mistake, you will end up having to learn every single vocab word twice if you do it this way.</br>  <br>Even if I learn/write them in hiragana?</br>  <br>Real Japanese isn't written in hiragana, if you just memorize hiragana vocab you will have to learn the words all over again with kanji once you start learning how to read.</br>  <br>But at least is it possible to have fluent japanese and after that re-learn all the words just to write/read?</br>  <br>Yes, I suppose that is technically possible. Good luck learning anything above basic grammar though, any intermediate of advanced resource will only have furigana for difficult kanji.</br>  <br>Kanji makes vocab extremely easy to remember, though. By trying to avoid them you're making learning the language even harder than it's already is.</br>  <br><br>I used to be one of those "I wish I could learn Japanese without Kanji..." guys but now I'm in love with them.</br></br>  <br>There's definitely something about kanji that appeals to my autistic collector's side.</br>    李 すもも a plum and 桃 もも a peach strategy<br><br>すもももももももものうち<br>李　　も　桃も桃　のうち<br><br>onky hiragana sentence is hard to read<br>hiragana and kanji are easy</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Same here, , it might seem counterintuitive to learn something 'apparently difficult' when there's an 'apparent' shortcut but believe us, Kanji makes life about 100x easier. Take it from me, I find that it's about 1.5-5x harder to memorize the hiragana form of some words as opposed to their kanji forms, that's because the kana doesn't have meanings in them in the same way the english alphabet letters do not have meanings by themselves. Logographs such as Kanji are much much easier to remember trust me. <br><br><br> What specifically is CORkun finishing? <br> Are the Basic and Advanced volumes completed though? <br> <br>I'm also curious, does anyone know?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> My updated deck you're referring to this right? <br>This deck<br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/6<wbr>e5e5n4jd3es6c5/%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E<wbr>8%AA%9E%E6%96%87%E6%B3%95%E8%BE%9E%<wbr>E5%85%B8%E4%BE%8B%E6%96%87%E5%85%A8<wbr>%E9%9B%86_%28%E5%9F%BA%E6%9C%AC%29.<wbr>apkg<br><br> What specifically is CORkun finishing?  <br>Compare that deck with the complete one linked in the CoR. The complete deck was based on a spreadsheet which has many typos and in the advanced section has a large amount of instances where the wrong kanji is used for words. The new deck, aside really nice formatting and all the example sentences from each concept instead of a set limit for example sentences, has he formation table on each card with a concept in the book which has one. The difference between the new version and old version is rather stark. <br><br> Are the Basic and Advanced volumes completed though? <br>So far only the basic deck is updated and from a previous thread apparently the intermediate section is sitting at around 150 pages or something edited. <br><br> Will he upload it in mediafire once he completes it? <br>He took a break to work on a kanji deck but before that when he was working on the DoJG stuff, it was updated frequently.<br><br> And in case he does I think importing deck will update my deck right? <br>The fields and styling are completely different. I don't think there is a simply way to importing the deck while somehow keeping reviews from the concepts. <br><br><br>If you compare the new deck and the old deck CoR-kun is adding formation charts outside of the typos and what not. Nothing else in the archive has been posted to suggest anything aside the current format will be added. Who knows, though. He seems to post some new thing every few weeks.<br><br><br>Why would the sentence order change from what is in the book? Unless I misunderstand the purpose of the deck it is for reviewing the DoJG concepts as they appear in the volumes. That said, sentences have their own fields so they can be changed at will if you want.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br> want to learn Japanese without learning kanji <br><br>This is seriously the most ignorant shit.<br><br> I just want to watch anime! I don't care about videogames, VNs, or manga! <br><br>What will you do when the writers expect you to be able to read in order to follow the plot? Showing you an email, letter, etc.<br><br> I'm going to the country! <br><br>Then you REALLY need to be able to read. You're not a baby, with your mom standing nearby to alert you that you're violating some rule or going the wrong way. You're an adult. You need to be able to figure it out on your own. How do you do that? You read the signs. Or do you want to constantly get on everyone's nerves, and possibly get in trouble... or worse, get hurt because you couldn't read the warning?<br><br>The only excuse for knowing a bit of Japanese without having anything resembling functional levels of kanji knowledge is if you find yourself on a trip to Japan without decent warning in advance and need to heavily prioritize picking up on just mandatory phrases, and that status isn't justifiable for long. If you want to be proficient in Japanese, you need to understand their writing system.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I see, Do you use the deck with the same formatting it comes in?<br>I can see he made quite some changes but I wish he made a cloze version as the cloze version in the CoR isn't updated as the one you linked.<br>What do you think? I personally think the cloze format would come with greater retention.<br>e.g.<br>{{FrontSide}}<br>X~is <br>これ[...]本<br>ほん[...]・[...]。 <br><br>{{Backside}}<br>Filled in Cloze Deletions, other sentences <br>Where it has a short description of what the grammatical concept does and asks to fill the cloze deletions.<br>Or do you translate every sentence and hit again when you get one wrong?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd have to dig through the archives but I remember him posting that he was going to make another card type for cloze deletions after everything was updated. It must have been a month or two ago now. <br><br>It wouldn't take all that long to use the updated correct sentences with descriptions and make a cloze type deck. I could probably fiddle around with the exported deck in a spreadsheet and have it sorted out in a day or two. Can't do that until the rest of the stuff has been updated unless you go through and proof edit them yourself. <br><br>Agree with your idea with the clozes. The updated grammar descriptions would make it easier to more accurately understand the correct concept for the cloze.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm assuming that the Basic Volume deck is pretty much finished no? <br>I think I could just map the the updated 'usage' field and and the formation field using anki's import and mapping feature, what do you think?<br><br>Oh, for CoRkun if he might be reading this, you might find this helpful, although he might have to tweak the code a bit as it might produce funny results for double replacements with inflections, but it should cover around 90% of the work with only minor editing.<br>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/<wbr>31585019/advanced-text-replacement-<wbr>cloze-deletion<br>Also, the first column must not have spaces<br>i.e. ある (1) should be ある(1) for the script to work.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  who 童貞 here  k-on is objectively the best thing ever created alongside haibane and tex    <br>Hiding anon posts is pointless</br>  <br>Please get help, Anon. <br><br>We'll probably cross paths after this thread, but I won't know it's you.
