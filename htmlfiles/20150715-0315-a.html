No anime is worth funding anyway  <br>Explain how they bring a character into the show that was completely overlooked originally and how they FIX the alterations for the final arc in season 2.</br>  Locodol season 2<br>Yuyushiki season 2<br>Yotsuba&amp; anime<br>Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou anime<br><br>and A WIXOSS rewrite that fixes the problems of season 2</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>O/A anime<br>Mujaki no Rakuen full anime<br>Also yearly seasons of Shana and Index.</br></br></br>  <br>Holo's interactions with Kraft remains fresh and charming. There's new characters that add diversity. There's a fair amount of action and high tension scenes. I don't see the issue.</br>  <br>I only read the official translation, so I'm not done yet. But I don't see a problem with animating another 4-5 books.</br>  <br>For starters a Pokémon gen 1-2 anime based on the games Yellow and Crystal. 25 episodes each generation. Full shown gym leader battles with backstory and side quests like SS Anne (with theme included), Safari Zone, Silph Co., Pokémon Mansion, Cerulean Cave and Pokémon Tower in Kanto. It would end with Red beating an adapted league, like in the Ashnime but with the E4, rivals (Blue and Green) and other strong trainers, getting Mewtwo and going to train to Mt. Silver.<br>Next season would start with Gold, Silver and Kris getting their pokémon, fighting the gym leaders and showing the common troubles one had while fighting (Rollout, Fury Cutter, Kingdra, etc). Along the journey they would meet Kanto gym leaders and rivals from Gen 1, who would forshadow the ultimate battle. As for character development Silver will become a good trainer and eventually would team up with Gold to battle Lance and Clair. At the end, after beating the league Gold goes to Mt. Silver and Battles Red. After a long battle they are with their last pokémon. They both use their strongest moves while saying how good/strong their opponent is and the screen slowly goes black. A battery error message appears and then a NEW GAME option. The anime ends here.</br></br>  I would redo Oreimo as the author completely intended (not so fast Nekofags) with the better ending  <br> Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou anime <br>Oh, fuck yeah. There was an OVA way back when, but what I wouldn't give to see a proper TV series of it...</br></br>  <br> Yuyushiki season 2 <br>And seasons 3, 4, and 5. And 2 movies.</br></br>  <br>Monster Hunter Anime. No doubt about it. <br><br>Maeby some copuple of movies about kingdom.</br></br></br>  All volumes of OnC, Horizon, and CITY.<br> <br>Anything animated by Satelight that involves lots of music.</br> </br>  SZS ending<br>Jinrui wa Suitai ending</br>  I'd bribe shaft to never make Kizu and then post endless reams of smug reaction pics until I get ip range banned.  <br>but what if they run out of stuff to HooYa?</br>  Sora no Woto S2<br>Jintai S2<br>And if I have some money left, I'd use a roulette to determine which Dowman Sayman manga gets an anime.</br></br>  <br>Aiki<br>Akumetsu</br></br>  <br> Sora no Woto s2 <br><br>Finale didn't really leave the door open</br></br></br>  Prison School adaption that looks better than the manga.  SoreMachi S2<br>Haruhi S3<br>Nichijou S2<br>Nichibros S2<br>Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer<br>Uwagaki<br>Fujimi Lovers<br>Fujiyama-san<br>Sunny<br>Pluto<br>Voynich Hotel<br><br><br><br>these too</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Molester man anime.<br>Tabi ni deyou OVAs.<br>Haruhi S3.<br>SZS ending adaptation.<br>Hidamari Sketch S5.<br> Yotsubato anime. <br>Nichibros / Nichijou S2.<br>Full adaptation of Jojo.<br>Pluto anime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah just because you liked the show doesn't mean it deserves another season. SnW ended fine as it is.</br></br>  <br>You forgot to watch the OVA.</br>  Anime set in WW1. Starts out pretty generic, even some moe in the form of MC's gf/sister before he gets sent off to the front. Then on the 4th episode, MC dies out of nowhere. Nothing dramatic or heroic either, just a random stray bullet to the head in the middle of the episode. <br>From there everything is designed to be a huge "fuck you" to the audience. One of the MC's friends becomes the new MC for a while, but he gets killed off soon enough too, and the focus changes to another pretty random guy. As the series progress it starts going full Eva, with characters losing their sanity and everything breaking down psychologically.<br>As the series progresses, make the artstyle as realistic and gritty as possible. No stylization for dramatic effect. Camera shots are long and static medium shots, music is kept to a bare minimum, and the constant sound of endless bombardment in the background. The audience should feel physically sick from watching the show.<br><br>Ending is the 3rd or 4th guy we follow around losing his arm in an explosion and getting discharged. He returns back to whatever bumfuck village in France he came from, suffering from shellshock and unable to adjust to civilian life. He ends up shooting himself in the bathroom.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd hire A-1 to redo Archer vs Shirou and post-epilogue answer.</br>  <br>Jesus, dude, that's horrifying.<br><br> I'd totally watch it. </br></br></br>  A movie for this<br><br>http://mangafox.me/manga/koukoku_no<wbr>_shugosha/</wbr></br></br>  <br> Mc has a harem of teenagers and a loli he rapes on a night basis <br> drink all the alcohol <br> casually torture some random guys with your bros <br>man the japanese sure know how to live it up</br></br></br></br>  Weight lifter woman, tanned and swole as fuck. Anime will be sad and lots of feels towards the end.  <br>Even better would be the side changing every time the focus changes.</br>  <br>Maybe have the guy who killed the current MC become the new MC</br>  <br>Frozen tear drop</br>  <br>ket-ai</br>  Oyasumi Punpun  <br>My nigga. Is this manga really ended? Seems lot of stuff still unresolved.</br>  A Promise of Blood anime.<br><br>It's already anime enough to work</br></br>  <br>3rd season of Majutsu Index, although I wouldn't trust J.C to do it.<br>Maybe OVAs and specials for series that had an abrupt end, mostly slice of lifes and romances.<br>Primarily though, more original drama movies and anime like wolf children and madoka.<br><br>If possible I would also fund a business to translate more games, visual novels and eroges, since there are so many i'd like to play.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Despera, or maybe Doos Ecks.</br>  This, of course.  <br>Yeah unfortunately. I feel like they could have continued it for a while, there was a lot of stuff they could have touched on but didn't, like another offensive in summer if it happened, what the fuck those dragons do, some of the other ruling families. What I am hoping for is they make a part 2.<br>In the meantime I'm gonna read this, apparently people keep saying its good.<br>http://mangafox.me/manga/gunka_no_b<wbr>altzar/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br> Yotsuba&amp; anime <br>It'll be shit and you know it.</br></br></br>  I'd consider the following:<br>Etotama</br>  Accel World s2  <br> PunPun <br>That wouldn't even work as an anime.</br></br>  <br>Despera is getting an anime though.</br>  <br>Why not?</br>  I wouldn't waste money on japanimation if I were a millionaire, but if I were a billionaire, sure.<br><br>I would hire Urobuchi and let him make his personal dream project. Let him choose the studio, the director, the VAs, who'll make the OP, ED and the soundtrack, everything. Tell him the anime will be publicly available for free online so he won't need to bother about time slot, censoring or anything else. I'll just bankroll him to do whatever he wants to see what would he do.<br><br>I'm not a huge fanboy of his, I'm just curious what project he would made if he was completely free to do whatever the hell he wants, with no restrictions.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope it was because of low sales or popularity because of the theme.<br><br> Gunka no Baltzar <br>Yeah it's good if you like political strategy more than warfare.</br></br></br></br>  I would buy a small, rural Japanese village and populate it with 2D posters of the cast of Non Non Biyori.  <br>And it would be just as boring as the show.</br>  <br>Same reasons Catcher in the Rye wouldn't work as a live action film. And it's too long.</br>  <br>It was pretty much perfect right up until the ending thoough</br>  <br>You don't need to be a millionaire to fund that</br>  <br>A 100% manga faithful adaption of One Piece by Bones, Madhouse or really anyone that isn't Toei, and since One Piece is ultra popular I would make my money back pretty easily.<br><br>I would also relaunch the series in the west with some major marketing since 4kids ruined it the first time around, so everyone knows to give it a chance.</br></br></br>  <br>Bless your soul good sir</br>  <br>typo, 'it was not because'<br/></br>  <br>Yeah, I would just dump money at the door of every studio I liked and see what they came up with on their own. I would kill to see Trigger make a TV anime with a really good budget.</br>  <br><br> just dump money on creators <br>Terrible idea and rarely turns out okay.<br>Creativity thrives in restrictive environments.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You do know that as a whole, animation talent is price inelastic right? It'll just fuck up the entire market.</br>  <br>The people are more important than the money.</br>  <br>this is counter intuitive but also true</br>  <br>None. I would keep it all to my self and live out the NEET life.</br>  <br>And money can't help it? Seriously? I don't think so.</br>  The World Ends With You anime, for sure.

Christmas Cake Harem please.</br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty much pure war story, not pander to anyone, no heroine, no moe. Japanese audiences are hard to please.</br>  <br>Absolutely true.

How fucked are you? Make sure to post how fucked you are on each one if you have more than one favorite.<br> everybody in my family would be terrified of rachnee <br> they'd probably get along better with cathyl, since she's a friendly girl from the good ol' south. they'd just want her to wear something without all the cleavage exposure of her normal outfit <br> They'd all love Zombina. She's a tomboy who loves guns and action movies. My dad would geek out about weapons and the military with her, my brothers would watch movies with her all night, and my mom would just be happy I have somebody in my life. At least if they could get past the whole undead thing. </br></br></br>  To those saying there is nothing to Miia's character beyond her lust for Kimihito, let's note that she has a particular obsession with becoming "girly" in a human sense, be it the design of her room, her desire to play a magical girl, or her fascination with fairy tale romances. <br><br>There's also her sexual mores, which seem downright prudish compared to the society she was raised in. Her mother even noted she was considered "shy" growing up.</br></br>  <br>Moe</br>  <br>My mother would literally die from seeing Rachne, but I'm sure my dad would have one of those "I know exactly what you do at night" faces on.</br>  <br>It's really Suu's harem, she's just having trouble securing her bottom bitch.</br>  <br>Mero is really sweet</br>  I love all the girls. None of them have done enough for me to hate them outright, and they all have their character strengths and flaws.<br><br>But I think we can all agree that Rachnee is most seductive girl,  with maybe Miia's mom in close second </br></br>  <br>She's always been girly. As a kid she was shown reading princess books.</br>  The stream's at 11:30 right?  <br>is someone gonna stream it?</br>  <br>Yes<br>I would be kind enough to post a link, but I dont want the stream taken down</br></br>  <br>Yes, but she clearly struggles with matching her girly desires with her passionate lamia nature. Hence she keeps trying.</br>  <br>Are we assuming this is the first time they've ever heard of/seen a monster girl or do they already know they exist? I think my family would be mostly cool with Miia but they would probably tease me about it because   I'm deathly afraid of snakes. </br>  <br>They know that monster girls exist, and maybe they've seen one or two in public with their host, but they've never really met one.</br>  <br><br>Where's the rest?</br></br>  <br> I love all the girls. None of them have done enough for me to hate them outright, and they all have their character strengths and flaws. <br>Agreed.

She's an overtly sweet and friendly girl, and aside from the obvious aspect of being a Lamia, she would be the kind of person my parents would expect me to bring home and be proud of me for,  as opposed to some over-sexed skank like spider-butt. <br><br>My family has some pretty decent moral standards to it, but I'd doubt that they'd have any more problem with me dating a Lamia than I have a problem dating a Lamia, which is none at all.<br>If I brought home  a woman that had a horse-pussy  or  a Hapry or slime that had the physical stature and mental capacity of a child , they might start to worry about me, but I doubt they'd have a problem if the sole unusual thing about my girlfriend was her having cute little elfy-ears and a snake-tail.<br><br>In fact, my parents are probably a little worried that I don't date as much as my brother.<br>They'd probably giggle between themselves and whisper to one another when Miia did things like snuggle against my arm during board-games after dinner or subconsciously wrap her tail around my waist as we sat together.<br><br>The only minor concern I think they might bring up is that there wouldn't be a  grandson  in their future, but that'd be a very minor concern that I don't really care about in the future.<br><br>Great, thinking about this has made me sad.<br> tfw I will never introduce a pretty Lamia girl to my parents and watch them hit it off, or get to spend the holidays together with the people that are most important to me, including a beautiful Lamia waifu </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll apply some ointment then.</br>  <br>Preread the manga. Two chapters a week and you should be good come Tuesdays.</br>  <br><br>I think it could also be rendered as Cyanus(as in the colour cyan, pronounced "she-un-us"), but I'm not TF.</br></br>  <br><br>Miia herself is a close third in my opinion.</br></br>  <br>Pre-read. It lets you follow without the need for subtitles(barring any original lines added).</br>  <br>mero seems pretty boring though <br>I'm hoping theyll do something to make her interesting in the next chapter.</br></br>  <br>Loli form is just another degree of hydration. It's hard to say at what level she's properly hydrated, because under loli she rapes for water, but even at vavavoom levels of boobage she can still take in water if she desires.</br>  <br> she's the only girl that wants Darling's D so bad, what a slut! <br>Pretty much, yeah.<br><br> and even harder <br> being THIS delusional <br>I'd tell you to read the manga just the same, but that would be a fruitless endeavor.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She was willing to die if it mean making it harder for someone to kill Darling. There's a difference.</br></br>  <br>Ms.Smith is best girl</br>   you will never introduce a cute Lamia to your mother and watch her try to learn how to cook from your mom and cutely fail   Should I watch the stream with manga open in another window or should I wait for subs to come out?  <br>Oi! Oi! Hey Smith!</br>  <br>But does she put out for Darling?</br>  <br><br> I'm going to keep making you squeal, so prepare yourself! </br></br>  <br><br>Other than the full moon and Lala's introduction episodes (which also made Miia more assertive as well), I don't remember any of them trying as hard as she does to get into darling's pants</br></br>  What was Rachnee doing in Miia's room at the start of chapter 27? It showed her holding an item as explanation, but I couldn't identify said item.  <br> Monmusume Kancolle <br>What?</br></br>  <br><br>....What did she do wrong?</br></br>  <br>It's a marker. She wrote on her forehead.</br>  <br>She was drawing on her forehead</br>  <br>Last one.<br>Cancer's Letter Two<br><br> Honey, <br>  <br> Aren't you a bit too cold to me? <br> ...is what I first thought, but it can't be helped. <br> This part of you, awkwardly trying to <br>be nice to me like that, I don't hate it.<br> But I guess I am also a bit at fault here... you know. <br> As an apology... I'll tie you up plenty~ <br>  <br> Rachnee <br><br>Those are all the letters.

Rach is perfect waifu material.</br>  <br><br>All of them would be sad in a polygamous marriage  except maybe Suu and probably Papi. </br></br>  <br> &gt;being THIS delusional <br>Bwahahahahaha<br>Go on, strawman a little and say it's not the same, it's not going to make any difference.</br></br></br>  <br>No you Rokurokubi.</br>  <br> implying it's rape if you want to have sex with her <br> implying her lightly raping the other girls isn't a great show  <br>I don't see a problem with it.</br></br></br>  <br>Bonus.

It would essentially be the same set up they have now except with him banging them instead of having eternal blue balls. Miia and Cerea would probably be the most likely to be sad about it, though I could also see both of them being fine as long as they get their fair share. Suu would obviously be fine since it was her idea, Papi is dumb enough to not care, Mero would think its hot, Rachnee would probably just consider it her harem and continue tying up all the girls, and Lala would just keep up her 'waiting until he dies' plan.</br>  <br>Rachnee is simply great. It's a shame that she has the shittiest fanbase.</br>  <br>Lala already rules there.</br>  <br>She doesn't believe that someone could just like her. My heart.</br>  <br>Rachnee is cute, CUTE.</br>  <br>confirmed for  good  taste</br>  <br>Wasn't she who used him for like a hundred types of bondage thing?</br>  <br> and Lala would just keep up her 'waiting until he dies' plan. <br> Suddenly vampire/lich girl appears.  <br> Darling's immortal now <br> Lala's trying to kill him for good in every chapter </br></br></br></br>  <br> cute Rachnee <br> not posting the follow-up page. </br></br>  <br>She's an independant woman with a strong personality that likes to tease MC. Also  legs. </br>  <br> &gt; Beautiful  <br> &gt; Strong <br> &gt; Chill about relationships <br> &gt; Conveniently placed vagina and ass <br>The other girls have those two, with some variations (lacking one, but with another thing etc).<br>It's easy to pull "free points" like those for every girl.<br><br>I'll give you the others tho, hammocks and leglocking are great.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> picks THREE girls and still can't match the number of times Miia tries to fuck him in chapter 1 <br> still uses the word strawman incorrectly <br> laughs like a retard <br>Look, I won't hold it against you, but why do you even try if you have absolutely nothing worthy to say?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Chinese New Year, I guess. <br> All cousin's grown up. <br> Two nephews from cousins, two and six <br> Younger one relatively well-behaved <br> Older one may be cheekier <br> May try to grope horse tits while riding <br> Mother will be pleased I'm eating more veggies <br> Nice garden <br><br>Except for a fifty-carrots-a-day food bill, and finding a way to dispose of droppings(maybe sell to fertiliser company), few downsides. Well, except for the part where I live in an apartment.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that ones doesn't count because I say so </br>  <br> start reading the manga <br> guy living with a snakegirl <br> seems interesting <br> suddenly there are 4 different girls living with him <br> all lusts for his cock <br> my interesting daily life with monstergirl story is degraded into haremshit <br><br>It's not that I really mind, it just caught me off guard.<br>At least it's not the usual haremshit, because monsters, etc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was just saying some of the reasons I liked Rachnee, I wasn't comparing her to the others girls.</br>    <br>She's a pro, she never hurt him with bondage.</br>  <br>where were you when Darling won the Rachnebowl?</br>  <br>what stream?</br>  <br>Personally, I have a thing for sadists and scratching. Also, I really like the whole embraced with spiky legs bit.<br>But that's just me.</br></br>  So<br><br>Disregarding who you think is best girl<br><br>Who do you think Darling will actually pick?<br> I think it'll be a cop out and nobody will be picked </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wanna tease Rachnee.<br>I want Crab to make her blush more.</br></br>  <br>GATTAI</br>  <br> replying without knowing what you're replying to <br>Did I say the other girls never tried to fuck him?</br></br>  <br>Don't know, I'm a pleb that only knows 3, but neetball is offline and yucie is dead</br>  <br>I'm just saying when every character is beautiful, using that as a point is a little... ah whatever.<br>I agree with you.</br></br>  <br> __Lala__ </br>  <br>Miia, no contest. Assuming it isn't an harem end.</br>  <br>suu will absorb him and everyone else and they become one gestalt consciousness but then is killed when goku throws the spirit at them, so in short goku wins.</br>   Darling will never marry all or any of them   <br>Nobody wins. There is no satisfying conclusion except harem end.</br>  <br>Harem end  in life, Lala in death. </br>  <br>but I hate harms they are shit</br>  <br>And that makes it ok?</br>  <br> Did I say the other girls never tried to fuck him? <br><br> &gt;she's the only girl that wants Darling's D so bad, what a slut! <br> Pretty much, yeah. <br>Let me guess, you're going to go as far as to use the "so bad" to imply a difference.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the crunchy steam is saying 1 hour and 47 minutes<br>are they really that fast at subbing or would this be raw?</br></br>  <br>Who's pink hair?<br>Completely forgotten her</br></br>  <br>The thing about a harem end is that Miia loses in that case. Her entire bit is that she didnt want to share darling with the other lamias, I imagine having to share him with girls he actually loves would hurt Miia even more.</br>  <br>He will obviously chose all of them <br><br><br> Introduce Rachne to mom <br> Heart attack <br> Mom is honest and a little brutish but she can recognise nice people <br> They'll hit off nicely I think <br><br> Introduce Miia to mom <br> She is phobic of snakes <br> I'm fucked beyond the realm of fuckedness </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nobody important.</br>  <br> Let me guess, you're going to go as far as to use the "so bad" to imply a difference <br>I'm only working with what you said, anon. If you didn't mean what you actually said, then why did you write it that way?</br></br>  <br>They are actually quite fast when they want to.</br>    <br>Girl knows comfy.</br>  <br> are they really that fast at subbing or would this be raw? <br>Again, they get the scripts well ahead of time.</br></br>  <br> co-cast? <br><br>Nothing to see here.</br></br></br>  <br>It's Merio you pleb</br>  <br><br>Anybody saying anyone else other than Miia is delusional. It's all but confirmed at this point.</br></br>  <br>That's quite the behavior one would expect from a Yandere.</br>  <br>I'd say most likely would be harem end, next would be a no one/he died ending, after that Miia, after that the rest of the girls in no particular order.</br>  <br>Probably.</br>  <br>Here</br>  <br>how  tragic </br>  <br> signs with Miia <br><br> Miia confirmed for victor <br><br> Cerea will be destroyed by monstrous centaur douchebags for the rest of her life </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok? It's even better, it shows she's the only one aware of how she treats Darling.<br><br>I'll take her gentle femdom over the harem slaughter any day.</br></br></br>  <br> Again, they get the scripts well ahead of time. <br>if thats the case why dont they just make it a literal simulcast?</br></br>  <br>Zombina is kinda an asshole</br>  <br>Yeah i forgot about worst girl for a bit there</br>  <br>Assuming it will pick one, either Miia because first girl or Cerea because author's favourite (iirc).<br>Harem end is possible but doubt crabman will pull that. Could see it though going in the middle ground and take poligamy with Miia/Papi/Cerea, which are the only girls Smith proposed him to pick for marriage at this point.<br><br>But either way it ends i'm willing to bet the rest of the cast will keep hanging around Darling somehow.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you! Will try to translate it shortly.</br>  <br> meizhi </br>  <br>thats the one I used last time, <br>didn't seem like anyone else knew about it , perhaps thats for the best</br></br>  <br> using a meaningless expression I obviously used without thinking to cover for your argument <br>I don't study every single word I write, where not in a court after all.<br>Miia has had more chances but I hope you're not deluded enough to deny the others want Darling (and whatever he hides in his legendary crotch) as bad as her.</br></br></br>  <br>Crab is in too deep. He has to go full harem or suffer alienating everybody who doesn't agree with his final choice.<br><br>He could always make every other girl progessively shittier until only one is the obvious choice and nobody could deny, but that would also ruin the fanbase anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>She wouldn't be that happy about it but I'm sure she'd prefer a harem ending to him flat out picking a different girl.</br>  <br> Harem end is possible but doubt crabman will pull that </br>  Will the spunk monk oba-san on the right return? What about female darling in the middle?  <br>She also seems like the only one in the Harem that's not a virgin.</br>  <br>Them big fat horse titties.</br>  <br> Master <br> It makes Papi very happy that Master is always playing with her. <br> Let's splash around in the water again sometime, okay? <br> Papi </br></br></br></br>  <br>The app safe?</br>  <br>Wait what game</br>  <br>wait!<br>what if<br>they make clones of kurusu?</br></br></br>  <br>wheres a live stream?</br>  Papi and Mero are mai waifus.  <br>femdarling a qt</br>  So, where are Darling's parents, they are abroad for their job, but will they come back one day ? And if yes, what will be their reaction to the harem ?  <br>Definitely agree with this. The amount of pure butthurt that will happen if it isn't a harem end would be intense. Harem ending is the obvious choice but then again that might just persuade him to do something different for the sake of being unexpected.</br>  <br>Wait where are these from?</br>  <br>A proud father.</br>  What would Cera do if she saw darling's  penis?   <br>That's gonna make for a fun Chapter.</br>  <br> final episode <br> OP updated with Lala </br></br>  <br>Thanks, saved me the trouble.

Disgusting.</br>  <br>You picked well.</br>  Amazon.com and JP suddenly stopped charging a deposit fee if you live in Mexico does this has anything to do with the fact that they opened an Amazon.com.mx some weeks ago? <br><br> inb4 google <br><br>Haven't found anything, and I know there's some anons here from Mexico.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Having seen and held one, it's a fair bit bigger than regular figmas.

Consider getting better taste anon.</br>  I don't want to read this abortion of a thread that was ruined from post 1. <br><br>Somebody tell me when it comes out.</br></br>  <br> B-Be safe anon </br>  <br> autism </br>  <br><br>T-Thanks anon<br><br>I feel better now after venting thanks buyfag friends.</br></br></br></br>  Is anybody else planning to scalp her when she comes in?  <br><br>Not only that, but licenses for game characters are not as cheap as anime ones.</br></br>  I've got a sale lined up where the fag wants to pay $250 for her. But I'm not sure I want to sell it. I mean look at those thighs. Where her legs always that meaty?   hating on pochaco   Those fucking quads. Has she been working out?  Can we please have two buyfag threads from now on? One of them can be for the landwhales to shitpost in, and the other can be the normal buyfag thread where we talk about figures that do not canonically have diabetes.  <br>The spores on her legs ruin it for me.</br>    <br>Get rekt faggot</br>  <br> tfw no chinbotsu fig </br>  <br>Why don't you go to Reddit so you can downvote everything you don't like?</br>  <br>All K-ON characters have meaty thighs.

Alright, so this one is for the anon who wanted a picture of my newly installed Ikea 6 dollar spice racks. I just threw some shit on it to give you an idea of how big they are and how they look with an average scale figure. <br>They are a good size, really cheap and don't require any brackets, which can get pricey. Just two screws in the wall and you're good to go. <br>The safety bar is pretty nice in theory, especially if you live in an earthquake zone and are paranoid about that stuff, but it does obscure too much of smaller figures to make it a display option for them. <br> But good thing is that you don't have to install the rack with the safety bar, it is optional.

I was gonna put her with Harvest Miku and Raiden.  <br>Rotate the rack 180 degrees and remove the bar.

To my understanding, it's just "July."

They already have reddit and mfc, why can't they just leave this place alone ;_;  <br>No, not "exactly." There are frequently people who post here with information about the exact days of release of figures, so it's not unreasonable to query the community here for information not available elsewhere. Stop being a faggot. If you don't know the answer, then ignore the post and let other people answer.</br>  <br>ignore and don't reply to them.</br>  <br>Precisely.</br>  PVC never.  <br>I like it.</br>  <br><br>You know they're not good yet you're still trying to convince yourself they were worth it.

Hip and waist are literally synonyms.</br></br>  <br>I agree. I think they look fine with plants and other average household curios, but plastic figures don't look quite right. Maybe if the shelves were painted, since the bare wood and the figures clash as is.<br><br>But of course it would have been better to have bought proper shelves in the first place.</br></br></br>  <br>You know, they were six bucks. If I didn't like them I would just toss them, not live with buyers remorse after stapling them to my walls.

I only have one Jap BD, and that's Only Yesterday.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Ah, but I didn't even post my film collection. That's all anime.</br>  <br>Pretty sure thats due to licensing. Metal Gear figs are usually done by Play Arts and those are normally expensive to begin with</br>  g-guys, what did I buy and how do I put on the stickers? It's a 'board' game right?    <br><br>No one in these threads condones buying localized.</br></br>  <br>Speak for yourself anon.</br>  <br>Well I do think I see a double chin</br>  <br>Man, I'd be annoyed by the fact I won't be able to pose them.</br>  <br>That's a little silly when it comes to DVD/BD releases though. Even if I knew moon, Japanese releases are horribly expensive. I've heard even Japanese people sometimes import localized releases. If it helps there are quite a few imported releases there,  from the UK .</br>  <br>That's just the echo chamber effect confusing you. It's always just two or three people bitching and starting an argument over it. Most people lurking don't give a shit.</br>  Hey mates, have some cash laying around and thought I may as well buy some figures, read through the guide, what would you say would be the best figures for Shinji, Rei and Asuka?  <br><br>People buy original japanese releases because they come with better extras, and it's a better way of supporting the creators. elevens don't buy localized that much because everything is so readily available online nowadays. Some localizations have english hardsubs to piss off reverse importers, so there's even less of a reason to do it.</br></br>  <br><br>Everytime</br></br>  <br>I buy those Blu-Rays, the packaging is beautiful, but just not worth the $70.</br>    <br>But what if I don't have a cat?</br>  <br> come with better extras <br>But at what price?<br> better way of supporting the creators <br>Can't say I care. <br><br><br>Yeah, I only did it because Only Yesterday is my favorite Ghibli film and I wasn't content with just having the UK DVD release. I doubt I'd do that for very many other movies, maybe Gauche the Cellist and Jarinko Chie (if it had subs).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Gotta show that girls can like boy stuff too!</br>  <br>A dog is fine too</br>  <br>Most people in Japan don't buy anime bluray. They just watch it on TV.<br><br>The average wage in Japan is not higher than the UK or US. Rental and second hand trading is still huge in Japan for a reason. Only a few otaku actually buy anime.<br><br>I have watched about 50 shows now. If I had to buy them all on DVD/bluray I would be homeless by now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It shouldn't be very difficult to find a stray. Just lure it in with a piece of meat.</br>  <br>Pose what?</br>    <br>Preferably not lewd, just want cool figures preferably in plugsuits. Thank you though!</br>  <br>But what if they're covered in fleas? Last thing I need in my life is another bout with scabies.</br>  <br> Can't say I care. <br><br>Why do you buy them then? It'd be cheaper to buy an external hard drive.</br></br></br>  <br>Ftfy</br>  <br>I like collecting DVD/BDs. I have film collection that's about the same size. I still torrent plenty of anime.</br>  <br>Then you aren't ideal.</br>  <br> But at what price? <br><br>A premium. That's what you get. <br><br> Can't say I care. <br><br>Then fuck off. Show off your Manga Video bullshit collection on </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just checked it: Last exile BD is 800$ on amazon.</br>  <br>That's not lewd.</br>  <br> lewd <br>Sorry, I'm not sure if they have eva figures in hijab.</br></br>  <br>dude...it ain't rocket surgery...seriously?</br>    <br>the fuck is a rana</br>  <br><br>that's not lewd, its just a well sculpted butt in a plugsuit</br></br>  <br> Not all buyfags! </br>  <br><br>Holy shit, it's true.

I beat the shit out of him until he was spitting blood.</br>  Just checked because I was thinking it myself during the first episode and because of the confusion in this thread<br><br>DO NOT READ THE SPOILER IN THIS POST IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW IF THE PLOT POINT IS TRUE OR NOT.<br><br> Ctrl F'ing through a translation of the first volume has her betraying everyone at the end and it doesn't appear to be any sort of ruse or anything. Not checking the other volumes outside of the beginning of the second (scanned through it to confirm it didn't open with her revealing she was just rusing them) so if that changes at any point in 2-4 or whatever else is released, I don't know for sure. <br><br> Look around for a translation and check Chapter 5 (or the very end of it, no clue if it's just this translation that is dividing it into chapters) of the first volume if you don't believe me. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He receives the mark 6 months after the tournament.</br>  <br>Don´t cut yourself now.</br>    bunny girl is a slut that betrays everyone <br>I'm mad and at the same it's expected.<br>Does at least the strongest humans libido purify her?</br></br>  i knew it.........  <br>I agree with him, and I don't fault translators. There's only been one LN that I've been able to stomach, and that was only because of what it was about.

I can spoil everything?  <br> Be you <br> start my blogposts with 'be me' in case it wasn't clear who was writing the post <br> deserve to get spoiled </br></br></br>   Huur durr the heroine isn't like my other seasonal waifus and doesn't suck the MC's dick <br> She's a shit, A SHIT! <br><br> The Majin doesn't die, he needs to be sealed within a month every century which is not an effective solution. They need a permanent one, like finding a way to kill him for good or just go with her plan (not the let's unite the world, that's just delusional) which is coexistence between kyouma and humans.<br><br>Sometimes you need to see the situation from another point of view. She's trying to save the world with another method than the one the heroes always used.<br/></br></br> </br></br></br>  I thought  Goldof  was the traitor. I\ll just keep reading until I hit a wall.  Later on you find that there's another seventh once the rabbitgirl is revealed to be the first seventh.<br><br>Adlet is actually the other seventh, but he's not evil. He just got brainwashed into being a whitefag for fremmy. Also fremmy is a ticking time bomb, if she's killed, then everybody around her is kill or something.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br> if she's killed, then everybody around her is kill or something. <br>That's what Adlet wants you to believe.</br></br>    <br>It's actually rokka.<br><br>Yes, they replace the word 'rokka' with 'brave'</br></br></br>  <br>Of course, this is not animesuki.</br>  <br>Is this legit? I really want to believe you.</br>  <br> ticking time bomb <br><br>Huh, it kind of does seem appropriate that if the saint of gunpowder were to die, she'd explode violently.<br><br>Though if that were true, then it gives me the feeling the series will end tragically with Fremmy sacrificing herself to blow up the majin after all seems lost.<br><br>And the only survivor will be Chamo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> coexistence between kyouma and humans <br><br>Gotta tell the Majin to stop invading the human world.</br></br></br>  <br>There's something off about her face.</br>  <br>She's not the heroine</br>  <br>Look back at vol1, his obsession to Fremy came out of nowhere and his first priority even when everyone was coming to kill him was still Fremy, he has one job.<br><br><br>It's not literal bomb, she'll absorb all the other crests that means annihilation in the middle of demon land. Honestly Fremy will be more happy if she died in vol5, I can't wait to see her face when she regrets it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Bunny literally sucks dog penises <br> &gt;Fremy gets raped by demons <br> All the girls in this series are sluts <br>Picked up</br></br></br></br>  <br> animesukifag <br>Fuck off</br></br>  <br>It was not really like an obsession, it all made sense because the heroes needed to be together, his last action against Mora was to protect one of the heroes before dying, he did something similar to gain Hans's trust.</br>  <br> Implying Adlet won't give her a happy ending. </br>  <br>So is this a Tales of adaptation?</br>  <br>She wants to use the demon's power to overthrow humanity because muh family is dead</br>   2 sets of ears <br>That's how you detect a fake.</br>  <br> “In the case that you are genuine then the first thing you should do is find proof that I am the seventh. However you aren’t. That alone is enough reason to suspect you.” <br><br> Adlet thought it was a strange theory, but he understood that from her standpoint it wasn’t illogical. <br><br> “That, uh…” Adlet searched for an answer. Various words came up in his mind, but none of them seemed suitable. He couldn’t aptly put his feelings into the right words. <br><br> He then recalled when he’d first encountered Fremy. It seemed like an extremely long time ago, but in reality it was just that morning. The feelings he’d felt then were the ones he desperately expressed in words now. <br><br> “I don’t want to think you are the enemy.” <br><br>He has been defending her ever since they met.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> Durr LN's are shit hurr because they don't follow Western style writing. <br><br>Go fuck off to /lit/ if you don't like waifu and chuuni novels.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  “I wonder what Goldof-san is thinking about right now,” Dozzu said with a quiet voice. It was so soft that Nashetania was the only person who could hear him. <br><br>  “That’s right. He’s certainly troubled over whether to join our side or carry out the wishes of the Flowers. And more than anything he wants to see me again. That’s probably what he’s thinking.” <br><br>  "Is that so?” <br><br>  “It’s Goldof. There’s no reason I wouldn’t know that, right?” Nashetania said and then she smiled. <br><br>  “You were truly raised as a cruel girl. Do you even feel sorry about using Goldof-san?” <br><br>  "What are you saying? Goldof is definitely satisfied to be used by me.” <br><br>Bitch is the worst.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, but his actions were logical, only his impulse was not. No need to consider everything as if it was because of Tgurneu.</br>  <br> only his impulse was not <br>Guess why</br></br>  <br>Didn't she conspire with Dozzu to kill her dad because he wouldn't play along with their plot. Or something along those lines.</br>  <br>bunny ears are part of her helmet.</br>  <br>I know why his impulse was not logical, but the rest was. His reveal was something logical, it was to protect another hero, and he did so for other heroes other than Fremy, protect your allies is natural.</br>  <br>She blames her dad for fucking things up</br>  <br>I can already tell that would just go swimmingly.</br>  <br> unironically using frontpage  <br> complains when he sees spoilers  <br>Xd xd xd kill yourself</br></br></br>  <br> Overthrow humanity <br>No that's not what she wants<br><br>And that's why you should not believe everything here, go back to animesuki.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Western style writing. <br><br>That's not the problem, you fucking moron. I read LN's myself, but don't pretend that they aren't shit. They are written in a incredibly simple manner, as they are made for teens.<br><br>They are literally a babys first novel in writing quality</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So you read shit for teens?</br>  <br>Because that's the only thing Tgurneu did to him, the rest was all himself.</br>  <br>No, a babby's first would be goddamn comics and manga. Even if it has pretty pictures, it still counts as literature despite its low rung in the ladder. LN's are above that because it ain't all visual and you still have to use your imagination to imagine the details.</br>  <br>/lit/ likes quite a lot of japanese books, none of them LNs, and none of them books with "western style" writing.</br>  <br>That's what I wanted to say all along when I answered to , his actions were not unnatural, only his impulse was, he has always been himself.</br>  <br>Mora has a kid and a husband.</br>  <br>LN's are good for entertainment, and there are a few exceptions that are incredibly good</br>  <br>The husband is in the way. Time for some NTR.</br>  <br> not using the frontpage <br><br>Fuck you and your newfangled bullshit</br></br></br>  <br>Good job proving half of his point.</br>  The guy behind Book of Bantorra wrote this.  Wait, wait so is this like FFIII where there are seven warriors of light and seven warriors of darkness and the bunny girl leads the warrior of darkness?  <br>FUK YOU OP SPOILING SHIT HOPE YOUR SISTER GETS HIT BY A TRUCK.</br>  <br>Any LN is written better than say... 50 Shades of Grey.</br>  <br>Almost anything is written better then porn for middle aged woman</br>  <br>I didn't know that. So anyone and everyone gonna die?</br>  <br>I learned something interesting today. I don't know how the LN are but the show had some good parts and a very interesting setting  and an absolutely awful end.  Also Bantorra wasn't shy about sexuality and other deviant stuff.</br>  <br>It didn't happen in Bantorra so why would it happen here?<br><br> HAMYUTS MESETA WO KOROSE </br></br></br>  <br>I thought a lot of characters died? Or is that just my shit memory being shit. I remember Noloty at least ;;</br>  I don't care what happens she's cute as fuck and I need more of her  What are the chances of her redemption? because I had her as best girl but best girl can't be a traitor  <br>oldfags are not people so it is no surprise.</br>  <br>It only gets worse and worse for Nashetania as time goes on.<br><br>Repent your sins now, and convert to Fremy, she who suffers to atone for all of us.</br></br></br>  <br>good lord that's sad. i think i'll make Adlet best girl and leave it at that</br>  <br>A lot. Not all.</br>  <br>Delete this</br>  Spoiler tags exist, so use them dipshits  <br>だが断る</br>  <br>  it only gets worse. <br>This is almost as bad as NTR</br></br>  I am nearing at the end of volume 1 and all I can say is, bunnyslut's plan is quite good but then again it failed so it's shit. <br><br> Can I still like bunnyslut? </br></br>  <br>You're a fucktard.</br>  Does this mean this series will turn out as shitty as Brave 10?  <br> Can I still like bunnyslut? <br>As long as it's for a traitorous nature and generous body.</br></br>  We Went to Look at the Stars<br><br>Was pretty underwhelmed by first episode, but the ruler game was somehow exciting, and the origin of Hotarun's crush was very sweet.

It's your body! No one has the right to touch you if you don't want them to! So what do you do? First, you say no, then you get outta there! Most important, you gotta tell someone you trust, like your parents, your teacher or a police officer. </br>  I remember watching the first Non Non Biyori because I saw images of dressed up Hotaru with glasses around and I thought she was like, an anime college girl that hit all my kinks.<br><br>Oh boy, when I watched the series... I don't know man, I just don't know.</br></br>  <br>Definitely tell the teacher!<br><br>Parents might judge you for being unclean, cops won't believe you. Only the teacher to turn to.

S1 was my AOTY back then. Why am i not enjoying this as much?</br></br>  <br>I really liked both episodes in this season. I feel like Komari's character is finally falling into place. In S1 she was often used for more standard jokes than the rest of the cast. Same thing with Hotaru's obsession with her. In S1 it was jarringly otaku-ish in an otherwise very grounded series, but this episode was sweet.</br>  <br>Well I was expecting a continuation. Renge's loli-buddy showing up, the girls going on a trip to Tokyo (though that would be great as a longer ova), stuff from S1 forming traditions for the next year.<br><br>It's not bad, but it's a bit disappointing knowing the basic idea of what happens over an entire season from ep 1.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I was expecting (and hoping) for a continuation too, though honestly I don't mind so far. Both episodes of Repeat so far have been fun and adorable</br>  Does me being mad over the fact that they used a fucking human to voice the dog in e2 instead of taking actual dog sounds make me retarded?<br><br>It's an anime about life in a rural area, with the sound of cicadas, other bugs, birds, cows etc. in the background, which makes it very immersive and then they let a human voice the dog?<br><br>I'm sorry this triggered me so much /a/. Maybe i'm truly autistic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Same here, it knocked me out of the moe zone but I laughed at it nonetheless</br>  <br>Are all dogs actually cursed lolicons?</br>  <br> Non Non Biyori Repeat <br> it's literally S1 repeated <br>Can someone tell me what the actual fuck is going on?</br></br></br>  <br><br>The apologists will be along shortly.</br></br>  Vivid subs when?  <br> literally <br> so far all material was not in S1 <br><br>alrighty then</br></br></br></br>  <br>You call that a curse? I wish I could get away with licking little girls' faces and dry humping their leg.</br>  <br>It was shit compared to the Katou Emiri dog in Gakkou Gurashi.</br>  <br>What cartoon is this semen demon from? Google only gives me "anime cry gif" results.</br>  <br>She's from tumblr and should never have been used here.</br>  <br>Can Nii-chan beat servants at the ruler game</br>  I had forgotten how adorable everyone is.<br>And damn, the complete darkness in that scene made me miss a few things from the past. Sadly I didn't have a tiny Komari back then.</br>  <br> jpg </br>  <br><br>Sword Art Online.

It looks fun.  <br>Just make some friends anon!  ;~; </br>  <br>It wouldn't be that weird if I went to the store just to buy 4 different rulers for myself? r-right?</br>  <br>It's like Hidamari Sketch. You get new material that wasn't in the previous season.</br>  <br>Except there are things that have not been resolved.<br>One of them being one of the main reasons I fucking picked up the second season.</br></br>  <br>You shouldn't worry too much about it, maybe the sequel eps will be at the end or an OVA</br>  <br>I don't got another 2 years to wait for this shit.<br>This was the entire reason I was waiting 2 years for THIS season. <br>Fuck everything.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I feel your pain.</br></br>  <br>in the two years since then selfies became a thing and non non biyori can never show that photograph ever again</br>  <br>Having a season taking place a year later means that they will have to develop new character models and make them look older, and we know animes don't age.</br>  Candy Store when?  <br> things that have not been resolved. <br>Like what?</br></br>  <br>Now.</br>  <br> Anon finally gathers enough courage to go to the store and buy 4 different rulers (but not pink girly ones because that would be just too much) <br> Anon waits until everyone else in the household is either asleep or out working/living their lives <br> Anon cleans his table with great enthusiasm and sets up the rulers, smiling like a maniac, already looking forward to having a great time <br> Anon starts to play, shouting the names of the special attacks louder and louder every time <br> Anon's knees finally give in and he breaks down crying, collapsing onto the floor because he knows he'll never be 1/10th as happy as the Biyoris ever. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> selfies is a new thing <br><br>Underage detected.</br></br></br>  <br>Not him but it's almost like you don't even know what a joke is.</br>  <br> damage control </br>  <br>Nah, just come in and say, I need to measure a certain part of myself, I'm too embarrassed to tell you where. <br>Come in next day: yo that ruler wasn't big enough, got any bigger?<br>Repeat 2 more times. <br><br>End result: You on the left.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, literally not him, you're just stupid.</br>  <br>Ok, sameanon.</br>  <br> people backpedal this hard </br>  <br>It's not backpedaling if you're sticking to the same point.</br>  <br>Sure thing buddy maybe one day you will understand what a joke is and not make an ass of yourself.<br>I like that the guy who made the joke hasn't said jack shit. No, it's a bit annoying actually.</br></br>  <br> End result: My dreams come true <br>Is this really how it works?</br></br>  <br>Probably because he didn't say it as a joke and is too embarrassed to speak up or you're just pretending to be somebody else.</br>    <br>Well I did meet a 12 year old on here a few hours ago so you never know. </br>  <br>Or maybe it's because I said it as a joke I didn't want to argue just to receive "hurr damage control" in reply.</br>  I don't think we can go more lesbian than this scene  <br>The only thing more lesbian than that is 2 girls getting unashamedly married.</br>  <br>Liar!</br>  What happened to the vacation thing? You know, the OVA? Are they saving it for the final episodes?  <br>It's a shame such a body will be wasted on lesbian sex</br>  <br>It's been out.<br>I think I've watched it or I'm going crazy.</br></br>  <br>You know I can't prove it. Which is why I didn't want an argument. But I couldn't allow an innocent Anon to get insulted.<br><br>Of course, there's no way I can prove that it's two separate people and not a very elaborate ruse on my part. For all they know even you, the person I am replying to, is me. <br><br>Anyway, good night.

I'm new here (only to jojo threads after finishing part 8)  <br> your hair will never be a smug salamander </br>  <br>I thought that part I had some slight homo-eroticism with Dio and Jonathan, and there's something about Joseph that just screams gay. Not to mention that in Japanese culture, the more masculine, built men are typically seen as gay.</br>  <br>Every single coloring I've seen is shit, is there not an official one or is it also shit?</br>  <br>There is an official one and it is also quite bad</br>  <br>Maybe it's because I'm not a fujoshi. The first three parts aren't even the gayest, you should read on.</br>  <br>The most homoerotic part is clearly part 5, which was intentional on Araki's part due to it being prevalent within the fashion industry. I wouldn't say there are any muscle men in it though, especially when pic related is the most heterosexual character.</br>    Manga or anime for the first 3 parts?  <br>Might as well just watch the anime, honestly.</br>  <br>Why do you say? Is there virtually no difference? Anime quality on par with manga?</br>  <br>It's extremely faithful and doesn't cut anything of significance.  Plus Part 1 and 2's art is horrible. </br>  <br>It's a scene to scene thing for me. For example, I liked both of the darbys more in the anime but liked dio's world more in the manga.</br>  <br>Anime</br>  <br>Part 2's art is good for most of it.

But these dont count because I say so" <br> disregards the rest of the list because of just that </br></br></br>  So, do they ever fuck or will this be like Kimi ni Todoke where the main couple dances around their feelings and won't even share one fucking kiss before the anime is over?
