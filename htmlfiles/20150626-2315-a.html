[ Would you an elf /a/?  I would    All day, every day.   No, elves are lewd beasts and exist only for extermination  Reminder that Danmachi is pandering garbage for tasteless idiots.   Weird-looking proportions.   I'm gonna miss this show.  Elves are shit  Why is she so sexy, is there any more pics of her clad in her armor like this?   if only your mom swallowed      No. I'd rather make demi-gods with the best goddess.

I brought it up to discuss just how shitty J.C. Staff's animation team is.    so we agree ais is shit?    If you're an animeonlyfag then maybe, and only because J.C. Staff a shit. Otherwise Ais a best.    Ais is best girl faggot.    I would accept her surrender.    Are you a faggot son?    you do know that  she is his half sister     Stop with these fake spoilers.    vol 9 LN bitch   would you let her instruct you?    You do realize that even if that wasn't fake, that would only make her even more best girl right     Last volume is volume 8.    not here in japan it isnt    Post some darkies     She looks hot.       Volume 9 will be out in September.    its October where im from    I would an elf, but I would a brown dfc even more    Good taste.    idk which jp you live in but 8 is the latest I know.    So it's like all anime, then?    wow    Posting a shitty character doesn't help you know.    definitely!   Needs more Lili   here you go, this is waht you want right faggot?     Linking worst girl.      Almost July of 2015.   Still no exhentai access.       Still no exhentai access  What?    is eps 13 going to be an extra long eps? will we get a few ova?

The ration is insane, including fan art, there's like 1 to every 15 Hestias    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127143210  but...that's best elf.    What's the point anyway? They can't even enter a dungeon, and even when they do they can't use their powers. It would be hard to make having a God MC enjoyable in this series. However, I'd love for a spin off of an up and coming God building a familia/Harem and just hanging out with other gods and getting into SoL shenanigans while his cute familia risks their lives to support his dumb ass.       http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/event<wbr>s/boob-ribbon  Within the first 3 weeks, Hestia fanart on the Japanese image sharing website Pixiv increased to more than 1,000.[1] According to Pixiv’s daily view tracker (shown below), the views peaked on April 9th, 2015, with 722,886 views. In that same period, on the online image boards Danbooru[2] and Gelbooru,[3] Hestia’s tag had surpassed 1,300 images, making up the largest quantity of the fanart for the show which contained 1,400 images  what do you expect?    </wbr>     linking that website  This will not turn out well for you.     I'd expect better from Japan. So many great girls and they chose only the generic DereDere cockblocker.     ヘスティア ダン   6171 results  She finally broke 6k.     Nips like generic shit. I mean, they could choise Good Girl Ais, Best Elf, or any of the two maids.

She isn't even full elf   Are there any brown goddess in this series?  I require a full list of all elves in anime.    An elf   Wearing blomers  Is that the ultimate rape magnet?      I would an elf. Totally.  Ryu is totally on another level though. Would want to grow old with.   Even though I'll be the only one looking older          You don't even know their names, fighting style, or race, do you?     I would rather some Asufi.   The hair doesn't really fit    It's an invaluable resource for finding the origins of memes. I don't know what else you would use it for though.     dw bout the bloomers, that ZR!    Why are you so mad? Did the LN writer and JC Staff gangrape your puppy?     What's worse is that "five seconds with the Paint Bucket tool" look      But the fanservice is nice.     Did the LN writer and JC Staff gangrape your puppy?   JC Staff has consistently produce shitty anime for the last 20 years, and this season is no exception.      Not garbage, but worse than this    Just like all other studios. Your point?    brown is best taste    Don't get me wrong. Hephaestus is fine too, but Hesita just has more to offer. She is the goddess of fertility you know.    Anyone got a clean stitch of that?     Hephaestus is fine too   No she isn't.  I believe I speak for everyone here when I say Hephaestus is too old be attractive.          Wonderful. Thanks.       This isn't brown. Just adding a bit of tint doesn't make you brown retards.      Every fucking thread   Isn't today the new episode?   Now draw a slit for her pussy    No. That's tomorrow.     FUCK I GOT EXCITED FOR NOTHING MY DAY IS RUINED     That would only make things hotter.    Could somebody please make a decent edit from this pic?    best ass    That that's just shit taste     being brown doesn't make you brown   lol       Not him but brown people are considered white in the U.S by the government or at least that's what I heard.     Now I feel like eating vanilla ice cream for some reason.   I really like Hestia's body of work     I'd like to hammer her anvil everyday.    Thanks.    True. Her body of work has the best presentation.       So in the latest episode we knew that lily is chienthrope?    This show has a Gaia-tier following.  Back in the day these threads would be imagespammed, sagebombed, and most people would just tell you all to fuck off.   However, the board is so dumbed down now that your circlejerk faggotry just has to be endured..        I really don't like using the word edgy, but seriously.      gaia tier following  Wat ??     The butthurt here is palpable.    If a show is airing then people will talk about it, regardless of how good it is. Since it's popular people will post about it so containment threads are necessary.    You should go complain in the JoJo threads too. They're worst bunch on /a/.     containment threads  that word, etc     I'd watch/read pretty much anything as long as our lord and saviour Yasuda is working on it.   Danmachi isn't even that bad, compared to the average anime out there.        I'm aware.     This. Danmachi isn't GREAT but it's by far one of the best shows i've watched from this season.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dcf<wbr>7dQg0JVA</wbr>  [ ]   How do I open this?

Shit's ending tomorrow so when are we going to see him pick up girls in a dungeon?   Best girl.    You still haven't realized the tittle was a joke and that the roles got reversed instead? Bell is Aiz's princess.     Bell isn't a women. Men can't be princesses.     But King of Ooo is now princess of the candy kingdom.    I want more fan art of her.    Put Bell in a dress and he could easily pass for a princess.    Go google it you lazy fuck    Japan has shit taste, what can you do   <br/>  <br/>    Femdomfags please go and stay go.       And Aiz is not a man. The point is that the role and the gender archetype for these kind of stories were reversed.     objectively    Is there any other character from any other anime that has become that popular among artists in so short time as Hestia did or does it just seem to me that Hestia is especially popular and there are character like that every season? Also pic somewhat related. Goro fucking a ugly Hestia cosplayer when?    Chaika    Perfect answer.     I was too busy to actively browsing pixiv and other pages when Chaika aired so i didn't know that well. But was it also as fast, so that it had the number of fan art before it ended airing that most popular characters don't reach for a good couple of months after it finished?      Yes, but not really original stuff    how was Witchcraft Works femdom? She was nurturing and maternal which aren't exactly femdom traits.    second best girl    go into Orc dungeon on a quest given by Ganesh   kill all orcs   picking up fat loots, notice secret cave    go into cave expecting more loot   oshit, it's a bunch of chained up elves   their faces in despair.

Don't think too hard because they'll run up to your face and tell you, along with their shitty chili farts and fat asses trailing behind.      Texasbro     Holy fuck anon. Next time I need to shave my balls I'll call you.    i ant your bro    What?     Next time I need to shave my balls I'll call you.  what the fuck does that mean? if you want to touch dicks just say so.     I meant that you're such an edgy kid that you could shave balls like a pro.  An inherited skill from your mother perhaps.      you are edgy    But there are so many things that you can shave. And so many other things that requires edge to get the job done. Why balls, anon? Why balls? That's fucking gay.    Because that's the part you work best on.    Why shave and not use clippers? A razor could nick your balls and bleed everywhere.    But being edgy is actually really bad for shaving balls. You don't want someone edgy to shave balls, you want someone who is precise, neat and values hygiene. Being edgy increases the risk of damaging your balls instead. Do you really want that?     tfw you will never go dungeon diving with this qt.   tfw she won't calmly berate you for falling behind.   tfw she won't ever show her dere side to you after you almost die.   &gt;tfw you will never have "we might die tomorrow" sex every night.    &gt;tfw she will never berate you for falling behind while she tries to remain composed with your sword inside her scabbard to the hilt, while she moans quietly.

Going to need as many images to shitpost with for tomorrow and probably the next 10 days after.     Just shut the fuck up and post more Hestia tits.    don't tell me what to do nigger   I want to pound Bell-kun's qt boipussy while Hestia and Aiz watch.   Only Hestia would care. Aiz would sit in the corner like a soulless retard sniffing and enjoying the stink of her own armpits.    Why didn't they cast Norio Wakamoto as  Zeus ?     I want to taste her foot.     You seem to have something with the fact that Aiz is better than that slut goddess of cocks. Well, if it makes you feel better, you can think that way all what you want, but please don't share your shit taste with us.    Cold as  Aiz .     thinking Aiz the autist is best   Nigger, you have Aizberger's     I prefer autism over midget who screams at you for even looking at another girl or spend half your earnings on perfume while having 40 billion credit card debt.    That debt is for Hestia alone. The fact that she's willing to endure 1000 years of indentured servitude just for Bell is proof that she is best girl. Not only that, but she is canon virgin while Aiz get's molested by her tranny goddess every week.   I know were both just shitposting at this point but I'm enjoying it      Bell spends most of his earnings in the bar    many qt girls in this show   MC is the most fuckable of them all  why.jpeg     it's not gay if it's in a 3-way     Bell gets captured by mad adventures   held down and raped   mind breaks    Hestia goes looking for him   finds him shaking his ass to men in an ally   Brought to you by cannabis          It's not gay in a 3 way    Lili would still find a way to backstab Bell even after Welf had mounted him.     endure 1000 years of indentured servitude  That's like less than 1000000000000000th of a second relative to mortal lives.   I will miss the shitposting when the anime is over and nobody will talk about this series anymore. Just like Tokyo Ravens.

Off by couple years, bruh    sperm wyrm    Anal sex is better    I know Ais doesn't poop, but I'm sure Hestia does.     a goddess   needing to poop  Aiz, however, does poop in the canon      Goddess on mortal realm with all her power sealed. Ais doesn't need to poop because there's no bathroom in the dungeon. You can't go on two weeks without pooping in the dungeon (the length of her expedition for Floor 59), so it's proven she doesn't need to poop.    They probably have slimes they keep in captivity from the first floor that they shit in.     he doesn't know Aiz drops turds in the dungeon so they can find their way back out  level 1 pleb      there's no bathroom in the dungeon  the whole dungeon is one giant bathroom.     Basically everyone has smelled Ais' shit already then, what a slut.    Just like her ancestor.    Freedom descending to Earth and kicks everyone ass. Best gundam moment ever.    What?  Based.      You can't go on two weeks without pooping in the dungeon (the length of her expedition for Floor 59), so it's proven she doesn't need to poop.  Where the hell did you get this from? Anything that goes in must come out, Aiz eats therefore she must also poop. She can probably poop on demand though, like she can sleep. Like you're inside the dungeon for too long and suddenly aiz turns to you, looks you dead in the eye and says "I have to take a really mean shit, right now. Those potato croquettes are doing a number on my stomach." You can't say no, man, when you gotta go you gotta go. And you have to stick close to her while she either shits on the ground or in the bag where she kept the rations, dungeons aren't fun and games, mate, one wrong move and your bitch ass is dead, you need to piss and shit on the go, in front of everyone in your party if need be.         This is not a Hestia thread you dumbass.   Or at least it wasn't until the hestiafags invaded us       Always     e x p a n d      That makes no sense, people go in dungeon everyday. The early levels barely have any plants, how the fuck do they recycle?  Does the dungeon actually eat up all their shit and give birth to the monsters? That's so fucked up.       If you go into the dungeon for a day you won't need to shit, dumbass. Now if you spend days at a time in there, which means your probably exploring pretty deep then you'll need to shit.     It all depends on personal preferences. I want vaggo and womb. Others prefer anal.     invaded  We're in EVERY Danmachi thread. So it's always a Hestia thread.         We're in EVERY Danmachi thread. So it's always a Hestia thread.     Why the hell would one prefer anal anyway? Tightness? How it might feel depraved?  It takes too much work to actually do it decently. The girl needs a fully relaxed anus and you need a lot of lube since the anus can't self lubricate, not to mention an enema or two to be absolutely sure theres nothing in there beforehand is a must unless you want shit on your dick, and even then your dick might still have the smell of shit afterwards.      2D girls don't shit unless your fetish is shit.

Anti kyon people will bitch it's a filtered picture or some shit     Gelatinous cubes roam the dungeons, absorbing and dissolving any discarded material.    7 hours until last episode. I seriously hope this ends at least enjoyably, maybe with an announcement for a second season like Chaika. I'll fucking rage if it ends in a "Buy the LN" vibe like many adaptations, especially since Yen press killed off fan translations.     Damn that was a hot doujin    Yes it was, Anon Yes it was     That room looks like it has a nice view. I'd probably put a drawer next to the bed for a alarm clock or some nice figures. Maybe a bean bag for comfiness too.     killed off fan translations  The fuck? How is such a thing even possible?    DHL just rang my doorbell. Good day.    a bean bag for comfiness  Maximum comf.     So drops get cleans in x amount of time. That's how I like my servers, no item lag    I hate you buy fags, supporting the anime we love and all    By DMCAing translator's sites. In a way fan translations are a form of "Piracy". Which people don't really care since it isn't serialized outside the countries they are meant for.  Others drop it because "why bother". Pro translators are getting payed to do it while they would have to do it on their spare time and host it for free. I wouldn't mind it that much if I lived in America, but fuck ordering overseas, never had a good experience with that. Yen Press is also slow to fucking catch up, only the first volume has been released as of the beginning of the year. It will take at least a few years for them to catch up to fan translations by the way things are progressing.         Most translators drop their projects when its contents gets licensed in the US, happens all time for manga too.  That means you're either importing the localized content, which may be costly (especially if you're not murrican, with currency conversions, import taxes and shipping), terribly translated and take years to catch up to japan (assuming it ever do) or get fucked.  Unless for a stroke of luck it's also localized in your country (but as far as LNs goes i think US is the biggest market) or you know moon, but the you wouldn't be here asking for translations i guess.        Bookdepository is a thing if you want to avoid 'murica's insane shipping charges.     DMCA   It's fucking nothing.jpg  Only retards think that has any ability to do anything. Nyaa and torrents exist for a reason.   Dropping when licensed is fucking annoying. I don't understand why scanlators have this rule. Fortunately much less of an issue for me now that I can read raw manga.        I want to gangrape Bell with twin browns    sex with Bell-kun   Faggot.       Only retards think that has any ability to do anything. Nyaa and torrents exist for a reason.  It's a combination of both points, to be able to call a DMCA then that means it has been serialized, ergo point 2.  Dropping when licensed is fucking annoying. I don't understand why scanlators have this rule.  I believe its the fact they'd rather be translating something that people won't be able to get translated in the foreseeable future. Remember, these cunts do it for free, and I have yet to know of someone able to subside solely on donations. Would you rather translate something that you can find only raws of or to waste your time translating things that already have people being payed to translate it? The issue to have should really be translator drama that sometimes pops up.         Caring about laws is what's killing fansubbing, fuking pussies  I dropped this because JCstaff seems to want to throw Hestia into everything.  Hell, she's non-important after vol 2 yet Anime keeps cutting scenes from other characters and putting only hers.  I don't dislike Hestia, I dislike the fact that other characters get shitted on just so the Anime director can fulfill his headcanon of Hestia being important in DanMachi       It's also because of Hestia that the other 10/10 girls barely get any fan art or doujins of, goddamn it Japan.     I believe its the fact they'd rather be translating something that people won't be able to get translated in the foreseeable future.  And if we go back this point :  take years to catch up to japan (assuming it ever do)  When they drop something, it's usually too late for the official release to anything of value. Only the most hard-core fans will wait for the official translations to catch up, with most forgetting about the series by that point. Then there's also the localization issue, which I'd rather not get into, but it's there.  Not entirely sure why I'm arguing this though. Like I said, it doesn't really affect me anymore so I have no reason to argue on this subject.         I remember watching Sakurasou and dropping it on one of the last episodes, only to find out later that they completely butchered it by turning a side character into a main love interest. Why are they allowed to get away with this shit?    No, it's because Japanese have shit taste    I wouldn't really call this an argument since were both arguing for the same thing anyway. Whatever reason. Most translations die the moment they are serialized that's a fact.      It's just JC being shit.  I don't really get it. You know what's worse? Harem LN writers are so fucking beta that he'll probably start giving Hestia attention now that's she's more popular due to the anime. He'll probably stop giving a fuck about the other girls or will just make Bell like Hestia instead of Aiz.       Japan loves Hestia, loves her so much that she already broke 6000 on pixiv. There's 1 pic of a different girl for 20 Hestia's. There's like one aiz doujin and recently one for Aina, the rest is all Hestia. It's their shit taste, anon, that lead to this in the first place.  I think that's already happening, anon. If what some LN anon's say is true then. Bell is actually entertaining the possibility of Hestia as opposed to not even seeing her that way at all.          I think 2 nukes were too much, no taste left    But what if the two nukes are the reason there is any Danmachi?    The irony in all this is that while Japan has the shittiest taste to ever curse someone's palate, they are, at the same time the ones that give us all the best girls and best shows and all that jazz.    If that actually happens, then anime will be the worst thing that has ever happened to manga and LNs. It's bad enough with all of the studios either being Production can't animate for shit, 1courhouse, JC rewrite, and yurishit. The worst part is that they give over half of their budget for a show to worthless VA leeches that would be nothing without the hard work of authors and artists of these series.   Entertaining is whatever. If he ends up with her instead of Ais then JC Staff needs to burn down. Harem end is acceptable too I guess.       So we need a 3rd nuke to get s2?    I was thinking a 3rd and a 4th.    Anon, we are trying to fix the Mongolian puppet shows not eradicate the whole place.    Where is a good place we can nuke japan so their taste will improve? Not the country side, I ♡ non non biyori    Just little nukes. They can't do that much damage.    /a/ suddenly hates Hestia   is this some new meme?     It's summer.     blaming summer for opinions you don't agree with  Nice meme, newfriend :^)     I like this meme better on /sp/    Angry   Has this been one of the best seasons for qt animu grills in living memory?     animeonlyfags      To people with seasonal waifus. .....     There is literally nothing wrong with seasonal waifus.    This show is doing things to my dick   Into a vagina?    post more pics    I'm about to scan it, I'll post later.    Seriously, Drow are shifty cunts.    Dark elf...shiet...      Rape 1st, then she accepted her new master     He'll probably stop giving a fuck about the other girls or will just make Bell like Hestia instead of Aiz.  2ch was pretty much complaining how bells exp boost is basically useless because what happen in vol 8 and how some who bought the LN to read for hestia was disappointed with her lack of relevance and her repetive scenes that they begun to like the other girls instead.     TOTALLY. 100%. MOTHERFUCKING, YES.     raping    elves   Elves aren't for rape, anon.       /tg/ would like a word with you.   Who are some of your most hated/annoying anime characters, /a/?  Anyone? I'm genuinely curious    Sai (Or however you spell her name)- Peach Girl  Vanilla- Sugar Sugar Rune  The green haired alien looking guy in your picture who I can NEVER spell his name right. He was once of the reasons I almost dropped KTMD. What a Jackass,        Entire cast of Toradora.   God damn. I remember her. I couldn't even finish the show cause I hated her character so much.       implying yamazaki isn't the most human nhk     Literaly who tier characters    Yamazaki can be fucking stupid sometimes but I sympathize with him too much.   Nina the table fucker.   Taiga was a real bitch, but what was wrong with the rest of them? I personally enjoyed the show because its one of the few slice of life/romantic comedies that I've seen where they don't end the show without letting you know who's together with who. They actually build up the relationship throughout the entire series and give you the satisfaction of the 2 main characters getting together in the end.    Her and friggin Ougi. Though Nina is less shit at the end.      literally who  Dragonball  Kenichi; the mightiest deciple Welcome to the nhk  Elfen lied  Do you even watch anime? These shows are common as fuck.         This bitch.     He's a Whiny little cunt.     Not liking based Yamazaki.    Literally every child character in any show. They ruin everything.   What was even remotely good about his character?     The fucking kids in Eureka Seven     See<br/>    This.  Also  Dewey was right .     The two retarded comic relief from Erin.   As some anon above posted, I think he the most human, his reactions are full of life, and that is the same reason why he can be a little bitch sometimes, but he was innocent like a child because of that I think he is good character.    Fucking this. If I hear that corny fucking "fire in my belly" line one more time...    The whole cast is utter garbage without exception.    Fuck i can't stand that bitch.    Being the most human doesn't mean we should like him. He's a bitch who constantly complains, exaggerated, and over reacts. Can't stand him.     That's from the dub, I hope you know that.  Honestly, that's not as annoying as believe it; both the English and the original Japanese version are annoying.        Who are you talking about? Sai? I dropped Peach Girl because of her, too.        Elfen Lied   Dragonball   Kenichi  Why would anyone want to watch crap? Sorry for not being familiar with trash.        i don't watch it because it's popular  I can't somewhat understand not liking dragonball and Ellen lied, but kenichi is fantastic.     Can*    Explain to me what she was please. Was she a ghost? Imaginary? Did she wake from her coma? What the fuck was she?    Who didn't like Nishima?    Everyone   Everyone in this show worst show ive ever seen. Idk why old people like it so much.   I was joking at first anon when I said that about not liking him, but being the most human is a possible reason to like a character and I can agree with you on the fact that he was a whiny cunt sometimes, but he was a good person and helped sato a lot, you have to appreciate him as a whole.    If he ended up dying, I honestly think I would be relieved    /a/ has shit taste   Hate this bitch.   Who is that? Can't just have a picture of a shadow and expect everyone to know who that is.    If that is your opinion, there is nothing I can do. At least he is happy in the countryside with his waifu.    I'm terrible with these threads and even I got that one.    This fucking sensei needs to die.    Not everyone has seen the same anime.    That's not true. Pic related is an exception.    Just watch the show.    If you don't recognize the character why even comment? Anyone who's seen Utena would know who that is right away.    Name of show and does it have a dub?    I apologize.    I found her kinda annoying when she became a teen, but yeah, she was adorable as a child    Why does everyone hate Minmay so much? I haven't finished this yet. Seems like only the kind of hatred NTR can induce.     That glasses whore from Nazo no Kanojo X.    She is such a fucking piece of shit, but i do not remember well anon, hasn't she gotten better in the last chapters?    The only thing I remember her doing in recent chapters is telling them off for trying to go to a convenience store during the field trip.   Useless little pussy that is not a good person and doesn't mature in the slightest throughout the series. Only appealing to a shotacon.   There are multiple things incorrect in that post.   In the middle of watching this and it's too damn depressing for me even though it tries to be light hearted and up-beat. On episode 32 I believe and I can't fucking stand nana (not the goth one). At first I felt bad for her guy problems and not being able to find the right guy, but the way she treated nobu and continued to sleep around with that rockstar guy is inexcusable. I hate her character and regret ever feeling bad for her.   She's an indecisive whore that ruins everything.     you're a whiny little cunt. You cunt.     Love you too, cunt.    thats fucking easy    Are you at least 12?     I can name characters I hate, but the thing I really hate are anime purists. People who insult others for enjoying shows that are dubbed in the language that they speak. I personally like watching shows depending on what I think is better whether it's dubbed or subbed. Those People can be so petty and give fans of anime a bad name.   Kill yourself.    I'm gonna assume you mostly hate female characters.    Point exactly.    Are you 10 years old?   This.   Kill yourself.    Forgot pic    That's fine, you're free to do what makes you happy. But you miss a lot of the original humor and context when you watch dubs. You can watch whatever you want, but you're always going to be holding the medium at arm's length when you need it filtered through localization. tl;dr  you'll always be a casual if you watch dubs, it's up to you to decide if you think that's a problem        I thought we were all 10 years old/      talking about mah nigga Yamazaki        Youre just fucking sad, honestly.    We need dubs. There is a large percentage of English speakers who prefer dub over sub, and the more people over here who go out and buy the DVD's or watch anime on tv makes it easier for people to license other anime and bring it over here for more people to see it thus making it more convient to get better dubbed and subbed anime, the more exposer anime gets over here, the more anime we get to watch without waiting months to get shitty fansubs    He's fucking annoying.    To be fair, Kenichi started out fantastic and kinda degenerated into a more generic ecchi shonen  I blame the powercreep and too many gorram teams of characters constantly being introduced.       I find him annoying only after timeskip, since he does not fucking grow up even a little bit, even death of his brother have not changed anything in his character in general, he is one of the most infantile shonen MC I ever saw.      Luffy   Not Usopp or Nami  You know what to do.      Fine. They all fucking suck.     This god damn cock tease. Stop making shit that has half naked girls with big tits in it and never show any nudity. The show is already terrible, at least give me something to look forward to.       your taste is shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii<wbr>iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii<wbr>iiiiiiiiiiiiit</wbr></wbr>   Fuck anything else in this thread. This guy is the worst character of anything.  Couldn't stand either of them in the end(s)   am I crazy or are those i's crossing a spectrum of dark colors, green yellowred violet blue-repeating?    This. I feel your pain.    b..both?   Another drunken whiny whore   Aren't we all      I prefer to not have to deal with any of that bullshit because I started learning Japanese seven years ago. Actually I'd say, the less exposure anime gets over here, the better. Because Western audiences are fucking cancer.        Hating best bro Yamazaki    Every character on this show. Not because of how they act or what they do, but because of the animation and art style. Anime should never use CG animation. It's ugly and it's bad enough every animated movie that comes out over here is corrupted with that shit. I hate it with such a passion. Just fuck the entire show.   The last two really don't fit.    What the fuck do you expect from a series as autistic as Sonic?    You're either viewing this site from an old ass crt monitor or you're on LSD.    You do realize how weeaboo that sounded? Which is complete cancer    I'm just disappointed there has been no good 8man face for this so far.      Dressrosa is going to finish soon   this piece of shit is gonna show up again soon  Maybe he'll be better this time    Only way I'm GXP is if someone took the time to completely edit this character out of it.      Anime fan using weeaboo to describe another anime fan.  This indicates a fan's cognitive dissonance when confronted with aspects of the medium that he cannot interact with due to his lack of understanding of the native language. To make himself feel better the fan will justify that those aspects are not worth experiencing anyway.      SEE WHAT I SEE     Isn't he completely different in the LNs?    I don't like any sonic game or show but the OVA was pretty cool and had beautiful animation. Although the dub was a bit weird. Everyone sounded like they had a cold.    Well I'll be.    You ca love anime without obsessing over japanese culture And criticizing other cultures. That's just retarded.   This cancer   Underrated post.    Yeah the OVA is really great. I like the Japanese cast because the guy who does Sonic is the same guy who voices Tenchi Muyo. Also Knuckes in a sweet ass cowboy had, and Eggman confirmed for lolicon. I have Sonic autism but I just can't watch Sonic X, it's hard for me to watch shows aimed at little kids like that.      Pic related Heroman: Lina Davis Project A-ko: C-ko Ranma 1/2: Akane Fushigi Yuugi: Miaka Sailor Moon: Serena/Uisagi and Sailor Urinous Ayashi no Ceres: Ayi and Toya Love Hina: Naru Naruto: Sakura and Sauske Inuyasha: Inuyasha and Kagome Tenchi Muyo: Ryoko DNAngle: Risa Gundam Seed: Flay Air Gear: Simca Peach Girl: Sae Tenjo Tenge: Aya TTGL: Nia Utena: Everyone except for Juri Macross: Minmay Oreimo: Everyone except for Sasori Toradora: Taiga (anime only) And every overly abusive tsundere archtype cunt in anime.                      This piece of shit.  Also half of the Monogatari cast.     The cowboy hat was pretty badass       expecting good things from some western trash   There's a difference between obsessing over the culture and being interested enough to actually read and learn about it. You must be American, because most Americans despite your obsession with foreigners can't stand to hear any language other than english spoken.       I hated him way more than any bad guy in both seasons,    Idc who she is and what she's done. My dick is ready.    I live in wales, England. Also I don't remember saying anything about just wanting something to be in English     Anime  HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA     Girls with her disposition are made for rape.     DeviantArt the show   Anime  Stop wasting your time with this trash.      To be fair, the creator was a chink.    Fat greedy piece of shit really needs to die.   Any Gary Stu. In animes, they're usually faggots, in which creators self-insert themselves.   So it should be expected that it's trash.    He should have just finished DeadFantasy instead of making some shitty weabo show. Now that he's dead we'll never see the end of that fight.   Basically any overly optimistic annoying little shit.  Ex. Shu from Now and then, Here and There, Gon from Hunter x Hunter     But he's so cute   Fuck this guy for being so awesome     The entire show is shit.     Why was Yuka such a bitch?     Naggy, bitch, obsessive, no personality. Typical annoying female.     Tenchi Muyo: Ryoko  This is a first But on the other hand, FUCK YOU     This faggot. I hate how mean he was to Erio about the aliens thing. If I was in his shoes I'd be plowing Meme and brushing Erio's hair until she falls asleep. I can't stand betafag MCs who act high and might around sexy girls.       Yeah, I know that, but why? Did she have anything going on in her life besides obsessing over her cousin she hadn't even seen in a decade? What an awful character.     Is it sad I've only seen 4 of the shows he's mentioned?    Well some little boys don't understand the allure of a sexy woman.     Fucking whore   Who cares. She's just shit. What I wanna know is why the show has a bad rep? Or so I think. Maybe it's widely loved by people, and I spend too much time reading comments of people's opinions of it on here. Can never listen to /a/'s opinions because most of them are critical Autists who think they could do better.   Could never stand the bitch   Even if you're right, I refuse to ever say anything bad about Lupin the 3rd because I love that franchise so much.    I dont get it, wheres the character you hate? It couldnt possibly be pic related, right?    Hope you're referring to the Japanese version.    Well, these two are even bigger assholes than him To be honest      disliking objectively good things  hipster faggot detected        She's not even attractive. She literally has sonic hair, hangs and sluts all over Tenchi to the point that he tells her to knock it off, and is a fucking shit disturber with Ayeka.   God I fucking hate her. I wish she could be replaced.        Nothing they've done even remotely compares to what this piece of shit has done. Easily the worst character in this thread and should be hated by everyone.    Didn't like the series didn't like the characters    You are entitled to your opinions even if they are disgustingly shitty.    d..do they show the titties?    Only one faggot hates her, she's cute     literally has Sonic hair  Implying that's not a bonus.     Looks like an average anime girl to me.   Kirino.   Is tenchi muyo any good? I seen one of the series on Netflix. Got through 2 episodes and just said fuck when all of a sudden he was in a ship and was going into space for whatever reason. What would you recommend?    I'd recommend you decide for yourself.    Filler shit, no one cares.    But I imagine you are a man with exquisite taste in terms of good anime. I would highly appreciate your delicious opinions.      must.... resist.... flattery Fine, just watch it in the order it was released. The original OVA is a-fucking-mazing.     Tomoko  I don't mind the Watamote manga much, but in the anime she was just horrible. The combination of a whiny VA and them focusing heavily on making sure everyone cringes annoyed me to no end.  I don't even want to sexually fuck her.        all those piercings   No thank you.     She gets wet over metal.  Tomoko is one of the few 2Ds that I love but not sexually. I just want to see her receive affection.      So I'm not the only one. Idk how they did it, but they finally inventors a character I'd never want to fuck. Is that even a good thing?    That pic gives away the most annoying Macross, and it's not Minmay      Is that the one from that pedo manga?    Anime ja nai    ごみだよ。    She doesn't even provide useful insight. Her character is supposed to teach people by being shitty to them, but she's just dicking around.  She has even fewer friends than anyone else.      but...but...she's the best kurismas keku   This guy fully succeeded in being detestable.     Fuck off anon. Toradora is the greatest love story ever told.     Not liking Erza     Such a boring character design. Why do so many anime male characters have long blonde hair? Asians look weird as fuck with blonde hair    That type of character can't have friends    Oh right. I forget that it's considered anime.     kurismas keku  lrn2moon     Sonic X OVA?    Not that anon, but I don't see any problmes there.    Kill yourself.   Not the worst character but annoying as hell. She is also one of the most overrated just for existing.   I hope this isn't just another Shinoafag baiting but I hate her too. She was annoying at first and her fan base is fucking obnoxious and consists of the same circle jerking over and over again. I have never seen one Shinoafag who actually cares about anything else other than her.  Torador            Did you even read part 3?    Not as far as I can remember, but she was a bitch     I dunno, I liked it. Haven't watched it in years, but it was pretty enjoyable.      It's that goddamn noise she makes, holy fuck.   Forgot about this bitch.    He's actually from the UK and a dirty filthy product of it      I've never finished Nichijou because this bitch was si goddamn annoying.     not liking yamazaki   what in the fuck hes literally the best written character in that show      He's a whiny bitch. It's been established in this thread a few times already. I don't care how good he's written. He is annoying. Constantly complaining and over reacting for no reason. I honestly think he's bipolar. He's just completely unlikeable and every time I see him, I want to punch him in the face with brass knuckles with spikes attached to it.    Why don't they ever try to make their characters look different. No matter what, they all got the same sort of eyes.    It is pretty damn good. Sad, but good. It's not often I see violent anime so it was a pleasant surprised.    I enjoyed toradora. Was a cute show. Lot of cliches and annoying characters, but its straight forward and fun.    No. Just Sonic OVA, or Sonic The movie. Even if you aren't a sonic fan, you'll enjoy it. Fantastic music, great art style, beautiful animation, and fun plot.     not wanting to hug hakase  It's time to consider suicide anon.     I wish there were more video game related anime of that level of quality. The time period that ova came out really epitomizes Sonic for me. No bullshit characters, just Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Eggman and Metal.  Amy is debatable.  The Mario ovas are okay but not as good.  tfw no Zelda or Metroid ovas.      Okay gotta say it, you definitely wouldn't want this bitch any where near you  Read the guide: http://buyfag.moe   Resin Cast   ABS  How fragile would this figure be.     Shiki already unavailable in both BiJ and NY   Well shit, where do I get it now?   USA stores are out of the question for me, since they either require immediate payment or the shipping is beyond ridiculous.      Thanks to the anon who posted about the Hobby Search sale.   She is really cute.    I like to reuse my boxes when I ship things to sell because I am a friend to the environment. Not a casual tree killing consumer.

I just found a (very) good deal of one from my waifu and if they're good I'll actually buy her.     All NIB btw.

What do people hope to gain in a situation like that?         sounds pretty alpha to me    It's a /v/ thing. Whenever you tell them to leave they always respond with something along the lines of  I'm staying just because you told me to leave       5k  Not bad.  tfw just bought a set of spoons because my waifu is on one  I need more official merch.        just bought a set of spoons because my waifu is on one   You passed the point of no return a long time ago, isn't it?      Thanks!    I'm pretty sure /v/ has their own ripoff of our buyfag threads anyways, not sure why these fucking retards from /v/ feel the incessant need to shit up /a/ too.    You just need to spend on the best girl   Maki      And /toy/ has plenty of /v/ threads as well. Even one for just Nintendo shit.    Yeah. There's 1 prize figure and a bunch of small time merch so I've bought anything and everything I can find. There's only 1 GK that I've never seen and no proxy has been able to find it for me. Shame because at this point I would pay any amount of money even though I can't into GK.      /v/ buyfag threads are horrendous. Same casual shit, over and over again.     /v/ buyfag threads are horrendous. Same casual shit, over and over again.   So they're a reflection of the board? Who would've thought?     Jeeze it's about time. And this was all for a replacement part from GS.   Do people like her because she sounds almost inhuman?  Everyone else sounds like a typical voice actor in a sound booth. While Maki sounds like someone putting on a fake accent and talking from behind you.     pre-order starts July 1st  Anyone see anything on the Raiden nendo? Saw he has a nude body but am worried it'll be a GSC exclusive   If it is, how shitty would it be to order straight through GSC?       took 50 days for a replacement part to get through customs  What the fuck     Senbonzakura Miku Nendo how much?    It was a new leg part for my Amatsukaze nendo. They must have thought it was some kind of bullet or something.    Deja vu    My only package that's ever gotten lost in the mail was a replacement piece from GSC. No tracking so after a month I emailed them and they sent me another one.    Did they open it?    my only package that's ever gotten lost is things I send to other people on Ebay.    I'm picking it up tomorrow.    I'm still waiting on my RSAL package from AmiAmi after a month. I should probably send them an e-mail.    Why?     After a month   You're fully aware that SAL can take up to 4 months, right?       Yes, but this is as far as it has gotten in that time. My USAL packages consistently take 2 weeks. My last one took 9 days.     Yikes     Yes, but this is as far as it has gotten in that time. My USAL packages consistently take 2 weeks. My last one took 9 days.   It really doesn't matter in what time you usually get them with that shipping method, it can take anywhere from 2 weeks to 4 months, if you send them a mail before that they'll basically tell you to fuck off since the limit time is still far away.      Doesn't matter, they'll just tell you to wait.    I dispatched it, out of my hands anon. Look at my hands! No package, see? Baka gaijin.    LOL'ed    Yeah. That.  Zero, new in box.  Characters I liked? Sorry you don't have a tongue.  $30 shipped.          Email or mfc?     Not "Rook at mai handus anon-san. No pakkegu, shi? Baka howaittu piggu"      LOL'ed  Leave.     Where is the 4 month figure from anyway? Not that I'm arguing but every source I've seen states 5 weeks, Just like 3 months is supposed to be the max for surface.  I know when I had to contact them about EMS they told me to fuck off until it had been a month.      I'll give you 35 for Miku nendo.   Do any of your guys have any serious blu ray collection of anime? I'm talking more than 20 shows.  Most of the shows I would love to own are $50-$120 for the series. The only two shows that I really like and are affordable to me are Watamote and Mysterious Girlfriend X and both of those are just barely below $40. But I enjoy those and would rewatch them again once a year or so.  No...what's the point...I already have them digitally. Blu-ray better quality maybe?  I'm just trying to justify spending money on this. How do you guys justify blu rays?         How much for Red?    Maybe you should learn kana before attempting to imitate Engrish.    Ruku atto mai handosu! No pakkeji, shi? Baka waitto piggu. I think.     Closer but still not completely correct    I know. I tried my best.    You can watch it on the television.   My cat brought me a bird   Let it go    Thanks for sharing. Is it alive? My cats bring me dead rats and occasionally pieces of a bird every couple of days.    Maybe your cat wants you to order some doujin.      <br/>       Car imploded, pls buy burd         isn't it because with delivery services one weeks is actually 9-10 days since you can't count weekends, thus making Monday to Friday (5 days) Saturday, Sunday (that you don't count since they don't work) then Monday and Tuesday (7) to get a week?     Is this your cat?      clothesandfigs@gmail.com   $58 shipped if I can ship in the same box it came in with it being right against the cardboard, $63 if not         Cute     justifying localized  Nigger try buying some Jap BDs.      How much for Tharja and Tell Your World Miku?     I wiill, for today I put it in a cage with water until tomorrow morning.   Though my cat has big fangs, the birds seems to be ok.   yes that's my cat.          How did you know?    Jap BD's? I'm sorry I don't really understand what you mean by that. Like importing them form a Japanese seller? Would they even have english subs?  I don't see anything like this in the buyfag guide.      Yes No      If you need a justification to buy blu-rays you don't even watch then buy the original releases to support the creators directly instead of giving money to some shitty localization hack job.   Watch the rips, keep the BDs.       File width, size, quality and original file name. Here is his Ivy.    Only recently have I started buying JP releases, I've got about 40 volumes of things, about 15 of those are Jap.  I didn't really like spending $60 AUD on a single series, that comes in a crappy box with no extras.  Look for second hand Jap releases, you can find BD sets (maybe minus the collectors box) for rather cheap, and they look great with lots of bonuses.      Impressive    Yes, importing a Japanese blu-ray from Japan. A strange concept I know.    why don't you send him an email?     I going to try this out. Do you guys recommend any sources for Japanese blu rays?   I feel like im being trolled here.   I do appreciate your help though!         I get the feeling that most of us really have too much free time.     I feel like im being trolled here.      They're expensive, but content is better.   CDJapan has bunch of newer releases. Older things will go through manda like everything else or just YJA.       You're so useless that it's moe.    UPS said my package would be here today   check location   its literally the town next over   DELIVERY DELAYED DUE TO SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS, DELIVERY HAS BEEN RESCHEDULED...   mfw it was 78 degrees all day, bright and sunny  I fucking hate UPS so fucking much.        Depends on how many you are buying at once. Check the guide for a list of shops and compare prices.    Thank you. I honestly really only want like 4-5 blu rays for shows that I consider a 8/10 or above but that will probably grow in the future    Nobody wants to work at 78 degrees, it's a fucking sauna.     78   hot  It's California, it's not even humid, it's not even hot due to the sea breeze.  Meanwhile USPS is delivering my Yamato on time.       What kind of fag are you? Would you buy 1 great expensive figure or 2 good figures that cost the same as the great one together?  GSC exclusive bonus is some cutesy stickers.  Neither. I like nendoroids.     Whichever one I want more and appeals to me the most. Why compromise for any reason?    well amiami gave me a warning for missing a payment and now theres an order i want to cancel, wish me luck.   Quality&gt;Quantity    Someone with such poor forethought doesn't deserve any luck.   600mm of giggle inducing silliness.  After what GSC put out I don't think anyone will want Union Creative's Mikasa.   Team Fortress' Heavy x ray version.   Orca has a new bunny girl going up for preorder next week.  I am really looking forward to seeing proper shots of painted Cordelia.   I have literally 52 nendoroids     I'm surprised anyone still gives a shit about this terrible franchise. Everyone bought and sold their collections within the six months.     After the Levi they did I don't think anyone would want her anyways.   Might order 2 just for the arcade   I would buy neither and get art books instead.    Looks good(though I'm not very fond of her bikini's color) there aren't many Chouun's good figures out there.    The best and worst part of this manga for me is that it's kind of a history class on videogames. It's good because it's interesting but fuck it drags on so much.    The amount of merchandise it got so far is pretty astounding. It does seem to be slowing down a bit. Once the second season starts up I wonder how much more we will be seeing.    $70 shipped Tharja $60 shipped Miku  To the anon who emailed me for Miku nendo it's not letting me reply for some reason but $30 shipped is fine but if you wanna pay $35 I won't stop you.       Huh, I thought she wore white? Am I wrong?    It's the sort of thing idiots who don't know anything about buyfagging buy at cons, I guess. aka a large portion of SNK's fanbase.    https://<span>youtu.be/4-h_RLZWvzw  [ ]   We need kof nendos.       Her armor is white. She has it off.    I don't know, it's ugly like the source material.    Wow, rude.   How does TOM have Tenshi so cheap?  Time to cross the event horizon.   The one time /a/nons are being helpful and you think it's a troll.     I agree with you,all my money for some KOF nendos, even I will take KOF Cu-poches       tony taka   doll   the unholiest thing in recent ages.       The great expensive one. I usually buy nendoroids but for a figure which looks amazing I gladly pay more than just two okay ones. Like kotori from alter.    Welcome to the club   Should I buy multiples of amakuni Muramasa? Not sure how rare she'll be.      there are people shilling hotglued figures on this very thread     They even included the silly feet Awakening characters have while in combat.    Fuck off and kill yourself.    What I don't get is why anyone would even post this. It's not "shocking" and hasn't been ever. You're not funny or cool for recording it and posting it on a thread on /a/, and you're even sadder if you saved some faggot hotgluing his figure and then posted it on /a/.    Try eBay. People would pay a lot for them, especially Red and Elsa.    i thought it was moe so i wanted to share     Elsa is 4k brand new most places.      stalking people in an Anonymous image board     It's art anon. Or performing arts.     This saddens me.     Kill yourself.     Scat &amp; Diaperfags rank higher than you dumbasses into hotglue. At least their fetishes aren't huge waste of money     Are you from 6 months ago?       hot gluing unironically      Diapers get pretty expensive, buddy.       tfw going to nippon land in October      tfw can't buy figs due to holiday cost     life is suffering          Why    Reduce,  reuse , recycle. That's what 'ol grandma used to say.    It's just as much "Art" as the retards who make 2 minute walking simulators about gay children running away from home. No, I'd actually consider that more of an artwork than this. Congrats.    Who the hell go to Japan without extra money for the goodies?   Friend go to Nippon with me   Ask if he wanna add more luggage weight   No, I am fine. I will only be sight seeing   End up buying fuck tons of cosplay costumes   Pay more for luggage space on flight back          Is the the birth of an epic new maymay?!  Should I?   Do it. He's best boy.     Tales a shit but he actually looks cute. I would. That stubble and ponytail are great.    Probably, you know you're in trouble when it doesn't show up in another couple weeks.  They might not be inclined to help you until it gets more toward the 2+ month period. Asking them to have the post office look into it sooner probably isn't a bad idea though.  I'm still in the dark about my rsal package from february. Mandarake initiated a search with the post office, but haven't really heard much. I assume it's gone, I just hope I get the 6000 yen insurance or whatever.. It's still a net loss of like 2700 or so which sucks.        But  Karol  is best boy   Anyone wanna take my Wo preorder from BiJ off of my hands?    I dunno anon, most people don't buy large items when their on holiday  i plan on bringing £500 to spend on merc. Which should be enough for what i want.   Did you keep the boxes after you bought them? The size of the box will really limit what you can take back.   I'm told customs is a pain in ass as well.           finally got 1k in the bank   considering blowing it all on figures  Sorry for the minor blog but jesus christ what a slippery slope.      Think about the comming years and figures. If you buy now a lot of shit you maybe wont have enough room for things you woll enjoy more in the comming year. Only buy stuff which you really really like and think about it for a few days before ordering.      I'm glad I'm a picky motherfucker.     I've answered personal ads on craigslist for figure money more than once. You don't know the real struggle.     If I were a cute gril, I'd have as many stds as figures.    safe some money for upcoming years. At least wait for wonfest for the time being       If I were a cute gril, I'd have as many stds as figures.  You could remove cute and you'd still have the same result. There are some desperate people looking for any female to fuck.     just blew $2,500 on a computer   grail pops up on manda   Is this hell?       spending 25k on a comp  What the fuck anon. A good one shouldn't cost more than a grand, tops.     He said 2.5k not 25K     I dunno anon, most people don't buy large items when their on holiday  i plan on bringing £500 to spend on merc. Which should be enough for what i want.   Did you keep the boxes after you bought them? The size of the box will really limit what you can take back.   I'm told security is a pain in ass as well.          muh 4k gaymin     2.5k on a PC   The fuck are you doing. A high tier one that will last you 5 years minimum (at which point you would only need to change the GPU) cost you 1.3k tops.    inb4 I got an Allienware!         Oh sorry, forgot to mention I live in Australia. The Land of Double-Priced Computer Parts.     See   My life really is hell.        Holy shit anon you just made my nose twitch     I automatically typed 25k and meant anime dollars, sorry.  My condolences.       My condolences.      Th-Thanks.    <span>youtube.com/watch?v=w5KRawOXy4U  [ ]   Oh come on, it's not that expensive. You way over future proofed if the specs were actually worth that much.   Amakuni Muramasa or Hestia?    I also bought an expensive as fuck monitor for all my anime needs.      noice      Hestia is FoTM everyone will forget by the end of the year, Momohime is guarantied to stay popular just like she has been for years and her figure will most likely skyrocket after release just like the last one. Your choice in the end though.      Surprisingly enough, that was quite interesting.    What do you currently have in the mail, or is just about to ship?     Absolutely nothing because of delays again.    Day 1 PO     Instant pre-order.     preorder starts tomorrow when the final episode of UBW anime airs.    Any word if this is exclusive or not yet?     not chloe  Why     It's Aniplex+Stronger, which means it's exclusive.     How come Stronger is releasing prototypes and then the painted version so fast yet other manufactures can take year. That Rin was announced just a month ago, it can't get faster than that.     Aniplex+Stronger   What do you think.           Fuck that spin-off piece of shit. I want an actual Illya scale, not magical girl nonsense which is all we're getting that to that shit.     figma Snake figma The Thinker figma Criminal/figfix Conan Cu-poche Hibiki Ganaha Cu-poche Dark Magician Girl         Literally whom?      part of me wanted to believe     All three with SAL, so won't see any of them for another week or so.     That's not bad if you live in USA as your local retailers will have her for cheaper than BiJ/NY.   If you live in  Mexico  like me then you're fucked since 90% of those figures aren't available here from any USA store or if it is they charge ridiculous shipping fees. I talking about shit like 7k for a fucking 1/8 that weights 1kg.      Tell me experienced buy fags, I want the following.   a girl dressed in gothic lolita fashion   not a "stick in the mud" personality   from a somewhat decent anime   Ever since I played no more heroes 2 when I fought Margaret Moonlight I had a bit of an obsession with the fashion, and I want me a statue or a somewhat decent figure of one.  My problem is none of pic related exist and most characters I've seen seem just boring, only one that got my interest up was kurumi tokisaki from date a live, but one problem   only in stock brand new is her sexy kotobukiya statue   The hair cover thing is cute but the statue I want of her is long out of stock, I actually don't want anything sexy I just want something respectable, anyone willing to help find a thing that isn't from china or isn't a heavily marked up second hand thing?  As for what I got myself recently just mp-10 convoy, figma snake, bishujo psylocke x force costume (impulse purchase I kinda regret, gonna stack her at the rear of my collection) and unite warriors superion.  I might be a guy but seeing something like this on my bed side would just be nice, for once something refined as opposed to robots, manly men or overly sexy characters.  Anyone willing to help a guy who has no idea?                     You already asked, everyone already told you Hestia a shit. Now stop.    Fuck off    D-style Burglary Dog some pre-owned Ymir fig     Read guide. Check tags on mfc for whatever you are looking for. Also read the guide.     Fuck tons of Alter figurines getting reissue.   So, are they declaring bankruptcy soon?      Which?     Why wouldn't they, it's easy money for them. Don't have to pay for a new sculpt, just reuse old molds.    I was just asking for help, but ok, I get it.  I should of guessed too many stuck up princesses are here, I just thought someone might like to help a guy choose something other than what a friend suggest.  I'll just go do what my friends suggest and get me that kotobukiya hestia, thanks.   Links not working, where I am is blocking it and its honestly quite annoying, but thanks, I'll read the guide in 2 months time when I'm back in australia, hopefully our government doesn't censor this place, where else can I get hands on user experiences, youtube sucks and photos without commentary suck.  I do thank you personally though, its common sense to read the guide but its just not working, nor is facebook  or reddit, think the hotel where I am went over kill with the internet filter .  I should of mentioned it first I suppose but I guess I thought people are nicer on /a/, first guy shown me this place's true colors, I'll be gone now so feel free to make fun of me, cheers                Or they could ruin shit in re-release like with Shizuo and Izaya     Horizon Kazuno, Dress Code Saber, Suguha's sugus.   Just to name a few.      You sound like you belong to reddit.    Go back to your hugbox fag.     friends   Hestia   facebook   reddit  This is an 18+ website.          Here we go.    I don't understand the Gisen Yagyu re-release since I saw her going for 3500 yen   Worst show(s) of 2015 so far?    kekkai sensen    These are only meme posts to make other upset because the shows are popular, since there are genuinely objectively worse anime airing than Kekkai Sensen and Euphonium.     Kekkai is not that popular here for some reason. If he wanted to bait he'd use Hibike and Yahari.     meme posts   <br/>     Gunslinger Stratos   Those two are bad, but nowhere near the worst. Neither are Triage X level, for example   I can live with OP's choices.  Triage X and whatever the fuck that ninja show is called.    implying    Hibeki /u/phoric because it's k-on 2.0 and all the shitty threads it's spawned  Denpa Kyoushit Triage X Isuca    Favorite Yuri?   Very introspective?   Chinatsu, a.k.a. the only actual lesbian in the series.  Also Chitose, at least when she's not getting nosebleeds, because she's the sexiest.      the only actual lesbian in the series.   That might be why I hate her so much, other than her being a soulless bully.      Because the actual reason she ended up leaving alone was because her father molested her and the family wanted to sweep it under the rug. Out of sight, out of mind.   As a result she has some issues.      Ayano is pretty explicitly a lesbian as well.   What happened to Mo-tan to become so tiny? Did she only manage to reincarnate partially?  Is she not part of the zodiac anymore then?     Why the fuck would she be traveling around the world with Nya-tan in the first place, doesn't she have the whole Tokai region to protect?   inb4 it turns out there WAS somebody that missed Rat's radar and won all the Eto-seals in the last moment to become an Eto-shin.    Hooray Paca-tan          Her soul got ripped out and shattered. Give her SOME time to heal    she's on sick leave   what I want to know is Pretty Mode tiny in general or is Mo-tan just like that because of the aforementioned soul ripping          Rabbit? More like RabBest.   Well there's the manga.  Which deviates so much from the anime that it is practically a different story just with characters that look the same    You're early today      I, for one, welcome our new CG overlord.    well that is smaller but hardly pocket sized     Nya-tan is travelling the world to find a cure to restore mo-tan's body.  Mo-tan is too weak to protect a region and just tags along with Nya-tan.   season 2 never indeed        Boar is best  Reminder that Meitan was confirmed best girl last thread.    Mission accomplished     I feel sad for you Sheepfags since she gets BTFO in manga    So, uh, did they explain what the deal is with Takeru? Did I miss something?   What was wrong with him?    He was just a small town boy    I'm still wondering how he's able to barf out Sol/Lull like it's no big deal.     does anyone else feel like the ending was a tease for second season/OVA where they will have 3D segments with more realistic body proportions just like in OPs pick?  it felt like that to me.   muh sales!   there are plenty of low-sales shows that get second seasons or OVAs           List a few  because I would like to believe      there are plenty of low-sales shows that get second seasons or OVAs  Because they are for promoting the source material. If the publishers think an anime increased the sales of manga, VNs, or merchandise, even if the anime itself sold badly, they will consider it a success.  Etotama was just a commercial disaster.      Now my ears can rest in peace and heal from Nya's voice.    Etotama was just a commercial disaster.  Exactly. And it makes me fucking happy.     You could marinate a whole cow with such saltiness  not that it would be difficult now that Mo-tan has become chibi     Living in a lonely world?    Why chuu-tan looks so HIGH.    Because Murakawa subconsciously hates Rat  or her VA  deep inside     Not anymore, he has a floor boar, a monkey and a dog on his roof, a horse and a sheep taking care of his home, a tiger and a dragon keeping him company, a rooster waking him up in the morning, a snake cooking for him, a cat with a cow, and a rabbit occassionally visiting him, and now he also acquired a sexy loveable rat who hangs around him to relax. Must be awesome having such great Soul/Lull.       Shitty drawings being showcased in anime is my biggest hnnnngggggghhhh    Well that was cute.  /a/ sure is slow tonight. post the edgiest manga pages.     Manga?    ITT: People who don't know what edgy means    It's only edgy out of context    Shokugeki No Souma    wow this guy shot her head back into one piece   This has a lot of these moments really.   He actually did though.....  go read Fushi no Ryouken      no, dont go read it. its irredeeemable shit.    Edgy things are fun. I want edgy highschool manga that doesn't try to dress it up in emotional turmoil. Like Daimaou.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127198932   Boku no Pico.       This is what I call edgy    not even his final edge       Alright I have to read this for a good laugh.     Something Seraph    This is 3edgy5me    Stabbed so hard snot came outta her nose.    to edge even for me.   Enough edge here.      New edge never     ?   This manga hates cute girls.        ITT /a/nons misuse the word edgy, repeatedly.   wait, her whole head was magically healed? I'm so confused     The majority of the population is immortal, when they die they just come back to life fully healed.     How about grim? Is that acceptable?   Grimdark would be the most accurate. Grimdark is an actual subgenre of fiction that most of the things people on /a/ refer to as "edgy" would fit into. Edgy means something completely different.    Edgy has no concrete meaning, or well if it did, it doesn't anymore. Probably one of the better examples of a buzzword.    This part in the anime made me piss myself.     Edgy means something completely different.  You know words can have multiple meanings and uses can change over time. it's not like the edgy, as in cutting edge ore iconoclast use was devoid of grim subject matter to the point of just being shock value.     Grimdark is when there is no light whatsoever.   Why are his hands and arms wrapped.   series ended with him getting his arm cut off. they grafted white zetsu guys arm onto him. same for sasukes arm. maybe he doesnt like the look of it so always wraps it?   He'll unwrap it and reveal that its covered with Sharingan eyes just like Danzo did   Nasty white clone flesh prosthetic. He covers it up so as to not look too weird. Everyone covers everything in bandages in that manga anyway.     The more important question is:  Why he fuck does naruto have whiskers?      In Kishimoto's original idea he was a cub of the fox demon that was killed while wrecking the village. Naruto could turn into a human but have the whiskers as telling signs.     Influenced by the Kyuubi during gestation      Can't he shave?    So do you guys feel like Sarada's character is weakened if her mommy issues turn out be nothing?  I can see the argument on both sides, but I feel like her character is a bit stronger if she's actually Karin's. But given that there's only one chapter, I can't see how they could wrap up everything in a way that favors Karin being her birth mother.      they are birth marks, anon     Sasuke never took the new arm.      Explaining away the DNA would need more than a chapter.  Sarada being told that Sakura's barren and Karin donated an egg would take a page, maybe two with her reaction.     Given how his laser skeleton's size seems to vary and he has in the past conjured ust parts of it it's not like he can't magic up an arm for himself whenever he wants to, anyway.     Sasuke the protagonist.   Implying he won't have 10 seconds of screen time again.      They are birth markings like a mole.     I don't like the surrogate theory. It doesn't really make much sense.      It doesn't really make much sense.  It fits Sarada having Karin's DNA without needing to go into detail of how she went and stole a fucking umbilical cord. It fits the theme of inheritance v. blood relations. It makes sense.  The only alternative is the clone/experiment, which is plain silly.         No, she learned the lesson and faced her feelings towards her parents, I don't see how the moral that two options are equal can be weakened by not having a specific one.     Sasuke just having sex with Karin is a much simpler explanation than trying to make sense of why Sasuke or Sakura would ask for Karin's help in conceiving a child.      Sasuke just having sex   simple explanation      I don't think it would take more than one or two panels to explain Karin having their material.  You helped us deliver the baby and without you here Sakura would die, please keep Sarada's umbillical cord as a memento of our appreciation to you.      Sasuke having sex or even a sex drive is plain wrong. I can sort of buy him doing his duty to the clan enough times to conceive a child, but not much more. With a barren Sakura on the one hand, and a ridiculously loyal weirdo who'd do anything for him, what is he to do?      A popular writer in a Japanese publishment writing a story for little boys in which a good character with a wife goes away and has sex with another woman is quite hard to explain.    this is true, but Kishi was plainly cuck-baiting as early as the final chapter of the main series, and anybody with half a brain could tell.  it's not as if teasing the plot is that much better than the cuckening actually happening.       I don't see how the moral that two options are equal can be weakened by not having a specific one.   Well, it's weakened because a character going to save their biological mother is perfectly natural, it doesn't exactly show that Masashi Kishimoto's philosophy as spoken through the mouthpiece of Naruto's character is true.  The anons who keep insisting it doesn't matter only insist it doesn't matter because they're only thinking about whether Sarada is happy by the end, they're not thinking of how well the story conveys its own philosophy to potentially ignorant readers.        Don't know about Salad's character but the lesson would be negated and useless if she turned out to be Sakura's daughter after all.    Oh really?   fuck off.    I'm going to cover the face of my midwife in this old photo with my own face.     There doesn't have to be any explicit reference to sex you know. Besides, shonen manga reference sex in "safe" ways all the time.       What's the source on next week being the last chapter?   That photo gave me paranoia months ago.   The woman behind him   She knows.        But by saying it's weakened by not having Karin as her mother you're onyl proving that it does matter, that by default it shouldn't work out and this precidence stands out. I always hated these kinds of morals in any show, honestly, it just doesn't work, if you have to go out of your way to say two things are equal then that surely means they are not supposed to be equal.    Well there is no other picture of Sasuke and those family frames are kinda made with same size in mind.     The only alternative is the clone/experiment, which is plain silly.   You do realize what you are reading, right?       please keep Sarada's umbillical cord as a memento of our appreciation to you.  In Nip culture that's just not something you fucking give away as a memento to a third party.  The parents take care of it because it's believed to be tied to the well-being of the child, and they eventually give it to the kid.  I mean I'm sure Kishi could kishilogic his way out of that but still, it'd be weird.         His arm is full of sharingans.    Since the arm is made with senju genes, those got to be rinnegans.    And how much of a shitstorm that chapter caused, even for Joseph who always was a wild card and a pervert people still said that was going too far. For Sasuke with his stern asexual demeanor that's otright impossible.    He has a normal flesh colored arm. He chooses to keep it wrapped up as a reminder to his final battle with Sasuke.    I'd actually reckon it'd be cool if he built an Edward-esque mecha-arm with kunai and shuriken and shit stored in it. Because he's not enough of a special snowflake.    He can do that via Rinnegan already.    Susanoo is always giant, anon. He literally can't do that. It's not like the tailed beast arms that Naruto could use. Sasuke's a one-armed shinobi and still a complete angsty badass. Although Naruto's new arm is pretty cool too, if only for anime aesthetics.    In what way?     But by saying it's weakened by not having Karin as her mother you're onyl proving that it does matter, that by default it shouldn't work out and this precidence stands out.   I think you're looking at this in terms of real life too much and not in terms of storytelling and its generally accepted rules. If you're a writing a story with the intention of propagating a particular worldview over and against an opposing viewpoint, then you have to assume that your readers are either totally ignorant or in doubt that they need to be reassured or convinced that your worldview is true.   it just doesn't work, if you have to go out of your way to say two things are equal then that surely means they are not supposed to be equal.   But they're not equal, not in terms of actual storytelling. If you're going to use a story as a platform for preaching a particular philosophy, then even if the moral is about "equality," not all examples you can use are equal. Also, for the record, I don't think this story was really about "equality" at all. It was more about how love transcends blood relation, and this driven home a lot better for a potentially ignorant or confused readership by an adopted Sarada who is more attached to her adoptive mother and mentor more than either of her birth parents.          I remember the size changing, though. Sometimes the ribcage is just big enough to have him fit inside, sometimes it holds three people easily.     That's a bit anti-climactic though, ain't it?     We are talking about Naruto, are we not?    The trailer shows he will have at least 10 mins.     I don't think the lesson would be negated, I just agree with what others have said about it being a more weak representation of Naruto's philosophy. Maybe Masashi Kishimoto is content with it being like that, but it does lessen the quality of the Gaiden as a piece of propaganda.  It'd be like if I was making Nazi propaganda films that preached about the glory of the pure white aryan race and the hero was only half-white.       Hm, yeah, I guess I am looking at it from the worng side.Maybe it does weakens the story, but it can still work if she never finds the truth, like she'll just say she doesn't care anymore and get on with her life thinking Karin's her mother but love connects her with Sakura and then it's just Sasuke and Naruto talk about it to reveal for the audience, but then that would be kinda stupid.     Sasuke and Naruto talk about it to reveal for the audience, but then that would be kinda stupid.   If the next chapter is the last one this is exactly how I see it going down.  I think Karin made Salad with her and Sasuke's DNA to so they could be a family, but Sasuke refused and Karin gave her up to Sasuke.        Sasuke can just make an arm out of lightning if he needs to do things that require two hands, like holding his newborn daughter.     The way I could see it playing out, assuming the story won't reveal the dna test was a fluke, is either Naruto and Sasuke will have their talk and we won't know what they say and Sarada drops the issue, leaving it all up to the reader to decide what they believe is or should be the case, or Sasuke will be implied to have had actually had a brief relationship with Karin, but it will be toned down for the rating and to save the most amount of pages  I doubt Sasuke would actually say "yeah, I stuck it in crazy, and it was a huge mistake" but I could see them glossing over any explicit references to sex while still having him explain that Karin "gave birth to her." Keep in mind, they've never actually said any of the parents have had sex to produce their kids, it's just something those of us who know how kids are made naturally assume.  One of the false assumptions I've seen here since this thing began has been that in order for Sasuke to explain how Karin is the mother he would need to actually say he had "sex" with Karin. All he has to do is confirm she's the birth mother, he doesn't have to give us any juicy details, you know?         More like 1 minute.      Sasuke   holding his daughter       Even Vegita held trunks.     Vegeta was there for his kid.     Kind of easy when you don't have a job.  The irony being is that he hugged him while he was on the job.        Sasuke   having a job   His "job" consisted of walking around a forest for twelve years waiting for the plot to find him as he played ninja candy crush on his phone         &gt;holding his daughter    Even Vegita held trunks.    Vegeta was there for his kid.    Kind of easy when you don't have a job.  Vegeta didn't have a job and also had 2 arms. Sauce doesn't have either.   The irony being is that he hugged him while he was on the job.  I see what you did there               In the current ninja economy any work is welcomed.      here's my kid with that other woman   I need to leave to do an important "job"   it's probably better if I never come back   be right back.   yeah, Sasuke is full of it. We all know what his top secret mission has been.            and that's how your mom got pregnant Sarada      The DNA thing could easily be explained away by it being Sasuke's DNA. It's not out of character for her to keep that as some kind of weird trophy.    But the sample given was from Karin's umbilical cord.       You would assume that the technology they used could differentiate between the father's genes and the mother's genes.     Kaguya was revealed first in Storm 4 than she was in the anime    I wouldn't assume Kishy knows how those tests work. And neither do I, in my mind you just put two examples of DNA in and it shows if there's a match.    Except even modern DNA tech can be iffy on the subject of identification, and they ran a check for "does it match," not, "is it female." Also, what with Karin's known tastes and with Sharkboy at the helm, an element known to cock things up, it's more or less guaranteed that the sample was Sasuke's hair, so the match was a misid. It'll probably have some cute little scene of "I don't have to be related by blood to call you my family," then running another test and showing the sample was wrong. Because fucking Naruto.   As far as the wrapped arms, he lost one as a result of series finale, and he also suffered permanent damage from Kyuubi's removal and from the strain of battle. Basically, for the same reason as Rock Lee, it's just not a pretty sight underneath.    it's more or less guaranteed that the sample was Sasuke's hair   hair   black vs bright red    Suigetsu is certain the item is from a birth   I know people here doubt Suigetsu's intelligence but he's not a fucking contestant in the Special Olympics.         Naruto games are making very large money nowdays.  Probably more than the anime.      If it was a hair, even Suigetsu would know if it was Karin's or not. Black hair=not Karin. He at least has the deductive reasoning to know that. So obviously if it was hair, then he would know for certain if it was Karin's.  Now, if it's an umbilical cord, it'd be hard to explain how Karin got a hold of Sasuke's or Sarada's, even if it was Karin one was talking about.  Suigetsu seemed to know how all this technology worked. He wasn't bumbling around trying to figure out how to program a VCR.         Considering the scene was uncolored and Suigetsu was saying how the hell does he operate it, that seems to be opposite the case.     Suigetsu was saying "how the hell does he operate it"   Are we reading the same manga? He only struggled to find Karin's sample.       I don't remember him showing any incompetence in performing the test.      Considering the scene was uncolored  How the living fuck have people commented on the Uzumaki red hair color multiple times in-universe if they're only capable of seeing in black and white?   Suigetsu was saying how the hell does he operate it  He showed a level of uncertainty about the source of the DNA in Karin's desk but he never once questioned how to operate the machine. He even took the DNA sample used specifically in parental testing (Buccal swab). You have Alzheimer's or you're baiting.           I can sort of buy him doing his duty to the clan enough times to conceive a child, but not much more.   Did Sasuke even want to revive the Uchiha? I feel like Sasuke simply wanted to restore its honor and after his redemption and seeing everything the Uchiha clan is capable of doing, I wouldn't be surprised if he actually never wanted a kid. It would explain some of his cold and impersonal demeanor around his own daughter.  Putting aside the issue of who is Sarada's mother, I find it harder to believe that Sasuke would even want a child.         I feel like Sasuke simply wanted to restore its honor  He did, which is weird because until he started all that shit Uchiha's reputation was very high.      Putting aside the issue of who is Sarada's mother, I find it harder to believe that Sasuke would even want a child.  And there in lies the greatest problem that SS fangirls face; they are in love with a guy who clearly doesn't want to fuck.  The entire drama they built up all these years and through out the gaiden, revolve around the undeniable fact that Sasuke had no sexual desires whatsoever. That might have seemed "cool" in the beginning, but SS eventually realised it was going to be a problem. All the argument about Salad's maternity all boils down to "Sasuke needed to have fucked!". This despite overwhelming evidence that no matter how many times Sasuke confirms that he cares about his family and declares Sakura his wife, it still seems like he skipped the honeymoon stage. He went straight from being single, to married with children and away from home. SS needed that missing stage, that "madly in love and fucked like rabbits" stage, which Sasuke just couldn't provide. They got what they asked for, what they deserved.       The Uchiha are not a sensible family. Or at least the ones domesticated by Tobirama aren't.     Sasuke felt like the entire village was laughing at him and his clan. see pic     And there in lies the greatest problem that SS fangirls face; they are in love with a guy who clearly doesn't want to fuck.   Really, I can believe that he did it at least once in his life.  What I can't believe is that he would actually want a child, especially after seeing just how evil and dangerous his clan can be and losing his own family in such a traumatizing fashion, having been driven to insanity over it. And I think the problem with the Sakura/Sasuke fanbase is that they probably assume that Sasuke deep down just wants to have tons of vanilla sex with his wife and raise a whole bunch of Sakura spawn.  Does anybody seriously believe this guy would be enthusiastic about being a father to more cursed Uchihas and starting another family he could potentially lose? It's already a bit out of character for him to be married at all.               Not domesticated, rather.     mere shit-tier Sharingan   not Madara's superior Rinnegan       Suigetsu THINKS it's Karin's.  Also, while technology might distinguish between mother and father, it's far from obvious that Suigetsu could know where to look for that information.       Does anybody seriously believe this guy would be enthusiastic about being a father to more cursed Uchihas and starting another family he could potentially lose? It's already a bit out of character for him to be married at all.  This is why I am a supporter of "Karin made a baby in a vat" theory. It would be in character that Sasuke doesn't want a child, but if he was GIVEN a child he would want it taken care of. But since he never planned to have a kid, it would make sense that he isn't any good at being a father.  All the cucking jokes on /a/ just confuses the issue. No one truly believe Sasuke had enough sexual desire to fuck, let along enough effort to cheat. What we see so far fits the image of Sasuke not wanting a family, but now that he was forced to have one he tried his best to deal with it. A+ for good intentions and D- for result.        Also, while technology might distinguish between mother and father, it's far from obvious that Suigetsu could know where to look for that information.  Enough about that. Their genetic tech is many times more advanced than ours.     No, he's just lost in a forest and can't use GPS since his phone died and he didn't bring a charger.     This is why I am a supporter of "Karin made a baby in a vat" theory.   another bombshell like that would require at least two more chapters. There's no way you can force Sarada to deal with the "fact" that Sakura isn't her mother within the course of two to three chapters and then drop that she isn't even a natural child to boot and resolve that in the course of a single chapter.   No one truly believe Sasuke had enough sexual desire to fuck, let along enough effort to cheat.    Sasuke having sex with Karin doesn't mean Sasuke cheated on anyone because Sasuke may not even been married at the time. Secondly, where is this impression coming from that Sasuke is some kind of alien with no sex drive at all? It's more believable that he just rarely has sex than he doesn't have sex at all. I can understand the interpretation of him being asexual when he was on his darkness binge, but there's nothing to say the redeemed Sasuke wouldn't be more receptive to either Sakura or Karin's affections, even if he was really awkward about it.  I can more easily believe the guy had sex one time in the last 14 to 15 years since he stopped being a psychopath than I can that he's some kind of sexless eunuch.             Sasuke having sex with Karin doesn't mean Sasuke cheated on anyone because Sasuke may not even been married at the time.  I bet they were on a break with Sakura.     Back to the nineties you.   Sauce has been on a break with Sakura for 12 years.        another bombshell like that would require at least two more chapters.  Not really, the ability to make whole humans in a vat was already demonstrated in the early chapters of the gaiden. The point is my argument takes into account the entire arc and what happened in it.   Secondly, where is this impression coming from that Sasuke is some kind of alien with no sex drive at all?  Because he never had any sex drive at all, EVER. Give me any moment when Sasuke was interested in a woman sexually or was arounsed, at any time, from either the manga or the gaiden, and I would believe otherwise. Even in the Gaiden he never treat Sakura as a lover, but as a wife. This isn't conjecture, this is just the way it is. Compared to Naruto who repeatedly had shown interested in women.          Just saiyan. Sasuke may not have married Sakura until after it came to his attention he had a child as a result of some "yeah, sorry" sex he gave Karin.     But his feeling towards here were established in 699 when he poked her in the head. From that point on it counts as they are together.     he poked her in the head  Does that mean hitachi and sauce were a couple too?     It meant they love each other, head poking is literally only expression of love Sasuke knows.    That would be Sarada.  Sasuke even gets to lead a mission to rescue Naruto from the aliens.     So they're not gonna adress the question of where the fuck did Shin get kamui ability? His own mangekyo is just weapon telepathy, that spiral warp is definitely Obito's.   You only notice that now?     Not really, the ability to make whole humans in a vat was already demonstrated in the early chapters of the gaiden.  It took 1 chapter for the DNA test reveal to be set up and another chapter for Naruto to use TnJ to persuade Salad into accepting Sakura as her mother.  I agree with the other anon that even if human experimentation has a big precedent in this manga, it's one thing for Salad to be shaken up about being adopted. It'd be another beast altogether for her to learn that she is not even a naturally created human that was the product of love between two individuals, rather she's an experiment created by a psychotic stalker that was later dumped like a hot potato on an unknowing couple.  The preview for next week's chapter even says that it's going to be about Salad graduating the academy. Even for Kishi it'd be a fucking feat to pull off all that other aforementioned shit in ~19 pages.        Will we find out why Shin thinks he's Akatsuki and why he holds Sasuke as a cunt because he 'killed' Itachi?    I agree with the other anon that even if human experimentation has a big precedent in this manga, it's one thing for Salad to be shaken up about being adopted. It'd be another beast altogether for her to learn that she is not even a naturally created human that was the product of love between two individuals, rather she's an experiment created by a psychotic stalker that was later dumped like a hot potato on an unknowing couple.  What is a "natural" human anyway? In the Naruto universe being unnatural is practically a divine gift. Naruto himself is a walking ball of unnaturalness.    So is Gaiden supposed to be only 10 chapters?  When's the movie premiering anyway?     Not really, the ability to make whole humans in a vat was already demonstrated in the early chapters of the gaiden. The point is my argument takes into account the entire arc and what happened in it.   It's not a question of ability. You already forced Sarada to deal with her mother not being her real mother and it's still something she's dealing with. You plan on adding another twist that she technically doesn't even have a birth mother? The next chapter is the resolution, you're not going to have anymore dramatic reveals like that. The babyvat theory is dead in the water. Sasuke had sex, just deal with it, man.   Because he never had any sex drive at all, EVER. Give me any moment when Sasuke was interested in a woman sexually or was arounsed, at any time, from either the manga or the gaiden, and I would believe otherwise   He doesn't need to. The more reasonable conclusion is that he's merely emotionally and physically distant, not that he's sexless. The problem is you're presenting a false dilemma here where either Sasuke is either passionately interested in sexual relationships or he has no such interest in them at all. But while there's no case of him showing any sexual interest in a woman, it doesn't mean he wouldn't ever, even after he's let go of the things that are responsible for his lack of interest to begin with.          I naturally created human is one that was made simply by 2 people fucking.     head poking is literally only expression of love Sasuke knows.  Then how did he ever become a father?      There's only one chapter left. Even if we assume that it's going to be an extra long chapter, there's no way they would have enough time to introduce and deal with a test tube baby problem.  Either Masashi Kubo is going to leave it all open for the reader to decide or he's going to reveal that Sasuke had sex with either Sakura or Karin to produce Sarada. The simplest explanation is Sasuke had sex just once and Kishimoto doesn't even need to explicitly say he did that to confirm who the mother is.       Yes. But knowing how to operate a machine doesn't mean knowing how to read correctly the results.  The details of the analysis, including whether the parent was father or mother, might well have been displayed only on request and Suigetsu never even thought of checking     NURUTARD U R U T A R D            Yes. But knowing how to operate a machine doesn't mean knowing how to read correctly the results.  You are assuming a scientist who had been working in the same lab for a DECADE does not know how to operate his own equipment. That is definitely reaching.       implying he didn't poke Karin in the head too.      Tenten really was the star of that series.    He mostly poked her in the chest     There's only one chapter left. Even if we assume that it's going to be an extra long chapter, there's no way they would have enough time to introduce and deal with a test tube baby problem.  That's what I said     Except Suigetsu isn't a scientist     I know, I was agreeing with you      Except Suigetsu isn't a scientist  After a decade working in Oro's lab, yes he is.     Ah I can never tell on this site       That's not all he poked apparently.      more important question is, Does Lee really procreated asexually or he managed to get 10/10 pussy?    wake up   check /a/   still no news about Hunter x Hunter  send help     Next time I see HxH news on /a/ I'll probably have a heart attack from shock. I feel for the people who've been following it for a long period of time, hiatuses are really painful.   last update: september 2014   What wicked plans have she conjured up?

Yui, no doubt about it.       I dunno I guess it largely depends on what you think Yui's role in the story     I fucked up ;_;       It's like she is mere martyr for them.  One of the core themes of the show is that it's natural for people to hurt others sometimes, even if they don't want to, in order to do what's best for themselves.  8man is only just now learning to deal with this. Yui is the only person who up until now has been fully protected by Yukino.  Do the math.          Hourly reminder Yukino doesn't love 8man, she is pretending.   EVERY SECOND I WASTE IS MORE THAN I CAN TAAAAKE   what expression is this face trying to convey?   HURRRRR      The pleasure of being cummed inside.     BE MORE LIKE ME AND BE LESS LIKE YOU   Yukino's character development in a nutshell.     The Yuigahamas should get permission from the Yukinoshitas to let Yukino stay at their place. Best place for healing.   tfw no sequel OVA with 8man going to Yui's house again to meet her father after she win  Why even live?     Yui is the only person who up until now has been fully protected by Yukino.   You got it reversed. Yui smooth things over so that Yukino won't stumble.     It feels like Yukino is the subject of 90% of the hate in these threads.  I'm not going to say anything about that other than thank you to all the people out there who stay true to their ships without bashing others.     I'd honestly be happier than a pure Yui end. All three of them have love in their hearts for one another, so why can't that turn into something more than friendship on all fronts?  Also see  that some guy just dropped in the last thread.      its the IRC actually, remember when there was one dude pushing hard the 8man is a gary stu meme? it didn't work out so they are attacking the waifufags also the dude that spams cunt is one of the irc lackeys     Yukino just hit her lowest point ever this volume. No wonder people are going to use that against her and her ship.      why can't that turn into something more than friendship on all fronts?  Penguins have only one partner for life anon. It's not genuine if nobody gets hurt. Ideals are just that, ideals; they're not real.      You guys think associating Yukino with Linken Park is bad, but their songs are good.  Jokes on you.      implying there's no Yukinofags who're also get entertained by Yukino's suffering.    I miss the old Yahari threads   Reminder that Yukino is blind and Hayama was her first bully      [Novel] やはり俺の青春ラブコメはまちがっている。 第11巻 [Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy ha Machigatteiru. vol 11]    What does this mean?     Well Sensei already told Hachiman that if you care about someone, you might have to hurt them at times  Given how LN 11 ended, its inevitable that he will hurt either Yukinoshita or Yui if he does end with the a girl.   Anyways, all romance paths go through Yui; its why her character has mostly been romance related (though Yukinoshita has gotten it since Vol 9).    I'm not that confident but I think Yukinoshita wins because Oregairu has shifted to being her story for a few volumes now.    Watari has dumpstered her since the end of Vol 6. Is Yui the one really suffering? Make Yukinoshita happy and strong again Watari             also they have been attacking spyro too all and all, mods needs to do another round in these threads.    Watari hasn't been very nice to Yukino for the past 6 volumes, to say the least. I love her, but even I found her a bit frustrating this episode. It hurts to see her so passive like this.    weird taste, anon.     their songs are good  You can't be serious.    DAIZ YOU FUCKING SLUT I WANTED TO WATCH YAHARI WHEN I WAKE UP   Spyro go to bed    Remember the Ice Queen isn't real, she's just a regular girl that people expect too much from, and she's scared.    Spyro, don't hide your trip.   Reminder that haruno is a stalker    dont know about her family   You're not asian. Asian things wont work like that. Your parent is what matter.     SORE ARU    Ah no, what I meant is that Yui is the only person that Yukino has consistently shielded from her worst impulses, which are to hurt everybody around her.    Oh I'm very confident Yukino will win.         I want 8man to give her a big kiss on the cheek    Who?   Feeling sleep waiting for subs? Have some MAX COFFEE!   holy fuck 6.5 is pure gay shit fuck you watari   Previous post got screwed.  I will miss you all, faggots. Thanks for accompanying me wasting three months here with you all.    Weekly Iroha thread when       Yui is the only person that Yukino has consistently shielded from her worst impulses, which are to hurt everybody around her   Such as?      Koma-COFFEE!  Ka-ching! (^^)        Weekly Iroha thread when  After the BTB train finally stops, I can make them weekly on an agreed day of the week.    How does Watari tweet so fast? New tweet every six seconds?    too bad she didn't learn 8man's bday when she had a chance to do something about it.  Only people who would definitely know who she could get the info from are Komachi and Shizuka.  But she didn't meet Komachi yet and I doubt Shizuka would divulge that info to her so easily.       WHERE THE FUCK ARE MY SUUUBS  I wanna thank all secondaryfags for  Turning the threads into the worst /a/ has ever seen after SnK and Fate combined   Praising a /s4s/ tier spammer   Shittalking spyro and his translation   Being more dense than kodaka and ichika combined  Thank you all       When Yukino tried twice to give Hachiman her homemade chocolate (or was it cookies?), it hurt to watch when she failed. The first time around she wanted to badly but when Yui left, she just froze up and couldnt do it. 2nd time around she just withdrew when Yui gave him her cookies  She's going to give Hachiman the chocolates eventually right?  What happened to her? Beginning of the series she was ice queen but strong willed. Now she's dere but emotionally fragile as fuck \  The thing is she has no faith in her abilities it seems but she can do things, things Yui or Hachiman cannot. 10.5 showed this in the newspaper scene where she actually did a lot of work in finishing the paper (outlining, designing, making a buffer for deadline, all these things Hachiman noted that she could do that he/Yui could not) but Yuki said she couldnt do anything the most.   She just needs more confidence in herself.           This put a smile on my face, even if it didn't mean much.  Thanks FEEL.     no wonder this thread awfully quiet. seems like yuifags already mass suicide    japs love twitter     People at school for one, that's how she got her cold reputation. Her family, as Haruno pointed out early on (that Yukino hates them but doesn't want to be hated herself). 8man on multiple occasions, most recently during the student council election clusterfuck. Hayama and Miura.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127194627  Now that's alpha.    I was asking what did she actually do?    Iroha wasn't in the episode. There wasn't much to shit-talk Yukino either. Not as many people wanted to kick a dog down on it's luck in Yui's case + all her "suffering".      angry Yukinofag, laidies and gentlemen.   What's the best way to get Watari to write a side volume with Yukino sleeping over at the Gahamas? I need this.  Can anyone translate this afterword? It might shed some light on the next volume.   What was yui saying at the end when the music went all dark and shit? Was she bullying Yukino because Yui was able to give her cookies first?   Can anyone translate this  ?    Post a proper pic faggot.    She was about to transform herself into Haruno.    You're getting meme'd. We freaked out for a little bit but the ship was salvaged by 8man himself.  That and I think except for assholes lke that guy and a couple other false-flagshits, both Y-fag ships have hit comfy seas. Service Club is gonna be maximum happiness no matter who wins.       You... don't remember?  She has attempted to sabotage 8man's plans. Later, she basically told him to stop attending club. Until recently, she took every opportunity to insult Miura. Hayama she's been shutting out for years.  You have to know that the details of her family history are vague, but we infer she's put up walls. She's certainly lashed out at Haruno (which isn't to say it was without justification. As for other students at school, use your imagination.         IT WAS ME! HARUNO!   Chances of 11.5 happening is slim right? Seems like it'd be hard to pull off given the main story ended on a cliffhanger   go write some fanfics you cocksucker    Maybe I will. I'll even be sure to mention you in the dedication.   More than half a day later, still nothing.  Someone fucking summon anonsubs right now, I don't give a fuck anymore. Wake him up and tie onto a chair.    Thank you for the good times, anons. What is your favorite anime OP/ED/Insert song?    What it has to do with:   Yui is the only person who up until now has been fully protected by Yukino.      Is there any Japanese iTunes gift card shop online that doesn't charge stupid prices for their codes? I just want to buy the fucking book...    What I was saying is that Yui is the only one who Yukino has never hurt. She's kept her close because she cares for her.     8man salvaging the ship so he can sink it in shallow waters    Read raw scans. If you want to buy, buy kindle version.     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ax4<wbr>4oFrJM58</wbr>  [ ]    If you're talking about the guy that uploaded the .ass files to go with Ohys raws, he can't help. He was able to sub so fast because he just pulled most of the dialog right from Spyro's translations.    Oh, okay. Though  Yukino did shat on Yui once in ep1 s1     Maybe, maybe not. We'll see next volume.    I'm getting the book in a bit, so I don't really care to read the raw scans. I just want to be able to highlight the words and shit and have quick and easy dictionary usage. I'm still just a beginner and can't sightread all the kanji by heart. And the Kindle app on the iTunes store seems to have a lot of bad reviews, is there anything wrong with it?     I can't anymore more wait anymore, beloved anon. Tell our children that I will watch over them in heaven.     At least we still have "someday" wildcard.    We shall memorialize you as the ancestors willed it, with a sticker on the clubroom door.     Yeah that's true, but I think we can call that a special circumstance at this point.    Did anyone fill the complaint to commie already? I'm really displeased with slow progress of their fansubbing         But she is the only character watari seems to put thought on more even than 8man.   Can someone write watari a letter? Does anyone know his e-mail address? I have ponkan-8's email address but I can't mail him for obvious reasons.     Don't worry, anon. They'll finish it up in  November       Gift for you, anon!      Y-you tell em!     Question to novelfags who already read the book volume 11:  1) Is it true that 8man acting like pervert when he is entering Yui's room?Is he really kicked out from her room because it?  2) Is it true 8man is more leaning to Yui than Yukino during their 3p date?  3) What is kind 8man reaction when he received cookies from Yui in novel volume 11?  Sorry for my bias to Yui.           https://twitter.com/herkz2/status/6<wbr>09394136739790850</wbr>       Filing complaint against Commie    I missed the stream, what happened for the finale?  Do they sell these things?   "GO BUY THE (NEXT) LN, FAGGET!" Happened    What do you mean?      Exactly      we're butthurt because people are butthurt at us   Ouroboros. That's the only way to describe it. People throw shit, the other side gets angry and throws shit, it keeps going back and forth.   All the way up to the final episode, sasuga commie. May memesubs live in the people's hearts forever.         Yes.    technically there's another way to describe it: the internet.     happiness no matter who wins    Thanks for the ride, anons. I would seriously miss Yahari thread being made fun of on other threads!   It's been an honor, brothers   Why did Yui force Yukino to choose between love or friendship.   Why did 8man save Yukino's ship?   Why did Yui sunk his own ship?   Tell me /a/ why am I sad when Iam supposed to be happy?       Coming to take you, Irohabros!    Do you need subs?    No yet, my friend Not. Yet.     Yeah, and then Vol.12 is released, the flirtation interpretation of the spoon scene is confirmed and 8man x Iroha becomes a thing. Then 10.000 of them decide to kill everyone else.  Please no.       It was a fun cruise Irohafags; your courage for sticking in your ship even if you guys knew that it would sink is admirable. RIP   IROHA OR DEATH   Anon no don't do it! You have so much to live for!    Why bother bruh?    Then why are you posting pics of fallen warriors? Do you consider yourself out of the battle?     no he doesn't don't lie to him    A voidwalker appears    IROHA AKBAAAAR    The enemy outnumber us a paltry three to one, good odds for any Irohabro    72 Irohasus when we die, brother.    Someone called for me?    That his life's path for having a shitty taste bruh. We have to trample their lives of others to attain the "genuine".   Don't look back; 1 more vol. till the end.     It's 4 AM where are the fucking subs?  Holy shit I hate you Commie     This is why you should have gone to sleep.      1 more vol. till the end.  But the winner is always on the cover of the last volume and Yui just got her cover on Vol11     I already gave up    We will be there.    Could it be you have finally accepted me Anon-kun?        You don't have to die just yet, anons! Have some I lohas!          This kills the ILohas     Your keel may be scraping the sea floor, but your dedication is admirable. May your VN route be long and your wait for a new run of official dakis with all three heroines be short.    been sitting on this uncomfy fucken chair for hours waiting for this shit WHERE ARE MA SOOBS    IT'S NOT THE SAME  IROHA OR DEATH  IROHALLAH AKBAR        You could've used those hours to find an un uncomfortable chair.   In case anyone wanted to watch a play through of the translated VN: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RDb<wbr>8qZdwOrM</wbr>  [ ]  It's Yukino's route and unfinished, so fair warning.       IROHALLAH     You could have bought a Iroha/Yui/Yukino cushion and sat on it.    sitting on your waifu's face isn't nearly as satisfying as having her sit on yours though.   SUBS FUCKING WHEN  Did Yui start liking or noticing 8man after he saved her dog?    coulda shoulda woulda but i thought subs were gonna be out quicker than this. Who the fuck is subbin this shit a blind man with no fingers     Both. Then she fell in love with him after seeing his self-sacrifices and genuine.    No    The ending is not here yet, brother.    Why would you think that? Have you learned nothing over the past 12 weeks?    It came at 10 PM once    it seems it was a slight miscalculation, god dammit i gotta go out in an hour as well so ill have to wait till i get home   Iroha ship sinking?  Since the start, we are not ship, we are sea monster bidding our time to sink yours     She is... perfect... She is truly...perfect...     Irhohabros were born already dead    Slight? I don't think so, friend.     [Commie] Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru.

You should've prepared for a long wait and lots of shitposting.    i was a fool to think otherwise   I guess this is what the entire image was supposed to be without the dialogue in between.   Yes, you were, please learn from these mistakes and never look forward to anything ever again.     friendship ending incoming     Noice     those big Ys   8man's crush's name starts with Y   Wa2 thinks he's trolling the fuck out of me        8man's crush's name starts with Y  That's not Hayama.     Speaking of WA2:  Yui is 8man's classmate      8man's crush name starts with Y  What! when was this!?!    so for how many weeks do you think we're still gonna shit post about this show?  PLEASE   Exactly.     Weeks? I think if we're ambitious we can stretch it out all the way until Vol 12.    Yuimom &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yui   Do you know how many people asked that question while Code Geass R2 was airing?   it's still a thing        yeah that's what I meant and it's late and I'm retarded  i just want suberinos       CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS    l-looking forward to fun things was stupid anyway im gonna go wallow in my despair   Yeah last episode and Commie are late what a fucking surprise.   You will be happier that way. Looking forward to something is always bad and will always lead to disappointment.       watching it after watching LogH   recognizing his voice     COWER, BRIEF MORTALS  I SEEK THE IROHAFAGS  A LONG WALK AWAITS US.      dank memes where   Wakamoto is the KING. Best voice EVER.   He's also Vicious, Mechazawa, and Chiyo's dad. And a ton of other stuff I can't remember off the top of my head.      All red   Try tomorrow  :^)        This episode was painful to watch, with Yukino going full dependance mode and Yui going Minori mode. Good thing 8man stopped them and prevented Yui from autosinking   My proposal is Iroha's Sly Saturday    sink   We don't sink, we dive. Our ship-submarine allows us to get pass the AT.Field. When they release 10.5 date OVA and vol. 12, we will surface again          How do you guys think Commie creates their dank memes?   It will be a long journey on this ship now.   I'm starting to get tired.   Just sleep, anon.    They manufacter it in reddit/anime/   This is it, anon. This is goodbye. Even if I had final exam, even if I had college entrance exam, I still wasted my time here shitposting. I won't forget this thirteen weeks I wasted with you   They probably wont even be up by the time you wake up. Fuck off and go to bed.   Thanks for nothing, Commie Danksubs.  Irohasu!    alright, good night friends.    did iroha win the animebowl?   Who?    Z E R O screentime in this episode.  Down to the sea ocean with you.     Yui wont suffer.  Y U I U I      iroha btfo   you're waifu a shit     The anime's ended already.  Why are these threads still here? Just to suffer?     complaining about the speed of fansubbing   Am I the only one who can see 8man rejecting both Yui and Yukino (if she even likes him that way, as some argue)? I mean, it's not necessary that he actually loves one of them, right?   Most of the Anons here haven't seen the episode yet.    Because you bumped it, Faggot!     Iroha Sly Saturday   That's catchy as fuck      took me awhile to realize what this was    No  Go ask Hiratsuka sensei!       Iroha's Sly Saturday  That could work.     Delusional lonerendfag  He loves Yukino, that much is obvious.       8man   being in love at this point  You need a mirror to look at.      No, I'm not delusional nor do I think so because of some ship. I think Yui has better chances than Yukino, but even then it doesn't really mean that 8man is going to start dating her.    He's shown more interest in Iroha.    He has feelings for her yeah, but I'm not sure if we can really say he's in love with her.    Really? When has he tried to actually get to know her? I want to see what 8man thinks in that situation.     Volume 11 suggests Yui knows 8man and Yukino had feelings for each other.     Iroha's Sly Saturday  I like it     It was my impression too.     Yukino (if she even likes him that way, as some argue)  She gave him some homemade cookies in the club room but wanted to give him this before they parted ways, only for her to freeze up when Yui was going to leave them alone.     No faggot, Saika is his favorite    That's just her thinking, but it doesn't mean it's true. Every POV should be taken with the grain of salt, especially 8man's.   I'm not lonerendfag, nor do I opposue the idea that 8man likes one of them, I just feel that there's the option of 8man accepting their confessions, but not actually dating.       wants to give him v-day choco   can't do it without her best friend around   her best friend loves him and she probably knows it   Just how in the world can you like a bitch like that? All of this eventually led to Yui being forced to do what she did.         This is no joke true. The only reason he doesnt devote his life to Saika is because he knows hes a boy.    Okay   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127198982  Thats kind of the point.    Look at this fucking face, just look at it. The face of a useless pet.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127198982  forgot pic, disregard       I wonder how it will be in the VN. Will Hayama become a second hand for the double-YY which doesn't get picked?    Quotes    So is commie spending hours deciding on the proper memes?   Man, this autistic girl makes the weirdest faces.    Yukino made cookies for me    Hachiman isn't the only person she's relying on, also it's probable that she wasn't aware of Yui's feelings or if she was she didn't want to believe it was true.    v-day   3p date   it's snowing   go to an aquarium   are fake as fuck the entire time   Good job guys! Those definetely aren't death flags!         no they're just slow     she barely understands her own feelings you think she's gonna pick up on Yui's crush. It's not like Yui tries sucking him off in front of her     It's actually the day after v-day.   are fake as fuck the entire time  Just wait until you see it.      What the fuck is this shit. I didn't sleep, I am hungry, my eyes hurt and Irohafags still exist. Fuck you watari, fuck you and yourself     A more important question.   How would a Haruno route work?       I think that too   Holyshit, this place is just like 5 minutes with bus from where I live in. This also the station where I ride the train when I'm going to Comiket    Become the edgy 8man and refuse to change no matter what happens.    wow nice blog mate, tell us more please     This. Yukino has never been an Ice Queen Bitch, that was her way of pushing people away from her.     Iroha isn't a fragile girl, she know what she wants and she'll take it, no matter what! We need to believe brothers!    Yeah, also just one station away from Disneyland XD   Wait so Saki not only has Taishi and Keika but another even younger brother too?   Sakimom is literally pounded every night.    Copied from another site: "Quick hint: the reason Yukino's supposed 180 degrees character turn around seems so strange, is because you are under the assumption that her Ice Queen Bitch persona is her actual personality. It isn't.  Her character development isn't so much: Cold Ice Queen Bitch -&gt; Insecure Fragile Emo girl.  If anything it's: Insecure Fragile Loner Girl with too high ideals of what the world should be like, who doesn't get any emotional support at home yet has to live up to her "perfect" sister's image, but because she can't, gets treated like she's some kind of disappointment by her mother (possibly father as well), who gets bullied at school by girls in her class because of how "perfect" she is and because she gets to hang out with one of the best looking, most popular boys in class (who those girls probably assume she's dating), now she's forced to create a different harsher personality for herself as a front to keep bullies at bay, also that same boy who she assumed was her "friend", when given the chance to stand up for her, chooses to preserve his social status over sticking up for her, which pretty much means that throughout her entire youth this character has had no one she could truly trust or be herself around with, unless you count Haruno or her female friends that eventually end up being jealous of her and ultimately betray her. -&gt; Hey, I've actually found two people that I can trust, open myself up to and be myself around with, however due to an incident a year ago we're off to a rough start, but that's okay, we got through it, but wait now one of my friends has developed a martyr complex because he thinks that our friendship can only last as long as we're in the same club, he's willing to self-sacrifice his social status/hurt himself to keep the club intact, I've tried stopping him, but he's willing to lie, use underhanded tactics and go behind my back all for the sake of preserving the club instead of our friendship,           HOT THREESOME END  If we send our worshipful prayers of fapping, it'll become true!        now (as much as I don't want to) I have to tell him to stop coming to the club because he's literally forcing himself to be here also this (and him constantly having to sacrifice himself) is only making him miserable, however the next day he shows up unannounced and asks if we can help him with the request he’s been previously trying to keep us away from, he says that it’s all his fault, which means that once again he’s taking all the guilt and blame on himself and he’s telling us that we shouldn’t feel any sense of guilt or responsibility about any of the mistakes we’ve collectively made up until this point, however him blaming himself entirely and being miserable was the reason why I didn’t want him to force himself to come back to the club in the first place, which is why I tell him that if he truly believes that it’s all his fault, that he should solve it on his own, however he then starts to give a speech, he goes silent for a few seconds, starts crying and exclaims that he wants something GENUINE! wait, what? … what does he mean by this? because of my past insecurities, trust issues and being pretty much an emotional coward (something you would have noticed if you had been paying attention to how every single time an emotionally sensitive topic is brought up I either avert my gaze, clench my fists, turn my back, leave the classroom, say my piece but then quickly leave before I let the other party say what’s on their mind (end of S2E7) because if I had to listen to their response my Cold Ice Queen Bitch exterior would break, even in positive scenarios like near the end of S2E9 where I tell my friend: “Here’s to another year together”, I can only muster up the courage to say this, because the doors are about to close and the train is about to take off)     she wasn't aware of Yui's feelings  During the three person date she knew damn well that Yui loves him. Maybe Yui said something the previous night.   if she was she didn't want to believe it   Denial is possible but I don't evidence for it. She was just so much in a panic she probably wasn't thinking.       Where can I order the new book please?   and because I haven’t really been honest to my friends about the car accident, when I hear that he wants something genuine, I don’t know how to react to this, I don’t know what it is he’s asking from me, I decide to immediately leave the classroom because I don’t want them to see me in a vulnerable state, however after regaining my composure I tell him that I’ll accept his request of giving him something genuine (whatever that may mean) and I decide to be more open, honest and friendly towards my friends, also to lower my defenses and to show them who I really am."     It went as I predicted, that Yui would do something that would take her out of the running, and then 8man bats it aside with his dick.    Yfw fansubbing is dead    Correction, It was similar to my prediction.     Prediction for volume 12?     Yui thought this was going to happen, right or not, she thinks they are romantically interested in each other.      tfw she parrots 8man, word for word  well, i think i understand now. yukino is seriously damaged goods.  if 8man wants to try to fix her, that's fine. but don't stick your dick in crazy.       Next chapter when?    They confess, 8man rejects both of them     Why aren't you posting spoilers faggot? Do it! DO IT NOW!     Yes, there are plenty of hints in Volume 11 which leave think 8man has feelings for Yukino and Yui saw that.    Knowing != understanding  Yukino knew what's up but didn't fully understand what's going on. Until Yui's confession.      I think that too.    Wake up   Still no memesubs  Fucking commie.  Also Fire Emblem is fucking shit.       We'll see Iroha again?     In descending order of likely-hood.  Instead of a friendship end, it'll be a get together after graduation end, where one of the girls is vaguely implied to go out with him to the frustration of all the readers.  Yui/Yukino are equally likely.  Threesome end and Iroha end.   Service Club is turned into the Fanservice Club and everyone acts like swingers, Iroha enjoys living in sin with 8man along with the rest of the girls, but gets a fat greasy cock from the fat nerd that hangs around 8man every now and then. Komachi rapes Saika while 8man watches intensely.              Go back to sleep, subs on Saturday.   Where can I order the new book please?  I want to marry Yukino.  So let's get this straight: Yui and Yukino both know the other one is in love with 8man. 8man told them not to be superficial and both want to give him something genuine. What does this mean?   Amazon.   He wants something real, if they fake their feelings just so no one gets hurt they would be going against what they're trying to find.       Of course, she'll come to the service club to ask for help for the 3rd year graduation speech    8man wants Yui to confess to him, so he can reject her. After they've gotten that out of the way, then can genuinely become friends. Hachiman has been aware of Yui's feelings for him for quite some time now, however he's been trying to prevent her from confessing to him, in order to not hurt her feelings (fireworks festival, season 2 episode 12 where he pulled a Hayato by coming up with the chocolate tasting solution so he wouldn't have to deal with a direct confession), but after Sensei told him that sometimes you have to hurt people you care about and especially after Haruno kicked their butts last episode, he's now fully prepared to be honest with Yui.     Oh shit.    Rejections and more rejections. All 3 main girls will make their moves, but 8man is simply not ready for romance yet. Bittersweet friendship ending with everyone still meeting at the club.      Double trips confirm.    That's like a 10% chance of happening. We thought that ships were going to sink this volume.    She wins the 8bowl    He loves Yukino by head and loves Yui by heart.    But going forward if they are open with their feelings then it will completely change the atmosphere. Maybe they won't deny they exist but not drag it into the open all the time. At least one of them will get hurt.    You must've missed the thread where a few moonfags broke down his dialogue and thoughts and her dialogue on that spoon scene. Overall conclusion is that he took a step foward in wanting to get personal with her, but that only happened because we had to take the entire scene in context.    All moon speak aside can someone give me a quick summary on the latest release? Iroha's still winning... right?     All 3 main girl     Watari has a long period of writer's block and gives up on completing the story.    Sorry, Saki and Miura are out.    Implying it is not Yamaha     Iroha's still winning... right?   Volume 10: irrelevant Volume 11: irrelevant       see     Hey man, it takes time to cram memes into every possible sentence. Quality takes time.     Yes, she is the only choice, the other two girls are just being annoying with their drama.     Dat anagram   Oh shiiiieeet!!       he took a step foward in wanting to get personal with her  He said he doesn't hate her acting sweet or her chocolate. Once she's gone he says to himself it was too sweet.  I'll wait for a full translation to make sense of it.       I was hoping that Yukino would pull herself together after the stuco arc, now I think Haruno would be better.     TL-Iroha-fag  I bet your translation on that bullshit choco part is totally not biased. Face it, she's irrelevant.     What was up with the penguins? I know the sign said that they only have one partner in their life. Why did that make Yui and Yukino sad?  Next volume is going to be exclusively Yukino and there's nothing you can do about it.   Neutron star vs nandatte    Yui because she knows she's the third wheel  Yukino because she's a chicken     We've gone through this debate already, check the archives.     I'll wait for a full translation to make sense of it.   Implying you wouldn't start giving your own interpretations of the english transtrated text with stupid english dictionary quotes to support your argument that he rejected her      Yukino left them alone because she knows Yui has feelings for him probably thinking Yui was going to do something. Yui probably wanted to say something but couldn't work up the courage.      I'll wait for a full translation to make sense of it.  5 bucks on Spyro taking the bad side of the debate, essentialy doing a 'suki...nano' again.  But it's not his fault though and he won't be necessarily wrong, Watari wrote that in a purposely ambiguous way.       That's like the complete opposite. Yui's been trying to avoid being alone with Hachiman the whole time. She's even trying to leave so Yukino can give her chocolates to Hachiman, but Yukino needs her around to babysit her.     That false image tacked onto her just so normies would have a reason to hate her   No wonder she keeps dropping by like someone to babysit her when things might go wrong.       And you seriously notice this just now?    It's already 3:30 where are the dank commie memes?   Iroha can get BTFO by Haruno any day    Go to sleep, anon.    5 bucks on Spyro taking the bad side of the debate and EOPs spamming "See? Spyro said he rejected her"    88  8man speaking his mind        6:30 here. No sleep, only Fire Emblem bullshit.    It doesn't matter what side of the translation he's going to take, it's going to open the flood gates to waifu war shitposting.  I have a feeling that the Irohafags are going to get the short end of the stick in this one.      They were sad because it reminded them there can only be one. You see, they both like the same guy and they both know one of them isn't going to be picked. Fortunately for them 8man may reject both, they would probably less heart broken that way because it would be very painful for their friend to get him.    Why is the Arena so GOAT?  It kills you when it deems you unworthy       and EOPs spamming "See? Spyro said he rejected her"  That's a given. Yukinofags already hate Irohafags with a passion and that will just make things worse.     Iroha fans still clinging   Iroha already knows her fate from vol10.5   Iroha taking a photo for the three on 8man's phone    “Okay, we’ll go with this,” Isshiki said, winking and promptly readied the phone. This might’ve been Isshiki’s consideration as well. Honestly, I don’t get her at all…    “Here you go, senpai… It’s a good picture,” Isshiki said, wearing a slightly mature smile. I didn’t bother trying to ask what she meant since I was sure she meant exactly what she said.   Don't make this any more harder for her.            no commie subs = slow threads = comfy threads    Is it bad that I like the sloppy turds that CR give out? At least they come out on time.   I feel that people who are too far up their asses saying, "but my subtle nuances, my preciously hand crafted translation made from pure 100% weeaboo hands", need to chill out and just realize that it's not the end of the world.  And if you're going to complain about CR shit and lick the shoes of people who translate the material themselves, why the fuck don't you just learn Japanese and jack off to your superiority?  It's a bad case of a little brother putting on a leather jacket and combat boots because he wants to impress his older brother, the chain smoking delinquent that went to juvenile hall.           I'm liking it m'anon.     5 bucks on Spyro taking the bad side of the debate and EOPs spamming "See? Spyro said he rejected her"   Who cares? 8man doesn't give a single fuck of Iroha.      Fine,maybe they just don't give a shit, because her dad isn't a REAL bigshot like a cabinet minister or a representative in the National Diet, he's just a municipal councilor on a committee that manages a single city and he has a big pile of money (probably yakuza bribes or something)   Did Haruno rape 8man already?   She was just being considerate, because it was about Service Club and she is not a part of it. Her attitude is back to normal in vol.11     yfw spyro is a yuifag     if you complain about our product, why don't you make it yourself?   That's a poor argument, Anon. If no one complain, how are they gonna improve their translation? If no one complain how would they know there is something wrong in their work? If no one complain, they would think it's fine to slap half-assed works since no one really mind anyway.        If no one complain, how are they gonna improve their translation?   You're so pure, I'd marry you, anon. Do you really think people give a rat's ass about other complaint's?  Do you think they have weekly meeting where they discuss group synergy and task efficiency? I love you anon, but you're too naive.           misunderstanding with 8man   She's not just being considerate. She knows 8man already has the two. She purposely presented to use his phone.   This way, 8man will have a photo of the two in his own phone. That's why she winked at him.        So where's the Yukinon kotobukiya scale? Someone said it was going to happen.   I agree it's a poor argument. Everyone can receive constructive criticism. But shitting on someone out of pure spite isn't nice.    That scene made me like her even more. And honestly, the picture of 3 of them together just strengthens the friendship end   How does Haruno have enough time to stir up and observe teenage drama?   She doesn't appear that often.    Comfy thread = Meguri thread    It's a part of her social research and her dissertation.   Brothers?    This. It's not like she's around every single day. Keep in mind that during and in between episodes, there are time skips.     College student. They have too much freetime.  And I bet she can't go to college parties because of her status and spends her time fingering herself while screaming HIKIGAYA OMOSHIROI      Brother!     And I bet she can't go to college parties because of her status and spends her time fingering herself while screaming HIKIGAYA OMOSHIROI  With the same finger she uses to poke 8mans cheeks, because it has his DNA    Is Saber a virgin?  no  No, she had Mordred.  No, she's not.  Rin and Rider are, though.     no she even had once a dick   She's a fictional character who was a virgin at one point and not a virgin at another point.   Wasn't Rider raped during her life?    dicks can be virgins   Rin is the only virgin heroine.   A+ writing.    Do you think Nasu has ever had sex?    I doubt Nasu even interacts with females much by the way he writes.   Post an anime that you think gets too much hate on /a/.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=TTm<wbr>zILP4wZM</wbr>  [ ]     filler  not an adaptation      kek  Fuck off.      This. I don't remember anyone really hating Space Dandy and I practically live here.      SAO is bad (writing-wise) in a passively offensive sort of way that apparently not everyone can pick up on. This is why some people have zero issues with it while some absolutely can't stand it.    Hey there. Dumping a dead scanlation. Chapters are usually 8 pages long. The raws look terrible, so I'd be willing to scan this, if anyone wants to work on it.  Previous works include Genocyber. Tony Takezaki's Evangelion parody anthology was recently published by Dark Horse. Aside from that, he also has a comedic Gundam anthology that's a few volumes long.   The hero is Dr. Kishiwada, a brilliant but demented scientist, who creates bizarre mechas, battles the forces of evil, or just mucks about. There are many parodies of B-grade sci-fi movies and of TV. Crazy, slick, and very funny.                     Japanese clocks  It's the fucking international standard everywhere in the world except for contrarian America.     No way that is real.     I guess this just confirms the theory that 4kids can't show excessive merchandizing in a show based off merchandise.      A M E R I F A T M E R I F A T             "My bike…"  Would've been fucking amazing.    New Famitsu scans of Steins;Gate 0. 30% done.
