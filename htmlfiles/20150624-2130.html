[ Buyfag thread, read this before asking questions http://buyfag.moe  rerelease   Cupoche look disgusting. Like nebdoroids sister with downs.   tfw want to buy kancolle figs but people keep calling me a filthy secondary    Cupoche look disgusting  Opinions     Cupoche look all right. Like Nendoroids with joints.    What the hell kind of rifle is that?     Giving a shit about what others plebs could think about the shit you buy  Step up nigga     It's better than the usual opinion. He gave a valid criticism. He doesn't like the faces.   Most retards come in here and just blurt out random franchise hate, "kek SAO autist"       Cupoche are the pochaco of nendoroids. They look disgusting and they are not ok as op.      Cupoche look disgusting  You misstyped Nanorich, anon     I don't find her that nice for some reason   how the hell do you pronounce cupoche again?   It's the best Tenshi and it was baby's first love tragedy for college aged teens who are too young to realize it's nothing special.    kyu poesh-.    Their faces are ugly. There is something very off about them. Especially the mouth. And they all have the same copypasted open mouth in every character. I like that the got joints but I wish they would learn how to make cute faces. But have to say, if they make yugioh characters I would buy them anyway.      But have to say, if they make yugioh characters I would buy them anyway.  You are in luck, there is a Dark Magician Girl in the line     Sadly the only one. I meant more like yugi or any of the other "main characters", I would also give a lot for arc v characters. Or dark magician to go with dark magician girl.   Nippon-Yasan's asking for a picture of my credit card with my name on it, but I only used a debit card that doesn't have my name on it. Payment pushed through, however. Anyone else had this problem before?   I remember someone in this thread being asked for a picture of his passport.    Other characters from YuGi-OH woould be great TBH   How do you guys feel about this?   I like it   How is Pulchra?    Mouth and chin ruin it for me. Shame too, because I really, really like it otherwise.     The ahoge is stupid.    The other version is this. I find the first more appealing. I am thinking about it but the baby face looks off. I still think it looks great.    I actually like it a bit. Just the baby chin is getting to me and I'm not sure if that's enough to stop me.   Is she cast off? If I ever see this one on sale I might get her.   It looks good but I dont see the appeal of busts or other figures where part of the body is missing, like lower legs.    The welded tits are bothersome though. I don't think so though. Semen demon isn't either.    I don't have only figures so it isn't out of place for me. Also the sculptor put a lot of detail in and if he included the rest of it then it would be either, really expensive, or not that great.    APS Underwater Rifle, it shoots big darts.  Step up your obscure gun knowledge anon.       phat will never re-release Mio or Ranko  P-Please.     Yeah the little weld and visible seams aren't great, hence why I would wait for a sale. I think the face looks pretty damn good, and the rest is okay. Not fond of the Maria fig, face is bad. And I just prefer Mio.   Can amiami banned you if you missed payment for once? I already cancel an item last month and I don't want ask them again. This figure quality looks ugly as fuck   They can and might, but I've cancelled many orders and ignored payment twice before and I'm still not banned.    I asked for cancellation 5 times didn't pay 3 times used my total cancel then I can't cancel anymore.       Next time use HLJ to save all this trouble. I usually use Amiami, but for items I'm not 100% sure of I go with HLJ.   I live in Canada and I plan on ordering something from AmiAmi.  The buyfag guide mentions something about Pornogaphy and Lolis, does this prevent me from order anything loli-like or only if that specific loli is subjected/related to 18+ stuff?      Fuck it I'll just not pay, rather spend my money on something useful. Plus I'm leaving for vacation this late month. I'll keep that in mind, mainly use amiami as well.      I like loli, but I wouldn't recommend it because it pays with consequences if customs happen to open your parcel. Just get stuff with adult looking woman and you'll be fine.    I've missed payment for 2 months in a row, and I'm not banned.    Why did you even preorder her? Only po where you know it will be good     something useful  Like what? Another prostitute?     but what is classified as loli? I want to pick up a PriPara nendoroid, is that not even safe?    Wow, aside from the giant eyes, she actually looks Japanese.    You're retarded.    Of course that's safe. Just don't purchase any lewd loli products. Actual pornogarphy or statues with nudity etc    Nigger use your brain. How is a nendoroid even sexual? Don't get lewds and you'll be fine.    I almost got her too but &gt;welded tits    What are you planning to do with that nendo that you even think its lewd?    Not sure I just thought it was gonna be decent, but I also browse other daiki kogyo figures and they look like shit too   Food, clothing      Looking worse and worse and getting more expensive.  This is outrageous.     If these were priced like figmas they might actually be okay, but fuck the prices are outrageous for the quality and just in general.   I'm almost tempted just because it's Haruna though.        but I've cancelled many orders and ignored payment twice before and I'm still not banned.  Man, fuck you. I've asked to cancel something once in 4 years of buyfagging (a tentative pre-order with an unknown release date, at that) and they politely told me to fuck off.    Apparently I heard in the original version of Spopovich vs Videl, Spopovich kicks her teeth out or something. I noticed a lot of dubs have this fight edited but I wanna find the original.  Where do I find the original animefriends?      a lot of dubs  Like this one?     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=J8p<wbr>sgbpFR3I</wbr>  [ ] none of the teeth actually fall out, but her mouth and nose bleed after getting a couple knees to the face     cheers anon    I felt so bad for Videl watching this fight.  She had just started to get strong and her first opponent ended up being the guy who can't really die.      And thus she was reduced to a shitty useless side character since      Kill yourselves. Sage and report.       go and read the manga?    Fucking this.    Wow,Goku,what a dick.   did vegeta actually pull out semi-perfect cell's innards when he gave him that first punch in the jap version?  cause you see vegeta do a pulling motion after that punch and then cell clumsily moonwalks back.  looks weird as shit.      This little fucking shit stain faggot holy shit.  I'm just a quarter of the show in and everything this goddamn prick does is to fuck everything up and either act smug or pretend like its not a big deal by doing jack shit about it.  I watch Chinese Cartoons to ease up and relax after a stressful week of dealing with irrevocable shitheads like him only to find out that the show stars the same kind of irrevocable shitheads.  Please tell me he gets fired or at least becomes less of a piece of shit   Ema is best girl.           He dies  how can you hate the best character  He's actually competent at what he does and he made the biggest cunt of the show into his bro.  Meanwhile in /a/cademy city   Don't run.   Just let it happen.          I have this classmate she's level 5 and is very good at sports, I think I've fallen for her. How can I get myself to date her?     I'm a level 0 btw       Saten, get the fuck off the internet. If Kuroko finds out about this then you're fucked.  Also stop using the Judgment wi-fi. You're slowing down my torrents.      Ugh, stop arguing or I'll short out your devices.    Life here is kind of rough when your a stage magician. I mean you got children who can do incredible things with there ability. All I can do is separate two rings that are connected to each other  Previously on Academy City....  Accelerator began to bang Last Order. But could do it since she kept say "Misaka Misaka hurts. Misaka Misaka hurts!" Then the darkness of a alleyway, Kamijo tries to stick it into Mikoto Misaka but can't get get it hard due to touching it with his Imagine Breaker. Kuroko rushes in from the dark to strike him down with a trash can.      Man. How long has it been since any update on that anime?   I swear its been like years, if I remember anything past the miserable collection of other moeblob ecchi shit I've had to repress in my head.  Are the producers just not caring anymore?        Stop posting your bullshit online, there will be hell to pay if they see this.    Sauce?    How do you call "controlling water with your mind"?  I need a dude like that to paint my room.      Literally any telekinetic worth shit can control stuff like water, I wouldnt use it to paint a room though, it basically never comes out even    well, i have this unlucky high school level 0 friend but somehow alot of girls seem attracted to him.  I heard he has alot of real magician friends. you should ask him      Real Magicians     Has anyone tried to poison this faggot yet?    You'd have to go around poisoning the coffee in every vending machine, there'd be too much collateral damage. (I'm pretty sure he has never been mentioned eating in the novels, only ever drinking canned coffee)    Telekinesis = Moving with mind Hydrokinesis = Moving water with mind    So...does anyone know where I can find a link to that level upper or... Google isn't giving me any results.   Raid the Windowless building with me.  Some middleschool cunt shorted out my new PFP.  Fucking high levels I swear. You think I can get a refund?   Woke up and found a bunch of stickers with weird letters stuck on the walls outside my apartment. It wasn't Japanese either.   Not just my room too, everyone on my floor had the same thing.

We all know that Moot hasn't left us and is just hiding inside that damn building.       Yeah? And I'm Misaka Mikoto, AMA.    who?   Just yesterday, in Seventh Mist, I saw a blond-haired man getting chased by a girl in a tracksuit. Is Academy City this strange?  I was hanging out at a cafe the other day in District 7 when suddenly this fag shows up and starts attacking this girl with a flower headband. He kicked her and dislocated her shoulder and was about to curb stomp her when another guy with white hair showed up by throwing an ATM at her before I got out of there.  How often does this shit happen in D7? I wanted to help her but I'm just a level 1 and my power sucks.   Flower girl if you are reading this I'm sorry that I couldn't do anything       The Roman Catholic Church did nothing wrong. Except Biagio. Biagio did everything wrong.

His glasses fell off, silly.     glasses break last chapter   implying Oda won't reveal what his eyes look like next chapter     Doffy doesn't have eyes, he uses observation haki to see    It's not. It's the girl.     That'd be neat but I doubt it. He probably has plain, normal eyes. We know his right one is normal at the very least. Now the left one might be damaged somehow but we can't be sure.    His left eye is  a flamingo!    Doflamingo's glasses were actually a device to suppress his haki.   Calling it, his eyes won't be revealed yet, but Oda will tease us.    banned    no sweater tag   Why     Just go to gelbooru or something    Here anon, have some sweaters http://g.e-hentai.org/g/453746/9eb6<wbr>a85b45?p=0 http://g.e-hentai.org/g/465808/d222<wbr>c1b880?p=0</wbr> </wbr>    Sadpanda thread?

New Chapter soon  Pastebin: http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87      If there's one voice I absolutely hate in ASB, it's Kaji Yuuki as Johnny      Fuck off with this no fun shit.     The Pucci change is because David cast ASB Pucci's voice actor as Vanilla Ice (likely due to said actor voicing Vanilla in HftF). There's no one I want David to keep more than Jolyne's voice actor. I will never be able to settle for anything less.     I wish they hadn't done that. Vanilla isn't a demanding role and he's nowhere near as important as Pucci.    I doubt David was thinking about part 6 at the time. Even if they do end up doing it, it's still a long way away.   1 page thread   I read that too.

Thinly veiled Gate thread      Aren't sucking off water from the oceans their main objective?   Daily reminder that if the cheesy nationalism is cut back for the show, it will be unwatchable garbage because ultimately the cheesy nationalism was the only thing that made it interesting. Personally, I hope they go full Nippon strongu.   THing I remember is that some dirty alien bastards tried to take humans on and that the thing that would happen is that if you're, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, doesn't matter, white/yellow/black/red or brown it's of not point not when some bunch of alien arseholes turn up. Humanity is very, very vicious and could surprise the fuck out of aliens or dimensional worlds/Parallel Worlds. Anyhow that's my thoughts      the cheesy nationalism was the only thing that made it interesting  that's bullshit. the whole modern day vs fantasy clash is interesting enough. and of course Rory is a god-tier character; figuratively &amp; literally.     Hei is now the protagonist of gate   what changes    Is this a horse?   Just because she was waiting for them doesn't mean he didn't mean them though.    Are you saying he's a shallow cunt and not genuine?    It depends on the terms of their contract. But most likely the 12 volumes contract is an exclusivity clause and after that, he's free to change publisher unless they agree on a contract extension    He wants to just be nice to her.
