[ ITT : Shows that made you fucking mad<br><br>Mine is Sakura Trick. Shameless dykes kissing each other with dumb as fuck forced drama. Absolutely disgusting show, never was this mad while watching an anime.</br></br>  Sakura Trick is the worst anime I've feverishly enjoyed.  This is the sixth time you have made a thread about it.  <br>I hated every moment but I suffered through it, convinced that it would eventually pay out with emotional catharsis and actual cuteness<br><br>It did not. It made all the right plays and failed to deliver with any of them.</br></br></br>  <br>This. Looking back I hate the show, but I had fun watching it.</br>  Nigga this show is like 2 years old. Why do peope complain about it? Was it seriously THAT bad?  This triggers the Troid.  <br>He is becoming increasingly efficient at it.</br>  How can you hate the show that gave us lesbian physics? <br><br>Somebody post that webm, please.</br></br>  <br>It was bad I guess objectively, when it first aired I rewatched each episode on and off every week but I haven't really watched it since. It was hella fun to watch with /a/ though, especially the first episode stream which was one of the funnest /a/ memories for me. Chat and the thread blew up like every 4 seconds, especially during the OP. Great times, back then before hating yuri became an epic meme.</br>  <br>There was definitely already a yuri backlash before Sakura Trick. Long before actually. I think it started around summer 2012.</br>  I loved every second of it    Also, physics  <br>No, something is deeply wrong with OP and he's going to die alone and unloved, wondering how he could have fucked up so bad.</br>  <br>I hated Code Geass. I had a lot of trouble just stomaching it.<br><br>I hated it because of Lelouch, but I couldn't just tough it out so I could see his death scene; I have never been a person that gets any sense of catharsis from character death, regardless of what I think of the character.</br></br></br>  <br>The show was bad. Shoved yuri and disgusting kissing scene into the viewer's throat. Fuck this show.</br>  <br> disliking a show about qt gay girls making out <br>i bet you spend your time watching moe shit anyway. how could anyone dislike this show?</br></br>  <br>How does an anime make you literally mad? Can't you find humor in anything, or were you being forced to watch it? <br><br>You spergs man, sometimes I just don't fucking get it.</br></br></br>  <br> disgusting kissing </br>  <br>but it was a yuri show</br>  <br>It needed less drama and more comedy</br>  "IT" has a horse pussy. Very disgusting.<br><br><br>Even more disgusting than horse is bird.<br><br>Birds shits, pee and lay eggs from the same hole. Ultra disgusting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I pity you.</br>  Jesus Christ there are already two monmusu threads up. What the fuck are you even doing  <br>Technically a cloaca would be like anal.<br><br>Snakes also have a cloaca, as would a fish. <br>Slimes would be just stick it in wherever because it is all the same consistency or could at least become so.<br>Spiders have a kind of vagina-like structure called an epigyne, but it looks like pic related and sperm gets there by hand</br></br></br></br></br>   not liking best girl <br><br>I wanna brush her rump</br></br>  <br>i do like her but she wont be here until next week.</br>  <br> those little fish limbs </br>  Does she have two pussies?<br>She's covering the front bottom.</br>  <br>no she just does.</br>  <br>  those creepy little fish arms <br>Why?</br></br>    <br> those little fish limbs <br><br>Cute as hell.</br></br></br>  <br><br>she needs them for stuff</br></br>  Drawfag Thread 1551<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1539:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn<br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1550 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Request clothes-bursting, ahegao-inducing transformation into succubus or lilim.<br><br>http://monstergirlencyclopedia.wiki<wbr>a.com/wiki/Succubus<br>http://monstergirlencyclopedia.wiki<wbr>a.com/wiki/Lilim<br><br>Some known transformation methods:<br>- She gets herself off, setting off the demonic energy accumulated in her body from visiting monster lands as part of her work<br>- An existing succubus or lilim does something lewd to her.<br>- Bath in a demonic hot spring.</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  Requesting Crab doing Monkey doggy style, either with a strapon or futa dick, up to artist, with Monkey looking extremely happy and Crab having a very apathetic look on her face except maybe some slight redness.

I have no real quarrel but I just wish he was less fickle with drawing.  I miss BB and others who used to come here to draw, thanks a lot shitposters. </br>  <br>How is he supposed to trace and have proportion issues at the same time?</br>  Something cute involving these two like a sleep over with one of these projection night lights would be great please and thank you.  <br>you'd be surprised what an idiot can do.</br>    <br>Is there a difference between taticool, tacticute, and operator anime girls?</br>  <br>Well tacticool and tacticute should be obvious. <br>I think operator covers both but leans towards tacticool.</br></br>  <br>If you reference different fanworks for different body parts then splice them together without understanding anatomy it's pretty easy.</br>  requesting Tamamo from FateExtra in this<br>also more underboob art</br>  Requesting a kiss between these two, leading to a comedic acid burning of the boy's mouth.

I hope you like chromatic aberration..</br></br></br>  <br>fyi this is over 50% lewd by a decent margin, if you do not see the issue then you're an idiot.<br>there are boards with threads dedicated to these precise requests, go there.<br>if you want to draw them, go to those threads.<br>if you want to request them, request them there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>there'd be the issue of /h/ being more populated than /a/, and the general behavioral attitudes that accompany a board with less restriction. Nah, really that's a very conjecture idea and no one still gives a shit.</br>  <br>Well if you avoid doing lewd request usually why post it when it's fucking saturated with them?</br>  Requesting these two fucking like http://imgur.com/a/YWsZE or http://drawfriends.booru.org/index.<wbr>php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=31057 or or something competitive like mud wrestling; alternatively this with any of the other goddesses and their counterparts (ie Vert, Blanc)</wbr>  <br>the 2 I missed were both lewd, which is not helping your case.<br><br>because you don't go there.<br>go there instead of here to request your stupid shit and this wouldn't be an issue.<br>you're confusing YOU with no one.<br>YOU are an idiot with a behavior problem in general that doesn't belong on /a/ and have been called out on it before.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you for drawing my waifu a few months back</br>  <br>Thanks for the reply and potential work, Anon, I'm fine with chromatic aberration, so long as it's not excessive...<br><br>As for using a name, I'd recommend avoiding it unless you're replying to a request, posting a piece, or etc<br>I'm sure you know but wearing it all the time would just cause more problems for yourself... if it's relating to your works or an identity (OP / OR) it's helpful though.<br><br>I do enjoy having a name to an artist too, as I name works with [SFW/NSFW][character][series][artis<wbr>t] personally and it makes finding them easier.<br><br><br><br>Because I didn't check the requests prior to posting. I realised after posting that it was saturated as such.<br>I actually deleted my request at that point, but later remade it as a "why should I" moment.<br><br>I was then considering deleting it again, I'm sorry if I caused any problems...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Eve and Yami with large breasts, sex or paizuri!</br>  <br>I've only ever made a single request in these threads, it was a WWD over a month ago and it was anonymous. But everything else I have no qualms.</br>  <br>minor fixes</br>  <br>Except plenty of people give a shit, this is a divided issue. What's wrong with the /h/ drawthread being more populated than the /a/ one? It's about quality of posts, not quantity.</br>  I would fulfill a request if you people could request anything other than lewd stuff. It's not that I mind drawing ecchi things, but when that's 95% of the requests a guy gets sick of it, you know?  While learning, should I draw full humans or just draw parts of the anatomy that I have difficulty implementing?<br><br>Also is there a guide or any tips for hair? I can't build on a hairline, every time I draw the head looks too big because of the hair.</br></br>  Requesting this fusion chart, thanks in advance.<br>Of Futayo Honda, Angela, and Jun the Swan</br>  <br>if you want to draw lewds, go to /h/ or /e/ to draw them not here. by drawing lewds here you are supporting people requesting lewds on /a/ which in turn cause people to request more lewds and clog the threads in requests the majority of drawfags do not want to do.<br>you have no reason to do them here when /h/ and /e/ are open and have plenty of requests.<br>your laziness to not change boards which takes less than a minute is not an excuse.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not problems, it's just a lewd request on top of other lewd requests is not going to stand out. There are drawfags lurking here waiting for something interesting, non-lewd to draw and if you request more lewd stuff you're not going to interest them. If they wanted to do lewd stuff they would be doing it by now.</br>  <br>For the former question, I think both have a place.<br>Probably best to go with singular pieces and then move onto full body pieces with a focus on poses using said pieces.<br><br>I'm not an artist though, I just have a few of them as friends.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Try to define a proper head prior to trying to add hair. If your head is the correct shape, draw the hair falling or hanging off it as hair would naturally. While referencing reality won't teach you how to draw anime, it'll teach you how to keep sense in mind when doing things (He said hypocritically)<br><br>Also, I would recommend doing tonnes of full bodies, torsos, limbs, hands, and face studies. Not a few of any, many of every. Doing all the parts individually may be the better option first, but you don't want to not learn how to properly stitch them together and how the musculature between them works, it's just as important as the main bodies of anatomy itself.</br></br></br>   General during weekdays.   Requesting Chitose coughing up blood with one hand holding her stomach while the other is holding a katana.<br><br>http://imgur.com/a/U1Zbh#0</br></br>  <br>I agree, for sure... as I said, I think it's bad for the board too, I'm not disputing that.<br>Between browsing /a/ generally, I tend to spend more time in the /v/ drawthreads though... and my requests there aren't lewd, especially since it's saturated too.</br></br>  <br>if only the requests were as interesting as blazing saddles I'd ditch the wwd for good.<br> you also left WWD in the name. </br></br>  <br> implying that's not the WWD on sunday. </br>  Tamamo celebrating No Bra Day by wearing her left outfit without her bra on; make it more teasing the viewer.  <br>Hot damn, this makes four.</br>  Requesting Kurumi Tokisaki playing with kittens at an animal shelter.<br>Like maybe her using some cat toys to play with them, or her taking a nap with all of the kittens lying on her as well.</br>  <br>requesting tamamo pleasing 4 dicks</br>  Requesting a straight girl being surrounded by horny lesbians, with nowhere to run  Also since I've been doing separate requests with different types of bikinis, how about I put all the references in just one pic, and let the drawdude decide the style and the girl.  Requesting busty waifus trying to touch their elbows together behind their back.<br><br> Tree captcha, why? </br></br>  <br> leaving out the best bikini type </br>  I've spent months on these threads<br>and have finally realized that /m/ has the same thing too holy shit</br>  Collecting some data.

As we become more inundated with more and more erotic things. They start to lose their touch reducing the amount of arousal we get. <br><br>It's a slow decline but let's not be faggots about this. Let's run down this fucking hill at full tilt and see where this ends up.</br></br></br>    <br>It cycles. I've had times when I wouldn't even admit on /a/ the kind of fetishes it took to get me off, but then I moved right onto binges of pure cute vanilla for months, then back on a downward slope again.<br><br>There is no bottom, just a flat circle.</br></br></br>    <br>Hungry skeletons.</br>  <br>this nigga knows, requesting more Nyaruko</br>        <br>My waifu's.

Otherwise something like a halter top and short-shorts!  Why did Touma punch such a beautiful lady?  <br>Manlet rage. He knows he's laughably short and can only express his pain by punching people.</br>  <br>She wasn't living her life correctly</br>  <br><br>There are so many better things to be done with her.</br></br>  <br>Like what?</br>  <br>because she has a shitty personality</br>  <br>Let her trample my face.</br>  Because he's a tranny exhibitionist with huge implants.  <br>God she's so hot<br>I would drag my dick through a mile of broken glass just to hear her fart through a walkie talkie</br></br>  <br>Simple</br>  <br>alphamax please go</br>  <br> this is a catholic nun </br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>To destroy that illusion of hers, of course.</br>  <br>She wasn't living her life correctly</br>  <br>Why do fish swim?</br>  <br>Because he's actually gay and anyone who says otherwise is a deluded Touma fag.</br>  <br>He can't be gay. Touma is asexual. Like, even an amoeba would have more libido than he does. It's a fact that people in Index do not ever have sex under any circumstances whatsoever, no exceptions.</br>  <br>Because he wants to hit that.</br>  <br><br> Oriana was a nun who became a stripper mercenary <br><br>Oh god that's hot.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Cause being Alpha means you don't let hot women play you like a fiddle anon.<br>You probably fidget and stutter.</br></br>  Why does her hair change every scene were the animators dropping acid or something?  <br>worst girl</br>    <br>is Index</br>  <br><br>Sherry Cromwell*</br></br>  <br>At least she doesn't appear as often as Index.</br>  <br>she wasn't living her life correctly. And he liked big breasted onee-samas. He was hoping to pop her into his harem with a one of his patented pimpslaps of justice.<br><br>it  half worked.  </br></br></br>  <br>Because he believes in Gender Equality<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kyt<wbr>O5uUExXo</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Because he totally hit on her.</br>  <br>That was a strange ending, she wasn't the villain, she wasn't the one who needed that punch, there was no reason for her to freak out so much but it was her who got punched in the end.</br>  <br>Big boob onee-chans are his type though.</br>  <br>good taste</br>  <br><br>She fucked with his homies and was trying to make a mess of his city, pretty good reason I'd say.</br></br>  Just read NT7. <br><br>So that guy pretending to be #6 was a fake. I get that but according to the Agitate Halation plan all the Level 5's should have shown up. <br><br>Does that mean the #6 was there and we just didn't see them? Also can we safely assume that because Rensa can't copy Gunha's powers that #6 mustn't be a gemstone?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Touma's gotta break her illusion so she can hear music again and reunite her with her other half and all that jazz. Plus those that get punched get added to the harem anyway.<br><br>I hope Shutaura eventually reappears in a future volume.</br></br></br>  <br>was wondering that myself her hair changes every other scene. <br>guess the animators were having a waifu war</br></br>  <br><br> he totally didn't have a huge hydra boner under those bed sheets looking at a total bomb shell that is Kanzaki Kaori </br></br>  <br>He wasn't thinking clearly at the time.<br>Oriana is for  Sweet and tender loving cowgirl so she can look you in the eye/smother you with her breasts </br></br>  <br>what's going on there? she rescued a loli from a stripper? if index s3 ever gets made will she appear again?</br>  <br>Maybe in S4  (ha) , she only shows up again once in one of the later volumes.</br>  <br>I think she's taking a lost little girl back to her mom.<br>Reading the novels and learning about her back story actually makes me feel bad for sexualizing her.<br>Her whole goal in life is to basically help people and the reason she messed with AC and Touma is because she thought it was the best way to the unite the world and help everyone as best she can.<br>She's actually a very sweet girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br>why does she dress like a stripper though</br>  <br>triggered</br>  <br>Alright I can't find any morally justifiable reason for that other then can you blame her?<br>If you looked like a goddess of fertility would you wear a habit your whole life?<br><br> "Do magicians really not realize how odd they <br>look?‖<br>―…‖<br>Kamijou silently stared at Oriana‘s body, but it seemed she didn‘t notice the irony."<br><br>She might not fully realize it herself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, /fit/</br>  Oriana is just so much wasted potential... but that's pretty much the lead motif in the index series so it fits in well.  <br>Index is making him so frustrated with females that he can't help it.</br>  Because Raildex has shit writing and is meant for people too pretentious for Narutardshit to eat up.  <br>this exactly</br>  <br>Yes its Aogami Pierce</br>  <br>Fuck off. Under what evidence?</br>  <br>Because every character from idiotic trio must be relevant somehow, and so far he wasnt</br>  <br>Ah. So no actual evidence. <br><br>I'm guessing it's within the same tier of theory as Accel's "There was an experiment to stop cellular aging within the Imaginary Numbers District" comment about Komoe?<br><br>IE it's possible but it's not like there's evidence for it?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You just don't understand its greatness.</br>  <br>Number 6's power is different from other level 5. It probably has some connection with magic. He's probably has similarities with Tsuchimikado</br>  Was the movie from the LN or was it an original story?  <br><br>She's in English Civil War, which would probably be covered in S3</br></br>  <br>Original but written by the author of the novels and the events have been mentioned a few times in the novels that came out after it.</br>  <br>In NT12 it's revealed that  the number six regularly gives out his identity to people who are less well off than he is who could use the name/reputation of a level 5 to better their situation.  As for agitate halation, he could've been there? I don't think he'd be drawn into fighting though.</br>  Serves her right, she's a blonde. <br>I'd gladly punch every single one of those bitches.</br>  <br><br>Aogami Pierce is best #6</br></br>  <br>/thread<br><br><br> Fisting </br></br></br></br>  <br>He was feeling threatened by her height</br>  <br>At least she's not a pooskin.</br>  <br>Blondes are worse than niggers.<br>At least niggers are just dumb animals who don't know any better. Blondes are actively malevolent cunts with zero empathy or compassion who just want to make you suffer for their amusement.</br></br>  <br>They both need to be put down on sight.</br>  <br> he's not a blonde Nordic or Germanic <br><br>Quick lets point and laugh at him</br></br></br>  <br>Nigger loving faggots like you are the reason the US is going down the shitter.</br>  <br>Niggers should be put down like animals.<br>Blondes should be slowly tortured, murdered and dismembered.<br><br> being a subhuman snownigger <br>No thanks.<br><br><br> implying I like niggers <br>It's just blondes are so subhuman, they are worse.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Niggers should be put down like animals. <br><br>Why waste all that money when you can get sport out of hunting them?</br></br></br>  <br> just read NT7 <br>Oh boy, you're on for a wild ride.</br></br>  <br>Because being animals is the natural state of a nigger, so they'll be more experienced in surviving than urban kiddies with guns.</br>  <br>my theory is Rensa's power is based on #6<br>screen cap this if ya want</br></br>    <br><br>I think that the true number six send the fake there. So even thought he didn't come personally, he did intervene to stop the "heroes".</br></br>  <br> implying I'm wrong </br>  <br>That's all part of the thrill of the hunt.</br>  <br>#6 has connection with magic. That's my theory</br>  <br>This. Touma always loses his shit when a magic side shitter fucks with one of his friends who isn't involved in that nonsense.</br>  <br>Doubtful. In any case, the whole point of the character and his ability is that no one knows who he is. Revealing his identity at this point would ruin it.</br>  <br>Himegami was never relevant again</br>  Reminder kakine is the true No.1 esper of AC.  <br>Please go back in the fridge Kakine.</br>  <br>go away volley ball</br>  <br>/poI/ is leaking again</br>  <br>Since when does /pol/ hate blondes?</br>  <br>He's a lolicon.</br>  <br>Loving delicious flat chest doesn't make you a lolicon. <br>Speaking of btw. Wasn't Misaki pettanko when Touma fell for her?</br></br>  <br>But its not ranked by the power but how useful esper is to researchers so whats the point of those numbers anyway</br>  <br>That's what a weak jealous fag would say. <br><br><br>Only the strongest get ranked at the top.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah man because Gunha is weakest of level 5 espers right? Im pretty sure he could beat everyone other than first and second.</br>  Have you ever curious on who is the level 5 who can be penetrated by Mental Out?  <br>I was expecting this to the the first response.<br><br>You threw it off, so fuck you.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Index manga <br><br>Are we still on the ice boats?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gunha never wins a fight.</br>  If she wears a belt why the fuck doesn't she actually use it?    why is it that the girls touma is attracted to are the complete opposite of what the majority of the fans like?  <br>Same reason he punches everyone else: she wasn't living her life correctly.</br>  <br>That can't be right. That would actually mean that #6 is not only sane but also incredibly reasonable, which is impossible for a level 5.</br>  <br> ―Uu… Although this isn‘t the case, your warmth has infected my entire body. I really feel <br> like handing myself over to you……‖ <br> Seeing Kamijo complaining like this, Fukiyose closes one eye before smashing a fist into <br> the back of Kamijo‘s head, causing his head to sink into the breasts of the painter nee-san. <br> That nee-san didn‘t shriek, as she gently pushes Kamijo‘s head aside, saying, <br> ―Haiz. Let me see, are you alright? You, cannot, fight, on like this forever. It‘s rare to have <br> such an activity, so of course you have to make some wonderful memories.‖ <br> Wah, Kamijo‘s looks like he‘s going to cry. <br> ―So magnanimous! So completely different from those girls who bite others and those who <br> give others a punch! I‘m about to sink in this warmth!‖ <br> Kamijo shouted out, ―Watch closely, this is a mature woman; watch and learn, you iron wall girl!‖ <br> This is an apology for knocking into you. Normally, you Japanese would lower your head <br>to apologise, but we normally do this.‖<br>―Ah……that‘s how it is?‖<br>―Ara ara. Do I need to give a kiss?‖<br>Poof!! Kamijo does a spit-take.<br>After trembling for a while, the pure and innocent Kamijo Touma shouts,<br>―I WANT A KISS!!‖<br><br>Touma really needs to run into her again so she can just give him a big soft hug so he can heal from all that torture.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This blonde bitch wiped the floor with Tsuchimikado  <br><br> Touma was able land a punch on her  <br><br><br>Why is it everything that Touma does such bs?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Touma wants someone he can depend on, not someone who depends on him.</br>  <br>Gunha's actually ability is Jobber King.

I'm sure that if he were a catholic preist or the like you would have no problem, but of course, since he's from an LN, the reasons given have to be retarded, right?<br><br>YOU are the worst sort of poster on this board, because you give absolutely no consideration for charactization whatsoever and just superimpose your own values over everything.

Please, enlighten me with your brilliant explanation that isn't "Well the pants on head retard explanation is only so they don't have to actually develop things, they don't actually have to follow it in the context of the characters actions that don't jeopardize the status quo."<br><br> YOU are the worst sort of poster on this board, because you give absolutely no consideration for charactization whatsoever and just superimpose your own values over everything.

You're the one who's baselessly assuming that things make no sense before actually examining them. For the sake of your massive reading comprehension skills, I'll say it a third time: it's not a case of "Well oh they said this so it's ok even if they don't follow it", its a case of "well they gave a rationale for his behavior but he is developing and won't stick to it forever".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are too upset, you do know you're talking about anime right?</br>  <br>Oh wow</br>  <br>Now this is aspergers</br>  Jesus fucking christ.  <br>im gonna need the name of that anime</br>  <br>Wank the Wanko</br>  <br>Looks like that bitch from that zombie manga.</br>  <br> how to spot the newfag </br>  <br>Google the image.</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>Its my fucking dick.<br><br>Learn how to read filename, retard.</br></br></br>  This isn't fucking fair.  <br>My Little Zombie Can't Be This Moe</br>    <br>Korean Zombie Desk Car</br>     BD nipples <br>my dick has reach rigor mortis levels of stiff</br>  Is there a decent story to this or should I just bust out the lotion and go at it?  <br>I liked it, it was cute, but it was trumped by the occassionally glorious service</br>  <br>Really good.

For example, Star Platinum is Rank A in Developmental Potential during Part III: Stardust Crusaders, but is given Rank C during Part VI: Stone Ocean, as Jotaro has had many years to hone Star Platinum's power, but it's Rank C position means there was still some of Star Platinum's abilities Jotaro hadn't discovered.<br><br>For a Stand to gain an E-Ranking, it means that either their stand user discovered all of their Stands abilities, or the Stand came with very few abilities and thus cannot grow any more than it has.<br><br>So since Heart Breaker is basically one ability that is God, it's less that the stand has no utility but that the user has mastered its use. So having E rank Potential with this stand is actually more broken than a higher rank.<br><br>GGWP</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dat name tho</br>  Stand Name: 「I Break Mirrors With My Face In the United States」<br><br>Stand Ability: [Air Manipulation](http://powerlisting.w<wbr>ikia.com/wiki/Air_Manipulation)<br><br>Power - A<br><br>Speed - B<br><br>Range - A<br><br>Durability - D<br><br>Precision - B<br><br>Potential - B<br><br>Description: The power to manipulate air.

No moeshit. No tropes. Just a touching story that goes from A to B without appealing to manchildren who want to be eternal high school students  <br>....its kind of depressing most modern series are nothing but moeshit and tropes.</br>   learn moon <br> rewatch haibane renmei <br> finally understand the name stuff <br><br>I wish they hadn't discontinued the novel</br></br></br></br>  <br>Except it's not slice of life at all, it has a solidified plot which kicks into gear from episode 6 and never really returns to "Rakka goes around doing odd jobs".</br>  <br>There is a way to say what he wants to say and what you want to say and that would be<br><br>Haibane Renmei is what I wish slice of life were, so it comes out as "how slice of life should be"<br><br>The reason why you're saying Haibane Renmei isn't slice of life is because you're taking other anime that became standards of slice of life and using it as a standard of comparison.<br><br>But what that poster wants you to do is use Haibane Renmei as the *actual* standard of slice of life, and use it to compare it to other anime. Haibane Renmei has slice of life features in the beginning but also has a heart and a plot and that's what the standard of slice of life should be, not what you're taking it for to begin with.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There was a novel?</br>  <br>was it a novel, was it a doujinshi, now I don't really remember but there was some material going on before the anime aired and it was cancelled because of the anime<br><br>I think it was called "old home no haibane-tachi"</br></br></br>  <br>Aaaaah....<br><br>I read that. It's really just a full chronology of Reiki's running away from Old Home.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you know the other meaning of Kuu's name?</br>  <br>It's the other reading of the kanji sora (sky) 空, "クウ”<br><br>The reading "kuu" for sora usually means "empty" or "void" but in this case it literally means sky<br><br>I guess it's obvious from the opening scene as she is looking to the vast sky iirc.<br><br>Reki's would be a big mindfuck if I were watching it for the first time with the knowledge though</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How do the true names work?</br>  <br>So that means that, no matter what, Kuu was destined to perform the Day of Flight?<br><br>.... see this is why I don't buy the idea that she was a suicide?</br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but iirc they were different kanji which have the same pronunciation as the old ones. So your spoken name remains the same but the meaning changes. I don't remember anybody's alternative name though.</br>  <br>Hold your heart anon, here it goes I'll try to make it simple<br>Reki's name comes from the kanji 礫 you have 2 readings for this kanji, "koishi" and "reki" (which is how's she called), which means pebble<br><br>but forget reki reading for a sec and just focus on koishi reading.<br><br>Koishi is also a way to spell small stones with 2 kanjis by using 小(ko)石(ishi) 2 kanjis, the first 小 means "small" and the second 石 means "stones"<br><br>I remember on the anime she says that her name stemmed from the kanji "koishi" 礫, but then the mindfuck is when she says<br><br>"'Reki' is the small stones(小石) that represents pebbles (礫), the true name was something teared off... 轢 (Reki)(which means runned over) "<br><br>Now you notice how beautiful this is you got these two kanjis 礫 (reki, koishi, pebbles) and 轢 (reki, runned over)<br><br>Now notice how similar they are, they are identical except for the left part on the kanji, look very closely you see the kanji for koishi 礫 has 石 (stone) on the left side, and the kanji for 轢 has the radical 車 (car) on the left side.<br><br>it's a little hard to understand but just try to observe 轢(runned over) and 礫 (small stones) and you'll see the difference<br><br>Now my mind was blown was not only on the choice words but the choice of verbs, when Reki said "the true name that was teared apart" the verb she used for tear was 引き裂かる (reads hikisakaru), and the verb to be run over is 轢 (reki) and the verb was "hikaretanda" (conjugaded as runned over)<br><br>So she says "hikisakareta mono...sou hikaretanda"<br><br>So it was a very smart alliteration with the "hik" and makes you understand why she used that verb for "teared apart", her true name was teared apart because she was runned over.<br><br>My face when I saw that scene again</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yeah.<br><br>Yeah, they were dead.</br></br>    <br> Slice of Life <br> Story that goes from A to B <br>But that's wrong. The point of the genre is to NOT do that. I don't like SoL but it is what it is and that means some other fags are liking it that way. Let them have their fun.</br></br></br>  <br> Haibane Renmei <br> Not moeshit </br></br>  <br><br> Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World. <br><br>Fuck that book. Fucking ending was shit.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Haibane Renmei is one of the best moeblobs ever.</br></br>  <br>By the way there's actually more stuff and I just can't remember everything, but that scene was really really amazing I could probably make a few posts more about it but we're cool like this</br>  <br>MAKE MORE POSTS<br><br>We need to keep this thread alive!</br></br></br>  <br>Every good thread goes beyond page ten eventually. This one's not going anywhere just yet.</br>  What are some of the theories of this show?<br>I finally got around to watching it around 6 months ago but they are never any threads.</br>  <br>...dammit anon you're making me remember how much Rakka looked up to Reiki. She wanted those moments with Reiki to never end ;_;</br>  <br>Depends on what you are looking for. Aska question and you'll find different theories. Like Lain, it should be noted that every person ahs their own different take of Haibane Renmei, and no two opinions should be 'too' similar.<br><br>That being said, tis not as avant-garde or  pretentious  as Lain, so Haibane Renmei makes sense, yet, still leaves enough mystery for interpretation and self-reflection. A Christian take on this series is as possible as an agnostic take and a Buddhist take.</br></br></br>  We know that Reiki was a paint, but do you think Rakka would have learnt to paint, to try and recreate the likeness of Reiki?<br><br>Also, would Rakka have eventually taken over Reiki's job? I can't imagine her collective light leaves under the Glie's walls forever.</br></br>  <br>Well, the production was extremely small. The budged was almost non-existent. Also, the TV partly financing it where it was airing was quite fucking with the show. Practically no promotion, insane timeslot and airing shifts viewers weren't aware of and such shit caused that at the time the show was airing almost no one knew about it. But built decent following in Japan over time.</br>  <br>Alright.<br><br>Take from my previous post I focused more on the runned over thing, but check this out her sentence was this<br><br>レキは小石を現す轢だが、真の名は引き裂かれたもの、礫だ。<br><br>Now this is when you have to hear her voice saying, pronouncing each word so you can fully understand how incredible this is<br><br>The way to read is<br>"Reki(レキ) wa koishi(小石) wo arawasu tsubute (礫) daga, shin no na wa hikasareta mono, sou da hikaretanda" <br><br>Take the first part before the comma<br><br>Reki wa koishi wo arawasu tsubute.<br><br>This translates as "Reki is the small stones that represents throwing stones (tsubute)"<br><br>Tsubute as a reading for 礫 (reki) means "stones that you throw"<br><br>As far as my interpretation goes it really ought to have something to do with misfortune and separation, "tsubute" for throwing stones usually means the ones you throw at people.<br><br>As for the aliteration that's when she says "そうだ、引き裂かれたる者。そうだ轢かれたんだ"<br><br>If you memorized all the kanjis from now you should see them "teared apart 引き裂かれる" (hikisakareru) and runned over 轢かれたんだ (hikaretanda)<br><br>The whole thing reads "Sou da, hikisakaretaru mono. Sou da, hikaretanda"<br><br>Translation:<br>"That's right, what was teared apart. That's right, what was runned over"<br><br>You notice if you read the original japanese you can see it just sounds very poetic with alliteration.<br><br>Man, that scene was really good. It's kinda hard to understand though, maybe one day I'll draw a picture or something</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That reminds me.<br><br>Why do people still remember/like this show years after its airing? I don't deny its one of my favourite shows of all time, but I am impressed by its lingering memory/presence.</br></br></br>  <br> "Reki(レキ) wa koishi(小石) wo arawasu tsubute (礫) daga, shin no na wa hikasareta mono, sou da hikaretanda" <br>Ugh, I haven't slept too well lately, should've double checked this. The second part after the comma is not "sou da hikaretanda" it's actually "Reki da" (礫だ)<br><br>That doesn't harm anything on what I said though so you can read at peace.<br><br>Not that anyone will take their time to read this anyway</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's one chapter doujinshi which freatured only the basic idea and nothing more. I think I have never seen more than three pages out of that.<br><br>Then there's one volume doujinshi the anime was based on. It provided only a basic setting and characters. In anime Yoshitoshi is scedited with script but director Tokoro Tomokazu actually provided much help and thanks to him got the whole idea and story shaped up.<br><br>After anime aired there was published a special artbook which featured some material created before the anime, production notes, art by Yoshitoshi and even some information explaining on the anime and its symbolism. I think the scans are available somewhere but not sure if they are translated.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I think I read that back in 2010 and all I remember was a message by yoshitoshi saying he won't write the doujinshi anymore since they're animating the series</br>  <br>Don't be so pessemistic. Of course people read it, I'm not sure how much of it I actually understood though.</br>  <br><br>I remember a bunch of TL notes on that last episode and I still didn't get much of it</br></br>  <br>sum up what he said<br> the kanji of stones and kanji of runned over are almost identical and seve as a pun <br> the verb tear apart and the verb runned over sound very similar and both said together in the sentence sounds like nip poetry <br> the kanji for small stones is a pun on throwing stones which may mean what brings misfortune on others <br><br>that's what I got from it anyway</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>These? The first two pretty much cover the same material in the first two anime episodes, while the last is a flashback to Reki's early years. There have been scanlations of all 3 out for years.</br>  <br><br> &gt;a pun on throwing stones which may mean what brings misfortune on others <br><br> &gt;You now remember that Midori threw rocks at Reki <br> &gt;and that Reki was ostracised from everybody else because of ehr black wings <br> &gt;probably because they most likely thought she'd bring misfortune <br><br>The feels.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All of this in 2 sentences<br><br>Shit man, legit one of the best written original anime i've ever seen<br><br>Whoever thought of this was really damn original, I really enjoyed watching this after learning moon.<br><br>A lot of stuff made more sense</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy</br>  <br> &gt;Whoever thought of this was really damn original <br><br>aBe Yoshitoshi was the writer of Haibane Renmei and most likely came up with its names, dieas and themes.<br><br>Its why I prefer both NieA_7 and Haibane Renmei to Lain. aBe didn't write Lain &amp; Texhnolyze, Konana did. That explains why it ahs such a heavy-handed cyberpunk element.<br><br>But aBe's dieas and themes hit more to home, and resonate with you. NieA was lakcing, and I still feel thata series like Haruhi Suzumiya better explored what NieA tried to explore. But dammit: aBe tried.<br><br>And for Haibane Renmei, he hit the ball out of the park. Its a very poetic and moving series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Great witch of pachel <br><br>It didn't have the same luck as haibane, and I'm never reading it<br><br>never<br>ever<br>never<br>ever ever</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why?<br><br>Just wondering. I haven't read it, but I'm wondering why you're emphasizing that you'd never read it.</br></br></br>  <br>My first contact with Yoshitoshi was when I was shopping for light novels and saw that LN "welcome to the NHK" and some friend of mine told me he was a huge fan of the illustrator<br><br>He also told me to watch haibane renmei too</br></br></br>  <br>I'd say it actually gains another layer in English (unless the meaning exists in Japanese, too?): one may say "the stone is cast/thrown" to mean a fate that is set in motion or a course that cannot be altered. Luckily enough, it could be, of course.</br>  <br>The doujinshis are really hard to find and you can find a few volumes, but not all them<br><br>I've been waiting for the first edition for awhile now, the ones I found are pre-owned</br></br></br>  Can we all agree this is worst ABe?  <br> yfw his worst blows the fuck out most of what comes out these days <br><br>I can agree on this at least</br></br></br>   you weren't born in the universe where haibane renmei is successful and moeshit is niche   Lain = Tex &gt; HR &gt;&gt;&gt; Niea  <br>I sometimes wish aBe had illustrated/designed some of the characters of my favourite shows.<br><br>I can think of one character that I wish aBe had designed, though aBe would most likely hate that series.</br></br></br>  <br>i would rather have an oversaturation of shit and having some fantastic niche shows 3 times a year<br>makes it alot easier to watch anime since i can easily sort out the shit</br></br>  <br>NieA_7 is awful, it's the worst thing he had involvement with by far.</br>  <br>I'm going to be polite, and say you're dumb. And of course, very wrong<br><br>~<br><br>The correct ranking is:<br><br>Haibane Renmei &gt;&gt;&gt; NieA &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; texhnolyze = Lain<br><br>Texh is depressing and nihilistic as all hell, while Lain isn't convoluted and hard to make sense of, if at all.<br><br>But NieA ahs somethign to say, even if it fails. And Haibane Renmei? Well, it pretty much could do what NieA couldn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Fuck's wrong with you<br><br>NieA may not be that well animated/rendered, but its FAR better than a lot of pointless shit out there in the market today. And its not pretentious like Lain. Hell, if I wanted a DECENT cyberpunk anime, I'd watch Dennou Coil.</br></br></br>  <br>Lain isn't pretentious. It's just written complexly.</br>  <br><br>Fuck fof back to your Lain thread<br><br><br><br><br>This is a Haibane thread here. Leave the folks at Old Home alone!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jesus fuck I didn't mean to start a fucking war. I didn't even say HR was bad. I meant to reply to </br>  <br>The first part from C81? I have a copy, but ABe doodled on it and I'm not going to break it</br>  <br>Agnostic take? As in we neither know the origins of the haibane and where they go afterwards and it's all existentialist? First of hearing an "agnostic take" of anything really.</br>  <br> Texh is depressing and nihilistic as all hell <br>Is that supposed to be an argument to why it's not as good as HR or NieA?<br> Lain isn't convoluted and hard to make sense of, if at all <br>Isn't it good to make your own interpretation of it all though? It's not as much of a clear story like Haibane but it sure involves themes and ideas that make sense once you link them in your own way.</br></br></br></br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/jltichpozp.web<wbr>m</wbr>  Hello, /a/, are you still waiting? Or have you accepted that it will never happen?  <br>Well, think of it this way::<br><br>You CAN'T prove that its an afterlife. You can't prove that there's a God in this series, nor can you prove that the Day of Flight would either take them to Heaven (the Christian take) or reincarnation/Nrivana (the buddhist take)<br><br>It could very well be that each haibane were created 'on the spot' and had what they thought were memories, but, may not be actually their own. Remember that the Haibane have no full memory of their previous lives, only their dream. This could be taken very liberally.<br><br>Also consider that the Wasshi are very vague on who constitutes the Haibane Renmei, what happens to the sinbound if they don't pass the test, whats beyond the walls, and so on and so forth. I have 'my' theories of the show, but I'm not gonna lie when I state that these theories are based on ( a) my interpretations and with that ( b) my biases.<br><br>Consider what Rakka said to Nemu in episode 5. They were writing a creation story, but Rakka suggested writing a God that 'sleeps'. Nemu found it disrespectful, but Rakka made an important point: its supposed to remidn the reader that its written by humans.<br><br>And thats the thing: how can we be certain that anything thats sacred/divine is definite. Heck, I'm being charitable by considering an agnostic take on this series, I'm willing to consider there could be an atheistic take on this series. Or that atheists may outright disregard it. *shrug*</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the Despera anime was announced six years ago </br>  <br> But it will. <br><br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-01-10/yoshitoshi-abe-despera<wbr>-project-is-moving-forward-with-new<wbr>-director/.83127</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>  He honestly believes that. <br>In all seriousness, I would love to have your naivety, anon. I would love to live in a beautiful dream that it will once be completed.</br></br>  <br> Isn't it good to make your own interpretation of it all though? <br>I feel like "interpreting" Lain is a bit more fuzzily defined. You have to figure out what's going on first, and then try to figure out what was meant, but ultimately the latter part seems fruitless. Computers sure are powerful? Cyberspace would be pretty weird to live in? Lain is really cute? All of these are true, but they just don't speak to me. It's like "well yeah, obviously that. And?"</br></br>  <br> Computers sure are powerful? Cyberspace would be pretty weird to live in? Lain is really cute? <br><br>All of those completely miss the point of what the show is trying to convey. Watch again and take notes. Don't spend so much time on the technology - it's not what Lain is about.</br></br></br>  <br>Its a personal/subjective argument. You like Texhnolyze, good for you.<br><br>But I hate it. I hate it because everyone dies at the end, some with a meaningless death. Life is already harsh, and I don't need a TV series to remind me of its harshness.<br><br> &gt;it sure involves themes and ideas that make sense once you link them in your own way. <br><br>Here's the thing. Haibane Renmei does the same thing, but, it has some concrete/definite imagery that you can actually make sense of whats going on. The only exception is the evry last episode of Haibane Renmei, where a certain sequence could have taken place entirely in a dream, or may have actually happened.<br><br>But in Lain, you have a lot of metaphorical/symbolic imageyr that looks nice but, when you try to dissetc it, it leaves too much to the imagination that, if a laymans ees it, he's going to write it off as the animators being pretentious. Look to episode 1. There's a scene where smoke rises out of Lain's fingers. What is the point of that? What is the point of the alien that peaked into Lain's room? (I have my own reading of it, but I'm just saying) What is the point of Lain seeing her doppelganger? Was she actually physically there? Or did her physical form take on a life of its own?<br><br>Do you see what I'm getting at? A series like NieA_7 and Haibane Renmei makes sense. But Lain is so interpretive that people who want a story with meat will easily write it off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I believe... I believe that Haruhi Season 3 will be made.<br><br>I believe it as much as Despera getting made and aBe finally making a Haibane season 2. Or at least a series that *he* himself wrote, thats like NieA and Haibane.<br><br>I also dream of a day when aBe wouldd raw Haruhi Suzumiya. Its a pipe dream, and it'll never happen.<br><br>But its fun to dream.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That sounds like no fucking fun whatsoever. I'll pass. Lit-Crit's bad enough without subjecting YOURSELF to it.<br><br>Or, see  who has explained it much better.</br></br></br>  <br><br>thank you anon, I enjoyed the anime but thanks to you I have a deeper appreciation for the work that was put into the subtleties of this anime.</br></br>  <br>Nothing you said is an actual critique of the show, and this layman you're talking about seems an awful lot like yourself.</br>  <br> I don't like Tex because it's not escapism <br>Tex was trying to show that life will always be shitty.<br><br> But Lain is so interpretive that people who want a story with meat will easily write it off <br>It's fine if you don't want to spend time interpreting stuff but it doesn't mean the show doesn't know where it's doing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, I understand where he's getting at. Lain is very complicated. If you want something to enjoy and think about on the first watch, Lain is not for you.</br>  <br>IIRC it was one of Grumpy Jii-san's favorites.</br>  <br> mature animes for mature peoples such as myself </br>  <br> &gt;life will always be shitty. <br>Yes, and thank you for pointing out the obvious. I'm not going to like a show for stating something we already have accepted. And there's nothing wrong with a certain amount of escapism.<br><br> &gt;it doesn't mean the show doesn't know where it's doing. <br><br>That, is where I want to disagree with you. I don't deny that both aBe and Chiaki had some clear intentions/ideas they wanted to portray in the show. And Lain was a multimedia platform that was also explored in game as well as an anime.<br><br>But I can't help but feel that they were a bit clumsy when making Lain. Consider that every series they made after Lain, even texhnolyze, had some level of concrete storytelling/symbolism. Those series 'made sense'. but Lain seemed too freeform. if anything, Lain would be at a time when aBe and crew were still trying to figure things out. And, my interpretation would be valid, sicne Lain is meant to be freeform.<br><br>So no, I don't think Lain is the masterpiece some make it out to be. Is it an important series? Well, why not. But its not 'that' great</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't like Tex because it's not escapism <br>Escapism is more aspect the person perceiving than the work itself. If you watch something to provide you a brief moment of relief from reality you are escaping. If someone else watches the same show but gains something from it like impulses for thoughts then the same shows becomes a valuable experience. That's why I value opinion that "Everything is interesting depending on which way you are looking at it." <br><br>If you discard that then everything is escapism since you watch/read it so it would provide impulses which life otherwise isn't providing for you (fun, thoughts, aesthetic pleasure, et cetera).</br></br></br></br>  <br> But I can't help but feel that they were a bit clumsy when making Lain <br>Does a story need to be precise for it to be called a "masterpiece"? Most art is abstract afterall.</br></br>  <br> Lain is very complicated. If you want something to enjoy and think about on the first watch, Lain is not for you. <br>To be fair, you don't necessarily have to sit down and think about the show for hours to guess the symbolism and rewatch it just to enjoy it. Sure, you have to pay attention a bit more but I just enjoyed the story of Lain. The convoluted visuals and overall narrative gave Lain a fantastic atmosphere.<br>Not to say that Haibane isn't amazing in itself, of course. It was just a lot more laid back.</br></br></br>  <br>The only anime series he gave five stars to were Haibane Renmei, Aria, Gunbuster, Bokurano, and Seirei no Moribito</br>  <br>I only watched Lain once, and enjoyed it a lot. But it just seems kind of hollow, like - what exactly was I enjoying? I don't remember. Can I just step out and trust that the magic will happen twice? Or would I ruin my memories of it by looking behind the curtain and seeing that it was all just random junk that doesn't actually follow any deeper meaning?</br>  <br>Which is weird, because I love all of those except for Aria, which is one of my least favorites.<br><br>Different strokes for different folks, I guess.</br></br></br>  <br>Not precise. But at least 'make sense'.. Whats the sense in seeing smoke arise from Lain's fingers? Or Lain eventually seeing the figures of people around ehr turn into shapes?<br><br>Another series did this kind of thing - Madoka. Especially the movie. But in the movie, and near the end, they gave a very concrete explanation as to why it was going on. But Lain doesn't do that.<br><br><br>There are different definitions of art. Consider that dipping a shark in a pool of plastic will not be conceived as art by a lot of people. (a cookie for anyone who gets that reference)<br><br><br>I guess another way to put is, "I have limits". I can't value everything. And I know what I like. Thats not say I won't consider a series in full, and I did watch Texhnolyze to the end in order to form an opinion about it. But no, I still don't like it.<br><br><br>Well I am a layman, thank you very much. I don't have time to invest into watching anime 24 hours a day, and my anime diet is very limited at best. I may have taken literature at university level, but I hated Sylvia Plath and Samuel Beckett's 'texts for nothing' with a passion. In contrast, a play like Amadeus, or even Marat/Sade actually makes sense, and are trying to say something.<br><br>I admit I have not watched a lot of anime, but I know what I like, and I know the type of anime, as well as the type of stories I like. And Lain isn't one of them. And I know enough people who have called the series 'Serial Experiments Lame". Do I think it has something for the people who treasure it? Well, why not. But its not for me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok, now your clearly just baiting.</br>  <br> &gt;give an honest opinion <br> &gt;its called baiting <br><br>oh lol<br><br>~<br><br>How about we go back to discussing Haibane Renmei?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not random, I can promise you that. When you're rewatching keep what you know in mind. Interpret everything as it would make sense within the story based on what info you've got.</br>  <br> &gt;Implying I'd rewatch it. <br><br>Anyway, can we keep the Lain discussion to the thread here  and keep this a Haibane based thread?<br><br>I think we were doing good for a Haibane thread, and I'm more interested in the anon who had noticed something interesting about the names.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it could be said that those examples could be merely red herrings in the story or the progressive delusions and degeneration of Lain's sanity/mind and the physical world around her.<br><br>I also think you have to realize it's a surreal series. A lot of the beauty/weakness of surrealism is in its superficiality: what you see is what you get. Its abstract symbolism is its strength and weakness.</br></br></br>  <br>Because it was good. Why shouldn't it be remembered?</br>  <br>I'm going to redirect you to my answer here <br><br>Lets keep this a Haibane based thread.</br></br></br>  <br>Cynical answer: because (evidently) pretending to understand Lain sends a much better signal of how refined your tastes are than actually understanding Haibane, which any idiot can do.<br><br>Reasonable answer: a lot of good shows just get forgotten because they never reached any kind of critical mass of viewers to sustain a fanbase. Haibane is one of the ones that toes the line - typically a good thread about it here will leave a 'tail' of other threads over time as people read about it, watch it, and ask questions here.</br></br></br>  <br>I think thats a comforting thought.</br>  First time I've ever heard/seen an anon saying japanese helped him understand something in an anime<br><br>So the kanji for pebbles is a pun for throwing stones and that was why they threw stones at reki<br><br>and the kanji for throwing stones is almost visually identical to the kanji of being runned over<br><br>I wish I could try to get this poetry thing, I can't read japanese for shit so I dont know how to pronounce all that but I fucking believe you</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> pretending to understand Lain <br><br>Why are just trying to antagonize?</br></br></br>  <br>ABe then: deep and poetic<br>ABe now: boatsluts <br><br>What the fuck happened?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I said it was cynical.

This was a really lovely thread and you're all great people  <br>Haibane Renmei is one of my all time faves. The story is just beautiful, it says more in it's 13 episodes than a lot of animes do in a full season</br>  <br>13 episodes is a full season</br>  I thought Lain was ok, but the story is too abstract and impenetrable to actually enjoy watching. It's one of those things you watch to talk to other people about what was going on, like EoE, not because it's an enjoyable watch. HR is the opposite, it's easy to get into so you can just sit back and be totally immersed in Old Home, it's comfy as fuck  <br>13 episodes is a half season. 26 episodes is a full season</br>  <br>spring summer fall winter<br>52 weeks in a year<br>52/4=13</br></br></br>  <br><br> &gt; <br><br>how about you just go back to reddit instead? you clearly don't belong here.</br></br></br></br>  Haibane &gt; NieA &gt; garbage &gt; Lain<br>Haven't watched Texhnolyze yet.</br>  Disagree.  <br>I always thought that Reiki painted the older haibane, or her dream, because she couldn't let go of the past.<br>Maybe Rakka might pick it up, but I don't think they would paint for the same reason.</br></br>  <br>Is it really that much easier for you to disregard something as garbage because you're too dumb to understand it rather than to give actual criticism?</br>  <br>They have wings and a halo, what else can this implies?</br>  Bump.  <br> &gt;he disagrees with me, so he must be from reddit <br><br>Classic.</br></br></br>  <br>Based post.</br>  <br>That's not what the post was talking about, but whatever</br>  <br>Well here's an actual criticism: Lain is pretentious and doesn't really have a point with tis surreal visuals. You can half-guess the story, but too much within Lain is so avant-garde that some people will write it off as pretentious (like smoke rising out of Lain's fingers, or Lain seeing a doppelganger come 'out of her')<br><br>Grnated there were concrete moments - like the end of episode 4, when Lain warded off the MIB with what seemed like a psychic attack. But the anime didn't have enough of these fairly concrete moments.<br><br>In contrast, you actually know whats going on in NieA and Haibane.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Lain is pretentious and doesn't really have a point with tis surreal visuals. <br><br>It's not, and yes it does. It's not concrete by any means, but there is a point to everything that is shown on the screen.</br></br></br>  Lats lain thread 404'd but there's a new one <br><br><br>This is my response <br><br>Please keep Lain discussion off the Haibane thread.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you don't want Lain discussion in the thread, stop fucking talking about Lain in the thread, then maybe people will stop replying.</br>    <br>Don't know what you're trying to convey, but don't deny it's your own fault. You didn't have to keep mentioning Lain if you didn't want it talked about.</br>  <br> Rekki will never hold me tenderly in her arms. <br><br>I may as well just drink Bleach now.</br></br></br>    <br>Let it go, anon. She had to move on.<br><br>That she was no longer sinbound was already a blessing.</br></br></br>  I like the idea that the town is populated by the souls of the best of humanity, to help guide the Haibane back to the light  <br>Actually, I have a different theory.<br><br> They humans of Glie are all angels. The crows too. And the toga are the angels who come to Earth from time to time <br><br>If anyone is interested, I can post my theory in full.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;he doesn't get the reference so he keeps making the same fucking mistake <br><br>Get gone.</br></br></br>  <br>Go ahead</br>  <br>Alright, ehre goes.<br><br>My theory is predicated on the following assumptions:<br><br>1. You can't actually die in Glie (but you can fall terribly sick for ages on end)<br><br>2. There is no sex in Glie. Also, the place is very mild mannered.<br><br>The justification for 1. is the scene where Hyoko did not die from the fall. He climbed a fairly high height from which he could've been killed. But he didn't die. The other is from another assumption - if Glie is set in the afterlife, how can you die within an afterlife?<br><br>The justificationf rom 2. goes something like this. In a scene where Reki gets angry with Hyoko and Midori, she shows an index finger. I took this to mean that she actually wanted to show her middle finger but, and because such an action may have been forgotten to her, she could only manifest it as an index finger.<br><br>Mind, you these are all assumptions but, and due to the ambiguous nature of the show, I work with these.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>With those assumptions, here's the theory:<br><br>The humans of Glie are actually angels who guide the haibane, the deceased into the afterlife.<br><br>One way to consider this is to note which humans are attached to which Haibane. Nemu's teacher and Kana's superior all have stereotypes that may exist in the actual world. While it could be argued that they'd exist in any setting, it could be possible that they are just normal humans. Perhaps but, it could also be argued that play a role specifically to guide a certain haibane to a set path (Reki becoming the teacher to younger haibane, Kana being the clockworker for the town)<br><br>The best way to udnerstand this is to consider that the humans of Glie harbour no ill-intent to the Haibane and have, from time to time, dropped hints that have helped the Haibane along their way. Any negative actions a Haibane does is usually of their own choosing, and not from intervention from a 'human'.<br><br>But what about the librarian, you might ask. She was pregnant. Yes, but, did she ever state whow as the father. She also did say 'a life from nowhere'. Assuming there is no sex in Glie, the humans in Glie auto-reproduce. Or rather, they get pregnant, but they only do so to reinvigorate a memory of childbirth and pregnancy to the Haibane.<br><br>The best way to think of this theory is to consider that there are no pregnant Haibane at Abandoned Factory.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So, what are the Toga then?<br><br>The Toga are two things:<br><br>1. Angels who have been delegated to leave Glie and collect items from the real world to help Glie seem mroe familair to the Haibane <br><br>or <br><br>2. Sinbound Haibane who did not receive the blessing but nonetheless perform the same duty/<br><br>I'm more inclined to 1, but I think 2 is possible.<br><br>Also, what is the Wasshi? Some have suggested that he is a sinbound haibane who knwos a lot, but, it seems out of character for a man, who is so enlightened of whats goes on in Glie, to have been sinbound.<br><br>So, to me the Wasshi is actually a 'human'. Or rather, an angel, and perhaps the caretaker of the city of Glie. Its 'mayor', so to speak. That he wears the fake wings and mask is simply a guise and symbol of status.<br><br>Then whoa re the actual sinbound haibane? Well, remember the silent temple workers who also fake wings? Those are the sinbound haibane - doomed to work at the temple and be silent.<br><br>A final though - the people of Old Home dug up relics that showed some of the history of Glie, from which Rakka learnt the hand signals. While I thought this may have hinted a much more ancient history to Glie, the Wasshi spoke as if the hand symbols and knowledge was already well known to them.<br><br>I think there's a lot more to the Wasshi then aBe is letting us know but, and for the moment, I shall pretend that he's a very big angel, simply doing his duty.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That being said, there is one possible criticism of my theory. The first is the one time some humans saw the Haibane as a 'lucky charm'. that behaviour wasn't very angelic. I agree, but I shall note that it wasn't malicious either.<br><br>Also, and back  - what about the dead bird at the bootm of the well that Rakka found? Well, Rakka also did say that she ahd another dream at the bottom of the well. SO here's a question: did Rakka actulally find the skeleton of a bird at the bottom of the well? Or did she 'dream' that she found it?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Nice, but I still think the humans of Glie are actually real humans.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If it's a pocket world I feel it's more likely they're volunteering dead humans from the afterlife or beings placed there for their role.</br>  <br>Artland could.</br>  <br>If its the latter, I'd call them angels because of said role.</br>  <br>dat quality</br>  Wow.<br><br>200 posts.
