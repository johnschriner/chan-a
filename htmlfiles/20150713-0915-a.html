[  HorribleSubs post <br> P.S. Funimation videos should have their colors fixed. Update your playback if you’re still seeing weird colors. <br>Does this mean that Funi quality is now good?</br></br>  <br>no</br>  what is the worst thing about Funi subs?  <br>They're crushing the colors through their settings. You can try to save things, but a lot of information is simply lost.<br>There's also other problems with their files. CR should get the subtitles from them and use some TV raws.</br></br>  no, funi is fucking awful<br><br>aquarion logos has fucking jaggies out the ass. how do you apply anti-aliasing to mkvs? this shit is horrible.</br></br>  <br>You mean HS. If there was a bot that could convert Funi hard subs that would be pretty cool, is that even possible?</br>  <br>No. Still hard subbed and still has poor quality.</br>  <br>It's better but not good. You can now watch them without barfing.</br>  <br>But are Funi subs videos that bad to start with? I mean, it's HS that fucks up thing or it is bad from the start?</br>  <br>You could potentially OCR it, but you would still have to edit it after to check if it garbled in places. Then you have to make sure it is timed with the new raw.</br>  <br>It's shit from the start.<br><br><br>Yeah sorry. I keep getting HS and CR confused. I don't know why.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're terrible video quality and hardsubs. CR rip I have no problems with but Funi is below what I consider acceptable.</br>  <br> I keep getting HS and CR confused. I don't know why. <br>Both retards.</br></br>  <br>OCR would work, but it would catch lots of non-subtitle stuff</br>  Why does CR do this to me? It's hurting my eyes, it's so messy ;_;  <br>Without even including it being hard subbed, the videos usually they have horrible banding and the lines in it look aliased/badly scaled.<br>Even CR usually has some banding, though it has gotten slightly better than it use to be (it use to be really obnoxious).</br></br>  <br>CR's banding sometimes are pretty much evident, especially when it comes to shows with light scenes.</br>  <br>I am just glad madVR allows for debanding with it. Makes things a lot more tolerable.</br>  <br>When I watch on an older device, I get worse banding from 10bit shit than CR, as well as frame skipping.</br>  <br> inb4 don't bully me please <br>I have to deal with vlc because mkv doesn't work for me (or, at least, it opens but the video quality is a lot different), but the banding really is annoying.</br></br>   vlc <br>Just install the Kawaii Codec Pack or CCCP. It basically sets up everything for you and after, if you need to, you can tweak it more (like increase the debanding strength etc).</br>  <br>for<br/></br>  <br> Does this mean that Funi quality is now good? <br>The video quality of HS 1080p files, Funi or CR-sourced, will usually be superior to most TV sources. Funi's hardcoded subs are still shit.</br></br>  <br>Already tried with CCCP</br>  <br>Funi is not better than a properly encoded TV rip.<br>No fucking way.</br></br>  <br> 1080p <br>Way to make yourself sound like a retard.</br></br>  <br>That's why I said most. In some cases you'll be able to get TV sources to look better with proper encoding and filtering. In other cases, where the show has significant amounts of &gt;720p content, no amount of filtering and proper encoding is going to make up for the lost resolution.</br>  <br>http://screenshotcomparison.com/com<wbr>parison/133734<br>http://screenshotcomparison.com/com<wbr>parison/132640<br>Way to make yourself sound like a retard.</br></wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br><br><br><br>Aren't 1080p HS videos just fucking upscales?</br></br></br></br>  <br>They are with a few exceptions where they are native (like nyarko). Also some shows have elements done in 900p as well, but that would still be an upscale to 1080p. <br>A lost are still 720p though.</br></br>  <br>Almost always. But there's two reasons to download HS 1080p files over HS 720p files:<br>- The HS 720p files are literally downscales, thus, they are almost always literally downscales of upscales. Funi-sourced 720p files are particularly awful. Daiz on these:<br> FUNi's 720p versions do seem to have been made with rather poor scaling <br>An example of this Daiz posted: http://diff.pics/delIo1okgxzB/1<br>- It's becoming increasingly common for anime to contain &gt;720p content, and last I heard (2012) CR and Funi were getting their anime from the studios on HDCAM, which is 1440x1080. I'd assume that at least some studios are probably using HDCAM-SR now which I think is full 1080p. For many shows, like Working!!!, some, but not all of the content appears to be &gt;720p, but still, that's content that is going to look objectively worse on the 720p file.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Oh boy, here we fucking go again.<br><br><br>Well, if the video isn't fucked like Overlord then yes, it's just so fucking much better.<br>You just have to add some debanding and splice in some TV raws over the subs and you have basically a great-tier raw before BDrips.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> splice in some TV raws over the subs <br> Funi rips <br>wat</br></br></br>  I guess this is the video quality autism thread so I'll repost for anyone who missed it:<br>http://screenshotcomparison.com/com<wbr>parison/134758<br>tl;dr: If you're currently using MadVR and Jinc chroma upscaling because NNEDI3 is too slow for you, it's time to update your MadVR and switch to super-xbr chroma upscaling.</br></wbr></br>  <br>You didn't drop that shit after Ep 1? That shit was fucking terrible nigga.</br>  <br>A recent example could be [Vivid] Owari no Seraph.<br><br>Will drop a list containing this season's anime &gt;720p.</br></br></br>  <br> A recent example could be [Vivid] Owari no Seraph. <br> splice in some TV raws over the subs <br>So they literally used a Funi rip and spliced in short, wide sections of TV raw content to cover up Funi's hard-coded subs then added their own subs? If so, shit, that's impressive effort.</br></br></br>  <br> literally downscales of upscales <br>I didn't know this. This is beyond retarded.<br><br> Funi were getting their anime from the studios on HDCAM, which is 1440x1080 <br>Interesting. I guess I'll be downloading 1080p for anything HS. Regardless, I'm guessing TV sources are still the way to go?</br></br></br></br></br>  Aoharu x Kikanjuu, 864p (Brain's Base)<br>GATE, 810p (A-1 Pictures)<br>ClassroomCrisis, 835p (Lay-duce)<br>WORKING!!!, 1080p (A-1 Pictures)<br>Shimoseka, 918p (J.C.

Let's ignore subs entirely, for one. Let's just discuss video quality. If a show has no &gt;720p content, then a properly encoded, properly filtered TV source is gonna be better. If a show has &gt;720p content then it gets more complicated. The HS file will have better video quality if the TV source isn't encoded and filtered properly to fix source defects and avoid creating new ones. This means downloading releases from competent groups. If the TV source is released by a competent group, then you're essentially going to have a tradeoff here. At least some of the 1080p HS file's content is going to look noticeably higher resolution, especially lineart and text (not subs). No amount of proper encoding, filtering and upscaling will change this. The TV source will probably have less artifacts and banding though, although the latter isn't an issue for users of media players with debanding. At this point I think it becomes a matter of personal taste.<br>Also, apparently Sentai sends fucked up content to CR and Funi, so properly done TV sources of Sentai anime are probably going to be better. Check out the white lines going through the lineart on the HS file here: http://screenshotcomparison.com/com<wbr>parison/134114<br>Daiz on that:<br> it looks like the result of poorly done IVTC or such. </br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> Basically, you return the show to its original size, nothing wrong with it. <br>That's assuming they use the proper downscaler to do this. That's a big fucking assumption given CR and Funi's track record of competence, and it does appear that Funi is, in fact, not using the proper downscaler to do it, because their 720p files look more like 480p.</br></br>  <br> WORKING!!!, 1080p (A-1 Pictures) <br>Confirming at least some of the content is full 1080p, like little text on menus and shit.</br></br>  Is there anything she can do?  <br>Bring back Ed's mom.<br>Make Vegeta win against Goku.<br>Make Muslims behave themselves.</br></br></br>  <br>Breed.</br>  <br>Find my car keys.</br>  <br>she can make my dick hard</br>  Itch her ditch.  <br>She can't love you.</br>  <br>this</br>  rock a bikini like it was a crime against decency  <br>I'd walk her plank.</br>  <br>Give me a fetish for women in business attire</br>    <br><br>Be best girl.</br></br>  <br>you forgot kill servants</br>  She is useful for same thing as every secretary.<br>Making coffee and serving as self-lubricating and moving fleshlight.</br>  <br>Can someone crop the boy out?

I don't like Prisma Illya at all, I want the VN Illya.  Heaven's Feel? Is that the FS/N Dedicated Edgy route?   on the horizon <br><br>Literally 2017 at the earliest</br></br>  <br>VN Illya is superior in every way.</br>  <br><br> Ilya will never get on all fours in your bedroom asking you to explain to her how the male body works <br>Why live.</br></br></br>  <br>Hollow Ataraxia in 2020?</br>  <br>This.

When did she pilfer Taiga's dressing room in UBW?  Daily reminder that if there was an Ilya route it would have no H scenes as Ilya is a mana battery and doesn't need any extra external mana source.  <br>Yeah just as Rin doesn't need mana from Shirou.</br>  <br>Are you implying the H scene in UBW wasn't completely forced in? At least it made sense, story wise, in Fate and HF.</br>  <br>It made as much sense in UBW as in the other routes.<br>Why wouldn't the connection work in both ways?</br></br>  <br>you mean the less popular and most hated of all? No one cares about emokura.</br>  <br>Not even close.</br>  <br>She does. As a third tier antagonist.</br>  Which Fate story has perfected the Holy Grail War concept?  <br>She's a cup that you fill with your semen.</br>    <br>Try harder.</br>  <br> best girl <br> gets off on senseless murder <br><br>try again</br></br></br></br>  <br>I just realized how dangerous Shirou's household is in HA. Rider and Saber are fucking idiots when left to their own devices, Remember what almost went down because they couldn't decide what to have for dinner? Shirou's too beta to coil them, Rin doesn't care because destructing his house could be a way for her to get him to live in that big ass mansion with her and the same goes for IIya. Sakura's a god send when that happens.</br>  <br><br>Implying a best girl can't murder?<br>Those things don't exclude each other, seems someone failed logic in elementary school.<br>Also, your inability of understanding her character as a whole amuses me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How the long does it take to finish HA?</br>  <br>The hero and heroine having sex before the climactic battle is a pretty common story trope.</br>    <br>I said "senseless"<br>Saber and Rin fought out of self defense or to defeat an evil prick.<br>Sakura killed because she's a emo girl who suddenly obtained vast power and immediately got drunk on it. I'll even be fair and not pin the Shadow's initial feedings on her, since that was beyond her will, knowledge, or understanding. Her killing Shinji is justified, going into a laughing fit over how easy it was and toying with his corpse for fun is not.</br></br></br>  I wonder what Sakura's dolphin looks like...  <br> blue <br> green <br>I guess Sakura's will be red?</br></br></br>  <br>Where can you find that Sakura was OK with killing people?<br>What we get from the VN is that she resented that nobody saved her from her situation and she was ready to give up on life but decided to cling to hope because of Shirou. It was only when AM started emerging that her Dark emotions got exploited and twisted.<br><br>As you see in the other routes she never killed anyone, because she was mentally stable, it was only in HF were her emotions were exploited to the max to bring birth to All the worlds evils.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Forever. You'll be there forever. That said, It's pretty funny that Rider's punishments by Sakura are time outs in a shadow dimension while Saber's punishments are no meat dishes for a week. Honestly Saber's more like a cute freeloading gajin in HA then the heroic king arthur of legend.</br>  <br> Her killing Shinji is justified, going into a laughing fit over how easy it was and toying with his corpse for fun is not. <br><br>She did? I could of sworn at that moment she declared herself evil or something and started going even more off the deep end with fragmented thoughts. <br><br>Still why the fuck did Nasu write her to where she says she's going to try and take Zouken out with her only for the narration to pop up and say she's already forgotten the thoughts as quickly as they leave her mouth? It honestly makes it hard to tell what's going on with Sakura's head other than, she's fucked up the ying yang and things are getting worse while zouken laughs his crusty wormy balls off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The technical term is retirement.</br>  <br>thank you didnt post that but have been wondering for a while</br>  Absolutely  <br>Every inch of my body is ready.</br>  <br>Doesn't sound so bad.</br>  Yup. Ready for true heroine.  <br>Pls don't bully Rider.</br>  Not really.<br>I'd be surprised if she got more than seven minutes of screen time. <br>I'll still savor every moment of it, though.</br></br>  <br>You took the bait.</br>  <br>Literally does jack shit worthy of being called a heroine.</br>  <br>I always wondered if that shit was supposed to represent the rapeworms or something.</br>  <br>To bad for you. She is still the true heroine of the novel tho.</br>  <br>Stay delusional.<br><br>Sakura is not the heroine of Heaven's Feel. She is simply a plot device/villain made to keep the story moving forward. She does not do anything worth calling her a heroine. Yes, she does in fact have sex with Shirou, not because she is the heroine, but because she is the love interest, two different things. This is also something that sets HF apart from Fate and UBW, the heroine and love interest are not the same person, like Saber or Rin.<br><br>You probably already guessed who the heroin of HF is, but before that you might be wondering, "Why did Nasu choose make the heroine and love interest in HF different but not in the other routes? He certainly had choices between rider, Caster, Ayako, Taiga, and so on." This is because, as we all probably know, there were originally mean to be four routes, not three. He was forced to merge the Illya and Sakura route for reasons. He always meant for Saber, Rin, Sakura, and Illya to have the same about of significance in the complete Fate/stay night story, but out of no where he had to axe either Sakura or Illya. He clearly did not want to do that so he found a way to bypass it, make one the love interest and the other the heroine, something he never considered for the other routes because he did not need to merge anything back then. And why is Illya the heroine? If you read HF you should already know, or just use google-<br><br> A hero or heroine is a person or character who, in the face of danger and adversity or from a position of weakness, displays courage or self-sacrifice-that is, heroism-for some greater good. <br><br>I'm just trying to clear up a common misconception. Don't let disillusion Sakurafags fool you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is beautiful, devoted and brave.<br><br>No bully!</br></br></br>  When is Heaven's Feel chapter 3 coming out?  <br><br>You are wrong on so many levels.And you have no idea why Sakura is the true heroine of the novel. Here let me explain you:<br><br>Sakura is the love interest and a plot device for the story, all that is true. But you are missing the most imporant point here and that is that she is the key point of everything that goes on in the novel. It doesn't matter if she was the one saving the day at the end or not, a heroine in culture media these days is define by her role in the novel as the most important focus point, not by her heroic achievements. In that regards she is a tragic heroine:<br>a : the principal female character in a literary or dramatic work<br>b : the central female figure in an event or period.<br><br>Heaven's Feel is the culmination of the novel and most mature route even stated by Nasu himself, because it finally gives Shirou a reason goal to fill the void of the Emiya ideal. In HF it is were the ideal is put to test and it brings the biggest and most important change in Shirou. Shirou needs Sakura not only because he wants to save her, but also because she wil save him from the emptiness of his nature, which is basically the whole point of the VN.<br><br>Now this connects perfectly with the main theme of FSN which is the growth of Shirou as a person. The introduction of the ideal in Fate, conflicts and resolve of the ideal and the salvation of the emptiness of the ideal with HF. Shirou knows the true Sakura is a good person and this is why he risks it all against all odds. He knows who she is and why he can achieve salvation with her, because the cycle of the ideal ends with person he truly cares about.﻿</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Illya <br> Rider <br> Kirei <br><br>Too bad we have to suffer through Sakura to get to the good stuff.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Best girl, indeed.</br></br>  <br>I now wonder what that punishment was exactly.</br>  <br>Kills all of the villains by herself. More of a heroine than Rin ever was.</br>   Cute as hell <br> Sexy as fuck <br> Loyal to the death <br>Best girl indeed.</br></br></br>  Heaven's Feel is an exceedingly flawed route hampered by a terrible heroine and a terrible "romance".<br><br>Sakura, as a character, is given hardly any time to become endearing to the reader. She is on the same level as Ayako in the previous two storylines, but suddenly she's thrown face first into the plot of HF, and her role is not a particularly likable one. It's split between mostly being helpless, with the last part of the route actually having her become the primary villain. She's a damsel who needs to be saved from Shinji, Zouken, the worms, the war, and ultimately herself.<br><br>She is pushed to the lowest of the low in the route, but unlike Saber and Rin, you don't have this established connection with her. If you saw either of those two in Sakura's state after two routes of being with them, you'd instantly be more invested in the situation than you would with Sakura, because, as mentioned, she's almost completely absent from the story before this. <br><br>This further becomes a problem due to the fact that despite her being the least developed, she's supposed to be the one who's known Shirou the longest, which actually ends up hurting the narrative as a whole. Because their relationship is already there, you, the reader, don't get to see much of the growth between them with your own eyes. You do with Saber and Rin. Shirou and those heroines respectively learn more about each other, get closer, and fall in love. With Sakura though, they're already "in love" roughly 1/3rd of the way through the route, so that whole plotline just kind of stalls right there.<br><br>This ultimately actually hurts Shirou's development in the story. Because Sakura is not shown in an extensive positive light, because you don't really see the proper development of their relationship, there's less of a connection with seeing Shirou abandon his ideals for her. It becomes more about abandoning them for the concept of a loved one, rather than Sakura as a person. She's an object. A goal. Not a character.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She learned from the best</br>  <br>The heroine of HF is Illya</br>  ONE<br>SINGLE<br>90 MIN<br>MOVIE</br></br></br>  <br> terrible "romance" <br>That's a given with Nasu. He has never written any other kind of romance.</br></br>  Posting again, because fuck this gay earth.  <br> "it's okay to like Sakura now" <br><br>That's a good joke.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nice try, lolifag.</br></br>  <br>Yeah yeah, show your real color, Rinfags.</br>   Rider will never ride you brutally while Sakura tongue your anus   <br>It's the truth. If it wasn't for Illya Sakura would never even get a happy end. You better be grateful that she sacrifices herself for your sins.</br>  <br><br> Terrible heroine and terrible romance? <br><br>Not sure is serious Anon.<br><br>Sakura and Shirous relationship is the deepest one in the VN even if she only showed a full appearance in the last route. Their relationship is the most mature and realistic one because it shows the tragic part of being in love. Shirou has to go tru so many troubles to save the person he loves even if he is hurt many times in the process, and Sakura showed how devoted she was to him from the very beggining of the novel, you just get the bigger picture in HF.Sakura and Shirou's relationship was well stablished during the cooking/house scenes that you probably skipped, because lolshonenboy, and it was cemented in Rain.<br><br>You are right on saying it was terrible romance tho, since what it was shown in HF was Love not Romance. In Fate we had a truly forced relationship between Shirou and Saber that basically came out of nowhere, plus it wasn't even close to realistic with Saber being a Heroic Spirit and Shirou a human. In UBW the true protagonist of the route is Archer, and Rin only has her time to shine in the fighting scenes, it was only in the Ufo adaptation that got a puch in the romantic side of her relationship with Shirou. Then in HF,what you see is Love where two people accept each other, including the painful reality that comes with it.<br><br>"I really did separate romance" and love with the heroines.<br>Romance is something where a couple blindly pursue each other's ideals. "Love," on the other hand, is something where two people accept each other, including the painful reality that comes with it. There are no ideals to be found there. It's just about coming to terms with reality. They don't even have time to dream... but you can't just keep pushing harsh realities over the hopes and dreams of young people.'' - Nasu<br><br>Also even Nasu ships Shirou with Sakura.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In anime version of her route she is the one who rapes Shinji, right?</br>  <br><br>Lol, she was going to die either way. #homunculusbody.</br></br>  <br> it was only in the Ufo adaptation that got a puch in the romantic side of her relationship with Shirou <br><br>Completely full of shit. Every bit of romance in the UBW anime was in the VN.<br><br>People really undersell the romance in the route and oversell Archer. Archer certainly is an important character, but he does not dominant the story like people like to say. Meanwhile Shirou and Rin's relationship is consistently developed throughout the entire story. It just takes a minor detour on day 15 when she gets kidnapped.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Archer is actually out of the plot for massive swaths of the story. There's even a point where Rin stops using him as a servant because she deems him not trustworthy.</br>    Heaven's Feel feels really stitched together to me. So much of it needs to be expanded on.  <br><br>You don't need to be physically present to be the main focus of the story overall tho.</br></br>  <br>The overall focus of the story is around Shirou, with Rin trying to come and understand him and help him.<br><br>Archer is consistently an antagonist who the vast majority of the cast distrust by about halfway through the story.

You're a little girl who should be playing with dolls!" - Seriously. Every single goddamn time. In a feminist anime, she would rise up and say "no eff you" and prove them wrong, but in F/Z she takes their words to heart and starts questioning herself and her noble actions. All of the other women are either plot devices or tools. When they finally show a strong woman (the assassin) she says near the end of her life "You know I secretly always wanted to be a mother, I just didn't know it..." In any other series this would have been fine, but in F/Z it was just more icing to the cake of misogyny.</br>  <br>Well what do we know, she is a little girl. Who the hell would vote for a 15 years old grill to run anything?</br>  <br>Sakura never really shines in HF until the epilogue. She's actually quite pathetic and frustrating to deal with throughout the route.

The anime went full retard there.</br></br>  How did Shirou trace Excalibur in the normal ending of HF? I know he had Archer's arm, and destroyed himself in the process of tracing, but isn't it said somewhere that weapons created by the gods such as Excalibur and Ea are impossible to trace? He was on his last projection, too, so how could he have enough prana to trace Excalibur? Even Archer can't normally trace Excalibur, nor can he reproduce it with Unlimited Blade Works.  <br>I can't read chicken scratch and 'fantranslations' sound degrading.</br>  <br>Read the wiki then you dumbfuck.</br>  <br> You don't vote for kings. <br>Elective monarchy is a thing, but obviously the vast majority of people did not vote for their king. It was more generally a case of, "99% of people don't vote for kings." Arturia just became king because she could shoot magical laser beams from her sword and had a futafag wizard vouching for her, though.</br></br>  <br><br>If i remember right it's like a bootleg excalibur.</br></br>  <br>Archer can project Excalipoor, so he projected Excalipoor.</br>  <br>The wikia is fanfiction-tier, newfag.<br><br> I was fucking with you this whole time, tripfag :^) </br></br></br>  Okay, Rin. Heaven's Feel. Someone please explain to me the rationale behind her actions in her fight with Sakura at the very end. She pulls a victory out of her ass with the Zelretch sword, manages to get Sakura to the point where she's emotionally collapsing and ready to surrender, and then basically says "So you've been raped, abused, and cornered all your life, and now you're crazy. Boo fucking hoo." What the hell?! How can she not tell that this is a massively bad idea? Did Rin have a real reason to do this, or is it just her idiot-magnet status coming back to take a bite out of her bum? It makes no sense to me.  <br>Simply epic.<br>And the wikia has always been ok, except for its shitty background.</br></br>  <br> Sakura <br> Best girl <br><br>Pick one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>French wikia is significantly better. I use TMdict personally, though</br>  <br> Really? I speak french yet I have never looked it up. </br>  <br>fr.typemoon.wikia.com/<br><br>typemoon-france.tumblr.com/<br><br>typemoon.fr/<br><br>http://tmdict.com/en/#en</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rin is a heartless bitch, nothing else to it.</br>  <br> Did Rin have a real reason to do this, or is it just her idiot-magnet status coming back to take a bite out of her bum? It makes no sense to me. <br><br>Yes. she was trying to amp herself up to kill Sakura there but in the end she floundered which lead to the terrified Sakura to stab her, which drives her even more crazy until shirou farts out rule breaker and dies to which IIya farts out a DEM to bring him back. God I hated that ending. I would of liked an ending where Rin and Sakura die but IIya brings back Shirou and herself traveling the world together instead.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't use photoshop</br>  <br> How did Shirou trace Excalibur in the normal ending of HF? <br>Excalibur wasn't created by the gods but it is still born from miracles. It is normally impossible to trace such artifacts, but Shirou and Archer can trace it to some extent due to some unexplained factors which I'm guessing is due to Avalon having Caliburn and Excalibur's memories. His traced version shatters after use and can't use the maximum Excaliblast but it is still quite powerful.<br><br> Even Archer can't normally trace Excalibur <br>Archer threatens to use Excalibur in Hollow Ataraxia even though he knows that he will immediately die after using one Excaliblast due to the magical energy required. It is also one of his attacks in EXTRA CCC but he can use it repeatedly here due to having a superior Master.<br><br> but isn't it said somewhere that weapons created by the gods such as Excalibur and Ea are impossible to trace? <br>Ea is made of some primordial materials that existed before the world was formed, so it is literally impossible for Shirou or Archer to replicate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Perhaps what helped Shirou traced it is due the fact the sword became corrupted and Shirou traced that version of Excalibur. However, it still took a tole on him to do so, I would say Shirou's corrupted Excalibur is about a C rank at best.</br>  <br> I would say Shirou's corrupted Excalibur is about a C rank at best. <br> &gt;&gt;/fanfiction.net/ </br></br>  <br>I remember some anon saying that in Extra he states he made it out of earthly material which is why it's inferior to the actual Excalibur, so basically it's just a side project that HF Shirou dug out of the arm.</br>  <br>Are you seriously implying Shirou can trace at the same level as Archer? Don't be retarded.</br>  <br>You are wrong, also HA is canon.</br>  Whenever she is fighting without her master around, why doesn't Rider ever just take off her blindfold and turn all her opponents to stone? As a matter of fact, wouldn't that be good just to do that in the first place because anyone who saw them would be turned to stone anyway...  <br> Are you seriously implying Shirou can trace at the same level as Shirou after the arm was implanted on him, granting him all of archers abilities? Don't be retarded. </br>  <br>Do you also fill it with Fanta after filling it with semen?</br>  I'm looking forward to it.<br><br>Kinda bummed that they'll obviously cut out the sex scenes. Especially since they are more important in the HF route.<br><br>I'm not expecting hentai, but what they did on the UBW movie was just jarring and didn't fit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Realta Nua exists.</br>   wormslut <br><br>not even once</br></br>   There are people who think Rider is dom <br>I fucking hate femdom fags</br>  <br>She does pretend to be dom, so it's easy for people to make that mistake.</br>  <br> She does pretend to be dom <br>at what point?</br></br>  <br>Bath scene is a good example.</br>  <br>Why didn't Archer snipe everyone?<br>Why didn't Lancer Gae Bolg everyone?<br>Why didn't Caster Rule Break everyone?<br>Why didn't Gilgamesh Enkidu+EA everything?<br>Why didn't True Assassin Zabaniya everyone?<br>Why didn't Kuzuki kung fu everyone?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Swords.<br>Ordered not to.<br> using melee attacks as a mage <br>Pride.<br>It hard to pull off.<br>It only works the first time, and sometimes people don't die when they are killed.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rider exists to be bullied.

You really didn't under the point of that scene was that Sakura couldn't hide her anger and despair behind another mask, not that she loved to kill people right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this is what HF cuck want to believe</br>  <br>Fuck off, Athena.</br>  Sakura is the greatest <br>My opinion&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;everyone else's opinion</br>  So when is UBW's second OST dropping?  <br>October.</br>  <br>Ahahah holy shit my sides. Who made this?</br>  <br>Holy fuck, that's why I hate 3D.</br>  <br> HD is out <br> still posting 600p versions of CGs </br></br>  <br><br><br>That Monty Python reference flew right above you two's heads, didn't it?</br></br></br>  <br>I honestly don't see this. Sure, there are parts of Heaven's Feel that make Rin seem incredibly callous, especially the bit where she says she hasn't a lick of sympathy for the horrors Sakura endured, but even that moment is immediately followed by Rin having one of the most enduringly Rin Tohsaka moments ever: the casual discovery that she was unable to kill her own sister until the very moment she had to do it. (Also, if you read the VN, Rin basically says that she had tricked herself into believing that Sakura was living a happy life because she wanted her sister to have a better life than she was as an orphan.)</br>      <br> &gt;Fails to understand that even if Shirou is resolved with his Fate, his fate is still to be betrayed and eventually live through an embittered lie. </br>  <br><br>The main issue is that some don't see that both sisters were at fault for their estrangement, Sakura desperately needed to get things off her chest, and let herself heal from it. Rin needed to be more honest and not say what she wanted to say to Sakura only in Shirou's presence. Even Shirou said that she should ease up and say the things she was saying to him, to Sakura. But at least Sakura tried to get the hatchet buried before things went completely to shit.<br><br>It was just a bad time for all these things to come out into the open. They honestly could have patched up years of shit with an honest, no bullshit talk. Wars aren't exactly the best place for family counseling, or which they both needed.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I wonder what the Type Moon version of Athena would look like.<br><br>We have seen Merlin, Scathatch, Ishtar, and so many mythological figures. The Greek pantheon is woefully unseen. Unless we count Herc of course.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There is tons of greek characters already, but they cant show all of them because there is a fucking tons of them in mythology. You can write 2 or 3 HGW only with Greek servants.</br>  HF is beautiful in the sense that Sakura is absolutely irredeemable to nearly everyone else but Shirou and he alone gets to be her knight in sword skin. Hell even Rin admitted to not giving much of a damn before she gets emotional.  Any speculation as to who the other voice actors will be playing?<br><br>Hero: Shimazaki Nobunaga<br>Mashu (totally not Shielder): Taneda Risa<br>Dr. Roman: Suzumura Kenichi<br>Proffesor Lev: Tomokazu Sugita<br>Olga Marie: Toyoguchi Megumi<br><br><br>Suzumura Kenichi (Kokutou Mikiya's seiyuu)<br>Ueda Kana (Rin's seiyuu)<br>Taneda Risa (Miyazuki's seiyuu (from KnK's Extra Chorus))<br>Sawashiro Miyuki (Canaan's seiyuu)<br>Namikawa Daisuke (Waver's seiyuu)<br>Endo Aya (Kogil's seiyuu)<br>Ohara Sayako (Iri's seiyuu)<br>Shitaya Norika (Sakura's seiyuu)<br>Ogura Yui (Passionlip's seiyuu)<br>Hayami Saori (Meltlilith's seiyuu)<br>Tanaka Rie (Kiara and Kirie's seiyuu)<br><br>I have a feeling some of them will be playing one of their previous roles that might make a cameo. Also, aren't there supposed to be a lot of new servants? Most of them will probably voicing multiple servants.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably didn't need to mention this, but I was talking about F/GO</br>  Heaven's feel taught me to hate people who victims of abuse, All they do is blame others for their own problems and end up a burden to actual good people. It's the same in real life. Rin may of been bluffing herself at the end but that's actually the correct attitude to have in the world be it magus or human. If she really didn't want to kill Sakura so badly why not ice her then kill herself if it means so fucking much to her? She and Sakura caused innocent people to die just because of their own damn problems  <br> that's actually the correct attitude to have in the world be it magus or human. </br>  <br> Heaven's feel taught me to hate people who victims of abuse </br>  <br> every Shirou goes to the middle east and gets betrayed by some blue haired scumbag  <br>Nah.</br></br>  <br><br>You realize it wasn't really her that did all that right?<br><br>*Facepalm*<br>And here we see how Sakura is the most polarizing character, because simple minded people cannot grasp her personality as a whole.<br><br>First of all you say it is all Rin and Sakura fault that the murdering happened, even tho it clearly only started to happen when Sakura was under the influence of AM. Yes she was jelous and mad about her situation which is completely understandable considered she never really had a chance to live a normal life. Sakura can't change her situation, unless she's willing to destroy the rest of the world in the process, and to me that's not noble. Instead she tries to move on and change her situation by finding a normal life with Shirou, the person who inspired her to fight for her dream on having a normal life. Of course we want rape victims to get out of their situation, but at the same time you can't blame victims for not actively trying to do, because there's ALOT of psychological, societal, financial at times, mental, emotional, baggage that prevents them from doing so. In fact those emotions were explotited by zouken to break her down little by little tru her WHOLE LIFE as a Matou and she only produced some negative thoughts without corrupting her existence until the climax of HF that we all know.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What? He's talk about the fact that even if he chooses to save everyone, there is fundamentally nothing different between him and Archer given that what they want is impossible. The only difference is that in UBW, Shirou says her won't regret is so he probably won't try to become CG after he fails, which I'm not sure how much that mean after you're dead but at least he won't have to be summoned to fix shit forever. Fate Shirou could still regret it or fuck off to where ever he wants to and try to save people then go to Avalon, and in HF he already exited the game and is living comfy with Sakura.</br>  <br> *Facepalm* <br>Fuck off reddit</br></br>  <br><br>There is nothing that implies that Shirou decides to totally abandon his ideals in HF tho. What I understand from it is that he refuses to follow the path of the cold blooded killer in the name of Justice like Kiritsugu, as we see in the superhero bad end.<br>He still want to save people, but now he doesn't do it just because he wants to follow an ideal, but because he actually has a goal now and that is to protect Sakura. If he abandoned his ideals all together he wouldn't have told Sakura and Rider that he wanted to stop the Ritual to save innocent people as well.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Heaven's feel taught me to hate people who victims of abuse </br></br>    <br>I don't see the connection to the filename</br>  <br> completely ignoring Rin's influence on Shirou <br>She will be with him the entire time to ensure that things go right, this is something Archer didn't have.</br></br>  <br> Most well written <br> such as Sakura <br> Browses /jp/ <br>Every time.</br></br></br></br>  <br> elective <br> trusting the peasants to vote </br></br>  <br> responding to obvious shitposters </br>  <br> responding to people who still believe that UBW or Fate Shirou become Archer </br>  <br>Are you going to take this, UBW fans?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>He's not going to save everyone just because he has Rin. It is still impossible to save every single person.</br>  <br>I swear these bait images get better and better.</br>  <br> responding to people who still believe that UBW or Fate Shirou become Archer <br>Where does it say that?</br></br>  <br><br> Implying Shirou will care about what the Generic Tsundere thinks about his ideal. </br></br>  <br>He doesn't need to save every person, my point is that he will walk the road of a hero like Archer did, but actually surpass him by having no regrets and not being betrayed since he will always have Rin by his side to trust. Nasu even made this even more clear in the notes about the final episode in the UBW adaption.</br>  <br>So what? The entire point of UBW is that he realizes it's impossible, but there's nothing wrong with trying anyway.</br>  Which was the right choice?  Reminder Sakura did nothing wrong.  <br><br>UBW for kids, HF for men.</br></br>  <br>Reminder Sakura did everything wrong</br>  <br><br>Which doesn't contradict anything I've said<br> What? He's talk about the fact that even if he chooses to save everyone, there is fundamentally nothing different between him and Archer given that what they want is impossible. The only difference is that in UBW, Shirou says her won't regret is so he probably won't try to become CG after he fails <br> her won't regret is so he probably won't try to become CG after he fails </br></br></br></br>  <br>HF betters only Shirou and his own. It's the most reasonable route.<br><br>UBW/Fate betters the world at large. They're the most admirable routes.</br></br></br>  <br><br>She was used and manipulated since birth.</br></br>  <br>More like HF for waifufags. Sakura had no likeable qualities and the only reason to actually chase after her was that people self-insert to the idea of giving everything up for their waifu.</br>  <br>And she became the person she was in HF. Just because her past made her into who she is doesn't mean that she's not responsible for her own actions when the entire route hammers in that she was.</br>  <br>Isn't HF for edgy self insert?</br>    <br>Yes, more specifically MoS</br>  <br>Isn't UBW for edgy self insert?</br>    <br>My opinion &gt; Your opinion<br><br>Nice try, tsunderefag.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. UBW is about Shirou following his ideal regardless of how impossible it is, because the act of walking that path is more beautiful to him than anything else. HF is sacrificing absolutely everything for the sake of one girl who doesn't even actively contribute anything while being the problem in question.</br>  <br><br>She was raped, anon. Do you not understand the trauma that does to a woman?</br></br>  <br><br>No.<br>UBW is about following a hollow ideal that will end up breaking him sooner or later.<br>HF is about the final evolution of the ideal which is fighting for a goal and happiness in your life while still fighting for what you believe.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean, it's pretty bad, but it's not like the worst thing in the world.</br>  <br>Sorry but being raped doesn't justify massmurder.<br>Also she wasn't raped in RN, which is what's going to get adapted</br></br>  <br>Yes, but using that as an argument is retarded. "If she wasn't raped and experienced everything she did then she wouldn't have done all that!"<br><br>If she hadn't experienced everything she did then she wouldn't even have been the same fucking character, just have the same genes with an entirely different personality.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Go read the VN again, it was 'all the world's evil' using her negative emotions. She is only but a victim of the circumstances.</br></br>  <br>This one.</br>  <br>His ideal in UBW doesn't end up breaking him unless he detaches himself from everyone and regrets following his path. It's not a hollow ideal, it's an ideal in which even trying to spend your life following it is enough to be treated as an heroic act because of how many are saved through it. <br><br>In HF he's no fighting for what he believes in. In fact he throws away everything he believes in for the sake of adoptiong a new ideal that more conveniently fits the situation, that's literally the exact opposite. Calling it a "final evolution" rather than deconstructing and replacing it entirely is a fucking lie.</br></br></br>  <br>Angra doesn't have a will of it's own.<br>It's all Sakura</br></br>  <br><br>Sakura hated her situation, but that doesn't imply she wanted to kill everyone that is just your assumption.<br>AM amplified all her negative emotions and used all that to bring "all the evil of this world".<br>AM doesn't have an identity, but it does have a purpose and she used Sakura to achieve it.<br>Shirou saw tru all that and decided to believe in her and that is why he stayed with her until the end.<br>It wouldn't make any sense if what you are assuming it's true and she was inherently evil, because then the evolution of Shirou's ideal wouldn't have a meaning and ultimately the novel itself wouldn't have a meaning.﻿</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I suppose Sakura also corrupted the grail.</br>  <br><br>Rape against a woman is one if not the most offensive crimes in the world.<br><br><br><br> Girl gets raped. <br> Never gets any help <br> Is expected to be a full functioning adult <br><br>I don' understand you people.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not using her emotions, it's acting based on her emotions.

Not wanting to go insane, slowly disappear, and be forgot by the people closest to you after pending the last eleven years being beaten raped, and experimented on. While seemingly no one cares, even your sister and lover have other priorities. Also, they're considering trying to kill you.<br><br>Then yes, if you want to.</br></br></br></br>  <br> a few of this could've stopped HF entirely <br>Why didn't Sakura just go to the supermarket?</br></br>  <br>Will Sakura and Shirou kiss?</br>  <br> While seemingly no one cares <br>Shirou doesn't even fucking know. Nobody other than Rin even can care because they don't know anything about the situation.</br></br>  <br>Go to the thread from the other day if you want an explanation of this, unless you're the same person posting the same screenshot/in the thread, then you would know where to go unless you just don't care and want to keep posting this.Which I'm assuming it's that latter because this page doesn't circulate often if at all.</br>  <br>Didn't we already see it in UBW anime? Combination of RN version for the head and penis version for the backside.</br>    <br><br>Except if she doesn't use the power she dies.</br></br>  Medusa has historically been seen as the archetype of the nasty mother, however she is far more complex. She symbolizes the following:<br><br>Sovereign female wisdom. The female mysteries. All the forces of the primordial Great Goddess: The Cycles of Time as past, present and future. The Cycles of Nature as life, death and rebirth. She is universal Creativity and Destruction in eternal Transformation. She is the Guardian of the Thresholds and the Mediatrix between the Realms of heaven, earth and the underworld. She is Mistress of the Beasts. Latent and Active energy.<br><br>Connection to the earth. The union of heaven and earth. She destroys in order to recreate balance. She purifies.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope so. They have to do it every night for a week and a few days, because the nightly encounters are actually integral to Heaven's Feel's story.</br>  <br>The people of that thread have already given a response to your same post too.

Besides, Sakura is highly irrelevant for two of the three routes. How that be the heroine? She's the love interest &amp; one of the villains in one route but nothing for the others.</br></br></br>  <br>How the fuck is she a heroine if she doesn't make any self-sacrifices and is constantly the problem which they have to deal with? Love interest sure but the only heroic act she was going to commit, she didn't even end up doing.</br>  <br>What are you saying? That was my only post in that chain of post.</br>  <br>He's right on about his points, all of them.<br>Sakura's time is finally coming.<br><br>Now, as for your rankings, I would actually put Zero a bit lower, because a lot of stupid shit did happen there.</br></br></br></br>  <br> waifufags <br>That's Fate, saber redeeming quality is only for waifufagging. Who the fuck want unpure waifu like Sakura? Maybe you need to learn what waifufags actually want. They want pure waifu who chase after them. Not the otherwise. Why do you think a lot of people read and watch harem genre?<br> Rin a best, Sakura is 2nd to best. </br></br></br>  <br>This is kind of good.</br>  Anything Ufotable could change in the Heaven's Feel movies to make the route better?<br><br>Maybe add some anime original content, like seeing the ending of Mind of Steel as a what if dream?</br></br>  <br>Maybe that explains Sakura's lack of a role in the other routes. Then again no Zouken in the others either.<br><br>She still chooses to endanger others for her own sake. Luckily she does end up screwing up Zouken too.</br></br></br>  <br>choose between those 2 pics</br>  <br> &gt;we've been holding hands ever since we left the park </br>  <br>I'm claiming that the people in that other thread have already answered your post.

That's worse than Hand Holding.</br>  <br>Rin obviously. Even when she threatens to kill Shirou for his own safety, the Bad End just results in him losing his memory. <br><br>Sakura would kill you for even looking at another girl.</br></br></br>  Is Gilgamesh's power on the level of Types, since Ea has the power to kill Types?  Perfection.    <br><br><br>choose between those 2 pics. which one?</br></br></br>  <br>Ea kills everything, only thing he's lacking is in defense due to being able to die very quickly.</br>   Saber not best Fate waifu with the best route and ending <br><br>/a/ please</br></br>  <br>Even with Angry Manjew she had her influence. Especially in the Femme Fatale bad end.</br>  <br>Sakura will prevail.</br>  <br>Don't listen to this anon, anon. He empathizes with Rin, who happens to not be Sakura, the girl getting her route made in movies, as shown on OP.<br><br>If you know what Sakura went through, she definitely deserves some love, especially in her route.</br></br></br>  <br>She owns a uniform, and a coat is what I chose to believe. No one knows what she's like outside of schools, she doesn't have any personal possessions, and her room is described as looking as if it was decorated for show and she doesn't value anything inside of it.</br>  <br>She's a cardboard cutout<br> boasted as capable and incredibly powerful <br> needs to constantly be taken care of in because beneath her armor she is just a small frightened little girl </br></br></br>  <br>Found it!<br><br> &gt;Shirou calling Saber, Arturia...<br> Sword rests in her sheet <br> talking separated by the sliding door <br> kissing under the moonlight <br> sleeping together in the same futon and handholding under the covers </br></br></br></br> </br></br></br>  <br>After everything she did in HF, she's lost any right to have any love.</br>  <br>I didn't know men were supposed to prioritize a bunch of randoms over the people they love.</br>  <br> Sakura <br>The Extra Sakuras are far better than the real one.</br></br>  If Gilgamesh and Iskander teamed up, could they defeat a 30% Arcueid?  <br>Because she's nerfed as shit with Shirou as her master. She's pretty much an unstoppable juggernaut in life or at her full power with a good master like Rin (which still isn't her full power since she's limited by the class system).</br>  <br>I'm dying here, anon</br>  <br>If Gilgamesh had sex with Saber, will Enkidu be jealous?</br>  <br>Where does Gilgamesh's Strength to be on par with Arcueid come from?</br>  <br>All the more reason to sacrifice yourself to save her.<br>This is a challenge of true love.<br><br>Its real ironic considering Shirou had to throw away his man of steel ideals to choose Sakura, only to have the biggest challenge of heroism on her route.<br>I think that he'd get accepted to become a Heroic Spirit after HF, just because of the strength of his opposition.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank God Ufo didn't adapt Fate route.</br>  <br>Saber's wang.</br>  <br>Vive Sakura</br>  <br>There's a huge difference in scale. Cutting in line with your wife because she's really hungry isn't comparable to letting her go on a murder spree.

It always just seems to be the same shit regurgitated over and over, with instances of trying to ignite waifuwars to keep the thread going. Aren't you guys bored of talking about the same shit over and over?  <br>Reminder that Gilles de Rais or however you spell his name, committed darker acts, but they were counted as heroics, because he was true to his purpose.<br><br>For Shirou, he manages to become the truest to himself in HF, after betraying himself and everyone else prior. That's got to be commendable.<br><br><br>I'm sure he would if people remember him to have two arms, like a normal human.<br><br>In Fate Extra, Saber is a girl only because the system mistaken her memory as that of a female, not a male.<br><br>So back to F S/N, its totally possible that he'll come back with both arms.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there any Servant who would be treated as a Noble Phantasm? If so, does that mean Gilgamesh would have that person in his GOB?</br>  <br> but they were counted as heroics, because he was true to his purpose. <br>Wasn't his summoning an accidental one on account of the corruption? Like, he isn't a "true" heroic spirit.</br></br>  <br>Yeah.</br>  <br> Gilgamesh would have that person in his GOB <br>That would be an amusing thought.</br></br>  <br>Gilles most likely was only able to be summoned due to Angra's summoning in the 3rd war causing non-heroic spirits such as Medusa to be summoned.</br>  <br>Doubt it. Its like saying other best girl Casta got mistakenly summoned as well in F S/N. I mean if they were fake, why do they have "noble phantasms"? I thought these were only handed out to real ones.<br><br><br>Enkidu looks like a hairy dick, or a really hairy head with an odd shoulder.<br><br><br>Its been corrupted for 3 wars now, including the one before F/Z, but who knows. We never seen heroic spirits from the 1st and 2nd war for comparison.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Angra was added in the 3rd, so its effect in summoning only started in the 4th.</br>  <br>Would it have what DEEN made canon, only made better?</br>    Sakura a cute  <br>As expected of tripfags</br>  <br><br>Except one, he went to do something about the situation every night and day, he didn't stay at home with his thumb up his ass. And two, he just didn't want to sacrifice his loved one, which turned out to be the right decision, given SHE wasn't the root cause, the grail was at fault. <br><br>Her death would be a waste, as AM's curse and the tainted grail still exist. It's boggling how after ten years of discussing this route, that simple fact eludes some people. I am almost thinking it's bait, because people can't lack this amount of common sense.<br><br>By that right you should say in UBW he was a terrible person for sacrificing his command seal and risking Rin's life to save Taiga. It's not like he had a plan beyond "give up my command spell and hope Caster doesn't kill us all".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  wormslut a shit and I'm glad she's getting the least attention of the heroines + archer  <br> Her death would be a waste, as AM's curse and the tainted grail still exist. <br>So? Are you stupid the grail can't do shit without Sakura. Kiritsugu already planted bombs and you don't know how bad the dismantling of the grail is ten years later besides speculation.</br></br>  <br>The cuteset</br>  <br> Cu bullied by Medea <br> Cu bullied by Medusa <br>When will Cu stop suffering?</br></br></br>  <br>But Saber and Ilya are the cutest in that picture.</br>  <br> Is next in line to get an adaptation <br> Least attention <br>That goes to the 10 year Tsukihime remake waiting game.<br><br>I thought the many many days of &gt;everyday until you like it, would have reduced the number of actual bullying Rin and Seibah fags.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I still don't like it!</br>  <br> implying wormslut isn't the least popular heroine </br>  <br><br> the least attention out of one of most popular VNs of all time <br> 8th place out of all characters created by the company <br> getting a manga <br><br>Ehh, she gets enough exposure now, and will get more in the future. I think she is fine.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>When he stops being a horny dog.</br></br>  <br>There was a criminal lack of Sakura with Caster scenes in HA. I Also with there were scenes with Archer having Shirou moment when he's around Taiga, Sakura, and old classmates.</br>  <br>Woeeeewwww nice pents breoh!</br>  <br> There was a criminal lack of Sakura with Caster scenes in HA <br>Fucking what? Most of the day scenes in HA were about Sakura and Caster.</br></br>  <br> with <br>as in together</br></br>  <br>What's this supposed to put on the table? That you're a shitposter?<br>If Arthur can come back as a girl, I don't see why Emiya can't come back with both arms.</br></br>  <br> boasted as capable and incredibly powerful <br> needs to constantly be taken care of in because beneath her armor she is just a small frightened little girl <br>Does not follow.<br> She's a cardboard cutout <br>Do you even know what that means? Are Saber antis all this stupid?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Casta lets Sakura call her Onee-sama <br> they don't meet again after that scene <br>fug</br></br></br>  <br><br>So you would kill someone based on a mistake? The grail kills even without the vessel, or did you forget the fire was caused by the vessel being destroyed?<br><br>Kerry had bombs that will go off 50 years in the future, which might I add, will fuck over the monks at Ryuudo Temple due to the cave in. Either way, 50 years is too long<br><br>The only thing you've proven is you could give less of a damn about the citizens or the future of the city, you just want to kill Sakura. Saying 'so' about making someone's sacrifice worthless makes you a pretty terrible guy.<br><br>Also, the dismantling is ten years later, wouldn't the intelligent, preferable scenario be to destroy the greater grail now, and help Sakura, who was forcefully made a part of the system? Something that could be done by coaxing the truth from Ilya?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not their fault Saber's cuteness overpowers their thought process</br>    <br>Because killing Sakura would temporarily stop the killings, then they can go ahead and dismantle it. That was Shirou's whole dilemma anyways.</br>  <br>Post more cute Sakuras</br>  <br><br>And you could dismantle the grail, which would cut the taint from corrupting Sakura, which stops both things. Didn't you pay attention?<br><br>That is like killing the guy being shot instead of the shooter and saying you saved the victim by killing him. Which is so silly I don't know where to begin.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because killing Sakura would most likely be a lot quicker than dismantling the grail.</br>    <br>Because you can't dismantle the fucking grail in a day.</br>    <br>There's no mistake killing her would stop the killings all the same. Destroying the grail requires a powerful nuke or Illya's cooperation. Woohoo I am a terrible person for talking facts about the fate of a fictional character sue me.</br>    <br>The one that can actually Kill Gilgamesh</br>  <br>Why do you keep arguing about something that required the whole route for them to figure out? The deaths already happened by then.</br>        <br>Why are Sakurafags so insufferable? I don't even hate the character herself, but her fans are worse than Rinfags and Saberfags.</br>  So, what will ufotable do with  Tohsaka's Anus ?  <br><br>Well firstly, I would think blowing the thing up is faster than dismantling it. Which is possible.<br><br>Again, you are saying to kill her, which you can't take back, when you could blow up the magic circle of Justeaze's body. Which ends everything. Something that takes maybe an hour, if that if they use Rider, it'd be a matter of minutes. If Ilya spills the beans about the grail system earlier on, we can use Saber.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Rinfags are easily the worst.</br>  Since the other thread is filled with shitposting.<br><br>The aragami designs were accurate to the game. The CGI for them is noticeably different compared to the characters.<br><br>The shadowy thing on top of the rubble looked like the first "boss" from the game.<br><br>The training room was the tutorial room.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why isn't episode 0 subbed since the 720p raws are out?

The fact that these production credits only appear on the site and not on the episode might be a show of embarrassment.</br>  <br>It's just the 2011 OVA + staff talk show.<br><br><br> I think they have an exclusive contract. <br>Anime Consortium Japan which is running Daisuki is on the production committee.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that random teddy bear in the middle of the webm </br>  <br>We already have this thread you fucking /v/ermin retard.

How did Utsugi take off his jacket?</br>  <br>It was shit.<br><br><br> That's the one filled with shitposts. <br>Because its shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not sure how to feel about the show yet. Maybe because I haven't played the game.<br><br>I already have a feeling that either the Branch Director or Lindow will turn into the big bad, though. Both of them have that traitor vibe.</br></br></br></br>    <br> That's the one filled with shitposts. <br> If they don't praise the show they must be shitposting! </br></br>  <br>You can not praise the show and it still wouldn't be as bad as that thread. Don't be delusional.</br>  A pretty decent first episode, these CGI artstyle(?) is starting to grow on me, it looks way better than SIdonia at least.<br><br>Unfortunately, I can already see people calling it fujoshit anime if it does well like Kekkai.</br></br>  <br>NNB is shit<br>Euphonium is shit<br>GE isn't shit<br>Because it isn't boring</br></br></br></br>  <br> it isn't boring <br>But it is.</br></br>  I wonder if she masturbates with machine oil.  <br> Bringing up two completely unrelated shows <br><br>IRC at full force for this show, I see.</br></br></br>  <br> Anime this shit doing well. </br>  is this burst or not ?  <br> if it does well <br>Not going to happen so don't worry.</br></br>  <br>Lindow dies like a bitch early on.</br>  <br><br>I remember people telling me this when AOT and Free aired too. Screencapped just in case</br></br>  I think it looked pretty good for CG. It's good enough that I didn't feel like dropping it in the middle of the episode. I'll actually stick with it unlike all the other previous CG shows.  <br> Non Non Biyori <br> Working!!! <br> Trouble darkness <br> Moster girls <br>I would be really surprised if this show ends up selling well.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Every post get redirected to /v/,MAL and reddit <br> Not shitposting <br>Nice try shitposter-kun but anyone with half a brain will see that the other thread went to shit.<br>Nobody is discussing the show since everyone is too busy trying to frame the other as a /v/ermine.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I found that surprisingly enjoyable. I don't really know anything about the show though so I assume it will go to shit.</br>  <br> Unfortunately, I can already see people calling it fujoshit anime if it does well like Kekkai. <br>Nah, that kind of shitposter is being distracted by gangsta.</br></br>  <br>Everybody saw SnK selling, it was obvious as hell.<br>Good thing Japan hates God Eater as well.</br></br>  <br>That's because it isn't primarily CG but mostly hand drawn with extremely heavy filtering. If you pay attention you will spot the difference.</br>  <br> It's just the 2011 OVA + staff talk show. <br>Right but the only available sub I've seen is like 320p. Surely someone would've slapped subs on the 720p version by now.</br></br>  <br>The hell is going on with his collarbones?</br>  <br/>  <br>I'll take it. It looks mostly good for enough of the anime that I don't hate it.</br>  Pretty sure this is what the leader was.  <br>The show isn't entirely CGI like Sidonia.</br>  <br>For some reason they seem to have decided to take hand drawn and get close to the look of the game using post-processing rather than just using CG. Maybe because you can get better animation from hand drawn. At least that is what I think from watching it and looking at the credits there are tons more normal animators credited with working on the episode than CGI artists so they must have been drawing something. The monsters seemed entirely CG though.</br>  <br> Japan hates God Eater as well. <br><br>Sauce: My ass</br></br></br>  <br> m-muh MANime </br>   B-but muh 2D anime <br>I have no problem watching this since I wanted to play the games, but kinda forgot about them</br>  <br> show with brown prostitutes and actual onscreen sex <br> fujoshit <br>you fucking wot m8, at least call Aoharu fujoshit</br></br></br>  <br>Not same anon but if I get bored to death with those anime then i'm <br> muh MANime?  <br><br>KyoAni shitposters need to die</br></br></br></br>  <br>The show has 2 sexy men as the lead. You know the Fujoshi will be all over that.</br>  <br> This is what shitposters actually think </br>   fake sales fags don't realize bamcos doing the exact same distribution strategy Cinderella girls did. For God Eater as well.  <br><br>Sure must be nice having the best competitive advantage in terms of publishers</br></br>  It kinda looks like they're trying to copy the techniques used in Kotonowa no Niwa along with some sort of filter and lots of shading to try and get it to look closer to the game, characters and weapons are definitely not CG but the backgrounds and aragami definitey are ,anime has had CG backgrounds for years now, look at almost any seasonal action anime and "dynamic" scenes, even Pokemon uses it now.<br><br>Still, it's a game adaptation so it's probably going to end up being trash.</br></br>  <br><br> Thinking the characters are CG <br><br>It's like you faggots have never seen shading before</br></br></br></br>    <br> thumb placement <br>So, I'm wondering how they go through all this work with multiple levels of shading and still nobody manages to realize her hand is on backwards.</br></br>  <br>Just you wait until you're looking at sadpanda one day and then you see those two shirtless on the cover of a doujin all about them fucking each other complete with silly hand motions.</br>  <br>nigga you can have shading without making them look like shit</br>  <br><br>It's not. That's just shittily drawn perspective on that hand</br></br>  <br>UFOTABLE IS FINISHED</br>  <br> He thinks because cowtit prostitute is in it it's not fujoshit <br>Two bishounen buff leads who take up a majority of the screen time, noticeable female audience.<br><br>Gotta keep in mind this is Japan we're talking about, not Tumblr landwhales(and even then they like it.)</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know about the new season but I remember Crowds was pretty Fujoshi</br>  <br>Only autists care about that. It's a fucking minor mistake and you fucking know it. <br><br>Bothers you so much? buy BDs.</br></br></br>  <br>Crowds is omnipandering but Sugane is gay as fuck for Joe, and this season they amped it up</br>  <br>The only one suitably Fujoshi-bait in that is Joe, and he barely gets any screentime anyway. That show as a whole went pretty unnoticed, but there were a few Hajime doujins.<br><br>Gangsta has 2 sexy male leads with all the screentime. That makes a big difference.</br></br></br>  <br>The point is it's still not CG you blind faggots.</br>  <br> Only autists care about that. It's a fucking minor mistake and you fucking know it. </br>  <br><br><br>Literally every studio draws perspective shittily at some point. Modern anime scheduling means you get 1 shot to get it right, if not you have to move on and suck it up.</br></br></br>   gameplay is some monhun ripoff <br> game story is evangelion ripoff <br> anime made to be SnK ripoff because that got popular <br>Amazing.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That's the connective tissue from her wrist to her hand.<br><br>The placement is fine.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>God eater predates AoT by one year, but nice try</br></br>   next ep probably   Is this CG?  <br>Does it matter? All that should matter is if you like it, regardless of the production.</br>  <br>What is the shadow framing his face even? If I didn't know better I'd mistake it for lazily drawn stubble. Same for  as well.</br>  <br>I get they had a hard-on for 5-tone shading, but you can do it without it looking like CG. Just fix your coloring.</br>  <br>No. Shading.<br><br>Anyways, this <br>But faggots like you can't decide wheter they like something unless someone else tells them. <br><br>I like it by the way, not sure about the story</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does it matter what, dumblord? Or do you think I'm asking "Is this CG? If yes then I'll drop it." or what?</br>    Is it more or does Sidonia actually look better than the stylized 3dcg of God Eater?<br><br>I can't put my finger on it but there's something just wrong about it.</br></br>   **1,141位/**1,045位 (***,155 pt) [*,**0予約] 2015/10/29 GOD EATER / ゴッドイーター vol.1 (特装限定版) [Blu-ray] <br>UFOTABLE found a way!</br>  <br>to fuck up a show</br>  <br>Ufotable is the new shaft, they can only milk one franchise.</br>  <br>Jesus.

Tsukihime is huge in Japan</br></br></br>  The shoddy attempt at making 2D characters look CGI-like with that weird shading only makes them look like cardboard cut-outs layered on the backgrounds. <br><br>Disgusting.</br></br>  <br> Streaming <br/></br>  <br>Are you blind?</br>  same problem as the game where the monster designs are just dumb and boring  <br>Streaming looks better than that</br>  <br><br>now post the game bundle</br></br>  I find this funny.<br><br> 4chan: GE is shit because UFO a shit and they trying to make 2d looks like 3d is fucking autism. <br> Nip: Give muh Yuu back, you fucking retard UFO. <br><br>Can't decie which is more hilarious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that the one with God Eater Resurrection?</br>  I don't get it.

I didn't like the animation at all tbh  <br><br>how the fuck do you read these bluray sales postings?</br></br>  <br/>  <br> tbh <br><br>Fuck off back to /sp/ or /tv/ you dumbfuck faggot.</br></br></br>  <br> Dropped before even the download is complete. <br>fuck off</br></br>  <br><br>been here since 2008 and i still can't read them. I'm not stupid either, physics grad student</br></br>  <br>Main factor that would compel me to watch this show would be cute girls.<br><br><br>There are none. On top of this shitty style of 3d animation.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What's the general consensus on it been? Has 2chan said anything major about it?</br>  <br>-studio made few popular titles that sold a lot and have big fanbase and hatebase<br>-it's videogame<br>-artstyle makes newfags think that whole anime is made in CGI<br>-IRCshits are bored<br>-nothing else aired today<br>-it's last of non-sequel anime premiering this summer<br>-it's weekend</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>pretty rude<br><br>tbh</br></br></br>  <br>to put it in perspective, it'll probably do worse than Teekyuu</br>  <br>/v/ermin go fuck yourself we already have a thread </br>  <br>NO ONE HERE GIVES A SHIT IF YOU ARE HONEST OR NOT, YOU ANONYMOUS RETARD</br>  <br> new rank/previous rank (Number of preorders) <br>Anyway<br> Phy grad student <br><br>What the fuck are you doing here.

They made something horrible and you wonder why people are shitting about It?</br>  <br><br> no one still has posted the anime bundle that comes with Resurrection <br><br>nice shitposting</br></br></br></br>  So, do the Japs hate it? Preorder ranking is pretty shitty but Nico rating seems more decent than most of the animu this season.  <br>wew lad</br>  <br>   Number of preorders <br>wrong, nobody knows the exact number of preorders, those are just "points"</br></br>  <br> &gt;**1,141位/**1,045位 <br><br>my sides</br></br></br>  <br>Not even top100<br>Not even top1000<br><br>Why so people reply to this bait?</br></br></br></br>  How much of a bro does this guy end up?  <br>2chan is just shitposting as usual nothing news. <br><br>And about Yuu, it's just that Nip seems butthurt about him got replaced by Eyebrows for quit sometimes. It seems that in Nip there are shit tons of official manga and novel that ship YuuxArisa so UFO repleced him make them feels like a cuck.<br><br>It's really funny if you ask me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because it's being bundled with the videogame, same with idolmaster</br>  <br>pretty rude why are you mad on the internet???</br>  <br>Damn those armpits are to die for.<br>Best girl confirmed.</br></br>  Namco Bandai just wanted to boost the game sales, don't they?  <br>Kill yourself, cancer.

Shingeki no bahamut confirmed the best and only decent video game adaptation. Ufoshits better go back to fate.<br><br> Not that I give a shit about the source </br></br>  <br>Why is the quality so horrible?<br><br>What the fuck. Its like streaming quality.</br></br></br>  <br>Seek help.</br>  <br>But Fate/UBW is technically a video game adaption.<br> It has interaction albeit being a game </br></br>  <br>Bahamut isn't videogame but browser card game</br>  Why did they use the shittier design?  <br>You mean Idolmaster.</br>  This MC looks way more generic than Yuu. <br><br>I haven't played the game so I'm not butthurt or anything, it's just that this one's design reminds me of the faggot from Shingeki no Vampire we had last season and also Eren of course, a glance and my brain shouts "this dude looks like a fucking edgelord" <br><br>Yuu's design doesn't look like an edgelord</br></br></br></br>  <br>Should have gone with girl MC for the miniskirt, ZR and the form fitting dress that outlines her tits.</br>  <br>That's a screenshot of a webm you fucking retard.</br>  I'll bet Ufotable wishes they never accepted this project, soon at least  <br>jesus, that everything <br><br> <br>go fuck yourself cancer, can't you do anything right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Different game</br>  <br>whats the nico rating look like?</br>  After seeing the first episode it baffles me how people on /a/ think this is entirely CG.  Gangsta and this are AOTS/10  <br>60% totemo yokata.<br>Everything this season has similarly shit ratings other than Ushio to Tora.</br></br>  <br>That's unfortunate, I'm saddened.<br><br><br>You must be new here.</br></br></br></br>    Which is worse?  <br>Shitposting retards.</br>  <br>It's a meme, ya dip.</br>  <br><br>Says everything about how shit this season is really</br></br>  <br>More like  this guy's shit taste. <br><br>Not sure if neo-/a/ is behind it, but I wouldn't be surprised.</br></br></br>  And with this, my watchlist for this season is now dumped down to only one which is Arslan Senki from last season.<br>This season is so fucking shit.</br>  <br>Do you have a blog? I don't fucking care.</br>  <br> this new <br><br><br> some garbage made of almost full CG is just a meme  <br><br>Jesus Christ I hate reddit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>you are both fucking faggot, if you think that either this or gangsta was shit. Maybe they'll turn shit, but the first episode of both was promising.</br></br>  This is just a parody right? Like Ninja Slayer?<br><br> Even though Ninja Slayer is actually fucking good </br></br>  <br>Who asked you to care?</br>  <br>I agree with you, even though I don't like your blogging. <br><br>Also post in the actual thread <br>some /v/ermin retard made this one</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>better than I expected but pretty fucking awful for something UFOtable fans to turn on</br></br>  Meanwhile Fate/Shit 2nd disc box is bombing.

It's faster paced though, had fun with it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Make an original story set in the same universe following some cute hunter who aspires to be as good of a hunter as the one that saved her village from a rampaging elder dragon. Along the way, she learns the value of friendship and how to use rage as fuel for her journey as she paves her path toward G rank with the blood of her quarries.</br>  The artstyle looks nice, faggots. When a videogame like Okami comes out everyone praises the art but this comes out and people shit on it. Why? It's clearly intentional.   More reprises of God and Man <br>Not even mad about the MC, just keep on delivering with the music.</br>  Ufo fags on suicide watch  <br> cute hunter who aspires to be as good of a hunter </br>  That was really good, but the lack of Alisa is worrying.<br>She's barely in the OP. Why the fuck do they think we're even watching this?</br>  <br>Why? I'm a ufofag and I liked it.<br>Keep trying to force the meme of it beign shit, though</br></br>  <br>It's because she's so awful she can't bring herself to kill popos, because they're "cute."</br>  <br>JUST DO IT</br>  <br>SUDDELY APEX TIGREX</br>  <br>but I like Hibike</br>  <br> Everybody saw SnK selling, it was obvious as hell. <br> Good thing Japan hates God Eater as well. <br>Rage Burst 2 sold really well.

Stay mad.</br>  So can I skip this shit or not?  if you an chose the another anme studio foe this who woul you chose?  this was really pretty shit mates  <br><br>madhouse</br></br>  <br>yeah, it's not worth bothering imo tbh</br>  I liked ,but need more of best girl   Kanon    <br>Capcom dosent have the money for that.</br>  <br>Is it okay if I masturbate to her?</br>  When will nips stop saying "Goddo"? "Gaud" or "Goud" would be closer to the correct pronunciation...   watching Shit Eater   <br> imo <br> tbh <br>I don't think he wanted any opinions from dumb normies like you.</br></br></br>  <br>This. Needs more Kanon, and Second Unit in general.</br>  <br>This is the shittier one though</br>  <br><br>so epic</br></br>  <br>tbh that was uncalled for</br>   a minute and 13 seconds in <br><br>What the fuck is this shit?</br></br>  <br>ur being rly rude right now dude</br>  <br>Wit</br>  But Lenka is a girl's name.  <br><br>tbh you must be new imo, if you don't know why tbh you are</br></br>  <br>So much for an exciting start to literally the only full show on Sundays this season. Well, there are things to talk about with the direction, in a number of ways. As I mentioned in the season preview, the style is… a little weird. It almost looks like rotoscoped CGI honestly. People don’t move like the puppets of Sidonia though, so I’m sticking with my assumption that they’re trying to make the regular art/animation look like CGI so that all the CGI they wanted to use wouldn’t stand out as badly. They don’t exactly succeed on that front. The other thing it absolutely adores doing is the slow mo reaction followed by a zip. It also uses silence surprisingly decently, especially when it comes to having the quiet protagonist stay quiet, even in his head and not fill every available space with blathering or weird music.<br><br>That doesn’t change that there just wasn’t much going on in the episode and because of that, it was very dull. He bonked a couple monsters in the holoshed, got bonked back, and that was the entirety of the action before The A*Team showed up at the end. Even they didn’t make themselves very interesting. They’re so cool and in control that they just casually backhand a few monsters as they walk along, leaving the protagonist to summon up his hidden gun transforming powers to actually put in some effort and save Random Woman #74. The end. I feel like we could’ve begun the episode at about the 17 minute mark and missed nothing but some exposition about how it’s magic science and weird shots from the cleavage PoV.</br></br></br>  <br>would have been if it wasn't so pretentious and predictable</br>  <br>Thanks I worked hard on that meme</br>  <br><br>We quoting reddit now? Please...</br></br>  <br>You fucking retard. MH is Capcom's property. GE is Bandai Namco.<br>Bandai Namco employed Ufotable to make anime, they are paying and getting revenues. Animation studios don't pick up things to animate by themselves.</br></br>  <br> ... </br>  <br>Maybe it's because I've been watching the 3rd season of Hannibal but I think they could pull back on the amount of slow motion scenes. It's nitpicky though.</br>  <br>Not with that filename</br>  <br><br>it's your new CGI-2D overlord, Ufotable once again innovating and showing how they're 20 years ahead of everyone.</br></br>  <br>it almost feels like they just want to drag it out with this kind of slo-mo. Nigga you're not even fighting right now, stop going slo-mo</br>  This is why I can't stand this place sometimes.<br><br>I think this forum concept about being anonymous is great but people use it as excuse to shitpost...<br><br>Everyone who want a serious discussion is welcome: https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comm<wbr>ents/3d0kz8/spoilers_god_eater_epis<wbr>ode_1_discussion/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Emphasizes the movement he does to show you he's fast.</br>  <br>it would be faster if they just let him go full sonic the entire way</br>  Great opening episode. I forgot ufotable was doing this; the animation and production values are great. Good direction too.<br><br>Overall I'm excited for this.</br></br>    Maybe that's because I'm sleepy but evertything feelt slow as fuck and I don't mean slow-mo scenes: the dialogues and characters interactions, the way everyone reacts to something, even the battles  <br>Summer is real</br>  <br>That would just show him being fast. They specifically showed his veins/nerves pop out and turn red, which I'm guessing signifies the power of the bracelet activating. They also did that effect with the God Arc lighting up before it transformed. They want to emphasize that he's fast, but also that he was activating something</br>  Is Alisa and Kota a oficial pairing.In the first game Alisa is tsundere for kota.  <br>confirmed for cancer</br>  <br> Forum <br> ... <br> Reddit </br></br></br>  <br>So is IRC.</br>  <br> top rated post <br>oh my fucking god you cannot be serious</br></br>  I also love the art style. I haven't seen a more visual appealing style like that in some time.  I was planning to just drop it and forget this shit show with horrible visuals, but seeing the horrible fanbase, now i feel it's my duty towards the board to shitpost every thread i see until we drive the 9 retards that actually like this shit into reddit or wherever you came from, possibly tumblr too, same as with space dandy.  <br>Keep up the good fight kid</br>  <br>nice meme<br><br>no one cares</br></br></br>  <br> People can't like what I dislike <br>You need to be 18 to post here</br></br>  <br>Actually I always imagined the MC in the game was more the silent type like from Persona but the anime gave the MC the Eren personality from AoT.</br>  <br><br> this easily baited  <br><br>heh, /v/ermins</br></br></br></br>  <br>I mentioned it being a meme for a reason.</br>  <br>rude lol</br>  Embarrassing, baffles me how ufotablefags still defend this show full of cgi.<br><br>This episode pretty much confirm that KyoAni deliver the best animation anytime anywhere</br></br>  <br>lol got em</br>  <br>IRC is a myth.</br>  <br><br> this easily baited <br>At least try to make it hard /v/ermin, the faggots from /co/ may be sjw fujos but they recognize easy baiting.</br></br></br>  <br>of course</br>  <br>hell fucking wierd, i re-started playing god eater after years and after watching the opening scene immediately thought hell, it would be great if they made an anime out of it and also thought ther ewill be people saying its copy of shingeki<br>this made me happy<br><br><br>CGI?...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ufos already committed sudoku</br>  <br>fatefags and ufofags are on deadwatch</br>     there are people so retarded they defend this redditor garbage show <br>Truly weird times</br>  <br> /a/ is studio wars now. <br>Please stop this</br></br>  <br>I haven't even watched this show or played this game, I'm just funposting</br>   CGI shit <br> SnK storyline <br> this MC <br> this artstyle <br> I expected nothing and i'm still let down <br><br>I'm out.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kyoani <br> in charge of anything but boring shit <br>Who cares about the animation if it's wasted on boring crap?<br>Also, GE isn't CGI except for the aragami. <br><br> I was just pretending to be retarded <br>Fuck off</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For the last time: CGI is only for the aragami. This is getting shitposted to hell and back because everyone forgot about the best girl, so careful.</br>  I think I'm better off making a thread on /v/ about the anime  <br>the thumb is on the other side, its just a shadow</br>  <br>Yes, the horrible quality is blatant. Besides a good fighting scene that is the only good thing Ufo can do, it's pretty mediocre. <br><br>but then reddit/mal is all over here saying "I liked It", "different artstyle, you just don't get It" what makes things even more embarrassing.</br></br></br>  <br> now <br>Lurk more kid, What was the kyoani/shaft divide of 2012?<br>This is more of a fanbase thing though, i find this show as cancerous as its fanbase.</br></br></br>  This is the worst MC I've had the misfortune of experiencing recently. So many non-character pieces of shit lately. It's like they can just throw pieces of cardboard in and sell it now.  <br>People like stuff, yes<br> redditor garbage <br>what the fuck does that even mean? Are you so desperate you have to resort to the reddit boogeyman?</br></br></br>  Remember to report shitposters. Looks like their awful thread died so they are migrating to this one.  <br>Yes please, also stay there.</br>  <br>MAL hates it and calls it CGI</br>  Can someone give a straight answer as to why the art style is supposedly horrible?<br><br>I haven't played the game and don't play much vidya at all, so I wouldn't know. I thought it looked great.</br></br>   human weapons called God Eater <br> GOD eater <br>why is Japan so fucking edgy?</br></br>  <br> People who like what I dislike are from MAL and Reddit <br>Why can't you accept people liking things you don't?</br></br>  <br>oh thanks god, although, i dont think CGI isnt neccesarrly bad, i think its a good choice they made aragami with it, they are so complex they would end up just simplfying it or showing them very rarely if they were to draw it</br>  <br>You are the cancer /v/ermin who created this thread, huh?<br><br>You do realize that this show is garbage and people are shitposting here since the beginning of the thread right?</br></br></br>  just finished watching it, art style is fine if not great<br><br>but holy shit, lay off the slo-mo would you?</br></br>  <br>Why can't you accept people with solid opinion who have been here longer than you disliking things you like?</br>  <br> i am so new i believe i can fight the funpolice <br>Give up, the autists have marked this as a crossboarder friendly show and will proceed to push all discussion out.

I really want to know what this semen demon is up to  <br><br>As we were shown, eating pizza and reacting to newspapers.</br></br>  <br>This, though he's probaly grateful Doflamingo did kill his dad on some level.</br>  Yea, Drake's kind of a badass like that. He stopped Urouge and Killer from going nuts too. He seems like a calm, mature, cool-headed person. Which will all change once Luffy arrives.  <br>yeah, but what is her agenda, goal or plan? hiding from the marines forever?</br>  <br>taking advantage of being a loli like usually</br>  <br>Perhaps trying to find a way to reform her crew.</br>  <br>We know that she is without a crew at the moment and lives like a hobo, thats it.</br>  <br><br> I'm calm and mature and cool-headed guys, I definitely won't underestimate the SH <br> where have we heard this before <br> turns into a T-Rex and goes ape-shit <br> Gets Konged </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Drake will fight Luffy <br>Why do I have such a hard time picturing this ? Drake seems like honorary nakama material to me, same as Law.</br></br>  can't wait for the moment Enel fucks Luffy and Kidd's fight up by electrocuting the latter through the shitton of metal things he uses as his arm just because.<br><br> just kidding, I don't think that's going to happen, it may just be the case if Luffy were about to be horribly defeated </br></br>  Nevermind that, can I find a 793 translation that's not dogshit?  <br><br>I get the feeling Drake is going to get Law'd pretty hard when the time comes</br></br>  I am already looking forward to Luffys reaction when he sees the dinosaur  <br><br>I know, it was just the King Kong vs T-Rex/Godzilla etc. thing I was thinking of.</br></br>  <br>I think Drake would just pet Chopper and smile like the cute he is in this situation.</br>  <br> Drake learned how to use Awakened version of his fruit, becomes Godzilla for Kong Luffy to fight </br>  <br>Nah, the most mature character is a giraffe zoan.</br>  Why commissioner Gordon fights crime?  <br>But awakened Zoans make you look like a retard</br>  <br> Kidd alliance attacks Shanks.  <br> Everyone of the alliance is wiped out, fodder from the other side. Only Kidd is left <br> Kidd gathers all the weapons lying on the ground for a final desperate attack <br> Fuckin' Vari out of nowhere. <br>Turns out, Enel came back down and joined Shanks.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That makes a lot of sense. And in Wano it makes even more sense, I think you are on to something, even without Godzilla awakening. Oda should make Luffy fight someone from his own generation already. And seeing how Kaidou is on sight, and Drake is working under him, it all makes sense. <br><br>Now I'm really hyped.</br></br></br>  <br>It's better than fighting  your grammar. </br>  <br>But Kid's gonna use Enel as an electromagnetic weapon/pet.</br>  <br>I see, but if the GCPD is in big part responsible for the city's state then he has no right to do it.</br>  <br>Your only option is Viz and manga stream.</br>  Will Law stick with the Strawhats until they take down Kaido? Or will they split ways until it's time for the next phase of the plan?  <br>Enel won't join anyone, he is going to take over Urogue's crew and be a pirate captain.</br>  <br>Because he wants to share his meat with everyone.</br>  <br/>  <br>Because the dynamic duo are useless.</br>  <br>They'll won't be in Wano but they will be when the time is nigh.</br>  <br>My point is: Fujitora is wrong.</br>  <br>What gives a human rights to fight crimes? Being called hypocrite (he's not a hypocrite, mind you) is better than playing blind.</br>  <br>yes, Laws crew is on Wano and Kaidou is pissed at Law now</br>  <br>Akainu is more wrong.</br>  <br>Law's crew in on Zou. And it doesn't look Kaido is on Wano.</br>  <br>Of course. Fujitora is still wrong though.</br>  <br>What should he do?</br>  <br>His job.</br>  Alright gentlemen<br><br>How do we kill the Red Dog marine man?</br></br>  <br><br>shes with the revolutionaries</br></br>  <br>That's wrong.</br>    Guys what do you think about matchup in Red hairs vs Kidd alliance. My guesses are:<br> Kidd vs Shanks (captain vs captain) <br> Killer vs Beckhman (vice captain vs vice captain) <br> Basil vs Lucky Roo (2 guys based on luck) <br>And i suppose Apoo vs Yasopp<br><br>I would also like to add that I think that Kidd has actually a chance to win this fight. I know that Killer is not reckless as his captain so I think they have a decent plan. The problem comes with after controlling territory after fight.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Drake is going to get Law'd <br>I want this</br></br>  <br>Suffocate him using Barto's barrier.</br>  He does look pretty terrible in orange<br><br>Then again, everyone did <br><br>I'm convinced Law designed those jumpsuits so he'd look hotter in comparison. But after a while even he couldn't stand it, and switched everyone to black.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then to my point, Gordon is doing wrong because GCPD is corrupt. <br><br>You can't just shrug off your duties because someone somewhere in your position or higher is doing things wrong. What organization is 100% guilt free?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>did you actually draw out that idea?  I like you <br><br>Did you try white? Only Bepo is orange iirc</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The wrong one is some part of the Marine itself, not Fujitora nor the Marine as a whole. By shrugging the corrupted duties he refuse to be that part.</br>  Would you pay her 100,000B?  <br>What corrupted duties?</br>  <br>Playing hero and covering the corrupted part of the Marines.</br>  <br>I'm glad people who do good don't waste time trying to figure out the science behind it. Gordon fights crime because people need help. He worries about his organization's complicity in the situation after people are safe. Fujitora knows that by repeating the events of Alabasta (the government claims responsibility for saving a place that fell victim to a pirate they employed in the first place) nothing would change and the shichibukai would continue to wreak havoc on citizens. By doing nothing now, he's hoping to destabilize the shichibukai system. He's the only one doing anything right in the government. Save the argument to obligation.</br>    <br>His plan was to bow down and make a public apology, can't he do that after doing his job? No, let vigilantes do it.<br><br><br>No need to cover anything, Akainu or the WG would cover AFTER his report. Everything was in his hands.</br></br></br></br>  <br>that's actually not too bad. Hat could be a different color but I can totally see it now.</br>  <br><br>This, unfortunately.<br><br>As far as we know she's done jack shit during TS but escape and steal pizza.</br></br></br></br>  <br>very kubo</br>  <br>And read the news, pay attention.</br>  <br>If we're talking about sticking my penis into her, she would just steal my money and leave if she didn't want to do it.</br>  <br>I am so ready for X-Drake to rip someone's fucking head off.<br>I respect the simplicity of his fighting style.<br>Become T-Rex, remove head.</br></br></br>  <br> They keep asking him to turn into a dinosaur while Franky's robot coolness gets ignored </br>  <br> His plan was to bow down and make a public apology, can't he do that after doing his job? <br>No, he can't do it after doing his job, because A) doing his job would defeat his purpose and B) it needed to be done on camera so the government wouldn't have time to spin the story and make themselves look good.</br></br>  <br>Unless his father was a piece of shit he is just apathetic.</br>  <br>Which dinobots are we talking, though? <br><br>The mentally retarded G1 ones, the intelligent Dreamwave, or the IDW ones who were smart but then shockwave fucked them stupid?</br></br></br>  <br>So he can't do his job and say sorry because it was their fault? It was his camera.</br>  everyday until you like it  Is any female ever gonna be a hostile threat again?<br><br>All of them always end up joining the rubber cock alliance.<br><br>Big mum don't count tho</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm convinced Law designed those jumpsuits so he'd look hotter in comparison <br>Ah.<br><br>But he was?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because he knows if he repoeted first the corrupted system will be covered and continued. It's needed to fix that system.</br>  <br>I just find the idea that drake defected from the marines after finding a cash of ancient zoans appealing.<br>Until we see his underlings in a fight my silly headcanon cannot be refuted.<br><br>I like to post it as a joke in threads so...whichever dinobots you like.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We met his father in the Corazon flashback</br>  <br> Big mum don't count tho <br>Yes she does.</br></br>  <br> So 100k for a look. <br> How much do you want for "That"? <br>And this is how Nami became a Queen.</br></br></br>  <br>Marvel UK intelligent Dinobots</br>  <br>From Sakazuki's call we all know the report was in Fujitora's control.</br>  <br> &gt;..whichever dinobots you like. <br><br>I like the IDW ones <br>They're the most fucked up. <br>Grimlock got mindfucked so much he's hanging out with a bunch of failure decepticons who scrounge for energy at backwater planets. <br><br><br>Also a great choice. Any version of Grimlock that goes to great lengths to piss off Prowl is a good Grimlock.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Will we ever see Gin again?  Some post that interview with Oda about Drake origin. Then post yfw he joins Luffy's alliance.    <br>I don't think I understand exactly what we're arguing here. What is it you think Fuji did and what is it you think he should have done?</br>  <br>I know, fucking hypocrite. Corruption apologist.</br>  <br>What interview?</br>  Daily reminder that Law a slut.  <br>Drake is on a collision course with Luffy/Law now.<br>Something big will happen that's for sure.<br><br>I think the issue is we know very little of Drake's motives.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's probably Mexican, so a police officer fighting crime an unusual sight.</br>  <br>The report is. The covering isn't, if he didn't control the report by not reporting first.</br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!<br><br><br>Penguin will support his captain regardless. <br> <br>But just remember that Shachi is pure. </br> </br></br></br></br>  <br> Luffy establishes some sort of alliance with Drake <br> They need to go somewhere stat <br> Luffy grabs Drakes shoulder expecting him to give him a dinosaur ride there.  <br> Drake does the Chopper-on-head-Law-face.  <br>Oda, pls</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;They keep asking him to turn into a dinosau <br><br> &gt;They keep asking him to turn into a dinosaur <br><br> &gt;Luffy grabs Drakes shoulder expecting him to give him a dinosaur ride there. <br><br>Holy fucking shit.<br>Confirmed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Since from what I know about Shank's crew, which is very little, all of them predominantly fight with weapons, which Kid can remove from the equation by using his DF to take all of them away. But then comes the problem of Shank's absolutely godlike Haki. If they can somehow find a way to get past that, then I think they have a shot.<br><br>The only real way I can see Kid's alliance winning is if they pull some kind of sneaky, underhanded shit</br></br></br>  <br>Birdtits didn't jump on the rubber cock.</br>  <br>I am saying that you can't shrug off your job because someone, on your level or higher is doing things wrong. Fujitora let vigilantes handle the situation because in his view he had not the right to do anything and that is bullshit.<br><br><br>I am saying he should report first then apologize?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Fujitora's looking boss as fuck right now. All this talk from characters about how Akainu is bullshit and an asshole, and only Fujitora's had the balls to straight show how fucked his form of 'Justice' actually is to the world. No boasting, no fighting, just 'yeah the Marines fucked up bad.' And Akainu's so fucking butthurt about it. Delicious.</br></br>  <br>Please Oda</br>  <br>Baby 5 jumped all over fat monkey cock<br>what a fucking travesty</br></br>  <br>Yes she did. She jumped on him and decided to give him a nice cool hug</br>  <br>Fujitora is complicit in the Marine failure in Dressrosa.</br>  <br>You implied he should report here: No need to cover anything, Akainu or the WG would cover AFTER his report. Everything was in his hands.</br>  <br>To give Akainu a little credit.<br><br>This isn't so much about absolute justice as it is about letting shichibukai get away with murder.<br>It also could be said to be a knock against the celestial dragon's rule, though Akainu has also railed against that a little himself.<br><br>The angle of marine/government coverups can be laid squarely at Akainu's feet though, since it looks like that's what he would have done.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, never again, not now that Oda fully bloomed as a white knight.<br>Women will never win a single fight in One Piece from now on, and they'll always prevent the male characters from fucking their shit up by conveniently defecting/marriage/having a male character desperate for attention and ready to protect the shit out of them nearby/making their male opponent fall through a hole.</br></br>  <br>No, I said that whatever the WG or Akauni can do is after Fujitora's report, see? Fuji had everything in his hands and could do things in the order he wished. It was the same with Smoker.</br>  <br><br>In return, Akainu is talking shit to the Gorosei, something that hasn't been done before.<br><br>I was surprised to see him angrily question the WG like that, he only cares for the marines after all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>   But just remember that Shachi is pure.  <br><br>Damn straight</br></br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Probably, remember Don Krieg is most likely related to the Happou Navy<br> looks just like Sai <br> calls himself Don <br> Sai is Chinjao's grandson, without a father in sight to inherit the title of Don </br></br></br></br>   OP forever ruined by gayshit   <br><br>What, really? That's the whole point of his character; acknowledging/exposing the hypocrisy of the Marines/WG and addressing it frankly. He knows he's been complicit, hence the apology. Why the hell else would he be based on Shintaro Katsu's Zatoichi? Oda is practically beating us over the head with this shit.</br></br>  <br>Thanks obama</br>  <br>He was in control. That's why he chose not to report to prevent the attept of covering the corruption.<br><br>You said he should do his duties. What duties?</br></br></br>  <br>My condolences.<br> What are you even talking about, the gay shitposting isn't even that high in the thread </br></br>  <br>  can't he do that after doing his job? <br>He said that, as an employee of the WG, it wasn't his fight, because it was their employers the one that gave doffy all his power. Doflamingo needed to go down by the hand of pirates, not the WG because they have no right in defeating doffy and then call themselves the good guys since they were the ones allowing doffy to do al that stuff in the first place. So, to be fair, Fujitora's work was not fighting doffy, because technically, a warlord is kind of like his "college" since both are WG's employees.<br>At least that's how I see things</br></br></br>  Reminder that the mystery behind what happened to the Sanji crew and Big Mom has been resolved.  I think Zeff is my favorite One Piece character of all time  <br>Pretty much. Also, Lola and Bonney are sisters. Bonney's ship was even cake themed.</br>  <br>You have a bad gov, your house is on fire but the firefighters are like: we have a terrible gov, you do it because we have not the right. Complete jackshit.<br><br><br>To protect the citizens and remove the threat.</br></br></br></br>  <br> It's just for you, okay? <br>Calling it right now Big Mom and her crew will fight everybody except Nami</br></br>  <br> Leave him to his pity party. He does this any time people idolize the male characters.   Never complains about the /h/ shit that gets posted here though </br>  <br><br>Lies and slander. Shachi pleases old men for money.</br></br>  <br>Well, Nardo is over and no one reads Bleach, now the fujos have to migrate.</br>  <br>Doffy did an attack on marines and WG officials,</br>  <br>Ok, it's easier to understand now.<br><br>The thing I think you're missing is his motivation. <br>•Fujitora wants to disband the Shichibukai. <br>•To that end, he continued to fulfill his duty as a marine and helped Doffy. (Which also furthered his cause because it made the marines look bad)<br>•Then when Doffy initiated the birdcage, instead of going after Him, Fuji pretends to be stalemated by Sabo<br>•When Doffy is defeated, Fuji prostrated himself on live camera to make sure the marines can't steal credit again for solving a problem they caused.<br><br>His motivation wasn't to spite those in higher positions with him and it wasn't really because he felt it wasn't his place (although he did feel that way), his very specific goal is to abolish the shichibukai system, and all his actions are to that end.<br><br>So to summarize, Fujitora let vigilantes handle the situation because it would help him with his goal of abolishing the shichibukai system. Even if you still think he was wrong, his motivations are a lot better than simply being petty.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Magu Magu is his fruit, wouldn't be better something like "just Hie my shit up" or "just Fuji my shit up"?</br>  law is going to die  <br> naruto babies myth <br>Well memed friend. Have a seifukumingo.</br></br>  <br>Is  Jinbe  old enough?</br>  <br>Then he is more of a revolutionary than a cop. As a "cop" he is doing wrong.</br>  Post your favourite pages.  <br> orca fucked by a shark <br><br>That's taboo <br><br><br>No, Shachi is innocent and sweet.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His occupation doesn't matter.</br>  <br>Is the black jumpsuit a post timeskip fashion headcanon or are they actually canon ?</br>  <br>None better.</br>  <br>Please wait. I agree with you that he should had protected the citizens.<br>But then you posted  which makes you like saying he has no right to do so because the gov is corrupted.<br>Unless you're being sarcastic there or not him at all.</br></br></br>  <br>It showed in one color cover. And now Law wears a black jacket instead of his orange shirt.</br>  <br>It does matter because if you are a cop your mission is one and as a revolutionary is another. If he is a cop then he is doing things wrong regardless of his personal view of justice.</br>  <br/>  <br>ill take that into consideration</br>  <br> the most mature character in the entire one piece universe? <br>I think he doesn't hold a grudge more because his dad was an abusive piece of shit who constantly beat him than out of maturity</br></br>  <br>I was making the contrast between Fujitora and Gordon. Gordon is doing the right thing but in OP's bizarre sense of morality and justice he is wrong.</br>  <br> That's taboo <br><br> That's what makes it hot </br></br></br>  <br>Indeed, but I can't help but feel like pointing out their hypocrisy in a naive way.</br>  <br>And further more, technically, he fulfilled his role as a cop to the letter. He sided with Doffy at every point, he captured Law for Doffy, and when birdcage was activated, he was busy fighting Sabo (which we know is just an excuse, but still not a violation of his position, as long as it looks like he was doing something). And then he spent the rest of the time protecting the citizens. If you're judging him by those standards, he did his job just as he was supposed to.</br>  <br>Of course, but he's "showing the Marine's failure" by failing as a Marine.</br>  <br>That was his uncle.</br>  <br>And the hunger games in the birdcage?</br>    <br>Cute. <br>Sanji should have stayed on that boat. He wasn't so shit when Zeff was nearby.</br></br>  <br><br>Wait, never mind. I'm an idiot.</br></br>  <br>there's only one person who's going to die if you don't shut up</br>  <br>We don't need chicks to be relevant in order to have a good story, if their only job in the story is having big tits and act like support caracters (whith the exeption of female SH who can be useful sometimes), I would be ok with that</br>  <br>Its a composite of two pages but whatever. It gives me chills every time<br> Magellan's fist closing in  <br> that look <br>I hope we never see Bon again. He made his sacrifice, it makes me happy to know he's alive and that should be the end of it</br></br></br></br>  <br> Zeff's fucking hat <br>Oda always has to shoehorn something goofy into serious moments<br><br> Sanji's face in the third panel </br></br></br></br>  <br>He never hunted anyone. That was when he was fighting Sabo. And then after that, he immediately went back to sheltering citizens from the birdcage.</br>    <br> Krieg was a weak little shit    stronger than Jozu, though  <br> gets kicked out of the Happou Navy <br> gets anally devastated  <br> travels to the weakest oceans to build himself a fleet of shitters and starts calling himself Don <br>it fits</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> poor little paramecia boy </br></br>  <br>Many of them were in a murder rampage under Doffy's direct control, his mission was to stop Doffy.</br>  <br>Baratie was the first arc I read as a kid, at the part when only Luffy and Sanji were on the ship fighting.

Not really. <br><br>Since seiyuu threads are typically about the younger seiyuu why not show some appreciation to the +35 seiyuu.

Almost nothing is really demanded of them beyond sounding cute and having a pretty face to be used as an event marketing tool. It's very rare you get someone like Saori Hayami or Kouki Uchiyama out of the modern seiyuu mass production racket that can ACTUALLY do it all on top of actually being able to act. I'd argue the former is practically too good for anime at this point, like she could make it as a legitimate entertainer.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Had the pleasure of meeting her, getting an autograph and a photo taken with her at Anime North a few weeks back. She's a really classy down to Earth lady who really does seem to care about her fans and isn't just being micromanaged by her manager the entire panel. She actually overruled the kind of idiot annoying translator guy on several things to try to give a direct answer since a lot of people were asking questions in Japanese and she'd just answer them directly.</br></br>  <br>It's not wishful thinking.</br>  <br> Essentially though at this point most seiyuu are just the same kind of model with a cute sounding voice and questionable abilities at actual acting.

I'd argue the former is practically too good for anime at this point, like she could make it as a legitimate entertainer. <br><br>oh i do agree, very much so. a substantial percentage of the latest batches of idol seiyuu are nothing but eye candy, and actually talented and interesting actors or (gasp) personalities are hard to find among them. but w/e i get jerkoff material out of this so it's cool i guess.</br></br></br>  <br>anecdotes please</br>  <br><br>Wait Emi Nitta did porn?</br></br>  <br>but i WOULD disagree that kubo is prettier than uchida. uchida is a mediocre seiyuu but my god i want to graze her nape with my lips so bad</br>  kanahana is 9 days older than me so as long as she is the queen i won't feel old ;_;  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bdL<wbr>iIS3dh5A</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>That's Sugita, nigger.</br>  <br>women can't be funny<br><br>have you ever listened to female comedians? they are all horrible. the "funniest" woman talks about how much she likes having sex with black men, that's the pinnacle of female comedy.</br></br></br>  <br>those were actually what i was thinking of. i wondered if there is more, though. it's hard to find good stuff between all the glossy and hyper fripside and love live publicity garbage.</br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4SF<wbr>avXl4J7A</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>There's a certain charisma in Hayamin that I don't normally see in pretty much any other younger seiyuu really like she instinctively knows how to carry and manage herself and her image. She really just carries these kinds of gigs all by herself like she's been known to carry some shows and just feels natural and not awkward at all like most seiyuu do when they're trying to put on the whole cutesy act. Actually I hardly ever really see her do that either, she has a tendency to just kind of play things straight and stay reserved while others around her do that only occasionally jumping in when somebody says something actually funny or clever worth commenting on.<br><br>It's like somehow she wasn't trained in one of the regular seiyuu schools you see now and is coming at things from a different angle. Supposedly her main inspiration is Audrey Hepburn so that might have something to do with it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There are other comedians than Lisa Lampanelli and Chelsea Handler.<br> The rest are lesbians. </br></br>  <br>I haven't found anything like the 道場ルノ series, but this advert that she's in is great.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kY9<wbr>4nk_-zE4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>   https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=13&amp;v<wbr>=NxhJ7tu2o50</wbr> <br>is that Nao voice at the beginning?<br>Rare to see seiyuu voice non-anime and western dubs</br></br>  <br><br>Sounds like Ai Kakuma to me</br></br>  <br>Sounds like her to me</br>  <br>Eh, Dragon's Dogma is made by Capcom isn't it?</br>  <br> no IF </br>  <br>Boys don't count.</br>  Why are male seiyuus so much less forgettable than female?  <br>Eh, it's not that bad. Well, not yet at least.<br>Those pretty face seiyuu actually went through training/school, unlike pic.</br></br>  <br>Honestly Rena is actually a decent-good actress but acting =/= voice-acting. You have to have 1) good control of your voice and 2) know how to talk like an anime character. Imouto voice for imouto, etc.</br>  <br><br>So this is the semen demon who portrayed C2<br><br>I want her to dominate me in bed</br></br></br></br>  <br>There have been long standing rumors that she's pretty much just as sexual as CC</br>  <br>Yukana is an old-school pillow seiyuu.<br>She even got a sound director fired when he said he cast her in productions because she would sleep with him.</br></br>  <br><br>Her voice is so lewd. Whenever she whispers into Lelouch's ear it makes my dick stand up instantly.</br></br>  <br><br>What is this, fanservice for ants?!</br></br>  <br>Because male seiyuus are so much less numerous than females.</br>  I'd molest young Kaji.  <br><br>Here's to her voicing more C.C. in the future. I need her to say more lewd things.</br></br>  Ahh mediocre  <br>Better, Derek?</br>  <br>well she did do quite a few OP for eroge so that alone you can assume she had some roles in the game to save time <br><br>And when is she going to sing a more graceful song, Chaos Ring 3's OP is not enough</br></br></br>  I have never seen even one seiyuu that was pretty.  <br>Shikaco gets barely any work and is only getting more because she's actually learning how to act. Aside from Hanazawa (who is technically capable of not completely sucking) the most prevalent female seiyuu do tend to be pretty good.<br><br>I imagine Love Live Sunshine will be another voice acting train wreck though.</br></br></br>  <br> 0 (zero) shows this season <br>Press F to pay respects<br>;_;</br></br></br>  <br>For now we'll make due with her brief appearance in Akito 3.</br>  <br><br>pls tell me she takes that robe off. I want to lick her scar.</br></br>  SPOT THE PILLOW SEIYUU<br><br> If you said everyone except Sora Tokui &amp; Yoshino Nanjo, YOU WIN! </br></br>  <br>would destroy<br>heres my semon devil</br></br>  <br>I am not the only one that finds awkward that Nanjolno started doing this whole Idol business so late into her career?</br>  <br>WITNESS ME AOI-CHAN</br>  <br> everyone except Sora Tokui &amp; Yoshino Nanjo AND Mimorin </br>  <br> willingly fucking Ucchi <br> dragging Kussun into this <br>No anon, no.</br></br></br>  There is something very gap moe about Aoi Yuuki, in how professional and in-control she is at her job (both as a seiyuu and general entertainer) despite being so young and looking even younger.<br>I wonder how her kouhais feel about her.</br>  <br>I was born on exactly the same day as Hanakana. I feel like a fucking loser.</br>  I find Uchida's physical attractiveness pretty overrated.  <br>fug</br>  <br>Ogura and Aoi are the prettiest there.</br>  <br>Even the guy on the left is afraid of Kobayashi.</br>  <br>Become a sound director.</br>  <br>I guess what I am trying to say is that I want Aoi to reassure me while I rest on her arms.</br>  <br>really?</br>  <br>if you say so</br>  <br>Ugly</br>  I only find Y.Aoi-chan attractive. Her hairdo and height are just perfect.  i wish satou satomi would drop the cutesy act. she's actually really really good and the kawaii shpiel feels fake as fuck and entirely unneeded.  Let's laugh of all those who believe that any of the seiyuu are actually pretty.  <br>Aoi is underrated in terms of attractiveness.<br>She also has meat in all the right places.</br></br>  <br>yoi is the way better actress but frankly i'd way rather sexually annihilate the other petite milady</br>  <br>Who is this pancake ass</br>  <br> people look ugly without make up and generally taking care of themselves <br>I wonder if you thought you were making some insightful, scathing point inside your head before posting.<br>That would be cute.</br></br></br>  <br>the one and only takefatsu</br>  <br>How? She is the most beautiful seiyuu I have ever soon.</br>  <br>How was Rena for the rest of Denpa? She didn't sound too bad for the first episode I watched, but if she was going to have such a minimal role I didn't really feel like watching the rest of that shit for her.</br>  <br>When Taketatsu is done doing the idoling thing enough to be available as a woman she's going to put on like 100lbs though.<br><br>It's unfortunate.</br></br></br>  <br>You might think that, but to me she's ugly.</br>  <br>yeah that will probably be the case. nigga just loves to eat. loves fucking eating. she must be anorexic to keep her weight in check, probably worse than tomato.</br>  Some believe! LOL!  <br>dunno what trip you're on, but we all know how makeup works.</br>  <br>Well, on the Japanese side of the web it's not rare to find comments like "people only find her attractive/cute because she is a seiyuu" or "AKB sluts are cuter" or plain "she is ugly".<br>On here the general opinion outside of Aofags seem to be "she is cute but not attractive".<br><br>Between her round face, decent cup-size, decent teeth, her height, glossy hair and general fashion sense I do find her attractive, though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think mannerisms and shortness are cute, plus she has really pretty eyes and hair.</br>  <br>I have no idea how can somebody differentiate so hard between attractive, cute, sexy and whatnot. All I know that I find her personality and looks the greatest.</br>  <br><br>Well she, her personality plays a lot on what makes her attractive.</br></br>  <br>To put it simply, she is a tomboy.</br>  <br>I would't go that far but as I said in <br>there is something very attractive in her loli-ish looks + assertiveness.</br></br>  I love Saorin  <br>Cute has connotations of being childlike, beautiful is admiring the aesthetics of a person as though they were a piece of art, and attractive means you want to fuck it.<br><br>Personally I see Aoi a more cute, like a little kitten.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you fucking retarded? Dragon's Dogma is a Japanese game.</br>  <br>oh man, argevollen is so underrated</br>  <br>I still want to fuck her, date her, marry her and have bear bear my child.</br>  <br>I find Aoi very aesthetically pleasing.</br>  <br>普通 is fine too.</br>  <br>Eh she's attractive enough but classic beauty maybe not.<br><br>You also kind of have to be into the thick. Not that she's fat but she's too short with too much assets to be slender.<br><br><br>That is a bit of an odd illustration.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hiyocchi's delicious Futomomo will turn 30 in 3 days. <br><br>To be honest I see very few really good young Seiyuu these days. Most of the younger ones (&lt;24-ish), even if they've been in the business for a few years already seem rather bland.</br></br>  I'd her donut.  <br>Aoi has good meat.</br>  <br> and have bear bear my child. <br>Anon.</br></br>  How many here have actually met one in person?  <br>It's going to be a sad day when Aoi announces she's getting married. But I guess it's better than turning into a bitter lonely woman like Yukarin.</br>  <br>It is. I wonder how many boyfriends she got by this point.</br>  <br>I don't mind if she gets married around her thirties.<br>And for some reason I can totally imagine Yukarin lecturing Aoi on what not to do with her idol career.</br></br>  <br>Thing is, I never heard any conclusive rumors about Aoi dating anyone, unlike many other young seiyuu.<br>But who knows.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>There's something very comforting about seeing the names of seiyuu whose anime, songs, and radio programs I've been watching and listening to for well over 10 years now. <br><br>Comforting and sad. <br>I'm glad I'm a seiyuu fan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Their high school days are never really exploited, but that's when people fuck like rabbits.</br>  <br>I am glad Noto-san got lead roles these last two seasons.<br>By the way, is Ohanashi Noto still running?</br></br>  <br>Yes.<br>www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm26662497</br></br>  All seiyuu are ugly.<br><br>If they weren't ugly they would be idols, actress or models.</br></br>  Why is Kumiko so lewd?  Just because a girl has fallen over doesn't mean that you get to move in aggressively.  <br>Is Shuuichi attacking her?</br>  Kumiko a cute  <br>I don't watch kyoani shows but damn the girls are fine.</br>  <br>Would you love her even if she was a junkie slav?</br>  <br/>  <br>wait a little bit</br>  <br> riki <br>sasuga</br></br>      <br>Saved.</br>  Can someone please tell me why this is allowed?  What is this face trying to convey?  <br>She's happy because Kumiko is available</br>  <br/>  I only watched one episode <br>Does it get better?</br>  <br>It's pretty much<br> teen angst... in band <br>The anime. So no.</br></br></br>  <br>The characters are cute and the music is great  there's some strong yuribaiting though . Watch until 5 and if you still don't feel it, then drop it.</br>  <br/>  JUST    Instrument AD Takahashi let out incredibly cries while he was working <br>  His gaze while he was correcting the instruments in the latter half of the show was very scary. <br>  In the 12th episode, there was about 150 cuts with instruments in there that frankly couldn't have been done in a typical TV series. <br>  A tiny bit of a confession: the small instruments were drawn by CG, but the bigger instruments were all hand-drawn. <br>  When Ishihara first heard about the show, he thought the instruments should be CG, but when considered the affinity with hand-drawn character, he wanted to have the instruments hand-drawn as well. If that couldn't happen, then he felt the characters had to be done in CG too. Thus, he decided the instruments had to be hand-drawn for this show. <br><br>Discuss</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt; A tiny bit of a confession: the small instruments were drawn by CG, but the bigger instruments were all hand-drawn. <br>These crazy motherfuckers. I can barely manage to produce a decent drawing every 2 weeks but these shitters don't give up.<br>Bless</br></br></br>  How can someone as gorgeous as Reina be so grossly in love with this fucker?  <br>That just means you have a chance with her, anon</br>  <br>If episode 12 already had 150 instrument cuts, then I shudder to think how much worse it must have been for them to animate episode 13.</br>  <br>I don't, really.</br>  <br> &gt; Instrument AD Takahashi let out incredibly cries while he was working <br> &gt; His gaze while he was correcting the instruments in the latter half of the show was very scary. <br>Poor guy</br></br></br>  <br> Takahashi-san, please take special care in the shading <br> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAH!!</wbr> </br></br>  What is left to discuss anyway? Season 2 is never happening...  <br>Kumiko and Shuuichi's romance, for example.</br>  <br> geh </br>  <br>How did Kumiko came to like him anyways? was it his good looks? his good taste in food? his big ass  trombone? </br>  Kumiko: All right class, please all sit. I'll be your music teacher for this year, Tsukamoto Kumiko. I''ll be guiding you through Kitauji's musical tradition which started decade ago.<br>Girl A: Tsukamoto-sensei is it true you were part of the first band who brought the school to Nationals.<br>Kumiko: That's right. Those were the best years of my life and Taki-sensei and he brought us gold in the Nationals in my second year. I hope you're highschool life will be filled with much fine memories.<br>Girl B:Ne, sensei is it true Taki-sensei is a hottie? I hear he has a smile to die for.<br>Kumiko: geh.. I guess, many of my bandmates found him attractive. Don't let his demeanor fool you he can be quite harsh and isn't a afraid to single you out for your mistakes.<br>Girl A: There aren't many boys in band were there any hotties during your time?<br>Kumiko: i guess there was Nakagawa-sempai and Goutou-sempai, Shui.. geh.<br>Girl A: Sensei's blushing did you have a boyfriend from the club? <br>Kumiko: Ah.. I think you shouldn't pry in to your sensei's love life.<br>I know many of you transferred here to compete in Nationals, what instruments do you play. Just a warning, if any of you play a Euph, I won't show any mercy!<br>Girl C: I played the trumpet for 5 years and played band from Seijo.<br>Kumiko: That's nice, one of my closest friends are from Seijo and I hope you show as much enthusiasm as she does!<br>Boy A: Sensei, I'm just a beginner with the flute. Will I really be of any use?<br>Kumiko: don't worry If you work hard and practice your part you can pass Taki-sensei's auditions. <br>Girl C: Kohaku loves the tuba!<br>Kumiko: I'm sure you do Kawashima-san and I hope you carry the love to the Nationals.<br>Don't be afraid to compete with your sempais either, Kitauji we pride a students skills over seniority. I hope to see all of you in Nationals!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your fanfiction sucks ass</br>  <br>adult Kumiko sensei.. I have a hard on. Middle aged Taki with greying hair.. I'm so wet.</br>  <br>Would you?</br>  <br>add wrinkles</br>  I want to fuck Asuka  <br>Whoever wrote this disgusting copy paste has no idea how to write in character.<br><br>Get it out of my face, out of the thread and out of my life</br></br></br>  <br>He's already got one you silly goose</br>  <br>It seems very Kumiko like for me</br>  <br>imagine photoshopped Mamiko with Kumiko colors and we got Kumiko sensei</br>  <br>Get in line.</br>  Kohaku playing Tuba. Platinum Kawashima!  <br>I want to fuck Reina. Look at her, look at her body. She's so erotic.</br>  <br>In what way? She aint one to go into details when talking.<br><br>If you think Kumiko will randomly bring shit from the past up like this; "one of my closest friends are from Seijo and I hope you show as much enthusiasm as she does!" Or "many of my bandmates found him attractive. Don't let his demeanor fool you he can be quite harsh and isn't a afraid to single you out for your mistakes." Not to fucking mention this monstrosity; "Those were the best years of my life and Taki-sensei and he brought us gold in the Nationals in my second year. I hope you're highschool life will be filled with much fine memories." <br><br>Then please for all that is goddamn holy go rewatch episode 7 and pay close attention at just how shitty Kumiko is when it comes to talking with people she doesnt really know yet (Trying to cheer up Buchou)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to marry buchou</br>  <br>Reina ties her hair to look like Taki's dead wife.</br>  <br>what the hell is she supossed to tell her students "eh...geh"</br>  <br>she's a teacher in that setting.

I will be helping out all sections but bass in particular, as I play Eupho.. thanks for having me"?<br><br>Look, my example sucks but its at least more intact with her character. Im not trying to be a writer.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I doubt they would need two music teachers.</br></br>  <br>Taki isn't a music teacher though. He's the club advisor.<br><br>Also, Kitauji would be a Band powerhouse by then. Multiple music teachers would have applied htere</br></br></br>  <br>What? he's nothing but a club advisor?</br>  Kitauji in 10 years.

She would never want to be the reason for a fight.<br><br><br>Liking best girl is not wrong.</br></br></br></br>  <br>she's bland a cry baby and is biased. She's the worst.</br>  <br><br>well Haruka and Asuka held hands you don't think Kyoani won't do anything lewd in the next image considering how popular the ship is?</br></br>  <br>Nah.

No /u/, it was just a really nice scene.</br>  <br>Why?<br><br>I forgot to tell mine <br>I love It because it was important for them also showed how amazing and cool Natsuki is.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Why? <br>Good trumpet playing.</br></br>  <br>The Kumiko/Shuuichi fistbump scene, and you very well know why.</br>  <br>That was truly amazing indeed.</br>  <br><br>Indeed. But  was the only scene to make me tear up.<br><br>As for my favorite, does the entire final performance count? If not, then Reina's solo. Fucking gorgeous.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cause she's shit</br>  Why are yurifags so fucking disgusting and annoying?  <br>Because it's Haruka's turn to comfort Kaori and it's really cute. On the whole I really like the close friendship between these two.</br>  <br>Because normally their headcanons mix with their obnoxiousness, causing them to project their fantasies on the character in the show and in the threads, forcing yuri where there is none.<br><br>However, with Hibike! is understandable. They were baited pretty hard. I even thought it might actually end in yuri at some point, but like Hyouka, it didn't end in anything tangible.</br></br></br>  <br> 4:19 <br> 4:20 </br></br>   two weeks after the final episode <br> bestsuki is already forgotten </br>  <br>But look at the shit they write on pixiv het drawings. <br>I hope the butthurt kills them all.</br></br>  <br>That's really the hetfags fault.</br>  How many children?  <br>How is their fault?</br>  <br>Tell me how their first time will be.</br>  <br>3. One plays a tenor instrument, one bass and one keyboard..</br>  <br>Team Taki cmon</br>  <br>Oh wait... no you said a het-drawing?<br>Never mind them. <br>Mind posting the full page tho?</br></br></br>  <br>That Ribbon's breakdown. Her tears were delicious.</br>  <br>That is so cute.</br>  <br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51372545<br><br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=50590230</wbr></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>To be fair, the pic the Yurifag posted is much better, artistically speaking.</br>  <br>What does that have to do wit anything?</br>  <br>Nothing really. <br>I'm just saying, if it were up to a vote, i'd support the yuri picture simply because it's much prettier.<br>But you're not wrong. Yurifag was bein a dick.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a shame. Pixiv should kick western fuckers that don't taki drawing seriously the fuck out. They do nothing but damage the community.<br>I've never seen something quite like this before in pixiv, fucking yurifags man. I want to kill them all.</br></br>  <br>All the wallking home, transportation scenes.</br>  <br>So im wondering, are all those yurifag picture made because the artist supports the ship or because the know the ship is popular and well-defended?</br>  <br>You really think nips care about that? they just want to draw what they feel like drawing.</br>  <br>One goes pro and living in Vienna, one becomes a salaryman and one becomes a hetfag neet who shitposting in every Hibike thread.</br>  <br>Glorious. All their sexual tension finally released.</br>  <br>I guess not.<br>Couple of decent drawings for a shitty popular thing could bring a lot of traction to your page, you know?<br>Why do you think people make doujinshi mostly, instead of original works?</br></br></br>    <br>Because of the need to see our favourite characters get fucked in various ways</br>  <br> taki </br>  <br>Because in doujinshis they can draw what they'd like to see themselves. If I could, I'd draw doujinshsi all day long.<br>Look, before pixiv there were tons of independant websites and blogs were people drew nothing but fanart, and you had to look them up trough affiliations.<br>Artist draw what they like because they can, not because they want popularity. This isn't tumblr.</br></br></br>  <br>all according to keikaku</br>  <br>Do you think you could fap to your own work?<br>That's like fapping to your own baby!<br>I'd get too preoccupied from the flashbacks of all the work I put into it, and just end up satisfied that other people can get off to it.</br></br></br>  <br>All band students are nymphos.</br>  <br>I wouldn't fap, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't like to draw a character that I find attractive in a sexual situation. Damn I'd do it in a hearbeat.</br>  <br>T-the art I mean.<br>Not the baby...</br></br>  <br>I dunno. <br>I guess im just the type that doesn't see the point unless im working on my own shit. Or for money.</br></br>  <br>Mizore's one of the harder girls to describe I guess. I mean you can't call her the kuudere because she's nothing like that. She values herself based on how other people value her, which means she has horrible self esteem. She feels worthless most of the time if there isn't someone else with her. But mostly she's a pretty dishonest girl, not to other people but herself. <br><br>For example, Mizore doesn't actually even think she's good at the oboe, she just plays because it's the only thing she thinks gives her worth right now. She hopes she's good enough but won't accept that she's actually pretty fucking good. She's quiet and spends most of her time alone but she actually has a lot of things she wants to say. She also hates being alone but avoids people at the same time because of her self esteem issues. Yuuko figures this out about Mizore pretty early on which is why Yuuko tries to keep Mizore company when she can. Mizore thinks Yuuko is just pitying her so she doesn't like Yuuko when in reality they're actually really close. Mizore is also really cute when she gets worked up.</br></br></br>  <br>You've got no hobby then, anon?</br>  <br>Fucking this.<br><br>I have no words to describe It.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean, I wouldn't fuck the baby, but I wouldn't be happy people were getting off to it...</br>  <br>Mizore sounds like an idiot.</br>  <br>Yes. Justice was served.</br>  <br>Fuck you<br>Mizore is love</br></br>  <br>Of course I do.<br>Drawing original stuff is my hobby. <br>I've got massive, beautiful stories to tell trapped inside my head, you know?<br>I'm glad other people make porn of stuff I like for me to consume, but if it's porn I want to consume it to gratify myself.<br>I don't think I could do that if I were the one working on it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I remember pitying Yuuko for this scene. Well now I know it should be the other way round.</br>  <br>Jesus Christ, embarrassing.<br><br>I hope degenerates die.</br></br></br>  <br>It's difficult to understand this for me. I'm an artist myself, but I've got no interest in drawing original stuff. All I want to do is draw what the show didn't give me and what I picture in my head, which is pretty damn gratifying.</br>  <br>rip</br>  <br>Then I guess you and I are two very different kinds of artists.<br>I seek satisfaction through expression, while you seek it through interpretation?<br><br>In any case, I suppose i'll try doing more fan art for things I like. <br>Maybe it'll help me get better an drawing my own things or give me inspiration.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The whole sequence until she remembers Reina is fucking amazing. It's probably the most important and well made scene of the show.</br>  The whole last episode gave me chills.  <br>Well, all kinds of art is a way to express yourself. You've got musicians that like to compose their own stuff and others that play songs written by someone else.<br><br>It's the inspiration though, liking something so much you can't help but draw what you'd like to see with it. Not only that, but by drawing fanart your "mental library" gets broader. You learn how to draw differently depending on what you're trying to imitate. Is the best, would recommed 10/10 you should totally draw your favorite girl right about fucking now and post results.</br></br></br>  natsuki = bestsuki  <br> draw your favorite girl right about fucking now and post results <br> Disgracing the beauty that is Asuka with my shite hands.  <br>Not at least for another 2 months of hardcore training.</br></br></br>  <br>for how long have you been drawing, anon?</br>  <br> there are people who thought Haruka was a bad Buchou </br>  <br>Just drawing shit?<br>3 years.<br>Seriously, in pursuit of a career?<br>2 months<br>Using digital?<br>1 month, but on and off for the last year or so. I'm not quite used to it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's not bad, just incompetent.</br>  <br>got any art in you that you can share?</br>  What are they planning to do to ribbons?  <br> pitying Yuuko for this scene <br>why?</br></br>  <br>they'll kill her for being an annoying piece of shit</br>  <br>Nothing digital worth looking at. Got some hand drawn stuff I submitted for my college entry portfolio a few weeks ago.<br> http://imgur.com/a/pUqBT <br> All the still lifes were done withing the time frame of September 2014 - December 2014<br>The fancy design pieces were made from Jan 2015 - March 2015. All the character art pieces were made scattered before, between, and after those time periods. The earliest might be the witch girl, the latest is the girl with the visor/headphones.</br> </br></br></br>  Wish soemone would pick up the mango. I need my H!E fix.  <br> His romance was cut in his own anime in favor of yuri bait <br>Is there a bigger loser than shu1?</br></br>  <br>Download berserk. Redraw a panel each day for five months and you'll be somewhat decent.</br>  <br>Okay. <br>At least I have some sort of direction now.</br></br>  <br>what exactly do you mean by "redraw"?</br>  <br>She wanted to go to the festival with someone but no one was available. And that was before the whole audition ruckus. So of course I'd feel sympathetic for her.</br>  <br>Great advice, but it'd take more than one day for beginners to draw one page of that. <br><br><br>pick a page and redraw it yourself. Doing this with a great artstyle series as Berserk you will become a decent artist in a few months.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How far is the manga?</br>  <br>I hope they kill her</br>  <br>so redraw != trace, correct.</br>  <br> annoying piece of shit <br> this show would literally be a boring pile of shit romance with nothing else going on if she wasn't stirring shit up an generating banter <br>sasuga</br></br></br>  <br>webm</br>  <br> sasuga <br><br>heh, I see.</br></br></br>  <br>up to the auditions</br>  <br>I welcome the new triumvirate.</br>  <br> Great advice, but it'd take more than one day for beginners to draw one page of that. <br>Not exactly a page, but a panel. Starting with volume 1 and then advancing, improving along with the author. <br>I've come to realize Berserk has everything, good anatomy, shading, face features, perspective. It's great practice. Even during its beginning, although it wasn't a quarter as good as it is now, it still followed the basics that even pros know nothing about.<br>Damn Miura.<br><br>Nope. You're not drawing over it, you're trying to copy it. The same way you draw life figures, gestures or landscapes.<br>Not the same anon, not the same.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn, that's some good production values.</br>  <br>I was trying to read the raws but holy shit the manga art is so different (even thought it's closer to the novels, maybe?) it's kinda painful.</br>  <br>it's kyoani after all</br>  <br><br>Main characters are pretty much the same though.</br></br>  <br>You misplaced Kumiko. She should be first.</br>  <br><br>Aye, usually a running scene is a good excuse for a studio to cut back a bit since the motion kinda hides stuff, but KyoAni doesn't cut corners.</br></br>    <br>I really like all things Asuka... but i'd be lying if i said that scene didn't make my heart skip a few beats.</br>  <br>Wait, has it not been translated at all?</br>  <br>garbage taste</br>  Still best girls.  Reina~  <br><br>No, with the pace it's going we'd probably reach vol 2 this year.</br></br>  <br> Hazuki &gt; Reina &gt; Yuuko <br>I thought you have to stick either to Reina or to Ribbons<br>Liking both is a perversion of nature</br></br></br>    <br> Reina's one piece </br>  <br>why does she likes one pieces so much?</br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>A-another reference i think</br>  <br/>  <br>leina</br>  <br> crossed legs  <br><br><br>I thought you were talking about this one?</br></br></br></br>  Anyone have the full picture of eyecatches?

Also she's sex incarnate.</br></br>  <br>d-don't say that about  my waifu  y-you faggot </br>  <br> Right because she's the only one that doesn't have any issues. <br>Did you even watch the show?</br></br>  More Kumiko sensei please  <br><br>Yeah, she just wants to prove Asuka wrong or some shit. Nothing much compared to Ms.daddy issues and Ms.special-snowflake.</br></br>    You guys know the reason behind Reina's desire to be "special"? has she been like that her whole life?  <br><br>She's always been like that.</br></br>  <br>She was always extremely talented at music. When she was a child, her talent made others jealous, so they bullied her a lot and she never had any friends. One day, Taki, who is a friend of her fathers, visited her home and cheered her up by playing. That's when she decided she wants to become special.<br><br>Or something like this, it's been a while since I've last seen those spoilers.</br></br></br>  <br>That's...kinda cute.  hasn't she known Taki for 4 years though?  </br>    <br> She's known him since 3rd grade in the novels </br>  Hibike/K-on cross-over when?  <br>Fuck off back to reddit dude, at least put some effort in trying to be funny</br>  <br>Why is she floating in the air right where Kumiko can see her  lack of  pantsu?</br>  <br>Why not?</br>  <br>Maximum lewd here, Yabuki level lewd.</br>  <br>Stop that.<br>Reina is a very special little girl, I'm sure she wears very special pantsu.</br></br>  <br>She's wearing the Emperor's new pantsu here, they must be really special.</br>  <br><br>Pantsu are for ordinary plebs anyway. Reina is always a step ahead of others.</br></br>  Because Kyoanus needs the fanservice to sell their shit.  <br><br>The need to yuribait is also a must for them so desperate for viewers.</br></br>  <br>I'm so glad that if we get a second season the yuribait will switch to Mizore and her flute friend. So, so glad.</br>  <br>So is more than a teenage crush in the novels...I wonder why they changed that in the anime.</br>  /r/ing the gif of taki sensei conducting with the rising sun flag  <br>I wonder how mad the threads are going to be when it doesn't after spending all this time convincing themselves.</br>  <br>Seems a bit weird to have a 3rd grader fall in love with an older man and stay in love with him for all these years. It's not like a 3rd grader even understands the concept of romantic love. Her crush on him seems a bit more credible now that she only fell in love with him when she was already 12-13 years old.<br><br>And it would also explain why she doesn't know he was married, since by the time she met him, his wife was already dead.</br></br></br>  <br> Seems a bit weird to have a 3rd grader fall in love with an older man and stay in love with him for all these years. <br>It only shows is more deep in my opinion. I'm sure she's had plenty of time and chances to meet new people, but remaining in love with someone older than you and going as far as following him to a school so he can be your teacher tells me Reina's love for him only grew into something quite serious.</br></br>  <br>But that's also the case in the anime. She's been in love with him for what, four years now? That's a pretty long time, especially for a sixteen year old. It's not like her love for him in the anime is any weaker - if anything, anime portrayed her love and jealousy as stronger - she was never jealous of Kumiko in the novels, was she?</br>  <br>Don't you think her love for him in the anime could pass as a teenager crush? it's not uncommon.</br>  <br> Reina's love for him only grew into something quite serious <br>I've got no problem with age gap relationships, but Reina's feelings for Taki and the way it influences her behaviour are not healthy.</br></br>    <br>Care to expand on this?</br>  where the fuck in the show says she's only known him for 4 years?  <br>It will be a blood bath of course. Besides Mizore/Nozomi shit isn't even Yuribait. Though I really wouldn't put it past KyoAni to project their issues onto Kumiko and Reina. Novel Anon did say that Kumiko had some doubts about her friendship with Reina and wonder if they will stay close in the future. I can totally see KyoAni focusing on that issue.</br>  <br>Itoanon stop</br>  <br>I suppose it's the way she turned down an invitation to a better school so she could stay closer to him.</br>  <br>I'm not sure.<br>Four years is a very long time for a simple teenage crush. And while teens do act possessive and jealous of their crushes (like everyone else), she does it to a pretty extreme level.<br>Kumiko is not only her very best friend, she's also her only friend. And she still sperged out upon hearing Kumiko spent time with Taki-Sensei at night. That's not really a healthy reaction.<br>I'd say it's more of an obsession than just a crush.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's love for you baby, it makes you do pretty bold things.<br><br> I'd say it's more of an obsession than just a crush. <br>I like to call it "fucking love" little man.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There was never a scene that showed her being jealous of Kumiko in the novel. Kumiko never told her she was with Taki in the novel. That scene was only played for laughs in the anime.</br>  the anime also had an original ShuxKumiko scene.  <br>That scene made for laughs made me realize how infatuated she's with him though.</br>  <br>I'm sure there's going to be plenty of anime original scenes with Kumiko and Reina in season 2, but since they don't really have any major interactions outside of that conversation, solo dedication and the fireworks date, I can't imagine there being any major yuribait scenes comparable to episode 8 and 11 ones. There's probably going to be some yuribait it's just going to be a lot lighter. And for the yuri bait to be taken "seriously" in season 2, they'd have to tone down Reina's obsession with Taki-Sensei, and I don't think that's going to happen since season 1 already ramped it up instead of toned it down.</br>  <br>An obsession is unhealthy, more so than a crush. You can call it love, but I call it insanity. or stalking. And believe that is not cute, I had people stalk me before and I'm telling it was scary.</br>  <br> it makes you do pretty bold things. <br>And especially in an age gap relationship because you are at different life stages with different priorities.</br></br>  <br>She's 158cm tall sixteen year old girl.<br>I'm sure Taki will be fine.</br></br>  <br>Reina doesn't act on this though. She doesnt' call Taki at all hours, she isn't rude to him or violates his privacy. She just looks at him, wishing they were holding hands and trying her best to become special so he can notice her.<br>Quite cute if you ask me.</br></br>  <br> Meanwhile, on /u/... <br> "Reeeiinaa..." <br> "Wraps her arms around..." <br> "Slowly... pins her to the locker..." <br> Haha what a bunch of faggots, eh Reina? <br> Huh? Oh... y-yeah... <br> Reina tried to push the images from her mind. She loved Taki, didn't she? But she couldn't deny the sudden feeling between her legs at the idea of pinning Kumiko to a locker... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this the work of some photo-mosaic app from Hell or of a deranged genius?</br>  <br>Maybe they will tone down Reina, but what about Kumiko? They already toned down her scenes with her and Shuuichi. And compare to the novel they shorten and altered a lot of his important scenes with her, some of them that were really adorable. I could see them amp up her insecurities and thoughts about losing Reina as a friend, which was only a little issue in the novel.</br>  <br>Taki has nothing to lose. When his wife died, a part of him died with her too. He's teaching to achieve her dream. <br>Reina is the one who should focus on more important things, and she does, doesn't she? Novelanon mentioned she wants to go to Music uni overseas. it's perfect, she can be with Taki when she comes back </br></br>  <br> That scene was only played for laughs in the anime. <br>Sure, but that doesn't make her reaction any less genuine.<br>It's not out of character compared to her episode 5 comments and future jealousy from season 2 with that other teacher, if Kyoani decides to adapt it.</br></br></br>  <br>It's Google's Deep Dream engine, basically a feedback loop of Google's image recognition algorithms trying to make sense of an input image.</br>  <br>Second novel she actually is stalking him.</br>  <br>I guess she manages to grow some tits over the next few years?</br>  <br>what? going to school at 6 am just to see him from afar is considered stalking?</br>  <br>Asuka is such a babe.</br>  <br>She also keeps a photo of him in her wallet. I'm not kidding her obsession with him is really unhealthy.</br>  <br>Depends, does she masturbate while she's doing it?</br>  <br>Did you know she has a taki shrine in her closet? that shit is beyond unhealthy</br>  <br>There was a scene where she follows him I believe. Also she has pretty strong yandere vibes.</br>    <br>I think you're throwing the word "stalking" around because it sounds bad and you want to see her love for him as something bad, so I won't take you seriously.</br>  <br>EUPHO</br>  <br>Do you have the one where Yuuko's ribbon becomes birds?</br>  <br>What are you talking about? She really does have that type of vibe on her. Like someone else said, she keeps a photo of him in her wallet.</br>  <br>What's left fagott's name?</br>  <br>Sauce on this,  because it's the cutest sit.<br/> .<br>And Reina isn't a Yandere unless she threatens/hurts someone over Taki.</br></br>    <br><br><br>Arcimboldo would have loved this.</br></br></br>  <br>Kurumi Kitamura</br>  <br>As far as I know, Shuichi only has two "romance" scenes in the second novel. First one doesn't even involve him personally, it's just Reina teasing Kumiko about Shuichi. And the second one is him comforting her again at the end of the novel (happens in all three). So it's not like Shuichi matters one way or another.<br><br>As for Kumiko's insecurities for Reina, I think if they ramp that up, it would be a bit out of character for her, as it would contradicts the events of episodes 11, 12 and 13.<br><br>The impression I got of Kumiko and Reina's relationship in the last three episodes is that Kumiko finally grew out of her desire to be Reina's "follower" and became her "equal". She's no longer someone who clings to Reina but is instead an equal partner in their relationship. That's what I got from the episode 11 comfort scene, episode 12 conversation about wanting to be special as well, realization that she loves eupho and in general, the way the two interacted in episode 13. Kumiko just doesn't seem like she's "smitten" with Reina anymore. Mind you, I'm not saying they don't have a very strong and intense emotional connection, just that Kumiko doesn't seem like she feels inferior to Reina anymore.<br><br>So to have her make a much bigger deal out of that scene would seem out of character to me, as it would contradict the previous relationship development between the two.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her expressions make me think she really will kill someone. She may not do it, but Its easy to believe she may think of it. Which can still be disturbing to me. Overall I just think she's too unstable.</br>  <br>First chapter, clearly showed him as the romantic interest and Kumiko's closet friend. He is more shown than even Hazuki and Midori in the novel.</br>  <br>What happens in that scene?</br>  <br><br>They can't keep downplaying Shuichi if they truly intend to follow the novel. At some point they'll have to make Kumiko's attraction to him obvious.</br></br>  <br>She had the perfect reason to look unstable and jealous as fuck in episode 12, but she didn't. Come on, it seems you don't like Reina at all.</br>  <br>In the second novel its not about being inferior, its about losing a friend. As Kumiko listens to Nozomi and Mizore talk about their past, it makes her afraid that her and Reina might not be friends in the future, and that they will only drift apart after high school.</br>  <br>i hate dogs <br><br>a dog killed my cat <br><br>delete this</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Compare to the anime, Kumiko wanted Shuuichi to apologize to her of what he said in junior high. She didn't leave him at the bench. Shuuichi grabbed her arm and wanted her attention, she kicks him for talking about a pretty girl in his class out of jealously.</br>  <br>she is one of us then</br>  <br><br><br>Literally perfect.<br>Asuka time?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh. You're talking about the scene from the volume 1, right?<br>I was talking about Shuichi's presence in volume 2.</br></br>  <br>aka divine fagott</br>   yfw Kumiko is the one that comforts Shuichi this time next season   <br>In the second novel he has even fewer appearances. There is one scene that was about Kumiko and him holding hands which made her embarrassed, the Reina teasing her about him scene and another Daijobu scene at Kansai, but that's it from what I recall in the spoilers. Anyway the novel really just makes their attraction to each other obvious.</br>  /a/ loves their faggots.  <br> I want more Kumiko sensei please </br>  <br>Ok</br>  <br>In the first scene Kumiko thinks about when her and Shuuichi held hands before the performance, she felt very embarrassed about it, and when she looked up she bumped right into Shuuichi, which made it a little awkward before they went back to being comfortable around each other, Though Shuuichi still keeps his distance from her, which annoys Kumiko, as seen when she mutters about Shuuichi not asking her to go with him to the fireworks festival.</br>  <br>Nah its always gonna be Shuuichi doing it, its a ritual in all three novels.</br>  <br><br>I'm just saying if Kyoani really wants to make the pairing canon then they'll have to start developing it. As it stands now it's pretty vague, I can see them making original scenes with Shuichi next season. Kyoani making Taki-sensei and Shuichi close is a good sign I think.</br></br>  <br> Though Shuuichi still keeps his distance from her, which annoys Kumiko, <br>What's his problem?</br></br>    <br>He loves her man, its hard to be friends with someone you love.</br>  <br><br>He doesn't want to be seen talking to ugly girls.</br></br>  <br>Maybe, maybe not. We'll just have to see where they are going with it. Because the main characters are really the second years, Kumiko and Asuka. And as of now KyoAni isn't focusing on the romance, they are focusing on the band.</br>  <br><br>Of course it's gonna stay on the back seat.</br></br>  <br>and Reina and Taki, who are important in the subplot.</br>  <br><br>Probably the awkward fingers entwining shit which never happened in the anime so I don't think they'll be awkward or be avoiding with each other.</br></br>  <br>I think they can tone it down a notch</br>  <br>She isn't ugly, she is fluffy.</br>  <br> Kumiko playing Riki <br> not Meepo </br></br>  <br>And yet it sold like shit.<br>;_;</br></br>  <br> think they can tone it down a notch <br><br>Tone what down?<br><br><br><br>Probably just made even. I wouldn't say it's a flop.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It sold 2 frt m8.</br>  <br>Reina's love for Taki</br>  <br> And yet it sold like shit. <br><br>Are you fucking retarded?</br></br></br>  <br>The entwine fingers people are talking about are the ones between Kumiko and Shuuichi in the novel.</br>  I saw a japanese movie where the girl fell in love with the teacher and then she went to study overseas but she came back a year or two later and reunited with her sensei and her feelings hadn't changed and they kissed at the beach. It was beautiful.<br>I know Reina was the director of the movie. I just know it.</br>  <br>How old was the sensei? in his 20s?</br>  All this speculation are fun but i'll personally wait for s2 announcement first, I dont want to get my hopes up.  <br>there's this one with Taki sensei in it which I think looks nice</br>  <br>I think so. He was hot and all the girls wanted his D.</br>  <br>I still find the lack of boys amusing</br>  <br>Best Japanese age gap movie is Okuda Eiji's Shoujo, though.</br>  <br>Why wouldn't you just put the blue border on that one too?</br>  <br>Reina dropping the bottle in hearing Kumiko was with Taki sensei is literally the same scene as Reina dropping and shattering a glass cup on hearing that Taki sensei might have a girlfriend. And that just spirals down into pure suffering.<br><br> Taki: For today and tomorrow, Niiyama Satomi sensei will be in charge of directing the woodwind section. She will also help direct the woodwind section after the training camp. <br> Taki: Tomorrow, Hashimoto sensei will also come to direct the percussion section. <br> Taki: The woodwind section will practice in the second hall, percussion and brass will be practicing here. Niiyama sensei might young but she is is extremely talented. Make sure to follow her orders. <br> Niiyama smiled shyly in response to what Taki sensei said <br> Niiyama: Extremely talented? You're not getting anything from flattering me you know <br> Taki: of course not, but I am only saying what is true <br> Niiyama: oh my, well I'm happy to hear that then Taki sensei <br> the club members watched with a cool gaze as the gorgeous couple in front of them scattered an air of freshness. <br> Curious as to what Reina was thinking, Kumiko turned her head to the trumpet section. Reina was watching the couple with eyes that greatly resembled a dead fish. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Shojo <br> Not "The Sex Lives Of Dirty, Retired Old Men Who Are Making A Fresh Start 2 Miki Sunohara" <br><br>Your loss</br></br></br></br>  <br>I always get  horny  with horn girls.</br>  <br> Your loss <br>Judging from the title, somehow I doubt that.</br></br>  I'll find a JAV title fit for Reina.<br>Wait for me.</br>  Who's cuter?  <br>Both look like fine young men.</br>  <br>But whose dick would you rather have in your mouth?</br>  <br>This one looks better, thanks</br>  <br> School Love Story Look, Look!

She's already studying actual english and talking with several advisors to set up a graduation plan for herself. This is even after she declares she'll take Gold at Nationals for Taki sensei that she'll still study abroad to become the best that no one ever was. So she'll win Gold for Taki sensei, go overseas, come back when she's like 20+ and then they will make a concert band. </br></br></br>  <br>The little sly fucker has everything planned.<br> DOUJINSHIS WHEN </br></br>  <br>So you're saying  she will travel across the land, searching far and wide, teach concert bands to understand, the music that's inside ?</br>  <br> So she wants to become the best that ever was for herself, right? </br>  <br>yes this whole trip is for herself</br>    <br>noice</br>  Aoi will always be the slacker of my heart.  <br>Mine too anon, mine too.</br>  So I've been out of the loop for the last few weeks since episode 11, what's this influx of posting about the blue-haired Oboe girl?  <br>She's the second novel main's character</br>  <br>She's MC of S2</br>  <br>Do you like Nozomi/Mizore?

I want to hear kumiko make more cute noises</br>  So what happened to that background character couple?<br><br>they still fuckin' ?</br></br>  <br>Mizore and Nozomi are some of my favorites but they don't need to amp their importance because they take up literally half of the 2nd novel just by themselves. However, they're not allowed to interact with eachother until the very end and this really isn't something you can change for plot related reasons unlike Kumiko and Reina.</br>  <br>  tfw stills are the worst looking part of the show <br>Just how?</br></br>  <br>Really? Well at least both of them miss each other, and their recoiling is gonna be cute.
