[ Genocidal Organ movie preview<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jZE<wbr>K0fbmXKY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Will this save Animation?</br>  How long will the movie be?<br>It looks too good to be true</br>   Manglobe <br><br>PV looks nice from an animation standpoint but I don't know, the name Manglobe doesn't give a good impression.</br></br>  <br>Isn't that music copyrighted by someone else?</br>  Who's Itoh?<br><br>Anyway, this looks really good, but I have the sinking feeling it's not going to do well in the box office.</br></br>  <br>That might be pretty good. Gotta love those gritty military anime movies. Oh and hyper violent too.</br>  What do you guys think of Cuck: The Manga?  Fucked up shit, but I still read it anyways. There no possible way it will end in happiness. Nice boat ending is all I can hope for.  If you could choose your own stand what would it be?  <br>So combing Dark Blue Moon with either C-Moon or Moody Blues nerfs the latter two horribly.</br>  <br>Stealing that for a JoJo RPG I'm running. Gonna be quite the shock for the players when this seemingly ordinary guy challenges them and actively tries to get himself killed by them.</br>  <br> Boy II Man and Mandom <br>Standard Boy II Man RPS game except instead of stealing power the winner takes time (life) from the loser. Maybe a week of their life or more and there is no limit to how many games it can play.<br>As for a name, 「I'D DIE FOR YOU」</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit that'd be a cool villain Stand.</br>  <br>The Lock+Jail House Lock would be terrifying though, wouldn't it?</br>  Gakkou Gurashi thread<br><br>Its all-time sales across all vols were 80,501 copies. It sold 119k just last week as the anime started.</br></br>  <br>That's quite a bit of effort. What fuels you?</br>  <br><br>Separate cafeterias for different years I guess?</br></br>  <br>what do you mean?</br>  <br>Also what are Classroom 1-9 supposed to be since the 1-A~1-D classes are on the right side</br>  <br>Nevermind. I misunderstood. Forget it. Now I'm embarrassed.</br>  This is just bad taste.<br><br>This horse girl, Just imagine that bellow her waist, she is just like a horse. <br><br>Who would want an waifu that has a disgusting pussy like a horse? Yuck.<br><br>I can see this is a typical Harem anime. But how would anyone self-insert into MC? Zoophilia is just disgusting.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> every night is S&amp;M night <br><br>Sign me up.</br></br></br>  <br>Same here. I've been arachnaphobic all my life and I just couldn't get it up to a spider, even if there was a beautiful woman attached.</br>  <br>Lots of people who liked the artist's porn work migrated towards the ecchi manga and then to the anime. What's not to get?</br>  <br>I want a normal 2-D girl instead.</br>  <br>I'd like to be her tits</br>   translate a bunch of series that almost no one interested in <br> drop series that popular <br>stay classy /ak/</br></br>  <br> service <br> unpaid and in your own free time <br>That's not service. That's a favor.</br></br></br>  <br>The worst ones are the ESLs that use machine translation. <br><br>Yes, these actually exist.</br></br></br>  <br> what is analogy </br>  <br>There are a lot of scanlation teams out there that look for translators on the regular, so you can always go to the people who are doing the series you like the most and ask them if they'd like another translator.</br>  <br><br>Which series is this?  I'm guessing?<br><br> If it's not Gate lolsomeoneelsecandoit </br></br></br></br>  Read the guide before asking anything buyfag related;<br><br>http://buyfag.moe</br></br>  <br>These, only these. Oh, and maybe some Dragon Ball (not Z) and Lupin figures. I really want a King Piccolo figure.</br>  <br>I hope you're not determining people's tastes by their figures. Posters tell more since they are easy to obtain from every possible series, but only popular stuff gets figures.</br>  <br> but only popular stuff gets figures <br>Not entirely true, but yeah, his posters are pretty pleb.</br></br>  <br>Well, you know what I mean. Some weird stuff get figs too but it's mostly the shit that sells.</br>  <br>The posters are on the same level as the figures. The only redeeming feature, aside from stuff I can't identify, is the framed Sora no Woto picture.</br>  So, how's the arc? For some reason the threads have always been dead before they reach 200 posts since the arc began  <br> Oh </br>  Can anyone tell me what the fuck is going on?<br><br>A-are they leaving?  ;_; </br></br>  <br> gintama <br><br>More like SADtama, right anons?</br></br></br>  <br>When the anime adapts this arc.<br><br>Slowly going there</br></br></br>  <br>Depending on how long Gorilla makes this arc I'd say the anime will go on another break and pick back up at the start of the assassination.</br>  This hasn't been updated in awhile. What should be filled in for 2010-15?  <br> Dragonball <br> Dragonball <br> Dragonball <br> Dragonball <br> Dragonball </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> some fucking monotone lady talks over the music <br>What is the fucking point in this cancer?</br></br>  <br><br>nice shit tastes anon</br></br>  <br>I think your tastes went to hell somewhere around 2012/2013.<br><br> 2013 OreImo S2 <br> 2014 Shirobako <br> 2015 year isn't over yet </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no kaiji </br>  Fuck me Zaraki, those don't grow back you know  shinigami are spirits how can they haves nerves. kubo messed up.  <br> Become all powerful <br> Be too retarded to make any use of it <br>Kubo is too deep.</br></br></br>  <br>That's meta knowledge though, what he's asking is what purposes in universe is there.</br>  <br><br>Good thing you weren't here for the Rukia Bankai chapters then</br></br>  <br> kills a person whose Bankai is literally about melting the flesh of her opponents <br> kills the top medic in Soul Society <br> all to give one guy a vague chance of a power-up <br><br>I'm pretty sure Unohana's death was less about her backstory, and more about Kubo wanting an excuse to have characters drop like flies. Can't have edgy death counts if there's a medic around I guess.</br></br></br></br></br>  Armpit pussy.  You guys are too soft. Post some actual porn.        <br>I like my armpit pussy with some hair personally.</br>   /ai/ - Idle Activities   <br> In Precure! </br>   /vp/ thread waiting for the next pokemon episode has more Aikatsu discussion than /ai/ <br><br>Truly ded<br><br>Anyway, the episode was cute  and lewd  as fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It can't be helped. I stopped bothering with Aikatsu livestreams anyway. Can never be sure if there's a working stream and no one's here to talk about it regardless. Also, I'm not caught up.</br>    <br>The mov3 stream has been reliable for a few weeks now, the guide should really be updated with it  even if there's only one or 2 other people that bother to livewatch it. </br>  Does this guy get evil now that he's a lich? He's not going to be running around saving people, r-right? <br><br>Because that's not what I'm signing up for.</br></br>  <br>Step it up Evo</br>  <br>german?</br>  <br>Log Horizon was shit. Author should have stuck with Maoyuu.</br>  <br><br>It's funny how you think it's funny because it comes from Overlord. I bet if this came from any other series you would be dropping memes all over the place.</br></br>  <br><br>skellingtons detected<br>clickity clack back in the sack<br>clickity clack back in the sack</br></br></br></br>  Web novel download edition. Let's get some translations going.<br><br> www.mediafire.com/download/sag6vj0h<wbr>zt67l5e/JSDF+001.odt</wbr> </br></br>  <br> Couldn't they just explain it as a marriage for love? <br> Like Prince William and Kate Middleton, except Kate was under qualified and the like. <br>That would work if Itami is single, and not having a squad of women around him. She really would like it to happen but she couldn't force it. And she definitely can't beg for it unless she can do it without anyone finding out.</br></br></br>  <br>So the only way this works is if Itami went to the senate and asked for her hand in marriage?</br>  <br> So the only way this works is if Itami went to the senate and asked for her hand in marriage? <br>And you KNOW he wouldn't do that willingly.<br> That's why the plan was to use a love potion. Desperate measures... that didn't work out </br></br></br>  <br>I think the girls right now have to force him to bed and  reassure him that they won't leave him for eternity. Trust issues right? Because of the incident with his mom. <br>This is just like DxD's girlfriend issues and self-flagellation.</br></br>  <br>It's not really trust, he is just lazy and doesn't want to deal with complicated relationships. He was married just fine and didn't have an issue before. And being Pina's consort is number 1 on the list of relationships that would bring a tonne of undesirable issues.</br>   It's time.   <br>She took Waka/Seo pretty far in their last chapter, so I'm hoping she'll do the same for those two.<br><br><br>I'm pretty sure there's been canon gay  side  characters in shounen manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The artstyle is so fucking ugly, what the fuck is up with those colors</br>  <br>It may not be /a/, but god dammit I love swordsluts.</br>  <br>The inevitable anime will be sub-Kancolle tier</br>  I want shota Worick and Nicolas to experiment with each other and Worick to get turned on by Nicolas' deaf guttural keening noises when they make out.</blockquote>]
