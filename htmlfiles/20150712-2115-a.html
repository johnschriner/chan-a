She will be drawn, you just got to have hope!  Humbly requesting mon amour. <br><br>If possible, I'd like to request her either swimming or her lounging by the pool while a maid (Kikuno preferred) brings her a drink. <br><br>I'd be most appreciative if she were drawn, thank you!</br></br></br></br>  Requesting anything cute, funny, or cool of Nio, please.<br>Thank you to anyone who may be interested.</br>  Any good Mana Ouma fan art?  <br>Reimu!</br>  Good evening!

Hey, hope your weekend has been alright so far. Requesting my Asuka punching a vending machine after her soda gets stuck temporarily. Depending on what angle you're drawing from and if you plan on getting detailed, you can make the soda a Dr. Pepper or an RC-Cola. Maybe a Pibb Xtra. Coke is also a solid choice.<br><br>However, anything cute and decent is fine.

Requesting Risty dressed like this http://imgur.com/a/ALIjW  <br> totally a different person </br>  Requesting Tetora with anything anniversary themed, something with her blushing would also be nice.

No specific idea this week but I'd love to see more of him wearing the fabulous rings and other accessories that were featured in last month's issue of Animage Magazine.

I realize the filesize might be too large, but you should rework/figure out how to compress it. White spaces are a bit much as well.

Otherwise something like a halter top and short-shorts!  Requesting Asui Tsuyu doing some shenanigans with her tongue, or heck whatever your heart desires. It can go up to 20 meters so you can be creative with it. For example she could do housework with it, maybe do pull-ups next to someone doing them traditionally, or even asked to write an answer on the board but merely using her tongue to do so. Or if you want to go more romantic have her use her tongue to grab an arm and force it atop her head, giving her a head-pat. And finally she can eject her stomach fun fact.  <br>Wow that's great, do you take commissions?</br>    <br>where is the text?</br>  <br>Post  Stalin  pls</br>    Requesting Kohaku, from Tsukihime, unleashing Ea.

Don't have a commission sheet yet though, if you're interested you can just message and ask for a quote on what you want through  lowercasek.deviantart.com  I guess. Probably will put up an info sheet on  tumblr  soon surely.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>wasn't sure if you'd like the teeth one which is why I showcased the more vanilla one, but i'm glad you do! have a nice week yourself <br><br><br>haven't done delivieries in a while, but yep. I went as kimo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks to the anon who drew this!</br>  Requesting my lovely bassist, Akiyama Mio, for the 14 Juillet, Fete Nationale in France.<br><br>I'd like to see her either in a cute/lewd situation, hiding her body/wearing a french flag<br><br>Or as a revolution soldier storming the Bastille (with muskets and everything)<br><br>Anything cute would be good too.<br><br>And please, no jokes or surrender or white flag, thanks.<br><br>Thank you if you consider, and have a nice week-end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot to colour their eyes.</br>  <br>You deserve it drawfriend I'll draw a lot of Chens for you Honk Honk!!</br>  <br>Which is why he said he didn't finish it.</br>  <br>Thank you for adding the text, it's perfect now.</br>  <br>Oh, I've been waiting for this. k is one of the few drawfags I've always wanted to commission.</br>  <br>Also, that pokemon was cute, but unfortunately  it was requested by someone else in a different time zone at 4AM when I was sleeping, and Gendar isn't my favorite pokeyman. </br>  <br>Oh! I just saw this! I really like the longer hair and the outfit, but the one thing I wish more drawfags do is draw her right ear more. She has a habit of tucking her hair behind her ear all the time, and I feel like it sets her apart from Rukia and other similar black-haired characters. But I still love the fact that she is in a collage with other mahou shoujos and  is in the center~ </br>  <br>Ahh, I didn't even notice when I was looking at the reference! Fixed some stuff too.<br><br><br>Thanks anon. <br>Chen a cute but she isn't my waifu so you should probably draw other people's waifus instead.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who's your waifu?</br>  <br>I don't have one unfortunately. <br>I wish I could be as dedicated as you guys but I'm afraid I'll just lose interest one day.</br></br>  <br>Thank you once again, anon! I really love it.<br> I'm sure everyone appreciates the time you are willing to invest for people with waifus, even though you don't have one yourself! </br></br>  <br>Are you going to be able to get to all of the requests? You're doing a great job with everyone's waifu's.</br>  <br>Do you take commissions Anonykun?</br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>It's happening!</br>  <br>Nice job Phalanx. How many more do you have left?</br>  <br>Looking solid</br>  <br>I would never hire this party.</br>  <br>Three?<br>Did I miss two?</br></br>  <br>Anon, I love you forever.</br>  <br>Yep, you missed 2.</br>  <br>Don't worry about it.<br>Not having a waifu is much better than pretending to have one just to fit in.</br></br>  <br>Beautiful work, Phalanx. It is my absolutely unbiased opinion that this is your best FF waifu party yet!<br>The colors are especially inviting.<br> And thanks again for including Nio's tattoos! </br></br></br>  <br>Where is it?<br>I don't see it on the booru.</br></br>  <br> Don't go anywhere Niobro, I have something for you as well </br>  <br> tfw your waifu gets to team up with a KlK, AND a JoJo <br>Fuck yeah.</br></br>  <br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/index.<wbr>php?page=post&amp;s=list&amp;tags=phalanx_%<wbr>28artist%29<br><br>Check quickly before some speg starts deleting the tags.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>I'm going to try my hardest but I can't guarantee it. After all, I'm doing this for fun.<br><br><br>I do. You can send me a note on tumblr or email me if you want. It's anonkyun@gmail.com<br><br><br>Very nice.<br><br><br>I hope I'll meet him/her someday.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh my. This weekend is too much. I'll excuse myself from the threads next week to make up for it.<br>Thank you mystery drawfriend; i can't wait to see her!</br></br>  <br><br>Here you go: </br></br>  <br>Where is the healer?</br>  <br><br>I didn't realize two were done last week, one must have slipped past me.<br><br>Items only!</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is the glass canon party.</br>  <br>Aw, I'm going to miss seeing you next week.</br>  <br>Tamamo is a Conjurer.<br>She's a healer AND an elementalist.</br></br>  <br> Thank you. I hope she was drawn. </br>  <br>Four groups, I think. <br><br><br><br><br>Thanks!<br><br><br>You're very welcome, Niobro! <br><br><br><br>Don't blame me, I used a random number generator and that was the result.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have a condition; I'm not going to deliver unless you promise TO request next week.  Nio is too cute and the only reason I finished crazy assassin lesbians - the anime </br>  <br>That first party is probably the strongest.</br>  <br> You drive a hard bargain. And that is an offer I can't refuse. <br>You win, drawfriend.</br> </br>  <br>It's stuff like this that makes me wish people would watch my waifu's series or play the VN's.<br><br>Oh well</br></br></br>  <br>Phalanx please. I wasn't even around last weekend when you took requests for your FF collages but you still included my husbando. This was very unexpected but timely,  I finally started replaying 7 yesterday because of remake hype , so now I have a huge grin on my face. This party is a mess but I mean it in the best way possible, I really like members you included and class choice is pretty interesting. He looks great in your style, thank you very very much! Thanks to you I can finally go to bed, have a fun weekend, looking forward to the next party you'll draw.</br>  <br>Why would you replay that ugly ass game when there's a remake coming out?</br>  <br>Gee, maybe some people want to play the game before 2017.</br>  <br>The second is probably the most diverse. And the white mage gives that team a huge advantage in terms of healing over the other two..</br>  Requesting realistic wifu  <br>Nostalgia, Anon. The answer is simple. Besides, no one said remake will be a carbon copy of original, so when something is changed, I will actually notice it after refreshing my memory.</br>  <br>If they're keeping cross dressing Cloud, not much is going to be left out.<br>If anything, it should have more.</br></br>  Requesting Nyaruko doing a JoJo pose please  <br>Party 1 may only have a Red Mage for healing, but I'd like to see the other parties try and beat it's damage output.<br>Party 3 might come close, but party 2 is clearly a gimmick for funsies party.</br></br>  <br>I think party 2 could be a contender with the right strategies. Party 3 has only one defensive player, unless the conjurer were to buff the others. Party 1 is OP but lack a competent healer. They're all relatively well balanced.</br>  <br><br> I hope I didn't get your hopes up too much, but I promised this to you at the beginning of the week. Hope you like it, Nio a super cute! </br></br>  <br>Cute as heck. Niobro got some nice stuff tonight.</br>  Misato deserves more love!  <br>No, you got my hopes up just the right amount! I've been looking forward to your colors.<br>The Star Spangled Banner has never looks better! And I love the way you did her skin tone.<br>But the best part is definitely her hair. You made it look so soft and fluffy. It's super nice.<br>Thank you, colorfriend; have a wonderful week!<br><br> I kind of feel guilty. But I certainly won't complain. This was the best weekend ever! </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>tried it for a maka request in the waifu thread</br>  Humbly requesting Vega  Does anyone wonder if  Monsterfag plans to deliver?   <br>Thanks a bunch phalanx! Tamamo looks gorgeous and I'm happy you gave her a radiant smile. They all look great, too. She really looks too cute, I love it.</br>  Requesting Kirika Misono, thanks.  Requesting Minatsu wearing a nontraditional miko outfit. Visible midriff and outfit matching ribbons is a plus.<br>Anything else is fine too, thanks!</br>  <br>This is really cute, love the way they are both jumping.</br>  <br><br>You bastard, you stole my idea for next week! Good taste and good luck with your request though</br></br>  <br>Super sexy! I wish I could get lewds like that.</br>  <br><br><br>Delivery! Sorry i took so long, i attempted to draw my own background but  i gave up , so here's a background made with a photo, shit-ton of filters and even more layers.<br><br>Highres version and no BG version over here:<br>http://imgur.com/a/IyOg1</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not bad</br>  <br>Very neat.</br>  <br>Nicofag here, thank you for drawing her again boa! I almost got scared away again from the really lewd drawing of her last thread. I love it! Your art is so nice</br>  No delivery? That's okay, I'll request next week. <br>  I bet it's because she isn't moe but oh well  </br>   SOON.  Chomp Chomp   <br>Oh man, I missed this. I should really look at the whole thread before replying. Thank you so much! Super duper cute draw friend, I love it.</br>  Requesting.  Now I see why so many people want Boa to draw their waifus. He's fucking good.<br><br> Now I, too, will strive for him to notice me. </br></br>  <br>He's really good, but he's a fucking asshole, he has no tact.</br>  <br> he's an asshole <br>He's really not. He's actually a nice guy, and really humble.<br>He just lacks tact, as you said. But he's not a mean or malicious person.</br></br></br>  <br> He has no tact <br>I suppose there's something good to be said about that.<br><br> Unless you actually mean he's an asshole and calls people's waifus shit, but no good drawfag does that.  Right?  </br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw he's drawn her 3 times </br>  Despair has already settled in. I'm not even in the sharkbait collage  <br>neck is too thick like a ripped dude</br>  <br>Why are you still mad about things that happened last year Chelseafag?</br>  <br> tfw he drawn her this week for the first time </br>  <br>Reminder that as long as you apologize, you can draw murdered waifus.</br>  <br>Same here. Feels good.</br>  <br>Neck looks fine bruh</br>  <br>Same here, almost it was just a sketch</br>  <br>What was that? Link?</br>  <br><br>thanks!</br></br>  <br>I'm working on it now JADF, just busy most of the day today so haven't gotten much of a chance to work on it til now. Not going to finish until sometime Sunday afternoon or night.</br>  Read the guide buyfag.moe  First for Preordering the 2015 Figure of the Year™.    <br>Also the first for "hide post" in this thread.</br>  I have 1200 JPY worth of credit in my Amazon.co.jp account. What should I get? It's gonna expire soon.  <br>Put it towards this fine specimen.</br>  <br>I second this. Whales are an excellent investment.</br>  <br>Why do you come to the buyfag thread if you just hide and don't discuss things relevant thread's topic?</br>  <br><br>All this Pochaco spam.<br> I like it </br></br></br>  Reminder that you can still get this smile  <br>うるさいｸｿﾃﾞﾌﾞ</br>  <br>Because Pochaco is sickening. She adds nothing to these threads but unsightliness.</br>  <br>Pochaco a cute when she wears clothes!</br>  <br>No, still gross.</br>  <br>Why are girls with big weapons still a thing? Not that I'm complaining.</br>  <br>Not really tbh</br>  <br>I want Pochaco in a skin-tight titty-ninja outfit.</br>  <br>Because I'm a big guy, anon.</br>  <br>But I want to see her fat butt at all times.</br>  <br> not wanting pochaco's fat butt stretching a tight pencil skirt in an office lady pochaco fig </br>  <br>Why is she sweating? <br>Did she finish her "workout"?<br><br>That would be boner inducing, so yes pls gibe.</br></br></br></br>  God shit, I figured I'd used tenso one time and try it out after big in japan took 5 days to send my shit after it arrived.<br><br>Fuck, tenso's automatic shit is just beautiful but the fucking price man. I wish BiJ incorporated this or some other competition did.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm absolutely convinced you're one guy samefagging every thread.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Will Alter actually manage to find a way to delay a renewal? <br>I already know Kotori is as good as confirmed for a delay.</br>  <br>BiJ is cheap but they can be really slow to send your stuff at times.<br><br>I only used them once but it took them 3 days to reply to my e-mail.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, yes I am how did you know?</br>  <br>Still mad that they changed these two. Anybody who buys them over the originals is either a retard or a fag/fujo as far as I'm concerned.</br>  <br>Literally a muumuu.</br>  anyone up for IA/VT colorful crystal box at the end of the month?  <br>What's it come with?</br>    <br> I paid scalpers over triple the retail price for the originals. <br> Th-they're so much better! </br></br>  <br>By definition it is not and you are wrong.</br>  <br>Depends on how much they're charging for it. I'd only want it for the nice box and extras it comes with; I don't even own a Vita, nor any other console, for that matter.</br>  <br>well that sucks. it's worth a buy, assuming you're a vita owner. the pre orders are closed now, but it was 8500 yen<br><br>i was just wondering if there were any other ia vita bros getting it</br></br></br>  <br><br>Izaya doesn't look bad, Shizuo on the other hand, the hair, the color, face, is trash compared to the original.</br></br>  <br>They look fine and it just seems like you're trying to justify your expensive purchase.</br>  <br>Are you dumb or what? If I had them (I don't) I'd be happy that the re-releases are shit. The way it is now I either don't get shizuo, or I pay 12k or whatever he costs now for the old one.</br>  <br>Had this preordered since last year. I'm ready.</br>  <br>Not worth 6k plus shipping.</br>  <br> 8500 <br><br>It doesn't come with a vita, right?</br></br></br>   tfw poison will be your first male figure   <br>Natsume was delayed for a little over 2 months, so it's not like it'd be a first.</br>  <br>Nice joke anon.</br>  <br><br>It was an actual question, hard a s fuck to believe you get all that for 8.5k when a Vita with nothing here where I live is $250~</br></br>  <br>Akiman said she was a girl.</br>  <br><br>As someone who got the originals when they first released, I agree that they look like shit. Shizuo more so because of his pouty face and incredibly bright hair. Izaya's hair isn't bad but there's something about his face that bugs me.</br></br>  <br>That's why it's not a legit question, why would they give you a Vita? Those extras are already generous as fuck.</br>  <br>it's not 8500$, it's 8500 yen, equivalent to 85$</br>  Anymore announced at wonfes?  <br>You'll know in two weeks.</br>  Can't wait for my next paycheck so I can buy some Hestia Figs.    <br><br>They have to. Momo and Mea were like 6 months apart from each other, Sairenji took a year, hopefully with Darkness 2nd Season they'll show at least one prototype and a picture of another one.</br></br>  <br>hey, there's /y/ and /cm/ for faggots such as yourself.</br>  <br>Hoping for Yami or Mikan.<br><br>Waiting for Amiami to put up this beauty. It's unfair that TLR has so many good upcoming figs and great figs in general.</br></br></br>  <br> Waiting for Amiami to put up this beauty <br>This</br></br>  <br>I've thought about getting this because I'm a sucker for lolis and gradients<br>Don't know if I'll get arrested or not, though</br></br>  <br>Waiting for the lingerie yami. I'm not too fond of loli or darkness edge Yami.</br>  This will get a rerelease right? RIGHT?<br>Why do I miss out on all the good things in life?</br>  <br>It actually did get a rerelease. On hobbystock though.<br><br>I was able to get one when I went to Japan in May. Feels good.</br></br></br>  <br>Absolutely not</br>  <br><br>Not to fond of her, leaving aside that I really don't like loli Yami since she's nothing like the Yami I like, the scale just looks too simple for that price, I mean, just to compare it to the other TLR scales coming out, Trance of Darkness, Sairenji and Kotegawa are only 1-2k~ more then her, and they just look way above her in detail, sculpting and quality, can't shake of the feeling she should be like 7k max.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I mean a fourth rerelease.<br><br><br>Stop hurting me anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ryoubi, Ryouna, and if this poll holds up until the 14th (updated on the 10th) Yozakura will get a daki.<br><br>I'll buy Ryouna and Yozakura if thats the case. I have a lot of fucking daki covers. My first is basically destroyed now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And there's the condom that you should have been squirted into.</br>  <br>whoops</br>  <br> Ryouna <br><br>I need a scale of her, fucking love her.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I can see what you mean. Hair looks kinda clumped together with her, like they just wanted to pump it out asap. Like they could cut corners with time because she's just wearing a night gown</br>  <br>Ignore the homosexual plebeians, anon. A true connoisseur would know that Hestia is one of the greatest idols of our generation. She is assuredly a gift from the gods.</br>  <br>She has too many good figs coming out (two is too many).<br><br>Sento is more appealing and doesnt have shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Not lewd enough. Aside from that fact, that art style just looks odd on a daki.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>So much fig material with her. I have the toyworks set, it's so cute.</br>  So much terrible taste lately<br><br> to love ru <br> danmachi <br> amagi <br> senran <br> pochaco <br> /v/ shit <br> sao <br><br>What happened to these threads?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Both were just FoTM shit, that's why they didn't get many scales. Since scales need from 6 months to a year to release they need to make them from characters that are actually going to last more than just the initial 4 months hype. <br><br>I'm fairly sure once the Amakuni Hestia is released everyone is going to be like "Oh, right I ordered this.. meh"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> wahh wah stop liking things that i don't like </br>  <br>How can you tell me that this isn't, beyond the shadow of a doubt, absolutely and undeniably perfect?</br>  <br>Well anon in a year I'll let you know</br>  <br>Agreed, we need some REAL figs like Miku and Saber.</br>  <br> senran <br> pochaco <br>Did nothing wrong</br></br></br>  <br>You are fucking with me right.</br>  <br><br>Heh, forgot the picture.</br></br>  <br>I sincerely believe Sento has staying power and I'm waiting for the good figs to come out for her.</br>  <br>Give us your taste then.</br>  <br>It's so much better when the fags don't even know the name of the character or where it's from when they buy them.</br>  <br>What is "good taste" for you, friend?</br>   tfw I don't know if I want this  <br><br> &gt;inb4 kek la meme </br></br>  <br>Because Sento is literal perfection.</br>  <br>Actually, I'm sure that by that time, DanMachi Season 2 will have just started premiering. As such, hype will be rebuilt, and people who didn't order the fig are gonna be kicking themselves for not doing so.</br>  Post your preorders and rate others.  <br>I'm sure I want it <br> Kek la meme </br></br>  <br><br>is sad because it's true, since she has a April-May release set and there's at least another 2 scales from Amakuni coming out around that time I wouldn't be surprised if she was delayed until Jun/July.</br></br>  <br>Literally anything that's not a mascot, a boat, or generic harem/ecchi shit.<br>I'd rather see the fucking Free boys than the garbage you guys post.<br><br><br>Even this mediocre shit is better than 95% of the other figures posted itt.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>shit/10</br>  <br>I picked her up at  AX , she's pretty cute. I'd go for it, if I were you.<br><br>And to set the record straight, KlK was excellent, and is not a meme.</br></br></br>  <br>Underage weeb/10</br>  <br> one piece <br>No.</br></br>  <br/>  <br> he actually thinks they are going to make a second season in a year <br><br>How new are you? <br><br>Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't the BDs selling like shit?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Only 1 idol <br> No ya yoi or Iori <br>bruh.....</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>The crying is disgusting though. Stuff like this never translates well in 3D.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I haven't even touched that prop.</br>  <br>Fits her because she was the biggest pile of turd in the entire show.</br>    <br>Honestly, that's one of the reasons why I want her<br>That was one of the cutest things she did</br></br>  <br>Takane is the only good one that is out/up for preorder.<br><br>Chihaya, Haruka, Azusa arent up yet. Waiting for Anya.</br></br></br>  <br>The splash look like hands</br>  <br>Her and Senketsu made the show kill yourself retard.</br>  <br>So keen for more  Perrine. </br>  <br><br>Kongo Bust not yet pre-ordered, waiting until WonFest to see if if I'll actually get it.</br></br>  I'll be able to buy pic related sealed in box locally for $50 CAD. The ad mentions something about "Sp parts included". Anyone know what that means? were there some exclusive extras I don't know about?  <br>Pre-orders for it close Wednesday though.</br>  <br>SP stands for "Semen Painted".</br>  <br>Hairbuns were a GSC preorder bonus</br>    <br><br>Thank you. Also is $50 CAD a good price for her. I think I've seen her cheaper in some places but shipping would push it way over that price.</br></br>  <br>If only they would release CA statues. I would buy the fuck out of a  Pretty Salian figma. </br>  <br><br>It was extended actually, which is nice. Didn't really feel comfortable ordering something that expensive for Jan with still a lot of stuff market as 2015 on my waiting list and Wonfest around the corner.</br></br>  <br>You're pushing it.</br>  <br>tell me that top comes off.</br>  <br>I saw the Kongo Bust at AX. Personally wouldn't buy it and I like Kongo a lot for what it's worth.</br>  <br>Bishoujos aren't cast off.</br>  <br>IT's a craigslist ad and It 's been up for over a month think i should try asking for $40 or something</br>  <br>She's going for $52 on amazon right now, and I've seen her on manda for 5500 yen. You missed out though, a couple days ago amazon dropped the price to $36.65. I managed to snag her up before they raised it again. 50 isn't a bad price with the bonus.</br>  <br>Yeah most of the villains were shit, MC was shit. <br>Almost all of the supporting cast were shit. <br>Mediocre over hyped anime is over hyped</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeh i saw that, it was only for amazon.com and i live in canada. The exchange rate + shipping would be bad.</br></br>  <br><br>Aw shit, just noticed you were talking about Moosebucks. I thought we were talking about freedomdollars. Disregard what I said.</br></br>  <br> Dat Momo <br>Holy shit where?</br></br>  <br> the guide </br>  Opened this just today. Nothing's too special, but as a Keyfag I'm impressed with how the box is put together.<br><br>$170 well spent.</br></br>  <br><br>God damn, I just saw this after reading your post, granted, I didn't liked how the normal version looked, but it looks worse on person it seems. Hoping that the Keiondou ver doesn't look as bad, but even then, not so sure about getting her now.</br></br>  <br>Running through store list now, should have occurred to me before I posted</br>  <br> nothing too special <br> $170 </br></br>  <br><br>That thing is fucking terrifying.</br></br>  <br>I remember wanting this like a year ago. Kinda glad I didn't buy it.</br>    <br>I feel the same way too, actually.<br><br>Then again, it's a collector's item that's really hard to find nowadays. I think there's value in that, at least.</br></br></br>  <br>Was a fucking moron and only preordered the game last year when it came up for preorder.</br>  <br> I think there's value in that, at least. <br><br>I can definitely empathize with that feeling. It'd absolutely be nice to have, but I know I won't be dropping ~$170 on it anytime soon.</br></br></br>  <br>If I'm honest the mouth sorta freaks me out, but it's not a deal killer to me.<br><br>And I need to stop getting into older series and expecting to find anything available for purchase. All it does it get me more hindpained the longer I search.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought it looked better in person. The viewing angle is pretty strict though I think. Looks creepy if seen from the wrong angle.</br>  <br>There's definitely going to be Touken Ranbu petits sometime in the near future. <br><br>I wonder if I should get a box to scalp.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Really wish they hadn't changed the designs for Shizuo and Izaya.</br></br>  Would you wear figures?  <br><br>I got pretty fucked over by the EMS shipping, actually. The box itself was only 9000 yen. The exchange rate didn't help either.<br><br>I've seen this box being priced at $400+. So yea, 170 is a bargain...sort of.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a little too much.<br><br>Keychain/badge armor is where it at.</br></br></br>  <br>Jesus, how could that thing cost so much to ship?</br>  <br>Should start rolling in soon.</br>  <br>Rate my taste but don't disagree with me</br>  <br>Were get at?</br>  <br> tfw missed Azusa pre order </br>  <br>They have 'em on eBay for comparable to what he paid.</br>  <br><br>To be fair, it was a large, 2.5 kilo box.<br><br>I tried SAL small packet, but Mandarake forced me to use EMS.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fixed that for you buddy</br>  <br>Fuck so it was you who bought that<br> I hope you enjoy it anon </br></br>  <br>Incoming shit taste.<br><br>(Wo and the CCS figs are currently being held captive by customs)</br></br></br>  <br>What is that in the 4th picture?</br>   sent from /jp to here <br><br>ive really been interested in figurine making lately. ive never sculpted in my life but ive looked into the process and kinda get it<br><br>is there anything i should know about in advance? especially about eyes and fine details and other methods</br></br></br></br>  <br>I debated for a while before deciding to get her, since I have no idea how high she'll go afterwards.<br><br>Eh I like Kaneki enough, even if it is Koto. I would've expected someone to cross out &gt;jointshit before anything else though.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, Lucina is cool, I hate TG with a burning passion but even I'll admit that figure is really well done</br>  <br><br>Ever since I missed out on it two years ago, I've been searching Mandarake for that box on a weekly basis. You'll be surprised how quickly these items come and go.<br> Thanks, by the way. Better luck next time :3 <br><br><br><br>Mini-posters. Similar to the ones you get off AmiAmi.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I have Alter Rin preordered because Rin is my favourite, but damn does Kotori look good.

I see human experimentation come up as a topic in so many anime, that I can just assume all anime writers are ignorant college drop outs who just lever learned that this kind of thing is very illegal.  <br>illegal does not mean "it's not done".<br><br>That aside: I am completly with you. This gets used too often.</br></br></br>   generic scientests are evil episode <br><br>cause there isn't a single neurologist in the world who wants to be good.<br><br>kek, I'd drop it but then I'd have to drop all the tropes.</br></br></br></br>  It's an easy way for writers to poke at the viewer's emotions, and an overused and lazy one at that.  Charlotte is the last straw on the camel's back for me with this shit<br><br>"Durr-huurrr scientists did inhumane studies on humans" is getting real old</br></br>  <br> Its illegal therefore human experimentation is non existent.  <br>Shit OP, even after the code human experimentation was used in the western hemisphere, the us syphilis experiment, the mkultra, the guatanamo bay. I guess those involved are college drop out too huh?</br></br>  <br> this kind of thing is very illegal. <br>so are weapons and drugs</br></br>    <br>It's no different from "the Church is evil" or "the Government is evil" (which does apply in this series as well, since those scientists seem to work for the Government).<br><br>They probably use it, because a single, small evil organisation isn't as scary as the State going after you, since otherwise, you could have the government protect you, but it's harder to run away from the State (or some huge, international entity like the Holy See - even though this one doesn't have nearly as much power as it used to have in the past, like back in the days of the HRE).<br><br>I see they tried using some X-Men-esque setting, but in the X-Men the story somewhat works, because part of the State IS after them and the people in general are afraid of them, causing mutants to be segregated, and thus it is socially desired for mutants to be detained and/or under control by the State.<br><br>In this case, though, the idea and setting seem very, very unpolished.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> so are weapons and drugs <br>Come to Colorado sometime.</br></br>  <br>Its all really a metaphor for individualism vs. society anyways so they might as well make it a bunch of chunnis like the blue king from K</br>   all these STEMfags mad about a simple plot-point <br>Obviously the world they live in is not like the real world. Also they aren't saying "hurdur all scientists are bad". <br><br>Get off the slippery slope and enjoy some anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Evil figures of authority are a staple in Maeda's works, though.</br>  <br> individualism vs. society <br>Not really, for example, the MC was a bad example of negative individualism, by being too selfish. This being Japan, copying looks really bad (more so than in other places), so that's another thing against it.<br><br>On the other hand, whoever helped Nao is a good example of an individual and a society in which its members help each other out - unless it turns out later this person was actually using her all along - I mean, this idea of placing every other ability-user or potential ability users sounds all sort of fishy, especially when we already saw Nao and her brother placed in a seemingly high-school that apparently treats you nicely (as in, the take care of your financial problems), but is actually using you as a lab rat.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I mean the twist seems pretty obvious there, the benefactor is going to betray her trust by using the school as some sort of weapon or experiment, Nao is going to lose her last remaining bit of faith in people, MC is going to bring it back, blah blah blah.<br><br>I don't really see how else things are going to play out to be honest.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you really this naive?</br>  <br>But America experimented on American citizens inside their own country by testing biological weapons on the population even after WW2.<br><br>Nuremberg Code doesn't affect America.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you?</br>  <br>Yes, it does.</br>  <br>Idk. Japan has a history of evil scientists. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_<wbr>731</wbr></br>  <br>But the CIA tried to create human psychics for military use by experimenting with LSD and shit.</br>  <br>They could play it straight and the person who helped Nao is actually good - it would be boring, but it's possible.<br><br>I think it's likely the person who helped Nao is likely Yu's father. I mean, it wouldn't seem far-fetched.<br><br>That being said, despite the poorly developed setting, I think the anime would have been better had they bothered laying out the setting they had fully in the first or second episode, rather than just introducing the characters. For example, I would like to know if society is aware of ability users or not. I mean, there are some abilities that must be more overt than others.<br>If society is aware of these people, what's the general feeling toward them?<br><br>I also would prefer if a story wouldn't make it obvious the MC will develop something for the main girl (even if everyone and their mothers expect it), by showing it in the OP sequence, or by having the MC show interest in her few days after he met her - and especially after she beat him badly for almost no reason. You would expect him to try to keep her at a distance, at this point in the story, and only show interest in her as he gets to know her better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I never understood this, in all these human experiments they're always testing on white kids, why never black people? Where's the equality?  <br>They're doing experiments on humans, not animals.</br>  <br>Humans are animals.</br>  <br>No they aren't.</br>  MC of this is imitating Lelouch to an insane degree.  I'm enjoying the fuck out of it.    <br>Kingdom: Animalia<br>Phylum: Chordata (vertebrata)<br>Class: Tetrapoda (Mammalia)<br>Order: Primates<br>Family: Hominidae<br>Genus: Homo<br>Species: Sapiens<br>Sub-species: Sapiens</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're just being edgy.</br>  <br>Sounds like hoodlum hogwash, The Creator made a human before animals.</br>  <br> The Creator made a human before animals. <br>Nope:<br><br> 20 Then God commanded, “Let the water be filled with many kinds of living beings, and let the air be filled with birds.” 21 So God created the great sea monsters, all kinds of creatures that live in the water, and all kinds of birds. And God was pleased with what he saw. 22 He blessed them all and told the creatures that live in the water to reproduce and to fill the sea, and he told the birds to increase in number. 23 Evening passed and morning came—that was the fifth day. <br><br> 24 Then God commanded, “Let the earth produce all kinds of animal life: domestic and wild, large and small”—and it was done. 25 So God made them all, and he was pleased with what he saw. <br><br> 26 Then God said, “And now we will make human beings; they will be like us and resemble us. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> nignongs <br> homo sapiens <br>You do know that sapient means intelligent, right? Kek.</br></br></br>  <br>How does that prove humans are animals? They're different things created at a different time.</br>  <br> The Creator <br>Opinion discarded.</br></br>  <br>You said humans were made before animals, and I proved you wrong.</br>  <br>Yes, but humans are still not animals.</br>  <br>Nice hipster attitutude you got there, I bet you laugh at people going to Church on Sunday.</br>  <br>Is the show any good?</br>  <br>Yes, homo refers to man (as in, human being) and sapiens refers to sapient.<br><br><br>Genetically, human beings are animals.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Anime is reality <br>Please stop</br></br>  <br>Actually humans and other mammals are both made on the sixth day, and both from the soil.</br>  <br> You would expect him to try to keep her at a distance, at this point in the story, and only show interest in her as he gets to know her better. <br><br>That's exactly what he is doing you dumbshit. Also Nao is attractive and mysterious so is no wonder so dumb sap like MC would fall for her<br><br> MC's father <br><br>They clearly spell out another sibling, and I doubt it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So that would make plants animals too? Since they're kinda from the soil and stuff.</br>  <br> rioting at the drop of a hat <br> playing "knock out game" for fun <br> sometimes just killing their own infants <br> practicing cannibalism, slavery, bestiality, trading diseases like trading cards <br> "human" <br>Kekitty kek.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>there is no reason that we aren´t animal.<br>Except Muh special.</br></br>  <br>So that would make plants animals <br>please</br></br>  <br>I thought plants were humans after going through a grinder and a pasta machine</br>  <br>Well, those are some of the qualities human beings have.<br>Do you think we're some sort of saintly beings created by some divinity of good to be "good"?<br><br>We've got our nice side and our ugly side, and even in our ugliness, we've made some interesting things.</br></br></br></br>  Anything that moves=animals<br>Anything that doesn't move=not animals<br>It's that fucking easy, retards.</br></br>  <br>So you're telling me I'm a salmon? Fuck you, I'm not a salmon, shithead.</br>  <br> Anything that moves=animals <br>So, an android would be an animal?</br></br>  <br>Yes? Why wouldn't it be?</br>  Will you autists just shut up? You sound like a bunch of middle schoolers who just took their first biology class. Things like tomatoes, bell peppers, cucumbers, and pumpkins are botanically fruits, but we call them "vegetables" because there is a meaningful distinction to be made between sweet plant matter you can eat raw, and bitter/nonsweet plant matter that are traditionally cooked prior to consumption. How is it so difficult for you to conceive of the notion that the distinction between humans and all other animals is just as useful to human communication?  <br>The 3 or whatever works you're referencing aren't enough to make this sort of statement.</br>  <br>That's not what I mean. Genesis states that humans and other mammals were created separately, the same way and on a separate day than other 'lower' animals. <br>In the narrative of Genesis, humans are closely related to animals. When God asks Caïn about his brother, Caïn answers "Lo yadati, ha-shomer achi anochi?", "shomer" is usually translated as "keeper", but more accurately means herder, ie keeper of animals. Caïn took the close relation between animal and man too far, he slaughtered his brother as one would slaughter a sheep.</br></br>  <br>so a growing tree is a animal?</br>  <br>I just wanted to know if I had to check my priviledge.</br>  <br>Is flowing water a animal???</br>    <br>Except mainly blacks do those things.</br>  So that's "Charlotte", huh?  <br>Venus fly traps and bacteria are animals now.</br>  <br>We call them vegetables because they look like vegetables.<br>That doesn´t mean we are right.</br></br>  Is it going to ba a school life, or will we have huge fight between scientists and edgy teenagers?  <br>yes</br>  oh boy another show I'm watching that has absolutely shit tier threads  <br>Look at this buttmonkey, I bet you think Pizza is a fruit too.</br>  <br> there is such a thing as an archetypical "vegetable appearance" <br>You just went full retard.<br><br>And also proved me right. <br> You sound like a bunch of middle schoolers </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>True, blacks are rather prominent when it comes down to street violence and shitty governments.<br><br>I would say, though, whites have them beat at war, slavery, and apparently, mass murder.<br>If Slavs count as white, then there isn't much difference when it comes down to street violence, and alcohol abuse.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bacteria are in fact tiny animals though. Like ants.</br>  <br> fact tiny animals <br>seriosly?</br></br>  <br> whites have them beat at war,  <br>You don't think blacks wage war? Why do you think your 1995 map of Africa looks totally different from your 2015 map of Africa? White colonialism has LONG ended.<br> slavery,  <br>Except there are more slaves in Africa now than there are in the rest of the world combined. It's always been this way. Why do you think whites were able to find slaves even for sale on the continent?<br> and apparently, mass murder. <br>Define "mass murder." Do you mean a single individual killing many, many other individuals, or do you mean a government making it their policy to obliterate a certain tribe/ethnicity from the country. Because blacks have done more than their fair share of each.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Are aliens animals? If I kill an alien will it count as murder?  <br>Animals killing animals is not murder you dingus.<br><br>Also my neighbour has been pissing me off lately, better do what animals do to eachother when they're mad.</br></br></br>  <br> Animals killing animals is not murder you dingus. <br>Yes it is, you dongus.

I can barely read your post.</br>  rip kurt cobain  <br> Explain your reasoning that led you to this incorrect conclusion. <br>The conquest of America, WWI, WWII, the Roman Empire expansion, all the wars within Europe, the conquest of Africa, Oceania and parts of Asia, etc...<br><br> Present day culture is merely a continuation of that. <br>Nope, slave trade is one thing, that was practised even in Europe and Asia.<br>The issue with Africa right now is the broken society that was left after the colony.<br>The same issue can be seen in Latin America, though not to the same extent as in Africa, in that their societies are also yet to find a proper compass to follow and are plagued with corruption, agrarian economies with only a few well-off.<br><br> I'm pretty sure that the world record holder for mass murder is black. <br>Well, I've got to admit I was wrong in this one.<br>The top 3 record holders are hispanics, then a brazilian, then a Chinese, then an Afghani, then a Russian/Ukranian and then an American.<br><br>The first black, Moses Sithole, shows up in the 15th position.

You're just selectively listing historical events that you learned about in school.<br><br> The issue with Africa right now is the broken society that was left after the colony. <br> The same issue can be seen in Latin America <br>What's to say that shitskins just don't have the aptitude to build successful civilizations.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Jun is awful with setting. He used to just use the real world or similar settings, like with Air, Clannad, Kanon, even Little Busters (sorta). But once he is given freedom to write setting, they are all bad, make no sense, and add nothing but forced drama to the story.<br><br>This is basically just a worse version of Angel Beats.</br></br></br></br>  <br>true. he should stop writing for anime</br>  <br> That's not reasoning. You're just selectively listing historical events that you learned about in school. <br>Well, do show me some events larger than those I listed and/or that had more people killed.<br><br> What's to say that shitskins just don't have the aptitude to build successful civilizations. <br>In Latin America's case, for most of the part, the governing elites and general the people with economic power have been the "whiter" hispanics. That hasn't changed the fact that their societies have been shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  implying I'm not already here </br>  <br>Just Google the name of any African country or tribe + the word "genocide" or "war"<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwand<wbr>an_Genocide</wbr></br></br>  <br> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unet<wbr>hical_human_experimentation_in_the_<wbr>United_States</wbr></wbr> <br> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kins<wbr>ey_Reports</wbr> <br><br>Wow, really OP? How naive are you? There's also the Geneva Convention, but that doesn't stop the US from torturing suspected 'terrorists' either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Uhhh... I never said blacks haven't committed mass murder, you know?<br><br>Compare any of those with WW2, the conquest of America, or the crimes of the USSR, and that's almost nothing.</br></br></br>  <br> 1940s <br> 1950s <br> ... <br> ... <br> ... <br><br>Do I really need to spell this out for you? Go google "Nuremberg Code" and figure out what and where "Nuremberg" is and why we call the code that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What's to say that shitskins just don't have the aptitude to build successful civilizations. <br><br>Do you understand what's going on in most African countries right now? Do you not understand what the US has done in most Latin American countries right now? Do you not know what's going in Guatemala right now? How far does your head have to be up your own ass to ignore all the bullshit that is going on in those countries right now? Do you not understand what is holding them back? The same thing that holds the US back from advancing: Rich people with too much to lose. <br><br>Many of the countries that colonized those places still have financial interests in those places and never really left. Lots of oil companies have interested in those companies and are, royally, fucking them over. Whenever the US doesn't like some country's government in Latin America the US will fund rebels to remove them. Haiti tried to raise minimum wage, but the US won't let them, because clothing retailers don't want to pay these people more money. <br><br>Maybe it's time to get off /pol/ and go read some real news?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Maybe it's time to get off /pol/ and go read some real news? <br>You need to browse /pol/ more, a lot more.</br></br>  <br>Then, if that's the case, this thread is fucking retarded, because why should something that was decided in Germany apply to the rest of the world?<br><br>That was the point of the thread.</br></br></br>  <br><br>?</br></br>  <br>Edgy.</br>  <br>You only think that because your education has been centered mainly on Western history. Europeans wage war from time to time and we talk about it like crazy because it's so rare. Africans have waged war constantly since the beginning of time and nobody talks about it since it's the normal state of being for the continent.</br>  <br>No, I really don't.</br>  The first episode was good but the second episode gave up the plot and twists too fast. Not really feeling it anymore.  <br>Nao is pathetic. Bitch burdens herself and leaves her awful personality to muh traumas, while not even trying to do anything for her brother, not even trying to cure him perhaps with another power instead of just "saving" (basically enjoying the blackmail, trolling, chasing, etc) of others, making her hypocritic as fuck.<br><br>That arrow should have gotten to her, but then again teleportbro is pretty based.</br></br></br>  <br> because why should something that was decided in Germany apply to the rest of the world? <br>Have you never heard of an international treaty? You are basically as bad as the dumbass writer for this anime.</br></br>  <br>This entire post is full of shit.</br>    <br>Would you consider Classroom Crisis basically says "capitalism is evil"? Or is it actually apologetic for capitalism?</br>  Why the fuck are there niggers on my board?  <br>It's also illegal to kill people anon.</br>  <br> not liking based Yu <br><br>Fuck you, double-faced /a/ sterotype.</br></br></br>  <br> Do you understand what's going on in most African countries right now? <br> Do you not know what's going in Guatemala right now?  <br>Same thing that has ALWAYS gone on in those regions. Africans never even invented the wheel before it was brought to them through trade.<br> Do you not understand what is holding them back? <br>Their genes.</br></br></br></br></br>  Who let the /pol/ out?  <br>Yea, we get it you massive sperg.

There are many ways to kill people legally.</br></br>  <br>Go ahead and disprove it. I'll wait.</br>  Wow it's like I'm really on a troll thread in /int/  <br>Dude, what is wrong with you? First you complain that Japanese writers don't know anything about the Nuremberg Code. <br><br>Then this was posted: <br>The links are lead to unethical experimentations that were done AFTER the Nuremberg Code was created, some done very recently. <br><br>Then you said this: <br> Do I really need to spell this out for you? Go google "Nuremberg Code" and figure out what and where "Nuremberg" is and why we call the code that. <br><br>The treaty was created before the 1950s, but that hasn't stopped people from doing illegal experiments, at all. The Geneva convention hasn't stopped Guantanamo Bay from existing either. <br><br>Then you said: <br> Have you never heard of an international treaty? <br><br>What are you trying to say? The treaty exists, but no one even gives a shit about it as illegal experiments continue to persist.

Showing that there's more to them than what meets the eye. They've got their good side and their bad side. They've got their virtues and flaws. They may preach one thing, but at times act opposite to what they talk. Etc...<br><br>Good and memorable characters always have flaws and keep them.<br>Hell, people talk about Lelouch a lot in these threads, but he had plenty of issues he never worked on and several times made the stupidest mistakes due to those flaws. And that was part of what made him a good and likeable character.<br><br>Character development shouldn't be there to turn a character into a moral-teaching, but to turn it into a person, and people are not perfect, and that's precisely what makes people interesting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean they're paying MC-kun.</br>  <br>This guy gets it.<br><br>Han solo is an arrogant rogue at both the beginning and end of star wars, that's who his character is. But he also develops to care about his friends and maybe a little about the rebellion by the end of the movie, that's his arc. He's still got real defects, but they're the things who make him who he is.<br><br>Anime, especially in the last however many years, doesn't seem to get this. Characters, especially main characters, are all completely flawless except for one quirk, and either that quirk just disappears for no reason once the business of the plot gets underway, or their arc is to iron out that one quirk. Booooriiiing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's his flaw?</br>  The Nazi's founded medical breakthroughs employed today.  <br>Because it's basically a job for him now.</br>  <br> this kind of thing is very illegal <br><br>Never stopped America from doing it extensively.</br></br></br>   love characters with horrible personalities and traits <br> hate characters who get fawned over constantly and could virtually just choose a partner from an unlimited pool of eager hopefuls </br>  That fucking hop.   /pol/ <br><br>The libruls crying about how everything that happened to niggers is white people's fault are also retarded, but this discussion really doesn't belong here.</br></br>  <br>To be fair, this has little to do with /pol/ itself, as you can also found in /pol/ people who derail threads with anime and other topics.<br><br>Not to mention politics and the like have been discussed in /a/ (even it's not related to this board) even before /new/ or /pol/ were made.<br><br>So, it's not as if some /pol/lacks deliberately come here to derail threads, but some people can simply not let some opinions slide and will argue against them regardless of the board, and when it comes down to politics or religion, that happens anywhere.</br></br></br></br></br>  I don't want imouto to turn into a vegetable.  <br> What other anime has human experimentation? <br>Elfen lied.

The origin of the powers is most likely supernatural and linked to the titular girl. Magneto wants some of that, Xavier says you cant have and the whole plot gets rolling.  <br><br>What kind of excuse is that ?</br></br>  Reminder that imouto will have powers and will be taken by the government.

Alas, it only works on men.</br>   What did you say anon? You don't have any friends and never leave your room? Oh, I feel sorry for you.   <br>Not as good as Kana Asumi.</br>  <br>But it was imouto, and imouto is great.</br>  <br>no sorry, the character being cute does not excuse the tone-shattering transition</br>  <br>They made her ultra hyperactive only to mindbreak her later</br>  Not sure if I'm the only one thinking this...but I really think Charlotte has a shitload of doujin potential.<br><br>I'm already thinking about having invisible sex with Nao, for one.

Imagine what it's like in places outside of FDA's power. That was my point. We don't know, and my bet is on it being a lot worse.<br><br> In general, the FDA only really governs those who seek to get its approval to sell prescription drugs/treatments.  <br>This is true, alongside medical devices (that's where I work specifically). But again, that's my point. Pharmaceuticals and ME equipment barely scratches the surface of medical research, and yet in these two areas alone there is already overwhelming evidence to suggest common unethical behavior.<br><br> And the FDA is also not in Japan. <br>Indeed. I was speaking from personal experience only. From what I've garnered regulations are a little bit stricter there, and I'd be inclined to believe that the Japanese government isn't as eager to devalue human lives in the same way the US does. But again, who knows?<br><br>I was just trying to point out how using the Nuremberg Code as "proof" that unethical behavior in science and medicine doesn't happen is absolute an utter bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>also to add to this, I understand the need to brighten up the mood but this character is just way too much sometimes</br>  How the fuck did archer make the picture? <br><br>Does he eats material for the picture for lunch and he shit it out of his stomach anytime he wants?</br></br>  <br> The doujins from this show will be so delicious. <br>There won't be any.</br></br>  <br>Too much for you to handle?

Most of the users are teenagers.</br>  First Natsun and now this qt. I'm so madly in love with sakura ayane.  <br> bawwww MC is not gary stu anymore </br>  <br>That is completely irrelevant and everyone who has used Pixiv knows it.</br>  Human experimentation's fine but be a little more top secret about it, fuck. They're pretending like it's just this thing that happens and the government and the west don't care, when really the un would shit down their throats for this shit if they found out. That's just anime though, japan gives no fucks about plausibility.  <br>Nice meme</br>  <br>he is much better now</br>  <br>Then what is a good reprensentative of doujins? I got pretty unlucky last session. I dropped Danmachi and amagi right after few episodes because they are shit and they got so much doujins out of it.  Doesnt stop me from faping though </br>  <br>Yes it did, and does, you tinfoiler.</br>  <br>He went from being a humorously petty megalomaniac to the straight man, it's a clear downgrade.</br>  <br>Indeed.</br>  <br> when really the un would shit down their throats for this shit if they found out <br><br>Wondering where the throat shitting occurred after the CIA torture report was released.<br><br>Or hell, where was the throat shitting Israel's been deserving for about 20 years now?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Once you get to a certain level, most scientists are immoral people who see "ethics" as a petty superstition. Of course, they don't believe humans have anything like a "soul", so torturing and killing what are in their eyes just clever animals doesn't really seem like that big a deal. I'm pretty sure that the only time they even pretend to entertain the idea of "ethics" is when they want to shit all over religion for supposedly holding back what they call progress.</br></br>  <br> the UN <br> doing shit <br> Also, it's not like Nao has any proof of what she is talking about aside from her mentally unstable brother who might as well be like that because of completely different reasons.</br></br></br>  <br>Every single word in existence that can be used to describe black people is "discriminatory". It's ridiculous.</br>  <br> You talk as if scientists weren't human beings too.<br> Most people choose that carreer because they like investigating or just want to give something good to humanity, not because they are Joseph Mengele.</br></br>  <br>Every country does and will continue to do immoral shit to their enemies in wars but doing it to innocent first world kids is completely different</br>  Wait, charlotte is voiced by Iroha?<br><br>picked up</br></br>  <br>well said brother. Dont let these fools misguide us. Our work will be the future of whole mankind</br>  <br>In my country, the traditional word for Ns was fine, but is now increasingly being equated with the English "nigger", and is not politically correct anymore.</br>  <br> Its all really a metaphor for individualism vs. society anyways <br><br>Is that what you got out of Episode One? If so, then you seem to think that the MC wasn't all that bad by cheating on exams. The things the MC did was not an illustration of an individual refusing to conform to society. He seemed to want to be part of society - the rich successful part. But he was willing to cheat, steal, put people at risk of losing their life, assault, etc. The MC has been a selfish uncaring unapologetic thug so far. <br><br>Even when caught he had no remorse.</br></br></br></br></br>  Why did everyone decide they are "evil" scientists? Maybe they actually thought improving that jamming signal thingy would be of more benefit to humanity than the life of some fucking loser who didn't do shit with his life apart from playing in his "band".<br> I mean, they are certainly fucked up and unethical, but so far it doesn't seem like they are doing it for selfish purposes or just because they enjoy tormeting teenagers.</br>  <br>Since Eichmann, we know evil people merely do their job, instead of being lunatic freaks.</br>  <br> they're just true neutral :^) </br>  He's composing.  Who is Charlotte?  <br>the mom</br>  <br><br>*I'm best Idoru, kira~!</br></br>  <br> Not being able to recognize at the get go. </br>  <br>The girl on the water.</br>    <br><br>I'm not talking about "most scientists" here, but the ones on the cutting edges, doing the big things. We are just lucky that most of the things these people do today doesn't have to do with researching on humans, and those that want to are held back by laws. Look at the views of Francis Crick, for example. Look at how Richard Dawkins, whose only original idea is the "extended phenotype" (the "selfish gene" idea was already around, he just made a metaphor that was in any case inaccurate) but who has the attitude of a tyrant in all matters on which he cares to opine and thinks of those who disagree with him as worms. Einstein and Hawking both ignored their family's because science was more important to them. Once scientists get in the public eye, they tend to start viewing non-scientists as little more than ants.</br></br>    The imouto needs to blaze it.   eating inside a train <br>Fuck this bitch.</br>  I saw this more as a technology versus nature thing, because if you noticed so far all the big bads are people in the field of science and technology. While all the good people with their special powers are victims of circumstances such as Idoh who had to take dirty pictures because of money.<br><br>It just screams liberal garbage in the end and I'm willing to drop it by the third episode if it doesn't shake things up otherwise I can see the ending already where it will be like minority report where the "system" will be shut down.<br><br>Personally I don't see anything wrong with what the scientist did because the pursuit of knowledge and technology is always a good thing and progresses humanity. Otherwise you get places like... well Africa and Somalia where technology and science and intelligence is shun upon. Now think about what would happen if the people had super powers and the behavior of the chimps of Africa and Somalia? Japan and the world would soon enough become Africa and Somalia.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gladly.</br>  <br>Which is more frowned upon in Japan: eating or holding a gangbang in a train?</br>  <br>Posting on 4chan with mobile.</br>  <br>I'm sure it's only a thing with biologists, though. Chemists and physicists are also scientists, but they are rarely as 'unethical' as biologists, so to speak.<br><br>Also, Dawkins is a terrible example. If you read his tweets you'll realize he's a fucking twat, even by biology standards.</br></br></br>  <br>Eating.</br>  <br><br>Hey its that guy from the Gate thread who streams his anime.</br></br>  <br>There are passenger trains specifically for gangbangs and molestation.<br>I ask you, are there any trains exclusively tasked to hold people who rudely eating their food?</br></br>  <br><br>Yet he has been lionized and made into one of the most well-known scientists living today.</br></br>  <br>Have they never heard of the human rights in USA?</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>It's not illegal if he wrote a release.</br>  <br>You're under two serious misapprehensions. First, that works of fiction must always match reality 100%. Second, that just because something's hideously unethical and tremendously illegal, governments and other organisations don't still do it.</br>  Why do people hate the anime?  <br>moar 4chan</br>  It was a mistake to post in this thread.  <br>Sure.</br>  <br>Anno please.<br>Also if you fuck up 3+1 same way you did with 3.33 I'm going to be very angry and complain loudly on anonymous image board.</br></br>    Sad Panda thread<br><br>Some random stuff<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/551373/1dabfa<wbr>2be4/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/623067/ea9312<wbr>a88b/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/723516/c1bf81<wbr>f7b1/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/649737/6e1d27<wbr>51d2/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/816242/48be31<wbr>d8a2/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/824091/0f4905<wbr>25d3/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/821185/1ec1f9<wbr>9dd2/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/631092/a27846<wbr>e642/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/315846/fcff5e<wbr>fb58/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/687306/f1c6e3<wbr>6aba/</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br> Wild Horse </br>  http://exhentai.org/g/831130/66e95e<wbr>793a/</wbr>   Two 3DPD mango in front page <br><br>Why is this allowed?</br></br>  <br> 3DPD Mango <br>Huh?</br></br>  Holy fucking shit my dick<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/831103/62c53d<wbr>6a77/</wbr></br></br>  Do any of you guys just not fap anymore? <br><br>These days I just read these lewd doujins and enjoy them for their art.

Why would anyone use anything other than Gelbooru or the panda if you want lots of images?</br>  <br> Gelbooru <br>Reminds me that the admin or whoever bans scat, too. I'm not into that kind of thing, it's just odd that he has a hang-up over that when there's lots of guro, bestiality, and whatnot.</br></br>  <br>limited tags, server timeouts, and now a loli ban.<br>never using this shit again</br></br>  <br>With paheal it was mostly the enjoyment of working through everything and finding unexpected fap material. But the cons are outweighing the pros now, I likely will just mainline gelbooru now instead.</br>  <br> not removing the shitiest tag ever </br>  <br>Then why is NTR still allowed?</br>  <br>This. They're my main go-to sites. <br><br> There's a third site I use, one that hasn't had any purges over copyright. I won't name it, though.  </br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Last Sunday (5th of July) and Tuesday (7th of July) I got notifications of "indexing"/"blacklisting" by 2 European countries and one South American country. This is on top of the constant notifications from the Russians that an IP block is on the horizon. <br><br>banning shit because of eurotrash, spics, and russians. let them fight their own government if they want that shit, no need to cave like a faggot, and punish the rest of the sane world.</br></br></br>  <br> sane world <br><br>Anon...</br></br></br>  Loli is for degenerates.<br><br>I, for one, am glad this is happening.</br></br>  <br>Go home Carlos</br>  <br>They probably (and with good reason) believe that the "sane" (protip: no) countries would follow suit.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Sqr<wbr>7GENUVbQ</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>ur gay</br>   There are people who don't just use Danbooru with the addon.   <br> sane world </br>  <br>Your containment board is calling for you. </br>  <br>Then why the fuck would you bother bringing it up?</br>  <br>(posting for the record)</br>  <br>He's a real tease.</br>  <br>To point out that there are alternate sites just as good as the panda, and don't require any pointless hoops to jump through to actually get to the content. Our secret club is now thoroughly unnecessary, and I wish you the best of luck in figuring out how.</br>  Wait a second. So if Booru finds that you uploaded loli in the past theyre going to report you to the authorities now?<br><br>Holy shit?...That cant be right.</br></br>  <br>If loli going to get banned in the west, they'll have to do it over my cold dead frozen body. Lolicon/shotacon legalization movement when?</br>  <br> implying sjw are banning your lolis <br>sjw are opposed to christfags.<br>Christfags are the ones banning your lolis.<br>sjw just don't give a shit about your lolis.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but you would disguise it under something else. Something more broad and general. Not specifically loli.</br>  18 U.S. Code § 2257<br><br>`(h) In this section--<br><br> `(1) the term `actual sexually explicit conduct' means actual but not simulated conduct as defined in clauses (i) through (v) of section 2256(2)(A) of this title;<br><br> `(2) the term `produces'--<br><br> `(A) means--<br><br> `(i) actually filming, videotaping, photographing, creating a picture, digital image, or digitally- or computer-manipulated image of an actual human being;<br><br> actual but not simulated <br> of an actual human being <br>im confused, why do all these laws have to be so broad and contradictory</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>SJW's consider drawn loli basically the same as 3D loli faggot, they think you're all rapist patriarchal peods.</br></br>  <br>so people with money, power or friends can reasonably weasel out of the negative consequences while those without will more then likely get fucked.</br>  <br>I think I know. It starts with a p I believe. Am I right?</br>  <br>Yeah but that interface. I prefer ex's.</br>  <br>just move to fucking Japan.</br>  <br> Wanting to live with elevens </br>  just move to sankaku complex my friend. ;)  <br> 10 years later <br> Japan's AoC is 18 <br> lolicon finally gets banned <br> lolicon banned worldwide <br> next to be banned: violent videogames <br> There is no way to escape this hell now.... </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's always one way</br>  <br> NOTICE: IF YOUR ACCOUNT IS FOUND TO CONTAIN ILLEGAL ACTIVITY, OR ANY ILLEGAL FILES, YOUR ACCOUNT WILL BE TERMINATED IMMEDIATELY, WITHOUT NOTICE.

Then they will ban &lt;16 drawings. Then anime becomes illegal in most countries.

I just like the porn of the series.<br><br>It's what makes it redeemable. At least to me.<br>That happens a lot with series I don't like, funny enough.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm the same way with To Love Ru, never even read the thing but some of the doujins are pretty great</br>  <br> in two decades time, maybe less, politicians will be degenerates from the internet <br>can't wait, shame I'll be dead of an heart attack or lung cancer by then</br></br>  <br>Yea, like the new Doronjo.</br>  <br>shotacon detetced</br>  <br><br> sexualizing the leopard <br><br>I mean that's why I picked up night as well, but she wasn't sexualized at all in it, I enjoyed the show a lot nonetheless.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, until I saw those Mikan doujins, I never even cared for To Love Ru.<br>And that brown girl too.</br></br>  All hail the Ara Ara master race.  I'm a pedophile and loli is my therapy.  <br>This, I don't even really like loli but this still concerns me.</br>  <br> Booru Project WILL NOTIFY THE PROPER AUTHORITIES OF YOUR ACTIONS.  <br>Booru is working with the party van, shieet.</br></br>  <br>I think it's more that the US is one of the few countries where the constitution has actual legal weight and must be respected by the courts, hence they are forced to abide when it says something is a right.<br><br>Like, lots of countries have amendments stating the right to bear arms, but it's ignored and laws are very strict, but in the US, they can't ignore the constitution.<br><br>Not that the powers that be aren't trying their damndest to whittle away on that constitution though.</br></br></br></br></br>   tfw bullying pedos   <br>I feel bad for pedos, most have never, and will never, sexually assault a child, yet society treats every pedophile as an active sexual predator or ticking timebomb.</br>  <br> implying that /ss/ isn't the master race </br>  <br>And none can come forward and get help without their life getting ruined.</br>  <br> none can come forward and get help <br>What? What do they need help with, other than with finding a new site to view loli porn as more sites are being pressured to remove it.</br></br>  <br>Feel no mercy for degenerates</br>  <br>if somebody comes forward looking for help, you should fucking help them if they've committed no crimes<br>Putting the moral argument of sexualizing/ having sex with children aside, they really should be respected more than they are. <br> I think I'm a pedo what do I do <br> Did somebody say pedo? CALLING THE COPS </br></br></br></br>  <br> pot calling the kettle black <br> "first they came for the jews but I didn't stand up for them etc. etc. etc. then they came for me and nobody was left to stand up for me" <br>Your and idiocy.</br></br></br>  <br>Boo hoo go cry over your kiddy diddlers while the police plan to raid your house and find your pedo ring</br>  <br>pixiv.net r-18 ロリ<br>this isn't hard you guys</br></br>  wow this has absolutely zero impact on me<br><br>call me when sad panda and sankaku channel start purging loli, I don't give a fuck if mainstream sites cave in<br><br>already have a shit ton of pics saved up already anyway, the entire internet could be scraped clean of loli porn and I'd still have more than I could ever fap to in my life on my external</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're browsing /a/, fucking autistic retard.<br>You're the definition of a degenerate. You need to be thrown in jail to protect society and yourself from your own raging ass burgers. You have no place condemning other groups of people you know nothing about and have no intention of understanding.</br></br>  <br>No, fuck you.<br>People who have not harmed others should not be vilified and persecuted.<br><br>Someone rape a kid for real, I'll join you in breaking their legs, but there are NO victims with lolis.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The ring?</br>  <br>I would go invisible and just do lewd things to people<br>Like I'd just randomly flip skirts or grab butts</br></br>  <br>But those are wrong things to do.</br>  <br>From my perspective, not flipping skirts is wrong.</br>  <br>Don't let it tempt you, the ring has a will of it's own, it wants to be found, to return back to Saur- I mean the police.</br>  <br><br>Wait, is it chaika?</br></br>  <br>I know this is probably supposed to be a le funny ironic joke but this is actually true. Masturbating to 'loli' = supporting rape culture without paying. Masturbating to real 3D children being raped = at least you are financially supporting the child's empowerment (both financial and sexual) and one day she/he can too be a strong feminist like me.</br>  <br>One could argue for anime being representative of actual human beings.</br>  <br>The gubmint was always against encryption.<br>Hell, it was illegal to use encryption algorithms a while back.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, so?<br>So why can't pedos jerk it to little drawn girls, so they don't go out fucking actual children?</br></br>  Honestly speaking, not stating it as something good or bad, pedophilia will probably go through the same acceptance movement that everything else is going through at some point unless some far-right party takes over the country.  <br><br>Hey, a while back rot'ing and xor'ing the results was top notch encryption.</br></br>  <br>What's your stance on third wave feminism, because you kinda sound like one of those.</br>  <br> exhentai <br> checking... <br> found: 0 <br><br>Please help a brother out?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The simulated part seems to indicate that it's fine as long as it's not ACTUAL actual.</br>  <br>No it won't. Maybe 3D pedophilia will, but lolicon will stay illegal forever because feminists do actually think that drawings are worse than the real thing. You see, if real pedophilia was legal, men would still be forced to spent big money competing for best underage pussy. Being showered in money and gifts is considered empowering and so is having your cunt filled by multiple older men (for money).<br><br>If men masturbate to drawings online, they are eschewing money from the women (and ultimately, from the Judea, which is why feminism is supported by the Judea). That's why all of lolicon and hentai will be inevitably banned all around the world eventually.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure they'll ever be fine to be with minors (well, that depends on if consent laws change in the future, but probably not enough), but I think it would be good if society came to the conclusion that most pedos aren't actually monsters.<br><br>I mean, still be wary with your kids, but in real life, there's not a pedo behind every corner, and even if there was, 95% of all pedos know that it would be wrong, and/or that there are serious consequences in preying on children.<br><br>I think it would be a huge load off society's mind (and government spending), if people stopped being so hysteric about pedophiles.<br>And also didn't conflate pedos with hebes and ephebos.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   ITT: Pedos that don't know what exhentai is <br> "B-but 2d doesn't translate to 3d" <br> By that logic fapping to hairy bara doesn't make you gay </br></br>  <br>The tittle is right there.</br>  <br> `(i) actually [...] creating a picture [...] of an actual human being. <br>This seems to imply that it doesn't matter whether it's a real person or a representation of a real person.<br><br>It's up to the judge to rule it whichever way he likes.</br></br></br></br>  Anyone here watching this show?  she dies  Followed when it was airing.

I know the Marcia case was solved, but all those exposition about the stuff I mentioned are irrelevant at the end.

He used Dark Rebellion's effect twice. Do you even understand what is going on?</br></br>   Jean getting BTFO after failing to capture Yugo and Yuzu     YAMEROOOOO  <br>I think you are confusing /arc-v/ with /dng/.</br>  <br>He's a big guy.</br>  <br>a new duelist thrown out of nowhere, calling it!</br>  What was that OST that was playing when it was Yuya's turn and he took Jack down to 300?  そんな遊矢のもとに、一人の少年がカードを手に現れる…。<br>Yuya gonna get some cards from new boy</br>  <br> Astro and Chrono's Pendulum effects <br>Anime versions only work if there's a Pendulum monster involved, which Rune-Eyes and Dark Rebellion are not.<br><br> Rune-Eyes' protection effect <br>Doesn't exist in the anime, in exchange for an additional multi attack effect<br><br> Dark Rebellion's effect <br>Anime version can use its effect twice in a row, but doesn't get to keep ATK bonus</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was pretty interesting that bracelet-kun was beating like a heartbeat, but didn't teleport anyone just yet.<br><br>So as long as Yuzu keeps her distance, Yugo and Yuya can exist at the same time.  Then Yuya'll proceed to nom Yugo. </br></br></br>  <br>I want to give him a hug, he is suffering.</br>  <br>Oh Bahsaka will be joining us now</br>  <br>What?</br>  why is yuya jobbing  <br>He tried to match Jack power vs power, and it doesn't work because Jack's too overwhelming when it comes to brute force</br>  <br>People really aren't keeping up with the real card game. I think most people are too stuck on his old perception when his deck was utter shit.</br>  And Yuya's entertainment dueling still isn't called out. Mainly cause he didn't even entertain duel in the first place. Why are the summaries so misleading?  <br>Because they want you to buy DOCS for Scarright</br>  <br>Why are they all covering their eyes?<br><br>Why is the left eye always covered in this show, including Reira's and Serena's monsters and Leo's device?</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Only time the MC have a good Deck <br> &gt; Change it Already <br> Fuck off <br>Maybe if he actually played Performapals it'd be a good deck but as of now he's just using them as tribute fodder to summon DRAGONS.<br><br>Either go full dragons or go home, don't do this half-assed shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I can't wait for this   Jeans men tries to capture Yuzu <br> Other security organisation makes them BTFO </br>  <br>But Jack called him out on his entertainment dueling<br> don't you dare to insult my dad's dueling <br>he went, in his thoughts.</br></br></br>  <br>yes this<br>some of the Yuya EM dun even is pendulum monster</br></br>  <br>Did you not see the preview?</br>  Why is Jean still trying to arrest Yuzu and Yugo? Council clearly already gave them a free pass so he should've known that they'd step in and wag their finger at him if he tried to pull any shit on them.  <br>someone plz answer</br>  <br><br>I did, and I know Yuya was pissed about the whole dissing on his dueling style, but Yuya was hardly in his entertainer mode.</br></br>  <br>Anon, just a couple episodes ago the Entermates were the MVP</br>  <br>Yeah, he is definitely going to side with Academia, not having all the power must feel terrible.</br>  <br>Yuya is ALWAYS in entertainment mode, even if he doesn't go ladies and gentlemen.</br>  <br>Ah... his anime effect....<br><br>But then its 2 xyz mats for the boost.</br></br></br>  Red Resonator<br>Fiend-type<br>Tuner<br>When this card is successfully Special Summon, target 1 Synchro monster on the Field: increase your LP by monster's ATK.</br></br></br>  <br>It wasn't full-on ladies and gentlemen, but he also only had 1 turn like Jack predicted. And was in dragons mode</br>  <br> But then its 2 xyz mats for the boost. <br>That's the IRL effect. Anime effect is 1 mat but you can spam it twice in a row like Yuya always does.</br></br>  <br><br>He probably one of those "racist" type of villain</br></br>  TIME TO GIT GUD<br><br> Also Yuya said in the preview something like 'How dare Jack walk over his dad entertainment dueling style' </br></br>  <br><br>I keep up with the real card game . The only good thing they can do is to gave him the "Master Of Pendulum" structure deck with Sky Arc and all of the Magician . No MC changed "deck theme" . <br>Yugi = Magician ? <br>Judai = E-Hero<br>Yusei = Synchron / Stardust deck<br>Yuma = idk , shit tier series <br>Yuya = Entermate because MUH EGAO</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Judai changed from e-heroes to neos.</br>  <br>Yusei was Junk<br>Yuma was...Future Number? kinda like yugi and Silents</br></br>  <br>Yugi's deck is considered a Strategy deck.</br>  <br>Should I be this attracted to a 14 year old manlet?</br>  <br> Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon got punted down to 2500 at the end of the turn? <br>DRXD anime effect works on lvl5 and higher monsters for 1 unit then atk resets on end phase<br><br>  Timegazer and Stargazer's effects didnt happen. <br>Negate Spell/Traps that target PENDULUM monsters<br><br>Rune eyes doesnt have protection in the anime</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Red Sprinter<br>Fiend-type<br>If this is the only monster you control, you can Special Summon 1 Level 3 or lower Tuner monster from your hand.</br></br>  <br>And lo and behold, he performed better in those duels.<br><br>Just goes to show that edgy dragons are cramping his style. He needs to ditch that shit fast and stop going for big plays with dragons if he wants to stop getting BTFO'd by the likes of Reiji and Jack.</br></br></br>  Yuzu's outfit is meh.  <br> Yuma <br><br>HOPPU, HOPPU, HOPPU, HOPPU,  HOPPU </br></br></br>  Red Resonator<br>Fire Fiend / Tuner / Effect<br>LV2 600/200<br>You can only use the (2) effect of “Red Resonator” once per turn. (1) When this card is Normal Summoned: You can Special Summon 1 Level 4 or lower monster from your hand. (2) When this card is Special Summoned: You can target 1 face-up monster; gain LP equal to its current ATK.</br></br></br>  <br>Those were Rin's originally.</br>  <br> strategy <br>well that pic is somewhat considered to be a playable but Yugi never had repeated monsters in his deck.</br></br>  <br>Yuya is trying to fight power with power, but you can't beat the KINGU'S ABSOLUTE POWER FLAME</br>  <br> Rin just happened to have pink-colored clothes for her alternate dimension counterpart to wear even though she was a poorfag that only ever wore green in flashbacks and probably couldn't afford extra color schemes </br>  Phantasy Star Online 2 TV anime announced, coming 2016  http://phantasystar.sega.jp/psporta<wbr>l/pso15anniversary/animation/</wbr>  <br>And the English version is never coming.

Posting best grill to celebrate this  <br> Best girl <br>That will never show, because its going to be original story, right?</br></br>  <br><br><br>At this point most of the people already hope it doesn't come out in the west, since they are already playing it on their servers with a pretty good fan-translated english patch. <br><br>If it really did come out, everyone in the west would be IP blocked (happened to the SEA version).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It did. In SEA.</br>  It's gonna be absolute shit.<br><br>No anime based from a game has ever been good.</br></br>  <br>If they put at least as much effort as they did in Episode 2, it might be okay.</br>  <br>SEA player here, the "translations" are shit.<br>The game is also bullshit now, SH has 30% more damage than in JP for whatever reason.<br>Some of the costumes have crazy ass augs like 100% rare drop and can only be bought through scratch completion(which is illegal in Japan).<br><br>Everything is expensive, AC hairstyle prices are reaching 150mill a pop.</br></br></br></br></br>  Best girl that will wear that in the anime.  <br>It just means they won't follow the matterboard story, but what kind of story the anime will have is up in the air.</br>   Any anon still playing the game?   <br>Never wear that*</br>   game adaptation <br><br>NOTHING COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG</br></br>  <br>This couldn't be more wrong congratz on being the faggiest.</br>  I never asked for this   tfw its SoL   <br>Nah, it's gonna be as chuuni as blazblue.</br>  I want Lisa to step on me  Taking bets on just how bad this is gonna be.

The translation was awful and changed up a lot of terminology that's been a standard in the series. On top of that, they started with PSO2 vanilla when Japan was already well into Episode 2.<br><br>By vanilla PSO2, I mean before ANY updates were made, including being able to have more than one character per ship without paying and no Braver class.</br></br></br>  <br>If only.<br><br>We still haven't gotten an SoL anime about MMORPG players. Shit would be glorious.</br></br></br>  <br>SEA is on Episode 2 now.<br>The names are weird though, Quna is Kuhna.<br>Funny Traitor costume is changed to Jolly Turncoat which leads to confusion as the costume related weapon is still named Traitor Linear.<br>Border Break is changed to Beyond Boundaries.<br><br>Though players are still in a steady decline.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> SoL anime about MMORPG players <br>Oh god I want this so much.</br></br>  <br> Most of the characters are well adjusted people. <br> One of the characters is a neet who basically plays the game 24/7 <br> He's the main source of drama in the anime <br> The anime is an attempt to un-NEET viewers <br> Funded by the government </br></br></br></br></br>   implying it won't be yet another generic "wow I'm stuck in the game" anime   <br>Japan's on Episode 3.
