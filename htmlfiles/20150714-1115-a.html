Entering the grand line with a fleet of ships is pretty reasonable. Trying to steal Zeff journal is vile but smart.</br>  <br> Killer <br> Not kawaii <br>Get a load of this nigga</br></br></br>  <br>well SOMEONE doesn't know Killer's character very well</br>  <br>The anime is probably not a good way to see the actual proportions of characters</br>  <br><br>And yet they were weak as fuck. Krieg couldn't do crap without his weapons and Mihawk would have finished him off anyway.</br></br>  <br>I agree which is why Killer might be Kuina pulling a Mulan.</br>   Iwata from Nintendo is dead   <br>People followed Hitler as well anon. alot of them</br>  <br> starved almost to death immediately before fight the straw hats and the Baratie crew. <br>This was Krieg 20 mins before the fight began and than in the fight.<br><br>Luffy defeated a severely weakened Don Krieg, and still only "won" because Sanji pulled him from the sea. Without help Luffy died and Krieg was only KOd.<br>Being starved almost to death immediately following being attacked by Mihawk (who was still pursuing him and showed up) is no joke.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why was Mihawk chasing after Don Krieg?<br><br>Was there ever an explanation?</br></br></br>  <br><br>He was bored.</br></br>  <br>Stop lying to me.</br>  <br>Either they interrupted his nap like Zeff said or he really was just bored</br>  <br>stress finally got him, huh? rest in pieces motherfucker</br>  <br> implying you don't want to suck Doffys dick </br>    <br>fake and gay</br>  <br><br>Mihawk himself said that he had time to kill<br><br>kek</br></br></br></br>  <br>it was literally cancer</br>  <br>No you</br>  <br>I now realize... The Heart Pirates had no idea what their captain had been doing until they read the daily paper. I wonder how they reacted to the sudden alliance with the Strawhats.</br>    <br>I want the KidHawPoo alliance to meet the StrawHearts. I want it to be crazy.</br>  <br>yep. At 55. Stress doesnt help those kinds of things. Exacerbates them really</br>  so I know it's cool right now to hate on Dressarosa buuut<br><br>After reading it all in one go I think Law's flashback might be the best one in the manga so far</br></br>  <br>only faggots with shit taste hate on Dressrosa</br>  <br>Only Marinefordbabies hate on Dressrosa.<br><br>That too</br></br></br>  <br>Yes. They woke Mihawk up while he slept.</br>  <br> Apoo meets Brook </br>  <br>Apoo is the weirdest motherfucker in one piece, and that's saying something. Wish we got him as a potential ally for Luffy instead of either Drake, Capone, or Bonney.</br>   there is literally a fishman version of the Red Hair pirates   <br> no Steve <br><br>eh. It's not the same</br></br></br>  <br>he really is or close to it<br><br>there's always hope that Shanks knocks some sense into the alliance and they ll go play nice with Luffy.<br><br>Well maybe not Kid but Apoo and Hawkins seem to have at least SOME sense</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it looks nice imo, but the fact that the jolly roger is in his fuching hat makes me feel that is fake as fuck (I know WB did something simmilar with the tats but i think it was because of ace and oda decided do do it to the rest of the crew)</br>  <br>Cute as fuck.</br>  <br>Steve? Which one's that?</br>  <br>the one behind Yasopp being too busy bickering with the monkey to look intimidating</br>  <br>Well there is some sort of picture on his hat, whatever it is.</br>  <br> No girl on the team <br><br>Why is Shanks so alpha?</br></br></br>  <br> the guy with the dragon tattoo is actually a myhtical zoan type: dragon <br> yfw </br></br>  <br>Steve</br>  <br><br>God, just compare those two images. Toei has nothing on Oda.</br></br>  <br> Why is Shanks so alpha? <br><br>you mean  why is Shanks so gay? </br></br></br>  Will we ever see Pappug again?  <br><br><br>I only just realized all the swords in the background. I wonder how big of an army Shanks has, even with his one ship.</br></br></br>  <br>How is he gay if he had a baby with the hottest chick in East-o Blue??</br>  <br>I just realized that too.<br><br>God bless colored pages god bless batoto.</br></br></br>  <br> That's Dragon's child though </br>  <br>Luffy is though</br>  <br>  No its not.  </br>  <br>it's Luffy's new baby brother</br>  <br>that has got to be the fattest neck I have ever seen</br>  <br> Yes it is </br>  <br>You're so dumb.</br>  <br>prepare yourself, anon<br><br>im about to blow your mind<br><br>tw:neck mountain</br></br></br></br></br>    law was such an autist. look at him. who does that.  <br>Second you mean ( stole my pic)<br><br>Mind you, the anime goes overborad with all that kind of shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes<br><br>Oda can't have introduced Noah without it becoming important later so we'll see Fishman Island again</br></br></br>  <br>no you<br><br> it's not like Shanks just had the time to visit Makino.   On the other hand, no one knows how to track Dragon's movements </br></br></br>  <br>Worst? You must mean best.</br>  <br><br> fat necks <br><br>Disgusting.</br></br></br></br>  <br> they still still wanted to save Law <br><br>Law was surrounded by a bunch of fuck boys.</br></br></br>  <br> all these children are dead now </br>  <br> Captain got married and didnt even tell us! </br>  <br>shit is pretty dark if you think about it like that. oda just massacred a bunch of kids in this flashback. has he killed any kids before this?</br>  <br>Oda had some stairs beat Kuina to death</br>  <br>I'm sure there were kids on Ohara.</br>  <br>oh yeah. forgot about her. at least hers was accidental and not homicide. <br><br>inb4 she was killed by her dad</br></br></br>  <br>She committed suicide.</br>  Look at how nice this ship is. Easily one of the most advanced and rich ships to date in the story.<br>It is from Norland's homeland.</br>  <br>but anon, killer is dead</br>  <br> never did play that game. almost got it during the sale though </br>  <br>Ship technology doesn't seem to have changed much in 20 years. <br><br>Although Whitey Bay's icebreaker probably didn't exist back then.</br></br></br>  <br>Is that ship only 20 years or is it from Norlands time? I thought the latter.</br>  <br><br>She was killed by Wado Ichimonji because it chose Zoro as its wielder.<br>Ryuuma states that this is the truth of all legendary blades, "cursed" ones are just picky swords.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Wado chose stairs.</br></br>  <br>She died because she tried to hold a sword between her breasts</br>    <br>That fact that it looks "nice" is what makes it fake. We all know it will be another Oda absurd design no one will like at first.</br>  bump  <br>His body got bigger</br>  <br>I bet that dude is some kinda shark df just useless in the water! Oh the comedy!</br>  <br><br>she just pretended to be dead to join the revolutionaries (and becoming a man) without getting his dad and dojo pals in deep shit</br></br>  <br> trusting Toei </br>  <br>people die</br>  <br> Luffy defeated a severely weakened Don Krieg <br>I'm seeing a lot of people (or maybe just one) suggesting that Kreig was especially strong for some reason.

No idea why.</br>    <br>Sorry to post something from the anime, but the voice acting is just wonderful<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RZ9<wbr>ZWo9BUOw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry, the anime wasn't shit yet then</br>  <br>Yes it was. The anime turned to shit after Alabasta. It's only that it gets shittier and shittier.</br>  <br>If that was shit then what is it now?</br>  <br>i'd say it turned to shit right when alabasta started</br>  <br>I'd argue it went to shit sometime after Saboady or Impel Down. I'm not saying it was the best before that but it certainly wasn't that bad.</br>  Why do I get the feeling nobody in Shanks crew has devil fruit powers?

Don't take it seriously.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> italian names <br>Monkey D. Rubber <br>Asop<br>Re dei Cecchini = Sogeking<br>Renny Renny Chopper = Chopper<br>Barbabianca = Whitebeard<br>Barbanera = Blackbeard</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I fucking love how in the italian version they called him Rubber for something like forever and when the 'D.' thing became important they rectified by making him say 'my real name is Monkey D. Luffy, Rubber for my friends'. Fucking imbeciles.<br><br>Barbabianca and Barbanera fit, I mean, it's the literal translation. Asop is just plain dumb. Chopper too.</br></br></br>  <br> femininity is disgusting <br>you said it, fag, not us</br></br>  <br>It's disgusting when translators ruin stories, I heard in A Song of Ice and Fire they changed the deer (Stag to represent the Baratheons) that was dead at the start into a unicorn.</br>  <br> finnish names <br>Sogeking = Ampunaamio<br>Saldeath = A. Pina<br>Valkoparta<br>Mustaparta</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why the fuck would they call him 'Rubber' ? Like, I know some guys in OP has powers that match their names but fucking Rubber ?<br><br>And I can never understand why translations and stuff change the Names of characters. I mean, it's a name, not a 'word', you know ? I mean, if you're called John, you're probably going to be called John every where else too. Maybe the pronunciation might change a little but you won't turn into Josephine the 3rd all of a sudden.</br></br></br>  <br>He's a man, you gaylord. If you like someone with a dick doing feminine poses, then the faggot is you</br>  <br>Isn't 'A Song of Ice and Fire' the book ? i.e Canon ?</br>  <br>Yes but when translated into a new language the translators have the nerve to change what the author said and create potential plotholes.</br>  <br>yes, I just reread it and they decided to translate it as 'il rostro mutilato di un unicorno' (the mangled rostrum of an unicorn). What the fuck were they thinking?<br><br><br>because translators are fucking retarded that's why. Rubber... Fucking Rubber.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But anon, that's the anime. In the manga luffy is rufy and everyone else's name bar white/black/brownbeard is unchanged</br>  <br>Oh, derp, the translation. For some stupid reason, I thought G.R.R Martin wrote it as a Unicorn. My bad.</br>  Whitebeard is a translation too.  <br>that's true, but as a kid I came to know and like One Piece by watching the anime, so for years it was Rubber to me until I discovered there was also a manga</br>  <br> Saldeath = A. Pina <br>Okay, I'm not even going to bother figuring out this one.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Ma che poi quanto cazzo sono ritardati e inespressivi i personaggi nella dub italiana? Cristo ho provato a vedermi le puntate doppiate da sabaody in poi visto che quella inglese ancora non c'era arrivata e non avevo voglia della sub, ma ho smesso in tempo 4 secondi. Puro cancro</br></br></br></br>  <br>As strange as it is, it kept the original joke intact.<br><br>Saldeath = Sarudesu = I'm an monkey. A. Pina, or rather, apina, means monkey.<br><br>So he introduced himself "Olen A. Pina". I'm an monkey.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not entirely convinced, do you have more proof?</br>  <br>Yeah about that, it happened the same to me. Fucking Rubber. I heard they're releasing the new episodes (should be the end of fishman island IIRC)</br>  <br>lo so anon da quando è cambiato il doppiatore di Rufy non si può più seguire. Io rido ancora se penso che i doppiatori quando è arrivato OP in Italia hanno pensato seriamente "ha il potere della gomma chiamiamolo Rubber, siamo troppo edgy" con i bambini italiani che non capiscono un cazzo di inglese e non avrebbero comunque capito il riferimento</br>  <br>His own explanation? He just is.<br>High quality writing there, Oda.</br></br>  <br>yeah overall it's pretty fucking bad. I never even bothered with the anime, I know some friends of mine who keep watching it even in italian and I can't for the life of me figure out what the appeal is.<br><br><br>thinking about it kills me. They though Rubber would make for a clever joke, probably, but they completely forgot about their audience... Italian kids. Seriously? Italian ADULTS barely know italian, let alone english, how the fuck do you hope an italian child could ever know what Rubber means</br></br></br></br>  <br>"White Facial Hair" doesn't sound as cool.</br>  <br>thought*</br>  <br>Ma seriamente. Come uccidere un anime. Naruto a confronto sembra un miracolo divino</br>  <br> Italian ADULTS barely know italian, let alone english </br>  <br>Tashigi is old and busted<br><br>Now is the time for a  beautiful swordswoman who cooks meat </br></br></br>  <br>I'm so excited for the next. Only 4 character pages left unless Oda does more non-Straw Hats. I thought Tashigi and the kids would get one for a long time, now my money's on Monet/Vergo, or a Bellamy one the second the arc ends</br>  How are they going to leave Dressrosa?<br><br>With any of the colosseum guys?</br></br>  <br><br> monet/vergo alive <br><br>Is this the new "Rebecca will join"?</br></br></br></br>  <br> With any of the colosseum guys? <br><br>Romeo has a ship. And we still need to find out what's in that goddamn suitcase so we Barto Club now</br></br></br>  Guys if dressrosa was the new world alabasta (also with 2 preliminary arcs), where will wano kingdom be? I think it fits at thriller bark level, also the 7th shichibukai can be from wano. And what will the new world enies lobby be? It couldn't be the new marine HQ, but it's the only marine stronghold in the new world (and mariejoa will be the end game)<br><br><br><br>Many keks. <br>https://<span>youtu.be/qtMiH9UjtXM  [ ]  NOW IS THE TIME OF LUNCH </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>just because Alabaster and Pink Dress parallel, doesnt mean the rest of the story will have them</br>  <br>I don't think they're alive, but I believe Oda will show them to have lived, if that makes sense. Just playing the odds of characters we thought died that didn't</br>  <br>Why would someone from Wano become a Shichibukai? Weren't they so badass, not even the WG dare talk shit to them?I don't see how they'd benefit from providing a Shichibukai. They don't need protection.</br>  <br><br>Plus, I don't think we need another swordsman in the Shichibukai.</br></br>  <br>He did pretty well for himself before he got Hakuba'd though. He took out Ideo and a bunch of fodder. He was one of the better Donquixote execs, plus he got to be half fishman which was new. Oda didnt really skimp out on his character in my opinion.</br>  <br> we still need to find out what's in that goddamn suitcase <br>Wasn't it just posters and newspaper clippings of the strawhats?</br></br>  <br>I guess it could be, but all the chains and the prominent shot of it makes me think its more important<br><br>I've been racking my brain for anything significant from the SH's past that Bart could bring back to them, but I've got nothing</br></br></br>  Where did PX-1 go, /a/?  what's up with Oda, fuck is his problem why is he taking so long to show kaido  <br>He skipped face day.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br> I haven't watched any OP in a long time, but I image shityness began when the anime caught up with the manga. That's usually how it works. Stupid Japs, not doing seasons like American shows.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He went back in time through a wormhole.</br>  <br>Some anime do, like Gintama, and it's much better because of it.</br>  <br>Back to Vegapunk would probably be the most likely answer if Kuma actually put some thought into it, it's not like it matters.</br>  When will we see the new Pacifista models Sentomaru talked about?  <br> What the fuck were they thinking? <br><br>We want the Harry Potter audience.</br></br></br>  <br> Vegapunk did Z a favor <br> Made personal Pacifistas for him </br></br>  <br><br><br>She doesn't bother me like everyone else, I kind like her, but she has absolutely nothing to contribute to the crew. Bart's and Law's abilities would be awesome additions. Barriers, and Law's overpowered ridiculousness, are great for more tactical battle plans, and just plain fucking shit up.The only downside is all the lame, annoying faggots obsessed with Law. The fruity, lovey-dovey shit those creepy fags post, is gayer then straight-up, man on man but pounding.</br></br></br>  <br>Those aren't canon, it was just a way for Oda to say that in the New World we would encounter stronger Pacifistas, most likely just better Vegapunk tech in general.</br>  <br><br>Nah, trannies are weird people and Oda likes everything weird. There's nothing more to it.<br>Though he did say he wore fishnets, now whether that was a joke or not...</br></br></br>  <br>Someone skipped legday</br>  <br>What happens when Law lets him join his crew?</br>  <br>Well memed friend, you totally weren't the 25353981st to make that joke.</br>  <br>Law ?

Law landed exactly 4 hits on Doffy throughout this entire arc. Only 2 of those hits were landed in actual 1v1 fights (He grazed doffy's cheek in 729 and used his injection shot in 768). The only way he was able to attack him after that was by playing dead and using Luffy as a decoy to deliver his strongest attacks, which ultimately did nothing. At no point in this story since Law and Doffy were introduced has Law ever "beat the fuck out of Doffy".<br><br>So to answer your question, no Law would be absolutely destroyed in a fight with Doffy with no outside help.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm actually less turned on and more concerned about her organs <br><br>Skinny looks nice but that just looks disconcerting.</br></br></br>  I m not sure if this was discussed before but they released Hawkins song<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3g0<wbr>5tPg9U5U</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>you would fuck it anyway if you had the chance, don't lie to yourself</br>  Who of the Straw Hats are virgins and who aren't?  <br>No one but Sanji and Chopper.</br>  <br>No, because it'd probably die at the slightest force and i don't want to be liable</br>  <br>Germany isn't the most hated country world wide, but it's one of the most hated countries on the internet.</br>  <br>Luffy, Chopper and Sanji.</br>  <br>Sanji is eternal virgin.<br>Everyone else has a shot at da pussi.</br></br>   you will never go on a pirate adventure with a clan of buddies   canon reason given by Hawkeye for why he chased the Krieg pirates.<br><br>Viz translates the line as "for fun."</br></br>  <br>says who? you?</br>  <br>Just the opposite.

Who runs faster, Nami or Robin? Whose boobs would fall out first if they ran?  <br> Forgetting Dellinger </br>  <br>Most of the regular execs were pretty impressive.</br>  <br>I can't remember any instances of Zoro experiencing sexual attraction.

Zoro knows how to chill out too.</br>  <br>I would say that Luffy, Zoro, and Robin are all asexual. Nami has only ever shown interest in Kalifa, not once in a guy, so she might be gay.</br>  <br> Zoro is Kuinaphiliac <br><br>Zoro only gets off on baiting Sanji. And Sake</br></br></br>  <br>Kuzan is cooler though. He has the perfect balance of chill and serious.</br>    <br>Nah, I'm fairly certain Robin is, at least, straight.

Or 1kg of feathers ? <br> That's right. It's 1kg of steel. Because steel is heavier than feathers. </br></br>  <br>so Zoro is an aromantic sake-sexual?</br>  I like how no one argues about Law being gay.  <br>we all know who Law was created for, let's not be coy here</br>  <br>Doffy isn't a traitor , you mean Rocinante ?</br>  <br>I honestly missed this</br>  <br>I think it's doflamingo</br>  <br>love how Luffy clearly has no idea what he's supposed to be looking at</br>  <br>Oda spits on his female fans (metaphorically), so I doubt he would consider our shippings in his writing or drawing.</br>  Do you guys think Luffy fits the concept of an Übermensch as outlined in the writings of 19th century philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche?  <br>It's actually Roci. Look at that hair and broken jaw. That's definitely why Roci couldn't speak.</br>  <br>he doesnt exactly spit on them, he just doesnt consider suggestions from female fans<br><br>that in no way stops him from doing things on his own though</br></br></br>  <br>Doffy is usually seen as the shittiest of the two though.</br>  <br>iunno, nigga</br>  <br>Then what is Adonis D. Water Law? And Dellinger, who is clearly a gay slutboy.</br>  <br>Well, he definitely knows. It just doesn't really bother him normally. Not sure why the artist decided to make Luffy clueless on that fanart cause he definitely knows both male and female anatomy.</br>  <br>Does he really ? Aren't you supposed to make your own morals to be an Ubermensch ? In One Piece, most people inherit their morals from someone else, Luffy got his from Shanks. I'm not sure the concept of ubermensch is compatible with the OP world.</br>  <br>Sure.</br>  <br>I'm just saying Law was what he wanted to create, it wasn't at all in reaction to his fujoshi fans or anything.</br>  <br>I don't think Dellinger was designed to appeal to girls though.</br>  <br>Also Kid, Shanks, Mihawk, Roci, Ace, Zoro, Sanji, etc. There's plenty of girls who like Aokiji and Smoker as well. <br><br>Why are cute guys so  cute ?</br></br></br>  <br>True, but most of the fanart of him comes from girls who find him cute.</br>  <br> &gt;I can see her fuck girls with her playful nature, but I think she only falls in love with dudes. <br><br>That's because you're a neckbeard that wants her to be your waifu</br></br></br>  <br>All those characters aren't meant for girls, they have large female followings, but that was on accident on the part of Oda which Toei took advantage of.</br>  <br> mfw am girl </br>  Someone post cute pictures, I need to forget the existence of pic related.  <br>He got really offended when Monet hit on him, and his drive in life is a dude said he loved him when he was 13. <br><br>Oh and his entire crew is dudes and hearts pop up whenever they talk about law.</br></br></br>  <br>Sure.</br>  <br><br>Nami is probably fools around with cute girls for free, but she makes men pay.</br></br>  <br>Then you're a shit one for not realizing Robin's love.</br>  <br>To be fair, the relationship between Law and Corazon was obviously familial, even most fujoshi can see that given that most fanart of them is platonic especially when Law is so often paired up with guys, they can see it's kind of gross to pair up father and son.</br>  <br>do you think fugging law is a rite of entry into his crew</br>  <br>That doesn't bother fujos. There's plenty of aged up Law with Corazon, and even some shota  like that one creepy pixiv artist </br>  <br>I'm not saying Law was gay for Corazon, just that Corazon probably influenced him accepting his own gayness. <br><br><br>I'm sure he at least teases them</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jean Bart and Bepo...<br>Law's disgusting.</br></br>  I think Robin is a woman of pragmatism.<br>She'll make love with anything, but never truly give up her art for anyone.<br>She may have had a preference long ago but is not afraid to tease either sex now if it'll keep them on their toes.</br></br>  <br>They're still sparse compared to the number of Law fangirls. Liking Dellinger requires finer taste than average.<br><br><br>Sure</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This. The whole thing was Corazón going: OMG you suffered so much as my brother and I, I dont want you to end up a sadistic sociopath like him.</br></br>  <br>It's the minority though, Corazon is more often paired up with his brother where the familial love is much less so despite being blood-related it's less icky.</br>  <br>Nami's probably the same way.</br>  <br>Too girly for fujos and too sadistic for fudanshis. It's tough being a Dellinger fan.</br>  <br><br>Im really hoping for a flashback about Bepo joining Law.</br></br>  <br> reminds me of doflamingo </br>  <br>that may be so but he certainly didnt make Law any straighter when he saw the rise of LawLu. He seems to have zero issues with shipteasing</br>  Surprisingly for often this fandom obsesses over power levels, I'm not seeing much acknowledgement of the fact that Luffy is definitely stronger than Law.  I could see it become a running gag that Sanji is the only (perma)virgin in the crew. Robin, Franky, Nami, Brook have obviously fucked/raped. Luffy seems too asexual but you never know what could have happened on Amazon lily with hancock/margaret/other girls. Remember this: <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qKx<wbr>ufU4oiDc</wbr>  [ ]<br>Chopper is a fucking reindeer shunned by other animals and people. Only Kureha and Dr. Hiluluk ever interacted with him. Can't see hem fuck either lol. Maybe Robin wanted some of that reindeer cock. Zoro doesn't seems interested in women, but he likes to drink. I can see him fucking Perona on a drinking night. Usopp gets to fuck Kaya whenever he gets back. Maybe Nami let him get some too.</br></br>  <br>Nami's a lesbian.<br>Maybe from implied abuse, or simply because she was raised by a dyke and lived in an all girl family with no strong father figures.</br></br>  <br>Indeed.</br>  <br>Luffy interacts with all his stoic male friends like that, Zoro and Sanji just got accustomed to it, it's really not ship teasing.</br>  <br><br>I'd love to see this being real. Suits up Kaido's silouette. The only thing missing is the helmet/mask.<br><br>It also  Makes him look like a giant from Elbaf </br></br></br></br>  <br>Genzo was her father, she considered him on the same level as her mother as evidenced by her tattoo with the pinwheel-tangerine design.</br>  <br> &gt; I'm not seeing much acknowledgement of the fact that Luffy is definitely stronger than Law. <br><br>it's because the only fighting they'll do is deciding who tops that night so it doesn't really matter</br></br></br>  <br>Aged up CoraLaw is cute, though it's true that it feels a little weird compared most Law ships. Whenever I look at pics of them I kind of feel like I'm committing a sin. And I prefer seeing Roci paired up with his big bro after all.</br>  What happens if a Fishman eats a Hito Hito no mi<br>Is there a Fishman Fishman no mi?</br>  <br><br>What's to decide?<br><br>Luffy is an alpha with a dominant personality. Of course he's going to top. There's nothing sub about him</br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy would never bottom, it goes against his character, he hates being submissive in any situation.</br>  <br>Will there ever be doujins of him?</br>  <br>it's not exactly the same. Zoro and Law get somewhat different treatment. It's minor things but that's all it really takes<br><br>I think Oda speaks Fujo better than most people give him credit for</br></br></br>  <br> Luffy is bossier with Law than other males <br> Law acts angry but ends up submitting to what Luffy wants </br></br>  <br><br>Yes thank you guys. I get so tired of all the art with Luffy bottoming out there. He's too straightforward for it. Also Law's a huge bottom.</br></br>  <br> Whenever I look at pics of them I kind of feel like I'm committing a sin <br>Just fuck your father and be done with it.</br></br>  <br>I'm fine with either way. But I wish there was more art of luffy on top just because there's less of it.</br>  <br><br>That was exactly how Luffy and Zoro's friendship was before they really tightened their bonds.</br></br>  <br><br><br>bottom=/=submissive<br><br>Luffy could prefer dick up his ass and be dominant.

I like you. </br>  <br>Just because its searchable doesnt mean its good</br>  <br>oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit</br>  <br><br>This movie won't come out subbed for like a year and a half. Maybe longer</br></br>  remember when yuya thought it was a good idea to use all of his cards at once  <br>It'll be out in Japan in 2016 May, and later that year for the rest of the world. You know you want to hear sexy Dan Green again.</br>  <br>Thats a pretty beautiful waifu you got there Yuya<br>It would be a shame if something happened to her</br></br>  <br>Remember when people only read opponent's cards effects for random plot conveniences even though they can at all times?<br><br>I definitely do, I actually liked the DM dub, at least as far as Kaiba/Atem went.</br></br></br>  <br>Shining Dragon isn't bad because it's a main deck monster. It's bad because it is a main deck monster that requires an extra deck monster to summon, one which requires a reasonable amount of resources to get out.<br><br>And in the end it isn't that much stronger than Ultimate.<br><br>Shining would be a decent card if it just required one blue-eyes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shadoll Fusion for Blue-Eyes FIXED</br>  <br>The problem I have with the movie is the fact that is 6 months after the manga, so, that means it won't have any connections with GX and the people who died in the manga will remain dead? Or it will be a mix of the two storylines?</br>  <br>But will it explain Ushio's immortality?</br>  <br>The movie has just destroyed our good times on this threads<br>We will never hear the end of this will we</br></br>  <br>It will tie in to Arc-V in some way<br><br>It has the word Dimension in the fucking title and the bladeless duel disk</br></br></br>  <br>Bitch please, she can handle you soon enough, once she masters synchro summoning.</br>  <br>  has the word Dimension <br>Someone please kill me</br></br>  <br> Yuzu beating Yuri <br><br>Kek</br></br></br>  <br> yuzu beating anyone relevant ever <br><br>top kek</br></br></br>  <br>Oh come on, she beat... Masumi? In their second round after preparing a whole deck against her.<br>She was kinda relevant, I guess.</br></br>  <br>Masumi would be carded if she was involved with the plot at all</br>  <br>No he just ages well, 5Ds is probably only like 30 years after DM anyways.</br>   Next episode Yuzu is a thirsty KINGU groupie <br>You know it to be true</br>  <br>Is Bakura MIA in this?</br>  <br>Yugi and Kaiba use Synchro and XYZ</br>  <br> Bakura <br> Ever being relevant <br><br>You can tell that the big wigs wished Takahashi had never introduced him so they could fully focus on jacking off Kaiba</br></br></br></br>  card game in motorcycle + picking up card in the ground<br>this game sure became more dangerous</br>  <br> like ryou bakura in the first season <br> hardly ever shows up again. <br>i think he had 3 or 4 scenes after that.</br></br></br>  this is like some deepest lore<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>78426</wbr></br>  <br>one of them being   told to fuck off because of his evil spirit and running off crying  <br>  or was that the manga  </br></br>  BASED KINGU  <br>It's called Wheelie Breakers</br>  <br>I really want Yuya to win the Friendship Cup and fight Jack again, hell he can even do his LADIES AND GENTLEMAN shtick. <br><br>I just want Jack to end up pushing his buttons hard enough where he just outright summons OERD and wins</br></br></br>  <br>If Yuya wins, he can firmly stand at the top and tell everyone about Academia's invasion<br><br>Yugo can duel Jack literally any other time, Yuya needs to fuck Jack up since this is his only chance.</br></br></br>  Reiji wont be taking part in the friendship coup, right?  <br>Just in case you thought dueling on motorcycles wasn't extreme enough</br>  <br>Before dueling KINGU Yuya will need to win against  HUNGRY DUELING . And that probably won't happen.<br> Crow will be the one to duel Jack. Too many flags point to this. Also 5D's epilogue. </br></br>  <br> too many flags to point to this <br><br>Like what? That he called Jack a traitor?</br></br></br>  Top duels<br><br>DM: Joey vs Marik/Ishizu vs Kaiba/Yugi vs Atem<br>GX: Judai vs Yubel/Judai vs Yugi<br>5DS: Yusei vs Kiryu/Jack vs Carly<br>Zexal: Yuma vs III<br>Zexal II: Yuma vs Vector/IV vs Nasch/Kaito vs Mizael (3)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Too many flags point to this <br>What flags? Because the single biggest flag we've seen is Yuya getting beat down by Jack and being told he needs to improve his entertainment duels and make them less self satisfying to have a hope against him</br></br>  <br>The fact that he said it multiple times and that they were teamates in 5Ds.</br>  How the fuck are Yuya's duels self satisfying? People loved them  <br> 5D's <br><br>But this is Arc-V</br></br></br>  <br>Crow could never beat Jack in 5Ds, and that wont change now. More important, Jack is the final boss of this arc and Yuya is the protag, they arent going to have him lose and watch the climactic battle in the stands. The only other person I see with a slim chance of facing Jack is Yugo</br>  <br> Yuya needs to fuck Jack up since this is his only chance. <br>Oh wow. I like Yuya too, but that's too retarded, man. I fucking detested a creature like you, why are you allowed to exist? Whoever let you live must be the worst kind of living being.</br></br>  <br>I hope he does.</br>  <br>And Yuya has to fight Yugo in order to beat Jack<br><br>So unless the Friendship Cup is called off, Yuya is going to duel Jack again</br></br></br>    <br>The problem is that Yuya was not dueling in his entertainment style. He went full dragons just like he did with Reji and paid for it. That's 2 losses now where he over extended himself just to try a relentless attack on the enemy. On top of that, This was not Entertainment dueling as Yuya did not once acknowledge the audience, just smashing Jack's face in.</br>  <br> your dueling is self-satisfaction <br> MANZOKU </br></br>  <br> Jack is the final boss of this arc <br> not end_your_turn guy </br></br>  Jack is a talentless hack who doesn't understand entertainment dueling   Yugo and Yuzu rescue Yuya <br> He's unconscious so he doesn't know <br> His determination to prove his father's dueling style is the best to Jack will cause him to lose Yuzu again <br>We're getting full on Shakespearean, boys</br></br></br>  <br>Jack is the KINGU of entertainment.<br>Now, stop posting, Yuya. We all understand that you are got a shitty father.</br></br>  Whose VA do you think has the best voice during the summon chants?

He was more thinking, that poor guy, he's going to get wrecked by KINGU.</br>  <br>He wasn't, his own words were, "Yuya is going to be a sacrifice."</br>  <br>I'm not sure why people are so triggered about it being in DM again.

These are things we'll never know.</br>  <br> Why didn't Yuya use rune-eyes' effect that makes it immune to the opponent's cards the turn it was summoned? <br>Because the anime version doesn't have the protection effect like how anime Beast-Eyes can't be contact fused, you baka</br></br>  <br>And ride each other, sometimes.</br>  <br>You're right, I'm retarded. I thought he just ended the turn afterwards.</br>  <br>Wow mean</br>  <br> sees Rebellion's anime effect used <br> asks why wasn't a real world effect used <br>I never get why people are so retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>Pendulum monster mechanics state if it would be sent from the field to the graveyard, it goes to the Extra Deck. But since it's never sent to the graveyard, but the banished zone, they're simply banished. Learn rulings please</br>  <br>Checked</br>  <br>Go on ygopro, give the ai a pendulum deck, bring out dark law and settle this argument for good.</br>  This again?<br><br> Q: If Macro Cosmos or Banisher of the Radiance are on the field, will a Pendulum Monster on the field be placed face-up in the Extra Deck if it is destroyed? <br> A: While the effects of Macro Cosmos or Banisher of the Radiance are being applied, if a Pendulum Monster on the field is destroyed, it will be banished instead of returning to the Extra Deck. <br><br>http://ygorganization.com/ocg-07171<wbr>4-rulings/</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>wasn't it word of god that they are banished if stuff like marcos cosmos is on the field? its also a reason for why most of those cards stay limited. cause they ruin the pendulum decks which are still on the rise. like how they nerfed synchro before jerking xyz.</br></br></br>  <br>How about you do it? You're the one that's complaining, and you also have multiple people against you. Nobody has to waste their time correcting an idiot that can't understand card text.</br>  <br>I think you're confusing me with someone else, that's the only thing I've said on this thread.</br>  I love how KINGU stomped poor Yuuya and spat on his entertainment.<br>feels bretty gud</br>  <br>Macros Cosmos and Dimensional Fissure are both at 3 in the OCG, and they did shit to Magician or Qlis in their prime.</br>  <br>Just checked it against Qliphort, they are banished. Dark heroes Yuri would be fantastic and fit his theme really well.</br>  <br> ▶ dark law can't do shit to them <br><br>Card effects trump game mechanics. Every time. You, my lovable anon, are in the wrong.</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry.

And the arm has a lot more than a scar. Junk Warrior waited 5 openings to do that shit.</br>  <br> did Junk Warrior did that Scar? <br>Its probably partially a reference to that, mostly a reference to that being the arm Jack had his Signer mark</br></br>  reminder that I'm hosting an animu tourney with a prize.<br><br>http://challonge.com/tomo10<br><br>related: so what note of 5D's are they going to hit next? jean-michel being keikaku'ing the downfall of the commons using synchro summoning?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yuya worst Yu <br><br>Good joke</br></br></br>  <br> skinny everywhere with a toned chest <br>Why did they have to make the perfect boy the straightest one</br></br>  <br>It shouldnt be legal to have such a lickable body</br>  <br>Anime is a mistake</br>  <br>But he is...

That's cool right?<br><br>Riding Action Duels, if you will</br></br>  <br> entire archetype is Archfiend <br>ftfy</br></br>  <br>He's obviously talking about Red Sprinter, Red Wyvern, etc.</br>  <br>What? are we watching the same show? Crow would be pretty lucky if he survives in his duel against Gon. Crow is not part of the plot, the Lancers are.</br>  <br>Fujo plz.</br>  <br>Crow is a Lancer, you retard.</br>  The Yuyas and Yuzus are Kaiba and Blue Eyes Chick, torn apart and separated.  <br>Says who? Reiji won't give a fuck about him, and I'm sure he won't fight in the Fusion dimension like the others.</br>  <br>To be fair, Reiji doesn't really care about the Lancers either.</br>  <br>The plot right now is uncovering whats happening in the syncro dimension and defeating Jack, which Gon has 0 connection to. What would Gon advancing accomplish? And why the hell would they bring Crow back and have him get knocked out of the tourney without winning any duels in show?</br>  <br>It will be a contact fusion of two fusion monsters.</br>  Who is the biggest waifu/husbando fag in Yugioh history; Yuya or Judai?  What are the changes of Arc-V characters appearing in the movie, now that we know that Kaiba's up to dimensional shenanigans?<br><br>Not even fujo, just love all things cute</br></br>  <br>we all know that yuuya is gonna win the tournament then dominate the KINGU</br>  Gon's probably not going to make it through.<br><br>Crow will beat him, and then Yugo will beat Crow.<br><br>The only duel up in the air is the Yuzu duel, unless she goes up against a literally who.<br><br>Personally, I'm hoping for Serena for the bantz.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Like that's unique when Reiji and Sawatari are also around</br>  <br> Sawatari <br>Sawataris only Papa issues is that nobody in this dimension knows who the guy is</br></br>  <br> Personally, I'm hoping for Serena for the bantz. <br>That's a pretty dumb reason. It's a duel that would determine whether or not Ruris can absorb one another.</br></br>  <br>He is fanservice, just like Jack. They don't serve any purpose beside plot devices to explain the background of the Synchro dimension and help Yuya and the Lancers to grow stronger. They could have been replaced by other people and the situation would be the same. And Gon has more potential than Crow and Jack, to be fair.</br>  <br>It's pretty obvious his papa coddled him and did almost everything for him</br>  <br><br>And Yuzu and Reira, and Ninja guy has brother issues.</br></br>  <br> why the hell would they bring Crow back and have him get knocked out of the tourney without winning any duels in show? <br>Blackwings are his purpose just like in 5Ds. Besides it's not like Sora has won an onscreen duel. He lost his first two anyway</br></br>  <br>Crow being there gives another person with a real stake in syncro dimension, along with someone who possibly has a prior relationship to Jack to fill Yuya in. He'd also make a good opponent for Yuya, as opposed to Gon who's already been beat by him.<br><br> And Gon has more potential than Crow and Jack, to be fair <br>Long term Gon is going to be in the show longer than either of them, but for the next arc i'm much more interested in their characters and history than Gon. They dont have any development set up for him to go through at all, Gon has mostly been a Yuya coddling and card conveying device for a while  not that I dont like him </br></br></br></br>  <br>Are we watching the same show? All the duelists that the Executive Council stopped Jean-michel from arresting are Lancers. The reason they are even giving them a chance to fight is because they are with Reiji.<br><br>And yes Crow is a part of the plot, moreso than Gongenzaka. Crow is the one who saved Yuya and co., Crow is the one who let the Lancers break out with them, and Crow is the one who told Yuya about who Jack truly is. Crow has had more of an impact on Yuya than anyone else in this arc and the writers bringing up his view on Jack means this is a plot point that will be revisited in later episodes.<br><br>What the hell does Gongenzaka have anything to do with the plot?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Says who <br>The Executive Council<br><br> Reiji won't give a fuck about him, and I'm sure he won't fight in the Fusion dimension like the others <br><br>Of course Reiji wouldn't care that a strong duelist from the Synchro Dimension is joining his side, not like that wasn't the entire goal of this dimensional road trip in the first place<br><br>Get your Crow hate boner out of here, faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Besides it's not like Sora has won an onscreen duel <br>Crow hasnt even won an off screen one. Considering how Arc V has been treating the previous series elements as if the viewers have never seen the previous show, it'd be moronic to have a guy who never established himself as an actual good duelist job to Gon and act like that means shit<br><br><br> What the hell does Gongenzaka have anything to do with the plot? <br>People should be glad he's getting as much screentime as he is, he got an actual duel this arc as opposed to equally or more relevant characters like Serena, Sawatari and Reiji</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yuya and Dennis having the exact same Duel Runner just with a different shade of red annoys me<br><br>Feels like the Duel Runners won't be unique for each character like in 5D's</br></br>  Which protagonists had the worst connection to their monsters?<br><br>I think Judai had the strongest, then Yugi, then Yuya. What about Yuma and Yusei?</br></br>  <br>Yusei had strong connections to every card in his deck, he's basically a monster slut</br>  <br>The Council doesn't seem to think so, since something bad happens to those who lose in the FC, and the first two match ups they set are Gon vs Crow and Tsukikage vs Shinji.</br>  <br>Yuma only cared for Hope despite having pretty much over a hundred cards in his deck</br>  <br> Feels like the Duel Runners won't be unique for each character like in 5D's <br>I guess its justified in their cases because they didnt make their own runner or have someone customize it for them, they're just some spare ones they had lying around.</br></br>  <br>Crow is just stupid fanservice for Blackwings. Making him a permanent part of the main cast is a mess. I hope the writers are smart enough to not do it. Not worth watching the second part if Gon is going to job to him. Like hell I want to watch Arc V for 5D characters.</br>  <br>Yuma<br><br>Jaden, Yugi, and Yusei actually held conversations with their monsters and Action Duels allow Yuya to interact with his monsters as if they are living beings and his friends, like Hippo for example. Also his dragons are connected to him on a much more deeper level than the other characters.</br></br></br>  <br>Gotta save that money somehow. I expect others maybe, the main cast will probably use the (What I call) rental models.</br>  <br>But that's not 5D's Crow, it's Arc-V Crow</br>  <br> Yusei no card is trash Fudo  <br> In charge of not having the strongest connection with his deck. <br>It's here :^)</br></br></br>  <br> Crow is just stupid fanservice for Blackwings <br>But Crow has already had far more impact on the plot and Yuya than Gon has this arc. You just have an autistic hateboner for Crow even though he has done literally nothing wrong so far<br><br><br>To be fair, the rest of the Numbers were pricks<br><br><br>For such a tough guy, he had some goddamn adorable cards</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I guess since it's summer time, the anti-Crow fags are coming out  <br>I want to be protected by Yusei</br>  <br>Not him, but Arc-V crow is a lot more boring than his 5Ds counterpart, the same with Jack. They only were interesting thanks to the chemistry they had with Yusei. At least they should have gave us Kiryu and Sherry because they were pretty solid by themselves.</br>  I would like to admit to something<br><br> I find the Arc-V story so compelling that I've created my own OC characters and villains to join the plot and I use YGOpro to do the duels as well as written openings, endings, and episode summaries <br><br>Pls no bully</br></br></br></br>  <br> I guess since it's summer time, the anti-Crow fags are coming out <br>Wouldn't kids like Crow and not hate him? They'd like Blackwings anyway.</br></br>  <br>Kids would also like Crow because he took in 3 orphan kids and raises them as if he is there big brother and has gotten angry multiple times at the thought his kids may be in danger</br>  <br> Unironically believing the summer meme </br>  <br>Is it so hard to brighten the picture?<br>And see his fuking face?</br></br>  <br> Evangelion <br><br>Fuck off</br></br></br>  <br>Garnet?</br>  <br>Neither have gotten all that much time in the spotlight, Crow was always more about his great chemistry with Jack than Yusei, but I got a laugh out of HUNGRY DUEL anyway. And Jacks had less than a dozen non duel lines so far, i'll be curious to see what they've replaced Yusei with in his background and character<br><br><br>Kids dont like caring considerate people, they like badass edgelords like Shun</br></br></br></br>  <br>That depends<br> Ritual dimension? </br></br>  <br>His face is pretty clear, I don't know what you guys are on<br><br>He has a criminal mark like a bolt going through his left and right eye each, as well as a cyborg-like eye, criminal marks going down his neck and a triangle mark at the bottom of it.</br></br></br>  <br>Well crow did call Jack a traitorous bastard, pushed Yuya around when Yuya wanted to break out with them, and is a member of a gang with criminal marks</br>  <br> Yes, as a final boss-like place. I don't want the story to be 1:1 Arc-V </br>  <br> Disgusting self-inserter </br>  I'm pretty sure the Council pit Crow and Shinji against Gongenzaka and Tsukikage in order to show them what happens when a duelist loses. You know? To put some fear in the Lancers' hearts and make sure they don't take things lightly.  im the only one who wants akaba leo using lovecraft.dek?  I don't know what I'm doing anymore.  <br>Or they want to see if the Lancers are desperate enough for an alliance that they'd willingly throw their Commons accomplices to the 'loser's fate', depending on how bad that actually is.</br>  <br>Just delete the deck and build Nekroz.</br>  <br>Besides Yuya and Tokumatsu, none of them even know about the "loser's fate". In their view, its just losing, try again next time.</br>  <br><br> Yuya vs Atlas-sama <br> Yuya loses <br> Spoiler <br><br>Anon please</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I hope we'll get something like this.</br>  <br>Here's a better image</br>  <br>Soon Jack, soon. You will be Yusei'd by Yuya and I will like it.</br>  <br>Imo, Arc-V Crow has slightly more to him (with what screentime he's had) with how invested he seems to be in the whole Tops-Commons thing, since both iterations' main schtick is being a robin hood that takes care of orphans.<br><br>Crow and Shinji seem to despise anything to do with the Tops, see things like the FC and Jack's position as king as shams, and would love to see the entire system turned on its head. In contrast to a younger and more optimistic kid like Yugo who wants nothing more than to be like Jack and win a Tops lifestyle for himself and Rin.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think a friendly duel results in absorption. <br><br>I think one of the Ruris will have to be FUCKING PISSED to absorb another Ruri<br><br>But if Yuzu absorbs Selena after a friendly duel then oh god, we're about to reach a whole new level of suffering</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They've avoided showing Ruri vs Ruri duels so far, though.</br>  <br>She may be shit, but she is shit I want to fuck.</br>  <br>Zexal girls are top tier breeding material</br>  <br> Using ritual as final boss <br>DROPPED<br> Seriously I'll drop this series if they do some shit like that, because that will be for me totally expected seeing how the extra decks are considered being important, no matter how many plot twist they add, and I don't want that </br></br></br>  <br> Implying rituals can be good enough to being even the final boss's right hand. <br>topkek</br></br>  <br>They're not. Rituals aren't from the Extra Deck and thus do not matter<br><br><br>And that's all they're good for</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think Yuzu is even going to duel Selena at this point. Too early. The Ruris are endgame content.</br>  <br><br>What if Arc-V 2 new thing is that ritual monsters are now part of the extra deck and their summoning method is revamped</br></br>  <br> What if Arc-V 2 new thing is that ritual monsters are now part of the extra deck <br>That'd be really dumb since then they'd just be fusion monsters. They know how to make decent rituals when they want to now anyway</br></br>  <br><br>Mieru basically was there to confirm that Rituals are no special summoning method and are treated like Gemini or Union. It doesn't have it's own dimension, no worries</br></br>  <br>Well that's never going to happen and that would literally just make them Fusion monsters with Synchro's level requirement, so its fucking dumb</br>  <br>What is after Usagi?</br>  <br>It has it's own card color, it's gonna have it's own dimension just you wait.</br>  I know that I can't be the only that was upset that Yuya actually lost in 3 turns. I mean yeah sure, I get that they had to set up Jack as the God, but can Yuya at least make it to turn 4 to show everybody how strong he is?<br><br>I mean fuck he damn near blew Jack the fuck out, come on, at least have ZA KINGU acknowledge a little of his strength FUCK</br></br>  Reminder that Yuzu and Yugo slept together when they were living on the streets.  <br> Jack <br> acknowledging anyone but Yusei </br></br>  <br>I hope you are right. I prefer rituals being an important support for heroes. Or maybe for villains, but not final boss.<br><br>At this point, I rather not.</br></br></br>  <br>IIRC, this is the first time the protagonist has ever been OTK'd.</br>  <br> I mean fuck he damn near blew Jack the fuck out <br>Jack was in control the entire time, you could see the apprehension in Reiji's face</br></br>  <br> Not a wind <br> Odd-eyes slow dragon <br> Not a wind <br> not maining 3 of the level 3 <br>I don't think you understand the term "speedroids"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off ntr faggot, go to that thrashy crap show that only degenerate beast like you can enjoy.</br>  <br>You're disgusting</br>  <br>That is exactly why he's great, though.</br>  Can someone please explain something to me about red daemons dragon scar-right's effect? It said that it destroys monsters with attack less than it's own attack? Then why was Odd Eyes destroyed when it had the same attack as Red daemon?<br><br>Did I just get a shitty sub that left out "less than or equal to. . ."?</br></br>  <br>It's less than or equal to</br>  <br>Krebons. I've actually replaced him with symphonic drums.</br>  <br> I mean fuck he damn near blew Jack the fuck out <br>Do you actually believe this?</br></br>  <br>Rune-eyes has 2800 and Dark Rebellion has 2500, I see nothing wrong with it</br>  <br>They dont even KINGU</br>  <br>Rune-eyes has 3000</br>  <br>Rune-Eyes has 3000 m8. That's why he asked.</br>  <br><br>You`re right, i`m retarded. I was thinking of Odd-eyes absolute, been playing too much pendulum magicians.</br></br>  <br>iirc kaito blew yuma out in one turn, and did in such a way to completely humiliate him.</br>  <br> go to that thrashy crap show that only degenerate beast like you can enjoy. <br><br>But I already am watching NTR-V :^)</br></br></br>  <br>Yuya is a scrub though. He attacked into a set trap card that he didn't know and that's something he commonly does</br>  <br> NTR-V <br>I want 2ch memes to go</br></br>  <br>Worst fetish</br>  <br> BOOKS! </br>  <br>The duel was not even that great. It was blatantly obvious that Jack was going to be the winner since the beginning.</br>  <br> not liking Yugo/Yuzu interactions <br><br>It's beautiful. Yuya is going to get everybody killed for Yuzu.wav, he needs a kick in the ass, and this is the only way to make him learn.</br></br></br>  <br>Leave the fuck out with your shitty fetish or else I will find you and kill you.</br>  <br>He calmed down after Jean-Michel said she's be in the tourney and isn't with Security. The only thing he was thinking about this episode is what went on in the Council's room before the match.</br>  <br>Just think about how it'll play out<br> After so much struggling and pain, Yuya finally meets Yuzu again <br> He's almost crying in joy <br> Yuzu smiles and says she's glad to see him <br> Oh, you two have never been properly introduced have you? This is Yugo, my new boyfriend! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> dat butt shaking <br>my sides</br></br>  <br>Sure you will, Yuya. Sure you will.</br>  <br> Yugo <br> Giving up on Rin <br>but that's wrong</br></br></br>  What did you think of this weeks episode? Is anyone else hoping a super lewd romance develops between Ayame and Tanukichi? Because I sure am!  why dont they just literally fuck  posting lewd ending<br>http://a.pomf.cat/whrorm.webm</br>  is this a smug loli thread now?  <br>When I heard the voice, I almost cried of happiness.</br>  Light took the world's crime rates down by 70%, so why did the government and police try and stop him?  killing is wrong  Because no government wants to admit that some bored high school/college kid can do their job better than them.  <br><br>His way of doing things was wrong.</br></br>  <br>Yet Police and Government kills people every day. Wars, people who commit crimes aka death Penalty. That's a contradiction.</br>  <br><br>Because he didn't enLIGHT them about his plan</br></br>  cause the show wouldnt have a plot if they didnt  <br>Doing whatever it takes to make the world a better place isn't wrong in the slightest. It's wrong to those who believe society is the benefactor to judging a person's fate.</br>  <br> he didn't enlighten them about his keikaku <br>Fixed</br></br>  <br><br>Note: keikaku means plan</br></br>  <br> Doing whatever it takes to make the world a better place isn't wrong in the slightest <br>That's exactly what Hitler thought. Look at what horrible things he did because of that attitude.</br></br>  <br>They knew by the fact that he was willing to commit that much murder just for some fucked-up ideals that he was a volatile and dangerous individual wielding unbelievable power. He had to be stopped because they realized that even as he was using his power for good at the start, he had the ability and the will to take his ideals too far.</br>  <br>If your only claim to your defense is Hitler then you vastly overestimate your side of the argument. Hitler wanted to make the world a better place in high eyes, you're implying that everyone thinks like Hitler which obviously isn't the case.</br>  <br>They do in Japan?</br>  <br>Because he was a notable force that they could not control.</br>  He was breaking the law, and no one is above the law, what he did would not go unpunished, when he took steps to kill off innocent investigators or people who were on their way to stop him is when it stepped into killing their officials. <br><br>Light was certainly cheap and probably reduced all sorts of cost for the government though as housing criminals especially deathrow inmates is not cheap. <br><br>But in plain, he broke the law and could not go unpunished for it. He's not above the law or responsibility.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just because he's correct, it doesn't make him right.</br>  <br>Because crime is money.</br>  <br>so they could get the death note for themselves</br>  Light is a dumbass. He wouldn't have to worry about being stopped if he didn't make himself so easy to track.   MUH KILLING IS WRONG <br> MUH YOU CAN'T PLAY KAMI-SAMA <br> MUH RAITO WAS EVIL <br>Let's get these out of the way.</br></br></br>  <br>He wasn't a social democrat, their humanist ideologies &amp; power base supersede rationality or equally any quest for an ideological good.</br>  Would you actually like to live in a world where any crime can possibly lead to death sentence without due process?  <br>Light was, oddly enough, very local.<br><br>But that can be chalked up to his age really, doubt he had much perspective beyond the peripherally domestic.</br></br></br>  Wasn't he killing people who had already been sentenced for their crimes? He went from killing murderers and rapists to killing petty criminals if I recall. And by the end wasn't he killing people before they even got a chance at trial?  <br>What in the fuck are you going on about</br>  <br>Hitler got rid of 6 million jews, why did everyone want him dead?</br>  <br>It's a translation note.</br>  <br>It does when you have the power. <br><br><br>Truth<br><br><br>When you have power like that, you are above the law. You're above the government and those who produced the law, the people who are known to exploit the law for their benefit. <br><br><br>Truth<br><br> Light is a dumbass. He wouldn't have to worry about being stopped if he didn't make himself so easy to track. <br> <br>Truth</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No one thinks like Light either. Cause he's a sociopath. And crazy</br>  <br>He was killing convicts and any even suspects that he saw on the news.</br>  <br>And if you kill everyone on earth, there will be 0% of crime.<br>Also, he killed some innocent people for his own benefit.</br></br>  <br>Cause he's a mass murderer despite that.<br>Crime rate might go down, but that would be the result solely out of causing terror and striking fear into people.<br><br>There is no excuse for killing thousands.Even if it helped to lower the crime rate, he was still a mere mass murderer himself who had to be brought down.<br><br>Also, those who have power often get seduced by it.Just as it did with Light, who gazed deeper and deeper into the abyss, and the abyss didn't just gaze back but he jumped right in.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> And if you kill everyone on earth, there will be 0% of crime. <br>Judge Dead is that you?</br></br></br>  <br> being this new <br><br>Am I being baited?<br><br> inb4 I was merely pretending </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you are above the law. You're above the government and those who produced the law, <br><br>Obviously not considering they brought him down and he acknowledged them as a threat. I would be silly to think he was so much above them, he's just a man with a book.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It'd be funny if hitler or light didn't die and were jailed instead, they'd get a fuckton of fan mail.</br></br>  <br>And the government is a bunch of old dude in congress, figureheads, etc. What's your point?</br>  <br>Because he wasn't properly elected.</br>  If they didn't stop him, they'd lose their jobs  <br>Because of budget cuts.</br>  <br><br>What's yours? <br><br>They were to stop Light, Light isn't fucking Thanos with the Infinity Gauntlet here, he's within their power they just need to find out who he is to stop him, and they did.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Yet Police and Government kills people every day <br><br>yeah, maybe in third world shitholes like USA. Remember to eat your daily burger too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There is an excuse for killing thousands if it's for a good cause that you believe in. Morality is mankind's biggest setback. You think our worldly peace is done by not killing? Every government on earth has caused at least more than 1 million deaths each in wars they've took part in. So your society would also be included.<br><br>What's good for the goose is good for the gander.</br></br></br>  Because killing criminals to the point where crime ceases to occur leaves the police, judicial and prison systems without work and revenue.<br><br>Oh, yeah, and killing is wrong lel</br></br>  <br> Every government on earth has caused at least more than 1 million deaths each in wars they've took part in. <br><br>I'm pretty sure that's not actually true.</br></br></br>  <br>Government isn't fucking Thanos either, a collective body of people still don't make them better than one person. I thought all killing was evil, but society's proved that wrong. There's two sides to it. And you seem to think that a government (which is known to have just as many corrupt, evil people in it) is better than one man handing out the justice the world needed? I don't agree with that.</br>  <br>Yeah. <br><br>Let's say he killed 20 innocent fucks. <br><br>Who cares? He saved MILLIONS with that, hell. Billions probably</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>USA was built off wars and murder<br><br>China was built off wars and killing to unite nations<br><br>Two of our biggest countries got their start off murder.</br></br></br></br></br>   there are still 30% of criminals who aren't afraid of kira. <br>who are those based heroes?</br>  <br>As a warning to any "L" wannabe I would've started killing world leaders and banksters left and right.</br>  <br> Am I being baited? <br> &gt;inb4 I was merely pretending <br>Do you want him to say he was pretending or not? Choose one you stupid faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Those are two governments.</br>  <br>"Every employee and share holder of 4kids and Funimation."</br>  <br>Probably crimes without meditation. Accidents, etc. Those tend to happen a lot. <br>Crime of passion<br>Since those people weren't thinking when they did it's not that they didn't fear Kira, it's just that their chips went off that moment</br></br></br>  <br>this. also religious leaders. not because of edginess, but just to show everyone that their religion is wrong, which in that universe, it clearly is, since there are death notes and a whole dimension of demons that no religion is aware of, it's pretty clear none of them have the right idea.</br>  <br>Kerry pls.</br>  <br> Government isn't fucking Thanos either <br><br>Uhhh, they don't have to be. Why in the world would they have to? They're a large group of smart people trying to stop a smart man with a powerful weapon that can kill individuals, Light isn't unstoppable and that was proven. <br><br> And you seem to think that a government (which is known to have just as many corrupt, evil people in it) is better than one man handing out the justice the world needed? <br><br>On one hand you have a corrupt man who has to go through a ton of shit and may be stopped by a good on, on the other you have a man trying to build a peaceful utopia off of killing people who don't fit in his idea as he tries to become god, he can change his ideals at any moment, no one man should have the power to decide the fate of the planet, if one day he decided he wants thieves out of the world, they're fucked, if I get falsely charged for being a thief i'm fucked.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's only a selfish excuse.<br>And I'm not as fucked up in my head yet to say it's good because I believe in it cause it still destroyed the lives of others, those left behind.Lovers, friend, family etc.<br>And this peace being caused by killing and wars only proves humans failed as a thinking animal.</br></br></br>  lol at all you morons.<br><br>Light didnt kill anyone. The book did. He did nothing wrong</br></br>  <br>But Kerry didn't save anyone(well the plane would've been a major thing but we don't know) and his innocent count is probably in the Ks considering all the shit he's done. <br><br>Light actually saved people and those innocents he killed were after him so he had no choice.</br></br></br>  <br>Books don't kill people. People kill people.</br>   why is summary execution bad you guys??? <br><br>Every time I start to forget /a/ is populated mostly by people under the age of 21 a thread like this pops up to remind me.</br></br>   be police <br> in 2 months crime goes down 70% <br> no need for me anymore <br> be jobless <br>So, you question is why did the government and police try and stop him?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Himmler didn't kill all those people. The gas did.</br>  Light was going to start killing people for being lazy, he was a nutjob that needed to be stopped  <br>same here</br>  <br>Could you say the same thing if your waifu was on the victim list?</br>  <br> Light actually saved people and those innocents he killed were after him so he had no choice. <br><br>Fuck off, Light was playing with the thought to kill his imouto just so he can continue on his dictator throne.<br>And don't give me "but he didn't do it".<br>The fact he was actually considering it by itself is messed up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  he can change his ideals at any moment, no one man should have the power to decide the fate of the planet, if one day he decided he wants thieves out of the world, they're fucked, if I get falsely charged for being a thief i'm fucked. <br><br>That's your problem, that peace is Light wanted is built off his lies just as the world before Light did his deeds was like. Either way pretending the world is an okay place in either doesn't make it right. You simply agree with society before light because it's better suited for you, but is it better suited for those who are killed by a thief or criminal as you stated? No.<br><br> Uhhh, they don't have to be. Why in the world would they have to? They're a large group of smart people trying to stop a smart man with a powerful weapon that can kill individuals, Light isn't unstoppable and that was proven.  <br><br>By killing light they proved they wanted to be Thanos, they stopped someone who was doing what he seen as right, that doesn't make them any better than him killing off those who knew he was Kira. I'm sure their government has powerful weapons as well. Society and Government doesn't like someone who is on their level or above their level in power. That's why he had to be stopped, not cause of his killings or to protect their people or the world. It was for their own agenda.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can forget we came from animals, your morality is what keeps you back from doing what needed to be done. I bet you'd let someone kill you if they were trying to take your life. Would you kill them if it resorted to that? I doubt it by your response.</br>  <br><br>Because he was executing people who weren't actually convicted yet.<br><br>That's probably the only major reason.<br><br><br><br>I think he actually went after a large amount of international criminals, perhaps mostly as time went on. That's how he caught the attention of the authorities.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Books don't kill people. People kill people...with books. Old people burning old people burning, put your hands up!<br><br> he still believe in gas </br></br></br>  <br>killing innocent people is never ok</br>  because he was playing god, and no human is allowed to do that  <br><br>Because if he did their job efficiently without needing tax dollars, then they could just lay off most of the police departments and no-one would care.</br></br>  <br>I consider killing people that piss me off, doesn't mean I will do it. <br><br>Normal people think things all the time, rape, murder, shit like that.<br>What differentiates them from psychos is that they have the brain to stop themselves. Psychos just do what they want</br></br></br></br>  <br>Also, Ryuk said there's not Heaven nor Hell</br>  <br>He wasn't playing god. He had a notebook that literally turned him into a god of death. <br><br>He was pretty much a demi-god.<br><br><br>There's no heaven or hell and normal people just vanish. People that use the Death Note go somewhere else  become Shinigami, probably </br></br></br></br></br></br>   "I'm god! I choose who is good or bad!" <br> use police, justice system, and prison system to decide <br><br>I never understood this</br></br></br>  <br>Why would I kill them?<br>I would disarm or immobilize them at best.<br>And if the grudge against me is too deep, I actually wouldn't mind.</br></br></br>  <br>in a universe where there are demons and no sign of a 'god' anywhere.</br>  <br> That's your problem <br><br>That's the planets problem not just mine alot of people are going to get fucked, false charges and other bullshit will ruin innocents.<br><br> Either way pretending the world is an okay place in either doesn't make it right.  <br><br>Making life a trapzone where one mistake can lead you to heart attack city isn't better, i'm not living in consistent fear that one day for some reason my heart will stop because some unknown deity like being went insane. <br><br><br> By killing light they proved they wanted to be Thanos <br><br>Ryuk killed Light, Light was pretty much going insane and they felt they had to defend themselves. You said light had the power to be above the law, government and those who produce it, they're not IG Thanos for trying to enforce it and succeeding to. Light was just a boy with a deadly weapon. <br><br> I'm sure their government has powerful weapons as well. <br><br>lol, what's your point? <br>We're not dropping a nuke on some suburban neighborhood because some dude there killed a man, and they're certainly not being used to kill off randoms who crimes they committed god knows how long ago. That has nothing to do with anything. We fly drones over places but they're not all over the world and will bomb you for a simple mistake. <br><br>Either all, the original point stands, Light isn't, wasn't above anything, that was proven when he got fucked and begged Ryuk to save him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Thinking you have any right to play god and decide who lives and who dies. <br><br>I bet you're a Griffith sympathizer aswell.</br></br>  he was stupid for not using the methods of death the the notebook gave him. just fucking heart attacks all around. get fucking creative, man.  <br>Which almost happened</br>  <br>Death is equal you goober</br>  <br>Francis, please.</br>  <br>Prison = Profit. He was hurting the private prisons.</br>  <br>He did that on purpose because he wanted people to acknowledge him you dungrus</br>  <br>he could have had people die in different ways, but write 'Kira' with their blood or something before it happens.</br>  All the government cares about is maintaining control. If someone else did their job for them they would be picking up trash on the highway.  <br>That's stupid, then he would blow his cover that he can kill in different ways than heart attacks which for a while was his silver bullet</br>  <br> Ryuk killed Light <br><br>After he was shot how many times by police?<br><br><br> Making life a trapzone where one mistake can lead you to heart attack city isn't better, i'm not living in consistent fear <br><br>So you agree you stick to a pretend society because you fear the a new one. You're ok with people being killed by regular criminals and crimes happening the way society dictates them to be.<br><br> lol, what's your point? <br><br>No but they send police and in many incidences, police are killed by said dude who killed a man. Sending people to their death, whether they signed up for it or not is wrong as well right? where do you draw the line?<br><br> Either all, the original point stands, Light isn't, wasn't above anything, that was proven when he got fucked and begged Ryuk to save him. <br><br>You basically here proved they wanted to be Thanos, They shot him prior to Ryuk killing him. Arresting him was an option but they knew light would never allow they. They were ready to kill him at any time. That makes them no better than him killing. They're all murders. Light, The Government, etc. And you're not going to try and convince me he was wrong for what he did or government killing is justified moreso than his.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>how is it a 'cover', exactly? they already know he can kill without meeting or being close to the person.<br>doing different things will only throw off whoever's trying to get him.</br></br>  <br>Hate to say it, but that's a slippery slide there. Doing whatever it takes to make the world a better place according to your beliefs might be right for you, but not for other people. Who the fuck gave you the right to impose your morals over others?<br><br>Also there's a neat little board for all this </br></br></br>  <br>because he was an edgelord</br>  <br>The death note you stupid motherfucker.</br>  <br>They didn't know he could basically control people before they die.</br>  <br><br> After he was shot how many times by police? <br><br>After Light went insane and was making a move to kill them they acted in self defense as Light is a dude who was able to kill men miles away. They have no idea what trick up his sleave he could've had. Also he wasn't killed by the gunshots so again, what's your point? They were corrupt for shooting him while he was making a move to kill them all? What should they have done? Ask him politely to stop and read him his rights? <br><br> So you agree you stick to a pretend society because you fear the a new one. You're ok with people being killed by regular criminals and crimes happening the way society dictates them to be. <br><br>People are still going to be killed by regular criminals regardless, it wont happen often but it'll still happen, shit like rape, assault, burglary, theft will also still happen and when the murders die down cries for criminals to die will continue and petty crimes will face judgement with it. <br><br> No but they send police and in many incidences, police are killed by said dude who killed a man. Sending people to their death, whether they signed up for it or not is wrong as well right? where do you draw the line? <br><br>It's a risky job, accidents happen, it's just something we have to live by, and it's something that's obvious for those who sign up. <br><br> Sending people to their death, whether they signed up for it or not is wrong as well right? <br><br>It's on no ones except the criminals fault and no one but the criminal is to blame, they are punished by law and we mourn them afterwards. <br><br> You basically here proved they wanted to be Thanos, They shot him prior to Ryuk killing him <br><br>Because he tried to fucking kill them. <br><br> Arresting him was an option  <br><br>Fucking what? Did you want them to ask him to put his hands behind his back while he was writing their names down or something?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the Death Note gave you the ability to kill, not any right. You obviously can, and people will obviously try to get you.</br>  <br> After he was shot how many times by police? <br>Ryuk knew his lifespan from the very beginning. He knew he'd survive and spend his life in prison so he 'spared' him that fate.</br></br>  <br>Anon there is a serious flaw with a single person holding all the power. It can go wrong in so many ways, it's not worth the risk. We saw Light in the end killing everyone that got in his way because he wanted to impose his ideals on everyone.</br>  <br>but even they did know, how will they effect him badly in any way? it'll just add to his mythos.</br>  because he acted above the law, and could indiscriminately kill anyone anywhere right out of the fucking blue.<br><br>Light's actions had the side effect of curbing crime, but they were ultimately not the end goal. Rather, his delusions of grandeur gave way to a god complex, and so punishment no longer meant anything as a function of people defacing the law, but instead as a function of how undesirable that person is to Light's little kingdom.<br><br>To make a long story short, he's a hypocrite, no better than the criminals he killed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>BTFO</br>  <br> police literally haven't killed a single person in 50 years <br> sandniggers don't count <br>guess the country</br></br></br>  <br>Did he became a shinigami or not.</br>  <br> Light took the world's crime rates down by 70%, so why did the government and police try and stop him? <br><br>Being a vigilante = criminal act<br>Killing = criminal act</br></br></br></br>  <br>If he was ever caught he could force one of them to kill the others somehow, they would never see it coming. It's just a measure to really make sure.</br>  <br>You can take the world's crime rates down by 100% by killing everyone too</br>  <br>Because they want people to believe and depend on them. Governments wouldn't care as much, if he didn't start doing it as Kira and on far lesser scale, so they could be try covering it somehow up. With enough time people would start rioting saying police isn't needed, next step would be choosing Kira as new world king.<br>I might not remember well, but I think in begining Light killed only criminals with really long (lifelong?) sentences, while later started killing more people, just to keep killing and still 'exist' in people's mind. He took it too far.</br></br>  <br> Look at what horrible things he did <br>name some</br></br>  <br>Hitler tried to better all of society by forcing everyone to be a functioning member and extinguishing those that could not be or that hindered society. Why in the fuck the the allies want to go against a man trying to make the world into a utopia? <br> It's the same principal. Hippies don't get it and this is more of a society kind of question to a /a/ one.</br></br>  <br>Genocide? War crimes? Even if you're a holocaust denier, you can't deny the war crimes.<br><br>There's a reason some of his top generals wanted him out.</br></br></br>  <br> Though his issue wasn't necessarily absolute power.</br>  <br>He was taking advantage of his situation, and weeding out the weak links</br>  Holy shit it was never about his taking their job or just maintaining order. It was about how you can't give a person that kind of power and except him not to decline into a slippery slope. Eventually Light would start killing people for minor things like littering and then society would be afraid to do anything ever.  <br>Weeding out the weak links includes massacring innocent civilians?<br>Also, Hitler without his generals = shit at war.</br></br>  <br>Thats a terrible argument because he gets all of his victims from national and international news which doesn't cover minor criminals. If he started persecuting minor criminals based out of his local newspaper (or even ordering others) he would be easy as shit to track down.</br>   M-MUH LAWS! <br><br>Most countries don't have laws against using magic.</br></br>  <br>The allies committed just as many as Germany and the Soviets. Of course you know that isn't included in history books or shows but you can ask surviving soldiers.</br>  <br><br>Same reason they stop vigilantes.</br></br>  <br>Are you new to law? The law doesn't stipulate every single means or weapon of committing a murder. There might be some differentiation when it comes to things like firearms, but if they can show you used lethal force with intent with your magic then its all the same.</br>  <br>Because he was someone that the bigwigs (the government) couldn't control so he needed to be eliminated<br><br>The police just enforce the will of the government</br></br></br>  <br>But vigilantes <br><br> Often attack people who are merely under suspicion of a crime <br> Have dangerous methods of acquisition that can harm others in the area <br> Are not able to be held accountable like officers are until apprehended <br><br>Light was killing people who were already convicted of crimes without any risk to people nearby. You could argue that its not his right to override court ruling, but the show demonstrated that he definitely achieved positive results globally.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no. He just died like a bitch and will be forgotten within a generation. His smug sense of self importance drove him to throw away every possible chance at happiness so he could become "a god of a new world" which wouldn't even last.</br>  <br>There aren't rules about using otters too but if you kill someone by smashing his skull with an armored otter it's still murder sherlock</br>  <br>Didn't he say at one point "I will show the world that opposing Kira will get you killed or something like that?</br>  <br>Someone with the intent of stopping someone from killing criminals in a safe and efficient manner once proven guilty is no better than a criminal.</br>  <br>That might be the case if you threw fireballs in broad daylight.<br>You'd only need to destroy the book and there would be no evidence at all.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128035112 <br>mad as fuck</br>  <br><br>Because crime is useful.</br></br>  <br>He gassed 6 million innocent Jews.</br>  <br>yes we all know light is a massive retard for losing even with magic<br>every single guy in this thread could fool the whole world if he had the death note</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128035232 <br>ok</br>  <br> The allies committed just as many as Germany <br>[citation needed]</br></br>  <br>You make the police sound evil.</br>  <br><br> yazuka work under the government/elite's umbrella <br> yakuza don't kill people <br><br>Don't you have to practice your katana skills in preparation for moving to glorious Japan, faggot?</br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128035112 <br> discussing the plot of an anime is not anime related <br>muh imageboard</br></br>  <br><br> Light was killing people who were already convicted of crimes without any risk to people nearby. <br><br>So was pic related and look at how he ended up.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128035112 <br>Global rule 7<br>Replying to a thread stating that you've reported or "saged" it, or another post, is also not allowed.</br></br>  <br>Japan practiced the death penalty last time I checked.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128035469 <br> ethics and killing are unrelated to an anime about ethics and killing <br>go back to your fate thread</br></br>  <br>Because muh feels.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128035620 <br>no, you are just a whiny shit</br>  <br>Because they're edgy retards.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128035786 <br>what are you going to do about it</br>  So many incorrect life livers in this thread.  I never realised Light is a libertarian hero.  <br>the government were afraid the dn would be used against them.<br><br>besides, that note is a really valuable wepaon. even more valuable than nukes.</br></br></br>  <br>You might be more powerful than the law, but that doesn't mean you aren't held accountable by someone for your actions. And you can try to stop them from finding you out, as Light tried, but eventually you goof up (as he also did)</br>  <br><br>Because his improvements were only temporary.<br><br>And there were hints that the next step of his brilliant plan was eugenesia for the poor, lazy and stupid people.</br></br></br></br>  <br> libertarian hero <br><br>What? He's a textbook definition of a tyrant.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That was Mikami getting ahead of himself.</br></br>  <br><br>Ryuk was a blatant liar though.</br></br>  The power of final judgment really shouldn't reside in a demonstrably unstable college kid. And what do you know, as soon as someone started turning up the heat he started killing innocents to protect his position. He was a coward, he wasn't fit to rule, and he died like a rabid dog without anyone but the police knowing who he was.  <br>He was explaining one of the rules of the DN though.</br>  <br> people don't kill people, guns kill people </br>  <br><br>Well, it is true.<br><br>Do you think a pussy bitch like Light could kill anyone with his own hands?<br><br>It was the book the one who gave him the ability of killing people from the distance without dealing with any sort of direct consequences.<br><br>Its kinda like school shooters, most of 'em are pussy bitches too until they get their hands on some OP artifacts like guns and explosives.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If I had the book I'd just fuck over society.<br> Kill off the entire presidential succession line <br> we power struggle now <br> Drop foreign politicians left and right <br> Christians start saying it's the will of god <br> drop them shortly after for the lols. world war in no time as all governments become too unstable to keep the state together. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying any Jew is innocent </br>  <br> Jews <br> Innocent <br>pick one</br></br></br>  <br> gassing kikes <br> bad <br>HAHA le xD literally xd'd xD</br></br></br>  <br>Most serial killers did it using cowardly methods.

The general idea in stopping him was not that he was evil or that he was not making the world a better place, but that he had power over them. Much of government and police are out for their own gain, not to make the world a better place. And then there are the people who think what he did is morally wrong. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Nonsense.<br><br><br>Highly opinionated. <br><br><br><br>These.<br><br><br>Self-defense.<br><br><br>He was incredibly thoughtful about most of his moves, with a select few slip-ups that should be very hard for anyone to catch on to.<br><br><br>Irrelevant.<br><br><br>A lot of it became rumors/myths. Many of the killings were done by other people with death notes. Undoubtedly, he made some errors at some point though.<br><br><br>Light is far from a sociopath. At least until the last couple episodes.<br><br><br> innocent <br>Well, he killed people that would have prevented him from continuing. He never just went at random.<br><br><br> There is no excuse for killing thousands <br>Saving millions? What about war? Those have existed and many of the people responsible for them aren't punished in any way. <br><br><br>Many of them volunteered to go after kira. <br><br><br>They didn't know that. Only L speculated that. <br><br><br> Every government on earth has caused at least more than 1 million deaths each <br>Yeah, that's not true at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If the death note has infinite pages, shouldn't that mean it also has infinite mass? How is it not tearing the entire universe apart?  <br>Whatevs I gave my reasoning, pretty much all conservatives are in favor of the death penalty, but would you say they're edgy?</br>  he was a megalomaniac  <br>Also keep in mind, I never said suffering. When Light killed his victims, it was always a simple heart attack, which in itself can be painful, but doesn't come close to gruesome suffering.</br>  <br> Irrelevant. <br>It's fucking not</br></br>  <br>i know he killed one dude in a car accident, and i'm pretty sure he killed more in similar ways</br>  <br>Sure did. Point?<br><br><br>People who didn't think they would get caught, didn't think their crimes were severe enough, didn't think they were committing a crime to begin with, committed a crime in the heat of the moment, and people who just don't give a fuck (likely out of stupidity).<br><br><br>That would cause chaos. He is looking to make the world a better place.<br><br><br>They'd become martyrs. Religious people are perfectly fine with that. He'd have to kill off followers to strike fear into the people who actually do care if they die. <br><br><br> /a/ is populated mostly by people under the age of 21 <br>Is that actually true?<br><br><br>That's speculation and unlikely. <br><br><br>A sacrifice in order to save more of other people's imouto's that would be lost to crimes.<br><br><br> Because he was executing people who weren't actually convicted yet. <br>Has nothing to do with it.<br><br><br>They didn't go after him so police can have jobs. The government thinks of police as an expenditure and would happily fire all them given the chance.<br><br><br> Normal people think things all the time, rape, murder, shit like that <br>No they don't. <br> they have the brain to stop themselves <br>They are afraid of the repercussions. <br><br><br>It's been awhile, but I thought he essentially said 'he didn't know of one', not that he was certain here wasn't one. Regardless, he was capable of lying/being wrong.<br><br><br>He didn't kill people based off the decisions made by the police/justice systems/prison systems. He just used those to find people, who would would then decide if they were deserving or not. He simply did not have the power nor time to go out and find people himself and actually make a worldwide change.<br><br><br>Irrelevant. There is no sign of god anywhere in our universe, yet people still cling to that quote. Only a select few people knew of the shinigami.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You might want to give more than one example, it sure would help your case :)</br>  <br>Did you forget about such thing as monopoly of violence? Basically Kira is criminal for doing government job and should be killed.</br>  <br><br>I think someone triggered an unironic DN emo.</br></br>  There's nothing wrong with absolute power or innocent people dying to protect that power if the person with the power is fair and sane. History has plenty of examples of it going swimmingly. Light was fucking insane though so why wouldn't they stop him?    <br>  Light was fucking insane <br>No. He isn't. What is even his disorder? Can you name one?</br></br>  <br>not that guy and never even watched it but he seems a dead ringer for delusions of grandeur</br>  <br>He's an asshole and sells out people who were helping him</br>  <br>Kek<br>This dude has been waiting for this shit for a long time</br></br>  <br>he's a narcissist and a sociopath, at the very least.</br>  <br>Are you kidding me? <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_<wbr>triad<br>Tell me that doesn't sound like light</br></wbr></br></br>  <br> i'm not living in consistent fear that one day for some reason my heart will stop because... <br><br>What difference does it make why you die? Your chance of dying is much less when the crime rate is so low, even with the extremely off fluke that the one dude with a notebook kills you by mistake. Either way, you are much more likely to die in a car accident, or your heart stopping due to cheeseburgers. You should be in more constant fear of death right now than if you lived in that universe.<br><br><br>Then people wouldn't be able to pin everything on him. I would have made it something incredibly rare. I wouldn't want a normal heart attack on an important person getting pinned on me when I wasn't responsible. <br><br><br>Because this way he can keep specific killing secret if he wanted to. This is why you would make a shitty Kira. No brain.<br><br><br> right for you, but not for other people <br>In this case, the other people is 99.9% criminals. If the world is right for 99.9% of innocent good people, and wrong for 99.9% of criminals, instead of a 50/50, I'm okay with that. <br> Who the fuck gave you the right to impose your morals over others? <br>Ryuk.<br><br><br>What gives you the right to not kill people then? 'rights' is silly terminology for 'capability, with arbitrary morals tacked on.<br><br><br>If the single person is better than the conglomerate, then it is better for them to have all the power, but with advisers. Spreading the power leaves less risk, at the cost of less chance of improvement. For example, we now have the capability of self-driving cars. If one person was in control, they could mandate all other cars to cease production, and require all cars to be self-driving. This would significantly decrease the amount of automobile accidents, and save countless lives. This won't be done though, because the power is spread. It's going to take a long time before everyone is agreement, and lives are being thrown down the drain because of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Because once you eliminate all "real" criminals you start killing people who do small misdeeds.<br><br>Look at the Russian and French revolutions and how they treated "criminals".</br></br>  <br> What difference does it make why you die? <br><br>It's Light behind the book, hes so mentally unstable in creating his own utopia it wouldn't shock me if he went full /pol/ and killed everything he found unfit to live in his new world.</br></br></br>  <br> because he acted above the law <br>Solid 3rd grade logic.<br> side effect of curbing crime, but they were ultimately not the end goal <br>Nope, it was the end goal.<br> his delusions of grandeur gave <br>They weren't delusions, he had grandeur.<br> god complex <br>And rightfully so.<br> defacing the law <br>Again with the law. Light doesn't give a shit about the law. He cares about good and evil. Which is how anyone with a functioning brain should think.<br> little kingdom <br>You are being condescending to a fictional character.<br> he's a hypocrite, no better than the criminals he killed <br>Nope, but you sure are a moron.<br><br><br>I don't think there's any official answer on this.<br><br><br>Point?<br><br><br>Sure could. But he didn't have to kill 70% of criminals in order to make the crime rate go down by 70%. He didn't even kill 1% of criminals, much less of the population, from my understanding. <br><br><br> just to keep killing and still 'exist' in people's mind <br>Nah, there were still 30% of crimes left. He made a large improvement, but he didn't reach anywhere near the end goal.<br><br><br>Hitler did much more than that.<br><br><br> and expect him not to decline into a slippery slope <br>Nonsense. They weren't afraid of him taking it too far, they already thought he did. And even if they didn't, and were 100% certain that he wasn't going to, they still would stop him. They don't want anyone to have more power than themselves.<br><br><br>Actually, it pretty much does. If they can't explain how the death note kills, they wouldn't be able to convict on it. Just like, if I popped a balloon, and someone had a heart attack, I wouldn't be convicted of murder. <br><br><br>This.<br><br><br>Sure is. If it smashed their skull that's considered a blunt weapon.<br><br><br>Yes he did. Opposing kira is preventing the world from being a better place. He wouldn't kill people for not liking kira, but directly opposing him to prevent him from making a better world is an act of evil inHisMind.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>what the fuck is wrong with you? go away</br></br>  <br>He gassed six trillion jews.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br> THE ABSOLUTE STATE OF THIS GUY  <br><br>90% of the people you're replying to are more than likely doing something better with their time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's been almost 9 years since I last saw Death note. Time to watch it again I guess.This makes me realize it'd take nearly a decade before I would consider rewatching some things.   this thread   <br>There's a drama airing right now, the second episode is gonna be subbed soon. It's kind of hilarious</br>  <br> every single guy in this thread could fool the whole world if he had the death note <br><br>Clearly not everyone in this thread, but many of us. Anyway, we simply wouldn't have someone like L to try to stop us, nor would we have the belief that we can eliminate all acts of crime. I'm sure most wouldn't use it, some would use it for personal gain, a few would use it to take out a select few priority high risk people, and the select .01% of us would do some Light level crazy shit with no exception of actually achieving our goal (but instead, with more of a Ryuk mindset of 'this could be interesting'). <br><br><br>This.<br><br><br> but eventually you goof up <br>Maybe, maybe not.<br><br><br> his improvements were only temporary <br>That's the thing though. At the point he got to, sure they were temporary. But if a large enough change to society was made (crime down to .001%) it would likely have a significant lasting impact, even once Kira killings stopped. <br><br><br> The power of final judgement really shouldn't reside in a demonstrably unstable college kid <br>I'd argue, his hands were the best for it. Most people who could do a better job than him, wouldn't attempt to.<br><br><br>Pages replenish at an equal rate of their destruction.<br><br><br>Except it is. People don't' want to live in that world, nor do they want to live in a world with criminals, nor do they want to live in a world were they can die in general. They want everything to be perfect. It can't happen. Not only that, people want things they would regret. They aren't smart, their opinions are irrelevant. What matters is whether the world is better for them or not, not whether they 'think' it 'would' be better for them or not.<br><br><br>I'm not emo. I just like showing people why they are stupid. It's a hobby of mine. <br><br><br> Light was fucking insane though so why wouldn't they stop him <br>They (rightfully) believed him to be incredibly calculated and intelligent.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> a drama <br><br>oh yeah.

If the president of the United States thinks of himself as an important person, he isn't narcissistic. Same goes for Light.<br> sociopath <br>Arguably by the end of the show. Throughout the rest of it, not at all.<br><br><br>It doesn't sound at all like light.<br><br><br>Speculation. You can't just assume that's what he's going to do and punish him on that.<br><br><br>It's not impossible, but it's also not something that would be worth worrying about. Just like (I suspect) you don't worry about a massive sun flare/asteroid/etc demolishing all life on this planet. You have an irrational fear of something being decided by human hands, even with equal likelihood.<br><br><br><br>Hi. I'm right though, right?<br><br><br>It's funny (and expected) how people side with different characters when they watch the show when they are younger verse when they are adults.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I watched the first episode live, Misa-misa is a fucking hag.</br>  <br>Light's not even a genius at the start. The description of it I see on nyaa says that he grows into it apparently</br>  <br>I don't know, it seems like a likely explanation though. It's just a detail that's not worth getting caught up on.</br>  <br>Japanese interment camps? Killing the injuns, slavery?</br>  <br>Who the fuck are you? This isn't some shitty forum board, well it is, BUT who are you to spat the fucking rules?</br>  <br>How is interning the Japanese comparable to gassing millions of Jews?</br>  <br>Where is your proof of that?</br>  Who is pissed that L died?  <br> how people side with different characters when they watch the show when they are younger <br><br>I leaned more toward Light's view when I was younger, pretty sure I would categorically side with L's side now.</br></br></br>  <br>Of what?</br>  <br>L was really interesting as a stand alone character. I wonder if he would have been put to better use in another series. Do you think the mangaka shot himself in the foot by killing him off, never to be able to appear in a spin-off past the point of his appearance in DN?</br>  <br>I am so sorry that your reading comprehension is shit.</br>  <br>He should of faked his death then reviled himself at the end to light. L's replacement was shit.</br>  <br>There's always prequels.<br><br>Like BB.</br></br></br>  I'm sure North Korea has a low crime rate too.  Protip: If you agree with Light then you're a fascist.

Other half is purely for aesthetic purposes.</br>  <br>I'm too autistic about wanting to see every thread to not connect the two for others who want to see all threads.</br>  <br>Nothing to do with generals, dumblord. It's just a matter of find threads easily. Simply putting the name of the series in the filename renders the thread filterable and searchable. Not everyone wants to dumpsterdive in a board full of inane garbage like /a/</br>  Is there a kill count about the zombies shovel has killed until now? I bet around a few dozens  <br>Fuck off, generalfag.<br><br><br>Then fuck off and stop coming here, shitposter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck off fatefag/klkfag</br>  <br>git gud faget</br>  <br> Then fuck off and stop coming here, shitposter. <br>No you fuck off with your "general" bullshit. You are the one who brought this nonsense here.<br><br><br>I caught that thread too because of the "kurumi" filter. Gotta use every possible keyword in case some subhuman memester such as  decides to make a thread.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fuck off, generalfag. <br>Answer the question.</br></br>  <br>Gotta use every possible keyword because /a/ never cared about this shit in first place, except for the cancerous generals. It's often better that there's an easy to find thread to contain shitposters anyway, and simultaneously a slower, harder to find thread, at least in the case of popular shows.</br>  <br> memester <br>An archive search shows this word is a /v/ meme. No wonder the /v/-/vg/ shitposter wants to force everything into one general and hate the board while still going on it.<br><br><br>This is 4chan. That's how this site works, except for /vg/, which was created to remove generals from /v/ because they were causing problems there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are the only fucktard here who keeps shitposting about "generals".</br>  <br>There's at least two of us in this thread, and it's necessary to inform you that trying to shut down on-topic threads because you don't want to have more than one at a time is shitposting.</br>  <br>The only thing that needs to be shut down is your whorish mouth. If you didn't like that nerd's cross-thread link, then you should have ignored it instead of shitting up the thread with your crusade.</br>  So why did the gook translator go full retard in that one manga thread?<br><br> loli is an obvious fucking stuffed bear <br> idiot tries his absolute best to deny it, dipping to tumblr-level delusions <br><br>what the fuck<br>I hope deel comes back soon, this guy is gonna ruin the translations so that his headcanon comes true</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why do koreans get raws faster than the japanese?  <br>You're the one with the crusade. Your meta argument was already shitting up the thread, so ignoring you would only encourage shitting up threads by allowing you to think the board is OK with you demanding generals.</br>  <br>I never tried to get a thread shut down. I only linked the two threads together.</br>  <br>Get fucked, sperg, nobody asks for generals.</br>  <br> I'm so good I need to hide my filter <br>Well thanks for linking the threads</br></br>  <br> Why did you make a thread when there's already one up? <br>You clearly promoted the idea that new threads shouldn't be made when there's already one up. You asked for a justification of this thread's existence, which implies you think its existence isn't justified. You initiated meta discussion.<br><br>Furthermore, as  mentioned, linking threads is likely to result in trolls and arguments spreading from one thread to another.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How do I make 4chan look like yours?</br>  <br>It says right there in the post.</br>  <br> How do I make 4chan look like yours? </br>  <br>Remember before the catalog was built in to 4chan?

I have no idea how I would evenn figure out how to change it.</br>  <br>Welcome to Left4dead with cute girls  which later turns into DayZ </br>  <br>so it's high school of the dead but the girls are cute?</br>  <br><br>How come not many manga magazines have online editions in Japan? I wish I could just buy an ebook.</br></br>  <br>Read the manga.</br>  <br><br>here ya go<br>http://catalog.neet.tv/a/</br></br></br>  <br>Never saw HSotD, but probably it's quite different.</br>  What is the best "terror face" in the manga so far?  <br> I wish I could just buy an ebook. <br>I wouldn't mind paying for that. It works wonders for lights novels (kindle, bookwalker, etc).<br>Comic Walker is the closest thing we have for manga, I think.</br></br></br>  <br>Think HotD but without any males in the group, less tittymonsters, no bus orgy cults, and far less emphasis on zombie slaying (though it does happen). Basically, HotD but actually good.<br><br>Seriously, tell me you wouldn't fuck this shovel. I'd call you a liar if you did.</br></br></br>  <br>HotD, but the girls are cute, PTSD and also no loli piss  and the mangaka hasn't quit yet </br>  <br>Filename.</br>  <br>   yet <br>Don't even think about it.</br></br>  The uni sluts are trouble.<br><br>Especially this girl, the bike gang gotta be her bf or something. Or she might be a lezzi and would try to rape Miki or something.</br></br>  <br> bike gang <br>Shieet no pls no men in my gurashi.</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't mind seeing that last one. I do think they're trouble though. Something bad is going to happen and it'll be their fault.</br>  <br>Oh boy, I bet these guys in uni use her to lure male survivals that are passing by. She's pure sex.</br>  <br>My bet is that  at least one of them has been bitten and they know they need more medicine to keep themselves running. Maybe they think the girls some, specially if they figured out Kurumi is also infected after witnessing her superhuman display against crossbow-kun. </br>  <br>wait, this got an anime?</br>  <br>Too bad fam, the author already include a Daryl in the manga. <br><br><br><br>I like what some other anon say, that somehow the bike gang go through and Kurumi is separated from the rest of the gang, and are forced to kill one of the guy with her superzombie strength, she end up partially eating one of them, Miki see it.</br></br></br></br></br>  Please tell me this has NOTHING in common with Highschool of the Dead and I will gladly watch it.  <br> they're outcasts because they're all infected <br> they lure in men who may have medicine using their bodies, then murder them <br> they work with the men in the helmets to lure unsuspecting survivors to their hideout so that they can steal their shit and kill them off in their sleep <br>I just can't bring myself to trust any of them, glasses especially.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Both revolve around high schoolers in the zombie apocalypse. That's pretty much all they have in common aside from the boner-inducing art both have.</br>  <br>So far no edgy bullshit, and tumorous boobs. The author do include some delicious fatty.<br><br>But recent chapter just added a bike gang and some slutty looking college gals, so you know. I hope the author don't go full retard and add some rape or some bullshit. The girls are already traumatized and PTSDed even without some rape.</br></br></br>  <br> Both revolve around high schoolers in the zombie apocalypse <br><br>Well yes, that I was aware of. But HotD was utter shit. I don't want to repeat the same mistake twice.</br></br></br>  Koreans are 2 chapters ahead, right?<br><br>This is unacceptable.</br></br>  <br>I think the helmet guys might actually be afraid to get into the uni because they know the girls are infected.</br>  <br><br>Why won't they share their Japanese raws?</br></br>  <br><br>Not anymore, faggot. We got them translated last night.</br></br>  <br>GG doesn't have the characters mowing down hundreds of zombies with guns and blades, so yeah.</br>  <br><br>Thread last night had ch. 36 and 37<br>Shit was great</br></br></br>  <br>I know, but no, I'm not desperate enough to read this nida "translated" shit.<br><br>I'd rather have jp raws.</br></br></br>  <br>The translator are full blown autist though.<br>Or really good at pretending to be retarded.</br></br>  <br><br>He was merely pretending</br></br>  <br> crossie <br>The most surefire way to spot a tryhard fag</br></br>  <br> There's no such thing as board culture! <br> /a/, /v/, and /co/ are very similar to each other! <br><br>Surefire way to spot corssie scum.<br><br>Oh how I wish /a/ could separate from the rest of 4chan.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds good. I also expect no political soapbox like in HotD.<br><br>brb, downloading</br></br></br>  <br>The zombies. That's pretty much all the common they got.</br>  <br>+other survivors are the worst enemies</br>  <br>This is pretty much the first time they have contacted other people, besides Pilot-kun indirectly.</br>  Big tits crazy will cause their death  How come the other girls didn't notice that Yuki is not talking to Megu-nee any more?  Never heard anything about the series besides it has zombies, and holy shit after watching the first episode, I can't but be excited.<br> dat Moe as fuck intro and settings <br> teacher telling her she can't go home.  <br> the barricaded halls <br> the cross in the garden with the shot of Shovelifu looking at the field  <br> the young girl acting nervous every time she entered a class room <br> dat great reveal <br>Finally a zombie anime that's  hopefully  good.<br>Its only been one episode, so shit can change, but for not its my anime of the season.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't they notice she became more reliable?</br>  <br>Manga is genuinely good, I think the best of all the zombie-related media I've seen. Though anime suffers from the low budget.</br>  <br>Because they're not about the same thing, dipshit. The other thread is about how they fucked up the first episode and this one is about their uniforms. Stop encouraging generals.</br>  <br>Shit then, I gotta check it out.<br>How many chapters are there right now?</br></br>  <br>36<br>38 if you can read korea</br></br>  <br>37, counting the ones that were translated yesterday.</br>  <br><br>Thanks<br>Going to read the first few chapters later today.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah now they have to take care the the big tities retard and the bear loli.</br>  <br>If that is the case with this show, I don't want to imagine what would happen with an "I am a Hero" adaptation.<br><br>Live action movie or bust.</br></br></br>  Has anyone compiled the translated chapters from last night? I want to send the chapter to someone.  Do their names have any hidden meanings?<br><br><br>Check the archive, there's a mega link.</br></br></br>  <br>Shovel's "Shovel" is a reference to shovel she always wields.</br>    <br>They do notice, they comment on how they forgot to ask Megu-nee when they changed cars.<br><br>Though really the cat was out of the bag when Yuki answered the door of the shelter with a baseball bat raised.</br></br></br>  <br>fixed that for you</br>  <br>oops</br>  does manga have detail school plan? they are currently living on 2nd and 3nd floors on booth school wings? <br>Where do they get he water supply? i don't see any water tower on the roof</br>  <br>Yuki Takeya: 丈槍 由紀<br>Kurumi Ebisuzawa: 恵飛須沢 胡桃<br>Yuuri Wakasa: 若狭 悠里<br>Miki Naoki: 直樹 美紀</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you think every person who works in a skyscraper takes the elevator down to the first floor when they need to take a piss or refill the coffee machine?</br>  <br>Maybe the faucets are still working?</br>  <br> Where do they get he water supply? <br>The school was probably built to be able to handle isolation in case of an emergency, so there's probably some sort of water purifier beneath the school which is powered by the solar panels on the roof of the building.</br></br>  <br>They barricaded the staircases, supposedly zombies have problems climbing them. From this layout, I'd say there are 3 entry points on each floor.</br>  <br>The bonus "chapters" explain a bunch of shit I can't read because translation never</br>  <br>I think they mention a rainwater collecting system at some point.</br>  What the fuck? This show is blowing up on nico.  <br>There's no probably about it.<br>Fucking Randall Corporation.</br></br>  <br>Lerche should have focused more on this than the game of laplace.<br><br>They fucked up.</br></br></br>  <br>They probably thought the monster harem show or Laplace would be the one with the most interest.<br><br>This just goes to show people just love the shit out of zombies, regardless of their nationality.</br></br></br>  <br> 940k views <br><br>It's a flop, they said.</br></br></br>  <br>that would make sense but that means they have to go to 1nd or basement floors do do maintenance.<br><br>i don see any water collecting tanks on roof</br></br></br>  <br>She looks like a Saki character, like Toki or Momo.<br>I bet she doesn't wear panties.</br></br>  <br>I don't care much for the zombies.<br>I'm here for the cute girls going through utter hell.<br><br>Shovel Chiyo fanart when?</br></br></br></br>  <br>If it's on the first floor, they could easily divert most of the zombies to somewhere like the gymnasium or something, then have Kurumi kill off stragglers.<br><br><br>She wears  shorts. </br></br></br></br>  <br>How often do you have to do maintenance on this shit, dude, for real?<br>Can't you just accept that it's lasted for over a year without something breaking on its own?</br></br>  The zombies look good, but there is something off about the way they're animated, looks like cgi.<br>I hope they change it.</br>  <br> hating on Work <br>They had shelters and emergency procedures ready and working. As far as the cliche of corporate zombies goes, they're pretty reasonable.<br>(Besides, for all we know, they could have just been studying a zombie virus created by China or something).</br></br></br>  So, this series is a mere cute girls doing cute things, isn't it? Or am I missing anything here. I'm not sure if I even finished the first episode, cause I'm more into edgier animu. I'll gladly watch three episodes if there will be a twist or anything.  So has the anime conquered the Madoka audience?  <br>Oh god that would be cute.<br><br>Someone needs to get on that.</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure the zombies are CGI.</br>  <br>Eh for me she looks more like one of the Oomouro's eldest daughter's groupie.</br>  <br> this series is a mere cute girls doing cute things <br>Pretty much with sometimes zombie action.</br></br>  <br>That expression and the way she never said anything makes me wonder if she's going to be a delusion as well.<br><br>Either that or she's the only zombie / non-zombie in the group.</br></br></br>  <br> edgy <br> Gakkou Gurashi </br></br>  <br>That's unfortunate. I guess they had to cut back somewhere considering Lerche is running 3 shows this season.</br>  <br><br>Can't seem to find anything beyond 35.</br></br>  <br>They're all the in the same year with the exception being Miki.</br>  <br><br>Check the archive and look for a MEGA link</br></br>    Why don't you love me, Taroumaru?!!  Who had the one picture about the heli dood and little girls? I need it again.  <br>mh I failed to detect any zombies so far. I probably turned off too early. I'm actually kinda into zombies.<br><br> sankarea season 2 when? </br></br></br>  <br>I'm here to hear Chino and Chiyo screaming due to PTSD.<br><br><br>It's just temp work anyway. wait for deel next month.<br><br><br>She definitely has a suspicious vibe.<br><br>Fucking author, just make the girls stay in a temple high in the mountain or something, zombie can't climb mountain easily, I remember reading in the WWZ short stories, the japs there end up being alright after hiding in the mountain.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thankfully, this isn't the type of show where they show hordes of them.  They usually imply them, then show the characters shitting themselves out of horror as things get worse.  Lerche's gonna scare the shit out of me when they do start showing the girls experiencing terror. Look at these fucking eyes.</br>  <br>Thanks, found it.</br>  <br>I love the eyes. There's a mini eclipse happening in them that makes it seem like there is a something sinister afoot.</br>   the new girls introduced <br>Well, they didn't shoot at them like the other group, but I'm super scared they're going to kill or hurt one of the main group.<br><br>Please don't do this to me</br></br></br>  <br>They're cannibals, anon, I can feel it</br>  <br>It's the damn irises that make their eyes look unsettling.</br>  <br>They're all suspicious, but hopefully if they're not dicks then they can help Kurumi out. It's either that or that they trick survivors in and eat their flesh to stave off full zombification.</br>  <br> They trap Kurumi since she's the only one that has the capability to defend the others <br> they eat her <br> they all get infected with the virus and die before they can hurt the others </br></br></br>  <br> Everyone thinks they will backstab the main group <br> They will just be new characters that join them </br></br>  <br> eat their flesh to stave off full zombification <br>They might as well be zombies if that's the case.</br></br>  <br> Literally Terminus <br><br>To be honest I don't give much fuck if they were cannibal/thief etcs. I am just afraid they are too much of a slut they are capturing little girls to be used as sex slave for their bf/bike gangs. <br><br>I bet the crossbow kid end up being a good guy. <br><br><br>Glasses looks like 2hu, she must be evil.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I am just afraid they are too much of a slut they are capturing little girls to be used as sex slave for their bf/bike gangs.  <br><br>I don't know if I can handle these girls getting raped, especially since it would probably be Yuki or Rii</br></br></br>  Soon.  <br>If they are evil, then they'll probably give Kurumi the whole "we hybrids are the future, abandon the humans" speech rather than try to kill her.<br><br>On balance, it's probably most likely that they'll do some morally grey stuff but Yuki will end up healing their hearts.<br><br><br> I bet the crossbow kid end up being a good guy.  <br>Nah, Yuki thought he was a bully and that they should leave. Her intuition is always 20/20.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Eh I bet it would be Miki. She is the only (mostly)normal girl left.</br>  Doing a rewatch, holy shit how did I miss this?  <br>Well one of them may die so we keep an even number of characters. That way all the pairings stay set.</br>  <br>Probably. From the way things are going I think the author is setting it up to be where Yuki is the only one that survives the story.</br>  <br><br>Miki will survive, for sure.</br></br>  <br>broken windows</br>  <br>I'd rather the crossbow boy become a harem lead than dealing with /u/ trash.</br>  <br>This series isn't for you then.</br>  Who's that fucking teddy bear girl?<br>Is it really Rii-san's imouto?</br>  <br>I don't see how anyone can think there will be /u/ shit in this show. A group of girls =/= yuri. They're too busy fucking survivng and trying to keep their mental health in check to deal with stupid chemical reactions like romance.</br>  <br>No, it's  a toy </br>  <br>I know, this retard is the one trying to pull some stupid shit  </br>  <br> I am just afraid they are too much of a slut they are capturing little girls to be used as sex slave for their bf/bike gangs. <br>Oh god penis no.</br></br>  Just watched first ep and it totally caught me off guard.<br>What the fucking shit ;_;</br>  <br>Never thought about her before, but she's a pretty good fit. I can perfectly imagine Miho being a backstabbing whore if a zombie apocalypse happened.</br>  <br>Are they all delusional now? you can clearly see them interact with her.</br>  <br>The latest chapters are so damn DayZ that i'm getting my PTSD back from when I played that mod first.<br><br>Those biker-helmets.</br></br></br>  <br> Are they all delusional now? <br>Just like with Yuki before, they're playing along for  Rii-san's  sake.</br></br>  <br>Only Yuki interacts with her, and we already know she's bullshitting her own delusions to keep everyone optimistic</br>   Kirara <br> Thinking there won't be yuri undertones </br>  <br>Read the chapters again.</br>  <br>But Miho is Nadeshiko's gf.</br>  Dumping Chapter 36 for anyone who hasn't read it yet; ignore if you're not caught up.  <br><br>damn how could I miss this, I even turned it off because I thought it's just some loli school drama.</br></br>  <br>And this is just as Kurumi and Miki are becoming closer. It's kinda sad.  ;_; </br>    <br>Please use spoiler filter</br>  <br><br> There are yuri undertones already in ch. 33  </br></br>  <br>Teddy bear girl? Pics or it didn't happen.</br>  <br> Hunting just spawned newds at the beach with my crap loadout </br>    <br> loli <br> the GGs </br></br>  <br><br><br> It didn't actually happen </br></br></br>    <br> yfw she's actually real and the author made the bear outfit to fool us all </br>  Does anyone have the Left 4 Loli picture?  <br>But I thought Ruu was her little sister. How can she not know her name? Does Rii not see Ruu as Ruu?</br>  <br><br>The last obvious one I could spot. If anyone found anymore please share.<br><br> I feel really retarded for not noticing this one. Especially since there was a complete mood swing when they showed this. I guess having tunnel vision when you are convinved this is a shitty moe show really blinds you to the obvious. </br></br></br></br>  <br>There's always time for yuri, buddy.</br>  <br>I don't even know whether to be mad or happy</br>  <br><br> Probably not, I think part of her may know it's not actually her sister, but she's so ridden with guilt that she wants it to be that bad[/sp </br></br>  <br>In that same scene, look and listen to the kids "playing" sports in the field.</br>  <br>The fucking spoiler button not immediately going goddamnit</br>  <br> because translation never <br>Fucking this. To my knowledge there are 4 untranslated bonus chapters, scanned and posted in the archives.

I want to date Cray.    <br>Oh Yuki, playing her role perfectly.</br>    <br>Every time the author makes a panel with these darkened/shadowed faces like the one on the bottom, a part of me dies.</br>  <br> just think of her as Yuki <br> yfw they're talking about Rii in context of Yuki's delusions </br></br>    <br>Fuck I meant this one <br>Damn spoilers confused me.</br></br>  <br>Is 16, so I'll post 17<br>.</br></br>    <br>Shovel is such an operator.</br>  <br> no Ruu </br>    <br> no loli in the image </br>    <br><br>Pretty subtle how he tries to not show Ruu anymore when he switches to Miki or Kurumi as the main point of view.</br></br>   that Graduation chapter <br><br>I expected suffering, not feels.</br></br>    <br><br>Shroedinger's loli</br></br>  Let me get this straight, these bitches will just play along with what ever wild delusion or pretend play that you have?

Who the fuck shoot a girl just because she doesn't want to let go of her doll.</br>  <br>Because zombies don't understand commands</br>  Okay so I'm slightly confused about one thing. Was Miki from another school and if so why does she wear the same uniform? When they showed her backstory with her female friend and the group of other people with the guy who had his hand bit wasn't it at another school?  <br><br>Didn't he try and shoot the doll specifically?</br></br>  <br>Same school. They were in a mall.</br>  <br>Since when the fuck doesn't Rii have a left arm?<br>Cause that has NOT moved from the loli<br><br>I think you're the delusional one m80</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was at the mall. Miki and her friend are from the same schoool, we even could see Miki's friend in the Yuki's delusions in the first episode.</br>  <br>She's from the same school as they are. They went to the mall; when she introduces herself to Yuki she says her name and her class.</br>  <br>Did that little faggot actually try to kill her just because she didn't drop the fucking teddy bear immediately? Why even shout that shit at them in the first place if you planed to shoot at them for a minuscule reason like that anyway?</br>  <br>Center of mass<br>When you're using a crossbow, you wanna connect, and she's holding the teddy close to her chest</br></br>  <br>Is the chapter out already? I'm never up to date on these things. I thought they were not english yet?</br>  <br>People tend to get nervous after the zombi apocalypse</br>  <br>One year junior then the rest of the cast<br><br><br>If he that paranoid, would support the theory that the uni sluts are bunch of half-zombie cannibal.<br><br><br>As if that guy could shout accurately, seem like he's nervous and shit. Incompetent really</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anyone unwilling to do as you say at gunpoint in that sort of situation, no matter how miniscule, you shouldn't trust<br>Actually, especially because it's that miniscule, you should be wary, she could have a gun hidden behind it, and be holding onto it together with the bear</br></br>  <br>I guess missed all the minor notes played throughout the episode too?</br>  <br>Some anon translate that chapter and the next one after that from gook scan.</br>  Dumping chapter 37 now.  <br>They're obviously half-zombie, but we've no idea if they're going to be evil or not. They seem suspicious, but that could easily just be because they're hiding what they are.</br>    <br><br>How are they obviuosly half zombie?</br></br>    REMOVE DOG    <br><br>I fell in love again,<br>I wish she'll take me as a bride.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Didn't she make some kind of comment though like "it must be nice having solar panels for electricity, we didn't have any" or something like that though?</br></br></br>  <br>She's also a fucking slut<br> Choker <br> that shitty hair <br> that shitty earrings <br> all that makeup <br><br>Disgusting</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>     37 <br>WWWWWWWWWWWHAT<br>WEREN'T WE AT 35?<br>WWWWWWWWHAT?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah<br>Because Mii-kun and her friend lived in the mall for a long time, which didn't have the panels</br></br>    <br>NO<br>LOLI</br></br>    <br> even though they're not it, they could be infected <br>Is this implying they're aware of the medicine and also potentially view treated individuals the same as zombies?</br></br>  <br>And the loli's gone again</br>      <br>Too bad they decided to start it 75% into the fucking manga, ruining any chance of it having 2 seasons.</br>  <br>At least threaten them one more time before you start shooting. He was already aiming at them anyway, her pulling out a gun would have just ended in a Mexican standoff. Killing one of them and pissing the rest of the group off while you will have to reload your little crossbow seems like a totally awesome idea too.<br>He just seems to be a little nervous faggot.</br></br>  <br>do manga states how match time passed since virus broke out?</br>    <br>Not that I noticed reading it, at least<br>Probably not much more than a few weeks, though</br></br>      <br> stop  <br> chasing them with bats <br><br>not the smartest guys.</br></br></br></br>      <br>by the look of state of buildings i would say at last half a year or so<br>just look at the school building<br/></br></br>  <br>The manga has dicks now? <br>What the fuck happened? I thought this was a series about loli adventures.</br></br>  <br>They're the good guys, they were trying to protect them from the uni girls.</br>    <br>Literally the Walking Dead.</br>    <br>No loli adventure is complete without the threat of becoming a mindbroken cum toilet</br>  <br>HAHAHA TIME FOR RAPE</br>  <br><br><br><br>There was a poster for the Walking Dead in Radio-chan's hut</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's probably going to be something along these lines, but I dunno why those retards were chasing them with baseball bats in hand in that case.</br>    <br> chase some high school girls with bats and helmets on <br> they drive away <br> STOP <br> stupid bitches, we just wanted to help you <br>What is this? /r9k/ in a zombie apocalypse?</br></br></br></br></br>  Question for mangafags:<br><br> Does this get gory or bloody at all? Looking at the spoilered images it doesn't seem like it does, but I want to know this before I pick it up.<br><br>I can deal with moe being in danger and getting hurt a bit or whatever, but I can't stand gory/ultra violent manga.</br></br> </br></br>    <br>I don't want them to be evil because I love glasses-girl's design<br>But I know they're gonna be horrible people<br>Cannibals, zombie worshippers, a feminazi commune who kills men for fun, or the guys' girlfriends who intend to turn our heroines into sex slaves</br></br></br>  <br>The zombies can be pretty scary, and there's lots of blood.</br>  <br>No gore.</br>    <br>The girl on the left is extremely attractive. Wait no, they all are.</br>  <br> Left girl </br>  <br>Dicks and now sluts too? <br>This is way too much for my ideal loli adventure.</br></br>    <br>Who is the semen demon on the left?</br>  <br><br>Thanks.</br></br>  <br>End of Chapter 37.</br>  <br>I bet in the few chapters they'll be gone and we'll be back to the status quo.</br>  <br>That fucking "just as planned" look.<br><br>That look on her face.<br><br>I don't trust this glasses.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. Most zombies are actually pretty moe. The worst part for you will probably be Megu-nee chapter.</br>  <br>Nah, no, now way, these fuckers are with the bikers for sure. Bandits don't just LEAVE like that.</br>  <br><br>that glasses chick are pure evil.</br></br>  <br>I dunno, they're kinda outnumbered 3:1 as opposed to 2:1</br>  <br> loli <br>why do people keep saying this? They're all at least 17-18 years old with the exception of miki who is probably 16.</br></br>  <br>For retards who decided that it was still profitable to chase after them with a car I'm confused why they gave up so easily at that point. They probably work together with the bitches.</br>  <br>They do if they're against a batch of outcast zombie-hybrids.</br>  <br>Or those bitches use their looks/sexuality to lure unsuspecting survivors into enslavement/sexual slavery/cannibalism/a number of fucked up things</br>  <br>Why do we think they're hybrids, again?</br>  Maybe Kurumi will kill one of them and we'll see her break for the first time.  <br>The status quo got fucked the moment the school was set on fire. Anything can happen now.<br><br><br>It's also possible that the college sluts have something that would make getting on their bad side undesirable.</br></br></br></br>  <br> something that would make getting on their bad side undesirable <br>Like a crazy dude with a crossbow.</br></br>  <br>Crossbow kid was crazy about the idea one of the group might be one, the "a teeny bit different" comment, and it plays into everything that's building up around Kurumi.</br>  Holy shit, this manga is getting scarier by the post.   <br>Or the bitches are infected and the guys know and are afraid to mess with them.</br>  <br>Once they left the High School the zombies stop being the biggest threat- now the big threat is the other survivors</br>  <br>Americans</br>  <br>this is why they should've kept the gun they are high school girls and society has fallen apart they are perfect rape bait</br>  <br><br> We are not survivors <br> We are... the walking dead <br><br>DU DU DUMM</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cue farm arc</br>  <br>Or a hidden stash of zombie medicine.</br>  <br>makes sense they just chase all the new potential fuck slaves into the college and then come back and night and reap their rewards it's easier than chasing them all over the place</br>  <br> Anything can happen now <br> Everyone was just pretending </br></br>  <br>I like that theory, it would nicely lead into the Shovel is still infected arc.  But now I imagine Rii going on a killing spree when she finds out. </br>  <br>They are going to rape Mii-kun.</br>  <br>It's all about keeping you on the edge, making the insanity sweep into your body too.</br>  <br>And that's why I ain't buying the manga/bd/merchandise. I'll drop this manga if the author pull that fucking shit.</br>  <br>They can have a gun when Rii stops being a walking psychosis of the unstable dark kind.</br>  <br>Can't trust this mangaka for a second or he'll fool you into thinking there is happiness</br>  <br>More like fool you into thinking that anything serious is actually ever going to happen.</br>  I can't take this any more. Why can't they be safe? Why can't they just escape, find a permanent cure then get back to their happy school life? There is no way there is going to be a happy ending.  <br><br>Yeah, it's not like they had to leave the school because it caught on fire or anything.</br></br>  <br>It's been 37 chapters, dude, give it some  more  time</br>  I have just read the first chapter of the Manga and the pacing is completely different what the fuck  <br>It's more about the psychological effects than gore.<br><br><br>Yeah, the anime actually handled it better if you ask me. It had better buildup.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If that's all it takes you to convince you that the series is pulling no punches and that anything could happen at any time, well, more power to you, I guess.</br>  <br> Yuki's right hand <br>That's one hell of a border to prevent overlap between characters.</br></br>  <br>They had to end the episode with the twist so it had to be stretched out. Mii-kun and Taroumaru might have been implemented to give extra screentime for the first episode.</br>  <br>Tell me about it, the voices are different too.</br>  <br>I still believe in survival and even some kind of happy ending for Yuki and Miki, but Kurumi and Yuuri are fucked.</br>  <br>How dare you? Mii-kun is mine to rape.</br>  <br><br>Eh, I think plenty has happened man. I think you'd just rather be reading Akame ga Kill</br></br>  <br>Wow, who would have guessed that two completely different mediums would have a different pacing.</br>  Would you?  <br>But he blatantly announced the beginning of neverending suffering.</br>  <br>I'm never going to understand people who think that any currently unresolved problems in an arc are just going to go on forever.</br>  <br><br>Men are scums.<br>Unless you guys are implying the college sluts are the one that's doing the raping. <br><br><br>It's cause most manga never got scanned until completion, or got cancelled midway.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to bite her deliciously small and perky breasts.</br>  So where did the, zombies come from? Is yet another unexplained Zombie plot that will never be resolved ever?  <br>With a baseball bat.</br>  <br>Summer is tough. She is all sweaty.</br>  <br>Umbrella did it.</br>  <br> Unless you guys are implying the college sluts are the one that's doing the raping.  <br>College girls are sluts and should be killed. I'd only spare their lives if I own a group member a favour so he can take fuck them before killing them.</br></br>  <br>I think that was more cause she's going to have to grow up, graduate and put high school club fun behind her. Yuki growing up was one thing that set Rii-san off on needing an imouto to care for and creating one out of the bear, but still. <br><br>Adults in university are fun too, r-right?</br></br></br>  <br>Nothing seriously bad has happened to the main cast. That's not a bad thing, but when a story resorts to repeatedly introducing sympathetic side characters that end up dying, it's usually a pretty good sign that the main characters are unlikely to die themselves but the author wants you to still think that they might.</br>  <br>There's way you could stop me.</br>  <br>It sounds dumb, but that's actually pretty realistic. A company could theoretically manifecture a nano bot/parasitic organism that keeps the corpse moving. Let's say they create it for testing their products on mice more often and it accidentally spreads.</br>  <br> They come from people. Zombies used to be people. </br>  <br>Sure is summer.</br>  <br>Urobutcher get the fuck out.</br>  <br> Everything is gonna be Madoka, guys! <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>Zombies were meant to be a solution to famine by making people edible, tasting chicken.</br>  <br>The zombies creation is not the point as its all a metaphor for depersonalization and/or technology.<br>There is never any point in discussing it, as when you do its always just something that you cover once and its gone forever and it takes suspense out of the story. Why would you ever want to do that in a horror/thriller? If anything, it cheapens it.<br>The Walking Dead comic made it quasi-religious and never revisited it to my knowledge.<br>I'm sure this will be a story that gets to that point nearer to the end so as to give the reader answers to the helidude.</br></br></br></br>  <br> babby's first symbolism </br>  <br> not keeping at least one around as a dumpster <br>The apocalypse can get lonely, dude<br>Sure it's a bit of ration, but not a lot</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nothing seriously bad? I'm not sure how you're defining that. I mean, Rii has gone crazy, Kurumi has been bit and is a ticking time tomb. I consider those pretty serious issues aside from what's happened in the back stories. Could you explain what you mean by serious then?</br></br>  <br>There's probably more detail in the extra chapter stuff but there's info in the sealed document arc. That's all we know until they go to the corporation, after they graduate from university. However much blood and sanity "graduating" costs this time.</br>  <br> Nothing seriously bad has happened to the main cast. </br>  <br> rape is bad unless its women doing it. <br>Feminists will defend this.</br></br>  <br>He's defining as "If they're still alive, then nothing bad has happened to them yet". It's stupid, edgy AgK-tier logic.</br>  <br>Didn't know muh iphone's color inversion function has a way to use.</br>  <br> /a/ separates <br> DAE 4CHAN SO SCARY spergs flock to it <br> /a/ becomes MAL <br>no thanks</br></br></br></br>  <br>This has been going on for way too long, Kurumi needs to turn soon, the manga's credibility is at stake.</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>It's daijoubu.</br>  <br>I was really hoping they would do this the entire series through tunnel vision and we the audience would have to notice the hints, then again its already exposed so is there really a point anymore?</br>  <br>Yeah, no. Fuck you faggot. Kurumi will survive.</br>  <br><br>The delusion is strong here.</br></br>  <br>The reader can sense that invisible line where you know that certain characters just seem like they aren't going to die. Whats important is that when you've got such a grim story like this you keep death scary but just a tad better than what the characters are going though so the reader can empathize.</br>  <br>I'm not sure how you're defining it. The characters obviously have problems, since if there were no problems there would be no story, but none of the central cast have suffered anything permanently debilitating. The only reason the current ones seem especially serious is that unlike all of the other ones in the series, we haven't seen how they're resolved yet.</br>  <br>Those two pages combined spell more like diejoubu to me.</br>  <br>Nah thats dead. Its going to end up being that the "cure" is only a suppressant hence the cold skin and the zombies not noticing you as walking by.</br>  Would you sex Kurumi even if it mean  getting infected?   <br>And yet she still hasn't. Just like every other dark arc, it'll seem doomed until the last minute.</br>  <br> manga's cred <br> making shovel zombie <br>No son, no. You are not writing this story, there is fanfiction.net for people like you.</br></br></br>  not ch 38 today ?  <br> My semen would be the cure. </br>  <br><br>So essentially you're defining serious problem as dead or crippled? That's kind of silly in a series so focused on the characters' psychology.</br></br>  <br>This looks like the only survivor of the club writing her memories.</br>  <br>That's exactly what I mean, the suppressant lasts really long.</br>  <br>Kurumi will not survive, but don't expect her to die anytime soon, she will die near the end of the manga.<br>If anyone, Rii-san is the one that will die in the near future.</br></br>  <br>If it wasn't for Kurumi, she would have died at the University.</br>  <br>Imagine getting a blood transfusion from her. The same way, her wet, warm bodily fluids would cause an infection by coming in contact with your reproductive organ, while she is all sweaty yet her body is all cold, despite her flushed face and heavy breathing.</br>  <br>This is probably the most painful page in the entire manga. That fucking deathflag panel. Even Mii-kun sees it.</br>  <br>Why would you ever think that, anon? Yuki will always be with her friends.</br>  <br> Fucking a zombie <br>No thank you.</br></br>  <br>That would have been a very anti-climatic death.<br>I bet she dies trying to save the stupid bear.</br></br>  How will you react when inevitable scene of someone using Kurumi's shovel to bury her?  <br>I'm usually on the optimistic side, but I'm just not feeling it from this series. I'd take a bittersweet ending over a completely tragic one, but I can't see all of them getting out of this alive and unscathed.</br>  <br>I doubt anyone other than the side characters are going to end up dying. This series loves to make everything dark just to swerve away at the last moment.</br>    <br>I wouldn't be able to hold it in.</br>  <br>What if they bury the shovel with her? Somebody must sacrifice herself to be buried alive with her.</br>  <br> Mii-kun takes up senpai's shovel <br> Becomes the shovel <br> Wanders aimlessly with a death wish to kill zombies and save people <br> Maybe it would bring her closer to senpai <br> Maybe when she's infected she'll understand how Kurumi felt.  ;_;7  </br></br></br></br></br>  How do I become genki like Yuki?  <br>They will bury her with her shovel, then laugh about it later on about how silly that was.</br>  <br>None of them are "unscathed", but after nearly forty chapters of just-barely-averted tragedy and side characters being introduced just to keep the tone by dying, I don't think the story would even know how to kill a main character.</br>  <br> 444 <br>I'm scared. Don't do this to me.</br></br>  <br>And your proof is?<br>I think you haven't read any Nitro+ VN, they always make things like a ticking bomb and love to do a lot of setup before anything truly impactful happens.</br></br>    <br>Lose control of reality.</br>  <br>We all know it's inevitable anon-kun.</br>  They're not gonna kill a main character in the first 10 chapters, guys, come on.<br>We have to get attached so it will hurt more</br>  <br>She gets bitten but they cut off her arm in time.  Then they replace it with the shovel. </br>  <br>Make yourself a Megu-nee tulpa.</br>   some anons actually believe nobody from the main cast will die <br> nitroplus manga </br>  <br>I lost a 0 there, my bad<br>100 chapters, not 10<br><br><br> Tulpa <br>Don't you start this now<br>2spoopy4me</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Keep saying daijboubu.</br>  <br>How can either of us have "proof" of how an in-progress story is going to go? The point is that it's how every single other arc has gone, except that for this one we haven't seen the ending yet.</br>  <br>Upgrade to a chainsaw/</br>  <br>The shovel gets bitten and they don't cut it off.  So she bites off her other arm to replace it with another shovel. </br>  <br>Her other hand.</br>  <br>We must get a drawfag.</br>  <br>She could replace her legs and feet with rakes.</br>  <br>Don't their zombies react to sound? Wouldn't a chainsaw be pretty shit in that regard?</br>  <br>Miki had the gun last and she is rock solid she should've kept it <br><br><br>well I dunno about you but it's crazy how every survivor beside pilot was a young female there's got to be some packs of rapelord males out there somewhere</br></br></br></br>  <br>She has already turned into some freak of nature with a chainsaw arm. She can be a distraction.</br>  <br>They will probably all survive this arc, but not until the end of the manga.<br><br> How can either of us have "proof" of how an in-progress story is going to go? <br>My proof is that the ones doing the manga have never bitched out at making main characters die, so it is safe to assume they will not bitch out this time. Your's is?</br></br></br></br>  Am I the only one who looped the daisuke part in the OP like 20 times?  <br>The perfect killing machine.</br>  <br>Yes. YES.</br>  <br>A chainsaw would be a shit weapon for a zapocalypse regardless, but because this is fiction and it won't be trash<br> weapon that goes through zombies like butter and also attracts them to it <br> not fucking fantastic </br></br></br>  <br>Unless you wanted them to come to you, to kill them all in a final heroic sacrifice to let the other characters escape(with the shovel of course).</br>  <br>Guns never stay with the sane ones in that scenario. Mii-kun and Shovel knew that it would fuck them over.</br>  <br>Does the GENKI DE~SU part counts?</br>  To be fair the girls didn't know that the medicine needed to be maintained and they thought it was a one shot cure, BUT<br>why in the FUCK did they not think to take at least one box from the massive store they had before they left the school? Did it really not occur to any one of them that what happened to Kurumi could as easily happen to them, too? I just don't get why they wouldn't take extra as a back up. Even if they didn't think to use it on themselves, they could have taken some in the hopes of curing other survivors.</br>  <br>Eventually in a zapo, I think you're gonna snap and just kill zeds for the thrill of killing zeds, and in small enough numbers, like a convenience store or something, a chainsaw would rack up that killcount something fierce  in fiction where chainsaws aren't trash </br>  <br>nigga I've just been listening to the full thing on repeat for days now. So cute and comfy</br>  <br>Stop bringing your sense into my littlegirl zombie manga.</br>  <br>It's times like that where you rig two chainsaws up to a pole or an oar then just go Darth Maul on some undead plebs</br>  <br> The point is that it's how every single other arc has gone, except that for this one we haven't seen the ending yet. <br><br>And it's by someone who happens to work at Nitro+, it's not a Nitro+ manga.</br></br></br>  <br>Could've swore they did bring some with them. They have a stash of like, five or six usable syringes full of the shit.</br>  <br>It's weird to put the company's name on it just because somebody got a job there, but the company got no relation to the work.</br>  <br>What makes you think they didn't?</br>   yfw when they go inside the uni and find ugly old fat dudes waiting for them <br> yfw when uni girls said 'you want protection? then give them all of your body pls' </br>  <br> 'you want protection? then here is your condom' </br>  <br>He has used the same formula as Nitro+ in Gakkou, and it is impossible to give this manga a good ending without being an asspull.<br>But believe what you want, just wait and see.</br></br>  <br>Stop self inserting your filthy hetero fantasies into a pure yuri manga.</br>  <br>Why would they want protection again?</br>  chapter 03    <br>choose between those two next pics</br>          <br>I'd say this. Simply because more readable</br>    Why does everyone besides Sakura look better in her manga?  <br>But she looks really good.</br>  <br><br><br>Original</br></br></br>  <br> next </br>  <br>This one. English simply isn't made for top-down reading.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Okay.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If something is wrong, let me know about it, i will fix it asap.</br>    <br> Fail. <br><br/></br></br>                      <br><br>No offense, but I don't like the redraws in this page.<br><br>Do you mind if we use mine's?</br></br></br></br>  Nice job on the typesetting! I wish I had the know-how to do it myself.<br><br>This chapter was much shorter.</br></br>    <br>okay, i will fix it asap.<br><br>dl Link: http://imgur.com/a/wvDZF</br></br></br>  <br>thanks<br><br><br>last page.</br></br></br></br>  <br>if you got the time, can you redraw this part as well before i upload it on batoto ?</br>  <br><br>Alright, I'll see what I can do.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>just the above part (the title)</br>  <br><br>The Fate Stay Nigh thing?</br></br>  <br>I think he wants the #3 and what follows in that line gone.</br>  <br>I don't have to turn my head like an idiot to read this one, so yeah, this.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, that's what I thought. He said "above" and I got confused for a second.</br></br>  <br><br>Only this part</br></br>  <br>And now mew is here. Are you always lurking /a/ or something?</br>  <br>What, that's it?!</br>  <br>He should redraw that whole section. I mean, he's already doing it and it'll look better with all of that translated, so...</br>  <br>the volume 01 has 168 pages.<br>Chapter 0 = 26 pages<br>Chapter 01 = ~60 pages<br>Chapter 02 = ~60 pages<br><br>And i guess they included the chapter 03 = 22 pages</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just forget about what i said, it's all bullshit.<br><br>Volume 01 = 164 pages<br><br>http://www.amazon.co.jp/Fate-stay-n<wbr>ight-Heavens-%E8%A7%92%E5%B7%9D%E3%<wbr>82%B3%E3%83%9F%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3<wbr>%82%B9%E3%83%BB%E3%82%A8%E3%83%BC%E<wbr>3%82%B9-ebook/dp/B00ZZCGQOW/ref=sr_<wbr>1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436744541&amp;<wbr>sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Fate%2Fstay+night</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chapter 0 was so unnecessary. I know Fate is 10 years old, but don't spoil all that shit like it's nothing for fuck's sake.</br>  <br> but don't spoil <br>Most of the people reading it are VN players, it leaves room for extra exposition and more stuff that wasn't shown or fully explained in the VN.<br>Why cater to the lower percentage?<br> inb4 90% vs 10% </br></br></br></br>  <br>When you put it like that, yeah, fuck secondaries.</br>  <br>I thought the manga would get quite a lot of readers who just watched UBW and are waiting for the HF movies</br>   This was one of the opening pages to the first chapter <br> Dark Sakura probably isn't going to appear for half a decade </br>  <br><br>You sure?</br></br>  <br>That's a big head.</br>  <br><br> 4u </br></br>  <br> We won't see Best Sakura for half a decade <br>Why does it hurt so much?</br></br>  <br>Most of the people who watched UBW read the VN already, seriously they have a scroll in every episode promoting the VN, it's even on the Appstore and it was free during UBW's airing. Even if they didn't read the VN they probably watched Zero already.<br>The people you are thinking off are a very, very small minority.</br></br>  <br> Best Sakura <br> not BB </br></br>  <br>Wasn't only Fate free?</br>  <br>as you want, i will upload it tomorrow anyway.</br>  <br>UBW was free during the 2nd cour like how Fate was free during the first, you still have to buy HF though which would tempt most people into buying it.</br>  <br><br>I mean, at this point I could redraw the whole thing.<br><br>But if you want only that, then okay.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Saber does it for free?</br>  <br>let's go with the whole thing, it will look better.</br>  <br>Fuck you, Sakura. You horrible manipulative woman. You can't tell people what to do and not give them a resonable explanation for it. God damn who the fuck decided this bitch should get her own route? Thank goodness it's only going to be one movie.</br>  <br>Task Ohna just wanted to draw Dark Sakura right away. Can't blame him, she does weird things to my dick.</br>  <br>She takes her job very seriously.</br>  <br>What? How? You imagine her using her shadow dress to jack you off or something you damn pervert?</br>  <br>  Thank goodness it's only going to be one movie. <br><br>More than one; it's obvious.</br></br></br>  <br>If Deen can make UBW in 90 minutes, ufo can make HF in 120.<br>Believe in them.</br></br>  <br>Sakurafags on suicide watch. I wish I had a button to shock every single one of them.</br>  Miura's big idea for HF was to make a single six hour movie. He said that it'd be impossible, though.  <br>that's why i think of several movies.</br>  <br>The guy is cat on head retarded.</br>  <br>That's gonna get shaved down into 3.<br> Unless Ufotable just animates the cool scenes and an ending then at the end of the credits there is a huge "READ THE FUCKING VN" plastered on the screen. </br></br>  <br>Or he might just be an insane genius?</br>  <br>Miura is our guy. Don't hate our guy..</br>  <br>I'd watch that.</br>  <br>Why is her telling him to try to avoid getting involved in this magus death fight so he won't die so "FUCK YOU, GO DIE" type bad? Of course she can't tell him that its a magus death fight, since he doesn't really know anything about magus stuff beyond his father telling him a few stories, and it would be revealing more than a few things about herself as well.<br><br>Well maybe she could tell him a bit more, but as said a few seconds ago that would lead into a dozen other conversations like "Yes I'm a magus as well", and if you know her character she wants to just be normal around him since that's her sanctuary.<br><br>So she just asked him to trust her and go with it for now, just stay in for tonight. The amount of time they've been together should be worth at least that much even without much explanation given.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was Kondo (ufo's producer) who had that wild fantasy.</br>  <br>I'd rather the 6 hour movie. Better than waiting fucking forever to see the scenes you want animated.</br>  Only one movie: https://soundcloud.com/karoshi-4/vo<wbr>ice-003-001</wbr>  <br>Has there ever been an anime movie with a runtime that is even close to that?</br>  <br>I think the longest, outside of any potential weird arthouse stuff, is around two and a half hours.</br>  <br>We have went over this already, what is really said and what the TM Ace says about it.</br>  <br>What's the difference besides darker levels?</br>  Does anyone know what this tweet is going on about?  <br>Just look closely at the moon<br><br>Pics from http://bosel.blog64.fc2.com/blog-en<wbr>try-3778.html</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>God Sakura's head looks weird.</br>  Task Ohna's drawing    <br>So pretty</br>  Soon<br> Character popularity poll <br>https://twitter.com/prisma_illya/st<wbr>atus/616582279238791168</wbr></br></br>  <br> Rin &gt; Luvia </br>  <br>5 hour movie confirmed?</br>  <br>Lord of the ring: 4 hours</br>  <br>I was thinking anime specifically.</br>  <br>Anon mentioned Anime movie.</br>  one movie is really not enough, what are they thinking?? the sales were not good? not as good as Zero?<br><br>Gotta' lower my expectations if it is confirmed...</br></br>  <br>I'm guessing it's some new/expanded scenes.</br>  <br>We have nothing fully confirmed yet. They haven't even started production on it. They're too busy working on this masterpiece.</br>  <br>BAZETT FLASHBACK CONFIRMED</br>  <br>That's Takeuchi btw.</br>    <br>And people wonder why they keep sucking Nasu's dick.</br>  Before I go, I leave this here. Just in case.  Thanks for the hard work guys! Hoping next months chapter goes up to Rin and Shirou meeting each other.  <br><br>You are shitting me.</br></br>  <br>nah I haven't browsed 4chan in years. I just followed the link in the BL thread.</br>  <br>Fair enough. The shitposting is too much sometimes, but other than that we can have nice threads and the fanbase here is dedicated.</br>  <br>I am... but wouldn't that be awesome?</br>  <br>Good call, we can be pretty shitty 90% of the time here.</br>  <br>Yeah, this thread is pretty 10%.</br>  <br>If they didn't have Bazett in the main series, I doubt it's something they would hold out for the BDs. Ufo either decided it wasn't relevant enough to UBW or they're saving her for HA.</br>  <br>She was indirectly mentioned in episode 14.</br>  <br> HA <br>How would they even do it? TV series? OVA? How much SOL, how much backstory, how much plot?</br></br>  Google translate synopsis from something in the volume release<br><br> Nasu mushroom teacher also talks about one page plump this Komikaraizu the guest comment. <br> This Komikaraizu planning seems to have apparently moved from two years ago. <br><br>  Tasukuona's "Nasu-san. Although I what an even say such things in the opposite station" <br>  Nasu wrote: "Yes, what'll we currently Bucchigiri first place Kusoya ...... <br>  Nevertheless, your friendly Tasukuona's. <br>  Watakushi, only Tsumo up of the parent because soon jump unlikely but please forgive me. " <br>  Tasukuona's "do not do such outrageous conduct. I'm a serious story, <br>  Hayate decades from playing Fate. <br>  ... In fact from the time that, I wanted to try to cartoon of cherry root. <br>  Experience in this three years I was loading. There is also a strength for the simultaneous series. <br>  First or Ron would not get to hear just talk, <br>  The Doraron, fly in the parent twice and Kinoko~o! " <br>  Nasu-san "to the people and not the attitude that ask things, Satewa serious's Na Teme~e!?" <br><br>  Eyes and point it is this thing. After it is generally true story. <br><br> Nasu-san and Tasukuona who is revealed the inside story of the impact is the fact that Mahjong fellow. <br> Komikaraizu cherry route did not go up also in the planning because difficult than the other two routes. <br> Dare had appeared to be going psyched from their to there is not that Tasukuona's. <br> I heard also enthusiasm to sell from their own, I think love is what is also substantial to work. <br> Even so, Na's this two people fun w </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well that's completely incomprehensible.</br>  <br>Something about Mahjong</br>  <br>Still a far cry from showing her in the flesh.<br><br>OVAs makes the most sense, given the nature of the Majora's Mask-esque progression. A series of vignettes with about 1/4 of them being the main story sounds balanced.</br></br></br>  <br>Please Takeuchi, no more ahoges. Just get Sakura's curves right and we'll be fine.</br>  <br>That's not an ahoge, that's just a strand of hair.</br>  <br> cartoon of cherry root </br>    <br>The common joke to say right now is that rather than being gay, that's masturbation. Truthfully though, it's just gay.<br><br>Shirou and Archer have the same starting points, but their end points will be different. They're two distinct individuals, and if one plows the other's man hole, then that's one separate being fucking another.</br></br></br>  <br>C'mon anon<br><br>What could possibly be gay about two men getting intimate in a sexual nature? What could possibly be homosex about two men getting together and having some man on man time? <br><br>You're out of it, nothing about that sounds gay at all, its one of the most hetero activities you might find.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Shirou is no longer alone. Archer is waiting for him in the future. <br><br>Gay</br></br></br>  <br>Scans from Newtype are out? Got anymore?</br>  <br>Saber isn't relevant in UBW either but they still inserted a bunch of half-assed flashbacks in episode 21.</br>  <br>Saber is a semi-relevant side character in UBW. She roughly gets the same character arc as she did in the Fate route, it's just not front and center.</br>  <br> Heaven Feel's PV is 4 shots of Sakura turning around </br>  <br>That's all they animated. That shit ain't coming for years.</br>  <br> and if you know her character she wants to just be normal around him since that's her sanctuary. <br><br>And that makes her a selfish manipulative bitch. If you care for someone you fucking tell them what's up. No excues. Sakura has nothing but execuses and she's a pain to deal with. Just tell him you can do magic, Don't let him nearly suicide himself every night when you know it's a bad method you fucking bitch! And Sakurafags clam that she loves him?</br></br></br>  Thank you for all your time, effort and interest, HF manga team!  <br> Prin- <br> touts <br><br>It should be print-outs, anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>No Fate/hollow ataraxia content, I think.</br>  <br><br>&lt;3</br></br>  <br>...but in the end, it doesn't even matter.</br>  <br>You're kind of pushing this in her own direction entirely, and then going an extra ten feet with it.<br><br>A friend even if they don't explain everything that's up, just them asking you to do something for them is usually enough. You just go "You're my bro, so I'll listen seriously since you seem serious'. You can't always explain it to them right now, you listen to them if they're serious, and if you need to know what it was about after then they will tell you.<br><br>If she thought his life was seriously in danger with the grail war she would have done something more, but at this point it was still just a bad feeling for her.<br><br>She doesn't know magic any more than him to correct him about the proper way to do it. She was never trained at all, she was just abused. The most she could say is "Fucking stop, that's dangerous", but she can't show him anything correct. He wouldn't stop because "I just need to do this, if it can help anyone then I must" train, rather than him finding it fun or anything. He already knew exactly what he was doing anyway, there was no mistake so much. She's afraid that he would think differently of her if she showed her hand, she tried to solve it in an indirect manner without risking everything by just asking him to trust her and don't go out for the next day until she gets back.<br><br>If her hunch was nothing then it would be no big deal, and she would be back the next day to watch over him again. She's not really manipulating here, she's just afraid and it feels like her world is kind of breaking down since she thought she left this grail war bullshit behind giving her servant to Shinji, so she could go back to her normal life, only to find out it was uprooted anyway since Shirou was maybe chosen as well.<br><br>It's like "Was that all for nothing?". A passive feeling where you fool yourself that nothing will change here, but maybe its already too late.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best girl makes an appearance.</br>  <br>RIN A BEST!</br>  <br>Do you have a version with the text, based Heart?</br>  <br><br>With or without?</br></br>  <br>Without the text, please. It's great artwork.</br>  <br><br>This is the closest I have.<br><br>I could redraw the Fate Stay Night logo and maybe promotional art, but it would take me a while.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's fine, thank you.</br>  <br>She's been with Shirou for a fucking year and thinks he'd listen to a request like that? She just wants to lock him away in her nice little happy place regardless of Shirou's feelings on the matter and that's selfish,anon. Sakura's love is a selfish love just like Saber's love is a ridiculously unrealistic one where she has to basically degrade herself mind,body and soul just so that Shirou can take the lead. It really shows that Nasu did not set out originally to make her or Sakura Shirou's lovers and that they were shoe horned in like that because eroge.</br>  <br> She was never trained at all, she was just abused. <br>This is pure bullshit. He thought her magic.</br></br>  <br><br>Small filter and leveled.</br></br>  <br>You're really great at this, Heart. What's your secret?</br>  <br><br>Hard-work and patience.<br><br>The truth? I do it with utmost care. Every small detail is important to me, I look at every that needs to be done and I do it over and over again until I'm happy with the outcome. And then, when I hand the product over, I see another small detail that went unnoticed and tell myself I'll do it better next time.<br><br>I enjoy what I do, I suppose that's the secret.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have any projects you're working on or are you a free lancer?</br>  Great work! It was a great read can't wait for the next chapter.  <br><br>Started doing redraws with this very manga, you tell me.<br><br>The only reason I'm working on this is because HF is my favorite route.</br></br></br></br>  <br>domo</br>  <br> those expecting puppy eyes <br>too cute</br></br>  <br><br>Excellent. Another round of Count the Senpais. I'll go get the booze and see how long I last this episode.</br></br>  <br>Don't die.</br>  <br><br>There's only been 40 Senpais in the Manga so far. That's not enough to kill me. Now the movies, that's probably going to put me in Hospital. If I do die, I've left instructions for someone to notify /a/ and give my Obituary. 'It was worth it for best girl'.</br></br>  <br><br>And that was Six. So 46 Senpais in the HF Manga so far.<br><br>My eternal quest to destroy my liver continues...</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Are you people actually autist?</br></br></br></br>  What is our first fight scene? Saber vs Lancer, right?  <br>What's she thingken about?</br>  <br>Where do you think we are?</br>  <br>Smug-chan!</br>  Wait, did Shirou dream about Caliburn in HF?  <br>He gets visions of things from archer's arm.</br>  <br><br>They're really good</br></br>  <br>But he hasn't gotten Archer's arm yet.</br>  <br>Fixed.</br>  <br><br>She's a slut who pleases old men for money and young woman for the gay times.</br></br>  <br>Rin is pure.</br>  <br><br> Pure <br> Has an H-Scene in every route, including one where she fucks a girl and them masturbates to watching the other two fuck. <br><br>Pure my arse.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>1. The H scene in HF is actually Rider<br>2. The scene in Fate was just her graciously helping Shirou and Saber figure out that the ponis goes in the vagoo.</br></br>  <br> 1. The H scene in HF is actually Rider <br>Its actually pretty vague. Although it fits in with Rider's character's abilities, Rin can also use those spells, and Caster too.<br><br>Here's a question. Why would Rider impersonate Rin out of all the women? Couldn't she just do a lewd Sakura instead?<br>Its because Rider knew that only Rin was naughty enough to do that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirou has been wanting the dolphin from Rin for ages. It's only in HF where he learns to take Sakura's worm.</br>  <br><br>Or maybe it's because Rider has a bit of a thing for Rin.</br></br>  <br> Rider thinks of Rin when thinking of naughty things. <br>Anon, that's lewd.<br><br>Now I can only imagine Rider thinking of Rin like Castah does when Saber is concerned, getting excited when confronting each other.</br></br></br></br>  Maybe Rider just wanted to be Rin for a bit, because everyone wants to be best girl.  <br>So even Rider thinks Rin is the best girl? I don't know what to think of this, as I've decided to bet on Sakura instead.</br>  <br><br>Those two both dance around the fact they want to fuck each other like it's nobody's business.<br><br>If I recall, it's implied in one of the HF endings they are sleeping together.<br><br><br><br>If by best girl you mean 'girl I want to sleep with', then sure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dayum, these details. I'm really happy we got a good artist taking care of HF, can't wait for the good scenes.<br>He better give us ton of Riderservice.</br></br>  <br>  Young Taiga <br><br>B<br>A<br>S<br>E<br>D<br><br>I wonder if they'll add more content. Like references to Zero and Gil fighting inside the shadow before getting rekt.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She got just one H scene in her own route, less than Saber and and the purple one.</br>  <br> Rin can also use those spells, and Caster too. <br>She appeared with Rider's eyes at the end of that scene for fuck's sake, how is that vague?</br></br>  <br>Maybe Rin had an eye infection.</br>  <br> Rider's eyes. <br>There's more than one character in F S/N that share the same eye color.<br><br>You could even say that its actually Sakura, after using her shadow powers and taking the form of Rin.</br></br></br></br>  <br> There's more than one character in F S/N that share the same eye color. <br>Does Sakura have square irises?<br>Fuck off, retard.</br></br></br>  <br> Moving the goalposts <br>First you say color, and then square irises.<br>Holy shit can you make yourself more mad intentionally?<br> Square irises <br>How conclusive, not.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> le troll u mad XD <br>niceme.me</br></br>  Why Night of Fate when the studio itself uses Fateful Night?  <br>Get out. You're just shitting the thread. Why not actually read/play heaven's feel?<br>Its not as if Rider needed Shirou's mana at that point.</br></br>  <br> Why not actually read/play heaven's feel? <br>The irony.<br>Apply it to yourself, faggot.</br></br></br>  <br> Because you say her eyes are square? <br>Give me a break anon. And coincidentally, just because you're on track in Sakura's route, Rider automatically sexes Shirou for no reason?<br>That doesn't even make sense. It makes as much sense as the girl taking the form of Rin, just because.</br></br></br>  <br> Rider automatically sexes Shirou for no reason? <br>How many more times do I have to call you a retard until you get up your ass and read the shit?</br></br>  <br>Uwawawa. Fuck off.<br>Now you're implying it wasn't Rider after saying it was. You're so full of shit anon. I mean you're just shitposting now for the hell of it.</br></br>  <br>  If you care for someone you fucking tell them what's up <br><br>yeah, tell him that they're having a secret battle to death with heroes of ancient times and mages, that will probably make him safe.</br></br></br>  <br><br>fuck off, both of you</br></br>  <br>I want to hug this creature</br>  <br><br>No, he didn't, he shot magic into her with harmful parasites so her body could be used like a living wand. That usually fucks people up, Ala Archer's arm, but she had potential great enough she didn't become a comatose wreck. You see, Zouken doing what he did would normally just outright either kill people or make them like Kariya. It's not teaching people, it's subjugation them into slaves that can only use magic.<br><br>Also Sakura didn't tell Shirou about the grail because she needs to confirm things. She didn't participate herself because she knows Zouken will use her as a sacrificial piece, her body can't take handling a servant in combat with the worms continually draining her energy, and she knows Zouken ain't stupid enough to take the worms out when she has a powerful servant, even if that would up her chances to win. Taking off the bomb collar when your slave has a gun is stupid.<br><br>The next chapter is her talking to Zouken about the war.<br><br>But we already know she burns the book when Shinji breaks his promise not to hurt Shirou. He promised her he would only use Rider to protect himself.<br><br>See, she did try to do things to help, but saying she is in a rock and a hard place is putting it extremely mildly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm down with that, based ufo.</br>  <br>based heart.</br>  <br>Why not six one hour movies?</br>  <br>Now this looks really fucking good.</br>  <br> Like references to Zero <br>Please fucking don't. If something, we don't need more Zero secondaries pandering.</br></br>  <br>There's an entire scene dedicated to it. Fuck off.</br>  <br><br>But that would be one super movie, do you realize how much fun it would be to go out on a weekend and sit through six hours of film? I'd be like going to an event that show a trilogy of films consecutively, but condensed into one film.<br><br>The problem with that though is theaters could probably only have 2-3 screenings a day. Turnout foe a 6 hour movie n weekdays would probably very low, less people could see it (theater capacity per screening), and when it comes time to sell DVD and Blu-Rays one extremely expensive movie would be odd. Although the last one might not be a problem because Aniplex already sex box sets so this wouldn't be much different.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Its also highly unlikely that viewers wont get hungry and they will end up having to go outside and buy overpriced theatre food, especially if they didn't know the length of the film beforehand.</br>  <br>Shirou is pretty suicidal about these things<br><br>Telling him would be the one way to for sure get him involved.</br></br></br>  <br>Also noted that she would have stopped Shinji if she had known what he was planning to do at the school, which is why Rider did it behind her back.<br><br> &gt;Rider invoked Blood Fort Andromeda despite Sakura being in the school. If the barrier was sustained, would Rider have went to save Sakura even if it meant disobeying Wakame [Seaweed, Shinji's nickname]? &lt;Teacher Blossom&gt; <br><br> Takeuchi: I'm actually wondering about that too. <br><br> Nasu: I hate to be mean, but Sakura has enough magical energy such that she would only be in a coma. To Rider that's not a problem, which is why it was done in secret from Sakura. Had she talked to Sakura instead, it would have become much more chaotic like "stop her brother → her brother becomes more of a Wakame." <br><br>Its good when people remember she isn't a monster on occasion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>people still gobble up type-meme shit when it old and they havent produced anything new in years,yet your retards seem to enjoy the same shit over and over</br>  they made a manga because there is only one movie which is going to be only 1 hour long?<br><br>Also, what is the meaning of the "Last episode" in the last preview? (pic related)</br></br>  <br>It means this is it, Fate's all over now, for good.<br>And yet, when Best Girl will finally be the main character, its all over. Life isn't fair sometimes.</br></br>  <br>Your father is working at ufotable?</br>  <br>Better than Meme Eater, at least.</br>  <br> the person who thinks last episode is going to be adapted <br> in-charge of decuction </br></br>  <br> they made a manga because there is only one movie which is going to be only 1 hour long? <br><br>Right, that's why they made a Fate Zero manga as well, and an adaption of almost every other Fate story to date. UBW got a comedy side manga, but it also got a manga.<br><br>Its almost like getting a manga is unrelated to the length of the series as a way to predict it. Fate/Zero manga is even still going now. Fate/Extra's manga just ended recently after like five or six years, so they can finally do CCC manga.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>But anon, she is a cold blooded serial killer who cares little about others and just wants happy fun time with senpai. Surely she hates all those disgusting humans who never helped her and would be glad that the Bloodfort took care of some of them.<br><br>/sarcasm<br><br>I would hope this excerpt from Nasu would put some of that shit to rest, but we both know that ain't gonna happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I always thought it was a Tsukihime Len situation in that it's up to the character who they imagine. Which is why Sakura asks who his dream was about and get's upset if it's Rin and happy if it's her.</br></br>  <br>It'd have to be three 2-hour movies. It's the only way to do it properly, and it's perfectly feasible.</br>  <br>This. Everybody is going trilogy nowadays, why not Heaven's Feel?</br>  <br>40 dollars for 3 small buckets of movie popcorn</br>  <br>It sounds like a marvelous idea.<br><br><br>Moreover, there would probably be lots of people needing to take a piss.</br></br></br></br>  Sakura is the only heroine that didn't give up her virginity for a guy she knew for two weeks. Pure as hell.  <br> saber <br> virginity </br></br>  <br><br>Rin knew Shirou longer than 2 weeks. She knew him well enough to squander her most prized gem to save his life.</br></br>  <br>They knew of each other. That hardly counts as knowing each other.</br>  <br><br>Let's not pretend that Sakura knew him better before she fell in love with him. They both got wet watching him jumping like a retard on the track field.</br></br>  <br>Rin had sex with shirou to save the world.</br>  <br><br>wrong reading direction. if text is tilted your read from the bottom to the top</br></br>  <br>Yes but, is she started having sex with him a week and a half after she started to come to his house to treat his injuries. I don't think seeing him do the high jump two years earlier would qualify ask her knowing him.</br>  <br>Counter Force would have saved the world anyway<br><br>Literally nothing Shirou did to save the world ever mattered, the answer was already guaranteed from the start. Alaya or Gaia will protect itself.<br><br>Either it will cause some series of events to unfold to save it, or it will summon guardians. Its such a thing to realize that if you're devoting yourself to saving everything, you're wasting your time. The most you can do is save the small things, since Alaya is willing to have some sacrifices to save the many, and really doesn't care about the few. Which is synonymous for all heroes in this series basically; you're treated as hero when you kill the few and save the many in any path, even Gilgamesh does that much, and to go against that to save the few is the atypical dream.<br><br>There's nothing out there that really cares about the few that fall between the cracks. It's like something I'm realizing here, but that's always the system in place with these people.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not caring about the 1% </br>  <br>The world did not need saving. The mud was a filter and it would have killed almost everyone but humans would have still lived which is all Alaya cares about.</br>  <br>UBW types are always saying Shirou is willing to sacrifice if he needs to or has to, wants to. He won't break from it anymore, he understands there are options and its impossible to live up to his ideal, even if he will still try to live up to it when he can, he'll make the choice when he needs, and he'll kill out the few over the many each time but in a slightly different way from Kerry.<br><br>I always preferred the interpretation of Shirou that he basically couldn't make that choice that kills either, like Batman. Like Batman is already pretty Shirou as fuck. Batman if he had to kill the many or the few, he would choose neither, both options are impossible for him, he'll always try to save both because he's fucked on the inside and someone dying for him is wrong. There is no outcome with sacrifice, he'll always try to push forward.<br><br>They keep telling me in threads lately its not even a choice for Shirou if he's in a corner, its surely the many that will live in Fate or UBW.<br><br>I don't know about that.<br><br><br>Alaya would have stopped it way before most humans would have died. Alaya doesn't save the world in the first place, it protects humanity, as in the majority. Alaya all the time protects humans against humanity or any disaster. Even if it was a disaster that encompassed humanities hatred, that's also something Alaya regularly protects against.<br><br>This isn't anything too strange for it, the only rule is that Alaya can only act "after" its started. Nasu says that HF might have reached the point when the counter force intervened as well, but it hadn't quite reached that point yet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sakura got to know him after the high jump though, and became part of his second family. I doubt people think Sakura knew of him before then. Rin had the crush, but didn't pursue it until the war started, or even got to know him beyond passing each other in the hallway, and spying in him having Sakura come over to his house as part of her stalking ritual.<br><br>Her using the jewel was part her being a decent person (since yeah, she did allow a deadly war in the middle of her land full of innocent civies to happen), part of it was her admiration for Shirou and feelings, and part of it was for Sakura.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes but this is humanities sins.</br>  <br>Rin only used her jewel when she found out it was Shirou.</br>  <br>Which is something Alaya protects against<br><br>Alaya saves humans from humans, any anything else that wants to kill them. It doesn't care, all it cares about is saving the majority.</br></br></br>  <br>It is why they leave the ending open in UBW because he still doesn't know what to do in that situation and he's looking for the answer.</br>  <br> I always preferred the interpretation of Shirou that he basically couldn't make that choice that kills either, like Batman. Like Batman is already pretty Shirou as fuck. Batman if he had to kill the many or the few, he would choose neither, both options are impossible for him, he'll always try to save both because he's fucked on the inside and someone dying for him is wrong. There is no outcome with sacrifice, he'll always try to push forward. <br>You know this actually fits. Shirou's main ideal is protecting everyone, it was only Archer who succumbed to it.</br></br>  <br>Shirou will still kill someone he deems a villain or kill in self-defense if necessary.</br>  <br>HF exists in the story for a reason<br><br>To show that there will be situations where Shirou is out of options, situations that will surely break him, they'll always come along down the line and force him to make a choice when neither choice is good.<br><br>The friction between reality and the ideal<br><br>No matter what Shirou pursues, an ideal can only exist as an ideal, those type of situations will always fuck you over down the road. How much it breaks you is the question, but if he tries to be a hero with this ideal, he'll always succumb eventually and grow a bit numb<br><br><br>Shirou has an entire monologue in Fate route about what his ideal means. He wants to save "Everyone". He uses a bank robbery as an analogy for this. He doesn't just want the hostages to live, but also the police and the bank robber himself. All people there must live, for it to be considered a sucess, or else he's just a half ass.<br><br>Shirou killing the villain is him not living up to his ideal. To be Shirou he should try to save everyone, including the villains. Not just those with a good will, but rather everyone.<br><br>He's a guy with a lot of contradictions and hypocrisies at times though, so even if this is his ideal he still does other things at times.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He also pretty much tossed his ideal in the trashcan in Fate, never cared to try and save Gilgamesh, and killed Kirei. He only regained his ideal by proxy of Saber liking it too.</br>  <br><br>Why is Shirou so B a s e d</br></br>      Why bother doing anything if Alaya will just get a janitor on the job?  <br>Because sometimes you're the janitor</br>  <br> it's okay to be useless because I think everything is useless <br>Kill urself shiki</br></br>    Keeping this thread alive in favor of it at least not being the other thread up.  <br>Ruggy Shiki</br>  <br>This one</br>  <br>It's just Taiga, there's nothing to get excited about.</br>  <br> it's only taiga <br>The titile to the story of her love life</br></br>  <br>I want to save her from her lonely life.</br>  <br>Why would you do something like that?</br>  <br>he felt the worms?</br>  <br>Because I love her.</br>  <br>you would lose anyway</br>   that scene in HA where Shirou's advances went completely over Taigas head <br>Nasu really dislikes /ss/ doesn't he</br>  <br>then what's the truth anon? ease my pain</br>  <br>Shirou, in UBW, is willing to kill multiple times, and he doesn't seem to find it not living up to his ideal. He outright threatens to kill Archer, and was perfectly okay with killing Gilgamesh.<br><br>Shirou reaches a solidified answer in UBW. He wants to save everyone, but he knows that realistically, he can't. There will always be sacrifices. He will try to save everyone though, and he will always try to seek a future where no one dies. Essentially it's a moral of, "do your best, but sometimes you get pushed into a corner".<br><br>Really, some folks seem to forget that there's an entire day after the Archer fight where Shirou's entire character is put to the test, and it's there where he gets his final answer.<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/F_5Q0QDaH5w?t=50s  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gilgamesh and Archer are servants.</br>  <br>Even if you don't think they "count" or whatever, it doesn't matter. Shirou's ideal goes beyond just servants. He will try to save everyone, but he know that realistically it sometimes won't be possible.<br><br>He literally faces the potential future where he ends up killing people in mass, and doesn't break from it. The memories of it, the experiences of it, they all get downloaded into him, and his response after seeing it is, "alright, I'm willing to accept that possibility". He'll try and avoid it, but he knows it may happen.<br><br>The interpretation that Shirou literally starts to break down at the thought of killing others is an okay head canon, but it directly goes against what happens in the story.</br></br></br></br></br>  I'll just leave this here...  <br>Could have figured out a way to bump the thread without memes.</br>  <br>Exceptionally done sir, you sure proved your point to all those uncivilized UBWfags.</br>  <br>Doesn't change the fact that this pic is true though.</br>  <br>Heaven's feel fans are truly the people we need</br>  <br>I tip my fedora towards you, fellow HF entheusiast.</br>  <br>The only thing thats true is how Fedorable you are.<br><br>HFfags and their inferiority complex are the salty gift that keeps on going</br></br></br>  I just finished season 1 last night, going to start season 2 tonight, I have to say I really enjoyed it!<br><br>It kind of had similar themes as monogatari in terms of sound, visuals, and production value, but had much much more 'fun' things and conversations going on all of the time and that made it feel a lot more "magical" than "gloomy" (a la monogatari).<br><br>Anyone else wanna talk about nisekoi?<br><br>Onodera is being suffering I mean damn, I really wanted her to win. I havent seen s2 yet, but I think I've seen enough shows to think that chitoge is probably going to win in the end.<br><br>Why is the tsun always beating out the sweet childhood and/or dere now a days?<br><br>When did this trend start?<br><br>Didn't it use to be different?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why would you make a thread about Nisekoi with a Kiniro Mosaic image?

I would fuck her until she's catatonic.  <br> water <br><br>Shit, I meant matter.</br></br></br>  <br>I agree, but there's no way a loli is going to win the Raku bowl, plus, Komi is too much of a dick to make any developments between Ayaya and Yoko.</br>  <br>you're a man of taste Karen best Nisekoi</br>  <br>Why is Shit-oge so shit?

Nisekoi is so bad the worst is the best.<br><br>Eventually, when everyone gets tired of Nisekoi's shit and stops reading, the author will pair Raku with  dying in a car crash </br></br></br>  <br>Do you have any good reason to distrust what Ayayaya says?</br>   stealth kinmosa thread? being pruned? <br>anyway i've had my share of sol, but i guess sadly it bored me<br>of both series, only the actual gorilla is a shit</br></br>  Look at this precious face.

Which Dragon is your favorite and why?  <br>The one who fucked up Izzard</br>      <br><br>Last I saw was that Baka Tsuki had done 4 parts of chapter 1, but the edit information says July 7 and there hasn't been any progress since then.</br></br>  <br>Is that a dick?</br>  Hopefully really soon so that I can get HO and Zashiki Warashi faster.  <br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127807<wbr>352/#127823926_58</wbr></br>  <br>This. I don't care what that faggot Touma do, I want my Yukari dammit</br>  <br>I want Heavy Object first since Zashiki is boring as fuck especially when detective parts starts.</br>  I finished Index II and I'm going to watch the movie later today, but what was up with the ending? For the last two episodes they started a semi-new storyline with Accelerator and GROUP, which was arguably more interesting than literally anything from both seasons of Index and on par with Railgun, but then it just ends. <br>S3 when?</br>  <br>Because HO isn't boring right?</br>  <br><br>If S3 happens you will have an arc early on that focuses on GROUP and the conflicts with similar groups in a big battle royale.</br></br>  <br>2016. Read volume 15 and 19 of the LN if you just wanna carry on with that accel storyline.</br>   s3 happens <br> it is a 4 cour adapting everything from terra of the left up to agitate halation <br> othinus arc is adapted into two movies </br></br>  <br>Fuck you, Hayabusa's part was awesome. It's Mai that's boring</br>  <br> S3 <br> happens <br>Heh keep.praying</br></br></br>  <br> s3 happens <br> It is a 2 cour adapting everything <br> othinus arc is 4 episodes </br></br></br>  <br>Index anime should end after WW3 then the anime would have stopped before everything went to shit.</br>  <br>That should be 8</br>  <br><br>Im sure we can all agree that Zashiki Warashi needs more Zashiki Warashi.</br></br>  <br>does Touma have an arc nemesis yet? i dropped this series after nt2.</br>  <br>He gets the Anti Touma at the end of NT13.</br>  <br>1 week</br>  <br>He's probably just some scrub who'll get taken out in a single volume so wouldn't say anything yet.</br>    <br> implying a good ending like this will happen </br>  <br><br>If anything, Touma should be thought of as the fucking savior of the universe, since that's what he literally is. Literally no respect.</br></br>  <br> Touma dying <br> implying that he will not suffer forever </br></br>  <br>I love hte angel one.</br>  <br>I dropped this somewhere at NT2 because of shit load of new characters and forgotten old characters. <br>Is he still adding new characters? <br>Who the fuck are those old man and a girl with hanafuda on a hat?</br></br></br>  <br> Touma should be thought of as the fucking savior of the universe, since that's what he literally is. Literally no respect. <br><br> kills 6 billion people because he wants to go back home <br><br>Yeah he's true hero alright.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It keeps getting worse so don't even bother picking this shit back up.</br>  <br>I meant ofuda</br>  <br>Touma wishes that he'd die, but he can't.</br>  <br>killing 6 billion fake people is okay</br>    <br>Yeah, too many characters. That old man was High Priest, a magic god, that girl was Niang Niang, also a magic god</br>  <br> "magic gods after my dick again huh" <br> "my butt hurts" <br> "please kill me" </br></br></br>  <br>I really like Touma's sweater. It's surprisingly stylish and durable for clothing found in a dumpster.</br>  <br>At least he didn't blow up every iteration of his home planet in every timeline because it was in a recursive loop and then store the data in his head leading to a consequent amnesia and then meet the last surviving member of his species who accuses him of genocide and then locks him in the basement and then consequently has the guy die on him leaving him forever alone only to restore his planet and blow it up a second time leaving him alone again because he again found a second member of his species only to find out that &gt;muh angst was entirely misplaced and the planet is actually in a painting after multiple other genocides. <br><br>Touman did literally nothing wrong compared to other main characters. He is still a hero.</br></br></br>  <br> touma <br> getting a peaceful end <br> not being hated and spat upon all across history while perma banished and trapped under a rock. </br></br></br>  <br>This. She's too fucking capable. It's boring to read.</br>  <br>And that's why in her chapter in volume 4 when Sunekosuri took the lead was awesome. He's like non-faggot version of Touma</br>  Do you think there was a world where Othinus tried to break Touma using post-orgasm torture?<br> she slowly teased his dick for hours with her fingertip to make it super sensitive <br> the second after he has finally come she violently took him inside her and brutally rode him while he was crying and begging her to stop </br></br>  <br>muh dik<br>also i doubt that.</br></br>  Railgun 78 raws: https://www.mediafire.com/?13f1672r<wbr>1ha84wa</wbr>  <br>Nice Hamazura cameo</br>  <br>Honestly after DRRR I can see Index 3 being split 3 cour and adapting the rest of Index.</br>  <br>No he needs to at least read the Othinus arc solely for NT9</br>  <br>Othinus x Touma forever, but sorry, her powers are a massive pile of asspull to the nth degree.</br>  <br> implying <br>othinus is literally female odin, shes allowed to do that anon, actual norse mythology is far more retarded in that regard.</br></br>  <br> 2016 <br>Given that Railgun S out just about 2 years after Index II along with the Index Movie, I'd wager that if JC Staff should want to continue adapting shit, we'd get an announcement this year for either winter/spring 2016, or if we're lucky Fall 2015.</br></br>  <br>Fall 2015 is not happening at all. You get HO and that's it. I'm willing to bet Index won't even happen for most of 2016 either. You only have one shot and that's Fall 2016.</br>  <br>couldn´t she literally just drink Mead of poetry<br>to get her power back?by the way were are her<br> ravens?</br></br></br>  <br>Othinus isn't really important in NT9, it's all about Touma confronting himself, his goals and his reasons to fight.<br>Magic God powers were just a plot device to make that happen. Without them there would be no way to pull off the perfect world that is not just an illusion.</br></br>  <br>I've been thinking this as well. How well is DRRR! selling, comparatively? Perhaps they're trialling the format with that before doing it with other properties.</br>  <br>For that to happen, wouldn't she have to admit that she herself suffered the same thing?<br><br>The narrative implies that she subjected him to experiences similar to her own.</br></br></br>  <br>your right anon, it doesn't help the fact theres a pretty good chance othinus has been faking the whole having no powers bullshit.<br>even if she just had the idol theory crap from the crossover she could very well get her powers back that way.<br>finally i'm fairly convinced huginn and muninn are fucking around somewhere in an alternate phase, probably gonna show up sometime soon.</br></br></br>  <br> theres a pretty good chance othinus has been faking the whole having no powers bullshit <br>Now THAT's a good plot twist.</br></br>  <br>the thing is NT 12 pretty much hints about it, 1% of infinite is still infinite after all.</br>  <br><br>also why is anti touma comig after her if she supposedly lose her powers?<br><br>She is suspicious</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> anti-touma is coming <br> Othinus has intel that she will (eventually be defeated) but she knows that Touma could combat this threat <br> lay low <br>Well that's one hell of an interesting theory.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that would get through OT at most.<br>i doubt that would reach the othinus arc.</br></br>  <br>Maybe in some previous world Touma got his arm cut off and Othinus was violated by yet unseen Dildo Dragon.</br>  <br>if you tack on the fact that she legitimately cares about touma a fair bit more then everybody else and seems secure with him after the whole mess of him fighting the entire world for her, it seems like a solid theory at least.</br>  <br>I assume by rest of Index he means rest of OT. I doubt we'll get more than 1 more season, maybe another season and a movie at most. Unless they decide to treat NT as a separate project or something.</br>  <br>It also seems like a fairly solid plot allowing for further development of her character. <br><br>I kinda expected Mikoto to get development after the whole Accel dev arc, but I think that maybe Kamachi isn't done with Othinus yet if the spoilers are right.</br></br></br>  <br>that's the preview released online before the book was on sale</br>  <br>ther is always a question that bothered me. In Nt10 Maria uses deinslef to summon Vishnu from his phase.Othinius is Odin so what would happen if <br>Maria would use Asgard to summon Odin? Are in the Toaru verse 2 odins?</br></br>  <br>There really were no panties, just like Haimura said.</br>  <br> 6 billion people <br> people <br>your imaginary friends don't count as people, anon</br></br></br>  <br>that is based off the assumption that othinus originally came from the phase the series is based on.<br>othinus clearly isn't and thats why it would probably work,<br>since essentially theres alt universe odin which is othinus and the odin of the toaruverse.<br><br>now the interesting thing is othinus could very well try taking the power of the odin of the phase she is currently in, i don't see why she couldn't.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Touma isn't able to recognise accels voice  <br><br>Still find this shit retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>They didn't speak for that long and Accel was squealing through most of it.</br>  <br>Voices generally sounds different when they come through a phone</br>  <br><br>The thing is that the perfect world created by Othinus wasn't any more or less real than Touma's world. Of course state of a perfect happiness wouldn't last to long due to humanity's ability to fuck things up, however people saved by Othinus weren't just illusions. By returning to his own world, Touma reverted all changes Othinus made, so for example Sisters that were well and alive in the perfect world returned to being dead again in Touma's world. If he didn't take any action, they would stay alive. That was the entire reason of his breakdown.<br>He didn't actually kill 6 billion people like anon said, but he destroyed a possibility of thousands of people being saved.</br></br></br>  <br>well even in the cross over she is powerful enough to brute force IB back.</br>  Is there a pasta describing how magic works, or is Index all about "It's magic, I ain't gonna explain shit"?  <br>Read Birdway's explanation in NT 2.</br>  <br>Read NT2, it explains how magic works in Toaruverse dubbed Idol Theory</br>  <br>NT2 is the go to know how on how to into magic</br>  <br><br><br>Well then, call me a faggot but I'll read that when it comes out in 55 years.<br>How does it compare to the nasuverse's magic?</br></br></br></br>  <br>http://toarumajutsunoindex.wikia.co<wbr>m/wiki/Idol_Theory<br>See for yourself.</br></wbr></br>  <br>Dude the volume was fan-translated and the best you can read before Yen Press reach that point.

I had to stop at 3 because shit was just out of control.<br><br>To think, even now Touma is still not getting any.</br></br></br>  <br> not getting any <br>Not getting any what? Girl? He had too much</br></br>  <br><br>But did you see how much of a faggot  is?</br></br>  <br>He's a terrible mc.</br>  <br>He's actively going out of his way to avoid getting any at this point. He could have Mikoto or Kanzaki any time he wants, so I can only assume he's some kind of faggot.</br>  <br> ITEM fanservice <br>BASED</br></br>  New accel chapter fuking when?  <br>End of the month, same as usual?</br>   He held up his right hand, the sole area his reflection was activated on. <br> The water spear was smashed to pieces. <br> The water turned to a rainbow of light that flowed diagonally back from &gt;his right hand <br>and this happened in SS2<br> The mysterious guts guy naming himself Sogiita spread his arms wide, bent his back like <br> a bow, and announced this to the heavens. Haratani didn’t know how it worked, but an <br> explosion of colorful red, blue, and yellow smoke appeared behind him. <br>coincidence i think not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Where are these pictures from?</br></br></br>  <br>Nice phone Touma's got there.</br>  <br>Fuyukawa and Kamachi must have finally remembered that Railgun fans feed off hype and pandering.</br>  <br>It's LO's. Touma keeps 'fukou da'ing his.</br>  <br>Has it repaired from vol 14? Or did he change his phone?</br>  <br>I think his power is the Manipulation of phasen.<br>when he use his Power this happened<br> it seemed like something was wavering like a mirage. <br>the same thing is with his AIm field.<br> the AIM diffusion field around this guy was rather unstable. Even <br> when he was not doing anything obvious, she still couldn't visualise him in this state. <br> Maybe there was some power obstructing the sighting of the AIM diffusion field. <br>He is like ollerus who changed his Mana into something Inexplainable.<br>And he said about his Power:<br> "Well, my ability is still baseless! It expands endlessly! <br>I am just guessing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Considering how Gunha's power is a complete black box, and basically all other Esper powers have been analyzed, Gunha might just be able to cause reverse causality.</br>  <br><br>I assume he has a new one because he has both Accelerator and Hamazura in his contacts.</br></br>  <br>yea but that would be to easy. <br>his power is related with Ollerus power.<br>what they are doing is basically the same.Like Thor and the Holistic Esper.<br> I’m similar but different. It might be a lot like the relationship between Ollerus and the <br> exact same phenomenon, but I’m not actually one of them. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They exchange numbers in NT2. What I want to know is his phone. Damn nigga got many durable things. The jacket, the phone, the hair gel, fucking nigga</br>  Next arc involving all 3 of them fucking when?  <br><br>We need another festival arc, but it may be too soon since Ichihanaransai</br></br>  <br> Touma <br> getting anything other than suffering <br>His harem is big but its shit and full of people that will beat him down if he try making a move on someone.</br></br></br>  Wait a minute, I bet the Misaka network can p2p infinitely. The ultimate bittorrent.  <br>You're not even worth of being called a faggot.</br>  HQ SCANS WHERE  I really feel sad for Touma. He's already sleeping in the bathtub but here comes another freeloader.  When will Accel fuck Worst?  <br>The Sand Worm.<br><br>Then the Cobra.</br></br></br>  <br>But she had shitload of kids.</br>  <br>He wouldn't be in this situation if he wasn't some little bitch.</br>  <br>Aynone who still denies that Kamikoto will happen is delusional. Eat a bag of dicks Othinusfags.<br><br> Damn I wish I could belive my own lies. </br></br></br>  <br>cant help that misfortune is in love with him</br>  <br>I really don't see how he can't tell index to fuck off and let him sleep im his own damn bed.</br>  <br>He has no idea why Index is even there. This is what he's used to, and it's literally the only way things have been for him from the start. You might as well as him to change apartments. Index is a part of his status quo.</br>  <br>i wonder what will index look like after she is 18</br>  <br>Like Laura.</br>  <br>Is this an actual question? It's already been stated that she'll look like Laura.</br>  <br>so i've been wondering something for a while.<br>is index actually biologically related to laura?</br></br>  <br> yfw index is Laura's granddaughter </br>  <br>Unknown. It's a prominent fan theory that Laura+Crowley=Index</br>  <br>With zero supporting evidence, just a fun joke really.</br>  <br>Index isn't stopping him, he's just afraid he'd lose control and dick her if he had to put up with this every night. Hell, she would crawl into the tub with him if he didn't lock the door.<br><br>And she'd probably fucking scalp him if he tried locking her in the bathroom instead.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think Index has sex scenes.</br>  <br>Not from lack of trying by some characters</br>  <br>don't forget the entire anglician church would seriously try to kill him if he did.</br>    <br>He would be fine, really. He is a normal school boy after all.</br>  <br>So the reason why Touma keeps index is to cultivate and witness that growth so he can taste it fully?<br><br>And they say Aleister is a great schemer</br></br></br>  <br><br>They already think he has. That's why Stiyl isn't pleased with him even existing.</br></br>  <br> Stiyl <br> got a personal Marisa to dick (and two other sluts) <br> does nothing <br>14 year old faggot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>26 episodes:<br> 1: Vol 14 <br> 2: Vol 15 <br> 3: Vol 16 <br> 4: Vol 17 <br> 5: Vol 18 <br> 6: Vol 19 <br> 7: Vol 20 <br> 8: Vol 21 <br> 9: Vol 22 1 <br> 10: Vol 22 2 <br> 11: SS2 1 <br> 12: SS2 2 <br> 13: NT 1 <br> 14: NT 2 <br> 15: NT 3 <br> 16: NT 4 <br> 17: NT 5 <br> 18: NT 6 <br> 19: NT 7 <br> 20: NT 8 <br> 21: NT 9 1 <br> 22: NT 9 2 <br> 23: NT 10 <br> 24: NT 11 <br> 25: NT 12 <br> 26: NT 13 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 14 year old edgy faggot. <br><br>ftfy</br></br></br>  <br> cramming each volume into 1 episode <br><br>u fucking wot?</br></br></br>  <br>This would be so shit I couldn't even.

Also, you need to work with a bunch of other people. Kamachi will be fine with both of those things.</br>  Reminder that Frenda a shit and worst girl.  <br>We have limited budget, we can do it in 13 episodes:<br> 1: NT 11 (flashback parts, because we respect the timeline) + Vol 14  <br> 2: Vol 15, 19 (Thematically work together better)  <br> 3: Vol 16, 17, 18  <br> 4: Vol 20, 21, 22  <br> 5: SS2, Norse Mythology <br> 6: NT 1, 2 <br> 7: NT 3, 4 <br> 8: NT 5, 6 <br> 9: NT 7, 8 <br> 10: NT 9 (World Alpha, Beta) <br> 11: NT 9 (Panties Hell) <br> 12: NT 9 (World Omega) <br> 13: NT 10 + parts of NT 11 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that Nda&gt;Fre</br>  <br>A single route VN would be relatively easier to make. Heck, you could just do it with Adobe Flash. Adding flags and shit makes it much more complicated. You'd need at least one story writer, one character designer, a music composer, and someone to program the entire thing (The last one could be all of the former three working together. Putting up something with ActionScript 2.0 wouldn't be that hard). The only thing I don't know how to make from a basic VN in Flash would be making saves and loading them, but a pre-set scene viewer is easy to make.</br>  I dislike Othinus and her arc for precisely the same reason I dislike Sakura and Heavens Feel. Othinus and Sakura should have gotten a Superhero or Sparks Liner High ending, not a good ending. Shame Touma doesn't have an equivalent of Saber. A Saberfriend would suit him well  <br>oh yeah what happen to the crossover?<br>is the manga raws up somehwere?</br></br>  <br>http://kodoku21.blog83.fc2.com/blog<wbr>-entry-3604.html</wbr></br>  <br>I dislike Sakura and like Othinus.<br>I feel the difference is that to save Sakura Shirou has to change his ideal, while to save Othinus Touma just had to keep his. Touma never wanted to save everyone or create a perfect world, he just wants to save the people in front of him as best as he can.<br>Also the fact that Othinus had so much less actual impact by the end (with not a single kill resting in Touma's shoulders, ultimately) might have something to do with it. Helps that Touma didn't have to get amnesia too.</br></br></br>  When will we see touma being pissed as fuck again and act like what he did in ot 2?  <br>Possibly next volume when notTouma is trying to kill Othinus</br>  <br>Touma's still being forced to save someone that it would be better to not save. If Shirou turns his back on Sakura, he dies, kills everyone, or is brain dead. If Touma turns his back on Othinus, he'll probably go insane and die. And Touma pretty much did admit his ideals are bullshit too</br>  <br>when othi is kill</br>  <br> Touma pretty much did admit his ideals are bullshit too <br><br>You know what, because of him admitting that he bullshits people so he can punch them made me respect him a little.</br></br></br>  <br>When accelerator beats the shit out of him.</br>  <br>so never.</br>  <br>Oh I can understand that. I was hoping for character development there but NOPE things are back to normal except with a little more waifubait and a sprinkle of PTSD</br>  <br> Respecting a guy who allowed two world wide criminals to escape punishment </br>  <br>When Touma inevitably stops living his life correctly, someone's going to have to punch him in the face. Who better than his greatest disciple?</br>  <br>shiage or Gunha.</br>  <br>But can they tank Touma's punches like accel can?</br>  <br>You know admitting is development do you?</br>  <br>When Touma stops living his life correctly, he's going to need way more than one punch.<br><br>Every one of his friends are going to get a turn. Accel, Index, Mikoto, and Shiage being the hardest hitting.<br><br>By the end of the novel he won't have any teeth left.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> yfw the final fight is Demon Lord Touma vs Angel Accelerator with the full blessing of the Misakas <br> Accelerator wins and reverts him back to normal without killing him <br> Misakas are like "Holy fuck that was cool. Is it time to go hand Aleister his ass with my two favorite people?" <br> Aleister goes down like a bitch <br> Happy ends for everyone! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gunha definitely.<br>Shiage beat him last volume like the pussy he is.</br></br>  <br>Literally this.<br><br>Touma a shit.</br></br></br>  <br> Who better than his greatest disciple <br>Fiamma?</br></br>  <br> Shiage beat him last volume like the pussy he is. <br> mfw Hamazura fags unironically think this </br></br>  <br> yfw the final fight is Demon Lord Touma vs Angel Accelerator with the full blessing of the Misakas. <br>Yes<br> Accelerator wins and reverts him back to normal without killing him <br>just No.That´s boring.</br></br></br></br>  <br> his teeth regenerate <br> turns out Aleister stuffed them full of dragons too <br> most of the series would have been a cakewalk if he just bit people like Index </br></br></br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>Would you rather Accelerator just knock him out and a surprise Misaki saves him with an Othinus memory wipe</br>  <br>Gunha got trashed by a girl, he's weak as fuck. <br><br>At least shiage and accel been putting bitches on lock.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you sure?<br>He looks fine to me?</br></br>  <br>  Accelerator just knock him out  <br>No I want Demon king Touma just being Demon king Touma.Accelertor is and will always be the Last Boss.<br>Strong yes but in the end of the day he will be beaten.</br></br></br>  <br>I would rather it be a group effort by everyone relevant. Shiage too, since he's a protagonist after all.</br>  <br> Accelerator <br> Last boss <br><br>What? He'll be on the team against the last boss.</br></br></br></br>   guy who can cause earthquakes and whip out tornados lost to a normal highschooler with average street fighting skills <br><br>Top kek.</br></br>  <br>Everyone woks together to pin down Touma, then Index stabs him with a dagger.</br>  <br>Well Shiage and Mikoto would probably be cleaning up Demon Lord Touma's mess anyway and save a good chunk of people</br>  <br> railgun will never get good like this again </br>  <br>It might, it'll take a year or two to get there though.</br>  <br> by everyone relevant. <br>I don't think you understand what he meant.</br></br>  <br>Best thing for me would be they think they have beaten Him but in truth he just deceive them kinda like Othinius in NT8</br>  <br>Index will be on Touma team.<br>She will stab Shiage trying to beat him.</br></br>  <br>Would anyone be on his side if he goes full Demon Lord?</br>  <br>Assuming Othinus is dead, Will.</br>  <br>Touma is quite charismatic if he he want´s to be</br>  <br> wanting to show then what they wanted <br><br>and thus why the cycle of hatred never ends. Why kill them when you can change them for the greater good.</br></br></br>  <br> wanting to show then what they wanted <br>huh?</br></br>  <br>Why not?<br>I'd be really surprised if no one will join him.</br></br>  <br><br>Is Demon Lord Touma would be Kumagawa 2.0?</br></br>  <br> a sprinkle of PTSD <br>i dont think breaking down and crying like a bitch in the floor triggered by just the mention of magic gods is a "sprinkle".</br></br>  <br>Hopefully?</br>  <br>It won't be his fault.<br> MedakaDex when? </br></br>  <br>Probably but with more blank stares</br>  <br> Will and clones <br> maybe Accel if Will can force him <br> Othinus if she isn't dead <br> Nephthys </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> tfw kumagawa is basically evil touma with unlock IB/magic god power. </br></br>  <br>No one would side to him except will <br>nt9-nt10 pretty much showed how everyone will turn against him when his not living up to the expected role his given.<br><br><br> No one would go near a rabid dog they cant control.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mikoto would probably just tell him to live his life correctly with another hug of 1 billion volts.</br>  <br>He wasn't Demon King there, through.</br>  <br>He'll never be as based as kumagawa.</br>  <br>I imagine Maou Touma to be someone like Mad Scientist Shinobu.</br>  <br>Yeah he reacted the same way when he say that zouken looking nigga right?</br>  <br> I will be better than the main characters.png </br>  <br> spent most of the day running away from him on a bike <br>Seems to be still scared</br></br>  Why are the Misaka's so best?  <br>heh</br>  <br>Do you guys really want this to turn into Shana 2.0? Obviously the girls closest to him (Mikoto, Index, Othinus) would team up to tenderly beat the living hell out of him until he starts living his life correctly again.</br>  <br><br> you will never see kumagawa as MC of Index. </br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mikoto <br> close to Touma </br></br>  <br>When jsloli gets his copy in the mail.</br>  <br>Pretty much, yeah.</br>  <br>The whole point of NT13 is that, in fact, she's not close to him in any way.</br>    Why is he so much better than touma?  <br> Wow~ We're riding together. <br> I am, right now, riding together with a guy on a bicycle! <br> If I'd see this coming, I would definitely have dressed white one-piece, oh... <br><br> Misaka, try putting this in your mouth. <br> Are you kidding?! On the contrary, *****-pack will be blown off due to overheat. <br><br> No! I won't give him to you!! <br><br>Wow, did she confess to him in NT volumes?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> smiling when he beat up Touma <br>He's shit.</br></br>  <br> The whole point of NT13 is that, in fact, she's not close to him in any way. </br>  <br>No, and after this volume it's doubtful she ever will.</br>    <br>Are you stupid?</br>  <br> not wanting to smile after beating the shit out of complete faggot </br>  <br> Touma trying to save his sorry ass <br> Hamazura barely manages to scrap a win even though he was in a fucking mech <br> Touma is the faggot </br></br></br>  <br>Not the guy you replied to and not a huge fan of Hamazura but shit eating Touma cocksuckers are a good bit of the reason I hate Touma. Always have, always will</br>  <br>I'm not a Toumafag, but that's literally what happened in NT12.</br>  I like Mikoto, but I want her to get hurt.<br><br>Aleister's favorite or not, its getting silly how she keeps walking out of meatgrinders without so much as a broken bone or nasty cut when the other prominent fives have been horribly maimed, Kuroko has been shot and stabbed on multiple occasions, Saten nearly got murdered by Murrica, Uiharu got tortured and fucked up her hands stopping the truck, and Kongou got the crap beaten out of her. The most damage she ever took was the fight with Mugino and that was still so little she slept it off.</br></br>  <br> letting a fanbase affect you in anyway </br>  <br>Mikoto's plot armor is greater than Accel, Touma and Hamazura's combined.</br>  <br>Mikoto will never, ever lose a real fight. She will never be injured enough to go to the hospital, she will never get mindbroken. She will continue to be the perfect companion when you need someone reliable to help you out.</br>  <br>I want her to get hurt so   a nearby Accelerator can save her because seeing it reminds him of the Sisters Project. I want this so it will flip her worldview upside down </br>  <br>Touma is shit even without his shit fan base</br>  <br>That actually sounds like it would be amazing. However, the fact that it would be good means that it won't happen. Kamachi will just continue to maintain the status quo because  it  is a hack.</br>  <br>She is hardly in any fights though.</br>  <br>Kamachi is just a shit writer.</br>  <br>I want to see her face when she's like "Y-you mean not everything is black and white? T-things are more complicated than I thought?" It would be awesome.</br>  <br>I'm sure that you are a much better writer than it anon, why don't you publish your own book?</br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br>Mikoto is literally so good that she managed to beat ITEM while running at like 5 percent her normal strength.</br>  <br>Oh shit not this again</br>  <br>ITEM is just incompetent as fuck, anon.</br>  <br>She still needed a man in shinning armor who can wipe the floor with her if he wants to defeat an Esper she couldn't ever hope to even scratch and stop the experiments.</br>  <br>That's fine, since it gave us one of the best scenes in the series.</br>  <br> Mugino <br> not retarded <br>laughinghamazura.jpg</br></br></br>  <br>It was still good when Frenda easily tricked her and kicked her bony ass.</br>  Reminder that Touma agrees that Mikoto is useless and a burden. Mikotofags BTFO.  <br>To be fair, there wasn't really many on the Science Side who cold take on Accel at the time.</br>  <br> Frenda <br>LOL</br></br>  <br> LOL <br> Mikotofags </br></br>  <br> Wasn't many <br>Pretty much no one.</br></br>  <br>Only two people I think.</br>  <br>Frenda is shit, so that makes it all more embarrassing for Mikoto.<br><br>Also, she's fucking retarded for paralyzing the tongue of someone she wants to interrogate.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Amata and maybe Kakine. <br><br>If Touma didn't found about the Sisters and instead Kakine did, would Mikoto pledge loyalty to SCHOOL in exchange for the life of her clones?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Without Touma Mikoto would have just killed herself against Accelerator. Maybe if Kakine beat Accelerator and saved the sisters she would love him but that's entirely out of character for Kakine.</br>  <br>Maybe Gunha?</br>  <br><br>Electricity users are just that strong.</br></br>  <br>Reminder that Cole a shit compared to Misaka. Even Last Order is stronger than him.</br>  Reminder that even if Mikoto and Touma had done nothing, the Sisters wouldn't have all died. Aleister would have called a halt to it or given Accelerator the okay to back out of the project which he never wanted to do in the first place  <br>Gunha's attacks are strange but still abide the laws of physics, right? So Accel's powers would wok on him. It would be a draw if Gunha can keep up or Accel wins.</br>  <br> actually believing Accelerator really would have killed her when he didn't the first time </br>  <br> still abide the laws of physics <br>Nah, they are simply bullshit, like, they just work.</br></br>  <br>He would have.</br>  <br> implying he wouldn't have just clicked his tongue at her, called her a moron and went about his business </br>  <br>No, he would be pissed and just kill her anon. Accelerator wasn't a good guy.</br>  <br>I think you're severely underestimating his psychosis at this point in the story.</br>  <br>He didn't fucking kill her the first time so why would the second time be any different? Even if she was retardedly determined to kill herself using his power, Aleister would have stepped in.</br>  <br>She was desperate enough to kill herself. She'd take that deal in a heartbeat, though she'd probably be nearly as desperate to get out after the first few jobs.</br>  <br> Aleister would have stepped in. <br>Touma was Aleister stepping in</br></br>  <br> filename <br><br>Post discarded</br></br></br>  <br> Implying  <br><br>Nigga would smack her shit up with that amp.</br></br></br>  <br>Original&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Clones&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Cole</br>  <br> he doesn't think accel raped them </br>  <br>True, Touma stepping in meant Aleister didn't have to do shit. But I don't think he intentionally sent Touma in to fix it</br>  <br>He didn't although your edgy teenage mind thinks he did. Either that or you're just posting for replies</br>  <br>He's right you know. Accelerator must have raped them, it's the only logical thing to do.</br>  <br>Misaka is one of the weakest electricity users I've ever seen.</br>  <br> 1 billion volts <br> 360 Radar Sense <br> Iron Sand <br> Magnetism  <br> Hacking <br> weak </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> All of that shit listed and she barely won against Item </br>  <br>Mad Scientist Shinobu meet Demon Lord Touma and Object Creator Quenser when?</br>  <br>U mad.</br>  <br>Why is her electricity attacks slow as fuck? Niggas be catching that shit.</br>  <br> light speed <br> "slow" </br></br>  <br/>  <br>I don't think she needs to be super hurt but she can at least get hit. dodging by skill is one thing but anything she can't stop is blocked by a third party. Or just get btfo by good magicians like everyone else.</br>  <br>The time will come, and Mikotofags will get BTFO when that happens.<br><br> muh super special snowflake girl that never gets hurt and everything works out of her gets a taste of her own medicine! </br></br></br>  <br> Light speed <br><br>Sure.</br></br></br>  <br>That's not unusual considering that modern fashion is all about making yourself look like a hobo.</br>  <br>Author descrpition&gt;&gt;&gt;your opinion</br>  <br>I'm sure there are more Mikotofags who want to see her get hurt in a srious fight than haters.</br>  <br> The authors description is never bs </br>  <br>Kamachi is just a retard with no sense of scale.<br>According to him, Mikoto's railgun is just as fast as a bullet and high powered AC sniper rifles apparently shoot bullets at a velocity equivalent to a low powered modern day pistol.</br></br>  <br>Kamachi puts a lot more research into his magic than his science.</br>  Didn't kamachi say that hamazura smelled the carbon monoxide in NT12  <br>No he smelled a byprodukt from carbon monoxide</br>  <br>Hamazura always has a good nose, it's probably his esper power or something.</br>  <br>Maybe they've got futuristic CO detectors that output a distinctive smell rather than beeping.</br>  <br>Touma and Gunha can both block attacks that are impossible to block.</br>  <br>He's a level 0 Super Sniffer.<br><br>The one power Touma is actually jealous of.</br></br></br>    <br>christ go back to your underdeveloped, needing help from middle schoolers Akatsuki Kojou</br>  I'm still reading volume 18...  <br> buy a fancy new CO detector <br> emits a pleasant cherry scent <br> just want to keep smelling it </br></br></br>  <br>Anon, don't tell you don't like British halloween.</br>  Not gonna lie, I stopped at vol 13 and SS1 because I want to experience everything in anime format before reading it. I think it's more fun that way.  <br>I still find the "ecchi parts" awkward.</br>  <br>Hope you have fun waiting</br>  <br>You can experience NT 9 in 20 years. That's something nice to look forward to.</br>  <br>Index is pretty much shit before vol 14<br><br>You're missing out on like 1/4-1/5 of the content by not reading it.<br><br>I'd say read through the entirety of it so you can get to NT9</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At this rate you'll probably see the actual WWIII before you see WWIII.</br>  <br>After all this time and countless anime, I still don't understand why do we need ecchi. If I wanted to watch a hentai, I would have watched a hentai. When I want to watch a battle shounen, I want to watch cool powers used in creative ways and over the top fights.</br>  Is it normal that I fucking hate Kamijou? Shiage and Accelerator are way more interesting.<br><br>I hope it gets better. I have seen many spoilers like people "crying" about Othinus arc or that Kamijou has dragon in his right hand.</br></br>  <br>Material for the waifufags. Unfortunately it's a staple of the genre. Very occasionally I find it funny, at least.</br>  <br>Tell me one successfull LN without ecchi.</br>  <br>Where are you up to? He's pretty bland initially but I can't think of anything that would make you hate him.</br>  I just finished watching everything Raildex related.. still have one question: What did Touma and Index hear at the last scene of Endymion?  <br> spoilers <br> that Kamijou has dragon in his right hand <br><br>You just watched the first few episodes of the anime and came here immidiately?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yahari.</br>  <br>I mean this <br><br><br>I'm  with Carissa.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It does have fanservice, at least, in the earlier novels. Not as much as your usual novel, though, yeah.</br>  <br>Those, Dragons, oh. Well, they are from the Railgun manga.</br>  <br>Maybe I just have to give up on Touma and go for Biribiri.</br>  <br> Is it normal that I fucking hate Kamijou? <br><br>Completely. Honestly, outside of Japan and little fandom enclaves like the one at /a/, Touma's very much an acquired taste.</br></br></br>  What non saint or magicians can beat mikoto excluding obvious ones like olly and up.  <br>This. Touma a shit, and people just like him because the MC or as a meme. I can't stand him or Othinus. And I've never liked him.</br>  <br> tfw i use to kinda like Touma but then NT happened </br>  <br>It depends if they can block electricity. If they can't she can just fry them before they do their magic</br>  <br>People like different things, shocking uh?</br>  <br>I'm pretty much the opposite. Touma was just kinda there to me until NT</br>  <br>Touma's a shit. People only like him because he's the MC, he's a meme, for his retarded suffering, or as a waifu prize.</br>  <br>You sure know how to convince people with your arguments anon.</br>  <br>Mikoto is a better character than Touma when she's nowhere near him</br>  <br>Fuking this. Touma needs to fuck off from railgun.</br>  <br>But it's true. I'm not here to convince you or argue with you anyway</br>  <br>or they need to fuck off from interacting period. I hope NT13 seals a distance between them</br>  <br>I'd take a deal to get Touma off of Railgun and Mikoto off of Index</br>  so in the end what's it gonna be:<br><br>touma x misaka OR touma x index?<br><br>i am rooting for misaka x [spolier]kuroko[/spoiler]</br></br></br></br>  <br>This. Only have Mikoto appear in the main series when she's needed. And by "needed" I don't mean shipperfag scenes with a guy who's shit anyway and probably not going to survive the series as is</br>  <br>But misaka sells index.</br>  I just started reading the LN and jesus fuck, why didn't anyone tell me Frenda gets killed of like that.<br><br> Why the fuck is it that every minor character I take a liking to gets cut in half? </br></br>  <br>It's not a battle royale if no one gets brutally killed right?</br>  <br> ctrl+s </br>  <br>I want to lick Mugino's belly.</br>  <br>How could you be in these threads and still not know? Half the jokes are about her.</br>  <br>Kakine not dying is fucking bs.</br>  <br>Because I don't bother with these threads until like 2 days ago.<br><br>I wasn't being serious with the whole "anyone didn't tell me" part.</br></br></br>  <br>Worst girl on the left kills the pic.</br>  <br>It tastes like silicon.</br>  <br>why?<br>shes insane</br></br>  Johnny best JoJo followed by Josuke<br><br>http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87</br></br>  I'm sorry Joestars I can't hear you over all of this freedom.
