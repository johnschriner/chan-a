Is the romance progressing satisfactorily? I don't want to be addicted to another never-ending nisekoi  <br>  That bitch was the first to lose </br>  <br>Childhood friends could never be legitimate love interest, silly.</br>  Holy fuck new chapter when? Why did the scanlation staff have to be cancer and go to AX?    <br>Oh, that is what you mean? No, she lost hard. Closure and everything.<br>Unsurprising, people need to act like that to spur the changes and plot advancement.<br><br>Such is the lot of best girl. I'm glad we at least got that much for her. More than some get.</br></br></br></br>  So what can we expect out of Zouken Matou clone?<br><br>also Index NT13 thread</br></br>  <br> projecting this hard <br>what a fucboi</br></br>  <br> Also how are all these people fitting in Touma's tiny ass apartment. <br>Maybe all magic gods can also go tiny mode? It's not that out of the question compared to the shit they do.</br></br>  <br>after. Apparently she escaped death because she generated from a fucking organ and since probably nowhere else to go she probably seek out touma for help to freeload on his apartment.</br>  <br>Wait there is a new freeloader again!<br><br>Great</br></br></br>    Are you ready for Smith? jesus Lerche is doing a really good job here and the censorships is almost nonexistant.<br><br>Manga:<br> 8 days until chapter 35  <br>Since secondaries are going rampage again spamming thread without even knowing what are they watching, lets have a better thread.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Mutio after catching Blue Sub 6 on Toonami. <br>my nigga</br></br>  <br>The oneshots or MGQ, not sure which i got exposed to first.</br>  How does one scare a monster girl?  <br>Ariel was kind of a moron though</br>  <br>Much like this.</br>  was Gendo Ikari banging Rei?  <br>Rei is an ugly girl, they're being true to the character.</br>  <br>Has this Rei been drinking the LCL?</br>  <br>LCL is delicious.</br>  <br> Asuka ignoring all the boys, just being pure in the corner <br>Everyone has already slept with Asuka.

Fuck no, he'll keep them out of spite for his grandkids to learn. <br>Or because they're actually useful. As long as the need to handwrite is there, you'll see them learning Kanji. And it'll be a long time (if ever) for pen and paper to disappear. Hell, I still handwrite a fucking lot.</br></br>  You only need like 1000 kanji to write anyways, it's not that big a deal. You just need to be able to write enough words in kanji for it to be more readable, and the rest you can just write in kana.  <br><br>You people are talking about it as if we were talking about some schematics for building a bridge. Stuff like kanji are deeply intertwined in the culture. It's about as likely to go as the Latin alphabet is in English.</br></br>  <br>Because I can already watch anime raw so thought I'd learn how to read it too. I also got a couple jap friends I chat with every now and then.<br><br>Will search for something to read later I guess</br></br></br>  <br><br>Where did you get Japanese friends?<br><br>Online? IRL?

We still don't know and we might never know.</br>  <br>well fuck you kishi for making my waifu to let it rot then</br>  <br> looks like Guy in every way except the eyes <br>How the fuck are they not related again?</br></br>  <br> Youth is actually a degenerative disease that destroys the ninjutsu and genjutsu centers of a ninja's body, replacing them with taijutsu. This also results in increased hair around the eyebrows area and a propensity for bowlcuts and really gay tights. </br>  <br> Guy's bloodline is finished <br><br>Goddamn it.</br></br></br>  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87 <br><br> 100+ years old <br> still looking relatively youthful and able to fight hordes of vampires with his students and easily dispatch them <br> can heal people using his ripple <br> can see the future of people using his ripple <br><br>Were all subsequent ripple users shit because they were selfish and didn't maintain their training into old age? Also did Tonpetty have a stand?

Pls no bully.  <br>Ima bully</br>  You best get used to seeing tears here.   You see, in the mid-1800s (when Egypt-mania really took off in the Western world), white people who marveled at these giant ancient constructs applied their strongest racist science and assumed the Egyptians were pasty Aryan Europeans, specifically because only white people could have the technical ability to build the pyramids. Others theorized that they were black, due to the fact that Egypt is, you know, in Africa. <br>At least we know they play card game with stone tablet</br>    Konami. Master of template   tfw we'll never get a YGO protagonist who uses IgKnights or Burning Abyss to ignite the masses burning souls in glorious battle da   Who's the most kissable Yugioh character?</blockquote>]
