Reminder: All girls are best girls  It's a little tsun in here~  <br>RIP lightly salted chips</br>  <br>I wonder why that could be</br>  <br><br>This show could use more gay</br></br>  <br>S3 is going to be gayer that ever!</br>  My heart beats only for Ayano.   less than 10 days to announcement     Chiina-chu is still not a bully!  <br>Daw what a cuite.</br>  <br>she's a bully for slowing down my browser</br>  <br>Lesbian rape bully.</br>  Kyouko x Ayano <br>Akari x Chinatsu<br>These are the only truths I know in life.</br></br>  <br>0_0<br><br><br>I agree with you on the first part. If you don't see that, it's like not noticing a baseball bat to the face.<br>The second one is a little more subtle in my opinion.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to be their PE teacher and lock then up inside the gym storage room. Like the drama CD.</br>  <br>it's not rape if you both enjoy it</br>  <br>It's subtle, but when you think about it, it works.. so well.<br><br>But who does that leave for Yui?</br></br></br>  <br>Wait. Wait wait wait.<br><br>WHA?? Where is this CD and where can I find a translation? Anon I need this. I need this a lot right now / forever.</br></br></br>  Time to sniff ass.  <br>Kyouko x Yui is canon <br><br> But who does that leave for Yui? <br>No-one, that's why it will never happen<br>Ayano has Chitose, who loves her more than anyone</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know...</br>  <br>Kyouko and Yui are just childhood friends. You never choose the childhood friend for love interest.</br>  <br> you will never sniff Ayano's butt so hard that her bra falls off <br>why even continue living?</br></br>  We must purify the thread with Best BFFs    <br>More like best GFs</br>  <br>-Ayano is madly in love with Kyouko.<br>-Kyouko literally sniffs Ayano's shoes.<br>-They are paired together by fate more often than anyone.<br> not canon </br></br></br></br>  <br> why even continue living? <br>I ask this every night.</br></br>  i have over 1000 screenshots from the yuru yuri anime<br>  save me from myself  </br>  <br>lets just cut to the chase. We know who the real OTP is.<br><br><br>post them.<br> all of them. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  It's too late  </br>  <br>Did Kyouko transfer to a different school or something in this pic?</br>  <br>butts do have that nice... butt smell.</br>  posting best girl and you cant stop me   Even with your big boobs   <br>This makes my heart hurt<br>Himawari is Saku's and no one else's</br></br>  <br>  they have the subtitles in them because i was too lazy to remove them every time i wanted to take a screenshot  <br>i'm a failure</br></br>  <br> Kyouko transfered to a different school <br>That's perfect, now the real OTP can be together</br></br>  <br><br>disgusting how you people don't recognise the three of them as the OTT</br></br>  <br><br>One would normally post the OTP whilst saying that, friend.</br></br>  <br>You will put them into one file, and upload them for us.<br>  please, you're doing gods work  </br></br>  <br>They're both in high school.<br>I think Yuru Yuri is destined to ascend one day.</br></br>  <br>what's with the sharpness and contrast? you're disgusting, anon-chan.</br>  <br>*OTF</br>  <br>you know its the real deal anon. don't resist. true love conquers all.</br>  <br>they're on the way</br>  <br>if they're both in Highschool then why is Yui still wearing her middle school uniform?<br>Also why would Ayano put her towel in the water like that? Doesn't that defeat the whole purpose of a towel?</br></br>  <br> vlcsnap </br>  <br>hey, you know me</br>  <br> Original True Fuckers <br>Anon, you're so lewd.</br></br>  <br>Shy girls (i.e. Ayano) would take the towels into the bath to hide their privates. Japanese bathhouses have separate towels for covering up and drying.</br>  <br>If anon is offering a folder of 1000 yuru images, you thank and take it, no matter what.</br>  <br>A shame that doujin's so short. I think the art is adorable. And needed more Student Council.</br>  <br>Oh ok. <br>One day I'll get to visit a bathhouse and grope school girls. One day!</br></br>  <br>Too short indeed.</br>  <br>This is the way of our people.</br>  <br>are you ready?<br>  it's uploading faster in dropbox than it is in mega. so i'll be dropping a dropbox link soon  </br></br>  <br>Yui is the best in this</br>  Just popping in to say that I fucking love Yuruyuri  <br>thanks dad</br>  <br>No translation. It's in one of the tokuten specials, which are CDs bundled with S1 BDs. I forgot which one.<br><br>You can roughly understand what's going on with a few years of watching anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, we're all ready, I'm sure. Now, let's compare Yuri Yuri folder size. This folder does not contain the anime itself.</br>  <br>no need for a dick measuring contest anon.   considering you already saw my 1 gb folder ;~;  </br>  <br><br>top kek.</br></br>    <br><br><br><br>https://www.dropbox.com/s/ee0gr84tl<wbr>65ciaz/yuru%20yuri.zip?dl=0<br>go forth</br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  my yryr folder is only 300 mb because i keep only the finest, hand-picked, max-quality jpg files.  also pngs for transparency and a few gifs   <br>Not webbums?</br>  <br>i think i have a couple</br>  <br>You've done well.<br>Now we wait about 7 hours for the download to complete.</br></br>  <br> not having blazing fast internet connection <br>the yurus would be upset with you</br></br>  Yuru Yuri made me gay and I'm not even a girl!  <br>Anon, you are so based.</br>  <br>You were gay to begin with anon. Embrace the gay.</br>  <br>I have 9 minutes.<br>Are you using dialup?<br>I could mail you a CD if it's going to take too long.</br></br></br>  <br>Yuru Yuri should be banned! It's hypnotising our children!</br>  <br>But I have good internet! I would like to blame dropbox for this.<br>Will wait, though.</br></br>  Yuru Yuri made me like NTR.  <br>Where?</br>  <br>Mine's 4 times faster. I don't know if that's good or not.</br>  <br>In my kokoro.</br>  <br>it'd take me 2 hours to upload to mega tho. so who knows. it's in your hands now</br>  <br>Good enough to not take more than a few minutes to download a gig.<br><br><br>Don't worry, I'll find a way. I'll find... a way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>best of luck to you</br>    <br>cute</br>  I want to hug Yui!  Goodnight /ayano/<br><br> I love you </br></br>    <br><br><br><br> "Check Bakkin <br> "no new YrYr chapters" <br><br>"Delete this thread, OP"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>there was a new Yuyushiki chapter</br>  <br>Who're they?</br>  <br>reading a 4-koma and watching a 4-koma are not the same to me. still waiting on yys s2</br>  <br>the girl is Namori</br>  <br>That's Chitose.</br>  <br>You are a god amongst men.</br>  time for bed. i love all of you girls!  <br>Namori and K-On creator man</br>  tfw no season 1  <br> mfw chitose was namori all along </br>  <br>In that case, she should make her own spinoffs of the "fantasies" she has for her characters.</br>  Update: nearly there. Yuru's nearly obtained.  <br><br>Is this the highest resolution available? Still, she actually looks kinda cute.</br></br>      <br>You don't have to leave, you know.</br>  <br>What a cute pre-sea urchin.<br><br>omg so much yuru yuri now. Anon you are the best.</br></br></br>  so much loli     praise being given for a large collection of screenshots with terrible filters and subtitles left on <br><br>why do you people not have standards. i bet you like chizuru, too.</br></br>    <br><br>Google image search, guys. That's Aki Toyosaki.</br></br>  <br> not appreciating a Yuru Community contribution <br> not doing anything but sitting upon your fat bottom. <br>Has Yuru Yuri taught you nothing?</br></br></br>  <br>Welcome back anon-chan!</br>  <br>dat Aki.</br>  "Dad and Mom are out on a date."<br>"I need to have some fun."<br>Jesus this girl is lewd lewd lewd.<br> I &lt;3 her. </br></br></br>  We all saved a version of this pic.<br>Don't pretend like you didn't.<br><br>Anon I'm having so much fun posting your pictures!</br></br></br>  <br>that quality tho</br>  <br>some of us have dial up...</br>  Free lum laisin for the first person who knows the connection between these  4  girls.    <br>same magazine? same VA?</br>  <br>Dogakobo.</br>  <br> filename <br>anon that is very lewd.</br></br>  <br><br>Bingo! Unfortunately, you free rum raisin has reportedly been stolen. Witnesses slaim that they saw a "young girl, age 13 or 14, with blond hair and a hair ribbon" fleeing the scene with the ice cream.</br></br>  <br>I'm kinda worried that the production company is changing... Doga is so good. But I have high hopes. The OVA was quality. Different, but quality.</br>  <br><br>Me and my fucking typos. Ugh.</br></br>  <br>But no one would steal rum raisin ice cream except for Kyouko.<br>I'm starting to realize that Kyouko probably acquired a taste for run raisin ice cream just so that no body would want to steal her snacks. Whereas on the other hand Ayano had to worry about getting her snacks stolen all the time.</br></br>  <br>That would be very crafty...<br>Kyouko also seems like the type who would enjoy alcohol.</br></br>  So are they really making an announcement? Is it going to happen? Yuru Yuri for Fall 2015?  <br>it happens to the best of us anon.</br>  I feel like my time with Yuru's has changed my life.<br>I'm not sure if it's for the better yet, but I think so.</br>  <br>I trust in the quality.<br>Who is the new production company?</br></br>  <br>its for the better anon!</br>  <br>b-but i have tried to contribute every once in a while</br>  <br> Fall <br>What?</br></br>  <br>it's pretty soon anon</br>  <br>It's TYO, right?<br><br><br>Ok, that's too soon. But Nachuyachumi!+ is airing in August.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good for you anon!<br><br><br>Pickles are way better than Yen anyway. Pickle currency will be the next big thing.</br></br></br></br>  This picture gives me some strange feels  Mmm~  <br>Chizuru is perfect.</br>  <br>H..how is TYO?<br>Looking up what they've done, it's almost nothing of real note other than Yuru. To me, anyway.<br>The OVA was real nice though, so I don't have many worries.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to kiss her cheeks. You know which ones.</br>  <br>Her... face, right?</br>  <br>The left ones?</br>    This thread  <br>But i'm really cute</br>  <br>p-post proof</br>      <br> Man these screenshots are really bad quality. </br>  <br>BULLSHIT!</br>  <br>Does this look like a bully to you?</br>  <br><br>Does this?</br></br>    <br>She just didn't know how to properly show her love back then! It's passionate rape!</br>    <br>what is this<br>thumbnail looked fine<br>help</br></br></br>    <br>It's Google Deep Dream.</br>  <br>i just found out what it is<br>jesus that is spooky</br></br>      <br>It looks like there are two dogs, one on either side of her.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Shin translated those, anon.</br>  <br>Oh right. I listened to it raw because they were pretty late. They haven't finished subbing all of the drama CDs, have they?</br>  <br>Same, I ended up listening to the subs for them after as well. To my knowledge only CDs 1-3 are subbed right now, though.</br>  Also,  CD #2 is the one you're looking for (but might as well listen to them all)  PE episode fucking when<br>TYO i believe in you</br>   come back 3 hours later <br> people complaining about my screenshots <br>why I never</br></br>  <br>Anon, anon! Don't worry! It's me! From hours ago! It's still downloading!</br>  <br>How could they!</br>  <br>Why do you have the contrast on so high?</br>  <br>i don't? it's the default setting for me. I only upped the sharpness a bit.<br><br>i admire your dedication</br></br></br>  <br> i don't <br>Did you use print screen or the screencap function built in into your player? Because you should really get Lasik surgery if you can't see how your screenshots have too much contrast.</br></br>  <br>I don't know enough about anything to properly describe this, but it looks off. Like the colors and everything.</br>  <br>vlc's screencap<br>and yeah i actually do wear glasses. <br><br>i don't know how it got like that. it looks fine to me though. it's not like they're unusable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are there people out there who wouldn't download this even on dial up speeds?</br>  <br>well apparently it isn't worth it because the color is off and my eyes are shit. lol</br>  <br> i actually do wear glasses. <br>Same here but I think you should change your settings a bit.</br></br>  <br>i'll go back and take a look at em. but i don't watch on my laptop anymore because i have my pc. plus streaming is more convenient. <br> inb4 streamfag <br>fuck you i don't want to wait 30 minutes to download a 2 minute Teekyuu episode</br></br></br>  <br>Now that I have sanic speed internet and a hard drive I just download everything and keep what I like. Biggest downside to streaming is dealing with streaming sites.</br>  <br>In the mean time could you not post any more images, I think that one burned out my retinas.</br>  <br> TYO animates Yui and Ayano changing their clothes <br> full of fanservice </br></br>  <br>i want this part to be animated</br>  New from Namori-sensei on Twitter.<br><br>What is Chinatsu whispering to Akari?</br></br>  <br>Welcome back!</br>  <br><br>Psst, Akari-chan!

I love yuru yuri, but English dub fucking when?  <br>die</br>  <br>god dammit anon, it loses its charm if you can actually understand what they are saying, have you not learned this yet?</br>  <br><br>I don't prefer the dub, I just enjoy rewatching shows when they get a dub. It makes them feel new again</br></br>  <br>Dubs are for plebs. You should fight your disgusting urges.</br>  Why is Kyouko such a pedophile?  <br>Hopefully never</br>  <br>loliYui X Mari when?</br>  <br>Kyouko x LoliYui x Mari threesome or gtfo</br>  <br>Totally agreed. I couldn't imagine any 'English anime voice actors' doing the voices for any of the yurus. They are just so perfect now, dubbing the show will just destroy one of the most core aspects of the show.<br><br>Just remember, it doesn't matter what you watch, from anime to "art" films, always sub never dub. Dubbing is always inferior to subbing.<br><br>I hope the Mari/Kaede chapter is either in season 3 or the OVAs.

I love a good tearjerker.</br></br>  <br>YEEART!</br>  <br>YEEART!</br>  <br>YEEART!</br>  <br>YEEART!</br>  <br>YEEART!</br>  <br>Yukano goes evil? Christ, Ninja slayer you had one job.</br>  <br>Domo, Natsuki-desu.</br>  <br>Well, it's not completely his fault, since her Ninja alias is  Amnesia </br>  <br>She just is.</br>  <br>might as well publish it now, it's not like it's hard to tell where the story of the cancer-stricken killer ninja is heading</br>  <br>Fuck.</br>  <br>I sort of hoped we would get more info on Nancy's background this week, but I'm also extremely pleased that we're getting more Koki, so I can't complain.</br>  <br>So is she got her memories back yet?</br>  <br>Whoops! Didn't mean to quote. Please accept this Nancy-san as an apology.</br>  <br>Hey man, Hell if I know. I'm just getting this from untranslated manga pages. Even I can read katakana.</br>  <br>Best Nancy NA.</br>  <br>Perfection</br>  <br><br>AMPLE</br></br>  <br>YEEART</br>  <br>YEEART!</br>  I want to protect Koki!<br>This episode was pretty heavy. I liked Kagi's exaggerated laid-back personality.</br>  <br>I want to protect her smile!</br>  <br>It was a good episode.<br><br>Next one will be one hell of a heart breaker.</br></br></br>  Man, i expect anything from Ninja Slayer, but not this<br>Good episode</br>  Did Silver Karasu appear in the mangas/official novel art yet?  <br>Don't tell me Kagi-san accepts the order of Smiling Old Man-san, and he and Yamoto have to fight<br>My Kokoro (TN: Kokoro is japansese HEART) is not ready</br></br>  Did this show get fun again yet? I used to enjoy Ninja Slayer a lot, but I sorta lost interest by the time they were trying to upload that one virus or whatever.  <br> yee ART!</br>  <br>True, it's not the most unexpected twist ever, but I was just wondering whether I should move things around in my schedule. If no one minds, I'll get chapter 4 tomorrow and the last one next Friday.<br><br><br>Yes, he did. Not in the manga, though.<br><br><br> She did get her memory back, but it's not like Amnesia is evil. She was picked up by the revolutionaries and was one of their top agents. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    damn that was a good episode.  <br><br>Ninja Slayer is not a "fun" show,<br><br>fun is something for children<br><br>Ninja Slayer is a deep analytical experience<br><br>This frame along contains at least 20 complex themes and it's no surprise many people dropped this show.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Seems so. That, or something equally heartbreaking.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127833403 <br>Why not both?</br>  <br><br>Why not both?</br></br>  <br>I'm guessing he'll fight Yamoto as a 'final training exercise,' nips love that stuff.</br>  Someone put all of Nancy's bondage into one webm right.  <br>YEEART!</br>  Reminder that Koki's stories are some of the darkest in Ninja Slayer. She's never allowed to be happy for very long in this series. Neither is a Ninja slayer himself to be honest.  <br>YEEART!</br>  <br>Yeah. Koki and Fuji won't gonna have anything good happening to them until the end.</br>  <br>YEEART!</br>  <br>Sweet mercy.</br>  <br>What is this?</br>  <br>A poll that the viewers take after watching each episode. 1 is "Really enjoyed", 5 is "Shit sucks". Note that the first episode had about 75% votes for 5.</br>  best subs are out  <br>For some reason I was already tearing up when he was teaching Koki karate (the music and his voice acting, I guess). Can't wait for the next episode to fuck my shit up.</br>  <br>It's understandable though. I love the series now, looking forward to the new episodes all the time - but I was very much on the verge of dropping it in the beginning. It took a little while to realize how hilarious the 'flaws' are.</br>  Man that was great, I'm super hyped for the next episode.  <br>As soon as I saw his design I thought, damn that's so cool.<br><br>I know, the whole episode flowed really nicely with the music too, it's going to be sad as fuck in sort of a good way I bet.</br></br></br>  <br>Indeed.<br><br><br><br>It's going to be a punch in the guts next episode.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>YEEART!</br>  Man, this was an amazing episode.  <br>How the hell did she lost her memories? And who is the revolutionaries?</br>  <br> The cause is unknown and pretty much handwaved, it might've been the shock of surviving Darkninja's attack, or it might've been a self-induced condition. The revolutionaries are just what they sound like, the people who oppose the current government (which mostly consists of Soukaiya's sock puppets). </br>  <br>YEEART!</br>  <br>Her  dub voice  is going to sound terrible. Then again, same thing happened with the other girls.</br>  <br>It was okay last episode.<br>At least, okay compared to Koki's.</br></br>  When do we get the ED's?  <br>July 26th, at least the first 13.<br><br>By the way, these bitches will be singing the next one.<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gQpM<wbr>iooyBWM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Where at? &gt;inb4 torrent</br>  <br>Poor homicidal punk-san. He just wanted to shoot people.</br>  <br>There is going to be an entire album of them. Since we got the OST leaked, I assume someone will leak the EDs, too.  Otherwise, I'll just buy and rip it like I did with the drama CD OST. <br><br>The first two EDs are already available on Japanese iTunes and other similar services, but no one bothered buying and sharing them at this point.</br></br></br>  <br>YEEART!</br>  <br>Thanks. Have a Koki.</br>  Yea but what about Yukano  Weekly bust poll:<br><br> AMPLE <br> ABUNDANT <br> ABSENT </br></br></br></br>  Am I the only one who found this part hot?

And WASHOI is for general movement.</br>  <br>Hey, that's not true, nobody has threaded to rape Yukino.</br>  <br>YEEART!</br>  <br>Yeah i meant in general usage.<br>ABBAH was king this episode, with a couple of AIEEE's</br></br>  <br>Because the slut hands out more pussy than an animal shelter.</br>  Thought this was probably the best episode to date, No stupid shit happening just an emotional story.  <br>ABBAH is also interchangeable with GUWAH. Also, WASSHOI is mostly reserved to Ninja Slayer himself, as no one else says it.<br><br><br>Because tightest pussy.<br><br><br>Really fitting the mood of the episode. Not as good as in episode 3, but it's close.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>YEEART</br>  Shit, next week is gonna be sad as fuck isn't it?  <br>Prepare your tissues and chocolate ice cream.</br>  <br><br>who is it by anyway?</br></br>  <br>Shit.</br>  <br>By Drop's, it's written right there.</br>  <br>Excellent episode indeed. I've been waiting for some more Koki for weeks upon weeks and they finally delivered. Her pussy was just as insanely tight as ever. It really is no wonder villains keep wishing to rape her, but they can never have her.</br>  Domo, Actual Animation desu.<br><br><br>Trigger poured their heart and soul into this episode.</br></br></br>  <br>They always do for Koki episodes, it's clear she's their favorite just like blue hair from Inou Battle was.</br>  <br>Just noticed that he has the same pink highlight as Yamoto.</br>  <br>I've observed that when a episode is to have a lot of action/funny moments, it has little actual animation and more Inferno Cop in it.<br><br>When it's about something serious, then the actual animation is more present.</br></br></br>  <br>YEEART!</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Post more Koki.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Wasshoi.</br>  Nancy is boring  <br><br>Actually even her ass might be the tightest</br></br>  <br>I'd totally wear that as a hawaiian shirt.</br>  <br> Flat-chested girls like you aren't my type <br>Nutcracker=san confirmed for shit taste</br></br>  <br>Sonic Boom=SAN, you are dead and your taste in clothes is shit.</br>  Nice episode.  <br>Agreed. ABSENT is clearly best bust.</br>  I just finished the YEEART compilation for the last two episodes of the dub<br><br>too bad youtube decided it wants to be a faggot all of a sudden and is taking fucking forever to process the video</br></br>  I want to protect Koki.  <br>Her body though</br>  <br><br><br>Okay, it finished being dumb<br><br>here's the video<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Za4<wbr>UO-uZnOg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>so she's gonna learn iaido style right?</br></br>  <br>pretty much.</br>  hahaha, i watched ep 12 of this just now<br><br>is this supposed to be a parody of anime or something? got agood laugh out of it</br></br>  <br><br>neat.</br></br>  <br><br> nggh! <br> nggh! <br> ngaaah!!! <br><br> YEAAAARRT </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit my fucking penis.</br>   episode 13 ED   Woah, was this Ninja Slayer? This shit was dripping atmosphere.  <br>Someone's going to make this his wallpaper, aren't they?</br>  <br>YEEART</br>  <br>Contrary to popular opinion, Ninja Slayer is not only silly ninja fun, but also one of the best cyberpunk settings of our times.</br>  <br><br>going to?</br></br>  <br>Ninja slayer is basically Trigger constantly teasing us that they can do fantastic things all the time if they really tried.</br>  <br> if they really tried <br>If they had a budget, really.</br></br>  <br>But they DO fantastic things</br>  <br>Goddamn,  C88  can't come soon enough.</br>  <br> Implying Ninja Slayer and Little Witch Academia aren't AOTY </br>  YEAART!  I want more Ninja Slayer everything. <br>So I pre-ordered both the US releases of Ninja Slayer, Part 1: Machine of Vengeance and Ninja Slayer Kills 1, but I literally have no idea what the difference is between them. Is one a manga and the other a novel? <br><br><br>Episode 7 ED for best ED and best episode<br><br> Fujikido meeting his father had no right to be as fucking good as it was. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I could die having lived a full life if pic related</br></br></br></br>  <br>They are two different manga series that cover different episodes. Machine of Vengeance is drawn by the Akumetsu guy, so it's a bit more violent and crazy, while the Kills guy is pretty new, so his style is a bit more constrained.</br>  Didn't even find this thread when posting the subs, heh. Late apology for being late with that, work.  <br>Yes. Watch from the beginning, you won't regret it.</br>  <br>Fuck you</br>    <br> Fujikido meeting his father had no right to be as fucking good as it was. <br>Wooooah woah wait up. That was his dad? This is the first I hear of this. I loved that part of the episode, but not I nor anybody else made the connection that it was his dad in the threads. What do you base that information on?</br></br>  <br> What do you base that information on? <br><br>Not being stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>Ninja Slayer really has the deepest dialogue</br>  <br>His ass, I assume. The son they discussed will appear in the later episodes.</br>    How come this shit didn't take off?  What do you mean? It was one of the most popular normalfag anime while it aired<br><br> le epic genius keikaku twins xD </br></br>  <br>Because Reddit liked it, and if Reddit likes something you're not allowed to like it or else you're a redditor.</br>   posting loli <br><br>Enjoy your ban.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127844444   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127844444 <br>Quints speak the truth.</br>  <br>Cat ears is monster girl enough for the furfag mod.</br>  Don't tell me NGNL is in the 'Season Two Never' category.  <br>I heard even the source material is having troubles</br>   LN adaptation about being stuck in another world <br>yawn. just the latest fad, there will be even more to take its place, no reason for this to require a S2.</br>  <br><br>Because it was drawn by a shitty Brazilian who traced art.</br></br>  In terms of game anime nothing comes even close, it's on another level tbh.<br><br>It's not cool because reddit likes it or w/e.</br></br>  because the story sucks  <br>It joins the ranks of deadman wonderland.</br>  <br><br>I watched it after it finished airing without having heard anything about it and only realized its popularity after i had finished. Because of this i feel my opinion is unbiased when i say it was EXTREMELY mediocre, the fan service was ridiculously excessive and the super genius MC's plans only worked in scenarios where the writer clearly wrote how they were going to win before actually planning the game/challenge. Le deux ex le machina anyone? It was relatively enjoyable but Im still baffled by its popularity</br></br>  <br>It's not, there's just not really enough material to adapt. Maybe some time next year.<br>It sold well and boosted the LN sales, and the author had a hand in the anime so it was a fair adaptation with decent pacing compared to most LN adaptations.</br></br>  <br>There isn't enough porn of Jibril</br>  <br><br>its also cause MAD HOUSE</br></br>  <br> How come this shit didn't take off? <br><br>Probably because NGNL was nothing but flangrant otaku pandering laced with loli fanservice and meritocratic video game playing.<br><br>And we here on /a/ are a bit too smart to be pandered to in that way.</br></br></br></br></br>  It'll probably have its second season once the author actually makes books 7-9 at the very least.  <br> And we here on /a/ are a bit too smart to be pandered to in that way <br>Don't get ahead of yourself there.</br></br>  <br>Because it's not that good</br>  <br>But wasn't the accusations of tracing almost a year ago? How as that not been settled yet?</br>  BR<br>Trace on<br>etc</br></br>  <br> And we here on /a/ are a bit too smart to be pandered to in that way. </br>  why the angel attack one at a time  <br>are you implying they are artificial?</br>  <br>But Angels aren't generated by Earths nature. Maybe their native nature wasn't the same nature as Earths nature.</br>  Because it's deep and profound that way.  <br>From what?</br>  <br>Because that's how they form.<br>It's some sort of prophecy thing or something like that and it has to do with some thing or something.</br></br>    How come some of his hair is white ?  <br>Why the sad face faggot<br><br>IT IS  HAPPENING </br></br></br>  <br>Berserk armor aged him. too much strain. drained his lifeforce.</br>  HOPE thread.  how long as it been since we got on this boat  <br>No sad faces anymore, babe.

And GODDAMN the art is just orgasmic</br>  A lot of the Berserk girls are pretty cute.<br><br>I wish I was a male living in the world, could get a cute wife in a medeival dress.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I agree.</br>  <br>no<br><br>she won't be retarded anymore, but she'll forget everything about guts</br></br></br>  FUCK OFF FEEL SHIT!<br/>  <br>Fuck I wanted to post this one.</br>  <br>It's edgy, but it does edginess extremely well, and it makes it work.</br>  <br> I wish I was a male living in the world <br> wants to live in Berserk World </br></br>  <br>Absolutely not because Guts isn't allowed to be happy.</br>  <br> I wish I was a male living in the world <br> actual wants to live in the world of Berserk <br>no girl is cute enough to make me want to do that<br><br> maybe </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Must suck being a girl in the berserk world. Just trying to do your day to day work and then suddenly you're almost raped by a horse.</br>  <br> almost </br>  <br>You know that you're gonna get killed and your cute wife is going to be raped by goons/demons/trolls etc.</br>  <br> not training with sword and combat <br><br>Fucking pleb.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah... I mean, there's regular "waaa my parents are dead" or "you don't understand my burden!" type of edgy...<br><br>and then there is "my lover was raped by demons, my best friend did it, all my friends were killed, and I lost my arm and eye to demons that now seem to keep following me to finish the job" sort of edgy.<br><br>Guts turned out alright. Honestly, it takes a bit of thought to come up with people who had it worse off than him.</br></br></br></br></br>   morons are actually shocked because a moron wishes that he could be in the Berserk universe <br>Wow, it's fucking nothing.</br>  <br>kill yourself avatarfag</br>  <br>Guts trained from the moment he could hold a sword and Casca still got raped. What makes you think you'll do any better?</br>  <br>I don't have the Brand</br>  <br>You'd probably die of the plague before you get it.</br>  <br>I want to be like rickert and learn blacksmithing with a badass old man and then marry his QT adopted daughter.</br>  <br>Rip in pieces Godo, only good dad on the whole story</br>  <br><br><br><br>What would happen... if all of 4chan was transported to a world like Berserk.<br><br>A world where thoughts shape the astral plane... what would be our  idea of evil? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Rate my sick tatt fags  <br>Seriously, Guts had a really hard life.<br><br> Born from a corpse <br> Gambino <br> Raped by a huge nigger, sold by Gambino <br> Escapes, fights against wolves <br> Gets a group in Golden Age <br> Everyone knows how this ended <br> The love of his life is retarded <br><br>Yet he doesn't give up, that's why Guts is so great, you can't just say that he's a bad character because of his edgyness, he actually has reasons to be like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Secondaries and normies. Every night we'd be haunted by them. <br> "The last good anime was cowboy bebooop" <br> "Do I watch fate/zero before watching UBW?" </br></br></br>  <br>You're fucking killing me, mate.</br>  <br>You can be in the Berserk universe in your dreams, you dumb boy.</br>  <br>Vargas was a good dad.</br>  <br>Nice cap.</br>  <br>It'd be better if it was much smaller and not colored. I like your hat though.</br>  <br>Would moot appear as our Skull Knight and save us from the reddit and tumblr eclipse?</br>  <br> Yet he doesn't give up, that's why Guts is so great, you can't just say that he's a bad character because of his edgyness, he actually has reasons to be like that. <br>Anon Guts has been into DeepShit no use giving up now. Too bad we'll never have a proper anime adaptation</br></br>  <br>Not the original guy, different guy.<br><br>Fuck actually being in the Berserk world. Just an interesting concept (where the minds of men shape the fabric underneath the world).<br><br>Berserk world just sucks because everyone seems to sub-consciously want to be punished. Makes sense though.<br><br>Only religion we really see is Catholicism.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>anon... moot died in the eclipse.</br>  <br>N-NEE-CHAN?</br>  <br>If you count ascending to demigod status as "dying" then sure. We're the ones who got the brand.</br>  <br> Too bad we'll never have a proper anime adaptation <br>I think the original, older adaptation was done really well. It was a fantastic dub for it's time.<br><br>It just wasn't a full adaptation, that's all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It captured the heart of the series even with the things it omitted. I just wish that it actually had Guts and Casca escape.</br>  <br>I've only read the manga. Spooky skellington wasn't there to save them?</br>  <br>Nope, Skill Knight was omitted. It fades to black when Guts loses his eye and then that's it.</br>  <br> Skill Knight <br>I like it.</br></br>  <br> I just wish that it actually had Guts and Casca escape <br>The ending is what made me read the manga. God was I fucking annoyed that it ended like that. Berserk is the only manga I've read aside from Vagabond, so I guess they accomplished the task of making watchers get hooked on the manga.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>no u</br>  Bumpu with waifu  Is the power of the Brand is just to draw demons towards you and pains you when they're close and by their powerlevel?  i hate isidro<br><br>what a pointless fucking character</br></br>  <br>I like him. You can also really tell how much he's grown and matured, which is cool.</br>  <br>You could say that about most of Guts' JRPG party</br>  <br>I like him because he along with Puck bring life to Guts' JRPG party.</br>  <br>It's just jarring that he makes it through everything unscathed after the countless deaths of trained and experienced soldiers we've seen.</br>  <br>You're fat but it's a good tattoo.</br>  Meanwhile at the Togashi household. <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=l8N<wbr>2YSGjXXM</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Guts is too hardcore for its own good  <br>magic, i aint gotta explain shit</br>  <br>that cgi is so SHIIIT</br>  <br>get rid of the red and ur good</br>  <br>so berserkfags are normalfags casuals</br>  <br>It's a gateway manga after all.</br>  <br>Having the brand essentially labels you as Griffith's bitch.</br>  <br><br>nice funposting</br></br>  <br>https://www.reddit.com/user/Armando<wbr>909396<br>Here's his reddit account if anyone's interested.</br></wbr></br>  <br>Reminder that Miss Luca is best girl</br>    <br>She is the best character in Berserk.

She really enjoyed these threads. I don't care if she was a massive shitposter, I just want her to have fun and enjoy herself. </br></br></br>  <br> Concept of ugly being relevant when you're Gutts </br>  <br>I really really hate her enablers. Only /a/ has this pathetic tripshit worship mentality and all because she's a girl. A legit insane girl. That noname nigger is probably next.<br><br>This is your fault</br></br></br>  <br>As their sissy boy rape slaves.</br>    <br>It is my fault. I don't have any regrets.</br>   literal retards are sucking the dick of a literally retarded random irrelevant shitposter when he's not even here again <br>What a surprise.</br>  <br>What would you do if your doctor told you you had cancer? You'd cut that shit out without a moments hesitation.<br><br>What if he said it has a spinal cord and brain tissue? You take that fucker out by it's vestigial legs and throw it into the furnace. Cancer is cancer. Its probably better for it</br></br></br>  <br>Consider suicide and take that cunt with you</br>  <br> I don't care if she was a massive shitposter, I just want her to have fun and enjoy herself. <br> fuck 3dpd and tripfags man! <br> trip revealed to be a girl <br> c-can I be your friend? I don't care that you are a shitposter <br><br>Good job /a/. You have a cult following a Griffith obsessed girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  whats all this talk about an insane female on /a/  which as we known is the norm just look at /cgl/ and /soc/    <br>Berserk threads have been garbage for about a year now thanks to a mentally ill woman</br>  Post predictions for the next chapter.  <br>whats the trip i'm sure ill find shit on foolz or etc cat</br>  <br>It's because literally retarded ugly permavirgins like you think that girls browse and shitpost in /a/.</br>  Is it worth investing in all 37 volumes or Berserk?  <br>She's legit crazy, unironically believing that Griffith did nothing wrong and drags the entire thread down the shitter defending him.</br>  <br>Yes, of course<br>It's a piece of art, and do you not want to support Miura? <br><br> inb4 shilling  <br>I bought them all as well since it's a really great manga series featuring superb artwork</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>if you can find them cheap</br></br>  <br> someone didn't get the joke or is trying to bate me </br>  <br>You didn't say a joke, you moron.</br>  <br>If you have the money and like it yeah.<br>I wouldn't buy them without reading them first though, at least read some volumes online to see if you like it.</br></br>  <br> What would you do if your doctor told you you had cancer? <br>Hawk isn't a cancer<br><br>no<br><br> shitposting is a problem <br> what should I do? <br> oh I know, I'll shitpost some more <br>That's you. If anyone breaks the rules, posts off topic, there is the report button, learn how to use it instead of pointlessly pissing in the sea<br><br>And look at you, you fucking faggot. What does monogatari have to do with Berserk? Fucking nothing, that's what. Last time I checked avatarfagging is against the rules but tripping was not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Fine berserker thread turned into ship because of cheap internet fights <br>Fuck off faggots, I hope Griffith does an eclipse right in your fucking asses.</br>  <br>Me too, then hawk would totally be jealous of me and make me tell her all about it.</br>  <br>what the fuck does you responding to every single person in this thread have to do with berserk?<br><br>just piss off</br></br></br>  <br><br>Implying a 6' 3'' guy who is as muscular and sociopathic as guts does not get more pussy than any of us ever will.</br></br>  so who is hyped for elf island and all its old school sage shit and magic we've been teased for YEARS about this do you think gutts and crew will go ssj4 are we finally going to see some god hands die?<br><br>also inb4 google is failing me whats this persons trip</br></br>  <br>Absolutely nothing, which absolutely no one needed to point out you fuckin' moron. But well done. You contributed more shitposting.<br><br>Well fucking done. You could have just done the right thing, you could have ignored and reported the shitposting. But no, you're too fucking good for that. You think your voice needs to be heard when you really just need to be quiet.<br><br>When our guard is down, I think we'll both agree<br>Shitposting breeds shitposting<br><br>BUT IN THE END IT HAS TO BE THIS WAY</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Am I the only one who wants Guts to succumb to Slan and fuck her real good?  Then kill her   <br><br>It'd be cool, however it seems thar the four can't actually be killled.</br></br>   My whole life was Unlimited Blade Works <br>Wow, fucking really ufotable?</br>  That was in the VN too, now stop making obvious troll threads.  <br>You've only watched the DEEN anime and Fate/Zero, right?</br>          <br>We need one of those for Shirou's UBW.</br>    <br> Now you've done it! You've become a Puella Magi, Madoka Magica! <br>Dropped instantly, I can't believe people call this a masterpiece.</br></br>  <br>I like this one.</br>  Is there an Angry Manjew evilness mental breakdown bait?   /v/tards bringing in their shitty may mays   My whole life was Unlimited Rin Works  <br>I thought this is /tv/ meme?</br>  <br> not seven proxies </br>   My whole life was overrated shit with a circle-jerking fanbase  <br>Sounds about right.</br>  <br>It is. Everyone steals from /tv/.</br>  "My name is Charlotte"<br><br>Bravo PA Works</br></br>  <br>Fuck off with your shit OP</br>  <br> circle-jerking fanbase  <br>Hilarious coming from a puppet repeating maymays in order to try and fit in, go and kill thyself you dumb loser.</br></br>  <br>That's shit. Here, have a better one.</br>  <br>That IS for Shirou.</br>  <br>No, this is Archer's chant.</br>  <br>I am the bone of my bait <br>Bait is my body and bait is my blood <br>I have created over a thousand baits<br>Unaware of mods, nor aware of discussion<br>Withstood pain to create baits, waiting for OP to deliver <br>I have no regrets. This is the only path<br>My whole life was Unlimited Bait Works.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yet the image is of Shirou. Maybe that's the bait.</br>     So you won't talk huh? Looks like I'll have to Kill la Kill you! <br><br>Seriously trigger?</br></br>  Someone should do fall semester mike to read "did you mean bait?"    <br>That line wasn't in UFO's adaptation.</br>  <br>I am the Bane of Gotham.<br>Darkness is my body and fire is my blood. <br>I have crashed over a thousand planes, <br>Unknown to CIA, nor known to Batman. <br>Have withstood pain to take many masks off <br>Yet, this crash will never have any survivors.<br>So, as I pray, unlimited Bane works.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>     My whole life was the infinte creation of swords. <br>I'M GONNA KILL YOU CRUNCHYROLL</br>  <br>Yes it was, Crunchymongrel.</br>  <br>I guess that True Assassin&amp;Berserker are the only ones without their own b8image.</br>  <br>It wasn't. He explicitly refers to his body being made of infinite swords in that scene.</br>  <br>Why does he look so innocent and not like a crazy sociopath in this image?</br>  My whole life was /a/   We finally did it Asuka... We finally reached the end... of Evangelion <br>I can't believe I sat through 26 episodes of this shit</br>  <br>Not to mention<br> I've got to find out who Kill La Killed my dad </br></br>    <br/>  <br>Nice work OP, all those great fate related bait pictures.<br><br>Bait Stay Out</br></br></br>  <br>At first I felt bad for making such a shitty thread, but it's summer and I thought "why the fuck not?". I definitely don't regret it.</br>  <br>The term "無限の剣製" is used in both the VN and the anime. The most literal translation for this is "infinite creation of swords", but the official romanization is "Unlimited Blade Works" (アンリミテッドブレイドワークス).<br>More over, some of the promo material literally quotes "...I have no regrets. This is the only path/ My whole life was Unlimited Blade Works"<br><br>Seriously, fuck off Crunchymongrel secondary.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Aniplex typically puts out a crude sub script for the initial broadcast and then revise it after the fact. Also, a more professional script is usually used for the BD release.</br>  <br>Why does he look so innocent and not like a  fancy gentleman  in this image?</br>  <br>“Their lines may cut, but the fish still see my bait! These men are my fishing buddies – my loyal fishermen! They’re my true friends - breaking the rules of 4chan and /a/ to fish once more at my side!”<br><br>“They are my worms on hooks; they’re my right to bait! They make up Anon's most triggering bait – Ionian Baitroi!!”</br></br></br>  <br>12 baiters and tsubame kouji</br>    <br>wait, fake assassin has one?</br>  I need Bait of Honer.<br> everything you touch turns to bait </br>  <br> The term "無限の剣製" is used in both the VN and the anime <br>That's not the line he uses. The anime and VN use この体は、無限の剣で出来ていた which doesn't translate to "my whole life was unlimited blade works." It's no wonder the FSN translation gets shat on so much. Crunchy roll did people a favor using a more proper translation as opposed to using the garbage Takajun shat out.</br></br>  <br>Not 100% sure but I remember seeing one with him.</br>    Papa Bones welcomes you to his thread.<br><br>Momon and Narbel next episode. Will the Albedo vs Narbel for best waifu commence?</br></br>  <br> Shalltear best girl  No contest.</br>  <br>Narbel is just a maid.

It's a very manly chin.</br>  <br> Will the Albedo vs Narbel for best waifu commence? <br>No because all girls in Nazarick are daughteru-zoned. Best girl battle is the right battle to commence, not best waifu.</br></br>  <br>How does she even lose them?</br>  <br>If anything, they will fight over who the legal wife would be. The rest would be concubines.</br>  <br>They wish for that but  Papa Bones already daughter zoned everyone by public declaration . Poor  Aura too finally thought she had a chance .

Look it up. It's bretty good.</br>  <br>That's what he thought at first as well.  But he's kinda like Rou and he eats the last boss right at the start. So now he keeps having encounters where people think he's just a slime but well you know. </br>  <br>At least you can makes them girls oragism as a slime</br>  <br> oragism <br><br>That sounds painful.</br></br></br>  <br>I've no time for moon. Is it translated somewhere?</br>  <br><br><br>Shit taste shit taste shit taste. MOVE Best girl coming through</br></br></br>  <br>There's translated manga, LN and WN out there. Not a lot but enough to get you started. Google it.</br>  <br>3 manga chapters, around 17 or so LN chapters, 33 WN chapters if you're going for translated. WN gets updated 1-2 chapters per day.<br><br>It's the complete opposite of Overlord though. It's really comfy. Mainly because he's a slime.</br></br></br>  So does he stay as skeletor for the whole thing?  <br>Yes. He disguises himself as a human, but it's a flimsy glamour spell.</br>   Beautiful girls around you <br> No penis <br>That a really  Humerus  situation</br></br>  <br>Shut up, Carlos.</br>  <br>why does this worry me so much<br> could I be an illusion of the skeleton inside me? <br> could you? </br></br></br>  <br>you think he can carry out Descartes will as an illusion?</br>  can someone give me a summary of the general idea of the endgame here with as few spoilers as possible? whether or not I stick with this depends entirely on it's plot direction. I can already tell it's probably not going to be some SoL shit where they just chill in their dungeon, which is good, but what's the basic overarching idea of this story?    <br>How can there be end game when the LN and even WN have not ended yet?</br>  <br>Land Fall best girl then? Or maybe Certain Death?</br>  <br>No silly, it goes like this.<br> Skeletons are mobile and reclusive beings of extreme intellect. Unfortunately they must sleep or long periods of time. As such they end up staying still for an amazing amount of time. As they sit still a sort of fungus or moss can grow on them. This is known as flesh. If left untreated the sleeping skeleton will be more or less hijacked to be the backbone of another being in their sleep. Luckily, these odd beings die before the skeleton has time to wake up, making it harmless. </br></br>    So what happens to his real world body? Is he dead or did he just vanish?  <br> mfw this question again for the 834th time </br>  <br>Probably the former.</br>  <br>I would assume it's either just sitting there or it went fucking braindead.<br>Haven't read the LN so I dunno if they address it.</br></br>  <br>No end game known.<br>MC wants:<br> More information about the world and potential threats so he can keep the creations of his friends safe. <br>The Guardians want:<br> To take over the world and offer it up to Momonga as a jewel befitting their supreme master. <br><br>There's a lot of subtle movement towards both objectives. The season will probably end in...<br> One of the Guardians' loyalty being mind controlled out of them by a third party who uses a World Class item, leaving MC Spooky to duel with them. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A skeleton just wants to protect NPCs destined by his former guildmates since he sees them as their children. They think of him as this scary overlord and he does his best to keep up that persona. Misunderstandings and other shenanigans ensue and now the NPCs think he wants to take over the world. So he complies because he doesn't to ruin the image they have if him.</br>  Why doesn't he just marry Albedo the slut and live happily ever after?  I think it's interesting that the lich is the cutest of them all. NEET4LYFE  <br>Considering he can feel pain from a strong enough attack in this world, and by the assumption that any sane fucking DMMORPG won't carry over the sense of being stabbed in the stomach, EVERYTHING was brought into the new world, not just his dmmo "mind".</br>  <br>He's a skeleton anon, he doesn't have a boner that isn't made out of calcium.</br>  <br>Because it's all virtual and it probably freaks him out a bit.<br>Also he has a big ass staff of killing everything, might as well use it to do things.</br></br>  <br> NEET <br>But he isn't</br></br>  <br>see </br>  <br>His a spooky skeleton how does that even work?</br>  <br>Probably a mind split since the game tapped into his consciousness in the first place. Part of him got kicked off the server as normal and carried out his mundane life, none the wiser, and the part of him with the lingering attachment to the game stayed in the game world.</br>  <br>Not meet brah.

A big step for him in the right direction I think. One of the reasons I'm glad Albedo is there.</br>  <br>SO IS THIS THE NEW FACE FOR WHEN THE RIDE NEVER ENDS FOR ANIME?</br>  <br><br>  no, they used the item on Shalltear and then escaped the area, thus leaving Shalltear in some sort of defense mode. She basically is in Area Defense and Seek and Destroy mode  </br></br>    <br>Wrong, Shalltear kills the old woman wearing the qipao mind control item before she goes under full control.<br>That's why she's on standby, because the controller was killed before giving a command.</br></br>  <br>He probably chose the slime race because of some min maxy fucktard reason.</br>  <br>oh really?<br><br>Then I have to reread. I thought she was stopped right at that moment and the group decided rather to bail, because they didn't know if they could fully control her</br></br></br>  <br> oragism <br>It's unfortunate, but I've never once oragismed.</br></br>  <br>Very last section of part 2 volume 2.</br>  <br>Wrong. The old woman isn't dead yet, but she can't heal because Shalltear's spell was enhanced with healing prevention so the granny is in a coma basically and the Theocracy has no idea what to do.</br>  <br>So will he ever give Albedo the bone?<br><br>Can he even bone?</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly, that slime probably looked majestic as fuck when it wore equipment.<br>It can only be assumed that he gave it all to Ainz for the memorial golem that Ainz made for the guild members.</br></br>  <br>She didn't die but the Purifying Javelin killed her bodyguard and gored her so badly that she barely lived and they couldn't heal her at the spot (since the corruption from her purifying javelin blocked all low tier healing spells, they would need ritual level group magic for it but they have no way of knowing this).<br><br>And then another goon of theirs tried to attack the immobile Shalltear and got instantly killed so they decided to grab the dead shield &amp; chain user and haul ass back to theocracy so they could do ritual resurrections for those two and healing for granny.<br><br>No idea if the item itself survived the onslaught.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I was told it was confirmed only two people died to Shalltear. One was the shield guy hit by the spell. The second was killed when he triggered her defensive actions on accident. The woman with the dress was confirmed to have unhealable wounds but wasn't dead. Should be from the interlude with the woman with two hair colors talking with the one Theocracy guy. </br>  <br>End result is still the same, though.</br>  <br> No penis <br>Then give her the bone<br> Yohohohoho... </br></br></br>  <br><br>My mistake then.<br>Chapters that focus on the kingdoms and politics don't stick with me very strongly.</br></br></br>  <br>And they tend to get quite little pagetime per chapter, often going full volumes before we hear more about kingdom/theocracy/empire.</br>  <br> Give her the Pike </br>  <br>It's not. Dead means she gets revived and loses levels.</br>  <br>I'd say politics is the endgame here. Slowly but surely he'll go towards world domination either through conquest or bribery. As far as the LN has been translated he's still searching for information but is also building a power base outside of his tomb. From what I've heard the WN was more into politics but it was toned down in the LN.</br>    <br> Not sure her levels really matter though. The only thing that makes her dangerous in the first place is her world class item. Barring that no one in her group poses in real threat probably. </br>  <br>She can't bluff that they're real anymore since everyone saw her without em.</br>  Anybody got the mega link for the novels?  <br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA</wbr></br>  <br/>  <br>https://drive.google.com/folderview<wbr>?id=0ByPeaKaqUsGFQVAxUEM2bUI0R0E<br>Just fucking use google you autist</br></wbr></br>  <br>gdocs that's out of date and behind releases by 2 months, well thought but you could do better.</br>  <br>Certain errors are outdated there.</br>  So how many of his friends are in the new world?

He was beating her because she couldn't read him. Or is this later?  </br>  <br>Nothing you said has absolutely anything to do with my point. If anything my post actually conveniently gets around yours, because you can shift blame onto the alt who no one can prove is yours of related to you. All you have to do is say you sold it or traded it. Who the fuck has tabs on all 200 WC items at all times? Impossible. All it takes is one person to have gotten a WC item and never log on again to take it completely out of the game.<br><br>The crux of the issue is whether or not the game has requirements for items. We already know the WC armor needs the WC class to use it. It's not impossible for lowbies to be unable to hold onto divine class items and such and is easily explained by the power coursing through it being too much for their bodies.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. There are sword skills that lets you deflect any sword attack for example.</br>  <br>At no point does Clementine have a problem with Ainz's pattern of attacks, otherwise she would have died. That she can avoid taking any damage the whole fight until she gambles all-in despite being like 50 levels lower is a testament to how shitty Ainz's melee is.</br>  <br>It stops him from doing anything to someone of comparable strength when it comes to swordplay.<br><br>It's only "broken" because everyone else outside of the Tomb (for the most part) is garbage.<br><br>It's like if you were a mage in an MMO and just went around auto attacking level 5 wolves with your staff one shotting them. That seems OP as shit only because you're at the point where your weakest possible attack decimates them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We don't know that. It might have an upper limit that just wasn't reached in that fight.</br>  <br>I'm talking about crazy   yeah Ainz would have won but more out of luck and outlasting her since he was incapable of scoring a hit  <br><br><br>Yeah there were a lot of world items but the 20 are the ones that were really broken the rest were just really powerful items and yes everyone knew who had the 20 at all times because that shit was beyond broken</br></br></br></br>  <br>It'd still have to be a really fucking high limit, even if Ainz is a Mage, he was using Warrior equipment which would boost his melee stats; and he is a level 100 (so probably ~50 levels higher than her). <br><br>Honestly, if she was a level 100 too, she could probably nullify most attacks from a level 100 melee (with probably the exceptions of bullshit attacks like the Dimension Cutter and World Break).</br></br></br>  Friendly reminder that if you were expecting cute girls you are in for a rough surprise.  <br><br>I don't deny that Shalltear is a counter to magic caster in general, but isn't she an extreme pain in the ass for death magic user? Especially an undead magic caster.<br><br> her gears have anti instant death attributes <br> can summon an exact copy of herself with the same gears <br> is an undead who heals from lethal spells / negative energy <br> One of her jobs is fucking cleric <br> possesses several spells with holy attributes and a spell which deals fire damage, which is one of the undead's weakness <br> Spuit Lance - A divine item with life-leech properties. Deals crush damage, which has increased effects against undead. <br><br>It's like Peroroncino created her to fuck with Momonga on purpose.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ghost <br> Top Hat <br> Flight and Magnetic Bones <br> Spooky Tomb, I'm a Ghost after all <br> Eric Von Skullkill <br><br>This fuddy duddy Skullkill will never see through my Top Hat disguise!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is every fantasy a self insert satire? How did we go from Berserk and Slayers to this?  <br>2 points of contention<br><br>first Ainz was wearing items created by spells<br><br>second Martial abilities from new world != martial abilities from the game and are in fact way more diverse.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The 20 are only the 20 because they are the ones known. Unless you know all 200, how can you claim there are only 20 in that class? Information isn't free in Yggdrasil, and the devs don't spoonfeed. More importantly whose to say all the abilities of a '20' were leaked out? It could just be a vague understanding.<br><br>And you are still ignoring my point of item requirements, it's getting really stupid so either get back on track or don't bother. Arguing about WC items has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not stats matter for equipping items.</br></br></br>  <br>This isn't satire. The only satirical bit I can think of is hamster lord.</br>  <br> At no point does Clementine have a problem with Ainz's pattern of attacks, <br>Don't blatantly lie to me, anon. It's what pushed her on the defensive until she utilised her martial arts, the fact that she couldn't read him. It forced her to go sanic fast so that even if she couldn't read him, she was still fast enough to dodge anyway.</br></br>  <br>Actually being undead was the one thing Ainz had going for him since being a skellington he fucked with her ability to steal life with anything except her weapon and the instant death stuff is standard for everyone (and the reason why Ainz's build is kind of shit)</br>  <br>People stopped wanting boats and shitty endings. Slayers humor is also outdated decades ago and even teenagers today don't find it all that funny.</br>  <br>It has all the hallmarks of escapist fantasy. MC is transported to another world and he happens to be the fucking shit.<br><br>I want them to make a series where a Japanese schoolboy comes to a fantasy world and then gets his fucking head chopped off in the middle of a skirmish</br></br></br>  <br>Go watch Rokka Yuusha.</br>  <br>Momo is immune to fire...</br>    <br>That looks like a cute girl. Is it a trap?</br>  <br>That means she had no problem. If Ainz wasn't invincible to her attacks he would have died within the first 3 bouts at most. Every attack that even came close to killing her was a result of her having to overextend herself in order to deal damage to him.<br><br>If she just wanted to survive and had no desire to kill Ainz then unless Ainz used magic she would easily get away or even if not running away she could dance laps around him for a good hour or so which for all intents and purposes, means you have no problem.<br><br>Don't be retarded and go nitpicking you would know exactly what context I'm talking about if you used your brain for 5 seconds.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll concede that her build does make it look like she was designed to screw with Ainz. However, considering that he only noticed now that she had a resurrection item, I don't think that Peroroncino ever ordered Shalltear to attack him.<br><br>Also,<br><br> her gears have anti instant death attributes <br>You'd be pretty dumb as a high level player to not have instant death immunity.<br><br> can summon an exact copy of herself with the same gears <br>Proves nothing<br><br> undead who heals from negative energy <br> cleric class <br>Just means that she can deal with both good and evil players<br><br> Spuit lance <br>She's a vampire. Life-leech is in-character for her. The crush damage seems to be an added bonus more than anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mushoku Tensei already did that edgelord. </br>  <br>But he is invincible, so it's a moot point. Who cares about sword skill when the MC can power through it?</br>  <br>best semen demon</br>  <br>The fact is Ainz has over 700 spells at his disposal, I doubt they are all death based.</br>  <br>That's why people liked Mushoku Tensei a lot. It starts off as a self insert but the characters evolve so much that they become their own beings which you build connections with.<br><br>The lows and trauma that happen to the characters are completely appropriate and don't seemed shoehorned in just for the sake of having them.<br><br>Overlord has also dipped into this with Shalltear's possession and Bone's loneliness, but there always seems to be a giant safety net that makes it seem that everything will always go right for Nazarick. Maybe this is why the author focuses on developing backstories and characterization to side characters, they're the ones that experience the lows.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>First up, you sound salty as fuck nigger, tone it down. Secondly, you're not exactly winning if your opponent is forcing you into the defensive because you can't read/predict his movements. Yes that changed once she started using her skills, but as a baseline, Ainz was fine. He probably could have killed her as a swordsman perfectly fine, it would have just taken longer. He's like an invincible RNG. One of them will hit eventually. He didn't have to drop the swordsman act.</br>  <br>Escaflowne, but it's a Japanese schoolgirl.<br><br>She is literally shit in every regard except for being a testostorone boost for the main male character.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No, just a cute magical girl.</br></br>  <br>You don't need to order your servant to attack another in order to design that servant as a counter. That's just piss poor logic that stems from your weird misconception that Peroroncino made Shalltear like that to attack Ainz in malice and not just a design based on trolling Ainz for the lulz if he ever felt like it.<br><br>Next you're gonna tell me Nigrudo was made for Tabula's grand betrayal where he uses her as a distraction as he emptys out the treasury. Paranoid much?</br></br></br>  <br> implying she need to hit him to leech HP <br>Hitting her own summons is even more effective, which is legitimately a counter measure against Momonga.<br><br> The healing ability of the Spuit Lance, needless to say, depended on the amount of damage inflicted. Ainz, who was the same level with high defense, versus her weak kin. There was no need to state which side would give more health. Reflected in Ainz’ vision in real time was the image of Shalltear restoring great amounts of her health. </br></br></br></br>  <br> Fireball <br> Lightning <br> Time stop <br> Black hole <br> Hell fire <br> Sharknado <br> Reality slash </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Now that the Npc's are daughter zoned that means best girl is the obvious choice for papa bones!<br><br>Even better if he trains her up to level 100 so we can have cute undead training moments.</br></br>  <br>To be fair, the one time she did something she literally fucked over the whole plot.<br> destiny manipulation </br></br>  <br>The thing is stealing off her minions didn't exist in the game, it's a countermeasure she came up with in the new world by herself and can't be used for the stupid designed to beat momo argument</br>  If she got killed in a Raid could she really beat Momo?  <br>With what you pointed out and the fact that Tabula gave Albedo a world class item without Momon's knowledge. It almost seems like there were some guild members who were looking to cause trouble. Not that I have any hard evidence to validate that. I mean this was a guild in what was an MMO, I haven't come across many guilds that didn't have some form of drama in their history.</br>  <br> I don't think that Peroroncino ever ordered Shalltear to attack him. <br>Me neither, but don't tell me you never troll or fuck around with your gaming buddy?</br></br>  <br> anti instant death attributes <br>Literally everyone uses those. In a game where you can be one-shotted by a level 1 scrub unless you use equipment that nullifies or at least resists Instant Death; are you really going to tell me you wouldn't wear equipment to resist Instant Death effects?<br> can summon an exact copy of herself with the same gears <br>Don't see how this is specifically a counter to a death mage.<br> is an undead who heals from lethal spells / negative energy <br>Floors 1-3 are Catacombs; it'd be more shocking if the Guardian WASN'T an Undead.<br> One of her jobs is fucking cleric <br>You realize that in almost every MMO ever, melee classes that can heal themselves are ridiculously OP right? In an MMO where you can pick multiple classes, it'd be more shocking for a melee character to NOT to have Cleric as one of their sub-classes.<br> possesses several spells with holy attributes and a spell which deals fire damage, which is one of the undead's weakness <br>If it works anything like modern MMOs, those most likely came with the Cleric class to be honest.<br> Spuit Lance - A divine item with life-leech properties. Deals crush damage, which has increased effects against undead. <br>This is actually pretty shitty against Undead since the entire point of the Lance is self-sustain with that life-leech; but it doesn't work against Undead. If she really designed specifically to counter Ainz (which is a really fucking stupid idea that one autist insists on bringing up every single thread for the last couple of weeks), her creator would have given her something like a Holy/Fire Hammer for both Crush damage and elemental weakness.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or she was designed to be tanky as fuck, and the self regen item was used to add extra defense. I mean she was designed to be the first line of defense of the tomb where she was essentially fighting a fresh raid team.</br>  What was with the shitty fps on some of the scenes in the first episode?  <br>You're shitposting now and you know it. Thanks for admitting you're just trying to get some attention.<br><br><br>We're talking about Clementine stop sticking your nose in when you can't even read properly.<br><br><br>Being perfectly adept at defense has no bearing at being utterly incapable at offense. That you don't understand such a basic concept and only give a shit about the end result makes you no different than Narberal who actually thought Ainz was a good swordsman, just that since you read the LN you were spoonfed that he isn't so you wouldn't make the same mistake.<br><br>That you also ignored all my other points that give context and weight to my post in favor of bulldozing his way to victory tells me you already forgot how paranoid and cautious Ainz is as well as how he isn't a retard like you who would waste time for no reason, nor is he full of hubris just for having higher stats.<br><br>Good job, you get a free trip called Iguva=41. You earned it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Funishit being incompetent.</br>  <br>Which is something I've always wondered.<br>So many cash items or world class items or just plain death have experience costs. Ainz is max level and has probably lost a one or two from using the wish ring or whatever the hell else he's used.<br><br>How can he get that back in this world? He'd have to farm his own top level summons which are level ~95 and have a limit of like 3 a day per summon. That shit would take forever.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>  he wasn't beating her at all. he couldnt even fucking hit her..he literally got bored and just hugged her to death </br></br>  <br>Farming XP by wiping out entire armies and cities.</br>  <br>Question for LNfags, the magic happend or he still in a crazy coma?</br>  <br>Ainz build is about the only one that can use Insta-death because of the eclipse Class, but even then with all the rez spells out there it's still kind of bad.</br>  <br>That'd be the same as that southpark episode where they farmed at the beginner zone until max level.</br>  Why is the OP so good?  Which floor do you think would be the worst to fight as a solo/party?<br><br>I would think that it'd be Cocytus's floor.<br><br> Floor buff to boss <br> Literally entering a frozen zone right after going through a lake <br> Continual frost damage <br> Attack speed down <br> Walk speed down <br> Reduced agility and dodge chance <br> For every attack you do, he attacks four times </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're taking into account outside factors. Papa Bones is a busy man, he's got shit to do, and his servant was getting the shit kicked out of her, he had to release her handicap and finish shit, pack up and go home. You put them both in a controlled room with all the time in the world to duke it out, and Ainz would have won hands down, it was only a matter of time until she slipped up and Ainz has infinite stamina. I stand by what I said. As a swordsman, ainz could have won. I never said he was a better swordsman than her, but by stint of his nature, he still would have won. It would have just taken some time. She couldn't deal with his random unprofessional movements. It's like giving a baby the strength and agility to wield dragonslayer. the reason swordsmen can beat eachother is because of training, one person has had better training than the other and can read their moves better. Training goes out the window when you fight what is effectively a wild beast. You gonna riposte a bear? He would have beat her easy without having to drop the swordsman act.</br></br>  <br>This is the world that will always be. No mention of his real body at all if it even exists anymore.</br>  <br>that could explain albedo wanting to kill the supreme beings</br>  <br>the labyrinth with the almost lesser key of Solomon boss fight. those 63 golems are build to takeout 2 full parties.</br>  <br>Third floor if your party members are scrubs.<br> Actually doing a decent job of soloing Shalltear <br> Scrub teammates try to jump and die instantly, also healing her back to full HP. </br></br></br>  <br>Not unless he's decked in fire resist gear and fucked his other resistances.<br>That's why the fight with Shalltear was pretty badass, he took on a high tier fire magic without showing any pain but subtlety winced when hit with holy. A trick to make all subsequent attacks against him holy because he was actually decked in holy resist gear with little to no fire resist.</br></br>  Would you pat her head, /a/?  <br>Only if she would stroke my cock</br>  I can't wait for him to fail to return in time and leave her waiting for seven hundred years.

Zero?   <br>who know.</br>  <br>The options are<br><br>1) he fucks up somehow and misses it despite Kirie allowing him time to train<br>2) Kitty isn't there, she forgot about her promise after 300 years of hardship<br>3) Kitty is now Evangeline, the dark mage and no longer wants to be Touta's friend- how this would play out I don't know, maybe she attacks him out of spite<br><br>It being a happy meeting seems impossible, that would be too easy for the plot and we need Touta's motivation to find out what happened to Evangeline during those long centuries and make her happy, since it is pretty much his fault she fell in love with Nagi- a man she could never have</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>perhaps She isn´t so bad and rumors about her it is exaggerated</br>  I think Eva will do a pactio with him.<br><br>She knows he wants to get stronger</br></br>  <br> 1 <br>He's an idiot so it's possible<br> 2 <br>Not gonna happen.<br> 3 <br>Eh, not sure if I want that route with dark Evangeline.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why did you let her suffer, Touta?  <br>kirie wants to be the only loli in tota's life</br>  <br> He's an idiot so it's possible <br><br>Personally I think 2 and 3 are more likely, 3 especially<br><br>Touta is a moron, but now that he knows the kind of time difference between the two of them and the odds he's playing with he has a real goal instead of "I want to be strong and beat this strong guy up". Motivation helps, and having number 3 happen (since he only knows Kitty and Yukihime, he has no idea about Evangeline the dark mage) would motivate him further onto a real goal like fixing Evangeline's never-ending loneliness in the universe</br></br></br></br></br>  This is a guess but. (idea, followed by reason, followed by potential holes in reasoning)<br>During that time period she's mentioning? Is pretty much when she meets Nagi. So there is no telling she'll be able to make it either.. Considering that she gets swept up in a lot of insanity and eventually locked into mahora.<br>I think so at least.. She's 500-700years old supposidly. The witch did not find her directly after she was transformed/created. Then we don't know how long she was being forcably trained before meeting tota. (but we know it has to have been a lot because she did not have the "head start" power up Tota does, but is clearly of similiar if not higher strength. Presumably this was around when she made the darkness curse thingy that Tota and Negi use as well. (during the training, finishing , or during that 200-300years span she met tota)<br><br>Of ocurse she did talk about being a 66 year old crone. I'm unsure if she's talking about since her original birth or not. But if she did then the time table doesn't remotely line up (She doesn't meet Nagi till around 500-600years old). But at the same time she got some insane power ups during that time period.<br><br>I do think tota will miss it, regardless of what point in life it is. Because of how she acted when she met Nagi. The ultra lonely, can't stand the lonliness thing.. If she had waited thatl ong for tota. (hell even if she met him,) being alone with only one true friend you only meet every hudnreds of years.. That'll wear on you.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's funny because mentally neither Kirie or Eva are actually lolis, while Ikkuu is actually a shota<br><br>UQ Holder, where girls are reverse traps, boys are traps, lolis are hags and grown men are little boys</br></br></br>  <br>Fund this please.

I hope they will use resets to allow everyone to read their books, or the first-come-first-served is a bluff.<br><br>Okay, so, here is the translation of the Chinese timeline. It seems to be an unofficial one placing Eva’s age at exactly 700 and working backwards from there.<br><br>1386 (0 years old) – Eva born<br><br>1396 (10 years old) – Eva’s tenth birthday, was transformed into a vampire by magic<br><br>1402 (16 years?) – has been caught by Dana and brought into the Rift castle under house arrest<br><br>– (N days) Meets Touta for the first time, Eva lets Touta see her attempt to kill the sleeping Dana<br><br>– (N days) Meets Touta a second time, drinks her fill of Touta’s blood<br><br>– (N days) Meets Touta the third time, explains the purpose of his internal training [magic duality]<br><br>– (N days) Meets Touta the fourth time, shows him a street performance, helps him train<br><br>– (N days) Meets Touta the fifth time, he peers into her past memories as she sleeps, Touta confesses<br><br>1404 (18 years?) – (2 years) Meets Touta the sixth time, Eva puppeteers dolls for Touta to spar with, wants to say farewell but her time is up<br><br>1412 (26 years?) – (8 years) Meets Touta the seventh time, Eva prepares afternoon tea, lets Touta stroke her head in farewell<br><br>[[1452 (66 years old confirmed in manga) — doesn’t manage to see Touta]]<br><br>1492 (106 years old) – Eva takes Karin away from her village [I guess she gets let out occasionally?]<br><br>[[1739 (353 years old) – probably manages to see Touta after his find the box test?]]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But you gotta give Akamatsu credit<br>He turned Touta from a shitty protag from a character with a well made background</br></br>  <br> a retard shounen protagonist <br>had no interest in fighting.<br>reads book is interested in many things.<br>Face it the only thing what seems to make him<br>a a retard shounen protagonist was his carefreeness.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He's an idiot so it's possible <br>he is not a idiot.just a simple 14 year old from the country.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it was planned<br><br>Even in the earliest chapters Touta strangely couldn't use magic despite being of the Springfield family, then he revealed Magia Erebea and now we know he has Magic Cancel also- essentially it's like the thing where Ichigo from Bleach is "half-human half-quincy half-hollow half-shinigami"- but where all of those were tacked on as Kubo needed, Touta started out with all of these retarded powers clusterfucked into him and it turns out that creating a Frankenstein-Werewolf-Mummy doesn't actually work as well in reality as you though it did in your head. Touta required real training to harness the conflicting elements of his powers, he couldn't just bullshit his way to the top because he has a bunch of broken skills because those skills end up canceling each other out<br><br>Touta only won early fights because of his immortality and underlying blood traits, once he fought an opponent with real skill who was determined to kill him he got his shit kicked in<br><br>Akamatsu is quite clearly taking the "shounen retard protagonist who wins for no good reason" trope and using it to build a more nuanced character who understands that you can't kill Fate or the Lifemaker just by hitting them really hard, even if you believe in yourself and your friends- you need real skill and actual powers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In all the early fights Touta would just run in, get his shit pushed in and then win because "I am berserking". That's pretty standard for "retard shounen protagonist".<br><br>It isn't really being carefree when your first instinct is always "I hit it with muh sword", that's just dumb.</br></br></br>  <br> 14 year old <br><br>2 year old.</br></br></br>  <br> Magic cancel <br>Magic cancel şs a passive ability<br>That was not magic cancel, if he had it it would be avaible from start</br></br></br>  <br> "I want to be strong and beat this strong guy up" <br>That´s just fake.<br>Tota is not a moron idiot or something.<br>he has lost his memory 2 years ago and is basically just 4 years old.He just lacks<br>expierince.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think Dana had her imprisoned. She most likely was allowed to leave after passing Dana's training.</br>  <br>They mentioned that he had the white magic of the Martian royal family, Magic Cancel</br>  <br>He won like, one fight. Against the guy who taught him instant movement. That's all.</br>  <br>He has explicitly stated his goal as being nothing special, just "beating up Fate Averruncus"- that's not a real goal, he doesn't know what he actually wants to do or if he wants to bang his mother-figure or not but he certainly wants to fuck her past self</br>  <br>He's an idiot, but not in a bad way.<br>It's more like, he'll let go his chance of meeting her for someone's sake, that kind of idiot behavior.</br></br>  <br> first instinct </br>  <br>Exactly, then he started losing because the story began to move in the direction of "looks like charging in and hitting it with your sword isn't actually a good strategy"<br><br>Development, man</br></br></br>  <br>All that proves is that he wasn't a complete retard back then</br>  Touta is a good MC, Although now only concerned with Kitty and nothing else.<br><br>Touta has won only three matches that matter.</br></br>  <br> All that proves is that he wasn't a complete retard back then <br>That´s enough.</br></br>  <br>Well, that was the point... at least he knows that trying the same thing over and over again and fail over and over again is insane. <br><br>I bet that Nagi would have thrown himself against Fate and tried it until he won, but Touta is not that stupid.</br></br></br>  Well just read the chapter, I guess that Touta will miss the deadline, even with Kirie helping him loop to get the books. Also, I hope that this short arc becomes Kirie's own arc with Touta, and helps her bridge the gap into becoming one of Touta's broes. <br><br>Also smug Touta was kind of nice, I hope he does that more from time to time.</br></br>  Touta have the imagine breaker.  <br>Probably more like magic bounce or reflect.</br>  <br>Nagi is a perfect "retard shounen protagonist". Touta looks like a cross between Nagi and Negi.<br><br>i like it that.</br></br></br>  <br>He had no choice... but really he should have jumped with her or something and gone back in time to join her. <br><br>Protect her smile idiot!</br></br></br>  <br>Nagi the strongest ever lived and pretty smart in battle<br>Touta was a dumbass when fighting too</br></br>  <br> pretty smart in battle <br>No</br></br>    pretty smart in battle <br><br>Rakan = Nagi. They have talent but they are stupid and reckless.</br></br>    <br>Blame imouto and Yukihime for giving him massive self esteem issues, which then keep him from going all the way with Kitty</br>  <br>So in the end Yukihime ruined her own love life? I actually would find that funny if it wasn't so sad.</br>  <br>ironic.</br>  <br/>  <br><br>Don't worry, Kirie will probably be ready for the rebound and will console Touta when the time comes, so not everything is lost. <br><br>At least Touta will get a happy end if he tries to look past Yukihime.</br></br></br></br>  So, is Touta able to use magic now? With the powers not conflicting anymore he should be able to right?  <br>He should use magic now. i hope.</br>  <br>Probably he should, but knowing Ken, Touta will stick on his magic counter thing and only that. We can't have the kid becoming too Op right now, right?</br>  <br>Kitty or bust, nigga</br>  <br>Nah, the Kitty romance is doomed, doomed, next time they meet Kitty will be evil and shit and Touta will reject her!</br>  <br>then we have to see that.</br>  <br>Nah, he'll fight her and attempt to befriend her.</br>  <br><br>I don't have hope, Touta can't protect her smile... I sadly know that. But this is necessary, because if Touta wants to love her, he has to know her past and know Eva at her worst.</br></br>  <br> He won became the best because he nuked peopel strong </br>  <br>yes</br>  So guys, do you think that Touta will get to meet Kitty or will the poor guy fail and get depressed again?  <br>Enjoy being wrong</br>  <br>prove</br>  <br>A miracle.</br>  <br>But if a miracle happens and they meet again, do you think that Touta would still like Kitty after she becomes an evil mage? <br><br>Also will Kirie score some points in this arc?</br></br></br>  <br>Touta love Eva. i dont think that change</br>  <br>Agree with you on this, guy had to rush his finale just to be able to write ANYTHING related to Negima for the future... and what's done is done..<br><br>  When UQ first came out gave the complete shits with how horrible Touma is... but you've got anime regurgitating the same kind of flawd clones, Touma's faults are refreshingly different  </br></br></br>  <br> Touta was a better MC than most people expected, honestly people should give the kid a chance.  </br>  <br>people dont give him a chance because they wish Negi.</br>  <br>If Nagi was only strong because he nuked his enemy blindly, he would have a weakness.<br>Jack states he has no weaknesses</br></br>  <br>Because he was obscenely strong and was great at fighting.<br>Exactly like Rakan.</br></br>  <br>I'm a bit brain dead getting a simple name wrong, well, regardless I'm hoping for clever cameos in the future battle arc soon.</br>  <br>People expected too much of a Negi clone and ended disappointed and wanted to dispose of him, pretty much the same in-universe.</br>  <br>But at least people are startibg to like him more and that's something right?</br>  Nagi &gt; Rakan?  <br>yes. that is something.</br>  <br>Yeah, Nagi was the strongest man in the world and it has to count for something right?</br>  Vampire guy will be there right?  <br>Probably in the arc after the tourney...</br>  <br>He probably will become Touta's rival while imouto will end up as Touta's tsundere love interest that will always snark at everythign Touta does.</br>  <br>First time drawing a chair?</br>  <br>Imotou love Eva too.</br>  <br>I want #2 to appear more.</br>  <br>Nah, Imouto will hate Eva and be jelly that Touta pays her more attention. She is the love rival you know.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Good, no protect her smile. <br> <br>Protip: You can't. </br> </br></br>  <br>ok, i see.</br>  <br>wrong eva and touma will be the family she always wanted.</br>  <br>Anon, we have to get the harem going, and we know Ken won't allow them to get together too quickly.</br>  <br>bah, i think that Ken is tired of harem.</br>  <br><br>Probably true, but still don't think that Ken will allow Touta to win the Evabowl this soon.</br></br>  <br>After almost 20 years, you can only hope.</br>  <br>Uq holder is a Story about Family not a Haram.<br>Dana is the srange aunt.<br>kiriwe the annoying sister<br>Santa is the little brother<br>and imouto is imouto.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Uq holder is a Story about Family not a Haram <br> imouto is imouto. <br>anon, that is nice</br></br></br>  <br>what´s wrong imotous can love they <br>brothers without romance.</br></br>  remenber<br> 2 week <br> 2 week <br> 2 week </br></br></br>  <br>Not in this industry, the only imoutou that is pure was the one from Yahari.</br>  <br>Komachi?</br>  <br>Yep, her.</br>  <br>maybe he'll just be able to feed apps into ME or something.</br>  <br>He will go full Nanoha and load apps into his sword to get new spell effects via ME and to fuel Magic Cancel.</br>  <br><br>his sword with ME or MC.<br><br>It´s a good idea.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yep, I bet Ken will eventually start doing all kind of cool stuff with the Apps, MC, ME and the Sword when he gets the time, that's why he introduced afro guy and wheelchair guy.</br></br>  <br>While I doubt that specifically will happen, it's definitely been telegraphed that Touta needs to find a way to integrate his gravity sword fighting tricks with the powers he's now developing.<br><br>That's something I really respect about how Ken is doing UQH. We're not getting the usual shonen bullshit power cycle. "Oh no, I got my ass kicked. Ah ha, I've learned an invincible super move to win the rematch. Oh no, a new opponent my super move in useless against. Ah ha, I've developed an entirely new super move to counter him."<br><br>Instead we see Touta learning new things one at a time, building on what he's learned before and hinting at what his full potential is like. His weaknesses are something people comment on, including himself, and sometimes he loses fights because of them. There's no single instant solution and instead of learning single super moves he's usually picking up broad styles with multiple applications.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, I guess it depends on the details of how Touta's new move works, depending on what it does it will open new options for Touta to fight.</br>  <br><br>maybe he will use his second sword and black<br>sword for this.I think the second sword will be special like a pactio sword.</br></br></br>  <br>But I want her to pat my head.</br>  <br> &gt;maybe he will use his second sword and black <br> sword for this.I think the second sword will be special like a pactio sword. <br>Maybe the second sword will be a magic app sword, so that one can get spell effects, while the gravity one is for heavy attacks. <br><br>Basically Touta would end up switching swords on the fly to make new techniques and stuff. <br><br><br>I bet she will pat Touta in the head after the tournament ends and they make up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We still haven't met five of the people in this picture, and imouto hasn't been befriended yet</br>  <br> I bet she will pat Touta in the head after the tournament ends and they make up. <br><br>But she still won't have acknowledged him, or remember that Touta she met hundreds of years earlier</br></br></br>  <br>They will have a fight in the tournament, and that's when Touta will force her to acknoledge him, and after that she will pat his head back to show her affection or something. <br><br>It will be sweet.</br></br></br>  <br>so he is the first orthodox Vampire.<br>I want Touta to make his own Vampire.<br>I knew who.<br>1:koroumarou after he turned 16.<br>&lt;</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But it will be a motherly pat on the head, Touta still needs to get stronger so that she remembers the him from the past</br>  <br>Don't worry, she will melt when he calls her Kitty, you know it will happen. <br><br><br>Can Touta even turn someone into a Vamp? We have never seen him drinking blood, right? So is he still a vamp?</br></br></br></br>  Touta and Kitty pactio. I want.  Maizuru Anthology Volume 8 raws coming soon.

To get high quality scans, the book has to be ripped apart, right?</br>    <br>Yeah, these are just digital raws from bookwalker. If you want true high quality raws you need to buy a physical copy, debind it, and scan it with a good flatbed scanner.</br>  <br>It means that there are people willing to buy books and tear them apart to share with strangers over the Internet. I'm touched.</br>  <br>That's why raw providers usually buy two copies, one for themselves and one to debind.</br>  <br>Thay need donation?</br>  <br>Depends on who it is, some just do it because they're already involved in the scanlation of the series and have disposable income. Others charge for price and labor of scanning it. I don't think we have anyone here who goes out of their way to debind and scan physical copies, though.</br>  <br>The digital files seem fine enough. Is there any need for physical scans?</br>    <br>Only for doujinshi that chinks don't scan but those are hard to get a hold on and more difficult to be willing to take apart.</br>      <br>Urakaze and Isokaze are better.<br><br>Chests not wuite as big but a much better and more reasonable size. Tittymonster isnt a good look.</br></br></br>  <br> Urakaze <br>Disgusting</br></br>  <br>These two are so bland looking it hurts.</br>  <br>FAT</br>  <br><br><br><br>?</br></br></br></br>  <br>rude</br>   Poi   <br>You don't know what bland looking means.</br>  <br> ioP </br>  <br>Yes?</br>  <br> Pya </br>  <br> kamo </br>  <br> Refrain </br>  <br> come back </br>  <br>That recent wave of cute artwork its too much for me, pls help me Hamabro.</br>  <br>Their only noticable feature is their tits.<br><br>Asside from that they are both painfully dull.</br></br></br>  <br> Sleep forever </br>    <br>Those are pretty dull designs.
