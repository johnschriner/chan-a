Maybe even a keyhole sweater.<br>Or something that fits summer better like having her hair tied up, wearing only an oversized t-shirt  cute or lewd-ish are both okay!   <br><br>- Cooling off poolside in a bikini, kicking at the water. Perhaps a Canada day theme for the swimsuit?<br><br>Please and thanks as always!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes she's there. Can't wait for the mass shark attack.</br>  Good luck, faggots!  Sharkbro can't possibly be human. He must be some sort of god.  Requesting my beloved Mizuhashi Parsee wearing a green qipao in a tsundere and jealously way please  <br>I didn't request one then.

Super loose settings with good pressure control or erasing?</br></br>  <br>It happens. People should consider adding 4chan to their browsers. It more easily allows you to browse 404'd threads and easier to catch a delivery.</br>  <br>Thanks anon.<br>And mix of both, I guess.<br>Here's my brush settings for the pen I used if you're interested. Pen stablelizer's typically around 3-4.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks. My linework has always been shoddy and the best I can do is make it neat but then its very mechanical. I don't have enough pressure control really, not while keeping accuracy.</br>  Requesting Tohka playing in a swimming pool or riding a bicycle-form Sandalphon  requesting Shichika eating icecream  <br>It's when you talk like a huge faggot, with tildes and exclamation marks everywhere.</br>    <br>Not OR for any of those, but it looks really good.</br>  <br>This is shaping up real nice.

I can't wait to see the finished version!</br>   shark will post when you're asleep <br> will miss all the fun <br><br>Hurry up damnit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That was a different requester that asked for the pokemon, lay off Miobro</br></br>  <br> 2:23 PM <br> going to bed </br></br>  <br>OR here, the guy that answered you wasn't me.<br><br>The pokedelivery wasn't requested by me. I requested at 1AM and gone to sleep.<br>Then some other guy arrived at 3:30AM, and requested. If it was me, I would have linked my request in the post to give Pokemon anon a proper ref to draw her.

If you can't replicate it then use the reference to the bottom left<br> Why those references? <br>Those were the only images that had those clothing on her. Trust me when I said those were the only images</br></br>  <br>your waifu is cute!<br><br>enjoy your weekend, anon!<br><br><br>have a happy weekend too!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting anything of Ayame  cute, lewd, or sexy.     <br>Based Broa</br>  <br>Boa when will you draw her?</br>  <br>Good work as usual, but your hands and lower bodies are consistently disproportionately small.

Don't believe her lies.</br>  <br>I can't help but be envious</br>  <br>Requesting hand waifus holding circles in a circle</br>  Circle is old news, you stupid faggots. It's all about the tetrahedrons now.  <br>I wish circlejerking was bannable.</br>  <br> hand waifus <br>so literally circlejerking</br></br>  <br> banning spirit circle threads <br>You have no soul.<br><br><br>Fuck polyhedra, fuck you for reminding me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who are the circle waifus?</br>  <br><br>It was a quick sketch. I can color it if you want this</br></br>   he still thinks there's a circle <br> they don't realize we moved into an octagon a long time ago </br>  Requesting a Jewish man made of circles wringing his hands, gleeful at how his whore was drawn by over 6 million drawfags while your pure, untouched waifu will never get even a 2 minute sketch.  <br>But they arent jerking the circles</br>  <br> Needs more bulge.  Sweet drawing though.</br>  <br>Love the pose, not OR. I hope you'll draw  him  one day.</br>  Oh, is this the "drawcucks ironically list geometrical shapes to pretend they aren't a bunch of cancerous circlejerking avatarfags" part of the thread?   Circle shit destroying the thread yet again   Guys, there's no such thing as "the circle".  <br>What have you done</br>  <br>Go into the streams and witness it yourself</br>  hug circle drawfriends  WWD, where we shit on drawfags for drawing despite wanting to have quality deliveries. <br><br>Only allowed to be a drawfag if you never ever do anything but post deliveries to the pre-approved waifus.</br></br>  <br>Here ya go bub.</br>  <br> no ducks <br>Disappointed.</br></br>  Why is the booru important again?  <br>It's not. No one gives a shit about it and it's horribly managed. Best to just delete it.</br>  <br>Drawcucks want to show off how much they've drawn, and they want your waifu's deliveries to be easily accessible to underage cancer.<br><br>Just fucking get rid of it already, Christ.</br></br></br>  <br>All it's good for is for people to stroke their e-dicks on how many deliveries they have.</br>  <br>It would actually have to be actively tagged for anyone to actually know.</br>  <br>It's for tracking your highscore.</br>  I simply wish to see wholesome Clione's soft and pretty face flowing with tears of sorrow and despair.  <br><br>just noticed I forgot the wings also.</br></br>  <br>Which waifus have the high scores here?</br>  <br>I use it to check if somebody else requested my wifu and recieved drawings, pretty useful stuff if you want to monitor a certain character's drawings on 4chan.</br>  <br>Ooh, nice. I like his pose and expression here. <br><br>You can color it if you feel up to it, doesn't matter too much to me.<br><br>In any case, thank you, drawbro!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you very much, based Boa. <br><br>She's doing what I wish I could be doing right now. <br><br>I appreciate your effort, I really do love it!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I tried my best </br></br>  <br>Oora!</br>  <br>The cute ones obviously</br>  <br> oora kanako 198 <br> not even part of the 200+ club <br><br>Yea nah</br></br></br></br>  <br>With you saying that, watch her get two more impromptu deliveries</br>  <br>Bueno.</br>  <br> just as planned </br>  <br> a lot of good stuff wasn't even uploaded on booru <br> more than a half of drawings are tagmes <br> any bored fag may vandalize it <br>I find that cringeworthy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Choco's tags were deleted.</br>  Just came here to remind you guys that  even Satou has a better love life than you.   Yeah but I'm in education and I can leave the house no problem  Don't invite blogging.  <br>Not at the beginning of the series. and maybe if I'm neet enough Misaki will come to 'save' me and one of the girls I used to talk do in high school will use me to get through her relationship problems.</br>  <br><br>Actually I am sure most guys here had a similar "love life" to Satou. I refuse to believe that most of the people here are basement dwelling neckbeards who never had contact to females, especially considering that every third poster on all of 4chan seems to have a gf nowadays.<br><br>You pretty much cant run away from getting closer to some girl, unless you are actively avoiding contact or just became extremely unlucky.<br>Of course I am only speaking about Satous level of love life, which does not say much, considering he is still a virgin.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Sato needs to get on Yamazaki's level.</br>  why did satou hallucinate the characters from brave little toaster  <br>He took a shit load of drugs, and what else was he going to, have his bed and chair talk to him?</br>  <br><br> anime fags <br><br>Yamazaki fucked that girl with the lisp and enjoyed it, anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think you are being too optimistic. A lot of guys start being basement dwelling neckbeards even after having an average social life at adolescence.</br>  <br>i only leave the house when going for work, the job i got is 99% male environment, in the weekends i just browse imageboards and watch animu, i haven't spoke with a female other than mom and sister in at least 3-4 years, can't remember exactly, the thing is i don't mind it at all, i mean, i already accepted the fact that i will be alone for all my life so all i seek now is comfyness, i'd love to be a full time hikikomori neet and ocasionally going camping innawoods, but i don't have enough money for that, i have no other desires nor hobbies<br>t. 22 lvl</br></br>  <br>Looks like my life. But I've been working from home since last year so I don't hope it to get better anytime soon.</br>  Since the other thread is filled with shitposting.<br><br>The aragami designs were accurate to the game. The CGI for them is noticeably different compared to the characters.<br><br>The shadowy thing on top of the rubble looked like the first "boss" from the game.<br><br>The training room was the tutorial room.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why isn't episode 0 subbed since the 720p raws are out?  Amy stitches?  Any word on who might be subbing this or just Funi?  <br>Daisuki is subbing it. I think they have an exclusive contract.<br><br>http://www.daisuki.net/<br><br>It's free to watch in 480p but if you make a free account you can watch up to 1080p. They make money through ads it seems.</br></br></br></br></br>  Don't use this thread, we already have one <br><br/></br>  <br>Fun fact, 8 animation directors and 12 studios worked on the first episode. The fact that these production credits only appear on the site and not on the episode might be a show of embarrassment.</br>  <br>It's just the 2011 OVA + staff talk show.<br><br><br> I think they have an exclusive contract. <br>Anime Consortium Japan which is running Daisuki is on the production committee.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that random teddy bear in the middle of the webm </br>  <br>We already have this thread you fucking /v/ermin retard. Stop embarrassing yourself.</br>  <br><br>That's the one filled with shitposts.<br><br><br>Is that why it was delayed? Production issues?<br><br><br>Here's one but it's fucking awful because the background moves and lighting changed during the pan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How on earth are they all wearing fitted sleeves with these gigantic bracelets that they can't remove? How did Utsugi take off his jacket?</br>  <br>It was shit.<br><br><br> That's the one filled with shitposts. <br>Because its shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not sure how to feel about the show yet. Maybe because I haven't played the game.<br><br>I already have a feeling that either the Branch Director or Lindow will turn into the big bad, though. Both of them have that traitor vibe.</br></br></br></br>    <br> That's the one filled with shitposts. <br> If they don't praise the show they must be shitposting! </br></br>  <br>You can not praise the show and it still wouldn't be as bad as that thread. Don't be delusional.</br>  A pretty decent first episode, these CGI artstyle(?) is starting to grow on me, it looks way better than SIdonia at least.<br><br>Unfortunately, I can already see people calling it fujoshit anime if it does well like Kekkai.</br></br>  <br>NNB is shit<br>Euphonium is shit<br>GE isn't shit<br>Because it isn't boring</br></br></br></br>  <br> it isn't boring <br>But it is.</br></br>  I wonder if she masturbates with machine oil.  <br> Bringing up two completely unrelated shows <br><br>IRC at full force for this show, I see.</br></br></br>  <br> Anime this shit doing well. </br>  is this burst or not ?  <br> if it does well <br>Not going to happen so don't worry.</br></br>  <br>Lindow dies like a bitch early on.</br>  <br><br>I remember people telling me this when AOT and Free aired too. Screencapped just in case</br></br>  I think it looked pretty good for CG. It's good enough that I didn't feel like dropping it in the middle of the episode. I'll actually stick with it unlike all the other previous CG shows.  <br> Non Non Biyori <br> Working!!! <br> Trouble darkness <br> Moster girls <br>I would be really surprised if this show ends up selling well.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Every post get redirected to /v/,MAL and reddit <br> Not shitposting <br>Nice try shitposter-kun but anyone with half a brain will see that the other thread went to shit.<br>Nobody is discussing the show since everyone is too busy trying to frame the other as a /v/ermine.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I found that surprisingly enjoyable. I don't really know anything about the show though so I assume it will go to shit.</br>  <br> Unfortunately, I can already see people calling it fujoshit anime if it does well like Kekkai. <br>Nah, that kind of shitposter is being distracted by gangsta.</br></br>  <br>Everybody saw SnK selling, it was obvious as hell.<br>Good thing Japan hates God Eater as well.</br></br>  <br>That's because it isn't primarily CG but mostly hand drawn with extremely heavy filtering. If you pay attention you will spot the difference.</br>  <br> It's just the 2011 OVA + staff talk show. <br>Right but the only available sub I've seen is like 320p. Surely someone would've slapped subs on the 720p version by now.</br></br>  <br>The hell is going on with his collarbones?</br>  <br/>  <br>I'll take it. It looks mostly good for enough of the anime that I don't hate it.</br>  Pretty sure this is what the leader was.  <br>The show isn't entirely CGI like Sidonia.</br>  <br>For some reason they seem to have decided to take hand drawn and get close to the look of the game using post-processing rather than just using CG. Maybe because you can get better animation from hand drawn. At least that is what I think from watching it and looking at the credits there are tons more normal animators credited with working on the episode than CGI artists so they must have been drawing something. The monsters seemed entirely CG though.</br>  <br> Japan hates God Eater as well. <br><br>Sauce: My ass</br></br></br>  <br> m-muh MANime </br>   B-but muh 2D anime <br>I have no problem watching this since I wanted to play the games, but kinda forgot about them</br>  <br> show with brown prostitutes and actual onscreen sex <br> fujoshit <br>you fucking wot m8, at least call Aoharu fujoshit</br></br></br>  <br>Not same anon but if I get bored to death with those anime then i'm <br> muh MANime?  <br><br>KyoAni shitposters need to die</br></br></br></br>  <br>The show has 2 sexy men as the lead. You know the Fujoshi will be all over that.</br>  <br> This is what shitposters actually think </br>   fake sales fags don't realize bamcos doing the exact same distribution strategy Cinderella girls did. For God Eater as well.  <br><br>Sure must be nice having the best competitive advantage in terms of publishers</br></br>  It kinda looks like they're trying to copy the techniques used in Kotonowa no Niwa along with some sort of filter and lots of shading to try and get it to look closer to the game, characters and weapons are definitely not CG but the backgrounds and aragami definitey are ,anime has had CG backgrounds for years now, look at almost any seasonal action anime and "dynamic" scenes, even Pokemon uses it now.<br><br>Still, it's a game adaptation so it's probably going to end up being trash.</br></br>  <br><br> Thinking the characters are CG <br><br>It's like you faggots have never seen shading before</br></br></br></br>    <br> thumb placement <br>So, I'm wondering how they go through all this work with multiple levels of shading and still nobody manages to realize her hand is on backwards.</br></br>  <br>Just you wait until you're looking at sadpanda one day and then you see those two shirtless on the cover of a doujin all about them fucking each other complete with silly hand motions.</br>  <br>nigga you can have shading without making them look like shit</br>  <br><br>It's not. That's just shittily drawn perspective on that hand</br></br>  <br>UFOTABLE IS FINISHED</br>  <br> He thinks because cowtit prostitute is in it it's not fujoshit <br>Two bishounen buff leads who take up a majority of the screen time, noticeable female audience.<br><br>Gotta keep in mind this is Japan we're talking about, not Tumblr landwhales(and even then they like it.)</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know about the new season but I remember Crowds was pretty Fujoshi</br>  <br>Only autists care about that. It's a fucking minor mistake and you fucking know it. <br><br>Bothers you so much? buy BDs.</br></br></br>  <br>Crowds is omnipandering but Sugane is gay as fuck for Joe, and this season they amped it up</br>  <br>The only one suitably Fujoshi-bait in that is Joe, and he barely gets any screentime anyway. That show as a whole went pretty unnoticed, but there were a few Hajime doujins.<br><br>Gangsta has 2 sexy male leads with all the screentime. That makes a big difference.</br></br></br>  <br>The point is it's still not CG you blind faggots.</br>  <br> Only autists care about that. It's a fucking minor mistake and you fucking know it. </br>  <br><br><br>Literally every studio draws perspective shittily at some point. Modern anime scheduling means you get 1 shot to get it right, if not you have to move on and suck it up.</br></br></br>   gameplay is some monhun ripoff <br> game story is evangelion ripoff <br> anime made to be SnK ripoff because that got popular <br>Amazing.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That's the connective tissue from her wrist to her hand.<br><br>The placement is fine.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>God eater predates AoT by one year, but nice try</br></br>   next ep probably   Is this CG?  <br>Does it matter? All that should matter is if you like it, regardless of the production.</br>  <br>What is the shadow framing his face even? If I didn't know better I'd mistake it for lazily drawn stubble. Same for  as well.</br>  <br>I get they had a hard-on for 5-tone shading, but you can do it without it looking like CG. Just fix your coloring.</br>  <br>No. Shading.<br><br>Anyways, this <br>But faggots like you can't decide wheter they like something unless someone else tells them. <br><br>I like it by the way, not sure about the story</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does it matter what, dumblord? Or do you think I'm asking "Is this CG? If yes then I'll drop it." or what?</br>    Is it more or does Sidonia actually look better than the stylized 3dcg of God Eater?<br><br>I can't put my finger on it but there's something just wrong about it.</br></br>   **1,141位/**1,045位 (***,155 pt) [*,**0予約] 2015/10/29 GOD EATER / ゴッドイーター vol.1 (特装限定版) [Blu-ray] <br>UFOTABLE found a way!</br>  <br>to fuck up a show</br>  <br>Ufotable is the new shaft, they can only milk one franchise.</br>  <br>Jesus.

Dropped before even the download is complete.<br><br>Such a disappointing animation. It feels like they missed some critical steps towards making the cgi watchable.</br></br>  <br>Euphorium doesn't have nearly the same level of shading and detail as the first episode of GE consistently did. KyoAni only details their hair for most shots, then adds easy neck shadows and some blush. They do add more detail to some scenes, but it's clearly a special moment when they do. A lot of KyoAni's resources also go into still backgrounds.<br><br>GE has 2 levels of shadows and highlights on every surface, along with much more detailed fabrics. Each individual frame of animation has a lot more detail to it to it.</br></br></br>  <br>Well they won't run out of material for like 20 years so it's ok as long as it keeps selling.<br><br>It's not only fate also, they have TM fanbase.

Shizuo more so because of his pouty face and incredibly bright hair. Izaya's hair isn't bad but there's something about his face that bugs me.</br></br>  <br>That's why it's not a legit question, why would they give you a Vita? Those extras are already generous as fuck.</br>  <br>it's not 8500$, it's 8500 yen, equivalent to 85$</br>  Anymore announced at wonfes?  <br>You'll know in two weeks.</br>  Can't wait for my next paycheck so I can buy some Hestia Figs.    <br><br>They have to. Momo and Mea were like 6 months apart from each other, Sairenji took a year, hopefully with Darkness 2nd Season they'll show at least one prototype and a picture of another one.</br></br>  <br>hey, there's /y/ and /cm/ for faggots such as yourself.</br>  <br>Hoping for Yami or Mikan.<br><br>Waiting for Amiami to put up this beauty. It's unfair that TLR has so many good upcoming figs and great figs in general.</br></br></br>  <br> Waiting for Amiami to put up this beauty <br>This</br></br>  <br>I've thought about getting this because I'm a sucker for lolis and gradients<br>Don't know if I'll get arrested or not, though</br></br>  <br>Waiting for the lingerie yami. I'm not too fond of loli or darkness edge Yami.</br>  This will get a rerelease right? RIGHT?<br>Why do I miss out on all the good things in life?</br>  <br>It actually did get a rerelease. On hobbystock though.<br><br>I was able to get one when I went to Japan in May. Feels good.</br></br></br>  <br>Absolutely not</br>  <br><br>Not to fond of her, leaving aside that I really don't like loli Yami since she's nothing like the Yami I like, the scale just looks too simple for that price, I mean, just to compare it to the other TLR scales coming out, Trance of Darkness, Sairenji and Kotegawa are only 1-2k~ more then her, and they just look way above her in detail, sculpting and quality, can't shake of the feeling she should be like 7k max.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I mean a fourth rerelease.<br><br><br>Stop hurting me anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ryoubi, Ryouna, and if this poll holds up until the 14th (updated on the 10th) Yozakura will get a daki.<br><br>I'll buy Ryouna and Yozakura if thats the case.

Hair looks kinda clumped together with her, like they just wanted to pump it out asap. Like they could cut corners with time because she's just wearing a night gown</br>  <br>Ignore the homosexual plebeians, anon. A true connoisseur would know that Hestia is one of the greatest idols of our generation. She is assuredly a gift from the gods.</br>  <br>She has too many good figs coming out (two is too many).<br><br>Sento is more appealing and doesnt have shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Not lewd enough. Aside from that fact, that art style just looks odd on a daki.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>So much fig material with her. I have the toyworks set, it's so cute.</br>  So much terrible taste lately<br><br> to love ru <br> danmachi <br> amagi <br> senran <br> pochaco <br> /v/ shit <br> sao <br><br>What happened to these threads?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Both were just FoTM shit, that's why they didn't get many scales. Since scales need from 6 months to a year to release they need to make them from characters that are actually going to last more than just the initial 4 months hype. <br><br>I'm fairly sure once the Amakuni Hestia is released everyone is going to be like "Oh, right I ordered this.. meh"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> wahh wah stop liking things that i don't like </br>  <br>How can you tell me that this isn't, beyond the shadow of a doubt, absolutely and undeniably perfect?</br>  <br>Well anon in a year I'll let you know</br>  <br>Agreed, we need some REAL figs like Miku and Saber.</br>  <br> senran <br> pochaco <br>Did nothing wrong</br></br></br>  <br>You are fucking with me right.</br>  <br><br>Heh, forgot the picture.</br></br>  <br>I sincerely believe Sento has staying power and I'm waiting for the good figs to come out for her.</br>  <br>Give us your taste then.</br>  <br>It's so much better when the fags don't even know the name of the character or where it's from when they buy them.</br>  <br>What is "good taste" for you, friend?</br>   tfw I don't know if I want this  <br><br> &gt;inb4 kek la meme </br></br>  <br>Because Sento is literal perfection.</br>  <br>Actually, I'm sure that by that time, DanMachi Season 2 will have just started premiering. As such, hype will be rebuilt, and people who didn't order the fig are gonna be kicking themselves for not doing so.</br>  Post your preorders and rate others.  <br>I'm sure I want it <br> Kek la meme </br></br>  <br><br>is sad because it's true, since she has a April-May release set and there's at least another 2 scales from Amakuni coming out around that time I wouldn't be surprised if she was delayed until Jun/July.</br></br>  <br>Literally anything that's not a mascot, a boat, or generic harem/ecchi shit.<br>I'd rather see the fucking Free boys than the garbage you guys post.<br><br><br>Even this mediocre shit is better than 95% of the other figures posted itt.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>shit/10</br>  <br>I picked her up at  AX , she's pretty cute. I'd go for it, if I were you.<br><br>And to set the record straight, KlK was excellent, and is not a meme.</br></br></br>  <br>Underage weeb/10</br>  <br> one piece <br>No.</br></br>  <br/>  <br> he actually thinks they are going to make a second season in a year <br><br>How new are you? <br><br>Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't the BDs selling like shit?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Only 1 idol <br> No ya yoi or Iori <br>bruh.....</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>The crying is disgusting though. Stuff like this never translates well in 3D.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I haven't even touched that prop.</br>  <br>Fits her because she was the biggest pile of turd in the entire show.</br>    <br>Honestly, that's one of the reasons why I want her<br>That was one of the cutest things she did</br></br>  <br>Takane is the only good one that is out/up for preorder.<br><br>Chihaya, Haruka, Azusa arent up yet. Waiting for Anya.</br></br></br>  <br>The splash look like hands</br>  <br>Her and Senketsu made the show kill yourself retard.</br>  <br>So keen for more  Perrine. </br>  <br><br>Kongo Bust not yet pre-ordered, waiting until WonFest to see if if I'll actually get it.</br></br>  I'll be able to buy pic related sealed in box locally for $50 CAD. The ad mentions something about "Sp parts included". Anyone know what that means? were there some exclusive extras I don't know about?  <br>Pre-orders for it close Wednesday though.</br>  <br>SP stands for "Semen Painted".</br>  <br>Hairbuns were a GSC preorder bonus</br>    <br><br>Thank you. Also is $50 CAD a good price for her. I think I've seen her cheaper in some places but shipping would push it way over that price.</br></br>  <br>If only they would release CA statues. I would buy the fuck out of a  Pretty Salian figma. </br>  <br><br>It was extended actually, which is nice. Didn't really feel comfortable ordering something that expensive for Jan with still a lot of stuff market as 2015 on my waiting list and Wonfest around the corner.</br></br>  <br>You're pushing it.</br>  <br>tell me that top comes off.</br>  <br>I saw the Kongo Bust at AX. Personally wouldn't buy it and I like Kongo a lot for what it's worth.</br>  <br>Bishoujos aren't cast off.</br>  <br>IT's a craigslist ad and It 's been up for over a month think i should try asking for $40 or something</br>  <br>She's going for $52 on amazon right now, and I've seen her on manda for 5500 yen. You missed out though, a couple days ago amazon dropped the price to $36.65. I managed to snag her up before they raised it again. 50 isn't a bad price with the bonus.</br>  <br>Yeah most of the villains were shit, MC was shit. <br>Almost all of the supporting cast were shit. <br>Mediocre over hyped anime is over hyped</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeh i saw that, it was only for amazon.com and i live in canada. The exchange rate + shipping would be bad.</br></br>  <br><br>Aw shit, just noticed you were talking about Moosebucks. I thought we were talking about freedomdollars. Disregard what I said.</br></br>  <br> Dat Momo <br>Holy shit where?</br></br>  <br> the guide </br>  Opened this just today. Nothing's too special, but as a Keyfag I'm impressed with how the box is put together.<br><br>$170 well spent.</br></br>  <br><br>God damn, I just saw this after reading your post, granted, I didn't liked how the normal version looked, but it looks worse on person it seems. Hoping that the Keiondou ver doesn't look as bad, but even then, not so sure about getting her now.</br></br>  <br>Running through store list now, should have occurred to me before I posted</br>  <br> nothing too special <br> $170 </br></br>  <br><br>That thing is fucking terrifying.</br></br>  <br>I remember wanting this like a year ago. Kinda glad I didn't buy it.</br>    <br>I feel the same way too, actually.<br><br>Then again, it's a collector's item that's really hard to find nowadays. I think there's value in that, at least.</br></br></br>  <br>Was a fucking moron and only preordered the game last year when it came up for preorder.</br>  <br> I think there's value in that, at least. <br><br>I can definitely empathize with that feeling. It'd absolutely be nice to have, but I know I won't be dropping ~$170 on it anytime soon.</br></br></br>  <br>If I'm honest the mouth sorta freaks me out, but it's not a deal killer to me.<br><br>And I need to stop getting into older series and expecting to find anything available for purchase. All it does it get me more hindpained the longer I search.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought it looked better in person. The viewing angle is pretty strict though I think. Looks creepy if seen from the wrong angle.</br>  <br>There's definitely going to be Touken Ranbu petits sometime in the near future. <br><br>I wonder if I should get a box to scalp.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Really wish they hadn't changed the designs for Shizuo and Izaya.</br></br>  Would you wear figures?  <br><br>I got pretty fucked over by the EMS shipping, actually. The box itself was only 9000 yen. The exchange rate didn't help either.<br><br>I've seen this box being priced at $400+. So yea, 170 is a bargain...sort of.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a little too much.<br><br>Keychain/badge armor is where it at.</br></br></br>  <br>Jesus, how could that thing cost so much to ship?</br>  <br>Should start rolling in soon.</br>  <br>Rate my taste but don't disagree with me</br>  <br>Were get at?</br>  <br> tfw missed Azusa pre order </br>  <br>They have 'em on eBay for comparable to what he paid.</br>  <br><br>To be fair, it was a large, 2.5 kilo box.<br><br>I tried SAL small packet, but Mandarake forced me to use EMS.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fixed that for you buddy</br>  <br>Fuck so it was you who bought that<br> I hope you enjoy it anon </br></br>  <br>Incoming shit taste.<br><br>(Wo and the CCS figs are currently being held captive by customs)</br></br></br>  <br>What is that in the 4th picture?</br>   sent from /jp to here <br><br>ive really been interested in figurine making lately. ive never sculpted in my life but ive looked into the process and kinda get it<br><br>is there anything i should know about in advance? especially about eyes and fine details and other methods</br></br></br></br>  <br>I debated for a while before deciding to get her, since I have no idea how high she'll go afterwards.<br><br>Eh I like Kaneki enough, even if it is Koto. I would've expected someone to cross out &gt;jointshit before anything else though.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, Lucina is cool, I hate TG with a burning passion but even I'll admit that figure is really well done</br>  <br><br>Ever since I missed out on it two years ago, I've been searching Mandarake for that box on a weekly basis. You'll be surprised how quickly these items come and go.<br> Thanks, by the way. Better luck next time :3 <br><br><br><br>Mini-posters. Similar to the ones you get off AmiAmi.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I have Alter Rin preordered because Rin is my favourite, but damn does Kotori look good. I'm getting tempted by her but I know if I do I'll end up getting all of them.</br></br>    <br>I still can't decide if I want that Sakura or not.<br>She looks too old in my opinion.</br></br>  <br>You're going to be absolute shit at it no matter what because you neither have the time, money, nor skill.</br>  <br>Then you don't. There's no reason to get it if you don't like it.</br>  <br>She's my favorite, and I love tomboyish girls; but point taken. Any apprehension should dictate 'do not buy'.</br>  last week's haul  <br>Yeah, but I'm expecting it to be delayed again to be honest.</br>    What do you guys think of her arse?    <br>Dat Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade.....<br>Want.</br></br>  <br>Welded</br>    <br> Alter Plamya <br>Nice. I like her much more than MF's but not many others seem to.</br></br>  want  <br>So glad there was a re-release for her 1/8 scale<br><br>Also managed to snag Takao from Ques Q for $85, did I do good</br></br></br>  <br>Are the glasses removable? Also i need to see her cunny before i can make decision.</br>  <br>It looks like shit.</br>  Someone tell me there's a site that still has the z-ton centaur daki for preorder. I was too late for amiami's preorder and I really want it.  <br>She's hot and you're shit.</br>  <br>he's right though it looks worse than prize figure quality</br>  <br>Why aren't you ordering superior Kogi?</br>  <br>I wanted it initially but I don't really like the paintjob/texture on it now.<br>Plus I'd prefer the blindfold/no-cat-ears version anyway. It's pretty big, too, which is the only reason I suspect it has that pricetag.</br></br>  <br>Might get this</br>  <br><br>She has a boy butt. At least she's cute from the front.</br></br>  Should I get her? I'm not familiar with im@s franchise, but her cuteness is off the charts.  <br>More like fugly</br>  <br>What is that face trying to convey?</br>  <br>Become familiar. Then get her.<br>Or do what I've done.<br>I'm guilty of preordering something I knew would sell out quickly (from a site that wouldn't penalize) and then going and watching the source material. Haven't cancelled anything yet.</br></br></br>  <br>Get what you like. <br><br>Figure collecting is based on aesthetic quality regardless, so knowing the source is irrelevant mostly.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't have much more room for scales. I just wanted a cohesive set of nendoroids I could display on my bookshelves, and I settled on the swordboys.<br><br>If they made a scale of Iwatooshi or Taroutachi I might have to buy it though.</br></br></br>  <br>sure</br>  <br>There's a site that still has the z-ton centaur daki for preorder.</br>  <br>Thanks</br>    <br>I want a scale of this guy and I don't even play the game</br>  <br>I like to collect "sets" of figures from the same manufacturer but alter's shinobu is so good i want it instead of the GCS one<br><br>also that girl on her knees is really cute i like her expression</br></br></br>  <br>I've vowed not to buy complete sets unless I really like all the characters. I'd like to believe I still have some sort of sense of financial responsibility despite spending a shitload of money on PVC.</br>  <br>I have no problem with buying figures from sources you don't know, but you always run the risk of later finding out that character is shit.<br><br>What if you watch/play iM@s one day and realise Yukiho is worst girl? What then?</br></br></br>  <br> Being a secondary </br>  <br>I can't read moon, also heard the game is shit either way.</br>  <br> I've vowed not to buy complete sets unless I really like all the characters. <br>Yeah I don't have any complete sets for this very reason. <br><br>Well, I do have one, but only because my autistic flatmate was so mad I was missing  Alter's Azusa  that she bought her for me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There are only two absolute deal breaker for me : <br>1. The girl is a town bike<br>2. The girl is a  angry, violent tsundere cunt <br>Judging from her looks, she's going to be Onodera tier at best. Which is pretty bad, but I can get behind it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That'd still be a complete set without her.</br>  <br> Onodera tier <br>What an insult.</br></br>  <br>I mean at worst. Fuck, I'm drunk.</br>  <br>She's neither of those things. She's shy and anxious to the point where she can barely function in society.<br><br>Probably quite relatable or cute for some people but irritating as hell for others.</br></br></br>  <br>The glasses are removeable and there is also a blindfold option.</br>  <br>Where do you get this pic?</br>  <br>Just look at the GK this figure is based on if you want to see her pussy.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127970679 <br>I got the original brunette version of 'Kokuten Tae'.<br>Wouldn't trade 'er for the world.<br>Also didn't know Luna Luna was getting an Anniversary exclusive re-release.</br></br></br>  <br>And the last 4 bluray of Shitgatsu and the other 3 other Chocolto who are not on MFC</br>  tfw alter chitoge is delayed  <br>First time I've seen anyone post that they're also buying that Mirai.</br>  <br>Source? Not that I wasn't fully expecting that.</br>  <br>no source but where is it if it won't be delayed<br> tfw started feeling it will be delayed since july 1st </br></br>  <br>I accidentally turned into a kinpatsu lover.</br>  <br>There is not so much figure of her and since I liked the character...<br>And the pose is kinda dynamic.</br></br>  <br>In the same boat. It's not a great figure but I'll take what I can get because I adore her.<br>I already have the Beach Queens one here. Glad I preordered since she went way up in price since.</br></br>  How reliable is Shopping Mall Japan's auction snipe service?     Doujinshi by my favorite artist doesn't get scanned <br> Want to buy it just so I can see its contents <br> Doesn't fucking exist anywhere online and I can't buy it <br>FUCK</br></br></br>  <br> She's shy and anxious to the point where she can barely function in society. <br>She's gotten better, and besides that she was nowhere near barely functional at the beginning. What are you smoking?</br></br>  What are the chances of a ps4 senran kagura edition being made?  <br><br/></br>  <br><br> Looks creepy <br> fucking terrifying. <br><br>but that's the good part. normal kongou looks boring.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nothing like the rush of watching the source before the figure arrives. If you ship USAL you don't even have a definite arrival date to go by.</br>  Who here ever commissioned art of their waifu, how do I go about it?  <br>This isn't the thread for it. Try Deviantart.</br>  <br>You're right, sorry I figured it was kind of buyfag related, my bad</br>  <br>Just ask in the draw thread, fam.</br>  <br> 52 cad <br>Why so cheap. Is this ad from mfc</br></br>  <br>I remember someone on here commissioned someone on Deviantart to draw him art for a daki<br><br>End result wasn't bad, but his other pieces of work were fucking awful</br></br></br>  <br>Well when I preorder it's usually months before it releases so I have plenty of time, haha. I wouldn't do it for something shipping very soon.<br><br><br>Better off finding an artist you like the work of and trying to commission them.

Phat's Makoto is coming out just before I'm going to Japan so was going to order her from HLJ and see what my funds were like but I missed her order window over there. Might just see if I can find her when I'm over there.<br><br>After getting into Cinderella Girls and recently picking up Mika after seeing her in person I'm tempted to grab Ranko and Rin as well, plus a friend of mine recently convinced me to watch Love Live and now I'm getting tempted by that, too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>/buyfag/ hates MFC cause they are drones with all those fucking nendos,miku,pochacow,sonico whatever jew smile company throws at them<br><br>MFC hates /buyfag/ caus,uhm well I never did a search 'bout that<br><br>It has been two years since checked on MFC top 100,still plenty of shitty of shitty figures<br><br>Check /buyfag/ today as a couple of days ago it was plenty of the same MFC top 100 figs well today seems a kinda better,but somedays is just plenty of people with shitty tastes</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Idk I liked her based solely on that futa doujin with makoto.</br>  <br><br>At the end of the month he says.

You should get it unless your a normie who likes sluts you shouldn't dislike her.</br>  I wonder if amazon's prime holiday will make things cheaper, if you keep an eye out and are wary for bootlegs amazon isn't a bad place. Got a scale G.E.M Tiger there for 19 dollars, shipped in pristine condition.  <br> Idk <br>I swear I'm seeing abbreviated shit like this far more frequently than I used to. Stop fucking using them and type like you have half a fucking brain. They're as bad as emoticons.</br></br>  <br>tbh I think you're overreacting.</br>    <br> Yukiho is shittiest 765 girl.

I got some scales and some tech devices (like a 4K TV) bookmarked just in case. <br>Let's report back on Wednesday.</br></br>  <br>Agreed, it needs to fucking stop. 4chan is not an instant messaging system.</br>  <br>you can get some nice figures for cheap on amazon if you wait long enough. Amazon partners will never lower their price, but if its sold by Amazon the price will go up and down. What you have to do is just add the figure you want to your cart and wait like 2 months or so, the price will usually go between its highest to lowest point within that time. Note when the cheapest price is and buy it next time it goes down to there. <br><br>One figure I was waiting for fluctuated from $55 to $99, and I got it at $55 shipped, so it arrived in 2 days.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, I was looking at taobaoring, will check out the others.<br><br>I'm looking to buy from a Chinese doujin circle who actually has a booth at Comiket, not from the endless bootleg merchandise.</br></br></br>  WHERE THE FUCK IS THE HYPE?!<br><br>WONFES IS IN TWO WEEK.<br>Where are the bingo sheets?<br>What unpainted/concept art are you looking forward to see being painted/displayed?</br></br></br></br>   buying figs of characters from a series you've never watched <br>Absolutely haram.</br>  <br>What do you expect from a filthy secondary?<br>These are the types of people you see buying figures based solely on their looking without knowing shit about them.</br></br>  <br>I still believe</br>    <br>I almost bought this girl because of her design, but after trying her game I wasn't as interested anymore.</br>  <br>MFC hates us because we are "too mean :'(" <br>They still like reading about our dank may mays on Reddit, though.</br></br>   Trying to find the Titty Monster Mousepads <br> Have to settle for Pre ordered Izayoi from Date a Live because the titty monsters like Pochaco will never be in stock again </br>  <br><br>Shitty tier figures from Jewsmile Company and MF<br><br>Probably Mega House will do a once in a while is another One Piece figure from some unknown anime/manga<br><br>Alter will do the same as MH giving you the illusion of them picking up the entire line then release more fujoshi and Strike Witches shitty figures<br><br>Kotobukiya is going to butcher up Ibuki by doing a derpy bishoujo figure instead of a proper one,but since MH got us covered who cares.Probably they will announce another overpriced Sakuya from Shining series<br><br>Bandai even more shitty Dragon Ball and Naruto figs<br><br>Banpresto even more shitty One Piece lottery figures with 5053 repaints and a you will not fetch it SQ figure of it<br><br>Square overpriced jointed crap with bootleg quality features<br><br>Tsume look is another overpriced sculpted polystone block that it will be delivered to your homes with broken and cracked pieces<br><br>Griffon what?<br><br>Ques Q more boatshit and probably some Touhou figure that it will be forgotten like Remilia<br><br>Aquamarine wut?<br><br>Orchid Seed we don't ship to you anymore,muh values,muh hotglued figs<br><br>Hobby Japan some crappy exclusive from a shitty franchise<br><br>Embrace Japan some good stuff with fucked up faces like their newer Chun Li<br><br>Wave moar Beach Queens cause yeah overpriced crap always sells<br><br>Can't even give some fucks to GK circles anymore cause they jumped into the boatshit cargo too<br><br>It will be a wonfest full of shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This is really cute despite the lewd.  <br> Orchid Seed we don't ship to you anymore,muh values,muh hotglued figs <br>nani?</br></br>  <br>I made my bingo sheet a week ago.

I already have 6 scales. They're beginning to outnumber my Strike Witches, which I didn't expect to happen.<br><br><br><br>Maki is my second favorite, but yeah, I wasn't sold on that one either.<br><br><br><br>Thanks Anon, I try.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My favourite argument.</br>  <br>Just wait for the other Maki then.</br>  <br>Wait for the school idol festival based one.<br>I was never a fan of the art that swimsuit one is based on and I don't think the figure looks that great either.</br></br>  <br><br>Oh, I can do that, but waiting for seven years or whatever it'll be until Alter release it won't be fun.</br></br>  <br> ... <br><br>Kill you're whole self.</br></br></br>  <br>It probably won't be that long since she's popular.<br>Umi seems to be the least popular in japan so who knows how long I'll have to wait for her.</br></br>  <br>Why, can you play it in English? Or do you mean every line has been translated on the wiki so everytime I'd want to play I'll have to check that crap? It's not worth it.</br>  <br>I guess. Umi's my second favourite though.<br><br>Meanwhile I can't stand Nico and she'll probably come first.</br></br></br>  I shouldn't encounter any warping/fading problems if I have a figure standing ~60cm away from an 11w cfl bulb, right?<br><br>The bulbs' almost always on.</br></br>  <br>Nico is definitely next since she was announced before they showed off their card choices for the rest.<br>I love Nico though and her figure could turn out really great if they don't skimp out on the base.</br></br>  <br>i would realy appriciate it if someday a can also play the game without any tricks from outside japan in a western localized version as my nihongo is basicaly nonexistent T_T</br>  <br>Get an LED bulb.</br>  <br><br>Its hard to work out who is the most popular sometimes. I always thought Rin wasn't popular, but then she becomes the SEGA mascot, gets a bunch of figures and her own ramen.</br></br>  <br><br>Its really pretty easy. There's English translations for damn near everything. You only need a proxy to sign up, then there's a documented cookie hack to make it work without a proxy.<br><br>Read the wiki, do it and hold on to your wallet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm mad people just suddenly started jumping on the rin bandwagon over there in japan out of nowhere.<br>Kotori was the most popular for a long time.<br>I-I liked Rin first!</br></br></br>  <br>I'll look into it. Am I safe in the mean time?</br>  <br> All that KanColle <br>my nigger. Not buying Musashi though?</br></br>  <br>I wish someone told me to hold onto my wallet when I started playing Tourabu.</br>  <br>No, go buy an led bulb immediately.<br>You won't regret it, they last a very long time and won't damage your figures.</br></br>  <br><br>Do it faggots.<br>I'm hyped as shit for this set and all of it's delays each figure will have.</br></br></br>  <br>Rin looks so plain compared to all the other outfits.</br>  <br>Her footprint is fucking huge because of the tail and sash, that seems to be where the most creativity went into her outfit.</br>  <br>Why did hanayo get the best outfit? Nobody even likes her</br>  <br><br>I was laughably trying to cut back and she was going to be another expensive one. I'll probably regret it once I get Yamato, assuming she lives up to my expectations.<br><br>I also didn't get Re, that I'll almost certainly sort out, Wo is fantastic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Only these, which program do you use to merge the pictures?.</br>  <br>I'd say Honoka, Eli and Hanayo's are more boring.<br>At least Rin's fits her character and is adorable as fuck.<br>None of those are my ideal choices though.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't think that's a bad thing, it really brings out her cuteness.</br></br>  <br>Not exactly, but the mechanics are so simple that after a day of playing you won't need to look at translations again. <br>But I agree. As a game, it's not really worth playing.</br></br>  Going to Tokyo for a few days at the end of the month. What places should I hit up for figures and such? Is it even cheaper to buy things in Japan vs ordering them online?  <br>That's cute and all, but I normally display my figures with the back to the wall.</br>  <br><br>I literally don't have the space. I hate having more money than space.<br><br>But boy do they look good.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kotori, Maki and Nozomi all have better outfits in my opinion.</br>  <br>You can give some of the money to me, I have space.</br>  Can we expect any character development or are we just gonna see them between MC's interactions with the three fantasy girls?  Read the manga  I don't remember most of them in the manga and here they have a fucking lot of screentime in the anime even though lots of actual important characters in the manga don't have any.<br>Did they have more screentime in the novel ?</br>  <br> read </br>  <br>These colors don't read.</br>  <br><br><br>What do all those patches symbolize? 2nd Lieutenant is obvious, but what about the rest?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  I want the elven chick to wear jeans.  <br>Thanks anon</br>  <br><br>There's surprisingly little interaction between him and any of the girls except Rory.</br></br>  <br>She will when they cross back to grorious Nihon.</br>  <br>They really downgraded the uniforms.</br>  <br> letting women in infantry <br>Good thing the JSDF is built to never actually fight anything other than their own civilians and some fishing vessels.</br></br>  <br>Wait is Kuri seriously that small in the anime? In the manga she looked pretty built. Those arms.</br>  <br> tfw swedens military gender equality policy forces navy to have 50% women on-board </br>  <br>If the show is only about these military guys and girls, not including a goth-loli demi-goddess, a sorceress, and an elf, I think it would be much better.<br>I just want to see modern military wrecking fantasy army, I don't really care about those fantasy girls.<br> That's why I drop this anime </br></br></br>  <br>She's gonna wear human clothes? Sweet.<br>I always loved it in Stargate when aliens wore SGC/Atlantis uniforms and shit (like Teal'c or Teyla).<br><br> And I liked Jack using Jaffa staff weapons, I hope we'll get something similar here too. </br></br></br></br>  <br> women on a ship </br>  <br>They made her generic cute. Even if you go for the "women in infantry" thing it makes her look actually out of place in the anime. She actually looked like an actual soldier in the manga.</br>  <br>Read the Manga, it's probably more up your alley. The anime tried to make the characters cuter and focus more on the girls so they'd sell more figs and BDs</br>  <br> I don't really care about those fantasy girls. <br>Me neither, anon. But this ride looks promising and I'm willing to give it a chance. I just hope for at least some character development, because they really look like a cool bunch.</br></br>  <br>Are the military dudes in the manga relevant?<br>I doubt it because of what this anon said</br></br>  <br> FTL <br>Please no time travel</br></br>  <br>Fairly relevant throughout, although no one really gets any character development.</br>  manga phases out the squaddies completely and MC continues the recon with only moeblobs  <br>They're not main characters, but the Manga in general focuses more on the military aspects that the anime tries to downplay (probably to not send the message "guns are cool" to Japanese kids or whatever)</br>  <br>She looked like a soldier in the light novel art too. I don't know if she was ever on any of the covers for a novel art comparison.</br>  <br>Considering the original design of the prince I can hardly take the novel design seriously.</br>  <br><br>Any pic of them?</br></br>  <br>Tuka looks damn fine, at least.</br>  How could my gate adaptation look so bad when the monster girl adaptation is the best looking anime this season?    <br>I imagine they'll have to if they're trimming out the rape/gore/working girls.</br>  I really liked this part, shame we won't be seeing this old baller again for a while.      <br> That's why I drop this anime <br>It always amazes me what utterly pedantic reasons people will drop a show over.</br></br>      <br>It's gonna be epic the moment they actually need to do anything.</br>  <br>I liked it too, until they had him laugh like a loon, that trope of breaking down gets on my nerves</br>  <br>I see the Japanese really want their empire back. Too bad they'd be vaporized by Chinese nukes.</br>    let's be lucky we even got this to be animated at all. If we tried to adapt Gate in its purest form...    <br>Modern expansion just doesnt work, because the most valuable land is sat on by powerful countries with literal super weapons, best anyone can do is pick on the small nations under the guise of keeping order</br>    <br>They look better than the women on board the ship I'm on.</br>    <br>It would be too awesome for the squints to handle</br>    <br>Now dumping side stories.</br>    <br>That's all I have.</br>  Be honest with me, does this turn to moe moe haremshit? Or does it go towards more politics and world exploring?  <br> Not showing the back cover of Itami's fantasy harem not very happy about Pina hogging Itami all to herself </br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br> none of the soldierbros appearing on the covers <br>So it was a regular harem LN with 3 magical girls? There goes the character development.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Japanese military propaganda, preparing the population for World War 3.</br>  <br>we want the moeshit crowd.</br>  <br>Well done, old chap.</br>  <br>warui</br>  i have a feeling the mc is a self insert.  <br>Might as well upload all of them.</br>  <br>what a drama queen.</br>  <br>That's it.</br>  <br>Holy shit, he becomes a Dragon Knight in the end?</br>  <br> Dark Elf with an RPG <br> Sorceress doing the driving <br><br>I'm not sure if that's a good idea</br></br></br></br>  <br>you are missing one from the gaidens.</br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  How far will the anime will go storywise? Yao has a voice, so right before the Flame Dragon assault arc?  <br>Wait. The gate explodes when it closes? Why is it so ruined?</br>  <br>yes he does.<br><br>dark elf becomes a firm believer in modern earth firearms and explosives. and the sorceress wants to learn everything about technology, machines and physics she probably will be able to cause nuclear fission using magic.</br></br></br>  <br>read the LN.</br>  <br>Slow down there, lad. Don't be making bold claims like that.</br>  <br>I hate it when they do it. What's the point of showing all these characters with their ranks like its important if they're just gonna appear in the background?</br>  <br>they blew it up to stop bad things from happening.</br>  <br>Some of them are important.<br>Also, they are important in a sense that Itami cares about them.</br></br>  <br> gonna be epic <br><br>Holy fuck leave faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Tomita is one lucky sonnovabitch</br>  <br>/pol/ should go and stay go</br>  According to everything in this thread and those covers this shit actually looks like something decent. A shame it's just gonna be a short season and then will be forgotten because of the low sales.  <br><br><br> Summerclaps </br></br></br>  oh dear, I can imagine it now: within a few decades, the Gate world turns into a mishmash of Warcraft/Warhammer40k/Mad Max/Borderlands/Zardoz  Damn, Im in tears watching them getting rekt by jsdf,its not that great but its what we got.  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YOR<wbr>OvO2fxTc</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Just wondering<br>But what rank was MC before he got promoted?</br></br>    <br>  harem <br>Mage is a bro who is too young for him anyway.<br>Elf's relation is litterally of a father-daughter.<br>Meanwhile, Rory's ship is already confirmed and real as he became his servant by blood link.<br><br>There is no harem.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There is no harem. <br> no harem <br>Anon pls.</br></br></br>  <br> Mage is a bro who is too young for him anyway. <br>Shooks, I wanted to root for her, but whatever. She's still cute as hell.</br></br>  <br><br>NOW I'VE LOST IT<br><br>I KNOW I CAN KILL<br><br>THE TRUTH IS JUST BEYOND THE GATE</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I just want to say that singing cartoon theme songs on the comm is a time honored tradition.<br>Unless you're in the armored corps, and then you just jury-rig your mp3 player to the intercom.</br>  <br>I realized that depending what parts of manga you accent. Feminist can latch to it as dream pro women story or jump on it as spawn of patriarchal devil. <br><br>/pol/ should stop shitposting about it and do some work to see if you can make feminist fanatically like and hate same story.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah they would be boned.</br>  <br> harem <br> Lelei daughterzoned <br> Tuka literally daughterzoned <br><br>only Rory gets shipped and the dark elf is just kinda there</br></br></br></br></br>  I'm totally digging the ED. Sounds like 90's J-pop.  <br>Feel free to root for her, she thinks they're married anyway. <br><br>Also I can't stand those half covers.</br></br></br>  <br>The Prince never showed up on any of the novel art, they're just covers after all, are you talking about the LN art? If so I agree he looks way off there.</br>  I hope they don't cut out the Ride of Valkyrie part.  <br><br>Mage gets jealous when other girls are too close to Itami and she's left alone (check bonfire with dark elf). <br>Elf got past her "daddy" stuff and now calls him daddy in a different way<br>Dark elf wants the dick<br>Rory wants the dick</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope they use same Warsaw Symphonic version in anime.</br>  <br>that wouldn't be a copyright issue would it? Because it's similar to the movie?</br>  <br>That would be nice</br>  <br> Dark elf wants the dick <br>Too bad Itami really couldn't give less of a shit about her, it's not until one of the later gaiden parts that he finally takes enough interest to wonder where she's staying/sleeps.</br></br>  <br><br>What's this one about? Where is Rory and the rest?</br></br>  <br>Firearms can be used without the need for male upper body strength.</br>  <br>i'd let that kuribayashi smash my face,<br>if you know what i mean</br></br>  <br><br>The fact that they are using this old guy for an MC means that we are probably safe from that stuff.</br></br>  <br>I sure hope you're right, anon.</br>  <br>2nd lt in the novels, promoted to 1st. Here who knows, NCO most likely.</br>  <br> Kuribayashi </br>  <br>Is there a new GATE novel being made?</br>  <br>Supposedly season 2 of the novels is going to start soon. I think the LN version is almost done adapting all the gaidens too so maybe they're waiting for the LNs to finish season 1 first?</br>  <br>I would but I can't read Japanese.</br>  did /ak/ ever actually TL the novels? All i can find is the mango which is just finished with flame dragon arc.   kill 100k people <br> try to establish friendly relationships <br>Sounds like a good plan.</br></br>  <br>depends which novels you wanted. the super sad WN novels, the new 'official' light novels, or the upcoming 'season' that covers what happens when the JSDF regain contact?</br>  <br>wait what do you mean the 'super sad' novel? <br><br> did something bad happen in the original novels? I know both the original and the new LN went up to volume 5 where the gate closes </br></br></br>  <br>The country folk most likely don't have much in common with, or care about what the city folk and military think. As far as they're concerned, the men in green are dealing with threats like flame dragons that their own country isn't protecting them from.</br>  <br> Shit, we want to end the first episode just before this rly kewl fight begins but there's half an episode left <br> Let's just put some filler there lol hehe  <br>This show is fucking trash. You'd think A-1 learned from SAO that just having a good first episode is enough to rake in fucking loadsamone.</br></br></br>   OTP <br>Soon.</br>  <br>You missed the original published novels, the LNs came after the manga version. <br><br><br>The original webnovel version had quite a few bad ends for some characters.</br></br></br></br>  <br>and the new Light Novel changes those bad ends?<br> who had a bad end please tell me itami at least got with rory <br><br>the Ln isn't even over is it? volume 5 isnt the last, aren't there more coming in?</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the LN is just an adaptation of the published novels, it's the webnovel version that had bad ends.</br>  <br>killing 100k soldiers and killing 100k civilians are two diffrent things as much as you would like to argue about it</br>  <br>An army of 100k medieval soldiers usually consists majorly not of people from the city but of peasons drafted in from the villages.<br><br>They probably killed all of the male population. <br><br>But who gives a shit, the SDF is the friend of the people! Join the SDF!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Wants to know what happens <br> Doesn't read manga <br> posts worthlessly on /a/ <br>Kill yourself faggot</br></br></br></br>  <br> An army of 100k medieval soldiers usually consists majorly not of people from the city but of peasons drafted in from the villages. <br>They were trained soldiers, not country yokels. It's possible they drafted a bunch of people, but I doubt it, they usually don't draft soldiers for what they expect to be an easy battle.</br></br>   older guy who only joined the military to support his otaku nature <br> tasked to diplomatically reach out to the savage natives instead of just glassing them <br> saving terrorized elven maidens and meeting female warriors who get moist realizing his overwhelming force <br> tribals give him waifus as translators and as please don't kill us oh mighty one gifts <br><br>i dunno, man</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>but guns are cool</br>  Im surprised they made Piña so flat and plain. She was much more endowed and curvy in the manga, even if she seemed plain when she was wearing armor.<br><br>Each time she was in her classical togas, she looked fine.<br><br>Im also a bit annoyed about how they cuti-fied everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, up to the emperor</br></br></br></br>  <br>...I'm sorry, I am actually hyped about this, if only because the soldiers had zero development so I felt nothing for them.<br><br>I know its wrong, sorry</br></br></br>  <br>Sounds pretty good to me.</br>  <br>I think they're just following the LN designs (which came after the manga.</br>  <br>It's really too bad they didn't just adapt the manga designs, the manga designs are perfect for pretty much everyone.</br>  <br>Oh God please do not let them moeify Ride of the Valkyries, and keep them from turning it into J-pop.<br><br>Amen</br></br></br>  Here's one more picture for the Gaiden plus novel that was released recently.  <br>Well yeah. I know that and you know that, but the nips don't know that.</br>  <br>I had the impression that the old man was the highest ranked of Itami's subordinates.</br>  <br>Judging by the picture he probably is.</br>  <br>The left insignia is of a higher rank than the right one. Maybe they should be swapped?</br>  <br>more than likely.</br>  <br>who gets the bad ends?<br><br>I can't sleep till I know<br> <br>pls let Rory be safe</br> </br></br></br></br>  <br>In the webnovel? Basically everyone. Don't worry about it that much, the webnovel is completely not related to the novel/manga/light novel story.</br>  Am i the only one who feels that a bishoujo harem for an old dude it's just wrong and probably wish fulfillment of the author?  <br>Sure. But that's not this show.</br>  <br><br>This thread is making me believe otherwise...</br></br>  <br>And you believe everything people tell you?</br>  <br>Except he does though, Itami might not reciprocate any of the girls' feelings but they all do like him.</br>  <br>I know that but not knowing bothers me<br><br>fuck<br><br>sum it up for me  pls? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its super dramatic after ch 20 or so I was kinda disappointed with the whole Elf's arc.</br>  <br>Two cours anon!</br>  Anyone laugh when the JSDF just blew the enemy army away?<br><br> Army decides to attack at night <br>I was just praying they'd get blown away and it was great...</br></br></br>  <br>Both sad and funny at the same time.</br>  <br><br>No, but official art does not help.</br></br>  <br><br>Like most MCs.</br></br>  <br> Soon. <br>Literally months away.</br></br>  <br> probably wish fulfillment of the author <br>It's almost like the author was an otaku in the SDF himself.</br></br>  <br>afaik no one has translated either the original novels or the light novels.</br>  <br>Besides that conspicuous dickslot they put into her armor design I'm actually fine with the changes.</br>   yfw it's revealed that Risa wants to get back with Itami because   he's hung like a horse.   How many episodes is this supposed to be again? It seems they're moving pretty quickly through the beginning bits.  <br>24</br>  <br> character development <br><br>For some characters, but not MC or the significant JSDF members (MC's division and a couple of others). Although I only read the manga, I imagine he ends up changing a bit  following the gates temporary closure . Kind of unfortunate really, I'd add alot to series if it was one of the focuses (Could swap out the brief politics stuff with it and everyone would be happy).<br>Plenty of relationship development though (for everyone but MC, who intentionally restrains himself like most Harem MC, he comes close to having sex with Rori, but author cockblocks him at the last moment).</br></br></br></br>  <br>They've gone through two manga chapters in the first two episodes, it's not an unusual pace.<br><br>If it keeps this pace, the first 24 eps will end right as they all return from their Japan trip, with ample material left over.</br></br></br>  Does the Japanese army actually have women on the front lines? It seems very unrealistic.  <br>I don't think so. But for a recon unit if might be a different thing.</br>  <br><br>And if they do, are they as hot as Kuribayashi.  And if they are, are they single? </br></br>  <br>Not really, in real life, they would have a military desk job rather than actually invade foreign territory.</br>  <br>cute though</br>  <br>Yeah, but even if it was a recon mission, its still an alien fantasy world.<br><br>If I were in charge, I consider attaching doctors or at least some pathology experts in case any units start getting sick because they caught a new disease that affects humans but only remained in the fantasy world until now.<br><br>Sending women to the front lines of an alien dimension just doesn't make sense at all.<br><br>If a women has to be sent, it should only be nurses or other medical professions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If it keeps this pace, the first 24 eps will end right as they all return from their Japan trip, with ample material left over. <br>That's exactly where I expect it to end. They showed Lelei talking to the Diet and Rory at the resort about to fuck shit up. It's a good place to wrap up a season.</br></br>  <br> Japanese army <br> anyone on the front lines <br>lol</br></br></br>   gate to another world appears <br> rush in and immediately start slaughtering innocents <br>I have no words for how stupid these people are. The scene in episode 2 where they're trying to figure out just what the fuck is going on really pissed me off.

Series would be good if it went fullblown invasion lasting half a year with a good amount of losses of the japanese side due to foreign intervention and natural threats IE more dragons, wizards, and aids.<br><br>Or fullblown fantasy harem about Itami fucking the daughters of the leaders of the different racial kingdoms to become the first Japanese President, elected by the power of dick, of the new world.</br></br>  <br> This will never become a reality </br>  <br> Japanese President, elected by the power of dick, of the new world. <br>Through dick, unity?</br></br>  <br>Reminder that this anime does not have a big tits, JSDF womanlet CC fighter and thus is shit</br>  <br>It does, they've just butchered her character design to the point she's unrecognizable.</br>  <br>That is not a Kurebayashi, that is a SHIT</br>  <br>She's wearing camo so they're kind of hard to see, but they're still there.</br>  <br>webms of the massacre where?</br>  remember not to watch HS, terrible banding<br>wait for sushit</br>  <br>Did they get his rank right in the subs?</br>  <br>Hmm, with all this funi shit, I wonder if fan subbing will come back.</br>  Anyone got a gif/webm of Pinya being all flustered? Best part of episode 2.  Fantasy world fucked up.<br><br>Should have sent elephants instead of small sized dragons.<br><br>Even with modern artillery, a charging rampaging elephant is still pretty hard to kill.<br><br>Fantasy elephants would be 5 to 10 times larger than our elephants as well.<br><br>Also, Fantasy Hippos would be scary to face as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Even with modern artillery, a charging rampaging elephant is still pretty hard to kill. <br>I don't think you appreciate the munitions they were sending downrange buddy</br></br>  <br>No send in fantasy scorpions, spiders, and snakes wrapped in blankets with the black plague.<br><br>Or prostitutes with stds.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, Fantasy Insects would be a nightmare as well since the only thing stopping Insects genociding Earth is the fact that oxygen levels keep them small sized.</br>   mfw obliterating fantasy savages,   <br>It's the anime. Their is no massacring. Just destroyed land.</br>  <br>aw, why did they take away the togas?</br>  <br>Because it's A-1 Pictures and they don't like gore/violence/sexual things.</br>  <br><br>Doesn't anime Pinã look like LN Pinã?</br></br>  <br>That's her Knight armor. They exchanged stupid sculpted tit plates for cleavage windows. It's an upgrade.</br>  <br><br>I would have sent giant centipedes because those fuckers move fucking fast.<br><br>Just imagine fantasy centipedes.<br><br>The Japs would piss themselves.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this is bullshit</br>  <br>and somehow every character except kuribayashi gets my dick hard</br>  <br>I'd be surprised if they showed any rape. It's the only thing that gets my dick hard.</br>  <br>If you notice the first episode the only part that shows any form of death is when the MC stabs a guy and they pan out so you only hear that generic death sound.</br>  <br>Even if that was so, LN came after the manga or novel.</br>  <br>Where's big titty girl? Wasnt she a sargeant?</br>  <br>Actually, it seems she looks like that in manga too. Its her battle attire. They just gave her one design.</br>    <br>She is the brown-haired girl.</br>  <br>Damn moe shit in anime ruining characters.</br>  <br>If you mean the one with a close quarters combat badge, its the Genki middle schooler with brown hair and her arm up.<br><br>The Anime continues to ruin characters</br></br></br>  Is it common to erect barbed wire that fucking far from your base?<br><br>Like that barbed wire was at least 2 to 3 miles away from the Jap's base.<br><br>Is this a common thing to do?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not a boob window on that knight armor, the design on the chest plate makes it seem like it in the manga.</br>  <br>Yes. I mean, depends on a couple of factors, but that's not that strange.</br>  <br><br>It's so satisfying to watch.</br></br>  <br>and concertina wire will fuck your shit up. I was kind of looking forward to watching the soldiers try to deal with it, but they skipped over it.</br>  <br>The anime is literally ruining everything. The atmosphere is completely fucked during battles. The director can't into mood. Plus cancer faggots keep saying that the anime is good.</br>  I hate anime Rory.  <br>Congrats.</br>  <br>they literally have one fucking job, and that's doing the Italica Siege right.</br>  <br>Why is it pedantic to drop a show because it's not going to be giving him the one factor that interests him about the concept?<br>He wants to see modern military strength wreck medieval armies and magic and dragons and shit, not get that interesting stuff shoved to the background in favour of pandering and fantasy girl harem antics in the army.</br></br>  A-1 ruining everything once again.<br><br>I feel so bad because the source material is quite good.</br></br>  <br>  how dare someone enjoy this show! <br><br>I don't like it either, but simmer down bud</br></br></br>  <br>Fucked up flecktarn meets woodland, the camo.</br>  <br>their one job is to ruin gate.</br>  <br> good-looking character slutified to sell figmas <br>Into the trash immediately.</br></br>  <br>I'm just enraged everytime I think about this anime. It's one of the few animes I wanted to enjoy and looked forward to. I also can't stop watching it and being even more enraged.</br>  Dragons are pretty tanky.<br><br>Not one Jap brings back dragon scales for scientists to analyze despite the fact our scientists study shit like spider webs to learn how to make better armor and shit.<br><br>I thought Japs were Monster Hunter fans yet everyone of them don't care about monster loot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But they managed to get Itami's troll attitude just right.</br>  <br>Imperial tamed wyvern aren't dragons and yes, they collected samples</br>  <br> Not one Jap brings back dragon scales for scientists to analyze <br>Do we know this for sure? How do we know the story just decided not to explicitly focus on this aspect?</br></br>  I wanted more slaughter and mainly questinoing, the raw power of apache, shilkas, tanks and artillery.<br>I think they are trying to conserve this and use it to make a battle later even more epic.<br><br>Funny thing is I started watching Owari no Seraph, just because of that one scene with Apaches.<br>Thank god at least GATE gave me something to enjoy, that is not a gay shonen anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br> JSDF <br> Apaches <br> shilkas </br></br></br>  <br>It's the vehicular diversity, that the Japanese crave for so much.</br>  <br>The JGSDF operates both Cobras and Apaches.</br>  <br>Yes finding a decent voice actor and just needing to copy lines from the LN or manga, i'd hope they'd get something right.</br>  <br>The Italica Crisis will probably be what you want.<br><br> Fairly large chopper group absolutely fucks up an army of marauders raiding a nearby town. </br></br></br>  <br> yfw they cut it down to a few helicopters and no gore </br>  <br>Probably be CG choppers destroying the ground around the enemy making them jump and disappear without a trace except for like 1 or 2 for visual effects.</br>  <br><br> yfw they cut it down to a few helicopters and no gore <br><br>I'll probably drop it right there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know that's going to happen right?</br>  <br>thank god</br>  <br>It's more about a far more advance civilization interacting with a far less enlightened one. The manga put more focus on the nobility being inhuman and amoral by our modern standards.</br>  <br>The manga and light novel is about politics and world exploring while the anime is going to be about moe moe haremshit with the side plot of politics and world exploring.</br>  <br>You should expect another edit in the future.</br>  <br>Well, considering the Emperor scorched earth everything between Alnus Hill and the capital, locals shouldn't have too many warm fuzzies for him either. All they might know is that there's an army of green uniformed men who could squash 'em like bugs. Might as well make nice to 'em.</br>  <br> SAO, good first episode <br>Seriously though, there's "good self contained pilot" and in GATE's case, it's "build up of anticipation for next ep". Given the source material, they're gonna have to structure things differently from a conventional anime.</br></br>  <br><br>This.<br><br>I doubt that the military is very popular. If any of them come from the villages, they're most likely seen as traitors, willing to oppress their own family and friends for a paycheck. If some of them get shot up after being drafted, they'd probably get more angry at the belligerent empire for putting them in that situation than at their enemy who stands a chance of ending this bullshit altogether.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Their's no build up because the director can't into mood. Seriously the anticipation is destroyed because of this. Feels unnatural. It's like instead of blowing up a balloon and popping it, the person sticks a needle while the balloon is still being filled up.</br>  <br>does it kill you to post the back cover?</br>  <br>Well, except there hasn't been any fantasy girls yet. We get a "vision" in ep 1 and only just saw the elf at the very end of ep 2. And he's saying he's dropping it because there's too much pandering.<br><br>Meanwhile, the actual anime focuses way more on the combat and slaughter than even the manga. Granted, there's a lot of discretionary shots.</br></br></br>  <br>Indeed. Take for instance the scene with the doctor/whore. It wasn't focused on before because it wasn't pivotal to the main story and there's only so many aspects you can talk about. But yeah, seems the ministry of health's involved.</br>  <br>Here you go anon. I got that picture from Amazon so it only had the front cover.</br>  <br> Most of Pina's female knight order died <br> Bozes was one of the lucky few to survive and was later happily married to Tomita and had a child together <br><br>If only the other knights had the same luck as Bozes.<br><br>Seem like Pina is busy with the Empire's 'grand reopening'</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Short hair still betrays her childhood friend because the D was too good. </br>  <br>Go away Stephen King</br>  How can you guys watch this? The lack of gore makes it so tamed compared to the manga.  <br>For me it's more about the military and the wow factor of the natives. I could watch this trope forever.</br>  <br>I'm not really sure what gore would add. Then again I read the manga so even if its not show implicitly, in my head I still get the full picture. <br><br>Maybe anime only people do end up missing something. Still, I'm not sure it really is all that important, unless people want gore just for gore's sake.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm with you on that. Love that shit. But I don't like how the anime doesn't do the action justice.</br>  <br>It would die out pretty soon. You need to ration it throughout the show.<br>If you keep massacring them and they will still get surprised, it will start getting ridiculous.<br><br>That's why they toned down the initial fights in my opinion.</br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4cx<wbr>yltqgt4E</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Your reaction to this guy?</br></br>  <br>He's an idiot like always.</br>  <br><br>Not clicking the link. <br><br>I really don't care what some probably obnoxious youtuber thinks of Gate. If you want drama centered around random blogs and videos, head over to /v/.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit taste that's what.</br>  <br> Rory wants the dick <br>I thought she just wants his soul</br></br>  <br>She's already made a couple advances towards Itami.<br><br> One at the onsen, when she tried to relieve her arousal from the fighting by seducing Itami. <br><br> Another was at the PX, when she was trying to get Itami drunk so she could have her way with him, but Yao interrupted. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>   One at the onsen, when she tried to relieve her arousal from the fighting by seducing Itami.<br/> <br>you mean the kidnappers shootout?</br></br>  <br>Yep, she gets all worked up, and there's only two ways of relieving it.<br><br>One of them is killing people.</br></br></br>  <br>If only more people were like you, anon.</br>  <br>Why doesn't she just relieve herself by masturbating?</br>  <br> that shit taste <br> that retardation <br>I don't know why I watched it.</br></br></br>  <br>Because she didn't want to masturbate and did want to fuck Itami.</br>  So considering the developments in the recent chapters, what are the odds of Rory ending up with mc?  <br>In fact, some of them actually have more developments than Itami himself. <br> <br>Kurata and his catgirl fetish lands him a catgirl girlfriend, and he is seen in many situations interacting with monstergirls<br><br>Tomita serves as Itami's right-hand man in most situations, mutually falls in love with one of Pina's knights, and marries her. He becomes the first interdimentional marriage between the two worlds. <br><br>Furuta actually develops a bond with one of the prime antagonists of the story, and become her light in the shadows. Unfortunately it does not end well for both. <br><br>Kuribayashi and Kurokawa both have lots of screentime, especially Kuri. Kurokawa's role as voice of reason and abuse of Itami is a running joke, as well as Kuri's bad luck getting a man. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br>  <br><br>She also did this, which amused me</br></br>   morons who read only 40% story think they know how characters are developed <br><br>The manga is only through with 2 out of the 5 books for fucks sake, stop talking like you know everything</br></br>  <br>She's not very shy when it comes to Itami.<br><br>I mean, the first thing she does when they meet is sit on his lap.</br></br></br>  <br> Three dead people on cover <br><br>Why <br>Why do they do this</br></br></br></br>  一番初めの画像はコーヒーの分量だ  <br>I thought she just teased him: "This is what you missed"</br>  Is this a modern representation for the Mongol invasion of the Roman Empire?  <br>Are you implying defending your borders from marauding armies are the same thing as invading the whole fucking world?</br>  How old is Itami?  <br>MAN GOD MACHINE</br>  <br>33 at the start of the series, 37~38 by end of gaiden</br>  <br>there are no Finns in this though.</br>  <br> female soldiers <br>Fucking dropped.</br></br>  <br><br>I always found odd that MCs are either 13-20 or 30++<br><br>It's like the 20-30 age gap is mostly ignored.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Except that firing a gun is far from the only thing a soldier needs to do.</br>  <br>Assuming they didn't give the women any special treatment and they managed to get through the necessary training to qualify as soldiers, there's not much wrong with having them serve.<br><br>While it's true that the vast majority of women simply aren't up to the standards of most modern-day forces, if the few of them that can meet the standards do, then good on them for overcoming their inherent disadvantages.</br></br></br>  <br>You got triggered.</br>  <br><br>There are women who are physically fit and can handle military service.<br>Not a lot of them, but it's not impossible—it doesn't require lowering the standards of the military at all; just weed out the people who can't handle it. We do this for men trying to join the military too.</br></br></br>  <br> There's no MCs in their 20s <br><br>Just off the top of my head, these are all anime airing in 2015<br><br> Gintama <br> One Punch Man <br> Denpa Kyoshi <br> Utawarerumono 2 <br> BBB (Likely, Leo's age isn't stated) <br> Young Black Jack <br> Monster Musume <br><br>It's not as rare as you might think.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well, pretty much this, i always complained about the whole ''stronk womyn in the army'', but i mainly complained because many armies lower they standards to let them pass, if they manage to pass the same test as the men's then i don't have much of a problem, but the problem of that is that suddenly they would be way too few women making all the special expenses just for them like sanitaty supplies for example an unnecesary extra bother, also i once read from a irak veteran about how they tend to disrupt the unit cooperation and how the rest of the unit end up ignoring procedures when a women falls injured or is about to get captured, they try to help them way more desperately in situations where if it were a man the one injured they would proceed like their training tells them to</br>  <br>This is incorrect, most of the named characters did survive. <br> <br>Survived: Pina, Bozes, Vifeeta, Hamilton, Panache (traitor), Gray<br>Died: Norma, Shandy, Suissess<br/></br></br> </br></br>    <br>The empire is a lot bigger than you think. <br>This isn't some stereotypical medieval french nation, this is like a Roman Empire combined with Mogols level of territory.</br></br>  <br> having problems with Kuribayashi Shino </br>  <br><br>Half of those animes are obscure and in the other half MCs are drawn like (and act like) teenagers anyway.</br></br>  <br> Monster Musume <br><br>Kimihito is actually 18.</br></br></br>  <br>The last thing they needed to do was intercept a Russian submarine, violating national waters in the Baltic, the Finns dropped depth charges on but they dropped electronic signs in the water saying that "welcome to Sweden: we're gay"<br>http://www.theguardian.com/world/20<wbr>15/may/13/swedish-peace-group-troll<wbr>s-russian-submarines-with-gay-defen<wbr>ce-system</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>   Shit character designs <br> Censored with a lot of good scenes left out already when it's barely even started <br> Awful animation <br>How can they fuck up an adaptation this bad?</br></br></br>  <br> implying Gintoki and Saitama are obscure, and that they are drawn like teens <br><br>Can you try harder than this?</br></br></br>  <br>He join after looking for work awhile after uni. So he joined when he was 21/22/23 at most.</br>  <br> How can they fuck up an adaptation this bad? <br>Lots of practice and giving it their all.</br></br>  <br> Gintama <br> One Punch Man <br> Young Black Jack <br><br> obscure <br> teen <br><br>- Gintama is a multi-million copy selling shounen manga serialized in the best selling magazine in all of Japan. <br>- OPM is the biggest hit web comic in history of the medium, and recently hit the milemark of five million copies, cementing itself as one of the most successful new seinen manga in Japan.<br>- Do I need to even explain Black Jack? The name is so huge, not a single Japanese citizen is ignorant of the name.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But most of the Order are mostly unnamed and died</br>  <br>Yeah but who cares about cunts with no name or character development. They're just numbers, like the soldiers that died in this episode. With boobs.</br>  <br><br><br>Oh but they do, the only reason that they look old to you it's because you are probably kids.<br><br>And you mentioned the popular ones not the other half.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's A-1, what did you expect?</br></br>  <br>Just watched the two episodes out for this. So far it's 10/10. I want to see the Emperor get #rekt, and more badassery like the commander who just wanted to shoot an arrow.</br>  <br> ALL DAT FUCKING SHIT TASTE </br>  <br>If I were on a mission to recon and negotiate with savges, I'd want to have as many cute, young, friendly looking women with me as I could.<br><br>It would help breaking the ice, as they showed on episode 2.</br></br></br>  Does this ever turn into something other than a one-sided massacre? What does king Dipshit think scorched earth tactics are going to do against mechanized infantry with access to roads?  <br>Yes.<br>Right, the King is supposed to know exactly what vehicles are as soon as a foreign invading force crosses the gate. Good job.</br></br>  <br>Read the fucking manga. It's great.</br>  <br>Well, the anon  you just answered to may have said something stupid, but its also true that with such losses being suffered the emperor should at least be more wary, try to know more and stop sending armies until he knows more, yeah okay, in last chapter the armies he sent were those of his vassal states as to weaken them so they don't revolt, but he should have already realized there is something extremely wrong when with such numerical advantage they still haven't achieved anything, haven't read the LN so it's just deduction but it looks like the emperor is so useless and delusional that he thinks all this it's his subordinates fault and that it will be fixed eventually through the raw military might of the empire</br>  <br><br>Then what's with all the harem/otaku pandering vibes in the OP?</br></br>  <br>Gotta amp it up for the sales and self-insert factor.</br>  <br>Making accurate report of any kind was an impossible task in BC time. He only knows his men were defeated but has no idea as to why.<br><br><br>It's one sided massacre but with a twist. <br>A modern army is organized to defeat another modern army. What this implies is JSDF does not have the capacity to occupy the enemy territory, thus unable to end the war. They cannot go roman style and just butcher people but without that, they end up looking after millions of people. <br>The real war in the field of diplomacy, social engineering and getting money somehow as real wars always are.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Making accurate report of any kind was an impossible task in BC time. He only knows his men were defeated but has no idea as to why. <br>exactly what i meant, with those numbers he should realize something's wrong<br>exactly what i meant, even if he doesn't believe the reports of metal monesters and stuff he should realize there has to be something</br></br></br>  <br>It only happens during downtime(even then its not much) though with the changes they'll be making I won't be surprised if they dial it up a few notches especially if they still want whiny leftist netizen bux.</br>  <br>He sure knows but it's either you kill or get killed. Letting your enemy clean up your domestic concerns like rebellious vassal states is no bad either.<br>I have to say the author's portrayal of the gate world is too grime though. The real romans were brutal but the gate world savages and the empire are worse to the point they would likely rot to death.</br></br>  <br> exactly what i meant, even if he doesn't believe the reports of metal monesters and stuff he should realize there has to be something <br>Here is something you had to realise; something got lost in the cultural clash. The Emperor assumed that if the JSDF was truly that powerful, they could have attacked the Empire's Capital straight away. Because that's what he would have done.<br><br>JSDF didn't try to invade and conquer because they didn't have the mandate and also they don't want to deal with rebuilding a crushed society. But that concept is alien to the Emperor. The Emperor assumed that the only reason the JSDF is still camping around the Gate, is because they are not as strong as they seemed. The Emperor mistaken JSDF's reservations as a sign of weakness.<br><br>The Japanese representatives behave diplomatically and speaks softly. The Empire's diplomats scream threats and boast about their own invincibility. This natural difference meant that the Empire outright refused to believe JSDF is strong.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The JSDF isn't there to "#rekt"</br>  <br> According to everything in this thread and those covers this shit actually looks like something decent <br>PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFTTTTTTTT</br></br>  <br> implying they didn't summon it <br> implying they just had a standing army laying around doing nothing to send in <br><br>Nigga it was a planned invasion. They didn't expect any defense.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I feel so bad because the source material is quite good. <br>It's not.</br></br>  <br><br>Well, that's my opinion.<br><br> Faggot. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> 33 y o guy <br> Self Insert </br></br></br>  <br>Harem automatically makes it S/I territory.</br>  I'm surprised nobody has made any webms of episode two  Why is everyone in this anime a retard?<br><br>Of all the people beyond the gate so far, only one of them had the brains to realise something was wrong, but instead of retreating when the night assault failed he just did the exact same thing he saw fail, twice, by rushing in like a moron even though he knows the result of such a thing is tens of thousands of troops die before they can even get in range of the enemy.<br><br>It's ridiculous.</br></br></br></br>  <br> armchair general thinks that not!Romans know how to effectively deal with cartridge firearms </br>  <br>It's exactly because he knew it was fruitless that he did it. He was going to die and he wanted to try and hit at least 1 instead of resigning himself to defeat. Less armchair next time.</br>  <br> Moron thinks people hundreds of years ago are as stupid as he is, and don't have the pattern recognition to realise running at this encampment will kill them all, even though that was what resulted the first two times. </br>  <br>Ancient Mariner.txt</br>  within a few years the Gate world becomes a composite of Mad Max/Borderlands/Zardoz/Warhammer 40k  <br> Hey guys, instead of running right at this group, even though we've seen it fail twice and slaughter tens of thousands, why don't we call in a fucking dragon, or some magic users, and try to figure out a new tactic to deal with this problem. </br>  <br>dragons get cut down by AA fire, the only ones that can resist it are wild ancient dragons<br><br>magic users are extremely rare because magic is extremely difficult to master</br></br></br>  <br> ! <br>Back to fanfiction.net with you.</br></br>  Which subs should I download?<br><br>I want to believe that there's a better alternative than HorribleSubs..</br></br>  <br> images <br>newfag or?</br></br>  <br>Which would take days or weeks to get the necessary equipment and bring it back and then they'd be shredded by AA.

Send a tank division or two rolling into the capital and get boots on the ground in the capital's administrative and business districts.

She finds no sexual attraction to any other male. <br>In the first gaiden, bunch of handsome looking elves tried to win her heart, but due to her above sexual preference none of them looked attractive in her eyes. <br><br> The handsome elves ended up getting drunk and fucking the mermaids, and after the massive orgy they became betrothed to all the mermaids they fucked, thereby leaving Tuka alone forever.<br><br>And the orgy was all Itami's fault for unknowingly bringing super aphrodisiac booze.<br/></br></br> </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>   super aphrodisiac booze <br>I love shit like this</br></br>  <br> /pol/ </br>  <br>My memory is sketchy, but I think it was  Hamilton's ploy<br><br>To get Itami in the mood to fuck Pina, she gave the drink to either Itami or Pina, I forgot the details. <br>Anyways it ends up getting in the hands of mermaids and mermen, and they have orgy like crazy.

Also wondering whether Naoto is actually Ragna or not now since  it might endanger muh Rachel x Ragna ships if Raquel=Rachel theory is true ;_; <br><br>Also some source says that this is actually the last installment of BB (maybe from twitter or something?).</br></br></br>  NAOTO?! How the fuck? He shouldn't exist! He seriously shouldn't exist in this time frame!  <br>I'm positive they will explain it with some bullshit anyway.<br><br>Also he seems to be important to the plot so having his story to be done in the main game is better than finishing it in the novel where not many people read it.</br></br></br>  <br>Parallel worlds. <br>There's your answer.</br></br>  So will this be the sixth or seventh time i've bought this fucking game  <br>Technically this is the 4th installment storywise</br>  <br>I'm just so fucking tired of BlazBlue at this point</br>  <br>Maybe they simply haven't announced Mai yet and will do so later. Or she might be added to the console release. It's too early to conclude that she'll be DLC.</br>  <br>Guilty Gear is back.</br>  <br>Rachels new portrait makes her look so damn cute now.</br>  <br> Also some source says that this is actually the last installment of BB <br>I sure hope so. I had my fun with it but it really needs to be put to rest.</br></br>  <br>Mori has said that this installment will conclude Ragna's story. That doesn't necessarily mean that it will be the final game of the franchise.</br>  <br>We'll see them later, I assume Hibiki and Nine are mostly finished as we know there was data for them in CP and a few quotes. But the real kicker is that TERUMI AND HAZAMA ARE ALIVE! How the fuck are they alive? What the fuck does this picture mean? Mai,Kajun and Jubei better be shown soon</br>  <br>Yes. BB has been going on too long, unlike other fighting game franchises.</br>  <br> implying we won't get an extended version at some point </br>  <br>So chances are that Naoto guy is going to be the new MC or something?</br>  <br>God I hope not. He was such an annoying faggot in Bloodedge Experience and here it seems like all he wants to do is destroy Murakumos.</br>  Reposting from /vg/ thread https://twitter.com/tapioka_kana/me<wbr>dia . They also have translations of the trailer<br><br> rip ragna ;_; </br></br></wbr>  <br>They literally had plat and hazama stab each other and fall into a fucking lake. Those were the least confirmed deaths ever.</br>  <br>I think that Mai will be in the new game at some point. The fact they included Remix Heart in CPEX was to a large extent in order to introduce her (and Kajun) to the people who have only played the games, sort of how CP introduced Celica before she was made playable in CPEX.<br><br>Hazama and Luna never died; only Terumi and Trinity did so. Maybe they left Terumi as a playable character but he won't be in the story mode. Or perhaps he could appear in flashbacks to justify having him in.</br></br></br>  <br>Other series had better long-term planning than BB. BB has been a mess throughout it's relatively short life.</br>  Call me when the Extend is out.<br><br>Jesus christ, they're actually worse than Capcom with how often they're releasing shit. At least Capcom eventually decided to use patches.</br></br>  Where's my Alpha?  <br> Half of the cast <br> New game has new waifu nobody asked <br> Baiken never <br>Ishiwatari can choke on Mori's dick for copying him so much now, in the past was the reverse.</br></br></br></br>  <br>For someone who hasn't read the LNs can you elaborate on this theory?</br>  <br>All I want is Anji, is that too much to ask?</br>  Will Ragna finally get his well deserved happy ending this time?  <br> Ragna <br> Happy Ending <br>Choose only one option.</br></br></br>  Maybe Mai won't be in the new game, if they were hyping her up to be playable in CPEX, you'd think she would be in the reveal. Maybe Mai's shitty taste-buds and lack of Noel's cooking did kill her.  <br>Maybe Ragna will die and then Kokonoe will do what she did with ν-13 and pull his soul out of the Boundary and stick it into an old Murakumo unit. Thus producing the α-1 Murakumo that Mori has designed. Female Ragna could then live happily as Noel's, Makoto's and Tsubaki's new BFF.</br>  <br>No need to worry. Mori has said that Mai's adventures will continue and has drawn what she looks like at the time of the games.</br>  <br> Mori in charge of designs that don't look like shit <br><br>Why hasn't anyone put him in his place.</br></br></br>  <br>Mai is totally not gonna be playable now that we have Hibiki channeling Sho Minazuki with his two swords.</br>   Kohaku Hibiki <br> Not using Kohaku or Hibiki's moves. </br>  <br>Mai fights with a sword and parrying dagger rather than two swords though. And she also has her grimoire that might give her additional abilities.</br>  <br>God, I have an urge to bully you. /asg/ was right.</br>  <br>Just play leo. it's pretty much the same.</br>  <br>I don't even have CPE yet wtf.<br><br>Hype for nine though, that's fuckin sweet~<br><br>nine vs kokonoe mother daughter battle song when</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mai's moveset consists of cooking and kissing.</br>  <br>Also I doubt Mai's in the game when someone who hasn't been hyped at all or even known to people who only play the games is confirmed playable in the reveal, and Mai is not.</br>  <br>I want Mai to cook for me.<br><br><br>The console version won't even come out in Japan until 2017 and in the US until even later. CPEX will be the latest version for a fair bit of time.</br></br></br></br>  <br> her <br><br>That's still a man, even with magic sex change.</br></br></br>  <br>Just like Noel is still underage and Rachel is still a little girl. This game is kinda offensive when it comes to basic human biology, For fucks sake there's even bestiality and incest in it. Why isn't it rated AO or M?</br>  Reminder that Mai is a tranny and to filter autism maximum maiolev  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br>Mai was after all the protagonist of a 2 hour segment in BBCPE and also provided a system voice, which has been a first step for other characters along the path towards being made playable. And there was a phone strap of her being released alongside two other girls who are pretty popular and already playable. Considering the exposure Mai has received, and the fact she has an established fighting style and that a design for her after graduating has already been revealed.<br><br>Plus, there are a number of possible reasons for Mai appearing in the game. Mai's noble house was specifically mentioned in CP as being the only one that hasn't allied itself with Kagura, so she may be needed to help get the Hazuki family on Kagura's side. Another possibility is that her power which lets her read thoughts or memories could be of use to the protagonists for some reason. And of course she's a warrior so she could also help in that.</br></br></br>  <br>And yet Naoto had none of those things, and he's playable while she is not.</br>  <br>You know if youre sexually attracted to Mai that means youre gay right?</br>  <br>I'd say that you are jumping the gun. Just because it hasn't been announced that she's playable doesn't mean that she won't be.</br>  <br>But Rachel isn't human and Noel is Noel.</br>  <br><br>If they're showing off two nobodies that are going to be part of the main cast now, Mai will most likely be Day 1 DLC. <br><br>Amazing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's better to adopt a wait and see approach. No need to jump to conclusions.</br>  <br><br>It's not exactly jumping if they're willing to show off characters who have had no prior exposure to the series, but yet here they are. Face it, Mai will be DLC.</br></br>  I just want Ragna to have a happy ending, is that so much to fucking ask for.  <br>Technically Nine hasn't been officially announced either. And I doubt that they'd release a new version of the game with just 3 new characters. I remain optimistic.</br>  <br>For you.</br>  <br> And I doubt that they'd release a new version of the game with just 3 new characters <br><br>Do you know what company you're even talking about?</br></br></br>  <br>They've never done that except for EX versions</br>  <br>No kidding, Full price for just fucking Johnny and Jack-O in the new GG xrd game is disgusting.</br>  <br>I'm glad they are still sticking with 2D animation</br>  <br>CS had 4 new characters, CSE had 4 extra ones, CP had 5 new characters and CPE 3 extra ones. I doubt that there will only be 3 new characters in CF.</br>  <br>- No price has been announced yet<br>- There is a third new character that hasn't been revealed yet<br>- They will most likely add new characters for the console version like ArcSys does with pretty much all their games</br></br></br>  <br> They will most likely add new characters for the console version like ArcSys does with pretty much all their games <br>man i love dlc characters from the start</br></br>  Does the PS4 version of BBCPE look that much better then the PS3 one? <br><br>I'll probably grab either one when it hits bargain bin prices</br></br>  <br> CPE 3 extra ones <br>Let me stop you right there, Lambda 11 does not count as an extra character.</br></br>  <br>You mean Nine?</br>  <br>Sin is unlockable and Elphelt was a free download for a month.</br>  <br>I was refering to Kokonoe, Terumi and Celica.</br>  <br>When she had a different fighting style and move set, yes she does.</br>  <br>That's like saying Ken doesn't count as an extra character.</br>  <br>I was talking about Xrd. Nine is obviously the arcade boss that will be a timed release on arcade and available on console right away. Going by their past behavior you can expect the console version to have the three new arcade characters, one console unlockable character, one free DLC character and one paid DLC character.</br>  <br>Graphic's the same. Only loads so much faster.</br>  Is it going to be PS4 exclusive?  <br><br>This isn't an anime.</br></br>  <br>What pattern? That never happened in Continuum Shift. We got 3 at the start, 1 unlockable and 1 was time released DLC with the other 2 coming much later.</br>  Is Naoto someone I should know?  <br>I meant Arcsys pattern more than BB pattern, it's close to what happened with BBCP, P4AU and Xrd</br>  <br>It had anime and manga adaptations so it's fine to talk about it.</br>  <br>Plus we need you to stop littering /asg/ with cancer.</br>  <br>He was in one of the light novels</br>  <br>http://blazblue.wikia.com/wiki/Naot<wbr>o_Kurogane</wbr></br>  So....what are the odds Makoto will gain a command throw with her tail in this game?  <br>CP Arcade had 4 new characters<br><br>(Bullet, Amane, Azrael were playable at release, Izayoi was time-released boss)</br></br></br>  <br> Mai was after all the protagonist of a 2 hour segment in BBCPE and also provided a system voice, which has been a first step for other characters along the path towards being made playable.

Is this some more alternate timeline/parallel dimension shit?</br>  <br>Probably because he can turn into bloodedge and become similar to Ragna. With all the time paradox bullshit that happened to Ragna, it won't be surprising that he's actually Ragna.<br><br>Rachel did meet him in the past though and probably have some connections with him that we don't know yet.</br></br></br>  <br>"Hakumen -sama!"</br>    <br>It's rather funny that people initially shipped Jin and Mai. I guess due to their similarities to Ky and Dizzy.<br><br>Here's something similar at 1:12:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Kqb<wbr>SOWMHncM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br> jin/mai <br>that's almost as terrible as jin/noel</br></br>  Nice to know they're making Nine playable.<br>But now I want Trinity. Make it happen, Mori.</br>  <br>plat's the closest thing you can get</br>  <br>I want it to happen.<br>So I can finally drop Tsubaki</br></br>  <br> dropping justice <br>i'll drop my justice on you</br></br>  <br>The two couldn't work as a couple anyway, since Mai found Jin intimidating and he made her nervous, while Jin was Jin. I guess that Mai lucked out in the end though, as she fell in love with a guy who's genuinely nice rather than a misanthropic asshole.</br>  <br>Tag team was only ever an idea they were considering and not set in stone. I guess fan response wasn't good enough for them to go forward with it?</br>  <br>To bad Mai and Kajun don't do their voice things in character nor do they have a special way of saying anyone's names. Then again, neither do Makoto,Izanami or Noel.</br>  <br> Raquel=Rachel theory <br><br>Rachel and Raquel are both in those dumb books as completely separate people, what's the logic behind this?</br></br></br>  <br>Because Rachel is from the fucking future instead of the same timeline as Raquel?</br>  <br>Both of them do speak in character. E.g. Mai refers to Noel, Tsubaki and Makoto by just their first names, sounds confused by Mu and Izayoi and refers to Jin as "Kisaragi-senpai". (Kajun is similar and also says "Professor Kokonoe".)</br>  <br>Son, you really gotta learn how to spot bait. Then again, maybe you just like taking the bait because it gives you more oppurtunity to post pics and talk about Mai and or Kajun some more.</br>  <br><br>If Tsubaki had to choose between Hakumen-sama and Jii-nii-sama, who would she choose?</br></br>  Damn, that's a pretty sweet trailer. <br><br>I'm guessing Naoto is going to replace Ragna for the story mode while Ragna is "busy"</br></br>  <br>That'd still be strange considering Clavis actively "created" Rachel while Raquel was just "found" by him, and also Raquels ridiculously high life force compared to Rachel's lack of a life force.<br><br>If anything I expect Rachel to be some kind of robot based on Raquel.</br></br></br>  Fuck off.<br/>  <br>Posting that helps set the record straight so that people who haven't listened to their system voices but who simply read the thread can know the score.</br>  When did BB become a fujo game? Way too many dicks in the playable characters.  <br>Huh I can't find any source about Rachel 'created' by Alucard. I was under impression that the Alucard family is still mysterious and not much known about them until now. <br><br>From what I get, what we do know is that Clavis adopted Raquel and have a kid named Rachel. I found the information about Raquel's birth but none of Rachel's birth. Where did you get it?</br></br></br>  <br>I agree, Fuck this Naoto nigga. He has no fucking business slugging it out with Blazblue characters.</br>  I wish they could make ragna less gross.  <br>I'll fight you, you fuck.</br>  <br><br>Wait, are you guys seriously complaining about having too many male characters in a FIGHTING game? <br>Is even half the cast male at this point yet? The split was almost even last I checked</br></br></br>  <br>Here's your less gross version of ragna.</br>  <br>Post your psn nerd.</br>  <br>Noellers, Makoto, Tsubaki, Rachel, Celica, Litchi, Bullet, Platinum, Taokaka, Koko-puffs, Nu-13, Lamb-chops, Mu-12, Izayoi.<br><br>Ragna, Jin, Hakumen, Hazama, Tager, Terumi, Kagura, Amane, Azrael, Valkenhayn, Carl, Relius, Bang, Arakune.<br><br>It's even as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  Playable when  <br>Damnit, I need a ps4.</br>  <br>Then that's already more females than Street Fighter or Tekken, why the heck are people complaining.<br><br>In fact why is this in /a/, is a new anime of it coming soon?</br></br></br>  <br>It was somewhere in CP's story mode, but for all I know "I created her" was just a nice way of saying he stuck his dick in a vampire pussy.<br><br>And after looking into it, apparently the second Bloodedge book confirmed Rachel's appearance in the first book was just present Rachel using Phenomenon Intervention, so there's that.</br></br></br>  <br> Amane <br> Male <br><br>Sure sure, next you'll tell me she's immortal and immune to Rachel's mind control spell and will be important in the future game as the Uzume. <br><br>Nice try faggot but I have 4 degrees in trapology, trapstronomy, traponomics and child psychology, you can't convince me Amane is a male.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I tried. Too bad you saw thru' my ruse.</br>  <br> looks like this <br> same powers as ragna <br>  wants to kill murakumos <br><br>I hate this faggot already. I hope Nu or Lambda or Noel kicks his ass.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please give an example</br>  <br>You know there's a chance he is ragna with some dimention/space-time hijinks right?</br>  How is this anime? Fuck off, go back to /v/.  <br>His life somewhat parallels Ragna but he is different from him. At least he was able to kiss one of his harem members which was his Cousin which more then Ragna may get from any of his. Naoto still has a lot of things he has to do in regards to finding Raquel and his sister Saya. Along with the Murakumo business which I don't know why it's tied to him.</br>  <br> literally Ragna with short hair <br>huh?</br></br>   STILL no Trinity playable <br>Come the fuck on, now.</br>  <br>Must be miracle hair, because my roomie just told me Ragna is ugly looking and Naoto is husbando material. <br><br>I don't get it either</br></br></br>  <br> and he lost his right/left arm too <br>Don't tell me he using a big sword to fight too</br></br>  <br>fuck off </br>  <br>Apparently according to the light novels he's the original bloodedge.<br><br>He's also the last known decendent of the Terumi clan. Which was wiped out by his sister, Saya Terumi. His drive is named bloodedge and it turns his eyes red and his hair white when he uses it. His sister's drive was Soul Eater.<br><br>Considering Ragna, Jin and Saya were all found in a lab somewhere I'd say it's more like Ragna is a clone of Naota.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Don't tell me he using a big sword to fight too <br>Watch the trailer. He summons a big red sword when doing some moves.</br></br>  <br><br>Does Mai even have a place in the main storyline?</br></br>  <br>She'll be day 1 DLC. F-For sure!</br>  <br>He fights using his own blood.</br>  <br>She can be worked in. I mentioned some possibilities here: </br>  I'm liking the new artwork already. Thank fuck Mori didn't do it again.  As a PC player, this is harsh.<br>I still need to play CP.</br>  <br><br>Sorry I should have read ahead before asking.<br><br>Was pretty sure she didn't have any direct connections, at least so far. Certainly could work.</br></br></br></br>  The mods are fucking dead, /v/ thread up for 4 hours.  <br>Is it me or does Tsubaki look like a loli.</br>  <br><br><br>Trinity is cute! CUTE! Would download day 1.</br></br></br>  Damn it's already time for a new Blazblue. I wonder what kind of nerfs Makoto will get this time  <br><br>It's you, you look like a loli.<br><br><br><br>Play as in hit the play button on the video?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127984195 <br>If you want to discuss videogames go back to /v/ faggot.</br>  <br>This thread is the equivalent of people talking about Fate VNs or latest volumes of Index LNs. Franchises that have anime or manga adaptations are allowed here.<br>What's an actual problem are threads about LNs without adaptations like Hakomari that are clearly against the rules but get overlooked or ignored by the mods.</br></br>  <br>Hazama makes sense, since he has the life link.<br>But Terumi is a seperate entity.<br>Still, if it turns out the life linking business was actually a 3 way deal all along because of some your soul my soul fuckery, that'd be pretty hilarious.<br> This technique will kill all your time in this world! <br> Does Noel still have remaining time? [X]Yes <br> respawn <br>I've got a completely different theory that refers to some loose ends presented in his arcade mode, but those can be easily discarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can talk about the anime adaptation not the game itself.</br>  <br><br>Hakumen has the Susano'o unit, which Terumi has shown to have enough control over to be able to summon and activate it for his Astral Finish. Hakumen probably got his ass hacked and only thought he used the time killing technique.</br></br>  <br>This is false. People constantly talk about LN source material with threads often dedicated specifically to it.</br>  <br><br>That's a really cute girl on the left there.</br></br>  <br>I don't think LNs are against the rules but VNs should be discussed on /jp/.</br>  <br>Not him, but it looks more like Terumi just transforms into a Susano'o unit like form. Sure, his line specifies him as one, but I don't think he can just summon it. Being attached to the unit at all was something he undid for a reason, he can't achieve his goal that way.<br>As Terumi's body should be another fake azure grimoire I don't see transformations being out of the question. Ragna has an arm for one, and look at his astral</br></br>  Naoto is literally going to replace Ragna.  <br>I'm not sure i get the lore, but according to what i know, wasn't it the other way around?<br>I mean Naoto was the Bloodedge during the dark war, so Ragna was the replacement for Naoto, wasn't he?</br></br>  <br><br>who is the sperm wyrm</br></br>  I hope Naoto is voiced by Romi Park  <br>Please no.</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>That's Es from XBlaze Code Embryo, a visual novel set in the BlazBlue Universe.<br>She's a murakumo unity</br></br>  <br>It's<br> All images and resulting discussion should pertain to anime or manga. <br>not <br> anime, manga or light novels. <br><br>That said rules are pretty outdated and not very specific, there's a rule about "live action" and another rule about VNs but no clarification on LNs or video games.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm assuming Naoto's role in CF is to replace Ragna, since this is supposed to be end Ragna's arc.</br>  <br>So it'd be like what they did with Raiden in the Metal Gear series?<br>I mean, they gave Ragna the same conditions to act as Naoto<br><br>God damnit. Ragna's one of my favorite characters of all time. Even tho i'm eager to see the end of the story, i don't want it to end ;_;</br></br></br></br>  Is she able to fly with these wings?  Not when she gets fat  What do you think she is, a bumblebee?    <br>She can fly into this dick</br>  <br>semen demon</br>  They ruined this with the pseudo NTR and mistress garbage.  <br>Yeah, kinda.</br>  <br> pseudo NTR <br>what does it mean ? trying to search for it if it's NTR i'll stay away</br></br>  <br>a right proper semen demon this'n is, chap</br>  <br>there's a scene where she is shown getting NTR'd but later we find out it was all beta MC being delusional <br><br> Although she also whores herself by giving up her anal virginity to another man so yeah </br></br></br>  <br>dammit is this a new release ?</br>  <br> Don't forget sucking those 2 guys off in front of her bf, that was shit too. </br>  <br>whelp i guess i'll pass on this semen demon, can't even find it</br>  <br><br>She's part succubus. You are overly sensitive.</br></br>  <br><br>She kinda gets raped.</br></br>  <br> can't even find it <br>You touched in the head?</br></br>  <br>What shows up when you reverse image search? I get the answer straight away.<br><br><br>Rape is rape anon, they didn't know she was a succubus. She also hit the jackpot with the boyfriend so I think it stupid she would go for other guys at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>found it already but apparently second half deals with NTR so i'll pass. I'm on a comfy streak this week.</br></br>  I really want a second OVA. Is that too much to ask?  <br><br>The NTR is not bad at all, I'd still recommend it, and I hate NTR. She sucks off 2 guys in front of her bf but then IMMEDIATELY after feels bad and fucks him.</br></br>  <br>based Spyro</br>  <br> And takes the other guys at the same time too in her ass and mouth.  All in all that whole part was just shit.</br>  Undead Princess is better. Shame it didn't get an adaptation.  <br>Everyone knows that wings are a creation which creates a anti-gravity field, which gives the semen demon flight</br>  You people are so weak.<br><br>I loathe NTR, but the scene was pretty tolerable, considering he was also fucking her while he got "NTR'd".</br></br>  <br>true, he was also getting turned on by it so....</br>  whos this demon  <br><br>They also weren't together at the time, he thought he was just food to her so that makes it slightly more tolerable.</br></br>   being turned off that a succubus is in fact a slut <br>Fucking babies I swear.</br>  So I've never seen this, how is she wearing a bra with those wings?  <br>I have no problem with slutty succubi as long as I know that is what I should expect. Bait-and-switch with a seemingly pure and loyal succubus that turns out to be the archetypal representative of her race is however something I will never accept.</br>  <br>Trusting a succubus, even a half succubus, was your first mistake.</br>  <br>Literally semen demon.</br>  that doujin had my dick in all kinds of twists and knots <br> what happened in the school shed? </br>  <br>I don't get how people are annoyed by NTR, can you only self-insert in one character? I can self-insert in any character, doesn't matter the gender, so why can't you? Just swap from cucked beta to cucking alpha, it's not that hard.</br>  <br>Nothing happened.</br>  <br>I always self insert as the ahegao slut <br> Im a man </br></br>  <br>Well in this case specifically, she was fucked by multiple guys simultaneously, so each of them cucked everybody else.<br>I didn't mind, just saying.</br></br>  <br>The only time I could see it being a problem is the mindbreak NRT where the last shit is the guy at his computer mastubating to DVDs of his loved one while crying or something.<br><br>Shit like this doesn't come close to even registering as NTR, I think people have just become too quick to label anything as NTR in recent years.</br></br></br>  Wasn't she a vampire, not a succubus?  <br> tfw episode 2 never </br>  <br>Half of each.</br>  <br>Where would that come from when they adapted all of source material?</br>  <br><br>The issue is that NTR porn is devised specifically to make you empathize with the guy being cheated on. Yes I could "self-insert" and imagine I was reading a different story, but that's not really helping when every single page is some dude crying about his GF while jacking off. If you're into stealing somebody's girlfriend just read stuff with the cheating tag and skip the hassle.</br></br>  Can I please have sauce?<br> is giving me nothing</br>  <br>because im feeling generous<br>http://exhentai.org/g/593593/8925c2<wbr>702d/<br>color one, two normal chapters and one at the end.</br></wbr></br></br>  <br><br><br> and in the original doujin, she instead takes both of them in her ass </br></br></br>    <br>At least that makes those 2 dudes gay, touching dicks etc.</br>   turns into a fatty succubus <br> My di-<br> changes into a catgirl <br>O-ok.</br></br></br>  Which boy is best boy?  <br>that was in response to people saying it's ok for her to pee on him because kiyoshi did it first.<br>of course she's childish and it's understandable she thinks that way, given her character, it doesn't make her right though.</br></br>  <br>Nah, she's the typical tsundere.<br>At first she doesn't accept mc and gets offended by him somehow gets violent at him, then gradually develops feelings which she can't come to terms with and channels her frustration about her confusion on him.<br>She's the typical tsundere, she's just written in a better manga than tthe average ln-based harem, so she's more fleshed out and has a quirky fetish on top of it, but she falls clearly within the classical tsundere behavior.</br></br></br>  when does Gakuto shit his pants again? I want to relive this insane cringe in motion.  Mari is best girl.<br><br>Shingo a shit. But pretty damn handsome, after Kiyoshi.<br><br>Kiyoshi has best character development, as expected since he's the MC.</br></br></br></br>  <br>1.Gakuto-He wins the bro award for all his suffering<br>2.Kiyoshi-He is selfish but he cares for his bros<br>3.Jo-He stands up when shit rises<br><br><br>Not a bro tier<br>1.Shingo- his a piece of shit but can be a helpful<br>Andrei- he needs to die for being himself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Has animu ever made you cry?  <br> Idk, I was having the feels knowing that a piece of him was always with Angel since he was a donor. </br>  The purest love story.  <br>Angel beats was an emotional roller coaster. I cried at the end, but after like 2 minutes I noticed the huge plothole and started to laugh.</br>  <br>most pathetic love story, you mean.<br><br>At least he ended up with the blonde girl</br></br></br>  <br>kek</br>  Hibiki's chara CD is out, thank the based Koreans.<br><br>Tsubasa's is the next one and it sadly won't be released until next month.</br></br>  <br>KE-N-YOOOOOO &gt; *</br>  <br>But Seigi wo Shinjite was the best song of the main trio and Waikyou Shenshoujin was the best song of G overall.</br>  <br>Both her and Hibiki for me. I rarely like Chris songs despite Ayahi being great.</br>  <br>pirates when</br>  <br>Yellow was break dancing.</br>  Do people actually dislike Hestia?  Hestia always seemed like a little sister loli personality with huge tits. <br><br>since I don't like that archetype she was one of my least favorites from that show</br></br>  ay yo lemme get dat loot fam  When they started calling her Loli-big boobs I was like.<br>"C'mon, she isn't THAT short." <br>Then I realized that they're all anime characters so Bell is probably like, 5'5 at best. That bitch is hip height at best.</br></br>  Hestia was far too clingy.  <br> That bitch is hip height at best. <br>She won't even need to get on her knees to suck your dick</br></br>  Tio is onto you edition. <br> previous thread <br><a href="http://boards.4chan.org/a/thread/127966412/" target="_blank">http://boards.4chan.org/a/thread/12<wbr>7966412/</wbr></a><br>Are you faggots ready for Papi and Cerea in episode 2?</br></br></br>  <br>Nope.
