Its a petty much confirmed fact that Miku is going to be more rock and cooler then Niwaka. Natsuki gets a kick out of watching Riina squirm but it will be good to see her guiding little niwaka into the right direction in regards to rock</br></br>  <br>Even if TakeP is several times better just for the fact that he seems to have a decent backstory and development, but I still like AkaP.<br><br>It's funny how they're trying to salvage him by giving him more prominence in the new Nomakes for the 765 re-airing, but it's not as if anyone is actually translating those.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The PV had an unknown voice (Presumably Natsuki) saying "That partner of yours is pretty cool huh?"<br><br>That might be Natsuki talking to Riina whereas she refers to Miku as the "Cool One".<br><br>By Natsuki's standards, anybody who is passionate about their goals and confident in who they are is totally rocking. And Miku and her passion for her Cat Persona fits that bill.<br><br>Really, Natsuki refers to anybody BUT Riina as cool and rocking. <br><br><br> but it's not as if anyone is actually translating those. <br><br>Well, I can give a brief rundown of the first NoMake+ The circumstances of AkaP's recruitment were as follows:<br><br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wb<wbr>xbQ86iDGA&amp;feature=youtu.be</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>- 765 is falling on hard times and really need more help<br>- Takagi is wishing for a Ray of Hope, someone suddenly knocks on the office door<br>- It's the goddamn delivery man<br>- Takagi is disappointed, but another person enters. An AkaP with spaghetti spilling everywhere enters<br>- Takagi laughs maniacally. He decides on AkaP as the "chosen one"<br>- Takagi gives a weird ass interview<br>- AkaP reveals that he wanted to to be someone who cheers people up and gives hope. Most notably, he found great interest and admiration of people in the entertainment industry. But he was ultimately a talentless hack when it comes to creative work, be it singing, dancing or writing.<br>- He still wanted to work in the industry that cheers people up and gives hope though, so he just reckoned that he should work as staff at a talent agency. So that at the very least, he can help someone become what he aspired to be.<br>- After realizing he gave such a sappy story, AkaP spilled spaghetti everywhere again and as he packed up his things in embarassment, he asked Takagi to forget everything he said<br>- Takagi said fuck that, you're now the Producer for this Agency.<br><br>And with some additional hiccups and pressuring from Takagi, AkaP became the Producer for 765.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I hope we get a scene with Natsuki with her hair down. My heart would not be able to handle it  and my dick would explode. </br></br>  <br>  But he was ultimately a talentless hack when it comes to creative work, be it singing, dancing or writing. <br><br>I'd like to believe there are some audition tapes with AkeP floating around and he and Ritsuko drink to their failures pre-preduction.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if Akabane is jealous that his Producer is so extremely less popular than Takeuchi's. Not to mention how Takeuchi is ikemen as fuck while he is old and busted.</br>  <br>In all likelihood, it's probably just the name the guy gave his own custom unit within the mobage.</br>  <br>Riina to Natsuki is like a lowly cultist to their patron deity, constantly looking for ways to appease them only to fail miserably. Riina idolizes Natsuki to the point where she could just about suck the farts out of her ass just to get in her good graces.</br>  <br>Natsukichi just wants Riina to realize that real Rock is having confidence in who you are rather than latching on to whatever warped notions of being "Cool" or "Rocking" that Riina has. ;_;</br>  <br> Nana-roku-gou Pro <br><br>Good job AkaP.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd think he'd be more jealous that the CG VA's actually like Takeuchi more than the 765 VA's originally (I read something somewhere about him being incessantly teased).<br><br>We will never know</br></br></br>  <br><br> tfw <br>If its any consolation I still like him he was pretty based and cute in his mannerisms.</br></br></br>  <br>So did they fuck or what?</br>  <br>i like to think so</br>    <br>Onee-chan is kayfabe.</br>  Just came here to say Momoka never.  <br>Final boss of the show, calling it.</br>  <br><br> Momoka was controlling StepmotherP the whole time </br></br>  <br>Its already hot; lets just play with some water.</br>  <br>I'd like to believe Ritsuko made all the 765 girls watch as her fuck P-san to remind them that P-san is not a romantic option and that he's taken.</br>  <br><br>Would this be a daily occurrence, and do the idols masturbate while watching?</br></br>  <br>What else can they do when faced with such a situation?</br>  <br>report it to the police?</br>  <br>Don't be silly</br>  <br>summer fun cakes!</br>  <br>hahaha, there are two old lady who play like children here.</br>  <br> But he was ultimately a talentless hack when it comes to creative work, be it singing, dancing or writing. <br><br>If only he had met Side-M P, he would've drawn out the latent talent hiding inside AkaP.<br><br>Just imagine, in a parallel world, AkaP might've been a 315 idol.<br><br> He would've had to deal with taking Dick up his ass every other day, but come on, it's not like 50% of all AkaP fanart aren't already that. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and there are many little girls that prance around like sluts, your point?</br>      <br>Best unit</br>  <br>I want to touch Arisu with my fingers.</br>  Thread needs more images of best girl  <br>Too true</br>  Who is the target audience for this thing?  <br>On it.</br>  <br>Siscons</br>  <br>NEETs</br>  <br><br>Either I'm blind or I'm not seeing Rin in those images</br></br>  <br>Sure</br>  <br>Grandma please</br>  <br>At least you aren't blind.</br>  <br>Slut-chan pls</br>  <br>okay</br>  Yuka is the cutest   every Uzukifag ever.jpg   <br><br>Uzubutt is lewd on her own, sexualization on my part not needed</br></br>  <br>Azusa &gt; Yuka<br><br>Come at me, osu-nyan</br></br></br>  <br>Too big.

If he still has the audacity to be one after...</br>  <br>Fuck the anime. The manga is light on plot, but the anime pretty much turns it into an episodic gag series.</br>  <br> yfw Komi dies of Japanese cold and leaves Nisekoi inconclusive </br>  <br> mfw </br>    <br>Wow, a tripfag with a shit opinion. What a fucking shock.</br>  <br>The second season really shit the bed on that front. I went into it with high hopes, because I loved the first season, and was caught up on the manga, so I was excited to see what they'd do with it, and good lord was it bad. Shit pace, shit quality, the OP was eh, and they got rid of any semblance of an overarching plot that the first season built. I think it had a lot to do with it being 13 episodes, but the quality is fucking inexcusable. SHAFT had one show run last season.</br>  <br>Shaft never gave a shit about what they were adapting. <br>The first episode of the first season was excellent in terms of being an adaptation, but so many of the scenes in season 1 were tonally different than the manga.<br>And as you said, season 2 was utter garbage. <br>It may sound crazy, but I think JC Staff would have been a better choice. They may be known for mediocre adaptions, but they can at least understand that a comedy series with some emotional scenes ought to feel emotional in those scenes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>a shit</br>  <br>Yeah, I can totally see JC doing a good job with Nisekoi. It's a shame that season 2 was so rough, because a lot of the chapters they adapted were really good, but since any concept of the plot was lost, they seemed completely out of place. SHAFT's adaptations have been pretty painful to watch at points for the last year or so.</br>  <br>The festival scene with Haru was hella important, you'd think that'd make it in.<br><br>They also had to advertise the magical girl spinoff. Man...</br></br></br>  <br><br>Is JC Staff the savior of anime?</br></br>  <br>Eres un marica</br>  <br>All SHAFT seems to really care for anymore is Monogatari. <br>Now I love Monogatari, but it's like they've gotten complacent because they know people will eat up anything they make because of the art style they made their trademark with it.<br>JC could have done really well by Nisekoi, I think.<br>At the very least, the anime doesn't seem to have affected the manga that much.</br></br></br></br>  <br> At the very least, the anime doesn't seem to have affected the manga that much. <br><br>In what way? When S1 aired the manga got a decent sales boost</br></br></br>  Did anyone else feel like the anime was super underwhelming? Literally nothing happened. Even for Nisekoi's standards.  <br>I totally agree. The Kosaki-chan thing was cute, but considering the manga is full of lewds you'd think they'd avoid actively associating with it. I'm glad they animated the Kyoko-sensei chapter though. I just didn't like the way that season 2 was only really about Chitoge and Haru. The other girls have pretty important moments throughout the manga, but they did nothing with Tsugumi, Marika, Ruri, or the locket plotline. Really disappointed in it, considering how much I like the manga/first season. <br><br>HenNeko, Golden Time, Toradora!, and Sakurasou were all way better than I thought they would be. JC actually has a pretty good record with light-on-the-action SOL/romance series. Couldn't stand Raildex though. DanMachi was pretty good I guess.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Souma's pretty good too. When I heard JC picked it up I was a bit worried, but they've done a good job.</br></br>  <br>I meant as far as the content.<br><br>Because they just threw darts at a list of chapters to decide what to adapt.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm surprised they didn't make it 2 cour, I'm sure they'd find some sponsors to make the anime longer and that would let them have some kind of plot in there, or do they just don't care and do this kind of shit in between another Monogatari part.</br>  <br> Literally nothing happened <br>Sounds like a good adaptation.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I agree. It's a let-down. I liked Nisekoi season 1, but they've done what, 3 non-monogatari series since then? They've all looked like shit. KagePro was the real life version of that series from Shirobako that the director fucked up, Koufuku was okay but wholly underwhelming, and Nisekoi s2 was the biggest let-down of the season. They really need to focus on shit that isn't Monogatari, because everything else seems to suffer from lack of attention.<br><br>Oh, true! Souma is pretty good. I like the manga a lot, so I was worried about JC blowing it, but it's been pretty consistently good so far.</br></br></br>  <br>It was especially disappointing because when i saw SHAFT was doing Nisekoi I was so excited. Then i watched the first episode and thought "Yep, it's going to be perfect".<br>No use crying over spilled milk, I guess.

I am sure Sanji and Zoro still have abilities which they have not revealed yet which is what I want to see.</br>  <br>fuck off Shitbernd</br>  <br><br>I feel superbly confident Sanji has an Okama SSJ mode where he wears a dress.</br></br>   tfw completely disappointed with Kaido's design <br><br>I know we only got a glimpse but god damnit</br></br>  <br>I'm guessing next fight Zoro will be pushed to his limits. The finishing move on Pica was a souped-up version of his strongest non-Asura attack.</br>  Man, Fujitora is my new favorite<br>TRUE J U S T I C E</br>  <br>That wasn't kaido<br><br><br>it's like thinking the shadow in thriller bark was Moriah.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think Fuji will actually fight the Strawhats.</br>     thread is only 17 posts yet <br> op is some colored garbage service not a chapter page <br> triptard <br> nametard <br>quality cancer</br></br></br></br>  <br>The fuck are you talking about?</br>  <br> another giant </br>  <br>Tashigi is a libra, you taurushead.</br>  <br>That isn't Kaido,that's just a tower or Kaido's highquarters. You don't ask "where are you" when there's a giant shadow right in front of you</br>  Anyone in the know know if Niggastream is coming out with their translation anytime soon?  <br>it's usually about 3 more hours from now.</br>  <br>Sabo visibly sweating and running around when fighting Fujitora while Fujitora barely moves from his original spot and is not getting tired at all.<br><br>Sorry but Sabo exerts so much effort while barely affecting Fujitora should show you that Sabo isn't close to being Admiral level at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Space Jin is the best.</br>    <br>Or maybe..<br><br>Just fucking maybe..<br><br>The guy was looking for Kaido, couldn't see him because the island is covered in cold as balls snow and that fog and Kaido emerges from it using a stereotypical manga entrance after the guy calls out for him.<br><br>But nah, that would be too logical.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anonymous being mad like underage Akainu.</br>  <br>Sanji has already jobbed twice.</br>  <br><br> this is the level of reader we have in these threads <br><br><br>That wasn't Kaidou. More so than visibility there is no reason to call out for Kaidou if he is a super huge giant. You can walk 20 feet and find him snow or no snow. <br>He called out because apparently he is hard to find.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nah, it will be a mode related to Hell Memories</br></br>  <br> That being a tower is far more logical than the autistic bullshit you just shitted out you dumb fucking nigger, i swear to god some of you motherfuckers are too stupid to even comprehend a cartoon book whose target audience is 12 year old chinese boys.<br><br> Kill yourself you autistic cunt</br></br></br>  <br>It's a big throne on wheels. Kaido is a midget.</br>  <br>Have you never encountered a combination of incredibly heavy snow with dense fogs before? You would be surprised the shit it could hide from you even at a close distance.</br>  We literally didn't see any of the Mugiwaras.<br><br>This is a fucking shit chapter.</br></br>  <br>This<br><br>If you ever got in a storm/blizzard while skiing, with the snow falling down and fog all around you, you would know you can't even tell up from down, left from right and the furthest you're able to see is less then 5m. It's crazy, man</br></br></br>  <br><br>But what kind of creature is he if that is his silhouette? I agree with the others it's more of a tower/base</br></br>  <br>I don't think it's a tower base. I just think it's an obvious red herring. Everyone goes "OMG KAIDOU IS SO HUGE WTF!"<br><br>And whenever we see him he turns out to be short in stature or a bishie or something completely different. Not quite sure how people are constantly fooled by stuff like this</br></br></br>  <br>He's a giant den den mushi.</br>  <br>I do think he's a giant of some sort, and the twist isn't in being small, but a personality flaw of some sort.<br>Like, a constantly dere side or something.</br></br>   http://readms.com/r/one_piece/793/<wbr>2857/1</wbr>   Can someone upload the chapter to Imgur or something? Panda is broken for me.  <br> Panda is broken for me. <br>Panda is broken for everyone anon</br></br>  The wiki summary (inb4 wiki, they at least understand the raws) says that Sakazuki told Fuji that he'll be banned from the marines if he doesn't stop Luffy &amp; Law, which means Fuji will probably quit the marines now.  Oda is such a faggot for creating Fujitora and making him the new Admiral.    He protected his smile.  <br>That implies that Law cut a guy's balls off and touched them<br><br>GAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY</br></br></br>   pangamanda is unreadable shit <br> mangastream translator is asleep <br> Viz just release their official translation </br></br>  How come mangareader panda etc all don't load for me? This is on multiple devices  <br>Seriously, it doesn't make sense at all why a newbie like Fujitora was allowed to go handle Luffy and Law instead of an experienced veteran like Kizaru.</br>  Enemy confirmed.  3 questions I can't find an answer myself:<br><br>Why did akainu send Fuji and not Kizaru/green bull since he knows they are more on the same page as he is then Fuji? There is no way he didn't get to know how issho works in 2 years, so he knew he would fuck up<br><br>What does Capone mean with "ceasar will take you all along with him"? Could it be just mpanda fucking up as usual?<br><br>Why does akainu seem to not give a fuck about what kuzan is doing with BB? Come on, he was a fucking admiral so he's got to be fukkin stronk</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Doflamingo is controlling Kaido from the background  <br><br>Truly a puppetmaster</br></br></br>  <br>i kek'd</br>  <br> implying Shanks won't spank them like children and recruit them under his banner. <br><br><br>My guess is he knows Fuji despises the shichbukai system, so he would gladly revoke Law from his title. Also Aokiji warned Smoker about Dofllamingo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, sometimes he does ghost dicks/balls instead of drawing a full body.</br>  <br>According to the wiki he wants to capture Caesar for himself</br>  I know this website is shit, but at least you guys can read Aohige's translation instead of pandashit:<br>http://www.mangaspoiler.com/2015/07<wbr>/06/one-piece-793-spoiler-「ワンピース-ネタ<wbr>バレ」-第793話/</wbr></wbr></br>  Thank fuck you can filter trips  <br>It is to be expected. He has the royalties after all</br>  Blackbeard + his 10 giant captains = 11<br><br>Luffy + supernovas = 11, would this mean eventually all of them would be division commanders under Luffy? This doesn't mean each Strawhat won't fight each Blackbeard character, I'm sure they will, but something tells me he will also unite all the supernovas. Shanks will convert the Kidd alliance to their side, or Luffy will stop them before they fuck with Shanks.</br></br>   Doflamingo apparently controls most of the world's devil fruit trade <br> somehow his crew only had shitty ones </br>  <br>I know this wasn't Oda's intention but the one who came out the worst in all of this is Akainu.</br>  <br>What will the human do with the fallen dragon king ? Well, can you imagine ?</br>  <br> カポネ「おーおー、お仲間達は…割と活躍してんじゃねェか　シーザーは必<wbr>ず連れて帰るぞお前ら！！」</wbr> <br> our fellow supernovas are doing some good stuff <br> yes, we'll definitely bring Caesar to you </br></br></br>  <br><br> Fujitora use the title of Sabo to not deal with doflamingo, but the first is more strong.</br></br>  Could these two events be connected?  I don't understand this page. <br><br>What special thing did fujitora do that smoker couldnt do using his power in the navy?<br>He literally sat on his ass the whole fucking time.</br></br></br>  <br>I reckon it's just a building in the second panel.</br>  <br><br><br>Doesn't make sense. Luffy beat Doflamingo. Sabo could have done that.<br><br>And Fujitora couldn't do shit against the birdcage.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good catch anon.</br>  <br>I took it to mean that Smoker was saying "Even if I was an Admiral I wouldn't have the balls to do what Fujitora did"<br><br>Because he knows a magma fisting is coming</br></br></br>  <br>Would you be able to translate this?<br><br>キッド「あっと言う間に…先手をうたれたな…これは大金星だ！！」<br><br>アプー「ドフラミンゴは確かに裏でカイドウに通じてる」<br><br>ホーキンス「じゃあ奴を怒らせる事になるな…！！」<br><br>キッド「…これが作戦なら…つまりあいつらの目的は」<br><br>ホーキンス「やはり四皇」<br><br>アプー「百獣のカイドウか…！！」<br><br>キラー「狙いが被らなくてよかった　潰し合って無駄な戦力を使わずに済む　<wbr>おれ達の標的は四皇 “赤髪のシャンクス” だ！！」</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, Smoker is a weakling obviously.</br>  Pic related proof that Sanji and Co escaped the Big mom ship since he said we'll look for Caesar.<br><br><br>It's just a snowball not an eye.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks mate, now it makes much more sense</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Its actually just the rooftop of a building. Take a look at the trees, its probably somewhere in Wano, [spoiler/]which further hints at the upcoming Wano/Kaido arc</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your mom</br>  <br>I don't get what happens in the new chapter. Even after rearranging mangafox's shitty scan I still don't get the translations. They are all over the place</br>  <br>holy shit, capone is allied with big mom confirmed</br>  http://readms.com/r/one_piece/793/2<wbr>851/4<br><br>a good translation is finally out</br></br></wbr>  <br>Wano is probably the land of cherry blossoms.</br>  thats weird. vizanon only has chapter 791 available  <br>Noice</br>  <br>we already discussed this, Thats just a random new world country that Rogers and Whitebeard went to chill.</br>  <br> MS <br> good <br><br>pick neither<br>i miss Powermanga</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kidd: Just like that, they took the intiative from us. That's one spectacular victory !!<br>Apoo: If I remember well, Doflamingo has underground connections with Kaidou.<br>Hawkins: Then this will definitely anger him... !<br>Kidd: If that was their plan, in other words, their objective is...<br>Hawkins: As we though, a yonkou.<br>Kidd: Hundred Beats, Kaidou...!!<br>Killer: I'm glad our objectives don't clash. Affronting one another would have been a waste of military ressources. Our objective is the yonkou, Red haired Shanks !!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I feel like this is Garp talking to Tsuru in this panel, anyone else agree?  <br>I want to know when Tashigi will decide to trip and fall mouth first onto Smokers dick.</br>  <br>What? So you think the connection to Dr Hiluluk is just some random island? We know Wano will be similar to Japan, and cherry blossoms would fit perfectly there.</br>    the most important thing lost in translation<br><br>VEGAPUNK SOON</br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's Garp.</br>  Oda has made Akainu look so pathetic as a leader in all of this. Sends his rookie Admiral to deal with fucking Dressrosa, the said rookie Admiral doesn't inform his boss and goes ahead and embarrasses the organization and now all but looks like he'll abandon them.<br><br>Great. Fucking great.</br></br>  Did you guys notice how in shanks crew almost everyone has a normal cape, while every other cape in one piece is a coat worn as a cape? Knowing Oda this can't be random    <br>Yes, that's what it is.<br>I might be wrong, but I suspect Tsuru is going to see Doflamingo for herself.<br> ガープ「何だおつるちゃん！わざわざ出向く事もなかろう」 <br> What is it O Tsuru chan, there's no need for you to go anywhere </br></br></br></br>  <br>What happened to the Akainu we knew and loved that would kill a soldier just because they lost the will to fight<br><br>I am surprised Akainu even gave Fujitora a chance to clean up the mess he made</br></br></br>  <br>Look at second guy from the left.</br>   No one flipping their shit over this <br><br>Aokiji is now part of the Blackbeard group</br></br>  <br>its clearly totoro u idiots<br><br>thats why hes called "thing"</br></br></br>  <br> almost </br>  <br> What happened to the Akainu we knew and loved that would kill a soldier just because they lost the will to fight <br><br>That was just cannon fodder. Since he spared Aokiji it's implied that those strong enough gain his respect</br></br></br>  <br>He´s just there to gather information</br>  Fujitora's a short sighted tard  <br>Aokiji is using Blackbeard for his own ends i'm sure.</br>  There's a possibility that Fujitora actually means that he wants to quit the marines.<br><br><br>We knew this already speedreader from the conversation between Burgess and Blackbeard.</br></br></br>  So, it appears as though the Gorosei are not among the Tenryuubito, and in fact are below them in authority.... That's interesting, I didn't think that was the case.<br><br>CP0 (and maybe other Chipher Pols?) Work for the Tenryuubito directly<br><br>Kaido is definitely on Wano. Look at the page with the big shadow in the background-- shinto architecture against cherry blossoms<br><br>Capone is working for Big Mom, who is after Ceasar</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because we knew that for years<br><br>cmon man<br><br> things aren't explicitly stated <br> people don't get it. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Capone is working for Big Mom, who is after Ceasar <br>see<br><br>see</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought we already knew this</br>  <br> So, it appears as though the Gorosei are not among the Tenryuubito, and in fact are below them in authority.... That's interesting, I didn't think that was the case. <br><br>No, that's just mangapanda being retarded, Sakazuki was reffering to Cipher Pol as the celestial dragons puppets.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought SMILE was specifically zoan devil fruit?<br>And I would prefer the real compared to bootleg.</br></br>  <br> You are also forgetting Lucky Roo.</br>  <br>He controls both smiles and real devil fruits</br>  NIGGASTREAM IS OUT!  <br>Stream seems to say the same</br>  <br>No it didn't</br>  Why is Akainu so based  <br>Oda was too busy trying to give Fujitora a character identity that he totally forgot how Akainu would look to the readers.</br>  <br>controlled*<br><br>It was hinted at before but now we know for certain he sold devil fruits as well as smiles along with weapons like the caesar gas. I don't understand how he was so weak in terms of crew power with all that at his disposal. It seemed like he relied entirely on Marines and Kaidou protection rather than bolstering his own forces.</br></br></br>  <br>Who is the new Strawhat!?<br>Fuji gonna leave the Marines?<br>Aokiji a spy? If so, for who?<br>Bellamy for Barto Club?<br>Sanji/Brook/Nami/Chopper/Momo when?<br>Now that everyone hates Law &amp; Luffy is Law's crew dead?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Predictions on Luffy and Law's new bounties?   Capone isn't part of Law/Luffy alliance  <br><br>fuck<br>I was a little excited from last nights speculation</br></br></br>  <br>Being Fleet Admiral is more of a desk job and they have to deal with the political side.</br>  <br>GOD Usopp: 1 billion<br>Luffy: 750 mil<br>Law: 600 mil</br></br></br>  <br>They probably only had access to shitty ones early on and thats why they ate them. Though some of them are pretty strong:<br> Pica <br> Sugar <br> Jora </br></br></br></br>  Will Rebecca join the SH crew?  <br>Yes it did.</br>  <br> Kaido is a Snail Zoan <br> just as tall as the average Den Den Mushi <br> those trees are actually Bonsai or smth <br> Thats why the subordinate asks where he is, he is pretty small <br>Post yfw this happens</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His crew was so weak because he did all of this shit by himself. Lao G even said that that he 'left alone again' multiple times at the beginning of the arc. His crew didnt do anything but chill. Diamante for example fought fodder in the colosseum. He himself wasnt weak. Took around a thousand people to beat him and Luffy received almost as much handholding as he received in MF.</br>  <br>You think interacting with old geezers all day long sipping tea and arguing Navy budget has made him soft?<br><br><br>I mean why even waste time eating the sui sui</br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, his crew did have a much higher devil fruit percentage than most</br>  <br>I would for Bellamy to join but it wont happen. Maybe he'll lead a flert like Barto</br>  <br>But I thought he was drafted. What good does it to allow him to quit?</br>  <br>but they are</br>  <br> kaido is actually a den den mushi that ate the snail snail fruit to become a double snail giant </br>  So we all agree that Fujitora just deserted the Marines, right?  <br>Holy shit, is this the first time we see the garousei in perspective? They seem fucking taller/as tall as akainu.</br>  <br>So you think he handed them out as he got them and they just got stuck with shittier than normal fruits gambling on powers rather than the powerful ones he would know the name of? <br><br>I guess that makes sense. Also it seems as though the "connection" spandam was talking about when he got the soap soap and the giraffe was Doflamingo even though it was never stated.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuji confirmed for next Mugiwara</br>  <br>I always thought the Gorosei were above the World Nobles</br>  <br>Hmm on second thought maybe you're right, I still think they are celestial dragons.<br><br><br>Bellamy is more likely to join Law due to his tattoo and because Law can be his new pride of the North Blue, which is why he joined Doffy in the first place. Also he needs to survive the great wave mentioned in pic related.<br><br><br>Because he's already done what he needed, revealed the truth about the shichibukai so now he's closer to his true goal.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Based translator help them what does this say?<br><br>赤犬「ほいじゃあドフラミンゴ七武海脱退から誤報の一件…！！あんたらの…<wbr>もっと上からの指示っちゅう事ですかい<br><br>なぜドフラミンゴごときの為に！！世界が振り回されにゃいけんのですか！！<wbr><br><br>今後もこがいな事があっちゃあわしが元帥として恰好つかんですけ！！金輪際<wbr>やめておくんない！！」<br><br>五老星「…生意気な口をきくなサカズキ」「お前の面子など取るに足らん！！<wbr>」<br><br>「お前達海軍は政府の “表” の顔」「この案件は “CP” に一任したのだ！！」<br><br>赤犬「CPか…早ァ話があんたらも頭飛び越えられたんと違いますか！？天竜<wbr>人の傀儡に！！」<br><br>五老星「口を謹めサカズキ」「クザンの件はどうだ…あの巨大な戦力が今や “黒ひげ” に加担しているとは！！軍の体面も何もあるまい」</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Because he's already done what he needed, revealed the truth about the shichibukai so now he's closer to his true goal. <br><br>I meant from the Marines' perspective. You don't draft someone into a high position of military service and casually let them leave it</br></br></br>  <br>That's what I assumed as well</br>  Nominally, the Gorosei are under the Celestial Dragons but in reality they detain all the power and just have to serve the CDs every now and then  <br>Something about child pornography</br>  <br>What? That's silly, if you piss of the boss you're fired, it's simple.</br>   looks at Doflamingo <br> folds the newspaper, looks at Law and tries piecing two and two together <br>This makes me happy for some reason. I like that these two are kind of tied by destiny.</br></br>  <br>she just got her dad back she's not leaving the island</br>  <br>WOW i can actually understand whats going on now</br>  <br>Of course he's sweating, he's made of fire</br>  <br>If you piss off your commanding officer, you're court marshalled</br>  <br>Because it was bullshit from the start. He should have never gotten the Admiral job and never should have been sent to Dressrosa. Its terrible writing, don't think too much about it.</br>  So what zoan type  obviously  do you guys think Kaido is? <br><br>A dragon? A gorilla? Bear? Maybe a insect type?

Given the amount of power that have, for absolutely no reason, there shouldn't be anyone that orders them around.</br>  <br>As an extremist I'd expect him to threaten to throw Isshou into Impel Down</br>  <br>forgot this</br>  so, has Uroge received an unexpected visit on a sky island? Wonder who is that dares to interrupt him slacking off  <br>Mangapanda<br> shit grammar <br> throws meaning out of context <br><br>Niggastream<br> adds grammar <br> throws meaning out of context <br><br>They're both pretty bad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There are so many Nobles that I figured there'd have to be one or two "top men"<br><br>I always figured the Gorosei were also nobles of some sort</br></br></br>  <br> have the power to get an admiral to do your bidding if need be <br><br> give it up to be a farmer on some shitty island <br><br> people wonder why doffy killed his retard dad </br></br></br></br></br>  So how come every time we see Urouge he's about to get his shit pushed in?  <br>No, it means he'll be the wandering vagabond admiral</br>  <br>yeah, MS isn't great either, but at least it allows you to understand what the fuck is going on.</br>  <br><br>There's a scale of translation, where on one side you translate as little as possible and try to give the literal, word to word interpretation, and on the other, you try to come up with an equivalent phrase that conveys a similar meaning but sounds more like the target language. Stream and Panda are both too far on different sides of the spectrum, but on top of that, Panda has really bad translators.</br></br>  <br>Why did they use normal chains?</br>  <br>Everything is pretty much as mangastream translated.<br> 赤犬「CPか…早ァ話があんたらも頭飛び越えられたんと違いますか！？天<wbr>竜人の傀儡に！！」</wbr> <br>CP was entrusted with it... So, in other words, do you mean to say that you guys were walked all over ? By these puppets the tenryubitos are/the puppets of the tenryubitos ?<br>What's certain is that the Tenryubito did everything behing the Gorosei's back. Which means they're below them when it comes to power.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He's on her ship. I think its much more likely that they're watching the Sunny Coup de Burst away (all looking up), and Capone is hearing about Doflamingo from a Big Mom officer. He's telling them he'll personally bring Caesar back. American gangsters he's based off of refer to everyone as "our friend"<br><br>This double agent thing is reading too much into it</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Big Nigga</br>  <br>I think somewhere it was said that the Tenryuubito are made of 20 original kings? I don't remember where that was. I've always assumed that there are different "clans" of Tenryuubito, and the head of each of those "clans" has authority in their community</br>  <br>he ate the jobber jobber no mi<br><br>If your power is growing muscles you just know you will be a jobber.

I don't think a single tenryubito would be as competent as they are. Moreover, the hair and clothes don't fit. They're probably just promoted CP/Marines.</br></br>  <br>Seems fitting for Kaido to be a Kaijuu.</br>  <br> Godzilla <br>Kaidou is a giant who ate the Lizard Lizard fruit, Model Carolina Anole.</br></br>  <br>I'm not sure, in the anime its cape has sleeves, but in the manga it doesn't seem to. Same with the other guy with the pink coat<br><br>  captcha: teaching Google honey isn't a beverage </br></br></br>  <br>This is usually how a one piece chapter is supposed to look like.

Or just really tall and old guys?</br>  <br>We don't know.</br>  <br>Presumably, since one of them carries a sword</br>  When will Akainu stage a coup and calls himself fuhrer?  any chance Kaido might have a Hydra zoan? I think that would fit him. That, or a Chimera Zoan that allows him to change his appearance between a very vast number of animal mixes at will (you know, manticore first, big ass minotaur later, shit like that).  We Kars now   <br>I'm surprised no one pointed out the huge scar and chipped ear on the right side of his face, we've only seen his left side until this chapter came out.</br>  <br>I think one of them has a Dragon Zoan type devil fruit power</br>  <br> By these puppets the tenryubitos are/the puppets of the tenryubitos ? <br><br>This confuses me is it worded strangely in Japanese?</br></br></br>  <br>we did. You´re just late</br>  <br>Not at all, it's just that Oda didn't feel like making Doffy lose too easily so he made the fight last 30 chapters. Of course there's no room for information the focus is on two characters butting heads.</br>  <br>not soon enough as far as I'm concerned</br>  <br>I wouldn't really say Oda's been slacking Post-TS so much as, the "action" part of the arcs have been a bit too long. <br><br>I mean, the chapters before/after the arc fights are generally pretty filled with world-building information. <br><br>Dressrosa just had too many mini-boss fights so it felt even longer than usual to get to the "info", let alone Dressrosa being the longest arc in OP.</br></br></br></br></br>  So when do find out what happened with the other half of the crew?  <br>Seems like they might be.<br>Maybe a bit rusty.<br>I get the impression that they're ex-admirals.</br></br></br>  <br>Good point but I guess we all expected him to have battle wounds from Aokiji</br>  <br>He's a roach type</br>  I really liked the idea of Urouge working with Blackbeard before, but seeing him still going it alone is pretty cool.

Shiki? </br></br>  <br>Pretty soon, seems like Capone is there to save them or betray Big Mam and steal Caesar.</br>  <br>There was a comparison of Spanda and the gorousei during enies lobby arc but it was crappy quality.</br>  <br>I hope it's Enel, I kind of miss that motherfucker.<br><br>Shiki? Unlikely. What business does he have with Urouge?</br></br></br>  <br>holy fuck capone has been with her all this time</br>  <br>Why no other scanlator group picks One Piece to translate? With OP's popularity I thought there would be more scanlator working on it.<br>Well there was Powermanga, but they're pretty much dead now.</br></br>  <br>this brings up the question: who is gonna end up killing shanks at a crucial moment to get luffy on a path of revenge?</br>  <br><br><br> Aokiji: Did you know Akainu that ice can get so cold it ʙᴜʀɴꜱ magma </br></br></br>  <br>More importantly<br>Is the bald fuck from wano or just a weeaboo?</br></br>  <br>How fucking sick wouldn't that have been? <br> I love how they portrayed roaches like niggers </br></br>  <br>None<br>Luffy has to fight and give him his hat back atone point</br></br>   Kaido's first form   <br>a lot of scanlator groups dropped out the game when dmca notices started flying around. Back when a lot of manga sites like one manga got shutdown</br>  <br>Enel almost seems too obvious, and to me it looks like they fled the sea to the clouds, and someone unexpectedly followed them. He'd know all about Enel</br>  <br>It's just that it can mean both. I personally think the most plausible interpretation is the tenryuubito themselves being the puppets, since they're figureheads, but it's also possible that Akainu is referring to CP/a third party above the Gorosei as the puppets of the tenryuubito.<br>It doesn't really matter, either way, both interpretations are valid and don't change the fact that the Gorosei are pushovers.</br></br>  <br><br>Mangastream helps confirm it since, in context, "nakama/friend" is used in the traditional sarcastic way.<br><br> "Oh hey, our friends are doing pretty good!" <br> "And since now we know for a fact that the hardest hitter of the crew is effectively stranded on Dressrosa, we can go fuck up the skeleton crew and grab Caesar" <br><br>Also holy shit I just realized<br><br> Sunny took off with the just bare minimum number of Straw Hats needed to leave <br> Sanji to guard, Nami to navigate, Chopper to be a doctor <br> Brook is there to make it an actual skeleton crew. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So.. Fujitora for next nakama?  <br>Shanks ain't gonna die, it makes me wonder though. Is Shanks all talk, all we've seen is Lucky shoot someone in the head and Ben beat a few bandits up. Oda has got to have Shanks entire strength and power locked up, or else we're just seeing a party animal.</br>  <br>I said I hope it's Enel, not that I think it will be him. It's pointless to speculate, I figure it's pretty much impossible to make a sensate argument out of it.<br><br> My bet is on Apoo though </br></br></br>  <br> Shanks ain't gonna die <br><br>His deathflag was announced the moment he put the cap on luffy's head</br></br></br>  <br>So would zoro</br>  <br>we see apoo eating spaghetti with the kidpoohaw alliance</br>  <br>Considering everyone shit their pants when they showed up and immediately stopped a huge ass war, its assumed they're strong as fuck outside of their pirate rights.<br>Shanks only has one arm and still continues to be a Yonkou without question, and Lucky Roux held a man who can move at the speed of light at gunpoint before he could notice. Also King's Haki yadda yadda.</br></br>  <br>he stopped easily one of Akainu's punches and clashed with Whitebeard, he's by no means all talk. I agree though, we have yet to see what he can do. Same about his crew</br>  <br> Shanks <br> all talk <br>Nigga, I bet he's the strongest yonko and will most likely whoop cpt kid &amp; co if they try to fight him</br></br></br>  <br>The author is /pol/ as fuck</br>  <br>of fucking course they are strong, every single leader in this manga has been 100x stronger than their subordinates, these guys are end game strong. (the exception of course being buggy) <br><br>plus they are doffy sized so we know they aren't fucking around</br></br></br>   Bonney is still eating pizza   <br>that was lucky<br><br>Even Kizaru said his name <br><br> Ohhhh nooo it's bennnn beckmannnn' <br><br>how can you miss that one</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>right, for some reason I completely forgot about it</br>   rebecca is gonna be a crew member <br> bellamy is going to be a crew member <br> viola is going to be a crew member <br>Put them on the thousand sunny with all the strawhats. They won't add anything to the dynamic.</br></br></br>  <br> Spandam </br>  It left kinda ambiguous, is Fuji going to go after the strawhats or is he accepting that the marine's will be closed to him after what he did?<br><br>Also, seems like the Gorosei don't hold as much power as the celestial dragons, i figure they're the ones running shit fro then since most of the nobles seem to stupid to run anything thenselves, so i guess in a way they are above then.</br></br>  How high will be new bounty for Luffy, Law and others?  <br> Is Shanks all talk <br><br>Dudes got an AOE conquerors aura just by giving the slightest fuck, he don't fuck around.</br></br></br>  <br>Based on the context and "tone" of Fuji's responses, its highly leaning to ditching the marines.</br>  <br>The latter. He's not going to chase the Lawhats after he bet on them to sort this shit out. Although he might make a token pretend gesture.</br>  <br><br>It's probably the relationship a most trusted advisor has with a child ruler<br><br> Most trusted advisor actually runs shit, child ruler just a figurehead <br> But if the child ruler screams loud enough, the most trusted advisor's hands are tied and they have to do what they want. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Finally another proof that big mom is going to be luffy's ally in killing Kaido (thanks to nami's vivre card).<br><br>There is no other way that Sanji would've escaped any other way.</br></br></br>  <br>we don't know, most likely the latter. I really hope he doesn't try to fuck Law and Luffy up because they have plot armor and he would most likely accomplish nothing. Akainu will remain mad as fuck either way. I guess he regrets choosing him.</br>  <br>He'll probably ask them what their plans are and then warn them that if they cross paths again he'll be after them. He'll retreat saying the coliseum warriors + revolutionary army was protecting law + luffy.</br>  <br> Shanks ain't gonna die <br>Yeah he will, BB will kill him.</br></br>  <br>More importantly, how high will God Usopp's bounty rise and will his new poster replace Sogeking?</br>  What did Drake do with Caribou? Was his death that quick not to show on the cover of a chapter?  <br>I'll be severely butt sore if he dies before Luffy can meet up with him.</br>  <br> honey isn't a beverage <br>You never tried mead? Do so, it's great</br></br>  <br>Caribou knows about Poseidon, I don't think he was killed just like that. He probably informed Kaido or something, but there's no way someone with such informations and that received a cover story is going to die just like that</br>  Post Type Moon, if you're not a nerd.

Monsters and troops poured out of the portal, turning the shopping district into a bloody inferno. <br> The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation immediately took action and pushed the fantasy creatures back to the "Gate". To facilitate negotiations and prepare for future fights, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation dispatched the Third Reconnaissance Team to the "Special Region" at the other side of the Gate. <br><br> Ivan Ivanovich Yezhov, a Russian Army officer as well as a 33-year-old mafia boevik, was appointed as the leader of the Team. Amid attacks from enemy troops the team visited a variety of places and learnt a lot about the local culture and geography. <br><br> Thanks to their efforts, although with some difficulties they were able to find use for the locals. They even had a cute elf, a sorceress and a demigoddess in their circle of new shestyorka. On the other hand, the major powers outside the Gate such as the United States, China and the EU were extremely interested in the abundant resources available in the Special Region. They began to exert pressure over Russia. <br><br> A suddenly appearing portal to an unknown world - to the major powers it may be no less than a considerable asset for overturning the international order. But to our protagonists it is an invaluable opportunity to broaden the consumer base, recruiting base, and ultimately the power of the mafia and themselves. <br><br>I think everything would be better this way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Putin claims there are no Russian troops in the Special Region.  <br> A passenger plane that crashed near the Gate site is said to have been destroyed by the inhabitants of the Special Region using magic, though the Gate is thoroughly controlled by Russian mlitary <br> The imperial government pleads the international community for help against russian invasion. <br> The russian television broadcasters as well as far left and far right politicians all over the world proclaim that the Imperials are actually fascists and eat children, though international investigation shows that basically Empire is a human version of Equestria. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Past thread<br><br>People should know how manga<br>and anime visual design works <br>when you see this<br><br>and this<br><br><br>(Cuteness + beautifullness + optionally sexy) is more important than inconvenient realism.<br>Drawing manga is like calculate the limit x-&gt;0 avoiding the indeterminate (divide by zero shits).<br><br>That is how this shit's visual design works.<br>If you complain about it so gb2 .</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When you've been reading the manga for so long, you get really used to it.

Or did she run away from home before the gate opened or something?<br><br>Again I may be just dense or read through that part too quickly</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No they captured her before the opening of the gate, seems like they had a test run before.</br>  <br>I was talking about both anime and manga.<br>Pic related.<br>I hate to see SO MUCH TIME that logic being applied against anime and manga.<br><br>Fuck the inconvenient realism over the character visual design.<br><br>Also,<br>Both GATE design are ok for me.<br>I actually loved the Goombah's new design in anime GATE.<br>She looks like Futami Ami/Mami.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So they got through somehow in an as-of-yet unexplained way, before the gate opened.<br>And IIRC, rory mentioned that it was the god of the underworld that created the gate?</br></br>  <br>I agree.<br><br>Besides the blatant cherry picking I'll just complain about Kuribayashi if her new character design takes away from her fierce personality.<br>Same goes for Rory.<br>Right now I'm fine with it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Which one of these girls is the one that gets gangraped by the army?</br>  I want to fuck a rabbit  <br>The Japanese one in Rome.</br>  <br>Before there is a full gate there is a small hole between the worlds.

Then stayed with the completely unprepared first responders while waiting for the real force to show up and helped coach them in how to contribute to the counterattack better than they were managing on their own.<br><br>It wasn't heroic in some idiotic one man stand against all odds, he just applied his military training like any good soldier should have. That's the point. He lucked into the role of a hero just by doing what was right and within his means.

The government needed someone to generate positive PR and had to find someone to give a medal to, and since they want the JSDF to look good because they are breaking their own rules to attack the Gate, they picked the JSDF member.</br></br>  <br>She killed the father in self defence, but went coocoo afterwards</br>  <br>interspecies erotica</br>  <br> I don't feel like he did anything heroic in episode 1 <br>He convinced the police in charge to stop redirecting people away and get them behind the Imperial Palace's reinforced doors. <br>Though without him the Emperor might have ordered it himself anyway because Emperor gonna Emperor.</br></br></br>  Bunny girls are for ________.  <br> wives</br>  <br>never forget</br>  <br>marriage</br>  <br>As long as she still fucks shit up, I'm on board.</br>  <br>Also the manga made it clear that Itami was going to stay an unknown person of no importance until the Gate incident promoted him. And that he is an unusual character who didn't want to be a hero. But that's usually the most interesting situation to put a character into; Itami does things differently because he isn't like the other guys.<br><br>And it is amusing to find out Itami is actually a personal friend of the Minister of Defence, who knew him since Itami was a teenager and the Minister a young politician who lost his first election.</br></br></br>  <br>Beyond mad</br>  <br>Aex enslaving</br>  <br>I don't she looks way too dirty.</br>  <br><br>In the narrative, did ever he identify himself as military during the incident, or did they think he was just a loud civilian? Or do they want us to assume he did?</br></br>  <br>He showed his military Id to them, something they didn't do in the anime</br>  <br> He showed his military Id to them, something they didn't do in the anime <br>Yeah, it seems the anime made the mistake of trying to make his status as JSDF officer a surprise. Bad idea.</br></br>  <br>In the anime they cut it out but it's clear he told the police who he was.</br>  <br>Oh shit, I forgot that.</br>  anyone here drawing the girls?  <br>Not you.</br>  <br>I've been experimenting with new line-art technique today doing a Delilah fanart. Won't finish it today I guess but I won't stop either</br>  <br>can't draw anyway. and I'm pretty positive you can't either</br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>really, now</br>  <br><br>Kek, looks like NSA browses /a/ on their break.</br></br>  <br>Do you like pina co lada?</br>  <br>m8, I'm CIA<br><br>fuck those Maryland pussies, can't even make Assange "have an accident"</br></br></br>  <br>Wouldn't a UN naval mission have at least have one aircraft carrier from another nation?</br>  <br>Gotta fit it through the tight little gate anon. It couldn't handle that much freedom.</br>  <br> tfw from Maryland </br>    <br>Piña Colada is fucking delicious.</br>  <br>cannot unsee</br>    <br>What the fuck are they doing? Generic medieval court attire and a cape. What are the Dark Elves going to be wearing?</br>  <br>Only the most moe idol outfits.</br>  <br>...wait, how the fuck did they transport a frigate across land? I'd be easier to just build one!</br>  <br> tfw no matter how hard you try you'll never be as badass as your grandpa was </br>  <br><br>Come to think of it, they'd need to build a modern shipyard anyway to service it. This is an insanely large undertaking.</br></br>  <br>provide for your loved ones<br><br>be alpha<br><br>being a badass is a situational thing  but I wish I was </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's supposed to be a strong short stack of a woman you fucking designer. All I see is a fucking idol. <br>And the other girl is supposed to be a tall cute beauty. Again, just an idol. <br><br>ffffffffff</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's cute, I'll love seeing her wrecking shit.</br>  <br>You like to pretend she was this beefy tank in the manga but most of the time she was shown how she was described, as a short cute girl with a big rack. Her anime look isn't any more off model than everyone else in this.<br><br><br>This is cherry picking from a scene meant to make her seem more intimidating than she is at first glance, because that's her personality - not her appearance.</br></br></br></br>  <br>*cool beauty</br>    <br>She at least LOOKs like a soldier in the manga.</br>  <br>Here's everyone together to compare.</br>  <br>fuck, the inner gear queer in me is raging if they don't even get the hybrid assault shirt and the chest rigs right in the anime. <br><br>Also how many people remember that Itami was actually married?</br></br></br>  <br>I'll give you that, but they softened everyone for the anime.</br>  Inconsistent much.  Meanwhile the jolly green giant got totally fucking gypped.   <br>I think there is a difference between "Cute short girl with big breasts in the military" and "Cute short girl with big breasts who belongs in a high school anime"</br>  <br>It'll really come down to her personality. If they fuck that up, it's over. A couple of spunky screengrabs from the op are nothing to go by.</br>  <br>Because how she acted defined her character, not her appearance from one cell or another. We just need to give the anime time to let that happen.</br>  <br>I'm gonna miss our feisty titty monster.</br>  <br>She look pretty lively here  and in the OP, it also look like she's jumping and she definitely has two nice knockers.</br>  <br>Yeah I'm not in love with her anime design but it her general 'look' was often the least consistent of any of the characters to begin with in the various earlier iterations so I'll probably live with it. Though I think I'd prefer closer to pic related.</br>  kind of rather read story about ship gate than this gate  <br>Guys<br><br>GUYS!<br><br>What if the anime takes away Delilah's big fat rabbit tats?!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>then we riot</br>  <br>Piña Colada now actually looks 16 years old so maybe Delilah will stay the same?</br>  <br>Who let this high school girl into our army?</br>    <br> His platoon found and landed in the capitol of the United Kingdom. <br>wait what</br></br>  <br>More Zipang when?</br>  Mermaids when?  <br>I think part of a character in a visual medium like this is in their presentation. I could believe the type of character from the Shino in the manga because she looks the part even with her proportions  her height that is <br>But anime Shino looks like some middle school anime character and it's not fitting in with the previous iterations of the character. Nor her supposed role as squad powerhouse. All of the women in this series suffer from this weird "anime" remodeling and it's unnecessary unless you're trying to bait otaku.</br></br>  <br> how the fuck did they transport a frigate across land </br>  <br>Actually you do it by parts and ensemble it at the other side</br>  <br>*assemble</br>  I read the manga but I still don't understand who are those guys using Fate codenames and why Itami also uses a codename. And looks like Itami is shit given they call him Avenger.  <br><br> who becomes awesome in combat <br><br>Clearly, you haven't read up to the part of the manga where it's revealed he has Ranger and Spec Ops certifications.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that</br>  <br> Which one of these girls is the one that gets gangraped by the army? <br><br> - bunny girl<br> - harpy girl<br> - jap girl</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And all the times some subordinate questions a tactic and he briefly reveals how deeply he's thought of the situation at hand is actually pretty competent, just fucking lazy since he's only really there to support his hobby  and his fujoshi ex wife that he'll probably end up with after all this is over </br>  <br>She's never met an honest and gentle human male before (since pretty much only human male she's known are all rapists and killers), and started to fall for Furuta.</br>  <br> that surprise box <br>There's plenty of top quality other-world women he can pollinate, and who aren't broken fujoshi. (Miss Mexico is a functioning fujoshi, by contrast.)</br></br>  Would you a Bozes?  <br>Furuta is one of those "what the fuck are you doing in military?" kind of guy</br>  <br>After or before giving birth to a child? Fresh or milf?</br>  <br>and his answer would be "I ask myself the same question"</br>  <br>They didn't do a good job in the anime, but he basically guided the civilians to the palace. (Ginza to the palace bridge is a 3 mile run)<br>He also took charge of giving out commands to the police fortifying the palace gate. <br><br>The anime just did a shitty job with a lot of depictions in the first episode. Lack of casualties, lack of explanation, of what he did or how Japan handled the political side of the aftermath, etc.</br></br></br></br>  <br> pacifist <br> let's train him to shoot! <br><br> incapable of lying <br> let's send him in as a spy! <br><br>JSDF plz</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not until after season 1 ends. <br>They're the first focus after season 1.</br></br>  <br> mfw even the muscular male d elfs wear moe idol outfits </br>  <br> There's plenty of top quality other-world women he can pollinate <br>But he won't because he's a loser like that.</br></br>  <br>It seems to be working out for them in Gate so who are we to judge?</br>  <br><br>If I were him, I'd be all over Kuribayashi. Short, stacked, soldier chicks are hot.</br></br>  <br>Understandable though, if we did all that we wouldn't be into the gate until the 3rd ep which is not what this series promised.</br>  <br>And she really wants to shag a ranger. Too bad she doesn't dig his vibe at all. She'd be a great choice.</br>  <br>T-Thanks...</br>  <br>They managed to explain it better in like three pages of manga. The first episode just had some questionable direction.</br>  Does the manga have better fight/massacre scenes? <br><br>Because Ep1 was left a lot to be desired.</br></br>  <br>Three pages can be fifteen minutes.</br>  <br>The manga has a lot of action and gore. You will not be disappointed in that regard.</br>  <br>cool.<br><br>Not sure why they neutered the action so hard in the show. What's the point of showing bullet holes through people if there's no blood. And why bother cutting away at so many points. Fucking kills a potentially good scene.</br></br></br>  <br>It could also have been thirty seconds done slightly differently.</br>  <br>If it's going to happen (questionable), it'll be on the BDs.</br>  I just had a horrible thought. What if thy weren't done with Rori, and instead of just changing her look to be more anime palatable they also turned her into some generic tsundere?  <br>My worst fear is it turns into a generic harem and everything is solved through the power of boner</br>  <br>That vision does not point to good things.</br>  <br>I don't think so. The intro was pretty lengthy in the novels.</br>  <br><br>Maybe she can whip him into shape.  She probably fucks with the force of a steam locomotive with no brakes. </br></br>  <br>Yes. And the manga did it just fine in a shorter span.</br>  <br>Like I said man, different media.</br>  <br>So you really think that even just a few minor changes to the first episode wouldn't have made it more clear? Like letting him answer the cop when they asked who he was, or two seconds of him directing the crowd toward the castle?</br>  <br>I get you and I also don't agree with the stupid surprise reveal the anime was going for.<br><br>But besides that the anime did well since the first half was establishing Itami's character during the invasion and the second half was all about justifying the JSDF's entrance to the gate.<br><br>It's fine for what it is stop bitching man. Yeah there's niggles but they did just fine.<br><br>The manga can be faulted as well. It didn't cover that the invasion took 7 days or that Itami explained the move to the Imperial Palace in full detail after a good look at the empire army's weapons.<br><br>But no one's bitching.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This. I'm just gonna enjoy the ride and watch the /k/ and /pol/ folks funpost at each other. Gonna be comfy as fuck. Someone hand me a frilly umbrella drink.</br></br>  <br> well, 2d dark elves are usually like this <br>Should change that to "japanese dark elves"<br>No one else does this shit</br></br></br>  <br>Elves aren't dark in western media anyway.<br>They're either Irish or bleached as fuck</br></br>  <br>Don't tell that to the Drows.</br>  <br><br>Might you be expecting a  Pina Colada ?</br></br>  <br>western media aren't nerds</br>  <br>He's really missing out on this.</br>  <br>Kuribayashi is best girl</br>  <br>/tg/ says you're wrong.</br>   These guys again. <br><br>Being the senior NCO is suffering.</br></br>  <br>It's like Gate meets Zipang.</br>    <br>too bad zipang will never get translated, the anime had such a shit ending</br>  THAT conversation was hilarious.    <br>There's always portage</br>  <br>Fortunately, Zipang is licensed in my country, so I can just buy the books.</br>  <br>Nah, it would have taken just a few words inserted here and there, and besides, they added entire segments of Itami fighting RPG monsters or running with Kurata that the manga didn't. <br><br>Itami showing his badge, and Itami yelling out of the cops = 3-4 seconds. <br>4-5 seconds of showing a hill made of civilian corpse. <br>1-2 seconds of extra lines added to the Prime Minister's speech.<br><br>The time were there, the director simply chose poor priority.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It only worked out due to sheer luck<br><br>In a nutshell it went like <br> Tyuule: So why are you really here? <br> Kurata: I'm a spy.  <br> Tyuule: You do realize I'm like supposed to be the right-hand woman of the Prince right? <br> Kurata: Oh dear. Can you keep this a secret? <br> Tyuule's shady assassin master: I doubt he's a spy, no spy would be this stupid. I think he's just trying to get into your pants, mistress! <br><br>Tyuule believes him but decides to keep it under wraps. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br>  <br>You mean Furuta</br>  <br>Don't fucking let the anime staff see this.</br>  <br>See? Don't question gate luck.

WHY HAS CR STILL NOT FIXED THEIR FUCKING SUBS<br><br>HE'S A 1LT NOW NOT A 2LT</br></br>  <br>Why are you watching CR in the first place?</br>  <br>Because my dorm internet is a piece of shit that blocks both bittorrent and IRC, and fuck filelocker rehosting.</br>  Can't wait for these lads to wreck the peasants six ways from Sunday.  <br>?</br>  <br>how is she gonna fuck things up with moeface like that</br>  <br>So did he really pass Ranger training or is the JSDF just bullshitting?</br>  <br>Barley, but apparently he nearly dragged his whole team down.<br><br>He slacks off "just enough" to not bring everyone down to the ground.</br></br></br>  <br>He wears Second Lieutenant insignia after his promotion and the same insignia represents him in the OP.<br><br>Translators might have gotten confused because 1LT is called 2等陸尉 and 2LT is called 3等陸尉 (1等陸尉 is a Captain)</br></br></br>  <br>He's divorced right?</br>  <br> expecting to see the gun porn and battles from the manga in the anime </br>  <br>But judging from this  she still appear tall.</br>  <br>I can't believe a super ultranationalist pro-nippon righteous military flag-waver would equate his precious honorabru yamato damashii upstanding JSDF with the drug-fueled delightedly insane brutality of the US Army in Vietnam as depicted by Apocalypse Now with Colonel "CHARLIE DON'T SURF" Kilgore and his vicious and bloodthirsty helicopter assault on a coastal Vietnamese town, happily machinegunning and bombing random civilians along with the Vietcong on the just because he wanted to surf off their beach.<br><br>Moreover I can't visualize the machinegunning and rocketing of masses of primitives armed with pre-gunpowder weapons from the sky as being anything higher than an unpleasant though necessary butchery, certainly not a glorious crusade of which the SDF should be proud, or something they would want to be shown on TV back home like what happened to the Americans in Vietnam.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah he is. His ex wife is totally fine with remarrying though.</br>  <br>Lelei looks miles worse than her manga counterpart.</br>  <br> Moreover I can't visualize the machinegunning and rocketing of masses of primitives armed with pre-gunpowder weapons from the sky as being anything higher than an unpleasant though necessary butchery, <br>They should have scouted better before opening the Gate</br></br>  <br>Japan is too peaceful, and the military too out of the way. They really just had no idea what they were looking at, aside from something like batons or giant metallic ornaments.<br><br>I have to wonder what they thought of cars, but it's possible the emperor told them to invade anyways, seeing as he probably didn't understand or believe of the existence of the cars and towers, and someone along the line probably thought the scouts were exaggerating.<br><br>Once you reach certain boundaries in technology, everyone before a certain point just won't be able to wrap their minds around the concept.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mike Vinning.

Everything that goes through the gate is old issue.</br>  Maybe it's Maybelline.  <br>that's not what i am saying. it sounded more like those were new uniform and because of budget issues only the first ones through the gate get them first.</br>  <br>Honestly, this point isn't even hinted in the manga. Unless it was in the light novel, It's likely just something the anime threw in to make their animating easier.</br>  <br> minefield warnings <br><br>Jesus, they just keep walking.</br></br></br>  <br>Drawing flecktarn is hard</br>  <br> da fuck's a mine? </br>  <br>Right.. but i expect them to put something like: <br> Danger, don't walk any further <br>on the sign..</br></br></br>  <br>And Yuji says "Omg the mobile internet doesn't work here!" (Although this point was in the manga)</br>  <br><br>Maybe they did. But perhaps they wrote it in Japanese, which the locals can't speak for shit.</br></br>  <br>I think that was just Yuji expressing how it's finally sinking in they're in another world.<br><br>Also they eventually establish an Internet connection on the other side of the gate, I think.</br></br></br>  <br>Yep. And Yuji's joy is immeasurable.</br>  <br>There is another language on the sign, which i assume is the other sides language.. so yeah.</br>  <br><br>Then they must have assumed it was a bluff.</br></br>  Last thread is kill as expected.<br><br>So let's try again. Is mr.hands going to win the Orimotobowl?</br></br>  Bravo, took mods 4 hours to put down their hot pockets and beat down the last thread.  Good Irohasu, everyone!  <br>Why are Yahari threads getting kill recently?</br>  <br>Posting best doujin</br>  I am so mad. Which faggot reported the last thread? We haven't done discussing about how pointless shipping war is.  <br>I can't allow you to make the same mistake twice in a row.</br>  Can't wait for Iroha monologue in next Oregairu a.<br><br>I bet it's about how she shifted her attention to a certain sempai and feel dejected because he already had two best girls in school hold interested in him.</br></br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.<br><br> Late as fuck but whatever. </br></br>  <br>Last one violated rules.</br>  <br>Nah, it was just the last one because OP violated rules with NSFW stuff.</br>  <br>Like I haven't read enough of that in jap fanfics already.<br> I really hope it doesn't turn out like any of them </br></br>  Die, Yaharifags.  <br>You're losing your mojo</br>  <br>いろはす～</br>  Am I the only one who played this?  <br>Yeah I Am, slow threads are hard to predict.<br>At least I still get to read them.</br></br>  Hands guy got a rough deal in the anime. The LN was pretty sympathetic to him but in the anime he just seemed like a real life memeposting redditor<br><br>At least he tried to president by himself, unlike Iroha who runs to the nearest cock available before trying to save anything herself.<br><br>Hands deserves the Orimotob owl</br></br></br></br>  Why does Yui call Hikki gross all the time?

Now 8man and Orimoto will ride bikes together to school with Komachi in tow.</br>  Reminder that Oregairu will end with this scene.  <br> implying Iroha ever aim for cunt </br>  <br>No, I was relating it to what Iroha does<br><br>She likes him but is embarrassed by it</br></br></br>  <br>who?</br>  <br>It will happen one day.<br><br><br>Maybe she can join the service club and flirt with Hikigaya in front of Yui/Yukino all day.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying not this </br>  <br>Goddamn, spoiler that disgusting shit</br>   all these anons thinking Iroha is important whatsoever in the series after bringing StuCo problem so the Service Club's relationship could deepen. <br><br>Wake up guys, she's literally there just to attract waifufags</br></br>    <br>She confessed to him and explicitly stated that she likes Hayama. She hasn't done that for 8man.</br>  <br>She confessed to Hayama because she likes 8man</br>  <br> someone this dumb why she always appear after stuco election </br>  <br>Hell no. 8man will stop putting up with Yukino and Yui.<br>He'll make a new service club with Shizukawaii's help. He'll fill it up with black jack and hookers.

That doesn't make a lick of sense.</br></br>  <br>Just finished this shit last night thanks to you faggots, I haven't felt this empty inside in a while.<br><br>At least Yahari is safe from an ending this heartbreaking. Watari wouldn't do something like that,  r-right? </br></br></br>    <br>OTP</br>  <br>atleast she didn't pull a Yui<br> propose shit idea hoping it would work <br> get rejected <br> Lol I knew you'd reject it, I was just being retarded. <br><br>Iroha also knew that would never get enough points even if she was super serious about it, she knows how bad Yumiko's situation is.<br><br>Now she just has to rack up enough points with 8man, so she doesn't get rejected.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That is supreme mental gymnastics <br>Welcome to Oregairu<br><br><br>He's going to knock it out of the park by going for an "everyone loved Hayama and was just using 8man to get close to him" ending</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, you are wrong anon.<br>Haruno will have the pleasure of meeting pic related.</br></br>  <br>Yui is tsundere.</br>  <br>Yui succeeded in making everyone be more genuine with their feelings. Yukino is going to open up and there will be a fair and not hurtful love triangle ahead.<br><br><br>Really? She has been pure unrefined dere for a while now.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Welcome to Oregairu <br><br>Now I am doubting the interpretation of the scene at s2 ep8 and final episode. Does anybody really felt the scene that way or everybody just eat up whatever explanation they get their hand on?</br></br></br></br>  <br>naive? or desesperate? I don't know anymore.</br>  How can anyone not be a Yuifag after seeing her 20 years in the future? She is going to age like wine.<br><br>I wonder if she wanted to talk to Hikki-kun because she wanted to see if Yui liked him.</br></br>  <br>Yui fans have always been naive AND desperate.</br>   Come back to 4chan after a week <br> Yahari Threads not dead yet. <br><br>Seriously...<br> Don't let it die! </br></br></br></br>  <br>Because there is more of love than the eyes.<br><br>You don't marry a vase, do you?</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit are you me? I also picked that up and finished it last night thanks to these faggots.</br>  <br> he doesnt know iroha already interested with 8man from this scene <br>iroha even stated in this episode she aim hayama for popularity only</br></br>  <br> Some random guy starts messaging Haruno on Facebook <br> She thinks it's he's pretty cute from the profile pics and genuinely enjoys the conversation <br> She gives in and finally asks to meet somewhere for coffee. <br> Online no one knows you're a truck <br><br><br> succeeded in making everyone be more genuine <br><br>all she did was force 8man to hit the reset button on the bullshit atmosphere again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Because there is more of love than the eyes. <br>*Only in 2D</br></br>  <br>Because 8man is a denialfag.</br>  <br>I find her depressing.

A plastic bag and some greaseproof paper came flying my way. Even though she hit me, the fact that she chose things that wouldn’t hurt means she’s actually pretty nice. Wait…could that possible mean she likes me? Or was that just a joke? As if I could go through that experience again. <br><br>She was a tsundere, but at that point she is already a nice girl™ in 8man's monologues.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you say pan-san?</br>  <br> 8man <br> not a bat </br></br>    <br>It's time.</br>  Hourly reminder that  Isshiki resides in Hayama   <br> Yukinofags feel so threatened by Yui, to the point that they have to photoshop her out of every fan arts. <br><br>Gets me every time.</br></br></br>  why the fuck are you guys still shitposting when based spyro has finally delivered?<br>https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-11/chapter-1/#p<wbr>art-3</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Hayama getting pegged by Iroha while he watches Haruno and 8man go at it confirmed.</br>  <br> Miura district. <br><br>You debunked your own point.</br></br></br>  <br>because I'm too busy reading manga on my other monitor to read the translated chapters</br>  <br>A single Yukinofag did that anon<br>How about I judge Yuifags for the  wait Yuifags still post here? that's a surprise I thought you turned into skellys a long time ago </br></br>  <br> she talks about Hikki all the time. <br>Do you really think Yui talks about Hikki that much?<br><br> Yuimom was excited to meet "you." <br>I didn't get that part because it is obvious Yukinon was an afterthought.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That isn't the reason I made that shoop at all, I was simply having fun with PS.</br>  <br>I can´t belive no one had change their faces.</br>  <br>because I've already read Vol11</br>  <br>hyp</br>  <br>There was one with Yui's face but I didn't download it</br>  <br/>  YY times 2 getting BTFO by Gahamama. <br><br>Isn't it time 8man makes the right choice?</br></br>  <br>It's happening!</br>  <br> She placed her index finger to her chin and cutely tilted her head. “There’s like no school events around this time of the year and the VP’s taking care of all the small stuff for me. All I have left is just to stamp our year-end report.” <br> finger to her chin and cutely tilted her head <br> and cutely tilted <br> cutely <br>Iroha end confirmed</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, now I can shitpost with that one instead</br>  <br>Nobody cares about the LN.<br>We are all animeonlyfags.</br></br>  <br> &gt;she talks about Hikki all the time. <br> Do you really think Yui talks about Hikki that much? <br>It's literally what Yuimom said.<br><br> I didn't get that part because it is obvious Yukinon was an afterthought. <br>Yui said that to Yukino because she was too embarrassed to look at 8man after what Yuimom said.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Guys I don't know if the time is right. The mods just killed the last thread. I don't think they're asleep yet.  <br>Talk for yourself.</br>  NO! NO! NO!<br>Irohafags starting to shitpost again!<br>What should we do?</br></br>  <br>Reading biased translations by a Yukinofag</br>  <br>I believe your theory is a little flawed</br>  <br> It's literally what Yuimom said. <br>I thought that was parent talk.<br><br>I guess she doesn't want to let on she is madly in love with him? The only person who never noticed it was Yukino and even she got the message.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Compared to most LN series the % of us that have read the source material is probably pretty high<br><br>Most LNs are very poorly translated</br></br></br>  <br>All I'm getting from this is Yukino really doesn't like Iroha.</br>  <br>I wonder why, I thought she would be happy to have another girl around.</br>   Hmm, that’s funny, the chest that’s puffing out looks a lot smaller… Is the perspective off or something? In any case, I’ll go ahead and request that be fixed for the Blu-Rays! <br><br>Hachiman's monologue for Yui, Chapter 1.<br><br>What happened, Yuifags?</br></br></br></br>  <br> I thought that was parent talk. <br>It could be. But either way, Yui pushed Yuimom out of the room for the same reason.</br></br>  <br>Of course she doesn't. She's trying to NTR her hard since 3 volumes already. Yui is too much of a nice girl, somebody needs to stop her, after all.  I still hope she'll win the 8manbowl though, those 2 doesn't deserve the 8incher. </br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;1278155 <br><br> That attitude caused me to make a bitter smile. <br> Isshiki, her behavior, and her speech were charming, but there were several reasons why her actions didn’t affect me all that much in the present. Had I been myself from long ago, I’d lose my wits within the instant, no doubt about it. <br><br> didn’t affect me all that much <br><br>Iroha end deconfirmed</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is not as if Yuimom would ask if he was going out with Yui or anything. Maybe she would have asked if he had a GF or if he liked older women.</br>  <br> Komachi had a huge bitch moment, probably PMS (really hope for 8man she doesn't get this way every month, not even my own sister was this bad); <br>Do not remind me. I still can't believe there's people who dare to compare her to Miya or Mikan.</br></br>  <br> says the Yukinofag </br>  <br>Watari is pissed that FEEL removed Yui's yui.</br>  <br>how can you NTR someone that isn't in a relationship?</br>  <br>God I'd love to see how a conversation between Yuimom and 8man plays out.</br>   Isshiki coughed to check her throat, sent me a single upwards glance, and immediately looked away. <br><br> She tightly gripped one hand at the bosom of her uniform while the other weakly trembled and adjusted her skirt. With moist eyes, the breaths she let out were hot. <br><br> Then, she spoke in fragments. <br><br> “Do you hate… younger girls?” <br><br> I…… do not! Yeah! If you had to ask, I absolutely loved them! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No not really, if I remember correctly, Iroha is like a sister (or just a kouhai) to her, she spoils Iroha as much as 8man does. This is stated later in the novel, just wait for it.</br>  <br>Miya had a pretty fucked-up reaction in one of the game's bad endings, though.</br>  <br> yomiuri giants </br>  <br>Don't think 8man wants to be a bear anymore.</br>  <br>No! I'm saying that I don't get the chance to shitpost because Volume 11 doesn't contain much for us.</br>   Yuigahama tapped her hands. “Oh, but hey, Hikki seems like he’d be compatible with an older girl, for sure…! I think, definitely.” <br><br> She squeezed her fist, putting a lot of strength into it. But I certainly didn’t have that obsession, yes. <br><br>where is your god now, Yuifags.</br></br></br></br>   I found myself nodding in conjunction with Isshiki, and we somehow looked like a couple <br> :^) </br>  <br>Lurk more.</br>  <br>It was said in context of Haruno.<br>Harunofags BTFO!<br> Are there any Harunofags left? </br></br></br>  <br> Irohafags selective reading <br><br> “…That’s not really applicable here.

It certainly didn’t feel that way because she didn’t show the least amount of respect, honor, respect, and respect towards me, so she didn’t feel like an underclassman at all… <br><br> 3x respect <br><br>what is this? Google translate?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> “…You seem rather informed.” Yukinoshita smiled firmly. Though it’s closer to the smile of Nikkari Aoe than just a pleasant smile, so there was a transparent feeling of pressure oozing from it. <br><br>Yukino is not very happy this chapter.<br>Also no idea who Nikkari Aoe really is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>English is a shitty language.</br>  <br>I played it a few years ago, and I don't remember anything related to what the heck you're talking about.<br>Komachi is still a shitty sister, though.</br></br>  <br>She'll win him over through strength of determination one day.

At least have some Max Coffee™ and sweets." <br> "Well she already laid some snacks in Yui's room and who can pass up on free Max Coffee™." He thought. Although there were some snacks that he didn't recognize in a square wrapper that had a disk-like outline.  <br> He plays it safe and sticks to the Max Coffee™. <br> "Hmhmhm. You're sucking away at it so greedily just like a baby." <br> He gets up to thank her and make his way home. <br> But. "Oh my, it's gotten so late. I don't think it would be safe for you to be heading home right now. You should spend the night here in Yui's room." <br> "Ehhh. Besides the fact that it'd be wrong for me to sleep in a girl's room at her parent's house, I don't think I can fall asleep anytime soon after all that Max Coffee™." <br> "Then I'd think you should spend some time trying some these snacks. I guarantee you, you won't be able to get up after trying a couple of these.

Yukino also took advantage of Iroha's question to determine 8man's thoughts on younger girls (she is younger than him).<br><br> “The problem is what qualifies someone as younger. Their school year? Birthday? Are they younger if their birthday is somewhat early…? The definition’s rather vague. I believe we should sort that out first, don’t you think?” Yukinoshita said, blabbering on. <br><br>Yukino usually blabbers when she is going dere dere.</br></br></br></br></br>   “After all, we’re dealing with boys here who know absolutely nothing about handmade sweets. So, handmade chocolates is a piece of cake. It doesn’t cost much to make a lot and you can add your finishing touches by customizing each one to your liking. The boys will be all over them.” <br> Isshiki placed the tip of her finger on her lips to think and opened her mouth. <br><br>“Actually, that would put me over my budget.”<br><br>“I don’t know exactly how much you plan on making, but you’re under a rather severe budget if you’re limiting yourself to less than 130 yen a piece…” Yukinoshita said in disbelief, rubbing her temple. That, however, wasn’t a concern.<br><br>Poorfag detected</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminds me of the good days.........</br>  <br>Why would Yukino care about 8man's preferences in girls?</br>  <br><br><br>But it's not actual discussion, right?<br>Just proxies.<br><br>Stop hiding your thought behind the quotes.

He would have told Yui to fuck off long ago.</br></br></br>  <br>In the various "reasons", one is that he still insist her charm isn't direct to him but Hayama.<br><br>Either way, if you know moon and read up to chocolate secret screen, then you know he already dropped all those reasons, only "past me" stuff remained.</br></br></br>  <br>And then pic related<br>Also<br> Iroha leglocking doujin when? </br></br></br>  <br> only "past me" stuff remained. <br>Muh dick.<br><br>Future 8man in vol12 hopefully.</br></br></br></br>  Anyone here know what Haruno means in japanese?<br>Yukino Yukinoshita is the snow beneath the snow.<br>So Haruno Yukinoshita is the ??? beneath the snow.</br></br>  <br>Spring beneath the snow.</br>  <br>I remember that one and I still get a boner while reading it. God damn it.</br>  <br>Haru: spring</br>  <br><br>Thank you!</br></br>  <br><br>I was severely disappointed when she wasn't the focus of the last episode.</br></br>  <br>I'm a Haruno guy myself, but all she did was throw ambiguous insults that don't make sense and annoy some high schoolers trying to learn about each other. She needs to get a life, and grow some patience too. Hikigaya made the genuine speech like only a few weeks ago, you can't rush these things you dumb bitch. Also she talked about how the <br>"old" Yukino was better, and she needed to get ahold of her future. What the fuck? Isn't Yukino like an in-story super genius? Piss off ya dumb broad.</br></br>  <br> いくつかの理由で今の俺にはあまり効果が上がらない <br><br>I'm pretty sure I know moon more than any of you fag here does. <br><br>さすが一色廚、キチガイすぎるｗｗｗｗ<br>妄想ならチラシの裏にでも書いておけｗｗｗｗ<br><br><br>Nope, didn't happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I meant it more as Haruno winning the 8bowl or atleast becoming an official contender, she made an odd expression before Yui ruined it.<br><br>Besides that, Haruno is right and knows what she's doing. But what she's doing is inherently wrong. She wants Yukino to be her own person, but Yukino can't be her own person if there's someone else pulling her strings.<br><br>The best thing I can think for Yukino is for everyone to abandon her or stick her on the moon to mine 03</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ohhh, so that's her deal. She's trying to change Yukino, when that's something a person needs to do themselves. Also. Haruno a contender? Pretty sure she's getting a Hayama ending.</br>  <br><br><br>I can't believe some people are really that stupid/dense.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Me too. I was planning on watching this as well thanks to the faggots in these B2B threads.<br><br>Sounds like I shouldn't though.<br><br>Please spoil this for me. What the fuck happens because it sounds like an NTR ending and thats just nope fuck nope.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Watch it, no NTR ending at all. It's just a meme.</br>  <br>Calm down anon. He indeed does keep going "past me would have fallen for this shit" a lot.<br>I believe that the scene that anon was referring to was this one ('secret' cookies).</br></br>  <br>Thanks for proving my point though</br>  <br><br>It is pretty logical conclusion that Iroha will win. But that will happen only if Iroha is interested in 8man. From what I feel she as interested in 8man as Saki is, maybe a lil bit tad more, but she never sees 8man as a bf material.</br></br>  <br>Nobody 80%<br>Yukino 10%<br>Yui 8%<br>Iroha 2%</br></br></br></br>  <br>But Iroha is poorfag Taiga you know. She keeps falling for 8man even when her love interest is Hayama. The hints were dropped here and there, but not that obvious like the Irohafags try to appear.</br>  <br>8man's onii-chan instincts will bait Iroha into out-slying him.<br>Out-slying 8man increases his exposure to Iroha, which triggers his onii-chan instincts.<br><br>And his walls are slowly coming down with each interaction and her rejections aren't as loaded as they used to be.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yui is suffering continually while being ignored by 8man <br><br>Except that she wasn't. It was just that being with Yui is always digging 8man's trauma. So he always seems to brush her off. But it also means that he is being conscious on her.</br></br></br>   Pure Kaori being with that loser. <br>No.</br>  <br>Why the fuck are you still here?</br>  Alright anons, I want 5 page essay with at least 10 quotes.

I just fixed the hole in my socks earlier!" </br>  <br>Yukino. Because of vol 1 cover girl.<br>Yui. Because she is the only girl 8man consider to cross the line with (vol 6, later been reinforced in vol 9).<br><br>And vol 7 basically says that 8man always says whatever words easily towards anybody he doesn't give a fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is that the only Irohasu doujin? Is she actually unpopular?</br>  <br>It's not the only one. There are three total as far as I'm aware of.</br>  <br>Wait for Comiket</br>  いろはす～  <br>The next episode is coming up this sunday right? <br><br> The tension and sheer bullshitery is fucking killing me if they are going to say something fucking say it. I hate this cocking and dancing around a perfectly prevalent issue thats right in front of them. </br></br></br>  <br>It actually takes quite a bit of time to draw shit you know? She's pretty popular in Japan last I checked. In one of the LN polls she was barely outside of the top ten and that was only after volume 8, in other words that was even before she got all of her major scenes.<br><br>So her popularity really isn't even an issue in this case. <br><br>So it's best just to wait for Comiket since it's unlikely that any will be shown before that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yahari doesn't have much doujin to begin with. also, this <br><br>Also, anyone know how  8man  smells like?</br></br></br>  <br>Condensed milk</br>  <br>Corn chips</br>  <br> Because she is the only girl 8man consider to cross the line with <br>You're late.</br></br>  <br>Given how it's written the author clearly intends to have Yukino win.

I think she loves him but love is defined differently for everyone.<br> Is Yukino autistic/love 8man? <br>No, and my answer for Yukino is pretty much the same as Yui.<br> Is Iroha a slut/love 8man? <br>No, and she's definitely interested in 8man but it's not what I'd call love yet.<br> Is Hayama a nice-guy/cuck? <br>Hayama is basically the genderswapped definition of a nice girl by 8man, and I have no idea what his sexual preferences are.<br> Is Haruno Hitler? <br>She's the hero we need. She saved this series multiple times now.<br> Is Sensei literally worse than Hitler? <br>She takes the most sensible approach. She guides instead of directing. Teaches them to fish instead of giving them fish. She gives them the freedom to make their own mistakes but guides them down the path to achieving their goals.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Hayama is basically the genderswapped definition of a nice girl by 8man <br><br>Isn't that Saika?<br><br> She saved this series multiple times now. <br><br>By save you mean instilling drama?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  w-what happened last thread? I went to sleep and dead  <br>Mods happened, what did you expect with that kind of opening image?</br>  I think Yukino might like 8man, can someone reassure me of this?   We returned to the conference room and Yuigahama subjected me to a lecture on the exhibition. <br><br> The standard requirements like the needed equipment, the number of people, how the allotted budget was used and considerably abstract things like the purpose of the exhibition and a synopsis were all jotted down. Moreover, we were even required to map out a blueprint, something I could’ve glossed over had the entire thing required text only. <br><br> Talk about incredibly bothersome. <br><br> “I said that’s wrong! Make it, you know, more booooom! The props are going to be really flashy, okay!” <br><br> “I don’t get it…” <br><br> It wasn’t that drawing the diagram was incredibly bothersome, but trying to make sense of Yuigahama was. <br><br> Why were her explanations always so melodramatic…? It’s incomprehensible to the point scary. <br><br> “Also, you also assigned the wrong number of people there.” <br><br> “How humiliating… To be taught by Yuigahama of all people…” <br><br> “What was that? Whatever, hurry up and fix it!” <br><br> As I was guided under an unexpected strictness, I scribbled my pencil against the paper and we somehow made some progress. <br><br>It's amusing to see Yui bossing 8man like this scene.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure anon<br><br> Yukino copycat the feeling of Yui for 8man. <br><br>And I'm damn sure Yui likes 8man.<br><br>Therefore Yukino also likes 8man.<br><br>QED<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br>  <br><br>She is not sure of her own feeling too due to the lack of interaction with other human previously.<br><br>Proof that she likes 8man? She was planning to give her hand-made cookies to 8 man until Haruno intervened. Also she regret not giving it to 8man when she saw Yui gave her very own hand-made cookies to 8man.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No she doesn't. <br>She loves Hayama.</br></br>  <br><br> copycat <br><br>Why do you assume that she copycat?</br></br></br></br>  Is this the new 2deep4u series?Feels like every time I see people talk about not liking it online, some fan comes and says that they just aren't "getting it".  <br> assume <br><br>did you really watch episode 13?</br></br></br>  This shit is so filled with vague navelgazing and empty dialogues that its no surprise that you idiots think it's good. It also let's all of you tards project whatever dumb fantasy you have because it just drags itself on with never really committing to anything and stretching what little developments are happening to ridiculous lengths.  <br><br>Yes and I think this explanation here is mostly correct. I don't find anything else left unexplained.</br></br>  <br>This show made me realize that i'm harem mc-tier dense.</br>  <br>But the chocospoon</br>  Why isn't there an "Absolutely Kimoi" pic yet  <br> until Haruno intervened </br>  <br> It’s incomprehensible to the point scary. <br><br>Whose translation it is?</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't think those are empty dialogues. I admit that I don't understand most of what the character says, but I get the general atmosphere of the show. I felt something horribly wrong with 8man since S1. <br><br>E.g. The Sagami rooftop scene. I don't know why 8man said that to Sagami, but what he said was not wrong. I don't understand why everyone(characters in the show and also /a/ in general) overreacted on his action on the rooftop but I still feel that something is off.<br><br>Since I don't know shit about what the characters are spouting but my guts tell me they are behave like normal human in a crisis I decided to dig into these threads to find out what each character's word really means.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> YUI WHERE ARE YOU GOING YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE AND BE MY SUPPORT, EVEN THOUGH YOU WERE ACTING CONSIDERATE AND GIVING ME A MOMENT TO BE ALONE WITH 8MAN </br>  <br><br>Well it is awkward with Yui at the scene but I still feel that in her heart, it is 50/50 whether she wanna give 8man that cookie. The appearance of Haruno reduced the chance to 0.</br></br>  Why does Yukino have everything and still doesn't solve her problem? Everyone is trying to help her but she won't open up to no one.<br><br>On the other hand, Iroha is in similar situation but she sucked it up and face it mostly by herself.</br></br>  <br> I still feel that in her heart <br><br>Okay</br></br></br>  <br>This scene transcended autism</br>  <br> Yukino <br> heart </br></br>  Why was Yukino so cringe and retarded on the last episode?  <br> Yukino <br> Give </br></br>  <br> Yukino <br> wanna </br></br>  <br> Yukino <br> mortal </br></br>  <br><br>At least she's following the conversation. Put you in her situation you won't even know what to say.</br></br>  <br>Her defenses have been completely shattered. Around 8man she doesn't know how to act.<br>She's likely trying to be herself but she has no idea what herself is. In other words she's put into a situation she doesn't have an answer to.<br><br>I imagine in Volume 12 she'll fix this problem.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Expecting a "character development" and study abroad</br>  <br><br> 3 years later <br> Everyone studying in college <br><br>What will be the epilogue of Oregairu?</br></br></br></br></br>      <br> GIF </br>  <br>Fine.</br>  <br>Yukino goes study abroad.<br>Yui goes to some famous school (don't ask me why)<br>8man studies in a local school, together with Zaimokuza and Totsuka. Kawanantoka-san too.<br><br>Hayama and Miura become a couple.<br><br>Tobe got interested in 2D worlds.  He loves yuri.  He and Ebina got more closer, but not be a couple yet.<br><br>Haruno take over her parents business and get married to a wealthy handsome young man.  She doesn't like him, though. So she still comes teasing 8man now and then. <br><br>Sensei finally has some fiance,  he is a school teacher. <br><br>Komachi are applying to 8man's university.<br><br>Did I miss someone?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Did I miss someone? <br>Your English teacher</br></br>  8man will die.<br><br>But his soul will chose to go back in time, the the time when he was happiest, and he will be at season 1 first episode.<br><br>Yui who loves 8man want to be with him too and want to be in a time when 8man'd love her, but since he already loves Yukino she'll go back in time before 8man is born, and became his mother.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How... how did you know that I'm a ESLfag?</br>  Hayato x Yukino end for perfect babies  <br><br>Not him but it is quite obvious. You may want to read through what you typed again before you hit the "post" button next time.</br></br>    <br>Anyway, it's obvious to anyone read the novel that Iroha will follow Haruno's step. Since she was a school president, recommendation was piece of cake, and she is fond of managing money, too. I don't know if she still come to visit 8man, or waiting some years later and force him to marry into her family (yes I'm referring to that Isshiki Hachiman wooden piece).<br><br> Sorry for the awkward english cruel EO faggots. </br></br></br>  <br>He was obviously lying when he said no.</br>  <br><br> a yes man <br> another is repressive and self loathing on her failure <br><br>I don't even know.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I know. But do you know how to spell "sarcasm"? Because surely I don't know how to spell that.</br>  <br> obviously lying when he said no. <br>I can accept that after volume 10.5, but she's still nothing compared to his value over YY</br></br>  <br><br>So how would Komachi address Iroha if they meet? Isshiki-senpai? Kaichou?  Onee-chan ?</br></br>  <br>kuso bicchi<br><br>I am pretty sure Komachi can see through her unlike double YY.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, previous anon's post is more of a sarcasm than you calling yourself ESLfag. He was right that your English in that post is not that great, so you might as well stop replying to him. Instead, you did the opposite, which makes me get the wrong idea that you didn't realised your own mistakes. <br><br>Indeed it was my bad. You can stop replying to this post now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit. There's an Iroha doujin now?! Source please ;_;</br>  <br>But anyone can see through Iroha. It's just that her true nature still a cute.</br>  <br>So you are a mod, eh?</br>  <br> Komachi <br> Saying filthy words like kuso bicchi <br><br>Fuck off</br></br></br></br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br>what is this doing to my kokoro</br>  <br>Thanks Zaimokuza</br>  Reminder that there is no superior version of Yui.  <br>wrong</br>  <br>Yui isn't yandere and she isn't in deep love.

She will accept, maybe they share a kiss. She will go home happy, go to sleep happy, and wake up happy. Then the day next he pretends none of it happened.

Is this one censored?  <br>Kaichou would make a great waifu.</br>  Any best girl this episode?   he faps to NTR   <br>No.</br>  Is the semen demon with himecut anyone of importance?  <br> himecut <br> that fringe <br>Please.</br></br></br>  <br>I love when girls wear hoodies like that</br>      <br>needs a caption saying DAT ASS</br>    <br>Here's hoping Kaicho cures him.</br>    <br><br>You won't be saying that when she's licking his jizz off her hand</br></br>  *sip*    Time to take a little break.        Where the fuck are the threads?  <br>Preview pictures might happen at any moment.</br>  <br>Just ignore all threads that aren't on the airing days.</br>  <br>Miku. Then observe her reaction.</br>   sleep  <br> wake up <br> still no EP2 PV <br>Are they planning to upload them after the episode airs?</br></br></br>  <br>They'll come with the BDs.</br>  Read the guide before asking any questions http://buyfag.moe  <br>Some call it "board culture", but there are always some unwritten rules about this. No one would like it if some fag came here and started unironically posting reddit memes. It's also image sharing but it's not welcome.</br>  I know it's normal for things to get delayed because I've encountered that before. Is it normal for something to not come in the month when it's supposed to, for them to not give notice, and for the listing to not be on the site anymore?  <br>Have you tried contacting them?</br>  <br>I take a little solace in the fact that the page uses Chinese instead of a language I can understand.</br>  <br>They understand that giving a shit about birthdays is retarded.</br>  Moving here because the other thread is bait.<br><br>So, thoughts of this season's fantasy battle harem?</br></br>  <br>Her delusions are funny enough for me to keep interested in this show<br>I think I'll only watch it for her</br></br>  <br>Naturally I am here for the cool aerial doglfights and for the girls. The rest don't matter to me in a battle harem work.<br><br>The action at the beginning was pretty cool. Hope there will be more and better ones.<br><br>For the girls, I follow my heartpenis. Yuri &gt; Freon &gt; Misora &gt; Chloe &gt; Rico &gt; Lecty</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> dropping anime <br> ever <br> that shit taste <br>Just fucking kill yourself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>microwave</br>  <br>Is Chloe the childhood friend?<br>She is my second favorite</br></br>  Have fun.  <br><br>thank you for the amazing artwork anon :3c</br></br>    <br>The rest of us should make up our own repetitive shitposts as well. That way we can stop pretending these threads have any original content at all.</br>  <br>What's that? A picture for ants? Fuck off</br>  <br>Thanks for providing me the sauce that I couldn't find myself.</br></blockquote>]
