[ Is there such a thing as an English dub that /a/ can tolerate?  You posted it.  Haruhi was alright, but only because of Crispin Freeman.  DB, YYH, some other shounen  Hellsing was pretty good.  Baccano<br><br>I cant believe it took this long to say it.</br></br>  Cromartie High, with the exception of Mechazawa. The voice acting complimented the humor really well.  <br>Berserk dub is pretty good. Black Lagoon is one of the best I've heard so far. FLCL, while being a shit show, has a fantastic dub. Cowboy Bebop seems to be obligatory for most people but I never saw it as all that special myself. It's just decent. How is it that none of these were posted yet?</br>  Panty &amp; Stocking works better in english than in japanese   Not watching your Anime muted while playing Beethoven's Piano Sonata No.8 and No.19, or alternatively one of his many String Quartets. <br><br> Having the nerve to watch anime on a screen any smaller than 60 inches and at anything less than 720p, without a glass of wine that is at least equal to or above the caliber of Dom Perignon. <br><br> Thinking that you can truly understand the Japanese tongue before having seen the Cherry blossoms in person as they fall upon your cheek while you run in a rushed, yet gingerly manner with toast hanging out of your mouth. <br><br> Thinking that any Anime made by a director that doesn't suffer from depression and works with animators that work less than 18 hours a day should even make it onto your palette let alone be worth your time to judge the audio quality and its various versions. <br><br> Not understanding that Anime was a mistake from the start and that despite the preparations you should make before watching it, mentioned at the beginning of this post, started going downhill (in terms of overall quality) after 1918. <br><br>I knew I was among casuals, just not casuals of this bottom scrapping quality.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>have a wank, lad</br>  <br>Black Lagoon by a mile</br>  Oh and Helsing  I can't stand any English dub, it just feels wrong. Latino dubs, on the other hand...  There's like a bajillion great English dubs. It be simpler and shorter to ask which ones are shitty.  Stand Alone Complex is alright  A lot of bad anime is made watchable only through completely shit dubs. You're already not watching it for the content so it doesn't matter if the dub is absolutely ridiculous and nowhere near the original meaning.  <br>I just started watching Blue Seed tonight for the first time and it had one of the worst English dubs I've ever heard in my life, on par with Genocyber. I'm normally rather indifferent to dubs and sometimes prefer it because I just don't feel like having my eyes glued to the screen the whole time in order to follow the story but that was one of those times when it was so unbearable that I just had to switch to Japanese.</br>  <br> nowhere near the original meaning <br>This argument is pretentious as fuck and falls flat whenever you're talking about an adaptation. Which is the majority of anime.</br></br>  The problem with English dubs is the very uncomfortable contrast between the kawaii visuals and characters, and the not-so-kawaii voice acting. Men are tolerable, but women aren't. Female English VAs can't reach the same high-pitch as Japanese female VAs can. What should be a cute highschool girl always either sounds like some ditzy slut from California or a soccer mom.<br><br>It's really jarring, honestly.</br></br>  <br>Haha</br>  <br>What argument?</br>  I prefer the dub on Spice and Wolf. Holo's english VA just sounds so much more mature.  <br>This is why all the great english dubs you hear about are either western inspired anime or/and shows that feature mainly adult characters - Redline, Bebop, Black Lagoon, Dandy, Cromartie (yeah they're in highschool but they were bloody jojo tier), etc.<br><br><br>The argument of the voice acting somehow carrying the "original meaning" despite the original work having no voice acting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck. I'm not talking about the quality of the voice acting, I'm talking about the script. Which would adhere to the original work in at least some form in a genuine adaptation, which some dubs don't do.<br><br>See: Ghost Stories.</br></br></br>  Eva 2.22 have a good eng dub for me  <br>What about when they cast actual teenage girls for the part like they did for Nadia? I thought was very well cast, even if the rest of that dub was pretty shitty.</br>  Good/Tolerable Dubs:<br><br> Baccano <br> GTO <br> Golden Boy <br> Ghost Stories <br> Cowboy Bebop <br> Samurai Champloo <br> Afro Samurai <br> Space Dandy <br> Mushishi <br> Mobile Suit Gundam 08th MS Team <br> Black Lagoon <br> Abenobashi Magical Shopping Arcade <br> Beck <br> Full Metal Panic <br> Anything by Studio Ghibli <br> Summer Wars <br> The Girl Who Leapt Through Time <br> Steam Boy <br> Memories <br> Evangelion <br> Ouran Host Club <br> Shuffle <br> Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya <br> Wolf Children <br> FLCL <br> Gurren Lagann <br> Ghost in the Shell <br> Black Cat <br> Death Note <br> Monster <br> Blue Exorcist <br> Deadman Wonderland <br> Irresponsible Captain Tylor <br> Redline <br> Cromartie High School <br> A Letter to Momo <br> Tsuritama <br> Big Windup! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That has nothing to do with the format of dub you fucking idiot. One is a translation written, the other is a translation done in audio. Either one can be fucked up just as bad as the other. Did you miss all the S;G commie shitstorms?</br>  <br>I daresay Golden Boy english dub is better than its japanese version</br>  <br> Full Metal Panic <br>But the dub isn't shit enough to make this garbage somehow amusing like Ghost Stories.</br></br>  <br>Oddly enough, Ghost Stories dub is the same story (which surprised me) as the Japanese. They only made it funny.</br>  I'll always have a special place in my heart for the School Rumble dub.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dT9<wbr>yRsFYQYo</wbr>  [ ]</br>  http://www.reddit.com/r/Animedubs/c<wbr>omments/2plz28/dubs_vs_subs_thread_<wbr>xpost_ranime_and_ranimesuggest/<br>Neo-/a/ and Reddit seem to agree on a lot of things. Maybe you should consider posting there instead.</br></wbr></wbr>  <br>Good recent dub coming through.</br>  <br><br>Haruhi, FLCL, Panty and Stocking, and Cowboy Bebop are the only ones I've encountered so far.</br></br>  <br>Which isn't a good thing, considering she's supposed to sound like she's 16.</br>  <br><br>She's supposed to sound young.

There is also the point that the voice acting is in line with the director's vision, as opposed to removing part of the show and replacing it with an alien element.<br>The adaption is a new take on the source.<br>The dub is replacing one element in a finished product.<br>You'd be correct if you were talking about a separate full adaption, but you're not.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A cute awoo~lf girl?</br>  The Normie animes suit better with English, but Berserk had a great dub, Watamote was pretty good for the most part, and Kill La Kill's was perfect.  <br><br>It's just opinion of course, but I feel like a more mature voice suits her personality better even if it doesn't match her appearance.</br></br>  well, there are exactly ten acceptable dubs<br> check em </br>  <br>Yeah because the voice actor chosen isn't completely the studio's decision oh wow how much of a deluded cunt are you exactly?</br>  <br>Didn't Eiichiro Oda choose the Funimation cast for One Piece?<br>The main characters anyway.</br></br>  <br>7/10<br>I chuckled heartily.</br></br>  Stuff and things.<br><br>twitter.com/cube_sa - author twitter<br>bokunomanga.org - scanlation<br>seizonscans.actionprinny.com - livetl announcements</br></br></br></br>  There should be 5 chapters dedicated to her getting fucked in every which way possible to cure my blue balls from this "will they or wont they?" bullshit.

The idea is he was shaken up by thinking Mizuki hated him for some reason before realizing it was probably someone else.</br>  next chapter tomorrow still?  <br>Her name is IDEko—and IDE is the muscle guy so... I hope most of you got the joke with that, right? Please?</br>  <br>Pretty much every character is part of the harem now.</br>  <br> Tamako made Takeru cry <br>UNACCEPTABLE</br></br>  <br>Takeru you're crying for a reason.</br>  <br>Please elaborate, I'm retarded.</br>  <br>Someone else fill him in.

I would say in this case he isn't so much referencing ko being popular in female names but ko being used on literally every rule 63.

But I think it would be hilarious if they were unaware of each other when they're basically clones.</br></br>  <br>Fuck. I know a bitch like this in real life.</br>  It's great to go from two weeks of no Mizuki Mondays to two chapters in two days and a long weekend.  Not the best chapter, as expected of Yamada, but I suppose these sorts of chapters are needed every once in a while.  <br>Does she eat the rug?</br>   http://tieba.baidu.com/p/386616463<wbr>1</wbr> <br>That's the cover page I've been waiting for... damn.</br>  <br><br>Bishie rival for Takeru? <br>Fuuuuuuuuuck</br></br></br>  <br> http://tieba.baidu.com/p/386616463<wbr>1</wbr> <br>F U C K<br>U<br>C<br>K</br></br></br></br></br>  ITT: characters who attempted suicide  How the fuck can you fail at killing yourself?<br>How much of a loser do you need to be to not even manage to take your own life?</br>  Does this count?    <br><br>The fear of death can be overpowering.</br></br>  <br> attempted suicide <br>I'm pretty sure that phrase doesn't include whether or not the suicide was successful or a failure.</br></br>  <br>Because not everyone lives in a country with convenient access to firearms, sheltered boy. And tall buildings have a safety fence for that exact reason.</br>  <br>Whose eyes are those eyes?</br>  <br>For the record, "attempted suicide" usually does not imply that someone tried to commit suicide but somehow failed, like trying to hang yourself and the rope snapping. It usually just implies that someone started to commit suicide (e.g. tying the noose and hanging it from the ceiling) but ultimately did not commit suicide. This can be due to them chickening out, being talked down, or in some other way not following through. In real life, very often people will attempt to commit suicide in very public ways and stall for a long time because the fear of death is so overpowering, often giving police a chance to talk them down.<br><br>Occasionally, of course, people actually do follow through on committing suicide and somehow fail. One example is trying to overdose on something like sleeping meds, but not taking enough. Another example is cutting your wrists but having doctors or police stop the bleeding before it's too late.<br><br>Why the fuck did I take the time to type all that. Goodnight /a/.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You just have to be a bit creative, like jumping off that tall building but with your neck in a noose of a 100 meter rope.<br><br>By the way, firearms don't have 100% lethal rate either, for whatever silly reason. Do you suppose they actually miss at point blank range?</br></br></br>  <br>You're either underage, an idiot, or both. Whichever it is, leave /a/.</br>  <br><br>That is usually because of popular myths about how to kill yourself with firearms. Tell me, do you actually know the location(s) you can shoot yourself that will give you a painless death that most people prefer for suicides?<br><br><br><br>その目だれの目？</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> acuire knife <br> cut things until you bleed out <br><br>Not that difficult.<br>Alternatively<br><br> leave house <br> start walking <br> keep walking <br> start walking off road <br> start getting hungry <br> sun goes down <br> continue walking <br> freezing cold, can barely move anymore <br> take a nap <br> wake up, starving and weak <br> keep walking <br> collapse <br> eaten by buzzards </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> One example is trying to overdose on something like sleeping meds, but not taking enough.  <br>The best example is trying to overdose on sleeping meds without realizing that OTC sleeping meds just make you delirious at high doses, then waking up the next day naked in a ditch somewhere with no memories.</br></br>  <br> painless death <br>What's the rationale behind this? How can someone not fear death but fear pain?</br></br>  <br>Nope, though I would probably do some research if I wanted to use a gun for that purpose. I wouldn't actually care for "painless" though.</br>  <br><br>It's how he gets stronger</br></br>  <br>It's easy, you just point the gun at someone, take their money, and buy an exit bag.</br>  <br>For many reasons, you Dr. psychologist.</br>  <br>Some people don't want to live anymore but that doesn't mean they want to be in pain during their final moments. Take someone who has a degenerative disease and is looking for something like an assisted suicide for example, they're dying to avoid the inevitable pain that would be the rest of their life.</br>  <br>That alternative sounds amazingly difficult and tedious. If I wanted to kill myself, I wouldn't want it to take literal days, anon. That's why a rope is the most popular choice. If done correctly, hanging yourself is quite quick.</br>  <br>Try that in the old world and you've got a 70% chance of waking up in a hospital.</br>  <br><br>You would be surprised how weak the people who want to kill themselves are. Why do you think areas with tall cliffs and bridges have much higher suicide rates when there are plenty of effective, but far more painful methods out there? Dying without pain is something most people will opt for unless there is absolutely no other option.<br><br><br><br>Even with the research done, it's difficult and you only get one chance. Otherwise enjoy bleeding out/organ failure without having any ability to do anything about it once you miss.<br><br>Then you are one of the outliers if that's true.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I guess there is a point where you think whatever come after death isn't as bad as being alive,  some time ago I cut my wrist hollywood style, I was very scared, but it actually didn't hurt that much, in any case I just heal myself after it, is not that funny when there is not a single person that give a shit about you.   <br>That sound awful, i'm actually more scared of starving than throwing myself off a building/bridge.</br>  <br> Even with the research done, it's difficult and you only get one chance. Otherwise enjoy bleeding out/organ failure without having any ability to do anything about it once you miss. <br>I actually considered trying to contact a professional assassin and paying him to shoot me.<br>Do you think assassins have some professional code that forbids them from killing their employers? What if I pay him and then he refuses to do his job?<br>I considered putting the money into a plastic bag and carrying it underneath my jacket, so it doesn't get dirty with the blood, but the easiest way for him to get it is to actually pull the trigger. But then he might refuse the job because he can't count the money inside the bag. But if I take out the money for him to verify that it's the promised amount, we're back to the problem where he might just leave me empty-handed and alive.<br>Hitmen are scary.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> YOU'RE ALWAYS SUPER SPECIAL </br>  <br><br>I'd considered a similar method during winter. It's easier to freeze to death rather than starve. The initial plunge into cold weather would be difficult, but once you settle down and try to sleep it -should- be successful.<br><br><br><br>I have absolutely no experience with hitmen, but I'm not sure you'd be able to convince one to even take your contract, assuming you can even pay one. Theoretically, as long as there is absolutely nothing to link you to him, it shouldn't be an issue. I'd suggest you try to find a simpler solution than hiring a hitman though. There's plenty of other effective methods that are less convoluted.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  In NGE Asuka cut herself and tried to bleed out.<br>I'm pretty sure Shinji tried to drown himself at the start if EoE</br>  All these painful methods. Just buy an exit bag/buy the parts depending on the legality of buying them together. There's no pain/suffocating feeling so it feels like falling asleep, except you don't wake up again.<br><br><br>I really hope drunk me doesn't remember this snap and try to recreate it.</br></br></br>  <br>Takumi can kill servant.</br>    <br>Mean to quote </br>  He actually does it  Would you prefer to die quietly with possibly nobody ever finding out you're dead or to go out with a bang and announcing it to everybody who ever knew you (possibly with a "it's your fault" attached to the message)?  <br>But can he kill Accelerator?<br><br>protip:  probably </br></br></br>  <br>it's practically his hobby</br>  <br>are you stupid?<br><br>People that kill themselves is because they don't want to suffer anymore, why the fuck would they want to suffer during their fucking death too?</br></br></br>  <br>So they aren't treated like chickens in the afterlife.</br>  <br>Supposedly the helium method is cheap, effective and reliable.<br><br>There's a image guide circulating around /b/ so if anyone is interested just go there, too lazy to search for it though.</br></br></br>  <br>Killing yourself is pretty hard (without guns) and the best bet is to hang yourself, but the chance of that succeeding is still only 80%. You see, your body makes so much noise grasping for air they are mostly found. Also the rope could snap or whatever.</br>  <br> the rope could snap or whatever. <br> trying to hang yourself <br> trying to save money on the fucking rope <br>This sounds so dumb.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you got money to hire a hitman, just spend that first and just hang yourself :).</br>  The neps are very cute.

I kind of always wanted to write and direct movies but animation seems like I could be more creative. It seems like all the quality animation is being made in Japan though, while the States are stuck making gay Nickelodeon shows and super hero shit. How can one get involved in making anime if they aren't from Japan?  During the beginning of the Cold War, the world grows wary and worried that tensions between the USSR and the US would lead to a breakout of another World War. As a result, the European nations, South Africa, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the ASEAN nations alongside some concerned US and German WW2 vets got together to fund and form GRACE(Global Reactionary Arbitratory Conflict Enforcement) to act as a global police to keep world superpowers in check to ensure that another conventional conflict will not happen. <br><br>Fast forward to 2040 and the world is under threat again, not from political disputes between global superpowers but from a new organization known as the Humanity Liberation Front(HLF). The HLF aims to free humanity from what it perceives as an iron cage brought upon by the embrace of bureaucracy and capitalism. As the hopes and ambitions of the people are weighed down in the Capitalistic system of the global economy, more and more people support and endorse the acts of the HLF. <br><br>This is where MC comes in. The MC is a member of GRACE and is a member of its Psychological Operations corps which role is to use psychology to suppress the enemy and obtain information. At first since the MC is sympathetic to the HLF's cause but disagrees with the way they forward them(through acts of terrorism), he sides with GRACE and tries to not kill any hostiles he sees. As operations go by, his reluctance to kill caused serious consequences such as the deaths of civilians and more ripples between the tensions between the world superpowers, particularly between the US and China and the US and GRACE itself. The MC thus slowly goes more lethal and even more atrocious than the HLF themselves. <br><br>Generally the series does not really define who is the good or bad guy. The HLF will be endorsing Existentialism and feels that all must be done to ensure the radical freedom of the people. GRACE believes such freedom to be detrimental to peace and thus opposes the HLF.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fug, I meant "another World War will not happen".

In MC's time more inventions, philosophical ideas and scientific discoveries are made. All these discoveries are threatened as the Church of England got word on Darwin's theory of Evolution as he publicly revealed at a conference at the Natural History Museum. As he gave his speech detailing this theory, he is shot and documents detailing of his research was stolen.<br><br>MC is called by the police to aid them in this investigation and as MC investigates and uncovers more clues, he uncovers a shitload of conspiracy within the Church of England and how fractured it is. A Calvinist faction in the Church of England, aims to use the findings of Darwin to make human beings mutate into monstrosities(think of the beasts in Bloodborne for better image I guess) and unleash them all over London. To this faction, the predestined would not be affected by this and that they are doing God's will by trying to uncover and segregate the Reprobate from the Predestined. Another faction in the CoE is at war with the Calvinist faction but is anti science, believing that Darwin's research must be destroyed and hid from the public. Anyone with knowledge of it must die. A third faction within the CoE aims to overthrow the monarchy given how the monarch is getting more tolerant of differing religions and Catholicism. (Part 1)</br></br>  bump  <br><br>As MC uncovers a plot by the Third Faction to assassinate a member of the Royal Family by poisoning his communion waffle that he will consume during Holy Communion. MC goes to the same church as the prince prior to service and tries to stop the attempt. He is mistaken by the other deacons and reverends at the church to be a Catholic saboteur and is the one charged with attempted murder. MC is then detained at a police station. As the service began, the prince was poisoned after taking Communion. MC is suspected of tampering with the communion waffles earlier and for the seriousness of the crime, sentenced to the Tower of London for interrogation and harsh punishment.<br><br>At the Tower of London, MC is interrogated about the death of the prince. MC is whipped as he denies and tries to convey his findings about the Church of England which is seen as blasphemy. As the news itself became a big hit on the newspaper and word got around, the Anti Papist riot erupted all over London and Catholic churches are ransacked with Catholics getting beaten up by angry CoE faithful. This situation gives MC the window to escape from the Tower of London as guards stationed there are deployed to contain the riots. The Calvinist faction of the CoE also released its toxin that mutates those that inhaled it during the riots, causing more trouble for the police. With infected mutants now causing rampage around the Streets of London, the Home Guard and the elite Queen's Guard are deployed to hunt them down. <br><br>The presence of the monsters also slowly led to the stop of the riots as everyone is now running for their lives. Because of the Anti Papaist riots, the presence of the mutated things are seen as signs from the Devil by the populace and the parts of the Church of England that are not affiliated with any of the three bickering factions as a Divine Sign that the Devil is trying to cause disunity and fragment the Body of Christ by getting the CoE to attack Catholics.

The faction also planned to kill off John Henry Newman given the High Church Oxford movement is now actually gaining ground thanks to this situation. All over London at the meantime, citizens are forced off the streets as the police, Home Guard and Queen's Guard hunt down the infected mutants that plague the city. MC who managed to escape from the Tower of London through the city's sewer systems now have to hide away from the authorities that are patrolling the streets. <br><br>The MC tries to get shelter and a place to clean up from all the filth of the sever. He is locked out of the fear that he could turn into one of the mutants and infect them. As the MC continues seeking shelter, he came across a woman who agrees to help him out. The woman herself is part of a Catholic organization that seeks to destroy any threats to the Catholic community in England and that includes the Three warring factions in the CoE which while opposing each other, are Anti Catholic in nature. MC is reluctant at first out of fear of aiding in a potential rebellion against the state but decides to follow her anyway given how little choice he have. The Catholic Org is aware of his credentials and activities(some of the organization's members saw him when conducting some recon over various CoE churches and cathedrals around London. <br><br>At the org's hideout beneath Westminster Cathedral, MC shares his findings with the org and is offered protection and more places to "investigate" with the base of the Calvinist faction at the Metropolitan Tabernacle church at Elephant and Castle.

At the suggestion of a coworker, he tries online dating and ends up meeting a girl. She's a sweet girl who works at a used bookstore. They hit it off and start dating. After a few months the MC is head over heels in love, but he starts to notice odd things about the girl and decides to follow her around one day. Near the end of the day he sees her pick up a delinquent looking guy. MC thought something was wrong, but he didn't suspect this and now he feels like shit. MC decides to follow them into an alleyway to confront her, only when he gets to the alley he sees the guy being torn apart by his gf's hair and being fed into a mouth on the back of her head. Seeing his girlfriend like this, the MC realizes that she is a Futakuchi-onna. She drops the guy’s body and starts freaking out, telling the MC that it's not what it looks like. Crying she rushes up to the MC and embraces him. MC hugs her back and tells her he loves her. They go back home and act as if nothing happened. Series follows MC as he tries to live with the fact that he's turning a blind eye to his gf's eating habits.  <br>So it's impossible for girls in KyoAni to have the same height?<br><br>Come on, man.

You know you already lost.</br>  What's with the same face argument? Most anime designs suffer from this shit that's why they use different hair and eye color.   KyoAni <br><br>That means I have to right a pandering moeblob.<br>I want to write Maouyuu meets LOGH. Fuck KyoAni.</br></br></br>  <br> Even so, abandoning realism <br>see <br><br><br>It's pretty real, bro.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not even the person you're replying to but that post was Reddit.</br>  How did MAPPA, a relatively new anime Studio become such a powerhouse in terms of animation?  <br>All it takes is a handful of talented animators. It's not always about the money that goes into a show, it's more about the skill of the people making it.</br>  Who?  <br> mappa anything but the most mediocre studio out there <br>how is your first anime going?</br></br>  literally who  <br>I believe they did Sakamichi no Apollon, Zankyou No Terror, Shingeki no Bahamut; Genesis and collaborated with Madhouse on Hajime no Ippo Rising.</br>  <br>The same way Gonzo had good animation - they were talented staff jumping ship from another studio.</br>  <br> The same way Gonzo had good animation <br><br>Ah, so they've only produced shit. Gotcha.</br></br></br>  beside creative and good animation, everything else is pretty meh<br>Well at lest they are number 2 Notamin choice</br>  <br>Actually, not too true. <br>The secret of MAPPA's success is Maruyama, the founder of MAPPA. <br><br>He's probably the most important person in anime industry right now. Unlike Miyazaki who retire, and Anno who only cares for Eva, Maruyama always keep making new project, new anime. <br><br>Just see what he did in Madhouse back then. He still not give up to create his "ideal" place.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They can't be a powerhouse if virtually everything they've done solo has flopped. Punchline in particular has become, well, a punchline.<br><br> I guess Japan isn't ready for the punchline. </br></br></br>  <br> Just see what he did in Madhouse back then. <br><br>Bankrupt them?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah stuff they've produced has flopped but regardless their shows have some pretty impressive animation.</br>  <br>that impressive animation won't Last if they can only do anime that sell like shit</br>  <br>Yeah, what I scared is they went to bankrupt or Maruyama dies. <br><br>But I hope they managed to make Pluto adaptation. Maruyama said that project must be done before he dies. And he's thinking one hell of crazy budget.<br><br>800 Million Yen.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mappa needs to make enough money to do this. I've honestly enjoyed every show of theirs I've seen so hopefully they stay around for quite some time.</br>  If ZnTerror, SnB and Punchline are "powerhouse" animations then anime truly is dead.  Perhaps they should start adapting some popular light novels.<br><br>Madhouse did Mahouka and No Game No Life. Those two did kind of well for them sales-wise.</br></br>  <br>ZnT &amp; SnB were pretty visually impressive shows. Haven't seen Punchline.</br>  <br><br>Hakomari adaptation by Mappa when?</br></br>  <br>Punchline is pretty neat. I like the style and the animation is good. I wouldn't say jaw dropping but it's a very pleasant show to look at.</br>   no one mentions GARO yet <br>I hate you all</br>  <br>I honestly dropped it. First 2 episodes didn't really interest me and seeing the comparison in animation to Shingeki no Bahumat made me think it wasn't going to be good as they don't have the "A" team working on or something. It's been a while but I just remember being disappointed.</br>  Zankyou no Terror is garbage  <br>Mappa = Madhouse<br>Madhouse = deadhouse<br><br>See Gainax and Trigger.<br>Brainbase and Shuka.<br>Shaft and Silvelink.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Shaft and Silvelink <br>Shaft will be eternal till then ran out of Monogatari material to animate.</br></br>  Madhouse are the new Arms.  <br>But ARMS is fuckign great - it does porn, it has Umetsu and some of the greatest industry animators. It does lot of shit, but it can be better than most least animation wise if budget is present.<br><br>Meanwhile Madhouse is just deadhouse.</br></br></br>  <br>It's directing, animation and soundtrack isn't.</br>  <br>Maoyuu looks 10 times better than Overlord. So no. Madhouse != Arms. Arms &gt; Madhouse.<br><br>Madhouse is old bankrupt Gonzo.</br></br></br>  <br>because the people are not new like you.</br>  <br>They also did Garo, which was actually pretty fun.</br>  <br>Aren't new studios supported by their goverment. And that's why Trigger and MAPPA can do the fuck they want?</br>  <br>But neo Gainax is not shit like Madhouse. And Trigger isn't very relevant. The only thing they did well was a 20something minutes OVA years ago.</br>  <br>That Leon vs Alfonso fight was pretty boss.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pFW<wbr>1Br_GqoQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I think their animation and visuals are absolutely fantastic, even if their stories do need some improvement.</br>  <br>why do people praise Mappa so much when they're literally just a smaller Madhouse</br>  <br>ZnT and SnB had mediocre stories but they also had godly scenery.</br>  <br>Yeah. That was awesome. There were a lot of cool action scenes.<br><br>ZnT had a brilliant OST.</br></br></br>  <br>You answered your own question.</br>  <br>Madhouse hasn't done anything good in years. Only decent work in the last years was an adaptation, Ace of Diamond, and it barely looks as an animation sometimes. On the other side, you have GAROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOO in the recent memory</wbr></br>  <br>Agreed.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Xmq<wbr>RsIudBII</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nKP<wbr>8xhGoZRk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>I had so many hopes for Trigger and they always let me down.</br>  <br>Its Yoko Kanno.

Have you all forgotten: Ishihara and Agnes Chan aren't dead yet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Land of the Free <br> Patriotic people believe that America is the most free country <br> Ranked 12th most free country below 3 Asian countries, Australia and New Zealand <br>Freedom</br></br></br></br>  <br> Twitter accounts of numerous popular manga/doujin artists, including Fatalpulse...have been shut down. <br>Good. He must be stopped.</br></br>  <br>Amerika is kanker.<br><br>Fuck TPP, Fuck the olympic. White people must die.</br></br></br>  <br>Because muh children.</br>  <br>Yeah, I love using twitter to follow mangaka, random pixiv artists, doujin artists, and seiyuu.</br>  <br>read<br/></br>  <br> 1) popular, 2) has uploaded loli/ryona art to their accounts. <br>Well Asanagi is guilty of both.</br></br>  I can't even look at lolis since Canada, but why care. it's what they do and make money doing it. their country has no laws against loli so why does it even matter.  https://twitter.com/relark/status/6<wbr>16487455026364417</wbr>  It's their fault for posting porn on Twitter when pixiv, nijie and countless other sites are there I guess.<br>Still a sad loss, though.</br>  Is kemololi allowed?  Does anyone have Shinol's patreon stuff?  <br>I'd like to commission SindoL to make a  vanilla  doujin. Maybe he would die from the strain.</br>  <br>Porn stars posting their tits and pussies don't get deleted from twitter yet fictional 2D drawings get people banned from twitter.<br><br>Fucking Americans.<br><br>Doesn't twitter still allow real life terrorist organizations to own twitters as well?<br><br>Yet why is Twitter going after Japan?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>来いよアグネス…！</br>  <br>Do you seriously think they give a fuck? I also live in Canada and have been fapping to loli for years.</br>  <br>Because they want to and they can</br>  <br>As I said mostly doujin artists. Some gravure and sfw artists as well though</br>  <br> I also live in Canada <br>Sorry for your loss</br></br>  <br>It's like a highscore. Eventually he'll just stop, get tired of all these fetishes, and loop back to zero, where he starts drawing two people that love each other very much.</br>  <br>No one cares in Canada. The only way you would get caught is if you are distributing it or are extremely blatant in ordering physical loli content from Japan.</br>  <br>And then it ramps up again, until it hits the limits of human depravity and experimentation.</br>  <br>Just don't forget that ever since, Agnes still won: lolis are redrawing from anything related to mass media.<br>Prisma Illya might be the last try of anything lolicon on TV, but I won't be surprised if they use the stick figures and make the service scenes into only jokes.</br></br>   Using Twitter in first place   <br> Yet why is Twitter going after Japan? <br><br>This is not only happening to japanese artists.</br></br></br>  Well at least this is still here. <br>https://twitter.com/UZ10</br>  <br>A wider audience than with Pixiv, I guess.</br>  It's only twitter there is many other platforms they can reach out to but twitter is the easiest.<br><br>Still don't think it's a big deal.</br></br>  <br>Such is the vicious cycle of Lawrence Shindo.<br><br>What goes on in that mind of his?<br><br>The world may never know.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>gurofags are fucked in the head</br>  But Xil was recently shut down from Tumblr for the exact same reasons.. I hope they don't find his Twitter    <br>Sure, why not.</br>  Fuck twitter.<br><br>Twitter is unsustainable as a company as well and losing money all the time.<br><br>Hope they go bankrupt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The internet in general is unsustainable.<br><br>Just think of the strain that a year of the internet being in operation puts on the environment. Probably close to what the gas emissions from the USA does every year at least.</br></br></br>   there are people that take anitwitter serious <br>what the fuck</br>  <br><br>Soon anons. Don't underestimate CIA.</br></br>  <br> Rindou <br>When is that guy going to draw a real doujin instead of cg?</br></br>  <br>Yeah, Rindou is a fucking lazy motherfucker and it pisses me off.</br>  <br>Twitter caters to SJW faggots, if you read their ToS and the reasons listed in the report system they define "harassment" as having an opposing opinion to someone else. They bend their own rules all the time to ban people for stupid reasons while letting users with large followings do whatever they want.<br>All the big websites and companies have hopped on the self-censorship bandwagon. Social media is the cancer that will destroy freedom of speech.</br></br>  <br><br>Those last few years there were some small attempts of japanese artists to reach to the west through the internet and they were shut off, there is absolutely<br>no place on the western web to sell or upload your art if you don't follow bullshit moral rules, no wonder many want their things sold in japan only.<br>Even DLsite doesn't allow loli now http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=33267039</wbr></br></br></br></br>  This is what happens when you give WAM moderation powers.<br><br>I swear, feminism should be criminalized.</br></br>  <br> Moral rules <br> Legalized gay marriage </br></br>  <br>There's nothing gay about a loli snuggling with her onii-chan</br>  <br>Thats the state of the US right now. Fags and trannies get the government and corporations to shove their shit down everyone's throats, and everyone else is sexist, racist, misogynist, etc. etc.<br><br>Honestly I'd be happy for gays to get what they want but it never stops there. They force everyone else to acccept them and the demand others are stripped of their rights to accommodate them.</br></br></br>  Shindol is sure living the life. Making $4,779.00 from patreon alone while drawing porn.  <br> The internet in general is unsustainable. <br><br>Not even close, the world is completely different now because of the internet.</br></br></br>  You guys deserve it.<br><br>/v/ and /pol/ tried to do something about the bullshit while you all just sat in your hugbox leaving the fight to others.</br></br>  <br> Social media is the cancer that will destroy freedom of speech. <br><br>Your ability to exercise speech is not severely impacted because one service bans you. You can still communicate that speech through your own independent site or other mediums. Regardless of how you feel about it, Twitter does not have to provide a platform for your speech, but they realize it is generally in their best interest to accord with principles of free speech because that helps with growth of their service. Twitter is better than most about this, but of course has its flaws, although certainly nothing like the way you defined harassment in your post.</br></br></br>  <br>Read the next handful of sentences I wrote. I'm obviously saying that it's unsustainable in regards to the environment. It's too taxing. The carbon emissions that the internet generates are immense.</br>  <br>https://www.patreon.com/shindol?ty=<wbr>h</wbr></br>  <br>The last thing we get is when the feminists proposed to blacklist and forbid all H-materials on the land of America.</br>  <br>Any reason why?<br><br>I'd read the thread, but doing it on a phone is a bitch.</br></br></br>  <br> The carbon emissions that the internet generates are immense. <br><br>The internet doesn't generate carbon emissions, it's power plants that do. It's our method of power generation that's unsustainable.<br><br>Eagerly awaiting the day a breakthrough in fusion power is made.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Even DLsite doesn't allow loli now <br>What the fuck?</br></br>  <br>They haven't allowed loli for a long time</br>  <br>Twitter was always cancer.<br><br>We should have warned the Nips years ago when they first started favoring it.</br></br></br>  <br>Theres plenty of loli on there thou.</br>  At least based Fue is okay.  <br><br>Why do I still see new loli content being added then?<br><br>http://www.dlsite.com/maniax/work/=<wbr>/product_id/RJ157224.html<br><br>http://sukebei.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;t<wbr>id=1753885</wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't that just the English DLsite? I know both don't allow toddlercon but I've never seen anything loli banned on DLsite.</br>  <br><br><br>Isn't that only English DLSite? I.E. the shit one?</br></br></br>  <br>Is this the real ones?<br>Somewhat I doubt it.</br></br>  Psychologist here, the biggest fucking irony guys.....<br><br> Loli is actually proven to repress a pedophile's desire to hurt a real child.  <br><br>I'm fucking outraged that this shit is outlawed as it makes treating several of my patients harder. <br><br>If they had some sort of outlet they would not feel so hopeless and have deep depression ontop of their pedophilic urges. <br><br>It's fucking stupid, the people who ban this shit don't care about keeping children safe, they care about their own feelings more. <br><br>Now several of my patients have other shit to treat ontop of their pedo issues, making therapy that much more difficult. Real fucking smart guys. <br><br> Pic related, what helps repress these people's urges </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are technically right, but the presence of the internet puts even more demand for energy on the table. I don't think I'm completely off-mark.</br>  <br><br>Open my link and read.</br></br>  <br>You sure showed them!</br>  <br>It's not specifically the companies or websites, but the webhosts that ban loli content because many of the cheap ones that allow porn are based in Europe. Europe is tolerant of 16+ porn, but anything younger is grounds for prosecution even if it's only a 2d image. <br><br>In the US you could theoretically host anything you wanted, except most hosts refuse to host any pornography at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Who's being stripped of their rights? Not trying to argue, just curious.</br>  <br>Well no one actually gives a fuck about the children, it just sounds good. Also going after pedophilia related crimes is much easier than actually finding criminals and it looks good for their career too.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Nope.<br><br>http://www.dlsite.com/ecchi-eng/wor<wbr>k/=/product_id/RE157224.html<br><br><br><br>Care to summarize? I only have google translate and it isn't exactly the most accurate tool.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe I'm just an unreasonably cynical guy, but I don't really buy your story about being a psychologist.<br><br>I'm not saying anything about the psychological pluses or minuses of loli-consumption, but this is clearly bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br>You try too hard.</br>  <br>DLSite didn't let this artist sell his doujin on their site because of the 4-year olds getting fucked in it.</br>  <br>They told him to remove all lolishota pages or change them if he wanted to sell it, then he didn't and sold it on DMM.</br>  <br>Its still freedom you fucking europoor, do property owners not have rights?</br>  <br>That's because that toddlercon. DLsite doesn't allow toddlercon.</br>  Is it really because of loli or is this related to TPP?  <br> You are technically right, but the presence of the internet puts even more demand for energy on the table. <br><br>I think the benefits the internet provides outweighs the carbon emissions.<br><br>Emissions need to be dealt with at the source: the actual generators.</br></br></br></br></br>   Murrica   <br>What, you think it's unreasonable that a psych might watch other anime and happened to stumble on this thread and get a little interested because he has patients?<br><br>Man, i'm just looking for what's good this season to watch. <br><br><br><br>I'm against real CP since it obviously has real kids involved but there's way more good done by drawn loli than there is harm. <br><br>Letting them get off is far more preferable to them snapping and hurting a child. <br><br>And that's not even taking into account freedom of speech.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>TPP hasn't been finalized. I sincerely doubt it's a preemptive measure related to that.</br>  <br> Psychologist <br><br>Psychology is literally just as believable and scientifically proven as homeopathy.<br>Get out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey, I'm just saying that I find it dubious. I'm not going to lube up your ass and then rape you as punishment for making a somewhat unbelievable post.</br>  <br><br><br>More money for DMM then.<br><br><br><br> That's because that toddlercon. DLsite doesn't allow toddlercon. <br><br>There's toddlercon on dlsite.<br><br>http://www.dlsite.com/maniax/work/=<wbr>/product_id/RJ144879.html<br><br>http://www.dlsite.com/maniax/work/=<wbr>/product_id/RJ080923.html</wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And here's a cited source.<br><br>http://www.sciencedaily.com/release<wbr>s/2010/11/101130111326.htm<br><br> In addition, the study finds that the incidence of child sex abuse has fallen since 1989, when child pornography became readily accessible. <br><br><br>But crime statistics are not? <br><br>You get the fuck out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Loli or maybe toddlercon, I'm not really sure anymore. I still see a bunch of artists still on twitter posting loli, maybe it's only if she looks like she is in kindergarten that they go after you?</br>  <br>Well either way, i'm here to find some good reccomendations. <br><br>I'm not here to argue with imbeciles who think they know better than crime statistics and peer-reviwed studies. <br><br>Loli is harmless and i provided a citation here. <br><br>Now can someone tell me what's worth checking out this season?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Twitter banned porn from Vine entirely last year and have since been discussing making Twitter a safer space in the near future.<br><br>The future is now.</br></br></br>  <br>Its case to case obviously, the person who reviewed it had a problem with toddlercon or loli so he rejected it, it's more scary because it's a japanese website.</br>  <br>Overlord seems  fun </br>  <br> Now can someone tell me what's worth checking out this season? <br><br>Go float off and view some other threads on that.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't think it's that scary, there's no real "steam" in Nippon that can claim a monopoly in nipland, there are dozens of these distribution platforms that can pick and choose what they want to sell on their site.<br><br>You can either go to another site or host/sell your game by yourself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doctor, my dark evil desires are acting up. Can you post more... help... to help me repress it?</br>  <br> But crime statistics are not? <br>I don't care about crime statistics, it's your points that are inherently weak.<br><br>If you ask me, the problem is simply related to the american mentality, though it's not like here in Yurop we're any better in that regards.<br><br>What strikes me most is that you guys have all sort of bullshit myths about attention deficit disorders, autism and all that but still the vast majority of psychologist/psychiatrists dismiss people who admit being pedophiles and seek treatment like degenerate criminals.<br>I mean, why does the government support helping transgender and stuff and still doesn't help honest men that admit having problems and don't want to hurt anyone?<br>I just fail to understand that.<br><br>And for the record, outlets aren't going to solve the problem, it's just sweeping dust under the rug most of the times.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Nyu's still around. Everything is right in the world.  <br>Give this man 200cc's of loli, Stat!</br>  <br>Would you consider yourself to be a crazy person?</br>  <br>/v/ please go back to talking about shit video games (which are all of them).</br>   America <br> free <br> implying the country that advocates for the right to invade the privacy of their own people and other countrys is free </br></br>  "Land of the free" they said<br>"Home of the brave" they said</br>  <br> Land of the free <br> Home of the brave <br><br>Do people really believe this?</br></br></br></br>  Is Twitter really cracking down on loli or is this panic, as usual, thanks to guesswork filling in the blanks? Because,<br>https://twitter.com/syoujikimura<br>Would you look at that, loli. I remembered seeing Twitter being mentioned somewhere in this guy's pixiv a while ago, went there to check and everything still seems to be there. Oh no loli is kill.<br>Twitter is still shit though.</br></br></br>  <br>Twitter was never known for being thorough. <br><br>They probably opened a bunch of his images and saw dogs and youtube videos and moved on. I bet all it'd take is a few reports to take him out though.</br></br></br>  <br>Gays, trannies, SJWs, and feminists don't stop at equal rights. They fire up the outrage machine and use social media to shame politicians and corporations to ban whatever they don't like. Look at the Confederate flag shit right now. State governments and most major corporations are taking it down and hiding it, and for what? Banning the choice flag of southern rednecks isn't going to bring back the people shot in that church or stop the racial tension in America. <br>No one even had to pass a law, but censorship and atracks on free expression are still getting accomplished.</br></br>  Moralfags should be illegal.  <br>They still have the fucking ISIS on twitter. They change accounts often, but it's not like twitter stopped them.<br><br>What's ISIS stance on loli? Burn drawings, marry real kids?</br></br></br>   no more self portrait of favorite artist <br><br>i fucking hate burgerland</br></br>  <br>lol</br>  <br>Why are Fatalpulse girls just so fuckable?<br><br>I mean, the first thing that came to mind when I saw OP's picture is that I want to see that face drowning in pleasure from getting dicked.<br><br>You don't even see tits and ass in OP's picture. But it's still so sexual.<br><br>I guess I've been conditioned to getting boners whenever I see fatalpulse girls.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've known plenty of people that caught bullshit bans. Twitter is full of hugboxes and cliques. Twitter isn't the only place like that either. It's all great in your eyes until something you like gets pulled from the places you frequent.</br>  <br>I want to untie that knot.</br>  <br>ISIS are huge plebs so they'd probably burn it.</br>  <br>Didn't someone ask them something related to anime once, and they called him a retard? They seem to be pretty no fun allowed, I bet they hate loli and don't care about that loli harem they'd get after they died.</br>  <br>NO!</br>  <br>Such hypocrites they are. Nobody ever stands up for the BLT and pretend we don't even exist.</br>  <br>It's not uniformly enforced, but I still believe it to be better than most. I'm a ferocious lolicon and even if Twitter moves to ban loli, it doesn't really faze me. They're a publicly traded company that has to bend to stockholders and advertisers. There is elsewhere I can get that content. When it becomes a criminal issue, that's when you should start sounding alarms.</br>  <br>Is this real?</br>  <br> pretty no fun allowed <br><br>I'm sure they don't see it that way. Especially when you consider their videos.</br></br></br>  <br> bleach  <br> attack on titan <br>Well it's a start</br></br></br>  <br> not following Ume-tentei <br>Are you prude or something?<br><br>https://twitter.com/umeaoki</br></br></br></br>  <br>ISIS confirmed shit-taste.</br>  <br> puts on the environment <br>Go back to gaia</br></br>  <br><br>There are groups of like-minded individuals on twitter who set up spam accounts to follow people they don't like, then report them for using spam accounts to boost their follower count.
