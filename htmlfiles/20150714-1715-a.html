[ So we all agree Crocodile  is the most attractive genderbend  will save Doflamingo from this predicament.<br>The risk for Doflamingo to be killed by CP in prison is much too great, someone will have to bail him out as early as possible.</br>  Post yfw Luffy OHKO'd the Pacifista  <br>Sure, why not. But guess what, by round two, Luffy would have found some way to take him out, be it pure skill or some weakness exploit. That's kind of the OP formula. The best similar case being the fight with Crocodile. Hell, you can look at the citizens keeping Luffy alive for those 10 min as Robin saving him after his first fight with Crocodile.</br>  <br>Progress.</br>  <br>Kek. Dat filename.</br>  <br>This<br>Kek</br></br>  How was he still in one piece after being hit in the chest with pure magma? Shouldn't it have burned him into two?  How many of you buy/support the anime series/movies/LNs you love so much?<br><br>Pic related. Biggest guilty pleasure I've ever had the pleasure of watching. It's safe to say though I'm never buying anything from Aniplex ever again, not even for Fate, not even for Madoka</br></br>  Just pre-ordered volume 1 of one punch man  <br>I try not to waste too much money on it, but I love the idea of supporting the industry</br>  <br>Planning to buy the rest of the series?<br> mfw I bought and read the first two hardcovers of the Haruhi LNs and realize how much of a gigantic cunt she is <br>Got rid of them, I regret nothing</br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty ridiculous, but unless a series hasn't been licensed and released over here, I will only watch series I buy. As far as manga go, I only buy Tezuka stuff or relatively short series that interest me. Such an expensive hobby, but I take some comfort in the fact that most of it has become much more expensive than when I bought it, so I'm just sitting on a gold mine.</br>  <br>Been quite a while. I did buy Saber Marionette J, J Again, and J-to-X though. Also, I find myself getting tired of moving so many videos and books every couple years, because they take a ton of space and weigh so much, and having a heavy preference for digital things I can store on a HDD and read/watch off my android tablet.</br>  Find me a better fight in anime.<br><br> you can't </br></br>  <br> They then had to go and ruin it by having Sasuke get up to Rock Lee's speed without weights in one month of training, whereas Lee has spent his entire life focusing on that one aspect <br>angry feels<br> hurr sharingan <br>even lee told sasuke that it doesnt matter if you can see if your body cant react fast enough. what bullshit</br></br></br></br>    <br>I would have been okay with Sasuke replicating his speed- if there were limits. Like maybe he could reproduce his moves, but his body was not capable of keeping the movement rate up for more than a minute.<br><br>Instead, he seemed to not have any fucking limits.It was bullshit.<br><br>There's nothing wrong with having a TASKMASTER esque copy character, but he needs to have limits to not be stupid broken.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Kishi had a hard on for Sasook. what do yoh expect. Naruto would have been a GOAT series if it didnt have either of them, and especially none of that destined reincarnation conclusion zombie war shit. The war was ok, but rehashing liteeally every pivotal death? kishi a shiti</br></br>  <br>This show's art and animation is incredibly over rated.<br>The movements are smooth, but the characters and props have very limited detail in most of teh scenes, to the point that some fights look like struggles between blobs that have taken human silhouettes.</br></br>   She sees your   shirt size    2xlt <br><br> s <br>lmao<br><br>My fucking 90 grandpa is a medium and he's 5'3 fucking kek.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah in socal.
