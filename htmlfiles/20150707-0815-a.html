I like that sunny disposition.<br> Fuck <br>Mami, because duh.<br> Kill <br>Homura, fuck that bitch.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Marry Kyoko<br>Fuck all of them<br>Kill Homushit<br><br>I'd rape Homura so bad she'd be mindbroken, then I'd let Madoka murder her because she hates her. Nobody cares about Homura and I'm glad to see everyone here picks her to kill as well. Nobody would miss her. It's nice to know 99% of the remaining fanbase wants to see the unloved worthless cunt suffer and die too. Also good knowing everyone on Earth knows Madoka never loved her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kyouko doesn't like you at all. She says you're annoying.</br>  <br>She despises Homura too like everyone else. Literally nobody wants Homura to live.</br>  <br>She still says you're annoying.</br>  <br>Marry Madoka<br>Fuck Mami<br>Kill Homura.</br></br></br>  <br>!Akemi pls go and stay go.</br>  <br>Who cares, as long as everyone hates Homura like this thread proves I don't care what people make of me.</br>  <br>I don't hate Homura. Neither does Kyouko. She tells me you are annoying for projecting.</br>  Marry Mami<br>Fuck Nagisa<br>Kill Homura</br></br>  <br> 5 of them <br> 3 options <br><br>fuck them all<br>marry Kyouko<br>behead Mami</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Fuck Homura<br>Marry Madoka <br>Kill Kyouko</br></br>  <br>Look at this thread. Everyone wants Homura dead. The Madoka fanbase as a whole DESPISES her and wants her dead. These people know that Madoka has never once cared about her and the whole cast loathes her. We all want to watch Homura suffer for once in her spoiled life and die alone like she deserves.</br>  <br>Well then, if that's the case, she can stay over at my place. I can serve her food with Kyouko.</br>  Don't ever sexualize megucas you pathetic sick fucks!!!!! RRREEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!  <br>She would call you shit and torment Kyoko. She is rotten to the core and totally degenerate. She deserves to die and Kyoko will enjoy driving a spear through her loveless heart.</br>  <br> Look at this thread <br><br>I know, it's horrible. Why can't you people just have these like once a week?<br><br><br> that post number </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Marry madoka<br>Fuck homu <br>Kill kyouko because she's a shit</br></br>  <br>Really? She is loving my steaks. Weird because you never see Homura eat so it was a shocker to Kyouko and I.<br><br><br>You can't take my soul, devil. It is already in Kyouko's possession.</br></br></br></br>  <br>People shitpost, and need to be reminded that Madoka never loved Homura "The Worst Slut Of All Time" Akemi. The fanbase hates her and wants her gone. Fans everywhere constantly ask when they will get to see Homura die and be abandoned by Madoka.</br>  <br>Just wear trip or at least behave like other one.</br>  <br>Marry Homu<br>Fuck Madoka<br>Kill Sayaka</br></br></br>  <br>You should just ditch the trip.<br>It's obvious who you are without it.</br></br>  <br>Who would I behave like? Besides, people complain about trips and it's not like the others are here.</br>  What a bunch of losers am I right  <br>Nice fake, contrarian post. I saw the counter not go up. We all hate Homura and want her to die.</br>  <br>Sure.</br>  <br><br>Not gay, only friends. Just like how Madoka never loved Homura in any way.</br></br>  <br>Kyouko ver. of Kevin?<br>I don't mint your trip tho.</br></br>  Marry and fuck Sayaka. Ignore the rest.<br><br>Seriously Sayaka is fucking cute. Her sunny attitude is great and I bet she's either feisty in the bedroom and fucks like a tiger, or goes really shy and submissive, which is also really sexy.<br><br>Sayaka a cute!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Friends like you'll never have since you're an autist.</br>  <br><br>Yes, they can never understand that  KyouAppl  is inseparable.<br><br><br>Yes. <br><br><br>Sick burn.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How do tigers fuck? Anyway</br>  <br>Like Sayaka!</br>  <br>Apparently he knows. Must be experienced with tigers.</br>  <br>Of course, Kyouko loves apples.</br>  <br>Marry madoka.  cuddle  madoka.<br>Kill  homuhater </br></br>  <br>I have a lot of friends. Unlike Homura who is hated by everyone in the show snd the fanbase. Even the staff hate her. She's a cancer on the world and should be ridiculed, like Jar Jar.<br><br>She deserves to die and should have been left to be torn to shreds by that one witch Madoka stupidly saved her from.<br> hey Mami-san, that girl is getting eaten <br> who cares, that's that Akemi slut <br> oh, okay, she doesn't matter </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My heart</br>  <br><br><br>Marry Aoi<br>Fuck Aoi<br>Kill everyone who's not voiced by Aoi</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Madoka shooting Homura to death because she never loved her when?</br>  <br>I feel weird looking at that image. I feel like if I didn't wake up from that dream, it would've ended like that.<br><br><br>Only correct answer if you change it to you prefered meguca.</br></br></br></br>  <br>SHOT THROUGH THE HEART<br>AND YOU'RE TO BLAME, MADO<br>YOU GIVE AI YO A BAD NAME</br></br></br>  <br>Considering the fact that Homura did something wrong, i'd say Madoka will take her to an empty building were she will promptly shoot Homuras heart with a  cupid  arrow.</br>  <br>And it will torture her violently until Homura dies as Madoka turns her back on her and abandons her, because she never loved her and Homura is insignificant to everyone's lives.<br><br>Glad you hate Homura and know Madoka never loved her as well.</br></br></br>  <br>marry Mami<br>fuck Homu<br>kill Kyouko</br></br></br>  <br>There is a reason Madoka took her to an empty building.<br><br> I'm sorry fluffs. I know I posted the image with ill intention againts !Akemi, but I can't let him warp my post. </br></br></br>  <br> kill <br> fuck <br> marry dead body <br> there's something wrong with me isn't there? </br></br></br></br>  <br>Pic unrelated right? She took her in there to kill and abandon, where nobody would find her because nobody will miss her. I don't see what non canon doujinshi shipping between two characters who despise each other has to do with Madoka murdering Homura.</br>  <br>Pic very related.<br> doujinshi </br></br>  <br>I want to turn Sallaca's pussy into an utter mess.</br>  <br>Becareful, cats can scratch. While you perform your acts with said cat, Sayaka and I will watch you get scratched. We'll also invite whoever Sallaca is.</br>  <br>Yes that degenerate image is from a terroble doujin where Madoka loves Homura. Obviously it can't be related to anything because Madoka hated Homura and will murder her as your scenario illustrated.</br>  I would marry Homu but as I am not Madoka I cannot give her the happiness she deserves.<br><br>So I would probably kill Sayaka. Fuck Kyouko and marry Mami. Kyouko seems like she would be down for a random fuck just to see what dick is like. Mami seems like a good waifu although I don't have any real feelings for her.<br><br>If I were to become Madoka though I would Fuck Homura, Marry Homura, and save everybody.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What's a terroble? Anyway that image is very canon.</br>  <br>You really need to find some new hobbies.</br>  <br><br>He won't. He actually thinks he is being funny. Although as long as he is having fun I guess I can ignore him. Not like we have any groundbreaking discussions in these threads anymore that are getting ignored due to his shitposting.</br></br>  <br>I'll ignore now.</br>  <br>No because Madoka canonically as stated by the creators never loved Homura in any way.<br><br><br>I have hobbies, like playing b-ball.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cool. My hobby is satisfying Kyouko's cravings.</br>  <br>With your dick.</br>  <br>Then go outside and shove a ball up your ass<br><br>Anyway, I'm done replying to you.</br></br></br>    <br> implying he isn't filled to the brim with balls </br>  <br>best plan.</br>  <br> mad that Madoka never loved Homura in any way and the fanbase hates her </br>  <br>My hobby is saving all cute madoka pics that I don't have. Care to help me with my hobby?</br>  Marry: kyoko, because she is the least of a fuckup<br>Fuck : madongles, because she is a but of a fuck up<br>Kill: mamaries, homo, dumbfuck stupidface, because they are all huge fuck ups</br></br>  Apple-chan, I have a question.<br>How do you live with the fact that in your life time there is a very real chance that Kyouko will be confirmed as a lesbian?<br>Isn't the stress of that becoming true at any possible minute absolutely debilitating?</br></br>    <br>Sure.<br><br><br>I will answer that if Kyouko and Sayaka confesses.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kyoko never loved Sayaka just like Madoka never loved Homura.</br>  !GMeguca, what would you do with a  tiny  Madoka?  <br>Marry Sayaka to Kyouko<br>Fuck Homu<br>Kill OP</br></br></br>  <br>Do you accept pairs?</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure he specified Madoka Kaname.</br>  <br> Madoka in the outfit of an unloved slut who has no character and ruined everything <br><br>Nobody would save that tbh</br></br></br>    <br>That kind of defeats the purpose of the question, but whatever.</br>  <br><br>Thanks<br><br>Yes. But only if madoka is involved.<br><br>Everything. I'd lift her up gently if she needed help reaching something if you catch my drift.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You have great taste anon.</br>  <br>Kinda hard to tell when the series is named after her.</br>  <br>Oh well.<br><br><br>She can't reach the cookies?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Marry Mami<br>Fuck Homura<br>Kill Homura</br></br></br>  <br>Not when she's that short</br>  <br>rape rape rape rape rape<br><br>correct answer</br></br></br>   she sees !GMeguca at the park   <br>You weren't going to get anything but it was worth a shot.</br>  <br>So then what doyou mean?<br><br><br>I enjoy being indirect.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Hhnngggg. Curse this 3d reality<br><br>Something lewd.</br></br></br>  <br>Actually, better yet.<br>instead of having another image dumping thread just go to /c/ and find the Madoka Kaname thread there.</br></br>  <br>Can I just have Homura fuck me to death.</br>  <br>You make me want to post out of my heart, but my mind refuses.</br>  <br><br>Are you Madoka?</br></br>  <br><br>People really want Homura's seeds.</br></br>  <br>I actually checked last night and it was gone. Guess I should make a new one</br>  <br>Sure, why not? I made the group pic thread though it's very dead.</br>  <br> Marry <br>Kyouko<br><br> Fuck <br>Mami<br>Sayaka<br><br> Fuck then kill <br>Homu<br><br> Kill while fucking <br>Madoka</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can also look up their archives.<br>First few threads should cover ya.</br></br>  Marry Sayaka<br>Fuck Mami<br>Kill Kyouko</br></br>    <br>Threads are painfully slow on /c/.<br>Threads last months<br><br>Didn't think of that. Thanks</br></br></br></br>  If I killed Homura would Madoka marry me as thanks? I would take advantage of that benefit.  <br>Im prob more like Kyoko. I dunno if Madoka would want to be fucked so hard she might die.</br>  <br><br>Well more of Homura would not fuck anyone but Madoka. And I doubt he would fuck her to death and not just unconsciousness. But I think that is close enough to what you want.</br></br>  <br>No, because she's already married to me</br>  Which should Madoka wear? Would you get her something else?  <br>this is correct<br><br> mami's dead anyway ;_;[\spoiler] </br></br></br>  <br> another waifufag <br><br>Whoop-dee-fucking-doo</br></br></br>  <br><br> not waifuing a meguca <br><br>pls</br></br></br></br>  <br>The answer is obvious.

It's degeneracy.</br></br></br>  <br>You know and i both know it's cute. <br><br>I would stand in front of a crowd of thousands and declare my love for madoka.</br></br></br>  <br>So would I.

After all, if the franchise can't even get an anime right anywhere, if it shows that it doesn't care for its fanbase, it probably isn't worth following to begin with.

Yadokari and Bob (see: Nachi K2) can be equally guilty of this.</br></br>  <br>But Nachi was meant to be drawn like that, I dont believe anyone exists that looks at Ashigara's face only and say they cant identify its gender, or are you saying shibafuships are boys with tits and its fine?</br>  <br>Nachi is handsome.</br>    <br>Cute</br>  <br>He looks like the dude from Jormungand, obviously not the MC, the other one.</br>  <br> I dont believe anyone exists that looks at Ashigara's face only and say they cant identify its gender <br>You were talking about the faces, not the bodies. Put Ashigara's head on a male body/head and it'd just look like any other androgynous anime boy.<br> or are you saying shibafuships are boys with tits and its fine? <br>I'm saying you're imposing a strange double standard, since as far as anime goes any face (no matter how feminine) can just be conceived as male.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I was talking about the faces only, not sure what are you trying to quote there, but I could agree that with a male body they could look right, but you have to admit that, of all the kancolle artist's faces, shibafu ones are the most "genderless" ones.<br>And I dont feel that I have double standards, I just dont like shibafu and I was explaining some valid points of mine, thats all.</br></br>  <br>your reply</br>  I don't like Shibafu's art but I love Kaga, what's wrong with me guys?  <br> but you have to admit that, of all the kancolle artist's faces, shibafu ones are the most "genderless" ones. <br>I don't. Most of the kancolle artists don't draw masculine males much. Judging their ability to draw male faces by their female faces is a silly argument to make. If anything, Yadokari is the most "genderless."</br></br>  <br>your reply</br>    <br><br>Samefag</br></br>  we never got scans of them  <br>That Kaga is beautiful, thanks a lot Shibafu</br>    <br>I somehow prefer other artists' Kaga to the original's.

A thread's up  but it's in the 400s so I'll start a new one.<br><br>Boku no Hero Academia </br></br>            Looks messy.              Shit, I am so hungry now.  <br>I know right? Where are your napkins, Souma?</br>    What a fucking cunt.      <br>Yugi is a great villain.</br>  So he's planning a sorta word of mouth deal, making people want to find the location of an ever-moving cart?  <br>Megumi will never learn.</br>  <br>That'd be pretty interesting, yeah.</br>  <br>He could gain notoriety from it, but isn't he registered to that area? It might be a large area but its not like he can go campus wide with it</br>  <br>Glorious bastard.</br>  <br>Either that, or he's just closing early to get a "limited time" effect.</br>  <br>Yeah, but as long as he doesn't intrude the spaces of the other booths, I think its perfectly fine for him to do so. Besides, his pie being priced at a price of a plum tik slots in nicely within the price range in the main street.</br>  <br><br>World Trigger </br></br>  <br><br>I predict that he waited until yugi was gone and he's gonna set up in his empty booth for mad customers.<br>Or maybe I'm dumb.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think he can afford to close early; he'd need every second available till closing time, if he wants to outrank Yugi on a certain day.</br>  <br>He could do 1 flavor/type of peppered bun per day. People hear about X type bun but missed their opportunity so they for sure don't want to miss the next flavor</br>  <br>That's not a good idea. It'll eat more into his resources. What he needs now is publicly.</br>  why do people call Kuga Yugi?  <br>Yugioh hair, looks like this guy.</br>    <br>Because his hair looks like Yugi's.</br>  <br>He registered his booth to be across from Kuga's one, and we even got some Shokugekis because of the disputed of the places. Soma going around the festival with his mobile booth would be unfair for the other students and would feel like an asspull to me.</br>  <br>You should instead ask why people are calling him by his first name.</br>  <br><br><br>i guess im just retarded</br></br></br>  <br>If he's elusive to find and builds up a reputation, he can concentrate his customers on one day and beat Yugi then, maybe?</br>  <br>Unfair in what way? He's not gonna intrude their space or anything? There's plenty of empty spaces &amp; walkways in the areas.</br>  <br>Because he has to pass by some booth, and therefore he would attract customers that otherwise would have eaten in there, and he's the only one that can afford to do that because his booth is a mobile one.<br>Also if he can dick around with his cart what was the purpose of registering to get a fixated spot?</br></br>  <br>So that people wouldn't intrude on his space. Is it that hard to picture?</br>  <br> Souma plotting <br>It's over Yugi</br></br>  <br>I don't read that series, but all I know is that pompadour guy is my favorite.</br>  <br><br>Naruto Gaiden, Black Clover, Blue Exorcist DDL </br></br>  <br>Nobody has any idea what Souma's planning.<br><br>That means his victory is in the bag.</br></br></br>  <br>And if he moves his cart around he will unavoidably intrude in other's area, is it that hard to picture?</br>  <br>Not if he keeps to the roads and paths between booths.</br>  Calling it now, Yugi makes more money, but Souma ends with a greater number of costumers served.  <br>Whatever dude, it's clear we cannot reach an agreement. Let's not derail this   and instead let's praise Hisako  </br>  Souma's background is a special of the day shop. On the other hand, we've only seen him working on the one dish. It's possible though, that he plans to mix around the insides of the buns, offering different fillings every day.  People are really gonna pay 50 bucks for Erina's food?  <br> Equivalent of 50 murrican dollars. <br> For a gourmet dish made by one of the top students of one of the best culinary schools. <br>Seems reasonable to me.</br></br></br>  <br>or more. She's undoubtedly serving something worth it though. The real question is Isshiki and the PSDs potluck.<br><br>but then, he's already got the old ladies lining up, the scoundrel.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I honestly dont know why people try to doubt Erina's abilties<br><br>she might be cunt but she got the ability to back it up, all of it up</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She charges way more just for testing food.<br>Her cooking skills are some of the best in the academy.</br></br>  <br>I fucking love this asshole.</br>  <br>The prices for the areas are just guidelines, Souma's charging 500 yen when his area's prices are 1000-5000 after all. I bet Isshiki won't be charging that much.</br>  <br>Indeed, she needs to bind her hair to make sure it doesn't flip up when she does</br>  <br>she can back it up to me, amiriteguise?</br>  <br>Erina is literally perfect in every way. It's pretty easy to understand.</br>  <br> Erina is literally perfect in every way <br>Spoken like a true Erinafag. She's very indeed skilled chef and with God's Tongue to boot. Erina is anything but perfect.</br></br>  <br>obligatory chuckle</br>  <br>Everyone involved in Tootsuki events seems well-off if not fucking rich.

Red-haired Cinderella sounds interesting  isn't the manga quite good?  <br>i'm hyped, from the PV the animation looks so beautiful and Bones is doing this</br>  Okay, which one of you are responsible for this garbage?  <br>Wrong thread?</br>  <br>PV 2 looks better<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XzX<wbr>LibJm6GE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> comeback of Yona <br>Fuck off and kill yourself.<br><br>Dont compare the gem that is Akagami to shit like Yona. Its like saying Legend of Galactic Heroes is comeback of Legend of Legendary Heroes (not that the Bones will not fuck up the adaptation)</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yona&gt;Akagami.<br>By a mile.</br></br>  <br>Its great. One of best political shoujo period - in line of 12 Kingdoms, Saiunkoku Monogatari, Fushigi Yuugi. But its Bones.</br>  Fuck, they should fire that seiyu, her character doesn't match the voice for the female guard.<br><br><br>And I loved the song, you know the song name anon?</br></br></br>  <br>If its on the same level as 12 kindowms then i'm reading this right the fuck now<br>Thanks anon.</br></br>  <br> look! i am newfag for whome yona was babies first "historical fantasy" shoujo <br>Yona is infinitely inferior subpar clone of Saiunkoku Monogatari. Not ever worth mentioning unless you are complete newfag that did not watch anything else.</br></br>  A show that actually looks kind of all around good, yeah fat chance getting anyone here to pay any attention.  <br>I would say that Akagami is bereft of the political intrigue in these manga and is hence fundamentally different. There is little lingering conflict and things are a bit more sedate. Still a fun read.</br>  <br> political <br>Dropped</br></br>  <br>It is OP theme of the anime "Yashashii Kibou" by Saori Hayami <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3so<wbr>7XzFbmD0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>There is plenty of political intrigue. Its just the MC does not suddenly become minister of state or something like that having all centuring around her. She is support for Zen, who in turn is pawn of his brother. They get involved in lots of political stuff, just not always on first roles.</br>  Aw man, I was expecting some heavy feels with this, but MC girl basically falls in love with the guy after the first chapter.<br><br>Fuck.</br></br>  <br>Why is that bad?</br>  <br>She is not really anon, they are just friends.</br>  <br>Well, things are clearly not as sinister, complex or heavy in Akagami. It is nevertheless a very comfy manga, but clearly departs from the themes explored by 12 Kingdoms, Saiunkoku and even Yona.</br>  <br>There is no struggle with romance - they love each other and its a fact. The problem is that she`s a simple medic and he`s a prince - there are all kind of problems approaching her to him without causing trouble.<br><br><br>i`d say its very near to Saiunkoku in premise. As far sinister goes - there are assassination plots, plague, war, pirates kidnapping, court intrigues etc. Though indeed, it did not result in anything truly tragic and drastic yet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah. They become best friends before any actual romance happens. I kinda like how low-key their relationship is, they just realize they want to be together and it all happens without any misunderstandings or other typical shoujo bullshit. It's refreshing.</br>  <br>They declare their love in a forest and kiss anon. Come on, I've read this, don't pull shit out of your ass.</br>  <br>this is the best kind of romance</br>  <br>Because of Ore Monogatari.</br>  <br>WHAT the fuck does this have to do with Idle Activities?</br>  The only downside of this manga is the typical shoujo one - litterally EVERYONE falls for Shirayuki.<br><br>I get it, she`s cute, nice and has unique hair - but there are two prince ready to marry her, people easily influenced by her right after meeting her etc.<br><br>Though manga does good by showing other side too: some people clearly think little of her, some just consider concubine approached so Zen could play with her, some trow hard checks if she`s worthy and can survive the environment.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seriously. The author even takes a situation that is usually milked for MISUNDERSTANDINGS and drama, and has the female MC just go "Oh, I thought there was probably an explanation for it."</br>  <br>Akagami thankfully does not limit itself to two lovebirds staring each others for dozen chapters. There plenty of stuff happening.<br><br>Hell, the manga even took the most risky turn for shoujo at all - separated them for years.</br></br></br>  <br> litterally EVERYONE <br>Why can't Ameriburgers figure out how to use "literally" correctly?</br></br>  I was reading the first Volume ages ago in a local bookstore, honestly it was pretty fucking neat. Looking forward to the Anime, hoping for some comfy medieval adventure time maybe like a road trip.  <br>I wouldn't say everyone falls for her. Just Zen, Raji, and Obi. And Obi wants Zen's dick, too, so whatever.</br>  Is this 12 ep long or 24?  <br>Why do i get this feeling i've seen this on sadpanda<br>God i hate when this happens</br></br>  It's one of the shoujo manga I'm reading (bc I'm very picky with shoujo and I don't read many) so I'm very hyped about this adaption even though I'm not a big fan of the character design.  <br>Nothing really happens in this version, though. She didn't jump to any conclusions and readily accepts the explanation given.</br>  <br><br> local bookstore <br>You japanese?</br></br></br>  <br> literally <br> 1. in the literal or strict sense <br> 2. in a literal manner; word for word <br> 3. actually; without exaggeration or inaccuracy <br> 4. in effect; in substance; very nearly; virtually <br>http://dictionary.reference.com/bro<wbr>wse/literally</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, german.

Sadly most of it is Yaoi or BL stuff since this shit sells to the female teenage crowd like crazy.</br>  <br> her character doesn't match the voice for the female guard. <br>At first I was like you but then it grew on me, now I like the VA for Kiki.</br></br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-07-06/snow-white-with-the-re<wbr>d-hair-anime-to-have-2-split-season<wbr>s/.90118</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Nice. I still dont trust Bones until i see it.</br>  <br>Exactly, you're using the word wrong. Saying literally everyone is in love with her would mean characters such as Kiki is in love with her as well, which is blatantly untrue.</br>  Why do I always turn into such a fag when I read stuff like this?  Its a manga where all characters chatter "when will they finally fuq?" behind MCs back.<br><br>In before Zen`s brother actually set`s a demand that if Zen wants to marry Shiroyuki, he needs to make an offspring.</br></br>  People will pick it up for Shiroyuki and stay for Kiki.  Obi reminds me of Hak, forever a cuck.  I can't believe a Shirayuki-hime thread actually took off for once.<br><br> in b4 only 18 posters <br>Still better than usual.</br></br></br>  <br>is shirayuki hime the new argevollen</br>  <br> 4. in effect; in substance; very nearly; virtually </br>  <br>I don't know what that is, so probably.</br>  <br>Because you are a fag</br>  <br> idle activties </br>  <br><br><br>Akagami has been translated up to the latest volume in chink.

And Raji already falls for her since the beginning</br>  <br>Still untrue in context with the story. It was a big exaggaration, no matter how you try to defend it.</br>  <br>I just realize that Zen's brother is voiced by Akira Ishida</br>  <br>No, because argevollen was genuine boring trash.</br>  <br>You are the one who pull shit out of your ass. There is no declaration of love or kiss in first chapter.</br>  <br>I was not talking about the first chapter, but the ones that follow.</br>  <br><br>What is it with red haired heroines that tugs at the sense of fantasy, romance, and adventure?</br></br>  <br> The only downside of this manga is the typical shoujo one - litterally EVERYONE falls for Shirayuki. <br><br>If she's going to be a character like Snow White, a Disney-tier "princess", it hedges closer to the material that everyone falls for her.</br></br></br>  <br> Akagami <br> political </br></br>  <br>Snow White/Cinderella are shit character types. Those are plain and dumb persons that through miracle gets everyoen loving them and attention.<br><br>Shiroyuki is the opposite type - the hard working one, the capable: the one that has to prove all the time she deserves the place she is at.</br></br></br>  <br> Akagami <br> not political </br></br>  Please cover the entire manga, please cover the entire manga. I'm resisting the urge to read this so I can get the best possible experience.  <br>Its two cour, but i doubt it`ll cover entire manga (its still ongoing).<br><br>Saiunkoku Monogatari was 75 episodes long, and it still did not cover the whole novels, stopping at most interesting stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>Manga will be inevitably better than anime.

Threads about it gonna be hype.  Sexual intercourse confirmed.  Delayed with days thanks to Funi.  <br>You're kidding me, it says 4h 53m in anichart.</br>  <br>I see, you are new as shit.</br>  <br>Sasuga Funi. Raws it is.</br>  <br>Mondays will never have good anime.</br>  <br> nnb <br> not good </br></br>  <br>It is really not.</br>  <br>anichart is the time it airs in Japan, the subs are delayed by Funi</br>  Maybe someone will sub it instead of waiting for Funi. Maybe.  <br> looks so beautiful  <br> and Bones is doing this </br></br>  <br>They just kiss anon, you never kiss like that, didn't you?</br>  <br>Yes. Get hype.</br>  <br>Have faith in Ando</br>  <br>How delayed? If it's just a two or three days I guess waiting is fine.</br>  <br>Let's hope for the best, anon.</br>  <br>Fuck you Funi</br>  <br>Good</br>  <br>Fine. It's political but without actual politics.</br>  <br>But it's not. It's generic sure as far its premise goes, but its execution is overall decent. One of the better mecha series last year and I liked it far more than the rest.</br>  <br>I'm okay with raw, since we have the translated manga so can at least understand the scenes.</br>  <br>How many days? Where are you seeing this</br>  <br> summer is only a meme </br>  <br>Funi has barely subbed new shows so far, Chaos Dragon, Dandellion and Logos's subs still aren't out yet.<br><br>Anyone who wants to catch the live streaming of episode 1<br>It is in 3 hours 22 minutes</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kinda wish I'd understand Moon now.</br>  <br> not being able to watch stuff just fine <br>Having seen almost no anime must feel bad.</br></br>  <br>Fuck you Funi. They always do this every season.<br><br><br>I will try and watch it, unless I have stuff to do.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yet they released Game of Laplace on time and they did it by announcing it the very day it aired. In fact, every time they announced a simulcast release they did it on the same they it was released. So I wouldn't count out Akagami from being released today just yet.</br>  <br>I try to avoid stuff that only consists of the usual boring phrases that are repeated endlessly in 90% of the shows. I usually don't even watch stuff that's still airing but this show has picked my interest.</br>  <br>Thanks for your normalfag anime blog. Where do I subscribe?</br>  <br>Do you do anything besides shitposting ?</br>  <br> s-shitposting <br>  ? <br>You should go back to reddit, friend.</br></br></br>  <br>So you don't.</br>  <br>Maybe it depends on distributor, i hope we gets Shirayuki-hime fast too because it is Warner Bro.</br>  <br>huh. since when was shirayukihime any good? i only read it when it first came out. it didn't make that much of an impression.</br>  This is nothing like Yona; this is laidback, slice-of-life-ish and mostly boring and there is no sense of urgency or progression.  What's the point comparing Yona and Akagami?<br>Both of those are  fun   in a different way.  At the very least it's not the usual shoujoshit. Still a snore-fest sometimes though. </br>  <br> slice-of-life-ish and mostly boring and there is no sense of urgency or progression. <br>I have to disagree with you, they just don't make drama out of that and the manga is actually pretty funny too</br></br>  Which is better, this or Yona?  <br>I like this better</br>  While I get why people are comparing this to Yona, it's more like Horimiya romance and pace-wise than Yona, in my opinion. <br><br>The fantasy and political background is of the same vein as Yona but the way the story is told is more slice-of-lifey, non-dramatic like Horimiya. <br><br>Yona's a tad more dramatic than Akagami. It's both good and bad. People might say it's boring because there's really no drama when it comes to Shirayuki and Zen's relationship. There's no third party trying to interfere (Obi's in love with both Shirayuki and Zen and has no intentions of ever breaking them up), Izana's on the Zen x Shirayuki wagon after quibbling a bit and that's only because he wanted Zen to be absolutely sure Shirayuki's who he wanted, Kiki and Mitsuhide have a lovely side romance going on.<br><br>Honestly, it's just a really comfy slice-of-life of royalty with a splash of political and medical/pharmaceutical issues. <br><br>Plus, I'm a sucker for big brothers who dote on their little brothers. Izana and Zen are good siblings to each other.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the low-key drama makes dramatic moments stand out that much more - the MC isn't constantly having to deal with attacks on her life, so the one time she gets a warning crossbow shot (with helpful description attached), it's more of a big deal.</br>  <br>Got any proof?</br>  First episode in 1 hour<br><br>neetball will stream it</br></br>  <br>What about Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii, could it be compared to that?</br>    <br>I guess it's just an assumption that Funi simulcast will be delayed like some of their series and Funi still hasn't announced the schedule for this.</br>  <br> Mentioning Fushigi Yuugi at all </br>  <br><br>Fuck is the main guy the "I always fight with my sword's scabbard on cuz I'm that good hurr" guy?</br></br>  <br>Definitely. Probably even more than Horimiya, considering the setting. The MCs in Akagami are probably just a little less dramatic than Soredemo. Really, Zen and Shirayuki are probably one of the most drama-free couples I've come across. I don't know about the future but up to the most current chapter, they've never even had a disagreement that's threatened to break them up. I tend to like my romance drama free so it's probably why I rate them high (along with Horimiya's MCs).<br><br>Story-wise, both Soredemo and Akagami deal with royalty. Soredemo's probably more political, what with the main lead the actual king of a country while Zen's just the king's younger brother.<br><br><br>Shirayuki deals with the attempts on her life nmuch better than I would. But then, she's a lot calmer than me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't like  that midget. </br>  <br>When Zen fights for real, there's no scabbard. It's not that kind of series where he shows off his sword skills. He's a prince. Everyone expects him to be that good. He HAS to be that good or his brother would confine him to the castle at all costs.</br>  <br>I think it's more "I only draw my sword against equals, not commoners like you". Snobbery based on status, not skills.</br>  <br>they are not tsunderes</br>  <br>Not really. He kills random pirates, presumably. It's not like he fights people all that often, though.</br>  In honor of the first episode, who are your five favorite characters?<br><br>1. Izana<br>2. Zen<br>3. Shirayuki<br>4. Kiki/Mitsuhide<br>5. Obi/ Ryuu (the pharmacy guy)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you sure about that? It's still offline.</br>  <br>It's tough, since I ended up surprisingly charmed by all of them in the end.

The paranoia is real.<br><br>Anyway, I still can't believe Ryuu makes it to your top 5 over Mitsuhide.</br></br></br>  <br>Why don't you make a top 10 shoujo series recommendation list for the good children on /a/ next?

He wouldn't even have noticed you were making a ranking list that way. Hell, he's probably done it before himself.</br>  Both Yona and Akagami are boring. Pic related IS the shit.  neetball still offline?<br><br>It starts soon in 4 minutes</br></br>  <br>I really like the Yona manga. It's not quite 12 Kingdoms Level, but it definitely shocked me when I expected it to be some fantasy shoujo and next thing I know people are getting decapitated and shit.</br>  <br>I think you're right but it's pretty amazing how retarded a numerical list makes people stupid.</br>  <br>Basara was really good but the dumb Red King's identity stuff was drawn out pointlessly.</br>  <br>Oh hey, thanks for the rec.</br>  <br>Well shit, thanks for reminding me that I still have to remove that one from my backlog.</br>  <br>I like all the fantasy shoujo mentioned in this thread. Now what?</br>  Any good list of readable fantasy shoujo stuff?  <br>U se brute force called google. </br>  It is on douyu  <br>All these years later and I still prefer From Far Away or even Red River/Anatolia Story to Basara.</br>  <br>Oh look, it's that one idiot prince.</br>  <br> link? </br>  Basara: very good<br>Red River: decent, the final arc is fucking awful<br>Meteor Methuselah: decent, fairly shounen-ish<br>Kanata Kara: Inu-Yasha done right, good art</br></br></br>  <br>Just search the archive.

It didn't seem low budget at all.</br>  <br>Maybe they couldn't handle doing it all at once? BONES has a shitton of shows coming up, including the ever delayed Kekkai Sensen ending.</br>  <br>Oh so they did get it out on time</br>  <br> The song sounds like it's more suited for the ending rather than the opening though. <br>There will never be a "wait why is this the OP and that the ED" case as big as Sora no Woto's</br></br>  <br>Except it very clearly is, movement is so freaking slow, choppy, and generally not fluid. it doesnt even look like a bones show especially compared to the stuff they were doing in kekkai.

Just watched it.<br><br>It's shit.</br></br>  <br>Profound.</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  Manga is the greatest love story ever told, can't wait for this to be shit.  <br>I love 12 kingdoms and Yona. Saiunkoku was a snorefest. I tried hard to like it.</br>  So, did Bones fuck it up?  <br>No, it's great.</br>  <br>Thats what people were telling about Chaika at first..</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=uwJ<wbr>9QWtKB7o</wbr>  [ ]  <br>It might surprise you but I can't see the future so it's possible Bones could screw up again. Right now, they haven't.</br>  <br>It was pretty good actually. A very straightforward adaptation with some minor tweaks here and there, mostly to give Shirayuki a bit more screen time and to set the mood. The animation was pretty standard fare with a few really nice moments like Zen bursting into Raji's room.<br><br>Not mind-blowing or anything but better than expected, and definitely worth watching if you're into the manga.</br></br></br>  I hope we get a lot of fanart about the MC preparing medicines.  https://d.maxfile.ro/gdweumbikw.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  It was alright, Felt like I was watching a Disney film though.<br><br>The visuals seem really high quality with the classical music.<br><br>Will watch for Saori.</br></br></br></br>   Already read the mango 2 times <br>Damn, I lost all the motivation to watch this</br>  The episode + ED would have been an amazing single episode OVA.  <br>Wasn't this is pretty much intended as a one-shot until the publisher decided to extend it?</br>  <br>Literally what is the point of these webms</br>  <br>I read it on /a/ but I don't know if it's true.</br>  Shirayuki's VA is perfect. It's exactly how I imagined she would sound like holy shit.  Characters dont look quite in manga, so no sense of instant familiarity appears that one would`ve like.<br><br>But i have to admit, it barely matters, since Bones surprisingly did great job and the show looks great and good on itself, way over the meager expectations i had (hopefully the quality continues past episode one).<br><br>I have to say its not Shirayuki, Zen etc. i know - but i am glad to learn them anew and sure will enjoy the show and continue to enjoy manga. <br><br>Anime is entirely own product, even if it cant transmit some thing of the manga beuty - it adds a lot of its own.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I keep on hearing Shinoa from Owari, I'll have to get used to the lack of smug.</br>  Normally don't care for shoujo or romance but this thread has convinced me to try it, how political and dramatic does this get, I can't really tell from reading the thread.  <br>The Disney like setting helped get over the smug image quickly</br>  <br>What? The characters are just like their manga counterparts.</br>  <br>I felt like sawashiro would've been a good fit, but this isn't too bad either.</br>  <br> How political <br>Not too political since the main problem is that the dude is a prince and the girl is just a doctor. <br><br> How dramatic <br>Thankfully not that much since the prince has common sense to clear up and misunderstanding same goes for the girl who also has common sense<br><br>All in all it's a comfy love story</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> All in all it's a comfy love story <br>Did you even read past first chapters?<br><br>What you posted is nonsense.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sawashiro should have voiced Kiki.</br>  <br>I read up to the latest. It's pretty fucking comfy despite the kidnapping and other shit that happened.</br>   shameless fanservice <br>dropped</br>  I cant wait for the  early as fuck kiss  to be animated  <br>And to add to that, Zen was pretty fucking based when he saved Shirayuki from the pirates</br>   character development in the first 5 minutes <br><br>DROPPED<br>R<br>O<br>P<br>P<br>E<br>D</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>eh, kiki's as deadpan as it gets, to the point I couldn't even think of a suitable seiyuu for her.</br>  <br>What? I don't remember the kiss being early as fuck. More like wait till the second half if you want to see them kiss.</br>  Well that felt a lot like an OVA  <br>Considering shoujo manga (atleast the ones I read) it's pretty early.</br>  Raj is best girl. I hope anime only fags will not hate him and wait for him to get good.  This heroine is ridiculously proactive.<br> prince's concubine? <br> nah fuck that shit, let me pack up my things and skedaddle out of here <br> this guy doesn't believe that I want to patch him up? <br> here faggot I hit and healed myself, am I trustworthy enough yet <br> slaps the prince <br>This girl has more balls than most male leads.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Mitsuhide looks weird for some reason  Do you think we'll get an anime original ending? <br><br>This manga feels like it's going to go on forever, and it's monthly too which is killing me.<br><br><br><br>That's how a lot of manga get serialized so it could easily be the case.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh boy you're in for a ride, she is pretty freaking badass in her own right.</br>  <br>Think on the upside, it's monthly. It used to be bi-monthly.</br>  <br>That's her character She's hardworking and proves all those that doubt her position wrong. She's really cool, this archetype is always the best. <br><br><br>I dropped the manga because I couldn't stand the wait. It's why I want a really nice conclusive ending they can retcon if they need to make new seasons  which is unlikely </br></br></br></br>  By the way, is this normal medieval or will there be fantasy elements? Are there non-human races or magic or is this a simple, no-bullshit setting?  This woman knows her place.  <br> if they need to make new seasons <br> Yona had the yellow dragon in the OP/ED from the very beginning <br> he only joins in the very last episode <br>I felt cheated.</br></br></br></br>  That orchestral OST makes it feel like an old Disney movie.  <br>Normal medieval with Alchemy (and other scientific magic scholars study)</br>  Are we getting anything aside from Funishit?  <br>There'll be  glowing flower related incident. <br>Is it count as normal?</br></br>  Shirayuki a cute  <br> Alchemy <br>Don't you mean PHARMACY?</br></br>  <br> Same shit. At the very least let me think that way, I want my atelier related anime. </br>  Are they getting American money from Disney or is this just ridiculously high Budget  <br>But it already exists.  Arland anime when? </br>   palace illuminated at night with magic light <br>fuck you, Bones! Dropped!<br><br>Shirayuki and co are still in process of inventing the lights. And even if were inventeed, surely the spare stock they have woudnt be used for Disneyland illumination until they have industrial production of it.<br><br>There is no "magic electric light" in Shiroyuki world, thats kind one of important plot points since they are trying to create one.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alchemy was them trying to turn shit into fucking gold but ended up creating science. <br>Pharmacy was not the official name back then but Herbalism was.</br></br>  <br>Not enough.  I want Iris adaptation. I think I have shit taste. </br>   Character development in the first episode <br><br>FUCKING DROPPED</br></br>  Blue haired boy is best boy   /a/ watching shoujo <br>I want tumblr to leave.</br>  <br> inb4 anime original ending <br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHA  ;_; </br></br>  <br> There is no "magic electric light" in Shiroyuki world, thats kind one of important plot points since they are trying to create one. <br>Anime original confirmed?</br></br>  <br>Aside Commie, I think all existing fansub groups have already announced their plan for this season so I don't know if they are going to add this series to their plan.<br><br> mfw almost all series which are simulcasted by Funimation this season aren't picked up by any sub groups. </br></br></br>  <br>Weak bait.</br>  <br>But /a/ wants you to leave<br><br><br>Atleast we'll get to see the kiss animated</br></br></br></br>  <br>More likely Bones not paying attention/research while making this ED. Persons drawing it probably did not even read the manga.<br><br>Or you can pretend this shot is from future, where they successfully perfected light stones and now they are used everywhere like light bulbs.</br></br></br>  <br>ebin</br>  <br>Yeah it happens relatively early. <br><br>Do you think the second cour might by completely anime original?<br><br> I don't actually remember anything that happens after the kiss. </br></br></br></br></br>  That works too but I feel it's rather unpopular to get it's own adaption.  <br>Technically the official name for herbalism today is pharmacognosy more than pharmacy in general.</br>  <br>meant for <br/></br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>Huh? Isn't that just fire, they're not cavemen</br>  For attelier fans, the only interesting ark is Royal Pharmacist exams - since it`ll have lots of alchemy and "herbalism".<br><br>She`ll gather stuff and produce and research medicaments in most other arks as well, but only this ark looks like straight from Attelier game.</br></br>  <br>If I remember correctly it's the trip back to her home town and then she gets kidnapped. It's a pretty long arc so i'll doubt it will be animated. How many episodes for this one again?</br>  <br>This whole episode felt like a shameless fanfiction written by El Elf.</br>  First episode was pretty great. I was afraid that I might not like the animation bc I am so used to the manga's art but surprisingly it was easy in the eyes.<br><br>The seiyuu cast is spot on though when I first heard Shirayuki's voice I was thinking of Shinoa.<br><br>Also,<br> that adorable ryuu studying <br>my heart.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The current ark of the manga is about Shiroyuki and co researching a light source by using a rare plant they encountered before and the crystals. <br><br>They dont have effective means of long illumination in their world - no gas lamps, no electricity. Most illumination is torches and candles.<br><br>On screen you obviously see artifical spectrum light from crystal like things (pretty much what they try to do). Especially the small round lights on the walls between windows cant be torches or anything else.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, it's pretty much impossible, but hey, man can dream, right?</br></br>   Why do I find Zen so attractive   <br> /a/ watching magical girl show <br> /a/ watching childrens card game <br> /a/ watching idol show <br> /a/ watching boku no pico <br><br>welcome to /a/. if we were tumbler we would be arguing over something stupid like how there isn't enough transgender black people in Naruto</br></br></br></br></br></br>  This show looks great. Now i really want to see pic related adapted.  <br>Because he is handsome. No homo</br>  <br>Split 2 cour, so 26. <br><br><br>Make me some medicine Shirayuki</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Well she is voiced by Hayami Saori so I kind of figured.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think I want to see that adapted. I like that manga design, and I'm not sure which studio can do that justice.  And I don't want to see that thing get shitposted with &gt;hurr durr so edgy bullshit. </br>  Trying to decide if I want to pick this up, never read the manga. Is it anything like soredemo sekai?  Not gonna bother with this, I don't really read shoujo stuff and the anime is probably worse than the manga  <br>Thank you for your insightful opinion no one cares about.</br>  <br/>  <br> I don't like shoujo so I'll post in this thread to let fellow anon knows. <br>That anon probably just tsundere.<br> And well, you care enough to reply. </br></br></br>  <br>Animes like this are obvious and you can understand what is happening while watching it 10 times faster, I suppose.</br>  I want to impregnate Kiki.  Just finished watching the ep, havnt read the manga at all and went in pretty blind, seems interesting enough to keep me entertained for 20 minutes a week. What should I expect from the upcoming eps??  Holy shit this scene. Made me crack up just like the manga.<br>Also why the fuck does this first episode look so good, it looked really bad from the key visuals, but it actually looks fine now.<br><br><br> animes </br></br></br></br>  <br>But she wants to be impregnated by Mitsuhide</br>  <br>But you are not Mitsuhide anon.</br>  <br>Honestly I really don't know any Studio that could adapt The Ancient Magus Bride. They would have to get the setting and atmosphere right. Maybe Bones or Mappa?</br>  <br> mangareader </br>  I hope this feels the emptiness I am left with after Tender Rain ended.  How can she be so kind to a guy who violently beats her on a regular basis?  He stopped beating her years ago after she stopped resisting.  <br>She has a big heart.</br>  <br><br>that's anime-orinal content, which is contradictory to the actual story.<br><br>The only reason she would have visited him instead of moving into the Emiya house is oujii-san's orders.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then why does she still get bruises?</br>  She's a nice girl for you  Would Sakura a Taiga?    <br>He just loses control sometimes, it's not his fault. If Sakura were a better girl, like her sister, this wouldn't happen.</br>  She was raped, wasn't she?  <br>Maybe she falls down the stairs a lot.</br>  <br>She was educated.</br>  <br>While anime only, I don't think it is contradictory. Sakura keeps all her shit on the inside and without the grail influence, she is going to go out of the way to be kind even though she shouldn't.</br>  <br>Frequently.</br>  <br>Routinely by her brother, and maybe once by Zouken? Can't remember.<br><br>But it wasn't incest because she's actually from the Tohsaka family, and thus not blood related to Shinji and Zouken.</br></br></br>  She enjoys being raped by Shinji. She's nursing him back to health so she can get the dick sooner, especially now that she has zero chance with Shirou.    <br>Y'know I wonder if Shinji would have had anything to do with getting that new heir from Sakura that Zouken wants, or if he would have just done it himself.</br>  <br> she's actually from the Tohsaka family, and thus not blood related to Shinji and Zouken. <br>Funny thing about that, Zouken's worms fucked her up so bad she's not only a Matou in name, she's a Matou all the way down on the genetic level. He made her blood related.</br></br>  <br> she's a Matou all the way down on the genetic level. He made her blood related. <br>Next level adoption.</br></br>  <br> Zouken's worms fucked her so bad she's not only a Matou in name, she's a Matou all the way down on the genetic level. <br>bretty hot tbh</br></br>  <br> that's anime-orinal content <br><br>Not really.</br></br></br>  <br>Damn, they literally fucked those Tohsaka out of her, and filled her up with Matou.<br>That's pretty crazy.</br></br>  <br>Worms are truly amazing</br>  <br>I can't wait for the rape scene to be animated.</br>  <br> violently beats her on a regular basis? <br>Nice headcanon.</br></br>  <br> I don't care what Sakura, as long as she grows up to be a great magus the Tohsaka bloodline's chances of reaching the Root are doubled. <br>It shouldn't be possible for Tokiomi to lose so badly with this kind of sentiment. He wanted her to grow up to be a powerful magus, but instead Zouken crippled her and neglected her education. He wanted her to participate in the Heaven's Feel, but some blue-haired fucktard muggle participated in her place. And he wanted the Tohsaka bloodline to continue into the future, but Zouken fucked that up so completely she's not even recognizable as a Tohsaka in any way. Literally everything went to shit.<br><br>Zouken's trolling is next level.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want a "it's worms, I ain't gotta explain shit" pic now.</br>  <br>But they are explained, just read the NV.</br>   Sakurafags <br>Read this. It's about your waifu.</br>   This thread   <br>That's what he gets for selling his daughter.</br>  <br>Because there's a command seal forming on her hand, moron</br>  <br>Yes, they explained... with worms.</br>    <br>Now topple this on the fact that Rin drops out of The Clocktower to go fuck and run around with a mage with no crest.</br>  This raisin may possibly be the fucking greatest dried fruit in any anime I've ever seen.<br><br> Based <br> Has a hot son <br> Has a hot granddaughter <br> Fucks them both <br> Doesn't give a fuck about haters <br> Fuck your ethics <br> Fertilize worms <br> Fuck you <br><br>Matou Zouken: Genuinely Dehydrated</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So what you're saying is that Tokiomi's favorite end is HF?<br> Matous and Emiyas out of the game <br> Sakura dewormed and taking care of the city <br> Rin marrying an old man </br></br></br></br>    <br>Opinion: Zouken has more charisma than Kirei. I couldn't help but have a smile on my face whenever he appeared on HF, despite knowing what he had done, he's so... collected, yet threatening, it's just great.<br><br>Also, Hassan is a bro.</br></br></br>  <br> no Grail <br> no Root <br> Sakura still a Matou by blood <br>What's the point?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Who needs the grail when Rin has Zelretch?</br>  <br>Thaumaturgically Enriched</br>  <br>Based Zouken knows how to pick top tier servants.</br>  <br> rape scene to be animated <br>anon</br></br>  <br> Medusa <br> Top tier </br></br>  <br> being a secondary </br>  Thanks Heart !!+La1BFno7xw for working on Heaven's Feel.  <br>Medusa's actually pretty ballin' in theory, she just never gets a chance to show it off. Gets screwed worse than almost any other Servant in that regard.</br>  <br><br>Except that Tokiomi knew exactly what would happen to her and didn't give a fuck, because like all mages, he only cares about the Root and considers other people, even his own children, as mere stepping stones. He is actually much worse than Zouken, who was corrupted while trying to live out good intentions. Why do you think he is Gil's master? All master's have some personality connection with their servants, and his connection was being a completely evil person like Gil. <br><br>Even Kotomine is a better person than him---he may have been born with an impulse for evil, but he hates himself for it and feels guilty about it. Tokiomi just doesn't give a fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirou has Rin's crest, jeez did you watch the anime with your eyes closed you fucking moron?</br>  Can anyone beat a serious Sir Lancelot?  <br>Meh. Hassan is the only one I sort of like, though he really doesn't do or say much if all the VN is taken into account. Berserkalot had some hilarious scenes, but he was kinda boring after his dogfight. Medusa was wallpaper throughout most of FSN and I really didn't care for her even in HF.</br>  Anyone have the shot from the VN where Shirou asks Zouken if he did anything to Sakura and he answer "Of course not".  Surely Tohsaka must have thought, "GEE, WHO DO I GIVE MY OTHER DAUGHTER TO, SOME CREEPY OLD GUY THAT APPARENTLY LIVES FOR WAY LONGER THAN A NORMAL HUMAN DOES, OR TO SOME MINOR MAGUS FAMILY HEIR FOR A WIFE?"<br>The question is what the fuck made him give Sakura to the former.</br>  <br>Ramses II and Pestilence off the top of my head.</br>  <br>Rider Nero gg</br>  <br>How can you tell whether he's serious when all he says is "rrrarararaarggggrahragrgahr" and "aaaaarrrrrthuuuurrrrr"</br>  <br>Ba dum, tssss<br> That was the joke </br></br>  <br> Except that Tokiomi knew exactly what would happen to her and didn't give a fuck <br>He didn't know exactly what would happen. He may very possibly have known that Matou magecraft involved parasites, but he would likely not know about the details of it. He would almost certainly have known that whatever those bugs were for could not be pleasant, and he had accepted that on Sakura's behalf, but exactly what unpleasantness would at most have been left vague to him.<br><br> Why do you think he is Gil's master? <br>Because he used a catalyst specifically for summoning Gil.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did they have to be penis shaped?</br>  <br>She was trying to keep the peace so she could still go to Shirou's house/keep Shirou in the dark about her life. If you read the VN, you see that once she disobeys, she's fucked.</br>  <br>Yes, cute dicks &gt; ugly rhinos.</br>  <br>The artist fought for penis shaped worms. Later in the manga, when Kariya foughts Tokiomi, all the wasps are dick shaped too.</br>  <br> SOME CREEPY OLD GUY THAT APPARENTLY LIVES FOR WAY LONGER THAN A NORMAL HUMAN DOES <br>Magi exceeding the natural human life expectancy is not at all uncommon in the Nasuverse, though. What should have ticked him off is that everyone who knows about Zouken knows he's ridiculously evil even by magi standards.</br></br>  <br>Reminder that in UBW, Shinji wins the Sakurabowl once he's straightened out and acts like the good brother she used to know.</br>  <br>Let's raise the stakes.</br>    <br>Of course.</br>  <br>He seems so hillariously evil that I first thought he was going to be a good guy in the VN</br>  <br>They're going inside her cooch, if you think about it'd be even worse if they weren't penis shaped.</br>  <br> Implying he wasn't a good guy. <br>he dindu nuffin he a gud worm he was gon create utopia</br></br>  <br>like all the sad sacks you fight in das, artorias was a lot weaker than he used to be</br>  Maybe Shinji's awful personality was cured by Gay Bulge, the meat Grail, and most importantly Tohsaka's display of mercy.<br><br>Shit can change a man. That said, that takes a lot of character on Sakura's part. Maybe they'll both grow to love each other again. <br><br> Or maybe not. Shinji's probably still mad about being a squib. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't the artist Takuchi? What the fuck is up with this dude? He bowed to cutting IIya raping Shirou's headless corpse while IIya made Shirou watch the act by keeping his head alive yet fought for dickworms? Is he the reason Sakura and Rider have such sexy bodies as well?</br>  <br>The manga artist is another guy.</br>  <br>you forgot the part were he got lectured by his waifu before dying like a bitch.</br>  <br> Riders are supposed to have stronger NPs with slightly reduced stats <br> Riders so far got rekt by NPs of Archer and Saber <br><br>I'm not even going to mention getting her head punched off by a homeroom teacher.</br></br></br></br>  So I remember this line of Zouken where he talks about tempering Sakura's body, or something. <br><br>Was he talking about worms, or he also actually raped Sakura?</br></br>  <br>The only boner he has is for suffering and the grail, the only person to stick their dick in her til ejaculation is Shinji and he did it because he wants to control something about Sakura, to make himself believe he's above her in some way. Sakura's pity to him just made him worse.</br>  <br>Pretty sure he was talking about fusing whatever remained of Irisviel into Sakura</br>  <br><br>&lt;3</br></br>  <br>There practically isn't even a difference between those two things</br>  <br>If Shinji really cared that much about magic shit he would do the smart thing and form a good family with Sakura, since her womb is pretty much guaranteed to breed mages. But isntead he's just an asshole.</br>  alright /a/ i got a question. i recently got into this series by watching UBW, and i know there was a good season of this a couple of years ago. but i also heard that many of the other seasons were shit. so what other seasons should i watch?  <br>Read the VN</br>  <br>Fate/stay night [Unlimited Blade Works]<br>Fate/Zero<br><br>If you're interested in the games and novels, check those out too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>For you</br>  <br>Epically meme'ed</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127658702 <br>Heath Ledger, Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson were the only good parts of those movies</br>  <br>You can watch Fate/Zero, but it will probably spoil some plot points of HF, which has yet to come out. You could also watch Kara no Kyokai, which is by the same studio and adapted from the same authors (you'll notice the similarities pretty quick).<br><br>Avoid the old FSN and UBW movie by DEEN.</br></br></br>  <br> Implying Hardy's Bane isn't perfect (until the end of TDKR). <br>Memes and voice aside Bane was spot on, the guy trolled the shit out of everything and was constantly in control during the whole movie.</br></br>  <br>Watch Deen</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127658702 <br>I request a DEEN Batman</br>  <br>Riders tend to have more NPs, not stronger NPs.</br>  <br>http://www.businessinsider.com/chri<wbr>stopher-nolan-reveals-most-proud-of<wbr>-the-dark-knight-rises-opening-scen<wbr>e-2015-4</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127658702 <br>Shirou did I ever tell you about the time your father made a man paraplegic, cut his wife's arm off, then shot them dead while they were completely defenseless?

He's best boy.</br>  How was Kojiro even a challenge for Saber? If he's totally fictional, then that means that the probably fictional encounter with Musashi is how he actually died. <br><br>He got killed with a fucking boat oar.</br></br>  <br><br> How was Kojiro even a challenge for Saber?  <br><br>He was a pretty hardcore farmer, don't overestimate autism.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because he's literally so skilled he can replicate sorcery with his fucking sword.</br>  <br>He wasn't, Did you miss how easily Saber cut him down when she stopped holding back?</br>  <br> secondaries </br>  <br>Read the VN.</br>  <br>Anon, she only won because she had partially seen his technique before. He was out of mana and fading away and she barely survived, with all the advantages stacked in her favor.</br>  What's up with ufotable and their visual throwbacks?  <br>Don't forget she only managed to dodge that last Tsubame Gaeshi because his sword got bent.</br>  Pic related, Tsubame Gaeshi.  <br> those fucking birds <br>This was made by the renowned Sengoku era artist, DEEN-san.</br></br>  <br>So Ufotable fucked up?</br>  <br>don't forget the rape</br>  <br>They fucked up in episode 7 yeah, when he used his full Tsubame Gaeshi and Saber didn't die on the spot.</br>  <br>They shoulda put in the fact that his nodachi was fucked up. It would have been cool if he was still holding his ground even after his sword was folded a million +1 times.</br>  <br>Is there a Knight that can EVEN TOUCH Sir Gawain? Let alone defeat him?<br><br>I'm not talking about the pussy French Gawain. I'm not talking about the awesome English Gawain either. Heck, I'm not even talking about Gawain as Arthur's best Rider Gwalchmei.<br>I'm talking about English Numeral of the Saint Gawain with Excalibur, Galatine, Excalibur Galatine, Rhongowennan, Fail-Not, casting spells when Merlin isn't around, the Shield of Judas Maccabee, the sword that refused to kill Gawain for being the best knight in the world while Gawain is the hero of the Grail Quest &amp; therefore has the Holy Grail, the Bleeding Spear?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do you meme old posts?</br>  <br>But she did die, she just released her zanny to make sure she didn't die for good.</br>  <br>Well shit, if Caster had summoned Musashi it wouldn't be much of a story.

I thought about including a "while borrowing" &amp; including every weapon from Arthurian mythology but that'd take too long.</br>  <br>Memelicious!</br>  <br>Do you feel in charge?</br>  Why don't people want to protect Sakura?<br><br>I want to protect her.</br></br>  <br>She's the reason there is no Ilya route.</br>  <br>HF is the Ilya route, Ilya has the most relevance and presence.<br><br>Sakura is just the love interest.</br></br></br>  <br>HF True:<br> Rin has pseudo Second Magic and is the pupil of the founder of the Clock Tower <br> Sakura has pseudo Third Magic, gets all the assets of the Matou and a full powered Servant, administrating Fuyuki in Rin's absence. <br><br>Maybe Rin won't marry an old man, but Flat who is idiotic but he's a prodigy with crest.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The crest no longer works as crest, it's been destroyed, and only works as a link to pass prana.<br><br>Read RN.</br></br></br>  <br>I do too, it's just that I want to protect Illya more</br>    Why is Kiritsugu treated as a heartless person, even though his methods are chosen only because he's much weaker than everyone else in the HGW?<br><br>Kiritsugu is a normal person with minimum magic that just allows him to move a bit faster.<br><br>Saber, Lancer, Kayneth etc. have the luxury to act all high and mighty because they are powerful, they can win without resorting to under-handed tactics. They have powerful skills that allow them to 1v1 duel.<br>For Kerry, the only way he can win is through 'dishonorable' tactics.<br><br>This is a big flaw in Saber's reasoning in F/Z that is overlooked.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Because he used a catalyst specifically for summoning Gil. <br><br>I'm talking about from a narrative perspective. All the masters and servants have some personality connection.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> implying I don't </br></br>  <br>That shit he did to Kayneth was pretty fucked up. And did she ever hear about his past work? Because Kiritsugu doesn't seem like the kind of guy to try and dispel the rumors about him, like how he just blew up a full airliner with a SAM to kill one dude.</br>  <br>Everyone in the plane was already dead by bees.</br>  <br>The only underhanded thing he used in Zero was the thing with Kayneth. It was basically blackmail.</br>  <br>Yeah, but the rest of the world didn't know that, and its not like he'd be the one to correct them. I think Kerei even didn't know, and used that to taunt Shirou at one point.</br>  <br>She is though.</br>  I'd like to take the time to discuss something I've always been a little bit fuzzy about. In the VN, at some point during all of the extra exposition about how the Grail system works and Servants, Heroic Spirits, Throne of Heroes etc. All that stuff that didn't make it into the adaption. So yeah, wasn't it mentioned that the Servants that get summoned (other than Saber who is a special case) are just copies of the Heroic Spirit and their experiences in the Grail War don't actually become a part of the original that is stored in the Throne of Heroes? Now obviously Counter-Guardians keep their memories when they get sent out for cleanup duty, otherwise Archer wouldn't have those memories. My true question is, I've always been under the impression that part of what makes the UBW ending bittersweet is that the Servant EMIYA's experience of being put at ease by meeting his younger, idealistic self will simply disappear and the actual Heroic Spirit EMIYA would continue on with his eternal hell, despite what he says to Rin as he disappears. Is that correct or has there been something I overlooked?  <br>The route where she got beat up and raped was in Heaven's Feel. She experienced no such thing in Fate and UBW.</br>  <br>Kelly is probably like the second least worse of the masters in Zero. Tokiomi gave her daughter to a monster, Ryunosuke and Kirei are literal psychopaths, Kayneth is a complete retard, and Kariya... well, he had good intentions, but not for good reasons, and unlike Kiritsugu we're shown no good reason as to why he's chasing his idealistic dream. The only one that's better than Kelly is based Weiba.</br>  <br>You're totally right. <br><br>They made that shit up as they went along.</br></br></br>  <br>The VN mentions his memories would get erased. The anime completely removed any mention of that.<br><br>Probably my favorite retcon of the adaptation.</br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't Rin saying to Archer that he will never be saved imply that he will forget?</br>  <br> forgetting Cillian Murphy </br>  <br>You could interpret that that way, but you also have to remember she wanted to form a contract with him.<br><br>The anime though didn't mention a single thing about memories.</br></br></br>  <br>Him too.</br>  <br> Kariya... well, he had good intentions, but not for good reasons, <br><br>He did , but he honestly is a fragile person with a big ego, like all Matou's he flat out refused to face himself and what he was until it was too late, he basically just drowned in his own delusions right up to his death. Aoi was right, he never loved anyone but himself.</br></br></br>  <br>Of course he was:<br><br> fought Manus previously while protecting an injured Sif <br> broke his left arm (he's left handed)  <br> left his ring and shield that protects him from the abyss to Sif <br> he fought you wielding his sword on his right arm <br> with his left arm just swinging around broken and useless <br> his armor is all torn up and broken <br> the abyss eating away at his mind <br><br>But even though he's really weakened at this state, you still surpassed him because you did all of those thing, that he failed at.<br><br> you protected Sif (and killed him later in a moonlit duel) <br> you acquired his shield <br> you acquired the amulet <br> you permanently shattered the abyss and destroyed Manus <br> you destroyed the remnants of his influence, the four kings of new londo </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shinji is already protecting her anon.<br><br>With his dick.</br></br></br>  <br> <br> </br> </br>  <br>  . </br>  <br>I don't think he's doing it right</br>  <br> . . </br>  <br>why do those worms look like dicks?</br>  <br>Well, it is Shinji after all.</br>  <br>not on screen. she was raped in all the other scenarios off camera</br>  <br> farmer <br>Nigga Not Sasaki was a NEET ronin who played with his sword all day. That's probably why he was bound to Ryuudo Temple, because he never left there even when he was alive. Don't know why he fancied himself a ladies man, the only difference between him and the average /a/ poster is that Sasaki didn't eat as much.</br></br>  What is your unpopular Fate opinion?  <br>I like UBW's soundtrack.</br>  <br>Unpopular.</br>  <br>Archer acted like a stuck-up manchild in UBW.<br><br>I get it, your afterlife is hard, and so is seeing what an obnoxious chuuni your 16yo self was; but that doesn't give you the right to kill yourself and act like a fucking child.<br><br>No, I don't think he was GAR at all.</br></br></br></br></br>  why doesn't some moralfag mage eradicate mages like zouken who do all sorts of reprehensible shit? or why doesn't the church do it?<br><br>mages seem to be a group of fucking psychopaths who get a pass as long as they keep their shit semi-secret. and then they have nerve to cry about dead apostles.</br></br>  <br>That's not unpopular. UBW's soundtrack was good, better than Zero's at the very least. I can't remember a single track from Zero other than Sword of Promised Victory.</br>  <br>Shidou contracting with Alaya is the right choice.</br>  <br>He means Ufotable's.</br>  <br>Archer is mostly portrayed as a villain in UBW, and isn't really gar at all. I mean he's almost 100% an asshole in that route, and if you just straight up consider him a villain for that storyline, he works in that light I think.<br><br>He's more of a "cooler" guy in Fate and HF.</br></br></br>  <br> mages seem to be a group of fucking psychopaths who get a pass as long as they keep their shit semi-secret.  <br>This has been a thing for a while; they were already making fun of it in Discworld back in the 80s</br></br>  <br> Gil <br> completely evil <br><br>Gil is not bound the by morals of mongrels m8<br><br>being half-god lets you get around that kinda shit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Now all we need is Gilgamesh in Dark Souls.</br>  <br>I think Saber is one the best written characters in th VN despite thinking the Fate route is shit.</br>  <br>I know, and his snide, sarcastic personality is entertaining to watch in side material.<br><br>Hell, even the Archer in Shirou's daydream in Unlimited Budget Works is pretty based, it's just I don't get how secondaries were siding with Archer.</br></br></br>  http://rereadsandreviews.com/2015/0<wbr>7/05/ubw-review/</wbr>  <br>What?

Gil is pure evil.</br></br>  <br> original <br> manga <br>Fate, UBW, and HF may all be different stories and equally valid timelines, but they all start from the same base</br></br></br>  <br>Deep emotional trauma</br>  <br>The original Fate manga also removed Zouken entirely and changed what the Matou family was all about</br>  <br>There are multiple Fate manga, dude. I was just clarifying.<br><br>This manga here. It removed the worm stuff from Sakura's backstory.</br></br></br>  <br>What does it matter? The VN is what's canon.</br>  <br>There's a wonky Fate manga and a Heaven's Feel manga.</br>  <br>Every official adaptation is a canon universe somewhere. I'm just pointing out there actually is one storyline out there where all that stuff got snipped out.</br>  <br> shota-shit shirou right page <br> kenshin fist of the nortstar shirou left page <br> also all dat manface sader <br><br>what the fuck those aren't from the same manga are they</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wonder if anyone still has Gilgamesh vs Lancer from the manga?</br>  <br>They are. The manga is kind of fucking weird, and the art isn't great. It also started off being a little more UBW than Fate, but went right around back because Saber prints money.<br><br>What's funny is it lasted from DEEN's era all the way until Ufotable. Six years.</br></br></br>  <br>Are Sakura and Shirou a good couple?</br>  <br>Them getting together results in dozens if not hundreds of people dying and Shirou getting killed.</br>  <br><br>Because that's her fetish.</br></br>  <br>Why couldn't Sakura be happy with Shirou?</br>  <br> Zouken's worms fucked her up so bad she's not only a Matou in name, she's a Matou all the way down on the genetic level. He made her blood related. <br>Hot damn, people with no siblings and an incest fetish would pay so much for his services.  So long they don't mind the worms part. </br></br>  Someone tell me. Does EMIYA ever save sakura or is HF the only route shes not constantly raped.  <br>It's left in ambiguity and questions. We don't know.</br>  <br>The grail war system gets dismantled 10 years down the line, so in the very least, something's done about her within a decade.<br><br>Zouken though is pretty fucking senile. I mean his original plan was to have Sakura spy on Shirou, but he completely forgot about that unless you meet him early in HF. He might simply just go brain dead a little after the war.</br></br></br>  <br>But shes to breed better mages. They could just keep her in the rape dungeon.</br>  What event ultimately triggers HF and Fate? I know UBW is trigged when you use a command seal to stop Saber.  <br>Fate is triggered when you don't stop Saber. HF is caused by paying attention to Sakura early on.</br>  So, apparently my dad binged through Hibike! Euphonium a couple nights ago and he approached me with genuine interest in watching another anime series.<br><br>I don't know about you guys, but seeing my father showing actual excitement to experience more of the medium for the first time made me really happy.<br><br>So , naturally, I told him Oreimo was right up his alley!<br><br>He noticed F/SN on Crunchyroll after I left the TV on, and seeing as he had finished Game of Thrones recently, I suggested he try it. Just finished the Prologue with him (re-watch for me) and when Rin uses her magic to leap off the top of the school, he turns to me and says this:<br>"Whoa, this girl is the best."<br>So there you have it. My dad thinks Rin is best girl. How am I supposed to deal with his shit taste<br><br>But seriously, he loved it and is going to continue watching. Just felt like sharing, it's cool to see someone related to me this hyped about some good ol chinese cartoons.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  HF is caused by paying attention to Sakura early on. <br>so, in a sense falling for Sakura early on is a bad end where everything goes to shit.</br></br>  <br>Your dad has great taste.</br>  <br>Fate/stay night's prologue is pretty fantastic. I thought it was interesting how the manga shows us Sakura's point of view.</br>  <br> inane, Reddit-tier post <br>That poster in the pic got it right. Fuck off.</br></br>  <br> falling for <br>More like not being a shitty friend (or senpai for that matter)<br> Hey Sakura everything okay at home? You don't look alright. <br> Doushio! Everything's fine senpai ~ ! <br> No dude for real, you're covered in bruises. <br> Well my brother has been raping and abusing me but I don't want to let the family down and blah blah blah </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;/r/sakuramatou </br>   tfw you just found out Diarmud NTR'd your ancestor and namesake <br><br>Why even live</br></br>  <br> NTR'd by a bitch <br>Jesus anon, at least tell everyone your great^100 grandma was raped by CuChulainn or something.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm told Diarmud even killed his fucking cow. My family is full of shame.</br></br>  <br>she is a Christian.</br>  <br> he hates himself for  <br>fucking what? hes a complete sadist anon</br></br>  <br>my sidedishes</br>  <br> IIya raping Shirou's headless corpse while IIya made Shirou watch the act by keeping his head alive yet fought for dickworms? <br><br>holy fuck</br></br></br>  <br>If he liked GoT why don't you show him  Attack on Titan ?</br>  <br>Aoi was a fucking bitch and she deserved what she got.<br><br>Doesn't matter the reasons, at least he was the only one TRYING to do something. Her parents didn't give a fuck.<br>Sure he failed and he went crazy but at least he tried to help the little girl</br></br></br></br>  <br>He kinda did in HF. I loved the moment when they went like<br> do you have something to tell me, shounen? <br> no... <br>One minute later<br> hey, Kotomine, I actually have a problem... </br></br></br></br></br>      <br>m-muh ships</br>    <br><br>Saber's VA was hella moe during the UBW event at AX</br></br>  <br>Why do those worms look like dicks</br>    <br>Japan.</br>  <br>porn game.</br>  <br> my_little_anon_cannot_be_this_new.<wbr>jpg</wbr> </br>  <br>We got a badass oldfag over here guys!</br>  <br> most relevance and presence. <br>Ahahahahahahaha</br></br>  <br>He's right, though.</br>  I FUCKING. HATE. Heavens Feel so goddamn much. <br>Not because it's bad, it's probably the best of the three routes. <br>It just fucks up every other route so much for me. <br>Sakura has to be the kindest of the three girls, and she's definitely the only one that deserves to be a waifu of any kind, but her life is so shit that the best thing about it is that Shirou exists.<br>That is fucked. Especially when you know that the "personal business" she had that made her leave for a while in UBW was that she had to lie in a rape dungeon for the entirety of the grail way to fuel rider and Shinji. At least Rider dies fairly early on in UBW, but she was one of the primary villains in Fate. <br>And then what happens? in UBW's true end, Shirou and Tohsaka live happily ever after, but fuck Sakura, rape dungeon for ever.<br>I don't even know how HF ends, but on the flowchart I got, there's an option to "kill Sakura" or "save Sakura", so there better fucking not be any bullshit with this where "saving her IS killing her", because I think both she and I have suffered enough.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sakura's fine in the other routes. She even gets Shinji as her husbando in UBW.</br>  <br>She was never raped.</br>  <br><br>Shinji...I don't get why he gets all the hate on /a/. FSN is just written to make him out as the bad guy, when really he's no worse than any of the 'protagonists' and a better person than most of them.<br><br>What are the main complaints? He raped Sakura and stole Rider to use in the war?<br><br>Okay, let's get this straight. He never fucking raped Sakura. He never did it. He never did it. He never did it. He never did it. He fucked Sakura.<br><br>Let me ask you this. WHO IN THE GAME DIDN'T FUCK SAKURA? You can't even name one fucking character who hasn't plugged her loose cunt! She is the kind of bitch who will act like she doesn't want it when she really does. She'll say No! while having multiple orgasms. Shinji knew this, he's a fucking ladies man. He knows what filthy whores like Sakura want.<br><br>And there's this other big bitch you guys have with him. He supposedly stole Rider and used her in the war for his own greed.<br><br>Objection! He was worried about his one and only precious sister. Is keeping your loved ones from a brutal war so wrong? When Shirou does the same thing to Saber it's like 'oh he's so manly', but when Shinji does it it's wrong? He just wanted to protect Sakura. He probably was going to use his Holy Grail wish to tighten her cunt back up or cure her syphilis or something.<br><br>The story was written to make that faggot Shirou look good. Objectively, Shinji is a far better character than Shirou. At least he has the balls to take action decisively instead of dicking around like Shirou, and if he weren't stuck with the weak ass servant Rider and no plothax he probably would have won the war.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Typemoon used to be cool.</br>  <br> He probably was going to use his Holy Grail wish to tighten her cunt back up or cure her syphilis or something. <br><br><br>Is this true?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rider counters an Excaliblast from Saber Alter with a bit of Shirou support. She's just relegated to jobbing for the majority of the game.</br>  <br>Stockholm syndrome</br>  <br><br>There is nothing that says she was genetically changed. Her nature was attempted to be changed by Zouken to Water, but her Imaginary Element is only diminished, not gone. This was proven in Hollow.<br><br>The hair and eyes is just her being screwed over with magic. Zouken did pretty much go, "those Einzberns? Yeah I'll try to copy their grail techniques and throw whatever else I can into the mix, if she lives she lives, if she dies, I can get new material."<br><br>Tohsaka genes stronk. Why do you think she got such stonking great tits? European genes yo.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> the brother she used to know <br><br><br>You didn't see that scene in Hollow where she told the gang stories of when she and Shinji were kids did you? It was pretty bad.<br><br>He was always an awful onii-chan, and treated his imouto like a servant. He barely tolerated her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I just watched 24-25 back to back again.<br><br>Why was it so good, /a/?<br><br>Why is UBW so good?</br></br></br></br>    <br> use his Holy Grail wish to tighten her cunt back up or cure her syphilis or something <br>Gets me every fucking time.</br></br>  <br><br>It's funny because people don't realize this. It was even brought up in HF that he only tolerated Sakura because it made him feel superior, then hated her when he found out about the basement, which was pure idiocy on his part. <br><br>She felt badly for him because he was hilariously delusional to think the Matou family was a prestigious family anymore, and that the heir position even worth anything. Pity for someone hopelessly stupid and a spoiled brat, but who honestly tried to go for a dream.<br><br>That was the truth of the Matou siblings. Shinji doesn't even bother to apologize, the narrative goes "yeah, he is back to the way he used to be" without him having to do anything in the VN. Sakura was just decent enough to accept things and give him a chance to change. So it's not surprising she helps take care of him. The anime added that part about Sakura browbeating him into changing, but if he didn't learn anything from the experiences from the war, Sakura coaxing him to change seems a little much. Nasu should have at least had him apologize himself to make it less whitewashy.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "Miura, it is penultimate episode. What do we do? <br> "We will give Shirou 5 minute monologue out of nowhere that had no build up at all!" <br> "But viewers kind of don't give a shit about Shirou since he is a blank slate and people don't have any connection to him, so why?" <br> "Eh Shirou is stupid anyway and we need to fill episode with something before he does a shonen-y lightning filled hotblooded speech and does UBW." <br> "But won't that feel like asspull since we never explained how UBW works" <br> "Visual storytelling, yo~!" <br> "So that's like 70% of episode, what else?" <br> "let's add some anime original bullshit content of Grail Titan! Visual Storytelling Yo!" <br> "Since we are going full on visual experience will we faithfully animate the fight scene with Shirou swordraining against GOB?" <br> "Nah we will just have him deflect all swords by hand because lol why not" <br> "You are genius Miura!" <br><br><br>Well this was rushed as all hell. Again. <br>Holy shit, the pacing issues with this show are only overshadowed piss poor choreography and immature direction approach targetting teenagers(lightning, shouting, screaming, short attention span focus for various scenes, explosions, etc). <br><br>If I had to describe this episode in one word, it would be: anti-climatic. Another word? Hollow<br> Shirou's flashback was hollow and emotionless with no build up. <br> The Casting of UBW was anticlimatic and rushed(HOW do you make the casting of UBW look BORING?). <br> Cutting away to Saber by the grail was anticlimatic as all hell for SHirou fight. <br> Saber destroying the grail and fading away was anticlimatic, rushed and lacked the punch it should have had.  <br><br>That is the problem with the whole adaptation. They are just "covering" things as in a play, altering things for worse, rushing other things. No emotions, no tension, no visual cues or depth. Just things happening for no reason. Without context, without any sort complexity.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hate Shinjifags.</br>  <br>I hate anti-Shinjifags.</br>  <br> So Miura, ready to animate the end that gives closure to all the characters including Shinji?  <br> Nah let's just create 100% AO stuff while showcasing Rin's legs and adding fanservice! <br> B-b-ut what about the show's conclusion? <br> WHO CARES! WE'LL just wing it in half the time in a weird flashback sequence that makes no sense! <br> A-are you drunk again Miura?... <br><br>Did I miss an episode? <br>Did we miss an episode?<br>This feels like an episode is missing.<br>You know, the episode which covers the rest of the epilogue before this London Anime Original Stuff happens.<br>So, like, where is it? Oh right they just did a weird timeskip then flashback which was clearly beyond the director's capabilities to not make confusing. GG.<br><br>All that can be said about this episode is that this was pretty much 50% fanservice for VN Readers 50% moe buttshot crap. I will not be surprised if AO viewers will have shit-ton of problems with all those characters out of nowhere and weird tone shift. <br>This was a weird decision. <br><br>A year ago, around this time, we all were excited at possibility at Fate Stay Night being done right, showcasing the complexity, depth and maturity it deserves and has. <br>Those expectations were not met. What we got was a disjointed mess that did not know what it wanted to be - Zero sequel? VN faservice? Proper adaptation? anime original route? <br><br><br>The writing staff did not know. And thus UfoUBW was born from that impossibility to decide what to do or how to do.<br>Was the show's problem its scope? I doubt it.<br>Was the show's problem a subpar to mediocre writing and production staff assigned? Most likely. <br><br>The adaptation was hollow. All its depth, meaning, philosophical complexity, character depth, battle tactics, lore, etc - missing. No emotion in fights nor decisions. Just people rehashing a play. <br><br>Either way the show is finally over and can be forgotten. Time to mend misinterpretations and misinformation begins, as even more slander is thrown towards the franchise.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm glad this guy's 15 minutes are up.</br></br>  <br>I'm not anti-Shinjifag. It's alright for you to be one, I forgive you because I'm a Sakurafag and I have compassion.<br><br><br>You don't have to copy/paste your same post all the time.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm a Sakurafag and I have compassion <br>Let me guess, it was all Angry Manjew's fault, right?</br></br>  <br>It's only fair Heaven's Feel gets the same treatment of UBW = shit</br>  Armenian archer  <br>HF is seven kind of fucked unless it gets the KnK treatment. UBW made out like a bandit.</br>  I've been wondering, how would Nasu adapt an athlete into becoming a hero?<br>a great example would be Michael Jordan summoned as an Archer class.<br>How can you compare modern greatest to historical greatness?<br><br>Would a world class fencer summoned as saber be the greatest swordsmen?</br></br></br></br>  <br>We'd probably get heroic spirits based on fictional people like Arturia and Kojiro.</br>  <br>It wasn't anyone's fault. Shinji is idiotic and disguting, but pitiable.</br>  <br>No, he's not. And it was Sakura's fault.</br>  <br>It's wrong to blame the rape victim. Sakura is innocent.</br>  <br>She was never raped. Please read the VN.</br>  <br>She was. You're as bad as Shinji.</br>  <br>She wasn't and that's not even an insult.</br>    <br>I'm glad they are finally acknowledging the Pokemon clone with fluffy Eevee</br>  <br>Stop denying the victim's pain, you monster.</br>  <br>Guy Rin looks like he's waiting to have a bird land on his arm or something.</br>  Where the fuck are Fate/Mahjong Night translations? There's already 7 pages of it.  <br> using "pain" as an excuse to do whatever the hell you want and not take responsibility for any of it or worry about the consequences </br>  <br>Stop bashing on Sakura. She was raped and her selfish sister never tried to save her. It's normal for her to unleash her anger on others, especially when she has something very bad inside her body. By the way, you have to admit that she got raped at least once, right?</br>  <br> it's okay to kill innocents to vent your frustrations <br>How evil can a person get? And I don't mean Sakura, but people who think she was innocent.</br></br>  <br>I never said that. But people who support rape are the evil ones. Think about Sakura's feelings. She was a little girl and was left alone with a rapist.</br>  <br>She was never raped. But I guess all you're capable of is blaming others for her problems. This will be my last reply to you since this is going no where.</br>  <br>Sakura was raped, the omniscient narration said so . Shinjifags are truly the worst, they are ready to anything to deny or justify Shinji's actions.</br>  <br>holy shit HF manga was so edgy, even more than the LN.</br>  <br>i'll always find the Avenger troll funny, holy shit, how you can them screw up things so hard ?</br>  <br>Am I blind, or has Takeuchi gotten even fucking worse with his sameface shit?</br>   Fate／stay night [Heaven's Feel] [Taskohna].7z   https://mega.co.nz/#!7h0BSJZI!z2fzq<wbr>Hiez2n-WT-4yz9PFtNpjviQ_pwzEQHLbA1x<wbr>J1E</wbr></wbr>   <br> innocents <br>To be fair, some of them were real cunts.</br></br>  <br>Well in TM he supposedly said he specifically modeled the two protagonists after Shirou and Rin, but the guy on the left definitely is looking kind of like a stock male Takeuchi lead at this point.</br>  <br>TM Ace*</br>  <br>s-sauce ?</br>  <br>Yeah, in the last fight Saber only gets through Tsubame Gaeshi because they were smacking swords so long Saber wound up bending Assassin's sword, creating a gap large enough for her to dodge through when he did use the technique. They didn't really show that.</br>  <br> Fate/Zero (Fate／Zero -フェイト/ゼロ-) <br>http://rawcs.net/748.html</br></br>  <br> tfw no fluffy magic dog to pet <br><br>hell he might give more dicks to boot just for fun</br></br></br>  <br>You might actually be autistic.<br><br>You wont address any of his points and just keep spewing the same shit.<br><br>And you're going to do exactly that to this post too. Because you don't know how to have a conversation.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh please, he saw Kariya in that state and he was trained in the same manner, he just doesn't care.</br>  <br>Didn't other annons think he's the legendary Chinese sun killer?</br>  <br>He said that Sakura wasn't raped, I gave the proof that she was, and he is just keep denying the rape without delivering any argument. And you keep denying that as well.<br><br>Besides, why are you going full ad hominem? You're being as edgy as Shinji.</br></br></br>  Since we have shakespeare as a caster, kafka caster when?  <br>he was literally jealous about Tokiomi and did everything just to revenge against him and be trolled by Lancelot wanting to kill Saber, he wasn't trying to win the war.<br><br>he is one of the worsts.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for that</br>  <br><br>That has nothing to do with her being raped, but nice try. Shinji did abuse her, and for petty reasoning. That much you can't talk your way out of. He isn't some ultimate evil, but he IS a selfish brat that took advantage of someone in pain who took pity on him. There were plenty of chances for him to change and he never takes them until he gets humbled utterly or almost dies.<br><br>Also, that was scene pictured is about her running away from her problems in shame of killing Shinji accidently and buckling under the weight of all that happened, while still bad and a mistake on her part, it was not a confession of her being a murderer or liking killing people. The final battle with Rin showed through objective narration that she didn't hate the world, the bitterness of those 11 years came out from her suppressing it for so long. Emotional catharsis to be frank, fueled by a curse that even causes Heroic Spirits to be steeped in madness.<br><br>Case in point, Ilya saying the day before that she took the Shadow into herself in order to stop it from taking people while she was asleep, and Sakura hesitated after disabling Rin, trying to convince herself that killing her was the right thing to do before Shirou showed up. Her obvious emotional contradictions were apparent. While not a saint, that scene doesn't prove much of anything other than she broke down and coped with the more serious issues of the blackening tainting her soul, which is an actual thing, look it up in CM3. <br><br>The ones who believe she actually does want to kill people in vengeance for what happened to her missed....pretty much everything that showcased her personality throughout the route. There are so any examples to counter that it'd take all day to outline them all. The most glaring one where she and Shirou talk about magecraft, and she reveals why she it bothers her.<br><br>But context and looking at characters from anything other than a black and white perspective is a little beyond these threads.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sweet Jesus. How would be his status with a competent master?</br>  <br> That fucking stuttering </br>  <br>Gawain pls</br>    <br><br>While this was true, he had left home originally to nip Zouken's plan to use Aoi as a breeding factory, where she would have ended up like Shinji's mother, rotting flesh in the basement, so him bring protective over Aoi and hating Zouken is understandable. His pettiness with Tokiomi and delusions about Aoi being a victim are noted, but this should also be factored into the equation. The objective internal monologue even says he respected Tokiomi once.<br><br>Aoi and Tokiomi are as much to blame as he was for how things went down. Nasu himself says the Tohsaka couple is warped, and by their ideologies and reactions, I can't disagree. Warped, even if they loved their kids.<br><br>Tokiomi says he wants what is best for his daughters, and says he wished he could have given them the choice to become magi or not, but there is a fatal flaw in his reasoning. They didn't decide to be children born to a magus, and even further, Sakura didn't choose to be born second and unlucky enough to be born gifted anyway. That was Tokiomi's fault for not considering proper family planning, or setting up contigency plans for if he needed to give one of his children away. Sakura It's like a kid knocking up his prom dare without thinking of the consequences.<br><br>Aoi claims to understand what being the wife of a magus entails, but this was dubious at best. When Kariya questioned her about why Sakura, she never thought to actually talk with her childhood friend and instead told him it had nothing to do with him, never noting the desperation in his voice or asking why Sakura being adopted was bad, but passive aggressively blaming him for leaving the Matous, instead of questioning her husband's judgement.<br><br>All three were fuckups, even if they had good intentions originally.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> male rin <br> female shirou <br><br>Oh boy</br></br></br></br>  <br>What just happen?</br>  <br>Japanese swordsmen&gt; others<br><br>Not that hard to figure out</br></br></br>  <br>Nothing unusual, same as every night.</br>  <br> While this was true, he had left home originally to nip Zouken's plan to use Aoi as a breeding factory, where she would have ended up like Shinji's mother, rotting flesh in the basement, so him bring protective over Aoi and hating Zouken is understandable.

Warped, even if they loved their kids. <br><br>do you have the source of Nasu saying this ? i'm not doubting it, just curious since i like read his interviews and i didn't find this in the ones that i read.<br><br>  Sakura didn't choose to be born second and unlucky enough to be born gifted anyway. That was Tokiomi's fault for not considering proper family planning, or setting up contigency plans for if he needed to give one of his children away. Sakura It's like a kid knocking up his prom dare without thinking of the consequences. <br><br>that is why i can't accept Tokiomi apologists, even if it was a magus duty, he just saw her as a waste, even if she doesn't receive a crest she could be a good magus anyway, she would only work harder for it, just look at Touko, even though Aozaki family secrets has been passed to Aoko she managed to do pretty well by herself, even receiving a sealing designation<br><br> All three were fuckups, even if they had good intentions originally. <br><br>I agree, but Kariya could have done better if he forgets Aoi, she is a fucking cunt and seeking her approval just make him worse.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That rape scene is from the Zero manga</br>  <br>The scene in episode 1 was showing her Command Seal growing, secondary-kun. It's foreshadowing to Heaven's Feel.</br>  <br>why do you think? where do you think they go and what do you think they do? use your imagination</br>  Rin did I ever tell you about the time your father burned your good uncle Kariya alive, despite the fact Kariya just wanted to save your little sister from a terrible terrible fate of rape and abuse? He was a good father.  <br>We don't know anything about Pestilence powerlevel and Lancelot can hijack Sphynx or Mesektet since those are NPs. I'm not sure about his temple though.</br>  Any Melty Blood players recognize a "mbaacctool.exe" by mauve?  <br> where do you think they go <br>In all four mouths, of course.</br></br>  <br> You can watch Fate/Zero, but it will probably spoil some plot points of HF <br><br>UFO's making these under the assumption you've watched Fate/Zero</br></br></br>  <br>They aren't the only one.</br>  <br><br>because she is a passive agressive masochist</br></br>  <br>It was less than a year ago Shirou beat Shinji up after he confirmed he was beating her, and she still hates the rape, but this has just become another wormpit for her already. She can't beat him physically in her condition, and there's no point so she just goes "I can't win".<br><br>Only recently did Emiya start to reawaken the light inside of her that goes "Maybe this isn't hopeless, maybe I can do something about this". However its only in HF that this light starts to take root entirely. Its kind of an entire point that for ten years she's been living without hope a bit dead on the inside after she was initially broken. It was Shirou that Tiger that fixed her soul.<br><br>Game says its rape, its shown as rape, flat out shows its still rape and she doesn't want it, it is rape even if others want to say "She always wanted it". He does still beat her as we've seen, just opens the Emiya's door and straight up decks her, no reservations. He didn't care back then and still doesn't. Shirou would have beat him up again if she didn't stop him.<br><br>We can try to paint it some way, but you are going against the game itself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tools been around forever. I have no idea who mauve is though.</br>  <br>She's a hundred percent sadist, but her true self only activates when her limit break is active.</br>  <br>I figured it out, it's to enable keyboard functionality in MBAACC</br>  The first time for her to get raped is before she was killed Shinji in HF?<br>So how about before that time?<br>I heard she had sexed with him cause of her grandfather?<br>So she accept it in that time?</br></br></br>  <br>He can't hijack any non-weapon NP.</br>  <br>Uh, he can hijack Sphynx and Mesektet.</br>  <br>But that's Gawain. Not Numeral of the Saint Gawain. That's definitely not Numeral of the Saint Gawain armed with Excalibur, Galatine, Excalibur Galatine, Rhongowennan, Fail-Not, the Bleeding Spear, the Holy Grail while borrowing Arondight, Secace, Carnwennan, Marmyadose, Caliburn, Lancelot's white with red stripes Shields, Arthur's Priwen, Percival's flame retardant shield from his bros which are more numerous and impressive than the number of penises in the Whore of Babylon's mouth.<br><br>Speaking of bros, did you know that Gawain made more appearances than any other knight &amp; thus has many friends? This means Gawain should have King Arthur, Sir Key, Sir Bedivere, Sir Percival, Sir Lancelot, Sir Galahad, Sir Erec (ranked above Sir Lancelot), Sir Cligès (who kicked Lancelot's ass in a joust), the Green Knight &amp; more lesser known knights that virtually every other knight?</br></br></br>  <br> Gawain <br> friends <br>I was with you until here</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4<wbr>9crU71miHObWRvV2tDUllYTjQ/edit<br><br>The stuff about Aoi and Tokiomi can be found her, check Aoi's and Rin's entries.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>http://tmdict.com/en/#en</br>  <br> kind <br>Do you see that face? Does that face look like a face of mercy? I would not touch that apple if I was Shinji, that shit's obviously poisoned or something.</br></br>  <br> Implying Gawain isn't friendly with everyone <br>Unlike bro-killing Lancelot, Gawain appears more times than anyone else. He frequently takes a supporting role because he's such a bro. He lend Lancelot his armor &amp; horse, he let Tristain have Fail-Not, etc. Gawain is best bro. <br><br>Many writers wrote their OCs as not defeationg Gawain but rather having a good fight with him. This was to establish their OC's power without undermining Gawain. By many writers I don't mean many French ones who dumbed down Gawain to make Lancelot look better.</br></br></br></br>  <br>she probably begged to be raped and beaten, as VN describes her as eternaly horny slut that needs her daily dose of cum to even think soberly<br><br>she is the main reason Shinji lost his sanity</br></br></br>    <br>Fate/Zero</br>  <br>Didn't Lancelot kill him?</br>  <br>Non-canon.</br>  <br>Mordred killed him in the Nasuverse.</br>  <br> Implying Lancelot killed him <br> Implying Mordred wasn't lucky enough to hit an old wound <br> Implying it was Numeral of the Saint Gawain with Excalibur, Galatine, Excalibur Galatine, Rhongowennan, Fail-Not, casting spells when Merlin isn't around, the Shield of Judas Maccabee, the sword that refused to kill Gawain for being the best knight in the world while Gawain is the hero of the Grail Quest &amp; therefore has the Holy Grail &amp; the Bleeding Spear and borrowing Arondight, Secace, Carnwennan, Marmyadose, Caliburn, Lancelot's white with red stripes Shields, Arthur's Priwen, Percival's flame retardant shield from his bros which are more numerous and impressive than the number of penises in the Whore of Babylon's mouth </br></br></br>  <br>Lancelot defeated him by knocking him out heavily, but shown mercy to his fellow ally of the round table. However, Mordred didn't show the same kindness to his fellow Knight and struck him in the same spot where Lancelot has struck ultimately ending him.</br>  What about Percival? I think he's mentioned like once in the entire Nasuverse.<br>Why's that?</br>  <br><br>No, that was because she was using her powers in that route, normally, she recovers enough magical energy that she doesn't need it replenished, but just barely.<br><br>Shinji just humiliates her because it's the only recourse he has to alleviate his shame at not being the heir, and he misjudged her compassion for making fun of him. Even though being the heir kind of sucks. Always wondered why, if he knows what goes on in the basement, he still seems to think being the heir is such an enviable position. You'd think having to roll around in rotting flesh while your soul and body get turned into a parasite nest is something most people wouldn't want. <br><br>Either way, he is too chicken to stand up to Zouken without a servant behind him, so picking on Sakura is the only thing he can really do.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> his <br>her.</br></br>  <br>I don't know, it's odd. For a series so centerred around the Holy Grail you'd think that the original Grail Knight would be prominent.</br>  <br> UBW <br> good <br>Not really, it was alright but by no means good.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, it was great.</br>  Did they ever explain why gil kept meeting with Sakura?    <br><br>I remember reading somewhere that Shinji wasn't always AS insufferable. It just got flaired up real bad because of the Holy Grail War making him feel super inferior to Sakura more than normal.</br></br>  <br><br>Ooh, thank you. They made a site for it. I didn't know.<br><br>But this:<br><br> Tohsaka Sakura <br><br> She had already become Matou Sakura by the time she appeared in Fate/Zero, but, well, I've always wanted to use this name. Somehow, it makes her seem more gallant, like… Tohyama Sakura, or something. <br>Though she only showed up twice, at the beginning and the end of the book, when you consider the fact that the whooooole time she was off-screen she was being tortured in a worm hell that violates child pornography laws, well, even in Fate/Zero her misery index probably rates higher than anyone else's. Also, the Character Material book that was released right when I was in the middle of writing had a cute illustration of Sakura as a child in it. When I saw it, I thought, “Right now, I'm creating such a cruel world for this girl!” It was a huge load on my spirit. You're so mean, Mr. Takeuchi. Bully me some more!<br>By the way, in the first draft, Kariya's death was much more inhumane. It was one of the few scenes that ended up being totally vetoed by the original author. I can still hear him screaming for my blood even now…! As a result, Sakura's monologue was toned down considerably. No, really, it was! I swear!<br><br>That was that hack Urobuchi who wrote this, wasn't it? That dude ain't right in the head.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Originally, Kariya was suppose to be wormed out of his mind so he raped Aoi and strangled her to death, then in still coked up on worm fuckery went back and raped Sakura before ultimately dying and falling in the worm pit. I'd say he has some issues.</br>  <br>While he's in the hospital, she rapes the fuck out of Shinji every day and every night. Her sexual appetite needs to be satisfied and Shirou ain't around.</br>  <br>Well I don't remember anyone talking about it in the anime</br>  <br>UBW is truly the best end for Shinji.<br><br>In the absence of a Broji route at least.</br></br></br>    <br>https://<span>youtu.be/ij02uPHTDe0  [ ]<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/zVKoGTljTOM  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>You're only saying that because he doesn't die a violent death only in UBW. But being raped by wormslut every day after being turned into the Grail's vessel is a living hell. Grandpa was probably laughing his ass off the entire time.</br>  So if the Grail opened Shinji's magic circuits does it mean that he can be a mage after UBW?  <br>Nope. He's Sakura's boy toy now. She's the heir to the Matou name and can do whatever she wants with Shinji.</br>  <br>Ilya is pretty much the only reason I like Fate/Stay Night.</br>  <br>Didn't Gil killed Zouken though? It's weird that he had a scene in the worm chamber but there aren't any worms there. Zouken is also nowhere to be seen.</br>  <br> Didn't Gil killed Zouken though? <br>Nope<br><br> It's weird that he had a scene in the worm chamber but there aren't any worms there. <br><br>But there are worms there, Gil even steps on one.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At the end of UBW Zouken's still around, inside of Sakura.</br>  <br><br>Why didn't they show us what gil and sakura were talking about? This is a huge plot hole</br></br>  <br>You will have to wait for HF secondary-kun</br>  <br><br><br>You guys need to get that headcanon checked. I think it's broken.</br></br></br>  <br>They're saving it for Heaven's Feel, secondary.</br>  <br>You just don't know how badly Sakura needs to fuck every day.</br>  <br><br> The girl made no attempt to fight back </br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Rj5<wbr>G0GGTyQ4</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Accurate</br>  <br>This is actually a better trailer than what ufotable made.</br>  Because she's a retarded shounen teenager, like the rest of the fate stay night characters.Why did you make me watch the VNs /a/? So boring god damn.  This thread needs some more of best girl. Enjoy, people.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1Hj<wbr>Jmcz20l0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Slut.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1Hj<wbr>Jmcz20l0</wbr>  [ ]<br>Holy shit, I thought it was just Taiga that got voiced in this section, this is fucking terrific.<br><br><br><br> Sakura shuts her down <br>This shit, Sakura? This is why I'm a Rin man.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he's never even been raped </br>  <br><br>The scene said she had fought him off when it first started, then he used blackmail. Besides, beating the shit out of him wouldn't solve anything. Hell, Shirou beat the shit out of him, and he still didn't stop. She knows how crazed he ends up getting, so it would get to the point where either she would have to kill him or he would kill her. Because he is that deluded.</br></br>  <br><br>Well dude, come on, Rider claims to Sakura to be her wingman and then tries to get to get that sword sharpened in her sheath. Don't tell me you wouldn't be mad at your friend for trying to mack the same girl he said he would hook you up with behind your back? Because that is what is happening and why Sakura is kind of irritated. It's the principle of the thing about Medusa not being honest.<br><br>Look at UBW Good, Rin is attracted to Saber and still gets jealous from her and Shirou just talking. That scene you posted from Hollow just had her being honest about being attacked to Rider. <br><br>'Sides, there was one scene where Sakura passed up a shopping day with Shirou to take care of her club juniors and tells him to have fun with Rider like it ain't an issue. So again, it's being honest and upfront about things that is important to her. You can bet money if Medusa said upfront she liked Shirou, Sakura would oblige, if only because she does feel that they should be closer and for Rider to act less reserved.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course not! I'm a man. I could just fight my rapist off.</br>  <br>What if your rapist was either a stronger man or an attractive woman?</br>  <br> or an attractive woman <br>Then it's not rape.</br></br>  <br> attractive woman <br>Not rape<br> stronger man <br>Shinji is not significantly stronger than Sakura, I'd imagine.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The random people she slaughtered were cunts?<br> inb4 replying to a 7 hour old post </br></br>  <br><br>It's bait. Just move on.<br><br><br><br>He isn't, she <br>1.) Doesn't want to hurt him <br>2.)as another anon said already violence doesn't really stop him from coming back again.

He uses blackmail when she doesn't do what he wants <br>"Come on Sakura, or I'll tell everyone that I've been raping you!"<br>That'll work, right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Seems legit.</br>  <br>Rough sex</br>  <br><br>You forget that he is crazy enough to use the Bloodfort in broad daylight. The blackmail is that he would get Shirou involved to get back at her. Not just that she is ashamed about the abuse.<br><br>Also, he basically tells her over and over, that if she's sorry for taking his place, she should continue to make up for it. It's emotional blackmail. Nasu notes that things would be better if she treated him like a piece of dirt, but obviously, she doesn't want to do that, because she is actually a decent person.</br></br></br></br>  <br> she doesn't want to do that, because she is actually a decent person. <br>She's a coward who doesn't want to face her problems. She's the same sort of person as Shinji.</br></br>  <br>Anon, plz. she's worse than Shinji, at least he could actually do shit.

Sakura knows Shinji. And how he'll go overboard at very petty things. So instead of fearing him, she is afraid of what he'll do if she messes with his fragile pride, as you can see in canon he does some hilariously stupid shit.<br><br>Next thing she would see him get Shirou involved with the Matous and her plan to keep him uninvolved in that goes down the sewer, because Shinji was butthurt. <br><br>Killing, breaking his legs, breaking him mentally, or getting him arrested are pretty much the only things that would stop him. And him getting arrested would raise too many questions with Shirou. I mean really, the guy only calmed down because he got to feel what Sakura feels all the time with the grail experiments.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Archer's and Lancer's are the only really good ones<br><br>I'd say Kirei is as shit as Rin but then again, I'm too used to Nakata so it's not fair to this guy.</br></br></br>  <br><br>If you have to treat a person like garbage to fix them, that is a fault of the person, not you. That was the point Nasu was making.</br></br>  <br>That voice acting for Shirou is actually decent. I'm not really a fan of Seibah though</br>  <br> How does not beating the guy up count as cowardice?  <br>Uh</br></br>  <br>10/10 holy shit</br>  <br><br>So then Rin must be a coward too, because she doesn't beat him up either.<br><br>There is a flaw to your logic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Funimation needs to get some more fucking VAs. I don't even hate them as much as most of /a/, but it's ridiculous.</br>  <br> fandub is better <br>Get your shit together Aniplex<br>This is why unions are bad for America, god bless Thatcher</br></br></br>  Why do you guys suddenly care about some dub?  <br>I guess he could recognize a lighter as a weapon? would it turn it into a flamethrower since it became a noble phantasm?</br>  <br>But Rin did beat him up. Multiple times.</br>  <br> Is he the reason Sakura and Rider have such sexy bodies as well? <br>I don't see the problem with that part, please explain</br></br>  <br>Last time I checked Funimation isn't dubbing this, Aniplex is.</br>  <br>Personally, I only watch anime if it's dubbed.</br>  <br><br>No, she threatened him, there is a difference. And then he went to the church to get a new Servant to get revenge.<br><br>Shirou is the only one who beats him up, and it just makes him crazier.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Ah, I recognized some of the VAs and just figured that's who was doing it. <br> My point still stands, however. </br></br>  <br> some wanker decided to summon Avenger in the 3rd <br>I still dont understand this. What were they thinking? what was the plan?</br></br>  <br> kicking someone and slamming him against the wall is merely threatening <br>I mean sure, she could have killed him, but she beat him up</br></br>  <br>Where are these coming from?<br> Can I get a folder? </br></br>  <br>They thought that the Zoroastrian Satan would be a powerful Servant not some random farmer.</br>  <br>All Evils in The World sounds pretty powerful, doesn't it?</br>  <br><br>Fine, I'll concede that point. But now the original point, did it work, or did it make things worse?<br><br>They didn't even get any info out of that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what you get for trusting ragheads.</br>  <br>It kept Shinji out of their way for a while. <br><br>To be honest, any reasonable person would have had Shinji arrested.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He actually could've taught Shirou a thing or two.</br></br>    <br> All the masters and servants have some personality connection. <br>And theirs was a deep dislike of each other. That was it.</br></br>  <br><br>Yes, it kept him out of the way to plan even stupider things. Like a kid going to grab a gun because the bullies made fun of him. Letting him go was a mistake, especially because the Bloodfort was activated because Rin underestimates how butthurt he would get at her dumping his advances. It's kind of hilarious in hindsight, you would think she would Gandr the guy to put him to sleep so he doesn't do yet another stupid thing.<br><br>My point in all this is that Sakura knows he does stupid things and has a frail ego. Which is a bad combo, it has nothing to do with how courageous she is. Shinji is just friggin' loopy.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>HA, What a hypocrite, he says all of this yet didn't he save Bazett? She could of been dancing with the grime reaper if it wasn't for him.</br></br>  <br> Not available <br>Thanks for nothing</br></br>  <br> killing all the servants one by one. <br> one by one. <br> Not all at the same time <br><br>The fuck? the guy was famous for fighting 100+ guys at the same time and winning, not to mention all the hotheads who kept going after him in groups to try and claim to have beaten him, wild west style</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> not getting one of the central themes of Fate is humans being somewhat hypocritical and inconsistent in their stances </br></br>  <br><br>they should've made Crispin Freeman to be Archer instead<br><br>the rest are shit</br></br></br></br>  <br> "A human can't save anyone except himself" <br> saves Bazetto </br></br>  <br>Best girl needs more love.</br>  <br>The announcement version with the rolling Japanese comments is better.</br>  <br>Somewhat? We're all hypocrites and inconsistent all the time.</br>  <br>Are you trying to imply that Avenger is human?</br>  <br> that resolution </br>  <br>This image triggers me.<br>The bait wins</br></br>  <br>Bait always win, as long as you reply to it.</br>  <br><br>He's more human than any of the other servants, he wasn't a legend just some random dude that got tortured and was sacrificed in the name of humanity's evil</br></br>  <br> I actually like these voices. </br>  <br> PS2 </br>  <br/>  <br> 7 layers <br> not 7 proxies </br></br>  <br><br>It sounds like someone you don't want to summon at all! that's my point.<br><br>"Hey, let's summon the super strong, ultra evil "source of all evil"! what could go wrong!?"<br><br>"Couldnt he kill us somehow?"<br>"Nah, we'll use a command seal to order him not to"<br>"Couldnt he then torture us forever?"<br>"Commend seal"<br>"Can't he cause a disaster to indirectly kill us or let us live untouched on the eternal hell in which he could turn earth?"<br>"Command seal"<br>"Congrats, you are now out of command seals"<br>"Shut up!"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not liking the Ghost Stories dub </br>  <br> 1731x1331 <br>The way I see it, someone either stretched the fuck out of it, or they were emulating it at 1x resolution, fullscreen, and took a screenshot. Looks like crap.</br></br>  <br>Does it even count as a dub, at that point?</br>  <br> To start anew on a blank slate, rinsed of the humiliation suffered after their defeat in the second war, the Einzberns had contrived for absolute victory in the conflict to follow. By fully utilizing the next sixty years to compare and consider all possibilities, they managed to narrow down the potentials to two Heroic Spirits. <br><br> Their first option was to alter the system of the Greater Grail itself and summon a unique Avenger-class Servant. The Heroic Spirit would be Angra Mainyu, the reverse hero who bore the six billion curses of the world. Once brought to this world, this nameless figure – crowned as the ‘king of demons’, a living calamity made for carnage – would certainly slaughter all other Masters and Servants and allow them to activate the Greater Grail. <br><br> Their second option was to abuse one of the systems installed in the Greater Grail by summoning the ultimate Ruler-class Servant, meant to be an impartial authority whom regulated the progress of the War. They would then make use of the great privilege possessed by Ruler: its Command Spells for the other Servants. <br><br> Brawn… or brains? After much contemplation, the Einzberns chose the latter. One could say that they picked the safer option; perhaps their previous defeat had robbed them of their confidence in powers higher than they. <br><br> The Heroic Spirit they chose to summon as Ruler would be a figure whom had been as close to a ‘Saint’ as you could possibly find in the Far East, where the war would take place; at the same time, the sainthood of this tragic youth had never been recognized. His name was Amakusa Shirou Tokisada. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> While the Einzberns dearly wished to call forth a proper Heroic Spirit befitting the Ruler class rather than some nameless Eastern hero, the act of summoning a Ruler was already a severe interference in the normal operating format of the Holy Grail War. He was a compromise – though the overwhelming advantage of his Command Spells could hardly be seen as such. The summoned Amakusa Shirou was neither outstanding in combat nor proficient in thaumaturgy to the level of a Caster-class Servant, but he continued to win, and survive, in the Third Holy Grail War. He was ever heedful and never gambled, fulfilling his duties even as he thoroughly cemented his defenses. As the third war drew to a close, the Einzberns clearly stood closer than any other to the Greater Grail. <br><br> However, the unexpected occurred. One participant of the war – Darnic Prestone Yggdmillennia, head of the Yggdmillennia clan – discovered by chance the Greater Grail and, borrowing the power of the military, embarked on an operation to seize it. After that, the Third Holy Grail War fell apart. In the brutal thaumaturgical conflict that followed, surviving Servants tore one another apart in pursuit of the Greater Grail, and the Master of the Einzberns was killed in the shambles of battle. </br></br></br>  <br> brought to this world, this nameless figure – crowned as the ‘king of demons’, a living calamity made for carnage <br> king of demons <br> living calamity <br> made for carnage <br><br>Those are really just reasons NOT to summon him, you know?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> seal </br>  <br>...you serious?<br>Alright, what will you command it to do or not do with your command seal?</br></br>  <br> not 令呪 </br>  <br>It's command spell.</br>  <br>The official translation is "spell". The previous one was "mantra", although it was retconned by the official Grand Order site.<br><br>And to answer your question: geas him. Serves you or you order him to die. If he doesn't want to, you're screwed.</br></br></br>  <br>The Einzberns are not very smart.</br>  <br>More of a parody. Hell, they probably wouldn't even need a license at that point, because it's fair use.</br>  The Einzberns aren't very bright, they trusted Xx_MagusKilla_Xx for starter.<br><br>Now, this page is giving me so much trouble, I can't do it right for some reasons. I suppose I'll leave it for last.</br></br>  <br> ザフィールウン成敗じゃない </br>  ITT: Characters that are literally you.

Only she had someone who loved her and friends.  I've walked through tis world's darkness, I know what it's like to be alone even after doing the right thing and people deeming me a monster. I have a brother who actually does hate me and I try to make the world a better place at my job from the shadows.  I love these threads so much.  <br>But it's mostly the same tired old joke repeated over and over again.</br>  This is the only correct answer for everyone here.  <br>are you than autist that self-inserts as hanekawa?</br>  Intelligent, nihilistic and with a wicked sense of humor.  <br>Im just a big titted girl teehee!</br>    <br>Just don't go into a meltdown and project your shit ever again</br>  I hallucinate in class because I'm god  <br> he thinks that guy is me <br>You're such a dumb boy.</br></br>    Intelligent, nihilistic and with a wicked sense of humor.

Thanks anon   The stream's on neetball, right??   <br>That DownyPire is pefect and that Shiho is good enough, but, Jesus, that chubby sensei is repellent.</br>  I should stop trying to convince myself that it'll be fun.  I really hope that the reason Akane looks so tame in the art so far is so they can catch anime only fags off guard with the batshit insane faces later.    <br>You know, rewatching the PV, I am excited. It does look fun.</br>  Which groups are going to sub it?  <br>CR.</br>  <br><br>Compare and Contrast</br></br>    <br>My brain is too LEWD.</br>  <br>Anime design is much more mature, and less endearing.

Don't try to pull the 'b-but it's unique' card on me. Yes it's a fun series but the art is just bad. The anime doesn't look too good either though</br></br></br>  So is JWWW the Federation Force of /a/?  <br>Why</br>  <br>where you at?</br>  OP: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>wx4hq</wbr>  <br>It's pretty good. Most definitely won't be OPOTS, but it'll be pretty high in the rankings.</br>  <br>So this is what it feels like to have your expectations dashed before your eyes.</br>  <br>flipland</br>  I like it. It didn't look bad, the voices are better than I expect, except Dumpire, and the OST is really good.<br><br>Too bad the threads are going to suck because a few people will bitch every second because it doesn't look the exact same as the manga. I hope it doesn't affect the manga threads.</br></br>  <br>I kind of like it.<br><br>For some reason, my first thought was that it feels a bit weird to have a male singer do the opening of a romcom series like this one.</br></br></br>  <br>What happened to her right hand</br>  <br> I hope it doesn't affect the manga threads <br>It's been affecting the manga threads for months already, how can you possibly expect them to stop now?</br></br>  <br>The whole point of the "ugly" art is to emphasize the facial features for comedic and emotional effect. This adapation completely ruins that, which is why it's shit.</br>  So, when are we making the petition to cancel this anime?<br>Metroid fans on /v/ made a petition to stop the spin-off which isn't a game they wanted, and it has 50k signatures so far.

Also, the reaction faces in the manga are god-tier.</br>  <br>NO<br>YOU CAN FILTER ALL CAPS THOUGH<br> In all seriousness, is there anyone who hates this, or is everyone just trolling. </br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>If you're someone who used to read the manga, this is terrible and one of the worst adaptations this season.<br><br>If you're a retarded secondary onlyanimefag you probably going to say what this retard said </br></br></br>  Please tell me im not the only one who thinks that their eyes need work<br><br>Its like staring into the void<br>It feels so empty</br></br></br>  <br>I'll start a petition to get you banned mate.</br>   Any doujin and merchandise will be in the anime's style <br> Whenever you read the manga from now on you will hear the characters speaking in those voices. </br>  <br>I'll start a petition to get our mom off my dick, bitch be clinging</br>  <br>Sure thing anon.</br>  <br>so i shouldn't bother watching it?</br>  <br> I'll start a petition to get our mom off my dick, bitch be clinging <br><br>  our mom <br><br>I genuinely feel sorry for you because of this typo.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yep, stay away from this shit and just keep reading the manga.</br>  <br>thanks</br>  I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THE FIRST EPISODE AIRED<br><br>HOW IS IT SO FAR!?</br></br>   blank stares the animation   <br>But how will I know which capslock crusader is valiantly defending the Jitsu Wa manga against the tyrannical evils of the anime?</br>  I thought this was more "Stupid monster girls who just happen to be in a harem" instead of "My harem is full of stupid monster girls".

Couldn't even make it through the whole episode.  <br><br>I think all existing fansub groups except Commie have already announced their plan for this season.</br></br>  <br>Other way around. Bottom is old, top is new.</br>  <br>Jokes on you, Christmas was ruined ever since the Panty and Stocking ending.</br>   "just drop it" <br>Thank you, /a/. You've helped me scratch another anime off of my list.</br>  <br>I wish the manga didn't change the MCs design. He had a unique look to him at the beginning.</br>  <br>This is why I'm holding out. <br><br>The artstyle right now looks too stiff when it should be rubbery and loose. Which makes me think that their plan is to slowly transition to rubbery just like the manga did.</br></br></br>  <br>Commie usually picks up a quite a few shows, hopefully this is one of them.  inb4 memes. </br>  <br>I wonder if he changed his art on his own or if his editor suggested it.</br>  <br>You're saying the manga did it on purpose?</br>  Who are those sluts?<br><br><br>He wouldn't fit surroundings</br></br></br>   You'll never get to see her heart violently break animated.   Man this looks bad, why did the author thought this was good?<br>I like moeshit, but this time is no good</br>  <br>Even the pages themselves have monster secrets.<br>This is actually a horror/comedy, not a romance/comedy.</br></br>  <br> Who are those sluts? <br>you made my day</br></br>  What's up with the torrent? It keeps going from 1 mb to 50.0 kbs.  20 seconds in and i can already tell that this is going to ruin the manga.  It's certainly not as bad as this thread makes it out to be, but it could be a lot better. Main gripe besides not following the manga designs, even the most recent ones, was them going too light on the exaggerated reactions. It did get a decent chuckle out of me when Dumpire calls out Asahi on him pretending he didn't see anything, and the quiz thing at the end was pretty good.<br>I'll wait three episodes before deciding on whether or not the anime's worth following, with most of my verdict stemming from how cute anime Alium gets.</br>  <br> was them going too light on the exaggerated reactions <br>Again, the first chapter barely has those. Hell, the anime has more.</br></br>  that was fine <br>what are you autists arguing about?</br>  I'm not entirely satisfied with the first episode, but overall it wasn't as bad as the posts in this thread had me believe. Sure, it's not a 1:1 adaptation of the manga, but in a sense that's good, as if they alter the earlier content and introduce more characters early on, they can get to the better stuff later on. That's a good thing, since even if this is going to be 2 cour (which I doubt), if they did a 1:1 adaptation we wouldn't see Akane (best girl, and her introduction marks the point where the comedy gets good) for several episodes. My only concern in that respect is that I hope they don't try to put an emphasis on the story chapters and skip out on a lot of the comedy.<br><br>I definitely get the criticisms of the choice of VAs above - Shimada was the only one I thought was good at first, but some of the others are starting to grow on me so I'll just accept that it differs from my view of what I wanted and enjoy it as much as I can anyway.<br><br>The anime character designs seem to be fine for the male characters, but pretty bad for female characters. I'll accept them if they manage to capture the expressiveness of the manga's artstyle from later chapters, though, but I'll hold out judgement on that one. Once I got used to it, Shiragami's anime face was fine in the end, but I don't see me ever prefering this to the manga.<br><br>The music was decent as well, nothing special, but better than I'd expected.<br><br>Overall, I'm expecting this series to turn out fine, but not to be an acceptable substitute for the manga. I'll keep up with it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just one cour, 13 episodes.</br>  I liked it, The MC having a flaw instead of being a beta is pretty nice.<br><br>Vampire chick seems okay, I really like the ED.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I read the manga too and I thought it was alright, I had a bit of fun with the episode. Not entirely sure about Aizawa's voice and appearance, but it might turn out ok.</br></br>  <br>Kill yourself you retarded tripfag.</br>  <br>Oh, didn't realise that had been confirmed, but it was what I expected. Good thing the adaptation isn't a 1:1 kind of adaptation then, else we wouldn't see Akane until about half way through.</br>  <br>Flaw was forgotten in manga as fast as original artstyle</br>  <br> I-I read the maga guys I SWEAR  <br><br>SECONDARIES GTFO.</br></br></br>  <br>But the first episode of Gate was far better than the manga.<br> This however, is not ;_; </br></br>  Decent episode. It's not a masterpiece but it's good enough.<br><br><br>While this is true, the author remembers it from time to time.</br></br></br>  <br>Someone, really did tap this. Probably sedused her with candy, though.</br>  <br><br>Maybe you'll believe me if I voice this complaint. They kind of ruined Mikan, she's best girl and deserved a better seiyuu than what she got.</br></br>  <br> Maybe you'll believe me if I voice this complaint. <br>Don't worry, you don't need to try to convince a shitposter making irrelevant assumption-based ad hominem attacks to fairly unprovocative posts on an anonymous imageboard of anything. Just ignore him.</br></br>  Well that was a fucking entertaining episode, really good. Good job IMS.<br><br> mangafags hating on it non-stop <br>Ease up a little, the episode was good. It made me want to read the manga, so it's fulfilling its purpose.<br>The VA choice was fucking great, the vampire girl's voice was cute as fuck. MC's gimmick was fresh and interesting too. The bro's were bro's and not male side characters for the sake of it.<br><br> muh art style and voices <br>Pseudo-primary mangafags really are autistic, from the looks of manga pages in this thread, it was faithful. The voices are also subjective. because mangafags already have voices for the characters in their heads. They won't be content with any voices that aren't those.<br>10/10 adaptation so far. Will watch more and visit the threads often!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mangafags <br>More like mangafag because it's just one guy shitposting.</br></br>  <br><br>I really just wanted to vent a complaint about Mikan. I actually re-winded to the part where she shows up thinking I might be able to get used to the voice. It's impossible though, she's terrible. The voice doesn't fit at all and the seiyuu is mediocre.</br></br>  <br>This actually bothered me. As far as I can remember, there weren't really many exaggerated faces in the first couple chapters. The fact that they got thrown in because they're more prevalent later kind of irked me. Just a minor nitpick. Overall I liked it, even if it bastardized the art style completely,</br>  <br>She's fine when she's doing the evil queen act but yes, the rest of the time she's bad.</br>  <br>This, this was the only good thing about the first episode. That one short part of the whole scene. The rest was garbage.</br>  <br> More like mangafag because it's just one guy shitposting. <br>Nah, probably between a half and two-thirds of the people in the thread have read the manga, and most of those are expressing dissatisfaction with at least some elements of it. There's only one guy who thinks it's ABSOLUTELY AWFUL WORST THING EVER and is butthurt enough to shitpost in response to anything said, though.</br></br>  It was boring as fuck, thanks for nothing /a/  Welp, first episode done with and I've got to say; neither the fucked up faces, nor Dumpire's missing cleavage, not even Alium's extra girlish voice made me as mad as Sakura and Mikan's voices. Mother of fuck, I heard Sakura had a gay voice but this is bloody ridiculous. Wasn't he a former badass? What the shit? Also Mikan. Oh god, I don't even know what's wrong with it but she has by far the most misfit voice in the entire cast, holy shit.  Just finished watching, and god fucking damn it, they  did a good job with the score, and I was laughing the whole way. Having read the manga I think it's a pretty good adaption and can't wait to see more.   <br>Yeah, they sound like a completely different character from what I had in mind.</br>  <br> and most of those are expressing dissatisfaction with at least some elements of it. <br><br>And this is not a bad thing. I'm a mangafag and I liked the episode but I still have some complaints, but this is normal. No adaptation is perfect.</br></br></br>  <br> 59 Posters when it was streamed  <br> 109 posters now <br><br>Probably more than three<br><br>Probably more than three</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No adaptation is perfect. <br>Yep you're right but this one is more than terrible, even worse than Triage X.</br></br>  <br> And this is not a bad thing. <br>I'm not saying it is, I'm one of them. Sorry if my post sounded a little misleading.</br></br>  Why am I getting vague TRUST ME TRUST ME TRUST ME TRUST ME vibes from the ED?  <br>Shit looked nothing like the manga and some voices sounded weird to me, especially Sakurada. But I enjoyed it, guess I had fun. I know the manga by heart but it cracked me up every single second of it.</br>  I didn't even make it 10 minutes  I suppose it was too much to expect Gintama-tier reactions from the cast but the next episode preview segment was decent in that regard.  At least Dumon was in the OP.  It was ok  <br> But the first episode of Gate was far better than the manga. <br><br/></br></br>  Everyone is so off-model all the time I can't even tell when they're on-model.  OP sucked until this.<br><br>Laughs 1/0 Groans<br><br>Off to a good start.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And looked  awful ;_; <br><br> That mouth. </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, that one single shot gives me some hope for future episodes. The first few chapters were pretty lame, too.</br>  <br> IMS <br>TMS</br></br>  It wasn't that bad  <br><br>Not that guy but I kind of enjoyed how they didn't rush through the invasion really. Not to mention more cheap gore isn't necessary a good thing. I also didn't mind the loli either. It gave a bit more depth to the slaughter of the invasion after the gore was removed.</br></br>   Densei's voice <br>Who do I have to kill to fix this?</br>  Correct me if i retarded. But didnt MC like the robot alien first, even confessed, but after getting rejected by her, after some time fell for Vampire?  <br>Read the manga.</br>  <br><br>Seriously. I know there's a VA I had pictured for her already, but I can't find an example.</br></br>  <br> even confessed <br>Got shot down before he even confessed, but yes.</br></br>  There is hope?  This has got to be the most cancerous thread on /a/ right now. I can already tell that these will be the threads to avoid during this season. <br><br>Anime was fine, quit crying you fucking faggots.</br></br>  How long until someone find-replaces all instances of this to My Monster Secret?  <br>But at least the manga gets better, this is an adaptation and that means the same thing as episode 1 is going to happen over and over until the end,</br>  <br>It was just one guy shitposting after the livewatch. The thread got better after HS released the episode and people watched that it wasn't bad.</br>  <br>You obviously haven't been to the NNB thread then.</br>  <br><br>And again, why are you only anime fags so obvious? every single person who's actually part of the oldfags in these threads say this shit is fucking awful.</br></br>  <br> Being this newfag <br> Not knowing about Saekano/Fate/Yahari threads <br><br>Go back to </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuu Kobayashi?</br>  <br>I hope Shima rapes you.</br>  <br> reading comprehension  <br><br>I said they'll be the most cancerous threads THIS season you fucking retard.</br></br></br>  <br>Being new has nothing to do with this, you fucking faggot.
