Nothing the characters did was close to being an affectation embodying some super deep philosophy. It was literally Thorfinn being depressed as fuck because he lost his purpose in life and wanting to do something more than senseless killing for once in his life. I can understand not liking it, or finding it boring, but it was as far from being pretentious as you can get.</br></br></br>  <br>Shoving down ideals that would never work in the world that have been shown so far in the fiction, yet for that moment, is the magical solution. <br><br>And the result, the "feels" feel fake.

In fact, I could have agreed with you entirely barring this fact.</br></br>  <br>Alright, so retard confirmed. Learn what the word pretentious means next time, dumbass. And congrats on completely missing the central conflict of the story. You are the naruto audience, as you've completely failed to understand the story.</br>  <br>But it's just a comic book about carrying longboats and killing people, there's nothing to understand!</br>  <br>Second only to Berserk in its genre. Definitely worth checking out. Like Berserk however, it will never be finished.</br>  <br> second only to Berserk in its genre <br>Hmm.</br></br>  <br> genre <br><br>You don't know what that word means, do you?</br></br></br>  <br>I like Vagabond more but the farming arc in Vagabond is way more pretentious than the one in Vinland Saga, even if it was shorter.</br>  <br>Epic philosophical action Seinin genre.</br>  <br> Berserk <br> philosophical </br></br>  <br> joke <br> your head </br></br>  <br>Well it does have that intro in the anime where it says something about free will.</br>  fuck vagabond, I want him to work on REAL  <br>Even having been told there is a joke, I'm still missing it. Explain.</br>  <br>He's pretending to be the original dumb poster who thought Berserk and Vagabond are the same genre.</br>  <br>I concur. Real is too fucking good.</br>  It starts rather awkwardly as a 6/10 manga and then it steadily climbs to 7/10 and 8/10 and 9/10 and eventually a solid 10/10 during the peak of the action but it's followed by a period of peace and it's steadily declining over time. The character progression is good and he feels a lot mature and philosophical but it also means that there is less action, there is less travel, there is less suspense, the main character hardly fights anyone, and if you previously liked the manga for all these things then you're going to feel blueballed.<br><br>Still worth checking out I'd say.</br></br>  Is there anyone else here who has read both the manga and the original novel? Because I think that sometimes when they differed, the manga actually turned out better.  <br><br>nice art but I found the main character and antagonist boring, the side characters used for nothing but brief unfunny comedy relief scenes lame and the fights with random nobodies a chore to get through. <br><br><br>read Shigurui instead op. it has disabled swordsmen that aren't as big of faggots as kojiro.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't say whether Shigurui is better than Vagabond but I can definitely say that anyone interested in a good samurai mango should check out both. They're the best of the genre.</br>  <br><br> Shigurui </br></br>  <br><br>Shigurui is fucking great. It's the first time I've gasped due to the outcome of a fight.<br>It's a shame the whole thing wasn't made as an anime.</br></br></br>  <br>It also made me cringe when people got hurt.</br>  <br>Shigurui has an anime adaptation which is still very good.</br>  For some reason I could only read this while drinking heavly, whisky preferred.<br>Never made it past after the fight with staff-kun in the woods and MC reaches some town with a dojo or something, I dont know, its been a while.<br><br>Did I stop before this so called "peak" or does it continue in its rather slow manner that builds up the good points?</br></br></br>  I'm the only one that liked the Farm arc the most out of the entire manga?  <br>I know.</br>  <br>no, vagabond is literally the most cliche and shonen structured samurai manga i know of (second to ruroni kenshin). its bad, read zamurai or something else. there are so many better samurai mangas.<br><br>i mean, vagabond was alright for a while. but it does fall apart quick when you get to the deaf guy.</br></br></br>  wonder where he got his inspiration from  <br>Second that.

Let's not be silly.</br>  <br>I hate both, but the farming arc in Vagabond were better written. <br><br>Mush growth in mind was realistic, growth takes time, and it doesn´t happen instantly. In Vinland it was almost comedic. I would even put it on par with Canute´s sudden personality change.<br><br>Using k-drama as milestone growth is bad writing. Hence, Vinland is worse. But I hate both, just not a fan of period pieces that´s more fiction than history.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck real, the mc is a doucebag without any redeeming traits. i want a follow up to slam dunk instead.</br>  <br>K-drama?</br>  <br>Shigurui was trying to be way to edgy, is like the mangaka learned the art of emo cutting.</br>  <br>Google?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>if youre in china, just use yahoo.</br>  Matahachi did nothing wrong.

The choices are fantasyland and best corea.</br>  <br>They deserve it too.<br>Good squad.</br></br>  <br>The thing is even though they know they might be on the other side. They don't know where exactly. There is no indication that they are slaves of royality.</br>  <br> fake battles <br>As expected from america</br></br>  <br>There was a bit in the manga IIRC where the emperor warns the Japanese diiplomats something like "there was an empire that prided itself on its military might but it crumbled and was destroyed by outsiders".<br><br>Thus misunderstanding two key points: firstly, that Japan's military isn't all that powerful, and secondly, that Japan's military empire has already collapsed.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You don't cross off people with no confirmed bodies.  The missing Japanese people were taken on previous scouting missions even before the Gate went up. It's in the manga when Noriko was hospitalized. Her family was near the gate distributing flyers of her and her husband, her husband died in the mines, and their house is burned down after a long time of no one in there. </br></br>  <br>And NONE of the JSDF reports on this foreign culture mentioned "they take prisoners as slaves from the people they attack, we should ask them if they took any of ours"?</br>  <br>Maybe ask one of those senators they were buddying up with? Maybe actually bother to investigate, or maybe use their peanut brains to figure out that a culture that obviously practices slavery could have put their citizens in chains and thought nothing of it?<br>Slavery is obviously completely normal to them and they don't have any human rights codes.<br>That forced drama scene really pissed me off.</br></br></br>  <br> we should ask them if they took any of ours <br>They would have probably told them the truth, too.<br>We were shown that they were all surprised that the Nips got so butthurt about slavery.<br> yeah we took your people, so what? </br></br></br></br>  <br>Man i love .50</br>  <br>Those missing people were taken before the Gate went up in Ginza.

Doesn't help that their initial plan was to invade Kyushu using Okinawa as a staging ground, but the Japanese plan was to throw everything they had in a do or die defense of Kyushu.</br></br></br></br>  <br> What is afghanistan <br><br>step it up m8</br></br></br>  <br>+1</br>  <br/>  <br> we want the Idolm@ster audience <br><br>l'm scared to see the monster girls, l bet they were all devolved into cosplay tier now.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He's such a dumb cunt it hurts.</br></br>  <br><br>This would be great if it wasn't shown that the bunny queen is just manipulating him to fuck up the kingdom.</br></br>  <br>Yep they even installed a pretender on the throne of another kingdom.<br>I felt that the way the jap government is acting is similar to the way they did things on the imperial era.<br>Forcing inequal treaties on everyone.</br></br></br>  <br>Fair comparison, considering that she fought alongside Rory.</br>  <br>We get the same here in Australia over whales.

Works gonna deliver again <br><br>They always do. Even if Glasslip just delivered fluffy and a god-tier OST.</br></br></br>  <br>It is. Don't believe those blatant lies.</br>  <br>No wrinkles here.</br>  Characters that deserve death:<br>Charlotte<br>Imouto<br><br>Characters that will probably live:<br>Charlotte</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like this speculation. It's an anime-original work, after all. I'll take a crack at it.<br><br> The student council is actually a group of students that the government is trying to weaponize.  <br> They are placed on the student council to separate them from the rest of the student body so that they can leave class at convenient times to do missions and shit for the government  <br> The brother imouto and MC think they hazily remember isn't actually a brother, it's their sister, charlotte (who is currently disguised as Yumi).  <br> Charlotte has the ability to alter people's memories and outright erase them if she chooses to do so. <br> Alters MC and imouto's memories to forget her when she runs away from the school for super powered people (she was placed on the "student council" too) <br> Charlotte's power is flawed in that she ages backwards for every minute of memories that she alters <br> As such, she never graduates and loses the power because she always has to use it for government jobs which means she is never actually aging. <br> Can't take it anymore and runs away <br><br>and now depressing backstory because muh feels<br> Their parents died when they were little <br> MC always wished he was someone else (because then he'd have parents) <br> Charlotte alters their memories to become their single mother to get them out of their depression. Takes care of them <br> MC still longs to be someone else but doesn't know why, hence that opening scene  <br> Ends up having to leave them and make them harbor animosity towards her as the mother that foisted child custody on their uncle because she could never graduate super power school <br><br> Why is it even semi-plausible that Yumi/Charlotte is actually their sister? <br><br>Imouto and yumi have same ridiculous purple eyes. Their hair is similar (imouto always took after nee-chan, after all) in style/color. Yumi had to do bangs instead of parting it down the middle to hide her identity better. she also dyed it darker to hide her identity better. <br><br>Your turn, /a/nons.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>just realized charlotte is already some blonde chick. disregard that part about yumi being charlotte. yumi is still their sister for the purposes of my speculation though.</br>  <br>fuck off faggot</br>  <br>Elaborate.</br>  <br> best imouto <br><br>What</br></br></br>  <br>Who is this semen vacuum?</br>  <br> semen vacuum <br>I'd play video games (Halo ODST) with, eat ice cream with, play Monopoly with, and maybe cuddle with, but never would I do something so lewd. Maybe even  hold hands with  while we talk about the secrets of the universe.</br></br>  <br>I once saw a screenshot with this green hair making a similar pose like this one; can someone post it?</br>  <br>please respond.</br>  <br>Komachi has a name you fucking pleb.<br><br><br>Nah, i was about to post it but nah. Impatient fuckwit</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sorry</br>  <br>Patience is a virtue. One a lot of people around here should utilize every now and then.</br>  So how many Key anime VA cameos will we get?<br><br>So far we've had Mai Nakahara and Tomoe Tamiyasu.</br></br>  What if something bad happens to imouto?  <br>I think you mean game. Also, it still baffles me how Tomoe voiced Riki, Rin, and Sasasegawa Sasami all at the same time.</br>  <br><br>Here's a bonus since I'm such a nice guy</br></br>  <br>Almost positive something bad will happen to imouto since she is the only decent character in the show.<br>When she dies, the anime will truly become worthless.</br></br>  <br>Was Clannad voiced in the original release?</br>  <br><br>If imouto get hurt, we riot</br></br>  <br> .gif <br>I'll probably end up watching the show and make some proper .webm out of it. How shit is it anyway?</br></br>  <br>It came out in 04, there was a rerelease in 06, and the anime was in 07, so I assume one of the games had voices before the anime.</br>  <br>First season was actually pretty good.</br>  This is now an Oregairu thread.<br><br><br>It's a really well liked show even for the cynics of /a/<br><br>First season was better imo. Second was fine but a bit stale at points. It also leaves you with a cliff hanger as a result of the last couple ln's still being in the writing process.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maeda has not killed major characters in his stories since Little Busters, no idea why faggots still pretend he is some sort of edgemaster like le butcher</br>  <br>Can we please not turn this into another brand of generals? Like what happened to shitters such as </br>  Kinda on the fence with this one. The characters haven't interested me at all. MC is just a faggot with insecurity issues that likes to talk big. Imouto is cute though.  <br> Imouto is cute <br>This is reason enough</br></br>  <br>The MC is basically Kanye, with the same voice actor to boot.</br>  <br>Stop trying to police shit. Let the faggot talk about what he wants.</br>  <br>Look, I'm sorry. I just saw the "New thread" and "edition" in the OP and feared we were already devolving into generals.</br>  <br> This is now an Oregairu thread. <br>No. My thread, you slut. I created this for the discussion of Charlotte &amp; the ever-cheerful &amp; chipper Ayu!</br></br>  <br><br>Don't worry anon, these threads have been pretty descent and anons are polite enough to let the thread reach page 10 before making another unlike yahari threads last season.</br></br>  MC is funny as fuck, I don't get why some of you guys have an issue with him. It's pretty obvious he's going to get a lot of character development.  <br>The imouto is too young to have any powers.<br> a small percent of children manifest super powers upon reaching puberty </br></br>  <br>Of course, Im glad Nao stopped him on his tracks right away. She just saved us from the generic antics of another light/lelouche gary stu.</br>  <br>Funny? In what way, anon?<br><br>People in the last thread were bitching about the MC being "edgy" for cheating in school and manipulating people. Peep the archive if you want a better idea but that's the gist of it. <br><br><br> gary stu  <br>How am I supposed to self insert as a good looking, semi-insane MC with subpar superpowers?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. Fuck that bitch and fuck her derailing my fun plot for some generic magical school bullshit.<br>I would have been fine if it was just him manipulating people with super powers and regular folks trying to catch him in the act, or how he would adjust his powers.<br>But then this bitch comes in and was like "nope, I'm the boss of you and you go to join the xmen"<br>Fuck this show, fuck her, and fuck you.<br>Yes, I'm mad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tell me what you expect from the next episode then, because you likely have the wrong impression.</br>  <br>I liked him too, and I hate Gary Stu characters. Gary Stu and Mary Sue were used to describe super idealized characters without flaws. But it was obvious from the beginning that the anime was painting him as a douchebag, that his hubris is, and evidently was, his downfall.</br>  <br>And it's also called a Tehepero you fucking fag.</br>  <br> not submitting to Nao-sama's will <br>Anon pls. Yu clearly lacks focus and insight, thats why he got caught. Inside the group he will develop and even learn how to use his power more effectively.</br></br>  <br>Go back to watching Death Note edgemaster.</br>  <br>But if she didn't stop him, he would have died of ClannAIDS or something. Now he gets to make lots of friends and watch one or two of them die of ClannAIDS instead.</br>  We're going to see her again, right? They didn't waste time designing her just to give her a minute's worth of screentime, right?  <br>Shut the fuck up already about that fucking bitch you fucking cunt.</br>  <br>Sure thing. This girl will be back too.</br>  This is obviously going to get dark and edgy, could be interesting.<br><br>From the looks of this, this appears to be the consequence of misusing your powers. Seems kind of extreme considering the powers we've seen so far are far too impractical to be used for anything big.</br></br>  <br>When I was in Akihabara and looking at all the advertisements for it, I thought it was a horror anime.</br>  <br>Why, don't you like pathetic main characters?</br>  <br>Looks more to me like the ones with proper and useful powers are taken away to experimentation, or otherwise are experimented on to make the powers stick or be more powerful, kind of like the level 6 program. I think they get anyone who abuses their powers pretty quick.</br>  <br>They shouldn't spoil, in my opinion. Just watching the first episode without looking into it (well I did know the studios involved in it so they are sort of a big hint but that aside) it looks like just looks like comedy chuuni stuff. Would have made a decent "surprise" I guess.<br><br>I really don't want imouto to get hurt. I know she will, though.<br><br><br>That's also certainly a possibility. Otherwise chances are Kanye might have already been hauled off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>delusions<br>Its the same everywhere, you get those who binge on all the material possessions and then you have the few who prepare for the future they want.</br></br>  <br> being this retarded <br>I honestly don't understand why everyone hates the MC. Aside from that stupid maniacal laugh and fake disguise, everything he's done has been pretty understandable. So the guy thinks he's the only one with powers. He is able to cheat his way through school and life in general, and he is physically attractive to boot. Would this not go to your head, anon? Would highschool you not think you were the shit? Then all of the sudden his world gets turned upside down when he gets busted (he loses his confidence in front of Yumi). And to top it all off he's forced to move. That's why he seems like a meek shithead now. Why is that pathetic?</br></br>  <br>People either like absolute betas that they can feel superior to, or powerful self-inserts that get everything they want while being a paragon of virtue.</br>  <br><br><br>God damn these qts.</br></br></br>  Good subs fucking when?  <br><br>Nigga, the protagonists of great fiction aren't great because of how they measure up to the viewer. Great protagonists are great because they are sympathetic characters. Because the audience can identify with them and understand their struggles. That's all that needs to happen. So far I've seen a protaginast who had a nasty reality check (who didn't think, at some point in highschool, that they weren't the shit?) and is struggling to control his surroundings. How the fuck can you not relate to that?</br></br>  <br><br>He's a pittiable douche in many ways, but the part where he stages the accident so he can save the girl was outright selfish and ridiculous. People keep overlooking this when they try an defend him. <br> b-but you would do the same thing too <br>No.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Way to take what I said out of context, friend. I'm talking about him being pathetic. Not about him being a douche. I never said he's a great guy.<br><br>He thinks he's the shit and he wants other people to feel the same way. So he rescues a girl from a speeding truck. Anybody with half a brain wouldn't do something that risky but its a testament to how full of himself he is.</br></br></br>  <br>That has nothing to do with what I'm talking about. What you described is what makes a good protagonist. I'm talking about the sort of people who hate the MC.</br>  <br>And since this is a Key anime, the truck driver probably killed a father of four beautiful children, who are now orphans, and will have to be sold into sex slavery to avoid starving.<br><br>That's right, folks. Kanye is behind all the Japanese Truck killings you've ever seen. He deserves none of your sympathy.</br></br></br>  <br>... so the sort of people who hate the MC don't know what a good protagonist is. That's my point.</br>  <br> QC finishing now. </br>  <br>Mazui?</br>  <br>Fyurie pls go.</br>  <br>This is at least the third time I see someone mentioning Mazui in these threads, what gives?</br>  <br>Right, but you replied and addressed me as though those were my views.<br><br> ... <br>Don't do that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have to post this on every single Charlotte thread?</br>  <br>That happened,he was busted, and he acted pathetic because of that, he wouldn't be pathetic if there was no reason.Was it bad? No, and I will keep watching.</br>  <br>My bad, m8. When you said "people" I thought you were trying to speak for everyone (including yourself, of course). That didn't read like you were only trying to speak for the people that did not like him. <br><br>I did that so that I wouldn't have to start the sentence with "So." It suited my autism at the time. I'll see what I can do.</br></br></br>  I like the MC, at least he isn't a disgusting beta like bell from danmachi  The MC treats women like shit and he's a manipulative arsehole.<br><br>Don't really think I can enjoy this anime.</br></br>  The MC treats women like shit and he's a manipulative arsehole.<br><br>I really think I'm going to enjoy this anime.</br></br>  <br>Do you really think he'll stay that way, anon?

So far its great.   possession power only lasts five seconds <br> "so I can't use it for lewd stuff' <br>MC would have been a real criminal if his power wasn't shit.</br></br>    I'd let her roll roll her hands in front of me if you know what I mean.  Look at this face. Is this the face of evil?  Is this going to be another anime where nobody in the threads refer to the characters by their real names?  Whats this show about?  <br>No. Its just the first episode. No one remembers names in the first episode.</br>  <br>What do you mean? Charlotte is Charlotte.</br>  <br>No one cares about your fun. Go post on your blog.</br>  <br>Too bad the VA of Misuzu (Kawakami Tomoko) won't ever show up.

Basically, only within quotation marks. In addition, they should be used sparingly. The use of ellipses as a sort of pause, as a replacement for another punctuation mark, or within the narration (i.e. out of quotes) is almost always wrong, unless used in a poetic sense. Furthermore, ellipses should never begin a sentence. The valid situations I listed above occur after a word.<br><br>Most importantly, using ellipses incorrectly makes you look like you're 12.</br></br></br>  <br> high and mighty <br>She was extremely nonchalant when she busted the MC for cheating and shit aside from the part about his medical exams where she said that he was lying about being narcoleptic. She could have way more in his face though. If anything, she seems very goal oriented. She did what her school (probably) told her to do. Investigate MC and relocate him if needed. She never said or implied that what he was doing is wrong.</br></br>  Nice.  Wait, KEY is involved? Dropped. It could have been interesting but I now know that it will be garbage no matter how good it will be perceived as being.  <br>NOTHING is wrong WITH ellipses. There IS also nothing WRONG with random CAPITALIZATION to act as IF you're yelling WHEN this is just TEXT. It doesn't EMPHASIZE your point IT just makes YOU look like YOU'RE underaged.</br>  jesus christ why the fuck would CR translate it as Horo-Hero when the fucking name was shown in the episode?  <br>They usually translate the script only.</br>   Rascal! <br>Heh.</br>  <br>Even the slightest bit of research could have easily given them the answer.

It's interesting when someone subverts that by turning their selflessness into a selfish desire like in Kokoro Connect though.</br></br></br>  <br>Also, the dream he had about the missing sibling can't be false because according to Descartes "You cannot have a self-contradictory image in your dreams"</br>  <br> this is what reddit cancer actually believe </br>  <br>It was the MC's monologue in the beginning, he started with Descartes, then ventured off into Kantian phenomenon, and wrapped it up with some Hume-style naturalism and free will.<br><br>As for the ellipses thing... who the fuck cares. It's an indicator of a pause or a tonality or a combination of both, and it really shouldn't get anyone's panties in a bunch so badly that every single instance of it on /a/ gets called out by a dozen "Fuck offs," which are ten times as annoying as the ellipses was to begin with.</br></br></br>  <br> this is what faggots with shit tier taste actually believe </br>  <br>Self-confidence? Did you see how crushed he was after he was dumped? He didn't walk that off at all.

If he wasn't confident, he'd be sitting in a corner calling himself worthless like that faggot from Mirai Nikki. He still thinks he's clever and deserves shit. He'll continue to act in his own interests.</br>  <br>  Did you see how crushed he was after he was dumped? <br>His ego got damaged but recovered quickly, after all he didn't care for the girl that much.</br></br>  <br> trying to fit in <br><br>You just did all the work for me.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, faggot.

My subs fucked with the second one. What subs did you use?<br><br>A cursory Google search doesn't give me shit for that quote. It's also kind of a stretch but interesting nonetheless. <br><br>Cool. Regardless though, I still misused it. <br><br>Just because something didn't happen does not necessarily mean the other did. I could just as easily say that because he didn't have a monologue psyching himself up afterward, he's no longer confident. <br><br>He didn't even notice blondie letting herself into his apartment or whatever because he was still thinking about getting dumped. That's not a quick recovery or a girl that he didn't care about.<br><br>You may have the support of trips but a few posts here saves a shit load elsewhere if I were to do the same thing in a bigger thread.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking pedo. How could u get off to the idea of removing a little girl's clothes and licking her tiny body all over, nibbling her neck and kissing her adorable little nipples? Only a heartless monster would think about her cute girlish mouth and tongue wrapped around a thick cock slick with her saliva, pumping in and out of her mouth until it erupts, the cum more than her little throat can swallow. The idea of thick viscous semen overflowing, dribbling down her chin over her flat chest, her tiny hands scooping it all up and watching her suck it off her fingertips is just horrible. You're all a bunch of sick perverts, thinking of spreading her smooth slender thighs, cock poised at the entrance to her pure, tight, virginal pussy, and thrusting in deep as a whimper escapes her lips which are slippery with cum, while her small body shudders from having her cherry taken in one quick stroke.<br>I am disgusted at how you'd get even more excited as you lean over her, listening to her quickening breath, her girlish moans and gasps while you hasten your strokes, her sweet pants warm and moist on your face and her flat chest, shiny with a sheen of fresh sweat, rising and falling rapidly to meet yours. It is truly nasty how you'd run your hands all over her tiny body while you violate her, feeling her nipples hardening against your tongue as you lick her chest, her neck and her armpits, savoring the scent of her skin and sweat while she trembles from the stimulation and as she reaches her climax, hearing her cry out softly as she has her first orgasm while that cock is buried impossibly deep inside her, pulsing violently as an intense amount of hot cum spurts forth and floods through her freshly-deflowered pussy for the first time, filling her womb only to spill out of her with a sickening squelch. And as you lie atop her flushed body, she sighs breathlessly and her fingers dig into your back as she feels your cock hardening inside her again. Sick fuck.</br></br>  <br>Thank you so much. I was literally going skeletons.exe!<br><br><br>Based Aikatsukin.</br></br></br></br>  <br> All hail lelouche </br>  <br>I feel like Lelouch got reincarned with a new geass everytime I think of the mc.</br>  SHE'S AS COLD AS ICE  <br><br><br>Fuck this meme. The only thing similar about the two characters is that their special power bullshit allows them to compel others to do something (and even then, Lelouche's was way stronger in every way) and both of them have visual cues on the eyes to tell the audience when it's used. Their personality, motivations, and everything else that matters are very different. <br><br>Yes I'm the same guy from the other thread. Prove me wrong.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah she turned cold as fuck in an instant.</br>  <br> Best girl will never win the hentaibowl <br>I don't understand why shows like that exist. What's the point of getting a bunch of cute girls who want the MC's dick when he just chooses the worst one and the rest all suffer?</br></br>  <br>I felt so pissed when that student council bitch ruined everything, hoping she suffers. But I guess he gets to suffer for getting caught</br>  <br>bitch just showed her true colors.</br>  <br>Is this logical thinking?</br>  <br>This, I hope the studio burns.</br>  <br>She was nice to him and took him out for lunch because he just saved her life. Then he ditches her and runs away, and all of a sudden he's acting like they should be together when they barely know each other, because it was part of his plan. Nigga came across as creepy as shit.</br>  Tomori is a bitch  <br>Do you think she makes "home videos"?</br>  <br> wanting P.A. Works to burn <br>I want you to burn.</br></br>  <br><br>This is just my crazy theory but I think her red-haired friend has a power that lets her control minds to some extent, as in making them believe what she says. Yumi didn´t quite realize what happened at the beggining then immedeatly starts lusting for MC's dick, as in begging him to come to eat pancakes. That'd explain her change of personality because red-haired friend's influence faded.</br></br>      <br>I don't know about that, but while I do think Yumi's going to become irrelevant, I'm almost certain Red is going to come back.</br>  <br>Just noticed the Houshinoumi logo in her uniform.

He's controlling the other guy.</br>  <br> Lelouche's was way stronger in every way </br>  <br>my Dad remarried a nip and I can confirm this, and that he's a beta faggot because of it</br>  <br> trying to kill her using glasses-kun <br> Tomori just turns off glasses-kun visual perception until the 5 seconds are over <br><br>Tomori is super effective against Yu, he has zero chance.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Moe as fuck</br>  <br>The last thread had more buttmad people. You might have liked that one more. <br><br>He can't control someone that he can't see and he can't see invisibitch or the teleporting guy if they activate their abilities. He also cabt control more than one person at a time so the chances kf him killing 2 people are slim. Also why would he kill them? That'd be pretty out of character for him.</br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't he just tap into Tomori and make her jump from the building.<br>Surely those 5 seconds will be over before she falls.</br></br>  <br>a bitch heroine and a faggot MC<br>please staph Maeda, please</br></br>  <br>That wasn't confidence. That was an ego.<br>The MC strikes me as cowardly and weak person, and that's before the student council showed up.</br></br>  <br>When?</br>  How many commercial trucks have been SUPPORTING CHARACTERS in anime so far?  <br>When he was in the student council room retaking his exam? That wouldn't be a very far fall. The pavement is pretty much horizontal from the window's view.</br>  <br>I meant from his new house</br>  <br>It'd be a little late to murder them at that point, anon. His secret was already out.</br>  Is there going to be incest in this?  How old is imouto?  <br>Then maybe in the lake?<br>Could he possibly make her drown in 5 seconds?</br></br>  <br> Key <br>What do you think?</br></br>  <br>old enough.</br>  <br>Is that a no or a yes?</br>  <br>Not unless he conveniently already had a ton of cinder blocks tied to some netting laid out on some dock that he could roll her up in and jump into the lake with, all in 5 seconds.<br><br>And last I checked he didn't plan on skydiving into that lake with glasses kun.</br></br></br>  Best girl.  I want to beat her up, rape her and then steal her camcorder.  <br> not stealing the camcorder then filming you fuck her <br>You had one job.</br></br>  <br><br>I like your theory.</br></br>  <br>He can control the dude and kill the invisible chick. It's not like they have their habilitied activated all the time</br>  <br>The invisible chick can then make herself invisible to the dude and kill him.</br>  <br>Did she came from Air?</br>  <br>Alright how about this, get a gun into the hand of the teleport dude, take his body over, shoot Sue Storm in the fucking face, toss gun back to self just in time to pick it up and shoot teleporting dude as he's briefly stunned by the sight of the chick with the top of her head blown off.</br>  The exam didn't even seem to be mathematical.<br>Did he not even look at the questions he answered?</br>  <br>Yeah that was a total scrub move, if you take an exam once and learn the answer to every single question, you should really be able to do it again without cheating and at least get a 90.</br>  <br>Good luck shooting someone you can't see.</br>  <br> shoot Sue Storm in the fucking face <br>How? She already became invisible</br></br>  <br><br>But if she made herself invisible to MC, he would be able to see her from teleporter dude's body, wouldn't he?</br></br>  <br>We'll see. If her power targets the "soul" rather than a physical body, then even if MC were to keep switching he wouldn't see her. In this episode, for example, he hadn't seen her before she revealed herself to him despite him switching with other people in the same room as her.</br>  Just watched the first episode and holy shit was that first have up to Nao's introduction fantastic. MC was a smug Kanye and a complete piece of shit. I loved it.<br><br>Second half with the changing of schools was kind of a bummer, overall this starter episode was a perfect hook.<br><br>MC needs to stay a smug bastard until the end or I will wind up very disappointed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope we get a good balance of the MC being a smug little shit and messing with people and him falling on his ass and getting slapped around by the other people in the school council.</br>  <br>That's a good point, I forgot he didn't see her when he took over the seitokaicho's body. That must be how it works then, unless he was really just that distracted by the porn he was holding.</br>  <br>It's been this way for a LONG time.</br>  <br>I have to wonder why /a/ keeps going back to anime that has the same themes. It's like women who constantly get into relationships with guys who drink a lot and beat them. You would think "we" would learn our lesson eventually, but we keep coming back to the same ol' same old shit.<br><br>Moefags didn't ruin the industry, it was people who kept giving the illusion that it was popular. People who wanted more quirky grills in their Chinese cartoons. People in general.</br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty funny that "school" is a genre. I can't really think of any other medium where you'll find that as a genre tag in like half the entries in that medium.</br>  <br>She's already imouto of the season. Maybe even loli of the season too.<br><br>Also, her third person speech is moe as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>If you think about it, it makes a lot of sense for Japan to have "school" be a genre. That's half their life, doing shit in school for university. Going through hell of exams, just to be another number in a box designed to be just as bad as school. Dogs and Demons is an excellent book, but it puts it all into perspective what kind of messed up culture Japan has.

I believe the crunchy subs for Zenkoku used dead wall draw.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Most mangaka don't give a fuck or two when their work goes overseas. In fact, when I went to Singapore, it had a slew of chinese translated titles that are not licensed yet in the west, Saki included.</br>  Reminder that YP is managed by Daiz's subordinates in order to crackdown LN translators and kill BT  <br>First Toki and now he plans to assassinate Saki? <br>Daiz has gone too far this time.</br></br>  <br>This is actually a good question.<br>And the answer might really be <br><br>Or perhaps Ritz will surprise us by going "i never said they had to play each other in order to meet"</br></br></br></br>  <br> In fact, when I went to Singapore, it had a slew of chinese translated titles that are not licensed yet in the west, Saki included. <br>This doesn't prove that "Most mangaka don't give a fuck or two when their work goes overseas." is true though.</br></br>  It's like they're sabotaging the project on purpose so it bombs and they can keep shitting out more Fate garbage.

Is this shit supposed to get good soon?<br><br>Botan-chan a  cute  though.</br></br>  Season 1 is awful, season 2 is great, season 3 is pretty good, season 4 is okay. I think you should at least finish season 2 before you give up.  So are Kurama and Shuichi separate personalities or one and the same? In some episodes it seems they're separate minds but most of the time it seems to be just one single personality though.  EP 29 here. <br>I heard after the dark tournament is should have been the ending spot for the series. Is this arc really long? What could they fill it out with?<br>Since its a 112ep series.</br></br>  <br>They're the same. I believe.</br>  I just finished the Chapter Black arc and I think that they've only been getting progressively better<br><br>I haven't heard that many good things about the last arc though so my expectations aren't very high</br></br></blockquote>]
