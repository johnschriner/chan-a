[ While we wait for the movie, post semen demons. I'll start.     Good taste there    What can I say, I have a taste for girls who are a bit... Eccentric so to speak.   Anybody have the Kay fanfic that end with something like "even though she's a back back buttslut, she's still a good Christian girl who loves her Jesus"?   A bit old for me, but to each their own   Age is of little concern for me.   You have good taste.    Posting a demon constantly enveloped in semen.    Thank you kind sir   Post more semen demons    Happy Brithday Saori!         Wait, is that a giant dick in that picture?    No, that's Shizuka's face.    Hana looks delicious in that picture.      so fluffy. i want to  rustle her hair     Uploaded RR26 and Maginot 7 part 1.  https://mega.co.nz/#!aRQlmT6D!0gyf-<wbr>ZDyFmPHqI0Jwr8gDW2Obste5QmN4WnnGWGh<wbr>hRY</wbr></wbr>   https://mega.co.nz/#!yMZW2ZpB!O0IHQ<wbr>_xVYA3yVNTRFrxahGGoT4hN4h_st1vZE1k7<wbr>U0g</wbr></wbr>           Poi?     classy   Nogami shared on Twitter a page he working on for an upcoming RW chapter. I wonder who is the girl eating at the bottom left of the page.   I have this, which is close enough.   Happy birthday Saori!  there's also a new 14 sec PV for the Gate anime. Looks like at least Piña's design didn't get butchered: https://<span>youtu.be/SSC7z4bP3J8  [ ]   neat, gonna dump Maginot later I guess   I'd spontaneously say it's someone from Ooarai           Full cover scan anywhere?    I also fixed a typo on RR 24 page 4-5, but the wiki's editor hasn't been cooperating so I haven't been able to update it there.  https://mega.co.nz/#!nVZVSIbQ!ShONx<wbr>jlaDBw3JzoCmMIyBfJTvH8Icz5r0rTCnfKJ<wbr>2G4</wbr></wbr>      who would wear a one piece in Ooarai? i would like to think it's yukari but hair is not fluff enough    it's  miho, or momo, or caesar      neat, gonna dump Maginot later I guess  So we'll be (correct me if I'm wrong, please): MLLSD: Current RW: one chapter behind Maginot: Current LA2: 2 chapters behid  Total of 3 chapters behind in 4 series. Considering we once were over 15 chapters behind betwen GuP manga and MLLSD, not bad. Not half bad.           Nope, maginot chapter 8 is out already. Speaking of, I've ripped the raws and put them here:  https://mega.co.nz/#!jYIHUDJI!i12Cu<wbr>PvTDJITbdVlbVi7GFqYKwVExk4yQpWvfIhv<wbr>d4M</wbr></wbr>      I was first thinking Miho, but the hair seems too long in her back. So maybe Karina or Saki?   Maginot is one behind again now that 8 is out.  Also I'm letting further translations wait till typesetting has caught up to give TS anon less backlog pressure btw.          Nope, maginot chapter 8 is out already.  wasn't Maginot 7 part 2 already translated?  Also, typesetting pressure is overrated; I can choose not to be a lazy ass and read from raws and scripts.         here  Also I'm letting further translations wait till typesetting has caught up to give TS anon less backlog pressure btw.  Oh. You mean dump RAWS. I yhought you meant you were gonna dump a TL. Gomen. It makes sense now.      Well, to add, Comic Alive will be out this Saturday in Japan so we'll be 1 chapter behind RR and 3 chapters behind LA2.   I meant actual chapter 8. Unless you count having the current chapter untranslated, but not being behind on previous chapters, as current.  And just typesetting would be one thing, but I also do leveling, cropping, cleaning, and redraws on top of it, up to and including recreating massive inter-page gaps and large areas of complex art under text from scratch.    I'm pretty sure he meant he'd dump 7 part 1, which has just been typeset but hasn't been dumped in a thread yet. I guess we'll find out which one he actually meant when it starts.        And its current state.    The cleaning of the arm and bow is almost seamless, but the ground lines still could use some work. We've seen you do trul amazing redraws, so surely the end result will be amazing.    When will Photoshop's content fill algorithm finally be smart enough to do this automatically?    It's not done yet, of course. The lines like that are the hardest part because if the texture is off by the tiniest amount it's really noticeable where the gap is.   It's unlikely it'll ever be, since those algorithms are designed for photographs, not drawings.      all right, let's do this                                     done     trusting algorithms instead of doing it by hand  Surely you'll want to play senshado with computer sights instead of old-fashioned opticals, too?     Computer sights, automatic loader, automatic transmission, and digital camo. Wipe the floor with those ancient tanks.   For the Anon who asked about GuP wargames on eor two threads ago  catch it before it 404s      automatic loader     So is functionality, apparently.   http://ww2live.com/en/content/world<wbr>-war-2-be-one-few-and-become-owner-<wbr>t-3476-and-su-100  T-34-76   "tiger-killer"   it's clearly a T-34-85   $44,531   fresh coat of paint for an extra fee  top kek      </wbr></wbr>    Serpentine! https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=A2_<wbr>w-QCWpS0</wbr>  [ ]     You monster.

That's why I use zigzag instead      I'd bet Saori'd take a trip to Mexico.    OVER THE LINE!    She'd scare off all the guys trying to impress them with her tank.     tfw even Mexicans don't want to fuck saori     is it ok if I have the  game  engine running?    Is it just me, or is the bow's string on the wrong side of her arm?    FER DA EMPURA!    either a design choice, like the frames of glasses becoming invisible if they'd cover the eyes Or Nogami just Nogami'd again     wait, i know that "loader stronk" thing.. but throwing around a Maiale?  Also, dem pepperonis.       Another team leader with Blonde hair.       European archer here  It's actually how the Japanese bow works - that and the pointing finger. The drawing position, loose grip and firing technique make the bow to turn around upon firing, so the string ends up in the other side.  One of th ereasons I know is because I'm tired of mangakas Nogami-ing and incorrectly depicting Western bows BEING USED THAT WAY.         Maiale  Inflatable one. They're in the beach, doofus.       oh, didn't know that detail although I did a bit of archery once as well. Superintendent of my middle school used to be national champion in it     Because you silly riflefags forget real men don't need gunpowder to be /k/ as fuck  inb4 "Momo isn't a ream lam"      Looking back at previous chapters confirms this. How do they realign the bow for the next shot then?      &gt;lam   *man   Touch typing fuck-up       Twist it back again in place, doh!   what does /gup/ think about this plump, mature crossbreed offspring of a german/french relationship containing domestic violence?  looks pretty desperate to me       That sounds awkward and slow. Won't preventing the bow from turning in the first place increase their rate of fire?    but it worked, that's what's important.    The time needed to twist it again in place (a fraction of a second) is insignificant in comparison to the many seconds of time it takes to draw a new arrow, nock it in the string, ready the bow, aim and loose.  As if it actually helps aim (the main function of the "loose grip, pointed finger" tech of the Japanese), well, it works. So does the European way. So does the Mogol one (also different). All them do work - different places, different techniques, but they all get the job done.              Why Tank?    Where do you think you are?    Katyusha best girl confirmed      Why is Rapeface-chan still mislabeled?     the Mogol one   ?      I think he meant mongol.   Anyone more knowledgeable about tanks than me know what the jellyfish is supposed to be? Is it some Korean meme?   Torturing aliens for their advanced technology    He looks pretty happy       best girl   Is this really it?         that's pretty cool     Sweet.    https://<span>youtu.be/fs81TTSMIFk  [ ]    tanks    So fun to use in the Battlestations games.    All of my monies         but the wiki's editor hasn't been cooperating  Are you getting that message about mega links triggering the spam filter?     I want to marry Shizuka and make babies with her and  hold her hand       Asparagus in Edvard Munch style?

Fuck them   These two better be in the movie or we riot      Katyusha is confirmed for the movie.    Lesbian shenanigans are absolutely forbidden    Just be satisfied they are cameo-ed and then OVA announcement.    They're not lesbians they're just good friends.     sherman  good taste, but not good as  TOGII.      So, you want a movie without Miho, Yukari, Mako and Sodoko...   I some times wonder how these threads would looks like if it have actual GuP character discusing/arguing their favorite tanks.   arguing their favorite tanks.   You're probably new if you haven't seen it in every GuP thread here on /a/..     Just replace standard waifu fighting from other threads on board with tanks and trow some /pol/ faggotry..    Did you not read what I wrote?  I fucking said TWO of them or we RIOT!      Two Katyushas?    If Katyusha is in the movie then Nonna is not far behind.    Pls no    But gulag-chan is in the movie.    How about 2 katyushas vying for the attention of 1 Nonna?    I'd rather see two Nonnas fight over one Katyusha    exactly, tovarish anon   Would you a boyish Katyusha?   Eh, you know...   http://www.tinami.com/view/779710   I'll take eight!    that's not how additional armor works...      Infantery protection?   I always wonder what volleyball team smokes in this guys doujins...     Schurzen.   I was never interested in GuP, but that damn Samurai Girl got me so damn interested in it. I love her character. Is there more of her expect the manga?    gulag-chan     Watch the original dum dum.    Shizuka is a new GuP character not yet appeared in anime.     damn x 2   expect the manga  You might want to read a different manga. Ribbon Warrior has too many of them dificult words.      Is that BC Freedom uniform color canon?    see  and notice their pic is not fanart      Wtb Jaikas    It looks like it since it was one of the different collectibles(pic related) included when you buy Vol. 2 in different stores.      well, Ribbon warrior takes part after the events in GUP happened, so the only part Shizuka could play in the main manga would be that of a spectator.    Always good to see fresh art of her     Put those two and Shizuka in one room, what will happen?   They either end up murdering Shizuka or idolizing her.    Shizuka rapes them both.    Not murdering.  More like claiming her head in a honourable duel.      wooden  This one here even explodes.          KAAAAAHHHHHN    Duck tank can be used in Ribbon Warrior thing? It's light enough?   what was the limit? 10 tons?  If so, The Type 89 is too heavy.It's 12,7 to 13 tons, depending on the model.      12,7 tons   You Europeans are so adorable.     So no Orai team in this.   I kinda wish Hippo team get some light tank to face Centipede.        Turtle teams 38(t) on the other hand qualifies. Just needs to downgrade back from the Hetzer.      The 38(t) would have been light enough.   I like cute girls doing cute things and I like tanks. Will I enjoy this show?   Yes    Yes.   Bump      lend &amp; lease  every time     It's just moeshit, as you can see   RW is the best thing ever.  And I'm saying this as a person who thinks feetfags are worse than Hitler.      who /fluffy/ here?     ok swiss momo you win i'll fap to your body, i dont mind anymore       The true semen demon.     This is your thready reminder that T-54 is Senshado legal.   My heart hurts.  My dick hurts.      Technically that's nbot a T-54, but a T-44-100 prototype     My god that navel...  Where's this from if you don't mind? Kinda new to GuP, only seen series and an OVA so far.    has tank corner 6 been subbed yet?   no even though yet another Anon offered to maybe do it.     I wish /ak/ were more accepting of modern technology instead of clinging on to their old and outdated tanks.       It upsets me that some of the best-depicted modern warfighting equipment in anime served no purpose but to get rekt by a pmsing kraut teenager in Evangelion  I hope Gate manages to be tolerable enough to soothe my autism         What about futuristic tech?  Also new tech wasn't used in any big war, so it have less war charm than WWII tech.       I don't think Miho produces semen     Spider tanks. When will Boston Dynamics announce plans to attach railguns on their extra big BigDog?    Whenever we get batteries and capacitors that don't have shit energy density.    It won't be     Ch 8 of armored highschool is done  For you planefags, after this its going to be flight highschool ch 29 which is where the other translator left off.  Should be easier.           I will upload ch 7 as well, the rest can be found on the /ak/ wiki.    also anyan's comment for ch 8: "if i make a 4koma every time they discover a flaw in the arjun, i’m gonna have a lotta comics"          Putin poster on the wall  What would a boyband made up of Russian/Soviet leaders look like?     and just realized I missed a balloon of ellipses    It's one of the recent GuP posters from one of the anime magazines releassd in Japan.

Well, looks like Mako will be on the nexl volume.       2 per volume, Anon. Who'll be with Mako in vol 3? Saki?       Who'll be with Mako in vol 3?  The author might move on to group shots after the main cast. My bets on Turtle team.      So maybe Anzu with Mako, then Yuzu and Momo together after that.      it's Rin we're talking about  Obvious answer  Sodoko.        WW2  BORRRRRRING Cold War or bust     show me what you got!        i miss her ;_;      obligatory            Speaking of gintama, why is todays episode airing early?       Wait, what? Is airing early? Now tell me that the manga chapter is tomorrow and you'll make my day    I'll know in about an hour if this is correct or not, hope the thread lasts    Thank you anon    Don't worry, i won't let this thread die        muh waifu    Tsukki a cute, a best girl   Good taste anon        rare never seen before               I feel like a dumbass because I always forget what episode that is from      The episode where Hijikata gets ocd from Buddha and Kondo gets his dick stuck in a urinal hole     The one where he gets his dick stuck while peeing      Joseph scarf and Caesar pose   Has a stand without a stand arrow.   Gin is way too op       Yeah I can just never remember the episode number     under rated episode    113      That shit killed me   Come on new ep   H-hes going to be alright, r-right? Everything is going to be daijoubu, right? Right?    Shh... It's just red mayonnaise    Thank you anon, now the thread will die    Katsura ja nai, ill Smith da    just as daijoubu as  the shogun     Shouldn't katsura become ill Smith in the second movie?    He's going to wake up and beat the shit out of the Tendou with a bad-ass new scar in his face   Right? ;_;        We can't let this Thread die    C-Course he will anon... of course he will, the he'll marry Otae and raise a family, just like he wanted... He just needs to sleep for a bit so let's let him be for a while.     <br/>   I swear to God if he doesn't stand up...       my body is ready  When is new chapter coming out?   At the usual time.   Oh fuck you animegg for getting my hopes up   What happened?   It didn't drop but it was a nice dream   R-right, Hijikata shouldn't push his mayo-addict to his fellow comrade. Pict unrelated.    Please don't die    It airs at the usual time today     What happen to the shogun?                        I love this arc    Oh god my fucking heart    When the night has come and the land is dark and the moon is the only light we'll see.          DONDAKE     Probably going to get shit on for asking this but I'm sure there are some tumblr using anons. Does anybody know if those cows are butthurt about Hijikata being a fat pig of a creature?       tbh im really unhappy that the anime thought it was OK to air something like that in 2015, but this is the same series that makes light of transgenders and genderfluid people so i dunno what i was even expecting tbh.   hopefully the series/ Hideachi will grow up out of these dated, backwards as hell views on queer folk        Please tell me you grabbed this from tumblr and didn't write it yourself. Please.           Being butthurt about comedy    Hot off the .webm presses.    The arc will end today  Fun times, the only time Gintama got numerous threads that hit bump limit continuously       Reaction image thread <br/>   no   7 minutes   meizhi      I still dont get this joke   it's time  yamazaki's voice makes me feel things    DAT GORILLA  next week is the bento chapter. I don't know how they're going to fill up an episode with only one chapter   Tsukky dissapointed by size of your dick   Where can I find the OST of the new season ? I really like the track played when Dekkobokofags appear       responding to obvious bait       I can hear the trumpets.    Only one chapter? They didn't learn their lesson did they  Also no one screenshot the stream?      [HorribleSubs] Gintama - 277 [720p].mkv   It's out!                 he should just go to shugo for that.          He's Ginsexual            would let her abuse me all day.   A new OP as well? But it's only been one cour        And next week   chapter 443      Holy shit why is she so perfect   Only one chapter? They're going to stretch it again so bad How many episode they're gonna do anyway?        No idea numbers of episodes   Infinite I hope       Making Hijikata keep the same voice was the best part of this arc   something I never understood in gintama. why are courtesans so respected in this society? aren't they common whores? what's with the power they give them and their bastard kids?  I like gintama but this part was weird from the beginning and it is starting to appal me.     Must be horrible to be as retarded as you.    Maybe they'll do some omake related to the new op/ed to take up the extra time.    I hope so, the jokes would feel slow and redundant if they do one chapter per episode  Just look at Timestop arc      Yeah, the pacing for the first two episodes felt too slow. And they already added the whole conference thing.   About the new OP  Can we expect clues for future arcs?   Afuro at least?        Hopefully the excaliburs will appear in this OP.    No chance he'll be dead. Isaburo is not going to leave this arc alive though.   Next week, Hinowa teasing Tsukuyo about Gin.   I kinda want Isaburo to die so Nobume will go full edge like Kagura did    Love Potion Arc when?    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geish<wbr>a, there's also a film about it.</wbr>    Geisha aren't prostitutes though (though some did do it). What you're thinking of are oiran, high-class prostitutes and entertainers. They aren't just supposed to sleep with the customers, but also serve drinks, converse, dance, sing, and so on.    Will probably still take a while. Love Potion arc was actually one of the more recent arcs. It's just the latest two serious arcs have been very long.  Then again, the anime is jumping all over the place in adapting the chapters, but since it is the last we've seen of Tsukuyo since then, I don't we'll get it until just before the Shogun Assassination arc.      That arc was horrible though.    They still haven't adapted the Shachi chapter that they skipped last season.    It has some nice action scenes though Hopefully Bamco will deliver     He lived happily ever after    At least it's better than the Shinigami arc. The Shogun amnesia arc is the best one.   I'm spotting quite a few different screenshots that I've posted and other people have downloaded, its great!  Ginko is  lewd   Anyone else feeling like this season just isn't up to scruff yet? I'm considering taking a break for a bit so I can marathon a bunch of episodes, since I haven't enjoyed this season as much as I did the last two. I'm thinking marathoning it like I did them will make me a little bit more blind to the flaws, and mediocre episodes won't stand out as much.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Crb<wbr>IsLltsmE</wbr>  [ ]    Not really. Most of the episodes aside for the ninja episode and the New 4 Devas meeting episode have been enjoyable.  I even consider the lottery episode to be among top 10 best Gintama episode in general.     He went back to being Shigeshige Just Shigeshige     and now everything is daijoubu  ;_;     it will never be daijobu again anon    I'm still in denial    I am still waiting for the amnesia arc. I was expecting it to be animated by now.   Shimura Tae the cutest!   Tae is cute, but Tsukuyo is best,     Agreed!     Can't wait for that arc either     OTAE A SHIT!     No idea, but I can wait for it if we get this arc before that.    They'll probably do that one together with the other one where they got all the assistants.      Shit.      S.h.i.t.    How can you look at that smile and still say that? You might not like her at other times but that smile is extremely heart-warming.   Yamazaki should have stayed a woman. She is too cute   Generic bitch that sucks the fun out of any scene she is in. Her angry girl gorilla comedy was never funny.    Literally every girl in Gintama is violent and bitchy. Well except Tama but she's not a girl she's a tool for masturbation.     You have to admit that smile is cute though.    But every other girl has more depth are atleast another gag. Otate is simply shinpachi's mongoloid sister that is lusted after by Gorrilla and one eye'd cunt.    Its not.       But Tama attempts to kill Gintoki with her fire breathing mop. And Kagura isn't bitchy, she's just dumb.     getting this mad over a side character     Otae wants to revive his father's dojo and that's why she's working at a cabaret club. Gorilla-sensei dropped that plotline ages ago because it was too bothersome but it's there.   Kagura is like a female Gintoki, she's lazy and bitchy. I love her, but come on.          Side character  Nigger she gets shoe horned into the series all the time unless the trio goes to space or something.    Still a cunt.         Kagura   not bitchy  She's like a female mix between Okita and Gintoki      stay mad    Oh I will.    She doesn't get any more screentime than the rest of secondary characters.    Its more about you can't marathon it, before you watched all episodes in a row and didn't lose the line of things, with 1 episode per week you kinda lose the emotion of the previous one    She's lovely, and a bro   I also find Tae rather generic and not all too interesting. She could be better though. Especially if she actually DID something in the more serious arcs.  It's funny how the best girl of the series isn't even a human being   Yes  Kagura is the best        Not even best Yato.      Yes  Mutsu is the best        If you say Kamui, I'm going to be disappointed in you       Kamui   not Mutsu                                     Mutsu   not the OG Yato                                Tsukki is stealing Sacchan's character and looking good while at it.      why are you doing this?      Best or worst wingman?    Why am I what?          spamming pics it's unhealthy for discussions          Gintama Reaction Thread   spamming pics      It's a shit thread.        I like it.       why is he spamming pics in a reaction thread  why indeed     Then go start one for the episode you retarded shit      We're already using this one for that, no need to create another one.      We've already used the thread for discussions, might as well continue. Better than starting a new thread that'll die quickly.       Don't mind me then, discuss away. Just so you know, this isn't just one person posting, half of these aren't mine.     <br/>     She does though. Nobody can beat the Shinsengumi screentime though. If anybody eats up screentime, it's them.    Gintama is south park for anime fans   What is Kumiko saying to Shu1?    i also masturbated to you before    She admitting that she will never get the part down.   That's actually Reina talking to Shu1 in that shot.   In the name of St. Kaori.   I'm a gay homosexual lesbian and Reina is my girlfriend    Died for all our  Reina's  sins    tfw can't sleep because Midori is just too cute.   Send help    Nothing. Reina caught Shuichi talking shit about Taki Sensei, and Kumiko is now looking at her.     The patron saint of talentless hacks.      She's my favourite background character.  Praise kyoani for cute background waifus.      umaku naritai     When does it get good, you faggots lied to me    Have all of you taken your daily time to thanks KyoAni?   She deserves more screen time.     You guys must be fun at parties.     Show me your bussy    I'll fight you fagott.      I wish the anime went over the reason why she considered backing Kaori in the audition. Both she and Hazuki are given such little screentime as it is, it's unfortunate when good scenes that they do have get cut.  But maybe KyoAni's just saving the scene for something else.     Don't talk about Taki-Sensei in front of the crazy bitch, she almost killed me last time I did.   I want to be almost killed by Reina.    Hey, did you know Satoshi saw your dick?     At this point im wondering what her purpose even is. What does she and Hazuki do in the later novels?    realisticfag gtfo pls    Can you blame him? He was  __gay__.      I wish the anime went over the reason why she considered backing Kaori in the audition.  But they did. Are you actually watching the show?     Being the closest case with the hopeless crush on a superior specimen who couldn't care less is suffering.    Praise the potato    Why does Kyoani like to bully gays so much?     Which Hibike have you masturbated to?    spreading gossip about sensei and senpai  Typical band faggot.    It's over /u/ status: destroyed. Now they're just pathetically wishing for an open-ended end and that Kumiko won't show hints that she likes him next episode.    Goto.    Competition piece: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8Tt<wbr>lMmSLJcU</wbr>  [ ]  What do you think /a/?       All dem neets fapping to their shitty oboe waifu   Smh    Like poetry   Flat ass.

I'm honestly bewildered by these comments.    /u/ is awful.    Why? All of those posts are accurate.    After seeing how Reina acted towards Kumiko when she heard she was alone with Taki-Sensei, you would have to be completely insane to believe she has any romantic interest in anyone besides Taki-Sensei.  Even if they made a yuri bait scene ten times as pandering as the episode 11 one, it still won't mean even an "open end", since the only way they could make it more clear that Reina wants Taki D is by having her fuck table-kun while looking at a picture of Taki-Sensei.      I should have waited for next week. MIDI is just so awful it doesn't do justice to actual playing. I think it will be great though.    Reina.    You misunderstood that scene. Reina was actually jealous that Kumiko was alone with a man at night.  Based KyoAni knows how to keep the bait ambiguous, just like Reina's weird face in episode 5.      Why must all threads be like this? Can you just appreciate a nice pair? I'm not even a yuri-fag but Reniaxkumiko is cute, and honesty it would of been fine if it went childhood friend route,   But God damn, just enjoy it, you can't look anyone in the eye and honestly claim yuri-bait after episode 11       Sorry, I refuse to believe these are genuine opinions of rational people.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Pcn<wbr>BIGMRdHs</wbr>  [ ]   That looks quite tasty.   I'm going to marry Kumiko!     What's the point of those shows?    Of course you are, Reina.    I'm going to marry Natsuki!        Shuichi's worst nightmare. Or maybe his dream, I don't know.    How can it be his if she's only had sex with Reina?    Reina never acted jealous over Kumiko. She sperged out several times when Taki-Sensei was mentioned. She only freaked out after she heard Taki's name mentioned. There was nothing ambigous here.   Episode 11 scene was explained as a continuation of episode 8 banter a billion times already. Look at how Kumiko and Reina acted in these past five episodes outside of those scenes. They acted as friends. Kumiko was weirded out by Reina's confession for Taki, not jealous or heartbroken. If ep11 was Kumiko returning Reina's love, why did they act as friends and not partners in episode 12?       Because it gets annoying to hear people repeatedly claim Kyoani will purposely change the pairing in an adaptation. Never mind the fact that the current volume has zero romantic development, never mind that Kyoani has been very faithful in their adaptations, never mind that changing the pairing while still only on volume 1 of 4 is momentally stupid, it just gets annoying when the only reason anyone actually wants the lesbian pairing isn't because it's progressive or part of their character development, but because they just want to see two girls getting it on.    I mean the reason about what she realized in middle school. Did you actually finish reading my post?     Get good you fucking scrub.    Again, you misunderstood. Reina freaked out because she didn't want Kumiko to be with a man. She had the same reaction in episodes 5 and 8 (regarding Shuuichi in the latter).  Her "rabu" is actually just admiration for Taki-sensei, and her "ai no kokuhaku" is true homosexual love for Kumiko. Also, partners do act like friends, they aren't lovey-dovey all the time.  All of this was planned out very carefully by KyoAni. They'll bait everyone until the end, and they'll never make another season or movie.         would of   Learn2english       Kyoani has been very faithful in their adaptations  Heh. Also Anon, have you read the novels, or at least the one this season is based on? Because I imagine it would help you form your opinion on this matter.   but because they just want to see two girls getting it on.  When has this been the case ever?          this level of desperate /u/ damage control   Keep 'em coming, just keep 'em coming     I love the track at 4:03, what's the title called?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?t=11&amp;<wbr>v=YHYWAXFvs0Q</wbr>  [ ]  Also, slightly pressured Red Ribbons is also good.      So does the /u/ camp of /a/ have it this crazy compared to other places? I'm tempted to peek at other forums to see how they feel about the yuri teasing in it all.  Fuck it. Let's see what I can find.      you can't look anyone in the eye and honestly claim yuri-bait after episode 11   I'm not even a yuri-fag  Stop lying and fuck off        No versions of playing bad    FUCKING KYOANI YOU BETTER GIVE ME A S2/MOVIE OR ELSE I'LL FUCKING KILL MYSELF I'M FUCKING SERIOUS HERE   Damn you are hairy.    Other forums pretty much unanimously support the yuri. Only /a/ has these unruly hetfags, perhaps because they spill over from the SJW backlash on /v/.    That fig is so shitty   Which section would you join and why?   How can you wear those fucking dirty shoes? Are you literally poor or 16 years old?     Wearing shoes inside the house  Pls.     Hibike yurifags are far more dominant in other forums, since it's seen as "progressive" to demand a lesbian pairing in the name of "queer representation" and all that jazz. Anybody who disagrees too vehemently can be easily bludgeoned into submission and/or silence by accusations of homophobia. Basically, if you want a straight pairing and visit any other forum, you just don't dare to speak up for fear of social repercussions. /a/ doesn't have this problem, of course, since everybody is anonymous, can say whatever he likes and generally doesn't give a shit about other people. Which is why /a/ is and always has been superior to other forums, no matter how much shitflinging goes on around here.    Reina is actually yelling at Shoe1 for talking about Taki-sensei.  Here's the full image.      Double reeds. I'd slowly come between Kurumi and the other fagott until after graduation at which point Kurumi and I would go to the same college and right fagott would be forgotten forever.     Wanna make "music together" with Reina and me?     Do you also go into the basement to laugh?    yeah good try, but it's easy to see your pic is photoshopped  just compare shuuichi's mouth to the one in OP's image      /u/fags are hilarious    THIS IS NO JOKE     6 days until this.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rBM<wbr>E62reb5Y#t=54</wbr>  [ ]    Is Drills-chanXTromboner-kun the best kyoani romance ever?

You beast. That would never, ever happen.    Euphoric!    Why is Taki there? What are you thinking sensei?    What else would one call the people wanting yuri to lose?    What am I looking at?    I know I'm probably a moron for taking this post seriously, but it's not like I have anything better to do. And some people do seem to believe this.   Reina freaked out because she didn't want Kumiko to be with a man.   She freaked out specifically after hearing Taki-Sensei's name, and started ignoring everything Kumiko was babbling about. It wasn't the man part, or the alone part, it was Taki part. She has never shown a reaction this serious towards anything non-Taki related. Compare all the other reactions Reina had towards people talking about Taki-Sensei.   She had the same reaction in episodes 5 and 8 (regarding Shuuichi in the latter).  Episode 5 scene was, again, about Taki-Sensei. Smiling about Shuichi in episode 8 was indicative of her sharing the same opinion Hazuki does - that Kumiko is in love with Shuichi and in denial of her feelings. They've known each other since middle school, after all.   Her "rabu" is actually just admiration for Taki-sensei, and her "ai no kokuhaku" is true homosexual love for Kumiko.  "Ai no kokuhaku" line is straight from the novels. Where they're platonic friends. It's just chuuni talk. The idea that rabu was just admiration is nonsensical, she literally pointed out and clarified her stance. She is in romantic love with him. If it was just admiration, it would not have been done this way.   Also, partners do act like friends, they aren't lovey-dovey all the time.  They weren't lovey-dovey even once. They weren't lovey-dovey in private, when there was no one around them. They acted just as friends. And this was shortly after they supposedly confessed to each other. There would have been a lot more nervousness and romantic tension - and there was literally none. You don't act like friends when you're all alone with your first teenage love the very next day after you confess to each other. Even their private talk was one-upmanship - if you become special I'll become even more special. No mention of being special together.                Two beautiful 18 year old girls holding hands?  As the ancient Hawaiians used to say, time for a dicking!      Maybe some people here actually like the het couples for themselves, and not as a reaction to the SJWs?     They never even spoken to each other.

Despite her appearances she looks like the sensitive type.    So now /u/ fags settle for crack pairing RibbonNatsuki?      People still caring about Reina/Kumiko when Ribbons/Natsuki is the hottest shit around.       She looks like yandere. After she realized that Kumiko NTRed her, she will probably cut off Taki's head and show it to Kumiko.    What is she doing?   She's just asking to be raped and impregnated.   Keep that ribbon slut away from my 10/10 qt    Why not? Is it disrupting your "I want to fuck Natsuki" shitposting?   Who /fuck kumiko/ here? not Shitichi, that's for sure.   Delicious sailor Taki.    NO    Situation is still salvageable.   <br/>     only 1 knife   Pleb. High-tier yanderes duel wield.       Shoeitchy is such a pathetic little shit, that's for sure. Wants to go out with Kumiko, but then he's never there for her when she's having trouble and could need some emotional support. Fuck him. I'm glad he's getting NTR'd by Taki, he deserves it.     implying it was an unrequited love  They have hot hot drill sex every night     *dual        anti/u/ autists still mad at another board   Still obsessed enough to go to a board they hate about a subject they hate and whine about the users being disappointed in the lack of the subject they like in a show with pandering for that subject.   This is like going to /v/ when they still had anime threads and obsessively screenshotting their reactions to whatever shounen shit they like at the time.  What the fuck is wrong with you          I'd like you to remember that /u/fags started that retarded war when they flooded /a/ with their "hetfag BTFO" shit after episode 8 had aired. They deserve all backlash they receive.   inb4 b-but that was just falseflagging I swear        Still obsessed about shitposting that happened weeks ago.   Get the fuck over it and stop being obsessed with /u/ you autismal fuck       The only way /a/ opens up to Rbbons is, her walking the yuri path.      fuck  You don't fuck the Kumiko, you make passionate love to her.      B-but they're the one who started this REEEEEEE      they started it!    this shit again   this shit AGAIN        They talk about the show and what they think of the KumikoxReina ship. The Seyuu of Kumiko said they like each other, or more like that's what she thinks.   I thought the guy in the trumpet section didn't pass the audition.   Hetfags are still mad they got trolled by people pretending to be yurifags in Love Lab threads.   MidoriXmelonpan OTP.  Quite certain Kindergarteners aren't allowed here.   Every boy in the band made the audition because they're not slackers.    Because she's usually a huge bitch but gets flustered when Natsuki is around   ALL THESE REINA JELLY over Kumiko spending time alone with Taki. Hahahaha    I'm a fan of yuri and I even post on /u/ from time to time. Not too often, I made maybe 10, 15 posts there in the last month, and only like two of those were in /u/ H!E threads, so it's not like I only post there because of this anime.  You don't need to be a yurihater to think that the idea of an anime original yuri end at this point is beyond absurd and want to know how can people still hope for it.   Those are just shitposters, idiot. People who know you get easily upset over yuri since you associate with SJW/tumblr/whatever and act obnoxiously to make you dislike yuri fans even more. Then people like you start shitting on yuri fans, and the legitimate yuri fans get upset and start shitting on your kind, and then it's a vicious cycle of shitposting. If you didn't fall for the bait none of this would happen. The original shitposters will just get bored and move on to a different target.  Also, it's stupid to equate between /u/ and /a/ yuri fans. Most /a/ yuri fans seem to utterly despise /u/ because of the Western content there, and most /u/ posters think of /a/ being almost as bad as /v/ these days and avoid this board like a plague.           Hetfag BTFO was clearly /sp/ posters funposting.    Reina more like REEEEEEEEEEEina, amirite fellas?    I swear they're probably women because only a scorned woman would still be mad over shit that happened almost two years ago   Why the fuck are you obsessively taking screenshots then? There's no point other than to stir shit. Their opinions are honestly irrelevant and not worth mentioning in the long run.   So some fucks on another board has hope for another outcome for the show and it's likely that some of those fucks don't even post here?  Who cares            "y-you wanna smell my armpits? why?"      because of the Western content there  Interesting, I remember that when I stopped going to /u/ a few years ago, there was a lot of shitflinging over Western content being allowed or not. So that's where the scales fell.      Natsuki stuttering   You don't watch this show, do you?      Yurifaggots tend not to give a shit about personalities when it comes to their shipping.    This.  I find it funny than no one on /u/ actually gave a damn about Love Lab after learning the premise and checking the manga, but on /a/ threads had so many shitposters whining why it's not full yuri etc. all the time.  And seeing /u/ board posts about this Hibike show and then checking /a/ threads, the only correct conclusion is that /a/ trolls itself with phantom yurifags, once playing the role of them and then doing reverse and scorning them.       Both /u/fags and hetfags are cancer.   Musicbros  are where it's at. We won this episode, boys!      Tell the mod moot create /lgbt/ for a reason.     Not really. That one pixiv faggot prove otherwise.     natsukifags   yurifags     How to troll anti/u/fags  Pick two girls that seem really close together. The more prominent, the better.  When they have a good moment alone together that has the slightest hint of romanticism  Shitpost with "hetfags btfo" or any variant. Spread rumors about the production team changing shit if it's an adaptation.  Sit back and let the salt flow   There wasn't even any yuri posting in that post anon              You still get people bitching about it from time to time, but it only happens in non-Western threads when someone mentions something Western (e.g. Korra being a "/u/ victory"), people don't tell people making threads about Western content to kill themselves anymore, like in the good old days.  moot really should have made a NSFW /co/ instead of allowing Western content on /u/.      I thought he created that board only to see /pol/ being angry    You mean the picture of the samurai being upset about Love Lab not being yuri?  I think that was made on 2chan and translated by /u/   It's a tranny containment board, not a board to discuss media          Shitposting from both sides always bring salt. /u/ or het.   All of them are the same salty shitbags.       hetfags   straightfags   het   straight   fags        One of the reasons why this episode was my favorite was because of how it hit so close to home. I fucking love music so damn much.     moot really should have made a NSFW /co/ instead of allowing Western content on /u/.  But msot of western content on /u/ is not neven NSFW, you get info about movies, tv shows, games, literature, comics, add to that the usual anime and manga yuri subtext threads from non-yuri shows, and as cherry on top we finally get some real japanese origin yuri either in anime/manga/hentai form.  And to be honest western content keeps the /u/ board active a bit more than having all the time the same repost image threads.  I don't mind too much cause I actually like to follow everything lesbian/bisexual related in one place.        ナイスメメ！！  http://www.kyotoanimation.co.jp/eve<wbr>nt/ax2015/   only one merch for Hibike   Even that i doubt that would sell much compared to Free! stuff that obviously sold like hotcakes.  The land of Freedom citizens loves Free!     </wbr>  I can't wait for their next interaction.   イツライクポエツリ     I can't wait for the millions of landwhales to flood the place.     going to the nurse's office for a fucking nosebleed     I really wish Shuichi crossed the street letting hetfags feel some form of hope then gets absolutely crushed by a bus, crushing their dreams.  The salty tears will be delicious! Alas, can't have them all.        all that Free shit  Absolutely disgusting.      no Natsuki  Why even bother      only character specific merch is of Makoto  Heh     pottery right here    Woah, hey you okay there buddy? Sounding a little miffed perhaps? Try not to be cut on your edge though, it's bad for your health.       he pays for things  Look at this retard.      Stay bitter yurifag. Stay bitter.    I want to date her.    hetfags  Whoever coined this term is retarded.      KyoAni makes the most delicious girls you'd want to hatefuck.      hatefuck   hate      We could be losers together,     It's for fucking the bitch out of her, anon. A purification method to cleanse the evil inside of her.      It means fucking them to appease your sexual desires all the while you still show disdain towards them.  Take this other hate-fuckable girl for example.       But Shinka is best girl.   Why is she so smug?    But msot of western content on /u/ is not neven NSFW, you get info about movies,   Yes, that's how it is right now. But when it first started, it was different. At first, Western content wasn't allowed. Then after some point, you only had a "containment" thread for all Western content (I don't think the term general thread existed yet), and over time it spread more and more to the way it is today. So this wouldn't have happened if the first step was not taken since there was an alternative board for that Western content.  At least that's how I remember it, I could be wrong.    And to be honest western content keeps the /u/ board active a bit more than having all the time the same repost image threads.  I've always disliked this argument. Not every board needs to be a fast one. It's okay to have slow boards. There are plenty of boards that are much slower than /u/. And for people who are interested in yuri content only, the Western content is not a positive at all.   I don't mind too much cause I actually like to follow everything lesbian/bisexual related in one place.  Fair enough, but look at it from the other point of view. If the boards were separated, you would just need to open two tabs. It makes no real difference to you. But people who don't want Western content and only want yuri content don't have that option. Numerous /u/ threads, the ones not dedicated to specific pairing/franchise (e.g. ones dedicated to a specific sexual act), often have both yuri and Western content posted in them. For people who don't like Western content, that's annoying.             Oh god, imagine the two of the alone and they start to banter and things then turn slightly physical and one of them accidentally trips over and the other one goes down too and they are then facing each other and they start to blush and get all tsundere.    So basically Dekomori and Nibutani?    no, Natsuki and Ribbons are much better because its nowhere as forced as they are and Natsuki is best girl.     Natsuki is Asuka's property.     Shimakaze plz    Contrabass because I play the bass and I suck at wind instruments    wat?       how do I into developing my own opinion    Thank you based KyoAni!        where's asuka   what's she doing    i wish i could see her    will this band bullshit took long to end   i wanna hang out with asuka    which panties is she possible wearing today            Actually she doesn't. She is a horrible character, quite retarded and useless.   Is Reina going to stab Kumiko with a kitchen knife?   Either trying too hard or really, really new.    I had a dream about Kaori and Asuka making out last night.     this THIS new      master1200.jpg   there are people this new here   I guess only night threads are remotely enjoyable safe from all those crossboarders.      Kumiko's reaction to being cut from practice was great.   Yeah. I especially liked how they showed everyone else's reactions first.    1 week for the next and last episode    Don't forget her shitty character design.    The face of KyoAnus lickers, everyone      it's the last episode   It better be fucking good.       I haven't seen many good final episodes the past few years.    I CANT FUCKING WAIT FOR THIS HET VS YURI STRESS TO FINALLY END     Shinka   Not the bro to end all bros      I'm sad as fuck already, I wish it wouldn't end ;_;     it's time   Thank god this faggot is rotting in jail.     hating shinka  What a loser.     You know the full 12 minutes will be devoted to then playing the music. Whether or not it will be good depends on how much you love music.    That's because anime are no longer made with an actual ending in mind. They have become marketing tools for shitty light novels.   So I just looked at the /u/ thread for this show and they seem resigned to the fact that /u/ isn't actually happening.  Why has /a/ led me to believe that they are all delusional shipperfags that try and deny everything hetero in the series?  The people from /u/ that post here seem way more delusional than the people actually posting on /u/.       Why  why are Kamigawa cards so bad      Trombone master race fucking get at me faggots    If Kumiko fucking talks over it the whole time I swear to god    /u/ is full of broken hearts, trampled by the world  here we have bright-eyed dreamers      Pride anon, they've come this far, backing off at this point will hurt their pride and they'll feel like bunch of losers.       the most 4chan series of replies ever       She'll never know that Shuichi shit talked her behind her back.   What's Kumiko thinking of?  How does she read the sheet music?   lelouch pls    With her eyes.    She kinda has to, otherwise it will literally be 12 minutes of nothing but music, and we're getting those for the OST. She'll probably introspect at a few points with an occasional 'wow, they're good' from the audience so non-music watchers wouldn't get too bored.    Why don't they put music on tablets and have it move automatically over time?    It's pretty fucking obvious to anyone with half a brain that there won't be any conclusive romantic ending. Shuichi only ends up with Kumiko at the end of the very last novel, so a het end for s1 was literally impossible from the very beginning. Kyoani know that they will never get to animate all the novels, so they cut out most of Shuichi's romantic development and replaced it with more Reina and Kumiko scenes.   This was never a romance show, it was a SoL music anime with yuri fanservice.      I've checked there a few times for different shows and each time they are predominately cautiously optimistic to pessimistic.    /u/ is actual lesbians, the yurifags on /a/ are the male equivalent of fujoshi    Tablets are expensive and are harder to replace, dust.    Contrabass because wind instruments are pure shit.    Is this the narrative the hardcore hetfags are going for once the finale aired? No one is expecting a full blown yuri end, literally no one. We have enjoyed a show full of quality yuri fanservice and that's it. We won because we enjoyed this show whereis you hated every moment Reina and Kumiko shared screentime together and all you were clinging to this whole time were novel spoilers of the very last volume, which will never be animated.     Kyoani know that they will never get to animate all the novels  Why do so many people believe they can see the future? Is the concept of conditionality nonexistent to them?     /lgbt/ are the real lesbians, /u/ are imaginary lesbians.    I feel like Ruby or whatever the hell is her name never talked to anyone outside of Kumiko.    Says the Anon who has been to neither board.    She was betrayed by Ribbondas Iscariot.    In the history of their studio, Kyoani have never animated more than 2 seasons of one anime. Even moneycows like Haruhi or K-On didn't get a 3rd one.   reina please   1 week  until they next show for fall season.     Hey, thanks for telling me shit I already knew, but it might be helpful to know that that has nothing to do with this show.   Rewatch this scene give me a very difference feeling.  Asuka sure is the master of acting.     fuck    Look at that chuuni bitch.   So when's Shuumai going to win the Kumiko-bowl    The people from /u/ that post here  Holy shit you're a gullible fagott if you actually believe the '/u/' posts you see here are actually from /u/.     didn't haruhi's author have a writer's block and k-on manga guy ran out of ideas?    Are you stupid or something? The fact that Kyoani have never done a 3rd season of an anime before is kind of a strong indication that they will not animate 4 seasons of this one.    She doesn't care.     Super special.     Good to know you were as dumb as I thought.  First of all, the last book is just side stories. Some of which have already been hinted at this season. An entire season for it is completely unnecessary.  Secondly, the next two books can be done in a 2 cour second season, or a 1 cour second season and a movie, or whatever. Both of which KyoAni's already done.  And lastly, yeah I know it's incredibly unlikely, but just because they haven't before doesn't mean KyoAni CAN'T do 3 fucking seasons of a show. Nothing is stopping them besides what fan think they do. But should a continuation happen, the former two possibilities are more likely.  And lastly, you do know that with its sequel, Clannad is essentially 4 cour, right?          From sleepychan to best girl   Someone please explain the point of posts like these to me.   Couldn't handle the banter.   Whoa, anon.  Free S3 is still possible, if you mean that      To annoyed the fuck out of your autisic mind?    I loved that scene.    Ayy lmao.    Better than "lolol Hetfag BTFO" or "I hate /u/ they are shit" shouting out of nowhere.    Alto saxes, because  I don't think I can return to the flutes after betraying them.   At least there's slut-chan with me.      I just imagine the people passing and watching two teenage shouthing at each others and crying.    Kyoani is like Valve  They can't count to three       alto sax   flute   Are you a girl?       Your comment about narratives is pretty ironic considering how you're trying to push one yourself.  There were numerous people arguing about Kyoani not sticking to the source material, giving an anime original end, and how novel spoilers don't matter since its a different continuity. There were numerous people arguing about how the scenes aren't just yuribait (or as you called it, "quality yuri fanservice") but instead have a much deeper, romantic meaning.  On the other hand, the only person I remember "hating" Kumiko and Reina scenes was that one self-insert blogger, who was probably just a falseflagging shitposter in the first place. No one actually hates yuribait scenes. Despite all the focus they get in these threads, they take literally a minute an episode. Besides the episode 8 one, that is. People are just tired of obnoxious shitposters who ruin threads with their insufferable shipperfaggotry and wanted them to shut up.  Why do you think people spammed those novel spoilers? They knew they weren't going to be animated. They just wanted you people to shut up already.             Social outcast losers trying to pretend they have some level of relationship to a girl while also trying their hardest to imitate all the other posters they see to try and feel like they finally fit in with some community.    No, which is why I switched to the saxes. Picked up an Alto first to know the fingerings.      to annoyed   Well thanks for confirming my suspicion.   Being slightly less shitty than shipperfagotts doesn't make it good.         What the flying fucking hell are you talking about? Literally every single yurifag was screaming that KyoAni was disregarding the source material despite it being way more yuri-ish than anything in the anime.     Literally every single yurifag  Literally not a single one.     How about you use MAL instead.   Reina and Taki are so cute. I hope he can return her feelings at some point and be happy. That would make me so happy I could probably die.   You can just look at the the archive.    The whole "We never expected it to be yuri!" is getting a bit repetitive by this point.     euphonium   It has best girls.     Am I supposed to believe that Kumiko is unable to play quarternotes after playing the euphonium for more than 5 years?   You know someone's desperate when they resort to the Reddit / MAL dankery.     No one actually hates yuribait scenes. Despite all the focus they get in these threads, they take literally a minute an episode. Besides the episode 8 one, that is.  Not the guy you're replying to, but that's really not true. Tons of people hated the scenes. Yurifags even made a collage of one example that it happened.  Essentially, I think people hated seeing yuri in the anime precisely because yurifags got what they wanted, enjoyed seeing it, and would probably gush about it in the threads.   Also, KyoAni isn't sticking to the source material. But that's just in general.         Still best.   Yeah, it wasn't very believable. Depending on episode 13 it might have been simply to draw the parallel with Shuichi to set up for their warm and fuzzy reconciliation as they drive each other to get better.  Which would be piss poor by KyoAnus.      What's actually the point of any post in this thread then?    THIS EPISODE A BEST    That was great....she's like a refugee from School Days at this point.   The smile of someone who knows he already won.   80% of the show is the source material; all the yuri comes from the source material.     hurr durr what is life anyway   Please.      melonpan NTR'ing Shana yet again!     80% of the show is the source material; all the yuri comes from the source material.  Post stop posting before someone believes you.     she's so in love with him is endearing and cute and wonderful   Will there be a second season?    :^)       WHAT IS THAT ?   Let the tears fall.   You'll never just yell shit at Kumiko over a bridge.    He got good and had a play with Kumiko over the fucking river.         The only purpose was the give her and Shuucihi a bonding moment and to get over their awkwardness.  Shuuichi having trombone issues was not in the novels, so this is the only reason to add it.       No one actually hates yuribait scenes.  Speak for yourself.  I've actually even encountered yurifags who started to resent those scenes, because they were tired of nothing ever coming out of it in the end. They would've enjoyed the show more without the yuribait, since they could've just enjoyed it for the band drama without agonizing over a yuri couple that just won't materialize. Those yurifags may be a tiny minority, sure, but they do exist. The lesson here is: NEVER generalise.  Also, self-insert blogger may have been a shitposter, but I wouldn't be surprised in the least if people who think or feel like him do exist on /a/.        I know I wouldn't have any trombone issues with kumiko, amirite?   Holy shit I just realized it's been twelve episodes and we still don't know Sleepy-chan's name.   Yurifag here yuribait makes me upset    nakagawa natsuki    Tokube ABSOLUTELY AUTISTIC     It's our old pal, the novel page where Kumiko confesses her love for Shuichi.    You serious?    It's beautiful because at this moment they share a bond that goes beyond spoken words, they both love music, and through that love they'll eventually get to love each other, and this is clear to everyone that paid attention to this scene, but /u/fags missed the point entirely because they're unable of comprehending anything that's not directly said for them.    Short answer, no.    Anyone have a webmd of natsuki doing that goofy run in the background?    Only main/semi-important characters that I still call by nickname is ribbon.   Amber-chan! Amethyst-chan! Aquamarine-chan! Citrine-chan! Crystal Quartz-chan! Diamond-chan! Emerald-chan! Opal-chan! Peridot-chan! Ruby-chan! Sapphire-chan! Spinel-chan! Tanzanite-chan! Topaz-chan! Tourmaline-chan! Turquoise-chan! Zircon-chan!                   Long answer, maybe.     This. As much as I enjoy girls being cute and intimate with each other, it's really hurting the story at this point. Their relationship changes so much it feels inconsistent.      Probably not.     Disguisting.    Midget-chan   Why did Reina apologize? Did she get sorted out off screen?    As long as people tolerate yuri bait over there at japan, Kyoani will keep on getting away with it.     fagott, obviously.     Nice to see KyoAni clearing up from their yuribaiting. Episode got a better atmosphere as a result.   Also, I can't imagine how resource consuming it is to hire a professional brassfag to play something intentionally bad.     Double reed both characters and instrument wise.    Yuri only sells well if it's bait and they also have the hots for the male MC    ayy lmao      Being unpopular wears down on you as a teenager. We could already see her struggling to deal with it when she was sad she'd be a villain if she won the audition.  She's slowly improving her autistic condition.      Johnson     when_shuu1_sticks_it_up_wrong_hole<wbr>.png</wbr>      She's slowly improving her autistic condition.  More like she's giving it all to Kumiko.     You been watching the show nigga? When she went told everyone they were shit compared to her after it looked like her solo might get swiped away? Got to soothe those waters.    I thought it was fake.    Tenor sax, because I get to have a saxbro        Ah, one word too many.    And just when Ufo-kun was made…    Delete this.     All for Taki-sensei.    Reminder     Kitauji concert band power levels     Oboe-chan  -- POWER GAP --   Asuka    Midori    Reina            speedweed     Kaori is just increasing her lung capacity by blowing balloons anon.     You're way behind the times with your denial strategy, /u/fag. Nowadays it's fashionable to claim the editor forced it on the author against her will without any evidence backing this up.    There we go      Since when has Reina been yandere for sensei?      Nowadays it's fashionable to claim the editor forced it on the author against her will without any evidence backing this up.   I remember that shit.      the red string is meaningless    do you know how much it hurts to have your hymen broken by Taki sensei?     Did you even watch the last episode?    "Toriyama actually wanted to end at Frieza saga, it was all the editors doing!"  /u/fags are these people      Doujins when?    His penis is probably not too big. It'd be an easy first taste.    Why do you think Reina wants him so bad? She's seen it.    ALL THE YURI COMES FROM THE NOVEL    O-oh, is that what it is?     The ED in general is meaningless.     From what I hear, novel 2 has even more bait than KyoAni ever did. But it's still meaningless bait.   Didn't watch the later half episodes of this series but did KyoAni really go for the yurishit/bait end?   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YHY<wbr>WAXFvs0Q</wbr>  [ ]  the OST has a full Crescent Moon Dance (Kaori solo audition)   she deserves this       It wasn't as blatant or obnoxious. From cheek poke to lip-sliding. Kyoani really outdid themselves in the baiting department.     What? The second novel has tons of yuribait, but almost everything in the anime is new. Plus, ep 11 is gayer than anything from the novels.    No, they confirmed Reina being straight twice in just a few episodes.     Didn't watch the later half episodes of this series  no and you're missing out    Where's the faggot that was working on the kaori doujin?   I guess they could still technically go for a yuribait end. Actual yuri is definitely out of the question, though.     kaori doujin     This    brilliant    I know I wouldn't join bass, french horn, trombone or trumpet  becouse asuka, grumpy chan, drills, reina and ribbon scare me        not wanting to join the horn section and have all the girls to yourself since you're the only male   What are you some kind of a massive flaming faggot?       why is the thought of NTRing Reina so great? I don't even particularly like this stuff but I want to see her reaction    I'd join Oboe &amp; fagott. I want to play Oboe-chan.   Pokemon has great girls, do you agree?  I love all the girls.  Except Misty, who was kind of a bitch.  Iris was a bitch too, but damn if I don't love her design.      Yes, so which should I jerk it to today?   Skyla    Don't think I've ever done it to her actually, so okay.    There should be a roulette for this, it's hard as fuck to decide who to do it to sometimes.    They are all extremely fappable.    gen 5 hast best girls. The best being the bun girl with the leggings.      TFW most pokemon doujins are furryshit   Why     I just wish the artists didn't give the girls watermelons instead of breasts. THat-s fucking disgusting.     TFW only played XY because my custom Serana     you played as the superior and cutest color serena, right?   CORNI TIME!!  if corni was a bit tanner with everything else she do be perfection.   just imagine her spat's tan line.       she sees your dick       Wanting a furfag or better, a lucariofag       her spats and midriff make my dick hard though   she also has the fluffiest canon vag     she flashes you with her spats                     dem comfy pajamas  Are we autosaging?       Whoops, guess not.           where my /vp/oreons at   Probably at /vp/   <br/>  Most of the best girls are gym leaders.  even the background characters are cute!  I want to be a Pokegirl     he has read 'that' doujin       *hasn't.    Hilda has the best ass, so her.    Or Dawn.     tfw no Rosa anime    Why do pokègirls always dress like sluts?   They are extremely fappable.    Twinbuns girl looks god tier      May is the probably on of the best looking trainers     Probably the best thi g to come ouf of BW           10 (TEN) YEARS OLD          Sometimes when I look at pokemon girls, I feel the need to replay/play all the pokemon games again  But I won't do that      I always do.       back to your containment board, autistic manchild.      Good taste   No one here likes Sabrina?        not posting best boy    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113964  Yes     POST HILDA         You will never lose a battle and have to pay with your body        that pic where the lass does     Best girl will never be animated    didn't even appear in the anime   replaced with a shitty nigger loli  No wonder BW is easily the worst series        Only best boy deserves the best girl. Not Ash.   Reminder that Serena was voted the best on /a/.  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1El<wbr>1f1F8zXviEONk5y0Uy2dntwVkCqrF_Hpyo5<wbr>j2yIWA/viewanalytics?usp=form_confi<wbr>rm</wbr></wbr></wbr>      I think they made the right choice. I wouldn't want her to be sullied by Ash and his losing streak     The only exception is Hilda, she's 14-ish   Cynthia a best  Needs more doujins.   Right on.     As hard as diamond   Especially the participant of kalos queen competition or whatever the name is.    Game Serena is something like 16, while ORAS May is canonically 12. The whole 10-year-old protagonist thing only ever applied to the anime; the game versions have always been older.   Best girl, why doesn't anyone remember her?     he hasn't read Chibikko Bitch XY 1 and 2       YOU probably wouldn't walk for weeks - she's definitely a ravager.     read them both. Thats why is said MORE. Get your memes out of here.     Go on.    I really really like this picture     Just the way I like it.    Quick reminder that the Pokemon anime is still shit because it still focuses on Ash and Pikachu losing every league.   Seriously, how hard could it have been to make Ash the aged mentor to the XY protagonist? Maybe make him an Elite 4 member who travels around a lot?     Not after the shit pile that was Best Wishes. Maybe next gen. Hopefully next gen. At least let this Ash retire in peace. If it absolutely positively needs to be an Ash in the starring role, then just switch to a different one courtesy of Hoopa.     This. You also can easily spot an anime-onlyfag or a Genwunner when they mention the whole 10-years-old shtick. I'd say the very least, they're 12. Leaf comes off as that age anyway.      Most people have never read the manga either and don't realize that everybody actually ages as the story progresses. Ash is the only oddball in the whole franchise, he more of an anomaly. I wonder if Ash even exists at all      It was mostly in jest, but I agree there are those who still think so.  And just look at those proportions.       sabrina a qt3.142. Can Sabrina read minds with her psychic abilities?    anon have you not seen b2w2's promotional trailer?    Same with May, I know there are ten year olds with developed bodies(I saw many of them in my school at fifth grade), but in all honestly twelve is the borderline to being considered a young adult or a full fledged adult in certain societies.   <br/>   I love that image. It show how slutty Rosa and how pure Hilda.       pure   those shorts   Nah they're both sluts.        Ash got blasted with so much shit that he's a minor deity at this point. He will never age. He will never die. He will roam the Pokemon world for all eternity. His body will always be exactly 10 years, 10 months, and 10 days old.     And he will always have the brain of a 10 year old - he will never learn, he will always job.     since Black and White, the protagonists have all been AT LEAST 14 which is legal in Japan.   though I do guess perhaps ORAS might still be different since remake and all that.       I bet they would have been great in any anime      Nah I know, I've played every game to date, and watched the anime.    I wish they would have gotten May's original design and her pure waifu personality on or/as.  it also has great pokemon  Pokemon was a mistake   Nah, even a 10-year-old can learn. In fact, they're irritatingly good at that. Ash did a pretty good job of dealing with Fairy-types with a Fighting-type in his latest gym battle, so clearly he's figured something out about not jobbing. Who knows, maybe he'll find a way to grow up some day.  Maybe it'll work too well and he'll become a giant. Maybe he'll end up building a turbolaser to resurrect Pikachu and spend the next 3000 years atoning for it.     Speaking of the anime, has anybody gone back and started rewatching the series from the beginning all the way through?     Ash becomes AZ   Sasuga.       someone needs to slow this down     Or a webm so I can pause it.     Nah, the first season is bad. Ash is a total faggot. But I'd rewatch Orange league.     dat puffy vag    The purest  Why is she so under-appreciated?    Because Sky Battles are shit, she didn't deserve this.       You're not wrong, but at the same time, I would think there'd be more fans regardless of game mechanics. Even the freediver was pretty simple to battle, and she's just as under-appreciated.   Serena is waifu tier   Cute or sex?       you will never be forced to call him master and obey his every command     Underrated post    sex    My nigga.    Minbreak.    You disgust me.    My dick!    You shouldn't do mean things to White.   Post best pokemon  vanilla  doujins.   I want to violate her.     Shut it, kid.     Only recently did I take note of how stupidly nubile Rosa's body is. I never understood why people liked her until I saw the good shit. My fucking God, when I die bury me in that ass.  May=Rosa&gt;Hilda&gt;Green&gt;Dawn&gt;Silver (or whatever that bitch from Gen II is named)      I wanna show her my dick.   Should I pick up the pokemon adventures manga?  guess i'll start with the best villian   yes. much better than the anime counterpart    http://exhentai.org/g/339759/ab4dac<wbr>1618/ http://exhentai.org/g/533163/7b2844<wbr>b039/</wbr> </wbr>   Sugimori mastered the fine art of drawing cute girls. Gamefreak should make a game focused around that and cash on it. Only creatures, no pokemon.  I want her milk   Breeding material     hating based Kris     Yes. It's different from the game and the series. http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>02067 Some guy uploaded the first 13 volumes in good quality.</wbr>       Yes.   What a qt.   Kindergarten teacher    Holy shit   what pokemon would you fuck   also a slut        No pokemon, but gijinka yes.     That's not stupid sexy Domino        <br/>    My favourite movie, and favourite bad girl.        I want her to step on me    <br/>   Damn I wish TR weren't such a joke in the anime. Poor Giovanni.     They were good in the beginning       that Serena       For all of like 3 episodes.     You have the right idea.    First 2d waifu.   Nobody ever mentions the female Ranger.  Oh well more of her for me.      implying you can have more than one waifu   implying a waifu can be anything other than 2D      this TR was never good.  now shut up and post Jessie in outfits that aren't her usual shit one.      Rangers are sluts.    Or Crystal, even. I remember many nights of fapping to her bike spats years ago, to that cover on that volume of Pokespe.    Imagine those biker thighs leglocking you.   Lets wait for spoilers and praise the most based character in the series so far. Explode Kill King   I don't understand why this series garners so much of this cancerous shit about best girls and whatnot, its really weird because its not something that happens in every battle shonen, well, hopefully the shitty fan base die off somehow.    It's /a/, here you'll see people enjoy a shonen based off how much waifufaggotry they can do. See naruto gaiden shifting from shitposting galore into waifufagging galore.     This one looks like the side characters may stay relevant. Never before seen in a Shounen since Yu Yu.    I don't like "Froppy" that much, it sounds pretty childish and simple, even for a frog girl. Uravity is much better.     Explodo King   most based   Nice autism you have there, we all know All Might is the most based.     http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87  Roundabout ED: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=izF<wbr>qa0i_EwI</wbr>  [ ]    Fuck anime-only fags  The last thread got deleted. I would give Jojo threads a rest for a few days and talk about it when the new chapter comes out. Before the mods start really cracking down.   There really isn't much to talk about right now until JJL 44 is out.    I'm going to post some hi res art.   Pio    Well, your probably right but maybe if we keep this thread low key and and see if it can stretch out a while.     Now that Stardust Crusaders is over, it's the duty of every anime-only fag to start reading the manga.  Alright guys, here's the thing. Jebus replied to the request to make the /a/ sings JoJo Sono Chi no Kioku -end of THE WORLD-, which is great. Also If mods are cracking down on the threads, this is also a good way to take a break until the new chapter comes out.  The only problem is, i'm not the guy that suggested the /a/ sings in the first place, and I won't be able to make any threads for it since i'll be in a place without internet for the next few weeks.  Are any of you up for organizing it? You don't have to worry about the technical stuff, just request vocaroo and leave the rest up to Jebus.  Link to the original thread that suggested it: https://archive.moe/a/thread/126877<wbr>460/#126878511</wbr>         It has been two years since I read the entirety of JoJo, and I'm just now watching the anime. God I love this shit. It only took one episode before I started autistically posing. Just minutes ago I pointed at the milk.  part 7 anime never ever     nth for you can't find a better cosplay     Nice!      This. Are you listening, animeonlyfags? Do this.       So the /a/ sings is about to start? Fuck yeah.     Diana Divine, Ukraine, and Kira Buckland are the best    If you niggas are on here, hello             Why couldn't Koichi keep his hair perma-Super Saiyan? Looked so much better than his shitty flat top.       The Gucci art still gets to me with Bruno and Jolyne. Still wish those art pieces that were done as fronts for Gucci stores was made into some artbooks or something. Unless they where and I didn't look hard enough.     Jonathan where are your gains    I don't know, I think it's kind of cute.   Post yfw  I'LL BE THE ROUUUUUUNNDDDABOOOOUUUUUT       Post yfw  Let's not.      mfw I'm reading the manga in another tab and I just got to this scene less than a minute before you posted it      Sorry, this is what I meant to post.       Well really, I think the last thread was deleted mainly because it was inciting no discussion. This one is. So maybe it was a warning of such. If you want these threads to survive post responsibly I guess.    I thought we already did this. I know Bloody Stream was done but not sure about the others.         Araki's new art gave him a terminal disease.      Giorno, chairs don't just work like that   no neck scar      how would win in a fight, GER or Demonbane   Could be Awakened Dio?      I never really got why Araki decided to draw Alessi in drag (or whatever that is that gets used for one of his victory animations).    This and the HD background you're given on the PSN copy is great. I wish ASB got the same treatment of current-style-Araki for the cover.   I don't think Araki did any illustrations for ASB. Shame really.      It's his younger form      that World   It's like it lost any sense of danger to it, especially in SBR.      There's something really cool about Gappy on a car hood.  hurdur dubs   Demonbane because GER counts as being an aspect of it. Also, GER is not that broken at all. Or rather, it maybe is, but we don't know for sure. Talking about GER powerlevels is like talking about 2hu pwoerlevels, it's stupid and best not to do it.    Cover for a novel about Part 4.   I hope he keeps the Lambo he just won.    Koichi got a bad case of the uglies     Koichi's face    What are the chances of part 4 anime being made?   60-70%     buy muh BDs  Depends     Pretty high probably. How have the BDs been selling?    Pretty much  v3 of Egypt came out today and it's selling pretty well. 10k average is considered decent. We'll likely get the TBC arrow at the end of BDv6 and then the official announcement at Jump Festa in December.   Sup  Gay Priest is here now.    tfw bought all of the Jojoniums and didn't get the poster with the last volume.     Avdol looking pretty gay.     everything looks different   except The Fool   Oh well, at least Araki remembered that Polnareff has no eyebrows this time.      Who's rewatching the blurays   Quick, we must recite the 14 phrases. I'll start. Rasen Kaidan      Koichi later died of a cold     Kabutomushi    Haikyo no Machi    Kakyoin (unsurprisingly) got affected the least other than the Fool and Heirophant, but his lips look off there. Kinda looks like a monkey.    Not as gay as Polnareff.    Jesus, no. ASB's jp cover was great.     That Star Platinum   No ORA here.     How is JoJo so referenceable  Please uncover Araki's secret     Magician's Red looks high as fuck    The levels of fabulous and over the top.    Poses can make any panel memorable.     It's pretty flexible when characters can just do poses and it's identifiable to JJBA.    JoJo Tournament starting in ten minutes!  Stream: Twitch - TheTokiEffect Bracket: http://challonge.com/WTBJoJoASB  Get hype if you want           I meant referencing JoJo like this  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zB<wbr>21AodZF30</wbr>  [ ]   How does Araki pull it off          Okay Joshykins    This   And because it did literally everything first. Pick a plot, any plot. Jojo did it first. Titanic? Jojo did it first. Guile? Stroheim sees your family man and raises you GERMAN SCIENCE. Broken-ass timestopping powers? They all wish they could match up to DIO. Personas? We all know they're just lousy rip-offs of Stands.   Can Zappa be a honorary Jojo?   His name is a music reference and he dresses weird. That's good enough for me    Did Jonathan do being a Kenshiro ripoff first?   Man, not to make a blog post, but I'm so glad I found JoJo in late 2014. I normally kind of hate anime/manga but this is so perfect. JoJo is just so, what it is. It's so honest. JoJo is extremely eccentric but doesn't have the slightest bit of irony in its execution. It's strange but not in a modern way self-aware way, it's absolutely earnest. It's just so pure, like this is what you get when an eccentric writes something for 30 years and I love it.  I'm currently reading Part 8 and man it's so good.     All money on JoJo.    He did Kenshiro: Vampire Hunter first.    Starting now with:  Joseph Joestar vs Josuke Higashikata (8)     New chapter when    heart headband   his seizures are just him cycling through JoJo poses   his best ghost is Star Platinum   the series has a ton of other JoJo references   sure. He better be in Xrd soon. Faust isn't enough.         johhny will probably win because Ai can into short characters but hoping for the gio or jolyne win     Is this supposed to be Soft &amp; Wets early design or is it the other stand Killer Queen fused with?    That's always my favorite way to describe why I love Jojo so much too. There are a lot of silly series's out there, but no series is as silly as Jojo while taking itself completely seriously.    This. Not only that, it also has a very palpable epic (in the actual sense of the word) feel. The many generatios of Joestars, their many different enemies and friends, the many different plots. It's very powerful when you think about all of it.    It's S&amp;W's early design. It took him a while to show up.    About another week perhaps. The group hasn;t gotten the scans yet apparently.    32 ips   95 posts   "edition" in the OP   Time to let the series die, guys. Move on.

Isn't five fucking stands a bit too much?   new chapter when  The way they ended the s1 episodes like that were money. They shoulda kept doin it with other songs or somethin    In one of my more pretentious and wordy moments, I described Jojo like this: "No matter how kooky the adventures get in JoJo, it's always respectful of the human spirit." It definitely is "epic." It's a story spanning hundreds of years and two universes, yet it's full of characters that, despite being cartoons, feel absolutely human.     Zappa Villian of part 8 when     They all look pretty gay to be honest    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=g0L<wbr>vHu-dZr8</wbr>  [ ]  I kinda wish someone bothered to sub this.    I'm rereading Phantom Blood and just realized Dio is reading Gorgeous Irene  Infinity &gt; Zero confirmed    No offense, But Jo2suke is a black guy, He just look too black for me.      DIO used to have dark hair   So did Giorno      This is probably due to the fact that Araki does Jin Yong style characterization. Jin Yong is a super famous Chinese Wuxia author, and one of his trademarks is giving stories to pretty much every named character that appears. On top of giving them backstories, he doesn't feel the need to write extremely complex characters and instead tries to make them all striking, whether they are 1-dimensional or multi-dimensional. And it works. Araki pretty much does the exact same thing, just to a lesser extent because we don't have biographies of every character. But the effect is still the same, it just works.   Launching mass Villain tournament! Johnny won the JoJos.  See   Bracket: http://challonge.com/WTBVIllainASB        Gappy isn't black, he doesn't like fried chicken at all. Don't you dare force your Tumblr-tier headcanons onto him.  On another note, why are there so many Josukes running around nowadays? Is he still Araki's number 1?       tournaments with JoJo ASB   it's like the one fighting game you don't use for tournaments      He's actually just Pinecone with slightly larger lips    I'm pretty sure it's a CPU vs CPU thing.    Johnny won the last one as well. This is suspicious.     Wow, I just say that He look like a black guy.     Frankly, Josuke could be three different races with people noticing it.         Bracket reset to accommodate Vanilla Ice.     I'm not seeing it really. Just a dude in a sailor suit with a gap in his teeth.      I just say that He look like a black guy   "No offense, but Jo2suke is a black guy"   RACIST      Made this just now.   Take away the suit and there's not even a slight resemblance to how he looks past the first few chapters.      This is good besides Koichi    Are you saying that God looks like a black guy?    Well yeah Araki isn't going to copy someone 100%. His art changes through a part and characters look different than how they looked before. I'd say the overall resemblance is still there though.     Not noticing Josuke's hipbones     He's always had wide hips    I don't know, I've seen many guesses for possible inspiration that feel closer to the end result to me.    That's what that beaner said, silly.    Josuke's hipbones   Please stop, I have a thing for hipbones.         Giorno has dark hair because he was created using Johnathan's cock and DNA.    The actual face design isn't based on pinecone for sure (he's not Japanese after all), but I'm pretty sure the overall look was based on him. Sailor uniform+hat+gap teeth isn't exactly a common combination.    Take away the suit and almost every one of Araki's characters are blank slates    mfw no Part 4   It's ogre.     The best part is that the colorists tried to color his black hair blonde.   Nepnep 2 when?   Not if you don't take away the hair.    I meant Pynchon there but the other anon could be right about the gap and uniform combination.    It's not like it didn't take MONTHS for an official announcement of Part 3 to arrive right     That everything   My DIIIICKKKK, JOSHUA JOESTAR SAVE ME Sauce       I refuse to believe that thing is organic    I want to run my fingers through it during sex.     It's probably all crusty from layers of hairspray and pomade.     I don't feel as if I'm being deterred from wanting to have sex with him.   Post your favourite JoJo analogies.   "It's like having an icicle up the ass!"      I read that as  Looking for a man that will change o&lt;&gt;one so I can rub my goopy vagina across my kitchen floor and pretend I'm a snail.         reading is hard...     You can read posts on these threads, can't you? Don't be a lazy faggot.     More Art!  Give me some good JoJo videos   So you watch dubs? Disgusting.      https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=eQ2<wbr>giHSp49A</wbr>  [ ]   I don't get the context of this drawing.  Why is Killer Queen dancing with a ballerina?

Also adding to the question        You just wasted a minute of my life.  Good job.       18:08:54      Johnny won the JoJos  Sasuga crippleman    Should i skip Part 5 since there are no good translations?   Walk on to bus   See this   What do?      no      Join the gang, develop a stand, develop a fashion sense.    Insert fingers into donut hair    Stop Fugo from raping the girl.    Drop a beat and start dancing   I'm reading part 7 and I think sometimes Araki forgets that Johnny can't walk. The way he easily moves around is not something he could do crawling.  What battle is this most like?   The spin doesn't have to explain shit.    DIO's World was full of weird ones.  As sure as you'll belch after drinking cola   like a student scrambling to finish an exam   like an icicle up the ass   rat shit in a bathroom   dog shit on a road          Silver Chariot Requiem Alternatively any fight with Joseph.     Call Mista a faggot.    It's actually possible for one to be paralyzed from knees down but it was probably just the combination of Araki not giving a fuck and just wanting it to look cool.    i think it's just his lower legs that are crippled     All of those and you didn't remember "as sure as getting your pants wet when you piss in the wind"?    Was Giorno affected by Pucci's time resting? Or is he and Emporio the only two walking around in the SBR universe with memories of the previous universe?   Johnny handstands everywhere offscreen  But yea that was probably the worst thing about an otherwise great Part. Johnny's disability felt meaningless.      there's probably a few more too   Which is superior, /a/?  Traps or tomboys?    Reverse traps  Tomboys &gt; traps  Bonus points for spats      So Tomboys then?     See the 2014 /a/ census. Tomboys beat all and traps are actually not that popular.     Tomboys because males are gross.      Tomboys   Girls with the worst part of being a girl removed by having the best parts of a fun male present    Traps   Penises with massive insecurities and hardly the best of either gender   Gee OP I dunno           No     Tomboy dominating traps is the only correct answer      ¿Por que no los dos?    Okay but what about both?  Tomboys  Traps are just girls for fags      Girls who look like girls &gt; girls who look like boys &gt; boys who look like girls         There can be only one.      Tomboys wearing strapons and dominating traps!     Tomboys are best   I think /a/'s definition of tomboy has become too wide.     Clearly you are not familiar with the character    Is this technically both?   I know the character, she might have the attitude, but not the looks.    I need a fucking doujin of that    I'd be fine with a teasing and cuddling doujin but fucking's fine too    She's a lesbian, not a tomboy.   Traps are only good for each other.    Draw a girl   Call it a boy   It is also straight       That's good too. I just want a lwed doujin of a tomboy and a trap.     http://fapservice.com/shishunki-na-<wbr>adam-light-novel-fanservice-compila<wbr>tion-vol-1-6/</wbr></wbr>   Absolutely wrong.     The hell are you talking about  Tomboy is all about the attitude        That's not even a trap  That's a semen demon      Tomboys are the personality of a guy in the body of a cute girl. Traps are the personality of a girl in the body of a cute guy.  It's clear which is superior.       bee   lesbian  what?  Also monkey is a lesbian and a tomboy.         what.          I would a trap but I would marry a tomboy.    I-I never watched past Bake and thought that was monkey, my bad Although I would still not consider monkey a tomboy because she still acts too feminine as a supporting character, leaning in on Araragi's arm while they walk and everything      She's not too feminine. She's just the right amount of feminine.    This is my all time favorite trap x tomboy / reverse trap couple.    You are wrong. Are you implying that all female characters that are athletic, like doing sports and are mostly interested in boy stuff are tomboys?  There are a lot of characters like that, doesn't mean they all are.       Best tomboy   Yes.  Also you're wrong.        Tomboys   They're not equivalent.  One is for closeted gays. The other is for faggots who are already out of the closet.    But which is which?      New chapter never     That is up to you to decide. Just trust your instincts.    This is the correct answer.      Persona 4 was great. It gave you a reverse trap and a tomboy.   do not forget best hermaphrodite   Did she have freckles in the anime? I didn't even notice.    Some traps act just like a tomboy because they look enough like a girl to be a tomboy    Tomboys are girls for fags.      I CANT DECIDE     <br/>     Genderbent characters aren't traps.    The one with more holes.    Well that helps, but the attitude is the most important part.     Tomboys are just fine, but traps will be always superior, even if the vocal minority says otherwise. Shota &gt;= traps &gt; damaged goods &gt; grills.     reverse trap tomboys     Shota &gt;= traps &gt; damaged goods &gt; grills.  This man knows what's up.      Beat Persona 4 Golden a few weeks ago   First time playing a Persona game, and first time playing a MegaTen game   Love Chie and her upbeat tomboyish attitude a cute appearance   Love Naoto and her calm, laid back demeanor and dat voice made of pure sex   Realize that it doesn't matter because fucking piece of shit Marie is the canon romance         futas   What if a tomboy fell in love with a trap?  Better yet, did we even have any series about this type of romance?     tomboys you sick dick craving fuck     Struggling to sauce these. Is the last one Adam in Puberty by any chance?      Literally what the link says fuckwit.     OP series is literally about a tomboy being pursued by two traps     Straight traps are awesome     Best tomboys wear spats  It is known    Since traps are literally homo, i'll go with the tomboy.    &gt;/lgbt/     K I want to see how this goes   Tomboys who want to be cute and girly are best    I still think this counts     Futas who act like traps or futas who act like tomboys?     Futas who act like traps     Looking back, Yukimura winning actually makes sense.    It's the best because they already are cute but don't realize it.    How delusional, you don't seem to realize that the vocal minority is those who like traps     Splash some water when your dick is in her and say that again      Posting Aichi with your shit taste  Fuck you.     Forgot pic      fujoshis last   And all is right with the world         trapfags   monsterfags   gyaru tier   Beautiful.  I'm not a big fan of tomboys but lolis are close enough to the top for this chart to satisfy me completely.           Has there been a good Fujoshi character?    Monkey.  Where is your god now?     Male Ranma doesn't look like a girl. (And better not to tempt anyone to start the discussion of where a dick inside Ranma's vagina would end up in that situation.)      Bio Suzuki, if anyone ever cared about her.    So /a/ would love a deredere loli tomboy oneesan? Does such a thing exist?    NEVER EVER    You gotta believe.      Traps are god tier.    No they're not.      Shotas* are god tier.      Reverse traps are.   Traps are love, traps are life.   MC actually cums in that.  That's a first.         I'm reading it precisely because of that. I knew something was up with that first kiss and losing the wizardry to the brown milf. The manga did not disappoint.  Now if only that disgusting tsundere was erased from existence it'd be 10/10.        I want to  use a double sided dildo to do ass to ass with Totsuka       BOTH!        I envy the mc like no other.  Aside from MC from prunus girl     Where did all these traps suddenly come from?  I can honestly say there are only 2 traps I've seen that I could gay to. Hideyoshi, and Saika. Bridget just never did it for me. In contrast, the tomboy list is much longer.   Everyone realized that they didn't mind fucking someone as long as they were effeminate, even if it had a dick, but Futa was too far into /d/ territory, so we went with traps.    I meant in the thread.     People with bad taste.    Tomboys are for gays who are afraid of admitting being gay.   Girly boys are the best. If you wouldn't love this tenderly and do your best to make it happy, you are a monster.    This. Hurry up and get out of the closet so you can advance to traps already.     tomboys being an intermediate step and not the very top   You're disgusting filth.     Where do girls who used to be boys fall in that scale?   Translated?   Remove traps    literally filthy peasants: the chart      my tastes are shit and I have no excuse: the comment     Tomboys don't have to go that far. I personally like my tomboys with a slight hint of soft femininity that takes over once they go full dere mode.   All day erry day  Tomboys look like boys, therefore only faggots can like them. Traps on the other hand look like girls and it is perfectly fine for a heterosexual man like myself to enjoy them.    Oh anon, you're so cute, just love a character because you love her/him. Gender  is a social construct  and doesn't matter.    The mental gymnastics you people are capable of.   Traps are boys, therefore only faggots can like them. Tomboys on the other hand are girls and it is perfectly fine for a heterosexual man like myself to enjoy them.    brown futanari tomboys   I don't care if it's a boy or a girl.    being this deluded   If you're attracted something despite, no because, it has a penis you are gay. That's all there is to it.      None Animu is shit and you too    Wait.  This still get scanned? i can't find any moreraws.     Ask any trap lover what it is that makes traps better than genuine girls and they'll always go back to the dick or say something gay like "they're boys so they know what boys want". Liking traps is gay.    they'll always go back to the dick or say something gay like "they're boys so they know what boys want"  I thought it was because they look more girly than real girls?     They got the best butts.    But how? You literally have no idea what a girl look like if you think that.  You don't want a girl. You want a boy that looks sort of like a girl.     Traps are practically girls.     come in a thread about tomboys   post about best butt   it's not tomboy   you are so wrong it hurts          Dress, frills, skirt, long hair?    No anon, that's not what makes a girl.  Hips, ass, breasts and facial features make a girl.     But the whole point of a trap is that they either have those features or has something close enough to resemble those features, thereby looking like a girl.    This, traps don't even have budding breasts which are the best.    No they don't. They have no breasts. Their ass and hips are nowhere near perfect. They aren't completely like a guy but not amazing either.     At least tomboys are female. Traps are just damn confusing and I don't swing toward dudes, no matter how girlish they look.      why do futa even need to choose when they can be both. they have 2 genitals   I think this thread is turning me away from traps and towards reverse traps.    What about tomboys who like other tomboys?   Straight traps fucked in the ass are even better    Reverse traps are like that pair of socks you get at Christmas but inside is a note telling you to look in the cupboard under the TV and inside is an N64.  Traps are like getting a PS2 for christmas but before you get top play it your parents get divorced and your dad takes the PS2 and pawns it.     Embrace it.     Tomboys who are insecure about their femininity  Would make her feel like a cute girl  Traps are wicked, tricksy and false.  They will cheat you, hurt you, lie.   Meanwhile tomboys are cute, fun and gap moe      Those are horrible.   Tomboys and reverse traps all day every day.   I see I'm not the only one with a fetish for fucking straight traps until they're cock-craving sluts.     No those are best because they spill their spaghetti if you call them cute    Tomboys and Traps are equal both with long hair please.    Let me fix it for you: Tomboys are the ugly socks what you never want to wear public. Traps are cute socks with penis.    Tomboys are not reverse traps anon.   What about a tomboy trap who wears spats under a cute frilly skirt?   But he's still a boy.    See if you take that exact same idea and just remove the penis and add a vagina how is that not a great improvement?

Dude your taste is shit.  PS: My captcha is cakes      She looks why too easy though, she looks like the sort of girl that would suck you off behind the 24/7 just for a pack of smokes and a can of energy drink.     just for a pack of smokes and a can of energy drink  I'd eat her out for the same things        Good to see y'all still fighting the good fight for Kaede. She would be proud of your efforts.       Oh, I'd make her proud of my efforts if you know what I mean.      implying she is that sort of girl   implying she isn't pure and innocent despite what outward appearances might so.  you people make me sick      Mysterious Eyes when?   Anything and everything for Mil@dy.    Of course. Kaede is worth fighting for.    When I finish kissing Kanade.    I have no problems with trashy gyaru Rina though If you think the idea of killing a Four Loko and a pack of Marlboros together on top of your roof as the sun sets doesn't sound romantic then she's not your kind of girl        I do have to wonder though of how far we can take theses interpretations of the idols without some form of sufficient evidence to back up said claims. One can say pure but the other can say trashy, how are we to know of which is the real truth and not just wishful thinking and bullshit?      Rina is the kind of girl that would take you behind or in restroom of a convenience store though.      Hugs and headpats for Rina.     Is she homeless?    No, but there is a homeless idol.     she likes going to convenience stores as a hobby   go in there and buy $100 worth of snacks and junk food  Sounds like an girl to please        Donate your blood to me, Syuko!    Eve Santaclaus     sells her blood for money   not selling her sweet ass for double  She could have been living the high life instead of sleeping rough for the first few months       Slipping that glass slipper on you Syuko.     Is she a slut? I like sluts.    h8, r8, deb8, or appreci8    What do you think?    Sae has cornered the kyoto enjo kosai market. there are no deep pocket big dick oji-sans to be had.    Anzu dead last  I like you         I feel guilty for finding this idea comfy and appealing Am I a bad person?     no, its just a very hipster kind of romantic    no it sounds comfy and like something straight out of the early 70s. do it for her do it for Rina    No slutty gyaru's are love. just dick them to the point that no other dick will do.     they didn't have four loko in the 70s m8 replace it with cocaine if you want to be era-appropriate  this also sounds fun, fuck       these Rinafags coming out of the woodwork  where have you all been hiding?    /a/ secretly loves sluts, myself included   Does Kaede like cosplay sex?   Yes. What's her back story?  I love listening to all the perverted stuff.        You wouldn't a mushroom    She's nuclear.   Thread has had a lack of delicious cake lately.    10/10 would put a ring on   This is hard since I dont even know who half the CG idols are, I still love my 765      you can check only the 765 box if you want, and core CG which are only the ones that got a single.    Is that a squid ring?    i think it is but it's the thought that counts   im starting to believe the mods are purposely giving us cake img captchas        Onion ring      you will never have a passionate lovemaking session with Rina on a hot summer night in her trailer while her dad's drunken himself asleep on the couch   you will never taste the drops of her sweat that drip from between her breasts mingle with the aftertaste of cheap whiskey on your tongue, both of you overheated from the lack of working A/C   you will never drive her to McDonald's afterwards so she can get some fries and a shake at 2 in the morning while dressed only in your oversized sweatshirt and some panties   you will never follow her outside after a cigarette and the teasing flash of her underwear while you wait for your order to be called out   you will never take her for round two right there in the parking lot   I've got all kinds of sadness I never knew existed inside me        Miku may usually act like a playful cat at work, but when she gets serious, she's not kitten around!   BAKA BABA    Just curious how long did it take for you to type that?    fuck you i didn't need this right now    all this hagposting  Hooray for dry, meat curtain covered pussies indeed.    Couple minutes   I like my sundaes with Chieri on top. Rerorerorero~   Pretty much just got into CG and probably iM@S as a whole. Those not in the anime's main cast I chose based off their appearance and their bio on Project iM@S, how did I do?    ...but ALL of those girls listed in that picture of yours have appeared in the anime.   With that said, I would say you have pretty good taste       damn...    Penus too low but other wise good.    I wanna marry Kaede; even though I know I'll be miserable when shes drunk; I still wanna take care of her.    Ugly, droopy eyes, pointy long face. What the fuck is with this particular hag?  Least she looks good.        tfw no Minamin to cuddle      Minami   hag  kek       hag  She is collage aged.     I meant the Cinderella Project, I had to read up on Sae, Karen and Akane and it turns out I like their quirks quite a lot. Anya is just perfect and Minami's parts in the last 2 episodes really made me like her so much more from just simply not minding her.   Post your favorite hag  that'll never get a voice.     You would never have a drunk sex with her on your wedding day.   Why live?       I know I'll be miserable when shes drunk   not working your alcohol tolerance to a level where you can carry her home after a night of carousing and spirits with your beloved   apply yourself!  img captcha booze          Pretty much a hag for all it matters.     RUMIIIII    i want to smash this trailer trash    still salty Rika's bellybutton was reduced to a vertical line in the show?    Very.   Rate, don't hate.   are her tits normally that big?   Why is this anime so good? I started a couple days ago after giving into curiosity from seeing the im@s themed skins in Ace Combat, and now I can't stop watching. I normally hate the genre of "cute girl(s) doing X" with a passion, but this seems to be the exception to the rule.  pic related is idolfu. Ami and Mami are a close second.      because most "cute girls doing cute things" anime are just moeblobs, while im@s still does it, they do it via better characterization and an ensemble cast that makes you want to care about the girls (at least one or two of them)   Why is Mio even the leader of New Gen?  Will they get disbanded?  PLEASE REMOVE MIO       Uzuki's the only worthwhile NG and she's going to crash and burn this next cour anyways Break up NG and the show is made better     Because Uzuki is an average clutz and Rin is a 2cool4u bitch. Hate Mio all you want but she's the life of NG     Because at this point in their personal histories:  Uzuki lacks self-confidence and a spinal vertebrae, and can only ganbarimasu. It's really only after Episode/NoMake 12 that you see she's starting to feel at ease with having finally become the idol she's always wanted to be.  Rin lacks drive and had yet to resolutely feel that becoming an idol will be something worthwhile for her to experience. Until the later episodes, she's really just been "along for the ride" so-to-speak.  That realistically leaves only one possible option for who their leader figure that can actively try to give direction to their assemblage could be.  Leadership in Imas is hardly ever painted with a static designation though. It's always about circumstance, like how Iori leads RK normally, but when the chips are down, we were shown that it's Azusa that takes charge of the situation.             Break up NG  Yes, please.     I want to bare back Nao with reckless abandon.  Then lick her eye brows.       Oh hey look      Two people do not make a triad.      they make something better  a Rin-free group      But 3's a crowd too.    But then where will Minami go?   I want to date the rookie.   Who is this semen demon OP?    With all the other girls Anya was in a unit with before getting ditched.      Where's my slut?  ;_;      Superior version here    I want to pet the shaved bit of her head and call her a good girl   Before any further Rin bullying ensues, some key points about Ayaka Fukuhara (Rin's Seiyuu) revealed in a recent interview:  - Rin was the only role she auditioned for - Her image of Rin was "someone who gets mistaken for a bad person" - She didn't feel like a 3D Rin until recently when she grew her hair out - The most important line for Rin from the first cour is when she says she enjoyed being an idol in episode 13 - Recordings for the anime series are done as a group, Fukuhara says it feels like being in a sports club or school band. The cast eats a lot of fried chicken on work days. - Even though Mio declared herself the leader, there will be times when other members of New Generations will be the leader, like when Mio was depressed and Uzuki became the leader. - All of Rin's lines are scripted, there is no ad-libbing. - She feels a lot of pressure when she sings solo and usually ends up crying. She likes group songs better because there are other people around her. - The CG cast started out distant but between concerts and anime recording, they have grown closer. - If she was a Producer, she would want to produce Anastasia and/or Minami. - Fukuhara wanted to be a dancer as a child and took dance lessons. Her first voice lessons occurred shortly before auditioning for Rin. - She spends her time off going to movies or museums or researching new roles, most recently reading the Arpeggio of Blue Steel manga for her role as Myouko. - Her favorite musician to listen to right now is Nagisa Kuroki.                 Are you a bait?   Showing more skin doesn't mean its much better muh niggah; but thanks for the pic. I'll save it.       Nigga, we don't hate the Seiyuu. We know how hellish and competitive the seiyuu world is and they have our admiration for fighting on in that environment.  That doesn't stop us from shitting on their roles and characters though.  Fukuhara is pretty cool, but Rin a shit. A SHIT.         She feels a lot of pressure when she sings solo and usually ends up crying. She likes group songs better because there are other people around her.   Fun fact: In a recent radio show, Fukuhara received fan feedback that they liked her singing. This knowledge almost brought her to tears.  So she really is insecure about her (admittedly subpar) singing.  Must suck for her considering that Scamco is selling Rin as Cinderella Chihaya.          Nice girls.     If she was a Producer, she would want to produce Anastasia and/or Minami.  Brilliant fucking taste      All of Rin's lines are scripted, there is no ad-libbing.   Wait, so does that mean SOME lines are ad-libbed?       Even though Mio declared herself the leader, there will be times when other members of New Generations will be the leader, like when Mio was depressed and Uzuki became the leader.   See, even Fukuhara acknowledges that when the chips are down and shit gets real, the real leader of NG is Uzuki.      I'd expect small things like Miku's nyas and Anya's Russian to be improv, the latter especially since Sumire probably knows more about Russian than the writers.   So is any idol a true semen demon is it just fan made opinions?    Pure?   Kek      I imagine the Seiyuu are given a degree of freedom and encouraged to touch up their lines and delivery during recording.   Meanwhile, Fukuhara just simply does things 100% by the book.      http://imgur.com/XHTAIsO I wanna sumo wrestle Kanako!     Fan made opinions mostly. The idols in the Cinderella Project are all dedicated to their Producer. A few of the girls however do fall deeply in love with the Producer which leads them to act like semen demons towards him.   Do you think will we ever get a background story about this semen demon in 2nd cour?   And some of them view him as a Grade-A plaything.    I really hope they take the Chieri crushing hard on Producer route for the Anime Incarnation of Chieri.  If there is a person in the Cinderella Project to be openly P-sexual, it's her.   Girl applies to be an idol, she finds success. That's about it.   Even in the source material, she isn't an idol carried by a backstory. Most of the depth of her character is integrated with her relationship with her imouto. So If Rika gets a starring episode, you can expect her to have a prominent role in it too.           That`s certainly true.    Is TakeP lucky or unlucky?    That's TheatreP  Although, TakeP most certainly is based on TheatreP.      Kanako is a yokozuna.   Is she a Mary Sue?   I want Koume to prank my dick.     Superior waifu coming through.     Translation never.    TakeP is lucky. Hopefully the anime expands on his supposed relationship with Kaede. I want to see more of her in the second course.    Kaede would never wink at you   Rin would never get jelly when you look at other girls.   Fuck why do God torture us?      Because God had TakeP as her Husubando.  She ain't taking no mortal wench as competition.      Yeah TakeP is lucky and I wanna see their relationship too.  PS: my captcha is cakes.       Chihiro   God   The madwoman has sent many a Producer's wallet into eternal damnation.  If anything, she's the devil herself.         You called?     PS: my captcha is cakes.   Funny. Me too but I keep getting an error.  Someone email moot about the broken captcha.       Friendly reminder that Mayu loves Producer the most.     She's Anna Stasia    No, remember that doujin when she went "sorry, no space for you" with the baby?    It's sad anon, but I don't think they have a past.    I don't think that a currently existing CG idol will ever be introduced as one of the Idols that left TakeP. They stand to radically alter the characters and aggravate fans of those CGs.  The former Cinderellas of TakeP will probably only be some anime only filler idols.     <br/>  Oh cool, they fixed the freaky fishface in the initial airing for the BDs.  Dooky looks extra Dorky and Cute.   Mio still looks like shit.       It barely looks better.    What do you call those? Granny panties?   Fuck you A-1.   Uzuki is supposed to look like a dorky little kid staring at a pretty poster and fantasizing about her own performance in that scene  I'd say the revision gets that airhead expression down without looking QUALITY.  Mio's expression is just neutral in general.        Bloomers   I wish I could marry Kaede.   This one?   As expected.    Marry Kaede   Gets assulted by drunk Kaede   Never; why live!      Sometimes I just can't pick one.  Mushrooms are adorable    posting little shits  Why?          Where do idols get their big talents from?    Post pure, cute idols.  P A S S I O N  PASSION!

Forever a virgin Mika        That's all I have translated.           I never realized that TakeP was so moé. Best producer             The poor man just wants to do his Goddamn Job in peace.  Bitches keep throwing themselves at him. He can't get a break.       Producer is the property of Rin Shibuya.   Realistically, TakeP would be Grade-A pussy bait.   Relatively high position in a major multimedia company   A personal office on the 30th floor of the main building in the compound of said major company   All the above entail a probably high salary   Tall person with bulky build   Deep husky voice   Generally passive and obedient personality   Jap women would kill for a boy toy like him.             So he's basically a fujoshit's wet dream?  That explains his popularity.   I don't blame them. The gap moe is too great. N-No homo.        Are the office girls also cakes?   I'm going to say no. But there needs to be more art of both of those girls. Especially Chihiro.    Thread is still up.  Excellent. Time to post more cake.     popularity   To put things into perspective, the guy has garnered 2700+ pixiv hits in his 6 month existence.  That's more hits than most anime characters ever get and these numbers alone make him more popular than 80% of all known Cinderella Girl Idols (Many of which existed for years before Producer ever did.)  And thats not even considering the artists who don't even bother putting their artwork on pixiv.   They're both 2X years old. Figure it out for yourself.              Cute    P makes the girls dreams come true, unless you are Mika's Producer, Mika really must not like her Producer          17 year old   bratty  An old hag like Mika isn't bratty anymore.      Anon your dreams will come true if you just get addicted to crystal meth. She'll be about 200 lbs. overweight and missing teeth, but you won't notice.       Calling Mika old hag   Dude are you 7?       In one of the elections. The other she beat Arisu by 34 places.     Kotori definitely is a cake, shes in her 20's already and she cant get a boyfriend because of how much a fujoshi she is, but I would date her, she is cute and quirky.  I dont have enough info on Chihiro to make a decision.     I want Mika to be my big sister     The fastest way to achieve it would be to marry her imouto. Would you?        His popularity is due to Gap Moe overkill and the fact that he has become the de facto face for the Producer of Cinderella Girls (Which as you know, has a fucking massive creative community.)  Artwork on his own merit as a character aside, he ends up being paired with alot of the other Cinderella Girl idols. Many of which, have eccentric personalities. And his rather deadpan demeanor makes him the perfect complement/tsukkomi to the loud and overbearing traits that most Cinderella Girl idols have.           Ninja Idol.

On the other, they can become used goods quicker. I'm going to have to go with imoutos on this one.    Well since I would usually say "neither" I'm going to create a situation where I am forced to choose.  If my mind were warped so that I would have to have a fetish for one of those two then I would choose Onee-chan.  You see I wouldn't trust myself influencing lesser minds than my own, that is known as corruption and unlike Kyousuke or Haru I am not comfortable with reaping the rewards of manipulation.  Onee-chans are older and more experienced. They're far more likely to be aware of what they're doing and able to bear the responsibility of their actions. So naturally the only acceptable answer would be Onee-chans.  They also tend to be tall, have long dark hair, and be on the busty side. So naturally they're more womanly as well which is far more desirable than undeveloped and tiny.

More?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127083444  You dont deserve those trips.    I love that him fingering his little sister's asshole was animated.  Thank you Japan.     Considering picking up this series just because of OP webm?  Good or bad idea?      look up source   find it   look it up in my list   dropped at ep1   Is it worth it guys?         Read the manga, faggot.     The show can't hold a candle to our based god Yabuki     yes, S1 is not that good tho, 2 and 3 are breddy gud    It's sixty odd episodes of ecchi romcom that consists mostly of Rito falling and landing exclusively in someone's breasts, ass, or thighs or wacky hijinks caused by Lala's inventions. Watch it if you have the time and feel you can put up with it.  Alternatively: Read the fucking manga, faggot.      Love this artist.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127085241   start watching halfway through the series   HURRRRR, who are all these characters?!      I don't think I've seen it explicitly mentioned, but some sibling doujins have siblings in their twenties.    Isn't she NBR to him? I only have a vague knowledge of this series.    yes, he is adopted.    Ah, so NBR then.     This is one of my favorite manga, but I couldn't get past episode 4 of season 1 and I tried watching it several times Try Season 2, it's more true to the manga.<br/>     imoutos   As a person who has older sisters I choose Imoutos.    She has the hips and thighs of a big teen already  I want to impregnate her so badly      As someone who has neither I choose both.    How is she so perfect?    at least the op was top tier    As someone who has both i choose neither       As someone who has both I choose imouto.  Nee-sans a shit, imoutos are love.         You a shit   Your sister can't help it if she's a bit older or younger than you.  You're just an asshole if you reject her based on that. Please fuck off if that's the case.     Nee-sans a shit.     ...and I came     I like to believe that you are a sister to someone and have a complex about being older or younger than them. Not fitting your brothers preferred.    As someone who as an imouto, I choose imouto.    As someone who is an imouto I choose oneesan    Is onee-chan closer to onii-chan or imouto?    I kinda want that frog backpack     What is faster than a kiss      your imouto will never look at you like that     degenerate    Oh I'd love to start some blogshit right now.    Don't judge me.    Imouto.    this    NBR       I just don't care for onee-san's in general. My general preference is for a submissive girl, regardless of age, but for some reason, even if the onee san is submissive, I just can't get into it.     It's a crime against humanity that she isn't in one of our beds right now.    Do you like tsundere imoutos who are only secretly submissive to their baka anikis?    hold on anonkun, when VR hits full force we can all mean up in the m/a/nsion online arm in arm with our waifus.      Mine specifically    Oneesan, only imoutos I like are Mikan and the one from amagami ss    Oh my....     middle child and all i have are sisters  they treat me like shit      lwhy there's always an asshole that thinks /a/ is his blog?     This, only imoutos O like is Mikan but that's because she acts like an oneesan half the time  Nice blog asshole       <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127090180  on /a/ it is    Because the world is full of retards, and sometimes they get in /a/     It's always funny to see the newest people acting like they're some sort of gatekeeper      disgusting otaku     Blogging is allowed when it's about incest. And 3DPD is encouraged if it's about your sister.    Stop it anon, you shouldn't be sexualizing your daughteru!   It's always funny to see the new people act like they're not new    Liza a hot.    New mods and janitors seem to say otherwise, a pity really.    She's not my daughteru and I'll sexualize her all I want     Blogging is allowed when it's about incest.  It's not, that two assholes like it doesn't mean it's okay  And 3DPD is encouraged if it's about your sister.  Again, its not       I've been warned because of incest blogshit multiple times already. You know like, she wore my shirt after a shower or, she grabbed me from behind to show me some move and I've felt het boobs on my back.      new   implying it was ever okay in the first palace      Try telling me what to do fag.    Stop being so bitter that you don't have any sister. Or stop being a monster without heart that can't enjoy the purest form of love.     You're the one that seems new to me. Do you want every Imouto thread to just be some image dump of Imoutos? You have to have some OC otherwise it is just a fucking circlejerk with pictures.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127090791   Incest   /b/   Please, incest is a pretty big thing in my chinese cartoon and weeb industry. Next time you will tell me that lolis are bad, right?       tfw I have an onee-san but she's a lesbian   Fucking /u/ ruining everything.    Incest is gross, otakus are gross, that's why they like it   Dick her straight.     Normalfags not welcome.     Why do you think it is gross?   Confirmed Mikan best imouto. And i thought nobody liked her, my dick is diamonds when i see her   He's probably american        I'm american and I want to fuck my sister.  I'm from the rural south though so I'm just a stereotype.     are you dumb? brothers are better in every way   Why are all imoutos silly in 3D?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127090791  /b/ incest threads are for shitty captioned pictures of 3D and fake greentext stories.    Not all of them   I want to make love with pineapple-tan   do it faget    Nope, the only people that like Mikan are onee-san fags and that's because Mikan is just a loli nee-san. Nee-sans a shit.    What the fuck does that even mean    She acts like a nee-san, not an imouto ergo she is just a loli nee-san, and nee-sans a shit should be self explanatory.    You're fucking retarded, you know that?   Always  <br/>    complying you have a sister     And you think /a/ ones are true? Fucking idiot     neesans   shit  What an idiot      That's my waifu, you piece of shit!    OHB wouldnt lie to us. A good end like he had is the only thing that keeps this godforgotten world from being consumed by darkness.    oh, look sisters thread   blogshit, people fighting over blogshit and newfags that don't even know TLR     I know TLR I just have no interest in harem shit.    Of course not, but /a/'s fake incest stories tend to be more than just &gt;slutty sister &gt;be me &gt;had sex.     I know TLR  You clearly not if you had to ask if it was good     Still not a n excuse to blogshit     not having read the manga     Isn't the manga still harem shit just more lewd?    お姉ちゃん    Just go and read it or shit the fuck up       I haven't read the manga     you seem to be confusing "occasionally tolerated/flying under the radar" with "allowed"    I suppose that's a more appropriate analogy.      What's the artist name?     I like it when they're as close in age as possible, twins preferably, but really I don't care. I can't get enough.  Truly the purest form of love     reverse-search, faggot.    That's the problem, I do reverse search and I get nothing    not google    I liked that one for some reason even if I'm not a fan of femdom.     implying iqdb ever gives you someth-  Son of a bitch it worked     you need to learn which service is appropriate for which kind of content   Listen up motherfuckers.  Imoutos are the best. That is all.     If you were going to pick up a series just because of that, then TLR is literally the series for you. Happy fapping, anon.    S1 is really slow and honestly just bad. S2 gets better, and darkness gets even better. You can honestly speedwatch a few episodes of S1 to get the characters down, then jump straight to S2.    Manga is good, anime is shit    Is that a shop, the have the exact same eyes.     No one has translated this yet     Unless all imoutos are Mikan, you're wrong    Except they don't.    No its not a shop, the anime implies that she's Shirou's imouto, who died in the fire. Also that would explain why Illya always mistakes him for Shirou in the mornings       Put you and your sister's name into the penis/vagina affinity analyzer and show your sister the results.      That outfit is far too sexy    I don't know if Kyousuke would let her outside in that.    Strictly for at home with him.    Worst. Girl.      Is this a Cirno thread now?    got any sadpanda links to them?    Same. Reality has proven to me that older sisters are shit so that may stem my bias and makes me wish I had a real imouto.      https://archive.moe/a/thread/126750<wbr>974/#126802854 Not sure if betacuck or gay </wbr>        You failed as a little brother, you failed hard.     Sora alone makes all imoutos best.      Sora   good  Pick one       Seeing as how Sora = good I pick Sora, always.     Sora doesn't even make up for Kirino. The record shows imoutos are still shit.     Now you're just shitposting anon, though this is expected since you are a nee-san fag, which are below even negroes in terms of intelligence.     Don't assume I'm 'pick one' anon. Sora wasn't very appealing in the anime, and as a whole doesn't counter the number of shitty imoutos throughout animu and mango.    Nah you're shitpoting. Only a shitposter would say this trash.    Sora a shit.    Only shitposters pretend that imoutos aren't vastly inferior to nee-sans.     Neat.    The correct word is "superior" anon, not inferior.         Most onee-sanfags don't even see the difference between NBR and Blood related which is utterly disgraceful.   Oneechan forever.   NBR, not a nee-san.    Nee-sans don't show up a lot in animu or mango, I take what I can get.    They're not sisters anon, you are simply deluding yourself.    Then they're not a true big sister, anon. They're just an older caretaker type female.    You're in desperate need of standards, anon.     Its nowhere near the same if its NBR. Not even close.      Christmas cakes are great too.    I don't go outside much.   I can see why a blood relation for imoutos tends to be necessary but is it the same for nee-sans? NBR imoutos tend to be tsunderes while NBR nee-sans tend to be childhood friends or keiki. I don't think blood relation is quite as essential for nee-sans but I would entertain some differing opinions on this matter.            She's plainly average an pesonality is unappealing, but the main problem is really the Sorafags. They always hijack imouto threads to blow up how important they are, but in reality, they're so few they YnS threads either die out of suffer from constant samefagging.    Then they aren't fucking onee-sans if they're not blood related. They're just extermely close people.     Blood relation isn't important for nee-sans but it's important for imoutos  It's either one or the other fuckface, you can't have separate standards for both. Fucking hell this is why nee-san fags are scum.      I didn't realize that Sora wasn't allowed in imouto threads. To think, she's not an imouto even though she's constantly referred to as such.      blood relation is essential to the whole thing. I'm not sure you're actually have the same interests, maybe you just like older childhood friends, like you said.     Twin sister who walks the line. Her fierce loyalty is her best feature and if she works on her faults she would be perfect.     Her entire arc is about her working on her faults and overcoming the most egregious ones. Unfortunately the anime glossed over this.     So the biological relation is what makes the archtype? Here I thought character traits were far more important.    I DO have seperate standards for both what are you gonna do about it? And look at you taking the highground, you wouldn't resort to namecalling would you.   I'm honestly an ara ara kind of guy, thanks for not calling me a fuckface.          Character traits don't make someone a sister, it is blood.    NBR nee-sans are trash. You are giving all nee-san fags a bad name.    Nee-san fags already gave themselves a bad name since 90% of the nee-sans they post are NBR. This is why we should stop including them in our threads.    You realize that imouto and onee-san refer to sisters, right? Not just girls that are younger/older than you.     4,5,11   M-Muh duck!     I find 12 to be the hottest.    But character traits make the archtype.   I just venture into these threads because of the nee-san/christmas cake overlap. They represent traits I like.   They also refer to a set of character traits portrayed in most anime and manga.          But that's not what we're talking about here. Learn to context.        <br/>        I agree. It just looks so affectionate and lovely.   Either. ;_;   Kirino please go and don't bother the pthwr imoutos. Kyousuke is waiting for you in bed.     other  Fuck me, that came out wrong.       Fuck off, you contrarian faggot.   Wrong, you idiot. We talk about Sora because no one posts any other fucking imoutos until hours later and we're keeping an incest thread alive.        4chan must be why my sister doesn't want my dick   scapegoat yuri like a faggot when your life isn't even fucking anime and manga     becuz i sed so         I noticed the thread turned into shit right about two hours ago, the moment they start posting.     Yea it's my fault, not the people shitposting.      implying kirino doesn't shitpost while laying in Kyousuke's bed with her bare ass hanging out the bottom of his old shirt        God damn that is a lewd ass figure.     The root of the problem is probably the degree of how obnoxious the fanbase is in general. A lot of people are turned off the moment you enter, because we don't want to associate with you. We figured out how obnoxious you are to other characters in yns, and we see how obnoxious you are to other sisters, especially older sisters, so it's kind of natural to connect the dots.       am i cool yet?   No, you're a tryhard hipster faggot.        Oh sure, all shitposting is me and totally no one else.  I'm not going to pretend I am 100% innocent but you really don't have any actual proof that any of what you are saying was done by me.        obnoxious to other characters in YnS    obnoxious to other sisters, especially nee-sans   Not even a whiteknight. You're full of fucking shit.       You've either never been into an yns thread to see how much they shit on nao, or you're in denial, refusing to see how much they've shat up this thread.     blame the anon getting shitposted, not the shitposters      They can be secretly, but it has to come out at some point.     It's not easy to make out.  Even shitposts against could in reality be mere retaliation to how much you shitposted in the past and maybe even well deserved. I'm not one to judge that. All I know is there's history between the two factors.        While I will be the first one to say that Nao is 3rd best girl, you aren't exactly doing her any favors by whining about some people hating her.     People, not including me, hate Nao for raping Haru and having the most boring route.  As soon as that anon posted about Sora alone being an example of how good imoutos are contrarian faggots got obnoxious and you're not going to attack them instead? Bullshit.      Did you even read the idiot post I replied to?  Are you simply denying that post exist and that my post came up from thin air?     Onee-sama all day every day   best girl    Because karma What comes around goes around.  People react to you negatively because you've behaved negatively.        I completely agree with the guy you were responding to though, you are full of shit. For some reason you have a problem with me or one of the other 4 Sora posters (probably me since I post the most) and now you are trying to construe the silly contrarian shitposting that has been happening since day one on 4chan, long before I ever started posting Sora mind you, as some kind of "karma" because I...post Sora which in your mind is some kind of unforgivable crime.      how much you shitposted in the past   First of all, faggot, I'm not either of those handful of Sora loving anons. In every thread I've seen them in I have never seen them doing anything but either post a little carelessly or properly defend her while posting plenty of images and occasionally amusing comments.     <br/>   Well, once you are ready to accept reality, you can come back to my post that explains where you went wrong.  The first step involves you to start behaving and stop throwing shit against other characters.      I should have realized eventually people were going to start more commonly being contrarian faggots even about a harmless girl and imouto like Sora with a civil enough fanbase.  I hope /v/ isn't leaking.       stop throwing shit against other characters   How about stop pulling shit out your ass and post some archive links if you feel so sure?      Your fanbase isn't civil Anon. Back when you had yns thread, it was full of shit slinging even back then.     I officially think this guy is a master baiter  heh   fucking hell I'm 27 and that can make me giggle  and he has effectively strung us along.  I shall stop responding or just go "K" to him like I do everyone else that's baiting, I suggest you do the same but hell that's up to you maybe you find his delusions fun.       You are anonymous. You don't have to defend your personal reputation because you don't have one. By trying to do so you are only shitting up the thread even more.    not even 300 posts   Merely a diversion.      Yea I've already come to that conclusion in      be onii-san   imouto is over 10 years younger   never see her as anything but a little kid       defending themselves is shitting up the thread   not the faggots making baseless claims       That simply means you will be more susceptible if you ever notice her womanly charms.     It was leaking for a while, I think. I remember sauce? posts in almost every fucking thread. Good thing that crap isn't all that welcome here.     You should do fun things with her.     Defending myself or whatever won't change the simpletons mind and all it does is give him more posts to air his madness and fewer posts dedicated to imoutos and the 3 BR nee-sans that actually exist.     Any idea what Meleefaggots do on /a/? I want more reasons to hate them.  Or do they just bitch about how the latest anime isn't the exact same as their favorite in the same genre regardless of its own merits?       dat webm     Same. Mine's cute though so it's okay. So long as she doesn't end up a bitch when she hits puberty, she'll be alright.   How many imoutos do you see here?  Has TLR taken any more steps towards the harem plan or was it just a shitty ruse after all?  I'm so sick of fake harems.      1 is the imouto of the MC, the other is the imouto of another character, the other two are boring.      Is this a trick question?  Three seems about right.       3 and one bitch that needs to die. Can you guess who is the bitch?     No, it's foreshadowing Miyu's brother is GOAT onii-chan     why do i live     So long as she doesn't end up a bitch when she hits puberty, she'll be alright.   Implying any girl doesn't become a bitch at that age.  I prey for you.       No one has translated this yet       You all missed best imouto.       NBR   not even inseki   WCW shit <br/>       No I mentioned her, she was in the boring category.      The two big girls looks so stupid, yet I can't stop wanting to fuck them.  I realise this would make imouto sad if I actually did this. I can only hope she grows up soon enough before the other two meat demons tempt me too much.      Who is the manliest aniki?   The sleepy aniki.    Kamina    Imouto.   I don't either so I like both, call me a tasteless faggot because I want everything.   *don't have      I think it's cute when brother and sister can't help but to have sex all the time.    But her ass isn't eve showing!    Isn't the Imouto a slut and the Onii-chan a faggot in that show?   My imouto used to be a precious one! Then boys and drugs entered her life. I want to rip the boys apart.    Thinking Len &amp; Rin are siblings    Onee-san i don't want to spoil someone, i want to be spoiled.   To be honest I wouldn't. I'd fuck a slightly older woman who plays that role however, that's the appeal for me.   As long as its Mikan not Kirino, im happy.  i want a suteki onee chan with a mio kind of personality  and then when she gets scared of lightning or something like that, i hear a knock on my door and she wants to climb into my bed  sho ga nai nee, nee chan        Onee-chans, of course.  They can step on you and berate you and you can't hit them back.       I'll never understand wanting to be dominated.    I'll never understand not wanting to be dominated.    Sounds like a beta thing, wanting to be controlled and abused.    Onee-chan x imouto    But those can't breed and impregnate.  It's better when it's brother and sister, two puzzle pieces who first each other.      checked    At least there a manga    I'm sure some yurifag would call you out on that.    Those people doesn't belong to /a/ though    Damn, I want that but options are either:  opened, "stained" on Mandarake   440GBP on Amazon       These two should just have sex already. They fit so well together. Like a T being inserted into a U.  I wouldn't fault anyone for wanting Mikan, no one would fault him for that.     &lt;-    stained  How stained is stained? Like somebody's cum made her shirt crusty stained?    You shouldn't really discard either. Lots of interesting combinations can be made from both older and younger.  Tsukihi is younger, but she's this sage at the same time. Albeit a bit inexperienced, she always has interesting advice, and fun to talk to and joke around with.  An older sister version would unlock her the super wise sage mode. I'd like to see something like this too actually.         Shit with a random whore.      Go away with your nbr.     It's always amazing when you can conquer an older girl in my opinion.  Since it's difficult as hell, the starts need to align, but it's so awesome when it happens.        These are completely irrelevant to this thread and serve as further proof of nee-san fags being plebs with no standards.     I feel sorry for True Oneesanfags that have to share a title with pretenders.    I think it's okay though. Sometimes when you're single child, you would need to settle for what you can get.  I don't mind adoptive older sisters.      Was it rape?    Starts fingering her   He's just pretending to be asleep, right?     There's a lot of hearts so I doubt it.  She's attacking him aggressively, but he can attack back at her weak part, with his penis, repeatedly.      He was clearly cowering in that tiny panel    Pretty much.  In the latest TLRD chapters, we actually had a title called "First accident", the first time something happened accidentally.  That means for all these years, Rito had been groping the girls very specifically and with intent, while pretending otherwise.          that pose  Gets me everytime     But why is she so peefect, /a/?     Perfect  I'm obviously not perfect like her.    Imouto for life   So all those "accidents" I see sometimes aren't accidents but him groping girls and getting away with it? What a louse.   Imouto, especially those with twintails and a touch of tsun.    yuri incest   It's shit. Keep them separate or you ruin both flavors, idiot.   It's better because brother and sister is just that fucking good while sistercest needs twins just to not be shit.         I can't really agree with you there.  Older sister and younger sister is better than same age any day. It's also more rare to succeed, because the older sibling is constantly tempted by other peers at its age and ever older peers. And this tempting will constantly happen over a long time before the younger sibling matures enough to be attractive to the older sibling.  That's why I think it's more miraculous when they succeed.         Okaa -chan    My issue is with the multiple taboos. It comes off less as romance and more tryhard in general.    It sucks more being in the middle with 9 sisters     tfw my sister became a super-bitch at puberty but then chilled out tremendously a few years later as if to apologize and now we're best bros   and she lets me see her in panties sometimes     I think there is also something very pure and romantic about older sister loving her little brother.  If she accepts him as her man even though he is still small and can't fully penetrate her yet, it requires something else, more extraordinary in their relationship.      Pretty much the exact same for me. She turned emo (literally) in middle school, but when she got older she stopped being edgy, and now we talk about comics and play video games and shit.   haven't seen her in panties, but basically everything else at this point        Fuck your sister already.      It always surprise me, /a/sisters seems to be the best girl of the bunch. They can be unbearably bitchy at times, but they're also bros and pure sex.    I'm trying         Good luck    All in good time.   Probably because everyone else decides they permanently hate their sisters the moment they enter the bitchy puberty phase.       This image always gets me.  the aroused face of the imouto   pantsu dangling from her left feet   pack of condoms on the pillow   wet spots from love juice on the sheets          Good luck  We already life partners anyway    Probably because everyone else decides they permanently hate their sisters the moment they enter the bitchy puberty phase.  And as said after that, their adult form is better because they're boner-inducing best bros.          I don't know if she wants it.   On any given day, she'll go from hanging out in my room in a t-shirt and pantsu or chilling on the couch with her feet practically on my penis, to randomly starting discussions about how some Swedish guy/Egyptian king/Game of Thrones character fucked their sister and how "That's totally disgusting." I don't know which hint I should be taking.        /a/     Looking back my Imouto dropped hints all the time that I only noticed after she become an angry SJW tumblrite. Proceed at your own discretion.    Imouto is the only way to wincest.    correct her with the D.         I don't know if she wants it.  Mah nigga      My relationship with my older sister is more or less like the one in that image. People with shitty family relations need to stop projecting.    tfw no imouto to pamper and spoil.   tfw you'll never have an imouto that'll cling to you   tfw you'll never get overprotective over your imouto    On the bright side I get money from time to time from my onee-sans and one of them is loli-sized        That is one puffy vulva     People with shitty family relations need to stop projecting.  It's just a matter of timing, really. At the very least, as a brother people has to stop being human thrash so the sisters wouldn't be ashamed.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127116238  It is literally written on the page   Nee-san. Everyone who disagrees with me is a terrorist.

I feel like there's not enough usage of 'Aneki'. Why?   Imouto vulva is always the puffiest.   Onee-chan  Glad, my imouto never touchs tumblr.   It's a mind poison that females seem highly susceptible to.    Saying no to a Miyuki Sawashiro Onee-chan   <a href="https://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1435102926569.webm" target="_blank">https://i.4cdn.org/wsg/143510292656<wbr>9.webm</wbr></a>     can't even cross-link     Because their logic is:   remember that math test you failed? Yeah, that was the patriarchy.   Everyone in puberty is highly susceptible to outside influence. Hell, ISIS makes it look easy.        that sound clip     I seem to remember that one of the AssCreed games has brother sister incest in it, and that imouto was watching me play when it happened. I don't think she had much of a reaction    Main Villain of Brotherhood did it with his sister I believe.    Is this from one of those yandere CDs, but with onee-chan theme?    But the closer in age they are the more they can play the "always been together" card that makes incest romance so great. Twins are the epitome of this. Identical twins are the highest form of "know you better than anyone" as well. And since I'm not a fujo, that means yuri twincest is the best.     &gt;But the closer in age they are the more they can play the "always been together"  That doesn't make any sense. A 12 year old sister and 11 year old brother have been together for 11 years. A 11 year old brother and an 11 year old sister have been together for 11 years. It doesn't fucking matter.   Identical twins  Sure if you're homo sexual.  I don't like identical twins, it doesn't appeal to me, I'm not gay.            You don't have a very good grasp of what "always" means, do you anon?    I'd do it with my sister if you know what I mean    My imoutos are unidentical twins. One is pure slut, literally hater her. The other one is quite bro.  Elaborate        Villains seem to screw their sisters a lot.     two older sisters   youngest and only boy   tfw I will never be an onii-chan to an imouto  It sucks being a complicated birth (breached-born ass first, with the umbilical cord wrapped around my neck) that made my mom decide 3 kids was enough.       what's wrong with her face?    I suppose game developers just love to feed normalfags with the feeling that they've done something good by punishing evil, since they think incest is evil and such.    And now look where you ended up. Posting in an imouto thread on 4chinchin.     It's okay to dream, right?  ;-;      want to have imouto  Believe me, it's not as great as you think.

She would break so easily if you pump into her and cum inside every day.    Her brother seems like a shit    You're only making me harder   How do siscons feel about your unreasonably attractive mother joining in on the sister loving?   Oka-sans are just onee-sans without the slim uncertainty of whether or not she's a slut. Good for a fap every now and then, but not for pure love.    Threesomes are disgusting and added with parent/child incest is just double whammy of disgusting.    Allahu akbar     Only if you do a piss-poor job of raising your imouto.

Having a harem consisting of your family is tricky but it could work.

Use the one with the fixed font    You're goddamn right it is    While I agree that the translated side doesn't have many a lot of the VNs on that list a piss poor and untranslated for a reason. I find that some cheap RPGmaker doujin games sometimes have better imouto material than cheap VNs.      I like orange background, it's the colour a Mikan has.    You still live in that delusion that all "the good VNs" are translated?  That's material shitty baiters on /vg/ use.   But no shit that some VNs are bad, that's true for every medium.       Saekano volume 8 is out. I'll be posting summaries and dumping pics. This is my first time doing a summary, so I wasn't really sure what was fine to omit and wasn't, so if you have any questions or anything to add, please do so.  I look forward to the return of our goddess.  First for best girl! The post before me doesn't count!      Eririfags desperate as always.   Just post everything you want to summary   So, Ak-kun   ...yeah   It's research, Aki-kun.    Research, huh. I guess we can't do much about it.    Yeah, we can't.   ...Don't let go.   As long as Aki-kun grips on tight, we'll be fine.           Forgot pic.      can't do much about it.   *it can't be helped     Thanks for doing a summary. I look forward to seeing what this volume is about.       Prologue   The novel starts with Tomoya, Michiru, and Izumi gathered in his room to celebrate the creation of their new circle. Michiru questions Tomoya on the state of the circle now that Eriri and Utaha have left. Tomoya doesn’t take being reminded of the two leaving very well, but Izumi reassures Tomoya by saying that she won’t let the circle die. The conversation takes a darker turn when Izumi talks about how she’ll make Tomoya forget about Eriri and eliminate her. Tomoya panics and tells her to stop making her character develop like that. Michiru comments that nothing could have been done about the two leaving. When Tomoya asks why, she responds by saying that the two had lost the fight for survival within the circle. At that moment, Megumi enters with the drinks, right when Michiru explains that Megumi had kicked the two out of the circle, using an analogy of someone’s wife delivering punishment. Megumi is displeased and tells them to stop making her seem like someone so mean, but everyone is visibly scared of her. They move on with the party. Megumi encourages Tomoya to do the toast. The prologue ends with everyone shouting kanpai.     Chapter 1   Tomoya is talking with his classmate Yoshihiko in the classroom. When he asks why Tomoya hasn’t updated his blog in a while, Tomoya says that he’s busy. Eriri comes over, greets them, and sits down. Yoshihiko tries to ask Tomoya if there is really nothing between him and Eriri, but he dodges the questions. Tomoya reminisces about how rumors had started after he and Eriri started regularly going to school together after winter comiket. He also comments how more rumors started when they seemed more distant to each other after spring break. Tomoya’s phone rings, and it turns out that Eriri had just messaged him about how his new game is coming along. He responds that things are going well, but Eriri doesn’t like his tone. She questions if he’s still holding a grudge. The conversation gets heated to the point where Eriri stops texting and just asks him out loud what was up with what happened between him and Utaha at the train station. There’s a bit of an awkward silence. After class, Eriri apologizes to Tomoya. Izumi shows up in the classroom with two of her classmates who want to join the circle. Eriri is against them joining, saying that amateurs and non-otaku shouldn’t join. Izumi counters by saying that Tomoya was an amateur at first too, and the two classmates reveal that they watch anime too. Eriri can’t think of anything else to say, so she storms out of the classroom while Tomoya takes the two classmates away to explain the circle. She meets Megumi as she exits. They have an awkward greeting and soon go their separate ways.        Yoshihiko   I miss that guy      Chapter 2   Tomoya meets Utaha as he leaves the school. She has him accompany her to a café. They talk about college, which Utaha says that she hasn’t gone to since it’s just orientation, and about the two classmates, who Utaha guesses didn’t join because Tomoya was overenthusiastic and scared them away. She turns out to be right on that one, and Tomoya. Utaha asks how Megumi is doing and says that Tomoya should keep an eye on her since, despite her appearance, she is actually quite dark inside. Tomoya asks her not to joke about that because he’s been worrying about that too. Utaha then asks Tomoya if he’s told Megumi that Utaha was his first and wonders how Megumi would react. She considers calling her on the phone right there, but Tomoya stops her exclaiming that it’s rude to call people in the middle of conversation. Next, Tomoya asks how Utaha’s work is coming along with Field’s Chronicle. She responds, “How should I answer? If I said that now was the most fulfilling part of my life in the passionate way you always speak, what would you do?” Tomoya says that he would wait in line in excitement for the game, which Utaha compares to NTR. They leave the café and talk as they walk while holding hands. Utaha encourages him to work hard for his circle, to which Tomoya replies that he’ll do his best and that one day they should gather together to discuss how their work is coming along.   (There were a lot of dirty jokes this chapter, and Tomoya notices that Utaha has been making more than usual, but some have been omitted because it would be way too long otherwise)     Were you somehow inspired by Spyro?    Chapter 3    Tomoya and Megumi are planning the schedule for the circle. Megumi is worried that the schedule might be too hard, but Tomoya reassures her that they have last year’s experience. She replies with how they had scheduling troubles even with Utaha and that artist by their side. Tomoya asks her why she properly referred to Utaha by name but not Eriri. Megumi is silent for a while before replying that it was just a mistake. Tomoya replies that there’s no way that’s the case because when she’s quiet like that for more than five seconds she’s scary. She explains that she never understood why Eriri quit the circle. Tomoya answers that doing so is probably just in a creator’s nature, though even he admits to not understanding what exactly that is. Their conversation is interrupted by Michiru, who turns out to have been there for a while and was just ignored. Megumi decides to go on a break while Michiru talks to Tomoya about how she wants him to set up more concerts and help make a CD. She pushes him down on the bed and begs him to help, but Megumi walks in on them. The scene shifts to them discussing who does what in the circle. Tomoya has too many roles and needs to quit some of them. Midway through discussing, Megumi falls asleep from exhaustion. When she wakes up, Michiru and Tomoya are playing a visual novel, with Michiru begging him to stop. The game turned out to be really awful. Michiru falls asleep on the bed while Megumi takes her turn at the game. Tomoya thanks her for working so hard but reminds her that, in the end, it’s just a game.     Chapter 4   Tomoya goes over to Izumi’s house. He has her look at the plans for the game and asks for her opinion. Instead of answering, Izumi asks him to leave her room. He goes to the living room where he has Iori look over the plans. Iori comments that it puts a lot of pressure on the artist since she has to match up to Eriri but also remarks that that’s probably not the reason Izumi had Tomoya leave. Izumi calls Tomoya back to her room to show her sketches of Meguri that she had drawn based off the plans. There were three sketches, one in Eriri’s style, one in her own style, and one that looked like Megumi. Tomoya also notices that scattered all around the room are other sketches of Meguri, with varying hairstyles and expressions, and thinks that these are all a hundred percent Meguri. Tomoya asks her if she’ll do the drawings, but she’s confused since she thought the whole point of the meeting was to fix the character design. Later, as Iori accompanies Tomoya to the station, he advises Tomoya to finish the sub-heroines first since he’d lose all motivation to write after finishing the main heroine.     Chapter 5   Eriri calls Tomoya on Skype asking if Megumi is in the room. He answers no and asks if she still hasn’t made up with Megumi yet. Seeing that she hasn’t, he recommends that she do it soon. Eriri asks him for help, but he refuses, saying that Megumi is scary when she’s angry. He tells her to face Megumi and talk to her seriously by herself. Their Skype conversation moves to Eriri venting about her coworkers and how hard her work is to Tomoya. When the conversation shifts to Tomoya talking about how good Izumi’s character design was, Eriri isn’t very enthusiastic. Tomoya asks if she’s still scared of Izumi, she says that you don’t suddenly grow just because you become a pro. Tomoya reassures her by saying that she’s grown a lot the past few months. That cheers Eriri up, and she asks him if he thinks her drawings are better than Izumi’s. As the circle representative, Tomoya refuses to comment. The conversation ends with Tomoya leaving since he has to get back to work.      Utaha asks how Megumi is doing and says that Tomoya should keep an eye on her since, despite her appearance, she is actually quite dark inside.   Oh man, her dark vindictive side is still there.      For a moment there I read Saikano. Then I remmebered Saikano. Then I got depressed.      Chapter 6   Tomoya and Megumi meet Iori at the café and have him look at the revised plan for the game since Tomoya wants him to be the manager of the circle. After looking at the plan, Iori refuses, saying that it won’t sell. When Tomoya asks him what he should do to fix that, Iori responds by saying that he has no idea. Megumi interrupts the conversation and says that what Iori is doing isn’t fair because he hasn’t given a reason why it won’t sell. Tomoya says that it’s fine and that they’ll go back and fix the plan. After setting up what day to meet with him again, Tomoya leaves, but Iori comments that Megumi is heavy. It turns out that she had fallen asleep.     Chapter 7   Tomoya and Megumi are having dinner at his house. Megumi has some doubts about whether they can trust Iori on this one, but Tomoya reassures her that when it comes to knowing whether or not something will sell, he is no match for him. They move on to fixing the plan. Several hours pass. Megumi asks the event where the heroine sees the MC off with a smile when he ditches her on a date for another girl but then gets angry once he’s gone is original or based on an experience. Tomoya claims no recollection for something like that. They keep working until two at night, but they still haven’t found anything wrong. They decide to go to sleep for the day. After waking up and eating breakfast, they continue to work but still have no idea. Megumi comments that all the heroines are done so well that it’s impossible to even tell who the main one is anymore which causes Tomoya to realize what’s wrong with the plan.     Chapter 8   Tomoya and Megumi are at the café with Iori. He congratulates them on realizing what was wrong and agrees to be the manager. Once everything is over, both pass out from exhaustion in the café. Later, Tomoya tells Megumi that they should go on a date to gather data for the Meguri route. Megumi suggests going to an amusement park, but Tomoya says no, the reason being that he had already been there for research for the previous game (in his mind, he adds that he went with Eriri). Eventually they settle for Rokutenba Mall. Like the previous time, they plan out what shops they are going to go to first. After shopping a bit, they get to the part with the escalator and the crowd. Just like last time, they hold hands to get through it. They reach the glasses shop, and Megumi suggests buying a new item to commemorate their date since the last one got taken by Eriri. Tomoya is against it because it’s too much like a yandere overwriting memories. She offers buying chains, a leather jacket, and nose piercings for an image change instead, to which Tomoya responds, “What kind of boyfriend are you trying to raise, main heroine!?” The scene switches to them at the food court. Megumi tells Tomoya about the time she met Eriri at the mall and how it sparked their friendship. Her face turns sad as she remembers how their friendship was broken. Seeing that, Tomoya asks if he should set the two up so that they could rebuild their friendship. Megumi responds by saying that it would be wrong to request that of Tomoya, but if Eriri is okay with it, then she’ll do it. Two hours pass, and they’re walking back home. Megumi decides to play the main heroine again and asks him to turn on the recorder.   (I’ll just translate the rest of the chapter and put it along the picture)     Rest of chapter 8   “I guess I’ll play the main heroine one last time.”   “Katou…?”   Just as were about to reach the top of the hill…   “Just for now, can you turn off the recorder?”   “Huh, why?”   After giving that strange request, she ran past me with a light dash and gazed back at me with a warm look, although, in truth, the evening sun made it so that I couldn’t really tell what expression she had.    “Hey, Aki-kun…no, Tomoya-kun.”   Even so, that voice and those words were enough to put that image in my mind.    “Do you remember? It’s been exactly a year since then.”   “Katou…”   Of course I remember. That was when I was fruitlessly racking my brain for ideas on the plot.    “Am I closer to the heroine of your story than I was a year ago?”   Back then, Katou was supposed to be at Hokkaido, but, unable to just stand by and watch me struggle, she prioritized me over her family and came back.    “Am I someone dependable?”   You were already someone dependable.    “And do you remember what happened about a month ago?”   “Hey, wait…”   Well…even if I wanted to forget, I couldn’t. After all, I was sobbing my eyes out right in front of Katou.    “Right now, I don’t have Eriri or Kasumigaoka-senpai with me anymore…”   Katou continued to talk to me in a tender, unchanging voice.    “Even so, am I still able to cheer you up?”   I wasn’t sure if I could get any more embarrassed.    “Am I someone needed by you and the circle?”   She kept on being my ideal heroine.                            everyone is scared of Megumi   I like the smell of drama in the making.     “As long as Katou…”   Today, Katou really was just like a jack-in-the box. She was flat, fun to hang out with, someone who didn’t even feel like the opposite gender. She had a sharp tongue, a dark side, yet she was also someone dear and sweet. She was delicate, sly, troublesome…   “…as long as Megumi is here, I feel like we’ll make it through, somehow.”   …and to top it all off, someone I could always rely on.    “So let’s make sure to have a great time. Let’s cough up blood together.”   It was a good thing the recorder was stopped. I don’t think I could hear such embarrassing lines again.    “Let’s give our best together, Tomoya-kun.”   “Uhh…”   “Together, with everyone else, we’ll make the best game ever, right?”   “Uhh…!”   Why did I stop the recorder? I’m an idiot.             I love you OP.   Iori actually asked if Megumi was depressed and hearing that, Megumi's eyes turned lifeless.    Epilogue   #1 Eriri and Tomoya are on skype. She is shocked that Iori joined the circle. After a few exchanges on how surprising that is, the conversation moves to Eriri being overworked. She complains how they pile one character after another. A bit later, Tomoya tells Eriri that she’ll have her meet Megumi sometime next week. As the conversation ends, he remarks to himself that he has to do something about his habit of calling Megumi by her first name since he nearly let it slip several times talking to Eriri.   #2 Tomoya and Utaha are on the phone. He tells her that the circle will be watching the livestream of the game she and Eriri are working on. Hearing that, Utaha tells him that the Eriri now is not the one he knew before and that he should try not to make enemies with her. She also says that she wants him, Izumi, and Megumi to accept Eriri as she is now.  #3 The circle watches the livestream. After flashing the characters of the game, it turns out that all the pictures shown in the preview come together to form one giant picture. Everyone in the circle is shocked to see such a great picture from Eriri. Izumi is visibly scared to compete with someone like that, and Megumi slips back to calling Tomoya “Aki-kun.” Tomoya notes that Megumi’s voice had the sadness and pain of being left behind by a best friend along with the frustration of not being understood by that friend.      not a single illustration of Utaha, not even in the cover or inlays  LELOUCH BTFO    Lelouch isn't even aware this is based on a LN.   OP you are da real MVP    Okay, thanks. I thought he was literally calling her heavy.      What are you smoking?     Megumi best girl. Tomoya agrees, don't bother him about it.     Caring about Lelouch   Unable to read  I can't tell which one makes you more retarded.     Will Tomoya be able to reverse this yandere in the making before it's too late?   Afterword:   Nothing really important beyond Maruto himself being surprised at how much screentime Megumi had this volume and dispelling rumors that Saekano was a split cour from the start (it got a S2 because it surpassed expectations).    That's all. Thanks everyone for reading my shitty prose and summaries that have probably left out one too many things.      Really really thank you, OP.     I know that he's the Yahariguy, but I don't visit the threads enough to see him.      Every volume needs tons of Megumi screen time.    How many volumes where adapted in the anime?    You know, the real bad thing that happened to Utaha was how irrelevant she became. Volume 8 highlighted it by making pretty every other line of hers a dirty joke because that's all she's good for at this point.     I never lost faith. Eriri is still the best.    That was the decision Utaha made in GS anyway.    Thank you for the summary, bro.   it got a S2 because it surpassed expectations   The series was literally blessed by a goddess.        For a moment I thought I was reading a translation of the chinks' summary for some reason.     tfw Izumi is more relevant than her now    Thanks, OP. You're alright.    The conversation takes a darker turn when Izumi talks about how she’ll make Tomoya forget about Eriri and eliminate her.    Tomoya will have to deal with two yanderes in the circle.     So yeah, if it wasn't obvious enough before, we're totally stuck on the Megumi route now. They're like a married couple at this point, they just need to realize it.   That's what Maruto promised.    The worst thing happened this volume to be honest. Megumi is still good but nowhere nearly as interesting as she was before.   Thanks OP. though I'm disappointed how MC just shrugged off the betrayal of those two bitches. At least be mad!  Maruto creates good plot and stories but crappy MCs. Tomoya is much worse than the WA2 MC.     The others never really stood a chance.     I dunno, I don't think she's changed so much as we're just seeing sides of her that we didn't before. Nothing before Volume 6 really made her mad, and there were the other heroines who took screentime away from her.      He's still a bit mad, at least to Eriri. He admits to still holding a grudge at the end of Chapter 5. The outburst in the classroom also made it pretty clear.     Why is the author surprised that megumi has a lot of screentime in this volume? Didn't he intended it to be this way?   Megumi is like spending days at his house at a time now      One and only.       He didn't.     I think it's like you don't realize the impact of something until you reread it.      She's the rival now. That means she'll be crushed someday.     Which actually made her really boring for me.    Thank god. MC is more human.   What does utaha mean that she was tomoya's first?    Kiss. Tomoya and Megumi are going to have a romantic moment, she'll ask if she's her first, Tomoya will awkwardly say no, and the mood will be ruined.     It feels that the author made her the winner way too early. However this is Maruto we're talking about, and probably this won't last much.   I'm fine with any development as long as Eriri doesn't take her place again.        Eriri got insanely close in volume 6. If it wasn't for her own stupidity, she would have won.     What volume and chapter did that happen?    Tomoya just says he and Eriri have gone back to their old ways.     Tomoya thanks her for working so hard but reminds her that, in the end, it’s just a game.  What the fuck has happened to Tomoya?     She'll losr because she isn't the destined main girl. But it doesn't mean one can't enjoy her shining brightly regardless.     Volume 7, epilogue. It's been spoiled in pretty much every thread since Saekano first aired.     It's just a game m8.     Megumi asks the event where the heroine sees the MC off with a smile when he ditches her on a date for another girl but then gets angry once he’s gone is original or based on an experience.   So Tomoya completely forgot that he ditched Megumi?        receive special treatment from MC   mend damaged relationship after years of being on bad terms   a volume later, shoot yourself in the foot and return back to square one again   Bravo Eriri, bravo.        Wait, why is any girl besides Utaha expected to win if she's both kissed the MC and is holding hands with him?  Eriri won. Utah went to college somewhere Kato is pissed at aki.  Basically sums up the ending here, boys       Poor Utaha is just grasping at straws at this point.     Her response was something like "...oh it's nothing, it must just be my imagination" but it was implied that she was a bit angry given the sarcastic tone.      Megumi is regularly staying the night at his house and makes him dinner.      They reach the glasses shop, and Megumi suggests buying a new item to commemorate their date since the last one got taken by Eriri. Tomoya is against it because it’s too much like a yandere overwriting memories.     The only thing Eriri will win is a consolation prize.    Yes, but their relationship seems very platonic    Showing Megumi's dark tendencies is like the point of vol 8.    Eriri will always be the best friend/staff Utaha will be always the idolized author nothing else. Itoko will always be Itoko Kouhai will always be the kouhai.  Megumi will always be the heroine.   Simple as that. Your generic tsundere will never win.          has any1 played the psvita game?    platonic   This entire volume is literally the beginning of a yandere possessive Megumi      Until I see a knife smeared with blood being held by megumi, I refuse to believe she's a yandere    It's shit.     It's quite funny, her dark side was initially blamed on her long hair, but she feels even more fearsome with short hair.      Izumi talks about how she’ll make Tomoya forget about Eriri and eliminate her     did they start going out ? I dont remember that    "It can't be helped since unlike VNs, LNs can only have one ending." - Maruto   So in white album 2 terms  Tomoya = Haruki Megumi = Ogiso Eriri = Kazusa  who won again there?         Not like she has any chance anyway.    VN =/= LN     No, the hand holding is just fanservice to please Utahafags who don't want to admit that their character is irrelevant now.     Maruto said he won't let another Setsuna happen so Megumi is pretty guaranteed to win.    Then what's this    Utaha then asks Tomoya if he’s told Megumi that Utaha was his first and wonders how Megumi would react      Why is everyone so scared of Megumi again?  Really the only characters that make sense to feel that way are Tomoya and Eriri.      My memory of White Album 2 is rusty, what does another Setsuna mean again?     That's mostly because she's depressed.     “Right now, I don’t have Eriri or Kasumigaoka-senpai with me anymore…”   Katou continued to talk to me in a tender, unchanging voice.    “Even so, am I still able to cheer you up?”   I wasn’t sure if I could get any more embarrassed.    “Am I someone needed by you and the circle?”   She kept on being my ideal heroine.   How can anyone think Megumi won't be the winner?           This is understandable. Maruto made Setsuna so unique and I guess he always thought of making her the winner. But the fans preferred Kazusa. It's like aquaplus forced him/her to make Kazusa the winner.    Is ponytail safe?     It was explained already, it just means kiss. It was part of the dirty joke since she said it out loud in the cafe.     Rinri-kun, have you seen Sawamura-san like this?  Have you ever seen her burning her life and enjoying drawing like this? You have probably never seen it... Because, had you known that she could be like this, Then you wouldn't have such insolent thoughts as to 'protect her'.   Ahh, really, what a waste.  And, I'm really glad. If you had seen her right now, You will surely fall in love with her again, and know the despair of not being able to reach her with that love.  Utaha's monologue in GS suggested Tomoya would fall for Eriri again after seeing her art. What happened?              It takes an Eririfag in denial to believe that.    There's a difference between ideal heroine and someone you actually want to be with.    Utaha will always be the teasing perverted character with the hot body and nothing else.  She was doomed from the start.    Jokes on you, Maruto intended Megumi as his redemption on Setsuna. It reflected on Tomoya's words in vol 2    Izumi so good, good thing she is my second favorite    He didn't see it at that precise moment.    I think the visually scared part is a gag scene    Anon, your analogy is really really bad. You compare romance drama and romance harem.     Tomoya is scared because of what happened at the auditorium in volume 7. As for everyone else, I think it's the aura she projects. Like, there's a scary silence.      What happened?  Eriri happened. I don't think I've ever seen another heroine as incompetent as Eriri.     Holy fuck I screwed up the green text so much    That's where she realized it's not about improving her art/skills after all. Even if she wanted to go back. The damage has already been done.     I don't see why Megumi can't be both.    basically a heroine that suffered endlessly in basically all routes, even the routes where she wins she suffers the most    why? Both were works of the same author and we are obviously going on the same route. Betrayal, ruining friendships and etc.    Best girl man    Both heroines won. It just that, narratively Kazusa end is more prominent in presence.   Utah's is the most genuine. All other girls are manipulative and fake.   the person in the middle here is setsuna     Both heroines won.  Yeah, no.    Is Megume slowly becoming Yandere or something?  Everyone is "scared of her"   Megumis "dark side"   That manipulative tone   Are all these things just things that are hard to translate and therefore something gets lost in the translation or is she going to kill Utaha, Eiri, Izumi and Michiru at the end of the LN?        wow this + handholding, and people say Utaha is non-existent now ?    Yeah I feel like she's the one far ahead of the other girls.    it's her character, anon-kun. those types never wins in a harem plot like this. It's always the long haired tsundere with no tits that always wins.     She realized after that. Even referencing Kazusa coming back in CC. It is all about improving her skill though.    What is Monogatari? Utaha is basically discount Senjougahara.    I don't think Maruto is boring enough of a writer to go for another WA2.    It was pretty bad, man. Setsuna never achieved her true happiness. Even in her "good" ending.  Worse, another girl will share the same fate as hers in another series.       It's more like she's someone you don't want to piss off. As long as you don't do something stupid, she's a perfectly nice girl.     was rooting for her until betrayal, now yandere the best.    Except she's the most mature one. Those never wins. She's the staple foxy mature girl.     She's 腹黑, a trait that would normally be associated with characters like Utaha, but not really ヤンデレ.    Don't reply to Yahari memecartel   I still can't figure out why /a/ likes Saekano.  When I watched it all it was was flagrant otaku pandering and fanservice. Not very interesting at all.     She gets pissed off quite easily now though.    Utaha reminds me a lot of yukinon from yahari and senj from monogatri. I think they are all considered kuuderes. Probably one of my favourite character type     /a/ is one person   Try mentioning saekano in a thread outside of this one      You mean eriri?   But that's his style. And it's heading that route.      Its going to be really hard to ever top Setsuna in the suffering heroine department.  Wataru is trying, but I doubt he would go as far as the CC Touma normal/true routes     Man I like how Tomoya is rather cool at handling Eriri and Utaha. It really shows that while he understands them he still has some troubles with them leaving the circle.   The anime adapted the worst parts of the novels so yeah.    Except that WA2 MC had loved Touma all the way through    Yeah no Maruto has done more things than just WA2 man.     She was flat, fun to hang out with, someone who didn’t even feel like the opposite gender. She had a sharp tongue, a dark side, yet she was also someone dear and sweet. She was delicate, sly, troublesome  MCs own words.     5 volumes where every scene is essential to the plot to a 12 episode anime is never a great idea.     You'll just get a bunch of "Megumi a best." It's all Saekano is known for. She really is the star of the show.      You know a show is bad when a girl like Megumi, whose main selling point is that she has no redeeming qualities, is the best.     Tomoya LOVED Eriri.    4 volumes actually and they weren't that good either.     it got a S2 because it surpassed expectations  And we all know who to thank for that.      Yeah, WA2 is an exception than a rule.     Sounds like he thinks if her as a friend, rather than romantically.     main selling point is that she has no redeeming qualities   I think you completely misunderstood this series.      They skipped Eriri's introduciton to Megumi and just introduced Utah and Eriri all together in the cafe.     Tomoya notes that Megumi’s voice had the sadness and pain of being left behind by a best friend along with the frustration of not being understood by that friend.   Catfight incoming?      She'll lose because she is a retard.    You don't get it. He never got over his love for Touma, but Tomoya has got over his love for Eriri    The otakufags who buy this shit?    Yeah it will probably be a major plot point from now on. How well or bad it goes down will seal Megumi and Eriri's fate.    Megumi X Eriri end confirmed    It's     You talking about me?     I think they did a great job adapting though. It didn't feel rushed or anything. Maruto has talent in anime, WA2 and Saekano are amazing.     Eririfags.    She's more than a friend to him though.     I still can't figure out why /a/ likes Saekano     Thank you for the summary. And well as an Utahafag there wasn't that much for me, but I still like it I hope Izumi beats eriri, as she is my second favorite      That's not the point.    This is gonna be some forced drama if it doesn't get resolved next volume.   Tomoya already said he set up a time for Megumi and Eriri to meet next week       Am I supposed to find these girls attractive?   Because I don't.       Saekano anime is not good at all.    Point is he loved Eriri like Haruki loves Kazusa. Which makes Eriri = Kazusa and Megumi = Ogiso. But Maruto said he won't let another Setsuna happen again. You do the math. But this is just my opinion.       A stubborn retard at that.    Have some ninjas then.    Saekano threads really could do without the whole WA2 thing.    You only have your own homosexuality to blame.     The anime could use better designs, but the LN is absolutely gorgeous.     It was not rushed but like the yahari anime only the important plots are included. The introdutions became flashbacks so much it was irritating.     It used to be   Saekano? You mean the guy who did White Album 2?   Now it's   White Album 2? You mean the guy who did Saekano?   Oh how the tables have changed.             At least the comparison makes sense here. Yahari threads can get aggravating with WA2.     not finding this attractive  That sounds like a personal problem to me anon, you might need to do some serious soul searching.     do you expect me to be able to read these kanji you nerd.    Still waiting on Taiyou no Ko.     I don't find Megumi attractive because I think Eriri is better.  That doesn't make me a homosexual.     Absolutely.   I wonder when Tomoya will find it strange that Megumi is at his house and making them dinner all the time   You may not be gay, but your shit taste still remains intact.     I don't find Megumi attractive because I think Eriri is better     He already does.    Welcome aboard brother!    Based Kurehito.     finding Eriri more attractive than Megumi  Preferences are preferences and all that, but I'm still kind of confused. Since you seem like one of the less toxic Eririfags mind explaining what exacltly makes her so attractive to you?  Personally I thought her design and personality somewhat generic, but that might just me getting really tired of the twin-tailed blond tsundere archetype.       As in typical MC's denseness or he finds it uncomfortable?     DFC twintails is a superior combination, tsundere notwithstanding.     He's probably like "This would be a flag event with any other girl"    and that's why she needs to lose, she had her chance she blew it now just waiting to see her suffer more    That cheers Eriri up, and she asks him if he thinks her drawings are better than Izumi’s. As the circle representative, Tomoya refuses to comment. The conversation ends with Tomoya leaving since he has to get back to work.  I thought Eriri was a professional now? How can she still be making shit comments like these?      She's still immature. Also read GS.     Eriri said it herself. You don't suddenly grow just because you're a pro.     manga spin-off ?     LN side story. Have fun.     Vol 7.5 really. Eriri went to Akane to improve her skills so she could keep her promise (draw better than everyone else) to Tomoya.    It pisses me off more how she was trying to stop Izumi's friends from joining Tomoya's circle. She's not even a member anymore and she should feel ashamed of forcing her shit views on things unrelated to her.    Having amateurs join the circle now is not a very good idea.    Not to mention that this leaves no room for the pathetic "baaawwww my girl should have won" bitching and moaning I see in every series where a girl like Eriri loses.    Implying Eriri was concerned about the circle.    That's not the point. She gets mad and storms out of the room.    Wait, are they going out? When did the started?    Nekofags can keep crying.    Nope and never. Read the whole thing before posting.     She gets mad and storms out of the room  Sums up her character pretty well.      You must be terrible at interacting with girls.     There was a girl who would always link arms with me while walking. I confessed to her.  Never again.      Kannafags, Minamifags, Sanafags, Zessicafags, Noefags and soon  Misakafags  too.    She was more concerned about the girls in her own way. She and Tomoya were both surprised to learn that the two girls openly admit they are otaku as well.   Izumi put her on the spot really. Tomoya was actually happy that he's seeing Eriri acting more honest though. But whatever, the summary is biased anyway.       Don't forget Yuifags.    It's more about who's saying those words. She abandoned the circle and still feels entitled to it in some way despite all the trouble she caused.    So tell me something, they replaced blessing software's artist?  How will that come across in the anime? Because Eriri's art was done by the novel artist, right? So they'll have to find someone else to do this new girl's drawings?       Eririfag   T-the summary was biased guys   Nah dude, she's just a shit       The anime probably won't get past volume 7. It's the perfect place to end it anyway.     the summary is biased anyway  0/10 Eririfags confirmed for coming from the bizarro dimension     Irohafags   I hope Megumi and Tomoya calling each other by their first names isn't a one time thing   That's why she asked Izumi if she would really drag her friends into this mess.     Considering how consistent the sales have been, I think they seriously might do more than a season 2.      the summary was biased   basing his evidence on the "biased" summary  Confirmation bias at its finest, I expected no less from Eririfags.      Season 2 up to Volume 7 with Volume 8 released as an OVA bundled with the BDs.  Make it happen Japan.      You know you might as well get yourself a trip denialfag. You do a pretty shit job of making yourself none recognizable.   I guess your retardation is just that pungent.    I was pretty surprised how well it did to be honest. Not that I'm complaining, but Saekano wasn't exactly all that mind blowing in my opinion.         I hope they call their first names in front of Eriri next volume.    I'd be more interested than a season 3 at that point. Volume 8 is just a set up volume     Volume 8 wouldn't work as an OVA since it ends on a cliffhanger. I'd prefer they just animate everything in a couple seasons. Like fuck, DxD got so many seasons, we deserve some too.    I wish someone would upload the rest of the CGs so I can get rid of these shitty youtube screenshots   At least she got told by Izumi.     Volume 8 wouldn't work as an OVA since it ends on a cliffhanger  Implying it's a problem.       What the fuck man, I'm not that guy In fact I was thinking of writing Yukinofags too      Aniplex seems to have taken a liking to Saekano. Like, holy shit, it got a S2 just a month after it ended, and it wasn't even a split cour.     But Yukino will (unfortunately) win.         In fact I was thinking of writing Yukinofags too  I believe you, but that is really not helping your case anon. The denialfag is a Yuifag after-all.     But I'm a Harunofag    The irony.    You like the best Yukinoshita, you're forgiven.    REMOVE HARUNO    Then all is forgiven, your taste is one I approve of.   And I'm an Irohafag       Nope. REMOVE YUKINO instead.   Thanks OP. Not to mention after reading the summary of the first chapter suddenly i feel really happy. Izumi is such a good girl.    wanting to eliminate Eriri from Tomoya's mind   She's great.      who do you like here?    It's a blessed series.   Is kato in love with the Bowl?   Back to Saekano, where you know that Megumi will(unfortunately) win   Now I am done with the summary, damn no mood for the full content now other than confirming certain truths    unfortunately     Not that I hate her or what. Even though she is interesting with rare main heroine characteristics and actually has no bad thing to talk about. But knowing my favourite heroine will mostly not gonna win still hurts Well if you are not winnerfag you will understand right?    Is Eriri still the worst girl?   Well depend on which side they choose respectively  Me?  Yeah I think so      My opinion, yes. That's why i love when Izumi actually confronts her.    Can't wait Izumi for kicking her ass hard enough that she can't stand up well    That's most likely not going to happen. The best Izumi could manage is probably perfect her own style. Maruto's basically been building Eriri as an incredible genius who's caught the eyes of the best of the best in the business.    And now she's a villain. Unless you don't mind seeing a betrayer who gone due to her poor confidence smiles at the end    I couldn't care less honestly, but why wouldn't there be a scenario where they all smile at the end? Tomoya and Iori were both amused by the irony of how their rivalry turned out in vol 7.    Iori reminds me of Hayato though, still Iori is better for me You know that Eriri's betrayal is lead by forceful approach (at least I found it quite negative by showing her better pictures) right? Tbh here's is the development I wished the most  Tomoya could found a way that's way better than forcing them that he did before, which resulting a better apporch and result compared to his rivals and manages to gain back Eriri and Utaha's trust so regroup becomes possible  Of course regroup is nice but better if they could at least kick Eriri's ass up hard 1st, so to remind her where she should be at Sweet revenge, to conclude Also, Eriri is cute when she's vulnerable          Yeah, she deserve some punishment. I remember a story which has similar scenario, forget what it is though. Other members start to punch the betrayer until they satisfied and become bros again afterwards.    It's Akane. Everything she does is forceful.    Check your history list, NOW!!!    Literally old Tomoya with better expertise    Are you guys looking forward to Classroom Crisis then?    Maruto needs to go back and finish 太陽の子 first. But he's working with his bff Takahiro so it will probably be shit.    I feel she's more like Tomoya, Eriri and Utaha rolled into one.   Well I read Saekano simply because the harem doesn't include "Giving MC fist, kick or any other harm due to any sort of fanservice or misunderstanding"(once you finish with something like Mayo Chiki ,Strike the Blood or Index you will know my feels) Also you can found  Daughter of rich family who is also a porn doujinshi author   Female writer of a school love comedy LN with harem made for male readers who wrote that to get praised by the person she like   Can't find such awesome characters at anywhere else        I got Tomoya and Utaha, but Eriri part beats me    Both are artists, both are/were mentally weak, both are childish (Akane is said to be a cruel child who became an adult without actually growing up).    Damn you are more into it than me. Time to reread it     Come on, in the epilogue fandisk, she's visibly happy, baby and all. She's even friends with Kazusa. Kazusa's side was so fucking corny whenever it involved her though.     thanks anon      Takahiro  is that the akame ga kill and majikoi, writer?    Why you people act like if Eriri did something horrible?  She did what she thought it was the best.     Yes.   Maruto man. He constantly shits on Eriri and wonders why she isn't popular.       Maruti did his part ages ago    Well he's a goner then.     太陽の子     Speaking of betrayal, Tomoya is also at fault for having poor management recently (cause he quitted using forceful approach by looking better solution and while he is still out of idea the management get worst by days)  Expecting a better management to get their trust back in part 2     And some people thought Izumi was going to join as a better artist than pro Eriri? Ha.    She'll catch up someday.     tfw irrelevant    Could it not be that Japan is just getting tired of generic-as-fuck tsunderes?    Poor girl, the most sincere of the bunch about her love and she is just condemned to friendzone.    Even worse, authorzoned.    The key is the management, which will alter the artist's potential. Even pro will run out of idea without proper management(vol 6-7)  Implying Tomaya is responsible for making Izumi better than Eriri  And we shall witness the magic      Really sad, my only consolation is that Eriri probably will be on the same boat.    Eriri deserves it. Utaha not so much, but she still fucked up.  They should learn from Megumi and just build it slow and steady, no rushes, letting the other competitors destroy themselves.        Tomoya is also at fault for having poor management recently   recently  Tomoya is always bad at everything. That's part of the package.      I'm pretty sure Looseboy is the key factor holding the project back.     Eriri has always been closer to Tomoya than Utaha. She gets more special treatment.     Eriri losing is rather pathetic with all the advantage she has had over the othet girls. Now she's like a third wheel, the lowest position in a romantic story.    I disagree, I think Eriri and Utaha act their respective archetypes pretty straight most of the time. There's not much that makes them stand out from their peers.     the lowest position in a romantic story.  The lowest one is being in love with a guy while not being the love interest AND having some male orbiter around you. That's a death sentence.       probably  Too bad that's wishful thinking for you. Eriri is set as Megumi's rival and friendship that needs to be reconciled, so she will be relevant for a while. Utaha also wants to look out for Eriri, so she wil serve to give Utaha some relevance because of that.      Well, they're better done than most other characters of their archetype. Eriri is more tolerable than most tsundere. I don't think kuudere senpai characters are even that common in anime.     What the hell are you talking about? Eriri is the main rival and is a love interest who was once the closest girl to the MC.Even now she has special treatment that makes other girls jealousy.   Will over look the fact ahe will never obtain the main girl position no matter what so she cannot win  Derp.      UBW is selling great numbers, and there are three tsunderes in the main cast.    Are you an anti-tsunfag or something? Most tsundere are endearing and nice. Eriri is better than many though. Harsh or venomous kuudere are common. A senpai type are less common, though the same could be said for tsundere childhood friends.    You're seriously replying to such obvious bait? Even LN poll have crazy strong tsundere force in top 10 polls.  And if anyone is getting crapped on by the author, It's Utaha more than anyone. She never had a chance and still remains dead last.      Kinda agree with this, i remember nice LNfag from several thread before this one tried to clear the bait by explaining how special Eriri to Tomoya and how this can affect his choice in vol 6. It turned out bad for Tomoya, but still, what he did was understandable.     Utaha not so much, but she still fucked up.  why ? animefagonly there      Being dragged to ReR because Eriri couldn't go alone   Being forced to inform Tomoya simply because Eriri can't   Being Eriri's babysitter no matter how I look at it  Those're true but  Being happy to see her drawing gets better  As an Utahafag I am feeling complicated now         Will he ever learn to be softer to everyone? I mean, not everyone is like Megumi, who seems to be the only 1 on Earth that can listen to him well. Thought he's really changing until vol.8....WTF?     Honestly, Utaha never had a chance, so there wasn't anything to fuck up. Too much author worship.      &gt;&gt;/Animesuki/      The girl who get the first kiss of Tomoya   The girl who loves Tomoya (vol 7)   Eriri got BTFO and Megumi is just the best example of heroine   Utaha still the most important girl for tomoya on vol 8   Still being delusional you retarded only animefag.         Forgot, Tomoya loves her too confirmed on volume 7.     so she will be relevant for a while  I was talking about the romance aspect of their relationship, nothing wrong with her having some relevance and them getting closer again, but it would be hard to swallow her winning after all the shit she did.     And despite all that, she won't ever get Tomoya. She's even out of the drama beyond friend and bystander.      He only said that he admired her. That was the conversation where he admits that Eriri was his first love.      Delusional Utahafag   Just stop.      Nop, the text on volume 7 is explicit. He said he loves Utaha but he admires her too and he's not too sure about doing something else (coward) and that's why he didn't say anything. This is the reason why Utaha at the end kiss him and Eriri got shocked.  Utaha and Tomoya are in love, deal with the facts from the novel.     Oh boy here we go. Time to leave.    Posting literal info from the LN   Call him utahafag      Based on what I describe, I mean that such characters might as well not exist in anywhere around reality  Reminds me of 1 of my female friends that dislike harem simply because she doesn't feel like it, applicable to most girls      Eriri was Tomoya's first love when both were kids, actually he is in love with Utaha. Read the LN retard.    Are otaku usually being like this or I am not 1 of them?       Who fucking cares, it will be yandere end.          Please quote the text from the LN that says that he's in love with Utaha. I'd really love to see it.      Posting shitty manga   Not posting the literal text of the LN or at least the summary aviable   Keep deluding retard, facts &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your delusions.        Consider Eriri and Utaha as his no.1   Never mentioned he loves any of them   If Tomoya ever loves Utaha, that's only after that kiss   Unless translation go wrong        Step 1: learn to use google Step 2: stop begging for spoonfeeding on /a/ Step 3: go back to /animesuki/      Right so you can't.     He can't  Delusional Utahafag.     Volume 4 or 5 if I can remember properly Tomoya mentally said he was in love of Eriri in the past but she changes in a way he doesn't like it so that feeling vanished. On volume 7 he assume his love for Utaha and confess to her  but he choose to be alone cuz he's a fag.   Also he was the one who said Megumi (at least for now, considering vol 8 too) is the perfect heroine for his game and a really good friend, nothing more than that.  Is funny how faggots and shippers try too hard to mix the facts from the LN just because their retardation and delusions are too strong.         google   I can't google something that doesn't exist.        Trying to bait to get spoonfeeding   Keep going retards, your retardation os going all out even when the page with translations is just at one click.       Sudden influx for Utaha  Is reddit invading us now?     Not knows how to read moon   Retard.      Sometimes summary just wouldn't be enough to express everything in details, I will just wait for translation 1st for full content straight away Also  Eriri = Tomoya's 1st love  Mind anyone to tell me where can I refer that? Cuz I have problem recalled that       Yeah I don't think so, or the 2ch threads would have more Utaha posts in them   Utaha is the third wheel to Megumi and Eriri.    Volume 7 when Megumi stays over. It was in a summary.      2ch thread   using the japanese version of /a/   Thanks you already confirmed how retarded you are, also incompetent nigger who cant use fucking google.       "I see...Eriri would say such cute things when she's with Aki-kun." "...Spare me please, hearing that kinda makes me want to die." "Aki-kun still likes Eriri after all." "I like Kato too! I like you even more today!" "Ahh, yeah yeah, I understand that you are embarrassed but there's no need to react like that right now." "Wuh, uguu..." "That reminds me...we've have talked about it before, Eriri was Aki-kun's first love right?" "W-well...as childhood friends, she's definitely special to me." "...Gives me goose bumps hearing that coming from Aki-kun. Though I'm not sure what kind of emotion made me feel that way." "You know though, Kato! You actually know, don't you?!"  "Kasumigaoka-senpai's graduated, hasn't she?" "...Yeah." "Aren't you going to confess to her?" "You've been asking a lot of messed up questions for quite a while, you know?" "You admire her though, don't you?" "...It's impossible not to admire someone like her, don't you think?" "...You do know that's the side of Kasumigaoka-senpai that she only shows to Aki-kun right?" "...A little yeah, I think I know." "...If you knew, do you still think your attitude towards her is right?" "Go to sleep already." ...Seriously, what's going on? Have you been accumulating a lot of stress every day, Kato? Or rather it's mostly the cumulative stress from the past two months, which means it's all my fault, doesn't it? I'm sorry.  Go read the comments in the volume 7 summary                             It's here  Eriri is his first love, but not anymore, she's still special. He admires Utaha. And Kato sees through all that and acts like she does.        It's funny, everybody assumed that Utaha and Eriri would be the main rivalry at first.     7     This is what Utahafags have resorted to   Remember when they would just post images and admire her without starting shit?       Posting random illustration   not knowing the context of the image   Yeah megumifags are the most retarded ones of this shitty fanbase.        Let them vent a bit, their girl got reduced to a side character.     4 is Michiru arc, 5 is Utaha arc, or you meant 3? Also he didnt say anything regarding his feeling at epilogue 7, or is it at other chapter? Or maybe translation really go wrong, I believe If you read vol.8 that means Tomoya still has no feeling for Megumi (that might sounds like bait if it's true, based on the title)       Yeah my bad was Eriri arc when he said that, on volume 7 before Utaha kiss him is the scene when he confess his love and admiration to her and why he doesn't say that before.   Also yes, even on volume 8 Megumi stay as a good friend for him, zero feelings for now.      Well if you do read vol.8 it's still Tomoya's perspective right? Mind explain the "holding hand with Utaha" thing?     Tomoya keeps the idea of "Utaha a goddess" and "muh admiration" and he feels like he's not the right guy for some awesome person (this is how he feels) but in the end he still loves Utaha and that's why she still the only girl getting those interactions with Tomoya.   For example, the dirty jokes, Utaha being jealous, the hand-holding, the kiss, etc. Volume 8 is more or less something to start the second cour of Saekano (and a new beginning for everyone), as Maruto said this was all planned.      /a/ is about the only place where Eririfags are vocal. I don't know whatever happened to the fanbase though, it's rare to see your average tsundere being the least popular.     nice LNfag  You mean your fellow Eririfag with his wishful thinking?      Eriri isn't bad, it's just that all the other girls are better. Megumi has a crushing majority everywhere.     Can't wait for the full content translated But in my dense view everything might go wrong So I will take it as "both of them currently are in relationship", is it correct?      Almost forgot to tell that usually her dirty jokes aren't meant to be jokes(FD 5.3)    You can say that, is like a relationship without a name.   Too lazy to read the thread. Just tell me this, who's winning?    Relationship without a name  That means Tomoya didnt mention anything much about that(correct me if wrong) So why they holding hand then? To fulfill 1-sided wish?      Read the thread.     Megumi by a landslide.     According to Utahafags: Utaha According to Megumifags: Megumi     Utaha is winning according to our trusty nip reader here    Both wants to be together, the problem is Tomoya's retardation (explained before). They are dating but is something between them and isn't public yet (only Eriri knows that, Megumi still in the darkness about that).      People who can't read the novel or use google    Someone who get the deal.        According to the thread Utaha is simultaneously dead last and winning.     No can seriously think Utaha is winning when she outright said "I give up" in volume 7.      Eriri knows but isn't going batshit insane   That's bullshit but I believe it       In not-so-private engagement, Megumi still has no idea cause of Tomoya   Implying something is wrong with Tomoya's perspective on Megumi   Mostly let Megumi know about engagement = instant break up  Just my doubt And if that's true......too many things to say        You're on /a/ where retards try to push their delusions over the main source, the LN is pretty clear about the relationships and volume 8 confirmed my words about Utaha/eriri/megumi.    The problem with Megumi is not something related to love or shit like that, on previous volumes specially when she leaves the group thanks to Eriri and her sickness, Utaha started to get some apprehension toward Megumi, same as Eriri who was more or less Megumi's friend.   Tomoya avoids telling the truth to Megumi because he don't knows how she's going to react at his relationship with Utaha, you can see that on chapter 2 volume 8. Eriri just get the deal and now acts as Tomoya's friend without getting some conversations with Megumi about what's going on.      Being dead last in Saekano counts as winning. All the girls can do way better than an obnoxious untalented hetare sperglord.    Utaha is currently winning  This confirms that no matter who win, she'll lose at the end of this story.     Other places outside /a/ have worse taste  This is not news.     Megumi &gt; Eriri &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Utaha  Utaha technically isn't even in the race anymore.       Utaha technically isn't even in the race anymore.   Having a relationship with Tomoya in volume 8   Not reading the LN    Being this delusional   Megumifags can't deal with the fact she nothing but Tomoya's friend.        This has to be a falseflagger for Utaha.    Even as a Utahafag, I'm not believing this shit when the OP and main summary blog doesn't mention anything like this.  But most of all 2ch hasn't exploded with Utaha posts yet.        No shit, even if you only read a summary for volume 7 you'd see that she's out of the race. You can't get more clear than "I give up."         So basically Megumi is winning by a landslide while Utaha is simultaneously giving up and having a relationship with Tomoya while also being technically out of the race?  Good thing Eriri is losing in every version of fact though.           Believing delusions of megumifags    Not reading the true spoilers/summaries/translations      It's like people can't understand what Tomoya feels about Utaha. He admires her too much to start a relationship with her.    I still think Eriri is the result of God personally teaching Kurehito how to draw the perfect body with all the moe points on it, but her personality is simple awful. Utaha and Megumi are far more mature than her at this point.    Might as well read this in a different way from now on Main heroine who might not even join in the competition.....now that's new to me Also havent read vol.8(mentioned) so I expect Tomoya and Eriri's relationship are just like vol.1-5, is it correct? At least I know both Eriri and Megumi are trying to recover back their friendship  Also is the relationship regarding Tomoya and Utaha is genuine despite the private part?       Truly a deconstruction of the harem genre. Bravo Maruto.    Oh get over it. Utaha gave up and is more of a teasing friend than anything else at this point. Her route is cut-off. She's the big sister to the girls now.    Maruto  Explding Megumi just because fans like it   Volume 6-7-8  Megumi is just Tomoya's friend   Utaha and Tomoya are in love, she get his first kiss   Dating on vol 8    2chan is basically the japanese version of /a/ with less retardation, but they still japanese than that means shit taste and delusions even harder than the ones on /a/. Facts are facts, you can't go against that even when the LN is clear about that.             the perfect body   About that.      Poor girl, the sad part is that Maruto has written a far better blonde twintails childhood friend who was also the most popular girl.    Arguments based on the LN &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your retarded opinion just because you like Megumi.  DEAL WITH IT.      :^)     Arguments based on the LN   I ADMIRE HER   ADMIRE   NOT LOVE   ADMIRE         Why so mad?    Eriri is 120% cute and protect worthy, which is something even Utaha would agree on. Your post is denied.   Here are the results for 6/24 releases  BD:  3. SAO II v9 5. Yahari 2 v1 6. Shigatsu v5 7.

I don't think people expected it to be quite that horrible. Not great yeah, but it practically went out of it's way to be the next Guilty Crown if anything.      Precure thread     Manami Toyota is fucking awesome.    My nigga    harmony power    Are each of the Cures supposed to have a certain Princess theme to them with Scarlet being Eastern/Chinese? I suppose Flora is the fairytale European Princess and Mermaid looks Arabian, what is Twinkle supposed to be?      this is a servant   Explain me something /a/, how the fuck this thing qualifies as a servant, how powerful it really is?     Wait for Heaven's Feel.   ITT: Manga you wish had anime   also this      I would need a change of pants if HOLYLAND ever got an anime but it finished years ago so it literally has no chance.    This would be amazing    I love it, but it seems the translation group is kinda slow, right? Well, better slow than not translated.    Did this character have any purpose other than being typical evil fujobait? I just finished it and he made no sense at all despite all the wasted screentime. He didn't even contribute to anything as everything he did was a waste.   And guess how a dunce like Crouton figured it out? Oh right.   I want these shitposters to go away.  Stop shitting on the dead corpse of a show. You are not making a point, you are not changing the opinions of Slaine's fans, you are just circlejerking.  It was a bad show, leave it dead. You are just embarrassing yourself with all these bait posts and lost arguments.       It ended with him smiling and having his pupils back. The ending with the three birds flying were meant to be symbolic of the three of them reuniting and flying together one day.  "Fragments of the Rain" addresses the matter of the real Slaine and how he'll keep flying low for now until his wings are dry. Both the princess and Inaho are waiting for his improvement.      You sound disappointed, here's a reply to make you feel better.    Because he saw that Femianne's Kat was destroyed and he assumed only someone with Aldnoah could do this.  Did you watch the episode?   </blockquote>]
