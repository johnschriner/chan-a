HE'S SLOW!   <br> Class say hello to our new transfer student. Please introduce yourself. <br> Hey you're that girl I met this morning. Hello. <br> Oh hi! What a funny coincidence. </br></br></br>   Who wouldn't want an old lady like me?    Both of my parents are alive and I live with with them   <br> transfer student <br> American <br> doesn't have blue eyes and blond hair </br></br></br>  <br> the transfer student is foreign <br> she isn't some tiny loli and instead is much taller than everyone else including the boys </br></br>   Not having Brandish as your new waifu <br><br>She just casually made everyone shit their pants, and left. Somethings up with Natsu, that bandage is hiding something.</br></br>  <br>I think he has a daughter.</br>  <br>Well I thought it was pretty GOAT in that I never expected it, but it's a shame he probably won't play HORSE with Erza.</br>  <br>Good for Mashima, he really does put in a lot of effort for Fairy Tail</br>  <br>I really wanted to write a lenghty post but I'll just post this (pre-timeskip) :<br><br>Zeref = Acnologia &gt; Mard Geer = Gildartz &gt; Precht (Hades) &gt; Makarov &gt; Four Gods of Ishghar &gt; Natsu = Gray = Laxus = Jellal &gt; Jura &gt; everyone else<br><br><br>Post timeskip Jura rose from 10th Wizard Saint to 5th position, and Natsu powered up with training as well along with Gray.<br><br>With the top 5 Wizard Saints confirmed, and God Serena having just betrayed Ishgar to join the Spriggan 12. Makarov is most likely the 6th in ranking. <br><br>Without a doubt Natsu and maybe Gray should be his level by now. So Brandish bitch provoking such a shaking feeling in his arm is probably because Natsu found an equal, not someone who is too far above his level.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's literally only because of "muh powerlevel". They were commenting more on "wow her magic feels really strong it's so strong can't you just feel it look how strong" more than they cared about her showing off her dumb gimmick.<br><br>The powerlevel shit going on is weird for this arc because A) the new bunch of mooks are all supposed to be on the same level as the strongest mage in their country so you're going to be super disappointed when it turns out that's a fucking lie and what's his face mage from their country blows them all out of the fucking water or post double timeskip A Team (and B Team) is on par with the strongest mage from their land at whcih point who fucking cares about that ranking then.<br><br>Also the big thing was supposed to be that the empire had more fucking mage guilds than their country so they were fucked but that's being ignored for "look at these 12 strong guys ignore the mooks please".</br></br></br></br></br>  God tier:<br>Akagami no Shirayukihime <br>Jitsu wa Watashi wa <br><br>Great tier:<br>Aoharu x Kikanjuu <br>Durarara <br>Gate<br>Ranpo Kitan<br>Ushio no Tora<br><br>Good tier:<br>Charlotte <br>Gatchaman Insight<br>Rockka no Yuusha<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127692724#p127692724">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>From the first episode it seems that way. I'm not really up to speed on the season yet, but as far as first episodes go this one seems good. The main character is really interesting because he's a fucking asshole who gets BTFO immediately. I already suspect they'll completely abandon that characterization however. If they hold onto it and keep him interesting I'm along for the ride. The setup seems interesting as well. I'm sure there will be standard romance subplot, but the show has a bunch of other stuff going for it so far.</br>  <br>i'm not that guy but wtf are you even saying</br>  <br>Went and took the time to go add the shit that hasn't aired yet.</br>  <br>Can you honestly blame them, though? I am so sick to death of the same generic shlock over and over again.</br>  <br><br><br>But the Key guy writes the scenario, right?</br></br></br>  What am I in for /a/?  <br>Yeah, the proper release was properly done, but there are still tons of misnamed uploads out there that weren't corrected or taken down.<br>Especially on youtube.</br></br>  <br>I don't like reading shit I've already seen.</br>  <br>You will probably find yourself swamped by stuff you wouldn't know unless you read the first two volumes then.</br>  <br>Not necessarily. You can start straight from 3A if you don't care about all the miscellaneous details. Anime got all the main ones.</br>  <br>Not all of them really. A lot of stuff that is important to know is skipped and starting from 3A will make some stuff a bit confusing.</br>   3 days after aired <br> still no fucking sub  <br>Why is this happening?</br></br>  <br>This is anime. Panties is all people care about. And they might be at their progressive stage and want a criminal like Hillary.</br>  <br>Because ladies don't wear pants.</br>  <br>So you came here to be extra cancer by asking if you should watch it instead of just watching it, but ended up blogging about how you were going to be cancer and ended up one anyway?</br>  <br> 重力 - 地球上の物体が地球から受ける力 <br> gravity - the force that an object above ground receives from the earth <br><br>Also known as weight.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We don't care.</br>  Spoilers out.<br> Keith flashback confirmed. <br>Marie appearance. <br>Mysteries all over the place surrounding Eren's birth. </br></br> <br><br>Still waiting for raw leaks.</br></br></br>  <br>The best kind of woman.</br>  <br> you'll never have BH tied up in your basement to serve your needs <br>Why even live.</br></br>  <br>Depends.

Polt is wildly popular. So are others.<br><br>Of course, we all know the True Hidden Bestgirl is Ms. Smith when she  reveals herself to be a Succubus after the Extraspecies Polygamy Law is passed. She abducts Darling before his wedding(s) to claim all that pent up sexual frustration and tension she put him through for herself. And all the girls have to run after her to get him back. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your armour will never protect you from Suu, silly Paladin-kun.</br>  <br>Cerea is up there too</br>  <br>This brings me back.</br>  What topics do you hope will be brought up in this post/pre arc period? <br><br>I hope we get stuff about Dragon and the Revolutionaries addressed, though it looks like they might take off before Luffy wakes up.</br></br>  <br>1.
