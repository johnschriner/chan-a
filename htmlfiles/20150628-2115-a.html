I like you,</br></br>  I watched this scene at least 50 times after finishing the movie.<br><br><br> haunt <br>Why?</br></br></br></br>  KEY really nailed something right with this scene, it hit me harder than anything else in their catalogue.  Not me, but the scene in Fate/Zero where Kiritsugu rolls the bullet across the floor to Kayneth and goes "shhh", then tricks and kills him, had my friend absolutely floored. We were watching it together, and when the scene ended he paused it and stood up and was all<br> HOLY SHIT <br> THAT WAS REALLY GOOD <br> LIKE NOT JUST GOOD FOR ANIME, BUT REALLY ACTUALLY GOOD <br> holy SHIT <br><br>and it is a great scene, but I felt slightly insulted because it was like he was insinuating that every other anime we'd watched wasn't actually good, he was only tolerating it because he expects little from anime and has lower standards, but this one scene elevated itself.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ly5<wbr>_XabvDEU</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>This scene will never leave my brain, amazing and inspired me as well. Nothing can happen until you swing the bat.</br></br></br>  It only got better  <br>Someone post the webm from the next day. The nigger destroyed her.</br>    <br>holy shit. I'm just imagining your dad drew out "fuuuuuck yoooooooou" for all the episodes it took for the cancer to kick in</br>    <br>That's pretty god damn lewd, anon<br> I fucking hate doing this, but my boner demands a source. </br></br>  <br>It literally says it at the very end of the webm, ya dingus.</br>  <br>Do you ever go back and regret your actions?</br>  <br>What?</br>  <br><br>I love Kara no Kyoukai so much. Ufotable should make movies with that art style again</br></br>  The end scene of the film was really nice.<br>The OST get me every time.</br>  This scene alone made a bunch of people watch this series.  <br>Every single episode pretty much.</br>  <br>Sauce? Going to go watch this series because of this one scene now.</br>  <br>Its has shit action for a shitty yuri psuedo-incest cliche monster story.</br>  <br>I thought that would be that "zenmetsu!" scene from Gargantia based on the thumbnail.<br><br>That was the only reason to watch that pile of shit.</br></br></br>  Why didn't my image post? Fucking moot.  <br>Any scene from Evangelion.</br>  <br>Don't listen to that other faggot, the action is badass. It's called Ga Rei Zero, if I spelled that corrected.</br>  off the top of my head,<br> the entire Rain/Green Bird scene from ep.5 of Bebop <br> Asuka lifting the ship up from EoE/Tumbling Down <br> not technically a scene but when i first watched Lain and the whole PRESENT DAY, PRESENT TIME opening <br> Kamina's speech before the TTGL finale <br> Optic Camouflage from GitS <br> the entire final few minutes of Gungrave <br> the swing the bat scene from Fooly Cooly <br> and most recently the ROAD ROLLA DA scene </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;the entire final few minutes of Gungrave <br>FUCK YOU</br></br>  <br>it's okay anon, let the despair course through your veins.</br>    So where the fuck was she?  <br><br>auditioning for sao, she got sick of beta kirito</br></br>  <br>Bell is op enough to one shot goliat. She mostlt is not needed.</br>  Out of the dungeon.  <br>oh shit, she left like 2 days before didn't she? I can't believe I forgot that</br>  <br>Freyja also not present i'm dissapointed. It's will be better with proper closure but probably the action and animation takes too much budget for proper ending party or explanation about bells skill.</br>  <br>  implying kirito is not beta </br>  So, can all we agree that vanilla is best flavor?  <br>He can one shot kill goliath level 5 florr boss he is not beta.</br>  <br>I prefer my icecream to be chocolate and mocha flavored.</br>  So it's confirmed in lastest eps that bell stronger than ryuu and mostly at average level 5 adventurer.  S2 when?  But really, is Vanilla actually the best flavor?<br>Or is chocolate objectively superior?</br>  <br>Beru-kun would still get raped by Ryuu and a lot of other adventurers, but he has a nuke for when shit hits the fan.</br>  <br>Vanilla all the way, brother.</br>  <br><br>That sag...</br></br>  <br>Hopefully Never.</br>  <br>What do you mean. Ryuu cannot even scratch goliat let alone killed it. So do 500 people there.</br>   there are people on /a/ RIGHT NOW who wouldn't fuck Hestia <br><br>Explain yourself, homosexuals.</br></br>  <br>500 is over kill. Probably 1 hundred people.</br>  <br><br>It depends whether she is going to be clingy afterwards. She is completely dependent.</br></br>  <br>Not enough source material.</br>  <br>Because she's not vanilla aizcream you filthy hestia-fag.</br>  <br>Scrap this i missed the ending scenes.</br>  <br> literally 4 to 5 better looking girls in the same show <br> ''hurr everyone should like Hestia'' </br></br>  <br><br>You have 10 seconds to name a single better better than Bestia Hestia.<br><br>That's right, you can't.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They killed Goliath at the 17th floor and went up.</br>  <br>Bell is shit compared to her, she dealt most of the damages with her magic, Bell could charge Argonaut because he was protected, and his allies had done most of the work.</br>  <br>No, have you even seen the anime bell completely obliterated goliath with itd full powered regen still intact. Ryuu cannot even pierce that meat.</br>  <br>Ryuu is merely distractor like the rest of the people there.</br>  <br><br>I don't care about your stupid opinion. I won't even try to state the obvious anymore.</br></br>    <br>Are you stupid. Please watch carefully or try lurking before posting. It's that clear in the anime where the regen try protect the core luckyly bell agi is very high to give a final blow before covered by the regen.</br>  <br><br>I want to fuck Aiz but I feel guilty trying to fuck an autistic girl.</br></br>  <br>Your opinion is stupid and I am not even one of those guys you replied to.</br>  <br>Bell.</br>  <br><br>Bell isn't a woman.</br></br>  <br>No, he's not, your point?</br>  <br><br>Yeah yeah, samefag.</br></br>  <br>Exactly.</br>  <br>Is okay if you're autistic yourself?</br>  <br>  more than 1 people disagreeing with you, it's must be samefag <br>Nice logic you have there.<br>Newfag pls</br></br></br>  <br>Sure thing bro.</br>  <br>fug</br>  <br>Can't argue with that.</br>  <br>Is there any info what skill bell used against goliath? He make himself pure white or emit light on his entire body.</br>  <br>Argonaut. Now fuck off.</br>  <br>nobody know waht the fuck hapening in this ep</br>  <br>Argonaut cannot make his entire body pure white. It's mostly emit light on his weapon peak if it skill attack or in one of his hand if it's charged firebolt.</br>  Where was the giant skelator?  <br>It's easy. It just mean bell is stronger than any level 4 and mostly stronger than average level 5 adventurer. Espescially in terms of power.</br>  <br>Goliath without full armored regen is in form of skull. The flesh is its shield.</br>  Smelling her armpits in the corner  The sexual tension between these two is unbearable. Can anyone spoil me when will they fuck in the novels?  <br>One brings the toys, the other brings the beer</br>  <br> sexual tension <br><br>They're both straight, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Straights is nonexistent species in the anime world.</br>  <br><br>And one of them is elf, so it doesn't count as straight or homo.</br></br>  https://twitter.com/hegame/status/6<wbr>14474394509799424<br><br>Anime producer, editor, and LN twitter account making bait post about animating Oratoria.</br></br></wbr>  Does anyone have a quoted version of the incantation they were saying in full?  <br>Adhd avatar. ...nice</br>  this shit is so bad it's not even funny<br><br>i'm embarrassed the author wrote this and thought it was good enough to show people</br></br>  <br> i'm embarrassed the author wrote this and thought it was good enough to show people <br>You haven't read Zhan Long where the chinese MC university student takes on roughly 20 elite usa special forces and wins by killing most of them and taking the others prisoner for interrogation. The MC even does better in the game. Unlike a lot of other stories, this MC also has a lot of patriotic power leveling activity outside the game.</br></br>  <br> implying you know what the author hasn't explicitly explained </br>  <br>Just like every anime ever right? Fuck off.</br>  Surprised they didn't show Freya either, I still liked the ending but it really needs a sequel.  So how exactly does Argonaut work? Assuming it isn't a chargeable "I win" button  <br>Not really an "I win" attack, but it is basically a charge based on desire to win/time that significantly boosts his attack power, balanced by an extremely long cooldown.<br><br>In terms of adventurer abilities, it's not hugely impressive, but it definitely has utility.</br></br></br>  <br>It is a charge, but not I win.<br><br>The one he used against Argonaut took 3 minutes of charge up time, which for all intents and purposes are too long to be worthwhile in most fights. When he went against the Goliath in volume 8 again, without Ryu and Asufi, they can't do shit against the boss (which is only Level 4 compared to this one) and was actually on the losing side. Argonaut has an insane drawback that is supposed to drain all your stamina, so he is a sitting duck for a while after using it (depending on the charge time).<br><br>It wasn't until Tsubaki (Level 5) came that they could win.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The one he used against Argonaut <br>The one he used against Goliath***</br></br>  <br> not hugely impressive <br> let him one shot a level 5 area boss just after turning level 2 </br></br>  <br>I thought the point was his first shot did jack shit? <br>And even after the rest of the group did their shit his second shot wasn't enough to finish it. <br><br>Didn't Aiz actually solo a level 5 boss by herself?</br></br></br></br>  <br>His first shot obliterated everything it hit. He just stupidly aimed at the head that quickly regenerated.<br><br>Isn't Aiz level 6 though?</br></br></br>  <br>Ryuu looks like she can solo a normal Goliath herself</br>  <br>Welf did more damage than Bell that fight.<br><br>Ryuu and Asfi were undisputed MVPs there though. <br><br>All Bell did was get the final hit, which in turn let him hog all the glory.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>1. It didn't one shot the boss. The boss did not die after the hit, and was in the process of regenerating. If Bell wasn't quick thinking while everyone was retardedly going "oh no", it would've just come back.<br><br>2. If it was just Bell v. Goliath, or Bell with Welf and Lili v. Goliath, they all would've died. He only had the time to cast due to 2 Level 4's, another Level 2, and a strong magic item (along with every other adventurer on that floor) distracting the Goliath.<br><br>3. Compared to the other, higher level adventurers, it's a very unimpressive power, it's just an attack power boost, and those are a dime a dozen. Lefiya at Level 3 gets to break one of the rules of adventurers and can cast any number of magic spells, albeit with some restrictions. Most other adventurers are hard-capped at 3 spells.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ever played Monster Hunter? Do you know how Great Swords work?<br><br>A full charged greatsword will outdamage weapons a bit above them and can do more damage in one swing. That's the Argonaut ability in a nutshell.<br><br>And Bell still didn't kill Goliath with it, just exposed the magic stone.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, he isn't. In a fight he'd be destroyed by any lvl 3+ adventurer, they have better stats and abilities. His nuke won't do shit since he wouldn't have time to charge it and even if he would, he'd probably never be able to hit them with it.</br>  <br><br>Is DanMachi an accurate depiction of Monster Hunter?</br></br>  <br>It's been already explained in the previous threads.<br><br>The boss has a regeneration ability that's based on its mana. So to kill it, first you have to drain the mana.<br><br>Even though it looked like it was regenerating all the time, at the same time its mana reserves were being depleted.<br><br>At the end when everyone used their strongest skill was when it took the largest hits to its mana pool, Welfs OP sword being the last straw.<br><br>All Bell did was the final blow at a point where the boss couldn't regenerate.<br><br>The crystal scene is anime original.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She wasn't when she did it, it's how she got to level 6.</br>  <br> fairlyoddparents.webm </br>  <br>Damn.. someone should shop a sparkle on his teeth. And then the Crest Toothpaste logo on the bottom.</br>  <br>hestia.dance</br>  I just learned a Light Novel, is actually a Nirmal novel with a picture inserted every couple of pages. It's for writers that never found a Manga artist to team up with them  <br>I can barely imagine Bell defeating a Velocidrome.</br>  I love how these LNs with Gary Stu protagonists always have faggots coming out of the woodworks to defend the Gary Stu in detail, saying that the Gary Stu isn't asspulling, he's taking advantage of established mechanics.<br><br>Meanwhile it's clear to anyone that the Gary Stu is asspulling and the writer makes shit up as he goes.<br><br>Touma, Kirito, ONII-SAMA, Bell-kun, same shit different face</br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck is it offline?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=d5I<wbr>hpNYy5Dg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Please no. They already ruined one season. If they animate Oratoria too they'll probably find a way to give Hestia more screentime than Ais, on top of ruining all of Ais's scenes and design. Hasn't the author seen the BD sales?</br>  <br> Shoehorn more Hestia into Oratoria <br><br>I don't dislike Hestia, but that would be so completely retarded dear god please no,</br></br></br>  Finished the anime, does the light novel worth reading?<br>Does the anime skip a lot of thing?</br>  <br>They already did it to the main series. What makes you think they won't do it in Oratoria?<br><br>Not to mention they've flat out said that "we don't know how to animate/draw Ais". Why then would they think it would be a good idea for them to animate Oratoria, a series that is entirely focused on Ais? Fucking greedy incompetent cunts.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean someone should "shop" a cumshot on his teeth and add the brazzers logo.</br>  So glad I wasn't turned off by the series title.<br><br>Mmm...Vanilla.</br></br>  <br>Too poor.</br>  <br>No, it's weak only able to destroy the ripped head that has been attacked numerous time. It's uncomparable to bellmore than half body attack.</br>  <br>It did one shot the boss. He already obliterated it but Regen help him survive with few hp because the attack is not focused to the real core because it's hidden.</br>  <br>No, this the longest charge because the limit off and aimed attack. In reality argonout charge is very short even bell never like he charge anything when use it.</br>  <br> implying he is </br>  <br>Yeah you're right. Plot Armor is one hell of a defense.<br><br>Get real dumbass, "Beru-kun" is a piece of pure shit who gets powerups out the ass when his shitty friends lives are on the line. It's like he's pussy mode 24/7 until a big monster comes threatening MUH FRIEZENS</br></br></br>  <br> It did one shot the boss <br> Regen help him survive <br> He survived the attack, therefore he got one shot <br><br>Sure thing bro.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So where the fuck was she? <br>You missed TWO separate anime episodes where it was stated the Loki party was heading up and out from the dungeon. The analogy from elementary school is that your reading comprehension skills need improvement. Reading comprehension used to be taught in elementary school, but with the republican party "no child left behind" act, lots of courses were made much easier by teachers and school administrators in order for their schools to look good with high GPA and high graduation rates. The higher the GP and graduation rate, the bigger your salary is how the NCLB act sums up. <br><br>Due to the NCLB, it's no wonder your comprehension skills are lacking. Such skill training was moved out of elementary school into the high school realm as optional courses for AP students. I grew up in my area, had kids, and saw how those classes were moved in our school system thru the years since NCLB. NCLB was good for the good schools as they made even more money. But almost all other schools became worse because they watered down courses in order to keep their current level of federal funding or gain more funds.<br><br>I apologize to OP if "comprehension" training in school was not the cause of your problem. But I've seen so much comprehension problem between average students of my time period and today's average students and your question fit neatly into those symptoms.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> son of mutherfucking Zeus <br>Yeah why the fuck is he so garystu?</br></br>  <br>This os not argonaut but limit off. Argonout charge is very shirt he one shot baby dragon without charging he also one kill 3 minos without passive move. His charging is as shory as he is chanting firebolt.</br>  <br>I'm getting real fucking sick of gay people.<br>Every fucking thread it's "I'm gay and everybody has to know lol"<br>Fucking faggots</br></br></br>  <br>Ryu would slice him up before he could react.<br>Remember how Aiz was destroying him with just a scabbard without even trying?</br></br>  <br> Because she's not vanilla aizcream you filthy hestia-fag. <br><br>Ice cream has been made from human milk. With Hestia's breasts you can make a lot more ice cream than from Aiz. Furthermore, I bet Hestia's milky motherly flavour is a lot better than Aiz's lean flavour. <br><br>As to what ice cream names Ben &amp; Jerry's Ice Cream company would give to ice creams made from Aiz or Hestia's goodness, I don't know.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best outfit</br>  <br>Well in anime the regen is still fully intact and full powered. So bell did one shot goliath to the half his body with its regen ability still strong.</br>  <br>Nice meme.</br>   Zeus is his grandfather <br> I'm so special <br><br>Dropped.</br></br></br>  <br>No, bell is stronger. This charge was not argonout. It's far stronger. Argonout not even need Him stand still and doing passive move. No bell is never charging anything have you even seen the anime?</br>  <br>If only it was just a meme.</br>  I really hope cute MCs become the next big thing.  <br> Damn.. someone should shop a sparkle on his teeth. And then the Crest Toothpaste logo on the bottom. <br><br>It probably has been professionally done in japanese TV ads. Marketing may even insist on Bell having different types of big toothy smiles in various episodes to help the toothpaste marketing. Remember, Attack on Titan had such giant marketing that even bread shaped like titan footprints was marketed. Certainly, cleaning products were marketed due to Levi's cleaning habits.<br><br>It would be unbelievable to not have DanMachi toothpaste. I've already seen lots of toothpaste for everything from Sailor Moon to Totoro to My Little Pony. Franky Cola pepsi is allowed to have 1% alcohol in it to give it that Franky kick.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bell is still level 1 without argonaut and limit off and bell is not good fighting non monster because of his soft spot furthermore she is woman.</br>  <br> cute MCs <br><br>Oh please.<br><br>I believe I speak for everyone here when I say Bell-kun wasn't even that cute.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bell and Aiz both drink alcohol (ale?) at Mama's tavern style restaurant, so Bell must be old enough to drink.</br>  <br><br> bell is not good fighting non monster <br><br>The arc that would have taken place after the anime ended is Bell fighting other adventurers. As is the arc after that, he's fairly capable in both though that's after getting even more Aiz training.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He missed the core the real body because he doesn't know but when he knew it he one stab it. It's very large area attack but it's un aimed because the core is hidden.</br>  <br>Nice meme.</br>  <br>No, he is fighting it without any intention to kill. Like when he fought the hades head fighter. He doesn't use firebolt because he cannot control the damage and have big casualties</br>  <br> Attack eradicates the entire upper body down to the hips and exposes the gem, including the flesh on the opposite side of the gem from Bell. <br> A significant amount of the gem would've been in the path of Bell's attack <br> "Oh he didn't hit the gem with it" <br><br>Sure thing bro.<br><br>As retarded as that thought is, it's still more proof that Bell didn't one shot the Goliath.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's un aimed attack at very large area. It would have been different or one shot f it's more focused or consentrated attack at spesific area or target.</br>  What do you call a girl like this?  <br>He seemed not be pulling any punches during the Apollo duel, same with his big fight with Ishtar. He didn't want civilian casualties/damage, when he was running from Soma's group, but he'd still choose to use it in a pinch even though it cause property damage, and might have killed someone who couldn't flee from the now burning building.</br>  <br> Bell can aim and focus that attack <br> If it was more concentrated it would be more powerful <br> Flat-out making shit up to support your argument <br><br>Sure thing bro.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My waifu.</br>  <br>Perfect.</br>  <br>Of course he can control it. It's giant swing the core only got the damage from the far left corner attack not in the middke which is more powerful attack. Have you even seen the anime?</br>  <br> seasonal waifu <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>He has soft spot like it's shown also in the latest episode</br>  If someone is interested.<br>Lossless creditless OP - https://mega.nz/#!7E0HTB7D!YC2yufSp<wbr>gylNmf3GrgAhZ7RsETDqoaKih2sJ6TQlBLk<wbr><br>Lossless creditless ED - https://mega.nz/#!KZUEBYZJ!DzahHwgu<wbr>2tq5nncbeFq53xlbWjiWI-QmzBnVmL-QK9E<wbr><br><br>I'm also uploading the first 2 episodes, single file, but it will take at last another 8 hours.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Find me one scene that shows the Goliath "only got the damage from the far left corner attack.<br><br>Find me one line that says "the middke which is more powerful attack".<br><br>Find me anything that says or shows Bell could've focused that attack to do more damage.<br><br>You have the episode, so go get some pictures and quotes that support your argument and come back.<br><br>Otherwise, kindly shut the fuck up with your retarded assumptions and broken english.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone make a stitch of this shot yet? It seemed like a good moment for it IMO, what with the full frontal panty (leotard?) shot and slight underboob.    <br>Thanks bro</br>  <br>waiting a while to say that newfag?</br>  <br>That's a badass elf.</br>  <br><br>It's a shame this beauty is a dyke.<br>Am I the only one upset here?</br></br></br>  <br>Nice meme.</br>  <br><br><br>Now in the sky, above a distant forest,<br>O Infinite stars, scattered across the cloudless night sky,<br>grant my foolish voice the blessing of starfire,<br>and grant your compassion to those who abandon you.<br><br>Bear within thee the light of stardust<br>and destroy my enemy!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice meme.</br>    <br>So wait, I'm reading the manga, and so part of the reason she likes Bell is because she has huge daddy issues. I mean sure she relates to Bell because she was in a similar situation to him, but you can't deny the fact that her Father looks exactly like him as well.</br>  <br>It's a futile effort to discuss any sort of settings with the Brazilian fanfictions in these threads.

Also considering that she suppressed her memories until she saw Bell, who reminded her of her Father, It could be that she doesn't have any memories of a younger brother who was separated from her at an early age. It would be pretty fucked up if she was inducted into the Familia that helped murder her parents though.<br><br>That would also be an adequate pretext for Best Girl not winning.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Considering season 1 sold like shit, 2ch hated it, and JC Staff's investors are jumping ship, I think it's safe to say season 2 never.</br></br>  <br><br>Read the thread </br></br>  <br>Damn, it's not a great anime but I've had a lot of fun watching it and want to see where the story goes.</br>  <br>You know that a copypasta troll post right?</br>  <br>So where did you get that info from?</br>  How do Hestia fags feel about their character inevitably losing to Vanilla?  <br>https://archive.moe/a/search/text/i<wbr>nvestors%20jumping%20ship/<br>Just some of the variations.</br></wbr></br>  <br><br>Vanilla is probably Bunny's long lost sister though.</br></br>  <br> this fanbase is so obnoxious that they reply to pasta and ask for sauce </br>  <br> This fag replies about fags that reply about pastas <br><br>Come on man.</br></br></br>  <br> 2ch <br>Their opinion is about as relevant as /a/'s when it comes to sales.</br></br>  Is she and the shota the only ones in the guild who like Bete?  <br>She gives furfag his puss allowance, so he has to listen to her</br>  <br>Hestia is working 3 part time jobs for her Bell-kun.

Congrats on finding that, anon.</br>  Is season 1 over?  <br>maybe its a translation issue?</br>  <br>are you seriously retarded, or is this bait?</br>  <br>maybe</br>  <br>Yes, and somehow the LN is to be blamed because the anime writers want to pander to Hestia's boobs. While there is nothing wrong with pandering to generate sales, there are always retard coming in incorrectly assigning blame without watching the anime. <br><br>You should not reply to bait post in general. There's a reason why nobody responded to that guy for 5 hours.</br></br></br>  <br>  middle <br>If it's a blast or shoot.

I can go back and pick out screenshots illustrating every single thing I state here.<br><br>He did not one-shot the Goliath. There's no evidence it's some sort of retarded wide-angle bullet or arrow type attack (wide-angle arrows lol). There's no evidence that that particular attack could be focused to target a specific area. There's no evidence that focusing it on a smaller area would increase its damage. There's no evidence that even it it could focus on a smaller area to increase its damage, that it would've killed the Goliath outright.<br><br> If it's a blast or shoot <br><br>I'm glad you used "if", because it shows you're coming to terms with the fact that all of those retarded theories are pure fantasy and not at all what was shown in the episode.<br><br>The only good thing to come of this show ending is retards like you won't pop in to ruin threads with absolutely idiotic theories based off of fanwank and opinion.<br><br>Now, unless you can show up with any sort of proof other than more retarded opinions, please kindly keep your stupid to yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>they made him use the dagger just because it was hestia dagger. ive read the LN 3 times and its not there<br><br>https://michinium.wordpress.com/201<wbr>5/03/03/danmachi-volume-2-4-pdfs/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>This post is relevant to you <br> The guy you're responding to is one of those people who thinks the translation is more accurate than the raw. </br></br>  Wish this was longer. <br><br>I'm getting post-anime depression.</br></br>  <br>Man, I'd be pissed too if I missed a fight like that.</br>    <br>same, the summer list is looking bad also</br>    <br><br>The newfags edge.</br></br>    <br>The targeted area mean the focused area. Bell should have attacked or targeted the core location Instead above it if he knew its location and that is its core.</br>  <br>Sure, but how could he have known? Who keeps their gem in their hip area instead of chest or head?<br><br>They blasted the giants head off and that did jack shit, so they blasted his whole upper body off next. Makes sense to me.</br></br></br>  <br>He have fought it once. He will have known it the next time he fought it.</br>  <br> he didnt watch youtube of other people beating him <br><br>fuking noob</br></br></br>  <br>That it's the pattern of the skill in the anime. His hand glow if it's magic or firebolt. His weapon glow usually his peak if it skill attack.</br>  So who is the strongest in the danmschi world and if ranked which ranking would Bell belong to?<br><br>Low tier<br>Mid ter<br>High tier</br></br></br></br>  <br>High tier because he is able to one shot goliath if it's not because he has not known the location of the core.</br>  <br>Mid tier</br>  <br>Boipussy tier</br>  How far bell's level now ? For single minded pursuit user his growth is not quick enough.  So, even with all those high level experienced adventurers there, only Bell could destroy the monster. Why not just suck his dick? Fuck this shitty story.  <br>He has rare skill items and zeus grandson.</br>  <br>So, he's basically a gary stu? I knew it.</br>  <br>Away being Her Goddessly self. Relying on Her "Hero". <br><br>Besides, if She DID join in it wouldn't have even lasted long enough for an entire Episode.</br></br></br>  <br>The ln pacing is quite slow to confirm that.</br>  <br>The problem here is not her chest bat her manshoulder.</br>  <br>Anime did a piss poor job at showing the contribution of the higher level adventurers and even welf crozzo's...<br>IT was a good anime up to the ending where they somehow had to shoehorn bell doing "what seemed like" a one-hit ko followed up by a tap.</br></br>  <br>Even before that Bell was destroying higher level monsters himself.</br>  <br>Nah, him destroying the higher level minotaur had tension and he obviously had extreme difficulty killing it. That was a really good fight wherein he was not gary-stu at all.</br>  <br>It was and it still is. Stop defending shit when it's shit.</br>  <br>Look anon, we share the same dislike of the final episode but you are just raging uncontrollably here if you cant appreciate the minotaur fight for what it is; a well choreographed fight scene of a boy who wanted to be a hero against a foe greater than himself.<br><br>The fight had him getting beat up and be in excruciating pain. Destroy his armor, break his spirit yet even against this odd he stood up and he pondered a thought "how to defeat the minotaur".<br>Up to that point he was being trained by Aiz and learned how to counter attack. He was honing his skills from grinding mobs. He got magic from an old book and he had the blessing of his goddess in form of a really good knife.<br>He accepted that he was a coward and that is good. Not getting hit is better than being stupidly heroic.<br>He knew that every slicing attack he did with the knife was not enough to pierce the minotaur's hide; his firebolts were not enough to put a dent into the minotaur.<br>He had the knowledge from lili that larger weapons are better against larger foes.<br><br>With all these he then put things in motion by:<br>Disarming the minotaur<br>Using it;s own large weapon agaisnt it to create cuts and openings where he can land his knife better,<br>Stage a fake bull rush attack into a counter into the belly of the beast.<br>And with his weak magic, BURST the ever living crap out of the minotaur from inside out.<br><br>It did not matter how much mana he had left, he had to do it at that moment and he did till his mind went numb!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nerf Argonaut</br>  <br>Sucking ma dick</br>  <br>Ottarl has:<br>Boars' Blood- health passively regen<br>Achilles Heel- can't be damaged unless damage at one region<br>Divine Devotion- immunity to all magic damage<br>Goddess' Protege- Self level boost</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he's level 2</br>  <br>we dont know when ottar got those skills, how about if he had achilles heel at lvl 2?</br>  <br> comparing end-game skills to a level-2 skill </br>  <br>what if he had those skills at level 4-5? <br>I can speculate too</br></br>  <br>That immunity.

It's a lot better than the first one and that one was already great. I really like how they handled all the cut outs in the pages.</br></br>  2 and a half hours left.  Ruri~  0 hours left, mono's pc case is broke    <br>I always wondered why black people fucking love anime, jrpgs, yugioh, and fighting games.</br>  Clear-Eyes when?  <br>cause they have nerds too?<br> inb4 niggers ain't ppl </br></br>    <br>Nah man, they fucking love that shit, especially fighting games and yugioh, it's just odd. Why those two things?</br>  <br>Black people love YGO and DBZ and Digimon because they were the poor-man's entertainment back in the late 90s / early 00s, prior to cable and satellite television becoming much more affordable for the poor. I would know, I was a gigantic poorfag who kept getting Pokemon games a generation behind.</br>  <br>they tend to have a really big split in their pop culture though. Half of it is the chill pop/soft drink stuff and the other half is the gangster culture. I guess their chill culture allows it to be more open minded to games, probably cause DM was such a hit on tv.</br>  Are we watching on the dolphin today?  <br>Fair enough I guess, though I loved all of those and I wasn't poor. <br><br>True, but I've seen some thug ass black dudes at yugioh tournaments. I'm not talking about chill nice bro black dudes, I'm talking straight up compton mothafuckas. A lot different than MTG tournaments were I see a few normal dudes, but mostly scrawny white kids and pretentious fatasses.</br></br></br>  <br>i want to fuck yuuya~</br>  <br>Yuzu stop it</br>  <br><br>I think it also has to do that while pokemon and yugioh and shit were poorfag friendly they also got a big chunk of the more rich people. That bridge might also be why there is more black people in these area's.<br><br>Unrelated all the black people at my locals are fucking pro at spending money on trading cards.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br> Unrelated all the black people at my locals are fucking pro at spending money on trading cards. <br><br>Same here, they're fun to play with though. We have this one black guy at our locals that straight up acts like he's out of the anime, he gets hyped as shit every time he duels. It's pretty entertaining.</br></br></br>  <br>Black nerds are some of the best nerds because they aren't afraid to become physical, which makes nerd-arguments that much more tense and engaging. One of my black friends nearly went apeshit on a scrawny white kid because the white claimed Batman was the best DC superhero, and the black kept providing evidence and arguments about how Wally West Flash is the best DC superhero.<br><br>Needless to say I like the Scarlet Speedster a helluva lot more now.</br></br></br>  How do we make Crow egao?  <br>food</br>  <br>Gib fud.</br>  <br>Have him duel Mitchio.</br>  <br>Black people have no stigma on being fucking pissed which is kinda cool. Also to add to the being cool factor the black guy at my locals plays dedicated Hero's cause he likes Marvel/DC and cause of Jaden.</br>  <br>Why is Yuya giving him a card? Or is he giving Yuya a card?</br>  <br>I love the fact that for as limited/short as GX Abridged was it's somehow set up this stigma of Judai being a wigger.</br>  <br> BUY BLACKWINGS, Yuya. <br>He gives him a tuner monster to be revealed at his fight against Jack.</br></br>  <br>I really liked the Abridged even if just for that.</br>  <br>watch it somehow be a new sub-performapal/sub odd-eyes archtype in the making.</br>  <br>Same, I wish he was actually like that.</br>  <br> Odd-Eyes Blackwing Pendulum Dragon <br> This is Yuya's Synchro instead of Clear Wing </br></br>  <br> he won't eat Yugo at all <br> they become buds <br> Yuya gets his synchro from Yugo teaching him <br><br> &gt;and zuzu gets shays xyz teachings like the boards fortold </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The actual quality of this episode is looking great so far. Ebina should be in charge of every episode.</br>  <br>If it were possible to only have to hire and pay one animation director and one writer, they'd do it.<br><br>At this point I'm simply thankful for when an episode is at least ok in animation quality that it isn't distracting, and extra grateful if it manages to look pretty good.</br></br></br>  <br>A better name would be Black-Winged Pendulum Dragon, to follow suit with Rune-Eyes and Beast-Eyes' naming schemes.</br>  <br>Actually yeah Blackwing(ed) Pendulum Dragon would also be a good opposite to Clear Wing Synchro Dragon too.</br>  <br><br> this might actually be a thing </br></br>  <br>Either way, all Yuya needs for a Synchro is to bond with a synchro native, doesn't matter who. And sharing cards is basically giving him a summon method STD like with Sora, Yuzu, and poly.</br>  <br>If it doesn't I'll honestly be surprised. I just don't see Yugo getting eaten by Yuya, maybe Yuri, but not Yuya.</br>  <br>I want it to be Yuri. 3 vs 1 dragon fight later down the line just doesn't hold a lot of tension even if Yuri is only 2nd to Leo in Academia.</br>  Of fuck I just realized 'Ray' and 'Vector' are both geometry terms.  <br>Either way I don't see Yuri taking Clear Wing for himself, chances are he'd just rip it in half or take it with him to throw in Rin's face.</br>  <br>How's sixth grade?</br>  <br> Yuya vs. Yuri. <br> Yuya has all three Odd-Eyes, Dark Rebellion and Clear Wing on the field. <br> Yuri's in a pinch. <br> Top decks Super Poly and fuses them all with his Fusion Dragon. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't be mean anon, some people didn't noticed all the references to Opera and Biology in the second half of 5Ds after all.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=cWF<wbr>3JD11LCE</wbr>  [ ]</br>  d2 is out<br>fat is dutch</br>  <br> Yuri Super-Poly's a retrained FGD </br>  I found Ruri.  <br>Which just means Yuya's getting Clear Wing</br>  Any stream link guys?  <br>Ruri best imouto.</br>  <br>What if Ruri is Shun's older sister and she just happens to look like a 14 year old girl and all the Ruris are her daughters...oh shit.</br>  <br>Dude, Yuri will get Clear Wing</br>  <br>Not necessarily. <br><br>I doubt he'd use it. He seems up his own ass about Fusion.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh nvm, found one... i think.<br><br>They're playing golf for the next 26 minutes.</br></br></br>  How many more episodes till Jack shows up?  <br>3 episodes left.</br>  <br>He will fuse his dragon with Clear Wing<br>Just like Yuya Xyz his Odd-Eyes with Dark Rebellion</br></br>    hair down Yuzu   <br>HOLY SHIT</br>  <br>Now she really does look just like Ruri! THANK YOU BASED GOD.</br>  Will Jack summon all 3 Red Demons??  <br>SHOWER SCENE SHOWER SCENE</br>  <br>MY FUCKING DICK</br>  <br> tfw Yuzu is wearing Rin's clothes. <br> You can totally see Yuzu's Yuzus are definitely smaller. </br></br>  <br>Dick status: muh.</br>  <br>God Yuzu/Yugo is so much better than anything else, I'm glad she finally hit that phase of wanting a bad boy with a heart of gold who drives a motorcycle and escapes cops. <br><br>Now we just need Serena's hair down too. <br><br>That means Yugo notices the face more than the ruri's ruris, truly a wonderful man.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Took them long enough</br>  <br>Muh status: dick</br>  <br> you will never be 14/15 years old with your ruri and experience this kind of feeling <br><br>Getting old blows.</br></br></br>  <br> you will never actually experience anything like this because you're a wizard <br>Getting magic fuckin' rocks.</br></br>   What's the name of the website that has the link to the livestream? Something that starts with d? I want to search the archive. Nobody post the actual link for obvious reasons   <br> wont even be a wizard <br> instead you'll be a warlock because you were c-sectioned <br><br>Didn't even get to touch a pussy on birth, what a sad existence. VR age when? I just wanna go to a little perfect world where I win over the hearts of ruris and win duels.</br></br></br></br>  <br>douyu</br>  <br>thanks</br>  <br>her bangs have even more of a kurosaki swoop than before.<br><br>neat.</br></br></br>  <br>Wow they really are going out of their way to make Yuzu look as much like Shun as possible huh? Too bad in the end they're all adopted.</br>  <br> Shun is actually blood related to the Ruris <br>Maybe his mother had 4 Ruris, but she couldn't handle all of them , so she gave 3 of them on interdimensional adoption.</br></br>  <br>any username to look for?</br>  <br>Starts with m</br>  Live pics<br> http://board.futakuro.com/jk2/res/<wbr>1693529.htm</wbr> <br> http://a.jlab2.net/ </br></br>  <br>Found it. haha...</br>  <br>There's mostly two links in the archives, and I think both lead to the correct goal.</br>  STARTING<br>HANASE MONSTAH</br>  We start with FOOD  <br> that blushing Sawatari <br><br>I'm glad they kept him around, whether he jobs or not. All his interactions with everybody is great, especially him asking Yuya about his hippo.</br></br></br>   prison food   Sawatari's monster still looks good.  <br>Serena has turned me to the waifus, she's just perfect.</br>  <br>YOU'RE FORGIVEN FOR ALL THE MEDIOCRE EPISODES THIS ARC, ARC V<br>BEST RURI BACK ON TOP</br></br>  Why does Crow's hair have all the budget?  Jesus Yugo, dat ass. Yugo and Yuzu are cute, I hope she never finds Yuya again.  Wait, are they putting up doomsday posters now or what?  That handwriting.<br><br>I assume Yugo wrote both of these because Yuzu's starts with a scribbled out "Ri" so Yugo tried to write her name as Rin first.<br><br>And yeah Yuzu confirmed for tournament.</br></br></br></br>  Are we sure Rin and Yugo aren't dating. He tried to hug her as she came out of the shower.    MUH   RIIIN <br> WOOPS YUZU RIGHT </br>  fuuuuuck I got booted from the stream  THAT YUZU  <br>Probably not, but he probably doesn't think too much when he does things anyways.</br>  GOD  <br>Mother of god.</br>  LETS ENJOY!  <br>BEST HEROINE</br>  Ebina has saved us. Shower scenes for the other Ruris when?!  Did Sawatari just walk in without being invited?  <br>When doesn't he? Serena isn't there to hold him back.</br>   UAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH</wbr>   <br>He decided to take part way before.</br>  Sawatari relevant for sure this time.   KOI    Yuya's face hearing Yuzu being targeted by Security. <br><br>Love it.</br></br>  Yuya super happy about the whole Crow thing.  Welp he is back in Yuzu.wav mode   Still worried about the Citrus   Is Yuya zetsubouing right now?  what happened to Yuuya?  <br>Meanwhile<br><br> Yuzu is busy playing house with Yugo </br></br></br>  <br>I think Yuzu slapped Yugo because he was saying she should wear Rin's clothes since they're the same size</br>  Fuck everything, I'm glad Ebina is animating this episode, that Yuzu was too much for one dick to handle.  <br> Yuzu is being targeted by security <br> Crow is being a cunt for my sake <br> and is escaping </br></br></br>    <br>So it really was a comment about her breasts that set her off, right?</br>  The Citrus thirst is still real.  <br>Yes, he said she was the same size as Rin.</br>  <br>Fucking hell Yuya.</br>  WHAT DID GONG SAY??  Dennis no, get away from the Ruri!  UH OH  HOLY SHIT SHUN IS FUCKING BATMAN  JAILBREAK HERE WE GO  Dunanananananana Shunman  FUCKING SHUN  NINJA SHUN  Fuck me Shun you are putting Yusei to shame.  <br><br><br> Shun has the physical capabilities of Batman <br> Reiji has the NEET cave, surveillance, and intelligence <br><br>These two are Gods.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   PRISON GUARDS GETTING DISTRACTED BY RARE CARDS   MIRROR FOOOOORCE  <br>oh god my everything can't handle it anymore<br><br><br>and i'm still in love with yuya it seems</br></br></br></br>  HOLY SHIT ACTION DUEL SO CONVENIENT  <br>Dark Mirror Force actually.</br>  <br> Dark Mirror Force </br>   MFW THE HYPE RETURNED   <br>Dark Mirror Force actually</br>  THOSE FUCKING SWAT DUELISTS  Serena kawaii face.

And then Reiji pops up from no where.</br>  <br>Or Yugo is just stupid, he is pretty stupid. There is no reason to draw their ruris a different size, the hair is enough to differentiate them.</br>  <br>Deskbot</br>  <br>deskbot</br>  <br> scale 1 <br>Deskbots confirmed for OP</br></br>  <br>People got distracted.<br>I guess Yuzu figured that going around like a doomsday prophet is both risky and dumb, so she tried another tactic.<br>I bet that when fusion invades some random citizen will yell "THE POSTERS TRIED TO WARN US"</br></br></br>  Had a bad stream tonight, but at least heard Yuya Yuzu fagging and Yugo and Yuzu are going to enter the Friendship Cup. Nice knowing you Banana.  <br>Deskbots you dumb nigger</br>  <br>Deskbot ya dingus.<br><br><br>It's supposed to be funny so when Academia does strike, one of the posters will fly at the feet of the people who mocked Yuzu earlier.</br></br></br></br>  <br>BASED EBINA SAVE SYNCHRO ARC</br>  <br>He still saved the day.</br>  <br>Deskbot time</br>  <br>There are way more important things to talk about with those two.

They'll become the new power couple and Yuya and Rin will hit it off.</br>  <br/>  <br>That's one way to slowly kill a man. Like that one guy from A-1 studios who ended up ded from work</br>  <br>THANKS ANON</br>  I really like Big Star's costume changing gimmick, its neat.  <br>It took 60+ episodes for Arc-V to indulge in fanservice.<br>Arc-V really is the anti-Zexal</br></br>  <br>This.<br>Yugo literally had Yuzu registered for the Friendship Cup.</br></br>  <br>God dammit Ebina I can only masturbate so much.</br>  Shun &gt; Yusei  EBINAAAAAAAAAAAAA  <br>Ruri?</br>  <br>How can one man be so based?</br>  <br>EBINAAAA truly cares about good FANSERVICE</br>  <br>But can Shun counter Yusei's shoryuken?</br>  <br>end card?</br>  <br>Even Ebina knows Yuzu still da best.</br>  <br>No, just a sketch from twitter/twipple.<br><br>End cards for Arc-V would be neat, though.</br></br></br>  <br> Dat shun </br>  <br> Jack mentoring a young Yugo and Rin like Yusei with the twins <br><br>I want this.</br></br></br>  <br>It's the power of Yuzu</br>  <br><br> "Fucking Ebina" <br> "Animating an episode just because of Yuzu" <br> "Why couldn't he" <br> "Animate the Jack duel?" <br><br> "Oh." </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Everyone thought prison was going to suck but it ended up being the best part of Synchro so far  <br> dem thigh <br> dem collarbone <br> dem armpit <br> dem fresh from bath looks <br> dem hair down <br>never know ZUZU this sexy</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he is the independent yu who would save us all from the pink and the green yu's.</br>  <br> しらねえ <br>www</br></br>  <br> dat ninja shun <br>why he is so based everytime he appear?</br></br>  <br>Arc-v's arcs seem to be slow burns.</br>    Roger is so gonna fire PSP-kun   Prison is boring <br> Yuzu fanservice and Shun dick sucking <br> PRISON IS THE BEST EVER GUYS <br>Nice one, /a/rc-v</br></br></br>  I really want Ebina Serena time now.

I've only seen two anniversary requests, and a few birthdays.</br>  <br>Very cute.</br>  <br>I wonder how many of those people really have birthdays this week and is not just making up shit.</br>  <br>I trust Anonymous.</br>  <br>h-happy anniversary ! </br>  If he can get  without being in the circle then by fucking god my anniversary/birthday is next week!  <br>Great coloring, weak drawing.</br>  <br>Thank you! I love it. You have a good weekend color friend.</br>  <br>god damn adorable.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127282524 <br>Nice spoiler, fuckhead</br>    <br><br>God tier.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127282524 <br> messing up the spoilers </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127282524 <br>holy shit</br>  <br>Weak how anon? <br>I thought the composition was nice.</br></br>  <br>can you point out whats wrong with it to help him improve?</br>  <br>Not him, but the line work could be more refined as well as the neatness of the whole thing. Some of the colors spill out of the lines. Personally, I would have preferred her doing something with her hands and a small head tilt to be a little more dynamic. Regardless, it all came together quite nicely.</br>  <br>The composition is fine. His figure/lines are just weak. <br><br>Take BB for instance. His figure drawing is a lot stronger. There's dimension etc. People in waifu threads get dazzled by pro coloring and disregard the drawing itself-no matter how feeble it is(not that this guy's is absolutely horrible).</br></br></br>  <br>Well yes it's a bit rushed, isn't that the nature of this whole thing? <br>I mean his value work is insane. <br>I mean that alone does not mean everything is great but it's a picture that focused on it instead of something like movement. <br>Personally I only dislike the sharp blur filter but once again I think it's just because it's a rushed work.</br></br></br></br>  <br>thats valid criticism i suppose...</br>  Requesting a drawing of Cave at the beach in her swimsuit.  <br>I think the way her hair is in motion instead of her covers the dynamic aspect.</br>  <br>I don't think you can say the figure is weak if it works. I mean sure it could be more interesting but it's not like that is the only measure of a drawing. Being able to make a good one with a simple pose is very important too. <br>If you want to rate him as an artist this picture alone is not enough to judge that, and one picture really can't ever do that anyways. <br>It could be he struggles with more complicated gestures and and figures but you can't tell that from that picture alone.</br></br></br>  There's always that one person.  <br>And as the artist, it's that one person's comment you always remember.</br>  <br>Yeah, but it's like. They weren't asking for any critique or anything like that. I bet they wouldn't have responded with that criticism at all if there weren't a ton of people saying they liked the art.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure once you get to this point you know how to handle critique, good and otherwise.</br>  <br>Here you go, Inoribro</br>  <br><br><br>if only someone kept track</br></br></br>  <br>Sure, I can: It's a weak drawing. It hasn't got dimension and his lines lack confidence. <br><br>Also, why bother getting defensive about anonymous critiques? Especially if you aren't even the artist. Who cares, really.</br></br></br>  <br>Of course they wouldn't have. It's frustrating having something relatively simple get so much attention while your best efforts don't always measure up.<br><br><br>Not angrily denying there's a problem is one thing. Not being bothered by it for weeks is another.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you keep track of birthdays too or only anniversaries?</br>  <br>Ugh.</br>  <br>thats a birthday list</br>  <br>Am I in there?</br>  <br>What is this? Where is it from?</br>  <br>Oh.</br>  <br>I'm not defensive, this is called a conversation anon. <br>You said the figure is weak but it's not. It works for the composition very well. <br>Yeah the linework is not strong but doing that well takes a good bit of time.</br></br></br>  <br>Props to you anon.<br><br>And if anything, my waifu's anniversary is in a month</br></br></br>  <br>who could forget your birthday, anon</br>  <br>nice!!</br>    <br><br>OR here, I think it really fits. She has very long hair for her height, and she knows how to be graceful when the situation requires it, which is exactly the sort of situation where long hair shines. In this image, she has both dignity/grace (straight, unmoving pose) and cuteness/liveliness (flowing, moving hair, plus her smile). That's one of the reasons I'd still think it's beautiful even if it wasn't her.</br></br>  <br>Awesome collage list.</br>  <br>Requesting the whole birthday list. I want to know if mine is recorded.  It's in November  </br>  Hi everyone. Requesting my love Shinobu laughing after hearing something particularly ridiculous.<br><br>Thank you for considering!</br></br>  <br>feels good knowing you don't have to keep track of me since i've never requested on my birthday.</br>  <br> misha  <br>What a shit list.</br></br>  <br>Deliverin' I guess?<br>I hope this isn't too rude because the other anon colored it, but I ended up coloring this also to practice.

I was feeling a bit greedy today. Would 2 deliveries be able to redeem me?</br>  <br>It happens. I'm not sure whether no information or incomplete information is worse, but I really just want her birthday or something. <br><br>It would mean so much to have a special day.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah</br>  <br>Don't know<br>Ask the circle!</br></br>  <br>Two REALLY GOOD deliveries, maybe.</br>  <br>Just go by the release of whatever she's from, that's what I do.</br>  <br>True, now I have to choose between manga and anime release</br>  <br>Don't have one.</br>  <br> the only mention of her birthday is from some game that has almost nothing in common with the source material, and it's just her VA's data </br>  <br>I know that feel wall to well.

I don't know what is pretentious about that but I think they could show us some nipples already.  Keep hating bitch nigga.  <br>Ayy</br>  <br>Overly flamboyant shots for no reason other than to be cool and artsy partsy.</br>  <br>I call that good-eatin'.</br>  Shaft fanservice gives me the feel of an artsy playboy music video. They even use abstract sets and similar shots  They're not nearly as pretentious as that hack Yuasa  <br><br>Shouldn't you be on /pol/ celebrating fag marriage?</br></br>  Bakemonogatari is ruined by its gratuitous fanservice<br>I love Shaft when they choose to be tasteful</br>  <br>Or maybe to get your dick hard?</br>  <br>Summer is real</br>  <br>Why is it panning to the neighboring room then?<br><br>Why isn't it showing nipples?<br><br>Why the retarded face shots?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why isn't it showing nipples? <br>Do you really need to ask that question?<br> panning <br>You don't even know simple cinematographic terms and yet you think you can label shots as pretentious?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Do you really need to ask that question? <br>I think I need to</br></br>  <br>This.</br>  Tired of Shaft's bullshit.

No, it was the funniest.</br>  <br>I agree, Nozaki-kun was good too.

Seriously why was it so fucking good? I mean the fact it had lots of sol shenanigans was so good. Also it felt fresh that Main Villain wasn't a guy that wanted to take over the world but one that just wanted a peaceful life. Kira was a goddamn amazing Villain. I don't know why people think Dio is great Villain when you have a character like Kira who was clever, cunning, and intelligent as fuck. He felt more complex than Dio could ever be. The Stands were far more creative and dangerous than Part 3 too. Part 4 was so much better than Part 3.<br><br>I really want David Productions to animate the Italian Restaurant arc so bad now.

New chapter. His name is Josefumi Kujo.<br><br>http://bato.to/read/_/329173/jojos-<wbr>bizarre-adventure-part-8-jojolion_c<wbr>h44_by_hi-wa-mata-noboru<br><br>http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>that's actually a way I never thought about it before, and it makes somewhat more sense....I think. Still a weird stand though imo</br>  <br>Made in Heaven just speeds time up by an amount equal to the sum of the users Gayness x Priestliness. <br><br>The reset was unintended but broke logic.</br></br></br>  <br> Doesn't it effectively slow down the brains of every animal so their perception of time is slowed and time seems to go faster? <br>No.<br><br> But instead of actually doing that, what speeds up is the universe in itself and keeps life in a stasis so they don't age, and as it reaches infinite speedup the universe reaches the big crunch and everything is reworked again? <br><br>Yes. Basically, it makes time go very fast but doesn't affect living things. Life isn't kept in stasis so much as the death/rebirth of the universe happened in seconds.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Spin off with the adventures of VAMPIRE BANANA MAN and his trusty sidekick GAY PRIEST when  I thought that once MiH reaches the reset point, everything still alive is "killed" and then reborn in the new universe.<br><br>That's why you have the 36 Kars, because the old ones survive but new ones are being reborn.</br></br>  Tsukihime remake news in Type-Moon Ace in a few days  <br> Three years pass by and they can only start a conversation about Tsuki by saying how much Fate sucks / is milked / always sucked and Nasu still hates them. <br>This was a thing long before the remake was even announced.</br></br>  <br>Why should he be grateful when he barely has any memories of the mansion and already had a comfy life at the Arimas? And the place has barely any electronics, so it feels like living in the 1800's.</br>  <br>July 1</br>  <br> Have Shiki better written <br>Shiki's personality was already expanded on in Kagetsu Tohya and Melty Blood. There isn't much Nasu needs to do.</br></br>  <br>Dat Cu.</br>  Where do Giftias go when they die?  VN when? i'm pretty sure there will be at least 1 ass pull end  <br> we will never get an alternate ending where Tsukasa goes crazy and leaves Isla to die alone while he pounds Michiru all night <br><br>It would be absolutely terrible, but it would be perfect</br></br></br>    That ambiguous ending makes me wonder whether that new giftia is Isla with a new OS or not. <br><br>The 9 month skip does seem to resemble a sort of rebirthing for both the MC and the new Isla.</br></br>   Tsukasa makes the last memory of Isla giving her the dick hard <br> he reaches over and turns her off before crying out MY SEXBOT IS DEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD </br></blockquote>]
