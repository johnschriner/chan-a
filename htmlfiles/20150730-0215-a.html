[ Dumping                                <br>And done.<br><br>Thanks Mega guy<br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!CAlXEY7L!cooK<wbr>ERhviytsGX16p2iVMg</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br> as powerful as Negi <br><br>Oh come on</br></br></br>  <br>Could just be "as powerful as his thunder form"</br>  <br>It can move as fast as he did anyway. And probably hit just as hard as Negi did in his thunder form.</br>  <br>They orobably have no idea how strong Negi was or even more, is.<br><br>I'm not wanking or anything but this kind of stuff happens all the time in manga, it's just hyping shit up</br></br></br>  <br>So, is the Negi NTR still going stronk in UQ Holder?<br>I dropped because of it. Had never seen an author NTR his own MC with another manga's MC. It's like he doesn't give a fuck about Negima.<br><br>Well the fact that Eva is a totally different character(in personality) makes me wonder if he just decided to blow Negima off</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kirië should win the Touta-Bowl.</br>  <br>At this point Eva can be considered 3 characters, Kitty (between 16 and 60 years old), Eva (600 years old) and Yukihime (700 years old), which makes sense considering how old is she, Akamatsu is following the idea that nobody will remain the same after such a long time. It doesn't help that Yukihime saw most of his friend die of old age, the two guys he liked defeated and controled by the Lifemaker and her first love turned into an amnesic little kid.</br>  <br>Regarding Yukihime: Mother or Wife?</br>  <br>Older sister.</br>  <br>I fucking love his monster designs.</br>  <br>We all do</br>  <br>Of course he is.<br><br>Negi? Who? Man we have a cool clone of negi now that NTRs him. Get on with the times</br></br></br>  <br>well in part you have to recall negi's strongpoint wasn't supposed to be his pure battle strength, he was just pretty strong as well as being really smart. there's probably tons of monsters and shit throughout eternity that are just as strong, if not stronger, than negi was. However negi is a stronger foe because negi is a genius rather than because negi is more pwoerful</br>  <br>Damn, it took 80 chapters but I'm finally starting to enjoy this series as something more than a sad Negima sequel.</br>  <br>Negi was never interested in Eva.</br>  <br>You marry her first so that she becomes your wife then you impregnate her and she becomes a mother.</br>  I wonder if it's like the thing Rakan fought.  <br>I wonder if Akamatsu makes notes about those little background comments and then develops a storyline about it that can be used somewhere in the future</br>  <br>that's actually an impressive callback.</br>  <br>good idea incompetent</br>  <br>Kirie is best girl, even though she knows that she is helping the competition, she is willing to still help Touta keep the promise. She is really a good girl.</br>  You know, as retarded savescumming is, I'm glad it's here for moments like this one.<br><br>In any other manga they would have just one chance and have to pull one massive asspull.<br><br>At least here even if we know there will be an asspull they will go through a gorillion loops at first to figure out which asspull works and which one does not.<br><br>Although, I wonder how the fuck Kuromaru managed to survive it when Tota and Kirie couldn't even notice it the first time and even when trying to camp him he skill was going to fuck them over sideways to next sunday.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kyrie's blushing face is love here.</br>  <br>Kuromaru is an exorcist, he has a lot of skills that helps him fight spirits like this guy. Think of how Kurt was able to hit thunder form Negi back in Negima.</br>  <br>Touta is living the life!</br>  <br>perhaps you want to rephrase that</br>  <br>Pretty sure he noticed the spirit and was observing him, he only got in the range because he saw his friends and got insta-killed.</br>  <br> person who never met Negi saying how strong he was <br>So not only did they make Negi sterile, but now they are downpowering him/making fucking MOOKS his level of strength to prop up Touta as not a total shitlord</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't say she's the best girl, but she's definitely a good one. She isn't devoted to winning at any cost while trampling all over the feelings of her crush. She knows Touta care a lot about fulfilling his promise, and in fact it's one of the things she likes about him, so she'll help him fulfill it.<br><br>Of course, she's not going to stop trying to twist him arm to find out the full story, because she's not an idiot or anything.</br></br></br>  <br>I think Kuro was more like running away from the spirit and then jumped to help Touta and Kyrie which got him insta-killed with them. <br><br><br>Yeah, I really liked that part, I feel it shows she cares about him and the things important to him. Plus I don't blame her for wanting to know, her chances to win the bowl ride on that info. <br><br>I like how in this arc, Kyrie has finally become one of Totua's true friend. I certainly feel she is closer to him than she was before this whole mess.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Running away from something with lightning speed? He still needed to find a way to take the book, it's unlikely that he gave up.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, you are right, reading it again, it looks like Kuro jumped out of hiding to save those two.</br></br>  <br>They got there a day earlier, meaning Kuro died/fought already their first run to the ruins.</br>  <br><br>High level spirit as strong as Negi, Rakan, and Fate during Negima (technically Negi &gt; both). Power creep is a bitch, but maybe they won't outright beat it.</br></br>  <br> Negi&gt; Rakan <br>Debatable, it's possible he was not even the strongest, considering his rival Fate lost to Eva.</br></br>  <br><br>That thing one-shotted Kirie, Touta, and Kuro twice, I hardly think that calling it as strong as Negi is downplaying Negi's strength.</br></br>  <br><br>It's not really debatable, Negi even hits as hard as Rakan does physically, has faster speed, and high speed regeneration.<br><br>Eva was the strongest character outside The Mage of the Beginning﻿ and possibly Nagi in Negima, so Fate drawing with a weaker version of her while noticeably being stronger than before doesn't say much.<br><br><br><br>As if they're impressive in the grand scheme of things at the moment.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Friendly reminder that Kurt Godel managed to land a critical hit on Lightning Negi. Lightning Negi was not that powerful. Rakan only briefly had to get serious with him.<br><br>I'm sure Kuromaru can do the same trick Kurt pulled here.</br></br>  <br> hits as hard as Rakan does physically <br>No, Negi has regen but he is far less durable than Rakan, he managed to last that long against Rakan because he had Asuna's artifact and Rakan was not serious most fo the time.</br></br>  <br><br>Except Negi was much stronger at the end of Negima than he was during his fight against Rakan or Kurt, and ZnT is the ultimate Shinmeiryuu exorcist technique that Kuromaru probably doesn't know - did Setsuna know it? It bypasses magic shields, harms elementals, and should be able to directly target the soul. Tsukuyomi was able to cut up Fate.<br><br>Seeing how Kurt was also able to react to hundreds of Negi lightning clones at that point, you're underselling him. Takahata, Kurt's more or less equal, agreed Negi outstrips him by a very large degree at the end, anyway.<br><br><br><br>Nah, Fate says Negi punches just as hard as Rakan does during their last fight. Fate is well antiquated with Rakan's fists, and he was able to destroy the mandala esque barrier with one punch (he punched Negi countless times after the fact). <br><br>Did you actually read Negima after the Rakan fight?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this the guy that Rakan references when he talks about why he can count Negi based on his lightning trails?</br>  <br>Zanmaken no Tachi is good, but he will have to hit him. That thing is lightning speed and can kill him in one hit.</br>  <br>It was a stylistic figure, referring to the feelings he puts in his punches anon, a shonen thing. Negi is faster and has regen, Rakan has more strength and durability.</br>  <br> ZnT is the ultimate Shinmeiryuu exorcist technique that Kuromaru probably doesn't know <br><br>He uses it in like ch 4 I think.</br></br></br>  <br> Except Negi was much stronger at the end of Negima than he was during his fight against Rakan or Kurt <br>Doesn't matter. Lightning is Lightning, and Lightning is vulnerable. Both Rakan and Kurt were able to get hits in. Kuromaru just has to get a hit in.<br><br>That's the point I was trying to make: It doesn't matter how powerful Negi was, or how powerful that lightning spirit is. We know it can be hurt. Like  says, all that's needed is to actually get the hit in.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And now he got hardass training by Dana, he's prolly the strongest of the group right now.</br>  <br><br>No, it was a direct comparison in strength. You're reaching tremendously. Negi took dozens of punches from Fate, who could one shot Quintum in one punch, and took on the Tearing Earth/Thousand Thunderbolts collision. Whether or not Rakan has more durability is up for debate. <br><br><br><br> That's the point I was trying to make: It doesn't matter how powerful Negi was, or how powerful that lightning spirit is. <br> Lightning Negi was not that powerful <br><br>Yeah, okay.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> punches Fate <br> Fate blocks it easily <br>Okay.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you retarded and/or can't tell Negi and Fate apart?</br></br>  <br> No, it was a direct comparison in strength. <br>It was not, reread the manga or at least Fate vs Rakan. Tertium was confirmed to be the strongest Fate, and as the Fate of earth, he had more physical strength than the other clones. Rakan's physical strength and durability is one of his greatest strength, Negi is absolutely not as strong as him in that department. I don't know who has more strength between Negi and Fate but Jack is above both.</br></br>  <br> Anything wrong <br>Maybe Homura summoned them.</br></br>  <br><br> Ignores direct evidence and brings up irrelevant shit <br><br>Yeah, get over it. Fate and Negi are pretty much Rakan's equals in physical strength near the end of the manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's because you think it's irrelevant that you don't get this scene. And he says just now, do you believe his physical strength suddenly increased or what? You are just a Negi fanboy.</br>  <br>I thought that was the whole fucking point of a power up after mastering ME? goddamn anon learn to fucking read</br>  <br><br>RT2 Negi just started fighting Fate with his fists just then during the fight, you idiot. Fate makes a comment that Negi's punch is far stronger than Quintum's earlier as well, who he compared unfavorably to Rakan. <br><br>No matter how you cut it, Fate directly compared his strength to Rakan's. Rakan not being the absolute strongest is sad, but facts are facts.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And for how long was he fighting Fate in ME?</br>  <br><br> &gt;I wonder if it's like the thing Rakan fought. <br> that's actually an impressive callback. <br>I wonder if they are a standard protection tool for interesting sites.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is Kuro with them now? Is that how her power worked? I can't remember.</br>  <br> Kirië's blushing face is love here. <br>Indeed. I didn't notice that.</br></br>  <br>she was touching him, so he appeared at the save point too.<br><br>I think it would be best that maybe only kirie resets and let kuromaru and touta fight, as they die and recover over and over they¡'ll get used to the guy and beat it.</br></br></br>  <br>With how quickly that thing blew them out, I'd get the feeling it'd take both quite a long while to regenerate from that. And following their regeneration, it'd probably insta-gib them again in an endless cycle of death and reincarnation.</br>  <br><br>loved this moment.</br></br>  <br>This. The series was missing something from the beginning. I'm not sure, but whatever it was, it's starting to get it.</br>  <br> Adad in Akkadian and Ishkur in Sumerian and Hadad in Aramaic and &gt;Arabic language, are the names of the storm-god in the Akkadian, &gt;Assyrian and Babylonian </br>  <br> thunder spirt <br>THUNDER IS NOT LIGHTNING<br><br>NOT SO VERY FRIGHTENING</br></br></br></br>  <br>without lightning there is no Thunder.<br>which means he is also a lightning spirit.<br>Thats basic.</br></br></br>  <br>Touta will pull a Rakan.</br>  Touta will go Raiten Taisou by absorbing the next lightning blast with his magia erebea.  <br>Prove it motherfucker. Asuna says that Negi and the person he loves are alike and I can't think of anyone as similar mentally to Negi in Negima than her.</br>  <br>It could be Yue, you know. They're both brainiacs as far as Asuna's concerned.</br>  <br>That's true, but she loved Negi but the Epilogue rejects both her and Nodoka.</br>  <br><br>For all we know he didn't survive it and only saved them the second time because of a timing coincidence. Like the first time he was observing it for a while, maybe got his ass murdered a few times, then buggered off to rethink his strategy.</br></br>  <br>She need to win and i want her to win but she gonna get cucked</br>  <br>He needs to protect this smile</br>  <br>doesn´t matter if she realy dies.<br>Her second ability is reincarnation.</br></br>  <br><br>I am just here for Negi and wanting to kill myself the further on I go with UQ. I don't give a fuck who wins.</br></br>  <br>It doesn't fucking matter.<br><br>Listen: Power levels DO NOT FUCKING MATTER ANYMORE.<br><br>The enemy Touta's group is fighting can kill them in one hit, and Kuro can likely kill it in one hit.<br><br>So it doesn't matter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He is a exorcist of course he could kill a Spirit.<br>It´s his fucking job.<br>There is a differents between could kill and can kill.<br>every Shinmei-ryū swordsman could kill Negi with the right technique but almost no one can.So power levels do matter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, Touta is too weak to do that, he will have to pull something with his friends to trick the spirit so either he or Kuro can do something.</br>  <br>Touta now has a lot of smiles he has to protect... sadly that means that the boy will fail to protect all of them.</br>  <br>Nah, Touta will beat this guy be rebouncing his attack with his new counter move.</br>  <br>Of course.But he could feel it in the air when he got attacked.</br>  <br>I think that was the static elec from the thunder blast coming to them. Or maybe Touta having good senses?</br>  <br>high level but not the highest yet its as strong as negi who was the strongest ...................................<wbr></wbr></br>  <br>  strongest <br>unlikely. And as strong is kinda vague. itý most likely Magia erebia Negi without his speels just good old punching.</br></br>  <br>I don't believe what inexperienced people say anon, it's called being gullible.</br>  <br><br><br> Is this the guy that Rakan references when he talks about why he can count Negi based on his lightning trails? <br>this was my first thought<br><br>and it seems like the dungeon is the "noctis labyrint dungeon" maybe touta will get another ME upgrade or some kind of artifact, hell maybe the spirit has become one of rakans friends<br><br>got i love these little references</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Negi can't be killed because he's fucking immortal you idiot Against any other entity, something like ZnT would be a kill.<br><br>Why the hell are you so peeved at the idea of there being an entity as powerful as Negi? As powerful as Negi doesn't mean as unkillable as Negi.<br><br>There is absolutely no reason to doubt, or even be upset, at the idea of there being a high level thunder spirit that's as powerful as Negi was. Negi's strength was his intelligence and immortality, not his raw power output.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It´s the ultimate Spirit of Lightning.<br>is now everything fine? The chapter before we got a Rakan reference and know this.coincident? i think not.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe they are in the past, back in the day where Nagi and friends where active, so maybe Touta will meet Rakan if he keeps running around the place.</br>  <br> Maybe they are in the past <br><br> touta and friends die a few more times  <br> suddenly a young rakan is there and helps them kill the spirit <br> this is the fight that rakan was referring to during the negi fight </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> a monster as powerful as Negi! <br>Would Akamatsu stop shitting on Negima already?<br>First Eva, now Negi, next what he's gonna do, tell us that Keitaro and Naru died?</br></br></br>  <br>But we knew of this guy from Negima, Rakan mentioned him when he fought Negi so it's just a callback. Get over yourself.<br><br><br>Yep, that would be a great twist, and I bet that Rakan and Touta would just get along like best bros.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  It's like he doesn't give a fuck about Negima. <br>Bingo.<br> ell the fact that Eva is a totally different character(in personality) <br>Don't forget the looks, Adult Eva looks nowhere near her Negima princess-like self.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Why the hell are you so peeved at the idea of there being an entity as powerful as Negi <br>I am not.I don´t care about Power Levels.<br>But Negi is a Demon that's why I thought a Swordsmanship which is specialized at slaying Demons<br>could kill him.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Adult Eva looks nowhere near her Negima princess-like self. <br>because eva is immitating her own mother<br>do you even read the manga or are you only here to shitpost?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Just ignore him, he is just being annoying.</br></br>  Negi being as strong as the ultimate spirit of lightning is fine. The strongest entities are likely spirits. People find it odd because Negi was the third/fourth strongest character in Negima and they're obviously going to beat it - we already have Dana clearly being stronger than Negi. <br><br>It's unlikely they're in the past and Rakan will show up, though.</br></br>  <br>Negi's not a demon. He's an immortal monster. So resilient, that the Mage of the Beginning desired him as a potential permanent host. If mere demons could attain such immortality, the Mage would've just gone for one of them. Negi is a true monster, on a level that surpasses even demons. At least in terms of immortality. Not power.<br><br><br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same "EVA'S HAIR IS CHANGED FOR NO REASON IT'S RUINED FOREVER" autist who shit up UQ threads for months and months on end when the manga first started.</br></br></br></br></br>  ITT: critically-acclaimed and beloved movies/series you just can't get into  Spice and Wolf.<br>I'm reading Kino now and it's good though.</br>  Almost everything by Miyazaki.  <br>Really? What Miyazaki films have you enjoyed?<br><br>Spice and Wolf also isn't my favorite, but I did "get into it" I guess.</br></br></br>  I find its voice acting weird.  Yotsuba. <br>I loved Azumanga Daioh though. Maybe one day.</br>  I still like posting this gif though.  NGE<br>I understand the importance, I get why it is praised.<br>Not trying to be some contrarian just for the sake of it and it's not a backlash reaction to the fanbase and following, which can be quite obnoxious sometimes.<br>I just don't feel it.</br></br></br>  i found the first season to be incredibly boring, pretty okay ending however.<br><br>didn't even bother finishing the second season  even though i tell people i did </br></br>  <br> Really? What Miyazaki films have you enjoyed? <br>I'm thankful to him for Lupin, even if it's overall watered down it's a high quality movie compared to so much trash franchise had to deal with and Miyazaki probably had a long term positive effect on the franchise.<br>Mononoke was great looking and engaging.<br><br>Rest is usually just great looking.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lain a cute, A CUTE.</br>  <br>Same.<br>With how much I've had to read/hear about it probably know the second season better than most people who finished it.</br></br>  New chapters were released, I don't understand why anyone would waste their time with the anime.   people thought the university girls were evil <br><br>It's called School Life for a reason. They need a school to live in.</br></br>  Reminder that all Gurashis are pure  Now what will be the next conflict? The uni girls realizing that they weren't just being cute with the bear, but that they're actually treating it as a human? The other gang forcing their way in? Or something else?<br><br>Also, I hope one of the uni girls comments on Kurumi always having her shovel around.</br></br>  <br>Left one had at least 10000 dicks.<br>Middle one had around 10 dicks.<br>Right one had no more than 1000 dicks.<br>Am right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Right one had 1000 different dildos and sex toys.</br>  Why is Yuki so shit?

The girls would be forced to retreat back to the bunker they went to last time. I expected the bunker was designed to give the girls an out, as otherwise they would have nowhere to go. Maybe one uni girl would survive and go with them, but I don't expect that.</br></br>  <br>We got to know the uni girls more and vidya references.

Most of the stuff in the chapter can be easily inferred with the help of some indirect/efficient storytelling, the only thing we got from the chapter is that the uni girls seem to basically be good people and aren't planning shit.</br>  I don't want the uni girls to die.   you'll never get drunk with the uni sluts <br>What purpose is there in not being a zombie?</br>  <br>ENOUGH, Rii. This farce needs to END.</br>  <br> the only thing we got from the chapter is that the uni girls seem to basically be good people and aren't planning shit. <br><br>They're definitely hiding something at the least.</br></br></br>  <br>Glasses is so fucking scared of losing her comfy life she's gonna be planning something soon.</br>  <br> So actually nothing happened. Bummer. <br>The show is not an action series. The girls are trying to live as normal a life as they can despite the craziness outside. If anything the theme is they are all denying reality, because the alternative is going crazy for real and kill themselves. Like that one girl who walked outside because she couldn't handle it anymore.<br><br>The girls are trying to stay as happy as they can, because despair would kill them faster than zombies could.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop being such a massive tool, shovel.</br>  <br>I feel like they're being TOO obvious with Ruu being a bear. It makes me think that we're all just being rused.</br>  <br>I don't think anyone wants that but we're going to see at least one death.</br>  <br>Maybe but the last page implies they aren't being two-faced. If anything it might be a DARK PAST secret or some other shit, but nothing more than that.</br>  <br><br>Why did your posts remind me of Captain America?</br></br>  <br><br>What, you mean you guys don't already have the 3 and a half minute long, 1920x1200 resolution, 60 fps video?</br></br>  <br>They're going to do something in the next chapter, as indicated when glasses said "she'll start doing her best tomorrow."<br><br>Also, what does Hikari do? I'm assuming she's the one that guards their shit?</br></br></br>  <br> I feel like they're being TOO obvious with Ruu being a bear. It makes me think that we're all just being rused. <br>It isn't meant to be a secret. It is meant to raise the tension of WHEN the others would have to break in the bad news, or if Big Sister would deteriorate further.</br></br>  <br>Isn't it only 2 minutes and 25 seconds?</br>  <br>I feel the same about megu-nee in the anime.</br>   Kurumi is the primary hitter (can we call her Kuu already?) <br> Mii can hold her own in combat <br> Yuki can fight too if needed (can't we call her Yuu?) <br> Aki is probably the most /fit/ out of all uni girls <br> Hika can probly use engineering tools in zombie fight <br><br>What can glasses and Rii do?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mine's 3:38 long. Though I just realized there's another version on his website, but I don't think it can be shorter in length, because it's about the same filesize.</br>  <br>It's a five second looped webm. It's not even at 1920x1200 resolution. http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51591398</wbr></br>  <br>The tension isn't coming from us not knowing she's a bear and then suddenly revealing it, it's supposed to come from us noticing and always keeping in the back of our minds Rii's mental state and how everyone around her treats her.<br><br>It's damn good storytelling in my opinion.</br></br></br>  <br> glasses <br>Maybe the uni girls all have weapons designed by Hika.<br> Rii <br>Go crazy</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, scratch that. It is 2 minutes and 25 seconds like you said. http://www.kaitsushin.com/blog/</br>  <br> implying the car wasn't used by them to lure them in <br>they're evil alright</br></br>  <br><br>Those are samples. The full versions are in the mega link below the videos.</br></br>  <br> uni girls have weapons <br><br>Make sense, considering how the boys are STILL kept out of the Uni for so long despite having means to retake all the comfort, running water, and working generator/solar cell<br><br>Previuosly the gurashis were holding fort against zombies, this time they're holding against armed mobs?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well shit, didn't even think to check below the videos.</br>  I don't understand this picture.<br><br>Also, I wonder how the uni sluts survived at at all. Hika was responsible somehow, but they don't even have a decent shovel to whack zombies with.</br></br>  <br> having a WiiU </br>  <br>I don't think the boys know the girls have all that. I don't care how many weapons they have, If the boys really wanted to take over the girls they definitely could. They have a big manpower advantage.</br>  <br>Since I'm feeling nice, the password is inaka. I can't download the updated kurumiHD2 video for whatever reason, though.</br>  <br>I thought Splatoon needed an online connection to function in multiplayer.<br><br>Does this mean Nintendo servers didn't get affected by the zombies?</br></br></br>  <br>The zombies go home and play video games every now and then.</br>  <br>So many different rooms with TVs.<br><br>How luxurious.</br></br></br>  <br>Say what you want, but the Wii U has games.<br><br>All this Shovel and Megu-nee fanart makes me hopeful for good Mii-kun fanart next week.</br></br></br>  <br> Tofu Mii-kun. <br> Zombie = Bio = Tofu <br><br>What?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Japanese NEETs survived a zombie outbreak by being NEETs.</br>  <br>So shy girl is an engineering major.</br>  <br>Realistically, if you've barricaded yourself in your room with enough supplies not to leave for months on end, you're in a pretty good position when it happens.</br>  <br> yfw Yuki(stupid) or Rii(broken) accidently revealed to the outside that they have power and running water inside the Uni (maybe by setting up light show on the rooftop at night for "festival"/Ruu asked) <br> yfw it all TUMBLING DOWN TUMBLING DOWN TUMBLING DIWN </br></br>  Is it Miki or Mii-kun?  <br>Realistically, your home is not zombie-proof, with or without barricades.<br><br><br>This picture exists, yet there's still no Shovel Chiyo.</br></br></br></br>  Yuki has the best fanart.  Would the girls be getting raped in any other zombie story?  <br>2 girls in the left, 1 guy in the middle, and 2 guys to the right.<br><br>One of the women looks like she has long curly hair.

Because of the hose. I see, very smart (lol).</br>  Well, an underground bunker for a university must have way more food and supplies and space compared to a local highschool so I don't think anyone is gonna run out of food anytime soon.  Gakkou Gurashi guest appearance on Wooser when?  <br>What's Wooser even about?</br>  <br> Realistically, your home is not zombie-proof, with or without barricades. <br>Funny enough I know many homes in Asia probably ARE zombie proof, just because there is so much concrete, earthquake resistant reinforcement, and metal barriers to prevent burglary. The main issue is there is not enough room to store food supplies, the population density means even more zombies per square inch, and you are probably a long way away from farmland.</br></br>  Have you already prayed to megu-nee today, /a/non?  <br>What a waste of a nice body, she died without knowing the all mighty D.</br>  <br>Now you don't know that at all.</br>  The next incident isn't coming from the zombies, but from the other group who will try to get in the university. I'm telling you.  <br>No but it would be extremely painful</br>  <br><br>She died pure. PURE!</br></br>  <br>Yuki gave it to her</br>  <br>She was gangraped by vorefags. She wasn't pure when they were done.</br>  <br>To be fair they only bit her in the arm.</br>  <br>Then explain this.</br>   Zonbi no ecchi!   <br>corpses rot away over time.</br>  <br><br>Cancer. This community is cancer. "Slut", "raped", "wants the D", "Miki is a boy". You are all pure cancer.</br></br>  <br>we love you too, anon.</br>  <br>She was a good wholesome unmarried Catholic girl.  She only did anal. </br>  <br> Miki would have had the time of her life had she met megu-nee. </br>  <br>Now you know the truth, you're able to leave this hell and live the life you ever dreamed of, or just commit Seppuku, whatever you feel like it</br>  <br>I'd stop coming back here if there was a decent place to discuss anime. Lesser of many evils.</br>  <br>It's called friends.</br>  I just sat and read the everything up to the latest chapter, I now feel really depressed. I wish I could give all these girls a hug  <br>They all hate on Miki. The poor girl did nothing wrong</br>  <br>Then you're gonna stay here forever, any other place besides here is /b/-tear, and that's saying something, but here, have an eyepatch Mi-kun</br>  <br>Yuki is so cute, I can't get enough of her. I want more Yuki/Miki Senpai/Kouhai interactions so badly.</br>  <br>She's so cute. Miki, Yuki, Kurumi, they're all too cute!</br>  Goddammit I was just about to see our beloved sensei get shoveled in the face when mangahere went down. Now I can't read with the stupid overlay tsukkomis (they are my bros for life) to accompany my autism.<br><br>EDIT: It's back now. That was a long 13 minutes of despair.</br></br>  <br>Aren't you missing someone?</br>  <br>...Not really my type, I'm sorry.<br><br>Unless you were referring to Megu-nee. Megu-nee is cute, too!</br></br></br>  <br>What the actual fuck is this?</br>  <br>What is that expression supposed to be?</br>  <br>Something I really, really hope the anime will do properly. The faces so far have been good, but this is a different level.</br>  <br>Oh wait. You meant the faggot using mangahere.</br>  <br/>    <br>Not Miki.

Anyone else feel the same?</br>  <br>Aki is the best uni slut.</br>  <br>I think this arc is going to be about bridging the gap between the uni girls and the other group, which will probably cover developing Kurumi and Hika's conditions, and then they'll have enough people to get to Randall.</br>  <br>There's only one thing to be done  NORMIES REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE GET OUT OF MY ROOM FUCKING NORMIES. </br>  <br>I think it's more likely that one of the Uni girls will die because of Ruu and that will snap Rii out of it.</br>    <br>Hello /r9k/, my old friend.<br><br> Just kidding, I don't have any friends. <br><br>Gekko Gouda Cheese episode 4 soon.</br></br></br></br></br>  Megu-nee, wake UP  Glasses is the best thing to happen to this show  <br>I can't wait for the Randall arc. It's going to be the best.</br>  <br>As someone who's apart of the water and celery master race I tell those fat whores with disgusting eating and drinking habits to leave.</br>    <br>I don't know, the best thing about this manga is them struggling to lead as normal lives as they can given their current situation. If it turns into a story arc about figuring out the truth of the incident or finding a way to save Kurumi I think it'll lost a large part of its charm.</br>  <br>Those girls are thin as shit, nigga.</br>  <br>Sure they are fatty.</br>  <br>The third of October can't come soon enough.</br>  <br>It's not even eight of clock anon. She doesn't have to go to school yet.</br>  <br>It might or might not lose its charm. Either way, the Randall plot has been heavily foreshadowed. Eventually, they're going to go there to investigate the incident, whether we like it or not.</br>  <br>There's a reasonable chance they aren't really normalfags. Hika seems like an engineering student and / or tech otaku. Aki might have been a normie, but she probably has been converted already.</br>  I want to get beaten down to a pulp by yuki  <br>I want to be Yuki. If I put on a pink wig and a cat hat, can I beat you down?</br>  <br>She's not Koume. She can wake up whenever she wants.</br>  <br>A cute hat and wig won't hide the fact that you're old, fat and disgusting!</br>  <br>No homo</br>  <br><br>But we're all cute girls here.</br></br>  <br>Kurumi and Miki's smiles will make up for anything.</br>  <br>I'm kind of unsure that Ruu is a bear, she might be something else.<br>Re-reading the part where crossbow-kun tries to shoot Ruu seemed kind of weird if Ruu was just a teddy bear.</br></br>  <br>He didn't try to shoot Ruu, he shot Yuuri because he told them to drop everything and she didn't.<br><br> I bet he gets a scratch and comes begging to the other group when he gets kicked out. </br></br></br>  <br>You're right, she's one of the lizard men that unleashed the plague in the first place and is mind controlling Rii.<br><br> She's the fucking bear, mate. </br></br></br>  <br>How long do we have to wait until we see yuki completely lose it? Or has she passed that stage permanently already? With the manga looking like it's still has a lot more to show I want to see more despaired breakdowns</br>  <br>Crossbow-kun wasn't trying to shoot the Ruu, what the fuck is wrong with you. He freaked out because Rii wouldn't drop it, he was aiming for her.</br>  <br>It works well enough for Yuki. She has hair sticking out of her ears, obvious old man in disguise.</br>  <br><br>Thats what I thought at first, but when Kurumi blocks his bolt and is approaching towards him, he was really hesitant to shoot her.<br>Unless he only had one bolt, but I thought I recalled him loading another.</br></br></br>  <br>He just saw what Kurumi did, of course he was hesitant to shoot again.</br>  <br>Of course he's hesitant, a potential zombie just made an impossible block and is now advancing towards him while rolling to intimidate.</br>  <br><br>That fucking matrix bullshit is the only part of the manga I disliked. She fucking threw a shovel at an arrow in midflight and blocked it, what the fuck.</br></br>  <br>She's gone full Alice.</br>  <br>indeed mistranslation.</br>  I want to fuck Aki.  <br>What does it say?</br>  <br>and also mind the text on the top left hand corner of the page.. (sorry that the image is rotated</br>  <br>"Is that, the legendary big five of Megurigaoka?"<br><br>Battle shounen arc incoming.</br></br></br>  <br> Is that the armed fighting faction? <br><br>something like that</br></br></br>  <br>No, shovel failed to block the arrow. The arrow simply missed. The shovel thrown out hurt Ri-san's leg.</br>  <br>Your blind anon. The arrow stopped in front of Rii, so it was stopped by Kurumi.</br>  <br>Where do you find the passwords for the rest of the stuff in the page?</br>  <br><br>yeah she threw the shovel<br>she is defenseless now</br></br></br>  <br>and,</br>  <br>It goes skidding off in the complete opposite direction she threw it, while the bolt stops. She blocked it.<br><br><br>She picked it up again.</br></br></br></br>  Is tolerance for the mentally ill a major sub-theme for this manga?<br><br>It showed Yuki was acting loony within limits of reason, and now Rii-san-chan has been traumatized and everyone's trying to help her along.</br></br>  <br>Look anon I know you don't have any so you wouldn't get it but that's what friends do for each other.</br>  <br>I mean there won't be anything on the level of classroom scene. She might despair for other reasons like people dying and such but the breaking down due to delusions is already a checked box</br>  <br>The passwords I've found are inaka, mikkago, nyaa, paradise, and kaitsushin. The first two are for the newer stuff and the latter three are for the older stuff. Just keep on trying until one of them works.</br>  <br><br>Lol what, he obviously shot "Ruu" (i.e. the bear). He was just trying to disarm Rii so he shot the place where she could potentially be hiding something, the fucking scene implies this by having him shot "Ruu" and having Rii step in to "block" the shot.<br><br>You two should reread that part.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you.</br>  <br> Look anon I know you don't have any so you wouldn't get it but that's what friends do for each other. <br>Yeah but now there's these new chicks and there's a good chance that they might shove Rii's face rudely into reality if they're not as kind, observant and tolerant as Miki was</br></br>  <br>Lol what? I think you need to reread it. He shot at Rii because paranoia gripped him when she wouldn't drop the bear.</br>  <br><br>see distance between the arrows' shadow and shovel's shadow. Plus the arrow is going down head-first so it have not been rebounce before it fall.</br></br>  <br>He literally explains that he shot because you can't trust anyone not to be infected / a zombie.</br>  She's dead already, isn't she?<br><br>It makes no sense they'd find her out there just like that.<br><br>And it seemed like only Yukki saw her.</br></br></br></br>  So the gist of the whole university matter is this:<br> big five started taking extreme measures to stop people from getting infected <br> the three girls at the university got bitten, used the serum and got superpowers like Kurumi, which is why they're able to hold their ground against them <br>So, battle shonen arc incoming?</br></br></br>  <br>True enough. But they don't know the bear is Rii's pretend sister yet, just that the girls call it "Ruu".</br>  <br><br>Look at where the emphasis is placed. This repeats in the first page of the next chapter and that also has a panel with Rii "covering" for Ruu.<br><br>He shot to disarm her and his bullshit explanation was just about trusting/mistrusting people, not about whether shooting the infected is mandatory.<br><br>Also the translation of that dialogue is fucked because the retard who translated the chapter was in full delusion about Ruu being real and interpreted the dialogue according to his headcanon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yes </br>  <br>See the fact that the shovel fucking spins out in the opposite direction it was thrown. The bolt collided with the shovel, rebounded, and fell. How do you think a shot that a page ago was aimed directly at her heart is suddenly falling to the ground some distance away, a sudden downdraft?</br>  <br> &gt;the three girls at the university got bitten, used the serum and got superpowers like Kurumi, which is why they're able to hold their ground against them <br>There is nothing to suggest any of this. All that's been said is that they had a disagreement and left.</br></br>  <br>The shovel touched the arrow, and the impact makes the shovel change direction and fly towards Rii, while the arrow falls to the ground. The panel shows you the moment right after the shovel and the arrow impacted each other.</br>  <br><br><br>Why no decent scans yet?</br></br></br>  <br>Seeing as the helmet bros and guy with crossbow were pretty paranoid about people getting infected, it's a pretty reasonable assumption that something more than a simple disagreement happened here.</br>  <br>Of course she's covering her, they're both standing next to each other and being shot at. I doubt she had the time to think about where exactly it's being aimed.</br>    <br>Maybe they just have the same policy as Yuki.</br>  <br> How the hell did you do this? </br>  <br>A disagreement about what to do with people who were very slightly wounded. The last page of this chapter shows Hika (I think) with a bandaid. I doubt it'll go battle shounen, but it seems likely that one of more of them have had some contact with the virus.</br>  <br>I agree. One of them might have been bitten, but there's nothing to suggest that yet. It just as well could have been that one of their friends was killed or expelled for suspected infection and they broke off because of that.<br><br> In fact, if one of them had been bitten and the other group new about it, there's no way the Uni girls would still be aloud to live in the campus with how paranoid the other group is.</br></br></br>  <br>If shovel had time to calculate and throw the shovel, then Rii damn sure had the time to see where the arrow was going. This doesn't even require thinking, it's instinctive. Try throwing something against a wall and have it bounce back, the position it's going towards is impossible to miss especially if it's below your eyeline.<br><br>The first anon thought it was weird Crossbow dude would shoot "Ruu" if it was just a bear, which also shows he interpreted the scene as him shooting there (the correct way to interpret it, that's what the panneling and composition is asking you to do). The explanation is very simple (he shot to disarm).</br></br></br>  <br>I want to cum inside this little delusional semen demon.</br>  <br> The last page of this chapter shows Hika (I think) with a bandaid <br>I think it's Aki.</br></br>  <br> If shovel had time to calculate and throw the shovel, then Rii damn sure had the time to see where the arrow was going <br>I don't think Rii had time to calculate anything. She just covered her "sister" by instinct.</br></br>  <br>Shovel is hopped up on zombie juice and going Alice on us.</br>  <br>"He's aiming for me, not the bear right next to me" is not instinctive. "I'm being shot at, I need to protect my little sister" is. What Kurumi did is pretty clearly impossible for a normal human, so bringing that up isn't really relevant. The entire conversation with Kurumi being angry and him saying that anyone could be infected makes no sense if everyone is aware that he wasn't aiming to kill or wound, and neither does the previous chapter's cliffhanger.</br>  <br> If shovel had time to calculate and throw the shovel <br>And why do you think that is?</br></br>  All hail Megu-nee.  <br>Why weren't my teachers this cute and sweet when I was in high school?</br>  <br> everyone is aware that he wasn't aiming to kill or wound <br>I never said everyone was aware of this, much less consider the situation rationally (not even the dude was calm there). They perceive hostility from him and he won't back up, but he didn't shoot to kill. The fact he didn't shoot to kill is not even the point of the scene, just something that we readers infer from knowing (assuming) Ruu is not real (otherwise he'd have shot to kill of course).</br></br>  <br> Having a Mega Drive <br>I found my waifu now</br></br>  <br>would you kiss an infected ?</br>  <br>A lot of your teachers probably had been like that in the past. It's a stage that lasts about a year at most before the cold hard reality of teaching horrible children finally grinds down their will.</br>  <br>Why japanese people keep tissues everywhere ?</br>  <br>Will I get superpowers too?</br>  <br>Fapping is their national sport.</br>  <br>Because they're not disgusting foreign barbarians who wallow in their own filth.  Depravity club were constantly reaffirming their comradery with eachother </br>  <br>Only if it was Kurumi.</br>  <br>Yes, in more places than just 1.</br>  <br> all that shit in your notification bar <br> over 100 tabs in chrome <br> the shittiest, lowest possible quality manga reader website <br> chink shit <br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If that person is anything like me then 100 tabs is perfectly reasonable.</br>  Next chapter can't come soon enough. I need the Gurashis being comfy.  <br><br>Wait, Ruu is real?</br></br>  <br>Are hese the girls that trade sex for food.</br>  <br>Aki is.</br>  <br>I'm actually getting kinda attached to Ruu, I don't want her to go away.</br>  <br>Yuki does all the speaking for Ruu and when she says "You're energetic" she's talking about Yuki. Ruu is confirmed for bear. </br>  Megu-ne died right? Was it off panel or something? Sorry if it's obvious but I want to know how she went.  <br>Gangbanged by a whole lot of smelly rotten zombie penises.</br>  <br>See </br>  <br>It wasn't outright said how, but it was implied she was bit while trying to get the others girls to safety in the broadcast room after the zombies somehow got through their barricade.</br>  So wait, Yuki is sane since they left the school?

Apparently, they are heading to a place where (as Alibaba has told Judar many times by this point) they can find someone with the power to send them back to their world. He doesn’t know where that is, though, as he just heard he had to aim for a rift in the land.  <br> Judar is intrigued by this “I heard it from someone”, and thinks that certainly Alibaba is... but he doesn’t answer his question, and since he can't read Alibaba's non-existent face, he gets really annoyed. <br> They apparently fight, and their fight leads them to: <br><br> Mother Dragon: We have guests, I see? <br> Alibaba: We were looking for you. My name is Alibaba. What’s your name? <br> Mother Dragon: Long forgotten. But you can call me how Solomon did, Mother Dragon. <br><br> Alibaba reminds Judar that she appeared in Aladdin’s tale about Alma Torran, a name the the dragon finds nostalgic. Still, Judar blatantly and rudely asks her to go straight to the point and tell them how to go back. <br> She tells them they are at the “bottom” of the world, and that they came there through a rift in the dimensions. The dragon has been overlooking Solomon’s new world from here, and the black shadow looming over it, which Alibaba explains is what he wants to stop. <br> The dragon exclaims that Alibaba is strange. He is still young, yet has the presence of an old sage. Alibaba tells her that before, when he became a spirit, he spent what seemed like a hundred years somewhere else, and it was there that he heard about the dragon from a certain someone. <br> She then proceeds to explain that it’s funny that they are talking about “going back” when they actually are in their world. Judar immediately dismisses this as a lie, as the rukh there is all black and it’s totally different from their world. She explains however that this is just the old Alma Torran “attached” to the new world. In other words, the Dark Continent (which seems to be about twice as big as the known world). </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dump?</br>  <br>Nah, go read it here if you want<br>http://www.mangamint.com/magi-275-m<wbr>agi</wbr></br></br>  <br> which seems to be about twice as big as the known world <br><br>More like ten as big.</br></br></br>  <br>is that hunter x hunter all over again</br>  Like the heading mentioned, it is a compatibility and affinity test, its more like what character traits fit into which rukh type the most, it is not a identical 100% match but maybe like a good 70-80% match?

Like it said here" Judar starts to wonder what is Alibaba now ever since being taken out by Hakuryuu, what happened to him between then and now".</br>  <br>Blame Sinbad for being too broken. Without off-screen development Alibaba would never catch up to him.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>I honestly don't see anyone beating Sinbad in a one-vs-one fight. If anything it would still be an everyone vs Sinbad fight.<br><br>Especially once he goes full David.</br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't need to catch up to Sinbad, and if he does, he will be just a Gary Stu, as he will be Sinbad but without all the bad shit like being a manipulative fucker or final boss.</br>  Reminder that Alibaba technically was the first metal vessel user death   Alibaba is now older than Sinbad and Kouen <br>Thats neat.</br>  <br>Current Sinbad is not that strong, for example I think Aladdin plus Kouen ( or even only Aladdin) could defeat him right now.<br><br> Especially once he goes full David. <br><br>I have a theory that once Sinbad falls completely into depravity David will be awaked.</br></br></br></br></br>  I wonder how Judar will change after all this. We all know Alibaba will still be just Alibaba but wiser.  <br>fuck off, you got your shoujo-bait sinbad spin-off.</br>  <br> Alibaba tells her that before, when he became a spirit, he spent what seemed like a hundred years somewhere else, and it was there that he heard about the dragon from a certain someone. <br>Is this suppose to ring some bells? Or is Alibaba saying since Hakuryuus fight it seems as if its been 100 years?</br></br>  I wonder what alibaba's plans for love are now.<br>Is he going to flip out even more because he'll be experiencing hormones and boners for the first time in a lifetime?<br>And has he finally realised his OTP is  Aladdin ?</br></br>  <br> this is just the old Alma Torran “attached” to the new world. In other words, the Dark Continent (which seems to be about twice as big as the known world). <br>And just why couldn't Aladdin get some idea and clue about where Alibaba was sent to after all that Solomon's wisdom?</br></br>  <br>Solomon didn't make the new world so he wouldnt know where it is.</br>  <br>Alibaba has shed his mortal body, and with it his mortal desires. <br><br>Boner has no more power over him.<br><br>Alibaba has become the superior existence David has been thinking about.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ugo*</br>  <br>yeah but his goal is to unshed it and climb back in his chemical suit.<br>I thought it might be like going off weed for a while to lose your built up tolerance.</br></br>  <br> Alibaba tells her that before, when he became a spirit, he spent what seemed like a hundred years somewhere else, and it was there that he heard about the dragon from a certain someone. <br>What does he mean "before"?<br>When he says "seemed like a hundred years" does that mean it literally went on for years of perceived time or was he just reallly bored?</br></br></br>   i still want to believe   <br>They are just too awesome for this gay world</br>  <br> What does he mean "before"? <br>Before metting the dragon<br><br> When he says "seemed like a hundred years" does that mean it literally went on for years of perceived time or was he just reallly bored? <br>Literally perceived 100 years.

Ohtaka pls</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They'll probably flash back to it.</br>  <br>The final stage of the arc, not the Kou Empire itself.</br>  <br><br>Probably just the end of the Kouen force expedition, they will now reply to Baldadd and keep themselve ready against the seven seas alliance coming.</br></br>  <br>I think my guess is right that the war would end up in talking and then the big black thing would come out with Alibaba.</br>  <br>  Is the anime worth watching? </br>  <br>How does that work when fights are going on in two different locations?</br>  BRAVO<br>R<br>A<br>V<br>O</br></br></br></br>  <br>well shit</br>  <br>Dat Judal face.</br>  <br>Just what the fuck is Alibaba doing with those balls?</br>  <br>face of a true man</br>  <br>there's no way in hell that that bitch is completely gone</br>  <br>These critters are kinda cute.</br>  <br>Koumei is a strategist. He is more inclined to use brains. Darius's vessel specialises in defense - it looks more like these forces are just to stop the fighting.</br>  The Great Rift and the Dark Continent are different places, right?  <br>Well, isn't the great Rift just what separe the dark continent to the ..continent, the new world where the story take place? (is there a name for it?)</br>  <br>but hey went into space and to another planet,how can they be back on "Earth"?</br>  <br>Great Rift is the darkness in which the pretty magi has his house and the Dark Continent is when you cross that.<br><br>If you run the distance it goes like this : Known World &gt; Great Rift &gt; Dark Continent</br></br></br>  So, are we shifting back to the Kou war next week, or can we still get some spacebros?  I'll bet by bottom dollar that Alibaba is Solomon's reincarnation.  <br>Solomon isn't dead. He is now a god. Even David isn't dead - he is chilling with Illah.</br>  <br> Implying the early Kou War chapter threads weren't slow as fuck </br>   Your face when I told everyone in these threads that Magi was gonna pull a Shaman King by soul training and shit the first time we saw Alibaba in this form. <br><br> Your face when no one believed me. </br></br>  <br>I think I remember someone talking about that ages ago. That was you, huh?</br>  How old is Judal anyways?  <br>20</br>  <br>You don't gotta be dead to have a reincarnation. Just look at Inuyasha.</br>  <br>then why does he have the best physique of all the characters</br>  <br>he is weak despite his fake abs, Ohtaka confirmed that. Even Aladdin is better at sports than him.</br>  <br>You're joking, right?</br>  Alibaba have traspassed the power of the rukh  <br> Alibaba is a 100+ year-old virgin </br>  <br>he has transcended jobber status</br>  <br>IS he really a hundred years old now?</br>  So if Alibabas body is dead then it means he's gonna have a new one and how he will obtain it?  <br>That depends on your definition of "age" I guess</br>  <br>The dragon will probably give him a new body.</br>  <br>Say, a century-old sage spirit in a 20 year-old body.</br>  That dragon is uguu as fuck  <br>Was she so powerfull? I can't remember. What role she had in alma toran arc anyway?</br>  <br><br><br>Well Chinese people prefer cremation.<br><br>However, Chinese people love phoenixes and this arc is very Chinese, so either Alibaba revives from the flames or Alibaba forms his body from the mud of the Dark Continent since a lot of creation mythology have mankind be formed from mud and soil.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> His new body will be immortal <br> He's gonna look like another Sinbad <br>  Ofc face will be ten times more handsome than Sinbads and Koens together </br></br></br>  <br>you're joking,right?<br><br>Sinbad is litterally David with eyebrows</br></br></br>  <br> Hakuryuu thought he killed Alibaba <br> Instead he turned him into a demi-god while he became Sinbad's bitch </br></br>  <br>Fuck Sinbads thing, better just make BABA a shota.<br> So when he reunite with Aladdin we gonna have the shota duo.</br></br>  Sage or not, he's still Alibaba. I bet he's going to appear buttnaked in the battlefield.  <br>With tits.</br>  <br><br> alibaba returns as a busty maiden that catches the attention of sinbad, koen, and aladdin  <br><br>we want alibaba to suffer.<br><br>not kill himself.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Implying you don't want a Futababa x Sinbad doujin   <br>Stop it. I already fapped today.</br>  <br>Pretty sure he gonna get on the stage acting like the new hot shit, all that to get stolen the show like a bitch half a minute later, probably by Solomon, david or gyokuen. That why I love him.</br>  <br>Ohtaka wants to confuse your dick even more.</br>  <br><br>We all know Sharrkan will fight Sinbad to the death to protect the purity of his newly changed and confused student.<br><br>Then he'll resume their training in some personal 1 on 1 sword lessons later.</br></br></br></br>  Wait. Hakuryuu tested Belial out on other people and killed them too, right? So how come they aren't wizards like Alibaba is now?  <br>They didn't find a way.</br>  <br>Alibaba talked about seeing someone who guided him before he encountered Judar. I guess that someone didn't give two shits about everyone else aside from Alibaba.</br>  <br>if you say so</br>  <br>so</br>  <br>They won't come back until at least a year has passed.</br>  <br>That wouldn't make any sense. To maximize dramatic tension, Alibaba should get there right when the war is about to begin.</br>  <br>That wouldn't make any sense either, since it's been established that time works by a very different metric in wherever Alibaba and Judar are.</br>  <br>We have no idea how the time flaws there, which allows Otaka to make Alibaba appear in Balabad whenever is most convenient for the plot. And it's most convenient for him to get there right when the war is starting, for maximum dramatic effect.</br>  <br>Why does my dick feel funny when I look at that image?</br>  <br><br>I highly doubt he has actually experienced 100 years of time there.<br><br>If he did then he wouldn't act the same as he always does around Judar.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They aren't main characters.<br><br>By which I mean, they weren't virgins.</br></br></br>  <br> dat picture <br>The greatest tragedy of Magi is that this pairing will never happen.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, he'll return as a girl with a flatter chest than Morgannia.</br>  <br>At least that ship's fate is sealed. I'm still waiting to sink on this one.</br>  <br>I know right?<br>If Arba is coming back, I definitely want this to happen on some level or form. Otherwise there's no merit in her coming back.</br></br>  <br>Why would you want to destroy such a pure love?</br>  <br>Because I think Alibaba and Kougyoku are a better match for each other.</br>  S3 when?  <br>Will Fish Princess ever get a happy end?</br>  <br>As soon as the author draws more giant blue breasts for them to animate.</br>  <br><br> wanting used goods for Alibaba </br></br>  <br>Oh, I thought you meant you wanted to sink the Alibaba x Kougyoku ship.</br>  <br>I mean she's basically a female version of Alibaba without as much plot armor.<br>Expect suffering.<br><br> The pain only makes me stronger. </br></br></br></br>  <br> I mean she's basically a female version of Alibaba without as much plot armor. </br>  <br>I honestly couldn't care less but her attempts to win over Sinbad hardly justify calling her used goods. All of that was character development for her. It means that in the future she'll find true love rather than 1 sided infatuation. Or at least that's what it would mean if she were a main character.<br><br><br>I want the ship to prevail but I know it won't, the author is a Morgfag.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You just know Sin will mind-rape her into killing one of her brothers.</br>  If Alibaba just stayed on the dark continent for a couple more years and meditated more, he could become the Buddha and come back as an Asura.  <br>When the rights get handed to a competent studio.</br>  <br>I'm still salty about the introduction of mind control magic to this series.<br><br>It feels like such a blatantly overpowered plot device. It instantly defeats any enemy with little to no effort and no downside whatsoever.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, Sinbad himself is a blatantly overpowered plot device. That's why Alibaba suddenly became an old sage.</br>  <br> Sinbad himself is a blatantly overpowered plot device. <br>Being this stupid.</br></br>  <br>When he was born literally everyone in the world felt his presence. He has more magoi then 100 men and something like half a dozen metal vessels.<br><br>He doesn't even have a creative way of fighting like Kouen does to make himself powerful. He's just powerful because fuck it the universe decided it.</br></br></br>  I have a bad feeling about this guys.<br><br>Think about it. <br><br>Mother Dragon.<br><br>Mothers get pregnant.<br><br>Alibaba is currently a soul.<br><br>Mother Dragon needs to give birth in order to become a mother.<br><br>So, in other words, Alibaba requests to be Mother Dragon's son so he willingly launches himself into Mother Dragon's womb and then later hatches out from her egg and is reborn as a Dragon.<br><br>And since this Mother Dragon has dimensional powers, Alibaba will inherit her powers.<br><br>Screencap this if this becomes true.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you implying that Alibaba himself is the incarnation of a soul's sperm?</br>  <br> Veggibaba gets into the hyperbolic time chamber for a powerup  <br><br>lame</br></br></br>  <br>He literally is.</br>  <br>oh the anon who hates sinbad again</br>  <br>How does calling Sinbad overpowered equate to hating him? Are you a retard?</br>  I want Ill Illah on earth right fucking now.  http://magi.wikia.com/wiki/Gyokuen_<wbr>Ren<br><br> She is a thought projection of Arba, who has been sealed by Solomon Jehoahaz Abraham in another world with Ill Ilah and The Organization for one thousand years. <br><br>Source?</br></br></br></br></wbr>  All that's cool and everything but when will Simbad suffer?Everything goes well for him in this mango.  <br> Simbad <br>Who?</br></br>  <br>Ok, my bad. But you know who I'm talking about already.</br>  <br>Read Sinbad no bouken.<br/></br>  <br>That's why I said in this mango. Nothing bad happens to him in this manga and I don't like it.</br>  So Judar and alibaba are still on the same planet as everyone else? How does that work? Didn't Judar get spaced ad infinitum?  <br> If he did then he wouldn't act the same as he always does around Judar. <br>He doesn't act the same way as he did around Judar. Now he's always like "Is that so" to Judar's provocation.<br>Dude was seriously attempting to assault Kouen when he called him a cherryboi.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah calling him a character a plot device is not hating him at all</br>  <br>he has barely any panel time and he got robbed and almost got killed during the Balbad arc</br>  <br>They became the mobs.</br>  <br> the author is a Morgfag. <br>While Alibaba x Morgiana is the more likely to happen, you can hardly say she's a Morgfag, she's supposed to be one of the main character of the three yet do you remember the last time we saw here playing an important role in the story? me neither. <br><br>I say that as a Kougyoku x Alibaba shipper.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, Mor should be more relevant. <br><br>On the romance side of things, I'm all for AliMor. Kougyoku's a qt but Mor's had a crush on Alibaba since forever, and considering her past as a slave and all that, I really would like her to get what she wants.<br><br>Of course, before that she has to overcome her self-esteem issues, so she can start seeing Alibaba as an equal.</br></br></br></br></br>  Bump  <br> he has barely any panel time <br>Yet people think he is a plot device.</br></br>  <br> sinbad is never gonna get a magi </br>  <br>What a faithful husbando, he doesn't know that Sinbad is currently having a threesome with Hakuryuu and his neesan.</br>  <br>What else were you expecting, exactly? People were calling for Alibaba to get a power ip for months.</br>  <br>How old is Mor? I know Alibaba is around 20.</br>  <br>17, I think.</br>  <br>i was hoping he would stay in haniwa mode for the rest of the series.</br>  <br><br><br>Unless Ugo gave him something offscreen or the mother dragon is going to give him something beside returning them to the other side, wandering endless darkness slashing weak shits for about 100 years hardly counts as a "power up". I like how you automatically assume that with gaining a power up though, it's like generic battle shounen logic has become a section of your brains.</br></br></br>  <br>Idk its just when I hear "it felt like 100 years" my brain automatically deduces Hyperbolic Time Chamber plot devices.</br>  <br>Well, you shouldn't make that deduction unless it is confirmed by the author. Until such time, there is only assumption and speculation.</br>  <br>He can be so much more, anon.</br>  How does memory even work for a spirit? Does Alibaba remember everything perfectly or does he still have human limitations?  <br>Ohtera liked it.</br>  <br> The animation is so coooooool! <br>It was a bunch of stills.</br></br>  <br>Volume 7 is the final for Sinbad? Pretty short series, all things considering.</br>  <br>How many Djinns are we up to in SnB?</br>  <br>Because apparently he has the aura of a sage and Judal said he ahs changed? I mean it's character development off scree, ALibaba is more mature now</br>  <br><br> Final volume with a special limited edition cover </br></br>  Why Reina's voice is so goddamn awesome?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rLZ<wbr>NyCfdDbg</wbr>  [ ]</br>  I like better Kumiko's.<br>Her VA is awesome.</br>  <br>I also preferred Kumiko's voice however, when I heard them singing I must say Reina is better.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=cWj<wbr>4pag0X3g</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  This is the other song<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Egp<wbr>9Uo0C8YE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Because of her voice actor fantasizing about Kumiko while singing, according to her blog.  So guys, who's the strongest NasuVerse character?  <br>KNK is a bit closer to Tsukihime or Heavens Feel than UBW</br>  I'm not a fan of getting all these "I didn't like x will I like y" into Nasuverse interested. These are the types that will argue that whatever they like is what should be discussed and everything else isn't really part of the Nasuverse and should be ignored.  <br>Nah, more like, those kind of people should just watch/read/play Y anyway and see if they enjoy it.</br>  <br>"Murder is wrong" and "If you're going to kill her, I'd rather do it myself." There is more, but that's the gist of it.</br>  If 30% arc is worth 4 servants of stats, then why couldn't 15 servants match 100 Arc?  What do tomboys tomboys tomboys tomboys tomboys?  <br>It's fucking poetry, man.</br>  <br>Is Medaka Box a manga or an LN?</br>  Are there any shows upcoming or airing with tomboys?  <br>Both.</br>  <br>Sauce? Google just tells me nagisa manoa but that isn't any series</br>  Britain is love.<br>Britain is life.<br>Cecilia a best.<br>All other Stratos can go home.</br></br></br>  <br> what about Charl taking Ichika DNA sample to clone </br>  Anyone still has the pic what if Ichika was a girl?  <br>This one?</br>    <br>Thanks<br><br> This one? <br>No, but thanks anyway</br></br></br></br>  I'm trying to watch the Psycho pass movie with te anon subs but....<br><br>THE FUCKING ENGRISH<br><br>SO GODAMN DISTRACTING<br><br>I tried reading the subs outloud to distract myself but it's just too fucking awful. Why did they even bother forcing the obviously monolingual japanese voice actors to speak english? Why not Japanese and pretend its another language? American movies do it all the time. It's obviooiusly inferior to having foreign characters speaking the actual language, but definitely is better than whatever the fuck this shit is. It's unlistenable it's so distractingly bad.<br><br>It's *kind of* close to the subs but is still incomprehensible, but still vaguely sounds like english. So I'll stop reading the subs for a moment because "oh its similar", but then a second later i realize again that its totally retarded shit and then miss details on what's happening.<br><br>WHY DO THEY DO THIS?!!??!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Movie was fun and entertaining. I would like them to continue until they resolve Akane and Kogami's character arcs.</br>  <br><br>I guess the seaun military guys getting slaughtered by drones qualified, but I meant more gore and violence in terms of plot. People died in disgusting ways but it wasn't really as disturbing as some of the murders in season 1 or the torture in season 2.<br><br><br><br>I love her bitchy attitude. She would definitely fight back and make it more exciting.<br><br><br><br>I don't know what they would do in s3. Akane won't join sibyl but she won't resist it or argue that it should end itself. Although it didn't feel conclusive, saying that sibyl would keep evolving at the end of the movie pretty much summarizes what will keep happening. Sibyl takes over humanity while akane keeps it in balance. Nothing could possibly happen that would make her resist sibyl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> and now she rivals her in terms of intuition and also serves as a foil. <br>No she doesn't. Mika didn't deduce shit, Sibyl told her everything from the start.</br></br>  How would you give the show a conclusive and good ending? Apart from having kogami and akane doing the do at last.  <br>Sybil is introduced to more countries.</br>  Which Symphogear the sexiest, /a/?  <br>Hibiki by far</br>  <br><br>I prefer calling them experienced goods.</br></br>  <br> the project was abolished and they were freed <br>Didn't FIS break away with from government and kidnap the girls?</br></br>  <br>Hibiki for one</br>  <br>What's the name of the guy who does these? That signature is illegible and I can't find those images on pixiv nor with a google search. Does he post them on twitter?</br>  Trench Flowers #6 + anything /ak/  The goggles. They do nothing.  <br>Too bad the artstyle is so ugly that there is no erotic behind such scenes.</br>  <br>You're either slowpoke or obsessed.<br><br>OK, let's get this out of the way.<br><br>Character saying something = what the character thinks, it's canon (s)he thinks that way. So the Rabits think the Panzer IV is a boy.<br>Author saying something = what the author thinks, it's canon it IS that way. So Actas has made canon the Panzer IV is a girl.<br>Deal with it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> make a short one liner because the website stopped loading in the middle of the page for some time <br> suddenly that one guy gets butthurt <br><br>Is that the autism of /u/?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, and before you say "t-tha's not canon". Nope, those cards have teh same canonicity as the BD booklets (that is: 100%) and also gave us the canon names of severla girls, too.<br><br>Newfags today.</br></br></br></blockquote>]
