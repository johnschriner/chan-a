[  Main role in THREE shows this season <br> had never even been in a show until shirobako <br><br> MC of an anime about new seiyuu's <br><br>Her voice is pretty nice too. She's going to be a houeshold voice soon.</br></br></br></br></br>  One Page Thread  i just found out that you can solve the captcha using the numpad. holy shit this is convenient    <br>source?</br>  <br>Okitenemuru</br>  <br> Okitenemuru <br>Looks meh but thanks.</br></br>  <br>tbh</br>    This manga sure gets good after a while. <br><br>Shame the anime took two separate seasons and two OAD to finally do it justice... in the very last fucking episode of the last OAD.</br></br>     oh hey Fortuna doesn't seem like all that much of a bad guy <br> this happens <br>okay.png</br></br>  Anime when.    It's Alive! It might finish scanlating in our lifetime now    <br>This makes my dick diamonds.</br>          At what point can I safely drop medaka and not miss anything interesting? I would read the whole thing for completeness sake but damn it's long.       You will never hide inside of a couch       <br> 21 volumes <br> Damn it's long <br>Look at him, Look at him and laugh</br></br></br>  <br>Source? I googled it but didnt find anything.</br>  <br>Time passes slowly when you're bored.</br>  <br>Just leave before your normal rubs off on anyone else.</br>    <br>I'm really sorry you have shit taste.</br>  <br>Rokudenashi Blues by Morita Masanori a staple Delinquent manga<br><br>If you like it you should read Rookies by the same mangaka</br></br></br>  God damnit.<br><br>This, Haru No Houtai Shoujo and Coloumb Fille were among my favorite running manga. <br><br>Coulomb vol.3 sucked, Haru is finished and this is never getting an update. Now I barely have anything to look forward to, beside stuff like Horimiya which is starting to stagnate.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Awesome. Thanks. Definitely going to check it out.</br>    <br>Then pick up some new manga? It's not exactly rocket science.</br>    <br>Sorry I just felt like ranting. <br><br>I have picked up a lot of new manga. I suppose I have an itch for shit like pic in previous post or this pic. <br><br>Either way, sorry just me bitching.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not like mangaka just release one series and then disappear off the face of the planet, Inio is doing Dead Dead Demon's Dededededestruction now and it's a better manga than Punpun was.</br>  <br>It's alive? You shitting me, FOR REAL? HOLY SHIT!!! Nah but seriously how, when, by whom, MU doesn't list any new chapters out.</br>    <br>It's the mood of the manga. Both Punpun and IB has the same kind of depressing mood and they pull it off well albeit in different ways.<br><br>Thanks though. I admit to not having read the rest of Inio's work, which is weird now that I think about it. I really loved punpun.</br></br></br>  What's that manga about a girl that's trapped in a dream? And she walks through doors I think, and gets to different places but can't seem to get out?<br>I remember seeing it in one of these threads.</br>  <br>Don't worry he lived.</br>  <br>Agreed, I'm tired of people who complain that it's not just Punpun 2</br>  <br>Just play the game.</br>  <br>it's on batoto by the same crazy delinquents and shit scans or whatever the old group was.</br>    <br>Wasn't that a videogame?</br>  <br><br>I'm not sure? I remember it was a manga.</br></br>  <br>Oh wow. Thanks.<br>Is the game better?</br></br>  <br>Awesome, hope they keep at it for at least 100 more chapters. RokuBlues might not be the best delinquent manga but shit its still really good.</br>  <br>Sauce?</br>    <br><br><br><br>Just read it and fuck its painful how quick that chapter was and I had forgotten it was so good, even if the scan quality is meh. Also, shit son whoever that Onizuka guy is I know he's pretty important just because he's in a bunch of colored promotional art work, can't fucking wait now, This made my day.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The scanlator says he likes the arc so hopefully we'll at least get this 1 arcs worth of chapters<br><br><br>Thank you, this is some good shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Huh, you'd think it's a popular enough series to find plenty of results in google, but there's none. <br><br>It's Yozakura Quartet.<br><br>Also I'm still upset they didn't bother animating this flashback.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Try Mahou Tsukai no Yome, or Magi no Okurimono (same author as CF).<br><br>Or try Kanojo wa Rokurubi.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks based anon. I'll give all of them a look.</br>    <br>21 volumes? Long?<br><br>Where do you think you are?</br></br></br>  <br>oh god</br>  New scans   never ever        <br>I am a patient boy. I wait, I wait, I wait  ;_; </br>  <br>Sauce?</br>  <br>Nvm, its Instant Bullet right?</br>  <br>We must be strong, anon.</br>  <br>It's by the artist of Alien 9. I heard it didn't do the game justice.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>      <br><br>21 volumes is way more than I'd be willing to read for something I didn't like.</br></br>  <br>Why would you be reading it at all if you don't like it?</br>  <br>If I'd gotten into it and then gotten tired of it before it ended.</br>  <br> Okitenemuru <br><br>Oh I remember when that came out</br></br></br>  <br>I've run into this issue. I really liked Punpun and mostly enjoyed all chapters about him. But a good half of the manga wasn't about punpun and was instead about other characters I didn't care for.<br><br>I only cared about Punpun, yet I had to trudge through all these boring side characters.<br><br>Manga with a large volume count usually are subject to this kind of treatment, so they are undesirable or not worth it to read when all you want is to focus on the main characters. Its either that or just shitty fillers that mean nothing.</br></br></br></br></br>    I tried on panda thread, but no luck.<br>Can anyone tell me the name of this manga.<br><br>It's not really a hentai. It's about a high school girl in a post-war setting. She then met 2 guys who let her stayed in their place.<br>One of the guys make a living by using his saliva to make sake and he often eat pickled rock or something.<br>Oh, and the girl fucked those guy sometimes.</br></br></br></br></br>        <br>Anjuu no Chi?</br>  <br>It comes out too slowly</br>    I'm halfway through Kokou no Hito. Is it supposed to be a clusterfuck or am I just too dumb to understand what the fuck is going on?    <br>That's it!<br>I love you, anon.</br></br>  <br>is she wearing Air Force One's?</br>  <br>Is this the same artist as comic studio? Reminds me of his art.</br>  <br>Yes, it is.</br>        <br><br><br>This is great.</br></br></br>  <br>So does almost everything else I read.</br>  <br><br> tripfag <br> good taste <br><br>I'm conflicted</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tripfag </br>  <br>Don't try to act like you're any different.</br>  <br><br> ice powers <br> literally ""freeze"" time <br><br>Not this shit again</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you're </br>  <br>more than dumb just thick headed but it does throw alot at you</br>  What the hell did I read?  <br> absolute zero <br> http://physics.about.com/od/glossa<wbr>ry/g/absolutezero.htm</wbr> <br><br> Some substances, when cooled to near-absolute zero temperatures, reach a state of matter known as a superfluid, which exhibit strange properties. <br><br> Scientists have achieved temperatures extremely close to absolute zero, where matter exhibits quantum effects such as superconductivity and superfluidity. <br><br>Its possible.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> BOOB'S </br>  <br>That's a comma after END not an apostrophe</br>  <br> IN THE END, BOOBS-- <br>please don't be fucking retarded, i beg.</br></br>   tfw you find a nice long manga you've never heard of to get immersed in   <br>no it's not<br><br>you can't freeze something that doesn't exist</br></br></br>    <br>You are right in saying you can't freeze time.

Comfiest thing I've read in a while.<br>Couldn't find the page I wanted to though. Shame.</br>  <br>I really wanted to like this manga, but it was so boring.</br>    <br>He wasn't responsible for the story though.</br>  <br> not liking Pegasus <br>But I love that side of you too, anon.</br></br>  <br>An excellent exercise in world building.</br>    <br>Huh, I recently finished Gantz.<br>What the fuck was up with the ridiculously bad CGI shit near the end? I mean sure I know they use a shitton of CGI stuff for the manga but god damn it that was fucking horrible.</br></br>    <br>What a terrible ending.  KnJ actually did it right. </br>    <br> Koe no Katachi True End.jpg </br>    <br>for being a manga about asses<br>they are pretty terrible at drawing them</br></br>  <br>and then she grew up to be a bloody homo</br>  <br>huh there was an epilogue  but why? </br>  <br> <br> girl tells guy to wait <br> guy decides to wait <br> 10-some year time skip to after graduation <br> she kisses him and tells him thats the most she can do for now <br> the end </br></br></br></br></br> <br>Pretty standard epilogue for this type of manga</br></br>  <br>light =/= time</br>  <br>Based Muscle Rider.</br>  <br><br>how is 21 volumes not long? <br><br>Berserk is one of the longest manga ever and it's only around 30 volume iirc tbh</br></br></br></br>  This part was unexpected. Too bad the series is moving waaaaaaaay to fast now.    <br><br>I just marathoned this and it's a wild ride, almost as stupid as AgK but more enjoyable. MC is a flaming dumbass and being Shiki is suffering.</br></br>    <br>new chapter out</br>  <br>Why is Ant-Man chasing her with a knife</br>  <br>I just finished it as well. I was completely shocked at how good it was. Probably the best manga I have ever read.</br>  <br>I just marathoned this, it's really good. it's different too.</br>  <br>Still waiting for somebody to finish Boys on the Run</br>  <br>tongue doesn't look big enough</br>      <br>sauce?</br>  <br>What the hell is this? Google wont tell me shit.</br>  Sumire is the purest waifu possible  <br>but she's a puppet!</br>  <br>a puppet is fine too</br>  <br>ARM is a pretty decent MMA manga, but you could have at least tried to find a more interesting page.<br> Not that I can think of any offhand, the art is just stupendously average. </br></br>  <br>Google gives nothing, Tineye same, iqdb likewise.<br>Cold war in 1958 and Red Zeppelin part 2 both bring up actual articles. Please advise on sauce.</br></br>  <br> light = time <br><br>look at this fucking idiot<br><br>also they slowed down light. you can't freeze something that isn't matter <br><br>Time isn't matter. therefore even if it did exist in the way idiots think it does, you still couldn't freeze it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not even 200 hundred chapters long. For shame, even if you're a summerfag, at least have some understanding of where the fuck you are.</br>  <br>why did she ruin a perfectly good phone like that?</br>  <br>http://mangafox.me/manga/the_sea_of<wbr>_fallen_beasts/<br>I got your ass nigga.<br><br>First chappter</br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br><br><br>You know, posting one-shot hentai manga isn't really what OPT's are about.</br></br></br>    best butt  <br>Oh, you know. Gotta cut all ties and shit.<br> Even though she literally comes back in the same chapter </br></br>  <br>Yet again, no results on Google, Tineye and IQDB.<br>Please provide sauce.</br></br>    <br>What the hell, you didn't even thank me.</br>  <br>I only now decided to just scroll down and ignore the rest. I've already got about 5-6 possibles.<br> Thanks, anon. </br></br>  <br>Just keep reading, it all comes together.</br>    <br>You slime it is by the EDEN guy complaining is forbidden.</br>      <br>Sauce?</br>  <br>Was it the MC who deflowered her or was she used goods after being assaulted and having her leg and eye removed?</br>  <br>New manga.</br>  <br><br>Spirit Circle</br></br>  <br>Is it called New or are you asking me to check for new mangas so I can find it?</br>  <br>I bet he didn't even knew string theory</br>  <br>can't find source. send help</br>  <br>new chapters never.</br>      <br>Hello Hank, I'd like to talk to you about how to make traditional Japanese, high quality charcoal.</br>  Don't ask me for source, I don't know it.<br>Ask /a/.</br>  <br>Maou na Ore to Fushihime no Yubiwa.<br>try a bit harder next time.</br></br>  I hope the releases become more consistent with this; shit gets real in the next few chapters.            I'm looking for a fantasy gag manga.<br><br>It had a bunch of people being the hero's descendant, they're entrusted with a bodyguard, and the MC's bodyguard is an asshole. They start travelling with the pink haired, loli demon lord.<br><br>It had a talking lolicon cat.<br><br>Please help, /a/</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> shinji </br>  <br>you can't just post cute monstergirls and not source</br>  <br> Pixiv file name <br>Are you new?</br></br>    <br>senkyuu</br>  <br>Oh, good lord. Thank you.<br><br>I will refrain from making the pun.</br></br></br>  <br>Scanlations basically died though</br>  <br>source? google is acting funny for me</br>  <br>Sauce please Google doesn't give me anything.</br>    <br>You didn't even try to google. Fuck off.</br>  <br>Maou na Ore to Fushihime no Yubiwa</br>  <br>It's porn you can probably find it on sadpanda by searching fox and loli.</br>    <br>I'm asking because a chink forum with broken pictures doesn't really give me anything to go off of.</br>  <br>Not cool, anon.</br>  <br>Rest in fucking peace</br>  <br>Yeah but unfortunately very little bar the SoL stuff happens in one page. I can't think of many fight pages that would give a full picture of what's actually going on. Besides, I don't have my pages saved in my mango pages folder.</br>  <br>Kanojo wa Rokurokubi<br><br>Step up senpai, it took me three minutes to find. Google-&gt;japanese raw-&gt;Google the other pages until-&gt;title</br></br></br>      <br>I swear I'm googling this but nothing is coming up, even the "Asagi Days" in the page doesn't turn up any results</br>    <br>Try Yandex.</br>  <br>I have never read any of Tezuka's works. What's a good starting point? Also: How are his sexual works?</br>  <br> I have never read any of Tezuka's works. What's a good starting point?  <br>Anything, he has too much shit, look for stuff you like instead, I mean genres and the type of stories you like and he probably has something that fits what you want.</br></br>  <br> Also: How are his sexual works? </br>  <br>Any bush?</br>  <br>Wow it worked thanks</br>  <br>What is it? I've tried both google, yandex, and archive. Got nothing.</br>    Why didn't they just build their city underground with low ceilings  <br><br>That's actually a good idea.<br><br>And, they could have built a system of tunnels to get beyond the walls.</br></br></br></br>  They tried. It ended up turning into a slum.  <br>that would be admitting defeat you might as well be dead</br>  <br>you mean like the inner districts after the fall of Wall Maria and Shiganshina district?</br>  <br>can't grow crops with no sun</br>  <br>true, didn't think of that</br>  <br>Really now? And uh, how could you commence an operation of digging giant tunnels, structuring them with beams, organizing all that shit, while titans are trying to kill you?<br><br>Not to mention that have medieval technology, what are they gonna do, shovel the tunnels?<br><br>And not only that, but Titans sense where people are. You think they aren't going to try busting through the floor?<br><br>Retard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some guy tried digging down and hit some strange hard rock that kept him from digging deeper<br>The government made him disappear after he mentioned it, presumably because the floor is made of titans just like the walls.<br>You'd know this if you read the intermission cards</br></br></br>  <br>The Government didn't want people to go beyond the walls. <br><br>Plus they killed a miner who tried to dig beneath the walls. No way would they allow an entire tunnel system beneath them.</br></br></br>  Why didn't they just build their civilization on an island.  <br>truly, every thing IS titans. Those trees? Titans! That water? Titans! You think that's air you're breathing?<br>TITANS</br></br>  <br>I imagine the same way they commenced an operation of planting foundations, structuring them with beams, organizing all that shit, and building a fifty metre stone wall while titans were trying to kill them.</br>  <br>didnt they use the device that controls titans and had them build the wall?</br>  <br> device <br>Its a chemical that turns you into a titan. They all got together and used the hardening ability</br></br>  <br>He's talking about the coordinate</br>  <br>Yeah its a manufactured chemical weapon</br>  <br> Why didn't they just build their civilization on an island. <br><br>Because saboteur titans like Annie would show up to put an end to that.</br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't they just build bigger walls?</br>  <br>The walls are big enough.</br>  <br>watch the levi ovas</br>  <br>Reminder that chapter 71 confirmed YH and EM. Eren is a Grisha Reiss so he's related to hisotira.<br><br>EH=btfo.</br></br></br>  <br>They have/had WW2 Tech, They could've built the tunnels pre fall of any of walls bud.<br><br>Mushrooms grow without light, Titans also didn't fuck up plants, They could've fielded a bunch of crops and basically do mad dashes to harvest them if there was any threat of titans.</br></br></br>  Do the impossible<br>See the Invisible<br>Row Row Attack the Titan!</br></br>  <br>Mushrooms will grow just fine.</br>  <br>The titans would step on them and kill everyone. No one wants to live in the mines of Moria anyway.</br>  <br>Why, so you can live like livestock forever?</br>  Does anyone know why the dub pronounces "Maria" so weird?  These two decide to tag together. Is there any pair that can beat them?  <br>Yami/Kaiba or Yusei/Jack if they get access to the new summoning methods and appropriate support</br>  <br>Make them fight Ruri and Leo, then sit back and enjoy the tears.</br>  <br>Yusei&amp;Jack<br>Leo&amp;Yusho<br>Yuya&amp;Yuzu</br></br></br>  <br>Neo Sawatari &amp; Neo New Sawatari</br>  <br>Yusei/Jack would probably already have enough stuff in their decks to beat them, if everything (including Quasar) is allowed.</br>  YUGIOH SUCKS DICK<br><br>CARDFIGHT VANGUARD FOREVER</br></br>  <br>Somebody get this hothead outta here!</br>  <br>I dont even know what that is lmao</br>  <br>is that a new meme?</br>     tfw can't shout summons together with the characters because flatmates     <br>Of course he will use scar-right, how else will he entertain his audience without WAGA TAMASHII and ABSOLUTE POWER FORCE</br>  <br>If you guys wants to do some fun with friends you should try duels with these rules:<br><br> Use a Random number generator between 1 and 107 and roll 6 random numbers. <br><br> search for Yugioh number cars having these numbers and add 3 of each to your extra deck. (reroll the numbers that don't exist) <br><br> make a deck based on these. <br><br> You have to summon one of each through the duel before winning or else you can't reduce your opponent's life point to 0. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh and I forgot:<br> numbers can only be destroyed by other numbers. </br></br>  SUDDENLY  Isn't this cute she finally sees her tomato again. Too bad isn't gonna get short lived.  <br>Are those tears in her eyes? Also Yugo looks unimpressed</br>  <br>Dude's thinking in his mind terms of: "Yep, he doesn't stand a chance better not tell her that."</br>  <br>Yeah she's shedding tears that Yuya okay and Yugo's impression's likely: "So I guy that looks just like me facing my all time hero, let's see how this plays out."</br>  <br>I want to lick Yuzu's tears.</br>  Is Yugo's Clear Wing the only one who can stand up to Jacks Scar-right?    <br>Haha Yugo is mad because Yuya fights Jack and he's been waiting 14 years to do it himself</br>  <br>Nah it will probably be a new Pendulum Synchro Yuya will develop after his duel with Yugo</br>  <br> Opp is not bennis <br><br><br>Those guys</br></br></br></br>  Literally JoJo Pt.3 Stardust Crusaders reference.  <br>Or the DRAGONS are at it again.</br>  <br>If Yugo can be in the stands without being ported away it a Yuya/Yugo duel seems possible in the Friendship Cup.</br>  <br>Yuzu won't be around to teleport them to begin with.</br>  <br>What? You're gonna have to spell this one out for me.</br>  <br>HOLY SWEET JESUS! Why would you do that?</br>  <br>So it took 22 episodes for them to see each other again, by far they beat the yugioh record</br>  <br>Why is Marik so fucking hot? <br>Shit's no fair.</br></br>  <br>What monster is in the chrome blue?</br>  <br> Security takes Yuzu away for absolutely no reason, making Bracelet-kun useless <br><br>The writers are gettiing smarter by the day</br></br></br>  <br>The Psychic or Ohajikid?</br>  <br>Probably a new Warrior monster</br>  <br>Are the rest of the bracelets useless? They must have different functions, since Rin's bracelet didn't do anything when Yuri and Yugo were in the same place.</br>  <br>There was a time I tried by pure autism to name each part of YGO series like "JJBA" parts.<br><br>DM - Phantom Blood/Pharaoh Blood<br>GX - Battle Tendency/Duel Tendency<br>5D's - Stardust Crusaders/Stardust Riders<br><br>but High-Speed Riders sounds better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like a Psychic-type monster</br>  <br> Cover card  <br>Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Belial <br>Hi-Speedroid Chanbarider <br>Speedroid Ohajikid <br>Unknown Monster</br></br></br></br></br>   DOCS coming to the TCG in November <br><br>Damn the dub hasn't even started yet and Clash of Rebellion is out next month</br></br>  <br>I will eat my hat if Security actually arrests Yuzu. That's kind of silly after going to the trouble of giving her a riding suit and everything.</br>  <br>It's so she'll look good in chains.</br>  <br>This is probably the only way that I can see Yuya and Yugo going DRAGON on each other</br>  <br>If they can be in the stands watching Yuya vs Jack, it's apparently far enough away that Yuya vs Yugo will work too.</br>  <br>Their release schedule is so fucked up with Arc-V.</br>  <br>Let's be honest, since Arc-V's first episode and the threads in 4chan, Yu-Gi-Oh! got fucked up... in a very good way.</br>  <br> Rin's bracelet didn't do anything when Yuri and Yugo were in the same place. <br>I forgot that this confirmed that the bracelets don't have the same function. I'm looking forward to the MISUNDERSTANDINGS that Serena's bracelet will cause.</br></br>  <br>I don't think so.</br>  <br>He does look pretty jealous. Like he's eyeing Yuya as a rival.<br><br>Come to think of it, Yugo doesn't seem to have a Kaiba to be his rival. Yuri doesn't either, and he was also pretty touchy about other versions of him existing.</br></br></br>  <br>Did Yuto have a rival??</br>    <br>Damn you</br>  <br><br>Oh shit I'm sorry, wrong pic. No wonder you two replied like that.</br></br>  <br>Delete this</br>  <br>Reported, enjoy your ban.</br>  <br>I'm triggered</br>  <br>Why is her belly button showing through her shirt?</br>  Why is this series so much more sexual than past series?  <br>It's pretty thin material. I even had to shopped the tits since it's too lewd.</br>  Which is the best?<br><br> This is a shit taste detector, so you better watch yourself. </br></br>  <br>47 or 50<br> YUZU ;_; </br></br>  <br>You are a complete faggot if you don't pick 38 or 50</br>  <br>29</br>  Oh, man, how slow am I to not notice til now that Scarred Right Red Dragon Archefiend's arm is the same arm it used to try and fend off Junk Warriors final Scrap Fist attack at the end of 5D's ?

Wake me up   <br>Yeah, I feel like it was the same kind of scenario as Radio, except she didn't make it. <br><br>Although, didn't they have medicine and everything else to protect against all of that?<br><br><br>You're right, but in the end, we might not know until twenty chapters or more are released. I just feel like it was because she was supposed to be marked as different from the rest of them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The SoL bait lasted way too much. It was good anyway, but the characters look wierd.<br>I wonder if they'll change the OP</br>  Replying for shovel.    Rii-chan, Miki, Kurumi... even Taroumaru! They're all okay! <br><br>Everything's gonna be daijobu!</br></br>  How dead is she?  <br> ;~; </br>  Had no idea what I was getting into with this, just thought it was SoL comfy stuff. Jesus I've never WUT'd so hard as I did at the end of the episode.  <br>Currently only half dead.</br>  I remember there was a chapter that showed Megu when she first became zombiefied and blamed herself but I can't remember why she was alone in a dangerous area in the first place.  <br>Half.</br>  <br>100% confirmed to be alive. Just look at the ending.</br>  <br>Dead enough.</br>  That smile. Made me fall in love all over again.  <br>Right as she started turning she remembered the safe house and tried to get there. But didn't make it.</br>  <br><br>How much longer does she have? Will she make it until the end?</br></br>  why is yuki's subconscious so useful  <br><br>Japanese raws where? I don't want Korean shit.</br></br>  ONE FUCKING JOB.<br><br>FUCKING<br><br>JOB</br></br></br></br>  <br>No where, they haven't been uploaded online yet.</br>  <br>I hope they keep the OP almost exactly how it is, but slowly add more "grusome" stuff i the background</br>  <br>Unclear, but she's dead enough that zombies don't notice her unless she tries to get their attention.</br>  <br>Yeah that's in the same chapter but is it ever said why she went into zombie territory and got bit in the first place.</br>  <br>Best girl</br>  <br><br>And yet Korean ones have. This is totally bullshit, I wish I could buy an ebook of the magazine or something.</br></br>  Healing.  <br> Akarin is invincible because the zombies don't even realize that she's there  <br>The savior of humanity right here.</br></br>  <br>why? shovel chiyo is good enough</br>  <br><br>I thought they didn't notice her because it was night.</br></br>  <br> bait <br>It's a SoL series. Get used to it.</br></br>  <br>Highly unlikely and the time left is completely unknown. This waiting for her to die is the biggest suffering possible.<br><br><br>They never said, but in the scene where she got bitten there were a shit ton of zombies.<br>So im guessing the zombies broke through the barricade.<br><br><br>Its extremely bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   they had to kill the fuking dog?  <br><br>seriously?!</br></br>  <br>They're all dead  on the inside. </br>   anime was good. <br><br> translations will continue once i obtain scans, survive comiket, and get back from japan on the 18th next month. <br><br> apologies for the delay. <br><br>Only two more months people, hang in there.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The dog was doomed from the beginning. <br><br><br>You're definitely not wrong, anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But Kurumi isn't an Ayayayaya. She's a het girl who wanted a boy and even though she's manly as fuck and would be a great husbando for any of the girls, she still wants to be a cute bride. <br><br><br>Shovel Chiyo a best.</br></br></br></br>  This show achieves everything that SoRaNoWoTo failed to-- enjoy it faggots, here's the actual SOL with a real backstory and not just bullshit pretending to go somewhere.<br><br>This is about as good as slice of life gets.</br></br>  <br> dog <br>He will forever be nothing but a useless side character.<br>I refuse to accept him.</br></br></br>  <br> But Kurumi isn't an Ayayayaya. She's a het girl who wanted a boy and even though she's manly as fuck and would be a great husbando for any of the girls, she still wants to be a cute bride. <br>This changes nothing.</br></br>    <br>It changes EVERYTHING.</br>  <br>CHANGES. NOTHING.<br><br>show could have been great, now it will never surpass mediocrity.</br></br></br>  So wait, is the dog real or not?<br>Was "the dog is on the loose" just an excuse her friends used to get ptsd-chan to run for her life?</br>  <br>The dogs real, he's just going to be emotional bait.</br>  <br>Dog seems real. There's nothing to run for their lives from on that floor of the school.</br>  Who makes the best faces?  <br>Nah, now it'll be a masterpiece. Take your Ayayayayaya and get outta here.</br>  Is the manga still being translated<br><br>shit seems slow or stalled</br></br>  <br>Rii when she breaks for sure.</br>  <br>I sound like a fucking idiot, but did the chalkboard really say that? How did I miss that? Fuck, man.</br>  <br> https://rkeg.wordpress.com/2015/07<wbr>/09/re-gakkou-gurashi/</wbr> </br>  <br>Cray or Shovel definitely.</br>  <br>it's okay anon, you were probably just enjoying the SoL antics</br>  <br>thanks maangyne</br>  Worst fanbase on /a/ already  <br><br><br>They all make good faces when they're freaking out.</br></br></br>  Tomodachi deshou~  Damn, I like the premise of this show, but I can already tell it's one I'm not going to be able to watch with /a/ because of spoils from mangafags.<br>Oh well, see you guys next season~</br>  <br>Her head covers that half of the chalkboard until the very last moment. When she moves and reveals that line, the shot immediately changes.<br><br>It's foreshadowing on the level of an american horror flick.</br></br></br>  <br>The dog was real before Mii-kun was real.</br>  <br>Why didn't Kurumi share the medicine with radio-chan?<br>Did nobody ever tell her what happened to her?</br></br>  <br>Why don't you just read the manga and stop being a secondary then?</br>   Thinking everything about the school seems suspicious as fug while watching the first episode <br> That reveal at the end <br>I don't really like Moe, but t may have been worth it for that reveal at the end.</br></br>  <br>Yeah it's not really that important anyway. I could imagine it never getting mentioned too, especially if it's something inconsequential like a seasonal change or a different department.</br>  <br>Radio had already fully turned. It's a suppressant not a cure.</br>  Every time I watch a Zombie show, this idea crosses my mind.<br><br>It would be so much easier to just kill yourself and be done with it, instead of living in horror everyday in fear of being eaten alive.<br>All resistance is futile when you're outnumbered 10000 to 1.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah this. i watched the episode and right after read the manga. it doesn't take long and it's worth it</br>     this will be done in Chino's voice   <br>Because then I'll know what happens in the anime before getting to see it. That doesn't seem ideal</br>  <br>I like how the microscope was used to bash someone's head in.</br>  what is the point of her hat? is it some coping device or is it meaningless?  Just like Highschool of the dead there's only one way this story can end. Death, the sweet release of death as the world goes to shit Just like Dead Rising, just like Resident Evil, just like Left for Dead, just like The Last of us. There's no such zombie story where suddenly the zombies are defeated and humanity rebuilds to what it once was.  <br>The anime will never be able to do the suffering as good as the manga anon, trust me.</br>  <br> he doesn't like hats </br>  <br>Well I know who I don't want in my SoL apocalypse survivor group.</br>  <br>There's that word again.<br>Can we not start this shit please?</br></br>  <br><br>I never really get why people complain about spoilers. Why can't people just enjoy the ride? A good story is entertaining even if you go through it two or three times.</br></br>  <br>How can they be so carefree when straggler zombies occasionally get through the barricade?</br>  <br>Yeah, it'd be depressing as fug to live in a zombie world. <br><br>I mean, sure, you could live, but you'd be looking over your back for the rest of your life.<br><br><br>I'm assuming that the cast will slowly dwindle as more and more characters die to zombies or crap, probably with a death directly caused by one of them as a zombie.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Individual zombies aren't hard to deal with. Just bash their heads in with a baseball bat.</br></br>  What would you do?  <br>It's still better if you don't know what's coming. I still like to rewatch stuff, a lot actually, but being surprised, in real time, by the work itself is undeniably better than hearing about it from someone else before actually seeing it.</br>  <br>let her bite me so we could live happily ever after together</br>  <br>Everything's easier if you kill yourself, anon. The struggle is what makes things worthwhile. <br><br>It's pretty difficult to live in a zombie apocalypse, and you have a good chance to die every day, but I'd rather die fighting zombies than just giving up and never even attempt survival.</br></br></br>  <br>Cure her, make her fall for me then marry her.</br>  <br>They don't occasionally get through. That happens right after a fire and a lot of their barriers were down.</br>  <br>Why don't you just stop trying to act like you feel superior and force other peple to read the manga? You're only ruining the threads with your idiotic attitude faggot.</br>  <br>There is a pink haired girl with brain damage running all around on the floors, and you are expected to follow her whims around. She even goes to the toilet at night. It's not a matter of difficulty of dealing with a single one.</br>  <br>So do they have some kind of endgame? Leaving the school? Finding other survivors? Or is this one of those things where somehow there are no other survivors?</br>  <br>Do you go to the toilet at night, anon?</br>  <br>Blame chink and gook scanlators for being stingy little shits and not making their raws public.</br>  <br>They do leave the school like one or two chapters after this </br>  <br>She will give you zombie STD.</br>  <br>But this is not what Sora no Woto tried.</br>  <br>It's a simple case of risk and return.<br>It's just not worth it when there is no light at the end of the tunnel.</br></br>  <br>Maybe it's different for everyone.  I typically get immersed into something to the point where I just forget everything else the first time through. </br>  <br>this sounds a little bit too familiar</br>  <br><br>Tell her that the toilets are going through indefinite maintenance and have her piss in a bucket. As for bashing the zombies in, tell her that's a new trendy way to greet people.</br></br>  <br> I'm assuming that the cast will slowly dwindle as more and more characters die to zombies or crap, probably with a death directly caused by one of them as a zombie. <br><br>Obviously. No way in hell will the author actually let them survive this. Nobody survives in zombie shows or movies. Even when they fool you into thinking they could, BAM, suddenly the save house they reached is gone because some dick head hid the fact they were bitten or the stupid corporation decided to keep making their zombie juice OR, and this is my personal favorite, a crazy fucker unleashes an experimental zombie in the safe house because "Fuck the world, fuck surviving, let's all meet again in the next life!". There was even a zombie movie that had it's group escape to the Flordia Keys and low and behold, there are zombies there too and they all die.</br></br></br>   All these people who haven't read the manga <br>Seriously? I finished it in a few hours, its not long.</br>  <br>Is the brain damage a permanent thing?</br>  <br> brain damage <br>Its all an act, she knows full well whats going on.<br><br><br>And you think you're any better than him by posting this? replying is going to cause as much shitposting as he is.<br><br><br>It'll all be worth it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is the light at the end of the regular life tunnel?<br><br>I'm seriously asking, I just don't know.</br></br></br>  <br>No. She's only pretending to be retarded.</br>  <br>It's okay, she needs no explanation of what's going on.</br>  <br>You're ruining them by crying about how people are discussing the series in a thread about it. Fuck off. He obviously is superior since he actually follows the material instead of just coming to 4chan to blindly shitpost like you do.</br>  <br>Wasn't that Dawn of the dead or something?<br>I try not to waste time watching Zombie stuff, because it's all really similar. I mean, seriously.</br></br>  <br> pick up an anime <br> clear starting point <br> clear ending point <br> left satisfied and able to move on after the season ends <br><br> pick up a manga <br> read for 2 years <br> gets delayed for 1 year <br> author starts making chapters again for 3 more years <br> author delays for 2 years <br> picks back up for another 5 years <br> sales go down so author is forced to conclude the story <br> you actually died 4 years ago and never got to finish reading </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Its all an act, she knows full well whats going on. <br><br>Then why does she still go to the bathroom at night? That's so dangerous, she should at least do the favor of pissing in the bucket.</br></br></br>  <br>i'm pretty sure that's fire damage. What kind of idiot would use the lens area for bludgeoning instead of the base? Lenses are a bitch to replace</br>  <br>Because it's not really dangerous. Their barricades are strong and almost the whole school building is clear. Even if she does run into one she'd snap out of pretending to be retarded and deal with it like she did the one time it happens in the classroom.</br>  <br>Fuck her as she is turning</br>  <br><br>Not really. <br><br>The thing is that shows and movies and a lot of other zombie media don't really show you what actually happens to human bodies when left in the sun/cold for prolonged periods of time. Basically, their bodies would collapse within a few months tops. No matter what kind of cool stuff is helping their tissues out... sunlight is not good for your skin. Being out in the elements will destroy your body.<br><br>Shelter actually comes before water on the list of needs for survival. You will certainly die of the elements before you have time to dehydrate.<br><br>In short, the integrity of zombie bodies cannot hold. Even if we assume they can somehow move past death, just the stuff that a body is made of is going to severely degrade and collapse.<br><br>Plus, there's just too many people who actually do have zombie survival plans and supplies. While I didn't invest a lot of time into it, I do have them. Worst case, just chill.<br><br>Something missing from most zombie fiction is great and competent leaders. They do exist, please trust that I am one of them and would work to get things in order. Guys like Rick/etc have leadership thrust upon them and aren't really ready for the weight and haven't done prior planning.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> author delays for 2 years <br>This isn't HxH anon, it isn't going to happen.<br>Just read the manga.<br><br><br>Because she's still an idiot. And the school is barricaded so its not really too dangerous.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Will there be a full flashback of events when the school went down the shithole?  <br> deal with it like she did the one time it happens in the classroom. <br><br>But she's usually unarmed. That time she was lucky she had a broom.</br></br></br>  <br>Running from a single zombie isn't hard.</br>  <br>Feeling comfy with your life and smiling before dying.</br>  <br>They mentioned she was broken for days, but suddenly got up and she was got more genki than ever before. I just wonder how broken inside is she, that she can put this act up every day.</br>  <br>But your waifu accepted him. She even fed him with the taste of survival. Would you really utter such cold words to her if she had to mercy kill him in the anime?</br>  <br>Only one, and it shows why they survived.<br>And a little something else.</br></br>   DIE <br>SUKI~</br>  <br>Your theory doesn't work in Resident Evil universe  shittiest zombie franchise imo </br>  I think Gakkou Gurashi could make a good VN or adventure game. With all the possible ways to die/lose.<br><br> Having to escape/kill a zombie or be killed <br><br> Try to immediately approach the helicopter instead of proceeding cautiously, get literally blown the fuck out <br><br> That chapter where Miki must find the serum for the infection, if you take too long in getting the serum and coming back,   Yuuri will have killed Kurumi when you return <br><br>Stuff like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Yet The Walking Dead is a very popular show despite the fact that we all know how it ends. All of them dead or if the author wants to be an asshole, it ends on a scene with whoever huddled up and ready to tackle yet another horde of zombies coming for them with no denial or confirmation that the character or characters survive the confrontation with a scratch that will turn them soon or no wounds whatsoever so they can continue fighting in a world that's no longer there's.</br>  Good night guys taking a break from this suffering  <br>I also follow the source material.<br><br> And you think you're any better than him by posting this? <br>No, but people need a reminder to stop acting like idiots.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks anon, I think that's good enough for me.</br>  <br> The franchise where zombies can walk indefinitely without any form of nourishment <br> Their bodies barely even break down even in places it obviously would <br>I always hated that.</br></br></br>  <br>How did she not catch the zombie STD if zombie blood got in her eye?</br>  <br> All resistance is futile when you're outnumbered 10000 to 1. <br>Zombies are like lepers, they'll eventually fall apart from their everyday shamblings. Doubly so if they actually need humans for sustenance.<br>Time is on your side; stay alive in your foxhole and you'll get to repopulate the world someday.</br></br></br>  <br>Remember to lock the door.</br>  <br>Which is exactly why there's no point in watching it. Why waste your time watching something bleak, hopeless, and depressing, that isn't even entertaining on top of that?</br>  That first episode was so fucking disappointing. Holy shit, did they stretch that shit out. It would have been so much better if they got that shit over with by A part and spent B part on actual survival stuff. Everyone knew what this series is and yet Lerche fucking exaggerated the reveal. 3/10 about as mediocre as Hamatora.  I wonder if I would realize something was off before the end if I didn't know what it was about already. There are a lot of subtle hints. Even the mood is kind of off. But I'm not sure. Might have just dropped it.  <br>I don't care how much Shovel likes the dog, i can't stand the mongrel. He's only there to die anyway.<br><br><br>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Shovel arts, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids with the shovel squad on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills with the shovel. I am trained in shovel warfare and I’m the top shovel wielder in the entire US armed forces. <br><br><br><br>Washing it out? I don't know ask the author.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's the strongest of all.</br>  <br> Everyone knew what this series is <br>/a/nons are not everyone</br></br>  <br>It's been confirmed that zombification works on every mammal.</br>  <br><br>I genuinely looked up the series to see if it would stay this fucking boring or if I should finish the first episode.<br><br>Hope the second one's more exciting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that all of what has been done in the first episode is the authors fault</br>  <br> He's only there to die anyway. <br><br>Him and everyone who isn't named Yuki.</br></br></br>  <br>Like, where did it come from? How does it even work?<br><br>How did a disease spread by someone staggering around drunkenly and attacking actually manage to make it so far?</br></br></br>  <br> Washing it out? <br>That's not how it works. You can catch every disease by getting the patient's blood in your eyes that are not normally transmittable.</br></br>  <br>I mean it's the same problems with everything zombie related.</br>  <br>The very existence of zombies could deny your theory.<br>It's unnatural for a body to move after death. Where does it even draw its energy from when all its organs have shut down.<br>Expecting them to simply decompose because it's "common sense" is unreasonable.<br><br>You could make an argument about still 'living' zombies, such as in  The last of us , more so since the fungus does exist.<br>But in that case, when the host approaches its death it finds a good spot and spreads its spores, so waiting on them to die naturally is even more problematic.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't think too hard about it. This ride is about despair and slice of life.</br>  <br>They're not dead.<br>They're just... retarded.</br></br>  <br>If you did, you wouldn't be so upset about spoilers. Stop acting like an idiot.</br>  <br>Read up the summaries. The English and Japanese ones both end with something along the lines of "there's something more to this shit." The Japanese Wikipedia page straight up says there are zombies in its two page story outline.</br>  Not enough Kurumi/Taroumaru interaction this episode.  <br>The only thing about the virus known so far is that the government knew before hand and its man made.<br><br><br>Well, maybe it doesn't work that way.<br>Its a made up disease anyway who knows how it works.<br><br><br>Rude.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, okay, even with that. There are people who are good tactical leaders who want to live with all of their might and are not going to let odds that are hopeless, terrible, depressing-- whatever-- trample them.<br><br>While our present society keeps us out of constant threat and danger and shelters us from facing the threat of death on a daily basis, it hasn't always been the situation. We've made it through times that we couldn't even realize were horrible because they were the everyday.<br><br>Ultimately, great leaders cope with these problems. A zombie series that I think you guys should read is the Newsflesh trilogy. In my opinion, it shows a more realistic outcome of a zombie "apocalypse". However, in the worst case, even later on in the Walking Dead you will see competent leaders and what they can do.<br><br>We've been to the moon. We didn't die to nuclear war. This zombie thing could and would be dealt with and if it happened I'd give it my best. There's other people who would too. Sorry to be cheesy, but the "oh we're all doomed" attitude is something I want to remedy.<br><br>Love this show though. Great setup. Disagree with people who thought the SOL was too long, it was really needed to build setting, drop hints, and hit hard. Also dat fang.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Two sentence story outline I meant to say.</br>  <br>The problem with those scenarios is that people either have never seen a movie or have only seen the wrong ones and make really stupid decisions. Honestly in a walking biter-type zombie situation there would be a very large amount of survivor strongholds even if you assume stupidity allowed the zombies to spread. As  said the elements would destroy most of the infected within a month or two even assuming they could move and attack after a full "death" effect. It's the airborne disease and/or sprinter type like in Left 4 Dead or I Am Legend that would actually do severe damage.</br>  <br> 0 budget </br>  <br> Think about it <br> Ruined forever <br>Welp, guess I'll skip ahead and read the Manga.</br></br></br>  <br>You're one to talk. Don't bully Taroumaru. See<br/></br>  How do you people stand Yuki<br><br>she's so fucking autistic</br></br>  <br>Recent zombies make zombies fast ass fuckers but classical zombies are slow as shit and it makes you wonder why you would need to be afraid of a rotting, slow ass motherfucker.<br><br>Can you imagine a zombie trying to hike up a steep mountain with their missing muscles or limbs?<br><br>Zombies can't get /fit/ anymore which makes them easy tier horror monsters to kill.</br></br></br></br></br>  I really want to rehabilitate this woman... with my penis, if you catch my drift.<br><br>And then I'll marry her.</br></br>  <br>Are the kinmosas already zombies?</br>  <br>Because classic zombies swarm.</br>  <br> How do you people stand Yuki <br>The same way I tolerate you.</br></br>  <br>And Megu-nee is fucking retarded for not taking the proper measures.</br>  <br>Well sorry, i just don't want to get attached to a dog who i know is gonna be dead in about 3 or 4 episodes.<br><br><br>I'll take shovel then.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. The usagis too.</br>  <br>she's cute</br>  <br>Oh come on, at least pretend to care for her sake. Or would you actually pat her on the back after the deed and say something like <br> good job of getting rid of the stinky mutt, zombie waifu </br></br>  <br> &gt;I'll take shovel then. <br>Literally spoiled goods. Enjoy she-wesker while she lasts.</br></br>  <br>Then why get attached to another dead character like shovel?</br>  <br>It's pretty easy if you are not a faggot.</br>  How innocent and heartfelt.  <br> IYAAAA! BELL-KUN, DON'T TOUCH ME THERE~ </br>  <br>Megu-nee didn't know anything about the virus when shit first started going down either. She wasn't able to get to the booklet with information in it until they cleared the third and second floors. She had no way to take proper measures for this.</br>  <br>Rize would manage.</br>  <br><br>How many episodes until we get berserk Chino?</br></br>  <br>Chiya is alive and well!</br>    <br>I'd probably just tell her its all gonna be daijoubu.<br>While inside i wouldn't care.<br><br>No matter how much you pester me I will never like this dog.<br><br><br><br>Now that is just rude.<br>She'll make it, i know it!   ;_;  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 18 year old </br>  <br> We didn't die to nuclear war. <br>dude, give us a chance. it's only been 70 years</br></br>  <br>The Ayayayas had to fuse up into Kurumi to survive.<br>Then she became zombie Chiyo.<br><br>Good job, morons.</br></br></br></br>  <br> She'll make it, i know it!    ;_;  <br>Everything will be daijoubu.</br></br>  <br> THE DOG IS ALREADY DEAD </br>  <br>Yeah, well, fuck you. I know the dog's gonna die but I'll be sad.<br>We know Yuki'll be the sole survivor because  pink is always best girl. <br><br>Deal with it. Like the dog.</br></br></br></br>  I thought the episode was great. <br><br>The couple of changes to the original story are just big enough to keep people who have already read the manga interested to see what has been changed, while leaving the premise untouched.<br><br>I predict two things: <br>1. we'll get a flashback episode that explains how Miki gets to the school<br>2. Taroumaruu's 'disappearance' in the manga was extremely uneventful since the audience never quite sees it. Keeping the dog around to participate in club activities is a good thing. <br><br>I'm calling it now: episode 4, flat side with the shovel, in the sleeping quarters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Never forget.  <br>The other girls seemed to see him when it jumped on the table.</br>  Anime added hints that weren't in the manga, though I'm not sure whether it was intended:<br><br> Megu-nee: I'll have to write another apology letter because of Taroumaru running around the school. <br> Kurumi: Hey, we didn't have any causalities, it's all good. <br>   Megu-nee: I'M a casualty! </br></br></br></br>  Pink is the only good thing about this show. Unfortunately she's in the wrong fucking anime. Leave it to Japan to create ridiculously cute girls and then have them suffer.  <br>It will be daijoubu! i can feel it in my bones!<br><br><br>Very dead. Like. Shovel dead.<br><br><br> We know Yuki'll be the sole survivor <br>  Please no ;_;  <br><br>And, fuck the dog.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I assume you've watched Black Bullet?</br>  <br> the dog was only around for a chapter in the manga, and since it had been bit already, megu-nee seemed to have it chained up the whole time it was still alive. Maybe the dog is getting a whole diffferent backstory if he's not just a delusion </br>  <br>We've already been over the fact that the dog is getting a main role. And that role is being a tear jerker.</br>  <br>The virus probably has two stages: one that spread invisibly and created a large outbreak, and the later stage that only spreads through bites.<br><br>If the virus isn't present in zombie blood, but is present in their mouths, it's likely it makes more changes than simply animating a walking corpse. The delivery system could be something like a snake's venom.</br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't it the dog that bit Megu-nee?</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>It was obviously intended.</br>  <br>No.</br>   replying to baiting shitposter   <br>Nope, she got bit fending the girls from a crowd of zombies.</br>    <br>I'm just wondering what Not-Umbrella Corp was up to when they released the virus. I'm genuinely curious as to the reason.</br>    <br>I get the feeling the author is going to change how Miki joined the group.</br>  Maybe it's just me but this show does feel kind of "real" in a way. If something that devestating happened I'm sure you'd have some students staying at their school trying to pretend that life hadn't gone to shit. I also love post-apocalyptic stories because they make me feel this sense of dread so that might be it.  <br>The more you hate him, the more your waifu will love him. Accept him for the cute emotional baggage that he will be and embrace the fluffy future depression.<br>Just look at him, imagine you were 2d, wouldn't you want to puni puni his little paws together with Shovel too?</br></br>  <br>There are a bunch of underground shelters, evacuation plans and suppressants distributed everywhere. It was something the government expected.</br>  <br>I hope not, the shopping trip was one of the best parts in the manga.</br>  <br> tfw can't enter these threads to talk about the first episode because manga fags don't know how the fuck to use spoilers </br>  <br>The same thing all corporations are up to, making money. How a virus that turns people into flesh eating monsters would of made them back I have no idea but if zombie movies have taught me anything, If the people in charge can protect themselves and the situation is only a small town or just one city, they'll pretend they did nothing wrong and try to cover it up somehow. Still, you'd think after six fucking games of zombie outbreaks and all the other shit they've done, The people at Umbrella would try a new business model.</br>  soo, where are they putting all the bodies? Considering they're stuck on only several floors of the school, it'd be hard not to have a serious rot problem. The Stand had a chapter or two on post-outbreak clean-up, so I'm wondering if the author will ever put forth specifics  <br>Dog will be dead within two episodes.</br>  Is this worth picking up for 3 ep rule?  <br><br>I don't think my school had supplies to last months.</br></br>  <br>  wouldn't you want to puni puni his little paws together with Shovel too? <br>Stop this anon, you're hurting me. I don't want to like this dog. ;_;</br></br>  <br>They know, they just don't give a fuck.</br>  <br><br>Throw them out the windows and let nature do the rest.</br></br>  Up to which chapter are raws available?  <br>The school had a store. I just wonder why did they not stay in the underground shelter if it had enough supplies for months.</br>  <br>Everyone was using them pretty well in the threads before horriblesubs was released, but then animeonlyfags shitposting exponentially increased and everyone just started throwing out Megu-nee bites Kurumi.</br>  <br> implying you wouldn't mouse over every single surprise box regardless </br>  <br>My highschool did. Granted we had about 5k students there so we were 5 stories and 17 halls but we had a fully functional greenhouse and a huge court in the middle of the school that could be transformed into farming land. We also had a stock of food incase of a crisis (i.e 9/11, soviet invasion) or lockdown. Each room also had a crisis bag with medical supplies and a flare gun.<br><br> tfw you will never survive the zombie apocalypse with your high school buddies </br></br></br>  <br>There's only 35 jap raw and 37 Korean raw online.</br>  <br><br>Yuki has to attend class.</br></br>  This girl.  <br><br>Just read the manga man, 35 of the 37 chapters are translated, you could probably read them in 1-2 days depending on your reading speed and whether you let 4chan distract you.</br></br>  Piece of shit grimdark BS.<br><br>Wouldn't be surprised if it was written by that hack Urobuchi.<br><br>Holy fuck what a shitshow.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much this.<br>It ain't our problem.</br></br>  <br>I know a guy who read all of Berserk in a day</br>  <br>Tell that guy he's a fucking hero.</br>  <br><br>How many are still left untranslated or without raws then?<br>Or are 37 chapters all that's out so far?</br></br></br>  <br>There is line on how far can you pretend to be retarded.</br>  So I finally got round to watching the episode. Was pretty good except (and I'm sure this has already been posted several times) why was Miki there and why was the dog there? Are they going to veer off in their own direction or are they just compressing shit?  <br> rush through the manga to participate in the threads <br> miss details <br> only find out after reading the threads <br> pretend you knew all along and make fun of people who come to ask questions <br><br>Every time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I read all of Dragon Ball in a day. Is manga supposed to be long to read? I mean I've always been a fast reader but I don't understand how 35-37 chapters could take someone 1-2 days. That shit is like, 30-45 minutes tops.</br>  <br> already read the manga before the anime aired <br> mfw seeing yuki talking to all those "students" and megu-nee <br><br>Shit is very surreal as fuck... it's like watching tragedy while knowing what will happen and you can't do shit about it.<br><br> Also is Megu-nee still alive in this episode? IRC when they found the dog she was still alive... </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See <br><br>Volume 6 is out.</br></br></br>  <br>There's only 37 chapters so far.</br>  <br>Impossible, everyone posts the same 5 manga pages every single thread.</br>  <br>it's an american named company. and the japanese government had a whole network of safe houses set up in case of an outbreak. They made the virus cuz it's the standard bonkers u.s. military research program gone awry in anime.</br>  <br><br>I thought she only started pretending at around chapter 29. Before it seemed fairly genuine.</br></br>  <br>I read it in two, without sleeping. Tell that guy he's a fucking trooper.</br>  <br>She was pretending the whole thing.</br>  I was thinking on dropping this, until the anime dropped me.  <br><br>I didn't really get why Kurumi walked into a bunch of zombies at night until I read one of the threads, but I'm pretty dense.</br></br>  <br><br>There was no one there when she used the broom to kill the zombie. It's kind of weird pretending if she's all alone.</br></br>  <br> already read the manga before hand <br> wake up and remember it had aired <br> can't remember who was subbing it  <br> check CR real quick to see if they have it <br> one of their main pictures is the reveal the classroom is fucked up <br>Glad I wasn't spoiled for the manga version but I was genuinely waiting on the anime version of the reveal</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be honest i was confused about that till my 3rd time reading the manga.<br>Don't blame yourself.</br></br>  <br>it didn't look like anyone other than yuki was interacting with her, so I'd so no. sorry friend</br>  <br>Nope, if you look at the roof scene you can see Megu-nees grave.</br>  <br><br>How? I'm seeing this a lot with this manga. Like that guy who didn't understand what happened to the person at the radio station. I just don't understand.</br></br>  <br>she's been crazy the whole time, her crazy has just been getting more and more usefully attuned to the situation. she has been having more bouts of actual lucidity as the manga goes on</br>  <br> korean raw  <br> raw <br>This tickles my autism. It's still a scanlation even if it's in another scratchy written language no one can read.</br></br></br>  <br>actually these zombies at a little time of conciousnes where they will get back to the place they loved most.<br>They explained that for some reason , all zombie students went back to the school , even miki's friend (who died in a different place) <br><br>Or the dog that they trowh it away but managed to come back even when it was undead.<br>All animals are affected by the virus except pidgeons for some reason.<br><br>Sorry for my bad english</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck her while she's still warm</br>  <br>Retarded people are everywhere anon</br>  shoveldog the anime  I wish there was a zombie show where it's more of a black comedy affair like in High school of the dead with those two BFF's running from zombies only to die trying to sell the other one out, the loser who tried to go at a horde of zombies with a pocket knife thinking he was gonna go out like a badass and the teacher just flat out "Nope'd off the fucking building with nearly no change or second thought to his face as he went splat.  <br>I'm not quite sure how i didn't notice it.<br>I always thought she was going to look for stuff and until my third time reading through did i understand what miki was talking about.<br><br><br> she's been crazy the whole time <br>Even if she is deluded she wasn't crazy the whole time, some part of her knew what was happening. That part was Megu-nee.<br><br><br>Aha whoops, i just wrote raw cause i couldn't think of the word.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't Kurumi say something?</br>  <br><br>Oh yeah, there was the rooftop scene too. When we get there, Yuuri is up there by herself. But when Yuuri tells her to apologize to the rest of the gardening club, all of a sudden two generic students appear from nowhere. And they're waving stiffly and don't speak.<br><br>Of course, these things are easy to notice when you've already read the manga, but I wonder about those who haven't.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She said that to yuki and "megu-nee" responded.</br>  <br> Yuuri tells Yuki* </br>  <br>at some point they find a map with 3 locations , these 3 are: the school , an university , an a mall.<br>The girls survived in the school , miki in the mall.<br>These 3 places are from a outside company they mentionen somewhere , and make me think they planned it all.<br>Still just theory, nothing confirmed</br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly, what's wrong with these kids nowadays? School would have definitely been not the place I would have gone back to after turning.</br>  <br><br>Well, at first I thought the zombies didn't notice her because it was night.</br></br>  So the manga is going to have 3 "Acts," Right? The school was Act 1, that took about 30 chapters. So now we're at the university arc, Act 2. Wonder if it'll be another 30 chapters or if they'll be done with it quickly?  <br>I've never thought about that.<br>Maybe the final "act" will be in the shopping mall where the bunker is located.</br></br>  <br> anon clearly becomes infected during intercourse <br> message flashes across the screen. <br> "Don't be a nutter, <br> Wear a Rubber" <br>I'm surprised there haven't been any hip condom psa's involving zombies yet</br></br></br></br></br>  I really hope we get to see Miki before the rescue. The scene where she tried to act out her school schedule was one of my favorites.  <br><br>I figure the final arc would be at Randall Corp. Lab.</br></br>  <br> tan tan tata tan <br>I laugh at that every time, its adorable.</br></br>  <br>You mean the Randall Corporation building, not a mall.</br>  <br>What would they even do at the company? Assuming that it is the starting point of the outbreak and may or may not be fully infested by zombies? Or will the university be a dead end with none of the people in charge actually being there after all.</br>  <br> adorable <br>Were you that fucked up guy that finds suffering girls cute? Because that's depressing, not adorable.</br></br>  <br>When the part of you that knows what's going on is the talking apparition of a dead person, you're still crazy</br>  <br>Would you still do it if she got a bit cold?</br>  <br>No, i just find the little dance cute.</br>  <br>Depressing. Just imagine the strain of trying to do your everyday chores that are meant to be done in a group with a teacher, then having rest of the day doing nothing but staring at the wall.</br>  I WISH <br>THAT I COULD TURN BACK TIME<br>BECAUSE NOW THE GUILT IS ALL MINE</br></br>  <br>Gakko ga suki da!</br>  Mii-kun best boy  <br>I'm making it your problem, asshole.</br>  I was genuinely expecting another SoL anime with 4 cute girls.<br>Call me a filthy secondary, but they really got me good with this episode.</br>  <br>Oh shit, not a report.<br>What if i get banned? I'll have to walk all the way to my router and reset it.

Have this for now, anon. http://vocaroo.com/i/s0Xx0SrQnYOE</br>  <br>I actually second this. My recording equipment sucks and it's hard to play with the guys on titanpad without editing shit everytime.</br>  <br>I'm pretty certain most of the anons only record a few measures at a time and splice them together before sending them in.</br>  <br>Yep. I do that.<br><br>I wouldn't worry that much about equipment either, some of us record with iphone mics.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Really? Unless it's really different segments separated by a really long rest and I can't reliably do it otherwise I usually go for single take to preserve the same feeling of style throughout.</br></br>  <br>I usually record the whole song at once. I get too worried that I'll compress the file if I splice takes and the sound quality will worsen.</br>  <br> Dat haruhi guitar/drums <br> wind comes in <br> mfw </br></br></br>  <br> wasteland </br>  <br>Orchestr/a/ low brass cohort here - recording in chunks is the best way to go. Best way to do it is to run through all the parts once, and then rerecord any isolated sections that had problems.<br><br>You can usually rerecord chunks separated by rests of a measure or more and not lose the feel/style of the piece. The amount of takes Wasteland and Tank got was unreal.<br><br> pic unrelated, rip accordion players </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I am so sorry. I only wish that I could redo my part, but it's too late now.</br>  <br>Not a problem if you're recording in a DAW (Audacity, Reaper, whatever).<br> The "feeling" issue is definitely worth considering when recording in chunks, but if you can play a part consistently (comes with practice) then this issue is mostly mitigated.</br></br>  <br>It's OK /a/non, I only know how to destroy at least you can create.</br>  <br><br> Real World (Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita OP)  <br> Flute, Bb Clarinet, Alto Sax, Bb Trumpet, Trombone, E-Bass, Drumset <br><br>Aww man, I haven't played my sax in years and you're making me want to break it out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's beautiful.<br><br>Thank you to everyone who contributed into spawning that abomination.</br></br></br>  <br>No, fuck off.

Does that mean all other parts are taken for other songs?</br></br></br>  If we've got enough talent to write a fucking orchestral track, how is it that we don't have someone good enough to write a 4 part transcription for acapella vocals?  <br>Even if they're taken, we encourage people to double parts like in a real orchestra, although most anons don't like doubling for some reason.</br>  <br>/r/ing that this is included if it isn't too late<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Gwu<wbr>nJgLsm5U</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>I might as well be bad at all of the songs I want to if I'm going to be bad at any of the songs, some of my favorites are on there.

Those kazoos made me laugh so hard I cried a little.

It could be interesting to put together a madrigal for the next album.</br>  <br> 26:40 <br>/a/nons i love you so much.</br></br>  <br>Way better than /a/ sings.</br>  <br>Arrange it, submit it</br>  Dango Daikazoku arrangement finished.

You guys are amazing. </br>  I honestly like our Colors more than the original.  <br>It's a little comfier</br>   Somehow no Tsubasa wo Kudasai   Sis Puella Magica brought me to tears.  <br>Isn't it more like this?</br>  <br>It's great that you didn't realize how horribly out of tune everyone was.</br>  <br>I really liked it a lot more than I expected to</br>  <br>I could hear it due to being part of an orchestra for some years now but I didn't let it bother me.<br>I enjoyed a wonderful rendition.<br><br>I've been surprised by the entire album. In a real recording studio and with a little practice one would think this was done by actual pros.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I just noticed, is this in f minor or A flat major?</br></br>  <br> I've been surprised by the entire album. In a real recording studio and with a little practice one would think this was done by actual pros. <br>What I enjoyed was the passion. Sure, it wasn't totally perfect, but you could feel that everyone really cared for what they were doing, and for the project. And for us.<br><br>I know it's in the spirit of the boards to release it for free, but I'd pay like 5 bucks for it on bancamp or some shit.</br></br></br></br>  The last track is what I expected the whole thing to sound like. Well done anons, this is something we can all be proud of.  <br>I agree with everything you just said, even the paying of funds.</br>  <br>And I just watched Gakkou Gurashi</br>  Anyone getting bad gateway on the titanpad?  <br>Mixing quality is inconsistent, but this is a step up from /a/ sings</br>  <br>Get used to it</br>  <br>This is the TV size. It's in A-flat major.</br>  <br>Yeah. Titanpad goes down a lot.</br>  <br>It crashes all the time especially when there's a huge traffic like now, just refresh it after a few minutes.</br>  is the anon from orchestr/a/ that played the trumpet here? what mic did you use?  <br>Pretty Cool</br>  <br>There's a few of us. I personally used my  macbook's  built in mic</br>  <br>Here's the link for the sheets.<br><br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/t8<wbr>a28tadrolcm/dangodaikazoku<br><br>Again, this is sort of a basic arrangement, so feel free to record extra melody/harmony/percussion not in the arrangement as you please. I intend for the song to be /a/ sings-esque, the more the merrier, especially in the chorus.<br><br>I still don't see what  was trying to point out, but feel free to QC for me. I probably won't change anything though.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I think one the guys mentioned he used an SM57, you can hear him playing the first trumpet in Tank.</br>  i like it  <br><br>Some folks in orchestr/a/ literally use their phones. Wouldn't recommend it for brass - at the very least, if you can't shell out the money for an SM57+setup (it uses XLR cables) get a Blue Yeti USB mic. They're pretty decent.</br></br>   tfw im too shit to play any instruments <br> tfw all i can do is sing baritone tunes <br> tfw I missed all the /a/ sings shit <br><br>shit sucks</br></br></br></br>  <br>hahaha nice<br><br>wow it is very clear. i like it. did that anon also do Ren'ai Circulation?</br></br></br>  <br>Cool, duly noted.</br>  <br> did that anon also do Ren'ai Circulation? <br>I think that's a different guy, he also had a pretty decent set up though.</br></br>   Nippon Egao Hyakkei (Joshiraku) <br>the best one by far</br>  <br>you can whistle</br>  <br>What if you can't?</br>  Damn, you guys sound good!  <br>No luck getting hold of a euph?</br>  <br>Nope. I'll keep trying though.</br>  <br><br>OP here. I'd be more than pleasantly surprised if it did happen. I admit, the odds are against it, but I can dream.</br></br>  I wish I knew how to play pipe organ. I'd be playing right along with you guys.  <br>I recognize those two.</br>  <br>Member of Orchestr/a/ here. Thanks for the thread. We were actually going to make one this weekend but I suppose we don't really need to now.</br>  <br><br>No problem, Orchestr/a/non. Thanks for the based tunes.</br></br>  How many people have joined the orchestra after the hype and visibility generated from this thread?  <br>Probably not too many, but I'm sure a few.</br>  <br>The better question is how many will stay after today.</br>  <br>Organs would be amazing. I've always wanted to hear Bach and Buxtehude live.</br>  <br>1 sax guy recorded a pretty awesome version of ZZZ, which is 1 more than usual when a thread's up.</br>  <br><br>Pipe organ MIDARAMIDARAMIDARAMIDARA</br></br>  <br>About a Week ago?</br>  I love you orchestr/a/<br>Keep this up</br>  <br>9.5/10</br>  So have you guys done a symphogear song?  <br>I'm in tears, this is just amazing.<br>4 years of being here, and I still love you guys so much.<br>I wish I had a reaction image to more properly convey my feelings, but this is as close as I could find</br></br></br>  <br> Kazoo </br>  <br>I wish we would. Can I be Hibiki screaming? Better yet have 2 instruments do the Shirabe Kirika duet.</br>  <br>It's in the request list.</br>  I want to fuck an anon while playing the violin a la The Red Violin.  <br>Wow, nice. Maybe I should contribute next time.</br>  <br>You guys have shit taste but good job.</br>  <br><br>10/10 its beautiful</br></br>  <br>To be fair threads don't live that long, and people usually needs time to practice.</br>  <br>Join the pad, we're still alive and kicking.</br>  <br> all that kazoo  <br> no kazoo in tank! <br>it needed it more than any other</br></br></br>  Fun fact, most of the characters on the cover are the waifus of frequent contributors playing that contributor's instrument.  <br>You always have the acapella /a/ sings version.</br>  <br>Someone ought to send this to moot.

Night, anons. It's been an honor posting with you.  <br>who are you</br>  This has been a fun listen. Great work you guys!  <br>Good night.</br>  <br>This is fucking beautiful.<br>I love you guys so much.</br></br>  <br>The hero we don't deserve</br>  <br>Decent, but woodwinds really need to learn to tune their instruments, or at least editor needs to sync the pitch. Ready was a mess at the start.</br>  <br>That one was pretty fucked, it had no proper arrangement and people just made up their own parts on the fly.</br>   That fucking kazoo in Orange. <br>Why.<br>At least make it sound less like someone farting.</br></br>  Oh and whoever played clarinet, stop sounding so depressing.  <br>W-what? ;_;</br>  didn't expect the feels at 26:40 fuck  <br>I hope he actually means the clarinet.</br>  @maestro (since I can't access the pad): for this stuff 3 guitars would be ideal, one solo, one doing the powerchord rhythm and one doing fillers/harmony.  <br>You may prefer this version. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Fiz<wbr>UreCyJ88</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I take full responsibility for mixing in the kazoo.</br></br></br>  <br>But there isn't really a point where I hear three guitars at once. I couldn't just consolidate it to two guitars?</br>  <br>Dayum</br>  <br>Most of the times they play in unison, but you can hear a guitar playing filler bits around 0:42 panned to the right, it's probably possible to consolidate it to 2 guitars.<br>I like playing 2 rhythm parts and pan them to either sides for a fuller sound but it's up to you.</br></br>  I can whistle at most. Can I join?  <br>You did not. You played gorgeously.<br><br>By the way, do you use a plastic or wooden clarinet?</br></br></br>  <br>You guys should include Hikaru nara and Shiki no uta in this too if you can.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=O2d<wbr>sHq2EiwM</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_sc<wbr>cg1CZzi4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>whistlers always welcome https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dpv<wbr>SieKSzQ8</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Yes, join the pad.</br>  <br><br>That's fucking sweet. I'm in my bed on my phone at the moment, but I'll check it out in the morning. Super cool, totally will join. I'm going to work on my whistle all day.</br></br>  <br>Oh boy I get to talk specs.<br><br>Yamaha YCL 450 with nickel plated keys, wooden. Pretty much the standard intermediate clarinet. Mouthpiece is a Rico Reserve X5, and I use Rico/D'addario reserve classic 3.5/3.5+ reeds. <br><br>OK NOW YOU. This is fun.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> whistlers always welcome <br>Shit, I should join tomorrow. I was going to put it off until I had relearned guitar, but now I've got no excuse.  I whistle oddly, though, making noise by sucking in wind, instead of blowing out </br></br></br>  <br>I do a combination of both. I find sucking in is good for high notes but out is better for low notes.</br>  <br>Your pick reminds me, Strong would make a good addition to the second album as well,  hopefully with kazoos as well. .<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Zo9<wbr>a-j8iCqU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Are you trying to say you give blowjobs to men? There's no shame in just saying it anon.</br>  Is there any room for someone who produces digitally?  <br>Really? I hit much higher notes blowing out.</br>  <br><br>I can whistle with my mouth closed, it's not humming either since I'm not using my vocal cords. I don't know how, either. It's just louder with my mouth open.</br></br>  <br>Now if only we had a sizable string section.</br>  <br> RE@DY <br><br>I'm losing my shit here. This is one of those things that are so shitty that it goes full circle that it ends up being magical in it's own abortion-y way.</br></br></br>  <br>We can record different parts and impose them together.</br>   tfw titan-tan is being shy from all the attention she's getting   <br>Dang, what is with the dynamic range compression? Is this a badly mixed pop-album or is everyone playing with absolutely no consideration of dynamics? Some of you can clearly play, either the mix is bad or no one cares about musicality.</br>  <br>What if people are pressing the button because they don't know what it does?</br>  Truly, a classic of our time  This is so bad its bad. It would be better if the musicianship were more clearly awful rather than just bad.  <br> claiming that something would be better if it was worse <br><br>Never change, /a/</br></br></br>  <br>Damn that did not sound like it was from Love Live.</br>  <br>You're full of shit, few of the mixes if any have compression. It sounds like ass, yes, but because of kazoos, not compression. I doubt most of the mixers even know what compression is.</br>  Thanks so much for wareta ringo  <br>Seconding this.</br>  <br>Arranger here. Glad you liked it!</br>  <br>That's why you sound awesome, you son of a gun.<br><br>I'm on a plastic Buescher I repaired, Selmer 10 wooden neck, Fobes Debut mouthpiece, Vandorean Traditional 3.0 reeds.<br><br>I've gotta get me a wooden clarinet now for sure. I suppose I keep that mouthpiece in consideration for the future.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll have you reminded that we didn't play in an ensemble, we all recorded separately to a click track/midi and don't have a Terrence Fletcher to tell us what to do.</br>  <br>NOT<br>QUITE<br>MY<br>TEMPO</br></br></br></br>  <br>Except everything is at the same level forever. Both the melody and the drum sections are usually at the same level and they just stay there. Again, it's possible that most of its not compression and no one is bothering to bring the emotion. Fuck, you'd think someone would just go wild at some point. Sure, there's charm in the amateurish sound, but you can sound charming and still bring the soul. And if the performers don't do it, the mixer can help it along.<br><br>I guess this is the effect of the internet equivalent of phoning it in.</br></br></br>  <br> plastic Buescher <br><br>Oh. It's not THAT bad I guess.

I get nervous when recording and don't practice nearly enough, so I end up concentrating on actually making sure nothing messes up during the take than what I should be doing, which is expression. Almost every time I turn on the mic I get scared of overblowing which results in me playing way quieter than I usually do, which may be why someone in the thread said I sounded depressing. Even with this some songs still take upwards of 30 takes, and then my lips get tired and when I finally get a good take my lips are dead so it sounds weak even though I finally didn't mess up the rhythm. <br><br>I get it, I'll practice more to not disappoint anons. Thank you for your feedback.</br></br></br>  <br>Despite all the changes over the years, the /a/nons come and gone, I still love this place so much.</br>  <br>I didn't know you had it in you /a/.

Such solid picks /a/nons. So proud T.T</br></br>  <br>join*</br>  <br>In case you didn't notice the album is the equivalent of an Evangelion episode.</br>  <br>Since you're playing alongside fucking kazoos, it might be worth your while to not worry so much about playing cleanly. A flawed performance backed by dynamics and tone (forget tempo, you can't change that on a group recording obviously) will be infinitely more enjoyable than one played to the note without an ounce of expression. Well, as long as you aren't fucking up too much.<br><br>Man, I want to pick my Tuba back up after seeing this thread. Tubad I have a job.</br></br></br>  <br>An evanjelly episode goes for 51 minutes?

Tsubasa and Maria were standing on a beach after escaping Phara and then a submarine landed and lots of robot girls and different scientists voiced by the same person came out of it. Also there were Noise but they were friendly and disintegrated themselves before hitting humans.</br>  <br> they were friendly and disintegrated themselves before hitting humans <br>Being noise is suffering</br></br>  Want to rewatch this show and confused what series to watch.  if I'm correct DBZ Kai is just a remaster and better version of the original DBZ. I watched a lot of DBZ Kai recently and enjoyed it a lot more than the original, it does it justice.  <br><br>Watch the original. DBZKai is garbage.</br></br>  <br>Kai is more faithful to the manga<br>Z is filler city</br></br>  Kai is just some scenes redone in HD, some scenes censored and filler episodes are cut out.<br><br>But, DBZ fillers are GOAT so I would go with watching the original.</br></br>  <br>Nostalgia/Brolyfag &gt; Z<br>Faithful to the manga &gt; Kai</br></br>       bunch of shotas sucking each other's dicks <br>Its called Boku no Pico.</br>  <br>The Wheel of time. The One power and shit would look great animated + awesome sword fights, harem, and giant battles.</br>    Different studio for each tale  <br>I was watching the live-action adaptation and it was so terrible that I couldn't make it past the first ten or so minutes.</br>  <br><br>I think you've been reading too many trap doujins if that is what you interpreted from Ender's Game <br><br><br>oh man Hyperion by someone like I.G. or Bones would be neato</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That would be terrible. Incestfags would scream there's not enough Ender x Valentine content.<br>All the political net writing would be full of emoji. Yaoi fags would not even pick it up until shower scene. And you can bet your ass some retard would cram in 'floating with toast in the mouth in zero G' scene.</br></br>  <br> oh man Hyperion by someone like I.G. or Bones would be neato <br><br>They should do End of Hyperion, I think a diffferent studio for each tale would highlight the differences between storytellers<br><br>It would also not spoil a twist</br></br></br></br></br>  Farseer trilogy  <br>Movie wasn't THAT bad if you read the book before.<br>Shit went sanic fast though and they went full retard with the Formic fleet.</br></br>  <br>Branden Sanderson's Stormlight series would be neato.</br>    <br> Branden  <br><br> wtf. <br><br>Stormlight would be great.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OH MY GOD. I read those when i was in like 5th grade yo. That takes me fucking back. I still have the little shitty amulet you get with the box set.</br>  This would make one epic space opera.    Just make the martians look more like dark elves and you have an awesome sci-fi series.  Just read this series, Time slowing, western style gunslingers in a fantasy setting would be pretty fucking cool. Plus weird giant metal abominations that widows with swords have to kill.   All of these scifi genreplebs <br>disgusting<br><br>I cast my vote for a series of collected short stories by Joseph Conrad or Edgar Allen Poe</br></br></br>  <br><br>Concur on this. Its single character centric enough to be fucking great as an anime.</br></br>  <br>hurr a raven made me kill myself</br>  <br><br><br>Jesus fucking Christ, why are book covers always so fucking horrible?<br><br>Really, it's just one image you need. One fucking painting or drawing. Not that hard, you incompetent shitheels.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No.<br>Books 2, 3, and 4 should each get a 2 cour adaptation.<br>Then, after, they can make the first book into 2 or 3 prequel movies.</br></br></br>  The Witcher series seems tailor-made to be an anime.  I actually am surprised Ender's Game never got animooted in the 80s or whenever the nips were nutty for western SF.    <br>Right? When the stuff that's inside them is so great, the cover really just makes you wonder, what in the fuck?</br>  <br><br>next book when<br/></br></br>  <br> scifi genreplebs <br> Joseph Conrad or Edgar Allen Poe </br></br>  I just want my 2D Luna Lovegood  <br>Dont judge a book by its cover<br>˙͜&gt;˙</br></br>  <br>Exactly, thank you. I've never been able to understand this shit.<br><br>It seems that every publisher under the sun took that saying as a license to churn out shitty covers.</br></br></br>  <br>Little Witch Academia.</br>  <br>I laughed harder than I should have at this</br>  Pic related would be amazing, but I don't think enough nips read Narnia as kids to get hooked in.  <br>No they should do 1 and 2 side by side jumping back and forth between Ender and Bean..</br>  <br>That's why when i Said Wheel of Time i didn't post a cover. They are the furthest from what the book is actually like that you could possibly get.</br>  <br>Are you too stupid to process Conrad's style?</br>    <br>In a series full of absolutely shit characters, Luna stands out as a bastion of purity and moe.</br>  <br>Don't ever push Brandon Sanderson. That fuck writes like a god damned machine.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Here, have some Perrin Fan art.</br>  Anyone read this shit as a kid? Literally perfect for an anime adaption.  <br>Jesus Christ Superstar: The Anime</br>      <br>If he takes long enough, he can let some up-and-comer turn stormlight book 10 into 3 more novels!<br><br> He actually has a progress bar on his website. 8% through the first draft ;_; </br></br></br>  This would be perfect as an anime.  <br/>  Last to First Men and Starmaker.  I would love to see a proper adaption of Moby-Dick, but it honestly wouldn't translate well. Moby-Dick uses the written medium to its fullest potential. <br><br>Anything by Nathaniel Hawthorne or Mark Twain would be cool too. A lot of Le Guin's novels might work well as anime: The Lathe of Heaven, The Left Hand of Darkness, etc. <br><br>Also, Little, Big.<br><br><br>I read that book about a month ago and it was fucking terrible. I literally could not get myself to finish reading the last 40 or so pages, so I ended up dropping it, which is something I never do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can you imagine the huge uproar this would cause if this show was aired in the United States?<br><br>I know this is completely unrelated to the thread, but man, fuck the west.</br></br></br>  <br>Keep in mind the other stuff he's writing too, I mean. He's already got an extensive universe going on with Mistborn and Elantris, AND warbreaker.</br>  <br>Why do people think Ender's Shadow is the second book?<br>It's the fifth.<br>All the shadow books (anything that's not the first 4) can be ignored.<br>The first book can be ignored too actually - It's really just an extraneous backstory.<br> mfw most people didn't even read the best part of the series </br></br></br></br></br>  I'd like to see an old-school sword and sorcery series get an anime, maybe Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser.  Anything that's not the traumatizing English animation.  <br><br> Read series back in late-elementary/early-middle school <br> Even made an entire board-game about it as a school project <br> Found out there was an anime a couple years ago. <br> mfw <br>Now I really want to see the sequel series adapted.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This book is garbage.</br>  <br>Wait. <br><br> anime <br><br>IT HAS AN ANIME?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> delicious brown elf version of Dark They Were and Golden Eyed </br>  <br>stop demeaning people's religious texts, anon</br>  <br>No, it's literal garbage. It has no idea what it wants to be.<br><br>Fuck, the Shaver Mysteries are better than Battlefield Earth. And least that sticks with a tone.</br></br></br>  <br>Only if they looked like this</br>  I'm surprised no one has suggested this yet.  <br>it was a (admittedly bad) Scientology joke, calm down</br>  Or a series set in the Sprawl. Molly Millions would be my waifu.  Shitty Cover Incoming. <br><br>Rangers apprentice would make a great coming of age/adventure story.</br></br>  <br>Defending bad science fiction is never acceptable.<br><br>Pic related needs a good adaptation. Fuck Will Smith.</br></br></br>  <br>Because that stopped being funny in 2007.</br>  Donkey Hoetay  This would be amazing too, though the scope might be too much for a single series.  <br>Can't say Asimov without throwing Foundation in that too. Those would be great.</br>  <br>Already got one.</br>  <br>I know, he's ridiculous. It's awesome to start with an author from the beginning and look forward to the rest.</br>  Prose Edda<br><br>Norse mythology anime where all the gods are cute girls when????</br></br>    <br>Fuck off, /co/</br>  with Alejandro Jodorowsky directing it    Snow crash could be good if it had a decent budget and a good studio  or just letting Trigger do it.    I want sword and sorcery.  <br><br> Does Not mention the king of that genre. </br></br>  The Room anime when?  Directed by Yuasa.       young Anno will never make any other Jules Verne adaptations   <br>The last books were so dull.</br>  <br>Snow Crash had a plot like an anime just because of how over the top it was <br><br> Hiro Protagonist  <br><br>it would work so well</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just assumed it was a given. Besides, I read comics and I've gotten enough Conan in that form for two lifetimes.</br>  <br>keke<br>He would probably ask Miyazaki himself to voice a character</br></br>   novels that would make good anime thread <br> always full of sf and space <br> always. this is like a universal truth, one of the few things that all of /a/ agrees on <br><br> severe lack of good sf and space anime <br><br>I don't understand this.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Y.T. would be plenty of appeal to the lolicons</br>  <br>Isn't The Room basically a 'generic' NTR story if you take away all the comedy?</br>  Surprised nobody's mentioned Dinotopia yet.  <br>I'd like this.</br>  <br>we aren't japan anon</br>   still no bean meeting Ender in the future  <br><br>Why is the author such a slow writer.

They could do so much with these books do to their setting.
