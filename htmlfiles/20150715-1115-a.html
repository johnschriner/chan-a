Touma is throwing stones at her window to get her attention and Tsuchi, Aogami, Accel, and Shiage are playing in his band, doing a power ballad to try to get Fukiyose to fall for Touma. But she's just getting more pissed.</br></br>   mfw niggas actually taking the accel x misaka joke seriously   Pre-2000 Anime Thread<br><br>What are some old anime you are currently watching?

Btw punching someone less it not character development.</br></br></br>  PURE LOVE EDITION, Ntr fags please leave.  <br>I love Rank 4 but Rebellion just looks like a rubber dildo. His texture is so flat and it's something you can easily imagine finding in your mother's drawer. Only real Rebellion going on with that thing is rebelling against sexual dissatification.</br>   everyone freaking out about Sawatari vs Yuzu <br>It should be one of the better episodes. Probably the last real laugh we'll get before WHO COULD HAVE PREDICTED THIS TRAGEDY strikes yet again</br>  <br>He's come to Synchro.</br>  <br> it's something you can easily imagine finding in your mother's drawer. <br><br>Uhhh</br></br></br>  <br>The only laughs throughout the entire series so far has been Sawatari dueling. I want him to become the focus because he's the only one that doesn't try to be overly dramatic, depressed, or just fucking dull.</br>  Is Madoka Magica any good?  <br>I wonder what your tears taste like. I bet they're delicious.</br>  <br>You're right. Just look at my image. There was no love involved. Just  cheek rubbing. </br>  <br> innocence is an act <br>You just gave me an image of an alternate dimension Madoka who's dominating over a meek and submissive Homura, doing a nice footjob while being all smug of Homura's powerlessness.  Help </br></br>  <br>Why would you lie like that?</br>  Good night everyone. Never change /a/.  It's fucking finally time for some reverse NTR.  <br><br>Think he MC of Happy Abattoir Families fucked up the living manshit of the guy fucking his waifu but then he got arrested for attempted murder because of it and the girl walked right back to the dude for some more fucking. <br><br>Oyster needs jesus.</br></br></br></br>  <br>oh, and senpai is a rapist who basically just wants to fuck her because she's hot<br><br>Notice how basically all interaction between them in adulthood has been sex? It's his only method of reaching out to her.</br></br></br>  <br> things would've probably recovered <br>no because their sex life was falling apart he couldn't get it up</br></br>  Vanillafags are disgusting.<br><br>They read NTR and self-insert as the dude being cuckolded, not the bull.<br><br>You're huge maso faggots</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I thought I remembered something like that.<br><br>I call this contrived, because I can't make real sense of it. She was satisfying his fetish, right?</br></br></br>  NEXT G<br>http://g-tekketsu.com/</br>  <br>Fuck off Gentard.</br>  <br>Why are you posting a pic of cannibalism, anon?</br>  <br> 6 minutes <br>Good to see you only watched one episode</br></br>  <br> it seems even Tomino was disappointed with it though. <br>He said he liked it dumbass. The only Gundam anime he actually hates is Victory and he talks shit about all his works even the ones that are universally acclaimed.</br></br>  <br>I never thought of it that way.</br>  It's that time of the week again.  <br>I think there were a couple of anons talking about this could be happening after the 1st cour ended, but thinking back, the drama would need several new characters to pair with the sleeping one since the age gap is now bigger and a faster pace in their new relationship gonna make the 2nd cour feels like  forced shipping . I dont mind a 2nd season where the sleeping and the much older non sleeping get into a more intricate drama.</br>  <br>So Chisaki being Chistmas cake is okay?</br>  <br>Akira</br>  none of this is ok  <br>Why not, her drama wont changed much since tsumugu would be at the same age, the bonus is we get possible ss with hikari.<br><br><br> kaname not in anyone mind. <br>With sayu being a much older person, I dont think its gonna work or entertaining, I need drama anon, where no love polygon has been before.</br></br></br></br></br>  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>http://bitlasers.com/djt<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127957<wbr>481/</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Literature, Entertainment and educational material.<br>Also internet</br></br>  <br>と is a common conditional for linking repeating occurrences.<br><br>e.g., 家に帰って妻の顔を見ると、心がほっとする。<br><br>problems with your sentence:<br>俺は is not necessary<br>後時 makes no sense<br>帰った is a little strange, it's something that happens when you return home so it should use the nonpast<br>見える takes no object (it means "to be visible")<br>宥める isn't a terribly common word in this sort of situation<br>transitive verb doesn't make much sense as it's a natural response and not something you're forced to do</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes there is.<br>Being able to consume lots of films, books and games in their original language.<br>Some of which aren't translated to "your" mothertongue<br><br>Sounds familiar?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you fucking retarded?

Reminder that every girl is best girl.  <br> Miia  &gt; Everything else.</br>  <br>I'm not much for centaurs myself, because I'm a lamia lover and such, but I really do like Cerea as a character despite that.</br>  She's not my favorite girl, but she is rather adorable. I'd marathon LotR with her.  What the fuck, this isn't about cute girls doing cute things.  <br>Good.
