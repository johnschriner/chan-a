[ It's Friday, which means it's Osu day with /a/nons. <br>Join us and touch circles and have fun. <br>Room name contains /a/ and password is always "rage".<br><br>H/a/rd up for now</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Weekly reminder that this is the only way to get better: <br>www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=SlCRfTmBSGs<wbr></wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Also asking for all the OC of osu! threads like pic related.<br>I know I could use the archive and  but again it's for keep the thread alive a little longer.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How did the thread reach 400+ post last week?  Third for your weekly reminder: Eat fruits, they're good for you!<br><br> Catch the beat is fucking difficult </br></br>  <br><br>Maybe because the thread was made 9 hours earlier than today.<br>We should try and make them every friday at the same hour as well.</br></br></br>  <br>What happened, WWW?</br>        Keep the room alive!    I just came to the realization of the fact that there are some osu players that never heard of Ouendan/EBA.  <br> Ouendan/EBA. <br>Who are they?</br></br>  <br> tfw can't even do 2.5* ctb maps </br>   Didn't get a reply last week so trying again. <br>/r/ing some good stream maps around 3.5-4.5 star.</br>  <br>freedom dive half time</br>  <br> who </br>  https://osu.ppy.sh/b/124321<br>https://osu.ppy.sh/b/386140<br>https://osu.ppy.sh/b/386759<br>https://osu.ppy.sh/b/657054<br>https://osu.ppy.sh/b/306038<br><br>If you beat this on [Insane] your training is complete young one:<br>https://osu.ppy.sh/b/60743</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ok</br>  Have you anons attempted genryuu? Did you pass?  <br>Genryuu Kaiko, yeah? Easy FC. Only 4.61 stars. I don't know why anyone would be impressed about that.</br>  <br>Yea I FC'd Genryuu Kaiko by Mira-San already, i'm basically a God at this game.</br>  <br><br>Please <br> I almost passed 1/4 of it once, I'm basically rrtyui now </br></br></br>  <br>HW is a professional shitmapper anyway. That map would've never gotten ranked if it had been made by anyone who didn't happen to also be a BAT. Took an awesome song and just &gt;lol streams. Complete shit. No creativeness at all.</br>  <br>He's a BAT now, but I don't think he was when he was getting that map ranked.</br>    DON'T DIE ON ME  <br>We will have to do it more earlier next friday like this anon said  so we can have another 400+ post thread.<br>Well I'm out.</br></br>  <br>I'm willing to wait forever.</br>  <br>You mean the HW one? I can pass it if I'm lucky but some parts are annoying.</br>  /a/nything goes forever<br>https://osu.ppy.sh/mp/17727330</br>  <br><br>I would play but I still suck. I'm the faggot from last thread that was on level 10.<br>I spends all the time I can playing single instead of multi so one day I can play with you faggots.<br>I came to this threads just to help you with the bumps. Well now I'm out, good luck faggots.</br></br></br></br>    I'm pretty shit but i'm going to come because I know i'll get some good songs.    room is still alive  <br>joining soon</br>  why are you not watching the #1 mania player eat ice cream?  Anyone know q map of a Mirai Nikki OST song with a BG pic of Yuno on her knees holding a knife? I can't find it for shit.  <br><br>ded room</br></br>  <br>made a new one</br>  Are you here, Pupu?<br> Do you want a new pen? </br>  <br>https://osu.ppy.sh/s/86009</br>  <br> HW is BAT <br>top kek<br><br>The mania mapping community is full of incompetent faggots too</br></br></br></br>  <br> F1rstLove <br> #1 <br>Lolol</br></br></br>   Fear me, mortals! <br><br> Bow before the mighty Carol, and worship me in a manner befitting my glory! </br></br>  <br>Carol a cute</br>    Carol is a homunculus without genitalia.<br> Maybe if she had invested in genitalia she wouldn't be so cranky. </br>  <br>I'm gonna steal her hat.</br>  Wow.  Where did all this water suddenly come from?      <br>Miku's pants.</br>   Commie   <br>If this season is trying to make me hate Hibiki, it's exceeding all expectations. Bitch has literally zero redeeming qualities.</br>  <br><br>It is several hours past your bedtime, Carol. Time to sleep.</br></br>  GET IN THE FUCKING GEAR, HIBIKI  WHY IS HIBIKI SUCH A LITTLE BITCH  <br><br>She's wearing a skirt, not pants</br></br>  How the fucking hell do you use martial arts on an explosion.  <br>Pants and skirts aren't mutually exclusive yo.</br>  <br> I'm an autistic retard with an attention span of five seconds who neither understands emotions or cares about the background and the deeper aspects of the characters so I just judge a character superficially by what they are doing right now </br>   HOW DARE YOU SAVE EVERYONE YOU FUCKING CUNT <br><br> GIVE ME BACK THE GEAR I CAN'T USE RIGHT NOW AND APOLOGIZE TO ME </br></br>  <br> kissanime </br>  <br> streaming </br>  <br>What do you mean 'how'? You just punch it.</br>  At least she still has the butt  REMOVE HIBIKI    <br> Hibikifags will defend this </br>  <br><br><br>Can I ask what's your point guys? That Hibiki's insane? We knew it since S1. That her comfy perfect world is now falling apart? We knew it since ep 3. That she isn't perfect punch machine? What a twist!<br><br>I don't get you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can understand emotions just fine and still hate someone like her. When there are others who come from similarly bad circumstances and still manage to be more mature and sane, there is no reason to empathize with her or have any patience for her whatsoever.<br><br>Tsubasa sucked hard in the first few episodes for a good reason.</br></br></br>  <br> AND APOLOGIZE TO ME <br>But Hibiki was the one apologizing. Get your fact right.</br></br>  When did Kirika become so sexy?  <br> replying </br>  <br>Carol being an old body-surfing hag without genitals took away alot of her moe factor compared to her just being a pissed-off little girl.</br>  <br><br> She doesn't even have the best butt </br></br>    <br>You dissolve the heat by punching the molecules into different directions.</br>  Oh, you mean like how she just saved you and all your friends?<br><br> i-it only counts when I do it! <br><br>So Hibiki doesn't actually care about saving people at all. All she wants is the high she gets from feeling empowered and important.</br></br></br></br>    <br> So Hibiki doesn't actually care about saving people at all. All she wants is the high she gets from feeling empowered and important. <br><br>Typical liberal.</br></br></br>  How badly do you guys think an english dub of Symphogear would be butchered?  So what does this mean  <br><br><br>I was expecting some "sorry I fucked up thanks for saving my friends" speech.<br>That just upset me.<br><br><br>That's not even funny as a joke.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YkT<wbr>HtWX7CCY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>It makes me want to  protect her more .</br>  <br>The bed scene drove that point home too.</br>    <br><br>It means the protagonists are walking into a trap:<br><br> Autoscorers appear and overwhelmingly destroy Gear users and their relics but don't kill them  <br> Elfnine on the run from the Autoscorers but hasn't been recaptured despite the Autoscorer's ability to teleport wherever they like, and Carol and the Autoscorers haven't even mentioned Elfnine or Dainslef as an issue they need to deal with <br> Elfnine just happens to have a detailed plan on how to upgrade the Gears yet conveniently lacks proper data on the Autoscorers <br> red glow and spikes on the schematics <br><br>It's a setup. Carol and her girls destroyed the Gears to force them to use Elfnine's upgrades, which will definitely backfire. Hibiki's knocked out so she'll be out of commission, and while she's out Chris and Tsubasa will end up turning into evil brainwashed things to sing the end of the world or whatever. Hibiki will have to stop them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5TX<wbr>Tpik5wf4</wbr>  [ ]<br>Like this.<br><br>Also, everything's green on Commies, subs soon</br></br></br></br>    <br>Super Tengen Toppa Ame no Habakiri</br>  <br>Gattai?!</br>  <br>Most probably. I can already imagine Elfnine despair, when she realizes she was a  trap  all along.</br>  <br>Do keep in mind that, in the OP, all 6 users have the 'upgraded' converters. They're all doomed.</br>     now that Hibiki has become irredeemable shit, Kirika will replace her as the new badass short-haired heroine   <br><br> The entire anime is the same tier voice acting as THAT scene. </br></br>    <br>They'll get an evil spiky super mode that fucks them up mentally.</br>  <br>It'd be hilarious if the original VAs did the English dub.</br>  <br>Berserk GATTAI!</br>  <br><br>There is, because people are different and some deal well with shit and others don't.<br>You're being gravely unfair if you take the person who deals the best with something as an example and judge those who do worse according to that.<br>Everyone has their own struggles and fights their own battles, noone does equally well on all fronts.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I would watch it. Everyday.</br>    <br><br>Step it up.</br></br>  <br>The hot-blooded scenes and screaming magic would be gone.</br>  <br>Ayahi would be the only one you could understand. Chris becomes the only best girl.</br>  <br> Ayahi would be the only one you could understand. <br>We'll all be able to understand each other if we let our fists do the talking!</br></br>   bulge   <br>More spikes more evil.<br>Even Tsubasa's hair wing gets edgier.</br></br>  <br>Domon, pls   teach Hibiki the ways of the School of the Undefeated of the East  </br>  <br>I want to shove my face into that fluffy short.</br>  <br> seeing things that aren't there </br>    <br> the dubbing actors sing all the songs in japanese <br> all the songs are now shit   except Dark Oblivion </br></br>  <br> all the songs are being replaced by more western songs </br>  What happens if Hibiki and Maria activate Gungnir at the same time while holding hands?  The fucking OST of this show begs for a video game.<br>NANA PLEASE WILL IT</br>  <br>Hibiki transforms and Maria stands there wondering why she did that.</br>  <br><br>HIbiki becomes Maria's spear.</br></br>  <br>The relic jacked up Miku's ass activates and she'll fuck up Maria.</br>    <br>Tsubasa's turning into swords.</br>  <br>Beyond the BLADE becomes  RULES OF NATURE. </br>  <br>An evil sword to be precise.</br>  <br>This is a lot less funnier than it was now that we know there isn't a  trap  in the box.<br><br>Not that kind of  trap , anyway.</br></br></br>  WHY IS BIKKI SUDDENLY THE WORST GIRL?<br><br>WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO MY SYMPHOGEAR, MAN?</br></br>  <br>Symphogear game by Platinum when?</br>  <br> WHY IS BIKKI SUDDENLY THE WORST GIRL? <br> REWATCH THE FUCKING ANIME HOLY SHIT </br></br>   cliffhanger with the heroes getting fucked up <br> next episode the generic edgy villains retreat for generic edgy reasons <br> repeat forever <br><br>This is getting old fast. At this rate the first 5 minutes of episode 1 and beef stroganoff will be the only good things about this season.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Footfags fuck off.</br></br>    <br>An evil sword waiting to be purified with the holy song.</br>  <br>Maybe if you pester Kamiya on twitter often enough for it, he might think about it  and block you. </br>  What do Gary's kisses taste like?  <br>Salty milk and coins.</br>  <br>Memories of faceless men.</br>  <br>Ice cream.</br>  <br>Many men.</br>  <br>penis</br>    <br>The evil sword waiting to be purified by a holy singing sword to awaken as the ultimate sword.</br>  <br>If their actions didn't make sense or weren't consistent this would bother me, but it's made clear from the get-go that their objective is to destroy their gears and not them, so I'm not sure exactly what you expected them to do instead.</br>  Would you?  <br>Buy her some clothes? Yes, the poor dear must be so cold.</br>  I want to pee on Carol.  <br>Why would you piss on shit?</br>  <br>Also<br> SYMPHOGEAR IS MADE TO SAVE PEOPLE, NOT TO SAVE PEOPLE LIKE YOU DID! </br></br>    <br> her </br>  How's GX sales?<br> MOVIE WHEN? </br>  <br> How's GX sales? <br>I don't think we'll know for a while now</br></br>  <br>All 6 volumes are on the top of the list for this season's shows.</br>  <br><br>When do the BDs get released and why so late?</br></br>  <br> When do the BDs get released <br>Check the website  or the pastebin on /m/ </br></br>  <br><br>Sorry, I meant to ask, when do they become available for preorder?</br></br>  <br>They've been available all month.</br>  Somewhat bad news, today was the first day of the Nanatsu no Taizai FES and I saw quite a few people reporting that Aoi's throat was in a bad shape.<br>She still did her best at communicating through her body (something she excels at) and people seemed to enjoy her appearance during the event despite the issues with her throat.<br><br>Still it worries me a bit. And one can easily guess that the stress from recording for Symphogear has quite a bit to do with the state of her throat.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Can't be, if they were they'd be in this list already </br></br>  <br><br> There will never be a Symphogear game by Platinum <br><br> You will never play as Tsubasa cutting through Noise like Raiden cuts through cyborgs. </br></br></br></br>  Did Nana will all this?<br>If Nana willed all this, does this mean Nana will be the final boss of Symphogear?</br>  Has the Gaijin episode guide for S3 been updated yet?  <br> Can't be <br>If you mean Amazon sure, but I preordered mine from sites listed  ON THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE  like 2 weeks ago.  Pay attention. </br></br>  <br>Those are Amazon preorders.</br>  <br>Hibiki ruins everything.</br>  <br><br><br>Okay, point taken. Why doesn't amazon have them up for preorder yet if other sites do already?</br></br></br>  <br><br> aoi yuuki burns out her voice in the last episode <br> it's permanently fucked <br> her career is ruined <br> symphogear goes down in history as the show that killed a legendary Seiyuu's dreams <br> otaku fans burn their BDs and merch <br> staff never get work again </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Licensing?</br>    <br> Aoi Yuuki <br> legendary <br><br>hue</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Those thighs.</br></br>  <br>Japanese VA really are good with screaming with passion.<br> Aoi.Y needs to calm down a bit, she might zesshou herself and break more mics. </br></br>  <br>Keep reading<br/></br>   Symphogear A's actually habbening <br><br>FUCK<br>YES</br></br></br>  <br>Exclusivity contracts, I suppose.<br>http://www.symphogear-gx.com/produc<wbr>ts/GXpackage01.php</wbr></br></br>  <br>Aoi is gonna blow out her voice before Nana does.</br>  <br>Nana is the  boss of my heart. </br>    <br>Including my dick.</br>  <br>Aoi has been praised as a prodigy of voice acting by veterans of the industry since she was a teen.<br>But yes, she is a bit too young to call her legendary.(On the other hand, it has already been ten years since she started voice acting.)</br></br>      <br> BDs <br>Symphogear is all about the CDs, man.</br></br>    <br>Do we have sale numbers for Galaxy Cross and Hibiki's CD?</br>  <br><br> CDs <br><br> 2015 <br><br>what.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, RADIANT FORCE comes with BD1.<br><br>http://www.timeanddate.com/countdow<wbr>n/launch?iso=20150930T00&amp;p0=248&amp;msg<wbr>=Symphogear+GX+BD+1&amp;font=slab</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br>Symphogear BD&amp;DVD Sales Average:<br>(2012) *4,857 Symphogear<br>(2013) *8,653 Symphogear G<br>(2014) *10,999 Symphogear Live 2013<br><br>S1 CD sales:<br>Synchrogazer : 79,505<br>Meteor Light : 9,041<br>Zwei Wing : 28,044<br>Hibiki : 13,441<br>Tsubasa : 19,986<br>Chris : 13,698<br><br>S2 CD sales:<br>Vitalization : 81,793<br>Next Destination : 15,445<br>Maria x Tsubasa : 33,297<br>Hibiki : 17,692<br>Maria : 18,576<br>Tsubasa : 22,846<br>Shirabe : 17,305<br>Chris : 17,817<br>Kirika : 16,140<br>Miku : 15,802</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Symphogear <br> songs are a major part of the anime <br> not buying character CDs <br><br>Also King Recors really likes money, so more sales means more chance for S4.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They still sell a lot of CDs in Japan.</br>  <br>So am I allowed to do this then?<br><br>I hope she gets better soon.</br></br></br>  <br>Aren't the upgraded gears technically new gears?</br>  <br>That square is on two dead lines so it's not like it matters whether you fill it or not.</br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>Megumi Ogata's screams are still unparalleled.</br>  <br>If the Geahs get anything remotely resembling the Cartridge system from A's, my hype levels are gonna converge into a SLB.</br>  <br>Of course she will, Nana`s throat is fucking trained, that's why Nana never wears a fucking mask because she trains her throat to be battle-ready.<br>Aoi is more durable since her throat is not battle-ready.</br></br>  <br>HS is kinda shitty, but fast, so even SUBS WHERE is incorrect now.</br>  <br>Someone post those pictures of Hibiki`s line in S1 saying CDs include bonus and special features.</br>  <br>That's true, unfortunately.<br>I'll cross it anyway then.</br></br>  <br>Context wise, "new gears" probably means new users.</br>  <br><br><br>Do these cavemen also purchase VHS cassettes and rotary phones?</br></br></br>  <br>carol Isn't a custodian</br>  <br> he doesn't show support for what he likes <br>You're the caveman here.</br></br>  <br>But CDs aren't technologically outdated. They have higher sound fidelity than streaming services.</br>  <br>I bet you use itunes or similar shit.<br>Maybe even spotify, oh god.</br></br>  <br>It was true for one episode. It counts.<br><br><br>Cartridge system was great just for mech porn. I don't think SPIKES will have the same appeal unfortunately.<br>If the logo is Biki's new gear though, that would be amazing.</br></br></br></br></br>  Is it friday yet  <br><br>I miss VHS tapes. I remember back in highschool years ago we were cleaning out some old stuff in a classroom with some kids from three grades below us and found some VHS tapes and they didn't even know what they were.</br></br>    <br>Hopefully Maria can become useful enough to be worthy of that Signum style chain whip she's got in the OP.</br>  What are the subs like from HS with this?<br><br>Do they bother to translate the singing?</br></br>  <br>Watchable, not great.<br>Sometimes.</br></br>  <br><br>Be glad you didn't find any Betamax then<br><br>Or, God help you, 8-track tapes</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're inconsistent as fuck with the songs. They translated all but Glorious Break in episode 1 but no battle songs since then except Kirika's.</br>  That felt so satisfying.  <br><br>The fuck is Betamax?</br></br>  <br>I don't know, anon. Fuck everything about VHS tapes other than the satisfying feeling of putting them in.</br>  <br>You are.</br>  <br>Why isn't someone dies crossed out yet? Not like Chris actually died in that picture.</br>  <br>Watch HS for the speed after the stream/raw, wait for comeme/H&amp;D for song TLs.<br><br>stream &gt; raw &gt; HS &gt; comeme &gt; H&amp;D<br>proper order.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They're fine for speedsubs, some quirks but people tend to pick up on them.<br><br>If you don't want to wait for Commie then they're okay. Most people just watch it twice.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I only downloaded ep4.<br> no OP/ED, obviously, it's HS <br> Maria's song not subbed <br> Hibiki's song subbed, but it's a mess <br> different terminology <br>Ok for speedsubs, but I'm gonna download something else later.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>The quickest subs are the CR ones, which are rather subpar for English (but supposedly better for Spanish and German), but they don't sub the OP or ED and only sub some, but not all, of the insert songs. It seems as if the insert songs they sub are the ones that have already had their CDs released.<br><br>Commie is Commie.<br><br>H&amp;D is slow but highest quality.<br><br><br>Bluray is VHS as HD DVD is to Betamax.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They will never find your body</br></br>  <br>But then the next scenes destroyed my determination to fist.<br>Hibiki please be safe.</br></br>  <br>She died and came back to life.<br>Nobody knows what happened to Biki yet. Micha's dumb crystal didn't penetrate her skin or anything, and there was no blood.<br><br>Patience, Anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I actually forgot that it happened, and shutdown after the livestream<br>I just now watched it again with HS<br>I want to cry</br></br></br>  <br><br>Bikki will be in a coma for half the season then wake up and save the day. <br><br>Calling it now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Underage please go.</br>  <br><br>Actually it'd be more like this.</br></br>  <br>I really wonder why there's no blood when she fucking fell. She fell off so high yet there's no blood. <br>Maybe it was because her gear was protecting her till the end, or maybe it was animation error.<br><br>Kind of reminds me of Tsubasa when she saved Bikki from Nehustan Chris.</br></br></br></br>   this fucking third season <br>Its like I'm watching A's, but Nanoha is gone and Fate is side-lined.<br>I love it.</br></br>  This is no longer fanservice. This is porn. The best kind of it.  <br>Extreme soft core at best.</br>  <br>Anime is going too far<br><br>It is corrupting our youth</br></br></br>    <br>Epic dude.</br>  <br>Epic post anon, truly worthy of admiration.</br>  Settle down with your yurifag circle jerk  <br>For you.</br>  <br>B erserker  guy</br>  Remember how there were people last season saying they were going to tone down the lewd of the Kuro/Miyu kiss?  <br>HAS JAPAN GONE TOO FUCKING FAR ?</br>  <br>What is the meaning of that expression?</br>  <br>Rape.</br>  <br>I hope they will stop with their lewd shit actually</br>  You mean art. The best kind of it.   two characters kissing is now porn <br>What ever happened to this place.</br>  <br>This is a Christian imageboard.</br>   S1: Mostly story and progression with a small bit of lewd <br> S2: Mostly CGDCT with a lot of lewd <br> S3: Mostly CGDCT with even more lewd <br>It just keeps getting better</br></br></br>  Would you make Illya ahegao?  <br>Miyazaki was right</br>  <br><br>That sure was normal kissing.</br></br>  <br>Better make the most of it.<br><br>We're going to be knee deep in plot once 3rei gets animated.</br></br></br>  <br> <br>It's just yurishit so that people can do their to the letter robotic circlejerk over it like they always do literally anytime a show has this sort of stuff. It's downright Pavlovian.<br><br>I actually hope some people decide to counter troll this series a bit if people start getting uppity with spamming about Fate/Yuri shit all over the board. That subculture really needs to have it's shit checked more.</br></br></br></br>  Is it legal to download/watch the stream Illya in UK?  <br>No. It's haram.</br>  <br>Tell me about Illya, why does she wears the mask?</br>  <br>They only need to kiss. Why grind her crotch on her knee and do some nipple to nipple action?</br>  We need to go lewder.    <br>If you didn't see the first ep of new season kuro said that cunnilingus is a more effective way of transferring manga than kissing.<br>So yeah, about it, that is, yeah.</br></br>  <br><br>Because it feels good and they are gay as fuck.</br></br>  <br>For better experience.</br>  <br><br>No we really don't. The jokes not particularly funny anymore.</br></br>  <br>I'm from england, and probably not. You should be fine to watch it though (I have been with my years of doujins and shit), because they usually throw on loli as an extra charge if they take you to court for something more serious. As far as I know nobody has been arrested just for loli</br>  <br>Mana transfer works best when you're aroused.</br>  finally only good fate anime is back  <br>Man I wish I could watch this anime so hard.</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>Mah nigger.</br>  Subs fucking when?  <br> thinking type-meme is not a porn company,for it like you never heard of the erotic vn called fate/stay </br>  <br>brb calling my local imam- I mean local magistrate to report this criminal</br>  <br><br> not posting the webm <br><br><br>it's a set fact that fucking is the most effective way of doing mana transfer. The more skin contact and intimate you are, the better.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit quality. We need a new one since the raws are out.</br>  <br>I wanna pump that brown butt full of my sticky, viscous mana.</br>    <br>Why do I laugh everytime I see black Yosuke</br>  HOLY FUCK THIS OVA<br>MY DICK IS LITERALLY DRILLING THE SKY<br>gonnapostwebms in a bit</br></br>  <br>http://webmup.com/78780/vid.webm</br>      <br><br> static pics <br>Oh please</br></br></br>  <br><br>I want to  tickle  Kuro hard.</br></br>  <br>That reverse water censoring. I mean, usually their nipples are below the water, how come the pool is so shallow this time?</br>  <br>Well, I didn't know the tongue was covered by skin.</br>  Why do lolis love bathing so much?  <br> Vertical navel <br>Fucking horrible.</br></br>  <br>feels good yo. Also keeps your skin smooth.</br>  <br>all that unnecessary shirou<br>that's exactly why<br>I said I'l l do webms in a bit</br></br></br>  This is scary, /a/.

I hope this episode won't be a waste of time and try to shove in some "feels" in the last 5 minutes.

Translations are partway through volume 5, but there haven't been any updates to drive since the second chapter of volume 4. I've been holding off since I prefer not to read online, but if nothing's going to get uploaded any more there's no point in waiting.  <br>I Don't think Google drive is ever going to be updated. Just check these threads on Saturday when the mega link goes up.<br><br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>It feels like that's a lot of effort to recover her, considering how she left the Black Scripture, and how dangerous she is.<br><br>Then again, they might want that crown-thing back. Not that she'd know much about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, boss. I'd been avoiding the threads since I'm a volume and a half behind and didn't want to get spoiled. I should just catch back up so I don't need to worry about it.</br>  <br>It's not the Theocracy that's the prime worry (in a sense), but Zunanon, the organization that was the prime instigator of undead events until Nazarick showed up. <br><br>On the other hand, compared with Nazarick's armies of legendary and powerful undead; Zunanon's strength is relatively lacking. I can't wait for Ainz to put them in their place.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd love it if she was brought back to life only for Ainz to end up killing her again the exact same way.<br><br>You know if she is alive shes traumatized</br></br></br>  <br>Oh... but those guys are a bunch of necromancer terrorists. I'd be pretty surprised if they have enough positive cleric mojo to revive someone as something other than a mindless undead.</br>  <br> Ainz shows up to trash Zunanon and show them whose really the big boss <br> They all drop down and swear their lives to the King of Death </br></br>  So anyone know if we are getting 3 and 4 or just 3 tomorrow?<br><br>I mean the last three releases were 1.5 parts each</br></br>  <br> implying zuranon won't show up at his border asking to join the bone party in volume 10 or 11 </br>  <br>It does seem like they are a little bit ahead, but I thought that was just them doing a full chapter release every week, instead of doing .75 of a chapter.</br>  <br>Until Nazarick showed up, that's what necromancy was about. Stereotypical evil necromancers subverting nations for eternal life, often opposed by heroic adventurers and knights. <br><br>Then Nazarick dropped in, and now he turns people into liches daily, while Zunanon crawls around trying to utilize large-scale rituals to do the same thing that Ainz does in a few seconds by himself.</br></br></br>  <br>The one who died though, wanted to resurrect his mother right? So I'm assuming its possible at some point.</br>   have the whole volume translated and still only release one chapter per week <br>Fucking jews I tell you what</br>  <br>I'm guessing the intermission+ch3 though i would be pretty happy if they released 4 also</br>  <br>Intermission was rolled in to last week. It was the whole thing with Ainz counting his dosh.</br>  <br>He needed to destroy the entire town just to resurrect his level 1 mother, but if his theory was right then yea, he'd get his mom.</br>  <br> The entirety of Zuranon show up at Nazarick with their pillows in their arms, asking if they can sleep over. </br>  <br>Bah. D&amp;D already has a mecha race of outsiders. Inevitables are seriously underrated.</br>  <br>oh yeah i forgot about that, damn Im hoping they release 4 also then, though I kinda doubt it.</br>  <br>If I recall in the WN, Zunanon's cells in the Empire defect to Ainz.</br>  <br>Clem: why won't you die?<br>Papa Bones: Why clementine, i am already dead<br>{3spooky5me intensifies}</br></br></br>  <br>Go back to Ameri/co/ Mr. Hill. This is Chin/a/town.</br>  <br><br>He's right though<br>Sure they do it for  free <br>but still with holding chapters is pretty scummy<br>I appreciate what they're doing and that they even share it with us, I honestly don't know if I would or not if I put hard work into translating it all<br>but no need to be a dick about it</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>isnt that just a rumor with no facts behind it?</br>  Less than 8 hours to the scheduled chapter drop.  <br><br><br>I heard that they weren't done with the editing and proofreading.</br></br></br>  <br>it exist but<br><br>there excuse is that its not "edited" yet</br></br></br>  <br> :D <br>Fuck off skeletor</br></br>  <br>Or chapters are in editing/QC and your tinfoil hat is on too tight.</br>  <br>I dunno man, I feel that the quality of the translation/editing is higher than most groups. I'm fine with waiting for well written chapters.</br>  Would you guy play a game like Yggdrasil and waste all your money to become top player? Would you play it till the end?  <br><br>At least were getting chapters right? its not like any of us would do it. I would love to read them all now but ill take what i can get.</br></br>  <br>There have been alot of trolls around, don't take anyones word for this kind of thing.</br>  <br>Check your privilege, scum.</br>    Do you think Ainz is going to let Entoma kill Ivileye? Reading the 7th volume prologue looks like she holds a grudge.  Holy empire purging lich and undead alike scums when?  <br>Only if she chooses to not suck papa bones ' boner.</br>  <br>You'll have to ask Cocytus he has the ones that aren't made from China.</br>  WHERE PAPA BONES  Any ETA for the next episode?  <br>Our resident Thri-Kreen Umber Hulk used one to stomp lizardbros into the mud.</br>  <br>How about you go read the unedited Re:Monster chapters and tell us how it goes, they are uploaded for everyone to see unlike Overlord.<br><br>You're a fucking mongoloid for thinking it's legible without editing and proofreading.</br></br></br>  <br>I have. It's painful and mentally taxing, rearranging the order of words, deciphering meaning, and then trying to put it all together in your head. Like learning to read, all over again.<br><br>Doable, and it would scratch that itch in my skull for more material in the setting, but I'm okay with once a week releases. It's better than those shits at Re:Translations who can't keep a schedule, or even do placeholder work like the Re:Monster wikia guys.</br></br></br>  <br>she really wants that bone</br>  <br>god I just read this. it was glorious. They're never going to animate Clementine  giving her intestines a blowjob  are they?</br>  <br>At least they will animate Clementine  hugged by Ainz </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128562362 <br> Don't forget the spams too. </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128562362 <br>Most likely we'll  just get the sound, the horrified expression on her face, and probably censored puking and then her body going into convulsions just off screen as Ainz watches </br>  <br>Based funi.</br>  I keep imagining the beads and horns are pigtails and it makes him look even cuter.

I feel that this picture has a very nice potential for a good Papa bones edit, but I can't quite put my finger on how it should be done.  I just watched my first anime. Lovely Complex. It was... 10/10. But, i feel really, sad now. Lost. Ive been thinking about the show all day, the characters. I can't get over it. Ive just been rewatching episodes all day. Not intentionally, just to rewatch scenes, but i end up watching whole episodes. I cant get over this. What do i do? I don't want to get over this, but i feel really sad.<br><br>Why are western shows so shit in comparison? There not all bad, but no show has made me feel the way lovely complex did... is this how the anime infection begins? what is next for me?<br><br>pls help an anime newbie out. What was your first anime like?</br></br></br></br>  <br>God I fucking hate Pixels.</br>  <br>Well it is better but you don't expect this faggots to actually have good taste in anime.</br>  <br>Well since you started out with this genre of anime; I recommend you watch: Toradora and My Teen Romantic Comedy Snafu.</br>  <br>Both are shit.</br>  <br>Great taste anon, might is also suggest end yourself ?</br>  You see this? This is how it should be. Fucking chibi little shit I swear to God. Would it kill them to keep her this way?  Well that took an unexpected turn.   It made me feel so empty inside    <br>Yuki, no, take that out of your mouth, you don't know whrere it's been.</br>  <br> you don't know whrere it's been <br>Hot.</br></br>  <br> Miki without the garters <br>I hope the depravity club has their way with you</br></br>  Why do all the gakkous have such plump thighs? My favourite fetish  <br>I think she looks fine as is.</br>  http://manga.redhawkscans.com/reade<wbr>r/read/nisekoi/en/0/179/page/1<br><br>It's time.</br></br></wbr>  <br>And that's why the whole story feels so unsatisfactory to me. If you don't manage to get all your readers onto the same page, then you missed the mark with the romance plot. It's not even a very convincing play on the "false love" theme. The initial reason for the moniker was the mafia pretend lovers shtick, but that was mostly used in an unexciting way. Also, nothing false about the love of all those girls for Raku. Komi simply wrote a bunch of all round lovable girls and now all save 2 get shafted (the other "winner" being Ruri, since she was Shuu's foil from the beginning).</br>  <br>He does genuinely like Onodera, but he also has similar feelings for Chitoge. It's not about giving up on one girl so you can completely shift all your feelings towards another, Raku just needs to decide which one he cares about more.</br>  <br>I guess I didn't quite get my point across. Of course all the characters are puppets for the author, but the key to success is whether the author manages to make me forget that a character is running on rails, which I think Komi did not. When the meta workings of a story become too apparent to make things happen (e.g. a lot of (un)lucky incidences or the whole story unravels) then I fault the author, not the character.</br>  <br>I feel that Raku does like Onodera but he fell for Chitoge without realizing it. Ever since this moment I felt that subconsciously he cared for Chitoge more than Onodera.</br>  <br>Naw you got that point across, I just didn't think thats what we were talking about. I agree with everything you said about it being Komi's fault, I just don't feel bad for Onodera as a character.</br>  ITT: Sexiest in their Series  <br>Superior ship girl.</br>    <br>Hair is too long.
