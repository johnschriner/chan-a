He's throughout Water 7 and appears again in the Post-Enies Lobby arc. Otherwise, he's only appeared in the manga on covers.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Of course he does. Don't worry he gets plenty of screentime later on.</br>  <br>right??<br><br>how dare new fans want to talk about the series</br></br></br>  Why is Sabo so boring?  <br><br> new fans <br> talking <br><br>That's what lurking is for.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He turns up in a war at Marineford later, where Ace and Whitebeard both die.<br><br>He is now a homeless bum after fighting Akainu.</br></br></br></br>    <br>tumblr doesn't understand the concept of lurking <br>don't even try</br></br>  What happened to the other thread? OP fans being fags? What's new about that?  <br> have a question <br> lurk until someone decides to talk about your particular quandary </br></br>  <br><br>Yes, if you haven't read the fucking series already.</br></br>  <br>probably the 50 lines of BTFO in the OP</br>  <br>Ace Dies<br><br>WhiteBeard Dies<br><br>The StrwHat was first of Gol D.

He doesn't have a single negative quality, except maybe selfishness, but even that pales in comparison to Luffy's own.</br>  Is Sabo the worst character?  <br><br>Then fuck off.</br></br>  <br> over 18 <br> on 4chan <br>wow you are doing something wrong with your life  just like I </br></br></br>  <br>yeah, maybe you should leave to some other place that is less shit<br>see ya</br></br>  <br><br>You're in the wrong place m8.</br></br>  <br><br><br>no</br></br></br>  <br><br>I guessed that was the reason, but it wouldn't be the first thread shitposted by the OP that reaches the 500s</br></br>  <br><br>Then there is little use complaining.</br></br>  <br>you're right<br><br>i'll stop complaining and also take a page out of your book by deflecting all criticism as well</br></br></br>  <br><br>Good.</br></br>  <br>Just lurk a bit more before posting, it's really not that hard</br>  <br> fujo <br> tumblr gifs  <br> is an annoying faggot with no regards to board culture  <br>yep</br></br></br></br>  <br>THIS<br><br>YES</br></br></br>  <br><br>mods are persnickety sometimes</br></br>  <br>this place is shit anyway, why complain?</br>  <br><br>Because you are making it better, so fuck off.</br></br>  <br> complains <br> why complain? <br> shit place <br> Imma stay <br>Stop trying so hard, this is the only feeding you'll get.</br></br></br></br></br>  What happened to the Oro Jackson? Do you think Ray has it hidden?  <br>finally some logic! though im afraid you're stuck with me<br><br>better get used to the quality im about to dish out</br></br></br>  <br><br> OJ is the One Piece </br></br>  Is this going to be another 'bye-bye Doffy/everything's fine' plain garbage or is something important happening any time soon?<br> inb4 MFbaby </br>  <br> this is the only feeding you'll get <br><br>I beg to differ</br></br></br>  <br>I left everything I own in one piece</br>    <br><br>it's probably just capsised in raftel <br> luffy: oh my fucking god is that the oro jackson </br></br></br>  <br> Iol who's ice age guy going to come back <br> omg u won't answer my questions, elitists,!! </br></br>   tfw Oda will never make a series about Luffy being the greatest marine   So, Dellinger is a fish man, then why was he (?) shown in the flashback as a baby drinking milk from a bottle?  <br>he is jorah's son</br>  <br>And this is surprising because?<br>People do not routinely get put down for good in One Piece. It happens occasionally in Hunter x Hunter, but only to real dickheads, or if the guy doing it is sort of a dick himself. If someone shows bro potential they have a real chance of walking, however. Some characters are also soft, or can be. (Although clearly, not all the time. Killua will pull peoples heads off, but he's learning to make the choice not to. Although, observe how well controlled his father is and how he fucking ganked Cheetu. He squashed him like a bug.)<br><br>The Spiders of course, are also clearly quite ruthless although they have elected to walk/let other people walk, too. (Gon, Kil, still breathing, etc.) Some more than others. Some of them are fucking insane even by Hisoka or Illumi standards. (other examples. Hisoka lets worthy opponents live, people he thinks are annoying little bitches, he slaughters.)</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would you want a protagonist with no honorable goals?<br><br>While both pirates and marines are made up of good and bad people throughout, the huge difference is that the leading pirate figures are good guys while the leading marine figures are bad guys (morally, I mean).<br><br>Garp and Aokiji were the only good people at the top at Marineford and they were both disgusted with how things went down.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with that ? Did you expect him to drink shark juice instead or something ?<br>They just picked him up as a child. We don't know anything else.</br></br>  <br>false reports get you banned, you know</br>  <br>I wasnt that guy, plenty of people answered him as I was chewing you guys out</br>  <br> Luffy being the greatest marine <br> not Ace </br></br>  <br><br>Wasn't false though. <br><br>Announcing does though, but I couldn't give a shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like you</br>  <br> board culture <br><br><br>it was false though. The picture isnt nsfw. Reporting because your feelings are hurt is just spam</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> the picture isn't nsfw </br></br>  <br>prove me wrong</br>  <br>Nah, you're just effectively pissing in an ocean of piss, good job.</br>  The picture is in a spoiler.<br>The guy posted it because he knew it would get a rouse out of you.<br><br>Stop posting about it and going off topic.<br><br>Every time.<br>Every fucking time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nice tumblr image you got there</br>  <br><br> lewd faggot pictures aren't nsfw </br></br>  <br>If you're the anon who I replied to, then that's rich considering you had tumblr filenames.</br>  <br> lewd <br><br>where? I think you're just assblasted.</br></br></br>  <br>spoiler tags are for that <br>spoilers, it does not make you able to post nsfw images without repercussion</br></br>  <br><br>The picture with Zoro and Usopp touching eachother, sweating and blushing you faggot.</br></br>  <br>it's not me who particularly cares</br>  <br> sweating and blushing is lewd </br>  You idiots are so easy to trick with tumblr.  <br>can you stop replying to him you stupid faggot</br>  <br> Says an image is from tumblr to get a rise out of anon <br> Anon makes poignant observation <br> "I was merely pretending to be retarded" </br></br></br>  <br>ill train them out of it yet</br>  <br><br>No, I'm bored.</br></br>  <br> &gt;Anon makes poignant observation <br><br>things that never happen in these threads</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's pretty lewd.</br></br>  <br>then you are no better than him, you are probably the same fucking person <br>fuck this thread, this shit is unbearable <br>good job fujo pieces of shit, you got the better of me</br></br></br>  <br><br> then you are no better than him <br><br>Never said I was, it's pure entertainment.</br></br></br></br>  <br> In these threads <br>You stick out like a sore thumb that you're not from around here.</br></br>  <br> it does not make you able to post nsfw images without repercussion <br><br>which is why I don't post nsfw images<br><br><br>that's a nice opinion</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I expect young fish to eat what young fish eat, I guess. It's just an oversight, yeah, but usually Oda pays attention to small details like that.<br>Or have we had any reliable information on how young fishmen grow up?<br><br>Also, does Dellinger imply that some mermaid got shagged by one of these battle fishes?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If my boss saw that pic, he'd fire me on the spot.</br></br>  <br>They're fishMEN. They obviously eat anything any other man does. Stop with the stupid head canon.</br>  <br> frogposter <br><br><br>then you could sue for wrongful termination</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> wrongful termination <br><br>Not really, I'd agree with him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you worked for a professional company, you'd be fired for being on 4chan at all.</br>  <br><br>Apparently not.</br></br>  <br>then i guess there's no problem here and you should take from the experience that you shouldn't check spoilers while at work</br>  <br><br>Or just don't post nsfw images on a sfw board. <br><br>There's boards for that.<br><br>Spoilers are for spoilers.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah consider fucking off then</br>    <br> Or just don't post nsfw images on a sfw board. <br><br>I never do that<br><br>but you dont know WHAT is under a spoiler until you click it.<br><br>What if i'd posted an image that called your boss a jerk?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>BURGESS BTFO</br></br>  <br><br> I never do that <br><br>Yet you posted a nsfw image earlier.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Burgess: Aren’t you finishing me off..!?<br>Sabo: There’s no need…<br>Sabo: Looks like everything’s finished…..<br>Burgess: Soft…!! You and your “brothers”…!!<br>Sabo: ?!<br>DenDen Mushi: Brrrr</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>you dont get to define what nsfw is because you dont like it, m8. There's nothing lewd in that picture, you're just reactionary</br></br>  <br><br> there's nothing lewd in that picture <br><br>I'm happy I don't live in the US.</br></br></br></br>  <br>ZEHAHAHAHAH</br>  <br>Great... Ace got captured because he didn't want to actually kill black beard.</br>  <br>Fishmen are mammals, word of god.</br>  <br>Why is there no DRAGON INCOMING hype? Its probably Koala but people were convinced the shiny lights from the teardrops were from Kizaru</br>  <br>I'm so glad we didn't have to see this fight</br>  <br> I'm over 18 <br>So are the vast majority of One Piece readers. 60% are over 30.</br></br>  <br>If that were true, why does Oda continue to write it for 12 year olds?</br>  <br> what is WSJ? <br>kill yourself</br></br>  <br><br>It is still a Shounen Jump publication - you don't bite the hand that feeds you.</br></br>  <br>What magazine do you think this is?</br>  <br>It's easier to keep on writting a story for weekly 12yo readers who pay for WSJ and keep the +18 fans with boob-growing/sexual inuendo and buyfag material. Marketing at its finest</br>  <br> Implying it won't be shown in a flashback next week. </br>  <br>It's like the biggest manga of all time, if his audience truly was mostly adults, he wouldn't have to stoop to such lows just to keep himself fed.</br>  <br>What lows?<br><br>One Piece is still generally the same as it's always been.<br>Do you want his crew to be murdering people left and right because they're pirates?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Oda does with One Piece exactly as he wants.</br>  If FI is the halfway point, and right now we're generally at ch 800, we have 400 more chapters, give or take, until the series is over.  <br><br>That same audience keeps reading though.<br><br>If it ain't broke, don't fix it - Oda doesn't care about some whining neckbeards on a Vietnamese imageboard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>great, only 3 more arcs at this rate</br>  <br><br>*cartoon.</br></br>  <br>OP is a static manga, it doesn't grow with the audience. That's part of it's success, it makes the standards even on a progressing story, so there's less room for disappointment or error.</br>  King Neptune is best king<br>Queen Otohime is best queen</br>  <br>I just wish he hadn't reset everything with the timeskip as to keep catering to children. It's ruined the whole arc of the series because he didn't want the series to mature with its audience.</br>  <br>dellinger is HALF fishman, half human, and we don't know if fishmen drink milk or not, they are humanoids after all</br>  <br>This isn't a place for new fans to educated. This is a place for autistic faggots to read too far into every little detail of every chapter, and spew bullshit about our waifus.<br>lurk more faggot</br></br>  <br>This is fact.</br>  <br>Whut. The reason for the timeskip was the defeat of the SH pirates and the death of Ace. How isn't that maturing? The timeskip was necessary for the crew to gain a logical power boost. How else would zoro learn haki? From trying it?</br>   reminder that the doffy vs luffy fight is almost 4 and half hours long <br> entire dressrosa arc is longer than the lord of the rings trilogy  <br><br>I'm going to hang up one piece until the series ends and marathon this shit for two weeks, got the time off work ready to go.<br> my bosses faces when I explain why I need two weeks off </br></br></br></br>  <br>Cool blog man, where do I subscribe?</br>  <br> spending 8 years away from One Piece <br>I don't know how I could handle it.<br>All the fucking spoilers.</br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't go necessarily say the series needed to mature after the timeskip, but following up the most serious, high stakes arc (which had been steadily built towards) with everything Fishman Island was was a bad move</br>  Which part of One Piece brought the heaviest feels to you?<br><br>Pic related.</br></br>  <br> and spew bullshit about our waifus. <br><br>Im down for that</br></br></br>  <br>Garp prequel would be interesting. Seeing Roger conquer the unconquerable for no other reason than because he said so. <br><br>No fancy fruit powers, no power ups, no yelling your attack names, no relying on armies of fodder. Just a good old fashioned ass beating with fists.</br></br></br>  <br>do I have to remind you that hachi owns a takoyaki restaurant?</br>  <br>I mean the tone of the series itself, you dumbfuck. Everything was maturing until we got to the timeskip and clearly Oda thought the series was getting too dark because he reset it (getting rid of a lot of character in the process) to be carefree and took away all the seriousness and actual struggle.</br>  <br>spoilers ar not suposed to have nsfw pictures idiot, they are suposed to have spoilers, this is a blue board</br>    <br>This, Whitebeards eulogy, the Strawhats defeated. "I can beat you", <br><br>I love the flashbacks but the few present timeline feels moments get me much more. Crying scenes don't do much for me</br></br></br>  <br>screencap that rule for me, would you love?</br>  <br>i think you are the one who doesn't get what nsfw means, it's not just porn you filthy faggot</br>  <br>go ahead and define it for me as clearly as you can<br><br>can't wait to see this</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=83R<wbr>49SUddtg</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=imG<wbr>PrpcemyM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>the most based scene</br>  <br>The problem with you is that you can find the answer to your question if you keep watching.<br><br>Yknow, instead of wasting time asking stupid questions on /a/.<br><br>Also <br> watching the anime <br><br>Disgusting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you misspelled Cobra</br>  Why is he so sexy?  <br><br><br><br> using a op thread to discuss one piss </br></br></br></br>  <br>It's all the tan, bro.</br>  <br>Was Vista a fan of his?</br>  <br>read the note of the global rule n°5 faggot</br>  <br>Yea man so since you're in water 7:<br><br>Robin is going to get kidnapped by the guy from galley la. the leader is the dude with the pigeon. <br>Those people are actually spies for the government.<br>Ussop and Luffy will fight and ussop will leave the crew. The fight is because Merry is too broken and has to be replaced but Ussop is being a little bitch about it. So Luffy beats the fuck out of Ussop and abandons the merry.<br>Some guy named franky will show up and he will join the crew.<br>Robin will say she wants to leave but then the SH will get her back. <br>Luffy has 2 new special attacks that are somewhat like super saiyan.<br>Gear 2 and 3. Gear 2 makes him very very fast.<br>Gear 3 makes his fist or leg giant.<br><br>At the end of ennies lobies the crew is stuck there and the government is about to start a Buster call (basically they nuke the island) and the Merry saves the crew. Merry gains sentience for some reason. Then merry dies and Franky makes a new boat called the Sunny.<br><br>After ennies lobies they will go to thriller bark where there will be a skeleton and he's like alive and shit and he was part of the crew that Laboon. And so in this arc Luffy fights another warlord called Moria and beats him by eating a bunch of shadows and getting a powerup. Brook (The skeleton) then joins the crew. Nothing happens with Zoro<br><br>After Thriller bark they end up going to Shapondy archipelago where they have to get their ship coated to be able to go to fishman island and then the new world. Once there they meet a bunch of rookies that set of on the sea at about the same time as Luffy and that have been causing a ruckus like Luffy.<br>Luffy punches a Celestial dragon and the government is like oooooh fuck no and so bartolomeu kuma shows up and sends the whole crew to different parts of the world and Luffy cries like a bitch cause he couldn't defend anyone.<br><br>Wanna keep talking about this?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>took you long enough<br><br> i dont know how to screencap </br></br></br>   OP threads forever ruined with homoshit   <br>These 3 panels: http://www.mangapanda.com/103-2534-<wbr>12/one-piece/chapter-427.html</wbr></br>  <br>Merry's funeral. I was okay until Oda pulled the "I'm sorry... I wanted to carry everyone further" and I was a mess of tears.<br><br>Second place goes to Roci's death. The panel were Law's cries start having sound again is heartbreaking.</br></br></br>  <br> they are suposed to have spoilers <br> read the note of the global rule n°5 faggot <br><br> &gt;Spoilered pornography or other "not safe for work" content is NOT allowed on the work safe boards <br><br>why are you pointing this out to me?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We all did it faggot. Lurk moar b4 u post.</br>  <br><br><br>So once the whole crew is separated Luffy ends up on the island of Amazon Lilly where he meets another warlord. That warlord is Boa Hancock, the most beautiful women in the world. Luffy falls into her shower and discovers her terrible secret: she used to be a slave.<br>Then shit happens and Luffy learns that Ace is about to get executed.<br>Ace is the guy you meet briefly at alabasta that is luffy's brother. Turns out he is one of the commander of one of the 4 emperors of the sea. That emperor being Whitebeard, the strongest man in the world.<br><br>So Luffy is like oh no got to save ace so he asks Boa who has fallen in love with him to help him infiltrate Impel down. Impel down is the world's most secure prison and nobody has ever been able to escape from it. Except for one dude that was almost as strong as Gol.D roger.<br><br>So Luffy manages to enter Impel down and he wants to get to the bottom floor to rescue Ace cause ace is a dangerous criminal and thus places in the bottom floor.<br>Luffy meets Buggy and Mr 3 in the prison as well as Bon clay, crocodile and mr 2.<br><br>Before reaching the bottom floor he gets rekt by the prison warden Magelan that has a poison power paramecia.<br><br>Bon Clay manages to save Luffy by escaping to a secret part of the prison where Ivankov, the right hand of Dragon the revolutionary (Luffy's dad) has created a safeheaven for okamas. Ivankov saves luffy and decides to help him save Ace.<br><br>They get to the bottom floor but Ace is already on his way to his execution that is happening at marineford.<br><br>So they then free all the prisoners and escape. the prison but Bon Clay stays behind in order to allow them to escape.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy gets sent into an island full of women, and their leader starts lusting after Luffy's cock. Luffy finds out that Blackbeard caught Ace and gave him to government so he became a Shichibukai. Luffy then hitches a ride with the sexy leader who also happens to be a Shichibukai as well, and they're summoned to fight Whitebeard in an all-out war because he was like "Hell no you can't execute my son".<br>Then there's hijinx at a huge prison. There's a poison-guy and this other guy who's the best character ever. We meet several other people like Buggy and Baroque Works top dogs again. <br>Then Luffy almost dies. Several times. Good thing there's this huge fucking faggot who brings him back to full strength, and yet he can't save Ace from the prison in time. So he escapes with 200 or so other prisoners, making him and Buggy the biggest criminals on the whole thing.<br>Then there's a war at Marineford. Nothing much happens, except that Ace and Whitebeard die, Blackbeard appears with a brand new crew filled with the most dangerous people from the prison. Ace gets fisted to death and BB and co shoot WB to death. Then Shanks appears and is like "Yeah the war is over". Luffy cries like a bitch and THEN Rayleigh appears and says "Hey Luffy, let's train for two years".<br><br>Insert timeskip here.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hey will that cool ice guy show up again? <br><br> &gt;how dare you ask questions! Now im going to copy and paste the wiki summary to try and prove a point instead of just answering 'yes' or 'no' </br></br></br>  Is sabo confirmed? i guessed it would be a sabo chapter.  we getting an early chapter?  <br><br><br><br><br>Alright so Luffy has escaped impel down now and is header to marineford where the biggest war is about to happen. Whitebeard is going to go get ace back. But the marines want that to happen cause it's a chance to kill whitebeard.<br><br>and well <br>this<br><br>So then after the war is over and Luffy is healed he goes back to marine ford to cause a ruckus to let his crew know that they should take 2 years to train on their own before meeting up again.<br><br>Then they meet up again at shapondy archipelago?<br><br><br>Dude you said you wanted to discuss the manga. I'm discussing it.<br><br>Please feel free to ask more questions.<br><br>So anyway they all meet up again and they're like super strong cause you can see them one shot a robot that gave the whole crew trouble 2 years earlier and then they head off to fishman island.<br><br>When they get to fishman island they meet a group of fishman that hate humans and want to do bad stuff so Luffy beats their boss and we discover that the princess of fishman island is one of the world's ultimate weapons poseidon. She can talk to sea kings and have them do shit.<br><br>So then after fishman island the gang heads out to Punk Hazard where THE ICE DUDE and the lava dude that was also an admiral duked it out during the 2 year timeskip and the island is now forever half frozen and half on fire.<br><br>So there they meet Trafalgar Law the dude who saved Luffy's life during the Marineford war and he's a warlord now. So stuff happens and they capture this mad scientist that is like making drugs and that also works for Doonxiote DOflamingo, another warlord.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Dude you said you wanted to discuss the manga. <br><br>literally where?</br></br></br>  <br> this huge fucking faggot <br>Best part is that it's absolutely correct.</br></br>  This could be the worst One Piece thread I've ever seen<br><br>REMOVE TUMBLR remove tumblr</br></br>  <br> Please feel free to ask more questions. <br><br>So do you suppose Buggy and Shanks fulfilled ALL Cabin Boy duties on the Oro Jackson?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>i dont mind the homoshit as long as people aren't arguing for no reason</br>  <br><br> <br><br><br>So Law proposes an alliance with Luffy in order to take down an emperor.<br>That emperor is Kaidou and to take him down you need to take down doflamingo.<br><br>So they head to dressrossa in order to fight doflamingo but when they get there the whole plan goes badly and they have to improvise. <br><br><br><br>RIght there.<br><br>So anyway they make it to dressrossa and well the new admiral fujitora is there<br>as well as Burges one of the dudes on BB's crew.<br><br>So shit happens and Dofla gets BTFO like a looooot of times and now we think he's finally down.<br><br>Oh I forgot that at some point after ace dies there was a flashback that reveals that Ace and Luffy aren't real brother but more like how black people use the word brother and they had another brother called Sabo who supposedly gets blown up in the flashback but it is revealed that he is actually alive and the 2nd in command in the revolutionary army that Dragon (Luffy's dad) runs.<br><br>And well Sabo gets ace's fire powers and is fighting Burges. So now we're wondering if he beat burges or not.<br>There you're all caught up you little piece of shit.<br><br><br><br>No. I believe that they did no cabin boy work except for the occasional sweeping of the floor.<br><br>This is a shonen manga not some ecchi gay shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>God that looks horrific</br>  <br>Obviously Shanks did, why else would he have such an emotional attachment to Roger?<br><br>Buggy seems to just remember his past bitterly but maybe he serviced Rayleigh as he didn't seem to have a negative opinion on him.</br></br></br>  <br>just try and ignore them and hope they don't explode into tumblr tier shipping and general fujo-shit</br>  <br> RIght there. <br><br>that lack of reading comprehension. Have fun I guess</br></br></br>  <br><br>I can't not almost cry whenever I see this part again.</br></br>  <br>You were complaining that we didn't let new fans talk about the series.<br><br>Well I told you everything about the series. Now you have no grounds to complain.<br><br>And since you're caught up you don't have to ask retarded questions like: Is x going to show up? I'm too dumb to keep watching the anime. Also also too dumb to read the manga so I have to watch the anime instead.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm sorry... I wanted to carry you all further </br>  <br>I always figured Buggy was a nickname for his true job and he just got attached to it<br><br> but maybe he serviced Rayleigh <br>this is my newest ship actually.  Bad Touch Rayleigh is best Rayleigh </br></br></br></br>   i-it's just chapter release day! I swear threads will get better!   <br> You were complaining that we didn't let new fans talk about the series <br><br>that translated to summarize everything? Well I guess all we have left to talk about is speculation<br><br>Such as wondering why Whitebeard surrounded himself with boys</br></br></br></br></br>  Since this was a shit thread anyway I thought i'd ask. Anyone know of an old anime where kids raised monsters that fought each other and if they died they turned into round tablets?  <br><br><br> being this autistic </br></br></br>  Abandon thread, I'll see you faggots (the non-gay ones, that is) when 792 comes out  <br>LOOK AT ALL THESE GUYS!</br>  <br>that sounds like Monster Ranchers? It's been many years so i'm not 100% on that</br>  <br>Monster rancher maybe?</br>  <br><br>Thats it, thanks.</br></br>  <br>Don't expect the threads to get any better,last time there was Rebeccafag</br>  <br>All. These. Guys.</br>  <br>Where's whitebeard in your image?</br>  <br>I liked the peter pan guy, too bad nothing came about it.</br>  <br> look at all these nurses who just so happen to be women! <br><br>you're adorable</br></br></br>  <br> Wanted to take out his little brother <br> Sent his big brother to his execution <br><br> Doesn't finish him off <br> Nor showing any anger or resentment <br><br>Sabo is disappointing.He doesn't have to kill Burgess but come the fuck on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Where's whitebeard in your image? <br><br>in his chair probably?</br></br></br>  You will now remember Bogart  <br> peter pan guy <br><br>who?</br></br></br>  <br>He sliced up Coby's pistols, and beat Cobymeppo up. That's it.</br>  <br>That shark guy looks so out of place there</br>  <br>thats why he was forgettable still seemed like a cool guy</br>  <br>Namur has to be one of my favorites BECAUSE he's so out of place</br>  <br>He's the coolest one, I wanna know more about him. He doesn't seem to give a fuck, but must have quite a few tricks up his sleeves to be one of Whitebeards top guys.</br>  <br>The one in old European clothing thats right under the person who fought mihawk</br>  <br> first reply <br><br>this. fucking this. every arc has some point where everything comes full circle and this is literally the best one. ill see how dressrosa is once i re-read it though, just because kyros' story gets to me.</br></br></br>  <br>nigger, the anime is great up until thriller bark, in fact until the colored scans came out the most recommended way to experience wanpiss was to watch the anime up until the end of water 7 or thriller bark then switching to the manga</br>  <br>No the best way to watch something is to watch/read the source material.<br><br>So no matter what you say the anime will always be inferior to the manga.</br></br></br>  STOP THE PRESSES, SEAKINGS ARE REAL AND ONE WASHED UP IN RUSSIA<br>https://archive.is/Buido</br>  <br>What? No.<br>Just read the fucking manga.</br></br>  <br>I was disappointed to find out Haruta wasn't female but Oda just couldn't have one strong female character that didn't look like a hag, his explanation for why there were no women fighting at Marineford in Whitebeard's crew is pathetic and exactly the sort of disgusting shit that leads to worthless characters like Rebecca</br>  <br>except the scans were shit until skypeia after which they became shit again<br><br>holy fuck go back to reddit, you reek of new</br></br></br>    <br>Not buying the manga.<br><br>Don't complain about free stuff you fucking thief.</br></br></br>  <br> Not owning all the tankobons. </br>  <br>I'm really hoping we see Isho again on Wano. At the very least they'll find someone who knew Ace from the time he was there. Luffy needs to run into one of the Whitebeard allies sooner or later</br>  <br> https://archive.is/Buido <br>I love shit like this</br></br>  http://vocaroo.com/i/s0o5Dzbt8wOU<br><br>prepare your dick</br></br>  <br> Don't complain about free stuff you fucking thief. <br>If someone gave you an actual pile of shit for free you wouldn't complain?</br></br>  <br>If someone gave me shit by force I'd complain.<br><br>If I tried getting something that cost money for free and the only thing I found was shit, Then I wouldn't complain.<br><br>See the difference?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ecky things <br>Does this bitch not know that ecchi is supposed to be a belittlement of hentai?</br></br>  <br>oh Haruta<br><br>I didnt know he was peter pan themed. That's kind of neat</br></br></br>  <br>I dont think he is I just didn't know his name.</br>  From what episode is this screenshot?<br>It's when Luffy leaves Amazon Lily</br>  <br> not knowing the names of characters that were never named in the story <br>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</br></br>  <br> fucking a corpse </br>  <br>That's not Amazon Lily you fucking retard. But it's from whatever episode is the first one after the timeskip.</br>  <br> I'm really hoping we see Isho again on Wano. <br><br>I never even thought this was a possibility<br><br>I really hope this happens now.  What if the mystery samurai the Kin'emon and Kanjuro were travelling with was Izo? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Really? I'm not even close to the timeskip yet but the video I watched said it was Amazon Lily<br>Thanks anyway</br></br>   Oda is a Cameron Mitchell fan   <br> know most of them by name <br> cant remember what most of them do <br><br>I SWEAR Thatch is a cook but I can't find any information to back it up but I SWEAR</br></br></br></br>  <br> cook <br>Try 4th division commander.</br></br>  <br>The island is Rusukaina. It's close to Amazon Lily</br>  <br>Isho's childhood sketch has him dressing as a girl and his father (?) looking extremely distraught. I think the reason his uses guns is just to spite samurai tradition. He either lives there as an outcast or not at all, but I really want the former. The perfect straw hat allies are outcasts and weirdos</br>  <br>No yeah I KNOW that but he's also a cook<br><br>somehow<br><br>I think I convinced myself he's in Chef Whites but maybe he's just dandy</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most of the characters in One Piece are pretty lame, Oda isn't that great a writer, he's just been better than the average shounen writer</br>  <br> his shirt is blue <br>I think you need to quit while you're ahead.</br></br>  <br>What was his explanation?<br><br>And really, what do you expect from a Jap doing a kid's action series?<br>Oda doesn't even know that Chicks actually Dig Giant Robots.</br></br></br></br>  <br>perhaps but that shirt looked white to me<br><br>Has Thatch been in any official color spreads?</br></br></br>  <br>He said they purposely left all the women at home because of muh chivalry even though the women "begged" to come along. Meanwhile, some of his allies were women but they were ugly (and not actually in his crew) so they were allowed to fight.<br><br>The reason the question came up was because someone wanted to know if Haruta was female. He could've just said yes and retroactively made the story a little less childish but he didn't.</br></br></br>  <br> Whitey Bay <br> ugly <br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>It seems to be some sort of common misconception. There was some idiot asking how the Amazons were able to live on an island with animals powerful enough that they Luffy had to use the King Kong Dong. The island with the animals is uninhabited because of those animals. It's where he spent his time during the time-skip with Rayleigh and it's the only time anyone is known to be on the island.</br>  <br> He could've just said yes and retroactively made the story a little less childish <br>How would that have made the series less childish?</br></br>  <br> but they were ugly <br>I do not believe this nigger is serious.</br></br>  <br> &gt;they purposely left all the women at home because of muh chivalry even though the women "begged" to come along. Meanwhile, some of his allies were women but they were ugly (and not actually in his crew) so they were allowed to fight <br>Hah, what the fuck?<br><br>Oda really is a fucking Sanji. Its pretty laughable.</br></br></br></br>  Reminder Akainu's magma is hot enough to evaporate steel<br><br><br>He made the nurses stay home because they're fucking nurses. His crew is all men because he's an old queen</br></br></br>  <br>The anime design was alot uglier/shitter than the manga version, but you can say that about the op anime in general.</br>  <br><br>Whitey bay isn't part of WB crew,she's just an ally</br></br>  <br><br>Forgot about her. She doesn't count as she didn't actually participate in the fighting (in view). She just had a ship that was useful as a plot device for a brief moment.<br><br>He has lots of attractive women that are presumed to be capable of fighting but we never see them do it unless its just fanservice shit like Kalifa.</br></br></br></br>  <br> some of his allies were women but they were ugly <br> here's an ally who was a woman but wasn't ugly <br> b-but she wasn't part of the crew! <br>Dude, what?</br></br></br></br>  <br> He has lots of attractive women that are presumed to be capable of fighting but we never see them do it unless its just fanservice shit like Kalifa. <br>Wasn't Boa wrecking Pacifitas and pushing in Smoker's shit during Marineford?<br>Yes, yes she was.</br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't count because.</br>  <br>She's literally the definition of a fanservice character (though I do admit it's cute).</br>  <br>because she's a complete counterexample to your entire argument?<br>Okay, we'll leave her out then.</br></br>  <br> everyone who replies to my posts must be the same person I was talking to before </br>  <br> got Luffy into ID <br> told Ace about Luffy <br> got Luffy Ace's handcuff's key <br> saved Luffy after MF <br> protected Luffy during timeskip by hiding him away <br> helped him set sail right after TS <br> will probably help again in future if not show up to fight alongside him <br><br>Total fanservice tier 0/10.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You really didn't get that I was on your side here? The whole "because, period" bit didn't clue you in?</br>  <br> makes orgasm noises when hugged </br>  <br> you can't infer stranger's motivations on the internet because there is a . at the end of their post?! </br>  <br>You're mixing that up with Rebecca.</br>  <br>Look at the sentence. Look at it. It just ends where the actual "argument" should be. Do you know why? Get what I was saying?</br>  <br>it was pretty obvious by the way he replied</br>  <br>If you're Waifu would jump out your monitor to hug you, you'd do the same.</br>  <br> was going to let her entire country be burned to the ground until a man asked her to help him instead <br> got mad at other people for stealing the affections of this man who had no interest in her <br> did whatever she could to please this man despite him constantly telling her no and not even knowing her name <br> jumped into the fray when people were about to hurt the man that keeps her alive <br> would literally die, in story, if she were to stop lusting after this man who has moved on and forgotten her already </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*your<br>Fucking hell.</br></br>  Have we gotten any more spoilers?  <br>this is why I can't like Boa<br><br>she could have been badass WITHOUT lusting after a man to the point of stupidity</br></br></br>  <br> no wings <br>Fucking disgusting.jpg</br></br>  Do you think Luffy will ever be considered/consider himself as/claim the title of a yonkou?<br><br>I honestly don't, both for in-universe and for narrative reason.<br><br>The narrative reason is that then no one would underestimate him anymore, and enemies underestimating him is kinda part of the whole deal.<br><br>The in-universe reason is that Luffy would likely consider it as some kind of pattern somenone wants to force himself into, someone like the world goverment. And Luffy wants to be his own thing, or something.<br>He would either not accept the title, or not care about it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's wasting no time in the power/territory bullshit. If it happens it happens, but he's mainly going straight for Pirate King and a damn good adventure. Although I am sure down the line things will no doubt get political.</br>  <br> LOVE IS A HURRICANE!! </br>  <br>Well, in that scene it was literally impossible to have her as purely fan service, she was supposed to do _something_. So she got to beat up a vice admiral. (Weird how she didn't lose the title of Shichibukai afterwards.)<br><br>Her other fights are stuff like getting acid-undressed by Koume/Kotake.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think he'd care in the slightest, but the way he's gathering allies and territory and poised to take out Big Mom and Kaido, he'd be a de facto Yonko. Only thing is the story moves too slowly in-universe for that to even matter.</br>  <br><br> being a cocksleeve for the winning gladiators after their matches <br> sometimes becomes a cocksleeve for looser gladiators so they won't feel so bad <br><br>Rebecca is far too important to just be fanservice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Yonko is just something that gets assigned to you.<br><br>There's always the possiblity of Luffy taking them ALL out and being the Ikko.</br></br></br>  <br> Sanji said this to Zoro before their first fight <br><br>Boa's character is still dumb</br></br></br>  Why do people think Lola is Big Mom's daughter? Because she called Big Mom "mama"?<br>Well, all of Whitebeard's crew called him "pops".</br>  <br>goodness is it time to get lewd already?</br>  <br> im a what? <br> i dont care about that, call me what you want <br><br>this is literally what will happen<br><br>strawhats are just blundering their way to world domination</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It wouldn't make any sense. He's going to be the Pirate King, he will abolish the idea of Yonkos. The Yonkos exist because none of them are making a move for the One Piece, Luffy won't be content to just sit around owning stuff. He wants freedom.</br>  <br>probably the haircolor, lips and proportions?</br>  Guys!<br><br>Guys what if<br><br>Re D. Shanks<br><br>?!?!?!?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ugly as fuck <br> said her Mom was a big deal in the New World, her crew fervently insist on this too <br> started in the New World and left for Paradise <br> Vivi card would be a defense against Big Mom's wrath <br><br>However there's also this</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying you bought all of the tankobons <br> implying your not caught up with the series because you only read the paper material <br>gtfo</br></br></br>  <br> not Redhair D. Shanks </br>  <br>The life card she gave the crew is a pretty obvious set up for something.</br>  <br><br><br><br> Are you really doing this?</br></br></br></br>  <br> not Re D. Hair D. Shanks </br>  <br>you mean Shanks D. Red</br>  <br><br>this all hinges on whether or not big mom could get a guy to have sex with her.<br><br>and i find it hard to believe they would rather have sex instead of being killed outright to fuck that thing.</br></br></br></br>   People forgetting Kai D. Ou   <br>Even if Lola isn't her daughter, Bonney most definitely is. They have the same ship design</br>  <br> Nami has Lola's card. <br> Currently facing Big Mom <br> They have to get saved somehow if not by Monet </br></br></br>  <br>Cry more. Mods have deleted your tumblr pics in the past.</br>  <br> &gt;They have to get saved somehow if not by Monet <br>disgusting anon</br></br>  <br>I'm not even a monet fag, but she is a logia user, why wouldn't she survive the stab?</br>  Zoro's final enemy won't be Mihawk. It will be a Stairs Stairs fruit user  <br>Well, those stupid snow bunnies with the Sunny weren't placed there by Oda for no reason.</br>  <br>1 she wasnt expecting it so she couldnt dodge, and second he would use haki since he thought that was smokers heart and hes a logia too.</br>  <br> why wouldn't she survive the stab? <br>because we literally saw blood coming out of her heart. Which did not happen to any logia user before. She's dead. And why the hell would she show up on Big mom's ship and help the strawhats who are the enemy's of her master instead of trying to get doffy out of there? Are you underage?<br><br><br>what?</br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127446136 <br>I did not imply that she saved Sanji or something, that is retarded. Just asking why everyone is 100% sure a character in One Piece died, and, well, you convinced me.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127446136 <br>Did we get an explanation for those yet?<br>And if you dare say they don't look like her Snow Rabbits, I call bullshit on you.</br></br>  <br>People thought it was a signal for enel since hes on the moon.</br>  <br> Cry more. Mods have deleted your tumblr pics in the past. <br><br>they havent though. Not once</br></br></br>  <br>Anon are you a legit autist? Why would her logia DEVIL FRUIT powers have any influence on the water? We literally got the explanation that the weather and the water in the new world does whatever it wants to do. This image has nothing to do with monet.</br>  <br>And appetite.</br>  <br>Denial.</br>    <br> delusion <br>It would make no sense for monet to follow the strawhats like that and to do nothing until now after arriving in dressrosa. So fuck off with your fanfiction.</br></br>  <br>The arc is over and monet never appeared, that water is just water.</br>  <br>The user just can't swim. It's not like water negates any powers, Luffy could still stretch while being submerged (arlong park)</br>  <br>Also aokiji froze the sea</br>  <br> Weather and water does whatever it wants. <br> No, they just look similar by chance! <br><br>Also, :<br> Oda stated in SBS that Devil Fruit users are susceptible to all types of water, not just seawater. This includes the white sea surrounding Skypiea. He elaborated on this, saying that "moving" water, like rain or waves, does not weaken Devil Fruit users, while standing water does. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Plus when he and Robin saved Usopp from falling out of the sky.</br>   DIE FOR ME MONET <br> gets ready to blow herself up <br> gets stabbed in the heart first and dies explicitly on screen <br> hasn't come back for over a hundred chapters now <br><br>its oda's fault for not killing characters cause hes breeds logic like this, but i think shes really dead this time. he dropped his batman rule for new world.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> snow can remain it's substance on water and act on it's own following a ship, because it has it's own mind <br>wow anon<br><br><br>nice strawman, but aokiji had no influence on the water itself. He couldn't make ice spots on the water, he had to do a whole road and even said that it will return to it's normal state on it's own. So he couldn't make the ice grow larger o anything after freezing the sea ones.<br><br><br>So if luffy would have jumped from the boat he could swim, because it's moving water, you prophet?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No other counter-argument?Kay.<br>Glad to see you ain't got shit to disprove it other than being assblasted.</br></br>  <br>Only if they have physical contact with water. They are able to modify even water with they abilities unless they touch it. Just see how Kuzan froze the entire bay at Marineford.</br>  <br>And you literally have nothing to prove that monet lives, because even your bunnys don't look the same.</br>  <br>Oda's own words.Waves don't negate DF powers.<br>Problem with that?Write to Oda.</br></br>  Post yfw Dresrosa is almost 1/8 of One Piece.    <br>I think he's implying if someone on the shore or their ship got hit with a wave, they wouldn't lose their powers immediately. Though that would also imply that if someone somehow threw seawater at a Devil Fruit user (which people propose all the time), it wouldn't work.</br>  <br>Then you really need a pair of glasses or stop being in such denial.</br>  <br> Waves don't negate DF powers. <br>I'm 100% sure that your post has a shit translation, post the raw with an accurate translation or suck a dick. Waves or not, DF User can't swim.</br></br>  <br>I don't see the problem.</br>  <br>you should look at the images you posted first and stop your delusion.</br>  <br>So how assblasted are you gonna be when she never makes another appearance? You know, because she's dead.</br>  <br><br>How are waves not standing water?You can't be in a wave without being in the ocean. Does he mean getting splashed by a wave?</br></br>  <br> &gt;men dont wear these things! <br> fuck you dad! <br> &gt;men use swords not guns <br> I said Fuck You dad! </br></br></br></br>  <br> men use swords not guns <br>I can think of a few people who would take offense to that remark</br></br>  <br> nice strawman, but aokiji had no influence on the water itself. He couldn't make ice spots on the water, he had to do a whole road and even said that it will return to it's normal state on it's own. So he couldn't make the ice grow larger o anything after freezing the sea ones. <br>Are you for real ?<br>Or course ice will return to water because, i don't know, it melts ?<br>Fucking retard i swear</br></br></br></br>  <br>those look like perona's hollows</br>  <br>All of america ?</br>  <br>not all of it, just the south<br><br>maybe Nevada</br></br></br>  so /a/, here is the burning question<br><br>Who will be the next Strawhat?</br></br>  <br>You missed the point retard, he couldn't make a specific spot to ice in the middle of the water, the ice was conected by two islands and even then he couldn't move it after taking his hand of the water, so there is no way that your deadfu monet could make snow bunnys that move around at there own inside the water retard. If that was possible Akainu would make a lava soldier army passing the water to kill filthy pirates you retard.</br>  Reminder that we have already seen kaido .  <br>Jinbei.</br>  <br>None of those guys. They'll be part of Luffy's armada.<br><br>Would not be opposed to Barto joining even though I think his schtik would get old fast</br></br></br>  <br>It's Bartolomeo.</br>  <br>If it's not Ucy, there is no god</br>  <br>Moocy obviously</br>  <br>Well, explain me how he uses his bike on the sea, then. Are you even reading the manga ?</br>  <br> implying everybody's schtick in the crew doesn't get old fast <br>You could have probably said the same about Brook.</br></br>  <br>barto as the ship's cabin boy. franky will even build a little cuck shed for him.</br>  <br>where are Abdullah and Jeet now?</br>  <br>Yeah, there's multiple Straw Hats with more annoying schticks that are horrible characters when used too much, like Sanji for example (or really any of the Sunny crew).</br>  <br>his ice remains connected to the island he leaves from, retard, he can't be thrown in the water and suddenly freeze the ground water to stand on it</br>  <br>they were just random shadows from a sky island</br>  <br>I think Bedroom is actually funny though.<br><br>Also I already saw his character in that one guy from Hitman Reborn and it was annoying there too</br></br></br>  so are you guys ready for the last big reveal this arc has to offer?<br><br> Luffys attack was intense <br> fuck <br> It was so intense it knocked some sense back into Doflamingo <br> we see that his left eye is missing <br> he now remembers that he was tortured brutally by some world nobles <br> his "father" adopted him out of pitty <br> Doflamingo colapses physically and mentally because he lived a lie <br>The next things either happen after that or in a cover story<br> Doflamingo and all of the relevant others are rescued by Pica who brings them somewhere safe due to his ability <br> After Doflamingo wakes up he is a mental wrack <br> He begs Sugar to turn him into a toy <br> Pls erase my existence I want a new start <br> "and so the puppeteer becomes the puppet" <br> ODAAAAAAA <br><br>Pic also related, we might get to know soon who's behind Mr.Store too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;he now remembers that he was tortured brutally by some world nobles <br> &gt;his "father" adopted him out of pitty <br>I'm pretty sure that's fucking dumb</br></br></br>  <br>that's some fanfic tier writing right there if that was the case.</br>  spoiler when?  <br>  Right now.  </br>  <br>That was much earlier, this is right after Thriller Bark. We don't know what the fuck those things are, and it was implied they were responsible for ships disappearing in the Florian Triangle prior to Moria arriving. I don't think for a second it's Kaidou though, as it was stated this has been happening for a long time.</br>  <br><br>the eye theorie is haunting this board for a while now though. I myself don't really believe this will happen but something's telling me Oda might be stalling this one out until chp. 800 so he seriously might start another Doffy flashback</br></br>    <br>Oda can easily stall this out without adding another flashback</br>  <br><br> Law tries to kill Doflamingo  <br> edgy edgy edgy reeeeeeeeee <br><br> Sabo lets Burgess go <br> sabo is disapointing, most OP characters are pretty lame anyways, Oda isn't even that great a writer </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why is Issho is kawaii?</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it wont be anything though, I believe that this is a thing japanese usually do with horror movies, where after all is done and the evil is defeated you learn that the real problem is still there and will continue to fuck people over.</br>  Hoping at the end of this arc we get some reveal of the void century/will of d./one piece plots  <br>He's an  Admoeral .</br>  <br>I think I like that idea more than some arbitrary explanation that its a sea monster, or Sky Islanders shadows or whatever theories exist</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure we'll never hear of this ever again in the story. Probably just an easteregg to add mystery into that mysterious part of the sea.</br>  <br>Makes sense considering the whole arc was just about using horror movie tropes.</br>  <br>that was terrible<br><br>points for effort though</br></br></br>  <br>We'll probably have to wait until the end of the arc where Jinbe joins, then "oh robin I found this thing bet you all forgot the poneglyph"</br>  <br> Doesn't finish him off <br>Maybe therevolutioners doesn't want a fight with BB at this moment.<br><br>inb4 Teach would laugh like this<br> Boss, Burgess got rekt <br> Zehahahaha, that was his fate! </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that was terrible <br>That's probably the reason I didn't dare to post a pic of Carlos with it.<br> points for effort though <br>Thank you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I always wondered - why does Moocy have two asses on his face?</br>  <br>nigga what?</br>  <br>All that bullshits got to come out somewhere.</br>  <br>can't unsee</br>  <br>Pretty sure he will take his time wrap up this arc. It has been quite long. CP0, Partying, Character reactions, end of Doffyrosa</br>  <br> Moocy <br>It's Ucy, you faggot!</br></br>  Dentist anon, I believe you have some shopping to do.  <br>Seriously, why did people start calling it Moocy as if Funimation's subs haven't been wrong before</br>  <br>It'll have a huge impact on the story later on.</br>  <br>Hey, calm down, I was just going by that anon's post, since I forgot the bulls name myself.</br>  <br>Moo+Ucy?</br>  <br> that image <br><br>that shit is the stuff of nightmares</br></br></br>  <br>Original japanese name : Ucy = Ushi = cow + pun on Lucy.<br>English translation : Moocy = moo + pun on Lucy.</br></br>  <br>Is that why he's so  admirable? </br>  <br><br>Its the same pun but translated to english</br></br>  <br> it'll be Cowsy by the time Dressrosa is dubbed </br>  So I think we can all agree that this guy has an ant zoan. I mean what else is the strongest organism alive. Also it would make a lot of sense and tie into drake. Think about it, when drake was a kid he served a man who was weaker than him. Ants are usually weaker than dinosaurs. This is probably a mental thing drake has and supports the theory of kaido having an ant zoan.  <br>Maybe, I would pressure as much.</br>  Why are the Dressrosa side characters (apart from Barto) so bad?  <br>That's about as plausible as him having a Godzilla zoan because Godzilla vs King Kong.</br>  <br>lots of theories going wild there mate. The ant fruit would fit the One Piece theme very well but I have mixed feelings bout that one. Drake pretty surely has other reasons though, it would be fucking lame if he had some kind of mental damage.</br>  <br> Cavendish, Bellamy, Sai and Don Chinjao <br> bad <br>Say that to my face, not online.</br></br></br>  <br>every single one of them is better than every single new world captain we saw serving under Whitebeard. Hell they are even better than his commanders taken out Marco, Joze and maybe Vista.</br>  <br> Implying Cavendish was bad <br>I'll fight u on the streets m8, swear on mi mum!</br></br>  <br>Now we know Ace &gt; Blackbeard if only he wasn't so soft.</br>  What if Kyoani were in charge of the monogatari series? What would have gone wrong and would have been better?  <br>Pros: Background characters<br>Cons:  Background characters </br></br>  <br>Pros: art would have been more consistent<br>Cons: All the girls would suffer from same-face syndrome. Also they would have fucked up shinobu</br></br>  Kyoani face not nearly enough loliservice and the characters wouldn't look their age.  <br>It wouldn't be nearly as fun.</br>  <br>They will find a way to turn it into boring moeshit</br>  <br> Using moeshit when talking about Gataris. <br>everyone in Monogatari is moe. EVERYONE.</br></br>  <br>The monogatari characters already suffer from watanabeface</br>  <br>i cant name 1 kyoani girl with cowtits<br><br>does mio have the biggest bust?</br></br></br>  The art style would've been shitty  <br>I really love Kyoani, but I have difficulty to see Monogatari made by them.</br>  <br>Sento</br>  <br>Still better than Kyoani's sameface</br>  <br>Nigger, they might be moe but the series is far from being as boring as any Kyoani LN adaptation</br>  <br>I liked haruhi</br>  <br><br> moeshit <br/></br></br>  I want to be a cute girl and have Koyomi ravage my loli holes.  Everyone would have sameface and you would fall asleep during the show   kyoanus animating monogatari series <br>oh, god no.</br>  <br> better </br>  <br>Not really</br>  <br>But would anything be different?</br>  <br>I know that "moeshit" is a stupid buzzword that doesn't mean anything, but I wouldn't say that shows that only have moe as a minor secondary element are comparable to stuff like K-ON, Yuru Yuri, Lucky Star, etc.</br>  <br><br>Kinda like it already is?</br></br>  <br> implying SHAFT is ever on-model with his designs <br><br>Kek.</br></br></br>  <br>Koyomi would feel similar to Kyon and lose a bit of his pervert side</br>  <br>There's no thing such as watanabeface in the first place.</br>  Backgrounds would not be as abstract<br>There would me background characters<br>The animation would be better and more consistent<br>No flashing screens with solid colors and text<br>No necktilts or excessive face close ups<br>No excessive fanservice</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anime original characters to put their unnecessary mark on it, character redesigns, fanservice made more "tasteful" or outright removed due to fujos at kyoani and half the sales at most.</br>  We'd get better girls  What if hyouka was made by SHAFT instead?  <br>People would manage to stay awake</br>  <br>Headtilts, more sales and less people falling asleep</br>  <br>We would have gotten a complete adaptation by now</br>  <br>It would be shit then?</br>  <br>Aside from Bake and Madoka, Shaft shows don't really sell that much.</br>  <br>To be fair most Kyoani shows in recent years don't either with the obvious exceptions.</br>  <br>Did people expect Bake to sell as much as it did?</br>  <br>Then the first season would have been finished in time for the tv airing, the animation would have been consistent and flawless.<br>The art direction wouldn't be as strong though, and direction wouldn't be as quirky (wich is a part of the charm of the monogataris). <br>However Kyoani would still make some really nice choices here and there, and the overall direction would be better.<br><br>However, they may skip some novels and never fully adapt the story (maybe stopping at Nise).<br>That said, if KyoAni was in charge the Kizu movie would be out.<br><br>Different than what Shaft did, not necessarily better or worse, objectively better production, but probably not more thant two 2 cours seasons and a movie.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It would have been less pretentious, and probably likeable.</br>  <br>If they get serious and adapt the good stuff out there, they sure can sell.</br>  <br>Chitanda wouldn't be such a semen demon</br>  <br>There is.</br>  <br>Just like SZS right? And that shit was the BEST SHAFT.</br>  <br>Sure, one made in ripped pieces. S1 would maybe have 24 chapters if lucky, then S2 would, due to SHAFT not giving a fuck and being a lazy shit, have 16 chapters, then the next one would end suddenly at 8 chapters because YOLO. <br><br>The pinnacle of tidiness indeed.</br></br></br>  <br>Like Amagi.</br>  <br> Backgrounds would not be as abstract <br> No flashing screens with solid colors and text <br> No necktilts or excessive face close ups <br> No excessive fanservice <br>Literally another "why bother watching" Kyoani show</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the fact that SZS, a series that barely sold over 5k, got so many sequels is a miracle</br>  <br>To be fair all SHAFT shows through their history don't either with the obvious 2 exceptions.</br>  <br>The girls would be better, maybe even Hanekawa would be likeable</br>  <br>It's still better than getting nothing.</br>  <br>SHAFT gives no fucks about staying on model. Crab looks nothing like this most of the time in the anime.</br>  <br> implying only Shaft does that. </br>  <br><br>allegedly, the writing is good</br></br>    pros: nothing<br>cons: everything<br>fuck kyoani</br></br>    what if they merge?  <br>It wouldn't be fair for the other studios.</br>  <br>Having a Shinbo anime produced by KyoAni would be far more effective.</br>  I'll just leave this here.  Half the dialogue would be cut.  <br> uhh, all sorts of stuff happens and the talk a lot <br>are you autistic?</br></br>  <br>No but you are</br>  <br>What a hack.</br>  <br>You lost me at no tilts.</br>  <br> all sort of stuff happens <br><br>but that is good</br></br></br>  <br>kek'd at cat tilt</br>  <br> Slice of life <br> Slice of life <br> Slice of life / Comedy <br> Slice of life with a twist <br><br>I love Kyoani but this image is terrible.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As opposed to Shaft's<br><br> Romantic comedy/Supernatural <br> Comedy <br> Comedy <br> Comedy <br> Romantic comedy <br> Comedy <br> Comedy/Ecchi <br> Harem/Romantic comedy <br><br>?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This would be a terrible idea.</br>  <br><br>I love both KyoAni and Shaft, but no. Hyouka and Bake both worked great with their own studios.</br></br>  <br>Well, KyoAni did produce a few episodes of Shinbo's SoulTaker.</br>  <br>It would be mind numbingly boring, because Kyoani has no Shinbo.</br>  <br>Basically exactly the same thing as Monogatari is now.</br>  <br>Actually, best Shaft was Soredemo.</br>  <br>Shinbo didn't even direct Bakemonogatari or any of the sequels.</br>  <br> Listed as director in every trustworthy source <br> B-b-but some random blogger said he was hired only to supervise and teach, believe me </br></br>  <br>He did, actually.</br>  <br><br>If they took ghe freedoms they did with Nichijou, it be infinitely superior. But Kyoani would never do that again, so provably worst.</br></br>  <br><br>Even if it was just that, it still has his style all over it.</br></br>  <br>You should watch his older works. The "SHAFT style" isn't actually that close to his own.</br>  <br>But you're wrong.<br>I'm almost sure that this shit started with SZS, which was one of Shinbo's shows.</br></br>  I love this latest "Shinbo has never directed anything" meme.  <br>I remember watching Rec and Popotan, I think those were before Shitbo. They were pretty bland like JC staff shit.</br>  <br>So Hibike wasn't boring?</br>  Kizu would be released by kyoAni.  <br><br> REC <br> Same director as Lain <br> Bland <br><br><br>Shinbo didn't do REC</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> reading comprehension </br>  <br>Rec was horrible, so as Lain, fucking meme show with creepy character designs only good for a few reaction images.</br>  <br><br>how is REC horrible?</br></br>  <br>Lain and Kino were clearly a flukes, Nakamura is a hack.</br>  <br>Kamiya Hiroshi voicing Oreki.</br>  Speaking of the series, why hasn't SHAFT used any abstract Inu Curry scenes beyond pic related in first ep? I thought it was really good.<br><br>(file looks weird from my angle, test)</br></br>  <br>Yeah, just as I thought, the file is somehow corrupt.</br>  <br>That is a very dark picture, anon.</br>  <br>Because Ino Curry style looks cheap even by SHAFT standards. Nice pic</br>  <br><br> this shit taste <br><br>Go back to MAL.</br></br></br></br>  We wouldn't have gotten this beauty.<br><br>Also, episode 12 would have been nothing like it was. KyoAni can't into Romance. We'd also have none of those kissing scenes.<br><br>Fuck KyoAni.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Nichijou ranked 103 in MAL <br><br>They might even have better tastes than /a/.</br></br></br>  <br>KyoAni romances are the best and pretty diverse, Characters in these series don't need a kiss to validate their romance.</br>  <br> don't need a kiss to validate their romance. <br><br>Then it's not called a romance. At least fucking in Clannad they fucked.</br></br></br>  Waifu fags get in here. Post waifus, ask questions.<br><br>What kind of food does your waifu enjoy? Is she good at cooking it?</br></br>  She's a great cook, she has to be, after all she's already living by herself. I'd like to believe that we'll cook together whenever possible, that sounds like such a fun way to spend time together! <br><br>I love my Yunocchi.</br></br>  She likes donuts.  <br>Pretty much anything that is spicy. She's good a cooking simple foods, but it's much more fun to cook alongside her.  Which helps monitor spices used. </br>  <br>I think she would enjoy sweet, light sweets/snacks and dislike spicy food in general.<br>I don't think she would be especially great at cooking and so am I. It would be so Finn to practise it together.</br></br>  Surprisingly, she can, even if one might not expect that. She might even cook something extra special for me.<br><br>And I'm willing to wager that her favorite would be whatever she gets from her love,  me! <br><br>It's my first time posting my love here, it's always lovely to see so much love in the air.</br></br></br></br>  you waifu is now a lesbian.<br><br>would you turn into a women for her?</br></br>  She's an excellent chef. I would love to eat whatever she could make, not that I could get away with not eating it if I tried.  <br>Of course!</br>  <br>Yes, definitely.</br>  IROHA OR DEATH   what kind of food does your waifu enjoy <br><br>All of it.</br></br>  <br> &gt;implying I'm not already a dyke </br>  <br>Her cooking skills are actually noted to be pretty bad.<br>Of course, that just means I can have fun teaching her how to cook!<br><br>As for favorite foods, I assume that she likes light sweets and whatnot. <br><br> Heh. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Iroha is a good girl.</br>  <br>She prefers colder and neutral temperature foods. She struggles with cooking because she's bad with heat, but she still puts her heart into it if its for someone she cares about.<br><br><br>I can't do that. I am me, and I'm not a woman.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Is she good at cooking it? <br>No</br></br>  <br>Mai adores the cooking of one of her friends. It's practically the only thing she eats. Mai is an excellent cook, but her friend's cooking is special.<br><br>Mai was attracted to women at the start of her manga, but thankfully that changed around halfway through.<br>Assuming a magical transformation I wouldn't be opposed to that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Would you kill someone who tricked her out of her money for her and also lied to her?</br>    Would you say that your waifu is boyish or feminine? How do you feel about that aspect of her?<br><br>(Mai way rather boyish early on, as her roommate had remarked, but she learned to act more feminine later on. I liked that part of Mai's development.)</br></br>  <br>She would take care of it, and I'm sure it wouldn't be pretty.</br>  <br>She is very feminine, but I suppose her aggressive personality is more of a masculine trait.<br><br><br>Yeah.<br><br>What's your favorite picture of your waifu?<br> Pic related </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>mai is a 10/10, agree with you.</br>  Not sure if waifu is the right word since I never have one, but I really like her.  every one of her flaws and imperfections makes her even more perfect to me  <br>No. Mai was willing to show forgiveness to someone who tried to kill her along with all her friends as well as an entire city for good measure. She would never want such a thing.<br><br>It's very hard to pick a favorite image. I very much like this one, as Mai looks really cute and cheerful in it.<br><br>Mai is truly wonderful. It's hard to believe that such a perfect character can be a human creation.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying mai isn't actually a robot </br>  <br><br>Technicly araragi did, he is dead now, stabbed by that kid who he also conned money from.</br></br>  <br>Yep, "Araragi"</br>  <br>Her favorite foods are Cucumbers and Shiratama. However this is expected to grow after being introduced to the variety of foods in the human world.<br>Neither of the aforementioned are particularly hard to prepare so I'm sure she has no problems doing just that.<br><br>If we're talking magical transformation, then with pleasure!<br><br>More boyish.<br>Even when she was still a child her friends remarked her as "Being different than all the other girls."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> would you your waifu if she wasn't your waifu <br>She can't be lesbian if she loves me.<br><br><br>Feminine.<br>I love it, it allows me to properly protect and support her and feel like a real husband. I can finally feel that there is someone who needs me and who is grateful that I'm alive.<br><br><br>Probably this. I have physical copy of it on my wallet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She would do that herself, without hesitation. It's kind of weird, I have all these protective instincts, but she's extremely capable herself.<br><br><br>No such thing. But out of the more recent ones, I found this to be irresistibly cute.<br><br><br>What would your waifu do if she were to receive a huge surprise delivery order of flowers from you?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She likes Takoyaki and Sugar cookies, she likes salmon roe Sushi, she's tried doing some small stuff like cookies and riceballs, and they have turned out delicious, but bigger things are hard for her<br><br><br>There's too many to choose from, but this is one of them</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, ougi is technicly araragi, who send that kid to kill him.Stealing money from small children and hitagi kinda deserves the death penalty and worse.</br>  <br>She likes sweet things a lot. But in general, she likes anything delicious, stuff she can cook which is pretty much a lot since she's a great cook.<br><br>If it can't be helped...<br><br>She's very feminine and elegant. I just love that aspect of her.<br><br>I don't know, it's hard to pick. But here's one I really like.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mai Natsume is quite clearly a cute girl rather than a robot. She said so herself.<br><br>I think that Mai would be embarrassed by such an act. She can be rather easily embarrassed, especially with regards to things related to romance.</br></br></br>  <br>She's really feminine, even though she doesn't see herself that way she's really elegant and womanly<br>I love her for it</br></br>  Does your waifu have Shift JIS art?<br><br>Mai doesn't have much, but I did find a few pieces of her on this page:<br>http://yaruo.b4t.jp/index.php?id=Hu<wbr>kuTemp/その他作品/0・A/BLAZBLUE/BLAZBLUEそ<wbr>の他.mlt#.83.7D.83C.3D.83i.83c.83.81</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  Is there a character whose role is pretty much a stalker that won a bowl?  <br>this girl from durarara</br>  <br>Ah yeah totally forgot about her. Don't think she and the dude even had any lines in the recent season.</br>  <br>There is a bunch, yes. It's even utf8, so it's a lot more versatile.<br><br>http://anime.ja.utf8art.com/arc/nis<wbr>ekoi_14.html<br><br>Shame how the other girls in her series get so much more. But oh well, in glad for what we have.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Alice enjoys meats! I don't think she's any good at cooking -- she's never tried, I believe -- but I feel like if she had a good teacher, she could definitely make something delicious.</br>  Does your waifu ever wear glasses? Would you prefer her with or without them?<br><br>(Mai never wears glasses in official art. This piece of fanart is the only image in which she appears wearing any. That's fine with me, as I prefer her without glasses.)</br></br>  <br>I think she's somewhere moreso in the middle, not just one or the other.<br><br><br>It's usually not much of a surprise as I always buy her flowers for her birthday, but I'd like to think she'd appreciate a random act of kindness like that.<br><br><br>It's the first picture I ever saved of her 7 years ago.  This is our anniversary month too. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, fuck, it's Wednesday, isn't it? I've got my head so far up my ass from my work week. Well...this thread is one way to stay on track then!<br><br>Rin is all about the chocolate. There's a Valentine's gacha in the game where Rin is baking chocolate with the care of a pro baker, and she literally says her favorite food is chocolate in the anime. So I'm going to go out on a limb here and say it's  fish. <br><br><br>...sure, why not. Men's clothing can get boring anyway, and until I can look like a Final Fantasy or Pokemon character without the weird looks, I think I could have fun with the freedom of women's fashion while I'm at it. Depending on what I look like genderbent, I may have to go dyke...<br><br><br>Definitely not cutey or gal, but still definitely feminine. While I'm not built on raging testosterone, being with someone that can actually contrast me instead of being another me is...a surprisingly nice break in life.<br><br><br> gets flowers in the mail <br> works in a flower shop <br>Unless I got her, like, a bouquet of crystal flowers, or impressed her with something exotic not found anywhere in Japan, she'd probably slap the shit out of me thinking it's a bad attempt at ironic humor. And I should deserve that, if that were the case.<br><br>Alright, so let's say your waifu has multiple canon continuities: Which canon continuity do you base her characterization off of? Or do you mix-and-mash between continuities?<br>If your waifu only has one canon continuity, or does not have any canon personality (asking the latter with some of the Vocaloids in mind), are there any popular depicted fandom characterizations that you like of her?<br><br>CG has mostly has two continuities now, between the game and the anime adaption; I mostly view the game as the "main" canon that I base Rin's characterization from, but since there are some elaborations on known canon materials in the anime, there are some things in the anime I accept too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you faggots actually retarded?<br><br>If your waifu becomes a lesbian fuck the gay out of her with your dick. Don't turn into a girl for her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>All kinds! She's not bad, just prefers to let other people do it for her. <br><br><br>probably. Being a cute girl could be fun. <br><br><br>neither really. she just...is. <br><br><br>She'd appreciate it, say thanks. I'm not really sure how someone should react to flowers</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's hard to name just one favorite image, so I'll just leave you with just one of them.<br><br>She'd appreciate the sentiment and look after them.<br>She doesn't seem like much of a flower girl so I can't picture much beyond that.<br><br>I haven't found any.<br><br>Nope, while I do have fanart saved of Rukia donning glasses I don't believe she has ever worn any in canon.<br><br>There are a lot of people out there who claim current Rukia is a different character entirely compared to old Rukia.<br>While I believe she is still the same person at heart, it is without doubt that Kubo has fucked up Rukia's characterization throughout the progression of Bleach.<br>It's not character development, since taking her out of the limelight and stripping her of deuteragonist status Kubo has failed to successfully replicate all the traits and quirks that made me initially fall in love with Rukia in the first place.<br>Needless to say, while I love Rukia in her entirety my preference is drawn to her early character a lot more.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  i' dont have a lot of time today so im just going to ask a question<br>I'm having an eye surgery in a few days,because of this surgery im going to be blind for at least one or 2 days and im going to have to stay in bed without veing able to do anything at all<br><br>i've been thinking about using this time to daydream as much as i can <br><br>so i wanted to ask<br><br>how exactly do you guys have all this dates you speak of in your replies, i have only been able to have a date during a lucid dream and i just wanted to know how do you guys do it all the time, or do you guys have  tulpas[/spoiler?<br><br>idk i guess i need tips on how to fantasize at my own will<br><br>i fantasize all the time but it just happens randomly it's not something i can really control</br></br></br></br> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kagura tends to eat healthier foods like rice, she can't eat too much junk if she wants to stay competitive at swimming.<br><br>In terms of cooking, she's not great at it. Not completely awful, but she doesn't have a great deal of experience in it. I'd love to learn how to cook with her at some point.<br><br><br>If there was absolutely no way to make her straight again, then sure.<br><br><br>She's the tomboyest! I feel it works well with her sporty nature.<br><br><br>That's a tough one, there's a few that I really like. I'll go with pic related on this occasion.<br><br><br>She'd be very surprised and grateful, I'm sure.<br><br><br>She does, there's even an AzuDai flash animation featuring it, which Kagura appears in a couple of times.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=c5l<wbr>aYwpWzhc</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br>She never has, nor have I seen any art of her wearing any. She might look cute in them though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's a big fan of Japanese cuisine and she's pretty good at making it herself.<br><br><br>Feminine. I like that side of her.<br><br><br>She's worn glasses a few times, despite having perfect vision. She claims they help her to think better when wearing them. I think she looks cute with them on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't but they would look extremely cute on her<br><br><br>She'd be delighted, she loves flowers</br></br></br></br>  <br>I usually daydream or fantasize when i'm about to sleep and try lucid dreaming from time to time</br>  <br>You can't call what her cooking anything but "edible" usually, but she tries hard. She loves all kinds of food, but especially savory snacks!<br><br><br>Not literally, but I'd go to every legal end available to make them wish they were never born.<br><br><br>The epitome of feminine. Except for her cooking skills she's basically the ideal wife-and-mother type, and that's really what made me fall in love with her.<br><br><br>She'd be an embarrassed mess for the rest of the day, and probably bowl me over the second I got home.<br><br><br>No, but she looks surprisingly good in them.<br><br><br>Attached it. I just want to kiss her stomach until she breaks into a giggling fit.<br><br><br>I never knew "dating" your waifu was a thing, but every night I do give her a kiss and tell her how much I love her.<br> Although it feels just enough like when I could do that with a real woman that I worry about myself. anyone else that can relate? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is certainly both. She lets her boyish side show more than her feminine side, but ultimately the feminine side of her is very strong as well.<br><br><br>She'd be pretty surprised for sure.<br><br><br>She might briefly borrow the glasses of a friend for the purpose of amusement, but she doesn't need glasses and she doesn't wear them for looks either. I think glasses wouldn't really fit her, but obviously the design of the glasses is also relevant and I don't know a lot about it so I could be proven wrong.<br><br><br>I do as much stuff physically as I can without looking like a retard and imagine the rest. If I go to a concert with her, for instance, I actually go to the concert and then I just imagine her being there as well.<br><br><br>Won't post a pic because I don't have my pic collection with me right now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you OP.<br><br>She seems to enjoy food with her favorite veggie, the negi/leek/spring onion.<br><br>I'm sure Miku knows a thing or two about cooking.<br><br><br>Yes.<br><br><br>Miku is all feminine.<br><br><br>I have too many in my collection and many more I need to recover the authentic versions of after discovering a small amount of pictures were samples.<br><br><br>She'd be really touched and happy. Surely she'd really want to cuddle later.<br><br><br>Well, just imagine anon. Think and close your eyes. Picture her by your side or in front of you. Try to imagine the feeling of anything nearby or the ambience.<br><br>Just some advice. I fantasize about her every so often, but I've never really done it beyond a minute because it fills me with so much  despair.  Another thing I do is write little stories of us together.<br><br><br>What scenarios do you often dream/imagine you and your waifu in throughout the day/at bedtime? Dates? Doing a favorite hobby together? Adventures? Proposal? Your wedding day?  Lewd? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She has a portable rice cooker and seems to enjoy it quite well.<br><br><br>That doesn't work.<br><br><br>I don't think she could ever get into that kind of situation. And if: She could easily deal with it by herself and probably would with nobody ever hearing something about it.<br><br><br>She is very feminine.<br>And i am totally okay with it.<br><br><br>Too many.<br><br><br>I hope it would make her happy.<br><br><br>No. Never. She doesn't need glasses.<br><br><br>Yes but not too much.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  She likes most anything really.<br><br>She has her tomboyish aspects.<br><br>I like this one a lot.<br><br>Punch me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She might like anything, but she knows how to cook well!<br><br>I wont, i would better become the manliest and the most handsome man on earth, so she can be back.<br><br>Shes very femenine when it's necessary, like a date!<br><br> Laptop is kill, i'm posting from my phone, but i love those sketch style pictures, pic unrelated though <br><br>She might be the one for you, <br>anon.<br><br>She will blush a lot, followed by a hug and then a kiss.<br><br>Wished she would, but i'm sure she wouldn't like to.<br><br>She got the manga and anime adaptation, but pretty much its not so different.<br>I fell in love with the anime one, but i still love her, so it doesnt matter where its the manga or anime.<br><br> Use your imagination, but if you can't, just relax and think about her. <br> Anyway, hope you get well soon after that surgery, anon! <br><br>Usually a date on a park, or we would be watching a movie at my house</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I imagine doing most of the things I do with her, except the boring stuff. I did imagine proposing to her when I felt like our relationship was at the point where it was appropriate,  and I do imagine doing lewd stuff with her occasionally. </br>  <br>You have no idea how happy your posts make me feel, Takaobro. Thank you.</br>  <br>Without question.<br>Would I be able to go to happy comfy magicland too?</br></br>  <br>Extremely feminine. I enjoy it.<br><br>I don't know if it's happened before, so i can only guess beet red face as the only answer.<br><br>They are an upgrade so I would accept them, but nothing beats default for me.<br><br>I just do it. Either a setup at home, or setting up at a restaurant. I'm not being loud or disruptive so no one bats an eye or says anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At night, a lot of cuddling and pillow talk. I'm too shy for the other stuff.</br>  <br>Erica adores potatoes and sweets. She also enjoys pasta, pork, and white asparagus. As for her own cooking, she was forced to sign a paper prohibiting her from doing so on base. Now, in order to save us both from poisoning, preparing food is up to me and my average skills.<br><br><br>Miyako has a good taste for food - one can never have enough fire!<br><br><br>By magic, sure. By surgery, hell no.<br><br><br>Elements of both but more boyish overall. Staying indoors, eating plenty of food and then drinking until passing out isn't the most feminine idea of a great day. I love that aspect of her! She's a low-maintenance girl and easy to spoil, which I like to do often!<br><br><br>Nope, unless she's disguising herself as her twin sister Ursula! For obvious reasons, I'm allowed to call her sister good-looking without annoying her but of course I prefer her without glasses.<br><br><br>I'm in the minority of people who took the tulpa route all the way. It's extremely difficult at first, sometimes hazardous, and thus not wise for everybody. I'm happy though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She loves Macaroons<br><br><br>She does act very feminine, but shows some boyish traits here are there. <br><br><br>She just likes wearing them, she doesn't need glasses to see. <br><br><br>She'd love it, probably give me a hug and some kisses.<br><br><br>[spoilerI just think about her whenever I want.[/spoiler] Good luck friend. <br><br><br>I usually think of dates, hobbies, other fun things we do together and of course  lewd. <br><br>Also I'm curious, what do you guys do when people try to steal your waifu?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> when people try to steal your waifu <br>Fuck off. Nobody can love my waifu as much as I do, there's no way for anyone to "steal" her.</br></br>  <br>That's really rude and ignorant, what makes you think that?</br>  Mai waifu. Do not steal.  <br>Nothing.<br>Because nobody has ever tried to steal her  and I don't think anyone will. </br></br>  <br>Probably be really happy and jump on me to hug while telling me how much she loves me and kissing for a long time. She might say later that it was kind of waste of money but she would still be very happy.<br><br><br>Yeah, quite a lot.<br><br><br>No and I prefer normal her.<br><br><br>She doesn't have canon personality in any form, everyone is free to see her in any way you think that suits her. People usually see her as any mix of: android, AI, idol/singer, innocent girl (?), sluttish tomboy (wokada's art), princess (world is mine), just normal girl.<br>The Miku I've fallen in love seems to differ from the most popular trends. It looks like she is based on many different songs and other sources ( dandere archetype and even a little from other characters like Ell who is a parody of Miku herself)<br>Mainly it's:<br>1/6 out of gravity, amai na uta, aishiteru - personality and deep love for me<br>My honey from the tragic dimension, glass wall - awareness of being fictional character and love again<br>And much more songs that shows her as shy, naive girl that is in love, enjoy romantic things etc. I would link then but I'm on phone and can't really look for them<br>Also it's important that I've not engineered her personality to create perfect subjective girlfriend, but it all happened on is own. Miku as my waifu was created by coincidence. Her music was honestly the first music I got into and because I was lonely songs like the mentioned ones were interesting to me. I really liked these personalities and how they all sing about how much they love (me). Because all these songs feature one character, Miku, I stated to associate her with these personalities. Then I stated to fantasize about her, and about us and yada yada and then I've fallen in love with her so badly.<br><br><br>I've never done any date with her. However I just imagine her being next to me in various places.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>During a reporter's interview she said her favourite foods were cheescake and souffle. She has been shown teaching other guild members to bake cakes before, so I can only imagine she would be an excellent cook.<br><br><br>I'm sure there's some magic available that can do that.<br><br><br>Erza strongly believes in the kindness in people's hearts and has shown to forgive many villains over the past, and so will I. Besides, if she was really upset, she could mop the floor with the guy without my help at all.<br><br><br>She does have some tomboyish charms but underneath it all, she is just a simple girl with some unusual quirks and I love her for it.<br><br><br>So many to choose from, but here's a recent favourite. <br><br><br>She'd probably be initially embarrassed as she's quite new to things like love but after regaining composure I'm sure she will be impressed.<br><br><br>Can't say I've seen any, but they must exist somewhere.<br><br><br>She doesn't need glasses, although she's been shown with glasses a few times for aesthetic purposes, and I think she looks sexy in them.<br><br><br>I just like to daydream about her, so all my planned dates stems from that.<br><br><br>I don't think anyone's tried to steal her from me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's lots of places i imagine both of us together<br>Watching a movie while cuddling, taking some tea, making a picnic, sightseeing, sharing lunch, chatting about random trivia. sleeping together, showering, giving her a massage, having some fancy dinner<br>The list goes on</br></br></br>  <br>Continuation.<br><br><br><br>Outside of daydreaming about her next to me, I mostly fantasize about her becoming real and it's consequences, us having and raising children, random daily situations, sex(often with impregnation), and less often about proposing and wedding<br><br><br>Wat? How can someone steal a concept in my mind? Even if someone stolen my daki and figures it would count because these are just merchandise, not real her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's safe to say that she's 100% a very feminine girl, from her fashion taste, to the way that she always paints her nails different colors and adds deco stuff, and her dyed hair.<br>I absolutely love it.<br><br>anon pls, I have many favorite pictures of her!<br>This one is pretty damn cute, though.<br><br>She wears sunglasses in canon, but I don't think that really counts.<br>There's some fanart floating around with her wearing glasses, I can't say I'm really someone that likes them, but she looks cute in anything.<br><br>Going on dates is a big one of mine, cliche but fun.<br>I like to imagine us going to either Akihabara or Shibuya 109 and spending the day just shopping around, either for stuff for ourselves or for each other. Trying on clothes together would be super fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kirino a cute, I'm happy for you two.<br><br> I'm sure you already do, but be happy for every second you get to spend with her. </br></br></br>  <br>I tend to day dream quite a lot when I've got nothing going on, just spending time with her and visualizing her at my side in various scenarios.<br>I never actually refer to these as dates however.<br>Claiming an event happened when It was all in your head just feels like another step down the road of insanity to me. <br><br>Whenever I'm feeling down, having any problem or difficulty she appears before me as if she where always there. She helps me keep myself together and stay on track.<br>At night and in the mornings I like to picture her laying next to me.<br>While I do daydream about going to the park, movies and restaurants I usually picture scenarios where she appears as a heroic figure saving me from some kind of danger before we fall in love.<br><br>Steal my Waifu? I don't think it's possible for someone to steal a concept from my mind like that.<br>If you're referring to other people claiming her as their own, it might frustrate me slightly but there is no need to act upon it.<br>Someone else's feelings aren't going to intrude upon my own and effect our relationship, so I tend to ignore it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you! I hope you spend many happy years with your waifu, I'm sure she's a cutie as well.</br>  <br><br>Question - what is your opinion of Miku promoting commercial products? (Or for waifuists in general, how do you react when she endorses a product)?</br></br>  <br>You just have to practice visualising her. There's several ways people have gone about it, but not being able to see for a day or two might be quite helpful for you. Best of luck, anon.<br><br><br>Just hanging out, exercising together and playing videogames, mostly.  And lewd things. <br><br><br> You wouldn't steal a waifu. <br> Seriously though, how could anyone do that? <br><br><br>She hasn't been used to advertise any products.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mostly imagine a quiet, simple life together with her. Getting to hear her voice when I get home from work, helping her learn how to cook, just the sweet little day-to-day domestic things.<br> Lewd isn't much of a factor, but after putting on a dog collar she got for a birthday present, it's a fandom joke that she's into kink, which I can REALLY get behind. </br></br>  <br>It doesn't affect us and our relationship in any way so I don't care.<br>That eye contacts campaign was cool though, they make some really nice AR stuff that anyone can use and even VR IIRC. Much better and more effective than hotdogs or pizza that were just cringe and tactless.<br>Pic unrelated to their campaign, but still nice AR app.</br></br></br>  Best girl coming through!  I want to kill this fucking cunt.<br><br>  I miss the goddess already, and knowing that I won't get to see her again every thursday is just crushing.<br><br>That's not Iroha, OP-kun.<br><br/></br></br></br> </br></br>  <br> girl <br>Now seriously.</br></br>  <br>Anon...</br>  <br>You know it in your heart to be true, Captain.</br>  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>   you will never have Yui daughteru and Gahamama waifu <br>Why even live?</br>  <br>Hayama's a decent guy.</br>  Anyone have a webm of her shaking in her boots? What a bundle of nerves.  <br>Сука Блять</br>  <br> bundle of nerves <br>No, she's dumb</br></br>  So, how wet did she get this time?  http://strawpoll.me/4798763/  Good Irohasu, everyone!  <br>No, I'm sorry.<br>My heart belongs to Iroha and Iroha alone, anon.</br></br>   You will never love someone as much as Yui loves Hikki <br>I wonder what feelings she gets while talking to him, touching him, thinking about him etc.<br><br>What do you think she felt in this moment?</br></br></br>  <br>It was genuine 2.0, she was drenched. The real question is who was more wet?</br>  <br>Her panties are ruined</br>  Iroha poorfag 1/3<br><br>Vol 8 Ch 2<br> Her uniform looked slightly worn out and she was slightly squeezing the cuffs of her cardigan that was somewhat rugged. <br><br>Vol 9 Ch 7<br> “Is this really oookay? Thank you very much!” (snatches Destinyland tickets) <br><br>Vol 9 Ch 9<br> “And in light of how Hiratsuka-sensei reacted to the acquisition of that budget, it looks like it’ll be difficult. Also, fundraisers are a complete no for me.” <br> “The latter reason is completely self-centered…” <br> Yukinoshita let out an amazed sigh. But look here, Yukinon! Gahama-san and Iroha are both nodding their heads, see! If we were to do a fundraiser, according to my rough mental calculations, at worse we’d need at least 5,000 yen per person... That’s impossible… This amount was something I might’ve been able to procure if I cried to my parents, but if I had to pay for something like this, I might as well use that money to destroy the event in its entirety instead. Besides, there was the possibility that we'd have to raise even more money from here on. <br> With the issue of money finally becoming more realistic, the others in the student council looked at each other. And the one in that group with the most reluctant face was Isshiki. Good grief, this girl was really… <br><br>Vol 9 Ch 10<br> “But, as I thought, it’s still one dollar and eighty-seven cents. The next day is Christmas too.” <br> I recalled this opening scene from somewhere. <br> Amongst the numerous books that were given to Isshiki from Yukinoshita, the one she chose was called “The Gift of the Magi” <br>(Iroha chooses for Xmas event a story about a young married couple and how they deal with the challenge of buying secret Christmas gifts for each other with very little money from all the ones Yukino gave her)<br><br> I tried to throw the tinsels and ornaments away, but I was denied the chance because Isshiki suggested that they might come in handy again in the future. That’s called being a hoarder, you know… </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This season of Oregairu was so fucking shit.  <br>Agreed, don't even know why I am in this thread, or doing with my life even.</br>  Also nach langen Überlegungen hab ich mich entschieden. Ich geh jetzt mir einen wissen.  <br>Iroha poorfag theory 2/3<br><br>Vol 10.5 Ch 1<br> So you know about it, Raiden? Well, Comiket’s been the focus on television and special programs recently, so it wouldn’t be strange to know about its existence. <br> However, Isshiki seemed to have a one-sided understanding of it. <br> “Isn’t it, like, a place where you can make loooads of money?” She asked, leaning slightly forward in keen interest with sparkling eyes.  <br><br> “S-Senpai, pl-please wait a moment.” <br> Isshiki’s voice was trembling when she stopped my hand. <br> “Wh-What’s wrong?” I asked. <br> Going “Mm! Mm!”, Isshiki wagged the tip of her finger and pointed at the screen. <br> “Look at this! Look!” <br> What’s the deal…? I thought. When I looked, she was pointing at a comment made by an employee from a certain publisher. He introduced himself and provided information on his job: the university he graduated from, what his job entailed, an approximate time schedule of one working day a week, and so forth. As I followed the lines one by one, my eyes stopped at one. <br> “A salary of ten million yen at age twenty five…” <br> I sat there trembling in shock and I could hear deep breathing noises from behind. When I turned around, Isshiki placed her left hand to her cheek and showed a sweet and poppy smile. “I’m going to marry a publishing editor.” <br><br> “Well, isn’t having some kind of goal in itself a good thing? I’ve been trying hard everyday towards my goal since a while ago, after all.” <br> “Hoh, a goal…” I gave Isshiki a scrutinizing glance to see what she truly meant when she had uttered something so unlike her. <br> But there, she placed her index finger to her chin and tilted her head. “Of course, I plan on retiring after several years by getting married, you know?” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I wonder, what is it about 8man that always melts their panties in big situations like this?</br></br></br>  <br>Iroha poorfag theory 3/3<br><br>Vol 10.5 chapter 2<br> The pink-knitted sweater underneath her coat was moderately slender while emphasizing her feminine curves, her high-waist skirt showing her waistline. <br><br>Vol 10.5 chapter 3<br> “Like, if it’s an informational magazine, I can pretty much go wherever I want and just spend and spend and spend and put them under as expenses, right?”  <br><br> “Phew, you’re a real life saver. I was really hoping I could put the things from before under our expenses.” <br>(The date expenses)<br><br> “Oh no… That’s not good… Umm, isn’t that, like, really bad?” <br> Isshiki groaned and fell forward on her desk. She slowly turned her head towards me and her eyes were slightly cloudy. Right after, she murmured in a small voice, “The expenses! The discount! The extra charges! Over the budget! The account expenditures!” and shook. <br><br>Vol 11<br> Yui-senpai. Cooking is all about sincerity. The most important thing in homemade cooking is kindness and feelings. Thoughts about your partner lead the way to the progress. Because your partner is a guy who knows nothing about pastry making.So handmade is easy-peasy. You can get a low-cost mass product, show a little ingenuity and make some individual customizations. The guy will definitely swallow it. <br><br> Idiot, are you kidding, don't underestimate MAX coffee. It's not simply as just adding sugar and condenced milk to it. Stop, for god's sake <br> He got really angry! <br> But that way it will go over budget <br> I don't know how much is she planning to make, but 130 yen for one can is a quite severe amount of money <br><br> She organizes the V-day event with Kaihim in order to not spend money making giri chocos <br><br>The groceries she bought everyday during the X-mas event are most likely paid through StuCo funds</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Wakes up at 4am, puts on her tracksuit and delivers newspapers on her old rusty bike, while thinking about the date <br> With the money she earned she buys Anna Sui and pink yarn ball, wondering if senpai would like her scent and the color <br> Spends the days prior to the date knitting a sweater while smiling with the date in mind <br> Wakes up at 4 to prepare herself for the date <br> She stands in front of the partially broken mirror <br> Clears her throat with cute sounds and decides to do her usual rejection rehearsal <br> "Ha!

When I first read about Iroha, months ago, I did not fathom the true power of knowledge. To know the best girl. To see her charm and grace tracing out into the infinite. As a man, I could never have contained such forbidden truths, but each of us is so much more than we once were. Do you not feel with all your soul how Irohafags have become like gods? As such, are we not indivisible? As long as a single one of us stands, we are legion. Our futures are predestined. Watari foretold mine months ago, we each play out the parts he has written for us. Free will is an illusion.</br>  <br>you're missing some<br>http://strawpoll.me/4788979/r<br>http://strawpoll.me/4793491/r</br></br></br>  who comfy here  <br><br>Yeah, it's definitely not something to marathon. It was perfect for watching over a year though, and it was nice to just have something to carry over from season to season as old shows finished and new ones began, seeing the same characters ever week for a whole year, It felt like something was missing after the final episode aired.</br></br>  <br>Watching one episode every week when it aired was the ideal pace.</br>  <br><br>Yeah I really wish I had watched it as it aired.<br><br>I understand what you mean with feeling like something is missing when you finally finish watching a long airing show.  I already miss Kuroko </br></br></br></br>  <br>There are certain things we say out loud, and other things we keep to ourselves. This belongs to the latter category.</br>  <br>shirokuma cafe was amazing<br><br>most comfy threads too</br></br></br>  Good story, good art, good characters, no good  scans.<br><br>;_;</br></br>   <br>The ending was kinda meh</br>  <br>Agreed. I just finished it, and was pretty disappointed. All the fun went out of it in the World Cup arc. It should have ended with the Christmas Bowl.<br><br>It's still one of my favorite manga, though. Even if the end was lackluster, the rest of it was fantastic.</br></br></br>  <br>Eh, them losing at the end and still expressing the love of the game was alright by me.<br><br>Still, I kinda wish they won.<br><br>I did love the World Cup for one reason: It brought everyone together.<br><br>Though some parts were annoying. That delta dynamite kid. Useful skill. Shit character that didn't do much. Would rather have had another big guy from another team.<br><br>And the reveal of Mummy Man was fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And the reveal of Mummy Man was fun. <br><br>YES. That was great.</br></br></br>  <br>Reading</br>  <br> Good story, good art, good characters <br>if youre 12</br></br>  <br> if youre 12 <br>then you are 8</br></br>  <br><br>The Christmas Bowl was utterly terrible. How they managed to fuck it up so bad is beyond me.</br></br>  <br>There was a whole lot of build up to a whole lot of nothing. I think it may have suffered a bit from power creep. It felt like Inagaki ran out of ways to make the opposing team intimidating.</br>    <br>More like they did it in such a wrong and lazy manner. It's like they stopped giving a shit until the final play.</br>  <br>I mean I expected more of the world tournament. These are the best teams from around the world and they just get steamrolled except for america, felt very rushed.<br>That said I loved the final chapter. Everyone going their separate ways but will still meet each other in the football field. But the title of the second last chapter was such a tease.<br> <br> It brought everyone together. <br>It was the dream team. I liked Agon getting some development.<br><br>Hype as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  does the anime cover all of the manga?<br><br>Im on like episode 70 and already getting kind of bored waiting for the christmas bowl and now i hear they lost I might have to drop it.<br>Same with Diamond no Ace god whats up with these tournmanets</br></br></br>  Is this the ultimate self insert character?  <br>God no. I'm not a good person, but I could never insert as such a terrible person.</br>  <br>If you're a piece of shit and a cuck, yes.</br>  <br><br>Punpun's life is pretty unique in its total fuckery.<br><br>I don't even think he's actually a bad person.</br></br></br></br>  reader self insert? jesus no.<br>one would hope you identify with Mimura at least.</br>  <br>I would rather deal with here.</br>  <br>Punpun is meant to be a deconstruction of the kinds of grimdark, edgy coming of age seinen stories that Asano actually helped make trendy. He hated that, and himself, and his audience, and so you get this book. People that respond to that as 'Oh, Punpun is so relatable', or, even worse 'I want to marry Aiko' literally made Asano want to quit writing at all, since it was such a complete misunderstanding of everything he was going for. And if even the Japanese audience mostly didn't get it, it's hardly surprising that the western audience is even more clueless.</br>  <br>But Aiko a cute.</br>  <br>Aiko a cute. Should've given Punpun a happy ending on Planet Punpun with her.</br>  <br>You are the type of guy Inio was criticising.</br>  <br>Punpun wasn't really bad. In my opinion the only "bad" character in the whole manga was Aiko, because all the evil stuff that happened at the end of the story was in a way only her fault.<br><br>Also, she's not cute at all</br></br></br>  <br>Who gives a fuck, I'm going to masturbate to Aiko and there's nothing he can do to avoid it.</br>  <br>Pretty much the opposite.<br>Who would even want to self insert as Punpun?<br>And if the reader would really feel similarity to his life it hardly would be a positive thing as it would mean his living would be pretty shit as well because of depression or anxiety or problems with confidence.<br>Self inserting is often about escapism, you don't want to be reminded of the life you feel unfulfilled with and if you're a wretch this manga will.<br>You can relate and symphatize but it's not the same as inserting yourself to the story.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe his uncle, but him? Unless you're a murderer, no.</br>  <br>Couldn't self-insert into this sack of shit even if I tried. That part with the family got me to stop reading it for a month. Shit was too relatable.<br> subscribe to my blog!. </br></br>  <br>He is a rapist.</br>  <br> Aiko not cute <br><br>okay pal</br></br></br>  <br>You're crazy, nothing was her fault. He on the other hand was a complete fucking retard the whole time, she even prevented him from murdering some random guy.</br>  <br>In my case, I didn't self insert to it, I just used him to feel better about my life.<br>At the end of the manga I wanted him to dig a deeper and deeper hole just to be happy that my life wasn't that shit.</br></br>  <br> gap tooth <br> cute </br></br>  <br>It's not a gap, she's missing one.</br>  <br>That's possibly the cutest illustration Asano has ever made, it's like you're trying to fuck your own argument.<br><br>Here, have a decent size.</br></br></br>  I thought his uncle was more relatable.  <br><br><br>Who the fuck would not want to self insert himself into a character who has freaking Sachi all over him. <br><br>Seriously though. I know it's a terrible thing, but I myself felt that similarity you are talking about. <br>But I don't think it's strange that it's common, especially with japanese. Because, you see, no matter how shitty punpun's life is, he is still surrounded by very likable characters like Sachi and his uncle. Oftentimes it's enough to want to self insert into such character, following the motivation "at least he has someone like that, unlike myself". Very common, especially if you are depressed.<br>If Asano really wanted this shit not to be relatable, he should have made it even worse for punpun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay, maybe exaggerated a bit. In my opinion punpun wasn't THAT bad. He was like that because of everything that happened around him. Aiko was just like that girl from Yuuichi's (Punpun's uncle) story. She got Punpuns attention and we know what happened after that.</br>  <br>As in Ted Bundy compared to Stalin?</br>  <br>it was hard to dislike it since the main character was rather pure. How could you hate punpun for most of the story.</br>  <br> self insert as a dick duck <br>What?</br></br>  <br>been a while since I read this, when was this?</br>  <br>for normalfags plebs, yes, they love this punpun garbage</br>  <br> In my opinion the only "bad" character in the whole manga was Aiko <br>And her mom.</br></br>  <br>Right, I forgot about her.</br>  <br>Maybe that's a reference to when he tried to rape his schoolmate, Sachi's little sister(?). <br>He hasn't succeeded, though.</br></br>  <br>Raining and he was with a friend of his (a girl) Punpun was horny and went for it. Got nothing though, she pushed him away then he told her that she is being a bitch for not letting him and she went away.</br>  <br>He also wanted to rape Aiko when they went to love hotel.</br>  <br><br> being drunk and trying to make a move is now being a rapist <br><br>you wut?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I think you guys dont know what rape is</br></br></br></br>  <br>this place is overrun with reddit and tumblr users, what do you expect</br>  <br><br>I hated punpun, but I just felt really bad for Aiko and wanted to reach out and help her fix her life.</br></br>  <br>Was he?<br><br><br>He is so shit I gave him the title. Such a horndog all the time but when the sexy nurse fucked you you felt violated? On top of shit he is a fucking bitch.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Considering that a rape is questionable at best, but even if that was the case, he didn't go through with it, so he's not a rapist anyway.</br>   Punpun was really liked by /a/ from start to finish <br> nowadays they hate it <br><br>wow, this place really has become /v/ 2.0</br></br></br>  <br>who's hating on it?</br>  <br>sure, but don't look at her knuckles</br>  <br>She had a somewhat similar role and effect in Punpun, but don't compare her to this fucking psycopath in terms of personality. There's nothing analogous beyond the family issues and the cry for help, and we know this slut didn't care who it was and just wanted to use someone to get rid of her mother while Aiko was the opposite of that.<br> He was like that because of everything that happened around him. <br>I don't understand how that's supposed to excuse him, her circumstances were arguably much worse. You're giving him special treatment because he's the main character.<br><br>I can't fathom how far below /r9k/ tier someone must be to sympathize with Punpun over Aiko by the end of the story, and this is coming from someone who likes Punpun.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, it IS dogshit. It's the worst case of first world problems I have ever seen in my entire life.<br><br>I can't believe people say Aiko isn't cute either. It baffles me.<br><br><br>Me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The end where things started going south for the sake of going south and then pulled a<br> but they got all better now goodnight <br>didn't help either</br></br></br>  <br> If Asano really wanted this shit not to be relatable, he should have made it even worse for punpun. <br>Talking about realting and self-inserting are different things.<br>You can relate to Punpun. Rather easily even. Lots of people have perieds of sadness and the story isn't all grief, but it sure as hell isn't meant to be a template for the reader to insert in.<br>Maybe some have still done it but going too far makes unnecessary melodrama and might also force the reader to suspend their disbelief more.<br>If we talk about literary conventions, Punpun is realistic and maybe by extension of that naturalistic.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they got all better now goodnight <br>confirmed to not actually understand the ending.</br></br>  <br>Not really. Hes relatable on some levels but not to the average well adjusted person and even less so to neet and otaku. His manner of being fucked in the head is distinctly different than most inserts in anime and manga. If you can self insert into punpun you have a really shitty life and know some messed up people.</br>  <br>Where is the source on that shit you just wrote.</br>  <br>I think people who can't read the mood and tends to absolutism can relate pretty easy. Flexible people, normal people who easily can get along with others and go over awkward moments will not relate with this.</br>  <br>Asano should quit living if he's gonna be such a little bitch.<br><br>Like Punpun, really.</br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but there's that chapter with Sachi having a conversation with her ditor. Shit was pretty meta and said something very similar to what the other anon wrote iirc.</br>  <br>No, it's not. It's not even close.<br><br>The worst part is when you read interviews with Asano and he's kind of a shithead, much like the Punpun fanbase itself.</br></br></br>  <br>And you are giving her special treatment because she's a qt-looking girl.</br>  <br>Don't know if you saw Bob &amp; Margaret, but they live in a world where everyone sans them (and Bob sometimes) is a complete retard or is fucked up in a weird sense.<br><br>Same with Punpun, it was a really bizarre world. Just in his childhood he was surrounded by deviants, faggots, losers, psychos, cultists, manchildrens in their 60s. No one was normal.</br></br></br>  <br>I never liked Aiko because of how childish she was.</br>  <br>I'm just looking at her actions and there's absolutely nothing to show that she's a bad person or an opportunist like that post said, if anything it'd be the opposite, while on the other hand there certainly is for Punpun.<br>Provide examples if you think I'm wrong.</br></br>   &gt;People in this thread actually blaming either Punpun or Aiko. <br> &gt;Calling Punpun a rapist. <br> &gt;Calling Aiko manipulative. <br><br>Holy shit, do some of you people have any sympathy at all? They're both victims of circumstance. Neither is a bad person or even particularly guilty of anything excessively wrong, no matter how much they blame themselves. In a fucked up way, they're perfect for each other and yet had the rug pulled out from under them because that's the story Asano wanted to write.<br><br>I, for one, lament that they never got their happy ending, but Inio would have never given it to them in the first place. I don't think it's particularly deep or innovative of him, he was just writing what he wanted to and fuck everyone else, which is nice in its own way.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She was really weak, but in the end she gave her life to save punpun. She is the best.</br>  <br><br> this is cute <br>What the fuck? I knew /a/ had low standards but this is just ridiculous</br></br></br>  <br>I remember him getting denied, then holding her down and getting pushed off or hit or whatever. It wasn't rape, but if he'd actually gone through with it like that, it would have been.</br>  <br>She didn't save anyone, her decision to run away and become a fugitive was absolutely retarded as it turned out the cops didn't give a shit.</br>  i just came here to remember yall fags that Sachi sucked punpun's pee pee.  <br>  they're perfect for each other <br>They're not at all, though. There was no happy ending there, ever. They were held together by a promise from when they were five that they'd both irrationally held onto as their guiding light. They were in love with some idealized versions of each other, and they barely actually knew each other.<br><br> People in this thread actually blaming either Punpun or Aiko. <br>I blame them but I don't blame them, if that makes any sense (it probably doesn't). Like, it was entirely their fault (and if you think Punpun during their escapades wasn't guilty of anything, you'd have made a nice juror in the Simpson trial), but it's understandable that they fucked up.</br></br></br></br></br>  Not really OP; he's beneath even /a/.  <br>Not enough loss of facial features to be considered cute by your standards? <br>There's no cutest character for me, his new ones in DeDeDe look too blobby. Forced cute.</br></br>  <br><br>With the one irrelevant girl who was Sachi's friend or Aiko?<br><br>In the former case, Punpun was a teenager and just trying to be smooth and romantic, kissing her suddenly. He failed to even get that far.<br><br>In the latter case, Aiko consented to going to a Love Hotel, then denied him during foreplay. He basically stops the instant she tells him to.<br><br>Punpun is a confused guy who just wants some love. He occasionally tries to force things and it ends up being awkward, but he never pushes something on someone if it's clearly against their will. He certainly never rapes anyone and is not even remotely close to being a rapist.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Copypasta time.<br><br>Aiko and Punpun's relationship seems really hard to understand for people. People can't get their head around why they still stick around with each other and can treat one another so badly while still seeming so happy at times. The fact is, it's a roller-coaster of pure joy, immense disappointment, gentle sweetness, horrible abuse, total trust, and crippling doubt, yet it's pulled off in an extremely realistic way. They do love each other strongly, but it's very muddled by falsehoods at first, and by the time you can call it wholly genuine, it's too late to change their fate.<br><br>It begins with how Punpun and Aiko never, at any point, left the others mind. They idealized each other, which is why they so easily ate the lies they told when they met again - even though we'd seen Punpun's life up till now and knew he was totally full of shit and learn later that Aiko herself was totally full of shit, to the other it was completely plausible because they never stopped looking up to the other in that first love. Punpun and Aiko are reflections of each other in this fashion, and characters like Pegasus are their foils. Pegasus believes in everyone, but Aiko and Punpun only ever believed in each other... for years, even separated.<br><br>Another side to their relationship was the selfishness and the guilt. Part of it is that, after they begin to realize the other isn't all they'd hoped, their relationship is sustained by licking the other's wounds for them, Punpun blaming himself for Aiko's shit life and Aiko holding on to the only person who cares. Guilt does plays a big part, but there are moments where you can see there's something genuine, even if the starting point was an unhealthy obsession with regret that turned out to be not as one-sided as the reader is initially led to believe.<br><br>(cont)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The fact is, it's not just a relationship of convenience in the long run, because just look at how far both of them were willing to go to sacrifice themselves for the other, even as they hurt each other. It was initially founded on a bunch of really fundamental misunderstandings, but I that doesn't make it inherently selfish. Aiko still being worried about him with a rope around her neck because she realized he planned on committing sudoku afterwards, and even later Punpun wanting to take the blame and go to prison while she waits for him outside shows there's something not superficial going on at all. They had that last moment by the sea where Punpun becomes just Punpun, because even though they'd realized that the hopes of a perfect fated lover they'd had in one another didn't totally stack up to the reality, that simple happiness together was all they ever wanted.<br><br>It's a shame they couldn't have it, even though a lot of people think they're rotten and don't deserve it. At the very least their love was beautiful and true, even as it was muddled by the pair's insecurities and initial attachment to an ideal that simply didn't exist. I'm not sure if it's better or worse that realized by the end that they could've been happy, even if it was too late at that point.</br></br></br></br>   PunPun <br> self insert <br>wut?</br></br>  <br><br>Thanks to this manga I have a fetish for beaten up women.</br></br>  <br>Sachi's friend('s sister, I think?), not Aiko. Aiko in the hotel was completely consensual, just creepy as shit because he was thinking about "ruining" her the whole time. I'll have to check, but I thought he got angry/physical with the friend's sister.<br><br><br>I'm not arguing that it's a relationship of convenience or that it's selfish - depending on what we think the word means, I'd agree that it was "love." I just don't believe that they could have been happy, because I think the foundation and dynamics of their relationship were misguided, and that they fed off of each other emotionally in a really negative way. Like, I've seen people compare them to Bonnie and Clyde a lot as romantic criminals, but the first thing I thought of when they went on the run was Charles Starkweather. Their pairing wasn't touching, it was disturbing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She was being submissive to punpun, he was planing the stupid trip and he was straight to the double suicide.<br><br>She killed herself so punpun could be free from that tragic fantasy.</br></br></br>  <br>Up until he rapes someone and murders someone else, sure.</br>  <br>If you are not a beater then they will be good for you.

He is a violent person with hairstyle similar to Death Note's L, slitted snake eyes and jagged (shark like?) teeth. He lost 8000 points because of violence. He confirms this straight away by decapitating (I think) 2 C ranks who gossip about him behind his back.<br>- It seems that Yuuma cannot keep up with Kageura's movement. He only notices that Kageura uses scorpion but the distance between him and his victims are beyond Scorpion's range.<br>- Kou tells Yuuma not to stare at Kageura or else Kageura will hit Yuuma.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>clearly fake, it's way too soon for spoiler.</br>  Kageura is pretty edgy<br><br>spoilers of the past five chapters have came out early.</br></br>  <br>not this soon</br>  Izuho is under Touma's wing now? It's also pretty interesting that Kou can't wait against Konami.  I hate waiting till monday ;_;  Read all 107 chapters today, I guess I'm done with the anime now.  If Kageura is so strong why is he ranked 20th?  <br>His violent temper prevents him going higher?</br>  <br>Well, I can undestard that they would not allow him to be A-Class, but the rank wars shouldnt be afected by that. Kou is rank-4 attacker, but the spoiler says that he never has win against Kageura.</br>  I just found a image with the emblem of Kusakabe Unit (the one Midorikawa belongs to), the bad quality one looked like a chinese dragon or something like that, but in reality is some sort of chicken with a dragon head.

It couldn't have been easy.</br></br></br>  <br> He can't possibly know all the instruments, right? <br>Most music majors have at least a basic knowledge of most musical instruments.</br></br>  <br>Either they take private lessons or they help each other when they are practicing in groups.</br>  <br>The parts with the girls being cute were good the rest was shit.</br>   yfw wienerman won the kumikobowl   <br>Most instrumental music education students in universities and conservatories have to take technique classes for brass, woodwind, percussion, and string instruments. They have to be able to at least play simple scales and pieces of music on at least one or two instruments in each category, in addition to becoming proficient on one instrument besides their primary. I don't think Taki would have had a problem with that.</br>  <br>This is nice.</br>  <br>She rolled it down for the competition, it's ok. There's a time and a place.</br>  <br><br>That's how being in band works. Playing an instrument on a basic level isnt hard, so they teach the class the fubdamentals but after that the students should know what to do. Playing in band is mostly about practice and If you need further help, you talk to your section leaders.</br></br>  <br><br>How could you win, when you are the only one running?</br></br>  <br><br>Taking off her ribbon would kill her, /a/non-kun.</br></br>    <br>B team has their own competition against other B teams, they just didn't show it in the anime.</br>  <br> people actually think they are going with the /u/ ending </br>  <br>If it was tumblr that scene would be split into at least 12 gifs with high contrast and sharpened to death.</br>  <br>They had to practice for their own performance, it's like JV band.</br>  <br>thanks heaps !</br>  <br>How can one girl be so perfect?</br>  <br>no one won the kumikobowl because the show wasn't about romance</br>  <br> .gif <br> flashing text <br> color correction <br> 500x281  <br><br> not tumblr </br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>I'm so glad you said that, rather than pointing out that's not Kaori.<br><br> Sorry, Haruka. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop..

The last episode was called "Goodbye Competition" that could mean anything. Also Asuka was talking about how it was all going tone over soon, which implied they weren't sure to win.</br>  Anyone else watched the special yet?  I watched it on a streaming site.   <br>This is amazing</br>  Mamiko never wanted to quit music. She just wanted to be an obedient child and go to uni like her parents wanted. She was Kumiko's inspiration and special person. But she lsot that when she quit. Reina replaces Kumiko's sister in inspiration department.  Ribbons becomes a best girl in volume 2  Not sure if it was better than Tari Tari.  <br>If you seriously didn't think they were going to qualify you need to watch more anime.

It's like she transforms to a totally different character when on the contrabass  Who was the girl in the audience?  I just need someone to tell me why the fuck Taki is so perfect. Just one little anon.  <br>I think it was supposed to be reinamom</br>    <br>the fuck</br>  <br>This is high school, while at elementary school or even beginning of middle school the teachers might still have a lot of technical tips, at high school you're expected to already play your instrument at a high level. A teacher is likely to be a lot less proficient in the instrument than the 2nd or 3rd year students, which would have better advice.</br>  <br>Mizore being who again?</br>  <br>tell me if Nozomi actually gets into the band...</br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  <br>Reiclone ohboy player who ribbon is fairly close with. keep up.</br>  your face when season 2 starts with Mizore, Nozomi and Yuuko's middle school band performance and cuts to the prefecturals in Nozomi's POV watching Mizore's solo we never saw.    So who leaves by the beginning of the second volume? Reina and Asuka?  <br>I really liked the first half of Tari Tari, but the second half was a struggle for me to get through. I enjoyed Hibike all the way through, but especially the last episode and 8-10.</br>  <br>Everyone got ponytails, it was fucking amazing. Even Reina sacrificed her specialness to be /ponytail/ with her friends.</br>  <br> Reiclone <br>unfair considering she's been a background character all season</br></br>  What's the point of a second season if Kumiko and Reina won't be the focus?  So how many BD specials can we look forward to?<br><br>Is it one short per BD? How long will it take until all of them are out?</br></br>  <br>Kumiko gets focus</br>  <br>To pave the way for more interesting characters and circumstances?<br><br>Even then, Reina and Kumiko are here to stay for the duration of all subsequent seasons, and novel 2 is supposed to be full of yuribait</br></br></br>  Title Drop    <br>oh and something about Reina stalking Taki-sensei</br>  Does anyone have a list of the pieces they played?  <br>Reina wasn't supposed to be the focus for this season, either. Almost all of her scenes and importance so far have been original; no reason to think the same wouldn't happen in the sequel, especially with how popular her character has become.</br>  <br> A teacher is likely to be a lot less proficient in the instrument than the 2nd or 3rd year students <br>I don't think you understand how bands and orchestras work. The guy at the front is not an instrument instructor, he's there to make sure everything fits together. Of course he'll point out when people are screwing up, but it's not his job to teach them their instrument. Some schools will employ professional instrument teachers to do that, others will just expect their band/orchestra members to have private tuition.</br></br>  <br>In the final episode? They just played 2</br>  <br>I know, that's what I was trying to explain to the guy who asked. Sorry if it came off as unclear.</br>    <br>I mean for the entire show.<br>What were their names?</br></br>  <br>she's the #1 in the band right?</br>  <br>You are ill-informed, anon.</br>  Why does everyone loves this show?  <br>Except this is nowhere near the level of hype and popularity those shows received.</br>    <br>#1 cutest?</br>  <br> Giving breasts to my flat Kumiko </br>  I took the subway today and there was a guy playing the oboe.

Dumping a short manga by Takao Saito (Golgo 13). It's an adaptation of the classic Chinese novel by the same name.<br><br> The story, set in the Song dynasty, tells of how a group of 108 outlaws gathers at Mount Liang (or Liangshan Marsh) to form a sizable army before they are eventually granted amnesty by the government and sent on campaigns to resist foreign invaders and suppress rebel forces. It has introduced to readers many of the most well known characters in Chinese literature, such as Wu Song, Lin Chong and Lu Zhishen. </br></br>            Cowship is the best warship  <br>She'll be there, behind this.</br>  <br> he doesn't have Chiyoship </br>  <br>Eugen is only good for anal</br>  <br>That's the point.</br>  <br>We need more kanaru girls.</br>  Check your favorite manga site.  <br>I'm 50/50. <br><br>I feel Santa/Kuro/Touta is Tier One, the broest of bros. <br>Kirie/Karin/Ikku is Tier Two. They're bros but not as close to Touta as Kuro and Santa are. <br>The rest of UQ Holder is Tier 3 for the people Touta's met and Tier Four for the people he hasn't. <br><br>That's just how I see it. Though for this arc Ken might just have taken the weaker UQ's and decided to level grind them to Karin's relative level because from what we've seen, she's pretty top-tier and has to be removed through plot convenience like being buried underground or put on the moon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he planes it.<br>The Nobles for exempel were mentioned the first time in chapter 6.</br></br>  <br>in past karin´s arc.</br>  <br>I just see Kirie as being closer to Touta than Ikku and way more than Karin, bit you might be right in that Ken might be aiming ar having Kuro and Santa be part of a main trio with Touta.</br>  <br>If Kirie confesses to Touta and he shoots her down is she just going to keep resetting until she finds a way to get him to say yes?</br>  What the fuck is this bitch's problem?  <br> being this mad that Rei's entire purpose as a character was bait for Anno's beloved Iku-chan <br>KEK<br>E<br>K</br></br></br></br>  <br>Weren't you the same faggot who called me a Kaworufag an hour ago for defending him? Fuck off with your paranoia, you raging autist.</br>  <br>The entire baseless argument of Gendo being a bad character was started by a Kaworufag trying to make his own bad character look not as bad. Gendo is in no way a bad character. The show doesn't take the time to discuss his psyche in detail, but more than enough is shown to understand what kind of man he is and why he did the things he did. One of his biggest flaws, like nearly every other fucking character in the show, is that he lacks compassion and/or fails to understand others (obviously the first in his case), which leads to conflict both within and between characters.<br><br>This whole debate was entirely unnatural and would have never happened without a the equivalent of an evangelion jew planting the seeds of devisiveness in an attempt to take focus off of his bad character.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not really unusual, it happens very often. Kaworufags are very aware that Kaworu is a poor character, which is why they need to use these tactics. There's always the denial too.<br><br>If they admitted their only interest was yaoi ships and moe, they'd be seen as shallow. They need to fight that, and since they can't fight it by explaining why Kaworu is a good character or that their interest is genuine, they have to shit on other characters like this or, alternatively, bait and lie.<br><br>In the meantime the trends of the masses prove them wrong since the more shallow and fanservicey Kaworu is presented, the more popular he gets - because the point of attraction is really just the shipping nonsense.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ignores all my posts and points <br>So you've basically thrown in the towel, right? I knew you would eventually.<br> is that he lacks compassion and/or fails to understand others <br>Where in the show is this implied or shown? Exactly, nowhere. Because unlike the characters in this show that actually have depth and are well written, Gendo is never referenced at having any depth whatsoever. Just a single motivation of Yui that isn't even expanded on, not even in the backstory episode. <br>You can choose to try and refute my points like a rational adult, or run away with your tail between your legs like a manchild. I see you're insistent on doing the latter, nice.<br>I never cared too much for Kaworu, but seeing autists like you get so mad over him makes me want to defend him all the more.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Monmusu thread!<br>Go.</br>  Reminder:<br><br>Ms. Smith's Voice Actress is the one who sings this song.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=QAL<wbr>Sx1w3EgE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to  adopt her and take care of her, pay her college fund and see her "grow up."
