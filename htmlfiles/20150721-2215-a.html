Why am I such a retarded and it's so freaking hard to produce? I can read simple texts just fine, but I neglected speaking and writing practice.  マイバットイスゾビッグ  <br>read out loud!</br>  <br>漢字でおｋ</br>   sick for 2 weeks and taking a break from learning in that time <br> go back to learn kanji  <br> having trouble with reading some katakana <br><br>I learn them and think I won't forget them, but if I take a break for whatever reason I need to relearn them.<br><br>Any idea how I could force them into my fucking brain so hard they they never get lost again?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I can't learn Japanese  <br>pretty much have to keep at it, after a while you won't forget</br>  <br>I think that playing a bit of an old Final Fantasy, such as IV or some other JRPG can help you with that.</br>  <br>If you can read and understand spoken Japanese just fine then speaking and writing should come progressively without much problem as long as you practice. Go on lang8 and write anything you'd like. It's really easy to make "friends" there, get their skype and type away. This  is also a good advice, though I'd argue that it's still far less effective than directly speaking to someone while forming your own thoughts. Unless you're really fucked up in the head making a Japanese friend with whom you could speak via skype doesn't sound too hard. There are plenty of people asking for English &lt;-&gt; Japanese exchanges.</br>  <br>My best friend wants me to learn japanese, because she fucking loves japan and japanese things and I guess saying japanese words to me sometimes.<br><br>I like giving in to her demands so<br><br>Where would I even start casually learning how to read and write daily japanese words and phrases for practical use?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nothing happens. what am i doing wrong.</br>  <br>I was thinking of using iTalki or something, but I'm pretty much broken. I met some Japanese people on Japan Guide that were willing to talk, but they got bored of me really fast. Probably because my Japanese is shit.</br>  <br>you can't learn Japanese give up it's impossible</br>  <br>I don't know, by reading the guide you just replied to perhaps?</br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>that sounds like a good idea, I should try that as well<br><br>sometimes when I'm watching stuff, I'll just repeat sentences here and there and try to emulate the annunciations as close as possible</br></br></br>  <br>Give lang8 a try then. It's free and there's tons of girls there willing to learn western languages and flirt and stuff.</br>  <br> My best friend <br> because she fucking loves japan and japanese things <br> she <br> and I guess saying japanese words to me sometimes <br> I like giving in to her demands so <br>This post was awful.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The guide is really long, and half of it is in a different language.</br>  <br> I like giving in to her demands so <br><br>kekked internally</br></br></br>  <br>Fucking die already.</br>  Hey guys, how do I learn Hiragana?  <br>You can't.</br>  <br>with your eyeballs.</br>  <br>Damn you OP.

You're the one intruding.</br>  <br> my best friend  <br> friend </br></br>  <br>This is /djt/ There are plenty of crossboarders here because this is the place to discuss the Japanese language.</br>  <br>Feels pretty good to be beyond fluent.</br>  <br><br>This isn't on /a/. This isn't on 4chan. This isn't on the internet. This is on Japanese soil and if you don't leave immediately it will be seen as an act of war.</br></br>  <br>You might want to go to /int/ m8</br>  <br> ッ <br>\(ッ)/<br><br>I bet none of you ever noticed that</br></br></br></br>  <br> practical use <br>I don't think DJT knows anything about that.<br><br>People don't come here just to learn phrases and "practical use" shit.<br>This thread is pretty much composed of nothing but people who want to learn the language in full, so this probably isn't a good place to ask that question.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't change the fact that the thread is by /a/ and for /a/ and that this thread is one of the most cancerous threads on the board because of all the crossboarding. /int/ has a thread too, and there are other forums available. If you aren't an /a/ browser, I'm not sure why you'd stay on /djt/ once you have the resources in the OP.</br>  <br> This thread is pretty much composed of nothing but people who want to learn the language in full <br><br>No, it's full of people who want to read obscure, pretentious fiction. Not many people here care about ever developing their conversational skills.</br></br></br>  <br>These threads should have always been on /jp/ as they're the only board that cares about untranslated media. It would have kept the crossboarding to a minimum and the discussions would be of much higher quality. <br><br>If there were so many /a/ regulars in these threads then there would be much more anime and manga discussion. Most of the discussion of Japanese media here is confined to porn manga and VNs.</br></br></br>  <br>well I didn't really mean "full" as in having all the skills<br><br>I just meant that people here aren't learning only parts of the language so they can pick up common phrases in anime/manga<br>we are learning the full language. Even if we don't care to build conversation skills</br></br></br></br>  <br> the discussions would be of much higher quality <br> /jp/ </br></br>  <br> If there were so many /a/ regulars in these threads then there would be much more anime and manga discussion. Most of the discussion of Japanese media here is confined to porn manga and VNs. <br>That's just because watching raw anime is much more difficult than reading raw VNs. People aren't going to be doing the former until they have studied for 2+ years and have likely left this thread. It is also because anime is already subbed so you don't NEED to learn japanese to watch anime. But neither of those mean that the people here aren't watching anime as well.</br></br>  <br>If you are serious, you can learn it in less than a week. I learned Hiragana and Katakana in 5 days. <br><br>Just sit down at your desk with a Hiragana chart by your side and start writing down as many symbols as you want. I started with 25 a day, but you can do 10 or 15.<br><br>あ　い　う　え　お<br>か　き　く　け　こ<br>さ　し　す　せ　そ<br><br>Just write down those fuckers until you are tired. <br><br>Then go to http://realkana.com/hiragana/ and train your recognition. Repeat that and you should be fine. It's boring, but I don't see other way to do it that fast.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Thinking of moving to Japan for a while in order to learn by immersion. Anyone have any tips for me before I go?  How am I supposed to learn Katakana?<br>I already learned Hiragana, but why do I need a whole nother alphabet of bullshit.</br>  <br>ugh</br>  <br>Don't, skip it and learn romanji for katakana words.</br>  <br>How am I supposed to learn upper case?<br>I already learned lower case, but why do I need a whole nother alphabet of bullshit.=</br></br>  <br><br>This. Don't listen to the trolls that tell you that you need to learn it. They're just pissed they went and did it and it was for nothing.<br><br>Mostly anything that needs Katakana is actually written in English anyways.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You need to actually learn, even if you're there. Just being there alone (or even worse, being there and only conversing with other foreigners) won't teach you anything.</br>  How much of Tae Kims guide do i need to read before i start reading literature and jap media? I realy hate reading grammar so i just want to start reading manga and watching anime  To all the regulars of /djt/, I never thought I'd say this since you guys are pretentious faggots constantly arguing about learning methods but, I love you guys.<br><br>Summer is rough.</br></br>  <br>It depends on how much you want to suffer. I recommend at least the basic section. Watching anime will take some time, but you can start with Yotsubato right now. Just download the free reading pack for Vol. 1 and give it a try.</br>  <br>Fuck off im doing my reps<br> Love you too /a/non now get back to study </br></br>  <br><br><br>I try to repeat the pronunciation for some example sentences of Core 6k. I'm going try to do that more. <br><br>As for Lang8, I tried using it. I guess I'll publish more posts over there. People usually correct stuff, but never had luck of finding a language partner.</br></br></br></br></br>  Did anyone use or is currently using Tobira? I'm liking that shit, but when I get at the practice sections, the book asks stuff about the text like:<br><br>袋入りラーメンとカップラーメンとどちらの方がよく食べられていますか。そ<wbr>れはどうしてですか。<br><br>And I keep staring at the page like a moron. If I open notepad (because I can't handwrite) and spend a couple minutes, I can come up with an answer, but most of the times, it is utter shit.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Try to correct people as well (Japanese people that is), that can be a good conversation starter. Set a nice profile picture and be friendly, act nice, even if it feels out of character.</br>  Has anyone here tried this deck http://japaneselevelup.com/japanese<wbr>-level-up-rtk-mod-anki-deck/ and if yes was it worth it / good?<br>I like the concept but so far it's been slightly frustrating, showing words with only half of their Kanji and letting you guess what's missing is kinda odd. If only there was furigana it'd be fine but there's not, and I don't really feel like adding that to 1900 cards.</br></wbr>  <br>Well, I'm kind of a leech over there I'd say. I get corrected everytime, but very rarely correct stuff for people. I'll try doing that more. Thanks for the tip.</br>  <br>Do you ever get contradicting corrections?</br>  <br>Well, I don't know if that's contradicting, but there were times when two people corrected a particular mistake differently, or one considered something all right, while other corrected it.</br>  you can't be serious who the fuck typed this  <br>Someone smarter than you, apparently.</br>  <br><br>When I first started I never corrected anyone's post because I was too scared. Now it's sort of working out pretty well.</br></br>  You are now tasked with translating Spurdo pictures into Japanese. How do you go about it?  <br>ファッグ</br>  <br>Looks like a transcription error. CoRくん probably didn't see this while fixing typos, since it's in the new deck (yours is outdated). The sentence has "映画" instead of "英語" in the original entry in the DoJG. Doesn't really take long to fix and there aren't a ton of typos like this, so it's not really a big deal.<br><br> Also, reminder that you're supposed to read the entries in the DoJG as you go through new cards in the deck. The deck and reference page are meant for reviewing, not learning. </br></br></br>  <br>I also don't correct people too much because I learned English playing video games and my grammar is terrible. I feel more comfortable correcting Portuguese, but there's not that much people learning it over there.</br>  <br>挨拶はきちんと<br>よく寝て、よく食べる<br>悩んだら相談！</br></br></br>  <br>x that much<br>* that many</br></br>  <br>DJT is for people who have grew out of /a/, it's basically its own board.</br>  <br>see, that's how shitty my English is.</br>  <br>nah man your english looks like a native wrote it. a lot of native speakers make mistakes way worse than that. some of them don't even use capitalization!</br>   i couldnt request a simple line or three translated into english and romaji in this thread could i?   <br>no, you can't. fuck off</br>  <br>This is actually a pretty good idea, here is a test for beginners</br>  <br>Well, thank you. I'm trying to improve. Even more now that I'm learning Japanese through it.</br>  <br>And a more advanced one.</br>  <br>Maybe once you learn how to properly use, or rather how to not misuse, spoiler tags.</br>  <br>For some reason I feel like American Spurdo would speak 東北弁.</br>  <br><br>sorry to bother you guys.</br></br>  <br>If it's not beyond N4 grammar, maybe I could help, but you are gonna have to bend down and take the soap for me.</br>  Have any 4chまとめ sites ever catalogued a DJT?

I think he's saying he's happy with the first person who reads his book, but after that I'm not really sure what he's trying to say.

I want you to put in that much effort (to try to like them).</br>  <br>I guess he's talking about <br><br>"I want to have you working hard for me."<br><br>I translated it like that to preserve the subject.

I ask forgiveness for my shitty translation.</br>  <br>3-3.5k plus prewar kanji if you want to read older stuff</br>  <br>ok that makes a lot of sense now.

My post. That was the most unnatural sentence that I thought of.</br></br></br></br>  <br> whats the best way to do that then? <br>By learning Japanese<br> and how long does it take? <br>Depends on how much you focus on kanji as opposed to general Japanese knowledge and experience.</br></br></br></br>  Is there an easy way to learn katakana?<br>I've already spent 10 days on hiragana, and I really don't want to go through that all again. so I was wandering if there's a way I could like 'conjugate' a hiragana to get it katakana equivalent?</br>  <br>You could have just said you don't know rather than giving vague answers asshat.</br>  <br><br>Both my English and Japanese are crap, so forgive my retardness.

There's no objective measure for how long you will take to learn something. The only thing we can tell you is that if you study harder you will get there faster.<br><br>Now stop being an idiot.</br></br></br>  <br>You can put katakana off for a while if you are tired. I think that hiragana is more important.</br>  おなら is the best second person pronoun<br>It starts with お so it's polite.</br>  I need help guys. This is my fifth time taking a go at Japanese and I haven't even once gotten through all of the hiragana. It just kicks my ass. Anyone know any good advice for this hurdle? I feel like once I finally get past this the rest of the language will be a peice of cake.  For me I printed off a chart and searched for the katakana/hiragana whenever I couldn't read it. I was also playing children's video games with lots of it.    <br> once I finally get past this the rest of the language will be a peice of cake. <br>I'd dare say that you're probably mistaken.<br><br>Grind realkana until you got them down. There's no easy way out of this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Try to memorize 5~10 a day, then practice it here: http://realkana.com/<br><br>Dude, but you don't even have to memorize that stuff all at once.

Guess I'll have to get on to that once I have some time.<br><br>There's katakana and hiragana, and they're phonetically redundant, you got that right.<br><br>Kanji are those cute obscure little characters. Stuff like 水 or 糞 or 無. That's Kanji.<br><br>Now, Kanji have multiple ways of being read, and this changes depending on what other Kanji they are used with, or if they are simply being used alone. For example 水 is read as みず, but in the word 水道 it is read as すい.<br><br>Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji are all used all the time in Japanese text, and sometimes they even write stuff which is usually in Hiragana in Kanji, or in Katakana, or they choose to write stuff which is usually in Kanji in Hiragana, or in Katakana. Or sometimes they just write one part in Kanji and one in hiragana, though this is rather rare. Because Japanese is cool like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If someone says will you comb my kawi then you obviously know what they mean. <br><br>I will literally not.</br></br></br>  <br>In his defense, the guide is not the most reader friendly when it comes to explaining Kanji. I'll have to change that sometime.</br>  <br>That's why he should pick one of the many resources mentioned in the guide to read.</br>  <br>Why does the text make the image so much worse?</br>  <br>Well, those resources are far more learning resources than resources which are explaining the basics of Kanji and how they work, and they're in the resources section, so it seems like they're something you should be using once you know what you're doing.<br><br>The guide should be split up into just the guide with the faq, and the resources allocated elsewhere.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know how google docs works, but is there a way to split the guide into "sheets" like the CoR is? Introduction/Overview, Resources, and FAQ sheets maybe?</br>  So there is this sentence 目が覚めて一番に、まぶたが重く、視界が淀んでいるのに気づきました. According to unlimited google works and my little knowledge of japanese it says something about waking up (or opening eyes, wtv), stagnant visibility, heavy eyelids. I know 一番 means first, but my autism does not allow me to fully understand this sentence or the role of 一番に.  <br>目が覚めた時、一番気づいたのは<br>まぶたが重く、視界が淀んでいる<br>ということだ</br></br></br>  <br><br>Because.</br></br>  <br>Not that I knew of, though I'm not horribly familiar with google docs myself. I'll have to write a better introduction to Kanji and maybe overwork some other stuff, and then split the guide and let the people who maintaining the website know.<br>Sometime when i have more time than now.<br><br><br>It means "most of all" or "primarily", the speaker is describing the sensations of waking up in the morning, and the one which overshadowed everything else was the eyelids being heavy.<br><br>That, or what anon here is saying. It depends on how you parse のに, you should know best from context.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I DON'T WANT TO DO MY REPS ANYMORE  <br>JUST</br>  <br>I didn't do my reps in ages.<br><br>I can read Kill Me Baby without having to consult a dictionary very often, and I can read books on my Kindle with a popup dicitonary. Fuck reps, I want to read.</br></br></br>  <br>FUCK</br>  <br>Ohhh, I think I got it now. Thank you very much!</br>  <br>UP</br>  <br><br><br> 12 hours of not doing reps <br><br>You're both plebs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't do my reps since at least 2880 hours.</br>  So, weird question, /djt/.<br>I translated a doujin, but I'm not very good, so I want someone to do TLC.<br>My question is, who is the best of the best at JP to EN translation that could check my work? I don't mind paying, either, if that matters.</br></br>  <br> who is the best of the best at JP to EN translation that could check my work? <br>Hideo Kojima</br></br>  <br>I am currently writing a paper on issues in translating Japanese to English. I could check your work for you.</br>  <br>$1 per page, first page free</br>  <br>Because it kind of deconstructs the joke.</br>  I've got 600 reviews in Anki, someone please give me the motivation to do them ;_;  <br>They're going to steal your work and upload it on exhentai.</br>  <br>Post paper</br>  放屁してやめられないｗｗｗｗ<br><br>お尻爆風から助けてくれえｗｗ</br></br>  <br>Really?<br><br><br>I was looking for some professional site or something. But if you're really interested I'll take whatever help I can get.<br><br>Want to make a throw away e-mail address I can reach you at?<br><br><br>Don't worry. I'm not dumb. I water marked each page. Obviously will not be water marked in the final release.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What kind of cards are they? Vocab/quick recognition cards aren't bad at all; just do them in quick bursts of 50-100 while doing other shit.</br>  <br> no correct punctuation <br>Eh.</br></br>  <br>I'm still in the process of writing it, and I'm far from done. Here's an extract.<br><br>I also translated the last few chapters of 紫色のクオリア, which I had a native proof-read.<br><br><br>you can reach me at seidenfisch@gmail.com<br><br>send me your work, or an extract thereof and let me know how many pages it is and whatnot. I'm a bit busy at the moment, so I'll have to take a look and then let you know if I have the time, but I'm definitely interested.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Sorry if it's a stupid question, but what are 'reps'.<br>I checked the guide and couldn't find it. I'm guessing it's an abbreviation?</br></br>  <br>republics</br>  <br>It's kanji damage...</br>  <br> 自分で考えられない人は何も出来ない人 <br><br>自分で考えられない人は何も出来ないのだ<br>FTFY</br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay, cool. Thank you. I'll e-mail you in just a minute.</br>  <br>gracias</br>  <br>It's a TL check not an English check.</br>  <br>republicans</br>  <br>The hell did you do to get 600 kanji damage reps? Same applies, though; just do it in chunks over the day. If you don't do them today it'll just get worse tomorrow.</br>  <br>Cheers, I'll be heading to bed quite soon, so I'll take a look and let you know tomorrow.</br>  <br>I already know a lot of the easier kanji so I went through a bunch rather quickly and now the reviews are piling up.<br>It's not really difficult but so fucking boring.</br></br>  <br><br>Oh, that makes sense. Thank you.</br></br>  How do I learn hiragana the best way possible?  <br>Real kana.<br>Just select everything and do reps until you get it.</br></br>  <br>Write it out over and over again and use realkana.</br>   anki <br> 2015 <br>that's just sad</br></br>  <br>Oh shit</br>  <br>Write all of them 30-50+ times while pronouncing them, grind them in realkana for a bit, do the same for katakana, and then get an anki deck for katakana (you'll maintain hiragana just from reading, but most grammar guides don't use katakana enough for you to remember all of them as clearly as hiragana). If you have enough free time, you should easily get both of them down in 2 days (maybe one if you focus) this way.</br>  <br>I know this is bait, but got anyother option?</br>  <br>You already know the answer.</br>  <br> purposely gimping yourself because you have a short attention span <br>That's just sad.</br></br>  Is it possible for filthy gaijin to learn Japanese?  <br><br/></br>  <br>If Commie can, then you can too</br>  <br>No i dont thats why i asked, if you dont want to respond just say so.</br>  <br>Just read.</br>  <br>You don't need to know Japanese to take crunchyroll subs and add memes.</br>  <br>B-but the stupid kanji! I used to know around 500 last year with anki and now I don't remember any of them at all.</br>  <br>I'd rather not bring this up because it would cause an existential crisis for this entire thread, but to be honest I think meme knowledge is a more valuable asset than knowing nip.</br>  <br>Beacuse you stopped practicing, i know man it happened the same to me, but i picked up the pace and it was easy as pie, you have to practice everyday, and inmerse yourself /a/non i belive in you</br>  Has anyone else here been farting more than usual since you started studying Japanese?  <br>You are right anon wath are you doing here go to tumblr and reddit the real knowledge its there</br>  <br>ここによく馴染むね</br>  For those of you that recommend to learn kanji through vocabulary and not through a method like RTK, or if you used this "method" yourself, what exactly did you do to help you study the words and therefore the kanji?<br><br>So far I've just been drilling them in Anki, which is frustrating as fuck. Any words with kanji in them, unless the structure of the word is relatively unique and helps aid retention (a word like お手洗い for example, since it it sort of bookended by kana), I have a very hard time remembering which word it is. It's especially difficult to keep straight all the words that are just single kanji paired with a kana ending, like many る-verbs and い-adjectives.<br><br>I'm wondering maybe if I should start writing the words as well, if that might aid retention.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It dosent shows, go to tumblr i bet they will be happy to make your acquaintance</br>  blog time.<br><br>at the 8 month point, going to test the J-cat again. i got ~140 in early march. it's been almost 5 months. going to an hero if i don't make at least 200 this time.</br></br>  <br>I complain about the op a lot but I like this one.<br><br>How do you guys that have made it balance playing video games, reading manga, reading light novels, reading visual novels and watching anime? I don't know if I just want to read all the shit I could never read before like Japanese only games I missed out on, or move to the newest latest thing. I have tons of physical books, games I've purchased, anime to watch. I just don't have time for it all, I read books/VNs too slowly and Japanese games are too grindy. I keep falling behind and behind, the backlog gets bigger and bigger.</br></br></br>  <br>Is the online J-CAT free? How does it work?</br>  <br>The same person who typed out the whole thing, over ten thousand odd sentences, without anyone else pitching in to proof read. Even at a 1% error rate there are going to be a fair few of them. <br><br>Export the deck and open in a spreadsheet. It is a massive amount for a single person. It is only natural that errors are going to be introduced in the process. On the flipside of this without this person having done all of that we wouldn't have a deck to begin with because evidently no one else was willing to either put in the work involved or did not feel the desire to share it with the language learning community. Little did you know that a couple of years ago, before the core decks from the rtk forums and the dojg deck from a member of said forum, the alternatives were of much lower quality and far more dubious when in came to accuracy, but people used them willingly none the less. <br><br>Those starting out learning Japanese now have little idea of how much better they have easy access to compared to even only going back to two or three years ago. <br><br>tl;dr: instead of asking who to blame, ask how you can help. We're all in this together and our time certainly isn't being recompensed for any efforts exhibited for others.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sign up<br>Wait a few hours to a day<br>Take it</br></br></br>  I've been working on translating some works as practice, but I'm running into issues with translating abilities with kanji and the pronunciations that do not correspond in anyway beyond some logical correspondence. (Example: 一方通行 -&gt; アクセラレータ).<br><br>I would usually just write how it's pronounced, but there is a large segment in the source material where the characters basically go over the naming process so I can't really leave the written part out.

Anyone find a Japanese e-book seller that doesn't require a VPN and Japanese cc to buy from? Shit is frustrating as fuck.  Are German manga scanlations decent? Since I'm learning German and Japanese I thought I could read the same manga in both languages.  Any help with this panel? I'm having trouble putting it together.

Or should I get what it means, finish the story, and worry about that latter (I have some cool flash cards for anki that I might can use to do that (haven't tried them to see if they're good or not))?  <br>Personally I'd advice against learning Japanese (and German) from manga, especially if you're new to reading.<br>You'd think manga is easy, but since the sentences are short they're often full of slang and vagueness, and the dictionary won't help you with those.<br>You'll get a lot more practice from reading a book, and it's most likely going to be easier.</br></br></br>  <br>The amount of reviews will go up over time.</br>  <br><br>What kind of books though is the question.</br></br>  <br>Learn to write hiragana.

Just go read stuff instead of expecting anonymous moral support.</br>  <br>By not being retarded.</br>  <br>It's not bad for me at all. In fact, having the actual term in the background will make it seep in more.</br>  The sentence for 腕 on anki uses 太い in a positive light, yet the 太い sentence was calling someone fat. Is that a nuance thing like "Oh man, he has fat arms!" but we don't actually mean fat, or does it not mean fat with a negative connotation?  <br>The reason it's not sticking is that you're not reading enough. Reading -&gt; comprehending -&gt; acquiring. This is the only path. My whole life was just reading books.</br>  <br>You just have to struggle through it and keep looking up stuff you don't know. Eventually it will become ingrained. Don't try to memorize out of textbooks by the way, that's retarded. Consider finding a graded reader series or something to work through, they introduce new grammar incrementally which can help.</br>  <br>Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but... Supposedly, it's like thick/plump/big. It can be used offensively, but it doesn't have an insipid flavor by itself.</br>  <br>It can also mean thick, can't it?</br>  <br><br>It's probably thick as in muscular, but it COULD be fat, it depends on context.</br></br>  <br>That's what it said, but the first said fat and since it was calling someone fat, I figured it was basically just fat. Thanks, guess it's more of </br>  hey djt i have no time, i can find it but i don't want to, i've grown sick of anki. Wat do? where do you find will to learn more?  Should I trust KanjiDamage's definition for a word when the jap dictionary gives me a different definition?  <br>No. J-J &gt; E-J<br>Pretty much the only argument for going "monolingual" is that non-native dictionaries pretty much universally suck once you get past the basics.</br></br>  <br>D E K I N A I<br>E<br>K<br>I<br>N<br>A<br>I</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is the online dictionary "Jisho" credible?

Physical dictionries sound like hell.</br></br>  <br>It literally just called the guys arms 太い, 彼の腕は太いです。Or something along those lines. The picture and English translation were that meant that he had muscular / "fat" / "thick" / 22 in. biceps. I was just under the impression that 太い held the same connotations as fat in English and was asking if the sentence was an anomaly (it makes sense to do that in English too, but in a roundabout way that I hope wouldn't appear in any English learning book because of similar confusions).</br>  <br>so, it's just impossible and i can't learn japanese? Ok then i'll read every book in my sight</br>  Today I learned about burying. I'm going to double my daily new cards and let myself bury things that won't sink in.

But, don't get too excited--Japanese cups are measured larger than almost every Western culture. Those "G" cups are probably large D's.</br>  <br> And as seen in  she's a smart girl and she has support, she'll be OK. <br><br>... being willing to have sex with anyone who begs her means she's a smart girl and will be ok?</br></br></br>  <br>no, don't stop</br>  <br><br>Wait am I missing something?

I just completely glossed over her name whilst reading it and didn't make the connection because I was going based purely off appearances looking back.</br>  <br>/fit/ ebin meme.<br><br>It was about some faggots hooking up "please be in london" responses.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a meme from /fit/ that has lost all context at this point, and originated with some dude asking if a person was from London. Use google.</br>  Mayu seems sweet. I'd date her and treat her nicely. Not like she needs it since she has her brother.<br><br>Shame stuff like  happens to her though.</br></br>  <br><br>Thanks dear kind anons</br></br>  <br>every single fucking time</br>  <br>To be fair she's supposed to be acting retarded right there.</br>  <br>Typically, you wouldn't consider being mind-broken into a childlike state with an unhealthy sexual obsession with a family member a "positive" thing. <br><br>Finding the silver lining in this is like surviving a car accident that killed your whole family. It's really great that you figured out how to be positive, but your whole family is still dead.</br></br></br>  <br><br>So the bully ended up becoming Tomo, Mayu ended up becoming Cotton Candy and glasses ended up becoming Misuzu?</br></br>  <br><br>And also the car raped you somehow</br></br>    <br><br> coming up to her after every class and saying 'Dummy' <br><br>This is the strangest yet most well-organized attempt at bullying I have ever seen</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd agree with you if it the doujin were actually the story of how she got raped and mind-broken, but it isn't, so I don't. Nothing bad happens to her in the story.<br><br><br>Mayu is glasses. You mean Ameri.</br></br></br></br>  <br>wait what the FUCK<br><br>THOSE ARE THE SAME MOTHERFUCKERS<br><br>WHAT<br><br>WHAT THE FUCK<br><br>that just blew my fucking mind, is bring you down in my heart canon?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I dunno man what happens if Tomo is in the bathroom between classes instead of sitting at her desk?<br><br>Then her whole bullying schedule is ruined</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sure, but she's clearly recovering over time. She's better in the Chiyuri one, a few years on we can assume.</br></br>  <br>They aren't the same. The only thing they have is same faces and somewhat similar hair.</br>  <br>Gain info from smug.</br>  <br><br>No, their personalities don't match.</br></br>  <br>I hope he reuses all his designs.</br>  <br> rape with a condom <br>...Huh.</br></br>  <br>Gotta dispose the evidence after all...</br>  <br>It's just so unusual to see in 2D porn.</br>  <br>I love the way Misuzu tilt her head 5° before talking to Tomo</br>  <br>You're causing her enough trouble anyway, might as well not cause anymore.</br>  <br><br>What a thoughtful rapist</br></br>   Good at othello <br> Not a chess <br><br>She is not a westerner</br></br></br>  <br>And your family<br><br>It is--the exposition is still part of the story. It doesn't matter that the bad things are over, they still happened. They don't just magically disappear, as made obvious by her mental state.<br><br>I think it's supposed to take place after all that, isn't it? Regardless, I'm not saying it's a BAD END or anything, but it's certainly far from happy. Silver linings are specifically used to denote the ironically positive outcomes of otherwise negative situations. The silver lining here is that she's getting better and her brother loves her, despite being kidnapped and drugged-up rape toy. Is the situation still "negative"? Maybe not, but the existence of the silver lining context itself implies things are not all well.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> And your family <br><br>Before or after the wreck?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Yes </br></br>  <br> It is--the exposition is still part of the story. It doesn't matter that the bad things are over, they still happened. They don't just magically disappear, as made obvious by her mental state. <br><br>Stories about positive things happening to people who've had bad things happen to them before are still stories about positive things. <br><br> Maybe not, but the existence of the silver lining context itself implies things are not all well. <br>You're the only one calling it a silver lining.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>is that the same Mayu?</br>  <br>Yep.</br>  <br>Did you break out a fucking protractor?</br>  <br>I think by this point we've all seen enough Shaft tilts to gauge degrees by sight</br>  <br>So before. That's nice I guess.</br>  <br>Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken is webcomic that got anime.</br>  <br>But does Tomo-chan have any themes that the government wants to push on lonely otakus?</br>  <br>Exercise so you can get to Tomo-chan's level?</br>  <br> right gets vanilla dickings <br> left is mindbroken then gets vanilla dickings <br> middle is straight up raped <br>why?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bullies get their comeuppance.<br><br>By being cummed-up in.</br></br></br>  <br>Middle gets pretty polite rape, though. They drug her without her knowing and use a condom and everything. Mayu had it the worst for sure.</br>  <br> polite rape <br>now, I know where we are, but...</br></br>  <br>Be polite, THEN rape?</br>  <br>As far as she knows, she goes to sleep, wakes up, and continues with her day.</br>  <br>on 2D perception, it look like 5. But i think in real life, her head probably tilt more than that. I would say 10 to 15</br>  <br>I mean they could hold her down and rape her but instead shes not conscious.<br><br>Thats a good amount of consideration.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I mean, I've been called out here for being naive before, but this is some next level asocial shit right here.</br></br>  <br><br>bruhs</br></br>  <br>Yes, congratulations, something in hentai has different standards than real life and you disagree with it. Would you also like to argue the morality behind loli? Maybe reason that tentacles make no biological sense?</br>  <br>I can't remember if she was a virgin, but if she wasn't, they basically didn't affect her life in any way except use up an hour of her time.</br>  <br>Look anon someone can rob you by stabbing you then taking your wallet or just take your wallet.<br><br>Which one is more polite?</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's the "tree falls in the forest" argument. the problem is that you're overlapping 2D and 3D a bit too much, so just be careful.</br></br>  So how about that update? <br><br>Does not wearing a sports bra make Cotton Candy a slut?</br></br>  <br>That its northwest mexican tier robbing, What i think you meant to say is that someone stabs you then calls for a ambulance.</br>  <br>If it were in 3D, I honestly might have a similar opinion. I'd still have it illegal, of course, because "it's legal as long as the victim doesn't find out" is a horrible policy and would never work as intended, but I wouldn't care that much about the act itself.</br>  <br>Yes, that's why I don't mind my wife NTRing me so long she never gets STDs, gets pregnant and if I never find out since technically speaking it is as good as a none-existent issue :^).</br>  <br>So, the spats are her underwear and every can see her underwear all the time?</br>  <br>in the same way short shorts are underwear.</br>  <br>Tomo is way to shy for that.</br>  <br> polite rape <br><br>Well against all odds, I think that may be a new one.<br><br>I'd like to politely murder someone, how would I go about that?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You neatly give them a peaceful, painless death &amp; an honourable burial afterwards,</br>  <br>The problem with NTR is the emotional betrayal - if my wife was raised in some commune and no one ever mentioned the concept of a single sexual partner to her before I caught her NTRing me, I wouldn't care, whereas I would care if someone who had never been taught that rape was wrong was raping someone. So since it's the willingness to NTR that's the betrayal, I don't think the lack of knowledge changes anything.<br><br><br>Drug them and then off them quickly and painlessly, or else give them forewarning and time to prepare shit, I don't know which.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The same way Japanese characters do it from time to time, "Can you please let me kill you?"</br>  <br>Never heard of euthanasia?</br>  I'd like her to jump my rope.  <br>I'd grab her mounds of cotton candy anytime.</br>  <br>Very causal.</br>  <br><br>Swap incoming.

It is literally proof of God existence. The greatest anime to be aired. It has plot,action, betrayal, saints, best girls, bunny.<br><br><br>Why aren't you watching the anime of our generation?Why...?</br></br></br>   intentionally watching cuck: the anime   That bunny deserves to be raped.  i dropped it in the latest episode because of cuck knight and "let's try to kill each other because MISUNDERSTANDINGS"  <br>It has a bad budget.</br>  <br>She's delicious though.</br>  <br>Why has IRC latched onto this show? Is the LN popular or something?</br>  <br>I'm not going to lie I'm just watching this for Bunny thighs, I don't even know the name of half the cast nor the plot, I just want delicious Bunny meat, maybe I'll bother watching it seriously when the last episode will air.</br>  <br>no, no misunderstandings.  bullet-chan really has been going around killing heroes who she thinks might get "chosen" </br>  <br>This.<br><br>I don't like where all that is going. <br>It's a shame because The Strongest Man Alive™ and Bunny really seemed to have hit it off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>what the fuck<br><br>maybe i'll undrop it</br></br></br>  I haven't watched the anime but the MC in the LN was pretty much Naruto so I dropped it.  <br>IRC been such a wimp these days they can't even target shows properly.</br>  <br>That wascally wabbit is playing him.</br>  <br>Everyday until bunny stop fucking her dog?</br>  <br>There's only one good thing about this show</br>  <br><br>yes. and god is good. or at least doesn't have shit taset.</br></br>  <br>Vol 5. Spoilers  confirmed not a virgin for her ambitions and she is the traitor  <br><br>Enjoy.</br></br></br>  <br> them thighs </br>  <br><br>Its an ok series. I like the mayan/aztec influence.<br>MC is not a complete faggot or dumbass.</br></br></br>  <br>She's a qt.</br>  <br>What did she sold herself for?</br>  is there any other recentish anime that actually has a party going on an adventure <br><br>everything today is always this fucking rpg inspired shit where they say game terms in dialogue and just hang around a town the whole series</br></br>  <br><br>You must be devastated when the first girl to show up doesn't end up with the MC.<br><br>Have you almost recovered from Naruto?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Political aid from prince of different country</br>  <br> Fat dog dick. </br>  <br>hunter x hunter</br>  <br>OKish prince or faceless fat oldman tier prince?</br>  So this isn't haremshit and the MC gets with the chunni gun girl?  <br> You must be devastated when the first girl to show up doesn't end up with the MC. <br>Not usually, no. I just liked the bunny gal, that's all.<br> Have you almost recovered from Naruto? <br> Watching Naruto  <br> Sakura a shit. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the show still hasn't really settled into any recognizable pattern, i still don't know what this show is about. maybe it'll become a harem? maybe it's about fighting lots of monsters every episode?<br><br>well it's based off an LN so i'm sure others know</br></br></br>  <br>chaika</br>  <br><br>No harem at all, MC sticks with chuuni gunny and not the bunny. That's probably why the anime won't sell.</br></br>  the only good thing about this anime is the way characters fight, everything else is generic stuff we see almost every season  <br>i highly doubt there will be a harem considering the black knight is in love with bunny</br>    <br> MC sticks with chuuni gunny and not the bunny <br>Picked up</br></br>  <br><br>Oh boy, she's fucking delicious.<br><br>Picked up.</br></br></br></br>  Show is bad. It felt like a chore to watch the first episode    <br>Nice OVAs.</br>  <br>Chaos Dragon.<br><br> OH WAIT </br></br></br>  <br><br>Sure, whatever. But to call it cuck? You must be delusional.</br></br>  Someone spoil me the whole thing already  let me get this straight bunnies a whore?  <br>That bunny girl is built for repopulating the Earth after any and every mass extinction.</br>  <br>Bunny has the strongest libido and lowest willpower</br>  <br>So yuri bunnies a pure? I think you get it, but I don't see why you ask that in this thread.</br>  <br>Bunny betrays group<br>Knight is autisticly stronk. Doesnt know if he should help hime or help group. <br>MC=brainwashed</br></br></br>  I havent played the games, but i can see where this is going.  The final seal requires the lives of all the chosen ones?   If MC would drop the fucking Strongest Man in the World shit, I would enjoy this anime alot more, but I want to punch him everytime he says it.  <br><br>so the bunny doesn't sleep around shes just a lair?</br></br>  <br>A lair for what?<br> Worms? </br></br>  <br> those thighs <br>Delicious. Also,<br><br> silver-haired girl <br> voiced by Yuuki Aoi <br> is a love interest and according to LN the main one <br>Subarashii</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm watching it for bunny girl and now flower girl too.</br>  <br>His crap isn't even the focus of the damn show, you autistic fool. He does it to bait other warriors and draw attention to himself, the audience isn't suppose to be baited themselves.</br>  <br>woops meant to say liar<br><br>my question still stands though<br><br/></br></br></br></br>  How many volumes do you think the anime will cover, LNfags?  <br>MC is still cancer though</br>  <br>At this rate, one</br>  No bunny love?  <br>That's fair considering there's a good chance she was directly responsible for said mass extinction.</br>  Where does the "she takes the knot" thing come from, anyway?  <br>bunny doesn't give a shit about mc. she's using him.</br>  <br> The CQC and distraction being an attention whore <br>Seems like he is doing his job perfectly, you expect a kuudere to fit that role?<br><br> Loving traitors of mankind </br></br></br></br>  I just finished reading the first volume and oh SHIT! DAT PLOT TWIST!  <br>It looks generic and boring as fuck, haven't even given episode 2 a try yet<br><br><br>How's she a traitor?

Its position in number 3 in 2013 all came from votes from industry insiders, not the otaku public.<br>LN was not even popular or sold well among otaku. How can this be pandering shit?</br></wbr></br>  <br>misquote?</br>  ^ Oh SHIT. Was replying to<br><br><br>not<br/></br></br></br>  <br> How can this be pandering shit? <br>Being from Bantorra's author I highly suspect that thing was by no mean thought to be otaku pandering and really is just the author wanking around with tropes he likes.</br></br>  <br>man her eyes are fuckin HAIRY</br>  <br><br><br>Cheers anons. Will watch soon.</br></br></br>  <br> 1st Vol <br> That detective act written by retard <br><br> Even Fremy is not enough to stop from dropping this shit</br></br></br></br>  <br>Watched the first three episodes just now. Guess I'll be following it.</br>  <br> I really never understood why the other heroes believed him about all the stuff he was saying about the heat and the mist; he basically explained it all and then went "well, I know science, so just trust me on this one, guys" and they all went along with it even though they're all out for his blood and it's known that he's extremely cunning. </br>  <br>Yes.</br>  I wish that Nips get a taste and this, or even just the source material, will sell well  <br> confirmed not a virgin for her ambitions and she is the traitor <br>Oh wait, this reminds of someone. Yeah that's totally not the main heroine from the author's previous work.</br></br>  The design of the 2 new chars really marked a new low in this series.  <br>Just wait until you meet Rolonia</br>  <br>Why Big bad always comes again, what is that thing?</br>  Would have been way more happy with this show if it was just Aztec Batman fucking shit up improv style.    <br>I guess you will like Mora</br>  <br>I was severely disappointed that we didn't even get any mesoamerican lore/mythology/mysticism up in this shit. Fucking blueballed when I realized it was just an anime original idea to add that 'theme'. No wonder I felt it was underutilized as fuck.</br>  <br>Yeah that was super disappointing, it was so promising.</br>  <br>At this point I expect the plot to go absolutely nowhere.</br>  <br>Just caught up and I'm loving it, I'm getting Legend of the Legendary Heroes vibes from it with the character interactions and adventures, I'll probably read the LN after the anime finishes airing.<br><br>Fremy is the best girl.</br></br></br>  is this another Gary Stu anime?  <br>I want to violently rape bunny in an animalistic brutal way that leaves her bleeding from scratches and bite marks and oozing my cum from her ass, mouth and vagina.<br><br>I've never felt this way before. What's wrong with me /a/?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah because the other heroes are brainless as a tard that's why   except Hans  </br>  <br>Yes, Adlet is the strongest man in the world.</br>  <br> brutal rape <br> not wanting hours of sweet pure love making <br> not wanting to nestle your head inbetween those fantastic breasts while she hugs you afterwards <br>honestly I think both our points are valid</br></br></br></br>  Has there ever been a more sensual manga than Berserk? <br><br>And no i don't mean borderline porn with tits and dumb bitches with their tongues out i mean pure raw sensuality on a fucking black and white page.</br></br>  Also related, Farnese makes my dick rock hard  <br>One of the better pages.<br><br> oh, shes not possessed... </br></br></br>  <br>Know dat feel</br>  <br>Would lick the blood off those pecs no homo</br>  <br> tfw no more crazy sexually frustrated Farnese <br> fucking CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT <br> they'll never get out of the damn boat <br>Why Miura why?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Farnese suddenly completely reboots her character from "sexually frustrated zealot currently in huge doubt about her own faith toward God and her own beliefs toward the doctrine and the nature of God himself" to "man i fucking love magic" <br><br>MIURA</br></br></br>  <br><br> entire faith shattered by guts/demons <br> only person you love doesn't want to sex you up <br> know the world is ending and you're too weak to do anything <br><br>Her change was handled well, I just hope we see Casca go from drooling idiot back to delicious brown tsundere.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She can stay drooling...

I know I am!, Law and Luffy took out Doffy and are now going in for the kill on Kaido which means Kidd has equal game on Shank's head. <br><br>RIP 2 Yonkos, I wonder who's taking Big Mom's place though, I doubt she's even worth the effort, her fat ass will die before anyone can kill her.<br><br>I love Luffy's generation, WORST GENERATION FOR THE FUCKING WIN!</br></br></br></br>  <br> There are people who seriously think Derossa was HALF as good as Alabasta  <br><br> There will also be retards who'll respond to this post by going "No, it's even better" <br><br>Marineford Babies are the worst.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Usopp Usopp don't die, find a doctor! <br>It scares me that this gag has recurred in multiple arcs</br></br>  What music do you think will play when Luffy uses King Kong gun in the anime?    What if the reason Zoro hasn't had a difficult fight yet post time-skip is because of pic related, when usopp says that it would take two years for zoro to recover from his wounds inflicted by mihawk, meaning that pre-timeskip, zoro was never fighting at full capacity but now that two years has gone by he is fully recovered from his fight with mihawk  <br>agreed</br>   Kidfag <br><br>suppose it was only a matter of time, really</br></br>  <br>No, it's even better</br>  <br>If they can get Bonney involved and have her turn Shanks into a kidd or Old man then it'll be interesting. <br>Any indication Kidd working for BB?</br></br>  <br>he's saying it would take 2 years for Zoro to even move <br><br>clearly Zoro isnt normal</br></br></br>    <br>Does it automatically mean that when a Yonkou is defeated, whoever defeats them becomes the new Yonkou? Because there's three pirates in Kid's alliance and I think they're supposed to be "equals". <br><br>I'm thinking the whole system will be fucked up. Fujitora is seeking to abolish the Shichibukai. The Supernovas are trying to screw up the Yonkou. I look at this as the three powers being almost if not totally demolished. Like how Law was talking about gears in Punk Hazard.</br></br></br>  <br>overtaken<br>or gomu gomu bazooka</br></br>  <br>Bonney seems oddly adoring of Luffy<br><br>I doubt she'd help Kidtachi</br></br></br>  <br>He who kills the Yonko and takes his territory becomes the new Yonko. So you have to take control of their land and kill them or just take their land and power thus you're the new Yonko.</br>  <br>I was thinking the actual 18th century symposium that played during the defeat of crocodile "into the new world"<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qkC<wbr>a90YLiag</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>The main issue with Dressrosa, the main difference, is that Luffy did not grow. He was already strong enough to win, his crew was already stronger than Doffy too. In Alabasta each member had to become stronger, Nami learned to control weather, Zoro to cut steel, Sanji fought a tranny martial artist.<br>Dressrosa didn't have a real sense of fear for the straw hats but Alabasta did.<br><br>It is impossible to do Alabasta twice for that reason, that is why Dressrosa is underwhelming. <br><br>Also the DF Awakening was underwhelming compared to the Alabasta reveal of DF imbued objects.<br><br>Also the way Oda set up Luffy learning Crocodile weakness to water was 10/10</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think that the yonkou thing doesn't specifically require four people. It's just called the yonkou because there are four. I don't see why there has to be some arbitrary number of them. They could easily just be the sankou or the gokou.<br><br>I figure if there isn't immediately a replacement like Blackbeard to take Whitebeard, then the remaining yonkou just sort of take over the turf of the fallen one.<br>You'd generally think there's a replacement, but it's not like this system has been in place for very long. None of them had died before Whitebeard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know? Now that I think about it Luffy had trained the ENTIRE time on an island full of all sorts of beasts. <br>And guess what? He'll be facing off against Kaidou who will likely be all sorts of beasts. Bravo oda.</br></br>  <br>Is this your assumption or was this stated anywhere in the manga? This is an honest question, not meant to insult or anything.</br>  <br> Law brought Luffy to the island so he knows this too. <br>Bravo anon</br></br>  <br>Not him but it is shown rather than stated.<br>Blackbeard killed Whitebeard and now he's a Yonko.</br></br>  <br>goddamn croc was a weak shit during alabasta, losing to pre gear 2nd luffy. how the hell did he fight people like doffy, akainu, mihawk, jozu during marineford?? alabasta luffy who is supposedly&gt;crocodile could not do that.</br>  <br>because he was underestimating Luffy the entire time<br><br>He let Luffy chip damage him to zero</br></br></br>  <br>As I understood it, it was more like Whitebeard died and Blackbeard knew a lot about the seas and WB's territory because he was a former crewmate so he had an edge on the others entering the New World. <br><br>So you still have to take territories after defeating a Yonkou, yes? It just doesn't get passed on to you. Fishman Island was under Big Mom's protection when it was previously WB's.<br><br><br> I think that the yonkou thing doesn't specifically require four people. It's just called the yonkou because there are four. I don't see why there has to be some arbitrary number of them. They could easily just be the sankou or the gokou. <br><br>Good point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What would happen if Blackbeard grabbed Luffy while he was in gear 3? Would losing his rubberness with all the air in him cause his limb to explode? Would he be able to hold it together with haki?  <br>Luffy used haki unconsciously to win the final exchange, since he punched through Crocodiles cutting attack which sliced solid rock the previous time it was shown.<br>Same shit happened vs Arlong.<br><br>The Straw Hat helped Luffy win.</br></br></br></br>  <br>do you actually believe this?</br>  <br>Because Crocodile second in command Mrs Allsunday was a traitor</br>    <br>Power creep. <br>Don't think too much of it, it happens to every shounen over time.</br></br>    <br>Forgotpic</br>  http://onepiecepodcast.com/2015/07/<wbr>20/working-with-eiichiro-oda-an-int<wbr>erview-with-one-piece-editor-suguru<wbr>-sugita/<br><br> Well, now that we’re in the second half of the story, I think there will be more and more chapters that revolve around the main plot. The Four Emperors will also appear more in the story, so I think you’ll really enjoy what happens next! </br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr>  I'm pretty hype if Fujitora tries to follow his commands. Having both a Warlord and Admiral defeated would be some real shit assuming Luffy and Law can fight the following morning.  <br>Two knocked out novas versus a full health admiral. Yep, def gonna happen.</br>  <br>Fuji is just New World Aokiji<br><br>he'll follow them around lazily but otherwise isnt doing shit</br></br></br>  <br>its stated by territory, right after the war when the gorosei are talking i think. BB was in WBs crew for a long time and knew where all thin freshly unclaimed land would be and had crew that could solo cap an island each so it just happened to go to him</br>  <br>I am saddened when I see these threads and I have no recollection of reading some of these pages ;_;<br><br>Perhaps it's my due time for a re-read</br></br></br>  <br> 30% of the story left <br><br>w-what?? theres still so many unresovled things, I don't want it to end too soon :(</br></br></br>  <br>You can't remember a page from two weeks ago.</br>  <br>that page was literally 2 weeks ago chapter, are you sure you arent a speed reader with alzheimers?</br>  <br>30% ends at chapter 1100 or so.<br><br>It's as far from now as the start of the series from Luffy fighting Lucci.</br></br></br>  <br> the following morning. <br>I think this information alone allows us to deduce Fuji is letting them go.<br>If he wanted them he'd have the marines pick them off the ground as soon as the doffy fight was done.</br></br></br>  <br>Oda or one of his editors said OP was half way done back during the end of Skypeia. I'd take it with a grain of salt.<br><br>I'm just glad the Yonko are going to play a more active role now.</br></br></br>  <br>He is NOT going to come after Luffy/Law. He's saying he's fine with not coming back to Marine HQ.<br><br><br>Because Oda can't break muh monster trio, he's too strong and there are too many crewmembers wah wah wah.<br><br>Same shit you see in these threads all the time. They don't read the series, though so they couldn't know half the shit they spew.<br><br><br>Marinefordbabbies like Dressrosa? That's a new one.<br><br><br>Neat. But to be around 70% of the story? Hmm.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How come people are acting like Vivi isn't already part of the crew. <br>Jinbe could have joined and then went on a solo mission, instead he said "he, ill join later." which is a deathflag or at minimum "some shit will block him from joining" flag.</br></br>  <br>he's going to have some Big Mom conflict but he'll still join. <br><br>He and Luffy are blood-brothers afterall</br></br></br>  <br> brothers <br>Another proof he won't join/will die</br></br>  <br>How much do you think there's left of Berserk?</br>  <br><br><br>Oh shieet I somehow missed last week's WSJ release. Well another example is Kuzan/Aokiji's appearance post-timeskip</br></br></br>  <br> Nearly $25million a year <br><br>Holy crap</br></br></br>  <br>Caribou will tell<br> that man <br>That Shirahoshi is Poseidon.<br>That's where Jinbe, strongest fish man in the world (deathflag), will get blocked from ever joining.</br></br></br></br>  Would I be right in saying his reintroduction was ambiguous?<br><br>Capone working for Mam is a boring to me since we already have the yonkou underling dynamic with Drake/Kaidou.<br>I'd much prefer Capone to be striking out alone.<br><br>Why would he be after Ceasar though?<br>Ceasar probably has wares that can be traded on the black market.<br>I think it would be interesting to see Capone make a play for becoming the top Broker...might also suit his namesake since it's a black market vibe.<br>Does this sound like headcannon or a reasonable theory? I can never tell when it's my own.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no idea, miura does what he wants. I just hope the announcement about monthly releases holds up, and we actually do get monthly chapters.</br>  <br>He was on Big Mom's fucking ship.</br>  <br>Sabo seems to be doing just fine though</br>  <br>law said to survive in the new world you either take out a yonko or join a yonko, and no supernova can take them out alone, so I think its fine if he's working for big mom, just makes him a less important character compared to say captain kid. drake is ambiguous, he might join luffy/law</br>  <br>Sabo has more deathflags than any other character in One Piece.<br><br>He even did and said the exact same things Ace did before he died almost word for word, and Zoro explicitly commented on this.</br></br></br>  <br>What if Caribou tells Kizaru?<br>Think about it, Kizaru killed the sun pirates. Kizaru is Proven 100% loyal to tenryubito, and the tenryubito are actively trying to acquire the ancient weapons as Proven at water 7<br>Jinbe vs Kizaru means no Jinbe cremate</br></br></br>  <br> He was on <br>near, He was NEAR Big Mom's ship</br></br>  <br><br>Which translation is this.<br>Seems decent.</br></br></br>  <br>that's assuming they actually parallel 100%<br><br>I doubt they do. It'd make no sense to replace Ace only to kill him off as well</br></br></br>  <br>He was on big mom's ship. You can see the fucking candy canes.</br>  <br>I guess you forgot CP0 was on Dressrosa at the same time as Sabo and the obvious possibility that Koala is an agent.<br>No one guessed Blueno the bartender was a spy either.</br></br>  <br> stripes are candycane <br><br>anon...</br></br></br>  <br>You're in fucking denial of something that was explicitly shown so it fits your fanfiction better, and you're trying to be the bigger person here?</br>  <br>that's some wild speculating you're doing there</br>  <br> obvious possibility that Koala is an agent. <br><br>With such amazing evidence as....</br></br></br>  <br>prove its candy cane then and not just stripes?</br>  <br>It is speculation that Koala is a spy.<br>It is a fact that every reader was surprised when CP9 was unmasked, and will be when CP0 is too.<br>Sorry if that offends you</br></br></br>  <br>these two things arent linked because you type them together, m8<br><br>no idea what you're getting worked up over.

Why must CP0 be the same as CP9? because CP1-8 also did that, right?</br></br>  <br>tobi was obito</br>  <br>I said nothing like that and you know it<br><br>you're running purely on speculation and getting pissed when people point out how stupid you're being</br></br></br>    <br>The hilarious part about that is that this twist was SO obvious the entire reason people started doubting it was because it was just too fucking obvious so it couldn't be true.</br>  <br>Anybody close to the second in command of the revolutionary army.<br>Not anybody we've seen. All the CP9 agents were close friends with their assassination target.<br><br>you are falsely telling me what I am arguing. I am not affirming koala as a spy, just stating that she fits the mold in the same way CP9 did in that they were members of the same organization as Iceberg, not "anyone we've seen."</br></br></br></br>  <br>By your logic, even Fuji might be a CP0 member. muh surprise. Or even the king of the dwarves!<br><br>In simples manner, it's not really possible for Koala because she's too short (and don't try that whole midgets in overcoat shit.</br></br></br>  <br> . I am not affirming koala as a spy, just stating that she fits the mold in the same way CP9 did in that they were members <br><br>To put it another way "I'm not saying Koala is a spy, but she totally is". I'm not sure if you legitimately think you're saying something different, but that's what you're fucking typing dude.</br></br></br>  <br> just stating that she fits the mold in the same way CP9 did <br><br>you can replace Koala with literally any other name and nothing would change</br></br></br>  <br> an infiltrator in Dragons army wouldn't need a good back story. <br><br> koalatellingsaboitsgoodhedidntsave<wbr>ace.Png </wbr> <br>Anyway my argument is that Sabo has death flags, good derail by focusing on koala who I mentioned as hypothetical example.</br></br></br></br>  <br> who I mentioned as hypothetical example. <br><br>that's your own fault though. Your theory holds no water either way</br></br></br>  <br>Gomu Gomu no Autism!</br>  <br>No my logic explicitly excludes them because they are not close with Sabo in any way, having met him less than 24 hours ago in canon, whereas my logic requires they were close to Sabo for years and years like how kaku and friends stayed with iceberg for like a decade.</br>  <br>My god<br><br>Luffy is a CP0 agent.</br></br></br>  <br>Its completely feasible as it mirrors CP9 being long time friends and subordinates of their assassination target.<br>You are arguing that it is unfeasible even though it was the water 7 saga</br></br>  <br>Except we know he is not.<br>You are either just being antagonistic or very dumb.<br>Luffy hasn't talked to Sabo before today in story since he was like 6 years old, so it violates the logic, as well.</br></br></br>  watch this retard be right, and koala turns out to be a cp0 agent.<br><br>post YFW</br></br>  <br> Except we know he is not. <br><br>That's why it's proof, because it was surprising when the CP9 agents were revealed, and it would be surprising if Luffy was revealed as a CP0 agent.</br></br></br>  <br> mirrors <br>prove that it's a mirror or even happening right now?<br><br>you have no clue IF CP0 is after Sabo in particular or someone we havent even seen yet<br><br>you're just assumin because they're in the general area that they must be linked when Dressrosa introduced something like 30 characters</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But why Sabo? The CP0 were said to have been mobilized to take out Doffy. Shouldn't they be close to him then?<br>Plus, why do you think Oda will follow the same approach to CP0 as he did with CP9. Such blatant repetition just isn't his style. There's a better chance CP0 will be handled nothing like the 9 so all conjectures based on it are potentially a waste.</br></br>  <br> That's why it's proof, because it was surprising </br>  <br><br>She won't be she's the girl fisher tiger rescued. She'd never work for the CDs</br></br>  <br> being the is much of a troll <br>I just feel bad for you at this point.<br>The only CP9 agent who wasn't working for iceberg and also his good friend of many years was Spandam.</br></br></br>  <br>Its not proof, it is well reasoned speculation based on the known modes operandi of another in canon branch of the WG.<br>It could easily be wrong, but it is not "wild speculation," which was the initial criticism.</br></br>  <br>And Jyabura. And Fukuro. And Kumadori.<br><br>Does Nero count too, even though nobody remembers him?</br></br></br>  <br> CP0 is Koala and Hack <br> CP0 is all of Dragon's subordinates <br> Dragon is the CP0 boss <br> they're all conspiring against Sabo for working with Dragon's persona as a revolutionary </br></br></br></br>  <br> Marinefordbabbies like Dressrosa? That's a new one. <br><br>Marfineford and Dressrosa were both just giant arcs about a bunch of new characters fighting each other with minimal character development for the Straw Hats. It makes sense they'd like Dressrosa.</br></br></br>   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=UK<wbr>8-wh-oLp4</wbr>  [ ] <br> tfw Roci's voice is manlier than Doffy's </br>  <br>So some agents weren't, this doesn't affect the veracity of my speculation though because the means of assassination primarily relied on the members who were friends with Iceberg.<br><br>It is a reasonable speculation I'm not sure why you are so aggressively attacking it with fallacy.</br></br></br>  <br> well reasoned <br><br>You seriously call something with no evidence whatsoever 'well-reasoned'.<br><br>Literally the only support for your argument is that it would resemble what happened in Water7. For fuck's sake, you don't even have any evidence that there's more than the three agents we already saw in CP0, that they've infiltrated the revolutionaries (who nobody knew was on the island), that Koala is one of them, why Koala would have stayed behind if she was one of them when they were explicitly stated in the last chapter to have completely left the island, etc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it is well reasoned speculation <br> Koala might be CP0 <br> because she works with Sabo <br> who the CP0 were obviously around to apprehend <br> because of COURSE Sabo is being doublecrossed <br> because he's deathflagged <br> because he's Luffy's brother </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where did I state that ALL of galley la were infiltrators?</br>  <br>Because it's not reasonable, it's insane. You have no proof, nothing other than 'parallels', without even any evidence to suggest that the series is following parallels, that the parallels apply in this instance, why they specifically apply to Koala instead of, say, Hack, or anything at all. There's absolutely nothing supporting a single thing you're saying, and the fact that you don't seem to grasp this. The fact that you repeatedly and consistently are getting details of the story wrong is also not helping.</br>  <br>There is substantial evidence that Oda heavily mirrored Alabasta in Dressrosa, though. And he set up a spy agency involvement for the next saga and also revealed Sabo as the #2 rev, had Sabo say the same shit as ace when he left Alabasta as well</br>  <br>my bad<br><br> CP0 is MOST of Dragon's subordinates(not all because then it wouldn't be a perfect mirror!) <br><br> they're MOSTLY conspiring against Sabo for working with Dragon's persona as a revolutionary(not all of them. Bunny Joe is cool) </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fujitora for next Strawhat</br>  <br> a correlation exists <br> therefore, a trend exists and will continue <br><br>You realize Ace was killed by Blackbeard and the Marine, right? And that CP9 had nothing to do with this? So by the 'muh parallels' logic CP0 should also have nothing to do with Sabo?</br></br></br></br>    <br>You keep putting words in my mouth.<br>I did not clack Dressrosa was a perfect mirror of Alabasta.<br>I did not claim that most of the revolutionary army are spies for WG.<br>I did not claim that "most" of São's underlings will betray him.<br><br>Sabo departure was a rather perfect mirror though, stating what Ace did verbatim.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You keep putting words in my mouth. <br>YOU asked me to elaborate<br><br> Sabo departure was a rather perfect mirror though, stating what Ace did verbatim. <br><br>has nothing to do with CP0. Not a thing</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop replying to bait holy shit</br>  <br>You are still relying on straw man after straw man. You realize that Laffite was in talks with WG shown on panel at the shichibukai meeting before Ace was killed and that Teach was Ace's crew mate for years and years before he back stabbed his friend Thatch, right?</br>  <br>then fucking talk to me asshole i'm bored</br>  <br>how's the wife?</br>  <br>There's literally a watermark anon.</br>  <br><br>Was Fujitora always blind from birth or did he get blinded in both eyes by the [swordsman?] who gave him that scar?</br></br>  <br>It's likely we'll learn of Fujitoras past in Wano.</br>  <br>Seems stupid for Ceasar to be valuable in the black market.<br><br>All he has is his bounty or whatever Big Mom's willing to pay. Not everyone can give him an island and the chemicals for Cesar to make SMILES for them. Unless Oda really wants Big Mom and Kaido to fight, Ceasar is not that important and I don't believe Capone has any interest in him besides obeying someone else's orders.</br></br></br>  <br>Did you forget that he built a nuke BEFORE he had smiles or any real supplies? Dude is still the second smartest character introduced after vegapunk, even without a lab. Plus Big Mom and Kaido seem like the two people most likely to be able to actually give him the stuff he needs. Which isn't to say that Capone isn't working for Big Mom, he probably is.</br>  Was Doffy Tsuru's boytoy?  <br>Have they ever met or interacted at any point in the story?</br>  <br>I want speedreaders to leave</br>  <br>Wait, I forgot, they met once right after Croc was deposed.<br><br>Still a weird as shit pairing</br></br></br>  <br> animefags </br>    <br>She also pursued his crew during Law's flashback. Do you even read, anon?</br>  <br>Still not entirely correct, stop being a speedreader.</br>  <br>Jesus Christ, look at these panel layouts and posing. I completely forgot how awesome these were. What happened? All of New World feels so flat and simple compared to this...</br>  <br>This. That water weakness reveal. Such an epic fight. Such a page turner. AAAAHHH.</br>  <br>I forgot about that too, although in fairness to me they never were actually shown interacting.</br>  <br>I disagree, I'd say his crew treats him way more as a captain this arc. They always asked his permission to do things. Franky with the dwarves, Sanji with Big Mom.<br><br>Stop being a powerlevel fag that thinks character development = fighting skill.<br><br>The only true disappointing fight was Diamante, and maybe Burgess. Even Picas actions were on par with his character because in the chapter we learned about his voice, Doffy told him the battle would decide who would be king, that's why he targeted King Riki and challenged his ideals.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is tsuru his aunt?</br>  Who else should i add to this?  Vizanon is MIA  <br> Kuma <br> Croc <br> abandoned <br><br>What?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sure</br>  <br>Kuma will never be explained.</br>  Does anyone else feel like Kaido is a good guy? Or at least a fallen good guy like one of those Raoh/Toguro scenarios?<br><br>I think him, Rogers, and Raleigh are like Sanji, Zoro, and Luffy. They've already shown Shanks can look like a devil to other pirates that don't know him.</br></br>  <br> Oda is still getting only 2-3 hours of sleep per night. <br>Oda goddammit, stop it. Wasn't the entire point of his last hiatus so he could get out of that habit?</br></br>  <br> kuma <br> crocodile <br> roger <br>roger is dead and still we get the flashbacks of him from rayleigh <br>croco has been shown a lot throughout the series and he is still a prominent character<br>kuma is the same</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What about him needs an explanation?</br>  <br>You are kidding, right?</br>  <br>What's the Sanji abandoned plotline? <br><br>And how is Morgan still relevant? <br><br>Also what's abandoned about Kuma and Croc?<br><br> And I don't even recognize the redhat mustache man or purple hair guy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Surely all high tier pirates are devils to their enemies.</br>  <br>For being the wise man he is it surprises me that he's previously so unable to see the pure goodness in Luffy, despite his being a pirate.</br>  <br>Alvida.</br>  <br>The guy with speed and claws from ussop island</br>  <br>No.<br><br><br>Is with Buggy</br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah I get the feeling that all the yonko are chill and only have skirmishes for appearances <br><br>Hell Big Mom is probably really reasonable besides the people eating thing. Kaido may just be a big friendly gorilla who happens to like fisticuffs</br></br></br>  <br>I think it's because he's too strong in the water that he's waiting so long to let him join. If he just let someone as strong as Luffy join off the bat it'd break his Luffy fighting the main villian every arc since Jinbe could crush them.<br><br>As for Akainu I agree, him and Kinnemon are probably the only ones who could beat Akainu with their skills, Kinnemon being with firesealing. (Unless they say fuck it and just like Zoro damage him with Haki like they did with Marco)</br></br></br>  <br> And I don't even recognize the redhat mustache man or purple hair guy. <br> the first time we see what the grand line is all about is not worth remembering <br> the first time zoro shows his devotion to luffy is not worth remembering  <br> fucking roger is not worth remembering </br></br></br></br>  <br>Morgan not being relevant is the point.<br>Kuma's whole deal with the marines is never explained, along with his entire backstory.<br>I added crocodile as a bonus hilarious joke.</br></br></br>  <br>Kumas backstory will come during the revolutionary arc or the Vegapunk arc, be patient anon</br>  <br>To be honest, I kind of feel like Fujitora is going to join. If not now than later.<br><br>I only say that because if Aokij joined blackbeard, it's only fair that the rivaling crews both get an ex marine. <br><br>(I'm still hoping Hajrudin is next strawhat)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What we know:<br>Kuma is a warrior priest for the revolutionary army.<br>Kuma apparently made a trade accepting brain death and use as a WG Weapon as the cost.<br>Dragon allowed this.<br>Anon it just doesn't make sense.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Haki was an asspull later in the series and you know it. He just kind of said "Okay, the seamonster Shanks intimidated and the listening ability on Sky Island is part of this new system I'm introducing. Everyone accept it because it was there all along"</br>  <br><br>It was obvious that something like haki had to exist. There's no way you can let logias run around unchecked like that and have people like shanks be remarkable without some type of ability.</br></br>  <br>It's ok because Oda is the king of asspulls.<br><br>Eg: This guys was invented to explain how the door higuma kicks off in the 1st chapter is repaired a few pages later. He is a carpenter who cannot let any building go unrepaired.</br></br></br>    Kuro is alive with an active bounty and is the second smartest man in the world. The first is Benn Beckman. Kuro will return.    <br>That's Roger? I never watched the Anime. He looks nothing like he does in the manga.<br><br>Who is the purple haired faggot though? I want to say Don Krieg but I pictured him differently as well. Plus there's no reason for him to be relevant either.</br></br></br>  <br>CP0<br>Big Mom<br>Bartolomeo's BIG SUITCASE <br>Sabo<br>Koal's it'd be dangerous to luffy</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They didn't tell Kuma that they'd be replacing his brain, he joined the shichibukai as a spy, agreed to become a weapon for reasons that aren't explicitly stated but easily guessable (get stronger/get more info, etc), and then had the deal altered to destroy his brain when he couldn't disobey</br>  http://strawpoll.me/4983818/<br>Which saga is the best?</br>  <br>What if he's a member of CP 1-8</br>  <br> my master plan <br> pretend to be a butler for years <br> to have a chance at some small town hick girl's money <br> instead of just killing her, forging a few documents and taking the money </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I figured as much. But it still seems lazy to introduce it so much later in the series.<br><br>Maybe he could have done a system where the fruit users had to take eachother out or something where they have to figure out clever ways to hurt the Logia like Luffy did with Crocodile.<br><br>Frankie beams Blackbeard and GG. Jinbei waterlogs Akainu. Kizamuro is beaten by mirrors or something. Fuck if I know. I didn't think it'd just turn to Dragonballz where strongest wins instead of figure out how to beat the opponents.<br><br>Though I guess if they used cleverness and their powers to beat eachother, it'd just be Jojo's bizarre adventure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that intelligence list was created during east blue when there were like 30 characters. Vegapunk is likely the smartest man in the world. And Benn Beckman is more "wise" than "smart."</br>  <br> if they used bullshit made up on the spot and never mentioned again to win fights it would be jjjba <br><br>I'm sure you meant to say that.</br></br></br>  <br>Because they only wear the mask when they can be recognized by their target. They wore masks on Dressrosa, but Doffy talked to the leader after Marineford and he was unmasked, proving this.</br>  <br> Though I guess if they used cleverness and their powers to beat eachother, it'd just be Jojo's bizarre adventure. <br><br>You whine about asspulls, yet use Jojo as a comparison?</br></br></br>  <br>kuro Is the name</br>  <br>We don't have any clue if the guy Doffy talked to was related to CP0. They wore similar hats and that's about it.</br>  <br>Oda was an assistant on Kenshin so you'd have to be retarded to believe he didn't plan haki all along and foreshadow and even use it under varying names before he revealed it to the protagonist.</br>  <br>best movie right here</br>  <br> Haki was an asspull </br>  <br><br>Because introducing gears and haki and awakening on the spot to make up for the fact Oda way overpowered something like Logia users is much better.</br></br>  <br> abondened plot <br> One Piece </br></br>  <br>Gears after 2 and Haki weren't introduced on the spot, and the author actually remembers that they exist and how they work, so yes, it's way better than JJBA. Awakening is too early to tell, but if it's never mentioned again then it will be tied with JJBA, which does the same goddamn thing more than once.</br>  <br>the explain the florian triangle monsters</br>  <br>According to a letter send from Miura to SK forums, we are at the 70% of the story.</br>  <br>Dressrosa was more about the plight and danger of the country itself, I feel.</br>  <br>this was a plot? when?</br>  <br>Ok. Please adopt a trip.<br>Doflamingo commanded Pacifista when he attempted to assassinate Moira for someone "higher up" than Sengoku.<br>Then met hat guy who demanded to know why he failed.<br>Then on Dressrosa it is hat guy with a mask and CP0 has tricked Akainu at Doffy command.<br> Doffy carrying out assassination of Shichibukai for WG. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Awakening has already been mentioned a few times. Chopper awakened his fruit every time he goes monster mode.</br>  <br>since it was now</br>  <br>just drawn to make the background look eery</br>  <br> don't hear of haki until 500+ chapters in <br> everyone and there dog has it now <br> expects us to believe people like Shanks, Crocodile, Ace, Arlong, Buggy, any of the CP9, Garp, anyone in Alabasta, any of the marines like smoker, anyone on Sky Island despite already having Mantra, or anyone else for that matter used Haki other than possibly Shanks and the listening haki on Sky Island despite alot of them being in legendary groups like Roger's crew, Fisher Tiger's crew, white beard's crew <br><br>You're a fucking retard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nothing is ever abandoned in OP, even the gaimon and sarfunkel gag took 600 chapters to be revealed</br>  <br>Introducing a huge threat and mystery and then ignoring it is abandoning a potential plot line.</br>  <br>That's nowhere near enough to say that they're the same person, because, again, the only connection between the two is 'similar hat'.</br>  Reminder that this is the reason why Doflamingo is deathly afraid of Tsuru.  <br>it was not an asspull simply because it was already introduced in Skypia</br>  <br> Because introducing gears and haki and awakening on the spot to make up for the fact Oda way overpowered something like Logia users is much better. <br><br>That you're stupidly comparing haki to DBZ is retarded enough, but you're compounding your stupidity by using the 'Jojo card' while assuming that OP and Jojo fanbases are so far removed, that someone wouldn't notice this, it does nothing but make you look like a complete faggot. <br><br>If you just want to man up now and admit that you were spouting bullshit and bating to cover up for the fact you didn't know what the fuck you're talking about, feel free to.<br><br>That said, Luffy's Gears were fleshed out enough that by the time Gear 4 was introduced it feels like a natural progression from what came from Luffy's imaginative way of using what's available to him (especially considering his devil fruit). As for Awakenings, they were introduced during Impel Down, only with Doffy finally showing what a non-Zoan version looks like. As a whole, it's not enough has been shown to fairly judge Oda's usage of 'Awakening', so calling it an asspull, at this point, is fucking stupid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Then met hat guy who demanded to know why he failed. <br> Then on Dressrosa it is hat guy with a mask and CP0 has tricked Akainu at Doffy command. <br><br>If anything, this seems to indicate they're different people, because the first guy wants to know why Doffy didn't follow orders, while the second guy is following Doffy's orders.</br></br></br></br>  <br>potential means it never was a real plot line</br>  <br>It is if no one has it or knows it by name and now everyone has it and knows it by name including previous characters who didn't even reference or use it. If Shanks knocked out the bandits, then it wouldn't be an asspull.</br>  <br>Alabasta had a war between its own citizens orchestrated by Baroque Works.<br><br>The civil war occurred before Luffy defeated Crocodile. Don't you remember Vivi almost averted it but infiltrators in her royal army shot Koza?<br><br>It was much more dramatic and realistic than the birdcage and the fighting continued for a little even after Luffy made it rain by KOing Crocodile. Vivi screamed and screamed finally ending it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>BB referred to haki by name in Jaya. He even said that he was surprised how small Luffy's bounty was when his haki was so powerful.</br>  <br>I was comparing the fact that they made people go from shit like Rubber man, Chopchop man, Slipman, etc as the main fighting style to WHO IS THE STRONGEST to dragonballz. You can't say it isn't. It's no different than when Yuyu hakashu got rid of psychic style fighting to just see who has the strongest powerlevels.</br>  <br>Morgan is done, he showed up in Coby's story and again in Django's. There's no reasonable way for him to be relevant again<br><br>Only character's Oda has ditched are Kuro and his cat underlings, all the Krieg pirates, Chessmarimo and Enel's priests. You could include Foxy but he's exactly the kind of gag villain Oda loves and I'm sure he'll find a way back. Everyone else has gotten some kind of callback or reference.</br></br></br>  <br> That said, Luffy's Gears were fleshed out enough that by the time Gear 4 was introduced it feels like a natural progression from what came from Luffy's imaginative way of using what's available to him (especially considering his devil fruit). As for Awakenings, they were introduced during Impel Down, only with Doffy finally showing what a non-Zoan version looks like. As a whole, it's not enough has been shown to fairly judge Oda's usage of 'Awakening', so calling it an asspull, at this point, is fucking stupid. <br><br>This.<br><br>Even Luffy 'solution' to G4's weakness of just pumping Gear 3rd into it screams like some shit Luffy would do, which what makes it fucking hilarious this is what finished Doffy off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Obviously, but she's quite old so she's not likely to be a threat other than her fruit.</br>  <br>Is Nen an asspull because Kite didn't use it in chapter 1 to save Gon?</br>  <br>Jokes are boring if retold. Foxy won't come back</br>  <br>You realize that Gear 4 just turns Luffy into a giant rubber ball, right? How is that not rubberman powers?</br>  <br>Yea the thing is you are wrong they are "both" directly tied to Doffy and work in a high up WG position.<br>Which means it is pretty likely the same person in a canon where non navy hats are mostly unique and the main character literally is called by the hat he wears.</br></br>  <br>He used haki as "willpower" there. He was referring to Luffy just taking a beating from Bellamy and still believing in Skypeia.</br>  <br> she's not a threat if you take out what's threatening about her <br>are you okay anon</br></br>  <br>Because Zoro can ships and mountains in half.</br>  <br>Mihawk did that in chapter 40something</br>  <br>It is, but for other reasons.<br>I still somehow like it.</br></br>  <br>Not him but he also referred to it in Impel Down</br>  <br> it's an asspull if you disregard all the things that doesn't make it an asspull !!!!!!! </br>  <br>I figured the second mate of Krieg that Sanji fought would eventually make a name for himself and fight Sanji like they promised ;_;</br>  <br>That's the reason it got lost in translations, but the word "haki" IS used.</br>  <br> You can't say it isn't. <br>It isn't. It is still completely possible that a fruit user can beat a strong haki user. See Law vs Vergo. Luffy vs Doffy also was not decided by who had the strongest haki or anything like that. There are no powerlevels in One Piece, period.</br></br>  <br><br> asspull <br> introduced in the very first chapter <br><br>Yeah... about that....</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hence why I said 500 plus chapters</br>  <br>nottothisoshittoagain.jpg</br>  <br>It was first explicitly mentioned and used when Shanks knocked everybody out on WB's crew in 434.</br>  <br><br>Seems pretty obvious to me that they're the same. Doffy "followed" orders, but he also didn't give a shit about the repercussions of not completing them or talking back. They followed his orders on Dressrosa because he's blackmailing them<br><br>Not to jump on you two in particular but I really hate this small subset of fans who refuse to believe anything until its stated literally in the manga. Sabo was alive, Kuzan was with Blackbeard, this guy is CP0, Capone is by all the evidence we have on Big Mom's ship. Why ignore the information given because "it might not be"?</br></br></br></br>  <br> See Law vs Vergo. <br><br>Law used haki to defeat Vergo.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm saying it's not proven to be true.</br>  <br>I'm sure if they introduce Stands next chapter, then within 50 chapters everyone has them and Oda tries to say he already did stands at one point and it's what makes Sanji's legs hot, you'd try to justify it as not an asspull.</br>  <br><br>We already know what makes Sanji's legs hot, though.</br></br>  <br><br>Didn't he get poisoned saving Sanji's life?<br><br>Plus I just don't see Krieg attempting to go through the Grand line after getting his ass kicked by Mihawk twice, then by Luffy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If Oda can find a way to make it internally consistent and not contradict anything in the story, then it's not an asspull. Do you think an asspull just means 'a new power is introduced'?</br>  <br>Okay. 434 chapters is when it actually comes into existence which is still a long fucking time and an asspull. My bad. It wasn't really explained until Shabondy though around 500 chapters in.</br>  <br> Lucky Roo fast steps so fast in the panels it is like he fucking teleported when he shoots bandit. <br>For years people speculate Roo as fastest in the world.<br>The first Haki shown was CoO, it is how Shanks found Luffy.<br>The second is CoC, when Shanks glares at a sea monster and it runs away. You should swim in central CA pacific and give a great white shark a "intimidating stare" if you think that was not haki.</br></br></br></br>  The fact Luffy mentioned that Garp could hurt him even though he's rubber multiple times was an indicator of CoA haki early on.  <br><br>No. "A new power that tons of people have and all the strongest use that nobody really talked about until a 434" is an asspull. Doesn't matter how he tries to justify it.</br></br>  <br>Just because something isn't explicitly introduced in chapter 1 doesn't make it an asspull. All haki does is take a bunch of pre-existing powers that weren't explained and give them one. That's not an asspull, it's not even a retcon,</br>  <br> Oda draws a mysterious high ranking government official with a distinctive hat and purposefully hides his frontside <br> 120 chapters later <br> Oda draws a mysterious high ranking government official with a distinctive hat and shows his frontside <br> its somehow not the same guy <br>I appreciate a skeptic but c'mon. Unless there's another leading Cipher Pol agent with an identical hat its the same person</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Blackbeard uses the phrase Haki back in Jaya, he said he knew Luffy's Haki was too great for a 30 million bounty, it was just translated normally back then.</br>  <br>no, he just sliced him inside his room</br>  <br> and an asspull <br>holy shit just fuck off already</br></br>  <br>That was typical anime bullshit. HE'S SO STRONG HE STARED DOWN A SEAKING!<br><br>That's another point that he turned it into Dragonballz basically.<br><br>Somehow Shanks, one of the four Yonko lost his arm to a seaking. But he couldn't use any Haki to beat it, just let it take his arm, didn't attempt to kill it, etc. Yet somehow Luffy at the beginning of the series when he sets off punches it in the face and knocks it out. <br><br>One Piece wasn't supposed to just turn into a muscle flexing contest where everyone is superman tier. It was supposed to be about powers and shit then it diverged.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How could Luffy damage a spring man who is Springs instead of Blades like Mr. 1?  <br><br>It's actually the opposite. He was shocked that with his current level that he was even worth 30m, much less 100m. It was in the aftermath of him knocking out bellamy</br></br>  Smoker is pretty much done for as a rival figure. He is currently far away from Luffy and arriving at Vegapunk's in a few days, that translates to hundreds of chapters, next time he'll show up will probably be when our main characters meet Vegapunk. By then Luffy will be even more magnitudes stronger than Smoker, worse Smoker is still healing his wounds, so he can't even hope of training.  <br> chapter 1 <br><br>yeah, chapter 10 maybe. Maybe after Arlong Park that'd be cool?<br><br>But 434 chapters... Come on now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The justification is what makes it not an asspull. If something new was introduced WITHOUT any justification, then it would be an asspull. Do you not have any idea what the terms you use mean?<br><br>An asspull is something a character, y'know, pulls out of their ass to win a fight. That sure as fuck doesn't apply to haki.</br></br></br>  <br> Somehow Shanks, one of the four Yonko lost his arm to a seaking. <br><br>Maybe because he wasn't a Yonkou back then? Shit, a year in OP can get you an assload of power. Look at where Luffy has gotten in 2.</br></br></br>  <br> Blackbeard didn't chase/attack Luffy till he BTFO a man made of springs with a punch <br>He chased Luffy so fast too, considering Luffy sprinted all the way back and they immediately set sail but were still almost overtaken</br></br>  <br> No. "A new power that tons of people have and all the strongest use that nobody really talked about until a 434" is an asspull. Doesn't matter how he tries to justify it. <br><br>This from the guy who seriously try to defend throwing around the term 'asspull' by using Jojo's Bizarre Adventure as in a series 'where there are no unexplained powers' and 'everyone fights cleverly, not unlike DBZ'.<br><br>Since you're not going to apologize and own up to the your own faggotry, I'm going to disregard your statements (which have been repeatedly refuted easily) as shit-posting.<br><br>To that end, calling something you're too daft to understand an asspull, does not an asspull make.<br><br>It just means you have really shitty reading comprehension.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are talking toys an asspull because they weren't introduced until 702? Even if haki had never been used once before in the series and Oda didn't retcon other stuff into being haki, it still wouldn't be an asspull just because it was introduced a while in.</br>  <br>Super strength has been a part of every strong character's power set since forever, was there any powerful guy that didn't have super strength?<br>Crocodile and Enel probably come closest.</br></br>  <br> Somehow Shanks, one of the four Yonko lost his arm to a seaking <br><br>Stop being a powerlevel faggot. It was either stop the seaking or save Luffy, there was no time for both.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I remember reading somewhere that Oda didn't want Shanks to lose an arm, one of his editors made him do it. I guess it gets a pass since it was so early on and Oda had no idea OP would get so big.<br><br>"Oda had no intention that Shanks lost his arm, but after an editor told him that the story was not interesting enough, Oda decided to cut his arm off. ONE PIECE Grand Countdown 2 (2010)"</br></br></br></br>  <br>But he somehow had swordfights with Mihawk before he lost his arm?</br>  <br>What makes Sanji's leg hot is similar to Okama Kenpo and Bon Kurei's spinning kicks<br><br>The difference between 400 or so chapters of haki appearing hear and there and your example is that the former has appeared in the first 400 chapters here and there and your example comes from your dumbass. Cherry picking is for idiots, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Devil Fruits were introduced.</br>  <br>Before anyone speculates that Mihawk and Shanks weren't big deals back then, Whitebeard remarked that their duels were legendary, so Shanks most definitely was strong as hell before he met Luffy.</br>  <br><br>Yeah it does seem strange that a Yonkou would be just chilling out in the East Blue and no one would comment on it.</br></br>  <br>That was a good call.</br>  Holy shit and I thought all those underaged retards who keep misusing the word "asspull" only crawl out of their shitholes on chapter release days  <br>And yet somehow a seaking that Luffy one punched chapter one took his arm.<br><br>Don't give me that he didn't have time or he bet it on the new generation shit either, we know it's just a fuckup on Oda's part.</br></br></br>  <br> we know <br>no, fuck off</br></br>  <br>This came out in 2000, and this light novel contained material Oda cut from Loguetown so that he could enter the Grand Line at chapter 100, so Haki would have popped up around 100.<br>"If you've ever read the light novel adaptation upon which Oda collaborated on, there was a scene where a fortune-teller who reads people's faces reveals to Luffy that he has the 'Sign of King's Ambition'. Lit. 覇王の相. This is interesting because in Japanese fortune-telling there is the Sign of the Emperor 帝王の相　and the palm-reading 覇王の手相 most commonly known as the 覇王線 or 'Line of King's Ambition' is specifically meant for palm-reading. This means the term was probably created uniquely for this scene."<br>http://apforums.net/showthread.php?<wbr>t=27758&amp;page=256&amp;p=3139755#post3139<wbr>755</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>They are shitposters but newfags keep replying to them</br>  <br> using insults because you can't make a valid argument <br><br>kek.</br></br></br>  <br>He didn't have time and had to choose between letting Luffy get eaten or sacrifice his arm to save Luffy.</br>   people legitimately mad about the seaking <br>It was the first chapter of a story that's evolved greatly in the past 18 years. Its not a big deal<br><br><br>Imagine if Garp wanted to check on Luffy during the year Shanks was there. The fucking shitshow that would be</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ye. That's not relevant though. We all know Oda was just referencing pirate king.</br>  Did Mihawk have the title of strongest swordsman before Shanks lost his arm, because he refuses to fight him anymore. For all Mihawk knows, Shanks could beat him.  <br><br>Shanks is most likely the most recent addition to the Yonkou before the timeskip.</br></br>  <br>well the word "retard" best describes faggots like you who misuse buzzwords and do not know what their true meaning</br>  <br><br>Since Garp repeatedly "cornered" the Roger pirates... Doesn't that mean Shanks/Garp are likely to have fought in the past?<br><br>Still, it would be fucking hilarious to see two of the strongest fighters dicking about in the East blue.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No you idiot. Have you ever considered the possibility that Higuma was legitimately strong with a low bounty like Blackbeard and ambushed Shanks in a bar full of bystanders, women and children?<br>Then Shanks negotiated his way outside and owed everyone except Higuma who escaped?<br><br>Shanks lost his arm because saving Luffy took all his concentration and he therefore could not defend his own arm.<br><br>Kenshin Himura (a red head swordsman with a scar on his face) falls on his ass when he lands a blow on Seijuro Hiko for the same reason.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kuro is alive with an active bounty and is the second smartest man in the world.  <br> The first is Benn Beckman. <br>First of all, you mean "the east blue", not the world. Second, that sbs was only in reference to the characters who'd been introduced up to that point.</br></br></br>  <br>He had plenty of time. Reread the first chapter. Luffy was about to get eaten and he pulled him back. He could have easily cut it's head off in the way that guy cut the giant snakes head off on Sky Island's flashback. Or if he was actually as strong as Mihawk he could have thrown a slash like Mihawk did.<br><br>Besides, if Haki really existed back then why didn't he just arnament his arm up? :3</br></br></br>  <br>Mihawk refuse to fight Shanks because he lost his good arm, however Oda has stated Shanks didn't lose any power at all, but it would probably leave Mihawk a bad taste since muh swordman code.</br>  <br>"Fought" a cabin boy on Roger's ship? Garp probably just focused on the big shots, Roger, Rayleigh, and Gaban.</br>  <br> Besides, if Haki really existed back then why didn't he just arnament his arm up? <br><br>Yeah, no one has ever bitten through armament before.</br></br></br>  <br>Lol. Just no. Reread chapter one. All of Higuma's got rekt instantly. Higuma got eaten by the seaking and Shanks pulled Luffy back instead of trying to deliver an attack.</br>  <br> :3 </br>    <br>Still, does that mean Mihawk's title is meaningless, nobody ever mentions who won their famous duels, and he won't fight a cripple.<br>How can he claim to be the best if he refuses to fight one of the strongest swordsmen alive?</br></br>  <br> How can he claim to be the best <br><br>When has Mihawk ever called himself the strongest? It's a title given to him. Doesn't mean it's true, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Stop reaching for Straws, you know there was no time.</br>  <br>Luffy had time to punch it out first chapter after it's mouth was already out<br><br>Hell, even Zoro moved faster than a fishman, which are said to be faster than seakings in water.

And how far Shanks had to travel in the one second of time it would have taken for that eel to eat Luffy is unknown except Shanks was on shore.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm saying that during that split second, Shanks swam there and if he attacked the seaking first, Luffy still would have died.</br>  <br> Higuma spent the last 12 years inside the sea king <br> waiting <br> watching <br> planning </br></br></br></br>  <br>He did, not only that he used a speed hack to reach Luffy.</br>  <br><br>Who says he could? Based on observations, people don't typically use all the types of haki.</br></br>  <br>There's a Bible story like that.</br>  <br>Post the very next page. He pulled Luffy backwards before it got him.<br><br>Also he had two master shots on his team, his first mate and Usopp's father. Why couldn't they do anything?<br><br>inb4 HURR DURR EVERYONE WAS LOST<br>If they had observational haki it wouldn't be a problem</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because back then even a smoke bomb let the bandit get away from Shanks, observation haki wasn't on Odas mind back then.</br>   there are still people who believe that covering yourself in armament haki makes you invulnerable to sharp objects   <br><br>But who said they had observational haki? We don't even know if they have it in the story as is.</br></br>  <br>I believe the only reason none consider Mihawk still a runner up for the title is that Shanks is not known nor he consider himself a swordsman, and he probably isn't anyway, people like Shanks, Rayleigh, Kizaru or Fujitora, use a sword but have way more fighting skills and haki/df abilities, even Mihawk stated being the best swordsman is easygame compared to aiming for the PK.</br>  <br>Is the story over? Did I miss something?<br><br>Until the story ends. There is no more One Piece coming out in WSJ, you can not claim something is abandoned because you don't know. You're not the editor, or Oda.<br><br>You're fucking retarded.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's because they are retarded powerlevel faggots that think just because characters like Shanks is a Yonko, means he is also a god.</br>  <br>People that use mangapanda scans are worse</br>  <br>That not true.<br>Both Shanks AND Blackbeard demonstrated at Marineford that they could hide from CoO.<br>So it stands to reason that Higuma might be able to too if he's fast enough to throw smoke against people using practically Goku's instant transmission.<br><br>It does not show how Shanks loses his arm and Higuma not shown eaten and skilled enough to evade a Roger pirate who becomes a Yonko whole crew.<br><br>Dude had a sword though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a impossible, even if she is, Koala would betray CP0 for Sabo.

During noon close all windows and try to make the house as shady as possible.</br>  After what happened during this year's winter, I never want winter to happen again. Fuck winter.    <br>Are Koreans immune to these or does it kill them too?</br>  <br>It will.<br>Seeing how hot this summer is, winter will be extra cold again.</br></br>   tfw 49° <br><br>you niggas know nothing</br></br>  <br>Humid heat is the worst. You're not human.</br>  Winter is much better than summer. In the winter when it gets really cold you can just add layers upon layers or just wrap up in a blanket. There's no end to the amount you can use.<br>In the summer though there's only so much you can shed before you start to break laws. Even in the comfort of your own home it's not like you can shed forever.<br><br>There are a bunch of other things that make it better though. Of course, Autumn/Spring are much better.</br></br></br>  <br>Do koreans die to fans or something?</br>  <br>Koreans have a superstition that having a fan on and pointed at you all night while you sleep can kill you.</br>  <br>That doesn't even make the least bit of sense, but okay.</br>  <br>This makes sense logically but it's not true. It's pretty difficult to stay warm when the temperature's subzero, and it's not like your face and hands are going to be sufficiently covered. Being really sweaty &gt; constantly shivering</br>  <br>Of course it doesn't. But all cultures have some kind of superstition that doesn't make the least bit of sense, yet is widely believed anyway.</br>  BUT WHY SPEND 300$ ON IT YEAH IT LOOKS COOL BUT IT DOESNT EVEN DO ANYTHING YOU CANT HAVE FOR 30$  <br>Nah, get decent gloves and your hands will be fine. Face is a little tricky but a thick hat can cover your ears and you'll be good unless there's heavy windchill blowing at you. If you still got face problems you can wear a skii mask for maximum comfy and warmth.</br>  <br>Pretty sure America doesn't. We just have isolated pockets of conspiratards who believe in inane shit similar to that, nothing widespread.</br>  <br>Yeah I don't get it.<br><br>Like in Winter when it's 27°c in my room I'm dying too hot open the windows. <br><br>In summer I set my AC to 27°c aka 80F and I'm cold. Probably the way AC works since it blows colder air and it hits me directly. But the thermostats in my room show 27°c. <br><br>Whats even more funny i'm feeling 27°c as cold while it's 40°c outside.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do people have more free time in summer ?<br>The whole summer thing is stupid as fuck, you can go online everyday</br></br>  <br>That and you can use hand-warmers if you really don't want to wear gloves.</br>  <br><br><br><br>What i really hate about winter is having to leave a warm and cozy place and head out into the cold and when you start sweating under all those clothes even if its cold outside</br></br></br></br>  <br> heavy windchill  <br>which there is<br>always</br></br></br>  <br>It's a lot easier for high schoolers and college students to post 24/7</br>  <br>I know exactly what you mean. It's like trying to fall asleep. Take off some layers, too cold now. Put them back on, now you're sweating again.</br>  <br> you start sweating under all those clothes even if its cold outside <br><br>If only you could take off your coat</br></br></br>  <br> mfw the warmest place here is -35 degrees celcius <br>Kill me</br></br>  <br>Where do you live, Mars?</br>  <br>vostok station medic</br>  <br>And then freeze to death in seconds, yeah, fuck that.</br>  <br><br>Get a really warm scarf. Like real wool, not the synthetic stuff. My mother knitted me a hat and scarf, and I can't even wear it often during the winter, because it's so thick and warm. I get like a weeks worth out of it a year, but it's worth it if I ever need to walk anywhere really far or stand out in the cold for long time.<br><br><br>Shouldn't you be researching at your research base in Antarctica instead of shitposting?</br></br></br></br></br>     mfw it hits around/over 30°c   <br><br>But it's the ice cream of the future.</br></br>  <br>How the fuck do these things work?</br>  <br>KERO KERO KERO KERO</br>  <br>Take a picture outside your window</br>  <br> yfw allergies are actually a result of an over-active immune system <br> yfw an over-active immune system is probably an adaptive trait to inhibit parasites and infections <br> yfw we're actually genetically superior, we just live in too clean of a world now. </br></br></br>  <br>It's 34C where I am right now.

You can get either of those second-hand for cheaper than $50 now. It'd probably cost more for both games than it would a console to play them on.</br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit wait, Geji-Nee in C;H? The same one from R;N? I vaguely remember reading something about Geji-Nee, but it didn't seem all that important.</br></br>  <br>Are you unable to read the picutere?<br>Silverfish-sis -&gt; Geji-nee.<br><br>It was all planned from the start.</br></br></br></br>  <br>"Silverfish-sis", as seen in that anon's screencap, is a mistranslation of "Geji-nee".</br>  <br>Onoe naked in fetal position is something I need more of.<br><br><br>I wonder, how long will it take for Chaos;Child to get as much attention as Steins;Gate?<br>Or will it be forgotten like Chaos;Head?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some threads ago someone hint about di-swords' form factor.<br>Could they assume another form that is not a sword?<br>As I know, without having played C;C, is a result of an accelerated biorythm, usually originated from really bad situations and a sword is a form to hurt</br></br></br>  <br><br> It was all planned from the start. <br><br>For what purpose? Or does C;C explain it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>What did you think smelled like an ARG?</br>  <br>Well, Rimi's Di-Swords look like an angel's wings.<br><br>So there might be some variation but it will always form a sword.<br><br> For what purpose? <br> To make money for 5pb. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chaos;Head anime is still loved by casuals who know no different, and was pretty big for a while after it aired. Hopefully, Noah's official release will revive its brief popularity, thus shining light on C;C.</br>  <br><br>I wasn't aware that they could have other forms in the first place. Is that a fact or just speculation?</br></br>  <br>Not that anon, but it's speculation, every Di-Sword we have seen thus far was, well, a sword.<br><br>With the exception of Rimi's, whose sword look like an angel's wings, as described by Taku.<br><br>He describes each sword in detail, and you can guess a lot of the character by the description of the sword.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just speculation.<br>If one can violently change biorythm by other means than torture, mental stress, trauma.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I figured that much. If Di-Swords are direct projections of the subconscious, then they'd reflect the wielder. I just wasn't really sure how much I could pull from the sword designs. Take Taku's for example, it could mean anything from being 1 dimensional and focused to not having any embellishments. Designed for a single purpose maybe?</br></br>  <br>It's unimportant now. Just a misunderstanding.</br>  <br>Imagine a Gigalomaniac, who is sexually aroused to the max, about to fuck his girlfriend, unable to find a condom.<br>In his excited and aroused state of mind, he sees something at the edge of his vision.<br>He tries to grab it, and pulls out a  Dirac-Condom .</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know what I should think about his straight and long Di-Sword.<br>I really have no idea what it could possibly mean, yet I'd like to think that it's the simplicity that makes it the best.<br>Maybe I can agree on your "single purpose" statement.</br></br></br>  Time travel exists, in that time dilation exists due to excess of gravity. Unfortunately you can't go back (from our current understanding of physics) but only forward from the present, you just age at a slower rate in the form of seconds to minutes.  <br> not   Dira-Condom </br>  <br><br>It's a sad limitation. What about light from stars and that sort of thing? Aren't they reaching us from the past?</br></br>  <br>Di-Sword is short for Dirac-Sword.<br>So, it should be  Di-Condom. </br></br>  <br><br>You're speaking of the Doppler effect. It's a good read, I suggest checking out the wiki page for if. It's technically not a form of time travel, just radial perspective as we move from the relative source.</br></br>  Anime onlyfag here. Hated Chaos;Head but loved Steins;Gate. Should I watch Robotic;Notes and wait for Chaos;Child anime?  <br>Chaos;Head anime was horseshit. Read the VN.</br>  <br>You should forget everything you know about Chaos;Head, then read the VN, hell read the VN either way.</br>  <br><br>You mean this?</br></br>  <br>Animeonlyfag reporting in.<br><br>R;N started off pretty good but it slipped up near the end. It won't be nearly as good as S;G but it might still be entertaining for you.</br></br></br>  <br>Agreed here, Chaos;Head's VN was a wild ride.</br>    <br><br>I thought the Doppler effect was related to sound? Or is it for anything wave based?</br></br>  <br><br>Please for your own sake read the VN. The anime adaptation of C;H is awful. The R;N anime was mediocre. Not great, but it ties some things together for Sci;Adv later on in the future so it's good to know about.</br></br>  <br>I think he means the name of a book</br>  <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppl<wbr>er_effect<br><br>Pretty sure it's this.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> giant Upa <br>Mayuri must be behind this.</br></br>  I fucking swear S;G fans have got to be even more autistic than any long running shounen. Fact  <br>How?<br>Purely talking about on 4chan of course, almost all anime fans anywhere else are autismo maximi.</br></br>  <br>how mad do you have to be to post this</br>  <br>Welcome to the sciADV thread, shiposter-kun!<br>Now get the fuck out</br></br>   I'd get infected if it meant living in bliss forever, who wouldn't?     <br>Shit, meant to quote </br>  <br><br>At least this roleplaying feels nostalgic</br></br>  I don't even like Rimi, but that goofy-ass smile she has here melts my heart.  <br>He knew what an IBM 5100 was used for before really anyone else did I think<br>But other than that his predictions were wrong, unless, by telling us what was going to happen he prevented the events he said were going to take place.<br>Who knows, its probably all bullshit</br></br></br>  <br>I love Rimi, she is the best girl.</br>  <br>Yeah, definitely watch Robotics;Notes. Just don't expect anything as amazing as Steins;Gate, but in the end you should enjoy it anyway.</br>  <br>Would you fuck Rimi? If so, how? This is a very important question pertaining to how much you really love her.</br>  <br> fucking your waifu <br>This has to be a trick question.</br></br>  <br>Of course the only way to fuck Rimi is to   give her a good tender hand holding.  </br>  I watched this anime and never knew the john titor thing was real. But this makes this post even more mind boggling   <br>I don't seem to get it, nothing of it will happen, what do you mean by that?</br>  <br>I just googled John titor, its a real thing. What the hell; I never realized those were real things. Welp, fuck. I thought you were just sitting me</br>  <br>The whole idea behind SciADV is taking real unexplained events/theories/tales and weaving them into a story.</br>   timeline stuff   <br><br> Not knowing about John Titor <br> Not knowing about the IBN5100 <br> Not knowing about C/SERN <br> Not knowing about Lifters <br><br>What have you been doing with your life?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I see you're from @channel.</br>     making signs for Japanese city level in a game <br> typing random shit into google translate <br> start using anime references <br> "Did you mean: El Psy Kongoo ? <br><br>THIS IS THE WILL OF STEINS GATE!</br></br></br></br></br>  As expected of the Committee.

All it depends on is how willing a reader is willing to accept magical delusion swords as a plot point.</br>  <br><br>No kidding. Limited to particles though.<br><br><br><br>Because the anime adaptation is shit. When people talk about C;H here, they're talking about the VN.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I meant the majority of discussions I've seen involving ranking have had C;H &gt; S;G. If you look at it from a self-insert point of view, it makes sense.</br></br>  <br>Anime was legitimate trash. Most adaptations almost never capture enough of the source material to live up to it, but the C;H anime takes that to another level. It removes entire scenes that are important to the plot, and then goes and adds anime original scenes that go against the tone of the entire VN. On top of that, the animation and art quality are fucking trash.<br><br>The VN is great, but most people on MAL only watch the anime and write off the entire series based on that.</br></br></br>    <br>It hurts to live</br>  <br><br>Dear god, I didn't think the animation could be that fucking hideous. This is a delusion right? I'm dreaming right?</br></br>  <br>There was no animation of C;H. It doesn't exist. It's all in your head.</br>  <br>TFW KuriGohan<br><br>And is this from an episode?</br></br></br>  <br><br>O-oh. Good. I really need to s-stop having these delusions.

Getting a random text could scare the shit out of you.

Operating under this assumption, what would the necessary series to view and what order should they be viewed in? This is all theoretical of course.  <br>I just googled it, all I saw was the 3 naked chicks with patterns on them holding swords and stuff, not even a mecha. If I wanted that kind of fanservice I would have watch Cross Ange</br>  Everything but Gundam Wing is shit.  <br> not even a mecha. <br>There are mecha's and they are also kinda decent, there's also some really, really nice Kaiju shit but the show is overall extremely boring and the writing is pretty fucking bad.<br><br>The animation is schizophrenic, there's a few really good moments, mostly drugin fights and all the rest is basically static faces with moving mouths, the style itself is also very anonymous so it doesn't really help giving a strong impression.<br><br>It's nothing more than a 6/10, if you want a good /m/ watch with gorgeus animation and style from around that period you'd better watch Turn A or The Big O, there's a very good reason fucking nobody remembers Neo Ranga even on /m/.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Really? Sounds like you haven't seen much. <br>Sorry for liking something that you don't. Maybe I didn't word it right; it might not be the best, but it's definitely my favorite.<br><br><br>They don't have any weapons or patterns in the show itself though, nor do they get naked. That's only for promotional material. It's a show about three girls and their giant monster, and it's most definitely /m/. The battles towards the end are insane.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it might not be the best, but it's definitely my favorite. <br>If you put it that way I can't disagree.</br></br></blockquote>]
