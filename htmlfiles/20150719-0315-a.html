[ How will the Big Mom ship encounter turn out?  I hope we scenes like this for the final battle and Luffy's crew being named with their own panels.  <br>Then they get wrecked by the Marines.</br>  <br>Jinbei will come and save them, Kid's alliance will take her down.</br>  I'm positive everyone on the ship jobbed  <br> final battle </br>  <br>Hate to ask to be spoo nfed, but where do I get HQ scans?</br>  <br>Capone seemed to think they were doing well.<br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if Sanji and Brook defeated Pekoms and Tamago; and Caesar blew up the ship.</br></br></br>  <br>I really think Jinbe is too strong in water to be a straw hat. He's 10x stronger than when he fought Ace to a standstill on land. Ace wasn't 10x weaker than Again.<br><br>He can make knock up streams.</br></br></br>  <br>http://kissmanga.com/Manga/One-Piec<wbr>e-Digital-Colored-Comics<br>http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/one-p<wbr>iece-digital-colored-comics-r10004</wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br><br>Than *Akainu</br></br>  <br> Capone seemed to think they were doing well <br><br>He was talking about Luffy and Law.</br></br></br>  <br>batoto<br>batoto coloured scans<br>mangasee<br>vizanons imgur album<br>mangstream.to</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Secret club.</br>  WHY DIDN'T THEY TURN TONTATTAS INTO TOYS IF THEY NEEDED SLAVE LABOR TO HARVEST DEVIL FRUIT?  <br> final battle </br>  <br>they needed proper free will to use their knowledge of plants</br>  <br>Most fights take place out of water luckily. But yes, there is nothing wrong with him being beastly as hell near water. <br><br>He's still a confirmed SH though.</br></br></br>  <br>No need; the tontattas willingly helped them</br>  <br>wat</br>  What do you think will happen in  Monet's  cover story?  <br>He declined, stating he'd join later.<br>This could easily be a death flag for Jinbe.</br></br>  <br>Vergo will save her, then she'll study more astronomy and find Enel through a telescope</br>  <br>It was more like he accepted but delayed it a tiny bit.</br>  <br>Pls</br>  <br>The Tontatta are gullible. That's why they were such easy friends with Norland, but also why the Tontatta princess was voluntarily helping Doffy until Luffy appeared.</br>  I forgot about this snippet but makes sense why Zoro was sent to learn from Mihawk then.  Is this shit with Doffy finally over?<br><br>I stopped reading for a while because nothing was happening for so long.</br></br>  <br>Yes Doffy is defeated we're at the post arc goodness now, news has already been spread and we got dick teased with Kaido henchmen.</br>  <br>luffys 1 hit ko failed, rebecca cut doffy and saved the day</br>  <br>Luffy vs Marine<br> Akainu mortally wound Luffy but Luffy defeat him. <br>A wild Blackbeard appears.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Fuck yeah<br>Time to catch up</br></br></br>  <br> is this shit with Doffy finally over? <br>Yes.<br> so then that must mean things are actually going to start happening in chapters now? <br>Hah.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're gonna reread all of Dressrosa yeah?</br>  <br>Vergo will put himself together, take Monet to dressrosa, get the citizens to heal her, and vow to hunt down the strawhats</br>  These threads have gone to shit<br><br>I'll be back in 2 weeks for spoilers, but god fucking damn<br><br>enjoy your shit.</br></br></br></br>  Koshiro &gt; Mihawk = Shanks<br>Shanks fails the "not cut" test, he has to use the side of his blade to not cut as confirmed at Marineford.<br>Mihawk failed to cut Diamond, since even though he is a graceful swordsman, he still relies on the ultimate destructive blade, what Kushiro said he would not consider a real sword.<br><br>Wado Ichimonji is the true ultimate sword and this is proven by the fact it's the only sword to pass koshiro requisites for ultimate sword.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Wado Ichimonji is the true ultimate sword and this is proven by the fact it's the only sword to pass koshiro requisites for ultimate sword. <br>That's not Shusui</br></br>  <br>It's funny because, at the time, that was translated as *can't cut anything." Now, we know that the context is "can cut nothing." Big difference.</br>  <br> true ultimate <br>Yeah no</br></br>  <br>I agree with you, but I understood it well enough through the bad translation.<br>Like I said, Shanks failed the test. Mihawk too.<br><br>The only blade that has been shown in canon passing the test is Wado Ichimonji while held by Koshiro.<br><br>It's awesome that Zoro already passed the "can cut nothing" part of the test, BEFORE he cut steel.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>are you autistic?<br><br>shanks was blocking akainus fist. if he tried to block with the blade the fist would get cut becauses its ramming into the fucking sword</br></br></br>  <br>What chapter was that? The wiki says he "cut nothing" with the blunt side but I want to verify the claim.<br><br>Even if so, Kenshin was still stronk too.</br></br></br>  <br><br>oh hey, it's sanji<br><br>what happened to him?</br></br></br></br>  So is Sanji the first to achieve his dream? Was Mermaid Cove his All Blue this whole time?  <br>correct answer</br>  Norland's smiling cartoon face is thought to mock him, but really it is proof he is a D. D is not actually a D, it's a smiling face. Gol :D Roger<br>Like that.<br> Hero <br>literally written</br></br></br>  <br>did people even use smilies in 1998?</br>  Is it safe to assume Roger's crew had no devil fruits (Buggy and Shanks were not aware of how they actually work in their flashback on Roger's ship).<br><br>Also Shanks' crew has no devil fruits either?</br></br>  <br>Yes, young man. They did.</br>  <br>I dont know if its safe to assume but its possible?<br><br>Shanks and co intended to sell the one fruit we see them with. Perhaps selling DFs was a thing they did in their spare time. They were more interested in making beer money than having cool powers</br></br></br>  What would an awakened logia do?  <br> I'm 27 <br><br>Well if you say so</br></br></br>  <br>gain the ability to change into a similar logia?<br><br>fire=&gt;magma<br>light=&gt;sound<br>smoke=&gt;mist? smog? a solid maybe</br></br></br></br></br>  The new opening is starting to grow on me.<br><br>Oh god.</br></br>  <br>Hard Knock Days or has that been replaced?</br>  <br>Hard knock days man.<br><br>I used to think it was gay as fuck and skip it <br>But now I cant help but listen to that gay shit.</br></br></br></br>  Fuck man. I need some REVEALS.  GODDAMN I WANT TO KNOW WHAT D MEANS  <br> tfw you can't grow a mustache Gold Roger's </br>  <br><br>It was mentioned that anyone on Rogers ship could eat any devil fruit captured if they wanted to. Judging from the interest in Buggy's fruit it seemed like they didn't really care too much.<br><br>You also have to remember that as a pirate you spend most of your time on the sea, and losing the ability to swim is enough for the majority of the pirates to avoid eating one (Especially if the fruit is unknown), the only reason we don't see shitloads of fodderish DF users drown is because it would be pretty boring and somewhat morbid. <br><br><br><br>If PH is any indicator, they can permanantly change the climate of an island.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Devil <br>Demon <br>Literally god'a natural enemy</br></br></br>  <br>Transform/alter the environment into their element; as seen on Punk Hazard and with Crocodile.</br>  <br> Daring </br>  <br>There is no evidence Shanks intended to sell the Gomu Gomu.<br>Zero.<br>There is evidence against it.<br>For example on the first page of storyline canon (actual page one is a color spread of Luffy and Shanks and many characters in a open area full of treasure, celebrating), a narrator tells us Shanks arrived 1 year ago. We are shown his last night and day at the island.<br>Before docking one year ago, Shanks stole the Gomu Gomu from an enemy pirate ship. A year later, Luffy eats this fruit which was hidden on the red hair's ship.<br>Shanks flips out.<br>Later in the story we are told that BB gave Shanks his scar, that he was a 20 year member of Whitebeard's crew (joined before Roger died but within the same year). <br><br>Shanks hid in East Blue for one year because he invaded Whitebeards ship to steal Gomu Gomu and was scarred by Blackbeard.<br>Blackbeard would only expose his power level to a Roger pirate if it was over something really important.<br>There's no canon that suggests Shanks planned to sell Gomu Gomu. None. That's just your wrong assumption.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The D is linked to the destroyed kingdom 800 years ago, and probably tied to the Poneglyphs.<br><br>When the Ohara scholars were about to reveal the name the Gorosei ordered CP to kill them.<br><br>I would have guessed "Dragon", but "Monkey Dragon Dragon" sounds too retarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> all those bottles of liquor </br>  <br><br>Probably the most obvious options, so I really hope it's not one of those</br></br>  <br> Dee </br>  <br> Shanks hid in East Blue for one year because he invaded Whitebeards ship to steal Gomu Gomu and was scarred by Blackbeard. <br> Blackbeard would only expose his power level to a Roger pirate if it was over something really important. <br> There's no canon that suggests Shanks planned to sell Gomu Gomu. None. That's just your wrong assumption. <br><br>I don't like this. I want the previous owner of the Gomu Gomu to be some village idiot who drowned.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Professor Clover was going to say the name of the Kingdom. We don't know if the name of the Kingdom is the same as what D. stands for, nor if the Kingdom even begins with a D.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, I really hope it doesn't turn out to be "Shanks was holding Rogers fruit".<br><br>Luffy is similar enough to Roger as it is, if they have the same fruit then you might as well give him a mustache and it's the same character.<br><br>Plus it would be far more interesting to have Roger be a badass on pure skill alone.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Openings List From Best to Worst (excluding Opening 7)<br><br>God Tier:<br>1) Kokoro no Chizu (OP 5)<br><br>Top Tier:<br>2) Hikari E (OP 3)<br>3) Fight Together (OP 14)<br>4) One Day (OP 13)<br><br>Good Tier:<br>5) We GO (OP 15)<br>6) Jungle P (OP 8)<br>7) Share the World (OP 11)<br>8) Brand New World (OP 6)<br><br>Okay Tier:<br>9) We Are!

Kind of like how the amazons live on Amazon lilly.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It stands for Davy Jones</br>  <br>What? Are you still salty that Hikari E spoiled Robin for you, anon?</br>  <br> Shit tier <br> Wake Up! <br><br>Anon you're list is shit and you should feel bad.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, it would be terrible writing to put that so late in the series... I really don't see it happening.<br><br>Whitebeard and his crew all saw Luffy fight, and Luffy has interacted with a lot of legends like Rayleigh and Chiango who would have mentioned something about similar powers.</br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Zou will be an arc similar to the Davy Back Fight arc because Oda know when to give his readers a break after long, exhausting arcs.  <br>Roger has only been shown going into battles with a sword and pistol, and presumably haki on top of that.</br>  <br> shit song <br> terrible outfits <br> shit drawing <br> shit animation <br> cheesy dialogue <br><br>Only good things were the Dressrosa parts, and that was only about 30 seconds of the whole thing</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wonder what new fate things Zoro learned from Mihawk.  <br><br>I'm hoping there's a huge amount of buildup for Big Mom, including flashbacks to fights with WB/Roger/Kaido etc... Then she opens the bomb from FI completely destroying her flagship and critically injuring most/all of her crew.</br></br>  <br>He cut apart the ship when he arrived back on Saboady, saying it was fate that he got on it accidentally.</br>  <br>Yeah but that seems like something Zoro would do normally.</br>  <br> fan colored manga <br>Eww no thanks</br></br>  <br>Is this bait?<br>There is nothing to suggest that the ancient kingdom name has a D in it anywhere.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Your loss friend.</br></br></br>  <br><br> pics <br><br>And people still thinks Mihawk &gt; Doffy</br></br></br></br>  <br> dude no one talks about and have never seen him fight is better then people we seen fight and one is the greatest swordman in the world fuck off mate </br>  <br>replied to wrong post. anyway the point is still the same the ancient kingdom could be raftel/lvneel/whatever and it wouldn't require a D.</br>  <br>He is.</br>  in the final fight I bet zoro flashback to Koshiro and not Mihawk. If Koshiro was #1 before Kuina died especially. Who says Koshiro was ever defeated by anyone?    <br>What chapter did that flashback start in?</br>  <br>Chapter 5<br>You'll have to read 90-100 to find the second because I forgot, but when Zoro meets Tashigi and gets two new named swords he has a second. When he fights Daz Bones he has a third.</br></br>  <br>The one I posted isn't a flashback but a cover page showing Koshiro in the present time period.</br>  <br><br>No, All Blue will happen when the redline part of mariejoris and fishniggerisland will be destroyed.<br>Making the four Blue´s flow into one place</br></br></br>  <br>Forgot image</br>  Please, post chapter pages in color.  <br>Even Daz Bones blocked a Mihawk air slash, Luffy dodged a bunch of them, and Crocodile stalled him long enough for Luffy to leave his CoO range.<br><br>And that whole time Oda made us believe Mihawk was serious and trying to kill Luffy. Maybe Koshiro really is better.</br></br></br>  <br> No, All Blue will happen <br>No you don't know anything about it,neither do any of us.Stop forcing your own headcanon into making it a fact because no ones cares about your shitty theories.</br></br>  <br><br>It´s been discussed to death, and most seem to agree it would happen.<br><br>Because of that, it´s without a doubt gonna happen!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't respond to it.</br>  <br>Any general ones you want posted? I've only got like 100 saved.</br>    Who's the qtest character and why is it Roofy?  <br>I want ones like this.</br>   koala will never hotdog yo dik   <br>How the fuck is anyone suppose to fight Sanjuan Wolf?</br>    <br>Do you mean official Oda ones? Or ones with similar events happening on the page?</br>  Robin will never push her sweaty tats on your body.  <br>Official Oda ones.</br>  <br> tats <br><br>Well apart from the one chapter you're posting, Oda hasn't coloured any chapters</br></br></br>  <br> It´s been discussed to death <br>Oh,did you discuss it with oda and editors and they agreed?That's marvelous.</br></br>  <br><br>I was actually talking about the people that kept posting without color, but a color dump is noic too.</br></br>  <br>Shitty, and this chapter was not colored, just those two first pages of it.</br>  <br>It would be cool if in the future, one of the crewmembers has to fight someone in a different archetype and completely floors them through sheer strength difference alone.</br>  <br>Jinbei can handle giants pretty well himself.</br>    When's this asshole gonna show up?  <br>In the final arc</br>  Is the Doflamingo figure worth the extra $40 to pre-order the European special edition of Pirate Warriors 3 or does it look like shit?  <br>Sounds like a very Sanji or Zoro thing to do. Literally just overpower them by being strong.</br>  Do you think Marines will uprise to the WG at the end? Are you expecting a coup d'etat?  <br>Someone shop the Xusasu Basasu and everyone's typeset into this color page. It'd be glorious.</br>  im not sure what the heck was going on in chapter 793<br><br>The navy is angry because Luffy upset the balance of shichibukai or something?</br></br>  <br>Basically, what's not easy to get though? It's all pretty clear.</br>  I'm hoping they managed to get away<br>What I'm expecting is that only like one or two of them got away and everyone else was captured.<br><br>If anything, I'm sure Sanji's being forced to cook for big mom</br></br></br>  <br><br>I can see that happen under akainu's tutelage.<br>He doesn't give a fuck about the WG and wants the marines to be his own tool of justice.</br></br></br>  here is as good a place to post this as anywhere  Why does Oda always pierce your heart by his shit and you start to almost cry?<br> That person they spoke of wasn't some random pirate and he wasn't the cursed offspring of the great pirate era that everyone spoke of, Ace was my brother </br>  So I am reading one piece again and I'm at Skypiea. Here is this scene where Robin talks how the lightning fruit is one of the invincible powers. Is she talking about Logia in general or are there fruits which are considered invincible?<br><br>Also how strong would Enel have been in the grand line?</br></br>  Daily reminder that Law a slut.  <br>I think the line was about the most powerful ones <br>the goro goro is one <br>pika pika is another<br>gura gura <br>and probably the magma one</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Also how strong would Enel have been in the grand line? <br>Oda confirmed that he would have had a 500 million bounty if he were on the blue sea. So New World tier of course.<br><br>Also, I think it's one of the invincible in that the user is very hard to kill perhaps. He did restart his own heart with the fruit after all.<br><br><br>Could also be this; I'd argue Enel's fruit is the best in the series so it could be reference to the overall power of the fruit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only reason Enel lost was because for no real reason he made himself really big and unable to dodge.<br><br>Maybe Oda bumped him out of the plot early on because he's planned out all the biggest powers early on and the lightning one was so strong he needed it out of the way.</br></br></br>  <br> new world tier <br>Yeah, no. Bounty != strength. Enel would get trashed by any top-tier New World Pirate/Marine.</br></br>   big mom showing up already to get jobbed.   <br>yeah, i like to imagine Roger as a beast, no fruit, no weapons, only the good old barehands and his fukking super haki<br><br>Also i want an entire Arc for Roger adventures/flashback (at least the early and the late years)</br></br></br>  <br>I'd like for Roger's flashback to show him as a  horrible criminal who burns down cities and steals fucking everything. <br><br> But I'm aware he'll have to be another good guy who never does wrong. </br></br></br>  <br>Has she been conirmed for battling anyone as of late? I'd love it, if she pulled a Gecko Moria and got a lot weaker for not dong anything for a long time. She's able to keep her position due to her past notoriety, but it's not based on anything anymore.<br>Then her whole crew should job against the SHs on the Sunny.</br></br>  <br>People tend to forget how insanely strong Doffy is.<br>He wasted Law and Luffy while mantaining that stupid birdcage that not even a whole island could stop, including Zoro and Fujitora. Also Gear Fourth Luffy could not finish him even when Law already injured him big time. Doflamingo is fucking strong.</br></br>  <br> brook drinking soda which would dissolve his bones <br> luffy feeding a fish soda which would fucking kill it <br>Robin's hot legs are the only thing that save this pic.</br></br></br>  <br>Obviously Roger will be a  a complete retarded who act before thinking  with enough knowledge and focus to reach raftel.<br><br>Also  final boss is Davy Jones, Admiral of the ancient kingdom, become the keeper of Raftel and One Piece, who is something world gov needs to achieve the complete control of the world </br></br></br>  <br> Told people to blame God <br><br>I thought Zoro is an atheist?</br></br></br>  <br>man, croco is so weak now. luffy can stop his attacks like nothing.</br>  <br> people forget <br>Probably because Dressrosa is so forgettable. I have to keep rereading it because I forget half of it if I don't.<br><br>Oda dropped the fucking ball with this arc its presentation is so boring.</br></br></br></br>  <br>DFs &gt; Haki<br>Enel would destroy people with lightning. No-one is immune to it but Luffy in the world.</br></br>  <br>Everyone is forgetting that Enel has the most advanced form of Kenbunshoku Haki seen so far.</br>  <br>Implementing his DF power into it really is unique. I can't wait how he applies niggermode into it.</br>  <br>dont read it through mangapanda if you are. if you arent, dont see what's so hard to understand</br>  <br> Probably because Dressrosa is so forgettable. I have to keep rereading it because I forget half of it if I don't. <br>No it's not, it's just that when you read weekly you forget events much quicker due to a certain amount of things taking 2 years, while with every other arc you got to experience the whole thing in a continuous hit.</br></br>  <br>Because any NW pirate/marine can do something about Enel's god-tier CoO and speed of light.</br>  <br> he becomes black with lightning powers </br>  <br> Because any NW pirate/marine <br><br>Why do people say this sort of thing about 'all' nw denizens when the majority of them, including crews, seem no more stronger than most of what we've seen before? There's just a few captains and things who are strong. Their crews are still the same jobbers.</br></br></br>  <br>Fujitora also likely does a similar thing with his gravity to advance his CoO.<br><br>Exactly (correction though; speed of lightning =/= speed of light, but it's still a fucking massive velocity which would be comparable in the OPverse)</br></br></br>  <br> I have to keep rereading it because I forget half of it if I don't. <br>or maybe it's cause you're dumb. one refresh should be enough to remind you or keep up with things, only because it's so long.</br></br>  <br>This.<br>I would forget about some things from Impel Down, Marineford, Fishman Island and Punk Hazard as well. <br>It's kind of sad we'll always have newfags whining about whatever current arc is, no matter how good it may be.</br></br></br>  <br>You realise that Zoro, Usopp, Sanji and Robin survived his lightning, right ? Just CoA up and block that shit.</br>  You guys think Law will the be next Straw hat? Here is my thought:<br><br>Oda always tells the sad backstory of a character before they join the Straw hats. It's always been like this and now we have seen Law's. <br>You guys think there is any correlation with that?</br></br></br>  <br>People survive every DF, however Enel's is one that's highly effective at incapacitating people.<br><br>Haki wont block out lightning by the way.</br></br></br>  <br>Because the crew got stronger too ? I feel like it's relative. The crew fought fodder before but that same fodder would be dust in the NW. The fodder in the NW would be semi-successful in the Grand Line.</br>  <br>What role could he fill though?<br><br>I've been saying this for ages: the strawhats need a cook</br></br></br>  <br>Law has his own crew, but they can die, or he can give command to someone else. It's possible.<br> Kaido or Big Mom massacre Law's crew <br> Law seeks revenge again </br></br></br>  <br>We've seen bunch of non-crew members having flashbacks. By that logic Hody Jones should be a member already.</br>  <br>Surgeon.<br>Chopper is a great doctor, but can he perform surgery?</br></br>  <br> Oda always tells the sad backstory of a character before they join the Straw hats <br>Senor Pink/Baby5 for next nakama!</br></br>  <br> Implying that Zoro is not a God. </br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>I preferred the translation "Blame it on a quirk of fate."</br>  <br> Haki wont block out lightning anyway <br>You base this on absolutely nothing. If Haki can block fucking Light and Magma, it sure as shit can block Lightning. <br><br>Also, the NW people are obviously going to be a lot tankier than the Grand Line people. We have no idea if someone with Doffy's endurance would be incapacitated at all. Shit, he didn't fall unconscious after getting his insides scrambled.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I would not even be mad.</br>  <br>Proof?</br>  <br>Zoro doesn't really have a role except being the badass sword fighter does he? Law could just be another fighter because they need one. And his surgery skills are needed. Chopper can't do every thing by himself. Not the kind of surgeries Law can handle.</br>  <br>Post yfw Zoro is revealed to be an ancient deity based around anger and carnage.<br>Pic related.</br></br>  <br>When has haki blocked light? Not in the sense of Rayleigh using it on his sword; but if Kizaru shot a beam of light at you, your haki on your body wouldn't defend that. Especially when haki like Vergo's can't even block out Law's ability</br>  <br>Zoro's just the Swordsman, yea.</br>  <br>That would be such a pain. He's been emo for long enough now, I want to see him enjoy life for once.</br>    <br><br>it's not really official but he fits the role as the first mate.</br></br>  <br>There's more required to become a crewmate than just a sad backstory.<br>You need:<br> Goal which requires travelling the seas <br> Sad backstory <br> A general role they can take (which is either wanted by Luffy or necessary I'd say) <br>Jinbei for instance has it all, which is why he's confirmed to join.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm not talking about how every one who had a backstory joined the straw hats. But every straw hat that did, had a backstory before joining.<br><br>Just a thought that popped into my head.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The same way the user can be blocked, I suppose. I'm not saying it will negate the attack. I'm saying you can put up a defense, since Enel's lightning seems more similar to Magma than Light for whatever reason. And we really haven't seen anyone use CoA for defense against Kizaru, so I suppose I'm being baseless too. That's my bad.</br>  <br>Like an Archaelogist!</br>  <br> Kaido or Big Mom kill Law <br> Law's crew joins Luffy <br>A whole bunch of new nakamas is better than one.</br></br></br>  <br>Robin does have a dream though. It's to discover the true history of the world.</br>  <br> implying they don't need an archaeologist for reading the poneglyphs </br>  <br>Robin is indeed necessary for finding One Piece. Luffy is lucky that his fate lead her to joining.</br>  <br>but they could also have that backstory introduced later in the series. like robin. so characters that didnt have a backstory in dressrosa shouldnt be automatically ruled out, or Oda might not even keep up with that pattern. I think having a dream that makes sense to travel the seas with the strawhats and a new role they can fit into on the ship seem like a better criteria for now. <br><br>Which is why I dont think anyone's joining this arc.</br></br></br>  <br>chapter 816 second page</br>  <br> Oda always tells the sad backstory of a character before they join the Straw hats <br><br>Robin.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, that's Law performing immortality operation on Chopper. You fucked up, /a/non.</br>  <br> Robin <br><br>What is the Tragedy of Ohara</br></br></br>  <br>ooh shit sorry youre right</br>  <br><br><br>I know, I know. I was just joking because Luffy doesn't seem to give 2 shits about it right now.</br></br></br>  <br>Then why did Oda make him suck so much ass?<br>All he did was essentially was use birdcage and then tank every attack thrown at him until he lost.<br>We didn't even get to see him actually fighting save for a few exchanges.</br></br></br>  <br>He was against his own protege and a prick that trained for 2 years solid. The majority of which was under Rayleigh himself. There was no way Doffy could have predicted that kinda growth.</br>  <br>Luffy and Law were absolutely thrashed with just a couple of blows. Also he has to lose, so Oda wrote it that way. We already saw him kicking ass in Marine Ford (Joz and Oars Jr), then fucking smoker up, tanking Aokiji attacks and wasting Luffy and Law. He has been the major villain who kicked the most ass in all fairness.</br>  I wonder how long it'll be before Luffy loses a fight again.  <br><br>Regardless of what happens, Doflamingo will be the best just because of that fabulous pink feathers coat.</br></br>  Which Yonko will Luffy oneshot?  <br>But he did fight back. He put Law on the verge of death, then put Luffy 3m deep inside a wall.<br>Without the whole colliseum team, Doffy would have finished this in 5min, it was a 200v10</br></br>  <br>He technically lost in PH. Most of the crew did.</br>  I'm beginning to suspect Brook might be a bit of a pevert...  <br>Shanks cause he'd be too busy crying over how far Luffy has come.</br>  <br><br> Oda always tells the sad backstory of a character before they join the Straw hats <br> backstory of a character before they join  <br> before they join <br><br>Robin joined the crew before her story was even remotely explored. <br><br>It's entirely possible for someone to join then have their backstory explained later.<br><br>You're an idiot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She was just traveling with them until after Ennis Lobby. Her "I wanna live!" moment was when she officially became a Straw Hat, I reckon.</br>  <br>(Like how Nami was with them for a while and only became a Straw Hat after Luffy took care of Arlong.)</br>  <br>Technically we didn't get Nami's either. Or Usopp, I think. I think we got Usopp's just when they set sail, right ?</br>  <br> sail on a ship <br> obey captain's orders <br>That's all you need to be a crewmate.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you fucking serious?<br><br>How was Robin not a part of the SH during Skypeia? Your statement is complete bullshit and you're pulling crap out of your ass to try justify it.<br><br>You know you're wrong and you're grasping at straws.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's what I'm thinking too. She basically invited herself onto the crew. She became a full member after Enies Lobby is what I always thought.</br></br>  <br>sauce?</br>  <br>One Piece Party 2. It's on Mangastream at least. Probably other places, too.<br><br>Is everyone who's traveled with the Straw Hats and fought along side them a member of the crew? Jimbei? Vivi? Those two bounty hunters from early on?</br></br></br>  <br><br>This is complete bullshit and you know it, the argument isn't "They're not a REAL crew member until they have their backstory is explored"<br><br>The argument is that "Oda always tells the sad backstory of a character before they join the Straw hats"<br><br>If you don't think Robin was a part of the SH's during Skypeia you're being willfully ignorant.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>if you have to spoonfeed, spoonfeed the non-cancerous version retard<br>http://bato.to/read/_/307282/one-pi<wbr>ece-party_ch2--v2-_by_powermanga/2<br>Chapter 3 is also up there as it seems.</br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br>Vivi was asked to join the crew and rejected the offer due to having to take care of Alabasta.<br><br>Jimbei said he would join after clearing a few things up.<br><br>The two bounty hunters were barely even around, maybe a dozen panels at most. Robin was around for Skypia which was 100+ chapters. You're making terrible comparisons to try dig yourself out of a hole.<br><br>I swear do you even read this shit?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>when he kills/cripples mihawk<br><br><br><br>My guess is we are going to meet more BB pirates since their aim is devil fruits and such. Shiliew could maybe be after mihawks sword or title as we speak.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Do people actually like this guy?<br><br>His hat looks super gay.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Turns out a lot of people don't judge a character by how "gay" his hat looks. What a fucking wonderful World!</br>  <br>Danke. Here's your reward.</br>  <br> &gt;I swear do you even read this shit? <br>Becoming a Straw Hat isn't about allying yourself with them, even over a long term.<br><br>It's about not holding back and giving yourself over to them as a cause. Robin didn't fully believe in them until Ennis Lobby when they declared war on the government. She was still holding back because she was afraid they'd dump her or try to turn her in like everyone else in her past.</br></br></br></br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br>They'd better get some decent screentime and be involved in an actual fight.<br>...please.</br></br>  <br>How is this a reward?<br><br>Are you stupid?</br></br></br>  <br><br> she was afraid they'd dump her or try to turn her in like everyone else in her past <br><br>Holy fucking shit you're retarded, you just proved you don't read this shit.<br><br>The reason Robin went with CP9 willingly during W7 was because she truly cared for the SH pirates, she knew that refusing would invoke a buster call and lead them to their deaths.<br><br>Kuzan mentioned that she could have easily escaped if she was by herself, the fact she cared for the SH's was reason enough for her to sacrifice herself. If that isn't enough dedication for you, you can go fuck yourself.<br><br>I'm going to stop responding to you because you're completely wrong and pulling bullshit out of your ass like <br><br> It's about not holding back and giving yourself over to them as a cause <br><br>Your headcanon != canon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're so gay.</br>  <br>Stop posting like a fucking asshole</br>   &gt;not liking gay hats   <br>Chapter 398. It's not even subtext. It's text text.</br>  Does anyone else want some more gun using pirates?  <br><br> I couldn't leave them <br> Not a member of the crew <br><br>k</br></br></br></br></br>    The fuck is up with this party chapters stuff?  <br>Is Aokiji a D?</br>  <br>goddamn that's one of the very few things that would make me insanely mad. No way in hell Roger had the gomu gomu, that's way too much of a clichè  and it's also really fucking retarded </br>  <br> we'll never have a SH gun user <br>Oh well, we still have Izo and Yasop. They're cool.</br></br>  <br>What a shitty spinoff. Most crack doujins are more entertaining.</br>  Oh Bellamy.    <br>Yeah Zoro ain't nothing to fuck with.</br>  <br>what is this?</br>  <br>Kuzan D.  Frost </br>  <br>Is this from one of the movies? I've never watched the anime or any of the movies.</br>  <br>yeah it's from the latest movie<br>the anime has nowhere near the production value for animation like that</br></br>  <br> a well executed fight against a decently strong woman where Zoro doesn't pussy out with cheap excuses and actually take her seriously <br>Movie Z not canon confirmed.</br></br>  <br> Zoro doesn't pussy out <br>The only woman Zoro has met in his entire life worth taking seriously was Kuina.<br>No other woman has proven capable of coming near to challenging him.</br></br></br>  <br>Dunno, but I like this cover.</br>  <br>D stands for Dereshi.<br>Robin knew it from her eavesdropping on the scholars.<br>Monkey Dereshi Dragon</br></br></br>  Who /best boy/ here?  <br> Law <br> fun <br>Pick one!</br></br></br>  <br> actually take her seriously <br>Nope. He knew she wasn't into it before the fight even began. The only thing he ever took seriously was yelling at Luffy.<br><br><br>Rather surprising to see Robin has a bra.</br></br></br></br></br>  Are the Yonkos the only guys capable of rekting the admirals? <br><br>Ace was clearly no where near Akainu league. Jinbe who was Ace level was clearly not as well. <br><br>Aoikiji didn't find much trouble beating Jozu, he completely froze him. <br><br>Fuji implied he could've take Doffy but preferred to let Luffy handle him. <br><br>Marco and Bekhman might be Admiral level but then again Kizaru didn't seem very serious. <br><br>The only guys we've seen who are clearly above admirals are WB and Shanks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Short answer, Yes.<br>Long answer, Yes, the Yonkos are people like Dragon are the only people that strong. The WG needs the entirety of the Marines and the Shichibukai to balance out the Yonko's, and apparently this balance isn't to be fucked with. So, it's safe to assume that the Yonko's are fucking hideously strong.</br></br>  <br><br>Yep, Pirates would just run amok if there's nothing in the Marines stronger than them.</br></br>  <br>maybe not the only ones but yes, Admirals are clearly overpowered as shit.<br><br>and about the people who claim Kizaru was really scared of Beckman, do they always forget that something like five second after Beckman told him to stop Kizaru jumped into the air and spammed a storm of lightrays towards the submarine completely ignoring Benn? It's not like I dislike the guy but come on, it's pretty obvious Kizaru was being sarcastic</br></br></br>  <br> The only guys we've seen who are clearly above admirals are WB and Shanks. <br> Shanks <br>Not necessarily confirmed. He would have been a threat at that point even if he was just normal admiral level. A bunch of well rested admiral level guys showing up all of a sudden would have been too much for the navy to handle, that's why they agreed to stop the battle.<br>We still only have confirmation on the extent of abilities of WB and BB of the yonkos, the rest are still unknown.</br></br></br></br>  <br> le epic not hurt women attack </br>  <br>I like this theory about how the D is actually half of the moon and the people who have D in their names are remnants of the moon people who built the robots up there which connects it to the regular world</br>  <br>This leads me to believe that Sanji won't fight an Admiral. I'm not saying he's weak. By the end, I think Luffy will fight the main ''villain'', Zoro will fight an Admiral and Sanji will fight someone that's on Doffy's level. Which is still impressive. I really don't see Luffy/Zoro/Sanji fighting 3 Admirals separately at all.</br>  <br> Ponyglyphs' actually moon language <br>I kinda want this.</br></br>  <br>I really gotta watch this movie</br>  I just watched Strong World and did anybody else find it a little out of character that when hearing about the East Blue bombings, Luffy was just like "Welp, let's go back" and saying they can just restart their adventure.<br><br>I just feel like that doesn't really sound like something he would do. I mean he didn't even go to help Ace when he heard he was locked up</br></br>  <br>DREAM</br>  <br>Ace was a pirate. Both Luffy and Ace knew what that meant. Luffy was prepared to die every second of the journey. East Blue was a ''symbol of Peace''. East Blue has nothing to do with their fight, so to say. East Blue has tons of Luffy's friends and memories. It's where he grew up and where Daddan is. He went and fought the entire World to try and save his brother. You think he's going to just sit and watch as his entire childhood gets destroyed ?</br>  <br>Dude, wat ? He DID go to help Ace when he heard he was locked up. Luffy and the crew never knew where Ace was in Thriller Bark. All they knew is that Ace was dying/sick/not healthy. Nothing else. For all they know, Ace probably just lost a fight. They knew the paper would grow back when the person gets healthy so they were all happy. When Luffy realised Ace was going to be executed, in Amazon Lily, he immediately wanted to go to Impel Down instead of leaving it to Whitebeard.<br><br>It is sounds Exactly like something Luffy would do.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No because it would make no fucking sense.<br><br>Why wouldn't people who KNEW and SAW Roger fight react to Luffy using his fruit?<br><br>It would be a complete bullshit retcon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this the only reaction image you own?</br>  <br>he's claiming the exact same thing you fucking dingdong</br>  <br><br>Well he was supposed to kill people just for insulting/laughing at his crew.<br><br>I don't think he's a completely good guy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I swear I'll flip out if X Drake isn't named D and D stands for Dinosaur.<br><br>I'll put my face through a window I swear.</br></br></br>  <br>That was early in the series wasn't it? Expect that to be brushed aside and ignored. Roger will just end up being luffy 2.0.<br><br>Or is that .5?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah misread.</br></br>   thanks to toei we will never get one piece remade into a high quality anime   <br> Expect that to be brushed aside and ignored. <br>why?</br></br>  <br> Anonymous <br> 4chan <br> reaction image <br>Do you realise how these things work ?<br><br><br>His name is like Diez Drake or some shit. A man can't have that many D's. It's unnatural.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If Shanks is so strong how did that Sea King manage to bite off his arm?  <br>This was when kid Ace went rage mode and started assaulting people. So, not really that early.</br>    <br>What exactly is keeping the Yonko's from overpowering the marine?<br>I mean we saw that the entirety of the marine together with the shichibukai didn't have the power to take down 1 yonko and his crew.<br>They may hate each other but aren't the marines the common enemy of every pirate alive?</br></br></br>  <br>He is...<br><br>DOUBLE D.</br></br></br>  <br>What do you mean never? They might sell the rights to it in a couple of decades, when they can't milk it anymore.</br>  <br> Toei <br> Selling any of their properties <br> Implying any company can make as much money as they do with their sucessful properties <br><br>Look at what happened when Saint Seiya went to another studio</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HE BET IT ON THE NEXT GENERATION</br>  <br>Not really. The Marines don't actively fuck with the Yonko but the Yonko's themselves keep each other at a stalemate.</br>  <br> X D. Drake <br>I'm not sure I'm ready for the shitposting that would bring with it</br></br>  <br>DOUBLE D's are fine! Triple D's are too much!

He's the only admiral of the original 3 that hasn't done anything</br>  <br>Let's be honest here. Does Sanji have it in him to defeat either Pekoms or Tamago?<br><br>Sanji couldn't even scratch Vergo.</br></br></br>  <br><br> that doesn't even make sense <br><br>'That' pic + lasers.</br></br></br></br>  <br> no dragonballs <br>i am disapoin</br></br>  <br> Luffy vs Akainu <br><br>why can't I possibly imagine Luffy defeating Akainu in a 1 vs 1?

He needs to get his boypanties unbunched soon or I'll start seriously being miffed with him. Got a lot of patience for most antics, but acting this whiny really tries one's patience.<br><br><br>Guess we'll finally see him use Disaster alone and people won't be so confused about it anymore.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Except he has a good reason to mistrust Hendy.<br><br><br><br>Not like it will be a serious fight.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Except he has a good reason to mistrust Hendy. <br>Except that he's the only one reacting to him. Sadly, King's being turned into the hothead in this situation and those types of characters are invariably annoying.</br></br>  <br><br> Your captain instantly forgives Hendy <br> Your captain knows all about the demons <br> Ban, your bff, expressed concerns over your captai's true nature <br><br>That was literally the best moment to make things clear.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>King has had it bad since his conflict with Ban, with everything happening to him, it's no surprise he's losing his shit, especially when Meliodas is forgiving about Hendy, and as it says in the spoilers, King wants to know more about Meliodas and how he knows all these things about the Commandments</br>  <br>It's not just Meliodas. Merlin is there. The Druids, their chief no less, also accepted Hendrickson's presence. The Druids being patroned by the Goddess Clan. You know.</br>  <br><br>Give him a break. He had a lot of stress lately and he is still worried about Diane..</br></br>  <br>So? It's not like Hendy slighted them? It's not like Hendy resurrected and toyed with his best friend body? Meliodas would have incinerated him had he done that to Elizabeth.</br>  <br>That doesn't really excuse his inability to sense the mood. When he's the only one complaining when everyone has accepted Hendrickson's presence, you can't really just blame that on him having a bad day.</br>  <br> Merlin is there. <br>She didn't gave a real fuck in the first place during the liones arc.<br><br> The druids <br>literally why would they care about what Hendy did in his past? It has nothing to do with them and does not damage them in any way.</br></br></br></br></br>  Honestly Im sick of King and his whining. Sure he may have a good reason in pretty much all of them but thats all he's been doing the past chapters. From Gowther, to Hendy , to now Mel.  <br> From Gowther, to Hendy , to now Mel. <br>Shotas gotta shota</br></br>  <br>At least, his griefs are rationals. Unlike yours, whiny boi.</br>  <br> literally why would they care about what Hendy did in his past? It has nothing to do with them and does not damage them in any way. <br>King is currently distrusting Meliodas.<br> King asking Mel if he's a demon and if he's really on his side. <br>It's fine if King hates Hendrickson. It's dumb to be the only one objecting to his presence when the Druid clan, which follows the Goddess Clan (which in turn opposes the Demon Clan), allows him to be there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not really rational, though. His confrontational attitude may be attributed to his being emotional, but being suspicious of Meliodas for knowing a lot about the 10 Commandments and wondering whether or not he's actually their ally?<br><br>He already knew Meliodas' power is related to the Demon Clan. He knew it, but Ban stopped him from talking any further about it. He also knows that they came to the Druid clan to return a great portion of Meliodas' power to him. There really isn't much of a reason why he should be distrusting Meliodas now.</br></br></br>  <br> King is currently distrusting Meliodas. <br> Mel could (from king's view) betray them and fuck them all =&gt; King is fed up <br> Hendy is used goods and a weakling compared to the druids who are training him =&gt; They don't give a fuck, because he can't turn on them in the future and actually fuck them over <br>It's that simple<br><br> It's dumb to be the only one objecting to his presence when the Druid clan, which follows the Goddess Clan (which in turn opposes the Demon Clan), allows him to be there. <br>Hendy isn't part of the demon clan and confirmed as being a druid boy. As Purge and his backstory confirmed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> King is currently distrusting Meliodas. <br>That's another issue. And it is absolutely warranted. Plus, he ain't distrusting him, he wants to know why Melioidas is so knowledgeable about demons.<br><br><br> Mel has exhibited traits of demons <br> Ban has been suspicious of Meliodas <br> Meliodas seems to be ok with ex-demons to be near them (Hendy) <br><br>I wonder why King wants to know more about the situation. It makes no sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Arthur and Gowther paired up <br><br>Fucking yes.</br></br>  <br>What weak rationalization.<br><br>And why would Hendrickson being part of the Druid clan be relevant for King's reaction towards him? It's not as if that's widely known.</br></br></br>  <br> And why would Hendrickson being part of the Druid clan be relevant for King's reaction towards him? <br>Hendy being a druid has nothing to do with King. My point (and I quoted your part that I was refering to) was that Hendy actually belongs to the druids and that the druids are probably helping him, because of that. Reread the part where its revealed that Hendy livid with the druid until a certain age and learned his skills there. He probably knows those guy from when he was a kid. So them not being angry about him is completly normal. King on the other hand lost his bes friend 3 times, because of Hendy. That's something.</br></br>  <br> Asshole revives your dead best friend and causes him to live in a state of agony for about 10 years, you kill your best friend out of mercy even though it breaks your heart to do so <br> Then revives your best friend again, and turns him into a retarded broken wreck as he begs for you to kill him, so you have to kill him again out of mercy <br> Your captain, someone who has quite honestly kind of treated you like shit from the beginning, seems to have no problem with this whatsoever, treating him as if he didn't force your best friend to live in agony for years on end before you have to kill him again so that he can move on <br><br>But yeah, sure, King is overreacting. It's not as if Hendrickson ruined his life and nearly got him killed- oh, wait. Possessed or not, King has every right to be pissed off right now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Merlin's boytoys getting to know each other better <br>It'll make it much easier for her to coax them into a threesome later.</br></br>  I have no problem with the upcoming shirtless shota fight  <br>Let's see<br> Gowther erased the memories of the girl he loved for no other reason than to study shit for his Nobody research <br> Mel is fine with it <br> Hendricksen not only took the corpse of his best friend and revived him not once but twice which time corroding his soul more and more and helped him in his desire to kill humans, but went around killing Holy Knight apprentices with demon blood testing, using the blood of the same demon that killed King's Sister, and was attempting to ritually sacrifice Elizabeth, the reincarnation of Mel's Lover to bring about the Demons and then killed dozens of Holy Knights when he became the Ash Demon form. <br> Mel is fine with this too <br> And Mel is related to the Demons that killed his sister, burned down his home giving him no place to return after the Sins scattered, and who just recently attacked his home again killing dozens of his people. <br>King has every right to be miffed at Mel</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no problem <br> it's not pantless too </br></br>  I hope we get to see Meliodas using his newly recovered power next chapter, hopefully it won't be too much for King.<br>Also new chapter of the highschool manga.</br>  <br> &gt;Gowther erased the memories of the girl he loved for no other reason than to study shit for his Nobody research <br>But he said he's sorry!</br></br>  As this is a NnT thread I would like to point out that everyone should download V15 to actually enjoy Nakaba's art. He improved the chapters by a lot and basically drew all the backgrounds that were missing in the chapters like 114.  <br>Sounds awesome.<br>Man, I am actually hyped for this chapter.<br><br>Give the guy a rest. It's been not even a day he met the traitor knight who let his best friends fight him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or just buy it to support him and help him to earn a living</br>  <br>At this point it's pretty clear that 90% of us steal, I believe.</br>  So maybe King will finally use disaster?  <br>I hope it doesn't end in a disaster.</br>  <br>When he tries, his art is praise worthy, especially his colored works</br>  <br>What the fuck man? King has every right to be angry with Hendrickson. It would be stranger if he had forgiven him as fast as the others did.</br>  <br>He's a drama King that's all. He should know Meliodas better that that, he's pissed and wants to vent his frustration that's all, Mel will wreck him</br>  <br>That entire arc was retarded in hindsight.<br> let me get my shit pushed in by a scrub knight even if I'm super strong <br>A genius' plan, Meliodas.<br>Also, doesn't Byzel imply that Helbram was actually stronger than Hendrickson, since he went against a 10,000+ PL Mel and won?</br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, he had like 20 people giving him their full power. The minimum power level for a Holy Knight in Liones is 300, according to Merlin. That's an extra 6000 that Helbram has added to his power level - probably more, because those knights seem to be particularly good ones.</br>  <br>Helbram was linked to the power of 20 Holy Knights.</br>    <br><br>Nevermind then, I'm retarded. Move on.</br></br>  <br> let me get my shit pushed in by a scrub knight even if I'm super strong <br>What are you talking about?<br> Also, doesn't Byzel imply that Helbram was actually stronger than Hendrickson, since he went against a 10,000+ PL Mel and won? <br>Did you forget what happened?<br>Hendrickson gave his strength to Helbram, due his ability Link.<br>Still Helbram in his prime is most likely stronger than Hendrickson. At least without ashdemon blood.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gustav's PL must be relatively decent considering he's a mid-rank HK.</br>    <br>Yeah, Mel and co. jobbed for most of the early arcs. Mel even says something along the lines of "I better start taking them seriously" at the end of that arc.</br>  <br>Goddammit Carlos</br>  <br>Dat quality tho</br>  <br>I kinda want the seal on the demon clan to weaken a bit more so that a bunch of low level demons can slip through and the holy knights will get a chance to redeem themselves. Some of their designs are pretty cool so it would be a shame if they're never used again.</br>   Gil's thunder shield <br>What a based ability.<br><br>Also i was surprised that King was following Mel without a question for so long, glad they will finally talk about it. But what the fuck King can even do to full powered Mel?</br></br></br>  <br> But what the fuck King can even do to full powered Mel? <br>Nothing but leaving the 7 deadly sins just like Ban, to power up by himself and protect his forest+Diane.</br></br>  <br>Fuck the shield, he had an entire thunder ARMOR<br>If he levels that ability up he'll become invincible to anything that attacks physically and isn't immune to lightning. He's intangibility and self defibrillation away from being Enel.</br></br>  So can we talk about how Gowther and Arthur are WASH AWAY THE ANGER<br>RED PHOSPHORUS JACK, INFARED IS USELESS<br>And with how the pairs worked out it's Threader and Griamor, which how the hell will those two train together</br></br>  Can we have some RUNNING WITH TOAST?     you will never run with toast   My animes have been preparing me for the day when a girl falls out of the sky with a toaster in her mouth.     implying   <br><br> a toaster in her mouth <br>yes please</br></br></br>  If they're running late, why do they take the time to toast their bread?  <br>Good riddance<br><br> forgive the watermark </br></br></br>  <br> Wake up <br> Insert bread in toaster <br> get dressed, pack your shit, tie your shoes <br> toast is now finished </br></br></br></br>  <br> Kawaii desu sugoiiiii x0 </br>  <br>He had probably been planning that selfie all weekend snickering at his own cleverness.</br>  <br>Of course,he is fat,and fat people can't rush withouth sweating and choking.</br>  <br>That sounds like something from cards against megukas.</br>  <br> rushing somewhere <br> has time to take photo and post it on facebook <br>pick one</br></br></br>    We're finally free, /a/. We're finally free...  <br>It died the way it lived.<br><br>A complete and utter waste of time and money.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Do you think they'll burn it with fire and send the ashes out to sea so it wont return again?</br></br>  I'm glad that the S2 announcement was a misunderstanding.<br><br>If anything, I love Ikuhara more now.</br></br>  Just until the next season begins. <br><br><br> But can we have KyoAni to do it this time? </br></br></br>  I don't understand. Who can look at this and allow it. I just...don't.  <br>Toei is always the answer.</br>  That's not how you Sailor Moon.  Muh name is Saaaayluh Mars and I eat da paint chips    SMC was  shit .  <br>What's with the "See you soon" at the end?</br>  <br>Shit, I didn't even pay attention to it. Please no...</br>  If this gets a second season all the stupid weeaboo girls who think they're good at making YouTube videos will rejoice.  <br>Fuck you that's terrible. I don't mind modern sailor moon but k-on style is terrible.</br>  <br> I don't mind modern sailor moon <br>Your taste is shit.</br></br>  You know what annoys me most about the whole thing?<br><br>For nearly 20 years I kept hearing that "If you watched and enjoyed the original version you just got the watered-down version for casuals" spiel repeated over and over and that a manga adaptation would have been the only true path.<br><br>You know, I don't even blame Toei anymore. I really don't. You can paint a turd nicely, but it still retains it shittiness to the core.</br></br></br></br>  The original anime was better than the manga.  <br>80s Toei was GOAT. It made adaptations that surpassed the source materials and brought anime to a massive global-wide scale.<br>Current Toei is absolute shit and cannot even make a decent production out of material that sells itself. See the Harlock and Legend of Sanctuary movies, SS Omega, Crystal. <br>The new DBZ movies and series are also shit, but the DBZfags will eat them up anyway because they're retarded.</br></br></br>  Clearly this show is a dumping ground where most of the magical girl prowess is mostly concentrated on Precure<br><br>It's time for more fans to drop that and switch to Pretty Cure</br></br>  <br>They couldn't even make SMC a weekly series. It's a fucking bi-weekly one.</br>  http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-ne<wbr>ws/2015/07/18-1/school-live-manga-s<wbr>ales-increases-10-times-after-tv-an<wbr>ime-premiere</wbr></wbr></wbr>  <br> cat-hat <br> Not a based hero <br>She will save the world and we all know it.</br></br></br>  <br>She just wants to have tanoshii</br>  <br>no one dies right?</br>  <br>I couldn't find it<br>you can copy paste here I guess<br>here is the link </br></br></br>    We all know homu is great, but which homu is the greatest homu?  <br>Bunny homu is best homu</br>  <br>A dead homu.</br>  <br>shit man thats edgy</br>  <br>You mean a bunny homu</br>  <br><br>It's more edgy to like this selfish bitch</br></br>  Homura is shit  <br><br>You a shit taste</br></br>  <br>Then tell me what is so good about this harlot</br>  <br>She can golf with me and go to the shooting range to practice shooting.

Here's the page everyone been waiting for.  <br>Good<br>Post inucurry shaft angle devil homu</br></br>  <br>Haven't ripped apart the second book yet. Let me see if I can get an acceptable scan for that page.</br>  <br>Pre-Rebellion Homu, Demon Homu a shit.</br>  <br>Why is devil homu always so smug?</br>  <br><br>There he is. There he goes again. Look, everyone! He posted it once again! Isn't he just the funniest guy around?! Oh my God.<br><br> I can almost see your pathetic overweight frame glowing in the dark, lit by your computer screen which is the only source of light in your room, giggling like a like girl as you once again type your little Homu thread up and fill in the captcha. Or maybe you don't even fill in the captcha. Maybe you're such a disgusting NEET that you actually paid for a 4chan pass, so you just choose the picture. Oh, and we all know the picture. The "epic" lesbian magical girl, isn't it? I imagine you little shit laughing so hard as you click it that you drop your Doritos on the floor, but it's ok, your mother will clean it up in the morning. Oh, that's right. Did I fail to mention? You live with your mother. You are a fat fucking fuckup, she's probably so sick of you already. So sick of having to do everything for you all goddamn day, every day, for a grown man who spends all his time on 4chan posting about a mahou shoujo movie. Just imagine this. She had you, and then she thought you were gonna be a scientist or an astronaut or something grand, and then you became a NEET. A pathetic Homufag NEET. She probably cries herself to sleep everyday thinking about how bad it is and how she wishes she could just disappear. She can't even try to talk with you because all you say is "HOMURA DID NOTHING WRONG." You've become a parody of your own self. And that's all you are. A sad little man laughing in the dark by himself as he prepares to indulge in the same old dance that he's done a million times now. And that's all you'll ever be.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because she won the universe. Smugdoka btfo</br>    <br>Best I can do for today.</br>  What's your favorite homu weapon?<br><br>Mine is sniping homu</br></br>  <br>here you go.<br><br>I personally like desert eagle or other hand gun homu.</br></br></br>    best girl  best legs  Here're rough scans of Homura's pages in Rebellion PN. Don't bother saving them. I'll have better scans up over the weekend.        <br>Beautiful</br>                      Would you violently dismember Kyoko if meant you could hug Homu?    <br>Im glad we got to see moemura again in rebellion. One of the things i really like was seeing the transition, starting from the clumsy moemura, and ending with the fucking devil. Rebellion may be either loved or hated, but i personally feel it was great. The Madoka series was great, fuck what /a/ says. However, I really see it as more of homura's story, or rather i like seeing it more from her perspective. In the end it is all about a girl trapped in the fucked up labyrinth called reality. The fact that she does the opposite from what the audience and the other magicas may have wanted makes me like her character more. She saw a chance to not only break free but now be the one making the rules.   homura did nothing wrong  </br>  <br>Yes. If Homu wants me to do it.</br>    <br>This homu.</br>  All this art and not even one homu smile. No wonder it is a miracle of the universe. It is so fucking rare to begin with  <br>Not homu.</br>  <br>Fuck spoke too soon</br>    <br>tomato flavored homu</br>    Kyou~ko~chan!  mami tomoe      <br><br>Non-homus not allowed</br></br>  This is the last Homura design page.  <br>We Kyouko now.</br>  <br>holy fucking smug, step it upp smugdoka</br>  <br>I'd watch a full season of smug homu playing petty pranks.</br>  <br>Eternal Queen of /a/</br>  <br>fact</br>  <br>I am all homu'd out now. Thanks</br>  who HOMU here?  <br>Nah, she smiles plenty.<br>Someone post that image that shows shots of Homu smiling.</br></br>  <br>ready to homuhomu here all night<br><br>but compared to the other magicas it is much less seen. Which makes it a lot more special when she does smile.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128240362 <br><br>MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>I'm surprised how quickly you found that.</br>  <br>Meant for: </br>  <br>What's EMT</br>  <br>Is /a/ glitching again?

Suble things like the snow falling on the mountain road and the fluttering of Caster`s robes were well done too. You might not like the kewl flashing and the designs, I prefer Zero in this regard as well, but that's a stylistic choice and not indicative of animation quality. <br><br>Anyway, some more aesthetic anime<br><br> Tekkon Kinkreet <br> Paprika <br> Patlabor <br><br>I also really liked the clean look of the new HxH, though some people prefer the grittiness of the original.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> more pixels <br>When the fuck did say that?<br>Movies in general look better than TV anime, especially something like GiTS because of better scheduling and budget</br></br></br>  <br>However you spin it, the GitS budget was big. Bigger than any anime series anon.<br>And sure GitS might be the most consistently great animation in a movie but goddamn the Asuka fight scene in EoE was the best thing I've ever saw.</br></br>  I doubt anyone ITT is knowledgeable enough to accurately judge what the "objectively" best looking anime is in terms of technical merits in solid drawing, motion, etc. Beyond that, "the best" is very opinion-based.<br><br>FLCL is the best-looking thing I've seen because it perfectly summarizes everything I like about anime visuals but that's not even close to being "objective".<br><br>Wakfu doesn't look bad or anything but it absolutely does not belong in a list with GITS, Redline, Animatrix and Dead Leaves in it. Some of the motion-tweening looks lazy as fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dude most Shaft anime look cheap as fuck.</br>  <br>If we're being honest about personal preferences I still think highly of the Dissapperance movie.</br>  <br>Are you saying this because it actually has your personal favorite anime aesthetics ever?</br>  <br> Wakfu doesn't look bad <br>Top kek.<br> shitty blur <br> ugly character models and animation <br> terrible animation especially in fight scenes <br>Only frenchaboos think that shit looks good.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I honestly didn't like it but everything was so clean and cut clear. The animation "felt" great. For me Steamboy is the benchmark of Japanimation.</br>  <br>There's no point in trying to be "objective" unless you're a honest-to-god no-irony "animation expert". But even then, I could ask how important perfect or near-perfect technique is to begin with given that only a minuscule minority will acknowledge it. You can be the most technically amazing artist in the world and yet draw things that do not resonate emotionally with people on any level beyond a cold "this person draws and animates well" reaction. <br><br>There are likely people on /ic/ who have more in-depth knowledge of anatomy than a lot of world-famous manga artists whose styles gave joy to millions of people.</br></br></br>  <br>Assuming that we're disregarding Miyazaki and co. for fairness' sake, I think Nichijou comes pretty close, albeit from a much different direction. Honneaise, Samurai X, Memories and Texhnolyze are also close contenders IMO.</br>  <br> Movies in general look better than TV anime <br>Subjective. Both have the same amount of pixels.<br><br> better scheduling and budget <br>By this logic, the biggest selling shows have the biggest budget. Which in turn, you would be calling shows like Naruto, One Piece and Dragon Ball objectively better. Some shit taste you have there, little buddy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Nichijou takes the cake for TV series hands down.</br>  <br>Yeah, most people don't really seem to appreciate how incredible it actually looked.</br>  <br> movies are alotted larger budgets and generally have less time constraints than weekly shows, meaning there's more room for creative freedom <br> somehow this means that popular shows have the biggest budget <br> somehow this means he likes Naruto <br><br>Not him, but you're a fucking idiot. And for the record, Gaara vs. Rock Lee is 10x better animated than anything in Bakemonogatari.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "but doing over the top animation is way more forgiving when it comes to quality" <br>Good over-the-top animation requires just as much skill as good realistic animation. Here's some realtalk from 80s Miyazaki, back when he was a grumpy and critical but passionate guy and not a self-righteous old man trying to fake "sagely knowledge" by being an asshole:<br><br> "Very few animators have a firm grasp of how weight, momentum and acceleration affect the properties of objects, and are able to instinctively visualize in their heads how a movement might play out in space. Even fewer are able to not only do this, but go beyond logic, integrating physics with instinct to create animation that can't be explained but that simply works in the eyes of the viewers. The ability to create animation that works comes from first achieving mastery of how the laws of physics such as weight and momentum work, and then going beyond those rules - saying to yourself, "Drawing it this way would feel better", and drawing it based on that feeling. It's a mistake to think that his style can be mimicked simply by surface imitation of his crazy poses and rough drawings. <br><br> Gatchaman, for example - sorry to name names - certainly impressed with its various innovations, but in terms of the movement turned out to be a classic example of how, no matter how many quick movements or cuts you might string together, the movement simply doesn't feel good or even convincing if it completely ignores the laws of physics." <br><br>Read the full thing here http://www.pelleas.net/aniTOP/index<wbr>.php/miyazaki_on_kanada</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Being completely wrong on everything, the post. <br><br> quality depends on the amount of pixels <br>Plainly retarded. Go watch a 10hour long 4k video of an anus an tell me it looks better than anything.<br><br> nurutu and onepiss have major budget <br>We're talking about the ratio budget:lenght, of course the overall budget is meaningless, it's the amount of budget per second.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because most people in this kind of threads only appreciate "realistic" anime with any kind of semblance to actual human anatomy.<br>Nichijou went with the manga art and it really deserves a mention.</br></br>  <br> biggest selling shows <br> Naruto, One Piece and Dragon Ball  <br><br>Confirmed for not knowing what the fuck you're talking about. Those shows don't sell shit as a TV series. Only their manga does.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bakemonogatari has its "money shot' scenes too, but Norio Matsumoto's Naruto season 1 stuff really was amazing even if the show looks like trash most of the time.<br><br>I prefer his Naruto vs Sasuke fight but Gaara vs. Rock Lee was still great http://sakuga.yshi.org/post/show/80<wbr>26/animated-effects-fighting-naruto<wbr>-naruto_-2002-nori<br><br>Ironically this was the point when I stopped watching the show and decided to only pay attention to the occasional well-animated fight.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>So if the people behind any seasonal anime with shit budget made an 8k native anime it would look better than GitS? Talk about going full retard.<br><br>And anon movies have huge budget and no time constraints that's why they look better than anime made week in week out. Steamboy took 10 years to produce. Eva 3.0 was cut in 2 parts and the second part is taking more than 4 years already. These kinds of budgets and schedules make better looking stuff generally.</br></br></br>  <br> Eva 3.0 was cut in 2 parts and the second part is taking more than 4 years already <br>Too bad the Rebuild films look like shit.</br></br>  <br>I mean, this is definitely a good scene despite the shitty CG.</br>  <br>You know Bakemono had budget and production issues to the brim right? And when people praise it it's not for animation quality. It's the visual direction of Shinbou that people praise.</br>  <br>The anime parts look great anon. The movement and the weights feel realistic. Only CG looks bad and that's because Japan can't into decent looking CG.</br>  <br><br>It was the first really good animated Japanese movie that I watched, so I think it holds a special place in my heart. The art direction, animation, story, character design and music may not be the absolute best in the field, but they all blend together to create what I consider a 10/10 movie.</br></br>  <br>The art direction still feels plastic and artificial compared to FLCL which came out in the early 2000s in the era where most people had no fucking idea how to color digitally</br>  <br>First time actually hearing the dub. For something that is supposedly a highly praised dub, I can't really tell why it gets that high praise.<br>I take its just another case of dub fag nostaliga then.</br></br>  <br>Reading is must be extremely hard since your post has nothing to do with what was being discussed. Kindly, kill youself.<br><br><br> ratio budget:lenght <br>That was literally my point in my previous post and you just confirmed it. Thank you.<br><br><br>Again, no fucking idea what is going on and you reply because you were triggered by those shows. Try reading again, then kill yourself.<br><br><br> make better looking stuff generally <br>Subjective. The same amount of time and energy is put into the 800+ episode shows as well as your movies. The same amount of pixels exist. They are no different as the other anon above kindly backed me up on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you didn't understand the guy you replied to implied budget/length ratio you have some serious autism.</br>  <br>I don't get what are you on about anon? The EVAs always looked artificial. If you're talking about the characters then I'm doubting your vision because they really look great.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zIA<wbr>6ix0HpYU</wbr>  [ ] First 4 minutes, you can skip the rest.<br><br>I could never get myself to sit down and watch the whole movie as it seems to be pretty boring, and I have no idea how Katsuhiro Otomo managed to design such bland Captain Planet-ass characters when he can clearly do far, far better.<br><br>-BUT- <br><br>This scene on its own is absolutely fucking fantastic and Kanada's fire dragon is one of the best examples of creative anime visuals. It shows that the "best" scenes don't necessarily have to be the ones with the most "correct" animation.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why do you turds think budget is everything? Scheduling and a good staff are way more important. Gundam seed destiny had a huge budget, but it looks like garbage. Kyoani has small budgets, but good scheduling.  As much as I hated everything else in the show, Gunbuster's first appearance and in episode 6 was the most visually pleasing shit I have ever watched.  <br>Holy shit this post.<br> pixels = quality <br> He thinks by saying high budget / scheduling = quality that high selling shows = big budget <br> and then goes on to say I like Naruto out of nowhere <br>Nobody can be this retarded</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>3.0 is "LOL MODERN ANIME" as fuck. Same sterile, over-saturated, dreary digital colors as a lot of other "beautiful" shows. 2.0 was actually too washed out, but 3.0 seems to have gone too far in the other direction.<br><br>EoE looks better than all the Rebuilds.</br></br></br>  <br>Even if it took same amount of time, clearly people who make long running shows have to prioritize more on what scenes to put effort into because they have much less money and weekly time constraints. Not to mention accounting for potential scheduling hiccups. Why else do you think One Piece generally looks subpar, but Luffy vs. Blueno or Going Merry's funeral look great? That you can't understand something so basic and think pixel count is the sole determinant of something looking good makes you look like a dipshit.</br>  <br>I doubt anyone would argue that any Eva is better than EoE. But the circlejerk against Rebuild 3.0 is just retarded. It looks fine outside of CG. And the movements of characters feel weighted. They feel like there is an impact to the movement.</br>  <br>Coming from someone who watched the sub first. I prefer the English voice actors for Spike and Faye, really found the voices fits the characters better. <br><br>I think I consider Jet, Ed and the rest to be on equal terms with the sub. Haven't seen it in a while and I need to rewatch both the sub and dub again to confirm that.<br><br>Both Sub and Dub are very good but for me the Dub is marginally better. I understand the praise for it as the voice actors really did an amazing job.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It looks fine outside of CG. <br> And the chins </br></br>  <br>You might be illiterate. <br><br>Just because something sells a lot, doesn't mean it has high budget or better scheduling since those are decided before something airs and is put up for sale. I don't know how someone can be this retarded and make such a logical leap.</br></br></br>   ctrl + F ping pong <br>0 results<br><br> ctrl + F tekkon <br>1 result<br><br>fuck you /a/.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No. KyoAni finds a way.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br> ad hominem <br>Surrender accepted.<br><br> Also, shit that one guy really does watch Naruto. Poor guy. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ping Pong <br>The thread said the most aesthetically pleasing not the most un-moe pile of garbage visuals.</br></br>  <br><br>LEAST AESTHETICALLY PLEASING ANIME POWER RANKINGS<br><br>1. Ping Pong<br>2. Aku no Hana<br><br>POWER GAP<br><br>9001. Dragon Ball Z</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looked fantastic but I wouldn't say it was the most aesthetically pleasing.</br>  <br>Most people don't have the knowledge necessary to appreciate it; if you're just the average anime viewer you're going to think it looks as good as a KyoAni show should and probably not think to hard about it beyond that but if you're an animation buff then Nichijou is a transcendent experience.</br>  <br> EoE <br>Yeah especially with the 3 minutes segments of non anime and the greatest scene when Shingi sees the million Reis. That sure looked nice.</br></br>  <br>about as aesthetically pleases as Aku no Hana<br><br><br>nice taste</br></br></br></br>  <br>DBZ looks like booty though. Face it, HxH is the only long running shounen that looks consistently good</br>  <br>Ping Pong is the least polished of Yuasa's shows and doesn't really belong in a "best visuals" thread for that reason when you have the other stuff he's done, but it still had a fun style.<br><br>Am I the only one ITT who thinks that?</br></br></br>  <br>3.0 gets hate because it's awful. If it offends you you should stop liking such a shitty movie. Those chins are inexcusable.</br>  How should I watch GitS?  For once I'm not going to be a hipster and say Spirited Away. I love everything about its world.  <br>The movie is bad but that has no bearing on the animation or visual direction<br><br>2.0 was a pretty shitty movie too, but that doesn't mean it looked awful.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll give you the chins. But yeah 1 single aspect changed not even for worse doesn't make a movie bad. At least not as offending as the non-anime segments in EoE and people hail that as anime masterpiece.</br>  <br><br>By the way, by "polished" I don't mean that it looks sketchy and thus lazy or whatever because that's the style, I just mean it had far more scenes that screamed "this is a not-so-good part so that we can spend more time on the big scenes" than something like Kaiba or Tatami Galaxy</br></br>  <br>Buy the BDs and watch them on a big TV.</br>  <br>You watch the original movie and forget all the other sequels-spinoffs-fanfiction.</br>  <br>With your eyes, idiot</br>  <br><br>GitS &gt; Innocence<br><br>SAC &gt; SAC 2nd Gig &gt; SSC</br></br></br></br>  <br>that fucking spinning bird kick gets me every time.</br>  <br>People are so starved for quality and DIFFERENT aesthetics that Ping Pong ends up somewhat overrated. Let's face it, there isn't much visual variety TV anime. Anything offbeat will stand out.</br>  <br> the greatest scene when Shingi sees the million Reis <br>If you're talking about this face and actually, honestly see it as a "bad" drawing you are out of your mind.<br><br>The character animation is an improvement over 2.0, yeah, but the art direction is not.</br></br></br></br>  I'd say Redline is objectively the best looking anime there is.<br><br>Not talking about the artstyle which might not be everyones cup, I'm talking about an insane production value that fucking shows. The animation is top notch and everything is insanely detailed. <br><br>It's the one and only Film I ever bothered to get on Blue-Ray and it was worth every cent of it. I even feel guilty about the watching it as a shitty rip before. Do yourself a treat and watch a proper HD rip of it.<br><br>  I have legitimate ADHD though.  </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My point was more that while it's not amazing it's still a fun style. It's the cheapest/most rushed Yuasa anime but the visuals were still handled by good animators when it mattered and added to the experience. It's not a show you watch purely for the writing.</br>    <br>Redline looks good but not primarily because of the "detail"; Trava was not as shiny and high-budget and it still looked great.</br>  <br>You should never ever watch anything primarily for the writing.</br>  This thread is full of idiots and trolls, even most of the people arguing for the right things are doing it the wrong way.  You're all wrong.<br><br>It's definitely Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust.</br></br>  <br>I'm talking about this scene and the non-anime segments of the movie. How can you even legitimately think those are better than any rebuild?</br>  <br>I wouldn't go that far, it's possible for a manga/anime story to be genuinely unique in some way so I won't judge someone for watching it primarily for that. But those who "train" themselves to enjoy things that look different in order to "appreciate the literary merit" are silly. A single-minded focus on "writing" in animation is pretty silly, especially since storytelling can be completely devoid of text. <br><br>Gon is a great manga but no one would say that they like it "for the writing". At the same time it's not good purely because the art is technically good, it's good because the the drawings are used to get across fun emotions and ideas and looks natural, expressive and visually well-researched.</br></br></br>  <br>Time to enlighten us all, Mr. 'I'm above the debate'. Or are you just drive-by posting?</br>  <br>Are you agreeing with me or not? I can't tell.</br>  <br>Just the latter, I genuinely can't be bothered to waste my time arguing with people here any longer.</br>  <br>I'm talking about the art direction; the Rebuilds are made with more money as far as I know so of course EoE will have more budget-saving, but EoE. The live action stuff was a conscious artistic decision. Do you think Anno flashed his own personal hatemail across the screen because they "ran out of budget"?</br>  <br>I agree about 90%, I just wouldn't go as far as to advise someone to not watch something for the writing if they have a reason that doesn't come across as close-minded (i.e. "I'm too used to anime and I don't want to start reading books")</br>  <br>You should've just avoided the thread entirely.</br>  <br>I like to read stupid opinions.</br>  <br>No. But it was an idiotic art decision. The scene looked bad. The whole second part was really bad visually.</br>  <br>Dude, you are completely BADASS! </br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3l3<wbr>yEGblTj8</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Rather bored, watching nerds squabble over things they have no appreciation for is a brief amusement.</br>  What are "the best visuals"? The most detailed art and most fluid animation? Not really since anyone can spend a lot of time detailing a shitty drawing or making a lot of shitty consecutive drawings. Is it the most technically solid drawing and technically mind-blowing animation? I'd also say no. Imagine your least-favorite visual style animated better than Akira and a Milt Kahl Disney sequence combined; wouldn't it still be a shitty style no matter how well it moves or how solidly and three-dimensionally it's drawn? There are also other technical skills that people don't talk about much when it comes to "objective quality", like variety of facial expressions and poses.

I'll probably stick with them, but I wonder how much do I miss by not going with H&amp;D  <br>H&amp;D is better in my opinion.</br>   EP03 subs when   <br>Commie basically invents their own song subs.<br>Compare commie's beyond the blade with this.</br></br>  I guess two more hours before they finish encoding, quality checking and fapping to Kirika's panties, right?  <br>To be fair, H&amp;D's version has very poor flow.</br>  <br>How fortunate, my drift are Anime-chan and short hair</br>  <br>I'd rather have a correct translation than a better flow but wrong one.</br>  <br>She couldn't use it, probably because she only had little pieces of the gungnir while Maria and Kanade had a full shard of it at least. Still she's the best Gungnir user.</br>  <br>Comeme is okay if you're not a weeabo autist.</br>  <br>It doesn't matter how small the shard is, it's magic. She couldn't use it because she doesn't want to fight people.</br>   open back shirt with a large neck cut <br> bra straps visible on the shoulders and on the back <br>Maria a lewd.</br></br>  <br>There are times when Tsubasa reaches inside, fondling Maria's miracles of the universe while thinking of Kanade.</br>  <br><br>Footfag fuck off.</br></br>  <br> tfw Tsubasa can fondle Maria's Marias behind anytime she wants because of that lewd outfit <br>Sweat.png</br></br>  <br>They're different, and?<br><br>Not sure how you can say one is correct and one is incorrect when nobody knows what the actual lyrics are yet.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Commie is known for their memeshit trollsubs.<br>That's what defines them.</br></br></br>  <br>And /a/ is known for talking shit about translations without ever referring to the original Japanese.<br><br>Pointing to one translation and saying "this other translation is different" without comparing to the original language is meaningless.</br></br></br>  <br>you're literally the fucking definition of gay if you don't find a girl's feet arousing.</br>  <br>they were pretty okay during Yahari though.</br>  <br> you're literally the fucking definition of gay if you find a girl's feet arousing. <br>Fixed.</br></br>  It's going to take a while before Chris lives this down  <br>'Known for' doesn't cut it outside of the series where they actually do that. All it does is stir shit up.</br>  <br>Hello, commie dev. ETA?</br>  <br><br>Getting her ass kicked, getting stripped nude in public, or being saved from certain death by her kouhai?</br></br>   Sex: Unknown <br><br>Would you take the chance?</br></br>  <br>At the very least elfnein has a mouth.</br>  <br>That shit about commie memeshit trollsubs is bigger meme than anything commie puts in their subs. IMO their based typesetting is what defines them, but whatever. <br><br><br><br>They're okay most of the time. They will translate japanese memes into dank leddit maymays, but usually they're not trolling that much.</br></br></br></br></br>   Homunculus   <br>11no is such a weird name.</br>      So did Gungnir just get tired of her shit or what?  <br>I've figured it out, with that comment: Blue will steal the gungnir relic, hibiki will use dainsleif, and the GUNGNIR DATTO will come from homonculus kanade.</br>  <br>Isn't it the other way around, with people saying that the foot represents the penis?</br>  <br>She needs to get her emotions together so Genjuro can say GUGNIR DATO?!</br>  <br><br>Wouldn't you?<br><br> corpses of innocent people everywhere, your friends are in immediate danger and you have the power to stop it <br><br> B-but I don't want to fight! </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Also she has an anus.</br></br></br>  <br> can detect chemical makeup and brainwashing <br> can't detect sex </br></br>  <br><br>it means either eleven-no or elf-9</br></br>  <br><br>Can't detect what isn't there.</br></br>  In answering to the fan letter "Will Miku turns into a yandere again or not?", Iguchi gave a really confusing and vague reply, basically<br> In S3, she's become more mature and is able to support Hibiki properly. Even though she's worried, she believe in Hibiki and will send her off with a smile so you don't need to worry, it's fine. <br> However, at one point in the series, in one scene, it seems like she's about to fall in the dark side like in S2. Like she's in a deep darkness, like it'd make you go "Huh? What's up with this girl?". She might or might not going to get into a dangerous situation, and then when she's saved, her smile might or might not make you go "Huh? Is that okay? Huh?", or something like that. <br> Miku will definitely won't fall into darkness, she's just sincerely thinking about Hibiki. That said, she's gonna call out her hidden side and fool around a little bit. </br></br></br>  That sash Tsubasa's wearing is see-thru  <br>She can't fight because she doesn't want to hurt anyone, and is tired of being forced to punch people to save them. She needs her own reason to fight, not just reason to help. I just hope it doesn't mean she will get her Armed Gear, punching things is much more fun and awesome than just fighting with spear. Unless her Armed Gear is berserk mode. I want this.</br>  <br>I didn't watch Commie's episode 2 so I don't know about the songs there but some parts of their translations for G-beat/Glorious Break in episode 1 are clearly made up.</br>  <br><br><br>Can you both just kill yourselves and make our lives easier? Thanks.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Then why is it opaque?</br></br>  Biki butt  <br><br>Buy the BDs.</br></br>  <br>Nana doesn't want Tsubasa's naked body to be seen by everyone. Her self-insert isn't a slut.</br>  <br>My favoutire Miku is coming back</br>  <br>Tsubasa's butt doesn't make any sense.</br>  <br>They probably just dropped "No.11" into google translate.</br>    <br><br>The butt hasn't changed much since season one</br></br>  <br>Mere mortals can't even begin to grasp it.</br>  <br>This is just as confusing as Nana trying to explain why the joke "I'm a chimpanzee!!" is funny.</br>  <br>I'm just glad that unlike G where she was almost none existent in the first half, we're and will get a steady dose of Miku this season.</br>  <br>She has no butt anon, she's a sword.</br>    <br>Only advanced beings like Nana can appreciate Tsubasa's heavenly butt.</br>  <br><br>If there's a hole, it's a man's duty to fill it</br></br>  <br>Is there anything they won't deliver? So far it seems like S3 is going to have more than everything that made previous seasons great. I'm lovin' it so far  and I don't think it's "so bad it's good", I genuinely think this anime is great. I'm probably autist tho.  </br>  <br>WTF is going on with the lower half of Chris' body?</br>  Hibiki's body is heavenly<br><br>Maria is a lucky girl  or whatever girl comes next after she dies horribly like Kanade </br></br>  Remember?  <br><br>She's presenting</br></br>  <br><br>Was it  consensual loving sex in the missionary position ?</br></br>    <br> Want to call the lolis shit out of instinct <br> They were actually great this episode <br>Everything I know is a lie.</br></br></br>    <br>i remember the terrible english, yes.</br>  <br> calling lolis shit <br>You seem to have pretty shit instincts.</br></br>  <br>Too bad the subs are vomit inducing and even less accurate than Commie.</br>  <br>I want DMJii to be the official battle couple and have a dual transformation at some point this season.</br>  <br>Holy shit you people are retarded I would never defend Commie but CR had major errors on even the simplest of lines but if you want to eat shit be my quest.</br>  <br>And yet she still gets flustered whenever Hibiki and Miku get too intimate in front of her. What the hell?<br><br> AS REEPOUTHED </br></br></br>  <br><br>Okay seriously what does Chris think home is for?</br></br>  <br>Their commander is Genjuro.<br><br>Anything you say is invalid.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, she technically was at Fine’s home.</br>  What the hell happened to these threads that there are so many posters that clearly barely know English or Japanese commenting on translations? On top of that even saying it's ok to watch the third season of a show first?  <br>So Chris from all of them knows what lesbian sex is.<br><br>She should teach other who looks to be all innocent or dense about it.<br><br>I bet when she sees HibiMiku together she has lewd things all the time what they are doing together home alone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's exactly because of that experience she tells them to do that stuff at home. In her mind they could start just stripping and going at it right there like a couple of monkeys.</br>  <br>Tsubasa's wing hair is getting longer.</br>  <br>Is she okay?</br>  <br>Look up nyaa, see what's the latest subs for GX. Crunchyroll happened that's what. Bringing in all the stream fucktards and casualfags that download everything 'subbed' by HS.</br>  <br><br>She will be after Maria 'nurses her back to health' if you know what I mean</br></br>  <br>Well, she's getting older.<br>The time she reaches the same age as Maria her hair will be long enough to be her scarf when winter comes.</br></br>  <br>Drawfags please</br>  Exterminate is on nyaa.  <br>There's a theory among Japanese fanbase currently.<br>In major Arcana, 11 stands for justice. Nein means no or deny in German.<br>So Elfnein means no/deny justice.</br></br></br>  EXTERMINATE!!!!!!!  <br> when nobody knows what the actual lyrics are yet. <br>It's not like some people might know japanese too, right?<br>The demo for the song is out on the website and H&amp;D clearly got it right for the most part.</br></br></br>  <br>FUCK<br>U<br>C<br>K</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tsubasa is an idol. She will keep her hairstyle in check and probably visits a hairdresser regularly.</br>  <br>What if she can't cut it since it's become sentient like Maria's hair?</br>   tfw no Glorious Break on the Exterminate disc <br><br>God damn it. I'm still happy, but I wanted Glorious Break as well.</br></br>  <br> tfw I like track 03 more <br>ITS ONLY BRAVE<br>ASHITA NO<br>KISEKI WO SHINJITE</br></br></br></br>  Pick a fruit<br><br>Hard mode:  no fruit salad </br></br>  <br>L E M O N<br>E <br>M<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br></br>  Lemon  <br>Ringo.</br>  <br>fruit COCKtail</br>  Cherry  Lemon  <br>Cherry's breasts are the biggest, thereby making her the best girl automatically.</br>  grape? anyone?  <br>Lemon.<br> <br>I really like her voice actor and most games her voice actor is in you can't get with that girl. </br> </br></br>  <br>Yeah.<br>I want to sniff grapes' armpits and asshole.</br></br>  Where is my strawberry?  <br>I agree grape<br>You cant spell grape without rape am i right</br></br>  <br><br><br> literally retarded </br></br></br>  <br>Lemon = Apple &gt; Grape &gt; Cherry</br>  Lemon.
