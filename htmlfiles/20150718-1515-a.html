[ Hey guys, I love horror shit and i crave a good horror anime, I have only seen another and higurashi if that even counts. Your help will be appreciated  Ghost Slide.  <br><br>What about manga? There's a lot more horror there. Anime these days is 90% shounen shit, harem shit, or LN adapted fujoshit.</br></br>  <br>I might sound like a faggot but Im not really a manga kinda guy</br>  <br>faggot</br>  <br><br>You owe it to yourself to give manga a try. You're missing out on a lot of great series that never got adapted</br></br>  <br>I guess I should</br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br><br>Ok, I'm gonna try to stick to lesser known shows. I'm sure you've heard of Parasyte, Tokyo Ghoul, etc. So here goes:<br><br>1. Shigurui Death Frenzy: Not sure if this counts as horror, but there are some really tense scenes and a lot of gore. Here's an example:<br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rA<wbr>RXeeHbnS4</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>2. Shiki: A small town that's very far from civilization gets a vampire problem. People's family members start disappearing, but coming back at night to feed on their loved ones<br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=W6<wbr>yEzWAd_vg</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>3.Another: A bit like the Japanese version of "final destination", but with a better story, better pacing, and much scarier moments.<br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=iL<wbr>HWglZrnC0</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>4. Corpse Party - Tortured Souls: Probably one of the bloodiest/goriest anime I've ever seen. Don't want to spoil much, but just watch it.<br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=76<wbr>vJ4awYjmo</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>5. Gantz: Not as good as the manga, but still watchable. It's about people who have just died being resurrected in this strange room, then (with bombs implanted in their brains) forced to play this weird game, hunting down strange creatures.<br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=o_<wbr>k5LCfyooc</wbr>  [ ] </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  http://lmgtfy.com/?q=good+horror+an<wbr>ime<br>Why is the internet so unbelievably difficult?</br></wbr>  <br> Another <br> scary </br></br>  <br>1<br><br>2<br><br>3<br><br>4<br><br>5<br><br>6<br><br>7<br><br> XD I SPOONFEEDED MAISELF /A/ IS SO PWMZED!!!!!!! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Silly OP, there are no good horror anime. The best you'll get is a decent horror scene in some otherwise mediocre series. Case in point, the underground dungeon torture scene in Higurashi.<br><br><br> Ghost Slide <br>HAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHA YOU'RE SO FUNNY</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Then you're missing out on some of the best horror ever. I was gonna suggest reading anything by Junji Ito, but at least there's an adaptation (albeit 1 OVA) of one of his works<br><br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=iZ<wbr>ugt3fiBe0</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>If you want something easier to read, then try Cradle of Monsters or Island</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Thanks, mods, for all the great FINDING ANIMEZ 2 HARD EVEN THO U ALL CAN DO IT IN 2 SECENDS SO LIST 4 ME threads.  <br>Thanks, anon, for whining about it instead of hiding the threads and posting on threads you actually approve of</br>  <br><br>What would you rather have? The constant shitposting waifu threads? People complaining constantly? Pedos talking about lolis?<br><br>All OP asked for was info. And no, you can't really google that shit, since all those top 10 lists put garbage like Attack on Titan or Mirai Nikki as 'the best'.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking this.<br><br>Deal with it /a/</br></br></br>  <br>All of those are significantly better than these threads. Why can't you google it? Because you said I can't even though I googled it and found tons of good results in tons of sources far outweighing the mirai nikki posts?<br><br>Wow, you're right this didn't work https://www.google.com/search?q=goo<wbr>d+horror+manga<br>Oh wait, it did. Look at all the people begging for and getting all the epic recommendations they want.</br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>OP asked for anime, not manga, brah</br>  <br>Guess what works if you replace manga with anime, brahhhhh. But I guess you couldn't figure that out because you couldn't google in the first place, brah.</br>  <br>  I'm sure you've heard of Parasyte, Tokyo Ghoul, etc. <br> but not these other five <br>When did Gantz get eclipsed by Tokyo Ghoul?</br></br></br>  <br> replace manga with anime <br> run search <br> click on first site <br> go through list <br> second anime: Mirai Nikki <br> third anime: Higurashi <br> fourth anime: Elfen Lied <br> Elfen fucking Lied <br> good results <br><br> Guess what works if you replace manga with anime, brahhhhh. <br>What?

Some decent mystery and psychological stuff but if you'd want pure horror you're better off watching live action stuff.  <br>The only two I could ever watch were Shikabane Hime, which is basically The Poltergeist + zombies, and  Ghost Stories ADV Dub. </br>  <br> humour idiot and look at top mentioned shows <br> Hell Girl <br> Paranoia Agent <br> Ghost Hound <br> Madoka (I shit you not) <br><br>You're now either butthurt and shitposting or some completely clueless newfag</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Since most manga get anime adoptions, he wont really miss much.</br>  <br>Madoka was scary af tbh imo especially with the witch yeah</br>  <br><br>Summer is here.</br></br>  <br> Blood-C is third <br>Holy shit.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>It's not like /a/ has a wiki full with recommendations, right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're terminally retarded. Please never use the internet again.</br>  <br> things OP would like <br>But you're the shitposter who crawled out of /v/ to scream /a/ is bad because you don't know how to google.<br>http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topic<wbr>id=551673<br> google doesn't work <br> IT DUZNT WERK!!!!! I NEED MOAR THREADS ON /a/ 2 FIND ANIMES!!!! </br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Someone mentioned Ghost Hound today and said it has a middle schooler trying to fuck a loli, does that goes somewhere?  <br>And you're so new it hurts, that's literally komeiji b8</br>  Okay, I'm sold.  <br>Anime Is not terrible but just plain bad.</br>  <br><br>Bad as in naughty, sure. I love it ;^)</br></br>  A loli shinigami will never sit on your lap because of how your killstreak reached the THOUSANDS  Reminder that "pandering" isn't a meme. Sometimes it makes perfect sense.  I've only seen a few minutes of goth loli and I'm already in love.  Goth loli confirmed for girl of the season  Anime Rory a shit  <br>Fuck off manga nerd</br>  <br>right. The show itself is kind of meh, but she has smugfu levels of show carrying potential. Her animated scene are nicely done as well. Very satisfying choreography.</br>  <br>Make me animeonlyshit</br>  <br>Have you ever been in a fight? Because i have.<br>Im pretty sure i could hit you so hard your mother would start bleeding.</br></br>  <br>The only good thing about the anime is Itami's VA, he does a superb job.<br><br>Everything else is off.</br></br></br>  So far the anime has been better than the manga. <br><br>I'm completely serious; the manga is objectively terrible pacing.</br></br>  Join today!  Manga &gt; anime.<br><br>It doesn't even matter what the anime may have done better. Fucking up Rory and Kuribayashi's designs is just too much.</br></br>  <br><br>No Fair!</br></br>  <br> better than the manga <br>So you don't mind butchering of characterisation due to censorship/cut scenes?<br><br> objectively terrible pacing <br>How? The manga did things like explain how the elf was in the well when they found her which the anime hasn't done yet. Also Spending 15 min on how otaku Itami is in the first ep was terrible.</br></br></br></br></br>  gothic loli (rori?) saved the show  <br> butchering of characterisation due to censorship <br><br>What are you talking about?</br></br></br>    <br>Her voice was the best part of the episode.</br>  <br><br>Same here OP. I watched these three today, and said fuck it and read all the manga.<br><br>While it still has a bit of a harem going on I really do enjoy  the fact the Military is still a strong giant force to not even be touched in their world. Like the premise of something existing that could actually take down the stationed Japan Military just doesn't exist. I wonder how the manga will end, setting up all these different things. I think the most recent chapters where they take down the Fire Dragon was pretty nice, especially with them flying in on the fighters and just demolishing everything. Generally if a character meets a hurdle in the manga and the military can't do anything it's for diplomatic and real reasons instead of some stupid anime tier reasoning. <br><br>But now that I read it all I'm kind of sad. Is there any manga/anime similar to this? Basically two worlds meeting.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The they cut out things like how Rory and her goddess don't believe murder or even rape to be a sin just "human nature".</br>  <br><br> vlcsnap </br></br>  Help me, anons, I have become the lowest common denominator. I couldn't help but keep laughing continuously at this scene. I'm loving this anime.<br><br><br>Well, there's Outbreak Company. The anime is really good but it's way more focused in politics and pacific relationship than the use of military.<br>There's really one episode where they BTFO a dragon and everyone gets impressed but it doesn't really affect the anime in any way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much the only things so far (it could still be inserted on Italica, though)., also in my opinion her whole speech in that scene is contrived and contradictory by itself Other than that they added a bit of characterization for both Itami and the female medic.</br>  I don't really mind things getting cut. It's easy to understand why they can't fit everything due to time constraints.<br><br>Besides, if I have read the source then all that nice background info is in my head already and I still understand. If I haven't read the source then I got something to look forward to if I decided I like it enough to go read.</br></br>  <br>I agree, i kinda wan't to drop it but i will give it a chance if it gets better.</br>  <br> could still be inserted on Italica <br>Hopefully they won't censer that battle and how she gets when near battles.<br> her whole speech in that scene is contrived and contradictory by itself <br>It just gives people an early idea of how she isn't just some simple goth loli who has a different sense of justice to normal. Anime only people may miss out on that point.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah I know of Outbreak Company already. It was semi enjoyable. I feel the the MCs tendency to be a giant weeb and start teaching everybody "otaku" culture was a bit too much, but it wasn't terrible. It feels like these two are the only ones though.</br></br>  <br><br><br>How do I get me a gothic loli who actually WANTS to be raped?</br></br></br>  After seeing the first episode I thought this would be one of the best animes in a long time. But now it's quickly diven headfirst into a pile of mediocrity. It's like when you see a commercial for a delicious burger and then you try it and it tastes like the frozen burgers you get at safeway.  <br><br>Would No Game No Life suffice?<br><br>Not quite military vs. military action but definitely two worlds colliding in a way. Very good anime in general, either way.</br></br></br></br>   that bemused knowing look <br> diamonds <br><br>It bugs me that the anime doesn't have the blood and guts that the manga does. The dragon was nowhere near as threatening as in the manga. Why do they do this shit?</br></br></br>  Why aren't they studying the sky?<br>They should research astrological stuff, like how much a year takes, if they are still on the milky way, no, if they have any similarities between the constellations and super-clusters.<br><br>If they two worlds are actually in the same universe it would be pretty fucking neat.</br></br></br>  <br> that bemused knowing look <br> "perhaps I have finally found the right group of men who can finally successfully rape me" </br></br>  <br> I couldn't help but keep laughing continuously at this scene. I'm loving this anime. <br>ya, you're hopeless.</br></br>  <br> Japan <br>Better keep looking.</br></br>  Lips make every female character 10 time better<br><br>We need more lips in anime</br></br>  <br> lol those lovebirds, so hopeless! <br> meanwhile... <br> "can't wait to get back to my porn video tonight!" <br><br>Don't let your dreams be dreams, anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Already a thread, no need to make another one.</br>  <br> trying so hard to appear tough you start lying on the internet </br>  Same VA.<br><br>Yes</br></br>   http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/17/<wbr>world/asia/japans-lower-house-passe<wbr>s-bills-giving-military-freer-hand-<wbr>to-fight.html?_r=0</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br>Coincidence?</br></br>  <br> Saki from Shinsekai Yori <br> Yukari from Yuyushiki <br> Ayaya from Kirino Mosaic <br>Is she going to be the new HanaKana?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not at all. Abe Shinzo actually wrote Gate under a pen name.</br>   Finally get home from doing stuff with my daughter <br> "Maybe this episode will have more blood and gore..." <br> Disappointing lack of gore <br><br>Jeeze theyre starting a pattern</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Is cumming when you eat good food only limited to girls?</br></br>  The scene with her in the truck was nice. Where she just watched them talking.  <br> yfw there is literally a librlul "anti-abe" movement in japan who wants no war ever under any circumstances because lol war fuck the reason </br>  <br>I totally agree with you. This show could definitely use more gore, because you know... Chinese cartoons with sex and gore are for mature adults like us. Right? <br><br>Anyway, I honestly don't mind that they toned it down for the show. I think that they are still covering the things that most deserve coverage. The omissions haven't been major yet.</br></br></br>  <br>It's miles better than the manga, Rory is actually sexy here.</br>  Why the fuck was the horse making the noise of a baby crying?  <br>No, the male judges strip too.</br>  <br> It bugs me that the anime doesn't have the blood and guts that the manga does. <br>That's because you're edgy, and probably underage. The "blood and guts" added nothing, and was even a bit of a distraction.</br></br>  <br> It's miles better than the manga <br><br> Rory murders bandits with not a drop of blood in sight </br></br></br>  <br>Take off your /pol/ goggles dumbfuck, Abe's approval ratings take big hits from LDP voters as about much as any "librul" groups, it's pretty much across the board in Japanese society.</br>  <br>They have been, it mentions it later in the novel. Particularly because they want to launch satellites.<br>It's a big invasion force, not everything happens around the MC's group.</br></br>  Will they ever find this slut some clothes?  <br><br>It's censored to shit.</br></br>  <br>Watch the preview.</br>  <br> elves <br> clothes <br>The only clothes elves should wear is semen and their blood.</br></br></br>  <br> Where's muh gorefest? </br>  <br>It was a rhetorical question.<br><br>http://www.helpguide.org/articles/a<wbr>utism/autism-symptoms-and-early-sig<wbr>ns.htm</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>If they omitt muh Myuute im sending them a box of horse turds.</br>  Its a kids cartoon, why is everyone expecting blood and gore?  <br> &gt;/a/128213971 </br>  <br>Are you Korean or Chinese <br><br><br> It's censored to shit. <br>Which is a huge improvement, this story didn't need the Michael Bay treatment.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's an important part of the story and her character you fucking retard.</br></br>  The dirtiest sluts always have the purest smiles.  <br> priestess of a god of murder murders people <br> Michael Bay treatment <br><br>I don't even...</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>How many dicks has Rory taken? Over 100 would have to be the lower bound, right?</br></br>  <br>Necrophilia doesn't count, so she's still a virgin.</br>  <br>How old is she? I thought she was a few hundred years old, in which case 100 might not be enough.</br>  <br><br>900 years Anon. Even if she fucks somebody only once per month (yeah, right) the number is quite a bit higher than 100.</br></br>  <br><br>she's an Elf, she thinks that little sheet are her clothes now</br></br>  I thought she was telling him off in this scene. Don't Japs have a thing about showing your inner eyelid as being akin to sticking your tongue out?  <br>They do, but they also stick their tongues out while doing it.</br>  That scene was so much more dramatic in the manga  <br><br>The manga gives her the unexpected characterization of a girl who actually prefers long term relationships with interesting people.<br><br>Still, I bet it's quite a few.</br></br></br></br>  <br> that breast line thats not a smooth curve <br><br>Augh</br></br></br>    <br>Japanese people need more subtlety. Im sick of reading LNs and having the faggot of an author spend pages explaining minor details.<br><br>It's implicit from her being part of a religious cult and slaughtering people.<br><br><br>Blood and guts takes a fair bit out of budgets. This isn't the 90s either.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>The manga sure has ugly art.</br></br></br>  <br> a gothic loli who actually WANTS to be raped <br><br> men who can finally successfully rape me <br><br>Did I miss something here or does she actually want to get raped?</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>She was acting like a semen demon the whole time.</br>  <br>It's just /a/nons screwing around</br>  <br>okay im convinced. going to horriblesubs now.</br>  The jeep scene needed more animation  <br>It's a good thing they fucking FINALLY introduced the girl characters in this piece of JSDF propaganda trash. This show was up until now failing my 3 ep test.</br>  <br>Did he kick her off, or did she just not like sitting on his "pistol"?</br>  How the fuck will they animate  the prince raping the bunny queen and dragging his sex slaves over the ground with chains on their necks and then getting completely beat up? <br><br>They can't leave that out since it will just ruin everything.</br></br>  <br>Too costly, it's easier to just loop the jeep shaking.</br>  <br>This is supposed to be wholesome nationalist propaganda. Not porn.</br>  <br> showing your inner eyelid <br>what?</br></br>  <br>Kicked her off, went back on, had some petty fighting and then settled for leaning on to him from the side.</br>    <br>Ah I'm silly. That makes sense.</br>  <br>That has got to be sad. Be in a long relationship with a human who you genuinely love. They die of old age. Eventually you find someone else, they die of old age as well. Continue for 900 years.</br>  <br>Watch more anime. Jesus, dude.</br>  Speaking of gestures.<br><br> pointing to an opened mouth <br>this is the international sign for fellatio</br></br></br>   she'll never climb on your lap   <br>Censor like a motherfucker.<br><br>My question is how are they gonna have Kubayashi beat the shit out of that bitch when they've made her look like a moeblob</br></br></br>  <br>The more I look at her, the more disgusted I am at the anime.</br>  <br>what's up with the awful editing?</br>  <br>I actually wouldn't mind it that much if they  cover the sex slaves with some rags and use sheets for the rape scene  I fear however that they just won't show it at all.</br>  <br>/ak/</br>  <br> you now remember there's an onsen scene when nearly all the girls' boobs are naked and uncensored <br> you now realize you won't see shit in the anime </br></br>  By the way, wasn't Lelei supposed to have silver hair or am I remembering it wrong?  <br><br>No. It was always blue. Because her family are aliens.</br></br>  <br>Also  Itami washing off Rory after her killing spree there. <br><br>I don't get why they went this way for the anime, doesn't fit the series at all.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well fuck it the anime's not gonna live up to the manga or LN any possible way so I may as well fuck around with edits to enjoy myself. Was planning on doing a side story following the adventures of bane and cia in this magic world if I felt like it or it was received well. <br><br><br>Pic related(resized for file limit) is 1st(or 2nd if I plan on editing the invasion) and the 2nd(3rd?) is the one I did earlier with cia standing in front of the jeep titled "Gate: Thus The CIA Crashed There!" Tell me what you think took like an hour to make the bane exploitable since apparently no one bothered to make one before. <br><br>Also manga Rory is better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The anime made me pick up the manga again after putting it on hold.<br>Currently around the 4th tank.<br>Is the princess added to Itami's harem?  looks like it from the garden party. <br>Same with brown elf right? hope so at least, even if we already know who's gonna win.</br></br></br>  Leilei a cute<br>That scene with the horse was pretty underwhelming though.</br>  <br> That has got to be sad. Be in a long relationship with a human who you genuinely love. They die of old age. Eventually you find someone else, they die of old age as well. Continue for 900 years. <br>Well she only got 39 years left, so Itami is her last partner in this world.</br></br>  <br> That scene with the horse was pretty underwhelming though. <br>Most of it is</br></br>  <br> 720p </br>  <br> anime </br>  Blimey that .50 Cal was weak as shit<br>Sound design guys step yer game up</br>  <br> /a/ </br>  <br> Blimey </br>  <br>I'm not the only who think the anime art is a big improvement over the manga, right?<br>I like the manga but it's fucking ugly.</br></br>  <br> Not contrabanding your porn using fish <br>works everytime</br></br>  <br> contrabanding <br>You mean smuggling?</br></br>  <br>Yes, i do.</br>  <br>When you eat the porn to get rid of the evidence, it becomes contraband.</br>  <br>One more reason to dl shit instead of being a buyfag<br><br>lol "offensive to moral standards of reasonable adults". How did you determine who's a reasonable adult, cunt?<br><br>I fucking hate censorship</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How did you determine who's a reasonable adult, cunt? <br>Welcome to the redpill.</br></br>  <br><br>Redpillers are basically feminists, except that they serve male interests instead of female. They're a bunch of hypocrites.<br><br>They're not the good-willed, rational, egalitarian-minded people that are needed to weaken and ultimately destroy feminism, along with its bigotry, fear mongering, and double standards. Every time a red piller opens his mouth to speak on gender politics, it reinforces the idea in the minds of neutral observers that feminism is right and women are the victims.<br><br>"You're only as strong as your weakest link."</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What does this word even mean in Australia? When I see you guys writing things on the internet, I can only think that you speak a separate language than we do.</br>  <br>Will the Dark Elf waifu appear this season?</br>  <br><br>It means the same. Equate it to bitch in American English.</br></br>  I don't know what's more erotic.<br>The girls, the /ak/ porn, or a contemporary army wiping the fuck out of a stuck up and stubborn old one.</br>  <br> Rory doesn't win. Nobody wins in Gate. It ends with Itami and his harem stuck on the fantasy side. <br><br> Sequel has started, don't know what happened in the interval but it seems like nobody has made babies with Itami yet. </br></br></br>  <br>No I'm just not a retard.</br>   Show sucks <br> /a/ loves it anyway because it has a cute girl in it  <br>Every time. You see the same thing on /v/ and /co/ as well. It's amazing how willing people on this site are to forgive bad quality in exchange for some T&amp;A.</br></br>  <br>It doesn't mean the same. In American English, "cunt" is one of the last, most sacred dirty words that we have yet to dilute through mass, common usage.</br>  <br>   Rory doesn't win. Nobody wins in Gate. It ends with Itami and his harem stuck on the fantasy side. <br>Disgusting. But I guess expected from the country that has mastered unsatisfactory endings.<br> Is the sequel in form of LN or the standard Novel? Is it about him going back or dealing with stuff inside the gate? is he the only one? <br> Are these spoilers easily found in baka tsuki or something similar? </br></br></br></br>  <br>This.<br><br>It's really annoying how quickly people change their mind on a show just because of some cute girl and/or loli.</br></br></br>  <br>Show sucks in some areas but manages to do an alright job in others.<br>If you can ignore some plot elements, the nippon steel folded a thousand times propaganda, and other shit, it's an enjoyable dumb ride.<br>Although to be honest, I only expected /ak/ to watch it.</br></br></br>  <br>I've been having fun since the first ep</br>  <br> Not wanting assploding corpses. <br>Faggit.</br></br>  <br> I believe it's LN format. Just lurk around Gate discussion sites, like /a/ or Animesuki. Basically, Leilei figures out how to control Gate magic and they start opening Gates to try and find their way back to Japan and end up finding other alternate universes instead.    Bozes and Tomita have a kid though, so make of that what you will regarding Itami and his ever-growing harem. </br>  <br>did you miss the pol bait threads?</br>  <br>Why would that annoy you? Unless you base your own opinions on what /a/ thinks....?</br>  <br>I rather watch 1 mirrion Obama swordsmen than any redpilling /pol/ shit like oni-sama!</br>  He has the pendant, what if by mistake EMIYA appeared instead of Gil?<br><br>He would probably have won.<br><br>None of the other servants would have any chance against EMIYA.<br><br>Saber would be pwned easily.<br><br>Also the Holy Grail wouldn't have burned the city, thus making this Shirou Emiya having a normal life and not becoming Archer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The exact same thing that happened to him when he had gil: death by Kirei.</br>  <br>Why would EMIYA betray him? I'm sure he would remember Kirei and I'm sure he hates him too.</br>  <br>Emiya is an average Servant that is good at being Batman.</br>  <br>Archer<br><br>Going against his dad AND Saber<br><br>Anta baka?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kirei would have withdrawn from the war if he hadn't been sitting in on Gil's philosophy class.</br>  <br>Emiya only won in Round 5 because his fight with Shirou made him pissed off enough to kill everyone else. In HF and Fate he does well, but ultimately performs pretty poorly.<br>I mean, let's be real here, he had the will to kill everyone in his way just to shit on this kid, and he still lost the War.<br><br><br>You don't need a betrayal for death by Kirei.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kariya would have died from being transformed into bacon.</br>  <br>Archer can beat everyone in 4th war.<br>Well not everyone(JETS) but he can make some tough fuckers kill each other(Saber fight JETS).<br><br>When any of the other servants of the 4th war has a chance of killing Heracles 5 times without using their hougu (pretty much the same as him not using UBW, except UBW is more broken) then you can tell me they can beat archer.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rider gets hrunted<br><br>Caster dies like he did.<br><br>Lancer is shit<br><br>Saber can't win against him.<br><br>Lancelot can probably beat him but I don't know. Best chance here is making Lancelot and Saber fight then kill the one who wins.<br><br>Assassin is shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also<br><br>Archer&gt;Kiritsugu<br>He would read all of kerry's shenanigans and beat him playing the same game</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do people think EMIYA could beat Saber?</br>  <br>Because he can? Unless she has Avalon he's stronger.<br><br>He's not going to get in laser beam range since he's not dumb and he knows everything there is to know about her.</br></br></br>  <br>Hes Nasu's Batman.<br><br>Pulls some bullshit out of his ass to beat someone he has no business beating because TACTICS.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not tactics.<br><br>He's just strong AND batman.<br>He didn't kill heracles all those times with tactics</br></br></br></br>  <br> he's not dumb </br>  <br>Why would Archer want to win a war he knows has no point?<br><br>why do you think he never wins in SN? He just doesn't care.<br>He knows all the masters and he knows all the servants, he can tell rin and kill them all.<br>He doesn't want to.<br><br>He can tell Tokiomi about the grail and about Sakura. Then Tokiomi being a retard would try to deny the fact that grail is shit, Archer would kill him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hercules said Archer's swordsmanship was so good that it gave him a sword boner and made Hercules regret being summoned as a Berserker.<br><br>Archer was acknowledged by Hercules</br></br></br>  <br>He'd probably just follow Kerry around to see how he was like.</br>  <br>The real question is:<br><br>What if Kerry had summoned EMIYA?<br>I want to see that so much</br></br></br></br>  <br>What would kerry use as a catalyst?</br>  <br>Nothing.<br><br>It's his son. They also have similar personalities</br></br></br>  <br>What if Shirou summoned EMIYA?<br><br>He can use his penis as catalyst no?</br></br></br>  <br>What would hercules know about swordmanship? He was known for carrying around a gigantic wooden club with which he beat dudes to death.</br>  <br>Shirou will always summon Saber 'cause Avalon.</br>  <br>In Nasuverse, Hercules used 9 Lives with his club and basically anything he got his hands on.<br><br>9 Lives is Hercules's swordsmanship.<br><br>It is Hercules's everything and can be applied to anything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 2006+9 <br> There's people that still don't understand Archer class is known for "he can end the war but doesn't fucking want to" </br></br>  <br>Sometimes errors happen in the world which causes things to go in an unintended way even without the proper set up. Kind of like in SMT games when you get a fusion error.<br><br>Like in the most recent drama CD, where Medea accidentally summoned Nero.<br><br>Shirou himself is just an error in the world, they aren't too uncommon.<br><br>Might take some million different world lines, but mistakes happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Phoenix Wright got an anime?<br><br>No but seriously guy looks like Edgeworth from afar just with darker hair and no cravat.</br></br></br>  <br>Tokiomi still fucks up somewhere really important.<br><br><br>Tell that Robin, Chiron and Atlanta</br></br></br></br>  <br>EMIYA is a shit tier servant even with a perfect master.<br>He'd be even worse with fucking Tokiomi as master</br></br>    <br>In a fight, who would win, Hercules with his gigantic wooden club, or Andrew 'Bitches don't know about my stick' Jackson?</br>  <br>He hasn't won a single fight.</br>  <br> buttmad Saberfag <br><br>every time</br></br></br>  <br> He can tell Tokiomi about the grail and about Sakura. <br>If that was really such a big deal to Aacha, why didn't he do anything about it in FSN, and what would be different in Zero that he would act differently?</br></br>  <br>He won against Gil, anon.</br>  <br> literaly useless if the enemy isn't mindlessly running towards you </br>  <br>Andrew would be invincible if it was a one on one duel<br><br>If you challenge him to a duel then you're already dead. His endurance shoots up three ranks and he can ignore blows while giving you a fatal hit in turn.</br></br></br>  <br>Because he doesn't want to?<br><br>The only one he lost and he actually wanted to win was the shadow</br></br></br>  <br>Herc would force Andrew to pay denbts.</br>  <br>Andrew would wail on Herc so hard that the cabinet would have to pull him off.</br>  <br> Because he doesn't want to? <br>Wow.<br>Archerfags<br><br>Denial isn't just a river in egypt</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dont think EMYA can kill Rider.</br>    <br> I dont think EMYA can kill Rider. <br>Literally anyone can kill 4th''s rider.</br></br>  <br>That's nearly as pathetic as counting "Assassin's" wins in HF where the Shadow plays plot</br>  If Gilgamesh is the strongest Servant, and EMIYA can functionally do pretty much the same thing Gil can but better, and Shirou can do the pretty much the same thing EMIYA can, does that mean Shirou is stronger than any Servant?  <br>Hrunting</br>  <br>No.<br>Do you intentionaly ignore the "I can ONLY beat Gil" lines?</br></br>  <br>Hrunting isn't strong.<br>Did you even read that scene in HA?</br></br>  <br>No.<br><br>Shirou can't.<br><br>Archer can beat a fair share of servants. The one that gives him most trouble in 5th war is probably lancer.<br>Not even berserker.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you familiar with rock, paper, scissors?</br>  <br>Those didn't make sense.</br>  <br> Hrunting isn't strong <br><br>please shut up.<br><br>Also Iskandar is not strong either, Zero servants are all weaker than SN not counting Saber of course</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Assassin notes that Shadow isn't on his side, it would just as soon kill him as anything else nearby. It's nothing more than a stage hazard. <br><br>He lures other servants close to the stage hazard, and tries to bank on their pride getting the best of them as they don't retreat immediately.<br><br>What he's doing is entirely fair, and within tactics.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No they do make sense.<br>You just chose not to believe them because they contradict your headcanon</br></br>  Much better question is, how hard everyone around is fucked against this combo?<br>Mage that can kill any other mage.<br>Versatile as fuck servant who can straight assassinate masters from a distance.</br></br>  <br>Wait are you actualy defending the Shadow as a plot device?</br>  <br>Lancer, Berserker, and Rider say hello</br>  <br>Let's assume that for some reason Archer actually wants to help Kiritsugu win.<br><br>They win.</br></br></br>  <br>Bazett and Lancer would win easily.</br>  <br>I agree, servant fights should be no noble phantasms saber only</br>  <br>He doesn't use UBW against Berserker or Lancer. He still kills berserker 5 times. Which part of he didn't want to win the war was difficult to understand?<br><br>Rider in HF? That was because of the field</br></br></br>  <br> He doesn't use UBW against Berserker or Lancer. <br>Dude just stop<br> Against a normal opponent this is little more than a mildly annoying ability, but it is the natural enemy of a certain King of Heroes. </br></br></br>  <br>Why can't Shirou?</br>  <br> Also the Holy Grail wouldn't have burned the city, thus making this Shirou Emiya having a normal life and not becoming Archer. <br>That's the reason why he can't summon EMIYA</br></br>  <br>Same guy each time, go fuck yourself trying to turn what we're talking about into "I hate shadow, its a terrible anything, Nasu also hates it confirmed, oh wait it was confirmed he actually liked it a lot?, doesn't count, everyone hates it, its the worst anything, it sucks, don't defend it its just objectively bad and sucks and everything".<br><br>Can't mention it without that same autist showing up and trying to be an autist.<br><br>No that's clearly not what was being talked about in that last post. The last post was entirely about how Hassan in 5th war had victories that counted because he used strategy. Has nothing to do with how it worked, it was all him luring the opponent into fucking themselves up and it worked.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Bazett and Lancer <br>Caladbolg'd to death.</br></br>  <br> He doesn't use UBW against Berserker or Lancer. <br>It is borderline useless against anyone who isn't Gil<br> Rider in HF? That was because of the field <br>No he gets petrified by her eyes.<br><br> b-but he didn't want to win </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hed try to stop dad from saving him and thus would kill himself like he tried to do in fate stay.</br>  Archer probably would have pissed off Saber, Lancer, and Rider because of his complete lack of chivalry or heroic honor.<br><br>I would love to see Emiya VS Lancelot though. I think Archer would have definitely saved Sakura if he was in the 4th war.</br></br>  <br>Just beat EMIYA with superior firepower</br>  <br>You actualy think only one person dislikes the Shadow?</br>  <br>Why do you always take like ten times the words to say stuff than it requires</br>  <br>There is literally no way for him to beat Lancer who isn't being fucked by a command seal.<br><br>To be fair relatively few people could.<br><br>Hell Archer was lucky as shit that war, he was the only servant to not be actively fucked by a shitty master.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you dumb? Seriously are you dumb?<br><br>He can project more weapons to kill Heracles all the time he needs you retard.<br><br>Against Lancer he didn't have any mana nor his intention was to EVER win the fight. <br><br>Do you go through the VN with ctrl? Hell even the anime implied he didn't want to win against Lancer at any point and that he didn't have much mana anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I think Archer would have definitely saved Sakura if he was in the 4th war. <br>You base that on?<br>He didn't give a shit about her in HF and was trying to kill her before he got BTFO by Rider</br></br></br>  <br>Because he's nasu</br>  <br>He doesn't use UBW against anyone you mouthbreather. Using UBW or not is not an indicator of him going all-out. He's at his strongest when he uses tactics, not swinging swords around like a nut.</br>  <br> Ranged attacks  <br> Against the Choo Choo baby <br>Oh you</br></br></br>  <br>It's only one guy that goes autist on it in the same way with the same words each time. Tr</br>  <br> Are you dumb? Seriously are you dumb? <br>Considering you are actively disregarding Word of God i'd return that question<br> Against Lancer he didn't have any mana <br>Dude he was powered by Caster<br> Hell even the anime implied he didn't want to win against Lancer at any point and that he didn't have much mana anymore. <br>What part indicated that?<br>And yes he obviously didn't have mana anymore after the Aias got busted by Gae Bolg</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He was going to kill Rider before the Field kicked in and then Rider used the Mystic Eyes.<br><br>Read it again.<br><br><br>He knows everything about lancer, he can just use Rho Aias and defend himself against Gae Bolg. <br>That is if he actually has a master and if his intention is to actually win the fight. He didn't want to kill Lancer in that fight at he church.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The 5th Wars anti-Emiya is Rider since the Pegasus since he doesn't have enough mp for those delicious A++ BPs. Second is technically Assassin due to some absurd terrain advantage stopping Archer from just sniping him.</br>  <br>Lancer has no protection against AOE.<br>Caladbolg is a huge and powerful AOE which he can launch from a distance not even aiming at Lancer directly.<br>Even if it won't kill him it will obviously kill Bazett.</br></br></br>  <br> he can just use Rho Aias and defend himself against Gae Bolg. <br>Oh yeah that turned out so well.<br>Archerfags are worse than Shikifags</br></br></br>  <br> The result was Preta! </br>  Face the facts. Archer knows every single servant identity.<br><br>He is 1000 steps ahead of everybody.</br></br>  <br>Fucking bullshit son of a whore</br>  <br>Word of god says Shirou can't trace cool shit when we see him trace Caliburn and fucking Avalon.<br><br><br>Word of god means nothing</br></br></br></br>  <br> He is 1000 steps ahead of everybody. <br>And he still loses every fight.<br>That should tell you something</br></br></br>  <br><br>OP there's a upcoming novel that depicts this scenario but I can't for the life of my find it.

Emiya isn't even above average. He's only especially strong against Gil. He'd get fucking trashed in the fourth war without being part of a significant team.</br>  <br>Not even same dude but this is kinda dumb.<br>Archer is hellish strong, definetely stronger than 4th war servants.Or do you mean because of the stats? those mean shit and we all know it, especially with Archer's hability when using NP.<br>Hell the fact that he can kill basaka is proof enough.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, look, Emiya loses when he doesn't use all of his tools.<br>SERVANTS AREN'T SUPPOSED TO USE EVERY ABILITY IN EVERY FIGHT</br></br>  <br> Didn't use rho aias that can deflect normal gae bolg easily <br>Dude no<br> Takeuchi: So, would Archer get hit? <br> Nasu: For sure. But since he knows about it, he wouldn’t approach Lancer in the first place. If it looked like Lancer was seriously getting ready to use Gae Bolg, Archer would already be frantically getting as far away as possible. <br>CM 3<br> doesn't use all his arsenal <br>You base that on?<br> Fanfiction tier, he can just trace more and more powerful NP <br>I'm counting what he did not what your fanfiction says<br> No he doesn't <br>Please read the fucking VN<br> Doesn't want to fight and kill Cu <br>that is literaly never said<br><br> the rest <br>b-but he didn't want to beat them</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How about the one where he snipes saber in F/HA <br>You mean the one where he tries to snipe Shirou and Saber easily destroys the first 4 Hruntings?</br></br>  <br>If you can somehow convince Emiya to actually fight the war in earnest, it doesn't matter how shit his master is since he will pretty much turn into Kiritsugu and use any means to win. Stats don't really mean shit for him when Mind's Eye basically means he can hold his own even when way over his head, and his skillset is bullshit enough that he can kill Heracles 5 times in melee. <br><br><br>To be fair, Nasu mentions Archer would have gotten out of range if Lancer really tried using Gae Bolg, and the Saber fight wasn't really much of a fight since he was too busy having flashbacks of her. Also, killing Berserker 5 times in melee is far more impressive than what practically every other Servant in the war can do save for a full-power Saber and maybe Cu, and he's pretty much never serious save when he finally tries to kill Shirou, or when he notices shit is getting real in HF.</br></br></br></br>  Archer killed Heracles 6 times.<br><br>Just wanted to correct that to he ones saying it's 5</br></br>  <br> He enjoys battle, and he would have grieved that his match with Archer "deserved better" had he been a normal Servant. He displays a brief sense of rationality while thinking this, wishing to have matched sword techniques with Archer to his heart's content and passed a satisfying time. </br>  <br> Nasu mentions Archer would have gotten out of range if Lancer really tried using Gae Bolg, <br>that's a nice formulation for "run as away as fast as he can against the fastest servant  besides Achilles "</br></br>  <br> literaly quoting the wiki <br>Just kill yourself</br></br>  <br>It's not wrong so why would I not quote it?<br><br>I'm not going to play Fate again to find a screenshot mouthbreather</br></br></br>  <br>I want people to tell me the servant aside from Archer than killed Heracles 6 times in melee.<br><br>Six times in melee, please tell me a few names.</br></br></br>  <br>It's an incredibly good tactic so long as Cu can't maintain the Gae Bolg charge while he's running after Archer.</br>  <br>Considering he drops the stance and jumps towards the enemy before using it I don't think Archer's tactic works that perfectly.<br><br>Gilgamesh does 12<br>Saber with one Strike of caliburn does 7</br></br></br></br>  <br>Even Atalanta is effectively faster than Cu.</br>  <br>Emiya Shirou/Seibah. 7 times in one strike.</br>  <br> in melee </br>  <br>In that case Herakles jobbed too fast for others to do it.</br>  <br> Melee <br> Gil <br> Killing anything <br><br>Sure a team-up and it's said several times it was becaus the two of them did it. <br>And I should say that Archer can do something similar since he can trace Caliburn too.<br><br>Now tell me anyone else</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You know how Archer told Rin to spend the war in her basement?  <br> And I should say that Archer can do something similar since he can trace Caliburn too. <br>No he can't.</br></br>  <br> Shirou can <br> Archer can't <br>'k i'm out</br></br></br>  <br> Now tell me anyone else <br>There are only 3 routes.<br>Fate: Jobs against Saber/Shirou<br>UBW: Jobs against Gil<br>HF: Jobs against the Shadow, Jobs even harder against Shirou afterwards</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only in the anime, and even then that was probably still within it's 10-meter range. Cu has never been shown charging Gae Bolg while on the move (outside of the technicality of his throwing it in midair).<br><br><br>He should have it in UBW considering Shirou does, and unlike in Fate he had no Saber dreams to see it there. Not that it matters since Caliburn having that level of power is a one-time deal only possible because Saber was holding it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you completly miss the context of that scene?<br>Caliburn by itself doesn't do shit.<br>It was the "Miracle of being reunited with it's owner" that made the 7kill strike possible</br></br></br>  Something I can't understand.<br><br>I mean I know Nasu sucks at writing things without plotholes but hey.<br><br>Why doesn't Archer has Avalon as a NP? Say what you want but the dude has it on his fucking body since forever.<br>It doesn't make 1 bit of sense him not having Avalon's powers or something like that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>did you not read the many times where he is successful</br>  <br>Avalon doesn't do anything without Saber around.<br><br>Likewise, he might simply have lost it. I think only UBW Shirou gets to keep it.</br></br></br>  <br> Only in the anime, <br>Read the fucking VN<br><br> The beast jumps. <br> Lancer instantly appears in front of the girl, as if he teleported, and… <br> Thrusts his lance at the girl's feet. <br><br> "" <br> It was a bad move, even to my eyes. <br> With the lance already lowered, it wouldn't be effective to aim low at the girl. <br> To prove my point, the girl jumps over the lance and moves forward to slash Lancer away. <br> At that moment. <br> Gae... <br> Bolg <br><br>And he covers 30 meters in "an instant" with one jump in the VN</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Avalon only works while connected to Saber in some way. Outside of that, the image essentially "fades away".</br>  <br>You mean the ones where he kills Avenger while he sucks at imitating Shirou?</br>  <br>Fate <br>Plot bullshit.<br>UBW<br>Enkidu, okay sure but he rekt Saber before. Hard<br>HF: Everyone loses against the shadow what's your point?. <br>And who's ARM(one fucking arm) is giving Shirou power to kill Berserker?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I think only UBW Shirou gets to keep it <br><br>Avalon prevents you from aging, right? Does that mean Shirou has eternal youth in the Good End?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't understand how people can say this. We got more than enough proof to realize Archer is really good at fighting, thinking and using his broken projections</br>  Can Archer beat anyone in melee combat?  <br>He'd get wrecked if he goes and fights like a Saber instead of Hrunting everybody's ass from a safe place like the Tohsaka manor.<br><br>We all know he's not going to do the latter, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Berserker<br>Gilgamesh<br>Medea<br>Medusa<br>For some reason not Saber even tho she's weaker than Berserker</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lancer and Saber would wreck his ass unless he starts symphatizing abilities from other weapons which is what he probably did to somewhat survuve Hec</br>  <br>Even if his stats aren't the highest, his skills are noted to be top notch, to the point that even Saber must admire his purity.<br><br>He kicks Hassan away without even trying in HF<br><br>Julius in Extra says he's a servant who excels in drawn out battles. Not sure you get if if you're asking, but he is a master of his blade, without tracing anyone elses abilities. If he was simply tracing he could never match another master, he can only match masters because he too has learned his style completely.<br><br>Anyone who hasn't mastered their style cannot fight him in melee.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Medea <br>Anon please</br></br>  <br> For some reason not Saber even tho she's weaker than Berserker <br>Maybe because Berserker doesn't have any technique?<br> unless he starts symphatizing abilities from other weapons <br>Copying other people won't help him he has to rely on his own skills/techniques<br><br> He kicks Hassan away without even trying in HF <br>Yeah but that's Hassan#<br> Anyone who hasn't mastered their style cannot fight him in melee. <br>That is so fucking stupid considering we're talking about servants</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I still don't understand how Archer was able to kill Berserker even once. It doesn't make any sense.  <br>He asked.<br>I just listed the ones he can.<br><br>He can't Lancer for sure.<br><br>I won't believe he can't beat Saber in Melee because of what I said about him beating Heracles while Saber can't do anyhing against him.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's really strong?</br>  <br>Woops, for some reason I thought it was the opposite. My bad.</br>  <br>My bad, meant you were talking about that dumb scene with him breaking through the ground like some bulldozer. Regardless, the fight in Shirou's backyard is still damn close range and (more importantly) still doesn't show him charging Gae Bolg while on the move. Nasu makes no mentions of whether Archer's attempts to break the fight would end in either result, so there's still grounds to believe it's possible. <br><br><br>He stands a good fight against anyone who isn't like Saber/Lancer and aren't complete masters themselves. Even then, he still won't lose just because Mind's Eye can make up for the difference in stats/skill.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know why you're replying to me what other anon said.</br>  <br> Emiya <br>We should note that this is an Archer class Servant. He does surprisingly well in close range for any non-Gilgamesh of his class.</br></br>  <br> Tohsaka's my Master? Yes, YES----- <br> fuck, it's her dad <br> tfw your lifelong partner is a little 6 year old girl <br> tfw your dad is alive and being a mega edgelord cheating on his wife instead being of a hero <br> tfw your sister isn't even in Japan <br> only 1 female Servant <br> no exclusive female Masters <br>Yeah, fuck the 4th War.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And faggots like you are the ones saying Archer is weak.<br><br>He's just strong, there's nothing weird about it. He's fucking strong, intelligent and has a large arsenal of useful weapons. That's it.</br></br></br>  <br>Berserker against normal servants wins because they're really good at one thing; the servant will do that one thing, kill one live and then lose.<br>Archer gets to kill him many times because <br>a) he has many weapons<br>b) Berserker doesn't bother to parry attacks a normal servant would</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rin wasn't his partner</br>  <br>gar</br>  <br>At minimum, that quote is very alike the one from the VN.</br>  <br>People really hype up "Can trace abilities and stats" when that's not how it works. He's not ditto who can have A+ in all stats if he wants. There's a reason he doesn't use the whole "Tracing others abilities or skills" so much as a servant when he's perfected his style. Tracing someones skill he can only get to maybe a 7 on the scale, a master is at a 10 on the scale, he's more suited to just using his own custom fighting style that he's created along the way where he's also a 10 in it. Gilgamesh has a 4 in skill, but a 15 in firepower.<br><br>Tracing someones fighting ability to fight another master of their blade, it would surely lose. Tracing Arthur's ability to fight Lancer, or Lancer's ability to fight Arthur, he'd surely lose. Against a true master of their craft, an imitation of someone's craft could never help him match up. Its not his style, it doesn't fit his body like his own style does, its just an imitation, its not him knowing it inside and out but rather just mimicking the form, there's a difference between mastery and simple imitation. A master would know everything about it inside and out.<br><br>He can use different weapons to figure out a path to beat others, but if he wants to match a master in close combat its gotta be in his own field.<br><br><br> That is so fucking stupid considering we're talking about servants <br><br>Any caster would probably lose in Melee, aside from maybe Tamamo who's also mastered CQC ironically, or Cu. Gilgamesh hasn't mastered his melee skills so he can't compare to Emiya who can fight up close on his own, but Gilgamesh has his own skills that let him had the edge on others.<br><br>Whether Archer can beat another master of their craft is a toss up depending on pure skill.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Berserker does bother to parry tho.<br><br>He protected himself against Caladbolg II because he noticed it would kill him</br></br></br>  <br>Oh right.<br>Then maybe Archer uses lots of distraction to take him by surprise, or attacks from many angles at once.</br></br>  <br>Was he at peak condition at this time?</br>  <br> aside from maybe Tamamo who's also mastered CQC ironically <br>She's directly mentioned to be shit at CQC in Extra<br>Also pretty sure there are a lot of potential Caster's who are good in melee.</br></br></br>  <br>Tamamo of the Crotch Kick Explosion style of fighting<br><br>Castration is her specialty</br></br></br>  <br>She mastered a fighting style inbetween Extra and CCC. Her strongest attack in the game is now a melee.<br><br>She talked about learning this move in the seventh week of Extra.<br><br>Her fighting ability isn't too bad, she's about the only Caster that won't die immediately in close combat. Against enemy servants and random viruses she stands up tall with her little hand mirror. Her combat ability sucks as per Casters, but among Caster's she stands out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who?<br><br>Berserker? Yes.<br>Or Archer? He was ok but he didn't use UBW that could help him take a few more lifes maybe</br></br></br></br>  <br>That was immediately post-Archer fight. He got killed so many times so quickly his regen was just kicking in and he was somehow thinking lucidly compared to his normal madness. <br><br><br>And shown to somehow hold her own versus a fucking Saber in CQC.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't remember. It should be noted that ANY Archer minus Gil would have a far harder time in close range.</br>    <br>Please never again argue with Game mechanics<br> Also the reason why any off your servants win even one match is that Hakuno is the bestest ever who could win a grail war with Avenger </br></br>  <br>Gil would just get killed in close range. In like 2 swings or something</br>  <br>She's a Caster who stood up to Gawain in close combat, withstood and blocked his blows, and managed to come out ahead.<br><br>She's also a Caster who managed to magic blast someone with the same magic resistance as Saber in F/SN to death. Completely breaking the dragons magic resistance.<br><br><br> "These things didn't happen, they don't count" <br><br>Except they did happen, it was an entire point that your servant fought these people who had these skills in particular.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He was ok but he didn't use UBW that could help him take a few more lifes maybe <br>It's borderline useless against anyone but Gil.</br></br>  <br>Of course. MC is broken as fuck that's why you can kill everything on extra.<br><br>I really want to play CCC why the fuck is it not translated?<br>Extra looks awesome on my phone</br></br></br></br>  <br>Likely so but Gil's the kind of guy who would use Enkidu or a weapon like Ea if ever forced to go close range against Berserker-Herakles.</br>  <br> ANY Archer minus Gil <br>Gil is absolute shit at close range. Any redheaded high school kid with a week's worth of training could easily beat Goldie in a sword fight.</br></br>  <br>Its maybe being translated, but it'll take ages.<br><br>If you're impatient, there's a blog that has most of a route translated.<br><br>https://tsukinoura.wordpress.com/<br><br>Game has almost as much text as F/SN, plot custom written by Nasu as his big project recently, and probably too lewd for western audience.<br><br>This is some ultimate level lewd right here</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> borderline <br>Well said. It can give him the edge in speed and distracting enemies with sword showers while he plans/traces something powerful enough.<br><br>It's not useless, you fags can't understand that it's not all about direct power, if it was like that then he would be like gilgamesh.<br><br>I doubt he can kill Berserker 12 times but a few more yeah</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gil's at least average in melee.<br>He relies on hard counter though.</br></br>  <br>He is but this is considering a Gil with crap like Ea &amp; not being overwhelmed. if Shirou have Gil enough room to breathe then Gil would have won.</br>  One thing that's great in CCC, the interaction between the cast is way up since they're all working together from the start and playing off of each other.    <br>Enkidu would work but taking Ea would result in his arm getting btfo like shirou did</br>  <br>Two weeks. And he technically cheated since he stole a lifetime's worth of CQC skills from his future Servant self within those two weeks.</br>    <br>Considering that Gawain is in charge of cooking, this implies that everyone else is worse.</br>  <br>I thought Shirou survived the fire due to Avalon being put into him by Kiritsugu, but wouldn't it have already become practically useless by that point since Saber was gone then?</br>  <br>Not always. Gil didn't have Ea ready initially &amp; had to pull it out.</br>  <br> I mean I know Nasu sucks at writing things without plotholes but hey. </br>  <br>Well, he was disconnected from a master and receiving little to no mana at all.</br>  <br> fuse it into something else <br> five minutes later <br> preta in the field <br> preta used macca beam! <br><br>GOD DAMN FUCKING SHIT SON OF A BITCH KARMA</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was one of his key traits anon, I mean the author is retarded and doesn't know what smart is but he is supposed to be.</br>  <br>[crotch violence intensifies]</br>  <br>Supposedly it still had a little bit of her mana left in it. It's the reason why it healed him there and then stopped doing shit during the rest of his life.</br>  <br>He still had to be hospitalized. Avalon probably had a minimal effect at best.</br>  <br> he can kill basaka <br>when did that happen?</br></br>  <br>No, he just felt like making it that day because he always thought he was the best back in the day, since Arthur never had the heart to tell him he sucked. He tells stories about how Arthur sat in front of his cooking with dead eyes unable to say a word as she slowly ate, clearly she loved it.<br><br>Sakura, EMIYA, and Tamamo seem to be the types that can cook well.<br><br>Gatou, Leo, maybe Rin and Julius have very minimal skills at best<br><br>Gawain and Elizabeth are the worst at this but can't realize it themselves.<br><br>When the Student Council is just shooting the breeze one day they think about opening up a cafeteria to make things a bit more fresh here, and experience the dorm life style a bit more. While talking it over they sort of realize none of them can cook too much. Rin seems to have the basics down, Gatou can only make rice gruel, Gawain is a vegetarian who only believes in quantity, and Julius cooks curry out of an oil drum when he's on the road.<br><br>They have to keep things light and joke around because the situation is so hopefulness, yet they try to stay upbeat.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, CCC has a translation?</br>   Snipes the shit out of everyone in HA <br> Again and again <br> On every damn loop <br> The only way Saber was able to beat him there was through nearly infinite repeat and error where after getting her shit sniped every time she finally found a infinitely small opening she could finally exploit <br> And even then it was just barely <br><br>How in the flying fuck people think Archer is a weak servant is beyond me. Damn secondaries.<br><br> If he's so strong why didn't he win the HGW then? <br>In case you did not notice, which you most likely did not because you are a secondary retard literally no fucking Servant of the 5th, except Miss MUH BRITAIN gave a fuck about the Holy Grail. The 5th is a fucking joke of Holy Grail War.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Archer and Kerry do not have an ultimate attack. Unless you count the totally useless STRENGTH MOVES MOUNTAINS thing.</br>  <br>Keep dreaming</br>  <br>Fuck.</br>  <br>Fate</br>  <br>You forgot Team BAHSAKAH also wanted to win the war, well the old man.</br>  <br>He kills Berserker several times in the Fate route.</br>  <br>Caster is most definitely his master during that fight. <br> being this retarded </br></br>  <br>Rin can cook in Stay Night. If that matters</br>  <br>Don't bother.<br><br>People still say Archer can't beat anyone and he's weak.</br></br></br>  <br>They really are retarded. Even if they have noble phantasms, he has an infinity of them.Even if each of them were a tenth of the strength of each noble phantasm, infinity/10 still equals infinity.</br>  Has there ever been a HGW where everyone is actually fighting for the Holy Grail instead of being nothing but retarded petty squabbles?  <br> because he always thought he was the best back in the day <br>But what if Arthur allowed him to because everyone else was worse?</br></br>  <br>The third one?</br>  <br>I like when people actually know what they're talking about.<br>Thanks</br></br>  <br>Where are anti-archer fags now?

Many people comment on coming for the fetish and staying for the story. The battle system is sort of fun.

It has a whole slew of artists working on it, some doing more traditional monster girls, some doing unspeakable abominations better not shown in here, and some that are basically just draw animals with a naked female torso with a head slapped on top of it. The good monster girls make the bad ones endurable, for the most part.<br><br>As for the plot, it's pretty good for an H-game at the very least. The protagonist is more beta than Shinji, though. Thank god he's way more Alpha in Paradox.</br></br></br>  <br> Likewise, Luz and Polt shouldn't have had to have been Furries. <br><br>To be fair, Luz is a shapeshifter and Polt is a Kobold, we've seen dog girls and wolf girls in the universe and they're clearly Kenomimi's.</br></br></br>  <br>It became a blogging front though <br>so apples and oranges <br>KS was good though</br></br></br>  <br> Centaur <br> liking horse pussy <br><br><br>The correct order is<br>zombie &gt; slime &gt; shapeshifter &gt; ms smith &gt; polt &gt; anyone else (make it up, i don't really care about the others that much) &gt; centaur</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's the only eroge I actually flapped to</br>  <br>A Suu body pillow could be revolutionary if a great mind would work on it.</br>  <br> Cerea last.  <br>Anon, fite me.</br></br>  <br>How can one person have so much shit taste?</br>  <br><br>Yeah, all of them are worse than Snek.</br></br>  <br><br>The evil in men's hearts.</br></br>   Monster Musume airs <br> Suddenly a VN featuring a cyclops girls pops up and gets interest despite noone gave a fuck before. </br>  <br>I understand not liking horse pussy<br>but why the hell are all your top picks so close to the regular human sex experience?<br>Do you not want Miia to coil around you and fuck for 8 hours without stopping?<br>She won't get tired you know, snake muscles are strong, she will keep milking you dry.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's a joke, right?

Shit's insane</br>  <br>/a/ does have a garbage little IRC channel for osu on Rizon, iirc. Maybe add that if you remember the name.</br>  Did you like the new opening and ending songs?  No and no  The first ending was great, it managed to get me hyped for the next episode every time. This one is just "fine"  ED visulas were saved thanks to based Nao.  Its decent but I loved the old ED especially the ending of it.  Opening is better but ending song is alright.  SHIT they changed the OP and ED?<br><br>I accidently conditioned myself to eat a specific meal while watching this show. <br><br>I freak out if i dont watch the Op while eating.</br></br></br></br>  The OP is really good<br>Especially the part where Megumi orgasms while tomatoes are raining</br>  I feel the new OP fits really well for all the stuff that's going to happen soon.  Not nearly as much as the previous OP/ED. Good episode though, I'm hyped as shit for next one  <br> being this autistic </br>  <br>Didn't like the songs for either, but liked the visuals of the new ED.</br>   They replaced the glorious first opening with this shit. <br>WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYY.</br>  They're really good. The last ED was overrated as hell, the only good part of it was the changing faces every episode.  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ERINA!  I've never watched the entire OP for this show  <br> First opening <br> Glorious <br>It was shit</br></br></br>  I don't understand how anyone could possible prefer the first OP over this one.  Spot the  otp   Full color chapter is out.<br>http://imgur.com/a/8jmzj<br>Shit scans never.</br></br>  <br>If the characters in the ladle indeed change, I figure Isami will be visible then and these guys will be turned around.</br>    <br>All I can see is Hisako's butt and that slutty look on her face like she desperately wants some cock.</br>  I like the new OP, it's kinda spoily for Animeonlyfags tho.    <br>why the fuck is meat in there<br>that makes me mad as fuck</br></br>  <br>Souma's dad beat you to it.</br>  <br>This.<br>Ibusaki and Marui got even a higher score than her.</br></br>  Souma reaching top 5 and Erina moving to the polar star when?  I want Kanon to appear in the festival.<br>A maid cafe would be good too.</br>  <br>she's the love interest</br>  <br>Both OP are ok, but the first one is glorious and for comparision this one is shit.</br>  <br> I want Kanon to appear in the festival. <br><br> Kanon visits Soma's booth <br> Soma and Megumi offer her their food <br> she's all happy seeing them again and eating their food <br> Soma sees Erina passing by <br> "Oi, Nakiri!" <br> Erina and Kanon respond   "Nani?" <br> everyon'es face when </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, the irrelevant one.</br>   There are people that don't pick Yuki   <br>They literally could not have picked a worse ending song. I didn't think i'd be able to hate vocals that bad in an OP/ED song since fear and loathing in Las Vegas</br>  <br><br> no more fuwa fuwa <br><br>Fucking dropped</br></br></br></br>  Holy fuck that voice on whoever sings the ED, what the fuck she sounds pretty annoying  It's the nasally vocals that put people off from the new OP, right? You guys probably don't like Nano Ripe, either.<br><br>I can see why it's a bit of an acquired taste, but I like it.</br></br>  <br>It's better than the last OP, not that that means much</br>  I TOLD YOU ALL<br>I TOLD YOU ERINA AND SOMA ARE SIBLINGS<br>YOU DIDN'T LISTEN</br></br>  <br> animeonlyfags </br>  <br>is anime your autism medicine</br>  <br>animeonlyfags, everybody</br>  <br>They aren't.</br>  <br>are you fucking retarded</br>  <br>ED's not that bad, but the OP is tragic.</br>  <br> Erina <br> living in some dorm like a commoner <br><br>I'd like to see grandpa slap the shit out of her with an eviction to Polar Star</br></br></br></br>  <br>Has her own money. Has a job that pays extremely well. Has connections and high level of business acumen.<br><br>In short order she would buy, remodel, and stock the polar star dorm with servants without even needing her family's money.</br></br></br>  オオオオオオ lives on.  Did they add a lot of anime only scenes or was it just me  Does the new OP mean were going to end at the end of the Autumn Election? Looks like it from the moon. <br>Either way, I'm fucking hype.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3i_<wbr>0j4vFnUk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I dig the ED. You just have to listen to it a few more times.</br></br>  <br>No, we'll get only the preliminaries. Gigga Nigga wasn't even in the OP.</br>  Casanova is out.  <br>Finally.</br>  <br>http://casanovascans.com/read/shoku<wbr>geki_no_soma/en/0/127/page/1<br><br>wow how come so fast compared to last week?</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Because Jump came out early this week for some reason.</br>  <br><br>Was wondering how they would have pulled off like 50chapters, but alright, I'm down. I want the Election to be thoroughly adapted, so let's hope for S2.</br></br>   surstroming  <br><br>jesus christ</br></br>   he does it for free   <br>These lyrics are fucking weird.</br>  <br>The Alice trio scene was great.<br><br>Also, Nao a cute.</br></br></br>  So Ryou with his flattering is like a bad influence for Alice.  What Souma is planning? God damn it, I really want to know. <br>I can't wait for the next chapter.</br>  <br>I just like how he's basically saying "hey, you don't have to mean it, just do it".</br>  why doesn't casanova just put the translations in the full color pages  <br>We still need to know whom he gave a key to and why, along with what's happened with Eizan and Rindou.</br>  <br>Because it's far harder to clean.</br>  <br>It's hell to redraw color pages.</br>  They were both shit. The ending specially so.  <br>I don't know much about that process but I figure redraws are harder?</br>  <br>Yeah. The first OP is one of the worst I ever seen (sound wise)</br>  <br>Hand was mysterious girl from chapter 117.</br>  <br>Probably a man's hand. It was the same size as Souma's and notably larger than Megumi's on the same page.</br>  <br>how do you tell</br>  <br>She was the only background character that wasn't full colored in the color chapter. Same with Yugi and Nene.</br>  So is Souma gonna be able to marry Erina knowing that everytime they fuck, she's gonna be thinking of his dad?  So they skipped the introduction of the AE which means half of the dialogue is going to be original. Gonna be wierd.  I like this OP more. Builds anticipation for the tournament really nicely.<br><br>The ED is okay I guess, but it's no Fura Fura~ and it will take some time for me to stop missing that ED. <br><br>I do like that they featured stalker-chan in it though.</br></br></br></br>   tfw jc staff are doing 2 other shows this season   <br>His goal has always been to beat his old man. On every front.</br>  <br>What if the punishment includes grandpa using HIS connections to get her temporarily blacklisted by her usual clients?</br>  <br>The loli master strikes again</br>  SOON  <br>First for EGAO</br>  Selena/serena is the best girl, she should have more fun.  Have you accepted best and most stylish girl into your heart?  <br>Soon what? The end of the boring Synchro Arc?<br><br><br><br>She should also be more developed as a character.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Kotori <br><br>My sides. Inb4 "Kotori sucks/is worst girl" replies.</br></br></br>  Reira is SEXY!  <br>i bet the Fusion is going to attack during the tournament or after MC beats jack during the closing event show.</br>  <br>I really have not liked Synchro that much. I was really hype at first too.</br>  <br>Shit taste detected.<br><br>Reira sucks as a cute character AND as a creepy one.<br><br>You should feel ashamed of your post.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i cant read moon runes.<br><br>Kotori is shit though.</br></br></br>  <br>remember those days when people didnt know if Sora was a boy or a girl,then they found out but still posted cute pictures of him., then stuff happen an no more cute pictures.</br>  <br>Sora is still best shota.</br>  never forget  <br>"Kotori is shit though" - The regular tsundere /a/ Yugioh regular.<br><br>I know most of you fap to her anways.</br></br></br>  <br>Translation when.<br><br><br>Damn my sucky grammar.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I know most of you fap to her anways. <br>Only the pictures where she's pregnant.</br></br>  <br>RURI fucking when?</br>  Man, I started watching Zexal but it's just too lackluster. I'm using an episode guide to see what the important episodes are and I have made it to episode 40 in just 3 or so hours. Does Yuma stop being a dumbfuck?  <br>She is the best Yugioh girl to fap to, objectively</br>  <br>Nope, he turns into a super saiyan but he's still annoying</br>  <br>Yes i do...she cute and all but its annoying in the anime all she says is "yuma" "YUMAAA" thats it.</br>  <br>Both are great.</br>  <br>Zexal might get pretty good with Zexal II but Yuma stays crap.</br>    <br>Even in the duel against this guy?<br><br>Reminder he was cheated to heck and back by the fourth "too OP pls nerf" deck in the entire Franchise and he was dueling by himself with no power ups and still won. Best duel.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>People are overthinking things, as usual. Last duel was just Jack being Jack, he likes to trash and humiliate his opponents and he thinks and acts like he is the top dog and he does to let you know it.<br>In 5Ds he did the same, but Yusei was stoic/autistic enough to not take the bait and focused in the important things. Yuya is not Yusei and Yuya is a lot more emotional about things like that, so he took what Jack said too personal.</br></br></br></br>  <br>what do you expect? He's 14.</br>  <br>Can't handle the bantz of AUSTRALIA JACK</br>  <br>Yugi was also 15 and didn't bitch and moan when shit happened either, at least not on Yuya and Yuma's levels. <br><br>Also going back to the convo earlier, a variety of formats would fix the TCG up pretty nicely combined with multiple banlists for each format, but that's too much work for KoJ/A, just make more broken Xyz and call it a day.</br></br></br>  <br> Yugi was also 15 and didn't bitch and moan when shit happened either, at least not on Yuya and Yuma's levels. <br><br>People act different? Shocker,anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Naaah, Zexal is KR Double and KR Gaim (before Kouta made it cool) .<br><br> Fusion required to henshin <br><br> Zexal I = Base Form <br><br> Zexal II = Kachidoki <br><br> Zexal III = Kiwami and   Overlord powers <br><br> Zexal Weapons = Arms for Utopia (One is even literally called "Arms") </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuya is a bit much though, I like him, but they do need to dial it back a tad.</br>  <br> You talk too much. </br>  <br>Yugi isn't as stressed out as Yuya is right now, as far as I can remember.</br>  <br>I know Yu-Gi-Oh is known for crazy shit<br><br>But this? This is just silly.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw this comic will never be translated. </br>  <br>Yugi had his grandfather hospitalized and then carded within like the first 2 episodes.</br>  <br>Zexal 1 is mostly garbage, but 2 is somewhat better and it has some really good duels towards the end.</br>  Cutest and strongest  <br> has some really good duels towards the end. <br>you mean that bullshit where Yuma literally pulls a fucking card out of his ass.</br></br>  <br>Masumi supposedly is quite beautiful and fashionable. Is she a metaphor for tan girls being considered hot in Japan?</br>  <br> strongest <br><br>I wasn't even at my strongest.</br></br></br>  <br>i want to see the tomato cry.</br>  <br>He had a way to get him back and a spirit who won all his duels for him. He also got to talk to his grandpa though the camera he was trapped in, in the manga version.</br>  <br>i dont know, but tan girls are the best girls.</br>  so why does everyone always say Zexal is shit? I've never seen anyone elaborate on this point. I'm on episode 130 and Zexal II is an improvement over the first season but I don't think it was bad <br><br>Most of the filler was alright although there were some bad episodes (like that short guy in the Heartland tournament) and the show has a lot of good points (some good characters, atmosphere, setting, music etc) <br><br>I don't necessarily disagree with the statement that it's the worst YGO series, there have been a fair amount of times while watching where I felt it wasn't nearly as engaging as 5D's which I also recently watched. Overall the duels aren't that good or memorable at all, I can't even remember how Yuma won duels that were only 10 episodes ago, but I still think the hate is exaggerated<br><br>I'd legitimately appreciate some discussion as I don't really have a problem with being proven wrong, I just can't put my finger on what is dissatisfying to me personally about the show. Also I really like some aspects of it which makes me want to say it's legitimately good but even that feels like a stretch<br><br>the IV vs. Shark duel was good, but it had some pretty shitty moments</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but what does Yuya have to bitch about? He knew Yuzu was likely safe with Yugo, didn't give a crap about any of the rest of his friends, and then gets highly upset when Jack tells him his dueling isn't fun and that his is better, which to the people of Synchro, it is.</br>   <br>I'm mostly talking about the last Kaito duel and the last 2 Vector duels.</br>  <br>I'm with you on that. Zexal is Shin Yugioh Tensei.</br>  <br>Zexal II is fine, Zexal I is the train-wreck where Yuma is a bigger dumbass than Judai (who forgot the rules half the time) and manages to constantly lose and act like a fucking tard.</br>  <br>I enjoyed Zexal, but some parts of the plot annoyed me. Like Kaito's dad being the one who created Heartland, and the reveal with Yuma towards the end. I won't go into that though. <br><br>Anyway, I don't know where Zexal stands on my list, but Arc-V is legitimately one of my least favorite Yu-Gi-Oh! series. And I know /a/ will try to call me out on having shit taste, but I don't really give a fuck because half of the people in Arc-V threads aren't even real Yu-Gi-Oh! fans, but parrots who got into it specifically because of Arc-V. And you'd be hard pressed to tell someone their entry series is bad. <br><br>So far, I feel like Arc-V is just a big disappointment. That may because it's such a fucking broad series. But I'm hoping the manga is better since they usually are. I'm also hoping some side-stories come from it, it's got a setting that looks like it'd be generous to such.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>my dislike of the show is the MC he shows no growth and he acts like a fool and ignores help until he's getting shit on, overall i hate his personality</br>  <br>To be fair to Yuuya other must be difficult for him to do his Circus Ringleader act while riding a motorcycle at high speed. The atmosphere is just not the same</br>  <br>I only have digital devil saga which I recently got on psn and haven't played much of <br><br>do people hate the SMT games or something?</br></br></br>  <br>If you want to be a true entertainer you have to manage different styles. Yusho would have agreed.</br>  <br> Didn't give a crap about any of the rest of his friends. <br>I wish /a/ didn't exaggerate.</br></br>  <br>Was Yuya even really trying to be entertaining that Duel. It didn't feel like it, it sort of just felt like he was trying to blow Jack the fuck out.</br>  <br>Crow had to literal tell him to think about the rest of his friends. Reiji had to literal tell him to think about everyone else and not just Yuzu entirely. <br><br>It's not an exaggeration when we have characters straight up telling it to his face.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean that it's an Order Versus Chaos story.<br><br>Eliphas is *very* similar to YHVH, and while Dong is not similar to Lucifer, the origins of the Barians as castways of the Astral World are similar to the forces of Chaos.</br></br></br>  <br> Yeah but what does Yuya have to bitch about <br>The interdimensional war going on.</br></br>  <br>It was Yuuya's first time and he went against the very best. I think he did it decent all things considered.</br>  <br>Didn't seem like it, more like he got upset that Jack said his dueling was more entertaining and he got upset and even more so when Jack told him his entertainment sucked.</br>  I want the zexal fags to leave. they are like dm fags but even dm fags like a show thats objectively decent/good. Zexal is just retarded.  <br><br><br><br>Because they continue in resetting Yuya's character. He was okay after the qualification of the tournament, he was focused in being the best duelist around like his dad, then they added more drama with the death of Yuto and the soul that was trapped within him, thus destabilizing his personality.<br>Then he was okay after his duel with Reiji, he was focused in rescue Yuzu, Sora, uncard all the people, and defeat Academia; but no Yuya, you must EGAO no matter what, not even in a fucking war. And so we are here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aren't all duelists warriors though?</br>  <br>well at first Yuma didn't listen to Astral at all and then he started relying on him hardcore, now he's had a duel without him and also not that it counts for much but after a while he learned how to play even though he was dueling with Astral. He'd take Astral's advice (or ignore it) once in a while but overall he learned the combos and how his monsters worked<br><br><br>yeah Yuma is a dumbass but for the most part it got better even in Zexal I, I don't think it's much of a problem that he loses though. He lost more than other protags but in the grand scheme of the show it wasn't much <br><br>How is it a train wreck apart from Yuma?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Crow had to literally tell him to think about the rest of his friends. <br>They're all competent people though, otherwise they wouldn't be Lancers.<br><br> Reiji <br>Reiji doesn't give a fuck about anyone. This is blatant hypocrisy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Zexal had a better planned story and was more entertaining. At least a better planned story than 5Ds (an extreme trainwreck, to put it mildly).<br><br>And it's not as pretentious. The very second I heard the word "prison" was the time I knew 5Ds was trying to be a seinen show when it's shonen and it's badly executed at that (FMA is also like that but plays it better).<br><br>And now Arc-V is following that shitty format. <br>We really need to leave the Synchro Dimension ASAP.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuma grows the most out of any character bar Shark and maybe Kaito. Just because his strategy remains the same, doesn't mean he doesn't grow as a character.</br>  <br>I think my reading comprehension is shit<br><br>Did you say Judai forgot the rules sometimes? Because if so that isn't true.</br></br></br>  <br>I've been watching YGO since DM first aired in the US, Arc-V is pretty fun, but to each their own.<br><br>Yuma has lost leagues more than the other protagonists, he lost like 25-30 times, he lost quite a lot. As for other problems, most of it is just Yuma, that's it. He's just an awful protagonist, outside of that the series got a bit much, most of the time it was just about magic and the rare super thing like Judai doing Prince of Persia shit in Venice or say Yusei shoryuken or Shun/Sora in Arc-V, but they went full on space saiyan and pulling magic cards out of their asses. Like cards have been pulled out the ass before like Yuya's pendulums, but they were literally drawing the cards, showing them, and then changing them in Zexal, on top of the ending sucking shit in Zexal. <br><br>Zexal isn't terrible, Yuma is just terrible and everything that typical involves his character in any way, but yes, he is less annoying in II outside of the end.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I appreciate that you're the most enlightened individual on /a/, and I wish to learn more of your secrets. How may I get in contact with you so I may finally have as an exquisite and refined taste you have for all things animated?<br><br>I'm not being sarcastic, by the way.</br></br></br>  <br>I think he cares about Reira. Maybe. Probably.</br>  <br>Okay, what is wrong with Arc-V? Like you just did what a lot of anons do by saying you hate the series but you don't say why.</br>  <br>1st generation (DM) oldfag here. So far I'm enjoying Arc-V, it's true it have some lousy parts (Yuuya's qualification filler arc was boring at points) but the parts that are good are really good so it keeps me motivated enough to keep watching, also like you said there's lots of interesting stuff happening on the sidelines that I hope gets some attention. I guess what I like about Arc-V is that so far it seems to be heading up to play with several concepts of the show in new ways so it was refreshing. <br><br>Haven't seen ZeXal in detail, I saw like 3 episodes then decided to skip it entirely (I retired from dueling as well, just recently like 6 months ago I started to return to the game).<br><br>I've been nostalgic recently and I'm watching DM again (this time in Japanese). Time will tell if o get convinced to give Zexal a second chance.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How?</br>  <br>Doujin when?<br>Duel when?</br></br>  <br> They're all competent people though, otherwise they wouldn't be Lancers. <br>Sawatari is not competent, don't you lie. <br> Reiji doesn't give a fuck about anyone.  <br>He cares about Reira, Serena, and his Ninja. <br><br>Poor wording on my part, but I remember him forgetting that the holograms weren't real when dueling sometimes, especially an under-water sequence or not knowing shit all outside of his cards. Judai was fucking dumb, but Yuma was more dumb somehow.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Never.<br> Never. </br></br>  <br> 1st generation (DM) oldfag here <br>Seeing DM first isnt being an oldfag, its the norm. The only people that'd qualify as oldfags is reading the manga before the show</br></br>  <br> but I remember him forgetting that the holograms weren't real when dueling sometimes, especially an under-water sequence <br>You mean during the Seven Stars where that happened literally once and it wasn't that Judai forgot that holograms weren't real but it was that the guy dueling him didn't finish his sentences and fooled everybody into thinking he was having a Dark/Shadow Duel<br><br> not knowing shit all outside of his cards <br>What?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm an oldfag and I agree with . In fact, Arc V was the one that got me back into the series after I dropped it midway through the 5D's WRGP since it was just getting dull. I tried ZeXal, but the duels were such a pain to watch and there were a lot of concepts I found ridiculous that I couldn't really get into it even though the Barian subplot caught my interest a bit.</br>  <br>Judai didn't know what the word fiancee meant.</br>  <br> he lost like 25-30 times  <br> counting an offhand comment about how many duels he lost in the beginning of the show that weren't even shown  <br><br>I agree about the space saiyan stuff though, I wouldn't mind it at all if they didn't pull such retarded shit out of their asses. Other protagonists had destiny draws but it was just completely over the top with Zexal. It's one thing if you use magic powers to draw a card that lets you summon your ace monster at the end of a duel but Zexal really made it into a gimmick. Barians Chaos Draw and all that. And Yuma just drew random new Zexal weapons with retarded effects. I don't see why they couldn't just give Yuma better new aces to summon with Shining Draw instead of bullshit equip cards etc, would've felt less cheap but they needed to throw on extra effects because he'd always already have his shitty ace out<br><br>Also a huge portion of the monsters all have the same effects. Overall the show also just feels like it's more focused on summoning monsters than other series, like that's almost all there is to it</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a shonen trope, anon. Goku didn't know what it meant when Chichi said they would get married.</br>  <br>How is this different from any other show?</br>  <br> MC is oblivious to love <br><br>Literally every shonen ever what the fuck</br></br></br>  <br>Two words: Executive. Meddling.<br><br>You know, the one that ruined the Dark Signers Arc? (Damn Carly VA). Or the one that made the show more larger than it should have been?<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I like Bruno, Yliaster, Aporia and Z-one (especially Bruno-chan) but their arc was very forgetteable because it was not meant to happen.<br><br>Zexal in the other was more planned, as in, a little more than 5ds and GX. It was also very childish to compensate for 5Ds pretentious pseudo-seinen plot bored the japanese kids watching the show found boring. I'm so sorry for the people who don't want to admit they are watching a children's show.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think anyone thinks 5D's isn't a childrens show <br><br>Just because a lot of people say it's the best doesn't mean they think it's ultra mature, you'd have to be retarded to think 5D's is anything other than a kids show</br></br></br>  <br>Pls no.</br>  <br>I really hate my grammar.<br><br><br>Yugioh in general are a children's shows. 5Ds is just pretentious faggotry.</br></br></br></br>  Konami here, we have introduced a new summoning method called Pendulum, but we'll make sure that it still will be under-represented as a whole throughout the meta, and that Nekroz will still continue to dominate everything despite our recent bans of Djinn. Thanks to this it allows us to notice that nobody is buying new cards because nothing can top Nekroz, so when the next exciting anime comes out after Arc-V, you can bet we'll have a new exciting super summon method that will make even Nekroz look like Synchros! In the mean time though we have created some exciting new Xyz for you all to try out in your favorite Top 3 decks!

I'm pretty sure if Arc-V delivers on its potential it could beat DM for me</br></br></br>  <br>Nah <br>DM &gt;5DS = Arc V &gt; GX &gt; Zexal <br>DM is the beginning and the GOAT. Nobody forgets it, it has the best dub because Dan Green and Eric Stuart. The game was simple and the plot flowed well. Had the best conclusion. <br>5ds is second best. Dub is mediocre. Yusei is the manliest protagonist, actually beat people up and was part of a street gang. He became a scientist in the end and his friends became great people in society. <br>Arc V is going good so far. <br>GX had the most chill protagonist. Jaden never studied and did well. Main problem is that character development is poor and feels shoehorned. <br>Zexal was all over the place and not consistent. First it was collect all 99 numbers.

Now I just wish to have Thousand Eye-Restrict again legal. Or give me back Stratos. Or I'll just quit the game and just stick with anime.

I take anything, even dragons, just give me fodder tomy folder.</br>  <br> Virtual world good in any way, shape, or form <br>Doma may have a few decent parts but virtual world is absolute gutter trash.</br></br>  <br>I like attempts of switching up the format/rules, but DeckMaster was not that interesting in the end (though Dark Paladin/Mirage Knight was nice).<br>And actual story of the arc was complete trash</br></br>  <br> but DeckMaster was not that interesting in the end <br>I wished they'd released an IRL version of the rules. Its the same thing as Speed Spells, why does the anime keep shilling alternate game modes then never bothering to make them?</br></br>  <br>The DS games at least allowed you to mess with that(Malefic/Earthbound decks are fun with Speed World)</br>  <br>Dungeon Dice Monsters isn't filler.<br><br>I love you forgot KC Grand Prix, the actual filler arc. That's how bad it is<br><br>Also, Virtual World is so unbelievably bad</br></br></br></br></br>  What do people not like about Virtual World?<br>The story wasn't amazing but I thought it was fairly compelling to an extent and a lot of cool moments.</br>  <br> I love you forgot KC Grand Prix, the actual filler arc. That's how bad it is <br><br>Grand Championship was aight. There were some interesting duels and some lousy ones. But fuck if I didn't love Kaiba reking Ziegfried with Chaos Emperor Dragon.<br><br>Leon v Yugi was pretty good to with the castle of Stromberg hack card.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but I thought it was fairly compelling <br>At what point is it compelling?<br><br>And people don't like it because it completely interupts an already interesting arc with some bullshit that nobody cares about and a game concept that does not work</br></br></br></br>  So, Yuya comes and say he feels weird when he is with Yuzu, he feels hot and want to see something else from her, and Yuzu feels the same. What do you do?<br> explain <br> give them a video so they can watch it <br> just fuck already (if they don't know then just teach them   and if you can join them )</br></br></br>  <br> only one guy <br>It doesn't feel right looking at this picture knowing either Yusei or Judai are getting cucked</br></br>  <br> That's so cute, you'll understand when you get older and above your current age of 14 </br>  <br> wasting a chance of a lifetime <br>for shame</br></br>  <br>I exclusively live to see other people being happy anon</br>  <br> not sure if moralfag or autistic <br>you could at least film them</br></br>  <br>Unless the guy is Johan, I doubt Judai would give a fuck</br>  <br>The whole Kaiba family drama was interesting to me. I like how Noah stole Mokuba which forced Kaiba to think about what was really important to him, especially considering how rude and selfish he was in the BC finals on the blimp. Things got even more intense when Kaiba lost to Noah and Yugi took over from there. That was my favorite part of the duel, especially that magician trio blast. Gozaburo v Kaiba was also really poetic because it showed him using Exodia against Kaiba, and Exodia has always been a sore spot for Kaiba. It was the very same monster he first lost to against Yugi in episode 1. From a thematic sense, it also shows him overcoming his past and getting stronger (succeeding the man who adopted him). Just all of the Kaiba family drama and his past was interesting to me really. I still remember the "51 is the magic number" speech he told Mokuba about how 51 is the majority number and how if you have that much no one can have more than you. It's kinda dumb but it's simple and powerful.<br><br>I also felt sad when Honda sacrificed himself to save Serenity in the 3v1 against Nesbit. That was the first time we saw him duel and I honestly thought they were going to get away with the victory but one of them got hit so it took me by surprise.</br></br></br>  <br> Judai <br>Hah</br></br>  <br> That choker on Aki <br>Muh dick</br></br>  <br>Neither, just weirdly depressed<br><br>If it's Judai at the end of GX, I'm pretty sure he just doesn't give a shit about anything at that point</br></br></br>  <br> Judai <br> Yusei <br> Giving a fuck about something other than card games <br>KEK<br>E<br>K</br></br></br></br></br></br>  When will we learn about the secret tribute dimension that is the true real evil?  <br>True March of the Monarchs starts on episode 119.<br>Leo reveals that he planned to fuse the 4 dimensions to create a singular dimension with the top duelists surviving the ordeals to stand against the Multiverse conquerors.<br>Dennis is still somehow a double agent, Yuya goes Super Egao 3, Jack Punches Yuma and Yugo mistakes Serena for Rin and hugs her, leading to broken ribs.<br>Shun becomes a neet playing with Ruri dolls</br></br></br></br>  <br> Mr. Takahashi also brought along storyboards which he shared with the audience, but by far most exciting thing shown at the panel was a teaser trailer for the new movie, which we will debut online 7/18. <br><br>Tomorrow on yugioh.com</br></br></br>  <br> only people that'd qualify as oldfags is reading the manga before the show <br>But there were no scans for the Yu-Gi-Oh manga in 2001 though. So only oldfags are those who have seen the 4kids dub beforehand and love the series enough to watch it subbed when it was finally avalible and to continue on watching with the following four series.</br></br>  <br>Naw, they just never explored the aftermath of Satellite and the City finally becoming connected though. They also never gave Aki a story arc of her integrating back into society after she sort of almost destroyed her school and injured classmates and staff when she lost control of her powers. Her Dad is a politician so, he may have pulled some strings.</br>  <br> So only oldfags are those who have seen the 4kids dub beforehand <br>That's fucking everyone though</br></br>  5Ds is pretty much the pinnacle of Yugioh, in spite of its flaws. It was pretty sufficiently great. The only one that measures up is the original and my favorite, personally, is probably GX. It's really good subbed and has a nice manga. <br><br>When Arc-V isn't thrilling its lifeless.<br>It keeps planning on making reveals, but it's taking way too long to do them. There's a bunch of shit nobody gives a fuck about in the way that bogs it down. <br><br>I don't think its pretentious, 5Ds, I don't think it tries too hard to be Seinen either. I think, what it was, was really good at maintaining a balanced level of hype. At least before the Second Half, and to be honest, even after some of the filler, it was still pretty legit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nice blog faggot</br>  <br>You mean GX. GX is the pinnacle of Yugioh.</br>  <br>where do I subscribe? do you have a tumblr page?</br>  <br>I'm 34 episodes into 5D's and I've lost almost all interest. The only redeeming aspects have been Jack, Carly, and a few of the riding duels. Yusei is far and away the least interesting MC and the whole Team Satisfaction is perhaps the gayest thing in the entire franchise.</br>  <br>Yes I have one, it's called <br> fakyomamma.com/juegagerman <br>:V:V:V<br> Btw I am not that anon but I am just messing around </br></br></br></br>  <br>The only thing that annoys me is that there isn't nearly enough info sharing between the main characters. Shun has asked Yuya about Yuto at least 3 times, and hasn't got a concrete answer except for Ghost Yuto telling him to trust Yuya.<br><br>Nobody except for Yuzu, Yuya and Yuto (and Gon?) know about Yuzu's bracelet and exactly when it triggers. Reiji knows that Yugo isn't a bad guy, whereas Yuya seems to be unsure. The list goes on and on and on.<br><br> Also there probably won't be a decent slice of life episode with the lancers until the main plot is resolved. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>GX didnt have enough Rei to be top tier</br>  <br><br> blogger <br> tumblr <br>reported.</br></br></br></br>  <br> This webpage is not available <br> ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED <br>You made me all excited for nothing.</br></br></br>  <br>reported for declaring reports.</br>  <br>Fuck off tumblrfag, read the rules<br/></br>  <br>Do you honestly believe that?!</br>  <br>Are you retarded or something?</br>  <br>re-read the previous posts and stop trying to fit in newfag.</br>  <br> 594▶ <br> File: jaden yuki polymerization.jpg (24 KB, 500x283) <br>  (You) <br> You mean GX.

He is so based.  <br>what a hottie</br>  <br>also reminder Asuka best girl</br>  <br>About time</br>    <br>Who is the obligatory pseudo loli in this show?</br>  <br>that would be worst girl</br>  <br>You'd think one the main characters would be one, but nope, no main characters fit that role.</br>  <br>Green Mayoi</br>  <br>The reason why I dropped this show was the lack of "worst girl"</br>  <br> You'll never hug Taki's neck <br>why live</br></br>    <br>Wait, here's a better image.<br>She's in the horn, next to the fattie.</br></br>  Behold the mating dance of the eupho  <br>I want to comfort her and tell her everything will be ok.</br>  puff  <br>I didn't like any of them. But I suppose that one where Asuka tells that one girl to stop being a whiny cunt was okay.</br>  <br><br>He already did. This would make it the 2nd time.</br></br>  <br> Maude? </br>  <br>This</br>  <br><br>That early episode where the glasses euphonium leader whore makes the kissy face on the glass window of the door at the tuba girl.<br><br>You know the one.<br><br> Also I want to fugg the euphonium leader glasses girl. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  FEET  How many children?  <br>1/2</br>  <br>Enough to fill a symphony</br>  <br><br>First thing that came to mind after I saw this</br></br>  <br>The episode where Kumiko was walking everywhere in bare feet, and flexing them and rubbing them together.</br>  <br><br>Just imagine Taki-sensei depleted of energy and Reina poures a redbull on his mouth while she continues to grind him.</br></br>  Thread reminder that the Eupho trio are the best girls.    <br>damn</br>  <br>Is this even feasible</br>  <br>Dude that will kill him. Pouring any substance without stopping can cause someone to choke.</br>  At this point and time I think Reina's first time with Taki wouldn't even hurt. She's just so into him she'd probably cum right away.<br>That's the power of love, baby.</br>  <br><br>Good, let him die. Nothing should get in the way of KumikoxReina</br></br>  <br>Honestly, Asuka/Kumiko have a better chance at getting together than Reina/Kumiko. let it go.</br>  <br> Asuka/Kumiko <br>this does things to me man.</br></br>  <br><br> n-not yet Taki-sensei, we still need an entire section to play the trombone! </br></br>  What is this? K-On for the classy fedora crowd?<br><br> I can fap to this... </br></br>  <br><br>I know anon, but they're just too good together, I'll never be able to let it go.</br></br>  <br><br>I think 25 is Okamoto Raimu. She said her initials were R.O., not L.O. Her friends probably call her "Lime."</br></br>  <br>   ... </br>  <br>Reina will have 100 babies</br>  <br><br>I'm okay with this.</br></br>  I'd honestly support Reina and Taki if he wasn't so fucking old. No matter how you look at it, it's just wrong.  <br>The two can talk about Eupho all the time and even listen to Shidou-san together. Kumiko can also lean on Auska's shoulder and listen to her play Sound! Euphonium. <br><br>They would be so cute together, even as friends.</br></br></br>  "I love you too, Shuuichi-kun"  Still best girls.    <br>Lusting after Taki. Does that make Taki best boy?</br>  <br><br>i cri</br></br>  proof that timetravel can be fun  <br>everyone wants a piece of him</br>  <br>super cute</br>  <br><br>Fuck you, Kyoani will never animate that part anyway.</br></br>  <br><br>You mean the Oboe and OP girls?</br></br>  <br>Asuka will steal Kumiko just like all the others girls. This girl is afterall the true Harem Lord.</br>  <br>I hope so.<br><br>I will unfortunately have to live my dreams vicariously through kumiko if that's the case.<br><br>As a guy I'd like to fugg asuka but I probably don't have a chance since she's obviously a domineering les.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She'll never have Reina though, so the Harem will remain uncomplete forever</br>  <br>Asuka is totally fine with that. I don't think her and Reina would get along.</br>  <br>Reina doesn't have any friends other than Kumiko?</br>  <br>Ah, hence the hepburn romanization mention. Thank you, I'll add that to my list.</br>  <br><br>Yuuko and maybe Mizore.</br></br>  <br>sad</br>  <br>Mizore really? Reina doesn't seem to like her since she comes even earlier to practice in the morning, and Yuuko is just grateful and friendly.</br>  <br><br>That's plenty compared to before.</br></br>  <br>she doesn't make any efforts to have more friends?</br>  <br>why belarus?</br>  <br>I wouldn't call them her friends though. Yuuko seems to tolerate her. She's still pretty upset that Reina had the solos until the end of volume 3, when she realized that Reina was the best choice and was grateful for her. Mizore though hangs out most of the time with Yuuko or Nozomi and Natsuki. I don't think these two have ever talked or have they? I need novelanon.</br>  <br>I mean best girls</br>  <br>Reina in all three novels only cares about being special and Taki. Seriously that is her whole character. She doesn't care about making friends. Kumiko was just an exception cause of her terrible personality.</br>  <br><br>Because she's autistic.</br></br>  <br>I thought being special and Taki were tied.</br>  I thought Shoe is similar to Taki, why does Reina hate him?  KyoAni after K-ON<br><br>Nichijou &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the others (including this shit)<br><br>KyoAni IS DEAD</br></br></br></br>    <br>The episode where they play 愛を見つけた場所 at the hilltop</br>  <br>Don't have a particular favorite episode, but any episode with significant Hazuki screentime is a plus for me.  Too bad there weren't many of them ;_; </br>  Why is Kumiko so cute? Like I can't think of any specific mannerism or action by her that you can go "that's what's cute about her", but for some reason she just is.  <br>Cause he's hopeless and a coward.</br>    Why does Reina want to be so special? I don't get it, something must've made her want to become special. Is it her dad? she wants to become better?  <br>Who is more talented of the 2?</br>   H-Help! I need to help this Kumiko! What do I do, anon?!   <br>Missionary position.</br>  <br>it's just one of them who plays a fucking weapon anon</br>  <br>Mizore, she's right after Asuka. The Oboe is one of the most difficult instruments to play, and this girl can play it flawlessly when she's stable.</br>    <br>How does this even work.</br>  <br> faggot <br>every time</br></br>  <br>carry her you dumbfuck</br>  <br> wh-what do you mean?! </br>  <br>Maybe you should try liking better characters who had actual development and weren't completely flat and irrelevant</br>  <br> Roleplaying, seriously? </br>  <br>Best hair and melancholy demeanor.<br><br>The chillest anime girl.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Shuichi is physically weak hence the reason why he's stuck with band.</br></br>  <br> Chilliest? <br><br>Girl freaks out 24/7.</br></br></br>  <br>Her demeanor kinda reminds me of the Jinrui MC.</br>  <br>And it turns me on.</br>  <br>Female version of the best MC of all time.</br>  <br>On your back, het. Can't you even think on your own?!</br>  <br> I selfinserted so hard on Kyon so it makes him the best ever </br>  <br> Like this? </br>  <br><br><br><br>This is just pathetic. Come on anon, you can live life better than this.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I want a backstory of loli Kumiko.</br></br>  <br> Whats up with Asuka's BIG FUCKING EYES </br>  Anything for Taki-sensei.  <br>Reminder that more smug on the BDs</br>  <br>Anything?</br>  <br> Shinobu <br>Even her name sounds like she lifts.</br></br>  <br>NO you idiot, you need t carry her.</br>  <br>Are you seriously responding to yourself?</br>  <br> ri-right, let's see if things work out.

Yeah I have.</br>  My favorite episode was Episode 8. It was an exceptional piece of anime in general. I thought it outdid the Bakemonogatari episode where Crab and Araragi went on a date.  <br>Bestsuki &gt; Kaori &gt;&gt; Kumiko = Buchou &gt; Midori &gt; Oboe-chan &gt; Hazuki &gt;&gt; Reina &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shit &gt;&gt; Aoi &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ribbon</br>  <br> Reina that low <br>what the fuck is your problem?</br></br>  <br>I like this girl.</br>   DMJii is usefull and willing to help everyone <br> Kirika gets a cool henshin scene <br> Hibiki becomes more useless than Maria and stupider than she was in the first 2 seasons <br>What the fuck is happening?<br><br>At this rate, shit's getting so crazy that I expect Genjuro to borrow her Gungnir and transform into fucking Odin while solo'ing all the dolls at once.</br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that this cloth is see-thru      Oh my god  What was she thinking here?  <br><br>When did she become so sexual?</br></br>  <br>Can we hope for a proper edit of this scene in the BD then?</br>  Also, naked Chris  <br> Leg's crossed while transforming <br>Those were Dante levels of style.<br><br><br> What was she thinking here? <br>"Oh wow, she really is flat enough to be a sword."</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Kirika was too attractive this episode, I felt dirty.</br>      <br>Probably that she wanted to see her naked in a more intimate setting, but this will have to do.</br>    <br><br>FEET!</br></br>     corpses everywhere <br><br> Suddenly cooking with side characters <br><br>Okay</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kirika went from shit to top tier in one fucking episode <br>Cute, sexy, feet, useful, no whining, saves best girl, DESS DESS DESS.

When did she becomes so lewd?  <br>Probably another Miku episode.</br>  <br><br>Miku gets  kissed  by blue doll girl in front of her</br></br>  <br> stupider than she was in the first 2 seasons <br>To be fair, she's just consistent. She got through G without her ideals being changed. She didn't defend herself when Shirabe attacked her, she even absorbed DMJii's superb song so they won't get hurt. In the end, FIS got converted to the good guys. Now that she's fighting psychos that refuse to be reasoned with, trying to talk it out doesn't help.</br></br>  Is Carol ever going to be a threatening villain?  <br>I want her to fuck me in the ass</br>  <br>SU TO RO GA NO FU</br>  <br>I think Carol and Elfnein have raised more death flags than anybody you listed. Not including the dolls.</br>  <br>Garie's more threatening than her and gives off a more final boss vibe than her boss.</br>  <br> and become the edge <br>I'd prefer if she nutted up, grabbed Airgetlam and became a not-hero.</br></br>  WELP  <br/>  Garie is best doll.  <br> Miku giving no fucks </br>  <br>That Tsubasa's parents were horrible blacksmiths because they obviously over-folded her chest area</br>  <br> Now that she's fighting psychos that refuse to be reasoned with, trying to talk it out doesn't help. <br> Don't want people to get hurt <br> Find a bunch of dead people <br> They were killed by a doll <br> "I want to protect people" <br> A group of girls standing behind her who will die if she doesn't do something <br> Opponent literally is not human <br> Opponent is literally a doll made to kill humans <br> Still waivers <br>She's fucking stupid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>AIJOU YUUJOU</br>  <br>She tries to fight, she can't.

She can't spend half of the show without fighting, so either it's not a Miku episode or they're bringing Miku in earlier.</br>  <br> Find a bunch of dead people <br> They were killed by a doll <br> Are you Carol-chan's comrade? </br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Nanoha pulled this shit too<br> reveals Faito's super-dark family situation <br> "mom" reveals that she's a clone and that she hates her <br> MAKE A LITTLE WISH </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> When did she become so sexual? <br>She was always sexual.</br></br></br></br>  <br>[chuuni sound effects intensify]</br>  <br>She wavered at first, that's why it rejected her. Wavering even for a second in that situation was wrong on so many levels.<br><br><br>There's no way that when they all met and discussed things Tsubasa and Chris didn't tell everyone they're fighting inhuman doll killing machines.</br></br></br></br>   refreshing Pixiv every 5 minutes <br>Japan pls hurry</br>  <br>Who would be the best to tell her "Get in the gear Bikki"</br>  <br>They had an explicit, albeit brief, conversation about sex in the submarine. It's precisely because she's usually so dense that she was so affected by it. She's dense, but she knows boys have wee wees.</br>  <br> All the very fast detailed 1-frame shots in this show are getting way too ero. <br>They are quite delicious.</br></br>  <br> being shocked about corpses in a world where noise used to kill thousands of people on a regular basis </br>  <br/>  <br> Nanoha <br>No this fucking time you damned autist.</br></br>  <br>In both seasons, Hibiki only started to sing her second songs in Miku episode. Bringing Little Miracle in right now is too soon. If anything the second verse of G-beat is more suitable for this arc.</br>  <br>There is only one.</br>  <br>What exactly happened to make even Hibiki blush?</br>  <br>"I already see this every night.."</br>  <br>Maria, obviously.</br>  <br>"Nice."</br>  <br>Hibiki thinking about how Elf9 doesn't have anything between "her" legs.<br><br>Miku talking about something else says something like "I don't really care what they have attached there."</br></br></br>  <br>She thought she heard something gay. Bikki's not so dense anymore, as it turns out.</br>  <br> get in the fucking gear <br>Suddenly Xenogears comes to mind. <br><br>Which reminds me of these girls. Some of them actually resemble their Symphogear counterpart. Specially blue.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying Hibiki will be useless for a whole season <br>Yea, no she she'll be in the mope for 2 episodes at best and be back to her usually fisting.</br></br>  <br>"Focus. Deep breaths. Wait until we get back to the hotel."</br>  <br/>  <br>So we have concluded that it can't be a Miku episode that makes her get in the robot?</br>  <br>I think she'll go through a berserk phase that's different from her usual kind fisting first and only clear her head near the end.</br>  I wish epilogue of GX was wedding of these two, with Chris being the one that catches bouquet<br><br>Also classmates trio becoming new bridge bunnies</br></br>  <br> Implying Hibiki will be useless for a whole season <br>But no one implied that. It was just annoying to see it three seasons in when even the useless characters have their shit together now.</br></br>  <br>What did I do?<br>Did I accidently invoke some kind of shitpost meme?</br></br>  <br>If she continues to be unable to use Gungnir she'll probably end up giving it to Maria, who's raring to fight.</br>  <br> footfag secondaries are going to shit up the threads even further once this CR releases it <br>Call me a faggot all you want, you know I'm right.</br></br>  <br> until I retired <br> retired <br>RIP bridge bunny guy.</br></br></br>  <br>Then daddy issues come into play and she goes berserk.</br>  <br>How the fuck can you be a secondary when there's next to no fan material and no popular adaptation?<br><br>At least use a word like "casuals" or "normies" you scrotum-mongling douchepalace.</br></br></br>  <br>Not unless she's gonna mope around (or go berserk) until the end of the second act.  I could see that happening. </br>  <br> She's dense, but she knows boys have wee wees. <br>I refuse to believe that any of the girls know what a wee wee is.<br><br>Except for Chris of course.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe they were just Americans.</br>  Is she the sexiest now?  <br> normies <br>Fuck off back to whichever shithole board you crawled out of.</br></br>  <br>I think they all know what that is, except for Tsubasa who is too autistic to know what the fuck reproduction is for.</br>    <br>I'm not endorsing the word, I'm just saying it's a better fit than "secondaries", which explicitly refers to people brought in through fanworks and modern adaptations of older works.</br>  <br>This one.</br>  <br>There's always the retards who pick up the third season without touching the first two. Expect a lot of that along with<br> I want to suck Shirane(?)'s toes in her green Zesshou suit <br>Once those footkikes latch onto this.</br></br></br>  I wasn't the only one who laughed here, right?  <br>She always has been</br>  <br> secondaries <br>I don't think you know what that word means.</br></br>    <br>CR ran the first season, it's not like their mouth-breathers are seeing the franchise for the first time.</br>  <br>I think I laughed at almost every scene especially when they showed Nana`s drawing.</br>  <br>Him being wrong doesn't make you less wrong. The fact that you even typed out that word instead of "normalfags" shows where you come from. Don't use that /r9k/ shit here.</br>  <br><br>Dead girls can't be sexiest</br></br>  <br>It's might not be a Miku episode but Miku will still have something to do with it.<br> In order to protect, even if I end up hurting something <br> I won't turn my eyes away from pain anymore <br> Unless I step forward with more resolve <br> I won't ve able to face the future properly </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How is it annoying when she hasn't had her convictions challenge until now. Every villain in the show until now was miss understood or lack the resolve, but now there is a opponent that doesn't care from the beginning.</br>  <br>I wasn't here for the livestream because I  had work.  How much was everyone shitting on that faggot who was kicking and screaming while insisting that her drawing had nothing to do with that noise?</br>  <br>Is she eating one of her own deep-fried fingers?</br>  <br>She's getting there. I find the FIS trio to be much sexier than the original three.</br>  <br>Kirika is not smart</br>  <br><br>She can't help herself<br><br>Her chicken fingers are just too delicious</br></br></br></br>  <br> How is it annoying when she hasn't had her convictions challenge until now. <br>Because it's not a matter of challenging her convictions. She put on the armor and fought Chris to at least try and stop her rampage, but now she won't fight an inhuman doll who's killing people. If she explicitly states "I want to protect people and not see them get hurt" then how the hell does it make sense to not fight something that is inhuman and running around killing innocent humans? That's a direct fucking contradiction of her own ideals. That's why it's annoying.</br></br>  <br>No, it was Funimation that streamed, and is still streaming, the first season.</br>   DESS suddenly best girl. <br><br>All is right with the world.</br></br>  <br>Funi ran the first season. And Maria and DMJii were introduced in the second, which still hasn't been picked up for licensing. Those mentally challenged toe suckers will just think they were introduced off-screen and act like the retards they are when someone tells them otherwise. They're footfags, after all.</br>  Can someone explain to me how the used goods edgelord tsundere character became the most popular girl?  <br>But anon, this time she actually tried to fight.<br>Gungnir's the one who's sulking now.</br></br>  <br>We've been over this anon</br>  <br>Why is the sword so cute?</br>  <br>You forget Gungnir screwed Hibiki over this time.</br>  <br>Vegeta syndrome.</br>  <br>Not him I actually like it. The circumstances in G had Bikki get around having to deal with her ideals and they're bringing it up this season specifically and showing the negative effects of having that type of ideal. I don't think it's really that bad since it sort of continues what happened in G to Maria. Both wanted to save people, both are/were in situations that forced them to do something contrary to what they believe in, both got paralyzed and unable to do what they must do. <br><br>Maria wanted to save people but didn't know how to hold hands so she failed and Bikki had to teach her that. Bikki on the other hand refuses to fight when it would hurt people which was something Maria had experienced indirectly (ally Ver killing those kids) and directly (blood on her hands versus those soldiers) already. I love the usual Hibiki but it's a growing phase for her and that's good.</br></br></br>  <br>Chris-chan is cute, no need to explain.<br>Or maybe Nana willed it or something.</br></br>  Elf9 bath scene when?  <br>Wow, the lyrics to G-Beat make much more sense now. G-Beat is suddenly even better.</br>  <br><br>Didn't that only happen because of Hibiki's internal contradiction? Gungnir dindu nuffin.</br></br>  When will drawfag come back to these threads  <br> you mean it's like a little sword between their legs? </br>  <br><br> screwed <br><br>Fuck that<br><br>Hibiki looked at piles of corpses and still didn't want to fight<br><br>Gungnir got tired of her bullshit and no one would ever blame it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She needs to eat more fish</br>  <br>G-Beat is so good. Literally the perfect Hibiki song.</br>  <br>This is probably what actually happened. Hibiki's broke brain can't connect with Gungnir anymore.</br>  <br>We don't know yet, it's not like Gungnir can talk to Hibiki. Something like that happened back in YuYuYu but it lasted for like 5 minutes  and led to an awesome fight .</br>   Get rid of Chris's "Bang." <br> Give us the elusive triple Dess <br>Why must there always be sacrifices?</br></br>  <br> そうしてあなたの戦うべき敵 <br> 違うよ！私は人助けがしたいんだ。戦いたくなんかない！ <br>Sorry sport. Hibiki being an idiot is what caused Gungnir to stop answering her call. This one's on her.<br><br><br>Nope. Watch the episode.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All of the songs for Symphogear have wonderful meanings in their lyrics, but this season they feel extra meaningful.<br> Glorious Break <br> Please give me strength for one last push  <br> Exterminate <br> I will sing for you <br> Re-Birth Day <br> Why did my precious tale ended so quickly? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> When I grow up I want to become useless ! </br>  <br>No, she wanted to fight but Gungnir didn't plus Hibiki does this every season every first encounter with a human opponent she wants to talk but fails then second round its fisting.</br>  <br>Anon I don't speak moon</br>  <br>Oy vey, this fine woman will be plentiful for the Chosen People of Feet. U.S. Superior footfags must tell Mr. Tarantino and Mr. Schneider about this. I can't wait to commission tickle and giantess art with her feet on dA.<br>Just one question, what's her name? Never watched the first two seasons, seemed like anti-feet goyim trash.</br></br>  <br>GUNGNIRだっと</br>  My god, how did Kirika become so good in all aspects so quickly?<br><br>If she keeps this up, she might just outdo Chris as my favourite.</br></br>  <br>Yes, the contradiction is completely acknowledged by the show and is the whole point of her conflict. I don't know why anon is so mad about it.</br>  <br>People got killed left and right in S1concert, people got blown up along with their car during Durandal transportation, etc. She didn't care then so she doesn't care now either, Hibiki gives no fuck about random dead people, if you're not alive then you might as well be a rock to her.</br>     Design Archive scans never <br>kill me</br>  Garie is going to kiss Miku right in front of Hibiki and all she'll be able to do is watch.  <br><br><br>Oh my God, he was right.</br></br></br>  <br>Her henshin scene was so lewd, in fact most of them have been. I can't wait to see Shirabe and Marias.</br>  <br><br>So what you're telling me is that Hibiki is an inhuman monster</br></br>  <br>Do you know what miracles are?<br><br><br> but it's a growing phase for her and that's good. <br>It's also implemented poorly giving the timing, what's she's been through and already seen and done, and given that it's being driven by stubbornness and blind idealism.<br><br><br> she wanted to fight <br>Objectively fucking wrong.<br><br><br> And so, I'm the opponent you should be fighting now. <br> That's wrong! I want to save people, I don't want to fight at all! <br><br>And then Garie says she has a way "to make a pain in the ass like you fight."<br><br>Hibiki didn't want to fight. Stop blaming Gungnir.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nana must be appeased somehow.</br>  At this point, it will definitely lead to Hibiki going berserk again. Why does she go berserk whenever some people, in some situation, just can't accept her ideals? Is that her only response, being rabid and rampaging, whenever someone hurts her feelings?  <br>  yfw Dáinsleif resonates and fuses with Gungnir temporary <br><br>Or we get the big "Fuck You" sword like Symphogazer again and Hibiki wields it since it's already in the opening.</br></br></br>  <br>I love Tsubasa's cute little butt.</br>  <br> If she keeps this up, she might just outdo Chris as my favourite. <br>Listen, Kirika got based as fuck pretty fast, but let's not say things we don't mean.</br></br>  <br>Most people this show don't care about the red shirts if you're not a important character your death is just there to show how evil someone is.</br>  <br>Even more in common.</br>  <br><br>What kind of sorry excuse for a farce is this supposed to be?</br></br>  <br><br>If Chris and Kirika fucked, who would be on top?</br></br>  <br>We've been calling Tsubasa autistic this whole time but it was actually Hibiki.</br>  <br>I know you're extremely aroused after today, Maria, but you need to calm down.</br>  <br>You can't save or protect dead people so why bother?</br>  <br>Shirabe.<br><br>Threesomes are always an option.</br></br></br>  <br>Her holding her hand out to the side at the beginning of the transformation makes it certain we'll get a properly coordinated couple transformation between her and Shirabe.<br><br>This thing will be so lewd, I'm not sure if I will be able to handle it  or if my dick can take it, for that matter. <br><br><br>I'm not saying she is better, Chris is still undisputed #1, I'm jsut saying that the potential is there. If we get another season or a movie with Kirika in it and she keeps up the pace like this throughout it all, then there'd be proper competition.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So if Miku's lifeless body was lying on the ground, Hibiki would just shrug and go on befriending, huh?</br></br>  <br>Has Hibiki ever wanted to fight? I'm pretty sure Seigi wo Shinjite was about how she didn't want to fight but would anyway so that she would be useful.<br>I don't think that Hibiki has realized yet that the dolls can't be reasoned with, she only saw Garie (and briefly at that) and she knows that she's connected to Carol, who Hibiki thinks can be reasoned with.<br><br>Hibiki's ideals have been fucked from the beginning of S1, this isn't anything new.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A shit.<br> Just like you. </br></br>  <br>She would probably just shut herself inside somewhere and waste away until she died.</br>  <br> this isn't anything new. <br> Willing to fight enemies to protect innocent people <br> Willing to fight Chris <br> Now not willing to fight a literal monster who's on a rampage killing people <br>Ok.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>S2 Ep4 and the heart attacks it caused.</br>  <br>Chris would be submissive to everyone you could possibly pair her with.</br>  <br> I'm jsut saying that the potential is there. <br>And I'm saying that's heresy.</br></br>  <br>Miku's not only the sunshine but also the future. If she's dead then it'll also be end of Hibiki's life.</br>  <br><br>Nah<br><br>Then she'd just go Berserker mode and never, ever stop<br><br><br><br>Carol</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This anon knows what's up.</br>  <br> Willing to fight Chris <br>She punched her one time and that's it. The rest are all talk.</br></br>  <br>You can call it a monster all you want but its different when your opponent is human looking. Its easy to kill abomination but a human is going to make you hesitant.</br>  <br>Carol created lewd as fuck dolls based on her own personality, she'd top Chris in a second.</br>  <br> inb4 Shirabe henshin scene highlighting her little, subtle, supple, perfect size chest <br><br>What about Maria's now that ass, tits, legs, boobs are covered?</br></br></br>  <br>We don't even know if the dolls are actually monsters though. And she clearly was willing to fight Garie seeing as how she tried to transform<br><br>In fact, when has Hibiki actually fought another human besides Chris? Even against Chris, Hibiki mostly just defended herself besides that one punch (her main goal was to lure Chris away from Miku and try to talk things out), and she didn't really attack Mikugeah much either.</br></br></br>  <br>Thinking about it, Maria cried for those nameless little kids and was in shock after seeing civilians get shot and after fighting those soldiers. It just hit me that being focused in getting the fight away from civilians first was actually consistent with her previous actions. Neat.</br>   animators fail at their job by not giving us Maria's pov   <br>I'm just looking at things from a rational standpoint, worrying that they could always do some retarded shit and somehow make Chris worse.<br><br>Then again, she's not my waifu, so unbreakable trust in her is not really there, which I'll use as my excuse for doubting her superiority.</br></br></br>   Chris literally becoming a naked burrito and being saved by sexy lolis <br><br>Remember when this was Chris?</br></br>  <br>Didn't she attack a US ship a episode later with no problem using the Noise?</br>  <br>Why would you need animators to give you POV of holding a sword?</br>  <br> She punched her one time and that's it. <br>She put her fucking armor and and engaged her in battle. That's more than she's done this season, and Chris is probably the most human character in the show.<br><br><br> but a human is going to make you hesitant. <br>Yup. Just look at all that hesitation.<br><br><br> We don't even know if the dolls are actually monsters though <br>What? Yes we do. Carol created them.<br><br> And she clearly was willing to fight Garie seeing as how she tried to transform <br>I know you can't understand moon, but she literally said she didn't want to fight, and Garie said that she was going to make her fight.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She she thought Miku was dead for like 10 minutes in G she pretty much just shut down and lost the will to live.</br>  <br>Because the Nanablade is much sexier.</br>  <br>She was really unhappy about it.</br>  <br>/r/ing a Tsubasa-sword Oblivion/Skyrim mod</br>  <br> hen again, she's not my waifu, so unbreakable trust in her is not really there <br>She's my waifu, and I trust her.<br><br><br>Chris was pissed that the kouhai she was supposed to protect ended up saving her. She's the same Chris, she just got cheap shotted by magic noise. I'd say she was doing pretty well up until that point.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was best Chris.</br>  <br>Semi-related.</br>  <br><br>That's just projecting what her daddy wanted<br><br>I guarantee you if you stole her hat, sat on her throne and used her as a footrest she'd be licking your feet clean and thanking you for the honor</br></br></br></br>  So did Maria comfort Tsubasa with her body during their last night in London to help her get over the loss of her gear?  <br>Then you are a lucky man and I hope that, for all of us Chris-fags, you'll be right with who you trust.</br>  Do we have any consensus on what this thing is yet?  <br>Carol apparently created Elf9 too and she seems nice enough. Plus Hibiki doesn't really know what Carol's motives and backstory are, and since she knows that Garie is connected to Carol she probably assumes that she might be able to reason with her. I don't think she would actually engage her unless Garie herself attacked Hibiki and co. <br><br>Also even if Hibiki didn't want to fight, she was obviously willing. The two are not mutually exclusive.</br></br></br>  <br>Cute.</br>  <br>I think Maria gets forced every night regardless of the situation anyway.<br><br>Homonculus.</br></br></br>  <br>the creature?</br>  <br>Chris had a fucking complete relic with defensive function, don't you see how fragile and cute that doll looks compare to her?</br>  If I go into this expecting even more ridiculous Genesis of Aquarion with little grills, will I be satisfied?  <br>Wasn't that after the soldier fight? Her mental state didn't look good with the blood on her weapon at that point. She's even more broken after.</br>  <br>I think we're not giving due importance to the two big shocks Hibiki received this season. The first being the things about fathers that Carol said, which clearly left her very disturbed, as was hinted earlier by her quickly avoiding the subject in the pool scene. The second is the fact that Tsubasa and Chris became basically useless as gears for the foreseeable future. She has a drastic change of mood when they tell her she's the only one left who is still able to fight.<br><br>What does this mean? Hibiki has always had an internal conflict because even though she doesn't want to fight, the only way to protect who she wants is by fighting. It doesn't matter that Garie is a doll because fighting Garie means indirectly fighting Carol, and she doesn't want that. Up until now, she has had considerable liberty to play the role of the "good cop" without worrying about the consequences of her actions because Chris and Tsubasa were around to keep things in order, but like Shirabe said, that's just hypocrisy. Now she's being forced to face the consequences of what she believed was right and she isn't able to deal with it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>My money's on trap</br></br>  <br> that half second when it looks like she was going in for a kiss </br>  <br>Doesn't matter.</br>  Why are are groups suddenly putting out epsiodes 1 and 2 now? <br>Did something change? New raws?</br>  <br> just taking the headset <br>Rude.</br></br>  <br><br>How would you even tell?</br></br>  <br> some groups <br>It's almost as if they have something in common that explains it all perfectly!</br></br>  <br>Crunchyroll released their subs, those are just rips<br><br>Next week they'll release 3&amp;4</br></br></br>  <br>Its a homunculus. They have no gender. But you know the rule. If it's cute...</br>  <br>Maria and Tsubasa are straight.</br>  <br> she was obviously willing. The two are not mutually exclusive. <br>Now you're trying to use semantics to move away from the point. She didn't want to fight, she wasn't willing to, but she was forced to. Garie literally said she was being a pain in the ass so she'd force Hibiki to fight. She also already fought Chris in season 1 with less resistance. The step backwards is the worst part.<br><br><br> don't you see how fragile and cute that doll looks compare to her? <br>You mean the one explicitly stated to be beyond superhuman strength and agility and to possibly be stronger than the Symphogear?<br><br><br>Neither of those things have to do with a monster that just killed a group of people attacking your friends.<br><br> Up until now, she has had considerable liberty to play the role of the "good cop" without worrying about the consequences of her actions because Chris and Tsubasa were around to keep things in order, but like Shirabe said, that's just hypocrisy. Now she's being forced to face the consequences of what she believed was right and she isn't able to deal with it. <br>You just used a whole lot of words to say nothing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tsubasa's crotch has a face.</br>  <br><br>Homunculi can't have dicks?</br></br>  <br>It was not suddenly, there was the commercial break between each part</br>  <br>Flat != straight.</br>  <br>Only one punch then it was girl talk while Chris beat the shit out of Hibiki.</br>  <br>Not this one. Elf9 is sexless.</br>  <br>No, dick majikks are too much for even the most advanced of alchemists. The D is born, not created.</br>  <br>Believe in Chris. Believe in miracles.</br>  <br>It's most likely a homunculus or a magical clone of loli magician.</br>  <br><br>So it only has two holes?</br></br>  <br>But you can still fuck it, right? It has a mouth and a butt.<br>It does have a butt, right?<br>At least it has a mouth.</br></br></br>  <br> Only one punch <br>And yet that's still leagues more than she's done this season. You're also saying "only one punch" like it was a little love tap and not a rocket-fueled pilebunker punch.</br></br>  <br>You're trying to understand the characters in Symphogear like a cohesive logical structure. That won't get you anywhere.</br>  <br>I hope they gave whoever designed Chris a promotion, because she is perfection.</br>  <br>It is a mystery.</br>  <br>It's a mystery to everyone.</br>  <br>So they could technically get away with showing her completely and absolutely naked and just leave the nips and any sexual organs away?<br><br>I mean, she canonically doesn't have anything there that could be offensive or sexual.</br></br></br>  <br>I, for one, am willing to take one for the team. And for science.</br>  <br><br>Four if it turns out to be a girl</br></br>  <br> Scan: Brainwashing <br>What kind of scanner can detect something like that?</br></br>  <br>Hibiki wasn't forced to fight, though. If she really wouldn't fight no matter what, she could've just gotten her friends to get the hell out of dodge. Garie herself hadn't attacked Hibiki yet so in Hibiki's mind she had no reason to go aggressive yet, and its been long established that Hibiki won't fight unless she feels that she has to. If an opponent looks human at all then she WILL try to talk to them, no ifs ands or buts about it.<br><br>And why shouldn't she? Every time that she's tried it, it's worked eventually. It worked with Chris, arguably with Fine, and with the FIS girls. She hasn't really had anything challenge her worldview besides Shirabe calling her a hypocrite.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm really sad that Maria lost those cute puffs of hair under her cat ears when se grew up.</br>  <br>Keep in mind that the other things Carol created kill you with their mouths. Godspeed anon.</br>  <br>Wait, does it not have a belly button? So it IS a homunculus.</br>  So, hopefully the Anon that insisted that the Noise Tsubasa fought on episode 2 and Nana's drawing looked nothing alike killed himself.  <br><br> four <br><br>wait what?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It does.<br/></br>  <br>OH GOD<br>THERE WERE SHARK TEETH<br>NOT JUST IN THE MOUTH<br>SEND HELP</br></br></br></br>   Jiiiiii~   <br>I hate steps backwards in characterization or character development for no reason.<br><br><br> Garie herself hadn't attacked Hibiki yet so in Hibiki's mind she had no reason to go aggressive yet, <br> Pile of dead bodies lying scattered <br>You can't use the "maybe she couldn't connect the dots" excuse when she's a seasoned battle pro. She's knows what's going on. This isn't idealism or complex, this is downright retardation.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You keep bring up the Chris fight but Hibiki ran away and then defend herself before give her one good punch then they talk and that was it. It wasn't a trade of blows like you try to make it out to be.</br>  <br>He gets to go to sleep every night knowing that he literally creates miracles. What better reward is there?</br>  <br>Science thanks you for your sacrifice</br>  <br>Boobs 2small</br>  <br> You mean the one explicitly stated to be beyond superhuman strength and agility and to possibly be stronger than the Symphogear? <br>They said that about Phara and Leiur but none of them ever see what Garie's capable of doing yet. <br>Hibiki only punched Chris after she accidentally endangered Miku, and she went to talking mode right after. She didn't want to hurt anyone for real, just some down time to talk. This time, everyone is telling her to fight to destroy, not to talk and obviously she can't do that.<br>It's not a step back, she's still in the same place as she was before. In order to fight this time, she needs to step forward and be willing to hurt something. That's when G-beat's 2nd verse happens.</br></br></br></br>  <br> the Chris fight <br> fight <br>That's the key word here. Hibiki fucking knows better at this point than to look at a pile of bodies and a non-human monster and to think a monster doll is going to suddenly disobey it's master of its own volition. She wasn't talking to Carol. That would have at least been something somewhat reasonable.<br><br><br> They said that about Phara and Leiur but none of them ever see what Garie's capable of doing yet. <br>You're joking, right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure that Hibiki was able to connect the dots. But like I said, if an opponent looks even remotely human then she'll try to talk to them. She tried to talk to Fine after she had directly or indirectly killed a shitton of people.<br><br>It's been established that Hibiki won't fight other humans except to protect other people. As long as Garie didn't make an aggressive move toward Hibiki or her friends, Hibiki didn't see a reason to transform. As soon as Garie did make an aggressive move, she tried to transform but couldn't. What about this is so hard to understand?</br></br></br>  <br>Where has Hibiki stepped back? Just because she punched one person once in an extremely hot headed moment it doesn't mean she's suddenly become okay with fighting people. In fact everything she says and does after that indicate the exact opposite.</br>  <br> Is that her only response, being rabid and rampaging, whenever someone hurts her feelings? <br>That'd be interesting. Challenge her ideals and she copes by going berserker.</br></br>  <br>She is just making sure she doesn't tsurugis out of the plane for loosing her geah</br>  <br>Just gotta bring her back to life</br>  <br> Hibiki fucking knows better at this point than to look at a pile of bodies and a non-human monster and to think a monster doll is going to suddenly disobey it's master of its own volition  <br>You give Hibiki too much credit.</br></br>  Did they really have to bring the Noise back?  <br> You're joking, right? <br>What? None of them ever saw what Garie can really do with their own eyes yet. And what about the other points in my post?</br></br>  <br> As long as Garie didn't make an aggressive move toward Hibiki or her friends <br>If I see a rabid dog standing over a pile of dead bodies with blood on its mouth, I don't wait till the dog starts charging me before I load my gun.<br><br><br> she punched one person <br>She fought a human being and then talked things out later. She's fought plenty of enemies and tried to reason with them. At this point she won't even put her gear on to defend herself while being attacked. It's stupid.<br><br><br>We joke a lot, but she's not functionally retarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I actually find it kind of sad.<br><br>Why, you ask? Because now that he's made Chris, he can never top that achievement. He must have many years of designing ahead of him, but he'll never make anything that surpasses her.<br><br>This truly is sadness.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would Carol make a group of battle dolls using the same magic but inexplicably make one extraordinarily weaker? <br><br> And what about the other points in my post? <br>Other people have said the same thing. No point in repeating myself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hibiki would, though. That's one of the major aspects of her character. Also Garie isn't a rabid dog, as far as Hibiki is concerned she might be totally sane.<br>You're assuming that Hibiki knows what we know.</br></br>  Is Elf9 a doll?  <br>Fine if you want to be a smart ass then change "fight" to "encounter" it doesn't change what I said about the encounter being what you think it is. <br><br>Also those dolls look human so Hibiki is going to be hesitant plus she usually doesn't start fights.</br></br></br>  <br> We joke a lot, but she's not functionally retarded. <br>She's a naive teenage girl not a soldier.</br></br>  <br>He doesn't have to keep trying, though. He won the battle and the race is over. He gets to kick his feet up and smile while thinking "I did it. I fucking did it."</br>  <br>No obvious doll joints.</br>  <br> If I see a rabid dog standing over a pile of dead bodies with blood on its mouth, I don't wait till the dog starts charging me before I load my gun. <br><br> I don’t like it nor do I understand it <br> better shoot it <br>Are you American, by any chance?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And yet that's still leagues more than she's done this season <br><br>It's almost like it just started or something</br></br></br>  <br>When will Tsubasa stop harassing her juniors?</br>  <br>Maybe it wears a skinsuit.</br>  <br>lewd.</br>  <br> At this point she won't even put her gear on to defend herself while being attacked. It's stupid. <br>How many times do you have to hear that she wants to put it on but she can't. She tried to sing the Gungnir activation song but the words wouldn't come to her. Using your rabbid dog example, it's as if you reached for the gun but your hands are trembling so much you can't even load it properly. That's why I said in another post that the whole difference here is Hibiki's current mental state.</br></br>  <br>Dude, Hibiki wanted to fight but Gungnir didn't work, she has no hax mode anymore so for once her emotional capability is important</br>  <br> it's not like Gungnir can talk to Hibiki <br><br> next episode is Hibiki having an internal discussion with Odin  <br> He's basically Genjuro with an eyepatch and a flowing beard </br></br></br></br>  <br> You're assuming that Hibiki knows what we know. <br>You mean that she's one of the dolls that Carol created like the ones Chris and Tsubasa fought? Hibiki was right there when Garie commented on Carol's having created her.<br><br> Hibiki would, though. <br>You can dress it up however you want, it's still fundamentally stupid.<br><br><br> if you want to be a smart ass <br>By actually referencing the show and the characters actions? <br><br> it doesn't change what I said about the encounter being what you think it is.  <br>And it doesn't change the fact that she used to do more than stand there in stupor without her armor. She's seen and been through things and has taken literally none of those life lessons to heart.<br><br><br> not a soldier. <br> Trained by the strongest <br> Works on secret operations and saves the world <br> Been part of the organization for a long time <br> Not a soldier <br>Ok.<br><br><br>Are you retarded? <br> All signs of logic point towards a dangerous situation where myself and other could be hurt <br> I won't take any precautions so that should things get bad, I'm ready to defend myself <br><br><br>And? That doesn't change the fact that we're still watching events that have taken place after seasons 1 and 2.<br><br><br> How many times do you have to hear that she wants to put it on but she can't. <br>How many times do you have to hear her explicitly say she didn't want to? That's what she said verbatim. Stop pulling shit out of your ass to justify her retardation.<br><br> Using your rabbid dog example, it's as if you reached for the gun but your hands are trembling so much you can't even load it properly. <br>She didn't try loading the gun when she saw the god covered in blood standing atop dead bodies, she tried loading it while the dog was running at her while bearing it's fangs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hibiki wanted to fight <br>Jesus fucking Christ stop saying this. She literally says "戦いたくなんかない！"</br></br>  <br> Are you retarded? <br>No, you are, because you didn’t answer my question.</br></br>  <br> all those replies <br>Whoa. This is advanced autism.</br></br>  <br>Knowing that Miku is a natural born S makes this even better.</br>  <br> Use hyperbole to try and sound smart without actually making a point <br> Comma splice like it's your job <br> Call others retarded <br>Stop posting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You shouldn't be watching this show.</br>  <br>Miku confirmed to fuck anything that moves and at least partially looks feminine</br>  <br>They say that happiness is the blank page of history. We don't get stories without suffering. Maybe this time she can control her autism at last, and stop all this self-deception. However, I worry that this season would probably the first time 'the power of friendship' doesn't work, and Hibiki is forced to solve her problem herself.</br>  <br>You're taking Symphogear seriously. That's wrong. You're wrong.</br>  <br>Actually discussing the show isn't autism, anon.</br>  I don't even know what's going on anymore but Hibiki is a good girl who will find the right path in the end.  <br> Have a problem with how one characters acts stupid in one episode <br>I'll drop it right now.<br><br><br> You're wrong. <br>For expecting a semblance of consistency?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Replying to 6 different people at the same time is.</br>  <br> If you actually try to discuss things instead of dropping a single line with a "funny" comment/insult you're autistic <br>No.</br></br>  <br> For expecting a semblance of consistency? <br>No, for caring too much that there is something which seems inconsistent. I would have expected you to have realized that already, considering it's already the 3rd season and all, but Symphogear is not really about the story telling.</br></br>  <br>It's easier than making 6 seperate posts.</br>  <br>So I guess you are. See, most people outside of burgerland don’t immediately think of shooting someone when they see a human face. That’s a rather human reaction. Thinking of humans (or humanoids for that matter) as “rabid dogs” is the abnormal thing.</br>  <br> For expecting a semblance of consistency? <br><br>Hibiki wants to hold hands. Where did that change? Get out of here with your retardation</br></br></br>  <br>He is just going "nuh uh" and refuses to acknowledge any other point of view/opinion but his.<br>Taking that into account it shouldn't take much effort to write six replies.</br></br>  <br>Is there a shonen manga for this?</br>  <br> For expecting a semblance of consistency? <br>Yes, just watch it for the songs, cute girls and crazy plot twists.</br></br>  <br>Sounds like somebody I know.</br>  <br>And if Carol created her, and if Carol potentially can be reasoned with, then maybe she could reason with Carol's creation too.<br><br>Hibiki doesn't always act perfectly logically. This is an integral part of her character that's been established since Episode 1. Is she being stupid? Maybe, but she's not acting out of character. And then when she saw that Garie was going to attack her, she tried to fight back but couldn't. <br><br>You can not want to fight but still be willing to fight if you have to. Do you think that Hibiki honestly wanted to fight Miku or Chris? And yes, she may technically be a soldier, but she's also a teenage girl with a very kind heart, and teenage girls don't tend to be the best decision makers. All of this heavy crap is being forced onto a young girl who already has a lot of heavy crap that she's lugging around, it makes sense that she doesn't act like some perfect space marine like you obviously want her to.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She knows it's a doll.

If you look at all the Tokyo ghoul color pages/volume all the ghouls eye are red iris with white sclera while Uta's is red iris with black sclera. I don't know why Ishida did it that way because you can't tell the difference in the black and white pages.  <br><br>fuck off faggot</br></br>  <br>And where is Hide?</br>  <br>What's your problem?</br>  <br>Chie is really best friend of Shuu</br>  <br><br>Million Dollar Question<br><br>NewFag detected</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's not in charge of interrogation anymore, he is a combat instructor now.</br>  <br> being boastful over making a thread <br>Must be fun feeling euphoric newfaggot, lurk moar</br></br>  <br>Have been arround for 5 years</br>  <br>Because Kaneki got his white hair in volume 6, We are in volume 3, chapter 37, 3 chapters left to end the volume, then 10 chapter until volume 6</br>  I'm so fucking confused<br><br>too many characters I don't remember the name of or even care for<br><br>entire manga's a mess</br></br></br></br>  HAHA MOMS GONNA FREAK WHEN SHE FINDS OUT I LOST MY MEMORY  <br> entire manga's a mess <br>Ishida really needs to kill a couple of them.

For the past three weeks it's been just people walking around and meetings.  <br>Tokyo Ghoul has always been like this, inbetween arcs there are 4-5 chapters focusing on some general stuff before the new arc starts, it's worth the wait.</br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br>Stop being a speed reader</br>  <br>Someone send this to Ishida's twitter.</br>  <br>Tokyo Ghoul :REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEE</wbr></wbr></br>  <br><br> it's worth the wait <br>SoL in TG, yeah, they worth the waiting. SoL in :re is baring as hell because the main crew are boring as hell. If I learned something from the Auction Raid is that when the plot focused on MCs I am going to be disappointed.</br></br></br>  Is this what Tokyo Ghoul threads have become? I hope you faggots all die in a fucking fire.  <br> Is this what Tokyo Ghoul threads have become? <br>The thread was done by a shitpoters, niggas keep replying. This is what happened when a shitpoter makes the thread.</br></br>  When the hell is Kineki getting his memories back? I can't really see the plot move forward unless this happens  <br>God, the newfag is always strong in these threads. That shit anime opened the flood gate and these faggots are charging in with their shitty tumblr pics. <br>If I can make one prediction is that Mutsuki will accept that she is a girl and the tumblrfags will be so butthurt that they will press charges against Ishida for rape and triggering them with the truth.</br></br>  Haise wont suffer r-right?  Ishida is introducing too much CCG characters... he needs to kill of some.<br><br>The rest are well 4/10 only for a little push when Faggyama sees Haise.</br></br>  <br>So is this guy going to torture another character and make Kaneki have another meltdown?</br>   /a   <br> yamori torturer  <br> new </br></br>  <br>what if he tortures hinami for info?</br>  <br>What about ownership rights do you not understand?</br>  <br>He has to let her go eventually.</br>  <br> He blamed a young poor boy like Rei for torture nekos <br> He worry about the private property  <br><br>A hot and restricted girl I mean ghoul is confined alone in a gigantic prison and nobody aside of Haise worry about her.</br></br></br></br>  <br> In ghouls' bodies, there are "cell pipes" through which the Rc cells flow (I guess like blood veins?) and that extend from the kakuhou. One can enhance one's bodily abilities by increasing the number of these pipes. <br> The way to increase the number of pipes is by being injured and then regenerating countless times, because these pipes remain after regenerating. <br><br> Shiba even shows Urie an x-ray image of Sasaki, and comments that these "pipes" are everywhere in his body. <br><br> Shiba concludes: <br>"Quinx, half-ghouls - you become stronger to the extent you were hurt."<br><br> I guess these pipes naturally already exist in normal ghouls' bodies, but obviously do not exist at the start in the bodies of artificial ghouls. So I don't know if this "training method" works (well) for normal ghouls. <br><br> So basically, Urie is now deliberately overstraining and tearing his muscles </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Where are these spoilers from</br></br>  <br>Batotofags.<br>This infomation also explained why kaneki became so much stronger after tortured by yamori.</br></br>  <br> Urie is now deliberately overstraining and tearing his muscles <br>This little bitch is going to go batshit soon and I'm going to enjoy it.<br><br>I suppose they are from landwhales' favorite shithole.</br></br></br></br>  <br>da hell!!! the ghouls are saiyan</br>  <br><br>Why does this remember me about the zenkai?<br> yeah, I am watching DBZ out of boredom </br></br></br>  <br><br>netabare</br></br>  <br> the ghouls are saiyan <br>Please, stop with the fucking power levels, Ishida. I want a dystopian story, not a shonen tier manga.</br></br>  <br><br>It's practically basic muscle confusion. What are you on about?</br></br>  <br>Muscle confusion is bullshit and so are you for defending this.</br>  <br>Now THAT'S what I call edgy. Good job being metal Urine</br>  Why were the spoilers out so extremely early? Does this mean I don't have to stay up?  Tokyo Ghoul is turning into Bleach. At least Kubo had the foresight to introduce saiyan regen early on, this is just being thrown into the fucking sequel of the original.  Just stop making these threads until the author reaches chapter 100. It's not gonna be good until at least that point, maybe never.  <br> I-I have no idea what I am talking about. </br>  <br> muscle confusion <br> real <br><br>jesus christ</br></br></br></br>  <br>Muscle confusion is bro science, get off it.</br>  <br>cry more you pleb<br><br><br>They been regrowing limbs and organs left and right since volume one you fucking retard</br></br></br></br>  <br> Tokyo Ghoul is turning into Bleach <br>I hate you because you are right. Damn it, at least I hope Ishida doesn't use this in a bullshit way.</br></br>  <br>To begin with this isn't even muscle confusion, it's fucking micro trauma.</br>  <br>You hear about madhouse redoing the anime?</br>  Tokyo Ghoul used to be cool. I don't feel edgy or angsty when I read it anymore.<br><br>What happened.</br></br>  <br>In volume one the ghouls who could regrow limbs and organs on the fly were super special rinkaku fairies. Since you know, accelerated regen is common with rinkaku ghouls.</br>  You'll never get a chance to fuck his filename  <br>Kaneki is too happy these days. He's too good at protecting faggots.</br>  <br>Stop.<br>Buying.<br>Rumors.<br><br>That shit just won't happen for a long fucking time, if it even will happen.<br><br>Listen to /a/, and only /a/. Fuck all the other "sources" like forums and tumblr.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You hear about madhouse redoing the anime? <br>Yeah, that day I won 1 million dollars.</br></br>  <br>Oh fucking thank you. Its basically following the concept of how fighters micro crack their bones training and when it heals fully the bone becomes stronger</br>  <br>I want more suffering and painful emotions. Not this happy family crap<br><br>For example, Hinami should have been sacrificed for literary progress by now</br></br></br>  <br> Trying to defend yourself and failing.  <br><br><br>Ok bud. Lmk when you guys actually bring arguments and not spit nonsense. Worse than tumblr ever has been.</br></br></br></br>  <br> What happened. <br>Amnesia and muh fake family killed TG.</br></br>   For example, Hinami should have been sacrificed for literary progress by now.  <br><br>And what good would that do? Your idea is akame ga kill tier bad.</br></br>  <br>She would have been cut down in her prime instead of turning stupid little shitter. The suffering could have jolted Haise back into Kaneki or fucked with him. Haise should have lasted no more than 10 chapters.</br>  <br>Pierrot's wiping their asses with the rights. An OVA is about to come out and Root A finished only a few months ago.<br><br>A remake won't happen. Pierrot are the same shitters that adapted all of Naruto.</br></br></br>  <br> Since you know, accelerated regen is common with rinkaku ghouls. <br>I'm almost offended of how beta you think I am, but yes that's what I was pointing out that regen and regen asspulls has always been a thing in tokyo ghoul. It wasn't volume one but it should have been recognized that cheap tricks were going to increase when Tsukiyama was able to survive by auto cannibalism even though his RC cells are supposed to be the densest out of the kagunes since koukaku</br></br>  <br>Micro trauma in muscle tissue, aka micro tears, which is normal to progression in resistance training. Fighters do a mix of heavy lifting and martial arts training, heavy lifting at ~80% of 1RM contributes to increased bone density. Joints cannot ever be strengthened.<br><br>What he aims to do is overtrain as stated above, when you overtrain basically your "micro traumas" have piled up and become larger traumas, or injuries to the tissues, causing you to exceed your current level of restitution.</br></br></br>  <br>Go post that bullcrap on /fit/, hell even misc will call you out for being a faggot.</br>  <br>Yeah that's bad.</br>  Will Franky ever make his own version of pacifista?
