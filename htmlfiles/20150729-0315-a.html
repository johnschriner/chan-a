[ http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87 <br><br>Does The World stop time, or speed it and its user up?</br></br>  <br>Have you tried reading the manga?</br>  <br>DIO/Jotaro can command time to stop, but Pucci is later shown to be faster than the "timestop"? That means the the effect has a time value, i.e. super speed.<br><br>I could be wrong though.</br></br></br>  <br>You are wrong, try reading the manga.</br>  What did Karera do /a/? Did she steal something from the twins? She seems like such a lousy person, definitely not someone I'd like as a friend. <br><br>In other news Jojolion ch 50 and Jump Festa will be on the same day this year. Maybe something nice will happen?</br></br>  <br>How about providing an example you faggot anon</br>  <br>IIRC pucci isnt faster than timestop, as jotaro did prevent him from moving, its just pucci fast forwarding the universe drastically reduced the amount of time jotaro could stop time for.</br>  <br> SC original movie  :^)</br>  <br>Ah, that makes sense.</br>  LISA LISA<br>I<br>S<br>A<br><br>L<br>I<br>S<br>A</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  posting IRL stands  <br>it bothered me that it didn't effect all the rest of the times Jotaro stopped time. Fucking Araki-ism right there.</br>          <br>alt</br>      <br> Posting best Stand <br>Good job anon.</br></br>      <br>who is the semen demon in the middle?</br>  <br>Here's a better version.</br>  <br>did I do good?</br>      It's been 4 months since Rolling Girls finale<br>How do you Hibikeep it real?</br>  God that anime was garbage  I thank God every day for this trash never getting a S2.  <br><br>Shit taste detected.</br></br>  I listen to the covers of the songs.  Have the chibi specials not been completely subbed yet? I can only find up to #4.  I still regularly listen to the soundtrack.  <br><br>My niggas.</br></br>  <br> nothing happens the show <br><br>And not in a good way.</br></br></br>   4 months <br>Make the time ride stop, it's going too fast.</br>  Best Blue Hearts' cover?<br>It's Yuugure for me.</br>  Has the BD raw of its last two episodes out yet?  <br>Owaranai Uta. It was exciting as fuck to hear it play in the last episode during that fight.</br>  <br>I'm fond of Train Train and Stones.</br>  Post yfw<br><br> "Bye-bye" </br></br>    <br>I really do hope she comes back on the last chibi special. It's the last hope I have.</br>  New covers coming out on the second of august. The only good thing about this anime  Give me 3 reasons why Akane isn't best girl.  1) Ukyou<br>2) Ranma-chan<br>3) Kodachi</br></br>  <br>Ranma is best girl.<br>Ukyou is best boy.<br>Fuck this story for not going best route.</br></br></br>  <br>onnateki Ranma<br>Yoiko<br>Pigtailed girl</br></br></br>  <br>There was only one best route, and what you named wasn't it.</br>  Doesn't get along well with Ranma, so their interactions are just the stock "I hate you but secretly I love you" with no decent progress over the manga's long lifespan.<br>Not a good fighter compared to others.<br>Can't accept criticism well, like how she's always pushing her terrible cooking, meaning she won't change at all.</br></br>  <br>Ranma x Ryoga is best, everyone agreees</br>  Her personallity is literally worse than shit.   shitty cook <br> short hair <br> worst figure </br></br>  1. Shampoo <br>2. Ukyo<br>3. The fact that she can be a royal pain in the ass.</br></br>  <br>1) Unreliable tsundere that prefer the "punch first, ask question later" approach even if she's the weakest of the cast<br><br>2) Her sisters are way hotter and better in their own fields<br><br>3) When your so-called fiancee is (litteraly) a better woman than you, you know you suck</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Okay. <br><br>1. built like a stick<br>2. dumb as a brick<br>3. talks like a hick</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I liked her better in Inuyasha</br>  <br><br>I thought the final arc actually did cut to the heart of Ranma's feelings and also did a good job at showing how the characters had leveled up in their skills. I think the series would have ended better if the manga had them get married instead of LOL so random, wedding ruined.</br></br>  What went wrong?  Your birth.

I'm only recommending for an average man's workout to stay not-fat. You probably know your body well enough to balance your own diet and exercise, but I would recommend doing 1.5-2 hours per day (not all in one go). Maybe take a break from the anime and the computer screen to digest the episode while you run. Get to reflect and think while you exercise. <br>Also remember your pushups. those are easy to remember. Just do it before every meal. three sets of six. so do 6 pushups, wait 15 seconds, do 6 more, wait 15 seconds, and then do another 6, then eat.</br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw watching this entire thing </br>    <br>The nose bridges are similar in structure if not downright the same.

In reality this isn't a hikkineet pandering show, it shows that you can have fun slacking off once you're done with your duties and have a happy life. Look at Umaru, she could be anxious and obsessed with her peers and with school but instead she just doesn't give a shit, pays attention during class, studies before exams as a result does well and just thinks about video games and snacks.</br>  <br>I need the sauce of that.</br>  So anons, who preordered the hoodie?  <br>I was thinking of getting one, but I'm a man and i'm not sure how a hamster shawl would look on a male.</br>  <br>who cares, noone else will see you, I wouldn't buy one because hell whats the fucking point but if all you're worried about is what people might think, then noone will think anything</br>  <br>I want one but I am poor as fuck right now and don't know how much it costs</br>  <br>Looks like they're about 5000. I kind of want one too.</br>  <br>What's interesting is this is more or less the exact same message of Evangelion. 90s NEETs didn't have it so badly they actually needed to withdraw from the world. They can find some way to participate in a minimal way, or even if they're lucky in a real and satifying way, and still enjoy their hobbies and not have their identity subsumed into the monoculture, or whatever. I guess it's not surprising exactly that the same message has to be repeated again and again to each new generation of otaku though.</br>  <br>Nice blog where's the titter button I want to follow your every update.<br>:^)</br></br>  <br>Absolutely nothing.</br>  <br>Can someone shoop out her arm so she looks like a cute little blob?</br>  <br>;^)</br>  <br>You claim to filter yet you reply.<br>Nice going champ.</br></br>  <br> Kyoani mousepad <br>superb taste, anon</br></br>  <br> No octopus sucker snack <br> No hamster hood <br><br>1/10 that photo is shit</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying you aren't just jello of my white lolita cookies </br>  <br>And it's drawn by a nip woman.</br>  <br>Do japs measure in liters?<br><br>It was my understanding that americans did everything assbackwards <br>This is coming from an american too</br></br></br></br>  <br>That has to be at least $100 in junk food.</br>  <br>Well it's really easy to get sick of the world and just hide away with things you like.

You're taught the difference between weight and volume in your country, right?</br>  <br>not even american though, you're just talking straight bullshit<br> of water <br>yeah, that's the point, ever heard of density? just saying but I've spent a lot of my time in chemistry/biology labs and if I measured every liquid as if it was 1l/1kg then I would've been kicked out on the first day<br>you know, drink are mostly made of water so it's more or less the same as in kgs but from a proper scientific pov 1l is not necessarily 1kg</br></br></br></br>  <br>Vitamin D deficiency ;^)<br><br><br>I was in a locker room once and some guys were joking around weighing themselves before and after peeing.<br><br>They said, "lol I don't know how much water weighs" and I gave them a dirty look.

Compared to Ebina whose parents are renting her an apartment and still performs as shit she's an example citizen.

The lights above her blinked and sparked out of the air. There were infected in the school. She didn’t see them, but had expected them now for days. Her note to her students were not read to and now it was too late. Far too late for now, anyway.<br>Megumi was a school teacher for fourteen months. When she was teaching she watched the highschoolers and she said to the principal “I want to be teach at the school.”<br>principal said “No! You will BE KILL BY INFECTED”<br>There was a time when she believed him. Then as she got working he stopped. But now in the Megugaoka High school of the Yokosuka she knew there were infected.<br><br><br>“This is Kurumi” the megaphone crackered. “You must find the antidote!”<br>So Megumi left her emergency manual and opened the shutter.<br>“IT GOING TO KILL US” said the Rii<br>“I will shove at him” said the Shovel and she shoved the shovel. Megumi ran at him and tried to shack him off. But then the ceiling fell and they were trapped and not able to kill.<br>“No! I must kill the zombies” she shouted<br>The radio said “No, Megu-nee. You are the zombies”<br>And then Yuki was a retard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Text in pictures isn't hard, but mspaint isn't the best so I can't help.</br>   I think Hika's a zombie. She was driven off by the other group when she received a very minor injury with the other girls following her, hence her reacting when Kurumi brought them up. The entire other group of violent hyper-pragmatists couldn't reach the food store and generator despite massive tensions due to the lack of electricity, but apparently Hika alone was able to find it - perhaps thanks to zombie stealth. That would also have been where the serum was, whether or not she's mentioned it to the others yet or not.   <br>It's a lot harder than people think.<br><br>Or at least a lot more tedious.</br></br></br>  <br>Just dropping the size and centering would improve it.

Looks more like a pool net or broom.</br>    <br>Episode of the year</br>  <br>Kurumi's bust size seems inconsistent.</br>  <br>It's her shovel.

Why did he destroy the medicine? Was it because it had terrible consequences?<br>Why did he get infected? Is it because the disease could be transmitted airborne?<br> Kurumi's already dead isn't she? </br></br>  <br>Definitely a broom. She doesn't seem comfortable without some wood in her hands.</br>  <br>There is an airborne disease, but we don't know how he was infected. He crushed the picture and the medicine because lol zombie tremors.</br>  <br>why the fuck are you namefagging</br>  <br>Welcome to /gg/.</br>  <br>Why are you such a fucking idiot incapable of reading blatant visual cues?</br>  <br>non namefags pls go.<br> just kidding </br></br>  <br>No, there's not anything airborne. There has been literally nothing indicating that.<br><br><br>Here. Use your eyes. He's just meant to indicate that the serum isn't permanent and must be reapplied and to foreshadow what's gonna happen to Kurumi.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But thinking of the most obvious conclusions is boring.</br>  <br>Radio girl gets infected inside isolated bunker</br>  <br>Radio girl was already infected, like pilot-kun, and went through her serum supply. If there was anything airborne, all the School Living Club would be dead by now as they all were in Radio-chan's bunker.</br>  <br>She could have been infected before going into the bunker.<br><br>Hell, she could have not been infected at all and just have been sick and lonely.</br></br></br>  <br> There has been literally nothing indicating that. <br>The hazmat suits imply it might be. At least one of the strains might be.</br></br>  <br>This is why I hate these threads. People like you keep making stupid conclusions up while people like  completely points out why you're wrong.<br><br>Every time, every thread.</br></br></br>  <br>Just finished watching the first two episodes, Kurumi is hard as fuck.<br><br>What's the general consensus on the show thus far? I'm enjoying it, but haven't read the source. Is the adaption generally doing a good job so far/Is the source worth going through or should I just keep watching?</br></br></br>  <br>anon if he's namefagging he's probably baiting or just a newfag. In either case, you shouldn't reply to him.</br>  <br>I agree. She's better than Yuki. She gets shit done. Yuki's annoying but really without her they would all be crazy or something.</br>  <br>They've been changing a few things  for the better . It's generally a good thing to read the source though because  Megu-nee is dead. </br>  <br>Most people not drop it and pretty positive response.<br>Beware the fanbase though.<br>As usual read the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>If you want to stick around GG threads, read the source material. If you want to experience the anime without spoiling yourself with the manga, you'd best avoid these threads.

As it is they are cutting away dialogue or exposition at every turn just to make it in time but I also understand that lots and lots of talking would bore casuals even if they come complete with diagrams or flash backs during monologues and what not. Ah fuck it there's no point wondering about what could have been when this is clearly a cheap commercial where the budget is focused on certain scenes and being an outlet for So-Based to draw some more shit.

But you can see how fucked up Ainz's mana bar is when it literally goes off the section.</br>  <br>Is Overlord any good?</br>  <br>What happens if the skeleton inside your body tries to kill you?</br>  <br>I think it's called 'bone cancer'.</br>  <br>spooky</br>  <br>there's something else that baffles me: I used to think that the battle maids were the strongest NPC group after the guardians, Sebas and Pandora's actor but then in volume 4 we learn of the existence of cocytus' level 100 servants who are supposedly stronger. so how many damn level 100 NPC are in Nazarick? also, as we know that Ainz can conjure level 80+ monsters, is it safe to say that battle maids are useless power wise?</br>  <br>AOTD</br>  <br>Too spooky for me.</br>  <br>I don't know where you get level 100 from, cause I've never read anywhere that Nazarick has level 100 nameless npcs other than possibly the Avatara.<br><br>However, there are plenty of level 90 npcs, like the dragons Aura and Mare ride. Demiurge's 7th floor supposedly has a level 90 that is stronger than the weaker floor guardians giving you a glimpse of how RP-mode Nazarick actually is when it doesn't involve the 8th floor.<br><br>If you read the first vol you should know that the battle maids are merely there to stall time on the 9th floor along with Sebas while the players of AOG revive at the 10th floor in order to make their last stand in a Final Boss fashion.</br></br></br></br></br>  Choose your destiny.    <br><br>Whoa, that's too spooky anon.</br></br>  What qualifies as a non human? Touch Me is just a guy with a mask, another dude is a birdman  <br>Touch me is draconian.</br>  <br>Has it actually been confirmed?</br>  <br>Ghost Skeleton<br>Top Hat<br>Flight<br>Time Travel<br>Underwater Ruins<br>Kelly Goldstein<br><br>Dr. Bones<br>Fitz<br>Patches<br>Diary<br>Lesbian Rally<br><br>It'd be an amazing adventure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not in the translated novels so far at least.</br>   Justice has Arrived. <br><br>How much did this special effect cost I wonder.</br></br>  <br><br>Why was his name Touch Me?</br></br>  <br>is that really enough to be a non human? It's like hey I might look totally like a human but I'm actually a nymph :^), whats the point</br>  <br>The point is that you get extra stats with the disadvantage that people can murder you at no penalty.</br>  <br>Delet this</br>  <br>Normal Skeleton<br>Top Hat<br>Magnetic Bones <br>Time Travel<br>Spooky Tomb<br>Mayor Smith<br><br>Patches<br>Dr.Bones<br>Ezekiel<br>Diary<br>Lapsed Rapist</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't know where you get level 100 from <br>I misread that, it is only stated that Cocytus' nameless servants are stronger than Entoma.</br></br>  <br>that sounds pretty fun</br>  <br>2spooky4u?</br>  <br>Shimoneta has a narration break in the intro to similar to 80's action tv shows.</br>  <br>Is Ainz greatest threat  osteoporosis ?</br>  <br>That sounds like a world class item. So I guess his fears were true after all.</br>  <br>I doubt I'll sleep tonight after seeing this.</br>  <br>The maids are formation fighters, on their own they crumble really fast but together they'll make you stand in one place until the big boys manage to put their boots on.</br>  <br>He probably a fan of Rocky Horror Picture Show.</br>  <br>Which is really weird cause their youngest resides on the only floor that matters.

Demiurge explicitly shows signs of disagreement in the novel, though in the anime they skip that whole part.</br>  <br>I named my wifi CZ2128</br>  <br> this channel is currently offline </br>  <br>Well gee M.

SASUGA AINZ-SAMA  AINZ OOWN GOAL SAMA BANZAI  AINZ OOWN GOAL-SAMA<br>BANZAI</br>  We didn't get demiurge alternate explanation ?    Oh? Are those her brides? They're cute.  That was the shortest episode in the history of short episodes..  Next Tuesday when?   <br>oops, misspelled it.</br>  AINZ OOAL GOWN SAMA BANZAI  SHIIIIIT.<br><br>They didn't have the misunderstanding at the end.</br></br>    Aw c'mon, they left out the part after his speech. That was important.  SASUGA HEINZ WOOL GOON  <br>6d 23h 36m</br>  <br>M-maybe after the ED?</br>  <br> I...I'm fucked </br>  <br>It's a bit different from the novel where she used a spell, but then again they changed a ton of things like taking off the mask and helmet and then skipping reporting back to the village and such.<br><br>Basically there's always these continuity changes just because they feel it'll be more cool. I do like the iron ball launcher though since I never really had a grasp from the novel translations how it worked.</br></br></br>  It's weird, this episode felt rushed, but nothing of importance was omitted. Why?  AFTER THE ED.!!!!!!  <br>Nope, there it is</br>  <br>Oh, nvm, there it is lol</br>  Meh not much happened this ep huh  There it is!    <br><br>W-what was it?</br></br>  Torrent when  Fuck just got in the stream and already DONT YOU LOVE ME WITH PASSION  Good stuff. Kinda wish they put in the Neuronist bit though.  Hmm, although a bit rushed, it could have gone a lot worse. Not a bad episode. <br><br><br>either read the novel or watch the episode later.</br></br></br>  <br> this bait <br>I can see people falling for it.</br></br>    <br>Hour or so.</br>  <br>Subs when?</br>  <br> left to right <br>pls fix</br></br>  <br>See, the helmet fucks up the whole armor design. They could have put a little bit more thought into it. Although she's cute without it too.</br>  <br>Demiurge misunderstanding Ainz "I'd like this jewel box lol" for "Nazarick, I order you to conquer this world for me"</br>  <br>which sets in motion a ton of bullshit later that Ainz doesn't even know about.</br>  <br> It's weird, this episode felt rushed, but nothing of importance was omitted. <br>I guess you can say this episode is pretty bare bones.</br></br>  What happened to Gazef and Ainz meeting after the battle? Did they skip it?  <br> he doesn't wait till the season finished airing <br><br>Pleb, plebs all of you.</br></br></br>  <br>They didn't even show him killing those mages. Shitty cg without gore is just shitty cg.</br>  <br>A new kind of censoring mayhaps?</br>  <br>Well, he's not totally wrong. In terms of plot progression, not a whole lot happened. The fight was fun, sure, but the information gathered to time spent ratio was pretty low.</br>  It sounds like they cut out on the whole Slane Theocracy doctrine and Six Gods stuff, but I suppose that'll be put during the next few episodes?  <br>budum tsh</br>  <br>When the death knight killed those soldiers that looked cool. But this time it was just cardboard angels getting pulled around on strings.</br>  <br>it kinda distrupts the flow of battle<br>still better to put them in non action scenes</br></br>    <br>Of course it did, and people here don't think it's important so no one cares. Just like everything else.</br>    <br>Perfect.</br>  <br>Ainz declared the goal of Nazarick, Demiurge's misunderstanding has set the whole show on the road. The plot has started in earnest. Just because it wasn't spelled out doesn't mean nothing happened.</br>  <br>not to mention they skipped the part where he trys to force conscript Ainz.</br>  <br>Cute. Flustered Albedo is the best.</br>  <br>it wasnt really that important though</br>  <br>It shows they didn't part on bad terms and Ainz has a connection in the Kingdom he can exploit. The way it ended, sure you can assume Gazef is eternally grateful but there's really no confirmation.</br>  HorribleSubs is out.  <br>It's sad cause a lot of the fun is the monologue/dialogue hype up and getting to see how everyone overreacts or shits their pants.<br><br>I mean logically speaking, everyone enjoyed the drama cds, yet all it consists of is dialogue and monologue, with the action parts being by far the shittiest since there's no moving pictures. So why the 180 turn on the anime?<br><br>And given how they keep changing up little bits of detail here and there, the drama CDs are more canon than the anime so far.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why? It wouldn't take too long, especially the attempt at forced conscription. Literally just 2 or 3 sentences.</br></br>  4 WEEKS TO HUG  <br>well, he does ask him if he can hire him, but he doesn't ask him the extra two or three times he's supposed to. So meh.</br>  <br> why are drama cds different from anime <br>uhh...... also it's just 13 eps, maybe if it was 50 they could fit all the shit they want but with a short time like that they need to skip the fluff and get on with it</br></br>  <br>Just like how it's not important Nigan compares Ainz with the Black Scripture who is currently guarding the WC robe preparing for the rezzing of the DK who turned out to be a false alarm cause of Sebas, or reveals there's 3 great treasures, or that oh wait none of this is important and will absolutely not come into play in the future.</br>  <br>I guess the anime took a more shounen approach? At least in this episode it did.</br>  <br>Because his build made it so that if you attacked him or did damage to him you took a boatload in retaliation damage. So he was running around advertising it.</br>  So are we mad now that they skip some important parts? Honestly dragging it would take another episode of talking.  <br>Well it's not going to be important since the anime will never reach that point and it's not like anime only watchers have good attention spans.</br>  <br>nah, it doesn't bother me so much. At least they covered the important stuff.</br>  <br>Did they skip Nigan talking about the traitor who stole the miko crown?</br>  <br>I'm confused at how to feel, honestly. On one hand I understand they couldn't adapt the entire thing straight, a few omissions and skipping was guaranteed to happen. On the other hand, stuff like  being omitted confuses me. Is it even possible for them to shoehorn them in the series later?<br>Like there's no reason for Nigun to make any comparisons now when he didn't before.</br></br>  <br>So we aren't even covering volume 3? Cause I'm pretty sure the Black Scripture encounters Shalltear with their WC robe granny.</br>  <br>This ep was already boring as is, if more of it would've been just standing around with CGI birds there would've been no point in making it into an anime. It's just some stupid rpg setting anyways so I don't give much of a shit about muh lore, I wanna see people kill shit.</br>  <br>Nigun talking about this shit directly relates to Clementine in volume 2, a sort of foreshadowing, if you will.</br>  <br>Of course, it's not like it's important or anything and since this is an anime we clearly won't cover what happens to the traitor or what she stole either.</br>  <br> See <br>Looks like you were right.</br></br>  <br>jesus just stop whining already, nobody gives a fuck</br>  <br>What if the her horns aren't so durable looking, and the helmet horns are used to protect them?</br>  <br> lelelele attention span shounenfags xD <br>Nah, I don't mind watching/reading dialogue based stories if they're actually interesting, like haibane renmei, mushishi, monogatari, hyouka etc but when it's just some shitty rpg skellington killing people then I cannot give less of a shit about muh lore.</br></br>  <br>all I'm sayin is that her helmet makes her look like a ruin sentinel and it bugs me. But oh well.</br>  <br>That's why people are agreeing with me of course.</br>  <br> who is clementine? </br>  <br>So when it involves chuunis in real life it's interesting, but when chuunis get transported into their chuuni delusion world it's shit.</br>  <br>What she did in the end is insignificant, same with Nigan's monologues about the treasures and so on.<br><br>Even in novels the Nigans ramblings have yet to play out from the 13H/DG and they havent found out that Ainz destroyed the artifact.<br><br>Same with how Gazef's musing about Ainz and his plea changes nothing. The 3rd vol interlude is far better place to explore the Kingdom's issues and Gazef/factions. Even if they dont play out until 5&amp;6.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>most people are saying they don't give a shit, it's only you and maybe one other guy who keeps crying</br>  <br>Your sarcasm meter is broken go say hello to this faggot </br>  <br>If it's interesting dialogue it's interesting, when it's boring muh powerlevels muh stats shit then I cannot care.</br>  <br>most people are saying they think it's stupid, it's only you and maybe one other guy who keeps sperging out</br>  <br>are you really this autistic? well, I guess you don't need to answer</br>  <br>So you admit you never read the LNs, okay. One more evidence on how secondaries perceive Overlord completely different.</br>  <br>Maybe you'd have a better time reading the novels, then.</br>  <br>there's literally only 2 of you. You and the guy who only watches the anime nobody else agrees with you so stop dodging.</br>  <br>You're a better anon than me. I couldn't find the energy to deal with his stupidity.</br>  <br> tfw secondaries actually believe this is just another SAO/Log Horizon </br>  <br>I've read most of the monogatari novels and almost finished with okitegami kyouko. I don't read shitty shounen novels.</br>  <br>good thing it's mostly interesting dialog and the powerlevel shit doesn't come up much</br>  <br>Here we go.</br>  <br>Thanks for making things clear. And good to know we can ignore any other shit you dump.</br>  <br>Enjoy your SAO 2.0 then scrublord. I hope they cut more worthless shit out and show stuff that people actually want to see.</br>  Why are you retards responding to the ruseman?  <br>Like girls talking to each other trying to sound deep while acting as fap fodder?</br>   not reading the novels for plot and story and watching the anime to see the fight scenes visualized <br><br>Why are some people so retarded that they can't just do it that way? Simply seeing the anime as a help to imagine how some scenes actually would look like is by far the easiest solution.</br></br>  <br> muh battle shounens are so intellectual hurrrhurrrhurr <br>Yeah whatever faggot.</br></br>  <br> muh <br>into the garbage he goes</br></br>  <br>At least nisio's pretentious shit is interesting, oh yeah and I've read most of zaregoto too a while back, unlike muh stats muh world items muh mmorpg</br>     Downloading raws so I can save about 1hr and 40mins of wait for subs <br><br>What monster, have I become?</br></br>  So can we assume that episodes titles from here on out will follow the chapter names 1 to 1?  <br>I'll give a shit about that when an action scene actually rivals Tigre being fancy with his bow.</br>  <br>If you're an LN-fag then you're just watching it for the fight scenes anyways.</br>  <br>Oh I see now I should've realised. After all this another "I'm trapped in an MMORPG golly jee!!" anime. This sort of shit always has the most cancerous and defensive fanbase.</br>  I really wish this show was more about the monsters and less about, you know, humans.  <br>but anon, humans are the monsters</br>  <br>Does she even terminate someone in this form?<br><br>As in  lamprey style ?</br></br></br>  <br> At least nisio's pretentious shit is interesting <br><br>Are you one of those guys that laughs at people cosplaying but wears waifu t-shirts? Cause that's what you look like right now.<br><br>We get it, you let your dick do the talking, there's probably more brain cells down there anyways.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Buddy you better believe it. And it'll get animated, too. </br>  <br>Agreed.<br><br>Humans are both inherently good and evil.<br><br>Thus among them there can even be complete saints...or aforementioned monsters.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't leave corpses?</br>  Did i miss the stream?  <br>yes</br>  <br>t-thanks</br>  <br>Good thing overlord isn't filled with sluts, oh wait.

His transformation into Gon-san wasn't only him literally 'growing up', but having to deal with an adult situation with the morality of a child. He mentally broke under the weight of the dilemma.</br>  <br>He's naturally empathetic though, there's literally no reason to think he's mimicking it to seem normal. He's a decent kid, just doesn't have strong ethical principles unless he's personally invested in the situation. He's also extremely emotional during the entirety of his breakdown.</br>  <br>He's cute</br>  He ain' right in da head.  <br>But I want to fuck him, and that's what really matters.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128686179 <br>why the fuck would you make a husbando out of an armadillo</br>  <br>OP, I've thought it like that before.<br><br>But now, I'm more inclined to believe Gon is simply a mature person stuck in a kid's body.

You see Gon do something something in an unfimilliar way and assume the worse, even though it's clearly obviouse he is caplable of a strong sense of morals, empathy, and standards.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best guard didn't deserve such a tragic end.</br>  <br>Reminder to report everything this anon quoted, gender shitposting should not be tolerated</br>  <br>All qt boys get tragic ends.</br>  <br>But it's not right</br>  Gon is a fucking angel you retard    gon a slut  <br>He's a sweet boy</br>  <br>But he's only promiscuous towards one boy.</br>  <br>He only cares about people closest to him.

He doesn't really care much about anyone other than his close friends, he's actually kind of an hypocrite when it comes to this.<br>Look at when he wanted to take Hisoka's badge, he was okay with using someone's death at his advantage but only if it wasn't one of his friends.</br></br>  <br>I don't see how he's a hypocrite. He never claimed to care about everyone.</br>  <br>Go read the manga, nobody in HxH gives a shit about strangers, and for good reason. If you want to give Gon shit for not caring about total strangers then you'd have to say the same thing about Killua, Leorio, and Kurapika.<br><br> also giving a shit about a bunch of kidnappers who were going to hurt your friend, simply to win a match. </br></br></br>  <br>I know, that's why i said "kind of". I still think he's a nice kid, just that he was put in a bunch of really shitty situations.</br>  There isn't a HxH general anymore so I'll ask here...<br><br>Can anyone post the Hisoka's version of pic related? I can't find it anywhere...</br></br>  <br>I got you anon</br>    <br> There isn't a HxH general anymore <br>What?</br></br>    <br><br>Psychopaths are at best, indifferent to their relatives and loved ones.<br><br>Gon has shown to care deeply for his friends.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He is a miracle of the universe. He just needs therapy.</br>  <br> headcanon <br>Isn't that literally what he said to Meleoron?</br></br>  <br>Basically, but it's off base to say Gon wants people to be evil so he can beat them. It's just easier on him if someone they are.</br>  <br> defeat <br>What was the word use in moonspeak? I keep seeing different translations for this scene.</br></br>  <br>My nip is shit so I can't say anything about the implications but I can at least look up the word 倒す<br> 1. to throw down; to bring down; to blow down; to fell; to knock down; to set (something) down on its side; to turn (something) on its side <br> 2. to kill; to defeat; to beat </br></br></br>  Pitou a best girl. No other Hunter x Hunter girl will ever come close.  <br>There are so many things wrong with this post that I don't even know where to start.</br>  <br>Thanks anon, i get the idea. I guess "to kill" would have been a bit too extreme.<br>And you're right, i don't think Gon cares much about someone being evil, like Zepile pointed out. I think he just really has a simple thought process regarding potential enemies, which is part of the reason he couldn't handle the whole Pitou situation.<br>Funnily enough, Meleoron and Zepile both say something similar about "not seeing an end to his limit", i'm not too sure what they meant by that though.</br></br></br>  Did the show go through any sort of timeslot changes or anything? I've always been interested as to why they kept things light during parts like the exam arc (e.g not showing Hisoka's cards piercing the fake examiner's face, not showing blood when Hisoka wrecked those guys in the mist), but later on when the tone of the story became darker they were able to go all out with it.  <br> girl </br>  <br>Yes, the time slot changed when CA started. Dunno why they didn't have that time slot to begin with.</br>  <br>Those lines were mostly foreshadowing for Gon-san, I assume.</br>  <br>Yeah, i think they did change timeslots during the Yorkshin and Chimera ants arcs. It really becomes obvious when you compare Hisoka's arms getting cut off with sparkles in the Arena and Uvo's scenes.<br>They only changed the CA slot around episode 90 something though, some of the most disturbing scenes were on the morning timeslot.</br></br>  Fuck this author for being a fucking lazy lard ass, and not finishing this.<br>I bet he doesn't have any fucking illness and is just pimping his money out.</br>  <br> Hisoka's arms getting cut off with sparkles <br>To be fair they may have just done that to keep it consistent with the guy's arms being cut off by him in the exam arc.</br></br>  <br> I bet he doesn't have any fucking illness and is just pimping his money out. <br>Didn't he get back surgery earlier this year? He might still be recovering.<br>Also i don't think money's much of an issue for Togashi, YYH made him rich and he's married to Sailor Moon's author.</br></br></br>  <br>Bait thread aside, is this anime really supposed to be good? Looks like some kiddie shit for 12 years old to me.</br>  <br>Yes , i'm not sure , but it seem to me that the timeslot changed .</br>  <br> Looks like some kiddie shit for 12 years old to me. <br>It is</br></br>  <br>Starts light, gets heavier. It's still battle shounen but one of the darker ones.</br>  <br>It would have been a great series if the creatord hadn't sold out to SJWs and made the cute catGIRL a "ambiguous genderfluid".</br>  <br> the guy's arms being cut off by him in the exam arc <br>I wonder if that's the scene that suffered the most from censorship.</br></br>  <br>I honestly think it was fine because it still fit Hisoka's "theme". I really didn't like how they changed the scene of him systematically slitting like 8 dude's throats to him just spinning in a circle and them just falling over though.</br>  <br>It's not anbiguous , HE's definitely an ant , no't a boy or a girl .</br>  Anime 2011 was great for his animation , design and OST ( except opening) , but yes he suffers to the censorship , but it's a constant problem in all anime adaptation .  <br>I'm sure HxH 2030 won't suffer from these problems.</br>  The worst censorship moment , it's when franklin shoot mafia guys , in the anime , his bullets are similar to tennis balls when they touch them .https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2K<wbr>YgtIRDev4</wbr>  [ ]  <br>I want to pound this cute cat girl until I fill every single one of her orifices with my seed.</br>  <br>Now is not the time to sexualize Pitou, anon.</br>  <br>When then?</br>  <br>I forgot how bad it was.

Most adaptations that don't cover the entire source leave the viewer wanting more if they haven't read the source, but to someone who hadn't read the source, HxH's adaptation has an actual ending. Honestly, if you're saying the adaptation isn't good, you're just being an elitist mangafag, or being one of the "AM I FITTING IN YET?" /a/ fags, because if you judge it objectively, it was a far better adaptation than most.</br></br></br>  <br> GA <br> HA </br></br>  <br>I'm not sure if you're describing him correctly, but what you described is a sociopath, not a psychopath, you uneducated, worthless piece of subhuman waste.</br>  <br>oh boy, there's this faggot again</br>  <br>It really isn't, it isn't good on its own. What makes it good is the material it's adapting it however fails to stand on its own.

It is literally over, and it chose the only good place to end it from the source material, it ended.</br>  <br>In and itself its a false statement, because <br>1. people are talking about the quality of the work and your statement actually ignores that.<br><br>2. It didn't really end so much as they just ran out of material to adapt. It's the same as saying that '99 is great not because of the actual quality of the show but because it actually ends.</br></br></br></br>  <br>1. The point I addressed had nothing to do at all with the quality of the work.<br><br>2. 99 was great because it had good direction, but it did NOT have closure the way 2011 does, it ended because it ran out of source material. 2011 also ended because it had no more source material, the difference is that 2011 had a spot to end that actually felt like an ending whereas 99 did not.</br></br></br>  <br> fantastic music placement and timing <br> highest quality animation in a TV anime <br> masterful storyboarding <br> excellent pacing <br> completely faithful; nothing is left out and scenes and characters are presented exactly as the manga <br> improved character designs <br> lively color scheme <br>Are you stupid? It's the best adaptation anyone could ask for.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>made me laugh/10</br>  <br>1. Well that's to bad because that's what people are talking about when they say it doesn't stand on its own. Every adaptation ends, an adaptation ending doesn't mean it stands on its own.<br><br>2. 2011 doesn't really have closure either, it ran out of source material too. Hence why it started introducing the dark continent. That is why your statement is false.<br><br><br> Except the music timing is terrible <br> sure if you like a lot of still shots <br>  source material <br> That's the source material and even then Chimera Ant arc was terribly paced <br> Kite, Kon, Gon's situation with his family, Leorio, and quite a few scenes were actually cut <br> the character designs were terrible <br> That didn't match the tone <br>If you lack taste</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon i'm pretty sure that second post you replied to was ironic</br>  <br>I sincerely hope it was, but I've actually seen people who really believe that shit.</br>  <br>he hates the enemies of people he's on good terms with</br>  <br>probably the best way to put it tbh</br>  <br> That's the source material and even then Chimera Ant arc was terribly paced <br>The pacing in general sucks. Slow start, some well-paced episodes, second half of Yorkshin is rushed, and all of Greed Island is rushed.</br></br>  <br>What makes it worse is that they tended to rush past things that helped build characterization if they didn't skip it entirely.</br>  Enough about bad adaptations<br><br>Here's one that succeeds on its own merits</br></br>  <br>Can I watch this without reading the manga at all?</br>  <br>From what I remember the anime extends parts in the Dark Tournament and removes the last part of the manga. But it's been a while.<br><br>Both are worth it though.</br></br></br>  <br> all he did was kill your shitty waifu. <br>Who did he kill?</br></br>  <br>baro, how i miss her so</br>  How do you feel about Ging?  <br>I found it hilarious how anticlimatic his introduction was, the threads for when he showed up were fun. He also lived up to the hype without him being in any fight which is really satisfying.<br>He's also a pretty good character so far, i like him a lot.</br></br>  <br> Highly flawed while also being likeable and qt <br>I love him</br></br>  <br>I might be going to prison for 7 years so I know that at least when I get out there will be at least 7 more chapters of Berserk and about 40 chapters of HxH. So it's not all bad right?</br>  What I've always wondered is why they had to reboot the series instead of just doing an OVA series for the CA arc. No need to censor a thing.  <br> I might be going to prison for 7 years <br>You should be happy that you didn't get 20, you fucking pedophile cunt. I hope someone releases the word out in the prison that you are there for reading lolicon hentai and the big Tyrone's and Jamal's beat you to a pulp (child molesters are treated like the lowest of the low scum in prisons).</br></br>  <br>If someone hired Killia's dad or brother to kill his aunt. He would murder entire Killua's family</br>  <br> I might be going to prison for 7 years <br>I hope you're one of those Killuafags.</br></br>  <br>what did you do</br>  <br>I know, anon. One glance at the four protagonists and I thought this was Yugioh/Beyblade tier stuff.<br><br>But yeah. It's actually pretty great.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Haha try cult of marijuana ya fucking scumbags but dont worry I'm sure Ill be able to supply everyone with all the cartoon porn they want.</br></br>  <br>See . He goes to prison for being a lolicon.</br>  <br>Let my medical marijuana card expire and then got searched.<br>Everything was siezed at my facility and then my apartment was searched and siezed took over a thousand dollars in cash and close to 300 in medicine.<br>Luckily I have my doctor recomendation from april of this year so im protected under certain statutes to a point but i had more plants than i was legally alllowed to grow.</br></br></br>  <br>Good luck anon. Maybe there'll be a couple of new chapters by the time you're out.</br>  <br>Nobody believes you, lolipedo.</br>  <br>The best part about it is that you'll have a nice amount of chapters to look forward to.</br>  <br><br>That's exactly what I've been thinking.</br></br>  <br>Did they find your child cartoon porn in your computer</br>  TPP, destroying what we love.<br>http://mainichi.jp/select/news/2015<wbr>0728k0000m020060000c.html<br><br>The doujin market can and probably will be threatened by this.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br> In fact, the people voting on it can't even read it. <br>Please, please, please be lying to me about this anon.</br></br>  <br>Even Touhou will get boring if there's nothing else to contrast with it.</br>  <br>Because there is absolutely nothing wrong about the congress selling democracy to the highest bidder.</br>  <br>Companies have hired the military and police in the past <br>The idea of "Mickey Mouse" breaking in your house, killing your dog and fucking your wife is not as crazy as it sounds</br></br>  <br>THE FIGHT ISN'T OVER YET /a/<br><br>DOWNLOAD ALL THE DOUJINS YOU CAN MANAGE, EVERY SINGLE LAST ANON WILL DOWNLOAD ALL THE DOUJINS WE THEY CAN MANAGE<br><br>THEN WE WILL SIMPLY UPLOAD THEM ALL TO A PRIVATE CLOUD SERVICE<br><br>IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT<br><br>THE FIGHT IS NOT OVER, /a/</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Do you enjoy watching anime about little girls crying? What's wrong with you?  They have a habit of photoshopping Hikari into scenes.  <br>reminds me of the dinning scene in Another.<br>Ah.</br></br>  Why is she so perfect?  <br>Maybe it has something to do with the premise or something from her own manga?</br>  <br> Kenshiro + Star wars = Non non biyori </br>  Woohoo! World Trigger!<br><br>I would describe this chapter as "cute".<br><br>Boku no Hero Academia <br>Shokugeki no Souma </br></br></br></br></br>  When Yuuma gets to be cool, he is the coolest.<br><br>It's like all the =3= faces are instantly forgiven.<br><br>Some other things to note: Azuma squad has shown that you can recolor triggers like the bagworm for extra camouflage (white, snow environment). Also, Ninomiya squad's combat bodies wear SUITS. What classy motherfuckers.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cool a fujo bait group <br>Thanks for the dump</br></br>  <br>I really like this spread although it's not really complicated</br>  <br>thanks for the dump</br>  <br>Dude good job.. I was sure you ware gon and i would have to wait more. But your back. God bless you! <br>AND GOD BLESS WORLD TRIGGER!!!</br></br></blockquote>]
