[  super self insert MC <br> lolis everywhere <br><br>What have you been reading, /a/?</br></br></br>  just finished mushuku tensei, and shield bro, reading worm now<br><br>dropped word master after the human king "death-transformation", the retarded conversations were bearable up to that point, why LN dialogue is so shit?</br></br>  <br> Worm <br><br>I keep hearing about it, is it a light hearted story or drama?<br><br>Also, Cthulu Average sidestory was translated recently if anybody missed it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hachi-nan and Tensei Shitara Slime. About to pick something else at random to read from translation lists.</br>  I've been reading that Death March webnovel.  <br><br> Worm <br>I couldn't get past how stupid the main character was and dropped it like 30 chapters in. I figured I'd enjoy it too since Sheeprabbit recommended it.</br></br></br>  <br> Hachi-nan <br><br>Literally never heard of this being mentioned on /a/.</br></br></br>  <br> Zaregoto.  <br>Fuck that MC, fuck him. Holy shit he really should just fucking die. Fucking shit.<br> Bravo nisio, bravo. </br></br></br>  <br>Translation pace for that has been amazing.</br>  <br> lolis everywhere <br>Picked up.</br></br>  <br>drama? its asuper hero story, with a female protagonist and some cool powers, pretty long and its already finished, rate 8.2/10</br>  <br>Really? I thought it was ok, though I've heard it gets kind of ridiculous later.</br>  Altina 8, 9 and Guns and Magic. <br><br>What a waste of time.</br></br>  <br>Glad im not the only one who thinks this. It just got so boring after the timeskip and him arriving in xaos</br>  <br>How is it self insert when MC doesn't give a shit about lolis even though he attracts lolis all the time.<br><br>Pisses me the fuck off. Fuck the author.<br><br>Don't make a loli story and then have an anti lolicon MC.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Death March has more lolis I think. MC pretty much adds one or two lolis to his harem every town he visits while keeping around 4 lolis in his main party.</br>  mahouka vol.12<br><br>because ONII-SAMA</br></br>  <br>wtf is wrong with this guy, is he a high grade loli magnet?</br>  <br> Suzuki, an adult programmer, suddenly notice that he's thrown into another world wearing a casual clothes at level 1. He gained high level and treasures after using the 3-times-disposable-magic, Meteor Shower, once. After that he intend to do another world "sightseeing tours"? <br><br>What the hell does this mean?</br></br></br>  <br>The loli on his lap looks like best girl.</br>  <br>Wordmaster also gets 1 or 2 loli every place he goes. A couple of them are actually lolihags though.</br>  <br>You know what they say, if you see one guy and a fuckton of girls, it means either he's queer or you're getting cucked.</br>  <br>Mia is pretty good. <br><br><br>His  childhood friend / previous life's wife that's a goddess cursed him to attract flat chests.  </br></br></br></br>  <br>It takes place in a world with video game stats. The world gave him a title that makes loli attracted to him.</br>  <br>Really? I read word master up to like chapter 80 and there was only like 2 lolis that were interested in him.</br>  The new gate and Tsuyokute: new saga.<br>Starting Owari no Chronicle because I have a lot of time this month.</br>  <br>Been keeping up with a few random stories on aho-updates listings, but I haven't really been wowed by anything recently.<br><br>I did recently read all that was translated of the Zashiki Warashiki of Intellectual Village. While it has a neat setting, I kind of find the characters flat and the dialogue atrocious. Every single fucking villain monologues their entire fucking plan or how their power works near constantly. I get that with such an intricate setting immersed in old mythology you need to explain some shit, but it's handled so horribly.<br><br>Though it was interesting enough for me to read through all five translated volumes at least.<br><br><br>Worm has its ups and its downs, but it has some of the best use of superpowers I've ever seen in fiction. And the climax of the story is one of the few things I would describe with the word epic despite that word's extreme overuse.<br><br>It is incredibly long so it takes quite a while to get to that payoff though. Also due to being a superhero series, there are a lot of fucking characters. And those are hard to remember and keep track of in such an extremely long story, but surprisingly it manages it well though I guess that's one of the reasons it's so damn long. It's also not shy about killing characters off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The important question is whether he hooks up with the loli or not.<br>Oda Nobuna is probably the worst in that aspect (pervert protag, yet disgusted by lolis), but Black Bullet has the old hag childhood friend winning too.</br></br>  Since an anime is basically confirmed at this point, might as well read up to bitch about secondaries in the threads<br>:^)</br>  <br>Does he have his Lolislayer title yet? I think he starts to pick up more of them after that.</br>  <br>Dude wakes up at level one, realizes he has a spell he can cast three times, and then decides to treat everything as a vacation.</br>  Is the an epub for Death Match besides vol 1?  I've started to read Elvenblood. It's up on the same site of Anti Magic. Overall, it has very high edge content and the story seems pretty predictable right now. On the other hand, it's about killing elves so it's okay.  <br>why /a/ hates elves?</br>  <br> Lolis Bath <br>How amazing that feel ?</br></br>  Anyone read Close Combat Mage? It's fun, but I can't help but think the author totally fucked up after revealing MC can basically bloodbend.  As I Lay Dying and some of Nathaniel Hawthorne's short stories.  <br><br>Funnily enough, while he attracts lolis all the time, he really likes older girls with big tits. <br><br>The hero of the country that Arisa talks about attracts the type of girls the MC likes, while the hero himself likes lolis but only gets women with big tits in his harem.<br><br>They're both cursed to get the opposite of what they want.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Chapter 45 of Tensei Shitara Slime translation just came out.<br><br>Wow Rimuru is about to get a large number of guests to his city.</br></br>  <br>Aren't there like 3 different groups translating this or something?</br>  <br>Not anymore. One group translated 4 chapters, another group translated from there until like chapter 12, then someone else picked it up from there until 18. Clown picked it up and has done up to chapter 45. <br><br>I think there might be another group doing the LN version but they're only at around chapter 10 of the WN storywise.</br></br></br>  <br>What happened to AntiMagic's release schedule.<br><br>The author seemed fast at release volumes before.<br><br>Now we are left with an annoying cliffhanger.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he really likes older girls with big tits. <br>Thanks for protecting me from reading it. Time to stop the dl.</br></br>  <br>I fucking hate how I have to go to three websites with horrendous designs to read this shit</br>  <br>Yeah, I almost dropped it. I don't understand why they can't just put it on that mainsite.</br>  <br>which ones are you talking about w the one with the lolis fanfiction or the black one?</br>  <br><br>You're going to stop reading it because of a preference? At least give it a try, he destined to live a flat chested life for the most part.<br><br>I say for the most part because he's completely smitten by the queen of elves and in future spends a lot of time courting her because he really does love her.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Yeah, it's pretty bad going through those sites but what can we fucking do about it? <br><br>The worst one is the one with the loli dialogue every chapter, it's pretty horrifying what insanity can do.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You're going to stop reading it because of a preference? <br>No, I'm not going to stop, I just protect myself from starting it and face inevitable disappointment and anger.</br></br>  <br>New volume just came out a few months while ago. It takes time for new volumes to come out you know.</br>  <br>Currently waiting on Baccano's only untranslated volume so far that just happens to be right in the middle of the novels.<br>Also waiting on Korean Zombie volume 5 .pdf.</br></br>  <br> Baccano's only untranslated volume so far <br><br>Didn't all fantranslations just die from the license?</br></br></br>  <br><br>But the main woman he likes is a mature elven queen, it's not like he's going to drown lolis forever.</br></br>  <br>Translator updated it this month, so no. He said he might as well complete it since there's only a chapter and half left and then the entire series so far will be fully translated.</br>  <br>I don't mind the loli rambles, I just ignore them.<br><br>I'm just mainly annoyed that there's a main site that seems to serve no purpose except redirect to three other sites. It's a pain.<br><br>Also, I can't believe people voting for that one poll with translating dialogue options. How did natural dialogue translations score the lowest number of votes?<br>Do people really need their handheld to determine who said what?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know what you don't understand here, so I'll say it.<br>I don't want a protag who doesn't like lolis, shames lolis, and ends up with a fucking old hag.</br></br>  <br> protag who doesn't like lolis, shames lolis, <br><br>But he doesn't hate them, rather he's fond of them and works hard to stop himself from spoiling them everyday.<br><br>The only loli that gets scolded is Arisa because she's often trying to seduce him and tease him. And she's  reincarnated so she's like 30-something inside in the body of a loli. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stick with Wordmaster.<br><br> 《Little Girl Killer》 <br> You seem to be an existence that are blessed by, and attracts, little girls. In the eyes of little girls, your charm has suddenly increased. This is surely because you are also a Loli-- </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What else can we do, we are at 155/700 chapters if you want to drop it then godspeed anon, because from what I hear it's just him becoming more and more broken and beating shit up, eating until the ending where he fights a big bad and  dies, but comes back in the end to reunite with the rest of the cast. No one won the wordbowl. </br></br>  <br>That's not really different than Death March though, Hiiro is not attracted to any of the lolis he runs into. He doesn't end up with one either. At least Satou is nice to the lolis plus he's pretty much destined to end up with multiple wives at this point anyway.</br>  <br>how the fuck did he manage to lose having such a game breaking cheat hability?</br>  <br><br>As his fame grows more and more nobles chuck their daughters at him, but he always gets away before getting chained up. Queen of Elves or bust for Satou.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm not reading something where lolis are not taken seriously. That is all. Already deleted.</br></br>  <br>That's my boy.</br>  <br>He'll most likely get Elf Queen, but Arisa, Lulu, and childhood friend girl(fuck can't remember her name at the moment) will probably get in on it too.</br>  <br>Almost banner-tier</br>  <br>Wait what? <br><br>At what volume and chapter do they mention this? <br>Also,  does the childhood friend join him in his travels? </br></br></br></br>  <br>GODDAMIT</br>  <br><br>The only time she shows up so far is in the  flashback chapter about the shrine-maiden. She's the one that gave him the 3 powers when he was transported to the world the novel takes place in. </br></br>  <br>It's one of the intermission chapters that was already translated.  Yes Childhood friend girl joins the party later, she's actually the Hero Yamato that founded the empire or whatever. She originally was going to go back to her world but found out Satou was going to get summoned here in the future through some kind of oracle so instead she entered basically hibernation for 500 years to wait for him. <br><br>It's not her Goddess self though, just normal Satou childhood friend.</br></br> </br>  <br>http://www.sousetsuka.com/2015/06/d<wbr>eath-march-kara-hajimaru-isekai_22.<wbr>html<br><br> "Fuhn nanoja, I hate Satou. I'll put a curse so you'll always be with flat-chests for all your life."</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  Thinking of reading Combat Continent because I had nothing more to read and every fag keeps complaining about the manhua adaptation.<br><br>Also Rokka no Yuusha, but I don't know if I want to spoil myself while the anime is airing, and I don't have enough motivation to start Antimagic Academy, right now.</br></br>  <br> Antimagic Academy <br>Isn't this getting an anime anyways?</br></br>  <br><br>Oh, forgot about those chapters. Kinda just skipped over them, thanks. <br><br> God bless I love childhood friends, thanks. </br></br></br></br>  <br>It's going to be a bad one though, 9 volumes in 2 cour.</br>  <br>It's confirmed they're going to adapt 9 volumes?</br>  <br>Apparently so, I was cautiously optimistic about the anime too.</br>  <br>Mushoku Tensei<br><br> MC marries 3 girls <br> All of them are perfect waifus (Eris &amp; Roxy are best though) <br><br>  <br>Just finished Shieldbro, seems my taste isn't that bad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  After going through Death March, I finally decided to dive into mondaiji-tachi. Reading elvenblood as well, but I instantly go through them whenever kry releases, so mondaiji will have to do. <br><br>Got mahouka on my backlog, but got sao before that. Though after going through the first half of V12, I got really reluctant to go further so kinda put it on hold there.</br></br>  <br><br><br> Antimagic Academy <br><br>I will physically harm you two if you decide that watching the potentially disastrous adaptation is a good choice. Go read the novels, they been translated up to the current volume.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> read </br>  <br><br>Drop SAO after volume 2. You're welcome.</br></br>  <br>Pick up Progressive, both LN and manga versions.</br>  Kansutoppu is pretty fun so far. It's kind of like One-Punch Man with her pulping everything.  <br>Too bad "the lazy 9" aptly deserves their name.</br>  I wish some other group would pick up Magi's Grandson, I really liked how that one was going.  <br>Ryua-chan a cute!</br>  <br> Someone said it gets kind of serious and people start dying everywhere. </br>  Translation never ;_;  <br> I will physically harm you two if you decide that watching the potentially disastrous adaptation is a good choice. Go read the novels, they been translated up to the current volume. <br>In all honestly i think i read the first novel and it was kind of stupid with swords &gt;guns. But i keep hearing it gets boring and sucks in the middle and it being god tier later in the series. Should i hunker down and read through it?</br></br>  <br> swords&gt;guns <br>That's really not in the first volume at all, did you even fucking read it?</br></br>  <br>I read this like years ago man, last thing i remember reading was the guy using a sword or something when the school was being attacked and some magic shit happened with the sword</br>  <br>Did the translators of this ever stop being massive faggots? Because I remember most of them being massive cunts.</br>  <br>It's the best superhero story I've read if you can get past the early bullying and edginess.<br><br>The author is completely clueless when it comes to real world weapons and politics though.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not so light hearted novel.<br><br>Lots of death at the end and MC keep going down the hill with no brake.<br><br>Still it's a good enough read.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This guy just keeps getting cockblocked by those lolis. I gotta feel for him.</br>  <br>I bet this fucking idiot has a script or something that searches for every mention of the word "loli" just to shit up threads.</br>   see Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka? releases on Baka <br> 35 chapters translated? Looks interesting <br> "My English is not that good actually and I can't read Japanese. Learned my Japanese through animes only so don't expect much." <br><br>Why do these people exist?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Hachi-nan <br><br>I used to read it but it's kinda too forceful to me. <br><br>Meet a rare undead dragon? No problem, just blast him with light magic and be done with it.<br><br>I also hate the way the author keep recap everything that has happened. And the magic system is a mess.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to believe they do this with the hopes of improving their skills, and they say this just to warn people.</br>  <br> 1 chapter a month <br><br>Well, the binge was nice while it lasted.</br></br></br>  <br> 1 chapter a month <br>You are going to wish it was that good.</br></br>  <br><br>Alyschu, the group who's doing the manga, is also doing the LN. They're only on the first volume of the LN though. And the LN itself in japan is quite far behind from the WN.</br></br>  <br>Yeah I wasn't sure if they were still working on it or not since I hadn't checked their site other than for the manga.</br>  <br>Kill Elves? What a waste!</br>  <br> The harem stayed as three, no more.  <br><br>Perfect harem in a sense.</br></br></br>  <br> some of the best use of superpowers I've ever seen in fiction <br>Examples? More than one, if you will.</br></br>  <br>Recently picked up Tensei Shitara Slime; I'm enjoying it quite a bit, just wish they had an editor who knew english.<br><br>Aside from that, also reading Death March, Vampire Princess, Manowa, Magi Craft Meister, and some other stuff with longer release periods.<br><br>It's not like I'm intentionally falling into these stories with game mechanics; they're just the ones that get the most translations apparently.</br></br></br></br></br>  RIP Arifureta, you were shit but I liked reading you.  <br>Did japtem drop it?</br>  <br>Endo got busy, last chapter translated was 2 months ago.</br>  <br>It gets better with volume 5. Like Muv Luv Alternative is better than Myv Luv Unlimited. <br><br><br>The guy literally cuts bullets and has an anomalous magical weapon that is a sword and named after Norse and is better than all the other magical weapons which are guns and are named after tyrants (Stalin magical heritage where? )</br></br></br></br>  <br>Japtem has pretty much dropped off the radar.<br>In the last month, they've only released chapters for Shadow Rogue, even though Magi's Grandson is their most liked story at the moment, apparently.<br>It's funny how all their translators are apparently too busy to do anymore, but then they go and announce they'll be doing manhua.</br></br></br>  <br>They're not something that should be spoiled.<br><br>Like I can think of a few fantastic examples, but they're all massive spoilers as well.</br></br></br>  Why are the magic systems in WNs and LNs always so oriented and ranked in terms of their combat utility? Magic artifacts and tools may have practical everyday use but magic cast by people is always about making bigger fireballs or rain of ice shards. <br><br>Surely there are more productive uses for having phenomenal cosmic force at your fingertips. Like in Mickey Mouse in the Magician's Apprentice or in Harry Potter when it's used to make housework easier. Or in Lord of the Rings when Gandalf uses it to make pretty fireworks.</br></br>  <br>Cause the ones you're talking about are based on MMORPGs.<br><br>If you read Mushoku Tensei, there's a ton of utility magic and it's a lot more flexible. It's just about how creative and imaginative you are when it comes to devising new spells.<br><br>But when you're talking about shit based off vidya games? Really? What vidya game do you know has a spell that heats up water for the bath while you take a shit next door?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why are the magic systems in WNs and LNs always so oriented and ranked in terms of their combat utility? <br>Because the story centers around the kind of people who use magic in combat, rather than utility.<br>For some reason, the authors rarely think about adapting that kind of magic outside of combat.<br><br>"So what if it's an RPG World?" is a WN that focuses more on combat, but at the same time the author makes a point about how magic has tons of other applications, like Air-ships and advancing technology.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here's the magic system dilemma. You want a magic system, what will you chose?<br>For a lack of better terms, the RPG system or traditional Witches and Wizards.<br>The RPG system works incredibly well for combat. Elements, circles, runes that can be manipulated and formed into attacks. Its really easy to build upon it and explain how stuff works or is made. Because of its "modularity" it can be expanded in many ways.<br><br>Witches and Wizards on the other hand is all about the mystic. Recite a spell and an action happens. How it happens is not explained. Could be gravity could be any kind of elementary force. It isnt explained at that is this kind of magic's charm.<br><br>You could add gravity or force in the RPG system as elements but then it would degrade into a physics textbook as you find ways to abuse it, not so much shounen now.<br>I could go on but i think this is enough.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mushoku Tensei <br>the only magic I remember is Water Ball, Rainstorm, Earth Bullet, Swamp, Frost Nova, Thunderbolt, Thermonuclear explosion, gravity magic, and that magic cancel spell that I think Magonote forgot all about. Also some healing magics and some barrier stuff we never see. None of these have any place in activities of daily living besides healing. I guess you could argue water ball plus wind could be used for washing and drying clothes but why waste mana when you could just wash them in a basin and dry them in the wind?</br></br>  I've been reading Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku o again since skythewood started translating the third volume, hope he'll pick up the fourth soon. <br><br>Other than that Im reading Hikaru and Rokka no Yuusha while waiting for someone to start translating my guilty pleasure  Hidan no Aria  I know  again.</br></br>  <br><br>Speaking of Mushoku Tensei, I still find myself wondering what exactly you do in magic university. We're given to believe that magic for the vast majority simply requires you to memorize and recite the incantation and this acts like a macro to automate the process of activating a certain set magic routine. And more complex and forceful magics have longer incantations. But nobody understands magic from first principles since nobody knows how to use it unvocalized, and nobody is inventing new spells, and thus all magic is basically empirical. Thus, how could a course at magic university last for five years (or however many years it was)? How much could there possibly be to study, and what could you possibly write your thesis on?</br></br>  <br>You can warm up water with fire magic, water your plants, or produce new soil for it.<br><br>That said, because normal people can't use voiceless, and because magic circles are expensive, using spells is just kinda stiff unless you can be creative in application. Because MT magic is more grounded and is based within several systems and categories, Harry Potter's "self cleaning dishes" wouldn't be possible.<br>On the other hand, most other things are still possible, like how Zanoba created living dolls (or rather, androids?) and that could be used to basically take care of any and all house work.</br></br></br></br>  Best girl or just a useless drunk goddess?  <br>That's a pretty good point—I never thought about it.<br>You clearly have control over the spell after using it, but what then? It's never clear how much control you have over a spell after casting it, and what you'd have to learn to gain better control.<br>Nanahoshi basically said that people in that world don't really work on creating new magic circles, and the same probably applies to voiced spells—and then you have to wonder how they learned those spells to begin with (I know they said they got it from the Elves, but they never explained it)<br><br>It sorta just feels like a plot-hole now.</br></br></br></br></br>  Is there anyone know the name of this LN? It's about a guy who is a chuuninbyou neet and then he got hit by a truck and died. And then he reincarnated into a village girl in a fantasy world and she vow to stop being a chuunin and live a normal life. Until she heard that her little sister claimed herself as one of the Demon's General.  <br>I haven't read it myself, but sounds like Tilea's Worries<br>https://oniichanyamete.wordpress.co<wbr>m/index/tileas-worries/</wbr></br></br>  <br>Yes, that LN. Thanks, m8.</br>  Too lazy to update my list.<br>Right now I recently found Bungaku Shoujo online so I'm reading that.</br>  <br> super self-insert <br>He's heartless as fuck, maybe some apathetic faggots on /a/ can insert into him, I can't.

Read a few (or just one) chapters of it and it seemed pretty good, the writer really got his shit together in them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not to mention they translate like ass and one of them is an obnoxious faggot.</br>  <br> I think that's her name <br>It's almost impossible to forget her name.

I admit that there's some moment when he show compassion for his companion, but he still retain his holier-than-thou attitude which is a big turn off. Otherwise, most of the time he just act like a dick.<br> won't do anything unless there's some value in it most of the time <br>You should check out his value system.<br> If he's feeling generous he'll give them a hint <br>And while you're at it, check out when he feel generous as well.

Hell, in general, little kids seems to like him a lot. He's kinda like that older brother that always says harsh things but is clearly looking out for you in his smug way.

The author has done a good job of making it hard to tell who will win. The translation goes to shit whenever setting exposition begins, so trying making sense of the plot gets annoying, though.</br>  <br>im reading about a story of a guy who was hired to livd in another worlf for 20 years and on his first weeks he got his ass beaten by rabbits in a struggle and then spend a week of spartan training to have revenge on just fucking rabbits.</br>  <br>Same key visual but in higher res</br>  <br>Been reading magicraft meister<br><br>just love crafting SOL type stories</br></br></br>  Im reading something about the MC is the side character and his best friend is the Hero of his own story and gets harem while the MC side character is the bro wingman<br><br>pretty much reverse roles</br></br>  I'm recently been reading Mondaiji-tachi and Campione. Mondaiji has way too much filler but otherwise it's okay. Campione is the worst thing I've ever read.

Nonetheless, he seems used to deal with Empire' stuff now. <br><br>Thinking of reading it whole because I'm Princess Lunas fag<br><br><br>I think so, too. But after reading Shiro Koukoku and seeing how in less than 12 volumes the MC pretty much gets like 10 or more wives, I think Rudeus' harem is not that best  even though I'm Eris and Roxy fag myself <br><br><br>You can do you a favor and drop it now.

It killed him and all those close to him.MC takes in his brother 's wife, has his first time with her (as according to tradition where lil bros fuck their older bros wives to know how sex works) and decided to keep her as a waifu/concubine  </br>  <br>Worm's a fairly dark superhero story. Overall great, but has it's ups and downs.

He's waiting for the next volume to be released, he'll be translating Elvenblood in the mean time.</br>  <br>Yes, also keep in mind it's huge and takes a bit to get going. I think it was stated to be 1.65 million words. You'll also have to mind some teenage drama, but then that goes away and it becomes drama about the meaning of what a hero is and what being a hero should be.<br><br>The scale also only ever really keeps increasing.</br></br></br>  <br>Looking at the About page, it seems like it. Kinda surprised it was a gaijin series since this was mostly a LN discussion thread but seems interesting nonetheless. Just going to be no Japanese tropes we're accustomed to</br>  <br>Think i will directly skip it, not really fond of this superhero books or comics. Hated even the one Sanderson wrote.</br>  <br>Really not as bad as it could be. I'm cautiously optimistic but I'll probably be disappointed. It should be treated like an action show with lulls but it'll probably be treated like a harem romcom with action like every other LN adaptation.</br>  Read regarding slime tensei<br><br> dat chapter 39 <br>god damn I fucking love the MC</br></br></br>  <br>Lot of people wanted more girls in the Mc's harems<br><br>but I would've been mad if they did.</br></br></br>  <br> The author is completely clueless when it comes to real world weapons and politics though. <br>Even the superhero politics outside Brockton Bay fell kind of flat. It was if that city was the center of the universe and everything else didn't really matter.</br></br>  Some really nice english stories are :<br>Mother of Learning<br>A hero's War<br>Lair (royal road)<br>Dungeon without a name (royal road)<br>This onii-chan got summoned to adifferent world (royal road, not as good as the earlier mentioned ones but good enough to spend time if you want a laugh)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Japtem was the best when they were translating LMS and Arc really quickly.

Though how they even came into notice here is hard to figure or say.<br><br><br>Hard to disagree with. It's something very prevalent in the entire genre. Trying to manage political depth in more than one city full of superheroes isn't something I think any superhero series has properly managed.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So basically he's a psychopath.</br>  <br>The eldest one , the one who gets the territory where MC is born.I think 2 other brothers were involved too.</br>  <br>Try these ones too </br>  Reading Long Live Summons and now I'm waiting for a new chapter <br><br>I wish there was other Xianxia series with a similar MC</br></br>  <br>What is this</br>  <br>That's Marisa.</br>  <br> Slime Tensei <br>Slime Tensei is a different story than that one. That one's name is Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken. <br><br><br>The  oldest one that inherited the territory. That other spoiler didn't really cover everything well but basically MC kept getting more and more famous and older brother felt threatened by the fact that his little brother was a hero and dragon slayer and stuff and thought he was trying to steal the territory. The King intentionally basically forced the situation though by making the MC visit his former home on his way to the demon forest for a mission request. The King really wanted that southern area to actually be developed since there was tons of resources and things there but MC's family had basically been turning down offers of assistance apparently. Not entirely sure why but there you go. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No  only the oldest brother was involved in the plot but he was also basically manipulated into it because of some nobles from the capital who wanted to get rid of MC. The other brothers, except for the smart one, were originally jealous of MC too but got over it, they got jobs under MC managing the territory as it rapidly develops now.  </br>  <br>Master of Monsters.</br>  <br>That's why I nicknamed it "Regarding Slime Tensei"<br><br>but really the other is so bad I might as well not even acknowledge its existence.</br></br></br>  <br><br>"Cthulu Average sidestory"<br><br>What I checked and I've seen no suck update. the last one was two months ago.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Trying to manage political depth in more than one city full of superheroes isn't something I think any superhero series has properly managed. <br>Brennus handles it pretty well, has an even worse beginning than Worm but it's ending up really good. It manages to create a pretty decent picture of all the crazy political landscapes that can occur worldwide when you throw supers into the mix while still getting into the lives of it's characters. Stone Burners does a good job too.</br></br>  <br> Cthulu Average <br>What happened with that? I thought the 2nd book was going to get translated but I also heard it's getting a LN that'll revise and continue the story.</br></br>  <br>your level of imagination</br>  <br>Sheeprabbit is working on Bakamille's story again. Not sure what happened with the side stories because I remember Vidar saying he had all the season 1 side stories done and was waiting for Sheeprabbit to finish season 1 to post them but then nothing.</br>  <br><br><br> cthulu <br> falling for the google translate meme <br>why cant you retards just call it jashin average<br>or at least call it evil god average</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> missing all the puns we made in the old threads </br>  <br>First chapters never ;_;</br>  <br><br>Is spider girl best girl?<br><br>Please say yes.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128173304 <br>No. Slime waifu is best girl.Altrough used goods.</br>  <br>Thanks for the spoiler. Also, what's going on in that pic? Is she a princess of sorts? Is he gonna add her to his harem?<br><br> also, when can I expect the pace to pick up? Translations are at chapter 28 as far as I know. </br></br></br>  <br>   also, when can I expect the pace to pick up? Translations are at chapter 28 as far as I know. <br> She is archipriest's daughter. He was joking about how she was getting many proposals and MC joked about joining in the queque so he ended up being forced to take her as main waifu since she has highest status amont the present harem members.She is the specialized healer of the party  </br></br>  <br>what?</br>  <br>She's  the Cardinal's granddaughter. She's actually the legal main wife as it were because of her high standing. When MC visits the church for the baptism thing, he gets in a conversation with the Cardinal and Cardinal mentions how his granddaughter is receiving a ton of marriage proposals. MC jokingly says maybe he should also offer a proposal and the Cardinal takes him at his word and makes it official that they're engaged. Cardinal knows that a mage as strong as MC will go really far politically. <br><br>Also translation pace is one chapter a week, are you still looking at the old site?</br></br></br>  <br>Currently reading Tensei Shitara Slime, Death March, Wordmaster, Slave Harem Labyrinth.<br><br>Any other LN/WN with world building, inventing or crafting, Level-up, just the MC being chill?</br></br></br>  <br>Well crafting would be Magi-Craft Meister. There's like 40 or so chapters of that translated.</br>  <br><br>Thanks again. Where am I supposed to read new chapters? I've been following infinitenoveltranslations thus far. I found another wordpress but all those chapters seem really messy despite being "edited" and "proofread" so I'm not so eager in reading those.</br></br>  <br>Only Sense Online is about comfy MMO crafting and MMO store managing.</br>  <br>Oh well, might as well read it too.<br><br>Talking about used goods, I thought that (pic related) was truly about used goods, but it wasn't.

RIP Black Sun. Pretty emotional ending for a character that only spoke once.    <br> BC that's the way it has been referred to in this thread? Seriously who cares as long as you know what we are talking about.</br>  <br>It's in a shitty arc right now, honestly all the dungeon - combat related parts are kind of shitty. The traveling around part are great. There's a better part after the first dungeon part.</br>  <br>Were you using MTL to read those parts?</br>  <br>Not him but personally i really hate having a summoner and discovering she chooses kung fu as second class. I really want some more magicians MCs.</br>  <br>lets put it like this. person who controls bugs versus guy who turns into giant fire breathing dragon, who wins? the answer may surprise you.</br>  <br>I just think that summoning will only be really used against hundreds of enemies. I would like to see her using something like an army of summoned minions to fight, but kung fu against one is cool too.</br>  <br>Bug user of course. There are many ways you can defeat a dragon with bugs, like making them enter from his giant anus. That is as long as you can control them from far away.</br>  <br>strangely enough that does sound like something the MC would do to win a fight. that girl is scary ruthless.</br>  <br> Reincarnated as main character little sister and....i just don't wanna die again <br>What the<br><br>Tell me more about this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I only read the start of the series before getting bored with how stupid it was but didn't the dragon win? MC only survived because other people intervened.</br>  <br>MC is reincarnated as a qt beast girl and is the sister of the MC of a game. She isn't allowed to train cause she has "weak health"(stupid MC tries to use magic when his race exponentially increases mp use so he faints for overuse) so she has to train in secret .She is trying hard to train in secret cause when she will hit 14 years old she will be kidnapped and then die in a fire. <br> She gets kidnapped aniway, ends up with a trap demon yandere falling in love with her.  </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128176265 <br> wanting used goods <br> wanting a delinquent <br> not wanting a qt yamato nadeshiko <br>Shame on you /a/non.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's there to cover for weaknesses. She can't instant cast the stronger ones so they're useless in battle unless if pre-casted. Her main instant ones (knight) becomes useless when they count as spirits and her opponent has some sort of aura that repels/melts nearby spirits.</br>  <br>Can't she just keep them on? She kept the knight on for the whole time.</br>  <br>if I remember right she at least fucked him up pretty bad and made his dick rot off.</br>  <br>Haven't there been a lot of magician MCs lately in LNs, with MT and Wordmaster being notable cases? <br><br>Don't be greedy, us "psst nothing personnel kid" rogue/assassin lovers get absolutely fucking nothing. I just want for once a MC who uses subterfuge, poison and his wit to defeat enemies.</br></br></br>  <br>No idea, might be mana or some other reason. Her strongest summons are big beasts that don't work well if you're going to fight someone in caves or a castle corridor.</br>  <br><br>Also, a different WN with a similar title is being updated on the same page, causing more confusion.</br></br>  <br>That'd actually require clever writing. Something that's too difficult for the authors.</br>  Toki no Shoushitsu Ukeoinin<br>Kuro no Tantei<br>Green worldz<br>Sentou Hakai Gakuen Dangerosu<br>Last two im caught up on and only on chapter two on the others</br></br></br></br>  <br>There was one where MC's weapon was a dagger and the story was quite nice with him being the guard of one of the former gods. I wonder when will tranlations restart. As for wordmaster the WN is a literal mess.</br>  <br>Yeah she fucked him up but she was still about get killed until other people intervened, I don't call that winning.</br>  <br>This isn't a manga thread dumbass.</br>  <br>it makes sense in that setting.<br>summoners have to be strong enough to solo fight the things they want to summon.<br><br>so being a weakling that only relies on summons means you cant get any stronger things to summon.</br></br></br></br>  So Slime Tensei, LN or WN?<br><br>WN is more far ahead, but I expect LN to have better writing..right?</br></br>  <br><br>https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/<wbr>index.php?title=Samayou_Shinki_no_D<wbr>uelist<br>Found it for you. Read this one it is quite good-</br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I'm enjoying Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka? a lot despite that.</br></br>  <br><br>sketchytranslations <br><br>Tokage no Ou and Sasami-san Ganbaranai's translator went MIA 2 years ago.</br></br></br></br>  <br>By the way, how are the translations for that one?</br>  <br>Is Slime Tensei even being worked on anymore? Also I don't think it has a LN.</br>  <br>sasami is still being translated, or are you talking about another translater.</br>  <br>It is another one, "regarding slime tensei" both WN LN are being translated.</br>  <br>Thanks anon. At this point I'm so desperate that a MC with a knife is rogue enough for me.  It's not machine translated right? </br>  <br>So you are talking about Tensei Shitara Slime. Slime Tensei is a different series' name. <br><br>Just read both the WN and LN translations.</br></br></br>  <br>Camille's magical ISIS excursion.</br>  <br>He doesn't use a knife except for a very small part of volume 2. Also the series is dead at volume 2. No more volumes.</br>  <br>"What have you've been reading,/a/?"</br>  <br>Welp, maybe I'll wait a bit before reading it after all.</br>  <br>Yeah it's pretty good, too bad it's dead. Loved how everything got flipped at the end of volume 1.</br>  <br>Antimagic is terrible. Author has no idea how weapons work and the MC is full blown retarded, e.g. MC never trains with his magic sword. He'll never question anything somebody says to him, except the most suspicious and obvious lies. <br><br>Such a gullible MC is ridiculous given his background.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, a character can't be more intelligent than the author anyway.</br>  <br>For something written on a dare it's a pretty fun timewaster.</br>  <br> MC never trains with his magic sword. <br>Because using the sword at all is risky as hell.</br></br>  <br> &gt;For something written on a dare <br>Explain further.</br></br>  <br>MC is too moralfag to me.<br><br>He should have sliced that faggot's stomach considering that faggot harmed his life and family much more than that witch did considering said faggot unleashed an apocalyptic horror on an entire city by being a super edgemaster.</br></br></br>  <br>She fought him again later. And won.</br>  Man, the King in Wordmaster was such an asshole. Fuck him.  <br>Is he worse than the one in Shield Hero?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>She's useful. It's just that it's completely outweighed by her general incompetence and stupidity.</br>  <br>Haven't read Shield Hero yet.<br><br>The Demon race, Evila, recently had a revolution where they overthrew their King that was basically trying to kill everyone. They then started to try and send peace treaties out.<br><br>Wordmaster's King basically gets two of his daughters killed trying to summon Heroes to fight the Evila. He does this while surpressing all knowledge about the Evila's revolution and peace treaties.<br><br>Then he lies to the summoned heroes about basically everything.<br><br>He goes to a peace treaty with the Evila and betrays them. He also betrays all the humans who trusted that this was actually a peace treaty, I guess.<br><br>He sends the Heroes along with a bunch of other people to go slaughter some Evila civilians, and gave the Heroes basically no situational training so they could get themselves killed as an excuse to wipe out the Evila.<br><br>He does all of that for "revenge" for the Evila "killing" his daughters. He breaks the peace treaty and totally fucks the Evila over, because they can't be trusted.<br><br>Which is a really dick move because he goes and trusts some Evila that were claiming to be traitors, which they were, to do all of this, right when he first got notice of the peace treaty.<br><br>Basically, the king is trying to fuck everyone over because he got his daughters killed for no good reason, and can't accept responsibility for it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://oniichanyamete.wordpress.co<wbr>m/2015/07/15/somebody-translated-eg<wbr>a-side-story-6/</wbr></wbr></br>  Is there a hero as weak and unfortunate as Kazuma?

If I can get two or three people to read it I am happy.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I started reading it before it catch on at 4chan, up to chapter 30something I believe, but god, was it stupid? <br> The politics were bad enough it was notorious the author never stepped out of home. The main character was a cynical, nihilist and imbecile with a bullshit power that always won and was somehow better person that others simply because the story went out of its way to point that out.<br> Really, screw it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Please man, the guy is basically always right. He is a walking strawman argument that never loses his cool and always wins easily. He is the typical self insert of the author and his points of view.</br></br>  <br><br>On the subject of good stuff that will NEVER get nearly as much attention as crappy "teleported/reincarnated to magic land" novels; Anybody reading pic related? I am hype somebody actually updated the Baka Tsuki page with three new chapters, but it is going at a crawl regardless. <br><br> Mushoku Tensei is great novel, even if the reincarnation gig is already overused by now </br></br></br></br>  Reading third time in another world<br><br> become girl <br> enslave loli <br> enslave demon lord <br><br>living the dream</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I heard the same, but the starting was pretty decent regardless. The protagonist overpowered nature is getting out of hand quickly, though.</br></br>  <br>It'll never get as much attention because the translations are slow as fuck<br><br>remember Tate hero and Mushoku Tensei were popular because the translators just dished out the chapters.</br></br></br>  <br>Well reading spoilers says that  despite being super overpowered as a mage and even his party becoming super overpowered too, he's getting stuck taking construction and land development type requests and not actual monster hunt ones anymore. <br><br>Plus I think as of most recent chapters all his wives are pregnant now. Which I find a bit of a stretch since they've been having sex at multiple times a week for years at this point. You'd think one of them would have gotten pregnant sooner and not 4 of them at once. </br></br> </br>  <br>Mar 04, 2015 - Volume 3 Chapters 1-2 completed<br>Apr 07, 2014 - Volume 3 Prologue completed<br>Mar 02, 2014 - Volume 2 Chapter 7 completed<br>Mar 02, 2014 - Volume 2 Chapter 6 completed<br>Mar 02, 2014 - Volume 1 Epilogue completed<br>Feb 24, 2014 - Volume 1 Chapter 7 completed<br>Jan 24, 2014 - Volume 2 Chapter 5 completed<br>Nov 25, 2013 - Volume 2 Chapter 4 completed<br>Oct 20, 2013 - Volume 1 Chapter 6 completed<br>Oct 19, 2013 - Volume 2 Chapter 3 completed<br>Sep 13, 2013 - Volume 2 Chapter 2 completed<br>Aug 21, 2013 - Volume 1 Chapter 5 completed<br>Aug 17, 2013 - Volume 2 Chapter 1 completed<br>Jun 28, 2013 - Volume 1 Chapter 4 completed<br>Apr 24, 2013 - Volume 1 Chapter 3 completed<br>Mar 14, 2013 - Volume 1 Chapter 2 completed<br>Feb 12, 2013 - Volume 1 Chapter 1 completed<br>Jan 24, 2013 - Volume 1 Prologue completed<br>Jan 24, 2013 - Initiated as Teaser Project<br><br>Precedent translator :<br> I'm currently working on Rakuin no Monshou and intend to finish it through. <br><br> As I'm relatively new in this I won't be working on any other projects for a while yet. <br> But that'll probably change in the future. <br><br> intend to finish it <br> intend to finish it <br> intend to finish it <br> intend to finish it <br><br>Current translator :<br> I'm new at translating <br><br>And 4 months later, still no new chapter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Besides being so rich that the country he works for can't pay him back and has to pay him back in installments for the next 20 years <br>being married to the Cardinal's granddaughter and numerous mistresses who are all pregnant<br>being given a large amount of land to develop because no other than MC can do it, due to it being the home of monsters normal people can't fight<br>Having the most MP out of all of humanity and generally being broken as all hell<br><br>The fucker actively tries not to get anymore women shoved into his hands anymore because he has too many as it is.

She gets jealous/angry when girls give Rimuru attention. <br/> </br>  <br>A small correction but he doesn't have a sex drive to begin with. He has no gender after all.</br>  <br>Exactly, I can't even call that eccentric behavior that's just fucking retarded.</br>  <br>http://circustranslations.com/chapt<wbr>er-list/<br>Manga and LN are also being translated but this is the farthest along. Manga might serve as a better intro though.</br></wbr></br>  <br> Check it <br>Oh look today's update.</br></br>  <br>Fuckin hell that's hilarious.</br>  <br>i have already read the manga up to date, from which chapter can i read the ln?</br>  <br>Not sure. I'd just read from the beginning and skim, the WN moves really fast. LN translations are kind of slow, I'm not sure how far along they are.</br>  How is Kuro no Maou?<br><br>translator give the description that it's full of suffering and lolis. Lolis are ok but the suffering description makes me hesitant.</br></br>  <br>Why can't i find the translation? <br> Is no one doing it? </br></br>  <br>seems the manga went up to chapter 11 when the MC goes to the Dwarf kingdom. <br><br>though I suggest just reading from the beginning.</br></br></br>  Wordmaster 155 is up.<br><br>And on that note, sites that use odd fonts are hell.</br></br>  <br><br>It's going by very slowly, they've done 74 chapters and the only thing the main character has done is learn some new tricks and make ice popsicles, no seriously. <br><br>The story has edgy parts every now and then before it gets thrown in more SoL segments.  The main heroine is a half-fairy that is a loli and a total yandere when she transforms into an adult. <br><br>No crazy bullshit powerups, luck in finding super rare weapons or gear, no fast paced movement as the MC grows stronger and builds up a harem. This story takes powering up very slowly as in very slowly compared to normal novels.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's been up for a while you know? It's a pain in the ass, but at least it has Kuro no Maou as a side dish.</br></br>  <br>Oh. Well, that's what I get from being 100% reliant on Aho-Updates.</br>  <br> The main heroine is a half-fairy that is a loli <br>Picked<br>  she transforms into an adult. <br>Dropped.</br></br></br></br>  I miss the Mushoku Tensei threads where moon people will post untranslated WNs they are enjoying.<br><br>The only series that's not being translated that I'm still hype for is a series called Dream Life.</br></br>  <br> I keep hearing about it, is it a light hearted story or drama? <br>Angsty dramafest<br><br>Seriously fuck that shit, it's relatively well written but doesn't deserve the hype it got. Wormfags took everything too seriously.</br></br></br></br>  <br> She only does it when she goes full yandere mode. <br>Also, her adult form is only like 13 years old. She only went full adult once </br></br>  <br> I miss the Mushoku Tensei <br>I'm glad that these threads died.</br></br>  I kind of hate ethical translators. Going to be annoyed if Clown stops translating Tensei Shitara Slime because the author tells them the translation is bad because she contacted them asking if it was ok.  <br>they did get pretty stale <br><br>but I still liked that part of it (though it was also a feature of Tate and Overlord threads).</br></br></br>  <br>was kinda disapointed when he got his sexless human form, so no harem or romance possible</br>  <br>FUCKING D R O P P E D<br><br>And here I was enjoying it, thanks !</br></br></br>  <br>Well harem is technically possible, just not a harem that gets any action. He already has Shuna and Shion.</br>  <br> The demon lord will be a part of his harem <br> the great sage ability is also a part of the harem <br><br>basically he's like Ainz from Overlord several females are after him but it's not like he has the means to give the D</br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean, if Rimiru really wanted to, he could have given them the D (except Sage-chan), he just has no drive to do so.<br>From what I hear, the same applies to OverLord's Ainz.</br></br>  <br> good stuff <br>You mean, MC being a genius manipulator and strategist despite spending majority of his life as slave gladiator? Yeah, he did read some books and shit, but this is still stretching it</br></br>  <br><br> Yes, and the novel goes out its way to say he is better than the other people summoned, plus everyone else. He is basically a dick, loved by everyone, certifiably the most talented person, has the moral higher ground over all other humans, and "good" despite not having show a decent side even once so far.<br><br> It's shit man.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I meant attention from translators, and Musho and Tate started slow and catched the attention the right people. Of course once the chapters start rolling more people will be interested, but I wonder why more and more "Tensei" novels get a translator that actually works on them, and this never does.</br></br>  <br><br> Genius manipulator? He seems like an average person, talented in fighting, not bad a strategist, but nowhere near "best" at anything else.<br> The build up the character went beyond "this kid has talent", he learned strategies as a "criminal" boss of sorts, and learned to fight on the arena, but even now his greatest weapon is not "he is the best" but rather "nobody expects nothing from him" and "he has the right crew, with enough experience to back him up".<br> There is great contrast with other characters on the novels, and all around I can't see him as super-smart or anything.</br></br></br></br>  Anyone here read Altina?<br>If yes then how is it?</br>  <br>Most Tensei are WN, most of these "translations" are just edited MTL.</br>  <br>It's not good but it's not bad either. Regis seems to win every battle because he read about them in books.</br>  <br>I can't count how many times I've seen that same damn "dig a tunnel under the enemy base" strategy.</br>  <br> defeated hero of another country, despite being inferior in experience and ability <br> somehow managed an extensive and effective network of spy in few months <br> manipulated bunch of royal-hating slaves into his own personal loyal army <br> can read most people's intention and goad them to give what he want smoothly <br><br>All this while maintaining the facade of useless price in 3 volumes, the princess on the other hand is more useless than a sack of wet sand despite being touted having trained since she's a toddler by her grandpa, a former king and and full pledge general</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Granted, that's probably it. Should had expected as much. Kind of sucks though.</br></br>  <br>So is it focus more on battles<br><br><br>is there romance or some shit?</br></br></br></br>  Despite hearing that Magi's Grandson turns all serious later on in the story, I really wish someone would pick it up because fuck japtem for making empty promises. fucking incompetent fucks.  <br>There are some teases here and there, but MC is typical dense harem MC, so you can expect how it goes.<br><br>Funny thing, side character like the 3rd Prince has more romance than MC</br></br></br>  <br>I might have enjoyed it more if I weren't reading Alderamin, them strategies in Altina were so uninspired and enemies didn't seem to pose any threat at all. I'm just reading on to see if the main villain wins,  and I think he already did. Altina wouldn't be a good ruler anyway. <br><br><br> A few girls fall for MC, but none of them were pursued because of constant wars. An important side character gets his dream girl though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've been reading some xianxia stuff lately, Coiling Dragon, Ni Tian Xie Shan, etc. I mean, it's utter shit from a literary perspective, worse than LNs and LNs are bad enough already, but it's mindless stupid shonen fun, so it's good as just something to do.</br>  Looks like Astarte's Knight translator is working on it again. Finally got chapter 6.  <br> Alderamin <br><br>isn't that the series where  the main heroine dies? </br></br></br>  <br>It also helps that xianxia stuff have translation speeds much faster then you're typical Japanese LN.</br>  <br>wish Lazy 9 translated more Harassing Thief Girl</br>  <br>Well it does turn very bloody when the war started against the magic race. Initially it was very SOL with MC and his one true waifu being a baka couple(good thing the MC confessed before the war started) There are shit like a nobles son trying to ntr him but only angered the mc and his OP grandparents. My case on it is how overpowered the mc because magic is imagination in the series. Still love it when MC goes full rage on faggots trying to hurt his one true waifu<br><br><br>Also i like the ln art</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I honestly didn't saw it as unbelievable. Stuff just rolled with him, his decisions were on the spot, but mostly he doesn't dirty his hands and that's all he needed to keep the facade of a loser.<br> defeated hero of another country, despite being inferior in experience and ability <br>He cheated. On another novel you would see the Hero going up one on one and beating the Other Hero even though the opponent would pull some dirty shit, here he was sly and took advantage of the princess for the kill. <br> somehow managed an extensive and effective network of spy in few months <br>and<br> manipulated bunch of royal-hating slaves into his own personal loyal army <br> It's nowhere near what you are calling it, but again stuff just rolling into place. The loyal army, and spies for the matter, are people he knew well enough thanks to the arena, and the joke is that he is a "Prince and Pauper" that's both prince and pauper. On the book the Prince become beloved and respected because he learned what the people truly went through while being a pauper, here the MC knows the people because he is the people. Some of those obsessed with freedom from their life as slaves become servants to him out of thankfulness, <br><br> can read most people's intention and goad them to give what he want smoothly <br>Now that's clearly not truth. The situation for him could be several times better than what it is if he managed to know the guy who got him at the power can't let people know he is a fake. If he truly knew better his position would be unbelievable solid, and he clearly is not good with interactions beyond scheming for revenge.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. That LN doesn't hold anything back.</br>  <br>They also get like 80$ a chapter or something, don't they? Holy shit, the donations bar at Coiling Dragon seems to be full everytime I looked at it.</br>  <br>Because the translators are chinks in the first place so does it really surprise you that chinks are better at translating chink novels than jap novels?</br>  <br> There are shit like a nobles son trying to ntr him but only angered the mc and his OP grandparents. <br><br>nevermind the OPMC. isn't the grandparents loved by all. Why would people in that country even try to fuck with him?</br></br></br>  <br>It also helps so you don't see translators dropping series.</br>  <br><br>So is the harem thing bearable or does the MC at least have balls.</br></br>  <br> &gt;I've been reading some xianxia stuff lately <br>Shit tast-<br><br> I mean, it's utter shit from a literary perspective, worse than LNs and LNs are bad enough already, <br>At least you're not claiming that they are good. You're alright in my book.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, a couple months back Ren was making nearly (and sometimes above) $300 a day just from translation sponsoring. That's some lucrative shit.</br>  <br><br> Ren, the guy from CD, got so much money he no longers take it. The bar now fills when people donate for other works.<br> Taking in considerations the ads, giving the massive transit and how much people love the guy enough to disable their AddsBlock, and how much he made a day when he translated 3 chapters a day for 80 bucks a chapter, he must above 100k with this stuff.</br></br></br>  <br> functional six figure salary from translating someone's chinese power fantasy on the internet <br>what</br></br>  <br>Because stupid cunt didnt know his place<br><br>Seriously the grandparents are the best and worst at the same. Fucking shipper fags grandpa and grandmas is dangerous.</br></br></br>  <br>Bearable since it happens in tiny doses. MC doesn't have balls and he's all 'muh books' and staying up all night reading books.</br>  <br>I want more One-Punch Girl. TL speed was quick back in like March, then completely dropped off.</br>  <br> That's some lucrative shit. <br>Why am I laughing at this sentence?</br></br>  <br>Don't forget to hate on the author and publishers for being jews that don't know business.</br>  <br>Okay one last question<br><br>does the red head girl fall for him? Also does she smack his head once in a while for not having any balls?</br></br></br>  <br>Why the fuck would you contact the author, that makes no sense.</br>  <br> yes </br>  <br>He also have a normal job on top of that.</br>  <br><br>MC and FeMC is basically genderflipped of traditional roles, so while FeMC is brash, quick to action and charismatic, MC is indecisive, easily pulled along and flustered<br><br>There are some teases between them, MC/FeMC being mild jelly when other characters hitting their counterpart,  holding hands after a duel , FeMC princess carry MC, but none has come to fruitation and it's rather doubtful it will considering their vast differences in position.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hating the author for something like that is silly.</br>  <br>It helps to boost self esteem</br>  <br>Altina and Regis will be that couple that everyone acknowledges and knows is going on but Altina will probably have an "official spouse" on the side that is just for appearances.</br>  <br><br> I don't think it is so much about a main character being capable, but rather about how it is handled. The MC here doesn't pull his abilities out of his ass and get beaten often. Plus he had a rough upbringing and still isn't a nihilistic fuck that curses humanity all the time thinking himself above that, something that I like to see on character. Flaws, believable motivations and mistakes, being unaware of stuff going on, etc. It's the kind of stuff you never see, or almost never see at least, on the WN that had gotten so popular.</br></br>  Reading through ZnT in hope that they release the planned final novel some time in my lifetime.  Elf breast girl . Also tried watching the anime but I can feel it being a slog. I hate how older anime feel so outdated to me but novels that are even older seem timeless.  Why is NanoDesu so damn slow with their .pdfs? I swear some volumes there have been translated for half a year now and no .pdf yet.  <br><br><br><br>Does she get the D ? Important question here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really, because the author is making a mistake based on a misconception of how business works, kinda like the retards who shoved DRM in games non stop.<br><br>On the other hand, the translator has no obligation to do anything at all nor act in a way you want.</br></br></br>  <br>It's cute girl playing a VMMORPG, not a romance</br>  <br>author is dead dude<br><br>give it up</br></br></br>  <br>i see. Thanks for anwering my questions.</br>  <br>They made an announcement recently that someone would use the notes to write the finish, I think.</br>  <br>Did you miss the news? They announced they're having someone else write it to finish it.</br>  <br>While channeling the author's spirit, I hope</br>  <br>the ZnT anime is the reason why I don't want a Mushoku Tensei anime.<br><br>A MT anime adaption just screams "generic harem series"</br></br></br>  <br><br>my apologies<br><br><br>hopefully</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Wasn't the series pretty close to finished anyway?</br></br>  <br>Yeah, pretty sure most people just want to know who won though.</br>  <br>Isn't it pretty much obvious anyway?</br>  <br>Some people are really that delusional. There also has been some big upsets/dark horses wining before. TWOGKs being a good example.</br>  <br>Yeah, the author wrote as much as he could and died with only one or two left. I didn't even like the series, but his "I don't want to die" hit me hard.</br>  <br>what would you prefer?</br>  <br>more like rotten horses<br><br>Reading I Shall Seal the Heavens, damnit how satisfying the last chapter out is</br></br></br>  <br>I keep hearing about this series but its not translated is it?</br>  <br> I Shall Seal the Heavens <br>What happened?</br></br>  <br>https://www.mangaupdates.com/series<wbr>.html?id=113541</wbr></br>  <br>I don't have it.</br>  <br>character dev, and in a very good way.</br>  <br>I'm kind of sad that he ended up like the other Xinaxia MCs, but I guess that's just inevitable in the kind of world they live in.</br>  <br>what did you expect?</br>  <br>Good development.</br>  <br>Yeah, author said he had two volumes more to go before ZnT novels were finished on twitter but then he ended up dying.</br>  <br>Muh nigga.</br>  <br>Now I am sad again.</br>  <br>Did scholar bro become edgy?</br>  <br>Yeah.</br>  <br><br>I was told on /a/ that the anime end more or less the way the author wanted the novels to end, and he had them do that because he knew he wouldn't live to write the ending in the novels.</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't use the term edgy.</br>  <br> He got killed and revived, and has now decided to kill off any weaker people bothering him before their stronger allies show up and kill him again. </br>  <br>Not really, he was attacked by three faggot, he fought, won and let them left alive. They ended coming back with elders faggot and other people. He was 1 v 7, he used his brain and reduced it to 1v4 and won closely vs the last one, ofc he killed him this time and swore to never make this mistake again.<br><br>He's been "good" for 65 chapter now, it was time for him to wake up.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This does make sense considering everyone else in these settings are assholes.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, he tried very hard to not fall in the same setting but he had no choice at this point, the whole continent want his head on a spike</br>    <br> considering everyone else in these settings are assholes. <br>That's the worst part of the genre.</br></br>  <br>Kuro no Maou is the next level of asshole setting if you are interested. Also,  yandere  main girl is a huge bonus.</br>  <br>Long Live Summons has been pretty fun and light hearted so far. I'll be sad to see if it goes like the others.</br>  <br>Yeah, it does get kind of annoying when people fuck with the MC, get there asses kicked and then seek revenge like it wasn't their fault to begin with.</br>  <br>Not interested.</br>  <br>it's a genre where no one wants to take shit from anyone. <br><br>so if you offend "ancient Chinese kung-fu master" he's just going to kill you off, no questions asked.</br></br></br>  <br>Yandere main girls are great, really enjoying the childhood friend hero one too. I think the translator for that one is taking a break at the moment though.</br>  <br>Such pleb taste.</br>  <br>is it the cunt that got told off by the prince in the early chapters? I hope someone would 'steal' this project just like that guy who is doing Isekai Mahou. Although he releases the chapter irregularly.</br>  <br>right now LLS hasn't shown any actual fight scenes yet, so only time will tell. <br><br>Even then that world was being an ass to his past life and the emperor did put a bounty on his head.</br></br></br>  <br>watch your language</br>  <br>Isekai Mahou? He usually puts out a release once a week. That's not really irregular. <br><br>I really wish some other group would pick up MG though. Or Japtem release their shit. According to their "progress" chart they have like 8 chapters translated right now to be proofread and checked.</br></br></br>  OreDungeon seemed like it was going to be pretty good.<br>Then the author rebooted it.<br>Then the author's account was apparently deleted.</br></br>  <br>Why don't you step up and do it?</br>  <br>by irregular, I mean not having a fixed schedule but, he does translate it rather fast, considering the amount of text.</br>  <br>So much for being a dungeon</br>  <br>Being a dungeon?</br>  <br>They quality of it is pretty good too, the other guy barely even knows jap and it was unreadable before edits</br>  <br>meant for </br>  I just caught up with Ark, it's pretty good. It also reminds me of how utterly terrible Zhan Long is.  <br>Who needs reminding?</br>  <br>I want to forget it.</br>  <br>But you can't.</br>  <br>There are translations out there that are as bad and worse, but I agree with you. anyhow, now that we're getting good quality and relatively fast translations for it, I'm very satisfied about it.<br>anyhow, just started reading kuro no maou.

Excluding Nachuyachumi?</br>  <br>They're called Nachuyachumi+ I believe. But shh, keep it a secret.</br>    <br>Yeah, I downloaded something recently, but haven't watched it.<br>It's an hour long. Is the first OVA an hour long, or is that both of them in one file? Because OVAs are usually like 10-30 minutes.</br></br>  <br>There's just one out at the moment.</br>  <br>That's one hell of an OVA.</br>  <br>s'alright</br>  <br>Watch it, anon.</br>  <br>T-thanks now it just looks like  she ripped out her eyes instead of gouging them out </br>    <br><br> Tittymonster </br></br>  <br>Sakurako a perfect.</br>  <br>Sakurako is so perflat</br>  <br>That's her name. Are you really going to claim that isn't her real name?</br>  <br><br>It's a crime to display those little butts.</br></br>    <br><br>This was so unnecessary. I remember facepalming hard when I first watched it.</br></br>  <br>The real crime would be not displaying Yuru butts.</br>  <br>a-are you okay?</br>  <br> This was so unnecessary. <br> facepalming <br><br>Remind me again, did we call 2010 and ask for their faggots?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ayano's pajamas accentuated her figure so much.</br>  <br>Seemed par for the course. I think sexual fanservice is boring, I just didn't focus on it.</br>  <br>What you say..?</br>  <br>I agree completely.</br>  <br><br>Do you guys possibly prefer dicks in your mouth, perchance?</br></br>  <br>You gay, son</br>  <br>Seeing it as sexual is your own problem. I thought it was a breath of fresh air seeing a bath scene where the characters aren't wearing towels for no reason.</br>  <br><br>I must claim responsibility for the thread's death. I killed it with my terrible Ayano pun. I'm so sorry. I feel so bad Baghdad.</br></br>  <br>p-please stop trying, you're literally worse than Kyouko</br>  <br><br> i didn't get this reaction when i made my flavour pun a few threads ago <br>does this mean i'm funny?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh stop it, Yui. You laughed, we all know it.</br></br>  <br>When they were in the hot tub it was fine, showing them standing around barely covered was unnecessary. The anime also had scenes like this and I didn't mind it because the focus was on something else. Even Chinatsu looking at Yui's back was about Chinatsu rather than Yui. <br>Although Akari having problems both times was funny. The bonk on the head sounded painful.</br></br>  <br>They didn't do the dirty kind of disgusting ecchi, just showed us the girls glorious little body to appreciate it.<br>If you can't, that's your problem.</br></br>  <br>Can't remember sorry<br><br><br> pic related </br></br></br></br>  <br> showing them standing around barely covered was unnecessary. <br>Being in that state of undress is actually pretty necessary for a bathhouse.<br>Excessive steam covering them from the shoulders down, or wearing a towel everywhere even though they're all friends hanging out at a bath would be unnecessary.</br></br></br>  Do these people ever become relevant?  <br>That's not what I mean at all. It's all about camera angles, or whatever the equivalent would be for anime. In  showing so much of the bath detracts from the scene. A close-up or something more dynamic would work better.<br><br><br>Also not what I mean. Scenes like  are a nice detail.<br>Also</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Himawari <br> not Ayano <br><br>Explain, Ukraine.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>literally who<br>  no really who  </br></br>  <br>In a spinoff maybe.</br>  <br>Yuru reset</br>  <br> Futanari Himawari <br>If only</br></br>  <br> showing so much of the bath detracts from the scene. <br>It's not the most interesting shot, I guess, but I don't think it's bad. Honestly I can't think of other ways to handle showing Sakurako pranking Himawari while she's washing her hair that aren't unavoidably ecchi.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128181668 <br>Fine I'm a bit biased because I'm not a pun person, but even I giggle at the grand pun exchange between Yui and Ayano.<br><br>You just need to get better material<br> Take it as a challenge and make me laugh </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> not a pun person <br> using exclusively Yui reaction images <br><br>Irony = funny, amirite?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yui gotta be kidding me.</br>  <br>That's because I'm a Yuifag, nothing wrong with that.<br><br><br>I chuckled</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If you found that funny, you really are full of it Nunavat.</br></br>  <br>Ayano I'm not funny; you don't have to rub it in.</br>  <br><br> it's funny when Ayano exchanges puns with Yui, but not funny if literally everyone else tries the exact same pun scheme <br><br>10/10, I've taken the bait. Tell my parents that I love them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>sakurako has NOTHING</br>  <br>When I saw the initial screens I thought I was going to feel the same way, but the actual scene was actually rather funny and tasteful, nothing too overtly lewd about it.</br>  <br>you can't be this retarded, even in the show when Ayano puns Yui laughs like an idiot, when Kyouko puns Yui doesn't even try to pretend it was funny</br>  <br>she has shampoo though???</br>  <br><br> cute girls that get embarassed easily <br> no one bats an eyelash in the OVA about going full nude in front of everyone else <br><br>I don't get it. Does the steam in bathhouses change your brain?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More like everyone in Japan is so used to seeing each other naked that body-accentuating clothes are what they find lewd.</br>  <br>It's different for bath houses. In fact bath scene nudity isn't even considered ecchi, and happens even in the most innocent series, becuase nips are used to naked bodies in public baths.</br>  <br>I only called it sexual because another anon said he face-palmed and thought he shouldn't mind it so much. But I did think it was a bit boring, sorry.</br>    <br>I enjoyed the gags that they had in the bathhouse, but humour is subjective. I respect your opinion, anon-chan!</br>  <br><br> "I respect your opinion" <br><br>Am I even on 4chan right now? Where am I?</br></br></br></br>  <br>In a comfy yuru yuri thread.</br>  There's a distinct lack of Chitose art on Pixiv and Danbooru. How sad.  Which Yuru do you think is Namori's favourite?  <br>Akari. That's why she bullies her.</br>  <br>Which Yuru got her own spinoff, anon?</br>    <br>Nadeshiko!</br>  <br> I'd like to think so because Akari is my favourite too. <br><br><br>Honestly I think that indicates that she wanted to show more of Nadeshiko and Hanako than Sakurako being her fave.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Sakurako is my favourite, but she loves Akari-chan so of course I do too!</br>  <br>That always confuses me. I don't think it would matter if I was used to communal bathing or not, if I were in a bath with my crush I would freak out, but it's like that always gets ignored. Octave being a notable exception.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Anyways I think Akari and Sakurako fans have the largest fanbase overlap between any Yurus, so either choice is fine.<br>They are also the two popularity poll winners among nips.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> It's a tie between Best Genkis</br></br>  <br>still mad about the het fling</br>  The OTP  <br>Except Kyoko is actually good at things</br>  <br>Funny anon, now that you mention it I realize that my top three girls are essentially Akari, her developing lover, and her fangirl. Basically Akari is the pillar of my Yuru love and her bestness is what decides who follows her.</br>  <br>Different culture.<br>You see that even lolis get bath scenes for example in anime, while they have a hard time getting any real fanservice, and it's because of that same reason too.<br>Bathhouse nudity is just natural in japan. Unless they take extra efford making it ecchi, it isn't even considered lewd or fanservice.</br></br></br>  <br>Sakurako is good at being cute, fun, and beautiful.</br>  <br> Where's the yuru thread, yuris? <br>on /v/<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;&gt;/v/302810737 </br></br></br>  <br> Still having best girl arguments <br> Still talking about China being a rapist <br>I bet the majority of them have never even made it past 5 chapters of the manga.</br></br></br>    <br>Stay mad. Octave is perfect.</br>  <br>Sakurako is bad and drawing, studying, cooking, and any kind of skill required for a student council member.</br>  <br>There's a distinct lack of Chitose in general.</br>  <br> her developing lover <br>Is that Chinatsu?<br>Just asking because my top three are Akari &gt; Sakurako &gt; Chinatsu.</br></br></br>  <br>I love Octave, but I really do hate how the MC had sex with a dude she didn't know. I don't care that he was a dude, I'd be just as mad if it was a girl. She didn't know the person, and was already in love with a beautiful woman. It makes me sick thinking about what she put herself and Setsuko through.</br>  <br>Her being childish is one of Sakurako's most endearing qualities.</br>  <br>i exhaled through my nose at a faster rate than normal for almost a second</br>  <br>W-we have the exact same best girl order.<br>Can I be your friend, anon-chan?</br></br>  <br>I just want her to be good, but I can't find any redeeming qualities for her.<br><br>Even the spinoff manga doesn't make it all that easier.</br></br></br>  <br>But it's because she's terrible. Setsuko was partially responsible for it as well.</br>    <br>Sure.</br>  <br>It just really broke my heart. Even thinking about it now makes me feel awful  and I kind of want to cry. </br>  <br>Good at what?<br>Like I said, she has many endearing and lovely features.</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry anon. tbh it is pretty heartbreaking, for both parties. But at least they discuss it (eventually) and move past it! That's why I actually like it as an aspect of the story. Even though reading it makes you feel like crap.</br>  <br>She and Himawari love each other. Do you really want to ruin that love by changing them?</br>  <br>i don't understand the third from the left in the top row...</br>  <br>I don't feel like Sakurako being less of a useless shit would ruin their love. If anything, Himawari loves Sakurako in spite of her personality most of the time and she honestly deserves more.</br>  <br>Whoever edited the picture is a shit.</br>  <br><br><br>Ren-chon is also some 120-ish cm actually.<br>There was some joke about it that I don't remember exactly, maybe something about the top of her hair gave her extra height.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's why beside Koma-chan's height it says "self-proclaimed". Learn to read first.</br>  <br>She's a good cook. She made pancakes. That's about it, I think</br>  Chitose a best  <br>More please. Her and Chinatsu. Those are the two I wish to lewd.</br>    <br>Is it possible to lewd Chinatsu?</br>  <br>Thank you.<br><br><br>I hope so. I mean I like all of them but Chitose and Chinatsu are amazing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Alright, Chinatsu really is quite sensual.</br>  Chinatsu is a satan  <br>Do they have pubic hair?</br>  <br>What went wrong after the first volume?</br>  <br>I like to think they shave/wax, but that's only because I'm a pervert.</br>  <br><br>I think the smaller girls don't have any, or just have weak, silky, hard to notice pubes.<br>Chinatsu is probably smooth as a newborn though.</br></br></br>    <br> Chinatsu is probably smooth as a newborn though </br>  <br>The thought makes me very horny.

Nothing is going on with HxH.<br>You will be allowed to worry if it isn't back in 1 year from now.</br>  I can't smile again .Come on Togashi .  <br>Togashi finally beat his high score in DDR</br>  <br>No, stop making the same thread every day. The only thing HxH related coming out, is 99 re-encoded when i get back to it</br>  Togashi probably fought with them over something related to games.  <br>It's the only way.</br>  <br>What's the point of HxH coming back if we're just gonna get some shitty art. At least D-Gray Man and Berserk are gonna have good art.</br>  <br>HxH would have good writing.</br>  <br><br>agree<br><br>Although i have yet to reread DrG, don't remember almost anything except the ark about someone's waifu getting a penis (strangely it got me right in the feels)</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>arch*</br></br>   Nen users can have an affinity to using an object <br> Gon has no fishing rod technique </br>  <br>He has an affinity to using Killua</br>  <br> he's a fucking Enhancer on top of it and a very strong one <br> he can probably reinforce his fishing rod so much nobody will be able to break it </br></br>  <br>That's because he uses it on a different rod</br>    Actually there was a rumour that Togashi is going to leave the manga and instead just spearhead the anime from where the last episode left off.  <br>Stop trying, nobody will ever believe your nonsense.</br>  <br> www.animenewsnetwork.com/togashi-hx<wbr>h-rumours-confirmed</wbr> <br><br>BTFO<br>T<br>F<br>O</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are you trying to force this<br>Next you're going to post a fake link</br></br>  <br>The writing is HxH's saving grace, I'm down for crude chicken scratches.</br>  <br><br> HxH <br> Good writing </br></br></br>  <br> sea dandy <br>opinion discarded</br></br>  <br>this bitch again</br>  <br> berserk fans are getting off the boat and we still haven't got on yet </br>  <br> filename <br>The more I think about it, Gon wasn't exactly mad at Pitou. I think the reason he was like that was more because of the fact that his morality was shaken to the very core, and he didn't know how to handle that. But he wasn't mad, per se.</br></br>  <br>At the end, Gon was more angry at himself and his weakness than angry at Pitou, Pitou just happened to be a very convenient scapegoat for his rage.</br>  <br>I agree he probably wasn't mad.I think he lost the closest thing he had to a father figure, and he blamed himself for it just as much as he blamed Pitou.</br>  <br>I would have to seriously question someone's standards if they think recent chapters are 'chicken scratch'. Togashi art ranges from good to decent most of the time, only 7 volumes in total were terrible.</br>  <br> only 7 volumes <br> only <br>Yeah 70 chapters is, like, nothing.</br></br></br>  <br> 20% of the manga has shit art <br>don't give togashi too much credit</br></br>  <br>It's 'only' relative to the fact that people think the entire ~32 volume series is irredeemably shitty scribbles. This meme needs to stop because idiots refuse to read the manga because of it.</br>  <br>did I indicate that recent chapters were chicken scratch? You're supposed to gather the fact that I'd read hxh regardless, as long as the writing was kept up to standard.</br>  Just finished reading the latest chapter.<br><br>Can't believe something so good is rarely updated. I'm scared that Togashi will never regularly write/draw HxH again, and he will die of old age or simply cancel it before he does. <br><br>Fuck. It feels like the story and characters had just gotten started.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I was expecting him to develop a technique based around his fishing pole, but it never happened. Oh well. I like Jangen a bit.</br>  <br>The thing is that in the interwebz there isnt a torrent with the volume scanlations of HxH which are redrawn... Most of it is the weekly jump scan</br>  <br>janken*</br>  So other companies still care for HxH more than Togashi.<br><br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/int<wbr>erest/2015-07-13/the-cast-of-hunter<wbr>-x-hunter-join-puzzle-and-dragons-g<wbr>ame/.90395</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Hahaha holy shit.<br><br> Togashi: Now... I want to keep playing games with dragons in them... but I also need to finish up HxH... how can I put those 2 together... </br></br></br>  <br>why is this news when PAD did this like a year ago?</br>  Would you beat the fuck out of this guy if you caught him walking down the street?  <br><br>Well thats your idotic fault for reading the manga. 9 chapters of setup for a new arc isnt worth ruining the perfct closure of the anime.</br></br>  <br>they're bringing it back with updated cards</br>  <br> perfect closure <br>Haha no.</br></br>  <br>No. He's already sick enough that he can't work on HxH on a regular basis. It would be awful to add broken bones and/or bruising to that.</br>  <br>lies. that leads nowhere</br>  <br>Togashi obviously stopped caring. He even gave the middle finger to shueisha by going on hiatus just when he was one chapter short of having enough content for a new volume.<br><br>I doubt his back hurts, he just wants to keep milking his WSJ contract while doing jackshit and playing videogames with his kids.<br><br>tbh I'd do the same if I was in his position</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> perfect closure <br>It's closure for sure, but it's far from being perfect</br></br>  <br> 9 chapters of setup <br>The entire election arc was setup for DC</br></br>  <br>So, Pitou is male or female?</br>  <br>Ha ha yes. Gon found his dad, says good bye to Killua, end of story. Im perfectly fine if the hiatus never ends. You arent because you read those chapters and are looking forward to something like a fool. I couldn't care less.</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>We'll have to disagree that Gon finding his dad and taking a break from Killua is "perfect closure."</br>  <br>Meh not really, its barely mentioned, to the point where its easy to ignore.</br>  <br>Probably female.</br>  <br>Well then I should rephrase it as perfect closure for me, I dont need anything more. And if more starts coming out it will be a hapy suprse.</br>  <br>Not him buuuut...<br> no Gon vs. Hisoka final showdown <br> Troupe shenanigans still left unresolved <br> Pariston's plans for the Chimera Ant eggs still left unresolved <br>It's "perfect" in that there's actually a tiny bit of closure but it is by no means perfect by non-Togashi standards</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>things that haven't been settled<br> hisoka's fight with gon <br> gon's mom <br> alluka's origins <br> kurapica's revenge <br> Chrollo getting his nen back  <br> gyro's future  <br><br>Are you really ok with these loose ends?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It seems like you're just saying this to be a smug little fuck. Because the anime ending is nowhere near "perfect closure" by most peoples' standards.</br>  <br> &gt;gon's mom <br>this will never happen anyway</br></br>  <br>My head canon is that Gon never gets his nen back so the story is over. Its kinda realistic, sometimes in life we get in over our heads and over react and pay a steep price for the rest of our lives.<br><br>Sure there are still things that would be cool to see but the MCs journey is over, what are you gonna do? We dont always get what we want in life.<br><br>This is my mentality unlless chapters start coming out again then ill hype up again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Are you really ok with these loose ends? <br>Yes. Not everything needs to be explained for an ending to be good.<br><br><br> head canon <br>Tumblrina, please.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is a pretty good way of thinking about it if togashi never does finish the manga. Gon's story is effectively over.</br>  <br>You mean gon vs lucifer showdown.<br>Lucifer clearly better than hisoka</br></br>  <br>Gon has no reason to take on Chrollo, dude, whereas Hisoka fighting him in his prime has been hyped up since the Hunter Exam.</br>  <br>Chrollo has no interest in Gon tho. Hisoka has a raging hard on for him</br>  What is your opinion on Gon's delicious shota thighs?  <br>There is, on bakabt. I have personally mentioned this multiple times on /a/ to spoonfeed people.</br>  <br>You'd better stop.</br>  <br>I make an exception to spoonfeed for this because I'm sick of anime onlyfags dismissing the entire manga based on that turkey page</br>  <br>fappable</br>  Will we ever see the Troupe again? They're my favorite group of misfits, and they still have two more open spots that need replacing.    Wait what<br>what news about D.Gray man?<br>Is it starting again?</br></br>  <br>But the story isn't just about Gon</br>  <br>It was during the Chimera Ant, if you think that it wasn't then you weren't paying attention.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=P6u<wbr>JqtgBOZ4</wbr>  [ ]  <br>We'll never see the Troupe again, because the anime ending had perfect closure.</br>  <br> perfect closure <br> kurapica still hasn't wiped out the phantom troupe </br></br>  <br>D-Gray Man is alive and back with improved art unlike HxH.</br>  <br>being fair he did have a broken arm through a good portion of the Chimera ants arc</br>   tfw Leorio is the best supporting character in the series and way better than Edgeua <br> tfw completely squandered </br>  <br>I think the manga did a poor job of wrapping up if he intended to quit there. 2011 remake only bugged me a bit because I already read the manga.</br>  <br> Killua <br> edgy <br>I don't even like him but that's just wrong</br></br></br>  <br> Shitty art <br>Did you catch up with the manga? This is everything but shitty art, that meme is stupid anyway.</br></br>  What is your favorite Pika?  <br>All of them.</br>  <br>At a certain point /a/ needs to accept that the funny bro characters are not necessarily all that interesting or well written. Killua and his relationship with Gon have gotten so much development that at this point, he's much better characterized than Leorio.<br><br>He has potential but if a character is cool from the start that's lessened.</br></br></br>  <br>Dark Continent is so open ended it literally writes itself m8</br>  <br>Togashi isn't known for his art but for his writing. Yeah he may have some standout artwork here and there but in general it's mediocre to average and at times really shitty. I don't read HxH for the art because really who does, but for the story/writing.</br>  so I watched the madhouse Anime rendition and i want to read the manga, would /a/ suggest i read the manga from the start or just pick up after the chimera arc in the manga?  <br>It is redrawn in volumes, most of them, when it's not, it's shitty indeed but saying that the art is always bad and that it will be the case when he will come back is retarded. The last 9 chapters had no bad art at all, with a lot of details.</br>  <br>Read the first arc, YorK Shin arc, the beginning of the Ant arc and you are good IMO.</br>  <br>read from the start</br>  <br>Correct answer</br>  <br> if my manga art doesn't have Miura levels of detail it's shit </br>  <br>Nobody would even call it mediocre if it wasnt for the really awful chapters dragging their overall opinion of it down, that's why nobody complains about the art in Level E or YYH. They wouldn't call it amazing either, it's just pretty good and he's got a nice style. <br><br>I felt completely rused when I read the manga because all anyone did was shit on it, but when it was good it was good.</br></br></br>  <br>From the start.</br>  <br>the current edgy one</br>  <br>Come on mate. He was edgy as fuck in the first arc.</br>  <br> At a certain point /a/ needs to accept that the funny bro characters are not necessarily all that interesting or well written <br><br>This. And even then, Knuckle, Shoot, and Morel are all way cooler than Leorio anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>Even Katsura Hoshino with a wrist injury draws better than Togashi.</br>  <br>It's almost as though he got development or something.</br>  <br>I stand by my point.</br>  <br>He's still edgy, he just hides it better.</br>  CRAAAAWLING IIIIN MY SKIIIIN    <br>Does edgy even mean anything anymore?</br>  <br>What point? That Togashi has average to mediocre art.<br><br>Honestly Togashi's strong point is his storytelling.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Edgyposting aside, how come Killua couldn't attack Rammot with the needle in his head? I get that he needed a chance to get rid of the damn thing for the story's sake, but he was able to destroy Rammot easily once he got rid of it, when I thought the point of the needle is that it prevented him from attacking opponents stronger than him.</br>  <br>Nigga, he's from a family of assassins, of course he's still going to be a little edgy. I like that part about him. He's not the faggot that beheads people for brushing shoulders with him anymore.</br>   you will never penetrate Killua and then watch as he leaks out   <br>I am serious, in action or killer mode it's easier to see it.</br>  <br> it prevented him from attacking opponents stronger than him. <br>More like it kept him from doing anything he didn't have a 100% chance at succeeding, that and IIRC he didn't want to cock block Gon.</br></br>  <br>Because he didn't exactly know how strong Rammot was, so he assumed he was stronger<br>Bisky explains this</br></br>  <br>This can't be edgy.</br>  <br><br>Huh. All it took was a little killing intent to make Rammot shit his pants, he didn't even get a chance to do anything before the needle told him to get the fuck out.</br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>He may have mellowed out, but once he encounters a troupe member on the boat on the way to DC, he'll be back in league with theses edgy characters.</br>  <br> Is something going on with HxH? <br><br>Berserk and HxH aren't allowed to be released in the same year. It's a japanese law, look it up. The last time it happened, japan got hit with a giant tidal wave in 2011.</br></br></br>  Killua was edgy, but Kurapika never was or is edgy. you retards don't even know what edgy means.  <br>He probably thought he had something to prove because he was trying to protect Gon, so he put more pressure on himself.</br>  Never knew there was something like this<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nDg<wbr>WDlvvaNQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Did he.....?</br>  <br>Well good thing that's just faggy fanfiction, then</br>  <br> ,,, </br>  <br>He did. And chimera ants can get boys pregnant, it just takes much longer before they give birth.</br>  <br> forced to have a child with the faggot bunny clown fuck <br>Jesus christ.</br></br>  <br><br>I like how in the Chimera Ant arc you can see the shotas actually have some muscles on their arms/legs after all the training they've done</br></br>  <br>Why does all fan art portray Gon and Killua as skinny wimps? They look much better with muscle.</br>  <br>Even Madhouse did it, this is from the second ED</br>  <br>read from the start.</br>  <br>It's weird how Skinny MadHouse made him and Killua considering how they both have baby fat in the manga.</br>  <br>Recently I've been working on a theory about when the Troupe will be the main bad dudes again. Here goes, this'll probably be stupid<br><br>So provided they do about as much during whatever makes up the DC arc as they did in the CA arc (they might just pop in and wreck shit up for some laughs) I think the next likely arc or event they'll reappear in as the major antagonists will be whatever the Battle Olympia tournament shows up in. My reasoning is this: Chrollo had to get Kurapika's nen chain removed, but Chrollo also had the great misfortune of needing to steal people's powers to use them. In theory, if an exorcist has to remove foreign nen from Chrollo to get the chain out, I think there's a good chance he won't just remove the chain, but there'll be the added side effect of resetting Chrollo's powers back to 0.<br><br>So what do? Well what else? The Phantom Troupe like to steal things, and I'm sure they'd want to celebrate having their boss back in the club. So why not crash Battle Olympia and steal the nen abilities of all the world's best fighters?<br><br>That's the idea anyways. Though, considering how far out of left field both the CA and DC arcs came, I wouldn't be surprised if some completely different plot element came up to throw a wrench in this speculation</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is Jojo as good as this?  If you were in madokas situation, what would you wish for?  <br><br>I wish for the death of the universe.<br><br>Take that QB.</br></br></br></br>  That the Quarter Backs would stop existing.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128192578 <br>Wrong.

This is so terrible.  ps4 duh  I'd wish for half of Coobie's race to become the most emotional beings in the universe.  <br>In different timelines madoka is best friends with homura , sayaka and mami</br>  <br> Sayaka got romantically NTR'd by Hitomi and platonically NTR'd by Homura <br><br>Being Sayaka is suffering</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128192578 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128193866 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128194062 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128194357 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128194851 <br>Do you have that pic where naked Mado and Homu from the last episode are hugging and Madoka is about to call her her best friend but then Homura starts licking Madoka's nipples and Madoka calls her her worst friend?<br><br>You seem like the kind of guy who would have that saved.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   violin fag didn't even let Sayaka, the person that visited him by far the most and provided the most emotional support, know when he left the hospital <br><br>I should have seen her cucking coming a mile away</br></br>  <br>Two vaginas.</br>  <br> no matter what you're gonna be strong enough to one shot wallburger at this point <br> thinking there's any amount of anything you can't take in a single hole </br></br>  <br> Madoka: Bland, generic, basically a walking plot device. <br><br> Kyousuke: Obsessive with his violin, doesn't give Sayaka a second thought at any time of the day, takes out his problems on other people. <br><br> Hitomi: Total bro who put Sayaka ahead of herself and gave Sayaka a fair head start on winning over Kyousuke because knew Sayaka liked him first. <br><br> Kyouko: Feisty red head who loves her unconditionally, gives her all the attention in the world, and will literally die for her just so she won't have to be lonely. <br><br>No matter how you look at it, Sayaka lucked out big time and got the better end of the deal with both her friend and her lover.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be able to summon other magical girls from other universes and not have them bound by this universe's rules. <br>So Symphogear girls can destroy witches by singing to keep the relics going and they don't witch out themselves. <br>Or just get Cardcaptor Sakura to solo Waluigi's Knight and solve all the issues Homura failed at.</br></br></br>  Is Rebellion worth watching?  Seems like she could have just wished to become a god and then enact the law of cycles without being bound to it for all of time. <br><br>But I don't know, maybe that wasn't allowed in such specific terms. The wish she made anyway was already pretty smart as well as being selfless, so there's no real reason to change it.<br><br>Maybe just "and this law of cycles can never be changed or affected by any outside force" to stop the Kyuubey's/Homura from messing with it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>wish for infinite energy</br>  <br>Yes.

I'm skeptical about watching it because alot of things i've heard makes it sound like some retcon filled fanfic.<br><br>Homura spends the film trying to reverse the wish from Madoka she clearly accepted in the series end or something?

She sold her soul for it.</br>      <br> Rebellion <br> story. <br>Ha, good one anon. That's like saying Homura has a character.</br></br></br>  <br>he fucked a violin and a green haired chick instead though</br>  <br>All in the past now.<br>Baka has her qt red head now.</br></br>    <br>Kevin claims to be her man now. He has expressed severe homuhate so I trust him.</br>    <br> seriously believing the incubators' lies </br>      <br>They're straight.

It was made out of pure evil, loveless desire for power and it created hell on earth. Death is better than Homura.</br>  <br>I'd wish I was never born</br>    I'd wish for what she did, only I'd keep out the "with my own hands" part so I don't pseudo-die doing it. Wipe out all witches, enjoy life.    <br>as far as the original series is concerned it clearly wasn't made as a desire for power.</br>  <br> created hell on earth <br>A hell with no witches or incubators to fuck with it. Sounds like a pretty safe, comfy hell to me.</br></br>    <br>Too bad Rebellion retconned everything and said it was. Madoka never loved or valued Homushit because she never did an ounce of good.</br>    <br> loveless desire for power <br>Did you even watch the fucking movie? Power was never what Homura wanted. She just wanted a world where Madoka was safe and happy (by Homura's standards) because she wants Madoka. It's a selfish creepy borderline yandere love.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, she's fucked up, but you couldn't possibly be any more incorrect. Gaining power was never her desire. She just wanted Madoka.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Cake.</br>  <br>when i was first hearing her wish i was kind of expecting it to cause every potential magical girl to cease to exist just because that would ensure it no witches, and their magical girl state counts as "before the witch is born".<br><br>Glad it didn't turn out that way</br></br></br>    non non  <br>Nonon?</br>  nonon  kei tai  <br>who's there?</br>  <br><br> SHINKANSEN </br></br>  <br>Two.</br>  <br>Does she get bullied in Tokyo?</br>  threadly reminder that natsumi is perfection  <br>Threadly reminder nobody likes Natsumi<br><br> Beaten by a side character with less screen time than her </br></br></br>    <br><br>It's not Konomi's fault that her voice gives me a nostalgic boner</br></br>  Objectively correct NNB best girls ranking:<br> Candy Store <br> Renge <br> Natsumi <br> Teacher <br> Komachi <br> Higake <br> Hotarun </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Komachi </br>  <br>Shit.
