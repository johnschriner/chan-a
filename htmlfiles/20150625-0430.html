[ why is she so smug? and why does she make my dick diamonds.    Because you like sluts.     She makes your dick diamonds because she is so smug. She is smug because she knows she can easily make your dick diamond.    I was reluctant to watch the anime because smug-chan is so perfect in the manga. Then I marathoned the season in one sitting when i heard her voice. Perfect VA for smug-chan. Somehow made her even more perfect. Who cares about the shitty plot and insufferable MC, smugchan was worth sitting through 12 episodes of mediocre trash all by herself.   the last time i felt that way about a great character in a shitty series was Kazuma in Kaze no Stigma.          /thread    Quick, I need to see more of her smug face         why does she make my dick diamonds  Its all in the VA.    Why does Guren, that sexy fuck, have such a fantastic harem?   Hayamin is 90%, but the character design is based too.         Smug lolis are always sexy.     I want to break that smug.   I want to lick that neck.   Vampire please go.    If anyone deserves a harem, it's Guren.    Because the smug is just an emotional cover-up, a self-pritection.  It's those few, far-apart moments when she goes full dere (pic related) that make her attractive. The rest of time, you tolerate the smug because you are focused on not missing one of those incredible dere flashes.       tolerating the smug   not embracing it       Don't stop     Can't embrace a shit show    waifufags     tolerate   embrace  Either works. What you get in the end is still pic related. And it's DIAMONDS.         Stay mad vampire, smugchan will seize mc's chastity and not you. Your fate is elsewhere, to pick up the trumpet.      They did that scene justice. And those little noises the seiyuu was making... MY DICK     All the "waifufag" threads always have plenty of Guren/Kureto/Ferid/Crowley/Mahiru/Y<wbr>u talk in them too.</wbr>    Does anyone like Goshi?     Nobody does Smug like Saori Hayami, noted lounge singer.  https://<span>youtu.be/4SFavXl4J7A?t=582  [ ]  She even looks smug IRL most of the time. Go look up her picture and try to find one where it doesn't look like she's incredibly impressed with herself.          She always does that pretty much.  https://<span>youtu.be/aQyY1yfC8p4?t=647  [ ]       Great but not the best or sexiest loli in the series since that belongs to Krul.     Saori Hayami is never really a bad choice and just knows how to stand out. Only time she couldn't improve a character really and make them the show any time she was on screen was Miyuki Shiba because they gave her literally absolutely nothing to work with beyond ONII-SAMA!  Even here she's finding a way to stand out and she's not even really doing anything. All that other trash is wearing skirts and color coordinated outfits but you see she's too good for that so she'll just take the actual servers one.      Krul has a severe impediment of her fukkboi being a gay autist.  unless Krul is actually a shota in disguise     They set a giant loose among midgets.      shota in disguise   Possible.       Miyuki was a treasure, you monster. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rL-<wbr>nx3FXZF4</wbr>  [ ]      You can pretty much always pick Hayamin out in a seiyuu group shot because she towers over just about everyone aside from maybe Haruka Tomatsu. The average height for a woman in Japan is 158cm. Both are 164.      and why does she make my dick diamonds.  Shit characters tend to do that to anons.     Everyone is actually a shota in disguise.    Guren/Shinoa Mahouka AU art when    Smug/Angry Hayami is literally the only time her voice acting isn't complete shit tier.    I wanted to die about fifteen seconds in. Jesus Christ.    How can you live with such shit taste. Her soft voice while she's saying onii-chan is the best thing ever.    She's amazing in Yamada    Ugly 3dpd VAs ruin my perfect delusions.     liking her soft voice   enjoying the essence of ear cancer      Take it to      being an uncurable homosexual and fag  I feel sorry for you. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=h1A<wbr>YrdNrWC8</wbr>  [ ]      Keep your ugly whores out of /a/ - 2D/Random.     Not him but normalfag pls go    So who is this Kururu slut I keep hearing about?    The most perfect being in the universe and also best girl. I want her to step on me.       those bony arms  Fuck, it seems she really does everything to look good, even if it's unhealthy. I wish people wouldn't care about looks that much, she's actually cute anyway. And we don't like her for her body.     The enemy of humankind        bony arms   Murrifat with big bones detected.       Every time I see an OnS thread I want to self insert into the show and go full Father Andersen mode on everyone    Not murrican, but look at her shoulders and wrists. They are a bit too anorexic. Otherwise her arms would be good, I like girls with fragile looks. I just hope she's perfectly okay, okay?     But muh 2.5D     That's fairly normal size for an asian. A bit below-average, but not anorexic.   http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51056540</wbr>     She's pretty good. Shame she's smelly dumb vampire scum.     No.    you shouldn't have sat through 12 full episodes and just skipped through if all you were looking for were such scenes  she's absolutely not a loli  Krul was best girl  this guy gets it  Smug slug is disgusting            Mika, stop shitposting    I'm sorry the truth hurts.   She's the best waifu and Yu-kun knows it.   How about we praise a cute immortal loli vampire instead?      Mika, pls go.   I don't get it. She doesn't look smug.   Watch the anime or read the manga.  You'll get it.      muh vampire nigga    Oh lord, that face.    Never, she doesn't want oniisama     Whahaha~ What are we going to do in the SUV?    Nothing since you're too goddamn short.   Hayami Saori and Aoi Yuuki always voice best girls.      I love her. I love her so damn much.        Under 150 cm and small everything   Implying not loli  LRD pls go.             O-oh! You heard m-me Shinoa-senpai? Oh my, I guess you found out ehehehe  So... uhh WILL YOU GO OUT WITH ME AND PROMOTE THE CONTINUATION OF THE HUMAN RACE WITH MANY CHILDREN?!           Y-you too.     I thought I was going to hate that little fag but he actually turned up to be quite likeable.    For fuck's sake, Shinoa's not even the smuggest smug to smug this season.     Discount Armin was my favourite character in this show.       I'm with you guys, he's okay in my book.    tfw he will always be a virgin because he's too beta in a world of alphas          Shinoa will never be your boss      Who's this semen demon?    Why is she so perfect?        I don't get it. She doesn't look smug.  that's gotta be bait.   watch the anime or read the manga she's condensed and purified SMUG; and it's boner inducing.        Why is she so perfect?  it's the smug.  it's the constant trolling it's the small beautiful dere moments it's the fact she's not a tsundere it's the fact she's tiny and perflat  frankly, she's the best anime/manga girl in a long time to come out of area 11.            NTR'd in front of Ferid and the entire world  I'm pretty sure Mika's rage could power several jetpacks.    I DON'T WANT NOBODY TO GET KILLED     I'LL COME AND GET YOU, I AM ALWAYS READY TO FIGHT    SO DON'T TAKE ALL THE BLAME, WE ARE ALL AS BAD    I want to have my own Shinoa      DON'T TAKE ALL OF THE WEIGHT. YOU ALLWAYS DO    Don't worry. Unlike 3D girls there is an infinite supply of Shinoas for all.    WE'LL ALWAYS BE SOMETHING YOU CANNOT CONTROL      I want to have Shinoa figure, shame they care more with fujoshit  She is so cute even while running     Fu pls go.   No you Double Dick      not a gif        I have hope, fucking Asshime got a figure. If they did make a figure of her, it would probably be in the school uniform.   WHO HAS THE FULL ALBUM OF ALL SHINO SMUG TRANSPARENTS?  How many children Shinoa could have?   That depends. How many people are in this thread right now? Take that number and then account for the fact that most couples have around 1-2 children (i have no clue what the actual number is but I don't feel like trying to do numbers right now so that's my guess). Now take the number of people in this thread and have them all partake in sex with Shinoa which results in 1 or 2 childs. That's about how many.    But I would have way more babies with Shinoa than two. We would make our own smug football team.    CUCKED U C K E D         The kids in this show are so fucking dumb. The vampires basically have one strategy: Backflip behind you really fast. They do that constantly and you fall for it EVERY TIME.    But they do it super fast, anon.    Also, I just re-watched the few seconds after that. Where the hell was blue going? Coldsteel and drills went in the opposite direction.    Blue is Chess, Coldsteel is Crowley and drills is Horn. Just for future reference.    So swing around in a circle at all times and they can't touch you.    I knew Crowley but not the other two. Chess and Horn are retarded names.     Mika turns evil due to getting NTR'd   I can see it.      That is normal.    Well, anyone has a right to be smug when they're on the verge of dethroning Hanazawa.    Chess likes to play chess, Horn likes being horny  There is nothing wrong with that name      if only less than %1 women understood this concept. instead theyre all pathetic balls of crying and insecurity and no fun whatsoever.  oh wait maybe its the same for men       Banter is God's gift to man and we have neglected it      because smug is sexy OP    But she is cute anon.    how do those thighhigh feet smell like after a day running around in those boots?    But i won't share Shinoa with anyone   feetfags pls      It's not like I like Smug-chan or anything But I wouldn't mind r-ruffling her hair a little    Sex hair is always best hair.    Why don't they genetically engineer humans who have second faces looking backwards and two more arms bending back? They would be invincible to vampires.    Why do girl running like that?    Is she the Smuggernaut?    ask your mom    Isn't she already way too old for your taste, you old pedro?   This thread lacks happy shinoa   More sexy Shinoa.    You tried but you failed.     This threads needs to see more of her frusrated/despair face.   http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=42986852 Is this sexy? </wbr>    I think I ruptured my dick.    http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=manga&amp;illust_id=50478636</wbr>    Lewd    muh dick   Why did I finish this shitty show?  It's pretty terrible but I somehow didn't stop watching it.     Because of Smug-chan.   キャラクターデザイン門脇聡さんによる落書きのセラフ。 本日はクルル！1巻発売日なので正月的な雰囲気で！ 宣伝おーた #終わりのセラフ  New official twitter icons: http://owarino-seraph.jp/special/tw<wbr>itter.html</wbr>   Krul no shiro de odoritai.     that cute little kureto  I want a phone strap with his tiny frowny face on it now.    Vampire information (translated by  http://gomigeemu.tumblr.com/post/12<wbr>2336278313/vampire-information</wbr> ):  Page 122:  VAMPIRE Subtitle: A detested race that sucks living blood.  Picture caption: The amount of vampires that drink to excess outweigh those who will not let their partner die.  Header: The leaders of an apocalyptic world Article: Rather than humans, currently they are the ones who control the world’s surface. While 8 years ago they lived underground without human’s knowledge, when the world ended they appeared on the surface. They want to world to remain stable, so they broke the taboo and proposed to overthrow humans.  Box: The vampire’s biology  Header: Red eyes and pointed ears Explanation: They possess beautiful nihilistic eyes and pointed ears. The eyes are effective in the dark, and even when things are pitch black they can distinguish someone several hundred meters away.  Header: Pointed fangs Explanation: They’re well-shaped to pierce human skin and help easily drain blood. In the circumstances one is forced to have a vampire bite them, it leaves two small marks.  Header: A body that doesn’t age Explanation: At the very least they live for several hundred years, and no matter for how long they keep their youthful appearance. How powerful they are depends on how long they’ve lived.  Header: Ultra-violet ray neutralizing equipment Explanation: They have equipment to neutralize the effect ultra-violet rays can have on their body, which produces a toxin when exposed to it. On the occasion that vampires, who hate sunlight, go to the surface, they are sure to wear it.                            Header: A body 7 times more powerful than a human Explanation: Including their leg and arm strength, their entire power transcends that of a human. Furthermore, they can be brought back to life and torn off limbs can also instantaneously be reattached.  Box: How to defeat a vampire Explanation: You could try to destroy the vampire’s head, but destroying the ultra-violet rays equipment located on their left arm while they’re under sunlight would do it. Also, weapons like demon gear and so on’s curses that work against vampires are effective. However, there is the difficulty of the overwhelming power and offensive they can inflict.  Page 123:  Header: Humans changing into a vampire Article: By having a human drink their blood, the human in question’s body transforms. Only nobles have the authority to give their blood. However, due to vampires hating to increase their numbers, there is generally not much chance to do this.  Caption: According to how Mika was changed into a vampire thanks to Krul, they receive their Master’s power, and he was bestowed with high battle prowess.  Stamp: Results Report of secret intelligence activity Header: About the system and laws of vampire society Article: The vampires whom have no interests outside of blood desire a stable world and established a law to prevent the human population from decreasing. Committing to this, the high ranking nobles and founders ensure that there are sanctions in place. Everyone conscientiously leads a life observing these regulations, but there is no little amount of vampires who consider it troublesome.  Krul picture title: There’s to be no touching of taboo experiments Krul picture caption: According to the high ranking founders, things tied to the world’s collapse are absolutely taboo.  Lacus picture title: Drinking blood directly from the source is prohibited Lacus picture caption: Due to vampires killing their partners, there is an obligation to indirectly drink blood.

Smugtrolldere loli with ZR is instant diamond material.    http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=50357521</wbr>     Header: Ultra-violet ray neutralizing equipment   Explanation: They have equipment to neutralize the effect ultra-violet rays can have on their body, which produces a toxin when exposed to it. On the occasion that vampires, who hate sunlight, go to the surface, they are sure to wear it.  I think the anime removed hers for no apparent reason       Header: Ultra-violet ray neutralizing equipment  Shouldn't they wear helmets too then? This magic bs doesn't make any sense.     I don't think the concept of magic got to you    Well the magic of that pic certainly got to me.      Scans when?    when you buy it and scan for us    If it doesn't get scanned by cour 2 then maybe I will.    She makes my dick diamonds too. Her whole family does     Her whole family does  Good taste.      They must have some superb genes.      Kureto  Good fucking taste but Shinya is best boy but Kureto is a very close second     Other than Skrillex all of them (even Robodad) are pretty attractive in looks and personality.     I think the anime removed hers for no apparent reason  The reason is called budget.     Shinya is a foster child, but he sure is best boy.    You really think they didn't bother to draw 2 thick line because they weren't given another 10 dollars?    Polar opposite opinion for me. I hate the anime and her voice in it. In the manga I like her though. I was expecting something cooler/deeper, maybe slightly seductive. She sounds too bratty and high pitched for a smug character.    Was that the best scene of the season? Or was it Shinoa driving?    Less popular characters get figures so I don't see why she wouldn't. But the marketing and merch for this show is predominantly fujo, true. I don't think there's even a magazine spread with her.     inb4 obvious joke that she's too small for a magazine spread     The car scene was the best comedy, but the hospital is the sweetest.    Actually, that is the lyrics to the full song. The lyrics in the thread were specific to the op for the anime.    What if Shinoa became a vampire?  Would you serve her? Let her suck your blood?     Well ok then Kureto is best full blooded boy    Krul is basically vampire Shinoa    I want to see both mothers one day.   I want to suck her blood   I want a gold statue of robodad's dick for making such fine specimens    There's no "we are all as bad", and it's not like the TV Size changes lyrics from the full one. I bet you all took the lyricalnonsense one as the official one.    even skrillex ? if yes , you would be the first person ever who likes him     http://artbooksnat.tumblr.com/post/<wbr>118615740122/owari-no-seraph-newtyp<wbr>e  Does this count as a spread?  </wbr></wbr>    Probably.

My nigga.      thread    only when I kept going in 4chan          Childhood friend that has loved MC since forever   Some bitch shows up and MC is floored by her   Childhood friend loses  EVERY FUCKING TIME  KILL ALL NEWCOMERS CHILDHOOD FRIEND IS TRUE END           It's unfair but realistic.    love a guy since how long   do fucking nothing because you think you have all the time in the world   lose to the first assertive slut that shows up   wonder why you lost  Yeah. No.      They deserve it. They've had all the time in the world to make clear they want to be more than friends, but they never make a move. They don't "own" the MC just because they saw him first, they're seriously shit tier girls.    realistic  Really? All the people I've known are married usually start off with them being early romances, sometimes as early as grade school.  blog   And it always hurts when the childhood friend loses         Childhood friend has had years to confess   Has spent that time friend zoning herself instead   Childhood friends have only themselves to blame for losing.     I always wondered something.   Yugi Moutou   Seto Kaiba   4kids exec: those are OK   Jounochi Makoto   Hiroto Honda   Anzu Mazaki   NOPE TOO MUCH MOON CHANGE IT   Why?  Also, YGO thread               Why did Yu-Gi-Oh become shit after chapter 59?    Probably thought:  a. As long as they dont change the names of the two main duelists, fans of the original wont be as pissed b. Yugi and Kaiba have short, easy to pronounce names. So Jounouchi is definitely out of the question. No honda because of the car company possibly, and if you ask me, Anzu was probably too japanese to pronounce even though it's short.     Is the series actually worth watching?   Watch abridged instead. Marik and Bakura make the show.     I doubt 4kids gave a shit about the fans. Yugi and Kaiba maintained their names for being MCs, that's it.   AIIIIBOOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<wbr>UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU</wbr>  Yugi and Kaiba were 2 huge asian stereotypes (nerdy kid and neurotic overachiever). The rest aren't  What is Kumiko saying to Shu1?    i also masturbated to you before    She admitting that she will never get the part down.   That's actually Reina talking to Shu1 in that shot.   In the name of St. Kaori.   I'm a gay homosexual lesbian and Reina is my girlfriend    Died for all our  Reina's  sins    tfw can't sleep because Midori is just too cute.   Send help    Nothing. Reina caught Shuichi talking shit about Taki Sensei, and Kumiko is now looking at her.     The patron saint of talentless hacks.      She's my favourite background character.  Praise kyoani for cute background waifus.      umaku naritai     When does it get good, you faggots lied to me    Have all of you taken your daily time to thanks KyoAni?   She deserves more screen time.     You guys must be fun at parties.     Show me your bussy    I'll fight you fagott.      I wish the anime went over the reason why she considered backing Kaori in the audition. Both she and Hazuki are given such little screentime as it is, it's unfortunate when good scenes that they do have get cut.  But maybe KyoAni's just saving the scene for something else.     Don't talk about Taki-Sensei in front of the crazy bitch, she almost killed me last time I did.   I want to be almost killed by Reina.    Hey, did you know Satoshi saw your dick?     At this point im wondering what her purpose even is. What does she and Hazuki do in the later novels?    realisticfag gtfo pls    Can you blame him? He was  __gay__.      I wish the anime went over the reason why she considered backing Kaori in the audition.  But they did. Are you actually watching the show?     Being the closest case with the hopeless crush on a superior specimen who couldn't care less is suffering.    Praise the potato    Why does Kyoani like to bully gays so much?     Which Hibike have you masturbated to?    spreading gossip about sensei and senpai  Typical band faggot.    It's over /u/ status: destroyed. Now they're just pathetically wishing for an open-ended end and that Kumiko won't show hints that she likes him next episode.    Goto.    Competition piece: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8Tt<wbr>lMmSLJcU</wbr>  [ ]  What do you think /a/?       All dem neets fapping to their shitty oboe waifu   Smh    Like poetry   Flat ass.    "You're favorite anime is shit. SHIIIIT!"   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-km<wbr>y-hm3ai4</wbr>  [ ] (bassoon / fagott)  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=QNB<wbr>sgfh4UMY</wbr>  [ ] (oboe)  For people like me that don't actually know what different instruments sound like.       I'm honestly bewildered by these comments.    /u/ is awful.    Why? All of those posts are accurate.    After seeing how Reina acted towards Kumiko when she heard she was alone with Taki-Sensei, you would have to be completely insane to believe she has any romantic interest in anyone besides Taki-Sensei.  Even if they made a yuri bait scene ten times as pandering as the episode 11 one, it still won't mean even an "open end", since the only way they could make it more clear that Reina wants Taki D is by having her fuck table-kun while looking at a picture of Taki-Sensei.      I should have waited for next week. MIDI is just so awful it doesn't do justice to actual playing. I think it will be great though.    Reina.    You misunderstood that scene. Reina was actually jealous that Kumiko was alone with a man at night.  Based KyoAni knows how to keep the bait ambiguous, just like Reina's weird face in episode 5.      Why must all threads be like this? Can you just appreciate a nice pair? I'm not even a yuri-fag but Reniaxkumiko is cute, and honesty it would of been fine if it went childhood friend route,   But God damn, just enjoy it, you can't look anyone in the eye and honestly claim yuri-bait after episode 11       Sorry, I refuse to believe these are genuine opinions of rational people.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Pcn<wbr>BIGMRdHs</wbr>  [ ]   That looks quite tasty.   I'm going to marry Kumiko!     What's the point of those shows?    Of course you are, Reina.    I'm going to marry Natsuki!        Shuichi's worst nightmare. Or maybe his dream, I don't know.    How can it be his if she's only had sex with Reina?    Reina never acted jealous over Kumiko. She sperged out several times when Taki-Sensei was mentioned. She only freaked out after she heard Taki's name mentioned. There was nothing ambigous here.   Episode 11 scene was explained as a continuation of episode 8 banter a billion times already. Look at how Kumiko and Reina acted in these past five episodes outside of those scenes. They acted as friends. Kumiko was weirded out by Reina's confession for Taki, not jealous or heartbroken. If ep11 was Kumiko returning Reina's love, why did they act as friends and not partners in episode 12?       Because it gets annoying to hear people repeatedly claim Kyoani will purposely change the pairing in an adaptation. Never mind the fact that the current volume has zero romantic development, never mind that Kyoani has been very faithful in their adaptations, never mind that changing the pairing while still only on volume 1 of 4 is momentally stupid, it just gets annoying when the only reason anyone actually wants the lesbian pairing isn't because it's progressive or part of their character development, but because they just want to see two girls getting it on.    I mean the reason about what she realized in middle school. Did you actually finish reading my post?     Get good you fucking scrub.    Again, you misunderstood. Reina freaked out because she didn't want Kumiko to be with a man. She had the same reaction in episodes 5 and 8 (regarding Shuuichi in the latter).  Her "rabu" is actually just admiration for Taki-sensei, and her "ai no kokuhaku" is true homosexual love for Kumiko. Also, partners do act like friends, they aren't lovey-dovey all the time.  All of this was planned out very carefully by KyoAni. They'll bait everyone until the end, and they'll never make another season or movie.         would of   Learn2english       Kyoani has been very faithful in their adaptations  Heh. Also Anon, have you read the novels, or at least the one this season is based on? Because I imagine it would help you form your opinion on this matter.   but because they just want to see two girls getting it on.  When has this been the case ever?          this level of desperate /u/ damage control   Keep 'em coming, just keep 'em coming     I love the track at 4:03, what's the title called?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?t=11&amp;<wbr>v=YHYWAXFvs0Q</wbr>  [ ]  Also, slightly pressured Red Ribbons is also good.      So does the /u/ camp of /a/ have it this crazy compared to other places? I'm tempted to peek at other forums to see how they feel about the yuri teasing in it all.  Fuck it. Let's see what I can find.      you can't look anyone in the eye and honestly claim yuri-bait after episode 11   I'm not even a yuri-fag  Stop lying and fuck off        No versions of playing bad    FUCKING KYOANI YOU BETTER GIVE ME A S2/MOVIE OR ELSE I'LL FUCKING KILL MYSELF I'M FUCKING SERIOUS HERE   Damn you are hairy.    Other forums pretty much unanimously support the yuri. Only /a/ has these unruly hetfags, perhaps because they spill over from the SJW backlash on /v/.    That fig is so shitty   Which section would you join and why?   How can you wear those fucking dirty shoes? Are you literally poor or 16 years old?     Wearing shoes inside the house  Pls.     Hibike yurifags are far more dominant in other forums, since it's seen as "progressive" to demand a lesbian pairing in the name of "queer representation" and all that jazz. Anybody who disagrees too vehemently can be easily bludgeoned into submission and/or silence by accusations of homophobia. Basically, if you want a straight pairing and visit any other forum, you just don't dare to speak up for fear of social repercussions. /a/ doesn't have this problem, of course, since everybody is anonymous, can say whatever he likes and generally doesn't give a shit about other people. Which is why /a/ is and always has been superior to other forums, no matter how much shitflinging goes on around here.    Reina is actually yelling at Shoe1 for talking about Taki-sensei.  Here's the full image.      Double reeds. I'd slowly come between Kurumi and the other fagott until after graduation at which point Kurumi and I would go to the same college and right fagott would be forgotten forever.     Wanna make "music together" with Reina and me?     Do you also go into the basement to laugh?    yeah good try, but it's easy to see your pic is photoshopped  just compare shuuichi's mouth to the one in OP's image      /u/fags are hilarious    THIS IS NO JOKE     6 days until this.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rBM<wbr>E62reb5Y#t=54</wbr>  [ ]    Is Drills-chanXTromboner-kun the best kyoani romance ever?    Asuka and Haruka holding hands     Suddenly, del/u/sional NTR.    Yep.    Picollo player at 2:06 and drum-chan can both get it   So how is /u/ reacting to the third time Reina has been confirmed straight and Kumiko not seeming to care at all?    still using hetfag unironically  kill /u/rself      dat twintail unrequired love  based KyoAni     What's Sensei thinking?      You beast. That would never, ever happen.    Euphoric!    Why is Taki there? What are you thinking sensei?    What else would one call the people wanting yuri to lose?    What am I looking at?    I know I'm probably a moron for taking this post seriously, but it's not like I have anything better to do. And some people do seem to believe this.   Reina freaked out because she didn't want Kumiko to be with a man.   She freaked out specifically after hearing Taki-Sensei's name, and started ignoring everything Kumiko was babbling about. It wasn't the man part, or the alone part, it was Taki part. She has never shown a reaction this serious towards anything non-Taki related. Compare all the other reactions Reina had towards people talking about Taki-Sensei.   She had the same reaction in episodes 5 and 8 (regarding Shuuichi in the latter).  Episode 5 scene was, again, about Taki-Sensei. Smiling about Shuichi in episode 8 was indicative of her sharing the same opinion Hazuki does - that Kumiko is in love with Shuichi and in denial of her feelings. They've known each other since middle school, after all.   Her "rabu" is actually just admiration for Taki-sensei, and her "ai no kokuhaku" is true homosexual love for Kumiko.  "Ai no kokuhaku" line is straight from the novels. Where they're platonic friends. It's just chuuni talk. The idea that rabu was just admiration is nonsensical, she literally pointed out and clarified her stance. She is in romantic love with him. If it was just admiration, it would not have been done this way.   Also, partners do act like friends, they aren't lovey-dovey all the time.  They weren't lovey-dovey even once. They weren't lovey-dovey in private, when there was no one around them. They acted just as friends. And this was shortly after they supposedly confessed to each other. There would have been a lot more nervousness and romantic tension - and there was literally none. You don't act like friends when you're all alone with your first teenage love the very next day after you confess to each other. Even their private talk was one-upmanship - if you become special I'll become even more special. No mention of being special together.                Two beautiful 18 year old girls holding hands?  As the ancient Hawaiians used to say, time for a dicking!      Maybe some people here actually like the het couples for themselves, and not as a reaction to the SJWs?     They never even spoken to each other.     I play euphonium so I'd join them.     seriously responding to a troll post     it literally reads in the description, step it up anon, Ishiki no Houga   19.意識の萌芽       Anon, you high?    I'm literally 99.99% sure it's a troll post but then I see something like  and I'm not so sure anymore.  I can only imagine how awful it must be on other sites if  and  are even remotely true. I'd like to believe they aren't.      whatever, straightfags or even normies, but not /u/r fucking imported tumblr lingo  if you wanna talk about how much "het" disgusts you, there's a perfectly shitty site called tumblr readily available to /u/      It's tame compared to here. That is, if one isn't an idiot for not realizing it's mostly shitposters stirring trouble here.     Don't waste your time man   I want to marry this person.   Reina, please.    Kumiko please.    Go back to practice, Reina    Hazuki and Sapphire listed as main characters   Even less screentime than several side characters  When will they get their revenge?    I'm glad Natsuki has taken up the banter mantle now that Kumiko has deserted her post.    Thanks, tovarisch.      When the Battle Royale begins on stage.    WHAT      trips for truth, the NTR is real    In their spinoff series    luscious lips     Fuck you Kyoani, where's my beach episode?   OVA    Sensei takes them to beach to relax after the competition.    what a relentless bitch    Please don't insult the happy couple.      I fucking wish   Reina x Kumiko   Give me your crack pairings        Book 2 had a pool scene. We'll just have to wait for s2.  So, never.    I want to break Reina's heart.   Despite her appearances she looks like the sensitive type.    So now /u/ fags settle for crack pairing RibbonNatsuki?      People still caring about Reina/Kumiko when Ribbons/Natsuki is the hottest shit around.       She looks like yandere. After she realized that Kumiko NTRed her, she will probably cut off Taki's head and show it to Kumiko.    What is she doing?   She's just asking to be raped and impregnated.   Keep that ribbon slut away from my 10/10 qt    Why not? Is it disrupting your "I want to fuck Natsuki" shitposting?   Who /fuck kumiko/ here? not Shitichi, that's for sure.   Delicious sailor Taki.    NO    Situation is still salvageable.   <br/>     only 1 knife   Pleb. High-tier yanderes duel wield.       Shoeitchy is such a pathetic little shit, that's for sure. Wants to go out with Kumiko, but then he's never there for her when she's having trouble and could need some emotional support. Fuck him. I'm glad he's getting NTR'd by Taki, he deserves it.     implying it was an unrequited love  They have hot hot drill sex every night     *dual        anti/u/ autists still mad at another board   Still obsessed enough to go to a board they hate about a subject they hate and whine about the users being disappointed in the lack of the subject they like in a show with pandering for that subject.   This is like going to /v/ when they still had anime threads and obsessively screenshotting their reactions to whatever shounen shit they like at the time.  What the fuck is wrong with you          I'd like you to remember that /u/fags started that retarded war when they flooded /a/ with their "hetfag BTFO" shit after episode 8 had aired. They deserve all backlash they receive.   inb4 b-but that was just falseflagging I swear        Still obsessed about shitposting that happened weeks ago.   Get the fuck over it and stop being obsessed with /u/ you autismal fuck       The only way /a/ opens up to Rbbons is, her walking the yuri path.      fuck  You don't fuck the Kumiko, you make passionate love to her.      B-but they're the one who started this REEEEEEE      they started it!    this shit again   this shit AGAIN        They talk about the show and what they think of the KumikoxReina ship. The Seyuu of Kumiko said they like each other, or more like that's what she thinks.   I thought the guy in the trumpet section didn't pass the audition.   Hetfags are still mad they got trolled by people pretending to be yurifags in Love Lab threads.   MidoriXmelonpan OTP.  Quite certain Kindergarteners aren't allowed here.   Every boy in the band made the audition because they're not slackers.    Because she's usually a huge bitch but gets flustered when Natsuki is around   ALL THESE REINA JELLY over Kumiko spending time alone with Taki. Hahahaha    I'm a fan of yuri and I even post on /u/ from time to time. Not too often, I made maybe 10, 15 posts there in the last month, and only like two of those were in /u/ H!E threads, so it's not like I only post there because of this anime.  You don't need to be a yurihater to think that the idea of an anime original yuri end at this point is beyond absurd and want to know how can people still hope for it.   Those are just shitposters, idiot. People who know you get easily upset over yuri since you associate with SJW/tumblr/whatever and act obnoxiously to make you dislike yuri fans even more. Then people like you start shitting on yuri fans, and the legitimate yuri fans get upset and start shitting on your kind, and then it's a vicious cycle of shitposting. If you didn't fall for the bait none of this would happen. The original shitposters will just get bored and move on to a different target.  Also, it's stupid to equate between /u/ and /a/ yuri fans. Most /a/ yuri fans seem to utterly despise /u/ because of the Western content there, and most /u/ posters think of /a/ being almost as bad as /v/ these days and avoid this board like a plague.           Hetfag BTFO was clearly /sp/ posters funposting.    Reina more like REEEEEEEEEEEina, amirite fellas?    I swear they're probably women because only a scorned woman would still be mad over shit that happened almost two years ago   Why the fuck are you obsessively taking screenshots then? There's no point other than to stir shit. Their opinions are honestly irrelevant and not worth mentioning in the long run.   So some fucks on another board has hope for another outcome for the show and it's likely that some of those fucks don't even post here?  Who cares            "y-you wanna smell my armpits? why?"      because of the Western content there  Interesting, I remember that when I stopped going to /u/ a few years ago, there was a lot of shitflinging over Western content being allowed or not. So that's where the scales fell.      Natsuki stuttering   You don't watch this show, do you?      Yurifaggots tend not to give a shit about personalities when it comes to their shipping.    This.  I find it funny than no one on /u/ actually gave a damn about Love Lab after learning the premise and checking the manga, but on /a/ threads had so many shitposters whining why it's not full yuri etc. all the time.  And seeing /u/ board posts about this Hibike show and then checking /a/ threads, the only correct conclusion is that /a/ trolls itself with phantom yurifags, once playing the role of them and then doing reverse and scorning them.       Both /u/fags and hetfags are cancer.   Musicbros  are where it's at. We won this episode, boys!      Tell the mod moot create /lgbt/ for a reason.     Not really. That one pixiv faggot prove otherwise.     natsukifags   yurifags     How to troll anti/u/fags  Pick two girls that seem really close together. The more prominent, the better.  When they have a good moment alone together that has the slightest hint of romanticism  Shitpost with "hetfags btfo" or any variant. Spread rumors about the production team changing shit if it's an adaptation.  Sit back and let the salt flow   There wasn't even any yuri posting in that post anon              You still get people bitching about it from time to time, but it only happens in non-Western threads when someone mentions something Western (e.g. Korra being a "/u/ victory"), people don't tell people making threads about Western content to kill themselves anymore, like in the good old days.  moot really should have made a NSFW /co/ instead of allowing Western content on /u/.      I thought he created that board only to see /pol/ being angry    You mean the picture of the samurai being upset about Love Lab not being yuri?  I think that was made on 2chan and translated by /u/   It's a tranny containment board, not a board to discuss media          Shitposting from both sides always bring salt. /u/ or het.   All of them are the same salty shitbags.       hetfags   straightfags   het   straight   fags        One of the reasons why this episode was my favorite was because of how it hit so close to home. I fucking love music so damn much.     moot really should have made a NSFW /co/ instead of allowing Western content on /u/.  But msot of western content on /u/ is not neven NSFW, you get info about movies, tv shows, games, literature, comics, add to that the usual anime and manga yuri subtext threads from non-yuri shows, and as cherry on top we finally get some real japanese origin yuri either in anime/manga/hentai form.  And to be honest western content keeps the /u/ board active a bit more than having all the time the same repost image threads.  I don't mind too much cause I actually like to follow everything lesbian/bisexual related in one place.        ナイスメメ！！  http://www.kyotoanimation.co.jp/eve<wbr>nt/ax2015/   only one merch for Hibike   Even that i doubt that would sell much compared to Free! stuff that obviously sold like hotcakes.  The land of Freedom citizens loves Free!     </wbr>  I can't wait for their next interaction.   イツライクポエツリ     I can't wait for the millions of landwhales to flood the place.     going to the nurse's office for a fucking nosebleed     I really wish Shuichi crossed the street letting hetfags feel some form of hope then gets absolutely crushed by a bus, crushing their dreams.  The salty tears will be delicious! Alas, can't have them all.        all that Free shit  Absolutely disgusting.      no Natsuki  Why even bother      only character specific merch is of Makoto  Heh     pottery right here    Woah, hey you okay there buddy? Sounding a little miffed perhaps? Try not to be cut on your edge though, it's bad for your health.       he pays for things  Look at this retard.      Stay bitter yurifag. Stay bitter.    I want to date her.    hetfags  Whoever coined this term is retarded.      KyoAni makes the most delicious girls you'd want to hatefuck.      hatefuck   hate      We could be losers together,     It's for fucking the bitch out of her, anon. A purification method to cleanse the evil inside of her.      It means fucking them to appease your sexual desires all the while you still show disdain towards them.  Take this other hate-fuckable girl for example.       But Shinka is best girl.   Why is she so smug?    But msot of western content on /u/ is not neven NSFW, you get info about movies,   Yes, that's how it is right now. But when it first started, it was different. At first, Western content wasn't allowed. Then after some point, you only had a "containment" thread for all Western content (I don't think the term general thread existed yet), and over time it spread more and more to the way it is today. So this wouldn't have happened if the first step was not taken since there was an alternative board for that Western content.  At least that's how I remember it, I could be wrong.    And to be honest western content keeps the /u/ board active a bit more than having all the time the same repost image threads.  I've always disliked this argument. Not every board needs to be a fast one. It's okay to have slow boards. There are plenty of boards that are much slower than /u/. And for people who are interested in yuri content only, the Western content is not a positive at all.   I don't mind too much cause I actually like to follow everything lesbian/bisexual related in one place.  Fair enough, but look at it from the other point of view. If the boards were separated, you would just need to open two tabs. It makes no real difference to you. But people who don't want Western content and only want yuri content don't have that option. Numerous /u/ threads, the ones not dedicated to specific pairing/franchise (e.g. ones dedicated to a specific sexual act), often have both yuri and Western content posted in them. For people who don't like Western content, that's annoying.             Oh god, imagine the two of the alone and they start to banter and things then turn slightly physical and one of them accidentally trips over and the other one goes down too and they are then facing each other and they start to blush and get all tsundere.    So basically Dekomori and Nibutani?    no, Natsuki and Ribbons are much better because its nowhere as forced as they are and Natsuki is best girl.     Natsuki is Asuka's property.     Shimakaze plz    Contrabass because I play the bass and I suck at wind instruments    wat?       how do I into developing my own opinion    Thank you based KyoAni!        where's asuka   what's she doing    i wish i could see her    will this band bullshit took long to end   i wanna hang out with asuka    which panties is she possible wearing today            Actually she doesn't. She is a horrible character, quite retarded and useless.   Is Reina going to stab Kumiko with a kitchen knife?   Either trying too hard or really, really new.    I had a dream about Kaori and Asuka making out last night.     this THIS new      master1200.jpg   there are people this new here   I guess only night threads are remotely enjoyable safe from all those crossboarders.      Kumiko's reaction to being cut from practice was great.   Yeah. I especially liked how they showed everyone else's reactions first.    1 week for the next and last episode    Don't forget her shitty character design.    The face of KyoAnus lickers, everyone      it's the last episode   It better be fucking good.       I haven't seen many good final episodes the past few years.    I CANT FUCKING WAIT FOR THIS HET VS YURI STRESS TO FINALLY END     Shinka   Not the bro to end all bros      I'm sad as fuck already, I wish it wouldn't end ;_;     it's time   Thank god this faggot is rotting in jail.     hating shinka  What a loser.     You know the full 12 minutes will be devoted to then playing the music. Whether or not it will be good depends on how much you love music.    That's because anime are no longer made with an actual ending in mind. They have become marketing tools for shitty light novels.   So I just looked at the /u/ thread for this show and they seem resigned to the fact that /u/ isn't actually happening.  Why has /a/ led me to believe that they are all delusional shipperfags that try and deny everything hetero in the series?  The people from /u/ that post here seem way more delusional than the people actually posting on /u/.       Why  why are Kamigawa cards so bad      Trombone master race fucking get at me faggots    If Kumiko fucking talks over it the whole time I swear to god    /u/ is full of broken hearts, trampled by the world  here we have bright-eyed dreamers      Pride anon, they've come this far, backing off at this point will hurt their pride and they'll feel like bunch of losers.       the most 4chan series of replies ever       She'll never know that Shuichi shit talked her behind her back.   What's Kumiko thinking of?  How does she read the sheet music?   lelouch pls    With her eyes.    She kinda has to, otherwise it will literally be 12 minutes of nothing but music, and we're getting those for the OST. She'll probably introspect at a few points with an occasional 'wow, they're good' from the audience so non-music watchers wouldn't get too bored.    Why don't they put music on tablets and have it move automatically over time?    It's pretty fucking obvious to anyone with half a brain that there won't be any conclusive romantic ending. Shuichi only ends up with Kumiko at the end of the very last novel, so a het end for s1 was literally impossible from the very beginning. Kyoani know that they will never get to animate all the novels, so they cut out most of Shuichi's romantic development and replaced it with more Reina and Kumiko scenes.   This was never a romance show, it was a SoL music anime with yuri fanservice.      I've checked there a few times for different shows and each time they are predominately cautiously optimistic to pessimistic.    /u/ is actual lesbians, the yurifags on /a/ are the male equivalent of fujoshi    Tablets are expensive and are harder to replace, dust.    Contrabass because wind instruments are pure shit.    Is this the narrative the hardcore hetfags are going for once the finale aired? No one is expecting a full blown yuri end, literally no one. We have enjoyed a show full of quality yuri fanservice and that's it. We won because we enjoyed this show whereis you hated every moment Reina and Kumiko shared screentime together and all you were clinging to this whole time were novel spoilers of the very last volume, which will never be animated.     Kyoani know that they will never get to animate all the novels  Why do so many people believe they can see the future? Is the concept of conditionality nonexistent to them?     /lgbt/ are the real lesbians, /u/ are imaginary lesbians.    I feel like Ruby or whatever the hell is her name never talked to anyone outside of Kumiko.    Says the Anon who has been to neither board.    She was betrayed by Ribbondas Iscariot.    In the history of their studio, Kyoani have never animated more than 2 seasons of one anime. Even moneycows like Haruhi or K-On didn't get a 3rd one.   reina please   1 week  until they next show for fall season.     Hey, thanks for telling me shit I already knew, but it might be helpful to know that that has nothing to do with this show.   Rewatch this scene give me a very difference feeling.  Asuka sure is the master of acting.     fuck    Look at that chuuni bitch.   So when's Shuumai going to win the Kumiko-bowl    The people from /u/ that post here  Holy shit you're a gullible fagott if you actually believe the '/u/' posts you see here are actually from /u/.     didn't haruhi's author have a writer's block and k-on manga guy ran out of ideas?    Are you stupid or something? The fact that Kyoani have never done a 3rd season of an anime before is kind of a strong indication that they will not animate 4 seasons of this one.    She doesn't care.     Super special.     Good to know you were as dumb as I thought.  First of all, the last book is just side stories. Some of which have already been hinted at this season. An entire season for it is completely unnecessary.  Secondly, the next two books can be done in a 2 cour second season, or a 1 cour second season and a movie, or whatever. Both of which KyoAni's already done.  And lastly, yeah I know it's incredibly unlikely, but just because they haven't before doesn't mean KyoAni CAN'T do 3 fucking seasons of a show. Nothing is stopping them besides what fan think they do. But should a continuation happen, the former two possibilities are more likely.  And lastly, you do know that with its sequel, Clannad is essentially 4 cour, right?          From sleepychan to best girl   Someone please explain the point of posts like these to me.   Couldn't handle the banter.   Whoa, anon.  Free S3 is still possible, if you mean that      To annoyed the fuck out of your autisic mind?    I loved that scene.    Ayy lmao.    Better than "lolol Hetfag BTFO" or "I hate /u/ they are shit" shouting out of nowhere.   Guys... I don't what anime to watch. If I don't watch anime I feel lonely... Some good action/romance anime?   We wait for summary anon  Link for those who missed last thread <br/>     Here we go again, shitpost thread.    Strictly speaking, they're supposed to get him excited. The other girls are using date tactics (except Origami, lol drugs) while Yamai went straight for the dick.   Reminder to ignore the bait posters.    Same 12 IP's   Samefagging with the same IP number trying to save this shit too hard      Hoping the new Spirit from the upcoming movie will be canon and make it to the main story in the LN. She's too much of a seemingly kuudere loli qt to pass up.   So since Toriyama confirmed GT is canon because of multiverse What are the odds of Goku from GT universe meeting up with Goku from God universe? Maybe teaming up to beat Shapna, who is the GT universe Beerus?     double goku fusion dance.  you heard it here first.     when did he ever say it was canon?  I doubt they'll connect GT universe with DB universe. It would be just dumb and unnecessary.   The new Dragon Ball Super villains will be some fat dude who looks exactly like Beerrus and female Whis.     zero chance    I'm hoping for it honestly anon Come on two Goku's what could be more awesome then that.     Yeah the fat Beerus his name is Shanpa   God, can you imagine if the new series really did cross dimensions and Goku would meet other versions of himself?  Then the entire Z fighter team would just be Goku. Not even Vegeta would be of any use against the big bads, just a bunch of Gokus buying time for Goku while he powers up or whatever.    SSJ4 Goku   Fuses with SSG goku   this fusion goes on to fusing with SSJGSSJ Goku fused with SSJGSSJ Vegeta       Vegeta's face when     Double goku fuses with another double goku?    This.    take 7 gokus   make all go SSG   then make all them go SSG2   SSG3   SSG4   SSG5   etc etc   Goku is demonbane now           If there is a Goku in each universe that means at least 12 Gokus You could fuse 6 fusions of 2 Gokus     In one universe, Nappa is alive  In another, Yamcha and Bulma had kids      Thanks to a plot device, any counterpart not in his or her world is only peak human strong at most.     So since Toriyama confirmed GT is canon because of multiverse  By that logic every reddit fanfic is canon because of multiverse       in one universe, Yamcha is the ultimate fighter      Or they can only stay for very short periods of time and using power makes it shorter     gt is canon  Source: your ass?      Toriyama actually doing anything creative in 20 years  There's no time , anon, gotta keep churning out new transformations and fan service movies.    http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?featur<wbr>e=player_detailpage&amp;v=BgO9qhw1FvY#t<wbr>=181</wbr></wbr>  [ ]   DAN DAN KOKORO HIKARETEKU   If you want multiple universes and more goku's and vegeta's go read DB Multiverse. Free comic on their website.   Source?    The opening and endings were the only good thing to come out of GT. And then the dub goes and replaces it with   GRAND TOUR       DB Multiverse online moe 7+  10/10     GT is canon     Multiverse again.   <br/>   yfw in one of the various universes Cell beats Gohan and unlocks his true potential    In 1 of 12 universes it is    there is an universe where Gohan isn't shit   In one universe Kami never came to Earth so Goku was killed by Raditz and Earth was destroyed.    Are there more of these?    Big bang kamehameha when?   There´s 1051 pages of fan-comic.      Guys, infinite possibilities only means possibilities. If something is impossible, then it won't happen even if you have a universe for each possibility.        So since Toriyama confirmed GT is canon because of multiverse   The best way to start a bait thread, OP.  In any case, GT is not canon and they won't implement it in Super.  What people have been saying is that is a side story that can be considered an alternate universe because of the revelation of the multiverse.            In that same universe Kami was still on Namek at full power and defeated and killed Freezer when he arrived    Omega Shenron wasn't that bad for the pile of shit GT was. I liked the idea of the dragon balls having some kind of draw back.     multiverse   he doesnt know what multiverse is     Meanwhile in /a/cademy city   Don't run.   Just let it happen.          I have this classmate she's level 5 and is very good at sports, I think I've fallen for her. How can I get myself to date her?     I'm a level 0 btw       Saten, get the fuck off the internet. If Kuroko finds out about this then you're fucked.  Also stop using the Judgment wi-fi. You're slowing down my torrents.      Ugh, stop arguing or I'll short out your devices.    Life here is kind of rough when your a stage magician. I mean you got children who can do incredible things with there ability. All I can do is separate two rings that are connected to each other  Previously on Academy City....  Accelerator began to bang Last Order. But could do it since she kept say "Misaka Misaka hurts. Misaka Misaka hurts!" Then the darkness of a alleyway, Kamijo tries to stick it into Mikoto Misaka but can't get get it hard due to touching it with his Imagine Breaker. Kuroko rushes in from the dark to strike him down with a trash can.      Man. How long has it been since any update on that anime?   I swear its been like years, if I remember anything past the miserable collection of other moeblob ecchi shit I've had to repress in my head.  Are the producers just not caring anymore?        Stop posting your bullshit online, there will be hell to pay if they see this.    Sauce?    How do you call "controlling water with your mind"?  I need a dude like that to paint my room.      Literally any telekinetic worth shit can control stuff like water, I wouldnt use it to paint a room though, it basically never comes out even    well, i have this unlucky high school level 0 friend but somehow alot of girls seem attracted to him.  I heard he has alot of real magician friends. you should ask him      Real Magicians     Has anyone tried to poison this faggot yet?    You'd have to go around poisoning the coffee in every vending machine, there'd be too much collateral damage. (I'm pretty sure he has never been mentioned eating in the novels, only ever drinking canned coffee)    Telekinesis = Moving with mind Hydrokinesis = Moving water with mind    So...does anyone know where I can find a link to that level upper or... Google isn't giving me any results.   Raid the Windowless building with me.  Some middleschool cunt shorted out my new PFP.  Fucking high levels I swear. You think I can get a refund?   Woke up and found a bunch of stickers with weird letters stuck on the walls outside my apartment. It wasn't Japanese either.   Not just my room too, everyone on my floor had the same thing.  What is going on        Acdemy shitty sucks  This spiky haired faggot punched me out of nowhere because i push some cosplaying nun, because i got irratated.      Dat terminator reference    Where's that Styil guy who yells out for kanzaki?  I'm Aihana Etsu.   That shitty tower blocks my view.     Sure thing bro, I got a couple jackhammers we can use.  We all know that Moot hasn't left us and is just hiding inside that damn building.       Yeah? And I'm Misaka Mikoto, AMA.    who?   Just yesterday, in Seventh Mist, I saw a blond-haired man getting chased by a girl in a tracksuit. Is Academy City this strange?  I was hanging out at a cafe the other day in District 7 when suddenly this fag shows up and starts attacking this girl with a flower headband. He kicked her and dislocated her shoulder and was about to curb stomp her when another guy with white hair showed up by throwing an ATM at her before I got out of there.  How often does this shit happen in D7? I wanted to help her but I'm just a level 1 and my power sucks.   Flower girl if you are reading this I'm sorry that I couldn't do anything       The Roman Catholic Church did nothing wrong. Except Biagio. Biagio did everything wrong.   Time to take out life insurance.   When the fuck are they going to flood the streets again? I missed it this year because I was stuck in the hospital.   I'm hungry   Next year my school gonna win Daihaseisai for sure!   Overaged poster detected.     Pizza    <br/>  How do I get strong /a/? I'm sick of being a shitty level 0.   What? Someone hurt Uiharu?!  That bastard... I'm going to destroy him!     So, are they just going to let the Anglican church slide after what they did to Index with the whole memory wiping/manipulating her?    Call it a Rank 0   Actually outranks angels  Why is this allowed?      Poor Man's Index    Level upper  Some anon before asked the link for it. Does anybody knows?      It's okay, I forgive you. I'm also level 1. If I have more power then I could defend myself. Thank you for your consideration.    Can we meet IRL?      I'am Kihara   Fuck off impostor, a real Kihara wouldn't declare himself a Kihara   ˙uoᴉʇɐsɹǝʌuoɔ ǝɥʇ ƃuᴉʎoɾuǝ ʇsnɾ ɯ,I 'ǝɯ puᴉɯ ʇ,uop   Normally, but for some reason Kamachi uses terms like Elektromaster and Hydrohand.    Since when were australians able to post here?    Since we shitposted Aleister to death.   Guys, on September 30th you're also collapsed for no reason right? It's not just me right?  I'm a level 2, how much can I even do with my ability?    Dunno, probably sleepin there.     get power to time travel, nut can't touch anything   You can train your power and get stronger!   Since we failed last time can we finally group up on that annoying spiky haired dude?  How would power levels work in /a/cademy city, would seeing how much anime and manga you've read and watched be an indication of your strength?   Dude, he's friends with one of the level 5. I've also heard, he basically never lost a fight, no matter howmany he fought. No way I'll fight him.    Power = GUTS!    All of my yes! That dude punched me just because I helped some middle schoolers up! He spouted things like 'Taking her as your prey' what the hell dude!    You're that weird guy with white headband aren't you?   I am Aihana Etsu!   He's just a level 0 so I've heard, what can go wrong?    Nope. Just an ordinary level 0 who saw that guy use that awesome ability. Super Amazing Punch!    Ah, sorry. I thought you're him   does he even know how to use computer?       I recommend you don't fight that idiot. I know him, and he's one of the most powerful people in all of academy city. He can stop Level 5 abilities, like mine.    Woah really?     level 5  Are you trying to doxx yourself?     ...Whoops.    What, has there been an update of S3 for Index?   I heard Tree Diagram was broken. Is this rumor true? How could this happen?  Where my level 3 bros at?   Aleister wont allow his dead.   MISAKA A SHIT A SHIIIIIIIT    W-WHAT?! Why, I oughta...    File a complaint for bullying?   You could say that it *drumroll* has been uprooted.        *action*     B-baka.    I saw him once use a computer via repeatedly punching it with GUTS. I have absolutely no idea why that worked for him.    No, my friend has it covered. She can get in all sorts of places...   If only she wasn't trying to get inside of me!       I don't remember that scene from Fate.   THE SPIKEY HAIRED BOY FINALLY TALKED TO ME   Really? Tell us! Tell us! What did he said to you?!   Guys, I saw this cool guy with a white headband, how can I be as cool as him?  Guys what if we pretend were an imageboard in an anime universe.    Guys what if we pretend were an imageboard in an anime universe: the thread   Ftfy      2025   Not being at least Level 3   Level 4 here, and I seriously pity the lot of you. Researchers are coming to me every other week, asking me if I can aid in their experiments and whatnot. Not only do I feel my powers develop, I get paid handsomely for it as well. A couple years ago I used to be Level 3, but just a few months ago, I was finally reclassified to Level 4 from how much my esper powers grew. If scientists aren't coming to you because you have a common ability, fret not, since there's always volunteer programs you can sign up for, and no matter how common, even a level 1 electromaster can make serious gains if they know where to look.       Meanwhile on duw/a/ng    did anyone else see that giant white beetle ?   Yes. Freaky   Anybody selling dream cards with hot dreams about Misaka? I got some femdom accel ones if anybody wants to trade    Misaka <br/>   Ghost is dead   obviously a typo, I meant Misaki   Ghost is dead   In personality? Sure. But she is a decent pick for hatesex. Just imagine how great it would be to get revenge for all the times she blew up your electronics when you first moved in that surprisingly cheap apartment by a park. In retrospect I should have realized something was wrong i saw a neighbor carting in a portable nuclear reactor to power her floor.      What's going on?      Diaz being a shit as always      Moot rising from the dead to take revenge    found this wat do?    Glad it worked out for you buddy, but being a junior and then a regular researcher I've seen too many of your types burn like candles trying to overcome themselves. After some time you just stop caring, true, but it's a friggin pyramid and not everyone has what it takes to get on top. Be it stress consequences or side effect, I actually rarely see a high-level without an issue of some sorts, subconsious phobias and superiority complex being the least of concern, some are plain weirdos.    Ever notice how most lv 0 seem to have no threat analysis skills whatsoever? What's up with that?    Throw an eggs to her and forced her to eat it   Do you think Misaka and Shirai are lesbians? I always see them together   They don't even let gay males work at the school and the girls are banned from even considering getting a boyfriend. The entire place is clearly some kind of experiment intent on creating a lesbian den of debauchery. You can't even try to talk to one of them or return a purse/wallet they dropped without getting attacked by high level espers.   hi i am a level 1 thermal hand how i level up to level 5    2015 in the year of science   still haven't heard of the level upper      can you spoonfeed me a link?    downloadfreemusic.gaku.en  Just search for levelupper.mp3      thanks now i am a level 5 thermal hand  now i can stop the entropy of the universe      he actually fell for it   just like those fake lifehack threads on /b/      I don't have any specific data on that, but what exactly do you mean? If you're talking about them being involved in fights, I guess it's usually just hi-levels being douchebags. That said, I always chuckle when I hear about someone getting punched by that level 0 canceller guy. Quite a subject if you ask me, surprisingly no one I know of is looking into his case especially, but speculations on what sort of power he has are quite intriguing.   How i join Gremlin?   Some of the lv 5 are douchebags but whenever they try to figure out how dangerous the situation they're in is they say stupid stuff like "If a lv 1 isn't that much stronger than us then we just take 5 times as many to beat a lv 5." If they had a plan at least it would make sense but they seem to think they can do it in a fistfight.  Now that I think of it the logic problems aren't just lv 0. That railgun girl for instance can't seem to figure out what his power is when he tells you what it is if you ask him.Instead she goes around stalking/attacking him. It's really creepy.     Was it rape?  why wont she look at him during?  mods, do your fucking job. why do you keep allowing people to spam the same threads everyday, yet delete the good ones that have spoilers and actual discussions?   REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE    But she kissed him back.    Yes.    He still raped her, though.    Wow the art quality is really poor   Yes   when i was raped i kissed my attacker back also. you guys just don't understand the emotions when getting raped.   Kaga is love Kaga is life  I miss the daily prayer anons     Nagato should have gotten all the anime after the war.   towyen pls   meant for     http://pastebin.com/y07u27f1 http://exhentai.org/g/796958/fdc7b9<wbr>c7b4/</wbr>     Eugen is cute but she has too much ass.     I'm not towyen though     Any Nagatofag = towyen.    Danke Danke.   I wonder why.      Translations eventually.   Kaga thread.  Fuck off Kaga. Cranes are so much better.    Is that a new Shiranui-class destroyer? She's wearing the same uniform.    This meme just might be more annoying than Boy Shigure posts.     I still wouldn't say no.    Mai waifu, so happy I married her.    too much ass  Wat.     Nonsense, this is one is just a harmless joke due to something that actually happened in history. I even went and checked the source jpwiki used, though it took a while to find the specific page.    More annoying than Urakaze and Dragons attention whores?    More annoying than Kagafags?   How to make Kaga fall in love with you?   Marry her.    But she won't agree to marry you unless she loved you.    Beat her.    Same way you make Ooi crave for your dick, a ring.   I will post this occasionally until you like her.   You dont, the only thing on her head is Akagi and food.     Kagafags   annoying       Akagi     Shower her with love of course     Fucking slut.... (note: due to the font i can't actually tell what's being said, but it would fit Ushio's response)      Nagamon in charge of new Sakaki in Kantaimanga Daioh    Hell, doesn't lot of people mix up Yuugumo-class as KagePro-class?        Stalker     Noshiro-class was also something that happened historically.    The only words I can make out are "摆么," which means "showing off" or "putting out," and given the circumstances and Ushio's response, it seems like Wo is accusing Ushio of being immodest.  Hence "fucking slut."      Oh I thought that said Ushio was saying fucking slut.    Does she have Japanese cold? That's kinda life threatening.    Well, but it won't happen, unfortunately    Kaga is always hot.    The OP really wants to kill her    tfw your destroyer turns into a Toyota     orig.jpg  Is getting caught part of the plan?     Fubuki technical when?    I bet thats from the Suprafag on twitter.      She's adoirable    Could be worse.    What a hot TTK    that's anti-canon    Kaga-san?    That's not Kongou, nigga   How should Kaga die?   Of old age in her sleep, presumably surrounded by loving family.    Before or after her husband?    With.    What if they don't have children? Who is going to bury them then?      Why do they give a shit? They're dead.    Mutsu's a pretty good girl too.      Why would you marry Kaga and not get her pregnant? Would you buy an onahole and never finish inside of it?    Nagato is a failure of a secretary ship.    Because War.    What is it good for?  dead boats       boats     I heard you talkin shit about my waifu.    He's not wrong, I sink subs all the time.    Hey, are you Wo, Northern Hime, or Compass Fairy?    reacting to the wrong aspect of the joke     still reacting wrong             Poi    Ultra-Light Carrier     I can't think of a way to reference Yuka Ootsubo in this.      I want Hayashibara Megumi ship.      Shot in cold blood by her best friends.       Resevoir Ship   Directed by Quintin Tanakano "the P"  I'm okay with this         Atago / Nagato / Takao super-dreadnought tits  Those are not okay. Big but not huge is the right size for her.      Nagato  Nagato's not that big.     http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/151<wbr>0864</wbr>    I guess it depends on the artist.    I don't understand Yamato's swimsuit but I love it      Daijoubu!    Mmmmmmmhhhmmmmm    Me too.     the red is blood    Draw a 46cm triple mount with Yoshinori.  DDs are love DDs are life    I mean, rewrite Resevoir Dogs scenario with Midway campaign ships.  I think I just thought up of a great doujin idea.      What's going on here?     That's the typical Irishman for you.     No it isn't, read her marriage lines.       445   close but no     I wasn't even trying. I only read the post right after I posted .   Post a girl who you think doesn't have married fanart, and it is up to others to post said fanart and post another girl they think doesn't have married fanart.  I'll start with Yamagumo.     Why do you have to start with the hardest one?    Arare.    Game over, anon.   I want to marry nee-san!   Well I guess this counts.    Just say you want Yamagumo married art.   STALKER if you're here, can you please typeset http://danbooru.donmai.us/pools/100<wbr>60 http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=50709518 It has Kaminari. </wbr> </wbr>    No ring.    Too bad she has an explosive temper.      It was either her or Nowaki. I couldn't think of anyone else.

Remove her legs and it's a deal.      Her hat isn't even that kawaii    THANK YOU KAWAII HAT   <br/>   dat Dio Brando kiss    People with taste? Im surprised. Next one should be Ooboro.  Im still waiting for that Taigei version, also thank you kawaii hat.         marrying Yamagumo     Oboro  There's quite a bit of married Oboro, actually. She isn't that obscure.      How about Mikazuki?    She's relevant for being irrelevant.    Yeah I kind of guessed that, after all her desdiv is quite popular.  That looks like a tough one, I know a Kikuzukifag, but never ever seen a Mikazuki one, even if she's cute.        Mikazuki  Too easy, I even chanced upon this one last night.     Post girls you hate. I'll start: Ooi.   You    She's not too bad tbh    If I didn't have favorite already, I'd be stuck between Arare and Mikazuki     Kongo     Refrain    But I'm not a little girl. Though I wish I could be.    Who?    Kongou        Kaga     Kancolle      &gt;small c      Don't think too hard about it. You already said her name.      &gt;not CFGC     Well, now. I see.    Rude.    I guess I cant win agaisnt autism. Kinu should be next i guess.  kaga, ooi, akebono.      Ooi    Ro &gt; Yuu    Yeap, it's me, resident Whofag.   Germans are too cute sometimes       There's nothing autistic about love. Shit taste by the way.    USS Johnston shipgirl of the year all years   I wasnt talking about loving them, but finding the pictures. Also show me yours shitlord.    best hotel class simply because she isn't hiding her real chest size.     Why is she brown if her sister is not?  Was their father a cuck?     She was painted black before Leyte.     Why did she job to a bunch of carrier escorts and destroyers?      Yuura     Because no air cover.     Yuura    Now that I think about it, I'm kind of surprised Yukikaze doesn't have a larger role in any of the other media.   I wonder why that is.     Yura.    Because she only brings death to her own fleet.    She brings bad luck to everyone else.    Somehow I get the feeling that you just drew it and posted it here. Hmm, Wakaba.   yfw Shinano by Huke        Yura is surprisingly popular, actually.     Shittiest hotel because she looks like shit. Godawful character design.    hating Ooi  There is only one man responsible for this.    She's like a CL version of Shigure,of course she is  I still se her hair as white .    Thanks for the translation, Prinz a cute.      One's good luck should not constitute the causing of bad luck.      Saw this a few weeks back. She's not too obscure either.   I'm no artist.   Wakaba  Hold on.          Nevertheless it happens.    not knowing about Yura's war history    wheredoyouthinkyouare.jpg    Who is this? New event ship?    It did during the war whenever Shigure, Yukikaze, and Zuikaku sortied.    I probably laughed more than I should have when a Yukikaze hit my Yamashiro to red in one hit in PVP.   Kaga literally has the perfect personality to be a wife and mother.   She had good luck, but she also caused everyone around her to have bad luck.  Even 53 luck Hatsushimo suffered. I figure that if Shigure and Zuikaku had sortied with her together they'd have sunk within a year or two.      You're baiting the faggot from the previous thread, aren't you?    How so?    She's the type of girl you can live your whole life with, and not get "bored" within a few months, or want to kill yourself because she's annoying.    Which lines suggest that?    But Kaga is boring as fuck.     This one is really cute, should I dump it here?     At least explian why, I hate her, but Im not an idiot. The replies I got the last thread means that I was spot on.    Kaga is just a Mother's helper.    So you did fall for his bait, how boring.    Fuck, forgot pic.    I know what is he trying, but what else should we discuss then?    Art looks like shit so no.    How about something about a girl you don't hate like a smart individual would do? Or do you really want to shitpost that much? Why don't you make yourself useful and go typeset something?    Which boat u wud fug.     boat     This boat.    She's not the best Musashi, though    Which girls lack married fanart, maybe?     being a fat dirty pedo rapist that mindbreaks Yuu  Absolutely haram.

If you believe hard enough and are willing to waste money and countless hours of your life in a browser game, you can marry all of them. But since shipgirls don't exist, the answer is: none of them. Sorry anon, life is like that sometimes.      Volume 2 Prologue Page 3 Panel 1 The Fight So Far Narration: The newbie Admiral Mizumoto reported to Maizuru Naval District and, together with destroyer Fubuki, set sail for the waters dominated by the Abyss.  Panel 2 Narration: From construction and sorties, they gathered new comrades.  Panel 3 TTK: Nansei Islands Defense Line, captured! * Map 1-4 Fubuki: We've broken through the Sea of the Naval District! * Map 1 * Chapter 7  Panel 4 Narration: Afterward, while completing a quest at that same map, they cried over their first failure.  Panel 5 Narration: Even so, they got Fleet Carrier Akagi from a quest. And when they captured the next map in the Nansei Islands, Bashi Island, they got Fast Battleship Kirishima. * Map 2 and Map 2-3 They steadily built a strong combat force, but...                          Kowan a shit.     her face when you scrap Kitakami for choking too many times in event maps     Kancolle   small c          her face when you scrap Kitakami for choking too many times in event maps  It's so tempting but she's already past mid 90s so I can't bring myself to do it.      Page 4 Panel 1 Narration: With Ooshio's dismantling, they had their first parting experience. They then joined the Autumn [2013] Event...  Panel 2 Narration: "Decisive Battle! Escape Ironbottom Sound!" Title: Anchorage Demon Kuma: Bam kuma!! Narration: The persistence of the shipgirls in battle got us all the way to Lunba Point! * E2  Panel 3 Narration: Sometimes they shipgirls would teach... Blackboard: Regarding Attack Order Narration: Sometimes they would encourage...  Panel 4 TTK: Finally, we've captured it... our first great obstacle, Nansei Islands' Okinoshima! * Map 2-4  Panel 5 Narration: And then, from the two maps they could sortie to afterward, they chose the Northern Seas! * Map 3    small c  Stop trying to push that shit, nobody gives a fuck.                               Whoops, dropped narrative tense there, Panel 2's last line should be "The persistence of the shipgirls in battle got them all the way through Lunba Point!"  Page 5 Panel 1 Maizuru Naval District SFX: Waves  Panel 2 TTK: Slee...py... * said in English  Panel 3 Fubuki: Commander! SFX: Creak Fubuki: Good morning!  Panel 4 TTK: Ah, Fubuki. ...uh, we just captured Okinoshima, so... Fubuki: Today's the day we develop new carrier aircraft for Kaga-san and the rest, you know.  Panel 5 Fubuki: Come on, wake up!! Fubuki: Because everyone's... already preparing!                          I only started giving a fuck when the new wiki started using it in their banner. http://www.kancollewiki.net/  By using it you are embracing the cancer that wiki repesents.      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127098719  The English Wiki button goes to the site you just posted.    /kcg/fag please don't bring your shit here. Next you'll start saying the steam group should be posted here.    Chapter 23 The Admiral and the Carrier-based Aircraft Development Festival  Page 6 Panel 1 Ryuujou: In honor of the capture of the Nansei Islands... * Map 2 Kirishima: Mic OK♡ SFX: Yay, yay Ryuujou: the "Carrier-based Aircraft Development Festival" has begun!  Panel 2 Ryuujou: Progress will be covered by me, Light Carrier Ryuujou, and - Fubuki: I, Fubuki - Jun'you: and me, Jun'you! * deeeeesu  Panel 3 Ryuujou: Fubuki, what do you think about equipment development? (Here you go) Fubuki: Once, around the time Commander only had six shipgirls,  Panel 4 Fubuki: he burnt up all our materials on equipment development. Since then, he hasn't had any passion for development, I think...  Panel 5 Fubuki: But now Commander's level is over 50, isn't it! Sign: Moderator Fubuki: So Commander's making a comeback! SFX: Gulp Ryuujou: Now for the Admiral's debut at the factory!  Panel 6 Ryuujou: Serving as secretary is the one that brought us victory during the capture of Okinoshima, Kaga! Let's give it a shot! * She stops using Kansai-ben for this panel SFX: Cheers Jun'you: Let's go all out! All out! * Battle start line   This wiki doesn't seem as cancerous as the wikia, unless you've got a problem with the tuhu guys hosting it.   Kantai Collection, also known as KanColle   KanColle Wiki Staff  Also note that they use KanColle with an uppercase too right on their front page, so I guess you're fucked buddy.                                             Oh so you're that faggot from /jp/ that keeps getting angry about the new wiki being posted in the OP.    Page 7 Panel 1 SFX: Murmur, murmur Mogami: Heh~♪  Panel 2 Ryuujou: Oh my... this is! A surprise result is stirring up the Naval District! Somehow, somehow, our very first development was... Jun'you: [Loud breath]  Panel 3 Ryuujou: A suuuper powerful, +9 anti-air carrier-based fighter! "Shiden Kai Ni"!! [holy shit] SFX: Tadaa! Jun'you: Hyaha~!!  Panel 4 Ryuujou: Even with a reasonable amount of resources, we succesfully developed way stronger equipment than we expected! SFX: Cheers TTK: Awawawa~ Crab: Awawawawa~ Ryuujou: The Admiral's all worked up!  Panel 5 Akagi: Incredible! Raiden: Clap, clap  Panel 6 Kaga: Akagi-san... Ryuujou: This result has even the serious Kaga smiling!  Panel 7 Ryuujou: Oh, the Admiral's taken a liking to it!! TTK: Let's see... Ryuujou: The Admiral's pushing his luck and continuing with the same resource inputs! He's trying to mass-produce Shiden Kai Ni!  Panel 8 Fubuki: C-commander...  Panel 9 Ryuujou: Fubuki looks on with unease! Jun'you's... drunk too much and is already falling asleep! What're ya doing, Jun'you!? Jun'you: Funya~                                                 The site design on wiki is better in my opinion (don't have to scroll left or right to see all the info in a chart or the quest log) but it needs more people editing. For example Yamashiro does not any of her Kai Ni lines listed on Wiki.     For example Yamashiro does not any of her Kai Ni lines listed on Wiki.  One day I'll learn how to edit wikis.     I kind of want to do it too, but I didnt do anything html based in years, a super basic guide would be helpful.     I'm not /kcg/fag, I think the steam group is just as cancerous. And it turns out that the wikia, while still cancerous, is actually somewhat less so.  Still, if it were up to me wikiwiki would be the only wiki in the OP.    This wiki doesn't seem as cancerous as the wikia  I used to think that way too until they showed their true colours.  http://en.kancollewiki.net/wiki/Kan<wbr>colle_Wiki  small c  </wbr>             Page 8 Panel 2 Ryuujou: That's that!! With about 5000 bauxite used, the Carrier-based Aircraft Development Festival's now over!  Panel 3 Ryuujou: Kaga, what're your thoughts? Kaga: I feel exhilarated. * Paraphrase of equipment line Ryuujou: These are the other carrier-based aircraft we've developed besides the Shiden Kai Ni!  Panel 4 Ryuujou: The Admiral's delighted by the enhancement to our air power! Carrier-based Dive Bomber "Suisei Model 12A" Carrier-based Fighter "Type 52 Zero" Carrier-based Torpedo Bomber "Tenzan" Ryuujou: ...is what I thought, but what's this?  Panel 5 Ryuujou: Why're ya so down?  Panel 6 TTK: If we had these equips back when we were capturing Okinoshima, things could've been so much easier for everyone...  Panel 7 SFX: [Lean over] Jun'you: Admiral, it's all good. TTK: Jun'you...  Panel 8 Jun'you: The carrier-based aircraft we developed today will help us from here on out. Don't forget to be thankful for all the aircraft that fought for us up until now! Jun'you: That'd be fine! TTK: Ju-Jun'you!!  Panel 9 Jun'you: 'cause of that, we should have another equipment development celebration, alright? TTK: Eh!? Ryuujou: Eh... the drunkard's started talking again, so let's end here.  Festival adjourned!   Oh, I have no idea about the site quality, I just noticed the lack of wikia bloat and a comments section.   If you think I support "cancer" because I made a stylistic choice, then so be it.                                                    I can see Kongou marrying an anon     The comments section, while cancerous most of the time, actually helped the wikia during the event; errors in drop lists were quickly corrected. And wikiwiki also has a comment section too.    Page 9 Panel 1 Fubuki: Commander, we're almost at the equipment storage limit. TTK: We'll need to dispose of the excess...  Panel 2 TTK: We've got a bit of excess left over... We can scrap things like the Type 0 Recon Seaplane and 14cm Naval Gun...  Panel 3 KTKM: Eh... Gun scrapping?  Panel 4 TTK: Sorry... KTKM: This elegance...  I guess I got too attached to it, huh... * Bit of a paraphrase of battle start line  Panel 5 KTKM: But, well... when you become obsolete, I guess renewal has it's own elegance. I know! How about -  Panel 6 KTKM: firing a final salute?  Panel 8 TTK: A salute... for the equipment to which we are so indebted! SFX: Ba-boom To be continued  Well shit, now I can't scrap equips without feeling bad either.                                    Shit,  We've got a bit of excess left over...  should be  We've got some spares left over...  I always catch this shit after I post, huh.          This is why I always pastebin my translations.

Sorry, I saw this earlier, but I'm not interested. Too long  and I don't like the art style.        I still don't understand the bottom panels. Does she bad for what she did or is she too afraid of Rensouhou-kun to be her friend?    Alright, thanks you responding.    What Ooipai?    Does she feel bad*    just get a new one!   I like the Harbour Princess. There any decent merch for her in the works?   You sound like a fucking secondary.    No, at least as far as I know.    Afraid.

Because its similar to how I imagine Mikasa looking as a ship girl. Mikasa should be in the game as a stats boosting unit like Akashi or Mamiya. You have Mikasa and you get a boost to your battleships shooting stats. Her role should be fleet gunnery instructor.     Very cute, my wife is beautiful   Kawaii kawaii Murakumo.  I want to tickle Kongou's feet   There are way better Kaga cosplay sets. And I'm not sure why some people going for a full artificial looking style although Kaga would look the best if one looks well Japanese.    Literally only as rapebait.    Even when she is in dere mode.    Micro bikini Murakumo makes me diamond hard.   Hey guys, what is the best software to typeset?     Are there any Fubuki in micro bikini?      Photoshop.

There are regular bikinis that don't make girls look like mega-sluts.        Micro bikinis on flat or small breasted girls don't even look slutty to me, just cute.  On big breasted ones and with skindentation they are another story.      Pity nothing prevents Ooi from looking like a mega-slut.      That image is pretty damn convenient this time.    Fuck, those tits are almost as huge as her head.   I'm not Kaga   You're right.   http://exhentai.org/g/827024/592749<wbr>218d/</wbr>   Is this non-H?    Pixiv's entire population.

Wow, that really does look good on her.    Just what you would expect from the best 特型駆逐艦.     Some eleven actually traveled there and dropped a ring right by Eugen's butt.

What a majestic potato.     boat     Their leader of course.     Kuso secretary ship     Hopefully soon    A ship is only as kuso as the one giving it orders. And it wouldn't hurt if the hotel could diet.    Yes, what are they if not boats?   she's just so perfect   Ships.      I don't like this horrifying implication.   In fact I dislike it so much, that I really have to see more like this      But they're all the same size as an average boat. If they're ships they should be godzilla-sized.    my heart    This is Mikasa.   naka-chan dayo   I wanna marry Kaga!         i am a cute?      hey hey smile Again.      gahahahaha so good        out. You're dangerous chara.     That new Shiranui doujinshi is quite good.      Mah nigga      That's way too cute    She's more tan than Yamato because unlike Yamato, the IJN actually took Musashi out for sorties   big7   Such as?    That's not the correct reason for her being brown.       I want.       I'm just kidding that was bullshit.     http://exhentai.org/g/826981/9d332c<wbr>ac8a/</wbr>     I wish KTKM would choke on my dick instead of choking during events.   Yamato is the best, she got all the anime and manga after the war.   The 4koma isn't the most trustworthy source. The color of Musashi's clothing changes to black when she remodels, like the other camouflaged ships. If her skin color had to do with the camouflage, then she'd start as pale as Yamato and put blackface on. Then again Yamato got the exact same camouflage, it was actually made from her soot, and that's not represented at all, so who knows. Maybe it was just Yoshinori's fetish at the time.

Gakkou Gurashi shit   bruh         comedy, SoL, all girls  Looks like it'll be a great season for me. Also, Prisma.    Is ShindoL a fucking vegan or something?     Thanks guys      FUCK YOUUUUU    The irony...    Look at this faggot, thinking ShindoL is a she.    ShindoL is literally a dude from new york, he has a female assistant he uses to fuck with people.   do you sparkle?   Can she even go into the sun? Besides Ultimate 10, I don't recall any scenes where she was out in the day.     this fat   those disgusting overgrown milk machines  No wonder she's a virgin    No, but I can glow.    The end of 2 and the start of 4 have her outside during the day. Granted, the former was during a rainstorm, while the latter she was bundled up with a hoodie.    Isn't Twilight a dead horse by now?   Pip best boy  after Anderson      How technologically inclined is your waifu? Does she need help using computers? Is she a leading pioneer in her field?   Has your waifu made or repaired anything for you?    I'm going to impregnate Nero! I love my emperor!   I think that New Zealand would be an interesting country to visit.  I used to do fencing. Maybe we could try that out and see what I remember, though she would trounce me quite effortlessly. (I did foil while her fighting style resembles the sabre but I don't think she'd have any problems adapting.)  She's a virgin and has never had a boyfriend, but I'll wager that she knows what she'd need to do for that.  A hug and kiss sounds like a good way to proceed.          I'd hug her and ask how her day went, serve her some tea, give her a massage to relieve her stress, and make sure she's satisfied and relaxed  Question What would be your waifu's ideal vacation?  (Fuuka seems the type of girl who'd love a nice landscape, i imagine taking her some place with lot's of wilderness)         If she's home when I am, I'd greet her with a warm hug and some tender words. Usually depends on how exhausting my day has been.   She seems fond of any place with nice scenery, though she seems especially lively near the ocean. It's part of the reason I'd like to take her on an ocean cruise one of these days.  I've only been on one, and I wouldn't mind giving that same experience to someone close to me.        The size, not really. She may feel bad that they aren't soft though.  Haven't really seen a lot of other stuff she's done, but I like what I've seen. Unsure how popular she is, but she doesn't seem to get many roles.  Not very surprised. She may look like and identify as a girl, but she has turned out to be rather flexible in that regard.  I would hope she wouldn't read them at all. Otherwise I may get really clumsy flirting or awful jokes thrown at me.  Actually, that sounds kinda nice .  I don't think she's ever been to the mountains. Let's go there.  So many things: Playing games. Cuddling.  <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127106709#p127118743">Click here</a> to view the full text.                 </blockquote>]
