Better luck next time  <br> crazy oba-san bleeding to dead approaches you for a sermon </br>  I dunno guys it's going to take a miracle for Hibiki to make it out of this one  <br>Best scene.</br>  <br>Lewd.</br>  <br>Too many times.</br>  <br>About 5 times, unless you count the webm with sound, in which case it's nearing 50.</br>    <br>That scene came right out of nowhere but it was catchy as hell.<br><br>More of that please.</br></br></br>  <br>Hibiki gives love a bad name.</br>  <br>Why doesn't this guy and Genjuro use the Symphogeah like freaking nunchucks Gintama style. They would have saved the world much easier that way.</br>  Which best?  <br>Soon</br>  <br>Carol, she a  miracle </br>    <br>Witch Chino.</br>  I've never watched this but I have to ask<br>how the fuck do people start bleeding out of everywhere on the head and still survive</br>   DID SOMEONE SAY 'MIRACLES'?   <br>REMOVE MIRACLE</br>  <br>It's the phonic gain.</br>  <br> still survive </br>  Counting down the episodes until the obligatory suffering quota is met and HIbiki can recover from her shitty character assassination so we can get back to fisting.  <br><br>Body's got a lot of blood, friend</br></br>  Maria did kill those soldiers back in G, didn't she?  <br> mfw some ugly, smelly Symphoshit in front of me </br>  <br>Who had just showered civilians with bullets</br>  <br><br>Carol, it's past your bedtime.</br></br>  <br><br>Wasn't hard to tell<br><br>In case you haven't noticed fuckloads of people die in this series</br></br></br></br>  <br>Only red shirts, flashback characters, and Mamu, though.</br>  <br>ガリィ、がんばりま～す</br>  <br>They are not dead, the just stole their memories/soul.<br>It's like you never watched Yugioh ZEXAL.</br></br>  <br>Every Hibiki Miku scene is 10/10 I cam buckets.</br>  <br><br>Still a lot for an anime about cute singing lesbians<br><br>Imagine if Saki had this kind of body count every time there was a Mahjong tournament</br></br></br></br>  <br> Cum covered Hibiki? </br>  <br>We need to add Maria and Tsubasa to this and it will be a couch full of jam.</br>  <br>Gary &gt; Micky &gt; Philly &gt; Larry</br>  It's always been red and blue. Whoever heard of pink and blue?  <br>Himouto parody?</br>  <br> Whoever heard of pink and blue? <br>Seriously?</br></br>  <br>Name a pink and blue couple faggot</br>  <br>WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING?</br>  <br><br>I want to put her hat on top of a shelf and look at her attempts at grabbing it even if she barely reaches halfway up.</br></br>  <br>Not him but Yuuna and Tougou are pink and blue methinks, I'm colorblind though. Lots of precure ships are pink and blue too.</br>  <br>I love them all, but Phara is my favorite.</br>  <br> Lots of precure ships are pink and blue too. <br><br>Only the incorrect ones are.</br></br></br>  <br>Carol Malus Dienheim, master alchemist, destroyer of worlds, and the head of the Protect our Children from Miracles movement.</br>  <br> Mana and Rikka <br> incorrect <br> Working against myself since I'm the red and blue fag but oh well </br></br></br>  <br>The face of evil</br>  <br>There's Anthy and Utena too.</br>  Would you show her your  little  miracle, anons?  <br>Regina is better.</br>  <br> Mana and Rikka <br>  </br></br>  <br>I want to  steal her shoe and run off with it. </br>  <br>all are best</br>  So, we all agree that Garrie will probably usurp Carol's place as the main antagonist sooner or latter, right?<br>She seems really shady and can cast illusions + has some control over memories.</br>  <br>Anthy is purple, pink an purple are always together.</br>  <br>How did he spin a car like that?</br>  Cute girls with shark teeth do weird things to my dick.  <br>If Carol doesn't know to put failsafes in place then she has it coming.<br><br>I can't see much motivation for any of the Autoscorers to act against her yet, though.</br></br></br>  <br>She seems the most likely to be the one playing Carol like a fiddle. Which is why i don't think she'll be the main villain, it just seems to obvious.</br>  <br><br>Watching Bruce Willis films with Sempai</br></br>  This expression is adorable  BIFU SUTAROGONAFU made me realise that this show would be even better if they stopped pretending and made it a straight-up musical.  So, just how much will their Gears change with this new upgrade? I doubt it'll be another overhaul mid-series, kind of betting on a super mode they can activate  which will result in demon biki when she tries to use it.   Why is bikki such a fuckup?  <br> implying it wont be Chris and Tsubasa turning evil  <br><br>Hibiki will save them with little miracle.</br></br></br>  <br>She had a fucked up childhood.</br>  <br>Going by the silhouettes, they will just add more spikes to everything.</br>  <br>What did she fuck up? Besides "being a bitch."</br>  <br>That's last weeks shit post try again.</br>  <br>It's a "oh shit, everyone thinks I'm creepy again" look. It's probably random outbursts like that that caused her to be bullied in the first place.</br>  <br><br>And just what is that expression supposed to convey?</br></br>  <br>Nah, it needs Mamu and maybe even Carol's dad</br>  <br>What if those aren't spikes?</br>  <br>Because her father was an abusive alcoholic?<br>Because people used her as a scapegoat for that incident years ago?</br></br>  <br>Hibiki is completely correct that she has more of a right to Gugnir than Maria did. Recall that Maria spent an entire season essentially working to bring about the end of the world because she and Mamu were dumb enough to believe what Ver fed them.</br>   SOON   <br> abusive <br>You made that up.<br><br>Also<br> muh keywords <br>I'm tired of this meme</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> bitch stole my Gungnir </br>  <br> My...

Show, don't fucking tell.</br></br>  <br>Hibiki<br> muh Gungnir <br>Ando<br> What the heck? <br>Miku<br> Not this shit again, Hibiki </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> anon won't respond to my messages <br> I wish </br></br>  Why is gungnir such a slut?  <br>Nobody said we are okay with it, but it is how it is.<br>Kaneko mostly used to write for JRPG so it makes a lot of sense for him to have a glossary somewhere in whichi to dump all of the details about the world and minor events.<br>Also leaving info-dumping for side-materials give us more screen-time for action scenes.</br></br></br>  <br>Hey family history has been hinted to repeatedly in the show though flasbacks and her behavior.</br>  <br> keywords <br> meme <br>TAKANARE <br>G-BAIT<br>MEETA WO GANTOU<br>G-BAIT<br>FURIKIRE</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So are we going to get any more random cooking songs or was that just a one-time thing?  <br>EUROBEAT INTENSIFIES</br>  <br>One-time thing, I guess.<br>Its going to go downhill from here, the infamous episode 7 is coming.</br></br>  <br>Carol's dad should be on fire.</br>  <br> Hibiki being a little jealous for 2 seconds, WHAT A BITCH </br>  <br>I hope we get more.</br>  <br>In the background on a cross. Yes, i could agree with that</br>  <br>We'll get a training song, which is kind of like cooking but instead of turning ingredients into food you turn girls into men of destiny.</br>    <br>Its like you never watched S1.<br>Bikki was an insensitive cunt back then too.</br></br>  <br> Maria doesn't even have a gear in the first few episodes <br> Still manages to act smart and save people <br> Takes responsibility for her actions and looks to the future <br> Gives Hibiki a harsh, but ultimately needed lecture <br> Steals Gungnir to save everyone even though it doestroys her body <br> Walks off a fucking jam-face to ask the girls if they're ok <br>Alright Maria, you did it. You've earned my respect.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hibiki loses her berserk mode in season 2 <br> Everyone gets berserk modes in season 3 <br>Thank god the logo for this season is coming true.</br></br></br>  <br>Elf  a shit so far but best voice </br>  Zettou Ame no Habakiri &gt; Koi no Okehazama &gt; Beyond the BLADE &gt; Gekkou no Ken<br><br>Prove me wrong.</br></br>  <br>Characters having flaws is a good thing, though.<br>Otherwise go back to SAO/Gundam SEED/Etc</br></br>  <br> &gt;Everyone gets berserk modes in season 3 <br>My everything is not ready for Tsubazerker.</br></br>    <br>You must have gotten that list backwards.</br>  <br> implying we can judge Beyond the BLADE when we could barely hear shit during the episode the song debuted in <br>Anon, I...</br></br>  <br>10/10, I sang</br>  <br>My laughter became music.</br>  <br>Fine work</br>  <br>I miss edgy Tsubasa</br>  <br>We haven't even heard Beyond the BLADE clearly.<br>Zettou Ame no Habakiri &gt; Gekkou no Ken<br>Koi no Okehazama = FLIGHT FEATHERS</br></br></br>  KUCHIBIRU NI<br>NANTE KOTO SURU NO</br>  <br> Show, don't fucking tell. <br>I'd rather have them say "Hey, there's no way to integrate this much detailed information into the visual aspects or dialog of the show, but they're crucial to the plot. Let's not kill screentime and make them available to the fans for free on the site and include that information in a lot of the media and promo material we release."<br><br>Unless you want this to start being handled like an LN haremshit adaptation where characters sit down for 15 minutes per episode to spit out the most banal and hamfisted expository dialog disguised as a conversation that you've ever seen.</br></br></br></br>   Start of episode <br> I'm going to help Hibiki <br> Maria does everything <br> End of episode <br> I'm going to help Hibiki again <br><br>I bet he won't do anything again, fucking useless Ogawa.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well.. it's kind of hinted at that she thinks of herself kind of shittily, and believe the only thing that makes her of any importance to anyone is Gungnir, so...</br>  <br>Calm down your autism. Maybe he was calling the authorities to close off that area to minimize the damage while they were fighting.</br>  <br>Red x Blue, you say?</br>  <br>Anon please we need Listen to my Bait.</br>  <br>Nigga what, who do you think was driving the car Maria was in?</br>  <br>Zettou Ame no Habakiri &gt; Gekkou no Ken<br><br>No questions asked about that, at least.</br></br></br>  <br>No one likes Maria</br>  <br> ... <br> Twice in the same fucking post <br>Your point is sound, but for the love of God don't fucking use ellipses like that.</br></br></br>  <br> driving the car Maria was in <br>Especially hilarious given that Maria is one of the two Symphogears who can drive. The only one, if you don't consider Tsubasa crashing bikes to really be driving.</br></br>  <br>I like that Garie seems to have a short fuse when it comes to Micha.</br>  <br>We have Mariafags here, anon.</br>  <br>They're pretty cute together.

Unless you are talking about Haru Onodera, in which case is such a shame.</br>  <br>Damn what a fucking cutie.<br>What's her name?<br>Too much boat shit at Wonder Festival this year.</br></br></br>  Its a good time to be a boat fag.      <br>Nice.</br>  <br>What show is she from?</br>  <br> that skindentation </br>    QuesQ  Well that was a fat load of fuck all.  <br> quesQ <br> Ro <br>Why</br></br></br>  <br>People say shit like this every Wonfes.

What does FAG stand for when referring to armored girls?<br>Nothing in the guide, plus the acronym 'FAG' makes it difficult to search for.</br>  Where's my Dog Days<br><br>Wonfes<br><br>Where is it</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why no love for U-511?</br></br>  All this boatshit is giving me cancer holy shit, wheres the actual good stuff?

If not I want it, based Artorias.<br><br>After the Bell Gargoyles last year though, I will likely never own it.</br></br></br>  <br>It's awful enough that she's not there with the other three girls, but not being there alone is too cruel.</br>  Any Sidonia besides the Benisuzume figma?  <br>if its at a good price ill take it. Funnyknights dropped the ball with their kongou by making it about 6k too expensive</br>  <br>Artorias the Abysswalker.</br>  <br>it says azone there m8</br>  <br><br>Fuck YOU</br></br>  <br>Don't worry it's a shitty GK.</br>  <br>Nope</br>  <br>I feel you anon, I feel you</br>    Is there any im@s that isn't CG shit?

I just want 765pro. At least ml still has a little 765pro I guess.</br></br>  <br>I think Scamco may be cockblocking that or something; it's definitely not because there is no demand. It feels weird.</br>  <br>I'm still annoyed that GSC is wasting time making these. They don't even make for fun photography.</br>    <br>Fuck, I can't wait.<br>Ram girls are my favorite.</br></br>    <br>Only Yuel and Io have prototypes at the moment.</br>  <br>The figure will be good quality because it's Alter, but the outfit is aesthetic cancer. Any other outfit would be thousands of times better.</br>  It actually happened  <br>Yes, it's Amakuni.</br>  <br>I reall ylike the look of this. Wonder if the manufacturer is someone to give a shit about.</br>  <br>The servers are toasters. It's like this every WonFes.</br>  <br>Best girl, and her school uniform design is cute. Who's making it though?</br>  <br>David a cute</br>  <br> next wonfes <br>The fad will be long gone then. But she is the most popular limited character in the game, maybe she'll hold.</br></br>  <br>Another RAH?</br>  <br>That tiny, tiny p●n●s.</br>  WHERE THE DOG DAYS FIGURES AT?!  <br> freeing <br>why even live</br></br>  <br>Not much recent shows at all, really. Only Kekkai, OPM and surprisingly Rolling Girls if I'm not mistaken.</br>  <br>Mika is the best im@s girl so CG is automatically best.</br>  <br> try to compel all from Twitter <br> fucking minimize new twit randomly <br><br> Go on buyfag thread <br> everything nicely compelled here to enjoy <br><br>Now, anymore stuff guys?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>3Zero m8</br>   No SB69 anything <br><br>Does Sanrio hate figure companies?</br></br>  <br>Eh.<br><br>Not unexpected, but eh.<br><br>Need to see paint before my dick perks up.</br></br></br></br></br>  MAZING FUCKING KAISER RIOBOT!!!!!  <br>Oh yeah, I forgot it would be in January.<br><br><br>Tell Scamco about it; it's definitely not lack of demand, they just don't feel like whoring the girls out that much or something. They could do Saber/Miku-tier releases and sell a lot of the 765 originals but they don't for some reason.</br></br></br></br>  <br>lol they came and went many wonfes ago during the first season fuck tard</br>  Any Purple Heart by Alter sightings?  <br>I don't know if I would get it even for fluff with it being freeing.</br>  <br>They want to enter western market.</br>  <br>Sucks for you</br>  I fucking love this  <br>I need this.</br>  <br> cloth clothes on a scale <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>in the garbage where they belong</br>  <br> Implying all the CG girls aren't shit </br>  Does anyone even give a damn about this shitty movie anymore?  is that it? are all announcements done?      <br>nips do</br>  <br>It'll probably still sell for the headswappability.</br>  <br>Could they have picked a more retarded fabric for the cape?

I cant remember thousands names, Ill see something later to refresh my memory.<br><br>Titpussy a cute  kamo .</br></br></br>  <br>Ushio, Unryuu, Musashi, Nagato</br>  <br>I'm going to tickle Akatsuki's tummy!</br>  <br>Even then they're still reppuu mules and CAs do most of the work. And that's if you used Carrier Task Force, if you use Surface like real men do and aren't some retard that doesn't upgrade is guns you get better results.</br>  Yandere Kongou keeps me alive.  <br>It's a shame for her that Kaga wants her TTK's D.</br>  <br>Yes, the Cure Sunny doujins are all about that. Emetophilia is... interesting.</br>  <br>You what mate? Event time is when they're used as Reppuu mules the most.</br>  Why do people look down on Reppuu muling?<br>It's an important job.</br>  Reminder not to cum on Ryuujou's chest because then the planes would have nowhere to land.  <br>What is that thing she's holding suppose to be</br>  <br>Big gun is cooler, they said</br>  <br>People look down on expeditions girls when they are the most important, we should bully repu sluts.<br><br>HE cum? I need to train myself then.</br></br></br>  <br>You seem to be confusing her with some other girl whose name starts with K.</br>  <br>ok</br>    <br>Because it's god awful.</br>  <br>Why do you keep forcing your disgusting rape fantasy on these poor girls? Haven't they been abused enough already by hideous male admirals as it is? With the amount of people wanting to force their dicks on these poor girls it's no wonder that they're all lesbians.</br>    <br>Hiei being a good lesbian lover for her sister again.</br>  If Houshou-san was my mother things would be different here.      <br> master1200 </br>      <br>If Houshou-san was my wife, we'd be very happy.</br>  <br>Preparing for next summer's CGs.</br>    <br>Shiranui is cute</br>    <br>There are more?</br>      <br>I want to force Haguro to give me Paizuri while the rest of the Myoukous watch.</br>  <br>I would hope for next year.</br>  <br>This should be second to last, not sure why this was out of order though.</br>  <br>Yup, they would be nice to fondle.</br>  <br>Sweden pls go<br><br><br><br> Kancolle <br> small c <br><br><br>He didn't ask about stats</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also this should be third</br>  <br> He didn't ask about stats <br>But he said best everything.</br></br>  <br><br> not using carrier force and putting max planes on one carrier and a max of two reppu on the rest with torpedo bombers and bombers for maximum damage while having AS+ most of the time <br>Why do you even count on BBs in Combined Fleet when they nerf the accuracy of them specifically so hard?<br>That's just retarded.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She is not the best at all</br>  <br> when they nerf the accuracy of them specifically so hard? <br><br> and aren't some retard that doesn't upgrade is guns you get better results. <br><br>Max your fit guns, scrub. I bet you use 46cm on Kongous.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I bet you use 46cm on Kongous. <br>I don't even Kai2 my Kongos.</br></br>  Zuihou!  <br/>  <br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51558938</wbr></br>  Why is Furutaka so lewd?  <br>why</br>  <br>The penalty on Kongous for 46cm is negligible.</br>  <br>Not with combined fleet.</br>  <br>Except it is. My Kongous have 0 problem wiping things out with 46cm and I've only put the guns to 6 stars.<br><br>In fact, Hotels and Nagatos do worse in my combined fleets.</br></br></br>  <br>That meat is soft, but I am diamonds.</br>  <br>I love how with that bit of extra pudge, the artist changed her navel to a bit of a horizontal one. Shit is golden.</br>  Anyone got link for Kaga enka song? The old one is deleted  <br>Kamo Kamo!</br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/IogNCQFvMuQ  [ ]<br><br>Funny thing, this played while pushing the fleet through a warm up round on 1-4. enjoy</br></br></br>  <br> Prerelease <br><br>When's the full version?</br></br></br>  <br>Next month.</br>  <br>Thanks a lot LB</br>   my Haruna just two nodes away from Kai Ni, at red health but don't want to waste rsc repairing <br> she gets sunk on the last battle <br><br>I pray in my heart of hearts that she will one day forgive me</br></br></br>  <br>Ahahahahaha faggot.</br>  <br> but don't want to waste rsc repairing <br><br>What's wrong with you?</br></br></br>  <br>Kuso</br>  <br>Nigga, you just went full kuso.</br>  <br>Damecon you fool.</br>  <br>Maximus KUSO.</br>  <br> don't want to waste rsc repairing <br>Nigga its an even bigger waste training up another ship to Lvl 78</br></br>  <br> I pray in my heart of hearts that she will one day forgive me <br>She won't she's gone forever, you piece of shit.</br></br>  <br>Just find another one.</br>    <br>Good luck spending more hours and 30k+ resources for a level 80 Haruna, right before event time.</br>  <br>Haruna is common drop</br>  <br>yeah, but that's not the one you sunk is it?</br>      <br>What a kuso</br>  <br>So? She looks the same.</br>  <br>Proofs?</br>  <br>Now this is diejoubu.</br>    <br>You are quite possibly even more kuso then Pengo! Not daijoubu! And you deserve no forgiveness from her.</br>  <br>Damn, you're so damn Kuso.<br>Kuso among Kusos.</br></br>  <br>Just do min LSC, another one will pop right out.</br>  <br>This song gets stuck in my head</br>  <br>Chill m8, I kill my DDs everytime I sortie to 1-6. Just get another and don't fuck up again.</br>  Korosho  <br>Or 3-2A farm, I have gotten quite a few Kongou class from there.</br>  <br>Eagerly awaiting the full version. 2m10s is far too short.<br><br><br>But A-E-G-F-B is so easy, how do you manage that?</br></br></br></br>  <br> shame </br>  <br>Its either this, or the Wanker song.<br>I think I think this song would be better.</br></br>  <br>He's most likely a kuso who uses sacrificial DDs for 1-6.</br>  <br>Haha no, I like Kaga's Cape but WANKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRR was the best part of Winter event.</br>  <br>So long as your flagship isn't red you can reach the end of 1-6 and get the reward so using level 1s and letting them sink is a very cheap method of doing it.</br>  Well what's the moral difference between scrapping/modernizing lvl.1 ships or using them as fodder in maps?<br><br>It's the same thing, they both end up dead.</br></br>  <br>The difference is your mother wishes she aborted you.</br>  <br>Scrapping/modernizing takes their equipments off and they return to being regular girls.<br><br>Sinking kills them.</br></br></br>  <br>No they don't, their equipment is scrapped or used for improvement and the girls just lead normal lives. They probably take front-desk jobs at naval bases and things like that.</br>  <br>Yes, next month is only a few days but it feels like months.<br><br>Wanker is great too but I prefer this more because of Kaga</br></br></br>  <br>You have a whole month after 1-5 to do it, it's not like you're in such dire straits that you can't do it over time. Are the ranking points and a present box so vital?</br>  <br/>  <br>Are level 1s and a few losses worth more? You save resources and they are ships you aren't going to use anyway.</br>  <br>you keep messing up</br>  <br> Kaga gets the best song <br>I hate to say it but I'm envious of you Kagafags.</br></br>  <br>This time I got it right.</br>  <br>The amount of resources spent on completing 1-6 7 times are negligible. The life of a shipgirl is not. Though losses aren't important since you can grind out your ratio.</br>  Finally I have found it, my very own sun<br>my   /ai/ idle activities  </br>  <br>Akari became a white dwarf.</br>  The guide: http://pastebin.com/iDebHQu6  Catching up with Aikatsu.<br> I'm glad Kokone is gone. </br>  I want to fuck Lala.  <br>I got excited for a Genei thread, but it's just you idol guys.<br><br>Have fun I guess.</br></br></br>  <br>Same, RIP.</br>  <br>I always look forward to your lewd picture of Lala.</br>  <br>Me too dude.<br><br><br>Me too dude.</br></br></br></br>  ded  <br>Me too dude.</br>  <br>Damn, that was fast.</br>  <br>Just finished it.

Fuck idol shows, generals, and especially idol show generals.</br>  <br> I was without internet for an entire week last month. Having to browse /ai/ and /pc/ only from my phone was terrible. </br>  <br>We will gladly discuss it with you if you bring up something to talk about.</br>   <br>truly the struggle</br>  I think Clearite is making a Sumire x Sena doujin. Just based on what has been posted over the last few weeks.  <br> Sumire x Sena <br>Unacceptable, only Akari X Sena is proper</br></br>  <br>Sena is for everybody.</br>  <br>Akari is now a  cuck .</br>  <br> not Akari <br>Damn it. Oh well, Sena does look cute.</br></br>    <br>I hope it's NTR and has a yandere Sumire.</br>  <br>Then Madoka should be involved.</br>  pomf  <br>You can find the shitty raws for 39 over at https://mega.co.nz/#F!yR8yDYYI!M8tW<wbr>5gH_OVZBbDm-CQffMg</wbr></br>    Well /ai/?  <br>She already has the perfect name for prostitution.</br>  Can we discuss how Akari is hot?  Go touhou and untranslated novel board.  <br>Ehh? I always thought it was Fushigi Mahou Fan Fan Pharmacy</br>  <br>Doublefun Drugstore, actually.</br>  What a cheap solution.  Was she alive this episode? Or has she been deported?  <br>She's super hot.</br>  This is some doujin level shit.  <br><br>I want to fuck Non while you're fucking Lala.</br></br>  Weird ass moon.    <br>I want to fuck Moon.</br>  <br>I want to be that dolphin.</br>  What do young girls want?  <br>Ugly dresses and easy games.</br>  <br>Dresses with<br>hear this<br> WINGS </br></br></br>  <br>They're out of fashion these days.</br>  The girl in the middle is wearing some really short shorts for a children's show.  <br>They're all so lewd. Also Wakana is on the left there.</br>  <br>I want cat back.</br>  <br>heart eyes are kind of lewd, but that twintails looks like she's absolutely begging for it.</br>  <br>Is that an apron obscured midriff?</br>  <br>I want Juri in my kitchen cooking delicious Spanish dishes for me.</br>  <br>Yeah. There was a few shots of her in the episode without the apron.</br>  <br>I want to lick it</br>  <br>What is more disturbing is the detail on the waist. Is that what they call "vagina bones"?</br>  <br>Dude in back checking out those midriffs.</br>  <br>Me too dude, tsumari get in line.</br>      <br>Happy crying Yurika is really bad for my heart.</br>  <br>This made my night, thanks.</br>  Do we have a stream this week?  <br>usual place</br>  The anime in the OP pic is not a show for little girls. It's misleading.  <br>Almost all the watchers of it are from /ai/ anyway.</br>  Just caught up with Pripara, what about the movie?  MAGICAL CHANGE<br>MAGICAL SMILE<br>MAGICAL MAGICAL</br></br>  <br>I love that image of Akari. It's amazing.</br>  <br>I could still do without this OP every week</br>  <br>Wasn't just a bunch of clip shows?</br>  <br>I want Akari to look on me with disdain.</br>  <br>Fuck, really?</br>  <br>Too bad! Akari is a nice girl who loves all of her fans.</br>  Larima the cutest!<br><br><br>Or maybe it was that the Christmas special.</br></br></br>  Top Jew.  Now this is Aikatsu!  Larima a cute. A CUTE!  <br>But how would she react on learning that one masturbates to her?</br>  Boxing idols. I'm a fan  Fit as fuck.   /fit/ as fuark Larimar <br><br>Yes, I can fap to this.</br></br>  Dem gainz.  <br>My brother.</br>  Do not want muscle-Larimar.  So they can stay as human as long they don't use magic.  <br><br>They need to POWAH UP the henshin so it can last past one magic spell use.</br></br>  <br>She'd probably cry and give up her Aikatsu. Could you live with yourself?</br>  Astrology yay.<br><br><br>Yeah, I hope this is the beginning of this kind of episodes.</br></br></br>  Larimar's sex-face  <br>I wanna lick all over Larima's face.</br>  Damn.   no human Larima performance   Labra?

I seriously don't trust this prince guy.  <br>We don't even allow Precure in this thread, so it's very strange to have Gen'ei as the OP.</br>  <br> guy </br>  <br><br> implying TT will do reverse trap now </br></br>    When was the last time PP changed OPs?<br><br><br>It's a special case, like Fantasista Doll.</br></br></br>  Stream? I started watching raw because I'm sick of waiting for Doki, pls help  <br><br> We don't even allow Precure in this thread <br><br>Jewish propaganda.

Celebrity 4   Fuwari's joining a quartet of hags.  <br>The four baka quartet it seems.</br>  Why are Mirei and Sophie nowhere in the preview? It seems like Lala is the only one doing anything to get Fuwari to join SoLaMi Smile.  remove prince  Celebrity!  <br>remove pripara</br>  <br>bring back kyupikon</br>  Did they really make a team of christmas cakes?<br>ARE THEY FINALLY LISTENING TO ME?</br>  <br>More like old hags than christmas cakes.</br>  I wish PP would do the same stuff Arc-V did and bring characters from other seasons back as alternate universe forms, with that in mind, Which characters would you bring back? Hard mode: No Rinne.  <br>Was this any good?</br>  <br>The Saints and June</br>  <br> tfw they'll just end up as Gloria style comedic relief </br>    <br>Rhythm and her great fashion sense.

What makes her special? She would still be curbstomped by Cargikk before reaching the majin.</br>  Why is Shinji considered a "pussy whining faggot who can't do anything" when Asuka is far more annoying than him? I went into this show expecting him to be insufferable but the character bitching and moaning all the time is the red-head. Fuck she isn't even all that good a pilot for all the shitalking she does. Does she get likable after character development or remain this one note bitch?  I find a lot of the characters to lack a sufficient amount of human qualities for me to find them relatable. Shinji, Asuka, Misato, Gendo, Ritsuko, and Rei are all so exaggerated or poorly-rounded that I don't give a shit about them or their problems.  All Eva characters  besides one  have been deliberately designed to be unappealing with very obvious irredeemable flaws.<br>You're retarded if you consider any of them your waifu.</br>  Because Asuka is a girl so she's acting as she's supposed to while Shinji is a guy so he must be tough and put that tsundere bitch back to her place  <br> I find a lot of the characters to lack a sufficient amount of human qualities <br>Full retard.</br></br>  <br>Why does it always have to be either being obsessed with the characters or hating them?<br><br>Most Eva's characters are actually very nice. Yes, even Asuka. They all have good and bad moments.<br>It's only that, as the series progresses towards the end, the bad ones become more apparent, but this is also very much because of the situation they're in.<br><br>The fights become harder and have a more psychological impact, especially on the pilots. Towards the end, everyone is on edge and too busy with himself and his own problems, which is why (I think) so many finish the show thinking they are all horrible people.<br><br>But really, if you think Shinji or Asuka is either 100% bitch or 100% nice, then you didn't pay any attention to the show. They have their bad moments and some good ones, just like real people.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop making sense, you're derailing a potential asuka rei kaworu waifu war thread.</br>  <br> lack a sufficient amount <br> this means 100% </br></br>  <br>This. I am very baffled by people who can find them likable or sympathetic.</br>  <br> lack a sufficient amount <br> for me to find them relatable <br> Shinji, Asuka, Misato, Gendo, Ritsuko, and Rei are all so exaggerated or poorly-rounded that I don't give a shit about them or their problems. <br><br>He said they were exaggerated. How?<br>Just because their each characters' actions originate from mostly one character trait (Shinji = Avoidant; Asuka = Narcisstic; etc.) doesn't mean they're too exaggerated to be relatable.<br><br>Since this thread is aimed at Asuka I will point out some nice things she did:<br>-Finding a place to eat that takes Rei's veganism and Misato's low budget into consideration.<br>-Admiring Shinji's ability to play the cello<br>-Her concern for Shinji in the hospital (which she tried to hide)<br><br>These are some very minor and mostly superficial elements, but they still show that Asuka tries to be nice once in a while.<br><br> But he said "for me"! It's all relative and it's just his opinion! <br>Yes, and this is mine. While watching the show I found enough reason to see why people like Asuka. You don't have to share the same problems as a character to find them relatable and given Asuka's history, I found her character very realstic and relatable and I saw "a sufficient amount of human qualities".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yes, and this is mine. <br>Cool. Then we both have our impressions of the show that work for us.</br></br>  <br>The thing is, if all it takes to avoid having others criticize your opinion is to write<br> well, duh that's just my opinion, you can have yours. <br>Then there is no point in ever posting here, because you don't engage in any discussion, but only post your own opinion and tell people who disagree to fuck off.<br><br>My opinion doesn't have to be right, but if others disagree I try to point out why I have this certain opinion that I do and, thus we engage in discussion.<br>I try to give reason why I have mine and you should give reason why you have yours. Maybe you can convince someone of yours or he can convince you of his, but even if we don't the very least we try to understand the reasons why the other person has his specific opinion.<br><br>Not every discussion has to end in war.<br>But this doesn't mean we shouldn't try to justify the opinions we have. That's why we post here and not on some shitty blog.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The thing is, if all it takes to avoid having others criticize your opinion is to write <br>I'm not avoiding having anyone respond to my post, I just don't have any interest in engaging in a conversation I have had a few times before and has been fruitless each time. I was giving the OP my opinion. You're welcome to give yours and he can judge the merits of each.</br></br>  <br>Nice or not, the baffling part is the fact that Shinji gets all the flack for his flaws while Asuka who is far worse doesn't. At least Shinji does his job well and actively tries to be decent and helpful even though his life sucks.</br>  <br>I guess that makes somewhat sense, but it is still lazy. Reasonably lazy, but lazy nonetheless.<br><br><br>But that's mostly the fans isn't it? I'd say by this point it is basically a fact that girls get less harsh treatment, just because they're girls, which of course isn't how it should be, but unfortunatelly how it is.<br>And yes, Shinji is far more bearable than Asuka.<br><br>If I was a character in the NGE universe, I'd porbably dislike Asuka as a person and be friends with Shinji, but I still think she is a well written character and even someone you can like if you know her circumstances (which you won't, unless you are a spectator who watches the show).<br><br>But since I am not a person within that universe and because I am just a spectator, I can see that Asuka isn't just a bitch. She is bitchy, but also far more than that.<br><br>Don't worry, I don't like the fact that people always shit on Shinji, either, but this doesn't mean I have to like people shitting on Asuka. If people shat on Rei (without justification), I'd probably try to defend her, too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Eventually she starts struggling with the fact that she can't be the perfect, sexy EVA pilot that she wants to be and pretty much shuts down because of the realization. She gets fucked up, anon, don't worry.  <br>I liked her because I thought she was funny. I honestly couldn't take anything that came out of her mouth seriously. She was full of shit and I found that entertaining.</br>  <br>Rei gets shat on more than Shinji though.<br><br>There's been like three-four threads this week where she gets shat on, mostly by Kaworu fans and Asuka fans.<br><br>Where were you?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reifags shit on other characters the most.</br>  <br>Not that anon but Rei Ayanami was the most popular character since NGE started, Anno even got angry with the audience because he intended to make a creepy child, not a sex doll. Lately her popularity has decreased among the fanbase but she's still the sex fantasy of thousand of geeks around the world.<br><br>Shinji doesn't sell</br></br></br>  <br>Obviously not there. Anon, I can only do so much.</br>  <br>See <br><br><br>You're here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because she has fire. He is a wet fart.</br>  <br>But none of them insult Rei.</br>  <br>They do.</br>  <br>It's obviously an attack on Rei if it belittles the character as a mere sex fantasy and claim that it's only point is to be a creepy child.<br><br>IMO you just lost my sympathy.</br></br></br>  <br>Welcome to /a/. People will shit on you're waifu relentlessly here. They do it to everyone. If you don't like that, fuck off.</br>  <br>Not talking to you cockknob.</br>  <br>Reifags to it to other characters all the time.</br>  <br> lying </br>  <br>Who do you think is always starting the bitchfights with Asukfags on how they only like their waifu for fanservice? <br>Give me a fucking break. You do it because of insecurity and jealously, Reifag.<br>You do the same to Kaworufags too.</br></br></br>  <br>Now that I've grown up, when I rewatched it, I found that their personalities make a lot more sense than I originally gave them credit for, especially Shinji.<br>I had the unrealistic expectation that as the 'MC' he should rise to any and all occasions. But the reality is that very few people if put in a position that dire would ever stand up to it, especially at the Shinji's age.<br>Same for Asuka and Rei.<br>Though their backgrounds are all very different, they're just kids.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop shitting on others first then things will improve.</br>  <br>Nah. I've been around /a/ since 2004 and since then as now it's always been Asuka fans that are the most belligerent, both passive-aggressively and directly. <br><br>Rei fans usually attack in defense.</br></br></br>  <br>So you admit, Reifags shit on others too.</br>  <br><br>You're the ones that shit on other characters first.</br></br>  <br>It doesn't matter if you're not talking to me or not, my point still stands. People will have different opinions here, yes, some will even hate you're waifu. Don't cry like a baby just because this isn't your persona Reifag tumblr hugbox.</br>  <br><br>see <br><br> Who do you think is always starting the bitchfights with Asukfags on how they only like their waifu for fanservice?  <br><br>That line in particular has been the operating attack from Asuka fans towards Rei fans (and Kaworu fans) since the early 2000's on english-speaking websites.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Playing the innocent victim </br>  <br>Asukafags mostly. Kaworufans too. If we also look at evangelion, they're the characters with the objectively most fanservice, so you don't really have to be a rei fan to call them out.</br>  <br> the objectively most fanservice <br>That would be Misato. <br>And doesn't Rei show up naked the most out of the entire show?</br></br></br>  <br>That's what you just did. Everyone who has been on /a/ for more than a few days know you're the worst, just in the last weeks there's dozens of threads concerning why Rei a shit.<br><br>For those who has been here longer, they'd also know that the above is nothing new.</br></br></br>  <br> why Rei a shit <br>Asuka gets threads like that too. Kaworu gets threads like that sometimes as well. Shinji gets threads like that almost every single fucking day, and yet you don't see Shinjifags bitching.</br></br>  <br>Simple:<br>Because of what's between her legs.<br><br>Asuka's still a qt, though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Your point is irrelevant to what I and the other poster was saying. Why not go outside and shout it as well?<br><br><br> That would be Misato.  <br>I don't think so. She's got fanservice but Asuka one-ups her easily. Rei also has fanservice but Asuka has more still.<br><br>When we account for the spinoffs there's definitely more Asuka fanservice there, the biggest and newest thing (Rebuild) has more fanservice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Asuka gets threads like that too.  <br>Not nearly as many.<br><br> Kaworu gets threads like that sometimes as well.  <br>Not nearly as many.<br><br> Shinji gets threads like that almost every single fucking day <br>Nonsense. Also<br><br>  and yet you don't see Shinjifags bitching. <br>then what is this thread about?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nonsense. <br>It's not nonsense, Shinji objectively gets shit on the most out of every Eva character, ten fold in fact.<br>You've got threads and posts on /a/ shitting on him constantly daily. And yet you don't have Shinjifags sperging like manchildren as you yourself are so fond of doing. Grow up.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, none of em gets as much as Rei except maybe Shinji, and then it's not the same type of hate-thread. Asuakfags are generally poisonous people who make the thread to attack and crap on a character because of waifu rivalry.<br><br>When Shinji gets some thread about why he's a pussy, it's always some newbie to Evangelion who was expecting something else, rather than some sort of waifu war tactic.<br><br>The latter is tolerable, the former one is actually seeking to start a waifu war.<br><br> and yet you don't see Shinjifags bitching. <br>There's always one in every thread like the one mentioned above, and did you not read the OP? It's more or less whining about how Asukafags can give Shinji shit but avoid to give Asuka shit for being the same or worse.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Again, that's nonsense. There's hardly any Shinji-threads, if anything there's just as many pro-shinji threads, this one for example.<br>Also, whenever there's a thread about how Shinji is a wuss, it's always some newfag who's watching it and expects Goku or Luffy, it's got nothing to do with actual shitting on a character like Asukafags or otherfags do.</br></br>  <br> Again, that's nonsense <br>It isn't. One pro-Shinji thread in every blue moon does not excuse him being one of the most hated Anime characters in the entire western Anime fanbase. He's relentlessly shit on everywhere, by newfags or not is irrelevant. <br>The point is he's shit on more than you're waifu, and yet Shinjifags do not childishly sperg and whine to even 1/100th of the extent Reifags do.<br>He's the punching bag of the fanbase, don't even try to deny and pretend that you Reifags deserve any sympathy and praise for your shitty victim-complex.</br></br></br></br>  I like every single nge character and I think especially Shinji, Asuka and Rei have amazing writing.  <br>Thank you for having good taste. But why the hell are you on /a/?</br>  <br>Why is Shinji considered a faggot when OP sucks far more cocks than him? I went into this thread expecting him to get ragged on, but the one bitching and moaning all the time is OP. Fuck he isn't even that good at the shittalking he does. Does OP ever stop sucking dicks after he stops being underaged or remain this laughable caricature of an angst ridden ubderfaggot?</br>  <br>I mostly just feel like arguing when he's called all pussy and the stupid white knight heroics and aggressive streak are neglected.</br>  <br>The rebuilds are shit though, as are all characters in it.</br>  <br>Rebuild are a squeakel</br>  <br><br><br> I find a lot of the characters to lack a sufficient amount of human qualities for me to find them relatable. <br><br>That's the point you idiot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him, it is? I think they are very human, that's why I like them.</br>  <br>They are probably the most humane characters that has been created.</br>  <br> Reifags hating on Shinji <br><br>Suddenly it all makes sense</br></br></br>  <br>That's mostly samefags though. Shitting on Shinji goes waaaay back to probably the beginning of this fanbase for some reason. No one ever got as much shit as he did.</br>  <br>Reifags only like him when he comes to save their waifu.</br>  <br> and yet you don't see Shinjifags bitching. <br>Oh please Shinjifags hijacked Asuka threads and kawoshitters get butthurt and start shitposting the minute you inform them their waifu is shit. These groups are basically the same circlejerk of people.</br></br>  <br>I've never seen a Shinjifag bitch; I have seen plenty of KawoShinfags do so though.</br>  <br>This one <br>Bitched a whole lot in an Asuka thread a while ago and image dumped it to death before shitposting and crying.</br></br>  <br>What you posted is a Kaworufag, not a Shinjifag. Are you mentally retarded?</br>  <br>Same shit in these threads, fujo. Once you get a "shinjifag" mad enough it won't take long for them to start calling everyone a waifufag and dumping Kaworu/kawoshin.</br>  <br>This thread is a shinjifag bitching.<br><br><br> by newfags or not is irrelevant.  <br>It is relevant because it means it's just an initial reaction as opposed to being shat on, i.e there's not any group of people that exists to shit on shinji.<br><br> but your victim complex <br>that's the entirety of your post. good going denying the tons of pro-shinji threads and the fact that many people, reifags mostly and most misatofags after 3.0 are the ones doing the defending.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't even think there's such a thing as a "Shinjifag" who isn't also a Kaworu/KawoShinfag</br>  <br> shinjifag <br> kawoshinfag <br>Same shit <br>Both are fujo minorities who shitpost to make up for their lack of numbers</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shinjifags want Shinji to be happy, so naturally they'll ship him with Kaworu. <br>They aren't Kaworufags though just because they ship the canon pairing, we couldn't give less of a shit about Kaworu as a character.<br>We aren't going to come to his defense and the landwhales who sperg over him anytime soon.</br></br></br>  <br>This THREAD is about a shinjifag bitching because Asuka is more well received  honestly Shinji is pretty bland anyway so his flaws will stand out more, while Asuka is flamboyant and energetic </br>  <br>And how is that any different from the cancerous Asuka and Reifags?<br>It's not except we don't make constant "hurr hurr post Usacar for teh moot xD" threads and shit up the board with our shitflinging waifufag arguments every thread.<br>Shinjifags &gt; Asuka/Reifags</br></br></br>  <br>There are  LASfags  who don't self-insert as Shinji, but we're small in numbers.</br>  <br><br>Reifags always liked Shinji. They have a tendency to like people/characters who get kicked around a lot, which Shinji and Rei both represent.<br><br>In these days and the days before, Asukafags did the "Shinji a shit" dance for the most part to be backed up by the anime community. In recent times even Kaworufags have become extremely dismissive of Shinji since the new canon of Evangelion requires it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Being a LASfag and not self-inserting <br>Look, I don't even ship, but being a LASfag without self inserting is nonsensical. That being said, that's just Evagekks shit right there.</br></br>  <br>For one thing, neither of those group shitpost and shit stir to the degree you do. You feel insecure here in territory that is not as welcoming as it is for Asuka/Rei, so you lash out more. </br>  <br>Pretty sure that kind of LASfag is bisexual and just ships their waifu and husbando</br>  <br>In terms of defending or liking Shinji, here's the list:<br><br>Shinjifags &gt; Reifags &gt; Misatofags &gt; Kaworufags &gt; Asukafags<br><br><br>No, you're a Kawoshinfag. If you wanted Shinji to be happy, you'd actually cross out Kaworu. You're not allowing you're waifu a normal life, and by rejecting the happiness he achieves before Kaworu, you're proving that you aren't Shinjifags.<br><br>At most you're moefags that prey on Shinji's weaknesses. Shinji could become like Rei Q and it'd still be OK for you guys.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hurr let me make up different definitions for shit on to validate my delusion that us Reifags are the punching bags of the fanbase <br> a bloo bloo no one suffers as much as us! <br>Grow the fuck up.<br><br><br>You support Shinji being abused. You don't like him, you just selfinsert for femdom shit. Fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't say anything about who was the punching bag or not, just that you're the one with a victim complex.<br><br>Look at this thread. You are projecting hard man. How about you grow the fuck up?</br></br></br>  <br> You support Shinji being abused. You don't like him, you just selfinsert for femdom shit. Fuck off. <br><br>Teased yes, abused no. :^)</br></br></br>  <br>Nah you're just a fujoshit. Shinji is happy before and after Kaworu but you pretend it doesn't exist. I'm sure you get butthurt when people shit on the faggot or your ship, too.</br>  <br> Reifags always liked Shinji <br>Yeah, I'm sure.<br>Drawing pictures of her kicking Shinji's face in really proves your point: </br></br></br>  <br> You support Shinji being abused. You don't like him, you just selfinsert for femdom shit.  <br> Fuck off. <br><br>Not that guy, but if you support Kawoshin you're no better. Kawoshin is inherently abusive in canon and otherwise. It stands for abusing Shinji's weaknesses at his worst, and giving him a false happiness.</br></br></br></br>  <br> all this projection <br> all this asspain <br>You aren't making a good case for yourself.</br></br></br>  <br> neither of those group shitpost and shit stir to the degree you do </br>  <br>You're assuming the artist is a Reifag, and even then there's plenty of Kaworu fans who draw Shinji getting pounded like a bitch by Kaworu or have him stabbed by him with a lance and so on.</br>  <br>my brother of african american descent</br>  <br>does Shinji really start cross-dressing in the manga?</br>  <br> Shinji getting pounded like a bitch by Kaworu <br>Manga Kawoshin. It's in-character. I'm personally not a fan, but whatever floats Sadamoto's gay ass boat.<br><br> have him stabbed by him with a lance and so on <br>Oh fuck off with this cherry-picking shit, 90% of Kawoshin art is them smiling and doing fluffy cute shit and you know it.<br>Reifags draw her shitting in Shinji's mouth in doujinshi, for fuck's sake. <br>You don't care, stop pretending you care.<br>You only care when he's doing it for your waifu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just the doujins</br>  Kawoshinfags, and "Shinjifags", how can you support Kaworu x Shinji if it's implicitly bad for Shinji?  <br>Do you need someone to start posting Kawoshin gore or rape to realize how retarded this logic is?</br>  <br> how can you support Asuka x Shinji if it's implicitly bad for Shinji? <br> how can you support Rei x Shinji if it's implicitly bad for Shinji? <br> how can you support Misato x Shinji if it's implicitly bad for Shinji? <br>It's the best of the bunch by far. Anno and co. agreed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>None of those are as bad for Shinji as shipping him with Kaworu.<br><br>Those three are relatively normal to Kaworu, and Kaworu's "love" always means betraying or hurting Shinji in the most pointless of ways. There's literally no other coupling in Evangelion you can choose that's worse. Imagine how hateful and hurting Kaworu is if he tries?</br></br></br>  <br>You've been shitposting ever since 3.33 generals. You must have stuck your head far up your own ass if you think people can't see through you.</br>  <br> Manga Kawoshin. It's in-character. I'm personally not a fan, but whatever floats Sadamoto's gay ass boat. <br>uh, it's not in character. It never happened.<br><br>Also, Asuka slaps and kicks Shinji, Toji punches Shinji, Rei slaps Shinji, does that mean they're "off the hook" too because it's in character?<br>Way to sink your own argument, as if anyone reasonable couldn't see it was dead in the water to begin with.<br>(lol hey I just pick a random image off the net and even if the artist isn't a reifag it means it represents all reifags!)<br><br> Oh fuck off with this cherry-picking shit <br>You just cherrypicked as well. One picture among thousands.<br><br>You're giant hypocrite, you know that? This whole picture thing was an argument you started and promptly failed. How about you stop pretending you care about Shinji and isn't just here to be a fetishist?<br><br>I think what you just said here: <br> You only care when he's doing it for your waifu. <br><br>is describing EXACTLY what you're doing.<br><br>Shinji has 25 episodes worth of material in the anime, in many of which he's perfectly happy and stable as a person. Smiling, walking with friends, but apparently none of that counts if he isn't shipped with another male.<br><br>You're perverted, and that's your entire reason for being her. Admit it. Just do it. Otherwise you'd have no qualms accepting that Shinji was happier without Kaworu than with.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Compare this official art of Kawoshin to this official art of AsukaxShinji:<br><br><br>Notice how he doesn't look happy? Yeah, me too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>None of those characters drove Shinji to suicide or made him kill them.</br>  <br> promotional art decides who he's happy with <br><br>funny how kaworufags are fans of such a shallow character they literally have to rely on promotionals</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, the actual canon does that. Ironically, your fanfiction doesn't, waifufag.</br>   2015 <br> people are STILL buttmad that Kawoshin is canon and as gay as ever <br>Anno you dirty bitch, it's like you intentionally want to drink the tears of otaku suffering.</br></br>  <br>That's not even Kaworu though, it's just Lilith wearing his face</br>  <br>How does this answer the question? There is official art of Shinji happy with Asuka, too. In the show itself Shinji makes friends and has many happy moments WITHOUT Kaworu. <br><br>Besides your logic of someone drawing a pic where Shinji gets hurt meaning EVERY one of the character's fans hate him is retarded.</br></br></br>  <br> w-why did Shinji think Rei was creepy and was scared of her in episode 24? <br> m-muh waifu Rei isn't creepy, she's a perfect angel! <br> WHY DID SHINJI CHOOSE A GUY OVER MUH WAIFU, EVEN THOUGH SHE'S SO PERFECT AND WONDERFUL <br> BOO HOO, ANNO YOU FUCKER! WHY WON'T YOU PANDER TO ME! <br>When will the Reifags kill themselves.<br>When.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> giant Rei <br> AAAAAAAAAAAAUGH!!! <br> giant Kaworu <br> oh hey Kaworu that's cool as long as its you <br>what a fag.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you by chance retarded? It's Kaworu. <br>Rei takes in his embryo before she merges with Lilith. Hence why she's in the back, and Kaworu's in the front. The forbidden union between Adam and Lilith, and it's Adam/Kaworu that is the one who appears to Shinji when he gets tanged as his most loved person.</br></br>  <br>And here we see the "shinjifag" resort to shitposting once it's arguments fall apart.</br>  <br>Wow, way to prove you're a delusional shithead.<br><br><br>It's really fucking sad.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And Reifags still claim Shinji would be happy with her. <br>Give me a fucking break, he can't even look at her without freaking out.</br></br>  <br> I can't admit I'm wrong and my argument was retarded, let me call him butthurt and a reifag, that'll show em! <br>K E K</br></br>  <br><br> Giant Naked Kaworu mindbreaks Shinji <br> that's how you know they're a perfect couple! </br></br></br>  <br> b-but muh AT Field overload! </br>  <br><br> yfw Shinji will never smile like this with you're waifu <br>It hurts, doesn't it.</br></br></br>  <br>It's super romantic, anon.<br> kawoshinfags give Asuka x Shinji shippers shit when they are this fucked up </br></br>  <br>Ironically, it was by seeing Ayanami's jacked up face that made Shinji mindbroken, as the bridge trio was so clear to point out.<br><br><br>Nothing more fucked up than shipping a crackpairing, m8.</br></br></br></br>    <br> yfw you will keep evading the topic and pretend your didn't make a fool of yourself <br>Also, you're proving your argument wrong AGAIN <br>You are terminally retarded</br></br></br>  <br> implying </br>  <br>This a million times.</br>  <br> Gendofags <br> existing outside of Gendo </br></br>  <br>Truly the best boy.</br>  <br> kawoshitters never watched the show <br><br>And not one person was surprised. Someone should make a collage of all the smiles Shinji gave everyone to blow this landwhale's mind.</br></br></br>  Gendothread?<br>Sign my ass up.</br>  <br>I think it's pretty clear Shinji loves Kaworu. However, I don't think Shinji is gay. I think he just craves real affection and Kaworu is the only person who gave it to him since before his mother died. That's why I like pic related. She's cool, and in my book, she's a great addition to the cast.</br>  <br>He's smiling at Kaji there. Confirmed for not watching the show.</br>  <br> Kaworufags confirmed for liking Mari Sue <br><br><br>And what are your thoughts on  ?</br></br></br></br>  <br>No one is arguing Shinji is gay. <br>That's retarded. He's canonically bisexual, at least in the Anime.<br>In the Manga he's full on gay.</br></br></br>  <br> all the smiles Shinji gave everyone <br>Confirmed for being incapable of reading.

I'm sure reverse image searching will bring up the Eva artist who worked on that one.</br>  <br>ok, fine. but is that any excuse for the creators of the FUCKING MATRIX to go and shit out a turd like this?

There's no escaping because there's an extensive record of the two shitting up threads and whenever they get caught they blame some invisible puppeteer Reifag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ignoring the existence of the autistic conspiracy-theorist Reifag <br>Wow.</br></br>  <br> whenever they get caught they blame some invisible puppeteer Reifag. <br>The hypocrisy involved when you claim <br> two autistic asukafags <br>is fucking gold. Not to mention most Kaworufags are problem posters. Lurk more, kid.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Think you forgot an insufferable reifag or 2.</br>  <br><br> proving my point <br>This is why threads are shit. You two.</br></br></br>  <br> forgetting  which you'll just handwave as a samefag <br> literally ousting yourself as the batshit paranoid Reifag <br>Great job. You don't see such inefficacy in arguing every day, folks.</br></br></br>  <br>And for the record, whether you think I'm some concocted image of an Asukafag or not, really the only posts of mine in this thread were discussing Speed Racer.<br><br>Looks like you fucked up, unsurprisingkly, again.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, because dedgrandpa Reiheart is clearly neither autistic nor insufferable.</br>  <br><br>No one forgotten. The problem posters are _always_ the one Kaworufag (because we have evidence of the Kaworufag admitting to it) and two Asukafags (because they've both been caught red-handed more than once).<br><br>The Reifags/Shinijfags/whateverthefucko<wbr>therfags aren't problem-posters because like it or not, they discuss /a/nime and Evangelion, which triggers the the mentioned shitposters and here we go. This thread was just the proof. Look at all the autistic asukafags/kaworufags ITT, it's all the shit of any thread you claim is a problem and there's only you to blame for it. Bravo.<br><br>Because you spend all day every day shitting up evangelion threads on /a/, spreading faked propaganda like <br>but never actually talking anime and evangelion. This waifu wars shit is all you live for.<br><br><br>see above. You are the problem.</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>let's just be thankful that we still have a place to argue every day. you never know when the Faggening will happen and the bastards pull the plug for good.</br>  <br>I thought Greg Ayres was a lot better than the other three fags who voiced him. <br>Then again, the Eva dub is the only dub I've ever fully atched and it was during my childhood. I may be running mostly on nostalgia.</br></br>  <br> this textwall of supreme butthurt by the Reifag autist </br>  <br>Again, proving me right and everyone except your small circle of circlejerking waifuwar-faggots.<br><br>Boogeyman after boogeyman.</br></br></br>  <br>Hasn't made anything good since EoE.

Worse than than any other evafag I've seen.<br><br>I think you are the reifag or you haven't been paying attention the last few weeks.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> masquerading as an Asukafag while you're actually the Reifag and bashing yourself because you realized you fucked up </br>  <br><br> Reifag once again resorting to meta <br>Hilarious. It's like that's the only thing you're mind can comprehend. <br>Go join your buddy in death: </br></br></br></br>  <br>Or not<br><br>Teh victimized reifag is the worst in all the evafag universe.</br></br></br>  <br><br>All I see are two waifufags unable to take responsibility for their shitposting in this thread, and god knows who many others. You can lie, cheat and spread your crazy defense and damage control as much as you'd like, everyone can look at threads like this one or others and conclude that you have no self-insight.<br><br>See this: <br><br>You are literally attacking each other and blaming each other because you won't take responsibility. I'm more convinced than ever it's asukafags and kaworufags now. Peace.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I only just started posting so the previous180 posts aren't me.<br><br>Insinuating such however, is a very reifag act. If you have been following the threads for the last few weeks, it's all been an autistic reifag or kowarufag. Recently however, there's been what I think is teh reifag posing as an asukafag but it's difficult to tell really.</br></br></br>  Reifags fucking hate talking about anything that isn't metashit.<br>Take a look at their /c/ threads, nothing but imagedumping. No discussion, nothing.<br>All they can comprehend is shitflinging at Asukafags because they're butthurt about 3.0.</br></br>  Asukafags, Reifags, Kaworufags, whatever...<br>There is only one waifu worth destroying humanity for.</br>  <br>Last I checked Anno could still take a dump in a Mason jar, slap Rei's face on it, and sell it for 2 to 300 hundred dollars. That doesn't sound like someone whose career has hit rock bottom to me.</br>  <br>You got the wrong girl there anon! Lemmie help</br>  <br> Take a look at their /c/ threads, nothing but imagedumping. No discussion, nothing. <br><br>You are so blinded by waifu war bullshit that you don't even realize that /c/ isn't a fucking board for discussion.</br></br></br>  <br>just another one of his pawns.<br>he literally destroyed the world for a chance to see Yui one more time. That should give you a small hint of her perfection.</br></br>  <br>If they don't discuss on /c/ and they don't discuss on /a/, then they don't discuss at all.<br>One Reifag actually told me once that they didn't have to discuss anything based on some shitty Megumi quote. Literally retarded.</br></br>  <br>Don't bother. They're so blind they don't realize everyone knows their waifu-war bullshit is the reasons threads hit rock bottom.</br>  <br>Yui never loved Gendo.</br>  <br>He created Rei(s) using her DNA too. He had the next best thing right there, so why destroy the world?</br>  <br> look at /c/ <br> a board meant for imagedumping <br> shocked they are imagedumping <br>This is the height of retardation</br></br></br></br>  <br>perhaps not, but that doesn't change what he did.</br>  <br> every Reithread OP says it encourages discussion <br> no one ever discusses anything <br>Compared to the threads of the other characterfags, my point stands.</br></br></br>  <br>Not that guy but it makes you retarded for not reading his entire post. I was there, and you got shown out like usual. Like the other poster points out, /c/ is not for discussion. Despite that I remember you being linked several threads which contained discussion, which you have apparently "forgotten".<br><br>Then also discussion is done here on /a/, and whenever I see legit Evangelion discussion - it's not a kaworufag doing it. It's someone posting images of Rei or the like.<br><br>When will you realize, if ever, that you're the big bad cancer? Whatever good there is in threads of discussion you quickly end with meta and waifu-war bullshit. I'll give you that this thread was lost from the get-go, but look at all the shitposting in this thread. Who is it? Kaworufags, Asukafags. Howling at eachother or anyone else.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>it also doesn't make her any less of a goddess.</br></br>  <br>Your point doesn't stand because you're a liar and everybody knows it.<br><br>A look at any of the other /c/ characterfag threads reveals there's less discussion than in the Rei-thread. Look at the OP, there's a pastebin with some pointers for you where there was or wasn't discussion.</br></br></br>  <br>Gendo didn't love Yui either. He just idealized and worshiped her. It wasn't genuine, which is why he never respected her wishes in taking care of Shinji.</br>  <br>That reifag isn't nearly as retarded as the Kaowshinfag <br><br><br><br><br><br>Who just shitposts nonstop to derail threads. Literal cancer. I don't even think Asukafags shitpost that much anymore. It's just fujoshits being butthurt about "waifufags" i.e anyone who calls them out for being retarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Rei-threads got in trouble for encouraging discussion actually. Mods/Janitors started deleting every post that had text in it to enforce "no-discussion", but that stopped since there were other threads that followed with discussion concerning board matters and characters.<br><br>see <br>also.</br></br></br></br>  <br>because deep down, he knew those soulless copies could never compare.</br>  <br>Wasn't this thread about Shinji in the first place?</br>  <br>Asukafags are definitely the worst. Look at this thread for proof. Asukafags are consistently retarded and there's only a few Kaworufags that shitpost (but do so intensively and have nervous breakdowns), and if the best you can do for Reifags is pretend there's a single Reifag among the hundreds of Reifags that frequent the board over a month, then we have our answer who's the least cancerous among those three. Reifags.<br><br>The rest of the fags are so few they hardly count.</br></br></br>  <br>Seems to be a bunch of crying reifagism to me in addition to the rest. <br><br>Nice how you exclude reifags which have repeatedly proven themselves to be the worst.</br></br></br>  <br>sage for evashit</br>  <br> muh asukafag propaganda <br>We literally have an Asukafag coming to these threads and admitting he shitposts. It's the same Asukafag that spends entire days shitposting on the fucking archive of the /waifu/ threads.<br><br>Reifags being on-topic about Evangelion and Rebuild is what you can't handle.</br></br></br></br>  <br>and what would you prefer to discuss on an anime image board?</br>  <br> Reifags being on-topic <br><br>With meta fanbase discussion and their victim-complex?</br></br></br>  And the thread once again delves into metashit. Time to post angle master race.  <br> Nice how you exclude reifags which have repeatedly proven themselves to be the worst. <br>They haven't, nor will they in the foreseeable future. Asukafags are so bad at times mods have to intervene and ban them. No Reifag ever stoops this low.<br><br>You're the worst because instead of addressing the subject at hand (how you are a blatant liar and shitty waifufag politician as the post proves), you cry "reifagism" as if hat would somehow clear the bullshit you just tried.<br><br>As for proving oneself the worst, you just did so. Again. I predict you'll do so all day every day until you break down like the Kaworufag did recently.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure half the 'asukafags" shitposting is just kawoshitters masquerading as asukafags <br>This "crackshipper" faggot was here <br>and here <br>Doesn't take long to find a pic off pixiv and pretend to be an x-fag. Ever since the generals you saw Kaworufags constantly starting ship wars about "crackpairings" because muh otp.</br></br></br></br>  Likely the reifag started this thread.    the arc where asuka got exposed as a second rate pilot was simply the best  <br>You're the one that makes it a fanbase-discussion and meta when you start bitching about it. You can talk Evangelion and about what it is without going there, so whenever you see someone complaining you go meta.<br><br>You blame and especially Reifags because you know they're not as bad as you are. See <br/></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> No Reifag ever stoops this low <br>See: </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're Asukafags, and you can't pretend they're otherwise.</br>  <br>You're the worst because you always blame someone else. You constantly invent or derail threads to be an asshat. Logic and reason can't be applied because you just make up BS and falsify information anyway.<br><br>You're doing it now. again and again.<br><br>Fuck off reifaggot, you cancerous sob. Worst of the worst.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, we literally have a KAWOSHINFAG coming to these threads and admitting she shitposts.</br>  <br> You're the one that makes it a fanbase-discussion and meta when you start bitching about it <br><br>Your original post is talking about some bogeyman Asukafag that ruins your threads. That's meta-discussion you cretin</br></br></br>  <br>You're stooping low right now.<br><br>You're taking a copy-pasta made by a non-reifag made to show dislike and disrespect for Rei, and then assuming it's a Reifag. It's also something completely different in nature to what I pointed out, i.e Asukafags misbehaving so badly they get banned.</br></br></br>  <br>The autistic Reifag literally cannot handle having an Eva discussion without resorting to metashit.<br>He brings the conversation to "ANNO HATES MUH REI FUCK 3.0" every time regardless of what the original topic was.<br>He lives for shitfling and meta, and you are most likely him if you have the nerve to defend that autist.</br></br></br>  <br> No, we literally have a KAWOSHINFAG coming to these threads and admitting she shitposts. <br>Yes, and an Asukafag earlier than that.<br><br><br>Uh, no? The post previously was meta.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please, reifags even threatened to kill Anno over their beloved waifu.<br><br>The worst. This thread just proves it again, like the others, for weeks and weeks.</br></br></br>  <br>Have you seriously missed all the shitposting fujoshis do and all their falseflagging? I am not saying NO asukafag shitposts, but the fact is fujoshis are pretending to be otherfags and shit stir as well.</br>  <br> i.e Asukafags misbehaving so badly they get banned. <br><br>Spammers get banned for spamming and shitposting it has nothing to do with the fact what X-fag you are</br></br></br>  <br>Are you retarded? If a Reifag doesn't say it, then an Asukafag or Kaworufag definitely will. Everyone fucking says it.<br><br>Pointing out that Anno hates Rei and doesn't care about it has been going on since forever.</br></br></br>  Maya Ibuki's japanese voice actress triggers ASMR response for me... so sublime.  <br><br><br>It is a Reifag. Reifags are mentally insane, see Reiheart for example. More news at 11.</br></br></br>    <br>You're grasping at straws really bad now.<br><br><br>They shitpost and spam in EVA-threads, which shows they're shitposters. Be butthurt about reality all you want. Maybe the mods'll get you one day too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The same one that pretends to be an Asukafag and uses his facade as a catalyst to substantiate a mythological Asukafag? You know it.</br>    A moratorium should be imposed on all Eva threads until we get new 3.0+1.0 info because this is becoming unbearable  <br><br><br> I-I'm going to ignore the existence of Reiheart because it proves me wrong! <br>Okay then, buddy.</br></br></br></br>  <br> potential <br>It's hardly "potential" when it's 100% of all Eva threads.<br> Kaworufags the worst not like Asuka fans (I'm not one btw)! <br> Asukafags are cancer not like Rei bros (I'm not one btw)! <br>  tehreitards are deluded fuckwads not like kaworufags (I'm not one btw)! <br><br>All of these subhuman shitbags deserve to be put in small fucking rooms with white phosphorus released through shower heads.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Here's how I know you're retarded:<br><br>You never respond to the argument, you just push your agenda nobody sane will believe, you lie without realizing how transparent you are, and expect anyone except yourselves to buy into it.<br><br>Evangelion threads carry on perfectly fine with Reifags, and when they do it only takes one asukafag or kaworufag to start bringing in meta. Every time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> which shows they're shitposters <br><br>Anyone can download a batch of chara pics from Nyaa or Pixiv and just spam the thread with a dynamic IP <br><br> Maybe the mods'll get you one day too. <br><br>I have been here for 10 years and never got an /a/ ban, because I don't do inane shitposting</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See I think so too, the reifag originally switched tactics about a week ago.</br>  <br>When will it end.</br>  <br>You really are grasping for straws. Picking at the tripfag from the generals just proved it.<br><br>Despite being a HUGE Reifag, that guy never, ever attacked anyone else or otherwise shat up the thread. The worst thing Reiheart ever did was explain how devastated and sad he was.<br><br>Compare that to yourself or the rest of the *fags in this thread.<br><br><br> Anyone can download a batch of chara pics from Nyaa or Pixiv and just spam the thread with a dynamic IP  <br>By that logic, the posters you claim are Reifags, Kaworufags can just as well be Asukafags falseflagging.<br><br>It was an Asukafag.<br><br> I have been here for 10 years and never got an /a/ ban, because I don't do inane shitposting <br>Yeah right.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It goes farther back than that, the rabbit hole doesn't end there.</br>    <br>You have at least 2 different people you are flaming.<br><br>If you had read my comments and those from the past weeks, you'd know why. There's no logic with you since all you want to do is flame. Why bother.</br></br></br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/126269<wbr>133/#126274877<br><br>Everyone knows about the Asukafag retard. Before that it was Asukafagget.<br><br>We've had tons of retarded Asukafags over the years.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br> By that logic, the posters you claim are Reifags, Kaworufags can just as well be Asukafags falseflagging. <br><br>This is actually true, I'm a hardcore Kaworufag and I've contributed to the Rei /c/ threads plenty of times. <br>You can even check the archive.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Asukafags falseflagging. <br>Falseflaging by attacking the Asuka fanbase? How does that make any sense? <br><br> Yeah right. <br>Yeah, I was here when you couldn't even have an Eva thread on /a/ without people spamming it calling the series pretentious garbage</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reiheart was retarded and pathetic but he never shitposted. Now you on the other hand are both retarded AND a shitposter. And that takes a lot of mental instability in itself.</br>  <br>How is presenting a bluff ("oh, if you had only BEEN there") logical at all?<br><br>I don't know which of the two you are I replied to but, if it's the latter than that's how logic looks like. If you can claim that posters that are asukafags to the bone somehow aren't by making up a fictional backstory for them with zero evidence, then can't everyone else do so to for whoever you claim is shitposting?<br><br>Your "logic" just has no weight to it anon. As far as I'm concerned, as well as every other onlooker, the source of the problem are a handful of posters that are asukafags and at least one kaworufag.<br><br><br> Falseflaging by attacking the Asuka fanbase? How does that make any sense?  <br>Please read the definition of what a false-flag is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>You mean, shitposting them like I've heard about. <br>I've never heard Reifags doing the same to Kaworufags.<br><br>That means, I guess, that you really are the worst.</br></br></br></br>  <br>toppest of lels</br>  <br>I never shitposted. Posting pictures of Rei and Kaworu together is not against the rules on /c/, just like posting pictures of Rei and Shinji together isn't.<br>What's the problem?</br></br>  <br> Everyone knows <br>You mean everyone knows you pretend to be him? You keep saying everyone knows and it's obvious as fuck you're trying to peddle your own narrative here given how distinct your rhetoric is. Just fuck off already, play pretend on the archives again.</br></br>  <br>See this as well:<br><br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128121<wbr>856/<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127106<wbr>709/<br><br>There is an extremely autistic asukafag who eggs other asukafags on in eva-threads, and who spends entire days all day shitposting on the archive as well. Everyone hates him in other threads too.</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> damage control <br>You are cancer. Just admit it. Every thread, every time.</br></br>  <br><br> Archive spammer is here </br></br>  Threadly reminder kaworufags will falseflag in order to divert attention from their shitposting and are insane  <br>I have no idea what you are rambling about. You, assuming you are the same person invents facts and ignores logic, invents whatever fucked up and twisted BS to further his or her aim which is nothing but trolling and shitting on EVA threads.<br><br>You make EVA threads to shit on, you hijack eva threads in which to shit. You are the worst of the worst. <br><br>Originally you claimed to be a reifag until suddenly last week you became an asukafag and I suspect a reifag/kaworufag too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> expecting anyone to load these monstrous threads <br>Thanks for the browser lag, faggot. Are you so retarded you catalogue your shitposting?</br></br>  <br>I guess you post kaworu there to annoy them? It would cost them no time or noteworthy amount of calories to go to a kaworu thread on /a/ and post images of Rei and Kaworu, maybe on the /cm/ thread too, but they don't.<br><br>I think that's where you should wake up and realize that you really are a nasty person.</br></br></br>  Watched EoE again. I know what the fuck I just watched, and it was bad.<br><br>I liked the imagery in the original series. Most of it was there to actually say something and served a purpose, it was nicely spread out and wasn't that jarring. Compare that to EoE. The second half is such a mess of pointless, meaningless symbolism it's ridiculous. What was the point of all the vaginas? What was with the experimental eva unit seppuku time shit? What was the point of the movie theater/stock footage segment? The movie throws so much pointless dense shit at you purely for shock value that despite it trying to seem deep comes off shallow as all fuck. Why does the pretentious wank that was EoE get so much praise?</br></br>  <br>He doesn't even load anything specific, just links the archives. What a terrible way to troll.</br>  <br>What the actual fuck are you talking about? Try posting again in a less retarded manner.</br>  <br><br><br>More damage control, just like I expected: </br></br></br>  <br>Try learning to read for comprehension and stop being a colossal faggot.</br>  1. Make inflammatory thread meant to shit on Asuka<br>2. Act surprised when Asukafags come into thread to defend her <br>3. Play the victim card<br>4. Shitpost about fanbases <br><br>The mystery is what do you hope to accomplish with these threads? Are you starved for attention or something? Does your uncle molest you?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would anyone need to damage control a nonspecific link to the archives of a waifu thread? Are you alright in the head?</br>  <br>Yeah I'm pretty sure spamming pictures of Kaworu in the Rei thread counts as shitposting. It's not against the rules to post Rei or Asuka in a Kaworu thread either, but doing so is clearly trolling.</br>  <br>It's fairly specific.<br>https://archive.moe/a/search/text/a<wbr>sukafag/ghost/only/page/3/<br><br>here it's really easy, you can get the entire history of the threads. There's literally an entire group of posters on /a/ that recognizes the asukafag and calls him out, just like most /eva/ threads.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Try actually responding to the post then. Is that too hard because you got wrecked?</br>  <br>Recently I just had to do the first one and the result was the same.</br>  <br>So, are you trying to prove his point that you pretend to be him or are you actually suggesting you have a huge boner for this guy and stalk him wherever he goes? Because both are pretty sad and pathetic.</br>   GOD TIER: <br>General Evafags<br>Reifags<br>Shinjifags<br> SHIT TIER <br>Asukafags<br>Kaworufags<br> BEYOND SHIT TIER <br>Marifags<br><br><br>and there it is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This obsession with the archive is 2 weeks old and is probably coming from the same person in every thread</br>  <br>Why does some stupid ass fictional cartoon character need you "saving her"? Why do people that define themselves by what character they have an obsession with infest eva threads the most of all other anime threads? The fuck is wrong with you retards? All of you. Reifags, kaworufags, asukafags, misatofags, you're all scum. You bring literally nothing positive to these threads.</br>  <br>Is it too hard for you to stop shit posting?</br>  <br><br>I post pictures of them together because I like them together and they have beautiful artwork. There's nothing nasty at work here.<br>Getting annoyed over that is irrational and stupid. <br>/cm/ only allows images of males anyway, so they'd get banned.<br><br>Look at my previous posts with that picture I posted, there never used to be any bad blood between Reifags and Kaworufags. What happened?<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/825547<wbr>50/#82588195<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/708251<wbr>55/#70825489<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/541488<wbr>20/#54155038</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I have no idea how /ghost/ works <br> /ghost/ is not at all for shitposting in any way <br>So, this reifag is extremely new as well?</br></br></br>  <br>The only people who like Asuka are the ones who haven't seen the original series in a long time and just remember what they see in cute fan art<br><br>She's objectively an insufferable cunt</br></br></br>  <br>Putting "asukafag" in the archive isn't exactly hard to do.<br><br>Are you mad you got exposed you dumb cuck?</br></br></br>  <br> there never used to be any bad blood between Reifags and Kaworufags. What happened? <br><br>3.0 happened</br></br></br>  <br>Probably because you shitpost their threads and used 3.0 as an opportunity to shitpost on /a/.</br>  <br>I wasn't around, but here I am again. In case that anon is still here:<br> It's obviously an attack on Rei if it belittles the character as a mere sex fantasy and claim that it's only point is to be a creepy child. <br><br>This guy  never said anything about her only point is to be a creepy child. He said he intended her to be a creepy child. I barely know anything about Anno's intentions, but it's obvious that Rei was supposed to be creepy at leat to some degree.<br>And no, I don't think she is creepy. To be that she has far too many cute and sympathetic scenes. But child rei, the many laughing Rei clones, etc. were definitely intended to be creepy.<br><br>For many people, she IS a mere sex fantasy, but that's because people are stupid and not because of Rei. It is not an insult aimed at Rei, but an insult aimed at her fanbase, which is fine by me.<br><br>And  again shat on her fanbase, which I really couldn't care less about. Almost every x-fag is insufferable and I won't participate in any X is better than Y discussion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're an insufferable cunt</br>  <br>I don't think anyone cares enough save for me to entertain your little conspiracy theory.<br><br> cuck <br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It is not an insult aimed at Rei, but an insult aimed at her fanbase, which is fine by me. <br>The fact that it's singling out the character and it's fans shouldn't be fine.</br></br>  <br>You could always learn how to bait better.</br>  <br>It might have something to do with your constant shitposting. Just a hunch. No one here really likes you.</br>  <br>These threads linked are from 2013.<br>Yes, I know the shit stain that is 3.0 did more harm than good on this fanbase, including the tumblr Kaworufags sliming their way over and starting shit.<br>But Kaworufags and Reifags got along fairly well in the past, I, who am fond of both characters am not going to suddenly start hating one because of a few bad eggs in the fanbase.<br>Shitflinging gets neither party nowhere.<br><br><br>I never shitposted. Check my previous posts with that picture, I'm dumping Rei in her birthday threads and supporting her against Asukafags in another. I am no enemy of yours.<br>https://archive.moe/a/search/image/<wbr>ph85VtoE4tP6etZC3JwWoQ/</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cuck </br>  <br> Look at my previous posts with that picture I posted, there never used to be any bad blood between Reifags and Kaworufags. What happened? <br><br>Well, Reifags used to be the only ones who tolerated you. You didn't contribute to discussion and you only talked shipping and that was that.<br><br>After 3.0 you became quite intolerable and defending 3.0 effectively meant you defended Rei getting shat on. Way to backstab, Kaworufag. You even twist the knife by going to /c/ to post Kaworu.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because it's the same spiteful Reifag.<br><br><br>Lines out two possibilities.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I never shitposted. <br><br>1- I don't believe you.<br>2- You said Kaworufags in general. You're not every Kaworufag and the Reifags ITT or in those thread aren't every Reifag.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't take this the wrong way but I have never seen a Kaworufag contribute anything to a discussion aside from shipping</br>  <br><br><br><br> this much damage-control </br></br></br></br>  Thread theme<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=M1L<wbr>mRjxGqls</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>What damage control? <br><br>Obsessing over the archive and these fanbase attacks are 2-3 weeks old, this is a fact</br></br></br>  <br> resorting to buzzwords when you got called out </br>  <br><br><br> Reifags used to be the only ones who tolerated you. <br>That's not quite right.<br><br>But I understand if the more vocal Kaworufags strike you the wrong way, I can't control their actions.<br>I'm only a bit displeased at how the fanbase interactions have changed so drastically over the years. And that KawoRei is apparently no longer allowed on /c/ when it used to be commonplace.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah keep going it's very convincing.</br></br>  <br>Am I being had here? You're going to tell me you're only pretending to be retarded in a few posts here, yes?<br><br><br> using that tripfag as a metric for anybody </br></br></br></br>  <br>Now I'm hungry you bastard</br>  <br>Refusing to accept you've done something wrong just makes it worse.</br>  <br> ARK  <br><br>Please no, I will forever regret the day I told him to get a trip</br></br></br>  <br> I have no idea how post timers work <br>Christ this guy really is fairly new.<br><br><br>Your fault for arguing in favor of sequel theory. Now I guess we all have to deal with the consequences of your actions.</br></br></br></br></br>  Everybody in Eva is a "pussy whining faggot who can't do anything". That's the entire point of the show.  <br> That's not quite right. <br>Oh it's quite right actually. ARK there has more posts bashing Kaworu, the one you have there is more meant as a joke, and Asuka fans in general can't stand ARK.<br><br>If you're displeased, then you have to take blame for it yourself. If you know KawoRei or whatever else you posted might tick people off, and you still do it, you're being a dick.<br><br>Also consider other things that have happened.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the only thing I haven't done wrong is choose to engage in post-3.0 threads once in a blue moon. <br>Clearly there's nothing constructive going on here but massive shitflinging.</br></br>  <br>Why would I like or tolerate someone who more or less lives to see Rei shat on? Because that's what Kaworufags and Asukafags are. <br><br>Before you say that not everyone is like that, then that hardly matters when they do nothing but stay quiet.</br></br></br>  <br>Then you've done a lot of wrong, haven't you?</br>  Shinjifags are good evafags. I mean the ones who isn't that buttfuck crazy kawoshin shipper or shipper in general  <br>It's is not singling out her character. These are statements about her fanbase. If he says Reifags shit on other characters the most, it doesn't mean that for example Asukafags don't shit on others. They might as well be 2nd place. The thing is, I don't know or care.<br>I don't know if Reifags shit on other characters the most. The only thing I know is that there is nothing to gain over stupid waifu wars, so you can insult those who participate as much as you want.<br><br>Who are worse: Reifags? Asukafags? Shinjifags? Kaworufags?<br>I don't know, so I won't make any statements about it. All I know is that I don't want to participate in that sort of discussion.<br><br>Now, if you were to talk about the characters or the plot of eva instead of its different fanbases, then I'm all for it.<br>I don't hate any of eva's characters and I love discussing their ups and downs. To try to understand why people love or hate them. How they relate to them or whatever. But sadly, none of this is happening.<br><br>But that's enough meta shit for now. I'm gone, bye.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Post 3.0 threads had a lot of argumented dismantling of 3.0 going on in them <br><br>It wasn't mindless shitflinging by any means</br></br></br>  I give Asuka a pass for her behaviour because she had a hard life. When your mother goes insane, doesn't recognise you, attempts to strangle you then hangs herself in front of you, you're going to be messed up. In comparison Shinji had a fairly easy life.<br><br>Asuka also had a worse experience during most of the show, what with the mental degradation due to failing to meet her own expectations, mind rape and eventually being eaten alive. How could you not feel sorry for her?</br></br>  <br>It became mindless shitflinging this year when we got some autistic asukafags and kaworufags attacking every post dissing 3.0 or criticizing it calling them reifags.</br>  <br>Fair enough. <br>Perhaps it's unfair of me to ask you see me in a better light considering there's been quite a few Kaworuautists shitposting lately. <br>I don't engage in these threads too often as I'm sure you can see why, they've all been utter shit and completely fruitless the past three years especially in terms of discussion (or lack, thereof).<br>Then again, I'm not about to go police Kaworufags just because they like the same character as I do. What they do isn't really my business, and I don't think they're the same people who have been here since the beginning.<br><br><br>Mostly referring to blogshit in real life, not here.<br><br><br>Of course not all of them have been shit, I've lurked a fair good number. But the majority are nothing to speak highly of.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I will leave this phone wallpaper because some guy around here needs it.  <br>Shinji also lost his mother in front of his eyes. Then his father abandoned him and left him with someone else.<br><br>Asuka lost her mother, but was given purpose and direction in life with the EVA-project as well as foster-parents.<br><br>Rei never had a mother or a father, but Gendo serves as a parental figure and he's the worst dad ever.<br><br>Asuka had it the best of the three.<br><br>Plus she got training, Shinji got NONE before he started. Then Shinji got mindraped more times than Asuka, Leliel and then getting absorbed into EVA01.<br><br>It's not that Asuka doesn't deserve pity, but compared to Shinji and Rei she's just a spoilt brat.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>better theme:<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9pWF<wbr>g32smBQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  I want Rebuild final to be EoE-tier just so I can see /a/ lose its complete shit.  <br> and he's the worst dad ever. <br>Not to Rei he isn't. Shinji even gets jealous at their relationship <br><br> Plus she got training <br>Eva training is mostly pointless, Shinji also had Yui-hax on his side <br><br> Shinji and Rei she's just a spoilt brat. <br>All the pilots were in the same boat more or less. <br><br> Can't wait for you to start your tirade about Asuka having a great relationship with her step-mom  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But anon, we just had this discussion two days ago or something and you didn't fly so good.</br>  <br>They've been decent some times, it's only this year they've become irredeemably bad.<br><br>Let me ask you another question then; if you believe it's not your business to care, why do you pretend to care now? It's shit like this, this two-faced attitude that make me so negative towards Kaworufags.<br><br>On the grander scale of things, Kaworu has become the Kryptonite to Rei's Superman in the new-canon re-imagining of the evangelion universe. There's a disparity and specific choices made that make it impossible to understand and enjoy both except on the aesthetic level. As a Rei-fan, I go beyond the aesthetic and even consider the innards of the characters working with the narrative.<br><br>Being a genuine fan of Rei while also liking Kaworu should be impossible at this point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I want Rebuild final to be EoE-tier <br>Yeah that's not happening</br></br>  <br> better theme <br>Except this shit is nothing else but comical. The fact that eva threads manage to be even more pathetic than Madoka threads despite the latter being fueled by nothing other than a purely yuri bait movie is just baffling.</br></br>  <br>I like the second half of that, BGM III I think<br><br><br>Asuka and Shinji are functionally the same. I mean she saw her mother hang herself right in front of her, for fucks sake, and while we don't know much about her father just about everything implies it wasn't a happy family life. She did eventually come to cordial terms with her stepmom, but it took a lot of effort on Asuka's part to act like a "normal girl" it seems.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i'm just trying to elevate the discussion, rather than drag it down. don't fight cancer with cancer.</br>  <br> Not to Rei he isn't. Shinji even gets jealous at their relationship  <br>Only because he's sore his dad abandoned him. Shinji gets less jealous once he realizes it isn't all it's cracked up to be, something Rei informs him. Shinji is jealous of Asuka's familial relationship with her foster parents and says so directly.<br><br> Eva training is mostly pointless, Shinji also had Yui-hax on his side  <br>It's not pointless, there's mental and physical preparations. There's less fear, uncertainty involved.

But I don't like Rebuild or even consider it any semblance near worthy of affection my perception of Kaworu and Rei as they were in NGE/EoE. My love for them won't change no matter what crawls out of Anno's defecating ass and calls itself Eva in the future.<br>Although I suppose easier said than done for others like yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Litteraly 35Years ago <br>You autists still fight about which fanbase who is the most retarded</br>  <br>Best Eva.</br>  <br> That Rei has a lot of her own issues. You still can't deny that Rei had a pretty good relationship with Gendo considering who we are talking about.  <br>I can deny it because as everyone can tell it's a downright abusive relationship that has left Rei emotionally stunted. Even Rei herself knows Gendo isn't as genuine. The show makes a point of how Rei was never thankful to Gendo, and in the end we've got Rei antagonizing Gendo to finally rob him of his victory in the final stretch of the story.<br><br>Gendo is all things considered, as a parent and as the Commander of NERV responsible for any damage done to Rei's psyche and body, this includes several injuries and broken bones in addition to any and all experiments run on her since childhood in the series. Being a lab-rat isn't good parenting. <br><br>Remember that Rei lives all alone in a dirty apartment, and before that she lived alone at the bottom of NERV. <br><br> To fight an enemy you can't be prepared for because you know nothing about him. Yeah I would take God-mode Yui over "training" every day of the week  <br>Asuka is more prepared than Shinji is, and Shinji isn't aware Yui is there. That's why your point is irrelevant because it has no influence over how they understand things or deal with them. <br><br>To fight said enemy you need training, of which Shinji had none but Asuka had. That's a better starting point.<br><br> What? <br>What?<br><br><br> Yet the core issues for them is the same.  <br>Irrelevant, because the only thing that matters is how they deal with the trauma. There's a saying: the same boiling water which softens the potato hardens the egg.<br><br>This is the crux of the issue here when we deal with their differences; and it clearly shows that Asuka has a better time yet can deal with less. You can even argue that's why, because she's had a better life than Shinji (or Rei) she gets more distraught at failures.<br><br>Hence, she's relatively spoiled compared to Shinji and Rei.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> still fight about which fanbase who is the most retarded <br>I thought it was decided ages ago. The Neon Genesis Evangelion fanbase.</br></br>  <br> can't even defend his shitty fag Eva <br>Alright then.</br></br>  <br> being fueled by nothing other than a purely yuri bait movie is just baffling <br>And Evafags are being fueled by nothing other than purely yaoi bait movie. What's your point?</br></br>  <br>What is there to defend? Its perfection goes beyond words.</br>  <br>Here's my hypothesis: you can pretend to be accepting because you don't actually care about Rei or the rest of Evangelion.<br>Hence you can be aware of the kryptonite-factor yet still accept it.<br><br>I postulate on that basis that if it were the other way around, you'd be very unhappy right now.<br>I also demand that to prove your own honesty, you would have to crave and demand the reversing of the kryptonite-situation so that Rei is the Kryptonite to Kaworu's superman. This is the only thing that would create any effect of upheaval. To prove nothing would phase you, you should actively crave this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My point is unlike Madoka "fans" who only have 12 episodes of poorly paced overdone drama and one trashy movie, Eva fans have a brilliant series, a good movie, and speculation of new upcoming Michael Bay tier movies for discussion, and yet the former still manages to keep up better quality threads.</br>  <br><br> What is there to defend <br>Nothing, nothing at all. I wouldn't be caught dead defending such poor taste. Off yourself you image flooding fucktard.</br></br></br>  <br>I have god-tier taste, though. That's why I acknowledge the perfection of best Eva.</br>  <br>Because Madoka is an honest, straight-forward series. You can argue dips in quality here and there, but it's not (yet) a franchise plagued by endless spinoffs that serve only to instigate waifu war. Every bit of the mainline Madoka-series, even the latest movie still manages to keep it's integrity intact despite allowing some character more or less focus. <br><br>Case in point: Homura, who is now become a form of villain in the universe, this is done without denigrating the character or likening it to something appalling or disgusting, it retains it's agency throughout the movie and gains screentime and fleshing out that improves the character. It was honest development, despite it being grim.<br><br>The last real hope for a true Evangelion was Rebuild and we all saw where that went. Some of us were actually waiting, you know.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The show makes a point of how Rei was never thankful to Gendo <br>The show actually makes a point to show that she was. <br><br> She keeps his broken glasses with her because they give her comfort <br> Rei defends Gendo in front of Shinji  <br> Gendo sends Rei to school  <br> Gendo has dinner with Rei  <br> Gendo is the last person Rei sees before she dies at the hands of Armisael  <br> Gendo sacrifices Ritsuko in order to protect Rei  <br> Rei retrieves Gendo's glasses during Instrumentality  <br><br>You are under the false impression that Rei had the possibility of a better life then the one Gendo gave her. This is false, as far as SEELE was concerned she should have been kept in Terminal Dogma force-fed through a tube and thrown at Angels just to gauge their abilities. <br><br>SEELE is even irritated by Gendo's treatment of Rei.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You have shit-tier taste and are only replying to dump more images of a shit Eva. You are adding nothing to the thread but images of that shittily designed piece of trash. Fuck off. Global 10 you oblivious faggot.</br>  <br> serve only to instigate waifu war <br><br>Now I haven't see the movies because idgf about Madoka but didn't they turn Sayaka into a lesbian because "muh yuri" although it makes zero fucking sense for her to be one?</br></br></br>  <br>Not in any movie I've watched.</br>  <br> Hence you can be aware of the kryptonite-factor yet still accept it. <br>There isn't anything I can do about it. <br>I have a life beyond Anime, I'm not going to fly to Japan and scream at Anno like some crazed lunatic.<br>Yes, I am unhappy in regards to Rebuild and the situation regarding Rei's character (And everyone elses character as well, mind you). But what can I do? <br>Shitpost on /a/ for eternity? I have obligations and responsibilities in the real world, I don't have the time nor resources to do such. And what is complaining on a western image board going to do, anyway? Nothing, that's what.<br><br>Here's what I do: I watch NGE/EoE. If I ever get unhappy about Rei or Rebuild, I simply watch NGE/EoE and become content once more. <br>How she's portrayed there cannot be taken away, cannot be retconned, no matter what the future of Eva becomes. <br>I find this to be a much more constructive and beneficial alternative to complaining on /a/, which results in absolutely nothing but more anger and hate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Funny how things change, huh?</br>  <br> The show actually makes a point to show that she was. <br>Then you don't know the show well enough. There's a scene where Rei reflects over the fact that she's never felt thankful to Gendo. It's the scene in pic related.<br><br> You are under the false impression that Rei had the possibility of a better life then the one Gendo gave her. <br>There's no false impression, and you're actually claiming Rei doesn't have the right to a fulfilling life, which makes you quite fucked up.<br><br>Nothing that could be considered Rei's responsibilities would interfere with Gendo giving Rei a full life.<br><br>While you claim Gendo protects Rei, Rei herself as well as any viewer paying attention knows that he does it to further his own motives. Hence Rei points this out once or twice in the series, claiming that Gendo is using her and will abandon her.<br><br>She was right, and so am I.<br><br>When Rei keeps Gendo's broken glasses despite the above, it's to show you in physical terms what Rei already explained in episode six: she has nothing else. <br>Therefore what little she has is precious. <br><br>Then what happened with those glasses in the end? Rei destroyed them to symbolize her not being able to take it any more.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I have obligations and responsibilities in the real world <br><br>LeL what a fucking loser</br></br></br>  <br>What I wouldn't give to be able to lazily sit on my ass all day and watch Anime.</br>  <br>The best. Simply the best.</br>  <br>and eat it too!</br>  <br>All of us have lives beyond anime.  or so I like to believe <br><br>That said, I'm now convinced my hypothesis is right. Why?<br><br>Because of several things, the first being that you claim to be concerned about the state of current Evangelion-threads and now intervene to make it end, yet personally don't have any issues with or intent to address what fuels them, i.e Rebuild.<br><br>The second is that you pretend that ignoring it is a solution. You can't be watching Rebuild and then shut your brains and heart off to what you're seeing. Since you're dealing with a fanbase, (which is what you're complaining about), then these people like you say, is beyond your control. Like anything else, the portrayal of Rei in NGE is effectively overwritten by the new, as it has happened for all of Evangelion. The original is still there, but it is less relevant and prone to re-interpretation in light of the new. You already have half the fanbase thinking Rei's character ended completely at episode 6.<br><br> I find this to be a much more constructive and beneficial alternative to complaining on /a/, which results in absolutely nothing but more anger and hate. <br>So far? It didn't work. It's convincing me that even Kaworufags who in a best case scenario attempts to be serious are really no different from the ones that don't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> keep its integrity. <br>By demolishing a perfect ending with closure and replacing it with a shitty cliffhanger, throwing down yuri bait, needlessly trying to one-up the series with the idea of "bigger and more epic = better" all for the sake of profit is somehow retaining integrity? The series was a simple "deal with the devil" story with Homura trying to save someone she cares about from a shitty destiny. It was simple, it was concise, it had good emotional delivery and ended on a perfect bittersweet note, with the crazy universe bending shit being merely a conclusion. Then the following movie shits all over that by introducing the dual existence bullshit, turning Homura into a comical yandere saturday morning cartoon villain, more pointless universe mangling shite and no plot to actually get emotionally invested in. Apart from the inciting of shipping battle garbage, it's practically on the same level as the rebuilds. Completely devoid of the charm the series had.</br></br>  <br> It's the scene in pic related. <br>Yeah no, she says she never said "Thank you" to Gendo, she never uttered the words that's all <br><br> and you're actually claiming Rei doesn't have the right to a fulfilling life <br> which makes you quite fucked up. <br>I'm just being realistic here, fact is that Rei was a project of SEELE/NERV and her expandability was her main asset. There was no reason for Gendo to do the things he did for Rei other then him wanting to do them. <br><br>As far as SEELE was concerned Rei was nothing more then an experiment, she had no rights. <br><br> she has nothing else <br>And she wouldn't even have that if Gendo didn't go out of his way to provide it for her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>              <br> Yeah no, she says she never said "Thank you" to Gendo, she never uttered the words that's all  <br>Exactly, but she could utter them to Shinji. There's never been a case where Rei has felt thankful enough to do that.<br><br> I'm just being realistic here, <br>You're not being realistic as much as you're being dismissive. In truth, there is nothing that says either Shinji or Asuka should be given foster parents either. If anything, they should have been beaten, disciplined and trained like dogs to ensure maximum efficiency. Let's not be that sort of pessimist-realist. <br><br> There was no reason for Gendo to do the things he did for Rei other then him wanting to do them.  <br>There was, that being the fact that Gendo was since the start planning to use Rei for his own scenario.<br><br> As far as SEELE was concerned Rei was nothing more then an experiment, she had no rights.  <br>There is nothing from SEELE ever says or does that implies this even being slightly true. You're being extremely dismissive here, you're advocating your personal opinion by projecting it on SEELE or NERV.<br><br> And she wouldn't even have that if Gendo didn't go out of his way to provide it for her. <br>Which tells us two things:<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128570428#p128596960">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Precure Thread   Dead stream was the pits.

She may be considered a rain-bringer for crops.<br><br> In modern usage in Japan, "ameonna" (or the male equivalent "ameotoko") refers to an unlucky person that seems to be jinxed to have the rain follow them wherever they may go, thus gaining a reputation for ruining special events such as weddings or sporting events. </br></br></br></br>  <br>But she was healing him with Kido.</br>  <br>she can do both.<br><br>Btw i found minazuki<br><br>The Bake-kujira (化鯨?, literally "ghost whale") is a mythical Japanese yōkai (ghost, phantom, or strange apparition) from western Japan.

They are usually pictured as unnaturally beautiful women dressed in ornate, colorful kimonos (traditionally in five colors), exquisite jewelry, and flowing scarves that wrap loosely around their bodies. They usually carry lotus blossoms as a symbol of enlightenment or play musical instruments such as the biwa, or flute.[2][3]<br><br>Tennin are believed to live in the Buddhist heaven as the companions to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Some legends[citation needed] also make certain tennin solitary creatures living on mountain peaks. Pilgrims sometimes climb these mountains in order to meet the holy spirits.<br><br>Tennin can fly, a fact generally indicated in art by their colored or feathered kimonos, called hagoromo ("dress of feathers").[1] In some legends, tennin are unable to fly without these kimonos (and thus cannot return to heaven).[4] More rarely, they are shown with feathered wings.[2] In a Noh play Hagoromo, which bears a number of similarities to the Western swan maiden legends,[5] tennyo come to the earth and take off their hagoromo. A fisherman spies them and hides their clothes in order to force one to marry him. After some years he tells his wife what he did, and she finds her clothes and returns to heaven.[4] The legend says it occurred on the beach of Miho no Matsubara, now a part of the city of Shizuoka.<br> So that's the origin of Kyorakus kimono </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  daily reminder of best gril  <br>i beg to differ</br>  holy fuck. i found yachiru<br><br>According to folklore, to attract and maintain a zashiki warashi in the home it is said that "the spirit must be noticed, appreciated and cared for properly, much in the manner one would raise a child, though too much attention may drive it off." As the zashiki warashi is child-like in nature, it is prone to playing harmless pranks and occasionally causing mischief. They might, for instance, "sit on a guest's futon, turn people's pillows over or cause sounds similar to kagura music to be heard from rooms no one uses."[citation needed] Sometimes they leave little footsteps in ashes. There are different variations as to who can see the zashiki warashi; usually this is limited to inhabitants of the house, sometimes to children.[citation needed]<br><br>The appearance of this spirit is that of a 5 or 6 year child with bobbed hair and a red face. Zashiki warashi can be found in well-maintained and preferably large old houses. It is said that once a zashiki warashi inhabits a house, it brings the residence great fortune; on the other hand, should a zashiki warashi depart, the domain soon falls into a steep decline.</br></br></br></br>    <br>h-how did you do that?</br>  <br><br><br>Uryuu<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azure<wbr>_Dragon</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Basic Photoshop shit.<br><br>Spliff from google, cropped with the polagonal lasso tool.<br>Smoke.png, straight from google, slapped over the top, opacity lowered.<br>Tie Dye, straight from google, slapped over the top and opacity lowered again.<br>Red-Eye, literally drawn over the whites of the eye using basic brush tool on 100% hardness, then I just lowered the opacity again.<br><br>Real mature of me, but I couldn't resist.<br>Rukia really looked blazed as fuck in this specific frame.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i mean the<br><br><br><br><br><br>420</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Uryuu's theme song<br><br>"Idioteque" by Radiohead<br><br>Who's in bunker, who's in bunker?<br>Women and children first<br>Women and children first<br>Women and children<br>I'll laugh until my head comes off<br>I swallow till I burst<br>Until I burst<br>Until I..<br><br>Who's in bunker, who's in bunker<br>I've seen too much<br>I haven't seen enough<br>You haven't seen enough<br>I'll laugh until my head comes off<br>Women and children first<br>And children first<br>And children..<br><br>Here I'm allowed, everything all of the time<br>Here I'm allowed, everything all of the time<br><br>Ice age coming, ice age coming<br>Let me hear both sides<br>Let me hear both sides<br>Let me hear both..<br><br>Ice age coming, ice age coming<br>Throw me in the fire<br>Throw me in the fire<br>Throw me in the..<br><br>We're not scaremongering<br>This is really happening, happening<br>We're not scaremongering<br>This is really happening, happening<br><br>Mobiles working<br>Mobiles chirping<br>Take the money and run<br>Take the money and run<br>Take the money..<br><br>Here I'm allowed, everything all of the time<br>Background:<br>The first of the children</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>...I didn't fucking realize...<br>Holy shit.</br></br>  <br>srsly?<br><br><br>Random fact<br>A hairy kappa is called a Hyōsube (ひょうすべ?).</br></br></br></br></br>  fuck i just found this too.<br><br>Kyōkotsu – A skeletal figure that emerges from a well.</br></br>  <br>a picture of the Jorogumo</br>  <br><br> Kyokotsu expanded.<br><br>http://hyakumonogatari.com/tag/seve<wbr>red-heads/</wbr></br></br></br></br>  Mother of fucks<br><br>If you wake up after a restless night, with reeking breath and gasping for air—beware! You might have had a visit from the breath-stealing Kurobozu; the Black Monk.<br><br>What Does Kurobozu Mean?<br><br>It doesn’t get less complicated than this! 黒 (Kuro; Black) + 坊主 (Bozu; Monk). As with many yokai, the “monk” part does not have any particular religious meaning. Many yokai have this as part of their name, which could just as easily mean “stranger.” Kurobozu is also used as an alternate name for other yokai like the umibōzu and takabozu.<br><br>During the Edo period, classes and traveling were high restricted. Most were not permitted to leave their home town, and posted waypoints on the road rigorously checked passports to make sure everyone stayed put. Itinerant monks were one of the few classes allowed free travel, so they were often the only unfamiliar faces who ever wandered into town.<br><br>That and the bald heads. Almost every yokai with “bozu” in its name is inevitably bald.<br><br>What Does a Kurobozu Look Like?<br><br>Aside from the bald head, the Kurobozu is depicted as vaguely human-like, although shrouded in a pitch black monk’s robe. It is like a living shadow. Its head is featureless, except for the vague appearance of  two eyes that sometimes reflect the light . The lack of face leads some to consider the Kurobozu to be a type of Nopperabo.<br><br>Based on the two types of Kurobuzo stories, the images are often merged into a bear-like monster wrapped in a monk’s robes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But he wore a different haori when Lisa was around, it was still pink, but the pattern was definitely different, meaning he changes those through years.</br>  https://play.google.com/store/apps/<wbr>details?id=com.klab.bleach</wbr>  <br>She invited travellers for a drink an if they refused she would kill them.

I heard that they lost his script or something? Any details? I was excited for this movie, but as I was watching it I knew there was something wrong, it felt more like the kind of thing the anime would write for a filler and not something that would actually fit into the story. The part that bothered me the most was Ichigo tapping into rape mode by getting angry, then Renji cuts his horn in the middle of a Cero just like Ulquiorra and uses a Kido spell to send him out. Renji, the guy that can't use a low level spell.</br>  <br>Bleach has actually lost popularity on /a/, mainly due to the flood of narutards that infested /a/ when it ended. They spread to Bleach threads and pretty much killed them.</br>  <br>you'd think they would trust the guy who created their cash cow to write a fucking movie wouldnt you? they guy must have sold millions of manga around the world.</br>  <br>Fade to Black is good. Memories of Nobody is too. Hellverse is pretty shit same with Diamond dust rebellion</br>  <br>I think that Bleach is already in the top 10 all time best selling manga. But Studio Pierrot prefers their own shitty uncreative writers to repeat the same shit that has already happened in the anime and fillers.</br>  <br>what the fuck was her bankai.</br>  <br> confirmed for making shit up <br><br>The only issues in bleach threads are the orihime shitposter/s</br></br></br>  <br><br>Hell Verse is great, don't let the other faggots tell you otherwise.<br><br>It is worth a watch.

Just as you're doing right now.<br><br>Fuck off nigger.</br></br></br>  <br>Hell verse is good if you acknowledge Ichigo to be the villain.<br><br>Kokuto was a bro who was transformed into a monster only because of a fucked up system. Ichigo only serves to keep the status quo, and for that he is forgiven something even worse that Kokuto did. Kokuto only took pleasure in avenging his sister, Ichigo almost killed millions after the loss of her sister.</br></br></br>  <br>Ichigo is a selfish teenager because he solely thinks of the safety of his loved ones. Sure?<br><br>It is a fucking shounen, logic and reason are the top priority for most MC protags.</br></br></br>  <br>are NOT top priority I should say<br><br>if you did not get the sarcasm</br></br></br>  <br>Memories of Nobody is the best</br>  <br>Bleach threads have most definitely lost popularity and post quality for months now. It's probably because all the Rukiafriends left.</br>  <br>troll harder himefag pork cunt.</br>  <br> muh porky boogeyman <br> irrelevent boogeyman for shitposters <br>I want you autistic shitposting-kun faggots to leave.</br></br></br>  <br>fuck off back to bleach asylum. please consider killing yourself.</br>  <br>Fade to Black is slightly better</br>  <br>I love those games, they were so awesome</br>  Twelfth Division Recruitment interview with Mayuri.<br><br> What kind of individuals are you seeking? <br><br>Anyone is fine.<br><br> How would you describe the atmosphere around your division? <br><br>It's a very fun place.<br><br> What do you require of new recruits? <br><br>Healthy bodies.<br><br> Some words for the Shinigami recruits. <br><br>Just come.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  bump  <br>Shit taste</br>  <br> How would you describe the atmosphere around your division? <br> It's a very fun place <br><br>What a sick bastard</br></br></br></br>  <br>full of reanimated corpses and fucking reiatsu amplifiers not to mention the head of soken ishida</br>  <br>Reminder that Orihime sucks dick</br>  <br>i wouldnt say no to her doing it to mine.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>here, have at it</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>wat leviathan sama?</br>  <br>just got a jap friend to translate.

It's an informal way to refer to a person, so "guy" is a typical translation, but the implications of its use are all totally different from those of "guy" in English. There are culturally specific character types and voices tied to やつ that "guy" doesn't imply in English. But "guy" is about as close is functional.</br>  Why do Arrancars have surnames?

The god awful light novel tried to explain it. I forget the exact details but Szayel was Espada 0, then fucked around with science to make himself perfect, wound up reduced to a powerless version of Szayel that couldn't even rank in the Espada anymore, and then Illfort was somehow born in that process. Then some nonsense about his perfect form turned into its own consciousness and became Privaron 100, I think?<br><br>Shit was dumb fanfic tier garbage. Though it did give us Kubo's illustrations of nurse arrancar and her resurreccion, so it wasn't a total loss. Oh but terrible kenpachi legacy shit was in there too.</br></br></br>  <br> Though it did give us Kubo's illustrations of nurse arrancar and her resurreccion <br><br>You mean the one that Yammy killed for no fucking reason?</br></br></br>  <br>Unohana must have given up the mantle of kenpachi after zaraki beat her up. they must have just drawn a line under it and started with a new kenpachi that wasnt either of them.</br>  <br>yeah, her name turned out to be Roka Paramia, and her Resurreccion is Teleraña.</br>  <br>oh it confirmed 2 additional kenpachi's other than the big guy from the turnback the pendulum era. both looked perfectly generic and uninteresting. One was a siscon.</br>        <br><br>yeah i heard about them. its not considered canon though is it?</br></br>  Oh and then the Privaron 102 turned out to be a bunch of little kids that all looked like rejected Nel designs. They had bug wings and were collectively referred to as Picaro.  <br>Whats to ruin?<br>What positive reputation does it have left? Most readers can no longer stomach Kubo's garbage plot twists. The series reads more like a comedy now. I guess you can say it can only go up from here.</br></br>  <br> millions sold <br> garbage <br><br>Deal with it faget.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Sternritter are so fucking unforgettable.

Poe's law.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Are the novels really that bad? From what I have heard, it sounds like an excuse for a Kenpachi fanboy to make money on it. It has the previous Kenpachis casting a thousand level 90s spells, challenging the Royal Guards and overwhelming Aizen, then current Kenpachi beats them with no difficulty, or so I've read. It all looks and sounds really terrible, but I want to know details, if it's just this or there's more shit in there.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's by the Durarara and Baccano guy, so it's probably good but bonkers.</br>  <br> forgettable <br><br>I like you</br></br></br>  <br>an army of arrancar child soldiers wouldve been decent.</br>  Characters who singlehandedly ruined the anime they appeared in        <br>She was best girl</br>    <br> not Inami <br>oh boy</br></br>  <br><br> Inami <br><br>Why would best girl ruin the series?</br></br></br></br>  <br>She literally ruined season 1</br>  <br>yamada-san....Yamada-San.....YAMADA<wbr>_SAN!!!!</wbr></br>  <br>At least the threads were fun, kinda</br>  <br> Inami <br> best girl <br><br>Sorry for your taste, anon.</br></br></br></br>  Nao from Charlotte<br>More like everyone else except for the MC.</br>    <br>What?

But it was Slaine who "singlehandedly ruined the anime".<br><br>Shithime was asleep half the time, the other half she was with Inaho.</br></br></br>  <br>worse than hitler</br>  <br>It was already shit. I appreciated and fantasized about her putting her legs on my dick, same with the girl that was close to the MCs.<br><br>Didn't mind the character at all.<br><br><br>Why did you post Slain instead of Inaho?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The lesbian from Ben-to<br><br>and those 2 sisters were pretty annoying too i guess</br></br>  <br>Inaho saved the world and was completely inoffensive<br>Slaine was a retard for no reason 90% of the time and ruined many people's lives, even down to a poor crippled girl</br></br>  <br>Inaho was a completely unrealistic and annoying as fuck gary stu, pretty much the worst thing that can be included in a modern anime.<br><br>Don't know all that shit about Slaine cause I dropped it after the first season ended and Inaho survived getting shot in the eye point blank.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean saved. Inami ruined the show and luckily Yamada carried it on her back.</br>    This fucking piece of shit  <br>The show would literally not exist without her. <br><br>Kuroneko on the other hand straight up ruined S2.</br></br></br>  This faggot could have used a major personality overhaul.  Waste of screentime  <br>Why all the hate on Near? He just showed up and did what he was supposed to do. It's not his fault Light became a deranged idiot, got sloppy, and fell into his lap. Near was a pretty great guy all things considered, he was super smart and succeeded where L and everyone else failed.</br>  <br>Spot on.<br>Kirino a shit.</br></br>  <br>Bet you've never read the VN, have you?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=H2q<wbr>NFdjE_AM</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>You beat me to it.<br>Given that the series is pretentious as fuck, that obnoxious fucker ruined the entire VN for me. I tried to watch the adaptation but I couldn't take him for more than 10 episodes.</br></br>  <br>Everyone in AZ was unrealistic. In terms of ruining absolutely everything, Slaine takes the cake by being a plot device made for making bad decisions. Good on you for ignoring S2.</br>    <br>Here we go again.</br>  <br>honestly, I can see why people would hate Shirou. You kind of have to like simple people with simple goals to like him,  at least until Heaven's Feel </br>  <br>Fuck you faggot</br>    The epitome of worst girl and show ruiner.<br><br>Claire a SHIT.</br></br>  <br> You kind of have to like simple people with simple goals <br>I like simple people with simple goals. Its just that Shirou over exaggerates that simple goal as the most important thing in the universe that makes it extremely fucking annoying. Literally one of the most pretentious characters I have ever experienced.</br></br>  This cumguzzler  <br>So you a Light worshipper?</br>  <br>Himeji please</br>  <br>Ruined a franchise</br>  <br><br>How can best girl ruin a show?</br></br>  <br> being retarded </br>  <br>You forgot we aren't on tumblr fujo.</br>  <br>How can su be so much of a faggot?</br>  <br>That's not Shinji.</br>    <br>This. What a stupid drama queen and hateable bitch.

Everything else about it was completely fine.</br>  <br>Fuck you nigger.</br>  <br><br><br>Bingo.</br></br></br>    <br>Edgy Two Hand sounds like a really lewd game.</br>    <br>You delusional fuck</br>  <br>He's more of a weapon/plot device than a character. Prove me wrong.</br>  Look, I'm sorry, but you don't introduce a character, try to make him significant to the plot and to the emotional well being of our protagonist, and kill him off all in the same motherfucking episode, and expect me to give a shit, or for that matter be anything but incredulous when Shinji gives a shit. That's not how character development fucking works  <br>I'll fucking cut you.</br>  <br>You know this to be true.</br>  <br> Yer kiddin' </br>    Can't even watch the 2nd season because this annoying bitch is in it.  <br><br>Nigger I'm a Sayakafag and even I know you have shit taste</br></br>  More like wet carboard cutout.  <br>ayylmaoyama was the shittiest character in that show. In before hipsters bawwwww</br>  <br><br>If Homura and Sayaka both disappeared then Madoka might be remotely bearable.</br></br>  <br>Aoyama wasn't good either, but at least she had a personality.</br>  <br>Madoka is a masterpice of the highest kind, bitch, go rewatch it again.</br>  <br>Autism&gt;Personality.</br>    <br>If him and his gay lover weren't in the show it would have had potential to be a really good show.</br>    <br>She would have killed any other show, but for me the MC did the job wonderfully by himself.<br>One of the few MCs that genuinely made me angry to see.<br><br><br>Didn't watch the anime, but she did save the manga though.</br></br></br></br></br>    Megalopolis was the only good thing she had.   ITT post any character someone likes and wait for them to shit themselves   <br>I would prefer that she was the main girl rather than removing her.</br>  <br> he likes shitty characters <br>Not my fault</br></br>  <br>The show was crap from the very beginning though.</br>  <br>Fuck, I'm too late.</br>  Literally every minute she was on screen I felt like stopping the fucking episode and doing something else.  <br>yeah just look at all these butt-hurt five waifufags... oh wait</br>  <br>Sheryl is an old an busted whore who's CDs don't even sell in clearance.</br>  <br>Replace Sayaka with Mami then yes</br>  <br><br>You lost, Rankafag, deal with it.</br></br>  <br>There is literally nothing more to that show that you couldn't see after one watch. It's pretty fucking shallow.</br>  <br>Why did they have to make this slut so cute just to kill her later?</br>  <br>Almost as bad as pic related</br>  <br>Inaho was much worse than Slaine. Boku no Pico man forgot to write characters for both of them but that just made Inaho be perfect for plot convenience and Slaine do random bullshit to further the plot. Watching Slaine was arguably more fun. <br><br>But this is mostly season 2 be glad you didn't watch it.</br></br></br>    <br>She's pretty cute. Whatever show it was, it was probably worth it.</br>    <br>Except thats wrong.<br>You should be posting Aiz or Lili.</br></br>    <br>Inaho bored me but Slaine was simply plain annoying, not fun. There was not anything fun about AZ past the first season. Slaine was terrible because on top of being badly written and inconsistent, he was angsty, ruined everything and was all around unlikable to boot.</br>  <br>Really? That's fucking manipulative.</br>    <br>I wanted to watch the series for this perflat girl.<br>Dropped it when the fat fuck threw the bento on the floor.</br></br>  <br>I don't know, he was fine by me.</br>     No pic related <br>Fuck guys, do I have to do everything around here?</br>  <br>She's hardly the reason S2 was shit.</br>    <br><br>He literally does nothing, he could ruin the show in the same sense a misplaced chair could.</br></br>  You can't pick a protagonist or primary main character that was there from the start and say they ruined the anime. That just means you thought the anime was shit, there's nothing to ruin.  <br>holy fuck lol i know this guy. i went to a neighboring school</br>  <br>No, the question can work for them. It's about characters who ruined the show, period. It refers to whatever actions said character committed etc. Could easily be something they did later on.</br>  <br>Not singlehandedly. The plot got dumber every episode - she was just the worst part of a whole mound of shit.</br>    <br> actually watchign TG </br>  This fucking bitch.    Shit voice.  <br>Fuck you.</br>  <br>Hana Kana shills at it again.</br>  <br>It wasn't even Light becoming sloppy and falling in to his lap, if you rewatch Near's explanation for how he figured out Light's plan and set it up so they wouldn't die, you'll realize the reasons he gives are actually reasons that would make Light's plan work. The author just relied on the audience not actually thinking about it and just saying "Oh so clever!!!"</br>  Yokoi is a shit whore.  <br>You shut your whore mouth.</br>  <br>She was pretty likable in the movies though.</br>  <br>Fuck you nigger, Seki can't prop the show up himself.</br>  The main character.        <br>the problem was that they macguffin'd him in. You spend your entire showdown hyping up L and then finally conclude it only to go 'nope lol theres someone even better'<br>wtf is this shit, i thought we had something with clearcut writing no bullshit</br></br>  He's so boring. Something about the series seemed promising, and I got about 1/4th of the way through it before I just gave up.  <br>Wrong character anon. At least Nardo picked best girl.</br>  Fucking Katz.  I cheered when he died.   This faggot ruined the entire series, not just 1 season and 2 season but every arc he didnt even appeared in. He is a liar and tricks innocent people (even little children) for their money, then when he is a narrator he lies and tells "I did it because im gooood ok?" when with a little longterm thinking, you would realise that would be extremely illogical to pursue said stuff and instead doing it differently acording to what most people would do in said situation thats common fucking sense.<br><br><br>Having a second male in a harem anime is disgusting in its own though.</br></br></br>      <br>Oh speaking off, I cheered when the conman in monogatari died aswell.</br>  <br>this was bad before she appeared<br><br>im ashamed that, of my friends, i was the latest to drop it at ep 9</br></br></br>  <br>thank you</br>  <br>Don't get me wrong, Pinkshit is a horrible character, yes.<br><br>But the one who singlehandedly ruined the anime was Sauce.<br><br>Come on.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You should at least watch the first half of S2. the misaka clones arc is great.</br>   90% bait replies <br><br>This thread is bad.</br></br>    Ruined it with  his lack of screen time.   <br> But the one who singlehandedly ruined the anime was Sauce. <br><br>Pretty much. I can't see how anyone could think differently.</br></br></br>    <br><br><br><br><br>Agreed.</br></br></br></br></br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #4 <br><br>Remember to relax and take it easy.<br><br>Previous thread </br></br></br></br>  <br>Um, well, what do you want me to draw?</br>  <br>My waifu, but I want to repay you for it instead of begging you for it  or you can just draw her next weekend I guess </br>  <br>You don't have to beg or pay or anything like that; just tell me who she is and I can draw her for you.</br>  <br>But I got something this weekend.</br>  <br>Plus  I want to pay you fool take my damn money you did a lot for me already </br>   GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA~   <br>I understand if that were samogon<br>But it's some cheap shitty beer that's probably as strong as Guiness.</br></br>  I'm still waiting to see someone do that in real life. Even in Japan no girls did that. Anime, explain yourself.  <br>I do this all the time in real life after getting off of work</br>  <br>Vocaroo or it didn't happen</br>  The best grill is here f/a/ggots, sad to know she already lost the Tanuki-bowl even if she's leaking tons of fluids all over the place.  <br>Too much magnesium in her diet</br>  It's kinda crazy how she went from purest, to flood maker with just a kiss and a heroic act.  <br> Spent an entire episode implying that she's been dripping wet everywhere she goes <br> She actually walked in, tied up, and almost raped the MC, while she certainly had a fantastic amount of exchanged saliva <br> Walks back, still immensely horny, dripping the entire way home <br> It's been more lewd than the manga, and more graphic than the LN <br> Censoring it at this point <br><br>They aren't holding back at all for this. They're gonna blow their load 100% in order to make sure the lewdfags are satisfied, because they know they aren't getting any puritybux.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  the anime got lewder and now /a/ loves it.  <br>I don't think she would be embarrassed about playing with herself. She'd probably have a bottle next to her so she can collect her "Love Honey".</br>  ITT: Meme anime      i hate this  Yusari~n made my heart go doki doki and hit a home run.  <br>Dissociative identity disorder (DID), previously known as multiple personality disorder (MPD),[1] is a mental disorder on the dissociative spectrum characterized by at least two distinct and relatively enduring identities or dissociated personality states that alternately control a person's behavior, and is accompanied by memory impairment for important information not explained by ordinary forgetfulness. These symptoms are not accounted for by substance abuse, seizures, other medical conditions, nor by imaginative play in children.[2] Diagnosis is often difficult as there is considerable comorbidity with other mental disorders. Malingering should be considered if there is possible financial or forensic gain, as well as factitious disorder if help-seeking behavior is prominent.</br>  <br>I want to see a love triangle where sanic falls for Misa.</br>  <br>MC clearly sees Nao as a woman since he was all flustered with their skinship</br>  <br>I want sanic to have his own harem.</br>  <br>Mary Sue will break, she feels guilty because she indirectly caused imouto to be kidnapped/get killed.<br>She will turn a deredere puppy.<br>I hope the MC just ignore it and stick with Yusa</br></br></br>  W-Well?  <br>Most accurate.</br>  <br><br>Mael is the only friendly girl, I'm sorry you need to have your balls burst to be excited anon but some people want healthy relationships.</br></br>  <br>This. Tomonori is the best girl.</br>  <br><br>Life without spice and excitement might as well be hell. Even boredom can kill witches.</br></br>  <br>Eu &gt; Haruna &gt; Chris &gt; Dai-sensei &gt; Mael &gt; Saras &gt; Sera</br></blockquote>]
