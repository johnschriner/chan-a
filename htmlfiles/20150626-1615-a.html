[  strongest servant   he's really not, he just has an hax NP Herakles was stronger    I'll bite the bait:   Shirou is literally Gilgamesh's antithesis    UBW is a natural counter to GoB   Gil is a Archer class and not meant to fight in hand to hand or melee combat  Thanks OP, I look forward to the next 300+ posts of Fate power level discussion and Servant ranking wank         ....What are you trying to say ? His NP is the only thing he use to fight, and it's them who make him OP as fuck.  I mean if you don't take NP into account, Berseker would have a lot of problem without God hand       Shirou and Archer are counters to Gil. He's able to overpower everyone by the sheer amount of Nobel Phantasms he has, not by the skill of them. Then add on Ea and you got yourself one strong motherfucker.    But he won.     Cool hand Lancer and Deermud aren't strong they just have hax NPs   Lancelot isn't really strong and has hax NP and madness power up   Herakles isn't really stronger he just has hax RM   Do you see where this is going?   I doubt Archer could beat Gil if the fight wasn't in UBW. Hell if Gil gets to use Ea it still is his advantage.           Supposed to be a Chaotic Good   Don't overthink it. Some things just don't have sense in this anime.      Fate isn't DBZ power levels  Fate is "Specific counters, and even more specific counters where anyone can potentially beat anyone, unless something makes it entirely impossible".  Everything is about counters, like Rock, Paper, Scissors.  You might say "Rock is the strongest R/P/S, confirmed. What? Why is it countered by Paper, that's such bullshit, its the best", but that's basically how it works.          He was going to win anyway     he is a king not warrior     What, he intends to lead humanity onto a path of salvation for their sins. How is that not good?    King of Jobbers.    Heroes are their NPs. If you put them all into a drunken brawl, Heracles would probably win, but that's a different thing entirely.    He's entirely about saving humanity, in a chaotic way.  People may bitch about it because they don't like it, but that is the characterization. Everything he does is greater good by his definition, in a warped way.      Heracles, Passionlip, Lu Bu, and Arcuied are all in the same STR bracket.  If you put them all in a bar fight, the ones with the highest stats so far are Lu Bu, Karna, and Enkidu mostly.       global genocide   chaotic good      Ends do not justify a means, considering his path was basically mass-murdering the majority of the planet's population.    Also physically the strongest would be this, stronger than any other servant in general  Full on cheat mode actually      Hence why he is chaotic.    Is it really that hard to understand characters?  He's just being the North Wind, humanity has grown dull so he's giving them a light test to see them overcome this. They won't die from it.      super fucking overpowered Noble Phantasm   another servant has an ability that was obviously made up to counter said Noble Phantasm  Fucking God hand, Raw Anus, UBW, were all too convenient counters for shit like UBW, Gay Bulge, and GoB. Except Saber's luck and pre-cog. That was just broken as fuck. Nasu should have just put a bunch of random skills in a hat and taken some out instead of writing new ones whenever its convenient.        strongest servant   strongest  you meant king of jobbers      Chaotic Neutral is Lucifer in SMT. Gil in Fate UBW is literally Lawful Evil.    king of jobbers   wrecks Herakles    kills Assassin   has the NPs in droves to annihilate Cthulhu that F/Z Caster summoned if he had choosen too   wrecks Saber  Aside from Shirou, which is not a case of jobbing, who did he jobber against?            Gil a shit.     Noble Phantasms are what really decide fights.  The VN uses the analogy (paraphrasing) that one combatant might have a better gun than the other combatant, and having a better firearm would of course give them an advantage in a gunfight. However, mana constraints permitting, the gunfight becomes entirely moot when either side could whip out a nuke. The Noble Phantasm is pretty much a nuke.   That's why Cu Chulainn could win the whole war by himself if he really had the opportunity to, because his Noble Phantasm is so efficient that he can use it seven times in a row without needing to recharge.        People say jobber this or jobber that all day, when it doesn't fit anymore. Only thing he's ever lost to before was an MC.  He's beaten dozens of other servants, won more grail wars than he's lost, and typically comes out ahead. However he has a fatal weakness of losing whenever he fights a plot armored character in the main character spot. Any time its not an MC, he always wins. Even if people don't want to say it, his win record is a sensible silver ribbon at this point.  The only jobbers in F/SN are Heracles and Cu, or maybe they're just Worf's.  They've literally never won an actual fight          I'm a Gilfag but I have to agree that he is like a kid with a strong toy. I still like him though.     he lost cause of pride, had he used EA shiro will be fucked     I'm a retarded cancer      That's why Cu Chulainn could win the whole war by himself if he really had the opportunity to   Most cost effective NP out there is GoB, where Gilgamesh only has to pay the initial cost of summoning the key to open it.  Guess who Cu can't beat  However even the game makes it clear NP isn't everything. It might be a big factor, but skill, stats, abilities, and otherwise play almost as big of a factor each. Like how Hassan's ability at one point neutralized Saber's minor NP.           no rebuttal  You are a cancer, I'll agree.     Seriously those are all pathetic excuses. Not to mention a human Shirou can beat Gil just because he managed to copy Archer's experiences. But his body is of that human Shirou's and they still lack proper training to reach the level of Archer's. Gil lost because of Shirou's plot armor.       Most cost effective NP out there is GoB, where Gilgamesh only has to pay the initial cost of summoning the key to open it.  The difference is that you can defend against GoB, it's just a matter of magnitude. Defending against Gae Bolg is pretty much all down to luck, aside from remaining outside of its range.     There are three methods to overcome Gae Bolg in the game alone    Also another "sort of" method in Ataraxia     he lost cause of pride   Seriously this excuse is just shit. Gil is supposed to have an ability which lets him measure the enemy's power level accurately. He lost to Shirous because of the plot armor, that's all        Who is this? Frankenstein?     Gil is supposed to have an ability which lets him measure the enemy's power level accurately.  citation       Doesn't Nero possess some of the most broken NP's? Surely Nero would demolish Gil's ass?     Ends do not justify a means   Fuck you, nigger.      A being that's rather beyond servants, forced into a servant mold in a way where it has a hard time using its real ability. Yet still remains an absolute monster.

G means gigantism, growing, greed.   It was formerly sealed at the ends of the imaginary number space.   Alter Egos are complexes made from several goddesses, however Protea is created from the essence of the great Mother Goddess that is common throughout all mythologies. Her self can be treated as a Noble Phantasm as she does not possess a Noble Phantasm. As with the Golden White Face, she's a hazard that can only be overcome in battle through the combined strength of several servants.    Class Skills   ■ Huge Scale - EX   A cheat skill that evolved from Self-Modification.   There is no limit to how large she can get. Once the upper limit is reached, the upper limit is further increased. This is infinitely repeated. Basically infinite growth of infinite growth.   Anywho, she's a planet destroying universe level disaster, but giant transformation makes her lose complex intelligence and function. This skill cannot bear common sense, so one completely self-destructs.    ■ Grow Up Grow - EX   Cheat Skill evolving from Experience Point Bonus.   Experience Point Bonus allows one to gain a bonus percentage of experience points after a battle. King Protea's skill cheats and changes it to "Always gaining Experience Points."    Personal Skills   ■ Self-Suggestion - EX   Suggestion applied to oneself.   A skill that raises resistance against mental interference. At A rank "I do not age = Truly stops aging" level of assumption is possible. At EX level, whatever is going on in that mental world is outside of understanding.                                     Machiavellianism a shit.    wasn't wearing any armor   UBW counters and copies NPs faster then GoB can summon them   Gil sucks at close combat  You are dumb.          Actually I read in some Fate thread a while ago. Whether it was indeed true or not the fact is that Gil only lost because of Shirou's plox armor.    Does somebody have the updated version of this?    Nero  B83/W56/H82   Saber  B73/W53/H76 There are so many reason why Saber of Red is better        It's something noted in both the game and interviews. When Gilgamesh looks into Shirou's circuits in UBW route and says he can see everything he can do, when he sees that Archer is a threat to him the first time they meet and decides to do away with him, and here's an interview.   Q: Gilgamesh has no skills in swordsmanship, would Assassin win if Gilgamesh is caught in the range of Tsubame Gaeshi?    A: Most likely, he will just defend with his armour, or take out some really unfair defensive armament that protects against Multidimensional Refraction Phenomenon, from the Gate of Babylon. However, Gilgamesh is capable of accurately assessing his opponents' abilities, so he would not consider having a battle of swordsmanship with Assassin the first place.    We see it in CCC as well, that he has the skill to accurately gauge anyone he sees, as long as he's not so arrogant to not apply himself.  Sees their strengths, sees their weakness, realizes what would be most effective to pull out of his vault per situation.   He took out Archer because he realized he was a threat, but against the human Shirou he just went "pfft".             Nasu really fucked up with the servant shit. Should've tossed out UBW and Fate and instead wrote Ilya and Taiga routes.     &gt;&gt;UBW counters and copies NPs faster then GoB can summon them    Suddenly Shirou becomes a master at his UBW while a proper servant like Gil still sucks at his GOB.  That's why I said Shirou has a plot armor. I know that he has Tohsaka's magic and all so that there will be material to make excuses but it still a shitty way to have Gil lost.      How much agi you need to evading GoB ? B rank ?      Evade it entirely?  EX probably       but it still a shitty way that Gil lost  It was foreshadowed from the start. Shirou copies things and Gil sucks ass at close combat. UBW like mentioned earlier is the literal counter and antithesis to GoB. If Gil used Ea from the start, it wouldn't have been an issue but he was prevented from doing so.  All the other factors mitigated a result of him being defeated. The real bullshit was Archer having that ability to come back to save Rin's ass and push off Gil from bringing Shirou down with him.       Is there any servant that can beat her? The first character that comes to mind is Ado Edem as his Slash Emperor would fuck her up    If Illya wasn't in the way Herc can since he has A agility. So, basing off this servants who at least have A rank agility can.    The other strongest servant    Evade or parry?     &gt;He took out Archer because he realized he was a threat, but against the human Shirou he just went "pfft".  And that was precisely way all of this is pretty stupid. Gil lost because lolpridexD doesn't make sense. Everytime Gil gets fucked up someone starts to spam the shit that he was too conceited. Sure okay, yeah but how he even managed to become a king in the first place, leaving becoming a servant aside if he was this useless? Gil's development doesn't make sense.      she has never seen martial arts    In his own age he was the only hero, the competition wasn't too big, so he wasn't useless.  His only opposition was god beasts, which he did take seriously.  He had his bro Enkidu backing him up at times making up for what he lacked, and after Enkidu died and GIl went on a journey, he was lacking nothing as his pride was shattered.        I like how bold she is    Gilgamesh in F/SN is a shit character that's why. Not only is he not anything like his mythological counterpart he has no real definitive traits besides being the token bad guy.    I understand that you are trying to help me out but man I can't just accept it.  No matter what a supposedly strong and experienced Servant like Gil shouldn't have lost to the MC this way. Servants are supposed to better than this, especially someone like Gil.     So with less NP fired, we don't need much agi ?   Evade. So movement speed and attack speed use different agi calculation ? Or just average between them ?        they are brought into the world with knowledge of the world, she is also a 'master' of tactics and how she should move in a fight. this guy was just adjusting his speed according to her reality marble. surviving a blow that would destroy the heart, i must destroy his brain instead.    Yeah, definitely this is it. Such a big development for him, from the events of Zero!      Gil's development doesn't make sense.   It's noted in CCC that he was warped in F/SN, and was a bit different from his true self. His arrogance was greater than ever before due to his human blood confusing him due to being incarnated.  So yeah, in his own age he was a bit more calm despite still being arrogant. It's like Zero Gilgamesh or Ataraxia GIlgamesh, both of those are far closer than F/SN. CCC GIlgamesh is called his truest self, but Zero isn't really far away either.         they are brought into the world with knowledge of the world  just cause you know kung fu exists dont means you can fight it      hype the power of servants to make them seem unbeatable in Fate   over half the servants were beaten by a human in UBW         he lost cause of pride   Seriously this excuse is just shit.   He lost because PLOT. If Heracles can not STOP or parry al the weapons that Gil sends against him, it is not possible that a human being with a normal body does it.   But even without think about the anime, Gil demonstrates an unerring accuracy that Lancelot or Saber could avoid. It's however absurd that Shirou is able to counter all the weapons that come at him with the same precision and speed. It should be a difference between those who use power for centuries and those who have just learned it.  Shirou win because plot, because is the hero and defeat a more powerful enemy is the symbol of heroism, but certainly is forced and visually requires that Gil becomes more stupid than usual, conveniently missing the target.           Kuzuki isn't an ordinary human, but a killing machine.    Shit post triple accel!   At this moment, you are powerful Not because of any phony god's blessing but because, you are enlightened by your own intelligence.    You'd need rather a few servants working together, no servant alone can fight it. Even Gilgamesh is humbled when he hears its name invoked briefly.   Gilgamesh :: The Ten Royal Crowns — could it be the power of the original goddess…!? Nn…Hakuno, this is bad. If that’s true, then even I will not stand a chance! I scorned her thinking she was at most at level of the Phoenician goddesses — but it seems I was conceited…!   Maybe with a lot of prep time you could figure out something, since they're going to have to fight it in Foxtail. Although its confirmed that BB is stronger than it for sure.        There's a number of beasts out there that no servant alone could probably fight  Like Adam in Apocrypha  The only problem with summoning creatures like that, is that the rest of the competition starts trying to gang up on you.           Doesn't Nero possess some of the most broken NP's?   But how the hell can she be so powerful? Her/His myth does not even have all the shit magic of Arthur.       But how the hell can she be so powerful?   It's because what she represents, the position of the emperor of Rome.  All things converge at the Emperor, just like with Pharaohs.        thank God that someone worded it better than me. I know that there are no plot holes and enough material to make excuses if someone bothers to question it but it still doesn't make it acceptable in any way. I expected more than Gil who was supposed to EUO but he lost like shit because of the MC's PLOT armor which is even stronger than Avalon.      KP is broken strong, but nothing implies she retains the authority part.    Probably scaled to Herc or Lancelot's speed at minimum to dodge/parry/counter.    That's part of why BB is stronger  It looks like she tries to use part of her authority against foxgirl in Foxtail, but Fox shuddered it off with will power of love, so seemingly it isn't as absolute when she's in this form.        Adam is not one of those. Ea can most likely deal with Eden, and he's doubtfully the only one with an answer.    where is this from?   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=uvb<wbr>aM-URygs</wbr>  [ ] STILL THE BEST OP    It's something that require multiple Servants for sure. Gil is just an outlier. It took Chiron, Atolfo, Seig, and Mordred, I believe.    Also she seems to walk on her hair   You'd need an attack that destroys the world around, since anything Adam stands on is Eden, and violence is not permitted in Eden.  Thus all attacks are rendered null as long as his legs are planted.        Ok, I figure this is as good a FSN thread as any to ask some questions I have about powerlevels, specifically EMIYAs  In the first fight between Lancer and EMIYA in the schoolyard as Lancer readies his NP in the VN it says that EMIYA would've died for sure if gae bolg was activated. If that's the case why did EMIYA play around for that long if he risked dying so early in the HGW?  Also, wouldn't EMIYA theoretically be able to instakill Lancer and almost any servant with triple linked crane wing? I realize he doesn't care about winning, but if he did it seems like the most broken ability of any servant, basically a vastly superior version of gae bolg as it doesn't require anything to be used other than a few projections created ahead of time       Crane Wing requires very good conditions to pull off, yet if he can pull it off its unblockable.  He only has one chance with it       300+ posts of Fate power level discussion and Servant ranking wank  Every single time     Is it really so bad?    No, power level thread are fun and that guy can suck our dick.     our dick      http://img2.megabooru.com/images/f4<wbr>/f48bb4e7638e437671715af7c5c4681e</wbr>      strongest servant   If the writer had a little more inventive, with his power Gil may do crazy things, that no other servant could counter. And I'm not even considering Ea. He has a really nice power, Shirou is a lucky dog to be able to imitate it.      I'm sure there are better drawn and higher resolution fanart of Rin as a futa then what you just linked me      Only proper Servants.    Lancelot, even while nerfed by Kariya he is on par with Berserker Heracles in terms of stats.         Needs to focus Illya to beat Heracles   Implied that he needs to use EA to kill Chtulu   Wrecked by Avalon       Deen Movie     Command Spell nerfed Cu was able to handle Gilgamesh for half a day     Anything anti-fortress or above can kill Cthulhu. Gil probably has a decent number of those but Tokiomi is only familiar with Ea.     Herakles  Maybe against Saber. Maybe.  Cu  Absolutely not. All 3 of his deaths were by plot. He didn't job a single time in the entire VN.       strongest servant    A. The command was geared towards scouting the six opposing Servants. There's nothing to imply it would apply to literally every single fight. II. It was a Gil who seemingly abstained from using GGEA or GGENKIDU. 3. We have no idea if Gil was even serious with his swordspam or not, maybe just enjoying a bout with a demi-god.       The command was geared towards scouting the six opposing Servants. There's nothing to imply it would apply to literally every single fight.  "Fight with everyone, then withdraw," I don't see where it said only the six others.      Didn't Lancer decide in his fight with True Assassin that he'd try to kill him? I might be mistaken.    "Fight with [the six opposing Servants], then withdraw," would be the only way of reading that. Unless it's phrased differently in Japanese, "everyone" can only imply to those Kotomine wishes to scout for his perverse pleasure. That, or Cu goes around every night challenging people to random duels and then running away.    He can go for the kill anytime like he does with Saber. It just makes him weaker if he goes against it like any broad command.    Never won a fight     That, or Cu goes around every night challenging people to random duels and then running away.  That might be why he is so pissed at Kirei.      That, or Cu goes around every night challenging people to random duels  That sounds like something he would do.      I didn't read the VN  Gilgamesh was just about to be killed, Ufotable just made it look like he had Shirou at his mercy.      Bazett will never walk into Ahnenerbe and meet Avenger      strongest servant  Exactly. He wasn't serving anyone here though.     Ehm... could someone bring here the implied novel part? I admit to not having read it, but , sitll, it seems an incredible idiocy.    http://lparchive.org/Fatestay-night<wbr>/Update%20232/ Shirou was about to kill him, grail interferes and dispells UBW so it can take Gilgamesh. there was no "out of UBW" scene for Gilgamesh to stand there pointing swords because Shirou never turned off UBW himself. </wbr>     tries to retreat  C RANK AGILITY        Heracles   RM  Literally what?       Shirou inherits the abilities of weapons downgraded by 1   Using A rank weapons are now B   B rank in stats boosting.       Typo, meant for Iskander there.    present Golden armor that has barely a dent after a dozen hits from Excalibur   forget about it the next route     Alingments All Servants have an Alignment (属性), a status showing a clear representation of the mentality of the Servant, differing from the elemental alignment of magi. It is broken down into two parts, a combination of the principles they consider important and their personality. Principles are reflected as Chaotic (混沌／渾沌), Lawful (秩序), and Neutral (中立, called "True"), and their personalities are reflected as Good (善), Evil (悪), and Neutral (中庸). Berserker Servants have also displayed Insane (狂化) as a "principle", and Mad (狂) and Reckless (暴走) as their "personalities." Differences in personality will not result in major discord, but differing principles can make Servants resolving their differences of opinions difficult. While two Servants may have the same personalities as "good", like King Arthur and Gilgamesh, their Lawful and Chaotic principles lead to differing opinions.      Gilgamesh in a rather large nutshell  To start at the conclusion, you don’t qualify as a Servant! I can’t give you a single point! And as a heroic spirit? That doesn’t bear discussion! No matter what records you consult, Gilgamesh was a ruffian that brought suffering to his country and his people. Calling you a king of men would make me laugh. A fool who united heaven and earth, ruling over men without governing his country. A King of Heroes is just that, and not to be called a king of men even by accident. That principle of kingship is simply to reign. You establish yourself as a king, but that state is nothing but a storm with will. First you destroy. And after that you cannot even promise a good harvest. And in that sad state you gather the riches your subjects produce. Greed. Cruelty. And conceit. Those three things raised to their ultimate form and then made into one — that’s what you are.   Serfs raise their crops, kings raise their countries. But you didn’t even raise a country. You did at all nothing but kill and pursue your self-satisfaction. Your nation, your followers, your legend, none of it continues after you. The only thing remaining to you is yourself. Is this contract, too, nothing but an amusement to distract you from your boredom? An adjudicator who enjoys human emotions without understanding them. That is your true nature, Gilgamesh.         Gilgamesh's Alignment  His alignment is Chaotic Good.   A cold-blooded tyrant, and a hero who had sought and enjoyed all manners of treasures and pleasures.   Though capricious and temperamental, he does not (generally) kill someone simply because he is in a foul temper.   When he kills a person, it is either because that someone’s soul is abominable, or because that person has become an enemy of his.    King and sentencer who weighs both good and evil equally.   To him, a life is only “that which will die this moment” or “that which will one day die.”   A being who is recognized by Gilgamesh as “a life that must die this moment” will be slain, even if a sage.    “So in the end it has nothing to do with rules or conditions and just depends on what he feels like that day?!”   This kind of reaction is understandable, but that is what a king is.   Whether astute judgment synonymous to the truth of the universe,   or misrule during a drunken stupor,   if he is the one to implement it, it would become the indisputable adjudication of the king.   Such is the absolute sovereign.    Though some see him as similar to Iskandar in their egocentricity, the greatest difference between the two is that Gilgamesh has no need of vassals.   Gilgamesh is a king who, from start to end, reigns by means of only “himself.” What he loves are “treasures” and “tools,” while a “person” is no more than that which must one day perish.   ……No matter how worthy of love he may acknowledge that to be.                           Not trying to impress his waifu.   "I'll just wear a track suit."        boosts in stats to servant levels   the swords fight as their original masters did   can literally shoot hundreds of swords per second   can summon a nigh impenetrable shield   "can't beat servants except for Gil"          Wearing armor to fight a stupid faker human  Look man, I could wear my kevlar armor and take my fully automatic machine gun to a fist-fight with a toddler but I woudln't. Cause that would be insulting myself.     You could use a nuke to take out an ant colony...    Lancer would wreck Shirou even inside UBW.    I could, yes. But then I'd be the laughing stock of the world. Plus I usually just pee on ant nests and watch them suffer.    So you wouldn't wear your kevlar armor but you would take out your hydrogen pocket bomb?      That's because his body is still human whenever he's not around Saber. He gets killed because his own body gets destroyed gradually by using the techniques of the weapons. Not only that, but his mana is completely and utterly shit. He can't even summon UBW or trace as much as necessary to beat the vast number of Servants. The only Servants which he'd have an actual chance at beating in a 1v1 fight is possibly Gilles. Even against Medea he'd get his shit kicked in.    Well yes. For instance, Rider has a higher max speed than Lancer, while Lancer has the greatest immediate output, so Lancer's singular swipes and stabs with his lance are much faster than what Rider could do.  Agi is just average speed/reflexes/mobility/etc, so it's not really a good way to tell what someone's max speed would be when compared to others with the same rank.      I didn't say I would, I said I could. Just as Gil could use Ea and destroy UBW.    The whole point is that the constant pressure from UBW spam kept Gilgamesh from counter attacking and taking down Shirou. The Golden armor would have allowed him to just tank hits and go for it.  Instead he just suffers until the point he takes out the big gun.  It makes no sense. The author forgot about the armor.        His body becomes super-human when he uses UBW    So he's a Gary Stu?    Is Gilles really that shit tier?    Assuming that the servant he's attacking doesn't have any other way of defending against it, like Heracles. Like you said, very good conditions, like the right opponent.    Sort of. But Shirou being able to beat Gilles in 1v1 doesn't mean jack shit in an actual HGW because low-mid tier Casters like him depend on preperation to overcome anything. Only high-tiers like Medea are capable of direct combat like her ridiculously powerful beamspam.    And then have mutant radioactive ants take over the world? no thanks.     Who in their right mind would try to summon a Caster? Or a Berserker, only Illya gets a loli loving caveman.    According to Gilgamesh, those that survive are truly worthy of being ruled.   We can all agree that UBW was just a complete mess and littered with plot holes that Nasu tried to cover up with stats, random skills, and interviews, right?   Shirou would probably end up aiming for head/neck if he wore armour though. Would be safer to just pull out Ea and nuke everyone but he too proud for that.  Real reason he lost is because he didn't take his opponent seriously. Which is literally his one weakness.      How would it feel to be ruled by Gil? Will I be rewarded for my servitude with a wife who got deflowered by Gil before the wedding night?   I always thought that Pestilence was the strongest servant    We can all agree that F/SN was just a complete mess and littered with plot holes that Nasu tried to cover up with stats, random skills, and interviews, right?  FTFY     Berserker is good if you're incapable of sustaining a strong Servant I'd say. The mana drain from using a Berserker is bound to be less than from an entire encounter with a proper strong Servant with an NP that uses up alot of prana. The Einzbern however summoned Herakles as Berserker because in any other class, he'd just defy them and save Illya. As Berserker he's alot easier to control.    In strange/fake, he rewarded the loli with a eternal youth elixir for just summoning him to a fight where he gets to fight Enkidu.  If he is really pleased with you, he'll give you both some elixir of eternal youth to spend eternity with.  If you please him, he won't touch your woman.  If you don't, he'll just kill you and rape her.  If she's pretty, he'll just rape her until she breaks.        What if I suck his dick to protect my waifu?     Are you pretty enough to be called a trap?   If not, you die.      agreed       Gilgamesh   Chaotic Good  Get the fuck outta here, dude's Chaotic Neutral at best, he does whatever the fuck he wants with zero regard for anybody else.        No, the guy is lying. His body stays the same, the only thing which can directly affect his fighting capabilities are the weapons he projects, since he projects the techniques used along with them. However this leads to self-destruction most of the time since his body can't handle the power wielded by actual Servants, hence why his body turns into swords in HF.    King of Jobbers. Shirou doesn't even need to use UBW since goldie just starts missing when it matters most.      Gilfags will defend his Chaotic Good designation to the end, so don't bother. They basically don't understand that if Gil is "good" because he believes what he's doing is right, such a thing making him "good" means the term has literally no meaning, since it would make everyone good no matter how much evil they did.      Humans are evil. Disposing of evil is good. Therefore Gilgamesh is good.  I mean seriously? The grail is basically a reflection of humanity itself.  You faggots just can't accept that your lazy, selfish, vile kind deserves death.          Humans are evil in his own eyes. Every fucking bad guy in existance have thought that they were right in what they were doing because they viewed their objective as right. Him thinking he does shit right doesn't make it good by default. His method and goal completely contradict that.    Read some of his CCC stuff. He's a observant guardian of the concept of humanity as a whole, pushing them forward in harsh but meaningful ways. On a personal level, he's a total ass, but chaotic good fits his ideology.     roleplaying     So you're just gonna ignore everything I posted. Okay, suit yourself.     Herakles was stronger  Ilya, please, bodies don't talk.     He's good in the sense of old civilization ways.  Marvel Comics Apocalypse goes with the same mentality of survival of the fittest as those who live through struggles are strong.  The humans of the modern era do not struggle in life and death situations as the ancient civilizations did.  There is also so many more humans on the planet that each person's worth in continuing the lineage is divided by 1/7billionth of what it should have been for survival.       No, humans are objectively evil. The Nasuverse is very clear on this.    He's a tsundere. He can't help it if he comes off as a dick.    Pestilence is a weird case because it isn't necessarily "strong" ,you just can't "fight it" because there isn't really something there to fight...Or maybe you can with an anti-bacterial NP.    JETS&gt;Nukes    He was a dick to his own people and didn't do it for the greater good, he did it for his own sake. His entire act was specifically to provide himself with future convenience with proper servants. That's the entire reason he's bothering with "purging" the world in the first place.     Humans are pretty evil...That is why we want to be our own governing body of what is good and bad and not some supernatural conceptual idea of some sky god to dictate what is good and what is evil.  It's better to say those deities or spirits do not exist because they are not real. Like good and evil.     Who is the most heroic of all Servants shown so far?   For ancient kings, they WERE the judges of good and evil.  Otherwise Hammurabi was just a philosopher lawyer.     tfw Gilgamesh is officially chaotic good in contrast to Enkidu who is APPARENTLY true neutral.    To be fair Gil became the way he did specifically so Humanity wouldn't be judged by the gods anymore.  He was a good king in his teenage years until he decided to seperate himself from everything and everyone in order to become the judge      How about JETS with Nukes?    That doesn't make his intentions in question good, even from his own perspective. Convenient yeah, but only the process would be considered good from his own perspective. Everything else would just be a neutral action, the most accurate alignment for him after having gone through the 10 years between Zero and stay night is C/N.   Enkidu is just a divine clump of mud who grew attached to Gilgamesh. The only one who he'd preform actual good acts towards is Gilgamesh, everything else would be a natural and therefor neutral act.      Gil's alignment makes no sense, even his most favorable portrayal in /CCC doesn't portray him as "good", in fact it's pretty explitic that he's aware of being evil and that it's intentional.  Nasu is just a retard and a shit writer.     That is just it, ancient kings are the dictators of good and evil.  You can't compare that now to the conceptual agreement of modern good and evil that we molded into people due to society's progress.  Even then, society's value of good and evil is based upon humans, not gods or deities.  In a cynic's view, humans are judging humans who have the same values as humans. What authority is there? Who is really good?  This human? or That human?        Iskandar.    You just posted him. He died for our sins. Greater than Jesus.  Calm down, big boy, one thing at a time.      From what I understand his tyrrany only extends to you getting caught in his north wind. Like if you happen to have a pretty waifu he will fuck her and force you to watch.  But it's not like he's just being a pointless asshole out of sadism. Which, you know, some kings actually were. Pretty sure he didn't let famines or shit like that happen, and certainly defended his people from monsters/floods.  Basically he's an asshole who's a pretty good king when you get down to it. Unlike Saber who was a moral saint but a terrible king that dragged her country down the shitter.           He's just a pretentious fuck. He would have easily won if he just dispelled UBW with ea as soon as the RM went up, like he did against Iskander. Instead, he fools around because "hurr durr if I take you seriously it's as good as admitting defeat" and gets his arm chopped off. Despite that though, look at this mother fucker. He's missing an arm, his entire torso is split and he's still standing. He may not have true fighting prowess but he is the strongest.    I didn't get ufotables intentions  First they make him look like a badass by just standing there having tanked the hit and basically ready to kill Shirou anyway Then the black hole happens and he almost looks pathetic bitching about his death while in the VN it was more like "OH GOD WHY WON'T YOU DIE" when he came crawling out of the black hole        but   avalon      He doesn't really appear pathetic. He wraps his chain around Shiro and says "I have no intention of dying here." He almost seems irritated when talking about the grail. "Doesn't it know a servant can't be it's core?" Not only that, his statement of "I have no intention of dying here" implies that his wounds were NON FATAL. Seriously, those wounds, non fatal. This dude is insane.    His voice sounded too panicked  Whatever else he said he really meant "please shirou stay there so i won't die"      I don't know whether to admire his determination or detest it considering it was his desire to destory most of humanity that was pushing him forward.     Even against Medea he'd get his shit kicked in   I find that hard to believe when Rin was doing pretty well against her.       Calm down, big boy, one thing at a time.  b-but muh mad enhancement.     That's because she wasn't even taking her seriously at all and didn't think she'd be a threat at close quarters. Shirou specifically uses swords so she wouldn't be dumb enough for that and just start firing lasers. We've already seen how powerful she is in HA, so she's far more than capable of it.    But the reason Rin won was because Medea really played around.    Don't bother arguing with these retards   Shirou BTFO's Gil   hurr it was just a unique counter situation    Shirou BTFO's Berseker   b-but muh blindness    Shirou BTFO's Saber Alter   s-she wasn't really trying, honest    Rin BTFO's Medea (seriously?)   look it was a surprise attack, anyone would lose to THAT    Kotomine BTFO's Assassin   you know, he would have totally lost, he just somehow won because he lacked a heart   Always the same shit. They simply won't admit that humans can easily John Cena servants whenever Nasu wants them to. Heroic Spirits are shit tier.                      His motives were too cliche. Bad guy wants to destroy all of mankind. I was hoping there would be a little complexity to his desires, considering his character. Throughout fate/zero and UBW you see two totally different sides of him. In Zero you see his admirable side in his respect for Iskandar. Even as he brings him down, he says   "Feel free to challenge me as many times as you'd like, king of conquerors. This entire world is my garden and thus I can promise you this: You will never tire of it."  When faced with someone he respects, Gilgamesh is a really cool dude. He's just a dick when someone he looks down on challenges him.        Except all of those are proper explanations. All of those are either through surprise factors or having a very unique scenario in which they have the upper hand. A weaker character or Servant almost always has a way to beat the stronger opponents during specific circumstances, HA even went all-out with this by having Bazett and Avenger repeat the same days until they could beat every Servant through such methods. It's like the Golden Rule of the Nasuverse.    Haha, shut up.    Only in FSN, worse shit set in Fate franchise. Because it tries to make the irrelevant magi waifus and the self insert powerful.  Nasu and other writers learned to not repeat this shit in other Fate works.      That's because Nasu wrote him as a generic asshole villain  Seriously, he's downright psychopathic in F/SN, in the Fate route he goes on about how he wants to feed Saber the grail mud until she looks pregnant or some shit like that.  Then Gen Urobuchi came along and thought to turn him into a better character. Nasu realized the dosh in this and went with it, then Fate/CCC was a giant Gil wankfest too.  They're tried to come up with all kinds of excuses for the difference in personality but at the end of the day its just because Nasu wrote him as an evil fucker originally and they only decided to give him good qualities afterwards.            Only look, the Nasutard defense force is out again.     UBW Anime Gil is also post Fate/Zero, his entire characterization was revised and he's made way more noble.   <br/>   Blame Shinji for that       It's not like you can blame him.     Come to think of it, would Kirei actually want the elimination of humanity? If everyone is dead then wouldn't that mean there's no more misery to jack off to?      Barely made a dent   Hits from Excalibur  Sasuga Gilfags, it was actually at it's limit, and he only tanked Invisible Air.      More like you don't have any arguments. They explain and setup all of those scenarios with proper reasoning, none of these even require the interviews to explain.    Shirou vs Gilgamesh  UBW counters GOB and Gilgamesh is Gilgamesh, thus he underestimated Shirou due to looking down upon him. Shirou going for Gilgamesh directly while UBW protects him from the swordrain is the reason he won, and Gilgamesh has never dealt with such situations and is restricted to the Archer class, so he is garbage in close quarters since he only chucks swords at people and uses his Ea cop-out.   Shirou vs Berserker  He projected Berserkers weapon which let him inherit the technique from it. Nine Lives is a technique specifically designed to kill a Hydra that needed to have all of its heads killed simultaneously to beat.   Shirou vs Saber Alter  Shirou had Archer's arm and thus used the best technique for it. He only needed to get 1 direct hit in because Archer's arm is that powerful in terms of projection.   Rin vs Medea  She sees Rin as a proper Magus, and during her own era a Magus would never practice close combat. Therefor, she saw her as no threat and was just toying around. Rin being better in close combat than the average human is something which she had no reason to expect considering her backstory.   Kotomine vs Assassin  Kotomine is a high-level Executioner and Assassin is a shit-tier Servant who's NP requires Kotomine to have a heart. This makes complete sense.                    muh archer's arm excuse   Archer's arm doesn't make him superhuman you fucking retarded Nasucocksucker. Especially since EMIYA himself would get buttblasted trying to fight Saber in close combat because he doesn't have FUCKING plot armor. Fucking kill yourself.        IA just makes Excalibur sharper. And he tanked hits from Saber's B-rank strength. Unless it has special cutting properties, any good sword is going to be the same in Saber's hands.     Joke works better with just the first page.      block Excalibur   "it was just magic resistance!"   block Assassins katana folded over a thousand times   "it was just a shitty sword!"   He's a literal retard, ignore him.         No IA Excalibur is a 1000 when compared to shit Invisible trash being a 90.    Not that anon, but my problem with the servant thing is that it feels like each servant was designed to counter another, and not actually be a mythological hero that just happened to be summoned in that era with random traits according to his/her myth. Like Lancer only uses Gae Bolg on Saber, and Archer, who can both conveniently counter it, or how UBW itself is way too broken but god hand conveniently counters it just so that Archer would lose to him in Fate. Gil is literally just a suped up UBW with a trump card that ensures he could beat any other servant, and his arrogance is there just so he can die to Shirou. Like, Nasu wrote the story but filled in the blanks with random bullshit like Battle Continuation or Independent Action.       EMIYA himself would beat Saber Alter in a fight during those circumstances. Shirou beat her because the technique is something that nobody else has used, and is exclusive to him due to having the ability to project weapons. It's not 3-hit Tsubame Gaeshi level of unavoidable, but it's definitely up there.    The gold-chargy version is 1000 (like against Deermud). Regular Excalibur is &lt; 80~90.    Still better than HF.    Is it just me or are Ilyafags really obnoxious? Envy over their non-existent route?     Like, Nasu wrote the story but filled in the blanks with random bullshit like Battle Continuation or Independent Action.   That's exactly it, and Nasutards fall for it every time.  He can just come up with a shitty explanation for it after already having written what happens, and people will eat it up because it "makes sense" in their gullible minds.    well YOU SEE, Saber didn't conveniently dodge it like she does EVERYTHING ELSE because Nasu decided she would have a rank downgrade in her Instinct! That totally explains everything!            He lost it in F/Z.    That's because it's meant to be a story. The war is definitely not set to be as random, but it does show exactly how important circumstances and matchups are in the HGW rather than the overall strength of Servants. UBW is never broken, because alot of Servants are able to defend against it and neither EMIYA nor Shirou have enough endurance to be able to tank something like a Bellerophon.  The point of the 5th HGW was never meant to be a standard one to begin with. The 4th was definitely as standard as it could get, barring the ending, but the 5th everyone had different motives as opposed to getting the grail for the sake of making a wish. Everyone is bypassing the rules, which is why it's odd that it's the first HGW work since it's something that would normally be put in a sequel, but that just adds to the mystique.   Gilgamesh arrogance complaints I never understand, since it makes complete sense considering his position and how much of a tyrant he was. I don't think there's any Servant who would bother using Ea right away against a high schooler if they had the powers that Gilgamesh has. The only stupid thing is Gilgamesh not using his armor, but I just attribute that to him looking down on him even more since we've seen him taunting his opponents before the fight, like when taking out Gae Bolg against Lancer.   Battle Contination is in line with Cu's legend, but Independant Action being an Archer thing is weird. I can understand it for Gil and EMIYA though.           Is it just me or are Ilyafags really obnoxious?  Is not just you, they are.      All this time, I was always referring to this for my gag reasonings...how wrong I was...     It's more like REJOICE in the birth of a being.    Which is exactly why I don't understand why everyone likes this Fate so much? I find the others more fun and the characters more likeable but to each his own.     Samefag detected. Still burthurt that no one cares about the shitty Fate spinoffs like F/A?     Yeah all I see from them is constant shitting on UBW, praising HF and saying Prisma fights are better.    Except they do? Anything with the Fate name on it sells great, to the point where even an April Fool's joke got so much attention that it became a proper work.     Against Deermud  That was Invisible Air.     Her NP isn't really broken, it's just stronger in the long run than a more convenient NP due to it's function as a quasi-reality marble. It just weakens the enemy while enabling my waifu to act at her best. Home field advantage - the noble phantasm essentially. Unfortunately, Gil and Heracles would still have a huge advantage.    During their second battle, cuz keeping it invisible is pointless due to Gay Dick.    Actually you're wrong. I'm not  nor is Fate/A even close to being my favorite.     Implying   Japan gave such little fuck about F/A that no one ever bothered to make spoilers for F/A in their LN blogs and F/A ended without anyone caring.   Also, Extra and CCC got outsold by even the Ore no Imouto game so I wouldn't even claim Extra and CCC sold great.        Didn't Extra sell really well in the West? CCC translation when?      to the point where even an April Fool's joke got so much attention that it became a proper work.   You can't really say that when it was years after the April Fool's joke happened.  Also, Narita is such a failure of a writer that he has writer's block with his shitty DRRR series so he is delaying his own series for a shitty April Fool's joke.        And let me guess, you think Nasu is a better writer?    Considering how the pathetic remaining Drrfags all died when S2 came out; yes     Ends do not justify a means  That's what chaotic good is for.     Heracles is the Worf of stay night    Listen, I'm not a big fan of DRRR myself but im pretty sure the disappointment was more of it being a shit adaption than the writing in the LN itself considering the ones who actually read the light novels way back when hung around for so long.    But he was right.  For example, garbage like you would've died.       Archer's arm doesn't make him superhuman  but it does, remember when he runs through the forest at super speed alongside kotomine?     Exactly, and if she used that against that overrated armor it would only take like 2 hits at most.   Best servant , best waifu and  strongest servant .   Undead Sakura    Who is this?    avatar of Amaterasu.    She's the best      Strongest servant     How strong Gil would be if he were summon as saber?  Oh look, CR fixed the chant.   He's not a master but an owner.  His swordsmanship isn't that great.       actually paying for CR    Why is f/sn so shit and why is F/Z so much better?   That's the right opinion to have.  If you're a homosexual.      The origin of life on the planet  Giant Ultra Mummy  We always knew Egypt was hiding some secret.        Well, I am homosexual, what now?     Summon Gil as saber   HURR DURR GOB GOB ALL DAY MONGRELS  Mite be cool      Wait wait wait, Does Shirou not do the chant in English?    It's just understandable. Zero's got a bunch of hot dudes who you could easily imagine pounding your boipussy.    He never did    secondaries start to understand how Shirou's theme (Emiya) works   HF movies   Emiya playing in the background   suddenly everybody knows shit will get real  Fucking Emiya is so goddamn good.       Shirou's chant is Japanese  Archer's is English      I'm just here to point out that someone mentioned  more than 300 reply threads   and we've passed 300 now....       kiritsugu's mix is better than shirou's  which is to be expected     There is nothing to fix,since Shirou's chant is different from Emiya's. I just didn't like that he said it in japanese instead of english :(     watching shounen shit    When did Emiya play in HF? I literally remembered 0 tracks after reading the VN except for Die Lorelei.     nine lives blade works and the kirei fight is all I can remember     Illya's  mix is the best.    I'd that Rin.    Vs Berserker is one instance     Only of proper Servants  Have fun not hitting True Archer.     Timer alter is shit, but it's not the worst emiya    You're running on some really low standards, aren't you, dude?      Oh wait kirei's fight was light and darkness, not emiya    Will they play it for all the 10 seconds that that scene will last?   How much autism shitstorm in powerlevel discussion when 2wei.5 airs?   About as much as every fate thread that ever happens    I just want to know what they'll fill the season with. There isn't exactly a whole lot left.    He's the natural counter to all "Heroes"  Things that are summoned which should not be summoned, and aren't heroes, he does not have their weakness. Another reason CCC tends to test his limits.  Just gotta put down those creatures with pure power if he can. He's the strongest servant because he's the servant killer, because he has their weaknesses.        I'd say that Berserker Enkidu would be stronger.    Beach birthday party  Bazette wank due to fisting blindfold Archer and furry Lancer Gil  Dedicated episode to Gil's shota penis        Timer alter is shit     This chapter gets a whole episode.    Buddha is stronger than Gil  Not even a hero, shouldn't be summoned. Attack power is theoretically able to kill basically anything with humanity.      I'm not Brad Pitt and she's into something I like. Why the fuck not?    Ok it's not shit, but it's still not the best theme    A great deal of things in the Nasuverse that are stronger than Gil can't be summoned. I'm not even sure of Arcueid can be properly summoned outside the Moon Cell. If Karna or Arjuna receives a fame boost from being in India, could they be stronger?    It literally does, did you even read the VN? He jumps out of the Einzbern's castle from like 10 stories up and is barely harmed.    Literally a bunch of shit after the 3rd War are stuff that can't be summoned. Medea and Medusa can't be summoned, neither can you summon something like a Berserker Heracles or Lancelot. Berserker Lancelot was even said to be more of a vengeful spirit rather than heroic spirit.    It's not shit, but it's the worst or second worst Emiya rendition.     Also K&amp;B are beast destroying blades, I believe nasu said at one point that they'd instagib caster's monster     Raw Anus  Also, infinite swordspam. Shirou is OP bullshit.       Wasn't that the actual blades, and not the ones EMIYA has?    Yeah the actual ones, not his projections     wanting 3DPD      I believe nasu said at one point that they'd instagib caster's monster  Yes, if they were true Noble Phantasms mastered by a ledendary hero. But they have no real owner, no hero can be summoned with them as his main NP.      EMIYA won't need to get close whack Caster's monster though. A BP that cause huge explosion or anti monster sword is more than enough.      I'm not even sure of Arcueid can be properly summoned outside the Moon Cell.   She wasn't even summoned in Extra  She just followed Gatou up to the Mooncell, and the Mooncell slapped a servant mold onto her.  She thought it would be fun           Not actually a Servant, but a mysterious creature Gato brought with him from the Earth. A princess who doesn’t seem to be getting any time to shine but has been quite busy, like becoming a cat, or becoming Yuzu-nee, or becoming a silicon lifeform.    In the CCC data book       Didn't read the novels or the materials  Shirou said that he wouldn't be able to defeat a Servant inside UBW, and that Gil was an exception because he is shit. This is later confirmed by UBW entry saying that the ability is only annoying against a regular Servant.     Can a BP do the job, though? Don't you need some A+ Anti-Fortress or stronger NP to kill Ctulhu?     We've had that discussion in almost every thread this week  It's usually the same guy who says "Well Nasu may say that, but it doesn't appear that way to me, so its wrong"  Even when you lay out how UBW is different from GoB and why you can't just say "Well if Gil can do it then...", he still just keeps saying its wrong. Nasu has been nothing but consistent on that one but it can't get through to some people.        That's bullshit though. He has enough stuff there that it should be enough to at least fight Servants. It doesn't make any sense why he couldn't, even with the rank down.    Just Anti-Fortress. I don't think it's been stated how powerful it would have to be.    Hercules lost several lives due to UBW.  Hercules is likely the only servant with that many lives and regeneration.      But why though? Is there an actual explanation for why he can't match them?    Ctulhu needs Gilles alive to maintain its stability, though.  Gilles, likes to show off and if Archer catches sight of Gilles, Hrunting will be able to continue attacking Gilles no matter if Gilles dodges or hides until it has pierced through Gilles.      First, Archer is not Shirou. Their mastery over UBW are miles apart. Second, Archer didn't use the RM against Berserker.      Words from the author   Bullshit  This is as funny as the Gilfags unable to handle the fact that Lancelot was confirmed to be able to defeat him in the materials.       Second, Archer didn't use the RM against Berserker.  There's no proof that he didn't the VN cutt off the fight.     Can only keep it up a few turns, rank downs all around, has to pay heavy mana tolls to keep it up at all, runs out of mana fast, it's a lightning tactic that can only briefly beat AUO in spamming. Against another servant that has mastered one weapon to its apex they will not lose footing against Archer, and will break his spam.  Servants could already break Gilgamesh's far higher concept spam, which is far worse for them since he can spam endlessly, pays no mana cost for spamming, and he can spam their weaknesses. This is the reason Gilgamesh is the worst against other servants; A rank NP shower, attacking them with their specific weaknesses, using their original model against them, etc. Reason Archer beats Gilgamesh is because for a brief few turns that its up he can spam more than GoB, and despite his weapons being far shittier they are made out of the same basic materials, so they'll break against each other since they're only being shot out like rockets. A projection of Caliburn wielded against Saber using Caliburn, it would be shattered in seconds. However a projection of Caliburn shot out against Caliburn that's also shot out with no skill, they'll only explode.  No Archer didn't cast UBW to beat Heracles, he pulled out individual blades or used tactics. UBW cannot be used like GoB, it cannot be all "This is all I have but its enough" or else you're dead in seconds compared to someone who has mastered their blade.  Archer can still beat people by pulling out the right weapons and using tactics, but the rank difference, mana cost, and difference in aptitude means he cannot fight in the same way as Gilgamesh for several reasons.  Despite the abilities seeming the same they are quite different, but only when facing each other do certain things really sync up. Gilgamesh can without a doubt spam better; since its higher quality and he can do it for far longer, yet for a golden few moments when activated UBW can over take it, and only it since Gilgamesh             Gilfags unable to handle the fact that Lancelot was confirmed to be able to defeat him in the materials.   Why are anti fags the biggest wank types in these threads   While he might have been better off if Zouken hadn't punished him by forcing him to summon a Berserker, well… I hate to say it, but the only reason Lancelot was able to fight Gilgamesh as well as he did was due to the parameter boost from being maddened. &gt;And given the single-minded devotion with which Kariya was pursuing Tokiomi, there's no way you could expect him to have the prudence to avoid that powerhouse team and survive to the very end.         Shirou not yet mastered UBW.  Servants like Berserker, Seiba or Lancer would whack him badly in a straight up fight.  Caster might be UBW bait if she goes full retard or careless against boy-ah inside UBW.        The point is that saying UBW itself can't beat servants is like an obvious broken move just not working on someone else for no good reason. If you surround a servant with flying swords that fly faster than Gob (which needs A rank agility to dodge) and you have a shield and apparently move faster than a C rank agility servant, why couldn't Shirou beat a servant? Even if it is a short term thing, no servant except for Lancelot and Lancer have actually survived the sword spam.       Berserker Lancelot was even said to be more of a vengeful spirit rather than heroic spirit  All the more reason for Gawain being superior.     Well anyway, an owner vs a user, a true user of a blade would be up Archer's ass in seconds if all he did was try playing Gilgamesh with UBW.  He has to use his own inferiority as a weapon, and make up for it with skill and planning. He cannot fight like Gilgamesh, he cannot be Gilgamesh. He has his own style that can only work for him.  UBW can kill other servants if used as just a tool, but using it like a spam factory he'd be dead against a lot of them.        You'd have to be a real loser to lose against sword spam  Saber broke through it with minimal effort       superior   couldnt even beat him even with the sun advantage       I hate to say it, but the only reason Lancelot was able to fight Gilgamesh as well as he did was due to the parameter boost from being maddened.  Only under Kariya as Master, which is stated to nerf the Servant, and he is confirmed to do good against Gilgamesh.   Team Berserker was a powerful enemy against all other teams, but Lancer had an advantage due to compatibility. It would be optimal to let Berserker destroy the other teams and reach the finale. He could then be defeated at that point.   Add the fact that Illya is now apparently canon to Nasu and Julian said Lancelot &gt; Gil and EMIYA and you get butthurt Gilfags such as yourself.         There's no point in usig the RM against Berserker.  All projections lose one rank, so the swordspam can't reach the required A-rank to hurt Berserker. Also, the wounds on Berserker are carefully described in the VN, and he has no piercing wounds whatsoever,      Its not broken, it's just effective against that one guy since he's only an owner.  Its far more effective to pull out one weapon at a time and use it to its utmost. He'd run out of mana in seconds using it typically. Lot of servants have broken through spam before, even Gilgamesh's higher ranked spam.      Somebody post the Bazzet one.    There is just so many swords, it would be realistically undodgeable and unparryable, and they fly ridiculously fast. Besides that, Shirou can use the NPs themselves, albeit a lower rank, correct? What prevents him from just tossing a Gay Bulge and bullshitting his way to victory?      no servant except for Lancelot and Lancer have actually survived the sword spam.  Saber and Archer have, the latter was even attacked behind his back. Also, the swordspam alone wasn't enough to kill Heracles, targeting Illya and using Enkidu was required.      Mana. Plus servants, barring Gil aren't that pants on head retarded when dealing with the likes of him.      UBW can kill other servants if used as just a tool, but using it like a spam factory he'd be dead against a lot of them.  This guy gets it.     User &gt; Owner  You cannot hope to match Arthur using a copied version of Cu's abilities or tactics. Arthur wouldn't lose against Cu normally, she sure wouldn't lose to a shitty version of him.  This is the reason he's effective against Gilgamesh in particular.  You can't fight Cu using a shitty version of Arthur's fighting style or abilities, you can't fight EMIYA with a shit version of Arthur's abilities, he'd push you away in seconds. EMIYA had to develop his own style if he wanted to stand on head with these monsters, because a projected version of someone elses style, tactics, or abilities just typically would not work unless it was in particularly very effective against one guy.  Lets say that another servant could fight Cu on par, or even beat him. Maybe even if they were just a rank below him. They would not lose to a half assed version of his abilities even if they would lose to true Cu.  Also a lance is not a sword               What prevents him from just tossing a Gay Bulge and bullshitting his way to victory?  The fact that he can't use the reverse causality version and that Caladbolg II has a bigger boom, which makes using the thrown version pointless.        &gt;And given the single-minded devotion with which Kariya was pursuing Tokiomi, there's no way you could expect him to have the prudence to avoid that powerhouse team and survive to the very end.  We already saw how it ended for Kariya when the idiot went after Tokiomi. If Lancelot loses his prana supply because of the idiot imprudence, he is not going to survive to the very end even if he defeated Gilgamesh.     It was smart to go after Gilgamesh first, the only chance you'll have against the strongest guy is when you're also still at your strongest. You won't stand much of a chance when you're already worn down from the others. If he can't beat him when he goes for him first, then he just can't beat him.     self proclaimed strongest servant   He is camping sword spammer Faggot that you always meet in XboX online, he should be banned for cheating       Also a lance is not a sword  Not this again.  Any bladed weapon can be replicated with no problems and other stuff like shields, armor, fishing rods or even towels can be projected with some extra cost and effort.      I'm talking about how the idiot went after Tokiomi by himself and got wrecked. He should just avoid Tokiomi and let Lancelot kill Gilgamesh as he is said to be able in the Lancer entry, not face Tokiomi directly in a Mage duel. If it wasn't for Kirei the retard would most likely have died right there.    He only can in the Lancer entry if Lancer disables him first.     That Saber        let Lancelot kill Gilgamesh  topkek      Gilgamesh strength comes from his NPs, not from himself  And the fact that Lancelot is also disabled makes things worse.     Reminder this is canon.     He doesn't know about Lancer entry      Gawain   1st seated knight in Erec &amp; Enide   Fights Sir Cliges who kicks Lancelot's ass to a draw &amp; only because Arthur decided to call it a tie   Was in the Welsh tales as Gwalchmei, who is also Arthur's best Rider &amp; said to always return from a quest successfully    Lancelot   3rd seated knight in Erec &amp; Enide   Appears only to get his ass kicked in Cliges by Sir Cliges   Not even originally one of Arthur's knights, an OC by Chrétien de Troyes             Reminder that's not F/Z Lancelot    Lancelot isn't disabled, it's noted Kariya had exceptional compatibility and usage for a half baked magus, but its noted he needs Diarmund to do his thing to stand a chance. People love to underrate Kariya to wank Lancelot harder, but its noted Kariya despite not being Rin tier at all was very good for someone who's never practiced. He was born as someone with mid tier potential anyway.  That way next time Gilgamesh reaches for his key, his left arm is disabled so he ends up dropping it on the ground, and panics. Either that or having a wound that can't heal would fuck him up somehow.  He needs Diarmund to win there, its noted Lancelot on his own would lose surely if Gilgamesh got any more serious.        Gawain is a tank, Lancelot is a fighter jet.  Gawain's power under the Sun is unmatched as stated, but Lancelot's speed and evasiveness allows him to survive until an hour or two passes, as he's the most skilled knight.  Gawain only gets solar buff for three hours during the day in particular.       Why is Excalibur blast considered strong?  It's just a energy blast.  It's not broken reality warping shit like Gae Bolg.       Good. Now we have an excuse to argue about Arjuna vs. Karna powerlevels.   That's very cute art by the way.      Reminder that Lancelot stuck this jobber down and later died from Lancelot's final blow.    It get shit done with blast. Gay bulge melee needs to be in certain range to Gay Bulge reality warping     its the last phantasm, the stupid bullshit thing that encompasses the will of all warriors throughout time and space as their combined wills form the spirit bomb.  Despite how she NEVER fought for all warriors, she only fought for her small kingdom of sheep fuckers.  Also she has the lance that encompasses the concept of the age of dominion of man, in that if its ever broken the age of man will be over.  ALso the super ultra super super special ultra fairy realm phantasm that's better than anything that puts the user in another dimension  Arthur isn't strong in particular, she was just given top tier bullshit items by faeries, and still managed to lose to a normal human army. A number of her knights seem to be better. Her power is being blessed by things.             Isn’t it obvious? Kariya, you should know that as a magus, your abilities are not just one or two notches below the other Masters. It will affect the basic abilities of the Servant.   Exceptional for shit still means you are shit   Strong opponent now somehow needs everyone to be gimped while he isn't in order to win   but its noted he needs Diarmund to do his thing to stand a chance  Diarmuid thing is also on him, unless you think they are best buddies until the the last battle, which is never even implied in the first place. The word hostiles is clear.   its noted Lancelot on his own would lose surely if Gilgamesh got any more serious.   Iskander survived 80  How nice is to use some quotes that are proven wrong volumes later.            Also since birth she was scouted by a wizard gremlin that can see all things.  Was loved by everyone, including the people that hated her.       Lancelot is a fighter jet  I'M CUMMING. Finally some one admits it.      Not that guy, but you are in serious denial, bro.     Denial   Quotes from the materials and the novel  He is actually right.      It's a long range, wide-area, massive magical nuke. It's strong enough in terms of raw firepower to outright kill servants in 1 shot, or destroy their noble phantasms entirely and hits a large area from a distance. When she's attached to a competent master, it's spammable.  No other servant matches its firepower except for Ea, and it's strong enough to negate most of the power of an Ea blast. In Fate she destroys rider and rider's ex-ranked mythical beast NP in 1 shot of a partially charged excaliblast.  It's strong        I really wish this wasn't true.     In Fate she destroys rider and rider's ex-ranked mythical beast NP in 1 shot of a partially charged excaliblast.   Beast was B plus rank      You can start the death of humanity with killing yourself.     Implying that what was written actually happened   Implying that the Battle of Camlann didn't happen in the Welsh legends before Lancelot was made   Implying that Lancelot wasn't written in after the tale was done       Alexander shouldn't have his reality marble, either.  His army fucking hated the shit out of either.  A shit ton of racial tensions and backstabbing went on behind Alexander's back.  Some of Alexander's generals lost their lives from assassination or pure jealously and greed.   There were more professional, less scummy and less backstabbing armies in history that should belong in an army NP rather than Alexander's army.              A+   Still weaker than Excalibur by fifty or a hundred points.  Its the reason Rho Aias could make up the difference, but it was nowhere near EX.        Fucking underage.    Gilgamesh is mostly divine, and divine spirits are something above humanity, created by humans, to punish humans.  He's quite literally more than human, and is in a position to judge. It's not just "Well you can't judge me, you're a faggot, I mean you're human as well".     The Lancelot armor is one of the shittiest things I've seen.  Looks like something I'd draw when I was a 13 year old chuuni, can't believe a professional artist/character designer came up with that shit tier design.     That's a terrible analogy considering a nuke is slower than ballistics from a handgun and will kill both combatants.    He isn't. He does have a lot of powerful toys, yes, but all he does is fucking stand in one spot all day long while still being surprised that others can get close to him.  The only exception to this is his moving platform, but that advantage was easily taken away by a 90s fighter jet.      It's canon in fate that Lancelot defeated Gawain and he later died from Lancelot's final blow.     13 year old chuuni  Sounds like Urobutcher's edge fetish.     It not much worse than this. Lancelot's Armor design is rather tamed than later armor designs.    I meant the anon, though.    90's fighter jet made into a NP and with features it shouldn't actually have.     Was loved by everyone, including the people that hated her.  Thanks GoA      That's why Cu Chulainn could win the whole war by himself  Berserker and Gil say hi.     GO Saber's design is really great    Isn't Cu said to have a chance against Heracles? And Gil needed 12 hours to deal with a Cu that was held back by Kirei.    There will never be well designed armours for Saber's. Never ever.    Lancer wasn't held back against Gil and he has a not hopeless chance against Berserker.    Yes, he has a very slim chance of doing it, but it's possible for Cu to beat Herc.    A chance is just a chance. If he'd win one time out of a thousand, he still has a chance. Best thing would be for everyone to take their turns with Berserker, die to him, then let Lancer kill him with a RUNES enhanced Gae Bolg.     Dat shit taste    EX  EA   Amita Amitabha   Avalon   Demon King of the Sixth Heaven   Enki   Excalibur Proto   Golden Demon-plane Zipang   Hanging Gardens of Babylon   Ionioi Hetairoi   La Pucelle   Nursery Rhyme   Saraswati Meltout   Sword Hunt   Three Thousand Worlds   CCC(?)

I thought the Command was clear.     Anon a shit     Lancer wasn't held back against Gil  Yes he was, Kirei's command spell forces him to hold back and not kill servants on their first fight.     There is no prototype for Excalibur.     Implying that Gawain also didn't fight Galahad some time before &amp; held on the longest   Implying that it isn't canon that Gawain &amp; Lancelot are equals    Implying that Gawain doesn't count        He wasn't command spelled to not fight Gilgamesh.      General command spells don't have enough power to last long. Rin's command spell to make Archer follow her order only worked because she's impressive. Kotomine is a shit compared to her.    Look at his left leg. That ruins it.    Command spell saved his ass for twelve hours there.  Command spell forced him to always survive the fight battle and escape, do not try to finish it.       Isn't Cu said to have a chance against Heracles?  He has chances as in "it's not 100% impossible to win", but his odds are terrible. Enhancing Gae Bolg 12 times with RUNES and delivering those 12 kills against an oponent with way better stats (especially luck) and better master support is a herculean task. I can see him pulling a heroic double-KO with some command spell support, but not much more.      Ah, sorry about that. Forgot about it.   Sup faggot   I killed that fucker in Extra.    Also his arms, but at least he looks nice.      The fuck is that?   Didn't Gawain beat Gil in CCC?   King Richard the Lionheart.  A.K.A Thug life saber.     You don't have to fight him, and that's a very weakened Gilgamesh. Pretty sure it's also during the three hours.    Lancelot was here Gawain a shit     Because you had the Vorpal Blade  The one thing that could ever kill it, made from Malachite.      Where's he from? Wiki gives nothing.    If you borrow money from Leo to buy a school uniform for Sakura, because you're all "Hey, she's a part of our group as well, I'll pay our of pocket to treat her human. Since I also have some reservations about being treated human, also Rani". Sakura is like "Well, its not like I need it, I mean It doesn't really change my productivitiy", but fuck that, it's a symbol of the team. They were all wearing matching jackets, she needed one as well. Treating her human earns super points for the final ending.  He later sends Gawain to "collect your debt".      summon Assassin to use for stealth   instead of ego wanking like all the other Masters, never interact with anybody, never reveal yourself   kill all the other Masters with stealth, traps, sniping, poison   auto-win HGW because nobody else knows who you are and you never fight head-on, only laying traps and killing people with stealth from long distance   Why doesn't anybody do this        Fate/Strange fake.  He hasn't done too much though yet aside from being arrested.     but that's exactly what kiritsugu did    Male Hakuno under his character entry is really geared for CCC; his most hated thing is debt collectors, hates warmed goods, worst enemy is the final boss of CCC, etc.  Female is apparently geared for original Extra; worst enemy is the final boss there, hates weapon bragging, hates hard beds.      4th Assassin, is a tool to be used for spying.  5th Fake Assassin, is a gate guard  5th True Assassin, is actually really competent, but Zouken a shit. Also Kotomine "lol no heart" Kirei        Because it would work  Julius basically tried to do this, and despite killing a few dozen masters, his own servant got bored and handicapped his own main ability so he could finally taste a battle where someone didn't die in one touch for once.       equal    but shortly defeated by Sir Lancelot's superior swordsmanship which rivals King Arthuria     So what's the general gameplay of CCC. Is it still mostly arena grinding?     Berserker is Cu's hardcounter and the one servant that he'd be hard-pressed to beat.    Fuck. He's the guy who revealed his sword to the public, isn't he? Dude is fucking based.    Apparently less grinding but still rock paper scissors   Still waiting for new info on grand order.   Some things changed, a lot of the core pieces are the same  Animations no longer repeat in as lazy of a way, healing fountains on floors in easy mode, much more story involvement to the point that the amount of text is almost as much as F/SN, retain levels for your servant on NG plus, can skip cut scenes on new game plus, a bit more involved or shaken up in general.  However the battle system was not made as it was by mistake, so obviously it mostly kept to its core.  Way more character involvement all around, way more of everyone.          Kinda hasty with the file-naming there, aren't you?     Sir Lancelot's superior swordsmanship which rivals King Arthuria  Isn't Lancelot skill confirmed to be many times greater than Arturia?     canceled     However the battle system was not made as it was by mistake  It sure feels like it. Couldn't they have put more effort in that literally rock paper scissors?      I don't mind the RPS combat, it was just the constant arena stuff that I hated in Extra      Greatest of his era  Pretty much.      Widely considered to be equal of King Arthur by many and the wielder of the lesser-known holy sword Galatine, Sir Gawain was fiercely loyal to the king, or more accurately, the King's station. Unlike Sir Bedivere, a trusted friend of Arthur's who wished only that he would find peace and contentment, Gawain's only concern was that Arthur maintain the throne of Britain.    If King Arthur was seen as the personification of the moon, then Sir Gawain was the harbinger of the sun. He was frequently compared with Arthur, although Gawain himself ignored these comparisons and devoted himself to serving his king to the best of his abilities. Though loyal to the end, his irrational hatred of Sir Lancelot proved to be his and Arthur's undoing.   It's Gawain that was King Arthur's equal in Fate  Lancelot has the skill that says he's the most skill of his era. Not the strongest, but the most skilled at least.   Gawain's ability matched Arthur, and GoA tells the tale of the time only Gawain and Arthur survived fighting a dragon, while the other knights and elites laid bare.            Not many times greater, but yes his skill was confirmed to be a master among the lands he was in.    It doesn't even matter. Lets say it comes out or more gets announced for it soon after UBW ends or HF ends Then what, you have to wait fucking 10 years for a translation? It's too much Time to learn moon. I can't trust these fucking weebs to translate anything reliably.  I've been waiting for more info for Tsukihime 2 for fucking ever now but I know when it comes out, I'm going to be waiting year after year after painful year with no translation Suicide is the only option          Well, who else would it be? And, plus she was originally going to be in the VN, but Nasu later discarded her due to the fact Archer has Rho Aias.    During Zero it was said his battle prowess was many times greater than hers.    What? Mordred killed Gawain in Garden of Avalon.   Why didn't Lancelot just keep his dick in his pants?   Fate/exta stated Gawian died from Lancelot's wound.    Saying its literally Rock, Paper, Scissors is like saying "C'mon, Cu's design is so shit and lazy, its literally a dog".  Kind of oversimplifying it to fit into an insult mold. It's been explained how the ins and outs of combat worked here more than a few times. Pattern recognition is key, prediction opponents attacks based on what they have, use items or SKILL to overturn situations where you would have no chance.  People were expecting an RPG where they didn't have to put in thought, another final fantasy where you press A to attack. This one requires a bit more thought, to the point that people who are bad at it tend to feel its literally nothing but random, no matter how its explained that there is no real element of chance if you're doing it right.  Skills, Items, and patterns; R/P/S is only an intimitation or guessing game, but this game gives you everything you need to figure out exactly what the opponent will do, or make up for the difference even if you're stuck. However it forces you to think hard since you're only permitted one extra action per turn. You'd really have to suck at recognizing the opponents style if you're dying here.            As a swordsman, Arturia is better than Lancelot or a bit better. Lancelot was in awe at Arthur when they met in Garden of Avalon. But Lancelot is more versatile and can master every weapon while Arturia only uses swords and spears.  But as a swordsman Arturia's better. Arturia was better at everything in the Round Table. Even the guy who was sent to be Morgan's assassin admired her and said none of them could compare to her.         she was originally going to be in the VN  Yes  Nasu later discarded her  Yes  due to the fact Archer has Rho Aias.  straight out of your ass         Lancelot can kill dragon's as well due to the fact he has a blade that can pretty much kill them.    He was wounded when he fought Mordred. But Mordred killed him. Written by Nasu.    It just does extra damage to them because of a legend where Lancelot slayed a dragon.     Lancelot more skilled   draw Arondight, strong against people with Dragon Affinity like Saber   loses one-on-one to Saber with no bullshit      Post smug anime.

I don't think he'll turn evil, but he'll either get killed by Stain or get almost killed by him before being rescued in his own "origin story" chapter.    It's why I can't wait for a more serious change to his costume as he makes his own hero identity separate from All Might's legacy.       Probably, the poor guy can't land a hit    We get to see Kachan and Ochako this chapter. Kachan is with a hero called Best Genist and Ochako is with Gun Head.   Holy shit its the zoo manga.      To be fair, old school professional wrestlers and body builders were like that when they were 12. There's a reason they're the elite.      It's wonderful that Horikoshi gets to do these kinds of things. Now here's to hoping that Shiina can also make an appearance as a hero.    Sublte as hell    Is she the hero that got Ochako?    Didn't even change the name.    Pretty sure Ochako went to that martial arts hero.    Are you a speed reader?   Alright, theory time. Best genist is the main villain of the series, who talks to Tomura through the monitor. He's going to learn about Deku having OFA from an offhand comment from Bakugou about Deku being formerly quirkless. You heard it here first.     No, Ochako is with hardcore fighting hero GUN HEAD. We see them this chapter.    Not bad, It´s make sense    Nope. If I read the spoiler right she's teaching to Kendou and Momo    So, Sensei no Bulge characters when?   I NEED IT.   arnie at 16. it's totally possible to be as ripped as baku and more    We need Tiamat in this series.    Flexing 5% in one arm made his grab too fast to see and was enough to flinch Todo with wind pressure. Not to mention it intimidated him into lighting up.   Deku will probably run OFA at 2% all over, all the time. That should at the very least boost all his physical attributes by a tremendous amount.       Forgot about gun head.   Thanks         13- Ultra Battle Satellite (END)  ahahaahhhahaahahahhaahahaa    There's another spoiler in which deku has like lightning on his body but i forgot where   Reddit link in this thread   Whole body confirmed   This could be dangerous     ofa powered dick  Female criminals wont be able to do anything now.     Holy shit just thought about it    Oh shit, He's going to fully power his whole body all the time? That's gonna take some major asshole training.   It look like it hurts a lot.    Straighten Up! Welcome to Shika High's Competitive Dance Club (Center Color)   This is good I like this      Deku's pain tolerance is bananas.  This training arc is going to turn him into the Hulk.     Tell me he gains mass. TELL me he buffs out like All Might.    So anon was right when he said that deku has been using it in only one part of his body and now will use it evenly across the whole thing.     DekuZyzz     That won't be till 2nd or 3rd year m8   Best Jeanist teaching Bakugo just makes me suspect he's the bad guy even more. He's probably going to try to invite him to the darkside.  So part of thr reason he keeps self destructing when he uses it is becsuse he's trying to cram all the power into one limb for a short burst?   No? It's because his body can't take 100% power. If he used 100% across his whole body right now he'd be a lump of crushed bones.    No World Trigger this week?    It's there. Look again    Does this mean Boruto really doesn't get ranked and we were 5th last week?     Issue #31 (29th June)   Absent in Issue #24  There is 7 weeks between release and ranking.     Anyone see the chapter 47 sketch? They ruined best girl with Froppy.   Miniseries usually aren't ranked. A lot of people thought it might've been ranked though, because it suddenly rose up to second place. While it had always been in the middle before. In the end we'll never know unless shueisha gives an official statement.    Gymnasts look like that. I'd assume other young atheletes could too.    Yeah basically that's why he couldnt control it. I guess it's kinda like how if you were to shoot a bazooka with one arm and leg you would get a major recoil oppose to using ones whole body to shoot it(if that makes sense) or actually it's more then likely what you said he's just putting to much power in one spot.    Actually her and ochako are still cute if not cuter (definitely ochako)    I know you, deeply inside, too know all girls (even background girls) are best girl in this manga.    tfw this is R-18 on Pixiv, and it's just the regular Midnight.    Maybe the camel toe?    We are not getting Midnight without a redesign for the anime if it happen.    Nah, it's kid friendly and magi got away with THIS.     Wait, Tsuyu's frog feet really are just weird shoes?    It could surprise us like Magi that shit kept the nipples on the women with the nipples piercings.    Pixiv doesn't have a very good grasp of what R-18 means.    Because it's blue? The same with the slime in MonsterMusume?    The only problematic part in japan in showing the nipples anyway.   WT is out.  BnHA is next     And?     5 minutes.    Better start calling TL anon.    We'll summon him in due time, don't worry     implying kyoka isn't best girl     kyouka and uraraka are best girls. Tsuyu is shit     Uraraka teaching her classmate how she makes money after school     that's fucking frightening    Probably by ripping then off.      I know that Deku is a masochist but God damn.     no.4  nani?!     inb4 he's the villain alliance leader     Give me your lunch money if you want to live.     It never said he was number 3.    I prefer high rise trousers but this is ridiculous.    ...Wait, just to doublecheck, the black hole rescue hero Thirteen's name is literally Thirteen, and that's not his ranking as a hero, is it?    You're right. I wonder who no.3 is.   If I'm reading it correctly, Ishuhui said they won't be releasing scans today but tomorrow instead.  Can any chinafags give me a decent translation of this?  【抵制熬夜公告】今晚就不做英雄学院了。明天傍晚发吧。这次绝对不会真的不<wbr>会半夜偷偷更新了，人都累了都去睡了。送上一个4号英雄图。大家好梦。</wbr>       my guess is he got usurped sometime after he was introduced at the start of the manga    Welp. The wait is over. Go to sleep guys.     Dang it. release in 8 hours then?     Is he..... wearing a belt on his face?..... i know horiokoshi likes crazy desings but.... wat    Is this true or not?    I thought All Might was known as the Symbol of Peace because he's the biggest superhero and Firebeard was "the #2 Hero" because he was the most impressive and driven in comparison after the almighty All Might.  Are you telling me there's an actual ranking system? Getting kinda tired of that being a thing with Japanese comicbook-style superheroes.      Maybe it´s just a top ten/twenty, I dont think that all heroes will be ranked    Well yeah, but I'm pretty sure it's a popularity ranking     Same birthday    Similar quirks    Similar outfits    Intership under the same hero (seems so)   LONG LOST TWINS IM CALLING IT        GOOGLE TL: [Announcement] resist staying up late tonight, do not do a heroic college. Send it tomorrow evening. The night never really will not secretly updated, the people are tired went to bed. Brought the number one hero in Figure 4. Everyone dreams.     Long lost twins  You mean forced gay romance innit?     This joke will never end, right?     They going to be lovers at the end of the series.  Calling it.        porquesnolosdos.jpg         Funny, Anyone got the 66 dubs.        He is The Straight Shota!   so deku's bones have been breaking with 100% because it's only concentrated in his fist?  So full-body OFA will let him use 100% punches?     He was only using his arm muscles for the punches like a complete idiot, instead of making use of his entire body like any trained fighter would.       These are really high image quality. Where did you get them?       Which is totally going to fix the issue of the backlash caused by his bones being too weak to support his full force.    Maybe the other one had meningitis when he was younger    No, seems hes still using only 5%. What surprises me is how he was able to make a crater on Torino's ceiling with just 5%, considering he hit todoroki in the stomach with the same amount.    no he did that so he only sacrifices small parts of his body. 100% is still way too much for his body to handle. But then when he unlocked 5% he didn't think to change his fighting style accordingly. Mainly because he's trying to imitate All Might's fighting style too much.    And last boss in Garo anime    Deku can only manage 5% of OFA right now.  Up until now he's been concentrating the 5% he had in his arm / leg / fingers, but now it's seem he's trying to dilute the 5% into his whole body.       Yeah. Aren't most scanned images really grainy?      LONG LOST TWINS IM CALLING IT   If anything they seem like a good hero duo      Im the anon that posted the kirishima-tetsutsu pic and I found it on MH. I dont know about the other two.    I was leaning more towards Kacchan - Kirishima as a good duo hero but with all these Kirishima - Tetsutetsu similarities maybe this will be a very good one.    Haha the joke is suppose to be that tetsu himself is the embodiment of being a copy,hints his name repeats it copies it self    Oh god I can see the horror now if toei got their hands on this manga, they would spend 3 minute of deku yelling and powering himself up like this as if he was going super saiyan.    So wait is this a character from hori old series? Because I know it had to do with animals transformation but I never read the series    FORESHADOWING    Yeah it is. She's pretty hot.    We wont be doing hero academia tonight. It will be posted tomorrow evening. This time round we absolutely will not secretly update it again, everyone is tired and asleep. Here's a picture of hero number 4. Sweet dreams everyone.    Right. She's Uwabami from Oumagadoki Doubutsuen.    Read it, it's pretty good and short. The translation was finished roughly a week ago    Yeah.    You're damn right.    No, we can't tell just by looking, we will only know when we see her actual feet.    She's been drawn with normal school footwear. I doubt she could feet her feet in those if they were like a real frogs.    It's probably just an enlarge feet, just like her hands.    Yea her quirk is a transformation not a mutation like Fumikage or Mina, so she's not a frog 100% of the time    Wut?    You mean to say that she is, a frog 100% of the time yes?    Well, I mean, after his profiles listed his likes as manly things and meat, Kirishima is basically canon gay.     webm   Tsuyu a cute.      Not really.    Simply put, she can turn her frog mode on and off    Ill believe it when i actually see it in the manga.    Yes she is, it's a mutation quirk called 蛙, which means "frog"    I dont think likes and what he considers manly are reasons enough to point out his sexuality. If anything, and I might be going "standard" here, these two things mean he likes women.  Don't get me wrong, I wouldnt have any problem with any of the characters being gay etc. as sexuality =/= character, but I think the default in most shounen manga, until proven false, is straight.     Where is Chinabro?   Chinese scans come out tomorrow, so no translation from translatorfag tonight.    Like that perma super saiyan thing Goku/Gohan did in the Cell saga?    If that's the case the frog feet are probably just part of the costume     default in most shounen manga, until proven false, is straight.   Basically true. I was kidding from the start, but come on, saying "I like manly things and I like meat," in English sounds homo as fuck. I had forgotten that mentioning anything even remotely homoerotic in BnHA threads makes things spiral quickly.      Id love it if Horishiko just mentions offhandedly once that someone in the cast is gay and its never mentioned again and everyone acts like everything is perfectly normal.   Imagine if deku or Frog was revealed as such.       Yaoi hands looking a cute in her costume.   He uses 100% because he can't control how much of the power he uses. Just the duration and location. So when he threw that ball or the fight with fire and ice guy he concetrated his power in his fingers that's why he keeps breaking his bones and shit. The 5% you got is from all might telling him all he could safely handle is 5% but deku can't control the percentage of power he uses all the time. Right?    I know, but you gave me the chance to share my opinion in the end.  And I'm fine anything homoerotic here. I have basically only one straight pairing I like (two others I dont really find appealing to ship yet but they are fine)  and the rest are bl .   I think most people wouldnt mind and continue reading as normal. I feel this series is refreshing and good, even though it has its cliche moments, but the characters are all likeable by most of us so I think very few will have a negative opinion.   I doubt deku bc hori will go for uraraka with him but tsuyu would be interesting             Class B costumes  I was waiting for this. More class B please.     And All Might as a teenager.   oh damn he was quite buff back then, in normal form that is.    My dick can not be more erect now    Here's a better look at Tetsu's    ripped as fuck      Cant you like, post the whole chapter or is this all you can find?      What was her quirk?    This is all there is, unless you want a few uninteresting panels of Uravity and Creaty.     Cute   So he was physically build and tall from a younger age. Izuku becoming like him later on, as years pass, is becoming less of an option.   ITS HAPPENING           From what we've seen she can make her hands really big.     not this costume  you had one job Horikoshi     That looks terrible. What color is Tetsu's hair anyway? I would guess blue or white.    She can make bodyparts grow  Specially dicks      So neito will copy her quirck and fuck her with his giant dick   Wait even if there aren't chinese scans shouldn't FA be releasing soon?   too bad he can only keep that up for 5 minutes at a time.     Implying anyone could even last that long with this semen demon     Those are stilettos with fingers.    Show Uravity.    Yes, give me those panels please    they only release that early if someone else beats em to it    Does that mean Kacchan also appears in this chapter or no spoiler panels of him yet?    higher res    Everyone loves Uravity.     CRAP     google translate ftw    It's "grap" with capital G looking like C. Stop fidgeting my autism.    I want to see her interact with Bakugou someday.     What's up, bro!?     Her quirk is creating boners right?      It doesnt look so bad, but it suits the original owner better    Her quirk is making dicks grow right?   <br/>   Well hello. I am definitely gonna try and draw her some.    Twins would be interesting, but I would like to see them as a Hero Pair.    I get the feeling that redriot is gay  He seems to be in awe of men he finds manly   then he gets hard shitty ass joke oh man          The fuck did you smoke, red riot is hairforbrains's model, not the guy whos mentoring them.    All Might doesn't have a "normal form", not until he get injured and start using OFA to flex his muscles into appearing bigger.    wut?    Imagine the handjob.  It'll rip your dick off.     So what kind of righting style do you think deku will have? Im pretty sure he will sorta have different strategys depending on who he fights unlike all might who uses brute force.   All its going to be is a slightly improved normal deku  5% of that energy will be dispersed evenly throughout his body.    5% was enough to punch todoroki and send him flying upwards of 20 feet.         I thought someone said he was under best Jeanist or was that a joke?    He probably won't be able to do that if he's diluting the 5% of OFA in all his body.    Yea  Im sure, his normal fighting style will be bumped up a bit, but still allow for a 'hard hit' if need be  by utilizing all 5% into one attack        Is she pushing her boob?    I'm just gonna leave this here, hoping the chapter/raws is out by the time I come back to this thread.   It is his own identity though  a.)Cant save people with a smile of his own yet, so at least he can wear a mask with a smile on it b.)green  matches his own scheme, not of all mights at all, also green so its in line with his hero persona 'sprout'   c.)actual utility space and sturdy/practical material  Personally, I hope it stays like this.  Its at a perfect middle ground between practicality and aesthetics            Spoilers are legit, but I asked this bc the anon said Uraraka appears in some panels so I was wondering if we will also see Kacchan.     man, i'd take anything that didnt cover up his hair  horikoshi is a spiderman fan, so...    my money is he'll end up being sort of a batman/captain america light.   Peak/slightly beyond peak human efficency specwise. He'll rely on tactics/tools/preptime, with his ace being able to SMASH    Chinese scan when ?   8 hours     Best Genist   Best Jeanist   Hes wearing pants on his face      Team work Between Bakugou and Monoma?   Damn it Horikoshi    Nope, Whorikoshi got it right, those are jeans on his face    Japan loves their puns, probably because of how easy it is to make them in their language.    How old is all might then? If gran torino is at such an advanced age now this must have be years decades ago (unless he just aged horribly).      This is why this manga is great.   I want a nasty, powerfull villainess who can't stand heroics to fall hopelessly in love in Deku and keep stalking him throughout the series     keep stalking him throughout the series   Kishi, Please go.        Leblanc would be the perfect villainess. If she was way younger though, her quirk can be cloning or some such.       You'll never have a hot, powerful villain with extreme yandere tendencies falling in love with you   suffering     Man, I love this manga. I hope the anime gets a great adaptation and is long running.   as long as the anime isn't the next one piece anime-wise. i dont know how people can withstand getting steaming shit dropped in their eyes week after week    Is that Emanuell from My balls or someone else?   Summary:  "Best Jeanist isn't fond of Bakugou.  His role is to correct people like Bakugou due to is explosive personality. Meanwhile Ochako thinks Battle Hero Gunhead has a cute way of talking. She has sidekick potential... Kirishima and Tetsutesu are Training with The 4th Kind (フォースカインド) [Based on Movie Title/DUDE HAS 4 ARMS] Momo is training with Snake Hero...they're filming a commercial Deku's disappointed he hasn't done any hero training...Gran Torino is asleep so he decides to try some freerunning in an attempt to control his powers and fails badly... Deku's been having issues with the microwave to defrost fish biscuits...then he has an epiphany thanks to the how it circulates and heats all over....then boom transformation"         Not much of a spoiler, but whatever.   Midoriya is with All Might, Bakugou with Best Genist, so... Todoroki is with Endeavor? Maybe.  Top 3        Im pretty sure todo is with endeavor  Hes the only one who can even teach Todo how to use his fire side      But best genist is number 4 hero    Who the fuck is best genist?  He can manipulate genes or something?   afo?          What'd be neat is if he ended up training with Deku's dad.     The one that wears pants with a belt on his face    Deku's dad is said to be able to breath SOME fire and is implied to be a salaryman    All might's teacher looks exactly the same as my character in dragon ball xenoverse    Fuck everything.     Actually      Taco scan for ants     Well, he'll always have Bakugou    Deku and his fucking microwaves, man.   It's out  http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/374<wbr>100</wbr>     That's last weeks      Tee hee    Don't do that.     http://www.readmanga.today/boku-no-<wbr>hero-academia/48 Fa transalations are out.</wbr>  here http://www.readmanga.today/boku-no-<wbr>hero-academia/48</wbr>    That was high class. I commend you. Got me salty.       Holy shit.      Thank you sirs    Is best Best Jeanist's costume made completely of jeans?     Nigga Angels   Readmanga  Goddamn it. Oh well.      Just started reading this mango. Why is Momo-chan best girl? Can I ship her with Deku?   Also   tfw you will never get to pole okachu's cheeks        its legit   huh, who would of thought, but why are all the pages cut short?      Yes you can, although most people here like Frog or Gravity   Man, gotta love Deku and Torino's combination.  So basically, instead of surging power into one specific spot on his body and overloading/breaking his body, he wants to surge the same amount of power across his whole body. My initial reaction tells me it should make him a bit weaker but not break his body as much, and he'll be way more versatile in what he can do. Basically a do-everything buff.  Can't wait to see Best Jeanist fail at turning Baku into a proper hero.     I'd love to see Deku adopt some of the costume elements from the Heores that trained him.  He could change his shoulder things and belt to All Might's  after he passes away   And the cape from Gran Torino        Or he could wear a domino mask like Gran Torino    I like that too   So it's pretty much confirmed that Deku is going to ABSORB Toshinori.    baku turns best jeanist into a villain instead     It's basically the problem of having a mallet made out of crystal but the head is made out of titanium.  Yes, the head isn't going to break but the rest of the mallet is going to become fucking dust.      Not sure if he absorbs, if the previous user just dies, or if something happened to All Might's predecessor    Retired old pro + Newbie is always a good combination. Well, not always. I can think of a few Hollywood movies where it exist just to wack off an aging actor on screen.    so snake-chan will teach momo to slut it up?   best jeanist   hero and villain psychology   gene hero    afo confirmed? He wants to take all might down through manchild to better understand the psychology of villains  tfw this guy is orochimaru 2.0 and takes bakugou under his wing as new sauce          BRAVO HORIKOSHI    Yes, Itsuka as well. Looking forward to it.   I'm happy we got to know a little more about the hero world and seen deku expanding how he uses OFA. Best Jeanist talking mad shit just to fail! Or he may have kacchan talking shit but being polite . All might predecessor is either died or turned evil, and momo is being momo.   Amazon shilling.   Horikoshi pls.    Which kids do you want to see next chapter? I really want to see where Tapes and Kaminari wound up.  If passing on One for All makes the previous host die that's really super fucked up that All Might never told Deku.   He didn't say that Baku would be a better person, he just is gonna weed out his evil ad vindictive tendencies. I hope he shows him some real crazy shit that villains can do.     then he has an epiphany thanks to the how it circulates and heats all over....then boom transformation"  We Buff Deku now       Meanwhile Ochako thinks Battle Hero Gunhead has a cute way of talking   Ochako is being so Uraraka       "the way he speaks is cute"   ANIME CANT COME SOON ENOUGH!     I have a feeling that they die and get absorbed into the next person, so they dont really 'die'    NO, Momo can only be shipped with Girls    Let's face it EVERYONE is shipped with Deku by at least one person.      What was her name and power again?      What if Torino was the one who passed OFA to All Might?    Why is the absolute flying fuck does he have a belt on his fucki-  kek      It's been implied many times and no man would tell his fan he'll "kill" his idol.    Of OFA's maximum potential, Deku can only use 5%. Of that 5% he's been focusing all of it into instantaneous burst with a single finger as an ultimate killer move. That's what the phrase "100% of the 5%" that's come up means.  From the spoilers and the last chapter's foreshadowing, he's finally realized just how stupid that is. Now he's practicing to use that 5% constantly, instead of in bursts, and spread out over his whole body, instead of focused into a single finger. Or maybe he'll start out using 1% constantly and work his way up.  Using OFA as a passive buff instead of a killer attack will let him fight with his brain instead of overwhelming force. Which, from how often we've been shown his talent for analyzing quirks and their uses, is his real strong point.         It'll rip your dick off.  Worth it     asking the hard questions   Wait, best genist is the No. 4 ranked hero?  I thought he was No. 3      forgot the pic     You know that was pretty obvious in retrospect, now that I think about it.    We've been calling it since forever. Half of Todoroki vs Deku predictions implied he'd use OfA to increase his mobility.    I thought we were thinking of stuff like using the 100% of the 5% for more mobility, not distributing it evenly around the whole body. And in more dire situations, he can still use those 100% of the 5%o finish the fight or solve the situation when needed. One for All is pretty fucking versatile now that i think about it.      Can we stop comparing MHA to Naruto     They never said he was No.3.  Hell maybe the No.3 hero have no connection to Yuuei Academy at all compare to those three.      gosh. koheis fucking hand game is crazy. he did say drawing hands was important to him.     Isn't that normally crazy hard to draw right?   Kendou and something to do with enlarging body parts    When you get autismo and draw SHITLOAD of hands to make them perfect you'll try to shoe horn them anywhere you can.   Or so told me my painter friend.        He has said that hands are the most expressive part of the body for him     100% of the 5%  That was mistranslated and they fixed too, in the fight he was using 100%     seems like someone surpassed high-pants between the start and our current time    looking at the amount of detail he put into it, it seems like it    he was't using 100% or he would probably be dust   I've just learnt that I've been using my microwave wrongly.   It was tearing him apart, though. 5% is what he can use without breaking himself and it's still pretty damn strong. Either way, he's been using the same "big bang" tactics with both 100% and 5% when he could be fighting with 5% active all the time.    Not a completely off the wall idea, they're traditional placed right behind the face in the expressive department. just most manga and comic artist tend to down play them because of how hard they are to do well. Same thing with showing the face from more extreme angles, there's a lot of forms to control if you want to do that well.    Nah, I've seen all boku no hero academia threads and this was not mentioned, at least not this specific.    I really like what he does with the hands cause even if I don't realize it they really do help express the characters better.    I knew what you meant, just that "100% of the 5%" was not real because that was mistranslated. This guy, , thinks Deku didn't use 100% in his fight with Todoroki. It's mostly FA fault for bad translates that make most of the fanbase got things wrong. I wonder how many still think that Super Venom Chainsaw was the one to hurt All Might.     he didn't use 100% though, 100% implies that he's using 100% of all for one ,All might not even at a forth of his power was able to essentially knock noumu out of the city. 100% would probablly kill toro if it got anywhere near him   Why are we not talking about how awesome Gran Torino's personality is?    He's manchild's grandfather.    So anyone else hope hard bros eventually fight villains together and   use each other as bludgeoning weapons      So now we've had 2 Oumagadoki Zoo cameos, wonder when someone from Bulge is gonna show up.   2? I missed the other one then.      When Deku and co. start going to different planets.     aliens are always endgame    But he's the villain though. He's the Ra's Al-Ghul of the series.    This girl was in Zoo, wasn't she?    Did Ra's ever excitedly drum his hands on the table waiting for food?  You can't do that and be evil     Masturbation joke? In MY Shonen Jump?   Gonna have to save that one.    full yoda   So wait is he using 100% across his body now or just 5%?   Lets be honest. Takoyakis are pretty tasty. And we've never seen Ra eat anything but tea or fancy stuff I think.      He's using 100% of 5%.     Takoyakis are pretty tasty.  Agreed   And we've never seen Ra eat anything but tea or fancy stuff I think.  If Gran Torino drank fancy tea you'd have a point  all Brits are evil            all Brits are evil  Oxymoron.     Look at a lot of classic portrait and you'll see hands getting tons of attention even if you don't notice it right away. This Rembrandt is a great example. Only two areas are heavily detailed, the face and the hands the rest is dealt with very simply. Oh there's still modeling of form on the cloths and the background desk items, but it's clear what matters and the artist wants you to pay attention to the most.    that's not how you spell redundant   I don't think Jeanist is a hero kind of hero, he might be the fourth most popular for helping troubled kids, maybe even for the /fa/ clothes he makes.   A reform hero who stops kids from ever becoming villains in a world where everyone has super powers makes sense.    I hope this gag never ends.   The Fe on his mask is a nice touch too, FA's shitty redrawing just fuzzed it up.      No, the 5% is the maximum all parts of his body can sustain. He's going to get stronger.   most of the time after i finish reading a bnha chapter, i cant help but say out loud, "BASED DEKU'  Is all mights death going to que a time skip? No way this manga will go through all the training to be able to handle 100%   Hilarious, just hilarious.   Is it Force Kind or Fourth Kind?  Did Uraraka's heart just skip at Gunhead talking?  Kyun       Kaminari is my favorite.   It's funny because Best Jeanist is an actual dumb Japanese yearly award. Yes, that's Ken Watanabe.  I'm sure it's a direct reference made by Horikoshi.     Mei of course. I want to see a hero being her test dummy.   Asui: "Hey, can I ask you something?"  Midoriya: "Of course, spit it out."  Asui: "You said that in order for One for All to be transferred, I just have to ingest your DNA in some manner or another, right?"  Midoriya: "The method doesn't really matter, so yeah. What about it?"  Asui: *punches wall and breaks it down*  Midoriya: "..." *realization kicks in*  ---------  Gran Torino: "And that's why sex is a no-no. You are like an octopus. You have sex, genetic matter is ingested in some manner or another and you are dead before you know it. The third successor died this way and the fourth then split it between the two fifths after a rather... odd night. Locating the first fifth was easy, but the second one? Ooh, boy. He had managed to transfer his power to a sixth, who was a bit homicidal by the way, but after cutting off his arms and legs, the first fifth managed to pin him down long enough to bite him and eat him. That's actually how the fifth's power was doubled, actually. In a... forest fire manner, if you may. After that, finding a second sixth to succeed the first fifth was a bit of a pain in the ass, as word of the little incident with the second fifth had gone out and people were a bit wary about having a cannibalizing maniac as a hero."  Midoriya: "One for All's history is a lot more kinky and brutal than I expected it to be."  Gran Torino: "'Tis but child's play. Wait 'till you hear about the seventh and the eighth. Boy, was that a mess to explain to the Child Services. Brrr. My back shivers just by thinking about it."                    Baku acts just as reckless as he did before   Now has a british accent   Accent makes him more heroic   No 4 did his job         why does this guy remind me of some nice and formal nerd with his pants pulled up half way up his torso    w-what?    Jesus Christ fuck off, is this what all Tsuyufags are like?    Horikoshi you sneaky bastard.    Psst,must be 5%, if he uses 100% in some dangerous part of his body he would probably die.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGi<wbr>yDw3dOSs  Boruto  - Rasengan and Rasenshuriken - Chidori and other lightning based jutsu - Rasengan/Chidori Mix - Multi Shadow Clone - Snake Summoning - Snake based Jutsu like the shed skin - Toad Summoning - Sage Mode  Sarada  - Sharingan - Mangekyou Sharingan techniques like Susanoo and Amaterasu - Super Strength - Great Medical skills - Slug Summoning - Chakra Chains - Healing Bite  Which of the two will be better?                       </wbr>    rasengan chidori mix  no no no minato couldn't figure out how to combine lightning style with rasenga  sarada really is a medic  HA  mangekyou sharingan  FUCK           fuck off already  Boruto will be trained by a genius who also is basically a god, on the other hand Sarada will be trained by Sakura who is a great ninja (especially considering that she's a nobody) but she can't compare with Sasuke. Masters matter a lot in this manga so Boruto will win imo   But most of Sasuke's power comes from Sharingan and Hagoromo power up which Boruto won't get. He can't even train him to be as fast Lee because again you need Sharingan for that.    Sure but Sasuke is also a Raiton expert, he learned Chidori at 12 and apparently knows very well how the Rasenshuriken works.    Yeah, but Nardo combined rasengan with fire, magnet, ink, black fire, water, lava and yinyang. I'm sure Bordo can combine lightning with rasengan    I just don't know how much Sasuke outclasses Sakura as a teacher when he can't teach what mostly makes him so powerful, which is his sharingan techniques and Hagoromo power up.     chakra chains   healing bite  Well that seals it      Yamato and Kakashi couldn't teach Naruto Sharingan and Mokuton yet they managed to teach him his strongest jutsu.    Have a better link?      Can't train him to be as fast as Lee because you need the Sharingan  But...Lee is as fast as Lee, and he didn't have the Sharingan.     Have an actual working link?   chakra chains  Is there a new trailer with their confirmed abilities or are you just guessing?         Snake Summoning    Snake based Jutsu like the shed skin   he's next Orochimaru       Boruto's not gonna work as hard as Lee. Lee is a genius of hard work.      Ok Boruto    My training begins now    What you have to do, right    Is just hit, like, really hard    No, like REALLY hard    Alright that's it, good luck          I think they just taught him how to master his wind chakra then he himself came up with RasenShuriken.    I've never understood how hard word = genius in this universe. Working hard doesn't make you a genius. It makes you dedicated, which I guess when it comes to punching people, is worth quite a bit.    Genius of hard work is just something Gai called him. Real genius who don't have to work hard and finish academy at like 7 years old like Kakashi, Orochimaru, Itachi etc. are called real geniuses.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127179583  She has short hair again?   Now that I think of it, sasukes teacher so far were kakashi, who was ok but pampered him.  Itachi, who only teached him hatred.  And orochimaru.  I'm sure he picked up on how to be a great teacher.          I'm sure he picked up on how to be a great teacher  Bort left his care without wanting to crush the Leaf. That's a start.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127179583  He's angry because his mom couldn't give him a Sharingan. Staying with the Uchiha makes you obsessed by eyes.    yeah, and she's still beautiful       Which of the two will be better?   nigga who can chuck lightning bolts and finally perfected a technique two previous geniuses couldn't   versus a girl who can kinda sorta punch kinda hard and punted a Pokemon     no   no   no  Yes.              Now Boruto    If someone starts bullying you or giving you shit    Rip their spine out    And hang their body from the roof as a message to others    ...    I don't want to train anymore uncle Sasuke           best team   Sasuke teach him how to treat women. Burito successfully treat her mom.    kek     people still think Shikadai will use his mother's moves   That said, Burrito vs. Shikadai is going to be pretty damn hype. He is a very pretty girl.       finally perfected a technique two previous geniuses couldn't  Naruto isn't a genius and neither one of them ever tried mixing their attacks together or learning the other person's technique.     and he is going to OTK Boruto in a children's cardgame    Maybe Shikadai is even better than Temari and can control wind without a fan.      expression of a child who really doesn't have time for any of this bullshit     lel     Eat your food Burrito.        Inojin and Shikadai are prettier girls than the actual girl   this generation is more feminine than the previous         and neither one of them ever tried mixing their attacks together or learning the other person's technique  Didn't Kakashi invent Chidori specifically because he was too much of a scrub to add elemental chakra to Rasengan?  If you think of it Bort basically made a Rasenshuriken three years before Nurudu could.  His Rasengan still needs some work, though. Look at this cute li'l thing.         Boruto is the strongest of his generation, he's supposed to be a perfect fusion of Naruto with Sauce. No one stands a chance against him, not even Sarada fucking UCHIHA let alone a jobber's son.      Not even Sarada fucking UCHIHA    imply she's actually useful   Rightio then!        tfw you realize the only remotely masculine looking boys of this generation are Bort and Lee Jr.  What a time to be alive.     She awakened the Sahringan, that alone makes you stronger than Kiba, Shikamaru etc.     Boruto is the strongest of his generation   underestimating the dark horse that is Himawari    64 palms sage mode up this nigga        *not even Sarada fucking HARUNO  FTFY     We've never seen someone with a bullshit crazy IQ like Shikamaru go up against a Sharingan user. I reckon he'd still be able to outsmart them.     Hyuuga jutsus   useful  Nigga, wut?      https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mXl<wbr>i8ylucBg</wbr>  [ ]     implying he wouldn't just toss her cake       For my next trick, I'm going to make your heart explode by gently tapping you on the shoulder, elbow and asshole   How is that NOT useful?      Hard to be the strongest of your generation when Shino and Tenten get more trailer screentime than you.     Didn't Kakashi invent Chidori specifically because he was too much of a scrub to add elemental chakra to Rasengan?   Oh yes I forgot that. But this doesn't mean that Boruto is more of a genius than Kakashi. Kakashi was a Chunin by age 7, Boruto still's in the academy at age 12.      We did, he tried to use the shadow thing against Madara, and it didin't work.     We've never seen someone with a bullshit crazy IQ like Shikamaru go up against a Sharingan user. I reckon he'd still be able to outsmart them.     just looking into their eyes mean you lose   standing in front of them means getting blasted with various offensive eye attacks   they see your every move in advance   most of them are faster than he is   he can think of something   He would get raped. Even the most blatant Shikamaru fanboy has to admit this.  Guy been training to fight sharingan users his whole life and his best move is to look at their feet so he doesnt get blasted by the various instant win genjutsus               Hyuuga jutsus aren't inherently useful   Hyuuga jutsus bolstered with sage strength will put away anyone who isn't using regenerative ass pulls  sage mode Naruto was capable of lifting the great toad statues and what are they? around 10 tonnes at least  imagine being hit with a sledgehammer 64 times           But this doesn't mean that Boruto is more of a genius than Kakashi     Strongest in the Leaf, amirite?    Wow, I haven't seen a crater that size sense Tsunade's ax kick and Sakura's punch to that filler villain, Sarada's gonna be a powerhouse by the time she reaches the later teen years.     - Snake Summoning   - Snake based Jutsu like the shed skin      well she'll won't be the dogs bollox anytime soon  but sunflowers require time to blossom        The first Uchiha he goes up against is one of the two strongest shinobi in the last hundred years or so, recently reincarnated, with an Eternal Mangekyou and Rinnegan   Not really a level playing field by any measure, is it?      Believe me, anon, it's impressive. But considering her buddy's travelling to other dimensions and killing alien gods with homemade nukes, it pales in comparison.  Oh well, at least she'll make Hokage like she always dreamed.  The bar was lowered since Tsunade anyway.       The overarching theme of the entire franchise is the newer generation trumping the older one. Kakashi is two generations removed.     sarada becomes tsunade but 10 times stronger   she masters chakra control with sharingan   she gains so much control that she can shatter mountains or she can control how much force comes from what ever she does so that it's her whole body not just her fist.   uses medical ninjustu to repair/prevent torn muscles from rebound        An Uchiha can't be allowed to become Hokage.    Other than him, the Uchihas we've seen fighting are: Itachi, Shisui, Sasuke and Obito (bonus: Kakashi) could he beat any of them? I don't think so.    THERE IS LITERALLY NO EVIDENCE FOR HALF THE SHIT YOU LISTED  WHY DO YOU KEEP MAKING THIS THREAD  WHY        Tobirama pls go    Reminder that he nearly flat-out killed Madara, as I was so promptly reminded last night. Which means doing what he did against any of the current-generation shinobi (Obito, Sasuke, whatever), would've ended in said shinobi literally becoming guacamole.     But considering her buddy's travelling to other dimensions and killing alien gods with homemade nukes, it pales in comparison.   I doubt Boruto is just gonna throw his lightning Rasengan at the main villain that's stronger than Kaguya and they're just gonna die.      Huh? The strongest villain is one of the first ninjas. Who could only by rivaled by one his own generation. Who then got made stronger by taking the power of his old rival. And the only thing that could stop him was an even more ancient evil taking over him.  And the only thing that saved the day was an ancient good guy giving his powers to the newer people.  How is the new generation worth jackshit?          Nurudu and Sauce will probably soften Momo-kun up and give him an opening. In the trailer he throws a Rasengan from inside of Sauce's Susanoo.    I believe that's exactly what's going to happen.   Here's a question I thought of on the way to work:  Could an Uchiha copy the 8 Trigrams 64 Palms with their Sharingan? Yes, they wouldn't know the exact chakra point locations, but they'd instantly be able to copy the strikes.     Isn't that how every Nurudu movie ends?    It's pretty obvious what their powers are gonna be. You should have known Sarada was gonna get super strength before this chapter.    https://<span>youtu.be/n3Gqc5S6t2U  [ ]    It's useless if you don't have the chakra control. You'd just be impotently poking your opponent.    Obito casts Kamui and Sasuke casts amaterasu and Itachi is itachi    The Last ended with Hinata ripping out Toneri's eyes and him staying on the moon. Of course, this was after Naruto punched him hard enough to create a shockwave in an area with no atmosphere, so there's that.    No, they want nothing to do with fodder-tier clans jutsus.   Wheres all the time-space jutsu? Its a shame that it flying thunder god style will die out since minato didnt get to teach it to naruto(who didn't need it because he surpassed it with the ninetail cloak).   every enemies chakra holes are in different spot. They would only be able to do it on the very exact same enemy. Which is pointless.    I reckon, like with all of these types of shows, the older something is, the more powerful it is. There are exceptions to the rule, like Naruto or Sasuke, but by an large, older generations of shinobi have stronger powers.    the last did not    At least she'll be able to punch Bort into the next town when he starts bragging about how he spent time with both her dad and his.      Obito casts Kamui    Sasuke casts Amaterasu   You can't hurt what you can't see. Reminder that Four Gates Lee was moving faster than the eye could see, and Gai was in Eight Gates mode against Madara. Even WITH the Sharingan, they'd see a blur. And you can't focus on a blur.       Uchiha are ninjutsu and genjutsu users. Hyuuga instead are taijutsu users, the 64 palms makes sense beacuse it's very fast and allows the user to close a lot of chakra points, the jutsu itself isn't anything special without the Byakugan.     the uchiha uses izanagi as guy kills them.   guy then proceeds to die because taijutsu is fucking shit      Hopefully not-Pikachu learns it along with every Raiton technique in the book.    He's gonna lose against Boruto.    Not if aliens attack before the judges reach their verdict.      Immediately lock out an eye forever   You'd better fucking hope Gai runs out of steam after that one attack (which he didn't against Madara), because after that you have one more Izanagi and then you're blind and lose all of your Sharingan powers.      Implying she won't just punch a clone.     You can't hurt what you can't see  Welp, Sasuke realized this when he faced the Raikage, you just need to use amaterasu on susanoo.     Which the Raikage actually gave NEGATIVE fucks about and continued with his attack anyway.  Raikage is seriously the coolest kage.      Af if that counts as anything.  That would mean Shikadai avoided the bullet or delayed the inevitable.      how the fuck do you just chop off your arm and not think of how this will impact you in the future    At the cost of his arm and he was going to lose his leg as well if Gaara didn't block him. Too hotheaded.    But Sasuke would be dead so it would be worth it.  Also this is why everyone needs to learn the shed skin for shit like amaterasu.         Trading and arm and a leg to stop, at that point, probably the second or third strongest ninja that threatens the entire world   Probably thought it was worth.       Why does a 12 year old genin get to go on a mission with Sasuke and 4 kages to go rescue princess Naruto?    why boruto's sister isn't even mentioned in this manga? I don't even know her name     looks out the window in his pjs.   suddenly he's outside in his armor on the ground  What?       kill sasuke   Kaguya's plan worked and we are fighting the aliens now   What ever happened to the alien invasion anyway  will it happen off panel like medaka box?          had Gaara not stopped him he would've crushed sauces skull at the cost of his foot  Sounds like a cool trade     There was never an alien invasion planned what are you talking about. However in Boruto their will be aliens which will be killed.    Himawari. She's still pretty young - I'm guessing like six or seven. She'll probably have a few lines in the movie.   m8 he created the Flying Thunder God. He can go wherever he wants in whatever clothes he wants.         She is not an relevant character.    what are you talking about  Kaguyas entire plan was to turn everyone into white zetsus to fight the aliums      Now that I think about it sasuke is lucky to be alive.  Be brings him to deaths door twice   raikage knocks his shit in and prepares to kill him   mizukage fully prepared to kill him   had danzo not been a condescending douche he would've killed sasuke   madara puts him on death's door  Sasuke got shafted alot.           NScucks      The ayyliens get defeated by a 12 year old kid and his two daddies   Bravo Kaguya        inb4 humanity is annihilated because without all the White Zetsu soldiers, humanity can't work cohesively enough to fight the aliens.     Niggers.    He wanted to. And he turned out to be more useful than those 4 jobber fucks anyway, so it all works out in the end.    To be fair she was an idiot. All boobs and no brains, goddess or not.    How would the 4 presiden fare against ayyriens?      Turns entire world into ice    Doesn't just crystalise the oxygen that's in their lungs   The stronger a being is, the less likely they are to efficiently kill the heroes.       They get their asses kicked like every battle they're in and the 12 year-old will have to finish the job.  Truly a dark day for shinobi everywhere. Except Hiashi. He's probably digging this shit.  Also it just me or do this nigga's horns make him look like a Playboy bunny?        Yes but that wasn't explained until Gaiden. We didn't even know aliens existed until The Last when it was revealed the Otsutsuki come from the moon. However now that they've explained that was her plan, they're gonna do it in the Boruto movie.    Gaara looks like the fleet admiral from Legend of Korra.    Basically if I had to guess Kaguya had some other enemies on the moon and tried to cultivate the earth's population to serve as her army. And judging from the fact there were a fuckton of White Zetsu just lying around it looks like she's done this retarded shit before.   Because turning everyone into the same jobber plant person is better than having a bunch of different soldiers who have every set of skills under the sun. If the Allied Shinobi could make mulch out of her plant army, then it's not a very effective army, is it?      You think sasuke now has a fear of cloud ninja? Like the talk big shit on ninja 4chan but shits himself whenever one so much as raises a hand in his direction? literally every time he's come to blows with one they knock the ever loving shit out of him. Like he probably refuses to teach salad lighting release out of fear of having to share a house with someone who could use lariat.    We aliens now  I was still waiting for The Last BD so thats a surprise to me. Yet I kinda like it. Make it so Kaguya was preparing for aliens and the the whole lol bunny goddess doesnt seem as retarded.       he looks annoyed whenever he sees Chouchou but that's only because he's secretly terrified of her      Make it so Kaguya was preparing for aliens and the the whole lol bunny goddess doesnt seem as retarded  This. It's still fucking stupid that Nurudu ended with fighting some dumb alien bimbo when MADARA FUCKING UCHIHA was already the main antagonist for hundreds of chapters, but at least it shows that Kishi is sticking to his guns with this alien bullshit, as retarded as that is.       While he never contacted Sakura or Sarada during those twelve years, he always sent a present of food to Choji on his birthday to keep in Choji's missus' good books. Just in case.      Space Gaara      Like he probably refuses to teach salad lighting release out of fear of having to share a house with someone who could use lariat.      turns entire world into ice   this never happened, she teleported them to a world that was covered in ice       Like he probably refuses to teach salad lighting release out of fear of having to share a house with someone who could use lariat   instead he teaches it to the kid who can clone himself a dozen times for a dozen more lariat   Sauce is not a clever man.      Then why the shitting dick didn't she just leave them there? Or the lava planet? Just *vwoop* here you go, bye *vwoop*    Minato says otherwise.  Muh teleportation  Minato was insanely fast without it, and his reflexes were godly, which was the whole point. He could react to things that Sasuke had serious trouble with.      have you seen the fight or has someone just given you the gist of it?  she tried to maroon Sasuke in one of the worlds but Saukra and coolest guy were able to retrieve him   in the meantime, Naruto soloed Kaguya with sexy jutsus        He hasen't been father of the year to sarada so she's more likely to lariat him than boruto. But he doesn't teach boruto how to use a sword just to be safe.    Yes, Exactly.    Dumping them in lava was the first thing she did. Against anyone else that would have been it but Naruto can fly.    I have, but I've honestly forgotten like 80% of it. I'm re-reading the entire thing from the beginning. Now that you bring it up, I do remember Sakura and Obito getting him back, yes.    obito could dimension hop. Why she didn't just trap them in seperate worlds after she killed him? Kishimoto is a hack. That's how you explain literally everything.     hfw Bort spends a few years in Kumo to bang delicious brown chicks and study under based B    Is Chapter 699.5 worth watching?  Also I haven't started this new series. Is it planned to be ongoing or is it just some mini-series thing? I don't speak moon so I'm not sure if that's what's implied by "Gaiden".     Seems pretty stupid that she can't teleport them actually inside the lava so they die immediately.    It's bretty good for a shoujo. Not so good for a shounen. But only an idiot would watch it for any reason other than to see delicious NH goodness.    It's NaruHina the movie. If comfy cheese is your thing then yeah you'll like it.    Why do people say Sakura is the real mother because of this page?  The super strength is not hereditary, it is taught.      All the older generations featured generally had some Mary-Sue shit going on for them.   That and time. Madara was well over a hundred years old.   The older Hokages were only featured when they had the advantage of being able to take huge amounts of damage with the expectation of regeneration.         The real reason he never cam home during his cigarette mission was because he heard a cloud ninja lives there now.   He literally pretends chouchou doesn't exist the entire gaiden to keep from freaking out.      I think she needed to physically grab them in order to separate them via dimensions   after the first time she tried it, they were wise to it and also Kakashi temporarily had double kamui abilities so it wouldn't have worked after Obito died either way      it wasnt explicitly stated but if she needed an army and every living sentient being on earth was under he control then surely the enemies were from outer space.    Maybe the aliums use some sort of attacks that are effective against disorganized people and not against a hive mind structure  like its really hard to get people to suicide for the greater good for example in mass numbers. Zetsu army would be far superior in terms of that         Because Sarada is now meant to be a combination of Sasuke and Sakura, rather than the girl Sasuke we all thought she was going to be.    Nobody thought it was aliens. People who did come up with theories probably thought it was just some ancient enemy locked away.    What? Pretty much everyone came to the conclusion of aliens  https://archive.moe/_/search/text/k<wbr>aguya%20aliens/order/asc/page/2/   That's exactly what was implied   </wbr>      sarada becomes the ninja version of ALL MIGHT       Bee teaches Bort to rap   Bort becomes Eminem like his father before him     Do people actually like the pink girl?   Not bad considering there shouldn't have been any atmosphere to create a shockwave with.  I think that 'breathing on the moon' thing was the only part of the movie that bugged me. The rest I was happy with.      God Netori was a chump.      I thought it was pretty easy to explain. People lived on/in the moon so it was given breathable atmosphere.    She is so moe!    The best is Naruto wasn't at full power and he still tanked everything Netori threw at him.   Only the novel bothered to explain saying because of ninja magic the moon had a breathable atmosphere.       The Nardo moon isn't like our moon. It's a construct by Hagoromo. Hamura probably willed some atmosphere on there.    Inside the moon I could hazily get away with by 'something something portal to earth', but on the surface of the moon was a bit much.  Still very enjoyable. Credits scene was excellent.      Because they are delusional.     When will people ever learn that Sarada's similitudes with Sasuke were only meant to be fenotypical (and genotypical to an extent)? Kishimoto never wanted to recreate SasuNaru from their kids.  Bort and Sarada are nothing like their parents.       Well, Bort is Yang and Sarada is Yin, but aside from that they're pretty different.     Look at this cute li'l thing.   Could it be that he doesn't have as much chakra like his dad?      tfw he could of killed best girl    I think he was still learning on properly making it. At least that's the impression I got.     bandicam watermark   facebook watermark   youtube video suggestions   everything else wrong   Why would you do this         What are you talking about  Bort is a carbon copy of the chapter 1-20 naruto        Chakra retention. They probably had as many chakra as Nagato would have but due to his young age the amount he could retain is small. Look at how Minato forms his 'regular' rasengan, its the same size as naruto's first 'oodama' rasengan.      The impression I am getting is that he barely has chakra, even his shadow clones were just two.     Sarada is Yin   I don't see it.        I made this       Shikamaru saving his waifu  I bet Temari was pissed and also more in love.    why do ss fans hate sasuke not having one arm so much?  yfw realise that bolt is pretty much konohamaru personailty wise who acts like a retard because they're father figures dont have a enough time to spend with them and personality changes when their naruto(sasuke) teach them otherwise.     B-baka! It's not like I needed your help or anything!     i thought that was a given since naruto can pretty much draw chakra from the tailed beast       Between    I RATHER HAVE NO PARENTS THAN HAVING ONE AS YOU   And    He definitely is one, anon. Sure.            wait, what episode is this?      bridal style    one arm   no wonder they think ss is the best romance ever told        Quiet   Subdued   Uchiha   Wanted to be alone  She's a Yin through and through.         Himawari will still forgive her onii-chan but will forever remind everyone around her how much of a dick Burrito was on that day.   Himawari is the type of girl that forgives but does not forget       pretty much draw chakra from the tailed beast  He couldn't do that when small. That's just recent, the tail chakra was always red and his blue.     234 maybe      On this day, my brother's wedding, I'd like to draw his mind back to when I was six...    Boruto's smile drops    No    She can't still hold that grudge    Himawari locks eyes with her brother and slowly walks over to the wedding cake    Hinata and Naruto look at each other    Oh shit    She wouldn't    Himawari flips the table that has the wedding cake    Cake goes everywhere    Himawari drops mic    Exit stage left                It's a shame they stopped doing omake. They were mildly amusing.  that one heartbreaking omake after Hinata vs. Pain      https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=B7-<wbr>aX3Lvz6M</wbr>  [ ]  Imagine watching the anime only and seeing this after it looked like Hinata got murdered.      NOPE. CANNOT DEAL.  I have shed too many  un  manly tears over this fucking show.       Bort and Salad confirmed playable  What do you think their team ultimate will be?      your dad is better than my dad no jitsu     He's just new, Satan. Konohamaru could make the same size, and he still splattered a Pain with it.   Did he really just try and kill Temari with a Rasengan? Goddammit Konohamaru. I bet Bort learned it just by watching you trying to kill him with it whenever he shittalked his dad.       He's a lot more serious than Konohamaru because he isn't a joke character.    10/10   These bitches need some dick.       The ones I remember most are Hinata winning the ramen eating contest and anytime everyone acted like actors in a show.    It will be nothing special unlike the ultimates with their own parents (Or when Boruto is with Sasuke and Sarada is with Naruto)    Seriously, casual sex partners for Tsunade would be lining up around the corner.     splattered  The Pain didn't even go down permanently. It was the reviving Pain - if Konohamaru had been able to kill it, Naruto's battle would've been a lot easier.    Any bets on how Suigetsu screwed up the DNA test?   Unless he straight up used the wrong sample from Karin he performed it properly.    He didn't. Karin is the mom. However if he did its some technical nonsense that doesn't make sense in real life because that's already not how a paternity/maternity test works in real life.      Also we already have the page of Sasuke and Sakura apologizing. There is nothing to apologize for if sakura is the mother.       Suigetsu did the test correctly.  The only chance he could have "messed up" the test, would be will be in the actual sample he used was the correct one or not.  Said sample can only belong to either Sasuke or Karin.   1:1000 chance: That it would be Sarada'a cord.  0:000000:chance: Sasuke's cord or anything from Sakura.              Bort and Salad start bickering   enemy is in the middle   their argument continues to heat up   eventually the enemy eats both a Raiton Rasengan and a hulk smash punch to the face   ends with a huge explosion and the two of them are still arguing         He probably didn't. The only possibility is that the sample was not from Karin.    Because she raised her.  Of course Sakura is the mother.      I can't see Sarada &amp; Naruto having a team ultimate. Having a team name maybe since she looks up to him.    The real mother  not the fairy cuckmother.  No one here calls iruka Naruto's dad.         Hokages are dumb!   Hokages aren't dumb!    Only losers want to be Hokage!   Stupid Boruto! I'm the one who'll be Hokage!   Will not!    Will too!   Will not!   BORUTOOO   SARADAAA               Naruto himself considers him an actual father figure if he asked him to the wedding like such.      maybe he was apologizing for being gone thus causing this angst fest?    Healing bite is from Uzumaki Clan so its more likely Himawari to have it than Sarada.    It's sasuke's cord that karen got through the power of incredibly shit writing.    Because Iruka didn't literally raise Naruto from birth. Iruka considers Naruto to be like a little brother, even though Naruto considers him to be more like a father figure.   I didn't watch the anime itself for a fucking LONG ass time  did the anime reach to Guy wreking Madara's shit?       Brozoned again     Karin is an Uzumaki, as was Nagato. Both she and Kushina could do the chakra chain.     It starts next week.    He was more of a father than Kakashi or even Jiraiya.  Minato is excused for obvious reasons, unless you are from the camp who like to joke about him preferring to be dead before being a widowed single father.      It's sasuke's foreskin that karin got by circumcising him in his sleep   Its pretty annoying Naruto is starting to become a jobber just so the kids get some scenes in.   Healing bite is from Orochimaru's experiments. Chakra chains are the Uzumaki power.     It's about the bonds that tie them rather than the blood.  Naruto considers Iruka a father and Sasuke a brother.         what I am saying is no one here will pretend he is though despite him being a father figure  it doesn't matter if sakura raised sarada  if it turns out karin is the mother when we say "sarada's mom" everyone will think of Karin not cuckura the same way naruto's dad will always be yondaime.          The actual point being, Iruka is family to him.    im starting to think naruto doesn't even give a fuck about fighting anymore, even at the partwhere he summons alot of clones to fight the shins he hasnt even used rasengan yet or even actively tried to attack someone. It seems like he's more concerned about salad not turning into sasuke.2.0    It just said he couldn't figure out how to add a chakra nature to it. We don't know what Minato's chakra nature was, so you're wrong. And even if you were right, Boruto isn't Minato. Fucking Naruto was able to add his. Why can't Boruto be able to surpass Naruto, like the film implies?     Naruto considers Iruka a father      We don't know what Minato's chakra nature was  Fire, wind and lightning       It seems like he's more concerned about salad not turning into sasuke.2.0   Can you blame him?        After witnessing the DNA test, I guess he sort of connected with Sarada in that aspect.  And well, he also was worried why Sasuke or Sakura never told him about this.   And extramarital activities implications. But those seemed more Suigetsu's implications.         That and with her uzumaki + Uchiha chakra there would be no one to stop her but him or sasuke if she ever got rolling.    Harry Potter may had known who is parents were but he still saw Serious Black as a sort of father to him as well.     Mangekyou Sharingan   Are you stupid? She'll get blind.       not having more than one dad     Only if she uses it for every single fucking problem that pops up like Itachi does.  Or, you know, she'll just take dad's eyes when he's older      Guy is about to fuck up Madara in the anime   Will it be good  it better fucking be        implying she won't take her father's eyes      Didn't paste for some reason   High quality job is high quality.      with how few times she would need it she should be able to go her whole life before going blind.   Sasuke spammed it post time skip because he had enemies stronger than him everywhere   The world is in a current state of peace and only bolt or himawari or that orochimaru clone freak should possibly have more potential than her. And they are all on her side.          Can Sasuke and Sarada just trade eyes or is that cheating      Again anon:  Who was in Naruto's wedding as a family figure?  Not Kushina nor Minato, but that would be an ashollish way to put it, since they are fucking dead.        Naruto's "Because I got to watch you grow up as your father" line in the trailer reminds me of this.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5JA<wbr>HAFvcr2o</wbr>  [ ]     Which makes me wonder. What if Salad and Boruto got married? I mean, Salad does have Uzumaki ancestry and so does Boruto. Since Naruto and Karin are cousins, then what does that make Boruto and Salad?    That was objectively the second best Rocky move after Rocky IV    distant cousins.   They are further apart than the Uchihas marrying uchihas or the Hyuugas marrying Hyuugas  Also you have to remember in Japan they aren't as crazy about cousins fucking like the US are.        Naruto considers Iruka as an older brother and father.   You could say an uncle.    You won't get anywhere with putting a tag on it since Naruto doesn't have any idea about families. He's just precious to him.          Also you have to remember in Japan they aren't as crazy about cousins fucking like the US are.   What do you mean by that? You mean that it's okay to marry a cousin in Japan?      It has to be brothers. Unless Kishi says fuck logic   Bort is being a little shit, but imagine being in his shoes. He has a problem with his dad and if he tries to tell anyone about it, they respond with "Kid, he is literally the best human on the planet. Suck it the fuck up." No wonder he's getting all pissy.    &gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cou<wbr>sin_marriage</wbr>    people aren't aware of the world around them       Yeah. Arranged marriages between cousins is normal in japan.    doesn't he actually call iruka uncle iruka?     powerlevel bullshit   Who cares?     This chapter was fucking stupid.  Oh hey I have super strenght because WHY THE FUCK NOT?  You can't get super strenght like that, you need to learn how to do it.       And it's also common to keep their umbilical cords with them.    she learned how to off screen before the series started    No, Iruka sensei.     video was removed  Someone got that shit and uploaded it again, right?      hey kishi, fujos are really angry about sakura being cucked   oh shit what do i do   i know     So dream is dead ?             Piss off already, you dumb cunt.        She saw her mom do it. She copied it with her latent sharingan.  Have you forgotten the Copy Ninja already?!  Also, if she's some genetic mishmash experiment, who says techniques weren't just piled into her because science?         kakashi, who was ok  No   Orochimaru  made his living turning random fucks into dangerous weapons.         fairy cuckmother     Why would fujos give a shit about Sakura?  If anything they'd be pissed at her for making Sasuke pretend he's a straight married man instead of having a gay roadtrip with Naruto.     Why do you guys keep calling Sakura, my waifu since childhood, a "cuck"?  I dropped the anime after the original series ended by the way. The one where they're teenagers seemed like too much emo grimdark crawling in my skin shit.      You're making it sound like some Cell type of shit where moves can be passed down genetically, that's bullshit. That's Pokemon.  Besides, doesn't it take just being really strong to throw punches? It's not like Sakura or Tsunade throw a punch in a special way, they just throw it really hard.        because he was too much of a scrub to add elemental chakra to Rasengan?  So was the guy who invented the Rasengan.     Orochimaru wasn't much of a teacher.  He just experimented on Sasuke most of the time, that's why Sasuke is so strong after time-skip.       If they do another UNS4 trailer I want a part where these two just fucking wail on Kaguya.     No, they concentrate chakra in a point and then make it BOOOOOOOOOOM when they punch/kick or whatever.    Well the only living Uchiha through the story were the most OP of each generation.    minato could of probably been able to able to add elemental nature to it if he wouldn't have died so early    because you have shit taste, any version of Sakura licks clits.    Keep things unresolved but ambiguous.  And then having some random scene with Sarada doing chakra chains in the movie and call it a year and still saying that Sakura is the mom because irreplaceable bonds.      Which is why Sauce needs to knock up another bitch for her spare.   Sarada will become Hokage just because Burrito doesn't care, huh. What kind of rivalry is that?   I'm gonna become Hokage!   Sure, whatever. Who cares?       The thing is that CREATING a new technique and learning it is not the same thing.   Also Kakashi couldn't CREATE it make it because chakra reserves. Minato couldn't CREATE it because he died.   Naruto had the chakra so he created the jutsu with his super training of making 10000 clones try it together.  Bolt just learned the technique.            What if Salad and Boruto got married?  Don't spoil the surprise, anon.     Oh. I didn't remember this being mentioned but it makes sense. I know this kind of thing is mentioned in Yu Yu Hakusho and Saint Saiya, but not Naruto.  Still though, it may not be that difficult of a technique to pull off. Sakura may had taught her at some point.      because sauce and pink shit aren't living together post-series, their daughter has glasses unlike any of the uchihas or known harunos, nobody is willing to tell her the circumstances of her birth, a DNA test showed Karin (sauce's side bitch post-timeskip) to be the mother, and sakura gets super pissed when a villain tells her that genes are what matter instead of parenting.  Could be a giant troll, but nobody really will know till the epilogue gaiden ends next week.      Honestly I wonder if he even knows about his dad's upbringing.    Why would you bother? 64 palms is ONLY useful for capturing your opponent, if you just want to take them down any major organ is a better target than tenketsu.    Orochimaru is the Gero-equivalent. So, yeah, he could totally just transplant abilities around. That was, like, literally his thing for the entire series.  And I also told you: sharingan copying.      They're competing for the Naruto D.      Sasuke never wanted to be Hokage (until the very end and even then not the kind of Hokage Naruto was thinking of) but they still had a rivalry. Also Boruto wants to surpass the Hokage meaning he wants to surpass Sarada so there's a rivalry concept.     No, she wants to become Hokage BECAUSE she admires Naruto.  Boruto barely has nothing to do with that.  It's.probably Boruto the one that gets more pissed because she will be working to become a representation of someone he hates.         Their rivalry will exist  in the bedroom.      Naruto and Sasuke   exceptions to the rule  The reason they're so strong is being ancient god reincarnations.       Salad forces Bort to call her "Hokage-sama."     You need to have perfect chakra control and stuff like that.  Sakura learned it because she was always a genius for stuff like that.      I'm not sure it's ever said directly, but are the organ kill strikes done through tenketsu chakra injections or are they just straight through the flesh?    Only Sasuke is like that. Naruto inherited the spirit of the fuckup. Asura was a loser who couldn't do anything right and needed to rely on others for help but found strength through cooperation. Indra was the genius who thought he could do everything by himself.    Exactly.  And that why the keikaku shit like  Is useless, even as a joke.      When Boruto's not home Salad gets a visit from hokage-sama.     The super strength is not hereditary  It might be.  The only other practitioner never had kids. Bloodlines got to start somewhere.       wait where is this gif from? a new trailer?     Their rivalry won't be as intense as their fathers. They'll probably just try and one-up each other in terms of prowess and power and have totally different personal dreams.  Sauce was Nurudu's rival and he didn't want to become the Hokage until the very end, and that was just him being crazy.   Basically they'll just have constant dick measuring contests. All of which Salad will automatically lose because she is a girl and has no dick.         Lamarck plz .     reincarnations   Transmigrations* Same thing Obito did for Kakashi.         as a kid his dad never had time for him because of his hokage job   as an adult his waifu won't have time for him because of her hokage job    He should try to start a communist uprising       https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oWK<wbr>4dyO1E5s</wbr>  [ ]     mfw the movie is at 60 fps     Kakashi and Obito never reached Indra/Asura status like Hashirama/Madara or Naruto/Sasuke.      implying he has any interest in feeding welfare kumos/akimichis    Ok gentlemen, it's time to fix Boruto's character and make him likeable.   Speak up!     No. Who said they did?  Obito just transmigrated for a while, he didn't want to stay with kakashi you disgusting degenerate.  He needs to spend time with his dead waifu and he said so.       it would have been all backwards as well    kakashi is indra   obito is ashura   Obito gets broken eyes and chakra   kakashi gets shit all because he isn't from an eye using family            Hello. I've been scanning through naruto threads sometimes after it ended because I stopped reading it long ago and was interested in how it ended. Anyways I found that Kakashi was made hokage but I never see any mention of anything happening while he was.  SO  Did nothing happen when he was hokage, or was he hokage for such a short time that nothing important could've happened?         I like him already.   He's cocky and looks down on being a hokage shit      How about he gets a fucking hobby and stops worrying whether he can hang out with his dad all the fucking time    Moon kebab tried to destroy the earth and NTR Nurdu but Nurdu stopped his plan and reverse-cucked him.    He made a fucking city.   Also there's the light novels I think one of them is about Kakashi       Which part of retardville are you from?     Plenty of things happened during Kakashi's rule.  Mainly, more technology. Konoha is a fucking city now. Everyone has tablets and laptops and cellphones.  And none of them used by Sasuke to give a call to his daughter.         the cake is a lie   Some sort of poetry from Studio Pierrot.      What if Sasuke doesn't even know what cellphones and laptops are?    Minato probably could have done a lot of shit if he hadn't died so early, but he did.        ... I'm just going to believe that bad guys were too afraid of Kakashi to try to stir shit up.         You forgot Boruto's ultimate weapon  MASS. LIGHTNING. SHADOW CLONES.  Remember all of Naruto's shadow clones that got fucking slaughtered over the course of the series?  Well image that, except when the enemy stabs the clone, it explodes into lightning.  A thousand clones, nigga. Whole battlefield becomes an electric minefield. The mines can punch you in the face. Zap muthafucka.              Like I said, there's a LN about a mission Kakashi goes against some fuckers. I think Shikamaru tags along(don't know about the shikamaru part but Kakashi does go on to fight muslims). I haven't read it.     So is movie going to be about Boruto wrecking everyone and than someone defeats him like that neji cuck ?   I didn't think Naruto could get worse than it was during the final battle, the mangaka has a real talent for making things worse   Asura awakened powers equal to his brother through training and they have clearly passed down.    Transmigrations  reincarnations        It's straight through the flesh. It's described that hitting them hard doesn't matter because what they're doing when striking someone is forcing chakra into them which causes internal injuries. The air palm move works the same way.    I think the point of Boruto is to be unlikeable.  Kinda like Ben Tennyson or Otto Rocket.      Remember when all the Jonin jump in to stop Neji from dropping Hinata? Because he was about to shoot a chakra spike through her heart.    Lightning clones take more chakra than Shadow ones.  Kakashi makes one clone and eats half his chakra, and he can make shadow clones no problem(not A LOT like Naruto but a decent ammount if needed).   Boruto should have a nice chakra pool like Naruto did in case Hyuuga genes didn't fuck that up but even if he did the most he could manage would be 10 clones and he's die of chakra loss        I like him already.   You know the BS with Salkads parentage is going to be 'karin let sosukeh nom her and their chakra and dna mixed - then sosukeh screwed sakura. the child ended up as the spawn of three parents'    Well no matter who was Hokage, anyone who tried stirring shit up would have to deal with fact that Jesus and Jesedgus would fucking ruin their day if they even thought about starting another conflict  Plus I imagine a lot of that time would be spent recovering from insane injuries and fucking like it was the last day to have sex, every day.   Then as years go on and shit calms down, the dust settles, you've finally got some guys who let the peaceful era think it'll be easier to get away with petty shit again. Kids who weren't in the war. Voldemort and Magneto's abortion copping a bad attitude. Natural stuff.         Put him in a dress.   Guys wait. Hold on a second...I though the series was called Baruto? Where the hell is he?   Damn, she needs a lot more lewds like this. All the stuff on Sankaku is SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT.    Transmigration is not the same as reincarnation. It's just chakra that's left behind after death because the original users were powerful.That chakra chooses someone that fits the role and when they die the chakra goes on.  Reincarnation would imply the same soul, they're not the same soul.       November was a fun month.     I reject your headcanon and replace it with my own!      I though the series was called Baruto?   When was that ever said? NARUTO GAIDEN: THE SEVENTH HOKAGE.   Don't see any Boruto in the title        Don't question it, nobody cares about that little runt.     in case Hyuuga genes didn't fuck that up  If anything they greatly increased his chakra control, hence the Rasengan with no clones at fucking 12.     He's getting series-cucked.  Haven't you noticed that this is the theme of the manga?      if himawari devolpes breasts like momma hinata, i don't know if i will be able to hold my boner power back anymore.    Are you dumb? Kakashi himself says so. Lightning clones waste a lot more chakra.  Shadow clones are not strong anon, they're pretty shitty.      Didn't this happen with Naruto when they focused exclusively on Sasuke forever?    I don't know that's why I said in case they did and then said that even if he has the same ammount of chakra he still can't do 1000 lightning clones like anon said.  Jesus christ hyugafags are annoying.       <br/>      novel  Wait, Naruto had a novel, what are they? If so, is it translated?      A shadow clone defeated the 3rd Raikage, fuck outta here with that shit. By the time Naruto got jesus juice, his shadow clones were each no less deadly or vulnerable than he himself.   I know lightning clones waste chakra. I'm saying that chances are Boruto that motherfucking Uzumaki Gatorade blood that makes him able to store chakra while he stores chakra. I'm saying he's gonna be able to do it just by virtue of his clan and OP-ass father, the biggest chakraheads in the series.  And let me remind you: defeating the lightning shadow clone is what's SUPPOSED to happen. Unlike when Naruto's clones get beat up, every time a lightning clone is touched is an attack. It's kamikaze tactics, son, only you've got a thousand electric suicide bombers blowing themselves up for you.  Why? Because you got the goddamn Dadruto genes.           you do know you can put more chakra than normal in shadow clones right? and kakashi just said they take more chakra than normal but take up nowhere near hald of his chakra probably nowhere near a 4th of it. thats like saying naruto can only use rasengan 2 times or sasuke can only use black flames twicebecause it takes a lot of chakra. besides they shouldn't take that much more than a normal clone and naruto could make a 100 of those at bolts age    They gave Hinata lightning nature just so that Burrito could use the Chidori     they focused exclusively on Sasuke forever?  That's still happening,   his dick is the main source of drama of the gaiden   he just one-shot the main villain   he leads a mission to rescue Naruto in the movie   only relevant next gen kids are his daughter and his pupil           All according to keikaku    Minato had lightning too     A shadow clone defeated the 3rd Raikage  A NARUTO SHADOW CLONE YOU FUCKING RETARD, a clone made AFTER he became buddies with KURAMA, after he perfected SENNIN MODE.   If you try to tell me Boruto is anywhere near Naruto's shoes I'll just kill myself.  Like I said, he could manage to do that, he can't do 1000 clones like you said so. That's the entire point.  If Naruto wanted to he can make 1000 Lightning clones with his huge ammount of chakra(he has all chakra elements), but not Boruto.         people are taking about further down the road boruto not current boruto, thought that was apparent. ofcourse he isint going to be able to use a lot of clone like that as a kid, but naruto could make like a 100 shadow clones as a kid and bolts is a prodigy he should be able to do more/double that.     Fuck outta here nerd, a shadow clone is a shadow clone, and the clone took care of business with witnesses. End of story.  Could Boruto get a form to equal up with Naruto's EoS insanity? Possibly, motherfucker. We're talking literal aliens are the bad guys now, there is no rhyme or reason for you to set a ceiling to what could happen.   Boruto being a chakra monster is not a stretch.          fire and lightning    As a person grows the amount of chakra they can retain increases, right?  If Bort's already pulling off shadow clones like they're nothing and can into both Rasengan and Chidori, it's not difficult to say he's going to be a monster as an adult.   Salad too I guess.        chakra lasers and lightning    Naruto reserves were always described as monstrous and not the norm way back in part one. He was already creating hundreds of clones without dying in the first chapter. Plus he couldn't use Kurama's chakra at the time.    Not so mention he was using one of the highest tier secret forbidden shadow clone techniques, and he was mastering it since the day he graduated the academy. His been using it so many times and have been tweaking, improving and using it in so many diffrent ways that he litterally made it his best technique, then added ninetails huge chakra to it and made them sturdier with nature chakra using sage mode.  Also shadow clones power/sturdiness depends on the originals chakra and Naruto is a Uzamaki with ninetails chakra and nature chakra manipulator. Basicly his clones were almost as strong as the originals       In that case it's entirely possible.   Hashirama was a chakra monster.  You know how much chakra he had? same amount Alliance randoms after being infused with Naruto chakra.   So Hashirama had like 1/20000 (or whatever ammount of randoms were in the alliance when Nardo did it) of the ammount Naruto has. That's the Kyuubi, it's fucking INSANE.  Boruto could get more chakra if he learned sennin mode, like Hashi did.              It's any close blood relative for the Eternal. So a mother, father, sibling, son or daughter would probably do the trick. A cousin would probably be pushing it. Anything further than maybe one degree away most likely wouldn't have the genetic compatibility.    Salad couldn't use Sauce's then, because they're actually Itachi's    I don't believe her Sharingan was activated when Sakura punched the house down or when she punched Shin the first time. It activated when the DNA test was revealed.    The lion palm thing should be incredibly powerful considering she's basically putting lightning AND shitting on your pressure points.   That's filler.       I don't think there was proof of experimentation. Orochimaru wasn't to keep his Uchiha blood pure, since the plan was to inhabit his body. Orochimaru wouldn't have risked ruining that with genetic fuckery.     Boruto could get more chakra if he learned sennin mode, like Hashi did  The question now is Toad or Dragon?     It requires rather fine chakra control. Too little and your hand goes smush as your hit the ground super hard, too much and your hand goes smush as you hit too fucking hard for your own good.     Now that we're talking about Hinata's powers.  Pic related makes me realize how much of a fucking scrub she is compared to Neji since the motherfucker did at age 13 what she barely managed at 17.   Actually It just makes me realize how much of a fucking scrubs the Hyuuga in general are and how awesome Neji was. Not that it matters since Kishi never made a thing about him being that great.         Toad. Sasuke doesn't know how to do sage mode at all.     You know how much chakra he had? same amount Alliance randoms after being infused with Naruto chakra.   [citation needed]     There was Sakura saying he must have taken drugs because no one could get that strong in over two years. But like you said she had no proof of that.    Tsunade says that Orochimaru experimented with Sasuke and that's why he's so powerful.    Dragon is way more broken but I don't know if Kabuto is a good example because he was really strong AND he had cools experiments on himself.        Isn't it just raw chakra? like the uninfused rasengan     Hinata achieved Twin Lion Fists, something Neji never did. Plus, at the end of the war, the databook says they're equals.    If Kishi had some ounce of talent for boosting the side characters to relevance, Neji could have learned to go at least to the 2nd of the 8 gates. Boost his speed to Kyubi Chakra mode levels or something.     Neji was the Itachi of the Hyugas.    Slug, so that he can cuck Salad out of a third parent figure.     [citation needed]  Hashirama says so Read the fucking manga or don't talk about it. i'm not going to spoonfeed you and certainly not on something that happened not so much ago      Keep in mind, though, that during this period of peace, the Cloud Village created a fucking chakra cannon that held enough power to potentially crack the moon. And they didn't think it was worth mentioning this to all the other Villages. Cloud has always been the most warlike Village, there is no way that they weren't gonna jump back on the warpath when they were up to speed again.    No it doesn't you hinatawanker.    http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Naruto<wbr>_Hiden  Here you go, anon.  They're not translated yet, but I've heard Reddit/Tumblr people are cracking onto it.    </wbr>    And he was weak compared to every monster we got in this manga.  Why are Hyuugas are shit when they should be decent enough?.     She looks like she's having a seizure at around the 18 second mark.     the power of her Byakugan is in no way inferior to Neji's     Make him a huge nerd for the shinobi world equivalent of sentai shit    Tsunade says a lot of things. The only two people who could really confirm what happened between Sasuke and Orochimaru at that point is Sasuke and Orochimaru, and they're both keeping quiet on the details.     Super Strength   This shouldn't even count. There are so many different things that let you be super strong, including just straight up lifting weights.       the power of her Byakugan is in no way inferior to Neji's   That means they're equals.   That their eye is the same doesn't mean they are you wanker, Neji is not a genius only because of his pretty eyes      Hinata a shit..TenTen 4ever!    How could the ayyliens come from the moon if Rikudofag made the moon after he shat on his mother?   I'm sure I saw a doujin about it     Tenten    Who?       Tsunade was used as an exposition character. Don't be so dense.    Last time Hashirama saw her Tsunade was a toddler. His word does not mean shit.   How long is Naruto Gaiden supposed to last? Is this just supposed to lead into the movie and then end?    What does Tsunade have to do with this? When did we start talking about her? are you stupid or just trying to bait me?      $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$<wbr>$$$</wbr>     Ten chapters, supposedly.    It's a miniseries and prologue to BORUTO: THE MOVIE. so it should end before the movie.  It's confirmed to be a miniseries in case you don't believe me, it doesn't rank in JUMP because of that.       I don't know, it's weird.  Up until now I've just assumed that Hagoromo and Hamura were equals. Since the Hyuuga are direct descendants of Hamura while the Uchiha/Senju are off-shoots branding from Hagoromo's sons, you'd expect the Hyuuga to be able to flatten the Senju/Uchiha in battle.  But it's the opposite           1 volume    Asura had the body strength of hagoromo and indra got the eyes.  Hashirama and Madara, now stop riding Sasuke's dick     inbreeding help     How long is Naruto Gaiden supposed to last?  It was just announced that the next chapter will be the last. And it's about Salad graduating the academy.  - The last chapter of Naruto Gaiden will be release in the 32th issue of WSJ  - We will get it next week (there is no scheduled break) - There will be a colour spread in this chapter   Shounen Jump Issue 32: Cover, Lead CP: Hinomaru Zumou CP: Naruto Gaiden (End), To Love-Ru Darkness (Special Chapter)              &gt;&gt;www.fanfiction.net     The fact that Hinata managed to upgrade Neji's ultimate technique means they're equals at least .       Thanks guys.   Are you implying they're going to milk it for shekels anyways?          Not liking who he is already     Asura had the body strength of hagoromo  That's what Tobi says because of how legends of Asura have passed on, but he doesn't know the full story. From Hagoromo directly we hear that Asura was the fuckup and Indra was the genius.     I like Hinata but let's be honest. The Hyuga were never meant to be important. The only reason the stuff with Hamura and Kaguya having byakugan was there was to make Hinata special for The Last.    You have to train the body, Eyes power are cheats, that all there is to it     The last chapter of Naruto Gaiden will be release in the thirty-twoth issue of WSJ   Any word on a 19 page standard issue or extended page count for the last chapter?        Were the fuck is this list of abilities from? Is it fan made?      Villain is utter shit and has no ties to Kaguya, gets decimated in 1 chapter   instead of Salad improving her relationship with her shitty dad we get 9 chapters of contrived baby momma drama that Kishi will inevitably wrap up with MISUNDERSTANDINGS   Did this gaiden's existence have any point besides $$$?       yes    Yeah and Naruto is stronger than Sasuke even when he absorbed chakra from all 8 bijuu's what you're point?    they did it for dbz, so why not?  I doubt Kishimoto can write another succesful series (just look at his mafia one shot), so he'll have to stick to milking naruto.      Why does everyone get this wrong? Hagoromo made the moon after he split the ten tails into the beasts, his mom couldn't possibly have been fearing enemies from the moon because she was dead.    Hagoromo and Hamura were equals before Hagoromo became a Jinchuuriki.  But that would be the same for the Uchiha.  The only answer is that Kishi doesn't give a fuck about the Hyuuga, argument enough is that the girl that won the MCbowl is irrelevant like most secondary characters and has probably 11-12 chapters of a 700 chapter manga where she is barely relevant.        Well he is going to get away from Naruto for awhile anyway. Even if he can't get away from milking it.  Pray his next series does decently.     Where my nigga killer bee at :(    The point is that Naruto's struggle is his own - not Indra's. He learned cooperation and love is greater strength than isolation and using others.    And look at how Hashirama fucked up Madara even with Kurama on his side, he had to get some Hashirama juice just to get on his level and decades of training    Asura people actually have to train. Eyes power corresponds to emotions, didn't you get the cheat part?    But Madara wasn't the genius, Hashirama was. It was stated several times and in the flashback we saw Hashirama being superior to Madara all the time even as kids.  Madara was the fuck up       Yeah I'll pray.   So, just to confirm:  The Yang version of Kyuubi stayed in Naruto after it was transferred via Obito (Through Minato).  What about the Yin version? Does it just hang around and sit by Konoha? I can't imagine the citizens being too fond of that.       Americans unironically like this manga and discuss it for hours on the internet    His baseball one-shot was good. I also liked Mario.      My nipples look like cherries! &lt;3      Madara was the fuck up  nice fanfiction there  when Naruto and Hashirama both learned sage-mode they're pretty much above they're counterparts already       He just fused yin yang. They were one to begin with.   Unless the Yin part died or something      Yin Kurama joined back with Yang between 699 and Last.     Nice fanfiction   Have you read the manga? Jesus christ of course you haven't because /a/ just likes to shittalk. Madara was always inferior to Hashirama, he got his ass kicked every fucking time since they were kids you fucking retard.       No really Madara being a fuck is really hilarious please continue    both of them were genius, harishima was the stronger one in the end though     Wasn't it mentioned that no human could contain both the Yang and Yin version of Kyuubi? Because of how much chakra you'd have to seal.  I guess more wank to Naruto then for being able to do so.       No, because Kushina did shortly before Kurama was sealed in Naruto. Mito did as well.    If they fuck and make kid's sweet fucking god they well be gods    Didn't you get the memo? Eyes powers corresponds the muh vengeance and by the time Madara got to that part, Hashimama already master sage arts     Europeans riot over soccer results, think paper airplanes are a danger to schoolkids, and demand legislation to ban pointy kitchen knives     honk      i thought there is a dick    _____________honk_______   honk honk  I love Honk  Honk and her boyfriend, Bueeeeh.  i will save the thread   nice try but she belongs to Nico!         how do I get my own honk   Fight me for her love.

He is Sabersexual, I even seen him getting lovey about Jeanne D'Arc so yeah.    He is clearly a really big fag, the way he types should be annoying but somehow he bypasses all of this to be a really cool fag. I think he just has really good charisma which is strange since he is a saberfag.

Has she been actually bullied in the manga?   I want to non-sexually fuck Tomoko!    Fuck off, there are thousands of girls just like Tomoko but you wouldn't look twice if you saw them irl   I want to make her a defication restricted sex stow    No, The author doesn't want to put the bullying element into manga.     I want to non sexually hug Tomoko!   I want Tomoko to sexually sit on my face   BRISBANE R I S B A N E           no, Japan.. I'm the author    I want to kiss Tomoko in the forehead, while holding her    I want to kill her butthole while she cries   i want to  dissect  tomoko   I've been meaning to actually watch this.  Some of my favourite doujins are of her.  http://g.e-hentai.org/g/676340/0f45<wbr>928fe2/</wbr>        fat white girl detected    Well none of them would want to deal with me.    Jesus, I deeply love this show but seeing those doujins made me die a little inside. It's like seeing my daughter in porn or something.   Never experienced that before. Strange. Usually i'm totally up for that stuff.      mfw cute incest doujins of moko with no digustig fetishes     Usually i'm totally up for that stuff.  Seeing your daughter in porn?       I suppose could have worded that better...   speaking of, what happened to /a/ colors tomoko?  willing to bet at least 15 of these 20 unique IPs are from beanerville fuck off beaners     No one gives a fuck about landwhales tbh, consider suicide.     mfw doujins of tomoko in an actual relationship      I want to cuddle her non-sexually.   aight    It wouldn't be so bad. I mean my cousin did porn, and seeing her get fuck by all those guys gave me a tremendous sense of pride and accomplishment, knowing I'd beaten them to it.    You did not get paid for it.    She inadvertently bullies herself.    thats lewd!   I sat next to an girl with massive anxiety at the store. She squinted whenever I tried to look at her and couldn't make eye contact. She looked like she was in pain. sigh... Too bad she was ugly.      no, thankfully. It would be even more painful to read with bullies.     You just couldn't let me have that one happy thought, could you?    Oh, hey landwhale! I don't know if you are a fujo but please consider suicide.   tomoko fuckers are worse than horse fuckers.  It it some perverted form of empathy?   That sounds like you are insinuating that you've fucked your daughter.    Back the fuck off my waifu!!    canon end     But I don't want to fuck a girl like her. I want to fuck her.     Does anyone know if they're going to make new episodes?    I want to cheer her up.    It's about the manga. It's always been about the manga.    Never, because you're just a disgusting leech who never bought the BDs and manga.    I haven't got a daughter.  I wouldn't be opposed to the idea though, once she was an adult of course.     Eat a dick, nigga      Deal with it.    Fuck you Carlos you piece of shit. You think you're so damn funny don't you.   Is the /a/ draws tomoko fag here? When will we get our youtube video?    I want to sexually gangrape Tomoko with /a/   Post a scene    I don't think what would be very good for her mental and emotional wellbeing    This I drew like half a dozen of them for him and i want to see the final product or atleast draw some more if he ever makes a new thread    If it doesn't end up getting made someone else could just take the images from the imgur folder and do it instead.   ^   Oh thats right, I forgot that the imgur folder exists. That makes things easier     Its still no excuse. The op should have stuck with his idea to the end. The lazy cunt better make a comeback soon     well, heres the album if someone else wants to give it a shot     forgot link  http://imgur.com/a/vVQMg#122     Sex for the sole purpose of procreation.    I want to spray her with a hose while I yell "CLEAN YOURSELF SLUT" and laugh at her misery.    only reference that she was called names in the past but knowing tomoko, she probably deserved it by being a bitch    Best doujin  and ship    Was it ever confirmed that President was in the dog costume or was that just an anime inference    Pls be 18 in this photograph    Just thinking that. One of those ones you want to save but decide not to because it could be taken the wrong way    it's the prez    Hate to be that guy but I couldn't find sauce on this.    No Matter How You Look At It, It’s Senpai’s Fault that I Came!    Thanks    No problem anon, I intend to make the world a brighter place by spreading the love.    So what's the deal with the President why does she care so much about Tomoko?    It's called LOVE    The author was bullied and thought it was too painful. The editor thought it was too painful that she didn't have any friends and that's why they created moeslut.      I hate you summer /a/      but in all seriousness, she's probably trying to get Tomoko to come out of her shell.   Haha.   Prez was also an introvert once so she wants to help Tomoko.    But moeslut is a terrible friend.    3/4 of tomoko doujins I've seen involve scat or make her look bony to the point of seeing her ribcage   please make it stop     That's just the artist's way of showing she's messy and doesn't take good care of herself    ^this    I think the threads ended and OP is making the video. Which sucks because I finished my OC too late.   Nevar forget.   where would you take tomoko in the first date?    Behind a dumpster in an alleyway     Just like Tomoko   Fat   No      Would Tomoko do anal?  I wanna bully Tomoko  until she commits suicide      I wanna give Tomoko and make over and a haircut   [spoilerI wanna impregnante tomoko and leave her to raise my halfbreed[/spoiler]    Yeah because any authority that gives a shit about this sort of thing is going to give a shit about the supposed age.      I love 'em.     The arcade or an anime movie. Dont have to talk much and its something she would be comfortable doing    LONDON PLS O N D O N  P L S                you will never spend a pleasant, romantic afternoon with Tomoko  http://pastebin.com/mzWR1Wqe     The last line was really the only thing anybody needed.    one fucking job anon    Yes she was. I don't have the screen cap but it's an earlier chapter. She has a flash back when her friend asked her "Did you have any nicknames in middle school?" Tomoko thinks about it for a bit and you see names like, "Bitch!" and "Moron!" and other stuff like that. She was bullied in the past, but not actively in the comic.      If she was bullied then the manga would be better.    Fucking doujinshits. Watch the goddamn anime at least, then read the manga.     this picture makes me sad    I'd never even heard of it before I saw that doujin by chance. It wasn't a conscious decision to look for porn before watching the show.  But I have it now and will be reading/watching.        Yeah it's pretty poorly drawn.      But what if i have a sexual fetish for purely procreative sex?   Just imagine  being Tomoko's class mate and dragging her behind the bicycle shed before school, making her expect just a kind word or a kiss on the cheek, but instead pulling down her panties, getting your dick out, and fucking her raw against the wall.   Just imagine,  a little later in class, watching her looking at you over her shoulder, giving you a grateful smile, reaching down her skirt, then showing you her index finger, which is dripping wet with your cum.   Just imagine  watching her sticking out her tongue and giving her finger a long, slow, lustful lick.   Just imagine that.         Well, that's alright I guess. Now that you've essentially fucked her you can at least take her to dinner.  A lot of doujins fail to portray Tomoko's bitchy side, which has been especially prevalent in the recent chapters since she's had to deal with interacting with others for a prolonged period of time. Most of them only portray her spaghetti-dropper side. You might find it surprising, some people hate it, I think it makes her a more interesting character.       sticking your dick in a pile of shit     but what if    From behind.      are you fat?    Disgusting, that isn't cute at all.    are you fucking kidding me    Why do I remember this copypasta? It isn't even that good.    bravo, sasuga lies desu    As if she wouldn't be into it, if you weren't all fat slobs.    Wow I came back to the thread just at the same time you replied     tfw you realize tomokos problems and inadequacies are the perfect feeding ground for bullshit feminist agendas   you have to admit, she would be a tumblrina if she was real      please refer to    this is still my favorite series this decade    90% of the readerbase are males who can relate, idk if it could stand as only relevant to females.      Non-H?      get out    Well, men typically are more inclined to actually do shit and work out there problems, instead of waiting for their savior to swoop in and get them out of their misery(as opposed to women). So I'd say Tomoko's failures to actually get anything done in terms of improving her situation and her constant daydreaming should make her very much relatable to women.    either this is a high quality bait, or you are an imbecile     Well, men typically are more inclined to actually do shit and work out there problems   I do not think this is even slightly true to be honest.      HERE LIES TOMOKO SHE NEVER SCORED     What about that page when she remind how her classmaters tell her lots of bad things? Someone post it.    Tomoko was never bullied, she was an asshole to people who were being nice to her.     I want to sexually fuck Tomoko!  How else would you?    Will Tomoko and Komisan ever become friends?   What I think is that it remind of herself, pres at some point maybe was like Tomoko, so she want to show her that things can get better, that part of the hug was really sweet and what Tomoko really need at that moment.    Without pleasure, merely to establish dominance.    Nobody is interested in a landwhale.     Without pleasure, merely to establish dominance  So don't feel anything and show her you're the boss? Won't her accepting your dominance and submitting cause pleasure to you?      Won't her accepting your dominance and submitting cause pleasure to you?  No. Would you feel joy from an ant's submission? It is the way of nature. There is no pleasure to it.     I knew a girl like Tomoko, she hated me, for no reason, she was also kinda cute.     she hated me, for no reason  I'm sure being a fat fuck with no social skills and a pungent odor is enough reason, anon.      Pungent odor  Everything was exact apart from that.      No. Would you feel joy from an ant's submission? It is the way of nature. There is no pleasure to it.  Now I get it.     You can't really smell your own brand. Search your feelings, you know it to be true.     You can't really smell your own brand  Yes you can, also I never had a pungent odor.       That's because I don't leave my room and neither do they.    They have such a strange relationship. When they were on the plane I almost thought they were gonna hold hands, then in the recent chapter Tomoko ran away to another group as soon as she saw Komi's.   At least at this point Komi doesn't really seem to hate Tomoko anymore, she's just curious about her autism.      3DPD isn't 2d you degenerate    because they wouldn't be seen irl, implying a girl like tomoko would ever go outside    Quirky withdrawn girls are not purposely overlooked.  No one notices them because they do not try to be seen, save for the time Tomoko squished the cockroach.     she probs smells, that's why she has no friends    she probs smells  Like generic soap and hair conditioner maybe.  Fan mistranslation meme should be laid to rest.       Well duh, they're 3D. Even gross losers are adorable and sexy in 2D.   How does it make you feel that Tomoko is currently turning into a prosocial person with leadership qualities?   I'm glad. It's making Komi jealous and interested in her.     I hope she fucks her brother.    I want to passive-aggressively walk her home          I want to aggressively fuck Tomoko's feet.   I want to gently  walk her home.    Ok   Reminder that if you want to sexually fuck Tomoko she's only 140 cm tall and would sweat through all her clothes before you even got into close proximity.   Smaller the better m8    Fucking good. I want her nice and slippery when i'm wrecking that quarter sized hole.     mfw it's true      watashit     This guy here gets it.     quarter sized    More like dime      You're too harsh. It's like a peso    If I try to rape Tomoko you think she would resist?    If I try to rape Tomoko you think she would resist?  It could go either way or it won't be rape as she would probably consent to that.     Yes    You're probably fat, smelly and unattractive, so yes. Even she has standards.    Maybe   omoshiroi      Yaa, gomen gomen!        TADIMA     Gashunk!   HANASE!  M-MASAKA!    D-Dame.   TEME KONO YARO   HAYAI!  BAKANA!   every time   BAKA HENTAI!   fuck spiders   Tuskete!

Why don't you just leave it do its own thing. Eat some fucking plants, shit a lot. What the fuck man.    Is that Serena Williams?   To sell the tusks.    this one is just sad     Why would you ever kill an elephant.  sometimes they get to close to villages and destroy their crops or its for their ivory     gotta gi me som ivory mayne.   Ittekimaaasu!  K-kaa-san, Yamete kudasai.      That's depressing.  Fuck       this was the saddest shit ever in this movie    what the fuck's wrong with it?    Chinks will pay out the ass for magic dick tusk magic pills.  And y'know, elephants do have a nasty habit of stomping on farmland and eating villagers crops.      yes  no      food and safety bull elephants regularly kill people and destroy crops     j-just run pleeease    fuck you    never gets old    This. Chinks pay a fucking huge amount of money for this shit. Same goes for turtles from Madagascar.    Lion cub broke its back while hunting with its mom. Lioness left it to die.    I'm Crimean rivers here.    Somehow I didn't find it as bad as that sloth program they advertised with "babies getting pajamas! So cute!"  The weaker baby dies and then the second one refuses to eat or move and dies. Sloths just fucking give up. Like there's a video on youtube of a cougar chasing a sloth and the sloth just closes its eyes in pain and lets go.

He decides he hasn't been living his life the way he truly wants to and breaks from Haruno and his family to go his own way, committing himself to be sincere for once.

Sword armor pic for the delusions, coke because that was his favorite drink?       Anime that isn't adapting anything    People still use the term "filler episode"   Why?     because the episode isn't contributing to the overall plot  like onsen or beach episodes     If the anime has a plot, then suddenly episodes are filled with meaningless actions, its considered filler.   Does Lum count as yandere?  Also why doesn't Ataru just politely ask her to stop electrocuting him when she "displays her love"?     She'll stop when he stops hitting on other girls.   Never.      I don't think so. Jealous as she can get, she's not deranged. She's on good terms with most of the other female characters as well.  I'd say the closest thing to a yandere in the series is actually Lum's friend, Ran. She will actually try to eliminate people getting in-between her and Rei.    Maybe really early on when she's fangier and trying to murder Shinobu.  They're displays of affection, that would be like leaning in for a kiss and being refused. She'd cry, he'd feel like a heel, then she'd fry him anyway out of anger.    Yangire.   I don't recall her trying to outright murder Shinobu. Just doing shit like monitoring his phone calls, refusing to let him see Shinobu, locking him in the house, following him, etc.   Actually, that all still sounds pretty bad.      Ran is the yandere.  Lum is deredere.     What about that episode where Ataru tries to end the triangle by picking Shinobu and she tries to murder him so they can have a lover's suicide?   Is Urusei Yatsura literally Cuck: The Anime?   I think that may have been in the very same episode I was talking about, but I forget which one it is specifically.    No.    No more than every Takahashi show with thirty intersecting love triangles.     implying ataru won't still chase other girls    The whole reason Lum is in the show is because she cucked Shinobu, while also cucking Rei, then Ataru continued to cuck Lum.  No RT show was so heavily based on NTR.         Shit, you might be on to something. Everything is second loves in UY, the cucks-per-minute might be much higher than is first apparent.    No.    Honestly, I just look at it like this. They're normal teenagers for the most part. They're going to fall in out and out of love a lot of times before settling. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.   I really wish /tv/ had not cracked open a dictionary and learned a funny new word.       I thought it was /pol/    I'm going to be perfectly honest with you: I don't understand what you mean when you use the word 'cuck' here.    Probably. They have a tendency to weed themselves into other boards.    That's because it's not the right word to use anyway.    That's when Lum was supposed to be a one off alien bitch. In the first few manga chapters, Lum was supposed to be gone by chapter two. But due to her popularity, she was brought back as the 'antagonist'. Then more people liked her, and Rumiko made Lum the focus and softened her features. Early Lum had more visible fangs, makeup, and openly tried to kill people. She was cruel to all other women. But when Lum became a fan favorite, she became Shinobu's best female friend.     The original idea for Urusei Yatsura was to have a new alien every chapter.    Between Lum's introduction and her absence in chapter two with the taxi driving alien, Lum gained a following.   this following was parodied in the manga chapter 3, creating the Lum storm troopers.    Lum never cucked Shinobu. Shinobu openly hated Ataru and didn't really want to marry him. She only 'fought' for Ataru cause she thought Lum was a whore. She instantly forgot Moroboshi's existence when Mendou came. Now go back to /tv/ with that cuck bullshit.         She doest hate him, she had to give up because she knew she couldn't win.    Reminder that Rumiko wanted Shinobu to win, therefore it's canon.    If she wanted that, why'd she change it to Lum? If anything, Rumiko fucked Shinobu over.  Well, she can't win against Lum.   Let's give her Mendou.   Lol nope.   She gets the furfag.         What are you talking about? Ataru and Shinobu were clearly in a relationship in episode 1.    They were dating.    Because the publishers demanded it. Do your research, everyone knows this.     Should have made Shinobu better than lum then, instead of having her be so boring.     Then it's not canon anymore. Since Lum won. Here's proof.   That's dating? Threatening to kill Ataru and force him to play tag by offering her hand in marriage is dating?      At least Shinobu didn't go dangerously cheesy.    At least Rumiko didn't make her fall for the fucking lip monster that chases her.    Should have been three boys like in the anime.    That's a pattern of breakups and reconciliations that's lasted ten years. Whatever else Ataru and Shinobu were, they'd also been friends since preschool.    Why don't more anime couples have sons?  I swear to fucking god, every single one that's ever existed has only ever had one daughter.      Because despite what faggots might say little girls are cute than little boys.     Lum was supposed to be gone by chapter two.  Oh fuck, really? Lum is easily the most well known character and liked from the series. I can't even imagine it without her.     Not the point.    Every otaku would rather have a daughteru than a son and otaku are the target audience. Better?    Not every single person that reads and buys these type of manga self inserts friend, or is so similar that they would all want the same thing despite what you've read on /a/    I think Lum won too, but that's fanart.    Well yes, I didn't mean to speak for everyone just saying that there are numerous daughteru threads and no son threads, whatever the fuck you wanna call it they didn't even invent a word for it because the demand does not exist.      otaku are the target audience   Urusei Yatsura was from before otaku ruined anime forever.      I seriously hope you aren't basing your opinions solely on what you see on /a/   Seperate thread for this Son/Daughter business:    I'm genuinely curious though. Is there a single example besides the TV version of Urusei Yatsura?        Urusei Yatsura was from before otaku ruined anime forever.  I don't think you're completely aware of what you're saying.     I am perfectly aware of what I said. I was just being facetious.  Urusei Yatsura was made by otaku.        Mendou is like Ataru except with money, looks, and crippling phobias.    To be honest, I wish Shinobu had ended up with  Ryuunosuke.     I wouldn't think so.    I don't think her dislike of him really came out in full force until after she decided to pursue Mendou instead.  But it's impossible to forget Ataru because he won't fuck off no matter how many times you tell him no or crush him with desks.      The only thing she dislikes about him is his fickle and flirtatious ways, she still wants to be friends with him but not date him because he has Lum now. She only hits him because he comes trying to flirt when he's in a relation ship.     Good thing people smarter then her were in charge of that decision.     Then even later after everybody's character is really nailed down she's still employing mind-control and blackmail, everything she tries to feed him is toxic, she's just fucking delighted if he's injured on her behalf, okay you know what maybe. It's not yan on the order of wanting to wear his skin, but still.   I thought this was suppose to be a comedy.  ;_;   I love Lum but Ataru is the true reason UY is so great.   I can agree on that.  Honestly, I like that Ataru, Lum, Shinobu, and Mendou can all be really vicious to each other but still do a lot of stuff together as friends.      It's okay anon. She got her wish in the end.    She wants him to openly admit he loves her which he is adamant about not doing when she asks because he thinks it wouldn't be genuine, he does show he loves her though as times like in your pic when he takes the punch instead of letting her get hit. He's almost fucking invincible though so people hardly worry about him actually injuring himself. She has been shown to be pretty absent minded so many of her schemes start off with the best of intentions then go badly and it's also why she tries feeding him stuff that are enjoyable to aliens but bad for humans. He actively tries to flirt with other women though so it's not like he doesn't have it coming when she tries to get him to do the same with her when they both know they love each other, so she's not yandere unless every girl in the series is also the yandere because they all act the same when the one they love flirts with another.    Lum is such a qt3.14   Why does this show have better animation than anything Trigger's ever done despite being 35 years old?   Because Trigger is shit.  Actually, Little Witch Academia looks pretty good. Although it'd probably look a lot worse if it had been a TV series.       That ending was pretty cute but when put side by side with Urusei Yatsura's first opening, I can't help but get irritated by how little movement there is in it.   Why are Urusei Yatsura OPs and EDs so based?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5<wbr>gi9PH7j0</wbr>  [ ] https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ifn<wbr>oD0tCzD8</wbr>  [ ]     Still the best girl.    They were up until "rock the planet!"     On the subject of Lum's cooking, she doesn't really seem to understand that not everybody has the palate for spicy foods. That and Ataru is a dick about it which just encourages her to make more.   Fucking fight me.        That 80s rock guitar riff is so bad.     That's not a girl, that's a woman.    I love the 80s rock guitar riff though.     He's almost fucking invincible though so people hardly worry about him actually injuring himself.   Reminds of when everyone rushed outside to see if his arm was actually broken. The notion of Moroboshi even breaking a bone is cause for alarm.   Good god was it QUALITY though.         The more I think about it the more I'm impressed that a single character gained so much popularity within a matter of weeks.   Yeah. It's pretty obvious in hindsight, given that she was entirely absent from the second chapter. It was pretty awful too IMO.      LUM BUM!   More like no bum.      Ran's reaction to hysterical crying that he's been killed is pretty much "Impossible. Calm down."   Who was best tan?   That's just how life is. Even the ups have to pass eventually because life goes &gt;pic related    Newcomer VA ruins series they debut in, goes on to become massively successful, never look back again.
