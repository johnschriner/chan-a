[ So anon, is this worth a read?<br>Apparently its not done, is it nearing completion?</br>  its good, don't expect it to finish or have a good ending  <br>It's hiatus time</br>  USE FUCKING GOOGLE.  <br>Is very good, too much glorification and ultra high romanticized view on the samurai era though. Still, is good enough for you to look past that. <br><br>Ending will be good if you like Mushashi and dislike Koshiro.<br><br>Must give the mangaka a pat on his back for not making the farming arc pretentious as Vinland Saga, jesus was the shit pretentious as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's an adaptation of a novel that was pretty good, and the art is great, so yes, it is worth a read.</br>  <br> pretentious <br>Explain further.</br></br>  <br>That word gets misused time and time again.</br>  <br>That pic is so small, we can hardly see what a handsome bastard Musashi is.</br>  <br> pretentious as fuck <br><br>Jesus christ, how stupid do you have to be to find it pretentious? Nothing the characters did was close to being an affectation embodying some super deep philosophy. It was literally Thorfinn being depressed as fuck because he lost his purpose in life and wanting to do something more than senseless killing for once in his life. I can understand not liking it, or finding it boring, but it was as far from being pretentious as you can get.</br></br></br>  <br>Shoving down ideals that would never work in the world that have been shown so far in the fiction, yet for that moment, is the magical solution. <br><br>And the result, the "feels" feel fake. But of course, it was directed for the mainstream Naruto audience, so majority buys it.<br><br>Well, now I´m sounding pretentious as hell for even explaining it.<br><br>tl;dr:<br>The answer for stopping the bloodshed is dumb, and I´m not buying it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that would never work in the world that have been shown so far in the fiction <br>Yes, and some fools even believe than one day man will fly! Pish-posh!</br></br>  Wouldn't it be nice to have a worthy opponent?  <br>If you start, just remember when it stops that's it.. don't get your hopes up or dwell when it will finish.. it wont</br>  <br>There's always the book.</br>  <br> not making the farming arc pretentious as Vinland Saga <br>I disagree. In fact, I could have agreed with you entirely barring this fact.</br></br>  <br>Alright, so retard confirmed. Learn what the word pretentious means next time, dumbass. And congrats on completely missing the central conflict of the story. You are the naruto audience, as you've completely failed to understand the story.</br>  <br>But it's just a comic book about carrying longboats and killing people, there's nothing to understand!</br>  <br>Second only to Berserk in its genre. Definitely worth checking out. Like Berserk however, it will never be finished.</br>  <br> second only to Berserk in its genre <br>Hmm.</br></br>  <br> genre <br><br>You don't know what that word means, do you?</br></br></br>  <br>I like Vagabond more but the farming arc in Vagabond is way more pretentious than the one in Vinland Saga, even if it was shorter.</br>  <br>Epic philosophical action Seinin genre.</br>  <br> Berserk <br> philosophical </br></br>  <br> joke <br> your head </br></br>  <br>Well it does have that intro in the anime where it says something about free will.</br>  fuck vagabond, I want him to work on REAL  <br>Even having been told there is a joke, I'm still missing it. Explain.</br>  <br>He's pretending to be the original dumb poster who thought Berserk and Vagabond are the same genre.</br>  <br>I concur. Real is too fucking good.</br>  It starts rather awkwardly as a 6/10 manga and then it steadily climbs to 7/10 and 8/10 and 9/10 and eventually a solid 10/10 during the peak of the action but it's followed by a period of peace and it's steadily declining over time. The character progression is good and he feels a lot mature and philosophical but it also means that there is less action, there is less travel, there is less suspense, the main character hardly fights anyone, and if you previously liked the manga for all these things then you're going to feel blueballed.<br><br>Still worth checking out I'd say.</br></br>  Is there anyone else here who has read both the manga and the original novel? Because I think that sometimes when they differed, the manga actually turned out better.  <br><br>nice art but I found the main character and antagonist boring, the side characters used for nothing but brief unfunny comedy relief scenes lame and the fights with random nobodies a chore to get through. <br><br><br>read Shigurui instead op. it has disabled swordsmen that aren't as big of faggots as kojiro.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't say whether Shigurui is better than Vagabond but I can definitely say that anyone interested in a good samurai mango should check out both. They're the best of the genre.</br>  <br><br> Shigurui </br></br>  <br><br>Shigurui is fucking great. It's the first time I've gasped due to the outcome of a fight.<br>It's a shame the whole thing wasn't made as an anime.</br></br></br>  <br>It also made me cringe when people got hurt.</br>  <br>Shigurui has an anime adaptation which is still very good.</br>  For some reason I could only read this while drinking heavly, whisky preferred.<br>Never made it past after the fight with staff-kun in the woods and MC reaches some town with a dojo or something, I dont know, its been a while.<br><br>Did I stop before this so called "peak" or does it continue in its rather slow manner that builds up the good points?</br></br></br>  I'm the only one that liked the Farm arc the most out of the entire manga?  <br>I know.</br>  <br>no, vagabond is literally the most cliche and shonen structured samurai manga i know of (second to ruroni kenshin). its bad, read zamurai or something else. there are so many better samurai mangas.<br><br>i mean, vagabond was alright for a while. but it does fall apart quick when you get to the deaf guy.</br></br></br>  wonder where he got his inspiration from  <br>Second that. The best part begins once Musashi can't fight as good as he used too anymore.</br>  <br>:^)</br>  <br>to*</br>  I pray and hope everyday for ricefarmingsaga to continue  <br>naruto fangirl here, and i do like vinland because thorfinn reminds me of naruto. so dont shit on us narutofags.</br>  <br>You having a giggle there?</br>    <br> Musashi refusing the other Samurai's proposal of glory so that he can help a bunch of peasants <br> Despite the fact he's growing weaker every day, he's improving as a person and learning to understand other people and his surroundings. <br> That amount of despair when despite his efforts everything just goes wrong over and over again. <br> Old man becomming a total bro in the end and helping everybody out <br> Mushashi, who is now a walking hungry skeleton begging on his knees to the other samurai and making a deal with them so that they help that infertile land and help his friends/comrades <br><br>Pinnacle of the manga right there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want REAL to genre shift into wrasslin' instead of cripple basketball.</br>  <br> refusing <br>casca is disgusting used goods. i rather read hitman reborn.</br></br>  <br>The artist probably would die before he can finish his remaining works.</br>  <br>Pro wrestling in manga? Let's not be silly.</br>  <br>I hate both, but the farming arc in Vagabond were better written. <br><br>Mush growth in mind was realistic, growth takes time, and it doesn´t happen instantly. In Vinland it was almost comedic. I would even put it on par with Canute´s sudden personality change.<br><br>Using k-drama as milestone growth is bad writing. Hence, Vinland is worse. But I hate both, just not a fan of period pieces that´s more fiction than history.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck real, the mc is a doucebag without any redeeming traits. i want a follow up to slam dunk instead.</br>  <br>K-drama?</br>  <br>Shigurui was trying to be way to edgy, is like the mangaka learned the art of emo cutting.</br>  <br>Google?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>if youre in china, just use yahoo.</br>  Matahachi did nothing wrong.  <br>Most sympathetic character.</br>  <br>I think most people understood that its korean drama or so i would suspect, but who the fuck watches that shit to know what you mean by it.<br>Christ nigger.</br></br>  <br>Unless Inoue decides to continue into Musashi's later years, it will end like the movie and the book do: he gets on board the boat leaving Ganryu Island, gets vaguely sad, the boat sails off to the sunset, THE END.<br><br><br> too much glorification and ultra high romanticized view on the samurai era though. <br>It's pretty realistic actually. The samurai who don't give a shit about fighting are not a part of the story in the first place, and for the rest it was pretty much like what is shown in the manga, a wide spectrum of characters ranging from old masters who have awakened to petty murderers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do go autistic on me know. If you already know what Korean drama is, you know what was implied.</br>  <br>I have no idea what was implied, I've never seen a single Korean drama and don't know how it relates to Vinland Saga.</br>  <br>I really dont, but whatever.<br>If this is your idea of "no spoonfeeding" keep at it.</br></br>  <br>Canute's change was sudden, but Thorfinn's change was not. There was a whole year when he went mindbroken and just did hard labour so he didn't need to think about anything, and then we got Einar's arrival, budding of friendship, and then after another year (or was it 2?) of working on the farm, Thorfinn realizes his new goal in life (vinland) only through the subplot of that slave woman and her husband. I'm hardly seeing any dramatic change in Thorfinn's character throughout. It was not a case of him being depressed one day, and the next day being motivated about not using violence for no reason.</br>  <br>Nah, it panders way too much to glorious nippongo. Reading it make you want to live in that era. Shigarui would be a better representation of the sword era, dishonorable, shitty, and inglorious.</br>  <br>Reading Vagabond didn't make me want to live in that era. People get killed left and right with hardly any consequences to the killers. It's a scary time.</br>  <br><br>Tetsuya Sariwatari, writer of Tough, has started writing a wrasslin' manga if I'm not mistaken.</br></br>  <br> Tough <br>I've been meaning to pick that up, but it's so long and I don't know if I can stick to a fighting series for that long. How good is it?</br></br>  <br> edgy <br><br>there's that buzzword again.<br><br>"edginess" aside the relationship and rivalry between Gennosuke and Seigen was far more interesting to me than anything in vagabond.<br><br>I also liked how the creator didn't have a romantic view of that era or the samurai class. these where violent cunts looking out for their best interest in order to rise in their shit heap of a society.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The supposed edginess of Shigurui comes from the fact that the series is unnecessarily brutal, just like the time period it depicts.</br>  <br>Do not take that literally and go full retard. It is more in the line of: Damn, this is beautiful, such a romantic age, sword, manliness, and rice growing. I would like to experience that, of course with plot armor and not getting hunted down by forest bandits for a day. And then you realize how comfy you are on that room of yours with PC and Internet.</br>  <br> It is more in the line of <br>Dude, don't go taking your personal experience and pretending everyone else shares it.</br></br>  <br>I could see yaoi doujins of them if they wasnt drawn by somebody that couldnt draw.</br>  <br>HA! no</br>  <br>Then what is worth reading? Don't be shy anon.</br>  <br>When will you learn that people do not have to put IMO after every sentence to get that across. Is the Internet lad.</br>  <br>bleach is quite good, lol, only shonen manga i like, or read gantz, that is very bloody and good.</br>  <br>Shigurui goes to extreme of complete anti-glorification and does it on purpose. It has partly true elements but its whole cannot be taken as being realistic or accurate by anyone.<br>I agree with . The time frame presented in Vagabond isn't appealing.<br><br>Compared to Shigurui, the movie Sword of Doom (partial adaptation of the novel 大菩薩峠, "Great Bodhisattva Pass") is a more accurate representation of the times (just before the Meiji era) from the point of view of a sociopath samurai.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I've only read part of Tough myself, I've been meaning to continue but other backlog priorities arose. It's pretty bizarre and not a very conventional fighting series, I remember: Bloodsport+Mortal Kombat-esque underground tournaments, mafia everywhere, borderline supernatural powers, some guys building up power and energy via sexual deprivation, strong and righteous MC who uses a super secret assassination art but doesn't kill people, some guy linked to his past because of his father, or something.<br>As for the author's other works, Dog Soldier is like dog shit, the Tough spinoff-prequel OTON is pretty good, and Igyoujin Oniwakamaru is great.<br><br>So yeah maybe give it a go and you'll see pretty quickly whether you like it or not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Both of youre wrong. Both Vag and Shi are unrealistic. One head to the extreme of showing the brutalization and ugliness of being a samurai. And the other one indulge in your desire of a romantic era. Men with dreams and ideals. <br><br>However, both should be read. As theres much enjoyment and learning to be had. Everyone should just put down their fucking fan flags.</br></br></br>  <br>After your description, I think I'll pass. I prefer martial arts stuff to be like Holyland.</br>  <br>shit taste confirmed.</br>  <br>is okay at first, then turns very very very bad with evil uncle and the fights become a super power fights.</br>  <br>Compare, though: Shigurui doesn't show a single good thing about samurai life and the samurai, while Vagabond showed many bad aspects of them even if it doesn't focus on that.</br>  So how useful is dual wielding for real?  <br>Not very unless you can actually overpower someone with one hand.</br>  <br>Did the real Musashi ever actually dual wield? I know for a fact that he would utilize his short sword if he lost his primary weapon but I don't know if he ever used them at the same time as he's commonly depicted doing.</br>  <br> not useful until you got what it takes to utilize it. like every thing ever. <br>geez, do you moonlight as sherlock?</br></br>  <br>It's more than just skill or practice. That's like herculean strength.</br>  <br>Niten Ichi-ryu, he used his second sword as a parry tool. So yes.</br>  <br>never go full retard. you are assuming he is wielding a bastard sword on both hands or what? have you ever wielded a short sword? they are quite light and can be used to swing with one hand. dualwielding can be useful. throwing your other sword or use it to block.</br>  <br>Confirmed for being scrawny.</br>  <br>Absolutely. When I picked it up I couldn't put it down. Thank God there was 300+ chapters when I started.</br>  <br>Another thing is, Musashi did not take a vow to not kill or pick up the sword again like Thorfinn did. He just simply doesn't want to murder everyone who goes against him, like when his leg was injured and drew the circles when he was recognized as was challenged, yet all small fries stepped in.</br>  I want it to finish so I could reread or own it. I mean fuck I read it years ago and it was fantastic, but now can barely remember the events.  <br>yup yup. vagabond is the better one.</br>  Fuck yeah it's worth a read and when you're done with that read Vinland Saga.  <br>The Book of Five Rings states that it's superior but only after years of dedication. You should be able to wield the long sword with one hand as if you were wielding it with two.</br>  <br>Like I said, you don't have to like Thorfinn's extreme stance, which is obviously in its early stage and is obviously going to be developed throughout the story since there ARE going to be people who want to kill him. It doesn't make it pretentious though.</br>  <br>I didn't say I don't like it, or that I find it pretentious. I just pointed a major difference out.</br>  <br>Then why on earth are you quoting me? My original post was entirely about disputing the claim that vinland saga is pretentious. I never said one thing about Vagabond.</br>  <br>Excuse me, I didn't think getting quoted on an anonymous image board would actually offend somebody.</br>  <br>Not that guy quoting you. But I have to say it. A tad pretentious, is what the Thor moment was. Would make sense if the king guy got touched by it but would not admit it. And maybe cut of one his fingers or something. They instead become buddy buddy. And now that is how they will solve conflicts from now on. Suspension of disbelief works no longer after that.</br>  <br>Again, I'm going to have to say people really need to learn what pretentious means before they use it. What you describe is the problem of realism or believablity, hence your lack of suspense of disbelief after that.<br><br>A pretentious story has nothing to do with whether or not it's believable. It means that the story's theme is pretending to be much deeper or important than it is. A good example would be if a character namedrops famous philosophers, but those philosophers nor their ideas have any relation to the story nor its themes.</br></br></br>  <br>To continue, another example of pretentiousness is to use overly convoluted metaphors, symbols, or allusions so that the author can confuse the reader into thinking that there is lots of depth in his story when there is not.<br><br>When Thor states that a warrior needs no sword, he is stating directly. He's not hiding it in fancy words, nor is Yukimura drawing confusing symbols or whatnot. It's communicated to the audience in a very direct way. That's the opposite of being pretentious.</br></br></br>  <br>But it is pretending to be deep.<br>"Killing is not the answer, violence will never solve anything". The writer is trying to shove some idealistic bs down the readers throat. Now if it turned out that something like that would not work, then okay. But the writer is telling us that the solution is that simple. That is pretentious bs.<br><br>Why are you so triggered? There are people that actually stopped liking for that crap. And not for "hurr durr no more blood and gore".</br></br></br></br>  <br> if it turned out that something like that would not work <br>And I'm 100% sure it will not work.</br></br>  <br>I'm only triggered because people like you literally have no idea what pretentious is, yet continue to use it. Perhaps excusable if english is your 2nd or 3rd language, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.<br><br>Again, the message is not pretending to be deep in any way. Pretentiousness is concerned with the delivery of a message, not the content of its message. Its simply what it is. A stance advocating pacificsm. Its no more or no less pretentious than saying something like "violence is appropriate in certain circumstances."<br><br> the writer is telling us that the solution is that simple <br><br>Except we see directly IN THE STORY, that the solution is NOT that simple. Thorfinn's belief in pacifism is being continually challenged. And even if he himself doesn't pick up a sword, he can't make other people stop fighting either. He couldn't prevent Arneis's death nor her from utterly losing hope in the world. He can't do anything about the baby's family because he knows that blood feuds are an integral part of viking culture. It's like you completely missed every plot development in the story.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> vinland <br> pretensious </br></br>  Viking mead&gt;sake  <br>Now that is pretentious.<br><br>I would understand if you all argued about a good manga instead of this below average shounen stuff (Shuukan Shounen Magazine). And Vagabond is okay I guess. Read Blade of Immortal instead.</br></br></br>  <br>Dark Guiness&gt;Apple Cider&gt;Rice Sake&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Beer&gt;Viking Mead<br><br>Objective fact, Scandinavian true blood.</br></br></br>  <br> not a single piece of argument offered <br><br>Right, go on and keep misusing the word pretentious like a retard. As they say, ignorance is bliss, or is even that phrase too "pretentious" for you?</br></br></br>  So what have YOU been doing with your life?  <br> guy trying to correct another guy but instead turned into that guy. <br><br>the gaze as abyss thing seems to be true.</br></br></br>  <br>Blade of the Immortal is pretty cool guy, eh?</br>  Sorry drinker-kun, got the wrong post<br><br><br> guy trying to correct another guy but instead turned into that guy. <br><br>the gaze as abyss thing seems to be true.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, it's truly and utterly worthless arguing with idiots. I don't know why I bothered to begin with.</br>  <br>Indeed. So glad is not trying to be like Vagabond, Shigurui and Vinland Saga.</br>  <br> this fucking guy </br>  <br>Not useful. I can confirm, I'm a master swordsman.</br>  <br>Whittling your own bones to use as a weapon was way edgier than anything that ever happened in any of the three you mentioned though.</br>  <br>What's your name, kid?</br>  <br> I've no name to give... a man of your skill... <br>SO HARDBOILED!</br></br>  <br>I am now afraid to read it, because of you.<br><br>Is it his shit taste or is it also good?</br></br></br>  <br>It's not bad at all. It's just silly. I mean it's about a guy who can't be killed because he's full of worms that fix him up, like Fry in that one episode.</br>  <br>Masturbating.</br>  <br>How many times a day do you do it?</br>  <br> Sasaki Kojiro </br>  <br>Too many Kojiros.</br>  <br>I agree with this guy. It's funny how a you faggots are so averse to manga that tries to deliver a message contrary to your beliefs. Muh pretentiousness!</br>  <br>8</br>  <br>Waiting for more chapters of Vagabond.</br>  <br>I wish had the appropriate cap from Starless handy for this one.</br>  <br> Everyday until we like it </br>  <br> I agree with this guy. It's funny how a you faggots are so averse to manga that tries to deliver a message contrary to your beliefs. Muh pretentiousness! <br><br>as long as the message is interesting/original/new/ or done well is all good. after that one idiotic one chapter where thofin get punched without getting crippled i dropped it hard.</br></br></br>  <br> dropping a manga because of the manliest thing since forever <br>Wow.</br></br>  <br>All creatures are made to compete, pacifism is a defense mechanism concocted in the minds of the weak.</br>    <br>Competing does not equal murdering everybody and chasing some vague concept of honor.</br>  <br>B-but muh culturally mandated honor killings!</br>  <br>So many spooks in one post that it became terrifying.</br>  <br><br>I was going to give it a read. nvm, looks like the mc is a beta faggot.</br></br>  <br> pacifism is a defense mechanism concocted in the minds of the weak. <br><br>You have no fucking idea what you are talking about if you actually believe this. Competition and pacifism are both necessary for the continued existence of the human species.</br></br></br>  <br>All living creatures want to garner resources and procreate, this is the essence of living and every feeling and thought stems from this place.<br>Thorfinn is very good at fighting and he is an idiot for not taking advantage of that.<br><br><br>He doesn't become the main character until a fair while in. It's very good up until that point, would recommend reading it then dropping it like Thorfinn clearly was a child repeatedly</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> risking your life for others and being a martyr is a way of a beta faggot. </br>  <br>I think you might have stumbled upon the best definition of a beta there is, well done.</br>  <br> every feeling and thought stems from this place <br>This is a blatant reductionism. Even some apes are not that simple.</br></br>  <br>now I know why people mention naruto in this thread. even more reason to not touch it with a billion mile long stick.</br>  <br>Every creature is that simple</br>  <br> All living creatures want to garner resources and procreate <br>No. But humans have the will to realize this simple fact and go against their instincts.</br></br>  <br>Even in viking society there was a balance to be maintained, a culture with a hierarchy too strongly defined by individual martial strength will underdevelop in many other ways. Thus it benefits all of humans in a society with a certain degree of pacifism so both strong and weak can enjoy comforts.<br><br><br>This sounds an awful lot like overcompensating, "resources and procreation" is a simply asinine oversimplification of human drive. Humans are herd animals and thus VERY much have the mental mechanisms to facilitate good cooperation within the group, e.g. empathy, inhibitions against beating/killing senselessly.<br><br>Come on, really? Altruism==nardo?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Is it the time to post hat pictures?</br></br>  This is no longer about vagabond. Everything have turned into layman-tier sophistry. Unsightly seeing a bunch of teens acting like something more.  <br>One fucking post was enough to derail the thread completely. It's marvelous.</br>  <br>I'm not sure how this "X is naruto, t. edgelord" troll is still successful, shit's been around forever.</br>  <br>That is not what I'm talking about. I meant the "thank god it's not as pretentious as Vinland"-post.</br>  <br>That is essentially on the same axis of retardation at a lesser degree. Anything that deals with "morals" in a less than objectivist fedoralevel way is reduced to either pretentious, somehow religious or for children.</br>  <br>Will and reason are slaves to emotion. The root of everything you do in your conscious mind is going to be "because i felt like it" and the root of every feeling is the desire to garner resources and reproduce.<br><br><br> This sounds an awful lot like overcompensating, "resources and procreation" is a simply asinine oversimplification of human drive <br>Show me anything not rooted in that.<br><br> Humans are herd animals and thus VERY much have the mental mechanisms to facilitate good cooperation within the group, e.g. empathy, inhibitions against beating/killing senselessly. <br>I'm not at all saying it's in every persons best interest to go on psychotic killing sprees. Humans cooperate because we gain from it. On a personal level we also do it because we believe we gain from it.<br>Thorfinn however is good at killing and not much more, he is an idiot not to take advantage of that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Readers here need to seek constant validation that they got taste that agrees with the majority. So when one of their mainstream so-so manga(s) get called it for what it actually is, they get triggered. I doubt the posters original intention was actually that though.</br>  <br>Since you acknowledge empathy and say humans are ruled by emotions, perhaps you can understand how some people are more ruled by the emotion of empathy and some less? It's fine to say that that doesn't align with YOUR distribution of emotions but don't claim that that's somehow universal.</br>  I love how suddenly everyone has become super ostentatious with their words.  <br> trying to shame me into agreeing to the hivemind when I'm anonymous <br>Don't bother. Enlightened by my intellect as I am, I understand that there will be no lasting consequences for me no matter what I say.<br>Do you understand that? There is literally nothing you can do to hurt me in any way, your opinion is completely and utterly worthless.</br></br></br>  <br>because the easiest evasion/derailment there is is to point out "hurr cant english gtfo underageb&amp;"<br><br><br>who the fuck talked about hurting? people just think what you're saying is ridiculous and that's for you to care or not care about.</br></br></br></br>  <br>he already got you to reply, your inferiority complex have already subconsciously gone on full display for everyones pleasure to mock.</br>  <br> It's fine to say that that doesn't align with YOUR distribution of emotions but don't claim that that's somehow universal. <br>I don't directly feel like that, but I am convinced it is the essence of every living creature.</br></br>  <br> A kiddo trying to call out another poster while failing basic capitalization rules learned in elementary school. <br><br>How did you even manage to be worse than the guy you´re calling out?</br></br></br>  <br> ostentatious <br>Nigga, I don't even know what is the meaning of the word.<br><br> Thorfinn however is good at killing and not much more, he is an idiot not to take advantage of that. <br>You seem to miss the point completely. He is good at killing, yes. But what is good about it? He achieved nothing by killing more and more people. He couldn't stand against the Canute's army. He had no advantage in that situation. The only thing possible for him was to appeal to reason and emotions. By killing more people he simply wouldn't have suceeded.</br></br></br></br></br>  I award the fedora-thread of the year to this!  <br> spooks <br><br>Stirner is that you? On my /a/?</br></br></br>  This thread sure went into a strange place.  <br>Gutts is a beta cuck.</br>  <br>You're a funny guy and your dick is huge. Now that you got that, will you leave?</br>  <br>No, I'm dead.</br>  So is this still supposed to be a Vagabond thread, or a thread about seinen MCs growing up as humans?  <br> You seem to miss the point completely. He is good at killing, yes. But what is good about it? He achieved nothing by killing more and more people. He couldn't stand against the Canute's army. He had no advantage in that situation. The only thing possible for him was to appeal to reason and emotions. By killing more people he simply wouldn't have suceeded. <br><br>Thing is Thorfinn is a dumb guy. The guy lacks both smarts, balls and a goal in life. Let us say that his deus ex machina trick failed (as it should, but didnt because muh morale message). Everyone in the farm would get slaughtered, well, everyone that is left. What good writing would instead do, is have him apply all his years of warring around with Askeladd to counter back Cans army. Traps, guerrilla warfare and leadership. But hey, fuck good writing and let us all go the path of Naruto, path of NARUTO DATTEBAYO.<br><br>Waste of potential is what this manga is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Contrary to what you might believe, it is possible to resolve issues through talking, and this has been done in real life many times.</br>  <br>then we would not be talking about vinland, since that is a shonen shit.</br>  <br>So is this still supposed to be a Vagabond thread, or a thread about MCs growing up as humans?</br>  <br>Fuck that. All MCs should be ubermensches embracing their instincts, imposing their unstoppable will on others and inflicting as much pwnage as possible. All in all it's what humanity is about.</br>  <br>thread is about being pretentious. get with the program.</br>  What you still need to realize is the extent of implications of being herd animals. Surely humanity's first and foremost incentive and source of emotion is that of survival instinct, but for herd animals this is also applied on the group level. It follows that it's anything but against nature in extreme cases for individuals to even give their lives for the continued survival of their group. The degree differs greatly from person to person and modern society structures and groups has made it a giant clusterfuck but take family as an example. Do you care about your family, or only about making kids and money? Do you honestly just see them as another resource?  <br>You keep using that word.

Have to check what words that havent been used yet.</br>  <br> because plot <br>Everything happens because of the plot.<br><br>How about calling Thorfinn a conscientious objector?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's either that, or a complete lack of idealistic traits of characters and acknowledgment that we're only animals and altruism is completely pointless.</br>  The hell you mean my pre-order was cancelled?  <br>We are running through these threads and it's just the first episode.</br>  <br><br>First episode that badly received?</br></br>  <br>Yes.

I mean she really  kinda really almost kinda punched that fucking prince to death right? </br>  <br> Don't tell me they will censor the shit out of this. <br>Have you been following the threads? It's like the studio is afraid of offending anyone or not appealing to the greatest population.

He hasn't boned any of them yet but deepened his relationship with each of them. There are many more girls outside the harem looking in like Giselle and Mabel, both apostles like Rory. </br>  <br> And yes until now Tuka calls Itami dad even though dad's found alive. </br>  <br>ex wife killed his sex drive</br>  This might not be the place for it, but Japan accepted the Giant robot 1 on 1 against America.  <br>Well rori's crazy battlelust expressions are still decent, so have faith?</br>  <br> I-I dont even.. <br>To be fair the women who made it to the top all had to be tough as nails to have gotten that far.</br></br>  <br>Eh, we'll see.<br><br>There hasn't really been any "real" combat scenes yet, so who knows, maybe they'll do a good job.</br></br></br>  <br> her combat scenes <br>Seeing how they're censoring this show, I doubt we'll have any.</br></br>  <br>That as a backward country militarily impotent to the West, they modernized to become a world power by 1905 but had their entire empire gone after the Asia-Pacific War?</br>  <br> Ehhhh that's kinda corny then.

I will never be able to get over this<br> suffered surprise attack from the not Romans <br> Japan is too retarded to bother checking for missing citizens and figuring out that they were kidnapped <br> oh no, the citizens were turned into slaves DURAMA <br> Diet being THAT retarded <br> no mention of Japan being USA's buttbudy <br> not a single world leader stopped and thought about learning the power of traveling to other worlds, or magic or any implications of this other than MUH RESOURCES <br>I dropped it at the shitty slave reveal so I don't know if any of this is answered later.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> turned her into an idol <br><br>Disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br> Japan is too retarded to bother checking for missing citizens <br><br>They're missing you dense fuck, if they knew where they are then they aren't missing.</br></br></br>  I don't understand why A-1 got this.

The choices are fantasyland and best corea.</br>  <br>They deserve it too.<br>Good squad.</br></br>  <br>The thing is even though they know they might be on the other side. They don't know where exactly. There is no indication that they are slaves of royality.</br>  <br> fake battles <br>As expected from america</br></br>  <br>There was a bit in the manga IIRC where the emperor warns the Japanese diiplomats something like "there was an empire that prided itself on its military might but it crumbled and was destroyed by outsiders".<br><br>Thus misunderstanding two key points: firstly, that Japan's military isn't all that powerful, and secondly, that Japan's military empire has already collapsed.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You don't cross off people with no confirmed bodies.  The missing Japanese people were taken on previous scouting missions even before the Gate went up. It's in the manga when Noriko was hospitalized. Her family was near the gate distributing flyers of her and her husband, her husband died in the mines, and their house is burned down after a long time of no one in there. </br></br>  <br>And NONE of the JSDF reports on this foreign culture mentioned "they take prisoners as slaves from the people they attack, we should ask them if they took any of ours"?</br>  <br>Maybe ask one of those senators they were buddying up with? Maybe actually bother to investigate, or maybe use their peanut brains to figure out that a culture that obviously practices slavery could have put their citizens in chains and thought nothing of it?<br>Slavery is obviously completely normal to them and they don't have any human rights codes.<br>That forced drama scene really pissed me off.</br></br></br>  <br> we should ask them if they took any of ours <br>They would have probably told them the truth, too.<br>We were shown that they were all surprised that the Nips got so butthurt about slavery.<br> yeah we took your people, so what? </br></br></br></br>  <br>Man i love .50</br>  <br>Those missing people were taken before the Gate went up in Ginza.

And it would not be profitable if they paid miners enough.</br></br>  <br>It's still retarded that they didn't think that some of their own people could have been turned into slaves. Then they acted all surprised and horrified that the savages were savages.<br>It's shitty writing, get fucked</br></br>  <br>And we won't be alive when it happens. I wish I could be an apostle like Rory only so I could witness the creation of the first Gundam</br>  <br> miners getting paid <br> anyone willingly going into the mines <br>You go there to suffer and die</br></br></br>  <br>It's retarded that you think a defeated medieval army would take prisoners and slaves back to their kingdom.<br>Japan didn't know scouts were around a few months before the invasion. It fits everything except your baiting agenda.<br> get fucked <br>Just last night.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The joke is that Japan has pretty much no mines, because their natural resources are absolute shit.</br>   all those 10/10 babes - human, elf and demihuman - practically crawling out of the woodwork as the manga goes on <br>I'm scared to see how they're gonna fuck them up considering the abortion that is </br>  <br> It fits everything except your baiting agenda <br>No it doesn't.

If the Empire is Imperial Japan then shouldn't the nationalistic author make them look good instead of over the top, mustache twirling, baby eating, bunny raping villains.</br>  <br>But bunnies are made for rape.<br>Raping bunnies doesn't make you a villain.</br></br>  <br>Can't speak for the rest of it, but the Prince's words in chapter 47 are pretty much word for word the mindset of the Japanese towards the end of the war. <br>By 1945 they knew by they could not win, but Japan had never been defeated in a war and their pride would not let them surrender unconditionally. <br>Hence the approach they took was to try and inflict as many casualties on the Americans as possible in suicide missions to try and make them lose the will to continue the war and come to a negotiated peace settlement, rather than a onesided surrender.<br>Had the Allies gone through with the invasion of the home islands rather than dropping the atomic bombs, they would basically have had to wade through a sea of bodies of Japanese who fanatically refuse to surrender rather than die. Doesn't help that their initial plan was to invade Kyushu using Okinawa as a staging ground, but the Japanese plan was to throw everything they had in a do or die defense of Kyushu.</br></br></br></br>  <br> What is afghanistan <br><br>step it up m8</br></br></br>  <br>+1</br>  <br/>  <br> we want the Idolm@ster audience <br><br>l'm scared to see the monster girls, l bet they were all devolved into cosplay tier now.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He's such a dumb cunt it hurts.</br></br>  <br><br>This would be great if it wasn't shown that the bunny queen is just manipulating him to fuck up the kingdom.</br></br>  <br>Yep they even installed a pretender on the throne of another kingdom.<br>I felt that the way the jap government is acting is similar to the way they did things on the imperial era.<br>Forcing inequal treaties on everyone.</br></br></br>  <br>Fair comparison, considering that she fought alongside Rory.</br>  <br>We get the same here in Australia over whales.

It's just Lelouch stuck in a SoL.</br>  <br>Watch the first episode. Then go to the archives for the reactions.</br>  <br>She was around when Sugawara and Pina organized that party that Zorzal crashed.</br>  <br>Aaaaah, okay.</br>   THAT    Don't show any real combat <br> instead fill in air-time by dragging out useless shit <br>Seriously.</br></br>  I want to see a crossover where Rory Mercury works with Frank Castle  I honestly don't mind some of the problematic stuff:<br><br>1. They toned down the gore. This anime is probably going to be very well received in Japan. Patriotic, cool, funny, and sexy. It should lead to some nice children viewers. And if it was supremely bloody, then they wouldn't get as brought an audience. As long as they keep some things... I can live with my violence only being implied and existing in the manga.<br><br>2. Rory being changed from a GothLoli to a GothMagical Girl. Its sad that they did this, but understandable. Loli are getting alot of attention these days. And aging Rory up physically a little, changing her from a typical loli to more a Sailor Scout bodytype doesn't make me too mad. She is still an Eternal Loli.<br><br>3. The combat. Its only the first episode, they need to establish the characterization more. Big combat scenes like the mercenary army attacking the city and the Cobras roaring in with the Ride of the Valkyries blaring will satisfy everyone.<br><br>I am content and enjoyed the first episode. I just hope it gets even better as it goes along.<br><br>Kinda sad they made military chesty strong girl have a weird hairstyle though. She better be wearing her helmet more.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What does this face convey?<br><br><br>The direction is terrible, no helping it.</br></br></br>  <br> His smile, His Optimism, gone <br>He's anguished due to the fact that he never got his mangoos</br></br>  <br> and even if they tried the Americans would stop them. <br>Except that they can't. They will need an excuse to go through the gate and "We are preventing the japanese to retaliate against the guys who attacked them first and killed a lot of their own civilians" isn't good enough.</br></br>  <br> What does this face convey? <br>The heart-crushing despair of never getting a hold of delicious doujinshi of his waifu.<br><br>Also, I don't know how I feel knowing the fact that I'd have to call him "sir" if I ever met the guy.</br></br></br></br>  I bet A-1 didn't want to show any Nips dying. I think that we'll see a bunch of the empire dying,  <br>The coke and burgers would actually work pretty well given that the human body is essentially designed to get addicted to high fat and sugary foods. They can prettymuch swindle the entire OC world without firing a single shot.<br><br><br>You sir are an idiot. Do you seriously think an army mostly made up of minorities(like black people for example) is not going to fuck shit up the second they see a captured citizen?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The japanese got attacked, America would come in for a joint operation no questions asked.</br>  <br>The wyverns and orcs were censored, too.</br>  <br>Unless it's a foreign country, it ain't happening.<br><br>The gate wasn't exactly foreign, more like alien.</br></br></br>  <br>America surely gets involved, right? We came in and saved japs when they got tsunami'd hard and when their reactor when to shit.</br>  <br>Those were natural disasters you fucktard. No way the japs are going into an unknown world without America.</br>  <br>Well, modern Japan hasn't.<br>Then again I guess that was the point of Patlabor 2. To what extent can a country benefiting from the warfare of others truly claim to be peaceful?</br></br>  <br>A lack of respect for tone. Dozens if not hundreds of civilians where murdered and at a ceremony dedicated to the event he's literally in tears because he couldn't buy some porn. The author or the director really dropped the ball on this one.</br>  <br> he's literally in tears because he couldn't buy some porn <br>Crying over every single dead body won't bring back all the potential faps he could have otherwise shared with others on the Internet.</br></br>  <br>You should have lack of respect for Itami then. <br><br>His reason for saving all those people was because he wanted to go buy some porn.</br></br></br>  <br>Why in the fuck would America NOT be involved in this?</br>  <br>That is the most realistic reaction though. Do you remember how japanese react when two guys got beheaded by ISIS?</br>  <br>Busy with Middle East. Their attempt to get involved was fucked up by china and russia.</br>  <br><br>Mostly because Japan is saying No and they aren't going to invade another sovereign nation when China and Russia would join in if they did. All for control of the Gate and an entire world of untapped natural resources.<br><br>All Japan would have to do would be to blow up the Gate and the war would be pointless and over.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Japan wouldn't like a foreign army to go through their capital. That's tantamount to them sucking dick.</br>  <br>Japan wouldn't even care if it got embargoed at that point. What with the Gate they have all the resources and land they need to expand and cultivate and thrive.<br><br>With Japan holding the threat of just destroying the Gate and turning the world back to the way it was before, no other nation would risk losing being able to profit from the Gate in exchange for Japan being the sole manager of the Gate.<br><br>It would mean Japan would become the number one source of oil, food, wealth, and everything in the world and rock the balance of it completely.<br><br>Some countries might try to blow up the Gate, especially the middle east, because of the oil though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Japan could just Mass Immigrate, say fuck you to the rest of the doomed and dying planet that is earth, and close the Gate behind them and settle in this new world.</br></br>  <br>Middle East don't care about Japan. All they wanted was their own land just with fucked up laws. <br><br>US put a stop to that so they turned their sights to Europe and Southeast Asia.</br></br></br>  <br>Middle East nations like Saudi Arabia would be pissed as fuck if oil more abundant and cheaper then theirs started to flow out of Japan. It would crash their country's economy completely. All those Oil Sheiks would lose their livelihood and get rather pissed off.</br>  <br>Oil sheiks aren't Islamic extremists. But yes they'll be pissed off.</br>  <br>Things like economic ruin and shit like that easily can turn mild mannered people into pissed off extremists who will go to war or take a route as simple as blowing up the gate to maintain their cash flow.</br>  <br> Oil sheiks aren't Islamic extremists. <br>Depends on your definition of "extremists".</br></br>  <br>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Ranger Course, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on the Empire, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top recon scout in the entire JSDF. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before beyond the Gate, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me in this Senate? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my Airborne division stationed at Alnus Hill and your position is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Japan Self-Defence Force and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</br>  <br>I can only imagine all the diseases they would unintentionally bring with them would end up wiping most of the people out on the other side of the gate.<br><br>Then given several generations, the few aboriginal groups remaining would be rallied into isolated areas to be managed, like the Native Americans.<br><br>Basically, Japan would most likely have a whole planet (at best) or a whole other continent (at worst) all to themselves.<br><br>Having the only access to magic, they could very well come back to our world in the future and then go Rape of Nanking on everyone's ass. Fuck nukes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Japan better learn magic then.</br>  <br>Really? It was pretty obvious.</br>  <br>And as if that wasn't ridiculous enough, he's in the Special Forces.<br><br>That makes me wonder actually. Is he just on loan to the regular ground forces branch of the JSDF? Since they don't say he "was" SF, but that he "is" SF-</br></br></br>  <br>Or maybe after learning magic they'll return to being docile, make Article 9 for the Gate, and make gundams instead.</br>  <br>China and Russia could pressure for an intervention in the UN with "Japanees aggression" as their basis.</br>  <br> make gundams instead. <br> not making mass-produced mahou shoujo armies <br>Mahou shoujo are nothing to fuck with, anon, especially when they come in large numbers.</br></br></br>  <br>There would also be plenty of diseases the Gate people have that would get pretty bad. The knowledge of all the STDs i'd get from fucking Gate bitches is probably the only thing that would stop em from taking em all back for orgies.<br>Plus I'm remembering how when the Americas were first discovered syphilis(i think) exploded. This is much worse than it sounds since long term effects basically make you look like a zombie complete with rotting body parts.</br></br>  <br>I'm considering dropping this now, thanks.</br>  <br>And America would just veto them, because America isn't going to side with Russia over Japan.</br>  <br>Or America would veto them and declare they'll do it themselves since keeping Japan in check has been America's responsibility for a while.</br>  <br> yfw japan creates gundams in the next 15 years. </br>  WTF happened to Japanese anime? All I see these days is censoring of the key elements that made anime great. Sex and violence. It's like the SJW's have taken over.  Just watched the first episode. Jesus Christ, that MC is an unlikable asshole.<br><br> dozens of people dying all around you <br> muh convention <br><br> humanity gets access to a new world with sentient beings <br> muh convention again <br><br>I mean, things could get better, but with what seems to be censorship and the harem-esque feeling from how they showed the girls, this certainly is not a good start for a show.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>New law on the verge of passing.</br></br>  <br> It's like the SJW's have taken over. <br> Japan <br><br>No.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's important to remember that when the Europeans first started coming to the Americas on a larger scale for trade and what-not, they brought with them all their diseases, along with their technologies and weapons and other goods. Smallpox is one of the more notable diseases which eradicated a large portion of the native populations and made settlement of the Americas by Europeans easier than it otherwise could have been.<br><br>This thinking could also be applied if the Japanese were to start colonizing the other side of the Gate, and while the soldiers there would be afflicted with the natural diseases on their side, the advances in biochemical research would probably reduce the chances of their people dying.<br><br>How well magic works in eradicating diseases like smallpox and other diseases like it, no one knows.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bait or retarded?</br>  So the future of anime is cute girls doing cute things FOREVER!  <br>Wrong show bruv.</br>  <br> I was really amazed how many Americans made dark jokes about Tsunamis and Earthquakes on the internet just because that's what humans do on the fucking internet. These are the sorts of individuals that need to be purged. <br><br>Why the hell are you even here? Shouldn't you be sucking your thumb in a crib somewhere?</br></br></br>  <br>I know. I'm saying it works the other way around too.<br>The example I posted was of what was happening in Italy with what amounted to corpses wlaking the streets as a normal sight. A new world disease came back to Europe and spread everywhere. Of course thanks to the basic medical knowledge we have nowadays it wont be so bad but not watching out for magical ebola would be stupid as hell.</br></br>  <br>Then you shouldn't have attacked and killed thousands of Japanese civilians stupid Roman cunt<br>Oh wait, let me guess. You're one of those people who think chink lives are worthless and white men lives are worth gold.</br></br>  <br> literally extorting and pillaging the land for natural resources <br>That's what any modern country would do. Even Sri Lanka and East Timor.</br></br>  <br>Whichever you prefer.</br>  Obsolete and retired Type 74s? God damn it A-1. Hell, even the manga have Type 99s. <br><br>Still looking forward to the empire getting an arse kicking next episode.</br></br>   Even BDs can't save this censorship <br><br>Oh well.</br></br>  <br>You kidding right?</br>  Beware the breast beast.    Reminder that Akarin is the best and Chinatsu is the devil.    <br>  <br>I don't have a problem with semi-naked Yurus, hell we've seen worse in the OVA now. Sakubutt and thighs are a miracle no matter what.<br><br>I just can't masturbate to them. Tried a few times. Made me feel really somber both times. I can't see these characters as fap fuel, I'm far too attached. They're like my little gays daughters/friends, and not the slutty kinds you see in doujins.<br><br>  <br> It's so cute how you still have vaguely normal moral standards, anon. I sometimes forget that normal people think this kind of stuff is bad because I've been so desensitized by the internet. <br>I've been here going on 8 years and that has yet to change. But worst of all some sometimes my actual friends will say lewd things about girls and it will make me feel really uncomfortable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> claims she's best girl <br> tries to deny her love <br><br>Which is it kiddo</br></br></br></br>  Threadly reminder that all girls are best  I want to hug Yui!  <br>Whoa there, I didn't say I wanted to deny the best girl love.<br><br>If she wants to love Satan herself, it's her choice. <br><br>I'm just stating the facts.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But what if Yui doesn't want to hug you?</br>  loli episode animated by TYO when  <br>Then I'll just have to befriend her until I can hug her</br>  <br> S3  <br>It's so close, yet so far</br></br>  <br>I'll do my best to compensate for your abstinence.</br>  <br> tfw you will never be hugged by Yui </br>    <br>Ever thought that Satan might not have turned out so bad if he'd had somebody to love and be loved by?</br>  spot the difference  <br>A good Satan is still Satan.</br>  <br>Satan just needs the love of a good girl.</br>  <br>I want to hug her too!</br>  <br>No, but maybe the whole rebellion could have been avoided if he'd just been killed at the first sign of trouble...</br>  <br>literally no difference</br>  <br>I can help too.<br><br>I just want to  kiss her belly and pinch her cheeks. </br></br></br>  <br>Huh, interesting. Over the years I've fapped to all kinds of fucked up shit here, but never to yurus: they're just too pure.</br>  <br>Chinatsu won an art fair.</br>  <br>T-that's sexual harassment not hugging!</br>  <br> having moral standards </br>      <br>Good Satan &gt; Everything</br>  <br>I always feel like there's a mild distinction to fapping to the characters and fapping to the characters doing lewd things to each other. I can't get into the former at all, but the latter works for me sometimes.</br>  Cute things are my fetish.<br><br><br>I can get more invested in something if I care about the characters. Especially if it's a doujin of any kind, if it's from something I don't know I just won't be able to enjoy it on as many levels and I'd rather skip it altogether.

There is nothing wrong with Chinatsu.</br></br></br>  <br> implying yui isn't 10 times better than kyouko </br>  <br>She's crying because Yui's too aggressive.</br>  <br>It's just a joke, nobody legitimately hates any of the Yurus  except that guy who hates Chizuru who posts sometimes </br>  <br>I can't agree with that anon, I think there's something very clearly wrong with Chinatsu, and that's exactly why I find her so cute and interesting.<br><br>I don't think she's evil, but I would certainly say she's more "morally flexible" than the others.</br></br></br>  <br>I think to be morally flexible she'd have to have morals.</br>  <br>She does, she cares about Akari a lot and rejected the chance to kiss Yui.<br><br>Everyone except Akari is a moral black hole anyway after they all left her to die at the hands of ghost-Rise.</br></br></br>  <br> you will never be a dyke spending quality time with your dyke gf during PE <br>why live ;_;</br></br>  <br>My sides!</br>  <br>I wouldn't consider her affection for Akari to be an indication of morality, but her deciding not to kiss Yui does show some character growth in that direction.<br><br> left her to die at the hands of ghost-Rise <br>I don't remember that part</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not if she secretly likes it!</br>  <br>Chizuru is the worst thing since Stalin.</br>  <br><br>If only Lucifer had had a biscuit hammer...</br></br>  <br><br>Huh, rare to see Hitler get BTFO like that (after 1945, obviously)</br></br>  <br> I wouldn't consider her affection for Akari to be an indication of morality <br><br>Akari's a morality pet. I don't think Chinatsu's amoral or immoral anyway, she just has a really weird and incomprehensible moral code that she's slowly learning to abandon in favour of a more normal one.<br><br> I don't remember that part <br><br>I can't remember the episode but it's when the Amusement Club first meet Rise, they enter the room after talking about ghosts and think she's an evil spirit. Everyone clears the fuck out and Akari trips over, leading to everyone else scrambling the fuck out and leaving her to die. Kyouko cruelly and hilariously shrugs it off later after Yui suggests they should have probably tried to help her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I just found out that we aren't even getting Yuru Yuri S3 until fucking October. Will you guys be able to keep up the hype with these daily "YrYr S3" threads until then?  <br>PERFECT</br>  <br> morality pet <br><br>I don't know what this means.<br><br> cruelly and hilariously <br>They're my least favourite jokes in the show - I usually don't find them funny at all - so that may be why I don't remember it. I think I've actually forgotten a lot of the show. Is that in the manga as well?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, thus far we've been able to keep them going by constantly posting the same repetitive meaningless crap over and over again. I'm sure we'll be able to keep it up until October!</br>  <br>It sounds like the same formula for every other successful thread on /a/!</br>  <br>we'll still get the two OVA's right?</br>  <br>Welcome to shitposting general, it's worked for us so far.</br>  does anyone have the pic where  yui stabbed kyoukos eyes and shes crying on her shoulder? <br>i need it for reasons</br>  <br>Hey, we get the occasional manga chapter too.</br>  <br>One more month...we just have to hold out for one more month...</br>    <br> I don't know what this means. <br><br>I've seen it used in discussions a lot, but looking it up on Google just now, it seems to be from TVTropes. Whoops. <br><br>Anyway, it refers to a character who is pure/nice/moral/good (Akari) who can be paired with a character who is antisocial/amoral/abrasive (Chinatsu) in order to soften them up and give them positive character development.<br><br> Is that in the manga as well? <br><br>I don't think that bit got translated, so no idea.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  chapter 8 when  <br>Next week</br>    <br>We're getting an OVA in August, and you yourself saw how much fuel was added to the hype train with the last one alone. There's no stopping it, anon.</br>  <br>nadeshiko a best</br>    <br>of course i have it, anon-chan.</br>  <br>Never. We need to track down whoever made this and force him to finish it.</br>  <br>How did she lose her eyes?</br>  <br>He probably got into a fatal accident or something.</br>  <br>Ah. I don't know if I really agree with the idea of Akari being Chinatsu's 'morality pet'. She has scenes with plenty of different characters that show her softening up and displaying positive character growth, it's just the over time Akari has become her best and closest friend. I think Chinatsu's pretty amoral as well for the most part. Whatever semblance of a cobbled together moral code she has depends hugely on whether or not it's going to benefit her, until the Yui kiss really. She does care about Akari, but even that's selfish. She does nice things for her because she likes Akari and it feels nice to do nice things for someone you like, but she never really does anything for her at her own personal expense. Though the dream chapter is taking things in an interesting direction.</br>  <br> only 1 month left </br>  <br>Goyac's too busy making Non Non Biyori incest doujins right now. I am hoping the OVAs and S3 will spur him into making more YuruYuri stuff.</br>  <br>Considering the other pictures that went with it from pixiv Yui probably got jealous of Kyouko being close to Ayano and dug her eyes out so that she wouldn't look at other people anymore.</br>  <br>He will probably get into a fatal accident before that happens.</br>  <br>He's a traitor!</br>  <br>That sounds like something Yui would definitely do.</br>  <br>Are you aiming to become pessimist-chan?<br><br><br>I just wish someone would translate them at least. NNB Goyac is better than no Goyac.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, I just know that nothing good can get an ending.</br>  <br>The Japanese seem to be uniformly terrible at endings anyway.</br>    <br>A bigger tragedy than a fatal accident.</br>    <br>Apparently this is why Yui cut out Kyouko's eyes.</br>  <br>all i ever want is yui and ayano getting rid of the awkwardness towards eachother</br>  <br>it's over</br>  <br>thank you!</br>  <br>where is her arms</br>  <br>Ask Yui</br>  <br>She is reenacting the school days ending.</br>  <br>don't be silly, ayano and yui clearly likes eachother but can't overcome the shyness and awkwardness to become closer friends<br>it's like they have too much respect for eachothers</br></br>    Is Yui shy, lazy or just reserved? I can't figure out if she doesn't really interact with most the other Yurus because she doesn't want to or because she struggles with Yuru interaction.  <br>I was referencing these, anon. It's called a joke.<br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>    <br>she just don't like to talk too much, that's all</br>    <br>yui isn't that much taller than ayano<br>she's like 10 cm taller i think<br>i saved the yuru heights picture that showed the official heights but i can't find it on my PC anymore, fuck</br></br></br>  <br> 10 cm <br>She's 1 cm taller than Ayano according to the fanbook.

I only just used them for the first time for some auctions so I only took a look at that part of their FAQ.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127661697 <br>Liked, subscribed and fuck off.</br>  <br>Just throw them up on ebay, I just made 1300 from my auctions this week and that was only 7 listings. I just put up about 8 more.</br>  <br>How many do you have, bud?</br>  Just reminding you all that this is a thing and people will buy it  <br>Is that a new Zoid?</br>  <br>Evangelion rebuild. In episode 3 they get this thing that's powered by unit 1</br>  <br><br><br>I swear to god if you don't say is from Eva 3.0 I would have never guessed, and I watched the movie. That thing doesn't look like anything I remember from it.</br></br></br>  <br>It's that giant ship at the start that Asuka and Misato etc are in. I'm pretty conflicted that it's a thing to begin with</br>  <br>Pochaco erryday</br>  <br>I'm glad I've never watched any Eva shit except the original series when it was first on TV in english.</br>  <br><br>I remember the giant ship, just not that it looked like a digimon/zoid.</br></br>  <br>Yeah I don't blame you. The rebuild so far has kinda slaughtered everything<br>Asuka is a bitch with no explanation. Misato is just a slut, nothing on her daddy issues and Shinji  causes the third impact and is in a coma for 14 years and comes back and is sorta okay with the fact he killed nearly everyone and is eager as fuck to get back in unit 1 but everyone hates him and Misato threatens to kill him if she catches him piloting an eva <br><br>That may be from how they didn't show the whole thing very often. But I might be remembering it too vaguely</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I liked Rebuild 1&amp;2. But 3.0 just butchered everything about the series.</br></br>  <br>Agreed<br>But I would have like some back story to Mari</br></br>  <br>I got pissed at 3.0.</br>  <br>By the sounds of it a lot of people did</br>  <br><br>Because first 2 are basically what you already know but with more action and a few different things here and there, which is nice. 3.0 is just, quite literally, what the flying fuck am I watching? Nothing makes fucking sense, at all.</br></br>  No new Haruhi figures for the spinoff, yet?<br>Odd.</br>  <br>Don't forget about the fact that nothing that they showed on the preview actually happened.</br>  <br>Don't forget the gigantic budget and the addition of Mari  Sue </br>  <br>We've been over this anon, he didn't cause the impact.</br>  <br>According to the rebuild he did</br>  <br><br><br>Yeah, I forgot about this too.</br></br></br>  <br>No, it was stopped before the impact took place.<br>Come on anon we figured this out ages ago.</br></br>  You're still getting this, right?  <br>Only if I have enough money to.</br>  <br>Depends who makes it</br>  <br> liking the shitty Illya spin-off <br><br>It ruined best girl.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127664271 <br>Nobody cares indeed.</br>  <br><br>If Amakuni is the one doing it, yeah.

I just put a bid down on a Greek island.  <br>Can never have enough daki covers, but her appearance in artbooks is slim, and I have a handful of covers. I'd take an artbook at this point, honestly.</br>  <br>Well if you consider that Alter's Selvaria was at 18k at some point, and since the face of the Vertex's one is more faithful to Raita's style, I would have expected to see her soul out faster.<br><br>Yeah but she's at 12,5K (with the discount of course)at amiami (brand new), so it's basically the same.<br><br><br>Wasn't that Non-virgin artbook around 4,5K?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nop, that's the price with Japanese txa removed and Amiami's discount.

I know it's positive for the most part, but hearing the fuck ups is amusing anyways.  <br>sometimes that happens, it's better to order sealed/unopened for that reason.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, those are good. They are basically a retell from NGE with more action and a less personal problems of each character.</br></br>  <br>No Mandarake hasn't done me wrong yet</br>  <br>I got an unopened samurai months ago and found slight brown discoloration on her torso area. At first I thought it was just japanese semen folded X-times but I realized only recently that it was probably exposed to a shit light bulb with high wattage.<br><br>I also found 'dirt' on alter senhime's breasts which I was able to wash off with water only months later.</br></br></br>  Anyone support the anime by STUDIO 4C?  <br>Once. I got FREEing's 2012 Racing Miku and she was missing the little wedge that attaches her to the base. Manda, in true Japanese fashion, said it wasn't their fault and it must have happened in transit. Six months later I got a full refund from Japan Post.</br>  <br>Whenever I order something opened, I ask them for pics and most of the time they'll get back to me before it getting sold. Nice folks. Haven't done me wrong yet. Only bought 14 figures from them though.</br>  <br>I'm scared to ask but what would the price be on Ganondorf?</br>  <br>Ignore me, just read you said to ask on MFC. I feel dumb.</br>  <br>Do that. He said $450 a while back though.</br>  <br>Hmmm that's a week's pay. I do like my ganondorf though, even though its /v/ related and wouldn't fit in too well with my /a/ stuff. Maybe a separate display for him. Thanks for the info though, I'll see what he says on MFC.</br>  <br><br>That's actually cheaper than I thought, considering that was his retail price 2 years ago.</br></br>  <br> 450$ is a weeks pay <br>Just how do you live?</br></br>  <br> I live with my mom still actually. I am a parasite to her pretty much and haven't went to college more than two months before I left. That was two years ago after high school. I'm 20 now and I have no idea what I am doing anymore; I just work at a terrible job for Amazon opening boxes for 10 hours and get home and sit &amp; look at the wall for 3 then sleep. Sorry for the rant. </br>  <br>If you're an artist, you can try and do commissions. Furfags are the big market but you can make nicely from regular porn too.</br>  <br> I also work for Amazon, putting shit on shelves, but I don't even make $400/month what gives? </br>  <br>That's a very cute picture.<br><br>Food for my roomscape folder.</br></br></br>  <br>*$400/week not month</br>  <br>I'm glad you like it.

Instant vampire.</br></br>  <br><br>Google says the word came from Turks then went to Hungarians and then French.<br><br>Which makes sense considering the turks were fighting Vlad the Impaler.</br></br></br></br>  <br>the most brutal tyrants lived there. literally evil</br>  <br>They are really vampires.</br>  <br>Serbs in the the more remote villages are just very dramatic. <br><br>A man I'm not familiar with is walking around in the middle of the street at night?

I just read a lot about this.</br></br></br>  <br>shes probably pretending to be pure but is actually the dirty s whore in the show.</br>  <br>Their origin is downright hilarious. <br><br>In some village a woman got pregnant after her husband died. She claimed that her dead husband came back to sleep with her a year after they buried him. Everyone believed her for some reason and there you go - a vampire myth. Women all around the village started spreading the rumor and it was considered a valid excuse if you got knocked up in the old times.

Megumi's getting there. Erina is inevitable.

Megumi is at the precipice. Hisako has gotten friendlier. And Erina is just a question of when.<br><br>Can probably rule out Alice and Ryoko though.

You can't tell me you're an anime only fag.</br>  <br> the most calm headed guy, just loses it </br>  <br>Let me rephrase what i just said. Seems like you didn't bother reading it.<br><br> Sure at the early stages of the manga but please do tell me how she's a bitch now ? </br></br></br>  Why are there people who think Megumi is in danger of expulsion at the festival? Souma registered for a solo booth. Megumi is there as unofficial volunteer labor.  <br>What, did you drop it after the early stages?</br>  <br>I don't remember anyone stating that /a/non.</br>    <br>That's the only way you couldn't see how much of a bitch she is in the later chapters.</br>  <br/>  Yeah I need to see Erina's hot mother.<br><br>Her and the cousin are smoking hot.</br></br>  <br>  how much of a bitch she is in the later chapters. </br>  <br>what the fuck is this harry potter shit</br>  <br>What am I looking at here?</br>  <br>Haukyuu doing a parody of harry potter apparently.<br><br><br>Alice's mom has shown up.</br></br></br></br>  <br> no Alice </br>  <br><br>I thought Erina was the main lead girl of the series?</br></br>  <br>Extra extra puffy</br>  <br>Looks like a gigantic, shaved scrotum. Or a third leg.</br>  <br>great, now take the sample off</br>  <br>You're going to have to wait for hox or stalker to get here.</br>  <br>wait what, i dont remember this part. who is that girl?</br>  <br>One shot's erina.</br>  <br>It's from the one-shot faggot.</br>  <br><br>oh shit, i wondered why souma looked a little different. sorry, i couldnt recognize erina since i read the one-shot a while back.</br></br>    <br>kek didn't notice till i got a second look. GJ anon</br>  <br>she's not lusting after soma<br>if anything she lusts after his dad</br></br>  <br> assaulted in the butt by a panda with a split personality </br>  So how is a hujiao bing going to beat mabo tofu. I've only eaten mabo tofu, and you're going to need something awesome to beat that.  <br>Isami?</br>  Wonder what Souma's plan is......grab the customers that are still walking about during the evening.....?  <br>What if he pushed his cart inside of Yugi's giant setup</br>  <br>there got to be some rules you cannot highjack someone's place with all the registration and shit right?<br>but it is Totsuki so it might as well work.</br></br>  <br>My guess is something along the lines of a limited edition stand. Making people try out his booth.</br>  How did Konishi even make it to 2nd year?  <br>if you don't aim for the top or do bullshit Shokugeki, so far you will get dropped out if<br>1. get E or below in multiple lesson assessment<br>2. fail the Training Lodging<br>3. fail the Stagiaire<br><br>Konishi might be a pussy or unable to think of a way to overcome the A5 beef advantage, I don't think it is that difficult for Konishi to stay in the school.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's also failing the festival but you get handheld for that so it's usually a nonissue</br>  <br>Especially if you're in a club, like he was.</br>  Why is this series so fucking good? Like, it's a cooking series, but has the absolute highest entertainment value of anything airing. Also, the humming the ED theme was amazing. Just like wow, this is a good series, people who don't like this have no taste.  I think Yugi wants Megumi.  <br>OH LAWD HAVE MERCY!</br>  <br> people who don't like this have different taste. <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br>Sell to drunk people.</br>  <br> Sell   Megumi's body  to drunk people.<br>Fixed.</br></br>  <br>Since it's the BD bonus she might not have been introduced yet in the episodes.</br>  <br>Wait until Yugi runs out of ingredients and then open his booth.</br>  <br> That's the only way you couldn't see how much of a bitch she is in the later chapters. <br><br>You are right, she was such a huge bitch when she help Souma with his stew , and she was such a bitch when she stood up for megumi who she barely knew and straight up saved her ass from being kicked out of the academy , or how she has been a bitch this entire arc and not explaining details about the festival to souma left and right... oh...wait...what?</br></br></br>  <br>Hisako looks weird in this pic.</br>  <br> she help <br>You mean she accidentally blurted out too much information because she refuses to help him for childish reasons and quite literally only ate it in the first place because she wanted to read a manga?</br></br>  <br>Yugi could give less than a shit about Megumi or the other first years besides Houjou.</br>    <br> SHE DIDNT HELP HIM ON PURPOSE !!! SHE WAS BEING A BITCH!!!  <br> IT WAS AN ACCIDENT!!! <br><br>so going on a full on presentation about chinese food is blurting out informations accidentally ... yeah your hate boner is creating new levels of hilarity there anon.<br><br>please let me hear your wacky idea of why Erina helped (or not helped as you seem to interpret her actions) megumi.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;SHE DIDNT HELP HIM ON PURPOSE !!! SHE WAS BEING A BITCH!!!  <br> &gt;IT WAS AN ACCIDENT!!! <br>She quite literally said she didn't mean to give so much information, and she didn't even go into full detail, because she's a complete bitch.<br>Your waifu's a bitch, just admit it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Alice's mom has shown up. <br>Is she as hot as her daughter ?</br></br>  <br>I wonder what positions they each play. all the girls look cute here</br>  <br>Oh, also, you can interpret that as her hating the restaurant owner rather than helping Megumi.<br>And we have no idea if Megumi would've been expelled if Erina didn't intervene.</br></br>  <br>I live in country where baseball is almost nonexistent so I know nothing about the game. But I'm sure I would enjoy it with SnS characters.</br>  <br>Everyone is dirty except erina and alice?</br>  <br>Because they're richfags.</br>  <br>Can't soiled the ojou-sama.</br>  <br> you can interpret that as her hating the restaurant owner rather than helping Megumi <br><br>Oh man this is just fucking hilarious. <br><br> And we have no idea if Megumi would've been expelled if Erina didn't intervene. <br><br>yes you are right, we dont know if Megumi would have been expelled if Erina didn't intervine and allowed Megumi to actually acomplish what the whole fucking test was about , yep, nothing would have happened to megumi if the week had ended and all she had done was washing dishes and nothing else.<br><br><br>Come on you faggots are beating megumifags when it comes to delusion and head canon shenanigans .<br><br> NAH it didnt happen like we saw in the manga, it actually happened like i say it did  <br><br>kind of shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Erina's version of "What the fuck am I reading?"</br>  <br>Erina wasn't really helping Megumi for her sake. She did what she did she because she's Erina and the head chef is a half-wit dick. Megumi likely had what it took to pass her stagiaire but the head chef wouldn't even bother to listen to her.</br>  <br><br>ROOKIES no souma</br></br>  <br>Different anon. I don't think she wanted to help Megumi as you can see from the first pages of the chapter that she told her to not be in her way there. Her help came later on when she noticed that the cook was rude and didn't let Megumi help around in the kitchen, only wash the dishes which ofc is when Erina noticed and accepted that Megumi has indeed a good eye with food and seems to be good.<br><br>And come on, if Erina wasn't there to tell the cook to shut up and listen to Megumi, she would have failed. Unless another student was as confident and as good as Erina dealing with the restaurant, kitchen and cook, she would. <br><br>I'm not saying Erina is with the best attitude around, but you have to give her credit that she can help her own way even when she doesn't do it on purpose.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> yep, nothing would have happened to megumi if the week had ended and all she had done was washing dishes and nothing else. <br>Yeah because there's no way Megumi could've possible got through to him within a week or helped with a different area. Nope, only someone that isn't a stubborn dumb fuck would think she could.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Ignorant plebs.<br><br>Final boss is his dad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think that really depends on where the manga really comes to a close pacewise.<br><br>For example, let's say that the manga runs up until Soma's graduation. Erina is a logical final boss at this point. Soma wins/loses.<br><br>Final Chapter Timeskip. Soma is an adult who has done some world-traveling like his father to further refine his cooking. Manga ends with him starting a cooking match with his father.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what if he is having a cook match with his son?</br>  <br>Wow. Tosh can even draw hot MILF.<br>It's in these moments that I regret being a animeonlyfag.</br></br>  <br> hasn't read Harem Time <br>Anon I suggest you go check on his previous works.</br></br>  <br>Wet mandibles.</br>  <br>By all logic, Souma shouldn't be in the central area. The pricing, the street food style, his own "caste" as a first year, if his goal is to present a nice dish and earn profit from it, he should be at the main area. But rather, he looks at the festival as a competitive arena and thus made illogical choices that handicap himself unnecessarily. Will the school see this as a shortcoming, or rather something that sets him apart from normal-good cooks?</br>  <br>you are right on the first part; that's for the future, not for now. But no, not his dad either.</br>   /a/ suddenly likes Erina and hates Niku, Megumi and Alice <br><br>what happened? did reddit invade while i was gone?</br></br>  <br>I love how Hisako looks so harmless. Then gap moe when suddenly she beheads a turtle.</br>   /a/ suddenly <br><br><br>yeah, back to reddit with you</br></br></br>  <br>/a/ has liked Erina for a while now.<br>Megumi hate started during her match against Kurokiba, blame her fanbase and only grew.<br>People don't hate Alice save for a couple of animeonlyfags.<br>Nikumi hate is newer, but it's more about 'she literally has no character after falling for Souma'.</br></br></br></br>   Souma provides no wrappings or napkins for his black pepper buns <br>Are you just supposed to walk around with crumb covered fingers all day? No wonder people go for Yugi, at least he's got cutlery.</br>  <br>Akira always looks like he doesn't want to be in group pictures.</br>  <br>I think they'll say the food is what talks as always, if he started a fight without the skills to at least break even he doesn't deserve a place at the school.</br>  <br> smug <br> cunt <br> no friends <br> mommy issues <br>you wonder why?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He probably doesn't. He has no friends after all.</br>  <br>But reddit loves Megumi, like seriously loves Megumi, and complains about Erina pretty regularly.</br>  <br> But reddit loves Megumi <br>How do you know?<br>Are you from Reddit?</br></br></br>  <br>They droop a little, but not completely. Mandibles strong.</br>  <br> Unless SnS takes the TLR: Darkness route <br><br>I don't see that happening.<br>As long as he can make a living on SFW material, he'll stick to that.  Unfortunately. </br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a predator relaxing for bath time.</br>  <br> Nikumi hate is newer, but it's more about 'she literally has no character after falling for Souma'. <br><br>This is my major beef with Nikumi. She was a much more interesting character when she was intimidating and being an Erina lackey. I think her trying to be a better chef for Erina or for herself would make an interesting character arc esp when she lost everything after being beaten by Soma but sadly, she's just harem fodder. <br><br>I do like how she seems to be doing good with the Don RS but it's just glossed over than showing how she helped it get back on its feet.<br><br>It's a shame she holds the "meat" specialty cause I love meat dishes. I would love to see more of it and it feels like its wasted on her. Though I suppose its not the end since meat is still seen a lot in the manga but still, I would've loved more of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Erinafags from reddit are so buttblasted that they have to run to the anonymity of /a/ cause they can't circlejerk <br><br>Sadly for them, they won't find love here. No wonder the threads are getting cancerous with the sudden Erina tolerance. I wish it was like the early days where Erina was just the bitch everyone hated. All the reddit refugees would have no where to go when they realize their waifu was still hated.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its just a fucking ingridient, its like saying megumi chopping vegetables is shocking.</br>  <br>No one did that in the whole contest.<br>She got a living turtle, beheaded it, extracted her blood then turned it into a hamburger.</br></br>  <br>I almost feel like the author didn't expect Nikumi to be popular (look at the first popularity vote) and thus didn't think of her future plot.<br><br> just like Shinomiya </br></br></br>  <br> I wish it was like the early days where Erina was just the bitch everyone hated <br><br>Please stop pretending you even know what you are talking about.<br><br>early souma threads had no waifu bullshit in them and most people were ok with Erina being the final rival/eventual girl for souma and Megumi being his kitchen partner .<br><br>waifu shit became a thing after the training camp and mostly started by megumifags loosing their shit over megumi being mistreated.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>At least Shinomiya is handled well. His return in the Stagiare arc elevated him to a great character in my eyes. Now I just want to see him return once more.</br></br>  Meat Buns for 1000-5000 yen?<br><br>I am not so sure about this.</br></br>  <br><br>I'll be frank, as much as I'm not a fan of Megumi, I think Megumi vs Soma in the grand final of the Autumn Election would've make for an interesting match-up.</br></br>  <br>A sign that she will never surpass Erina's gold.</br>  <br>Nevermind.</br>  <br> Megumi getting to the finals <br>How about no. It was bad enough she got through the preliminaries.</br></br>  <br>Becuase thats how you cook with turtle , not doing it that way would either risk the quality of the dish because the ingridient would not be as fresh, or hell even change the taste of the whole dish.<br><br>again, its just how the ingrideint is suppose to be handdled so you might as well complain about them cutting fresh vegetables, etc.</br></br></br>  <br>it is just the general price in that area, I think Souma's bun is selling for 500yen.</br>  <br>No one is complaining about what she did to the turtle, the PETA troll guy left the threads a while ago.</br>  <br> the Aldinis gave all the girls uniforms <br>The aftermarket on those is going to be strong.</br></br>  <br>  I'm not a fan of Megumi <br>  I think Megumi vs Soma in the grand final of the Autumn Election would've make for an interesting match-up. <br>How about you stop pretending and just accept that you like Meh Gloomy</br></br></br>  <br>No, that's template Mehgloomy posting, literally from the posts when she was having her match against Kurokiba<br> dark horse Megumi <br> finals against Souma </br></br></br>  <br> I think Megumi vs Soma in the grand final of the Autumn Election would've make for an interesting match-up. <br><br>The fuck are you smoking anon?<br><br>Megumi making it to the final 8 was already a HUGE ass pull by it self, having her beat not only kurokiba but two other oponents after that is just crazy talk.<br><br> but megumi has skill... <br><br>she does, but not at the level of the people like souma and nosefag.<br><br> but the principal said... <br><br>he said she has potential, not actual skill at that point in time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> almost get kicked out due to bad grades <br> become the top 2 in the election in a few months <br><br>I don't think that will work well.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>But I don't like her.<br><br>I just think that Megumi vs Soma would've been interesting cause they're so friendly with each other that it makes me wonder if Soma will go easy on her or just go full-ass. Same goes for Megumi. She's so dependent on him and now she's against him, what's she gonna do? Roll over and just let him run on her? Or step up and show a side of her that nobody has seen?<br><br>Not that I'm complaining since I think Kurokiba winning was actually a nice result than making her win cause "muh hospitality" but I can't lie to myself and think that reading a Megumi vs Soma cook off would be interesting.<br><br>That said, I see that it's an ass pull to let her go that far. I get how everyone finds it bullshit. Perhaps in a couple of years when she gets up to the plate and is a much better cook. However, I still stand by what I said.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>okay, Souma VS Megumi will be cool, just not the final. <br>That implies Megumi beated 2 out of Curry, Ryou, Takumi, Alice, Hisako and Gigganigga.</br></br>  <br>ok</br>  <br>It would be an interesting match... eventually, but not at the point the elections took place .<br><br>Souma would not go easy on her because to him that would be disrespectful to megumi, and megumi would try hard but at that stage she really wouldnt be able to match up to souma.</br></br></br>  <br>you forgot<br> actually got kicked out but saved by Doujima </br></br>  <br>Will do. Thanks anon. <br>I only knew the Seto no Hanayome doujin of him but Harem Time looks really nice.</br></br>  [SPOILER] Erina a shit [/SPOILER]  <br><br>I have to give to Megumi on this one. I'm still baffled how someone who sucks in her grades in middle school managed to do well in the election but she actually thinks out of the box on that test and it was only Shinomiya being an asshole with the cauliflowers who didn't see beyond her creativity got Megumi in the red.</br></br>  <br>you aren't spoiling anything.</br>  <br>lurk moar</br>  <br>The test was not about creativity, it was about following strict procedures and weeding out weak students.<br><br>is it bullshit? yeah to some degree, but the whole academy works on that kind of bullshit.<br><br>the shampoo faggot got it even worst because he wasnt even in an actual test and got kicked out, but because he was not a main character no one jumped in to stop shinomiya.</br></br></br></br></br>  I can't stand Erina.<br><br>I can't help but feel that the Erina fanbase are the sad fucks who oggled at the popular bitch in high school and whiteknighted her even when they know they'll get cucked by the school jock.<br><br>I can't comprehend it. Why suffer yourselves? She's unlikable and any form of "Character development" will come as a desperate attempt of the mangaka to make her feel "Real" and "sympathetic" when in reality it's too late.</br></br></br></br>  <br> PROJECTING THIS HARD </br>  <br>Duhhh, it's really obvious anyone liking her is an absolute beta.</br>  <br>Anon you are the one that sounds like the sad fuck who oogled at the popular girl and got shot down super hard and now projects his feeling to any character even remotly similar to that type of girl. <br><br>also<br> cucked <br><br>You should not use terms if you have no idea what they mean, you just look dumb when you do.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The test was also about identifying the correct order to pick up the veggie, good students would have picked cauliflower first.</br>  <br>It would have been interesting in the quarter finals. Megumi making it any further with her current power level is impossible.</br>  Who "i like every SnS girl" here?  <br>I think Souma is better than all the girls.</br>  <br>Y/u/ki looks like she's making Megumi feel good.</br>  <br><br>You know that would've been a much more favorable scenario. Megumifags would be okay with her losing to him and at the same time, it can give some sort of growth for her since she is able to face a friend and went all out instead of holding back because of that fact.<br><br>That is to say, who would Alice job to if she didn't face Soma? I suppose she'd face Kuro and that does have the "master vs apprentice" storyline.</br></br></br></br>  <br>BRUH!</br>  <br>If the theme stays as bento, she'd lost to most of the contestants. <br>Even Megumi would have a chance against her because hospitality stuff.</br></br>  <br>Maybe he is an opposite of Ryou, does well at classes and tests but loses his mind when challlenged to a duel.</br>  <br>At that competition only 3 grand finalist that can top her.<br>Hayama with his +1stats because of Jun and prodigy with magical nose, Kurokiba because reason, and Souma because MC plot armor.<br>The other can't stand a chance.</br></br></br>  <br>Giganigga would have been interesting only to then see Kurokiba go full mad dog and curb stomp him latter on.<br><br>though her loosing to Hisako would probably be also interesting considering her "rivalry" with Erina.<br><br>with Takumi some bullshit would happen and both would loose ... jobs jobbing and all of that. im kidding alicebros </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Giganigga would shit on Alice hard.<br> muh machines <br>I'm sure Eizan can provide him any machine needed.</br></br></br>  <br>Could Giganigga even mimic her? Her molecular gastronomy techniques would be near impossible to copy.</br>  <br>Eizan can be rich but I really doubt he can provide all the machines Alice got.<br>Let alone the one that is probably exclusive to Nakiri International (patents and shits).</br></br>  <br> He just steals Alice's machines before the match<br><br>Gotta live up to his name<br/></br></br> </br>  <br>...anon her techniques relay entirely on her equipment, so as long as he can get similar machines then he could fuck her over pretty hard.<br><br><br>anon he doesnt need to buy them, renting kitchen equipment IS a thing, also with him being part of the ten seats he probably would get access to all of those anyways. <br><br>unless she has a machine that is completly unique and there is only one of its kind in the world, then there is really nothing stoping Eizan from getting them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hisako beating Alice wouldn't be that far fetched considering she was only one point below Soma in the preliminaries.</br>  What if Giganigga spitted gum on all Alice's machines?  <br>He should just get under her skin as much as he can to make her not use her machines.</br>  <br>Mah nigga</br>  <br>Having the equipment doesn't mean much if he can't use it, although I suppose he could have learnt if Tootsuki has molecular gastronomy classes. I'd really like to see a classes schedule some time.</br>  <br>that makes sense, then what about the spying part? I would think mad dog is also a good guard dog.</br>  <br>"You'll always be below Erina" or something like that would be more likely.</br>  <br><br>Considering Alice's personality, it would be easy to embarrass and make her mad, so she would be blinded with butthurt. She would be an easy opponent for Giganigga.</br></br>  <br> Having the equipment doesn't mean much if he can't use it, <br>we are talking about a guy whose whole gimmick is being able to learn and mimick his oponent's style , he would learn from stalking her. <br><br><br>mad dogs are not good guard dogs anon, they can be easly distracted.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Takumi and Hisako looks really good together, esthetically talking </br>  <br>Well he didn't need to adapt much for Takumi since he is from a dessert restaurant.<br>It is kinda weak but I would say what he did against Souma is pretty standard.<br><br>We really don't know the boundary of Subaru's "copy" superpower.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't understand the fun and novelty of meatbun.</br>  <br> They can be each other's beard. </br>  <br> the most handsome guy in school and absolutely average bland-looking girl <br>Just like in my love stories.</br></br>  Shiki is pretty damn awesome.
