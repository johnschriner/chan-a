Hayama is a lot better than people give him credit for.  nah, he is a cunt  <br>Now that's alpha</br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.<br><br>  That's heresy, OP-kun. </br></br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!  <br>Hayama x 8man brOTP</br>  <br> Doesn't really matter. A lot of harem stories have a main part of the harem sharing more or less similar level of affection from / towards the MC until near the very end. <br>Yahari isn't a harem. Harems are often shit in terms of writing and what you just described is one of the reasons. Many harems have a very clear main heroine bias and this would actually be a good thing if the writing for said main heroine weren't complete garbage.<br><br> Not quite sure what you meant, but I think Yui knows very well that she is in love with 8man. <br>They're both teenagers with a lot of teenager issues. Yukino has identity problems, Yui has problems with self-loathing, both of them feel inferior to 8man and are dependent on him to give them ideological guidance. This was reaffirmed in the last episode where they BOTH were about to seal off their own feelings had 8man not spoken.<br><br>Yui saying she thought he'd act only reaffirms that she was counting on him to solve their problem for them. Both girls are putting 8man on a pedestal, arguably no differently from how 8man and Yukino used to for eachother.<br><br> If we go with the theory that Yui gave her proposal expecting Yukino/8man to shot it down and talk out their issues, Yui wouldn't be relying on 8man to "give them direction instead of finding it themselves". She already knows what she want, she was just provoking Yukino/8man to speak out their minds. <br>You literally just described the exact same thing twice, except you replaced "relying" with "expecting" as if that's somehow supposed to make Yui's action more admirable.<br><br>The fact is, plain and simple, that Yui needed to use 8man as a mouthpiece, and that if he didn't fill that role as a mouthpiece, the club would have regressed severely.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hachiman also saved the Yukino ship from sinking by rejecting Yui's proposal no? If a ship is going to sink, it'll be because of his words alone correct?<br><br>Also, did Yukino actually have cookies in her bag or was that just a reaction to her failure to do so in the beginning of the episode</br></br>  Why does she sit like that?   Senpai wants to drink it?   <br>Look at Yuidad try to hide his boner</br>  <br>Hachiman saved both ships but it was not the main reason he rejected the proposal.</br>  Just finished S2, what the fuck is going on?  <br>At least word it naturally<br> Senpai, want a sip? </br></br>  A list of all interesting Iroha vids on Nico.<br>For those that don't know how to use jap Nico or don't bother.<br>http://pastebin.com/meEsfDWW</br></br>  <br>Why the fuck are Japs so obsessed with indirect kissus?

She's practically forced her way into being a main character for the sole purpose of making romantic progress with him, if she doesn't win then she might as well have not been around the club post-StuCo in the first place.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's Hard to not be out and have the man you love be in love with your childhood friend.</br>  <br> D) they agree to have a love triangle rather than settling it <br>I thought the love triangle was resolved.<br><br>Yukino and Yui telepathically communicated something and smiled at eachother after muh genuine.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I thought the love triangle was resolved. <br>I love this meme</br></br>  Why all these iroha poor memes now, when the show already has an actual poor girl?   My body was about to run out of control. In an attempt to push her away, I slid my hands between us and thrust towards the ceiling. Unwilling to be separated, she resisted and twisted her body. My resisting hands merely brushed against her soft breasts, stroked her smooth sides and lost themselves in blank space. <br><br> At that moment, Yukinoshita uttered a suppressed moan and writhed, still straddling me. <br><br> It was smashing. My rationality was entirely blown away by her unexpectedly sensitive reaction. <br><br> Letting my instincts take over, I swapped places and sat astride her. I laid one hand on the white nape of her neck and traced her lush red lips with my fingers. I inhaled her intensive flowery scent, kissed her collarbone and put my knee between her thighs. <br><br> She reacted exquisitely to each of my actions. I was aware that the blood circulating in my veins was enraptured by pleasure. <br><br><br> Right now———Yukino Yukinoshita was under my control. <br><br><br> That feeling of elation was far beyond normal. Even I, the cool thinker by principle, would have loved screaming as my feelings told me. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The volume pretty concretely de-legitimatized both the club members as love interests.

I wanted the pleasure to hold on for as long as possible. <br><br> However, I was suddenly stricken by a shock that made my heart skip a beat. I had noticed her unusual reaction. <br><br> "—You're trembling." <br><br> Yukinoshita blinked a few times with her eyes that in passion had lost focus. <br><br> "...I am?" she asked with gentle lip-movements, her voice full of heat. <br><br> She was unaware of it herself, but she was trembling all over. <br><br> Feelings of guilt that I had pushed aside as my rationality had gone out of the window suddenly sprung up in me like water. <br><br> "...we really shouldn't be doing this. Let's stop," I stated while raising my body. <br><br> Yukinoshita's "tremor" appeared to me like "rejection". <br><br> I certainly didn't stop because I was a good person but, on the other hand, neither did I enjoy subjugating girls against their will for my own satisfaction. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I just finished watching this series.

Frightened of shouldering a sin against her that could not be amended. <br><br> She was still lying on the sofa, looking up at me with wondering eyes. Behind her rumpled uniform, I could see her bulging snow-white skin. I averted my gaze automatically. <br><br> "Why? Didn't I say it's fine?" <br><br> "But you are trembling." <br><br> "That's because of excitement!" <br><br> "I don't think so." <br><br> "It is!" <br><br> The next moment, Yukinoshita said something I couldn't believe. <br><br><br> "It's my first time after all!" <br><br><br> "So I can't help it," she added. <br><br> No words. <br><br> I cast her off and stood up as if to retreat. <br><br> "Why?!" I shouted, channeling all my bewilderment into one word. That was the only thing I could do. <br><br> "Everyone has a first time," replied Yukinoshita with girlishly pure eyes. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a b-boyfriend..." <br> Blushes and bits her tongue <br><br>always got me there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>writer-anon. pls write more about other girls if you like.</br>  <br><br><br>This isn't the place to be dumping fanfiction.</br></br></br>  Iroha = Komachi &gt; Yui = Yukinon &gt; Sensei &gt; Totsuka &gt; Miura &gt; Ebina  Have you accepted that the Haruno end is inevitable?  <br> I'm fine with it </br>  <br>Poor hachiman. <br><br>His birthday present was 1000Y (8.179572 USD)</br></br></br>  <br>Tell that to irohafags<br><br>I'm fine with fanfiction</br></br></br>  <br> Yahari isn't a harem. <br>OregaIru is quite close to a harem. If we are to believe the Iroha's supporters that Iroha can be considered a love potential (I don't), then Oregairu will be a Harem (among other genres, of course, before someone says romance isn't only focus of the story). Anyway, the point remains: if one of the girls stand out in term of romance compared to the other(s), it will kill the romance subplot. <br><br>  They're both teenagers with a lot of teenager issues.  <br>Obviously they do have their fair share of issues, that doesn't mean Yui doesn't have a good grasp of her feeling, though. Since when "self loathing" prevent her from realizing she was in love with 8man?<br><br> You literally just described the exact same thing twice, except you replaced "relying" with "expecting" as if that's somehow supposed to make Yui's action more admirable. <br>This makes me believe we have different interpretations of "being dependent". Because to me, "relying" and "expecting" are two different things. <br>Yui "relying" on 8man to "give her direction instead of finding it" would mean she doesn't know what to do by herself well enough, and she need 8man to talk to get that. <br>On the other hand, "expecting" means she already planned what to do even before 8man say anything. She, however, realized the other two aren't going to speak out their issues and if the situation continue, she won't get what she want. So she played a 8man, gave a "wrong" proposal to provoke the other two to talk out their minds. I wouldn't call that "being dependent". If 8man didn't say anything? Well, that plan of hers would have failed, and that's about it, but we aren't talking about how good that plan was.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Who was the monster that chopped off Yukino's beautiful hair?  <br><br>what are you idiots talking about? haven't you ever heard of Achmed or Jamal? they already haev 8 kids and they're jobless too</br></br>  <br> "But that's not how you go about it!" <br><br> "That's different for everyone." <br><br> "...do as you please as long as it's your own problem. But this time it's me that would have been your partner, you get that?" <br><br> "Yes, you are right, I don't know if I will be able to satisfy you because it's my first time...," she worried. <br><br> She had to be joking. <br><br> "Ah, but I'm positive that I will develop excellent skills the more we do it. You know that I'm a fast learner, right? Be it at school or at work." <br><br> However, Yukinoshita looked dead serious. <br><br> "That's not the problem!!" <br><br> When was the last time I had become this agitated? I couldn't remember. Thank you very much for this valuable experience, Yukinoshita. <br><br> "Why are you always so... so reckless!" <br><br> "I am surprised myself." <br><br> "Don't act so unconcerned!" <br><br> "Someone once said that girls in love are invincible; there might be more truth to it than I thought. After all I do feel capable of anything right now," she nodded approvingly. <br><br> "Please, don't only think about yourself..." I let out a grand sigh. "In the first place, what happened to the rumors about you? Haven't you gone out with Hayama so far?" <br><br> It's not like I believed her offhandedly. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Iroha &gt; Komachi &gt; Yui = Yukinon <br>Had to make a change.<br>Irohasu~</br></br></br>  <br>Yui didn't really "expect" 8man to step up.

Wasn't she just playing with me? <br><br> "...I don't want to tell you," she averted her gaze to the side. <br><br> "You can't say that after dragging me in like that, can you? I have the right to know." <br><br> "I don't care." <br><br> "Don't be such a child." <br><br> "I bet you see me as some kind of slut!" <br><br> Yukinoshita pursed her lips. <br><br> She was now sounding queerly like a precocious little girl. Where did the bewitching girl that seduced me go? <br><br> "Fine! I won't ask anymore if you don't want to tell me." <br><br> I thought there was no use questioning her in that thickheaded state. <br><br> "...Do you really want me to tell you?" <br><br> "...Which is it now!" <br><br> Good heavens. As always she was hard to read. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Iroha &gt; Komachi &gt;&gt; Yui &gt; *power gap &gt; Yukino &gt; Sagami</br>  <br>You're just splitting hairs at this point.

Genuine really fucked with them, Yukino wants it so badly it must hurt.  <br> Yukinoshita took a deep breath and made up her mind. <br><br> "I'll be honest. I have gone out with Hayama before." <br><br> "As I thought." <br><br> "Hey, that's not nice, you know. Let me assure you: I may have gone out with Hayama, but not once have I given myself to him. I didn't even let him touch me like you have. Honestly." <br><br> "You want me to buy that?" <br><br> "Hayama were all good and a kind person and really loved me." <br><br> "...Good for you..." <br><br> "But every time something felt off. In some way I knew that he were not my destined partner," she told me with slightly downcast eyes, wallowing in reminiscences. <br><br> "Then why me?" <br><br> "Because you seemed different from Hayama! In the beginning it was just a baseless intuition, of course. At first I wanted to go out with you without thinking too deeply, as I used to do with the Hayama. Because getting someone to date me is simple." </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You....</br>  <br> Anyway, the point remains: if one of the girls stand out in term of romance compared to the other(s), it will kill the romance subplot.  <br>You're a fucking idiot.<br>Source: Every single romance with only a single love interest ever.</br></br></br>  <br> loli </br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Now where did you rip that off from, Yamokuza-kun? <br><br>I know Yukino is an inferior Tsukimori but at least you could have copied the sick scene to fit with current Yukino.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Yukinofags aren't cancer, they said.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hiratsuka.<br><br>HOUSE HUSBANDO END</br></br></br>  <br> Yukino is inferior Tsukimori <br>Oh shit, how the hell can I miss that?</br></br>  <br>Such a great guy</br>  How come 8man is always able to make thier panties melt?

Or at the very least, it's a harem genre (if you're one of those kind of people). <br><br>Yui loves both Yukino and 8man. And consider them as people she holds dear. <br><br>And there are more than one time when Yui step up to the problem in hands. Either because of 8man or Yukino. The last episode actually confirmed that Yui is the one who continuously seek for an answer. Even if that answer is wrong, even if that answer is not at the tiniest bit makes her happy.

No matter how you look at it the relationship between 8man, Yukino, and Yui is neither healthy nor natural, so I don't see how it could be considered "genuine".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what some of us have been saying for some time now. You don't need suffering and conflict to reach what 8man wants. <br>But of course the double YY fanbase likes to think otherwise.</br></br>  <br><br> I'm starting to think Haruno was right all along when she questioned 8man's "genuine".  <br>Don't.<br><br> No matter how you look at it the relationship between 8man, Yukino, and Yui is neither healthy nor natural, so I don't see how it could be considered "genuine". <br><br>It's natural.

You just become friend naturally one day without knowing.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, all this drama can be sumed up as the club trying to brute force the genuine. Meanwhile, 8man gets close to random people without even trying because he never put the effort and things just ran their natural course.</br></br>  <br>The club is obviously already friends, although for someone like Hachiman he sort of needs to hear it for himself.</br>  <br>When has Haruno ever been wrong?</br>  <br>Yuigahama Papa is the luckiest person</br>  <br>Gahapapa and Gahamama must fuck like rabbits.</br>  <br><br> Genuineness doesn't exist. </br></br>  <br>I wish, I was him</br>  <br>He's not as nice a guy as you think he is</br>  <br>Yui x Gahapapa doujinshi never.</br>  <br>Can't really call her wrong considering genuine's just a poorly-defined ideal that an angsty teenager came up with.<br><br>Nobody in the club even really knows what "genuine" is supposed to mean.</br></br></br>  <br>Iroha's role is pretty simple and obvious, if you think about it.<br><br>Her relationship with 8man is ultimately more superficial than what he has with the other two girls, and since it seems extremely unlikely that she'll get a "redemption" arc in volume 12, the logical conclusion is that she's going to fail romantically with 8man as an example of the consequences for not being honest about your feelings.</br></br></br>  <br>Doubt it.

Iroha has her own theme.<br><br>The name? Iroha.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>From what I could gather (just reading from random articles and stuff), its finance, time, a place to live, etc. Having a job barely keeps you alive. You'll be like in your 30's to get a good job. Both parents having a job could support only one child. And even with that, they'll still have a hard time getting their own house.</br></br>  <br>I don't doubt it. If they did had other children, they died in some freak accident. Like, they lodged chop sticks so far up their nose, they died. Or, forgot to take the spoon out thw mircowave while the food was in the process of cooking and the microwave exploded.</br>  <br>8man took an entirely different meaning of "genuine" than Hiratsuka meant. He ignored the fact that the majority of her speech was about the fact that it wouldn't be the end of the world if they went their separate ways. Instead he took his own meaning of "genuine" and ran with it.<br><br>There's a reason why Sensei has not been a significant presence ever since this started, she'd probably tell 8man he has it all wrong.</br></br></br>  <br>That's not even remotely surprising. Even minor characters will often get their own themes. It being named after them is usually just laziness.</br>  <br>How does writefaggotry break global rules?</br>  <br>many people fail to understand that the genuine thing 8man want is human relationship, not that person's feeling.<br><br>Saying that you have to "redeem" yourself to get some dick is just ridiculous and self-centered.<br><br>As a human being Iroha is doing just fine. She maybe not honest about her feeling but not like she is bringing any harm to other people or hurting their feelings because of it.<br><br>If she get rejected by 8man, it would be simply because he doesn't like her (or he is already liking somebody else), not because she was dishonest or some shit. Fuck people who thing they are the center of the earth and the girls must have to do anything to chase after their balls.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> “It really doesn’t have to be you. Someday, Yukinoshita will change and she might even meet someone that can understand her. There might be someone who can take the extra step for her. The same could be said of Yuigahama as well.” <br><br> Just when would that be? It seemed like something so far into the future that it wasn’t realistic at all, yet at the same time, it seemed so close that I felt it was awfully real. <br><br> “I’m sure you guys feel that your time now is everything. But that’s not true at all. It’ll eventually make sense to you. After all, that’s how the world is made.” <br><br> Those words were probably correct. Someday, somewhere, someone would definitely step over the line for her. When I thought about that unsteady truth, I recalled the slight pain inside me and I twisted my body to brush it off. <br><br>The thing is he doesn't want to separate<br> from them, he doesn't want to lose them, and he doesn't want someone else to be the one who understands them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Off-topic, spamming/flooding.</br>  <br><br>Ofcourse man. She was basically telling him that it's okay to leave the club.</br></br>  <br> Off-topic <br> spamming <br> Doesn't call out  nor  </br></br></br>  <br>That's exactly where the problem lies. He doesn't want them to separate, and that colors his (and their) version of "genuine". Part of Hiratsuka's "genuine" is accepting the fact that you might not meant to be that close.<br><br>And note that I'm not even saying the club members aren't meant to be close, it's just that 8man's anxiety-driven version of "genuine" is causing them far more harm than is necessary. They're basically a next-level version of Hayama's clique.</br></br></br>  <br>Thats fine. Yukinoshita is probably going to go abroad by the time the series ends, not sure what will happen between Yui and Hachiman but I suspect they will find the right distance between them (recall all his monologues involving Yui lately involves gauging distance)<br><br>They will have genuine relationships in the end</br></br></br>  <br> other people do it, so it's okay! <br>Cuntkiller gets called out plenty of times. He's also been banned plenty of times.<br><br>And I actually did call out the poorfag poster earlier. That started off as a on-topic speculation about Iroha's background and got out of hand.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They were already acting like Hayama's clique after 8man abandoned his ideals of hating superficiality and starts being unnecessarily considerate towards Yukino and Yui.<br><br>Yukino didn't like him forcing himself to keep up the fake sense of peace in the club which later prompts her to ask him the same question he asked Hayama.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Yukinoshita is probably going to go abroad by the time the series ends <br><br>I still don't think they want Yukino going abroad.<br><br><br>  it's just that 8man's anxiety-driven version of "genuine" is causing them far more harm than is necessary. <br>IMO it is necessary though. Considering where they are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The difference between Yukino and Yui is that we've seen that they recognize their superficial behavior as fundamentally wrong- Watari hasn't given us evidence that Iroha thinks her facade about chasing Hayama is wrong as well.<br><br>The other problem with Iroha's relationship with 8man however, is that while you're right that it's all nice and pleasant, we haven't seen it tested yet. You Irohafags love to harp on and on about how much shit the club has gone through while ignoring the fact that the whole reason they go through it is because they care enough about each other to want to see the other two really, truly happy.<br><br> If she get rejected by 8man, it would be simply because he doesn't like her (or he is already liking somebody else), not because she was dishonest or some shit. <br>And sorry, I should actually clarify a little here- it won't be because she was dishonest per-se, so much as because her facade, even with all the hints she's been dropping lately, will keep her from truly conveying her feelings to 8man until it's already too late.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Underrated post.<br><br>Also I hate living on Yuropoor time. All the interesting discussion on the story disappears into the archives while I'm asleep or away, then when I actually get home it's nothing but Irohafags being literally Hayama's clique in trying to defend their ship.</br></br></br>  <br>spamming/flooding you could half argue but how is it off-topic?</br>  <br> Spoilers of that end please? </br>  <br><br> many people fail to understand that the genuine thing 8man want is human relationship, not that person's feeling. <br><br>It's not a human relationship. He even goes out saying all kinds of it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A reason I favour Haruno. In the sense, Haruno is somewhat Hiratsuka foil.<br><br>Hiratsuka would never criticize Hachiman negatively whereas Haruno say what Hiratsuka could tell Hachiman about "not being genuine" and all.</br></br></br>  <br>Yukinoshita going away seems pretty likely at this point. Since the club's relationship is destructive, it means her family's concerns are well-founded. If they don't do anything she'll probably be separated from them by force. Haruno moving in with Yukino isn't to antagonize her, so if they run away and treat it like she is then things will probably escalate out of control.<br><br>It actually seems like a nice plot for the final arc too: They get the news that Yukino is being forced to transfer schools, 8man is both confronted with the fact that it's his own fault and that being separated from people is sometimes inevitable. Things probably fall apart with Yui not long after that, as the club ceases to exist and they lose their main reason for spending time together. <br><br>He gets a pep-talk from Komachi and/or Hiratsuka, realizes that he has bonds like Komachi, Saika, Zaimokuza, Iroha, and Hayato that didn't require the kinds of baggage the club was carrying. Follow up with last-minute 8man/Yui/Yukino reconciliation and healing, Yui and Yukino are again reminded that 8man is only human and they gain the ability to confront their own issues as well. They still ultimately go their own ways, but in a more resolved state.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And sorry, I should actually clarify a little here- it won't be because she was dishonest per-se, so much as because her facade, even with all the hints she's been dropping lately, will keep her from truly conveying her feelings to 8man until it's already too late. <br><br>you are saying he would choose some one who likes him (or like in harem manga, like him "the most"), right? Like a king choosing his harem candidate.</br></br></br>  8man's "genuine"<br><br> There was something else I desired all along <br> Not mutual understanding, friendship, companionship, or anything of the sort <br> I don't care about being understood <br> I simply wish to understand...gain some peace of mind <br><br>Literally no one sees a problem in this selfish bullshit? <br>8man just hand waves it with "I know it's a disgusting wish" but he follows through with it anyways.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If it's not a bannable offense then it's okay. While fanfiction is annoying for the most part, that doesn't mean that it's a violation of the rules.<br><br>Seriously, rather than sounding like somewhat adhering to the rules, you just sound like a jackass who has no idea what the word "fun" is. The Iroha poorfag delusion is somewhat silly, but it was made in good humor and there's no harm in it. <br><br>And that Yukinoshita fanfic was really pushing it for me, but once again there's no actual violation of the rules and you can just, I don't know, maybe ignore it?<br><br>Seriously, that pole in your ass seems a bit uncomfortable, but it only exists because you're the one shoving it in yourself.<br><br><br>But then why else would she be in the international class? There doesn't really seem to be a point unless she is going to study abroad. <br><br><br> while ignoring the fact that the whole reason they go through it is because they care enough about each other to want to see the other two really, truly happy. <br><br>I'm not that anon, but no we really don't ignore that fact. When Irohafags talk about how Iroha isn't involved in the club drama it is in the meta sense. The reason why a lot of people jumped onto the Irohaship in the first place was because her moments were a bright light when most of the novel was composed of drama that was largely brought upon by the character's themselves. Though there are retards who use it as a direct attack towards their characters<br><br>  so much as because her facade <br>But the whole thing about their relationship is that the don't use a facade around each other. The problem is the fact that Iroha is using Hayama as a pretense, but even that is barely even used and even 8man is seeing it's just a flimsy excuse now (from what little people have translated of volume 11 for us).<br><br>I do agree with you for the most part though, but you have to understand that the Irohaship gets a lot of shit so it's getting a bit tiring having to constantly defend it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because your personal fiction doesn't become Oregairu-related just because you named your characters after Oregairu characters.</br>  <br>A better way to phrase it might be that he's opened his heart to the other girls more, and been more open to exploring his own feelings about them.</br>  <br> somewhat = someone <br>Sorry about that, autocorrect being shitty as always.</br></br>  <br>They never stopped acting like Hayama's clique. See: Volume 11</br>  <br>Yukino need to quit the copycat routine.</br>  <br> 8man just hand waves it with "I know it's a disgusting wish" but he follows through with it anyways. <br><br>Its actually not selfish nor disgusting. It's simple really.<br><br><br> But then why else would she be in the international class? There doesn't really seem to be a point unless she is going to study abroad.  <br><br>International? I thought they get to choose from sciences or humanities? Anyways, the Yukinoshitas are a political family. They have no reason sending their child abroad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She will</br>  <br> If it's not a bannable offense then it's okay. <br>Just because it doesn't get banned in a given instance doesn't mean it isn't a bannable offense. Moderation is inconsistent.<br><br> While fanfiction is annoying for the most part, that doesn't mean that it's a violation of the rules. <br>It's off-topic spam.<br><br>It has literally nothing to do with anime or the series. Seriously, fuck off to tumblr, reddit, or fanfiction for that shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why does everyone call him 8man?  Hayama is a narcissistic special snowflake... Enough said.  <br>Because he's 8 centimeters</br>  <br>They get lib arts or sciences but the material is different. I guess its something like IB. It enables them to study abroad if they choose to whereas Yui/Hachiman cannot</br>  <br>Hachi = 8.</br>  <br> narcissistic special snowflake <br> Namefag </br></br>  <br>There's a reason Yukino isn't in the same classes as everyone else.<br>Yukino is in the international class curriculum.</br></br>  <br>Yukino is in international class, which is a special class for people who return from oversea, or planning to study abroad. Her class has a different standards and curriculum compared to normal classes (i.e: Hayama, 8man and Yui's). Being a political family means her family is well off, even more reasons to send her abroad.<br><br>I don't think she is going to go abroad, though, just correcting what you said.</br></br></br>  I know there is reference with No Longer Human. Yet, in hindsight, I find Kokoro more befitting with Oregairu.<br><br>And Hachiman's Kokoro essay, ring similar to what the Service Club is currently facing:<br> Triggering a flag does not lead to a happy ending. Someone may understand you, but you cannot achieve true intimacy. Love and friendship cannot soothe loneliness. <br><br> There is nothing that can be done about feelings of alienation. Sōseki referred to it as sabishisa (loneliness of the heart), but we of this modern era have grown accustomed to this sabishisa. We have accepted it as a fact of life. Or perhaps one ought to call it the building block of the individual spirit. <br><br> Through this story, Sōseki showed how humans are lonely creatures at heart, and that they can only live their lives brooding over their rejection from society, never to be understood by others. Case in point: “I”, “Sensei”, “K” and “Sensei’s wife”. Each and every one of them is alienated. They trigger flags and win love, yet their thirst remains unquenched. Though they share a common place and time, they cannot share their kokoro (heart and mind). </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Yukino is going on a trip solely due to the fact that her mess of issues simple can't be resolved in one volume. Watari simply piled way too much shit on her (family issues, dependency, lack of self-esteem, no identity, etc.) to get a satisfactory ending where she stays. At best we'll only get the beginning of it with her confronting her family, but doing a cop-out like<br> She's better now and she'll continue to fix herself <br>while staying with the club seems pretty weak since it's a bad case of telling, not showing.</br></br></br>  To those who think the club isn't extremely non-genuine at this point, explain pic related.

If a ship is going to sink, it'll be because of his words alone correct? <br>Yes to both.<br><br> Also, did Yukino actually have cookies in her bag or was that just a reaction to her failure to do so in the beginning of the episode <br>She probably still had them in her bag, but since at this moment in time she was aware of Yui's feelings for Hachiman, she probably didn't think it was appropriate to suddenly also give him the cookies she made. She also probably was too scared to do it, too scared to get rejected by Hachiman, too scared to lose Yui and Hachiman as friends because of it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> see yourself become the v(...).png <br>kek</br></br>  <br>Why do you think he went Genuine 2.0 at the end?</br>  <br>4u</br>  <br>8man's "genuine" is fake.</br>  <br>8man doesn't know what genuine is yet, nor has he achieved it yet.<br>The point of the ending was that all the 'genuine' they had was fake up to that point.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Why abroad though? I can't think of anything what they want her to do.</br></br></br>  What would happen if Iroha starts hanging out with Komachi<br><br> “Ah… Thank you very much…” <br> Isshiki squeezed the sleeves of her cardigan and vigorously bowed her head. Thanks to that, I couldn’t get a grasp of what her expression was like, but her unexpected, polite words of gratitude made me feel embarrassed. <br> “…It’s fine. It’s just a part of my duties.” <br> If she was insistent in expressing her gratitude every time for something like this, eventually, she’d end up adopting Komachi’s habit of saying “thank you so much onii-chan, I love you”, darn it. <br><br>Make it happen Watari</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  When Irohafags talk about how Iroha isn't involved in the club drama it is in the meta sense. <br>Fair point, and I can't blame most of you for simply not liking Watari's change in direction with the story. I apologize for lumping you guys who just miss the good o'l Slice of Life with the delusional ones who have convinced themselves the club is heading for Bad End to justify their ship.<br><br> But the whole thing about their relationship is that the don't use a facade around each other. <br>I think we're splitting hairs here, but my point still stands, and I'll rephrase again: the only way for her to get the kind of closeness 8man has with the other girls, which I believe to be necessary to claim the 8bowl, is for her to drop the Hayama pretense and do it soon.<br><br>And I'll appologize again for my initial post because it did come off dickish. I feel bad for Iroha that it looks like she's heading for "knee-deep in pathos" territory but that's where I see her headed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>U U U U</br>  <br><br>confirmed for needlessly ass-mad.</br></br>  <br>I didn't know I wanted that before you posted it.<br>Make it happen Watari, you faggot.</br></br>  <br>Hayama was never a "pretense", she genuinely hadn't given up on Hayama yet. Did you ignore her entire speech after getting rejected?<br><br>8man may have internally used Hayama as a pretense, but that's because 8man is non-genuine as fuck. Iroha's one of the most sincere characters in the series.</br></br></br>  <br>I think her issues can be solved in one volume since they are all related to each other. Her low self esteem and dependency issue definitely started from her family, so showing her "superiority" (lack of better word) to her mom and Haruno would fix that.<br>For example, "beating" her family or Haruno in a drama started by her mom by herself (with 8man and Yui's helps, but not spoonfeeding all the way) would give Yukino a boost of self esteem / confidence and remove any need of bowing down to their controls in the future. <br><br>There it goes, all Yukino's problem solved after 1 drama - easily fit in a volume.</br></br></br></br>  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/</br>  Tell me about Hayama, why does he think he's the bad guy?  <br><br>Who's author of these?</br></br>  <br>yui :dd</br>  <br>He  has two faces .</br>  <br>Sounds okay, but what Watari needs to do is actually have Yukino say what's on her mind. He basically needs to do a stream of consciousness her while we're dealing with her issues, would resolve all the weird ass ambiguities in the story as well.<br><br>In the same way we're privy to Hachiman's thoughts, we should be to Yukino's thoughts too considering how late we're into the story.</br></br></br>  <br>This isn't a series where anything gets resolved by "beating" someone you know.</br>  <br>I agree completely, though I still don't think Yukino going abroad is a bad option either. Especially if say, it defies her families college plans for her (since I don't think we've got any clear details beyond "different career track than Hayama"), it would make a pretty nice "fuck you" to them and her returning and reconnecting with 8man and Yui could put paid to his resetting relationships bullshit.</br>  <br>Since you're an Irohabro, I'll help you out.<br>Here you go.<br> <br>ぽてきち<br><br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?id=6900862</wbr></br></br></br> </br></br></br>  <br>Your suggestion kind of goes with fictional dramaland where the VN MC solves the heroine's problems by fucking her after fixing deep seated psychological issues by going at the source.<br><br>In reality, codependency isn't something so easy to fix even when a root cause exists. It's more akin to a psychological sickness and disease that's been ingrained into someone and requires gradual lifestyle changes and oftentimes counseling to 'fix'. There's no such thing as simply confronting the root problem and thinking everything will be fine - people oftentimes relapse without proper effort. I think having her go abroad with confronting her family as a basis will work well, since it shows she's taking big steps to change herself.</br></br></br>  <br>For my own reasons.<br>https://<span>youtu.be/U_yvN4p-Spc  [ ]<br>https://<span>youtu.be/-cgIgkYVYFI  [ ]<br>https://<span>youtu.be/4MeAYq9S294  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  I am starting to suspect that Yukino is in love with 8man. In EP 12 she responded to Orimoto, she seemed very concerned with what 8man thought about Hayama and her, she acted like a dorky high school girl in front of her crush. In EP 13 she really wanted to give him chocolates but froze up, she reacted to the penguins, she seemed to really hate the idea of a forced friendship with Yui and 8man, and the way she acted to Yui giving him cookies made it look like it hurt her.<br><br>Reading her memorandum made me think of the questions A) why was she so focused on genuine and B) what could make her that embarrassed while smiling? I could be interpreting this wrong and it is 100% about friendship.</br></br>  New Irohasu~  God dammit Watari. Just finish your work already. I don't wanna go back to these threads anymore.<br><br><br>I still don't understand the abroad thing. I can't see any merit.<br><br><br> slowpoke </br></br></br></br></br></br>  More Newhasu~  <br>"Beating" is probably incorrect word, just that I can't think of a better one right now. It's in the line of solving the drama by her own plans, makes things go her way and convince her mom and Haruno that the result would be better that way than what they planned for her.</br>  <br> It's Komachi  The title makes sense when the girl she has been looking for has been living with him all this time. Thus, the Romantic Love Comedy is Wrong, as Expected.  in that he ends up with the sister </br>  <br>Her issues really dont need volumes to be resolved. They all boil down to one thing: she doesnt follow her heart and desires. Her fault is that she relies on others to make her own choices and when confronted by Haruno on what she herself wants to do, she has a brain freeze<br><br>To solve Yuki's problems<br><br> Do she truly wants to do, whatever that entails. <br>Example: give Hachiman the cookies without needing Yui to egg her on. <br><br> Choose her own career path without any 3rd party influence (she used to follow Haruno to a local National Science Uni in Vol 6 and in Vol 10 she is following Yui/Hachiman).  <br><br> This is where the Yuki goes abroad theory gains steam, I mean Watari put her in International Class J for a reaason.<br><br>The specifics of why she goes abroad we can fill in later but it can be linked to family issues somehow. The thing with Yuki's family is that they probably care more about "image" more than anything so Yuki going to Harvard overseas or something wouldnt tarnish it. <br><br>Poof, we solved Yuki's problems of following others and she gained confidence and the ability to make her own decisions</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That artist clearly gave more attention to Iroha, he has good taste it seems.</br>  <br>3 is my favorite. 8, 11, and 15 are all really good too though.</br>  <br>Well he does say in the description<br> いろはちゃん可愛いですね <br> Iroha sure is cute. <br><br>Also he mentions that he made them with smartphones in mind so you can use them as wallpapers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't have a lot of merit I admit, but I still think seeing something for the second point especially would be nice. Just going to different universities in Japan could achieve the same effect, sure, but going abroad adds more dramatic tension to the event.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127399502 <br>Album-kun should add those to his stuff.</br>  <br>The biggest problem with your plotline is that it doesn't confront the very major problems going on within the club, it just dumps everything on Yukino's family who have never actually been shown to be directly responsible for anything. Even if they were, it doesn't mean Yukino, 8man, and Yui shouldn't need to face down their own issues.<br><br>If your only criteria is to end the series in a single volume it does that, but it is not thematically consistent, and does not answer many of the biggest questions and problems the plot has faced the characters with. It simply wouldn't be good writing.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Since this thought gave me insomnia now, how about this.<br><br> Yukimom gave her two options <br> Go abroad to study and be independent <br>   Stay in Japan and marry Hayato <br><br>So she chose to study abroad. Living in a apartment alone to practice being independent.<br><br> But suddenly, she met 8man and Yui.  <br> she chose humanities <br> Yukimom and Haruno is triggered <br><br>Is the second option too out there?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I don't think Yukino was going to give 8man cookies.<br><br>1. She gave cookies to the club already<br>2. Earlier at the event it was implied making chocolate for someone<br>3. The treat bag in her school bag had a different wrapping than the cookie bags<br><br>Thanks to these three points I have concluded it was chocolate she wanted to give 8man.<br><br>I wonder, did she mean to confess or did she simply want to show him affection?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, I guess that's why: I never considered to fix the problem of club together with Yukino's issue. <br>In my mind, I was planning an ending sequence as (Fixing Yukino's issue - vol. 12) =&gt; (Fixing 8man's issues + club and romantic plot - vol. 13) =&gt; (Series over, maybe SS for timeskip epilogue if WW want to extend it).</br></br>  <br>I'm <br><br>Yeah, I don't think they need volumes either, but there needs to be a clear direction with where she's going. Simply confronting her family alone doesn't really feel meaningful since we're just getting a 'promise' that she'll change. Going abroad is a great first step that shows she's actively trying to fix herself, which is why I even subscribe to that theory.<br><br> Although it could work if we're going by the theory floating around that it's not really dependency and just family issues because Watari doesn't know what dependency is. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Both of them would immediately realize 8man is a siscon.</br>  <br>Well, he doesn't deny it in his monologues.<br>Iroha should really just meet Komachi already.</br></br>  List of interesting Iroha videos on Nico<br>For those that don't know how to use jap Nico or don't bother.<br>http://pastebin.com/meEsfDWW<br>Updated today: 1 new video<br>Enjoyhasu~</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Going abroad is a great first step that shows she's actively trying to fix herself, which is why I even subscribe to that theory. <br>But then again, disappearing is kind of a miss.<br><br> Simply confronting her family alone doesn't really feel meaningful since we're just getting a 'promise' that she'll change.  <br><br>I think what she should do is just achieve something. Before her third years. Just something her mom and Haruno would recognize. <br><br>I feel her only problem is that she thinks shes a failure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Both of them would immediately realize 8man is a siscon. <br>Don't they know that already?</br></br>  <br>Have a feeling Iroha isn't going to get along well with Komachi, though. Would Komachi be happy to share her cute sly imouto character with someone else?</br>  <br>Komachi just wants to see 8man get a girlfriend and be on his way, and Komachi knows that Komachi would be able to take good care of him should that never happen.<br>I don't see the problem.</br></br>  <br>The club arguably needs to fix it's problem before they can fix anything else.<br><br>8man in his current state isn't helping anyone's situation. Yukino in her state isn't capable of doing anything. Yui probably doesn't think she's capable of helping anyone and so has decided to just aim for the 8-inch. Haruno's trying to show them the way but they think she's evil because the truth hurts.<br><br>However if they do fix the club they could probably end it without resolving every individual issue, because at least the characters would finally be heading in the right direction.<br><br>That said, romance should be the last thing on anyone's minds at this point. Friendship end seems overwhelmingly likely, unless Watari has multiple volumes planned.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They would compete everyday and the winner gets an onii-chan headpat</br>  <br>They both seem to have a pretty good idea of it, but I don't think they realize how bad it is. That said, Iroha immediately calling 8man on it when she learns he has an imouto is pretty hilarious.</br>  <br> but they think she's evil because the truth hurts. <br>Remember when /a/ was wrong about Haruno?</br></br>  <br> Except that Iroha can wish for more. </br>  <br>Not a, only butthurt Yukinofag.<br>Then after one week they shut their mouth when copypastanon showing her true self.<br><br>Haruno was right all the time.</br></br></br></br>  What did Yui mean by this?

Please elaborate?</br></br>  <br>Don't eat the bait.</br>  <br><br>She is divine.</br></br>  <br> Haruno was thinking back at the choco event <br>So Yui figured out that Haruno was shitting on them pretending there is no love triangle going on?</br></br>  <br>Hitler was beautiful<br>Haruno is beautiful<br>Hitler is divine<br>Haruno is divine<br>Hitler was right<br>Haruno is right<br>Both their names start with H<br>Coincidence?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dependency, which become so bad that Yukinon need to copy 8man's words to a T just so she can continue speaking<br><br>That Haruno was right doesn't change the fact that she's condescending uber bitch</br></br></br>  <br>Indeed.</br>  http://strawpoll.me/4788979  Orimoto needs to show up again.

He even looked visibly pissed off when 8man made a bunch of excuses for helping Iroha out all the time.  <br>Yes it does.</br>  <br>Isn't it obvious? It's because  it would hurt Yukino </br>  <br>I don't know, may be because she loves him?<br><br> I thought she loves the cookie man, but may be she is in love with Hikki after all </br></br></br>  <br>Nigga everyone with some good sense ships IroHachi.<br><br><br>I know that feeling. The poll currently agrees.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I think it's been firmly established that the EU is owned heart and soul by Iroha, so it's not like it's a surprise or anything. If that got posted hours from now when Americans were all settling in to stare into the abyss that is 4chan for the rest of the night it would be a different story.</br></br>  <br>Obviously because he likes Y.</br>  <br>He knows she is a slut, that's why</br>  Hayama should man up and fix his relationship with Yukino<br>I think that would help Yukino to fix her problem</br>  <br> Hitler is a leader <br> Hayato is a leader <br><br>Hayato is a fucking beta turbocuck who instead of acting how he wants, he acts how it's expected of him simply to maintain the easy as shit status quo.

But then the last episode just confirmed that cookie man is 8man all along. </br>  <br>Their relationship is already fixed, but that doesn't mean they are close anymore.</br>  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br>Hayato's not quite as wrong as 8man is, at least.</br>  <br>Or asian.

Anyone who wants to read it can read it and G in like 3 hours, tops, it's pretty short.        it seems like there actually a cool down on OP bumps not an outright block on them.    <br>Yes. I do take breaks from time to time, although I don't need them if readers reply.</br>      <br> hating on stroytimes </br>    <br>More Ishikawa stuff.<br><br>I never really found them interesting. Most don't have any accompanying commentary or explanations and are just imagedumps.</br></br></br>  Oh cool, Getter dump. never got past the fight where Musashi pretended to be the professor to pilot the Getter.<br><br><br><br>It's so weird seeing him be an absolute psychopath then become polite after recruitment.</br></br></br></br>        <br>Getter Robo Go is the absolute height of the Getter saga, and I'd really recommend you read it because it's simply very good. The original 70s manga is charming too but Getter Robo Go is the one translated Ishikawa work that excellently showcases why he's one of the pioneers of scifi horror and biomechanics in manga. Plus, I find the way he characterizes his protagonists as hotblooded but cautious, gritty and intelligent very interesting.</br>  <br>Have you ever done a storytime? Unless you're a walking encyclopedia on whatever you're dumping, you run out of commentary pretty fast.</br>  <br><br>I get that you don't like storytimes, (I personally do, and I prefer reading them on 4chan than on some manga site considering i spend most of my time here), that said, this thread is for people who do enjoy storytimes.<br><br>If you want a Getter thread that ain't storytime, be my guest.</br></br></br></br>      <br>Well, commentary doesn't need to be constant - I meant things more like explanations of specialized scientific terms, references to other media and media the scene in particular influenced etc. Their whole charm for me is basically being unobtrusive tlnotes</br>      <br>Like I said. Not many people can do that. I don't think I've even seen anyone do that before.</br>      <br>It used to be pretty common on /co/ and /tg/. I remember someone doing a Nemesis the Warlock one waaay back and explaining the weird metacomics with the actual comic authors as characters. I haven't been on either board in years though</br>                              up            <br>What happens?</br>    <br>The content is good enough to me that it doesn't require commentary. You're enjoying the manga, as presented by the manga artist. You're not supposed to obsess over every little detail.<br><br>Not fond of translation notes that come up on the screen in many anime fansubs either.</br></br></br>      <br>The equivalent to what he's taking about would be like a separate text file you can read after watching the episode.</br>                                                                              <br><br> That cobra face <br><br><br><br><br>Hou much tamer was this in the original anime?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>        <br>I agree with you.</br>                                  So after Getter Robo and Getter Robo G, where should I go next? Shin or Go?          <br><br>Who's the kid?</br></br>            <br>Production order, so Go.</br>  ITT: Post the best character from their respective series.<br><br>I will begin:</br></br>  Muhi a shit<br><br> Rabura best </br></br>  What the fuck was up with the QUALITY this episode and where the fuck is Vivid?        <br>There seems to be a dialogue box cut off in the top right corner, and there aren't any spoiler pics so there's not much I can do about it. Will find out what it says from the anon with volume 10 and put it in the revisions.</br>  <br>They reused animation from the opening too</br>  Cont. discussion from   reposting from last thread:<br>[About the keyword of the project - 新生 - rebirth/second birth]<br> They want to reintroduce Tsukihime to player and they thought about what to do. <br> Nasu feels lot like when the worked on Mahoyo. Making graphics better, taking the scenartio to another level, but the base stays the same. <br> They want to make the player think "nostalgic but fresh" about some things they see in the game, move his feelings by some things, suprise him, and to give it all Type-Moon has. <br><br>[About the setting change]<br> The setting now change from a city that resembled "vaguely Tokyo suburbs" to pretty clearly "Tokyo metropolitan area". The scale of the incidents doesn't change, but the new scale of the setting might affect the story in some way, pls look forward to it. <br> Long talk about how different settings might feel. Original Tsukihime and Mahoyo are kinda like "what if something happened here" to new "big cities are scary, isn't it, things like this happen in big cities". <br> Takeuchi says a big city is more fit for modern vampire stories.  <br> They're talking about how they did location scounting around Tokyo, but won't say which specific places are inspired by. They don't want the players to know what to specifically look forwatd ro yet. <br> The Toono mansion and the school are being remade in details. The mansion will still be Western style and will feel like the best place for murder incidents to happen.  <br> They're talking about the 3D image of the mansion that's on a different page. Takeuchi is making a 3D model of it, which makes drawing easier, but it's also hard, since he needs to create all the details and mind object collisions.  <br> Nasu says that when you add the characters and text it really feels like a proper mystery/horror etc. and is really happy to be making a hype of game he likes. <br> Talk about how the mansion doesn't really look scary at night, but gets ominous at night, like Resi 1 mansion. <br>(cont.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>(cont.)<br> They're asked if there'll be elements of local folklore/traditions - basically what people talk about between themselves and pass it. Since the scale of the setting has changed, it might be about how Toonos got the mansion and th lands around.  <br><br>[About the character design change]<br> Takeuchi says he created a more modern designs while for example keeping the image of Arcueid as "pure white" vampire.  <br> Also pls get used to the new designs already.  <br> Nasu asks if because of the change of setting he gave Arcueif a miniskirt.  <br> Not really, but...

He did eventually get it, though. His current whereabouts are off training in the mountains by punching boulders apart. Hrm, perhaps "training" is a misnomer - honing his skills/innate talents, basically.<br><br>But yeah, that's kind of what I was referencing before. Even without training and while insane, he was still a considerable threat. Although, I would actually say the reason he's so able to kill while Akiha isn't is because the inversion impulse has shucked away his inhibitions. I can't imagine him taking on Ciel or Arc or a Servant even if he was lucid. That's actually why I mentioned his MEoDP which works on similar principles to Akiha's plundering - absorbing odic force. If he was actually primed for combat beyond his base mentality, he actually might be quite dangerous because he does have a means of attacking on a conceptual level.<br><br>However, nothing beats a fully-incarnated Roa in his body.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not using the Melty Blood designs <br><br>shit nigga what are you doing</br></br></br>  <br>These designs are five years old</br>  DDD2 ending was full trainwreck. I glad last chapter was a dream<br><br>Tell me how to draw different anime faces.<br>Shiki for example. Everything is about eyes and hairs.</br></br></br>  When should non-leak scans start coming through?  <br>Wait is Mahoyo translated?<br><br>If so, where do I get it?</br></br></br>  <br>I think he confused DDD's True Demons with Nasuverse's ones. They aren't the same.</br>  <br> DDD2 ending was full trainwreck. I glad last chapter was a dream <br><br>Oh please tell me it was a dream. That last chapter was so fucking dumb.</br></br></br>  <br>If you know French then it is,</br>    <br><br>It was definitely a dream. But it spawned some side stories explaining the powers of the people in the Ward D.</br></br>  <br>Yes but in acknowledging them it acknowledged the same concept of god was in play basically.<br><br>If demons are fallible and pointless, then god is perfect and flawless. Demons can't help fucking around with humans since they're flawed and stupid, but the more perfect an existence is out there the more on its own it is there.</br></br></br>  <br>A new character making its appearance into the world of Tsukihime. That cheerful expression may give a friendly impression, however....<br><br><br>B-but he got a call of Tomato saying Origa was going crazy. There's a chance it'll happen. It was an interesting chapter, I liked it. Hirumiya a cute.</br></br></br></br>  <br> however.... <br>Oh boy here we go<br>Also what about red text, it's something she said right?</br></br></br>  <br>True Ancestors?<br><br>They're alien vampires that sometimes are closer to the existence of a planet than a vampire. There were a lot of them, they couldn't all be on the level of a planet, but Arc was supposedly the best or something as she killed the others. When she regained her sanity she got in contract with Gaia, and they made a contract so she was given access rights.<br><br>Gaia used to know her Pappy after all</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Demonic presence in DDD is still mystery. It's 100% not "psychology" phenomenon.</br>    <br>C-cute</br>    <br>I mean TA as in Archetype earth or arcueid<br>So the Types aren't god in any sense? I thought at first because the post mentioned piece of planet that Types = god</br></br>  Is there someone willing enough to edit some proper vents on remake arc when the vn comes out?  <br>TAs are more fairies than aliens or vampires. They don't make contracts with Gaia, they are born as part of Gaia.</br>  <br>Most gods are basically elementals, which are below the planet in nature. Since they're parts of the planet that gained worship to stand out, but they still cannot surpass the planet itself.</br>  <br>Looks better in my opinion.</br>  <br>Make it without glasses</br>  <br> Alien vampires closer to the existence of a planet <br><br>Not even.</br></br></br>  <br>No, they are higher than gods.

"Al-right. Calm down and take your seat, monkeys. It's great that you're so lively, but if you're not going act human Sensei won't be able to go easy on you, and that'd be terrible."</br>  <br><br>This is inaccurate.<br><br>Essentially, Gaia needed help creating a tangible counterforce. It created Primate Murder at some unspecified time in the past, but Gaia had other "plans" for humanity (insofar as it as a force is capable of planning) and so culling them whenever they became unruly was not ideal. Enter Crimson Moon Brunestud, who agreed to allow Gaia to create agents of its "will" based on him/itself. True Ancestors are the "touch of the planet," they're sapient sensory organs for a force whose existence is beyond human comprehension, that of our planet itself. Brunestud, however, had ulterior motives (he wanted to use them as additional bodies to incarnate into should he be destroyed), and all of the True Ancestors inherited a key imperfection of his - his hunger for blood. This is what leads to Demon Lords (note the parallels with Demons who are spawned from corrupted Elementals).<br><br>For Brunestud to incarnate into a True Ancestor, they must be a "perfect" equivalent to him. Arcueid was the closest shinso to this definition and also the most powerful of them all. She was created specifically to have no real self of her own and only to carry out the necessary destruction of Demon Lords and rampant DAAs. However, the True Ancestors tried to get Roa to teach her and all the bad shit went down with him feeding her blood (this is apparently a retcon, though), ending in the destruction of almost all of them.<br><br>Arc made no contract with Gaia. She has an innate connection. All True Ancestors do. They're like elementals but on a much, much higher level.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not even. <br>True Ancestors are technically spawns of Crimson Moon, given form by Gaia.</br></br>  <br>Live-in Student<br><br>1<br>Gray: Good morning, master.<br>2<br>Waver: Morning, Gray.

I mean, they managed to create a bunch of relics that could bend all of reality on a universal scale and planted them on random rocks throughout the galaxy to observe and record all parallel fluctuations since even before Gaia existed.<br><br>The scale of such technology (or magic) is so mindboggingly immense that it blows my mind. Nasu must have been on drugs when he wrote that shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, they're like white blood cells, rather than being a planet unto themselves each.<br><br>Earth isn't just full of planets, a white blood cell isn't equal to the body.<br><br>Only Arc can reach that level.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Actually, CCC refers to lots of aliens, not just the ones who created the Moon Cell. It is even mentioned that Moon Cell is used by other aliens to observe humanity.</br>  <br><br>They look nothing alike?</br></br>  <br><br>Feels right</br></br>  <br>Fucking aliens, taking our jobs<br><br>Even Aristotles are just aliens.<br><br>Everything is aliens</br></br></br></br></br>   mfw Tsukihime is actually a rip-off of Kizuato <br> EOPs will never know Kizuato </br>  <br>Could you do the same for </br>  <br>Who will win the Gray?<br><br>Also, wasn't Flat also trying to date the mercury maid?</br></br></br>  <br>NOT ANIME OR MANGA<br><br>FUCK OFFFF</br></br></br>  Reminder that Shirou would wreck Shiki and Nasu just said death-draw to not piss off the fans  <br>Does it? Which scene specifically? Because I remember it just using a catch-all term for those aliens (which is why there was a lot of discussion over the demon bullshit on BL).</br>  <br>They took er jeeeeeeebs!</br>  <br> Caring about Kizuato <br><br>Even if the far side is a rip-off in some grade tsukihime is much better anyway.</br></br></br>  <br> not manga <br>Tsukihime has a manga retard.</br></br>  <br>The old part of /a/ and jaypee knew kizuato before you.</br>  <br>Its the other way around.<br>Shiki would win but his mind would explode conveniently afterwards.</br></br>  <br>A really good one, too.</br>  <br>That's not what the discussion is about.<br><br>MODS</br></br></br>  <br>8/10<br><br>Harem well deserved.</br></br></br>  I think I've figured out my issue with Arc's new-ish design. Original Arc's hair and skirt had length enough to swirl about her when she moved, new Arc's don't.  <br>Have respect for Takahashi.</br>  <br>arc is so much more attractive with that skirt and those shoes<br><br>fuck miniskirt shit</br></br></br>  <br>This shit has so many bs scenes... kinda weird that this one is the only that i think that can actually happen.</br>  <br> being this new </br>  <br>BB threatening to unplug the whole thing and getting lots of complaints from other alien lifeforms, I don't remember the exact point but it was near the end.</br>  <br>Arc is probably the only redesign that I really don't like.<br><br>Maybe Ciel too, since she turned into a generic megane slut.</br></br></br>  <br>Shiki &gt; Shirou in hotness</br>  <br>arc photoshops when?</br>  <br><br><br>My body isn't ready for Nanaya.</br></br></br>  <br>That is one ugly ass courtyard. Even symmetry doesn't save it.</br>  <br>Well she's supposed to be cute school girl and not a snarky sick killer.</br>  <br>I'm actually okay with Arc in a miniskirt, just not one that's as short as it is.<br><br>It hadn't even occurred to me that something was off with new Arc's footwear until now, but as much as I like the boots the original shoes are superior. They certainly wouldn't work with any kind of miniskirt, though.</br></br></br>  <br>The whole Enum Elish vs Nero thing also kinda makes sense.</br>  <br>MOOOODDDSSS</br>  <br>Is Arc's lust for dicks greater than her lust for blood?</br>  <br>It looks like a pokemon arena.</br>  <br>I never understood that ending. Aren't Gil and Hakuno still trapped within the moon cell in the normal end? Or how did Gil break out and Hakuno retains her memories?</br>  <br><br>Someone do one with MEoDP</br></br>  <br>Well yeah, despite people posting it a lot as proof, it is just a doujinshi. A lot of things that happen there aren't how they should play out according to interviews, and even Crazy Clover admits they're bigger Tsuki fans so they tended to push that side in the first few issues before trying to dial it back near the end.<br><br>Which created its own problems as we had shit like Shirou having to be the one to take Prime Roa down, which was odd as well. Ciel outspeeding and beating Medusa who's on Bellerophon, when Ciel can match a servant with an average NP when she's fighting defensively at best, it made the Tsuki side really dominate early on in a bad way.<br><br>It was well drawn, a lot of shit really would not turn out like that, but as long as its taken for the doujinshi it is its fine. It will always have an odd rap since that's the doujinshi that launched a million power level discussions since Shikifans posted the Berserker page on a daily basis for a year or two as it always turned out the same way.<br><br>It's like an autism magnet</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And still no anime. Such a pity.</br>  <br>tfw when he is Archerkles.</br>  <br>I mean that originally, she looked more 'homely' and geeky. It was a good contrast with her real self as a professional killer. <br><br>New Ciel doesn't give me the same impression at all. She's too pretty.</br></br></br>  Do you think we will get an OP animated by a big studio?   2015 <br> People are still obsessed about granny Arc design. </br>  <br>It specifically says he saved a lot of people in a battle with his bow, so probably other guy.</br>  <br> a million power level discussions since Shikifans posted the Berserker page on a daily basis for a year or two as it always turned out the same way. <br>Proof that they are fucking cancer.</br></br>  <br>Hopefully Ufotable gets to do it.</br>  <br>The possibility exist.<br>they kinda look alike</br></br>  <br>It's a Gilgamesh-Shirou mashup</br>  <br> wanting ufotable to touch tsukihime after the shitshow that was F/SN:UBW </br>  <br>They're 1500 light years from Earth, but still within the virtual network.<br><br>However they're in the virtual network of another planet, since the Mooncell Network goes throughout the galaxy or more.<br><br>http://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthrea<wbr>d.php/3574-Fate-Extra-CCC-Translati<wbr>ons-SPOILERS?p=1273825&amp;viewfull=1#p<wbr>ost1273825<br><br>Just read it here</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not liking granny skirt </br>  <br>Herkules Main weapon was the Bow.</br>  <br>Doesn't Gilgamesh represent a part of Shirou anyway?</br>  <br>It doesn't fit his description at all though.</br>  <br>Arc is a pure!</br>  <br>Mostly about skirt really. <br>As  shows, it does have it's perks.

I doubt there are many anons who want to become heroes like Shirou.</br>  <br>I can't wait to see Redesign Shiki going fucking crazy<br>Bonus points for voice acting</br></br>  <br>They fucked up Rin's characterization in romantic scenes, making everything seem like a joke. Only the final episode handled her character well in that regard.</br>  <br>Why is Nanaya so sexual?</br>  <br>Fate/Stay Night is primarily focused on developing Shirou<br>Tsukihime is primarily focused on developing the heroines.<br>He just doesn't have as big of a presence.</br></br></br>  <br>He's the exact opposite of Shirou.<br>you self insert into Shirou<br>Shiki self inserts into you, overwriting your personality <br>you thought this was sick? now you love it<br>YOU LOVE IT</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She won't, but they changed her design probably because of that contrast.</br>  <br>It was better than the VN in most parts, and much better in some parts , but fanboys are fanboys.</br>  <br>You are in a Tsukihime thread, everyone here despises the UBW anime. Who do you think was shitposting on it the whole 2 seasons?</br>  <br>You should add CP to this.</br>  <br>KIMI TO</br>  <br>We never see her in her old skirt outside of Roa's flashback, though.</br>  <br>I would love if he was Maui or better Orion.<br>Orion would be one of the best Archers</br></br>  <br>DEAI</br>  <br>I don't have it on my HDD anymore. I can add it if you find a good profile shot of Saber.</br>  <br>WTF, Ufo? Zero had superior designs.</br>  <br>UBW 25 &gt; CP &gt;&gt; Prisma Ilya &gt; Anything else animated Type-Moon</br>  <br> Choreography <br>The majority of fights had good choreography<br><br> Rhinoses <br>Yeah the noses are terrible<br><br> Swordspam <br>What<br><br> CG water and Golems <br>The CG wasn't that bad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shiki will probably have a more clear cut personality in the remake. He'll be more of a character and less of a self-insert this time around.</br>    <br>I don't give a shit about the clothes. She could be naked for all I care, my main problem with it is the lack of hair intakes. I associate her with her hair style so it makes a world of difference on her design and how I perceive her. Specially now that Takeuchi faces are getting more and more alike. <br><br>Intakes = Arc<br>It's easy to fix it. See 2 - 4 here </br></br></br></br>  <br>They're not trapped, they can entirely explore the galaxy unrestrained. The data world has all the limitations and understandings as the real world basically, and its as expansive as the real thing. Mooncell can't stop them, and the virtual network is identical to the real thing.<br><br>The only ending where they actually escape the Mooncell is the CCC ending. Since Hakuno is just data he cannot get out of the Mooncell, he'll always just be data basically, and so he can only exist in the virtual network. His meat body on Earth is something else after all. Only with the AI's and your servant working together with some other miracles do you create a new future where Hakuno can reach the physical Earth along with one other.<br><br>However this is Hakuno's world, Hakuno is data, it's like saying "This 3D universe is no fun since we're trapped, confined to these flesh and blood bodies exploring this physical universe. We should be exploring a higher dimension universe instead". We that physically exist don't feel trapped, its not any different for him really. The data universe is just as good as the flesh universe.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shiki is Shioru in Soviet Russia</br>  <br> posting blank pictures </br>  <br>In UBW depends on who draw the scene. Tabata is bad yeah.<br><br>And Ikariya designs in Zero were fucking ugly all the time.</br></br></br>  <br> clear cut <br>Carlooooos</br></br>  <br> The majority of fights had good choreography <br>Webbum related.<br> &gt;Swordspam <br> What <br>Read the VN<br> The CG wasn't that bad. <br>It made A/Z look good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The CG was really noticeable. I'd prefer if they stick to using it for incomprehensible shit like Berserker.<br><br>Also, the fights in the second half of the show all had ass choreography with the exception being Shirou vs Gil.</br></br></br>  <br> The majority of fights had good choreography <br>Not really. Most of them were pretty average. It's just that special effect distract from and hide the errors and occasional QUALITY.</br></br>  <br> WTF <br>stop and no even zero design is shit with the sidemouth</br></br>  <br>Even I am gay for Nanaya</br>  <br>In KnK's defense, didn't each have different directors?</br>  <br> Wait they are siblings? So no arranged marriage or anything like that? <br><br>She likes him, like most of women in the Clock Tower, but Waver is gay. The only woman he show any glimpse of interest was Medusa when she reminded him to his husbando, Iskandar.<br><br>He only got aroused and get it up to Iskandar. Those girls are doomed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Archer v Lancer <br> ass choreography </br></br>  <br> ass choreography with the exception being Shirou vs Gil <br>Way to forget Rin v Luvia, the best fight in the show</br></br>  <br> tfw there will never be a TM anime/movie as good as KnK 5 <br><br>Why live?  Other than Tsukihime </br></br></br>  <br>Nero Chaos is such a stupid fucking name but I can't help but think it's cool.</br>  <br> The majority of fights had good choreography <br>eh no watch the scenes from prisma fights than you know what choreography is<br><br>not sure but the last one is from tabata but even that they start already with sidemouth in the epilogue movie 1 and 2 looks good though</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wanted to play this but I have being waiting for the remake.<br>Do you think the release is close or should I play the original?</br></br>  <br>Melty Blood HD Remake being released near/alongside tsukihime remake</br>  <br> Nero <br>That's now how you spell Nrvnsqr</br></br>  <br> Webbum related. <br><br>The Gil fight was better in the anime that in the VN.<br><br> Read the VN <br><br>I did. Shirou used UBW to counter GoB in the anime so I don't know what you're complaining about.<br><br> It made A/Z look good. <br>The CG was noticeable but it wasn't terrible.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Flat, obviously.</br>  <br>Should've kept the split bangs.<br><br>They were pretty much one of her defining features.</br></br></br>  Shiki is a power-fantasy for idiots. Like Rance but less funny.  <br>Well... at least it's not Grey or something. If Waver had ended with the Saber-clone I would have been mad.</br>  <br>It was too short for me and failed to capture the essence of the VN where Archer was getting completely btfo and was barely surviving by making false openings to extend his life against someone moving so fast he would vanish.<br><br>Overall, the first cour had the superior fights and choreography. Second cour was much more of a mixed bag.</br></br></br>  <br>Did they actually confirm voice acting in the issue?<br><br>I hope they keep the Melty actors. And the sex scenes .</br></br></br>  <br>It'll be 5 years at minimum before you can read the remake, just read the original now. The remake should be different enough that you'll want to go into it having read the original anyway.</br>  <br>He looked pretty good in the manga when his murderous murderer mode kicked in.</br>  <br> Power fantasy <br>More like an insanity fantasy</br></br>  <br>Actually it is</br>  <br> The Gil fight was better in the anime that in the VN. <br>this is fucking bullshit and he deflect most NP from gil with 2 swords by hand that even shouldn't happend</br></br>  <br>If this thread is anything to go by people would rather fuck Shiki than be him.</br>  <br> The Gil fight was better in the anime that in the VN. <br>It was better in the sense that it was more interesting to watch, but it completely missed the point of UBW and instead of showing why UBW it was better (show, don't tell), ufotable just had Shirou and Gil talk about it without showing why. It gave the impression that Shirou was simply stronger and faster at servant level than Gil.</br></br>  <br>Retards think it's the same thing because they think going insane will turn them into Joker.</br>  <br>I'm 90% sure Flat will end up with Grey.</br>  <br>Is that his redesign? Oh god, i just don't know anymore</br>  <br>No, it hasn't been confirmed.<br>Just being hopeful right now.</br></br>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br> implying you can't want both </br>  <br>Better than in the VN where they just fight close combat just because.</br>  <br>Oh I see, that sounds a bit better. As long as they aren't shut out by other Moon Cells (like firewall access or whatever) so they can explore freely and live their lives, it's not too bad. I'm still not sure why Gil wouldn't have a problem with it since he seems like the type to want his real body back.<br><br>Thanks for explaining.</br></br></br>  SOMEBODY MAKE CRAZY-SHIKI EDITS  <br><br>KnK was great, and you are a faggot.</br></br>  <br>I never knew TMfags were this gay for Shiki</br>  <br> just because <br>Just because it was the only way Shirou could properly utilize the advantage of UBW to beat a servant?<br><br>Did you even read the VN?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Who is Lu Sian again?</br>  <br><br>I know what you're saying but they have to make the fight entertaining to watch. If it was just Shirou and Gil swordspamming at each other until Shirou runs at Gil it would be pretty boring.</br></br>  <br>Waiting for Tsukihime for so long does weird shit to you.</br>  <br>According to Arc it is.</br>  <br>Nanaya shows up in every "Which male chracter would you fuck?" thread on /a/.</br>  <br>Yes and Gil doesn't use GoB at all? At least the anime tried to make sense of it by having the swords clashing for a while.</br>  <br>We've waited for his redesign for so long, getting to see it is comparable to an orgasm.</br>  is this remake going to bring on a age of cancerous shiki posting 12 times worse than all other type moon products combined?  <br>Gilgamesh is more excited than he's ever been<br><br>Seeing these alien worlds, this is what he dreamed humans would reach one day. In these new worlds even the Kingly AUO is nothing but a lowly Lv1 explorer, but his pioneering spirit is on fire at the moment, he speaks like a child going to Disney Land.<br><br>This is Nasu's favorite ending in the game as noted, it represents something big somehow about Nasu's own ideals or thoughts, and really brings something new to Gil's character.<br><br>Reaching the stars and going further, this is the dream.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>what is with the little brother of ajax?<br>Teucer he fits perfectly!</br></br></br></br>  <br>If he used UBW like that against any other Servant he would be wrecked though, something directly said in the VN.</br>  <br> If it was just Shirou and Gil swordspamming at each other until Shirou runs at Gil it would be pretty boring. <br>But that's exactly what happened.</br></br>  <br>Everyone becomes gay for Shiki once they go deep enough into Tsukihime. <br><br>At first you self-insert but then you start wanting Shiki to insert himself into you.</br></br></br>  <br> be fucked by Shiki* </br>  <br>His a blank slate with nothing even resembling a personality. I have never had a problem with that as I enjoy self inserting like the MC in good stories, but I won't pretend that he is a real character. Shikifags are just narcissistic pieces of shit that take self insertions way too far.</br>  <br>The bishounen above Flat.</br>  <br>JIBUN WOOOOOOOOOO</br>  <br> Nrvnsqr's head <br>What the fuck</br></br>  <br> Search that in google due to boredom <br> Get this <br><br>I guess it's true.</br></br></br></br>  <br>His cloak is that big because of all the shit he has in there</br>  <br>Gil uses it at the start of the fight, which was what Shirou was banking on to get into melee range.<br><br>Basically, the entire fight was one big chess battle with Shirou emerging on top. The anime dropped that part in favour of typical shounen beam/swordspam and superhuman Shirou.<br><br>Not saying it's better or worse, but I do prefer the VN.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Flat's "rival".</br>  <br>It's different computer networks as well, different Mooncells but the same network/internet perhaps.<br><br> “Do you not see? <br> The joy of learning the new. <br> The instinct that sets the heart aflutter in excitement when facing the unknown. <br><br> The entertainment that enlivens one’s existence――― <br> that is to say, something called ‘pleasure.’” <br><br> Spreading his arms wide, Gilgamesh indicates the city below. <br> A brand new world awaits there. <br><br> A world I’ve yet to see. <br> A future ahead of me, where I can push on and strive and run to my heart’s content, free of all constraints. <br><br> “You had quite the talent for worrying over matters, <br> but zilch for enjoying them. That won’t do at all. <br><br> Here in this alien world, like it or not, <br> you will undoubtedly come to know of the joy of living, the meaning of having been born. <br><br> After all, this is a new frontier even for me. <br> It’s impossible to not feel elated.” <br><br> With a grin, <br> Gilgamesh holds out his hand. <br><br> Though that grin of his is as callous as ever, <br> it’s filled with the exuberance of a pioneer. <br> This time the hand is not to shake, but rather an invitation to go forth together. <br><br> ―――I suppress a heartfelt sigh of exasperation. <br><br> Though I have no doubt I’ll be objecting in plenty later, <br> right now I can’t think of a single complaint. <br><br> For, as he says, before my eyes lies the “future”; <br> that which supersedes all else. <br><br> That’s the spirit. <br> Then let us dive into a new journey. <br><br> Our conquest is the sea of stars. <br> We shall sample the joys that humanity’ll one day learn of, Master!” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're not a true TM fan unless you want Shiki to fuck you. <br><br>My obscure source and limited knowledge of moon confirms Nasu agrees 100%. Believe me, I'm an expert.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Explain his hands</br>  will the remake have fucking though  <br>It is, you wasted your dubs</br>  <br><br> That fucking thread </br></br>  <br> The Gil fight was better in the anime that in the VN. <br>It looks cooler but is so over-the-top that it misses the entire point of the battle and why Shirou managed to beat Gil.</br></br>  <br>No</br>  <br>Shiki fucking you, yes.</br>  <br>but why</br>  <br>There's that one guy lately who hates it so much when someone calls Shiki an insert type, that he calls Shirou a self insert instead any time someone insults his husbando. Talks about how Shiki is so different and unique, and Shirou is the real non personality.</br>  <br><br>He tries to fit in</br></br>  <br>Highly unlikely.</br>    <br>The VN doesn't mention UBW vs. GoB spam even once.</br>  <br> In these new worlds even the Kingly AUO <br>Who?<br><br>And yeah, it does sound like a good part of Gil's character development. From what I've read, he gets a lot of development into someone who wants to see the human race advance to the point where they can reach the stars; he just has high standards. I think it also connects somewhat with Gaia's fear of humans outgrowing it. And of course, the implication that there lay much bigger things out there than humanity, which also ties into magi's obsession with the Root. All in all, when you put it that way, it really does seem like the logical conclusion of what Nasu has been building up to over this past decade.<br><br>Neat.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One-sided rivalry? <br><br><br><br>Why is Waver so perfect?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure it won't. Everything they said points to that.</br>  <br> remake <br>i didn't know there was a show to remake in the first place</br></br>  <br> How can they even do something similar to hisui/kohaku's routes without the sex? It's pretty important if I remember right </br>  <br>He's cute</br>  <br>Aanime onlys got the whole real vs fake thing and how UBW counters GoB. The exact specifics of the fight really don't matter.</br>  <br>Gilgamesh is sort of all about the results; he'll become the North Wind and punish humanity himself if he believes this will get better results than simply protecting them from harm.<br><br>He's not a Guardian, he's a parent, a parent that's willing to throw them into the Lions Den or push them out of the nest to see if they can grow all at once.<br><br>His methods are a bit extreme, but he does have good intentions somewhere.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is why I told you to reread the VN. In the very first part of the fight, after Shirou summons UBW, you see the CG for swordspam from the two sides. Right after, Shirou narrates himself rushing in to close the gap.<br><br>He used UBW to counter Gil's GoB (since Gil didn't understand the implications of UBW yet and was still dicking around) and once he got in, he then used UBW's fast sword creation ability to force Gilgamesh on the defensive. <br><br>It was brilliant.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What show? It's the VN you silly lad.</br></br>  <br> and all of the True Ancestors inherited a key imperfection of his - his hunger for blood <br>Did this plot point ever make sense to anyone else? How the hell does Crimson Moon Brunestud have an innate thirst for human blood if he's a being from the moon?</br></br>  <br> Aanime onlys got the whole real vs fake thing and how UBW counters GoB. <br>Yes, by having the characters fucking explain it, which is the worst way to handle both exposition and combat.</br></br>  <br>No<br> nothing so far has mentioned it <br> they've been removing themselves from the H scene for some time now <br> they even said they wouldn't be able to show their faces on the street if they made the remake an eroge now that TM's a respectable company <br><br>Not that they ever showed their face to begin with, but you know.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And afterwards the sword spam isn't mentioned again.<br>And in fact it's not even mentioned once.<br>The text only say that Shirou can draw his weapons faster than Gil.</br></br></br>  <br>Shiroumesh</br>    <br> How the hell does Crimson Moon Brunestud have an innate thirst for human blood if he's a being from the moon? <br>Crimson Moon didn't have a thirst for blood, just a taste for it. It never really hindered him unlike the True Ancestors.</br></br>  Did anyone remove Shiki's glasses yet?  <br>Yes</br>  <br> And afterwards the sword spam isn't mentioned again. <br>Yes, I know.<br><br>Which is why I said the swordspam happened at the beginning of the fight in response to you saying it didn't happen at all. What are you trying to argue, exactly? Or are you just back pedaling?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, that was really cool and made sense.<br><br><br> it made the Tsuki side really dominate early on in a bad way. <br><br>Yeah, that got fixed as time went on. It really wasn't the heroes who should have been subject to that, but the DAAs were handled accurately.<br><br> Shirou having to be the one to take Prime Roa down <br><br>It was really more like "essentially fucking everyone vs. Roa and him surviving for five issues while trolling." Besides Roa not being quite as flashy as he probably should be going by the manga and Meltan, I think they gave him a pretty fair shake. Shirou only added to the arsenal of shit everyone was throwing at him/ UBW did fucking nothing because Roa doesn't care about damage, but Rule Breaker and Avalon are what do him in. So I think that last fight was well done.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes and people have been talking about how gay they are for Shiki ever since. Read the thread</br>  <br>Waiting on a Mystic Eyes edit now</br>  <br>Clocktower is looking like a really fun place at this point.</br>  <br><br><br><br>I think it is "Le Chien" (the dog) and not Lu Sian. That's where the whole sniffing Gray comes from.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some of the other endings bring it home even harder, and bring together the meaning of what it means to be human along with that whole future thing.<br><br>This is the game that Nasu said was the meaning of basically all Fate stories to date at their core, it sort of brings forward one of the biggest themes.</br></br></br>  <br>Do I want to know why this Lu guy has wolf/cat ears?</br>  <br>No I'm saying it isn't mentioned in the VN while they fight in melee which implies that it doesn't happen</br>  <br>Wow.<br><br>Even I am gay for Shiki now.</br></br></br>  <br> exception being Shirou vs Gil. <br>That had no Choreography you retard. Holy shit buzzwords.<br> All ServantvsServant fights had good choreography. <br> ServantvsHuman fights didn't or had none <br>Oh gee I fucking wonder what message they were trying to send across.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> people are more excited for Shiki than for the girls <br><br>/a/ is evolving</br></br></br>  <br>I've always been gay for Shiki.</br>  Seems like they're going all out on this. I can't wait to see the glorious Tsukihime fight scenes with Mahoyo visuals and animation.<br><span>youtu.be/tLf9oWUe2fc  [ ]</br>  <br><br>I actually never heard of that before. Go on.</br></br>  <br> Not wanting to self-insert and then fuck yourself <br>Full retard.</br></br>  <br>The manga's Nero fight was probably some of the hypest shit I've ever read in a manga. <br>I've also probably never been so satisfied seeing something adapted so well.</br></br>  <br>Give me a picture with decent Mystic Eyes and I can make one.</br>  holy shit actual turkeyhandle remake news. <br><br>I thought type moon only did fate spin offs now.</br></br>  <br> implying they weren't gay for him to begin with  <br><br>Even I am starting to see the light.</br></br></br>  <br> Crimson Moon didn't have a thirst for blood, just a taste for it. It never really hindered him unlike the True Ancestors. <br>So True Ancestors run on Lamarckian inheritance theory?</br></br>  <br>See <br><br>He is probably a werewolf or something like Beo from Mahoyo.</br></br></br>  <br> The manga's Nero fight was probably some of the hypest shit I've ever read in a manga. <br>You don't read much manga, do you?</br></br>  <br>If you don't want to fuck every single person in the Tsukihime VN you're a casual and not a true fan. <br><br>Nero can shark me anytime.</br></br></br>  I feel they're going to ruin it with tons of nasuverse sperg shit and info dumps of it, the original was fine with the mininal ammount.    <br> You don't read much manga, do you? <br>You read a lot of shonenshit, don't you.</br></br>  <br> &gt;they even said they wouldn't be able to show their faces on the street if they made the remake an eroge now that TM's a respectable company <br> Nitro+ is a respectable company and they still make Eroge. </br></br>  <br>Same here. I'm not even sure why I was so hyped for it. <br><br><br>You can always search up how they look on Nanaya in case you're not in the mood to go all sparkly ufotable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Re-read the original, it's got more infodumps than you remember  of course not as much as F/SN .</br>  <br>Ah, I thought you meant it wasn't used at all, which is wrong considering not only do they show you the CG, they play the sound effect too.</br>  <br>Turn his eyes this colored blue and give him a smirk</br>  <br>That was also the whole reason why Gil gave the middle finger to the gods and cut humanity ties with them (and then Enkidu, who was made to bring the gods to humanity, basically helped Gil to bring humanity to the gods level).</br>  <br>You can make it like here </br>  <br> they even said they wouldn't be able to show their faces on the street if they made the remake an eroge now that TM's a respectable company <br>I still don't ever remember them saying that.</br></br>  <br>Do this one without glasses</br>  <br>Gil is selfish, and needs to own everything.<br>Shirou is selfless, and only takes ideas.<br>Even so, Gilgamesh does what he thinks is best for his people, even in UBW.</br></br></br>  Hisui's cuteness is a miracle of the multiverse.  WHERE ARE THE LEN REDESIGNS  <br> More like an insanity fantasy <br>This is exactly what Edgy teenagers love.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, CCC sounds like Nasu's magnum opus for Fate. I hope it gets translated someday - I'm sure a lot of TM fans would love to read it.</br>  <br>Not him, but I saw someone trustworthy source it recently. Can't find it for the life of me now.</br>  <br>I'll hate Takeuchi if he ruins the cutest thing in the universe.</br>  <br>AUO is Gilgamesh's nickname with Japanese fans, that was directly referenced in CCC a few times.<br><br>King of Heroes when spelled out sounds a lot like the English letters AUO. Even Gilgamesh can't help calling himself that one once.</br></br></br>  <br> Nitro+ <br> respectable company <br> literally Grasshopper Manufacture of VNs </br></br></br>  <br> This shit has so many bs scenes.. <br>Actually, after Nasu explained that the MEoDP can kill Servants and all spiritual bodies, it didn't seem so BS anymore.</br></br>  I don't remember Shiki being this expressive. <br><br>Can't wait for that personality boost.</br></br>  <br>Gilgamesh is portrayed as the villain because he comes from a different era with a different set of morals and social responsibilities. You see this in the Feast of Kings, where he basic says that the King is above all else... but the onus is on the king to truly do what's good for his people and be benevolent.</br>  <br>I think I could deal with the skirt, but I really have a problem with that Saber hair. Both take something away from her unique personality.</br>  <br> KT remake never <br> MB remake never </br></br>  <br>I remember when /a/ lost its shit over this scene.<br><br>Good times.</br></br></br>  <br>I bet on Odysseus</br>  <br>No it's still BS.</br>  <br> I don't remember Shiki being this expressive.  <br>Dude what?</br></br>  <br>Melty blood remake is a thing, anon<br>French Bread wanted to do it, but Nasu was "busy" with mahoyo<br>French bread makes Under-night instead<br>Nasu says he would be very happy if they were to release the MB remake alongside the turkeyhandle remake</br></br></br></br>  <br> Shikifans posted the Berserker <br>That one isn't really that crazy.<br>Arcueid who is literally stronger than Berserker, is keeping Berserker occupied.<br>Then Shiki shows up with MEoDP, which Nasu said can kill Servants.<br><br>So that scene isn't really wrong.<br><br><br>Redesign Shiki is literally MBAA Nanaya with an ahoge.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>MEoDP can kill anything.</br>   people actually hyping CCC <br><br>It's actually just mostly garbage, guys.<br><br>Some of the concepts at play are interesting, but the overall narrative is honestly pretty stupid and insanely hard to take seriously.<br><br>Whenever Nasu is actually expanding the setting, it sounds cool enough, but the way most of the concepts are used in the plot itself too often just go full retard.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Smug a best</br>  <br> Then Shiki shows up with MEoDP, which Nasu said can kill Servants. <br>Threadly reminder that he was referring to Ryougi's eyes, not Tohno's.</br></br>  <br> MEoDP can kill anything besides for things without a concept of death <br>FTFY.</br></br>  <br>Can't ryougi kill crazy shit like concepts and stuff?</br>  <br>I've seen that Nasu said something along the lines of 'wouldn't i be cool if there was a MB remake' which doesn't really give me an awful lot of hope.<br>And I've seen 'he was busy with Mahoyo' before, but never a source to back it up.</br></br>  <br>Yep. She can kill anything she considers alive.</br>  <br>Oh shut up you shitty wanker.</br>  <br>No, he referred to all Shikis when he wrote that bit.</br>  <br> being an EoP <br>He was referring to both Shikis.</br></br>  <br>But anon, Shikifags are the only ones that dont selfinsert in Shiki</br>  <br> without glasses <br>But I can't remove glasses.</br></br>  <br> no FKMT-esque mugshot </br>   Shikifags wanking their self-insert <br>Kek</br>  <br>Is Nero really strong enough that Arc never wants to have to fight him?</br>  <br><br>Nope, he specifically singled out Ryougi as a servant-killer.<br><br>Feel free to prove me wrong with a citation though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd let Shiki kill me anytime.</br>  <br> Threadly reminder that he was referring to Ryougi's eyes, not Tohno's. <br>Wrong. If you read it in Japanese, the question of "Shiki" is in katakana, applying it to all the Shikis.<br><br>If he were to simply think it was Ryougi the questioner was talking about, he wouldn't have done two things:<br><br>1. Use katakana for Shiki, because Ryougi Shiki's Shiki has a kanji of its own.<br>2. Refer to MEoDP so generally in the answer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's a pain in the ass since she really can't kill him without access to 100% of her power.</br>  <br>Read </br>  <br>No he singled out Ryougi as an example that she has killed spiritual beings before. Also see </br>  <br>He's really annoying and has some stupid powers.</br>    <br>That's old stuff</br>  <br>You know that nero dont really have a form in reality, right?</br>  <br> applying it to all the Shikis. <br>Then he goes and specifically mentions only Ryougi and her version of the eyes in his answer while completely leaving out Tohno. He was dodging the question.<br><br>Like I said, feel free to post the citation and we'll see why you're wrong.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No Gil is a villain because he wants to kill 99% of all humans</br>  Would Shiki and Shinji be good friends?  <br>He only refers to Ryougi as an example. Because there are three other users of the MEoDP, both Shikis.<br>Or is he supposed to make an example for the other two Shikis as well? Of course not.<br>That is the reason he used katakana for "Shiki" and then used Ryougi as an example using her lastname. <br><br>EOP.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://www.4gamer.net/games/128/G01<wbr>2841/20121101001/</wbr></br>  <br> shinji's ending in ubw is having consensual sex with sakura forever </br>  <br>He was about to absorb Arc when Shiki attacked.<br>That would have resulted in something rather "bad" for everyone<br> besides Fabro </br></br></br>  <br> He only refers to Ryougi as an example. <br>When answering the question, he refers specifically to Ryougi's eyes with her also as his example.<br><br> EOP. <br>I'm starting to get the feeling you're the EOP here, since you refuse to post the source so we can see what Nasu said. Or perhaps you don't even have it? Exposed as an EOP?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shiki would beat the crap out off Shinji and fix his faggot ways</br>  <br>Are you implying that 100% Arc can kill a planet?<br>He's basicaly impossible to kill</br></br>  <br> It's like Ataraxia in a sense<br><br>It's some comedy type stuff, and some serious world building on top of it as it all weaves together a bit better than Ataraxia did. Even some nice tear jerker scenes to go with it. Good game over all with a lot to take away from it from what I've read of it so far, which is mostly just one route. Every character is pretty good or fun this time around, and has some fleshing out. Even a nice bitter sweet ending that's kind of painful.<br><br>Even reading one route can tell me your statement is just your opinion that goes a bit far rather than the fact you're making it out to be. You might not think its anything good, just like how a lot of people think Fate is absolute shit and Tsukihime was the only good story, but that's pretty much a nothing statement.<br><br>It has taken on a lot of hype that might be harmful in the long run if it ever does get translated, but for me it was entirely worth it and more.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How old is Nero Chaos?</br>  <br>What do you mean fix his ways? They can bond over raping girls together.<br> Nasu will never write a scene where Shiki and Shinji run a train on the maids </br></br>  <br>You're talking about [ ] being able to fight Servants. All MEoDP versions are effective against Servants, not all users can actually stab Servants.</br>  reminder that the anime ruined her hair<br>also<br> deleting threads </br></br>  Reminder that Kevin promised us Noah this year.<br> deleting threads with ontopic discussion </br>  <br>we discussed VNs, not animu<br>seems like that makes a thread worthy of deletion<br> despite the fact that literally any discussion on /a/ ends up going back to the source material </br></br></br>  Chaos;Head has an anime adaption, although it's so shitty, anyone who watches it before reading the source is to be pitied.<br>Steins;Gate has an anime adaption, which sadly cut a few character's development but is good as an entry into the series.<br>Robotics;Notes has an anime adaption, which served for a gateway for many to the C;H VN, back when it aired.<br>Chaos;Child will get an anime adaption, we will see how this will play out.<br><br> deleting threads when discussing source material <br>In this case half of the /a/ catalog should be deleted.<br><br>Especially Yahari and Fate threads.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nah, its because mods only look at the OP to decide which threads to delete now.</br>  I'd like to see this picture with the words "anal penetration" added to the bottom.  Let's predict who /a/ will call a slut and who they'll call best girl in Chaos;Child.  <br> so close to quads <br>if you had gotten them, I would honestly have done it  for you </br></br>  <br>thats possible, the other one had a meme OP (from the anime) as well, and yet it went to the bump limit, whereas the deleted one had a meme OP from the VN</br>  <br>I once posted a S;G OP with a screenshot of the Novel, civil discussion in the thread, yet it was deleted.<br><br>The mods are fucking incompetent.</br></br></br>  <br> Complaining about 4chan <br><br>try not breaking the rules when making shit thread OP</br></br></br>  <br>You get what you pay for with moderation.</br>  to the anon that wanted me to edit the OP from the previous thread, if you are still here.<br>Is this better?<br> dat low resolution on the text, but cba to replay the VN until that point again. (dont even remember exactly where it was) </br></br>  <br> low resolution on the text <br>Isn't that part of the joke? Or is it just convention?</br></br>  <br>It's perfect, nice job. The low res is part of the meme.</br>  Does SG has the best VN art ever? I'm amazed at how good it is given VN's re known for their shitty art.  <br>Who the hell is this?</br>  <br>well, I didnt really think about that when I first mashed it together, I just found it funny and made it in a hurry.<br><br>no problem :)<br><br>Its because the colours are less "full" in a sense, also the details in the backgrounds are great IMO. And ofc<br> Huke eyes. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its Kevin, the new sciADV thread meme</br>  <br>Personally, I prefer the Chaos;Child art.<br><br>Kevin, an employee of PQube, the company that brought Steins;Gate to Vita in Europa and NA.</br></br></br>  <br>It varies, just as with any medium. There's some brilliant pixel art in some of the older VNs. huke is brilliant though.</br>  <br>Well huke's art is not for everyone. Personally I love it</br>  I've been meaning to ask: how do you actually pronounce "huke"?  <br>I pronounce it HOO-kay</br>  <br>whokeh</br>  <br>Yeah, it's great, it's got personality. I even got so used to Huke's drawings that I couldn't watch the anime. The new designs felt wrong.</br>  <br>Choco got better with time.<br>Check Dual cover</br></br>  <br>Literally every single one of them has better hair colours in this one than in the original game.<br> a fucking street sign captcha </br></br>  Is there a kind anon out there willing to share this theme with me?  <br>Redrawing new sprites is pretty expansive, isn't it?</br>  <br>Yeah, especially with the blinking and talking animations</br>  I'm gonna marry Kurisu!  <br>fight me.</br>    <br>It would have been nice.<br>Maybe ten years from now on.<br>Like Ever17 ( even if they used a 3d animation, for what purpose )</br></br></br>  Why is she so perfect?  <br>Not even science can explain it</br>    <br>Reminder anime broke the eyes too.</br>    <br>She was written that way.</br>  Kurisu is cute!

Why bombard me like that</br></br></br></br>  <br> After many thousands of D-Mails and Time Leaps, Geralt of Okarinvia decides enough is enough </br>  <br>second best girl though.<br> Plays vidya, knows memes, is caring, has strong beliefs. </br></br>  http://gematsu.com/2015/06/steins-g<wbr>ate-ps3-ps-vita-us-release-date-set<wbr></wbr></wbr>  <br> dat ahegao </br>  <br> almost nothing of worth <br> except a lot of the world-building and exposition, also foreshadowing. </br></br>  So, guys?<br><br>Whose eyes are those eyes?<br>If those eyes are god's eyes, who is the new god?</br></br></br>  <br>Even though I got introduced to Steins;Gate 2 years ago through the anime. I feel the same way after reading the VN last week and watching the OVA earlier today. <br><br>Wish there were more of Suzuha in the VN though. Her design is amazing.</br></br></br>  <br> what is pacing <br> what is fucking your ignorant shit up and subjecting you to all the psychological torment that Okabe must be experiencing </br></br>  <br>tutturuu~</br>  <br> murifats BTFO again <br><br> Takumi? </br></br></br>  <br>far left, then probably second from left or middle. possibly right. 3 and 4 seem too generic for them to appeal in either direction.</br>  <br>I misread that as ahoge before looking at the image. Now I can't unsee what looks like an ahoge emanating from the bottom right of the image.</br>  <br>Every time I see this I always think about how painful it is, and then start thinking about the one new gen with the itching, the spider like itching. That get's me a little.</br>  <br> Takumi was obviously the one with the eyes in C;H, both of them in fact. <br>But I am talking about the Chaos;Child "Those eyes are god's eyes".<br><br> Takumi doesn't have godly powers anymore, so who is god? </br></br></br></br>  <br>I like how long her arms are. Makes her look super athletic</br>  <br>Most will love Serika because she's the main. /a/ will call Hana a slut the most because she looks and acts like one. Simple.</br>  <br>Boys make the best girls so it's not fair to consider Ruka</br>  <br>She must be, being a resistance fighter and all. <br> You remember the fight scenes in the VN where she practically beats up 4 or 5 rounders by herself, right? <br><br> Ruka <br> not Luka <br> implying that is Luka to begin with </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course, man. Suzuha is my second favorite girl to Kurisu. She definitely has the most heart</br>  <br>Out of the S;G ones I would have to agree with you, although Sena and Yua are contenders if we count C;H.</br>  <br> what is fucking your ignorant shit up and subjecting you to all the psychological torment that Okabe must be experiencing <br>Fuck, yeah. I can almost say I felt what he was feeling at that moment.</br></br>  <br> She definitely has the most heart <br>This reminds me of a certain box with the description "With heart".<br><br>Thank you for triggering me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Have you played her bad end yet? It's an awesome read, even thought it's a bit silly.<br><br>I recall not even realizing having selected the "No D-Mail" option. Minutes later I was freaking the fuck out, wondering what the hell was going on. Now it's probably the section of the VN that I remember the most.</br></br></br>  <br> Yua <br>But, anon, Yua is dead since before the start of the story.<br><br>Do you mean Mia?<br><br>And if we include Chaos;Head, Rimi and Ayase win everything.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Moeka is the best girl in S;G. This is an established fact.  By SERN   <br>As in, Ever 17 got a remake with new sprites and I just somehow have not heard, or you want Ever 17 to get a remake with new sprites?</br>  <br>She's got best body, but that's it</br>  <br>Her route in Phenogram was sad. I wish it could've been canon. ;_;</br>  <br>I see it too now. Fuck you.</br>  <br>Ever17 got a remake but with R;N 3D engine.<br>Bleah.</br></br>  <br>That picture reminds me of Akuma no Riddle.</br>  <br>"Yua"s personality then I guess you could say. Their outward appearances are literally the same either way.</br>  <br> not even realizing having selected the "No D-Mail" option. <br>I found myself in the same situation as I didn't realize that the "action symbol" was significant at first and thought I had gotten that ending based on my mails.</br></br>  <br>She's kind of a bitch but I can't hate her.</br>  <br>Well, I only know that Daru said a certain "Knight-Hart" was looking for the IBN to help the crew.</br>  <br> Their outward appearances are literally the same either way. <br>Nope, they are not.<br> One has a mole on her Breast, one does not. </br></br></br>  <br> Who's to say it's not Takumi? He's role in the events of C;H caused the effects of C;C, be it indirectly. </br>  <br> Play for hours <br> Forget the game's theme was actually rather grim <br> Suddenly this happens <br>I couldn't believe it in the beginning. I think that's what they were going for while making it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Takumi loses his powers, he is not god anymore. <br><br>Come to think of it, what are the active Gigalomaniacs at the end of Chaos;Child?<br> Just the ones from Chaos;Head minus Takumi, yes? </br></br></br></br>  <br> No actual rape <br>Are there any doujins about it? It's looks like a great inspiration for H material. Anyway, nothing really hapened, so hurray for Okarin's sanity, I guess.<br><br>Also, I just remembered how I hated the mail system. It was so stupid, a tiny mistake at the beginning would prevent you from getting the True End. And since there isn't a skip mode, that means having to replay everything in Auto mode. So stupid.</br></br></br></br>  <br>but there literally is a skip mode.</br>  <br>You can't even go back once Okabe's written a reply, which is terrible because you have to guess what he's going to say each time.<br><br> tfw being a dick to everyone by mistake <br><br>I-I hope they can take the banter</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This makes me regret watching the anime back when I did.</br>  <br>I don't want to be mean.<br>http://exhentai.org/g/558533/635d5d<wbr>6c12/</wbr></br></br>   finally get to read the VN <br> got Faris end on first try <br>Sweet<br> Luka's end on second try <br>No. Fuck this shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure, maybe that's what it's called. But it's not really a skip mode. A skip mode doesn't waste 20 minutes of your time.</br>  <br>So between your two options, you chose the slower one?</br>  <br>Do you have a problem with the Luka end?</br>  <br>Per convergence, even that ends bad</br>  <br>Ever17 got a remake with ugly 3D sprites and a revisionist story that pandered to all the popular fan theories to make them canon.<br>Tsugumi got a NEW DRESS for the Kid routes.<br>Yubiseiharukana was  secretly the mastermind <br>Sara was  actually in LeMU as a Leiblich assassin to kill Tsugumi (under Dr. You Tanaka's orders). She only jokes about joking about being a ninja. <br>Game enforces you to play Takeshi's perspective before Kid's, but on the bright side, it cuts out redundant scenes.<br>You get to unlock the  BW Route  after you've finished the rest of the story.  The BW Route covers the 17 years between the story and how Yubiseiharukana, Sora, and Kaburaki went about planting seeds of revolt against Leiblich and plotting the 2034 incident with antimatter 4D-summoning bullshit machines. Also somehow Deus ex Machina's Blick Winkel into all the bad endings so that they actually converge into the Coco Epilogue so nobody ever actually dies in any timeline. <br>Sara ending is rewritten so that  Kid and Sara don't swim to safety but instead escape through the same gondola they were conceived in. Kind of gross if you think about it too much. <br>The seemingly dropped plot point about Sora's terabyte disk  culminates in Sora being downloaded into Pipi during the 17 years as a portable terminal <br><br>I wish I was making some of this up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wasn't really expecting an answer, honest, but still, cool, I'd forgotten about this one.<br><br><br>Oh, fuck, was there really a literal skip button?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Oh, fuck, was there really a literal skip button? <br>Press ctrl.</br></br>  <br> What is CTRL </br>  <br>Control ?</br>  <br>Also cropped CG and cut BGW</br>  <br><br><br>...Oh. Well, that's what I meant. But that still took a bunch of time. I remember eating in the meantime while the text was skipping. Besides, I had to pay attention to when the calls were going to pop up, since I didn't know the exact time they appeared.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't know if it's what he's talking about but crtl went through text really fast. Would have preferred instant skipping instead of all the waiting.</br>  Are there CGs for the old Di-Swords?  <br>Why the hell did my post get deleted?</br>  Is it just me, or is the text skip speed in the console versions hella faster than the PC version? Shitty Nitro+ port strikes again?  Fucking Rei Hiroe having gifted us.      <br>Too many memes, cannot decrypt</br>  <br>Hiroe drew this? <br><br>Now if he could just get to Black Lagoon. Lazy bastard.</br></br></br>  <br><br>What am I reading?</br></br>  <br>Manga</br>  HEY MISTER  <br> Word to your mother </br>  <br>I'm very conflicted about how to feel.</br>  Why should I be hyped for S;0 when Kurisu is going to be a computer program with no knowledge of any of the characters? In that situation, she'll probably have barely any important screen time, if any at all.  <br>The VN up to that point could've still gotten away with STERN conpiracy being made up by chuuni part of Okarin and the assault felt a bit out of the blue, but it was still quite obvious something will happen at one point or other.</br>  <br> implying Okabe won't be talking to her obsessively </br>  <br> implying there won't be a wAIfu end </br>  <br> not getting hyped for Okabe suffering </br>    <br> wAIfu end <br>My sides.<br>So, all he will do is just hugging the monitor?</br></br></br>  <br> wAIfu <br><br>Ayy lmao</br></br></br>  I'll be honest /a/, I  just finished watching the show. <br>Is it worth reading through the VN knowing the plot? </br>   <br>Yeah, it's still worth it</br>  <br>Yes. I've already read the VN and I'm rereading it at the moment, and it's still sending chills down my spine as I read through the tenser scenes.</br>  <br>Yes. The VN goes more in depth into things, and has multiple routes other than True End</br>  <br>You can get the other endings. The show ruins Mr. Braun's and Nae's story so you can see what actually happened with them.</br>  <br>Chapters 7-9 (of 11) are completely glazed over in the anime.</br>  <br>Do it for Okabe's native level English.</br>    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>All right, I thought so. Haven't checked since I'm literally shitterposting, is it in nyaa?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Since the thread pictured just happened last night, it must exist. <br>You probably have to move to Russia.</br></br>  <br>Yes. That's how I did it.</br>  <br>Grab it on Vita if you can! You know you want to.</br>  <br>The action symbol only appeared for me after I played through the suzuha end. <br>When I restored my save to where the decision had to be made so I could continue with the story, it was suddenly there.</br></br>  <br>I don't have a vita, never really thought it would be worth it. It seems like most of the best releases on it are VNs and I don't read many VNs.</br>  <br>Vita has some neat games though.</br>  <br>besides the Kurisu end and the true end, it is the easiest possible thing to choose what end you get.</br>  <br>There are some great Vita titles. I picked up Gravity Rush the other day, and then there's P4G. It's a great system for JRPG's and VN's, though</br>  <br>One of the best parts of the VN was getting a simple text message, probably Mayuri begging for more bananas, when its actually an anonymous text with an image of blood red jelly attached and then Okabe's internal paranoia.</br>     reading Suzuha's end for the first time <br> groundhog day without the comedy <br> then he looks at Suzuha's body <br><br>AY WHAT THE FUCK OKABE</br></br></br></br>  I'm really enjoying the number of people in these threads reading the VN for the first time. The staggered release between EU and NA will keep this trend up a lot longer, I think!  <br> wAIfu </br>  <br><br>...demo, otoko da.<br><br> MFW I'd probably be okay with either version </br></br></br></br>  <br>Indeed</br>  Quick!<br>Translate<br> その目だれの目  into every language you know!<br><br> Whose eyes are those eyes? <br> Wessen Augen sind diese Augen? <br> Hi oculi cuius oculi sunt? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> demo </br>  <br>I want to take away her phone and hate-rape her.</br>  <br>I've seen a lot of PG-13 rape scenes and let me tell you,<br>that one was top.</br></br>  <br><br>N-no!

Pretty good, all things considered.<br><br>Now I just have Feris' and Lukako's.<br><br>How good are they compared to the others?</br></br></br></br>    <br>Luka's ending is horseshit, while Faris' is a great one.</br>  <br> not a guy <br>dropped</br></br>  <br>Haven't gone through Luka's route yet, does his ending have him as a girl? I really hope it doesn't.</br>  <br><br>那些眼是谁的眼？</br></br>  <br>Of course it does have him as a girl, the ending is reached by not canceling the D-Mail that made him into a girl.</br>  <br> &gt;Bu gözler kimin gözleri? </br>  <br>oh<br>right<br>I should probably think before I post</br></br></br>  <br><br>Faris' ending is nice.

So far the only method I've determined is to click on the keyword, send its text, and then reload until I've gotten the one I've decided is best. It works but it seems autistic. Also is ignoring someone's email just as much of a decision as replying to it?<br><br>Mayushii is best girl (so far)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are unfortunately unable to preview your answers before sending them, sometimes making it so that you become an asshole when you didn't really want to be one.<br><br>Also, ignoring calls/messages can impact the story.</br></br></br>  <br><br>also forgot to say, Kurisu best girl.</br></br>  <br>There's no way to know what you're going to send without reloading<br>The only emails that matter for the endings are Kurisu ones. One trigger and you'll get normal Kurisu ending, five and you'll get the true end, zero and you'll get Mayushii. Other endings are triggered by not sending a mail that changes the past.</br></br>  <br>There are still alternate scenes throughout the story that can be gotten from ignoring phone calls/sending different messages etc.</br>  <br>It's a pain in the ass at least for "Whose eyes" part.<br>The same can be said for a Spanish equivalent</br></br>  <br><br>I would look up an ending guide for the routes.

That has a lot of potential for branching paths.</br>  <br>What, don't you know how to use Photoshop?</br>  <br>eh, Im pretty sure that if you mention S;G outside of these specific threads then you are atleast going to have SOMEONE point out that it is shit and overrated.<br>Also, it would not surprise me if quite a few of them criticizing it over on /v/ are anime-only, and while I do agree that the anime is good, the VN is still superior.</br></br>  <br>pic related</br>  <br>Oh no, however will I recover my anonymous honor?</br>  <br>Hopefully people will finally recognize that his name is Luka, and not Ruka like the anime made it out to be.</br>  <br>Well they are pronounced the same way aren't they?</br>  <br>More people know since the VN release.<br>It's just one of those things, like people who still use Congroo and think Luka is trans.</br></br>  <br>I think he meant in meme font</br>  <br>I don't speak moon, but they do sound kinda similar. However, Ruka just feels "wrong" to me, maybe just because Luka = Luke, even I highy doubt that they were thinking of that when they made his name.<br><br/></br></br>  <br>I would also like to know this.</br>  <br>They're all connected.<br>https://sites.google.com/site/scien<wbr>ceadventureseries/home/the-science-<wbr>adventure-series<br><br>Chaos;Head Noah is untranslated (but may be getting a release soon) and the anime is fucking garbage.<br>Robotics;Notes is untranslated and the anime is mediocre.<br>Chaos;Child is untranslated and will be getting an upcoming anime.</br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>You mean Impact?</br>  <br>I assume that he wanted it in the same font as the text from the VN.

I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Baka Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret hackings on SERN, and I have over 300 confirmed kills (entire Commitee of 300). I am trained in time travel warfare and I’m the top scientist in the entire Imperial Japanese Armed Forces. You are nothing to me but just another mad scientist. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, bakabakashi. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the world and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, baka. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, baka. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Glorious Nippon Time Machine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little bakabakashi. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn hentai. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</br>  <br> I've been involved in numerous secret hackings on SERN <br><br>Liar, everyone knows you sold out to SERN to protect your mother.</br></br></br>  <br>Didn't she sell out to save Mayuri as well?</br>  <br>S-stop it baka! Stop spouting filthy lies about me!</br>  <br>Mayuri died, so no.</br>  <br>That's what I meant, she wanted to create the time machine so Daru could copy it and Suzuha could go back to the past to save Mayuri.</br>    <br>Sauce on that? Never heard this before</br>  <br> mfw I look like this + glasses </br>  <br> implying I'm lying <br><br>You're really good putting on the tough chick act, but that facade crumbles real quick once you're confronted with the fact that you're a liar and a coward.</br></br></br>  <br>Why does Mayuri look like a Grandma?</br>  <br>Maybe she becomes a kindergarten teacher?</br>  <br>She does in the Steins Gate, but not in Beta.</br>  <br> She does in the Steins Gate <br><br>Wait, seriously? I was just talking out my ass</br></br></br>  <br>Yes. By 2015 in the Steins Gate she's a kindergarten teacher.</br>  Just picked up the final volume  <br>What's this from?

I don't remember seeing this</br>  <br>From the cancelled actual sequel.<br>It was going to focus on Nae and the state of Okabe &amp; co in 2015.<br><br><br>Is a recent picture from the artist that would've worked on it.</br></br></br></br></br>  reminder about who is best girl.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qUs<wbr>4d4t9glc</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Canceled novel</br>  <br><br>Huh, didn't know that was going to be a thing. I'd rather have something in Beta like they're doing with 0, though. I thought the true end of S;G wrapped everything up perfectly and that there didn't have to be anything beyond that.<br><br>Besides, they tried doing that with the anime and most of /a/ seems to hate the OVA</br></br></br></br>  <br>Preaching to the choir, friend-o</br>  <br>The OVA and Movie weren't written by the original authors. This would've been penned using proper concepts and 5pb involvement.<br>I'm disappointed since it was going to bridge the time between Steins;Gate and Robotics;Notes, and have Nae learn the truth about her parents.</br></br>  <br> it was going to bridge the time between Steins;Gate and Robotics;Notes, and have Nae learn the truth about her parents. <br><br>Okay, that actually sounds kind of cool.</br></br></br>  <br>But....she's a girl in that timeline</br>  <br>The OVA was great although it goes against the creators' original vision.<br><br>The movie goes against all that is right and should be burned.</br></br></br>  <br>I liked the OVA, too, personally -- more for the character interactions than anything.<br><br>As for the movie,  it gave us drunk Kurisu and nightwear Kurisu, so I can't hate it no matter how much I want to. And I want to hate it. </br></br></br>  <br>Moeka above Daru? For what reason</br>  <br>The movie is just a bunch of Kurisu fanservice that makes no sense plotwise tbh.<br> it did give us this though, so I am willing to forgive it somewhat. </br></br>   The anime OPs are always the best in my opinion , so I can't wait for the C;C and SG Zero animes.  <br>That is just wrong and you know it.  Atleast for S;G, don't know if there is a different OP for the C;H anime, and I have neither watched nor read R;N </br>    <br>Animation wise sure.<br>I do like the anime RN ones more than SG.<br><br>Ending wise is another matter</br></br></br></br>  <br>C;H anime's opening is called F.D.D and is one of the very few good things about it.<br><br>R;N anime's openings are called Junjou Spectra and Houkyou no Messiah, and are both awesome.</br></br></br>  <br> Favourite VN for execution <br> Chaos;Head <br>Which execution?</br></br></br>  <br>Must admit slight kek</br>  <br>Vampire House a best.</br>  <br><br><br>Fuck, they did take it down. Where can I upload this shit again?</br></br></br>  Finished the VN a couple of days ago. One thing I didn't get is how Daru became a lab member in the worldline where moe didn't exist in Akiba. Okabe said the only reason Daru bothered to become one is because the maid cafe was close by, so what convinced Daru?  <br>F.D.D was pretty good, similar to Hacking to the Gate, unsure if I like it or "Find the Blue" more though.<br>Junjuou Spectra sounds great, a bit more uptempo and as much as I hate to use that word, "badass". Also liked that they threw in that small nod to C;H in there.<br>Houkyou no Messiah sounded a bit more generic, but not bad by any means.<br><br>By the way, what is the name of the R;N VN OP? Not gonna play the VN itself until a translation is out because EOP for life, but just for comparison.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably convergence, to some extent. Also Faris lives pretty close and apparently they meet up and play RaiNet once in a while.</br>  <br>There's Augmented Place and The Promised Augment.</br>  <br>Suzuha's phenogram route, although I realize that's not canon it sounds fine in context.</br>  <br>thanks anon. Listening to these OPs has given me motivation to get started on R;N soon, need to finish my Monogatari marathon tho, currently still only on Nise.  Sengoku best girl, and best seiyuu as well </br>  <br>I guess so. It's still kinda weird how even on that wordline, Okabe still recalled the maid cafe as being the reason for Daru becoming a lab mem and not realising that couldn't be it.</br>  <br>The original version of R;N for PS3 and 360 had an OP called Augmented Place.<br><br>Robotics;Notes Elite, the upgraded version for Vita, had an OP called Augmented Promise.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tlZ<wbr>CyrjdqUk</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1kF<wbr>IqlWq2Ts</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  http://vocaroo.com/i/s0Ue9yojxHxV<br><br>DONT FUCKING WORRY I'VE GOT THIS SHIT BOYS</br></br>  <br>weren't they classmates and quite good friends either way?

Usually just ends up with me buying a crapload of it if I happen to go somewhere that sells it for the  memes , and then leave it in the fridge for months because I never cba to actually drink a lot of it. <br><br>I did start eating more Haagen-Dasz (spelling?) icecream after watching Kara no Kyoukai though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's so hot outside, don't you want to go buy a big chilled bottle of Dr. Peppah and share it with KURISTINA right now?  <br>I can accept Dr Pepper, but Hagen Dasz is the worse shit ever.</br>  <br>because it is 12 degrees Celsius outside and raining right now where I live.<br>A perfect day for being inside and creating future gadgets though!  or just shitposting </br></br>  <br>Because dr peper is shit.

If KyoAni were to reach the point where a relationship would have been affirmed, would they affirm it?</br>  <br>Played in band in school for basically as long as that's possible, up until my second year of university, I quite liked a lot of it for band stuff but I think it was perhaps a bit too idyllic in some regards. Maybe that's because when it came to band for me, there were never a huge number of people who really wanted to be good. We WERE good and that was all. The exceptional players were popular, but not necessarily influential.</br>  <br>That looks like some WUG shit right there.<br>Thank you based Yamakan.</br></br>  <br> I want to back Reina on the back </br>  <br>second from left</br>  <br>Probably.<br>Shuichi as a character literally just exists to be Kumiko's love interest.<br>And Reina isn't relevant at all in volume 2 (besides her obsession with Taki), so it's not like she'd be an alternative.</br></br></br>  <br>why should it? it has nothing to do with the context of the show.</br>  <br>What an awful story.<br><br>Or more like, an awful supporting cast aside from Natsuki.</br></br></br>  So, was it dud gold?

Fuck off.<br><br>I'm frustrated that a shitty love interest ends up with a rather decent main character. I get frustrated by this very often with romance series, particularly harems.

I want to edit it into adult Kumiko</br>  <br>Ribbon chan, she's a bitch.</br>  <br>Makeup is always disgusting</br>  <br>just crop it, it's full resolution</br>  <br>Looks like a maccaron</br>  <br>Her cock.<br> Some emblem with their initals or something. </br></br>  <br>one of those stupid shits that japanese highschool girls like to strap on their phone, backpack, bag, keychain</br>  <br>Okay thanks</br>  <br>without</br>  <br>This is hot as fuck.<br> they screw up on purpose </br></br>  <br>Then they are really huge</br>  <br> Having this shit taste <br> Being a kyoanifag </br></br>  <br>AOTS of this season was Ore Monogatari<br>AOTS of next season will probably be Ore Monogatari</br></br>  <br>if they had animated that instead of what we got it would've been a lot more interesting to watch</br>  <br>Hazuki's voice is really annoying in the first song.</br>  <br>Reminds me of Seo.<br> And she's beautiful indeed. </br></br>    <br>That pout is damn cute</br>  <br>add sound</br>  <br> AOTS of this season </br>  <br>Bunch of little Taki senseis doing gestures</br>  <br>well yeah, I was specifying which season I was referring to in the phrase "anime of the season"</br>  <br>Jesus christ, Kyoani improved the character design by a lot</br>  do you still love me /a/?  <br>No.<br>But I'm glad they gave her a personality instead of just being Genki</br></br>  <br>She's always been best girl.</br>  <br>Nico what are you doing here?</br>  <br>The original designs were cute and original. KyoAni just converted them all into K-On samefaces.</br>  <br> vlc <br>but yeah, that's why I like her so much.</br></br>  <br>The original designs work well in printed media but not in animation, imbecile.</br>  disappointing finale<br>yurishit</br>  <br>Both started in the same season, so they go against each other in AOTS (unless an anime is split cour).</br>  <br>FAGOTT RETURNS</br>  <br>How would you know when you haven't seen those designs used in animation?</br>  <br>Reina looks like a fucking log with a plain face on that cover meanwhile she's breathtakingly beautiful in the show.<br>I also hate the Kyoani sameface syndrome, but damn.</br></br>  S2 when  <br>I hate that faggot, but that was so frigging cute hnnnggggg</br>  So... why did they make such a fuss about Kumiko playing or not playing that difficult passage? Sensei implied that if she was good enough, she would be allowed to play it, but they didn't make clear if she did - or was Asuka's nod the sign that they could play it together?  Just who is this fucker and why is he so much  trouble?

I'm more interested in the 7 minutes long remix of 進撃st-hrn-egt20130629巨人 that will be included.  <br>Not surprising, since it has much more manlet.</br>  <br>I don't think the first sold that much. Power of Levi?</br>  <br>Obviously. You think people watched it for the story?</br>  <br>Levi and season 2.</br>  How much did the first recap movie earn? Can't find any source.  <br>Is there a date for season 2 yet?</br>  <br>Mostly Manlet though. People going there for S2 were a big minority.</br>  http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-jsS<wbr>XHhRD9s</wbr>  [ ]<br> tfw the first part of season 2 will be a hell of a ride, and the second part will be boring as fuck. <br>Wonder how the openings will differ.</br></br>  <br>Looking forward to you faggots being cancerous as always.</br>  <br> the second part will be boring as fuck. <br>It won't.</br></br>  <br>Yes it will, except for one or two moments.</br>  <br>22 episodes for good pacing but I prefer 24 episodes to flesh out the characters and give them more backstories. 25 is a huge NO.</br>  <br>It will be 24, since they didn't have enough material for a second season after the clash of titans arc.</br>  <br> the second part will be boring as fuck. <br>I want them to condense it while adding some material to the first half but since the first has less Levi compared to the second, the opposite will happen.</br></br>  <br> characters and give them more backstories <br> More muh Marco and Araki's fanfiction </br></br>  <br>Most of the budget will be used to make manlet look even more cool. They did the same in S1.</br>  <br>There is always at least one entertaining thing in each chapter.</br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br>All the conversation will be even more boring in the anime.</br>  <br>There are a lot of new characters introduced though plus the first season didn't do a great job making the characters likeable  except Jean and Armin </br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>No. The conversations especially will be even more tedious.</br>  <br>Yes. Give me a chapter that has not a single entertaining scene.</br>  I'd love it when the staffs go with "show, don't tell" on s2 but then it's Araki we're talking about.  <br>I have to agree with him, there's Sasha stealing bread, there's Historia's lazer beam eyes, there's RT being comfy, Eren trying to get hard, rape time, Ackerman time, "Why are you retarded?" scene, Frieda's spaguetti spill, Historia's she mad and taking heroin, and the best of all  Mikasa's cuck face. <br>It'll be boring, but at least some keks will be had.</br></br>  <br>Most things you mentioned are still boring, except for a few</br>  <br>You don't have fun much, do you?</br>  <br>That's your opinion, and I don't share it.</br>  <br> second part <br>I'm mostly interested in Hysteria and if her VA is going to mess it up or not.</br></br>  I have never seen a series skyrocket in popularity then nosedive back to nobody giving a shit so quickly. Even faster than Bleach.  <br>I do, but most of it still boring.</br>  <br>*is still</br>  <br>It's because tumblr lost it's hype. It still sells the same in japan.</br>  <br> implying araki won't completely fuck up all of it by making Eren brawl with the turkey titan and deleting all moments that go in the way of his Mikasafagging <br> implying chapter 50 won't be completely redone <br> implying there won't be tons of levi shitty action fillers </br></br></br>  <br>What makes you think that?</br>  <br>Fujos in nipland still love it and they are the majority of the readers.</br>   a mysterious titan with unique appearance, intelligence and seems to have been out of touch with humanity for several decades, maybe even centuries who could maybe even be linked to the original titans <br> jk he's just some dude in steampunk goggles </br>  <br> original titans <br>That's just a theory.</br></br>  <br>I wonder if they knew about Historia when they hired Shiori Mikami to voice Krista. She never had a role similar to Historia.</br>  <br>/a/ is no indicator for popularity</br>  <br> orginal tian <br> Century <br>Shifters don't live more than 30 years. MT has at least 25 years.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe not. I assume they were already working on S1 when she showed her real personality during Utgard for the first time. Then again Isayama probably already told them about it though</br>  I heard from nips that ymir is dead, is it right?  <br>wtf is that shity theory? lol</br>  I want the new chapter already.  <br>We all do, anon.</br>  <br>Never before has it been such a pain in the ass to wait for it.</br>  <br>Sorry that Shitmir isn't going to be in it much. I'm thankful for it though.</br>  <br>I don't think so because when the anime was airing it was still barely through the Utgard arc. Ymirfags complain about their shitty dyke's Miku voice but I'd rather see Historia get a different voice. Or maybe Shiori practiced and won't be so bad.</br>  <br> Sasha stealing bread is funneh <br>Not him, but he's right.</br></br>  <br>I don't give a fuck about her, but you're obviously butthurt because your favorite was in the political arc.</br>  <br>I don't care so much about the bread stuff but I want to see the shit machine animated and crossdresser Armin. Also Mikasa's cuckface.</br>  <br>Why would I be butthurt about seeing my favorites?</br>  <br>You don't. You know it damn well that there's no chance they will animate the shit machine.<br>You're just adding stuff up.</br></br>  <br>Because I said the political arc was boring and since it included your favorite you got butthurt.</br>  <br>They better add the shit machine.</br>  <br>Because you start shitposting when they are called boring?</br>  <br>I agree the political arc is boring. But there were a few scenes I want to see. The only butthurt I see here is you though.</br>  <br>Sorry for insulting Ymir-sama. I won't do it again next time.</br>   The political arc is my second favorite arc behind Utgard-kidnapping.<br/>   <br>It was boring in general but it has some great moments so in a way that redeems it for me.</br>  <br>What great moments?</br>  <br>I liked the focus on characterization.</br>  <br>If you agree with me then why did you get so butthurt? Are you retarded?</br>  The WIT duo Imai and Ebara didn't show up in Seraph. I hopethey are currently working on Titans now  Or they're probably working on Cabanelli with Araki. <br><br>I only want from second season is less QUALITY and more sakuga.</br></br>  <br>I see, I couldn't be wrong.</br>  <br>I'm not? Calm down Ymirfag.</br>  <br>Didn't they expect Seraph to be the next big thing and it was just mediocre?</br>  <br>Again, I don't give a fuck about her and my favorite is actually also in this arc and yes you are butthurt  well you are either butthurt or just generally autistic.</br>  <br>If you didn't care about her you would have ignored me. Is that too hard for you to do?</br>  <br>Autist like you are just generally retarded. Apparently it was really hard for you to contain it, just because someone simply called this arc boring.</br>  <br>And I agreed this arc was boring.</br>  <br>At least it sold 5k, good for the studio I guess, after the failure that is the Flopping Girls.<br><br> I don't even comprehend why would they expect it to be the next big thing. The story's mediocre at best. </br></br></br>  I want to abuse the Bert.  <br>Well the manga got a good boost and V1 sales aren't bad. Not the next SnK but it's not a flop.</br>  <br>I don't see the logic behind this, my favorite was in the arc and I still find it boring.</br>  <br>Guess that's why you made that butthurt post and immediately assumed my favorite isn't in this arc.</br>  <br>Who is your favorite?</br>  <br>Some anons think if you say this arc was boring you indirectly insult their favorite.</br>  <br>I could throw up</br>  <br>I honestly like the manga, but even I can't understand why anyone expected the anime to be good. The promos were fujo pandering everywhere.</br>  <br>Isn't Historia your favorite?</br>  <br>One of my favorites.</br>  <br>I don't feel like saying because it will only start shitlifting. I'll only say it's not Erwin nor Levi.<br><br><br>y</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The arc is less boring, even pretty good, if you read it in one sitting instead of 40 pages/month over 2 years.</br></br>  <br>Why? You want to shitpost and start meta cancer?</br>  <br>Armin? I like Armin too.</br>  <br>The only character I hate is Ymir.</br>  <br>Arminfags have no reason to hide their favorites, he's the most liked here. They're also pretentious enough to act superior so I doubt it's Armin.</br>  <br>Armin is a pretty good character though.</br>  <br>No, it's  Ymir <br> inb4 shit taste. <br> Taste is mine not yours.</br></br></br>  <br>I already noticed that.</br>  <br>That's subjective and I disagree. He's mostly a generic plot device to me.</br>  <br>Figures. Disgusting, well enjoy your shit taste I guess.</br>  <br>Armin, Jean, and Historia are all well developed characters. But people like to get butthurt here and call them plot devices for it.</br>  <br>Y-You too...</br>  <br><br>Heh.</br></br>  <br>Why are you pretending to be me?</br>  <br>I like Jean and Historia though. I don't use muh development as an excuse for everything unlike you, since development isn't enough to make a good character. And again in the end it's all subjective.</br>  <br>Only the second post is mine, genius.<br>Just a little tip, but this is an anonymous image board.</br></br>  <br>Why would you reply to a question directed to someone else then, genius?</br>  <br>I'm not, just answered the favorite question too.<br><br>Of these three I think Historia is the less likely to be a plot device.</br></br></br>  <br>There's nothing wrong with development either. For example Historia would be Christa still and pretty much as flat a character one could get if more depth wasn't added to her.</br>  <br> I'm not, just answered the favorite question too. <br>It wasn't a general question, it was directed at a certain anon. I don't want to insult your intelligence for liking Ymir, but you know.<br> Of these three I think Historia is the less likely to be a plot device. <br>That should be Jean. I like Historia more than him but Jean isn't a plot device in any way. Historia, Armin and Eren are confirmed plot devices by Isayama, if that wasn't obvious already.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because maybe someone else replied to a question that was directed at someone else?</br>  <br> I'm not, just answered the favorite question too <br>That's a little bit weird, but nevermind it's okay.</br></br>  <br>Of course there's nothing wrong with it in Historia's case because that was the whole point of her character. Other characters grew more unlikeable to me after development, like Jean for example. I mean that while development isn't always a bad thing, it's not always a good thing either and it's certainly not a way to measure character quality.</br>  <br>liking an ugly, annoying dike is beyond shit.</br>   You replied to my question, how dare you? <br>Let's just stop with this shit.</br>  <br>Jean is the most realistic character, I don't see what makes him so unlikeable. Same case with Armin except he isn't very realistic in comparison but I also can't see what would make someone be annoyed by him either. I liked that his ruthlessness is balanced by his humanity. Historia is one of my top favorites but she is definitely more generic compared to Armin or Jean.</br>  <br> I don't see what makes him so unlikeable <br>Because he's annoying.</br></br>  <br>He's far less annoying than Ymir is.</br>  <br>I said he's more unlikeable TO ME than he used to be, learn to read and understand the concept of subjectivity. I know I'm on 4chan and everyone claims their opinions as facts, but it's not too hard to understand and accept that not all people like what you like. <br>In any case, Jean was realistic even before his development. If he decided to enter the MP after seeing people die it would make even more sense. Historia and Armin are generic in fiction standards, Jean isn't as generic but he might come off as boring. Actually Armin and Historia are arguably the most generic characters in SnK even if I like Historia a lot.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't make him likable.</br>  <br>They're on the same level of obnoxiousness, they are blunt and rude and they can get on your nerves easily. Isayama likes them both because of that but I wouldn't want to be around such people. Such a shit taste he has.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384520 <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br> Come on, you're just inviting people  Ymirfags  to call her a Mary Sue and a cliche Disney princess by claiming that. She was a lot less cliche when she was depressed and didn't care about anyone or anything and I felt her depression was handled rather well. Don't get me wrong, I still really like her now but I can't see how Armin or Jean are more generic than her.</br>  <br>Why does she trigger you that much? <br>Hurr durr dyke?</br></br>  <br>Probably. See </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384596 <br>Riported.</br>  <br> you're just inviting people Ymirfags to call her a Mary Sue and a cliche Disney princess <br>She is though. I like her, but she really damn is. I hate Ymirfags and their constant shitflinging and fingerpointing but that much is true.<br>  She was a lot less cliche when she was depressed <br>Not at all, do you even know what cliche and generic means? Have you even read enough manga or fiction in general? Because it looks like you haven't.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't mind if she's a lesbian. I just find her awful.</br>    <br>That's your opinion. People like characters on different ways.</br>  <br>Yes, exactly. Peoples dislike Shitmir because they're bilbethumping anti-LGBT monsters &amp; Goobergaters too probably with Conservative flags on their redneck porches.<br><br>It has nothing to do with her being the shittest character on the show, nothing at all.<br><br>Hanji is also LGBT and (s)he doesn't get quite as much hate, (s)he only gets made fun off.<br><br>Now excuse me, I have to go shoot up a black church *tips Gomorrah*</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd taste that colossal sausage.</br>  <br>I don't really mind her Mary Sue qualities because I like how Isayama portrays her.</br>  <br>Your post is kind of ironic.</br>  <br>Elaborate then.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384520 <br>Historia doesn't even act anything like a bimbo. Christa sure but Historia?</br>  <br>There I'm biting it.<br>You're the only one here who cares about that shit to whine and shitpost.<br>Some people here and you have a retarded obsession with dykes whereas others don't give a shit and when you get called out on your autism you write hemorrhoids/10 posts like you did.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384775 <br>Mikasa pls go.</br>  <br>Why is the colossal titan spaghetti?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384775 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384680 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384596 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384520 <br> RPing </br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384863 <br>And what does this all have to do with feminism you retard?</br>  <br>Nevermind. I didn't expect you to get it.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384863 <br>Great anon. I so much agree.</br>  <br> You're the only one here who cares about that shit to whine and shitpost. <br>Not really, I see Ymirfags and not only them do it all the time too. Islamfag is just extra autistic about his posts.</br></br>  <br>Stop proving the retardation of Ymirfags by replying to him.</br>  <br>A+ reply, retard. If there's something you disagree with, say what it is so I can easily prove you wrong.</br>  <br>Don't mind Islamshit, his posts never make sense. He doesn't even know the difference between ants and bees.</br>  Learn the lesson, never say you like Ymir or don't even mention her at all.  <br>You can't though, because you already proved mine.</br>  <br>But she was extremely relevant to the plot in the last year. So much stuff in the manga is happening with her character, we should really talk about her in every thread just like we always do.<br><br>It's not fair that we can't talk about our most favorite bestest written character just because of a bunch of misogynists who harass women in the video gaming industry.</br></br></br>  <br>No one is stopping you from liking Ymir or talking about her. You just care too much about what others think.</br>  <br>You don't even have to mention her. People who hate her will just do it on their own.</br>  <br>I don't.  I still "triggered" a shitposter though. </br>  <br>That's the case for any character people hate.</br>  Hey there, M'ladies. Janitor here. Don't worry about the shitposts, for I am already on the case. *tips his trilby courteously towards all the BBW in this thread*<br><br>From now on, any negative mention of your favorite characters will be deleted ok?</br></br>  <br>oh my god thank you so much for making this thread a safe-space and inclusive for all of us !!!</br>  <br>Curses, foiled again. *shakes their fist angrily in the air*<br><br>Looks like us LGBTphobic misogynists just cannot win??</br></br></br>  <br>No you didn't, in case you haven't noticed I casually started shitposting in this thread and then I just adjusted my shitposting towards Ymir since you were talking about him again. Shitposting about Ymir simply gets the most replies so why wouldn't I.</br>  <br>WHAT ABOUT THIS THEORY? Shifters do not live more than 30 years ? LOL</br>  Eren is best boy  <br>Historia please go</br>    <br>I like Ymir. She's lesbian done right.</br>  <br>How do you write one wrong?</br>  <br> strong independent womyn that doesn't need no man <br> done right <br>You mean done as every other lesbian.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really though. She's literally nothing but a setereotype.<br><br> tuff action girl who don't need no man (except when she do - BR) <br> doesn't get any of the girls <br> and of course, has to be a PoC <br><br>When was the last time you seen a femme non-black non-trans character who indefiniteness as lesbin?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Historia</br>  <br>uhm....historia is a grey asexual lithromantic</br>  <br>Show me one page where Historia shows ROMANTIC feelings to any other girl. Hetfags can use a bunch of blushing panels for Reiner and Eren, but what can you do? The page where she told Ymir to live for themselves wasn't romantic in the slightest.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>man we really need to take down the het-triarchy</br>  <br>She had her panties off for Mikasa.</br>  <br>oh my god...this is so deep!<br><br> mikasa kills historia thinking she wants to steal eren <br> as historia dying in a poodle of blood, she whispers her last words <br> mikasa leans in closer to hear <br> "b-but i only loved you mikasa..." (dies) <br><br>how Mikasa react would?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So you're admitting it that you hate her because she's a lesbo? This manga isn't even about romance and that's the only thing going for you?</br>  <br>Historia was just trying to make Mikasa jealous because she likes her.</br>  <br>She blushed twice for Ymir and once for Sasha.</br>  <br>Oh my god, finally I see the err of my ways. Thank you for once again telling me that the only reason I dislike Ymir is because of her sexuality, it must be true.</br>  <br>Classic defensive Ymirfag, I didn't say I hate her. I just don't like and overhype her her as much as you guys do.</br>  <br>This. She fell in love with her after they bonded in the woods.</br>  <br>Yes, she blushed when she licked her in public and when she forced alcohol down her throat in public. That's 100% romantic blushes. And the nose shadow when she was looking up also counts as a blush so that's three times actually!</br>  <br><br><br>Her sexuality isn't fanservicey, or drawn attention to, it just is. <br>And her personality is just one of a normal person. She has good attributes, and bad attributes. She's not raised onto a pedastal as an ideal. She isn't a "strong independent womyn that doesn't need no man", she's just a person.</br></br></br></br>  <br> overhype <br>She's not even my favorite and I only see shitposting involving her.</br></br>  <br>I was just going to say that, but you can't reason with them because they think suffocating blushes are romantic. That's like Eren's blush when Annie was almost killing him in training, and Isayama said Eren doesn't like Annie.</br>  <br> That's 100% romantic blushes. <br>Well according to /snk/ no character blushes out of embarrassment.</br></br>  <br>I didn't "write one wrong" you moron, I intended to write "done" as I did.</br>  <br>Then you're not looking at all. It's either shitposting or overhyping and stupid theories about her being the mastermind.</br>  <br> Isayama said Eren doesn't like Annie. <br>Wew lad, really? Why do EAfags still exist then?</br></br>  <br>Why do YHfags exist? Why do BRfags exist? Why do shipperfags exist in a manga with no shipping?</br>  <br>That's because they're hiding in /u/ or the other place now.</br>  <br> and stupid theories about her being the mastermind. <br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;111947860 </br></br></br>  <br>More like they fucked in the woods.</br>  <br>Because tumblr.</br>  <br>You know 90% is shitposting and don't try to deny it.<br><br> and stupid theories about her being the mastermind <br>Discussing goes that far. I've seen worse theories. Still better that whining.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Also<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;93699271 <br><br>Holy shit man, I used to be a fucking legend.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> theories about her being the mastermind <br>Where? Last one I remember was that Mikasa was the final boss.</br></br>  <br>There's a difference of serious theories and discussing from ironic "theories".</br>  <br>*fookin legend</br>  <br>Can you please quote that post. I'm interested.</br>  <br>They seem really serious about it. And I'm not talking about greentext fanfics like , but actual theories that she's an Ackerman, her speed or getting half out of the titan is a special ability, that she knows everything about anyone and she moves the strings and that she is MT's daughter even if MT is younger than her. Also a titan deity. Fuck this, I could go on.</br>  <br>Were people serious about the radioactive cave?</br>  <br>Some guy actually made a compilation of all the vorpal claw posts.<br><br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/115318<wbr>235/#115318343<br>Other than the "power ranking" post, literally every single one of them is not mine (so probably actually serious).<br><br>I didn't even know about some of those.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>You did that? Holy shit the autism.</br>  <br>The compilation? No, I was on holidays in October. The power ranking? Yes. It's clearly ironic and making fun of autists like you goys in this thread, in case you haven't noticed.</br>  <br>The compilation is old and needs updating, I've seen some really retarded recent theories and the leaf tumblr fanwanking needs to be in there too.</br>  <br> theories that she's an Ackerman, <br>Eh?<br><br>Not that it's radioactive, but the people could have some collateral effect with over exposition to the crystal, since the whole thing it's too good to be harmless.<br>But it's up to you believe it or not.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That and the nation named after Ymir.</br>  <br>The Reiss have been using those caves for years and I don't think they all became ill because of it.</br>  <br> theories that she's an Ackerman <br>Nips assume it and then people also started to talk about it here.</br></br>  <br>I know where you could find a nation *of* Ymirs, if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>They didn't, they only got down there when they really needed.</br>  <br>It just need to be changed to "Ymir is 100% a dyke" and it's perfect.</br>  <br>In the toilet!</br>  <br>Maybe Urie getting sick is connected or is it just because of the coordinate?</br>  <br>Or that she owned titan slaves. The retarded theories never end, I'm telling you.</br>  <br>Too bad Historia is an Erenshitter now too.</br>  <br> in b4 all of them come true </br>  <br><br>The sewers make more sense.</br></br>  <br>*Servant<br>Because one day he was a human, anon.</br></br>  I dislike Ymir but I don't see what's wrong with theorizing about her.  <br>Same here. I also dislike Ymir, but I think she's the best character.</br>  So by the end of this arc, the SL should arrive at Shinganshina and fight MT+BR. But if they do... what else is left to cover? I mean yeah, visiting Titan Village, but generally it always seemed like MT was the final boss. Unless he isn't and there is someone even higher-ranking than him.  <br>Why? Do you think she's best in the sense that she's the most original, or the most useful to the plot?</br>  <br>Wall Titans</br>  <br><br>Although I would agree that the test subject was retarded.</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Sure you do.</br>  <br>I think we'll only see the titan village in flashbacks, the SL won't get there. What if this arc focuses on MT and BR and the final arc is about saving Annie and the wall titans waking up?</br>  Give an actual reason why you don't think Ymir is a good character.<br>Hard mode- no "she's a shit"</br>  <br>Why do people need to provide essays why they don't like a character here? I don't like her because she doesn't appeal to me.</br>  <br>There's no need for that if you're not an ELfag, but it's a fact that there's a lot of shitposting about Bert and Ymir here. Bert's mostly from an anon who hates him.</br>  <br>So do you just ignore the shitposting about others too or do you only care when it's someone from BRY.</br>  <br>I'm not going to spend much time on this because her fags annoy me and they're going to fight me for this, but I don't like her because she's annoying and rude. Sure her intentions are good but she's still rude and annoying and her smug face makes me want to punch her. Being a lesbian is always portrayed like a good thing even if it's neutral and she's too much of a special snowflake for just a random person from outside the walls.<br>I'm not claiming my taste is superior since my favorites get a lot of shit here, but learn to accept that not everyone has to like your favorite, it's annoying and makes you look like a whiny child.</br></br>  <br>It depends on which shingekis you like more, I don't like shitposting about manlet or Historia either. Others I still report though.</br>  <br>Because she's a one dimensional character who has no depth and is only used as a plot device. She literally had no value in the story outside of being a red herring (Ymir-sama) or the Magic Negro archetype who exists to unlock the white female protagonist's character (Historia's).</br>  <br>That's okay.<br>Shitposting, whining and throwing shit at other characterfags is not.</br></br>  <br>I see Ymirfags do that a lot, and don't give me shit about how I know because I do know. At least I can come up with some legitimate reasons for disliking a character and don't go full retard doing what you said.</br>  <br> An Ymirfag here  I'm not mad, it's your opinion, although some of those could be debatable, it's still an opinion. I agree she's rude sometimes, but that's part of being too honest.</br>  <br>Yeah Jesus we know that you know everything.<br>How do you explain posts like this? </br></br>  <br>Not that anon, but "good or bad" are just opinions.<br>But we can talk about the fact that she was only created to provide information and some depth to Historia. <br>So we have this girl with no story and a hard tongue, which only attractive trait for readers is being a lesbian and some vague attribute like: being a princess, being a goddess, being a princess goddess, being from a very special group. You know, the problem is her fan's obsession about trying so hard to turning Ymir into a snowflake while she is fun because she is an annoying brat with too many secrets that could fix many problems, but she chose to shut up because she is just a teenager.</br></br></br>  <br>You can still be honest without hurting someone's feelings.<br><br><br> How do you explain posts like this? <br>Autism. I don't like her either but I don't agree with these posts.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then why do you keep bitching when it happens to just Bert or Ymir. Drawing attention to it also makes the autists shitpost more because they see it bugs you.</br>  <br> attractive trait for readers is being a lesbian <br>How is that an attractive trait?<br> inb4 LGBT community </br></br></br>  <br>I think so too. I like Bert and I see everyone is chill about him as long as some retard doesn't play victim about the hate. Same for Ymir, the hate starts when someone complains about the hate, even if there's no hate in the thread.</br>  <br>It means that it appeals to some people.<br>Mikasa being the only Asian appeals to some, Eren being a ragetard appeals to fujos etc.</br></br>  <br>I like Bert too but I don't care about Bort/Blorty whatever else they call him.</br>  <br>Even when they aren't mentioned at all people will still make dozens of shitposts.</br>  <br>Well then.  I still don't know how this could be attractive in the slightest.  unless you fap to these kind of stuff. </br>  <br>Which again, happens to others. But you guys make it worse when you whine about it instead of ignoring it.</br>  <br>Ignore and report them, it happens to other characters too. The only thing that annoys me with these posts is that mods only ban islamfag, when there's someone who shitposts in a similar way about Bert and other characters, with names and reverse shitposts like how he makes his fan girl heart flutter and all. Maybe people just don't report these after all.</br>  <br>I actually dislike him and I don't really get how these names are supposed to be insulting. They just sound weird.</br>  <br>Just retards who think it's funny or something I guess.</br>  <br>They're not insulting but the people who use them do it to degrade him so it it counts as an insult. It's all a matter of context.</br>  <br> Autism. <br>So explaining exactly why a character is written like shit is 'autism'? I guess you're correct since autism seems to be the go to response by actual autists when they're confronted with opinions they can't refute.<br><br>In a way, you're not actually talking about the opinion - when you said 'Autism' you are talking about yourself - it is basically short for "I don't know how to refute this post so it's triggering my Autism.".<br><br><br>Is literally the most logical, rational and ad-hominem free explanation why her/xur/his character is garbage tier writing.<br><br>S/x/he, Annie and Bert are literally one of the worst written characters in the entire anime/manga universe. You shit on Levi a lot but even he is better than these three pathetic exemplars of desperate writing excuses.<br><br>It just seriously boggles the mind how you can keep deluding yourself and blocking stuff like this out.<br><br>The three turds I mentioned are the worst written characters of the series - whether you like it or not.<br><br>Jean is the best written character of the series -whether you like it or not.<br><br>Why is it so hard to understand? I am your superior, both on an intellectual level and a maturity level (since I'm probably the only well adjusted social good looking person who happens to post in this thread [for shit and giggles]). My opinion is objectively better than yours. You can call it "shitposting" all you want - you clearly need it to be able to sleep at nights - but it doesn't change the fact that I'm right and you're wrong &amp; that my opinion &gt;&gt;&gt; yours.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>literally the only poster worth reading itt</br>  http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>06638</wbr>  <br>Man, you sure have a lot of free time to waste on explaining your shit taste. I feel a little bad for you.</br>  <br>I just downloaded it, it's a virus.</br>  <br> Man, you sure have a lot of free time to waste on explaining your shit taste. <br>It's called "being at work". I know that you NEET losers living in your mothers' basements don't know what that feels like but us adults have to go to work to earn money.</br></br>  <br> for shit and giggles <br>More like because you got nothing better to do with your life. Kind of sad.</br></br>  <br> It's called "being at work".  <br>Shitposting is not a job.</br></br>  <br>Sure thing, NEET.</br>  <br>Being at work makes your brain cells commit suicide? Sure.</br>  <br><br>Obvious Ymirfag-samefag.<br><br> it is sad that you have a job and aren't a happy NEET permavirgin neckbeard who's stuck in his mom's basement jerking off to the thought of becoming a lesbian African woman all day long <br><br><br>I work as an office clerk at the Beirut town hall (since I am an intellectual with a 4 year college degree). I can easily multitask to shitposting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so cool, I wish I was as cool as you and not a pathetic neet who jerks off to being Ymir</br>   Get interested in SnK again <br> Come back to threads after 1.5 years <br> See this <br><br>What the fuck happened to these SnK threads? When the fuck did all these shipper fags appear?</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Come back to threads after 1.5 years <br>Nice try, but the threads were filled with even more SJWs and Ymirfaks 1.5 year ago.</br></br>  <br>Sure NEET. It's the internet, you can pretend to be anything here, it's okay.</br>  <br>I wouldn't have to pretend anything, but last time I posted my penis on /soc/ I got banned for it. Mod has clearly saved all my pics to know what I look like.</br>  <br>They were not this prevalent. I remember it was mainly Anniefags and Bertfags that were shitting up the threads, but they weren't this vocal.</br>  <br>Nice blog. Now fuck off.</br>  I like Adonis Ape but I'll miss Mystery Monkey  Can't we go back to those times when we laughed at Manlet's shit jokes and it was an amazing discovery that Bert and Reiner were Colossal and Armored?  <br>what is dead may never return</br>  <br>BR reveal wasn't amazing. It was unintentionally hilarious.</br>  <br> unintentionally  <br>Not really, there was no buildup just because it was intentional.</br></br>  what do you think of Ymir's disappearance?  <br>I think it is very important, let's talk about it for 30 minutes at least.</br>  <br>So many things happened this chapter and that's still the only thing you wanna talk about? Fuck off already.</br>  <br>Oh yeah sorry let's talk instead about how Historia blushed for Eren and they held hands together. Bet you'd like that you hetfag scum.</br>  <br>Will it be changed in the anime like Annie's laugh?</br>  <br>I hope she's dead.</br>  <br>Both. I think it was perfect.</br>  <br>Or we could talk about motherfucking MT or what Keith knows. Or we could not force irrelevant discussion for a change.</br>  TheWeightOfLives<br>http://vocaroo.com/i/s0QJar8Dw0Nb</br>  Guys I think Ymir is MT.  <br>No, MT is obviously Jean.</br>  <br>Keith was there at the titan encounter in the forest at the very beginning of the manga. Maybe it really was a shifter.</br>  <br>Possibly, Araki likes to make everything more dramatic. I bet he'll prettify all the crying too like he did with Annie in the final episode.</br>  <br>I just wanted to provide some topic to talk about, but no some fag had to come and shitpost it like a fucking baby, get the fuck out of here douche</br>    <br>Actually the extreme laugh was Isayama's idea. Araki just overdid it a little.</br>  <br>I don't think it was a shifter, but he knew Grisha so he might provide Eren with some new memories.</br>  <br>Maybe he'll also overdo Gesumin.</br>  <br>I liked how Isayama described it, but it wasn't how Araki depicted it, in the anime she looked like an edgy slut when that happened, while Isayama's intention was to make her like a conflicted teenager that is now free of secrets.</br>  <br>Probably. He thinks he'll be an evil dictator anyway.</br>  <br>Please no more forced Ymir discussions, everyone's tired of your shit. If you want to provide a topic, there are tons of barely discussed topics. Again, fuck off.</br>  <br>Isayama said he liked it. Well he was probably lying.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127392768 <br> wanting to eat Ymir's children <br>Disgusting.</br></br>  <br>So was she gone because she saw MT approach and hid before he could spot her? Or did she strike some sort of deal with him and wasn't shown for suspense?</br>  <br>You are an idiot then, if you can't even talk about Ymir, gonna report you fagg.</br>  <br>Probably imprisoned. Some nips assume she escaped.</br>  <br>You are so right. Not only should we ban people who dislike Ymir, we should also ban people who want to talk about something other than Ymir.</br>  <br>I guess, but I always assumed she'd be imprisoned once they reached the village. I mean, who is guarding her right now? As far as we know, MT can only create mindless titans, and he seemed the only person around together with BR.</br>  <br>Great song</br>  <br> I wonder when Annie with get hooked up to the shit machine.</br>  <br>Soon.</br>  Wait so the second compilation didn't announce anything for season 2? There was only the Hanji and Nick teaser? No other tease at all?  <br>yes, no other tease. Plus they animated the annie vs mikasa chapter 44 scene in the beginning of the movie.</br>  <br>Damn, would've thought they'd give us the season at least.</br>  <br>We can get news during the release of the live action movie, maybe august or September.</br>    <br>Those two look oddly good together.</br>  <br>Why does Bert have to suffer in every single pairing? Even the ones that involve him.</br>  <br> implying Bert doesn't enjoy it </br>  <br>Because he's shit.</br>  <br>Maybe if making Bert a beta in the spin off was one of Isayama's ideas.</br>  <br>Isayama and Chuugakkou-chan are friends, according to an interview Isayama gives the basic ideas for the stories and then Chuugakkou-chan improvises. Most of it is his idea.</br>  <br>I knew he's giving her ideas, but it looks like he is more involved than I thought.</br>  <br>He gives ideas and supervises the final result, how more involved can he get? The next step is writing it by himself.</br>  <br>Maybe, but it doesn't really matter. Chuugakkou Bert is still a cute even if he's not Isayama's idea.</br>  <br>I thought he's just giving her a few ideas for some jokes. Didn't except him to actually supervise it. So making Frieda a pervert was actually his idea.</br>  <br>I hope he gets more screentime in the manga soon, all the extra official content he gets is wonderful but he was written off the story for too long.</br>  <br>Maybe. Of course he supervises it, that's required for all official content. Not necessarily giving all ideas, but he has to read it and accept the content before it's publicized.</br>  I love how everybody here used to hate Chuigakkou before it got an official translation.  <br>Only Bortfags like it.</br>  <br>I assume the same applies to spoof, since it was also an official spin off.<br><br><br>Some parts are actually kind of funny now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's about the same. Only the Chuugakkou Bert and Erwin chapters are good.</br>  <br>I didn't hate it in the first place, but I admit the translation makes it a lot funnier.</br>  <br>The same applies to everything that is labeled as official, which also means Spoof, smartpass content, ACWNR, the VNs and so on.</br>  <br>Does CR also translate them or do you always have to wait for the full volume?</br>  <br>That's Milo</br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br>Chuugakkou Bert is a miracle and I'm not even a Bertfag.</br>  <br>Hounori said he only met Isayama once.</br>  <br>He's annoying.</br>  <br>You need to wait I think.</br>  <br>I for one find him endearing.</br>  <br>Because he's beta.</br>  <br>That's because you have shit taste.</br>  <br>Yannopoulos?</br>  <br>At least for volumes 2 and 3 it seems to be the case. Not that the other chapters are bad, but they're a little meh. They all have their moments though.<br><br>His misery is hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br> you need to pay even if you want to die <br>what a shitty world</br></br>  <br>That's too bad. I'm interest in one of the recent chapters and I've heard the translation is kind of slow.</br>  <br>Yeah the latest chapters seem fun, especially the Frieda and Valentine's one.</br>  <br>Next volume comes out November 10th.</br>  <br>I read the Frieda one but which is the valentines one?</br>  <br>Not on my country. And I still think it's shipperfaggotry bait.</br>  <br>It should be at the other place I think. Reiner, Bert and Jean didn't get chocolates for Valentines and tried to take revenge. There's a lot of NTR as usual.</br>  <br>The previous chapter before the one with Frieda.</br>  <br>Oh that one, yeah I read that. Thanks.</br>  <br>I want to ruffle his hair. <br><br><br>http://imgur.com/a/NUbg5<br><br>It's this one.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's husbando material.</br>  I have two questions, how did ape Titan know about annie being captured? Reiner was extremely exhausted,so why people claim he git easly ass kicked?  Where are you guys getting the translations of Attack on OogaChakacowtipping or whatever it's called?  <br> do enjoy </br>  <br>BR told him. And Reiner is still the AT.</br>  <br>that was a mistranslation, correct me if I'm wrong, but Annie was never mentioned when Bort and Roider were shown with troubles</br>  <br>Thanks for sharing by the way.<br><br> how did ape Titan know about annie being captured? <br>BR probably explained the situation and asked for his help.<br> Reiner was extremely exhausted <br>How so? It's been two months since we last saw them, how can you assume that he wasn't prepared for the fight?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just got it off from Crunchyroll and heard others saying other sites had a mistranslation with Annie, I'll have to reread it i apologize if I'm stupid and wrong</br>  <br> correct me if I'm wrong <br>You are wrong. MT said Annie-chan, unless he meant Ani-chan and BR are now brothers.</br></br>  <br>No it wasn't. I read the raws and Annie was mentioned. CR screwed up and put him instead or something, but quickly corrected their mistake.</br>  <br><br>Ok I apologize. I'm actually glad they mentioned Annie, lol</br></br>  <br><br> apologizing <br><br>Congratulations, you are the 1% on this website. Feel proud, buddy. Feel proud. You have exhibited basic human decency.<br><br>May your soul never be crushed. &lt;/3</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>are we taxed on 4chan ?<br><br>if i get 4chan gold will i not get taxed</br></br></br>  <br><br>No, 4chan is an anarchy. No taxes.</br></br>  <br> lol <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>will do chief</br>  <br> Kill yourself. <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>Calm down.</br>  <br> &gt;Kill yourself. <br> Kill yourself. <br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br>    I bet Keith is going to rejoin the SL and get killed horribly.  <br><br>hoe dont do it</br></br>  <br>but not before he explains the plot  lol </br>  <br>The problem is, that reiner was all ten time in armored titan form. Last time we have seen them was like 2 years a bo when they failed to deliver captured eren. Or it could be that he took A nap with bert nad had duel with mt and that was why he lost</br>  <br> &gt;&gt;Kill yourself. <br> &gt;Kill yourself. <br> Kill yourself. <br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm guessing he's either too old or injured if he retired</br>  <br>Fuck off Tumblr shit.</br>  <br>I'm assuming the one responsible for creating the Titans, and possibly the Titan Shifter Trio's superior.</br>  <br>Or scared.</br>  <br> using Tumblr as an insult <br><br>let's get back to discussing SnK mate</br></br></br>  <br> hoe dont do it <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>I don't know what you're talking about but I suggest reading the manga.</br>  <br><br>I did that to instigate you.<br><br>You fell for it.<br><br>GG M8 10/10 IGN</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tumblr is an insult you massive retard.</br>  <br>looks like you out meemed him bro</br>   this thread   <br>I think he became an instructor because he had a mental breakdown for leading so many of his men to their deaths. If he knows Grisha's intentions I think he might go on the basement mission.</br>  <br/>  <br><br>Thanks, Cheney.</br></br>  <br>I meant anon that bert and reiner werent shown since two years and they got owned easly by mt, cuz reinerr was exhausted fighting titans in chapter ~50</br>  <br>haha putin so how goes invade ukraine</br>  <br>Go back to Tumblr, Ymirshit.</br>  <br> since two years <br>Months anon, MONTHS. Manga time. You stop being exhausted after a day, imagine if two months pass since your last fight. And stop writing like that.</br></br>  So do we actually think MT is the physically strongest titan or is he just really adept at fighting?<br><br>anyone else getting hungry looking at those food captchas?</br></br>  <br><br>I, Putin, am the Ymirshit. Not that Dick fellow.<br><br>...Actually that's a lie, I'm an Arminfag.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He ripped Reiner's armor face, he's stronk</br>  <br>Just as bad. And stop coming here you retard.</br>  <br>so he's got that insane monkey strength I guess</br>  Another garbage thread full of fingerpointing, meta, and no actual discussion. Get it together you bunch of whiny cunts.  <br>Thanks for corections mate, but how do we know for sure that he did not rest until this time?</br>  <br>Just to be sure: Armored skin is the same as Female Titan's hardening ability. But Annie's crystal is not the same as armored skin.<br>Still, how did MT defeated Armored? How strong can be a giant monkey?</br></br>  <br>Both were probably ready to fight, since it looked like it was a scheduled battle to settle an issue, in our case saving Annie before getting the coordinate.</br>  <br>Annie's crystal is the same material as Reiner's armor. Monkey too stronk.</br>  <br> Monkey too stronk. <br>Well, they defeated Turkey Mayhem so easily...</br></br>  <br>He was mindless and a giant walking target.</br>  <br><br>The thing I wonder is if MT is incredibly agile, let's say if he had the speed combined with his strength, could he prop his feet on AT to get leverage while ripping off his face armor?</br></br>  <br>Thanks once again, I owe you one</br>  <br>Faster than Armored but also the same height, isn't it? That's kinda scary.</br>  <br>A-Anon, you're too kind for this place, it's just wrong.</br>  <br>I really wish I could have seen /a/'s reaction. Does anyone have a copy of the thread?</br>  <br>Speed doesn't really matter in such fights, it's not a decent skill. If you notice, AT has punch marks on his shoulders which means that MT is just strong enough to break his armor.<br> Sorry about all the watermarks, I don't have the CR with me. </br></br>  <br>The reaction carried on for years, the /a/ 4cc team even has a player based on this page.</br>  <br>MT is pretty creepy, I want to see him fighting and crushing soldiers like a mad gorilla.   And I am afraid how Araki is going to fuck his design in S3: laser beams? Golden hair?  </br>  Man this thread went from horrible to downright Hitler in less than two hours.  <br>ahh i see thanks<br><br><br>I agree he is giving me some  troubles  with his creepy face.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd say it's better than people bitching about which shippers are top-tier fags.</br>  <br>The usual.</br>  <br><br>+1<br><br>I hate using Tumblr memes but that anon really is a precious cinnamon roll.<br><br>Now excuse me as I go down a gallon of bleach for saying that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oh Berty. My Berty. You make my fan girls farts splutter. Can't you see that a fat Rhino is in love with you? No matter what Pigner and Shitmirfags say you are the most interesting and complex character in this manga. You are not wallpaper, but in fact the mascot of the series. You are not ugly and balding, you have a complex beauty that only intellectuals can appreciate. Bimbongfags and Wongfags may shit all over you but it's because they are jealous. Levifags hate you because you rival him in merchandise and relevance. Just ignore the haters and baiters that live to tear you down.  <br> Bimbong <br><br>who?</br></br></br>  <br>I can even smell your butthurt while writing that, why would anyone be so obsessed with hating Bert, we'll never find out.</br>  <br>Someone irrelevant.</br>  <br>I'm wondering this in general.</br>  <br><br>This guy is the islamfag equivalent for Bert, I bet that's all he thinks about all day and angrily types all that down thinking "NOW I'LL SHOW THEM"</br></br>  <br>Reiner is Bimbong.</br>  <br>thunks</br>  <br>He's already Pigner.</br>  <br>And he's also a bimbo so he's Bimbong too.</br>  <br><br> Defends Bert <br> Hating Bert <br>Pick one.You should know that i'm not to only one who calls him Berty. There seems to be other like minded individuals around here.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I just call him Roider</br></br></br>  <br> blonde <br> retarded <br> a princess <br>It all makes sense.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're just realizing it?</br>  <br> Maybe if I try harder I'll convince someone! <br> That will sure show those Bortfags! <br>Get a life man, it might have a toll on your mental health.</br></br></br>  <br> Bort <br>I hate that name. That's it, the conversation ends here until all of these unfunny names you people give to Bert stop.</br></br>  <br>Bortykins.</br>  <br>I love calling Bort Bort. I don't hate him as a character, but I just like calling him it.</br>  <br>What I said about your mental health, look it up.
