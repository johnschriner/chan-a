[ Did hinata deserve to win? <br><br>Rereading the series she became a little too obsessive about naruto. To the point where it was unhealthy as fuck. I feel she never grew up in that sense as winning negated the probability of her finding the strength to move on.</br></br>  I'm still fucking pissed we didn't get followup on Orochimaru or Kabuto. You spent all that time giving them a comeback and then don't even tell us what the two most notorious ninja from the leaf village outside of the Uchiha clan do after the world is saved and the hokage herself knows a man who tried to destroy her village is alive. Not to mention where was the followup about Kabuto escaping that mind rape loop ?  Diver &gt; Sign &gt; Kaze &gt; Silhouette &gt; Closer &gt; Hero's Come Back &gt; Toumei Datta sekai &gt; Niwaka Ame ni mo Makezu &gt; Newsong &gt; Moshimo &gt; Distance &gt; Blue Bird &gt; Guren &gt; Hotaru no Hikari &gt; Totsugeki Rock &gt; Lovers &gt; Tsuki no ÅŒkisa<br><br>fite me</br></br>  <br>I don't have any, nor do I have the desire to bother looking for any. Imagine the standard Chad Thundercock, and then resize his popped collars, snapbacks and Converse shoes down to toddler sizes.</br>  <br>Fashion? Both Sarada and Chouchou have them too.</br>  <br> Did hinata deserve to win? <br>Who the hell else was going to? Nobody else wanted Naruto. That was the entire point of their romance: they were two profoundly lonely people who found support and unconditional love in each other that they couldn't find anywhere else in the world.</br></br>  Find me a better fight in anime.<br><br> you can't </br></br>  <br> dubbed <br><br>Holy shit I'm crying. I can't believe I used to watch anything dubbed.</br></br></br>  <br>26 secs of fluid action between 1 hour of zzzzzzzzzzzzzz<br>typical shaft anime</br></br>  <br>The problem is the lack of thematic foreshadowing. In the previous arc, nen and technology coexist. In fact, it's implied that only through use of nen can the most powerful technology be created. (The video game and all the artifacts within it.)<br><br>I think Meruem losing to the bomb was a cool idea, but the execution was lousy. The reader has no idea that the HxH universe even has nuclear technology until that moment. It's a deus ex machina.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Finally somebody who understands that the Naruto vs. Pain fight was 9/10 animation. Yes, the artstyle is debatable but the animation was excellent.</br></br>  <br><br>Many Naruto battles have excellent animation. Kakashi vs Obito, Naruto vs Sasuke, Naruto vs Pain, Sasuke vs Orochimaru to name a few.</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RTS<wbr>haDDj6Mg</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Mayuri is cute</br></br>      <br>I'm not even calling her "disgusting lesbo" seriously calm down and think about it. People hate Miku not because she is a lesbian but because her interaction with the girls are awful, she doesn't even spend time with Shidou and the little time they have in side stories or the novels Miku behaves like a lesbian. Seriously, even the twins have it better in the background where the author can't touch them.</br>  <br>Yoshino had more appearances in that trailer than anyone else. Why are they pushing her so hard?</br>  <br>Shidou is a lolicon.</br>  Read the guide before asking questions <br>buyfag.moe</br>  <br>anyone have the illustration that inspired this color?</br>  <br>If Kyoani just gave us a kissu, I'd buy it.</br>  <br>google</br>  <br>There is absolutely nothing plump about that figure.</br>  http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>92240<br>I need this. Now.</br></wbr>    <br>Hanayo has more screen time than Kotori in 2nd season, and even more along with other 1st year ones in the movie.</br>  <br>boring as fuck only thanks to the anime... the anime gave rice no screen time and its dreadfully sad. <br><br>  also to make her glasses in one episode only to take them away.... how fuckin could they </br></br></br>  <br>does...it really matter? all i care about is khu</br>  <br>fuck i posted too soon. is this true for the movie? if so, when or how can i see it<br><br> inb4 google it </br></br></br>  Kotori a shit.  sound euphonium was easily 10/10  <br>It's because the best girl is on the cover.</br>  <br>Personally, Resound giving the impression of an echo is fitting. Like hearing the instruments resound in the big auditorium for the competition feels pretty badass.</br>  <br> winter <br> AOTS <br> implying it wasn't boring as fuck </br></br></br>  <br>I also think it sounds more like a command that way.<br><br>Resound! Euphonium. Like you're telling your eupho to resound.</br></br></br>   shitphonium <br> anything other than polished turd <br><br>Well meme'd my friend.</br></br></br>  Have you sworn you complete and undying allegiance to Ainz-sama today?<br><br>And before anyone ask:<br><br>Do we really need another thread? Well yes, Ainz demands it you inferior meatbag.<br>Yes the framerate for the first episode sucks, blame funi, use [ayy]<br>Do you want to read the novel? https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA<br><br>Also Vol 9 spoilers for the first chapter:<br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Because he is so practical against pretty much any kind of enemies. Also he has that elegant nazi aura.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>So he doesn't have to be the best, just stronger than you?</br></br></br></br>  <br>He just has to be able to counter you.<br>The fact that he can rapidly change his skillset lets him do this.</br></br>  So are we still streaming on douyu?   Cool, this seems to have a lovely cas- <br> FUCKING SHOTA TRAP FETISHIZED SHIT <br>Dropped, you have no idea how fast.</br></br>  Are you faglords ready for the next episode with tons of Papi's ass, Smith Legs and HORSE PUSSY? <br><br><br>also  there is any page for the live watch? </br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Feudal society narrows the potential inspiration cultures.<br><br>Her culture being heavily influenced by The Little Mermaid means they're somewhere in Europe.<br><br>Her helpers in Chapter 34 are wearing clothes fit for the 19th century, around the same time Hans Christian Anderson was alive.<br><br>One of her helpers is named Sebastian, the other is Potemkin. Sebastian is Germanic/Scandinavian, while Potemkin is Russian.<br><br>We can safely assume Mero is from either the Baltic or North Sea, which means there's a likelihood she would identify as either Dutch, English or Danish.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>this is honestly out of control <br><br> monster-people nazis chapter <br><br>there's so many weird as fuck non-sequiturs, I honestly think there's something wrong with the mangaka who wrote it.<br><br> that chapter where the noble Japanese centaur samurai murder all the evil Spanish gaijin slave traders and stop Spain from attacking Japan. <br><br>Holy shit, the weird Japanese nationalist sentiment is so strong.<br><br> all the weird vagina, lesbian, and piss fetishism too </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> But in my personal made-up version of events that I will sell the rights to Okayado to use for an exorbitant fee, Monmusus come from parallel pocket-universes that are alternate versions of various locations on Earth (a desert with Lamias, under water enviornments with Mermaids, forests full of Centaurs, etc., all environments from Earth contained in closed-off pocket-dimensions) that only had intermittent points of travel-ability between the two planes throughout the ages (thusly resulting in ancient people rarely being exposed mythical creatures, but enough to create vast legends and myths about them). <br><br>Does anyone else like this idea? This makes sense.<br>The intermittent bridging between the dimensions, probably accomplished through magic or some other such conveyance, is likely how all-female species like Lamias and Harpies acquired their men.<br><br> tfw you will never be a 16th century explorer that suddenly disappears one day never to be heard from again and assumed dead, when in reality you were abducted through a dimensional rift into a Lamia-village, where you spend the rest of your days as a pampered communal concubine in an opulent desert palace </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Several of the Monmusu home-worlds and societies we've seen so far have been HEAVILY influenced by various sides of human culture <br><br>yes, because they live on land, near humans, you stupid ponce.</br></br></br>    It's like I'm watching Nanoha A's all over again.<br>I hope we get cartridge-fueled fisting.</br>  <br>Ah shit, you're right. I can't google well. A bit more searching reveals a (more believable) number of 5'7" and change for women, which makes Maria substantially less below average than thought.</br>  <br><br>I really wish they wouldn't bait my yurifag tendencies with this shit.</br></br>  <br> Ver <br>Every time. Every goddamn time.</br></br>  <br> 2 new characters were introduced <br> HURR IT'S LIKE A'S ALL OVER AGAIN <br><br>Don't compare this to shit like A's.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Average female height is probably closer to 5'5 if not shorter. All those Chinese and Indian ladies are tiny. <br><br>5'7 is above average for a female.</br></br></br>  Chinasue did nothing wrong  YURUYURIYURUYURIYURUYURIYURUYURIYUR<wbr>UYURIYURUYURI<br><br> WAI! </br></br></wbr>  <br>Cutest wanko.</br>  <br>actually took me a while to find, but i am a dummie, so bear with me</br>  hi can i please have chinatsu pictures wear shes cute like this one???  <br> thong <br>Sasuga.</br></br>  Are you a true enthusiast with godlike taste?  <br>you're a weird guy</br>  <br>anon<br>that's almost as bad as  hand holding </br></br>  <br>Hitler was a little unexpected but I can understand you finding him moe.</br>  <br>everyone's talking about their fucked up fetishes but i'm the weird one?<br><br>wait, yeah that makes sense</br></br></br>  <br>Fapping to vanilla is weird</br>  Drawfag Thread 1538<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1529:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn <br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1537 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you Tamabro, can't wait to see them finished, have fun with coloring.<br><br> Just in case here is a small reference for Inori's white outfit: http://i.imgur.com/T1S5PVw.jpg </br></br></br>  <br>That's lewd as fuck!</br>  <br>Oh, That was you who asked about feet? I can TRY to tack on some barefeets along with the ahegao version if you'd like. <br><br>I left the boots on because I had to leave at least SOME of her original costume on, kek.</br></br></br>  <br> ahegao version <br>You spoil us! If it's not too much trouble to add bare feet it would be awesome. She's recognizable by her head band regardless. <br>And she's too cute and sexy.</br></br></br>  <br>Boo fucking hoo. Cry more</br>  What did you think of this weeks episode? Is anyone else hoping a super lewd romance develops between Ayame and Tanukichi? Because I sure am!  <br>Where the fuck do I even read the LN/get spoilers.</br>  <br>He would still have to take responsibility at such a young age and he's not attracted to her in any way since she's fucking weird and probably unhygenic</br>  <br>She literally reminds me of the german cunt from Unteralterbach</br>  <br> kawaii as fuck chibis </br>  <br>Probably because the current laws just make dirty talk sound evil.<br>And as we all know, evil means fun.<br>We can compare this to gun laws in America.<br>The story takes place in Japan but it's equivalent is New York  or California or D.C or New Jersey, Commie states etc. <br>The ban on dirty words is like the California banning of "evil features". The features: pistol grip, detachable mag, adjustable stock, threaded barrel, thumbhole stock, for semiauto firearms.<br> no dirty words = NFA/Brady bullshit. <br>The bracelets are like a sneaky form of registration so the govt. knows exactly who has what. This allows the govt. to do the next step.<br> bracelets = registration <br>The govt. now erases all pron and other stuff which is like the ATF coming to your door and taking your guns away while shooting your dog.<br> Confiscation = no funs. <br>As of episode 2, the world they live in is kind of like a firearms equivalent of California.<br>Most comply with the bullshit but some fight the good fight.<br>The law that Anna's mom is trying to pass would be like Fienstein passing a bill that bans Semiautos.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Shitty translation from Chinese (Korean?) scans of 36-37 are out, thanks to Anon.<br><br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!Y8VXSbpS!t6Sm<wbr>aC0ERNrvxmad7Ieg_g<br><br>New episode soon. Try to use spoiler tags for manga discussion, but for anime-only people you are better avoiding the thread altogether.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> what if its "of the dead" rules  </br>  <br> not a doujin with Shovel and his zombie senpai. <br>   fendom </br></br>  <br>Another good one would be that Yuki finally gets her first boyfriend at school. <br> It's actually just a zombie and fucks her till she goes even more insane. </br></br>  <br>Not exactly gentle, but he did translate so I can't complain</br>  <br> his <br>Anon pls don't.</br></br>   being worse than Kirino   <br>I like the image, I don't like you.</br>  <br>Every girl is worse than Kirino.</br>  <br>Every girl is worse than Kirino, what you trying to said with your post?</br>  <br>Keep posting these, OP<br>I still think Nibutani best girl</br></br>  <br>You have shit taste.</br></blockquote>]
