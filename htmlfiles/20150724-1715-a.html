[ I couldn't watch this with /a/. What did you guys thought of it?<br><br>I really enjoyed the whole quantum gimmick but it was confusing as fuck sometimes and had to stop and recollect what had just happened.</br></br>  The janitors left over at Gainax finally made an A+ anime and no one watched it  <br> no one watched it <br>I want to hatefuck to death anyone who dropped or skipped this. Fuck.</br></br>  It was a fun ride and well worth slogging through the first few episodes.<br> Does anyone have that timeline chart? </br>  <br>Found it in the archive.</br>  <br><br>The general consensus of the people that posted in the threads enjoyed it a lot, especially all the science.<br><br>A bunch of people disregarded it though because of giant chunks of Gainax's staff leaving to form a new studio every other year, but I thought this was surprisingly pretty good as a temporary/permanent swan song for Gainax if this really was their last anime.<br><br>All of the heavy science implementation made me think of it as the third -Buster sister and I enjoyed it just as much as the other two.<br><br>The soundtrack is also amazing, especially the piano song from episode 4. Download the soundtrack if you haven't already, it's up on Nyaa. Several other tracks are good as well.<br><br><br>And yeah, the plot sometimes got a little wobbly and I was having trouble with it at some points as well, but I think it all came together in a decent enough shape in the end. Overall, a pretty good experience. Episode 4 really made me love it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It wasn't perfect, but I enjoyed it a whole lot. I wish people like  would calm down though.  <br>Eh. I was a fan since the OVAs. Sorry for the hyperboles.</br>  <br><br>I watched the OVAs just before watching the series and thought they were terrible. The actual series was quite the improvement and I'm glad they expanded on it, since it turned out so well.</br></br>  <br>6/10</br>  Did anyone buy the merchandise for it?<br><br>I did.</br></br>  Didn't watch it because it looked like shit. How did it sell?  The ONA was better. I wish the show was about the girls. I didn't get enough Hikaru, fuck you Gainax with your Minato and space bullshit. Give me Hikaru.  It was my AOTS. I really enjoyed it.  Everyone came to the conclusion that Hikaru was best girl.  <br>To be fair, they were like 5 minutes long and had to introduce about 7 and a half characters, develop two of them through a somewhat believable arc, and explain the whole space faring shit.<br>Every hype I gave to this anime came from how original and simple the premise was.</br></br>  <br>Wrong</br>  I loved it, because I'm a huge bitch for anything with space in it.<br><br>This show made me sad that I'll never be able to warp through space, trying to find lone objects outside the orbits of stars.</br></br>  <br>Hikaru was shafted and became irrelevant after her episode. I'm mad.</br>  <br> pseudo-tomboy that's actually smart as fuck and the most collected/mature of the group <br><br><br> not-shit kuudere that actually has a personality of her own <br><br>They were all great. If anything, Aoi was the worst but she was still nice.<br>Also, not even Gainax gave a shit for Itsuki.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I could understand that, but that's why it just didn't work for me. Thankfully, the full 12 episodes gave it time to expand on all of that and let us get to know the characters and plot.</br></br>  <br>0/10 not enough /o/ memes</br>  The guy ruined any chance for this show.  <br>Minato and Tsubasa were the best thing to happen to each other.<br>I hate waifufags.</br></br>  i LOVE gunbuster,  <br>It's the truth though. Still may not have done great but it would've had more of a chance. Also I'm not a "waifufag".</br>  <br>At being popular?<br>Yeah. I guess you are right.</br></br>  <br>The problem is, Minato did steal my waifu's screentime. What's the point in mahou shoujo without mahou shoujos?</br>  <br><br>/u/shitter please.</br></br>  Wait a minute, Minato wasn't a girl?  <br>According to anime, all cute children look like girls.<br>no pedo tho</br></br>  <br>most underrated show last season. also AOTS</br>  <br>I just want my magical girls.</br>  <br>Last season's hidden gem. It wasn't a masterpiece, but I enjoyed it more than I should have.</br>  <br> Tinkle <br>Then go watch FetishPet, bro.</br></br>  <br>If you want just magical girls then go watch Precure or some shit.<br>Having a guy made this show much more interesting than it would have been without him.</br></br>  <br>Thanks.</br>   tfw you drive a mitsubishi   <br> tfw there will never be more itsuki <br>Y-you're welcome. ;_;</br></br>  <br>Precure has guys too, but it doesn't forget about girls.</br>  <br>Because Precure has 50 episodes for each team of girls.<br>How can you compare a series made with Gainax's mortgage to a franchise whose every installment runs for a whole year each year?</br></br>  The sexiest  Anone hyped for the new Gainax proyect?  <br>What is it?</br>   https://loliquent.wordpress.com/20<wbr>15/07/22/an-update-that-you-may-not<wbr>-like/</wbr></wbr> <br><br> another translator dies <br><br>Why is the LN translation scene such a hopeless and unforgiving place</br></br></br></br>  Fuckers didn't even release 154.  You didn't do enough dicksucking.  <br>But that's impossible.</br>  <br> loliquent.wordpress.com is no longer available <br>FUCK<br><br>Why?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hmm?</br>  So, since the page is down, what was it about?<br>Some default translator rant and then a quit?</br>  <br><br>honestly, I remember a time when I saw this series getting a preview on some slow ass translator site and thinking it was alright.<br><br>Then yoraikun picked it up and I followed it for a bit until I got bored.<br><br>I came back to it earlier this week and it has like 150 fucking chapters. It had 50 when I left it. Seems to me like this series will probably be alright what with the small team of people wanting to translate it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is LoliQ, and right now, I’m a bit angry at some of the leechers that are reading this novel.<br><br>Let me tell you the reason why I made the update table.<br><br>The reason is because people will begin to bother the translation sites/blog for no apparent reason but to simply ask when will THE CHAPTERS BE RELEASED.<br><br>I understand that you enjoyed the web novel: Konjiki no Word Master, and that is the reason I’m giving updates daily so that you won’t have to cause a disturbance on the other sites.<br><br> But seriously, why can’t the others understand this?<br><br> Why can’t some of you simply give their gratitude because this WN is being translated?<br><br> When will you be satisfied with our compromises?<br><br>Some of you are still seriously harassing the other translations sites. Rather, some of your comments have been getting nasty. All because YOU KNOW WHEN THE CHAPTERS WILL BE RELEASED SOON.<br><br>You know who you are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It would seem that some of you are clearly over abusing the information the Update table gives from this blog. So why not just abandon it then? Besides having the table or not, just gives the same scene over and over again.<br><br>Let’s just drop down the Update table. And wait for the chapters, WITHOUT KNOWING WHEN IT WOULD BE RELEASED. I believe it’s better this way.<br><br>Be grateful that the other translators haven’t abandoned or stopped translating this novel, because they are, clearly, fessed up with the harassment you are doing to their blogs.<br><br>Just patiently wait for the chapters.<br><br>Hmph. …Rant Over….</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, default bullshit.<br><br> Let's ignore the grateful readers and focus only on the negative comments to get an excuse and stop translating. And since I'm a big asshole, I'll delete everything without even providing enough time for a backup. Sincerely, yet another stupid translator. </br></br></br>  <br>Google automatically saves and archives any site that can be found on google search. It's still there.</br>  <br>Technically, it's a WN.<br><br>I'm glad I caught up over the last couple days before this happened.</br></br></br>  <br>If you like epubs, drunkenepubs at wordpress seems up to date with this wn</br>  <br>Dude, I'm going to ask you without any malicious intent behind it, so don't take it the wrong way. <br><br>Are you underage? I ask you this as an ex-subber. 90% of your leechers will always be ungrateful pricks or mute people who'll never even acknowledge your name/handle.<br><br>Did no one told you to not take your leechers seriously, ever? When you're in the sub business you have to read the comments in case someone reports a sub fuckup, so I don't know how is it for you LN groups, but shit like NEXT CHAPTER WHEN should always, always be ignored.<br><br>If you've already made up your mind regarding this that's it, but if you ever go back to translating stuff take into acocunt that when you throw hissy fits like this you're only affecting the people who actually give a fuck about your releases.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I actually prefer them.<br><br><br>I know, I just read through some comments in the cached version. But a lot of people don't know.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you a retard?</br>  <br>I don't even understand why they bother with the WN when superior LN versions are out, in most cases.</br>  <br>Woah there, anon I'm just reposting what was in google cache.</br>  <br>Neither Shamoe nor Silva are how I imagined them in my mind.<br>This was I thought was going to be Shamoe (without the crazy)</br></br>  <br>This should teach me to never make serious posts under the influence of sleeping pills. My bad, bro.</br>  <br>LN is totally different from the WN version from what I hear, and they've already invested themselves for like 160 chapters.</br>  <br> bro <br>Stop making excuses retard.</br></br>  <br>I do understand that they already invested a lot of time. But when the project actually started, it had already LN releases. I wouldn't have bothered with the WN at this point.</br>  <br>Equivalent to just 3 volumes.</br>  <br>That's mainly because they don't wanna get fucked over by Yen Press and the like. WN is safer, especially if the WN greatly differs from the LN.<br><br>And LN is not always better than WN, take Shieldbro for example.</br></br></br>  <br>And nothing of value was lost. <br><br>MC was a lazy dick.</br></br></br>  Wait <br><br>https://loliquent2.wordpress.com/20<wbr>15/07/23/i-got-hacked/#comments<br><br>Nigga got hacked <br><br>https://loliquent2.wordpress.com/kn<wbr>w-the-lost-chapters/<br><br>Chapters here.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>That was a troll that took the chapters from google cache and reposted them, claiming to be LQ.</br>  <br>Fuck off web novel fag.<br><br>LN is always better than WN, no exceptions.<br><br>Shieldbro is a very good example of that.<br><br>Also, these chinks and gook translators who don't even live in America somehow being afraid of Yen Press when their normalfag shit brother and sister chink and gooks sub Hollywood TV shows and movies don't give a fuck about Hollywood lawyers, makes then pussy ass niggas.<br><br>Just admit that your web novel translators's real excuse for why they do web novels is because it is easier to copy and paste text from web novels into their shitty machine translators compared to lifting up text from scans of a light novel in comparison.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pfft<br><br>Either way at least the chapters are still up. Download that shit before it disappears.</br></br></br>  <br>Anyone serious about the translation wouldn't be stopped by that.</br>  <br>The chapters were also reposted on http://blazingtranslations.com/2015<wbr>/07/23/loliq-chapters/ and http://konjikiupdate.weebly.com/<br>The latter seems to be a new site that may replace the individual blogs. Comments are disabled on LQ's chapters and the others are still links to the blog posts.</br></wbr></br>  <br> Liking how the original core problems and antagonist is completely dismissed and a former supporting cast member is gender bent and turned into the new main villain <br> Liking the original heroes being completely ignored in favor of random other world heroes  <br> Liking how they turn Raphtalia from a swordsman and later Hammer Hero into a weeb as shit katana user <br><br>Good try shit poster.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Web novel translators are retards, what is new.<br><br>They always whine and complain about getting burned out doing web novel translations despite the fact people warned them in the beginning that they would get burned out and that translating light novels would give them a break since it takes an average 3 to 5 months before a new light novel volume comes out, giving translators a much needed break from burning out.<br><br>Meanwhile, you don't get breaks with web novels since all the web novel raws are already available so you feel pressured with your original promises of one chapter a day, etc, therefore making you feel burned out and higher chances of quitting the project.<br><br>Web novel translators just can't seem to give up on feeding their ego, though, so they don't listen to such advice so I feel zero sympathy from them being hounded by commenters on their blogs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Liking the super edgy web novel version. <br><br>Supreme gentleman detected.</br></br></br>  <br>They are more serious than you at least, and that's all that matters.</br>  <br> giving a shit about 4 instances of edgy executions and ignoring retconning the entire plot to hell <br><br>Hey faggot shouldn't you be working on the next expansion for World of Warcraft? I hear there's still a lot of story to butcher.<br><br>I also like how you can't even cite a single thing the LN does better, not even the objective fact that at least they give pictures. You clearly don't even own them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And here I thought we were having a proper conversation.</br>  <br>Do you actually think your black and white reply fit for a caveman is proper conversation?</br>  <br>Being more pussy than anime subbers makes them less serious because while anime subbers don't give a fuck about anime studios or publishers, web novel translators cower in fear over Yen Press.<br><br>Are you a chink or gook lover or something because web novel translators are known to be scum.<br><br>There have been cases where you they charge 200 hundred dollars for two shitty pages done in google translate.<br><br>I have never heard of a LN translator ever being so Jew in comparison.<br><br>I guess it is because of the difference between machine translators and those that actually tried studying Japanese and having the money to buy the LNs in the first place.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yoraikun is the best translator.<br>Thanks Yorai for finishing shieldbro.</br>  I always felt she/he was cool and didn't cared for the trolls.

Thank God, this series deserves such a fate.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not like they couldn't do it with their usual method.<br>Just get it digitally, remove the DRM, and there it is.<br>There are also sales, currently lots of them go for 215 yen.<br>It shouldn't be a problem.<br><br>But I wouldn't want them to do that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And LN is not always better than WN, take Shieldbro for example. <br>Was the LN ever even translated? I remember the WN started jumping the shark around chapter 90.</br></br>  and nothing of value was lost  <br>It's easier to check 'dictionary' for web novel. Well at least many WN translators are like that.</br>  <br>She should have never allowed comments in the first place but web novel translators are attentionwhores and need those comments.<br><br>Some of the fastest LN translators I know don't even have blogs because it's a waste of time and they are smart enough to avoid having to deal with online commenters.<br><br>Big difference between a pro translator who grew up from having their ego stroked versus a web novel amateur translator who craves e-peen and opens himself or herself to online commenters and leechers.<br><br>If you want to open a blog, go ahead, but just disable commenting and you won't create any future drama.<br><br>As for email, just use a throw away email. <br><br>Web novel translators seem to lack this kind of common sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> while anime subbers don't give a fuck about anime studios or publishers, web novel translators cower in fear over Yen Press <br><br>Likewise, anime studios or publishers don't give a fuck about fantranslations while Yen Press seems to C&amp;D everything.</br></br></br>  <br>Funi C&amp;Ds everything actually. You never saw how they censor Google with their DMCA comment of the bottom of the google search page saying Funi DMCA blah blah.<br><br>Yet fansubbers still don't give a shit about Funi.<br><br>Funi even tried suing but got their case tossed out by the judge.</br></br></br></br></br>  That blogsite was really well done. Full of Lolis.  There are more fun things out there with an actual LN translation.<br>So, who cares?</br>  why is there so much drama surrounding the translating of text on a page?  <br>I'm waiting for the first volume to be translated before I start reading it.</br>  <br>There's no drama.<br>Something like this case is simply always an excuse "translators" use to stop.</br></br>  <br>It's fun.</br>  <br>No idea, there was even this guy that said that he was NTR´d from his translation project from other guy that just picked up a apparently dropped novel about monster taming a while ago</br>  <br>Good to know, I'll be sure to enjoy it later.</br>  https://loliquent2.wordpress.com/20<wbr>15/07/23/bad-news/</wbr>  <br>So it's a ruse to make ever1 afraid</br>  <br><br>Why are translators always giant fucking bitches, who can't deal with any form of negativity or people who don't bend over backwards and praise the fuck out of them?</br></br>  <br>I was catching up in the last days and god damn the dick sucking in those comment section is really cancerous.</br>  <br>Why do leechers keep bitching about translators? <br>Chicken egg problem.</br></br>  <br><br><br>E-peen does things to people, it changes them, corrupts them into melodramatic cunts.<br><br>You'd think they'd just lock the comments section or just get rid of it completely, but nope, most of them love crying and whining to the world.<br><br>Honestly, if you're translating for free, it's for free so don't expect people to owe you anything because it's for FREE and you're doing it voluntarily.<br><br>On the same coin, if you're doing it for free, your audience can't say shit to you because you don't owe them a single cent or favor. Fuck them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because translators keep showing themselves to be big babys, who can't deal with the fact not everyone wants to suck their e-pen dick</br>  <br>Comments are useful for posting of edits</br>  <br>Sky shut the fuck up you fucking faggot holy shit why do you overlocalize Overlord it's like I'm reading a bad Yen Press translation.</br>  Been reading Uchinara<br>So far i love it<br>Damn i love these SOL adventure types<br>Especially when MC adopts an orphan little girl as her daughteru and protecting her</br></br></br>  <br><br>That's why you should have an editor to do that job for you. <br><br>Either you keep the comments section and be a big boy who can stand the fire, or you don't because you can't handle internet people saying mean things.<br><br>It's boils down to them not being able to do their own work because internet people are saying mean things. Think about that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Which one is that one?</br>  <br>I'm going to take a wild guess and say it's Uchinara.</br>  <br>To specifically piss off the autist of course</br>  <br>This intrigues me, gonna look it up to read later.</br>  <br>I was asking for a summary or description, since I hadn't heard about it before. <br>Anyways I found it here's a synopsis for anyone interested.<br>https://natsutl.wordpress.com/proje<wbr>cts/novel-tl/uchi-nara/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>the best part about is father mc taking care of his daughteru</br>  <br> editor <br>editors workiing together with me are amateurs. Good thing about internet is that mistakes can be amended, unlike printed books,<br> work <br>It is a hobby. Translators are part of the community, nothing special about them. Some will rage quit just like regular people.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the main reason I'm picking it up in the first place when I read the synopsis. I'm all for comfy healing.</br>  <br>She's probably older than he is. He's like 18-20 I think it was and Demon race ages apparently really slowly in comparison to humans so.</br>  <br> translator vs. leecher e-drama </br>  <br>Why not make a google docs with comment rights, so anyone can edit but the commits have to be accepted?</br>  <br><br>Sounds like it's asking for 'Editors Note: kawaii desu~'</br></br>  <br>Because rejecting hundreds of troll comments is tiring.</br>  <br>How long until she grows up and decides she wants him to impregnate her?</br>   1000 hours in paint   <br>True, I was trying just now and it seems google love to create lots of commits to check.</br>  <br>10/10</br>  <br>She's a demon race and they apparently age super slowly. MC even has a thought that she might be older than him in first chapter.</br>  <br>That's easy. WN can be copied pasted into machine translate.</br>  <br> rejecting <br> Being this much of a bitch </br></br>  <br>Everyone is different from what i imagined except for Silva.</br>  <br>I never imagined Shamoe having such incredibly fluffy cotton candy drills (4 of them no less). Its almost like someone took Mao from Show by Rock, styled her hair, and threw her in a maid costume. I love it.</br>  <br><br>I thought vamp loli was blonde like the other blonde loli vamp from Blazblue</br></br>  <br>Now that I think about it, most if not all the vampire loli characters that I can think tend to have blonde hair. That's kind of interesting, though I don't claim to know about every vampire loli character, just the more widely known ones.</br>  <br> Akaloli <br> thought she was blonde <br><br>Come on, anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>do it for the act, not for the crowd, shitter.</br>  <br>The author reminds us of her red hair every chance he gets, how the hell did you even maneged to think that?</br>  <br>But she had a butler just like the one from Blazblue and I thought that she was called Akaloli only because she likes wearing red clothes.</br>  <br>That's what I get for spoonfeeding retards.</br>  <br>Now you know.</br>  <br>She's not a vampire.</br>  Guess it's a good thing that I'm following chink translations for WN/LNs, if one dies there's always another person waiting in line to pick translations up.  <br>Is it confirmed? It was the first race that came to my mind after her introduction, but I still haven't caught up with the translation.</br>  <br>Why the fuck are you doing TL work?<br>I mean I do subbing and various other contributions to /a/ but I'm not enough of a prick to expect some sort of gratitude or respect from my downloaders.<br>I do what I do because I genuinely love it.

This is worst shit that 4chan has seen in ages </br>  <br>Damn, son, did you get cucked or something? <br>Actually there's no way that could happen, so I'm guessing you're just pissed about other anons fapping to your shitty husbando huh?</br></br>  <br>But anon-kun, I was shitposting  ironically :^) </br>  <br><br>You know I am. It's almost  like I wish we'd go back to calling each other faggots like civilized people. Nowadays you go to any other board and it's "cuck cuck cuck" </br></br>  <br> No. But I respect the scat fetish shitters more than cuck faggots. </br>  <br> That's saying quite a lot. I don't really have a reply to that. </br>  <br>It was an attempt to bring sonic terrors into anon's reality.</br>  <br>What if I read NTR because I like Netori and fags on Sadpanda can't properly tag so I suffer through netorare to get to the netori.</br>  <br>Caillou has everything to do with NTR.</br>  What are we going to do for an hour, boku gang?  <br>Mope and wait for the return of Aereus "Seven Minutes in Heaven at the 7/11" to translate for us. <br><br>Aereus, what does it feel like to be a meme?</br></br></br>  <br>Is NTR a meme now ?</br>  <br>Closer to half an hour now, I've just been quasi-ironically shitposting. <br><br>You could post lewd tho</br></br></br>  <br>if you don't think this is the cutest moment in the manga you are lying to yourself<br><br>  hottest was when she slammed her phat ass on his dick </br></br></br>  <br> See the problem is that cuck fags are the new pony shitters. They literally inject their fetish into everything. This might literally not be a thread in the last year or so that hasn't had some faggot spouting cuck, ironically or unironically. it was funny when it was about moot, but now the actual fetish faggots are out in full force and you cannot tell who's shitposting anylonger <br><br><br>Then I feel sorry for you.<br><br><br>Yes. Refer to: Moot's departure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    You guys are going to  love  this chapter.  <br>I hate the "cucks" shit, it's fucking everywhere and also people who say "kek". It's so stupid and I don't find any of it funny. I have a friend who says kek out loud all the fucking time, I physically cringe a lot.</br>   I agree cuckposting was funny when it was about the space cuck meme maker former ceo of troll inc. but now the real NTRfags think they are in good company.   <br> Growing up isn't so tough <br> Except when I've had enough </br></br>  <br><br>Pretend to be KoG, apparently.</br></br>  Why cant i find any recent chapters anywhere?  <br>You need to look in the archive for the threads.</br>  Relevant.  <br>Why is Loki so fucking ugly.</br>  <br> トップケク </br>  To tide you over as I finish up~  <br>Love me some Eroe</br>        Wait, Chapter 70 is already out?  <br>Chapter 72 is out ain't it ?</br>  <br>Yeah it was done on Monday.</br>  <br>What about the text below "kiss"?</br>  <br>Well shit</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure the point of it was that it's a better raw + cleaned<br><br><br>Aereus said on his site that it was absent from the latest issue of YJ</br></br></br></br>  <br> Aereus <br>Could you regularly release chapters?

Bokunomanga is still going, right?</br></br>  <br>Try typesetting/cleaning something and showing it to them.</br>    So exactly how far is the manga translated right now? In the treads I see people posting that it's at chapter 70 or something but all of the chapters that I can find are only up to chapter 56.  <br>Those are the fully scanned and cleaned chapters.<br><br>The Aereus threads are where you see they are.</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Dwb<wbr>wvJOx4fw</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>No those are only up to 51, the one up to 56 are the shit ones that caused all that drama a while back, I think.</br>  <br>Live translations are at 71 "now", the actual releases are lagging behind.</br>  <br><br>Ok thanks, I just found the archives.</br></br>  Quick what video player do you use?<br>Windows Classic keeps crashing on me and fuckk vlc.</br>  softnes when?

Takeru, man, you can do better than this.</br></br>  <br> It's been over a year since the change right? <br>At most, it's been only a couple of months. At the beginning of summer break, it had only been like a month or two tops, and this is directly following summer break which is only like a few weeks.</br></br>  <br>It's been a few months.</br>  <br>Indeed. But you have to take the personality of the character into consideration when writing dialogue. Do you think Takeru would say something like "Good day chaps, might you let me listen in on your fine conversation at this time?"</br>  <br> Manga volumes are called tanks for short <br><br>Learned something new.  I thought it was Boku Girl clothing </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, Takeru doesn't explicitly say 'he' but in the absence of pronouns in the Japanese, I figured Takeru wouldn't refer to Mizuki as 'she' yet at this point.

What is your opinion on bugs?  Somebody plays to this game ? because i don't know how unlock skills .  <br>The only likeable ones are Palm, Kite, Welfin, and Colt.</br>  <br>They're called abilities, you unlock them by feeding a copy of a character to themself. So if you had a 5* healer Machine, you'd have to feed her other healer Machis of the same type for a chance to gain the ability. Using a character of the same star rank or higher as food is a guaranteed ability, you could gain an ability by using a lower star rank character as food as well but chances decrease as the difference between the star ranks of the character you're feeding and the character you're using as food increases.<br><br>Feeding a 5* to a 5* = guaranteed ability<br>Feeding a 5* to a 2* = guaranteed ability<br>Feeding a 2* to a 5* = low chance of gaining an ability</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but he does get hurt <br>A few scratches isn't what I'd call "getting hurt"<br> What the fuck are you talking about <br>Pic related. He turned into the bad guy to show that humanity can be cruel too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>thanks anon , you helped me a lot , do you have any trick to have more gemmes ? , because i have just 1/2 gemme per day , it's reallly difficult to drop a copy of a character .</br>  <br> A few scratches isn't what I'd call "getting hurt" <br>Being mostly vaporized by a nuke is not what I'd call "a few scratches".<br> Pic related. He turned into the bad guy to show that humanity can be cruel too. <br>How does that make him "a bad guy"? He was meant to strike fear into the King to show humanity's capacity for destruction far exceeds his ant-like power. Netero and the King are not "good guys" or "bad guys", they are the meant to showcase their races combined potential.</br></br></br></br>  <br> A few scratches isn't what I'd call "getting hurt" <br>He felt pain and was damaged, by definition he got hurt.<br> He turned into the bad guy to show that humanity can be cruel too. <br>Because he made a scary face? He never was a bad guy just like he never was a good guy. He sacrificed himself for his species, but still said he was grateful for all the people who died because it gave him the opportunity to fight Meruem. All he did was what you said, show humanity could be scary.</br></br></br></br>  <br>that's just the face of determination onto one of the most powerful human prepared to die<br>he's in no way a bad guy<br>just like  Meruem wasn't a bad guy </br></br></br>  <br>Netero and Meruem disgust me. Probably the only designs in the manga that I consider ugly.</br>  Chimera Kite is sexy! Sexy!  <br>There has to be some ugly to off set the wiggles.</br>  <br> this shitty forced meme again <br>I really thought you guys left</br></br>  <br>He was still kind of the good guy. Even though the king was changed he was still planning to rule the world. <br><br>Radiation poisoning is what killed him, not "poison". The bomb was a small nuclear bomb.</br></br></br>    <br>What wiggles?</br>  <br>dumb meme 2-3 killuafags have been trying to push for months</br>  <br>the wiggles have been around for over two years, your new is showing</br>  <br>it started in 2015, your lie is showing</br>  <br>Confirmed for shit taste, faggot.<br><br><br> enemies dying because of the bomb/poison felt really anticlimactic. <br><br>You are retarded. You must be some 12 yo faggot, who lack creativity.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If that's what you want to believe.</br>  1999 is best  <br> Confirmed for shit taste, faggot. <br>Yes, your taste has been confirmed as shit.</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't go as far as to call him disgusting, but Meruem has a pretty weird body.<br>I'm curious, what are your favorite designs?</br></br>  Who Torpor here?<br><br>Waiting until hiatus drops.</br></br>  <br> mfw his death <br><br> No one should ever die alone. </br></br></br>  <br>He said he wasn't alone though</br>  <br>legit sorrowed on that part as well.</br>  <br>Why was his hair floating during that power up?<br><br>Rogue Nen gravitons?<br><br> Inb4 nen, ain't gotta explain tits </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That looks like a face that is laughing at death itself, sure Netero was never afraid of death, but that badass MoFo literally laughed at death before his demise as he was atomized.<br><br>It takes enormous amounts of fucking balls to laugh at death without insanity.</br></br></br>  <br>Was that Kite's ulterior motive all along?<br><br>Also, did his Nen abilities change as well?</br></br></br>  <br>If you're starting out, I can tell you that the chances of obtaining character doubles are slim. The pool of characters available in the premium gacha increases every week so you might not see doubles until you've built up a varied collection.<br>Or your next few pulls might all be 6* Kite, it's a matter of RNG at the end of the day.<br><br>There's no real trick to gems other than completing maps and events. Finish story mode if you haven't (blue map screen), try your hand at the events (red map).<br>You could always buy gems, 30 for the low low price of 2000¥!<br>But just try to login in every day, at the very least.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It started much earlier on tumblr, but you Killuafags just started trying to force it here on 4chan in 2015.<br><br>Then you wonder why no one likes you.</br></br></br>  <br>Congratulations, you were full of shit before, but now you proved to me you're full of shit. I'm the one that started it, and I started it in 2013, and I've never once been to tumblr, so it wasn't there that I started it.<br><br>Keep on being new.</br></br></br>  <br> being this proud on creating a tumblr tier meme <br>And yet you're the only who keeps posting it, you created it in 2013 and it still hasn't caught on means that your meme is forced.</br></br>  Snu Snu time mother fuckers!  I don't know why but Silva Zoldyck slightly reminds me of Bowie, msut be the badass hair.  <br>Problem with your point is that I usually only lurk in HxH threads unless some actual discussion happens, which sadly usually only happens when Green is around, and I still see it posted in every single HxH thread. So basically you're just outright wrong.</br>  <br>P-Pls! <br><br><br>Rude.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then you must have been around every thread, because it just started being posted by 1-2 Killuafags after people started reporting <br>post. And that's only when the Killuafags are out.</br></br>  <br>What are you talking about?  only started getting reported recently (see: last two months) and I made this image (  ) in March.<br>Not even that guy, but why does this matter to you so much?</br></br>  <br>What's the point in lying about this?</br>  <br>It doesn't, someone asked why the meme was forced and I answered. It doesn't get posted in every thread and recently Killualust tends to get reported, and even before then it wasn't posted in every thread.</br>  <br>Okay, and I was just clearing up that the wiggle shit wasn't supposed to replace the Killua is cute! shit. I don't care for the wiggle meme, I just make stuff for it. So that wasn't the intention.</br>  <br>ok , thanks a lot</br>  Machi best girl.  <br>Sorry to say the meme took off on tumblr, and tends to invite Killualust which kills discussion. It's kind of why the "KIllua is cute!" meme overstayed its welcome.</br>  I want Togashi to write some anime original movies. His Kuruta backstory was promising, it's a shame Badhouse butchered it and turned it into the KilluGon hour.  <br>Togashi's creative and competent enough to be able to write and direct his own movies.<br><br>But I don't think he's interested.</br></br></br>  <br>At the moment Shuiesha currently has a contract with BadHouse to produce the anime. They have to wait for the contract to expire before they can get another studio to to adapt the work. So either way Togashi won't be writing the script for any movies anytime soon.</br>  <br><br><br> reading the manga <br>Why would I pick up something on permanent hiatus.<br>I could just read Berserk if I hated myself that much.<br>Also Togaki's art a shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>0/10</br>  <br> hiatus <br> permanent <br><br>A permanent hiatus is a canceled manga. Also 0/10</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would you watch something on permanent hiatus? It's the same fucking series, just ignore the chapters from after the anime.<br><br>Or don't, and stay a filthy secondary. The art is shit for a period of time but the rest is pretty good with nice paneling and composition, and morons who refuse to read the source material don't know that.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh wait, ignore my serious response. I just realized you haven't even read Berserk, jesus christ.</br>  <br>The only time the art was ever shit was in that KiteKoala chapter he never redrew.</br>  <br>Majority of readers only purchased the Jump issues so most of his audience haven't even witnessed his revised napkin drawings. The man really had no excuse but utter lack of respect for his fans. Though I guess chronic laziness makes you apathetic to peoples feelings.</br>  <br> makes you apathetic to peoples feelings. <br>Ironic, considering you're completely ignoring his feelings. He has health issues.</br></br>  <br>where are some assistants to aid him through it then?</br>  <br>Hard to say, but the guy has never worked with them even when in health.</br>  <br>Isn't it because he just wants to do it all himself?</br>  <br>did he have assistance for the last 9 chapters or do it all himself?<br><br>he's probably working on more</br></br></br>  <br>Actually in the case of HxH it's popular because of it's volume releases.</br>  <br>As you should OP, as you should.</br>  <br>Shit man, he's as bad as Gon when it comes to his pride.</br>  I see no difference  <br>It's pretty stupide , if he changes nothing , his manga will never finish , it makes no sense .</br>  <br>Remember the shitstorm when Kubo put a random reference to YYH in Bleach?</br>  Reminder that Hisoka is just as good as a ninja without nen  If have a few questions regarding Leol's Rental Pod if anyone can provide answers<br>1) If Leol borrows Chrollo's Bandit's Secret, Would he have access to all of the stolen nen abilities that Chrollo took?<br>2) If Leol borrows Chrollo's Bandit's Secret and steals a nen ability himself, would Chrollo have access to that nen ability that Leol took provided he gets the book back?</br></br>  <br>Does Leol's ability keep the person he "borrowed" from from using their nen while he's using it? I mean does he actually steal the power like Chrollo or just copy it temporarily? If so, I'd say yes and yes. If not, no and no.</br>  <br><br>Isn't there a new artist for DC arc? The art looks nothing like his previous chapters.</br></br>  <br>He copies it temporarily. Once used the ability goes back to the original nen user I believe.</br>  <br> Isn't there a new artist for DC arc? <br>How stupid and new do you have to be to think this?</br></br>  <br>"Killua is cute!" did not start on tumblr either though.<br><br>I don't get why killualust gets reported.</br></br></br>  <br>No the wiggle one did though, but they do still gush about "Killua is cute". Both memes didn't take off over here but rather on tumblr, then you have people trying to force it.<br><br>Because there's a thread for that, and a lot of the time they tended to do it while people were in middle of a discussion which would then result in the discussion dying, when they all spammed the thread. Anon was just fine with it, but then it got really old when they would spam the same pictures and phrases over and over again, so anon got tired of it and asked them to stop. The Killuafags wouldn't stop, so anon started reporting it.<br><br>Long story short, Killualust gets reported because of Killuafags.</br></br></br></br></br>  Do we know for a fact Gyro was turned into a Chimera Ant? Or is there a chance that he escaped?  <br>Yes, the wiki states it.<br>"His tenacity and pride as a former king allowed him to keep all of his human memories and break free of the Chimera Ant Queen's control, vacating her domain.[1] His malevolence and determination are second to none and now, having been reborn as a different species, is completely disconnected from the human race."</br></br>  <br>read the damn manga</br>  <br>Hisoka is really overated , people thinks he's strong like Kuroro or Silva because he wants to challenge them , but Hisoka wants to challenge literally everybody , if he would meet the king , he would want to fight him .<br>Hisoka is strong like Phinks or Razor , but he's not TopTier.</br></br>  <br>I find weird that as the king he is supposed to mate with females of other species yet he seems to lack sexual organs. Or is it his sting?</br>  <br>His tail is the D. When he hit Pitou with it he basically cock slapped her.</br>  <br> her </br>  <br>I think it was stated that Hisoka only challenges people he knows he can beat.</br>  <br> her </br>  <br>No , he wants to challenge Netero .</br>  <br>FUCK YOU</br>  <br>I kind of felt the same away about the bomb, but in retrospect, I just chalk that up to being in 'DBZ mode' from years of cookie-cutter shonens whenever I see a hype battle, I came to appreciate and love the way the fight ended. It really drove home the powerful reality that no other creature will be able to destroy. and sequentially, conquer like humans. The boot was always above these creatures that spent a whole arc fucking shit up and selling us as unstoppable.</br>  <br>he died. who cares?</br>  <br>Which one?</br>  <br> her <br>more like b*tch</br></br>  The best part of the bomb was that it was so anticlimactic. Here is the most powerful being in the world, a truly unique existence and he gets destroyed by a cheap, mass produced nuclear bomb. It's romantic as fuck.  <br>Kill drew the gap that short because he didn't want to leave the country in order the finish drawing Gon's line.</br>  <br> He knows he can beat Netero </br>  <br>As a nen user Hisoka could wreck him with his aura alone.</br>  <br>It's good to question the laws of nen</br>  <br>You should take into account that Kil didn't even know about Nen at the time. So he's only guaging physical abilities.</br>  How would you beat this guy without sound?<br>He can literally bounce off any attack. How would Meruem win?</br>  <br>He wouldn't.</br>  Best Chimera Ant<br> Seriously, what the fuck was he? </br>  <br>pulverized.</br>  <br>That's funny anon but  he's from the dark continent </br>  <br>That looks like the sort of creature I would expect to see in some Monster Sex hentai video.</br>  <br><br>Well he DID get fisted.</br></br>  <br>10/10</br>  <br>what'd you know about the dark continent?</br>  <br><br>Easy. His defence was purely against enhancers. <br><br>Meruem would see his hair has tiny gaps between it and throw a stone at hyper sonic speeds. <br><br>Or just punch so hard the guy dies from the shock wave. He wasn't exactly durable and only showed his skills against a guy who was literally the most retardedly physical enhancer ever.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I heard it from a friend.</br>  <br> Easy. His defence was purely against enhancers.  <br>But that's wrong.</br></br>  <br>tell your friend to hurry tf up and tell you more</br>  <br>Let me just finish this dragon quest game real quick</br>  <br>need a back massage?</br>  <br>It really was, and it's annoying to see shounenbabbies complain because they wanted a big battle instead.</br>  <br>Yeah, I don't know much about how Jump runs except for what Bakuman taught me, but doesn't HxH do badly in rankings?

And then he brings back Gon's ability with deus ex powers, fucking kek.<br>You're really so used to simple minded shit that you think the cheapest tricks are "the best writing" my sides<br><br><br>So they use it only once, out of nowhere? Sounds great, not to mention all the other criticisms your desperate ass was too stupid to even touch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'd say that because Hisoka rated him a 95.<br><br>A 100 would mean that the enemy is almost equal or slightly stronger than him. <br><br><br>While Chrollo wasn't trying to kill them, I'd say Zeno could do serious damage to him on an open area because he could use dragon dive.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Woah there nigger, calm down. I'm not desperate, it's just rational thought. Plus, if what this guy  said is true, they've used it before. What are you expecting? Using something out of nowhere is not the same thing as Deus ex machina.</br>  <br> desperate deus ex nonsense <br>Both the covenants and nukes were established to exist, i do agree with you about Alluka though. At least Gon still hasn't recovered his nen.</br></br>  Why did he have to kill of the guy with Jew-Fu?  <br>So if we assume Netero is a 100, is he only 5 points above Illumi? His ranking system is pretty weird</br>  <br>What if 100 is Hisoka himself, then Netero might be 200 or something</br>  <br> Woah there nigger, calm down. I'm not desperate <br>I apologize for my rudeness my friend<br> , they've used it before <br>This is exactly why I think it's deus ex machina. He pulled it straight from that common bag of writer's hail mary cliches. He mentioned it a bit earlier just in case it would come in handy. Be honest, do you really think it was wise to end it so stupidly after such a painfully long process as the Chimera Ant Arc? Even if you think mureum's death was decently done, do you really buy the way he used the fallout from the bomb and Gon's magical power up to wrap things up so nicely? It just reeks of asspull</br></br></br></br>  <br>hisoka has a pretty strong ability, none of the nen users that know about it want to fight him,h and there's the fact we've never seen hisoka fight all out. For all we know he could have more abilities he's hiding</br>  <br>D.E.M: an unexpected power or event saving a seemingly hopeless situation, especially as a contrived plot device in a play or novel.<br><br>Everyone was already driven into a corner, how else were they supposed to get out of it? Extend the arc even longer to wait for the Zodiac and other OP hunters to arrive and possibly save the day?</br></br></br>  <br> do you really think it was wise to end it so stupidly after such a painfully long process as the Chimera Ant Arc? <br>Yes, I really loved what Togashi did there.</br></br>  <br> do you really think it was wise to end it so stupidly after such a painfully long process as the Chimera Ant Arc?  <br>Did you not notice all the other intentional anticlimaxes?<br> fallout from the bomb <br>How is that an asspull? It makes perfect sense, it's just completely unexpected.<br> Gon's magical power up <br>Please don't tell me you believe that's an asspull. It's almost entirely explained during the beatdown.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Everyone was already driven into a corner, how else were they supposed to get out of it? <br>That's the writer's fault for making mureum so ridiculously overpowered to begin with.</br></br>  <br> A 100 would mean that the enemy is almost equal or slightly stronger than him.  <br>Are you just pulling shit out of your ass now? We have no idea how he ranks people, other than them being fun to fight</br></br>  <br>there was no "deus ex machina" with gons "magical powerup" as you refer it.<br><br>It was a Nen contract, how can you get that far in the series and no understand nen?<br><br>Right when they showed nen they showed how strong it could be with kurapika</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>True it is due to the writer. But would you want a weak villain? I was just so surprised when the fallout killed him, because I honestly didn't see it coming, and I love being surprised. What makes it even better is that it actually made sense, it's not like Gon when SSJ2 and killed Meruem, because I honestly thought that's where it was going; I couldn't think of a way to kill him.</br>  So, what are the odds that the reason they're separated from the dark continent is to keep nen locked away?<br>Things from the dark continent seem to go haywire when in contact with nen. The ants, Nanika.<br>I don't see why the watchers let anyone out at all, but I suppose they might just want to limit it a bit.</br></br>  <br>Anything anyone says about it is pulling it out of their asses since it's never explained. Honestly, ranking himself at 100 makes sense to me. It could be wrong, whatever.<br><br><br>yeah I'd say it's borderline deus ex machina, except that Gon has (for now anyway) lost his Nen abilities.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Alluka is a deus ex machina and so is Gon being healed.<br><br>Gon san is not because it followed the nen rules regarding vows and limitations established in Yorkshin. The nuke is not because it's just a cheap fucking nuke and we know bombs exist in the HxH universe. Resolutions that surprise you =/= deus ex machina. <br><br>They are some of the best writing in the series for how they resolved Gon's character arc and the arc's themes respectively.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is what I think as well, couldn't be said better.</br>  <br>nice buzzwords there kid<br><br>the summerfags really are here in full force</br></br></br>  <br> it's borderline deus ex machina <br>How is along established rule of nen in way a deus ex machina?</br></br>  <br> It was a Nen contract, how can you get that far in the series and no understand nen? <br>You're under the assumption that, once something is established, the extent to which it works is unlimited, which is completely stupid. It felt forced and out of place, even in a shonen, and that's because he's pushing the rules of the world he has written, and that's a sign of execrable laziness in a world as fantastical as this.<br><br><br> It's almost entirely explained during the beatdown. <br>His dismal explanations and factual close ups don't serve to make the situation any less probable. He's basically taking an idiotic series of events and slowing it down to fake a sort of conformity to the rules of the hxh universe. <br> Did you not notice all the other intentional anticlimaxes? <br>It was really a clumsy mix of climaxes and anti climaxes the tone of that entire arc was tedious and abysmal.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You do realise that was the entire reason the bomb was an effective way to kill him, right? The point of it would be completely lost if he was just mid tier. It would be a weak way to kill, say, Hisoka or the troupe, but using something so mundane, cruel and normal without any magic to kill the strongest being on the planet, who was born to rule over everything? Yeah, there's actual intent and meaning behind that.<br><br>Togashi could've just had Netero win the fight and it would've been fine. He was hyped enough that nobody would question it. But he used the bomb for thematic purposes.</br></br></br>  <br>Your taste is beyond shit, and your argument don't even makes sense.</br>  <br><br>I'm still conflicted on whether or not Alluka is an asspull. Alluka was shown a few times long before the CA arc even started, though it never showed her face, and the dark continent was hinted at with Ging having possibly been there, both of those set up for Alluka being from the DC, though the hints of that didn't come until after the fact, so it's hard to say. Two things in favor of it not being an asspull, with a third that happened afterward to explain it, so the way I see it, it was set up, but the nail in the coffin didn't come until after, so it could still be an asspull.</br></br>  <br>It wasn't really unlimited though. He just aged up to where he would be strong enough to beat Pitou, wasting all his potential. Alluka being able to heal him is the retarded part.<br><br>I don't think there is a good way to have killed the king, while still claiming he is the perfect being. The nukes ex machina was the only real solution. I mean you could argue that he wrote himself into a corner, and that it's a bad thing, but eh. I think it's all set up to show that nen combined with the dark continent creates a sort of divinity.</br></br></br>  <br>Alluka is not an asspull. Nanika is.</br>  <br> You're under the assumption that, once something is established, the extent to which it works is unlimited <br><br>what the fuck are you talking about? Nen power is directly tied to the rules around it, the stricter the rules the more powerful the ability <br><br><br>There's no "rule pushing" he completely following the rules</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tomayto tomoto potaytoe potaughto</br>  <br>Eh. Alluka was an asspull. Or rather, Killua being able to order her to do things for free was bullshit.<br>Alluka in herself wasn't bad, getting a being from the dark continent to abuse your nen to give you a great nen power, or enhance a nen power he might already have had. Eh, I dunno.</br></br>  <br>First of all I said borderline, if all Gon needed was a 2 month stay in the hospital it'd be bullshit. That nen rule just seems like a bullshit power to me, even though the idea of some sort of equivalent exchange makes sense, the problem is that it's hard to define what makes the sacrifice equivalent to the power.</br>  <br>The power is what's being sacrificed.</br>  <br>that rule has been around since nen got fucking created, did you find kurapikas power bullshit?</br>  <br>I don't know, sacrificing 80+ years of your life and all of your latent power to reach your peak for a few minutes seems like a fair deal to me.</br>  <br>That's why I said "had Gon not lost his nen abilities" it would have been bullshit</br>  <br>implying Kuroro could actually get hit by a dragon dive</br>  <br> Your taste is beyond shit, and your argument don't even makes sense. <br> ad hom shit <br>Take a breather friendo :^)<br><br><br> You do realise that was the entire reason the bomb was an effective way to kill him, right?  <br>It was only needed because of the stupid amount of power Togashi bestowed upon him? A level of power that is completely out of keeping and tone with the series up to that point. He wrote an absurd villian in order to hype things up, and then killed every one of them off in clumsy "surprises" which were really just hasty asspulls, previously touched upon for credibility. The nen pact that Gon pulled out of his ass was especially deplorable, with it Togashi forced himself to either end the series, follow a different main character, or opt out with shitty deus ex nonsense.<br> But he used the bomb for thematic purposes. <br>Yes this is obvious, but his platitudinous ideas are no excuse for fucking up an otherwise well written Shonen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually when you get down to it, the only real asspull is Killua being able to bypass the rules. A character showing up with only minor foreshadowing is no big deal and not an asspull in itself, and her powers are so dangerous that they aren't an asspull either. It's just Killua getting free reign of them.<br><br>That said it all depends on the DC arc. Nanika is obviously an ai, I assume it's relation to love/desire is why Killua can do that, and if she causes enough conflict I wont have a problem with her role healing Gon. It's feasible that Gon needing healing was an excuse to introduce Alluka (rather than Alluka being an excuse to save Gon). Logically, Gon could have just lost his nen and that would be a fair sacrifice for Gon san. He didn't have to nearly die if Togashi couldn't figure how to save him.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm just saying it's bullshit because it involves typical shonen tropes of bravery and resolve or whatever the fuck to become OP when fighting only 10 specific people. <br><br><br>Makes sense, I'm just saying that since it's never specifically stated that 80 years will multiply my effective power by some number, it's definitely very hand wavy.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>  Finished <br>  Hiatus X Hiatus <br><br>We haven't even boarded the boat yet... <br><br>Also, nice and subtle troll. I like it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is he really meant to be called "Chrollo Lucilfer", or did someone fuck up with the translation yet again?<br>Lucifer is lucifer, and I thought Kuroro fit because kuro is black</br>  Nanika an asspull? although i can see where you're coming from, Nanika is more a precursor to the DC arc and showing theres powers other than Nen at play in HxH.  <br>You don't seem to understand a writer's mindset at all. Not even legitimately bad writers letalone Togashi would write a character like Meruem without considering how to beat him. And if they couldn't figure it out, they wouldn't resort to a bomb because it's a battle shounen about magic. And if they did resort to a bomb that coincidentally illustrated the arcs themes, creates a meaningful anticlimax, and allows a full resolution of his relationships with other characters, then that writer would have to be a fucking genius for being able to pull it out of their ass right at the end of an arc.</br>  The part they're trying to save the queen absolutely disgust me, I would've decimate the whole goddamn nest  <br> riding togashi's dicks this hard </br>  <br>Chrollo is canon romanization from the author himself.</br>  <br> It was only needed because of the stupid amount of power Togashi bestowed upon him? A level of power that is completely out of keeping and tone with the series up to that point. <br>Not really, we didn't know exactly how powerful he was, he could have killed him with Zero Hand or against the buddha.<br> "surprises" which were really just hasty asspulls, previously touched upon for credibility <br>How exactly are they asspulls? I'm curious, i really don't understand your reasoning.<br> The nen pact that Gon pulled out of his ass <br>Again, i don't see how that was asspulled at all. Gon was clearly in a suicidal mindset.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And if they couldn't figure it out, they wouldn't resort to a bomb because it's a battle shounen about magic. <br> It's so stupid that it must have been intentional and therefore not stupid <br>Don't confuse intentionality with acceptability. <br> then that writer would have to be a fucking genius  <br>For drawing upon the common writers' bag of cliches? <br>The very convenience of that all-too-easy asspull is exactly what indicts the Chimera Ant Arc as hackwork. It's a mark of bad intentions and unreality, the fact that every even is so easily connected and dismissed.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Killua bypassing the condition to use Nanika almost feels like foreshadowing to me. Things from the DC shouldn't be inherently evil, even if they kill humans who go there, you would kill a spider on your desk too. It makes me wonder if Alluka and Nanika bonding and caring for each other, and Alluka loving Killua is the reason that Killua can bypass the rules, like maybe the calamities from teh DC are only being called calamities because they're not understood, and there can be a peaceful resolution.</br>  <br><br>Now imagine when they are in the boat.</br></br>  <br> and there can be a peaceful resolution <br>Like with the ants, you mean?</br></br>  <br> The very convenience of that all-too-easy asspull is exactly what indicts the Chimera Ant Arc as hackwork. <br>What asspull? The nuke? Radiation poisoning? The nen contract? None of these are asspulls, because they were established previously. At best you can say you didn't like them or that you didn't expect it, but they're not asspulls.<br><br>I swear to god people come up with the weirdest shit to complain about this arc.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'd say that because Hisoka rated him a 95. <br>He didn't rate Illumi.</br></br>  <br>I would say the resolution with the ants was about as peaceful as it could have possibly been, and if Meruem had lived longer and had time to become more mature, fighting may have been avoided all together.</br>  <br>It's not stupid at all though, as anons have explained over and over to you. It has significant meaning for the arc and the characters involved. It is logically possible within the universe. It was a good climactic moment with some nice shock value for the sake of entertainment. It was convenient indeed and that's because it was a well planned way to resolve the arc. <br><br>You have yet to give a convincing reason as to why he shouldn't have used it. It just surprised you and you probably wanted a big tactical win instead because that's how HxH usually does things.</br></br></br>  <br> it involves typical shonen tropes of bravery and resolve or whatever the fuck to become OP when fighting only 10 specific people. <br>Yes, but it's shown under a different light. Kurapika seems borderline suicidal, and when things become more complicated than the "typical shonen tropes" his morals become very conflicted.</br></br>  <br>I think one of his points is why should Gon even in his suicidal mindset even have reached the original King's power, he's just fucking lucky enough that whatever life and power he sacrificed was enough. It could have been less than Pitou's power, couldn't it have been? The author just chose it to be more, so that Gon could finally get his revenge. Yes, it does follow the rules of nen, but that equivalent exchange rule doesn't really have limits, given that all Gon had to do was get really angry and want to die, or not care about dying. It's the basic shonen principle, if I really want it and try I can get it.</br>  <br> entire manga up to this point hyping up gons potential <br> he achieves it <br> "its just an asspull that he became strong enough to beat pitou" </br></br></br>  <br> What asspull? The nuke? Radiation poisoning? The nen contract <br>All of them. Explain them all to you, then<br> nuke <br>Hardly touched upon, completely out of sight and out of mind. The entire arc was "built up" to a supposedly intentional anti-climax, which is already poor writing because it sacrifices entertainment for childish themes in a fucking shonen, not to mention the fact that the creation of the Chimera ants was, as I've said, out of keeping with tone of the series up to that point. There was no hard work required here, since he made it impossible to do from beginning. No strategy; just the bomb, which wouldn't be so deplorable had Togashi not extended the reach of that attack to the others, thereby making it completely unbelievable. <br> the contract <br>Completely stupid. With these rules, even a small child with potential could kill Chrollo Lucilfer, should he be willing to sacrifice. Well, I say "sacrifice," what I really mean is fake a sacrifice in order to create a false atmosphere and then restore everything with Killua's relative. <br> established previously <br>Touched upon, not at all established.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gon was said since forever to have huge amounts of talent, it's natural that he would become that powerful.</br>  <br>30 points.</br>  <br>Surprise surprise, Gon's potential was big enough after it had been emphasized over and over since the beginning of the series as one of his main traits. He also had enough resolve after an arc's worth of him having an emotional breakdown over the situation. <br><br>Literally any battle in any series is decided by the author just wanting one person's power to be stronger than another's.</br></br></br>  <br>forgetting about the unlimited potential a 13 year old boy sacrificed in order to exact revenge for his friend/mentor.<br><br>typical shonen right?<br><br><br>i can understand someone saying the nuke was an assail, as it wasn't mentioned before, but hxh being a spontaneous anime? naw b</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>where? Quwrof is what's used most</br>  <br>Ok ok I know. <br><br>I'm sick of this arguing, I'm just gonna stop it's going nowhere.<br><br>Let's speculate on Ging's powers instead. Do you think he's a specialist? In the few manga chapters after the anime stopping point, did he actually   copy Leorio's attack because that is one of Ging's powers, or is Ging just very adept and once he sees an attack being done he can visualize how to do it himself?  </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why doesn't everyone do shit like that? Why couldn't pitou do something similar?</br>  <br> but that equivalent exchange rule doesn't really have limits, given that all Gon had to do was get really angry and want to die, or not care about dying. It's the basic shonen principle, if I really want it and try I can get it. <br>Exactly what I've been getting at.</br></br>  <br>Oh, i guess that's fair enough, i can see it now. But we did know that Gon had incredible potential, Wing said something among the lines of one in ten millions i believe. Considering the ants ate at most 500,000 people, it puts things in perspective.<br>If it could have been less than Pitou's power, why couldn't it have been more?</br></br>  <br><br><br>You win I quit</br></br></br>  <br> as it wasn't mentioned before <br>Yes, it was.</br></br>  <br> even a small child with potential could kill Chrollo Lucilfer <br><br>yes he could, if he knew how to use nen and made the right contract, this has been the case since we saw kurapikas power</br></br></br>   http://www.quotev.com/quiz/2088656<wbr>/What-is-your-Nen-type/</wbr> <br>Post nen types, and if you want post your nen ability</br>  <br> If it could have been less than P power, why couldn't it have been more <br><br>Yeah since it's up to the author writing his protagonists as powerful people, he wouldn't write a story about some guy with amazing potential and then kill him off in that manner. You win</br></br></br>  <br>He explained it as being able to copy simple techniques if he gets hit by them, he seems like a genius though, and it probably has to do with how good he is at manipulating his nen. <br>No fucking clue what category he is, it doesn't feel like his personality points to anything specific</br></br>  <br>Pitou wasn't as buttmad as Gon and was completely willing to die anyway if it meant Gon was out of the picture. And she was probably at peak power to begin with.</br>  <br>pitou DID you fucking retard<br><br> has literally no head <br> uses nen to increase her strength and speed after being dead in one last attempt to kill gon <br><br>she ripped off his arm remember? or did you even watch/read it</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why doesnt Leorio have his own arc? i mean i get he wants to be a doctor, but he's been completely neglected in these series, my only qualm. Togas himself even said he's a MC, so whats with him being shelved?  <br>Because they don't have enough "determination" and/or talent. Where did you get that she couldn't?</br>  <br>These have to be the most autistic questions I've ever read<br>*fufu*</br></br>  <br>Yeah that never happens</br>  <br>I honestly wouldn't want him to be a specialist, unless part of becoming a specialist is just becoming so good through constant training, rather than just the luck of being born with it, like Pitou.   luck vs pluck   In the end it doesn't matter I guess.</br>  <br>postmortem grudge-nen isn't the same as what Gon did</br>  <br>here's your reply</br>  <br>Because he doesn't have much of a back story</br>  <br><br><br><br> all these people don't remember pitou doing exactly that after she got her head mashed in  <br><br>no wonder some of you think gon-san was an ass pull, you dont even watch this anime</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most people don't have Gons potential<br>Most people don't have the determination to just throw away any chance at a future<br>Most people aren't that fucking angry. Remember, emotions do a lot to nen.</br></br></br>  <br>She seemed pretty determined to me, enough to chop off Gon's arm from beyond the grave. Using the "well she didn't know you could do that" is such a bullshit plot device</br>  <br>Did you quote the wrong post or something?</br>  <br>Also he's the dedicated meme character right?<br><br>I think he'll get serious plot time when the manga continues since he'll be heading to the dark continent, while Gon will be taking more of a backseat (maybe?) since he lost his nen. Although Gon is supposed to be finding what he wants to do, so I don't know how much will be focused on Gon.</br></br></br>  <br>the anime is finished you fucking retard</br>  <br>No she didnt. It's stated she was so determined her en attacked on its own or something. Imagine how powerful she would have been if she used even a moderate restriction contract.</br>  <br>Forgot to add that Killua will probably also take the backseat since he's just traveling with Alluka or whatever her name is. Maybe a chapter or 2 on their own adventure if anything connects to the main plot. Kurapika and Leorio are and should get more plot, they were left behind for the whole ant arc afterall</br>  <br> es he could, if he knew how to use nen and made the right contract, this has been the case since we saw kurapikas power <br>The "case" is so broad that nearly anything could have been justified, at least in retrospect, with Gon's bullshit asspull taken into context. It's just poor writing across the board.</br></br>  <br>But did you at least think it was fun? I thought it was fun</br>  <br> But did you at least think it was fun? I thought it was fun <br>No, he sacrificed all the rules of the show and made a joke of everything for a childish "message." (I've got half of you telling me it was "oh so deep and for the message" and the other half saying it was stupid fun now)<br>I just didn't like it at all tbh</br></br></br>  <br><br>I think Togashi will focus more on Ging this arc if anything</br></br>  <br> Most people don't have the determination to just throw away any chance at a future <br><br>That's exactly what pitou did. Once she figured out Gon would only last minutes longer in that form she just gave up and was content in him using that power on her instead of the king. She could have stomped Gon by making a moderate contract like "I can only fight when protecting the king" and would have got a good power boost.</br></br></br>  <br>Because Kurapika, someone that trained for less than a year in nen can do it, but a theoretical children that could have more talent and training doing that is bullshit? I really don't understand you.</br>  Why does Youpi resemble a human? Isn't he supposed to be full Magical Beast?  <br>Do you not see his bottom half?</br>  <br> he sacrificed all the rules of the show <br>How do you even breath?</br></br>  <br>He didn't look as human in the manga. Not at first, at least.</br>  <br>How do you? *breathe</br>  <br> ecause Kurapika, someone that trained for less than a year in nen can do it, but a theoretical children that could have more talent and training doing that is bullshit? I really don't understand you. <br>Rules were never clearly established, so people think that somehow this counts as justification for nearly anything.<br><br><br> mouthbreathing mongoloid can't counter <br> "y-you dumb" <br>feels good that I'll never be as retarded as you tbh, you probably thought that snarky little cliche was even clever lel</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this... <br>I binge watched this series and it was 2 am at night when it happened and I was literally crying for an hour. I was never impacted this hard by any fictional work in my life.</br></br>  <br> Hardly touched upon, completely out of sight <br>So yeah, unexpected. Would you have prefered an in-depth explanation of how nukes work before the fight?<br> and out of mind. <br>Not at all, did you really not think to yourself "why don't they just nuke them?"<br> which is already poor writing because it sacrifices entertainment for childish themes in a fucking shonen <br>I don't know, i found it entertaining. If you have a problem with the themes, again, that's a case of you not liking it and not something wrong in itself.<br> No strategy; just the bomb <br>Again, nothing inherently wrong with it. Netero wanted something that would guarantee Meruem's death because it was his mission, and was prepared to die for it.<br> which wouldn't be so deplorable had Togashi not extended the reach of that attack to the others, thereby making it completely unbelievable.  <br>What exactly is unbelievable in people getting radiation poisoning from hanging out around the crater of a nuke?<br><br> Completely stupid. With these rules, even a small child with potential could kill Chrollo Lucilfer, should he be willing to sacrifice. <br>Yeah, that's exactly what Kurapika did. I'm not sure if you were trying to be ironic, but Kurapika only was able to touch Chrollo because of his restrictions, he only had learned nen 6 months prior.<br> Well, I say "sacrifice," what I really mean is fake a sacrifice in order to create a false atmosphere and then restore everything with Killua's relative.  <br>I don't see how that's relevant to the discussion at all, and Alluka didn't "restore everything".<br><br> Touched upon, not at all established. <br>Nukes existing, the rules of nen and Gon having a lot of potential weren't established? Please define what makes something "touched upon" and not "established".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It didn't sacrifice anything you fucking moron. You haven't come up with one good point about why it's bad writing except that you didn't like it. We get it, you were surprised and you prefer the tactical aspects of nen. That doesn't mean favouring emotional impact and thematic depth (that is not childish by battle shounen standards) over strategy while still obeying the in universe rules is bad writing at all.</br>  <br>He got himself some sick shorts, it seems.</br>  <br>I'm talking of his feet mainly</br>  <br>I don't think he sacrificed any rules of the show, the rules were just never specified enough that they could be bent. I still liked it anyway.<br><br><br>The ants probably didn't know about the contract, since useless arrow boy didn't tell them I think. It's possible she subconsciously used some sort of contract at the end, though.<br><br><br>That's true, but I hope the others get screen time. They're part of the Zodiacs and since they have Beyond, both groups will clash eventually maybe.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Rules were never clearly established <br>You're retarded, it was clearly established, we even see Kurapika do it and Gon followed it perfectly.</br></br>  <br>Sort of. The ants didn't have that much knowledge of nen though, and even if she could do a vow like that, how good would it be? The royal guards are literally born for the king, they are always with the king and they always protect him, so would she really gain power from doing a vow that changes nothing about how she normally operates? It sounds like it would be a limiting thing so it should work, but at the same time it wouldn't limit anything for her.</br>  <br>It doesn't irritate you that the royal guards were hyped to hell and then shat on, especially pitou? Then the Gon assault to top it off.</br>  <br> he sacrificed all the rules of the show <br>What did he sacrifice? The rules were "the bigger the sacrifice/restriction, the bigger the power boost".</br></br>  <br>I don't cry often but I usually tear up in my mind and feel sad, it really struck me in a place<br><br><br>Speaking of shorts, did anyone else really dislike Gon's short shorts until you got used to it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't the anticlimax the whole point?</br>  <br>I liked the war of the worlds ending, though. since they were so hyped up and powerful, there was honestly no feasible way to kill them without going full Gon (dfferent anon)</br>  <br> did anyone else really dislike Gon's short shorts until you got used to it? <br> not liking those perfect shota thighs </br></br>  <br>You don't wanna go there man, you're inciting shotalust</br>  <br> the royal guards were hyped to hell and then shat on <br>How were they shat on? They always had the advantage over the hunters, except Pitou because of Komugi.</br></br>  <br> It didn't sacrifice anything you fucking moron. You haven't come up with one good point about why it's bad writing except that you didn't like it. <br>I have, but you take on one point and ignore the rest in your cowardice. <br> thematic depth (that is not childish by battle shounen standards) <br> that is not childish by childish standards <br>You're really reaching here. The fact that he sacrificed the meat of shonen, which the powerlevel shit and fighting, for his idiotic platitudes is a waste of time and, frankly, bad writing. <br>  while still obeying the in universe rules is bad writing at all. <br>Only in the most literal, technical ways. Again, he never properly defined those rules, some of which felt poorly written as they were.<br>You're pretty simple tbh<br><br><br> So yeah, unexpected. Would you have prefered an in-depth explanation of how nukes work before the fight? <br>Wasn't remotely implied by my post. The fact is that it's lazy to end it that way, and you damn well know it. Maybe not the original nuke, but the fallout? Don't be absurd.<br> Not at all, did you really not think to yourself "why don't they just nuke them?" <br>Exactly what came in to my head- why not nuke them (which is more potent than some mystical inter dimensional power apparently), spread the fallout conveniently, and stretch nen rules to their limits in order to have everything prepared in time to meet my deadlines and play dragon quest.<br><br> Alluka didn't "restore everything". <br>You really think Gon won't get his potential back one way or another?<br><br>Established:set up (an organization, system, or set of rules) on a firm or permanent basis.<br><br>There was no mention of these causality defying potential abilities, no mention of any sort of ability available without training, Killua had to train for months to reach a fraction of gon's power. Again, a shonen cliche: want it it's yours.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think we got what we needed from the guards, youpi was impenetrable and pufu was master faggotron. Pitou could've used a proper fight before being fisted, though.</br>  <br>Because if it wasn't it would have gone very different. Nevermind how Netero managed to get a 100kg bomb at the least implanted into his body on short notice and then fight someone like meruem</br>  <br>No, because I immediately understood that was the entire point. Hype up these exceptionally strong beings that have every advantage over mankind, and beat them in the most obvious yet unexpected way because humans are fucked up. I don't require climactic battles to enjoy a series, the whole idea of mankind's evolution/malice was interesting enough for me.</br>  <br> Why does Youpi resemble a human? <br>better question: Why does Youpi resemble Phinks?</br></br>  <br>I sincerely apologize, I didn't know what I was getting myself into<br><br><br>Dear god<br><br><br>Probably put it in his stomach or used nen trickery</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So you think the nuke was a handicap of sorts for Netero's performance?</br>  <br>Come to think of it youpi is a magical beast, right? Why did radiation poisoning affect him?</br>  <br>Pretty much, you just summed what makes CA so good.</br>  <br> The fact that he sacrificed the meat of shonen, which the powerlevel shit and fighting,  <br>All this time I've been arguing with someone who thinks generic shounen fare is a good thing. What a waste of time goddamn, there's plenty of Naruto out there for you to enjoy instead anon.</br></br>  <br>He wasn't magical enough</br>  <br> The fact that he sacrificed the meat of shonen <br>Why are you speaking like shounen is a genre?</br></br>  <br> All this time I've been arguing with someone who thinks generic shounen fare is a good thing <br>You mean like the generic themes of the Chimera Ant Arc? topkek<br> What a waste of time goddamn <br>It really took you a sizable amount of time to ad hom and run away?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Unless you use the "fuck you its magic" defence there is no way you can fit a nuke into a body, they are just too big. Even miniaturized ones are like 5 feet long, right?</br></br>  <br>its not, its a way of life.</br>  <br> magical beasts can't be affected by radiation poisoning <br>This is what you're saying</br></br>  <br>What would you call shounen then? A category of artistic composition, as in music or literature, characterized by similarities in form, style, or subject matter? That seems to fit</br>  <br>Because they're still biological creatures, not ethereal fairies</br>  <br>Google the definition of shounen then you'll see</br>  <br>I honestly know nothing about nukes. Apparent the HxH universe made a really small one. The explosion wasn't supposed to be a super large one to destroy a city though. SUre looked ike it could have though.</br>  <br>Radiation only affects organics<br><br>Youpi isn't in the animal kingdom<br><br>Why would it?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Radiation only affects organics <br>So Magical Beasts aren't organics now?</br></br>  <br>Because they magically obtained all the powers of organics except the cockroaches and various regenerative organism lel</br>  <br>What's the difference between magical beasts and animals then? Aesthetics?</br>  <br> magical beasts <br> beasts <br><br>what would you call them then? They still have cells. It's not specified what makes them magical, other than hailing from the dark continent or something that I just pulled out from my asshole</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tech is a bit off in HxH, not quite realistic but not totally ridiculous either. Like blimps, computers you can slide a card into, bug shaped phones, etc. It's pretty easy to accept that they have small nukes.</br>  <br>Demographic your mule, it's not a genre, fighting it's not necessarily the meat of a shounen, you can have a shounen without even a single fight.</br>  <br>Are they? What's the point in calling them "magical" beasts if they're carbon based lifeforms like literally every other living thing?</br>  <br>Because they might have come from the Dark Continent</br>  <br>That they have different traits than normal ones, Idk. it's never explained. basically things that are fuckin weird like that strawberry dinosaur or a centaur.</br>  <br>if they have unexplained supernatural power, probably.<br>I don't understand why Chimera Ants as a whole would be considered magical beasts though, they don't really have powers.</br></br>  <br>My guess is just that anything that came from the dark continent is considered a magical beast, but that may be wrong.<br><br>Also, here's Hisoka https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VAZ<wbr>uMuconQc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  When is the anime coming back?    <br> The fact is that it's lazy to end it that way, and you damn well know it. <br>I don't really see how it was lazy, if Togashi wanted to be lazy he could have gotten them all killed in different ways. Potclean could have reached Yupi's limit, Morel could have defeated Pouf.<br> why not nuke them (which is more potent than some mystical inter dimensional power apparently) <br>Well yes, the powerlevels are relatively low compared to other shounen. Gon's jajanken "only" has as much power as a cannon according to the dodgeball game and it's still a powerful ability.<br> spread the fallout conveniently <br>Conveniently? They went into the nuke's crater and stayed in there for a good while. It's really not something incredible.<br> and stretch nen rules to their limits <br>Yeah, being pushed to their limits doesn't count as breaking the rules. I don't see your point at all.<br> You really think Gon won't get his potential back one way or another? <br>At this point it's speculation, there's no point in discussing this. There's nothing to make us think that Gon is going to get his powers back or that he even wants them back.<br><br> There was no mention of these causality defying potential abilities <br>Enhancers were stated to be able to improve their natural abilities in Heaven's Arena, Gon was stated to have a 1 in 10 millions potential in nen in the same arc and the covenant system was established in Yorkshin.<br> no mention of any sort of ability available without training <br>The point of covenants is to duplicate your power without training, see Kurapika. Not to mention Gon trained as much as Killua and still was slightly weaker until Gon-san.<br> Again, a shonen cliche: want it it's yours. <br>He wanted to win against Knuckle, but he lost. What did he want in this case? Redemption? Because he didn't get it either.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Did they ever explain this shit? Apparently there's a sacred symbol that boosts nen? I mean like they could add onto this shit so much.<br>It's a big plot hole imo. This could have something to do with the origins of nen or some shit.</br>  <br>See if they had said it was an expensive prototype or something fine, but it was written as something they just picked out of the garage.</br>  <br>LOL</br>  <br> Netero managed to get a 100kg bomb at the least implanted into his body on short notice <br>Wasn't it stated to be a shitty small third world nuke? Also he was gone for like a month</br></br>  <br>What difference does it make? A cheap small nuke isn't much less realistic than an expensive small nuke. Neither exist in real life and they don't have to, it's a fantasy setting in the end. The results were in line with cheapness in the end, it wasn't a huge explosion.</br>  <br>I think it was an idea Togashi scrapped. Like the nen symbols on Wing's promise thread and Ging's box thing.</br>  <br>unlimited shonen power ups, here we go!</br>  <br>Oh yeah I totally forgot about those too.<br><br>Assuming he didn't scrap it. He needs to explain that shit deeply. You can't just create a fucking sacred symbol of nen and not explain it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>not scrapped. it was on the back of Killua's head during the CA arc. also, Chrollos book has the symbol.</br></br>  <br> it was on the back of Killua's head during the CA arc <br>Wait, what? No it wasn't.<br><br>Also, What about the symbol on Chrollos forehead?</br></br></br></br>  <br> it was on the back of Killua's head during the CA arc <br>What?</br></br>  <br> Chrollos book has the symbol. <br>No it doesn't. It's just a book with some text and a handprint</br></br>  <br>why don't I remember this</br>  How can I if we don't have mr. jew-fu anymore?  <br><br>Because a nuke that small would be very very valuable and expensive. I think the Davey crocket artillery nuke is the smallest nuclear device fielded, and just the warhead is the size of a 1st grader<br><br>But let's say it was really small, say the size of a watermellon. Did Netero lube up and shove it up his ass?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're asking for the source? It's was during that boxing match on greed island</br>  <br>;_;7</br>  <br>It was in the boxing match that was part of the pirates and razor (Ging's criminal volleyball friend) during the Greed Island arc. Apparently it allowed the boxer to teleport his fist, although that doesn't explain why Leorio could do something similar easily</br>  <br>You must have missed the part where Netero learned to stretch his asshole as wide as he wanted, having practiced it for 30 years in the wilderness</br>  <br><br><br>On Chrollos book when he used it on Zeno/Silva, on the back of Killuas head when he used Narukami on Youpi.</br></br></br>  <br> Because a nuke that small would be very very valuable and expensive. <br>Didn't the narrator say it could be mass-produced? It'd explain why it was considered cheap.<br> Did Netero lube up and shove it up his ass? <br>He had 2 huge scars on his abdomen, i think his asshole wasn't flexible enough.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dude could stop the bleeding in his leg just with his muscles. He's probably got an unbelievable level of sphincter control as well.</br>  <br>No...Just no....</br>  <br>Do you mind posting those panels? I really don't remember that.</br>  <br>when did it show his abdomen?</br>   morel introduced <br> big guy talking shit to killua, watch him get rekt <br><br> later that arc <br> turns out to be absolutely based <br><br>Morel best bro</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Didn't the narrator say it could be mass-produced? It'd explain why it was considered cheap. <br><br>Yes, I'm just saying for a setting that seems to be nearly the same technology wise, something like mass produced super-miniaturized nukes is a little too futuristic.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I think his ability is the most versatile one we've seen with Hisoka's, i hope he's not dying on the DC.</br></br></br>  <br><br>anime version is more clear</br></br>  <br> Knov introduced <br> slightly cooler than Morel but still a dick, seems like he's the more level headed one <br> ends up wimping out just from seeing Pouf's aura, when Gon and Killua got to see Pitou up close and weren't nearly that traumatized </br></br></br>  <br>Oh yea, I definitely see it.</br>  <br>They have zeppelins as the standard means of air travel. They can deviate a little when it comes to technology.</br>  <br>That's because Knov was using Zetsu, anon.<br><br>His younger brother Wing explained to Gon and Killua that being exposed to nen without using it themselves would be like walking through a blizzard naked</br></br></br>  Better than Morel and equipped with a much more interesting ability. But what happens?<br><br>Also, Are Knov, Morel, Killua, Knuckle, Shoot and Gon now Triple Star Hunters for exterminating the Chimera Ants?</br></br>  <br>So? Zeppelins are nearly a century old. This isn't steampunk or anything either. It'd be like having p-51s tearing up titans in snk.</br>  <br>I didn't see neither Gon nor Killua going bald from facing Hisoka in Heaven's Arena though.</br>  <br><br>Ah, thanks I forgot about that part. I just started and finished the HxH anime a few days like a week ago, I remember focusing too much on his shriveled body to notice the scar.<br><br><br>Wait, when did it say they were related?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because Hisoka is weak as fuck and probably didn't want to scare Gon and Killua so he kept his aura to a bare minimum</br>  <br>Well to be fair, Knov was in Zetsu and Pouf's aura was full dark thoughts because of what happened with Komugi. Knov also thought it was Pitou's aura, and Pitou's aura wasn't "evil" like Pouf, more like amoral. It literally was just a curious animal.<br><br>Hisoka wasn't trying to break them.</br></br></br>  <br>I think Morau was in talks of becoming a triple star</br>  <br>If any stars, I'd say just 1. Maybe 2 at the most. I think they'd have to do a little more to get 3 stars. Also, they get stars for a specific field, and I'm not sure if killing enemies is a field unless you're an assassin or whatever, maybe big game hunter? Except Morel is a Sea Hunter, so why would he get a star for a different hunting field?</br>  <br>I think Morel did get an extra star, i don't know about the rest though.</br>  <br> hisoka is weak  <br><br>Did you forget him killing based butler man?</br></br></br>  <br>I will never forgive him for that<br><br>I still like Hisoka though he's pretty fucked up</br></br></br>  <br>The fact that old technology is being used is just another example of technology deviating from the real world, just in the opposite direction, since you'd think they'd use planes. You have to assume that logic doesn't apply.</br>  <br><br><br>If I'm not mistaken, 3 Stars is rewarded for SUBSTANTIAL achievements on a global scale. Now I don't know what Cheadle and Pariston did to get 3 Stars, but Im pretty sure eliminating the greatest threat to humanity in HxH history should award 3 Stars.</br></br></br>  <br> Wait, when did it say they were related? <br>I'm just pulling shit from my ass. It would be cool if they were though.</br></br>  <br> Did you forget him killing based butler man? <br> implying Gotoh was strong <br><br>Congrats, he killed someone who used easily counterable coins . He only killed him because Illumi told him to.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then it should be consistent...it can be logical sometimes as with the radiation poisoning, but then when the plot needs it the logic is turned off</br>  <br>Yeah, technology isn't really linear in fantasy settings. They did talk about fighter jets at some point too.</br>  <br>That's not how stars work.<br><br> Hunters who achieve extraordinary accomplishments in a certain field will receive a star. <br> Veteran Hunters who have received a star, become superior officers, and have had their students receive a star will receive two stars. <br> Hunters with two stars who achieve extraordinary accomplishments in multiple fields will receive three stars. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His coins packed more power than bullets, and he was insanely accurate with them. If hisoka didn't prep for it with an exit strategy beforehand he'd be dead when he was trapped in his own gum, remember?</br>  <br>Wait, that means Shoot and Knuckle did get a star then. I mean they were both UMA and beast hunters respectively, so it makes sense.</br>  <br> His coins packed more power than bullets <br>Mainly because he added nen to it, but that's REALLY not impressive in the hxh universe</br></br>  <br> implying the Zoldycks would hire weaklings to take care of their family </br>  <br>Well compared to Gotoh , Hisoka was stronger .<br>But they're both virtually weak</br></br>  <br>I don't know, Uvo got hurt by a sniper rifle. Guns can do damage in HxH.</br>  Continue, now with 80% less lewd to please the Janny.  In other news the Prisma Illya fanbase managed to outcancer both the normal Fate threads and the Naruto threads at once.<br><br>Impressive.</br></br>  <br>I'd like to think that 95% of /a/ is part of the Prisma Illya fanbase. But 30% is in denial and must shitpost to feel better about their innermost feelings.</br>  <br> outcancer  <br> fucking Naruto  <br> Zerofaggets  <br>Not possible</br></br></br></br>  <br>No it didn't, retard.</br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128505999 <br>Hi Rednigger.</br>  Disappointing that we didn't get a three way.

How do I encourage myself to draw more? My usual methods don't seem to be working.   Prim and proper in public, but a sub-human beast in bed who screams hard and bites her lover's shoulders whenever she is fucking him. And she loves raw anal. <br>Draw both sides of Ikaruga, perhaps the former mainly in a sexual act, suggestive, or completely SFW.</br>  <br>I know.</br>  <br>But tomorrow is today</br>  These requests make me just want to draw my own drawings instead.  <br>Believe in yourself, that's the place to start.</br>   <br><br>Was busy most of today.

He only loses to plot-convenience, asspull shield of fairy magic and "Ea is too good for you".  <br>I think all of the people back in Uruk were low-key mages since Alaya was more concentrated then ever before. They were compared to low tier gods.</br>    <br>Oh boy this part.</br>    <br>They are all Heroic Spirits though, it's just that they're nothing compared to real Servants.<br>He's right, they wouldn't be as easy to kill as a normal army, but nor would each individual one be a real threat to Cu. You're both forgetting that Cu has an anti-army noble phantasm on hand, so even if he can't just charge in and kill them all hand-to-hand, he can still wipe them off the face of the earth with precision the likes of which you've never seen before, faggot.<br>It's either that, or keep running and avoid conflict with the army while in the RM, or just hit Iskander with GB anyway for the insta-kill.<br>Cu has so many ways of hardcountering Zero-Rider it's ridiculous.</br></br></br></br>  New episode later thread.<br><br>Hamilton a cute.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Not Romans being met with a literal tidal-wave and survivors are stung by jellyfish and gnawed at by deep-sea monstrosities that eventually explode due to the massive difference in pressure. <br><br>It would be kind of hilarious to me, but yes quite horrifying. <br><br>Now imagine the GATE opening up on the moon. <br><br>BAM, suddenly the vacuum of space begins pulling everything through.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is there a person who read "web version"?<br>GATE was first written in internet site called Arcadia at 2006, which is the year writer Takumi Yanai finished his service in JGSDF.<br>sorry for my bad english</br></br>  <br>Ok but are you sure Persia is the one who clawed him?
