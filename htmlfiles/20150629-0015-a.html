[  Shirou is 167cm <br> Gilgamesh is 182cm <br>Manlets, when will they learn?</br></br>  Why are his legs so long and his torso so short?  Why are his feet so puffy? Does he suffer from diabetes? I'm worried about his health.<br><br>Why are his forearms so short? Is this a birth defect?</br></br>  So, what is this ninja doing here?  Slutting it up.  <br>Being perfect.<br> It's a passive ability that she can't suppress, so don't bother her about it. </br></br>  summoning dicks  <br>For what purpose?</br>  shes sending me a pic  <br>She's doing  ninja  things.</br>  Doffy Nico for your heart!  Anyone else want God Usopp's bounty to go up by an unprecedented amount? Maybe from $30 million to $300 million? It might happening when hundreds of former pirates and other ne'er-do-wells leave Dressorsa spreading word of how Usopp broke the Hobby curse and how they revere him as a messiah.<br><br>Not to mention having Usopp's bounty the 2nd highest in the crew is like poetry.</br></br>  <br>Usopp is the best crewmember, so yes</br>  <br>He lost so quickly it's unreasonable or should I say unbelievable. When I was reading the chapter there was no sense of "OMFG!" it was just an "eh? Oh Doffy's lost oh well" I'm not even hype for the future arcs after this bullshit. This really is a poor man's alabasta arc.<br><br>I wish Oda stopped dickriding the chapters. had he just fused the final chapters together it wouldn't have been so bad. Oda's losing his fucking edge.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, 100m is the most likely. I think Usopp might be getting Luffy's previous bounties. Completely baseless, yea, but hey.</br>  Aokiji was haki stabbed by Shirohige, Akainu was haki sliced by Marco and Vista, Crocodile was (haki?) decapitated by Doflamingo.<br>How come they survived that? Can haki users with logia powers block haki attacks or something?</br>  <br>They changed shape so the attack didn't hit them. Crocodile was clearly not Haki decapitated. Aokiji literally does this like the next page after he gets stabbed.</br>  What powers will kaido have?<br><br>I'm betting on one of the following<br><br> Typhon Mystical Zoan <br> Hydra Mystical Zoan <br> Sabre tooth tiger Zoan <br> Blood Logia </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A plain ol' Lion Zoan. King of the Beasts, motherfucker. Enies Lobby 2.0 with Chopper Rescue Plot incoming.</br>  <br>Quickly? Lmfao.<br><br>I was honestly getting bored with this prolonged arc. A one on one fight should in my opinion not take several weeks.<br><br>Not that realism and manga go hand in hand, but a one on one fight where both opponents are like fucking gods and it just never ends are really boring.<br><br>I think the reason series like Naruto and Bleach always turn to shit in the end is just that. The ridiculous power ups they always get. Shit becomes really boring when that last drop of realism gets thrown out the window.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But then why don't they do that all the time when they get injured? Aokiji lost a leg for fuck's sake.<br><br>If they can just change shape to evade the haki attack, then what's the point of haki attacks? They were brought up especially so that a normal human being could defeat logia users.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably because they can't ? They fought for 10 fucking days, dude. Both of them were heavily injured. You think Aokiji is going to be on tip top shape on Day 9th when Akainu was throwing a fucking Magma rock at him ? Hell no. The point of Haki is not literally ''can hit Logia I guess lel''</br>  <br>God Mystical Zoan. Or devil.<br><br>Probably not, it will be some generic albeit strong animal. But I want Oda to go all out here.</br></br></br>  <br> The point of Haki is not literally ''can hit Logia I guess lel'' <br>That was literally what it was brought up for in the first place though. And anyway, the fact remains that a haki user can hit logia users, and that rule simply did not seem to apply when Aokiji got stabbed.</br></br>  If Doflamingo could make clones of himself, why didn't he get more outlandish and just copied himself exactly to the detail? Why not go full Bayonetta and create some weird string beasts?  <br>Because Aokiji didn't get hit. It's that simple. The attack simply didn't hit him. You could say he just dodged. It's not that hard to understand. And iirc, CoA was first used to hit Luffy, a paramecia.</br>  Does anyone know what kind of island Zou is? Sounds like it would be related to wano/Kano  <br>Haki showed up in the literal first chapter.</br>  <br>Probably because it would be very weird. And Doffy could probably only make some Flamingo's which would have made Luffy lose his shit.</br>  <br>Hmm, in that case I find it weird that Aokiji looked so shocked when being stabbed.<br>Also, Rayleigh could stop Kizaru with a strike of his sword, wouldn't Kizaru possibly be able to dodge it the same way?<br>Then again he did not get hurt by that. Also, Marco sent him flying with a kick, so Kizaru probably just isn't that good at dodging things? Or does not care because he is Kizaru.<br><br> CoA was first used to hit Luffy, a paramecia. <br>Same difference. It circumvented a devil fruit power to hit the user.<br><br><br>But it was not adressed by name and described expositionally.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People speculate that it is the Korea to Kano's Japan.</br>  <br>King of Beasts fruit.</br>  <br>Big Dick 90inch Mystical Zoan, I'm calling it right now.</br>  <br>Remember when people thought Akainu had blood logia? good times</br>  <br>Black person zoan. Luffy will have to play basketball against him for the title of Yonko. When Kaido reveals his awakened zoan he turns into Shaqaido o'Neal and is like 20 feet tall. To keep up, Luffy will perform a full body gear 3, and also get back his afro power from the Foxy boxing fight.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1Pl<wbr>wOe6WKz4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Aokiji just looks serious. Not shocked whatsoever. Kizaru is a lazy shit and you know it. And there's nothing to say Kizaru has the same mastery over his fruit that Aokiji and Akainu has. And Rayleigh kept up with a fucking Light dude. That could be also a clue. <br><br>And it still hits Devil Fruit users. You just have to not be a scrub. Which Luffy won't be when he fights Akainu.</br></br></br></br></br>  quote me on this one<br><br>its going to be a monkey zoan</br></br>  <br>Mythical King Kong Zoan who gets taken out by Luffy's Gear 5 "King Kong Jet Pistole Pasta Machine"</br>  <br>I can see this happening in Gintama very soon.</br>  <br>I think he looked shocked, but fair point. It just seems like a minor inconsistency to me, but I can write it off as "haki raises your chances against logia types" rather than seeing as like "haki always beats logia".<br><br> And there's nothing to say Kizaru has the same mastery over his fruit that Aokiji and Akainu has. <br>Well, he's been a marine for the same amount of time and was known as a "monster" back then aswell. So I just jumped to that conclusion.<br><br>Also, I find it kinda sad that we probably won't ever have a marine as strong as the red-yellow-blue admirals with Shengoku on top. Fujitora apparently is much weaker than the other admirals (though obviously he has still time to prove himself) and I don't have really high hopes for green bull (will he maybe be a zoan user? we don't really have any zoan marines other than The Buddha).<br>It feels like Luffy will never defeat the marines at the zenit of their power, even if he beats Akainu at the end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Everyone remember to do you best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br>We don't even know if they both had fruits back then. And if we're going by the movie info, Zephyr says that Kizaru relies on his fruit too much so we can assume that he is a cocky prick that won't think about dodging that much. And Rokugyu and Fujitora has been called ''Monsters'' too.</br>  <br>But Fujitora seems so much weaker than the previous admirals. It would seem unreasonable that the marines could simply replace their strongest forces that were intact for the decades without a drop in power - though obviously possible.</br>  <br>Ayy</br>  Damn, I keep forgetting how few logia users there actually are. Seems like so many more because Smoker was introduced early, but many that seem to be logias from memory are just logiaesk paramecias, like Mr. 3, Jozu or Magellan.<br>It feels like thee are more characters that have conqueror's haki than logia powers (though that obviously is not true.)</br>  <br>An actual high bounty's capabilities horrified Usopp. He's not there yet.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=egJ<wbr>_tcZC0Ek</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br>I wouldn't bet against Oda just yet, we've seen the extend of the Marines but not of the World Government. <br><br>We know for sure a new generation of Pacifista is coming, no clue what Vegapunk is up to, CP0 has been on the sidelines.

He's a great fighter we think doesn't have a fruit because he's ashamed of it.

People who have eaten a Devil Fruit are "hated" by the sea, and cannot swim. The "sea" here can refer to anything from rivers, pools and baths to any kind of standing water. On a worldwide level, they are all the "sea." When these people enter the water, not only can they not use their powers, they have trouble moving their bodies at all. They might be able to struggle a bit, but it wouldn't do much good. That's if their entire bodies are submerged in the "sea." With less than half the body or just the limbs, it gets easier. Also, rain and dripping water have no effect at all. Therefore, hip baths or showers are the most common choice. Now, in Crocodile's case, "water" is the weakness of his very powers, so his abilities are robbed even in the shower. But it's not like there are enemies around when you take a shower, so I'd bet he would take them even with his powers being blocked. Don't you think? ---And to answer your final question, about myself bathing. As it happens, I do bathe. Twice! In a year! </br></br></br>  <br>You could easily rape crocodile while he's taking a shower</br>  <br>So let me get this straight. So if you want your kid to be strong, determined, and successful, all you have to do is make his middle initial D? Why isn't everyone a D then?</br>  <br>it is not the name, it is the bloodline</br>  <br>Because not everyone believes in that superstition.</br>  &lt;- who knew?  <br>If I ever have a kid his middle name will be D</br>  <br> opmemes.com </br>  <br> Shotamingo has an adorable girl voice <br><br>Nice<br>Now why couldn't they do that with Law?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kaidou is Kaku with his awakened Giraffe Zoan, which turns him into a Kirin. <br><br>On a more serious note, I'm expecting one of the following<br><br> Mystical/Ancient Zoan <br> Godzilla Zoan <br> Lion Zoan <br> Something that seems dumb like a Flea Zoan or a Tardigrade Zoan that is actually retardedly powerful <br> Paramecia that lets him summon animals rather than become them <br> Something that lets him turn into any animal and mix and match them (Something like Ultimate Kars) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Griffin Zoan</br>  <br>You're not serious right?

When two conquerors haki user clash the only lasting affect is shockwaves and I'll list the examples:<br><br>Whitebeard vs Shanks = split the sky<br>Luffy vs Chinjao = shockwaves push people out of the coliseum<br>Luffy vs Doffy = shockwaves pushes Laws body away from danger</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This so much.</br></br>  <br>If i had to choose one of the two shotas to pat on the head and tell everything will be alright<br><br>I'd choose law</br></br></br>  After Kaidou is defeated, how much of the series would be left.  <br> Expecting realism in shonen </br>  <br>To be fair I'm pretty sure this is meant to be from Law's perspective (looking up at the building from the trash heap) but yeah the arms look weird.<br><br>Also:<br> yesterday Luffy's VA uploaded a photo to her blog with Usopp and Bellamy's VAs plus a random Yamadera Kouichi and vaguely said she met him at a "strange place" <br><br>What the fuck, is Corazon going to be Spike?<br>I can't read all the moon accompanying the picture.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so does chopper</br>  <br> One Piece seiyuu comment board with the multicolored magnets on the table <br><br>Confirmed</br></br></br>  <br>depends how far away kaidou is; oda confirmed time skip was halfway point so just multiply chapters times two and you have a rough estimate of chapters left</br>  <br>I honestly can't imagine that<br><br>There is so much fucking lore and subplots that hasn't even begun to be explained yet and the coming islands of Zou, Wano and probably Elbaf don't look like they'll answer any of them<br><br>Navy Admirals<br>Big Mom<br>Kaido<br>Blackbeard<br>Revolutionary Army<br>The big black ball that swallowed up Capone<br>Captain Kidd<br>X Drake<br>Whatever the fuck Kuzan's is doing<br>Whatever the fuck CP9 is going<br>Whatever the fuck CP0 and the WG are doing<br>The Gorosei<br>Rio Poneglyph<br>Joy Boy<br>All Blue<br>Mihawk<br>Actually finding the fucking one piece<br>Buggy<br>D. vs World Government<br>100 Year Void<br>Eneru and whatever it is he found in space<br>Vegapunk and whatever his deal is<br>The next Reverie<br>The third Superweapon<br>The Superweapons significance at all<br>Awakenings<br><br>Feel free to add</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn she old<br><br>Well I guess it's to be expected, she's been voicing Luffy for, what is it, 16 years?</br></br></br>  <br>The promise Noah was built for<br><br>Also the war Whitebeard said will result from finding One Piece.</br></br></br>  <br>yea i feel you, but imagine how fast these things were thrown on us, im sure a lot of the stuff is connected and will end up getting revealed/explained at the same time</br>  <br> she's 60 <br> average Japanese female life expectancy is 87 <br><br>Is she gonna finish One Piece? She probably won't wanna voice Luffy on her deathbed</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tanaka and Masako Nozawa are voice immortals</br>  <br>They're among friends, and since so many of them are old, I bet they've known each other for decades, so it's probably enjoyable.</br>  <br>He has said he was halfway done since 2007, I wouldn't trust his time estimates, we might still have twenty years to go.</br>  <br>Coby was introduced in the second chapter, and Oda's been progressing him along ever since, he's going to play a huge role eventually, but we still have no idea what could happen with his development.</br>  What kind of animal on Rokushiki island needed to get hit by this fucking attack in order for it to be killed?  <br>Wouldn't be hilarious if the creature was just a baby of it's kind?</br>  <br>*Rusukaina Meant to put that</br>  Are you ready?  <br>prove it</br>  <br> implying Kaidou isnt a giant tiger/Nue </br>  <br>Because Oda already had trouble defeating him the way he was. If he would have acted logically then he would have been forced to bring in even more help. As it stands, Luffy needs handholding from an entire island to beat a Doflamingo who was suffering from speed AIDS.<br><br>If he had exploited the puppets, like using them to go after innocent people etc then how should Luffy have beated than one? He didnt even manage to beat this version of him without people literally shielding him with their lives.</br></br></br>  <br>Godzilla maybe.</br>  <br><br>Because he could not do any of that shit, is this really hard for some people around here or something? Doffy did what he could and fought with the best he had, the rest is mere fanfiction.</br></br>  <br>Vergo and Sanji got the same sparks as Garp vs Chinjao, and Vergo didn't even use CoA, a proper CoC clash seems to be defined by the range of the thunder like effect.</br>  <br>Yeah, the CoC clash sparks were noticably longer and thinner and coloured more dark.</br>  /r/ing the image comparing naruto, bleach, and one piece across the years    <br>love how the fist homing in to hit its target is now canon</br>  <br> Shota Doffy has a cute voice but is a psychotic murderer <br> Shota Law has a 40 year old Kamiyan voice but is a blushing tsundere <br><br>Gotta go with the one least likely to decapitate me</br></br></br></br>  <br>Could he open the gate of Babylon?</br>  <br>what a wasted fruit</br>  <br>I wonder how Ohtani and the others feel about their several year long vacations.</br>  Toei will rape this scene<br><br>We can only hope they allocate their one good animator to the scene</br></br>  <br> Funimation makes Doffy Canadian </br>  <br> I wonder how Ohtani and the others feel about their several year long vacations. <br>Zoro and Chopper were actually in Kekkai Sensen though I think the latter was only a small part, and she's still Pikachu. I know Sanji and Brook still get work, Cho was in Jojo.<br><br>I have not seen Nami in absolutely fucking anything other than One Piece since Noein.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Noein <br>Wasn't that over a decade ago?</br></br>  <br>Yes. Actually I just remembered her in FMA:B and Kuragehime too.<br><br> I don't watch much. </br></br></br>  <br>they voice characters for other shows, i.e. sanji in keksen, zoro in gintama etc.</br>  <br>I'm sorry, I just meant from One Piece, the cast as a whole seem so close, I was just wondering whether they feel annoyed that they won't be doing anything with them for years.</br>  The episode today was trash. Even the Luffy vs Doffy bits seemed cool at first but after watching them the animation is absolutely atrocious. Toe step up your fucking game.  <br> I'm sorry, I just meant from One Piece, the cast as a whole seem so close <br>I dunno bro<br><br>I'm pretty sure they hang out outside of the recording studio sometimes?</br></br></br></br>  Oda needs to hurry up and write someone with a mind control or hypnosis fruit to satisfy my sexual fetishes. It's his responsibility.  <br>There's a picture of a whole bunch of VA's and their favourite roles and the roles they got famous for are listed next to them. Takai's famous role is Zoro, but his favourite is Hijikata from Gintama, likewise with all the other Gintama seiyuus, apparently they hang out as friends as well, so you never know.</br>  Sorry if this is a silly question, but why did it matter to Law that Doffy used lead bullets?  <br>Because of the amber lead that poisoned Law's homeland and himself, it's just more insulting.</br>    <br>I see. I thought there was some sort of other underlying meaning I missed.<br><br>Thank you, anon!</br></br></br>  <br>Dude</br>  <br>The number of doujins and fanfictions that came out from this episode.........................</br>  <br> ......................... </br>  <br>Even though that would be the best solution, either they will be given a boat or Kanjuro will draw them a crappy one.</br>  <br>i like luffyko in laws crew doujins.</br>  <br> Kanjuro will draw them a crappy one <br><br>Holy hell I want this to happen like even just an attempt. Just to see Law's/Zoro's/Usopp's reactions!</br></br></br>  <br> Kanjuro will draw them a crappy one. <br><br>Setting aside that DF powers won't even work in water, how long do you suppose a paper boat will last on the sea before they all drown?</br></br></br>  <br> happy rocinante <br><br>Rocinante wouldn't be happy , he wanted to stop doffy because that was his duty as brother , but finally he didn't shoot because he loves his brother.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, is it still paper ?

And I think there are still some ships left unharmed? <br><br>How far is Zou and will they need a navigator to get there? Did Doffy include "navigation" in the stuff that Law had to learn as a kid because that's just awesome... I kind of want Cavendish to have some navigation skills. Not sure why.</br></br></br>  <br> He ate the Zilla Zilla no Mi </br>  <br>Nah it's the Toka Toka No Mi Model: Gojira.</br>  <br>Nah, they'd be besties.</br>  <br>I'd love that.<br><br> Ships in the Docks are all wrecked beyond any sailing capacity of their own <br> Leave this to me you guys!

I mean, he obviously knows about popular shit like luna and zosan, but does he know that there's people out there writing doflacora and robin/chopper porn? Does he know that there are drawings of garp fucking ace?  <br>What code? It's just a reference to an American soldier's identification tags that ends with USA and murrikafat.</br>  <br> robin/chopper porn <br> garp fucking ace <br><br>I was not prepared for this knowledge</br></br></br></br>  Qucik! Find a piece that foreshadows Law as next crew  <br>but RobinxChopper is so obvious tho</br>  <br>People will ship anything with everything. It's to be expected. Why would he care?

Rin got DP JACKHAMMER by both Shirou and Red man  So in the end shirou becomes red man??  Did they kiss in the VN? I can't remember.  <br>Kissed AND Fucked</br>  <br>caster route when ?</br>  They canon fucked. Chill.  <br>I know they fucked, can't remember any kissing.</br>  So no anime original Shirou X Rin in the last episode, then? Is the arm hug to tease Issei and London proposal all we get?<br><br>Fuck, I was hoping they'd at least give us a kiss.</br></br>  Just to clarify, Shirou basically goes the way of Archer right?<br><br>It's his fate to always turn into Archer?</br></br>  <br>4th row down. Rin is the only heroine that actually kisses Shirou.</br>  <br>Rin and Shirou should've tag teamed Luvia, like in the True Ending.</br>  <br>There was tons of snime original Rin and Shirou stuff. Watch it.</br>  <br>READ THE FUCKING VN OR WAIT FOR THE BD</br>  <br><br>He's walking the same road as Archer, but is pretty much all but explicitly stated to surpass him in results.</br></br>  <br>No, he surpassed Archer.</br>  <br>Watch the episode.</br>  <br><br>What does that mean exactly?<br><br>Does he still end up traveling through time as a soldier and die at the end?<br><br>Does he stick with Rin forever?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> read the VN <br>Sick meme.</br></br>  <br>Shirou got the majority of Archer's skills while still being young and fell in love with a girl who will always support him in every way possible. He's obviously going to get both more powerful than pre-guardian Archer via honing his skills and probably much luckier in life.</br>  <br>Why does no one have the Saber version</br>  <br>No, he likely never makes a contract to become a Guardian. He'll travel the world heroing it up with Rin by his side most of the time.</br>  Why does /a/ unanimously gets mad when a couple doesn't kiss?<br><br>It's like love depends on kisses, what the fuck.</br></br>  <br>Ah I get it now. That's a pretty good way to live.<br><br>Thanks anon.</br></br></br>  <br>FUCKING<br>BASED<br>UFOTABLE</br></br></br>  <br>Kisses are super cute, lovely and intimate. <br><br>A pair that is not even using kisses and only holding hands (while having "sex" with dolphins on the same time) is weird as shit and simply stupid.<br><br>tl;dr <br>No kisses = shit tier relationships.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> only holding hands <br><br>Nigger that's some /d/-tier shit.</br></br></br>  <br>What about holding legs then?</br>  <br><br>What if they can't kiss?  ;_; </br></br>  <br>/a/ also doesn't process that a kiss could've possibly happened off-screen.

They might do stuff, or they might not. Kind of like how Shirou might train to use his Reality Marble.</br>  <br><br>how does projecting the scabbard allow him to see saber</br></br>  <br>He knows what lies ahead if you live a dream that big and the suffering. Knowing Shirou rather follow his heart would be better as he did the one thing he could not do himself.</br>  <br><br>You forgot the best route.<br><br> Carnival Phantasm. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I feel like we've had this same discussion like seven times today</br>  OH SHIT same person?<br><br>I'm a tertiary but this pleases me greatly.</br></br>  <br>Wait I think you are on to something here<br>But who was the red man?</br></br>  <br>Nah, Saber died under that tree.</br>  <br>The threads for HF are going to be even worse than UBW aren't they? In addition to the normal Fateshitposting crowd, there's also going to be all the autistic UBW fans pissed that HF might even by 1% better than UBW's adaptation.</br>  <br> hand holding before marriage  <br>This is degeneracy</br></br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>He follows his heart in both routes. The difference is that one decision destroy his heart and mind for momment when he drops the saving everyone (in exchange he gets the normal happy family ending), and in the other he decides to always follow his belief because he sees it as an extremly beutiful thing that he doesn't to let go (which makes him equally or more happy than his HF version at end).<br>I don't really know what will Kerry like more, but I like to think that the UBW answer is the best out of the three.</br></br>  <br>dragons go to avalon when they die.</br>  So why does Sakura kill Shinji in Realta Nua HF if he doesn't rape her? What does she cry about in the rain scene if she's still a virgin? What do the worms do if they don't fuck the shit out of her?  <br>They're going to be movies and BDs are going to take months to come out, so we'll probably not see as much shitposting if only because there'll be less threads</br>  <br>Saber wasn't a dragon.</br>  <br>They are movies, the shitposting will be lessen only because of that.</br>  <br>She is a dragonborn</br>  <br> 10 years later turns from wimpering fukboi to old man with nerves of iron <br>Yea.. no.<br><br><br>500 million people released to that pic</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>She sort of is</br>  <br>It's hard to kiss someone with a horn in the way</br>  <br> The threads for HF are going to be even worse than UBW aren't they? <br>Probably not. It will have less people from other sites since there is no anime airing. Its still the usual Sakura shitposting and there isn't as many plot holes in HF since Nasu tones down the servant thing in that route.</br></br>  <br><br> that is what passes for a 21st-century english girl in Japan </br></br>   People thinking there will be kissing in the BD <br><br>Gullible idiots</br></br>  <br> 10 years later turns from wimpering fukboi to old man with nerves of iron <br> implying it wasn't being the Master of best Rider that made him even more perfect </br></br>  <br>Sport bra are life <br>Sport bra are love</br></br>  <br>she's finnish.</br>  <br>Remember the 100 minutes of extra content?</br>  <br>She's a Finnish magician though</br>  Shirou is happiest in HF true.  <br>I think the recently announced drama CD is going to make up for any run time in the 2nd season BD's.</br>  <br>Its all because of this girl.</br>  <br>that girl also makes me happy</br>  <br>Saber never dies. She gets put on a small boat and leaves for Avalon.</br>  <br>LE is fanfiction bullshit to please the saberfags also it retcon the point of the fate route</br>  <br>he spoils a movie and she gets mad</br>  <br>At least she has a job.</br>  <br><br> Finnish <br><br>Doesn't make it any better.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Have you ever seen a Native Finn? She has to have Swedish Blood in there as well.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Avalon isn't actually that hard to get into.<br><br>Real life mythology-wise, Avalon is just but one part of the "Otherworld", various realms all connected with it each other by a common entity: faeries<br><br>Forgot which myth that stated this but one of the ways to get into Avalon involves some fucking apple tree or some shit like that and doing something with the seed or consuming it.<br><br>Perhaps, Shirou became a hardcore Celtic/Welshwhatever literature/mythological faggot and projected enough related shit as he goes Indiana Jones in Britain or Ireland where eventually he found some way to enter Avalon or traveled and lost himself in one fairy realm to another, until he finally entered the fairy realm he wanted: Avalon because funny enough, a lot of heroes end up accidentally wandering into the Otherworld without realizing it because fairies are big jokers like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  All these threads make me wanna pick up FSN and I gather that there multiple story universes, so what series should I watch/skip?  <br>Have you ever seen a Japanese person? <br>They don't look like Rin or Shirou let me tell you.</br></br>  <br>Then wouldn't she be asian?</br>  <br>someone need update that pic with issei, kuro,ciel,sella and the other prisma girls</br>  <br>Original Fate/stay night VN if you want the complete experience.</br>  <br>This is incorrect.</br>  <br><br> Luvia is in epilogue <br> Doesn't ohohohoh once <br><br>Worst fucking adaption ever. Fuck you, ufo table.</br></br></br></br></br>  does servants even has a chance against CG Archer?  Why does Luvia speak fluent Japanese if she is a Finnish girl living in Britain?  <br>Bazzet is the cutest</br>  <br>lewd</br>  <br>For the same reason Waver and Kayneth did.</br>  <br>Trilingual.</br>  <br>We got better than a kiss.<br><br><br>What's this?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why do all these Brits speak fluent Japanese? Why does London sound more like Tokyo then Islamabad?</br></br>  <br>same for servants</br>  <br>Why did Archer come back again?<br>I thought he died</br></br>  <br>Confirmation that Shirou and Rin screwed. Like, a lot.</br>  <br>Nope his puppet body is shit which can't manage mana correctly.</br>  <br>I know but what's that book for? UBWs script or something?</br>  <br>Neither did they()<br><br>BUT YOU DON'T SEE ME MAKING A FUCKINGTHREAD ABOUT IT.</br></br></br>  <br>Rin's VA's script, I think.</br>  <br>Yeah, I think it was Ueda's.</br>  <br>Kiss is for the sequel.</br>  <br>Tongues is a third-level spell, no big deal</br>  <br><br>That's cool.</br></br>  <br>Maybe fucking read what's typed next to it holy shit.</br>  <br>Yeah, what the fuck? Fucking Ufotable, they don't show anything of their cute relation.</br>  <br>His original body couldn't do it properly either, the puppet body is stated to be stronger than the original.</br>    <br><br>I was going to say inb4 that guy who posts the F/HA scene but fuck you, you're fast.</br></br>  <br>Isn't the puppet imperfect though and they are hoping to find Touko in order to obtain a better version?</br>  <br>I always forget to download the final patch, I still have the version with that scene untranslated.</br>  <br> Rin is the only heroine that actually kisses Shirou. <br><br>Retconned in Realta Nua, Saber is the one who kisses Shirou, not Rin.</br></br></br>  <br>It's from exposed to Rider's testosterone radiation.</br>  <br>they aren't hand holding, idiots. they are shaking hands as making a deal.</br>  <br> He'll travel the world heroing it up with Rin by his side most of the time. <br>Nice fanfic. She said she'll go back to the Clock Tower eventually and in the ending, Shirou is alone.</br></br>  <br>No his original body was fine, the circuits in the puppet are fucked up. At least read the novel.</br>  <br>The ending was symbolism. It wasn't a literal scene. Look at Nasu's notes for it.<br><br>And he's still with Rin, he just isn't gonna travel with her 100% of the time.</br></br></br>  <br> The ending was symbolism. <br><br>Sure, keep telling yourself that.</br></br></br>  <br> *Desert scene <br> After the end credits. A desert scene, same as the opening. <br> Shirou walks alone. His strength falters and he stops walking. <br> Shirou looks down to shield his eyes from the sandstorm, and sees traces of someone else having been there (the place where Archer stopped). <br> Shirou breathes out and looks up. There's fake endurance in his expression, but it's full of hope. <br> Shirou walks away with a steady gait. <br> The camera lingers on the traces of Archer's presence, and watches Shirou leave as the shot ends. <br> (If you want to make it easier to understand, after Shirou leaves, you can add Archer appearing in that spot and watching Shirou off... but I think you shouldn't.) <br><br>The previous scene was Rin talking about Shirou going farther than Archer. This was the visualization of that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No they both will settle down after everything and they will have a happy ending. The desert scene is symbolic.</br>  <br>They agree to settle down together and shake hands agreeing to a happy ending for themselves as the camera zooms out to end the show. What more did you need to see?</br>  <br>It serves both purposes.</br>  <br><br> grasping denial <br><br>Their happy endings is Shirou eventually executed but happy he travelled his path and Rin eventually marrying someone who gives her a good child to pass the crest happy she helped Shirou before they parted ways.<br><br><br>Nothing there says it's symbolic, it's similar to the answer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not seeing the lewd movements <br>You need to be 18 and older to be here.</br></br>  <br>Okay, thanks for the fanfiction brainstorming. Watch the episode sometime.</br>  <br>I've seen you before. You're the guy who kept on saying Rin and Shirou were just friends after the RN version, so now that you got blown the fuck out after that, you're looking for something new.</br>  <br>You can keep grasping, your denial just smells of sweet butthurt.</br>  <br><br> Retconned in Realta Nua <br>RN is not more canon than the pc version faggot<br>they just can't sell the eroge on anything but PC. They just had an R18 re-release on PC in 2014.</br></br></br></br>  I want to beat the piss out of Luvia  <br>And Im still wondering how can I get the Ufotable version.</br>  <br>I want Luvia to beat the piss out of me.</br>  <br>I'm sorry, I can't hear you. There's no kiss scene.</br>  <br><br>I want to piss on Luvia.</br></br>  <br>If only we knew then.</br>    <br>please tell me this is a joke</br>    <br><br>So who won that fight?</br></br>  <br>And yet she is still pregnant.</br>  <br><br>Kyon, stay in your own universe ok?<br><br>Just ask Haruhi to put her hair in a ponytail again</br></br></br></br>  <br> my dick </br>  Do you think Luvia puts her ear to the wall and masturbates furiously to the sound of Rin and Shirou making love?  <br>She can just join them.</br>  <br><br><br><br>I want Luvia to piss on me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>charm increased intensely</br>  <br><br>Well, Rin did the same to Shirou and Sabar fucking, so there's precedent.</br></br>  <br>Shirou.</br>  So, did Shirou return the wayward King of the Britons to her home. And having no further concern, he and his companions sought adventure in the West. Many wars and feuds did EMIYA fight. Honor and fear were heaped upon his name and, in time, he became a Hero of Justice by his own hand. But that is a story for another time...  <br> You will never be exposed to best Rider's testosterone radiation </br>  who was that guy Shirou walked by and said he recognized? Kokutou? Shiki? I'm not sure.  He was reminded of his best bro, Issei, from highschool--hence the nostalgic memory.<br><br>Shirou misses his afternoon tea time.</br></br>  <br> Twice H. Pieceman.</br>  <br>Holy shit it is, isnt it?</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Sakura has anger management problems.</br>  <br>A-at least spoiler that, Anon!</br>  <br> Female Nobunaga with chaingun <br>What anime? I think I missed it.</br></br>  <br>nobunagun<br>don't bother though, it was shit</br></br>  <br>I hope not.</br>  <br>But Twice would be in his 30s</br>  <br><br>I think it's more about resolving a 'will they won't they' issue. Skipping the jackhammer scene, still having Rin be tsun, Shirou being all 'hands off my wench' is a strange mixed bag that could be interpreted different ways. That and people just want some fucking onscreen resolution to the issue.<br><br> Anime just needs more canonical couples who actually fuck and not bait for 24 episodes before a kiss with a 'they might stay together after declaring I love you' open end. </br></br></br></br>  <br>We know they're fucking thanks to that script page though.</br>  <br>I wouldn't kiss someone that pleases old men either.</br>    <br><br><br><br>I can see it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn, I remember that thread. Do you still have all the edits saved, anon?</br>  <br>Nevermind, found it. My memory is still in good shape it seems.</br>  <br><br><br>She just doesn't look right without her stockings.</br></br></br>  fuck you guys what's wrong with expecting a kiss   Shirou is living with Rin <br> She lies in his lap <br> Never see them kiss <br>Why does ufotable hate money?</br></br></br>  <br>Hate to be that guy, but  source? </br>  <br> like rabbits </br>  reproductive  RN Shirou has no sex drive. Go and read it, he's pure.  <br>Sure buddy.</br>  <br> Rin and Archer <br><br>OTP</br></br></br>  <br>It's Shirou, bro. He's just got that Archer swole now.</br>  <br>It's Archer, bro. Shirou doesn't have narrow eyes.</br>  <br>ignore him he is just a shitposter and think that RN is more canon probably a wormslutfag</br>   ufotable still promoting fate/zero <br><br>They know where the money is.</br></br>  <br>Where is that picture even from?<br><br>It's posted fucking everywhere.</br></br></br>  <br>It's obvious.</br>  <br>Rin's VA posted it on twitter</br>  <br>It's the front page of the script Rin's VA had for this episode.</br>  <br>Holy shit, the end was cute.</br>  <br>she's wonderful</br>   script covers are accurate representation of what happens in the show <br><br>Sure, Shinji was so happy he had the Grail, right? Are shipperfags so desperate to prove they have a nonplatonic relationship that resort on fanservice where 'Shirou' resembles Archer to make it more acceptable to the Japanese fanbase that largely ships Rin with Archer? That's a backhanded compliment. Grow a brain.</br></br>   Staying in Chelsea, London. <br> Never shown going to watch football in Stamford Bridge ONCE. <br>What a waste</br></br>  <br> This much salt <br><br>Look at that Rin. She's the same version as the one in London two years later. She and Shirou are fucking. Deal with it, brother.</br></br></br>  Dem wavering/expectant eyes during this scene. I could hear Rin mentally chanting "don't say 'no', don't say 'no', ..." in this shot.  <br> The syrupy magma breaks through the hard bedrock <br>Jesus Christ, Nasu! I wonder how he always comes up with this nonesense.</br></br>  <br>Reminds me of that mempic with "You win the prize".</br>  <br> Salt <br><br>Nothing at all. I like they are good friends and Rin is teaching him the ropes, help him to grieve for Saber and set him on a good path for his dream. There's nothing explicitly romantic between them, so it's tasteful to most of the audience and the last shot is about lone Shirou pursuing his ideals which embodies the spirit of the route.</br></br></br>  <br> Coming inside he is my gibbest failure to date. <br>I doubt that that's Shirou's biggest failure,  Avenger </br></br>  <br>The show's translating for nips, listen to Outsider's Performance, it shows there.</br>  Shirou is fighting ISIS in 3rd world countries RIGHT NOW. What are YOU doing with YOUR life?  Nothing too romantic is show between them besides comedy scenes because they want to make a bigger deal about the love story of Heaven's Feel.  <br>Oh, it's this guy again. You're the one who was saying a while back that Rin and Shirou were just friends after the RN version. Your meme doesn't really work after this episode though, pal. You might want to move onto something else.</br>  <br> this denial </br>  <br> Sitting in his lap <br> Sleeping on his shoulder <br> Holding hands <br> Implied rabid fucking <br><br>I'm sorry bro that you didn't get any new HF stuff today.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sakura pls</br>  <br>This, on the other hand, was what came in mind.</br>  <br>What the fuck is this from?</br>  <br>They're gonna get their happily ever after.</br>  <br>Lurk more.</br>  <br> Sitting in his lap <br> Sleeping on his shoulder <br>Those were cute, but not very romantic. <br><br> Holding hands <br>Shaking hands. They should have been embracing if they wanted romance.<br><br> Implied rabid fucking <br>This is delusional. They are very chaste.<br><br> I'm sorry bro that you didn't get any new HF stuff today. <br><br>Okay? Type Ace will have information. I'm pointing out that UBW was never a heavily romantic route, so they kept that intact. While HF has a lot of romantic melodrama, so they will heavily focus on a love story. The love story of UBW is a small sideplot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Rin's delusions <br> canon </br></br>  <br>That scene was symbolism.</br>  <br/>  <br> walking alone in a desert for a bit obviously means they've separated and will never see each other again, regardless of his reason for being in said desert alone at the moment </br>  <br> Shaking hands. <br><br>It worked as both, dumbass.<br><br> This is delusional. They are very chaste. <br><br>Sure thing, pal.<br><br> The love story of UBW is a small sideplot. <br><br>It's actually a pretty large part of the first half of the story.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dinno. Her rolling around her head in his lap seemed like upper tier casual intimacy to me. Outside of onscreen nuzzling and fucking, they acted like more than just friends, especially if you know how reserved Tousaka's baseline personality is.</br>  <br>Anyone who wants to see unreserved Rin should play hollow. After three years from London, she becomes unabashed as fuck.</br>  <br>Reminder that CCC makes this canon and inevitable.</br>  <br> Rin and Shirou going on a desert trip. <br> Shirou out for a morning walk <br> Why's this anime camera pointed at me? Maybe if I ignore it it will go away. </br></br></br>    <br>I bet that was her most wettest dream...</br>  <br>give me the full picture, please.</br>  <br>Just look at the rin tag in sankakucomplex you'll be fine on your own</br>  <br>rin is too popular, cant have her kiss onscreen or the otaku will feel betrayed</br>    <br><br> http://exhentai.org/g/825289/e4866d<wbr>ecaa/</wbr> <br>I'm actually surprised by the lack of doujins with this thematic.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm pretty sure her most wettest dream would have also included sabre as well, for her gay side.</br></br>  <br>I can't believe how long I had to look to find the VN sex scenes. I thought that would be hot shit right now. Eventually found some screencaps on Sankaku Complex but still what the fuck.</br>  <br> You will never get jackhammered in both holes by both the young naive, pure and the cynical experienced versions of your husbandos <br>Why live?</br></br>  <br>I'm not normie or degenerate enough to get off to this.<br><br>But fuck...</br></br></br>  <br> Not a trio with lancer <br>No hole forgotten <br><br><br>this is pretty much the real reason. Those pillows won't sell themselves</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Tohsaka likes both. It's fact.</br></br>    I still can't believe we got London adventures.  <br>I know. Like, I didn't set my expectations too high with the Epilogue. I thought we'd get a short recap of what happened after the war, then like, 90% of it being the school stuff.</br>  <br>vita op &gt;*</br>  <br> Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone - June 30 1997 <br> Fate/stay night - January 30, 2004 <br><br>B R A V O N A S U<br>R<br>A<br>V<br>O</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You didn't. You got Shirou's London angst about disliking being there and wasting two years when he wanted to fuck off.</br>  <br>Saber really tingly Tohsaka's female boner. I don't really know why though, it's probably just for the sake of "having" her or something</br>  <br>So just like when I went to college?<br><br>Based Shirou</br></br></br>  <br> Not having RESPECT FOR THE DEAD MAN <br>When will we see Nobunaga summoned in a real Fate series?</br></br>  <br>He enjoyed attending the school, it's just he didn't want to be tied to the association.</br>  IsseixShirou is still the one true OTP, prove me wrong.  <br>Because Saber is the real harem master in Fate. The majority of the people she meets fall for her or think she's the most perfect and flawless being and must have her.<br><br>Her dragon core must be laced with pheromones. Rin was dripping wet when Saber was about to kill her.</br></br></br>  <br>I felt like they were pushing Issei with Ayako this episode.</br>  <br>He was there for half a year and he is missing 3 more years that he will complete. Two years was referring to the holy grail war.</br>  <br>Only since you asked</br>  <br>This<br>IsseiXAyako is now a thing.</br></br>   I began by thinking that #25's script was "mostly original, so I should write this as a side story to the original [the VN] story." <br> And so I, Kinoko, was at my wits end trying to write something approximating a screenplay. <br><br> That's right. You know what I mean. In other words, I bit off more than I could chew again. Fuck! <br><br> Thus we drastically cut the parts that weren't needed for an anime... but the generous people at Aniplex said, "It would be a waste if all of your Nasu-san's work was cut, so let's include it as a special in the second box set." <br> Those of you interested in what was cut (Luvia's turn to shine and Luvia's turn to shine and Luvia's turn to shine, etc.) should check out the second box set. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There's more <br>Fucking based.</br></br>  <br><br>But Rider does the same thing as well. She makes Rin wet.</br></br>  <br>I always assumed reading the VN he had a crush on Rin, not Shirou, is homo Issei just a maymay?</br>  <br> Luvia's turn to shine <br><br>Confirmed for no sales.</br></br></br>  Canonically would never be happy together and their children would be degraded in terms of magic talent since Shirou has no real talent and his RM obviously is not hereditary.  <br>That's just rider natural sex appeal and experience on turning people on</br>  <br>shirou ruined issei for marriage</br>  <br> Canonically would never be happy together <br><br>Literally not true. They're gonna end up happy as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>Neither Rin or Shirou care about that<br>Only Tokiomi really cared about that</br></br>  <br> and his RM obviously is not hereditary. <br> Shove avalon inside baby <br> $$$ </br></br></br>  <br><br>No one would want Ayako, she's damaged goods.</br></br>  <br> Those of you interested in what was cut (Luvia's turn to shine and Luvia's turn to shine and Luvia's turn to shine, etc.) <br>That's me</br></br>  <br> SG <br>sorry. But what?<br><br><br>shinji would</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Luvia's turn to shine and Luvia's turn to shine and Luvia's turn to shine </br>  <br>Secret Garden. It's a thing in CCC.<br><br>That one's talking about Tsunderes, and is basically saying Dere Rin from HA is legit.</br></br></br>  So UBW Rin<br> loses her family crest <br> loses her dignity in hands of Luvia who is fucking Shirou on he side <br> becomes a college drop out <br> she's probably forced to say in a mudslide house, waiting for Shirou wearing a Burqa.  <br><br>Great life choices.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirou has no interesting in kids. Why the fuck does this matter?</br>  <br> Shirou has no interesting in kids </br>  <br>I can even read a fanfic about it, holy shit, they played with my dick to much in this episode.</br>    <br> The brown man gets the brown eye </br>  <br>He's a lolicon, but he doesn't want to have kids. He never speaks of wanting kids at all. He just wants to be a hero of justice. Kids would get in the way.</br>  <br>He's going to have to have a kid with Rin at some point.</br>  <br>does no female knows shit about "morning wood"?</br>  <br>so what happen to Rin?</br>  <br>She travels with him a lot and at some point they mostly settle down with Shirou taking random trips to walk through deserts looking to beat people up.</br>  <br>Why? It's not in his plans nor are in hers. She destroyed her family crest, she doesn't have any legacy to pass on anymore. So she doesn't have to have children anymore.<br><br>Traveling with a kid to dangerous places would be kind of shitty too. So it's better to be childfree.</br></br></br>  <br>perfection, I can imagine London Rin regretting wasting the only chance she had to had her husbando inside of her twice at the same time</br>  <br> Implying she doesn't know exactly what she's doing </br>  <br>That Desert scene was just symbolism. see </br>  <br>She went back to college and married in a family with a crest to pass on.</br>  <br>They both finish Magic college in 3 years and she goes with him, after everything is settled they live a happy life together.</br>  <br>They're going to settle down at some point. The anime talks about it. </br>  <br>You think a save-all guy like him would let her go with him to kill ISIS? She's waiting for him in their house.</br>  <br>What would happen of Shirou if she dies of him because of one of his "adventures" though. Wouldn't that just make him go 180 back to "eternal despair path"?</br>  <br> after everything is settled <br><br>You understand what are you saying? Nothing is 'settled' because Shirou will die executed. He'll be happy when he dies, but the future is set on stone, it's repeated twice. Their idea of happy ending is likely getting hanged together.<br><br>Shirou can't just stop being a hero of justice and the world will continue to be unfair so he'll be busy. It's not a job that has a retirement until he dies.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You missed the entire point of the ending, buddy. It was Shirou being able to surpass Archer.</br>  <br>That's because this Rin wants Shirou as Archer, not Shirou the "muh hero of justice"<br><br>Basically Shirou got cucked by his future self. They should just call this Cuck/Stray Night - Unlimited Cuck Works.</br></br></br>  <br>No, you're interpretation that as "they are going to settle." Their happy ending can be dying together. Shirou and Archer were both happy as fuck to die as they did.<br><br>Nowhere Rin says they'll settle, they'll have a happy ending, which in UBW it means accepting your deaths and move on as long as you don't have regret in the path you walk on. Stop with your stupid homely fantasy.</br></br></br>  <br>He would use his swords to resurrect Kotomine and try to summon Avenger with him. Humanity killed his waifu, they don't deserve to live.</br>  <br> cuck <br>nice meme now you should go back to </br></br>  <br>I bet you're Australian.</br>  So in the end [ubw tv] did Shirou = CG in the end same to Archer?  <br>I would love to discuss your fan wank another time.

He had sex with Sakura. <br>And was about to rape her in HF but she stopped him.</br></br>  <br> hearth </br>    <br><br>First time he rapes her is well before the beginning of high school, most probably early middle school. I might be wrong on the middle school thing, it's been like half a decade since I played the VN. But it was before Shinji entered high school for sure.</br></br>  <br>She didn't really mind much. She didn't even have a boy she liked, and what with all that Zouken had put her through she didn't mind. <br>If anything she liked it to an extent because it was helping Shinji cope while giving herself relief to some extent.</br></br>  <br><br>The worms also zonked up her libido like crazy, I know.<br><br>I still consider everything the Matou family did to her as rape though, all memes aside.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The problem with ufo doing Rin is for every pic image like that you have 10 more with her horribly misdrawn.<br><br>It's not Rins design just ufo being ufo.</br></br></br>  <br>Commit seppuku when it's getting good</br>  <br>He does not rape her in RN which is what this route is based on.</br>  <br>Does she still have sex with him then?<br><br>Is there even a non TM series that has the same amount of sexual abuse for characters? Nasu is rather craycray.</br></br></br>  <br>why does sakura care about shinji? isnt he raping and beating her in this route?</br>  <br>In RN no, only worms. He is only abusive.</br>  Why is she suddenly so smug? Because the rapist can't move?  <br>Shinji...I don't get why he gets all the hate on /a/. FSN is just written to make him out as the bad guy, when really he's no worse than any of the 'protagonists' and a better person than most of them.<br><br>What are the main complaints? He raped Sakura and stole Rider to use in the war?<br><br>Okay, let's get this straight. He never fucking raped Sakura. He never did it. He never did it. He never did it. He never did it. He fucked Sakura.<br><br>Let me ask you this. WHO IN THE GAME DIDN'T FUCK SAKURA? You can't even name one fucking character who hasn't plugged her loose cunt! She is the kind of bitch who will act like she doesn't want it when she really does. She'll say No! while having multiple orgasms. Shinji knew this, he's a fucking ladies man. He knows what filthy whores like Sakura want.<br><br>And there's this other big bitch you guys have with him. He supposedly stole Rider and used her in the war for his own greed.<br><br>Objection! He was worried about his one and only precious sister. Is keeping your loved ones from a brutal war so wrong? When Shirou does the same thing to Saber it's like 'oh he's so manly', but when Shinji does it it's wrong? He just wanted to protect Sakura. He probably was going to use his Holy Grail wish to tighten her cunt back up or cure her syphilis or something.<br><br>The story was written to make that faggot Shirou look good. Objectively, Shinji is a far better character than Shirou. At least he has the balls to take action decisively instead of dicking around like Shirou, and if he weren't stuck with the weak ass servant Rider and no plothax he probably would have won the war.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice try Shinji</br>  <br>How people can hates shinji , he's the only good master with kotomine .</br>  <br><br>That wasn't true at all.<br><br>She pitied him because she knew he wanted to be a magus so badly, but couldn't accept the reality that there was no heir in the Matou family anymore, and the family was defunct a long time ago. Basically he and Byakuya (at the beginning) thought they would be on easy street, and Sakura, Kariya, and the other Matou family members understood what the family was really like, a sinking ship thanks to Zouken. <br><br>She resisted him in the beginning, so he used her pity against her. He can't make her feel better since he isn't a magus, and has little life energy. Sakura never needed a huge amount of energy because like Rin, she had a huge capacity, and the worms rarely got her to the point she needs to receive energy, since she would recover it naturally before she goes into power saving mode aka the horniness. She is just on the edge all the time due to Zouken's experiments and torture when she disboeys.<br><br>Shinji just blackmailed her every time she told him no, saying if she was really sorry for ruining his life, she would do as he says. That continued for three years starting three years prior to the VN.<br><br>Here she is probably just glad he got humbled a bit. She is just a decent person, so he gets easily forgiven.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't eat apple because it's ramadan.</br>  <br>That apple slice looked a fish at first.</br>  <br>I don't see how any of that contradicts what I said at all. <br>The point is that Sakura consented. because she did.</br></br>  <br>They skipped the part where Shinji actually reflects on himself in the hospital.</br>  <br>The Shinji scene wasn't even in the VN to begin with. Rin (or Shirou, can't remember which) only mentioned Sakura was taking care of him in the hospital.</br>  <br>What if Shinji was the MC and the theme wasn't about seigi no mikata but mental growth to accept who you are.<br><br>...wait, I think another Shinji went through that already.</br></br></br>  <br>One of FSNs biggest shortcoming to me is its main character.<br><br>Every slightly likeable person has its own cult of followers, be they major characters or insignificant side characters, even Assassin who despite being depicted as ignored and unloved at least gets some attention.<br><br>Shirou on the other hand, is bland, uninteresting, and often downright annoying. Outside of PEOPLE DIE WHEN THEY ARE KILLED LOL, he never gets any mention.<br><br>Shirou has no interesting power, is irritating, is always fucking stupid, and goes around harassing and moralfagging the shit out of everyone, knowing full well they can't retaliate, despite her being relatively weak as shit. The only reason half the cast hasn't gibbed him at first sight when confronted is because of the PLOT HAX, that's it. And he very much exploits this plotshield to make everyone's life miserable.<br><br>And yet this retard, who nobody wants as his husbando, is the main character. Wonderful.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Shiki on the other hand, is bland, uninteresting, and often downright annoying. <br>kek</br></br>  You listen to music while you read manga, right?

Please keep on victim blaming, you piece of shit pedophile.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm just waiting for this to turn into a "why men can't accuse women of rape"</br>  Seriously, guys, this "the elementary schooler raped the college student" shit is beyond obvious bait.

The nine year old forced herself on me! </br>  All those years of following this manga for nothing.  <br>because it wasn't interesting. mx0 and double arts were less interesting than naruto so Editor in chief had to drop them</br>  <br>does this only occur in the manga? I only watched the anime. do you remember the chapter?</br>  <br>Because the author managed to drive his manga and its sales straight into the ground in just two volumes, and then gave a shitty rushed ending and an "epilogue" chapter that literally resolved nothing, and it was the fucking Mx0 guy, which just made it worse.</br>  <br>Fuck, I wish I never get to know this series.</br>  <br> AVG <br><br>I'm pissed!</br></br></br>  <br>Truly a waste. At least early on she commented on how it was destined that they will fuck.</br>  As a Vampire he is basically immune to physical injury, so   how was Jotaro able to destroy him by punching his already wounded leg? Didn't they say hamon/destroying his brain was the key to stopping him?    <br>he was mad.</br>  <br>He destroyed his spirit</br>  Just another thing they forget when writing the trainwreck that is part 3.<br><br>Remember when stand users can use telepathy to talk to each other? Kakyoin sure didn't, so he shot a clock instead.</br></br>  His stand didn't have the vampire attributes and every injury that is inflicted on the stand the user also endures. He would've regenerate in time, but they put his remains out in the sun to dry, before he could.  Yes vampires are immortal but Jotaro destroyed the world.  <br> Remember when stand users can use telepathy to talk to each other? <br>What? When did they do that?</br></br>  <br><br><br>Didn't the telepathy work by having the stand users talk to one another?<br><br>Which would be difficult to do if the users are too far apart, since the stands have a range limit?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>stands*, not stand uers</br>  <br> Remember when stand users can use telepathy to talk to each other? <br>No?</br></br>  <br>due to the fact that the world wasn't a vampire killing the world would kill dio. I think it would also be reasonable that the world could function in sunlight as well</br>  <br>Never, he's just making things up since he can't read and has a need to "fit in".</br>  <br>I never understood the telepathy thing either. During Jotaro's baseball video game match with D'Arby the younger Joseph controls his controller with hermit purple. After their fight Jotaro says something to the effect of "I'm glad I was able to catch on to your plan" and Joseph says "of course you did, that's because you're my grandson" which implies that they did NOT use telepathy to communicate.</br>  Jotaro destroyed his stand, and when a stand is destroyed, so is user unless the stand is automatic. This applies to vampires.  <br>Back when they faced Dark Blue Moon on the boat, when they went underwater, they could communicate with each other.</br>  <br><br>this</br></br>  Hinjaku hinjakuuu  Isn't it because the enemy stand users would be able to hear them too?<br><br>It doesn't work like telepathy.<br>Just a way for ALL the stand users to communicate outside of the 'normal' realm</br></br></br>  remember dio's ice powers?<br>remember arabia fats who could instantly KO dio?<br>remember Polnareff's silver chariot cloning technique?<br>remember Kakyoin's psychic ability to injure people he paints?<br>remember dio's vampire stub ability that he could have used to defeat jotaro from a distance instead of throwing knives everywhere?<br>remember how Joseph told Avdol to burn down the mansion in case they don't return?<br>now what would dio do if his mansion was burned down into rubble during sunlight?<br>what would dio do if the heroes actually looked for dio in the rubble unlike what jonathan did in part 1?<br>hmm</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>That's not telepathy you retards, that's just talking through your stands.<br><br>Same way Star Platinum says ORA ORA, it's not him, it's Jotaro saying it. Just ventriloquy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> remember how Joseph told Avdol to burn down the mansion in case they don't return? <br>I'm not sure if that's anime only as I haven't read the part 1-3 mangas, but they do mention it, they just get sidetracked by the fact they can't burn an illusion.</br></br>  <br>Abdul said there was no fucking way to burn the entire mansion anyway and he trusted Joseph and Jotaro too much to do that.</br>  <br> Same way Star Platinum says ORA ORA, it's not him, it's Jotaro saying it. <br> it's Jotaro saying it. </br></br>  <br>Ah.....that makes more sense</br>  <br> remember dio's ice powers? <br>He needs to touch Jotaro to do that and he doesn't want to get close<br> remember Polnareff's silver chariot cloning technique? <br>It's not cloning they are afterimages<br> remember Kakyoin's psychic ability to injure people he paints? <br>It was Hierofant attacking Jotaro it has nothing to do with the painting<br> remember dio's vampire stub ability that he could have used to defeat jotaro from a distance instead of throwing knives everywhere? <br>I do, but Araki doesn't<br> remember how Joseph told Avdol to burn down the mansion in case they don't return? <br>Abdul mentioned why he didn't do it<br> now what would dio do if his mansion was burned down into rubble during sunlight? <br>probably bury himself underground</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was just shown in the Dark Blue Moon episode in order to talk underwater, and no it was not telepathy, it was just the stands outright talking to each other.</br>  <br>we already know he's autistic</br>  <br> probably bury himself underground <br>Iggy, Joseph and Avdul could easily find him</br></br>  <br>The whole point of the episode was to have a co-op between Jotaro and Joseph. D'arby could read minds, but they need not to: "of course I know what's on your mind, you're my grandson!" which is some sort of "moral" superiority, a spiritual bond as opposed to a forced one (Atum's power).<br><br>How can you guys miss these excessively evident subtexts and come up with even more complicated stand powers to justify what's already written in the manga is beyond me.</br></br></br>  <br>I also don't get why the ripple was dropped completly even though it is also useful for healing.</br>  <br>You're talking about people who can't even grasp shit like Psycho Pass, where almost everything is literally directly stated. I was about to turn this post into a rant about low IQ, foreigners and doing things that you don't truly enjoy deep down just to feel socially accepted but I'll refrain.</br>  <br>And for making sure you don't end up a senile old geezer who needs a crane to walk at just 70 years old.<br><br>Araki is like a kid who found a new toy and immediately discarded the old one even though it had its uses.</br></br></br>  <br>good, keep your mouth shut, nerd</br>  <br> &gt;remember Polnareff's silver chariot cloning technique? <br>Rather say<br> remember Polnareff's cast off ability he never used again? </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, well at least JoJo has so much variety in it that it can be liked for many different reasons, even just for action and "uniqueness" itself. I think they're missing out a lot though.</br>  So I'm just going through part 4, is it me or did Jotaro lose all his gains?   why didn't sun kill dio <br>And how the fuck would he know?<br><br>Do you really think that Dio hired a bunch of stand users and told them that he is a vampire who can be killed by sunlight.</br></br></br>  <br>Compared to</br>  <br><br>Its just the art style shift. He might of lost some muscle due to the fact he doesn't fight anymore, but Araki changed to representing people with a more athletic build than mountain of a man build.</br></br>  <br>He looks better in Part 4. Part 3 Jotaro was a fucking monster. Although he looks his worst in Part 6.</br>  <br>Joseph is a lazy asshole, but you'd think he'd at least practice something that would keep his body working well.</br>  <br>Wasn't he 15 years old there? and something like 190 cm ? Damn JoJo genes.</br>  <br>Araki just shifted from bara to yaoi.</br>  <br> Joseph is a lazy asshole, but you'd think he'd at least practice something that would keep his body working well. <br>Counterpoint: Fat people exist.</br></br>  <br>Joseph is american anon. It doesn't work.</br>  <br>...it really is, why are you looking at me like that, reaction image?</br>  <br>Yes....I understand the point of them working together as a team and defeating D'Arby instead of cheating with a mind reading stand, I just think it's dumb that he introduces abilities/concepts and then completely forgets about them.</br>  <br>Yeah but he didn't lose his autism.<br>He also jobs to a rat.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure most of his minions were aware that he was not human, as evidenced by his fangs/dead hookers on the ground whose blood he sucked.</br>  <br>There's no telepathy at all, people can just talk through their stands, or do you think DIO was using telepathy to broadcast the MUDA MUDA MUDAs from The World to Jotaro?</br>  <br>Why didn't death 13 kill Dio</br>  <br> expecting Benjamin Button to do anything useful ever </br>  <br>I guess the idea is that less and less people practiced the ripple as time went on, making it less common/useful (people like Ton Petty, Straits and Lisa Lisa were rare, it's not like it was a widespread thing).<br><br> Even if they were to have a practicing ripple master on their team, he would basically only be good for healing. Combat-wise there is very little a hamon user can do against a stand,   but I do miss Joseph shooting cola caps/strands of hair at people  </br></br></br>  <br>Starting part 6 the art makes me unable to understand what the fuck is going on most of the time.</br>  This fucking thread again.<br><br>The World got destroyed. DIO had his knee/left leg severed and kicked all within a very short time frame, and then Jotaro punched that same leg with Star Plat. If a stand is basically a representation of a person's spirit, then its destruction means you fucking die not matter /what/ you are.<br><br>You could argue that having a stand is kind of a double-edged sword if you're a vampire, considering you'd be much safer without it, but then again, having a stand can be pretty useful. Blame it on DIO for getting a stand in the first place.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The point still stands that telepathy was never used, you're just thinking of Dark Blue Moon episode and that was not telepathy but straight up talking with stands - because they are not material so it makes no difference for them to be underwater or not, they can still produce sounds.</br>  <br>Uhh when they were underwater getting fucked up?</br>  <br>Without a stand, they could have just wrecked Dio and threw him into sunlight without any problems.</br>  <br>That's not very nice anon.<br><br> but it is hilarious </br></br></br>  <br>I can only wish I'd look this good at his age.</br>  <br> You could argue that having a stand is kind of a double-edged sword if you're a vampire <br><br>Standless DIO would have a pretty rough time considering he wouldn't be able to see Star Platinum</br></br></br>  <br>Exactly. The stand's power is an advantage, but the fact that its destruction fucking kills you is a disadvantage as well.</br>  Gee, that Anthony Shoemaker guy in the Jojo groups is SOOOO mean, let's talk about how mean he is.  <br>When I was 15 I was 188 cm, so it's not too crazy</br>   No vampire with hamon, spin, and a stand that utilizes the combined abilities of the above   <br>Are you 70?</br>  <br>Would've made for some pretty hilarious fights though.</br>  <br>Part 5 is also nigh impossible to understand during the fight scenes, but that might be the shitty stands.</br>  <br> vampire with hamon </br>  <br>*shitty scans</br>  <br>If Dio was Standless there wouln't be a reason for the Joestars to actually hunt him (maybe for having the body of Jonathan)</br>  <br>Straizo had hamon and using it killed him.</br>  <br> didn't read part 2 </br>  <br>Are you japanese though?</br>  <br>The excuse that I thought it was that Jotaro destroyed The World, and unlike DIO The World can regenerate.<br> Or maybe Araki forgot about that. </br></br>  huge amount of wasted potential with the alessi arc, coulda had him turn old joseph into young joseph and have him get his ass beaten, instead jotaro gets turned into a kid and kicks his ass anyway  <br>*can't regenerate.</br>  <br> DIO throws a bunch of flesh buds at them <br> They are instantly incinerated by hermit purple and magician's red <br> "FUCK!!" </br></br></br>  <br>Kars wasn't a vampire by the end, just the ultimate lifeform. If you lose weakness to sun and the need for blood, you're not a fucking vampire.</br>  <br>That would really weird to see Part 2 Joe among the part 3 art style but also sick as fuck</br>  <br>DIO is a much weaker vampire than he was in Part 1, on account of the new non-vampiric body that he's still trying to control. He mentions how his left side heals slower than his right, and much slower than he ever has, and he also no longer has ice powers or eye lasers. DIO is like 10% of the vampire he used to be, but The World mostly makes up for it.<br><br>And yea, killing The World would probably still fuck DIO up despite being a vampire.</br></br></br>  <br> doesn't remember who straits was </br>  <br>Does /a/ have any good drawfags/fanficfags?<br><br> The secret of DIO's 「Stand」 is... no 「Stand」?! </br></br></br>  <br>I remember, but I don't remember him using hamon after he turned into one. Shit, please tell me it didn't happen, I'm usually really autistic about details.</br>  <br>Hamon is basically The Force dude. It can control the weak-minded, let you jump 50 feet into the air, heal, weaponize basically any object, gives you a fucking sick bod and enables a 50-something to look half her age.</br>  Why didn't Dio just use stingy eyes space ripper after stopping time to kill Jotaro?  <br> That dwarf Koichi <br>Araki please</br></br>  <br>He used it to kill himself quicker right after he told Joseph Speedywagon was still alive.</br>  .  Go back to bed. You're not fully grown yet.  Can I rape it?  Did she just die?  Dat buttcrack doh  cookie dough  <br>Why is she lying down like that?</br>  <br>Maybe her butt hurts.</br>  <br>Chii-chan, matta da yo</br>  <br>No.</br>  As someone with actual pedophilic disorder, I don't find 4chan's super-edgy way of objectifying ("it" above) and making rape jokes about children, 2D or otherwise.<br><br>You should feel ashamed.</br></br>  <br><br>Amazing how an innocent looking show manages to smuggle in such a tiny detail.<br><br><br>Sucks to be you.</br></br></br></br></br>  Is the current state of anime adaptations of certain LNs/manga inherently an unsatisfying and flawed method of storytelling? Tons of shows in the past ~5-10 years have had inconclusive and/or open endings due to either catching up to the source material and not being able to create an original ending that satisfies everyone, or due to a desire to not piss off waifufags and otaku who are pretty much the only people who buy the source material. <br><br>Why is this acceptable? How many times can people accept being disappointed by yet another "Nobody wins! Things just go on like this forever! The end!"?</br></br>  <br>Never.</br>  <br>I'd cum on her glasses then make the other girl lick them clean. Of course it would still be blurry as hell so the glasses girl would be walking around naked and stumbling into stuff.</br>  because fucking companies make money promoting and selling anime related materials and is not doing business to please a lowlife otaku like you. Don't you see why something like Evangelion is still getting mliked today?  <br> Don't you see why something like Evangelion is still getting mliked today? <br>Because its ending was an amazing trip that has not been matched since?</br></br>  <br>because if they have given Eva the proper ending during it's success the franchise would have had to rely on how much fans appreciate it before they move on to something else when the time comes eva is forgotten and people have moved on. <br><br>I won't name any title but you can think of an anime that aired years ago that had a proper ending but is still getting sales(figs, pachinko apps, even children toys)  protip you cant etc </br></br></br>  It's here folks, get it while it's hot  <br> Now we wait and suffer until real subs come out <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br>  <br><br> Now we suffer <br>Fix'd</br></br></br>  Anons, start posting lewd fairies. We are heading to the archive soon.  <br>REAL SUBS WHEN<br>REAL SUBS WHEN<br>REAL SUBS WHEN<br>REAL SUBS WHEN</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why hasn't a group that lies less done this? Don't they do this for the epeen?</br></br>  Can i skip seaon 2 of Stardust Crusaders?<br>It's so goddamn boring</br>  <br>what is this? image for ant?</br>  <br>You're a big boy now.
