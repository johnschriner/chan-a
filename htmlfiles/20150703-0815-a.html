As you can see, it works.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> A minimum of 3 highschool girls in each one of these pictures <br> implying a bunch of k-on rejects are best anything <br>kill yourself</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice sarcastic hypocrisy. My post was very justified though.</br>    <br> Moefags are /a/'s largest demographic <br>No, they're just the most vocal.</br></br>  <br>Do you not like cute girls or something? You gay, son?</br>  <br>Kiniro Mosaic is the most boring and plain SoL maybe ever made. It doesn't deserve best anything. It's just there.</br>  <br>Better than your gayshit sensen.</br>  <br> Users on a discussion board talking a lot of X and little of Y, but Y has a larger fanbase, it's just that X is more vocal <br>What are discussion boards for then?</br></br>    <br> moefags aren't /a/'s largest demographic, it's just that the most posts on /a/ are made by moefags <br>Hurrrrrrrrrrrrrr. You got a better, demonstrable metric than post volume?</br></br>  <br>GochiUsa is even moreso since it's basically a KinMosa clone.<br>Lucky Star is the most boring SoL ever made.<br>A-Channel is the most plain SoL ever made.</br></br></br>  <br>Hibike isn't even gay, you faggot.</br>  <br>Discussion. But saying some groups demographic is the largest because you see mostly it is like saying gays are the largest demographic in america and straights are a minority.</br>  <br>Fuck off who was talking about Hibike</br>   permavirgin moeshitters   <br> it is like saying gays are the largest demographic in america and straights are a minority. <br><br>I really wish it was like that, that way maybe you'd hide yourself and never post on /a/ ever again.</br></br></br>  <br> This picture <br><br>Fuck off back to facebook.</br></br></br>  <br> GochiUsa is even moreso since it's basically a KinMosa clone. <br> Lucky Star is the most boring SoL ever made. <br>No because those two are actually funny and the characters don't look all samey.</br></br></br>  <br>Hell yes, a new smug Chinese cartoon girl for my collection. I fucking love smug Chinese cartoon girls.</br>  <br>But I see way more straight people on the internet than gays.</br>  <br> Replace Hibike with Hello! Kiniro Mosaic and we have a deal. <br>Read the fucking exchange you fucking shitbird.</br></br>  <br>So if I just start hourly threads and samefag them to post limit I'd single handily become a large demographic for a show even though I'm one person?<br><br>Just because you can't think of a good alternative doesn't mean you should go with a shitty one.<br><br>If you can't find a good accurate measurement for popularity there is no point in making these dumb images.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> All four pictures nothing but moeshit and yuri <br><br>And you lot keep on saying that /u/ hasn't slathered the walls with it's garbage. Sasuga /a/, your denial is impressive.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Lucky Shit's Family Guy-style reference humor <br> funny </br></br></br></br>  <br>Why don't you just shut up?</br>  <br>That's not the point. The point is that theres a thing called "The Vocal Minority", which is what moe fans are.</br>  <br>Yes anon, we know, we are all little girls. Now come here and kiss me.</br>   they swallowed the bait   <br> can't read <br> tells others to shut up <br>Yep sounds like a retard.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to swallow you.</br>  <br>It IS the point. I'm not saying vocal minorities don't exist, but moe fans on /a/ is definetely not one of them. Outside of /a/? Of course.</br>  Can we all agree that Non non biyori is the best?  <br>And you sound like a stupid hater upset because your favorite anime didn't make it.</br>  <br>Take a look at the catalog some time. Note the percentage of images at any given moment containing "moe" girls in them. Yep. It's always been that way here. Always. Early /a/'s two favorite anime? Evangelion (largely because of Asuka and Rei being moe) and Azumanga Daioh.</br>  will we ever reach a point in time where newfags on /a/ stop falling for blatantly obvious trolls? this thread is already ruined  <br>I swear you're either actually mentally retarded or just came into the thread because you saw someone insult your boring ass SoL.</br>  <br>Of course. Most well-executed iyashikei since ARIA.</br>  <br>Fate/Yahari/Hibike brought in a lot of new people.</br>  <br>What trolls? You mean the guy saying these are not /a/'s AOTSs? We all are laughing at his poor soul.</br>  <br><br>Double it if the show also contains Yuri elements.</br></br>  <br>That's an oxymoron.</br>     all SoLs are boring   <br>stuff like <br>and people who are just taking OP's post seriously in general</br></br>  <br>How's OP a troll?</br>  <br><br><br><br>The only people that even halfway think this way are pedos, I guarantee it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because  likes "shonenshit" or "deepshit" instead of "moeshit," of course.</br>  <br>Grow up faggot I post that in every obvious moetroll thread.<br>This thread was ruined the moment that picture was chosen by OP.</br></br>  <br>Yeah I thought so, fucking /v/ should just go away already.</br>  <br><br><br>Everything seems in order, except Locodol, that was plainly mediocre.</br></br></br>  <br> anime <br> "manly" <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br>Fall 2015 should be Aria.</br>  <br> except Locodol, that was plainly mediocre. <br>It was literally the comfiest show of the year, anon. The production value was mediocre but they made the most of what they had.</br></br>  <br>It's not a full series</br>  <br> het sol <br> aots <br><br>Go away.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Comfiest of the year <br> One season earlier, GochiUsa aired <br>No.</br></br></br>  <br>3 OVAs only, and gaaaaaaaaaaaah, I just can't get my hopes up THAT much expecting it to be the same quality as previous entries in the franchise. I thought about it, and I just don't want to make that leap yet. The franchise is too special to me to have that kind of expectations for it.<br>If the OVAs are at least equal to ARIA the Natural quality and /a/ discusses them on a daily basis for at least a month or two, I'll retroactively change the image.</br></br>  <br>3/4<br>Kofuku was ok, not AOTS</br></br>  My top 3 shows of 2014 are Ping Pong, Barakamon, and UBW. Fight me about it.  <br> Ping Pong <br>Cliched, pretentious aesthetic abortion.</br></br>  <br><br>This and AOTY.</br></br>  Here you go OP, I fixed that for you.  <br>For some reason this reminds me of the Inferno Cop meme. Same guy?</br>     Retarded question here <br>AOTS i s anime of the season and AOTY is anime of the year, correct?</br>  <br> the smug </br>  <br>Pretty much.<br><br>Some of these shows were actually good though and wouldn't need this kind of bait for boring shitposting we've already seen over and over.</br></br></br>  <br>The other way around.</br>  Why is KyoAni so much better at making anime than everyone else and why is Hibike! Euphonium at least 72.35 times better than Kekkai Shitsen?  <br> Not wanting to be the little girl </br>  <br> Ping Pong <br>Agree<br><br> Barakamon <br>It was a shitty season, but it's close to what I'd have chosen.<br><br> UBW <br>Shitty season AND shitty show.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  this thread is full of bait  <br>Go watch Kekgay Sensen elsewhere.</br>  <br>Both are bad. Kyoani just makes pretty turds since K-On included. With the exception of Hyouka and Nichijou</br>  <br>I think I'm going to use Kekgay Shitsux from now on. Thanks for Kekgay, that's good.</br>  <br> wanting to be little girl <br>we are all little girls in /a/</br></br>  <br>Yeah I know.</br>  <br> locodol winning summer </br>  <br>Because they love making anime and it shows. You can literally feel KyoAni's warmth when watching one of their shows.</br>  <br> hetshit </br>  <br>I think a large part of it is their organizational structure, and getting the most out of small, talented staffs.</br>  <br>Well what is defined as a 'moefag' ?<br>Liking Moe elements and characters?</br></br>  <br> using hetshit as a word unironically <br>kill /u/rself<br>Also Mikakunin is "hetshit" and is in that picture too</br></br></br>  <br>The MC is so fucking irrelevant it doesn't really mather.</br>  <br>I'll concede Chiyo as GOTS and that's as much as you'll get. Chiyo a cute.<br><br>As far as it's concerned here, people who are drawn to watch shows by the presence of cute girls in them.</br></br></br>  <br>Whatever helps you sleep at night /u/</br>   pick the biggest moeshit turds of the year and say they're aots <br><br>Nice meme!</br></br>  <br>Typical /v/ behaviour.</br>  Yuri is more aesthetically pleasing but het can be nice for self-inserting, or certain storylines that wouldn't work without it, like Clannad/Afterstory.  <br> self-inserting <br><br>Yoiu disgust me to no end</br></br></br>  <br> this nigga doesn't wanna get with a 2D QT 3.14 <br>The fuck you even doing here nigga?</br></br>  <br>I'm not a loser.</br>  <br>I usually don't self insert in shows like Clannad, the MCs personality is too defined for that. Harems like Hanagai or Yahari are more fit for self inserting</br>  <br>Again, what are you doing on /a/?</br>  <br>There are different levels of pathetic.</br>  <br>I don't know if you misinterpreted that post, but it meant "certain storylines that wouldn't work without het," not "certain storylines that wouldn't work without self-inserting."<br>But yeah. GJ-Bu's MC always seemed like the ultimate self-insert to me. Who wouldn't wanna be him? Just sit around and brush hair and get your hair brushed and get to be the little girl for a while, have a cute midget bite you every now and then, have a sexy genius ask if she can step on you, have a cute maid serve you food and tea and shit... nigga's got it made.</br></br>  <br>But that's not what moe means.</br>  <br>I know, as I've posted that image many times, but literally everyone who has ever watched anime is moefag if we use the real definition of moe. I was going more for how it's most commonly used here.</br>  <br>not even japan takes moe that literaly<br><br>who ever posts this image is a gaijin weeaboo trying too hard</br></br></br>  <br>Exactly, though, that's the entire reason the term moefag is used to figure out when people don't know what the fuck they're talking about.</br>  <br> weeaboo <br>That word does not mean what you think it means.</br></br>   people calling Yama no Susume moeshit <br><br>Did you fucks even watch it?</br></br>  <br>It's exactly what it was.</br>  <br>No they didn't, nobody watched it  except anons with impeccable taste </br>  <br> Hibike <br> not Pleiades <br>On the other hand, maybe it's for the better that Pleiades gets less negative attention.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>What about it isn't moeshit? There are various levels of moeshit. It doesn't have to be kawaii uguu to be moeshit.</br>  <br>Not wanting to use moe as a synonym for cute, since it isn't, is being a weeaboo? I thought everyone using it as such was the weeaboo because they were basically just saying something is cute but wanted to use that epic Japanese term they heard instead of just saying cute.</br>  <br><br><br>kekkai shits on all of these</br></br></br>  <br>fuck off /V/ nobody wants you here.</br>  <br> jejune, fujobaiting dreck with filtered, traced backgrounds <br> good </br></br>  <br>ass blasted moefag<br><br><br><br>better than hibkek</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>go away I told yoy</br>  <br><br><br>lmao look at this moeshit eater trying to fit in</br></br></br>  <br>fuck off /v/</br>  <br>I don't want to expose myself like this, but I saw you today shitposting on /v/. Fuck you.</br>  <br>So you are cock hungry homosexual like MC?</br>   using "moeshit" unironically   Koufuku graffiti was shit.  <br> watching moeshit unironically </br>  <br> anyone who enjoys crossdressing for any reason, including sexual submissives who enjoy the humiliation aspect of it, is automatically homosexual <br> Eddie Izzard doesn't exist </br></br>  <br>that's /v7 for you</br>   tfw all these shows getting new seasons   <br> Taking the bait </br>  <br>yo nigger is fucking YURU YURI really airing for real in fall? Like S3 for real??</br>  <br><br><br>  aka no boys allowed </br></br></br>  <br><br>Sorry to disappoint you guys but I only shitpost on /a/.</br></br>  <br><br>All Yuyus are equally threshhold filter. <br> Yukari is simply more equallier threshholderier filtererieriesterererererererererer<wbr>.</wbr>   Er. </br></br></br>  <br>Whoi the hell watches anime with males nowadays? I mean other than the MANIME fags</br>  <br>No. It's a massive ruse.</br>  <br>I agree with the bottom two. But the top 2 are just boring and lame to the extent that I wouldn't care if the girls got raped by soldiers of Allah.</br>  <br>I hate the word weeaboo, its very annoying, weeaboo is that douche bag newfag who just got into anime and is freaking out acting like their shit doesn't stink, this girl at my highschool was like that and super annoying.</br>  <br> KITAAA </br>  <br>Mikakunin, Hibike and GJ-Bu all had prominent male characters.</br>  <br>Well then,  still fuck you </br>   CGDCT boring shit <br> Ever AOTS <br>Summer AOTS is gonna be Prisma Illya <br>Fall AOTS is gonna be Valkyrie Drive</br></br></br>  <br>I don't recognize any of these shows. Do I get a prize?</br>  <br>The price of beig retarded.</br>  <br>But moeshit is for retads</br>  <br>The Official Lurkmoar Prize<br>Seriously, spring was literally the most heavily discussed show here by a long ways.</br></br>  Shitposting aside, it actually bothers me to see pretty good SoLs thrown together with mediocre ones in these charts. I know you can't have a good SoL every season, but it still hurts my autism, especially since sometimes there are better alternatives (for example Love Lab &gt; KinMoza, sorry yurifags).<br><br><br> filename <br>You're my nigga yet again.<br><br><br>Don't remind me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not even a newfag prize since they are new. I don't even know. No, no prize for you.</br>  <br>Fuck off retard.</br>  <br/>  <br><br><br> all this moe shit <br><br>Gee I wonder what group of people with shit tastes made these gems</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, Sbagebu was AOTS</br>  <br>oh right nevermind I forgot about Prism Illya aka AOTS</br>  <br>You're having a ball ITT, I reckon.</br>  <br> official and objective <br><br>This is bait</br></br></br>  <br>Wow.</br>  <br>/a/. And only /a/ could ever do it.<br>If you disagree, there are at least 3 boards I can redirect you to.</br></br>  <br>You need to replace NON NON with Prism Illya. <br><br>Prism Illya has &gt;4 lolis. Non non only has 1 loli and 1 fake loli. The other two bitches need cum in their mouths to shut them up.<br><br>Prism Illya is AOTS Summer 2015</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I avoid all shit anime that's why.</br>  <br>Oh fuck this made me bust up.</br>  Non Non Biyori?<br><br>More like Non Non IT BORES ME<br><br>Fuck moeshit, BOOYAH</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br>But Renge is the GOAT loli, anon.</br>   autistic turbonerds getting upset when someone says "moeshit"   <br>Nah, I like yuri, I rather see the girls with each other.<br><br><br>But Kinmoza is gayer than Eupho</br></br></br></br>  <br>As it should be.</br>  <br>Yeah no I agree /a/ does have shit tastes for yuri bait crap<br><br>No barakamon is an easy way to tell the slide is shit</br></br></br>  <br>Get the fuck out /v/</br>  Currently best thread on /A/  <br>dont post webms from unfunny anime please</br>  <br><br>across the board wrong<br><br>congratulations</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody who entirely discounts an entire genre of anime, any genre (well, OK, I'll allow fujoshit), belongs here.</br>  <br>Kinmosa had non stop gay.<br>But Kumiko x Reina scenes were more intense  even though they were bait </br></br>  <br>I'm not saying moeshit is bad. I just like using the term. Non Non Biyori was my AOTS for 2014.</br>  <br>Moeshit sucks.</br>  <br>2013*</br>  <br>You mean 2013. You also probably mean AotY if you're referring to an entire year.</br>  <br>''Moeshit'' is mostly used by shitposter.<br>Don't use it if you don't want to be labelled as one.</br></br>  <br> I'm not saying moeshit is bad. <br>At least put it in quotes then if you realize that it doesn't mean what most people think it means.<br><br>I'm sorry if its absurd, largely timing-based humor went over your head, anon. It's not for everyone.</br></br></br></br>  <br> /A/ </br>  Why can't fujos and /v/ leave for once and all?  <br> timing-based humor <br><br>more like unfunny-based humor, glad it sold like shit</br></br></br>  <br> more like unfunny-based humor <br>More like unfunny you.</br></br>  <br>I'm not joking, though. Seriously, get better taste in comedy.</br>  <br>Triggered?</br>  Pictured are purely platonic feelings. No sexual or romantic tension here.  I want to kill this fucking cunt.<br><br>  Ignore the denialfags, please.<br>Iroha or death. </br> </br></br>  I would die a happy man if I got a Yui end.    Iroha OP <br><br>Great, we're off to a good start I see.</br></br>  <br>Yukino has only had friendship flags with the 8man, they have absolutely no romantic feelings between them.<br><br>Yui's feelings for 8man are not genuine.<br><br>Saki was never in 8man's harem.</br></br></br></br></br>     volunteer club <br>   saize </br>  <br><br>No one is going to happy with the ending to this series.<br><br>Except the one or two friendship-only supporters.</br></br></br></br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!  <br>Just as long as you only die after sharing a long, happy life with her too.</br>  <br>Anime isn't real</br>  <br>I wish, if she's happy I'm happy.<br><br><br>Friendship end is the most likely. Most people see that, that doesn't mean people actually support it. Watari said that people will be okay with it regardless of if they understand it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Watari said that people will be okay with it regardless of if they understand it. <br>When did he say this?</br></br>  First Thursday in 13 weeks without Oregairu, what do?  <br>He never said that. He said something in the line of (IIRC) that he will write a "OregaIru" style ending that people will accept it and people won't accept it. <br><br>In other words, vague answer as always, people just like to interpret it according to what they want.</br></br></br>  <br>Post Iroha.</br>  <br>Hey, Iroha ops are the bloody best. Back before the anime started the only way to not have a shitpost infested thread was an Iroha op. <br><br>I used to make them because the animeonly people had no idea who she was, so putting Iroha as the OP was literally a way to guarantee that a thread would be devoid of shitposts. <br><br>Obviously it doesn't work anymore, but it was pretty damn fantastic at the time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>While I definitely think it's most likely to happen, I definitely would not like it.<br><br> I want to struggle and shit to reach muh genuine regardless of the consequences <br> Oh, let's just stay friends and ignore our romantic feelings. <br><br>It just wouldn't feel right.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I interpret it however I want. I like pissing people off and Hayama NTR isn't as effective so pushing the friends end agenda I manage to get reactions from YYfags.</br>  Was bored, made this.<br>Please explain what happened.</br>  <br><br>I think Hachiman is going to pick a girl but they can't be together because reasons. Probably Yukino since she has the most red flags to preclude a happy romantic ending for her.</br></br>  <br>Great trolling, friendo</br>  <br>I was thinking that the romantic feelings will flame out due to shit happening. Their friendship rises from the ashes of the house that the love triangle burned down.</br>  <br>You could've been creative and go for something like  . Since we were talking about k-drama, makes that reason cancer and your bait will get a lot of bites.</br>  <br> Hayama NTR <br>It isn't? I thought everybody would blow a fuse whenever those Hayama x Yukino/Yui posts come up. <br><br><br>Perhaps he means that the ending will seem foreshadowed to some but an asspull to others? It sounds like he's just stating the common reaction to every romcom ending in my honest opinion.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they can't be together because reasons <br>wait for me end? that's one of the worse endings <br>WW won't do that I believe</br></br></br>  <br><br>Hey I'm not shitposting. That's really what I think is going to happen, even as a Yukinofag.</br></br>  <br>Irohasu~ happened</br>  <br>If you were an author would you give straight answers or would you troll and give completely vague answers while feeling smart about yourself?</br>  <br><br>"Wait for me" suggests they make some sort of commitment to reunite. I think their romance will never even really take off outside of a general exchange of feelings because by then they'll know they're on different trajectories. So it's just sad. But they'll remain friends and their romantic feelings will dissipate with time.</br></br>  <br><br><br>To be fair that isn't all that unlikely, Yukino's position is still pretty unclear for the most part. While a lot of flags point to her, the idea that they might not actually be able to enter a relationship isn't exactly all that out of left field.</br></br></br>   final episode aired <br> one week later, 24/7 threads are still a thing <br>Why.</br></br>    <br><br>They're slowing down, give it another week and we'll just have once a week threads.</br></br>  So what exactly is she trying to do again?<br><br>Seems like she's just going after any guy other girls are interested in</br></br>  <br>We're dying, we have maybe 2-3 more threads left at best</br>  <br>You can never get off Mr. Watari's Wild Ride.</br>  Yukino and Yui are not good love interests. Both of them have a gigantic overlap in current issues, and are of similar levels of romantic interest to 8man, but the way 8man sees them is rather different: 8man admires Yukino, and looks down on/distances himself from Yui. As 8man gets to know them both as people, his image of them each will normalize- for Yui this means his image of her will improve, for Yukino this means he'll take her off a pedestal and accept she's not what he thought she was. As a result, Yui will probably overtake Yukino next volume, the fact she already has brute forced some progress between them only reinforces that.<br><br>However, there's also the fact that a great deal of Yui's progress with 8man has been on the basis of him tolerating her.The hair grooming for example was very clear on this aspect. There's the possibility 8man may give her a cold shower when he realizes it's not genuine to humor her advances while being noncommittal himself.<br><br>That said, they're both awful love interests from a narrative standpoint. The Yukino/Yui situation is a very detrimental in that beyond which makes somewhat more sense developmentally, neither romance means very much to the narrative. 8man loving (or, even worse, 'realizing' he's in love with) them doesn't contribute anything significant to the narrative, while spitting on the fact that the entirety of the story has revolved around the club becoming closer as friends. (Particularly the relationship between Yukino and Yui, which people often disregard despite being as important if not moreso as 8man's relationship with either.) No matter how you look at it, you can't write one of the club members into being a third wheel without it contradicting the central premise of the story.<br><br>Practically anything would be better than a club member romance end.

In that case it doesn't look very good for Yui.<br><br> Isn't the central premise of the story to be geniuine with your friends and not hide anything? Having all three of them ignore their feelings wouldn't make for a genuine ending at all, and even when one girl does get hurt she still has to genuinely accept it. <br>You speak as though 8man going for one of them romantically is a requirement of the writing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's always an adjective in English but gets treated like a noun all the time in these threads. That annoys me. People need to say 'genuineness' more often.</br></br>  <br>Unfortunately anon, I am afraid your conclusion is incorrect in this case. I direct you to the results of this surprisingly unproxied poll http://strawpoll.me/4798763/r<br><br>It is clear that, without a doubt, that your belief is false and Iroha is the "best girl". Thus the current poll is built upon a legitimate premise.</br></br></br>  <br> komachi ahead because Iroha is not an option. <br>This ship has the best taste.</br></br>  <br> EUrohafag <br> EU about to sleep <br>Irohafags are already established Murrikans which is why when Murikka is asleep there are more YYfags posting</br></br></br>  <br>A shitposter who defends labels on an anonymous board trying to collectively appeal to the board? Sounds about right.<br><br>I want summer to leave.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Humorously enough the exact opposite sentiment has been expressed plenty of times in these threads.<br><br>Irohafags complain that when their girl starts getting hated on, it means the Americans are waking up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I see that you still like Iroha, satan.</br>  <br>It's 8PM in the UTC+1 zone right now. If anyone's going to sleep it's sure as hell not the kind of people who spend there time in general threads on 4chan.</br>  <br>Nah. EU, AUS/Asia are Irohafags to the core.<br>The complaints about US waking up are mostly from Irohafags.</br></br>  <br>I'm in burgerland in the Iroha posts tend to pop up during the periods of 1 AM to like 5 AM in the morning. So I can conclude that you're full of shit anon.<br><br> Though I'm an Irohafag myself, but then again I hate living in America so that might have something to do with it. </br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't you ever lump me in Irohafags. I'll fight you bitch.<br><br>In my humble experience, Irohafags are at their most vile really late at night, like past midnight US CST. Then when I come home for lunch from work and check the thread around 11:30 AM or so there are always complaints about how Americans are waking up and Irohafags are getting shit on.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Snap, I forgot that Haruno exists. <br>Let's assume that she has one vote from that single Haruno-fag in these threads.</br></br>  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br>I'm in America too.<br>Have you seen the last thread. <br>It was YY for a good majority during the night.<br>There is no conclusive evidence that a majority of fans are in any one region.<br>But what I can say is that Iroha's legion is everywhere.</br></br></br></br></br>  No, seriously, the the heck is she doing  <br>Totsuka has already won the 8bowl</br>  I don't really think what continent you're from decides whether you're an Irohafag or not. I'm European and I can't stand Irohafags. Not because I'm European, but because they're obnoxious as fuck.  <br><br>Yeah it's not really about which region prefers which girl the most as much as where the loudest and most obnoxious posters come from for each girl. Which is basically random.<br><br>It seems like the worst most unhinged Irohafags are from the side of the globe opposite the US judging by their posting times. Other girls may have their most noxious supporters in the US or elsewhere. I noticed also in the last thread the pattern that has gone for weeks got broken to some extent. That may be a sign of people leaving the thread since it's gradually dying.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We love you too.</br>  <br>Flirting with the biggest alpha<br>8man is the backup because he isn't a big enough alpha</br></br>  <br>Yeah, nights used to be Iroha time, now it's day.(here in EST)<br>Weird how time flies.</br></br>  <br>Like the Yahari fanbase in general isn't obnoxious. Seriously, weren't you here when the Yuifags when on a week long retard session for that one episode? <br><br>Then there was the silly spoon threads from the Irohafags. <br><br>And Yukinofags are kind of self-explanatory. <br><br>Then the Sakifags suddenly got a pole shoved through their ass and started being assholes out of nowhere.<br><br>Basically what I'm saying is that there isn't a point in singling out just the Irohafags. The whole fanbase is cancerous when the anime season is here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Continent doesn't correlate with preference, but it does correlate to posting quality.<br><br>I've seen productive discussions in relation to every girl at night, most of them are going to naturally revolve around the club simply because Iroha has much less content to discuss.<br><br>Peak hours however are nothing but /v/-tier fanbase wars.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Irohatime is all day long</br>  <br>Yuifags aren't that bad, heck, I'd say that Yui, Sensei and Sakifags are probably the best.</br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.   reach this scene <br> Go to MAL and remove Yukino from my favorites <br><br>What have they done to her?</br></br></br>  This is the only reason why I'm still here. So maybe I can see the anon who made this again.  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br>You came to the realization that you've never actually understood Yukino.</br>  <br>it's just a joke</br>    Why does Iroha add so many -su to her words?  <br> MAL <br>opinion discarded</br></br>    <br>I'd say they were fine for the most part, but that one week they really took it to the newest low. My opinion of them really dropped after that. <br><br>Senseifags barely post anymore, but when they did after that bridge scene they acted extremely obnoxious despite the fact that was literally her only scene.<br><br>Sakifags used to just act depressed, but their recent posts have been kind of dickish and needlessly arrogant. Usually bashing the Irohafags for supporting an "irrelevant" character, obviously they are lacking a mirror in their households. <br><br>Irohafags for the most part just post fanart and gush about their girl. The only time they are really obnoxious are when they fall for the bait. Which happens really fucking often.<br><br>So personally I place Yuifags and Irohafags at the top, while the rest follow in varying degrees of overall shitty behavior.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now that's beta.</br>  <br>Yuifag have plenty of cancerous posters, the most known ones being the denialfag and the proxyfag.<br><br>Every fanbase is rotten, no exception.</br></br></br>  <br>いろはす～</br>  Can someone summarize these last threads?<br>I don't know how you can keep going, generals suck the fun out of everything.</br>  <br>The proxyfag isn't so much a cancer as a meme at this point. For one he was probably the one posting most of those polls, and for another he probably isn't even a Yuifag.<br><br>also<br> two examples <br> plenty </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw you will never go with Orimoto to Saize <br> tfwnf <br><br>Why live?</br></br></br></br>  <br> memes <br> shitposting <br> denialfags <br> Yui/Iroha fanart </br></br></br></br>  <br> the most known ones <br>Are you expecting me to know who is who at an anonymous board?</br></br>  <br>Same reason Yukino always adds -shira to her questions.</br>   arguing about which fanbases are more cancerous <br>do you faggots not see the irony?</br>  <br>Irohasu~</br>  <br>You forgot posting pan-san while the mods are asleep.</br>  Miss her already.  THK gave me PTSD with deredere fags, everytime I see a post shitting on another girl I can't help but think it's a yuifag behind the post  <br>I guess you could also count the fanfic/yandere guys.</br>  So for a retard like myself,what was the solution that Yui was talking about?  <br> what happened <br>Nothing. She was great then, and she is great now.<br><br>I just hope Yui or Iroha wins, because Yukino makes fun of 8man as much as Orimoto laughs at him. Taiwanese batman deserves better.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yui <br> deredere </br></br>  <br>Fanfic is only cancer if it gets spammed or you hate fun. I can't see the slightest thing wrong with Yandere Yui either unless you again fall into the "I hate fun" category.</br>  <br>I would post the analysis some anon wrote if I wasn't on mobile</br>  Komachi is a good girl. I don't have any romantic feelings for her but she soothes my soul.  How the fuck am I supposed to get invested in a love triangle when the end result feels so obvious?<br>At least it isn't as bad as your regular LN romance garbage where either every girl is a one-note crazy jealous bitch or the author takes a dump on everyone else with a chance's characterization to make them seem less appealing than Designated Main Girl, but actually being able to like the characters just makes the waiting for the inevitable feel even more pointless.<br>Why is it so difficult to write your story without giving in to the temptation to jerk off over your obvious favorite?</br></br>  <br>8man please stay.<br> Are you going for the friendship end? </br></br>  <br><br>Reminder that Yukimura won.<br><br>Anyone can win never give up hope.</br></br></br></br>  <br> MAL  <br><br>Don't you have some middle school homework to finish before mommy let's you shitpost on 4chan?</br></br></br>  <br>Sasuga Yukinofag.</br>  <br>Yukimura will be dropped pretty quickly in the last volume, sorry.<br>It's pretty obvious considering how the writer treat her</br></br>  I think we can all agree that Totsuka &gt; Komachi = Iroha &gt; Rumi &gt; Yui = Sensei &gt; Orimoto &gt; Saki &gt; Miura &gt; Ebina &gt; Yukino = Haruno  <br>Do you really think it's that obvious Yukino will win? I mean I've been a Yukinofag and I don't think she has a 100% chance of winning, in fact WW has even been writing it so Yui still has a good chance to win.<br><br>I can't tell if you're baiting or not.</br></br></br>  So which did you guys prefer?<br><br>S1 Edgelord hachiman or S2 dark and mysterious Hikky?</br></br>  <br><br>Yukimura turned into absolute shit after she "won"</br></br>  Why is Yukino so linkin park?  <br>Dark Accelerator</br>  <br>It's actually unrealistic that 8man is holding out in showing his preference for a girl, he would have made it a lot more obvious if one girl is actually winning.</br>  <br>I prefer the Senpai~! 8man</br>  <br>How can you put rumi ahead of Yui and Yukio behind and still be expected to be taken seriously?</br>  <br>What happened?</br>  <br> Commie </br>  <br>because of muh loli</br>  <br>S2 /fit/ delinquent Hachiman &gt; S1 memelord twink Hachiman</br>  <br>The end result isn't obvious at all. The exact problem with the love triangle is that the end isn't obvious. If 8man had a clear interest in one over the other things would actually interesting.<br><br>Well, the obvious end would be neither, but for most people the idea of a main heroine they like not getting a romantic end is unthinkable.</br></br></br>  <br>Best 8man is dere 8man.</br>  <br>What do you cool people use instead of MAL?</br>  <br><br>S2 Animation looked better to me</br></br>  These threads made me watch WA2. Finished it today.<br><br>Hold me, /a/.</br></br>  Not just Yukino, but 8man also got kinda defanged. Mind you, he's still a lot less autistic than her.  <br><br>They made him hotter as more girls got interested in him.<br><br>By the end of the series he'll be putting Hayato to shame.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Rumi is more like 8man than Yukino, and doesn't have massive amounts of baggage.<br><br>Stop equating physical appearance to character.</br></br></br>  <br>S2 8man looks like he can realistically have a harem of 9+/10 girls</br>  Soon?  <br>Did you play White Album 1 yet</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?t=15&amp;<wbr>v=N0YoUh0SjWc</wbr>  [ ] This song has so many memories, thank you for the nice times anons.<br>Where is my legion?</br>  <br>Yet. Rumi is definitely the representation of a younger Yukino and Hachiman. However, Hachiman saved her and gave her a second chance at a life without being bullied.</br>  <br>God I want to FUCK HER SO HARD.</br>  <br>Ye</br>  <br>This. 8man as he is right now is not only incapable of accepting any girls love besides totsuka and komachis, but unwilling to do so. His still-rotten personality that he's aware of makes it so any relationship he starts with the girls will likely blow up. Unless 8man goes through some personality changes his loner personality will undermine all his romantic relationships.</br>  <br>Feel's 8man is the sexiest male protagonist since Araragi.</br>  <br>Nothing.</br>  <br>I thought she was a representation of Yukino's and 8man's future daughter</br>  <br>Dude she's like 10 years old</br>  <br>It also doesn't help that, before Haruno kicked their collective asses with: "I thought you guys were better than this, is this truly genuine?", Hachiman was trying to be more like Hayato.</br>  <br>I'm here.</br>  <br>Age is just a number</br>  <br> eiii </br>  <br>Every time I see this I wonder how this came into existence. But I have to admit it's catchy.</br>   2 absolute knockouts are in love with 8man <br> he knows them well and he finds them important <br> they are friends so there won't be drama <br> he can't make a choice <br>This is somehow a bad thing? Dude is king.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Everywhere<br>Irohasu~</br></br>  <br>That also works, I guess.</br>  <br>I could hear her voice when I read that.</br>    <br>We put it in a notepad for future reference or if we want to remember an anima we watched, and we don't feel the need to put it on a public account to show the world how special snowflake our tastes are.</br>  <br> they are friends so there won't be drama  <br>That literally makes no sense</br></br>  <br>Normie please go.</br>  <br>Yukino was alone as a younger because she stood out so much it provoked jealousy.<br><br>Rumi's just a loner.</br></br></br>  <br>Anyone who wants a non irohasu end at this point has a confirmed shit taste.</br>  Hayato spin-off when?  <br><br>Besides the first girl flag she seems to rising all the others. I bet Iroha mastered all Tokimeki Memorial games.</br></br>  Rumi &gt; Yukinon &gt; Christmas Cake<br><br>It's her destiny</br></br>  <br>Is Araragi standing on a stepladder in that image?</br>  <br>You can't really call it winning when someone else is on his mind.</br>   yahallo!   <br>I don't get why anyone would compare Iroha to Yukimura when Chihiro is a much better comparison.</br>  <br>I didn't say they were the exact same people who lead the exact same lives and had the exact same reasons for being loners. I'm saying that Rumi represents what they had to go through in life, being bullied, albeit for different reasons.</br>    <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>Yahallo~!</br>  <br> Yo, sup </br>  <br>S1 Looks completely ugly compared to S2</br>  <br>They are friends so there won't be drama or heart break and the fallout that follows. Neither of the girls will truly hurt if the other one wins.</br>    <br>Isn't Araragi 5'5 and Hachiman 5'8?</br>  Who will win the TOBE?  <br>The nature of the bullying is completely opposite though. It's like relating Yukino to Saki because they both have family troubles.</br>  <br>Hikitani is 5'8? Damn, and he looked tall as fuck in the series.</br>  <br>Yeah, chihiro suits her better.<br>There was one interesting post that made some nice comparisons between Iroha and chihiro and Iroha and Taiga but it will take too long to find it on mobile.</br></br>  <br>So neither will be hurt when the guy they've liked for over a year ends up with their best friend? That shit tears relationships apart and I don't think you've had enough human interaction to understand that</br>  <br><br>I know Arararagi is a manlet but don't know about 8man.</br></br>  <br>That was pretty much my point, Araragi's a manlet.<br><br>The image is reminiscent of that time he tried to appear taller than Hitagi by standing in the foreground.</br></br></br>  <br>Compared to japanese people<br><br>Note, their average height is 5'7</br></br></br>  <br>Irohasu</br>  <br>does that mean that the cunt and tobe are also short?</br>  Why do I even watch this.<br>Every 5 seconds they stop talking and say embarassing shit to each other literally confessing to each other without them knowing with all these autistic physical signs.<br>Doesn't help that the characters all speak in 2deep4me shit.<br>I had no idea what the fuck was going on in the last 10 mins.</br></br></br>  <br>Volume 11 proves that at 'happen. They will play nice and fair, one will win and the other will stay friends with them with no drama or pain. <br><br>Yui won't be destroyed by 8man rejection her<br>Yukino won't be destroyed by 8man rejection her</br></br></br></br>  <br>Learn from some of us, watch it for her.</br>  <br>Irohafag trying to hide his power level.</br>  <br>Don't know, don't think so, since girls fall head over heels for Hayato</br>  <br>yeah I didn't even watch the last episode because she didn't show up</br>  <br><br>I think vol 11 suggested they will reach that point. But there will be plenty of drama on the way.</br></br>  <br>So, like /a/?</br>  <br>He's on the second floor</br>  <br>I meant to say it won't happen.</br>  Once Yukino and Yui realize the love between Hayama and Hikigaya they will both quit because they know they can't interfere with true love. Look gay is in Hikigaya's name. IT'S A MUST GAY.  Okay so Hikki is prone to get jealous when things involve Yukinon, but does Yukinon get jealous when things are about Hikki?  <br> get the 8, making it so that Yukino doesn't have to deal with what she's feeling <br>She did this to force Yukino to confess her feelings however, and make a change in the status-quo.</br></br>  Komachi is so ahead on that poll that now we know who is favored by Irohafags after their goddess.  <br> But there will be plenty of drama on the way. <br>I don't buy it. This amount of drama just to acknowledge everyone's feelings means there will be less once the girls start going for what they want. The only way there will be drama is if 8man is a wishy washy faggot that can't stop leading them both on.</br></br>  <br>you are dumb as fuck</br>  <br>Perhaps.</br>  So I just finished it, I can't believe that's how they ended the episode like what the flying fuck.<br><br>Yui saying ayylmao why dont we all be real and expose our feeling<br>Then it just devolves into hey let's like Yuki help herself and make this facade last forever.<br><br>Not to mention the fish metaphors that made me want to fucking kill myself, like did the writers think they were clever?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dude I 100% share the same sentiments holy fuck to the T bro.</br>  Yui: Hey let's a have contest. First one to get pregnant by Hikki gets to keep him.<br>Yukino: I...uh...<br>Hachiman: Do it.<br>Yukino: ok...<br><br>There all we have to do is apply H-logic to everything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The big problem is that Chihiro is only parallel on a superficial level. Chihiro won because Keima's feelings for her were so much deeper than the other girls- Iroha is in the exact opposite situation.</br>  <br>There's also some similarities to Shinobu, though not as blatant as the Taiga/Chihiro ones<br> Latecomer of sorts (Shinobu was just a plot device without a single line of dialogue in the first volume) <br> Becomes a major player in the story, is often the protagonist's partner when it comes to work <br> Loads of chemistry and barely-restrained sexual tension <br> Teasing/Flirtatious personality, often has morally questionable motives <br> &gt;Unequivocal best girl <br> Both are associated with 'fakeness" (in Monogatari, supernatural beings are thematically "fake") <br> Both are made "real" by the protagonist (Iroha hearing the genuine speech, Shinobu being turned into a psuedo-human) <br><br>That said Iroha can't quite stand up to the real goddess.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  BD sales are at 12000 if any of you care to know.  <br> Yui: Hey let's a have contest. First one to get pregnant by Hikki gets to keep him. <br>It's over.</br></br>  <br>There's no evidence of that. 8man's relationship with the others are superficial as fuck, and he hasn't acknowledged his feelings for Iroha.</br>  <br>SEASON 3 CONFIRMED</br>  <br>We're past 10k already? Impressive.</br>  <br>Date OVA confirmed</br>  <br> mywaifu4laifu </br>  <br>8man has as much as said that he's willing to go through hell to be a part of YY's lives.<br><br>He might feel the same way about Iroha but it's silly to try to draw that conclusion because like you said we haven't seen an indicator of it yet.</br></br></br>  <br> 8man's relationship with the others are superficial as fuck <br>Which is why he took action to go against that, not to mention he actually takes time to get to know YY more than anyone.</br></br>  <br> That said Iroha can't quite stand up to the real goddess. <br>No, get out.</br></br>  COMA CHEESE OR DEATH  <br>Exactly why the arguments for Iroha stop at "they're superficial." The rest of the story is too damning for her case.<br><br>"They're superficial, but they know it, they hate it, and they want to be better"</br></br></br>  Dead thread<br>Dead series<br>Dead fanbase</br></br>  <br>COMA</br>  <br> 8man has as much as said that he's willing to go through hell to be a part of YY's lives. <br> YY's <br>And there you have it. 8man obviously isn't in love with them both, so you can't claim that hey any significant romantic lead on Iroha.

The end is drawing closer.  <br> Tamanawa reacting <br>I approve</br></br>  <br><br>But she is very fake, like all the time. She openly admits it too.</br></br>  <br><br>Soon it will all come together.</br></br>  <br> Yukino <br> genuine </br></br>  <br>Indeed. It is inevitable.</br>  <br>But she is genuine  to him. </br>  Wow I can't believe people could possibly still like Yukino after we got to see Orimoto and Iroha. I can understand still liking Yui, but those two girls are just leagues above.  <br>I want them to fuck like wild beasts in front of Yukino and Hayama.</br>  <br>Here's your reply, anon.</br>  <br><br>I fail to see that. Orimoto is nothing but HILARIOUS and Iroha is a manipulative bitch that only someone with no self respect would like.</br></br>  <br> Iroha be Seitokaicho you can act all foxxy to Hayama about it <br> great idea! <br><br>You are blind son.</br></br></br></br>  Can someone explain to me why Yukino told Hachiman he didn't understood anything after he solved the StuCo fiasco? What did she really want?  <br>If this is what Watari is going for, Iroha's probably getting rejected next volume.<br> Iroha confesses to 8man, like we're all expecting <br> 8man rejects her, because "not genuine" <br> may get ugly depending on how 8man goes about it <br> 8man is extremely troubled afterward, can't put his finger on why <br> Hayama probably punches him <br> things start going downhill with the club <br> Yui and Yukino realize 8man's caught IROHA OR DEATH and he has no Iroha <br> are forced to settle their differences and let go of 8man <br> 8man may or may not reconcile with Iroha in the end, depending on if Watari wants a bittersweet ending </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>  What did she really want? <br><br>To be student council president. He didn't know that, thinking she was just doing that to fulfill the request. Although Haruno gave him a hint he didn't pick up on.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't we all?</br>  <br> pre-genuine Iroha <br>Here's your reply.</br></br>  <br> iroha <br> calculative <br> confessing <br>Nah, Yui is the one confessing if anything.<br>Iroha wouldn't pull that unless all the cards were in her favor.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I do not know Hachiman's exact height and that was my baseless assumption using FEEL's Hachiman as a reference.<br><br>In episode two of Oregairu Zoku; Hachiman is taller than Kawasaki, which is impossible, Kawasaki in the light novels is an Amazonian and is taller than her peers. Either, Hachiman hit a growth spurt or that is how Index/Railgun designer draw his male characters. Unless, Kawasaki was lowering her knees because she was scared, I'll have to rewatch the episode.<br><br>I honestly believe Hachiman is around Araragi height, if not slightly taller by a small margin.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I thought Iroha was a fake girl <br> and she was <br> hah, take that Sensei, who is delusional now! </br></br></br>  <br>Unfortunately, not everyone has seen the light. Keep spreading the good word, anon.</br>  <br>She won't confess until she know for sure that he will accept her. She confessed to Hayama just to destroy him as false target.</br>  <br><br><br>Why is this old hag constantly hanging around highschoolers again?</br></br></br>  Do you think Haruno is still chaste?  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>Out of the ~3 scenes Iroha had last volume, one of them was her confirming 8man's feelings for her.<br><br>There's no way she wasn't setting up for a confession, especially considering she disappeared for the rest of the volume immediately afterward.</br></br></br>  I swear, If Iroha don't win I'm going to japan to commit mass suicide in front of WW house to send a strong message.  <br>Cool, but you should probably start by killing yourself first at home and then proceed to do those other things.</br>  <br>The only thing that she confirmed is that 8man admits being open to her advances now.<br>She's not stupid, she knows about the double YY and dislikes having to compete with them. She won't confess unless she receives a definite green flag from 8man.<br>But I do agree that WW is setting something up with her disappearance in volume 11 after those scenes.</br></br></br>  <br>All part of the plan.<br><br><br> suicide <br> able to send a message <br> in Japan <br>I am afraid you didn't think your cunning plan quite through.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's the "mass" part that's important here.</br>  <br> All part of the plan. <br><br>what plan?</br></br></br>  <br> mass suicide <br> 1 person <br><br>How does that work?</br></br></br></br>  <br>2nd best girl is so far ahead that it seems unfair.</br>  <br> suicide <br> WW decides to change the ending and Iroha wins <br> you will never see that ending because u ded </br></br></br>  <br> Making her sister strong enough to stand on her own by NTRing her. </br>  <br>Not him but it's worth it if it's for our queen and goddess.</br>  <br>Iroha isn't that calculating, she said she let herself get caught up in the mood when she asked Hayama, and was clearly an emotional wreck afterward.<br><br>The confession was specifically the result of her dropping her calculations.<br><br>Speaking of which<br> Iroha says she was "caught up in the mood" when she confessed to Hayama <br> Her feelings weren't for Hayama <br> 8man says he "took in the mood" immediately before asking Yui out <br><br>Also<br> pic related <br><br>Watari's actually foreshadowed this pretty hard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She wants the 8 inch.</br>  <br>top quality humor</br>  <br>Just like she received a definite green flag from Hayama right?<br><br>8man's the reason she wants genuine in the first place. If she realizes she likes him and is emotionally capable, she'll go for him.</br></br></br>  <br> making 8man used goods in front of her <br>I'm not even an NTRfag but my dick</br></br>  <br>The only reason she threw her calculations away was because she overheard 8man's genuine speech.<br>It's not happening again now that she got her head straight.</br></br>  I don't think Haruno really views Hachiman as anything other than a toy for her amusement right now. An interesting toy, more so than her other one Hayato but a toy nevertheless.<br><br>Now if Hachiman ends up helping Yukino with her issues and even more importantly helping Haruno/Yukino repair their relationship and become close again, that'll melt her panties harder than any GENUINE speech can.</br></br>  <br>That background though</br>  <br>See </br>  <br><br>Would this really make her a stronger person, do you think?I wonder how Yukino would really react to Hachiman fucking her own sister.<br><br>I'll put my faith in Haruno anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't make sense. Iroha told 8man after getting rejected that she wants something genuine. There's no indication she'd just stop caring for no reason.</br>  <br>Go for it. That way it'll just be the sensible Irohafags left, and YYfags can look forward to being greeted to post-series threads with a warm "Iroha~su" without having to worry about your bitching and whining.</br>   Feeling like shit because no more anime <br> Starts listening to the OST <br> Feels even worse <br> Suddenly "Iroha" OST is played <br> Life is a lot better now </br></br></br></br>  <br>Things must be broken before they can be rebuild. I understand it is hard to have faith, but I am proud of you for having it anyway.</br>  <br>I think that's how she saw him before, but at this point <br>she at least sees him as a peer now. She wouldn't bet everything on him fixing Yukino and push him this hard if that wasn't the case.</br></br>  <br>Are there any good Iroha reaction images?</br>  <br><br>Don't be stupid<br><br>If she wanted that all she'd have to do is put his dick in her mouth</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yukino can still win the 8bowl but know that he's fucking her sister on the side</br>  <br>How would a dere Haruno look like?</br>  Please read the guide before asking questions<br><br>http://buyfag.moe</br></br>  <br>Who's the character?

This item right here: https://order.mandarake.co.jp/order<wbr>/detailPage/item?itemCode=101473369<wbr>3<br><br>Contacted them to ask what the stain was. Asides from someone possibly jacking off on her, they reduced the price by about 4k just for this (pic related). <br><br>I love mandarake.</br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br>I just got dandy a month ago after stating that maybe I'll wait till christmas to get him to communal jeers from everyone here.

Can you also ask them to store your item even if you're not planning on combining it with anything? <br><br>I don't want my package to arrive at an empty house.</br></br></br>  <br> Over a year <br>Seriously?</br></br>  <br>I haven't had a single item (monthly orders) from Amico get stuck in customs this year. I really like it!</br>  <br><br>Will probably become more frequent now that mandarake doesn't undervalue per default anymore</br></br>  <br>Are they planning on starting to accept pre orders for the 5th anniversary figs on the characters birthday with the rest of them?<br><br>Does this mean I'll have to wait until January for Mio?</br></br></br>    <br>I think so. I missed the pre-order but I think I found her on a random site I'd never heard of in Europe and preordered there... I think it was German so I have no idea if I did it right</br>  <br>Anon please you're making me feel more guilty for not dusting my madokami this week.</br>  What other hobbies/interests do you guys have? Do they cost as much or more than your plastic?  <br><br>I expected noticeable fading or a big scuff mark or something. That can probably be removed with warm water and a q-tip.<br>Kinda sucks about the box though. It's not terrible damage, but I'm one of those people who likes to keep the boxes as nice-looking as possible.</br></br></br>  <br>fuck off</br>  5th anniversary K-On! Yui when? I already paid the Azusa one for a fucking huge price, so when can I throw more money at them?  <br>I'm not sold.</br>  <br>Go to MFC and make a blog post with that question.</br>  <br>I now that according to the illustration she's supposed to look like this, but Why the fuck they didn't include at least a cast-off miniskirt?, I bet they would sell even more in that way.</br>  <br>Because they are supposed to be in a lingerie.</br>  <br>I would have bought the entire set, if they wore wedding dresses, which were cast off able, like in the book 's cover(s).</br>  <br>Read what I wrote, please.<br><br><br>Yes, that's how I feel about them, it's a pity since they look beautiful, but as I said if only they had included at least a mini-skirt.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Read what I wrote, please. <br>Doesn't change the fact that it would look out of place with a lingerie corset.</br></br>  <br><br>Doesn't change the fact that the white transparent "wedding dress" they are covered with in the cover of the book looks like shit and was made only so it didn't look that lewd.</br></br>  <br>And it would look even more shit in plastic form.</br>  <br>Looks as if they're wrapped with bubble wrap</br>  What's a safe temperature for figs? My room has no ac and good way to cool it and during the middle of the day it gets really hot and I'm worried about my fig  <br>well, if it gets too damn hot, the coloring would probably melt away. But it's just my baseless claim. As cool as possible seems like a safe bet though</br>  <br>Is it humid?<br>I don't think dry heat is as bad as nasty humif heat.<br>Get an ac or something in there, you shouldn't be collecting figures if you have no means of maintaining them.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Define hot. <br><br>Here where I live I'm at 35°C right now, it can go up to 40°C some days yet my figures are perfectly fine. No AC either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>About the same.</br>  I got my Olivia release yesterday, and am just trying to put her together now. I've got everything sorted, except her head. I'm really panicking when I try to get the hair over the wings, it really doesn't seem like it should fit. I'm trying to go between the biggest gap, but the peg on the neck just won't go into the slot.<br><br>Any tips out there?</br></br>  <br>Just j-jam it in.</br>  <br>Apply more pressure.</br>  <br>Thanks doc</br>  <br><br>Fuck, it went in, but it isn't a good feeling.<br>Looks fine though, cheers boys.</br></br></br>  <br>Glad it turned out fine pal.</br>  Got bunny girl Chris black edition in the mail this morning. Very happy with her, the promotion pictures don't do her justice.  <br>Care to share a pic? I just got white in the mail and my black one hasn't gotten here yet. I need to see it.</br>  <br>Shit photo incoming, only camera I have is on my phone unfortunately.</br>  <br>Thanks. I'm ready to finally have all three lined up.</br>  <br>Perfection. Fuck why is release so far away.</br>  <br>I need to buy this, you know, just for shit ands and giggles.</br>  At what point did you realize you were fully committed to PVC?  <br><br>when i ordered my second Deltof and had to completely re-arrange my room based on figures.</br></br>  Why are there no fucking figures from this goddamn show what the fuck i just want one to exist and they don't fucking exist and its fucking terrilbe shit fuck damnit  <br>At hat point did you realize that you're a fucking faggot?</br>  <br>For dramatic effect.</br>  <br>It's seems like BiJ is getting progressively shitter. Just a year ago many people preferred them to Amico. Then it became "only use them for exclusives because at least they're better than N-Y", and now they're just straight up worse than N-Y.</br>  <br>dragon penis.</br>   have a friend who's poor with no job <br> he keeps ordering figures <br><br>Why</br></br></br>  <br> have a friend </br>  <br>Addiction, son.<br>People get credit cards and shit to buy figures with no way to pay them off. <br>(Near) Instant gratification while putting off the 'pain' of spending money indefinitely.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He needs figures to help him cope with the fact that he's jobless and poor.</br></br>  <br>No, he can't be serious. She came out this May. Still, that's a pretty long time in customs.</br>  <br> posting about my life choices online <br>I am no longer your friend and you are dead to me.</br></br>  <br>Its even better when you can own them forever.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>   Preorders are closed on most sites and I really want that figure <br><br> Wait for the release date, there’s a good chance you can grab it at the big 3 without spending copious amounts in other sites. <br><br>So does anyone think I still have a chance to grab this figure on the release date or will I have to get it preowned?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's funny, there are so many people on MFC that want her now, when just 2 months ago everyone was giving up POs.</br>  <br> Exclusive <br> At the big 3 <br><br>haha</br></br></br></br>  Man, I like this. And she doesn't even have those terrible PAK double joints.  Does anyone have GSC Kurisu? Looks nice but the prices now look a little hefty.  <br>which one?</br>  <br>i wish i had this image when i was still in the army.</br>  <br><br>I must have worded it wrong, i meant that i didn't have to pay customs for longer than a year, not that the figure was stuck for the duration of one year</br></br>  <br>I'm praying for a rerelease once 0 airs. She doesn't look too impressive, she's just popular.</br>  <br><br>She honestly looks quite impressive. <br>And I wouldn't hold my breath over a re-release, just look at their Tohsaka Rin UBW scale, she and that scale are immensely more popular that Kurise yet they didn't re-release it.</br></br></br>  <br>I have the white coat ver., it's great.<br>It looks good next to Alter Suzuha.<br>Unfortunately I paid a scalper's price for both.<br>Like ~136 shipped for Suzuha and like ~160 shipped for Makise.</br></br></br></br>  <br> when just 2 months ago everyone was giving up POs. <br>Why would you give up your preorder so early?</br></br>  <br>I like the regular version better. The face on the white coat one is a bit off, at least in pictures.<br><br><br>Because people on MFC are fucking dumb.</br></br></br></br>  <br>UBW already got one rerelease, only Koto does multiple rereleases. The only one I can think of right now that got 3 was Saber Distant Avalon.</br>  You ready for BROCK?  <br>She's supposed to look a bit embarrassed, as opposed to angry.<br>I can see the preference for the standard release, I sort of wish I had it but I can't really justify spending that much when I already have the exclusive version.</br></br>  <br>No. I'm ready for Misty.</br>  <br>Erica when?</br>  Has anyone ordered from sukipan.com before?<br><br>They're a MFC partner, but I just want to be certain before I buy from them.</br></br>  <br>Sabrina when?</br>  <br>That hardly counts as it was "re-released" only 4 and a half months after the original release. I know is technically a re-release, but is totally not the same as doing it years later.</br>  <br><br>Haven't touched it since it's a euro site</br></br>  What do you think happened in the Ireneverse? <br><br>do you think we'll ever see it again?<br><br>http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87</br></br></br></br>  <br>I really, really never wanted to remember my days spent in that cesspool  as a trip. </br>  <br> Atsuko Tanaka's sweet womanly voice will be used again </br>  <br>He can't keep getting away with it</br>  <br>Mesos were the norm until Part 3 when ectos started coming in.

Requesting colors for these pictures of Sailor Venus and Mars, please.<br><br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/index.<wbr>php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=48328<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/index.<wbr>php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=48329</wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  So is Kusuriruriruriri actually a grill<br><br>I ask because I've never seen a female artist go ham on tits like that.</br></br>  Simple request:<br><br>Can a drawfriend please draw Fujiko (from Lupin III) doing something super domestic - like making a sandwich while wearing a tiny apron, or maybe carrying a laundry basket?<br><br>Thanks</br></br></br></br>  Requesting Sandalphon (left) playing with plushies of the Gunbuster bugs (right)  Requesting cute girls with cute huge penises  Requesting Tomoko taking another lewd selfie showing off her tan lines, but still covering her fun parts.   2nd July is a UFO Day <br>Draw Erio, or your waifu as an alien.</br>  Requesting Eto in her bandages, up top of the roofs, lurks and viewing tokyo city in the mid night.

Coloring is not needed, but if you can add shadows it would be appreciated.<br><br>Thank you in advance.</br></br>  Requesting Kohaku, from Tsukihime, unleashing Ea. Thank you.  <br>That's really nice, thanks a lot drawfriend.</br>  how much would you charge someone for a sketch?  <br>I know panties drew the one on the left. Who drew the one on the right?</br>  <br>I wouldn't bother<br><br>If I was forced to charge, 5 bucks would be reasonable for one character and no background</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think he went by any name.</br>  Requesting Kafuka as a stand for any of the Zetsubous. Bonus points for Araki style  <br>A shitty sketch then.

I'm not legoman<br><br>2. Our definition of sketch may vary. Legoman's stuff isn't sketches. They're basically finished lineart. For which I would charge $30 or $40, because that's more than half the work for me.</br></br></br>  <br>What I meant is that a "sketch" is pretty vague. On the other hand it seems like I misinterpreted what you meant, thought you were a commissionner who wouldn't pay more than 5 bucks for a sketch, not a drawer making commissions.</br>  <br><br>Oh they did. I remember now. Was just on the tip of my tongue.</br></br>  <br>Found it in the archive, it's Null.</br>  Requesting Sawyer wearing a pretty dress like this one:<br>http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=2736784<br><br>No shoes.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Hey, I was there just a few days ago!</br>  <br>Requesting cute lolis with cute micro penises</br>  Requesting Ryona getting her body smashed into a wall please, as in being pushed into it with a great amount of force. something like this:<br><br>http://uploads.dragonballencycloped<wbr>ia.com/0/00/Goku_Smashed_Into_Wall.<wbr>jpg</wbr></wbr></br></br>  Requesting Hori and Miyamura having cute, yet awkward first-time sex or more of Miyamura 'abusing' or treating Hori roughly because she likes it.

A sundress would be cool too, but its not necessary.  <br>  expensive <br><br>I bought mine for like 50-60 euros and it still works totally fine after two years.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Would you rather waste time, and ultimately your life than scrap paper?</br></br>  <br>Luj mIw vISovbe'.</br>   []sniff lolibutt   <br>It's rare or non-existent at the moment.</br>    <br>draw my waifu pls</br>  <br>You should get a proper sized and quality tablet.</br>  <br>It's not like I wanted to actually sleep tonight or anything.</br>   less than 24 hours <br><br>OH SAY CAN YOU SEE</br></br>  <br>less than 24 hours till we celebrate the glorious nation of China?</br>  Requesting shion brushing tama's hair  <br>No, the one I have is far good enough. If anything I tried bigger tablets and I find them way less comfortable than my A5 sized one. If I wanted to change with an expensive one that would be getting a huge tablet with screen.</br>  <br> not wacom </br>  <br>Look outside. Does it look like October?<br><br>If niggas want some qipaos or commie scum bikinis then, I will provide. Tomorrow is freedom, however.</br></br></br>  <br>I just picked a random image with a screen tablet, I'm not using this one neither I want it.</br>  <br> Giving shit advice <br><br>They are known for poor customer supports and drivers problems.</br></br></br>  <br>was he giving advice?</br>  <br>I think he meant to quote </br>  Requesting fusion of Arata Demon Lord Form, Issei Balence Breaker and Tatsumi Incursio.  <br>You're awesome, JADF, I don't really care if you draw for the drawthreads or whatever, as long as you still draw and have fun doing so.</br>  <br> not using autism bucks to buy a cheap, 60 dollar beginner tablet. </br>  Requesting Akira from Yamato 2199 taking it right up the ass.  <br> thinking you need a tablet to be a drawfag <br>just draw on old napkins and papers.</br></br>  wifu?  <br>If you can't draw with a mouse then practice more on paper because you don't deserve a tablet. It's just drawing without the pressure sensitivity.</br>  <br>to be fair its quite a bit harder and puts a lot more strain on your wrist.</br>  Are there any good drawfags who don't use tablet?  <br>There are no good drawfags.</br>  <br>except me</br>  <br>Soon.</br>  <br>Zeima comes immediately to mind. There are others, too.</br>  <br>code and ssf are the best drawfags and they only do traditional</br>  <br><br>Laughing Lunar as a Nereid for the purpose of Funposting. Just added a new skin tone, ears, and one horn.<br><br>Only got an hour or so before I got to go be a normal fag for the weekend. Anyone else have any reaction images for a MG edit?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really. Keep the wrist rigid and do lines from the elbow. I didn't repetitive strain injury myself until 2 years after I got a tablet, but I was mousing for 5 years prior.</br>  <br>draw a girl getting horsed</br>  <br>well its one of those things I can manage with, but I'll always suggest traditional over using a mouse unless you're just really used to working with a mouse.</br>  which girls would look better with gags?  <br>You.</br>  <br>the ones with the worst voices</br>    <br>Who?</br>  <br>lolis</br>  Now that the footfags are dead, can we start persecuting the gagfags?  <br>Who? Better be a non-shitposter choice.</br>  <br>No time today. Both or just the girl on top? Ideas for the mamono(s)?</br>  <br>My vote goes to Miku</br>  <br>Ur mum</br>  <br>thats been done before</br>  <br>Okay then Kuroko from index</br>  <br>I like feet</br>  <br> Both or just the girl on top? <br>I guess it's up to you, but both would be funnier. Ushi-oni for Illya and kikimora for Miyu is the most obvious choice.</br></br>  <br>Source?</br>  <br> want my waifu drawn by Jadf <br> about to reply but I saw horsed </br></br>  <br> what JADF did to my waifu can never be undone <br> JADF will never draw something good of my waifu </br></br>  What happened to Navelfag?  <br> never expect JADF to draw my waifu <br> he does <br> it's not even sexual, he just gave her giant tits <br><br>It was really nice of him to draw her, but I couldn't help but feel a little underwhelmed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably moved on to being the futafag</br>  Someone requested this   <br>I think all that Oorahimeshit really turned him away from here</br>  I hate it.  Whenever I see the letters JADF I can only think of japanese air defense force. That's not real is it?  <br>Probably will give this a try when I get back in a few days. Fits the Monster girl theme pretty well.</br>  I don't know what to request.  <br>If you see three or more people requesting the same thing, go with that.</br>  <br>Since when has oorahime been relevant? That meme is so 2014.</br>  <br>And run the risk of being called a haremfag?<br>No fucking thanks.</br></br>  <br>He has been posting significantly less since then</br>  <br>Bandwagoning is one of the best ways to guarantee a delivery, though.<br>But if you'd rather have integrity, that's fine by me.</br></br>  <br>If that shit was bad enough to drive JADF from us then he could apologize to those waifufags.</br>  <br> riding off the coat-tails of someone else's request <br>scum</br></br>  <br>JSDF Gate has a scene where they battle a dragon and it causes havoc to the Village Dark Elves, right?<br><br>JADF should draw one of the girls under Itami or the Dark Elf taking the Dragon's D.</br></br></br>  <br>Ayy</br>  <br> That long finger. <br>Naisu.</br></br>  <br>Deliverin'<br>Well, it's done. I hope you like it!</br></br>  Don't let your dreams be dreams! Push forward<br>Ganbatte newfriends</br>    <br>I don't plan on doing it, but you have to admit that it works out for a lot of requesters.</br>  <br>cute</br>  <br>Oh god, that's just adorable. Thanks for the hard work, anon!</br>  <br>Epic win</br>  <br>It doesnt make those requesters any less of faggots though</br>  Requesting Miia as an Apophis.<br>http://i.imgur.com/EpnOhb3.jpg</br>  requesting monster girls made into normal human girls   less than 24 hours remain <br>Will hakase or 34 or kuso give me a painting this week?</br>  <br>Code.</br>  <br>Unlikely</br>  <br>Are you their friend?<br><br>Guess not.</br></br></br>  <br>I can't wait for him to paint ryou again. The butthurt is always so delicious.</br>  <br>Not unless you are part of the circle or another drawfag.</br>  <br> tfw genuinely appreciate his paintings of my waifu <br>I dont know what his problem is. He even painted my waifu as a toilet</br></br>  How do I prove that I really love her? I tried the waifu threads but I didn't feel like I'd fit in.  <br>by not posting in these threads</br>  Requesting an image of Misaka patrolling the wastes with an armored vault jumpsuit and a Gauss rifle.  <br>Send her flowers.</br>  Spoilers on the horizon.  <br>I love you Anniebot</br>  <br>Looks like Splortfujos strike again.</br>  <br>Anniebot is kill</br>  <br>;_;</br>  <br>Splorty is so deep and complex</br>  <br>for you</br>  https://twitter.com/ShingekiKyojin/<wbr>status/616653992848834560<br>Isayama gave an interview that will be published in Weekly Shonen Magasine on August 5th</br></wbr>  <br>At least it's better than another EM OP.</br>  What are the chances of BR and MT appearing again this chapter? What are the chances of Annie appearing?  <br> What are the chances of BR and MT appearing again this chapter? <br>1%<br> What are the chances of Annie appearing? <br>0%<br>You know Isayama.</br></br></br></br></br>  Bert is love.<br>Bert life.</br>  <br>He really is.</br>  <br>Bert a cute.</br>  <br>Let's make this a Bert thread.</br>  Can we all agree that Armin is best shingeki?  <br>Nope, Bert is.</br>  <br>Cant wait for this Interview but I bet most of the questions are going to be about the movie</br>  <br>How dare you. My Hisubong is far more complex and deep than your Berty.</br>  <br>Sure, if you want to reverse shitpost that hard.</br>  Bert is Love <br>Bert is Life<br>Bert dick is so big that it will take all the women of Humanity to lick it fully<br>Bert may have done wrong but his quietness makes us all cum</br></br></br>  <br>Does it mention anything on what the interview will be about? Just "an interview" is really vague</br>  <br>Stop being so lewd.</br>  <br>Probably about the live action movie. Haruma Miura (Eren's actor) also participated to the interview.</br>  <br>And also Kanata Hongo (Armin's actor)</br>  <br>I hope one question will be why Eren is out of character <br><br>But anon Bert is so Lewd that it made Annie emotionless</br></br></br>  Why are Ymirfags so butthurt ITT?  <br> why Eren is out of character <br>In the movie? Well they are not totally following the manga, they probably decided to change his character too.</br></br>  <br>I hope someone ask Isayama how he came up with such a deep and interesting character like Bertl. Did it take him long to think up a man of this complexity?</br>  <br>Reminder that EHfags are our enemies.</br>  <br>Do they need a reason? It's always like that.</br>  <br>Their reverse shitposting is so obvious.</br>  <br>What else is new.</br>  <br>I know Bert so interesting that one day he will take over the role of the main character <br><br><br>Stop baiting the EH fags you shitposter they are usually fine unless we talk about EH<br>dont you know this is a bert thread now piss of</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Buttblunted EHfag.</br>  <br>Living in your mother's basement shitposterfag</br>  <br> I know Bert so interesting that one day he will take over the role of the main character <br>This much is obvious. Only then will people appreciate his subtle complexity and understand why Reiner is so in love with him.</br></br>  Ymir is worst shingeki  <br>And water is wet.</br>  <br>There is nothing wrong about girls like me to live with parents. Everyone knows that we EM/YH shippers are 110% female.</br>  <br>This.</br>  Meanwhile in France.  <br>Is this about that board game from yesterday?</br>  <br>This comment makes so much sense and love for bert that it made my eyes tear</br>  <br>Blort a shit.</br>  <br>L'ATTAQUE DES TITANS</br>  <br>What's going on here?</br>  <br>typical Ymirfag response.</br>  <br>Does it make your fan girl heart flutter?</br>  <br>Shitmir is just as bad as Splorty.</br>  <br>No. That's the oculus rift attraction.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Dhv<wbr>CQVnABWs</wbr>  [ ]<br>It was showed first during Kyojinten.<br><br>The board game is a game in which you have to kill a titan. There are at least two soldiers and one titan, up to five players. The body of the titan is the board itself. That's the only things that have been revealed so far.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HOW DARE YOU INSULT BERT YOU SHALL FEEL THE WRATH OF THE MOST POWERFUL TITAN EVER</br>  <br>Yes, yes it does</br>  <br>Is that a censored penis?</br>  Annie is love<br>Annie is life<br>Annie means the world  to me <br>Annie a miracle of the universe<br>Annie might've done some things wrong, but she's still a beautiful person inside and out</br></br></br></br>  Reinerfag is on a spree today. Don't forget to take your pills bro.  <br>You obviously don't understand deep and dynamic characters. Don't you dare lump shitmir with my interesting and complex Berty.</br>  <br>Islamshit leave</br>  http://imgur.com/a/nxLCg  Does Isayama get off on height differences?  <br>We don't deserve anyone sharing this stuff with us, just look at the thread. Thank you anyway.</br>  <br>Haha, this is so funny!</br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br>This is so hilarious. Why is Berty so perfect?</br>  <br>Anniebot you to late this thread been converted into a Bert thread</br>  <br><br><br><br> these guys are actually serious </br></br></br></br>  <br>It is what you want it to be.</br>  Why does Bort have so many characterfags when he's boring wallpaper? Literally every single other character has more personality.  Historia Targaryen Reiss is the most complex character because sometimes she's sad. She's so deep even though she's a small person and also a secret mastermind but fools everyone into thinking she's just an ehtard. Historia is BRA's true boss and created Ymir and the Ackerman family. Her vorpal eh's will defeat MT and she will resolve world hunger.  <br> Bertfags are this butthurt </br>  <br>You're confusing an assblasted shitposter with actual Bertfags. Bert has three fags here at most. I doubt if it's even that many.</br>  <br>Fuck off Ymirshitter, you don't understand subtle beauty.</br>  <br>Sure.</br>  <br>The reverse shitposting is too obvious.</br>  Why are Bertfags hating on Ymirfag? I thought Tumblr was supposed to be accepting of pre-op transgender neckbeards.  <br>I don;t think it's shitposting. It's what Bertfags always say anyways.</br>  <br>This is 100% true. Historia &gt; Bert</br>  When are humanity going to invent Tanks, I mean<br>they already invented canons and wheels.</br>  <br>Sure thing, that's why no one gives a fuck to talk about him in a non sarcastic manner.</br>  Reminder that Historia is best shingeki and that she deserves to be with the man she loves.  <br>Reiner Pls</br>  <br>Somebody need their pills</br>  <br> the man she loves <br> Reiner <br>Pigner please.</br></br></br>  <br>Reiner is a dead man.</br>  <br>But she was worried that she might lose her first man<br>that joined her Harem when eren was serious about killing him</br></br>  <br>Historia was clearly worried about her husbando Eren, that he'd have to get his hands dirty.</br>  No other shingeki comes close to the greatness that is Historia. She should be elected president of the United States because of how amazing she is. Every night I cry knowing I love a unique character who is so well written and engaging. Not only that but she's bisexual so it covers all the bases and makes her more relatable to me. I thank Isayama for creating this amazing girl and I wish she was real.  <br>Na she was worried because she might lose her harem<br> Reiner <br> Bert <br> Ymir <br> Erwin <br>Eren killing two of them will make her lose her harem</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't have to worry since Eren will only go as far as killing the pigner.</br>  <br> borthurt Borpfujos </br>  <br>Lmao <br>How the hell is Erwin and Bert in her harem. I thought bert was in love with annie and erwin gave up his love interest along time ago to that military police guy.</br></br>  <br>whatever harem Reiner chooses Bert follows<br>Erwin joined through eye sex</br></br>  <br> Jean <br> Armin <br> Flegel <br> Frieda <br> Dazz <br> Eren <br>You forgot all of those</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And Sasha and Mikasa</br>  <br>This sounds like it was straightly taken out from tumblr.</br>  <br> Jean <br>Mikasa aleady claimed him<br> Armin <br>Annie already claimed him<br> Flegel <br>added<br> Frieda <br>Historia part of Frieda's Harem<br> Dazz <br>added<br> Eren <br>both equal<br><br><br> Sasha <br>added<br> Mikasa <br>both equal</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Jean <br> Mikasa aleady claimed him <br> &gt;Armin <br> Annie already claimed him <br>Jean's crush on Mikasa is as shallow as piss on concrete and Armin called her cute twice. <br><br> &gt;Frieda <br>Literally drooling over her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oluo, Flegel, Dazz, Bert, Rod are objectively the best looking in snk  <br> Historia part of Frieda's Harem <br>More like the opposite.</br></br>  <br>Bert and Erwin are part of everyone's harems. That's just how it works.</br>  <br>And Reiner first of all.</br>  <br> Jean's crush on Mikasa is as shallow as piss <br>And yet they will be the only happy pairing at the end of the series. Jean will be the President and Mikasa the First Lady.</br></br>  <br> Will Mikasa ever look at Jean? <br> Only if Eren dies (laugh) <br>JMfags BTFO</br></br></br>  <br>You mongol. Eren is confirmed dead, he will not be alive at the end of the series.</br>  <br> MC <br> ever dying <br>You should have realized this after chapter 5.</br></br></br>  <br>Sames goes for Jean.</br>  <br> Titans finally eradicated  <br> Jean marries Mikasa  <br> Jean and his followers leave the walls and travel west with Mikasa <br> Jean travels north channel to find a massive Island (UK) <br> Jean creates a new country called Jean land were citizens don't pay taxes and all types of porn is legal </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never said Jean is gonna die?<br><br><br>See <br><br><br>That would be ironic because in the UK there is almost no kind of porn legal anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He'll probably sacrifice himself to save humanity. Having the coordinate is like cancer and Eren has to die to pass it on.</br>  <br><br>You guys manage to invent new memeis every month</br></br>  <br>They will find a cure in the basement.</br>  <br>Jean is just a background character, who is sometimes used as a filler.</br>  <br>Yet everyone in UK watches any type of porn</br>  <br> Mikasa already claimed him <br><br>Go away Jean.</br></br></br>  I would appreciate it if you disgusting neckbeards stopped talking about my Historia like she's a harem MC and would recognize her as an actual character instead. After all she is the most developed character in the manga, no one else comes close to her. I'm sure my fellow feminists here would agree we need more strong female characters like Historia.  <br> yet crimes are still being made every day <br>Wow.</br></br>  <br>But Historia is just shippingbait.</br>  Will Mikasa get cucked again?  <br> I'm sure my fellow feminists here would agree we need more strong female characters like Historia. <br><br>Oh god just what this thread needs a feminist</br></br></br>  <br>How fucking dare you. How dare you put her on the same level as fujobait but with a vagina. She is a strong woman who needs no other to emphasize her greatness. Historia defeated Rod, ISIS, BRA, MT, Ymir's people and the need for welfare.</br>  <br>Wot?</br>  <br>Why would a feminist like Historia when she's literally stealing all the men?</br>  <br>How? Jean will stay true to her no matter what.</br>  <br>Donut. Thingy.</br>  <br>  Historia defeated Rod, ISIS, BRA, MT, Ymir's people  <br> Rod <br>yes<br> ISIS <br>no one will defeat the ISIS empire<br> BRA <br>Eren<br> MT <br>no one can defeat King Kong except American jet fighters<br> Ymir's people <br>Historia got owned by their futanari dicks</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wish it was like the old threads where everyone agreed Bert was best shingeki and BR was considered canon.  <br>Thank god those days are in the past.</br>  <br>Bert is still best shingeki but BR was delusion from the beginning.</br>  <br>Isn't that what /snk/ wants too though?</br>  <br> Bert <br> best anything </br></br>  <br>First of all Historia is bisexual because that makes her more relatable. Secondly I thought I just told you ugly neckbeards to stop reducing her to shipping bait when she has too much depth for that.</br>  <br> this is what Ymirfag considers reverse shitposting <br>Or you're a butthurt Bortfujo</br></br>  <br>To me.</br>  <br>It's the autistic Janbofag, retard.</br>  <br>Bertfags like Historia.</br>  <br>Not all of them.</br>  <br>You're telling me they're not the same entity?</br>  Is it time?  <br>They hate when you bring up Reiner's love for Historia. They insist it means nothing and that he's in love with Bert.</br>  <br>I am a proud Historiafag. I go by no other title because I stand behind my queen Historia no matter what, even when the mean Ymirfags are bullying her. I can't stand it when they're rude towards her it just makes me wish I could hold her close and tell her I'm happy she was born and kiss her on the forehead. My feelings for Historia are very platonic because I'm not a neckbeard who sexualizes precious angels.</br>  <br>Why do Bertfags like to pair him up with everyone? I bet it's to make him seem relevant wherever they can.</br>  <br>Are they depressed because they saw this thread?</br>  <br>Because they're retarded shippingfags.</br>  <br>Probably.</br>  <br>Cutest shingekis.</br>  <br>Because he's a slut, that's his purpose.  BH isn't a ship </br>  <br>Bert looks like he has down syndrome.</br>  <br>didanwhisperer pls.</br>  <br>Look at those cute precious angels Bertolt and Historia-chan. Brings a tear to my eye to see them so happy I'm so proud to be a Historiafag.</br>  <br>smallest girl and the tallest boy <br>imagine these to fucking</br></br>  <br>Tallest is Mike.</br>  <br>Was*</br>  <br>His dick would rip her, don't even suggest these things.

WHy do I feel that the big TWEEST will be that he's an Orochimaru clone?</br>  <br>Is that legit? Lee married someone!? Holy shit! Yes! I wanna see the mother, and the mothers to the son of Kankurou and Bee.</br>  Movie is going to end with Boruto getting a hit with Rasen-Chidori on Naruto right?  <br>You're implying that Sarada has a crush on Mitsuki which isn't happening either.<br><br>Though he does have a face of a backstabber.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Too bad Burrito will end wanting to fuck Sarada's dad instead while regarding his dad a bit more than before, though.</br></br>  is it really the end or is he planning to make multiple mini series  <br> Who is METAL LEE’s mather??? <br><br>Not TenTen.<br><br>It seems she would be the auntie, though.</br></br></br></br></br>  I've not been in Naruto threads way back since onion guy appeared.<br><br>Can some kind /a/non summarize for me what happened after that?<br><br>Also, is the gaiden over now?

All those babies they experimented on for example...</br>  <br>They are homosexual lovers?</br>  <br><br>No, Naruto(Hashirama) managed to talk some sense into Sasuke(Madara) so he comes home to the village and parts his hair dresses in all black while still being kind of an oddball.<br><br>Sasuke could very well come to realize Naruto was wrong</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hashirama or any Ashura <br> Homo. <br>Indras always get mad becuase of that.</br></br></br>  <br> And if it was Tenten's child it would have said so right there anyways. <br>Not necessarily.

Ino, Temari, Karui, hell even Sakura look more toned and fit because of their training and not eating as much.<br><br>Hinata never looked physcially fit...just soft.</br></br></br>  <br>How the fuck do those shutters work?<br>Its two of them with a support in the middle but when both are up the entire support just disappears?</br></br>  <br>Truly Hinata is perfect.</br>  <br>Didn't she have a crush on Shikamaru? That's quite a jump in preferences.</br>  <br>And Lee had a crush on Sakura. Both get rejected, and find each other. Or something like that.<br><br>Like I said, it's just a wild guess. After all, who would have predicted Choji would marry Karui?</br></br></br>  <br><br>That it has everything except TenTen's name. The kana isn't there.</br></br>  why havent we still gotten any good quality japanese sound for the last naruto movie? I can't take korean voices  <br>It could still be a possibility. His eyes are sort of shaped like Tenten's, and... his headband cloth is the same color as Tenten's in Part II. I'm grasping at straws at this point though. I just want to know who got "the blue beast."<br><br>And I can't tell if that's an earplug or a comm device in his ear.</br></br></br>  <br>The Novel about everyone buying Nh wedding gifts. Her section was her wondering if it's okay to be weird and not get married with kids like everyone else. Then she just whatever and chose weapons</br>  <br>Did you read it? Was it any good?</br>  <br>not that anon but i reccomend it<br>heres a link if you wanna read it:<br>http://cacatuasulphureacitrinocrist<wbr>ata.tumblr.com/post/119175229601/ca<wbr>ca-please-make-a-masterlist-for-kon<wbr>oha-hiden-too</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br> Not falling into the herdmind <br><br>Ten Ten is definitely 10/10. Kinda unique despite always having the short stick end in terms of spotlight.<br><br>I wished Kishi would have spent a bit more of time on her character.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sakura and Ino hiden <br> Sakura immediately flaunt her achievements to Ino for a picture frame <br><br>Why am I not surprise that Sakura is a shitty girl even in the novel</br></br></br></br>  <br>im always kinda rustled from the fact that 1010 has no background at all except her chinese dress<br>hell even Shino got more background than her</br></br>  <br>This... could be beautiful.</br>  <br>being a B-cast in Naruto is being suffering</br>  <br>Suffering for us too since the side characters are the best ones.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=v5G<wbr>cGAnBoes</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>MEANWHILE</br></br>  <br>is she the new Tobi?<br> I LOVE IT </br></br>  <br> X3 Bringing the heat <br>her move could have been more faster though<br>still shes cute as fuck</br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't say Lee is average. The Big Two aside, he could probably beat anyone from his generation. Especially now that Neiji is dead. Neiji and Shikamaru are his banes. Shikamaru is Batman, and Neiji is extremely dangerous to get up close and personal with. <br><br>Also, I vaguely remember Kakashi saying that he is actually talented. That was during Chuunin exams though, so eh.</br></br></br>  I thought Mitsuki was speculated to be Kakashi's kid?<br><br>Didn't Kakashi meet some woman with light blue hair in his gaiden from another country?</br></br>  <br> Dat Hyuga combination ultimate attack </br>  <br> Arrow shows Inojin being Sai's son instead of saying he's Ino's son. <br>Why?</br></br>  <br><br>I'm really sure Lee could open the Gates and blitz Shikamaru the fuck down before he had a chance to come up with anything unless Shika had time to set up beforehand.</br></br>  <br>Yeah I guess it depends on how the fight starts. Shikamaru with prep time is potentially game over for Lee. <br><br>Can you brute force your way through his shadow control jutsu?</br></br></br>  <br>Naruto did it during the war, also hidan and kakuzu did it</br>  <br>Sai is now a more relevant character than Ino despite never being much other than Sasuke's (less autistic) replacement for fillers and movies.<br><br>The character description does say that he is both Ino and Sai's kid and that his last name is Yamanaka.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes. His own physical strength/condition relates to it, which is why he was unable to finish Tayuya off near the end of their fight because he was too tired and weak to have it crush her neck.<br><br>Pretty sure Kakuzu and Naruto broke out of it before too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>so Sai is keeping is codename as his real name and adopted the last name Yamanaka?</br>  <br>Shikamaru should eat his oats and do his squats then.</br>  <br>100 situps, pushups, squats and a 10km run everyday?</br>  <br>Yes, and throw these in for safe measure.</br>  <br>He still has a bomb tattooed on his tongue. He probably doesn't even remember his real name.</br>  <br>Funny enough, according to the databooks, Hinata weighs less than Sakura despite being shorter and bustier.</br>  <br>the bomb tatooed tongue got removed with Danzo's death<br>I'm not sure how sealing jutsu work in this fucked up ninja world</br></br>  <br>She's officially the Konoha ramen eating champ.<br><br>There was a contest, and she won.</br></br></br>  <br>Called the strongest attack in the game in one interview.</br>  <br>Anon, stop. I'm going to run out of tissues at this rate. <br><br>That fucking combination attack though. Incorporating basically everything Hyuga with the 64 palms, Vacuum Wall and Rotation.</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1Bk<wbr>GdsRH5I0</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>For anyone who hasn't seen it, newest trailer for Storm 4.<br><br>Kaguya confirmed playable and Eight Gates Guy is there for like half a second. <br><br>Bort, Salad, and Hokage Kakashi are preorder only and apparently won't be made available as normal DLC later.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The graphics of these games are getting worse</br>  <br><br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ivm<wbr>aDlGAv3k</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Damn, whoops.</br></br></br></br></br>   いつもここでボルトと遊んでるのよね？ <br>Are you always going to play with Boruto here?<br><br> うん！！！ <br>Yup!!!<br><br> リビングとキッチン。生活感にあふれ、温かみがある場所。 <br>The living room and kitchen. It's a place that's overflowing with livelihood and warmth.<br><br> ボルトの部屋。モノが多いがしっかりと片づけられている。壁にはいくつも<wbr>のポスターが！！</wbr> <br>Boruto's room. He has numerous things that are neatly tidied up. There are a large amount of posters on the wall!<br><br> 広々としたうずまき家の内装を大公開！！ <br>It's the huge release of the spacious interior of the Uzumaki home!<br><br> 今回はうずまき一家過ごす家の中まだ案内するぞ！４人が普段どんなところ<wbr>に住んでいるのかがわ かる！！</wbr> <br>This time, it's the guide to the inside of the home of the Uzumaki family! Discover what kind of spacious place that the the four of them usually reside in!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course it's not tenten, I thought she said in one of the light novels she wasn't going to have kids and just care for her weapons</br>  <br>So they are finally going full on with the Naruto/Hinata minato/kushina parallels. Between this and the gaiden books it seems like Naruto and Hinata were hanging out a lot. How the hell didn't they fug before the last?</br>  <br>I wonder if Himawari will still want to play there with Boruto after the cake smashing.</br>  <br>You're expecting a shonen protagonist to know about sex?</br>  <br>I have no doubt that there will be more. Obviously not by Kishi though, Naruto is too big and would make too much money for Jump to not get someone else to make more</br>  <br>he did say he felt calm or something along those lines when he was around hinata</br>  <br>I thought they were gonna recycle Hanabi's moveset from UN3. Glad I was wrong.</br>  <br>Naruto was straight up autistic. He thought his relationship with Sasuke was what having a best friend was like for fuck's sake. How can he understand romantic love if he doesn't understand the basic rules of friendship?</br>  <br>everytime</br>  <br>During shikamaru gaiden, which takes place before the last, they even state that Naruto hangs out with Hinata a lot. So they were basically dating already.</br>  <br>The Last showed he's sort of liked her for awhile, but some strange misunderstanding caused him to confuse it with something else.<br><br>Like "Oh, she likes me like she likes ramen".<br><br>It was probably the most dense MC thing to ever happen.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Doesn't that just justify the thread then?</br></br>  <br><br>Fat weighs less than muscle. No shit.</br></br>  Ramen guy has seen some shit.  <br> Kishimoto said it's over for good after Boruto movie is out. He won't do anymore Naruto after that. <br>I hope this is true. I want BENCH! to get serialized as the one shot was better then the entirety of Naruto sans Land of Waves.</br></br>  <br>HE won't do anything<br><br>The company might try to find out some way to keep going, like really extending the fillers in the anime.</br></br></br>  <br> Metal Lee <br>Best thing about this movie so far. Amazing fucking name. <br><br><br>Dr. Snakes</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Does this mean Bort is the new Coolest Guy?</br>  <br>So where can I read those gaidens? Are all of them translated?</br>  <br>Source.<br><br>Stop spouting bs</br></br></br>  <br> playing with Bort <br> after he nukes her cake <br>She really is Hinata's child.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if Metal Lee's kid will be Steely Dan</br>  <br>They're released in English, even before Japan, so yes</br>  <br>They truly surpassed Kakashi's generation of wizards. Except for Shino and Tenten.</br>  So why was this fatass even in the story? What was her fucking purpose?  <br>Don't see why people are this suprised. He's shown every girl in Konoha he has almost infnite stamina (compared to the avergae ninja) and he's ripped from years of training. Of course he's getting poon, eyebrows or no</br>  <br>They already dress the same.</br>  <br>Do we have expert weeaboos here who can explain function of that half-spoon half-plate thing Hinata's handling her noodles with?</br>  <br>Hinata is nothing like Kushina. Nothing</br>  I do agree that Naruto doesn't need a general and the optimal solution would be to let those threads die with time. Forcing people to stop discussing it only increases the amount of shitposting.<br> In this regard both the mod and the anti naruto posters are wrong to me.<br> Worse thing is that the naruto haters use the boogey man of tumblr and reddit when they know that people discuss Naruto because it's so bad it's fun.</br></br>  <br>To be a sassy black chick?<br><br>I wish I was kidding and I know someone is going to say Greek Chorus but Chouchou was only there to talk shit and get hit. <br><br>Kishi may as well have just had Salad and Killer B hang out instead.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Comic relief and I guess finally showing a relevant BFFship that doesn't involve masochist homolust or fighting over some guy.</br>  <br>soup spoon, Asian style.</br>  <br>What is nigger's natural affinity in action stories? Comic relief. Though I think she drove the joke too hard making it a bit cringy by the end. Still despite how cliche her ending was, it was endearing.</br>  <br> this entire time Sauce was only pretending to be redeemed <br> instead of pursuing his REVOLUTION in the open he's carefully plotted and planned over the course of 12 years <br> waiting for a worthy successor who could make his plan a reality <br> finally he has found that successor </br></br></br></br>  So,is Konohamaru banging Hanabi or the ugly shit from his group  <br>So he's literally Madara 2.0 and Salad is Obito 2.0?<br><br>All that needs to happen now is for Sasuke to give Salad his Rinnegan to give to Bolt, kill himself and then get Bolt to use Rinne Tensei as a way to parallel the whole Madara/Obito/Nagato situation.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you that stupid, or can you just not process that image correctly with Naruto being the Kushina in that image?<br><br>Naruto is the Kushina in the relationship, they even say their personality is the same. He's even the one that lines up with her in the flashback.<br><br>Hinata is the Minato of the relationship, she even lines up with him in the flashback. They even have that same yin/yang thing. In that recent official image showing the Naruto family breakfast Naruto was also the one acting like Kushina over reacting to Bort escaping out the window, and Hinata was acting like Minato all calm.<br><br>For some reason this trips up some people, despite them being even more overt with it here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>forgot pic</br>  <br>But making it out of ceramics means it's too thick to accurately scoop liquid, plus it seems to be designed for standing on a table. Just seems like a bad design for tableware.</br>  <br>But Minato was a pussywhipped beta that did everything Kushina told him to do and was the hokage breadwinner of his household that created his son's signature technique.</br>  are japanese family dinners always like this? where the parents look disgusted at their kids?  <br>The look on Sasuke's face is like "It just struck me that I'm stuck with this for the rest of my life"<br><br>That's some hardcore dejection if I ever saw it.</br></br></br>  Why isn't Shikamaru Hokage?  <br>because HURR NARUTO<br><br>Also, I assume Shikamaru wouldn't want to do all the paperwork and boring shit like that</br></br></br>  <br>Not enough charisma and powerlevel</br>  Who the hell fucked Kankuro?<br><br><br>Cause he's a lazy fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't even know what was Kishy trying to convey here. Maybe it's supposed to be the moment Salad asks Sasuke to train her tomorrow and they now have to break it to her that his mission is not over?</br>  How much better would the series be if Shikamaru was the protoganist and Naruto didn't get ridiculous power levels?  <br>based Ramen Man, supported Naruto right from the beginning, when everyone hated him.</br>  <br>A Hokage is a face, a symbol, a symbol of power as well.<br><br>Naruto excels at that much, and being the power house. Meanwhile he picked Shikamaru as his #2 to make sure everything is running smooth.<br><br>People think Naruto isn't smart, but picking Shika was super smart.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who's that Killer B looking motherfucker?</br>  <br>Because that's how politic work, you make the charismatic popular guy the president and actually smart and competent man as his "council" who actually runs shit.</br>  <br>After the rock band?</br>  <br>Killer B's son. He got Gyuuki pendant and same horn mark on his cheek which I assume is bijuu imprint on the user and his kids like Kurama's whiskers in Uzumaki family.</br>  <br>Bee porked Samui. He loved big titties.</br>  <br>People that liked Naruto before it was cool<br> Ramen Man <br> Hinata <br> Iruka </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yo, when did the Geralt have a kid and why did he become a ninja?</br>    <br>Thought so. Good on him. <br><br><br>He did loves him some big titties.<br><br><br>Lucky bastard, managed to get with the hot stuff of Kumogakure. Samui lucked out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you make the charismatic popular guy the president and actually smart and competent man as his "council" who actually runs shit. <br>Gaara confirmed for charismatic emo</br></br>  How would Lee fare against all the other fighters of his generation? (part 1)<br><br>Vs. Chouji: Chouji is only deadly when given the chance to land a punch, and even then, Lee could take whatever he throws at him until Chouji goes full butterfly, and even the, butterfly mode is still inferior to 8 gates of power<br>Outcome: Victory<br><br>Vs.Ino: If the games are anything to go by, all he needs to do is watch out for poison and keep moving so she doesnt get the chance to lock on him and take his body. Even if she did, its Goku vs. Ginyu all over again; she can't use his techniques whereas he might be able to get Ino's body to open a gate at most; she's pretty fit and might be strong enough to.<br>Outcome: Overwhelming Victory<br><br>Vs.Kiba: Kiba is a very linear attacker and has probably developed his techniques the least of the Konoha 11. Lee just has to watch out for whatever dog Kiba is working with these days and dodge when Kiba is going to use Fang over Fang. Could probably tank it even if it landed, kid Naruto survived like three of those. Kiba's ultimate technique might be cause for concern, but he can run circles around it all day.<br>Outcome: Victory with minimal injury<br><br>Shino: A little more dangerous; he's poisonous, his insects get everywhere and he's full of bugs. Lee will have to avoid direct contact with his body and make sure Shino's bugs dont get inside his body to block chakra points or eat his chakra. Will probably need to activate gates for this to finish him off quickly. Shino with a plan is basically a creepier Shikamaru.<br>Outcome: Victory with a few insect bites<br><br>Shikamaru: Don't give him time to booby trap the field and you're fine. Lee will just have to watch out for shadows and the shade in general to make sure Shikamaru doesnt trap him.<br>Outcome: Overwhelming Victory in an impromptu fight. Victory with some injuries if Shikamaru has prep time<br><br>Hinata: Deadliest fighter to Lee after Naruto and Sasuke.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sasuke too according to the last chapters but was too tsundere to show it.</br>  <br>Gaara is more of a walking army.</br>  <br>Did you see the crowd of fangirls when he was revived that time he died?<br><br>Of course he's super charisma man<br><br>Naruto also has fangirls now apparently</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kabuto on the bottom leading a zombie army that killed tens of thousands of ninjas <br> he now runs an orphanage </br></br>  <br>Sasuke too. He even put Sakura in her place to defend him in ch3 and pic related.</br>  <br>I'm a Hinata fag, but Lee just wrecks Hinata in part 1. death by one touch is nothing, if you can't hit something and Lee's taijutsu in general is far beyond chunin level in part 1</br>  <br>They say guys without eyebrows are all charismatic. <br><br>Well hot damn, that applies to me too.</br></br></br>  <br>He is doctor snakes now. He is cool man.</br>  <br>BLACKED<br>L<br>A<br>C<br>K<br>E<br>D</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What about your faggot goatee?</br>   This fucking shit is going to end and no fucking Kakashi Face.   <br>do you live under a rock?</br>  <br>We've already seen it officially, in one of the gaiden chapters.<br><br>Stop being a month or two behind</br></br></br>  <br> he doesn't know <br>top kek</br></br>  <br> every thread </br>      <br><br>Best kages in comedic duo. Honestly for all the deaths war brought a lot of edo tenseis were fucking hilarious.</br></br>  <br> ah.. ah... <br>Kakashi is turning me on.</br></br>  <br>Oh you want to go, bitch? Everyone knows the reason you cover up your face is because you kept breaking every mirror you walked past and accrued enough bad luck to encounter me.</br>  <br>I have no clue who Kankuro fucked but, I'm happy he gets a kid. He's underrated and lost potential as a character to me.</br>  <br>Given Kankuro's spread in the databook. He's a bitchin father for any potential kid. <br>Plus being related to two kages is going to give his kid mad prestige.</br></br>  <br><br>Gaara had two girls since fucking Part 1 who were literally dropping their pussies for him<br><br>I'm mad</br></br></br></br>  How would Lee fare against other fighters in his generation (cont'd)<br><br>Vs.Hinata: He'll have to strike hard and strike fast. 5th gate will probably be necessary. Will have to take her out before she can shut his chakra points down and immobilize his limbs.<br>Outcome: Victory if he goes HAM from the beginning.Possible Loss if he actually lets her use trigrams on him<br><br>Vs.Sakura: Probably the only person in Konoha besides Tsunade he can overpower Lee in a straight-up contest of force, and even then the difference in their strength probably isn't that great. Can beat her if he uses 6th gates speed and hits fast and hard. Lotus will most likely be necessary, and even then he'll have to make she she doesn't grab him in the middle of it or something. Basically an Iron Man vs. The Hulk situation<br>Outcome: Victory if he goes HAM from the beginning. Loss if he goes easy on her because shes Sakura-chan.<br><br>Vs. Ten-ten: Will have to fight her in a field she has not had time to booby trap if he wants to win. Can dodge every weapon she throws at him even without gates. Will need to be very familiar with what weapons can do if he wants to win unscathed. Once he comes in close range, the battles decided; he's better and faster even if the only weapon he knows how to use is the nunchucks.<br>Outcome: Overwhelming Victory if he is very familiar with her weapons and if he brings his A game in dodging. Victory if he's a little more careless.<br><br>Vs. Gaara: He'll have to bring his A game with speed and force if he wants to survive against Gaara. If the fight takes place in an area thats even remotely sandy, he'll have to activate gates, probably even the 7th gate. Must avoid Lotus since that did not end well for him the last time; will have to pummel relentlessly and mercilessly without allowing Gaara to breathe for even a second. Must not get caught or the battle is over.<br>Outcome: Victory if extremely bloodlusted and fresh from beginning. Dead if he allows Gaara to make more sand and catch him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Agreed. I like Hinata and I think even in part 1 she could pull her weight and would completely wreck most of her fellow kunoichi (in the Leaf, Temari would beat her no sweat) and even some of the competition not hindered by having a vagina in Kishi's world, but Lee trained his ass off to beat someone who is faster, stronger and better at every combat move that Hinata can do, plus knows a bunch more shit.<br>Byakugan advantage being proven against Lee or no, she would not stand half a chance against Lee and to claim otherwise is ridiculous.<br>Part 2 (war arc) might be a different story however, though pretty damn close, and whoever wins is decided by what we are presuming either criminally underused character can do.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm talking about present day Konoha 11, but I agree; its over if she isn't doing Kaiten every minute or so to make sure he stays the fuck away from her</br>  <br>So she can go from Queen Latifa to Beyonce eventually<br>Then everyone who talked shit about her in the past will take it back to fap to her new form<br> I don't have a problem with this form though, she is annoying though </br></br></br>  <br>He could potentially be Gaara's kid and was trained by Kankuro. He looks pretty pale.</br>  <br><br> (part 1) <br>looks like this confused me and was meant to be part 1 of a very long post,<br>yeah... sorry</br></br></br></br>  <br> Salad is Obito 2.0 <br>No, Obito 2.0 would be Naruto's son, I'm calling it</br></br>  <br>Bolt is Menma</br>   Path of Ninja never continued   <br>Well then that would be shit-tier unlucky for that kid. Gaara doesn't really provide any sweet benefits, if I recall his Sand powers are only because he had Shukaku in him his entire life. <br>Not sure those would be inheritable. <br>He also doesn't have access to the bitchin amount of natures Kankuro has. <br><br>That kid had better be using Sasori/Mother/Father puppets at some point.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that Sakura face </br>  <br>What emotion is that even trying to convey?<br>Sasuke and Sakura look like they have the same case of man face.</br></br>  <br> that necklace on the Cloud boi <br>Did B take on a student?</br></br>  How can anyone believe Kishi actually likes SS?  <br>Because Sakura has a tonned body.<br><br>Muscles weight more than fat</br></br></br>  <br>Not likely.

If I could say this in the straightest way possible, I would, but it'll sound gay no matter what, so here it goes. I think I would personally feel comfortable being Shinji in this scene, because Kaworu is a Jesus figure who completely loves you in a totally non-gay way.<br><br>Fuck, does anyone know what I'm trying to say?</br></br></br>  <br>No. A real alpha doesn't need to prove his manhood, he just prefers a feminine companion as a counterpoint to his masculine energy.</br>  <br>Sounds like you're a lonely faggot.</br>  <br>Too yan.</br>  <br> totally non-gay </br>  asuka is the absolute worst, and I have never understood her popularity. a pity shinji didn't finish throttling her.

I'm just saying that he's the kind of Jesus figure alien demigod that would show unconditional platonic love and acceptance towards you, and that if it was just me and him alone naked in a bath after a bunch of traumatizing shit, I seriously wouldn't mind him putting his hand on mine as a sign of comfort because I know it wouldn't lead anywhere, and he's not doing it in a sexual way despite the setting, so I don't feel threatened.<br><br>Kinda like if your dog ran into the bathroom while you were taking a bath from a really emotionally difficult day and started licking your face when he sees you trying not to break down. The dog wouldn't turn the situation into bestiality in the same way Kaworu wouldn't turn his situation into something gay.<br><br><br> Not using RAR files </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh wow you are just as buttmad as your psychopath waifu arent you? i cant even take you seriously</br>  <br>If I had a person like that in my life I'd want to fuck him.</br>  <br>Do you want to become one with me, anon-kun?

Didn't they both have the same objectives?</br>  <br>He's talking about 3dpd</br>  <br>Gendo just really missed his wife.</br>  <br> Originally I think it was implied she killed him though Anno went ahead and either in an interview and/or in a later eva book or something said that no, she didn't kill him and that it was someone from the Section Two/the men in black. Even so, personally I think its up for the viewer to decide on who they think did it, and Misato having been the one forced to do it does deepen her character development obviously. </br>  <br>The difference is who would be in control of Instrumentality, which meant 90% of their plans were the same, with the difference being in the final 10%. What Gendo would've done beyond getting Yui back isn't really clear, but his plan was to use Rei as his vessel for Instrumentality, while SEELE planned on using Unit-01. Their plans ended up colliding in such a way that gave Shinji control over Instrumentality, which SEELE basically rolled with because the end result was close enough to what they wanted anyways. And Gendo did get to see Yui again in the end as well.</br>  <br>It's not Misato, and if it was ever meant to be her it would have shown her gun firing. She uses an HK semi-auto, but the assassin used a revolver.</br>  <br>It doesn't matter, Kaji was a liability to both. It was a mistake to not just show a Security Intelligence agent.</br>  pssst<br><br> kaworu </br></br>  <br>actual best girl</br>  <br><br>Nope.</br></br>  <br>Get out gay boy</br>  <br>Did they actually show a revolver? I thought they never showed the gun explicitely.</br>  <br>Nah, some of the supplementary material confirmed it was just some random mook.</br>  <br>God damn it. Do you mean this? This isn't in any cut of the show.</br>  <br> laser sight on a revolver </br>  <br>she looks like nerdy high school liz lemon</br>  <br>And it's on top and to the side, it is the most cumbersome fucking thing. In this continuity even Gendo is more comfortable with a gun than whoever this is.</br>  <br>i see that bead of sweat kaji. dont try to act so cool man</br>  <br>Well, as a reifag, I can say that I like autistic people, they have their own way of being "funny" and adorable.</br>  <br> and Misato having been the one forced to do it does deepen her character development obviously. <br>nope, that just makes no sense<br>at no point in the show she is shown as someone who would be willing to do that<br>it dosnt deepen her character, it plain up contradicts the characterization we were shown so far</br></br></br></br>  <br>Misato capped those SDF goons and she did pull a gun on Kaji when she found him in Terminal Dogma, but I agree that it's outside of her character to actually kill him, especially after everything he showed her</br>  <br>Character she receives really early on even, like prioritizing Shinji's health over killing angels and almost dying to protect people from the sabotage of Jet Alone. Misato is the moralestfag of Evangelions, she's not down with the cloak and dagger.</br>  <br>fuck off fujoshit</br>  <br>6 months ago you could be banned for this.</br>  How about making this a best Angel thread?  <br/>  <br>Ramiel is indeed best angel</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=IL7<wbr>aumOZfms</wbr>  [ ]  Rei is the best character.  <br>10/10</br>  Shikinami or Sohryu?  <br>Shikinami</br>  Kaworu or Kaji as #1 bae?  <br>Why not both?</br>  <br>My nigga<br>I don't get why people say Sohryu is the best girl when Shikinami fixes all her issues</br></br>  Enjoy the fanfic.  <br>makes more sense than EoE, really.</br>  Anyone else watched Eva around 15 years of age and found Asuka desirable but few years later found her to be just a scared little child and not attractive romanticaly anymore?  <br>I always thought of Asuka that way.<br><br>The real treasure is Rei.</br></br></br>  <br>I might be autistic but the fact that she's scared and insecure deep down makes her more interesting imo<br>I know about the whole don't put your dick in crazy thing but I'm attracted to girls I can "fix". Is that fucked?<br><br>Rei's arguably even more damaged than Asuka, though<br>There isn't one main character in NGE who doesn't have serious mental issues</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Indeed, but being damaged is one thing, dealing with it is another - which Rei does in a growing, positive fashion.<br><br>That makes Rei the treasure. She's more damaged, taken more figurative punches to the face, yet she's still growing.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought Kaji was pretty normal.<br><br>Although being normal considering the circumstances may not be actually normal at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah you're right. Their circumstances and their disorders are different though, but I agree that Rei's evolution was more positive throughout the show, excluding EoE<br><br>Compared to the others I guess so.</br></br></br>  <br><br>my 15yo self would have hated Asuka because I didn't understand the concept of a Tsundere and had thought that she is "just mean". today it's completely different</br></br>  <br>More like you never grew up.</br>  <br><br> growing watermelons while everyone's shit gets fucked up <br> normal </br></br></br>  <br>It makes for a much less interesting character. Shikinami is just a typical grumpy teenager in 2.22, a bit of a loner, but we see her open her self up.<br><br>Her Tsun-anger doesn't make much sense in 3.33, to her Shinji is should just be some fucked brat up from 14 years ago who she roomed with 2 weeks. She should have no personal connection with him.</br></br></br>  <br>he's just fearless</br>  <br> excluding EoE <br>I guess you must mean the part where she gives up on being human and not the part where she defies her programming.</br></br>  <br>I'd call growing into a godlike being and asserting her dominance over Gendo a good thing.</br>  <br>Yes, the character is less interesting but she's much less psychologically broken.<br>Her anger comes from the fact that 3I was caused by Shinji... Isn't that it?</br></br>  <br><br>I didn't mean that Rei didn't get a positive evolution in EoE, just that EoE is the only part of Evangelion where Asuka manages to move forward and confront her problems in a good way<br><br>He probably knew he was going to die anyway</br></br></br></br>  <br> I've seen cows more attractive than that hideous thing. <br><br>Yeah, but I've seen some pretty attractive cows in my time.<br><br><br><br>Your pic title is lies!  she looks like a shinji in a wig, and a shinji is no man </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Asuka only moves forward because the plot moves her forward, I don't give Asuka any credit.<br><br>It's forced.</br></br></br>  <br>Well she does because of Instrumentality, do you consider Instrumentality to be a forced plot device?</br>  <br>I suppose that could be it but she seems personally invested in it. She should probably have a more "disgusted" or view of Shinji as an enemy or threat than they she does, It seems she would be angry in the same way a general might get made at another for sacrificing a lot of men for trivial reasons, when she should just view him as a simple bad guy for the lack of a better word.</br>  <br>I consider instrumentality an outside force, in other words whatever power made the positive change in her happen it doesn't come from within Asuka.</br>  <br>Then you must believe Shinji's development is also forced.</br>  <br>It is.</br>  <br>Say you're depressed and you go to a therapist. After several sessions, you're no longer depressed. Is your own development forced?</br>  <br>going to a therapist != being forced to go to a therapist<br><br>therapist != world ending</br></br></br>  <br>I suppose she does have a personal bond with Shinji. It was shown several times that piloting defines her as a person (or so she thinks) and that she views Shinji as a special person due to the fact that he pilots as well, although he always disappoints her. Also, it's true that fourteen years seems a bit much but in Rebuild it was also shown that she was clearly in love/interested in him. I guess that's important as well since she probably hasn't been romantically interested in anyone else since 3I.</br>  <br>Instrumentality for shinji = A therapy session<br><br>Change my hypothetical into you being forced to go.</br></br></br>  <br> Instrumentality for shinji = A therapy session <br>This is a false equation.</br></br>  <br>I'm not sure about that. Talking about Impact and the Curse of Eva is the most she says to him without showing her teeth, she's still calling him baka Shinji there. She seems more pissed that he hasn't changed like she has.</br>  <br>No it's not</br>  <br>She's probably mad that she got infected by an Angel so he could connect with his dad at Rei's dinner party, then he lets her get mauled by his mom by inaction and fucks off inside his Eva while everything goes to shit. Those are pretty good reasons to be salty at him.</br>  <br>The world had to end, and it had to stop everything just to force Shinji into psychotherapy feat. Rei &amp; The Humanities.<br><br>You're damned right it's forced. What's there of value for the narrative is the thought process that leads to healing. That's the important bit, after it's started Shinji's healing process is a matter of course to the viewer, and Shinji.<br><br>Shinji's development into what viewers presume to be a "happy kid" like in NGE's ending, or at least someone who's moved on is less of Shinji's own volition and has more to do with people setting him down to do it than it has to do with Shinji powering through.<br><br>He's not uninvolved, but he's forced to by an exterior force that's also providing him with the means to recover without really trying. Instrumentality's function is to complement people's souls, to give them peace and quiet and the tools to fulfill themselves. Something real life won't give you.<br><br>Basically considering these characters, as far as personal strength goes it's Rei &gt; Shinji &gt; Asuka .</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess its because I don't think she should though, at least realistically speaking. I mean she only knew him for a few weeks, had a little crush on him, nothing as close and complicated as in NGE, and then somehow he fucked up the entire world. Over all those years you think the bond would simply drain away and Shinji would just become an abstract bad person in her head. I just don't find the relationship there after them only knowing each other only for a few days, maybe her lack of aging keeps her in the adolescent mindset though, I dunno it at seems far fetched to me.<br><br> Anno can make it up by having asuka sexually abusing shinji though </br></br></br>  <br>See <br><br>It's a world ending event that literally changes your very body and soul without you having any say in it.<br><br>It's much more than a therapy session.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She did seem interested up until her conversations with Misato and Rei in the elevator, but after that she willingly backed down from her little cooking rivalry so Rei could have her party.<br><br>With her being 28 and him 14, I feel she's unwittingly stepped into Misato's vacant role and what we're seeing is a repeat of the Shamshel situation. She's pissed that he keeps running away.</br></br></br>  <br> Loveless <br>grill</br></br>  <br> event that literally changes your very body and soul without you having any say in it. <br>More like going through adolescence again.</br></br>  <br>Oh shut the fuck up. <br><br>The botttom line is that Asuka a shit.</br></br></br>  <br>The bottom line is your bait a shit.</br>  <br>Not even bait, just the truth m8. If you don't like it, you can get the New and Improved Shikinami (TM).<br><br>Made specifically to make Asukafags forget how crappy the original was.</br></br></br>  <br> not even bait </br>  <br> yfw your only response is denial </br>  <br>And your only response is a gutter-tier shitposting like you did right here.</br>  Postin K/a/woru  <br>Your denial doesn't merit more than shitposting.<br><br>Original Asuka = Abject Failure<br>New Asuka = Action Girl Supreme</br></br></br></br>  <br>dicks</br>  <br>The original Asuka is shit though.

Easy, to get away from the nasty truth.<br><br>Explains why Shikinami and the spinoff Asuka's beat the original in popularity.</br></br></br>  <br>rebuild isnt canon</br>  <br> Why else do I make strawmen of Asukafags <br> Expalins <br>Oh, fuck, you're that Reifag.</br></br></br>  <br> Asuka sucks <br>And swallows too.<br><br>Moot agreed, don't bother him beyond the grave about it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> denial <br> calling your shitposting for what it is <br>Why am i even feeding you?</br></br></br>  <br>Don't confuse your mother with Asuka.</br>  <br><br><br> no response <br>Someone hit the nail on it's head!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not like it's hard to do so. It's so obvious.</br>  <br><br>The original ain't a bad character but it's still weak.<br><br>I'm not surprised the entire Asuka fanbase projects a fantasy over the original.</br></br></br></br>  <br> rebuild isnt canon </br>  <br>If it wasn't so hard, they'd do it already. The only response deluded Asukafags have is shitposting.</br>  <br> still fishing for replies by trying to be more agreeable <br> using it's <br>Fuck off you blimey unsubtle cunt.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't be mad you're laid bare.</br>  <br> they'd do it already <br>But I did, you got called the fuck out and clammed up. You only respond now because someone else noticed you all got quiet and brought that to the table.</br></br>  <br>I don't get why you're so pissed. It's a fucking normal thing to do. Do you seriously think everyone has a perfect understanding of the fictional works they consume or idolize?</br>  <br>F. See me after class.</br>  bust out the eva threads while waiting for new season  <br> fishing for replies is a normal thing to do <br>Come back when you learn how to bait better.</br></br>  <br> been posting regularly <br> "clammed up" <br><br>Don't get mad Asukafag. Still waiting (hoping) for you to come with any sort of rebuttal.</br></br></br></br>  You know Asukafags are buttflustered when they dont even try to argue.  <br><br><br> butthurt Asukafag doing damage control <br><br>You're just making other Asukafags look bad.</br></br></br></br></br>  fuck off moot this thread is about how shit Asuka is  <br/>  Gintama thread.<br><br>Isn't the fact that they've made a new OP kind of worrying? Last time they went through so many OPs we only got around 50 episodes. Is it safe to assume we're getting 4 cours this time? I'm pretty sure they've got more material to cover than that.</br></br>   screen time when   I'm thinking two cours. Most likely not 4 unless they plan to completely catch up to the manga.  <br>Author is trying to end the manga soonish anyways, he just doesn't know how or when</br>  And so, our piece goes on!<br><br>Kansai-hen when</br></br>  <br>Roll</br>  <br><br>She doesn't have much screentime, but I like midori.
