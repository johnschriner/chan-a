[  Character clearly says toilet <br> Subs read as bathroom. <br><br>Why do they ALWAYS do this? It's like when they say lolicon and subs say "pedophile".</br></br></br>  Because it's a Japanese loanword. It means both.  Why do people keep saying Sena was pooping in that scene? She was clearly only peeing. In fact, the only one who pooped was Maria.   pinchi <br> I'm in a real bind </br>    ITT: post yfw Yozora won the Senab owl  <br>What is the context behind this scene?</br>  <br>How would you translate it?</br>  <br> It's like when they say lolicon and subs say "pedophile". <br>Basically the same thing.</br></br>  <br>I'll give you toilet but lolicon isn't even a real english word. Leaving that as it is is the equivalent of putting "kawaii" in your subs.</br>  <br><br>Did you watch the show?</br></br>  <br>being "in a pinch" is already idiomatic english</br>  <br>What episode is this?</br>  <br>Only amerifat English, I think.</br>  <br> No_ </br>  <br>Those words all basically mean the same thing.</br>  <br>Words are made by usage and lolicon is used in english by a large group of people</br>  <br>Closeted weeb pedo's aren't a very large group of people.</br>  <br>Large group my ass. Anime is still niche as hell and the number of people in that group who know the word is even smaller when you account for the fact that the large majority are mainstream narutards and such.</br>  <br>Second.</br>   character clearly says hamburger <br> subs read as salisbury steak <br><br>For what purpose? <br><br>/sage and report you niggers</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>By that extension kawaii should also be considered English now because weebs use it all the time.</br>  <br> lolita complex is not even a real English word </br>  <br>What is a word anyway?</br>  <br> weeb pedo's aren't <br> weeb pedo is aren't <br>So is or aren't?</br></br></br>  <br>Kawaii is already in the Oxford English dictionary so it would be perfectly valid in subs(though I would prefer cute to be used over it).<br>http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/27631<wbr>4?redirectedFrom=kawaii#eid</wbr></br></br>  <br>Because the word toilet sounds more gross than the word bathroom.<br><br><br>Is this from an official source or a doujin?</br></br></br></br>  <br>They probably said HAMUBAAGU = Hamburg/Salisbury steak<br>For a burger they'd say HAMUBAAGA</br></br>  <br>You might not know this owing to the fact that you're probably not a native English speaker but NO ONE uses that term outside of Japan. It's one of those wasei-eigo terms that sounds like English but would make no sense to a native speaker like cool biz or skinship.</br>  Are Japanese people really so perverted they have to get off to the fact that girls also pee?  <br> implying Land of the Fat, home of the Shot is the only anglophone country </br>  <br>Then find me an anglophone country where lolita complex is an accepted phrase.</br>  <br>The United States where the book was written?</br>  <br> it has to be commonplace to be real </br>  <br> cool biz <br>I'm still not sure if it means business casual or just warmer weather clothing.</br></br>  <br>Then I suppose donmai and ecchi are acceptable English words now? The line has to be drawn somewhere or you're going to end up with TV-Nihon level subs. Leaving wasei-eigo untranslated absolutely unacceptable.</br>  <br>But lolicon and pedophile is the same thing and anyone who denies this is retarded.</br>  <br>OOoooo mama the people didnt 100% say the thing they said in the words boooo hooooo <br><br>fuck you</br></br></br>  <br> m-muh slippery slope <br><br>Meet: the Localizer</br></br></br>  <br>Lolita comes from an English novel about a guy who wants to have sex with a 12 year old.<br>Lolita complex is a real life analysis named after the book.<br>Lolicon is the Japanese response to all of that.<br><br>So they're all English words except for "lolicon"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Faithful anime adaptation when?</br></br>  <br>I like how oxymoric this pic is.<br>It's suppose to be "haha he put a "smart person book" inside the porn when it's usually the other way around."<br>But if the guy was actually smart he'd be doing a better job of hiding that smart person book.</br></br></br>  <br>after service is a wasei-eigo term used in Japan to mean customer care. Both "after" and "service" are English words. Do you think anyone outside of Japan understands the meaning of after care?</br>  <br>Americans are afraid of the word "toilet".<br>Just like they are afraid of the word "arse".</br></br>  <br>Never. Lolita is a case against paedophiles. No studio would shoot itself in the foot by making lolicons seem like the monsters they are.</br>  <br>The point is that "lolita complex" was invented by English speaking people, and then the Japanese created their own portmanteau and culture around it.<br><br>Put it this way, "lolita complex" is to "family computer" as "lolicon" is to "famicom"</br></br></br>  <br> It's like when they say lolicon and subs say "pedophile". <br>It's almost as if they want to translate from words the target audience probably never heard to words that they're more familiar with.<br><br>Bad example there, pal.</br></br></br></br>  <br> do you think anyone outside of Japan understands the meaning of after care? <br>The term "aftercare" is used in the UK a lot.<br>Go google it and you will see even the NHS site uses the term.</br></br></br>  <br>http://www.merriam-webster.com/dict<wbr>ionary/aftercare</wbr></br>  <br>If people don't understand simple terms like that why are they watching anime in the first place?</br>  <br><br>Damnit I meant after service. After care is a legit english phrase I know.</br></br>  <br>But poor humbert was the victim,that slut lo seduced him.</br>  <br>Bongistani English uses "at a pinch" instead, same as AU/NZ.</br>   character says juice <br> it's translated as soda </br>  <br>Even the BBC has used the word and tried to distinguish the difference.<br>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-<wbr>30698640<br> "Lolicon", short for "Lolita complex" </br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Because the Japanese use that word colloquially to encompass juice, soda and whatnot. I could have sworn there was a scene in some anime where the guy bought a coke but referred to it as juice.</br>  <br>Wouldn't a better translation be just "drink" then?</br>  <br> soda <br> not pop </br></br>  <br> pop <br> not fizzy drink </br></br>  <br>Obviously most people HERE now that there is a difference although I'm always a little bit worried about the people who are adamant about the difference.<br><br>But there is no English word for lolicon and pedophile is close enough to make sense in most contexts.</br></br></br>  <br>Because in American English, "bathroom" means "the room where you shower or take a shit." because we only use the one room.<br>Japanese has a room that has a bath, and a room with a toilet.<br>I suppose they could translate it as "Water Closet" or "Restroom" but that seems pretty contrived and phony for everyone who isn't British.<br><br>An no one in the UK has enough taste to enjoy animes. They're always watching Doctor Potter and the Page 3 Crickets of Sherlock</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>because it's the same thing duh</br></br>   Character says bitch <br> It's literally translated as bitch. and not as slut </br>  Forever an EOP.  bait thread dont reply  <br>Unless your subs are in bong English, I fail to see how that's an issue.<br><br>Are there even any subs that use British English besides the faux-Edwardian trollsubs for Jojo Phantom Blood?</br></br></br>  <br> no one in the UK has enough taste to enjoy animes <br> animes <br>Also I beg to differer they put in effort to make a glorious dub of Lum.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xRc<wbr>xz1MSPd0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>this dude gets it</br></br>  <br>Are you really so pleb that you can't?</br>  <br><br> not carbonated beverage </br></br>  <br> animes <br>I actually started adding the s just to fuck with people and now I legit can't stop.<br>Like saying legit. or making puns.<br><br>I have problems, but UK still a shit.</br></br></br></br></br>   American says they need to use the bathroom <br> A says they need to use the restroom <br> They are actually taking a shit and not bathing or resting <br>Why do they ALWAYS do this?</br></br></br>  <br>animes is grammatically correct and people who get incredibly mad at people naturally inflecting new loanwords are probably xenophiliacs and fags anyway</br>  <br>No, it's not.</br>  <br>The term "lolita complex" and "lolicon" were wholly invented by the Japanese. The same goes for other "complexes" like siscon, shotacon and the like. You'll never find terms like this in any dictionary or research papers and its use in the English community is most certainly restricted to anime/japanese related topics.</br>  <br> faux-Edwardian trollsubs for Jojo Phantom Blood? <br>They are not trollsubs, though. Translator was legitemately serious about them.</br></br>   character clearly says first-year student <br> subs read as fresh man <br><br>I wish fansubbers would stop using memes like this.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon please, next you're going to tell him he didn't eat sushis for dinner last night.</br>  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasei<wbr>-eigo<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_<wbr>of_gairaigo_and_wasei-eigo_terms</wbr></br></wbr>   sweats club    character says Princess Kaguya <br> subs say Chuck Norris </br>  <br>that big one<br> that grat one </br></br>  <br>I saw the movie a few months ago, and I still cant' really tell if there was supposed to be a message or not. Everything about it was so morally ambiguous that I felt confused and a little violated by the end. Like I thought Humbert was a fucking bro in the beginning, but everything just goes south from there. How the Japs have created loli from this is completely beyond me, makes me wonder if they even read the whole book.</br>   Character says manga <br> Subs say comic </br>  <br>Sweats are for getting sweaty in, if you catch my drift.</br>  <br>Because a proper American lady wouldn't say that they're going to the toilet.</br>   It clearly says "Oingo and Boingo" <br> It is written Zenyatta and Mondatta </br>  <br>That's because "漫画" in Japanese means comics in English, whereas "manga" in English means specifically Japanese comics. That's why it's an entirely valid translation most of the time, unless the original dialogue is specifically talking about Japanese comics and not just comics in general.</br>  <br> and its use in the English community is most certainly restricted to anime/japanese related topics. <br><br>Then what's wrong with using them when an anime is being self-referential towards anime subculture? An english speaker would likely use those terms in that context as well. <br><br>Like how an english speaker discussing anime would say "Rin is so tsundere," and not "Rin is so sweet and sour"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"If I mess up the grammar and barf up a thesaurus, that will make the dialogue all old-timey and stuff, right? I mean, I could read a book from that time period or something, but, fuck that"</br>  <br>https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/トイレ<br><br>The English page is<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toile<wbr>t_(room)<br><br> A toilet room, often shortened to just toilet, may also be called a lavatory, or WC, short for "water closet". <br> In places such as North America where the norm in residences is for there not to be a separate room, the toilet is almost always in the bathroom and a separate room may be referred to euphemistically as a bathroom or "restroom", washroom,[1] "half bath" or "powder room". This is often downstairs, with a sink, primarily for the use of guests.[2] <br><br>It's because トイレ refers both to the actual device and the room it's in, while in American English, toilet exclusively refers to the actual device.<br><br>"Where is she?"<br>"The toilet."<br><br>In American English, this would mean she's literally sitting on the toilet instead of the intended "In the bathroom."<br><br>If you bothered to look up トイレ in a JE dictionary, it says "(abbr) (See トイレット) toilet/restroom/bathroom/lavatory/"<wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish Sena would use me as a toilet.</br>  nice middle -&gt; dandy old man<br>after service -&gt; user support<br>ice -&gt; ice cream<br>American dog -&gt; corn dog<br>mansion -&gt; apartment<br>juice -&gt; drink<br>OL -&gt; office lady<br>consent -&gt; outlet<br>Klaxon -&gt; car horn<br>catch ball -&gt; catch<br>pants -&gt; underwear<br>Y shirt -&gt; dress shirt<br>my -&gt; personal<br>cheer girl -&gt; cheerleader<br>network -&gt; internet<br>baby car -&gt; stroller<br>all back -&gt; greased-back hair<br>cuffs button -&gt; cufflink<br>golden hour -&gt; primetime<br>guard man -&gt; security guard<br>miss contest -&gt; beauty contest<br>paper driver -&gt; inexperienced driver with a license<br>sharp pencil -&gt; mechanical pencil<br>virgin road -&gt; wedding aisle<br>table speech -&gt; speech (at parties)<br>soft cream -&gt; soft-serve ice cream<br>minus driver -&gt; flathead<br>plus driver -&gt; Philips<br>g-pan -&gt; jeans<br>marmot -&gt; guinea pig<br>try and error -&gt; trial and error<br>no check -&gt; unchecked<br>repeater -&gt; repeat customer<br>front glass -&gt; windshield<br>bike -&gt; motorcycle<br>strobo -&gt; strobe light<br>key holder -&gt; keychain<br>tabaco -&gt; cigarette<br>freeter -&gt; job hopper<br>freemail -&gt; free email<br>flying get -&gt; purchasing something before its official release</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   this entire thread   <br> Britbong says they need to go to the water closet <br> They're not changing into water <br><br> Canadian says they need to go to the washroom <br> They're not washing their clothes <br><br> Flipfag says they need to go to the comfort room <br> They're not comforting themself </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://www.crymore.net/2013/09/29/a<wbr>rchives-ggs-jojo-is-supposed-to-be-<wbr>period-not-funny/<br> I devote hours upon hours of study and research.

My reaction image was related to the joke.</br>  <br>Japs separate toilets from baths because bathing is a big deal there, and honestly it's probably more sanitary. <br><br>Americans and other westerners combine toilets and baths because its more efficient from an engineering perspective. The fewer drains you need to install, the better. If you notice the layout of any typical American house, all the drains are clustered or lined up to decrease the amount of pipes running through the house, which saves money on insulation and decreases the chances of damage in winter (if it's a cold climate).</br></br></br>  <br>Do you have that frame a little lower?<br><br>Trade ya.</br></br></br>  What really really burns my biscuits and demotes the subs to trash tier is translating "Papa" as "Daddy". Like not only is "Papa" already an English word, "Daddy" has these disgusting sexual connotations added (look up daddy on urban dictionary or even wikitionary). Wtf is wrong with them? <br><br>The "defense" I hear is "well Daddy is more common in the USA", which is fucking garbage. By this logic you should translate "sushi" to "hamburgers" and "Sakura" to "Sarah". Translation =/= Americanization. Translation means making the Japanese into English so it can be understood, not trying to make them sound like they are Americans by translating English into "more common American English". I call my dad "Pa" do I need an anime fansubber to help translate for my family? <br><br>Anime subbers should learn from KDrama subbers.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Other westerners <br><br>No, its an American thing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh look, it's the sexual daddy guy again!</br>    <br>Was the same in Mexico (Yucatan) and also in Vancouver, BC. Maybe it's different in Europe, I dunno. Never been there. Though I heard that a lot of Euros have communal facilities instead of private baths/toilets.</br>  <br> The Economist <br> smart person book <br>It's like if Newsweek was written by Rolling Stone rejects. The general news is good, but the features are almost always garbage.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a periodical that talks about something besides chinese cartoons, so to him it's beyond understanding.</br>  <br>It's not the first time they're at it.<br><br>https://archive.moe/a/search/text/p<wbr>apa%20daddy%20sexual/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>More like a poorfag thing.</br>  <br><br><br>"Daddy" is indisputably a sexualized term. Only the most batshit and pedophilic of fansubbers would take one English word meaning "Father" and sub it with another English word that means "Father and/or older male lover".<br><br>But I am not going to argue, I have to go shopping so I will just leave these soruces. So sorry. <br><br>https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dadd<wbr>y#Noun<br><br> (informal) male lover. <br><br>http://dictionary.reference.com/bro<wbr>wse/daddy<br><br> Slang. sugar daddy. <br><br>http://www.urbandictionary.com/defi<wbr>ne.php?term=daddy<br><br> a girls boyfriend or husband..who takes care of her, looks ou ofr her, (like a daddy) it is an affectionate term that should only be used on a man who deserves the ego boost. <br><br>(FIRST DEFINITION BTW)<br><br>No excuse, especially not the half baked, "oh its more common in the USA" excuse which again, would justify translating everyone's names, place names, foods etc. (And photoshopping little American clothes on the school kids since uniforms are not as common in the USA). God forbid retarded anime fansubbers read Berenstein bears ("Papa bear"), watch Smurfs ("Papa smurf"), or go get pizza ('Papa Johns", "Papa Romanos",. etc). Their heads would explode since apparently Americans don't know what "papa" means and need "papa" to be subbed as the sexualized term "daddy" for us to understand.<br><br>Or maybe fansubber are just perverts one of the two.

It's fucking weird.</br>  <br>Hit the nail on the fucking head, god I hate that shit so much.</br>  Weird daddy issue stuff aside, I kind of see his point. If you were writing a work set in medieval Europe, would you use "papa" because it fit the setting, or would you use the more generic term "daddy" just because it wouldn't sound out of place in modern american english?  <br>still not english but any anime watcher should know what it means.</br>  <br>I would use "Paw" because it would piss off the readers the most.</br>  <br>This post is a prime example of putting forth a pointless semantics argument to make yourself look smart and educated when all you're really doing is letting everyone around you know that you don't actually understand how language works and have no grasp of what context is.</br>  <br>http://www.waseieigo.com/26hagyou.h<wbr>tml#papamama<br><br> Correct English would be... daddy, mommy, dad, mom, father, mother <br><br> Japanese people may prefer to call their own parents Papa and Mama, but in the UK and America, both terms are seldom used. Formal households may use Father and Mother, but their use is extremely formal, and are not heard in daily conversation. <br><br> The more general terms would be Daddy and Mommy for small children and Dad and Mom for those above the age of 10. <br><br> When talking to other people about your parents or their parents <br> Young children: my daddy/my mommy, your daddy/your mommy <br> 10 and up: my dad/my mom, your dad/your mom <br> Adults: my father/my mother, your father/your mother <br><br> Many adults use my dad, your dad as well. <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128116318#p128127474">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>You write to fit the setting, obviously.<br>If your medieval high-fantasy characters start referencing starwars and thanking obama, you're invariably going to break suspension of disbelief, fail to sell your setting and be impossible to take seriously.<br><br>There's a similar conflict in professional translating where some people tend to confuse their priorities around whether they should be translating to be as comprehensible as possible to a target audience, or to make the same concepts and language presented in the original comprehensible in english.

Japan) because they assume their audience won't understand that the subject of conversation is something cultural, grounded in the setting.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> obviously <br>Your post gives me the distinct sense that you are not a professional translator, but have just read a little bit about it in your failed attempt to learn to speak Japanese.</br></br>  thread    <br>Pls don't bully, Cabbage did nothing wrong.</br>        I'll take your virginity, mom.    <br>What's next?

Umaru-chan - 02 (ABC 1280x720 x264 AAC).mp4   Umami  I like that they're already doing the introduction episodes for the other girls. Good design choice because Umaru and her friends are the real appeal of the manga. Ebina and Kirie get introduced at first but then Sylphin has a few arcs of her own. Excited for this adaptation if it focuses on the girls and their friendships developing more than "umaru is a shit to her brother" (which will be an easy adaptation to do if they just stay true to the manga, which went the friendship path)    <br>She's the bitchest bitch of all bitches.</br>  <br>Is Sylphy's design supposed to be referencing something?

KyoAni  SHAFT<br><br>Trash animation but disguised as "style".<br><br>Kinda like Apple in computing world, "It's a feature. :^)"</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nobody cares about Ufotable outside Type Moon stuff.<br><br>  Madhouse or Ghibli </br></br></br></br>  <br>You cant overrate Sunrise, since without Sunrise there would not be modern anime industry in first place.<br><br>Sunrise, Toei and TMS ARE the anime. The rest are small parazites eating the food remainders of sharks.</br></br></br>  <br>   Ghibli <br>Nigga, I will cut you</br></br>  Trigger. This entire board was seriously saying they would save anime for months on end.  <br>Its a meme, is not supposed to be taken seriously. Of course everyone knows Yamakan is the only true savior of anime.</br>  <br> damage control <br>Just admit you were wrong about KlK being amazing.</br></br>  <br> Its a meme <br>sure faggot</br></br>  <br>shaft, they are horrible outside fanservise remains</br>  <br> Madhouse <br>They're done some garbage but it's hard to ignore all the good stuff they've made too.</br></br>    pa works  <br><br>Actually taking something like "saving anime" (What does anime need saving from to begin with?<br>How can a single show save anything?) seriously is retarded. <br>I'm seriously surprised anyone remotely intelligent can think "saving anime" is anything more than a joke</br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't mean to quote you<br>I wanted to quote </br></br>  <br> nobody cares about Ufotable outside Type Moon stuff <br>Then why is God Eater getting so much shitposting if nobody cares because it's not TM? Doesn't all the shitpsting mean people care about Ufotable outside TM adaptations?<br>Because GE is an adaptation of a videogame by Bandai Namco</br></br></br>  <br>that sounds overrated</br>  Kyoani or Shaft  Pretty much Shaft. They just produce shit and some faggots pretend it's deep.  I'd say Trigger, people suck their dicks constantly but really the only truly notable thing they've done is LWA. Not saying their other stuff is bad - I'm a fan - but it's not enough to warrant the dick riding. <br><br><br><br><br>Say what you will about the shows themselves, but for those who like them KyoAni delivers with an exceptionally high standard of quality.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but KyoAni fans never approach it like how you're describing. They consistently posture those shows as the best of the season. That implies that the studio makes the best shows and they don't, anymore at least.</br>  Studio Ghibli  <br>TRIGGER, GAINAX and SHAFT.</br>    <br>I'll forgive madhouse pretty much anything for their work on the Satoshi Kon movies.</br>  <br>Thread over</br>  Kyoani<br><br>Same show again and again. Same faces again and again.<br><br>Garbage studio for plebs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Becuase it is a fact that every signle KyoAni show except for 2 of them were AOTS if not AOTY. There is no need to beat around the bush when you are stating facts.</br>  <br>Honestly I think they deserve the praise they get.</br>  <br> Boring CGDCT SOLcrap <br> AOTS or even AOTY <br>Hilarious. <br>They're shit</br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean, yeah they constantly make my favourite shows for whatever season they're in, so I'd say they make some of the best. <br><br><br>As far as highly praised studios go, I think Ghibli most deserves it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> but for those who like them KyoAni delivers with an exceptionally high standard of quality </br>  <br>Sure if you're a /v/ermin you won't like CGDCT. But anon KyoAni didn't only do that. They had Key, Haruhi and Free. All objective AOTS.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128116104 <br> tbh <br><br>Kill yourself and then take your corpse back to /sp/</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128116104 <br>You think I care what a /v/ermin says? It is an undoutable undeniable fact that every KyoAni show is AOTS when it airs. If you want to say no give an example shitposter-kun.</br>  <br>Is that even an /sp/ thing? I see it on /int/ more often than any other board  tbh </br>  <br>Thought it was a /mu/ and /p/ meme  tbh. </br>  <br>tbh I thought it was /mu/</br>  <br><br>You really need to pick up your game m8</br></br>  Ufotable<br>Shaft<br>Trigger<br>Modern Gainax</br></br></br>  Kyoani make some pretty decent stuff but they always play it too safe and just stick to doing really similar series. I like them but I wish they would try something different.    <br><br>Kyoani  tbh </br></br>  <br>You know KyoAni wouldn't include 30 sec stills don't you? And be honest.</br>  <br>While I really do love most of their shows, that's a reasonable criticism. They're clearly a technically talented studio, so I'd love to see them branch out a bit.</br>  <br>They did with KnK and it sold nearly nothing. It is clear that their fanbase wants one thing from them.</br>  <br>They would use lights moving arround and show somthing blurry in the background</br>  <br>In real life? Ghibli and Pierrot. On the anime portions of the web? KyoAni and ufo. Maybe Trigger, but at this point there's so much baiting from both sides that I can't even tell what anyone actually thinks about Trigger anymore.</br>  <br>You say that, but KnK was also one of their weakest shows. They need to try something new + have it be good to know whether or not it'll sell.</br>  <br> Trigger is a meme. Trigger niggers were a reality back when LWA aired and everyone thought they were good. Years later and neo-Gainax is doing better shows than those who have left. <br><br>And it would look better than anything PA or Silver Link ever produced.</br></br></br>  Why do so many people rush to defend Kyoani the second anyone makes fun of it?  <br>Because KyoAni is literally the best studio in the industry. Only plebs can have a bad opinion on based Kyoto Animation.</br>  <br>I like KyoAni.</br>  <br>I'd say PA's best stuff generally looks better than KyoAni's aesthetically (KyoAni wins animation).<br><br><br>People rush to defend almost any studio if it gets made fun of.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck Satelight</br>  <br>I don't know anon. NagiAsu had amazing backgrounds but nothing they made looks as good as Hyouka.</br>  <br>Then tell me, why do people shitpost about decent studios?</br>  A1  <br>Uchoten Kazoku was gorgeous.<br><br><br>Because people rush to defend it the second anyone makes fun of it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They made a few memorable anime that happens to be some people's favorites, such as K-On or Haruhi. So they get really defensive when you criticize the studio.<br>Some of the things they make are good (K-On, Nichijou, Tamako, Amagi) while some are terrible (Air, Kanon, Hibike) just like any other studio.</br></br>  <br>Why do people shitpost about decent anime?</br>  <br>Because of their obvious flaws</br>   anyone saying Trigger <br>Trigger has a very niche fanbase. If anything, its vastly underrated.<br>They also saved anime.</br></br>  <br> Kanon <br> Air <br> Bad <br>Are you sure you're not talking about the movies anon? Because they were some really nice adaptations.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll bite; Euphonium was hardly a masterpiece but it was certainly good. What makes you say it was terrible?</br>  <br> This is what Trigger Niggers actually believe. <br>How can you be so stupid and retarded?</br></br>  <br>Kekkai Sensen&gt; Euphonium<br>Garo&gt;Amagi</br></br>  <br>Did people like them? I thought they were pretty terrible. Maybe I was expecting too much since I watched Clannad first.</br>  <br>I haven't been on /v/, and I hate CGDCT SOLcrap<br>Stop forcing your boogeyman<br>And I'm <br>I was just replying to another part of your post</br></br></br></br>  <br> Gay Sensen better than anything <br> Gyaru : the non animation better than anything.  <br>Come on shitposter kun you really have to dig deeper.</br></br></br>  <br>If you like Key stories you'll like them. Especially Air was really enjoyable. Didn't really like how they portrayed the MC in Kanon. But they both were really solid.</br>  <br> kekkai sensen  <br>Bad writing, bad pacing, bad animation. It had a lot going for it (very stylish) but it fell pretty flat.</br></br>  <br>Why?<br>This post just proved to me that you're retarded<br>I won't waste my time anymore with a retarded Kyoanus licker</br></br></br>  <br>Whatever you say, shitposter-kun<br>Try spouting something else than generic blind hate memes, okay?</br></br>  <br>There is just nothing worth watching in it. Just straight up drama.<br>If I wanted interesting animation, I'd watch shaft.<br>The girls weren't that cute.<br>Felt like a waste of time, so I dropped it in the last episode.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit Kyoanus lickers are the most delusional.</br>  <br>To each their own I guess. I generally like "competition" shows, so I dug this one.</br>  <br>Kyoani<br><br>How is this even a question?</br></br></br>  <br>Sunrise is actually underrated in the west while it is a mainstream studio in Japan. Businessmen in their forties will remember Sunrise due to the huge cultural impact of Gundam. The studio has also been the base in which a forth of current late night anime studios originated or worked for during their early days including Deen, Bones, A1, Manglobe and even Kyoani.</br>  <br>  gainax  </br>  <br>No one overrates them any more because everyone knows they have gone the way of Gonzo.</br>  <br>i dunno, do we count the major overrating of NGE and EoE or is that counted separately?</br>  <br>EoE was done by Production I.G</br>  <br>Kyoani</br>  <br> Gainax <br>Everyone knows it's just a shell at tis point</br></br>  <br> Shaft <br> Animation <br>should've just went with Ufotable/Madhouse/Bones if you really want to baiting.</br></br></br>  <br> implying I was baiting <br>Nisekoi was a lot more fun to watch based on animation than Hibike was.</br></br>  <br> shit story <br> barely passable as animation <br>2/10</br></br></br>  I hate SHAFT and their western fanbase so much.  <br> Not hating any kind of western fanbase </br>  <br>How could I hate /a/?</br>  <br>Are you implying that /a/ doesn't hate /a/?</br>  <br>What are you doing here?</br>  <br>how does one pronounce Ufotable?</br>  <br>Mappa</br>  <br>I hate you f/a/ggots less than other forum, I guess.</br>  <br> trigger niggers </br>  <br>But that is Toei anon. Every single known anime director started at Toei.</br>  madhouse. pretentious faggots watch paranoia agent and claim they're the best shit ever even though they haven't made a good show in years.  <br><br>like the mysterious flying saucer and the thing you put your food on</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure Ore Monogatari is still airing</br>  <br> Ore Monogatari  <br> Good <br>For any studio Ore is nothing but an underwhelming adaptation with minimal adaptation and art work. But for the studio that housed Kon this is nothing but shame that current Madhouse fans think highly of it.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope</br>  <br><br><br> People shitpost for months on end <br> Take it all at face value <br>Wow, do you guys wake up and just decide to be retarded or were you born that way? Do you also believe everyone on /a/ are little girls too?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because they're fucking magical. How they continue to release such well animated, detailed TV anime on a reasonable budget is a mystery.</br>  <br>Death Parade was this year. you know<br>And now comes the part where people quote my post to say DP was bad</br></br>  <br>Who cares about animation and detail when it's wasted on boring shows?</br>  <br>I love every Kon film and I don't understand why people like Paranoia Agent at all. It felt exactly like what it was, a lot of separate ideas crudely fit together at a recycle plant.</br>  <br> paranoia agent  <br>speaking of overrated</br></br>  <br> Death Parade <br> Good for the studio that released Paranoia Agent. <br>They are shit since the master died. Everyone knows that anon. Stop denying it. Next thing you say is Parasyte was AOTY.</br></br></br>  <br>It wasn't. Because Garo was AOTY<br>But, Parasyte was still good<br>Also, they released Hellsing Ultimate OVAs after Kon's death, you know</br></br></br>  <br>you triggerniggers never stop do you?</br>  <br>Are you seriously saying something as silly as "saving anime" can be taken seriously by anyone with even the smallest hint of intelligence?<br>Seriously? <br>You must be shitposting</br></br></br>  <br>You mean the dual Madhouse Satelight production of Hellsing? Not on the same level.<br>That's like comparing a Ghibli movie to a KyoAni or Toei movie.</br></br>  <br>What?<br>So just because it's good, it can be used for comparisons? But you said they didn't make anything good after Kon's death. I mentioned Hellsing Ultimate, and now for some stupid reason it doesn't count?<br>Whatever you say, shitposter-kun</br></br></br>  <br><br> Felt like a waste of time, so I dropped it in the last episode. <br>Gr8 b8 tbh  </br></br></br>  <br> Hellsing Ultimate <br>I couldn't even finish the second episode, what a piece of shit.</br></br>  <br>I didn't know it was possible to have tastes this shit<br> captcha is typing numbers <br>THANK YOU, GOD</br></br></br>  There are plenty of overrated studios<br><br> Ghibli <br>The most overrated by mass but also dead<br> Shaft <br>Everything outside of Madoka and Bake gets ignored - And Madoka and Bake are mediocre at best<br> Kyoani <br>Haven't produced anything decent for years yet they still get maximum attention because people eat their Chuunishit and Freeshit up<br> Ufotable <br>Only TMfags praise them.

The second they actually try to do something not TM related, it's a pile of shit and they're exposed for the hack studio they really are.

He's a total hack and should retire or stick to animation/visuals/direction.</br>  <br> their work looks off to me. <br>Personally I just think it looks boring.<br>They need to lay off the CG rotoscoping.<br>Same goes for Kyoani. It has nice shots, but still looks average aside from the random weird camera shots. I'd never watch a Kyoani or a Ufotable show because of their animation.</br></br></br></br>  <br>knk, tamako market, nichijou</br>  KyoAni.  <br>But Kyoani does use CG (like most studios nowadays) and CG rotoscoping.<br><br>Also, while Hibike was very nice, they've produced quite a few weaker shows recently.</br></br></br>  <br> Ufo  <br> CGI 24/7 <br> Implying GE is CGI outside of the aragamis (which need it, because it would be hard to get their detailed designs right otherwise)  <br> Implying judging an entire studio just because of one show isn't shitposting <br>Fuck off, retard</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Aragamis can't be handled without CG. <br>Yeah that's why mosters were never in anime before digital cels and CG right?<br>And honestly outside of F/Z and KnK #3,#5 everything they have done is the definition of mediocrity. Uninspired direction. Rehashed Soundtracks. Shitty studio overall. Such a shame that Hirao went there.</br></br></br>  <br>Anime is dead and was a mistake.</br>  <br> implying KnK movies aren't all great <br> implying UBW wasn't one of the best things of it's respective seasons <br>Nice shitpost<br>Nice shitpost</br></br></br></br>  <br> CG rotoscoping </br>  <br><br>here<br>Also, what I meant is that CG is the best option to handle the detailed designs of the aragami<br>2D would have to sacrifice details. The aragami are VERY detailed, and CG is the bestt way of not losing any of said details</br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean you can have highly detailed hand drawn monsters. Check out any old movie or OVA and you'll see how it can be handled with good talent.<br>Also yeah if you enjoyed KnK#6 and UBW I have nothing to tell you other than get a better taste you fucking secondary.</br></br>  <br>Definitely Ufotable.</br>  <br> Secondary <br> Implying I didn't read F/SN before the anime and before watching Zero <br> Implying UBW wasn't the best adaptation of the source material we can hope to ever get <br> People need to get better taste becaue they enjoy things you don't  <br> Comparing movies and OVAs to TV anime, when movies and OVAs always get a higher budget, and are allowed more production time <br>What an awful shitpost</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean if UBW's adaptation was enough for you have some really shitty standards ufotable drone-kun.</br>  On /a/, Ufotable, mainly by newfags not understand how budget works or how studios make anime and only watched UBW without watching KnK movies.<br>Sunrise is underrated on /a/.<br><br>Shaft isn't overrated anymore on /a/, and KyoAni is just the victim of bait from both sides and loyal fanbase. They're both studios that are very similiar between their anime compared to other studios where it varies greatly. Generally being a fan of a studio is silly because the works they make are not consistent in a lot of ways.</br></br></br>  <br>It's you who have the needlessly high standards<br> Ufo didn't read my mind to replicate how the sceness go , so they're shit <br> Everyone who doesn't share my opinions has shitty standards <br>Can you please fuck off, you shitposter?<br>You tell me I'm a drone, but your blind hate is not any better than being a drone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>SHAFT, Kyoani and ufoTABLE in that order.</br></br>    <br><br>It's actually kind of true, but more accurately the other studios are just kind of small time and realistically everyone depends on Scamco and Jewplex to get by one way or another since their the only anime enterprises with any damn structure and horizontal/vertical integration.</br></br>  <br>Get out.</br>  KyoAni<br>Shaft<br>A-1 Pictures<br><br>I can name a few others but these studios above just pander with way too much mainstream appeal.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I think people want to metaphorically hate fuck Scamco is what's going on. Love Live, Gundam, Tales and idolMASTER discussions are downright bipolar.</br></br>  <br>Toei has always, ALWAYS been shit. In the 80s Sunrise got their shit together, and a lot of their shows have fantastic animation (most recently G-reco)</br>  <br> mainstream appeal. <br>What?<br>None of those studios have mainstream appeal, and even considering the jumble that is A1 is retarded. KyoAni and Shaft pander mainly to otaku.<br><br>Sunrise and Toei are the mainstream studios.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;implying UBW wasn't one of the best things of it's respective seasons <br>But it wasn't.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12811405 <br>This.</br>  <br><br>It's more like every current Kyoani show is the greatest of all time to them. I actually recently started watching Hibike and while it's a little better than some of their recent stuff where it seemed like they barely gave a fuck, even with reserved expectations I still find myself disappointed in the characters. Still too moe blob like and overly cutesy, like far more than even your average moe anime. I'm not anti moe either, I don't even mind Jukki Hanadas work with Love Live, just something about how Kyoani does it feels like the gauges are turned up more than is necessary to find a character cute and quirky such that they come off annoying instead and it's always been like this for them. I'm almost tempted to say they're kind of bad at moe and try to make up for it with exaggerated character movements and face pulling which is why you have shows like that selling okay to the moe crowd, but not as well as say Love Live or other idol shows which have become all the rage now.</br></br>  <br> i'll keep saying they are shitposting,that will show them </br>  <br>K-On was incredibly well-recieved and had a very diverse audience</br>   people saying KyoAni   <br> LET SABER GO I don't care about the rest. <br><br>uhh, are you a wizard</br></br></br>  <br>But it was</br>  <br><br>Honestly why I find their fanbase hilarious at best to annoying at worst. They seem to be of the LOVE ME! and PAY ATTENTION TO ME! Where unless everyone accepts their point of view that everyone of their shows is the greatest thing ever than that just won't do and a deluge of shitposting to bury everyone and everything else must immediately commerce to force people to see "the way". It's very fanatical and childish and is really only rivaled by the Fate fanbases antics in recent times.</br></br>  Be honest, anon.

Pic related for me.  <br>that</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Jt8<wbr>W_FA3QBE</wbr>  [ ]  https://<span>youtu.be/zh56H_QKnow  [ ]<br><br><br>This is a close second though.</br></br></br>  Ranpo Kitan<br>Kangoku Gakuen</br>  PIN PON NARASHITE  Symphogear<br><br>Wakaba and Overlord are nice too.

I say Charlotte.  The only good anime of the season. Hell even the Anime of the year right now. It has action, plot, romance, super powers, betrayal, saints, best girls.<br>Why aren't you watching the Greatest Anime of our Time?</br>  <br>I missed this anime. Is this another generic harem anime?</br>   only good anime of the season <br>I know you're bating but fuck</br>  <br>best thighs of the season maybe</br>  <br>not even close just read the Synopsis</br>   "strongest man in the world" <br> all his powers are gimmicks <br>I hate this guy.</br></br>  <br>yeah that kinda made me mad. but he has more episodes to prove himself</br>  <br> 12 episodes <br> snail pacing <br>Aaand dropped</br></br></br>  Rokka no Sleeping Aid  <br>Yes</br>  <br>its exactly how it is in the novel</br>  <br>No, their pace is slow.</br>  <br>Sleeping aid is NNB</br>  <br>Fuck this bitch is so boner inducing too bad she is a traitorous cunt.</br>   Great fight choreography <br> Hot bunnies <br>I'll stick with it. Might be cool.</br></br>  Honorable combat &gt; using dirty tricks  <br> &gt;&gt;/MAL/ <br><br>Jesus christ i can't believe fuckers like you are here. The pacing is perfect, you got to know Nashetania very well and they're already reaching Majin territory.<br><br>This is mostly about mistery and not only fights so if you want explosions and cool shit watch something else</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except he beats everyone using dirty tricks? <br><br>Dirty masterrace &gt; Honorable faggets</br></br></br>  <br><br>Cry me a river faggot. Go play knights with the other kids, leave the killing of demons to the people that actually want to kill demons</br></br>  <br>Best Ending this season.<br>Probably best OP too</br></br>  <br> The only good anime of the season <br>Not saying very much</br></br>  <br> It has action, plot, romance, super powers, betrayal, saints, best girls <br><br>why the fuck are there so many casuals on /a/ now</br></br></br>      <br>No it's fine, retards like you seem to have been conditioned for animes that cram everything into 20 minute episodes.</br>    <br><br><br>They want things like Yahari that adapts 1 volume per episode. Or danmachi that does the same thing</br></br></br>  <br><br>I think what's happening is this is catching on as a dark horse and some enterprising troglodyte is trying to attract more shitposters too it in response cause they're worries somewhere someplace on the Internet somebody might be having a legitimate discussion over it one way or another.</br></br>  <br>This has been amazing so far.<br><br>You can teel that having a good director is what's needed for a LN adaptation to be good.<br>He did it with Spice and Wolf and he's doing a great job with RnY now. <br>The pacing is perfect and the interactions between characters don't seem forced. Imagine if they skipped all of Nashetania now. Then later people would wonder <br>"Why is Nashetania "worrying" about Adlet"<br>"Why does she trust him so much"<br>"They barely even know each other</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cause they're worries somewhere someplace on the Internet somebody might be having a legitimate discussion over it one way or another. <br>That would be a real shame.<br>OP must be another 7th</br></br></br>  First episode was okay, second episode pretty much sucked. Hopefully the third will bring something interesting to the table.  <br>Not enough fights anon? <br><br><br>Even MAL has better threads than this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish the staff knew how to draw horses</br>  <br> if you find yourself in a fair fight you didn't plan your mission properly </br>  <br>I don't want another fight after that ugly ass 2D on 3D shitfest</br>  <br>IS THIS GOING TO BE SPLIT COUR?<br><br>They have 3 endings and 2 openings announced</br></br></br>  Fremy's outfit is so retarded it loops around to fantastic  Soon.  The first episode seemed interested but the second episode killed my interest.<br>It seems like it will be more about drama between the heroes than actual fighting the big bad.</br>  <br>You should watch God Eater anon, they have coool fights and lots of budget. There's also lots of blood and deep characters.<br><br><br>I think the problem is that they made the flower TOO big</br></br></br></br>  <br>The flower can never be too big</br>  <br>Not that there wasn't enough action (the action that was there sucked anyways), there wasn't enough of anything interesting whatsoever - besides maybe at the end. At least we have some new characters now, so hopefully it gets better.</br>  <br>Yeah it's mistery and the first novel is all about them fighting each other. Well all of them are more or less</br>  <br> this shit art <br> anime of the season </br></br>  <br><br> mistery </br></br>  <br>what? are you an idiot? the whole second episode they introduced more braves and had some fighting.</br>  <br>I felt the same about fremy's design but then I asked myself about the other characters. We've got phoenix hair mcaztec batman, and a bunny girl. They don't address the bunny outfit either, not a single line. Even when she was fucking stealing from the peasants that didn't come up.<br>Also, right after that which set her up as a stuck up princess, she reveals the "I had a hard time as a child" thing. Then the next scene is her being scared in a fight when she talked about beating up her retainer.<br>I don't know where the fuck they are going with her.</br></br></br>  <br>not even close to a harem</br>  <br>Why are you making bait threads so that shitposters can come ?<br><br>Jesus RnY threads were perfectly fine aside from the <br> Strongest man in the world fights dirty <br>meme</br></br></br></br></br>  Bunnygirl is hot but apart from that it's really nothing to write home about. First episode actually made me want to drop it but after the second I'm giving it a shot.  <br>Well, I learned most of it from LN spoilers.<br>But I was expecting a bunch of Braves teaming up to fight the big bad, not Braves fighting each other.<br>I would have watched it for bunny but apparently she turns traitor so I just dropped it. I probably would have eventually anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know what about the first episode gave you an impression that his was going to be about the fights.</br>  how many episodes until something happens?  <br>She was scared about fighting demons. Wouldn't you be too? <br>That's why Adlet makes her deliver the last blow so that she can realize she's powerful enough to deal with them.<br><br>Mayan/Aztecs were all about animal outfits. Eagle warriors, Jaguar knights. Shit like that.</br></br></br></br>  <br> episode 1 <br>pretty good<br><br> episode 2 <br>pretty fucking boring<br><br>i'm assuming the rest of the show will be like ep2 except even more explorations into cliche<br><br>my enthusiasm for the show is already dead</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "strongest man in the world" <br> not an arrogant prepotent fuck <br>I love this guy</br></br></br>  <br>Idiot, I am not saying it's a bad thing, but it is a fact that the pace is slow. They even added scenes to make them longer.</br>  <br> I don't know what about the first episode gave you an impression that his was going to be about the fights. <br>HELLO AND WELCOME THIS SHOW IS ABOUT SIX HEROES FIGHTING THE DEMON KING PLEASE ENJOY</br></br>  <br><br>Dare I say it in the last season or so MAL has almost been more tolerable than /a. The last week for /a hasn't been too bad. At least we've stopped getting constant Hibike and Fate dick sucking threads taking up half the front page and it's not just full on 24/7 shitposting, just the usual levels.</br></br>  <br>nobody take the bait</br>  <br>Yeah I can see that point. I was going to bring that up but its so rare for animu characters to do anything beyond 'well I guess monsters really exist'<br>then just dealing with it. Like seeing a ghost and it having zero affect on your perception of death.<br><br>Is it bait if I take the bait of the guy telling me not to take the bait?</br></br></br></br>  <br>dude this shit is terrible,only original thing about it is use mayan setting instead of the clasical european or nordic setting, but overall is pure shit</br>  <br>Are you dumb? You can literally see 7 fucks in the opening. <br><br>Don't you realize something's wrong? are you seriously this much of a dumbfuck? <br>You want them to go and kill the Majin in the first episode<br><br>Holy shit I swear you people need to stick to Danmachi or whatever shit you like</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're makign you care more about Nashetania. You won't have more development about her in this next episodes because all 7 will get together in the next one.</br>  <br> mayan <br> not aztec <br>look at him<br>look at him and laugh<br><br>I don't blame him for taking the opening infodump at face value. They should've done a fast forward spoiler if they really wanted to give the viewer an idea of how the series will go. They want you to think right now that its just demon king shit, they want you to believe that them braves gonna brave.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sit down you pompous asshat. It's simply not engaging and with it being only 1-cour expect the series to implode on itself with rushed story telling to make up for all the padding come the finale.</br>  <br>Not him, but the entire first two episodes were traveling to meet the other braves and fighting fiends.<br>Its easy to assume they were just going to meet other braves and then travel to the Demon King's land to do whatever.</br></br>  <br>That has nothing to do whatsoever with the fact that they set up the show as heroes vs demon king. You asked what would make anyone think the show is about fighting, and it was implicit in the fucking premise of the show. So far everything has been "gather the heroes, fight demons". <br><br>Regardless, the show is generic as fuck. Sure the central american setting is nice, but it's very superficial so far.</br></br></br>  <br>Except the second episode ends with one hero pointing a huge gun to another hero's face. <br><br><br>The show says that when the Majin awakens 6 heroes are selected and they go fight him. <br>That's it, it's the fucking lore. Not the plot of the series.<br><br>What is good about this is that the story develops in a different way. And there's a lot of foreshadowings in the opening and the fact I said up there about 1 hero pointing a gun to another makes you realize things are not going as expected.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Except the second episode ends with one hero pointing a huge gun to another hero's face. <br>And that's why I dropped it.</br></br>  <br>Why are you in this thread shitposter?</br>   an ancient evil awakens  <br> chosen heroes must defeat it <br> betrayal from within  <br>aots</br></br></br>  <br>Having good time with the LN, I hope the adaptation will be as much enjoyable. <br><br>The first two episodes were good tho</br></br></br>  <br>Someone who knows what they are talking about</br>   Precure thread   MANA DA BES    <br>I bet she can't even 1st grade math</br>    I'm going to marry Haruharu!  <br>Ugly cures after bump limit please</br>  <br>whats that? post more rin?</br>  Haru no Carnival when???    <br>Me too dude.</br>      <br>Akane is just plain better.</br>  <br>Rin is actually very attractive in fan art. Her hair is cool in cure form too. She's underrated.</br>  Ok i think i might have fucked up a bit. I dont know if anyone can help me, but i while back i was browsing /a/ and was looking for a new show to watch, and i came across Fate/stay unlimited blade works, i stupidly watch both seasons and when i came back to /a/ i realized this show is like the 5th installment of the series ( or the 5th grail war? ) <br><br><br>Did i fuck up? is there a particular order i should watch them in, if so what order? Thanks.</br></br></br>  Production order. Always. For everything.  <br>Do you know what the order is?</br>  <br>I've got a link here:<br> www.google.com </br></br>  <br>There's no need to be a dick, ive already tried that and i havent had much luck finding the order</br>  The correct watching order is:<br>Fate/Origins <br>Fate/Entropy Paradox <br>Fate/Hollow Ataraxia<br>Fate/Apocrypha<br>Fate/Extra<br>Tsukihime (tells the Red Man's origin story)<br>Fate/0<br>Fate/Kaleid Liner<br>Fate/Stay Night<br>Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works (a non-canonical spin-off of Fate/Stay Night)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you</br>  <br>He's fucking lying, Fate/stay nigh came out first</br>  <br>Whoa, not that's bait from a salty illyafag. Do not trust that one.</br>  <br> He's fucking lying, Fate/stay nigh came out first <br>Go back to reddit</br></br>  <br><br>FSN (old anime)<br>FSN UBW <br>FSN Heaven's Feel<br><br>The above three cover the 3 major routes of the FSN story. Since the original anime isn't very good, you can skip it / play the VN if you want to.<br><br>After those, watch the prequel Fate Zero, which is the story of Shirou's adoptive father Kiritsugu, and the previous grail war with saber and gilgamesh and kotomine and others.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice b8 chart, m8.</br>  <br>If you want to get into Fate specifically,<br><br>1. Fate/stay night<br>2. Fate/hollow ataraxia<br>3. Fate/Zero<br><br>If you want more, check out stuff like Tsukihime or Kara no Kyoukai.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh man what an insult, le reddit maymay. Seriously kill yourself as soon as possible, you fat loser.</br>  <br>Its not a meme, newfag.</br>  Does anyone have a link to hollow ataraxia , tsukihime and whatever other VNs apart from F/SN?  <br>Tsukihime download here:<br>herehttp://nicoblog.org/pc-games/ts<wbr>ukihime-english-patched/</wbr></br></br>  <br> 2. Fate/hollow ataraxia <br> 2 <br><br>Ataraxia can be played at any time after FSN, hopefully though before you watch Carnival Phantasm.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br>Isn't whole of F/SN this all just a dumb eroge VN? Is it wroth spending time on?</br>  For or the best experience, I recommend playing the fate route of the VN<br>Cause the Deen adaptation totally butchered it<br>Then watch UBW anime<br>and then watch Fate/Zero<br>And then play heavens feel route or just wait for the movies</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's terrible advice. If you're going to read the VN then read the whole thing, don't just skip to Zero 2/3 of the way through.<br>Read Fate, watch/read UBW, read HF then watch Zero</br></br>  <br>Why is fate the best animes of all time?</br>  <br>You just need to have read Fate route before F/Z, you don't miss anything if you haven't read UBW or HF<br>UBW already has an anime, no reason for one to invest his time reading the VN. Sure, the anime didn't cover some important scenes (especially the h ones) but you can make do with it<br>As for Heavens Feel, I guess you should read it cause the movies aren't coming out any sooner</br></br></br>  <br>But it isn't<br>It's just an adaptation of a shitty eroge game minus the porn</br></br>  <br>Did people REALLY take this thread seriously<br><br>what the FUCK?<br><br>I thought morning /a/ was not retarded enough to fall for shitty baits<br><br>oh well</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In the off chance you're not baiting OP, I commend you in having managed to not know about the Fate series at all up until the UBW anime was made.<br><br>Other than that 6/10, people are gonna fall for it</br></br></br>  <br>Hehe nice bait, but I won't fall for it :^)</br>   watching shounen shit   <br> you fat loser <br><br>You're no better than him.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, It's chuuni-shit.
