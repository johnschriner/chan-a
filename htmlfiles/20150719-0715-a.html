[ Fuck, she's on to us.  <br>Well she sits in the back of the jeep. She's not def.</br>  <br>Does she desire Itami's D?</br>   elevens would date anything but jap women <br>not surprised</br>  <br>Nah but animefags want her to be with him.</br>      animefags are the worst liking censored shit.    <br> waahh muh edgy rape scenes are not in the anime <br>stay mad</br></br>      <br>Why are you dumping this?</br>  <br>I'm assuming it eventually turns into some shitty joke where all the characters are disembowling each other while shitting into each others mouths, he's just dumping it much too slowly for it to be effective.</br>  <br><br><br>The scanlator of this manga was offended at the American stereotyping of this manga.

Just stop.</br>  <br>His destiny lies elsewhere, specifically in a Mexican cocktail bar.</br>   tfw no qt elf waifu   <br><br><br>If I was shitposting then there's more effective and less time-consuming ways to do it.</br></br></br>    <br>That artist is a gift from elf heaven.</br>  <br>Read: The Mother just returned to Japan without telling him.</br>  <br> Saving thumbnails </br>  <br>The fuck is this shit? If you are gonna post an image make sure its not the size of an ant.</br>  Being enlisted is suffering.  <br>Why doesn't he just tell her he got a boner in order to get her to get off him in disgust?</br>  <br>did you miss the part where they have different languages?<br>Oh and she'd probably be turned on seeing how she's sitting there.</br></br>  So Itami was basically about to stick it in when this happened right?  You Japanese have killed a lot of horses. The horses was very evil.  How many chapter's have been translated for this?       cut out loli sexualization <br>Sasuga A-1.</br>  <br>I only see how that is suffering for the one stuck having to watch.</br>  <br> made the loli older <br> made the teen younger <br>I am quite confused by this</br></br></br>  I want more translated manga.  So why do they have zero air support?  <br> panache in alnus <br>fuck</br></br>  <br><br>Filthy secondary quints.</br></br>  I just realized all the niggers in reddit who kept repeating this anti-american angle in all gate threads came from neogaf.  <br>wasted get, read the fucking manga</br>  <br> reddit <br>And I should care why?</br></br>  <br>That's a crime against the emperor. Oh wait it wasn't a white horse but a brown horse.</br>  <br>They're probably here too.</br>  <br>#BrownLivesMatter</br>  <br> dat lip </br>    <br>Did he slap her?</br>      <br>Because their MCV wouldn't pass trough the gate so they have to set up their air fields the hard way.</br>  I'd panzerfaust her in the face. If you know what I mean.    <br>this anon got it. You might be able to fit in fighters in there, but you'd have to assemble larger ones like bombers on site.</br>  <br>through the gate they bringed several Apache, Cobra,F4, Black Hawks and Chinook<br>they don't need anything else</br></br>  <br>I think he elbowed he shoulder.</br>  <br>Why no planes as big as bombers? I mean, yeah, they don't need it, but damn, it would be so fucking cool when they see an AC-130E and call it an "Iron Dragon" that "breathes huge explosive fireball from its side."</br>  <br>Come on, Lieutenant! I want some of that action!</br>  <br> shut up Kurata, you get a lot of monster girls action later and a catgirl girlfriend </br>  <br><br>I'm starting to like her too though.</br></br>   Itami has the same VA as Dandy <br>Didn't notice it until this episode. <br>It's only going to make me like the show more.</br></br>  <br>Is she gonna die, raped or what?</br>  <br>But I'm already half solid!</br>  <br>they have low budget</br>  <br>That explains them complaining about their guns being old, but weren't they backed by the US?</br>  <br>The US just gifted them some ammo,fuel and i think few humvee<br>Still the nip gov thinks there is no reason to put a lot of money considering the enemy tech.</br></br>  <br><br>Itami is a Dandy guy...</br></br>  <br>Rory a cute. A CUTE.</br>  <br>Yeah, I don't think they need to send in that much weapons, seeing that just a lowly anti-tank can destroy a dragon's arm. But it would be damn epic to see maybe their F-15 performing a flyby, then breaks sound barrier, breaking the glass in their castles.</br>    How did MC learn their language?<br><br>Im pretty sure the book he has doesnt have Jap translations</br></br>  <br>The JSDF wouldn't use sex slaves for stress relief purpose</br>  I need more of her.  <br>They have 6k prisoner in japan, someone must had been more cooperative than others</br>  <br><br>POW's.</br></br>  <br>:^)</br>    <br>It's not slavery if the elf charges you.</br>  <br>They had like 6 months and a fuck load of POW's. Learning the language would be top priority for commanders, not sure about grunts</br>  <br> paying an elf whore <br> not just rape her <br>You are a disgrace for your family lad.</br></br></br>  <br> But it would be damn epic to see maybe their F-15 performing a flyby, then breaks sound barrier <br>You're gonna be a happy anon then.</br></br>  <br> rape <br> lad <br>enjoying your summer holidays kiddo?</br></br></br>  ...so, why did they tone down the violence and edginess so much compared to the manga?<br>It went from extremely edgy to uguuu kawai moe.</br>  <br>This show just keeps getting better and better, this is 26 episodes right?</br>  <br><br>My problem with the anime is the shit character designs.<br><br>Kuribayashi is supposed to be 35, and they made her a fucking keion.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kuribayashi is 24 though?</br>  <br>no, probably early,  anime could make to the dragon death </br>  <br>It seems as if the director's got his priorities right. Pace is fast and on point, only seems slow because of all the real world military SOPs they have to go through and them being covered through dialogue since normies wouldn't get it.<br><br>As for the gore, it's not the manga. Literally only mangafags are complaining about this shit.<br> uguuu kawai moe <br>Haven't seen niggers call Itami "onii-chan" or act cute with their hands balled cutely in front of them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> this is 26 episodes right <br>I believe they announced it'll be 24.</br></br>  <br><br>My bad then.

Because he's Lelouch without super powers  <br>Considering this is anime, I'm fairly certain that A-TEC will get their budget and place back. <br><br>As much as the other faggots in this thread want them to die, they'll probably persevere. <br><br>Faggots:<br> <br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe they'll stay but with a much smaller and more efficient budget?</br>  <br>He's 18.</br>  <br>I think I can see this plot more clearly now: A-TEC only isn't the real problem here, it's more like an excuse. None of the department chiefs knew about the budget cut, and the money is probably going to someone's own pocket(Nagisa's brother). Nagisa will team up with Sera and A-TEC to go against his brother. <br><br>Also, in episode 1 the employees in the mines were having a riot(blowing up equipment and taking Nagisa as hostage) because there was problems with payment. I think this might be related to the money case as well.</br></br></br>  <br>Nagisa wants A-TEC to survive though.

Or does that mean none of our parents love us since they let us fend for ourselves when we're of age?

Chinese scans for FT Zero are floating around as well.  We have a new name for Lumen Histoire.  <br>Post the PLOT</br>  <br>There's not all that much of it. Just this chick.</br>  Makarov has 9 lives. When is that old nigga going to die?  The 6 universal faces of shounen mysterious and supposedly strong bad guys:<br>1. Smuggles McHaughty<br>2. The I JUST WANT A GOOD FIGHT guy<br>3. The nihilist<br>4. The wise old man<br>5. The doll collector<br>6. The sadist<br><br>Have I missed anyone?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  They better remove the censor in the DVD version.   rescue arc avoided <br><br>Wasn't expecting that so soon. They really could just go back home if they wanted to but Natsu is probably going to fuck up.</br></br>  <br>Mashima's never really been big on "rescue arcs". For him, someone being captured is usually just an excuse to go to the enemy's base, spring the captured person, and start wrecking stuff.</br>  <br>Yep and again hiro fails to kill off makarov</br>  <br>I still think he's going to die before its over. Its the safest 'big death' he can pull. He's probably saving it for when Laxus shows up again.</br>  <br>What censor? Or do you not like black panties?</br>  <br><br>Wait, I somehow managed to completely forget about the cover page for the magazine.</br></br>  <br> dem hips <br>I wonder if Mashima's wife ever gets mad at him for drawing such immaculate female specimens every time.</br></br>  <br>Black panties that don't show her butt cheek lines or cameltoe? Plus pure maidens have white panties.</br>   I'm going to kill people so Natsu gets mad enough to kill me <br><br>Dat edge. But really is Zeref or Acno the end villain?</br></br>  <br>Shockingly, panties aren't always tiny.</br>  <br><br>FT is notorious for this kind of shit. Every time there's a big plot point building and you think it'll take awhile to complete, it's over in less than 3 issues.</br></br>  <br>No way it's Acnologia. It's either Zeref or some final out-of-the-blue Kaguya type villain.</br>  <br>You seem to be implying this is going to end once those two are defeated.</br>  <br>Sometimes its better this way. If it were Bleach they wouldn't have found Makarov until next year.</br>  <br> Catches Erza off guard and wraps her up in her finger things <br> Lets her go so she can fight back instead of pounding her while she's helpless <br><br>Kyouka a bad</br></br></br></br>  <br>I understand, but it's a fan service shot; of course it should cater to fans expectations. It's alright though, I'll have the image fixed within a week or two.</br>  <br> Fairy Heart <br><br>so, Mashima will finally outshine Kubo</br></br></br>  <br> Zeref is defeated and fading away <br> Mavis is there <br> Mavis do you hate me? <br> No <br> Ah is see this is a Fairy's Heart </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The old man isn't a Spriggan <br><br>Also doesn't Orgast (old 12) look kinda like the old man raregroove from rave?<br><br> yfw he blows up a town with meteors </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's also a clean version of Natsu and Lucy floating around for some reason.</br>  <br>Now that's a pleasant surprise!<br><br><br>okay.png<br><br><br>I'd pound her while she's helpless, if you know what I mean.<br><br><br>Noice</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Here's the link for the FT Zero 13 chinese scans.<br><br>http://www.jojoft.com/ocomic/other/<wbr>FTZERO/13.html<br><br>Most notably it includes a future timeline with some interesting tidbits.<br><br> X690 May - Yuri gets married<br>X696 March - Makarov is born<br>X697 - Mavis "dies"<br>X700 - Yuri dies<br>X731 - Precht's interest in black magic begins. Warrod retires.<br><br>So Mavis was officially 24 when she died/was turned into Lumen Histoire, whatever. Yuri got married when he was 23, Makarov was born 6 years later when he was 29, and he died at age 33 when Makarov was 4 years old. </br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>   Gray and Natsu back to normal clothes <br> girls still in swimsuits <br>Das sexist<br><br>...N-No more Angel?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Whats the scratched out part on 697? Mavis' cause of death?</br>  <br>Yeah. According to the translations floating around, the part that explains what happened to Mavis is scratched out, and the part right after the scratched out part is just about her grave being built on Tenrou Island.</br>  <br> Mavis was officially 24 when she died/was turned into Lumen Histoire, whatever <br>Does this mean I can safely fap to Mavis without feeling like a pedophile?</br></br>  <br> I'd pound her while she's helpless, if you know what I mean. <br><br>pls explain</br></br></br>  <br>You can fap to anyone you want without feeling like a pedophile if that is what floats your boat.</br>  <br>I suppose. She's definitely an adult. She basically just stunted her growth when she was 13. Leaving her short, with small breasts.</br>  <br>The I'm fighting for a evil but necessary cause but isn't all that evil after all</br>   Spriggan <br>I had forgotten that some of these names actually mean something.<br><br><br>I hoped at least he wouldn't die here. I hate when they do that, when a character goes missing, then they find him dead.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I doubt it. Mashima's fanservice doesn't really run towards panty shots. Hence skirts conveniently covering between the legs like this. Though I think the most notable was back during the Kain fight where Lucy's skirt defied gravity to keep her covered up.</br>  On another note, volume 50 is out, so art from that is starting to surface.  <br>Well...</br>  <br>Doesn't he love humans despite saying that, also the main reason why he created all those demons is to kill himself.</br>  Where is team B ? I want the funny dorks not the edgy coolkids.  <br>Dat Porlyusca.<br><br>Also,link to the vol 50 chibis that previous thread's faggot  totallynotme  forgot to post.<br><br>http://lucy-heartflawless.tumblr.co<wbr>m/post/124338415707/for-the-launch-<wbr>of-volume-50-of-the-manga-mashima<br><br>http://lucy-heartflawless.tumblr.co<wbr>m/post/124340078767/50-cards-made-f<wbr>or-hiro-mashima-first-25<br><br><br>Based FT team censoring.Better than light beams.DARKNESS is superior after all.</br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So lewd.</br>  <br>No, by his conversation with Mavis, most humans piss him off.</br>  Nanatsu no Taizai when?  <br> image <br><br>Something something Gumball.</br></br></br>  <br>Having to deal with human stupidity all those centuries, it's no wonder he thinks that</br>  <br>more like Fairy YEAAARRT amirite</br>  Is Zeref actually Gerard? I'm having trouble following why this nigga keeps showing up everywhere.  These last chapters are really looking like the end of Fairy Tail.  <br>And nothing of value will have been lost.</br>  <br> Zeref's army is defeated in this new kingdom <br> Oops sorry Zeref is in another castle <br> Fairy Tail goes to fight him in the next kingdom over <br> Repeat forever </br></br></br></br>  How can a Loli have such wide hips? My dick.  <br><br> Yep and again hiro fails to kill off makarov <br>Makarov will only die for real if Mashima has the balls to perma kill Jellal as well, but we all know that ain't happening. So I wouldn't get your hopes up in expecting the old man to even be dead when the end of series epilogue comes around.</br></br></br>  <br>Mavis is such a semen demon</br>  <br>Why couldn't they?<br>Are you discriminating against lolis on what they can have?</br></br>  <br>Nah. Makarov is an old man. Mashima can kill him off anytime.</br>  Is there an end in sight with this shit?<br>I really thought it was comming in the last arc when the dragons were kill, but no..<br>Do anyone here predict this will be the final arc before E.N.D and Zerefs death?<br>I dont dare do that anymore.<br>Shits gonna go for another 5 years, atleast.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It ends if the readers don't read it anymore.</br>  <br>Zeref was always hinted at to be the end (no pun intended) boss of this. The last chapter makes it sound like after the Spriggan arc there'll be an Acnologia war arc. That... should be it.<br><br>I cannot think of anything else that would happen after that. Except maybe Lector being killed by Grey and the secret 10 year mission that Gildartz was away on during the beginning of the series.</br></br></br>  This is probably the worst written arc of all of Fairy Tail, and considering Mashima's writing history that's a fucking accomplishment.<br><br> Lucy is pissed at Natsu for leaving, which could actually lead to some development between the two, yet it's ignored once FT gets back together <br> Juvia instantly forgives Grey for leaving her <br> Aquarius' broken key has yet to be mentioned once, which is pretty significant considering it's been mentioned multiple times that SOMETHING happens when all 12 keys get together <br> One year timeskip, Lucy gets new ability and is STILL the weakest of the group <br> A God is introduced and one-shotted <br> Explanation for why Ishgar has doomsday weapons, which could lead to some interesting worldbuilding, but it's actually just Zeref's country <br> Despite dragons showing up, still no implications as to wtf Layla had to do with them <br> Zeref's curse explained, which could involve the Gods and lead to more arcs involving them, yet primarily ignored for this three-way battle about to happen <br> Everything is rushed- they make it to the capitol of this supposedly menacing country without any problem <br><br>There's still a shit-ton of loose ends and I have the feeling they're gonna stay unexplained for the whole "muh Natsu vs Zeref vs Acnologia" battle, which should be the finale after the loose ends are tied up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Lector beeing killed by Grey has already been prevented now, hasnt it, so whats there to explore there?<br>Gildartz was probably hunting down Acnologia or some shit like that, which should only be some flashback chapters at best.</br></br>  <br>fuck off to a forum, cancer</br>  <br> Everything is rushed- they make it to the capitol of this supposedly menacing country without any problem <br>I'm not saying you're wrong, but do we REALLY want another infiltration arc? The Edolas arc was the worst arc of the series by far.<br><br><br>Yeah, sorry, my bad. You're right on both accounts. I guess that's it then.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Juvia instantly forgives Grey for leaving her <br><br><br>Batter housewife syndrome is good writing though<br><br> One year timeskip, Lucy gets new ability and is STILL the weakest of the group <br>Well did you expect her to get strong</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>While it was nice of that person to post them, they apparently didn't manage to find the best quality ones currently available.</br>  <br><br>Sadly Natsu, Lucy, Happy, Erza, Wendy, Charle, Gajeel, and Pantherlily aren't available in much better quality than they posted. <br><br>Fortunately the rest are available in somewhat better quality, courtesy of some Chinese fan.</br></br></br></br>    Post Fairy Plot with a side serving of fairy feet.            <br> that heart shaped exposure <br>3lewd5me</br></br>            <br> new name  <br>Another name we can give is Dues Ex Machina.</br></br>                              <br>I don't know how Lucy could be that mad at Natsu when the guild was disbanded a day later and everyone else left anyway. I also didn't expect Juvia to stay mad at Gray but she should have been more involve at least, when she came back.</br>                                <br>My little villain can't be this cute!<br><br> I also have hard time remembering some of these characters, some I can't recognize at all. Is my memory just shit or is FT cast so forgettable? </br></br></br>    <br>Gray + clothes?<br><br>Have ever even read this manga before?</br></br></br>  <br>Goddamit, how can a single girl be so best?</br>    <br>wow lucy is such a fucking demon look at that body</br>    <br>Hairy Fart.</br>  <br>She's a whore, just like her VA.</br>    <br> Makarov is an old man. Mashima can kill him off anytime. <br>Like I said, I'll only believe it when Mashima perma kills some other character who's death would cause an impact like Jellal or even Gildartz as well.<br><br> I cannot think of anything else that would happen after that <br>Mashima named dropped that God who cursed Zeref again this chapter. So I'm thinking he's planning on making that God the Final Villain and will redeem Zeref during this arc or the next. Well, that is, unless Mashima uses Zeref to kill a big name character for real this time then he'll probably be killed or maybe die protecting Natsu.</br></br></br></br></br>        <br>And this is the last one.</br>  <br> Defending FT <br> Calling other people cancer </br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Fuck! I can't get into chibified art because if these were in normal style, I'd be set for awhile.<br><br>Almost that Mashima accidentally drew Natsu with Blue hair for a second.<br><br>I guess Mard does give off a laid-back feel enough to make him some rich guy who likes to vacation in the tropics.<br><br>This almost feels like foreshadowing for what could happen to Sorano this arc since she, Jellal and Crime Sorcerie will try to kill Zeref themselves.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I wouldn't worry about it being foreshadowing. <br><br>Yukino's cosplaying a nurse <br>Sorano's cosplay a patient <br><br>That's likely all there is to it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess this fanservice will have to do. Hope for more Lucy and Angel next week.</br>  <br>End villain will be the god that cursed zeref.</br>  <br>Where do I get the collection for all these.</br>  <br>Well, you could say, that even Yukino being a nurse is just as suspect. I mean it'd kinda make sense for her to help care for her sister after such an event happened.<br><br>But yeah you're probably right and that Mashima just felt like drawing them with that theme.</br></br></br>  <br>Which will be the Edolas version of Zeref's brother.</br>  <br>For making babies.</br>  <br>I hope this semen demon returns.<br><br>Chances on her brother not being dead and or being revived to mindfuck her and Erza, Jellal?<br><br>There is also that card and block guy from tower of heaven arc. The block guy is that one dudes brother from oracion seis.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Natsu is just some shitty car driver in Edolas.</br>  <br> Lorg <br>???</br></br>  <br>Must be horrible Engrish. It's different from the name Gajeel knew him as too.</br>  <br>Lorg is really cute.</br>  <br>It makes for good pacing, at least.</br>  <br>On Simon not being dead? Pretty much zero. Mashima's reluctant to kill off characters in Fairy Tail, but not that reluctant, and there's fair too much drama attached to it now, plus too much time has passed for it to possibly be executed well. <br><br>Chances on him being revived to screw with people's minds? Also pretty much zero. Mashima hates the idea of genuinely resurrecting characters. That's why we get stuff like Lisanna's death being retconned. It's why we get so many unconfirmed villain deaths, he's leaving just enough wiggle room to bring them back later if he really wants to do so. That's why Silver was some kind of undead. <br><br>Plus Simon's body should have been destroyed along with the tower. Which really limits the ways he could come back.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You forget that Zeref will just use edo tensei.</br>  <br>There does not seem to have been double checking for what the official english names are there. It's not a problem for most of them, as the names are fairly well standardized, if different in a couple cases from what the fan translations prefer. But that leaves a few with like Charle being the original Charles, and Rogue apparently had someone try to romanize his name at some point at Lorg. I'm guessing a native English speaker had a word with someone fairly early on about that one, but the weird romanization was left to float around and crop up here.</br>  Did you like the new opening and ending songs?  No and no  The first ending was great, it managed to get me hyped for the next episode every time. This one is just "fine"  ED visulas were saved thanks to based Nao.  Its decent but I loved the old ED especially the ending of it.  Opening is better but ending song is alright.  SHIT they changed the OP and ED?<br><br>I accidently conditioned myself to eat a specific meal while watching this show. <br><br>I freak out if i dont watch the Op while eating.</br></br></br></br>  The OP is really good<br>Especially the part where Megumi orgasms while tomatoes are raining</br>  I feel the new OP fits really well for all the stuff that's going to happen soon.  Not nearly as much as the previous OP/ED. Good episode though, I'm hyped as shit for next one  <br> being this autistic </br>  <br>Didn't like the songs for either, but liked the visuals of the new ED.</br>   They replaced the glorious first opening with this shit. <br>WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYY.</br>  They're really good. The last ED was overrated as hell, the only good part of it was the changing faces every episode.  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ERINA!  I've never watched the entire OP for this show  <br> First opening <br> Glorious <br>It was shit</br></br></br>  I don't understand how anyone could possible prefer the first OP over this one.  Spot the  otp   Full color chapter is out.<br>http://imgur.com/a/8jmzj<br>Shit scans never.</br></br>  <br>If the characters in the ladle indeed change, I figure Isami will be visible then and these guys will be turned around.</br>    <br>All I can see is Hisako's butt and that slutty look on her face like she desperately wants some cock.</br>  I like the new OP, it's kinda spoily for Animeonlyfags tho.    <br>why the fuck is meat in there<br>that makes me mad as fuck</br></br>  <br>Souma's dad beat you to it.</br>  <br>This.<br>Ibusaki and Marui got even a higher score than her.</br></br>  Souma reaching top 5 and Erina moving to the polar star when?  I want Kanon to appear in the festival.<br>A maid cafe would be good too.</br>  <br>she's the love interest</br>  <br>Both OP are ok, but the first one is glorious and for comparision this one is shit.</br>  <br> I want Kanon to appear in the festival. <br><br> Kanon visits Soma's booth <br> Soma and Megumi offer her their food <br> she's all happy seeing them again and eating their food <br> Soma sees Erina passing by <br> "Oi, Nakiri!" <br> Erina and Kanon respond   "Nani?" <br> everyon'es face when </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, the irrelevant one.</br>   There are people that don't pick Yuki   <br>They literally could not have picked a worse ending song. I didn't think i'd be able to hate vocals that bad in an OP/ED song since fear and loathing in Las Vegas</br>  <br><br> no more fuwa fuwa <br><br>Fucking dropped</br></br></br></br>  Holy fuck that voice on whoever sings the ED, what the fuck she sounds pretty annoying  It's the nasally vocals that put people off from the new OP, right? You guys probably don't like Nano Ripe, either.<br><br>I can see why it's a bit of an acquired taste, but I like it.</br></br>  <br>It's better than the last OP, not that that means much</br>  I TOLD YOU ALL<br>I TOLD YOU ERINA AND SOMA ARE SIBLINGS<br>YOU DIDN'T LISTEN</br></br>  <br> animeonlyfags </br>  <br>is anime your autism medicine</br>  <br>animeonlyfags, everybody</br>  <br>They aren't.</br>  <br>are you fucking retarded</br>  <br>ED's not that bad, but the OP is tragic.</br>  <br> Erina <br> living in some dorm like a commoner <br><br>I'd like to see grandpa slap the shit out of her with an eviction to Polar Star</br></br></br></br>  <br>Has her own money. Has a job that pays extremely well. Has connections and high level of business acumen.<br><br>In short order she would buy, remodel, and stock the polar star dorm with servants without even needing her family's money.</br></br></br>  オオオオオオ lives on.  Did they add a lot of anime only scenes or was it just me  Does the new OP mean were going to end at the end of the Autumn Election? Looks like it from the moon. <br>Either way, I'm fucking hype.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3i_<wbr>0j4vFnUk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I dig the ED. You just have to listen to it a few more times.</br></br>  <br>No, we'll get only the preliminaries. Gigga Nigga wasn't even in the OP.</br>  Casanova is out.  <br>Finally.</br>  <br>http://casanovascans.com/read/shoku<wbr>geki_no_soma/en/0/127/page/1<br><br>wow how come so fast compared to last week?</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Because Jump came out early this week for some reason.</br>  <br><br>Was wondering how they would have pulled off like 50chapters, but alright, I'm down. I want the Election to be thoroughly adapted, so let's hope for S2.</br></br>   surstroming  <br><br>jesus christ</br></br>   he does it for free   <br>These lyrics are fucking weird.</br>  <br>The Alice trio scene was great.<br><br>Also, Nao a cute.</br></br></br>  So Ryou with his flattering is like a bad influence for Alice.  What Souma is planning? God damn it, I really want to know. <br>I can't wait for the next chapter.</br>  <br>I just like how he's basically saying "hey, you don't have to mean it, just do it".</br>  why doesn't casanova just put the translations in the full color pages  <br>We still need to know whom he gave a key to and why, along with what's happened with Eizan and Rindou.</br>  <br>Because it's far harder to clean.</br>  <br>It's hell to redraw color pages.</br>  They were both shit. The ending specially so.  <br>I don't know much about that process but I figure redraws are harder?</br>  <br>Yeah. The first OP is one of the worst I ever seen (sound wise)</br>  <br>Hand was mysterious girl from chapter 117.</br>  <br>Probably a man's hand. It was the same size as Souma's and notably larger than Megumi's on the same page.</br>  <br>how do you tell</br>  <br>She was the only background character that wasn't full colored in the color chapter. Same with Yugi and Nene.</br>  So is Souma gonna be able to marry Erina knowing that everytime they fuck, she's gonna be thinking of his dad?  So they skipped the introduction of the AE which means half of the dialogue is going to be original. Gonna be wierd.  I like this OP more. Builds anticipation for the tournament really nicely.<br><br>The ED is okay I guess, but it's no Fura Fura~ and it will take some time for me to stop missing that ED. <br><br>I do like that they featured stalker-chan in it though.</br></br></br></br>   tfw jc staff are doing 2 other shows this season   <br>His goal has always been to beat his old man. On every front.</br>  <br>What if the punishment includes grandpa using HIS connections to get her temporarily blacklisted by her usual clients?</br>  <br>The loli master strikes again</br>  <br><br>Thank you, someone else who can see her charm. It's the same charm as Tomoko, but useful.</br></br>  I only liked the old OP when Soma was singing it drunk.  Hinako and Donato a best.  This series has provided the most lighthearted enjoyment out of any series from at least the last 5 years, if not the last 10.<br><br>It's great, relaxing, interesting, and fun to watch. I love it.</br></br>  I see we got scans of the recipe book's SS today, I'll get started on them right away.  <br>Yeah there's few shows I don't procrastinate on anymore, but even after catching up on the manga I still look forward to new episodes of this.</br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  I like the new OP and how it shows everyone's dishes (I'm sure Ryo's will also be revealed later). The ED is sexy but nowhere near as fun as fura fura. Also, /u/ overload.  <br>I want to make Souma a little half-sister.</br>  Neither songs for OP or ED feel particularly good.<br><br>Visually the OP is pretty nice but I feel like there is too much emphasis on Hayama being the top rival.</br></br>  <br>I think that might only seem the case for mangafags. <br><br>Should ask animefags the impression they got from it.</br></br></br>  <br> Same with Yugi and Nene. <br><br>Maybe that was a rejected design for Rindou.</br></br></br>  How did Ryou get from<br> talk shit after you have more wins against me <br> as usual, your cooking is too pretty but lacking taste <br> you lost because you're too casual <br>to<br> hey currybro, you gotta compliment her first  <br>? <br>And all the first three was said by unbandanaed Ryo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not seeing how that's incompatible.<br>They're competitive, but live together and have to work together, so he learns to grease her wheels when he needs to, so to speak.</br></br>  <br>We know that he is quite competitive so it's no surprise for him to trash-talk in the situation he was in. On the other hand he is quite docile when in butler mode.</br>  <br>He realized the reason his father's recipe loses to Yugi's is because the guy deliberately made it milder since they run a special of the day restaurant. <br><br>Hence there is a way to "complete" the recipe for full spice.</br></br></br>  How do we go from this  <br>to THIS?</br>  <br><br>I don't know but I'm not complaining, that shit was hilarious.</br></br>  <br>I really liked this scene, J.C. Staff did a good job.</br>  I really like how Souma can get along with just about everybody.<br><br>The thought never came to mind about these two meeting but their interactions are pretty funny and has great potential.</br></br>  <br>wait, is the new issue translated? I just caught up and dont remember reading this</br>  <br/>  <br> not yukihihihihihihihihira </br>  <br>thank you friend</br>  <br>I wish she smiled more.</br>  <br>So the bandannas do nothing?</br>  <br>They lower the salt content of the dishes.</br>  <br>It's just his full gear.</br>  <br>looking fey there, Donato</br>  Would you cut your vegetables on this chopping board?  seriously, I thought by this far in Souma would have already made the elite 10. I suppose its more interesting to have him struggle some, but how long can they keep it going?  <br>He'll probably get in in his second year.</br>  <br>the first year will end soon, the top 5 E10 will graduate and there will be 5 spots open.<br>being top 3 Souma will get into E10 easily.</br></br>  <br>What if skill is not the prime requirement and instead it is influence? You win Shokugekis, increase your resources and then when you have the pull, you get into the E10?</br>  I'm really hoping they have a new ED every week focusing on another character/relationship from the Elections. <br><br> Hayama's Oedipus complex <br> Alice/Ryou childhood Shokugekis <br> Takumi/Meat 'Tsundere off' <br> Giganigga    version of Spice where he replaces every character  </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then he will also get into the E10 easily.</br>  <br> I thought by this far in Souma would have already made the elite 10. <br>why? You did notice that except for the freak of nature that is Erina, that they are all upperclassmen right?</br></br>  <br> new ED every week <br>That's a tall order, bub.<br>Do you want a full new themed song every week, too?</br></br></br>  <br>well one of the purpose of the the autumn election is to rank the first year students.<br>but there will surely be an arc about selecting the new E10, there will only be speculations until then.</br></br>  <br>Bleach did that shit for all 13 divisions back in season two or something.<br>It is rare but we can always have hope.</br></br>  <br> Takumi with some slut he just talked like two times. <br> Not his fucking brother. <br><br>Anon pls.</br></br></br></br>  <br> the first year will end soon <br><br>Not really, the training camp was just some weeks after the start of the school year, the Autumn election was almost immediately after that and now we're in the Moon Banquet, the last event of said Autumn.<br>Sometimes I wonder if the series is even going to cover the second year.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it has only been about 6 months then? <br>I am retarded.</br></br>  We don't know how the rankings are done. Is it all through Shokugekis for position? Then the higher ranked would never have a reason to accept a challenge with a lower rank unless the lower rank gambled something so risky that getting a higher rank wouldn't be worth it. It would still happen that way, but it would be less frequent, and losing would cost your seat at least.<br><br>It's probably ranked primarily off regular events like the election.</br></br>  <br>Should be early november, since that's when these festivals take place. The leaf viewing a few weeks back in Oct.<br><br>School year wraps up in early March with 3rd years graduating. Before then, there's also winter break for a couple of weeks.<br><br>There's around 4 months left for the school year.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Also SHAFT just did it for Nisekoi.</br></br>  <br>DEEP LORE</br>  <br>How? He doesn't really have much to offer. Sure, he's beaten a lot of people in Shokugekis, but all he took was knowledge. For groups willing to give their assistance, all I can think of is the Don RS and the Polar Star Dorm. Compare the current E10 that we know of.<br><br>Isshiki has a company and is more or less the defacto student for the Polar Star Dorm. Eizan has ihs businesses and his groupies and Kuga has won enough Shokugekis to become in charge of one of the biggest RS in the academy. Then you have Erina with all fo her own personal cooking facilities and her money from God Tongue.</br></br></br>  <br> Not putting the tsundere's together <br><br>No anon, you pls.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I'm all aboard putting two tsunderes together!</br></br>  <br>He gains reputation, which seems like a pretty good kind of currency to have in Tootsuki since everyone worth a shit is out for glory and recognition. Then he can get challenges just for having a good record and get stuff that way. I'm sure you're not absolutely REQUIRED to have an outside business going or something of the sort to be in the elite 10.</br>  <br> Since Takumi is aware of girls I wonder what is the type he likes </br>  <br><br>That's better than I could've imagined myself, it's things like this that justify watching the anime adaptation.</br></br>  Did Alice change her mind because of what Ryou said (she became aware of his consideration for her all this time) or what Hayama said (finally someone tells it to her like it is)? The big panel of her serious expression before Ryou starts speaking seem to indicate the latter.  <br>Pretty sure it was because of Hayama.</br>  <br>I just didnt think they would put so many challenges between him and the goal, since early on he seems so gifted I was surprised when they introduced so many people in the frist years besides Erina who could challenge him. I thought he would quickly reach her level.</br>  <br>I can see it happening, especially when she's rich and enrolled in a class handled by a 7th seat</br>  <br>She's not stupid.</br>  <br>Anyone who his nii-chan approves probably.</br>   Tadokoro, I'm sorry, but we might be sleeping a bit less from today on. <br>L-lewd.</br>  <br>So will she also be in the elite 10 or will she use her newly discovered skills to follow him around like an assistant?</br>  <br> since early on he seems so gifted <br>We already know that's not the case. It's gonna cost him some blood to reach the top.</br></br>  <br>yeah we knew that later on when his dad explained it, we didnt know it if the first few chapters</br>  <br>I like to think it was because of both.</br>  So with J.C Staff skipping the Karrage arc in the anime entirely, how will they show Soma's conflict with Eizen?  <br><br>Am I seeing a potential new ship?</br></br>  <br> mangapanda </br>  <br>Probably will get OVA'd</br>  <br> inb4 Gigganigga doesn't exists, they replace him with Nikumi. </br>  <br>I just want to know how the ending of the anime will ruin everything</br>  <br>I will fucking laugh if Hayama wins the Alicebowl.</br>  is next chapter going to be the final day of the moon festival? I remember reading it would last only 3 days, but I might be wrong  <br>Maybe, but then what hope is there for a second season if they're skipping manga content? <br><br>Episode 15 ends at Chapter 41. With 127 chapters out as of today, there's more than enough for 3 seasons already (If it were to ever get more than 1)</br></br></br>  <br>5 days.</br>  <br>I think that is the problem with the current 12-24 season set up. They have to chop the series up in a way that doesn't always work. anime original ending usually suck too</br>  <br>Hayama. Mind you it's not like what he's saying would be new to her, but rather it's reminding her that she's been doing all of this for the wrong reasons.<br><br>After all, Alice wasn't even planning to take part in the festival in the first place. Which is why she ended up having to talk her way into Hayama's booth. She just decided to do so on a whim because "Yukihira was getting all the attention" with his challenge against Kuga. Even in this chapter, we can see that she was trying to craft a dish to make a splash, rather than one that made financial sense.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe he'll use Pacific Saury, like they did in the final.<br>Or he'll use some ideas from Ryou and Hayama from their last dish in the election.<br><br>Or it's the Mezzaluna used in some way.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hayama wins the Alicebowl. <br><br>No.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nigger the anime already explains that the head of the school is Erina's father so it isn't an animeonlyfaggot, he's just a fucking retard like you guys.</br></br>  <br>It'll happen anon, Kurokiba is just a beta orbiter white knight. She'll obviously choose the alpha black man who treats her like shit in the end.</br>  <br>Meant to say grandfather</br>  <br> calling them fucking retards <br> he thinks that Senzaemon is Erina's father </br></br>  <br>/r9k/ pls go</br>  <br> the anime already explains that the head of the school is Erina's father <br><br>no anon, you are the retard</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe Kurokiba can get with  Hisako </br>  but who was mum?  <br> dirtying Hisako with curry <br>Disgusting faggot.</br></br>  Why does the anime make me like Yoshinon and Ryoko so much more than when I read the manga?  <br>I say Kurokiba faggot.</br>  SA<br>CHAN<br>SEKSHY CURRYYYYYYYYYYYY</br></br>  <br>But he already tried going all out with spiciness in his experiments.</br>  <br>My apologies<br> dirtying Hisako with a disgusting Scandinavian ricenigger </br></br>  Reminder Megumi and the other two girls from polar will crave for Souma's dick at the end of the series  <br>Ryoko x Smoke is pretty much canon</br>  Feels like NTR almost.  <br><br>I already corrected myself here  faggots.</br></br>  <br>Is Megumi not thinking lewd thoughts?</br>  Holy fuck how many seasons will the anime need to catch up to the manga?  <br>3</br>  <br><br><br>Honestly, this is one of the best adaptations I have ever seen. I love it entirely. Stuff like this is amazing.</br></br></br>  <br> 3 <br><br>Fuck, I wonder how long that'll take to finish</br></br></br>  <br>Around 3. <br><br>Episode 15 ended with Chapter 41.</br></br></br>  <br>they could do it in 2 if they really butchered it</br>  <br>The anime is doing a better job fleshing them out earlier and keeping them involved/relevant</br>  <br>a certain website told me its full of alot of fanservice which really takes away from it</br>  <br>They already butchered it by skipping out on an arc.<br><br><br> Full of fanservice <br>Have you not even read the fucking manga?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Which arc was that? The one where soma goes back to his restrurant for summer? Or is that following up?</br>  <br><br>the early chapters were full of fanservice that brought everyone into it.

The anime adaption has literally cut out Chapters 35, 36, 37, 38 and 39 and meshed Episode 15 together by adapting Chapters 34 and 41.<br><br>I can understand why it was cut because it's just showing what Soma and Nakiri got up to during their summer holiday. The problem is it introduces Eizan where he plans to crush Soma later down the line. <br><br>The question is, why bother skipping an arc when;<br><br>a). There's more than enough manga material to create at least 3, 2-cour seasons.<br><br>b). There was only 10 episodes left after episode 14 which wouldn't even cover all the preliminary's of the Autumn Election meaning it would of been left on a cliffhanger ending anyway.<br><br>An anime-only opening is literally possible at this point, which I don't think anyone wants.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Souma: Either’s fine, she said. // I guess I look good in a jacket OR blazer! <br><br>That selective hearing.</br></br></br>  <br>They might just be moving it. It won't be the first out of order thing either, like Megumi's garden.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Thank you very much. Also many thanks to the anon who either scanned or found it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you haven't noticed, Souma has a big ego</br>  <br>I have the feeling they're gonna butcher the elections quite hard. No preliminary round, no Giga Nigga, matches out of camera and such.</br>  The only way to redeem the new OP is the episode after Giganigga is revealed(or his mimicry) they also reveal that the meat in the OP was him all along.  <br> An anime-only opening is literally possible at this point, which I don't think anyone wants <br><br>Let's hope this anon's cousin <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127207137  wasn't trolling.</br></br></br>  <br>The new OP is fine<br>That ED on the other hand...</br></br>  OP 2 &gt; OP 1<br>ED1 &gt; ED2</br>  <br><br>what I meant to say is that I don't think they'll omit the arc entirely. They'll just move the karaage arc right after jouichiro's arc, around the end of chapter 46 (the short break before the election)</br></br>  <br>I just can't look at meat in the top 9. It disgusts me.</br>  <br>The new Opening does the manga justice. <br><br>The manga had that serious tension during the Autumn Election arc and it was pretty cool to see it animated in the opening. <br><br><br>The new opening hinted at Soma vs Kurokiba vs Hayama with the moon visible in the stadium so Giganiga must be in.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  http://casanovascans.com/read/shoku<wbr>geki_no_soma__etoile/en/0/2/page/7<br><br>god damn, this whole chapter... Hinako and Shinomiya are such a OTP it hurts.</br></br></wbr>  <br>No for both but the new op does set the mood for the elections. Ed is just shit.</br>  <br>Poor Fuyumi, Senpai will never choose her.</br>  <br> Hinako crying on the swings <br>;_;</br></br>  <br>Hinako truly is best girl</br>  <br>Schoolgirl Hinako is so cute. they better end up together, they're a cute couple.</br>  <br>How good is your conversational Nip, Royal-kun?<br><br>Thanks for the TL, btw.</br></br></br>  <br>This. Didn't feel anything for both, first ED was good.</br>   changing that epic ED   <br>You're welcome. I'm a native speaker and Japanese is my first language. Can't write kanji by hand for shit, but thankfully everything is typed these days.  Sage for off-topic. </br>  <br>I thought the dark under Ryou's eyes were eye bags, not some silly war paint. Now he just looks dumb</br>  <br>Too pure.</br>  I hope that the way you get into the elite 10 after graduation leaves empty slots is by some sort of tournament  I like the new ED<br>  Giganigga version when? </br>  Look at how happy they are. It's sublime.  <br><br>Hinako was too adorable in this episode</br></br>  <br> everything is decided by tournaments <br>You know what would be cool? If the main cast were divided into teams of five and competed in a challenge, like in Hell's Kitchen. Blind taste tests, cook a three-course meal in 45 minutes with random ingredients X, Y, and Z, etc.<br><br> the Moon Banquet Festival is like that <br>Not really, everyone's off doing their own thing. A random team-up would be nice for a change, like Souma + Nao + Isami + Yuuki. Or Megumi + Giganigga + Alice + Smoker.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>This really makes me wish Soma and Erina has a more active approach in their rivalry. Seeing them try to best each other in a cooking battle in this extra chapter is fun to watch. I do love what we have though with Soma doing the teasing to annoy Erina but I'd really much like it if the two finally face each other off. Then again, that would mean Erina fully embracing the fact he's a threat and Soma seeing her as an opponent other than "Oi, Nakiri!" or some shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  Just started watching the latest episode, dropping by just to say OP1 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; OP2  <br><br> entire thing is an otherworldly depiction of a shotacon's wet dream </br></br>  <br>They'll get there eventually. My money is on the aftermath of Yugi's inevitable defeat and Souma joining the Elites.</br>  <br>But Erina is E10, Soma is a scrub compared to her right now.</br>  <br>They are eyebags. They could have made it gradients instead of following the manga style exactly.</br>    <br>Eh, Eizan got sidelined quietly anyway in the tournament. The plot point of Giga being his lackey is underdeveloped.</br>  <br>Too bad there won't be anymore of these.</br>  <br> native <br> can't write by hand </br></br>  <br>This episode was slow as fuck. The OP and ED aren't anywhere near as good a previous.</br>  <br>I hope the ladle characters change in the new one. Otherwise Isami and Hayama are screwed, and we won't know what kind lewd activity the buttbuddies are up to.</br>  <br>Doubt it. Nao's only interested in Erina and Hisako in the first place to scoop them with the ladle.</br>      <br>Why is meat even on this image?</br>  I think we can all agree that Megumi is best girl, and it's not close.  <br>yes</br>  <br> Megumi <br> Best girl </br></br>  <br>NO</br>  <br>Nigga try harder</br>  <br> erina <br> good <br>worst girl</br></br></br>  <br>She's an uptight cunt.</br>   people say something good about Megumi <br> "fuck off mehgoomyfag" <br> people say something bad about Erina <br> "fuck off secondary" <br> "read the manga" <br> "lol animeonlyfag" <br><br>I hear circlejerking is a big thing in reddit. I want Erinafags to go there since I'm sure you'll like it there!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thought it was quite simple really. Just stuff the mapo tofu in the bun?</br>  <br><br>I am investing in the future, anons.<br><br>I got a feeling the ooey-gooey center of this tsundere-pop will be  orgasmic .</br></br></br></br>  <br>'no'</br>  <br>erinafags are the worst faggots</br>    <br><br>What do people see in Meat?<br><br>I love brown girls but she's one of the worse of their kind. It's shameful. She's shown nothing but be a one-dimensional tsundere. If Erina shows the worse kind of "tsun", Meat is the worst kind of "dere."<br><br>Doesn't help she doesn't bring any sort of value in recent story arcs. And Tsukuda does not want to show her developments since joining the Don RS cause that would be something interesting to see for her character but nope, whenever she's around, we gotta show her lusting for Soma's dick. At least Megumi had a lot of it with her during the camp event and the Autumn Election but even then Megumi still feels like she hasn't changed.<br><br>This is why I feel like Erina's development will be shit. Tsukuda makes fun characters but development doesnt' seem like something of his strong suit. He did it right with Shinomiya and more or less Soma but even for Soma, I still don't feel like I've seen his "speciality" he developed in Stagiare.<br><br>Am I missing something? I feel like I want to appreciate the "changes" these characters go through but I'm not seeing it. I don't want to see stagnation with these colorful characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>In comparison to most other so called best girls she is, but I'm still going with no because you said it.</br></br>  <br> people like different things than me <br> i cant understand this <br>nice worthless post</br></br></br>  <br>So, what's the deal with these two, why are they always together?</br>  <br><br>It's alright to have bad taste, anon. Just don't forget you have bad taste to begin with and learn to live with it.<br><br>Meat is a horrible and shallow character that has no value whatsover than being an onahole of the cast. If that's how her fans ultimately see her then that just proves how bad she is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>ED2 is shit and OP2 isn't better than previous OP</br>  <br>couple</br>  What tags do you think Hisako considered showing to Erina before ultimately deciding on non-h?  *tips chefs hat*  <br>I bet he hear nothin while staring at those dem titties</br>  <br>Ryou is Alice's aide. She picked him up in Denmark when they were young.</br>  <br>I don't know why I spent a minute in paint to do this.</br>  <br>And you didn't even try and get doubles with it, what a waste.</br>  How cute  <br>s-sorry</br>    <br>BASED</br>  <br>winrar</br>    <br> Hes like a pimp <br>kek</br></br>   That shonen as fuck OP <br>Shokugeki no Soma is a cooking manga</br>    <br>skirts that show ankles</br>   all appearances of Hayama was just him sniffing shit <br>I get that it's his edge, but he needs rehab</br>  <br>I knew it</br>  <br>I want them to feed Erina</br>    <br> Surströmming <br>Best girl.<br><br>I ororiginally thought that would be Ryoko's thing if anyone's, but over time it became apparent her thing isn't fermentation in general but mostly that koji stuff or whatever. I feel dumb I didn't consider Nao a candidate until now.</br></br></br></br>  <br> a certain website told me its full of alot of fanservice which really takes away from it <br>Let me guess. Its ANN.</br></br>  So Erina walks into a bar, and got served by the Yukihiras' top ten  <br><br><br> People getting along is considered a self sustained ship <br><br>Nigga, that's not even a raft</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I find it in Tsukuda to make her actually enjoy them despite how they are in the series. For comical reasons.<br><br>If there's anyone who's going to like them for the first time ever, it's her.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So the crazier you are, the better you get along with Souma?</br></br>  <br>karaage arc was shit, though. so i'm glad they skipped it.</br>  Soon. Annoying that the torrents for 96-97 have no seeds though, will have to read through batoto instead   idea seeing the moon <br>he's going to make yukihira-style mochi isn't he</br>  LN anon hasn't come back. TL are kill.  <br>Why don't you just read from Casanova's site instead? They have an online reader.</br>  <br>download them from madokami</br>  <br>You can read on casanovascans.com. you can download from #casanova@irc.irchighway.net. You can download from madokami. And you do torrent of all things?</br>  <br>Not got an account setup<br><br>I don't like using online readers</br></br></br>  <br> native speaker <br>That means being able to speak at a native level.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First<wbr>_language<br><br><br> this again <br>Not everyone is js06, give him a realistic time frame.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  I hope Alice wins the Souma bowl!  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128248666 <br>It's a lot comfier to use comicrack on tablet. Only online reader I use is ex</br>  <br> Not even in the running <br>A shame too, their interactions are great.</br></br>      <br>you're just a pleb for not liking them in the manga</br>  <br>Probably the latter knowing her.</br>  <br>The OP is about the same, ED is leagues worse.<br>It's reminiscent of Code Geass R1's OP change, that's how bad the 2nd ED is. Only redeemable thing is the visuals.<br><br><br> all that shit taste </br></br></br></br></br>  New OP song is ok, but not outstanding. The new ED song sucks thanks to that vocalist's thin voice and shitty, overblown "down to earth" style of barely hitting the notes.<br><br>The BGM OST really shone during this episode though. My favs were the short uplifting piece with male backup right before the OP during the camp celebration, that piece with female backup during when the dorm tasted Papasouma's dishes and that guitar piece when Souma talked during the night. That was good stuff that really enhanced the scenes.</br></br>  <br>Yuki a BEST</br>  <br>Misty is that you?</br>  Awww  <br>New OP is better than the first. New ED is just alright.</br>  <br>Nice to know her God's Tongue didn't apply to her taste in clothing. Those shoes are garish.<br><br>She has her uniform on in nearly every scene. Has she ever worn normal casual clothing outside of that one pool chapter?</br></br></br>  <br>Chilren don't pick their own clothes.</br>  <br>Alice picked him up from some hardcore restaurant in denmark. Basically kept beating him until he gave in and came with her.</br>  Nao is cute!Cute!  <br>there was a yukata, but I don't really remember casual clothing</br>  <br> People actually like Meat and Erina <br>Only good thing about Meat is that she is brown.</br></br>  <br>Damn Alice is fucking cute. Also I love how Hayama saw her greatest flaw when it comes to manage a store. Alice doesn't know how to prepare a menu that takes into consideration their situation which led to the first 2 terrible days. I am sure with this new focus The Three Stooges booth will become number 1 in no time in their district.</br>  So what will happen when Erina finds out that Soma is Jouichirou's son?  <br>I just hope they don't win the overall biggest earnings one, Alice doesn't really deserve it.</br>  <br> students_watching_fly_porn.webm </br>  Isn't there supposed to be around 500 000 people on the festival? It really doesn't feel that big.  <br>This. Though Fear and loathing aren't that bad.<br><br><br>Holy fuck, I didn't know how much I wanted this. <br>So basically what Souma is to Kanon, is what Jouichiro is to Erina.<br><br><br> putting souma from the ED in <br>Nice touch.<br><br><br> procrastinate <br>I thought I was the only one who did this, especially from picking up everything every season, refusing to drop anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Totsuki is enormous and most people go to the area Souma isn't in.</br>  <br>Think of 100k per day anon. Also is a cooking festival people will leave after eating once or twice they will not stay all fucking day.</br>  <br>No</br>  <br>Last opening was shit, this one is much better.</br>  <br><br>Make an account, it takes about 1 minute to do.<br>Or use FMD on batoto.<br><br><br> stuff the mapo tofu in the bun <br>The whole point is to make a vibrant dish, where customers can imagine the taste. A good looking dish creates an interest and appetite for it. Only those who have tasted what he's making beforehand, will understand that it's good, or those who see others eating it. They explained it well in the chapter. There's no way the next dish will be anything subtle or stuffed in a bun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They haven't even showed the other districts during prime time, we've seen a small part of where Souma is and that's it. <br><br><br> Last opening was shit, <br>At first it sounded pretty bad, but it honestly was pretty good. Definitely gets better the more you listen to it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There were a bunch of good Souma reaction images this episode like when he got left behind. Surprised I haven't seen any posted.</br>  <br>I am surprised no one is talking about how fucking cute Hinako is this episode.</br>  Holy shit, Nao is the best. Talks, threatens, gets wow'd, then casually scarfs down the hot bun. <br>So perfect.</br>  <br>I want to see a friendly disgusting-food-shokugeki between Nao and Soma</br>  <br>isn't Nao's food actually delicious despite the bad presentation?<br>I think Souma's bad food are genuinely bad to taste.</br></br>      <br>But she's always cute.</br>  <br>What if his nose is so sensitive that the world around him smells fucking awful, so he's constantly sniffing spices to not throw up.</br>  <br>It's that common problem, using something as good as fura fura for the first OP/ED always leaves a bad aftertaste because the following OPs or EDs will always be considerably worse.<br>I bet this one won't even get lead-ins during the episode and that voice is shit. At least IT FITS THE WORST POSSIBLE GIRL</br></br>  <br>Agreed, the whole Nao-centric nature of the ED fits how shitty the song is.</br>  <br>It's not the presentation, it's the incredibly strong and foul smell it gives off.</br>   Senzaemon appears with shadowed face and spooky glowing eyes in both opening <br>Why do they try to make him look like a final villain?</br>  <br>Souma will have to battle him to gain his blessing for when he decides to propose to Erina.</br>  <br><br><br>He's always sniffing the cinnamon because Jun gave it to him as a gift.</br></br></br>  <br><br> nao <br> worst girl </br></br></br>    <br> sonzoned <br> manhandled by a whimsical bitch <br>I'd feel bad for him, but he deserves it and it's hilarious.</br></br></br>  I don't know what you fags are talking about but that ED was hilarious. Sure it sounded absolutely revolting but it's still hilarious and fitting for Nao.  Pun entirely intended.   Yeah I'd fuck Souma's dad no homo.  <br>I had high expectations for the second OP/ED since the first OP was pretty good and the ED was great, the new ones are crap though, I'd say they are worse than most others this season.</br>  <br>hnnngh that nervous face</br>  <br>damn. no more this ED.</br>  <br> tripfag <br> no homo </br></br>  <br>WTF is meat doing there? She didn't even pass the prelims</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Is the typesetter for the extras around?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tit appeal, because I guess we don't have enough with Ryouko, Alice and Erina.</br>  <br>If this is an Autumn Election quarterfinal pic Erina shouldn't be there either.</br>  <br>They couldn't put Giganigga on there because that would ruin the surprise. I still don't like Meat being up there though</br>  <br>BRING BACK SPICE</br>  <br>Top-8 + Erina is an established group in manga. Meat does not belong here.</br>  <br> WTF <br>Return back to your shithole, you fucking shit-stain.</br></br>  <br> Erina's hair horn goes through the hole <br>How cute</br></br>  Unsurprisingly, Souma themed dished being added at J-world.  <br>Shitty CGI.</br>  <br> typeset <br>I'll bring it to casa</br></br>  <br>Nice.</br>  <br>Do you have the raw for the whole book? Are the recipes included as well?</br>   saiga is voiced by azazel <br>not sure how to feel about this</br>   Nao and Soma <br> experimenting bad food <br> "They have great chemistry" <br>how was this not brought up before.</br></br></br>  <br>OP is a bit better but the ED is fucking shit, jesus christ. What the fuck were they thinking? I'll have to have Spice on standby so I can play it over the other shitty song.</br>  <br><br><br>Best alumni</br></br></br>  <br>So Erina confirmed for Somas mother? His dad had to take on a fake name and drop out of school to cover his tracks?</br>  <br>of course. everyone's ages line up just right.</br>  <br>Yeah, she's just altered everyone's memories so they think she's younger than the actual age.</br>  <br><br>hishokoshippers blown out</br></br>  Do you guys think we'll some form of globetrotting arc, considering the elite ten are supposed to get a lot of fund, and the fact that Souma seems interesting in followings his dad's footsteps and explore different forms of cuisine and shit.  <br>I had to webm this</br>  <br>I'd love to have one, but only if Souma gets to bring friends (i.e. Erina)</br>  Hisako is the cutest.<br><br>Too bad she's like over 30.</br></br>  Garbage and garbage.<br><br>Why do they do this every time with two cour shows?</br></br>  <br> Too bad she's like over 30 <br>That's Hinako, nigga. The lady who wants to rape Megumi tenderly and gets bullied by Shinomiya.<br><br>Hisako is 15.<br><br><br>Here's your reply.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry, my bad. I can't into Japanese names.</br>  <br>I can scan them tomorrow if many want them.</br>   ghost dad   Is it even legal for Nikumi to carry a knife with her everywhere?  Now to wait another fucking week till next chapter...<br>I wish they did double chapters like Yamada</br>  <br> Too bad she's like over 30. <br>Hinako hasn't even hit 30. She's likely 29 at most. She graduated 11 years ago.</br></br>  <br>Okay, Hinako.</br>  <br>I'm laughing like a retard right now.<br>Is that from the extras too?</br></br>   learning from your mistakes is a bad thing <br><br>Is Erina some sort of idiot?</br></br>  I want to get back into this, is there anyway to bulk download from Madokami?  <br>Don't Japs finish high school at 18?</br>  <br>downthemall but you end up with 2 files for each link so you have to untick every other file to get rid of the fake files. If someone has a way around this I'd like to know.</br>  <br>She doesn't know the taste of failure.<br><br>I assume that once she loses, she'll lose so much of her shit, she'll start to degenerate.</br></br></br>  <br>Screenshot of what I mean, it picks up the read online link as well as the download for the file so you get duplicates.</br>  <br>It's one thing to fuck up or miss a shot, and quite another to fail as spectacularly as Souma and Team Alice did.<br><br> five Autumn Election finalists/semi-finalists in the red and under threat of explusion <br>That doesn't look good for the Academy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it is probably okay in Totsuki, this nigga has a Zanpakuto</br>  <br>The only good thing about erina is nothing</br>  <br>2/10 got me to reply</br>  <br><br>Ii just typed 'read' into the filter and then inverted selection</br></br>  <br>Yes, please do it, I'm interested in the recipe book.</br>  <br>Do the math anon.</br>  <br>No, it's from Pixiv.</br>  Do Japs really use blued steel for their kitchen knifes?  <br>Is Alice a Rhino?</br>  <br>Thanks, you've saved me a bunch of time.</br>    <br>She's a year younger than Shinomiya, so yeah, she's 28-29.</br>  <br> not getting things right the first time. </br>  <br>Are you supposed to eat Takumi?</br>  <br> being a one trick pony and a fluke </br>  <br> not doing everything right the first time all the time. </br>  <br>That anon was talking about yesterday's anime episode anon.<br>Erina tells Souma that what he said about learning from his mistake in the egg challenge was not worth of a high class chef.</br></br>  <br>No problem, you reminded me that DTA existed. <br><br>So the steps I've used are -highlight chapters I want, DTA, type read into filter, invert selection, toggle selected. You get junk too, but you don't get duplicates.</br></br></br>  <br>When I filter read it doesn't actually select anything, it just turns them red, so when I invert selection it selects all.</br>  <br>Actually what she said is that a chef can't afford to make mistakes. Which, in terms of serving food to a customer, is actually pretty accurate. A bad review can destroy your career.<br><br>Erina's only wrong in suggesting that you can't make mistakes in your own time.</br></br></br>  <br>Nevermind I had zip files filtered too it works when I uncheck that.</br>  The brown people will match up and Meat will win the Hayamabowl.  <br>Her very idol Joichirou does what she chides Soma for. That dumb bitch will learn soon enough.</br>  <br> Will anyone here actually cares if that happens? </br>   Worst adaptation of this summer   It's not significantly worse than the manga, shitposting about the designs aside.  <br>Manga is better BTFO</br>  I must say the character designs are rather unsettling when animated.  <br>the feels is so different<br>Manga= Horror/Romance<br>Anime= Moeshit/Romance</br></br></br>   tfw this kills the manga too   <br>source of these numbers?</br>  <br> &gt;tfw this kills the manga too <br>no the manga is selling after the 2nd episode aired But the bd.....

I didn't think I'd get to find a legit reason to use this so soon after making it.<br>Thank you, you dip-shit.<br>Thank you.</br></br></br>  <br>think of the child...oh yeah you are; as you were!</br>  <br>at least we'll have this gem to remember out of all the shitposting that's happened since the anime was announced</br>  <br>quick, get the Madonna song off the school PA, they are getting way too 'into' a certain song right now</br>  <br>Baka!BAKA!</br>  <br>That's not Gakkou Gurashi or GATE.</br>  <br> Worst adaptation of this summer <br><br>It's a damn shame.</br></br></br>  <br>Good thing it's not then.</br>  <br>That's moeshit.</br>  <br>horrific moeshit</br>  flopped on 4chan, flopped on 2chan, flopped on youtube, flopped on japan (Shit sales)<br><br>what is remaining?</br></br>  <br>For the manga to sell worse because of it.</br>  <br> Manga= Horror/Romance <br><br>Hahahaha, thanks anon. 'twas a good laugh</br></br></br>  How do you SAVE EVERYONE?  <br>By killing them all.</br>    <br>Sauce?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Because a long time ago when source is given it opens the floodgates to people asking for source overwhelming any other posts.<br>So anons adopted the attitude of not giving source, stopping the floods of "Source?", this becomes a method of weeding out newcomers who won't bother lurking to learn the board "culture" and unspoken rules, leaving only anons who are willing to integrate themselves into the board, call it elitism, you're probably right, but is sure as hell is better than floods of posts begging for source.<br><br>And these days anons have much better resources to find source themselves instead of asking.<br>But I suppose with the internet being as convenient as it is, people simply aren't patient enough to lurk and wait for information to pop up anymore, they have to have it right at this moment.<br><br><br>Yes.<br>That or wait until you come by a post with an image that relates to the one you want.<br>I remember finding source after years of waiting, "Wait, I remember this, oh yeah, it's that one cropped image from that time."<br>Be patient, lurk more.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not recognising asanagi's art <br>Lurk moar tbh</br></br>  <br>I get what you say, sauce goes on /r/. Still, a name or even a word can help stop all the requests. At least it'd shut up some people.</br>  New ep in less than an hour and no thread yet?<br>Let's fix that.</br>  <br>Cause that's what defined him as a character.</br>  <br>Aren't you happy he kind of became a better person as the series progressed? Especially after Yamada pointed out how lonely he truly was.</br>  <br> Aren't you happy he kind of became a better person as the series progressed? <br>He did? He always seemed caring of the people working at Wagnaria. That never changed.</br></br>  <br>He only started caring after the first season, even trying to help Satou with Yachiyo whenever he could.<br>All he did was enjoy other's misfortunes during the first season.</br></br>  Do you even work?  I can't believe Harry Potter hasn't gotten an adaptation yet considering that it's still huge in Japan. The doujin market would explode.  <br>That would be great too because the plans and interactions of Bugg and Tehol are probably my favorite thing in the series.</br>  <br> Daphne Greengrass <br>I've read some of those books over a dozen times and I don't even remember a bitch named that.</br></br>  <br>And now, if they weren't total asshats, I could actually like the appearances to Draco, Snape, Lucius, etc. Seriously, Draco doesn't look NEARLY evil enough in that.</br>  <br>It's called the shoebox project. You'll probably think it's bad. I probably shouldn't have even said anything.</br>  <br> I HIGHLY doubt good old voldyshorts would let his Corpse Munchers into his little butt-buddy club without them doing SOMETHING evil first.  <br>Maybe, but we don't actually know that. For all we know he was recruited from Hogwarts and he didn't have the kids do evil shit. For all we know, he could have been used as a spy or a potions healer after Hogwarts rather than as a guerilla fighter.<br><br> Snape was doing dark and evil shit in like his fifth year. <br>And Harry was throwing around Imperius like candy in his seventh.<br><br> Also, he legitimately mindraped Harry <br>True, but Dumbledore told him to.<br><br> and held a sixteen-year grudge because he was butthurt. <br>That's fair and what makes him a shit character, but it's not a plothole.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is there no Rokka no Yuusha thread? Does /a/ not like this anime?  <br>I bet they will spend whole episode 5 for the first time discussion of seventh.</br>  <br>People complain when adaptation is going too fast, then they complain its going too slow. Okay.</br>  <br>Yeah there were quite a few wideshots of characters that looked really bad in episode 2, I hope the art quality stabilizes but it's not a good sign.</br>  <br>People have no idea what they're talking about, anon. All of this is bullshit nonsense. It's just electrical impulses uploading noise into the global consciousness.</br>  This is animation director list of episode 2  Nao is an anime nerd.  <br>Sorry, I got her and Yuriko mixed up.</br>  <br>Kotori is a fujoshi, Chihiro is a capitalist.</br>  Why is Rin so fucking hot?  <br>  She is literally a direct copy of Kotori  <br><br>No she isn't. Kotori is a bumbling OL with a habit of falling into delusions and lazing around.<br><br>Meanwhile, Chihiro is a completely collected person. She once non-chalantly said that she knows EVERYTHING about the idols. Even as a joke, there are plenty of things hinting that she is a keikaku doori type of mastermind. <br><br>And we're not even entering fan culture of her being the surrogate mascot of all of Scamco's Evils.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>They are both freaking ugly cunts.</br></br></br></blockquote>]
