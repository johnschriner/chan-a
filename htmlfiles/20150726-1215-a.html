[ Jojolion 45 photo raws:<br> http://tieba.baidu.com/p/390490144<wbr>1?fr=frs</wbr> <br>Text translation<br> https://mangahelpers.com/t/kewl021<wbr>0/releases/41553</wbr> <br><br>http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87<br><br>The twins came to Morioh to use the wall eyes to merge, discuss.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is it weird that I like listening to the soundtracks for the anime even though I haven't watched it yet and have only read the manga? They're really good.<br><br>I'm waiting on a proper chapter 45 release because I don't like to read things twice so close together.</br></br>  <br>If that were the case then why didn't they go there first instead of attacking Gappy and Karera?</br>  <br>I think Karera did some shit to them and they want her dead</br>  <br>Why is Stone Ocean so good?</br>  <br>Gay Priest and snails</br>  <br>It kind of baffles me that people don't like it more. The last half or so is the wildest ride Jojo has to offer and I expected to hate it, but it was amazing.<br><br>I would love to see an anime adaptation, though even if DP gets that far it would be years and years away...</br></br></br>  <br>Because Jolyne is Joseph and Jotaro combined</br>  Incest weatherman is here.  It pisses me off people don't like vento aureo just because shitty translation, I'm Italian and we got the official translated manga and is one of the best parts, the ending is the only bad thing but the characters and the fights are the best.  I really liked Diego, because it felt like he was his own character, rather than DIO on a horse. He was a rival to Johny and Gyro, but not in a "Good vs. Evil" sense like the original DIO and Joestars, he was just a rival set out to win the race and get the corpse.<br>He wasn't necessarily a bad guy, just an asshole who sometimes went too far (Like with Wekapipo)<br><br>But then Diego 2 Za Warudo came along and was literally DIO on a horse. I know that was on purpose, but come the fuck on.</br></br></br>  <br>I liked both Diegos</br>  <br>To be honest, I did like how much more ruthless Diego 2 was, and how surprisingly different he was from the original.</br>  <br>Diego's rivalry with Johnny felt kinda forced, but they still played off his character super well. Alt Diego was cheesy and shoehorned though, but that made Diego himself feel a bit better because of it.<br><br>Still have no idea why HorseDIO just went along with locking away the corpse though.</br></br></br>  <br>I couldn't figure it out either. All I can come up with is that doing so made the corpse his? I think? I don't know.</br>  Where do I download the Part 5 from coloured adventure? They only have the first chapter up on their website.  <br>I think that's all they did?</br>  <br>Nope, http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/jojos<wbr>-bizarre-adventure-part-5-vento-aur<wbr>eo-r6270<br><br>They've done up to Vol. 52. The entire download page is outdated, I think.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>They don't really update the blog much anymore, check their facebook page instead, pretty sure they post download links there. The facebook url is in the pastebin.</br>  <br>They only post their bato.to links there it seems. <br><br><br>Get one of those chapter downloading programs. that''s probably the only way around it right now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's gonna be fucking annoying to grab every chapter from their facebook though<br><br><br>Which programs are these?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I liked it less primarily because the pacing is all kinds of fucked up. Secondary reasons are low tier villain and some fairly uninteresting stand battles. It still had some really nice highs though</br>  <br>This one for instance<br> http://sourceforge.net/projects/ha<wbr>kuneko/ </wbr> <br><br>It's pretty self explanatory when it comes to using it. There are many other ones like it.</br></br></br></br>  It's kinda funny looking back at the old parts and getting reminded of stuff that was left out in later JoJo parts like the abrupt color palette swings.<br>Outside of cover art, of course.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=TJD<wbr>X41N6aSU</wbr>  [ ]<br>What's the music that plays when Beck melts into a puddle called?</br>  5=6&gt;4&gt;7&gt;2&gt;1&gt;3  <br>Starting at 3:00 that nigga has two right hands.</br>  <br>So you think he's one of the Geils?

Her stand allows her to control earth and she's the one responsible for the Wall Eyes. She's an agent of the CIA and is trying to uncover the corpse's teeth, which somehow got lost when Johnny brought it to Morioh so she can bring them back to America and complete the corpse. The teeth are buried in the areas with the Wall Eyes, cause people who go close to them to get bitten. She can't dig them out, so she's looking for another method to get in. The rockmen are the result of a failed experiment to get them out conducted in the 90's where she created humans made of stone with her stand and someone else used their own stand to give life to them.<br>She will use the ground in the Higashitakas' backyard to fuse herself with this universe's Kosaku Kawajiri and gain his stand power to rewind to a certain point in time, but it only works in areas whose earth has been affected by her original stand power. This way, she hopes to bring those areas back to the day of the 2011 tsunami and use the water's force to dig the teeth out, regardless of collateral damage.<br><br>Don't ask me how I know this.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm totally okay with this.</br>  think josuke ever met his secret admirer for love?  <br>How come Kawajiri has a Stand in this universe then?</br>  <br>How do you know that, though?</br>  <br>Got bitten by a Wall Eye.<br>She knows of the stand abilities of everyone in Morioh and she uses him as a last resort by using her earth powers to bury herself with him.<br>She takes measures to ensure the resulting person will know who they are and what they have to do.</br></br></br>  <br>Its almost one and i'm too tired to keep reading, but Uni starts on monday, want to get it finished beforehand</br>  <br>Wait a minute. A woman fusing with a man? How would that even work?<br><br>Half of each set of genitalia? One womanly breast and one that's just a pectoral? It sounds cruel more than anything else.<br><br> That's not even going into my stupid headcanon that the only reason Josuke doesn't look like more of a freak is because Josefumi and Kira were related and had very very similar builds and features, so the transition was almost seamless besides things like lol4balls </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fusions don't result in a 50/50 new thing. Remember the fruits Kyo used to show Josuke. They weren't a 50/50 split.<br><br>If that obvious bullshit happened you probably wouldn't have a half-tit shemale abomination.</br></br></br>  <br><br>So she's half great and half shit?</br></br>  <br><br> Animefags <br> Reading the manga <br><br>M--M-MAXIMUM BUZZWORD!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> read the mangas <br> haven't watched the animes <br> part 1 is still my favorite </br></br></br>  <br>Josuke was too pure for that sort of carry-on.</br>  <br>That's perfectly respectable and don't let any of the shitheads around here tell you otherwise. <br><br>I like Part 1 a lot. Part 1 Dio is probably my favorite villain.</br></br></br>    <br> Read manga from when Duwang first got translated. <br> Always loved Joseph best, got fit so I could cosplay him <br> anime comes out <br> now everyone assumes i'm animeonly fag because My favorite jojo is Joseph and my favorite Stand is Cream. </br></br></br></br>    <br>In-character pics or GTFO</br>  <br><br>NOT TODAY GAY PRIEST</br></br>  <br>You can't stop this Gay Priest!</br>    Gay priest is here now.<br><br> Now knock it off </br></br>  <br>Praise!</br>  <br>Was this the guy who got turned into a Boombox?</br>  <br>That's what's literally happening in that very image, so yes.</br>    <br>I assume Mista was too good for this image.</br>  <br>theres a better one now</br>  <br> change the file name within the image <br> don't change the file name of the image itself <br>You fucked up.</br></br></br>  <br>Change it yourself, ya autist.</br>  <br>Fuck, I got this off Doc, and thought it was still called Meme_after</br>  <br> that everything <br> especially the trips </br></br>  <br> josuke had girls all around him when jotaro met him <br> had a secret admirer  <br> later gets jealous claims to have no experience with that sort of thing and gets jealous of koichi </br></br></br>    <br>Also was jealous of Yuuta who had girls visiting him all the time in hospital.</br>  <br>Araki later rectified this by the Josuke of the SBRverse having the best girl in the series as his waifu.</br>  <br>Forgot the image</br>  <br>Josuke's character changed so dramatically after the first couple of arcs that it seems like we're meant to just pretend the admirers never existed in the first place.</br>  <br>Josuke's only unchanging aspect, other than his appearance and meh hair, is his unfailing ability to be cute. I think moefags will be in for a treat if David gets onto part 4 in 2016.</br>  <br> meh hair <br>Oooh you're fucked now...</br></br>  <br> implying I wouldn't want Josuke to fuck me </br>  <br> meh hair </br>  <br> Johnathan <br>Probably had bitches all over him in college, or Dio specifically was scaring them away<br><br> Joseph <br>Is thought of as handsome by both news lady suzie Q, and mariah the second they see him(not bane)<br><br> Jotaro <br>Drowning in bitches, had stuartists getting wet at him, had an underage vietnamese kid fall for him, and Midler swoon over him<br><br> Josuke <br>Had bitches left and right, and an admirer<br><br> Giorno <br>Swarmed with bitches in early chapters and later is a mob boss with bitches kissing his rings<br><br> Jolyne <br>Had an abusive cheating bf....<br><br> Johnny <br>Was a straight up chad back in his Legful days, never seen without a bitch<br><br> Gappy <br>10/10 Waifu, and every female character he has encountered, including his own half-sister, wants to get with him. Thank god he didn't visit Holly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> stuartists <br><br>And I'm pretty sure it was never stated that Jolyne's bf cheated on her or abused her. He fucked her over, but he didn't fuck her up.</br></br></br>  <br>Dio wouldn't have needed to scare anyone away while Jonathan was in college because Jonathan already had Erina by then and Jonathan is the best most faithful waifu.</br>   finished watching Stardust Crusaders <br> Already caught up in the manga <br> almost turned on the SNES RPG to play <br><br>I've got JJBA relapse so badly, I almost considered writing a crossover fan-fiction<br>[spoilers]With ZnT. Unlike with other crossovers, Jotaro wouldn't be replacing Saito, Void Magic would be responsible for sending Stand Users across the realms[/spoiler]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Johnathan had erina <br><br>Read the manga fool. Johnathan hadn't seen erina since they were kids after Dio defiled her mouth. <br><br>After the mansion burned down (after they graduated) was the first time they had seen eachother in years.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its even covered in the anime, its not flat out said, but you have to be retarded to not know that they meant they hadn't seen each other for a long time</br>  <br><br>Doesn't matter. What about "best most faithful waifu" don't you understand?</br></br>  <br>He didn't even recognize her, its obvious they hadn't see eachother since childhood<br><br><br>Dio ruined that though. Erina didn't even want to talk to him or see him ever again after being besmirched. Why would johnathan hold out for a woman he knew never wanted to be with him because his evil brother fucked it up?</br></br></br></br>  <br>[Gravity] and also [Fate]</br>  <br> underage vietnamese kid <br>But Anne was from Hong Kong.</br></br>  <br>what's the source of that gif?</br>  <br>Protip: 『These are Japanese quotation marks』</br>  <br>Things that bounce thursday<br>Use reverse image search</br></br>  <br>ok thanks for the tip m8</br>  <br>Also gross I hate chive</br>  <br>「These」look better though.</br>    <br>what episode is old joseph from?

I just killed that fucker, serves him right, it hurt like a bitch when he stabbed me, now the arrow's mine! <br> Let's stab a rat to see if it works! <br> Uh, that didn't work so well. <br> Oh shit, there's more stand users after me, fuck fuck fuck <br> My stand's pretty good tho, I've just gotta be careful. <br> Shit, they can find me! God fucking dammit I don't wanna go to jail <br> Okay, if I kill the guy who can find me I'm good, just gotta stay cool <br> Hah, this guy's alone, I can kick his ass, my stand rocks! <br> Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck I'm losing whyyyyy <br> I gotta kill that fucker, I'll get on board the boat and then get out disguised <br> Come on you fucking idiot hit the other guy. <br> FUCK NO NOT ME <br> Jail </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying Pucci didn't fuck ireneverse vampire Speedwagon </br>  <br>not enough cheekbone in that pic</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hTP<wbr>4OP62X7E</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Most stand users are just<br> holy shit I got a stand! <br> manage to use it on somebody to great effect <br> get fucked over by stupid shit <br> hospitalized/jailed/killed <br>anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nips like watching gaijin react to their shows?</br>  <br>What would you guys really do if you had a stand? No lying.<br> If it's sentient, play video games. <br> Fuck with people. <br> Maybe take some food/quick cash. <br> Why do I even need this ability again? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If it was something like Hierophant Green that could turn into tentacles or string like Stone Free?

I dress a bit more adventurous now.  <br>Depends on the ability<br><br>I would probably use whatever stand I'd end up with to  make farm work easier <br><br>Having a stand would be cool and all but you'd eventually have to deal with other stand users at some point, and they will probably be crazy as hell, fortunately you just have to look for someone buff as fuck or in outrageous clothing to spot them</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really, but since reading Jojo i've become bisexual.</br>  <br>Well yeah. Only problem is that I attract gays now.</br>  <br>You're the one who told me to tell the truth, 1) because it'd be funny to see how they act in public 2) You can feel what your stand feels 3) Cant be traced<br><br>Yes, though Kakyoin forgot that like an autist</br></br></br>  <br> Yes, though Kakyoin forgot that like an autist <br>He's evil.</br></br>  <br>Unless you're not the anon that wrote </br>  <br>He's evil?</br>    <br>Yes because the losers are the evil ones and  dying is the biggest loss of all. </br>  <br>But that would mean DIO's evil</br>  <br> YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO </br>  <br>Jolyne is Evil.</br>   im morally ambiguous?   <br>those filthy fucking Joestars are evil, jealous of dio</br>  <br>Actually, a combination of Kamen Rider and Jojo have made me sort of want to. I haven't taken the plunge with anything outrageous but I do have a white denim jacket that will probably make me feel like Kotaro Minami and Caesar when I finally get around to figuring out what to wear with it.

You're still good is my view.</br>  <br>Can I pick the ability at the very least?<br>I have no use for combat, unless i'm not the only user with a stand in the area but lets go with<br> Marine Biology manipulation <br>Basically I can grow Auxiliary Organs, or really anything of my picking as long as it involves the ocean and implement it as a function on my body.

There's no point in saying "too sweet" when he's a MAX coffee lover and when it doesn't answer her question.<br>To be fair, he did describe the sweet taste on his mouth as you can clearly read in the attached picture, but that's not what he was mostly thinking about.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what the fuck would he mean with "too naive"?<br><br>That's stupid</br></br></br>  Don't bite to obvious bait if you guys are going to do this.<br>I don't know what's worse, obvious bait or people biting to obvious bait.</br>  <br>Circlejerking?, memes?,hentai?</br>  <br>Iroha literally said that he was naive for saying sweet nothings to her while she was making sweets.<br>It's a clever wordplay but it's easy to see.</br></br>  <br>reminder: Irohafags were trying to tout "sly" as an alternative translation for "amai" back when spoilers were popping up.</br>  <br> I don't know what's worse <br>Cancerous YY fanbase being cancerous. Best thing is we're blamed in the end.<br><br>Anyway, dumping some lewdhasu.<br>1/5</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder: Retards were trying to spin this scene as a flat out rejection from 8man to Iroha</br>  <br>2/5</br>  <br>3/5<br><br><br>Ah yes, those were fun times.</br></br></br></br>  <br>4/5</br>  <br>5/5</br>  <br>Reminder: to this day, even bigger retards spin the scene as 8man intentionally flirting with Iroha.</br>  I remind them.  <br>Post more doujins faggot</br>  <br> what the fuck would he mean with "too naive"? <br>She said that he was naive for hitting on her while she was making sweets.<br>"Too naive" would mean that he's thinking about himself. <br>Going to her randomly just to praise her cooking, thinking that it would do him some good, and then having it spin off into another "rejection" (he still thinks that those are actual rejections) is something naive from his part.<br>Call me delusional all you want, but I say that his intentions were lewd and he wanted to score points with her from the start. His behavior after that scene doesn't support a "too sweet" level of fakeness either.<br><br>But then again, Watari is a cunt and used wordplay to mask whatever he meant with that scene,</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Translated Yahari Fanart:<br> http://pastebin.com/dJas1C5B </br></br>  I can spam my goddess here right?  <br>Yes you can.<br>  our goddess  <br>FTFY</br></br></br>  <br>To the extent that allows the thread to not turn into a dump with no discussion</br>  <br>Great, I will translate some of the Saika's images</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128553600 <br>Why not have Iroha get with Hayama then NTR'ed the cunt with the blademaster general?</br>  So what did you all think of Zoku compared to the first season and which of the pair did you like better?<br>Minus "I like it more because Iroha" answers since those would be obvious to many in this thread.</br>  <br> his intentions were lewd and he wanted to score points with her from the start <br>You're definitely delusional. If anything, the praise came from pure onii-chan instincts, and calling himself naive after the exchange was him finally realizing he needs to reign that shit in.</br></br>  <br>Second season if better, better animation, adaptation pacing, but manly because of Iro - Oh.</br>  <br>Better animation because it got a bigger budget and a better/larger studio. Most characters got an upgrade visually except for Yukino.</br>  <br>the pacing was terrible for S2 though. Sure a ton of shit got cut in S1 but that just amounted to a handful of inconsequential, episodic chapters, while Feel ended up butchering the last few chapters of volume 9 and all of volume 10 so they could force 11 into the mix too.</br>  <br>Feel free to.  Also someone translate the Yui fluff doujin pls </br>  <br> If anything, the praise came from pure onii-chan instincts, and calling himself naive after the exchange was him finally realizing he needs to reign that shit in. <br><br>And yet he keeps at it for the rest of his interactions with her on the volume.<br>Doesn't make much sense because it's not really onii-chan instincts to behave the way he did or think about lewd stuff whenever she does something or he sees her in that damned apron.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And were I should post the translated one?</br>   Senpai...sorry but it's impossible here.   <br>Here is fine. Indicate the link.</br>    <br>Good, but put the text in the image <br><br>Ok, but I will do it later, it's too late now</br></br></br>  <br> Good, but put the text in the image <br>I'm not the typeset anon, I'm just translating it.<br> Senpai...seenpai... </br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128553600 <br>why not both? Seems especially fitting.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128553600 <br>Neither. Iroha can seriously do better than either of them, if by some miracle she loses the 8bowl she would do good to find someone still her mental and physical (attractive) equal at least.</br>  <br> if by some miracle she loses the 8bowl <br>I didn't know Watari not being a hack counted as a miracle now.</br></br>  <br>They've all been translated, it's just that we've never had a cleaner for the pictures</br>  <br>I think there are a lot of people who can actually make the translation but nobody wants to make the typesetting</br>  <br>The one with the underwear should be easy for the typeset anon to do. But the rest are the opposite.</br>  TL-Irohafag isn't here yet?  <br/>  シスコン！！  <br>Is it wrong that the only reason why I want the LNs to be longer (more volumes) is just to see more possible iroha/komachi interactions?</br>  Finally, we're having this.<br><br> Official Art / Feel <br>http://imgur.com/a/o2CeK#0<br><br> Fan Art / 4koma (still updated constantly) <br>http://imgur.com/a/BrBGm#0<br><br> The retard here lost the pastebin link to the webms, I'll need to do it again.<br>本当に、 ごめんなさい！</br> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I love you.<br>.<br>.<br> sfx: anything that indicates somebody leaning in for a kiss. </br></br></br></br>  Are the release dates for the OVA's out yet so I can leave these threads and know when to come back?  <br>No date yet. <br>We're just waiting for that 10,5 OVA so we can die in peace.</br></br>  <br>Damn, you should've uploaded this from the start so I didn't have to redraw the chairs in the previous image.</br>  <br> 10,5 OVA <br>I have a bad feeling the date will be butchered to death. Instead, the YY scenes will be emphasized.</br></br>  <br>My bad, I'll keep that in mind next time.</br>  <br>No, that's actually good taste on your part.<br>If Watari is smart, he'll keep it going for a bit longer. We have Iroha's birthday, white day and Komachi entering the same school coming up.</br></br>  Doujins fucking when.<br><br><br>We'll find out next volume, I guess.</br></br></br>  いろはす～  Why would you like this two-timing slut? <br>She's literally the worst.

Now it would be perfect if we could also get rid of the 邪魔者.<br><br><br>They are together in chapter 1 (becoming an editor) and chapter 2 is all about Iroha. Chapter 3 is about Watari complaining to his editor when he is alone with each girl. I don't really think they would focus in that chapter, though I'm fine with the library Irohasu scene where 8man forgets to take photos</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Dat blushing <br>Kaduki is such a bro</br></br></br></br>  <br> 邪魔者 <br>仕方ない. . .<br><br>More than 10 minutes for chapter 2 would be a dream.</br></br></br></br>    Okay I know this is an Iroha thread but here's a question about the story.<br><br>Who exactly is Yukidad? We know nothing about him except that he's part of the Chiba diet.<br>What if he's the actual villain and Yukimom is just a smokescreen?<br><br>Then there's 8dad, we haven't seen him appear once and with the very view info we have of him he's just a more rotten overprotective 8man.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Speak of the best mangaka, and he shall deliver.<br>He literally tweeted that 4 minutes ago.</br></br>  <br>It's Iroha Sly Saturday after all</br>  <br><br>Based mangaka is based</br></br>  <br>Some anons have speculated that he is a chill dad and that he would get along great with 8man. Furthermore, they jokingly stated that he might be somewhat similar to 8man in regards to his cynicism and how they get push around by the women in the household. However, we don't really know anything about him besides what you stated.<br><br>I personally believe that he is a person that is not a pushover in the household because he is the sole reason why Yukino is able to live alone. Nevertheless, I don't think we will get much of him, WW doesn't seem to like or care about dads.</br></br></br>  Iroha's mother introduction when?  <br>Hope Watari delivers in vol 13, once all this service club drama is over<br><br>How would she be like?</br></br></br>  <br> How would she be like? <br>She would definetely look like Iroha, just like every other girl and their mothers in the series.<br><br>Personality wise, she'd invite 8man to her house just to leave him alone with Iroha in the house. <br>Because she needs to spend hours buying groceries and all that.<br><br> WW please </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Yukino and Iroha gets combined <br><br>How would Hachiman proceed?</br></br>  <br>He would die from lack of oxygen and blood going to his brain.</br>  <br>walk her home gently.</br>  <br> Combining perfection with copypasta <br><br>No thanks</br></br></br>  <br>That literally looks like Yukino.<br><br>Why is this allowed?</br></br></br>  <br> How would she be like? <br>A sweet, teasing, and hard-working mother.</br></br>  <br>Yukino is an empty shell after all. That's what she would look like after she starts chasing Iroha</br>  Any tlfags around?<br>There's an entire new non-h Iroha doujin on pixiv, just ready to be translated:<br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=manga&amp;illust_id=51590365</wbr></br></br>  <br>Hachiman would praise the Yukino in her and would be somewhat awkward to the Iroha in her.</br>  <br>The art looks horrible</br>      <br><br><br>Nice story though.</br></br></br>  http://animaru.jp/shop/g/g105405<br>Best girl already sold out.</br>  <br>HHHHHNNNNNNGGGG.<br><br>I need to find out how to get one of this.</br></br></br>  <br> Trap already sold out <br> YY2 still for sale <br><br>I want to believe they bought Saika to see what's under the word Sample</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd bet anything it's just going to be a nice bulge.</br>  <br>They can't show a bulge</br>  <br>If they can't do that then I'm starting to get curious too because those look like some tight underwear.</br>   But Hiratsuka-sensei, on the other, hummed something cheerfully. “Noooow then, I wonder who the point goes to this time.” <br> “It has to be a big win for Hachiman.” <br> I did the conceptual planning and the producing this time, after all. Er, well, when it came to the results and whether we actually accomplished any good, that was an extremely delicate matter, but it made sense when you took my intentions and attitude into account. <br> Hiratsuka-sensei snorted. “But if Yukinoshita didn’t hear you out and make a decision, you probably wouldn’t have done anything. Plus, if Yuigahama didn’t convince you, you wouldn’t have found a reason to do anything in the first place.” <br> “Damn, so we’re all number one…” <br> And I was so close. Or so I thought, when she flashed me a toothy grin. <br> “Since when were you deluded about being number one?” <br> “Not this again…” <br> “You’ve probably been a pain in the arse since day one. I’m deducting marks for that. Yukinoshita and Yuigahama have one point each and you have zero.” <br><br>Alright so Yui was in the contest since the beginning.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, only Yukinofags believed she wasn't in the contest</br>  <br>I am a Yukinofag, I just didn't know she was in the contest because it was never really brought up with her.</br>  <br>It was brought up a couple times, but from the past threads I've only seen Yukinofags stating the contest was only between Yukino and 8man</br>  <br>Now this does beg the question, when the winner decides to give the order does he or she give one command to one of the losers or does the single command apply to both losers.</br>  <br>Commands should be individual but that doesn't stop the winner to give the same command to both of them</br>  Not mine but from some anon about the story if Yukino was replaced by Iroha in vol 1<br> Iroha welcomes him to the club acting doe-fully. <br> 8man sees through her shit and tries to intimidate her so he won't be manipulated <br> she convincingly pretends to be scared <br> his onii-chan instincts kick in and he apologizes and offers his sleeves to dry her tears <br> Shizuka punches him for not apologizing immediately for hurting her feelings earlier <br> She bursts into laughter and he remembers she was full of shit and calls her out on it <br> Shizuka breaks them up and clearly explains what the club is about <br> Iroha makes a comment about how 8man is probably unreliable  <br> 8man refutes her point by talking about how much he does for Komachi <br> he gets called a siscon <br> They form a case-by-case competition where the loser has to buy the winner a meal. <br><br> Yui comes in with her request <br> Iroha is a master patissiere and shows Yui how its done <br> 8man does his thing <br><br> They argue who won the case Iroha fulfilling the request or 8man resolving the underlying issue. <br> Iroha goes to get Shizuka to choose the winner <br> 8man catches a glimpse into her bag and looks at her old hello kitty coin purse with only one 100 yen coin <br> Iroha comes back with Shizuka <br> 8man concedes his victory, tells Iroha she's pretty amazing at pastries, and says that Shizuka likes him more anyway and would have been on his side. <br> Iroha is overwhelmed by his compliment and admits it's a shared victory <br> Shizuka hits him for calling her over just to watch them flirt <br> 8man insists on getting her something from the vending machines to celebrate their first and successful request <br> He puts in the money and she asks him what he would get <br> Max Coffee™ <br> She takes a sip and hands him the can <br> He hesitates to take it from her and buys his own can <br> He makes a comment about not wanting indirect kisses <br> She takes it the wrong way thinking he's saying she's skanky and her mouth is dirty and she gets pouty </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would Iroha be in the club?</br>  <br>The same reason why 8man is in the club, they both have twisted personalities and Hiratsuka would want them to change</br>  <br> Yui pops in to give them cookies and asks about joining the club. <br> Iroha tries to use her girl powers to make Yui not join and insists on being friends to get closer to Hayama. <br> She tells her she's pretty brave for confessing to cookie and that she must be pretty busy juggling a new boyfriend and her popular clique. <br> She goes over Iroha's head to Shizuka to join, who gives her the green light to cock block 8man <br><br> Miura doesn't try to keep Yui from having lunch with Iroha <br> nothing changes for Zaimokuza's arc <br><br> Iroha invites Hayama and Yumiko to help Saika with tennis since they're all plebs <br> Practice match Hayama and Yumiko Vs. 8man and Saika <br> Hayama saves Yumiko from Meteor Strike, Iroha visibly jelly. <br> Yumiko technically won the request, so 8man buys her a can of Max Coffee™ <br> She accepts it and admits it'd taste pretty good with a double scoop of choco-mocha and chocolate icecream  <br> Iroha turns into Jell-O™ <br> Yumiko invites everyone to go out for icecream afterschool, Hayama declines and Tobe gets tricked into going to pay for Iroha <br> 8man accidentally walks in on the three girls changing, Yumiko's motherly instincts kick in and she protects Iroha's chastity from 8man's eyes <br><br> Hayama's request is the same except Iroha using lunch with 8man as an excuse to "observe" Hayama's group </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Iroha invites 8man to the study group because she doesn't want to be alone with Yuiadumb and uses the excuse"I'm a dummy too Tee Hee~" :P <br> Komachi shows up <br> Iroha introduces herself as 8man's precious, defenseless Kouhai <br> Komachi sees through her shit and tries to ignore her existence  <br> But she instinctively clings onto 8man's, when Iroha gets too close <br> Yui runs home to get Sable for animal therapy(suggested by Iroha) <br> Yui gets told to just stay home because Saki would already be gone by the time she gets back <br> She still suggests using love for a boy to cure Saki <br> Iroha asks 8man to take the role and refuses to use glorious Hayama-senpai <br> 8man calls her black-lace and just straight up asks what she's doing tonight <br> Saki gets pissy and dumbfounded, "You're an idiot.", and walks away. <br> They try to find out where she works from Taishi's info. <br> Yui rejoins them because of a text from Saika, Iroha is displeased <br> Zaimokuza tries to force maid outfits on Iroha and Saika <br> 8man steps in only to protect Iroha because oniichan instincts and he wanted to see Saika in a maid outfit <br> Everyone is told to regroup after being explained to clearly to change into classy casual <br> Only 8man and Iroha show dressed up, everyone else cheers them on <br> 8man notices Iroha barely has the tags hidden on her outfit. <br> Saki curtly insults both of them by saying he had to resort to compensated dating after she turned him down <br> Iroha actually gets mad and walks off <br> 8man explains to her he came to talk about Taishi and to meet up later because he has to comfort Iroha. <br> 8man waits for Iroha to change and sees the receipts in her bag <br> She catches him and tells him in a jokingly serious tone that he's gross for trying to steal her panties <br> 8man offers to walk her home to keep her safe from perverts <br> She refuses because the only pervert is right there in front of her and she didn't want him to see her sulking <br> He manages to gently walk her home anyways <br> Things get resolved the next morning. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 8man buys Saki a can of Max Coffee, since she fulfilled Taishi's request by quitting her job and applying for scholarships <br> She accepts it and tells him that she's going to need so because she wants to go apologize to her parents and talk to them about other things(her marriage dowry) </br></br>  <br>Why wouldn't she?</br>  <br> &gt;He manages to gently walk her home anyways <br>Every time.</br></br>  <br>Why did Yukinoshita form a club anyway? Secret base to  "enjoy" yourself ?</br>  <br> liking the inferior version of Haruno </br>  <br>Saika was a limited run while the other two girls aren't. I'm not complaining though, the other two probably would have been long gone before I could get my own order in.</br>  I want 8man to sexual assault any of the girls<br>It will be funny</br>  Keep the thread alive  <br> 8man notices Iroha barely has the tags hidden on her outfit. <br>Poorfag Iroha makes my heart go dokidoki</br></br>  <br>Where's the poorfag pasta? The rewritten version</br>  <br>This one or the LN quotes about the poorfag theory evidences?<br><br>Before the date<br> Wakes up at 4am, puts on her tracksuit and delivers newspapers on her old rusty bike, while thinking about the date. <br> With the money she earned she buys Anna Sui and pink yarn balls, wondering if Senpai would like her scent and the color of her knitted sweater.  <br> Sees a cute pair of high heel boots and realizes the difference in height between Senpai and her, but they are too pricy. <br> Tries them on and touches her lips while thinking “Wearing these would make me easier to get on my tip toes and reach Senpai’s lip-“ and her face becomes red. <br> She buys them without taking the labels off, so she can return them later. <br> Spends the days prior to the date knitting a sweater while smiling with the date in mind <br><br>Day of the date<br> Wakes up at 4 am to prepare herself for the date <br> Stands in front of the partially broken mirror <br> Clears her throat with cute sounds and decides to do her usual rejection rehearsal <br> "Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a b-boyfriend..." <br> Blushes and bits her tongue. <br> Spends half an hour wondering about the length of her skirt <br> Realizes her knee socks had hole and uses her sewing kit to fix them <br> Puts a buy-one-get-one-free-meal coupon for a new cafe in her wallet. <br> Leaves home early and walks to the Chiba station carrying a sports bag  <br> Arrives to the station early and her Senpai is already there. She is surprised and happy at the same time <br> Avoids being seen by him and goes to the Station to put her bag in a coin locker. Comes back to watch her Senpai waiting, takes an extra look at her notepad, "Things I want to know about Senpai today". <br> At 10:15 she decides to stop making him wait because it’s too cold </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>After the date<br> Goes to the station and gets her sports bag. Inside there are her normal clothes.  <br> Changes her clothes in the toilet and heads to the shop to return the stuff she bought <br> She goes to the supermarket because of the 6pm sales and buys half-priced meat and veggies. <br> On her way back home, she sees a promotion of free phone calls between couples and her eyes glittered, but she realizes she doesn’t have Senpai’s number and gets depressed.  <br> Back at home, she sits in the kotatsu right beside her mom because it’s too cold. Her mom serves her warm tea and she takes small sips while smiling from ear to ear <br> She chokes when her mom asks “So, when will you introduce him to me?” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, so Hachiman has 0 and YY has 1 as of Vol 4. Also i meant that Sensei did include Yui even though she never learns of the contest until Vol 8<br><br>By Vol 8, Sensei stated that Yukino and hachiman were basically tied (Hachiman ahead in pure results but Yukino ahead in terms of process/planning) but also made a statement that Yui's contributions helped as well (whatever that means)<br><br>There are 3 outstanding requests left: Hachiman's, Yukino's (to be seen what it is), and Sensei's (to change Hachiman)<br><br>Sensei will probably choose either Hachiman or Yukino to win or just chooses all of them to be the winner (cop out ending)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can honestly see a cop-out "everybody wins" ending for the contest though. It's so stupidly shonen sometimes I wonder if we're idiots for expecting anything different from Sensei of all people.</br>  <br>Disregarding that sensei is a Yukinofag, I'm pretty sure 8man will win the we'll get to see the ending of the series once he picks one of them.<br>If he uses the win to tell them "let's be friends forever" I will flip a shit</br></br>  <br>The mangaka should just start a new series with Iroha as the MC</br>  <br>IROHA A SHIT<br>A SHIT</br></br>  <br>Who would want to read a manga about a girl fucking old men for money?</br>  <br>old men?</br>  <br>who wouldn't?</br>  <br>I said Iroha, not YukiYui</br>  <br>Has any manga ever had such a plot?</br>  <br>I know</br>  <br>You looking for recommendations? <br>There's a lot of manga with that plot on  exhentai.org </br></br>  <br>No I was just curious if there was any smutty manga that held it as its main plot.</br>  <br>If she can't sell a daki, what makes you think she can sell a whole manga?</br>    <br> They haven't released her daki yet <br> Hurr durr she can't sell <br><br>Reminder that her key chain was the first to be sold out</br></br></br></br>  <br>Im sure we're inviting shitposters by attacking other girls.</br>  <br>Sorry, but that's not how you spell "third"</br>  <br>Admit it, you don't know shit about nippongo, do you?</br>  <br>IDK, but their are plenty of people who read VN's about a girl fucking old men for money.</br>  <br>topkek <br><br>I would have believed your bullshit if it wasn't <br/></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Admit it, you are blind, aren't you?</br>  <br> Maybe if I call him an EoP people will believe me! <br>The funny part is I am, but big red stickers covering part of the merch selection is universal.</br></br>  <br>Waiting for season 3 ;_;</br>  <br>/c/ is not for discussion</br>  Stop bumping this slut girl circlejerk thread, retards.

It’s true that I didn’t hate dogs or cats. If anything, it’s certain breeds that I liked. <br> It’s just cats in particular were what I liked. <br> Gentlemen, I liked cats. Gentlemen, I loved cats. I liked American shorthair cats. I liked toroiseshell cats. I liked Sphinx cats. I liked ragdolls. I liked American curl cats. I liked Scottish Fold cats. I liked Persian cats. I liked Singapuras. I liked Russian Blue cats. <br> Back alley, cat beds, cat tower, the top of a refrigerator, under the bed, on the rail of the veranda, inside a cardboard box, in a paper bag, on a person’s back, and in a futon. <br> I loved all the cats who were all over the place. <br> …Actually, it’s the bastards who abused cats that I couldn’t forgive. I wanted people who didn’t cherish life to die. I absolutely hated people who didn’t cherish life! <br><br>Alright so Hikki is neither a dog nor cat person but he prefers cats over dog.<br>His speech sounds like it's a parody of something though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Do you feel it?

You guys can always ignore this thread instead of being masochists</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> May 2nd <br>First appearance of Iroha was <br> Aired: Apr 17, 2015 (JST)  <br><br>A little too soon, may be?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They can't escape Yahari, so they'll post even if it's in a thread about a girl they're jealous of</br>   every thread has dozens of shitposts about Yukino being a shit <br> I get warned for posting tranny yukinoshitter cosplayer <br>Nice one, Yukinofag janitor-san</br></br>  <br> implying this isn't just a continuation of the old threads </br>  <br> Posting 3d at all <br>You deserve a ban instead.</br></br>    <br>You don't have to be a Yukinofag to not want that shit, I hope you get banned</br>  <br>Too soon and merch bought mostly by people who commutes with the monorail, so they would probably buy Yukino for her looks and Yui for her genki boobs</br>  <br>the other thread was dead with only 9 posts.</br>    <br>That's not how you repel Yukinofags. That will invite them instead. You are deserved to get that warning.</br>  <br>Yui and Yukino appeared in 2013 (anime), it's not so surprising the locals know about them.<br><br>Nobody would buy a 8man keychain though. Maybe only for collectors.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Check'dはす~</br></br>   she will never be real <br>Fuck this gay earth.</br>  <br>The "other thread" was made with this one already up, so nobody saw the sense to migrate just because Irohafags are pretending they get to have their circle jerk.</br>  <br>That's the truth alright</br>  <br> you will never be constantly rejected by your sly kohai </br>   After checking that, Isshiki turned towards me. “Okay, scratch the movie, why don’t we play table tennis instead?” <br><br> “That’s fine with me, but won’t those shoes make it a bit hard?” I said, while looking at Isshiki’s boots. Isshiki stopped, made fixated looks at her feet, and then directed her gaze at my face. <br><br> Her cherubic appearance with her mouth agape from surprise or shock made me realize again that Isshiki was a girl younger than me. <br><br> Her curious face that was looking my way was on the verge of saying something. <br><br> “Wh-What?” <br><br> “Nothing… I just thought it was a little unexpected for you to be so observant…” <br><br> “I can tell without looking since I’m looking at a different height than usual,” I said. <br><br> Isshiki took a step towards me as if purposely confirming that and faced me. In taking a step back to open up our distance, Isshiki would raise her eyebrow and close that step again. Apparently, she was telling me to stay still. I slightly leaned backwards and Isshiki looked up at me. And with breaths spilling out through her smiling lips, she weaved her words. <br><br> “Oh, that’s true. Your height’s much closer than before.” <br><br> Due to the close proximity of our faces compared to normal, I instinctively swallowed my breath when I noticed her glossy, smiling lips. <br><br> As I stood there unable to say anything, even Isshiki was bewildered by our close distance and looked away with slightly red cheeks. Then, she looked at me timidly and acted shy to play it off. <br><br> “…Well, I guess you can just rent some shoes then.” I averted my eyes from Isshiki and took a step towards the bowling alley. Isshiki let out a short reply in affirmation and followed me from behind. <br><br> Jeez, just how sly can this junior of mine be…? <br><br>10.5 OVA when? I need to see that date animated before I die.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't post if you are so butthurt</br>  <br> her glossy, smiling lips. <br>I don't have my 10,5 with me here to verify the wording, but I'm pretty sure the correct TL is "alluring", not "glossy".<br><br> I need to see that date animated before I die. <br>Don't we all?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice try but no</br>  <br>The wording is the same as the onebused in WW's twitter and the correct translation should be alluring</br>  <br> &gt;I need to see that date animated before I die. <br> Don't we all? <br>It's a dilemma for me, on one hand I want to see Iroha being cute, on the other hand it will make Irohafags happy, and I don't want them to be happy</br></br></br>  <br> Apparently, she was telling me to stay still <br>And he obeyed just by the "apparently"? Your AT.Field is becoming weak 8man</br></br>  <br> &gt;Her curious face that was looking my way was on the verge of saying something. <br>What was she intended to say, I wonder.</br></br>  <br>Blessed be the internet.<br> 艶めいて <br>It's indeed "alluring", 8man is too lewd.</br></br></br>  <br> 艶めいて </br>  <br>I want to kill that fucking cunt.</br>   Now then, Isshiki-sensei’s scoring continued. Isshiki abruptly squeezed her right hand into a fist and lightly punched me in the side. “You lose fifty points for accepting a girl’s invitation so easily.” <br><br> “You’re the one that called me… Wait, now my points are at zero.” <br><br> After poking my side, Isshiki went a step ahead, stuck up a finger, and coughed with her chest out. “Well, I had fun, so I’ll give you ten points as a bonus.” <br><br> “…Gee, thanks for that.” <br><br> “So how was it for you, senpai?” Isshiki asked modestly when we arrived at the rotary that continued to a short flight of stairs. Since she was facing down, I couldn’t see her expression, so I didn’t understand her question for a moment. <br><br> “Well, I guess it’s like that for me… I’m a little tired, though.” <br><br> “Do you have to be that honest about how tired you are…? I mean, it’s fine and all. It just means you were actually being a proper partner for me!” <br><br> Isshiki’s raised face had an energetic smile. I ended up making a stiff face to her typical slyness. When Isshiki saw my wry smile, Isshiki puffed her cheeks in displeasure. <br><br> “What’s with that super pain-in-the-butt face of yours…?” Isshiki’s cheeks swelled and she briskly walked ahead turning away. She stated in a passing and sulking voice, “There’s no girl that’s not a pain in the butt, you know.” <br><br> Ahh, that was surprisingly believable. I lightly shrugged my shoulders and increased my pace after Isshiki. <br><br> “In any case, today turned out to be a good learning experience. Thank you very much.” <br><br> Isshiki lightly bowed, honestly expressing her appreciation. Taken aback by her earnest and mannerly behavior, I replied back awkwardly in a fluster. Isshiki lifted her face and laughed in amusement. <br><br> “…Senpai, make sure to keep today in mind, okay?” <br><br> She had a kind gaze, tinged slightly with strictness. <br><br> “…Yeah. Well, you know, thanks for today.” <br><br>How is she so sly?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> yfw he spoiled the ending </br>  <br>8man never had defenses when it comes to Iroha. <br>She's like that stealth plane that goes undetected on radars and when people realize what happened, it's too late.</br></br>  <br> Now then, Isshiki-sensei’s scoring continued. Isshiki abruptly squeezed her right hand into a fist and lightly punched me in the side. “You lose fifty points for accepting a girl’s invitation so easily.” <br>Every fucking time. I want to see her face at that moment</br></br>  I feel like this thread is not complete without the denialfag, where is that sucker?  <br>When 8man ends up with either of the YY, if they let Iroha stay around him it won't end well for them</br>  <br>Iroha doesn't have any feelings for 8man.</br>  <br>Unlike Irohafags, Iroha isn't a waste of oxygen, so she'll respect the victory of whichever YY takes the 8bowl.</br>  <br>Yui has no romantic feelings for 8man<br>Iroha' feelings are not genuine.<br><br>In truth, the dynamic between 8man and Iroha is not that of senpai and kouhai but more of older brother and younger sister bridged together with the help of this pairing.<br>To 8man, Iroha is another little sister whom he must protect and also enjoys her company. For Iroha, 8man is an older brother she can rely on, and also enjoys his company.<br>Iroha's main love interest will always be Hayato, and 8man will be her wingman because they are platonic lovers who resemble more a pair of siblings than romantic partners and the LN clearly demonstrates this.<br><br>tl;dr the relationship between 8 and iroha is platonic and iroha triggers 8mans oniichan instincts while in turn triggerin iroha's imouto antics.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Iroha isn't a waste of oxygen <br>Stay deluded irohafag</br></br>  <br>Yui would be clueless and let 8man hang out with Yukino and Iroha when in reality they're going to be teasing him<br>Yukino wouldn't let it fly for sure</br></br>  <br>He's not even translating the LN anymore, do you really expect him to translate the second manga series?</br>  <br>I feel much better now.</br>  <br>Do you really think so? I mean her sly flirting is basically all her interaction with 8man, she won't just change so drastically.</br>  <br>Iroha won't mind being 8man's mistress as long as she can still tease him in front of YY</br>  If Irohachiman had a daughter together and she acts cute like her mom and her aunty Komachi, would 8man commit a crime?  <br> Isshiki lightly bowed, honestly expressing her appreciation. Taken aback by her earnest and mannerly behavior, I replied back awkwardly in a fluster. Isshiki lifted her face and laughed in amusement. <br> “…Senpai, make sure to keep today in mind, okay?” <br><br><br>dokidoki.jpg</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean if he waits until she can give consent it won't be a crime.<br>It'll be Zaimokuza's daughter so it's not incest or anything</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Please continue with the other volumes, too.<br>Everybody deserves to be saved, even a certain Ice Queen in Volume 6.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Once she turns 15  ..maybe. </br>  <br>Didn't know we were talking about Hayama.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128553600 <br>Zaimokuza.

I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the FGL Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret crackings on SERN, and I have over 300 Committee kills. I am trained in temporal warfare and I’m the top scientist in the entire Future Gadget Laboratory's staff. You are nothing to me but just another test subject. I will excise your frontal lobe with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the space-time continuum and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, baka. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, chuunibyou. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my Phonewave (name subject to change). Not only am I extensively trained in temporal combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Future Gadget Laboratory and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, pervert.</br>  <br>zombie thread?</br>  How are you celebrating?  <br><br> tfw you will never eat the gel banana </br></br>  <br>Listening to this</br>  <br><br>Favorite song?</br></br>  <br> being this undank <br>You disappoint Kurisu, anon.</br></br>  <br><br>Accidentally planning to finish the True End tonight. My playing every other day just happened to coincide with her birthday. Worked out perfectly.</br></br>  <br>I'll probably have a wank later.</br>  <br>Can't decide. Uchuu Engineer, Skyclad no Kansokusha or Cycle.</br>  <br>I'm replaying Steins;Gate. I forgot how much Okabe checks Kurisu out at the start of the game.</br>  <br>Can you blame him?</br>  <br>N-Not really. She's cute.</br>  <br>Listen to some dank beats while editing flawed pictures of Kurisu. The last thread showed me many examples of near perfect artworks.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3El<wbr>L8hdQD_4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>This picture is brilliant.</br>  <br><br> Cycle <br><br>So many good feelings from that song.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly.<br><br><br>It was drawn by huke after all.</br></br></br></br>      When are the PQube and 5pb. panels at Otakon? When is Barrel Titor gonna message Kevin again? When will we have ANSWERS?    <br> Almost 4 years ago <br>I- I can't...</br></br>  <br><br>At least you were lucky enough to participate in it. Have some crappy violin playing to calm your nerves.<br><br>http://vocaroo.com/i/s0TQtV6IBHXe</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's cute, thanks.<br><br>But I didn't really mean participating in that, more like how long it's been since the show aired and how much time has passed in general. We'll really be here forever, huh?</br></br></br>  <br>That's okay. It's fun talking with you guys.</br>  <br>I guess you're right.<br><br>Happy birthday, Kurisu.</br></br></br>  <br>There's no shame in continuing to enjoy yourself here. It's a pretty nice place to be.</br>  <br>Best S;G related thing Huke has drawn.</br>  <br><br>To answer your question: http://vocaroo.com/i/s1WdWYlVhIst<br><br>I need to learn third position. Either that or my left hand's pinky is fucked somehow.<br><br>I'm relatively new compared to most everyone else who's seen the show I think. I'm just glad there's others who can appreciate it with me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>When did you first get into the show/SciAdv?</br></br>  <br>Keep up the good work.<br><br><br>Back when it first started airing, but I've been meaning to rewatch it for sometime now.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Have you seen the VN, OVA, or movie?</br></br>  <br>Read the VN a bit when there was a fan translation going for it (?) and I've seen the OVA plus movie. But it indeed has been pretty long time since I last took a look at anything S;G related, so a rewatch would be in place.</br>  <br>There's an official release now.</br>  <br>DON'T REWATCH IT. If you've forgotten a lot of the anime, that means your experience with the VN will be even better. I made the mistake of re-marathoning the anime before I started reading the VN, and it made the considerable parts of the VN that got adapted 1:1 in the anime completely tedious, since I remembered every little thing was gonna happen in them. There's an official translation for the VN now that's a lot better than the fan translation, go read that before you rewatch the anime.</br>  <br><br>Official VN translation is here. S;G 0 is on the horizon. It's a good time to be a SciAdv fan, though no Noah is disappointing.</br></br>  <br> no Noah <br>What?</br></br>  <br><br>Steiner said that corporate opinion was still out on a Noah localisation. Current trends are pointing towards Chaos;Child being the localization. As I recall, it was annouced that C;C along with Psycho Pass are coming over to the XboxOne.</br></br>  <br>I should perhaps step in and say that I've made it a point to refuse Chaos;Child without Chaos;Head being a preceding factor. PQube is aware of our stance on that.</br>  <br>Both Chaos;Heads?</br>  <br>Which is why they decided to release Hiyoku Renri no Darling with Zakobot's translation instead.</br>  <br>WINKEL PLS</br>  <br>Please no.</br>  <br>Damn it Blick we weren't meant to say anything before the reveal.</br>  <br>By upscaling images of her and drinking Dr.Pepper while listening to the OSTs.<br/></br>  <br>Oi, whats up with the RD Kickstarter,<br>is there some bonus if you back the game?</br></br>  <br><br><br>That's cruel.</br></br></br>     Precure Thread   <br><br>NEVER EVER CURENIGGERS</br></br>  <br>Shit it works. Thanks, that was some advanced hacking.<br><br>Spoilers said not before August, if I recall correctly.</br></br></br>      See you next week.<br> Bring back Smile. </br>  War, huh, yeah<br>What is it good for<br>Absolutely nothing<br>Uh-huh</br></br></br>  <br>Lelei eventually makes her spells more powerful after reading a schoolbook and actually understanding simple principles like combustion. Magic would be scary powerful.<br><br>And then you have lots of creatures and demi-humans that are pretty dangerous as they are.</br></br></br>  <br>Because  ____no spoonfeeding____faggot. </br>  <br>Agreed that her particular line of questioning was stupid. But that was due mostly to a lack of facts.<br><br>In any real scenario lawmakers would have been extensively briefed behind closed doors about what they were dealing with before public questioning.<br><br>But JSDF and their hawkish backers in the Diet shrewdly allowed Rori and her group to drop info bombs like their ages and such to make the female Diet member look like a fool and shut up all criticism.<br><br>And now everybody's on their side.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because the gods are scared.</br>   Mage looks like a Rei clone <br> Her name is ReREI </br>  So apparently this shit's coming out.  <br>SAHARA WATARU IS FUCKING AMAZING I LOVE EVERYTHING HE DOES</br>  <br>Burrito is probably like Ed from FMA, to cocky and tsundere but at the same time too awkward and shy for romance.</br>  <br>Except there are a lot of shows that do that, especially comedies.</br>  <br>hes SHIT</br>  <br>He's also a manlet.</br>  Slowly but surely ch 38 coming together.  <br>The only one that will possibly die is Kurumi, with Miki having to kill her.<br><br>The other 3 are completely safe from a story telling standpoint, or it wouldn't make any fucking sense. Yuuri will probably cause trouble before snapping back to reality and that will be it.</br></br></br>   hating on glorious Rii <br><br>I'll fight you, every single one of you hotheads</br></br>  <br>Best candidates for that would be unisluts at this point.</br>  <br>[/spoiler] Oh so it was her. Still, given Kurumi's current condition, and Miki reminiscing about Kei, I'm kinda worried about best girl. [/spoiler]<br><br><br>I wonder how the guys are gonna come into play, given their close proximity to the girls.<br><br>Just please don't die Miki ;_;<br><br><br>I hope so. I need my Miki figure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I doubt it, since the series doesn't sell a lot, but I would really like a Yuuri one.<br><br>I think a Yuki Nendoroid wouldn't feel so weird though, or maybe a 4 figure set of Nendoroid mini, with the whole club.</br></br></br>  Straight Outta Skellig  Edition <br><br>Predict, circlejerk, what have you, 338:<br><br> http://www.mangaumaru.com/archives<wbr>/472642</wbr> </br></br></br></br>    <br>Serpico can't become an apostle because the only thing he could sacrifice is Farnese and he wouldn't do that</br>  <br> How strong were the things that made him go into a rage that makes Guts little tempers look like childsplay? <br>Do you even have to wonder?<br><br>Skull Knight was singlehandedly fighting the God Hand. All five of them.<br>To be fair, Guts can probably do the same now with the Berserker armor.<br><br>Skull Knight seems to be a hybrid of something keeping him alive. Puck said that he felt 'elvish' or something which suggest that his soul or body was transfered after he lost all the blood in his body. The eyes past the skull of Skull Knight really seems like someone is looking inside, leaving you unable to see inside because there is nothing inside but his eyes and soul.<br><br>What I find more interesting is Skull knight's horse. It reminds me of Alexander's horse that makes Skull Knight even more of an insane opponent.<br><br>What I also find very interesting is that barely any records of Gaiseric remains yet the story that he lost all of his blood was so powerful that it remained 1000 years later. That must have been some insane fight.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It definitely gets better, but god damn the Osaka arc was absolutely weird. I was good but at the same time terrible. I mean you had 2-3 chapters or something for just ONE fight against one enemy. After that things got better for a while, but the only way to read Gantz is by marathoning it since it's over. The reason most people dislike or hate the ending is because the author shat out shorter, mediocre final chapters (each one had half the number of pages as before), which felt rushed and highly unsatisfactory for everyone who was paying attention to it.</br>  <br> &gt;mfw if Serpico finds a behelit and goes apostle to have a chance against Guts in all his rage. <br>That's fucking boring and shit.<br> lel, people die and become evil just because <br>How cliche and a waste.<br><br>Plus no one can become an Apostle now that the God Hand are on Earth. I doubt you can summon them anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>I see. I'll check that out. Thanks.</br></br>  <br><br>Her swimsuit. Himeko wears a sweater to the beach. She just rolls that way.</br></br>  <br>More like she's getting changed into her swimsuit.</br>       It's time.     <br>The anime won't cover why Goldof is like that nor will it reach to Adlet being yandere.</br>  <br>I feel you on a deeply spiritual level</br>  <br> Hope you enjoy the delicious suffering </br>  Volleyball slut is coming.  I finished watching CCS the other day and it was pretty fucking satisfying. I can't help but wonder why the expansion/conclusion movies to so many TV series now are so terrible in comparison to the series itself.</blockquote>]
