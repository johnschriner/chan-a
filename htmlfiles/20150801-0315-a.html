It might simply be some revenge for before. There's no indication there's any sort of emotional energy/despair business actually happening there, his body is damaged but he's about as expressionless as ever.</br>  A reminder that Rebellion is a way better movie then EoE.  <br>She's a complex character, thats why.</br>  <br>She went through a lot, thats why. Homura is a very different girl from how she started out until the end of the movie, going through a wide variety of changes.<br><br>Bear in mind that she repeated time a lot. As she said, quite well "I've come to embrace even my pain." Homura has become of the most interesting characters I've seen in the past few years of anime, and thats no small feat.</br></br></br>  <br>That scene still gets to me<br><br>People can hate Rebellion all they want, but I thought it was absolutely fantastic.</br></br></br>  <br>These aren't really emotions or states of mind as they are outward appearances.</br>  https://<span>youtu.be/Mj92Kv0z66I?t=115  [ ]  <br> modokuh </br>  <br>Among other things, Mami = "Mommy".</br>  <br>It is states of mind.<br><br>Consider that:<br><br>Original Homura - timid, overly emotional individual who has a difficulty making choices<br><br>Series Homura - repressed girl suffering from a traumatic experience, but who nonetheless perservers to achieve a specific goal<br><br>Series Homura - stoic girl who fights in the memory of a friend she ahs lsot, but in the hopes that she'd meet her again<br><br>Witch Homura - overcome by grief, facing a possibility of being contained, has sacrificed herself to ensure the safety of her love<br><br>Demon Homura - finally having a chance to meet Madoka again, has stolen Madoka's powers and has assumed a form.

How, and with what, is anyone's guess.</br>  <br>I liked Homura from the beginning because  she can stop time. </br>  <br>I don't think she put 'nerd' or 'sexy danger' as a label or 'state of mind' but what she thinks of Homura at that stage.<br><br>And I'm not gonna lie. The calculating, smooth and insidious Homura is incredibly sexy.<br><br>Whenever I think of Demon Homura, I play this music: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5R-<wbr>6yhV2-1c</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I liked Homura from the start because  black haired edgy girls are my fetish </br>  <br>She literally said that she needs kyubey to deal with all the despair she caused.</br>  The world Homura created is unstable and will crash very soon. Such is the world made upon selfish desires. When the time comes Godoka will rise among mortal men and give Magical girls eternal life.  <br>I'm fine with that.<br><br> I just want Madoka to forgive Homura, and for the two of them to work tigetehr as Light and Dark, as per what the Universe needs </br></br></br>  <br>No, what she said was she still needed him around to do what he's always done.</br>  <br>I don't know, Kyubey wanting to run away would discontinue the creation of new magical girls were they allowed to get away with it.<br><br>Also, did she actually say that she created despair? I only remember her being vague about it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Right, sorry. I wanted to say all the despair he caused.</br></br>  <br><br>The problem is it's an unintentional homophone. To a native English speaker, Mommy is just a weird name for a girl. You don't name people after positions within a family, especially when they're occupied by someone else. It's like having a grandson named Grandpa. (Remember, we don't see her name written as "Mami" in a dub nor do we have a whole lot of context.)<br><br>I don't have a pronunciation solution, that's really something the dub should have worked out, but anything other than "Mommy" would do.</br></br></br></br>  Could it be that she is making Kyubey forget about her unusual behavior? I mean, they didn't remember anything about the time when Madoka rewrote the universe, so it could very well be the same thing once more. However, given her new role as a Goddess on Earth she may be required to do different things from what a MG would do, such as sit on top of the hill overlooking the city. The behavior does not fit with what is expected of magical girls, Kyubey keeps noticing it and Homu has to erase it again and again everytime QB sneaks up on her.<br><br><br>Homura's wish is not any more selfish than Madoka's.<br><br><br>There's nothing about Homura's actions that requires forgiveness.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Just listen to the megucas pronounce her name and say it like that.  <br>She oretty much has decieved and imprisoned her best friend in a lie.<br><br>But she ahd good intentions, so I can't really fault her.<br><br><br><br>I kind of want to see Sayaka be the one to try and restore Madoka's mind.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Season 3 when  <br> Never </br>  <br> change the universe where everyone lives in <br> call it a lie <br>Might as well say that Madoka did this to Homura, then, because Homura was 'imprisoned' in a strange new world completely different from the one she had spent the most time in (and that she happened to be the only on to remember). Even the reasoning behind it was similar: Madoka made up her mind upon learning that Homura was stuck in a hopeless cycle of fight and failure against Walpurgis, thus it could be said that a good part of her motivation was about Homura's well being, alongside that of her other friends.</br></br></br>    <br>Homura's nose in this is horrid.</br>  <br> this is based off what <br><br>i can understand the first point being questionable but the second point seems pretty clear. Sayaka and Charlotte came back and Homura mentions that she somehow pulled all off them out with Madoka. All off them would include all those other witches we see Godoka hanging out with in the movie wich she would have logically did a law of the wheel on just like Sayaka and Charlotte</br></br></br>  <br>We don't see anyone but Sayaka and Nagisa, so how can you be so sure it's all of them?</br>  <br>People hate Rebellion? I have avoided Madoka threads until I watched it and it was fantastic, all the suffering of the series &amp; loved the artstyle in the scenes where Homu &amp; Kyoko try to take the bus to the other city</br>  <br>Homura was interesting before she was a sympathetic character<br><br>The only character I didn't like till later on was Kyoko, she was incredibly unappealing on introduction and the early constant eating was irritating</br></br></br>  So why do people like Madoka so much when I found the whole thing to be pretty mediocre? The art style was cool I guess.  Is it yurifags?   <br>Generally, the people who hated Rebelliion had a fundamental misunderstanding of Homura's character and believe that there was no way the Homura they believed in could have done the thing she did.</br>  <br>So Rebellion is /a/'s Char's Counterattack? Autists completely missed the point of a character and call the work shit because they can't understand that the character didn't magically change like they wanted<br><br>That makes sense</br></br></br>  <br>B-but Char was mostly over his shit in Zeta and then he suddenly wasn't in CCA</br>  <br> B-but Char was mostly over his shit in Zeta <br>Oh look another retard</br></br>  <br>You're just trying to excuse Urobuchi's bad writing</br>  <br>People are allowed to like things you don't, my main man. You don't have to understand it and you certainly don't need to belittle them by saying "it's only because of X".</br>  <br> People hate Rebellion? <br>Are you new or something? Rebellion sure as fuck ain't no sacred cow here especially since it's mostly just a cash-in sequel by Aniplex. <br><br><br> Y-y-y-y-y-you just don't get her c-c-c-c-c-c-c-complex character  <br><br>I love this meme</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I figured that she just beat the living crap out of him and the last shoot is just his reaction to the beating.</br>  <br>Hype?</br>  <br> mostly over his shit <br>Char was clearly depressed and clawing desperately for a new purpose because his life had been only revenge. And then his plans were completely destroyed by Zeta's end<br><br>Not hard to figure out what he'd decide to do next<br><br>If you're really finding it hard to understand, watch the ending cutscene to that PS1 Zeta game where Char muses on his defeat and his truest comrade Kamille being sent into a coma. It's on youtube but I don't remember if it's subtitled</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm a lot more intrested in finding out if there is any consequences for resetting the Universe twice.  <br>Rebellion was pure art, I enjoyed it with every cell of my body.</br>  <br><br>My own fault for falling for hype rumors when I knew little about the series.</br></br>  <br>More like lack of writing.<br>Is it too much to ask for him to do a proper build up to what happens in the ending rather than cut from a teary eyed Homura to her being all smug now that her master plan was about to happen?</br></br>  <br>The signs were all there, you just had to be paying attention</br>  <br>Foreshadowing =/= build up. Also it was too big of a snoozefest for an healthy individual to be paying close attention to all that shit.</br>  <br>She actually fucked everything up. Kyubeys holding the curses does nothing for the universe. They are like an appendix.<br><br>When magical girls transform into witches due to overwhelming amounts of curses in their soul gem, they release a massive burst of energy into the universe. However there is a balance of hope and curse, and Homura removed the curse recycling system essentially.<br><br>In the end of rebellion Homura states that " Once all the wraiths are gone, perhaps I will be your enemy" She's acknowledging the fact that curses in this new world are going to run out. No curses and no magical girls = no energy creation.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>generally hectic sketches of the nature seen in his eyes means a curse in this series</br>  <br>Because she is the best. This is now the obligatory daily homu thread. Other magicas welcome</br>  <br>wraiths embodied that in the new world and they generally weren't drawn like that</br>  <br>The wraiths had been previously defined as something that exists due to the curses harbored by humanity as a whole, meaning they exist as long as people exist. Or rather, curses will always exist, be it in the form of witches, wraiths or something. And magical girls are needed to fight such creatures - that's why Homura prevents QB from running away and leaving their system behind. To sum it up, there's not enough info to say that wraiths no longer exist, no longer are being born, or whatever.<br><br>Also, don't forget that Homura says that she would become their enemy when it came down to the time of destroying that reality or something. But isn't that pretty much the ideal world for her and what she had fought so hard to achieve? Homura herself taking it down makes no sense as of now.</br></br></br>  <br>I dont know, i have my doubts that Kyubey's etropy story isnt all one big lie. Hell if the incubators are really out to extend the universe's lifespan as long as possible, you would think they would always prefer to have tons of potential future energy as opposed to just getting a large sum of it then calling it quits.<br><br>As seen in the timeline right before the series, they were content with getting Madoka's energy then letting the whole planet be destroyed, which would mean sacrificing tons of future magical girls which would, eventually, pass up Madoka's energy output in the long run, and there for be better for the universe.<br><br>If they're content with a limitied quota of energy fast, as opposed to doing everything possible to make the cycle continue forever, then it doesn't seem like they are actually trying to keep the universe afloat, as that obviously isnt going to work with a limited sum of energy if the entropy thing is true.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If they have zero emotion, why do they suffer from curses based on negative human emotion?</br>  <br>Were Kyubey not emotionless, I would say in that scene he seemed really eager for completing his quota and going back to his home planet now that it had been done with.</br>  <br>well it helps that she does mention the last time we see the incubators, she mentioned that she would need them to manage the curses. So its seems logical to assume that this has something to do with that.</br>  <br> she would need them to manage the curses <br>That's basically what they've always done. Contract magical girl, use them to acquire grief seeds/cubes, rinse-repeat</br></br>  <br>i mean, considering that this is a series were emotion based energy can result in the destruction of a planet, i dont think even a rock would be fine if you fill it with curses. Shit still has an actual density of evil aura that fucks shit up</br>  <br>its up to interpretation i guess. But i dont feel like the incubators really mangaed the curses, they just make sure the cycle continues, they mostly dont meddle in what the wish or resulting curse does to universe outside of gaging energy output.</br>  <br> law of the wheel </br>    I want to stick my dick in crazy.  <br>I want to stick a spear in you.</br>  <br>jesus christ do you monitor all Madoka threads waiting for that one post?</br>  <br>Mornin' Apple~chi.</br>  <br>I just woke up to the thread.<br><br><br>Good morning.</br></br></br></br>    <br>There's a chance that at least one kyuubey can experience emotions. I remember that it is considered a mental illness to the incubators so I'm betting that the kyuubey(s) we know who recruit magical girls in Mitakihara can experience emotions. <br>I'm expecting despair-powered incubators to fuck shit up. Pretty predictable, I know, but at this point what else can they do besides become monsters?</br></br>  <br>Maybe Homura gave Kyubey that illness. Little guy looks traumatized.</br>  <br> but at this point what else can they do besides become monsters? <br>A superhero we deserve</br></br>  <br>I always thought that was what happened. Homura forced them to take care of all the nightmares, something they are not suited to do. They became mad thus they developed emotions. Poor cat aliens, all they wanted was to fuck the second land of thermodynamics. critters.</br>  Mahou shoujo Kyubey soon.  <br>I don't hate it. I just feel it's a bit pretentious in how it teases the audience at the end by not explaining anything. It's the same reason I bust out laughing every time someone praises Evangelion for being anything more than it was. Abstract symbolism is a poor way to tell a story.</br>  <br>How about Mahou Shoujo Kyubike.</br>  <br>Cars are better</br>  I guess the difference between Madoka's universe rewrite and Homura's universe rewrite is that Madoka made her wish out of selfless feelings - all she wanted to do was save all the magical girls from eternal despair, not just Homura. Homura, on the other hand, wanted to save Madoka and only Madoka from eternal despair, which was a wish founded in raw, corrupt love and not selflessness.  <br> yfw incubators are taking shape of multiple vehicle to make contracts with even more humans <br><br> All the more reasons to crash those vehicles. </br></br></br>  Spot it  <br>Berserk is full of art errors</br>  <br>Left arm</br>  That's a panel line, if you're referring to his right arm.   it feels like decades have passed   Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #1<br><br>Remember to relax and take it easy.</br></br>  Good morning everyone.

That's not how it works.</br></br>  <br>Your waifu is cute with long hair.</br>  Yamato wearing any sports clothing  <br>I rather like her more casual hair down and dress look. I find it wonderful that Gwen can look amazing either way.</br>  Requesting my waifu in either:<br>Her lingerie in the bottom left of the reference in this pose.

Bought it the second time and psn and beat it again. I enjoyed it each time and I will surely enjoy it each and every time they decide to release or remake it. My favorite game of all time, every time, it will never be topped.</br>  Requesting Tsukihi eating this ice cream https://i.imgur.com/7mgP7L8.jpg trying to not make it fall  <br>I never remember the lag being a real issue for me, but the fact they're redoing the battle system slightly makes me excited.</br>  <br><br>Any requests or notice any issues before I go onto painting? Won't backtrack after wards. Criticism also welcome.</br></br>  Any collages being worked on?  Mook translation:  http://aitaikimochi.tumblr.com/post<wbr>/125504782946<br/></wbr> <br><br>Where were you when RinHaru finally became canon?</br></br>  Why is RinHaru so one-sided?  <br>GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY</br>  WTF is this? Is it official?  <br>Only Rin can have such crazy dreams.</br>  <br> you will never suck Haru's mermaid blood </br>  <br>yes, it's official</br>  <br>Wow, Kyoani went all out.</br>  <br>BIG FAT ASS<br>I<br>G<br><br>F<br>A<br>T<br><br>A<br>S<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's Utsumi's official doujinshi.</br>  Huh. I always did like this more than Makoto and Haru. Are the Makotofags butthurt yet?  <br>Haru's ass is the best ass.</br>  <br><br>Very butthurt.<br><br> DO RINHARU SHIPPERS ACTUALLY THINK RIN ATTEMPTING TO BITE HARU’S FLESH OFF TO THE POINT HARU IS IN TEARS IS CUTE OR SEXY? <br><br> DO THEY REALLY NOT SEE HOW FUCKED UP THAT IS <br><br> YOU. PEOPLE. ARE. FUCKING. PSYCHO. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sasuga GayAni</br>  <br>#LoveWins <br>Finally</br></br>  <br> all that salt <br>Bitter shipperfag tears are the best.</br></br>  Still a better mook story than NagiRei.  <br>What did Kisumi do to deserve this?</br>  <br> What did Kisumi do to deserve this? <br>Be a homewrecker.</br></br>  <br>Don't bring it back, anon, just erase it from your memory.</br>   Haru: Perfect size <br>Makoto: On the large size<br>Rei: Compact<br>Nagisa: 2 smallish guns</br></br></br>  <br>That's from the mook? Did they just throw in whatever in it?</br>  <br>Rin: Perfect size<br>Momo: Compact<br>Nitori: Pretty large<br>Sousuke: Massive</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that from the mook? Why is there so much random shit in there?</br>  <br> Sousuke: Massive </br>  <br>Yes it was in the mook.</br>  <br>Nagisa CONFIRMED for having two dicks.</br>  <br>How else are you going to write your own fanfics about the boys pleasuring Utsumi if you don't know their dick sizes?</br>  <br>Two small dicks though</br>  <br><br>Not sure why but at least we got meido Rin out of this.</br></br>  <br>And here is Kissme.</br>  <br>Oh wow, I'm impressed KyoAni.</br>  <br>At last, she goes full power.</br>  What does "mook" mean? I'm still confused about this term.  <br>This mook was a surprisingly decent read. I would have enjoyed it more if I actually gave a shit about RinHaru but it was objectively one of the best mook stories, just for that part where Rin drinks Haru's blood and turns into Hulk. I would probably put it on par with MomoAi in terms of the story, myself.</br>  <br>Magazine + Book I think.</br>  <br>Vampirism?</br>  <br>Nope, cannibalism.</br>   the mook actually wasn't absolute shit <br>Color me surprised.</br>  <br>Yeah, it was pretty okay and I don't care about the ship at all.</br>  Alternate translation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1fI_M3uBNwaXmcgTbKcDSjwt3CyG_B_rd_J<wbr>jXaycsZTY/preview?sle=true</wbr></wbr>  <br>I feel like some books were longer than the others.</br>  <br>Yeah, I think the MakoHaru mook story was still the longest but this one felt pretty long too.</br>  Some translations for the Rediscovery book here:  http://kudouusagi.tumblr.com/tagged<wbr>/Free%21-rediscovery-book</wbr>   <br>I don't get why they didn't set a quota of pages for each pairing, this comes across as kinda unfair.</br>  <br> tumblr </br>  <br>Always nice to know we're in such good company both here and in the afterlife.</br>  <br>Did you want them to spend 50 pages on MomoAi?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>I don't get your point.</br>  <br>The MomoAi mook was surprisingly good so sure, why not.</br>  Rank the mooks  <br>That would actually have been fun.<br>I wish they hade made the NagiRei one only one page long so all we would have had would have been Nagisa playing around on the planet. We would never have had to suffer Rei telling boring stories or that idiotic robot reveal or the pointless drama.</br></br>  <br>My favorite mook &gt; shit &gt; you're favorite mook</br>  <br>I enjoyed the MomoAi mook so I wouldn't mind more of it at all.</br>  <br><br>Makoto and Haru had 10 pages, Rin and Haru had 8, everyone else had 6.</br></br>  <br>SouRin &gt; RinHaru = MomoAi &gt; MakoHaru &gt;&gt;&gt; NagiRei</br>  <br>See, why didn't they make 6 pages for each pairing, since this seems to be what they were going for initially.</br>  <br>MomoAi &gt; SouRin &gt; HaruRin &gt; MakoHaru &gt; NagiRei</br>  <br>SouRin &gt; MomoAi = RinHaru &gt; MakoHaru &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NagiRei</br>  <br>MomoAi &gt; SouRin &gt; HaruRin = MakoHaru &gt; shit &gt; NagiRei</br>  <br>SouRin &gt; MomoAi = HaruRin &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; MakoHaru &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NagiRei.</br>  <br>MomoAi &gt; RinHaru &gt; SouRin = MakoHaru, NagiRei</br>  <br>MomoAi &gt; MakoHaru &gt; HaruRin &gt; SouRin &gt; NagiRei</br>   people still don't understand the NagiRei mook was a masterpiece   <br>Maybe they made the MakoHaru mook longer to make it up to the fujos since the mook was delayed a few months. And then RinHaru mook was a bit longer too since they were the last to get one and for the longest time people thought there would be no RinHaru mook.</br>  <br>2deep4them</br>  <br>SouRin &gt; MomoAi = HaruRin &gt; MakoHaru &gt;&gt;Shit&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NagiRei</br>  <br>Ignore those bigots, they just don't understand the pure love between a human and his sexbot.</br>  I'm glad everyone enjoyed the SouRin mook so much since that's about all you'll be getting from KyoAni for a while.  <br>If this is all I'll be getting from kyoani then I'm content enough.</br>  <br>That's all everyone except for MakoHarufags will be getting from KyoAni in the next months. The High Speed movie is coming so it will be all MakoHaru from now on.</br>  <br>I'm too anxious about tomorrow to care about that.</br>  <br>The mook out last year and there's been a couple or things after that.</br>  First Rin had a fantasy about Haru biting his shoulder and then his head off in High Speed, now this. Rin this isn't normal.  <br>What are you anxious about? We already know we won't get birthday voice messages.</br>  <br> too anxious about tomorrow <br>Why?</br></br>  <br>Rin was a weird child.</br>  <br>Underwent some trauma after he got rejected by his husbando.</br>  <br><br> Trigger discipline <br>And hold that gun properly, Sosuke. You gonna drop it.<br><br><br> mook <br> muːk/ <br> noun US informal <br> a stupid or incompetent person. <br> "These mooks were made by mooks" <br><br><br>Yes, it was the best one. Had the best nakama feeling and stayed in universe without going full Bollywood scifi.<br><br><br>Those were official? I somehow thought they were fanart due to the lines and shadows the first time I saw them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I have to ask...<br>Teacher or Gou, or Teach/Gou mook? no?</br>  <br>Rin probably secretly hates Haru for being better and will finally snap once Haru wins gold at the olympics and eat him on live television.</br>  <br> Those were official? <br>Yes? That's the concept art for their scales, I don't know how you missed this.</br></br>  <br>August 1st, Nagisa's birthday.</br>  <br><br>Free unrelated news, just ignore me. Nagisa's will cheer me up regardless of what comes.</br></br>  <br>I know that, but I'm not sure what he's wary of. Everyone loves Nagisa here.</br>  <br>Oh okay, great blog then, where do I subscribe?</br>  <br>Rin was pretty peculiar as a child. That part where he basically turns into Hulk made me laugh though because it's definitely something a boy his age would dream about.<br><br> Rin: God damnit! <br> Rin braces himself and bites Haruka’s neck. <br> Haruka: Gah…! <br> For a moment, Haruka’s expression is strained while Rin drinks his blood. <br> Rin: —! <br> The next moment, Rin’s muscles explode out of his shirt. <br> Rin: WOAHHHHHHH!!!!!! <br> *BOOM* <br> Rin grabs the iron bars. Because he drank the half fish man’s blood, his muscles suddenly got a huge powerup. He yanks the bars! <br> The gangsters are still approaching and look at Rin breaking open the bars. Rin looks at them and emerges from the warped hole he made in the cell’s iron bars. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> wary <br>Anxious also means excited about/can't wait for something, Anon.</br></br>  <br>I'm anxiously awaiting those SouRin scales.

They're basically polar opposites.</br>  <br>A Sounagi mook would be so much fun. They could be secret agents working on infiltrating Kisumi's evil organization, or bodyguards on a mission to protect Gou from a weird ass stalker thief, or just a compassionate neighborhood cop trying to comfort a broken and lonely astronaut who lost his best friend that never came back from a space mission years ago. The possibilities are endless.</br>  <br> Nagisa pairings <br> being popular <br>Anon, I...</br></br></br>  <br>I said this as someone who never cared for Nagiei or any other Nagisa pairings for that matter, I'm sure Nagisafags who are dubious about Rei would have latched onto it.</br>  Preview for Flower Afternoon's illustration. Seems like they are going to be fairies.<br><br>Fairies.</br></br>  <br>I can't imagine how Sousuke's gonna pull off that look, Rin's gonna look amazing though.</br>  <br>The Frees are finally becoming what we all knew they were since the first episode.</br>  <br>Rest of merch looks okay.

I remember it came out around the same time as the SouRin mook.</br>  <br> There's a shark in the pool. If anything, it's implying a massacre. <br>Yes, but it's a naked massacre.</br></br>  <br><br>Could be. I don't really remember when it came out, just that it was old.<br><br><br>Touche.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe Nagisa will be a fairy, Haru a water spirit, Rei some kind of nymph, Ai a goblin, etc.</br>  AniKuji, shota chibi.<br><br>I was personally expecting a greater shota influx due to the movie but (understandably) most fujoshi prefer teenage frees.</br></br>  <br>That's the only way I can see them pulling off Sosuke in the picture.<br>There's a chance they'll ignore him, I guess. But he was in all the others, as gay as they seemed, so it would be weird not to have him here too.</br></br>  <br>Someone suggested it was just Halloween costumes, but it seems early for that.</br>  <br>They'll definitely all be there.<br>Sousuke and Makoto could be adventurers, like normal humans who got lost in a forest filled with creatures. And Rin could be the princess they just rescued.</br></br>  <br> And Rin could be the princess <br>Please</br></br>  <br>Yeah. Flower Afternoon is releasing on August. Even if it's late August, there's still two whole months until Halloween.</br>  <br>Nagisa doesn't seem very forest-like. Maybe it's like an amusement park? And he seems to have someone else wearing the same behind (there's an orange shirt but the stripes don't match, and neither does the green vest). Also, he seems to be holding something, like a bag or pillow.</br>  <br>Yeah I just realized that too. But the shota Halloween artwork didn't make much sense either so who knows.<br>I thought maybe he was sitting at a table which is covered with a white drape, sitting (which is why you can see his legs, in purple pants). It seems a bit like a tea party in a meadow or something.<br>Also maybe the wings are just part of his fab outfits and all the other guys are dressed normally, and staring at him like "what the fuck is this disaster".</br></br></br>  Since we're having a live thread, might as well dump these here for those who have missed them. Bigger scans of those clear files that came together with High Speed movie tickets.  I'm still mad about the bland Alice in Wonderland official art we got.  <br>Based, I was looking for these in hq.</br>            <br>Also two pages from the HaruRin mook which weren't posted before. Nothing very interesting, as you can see, just a selection of scenes for each character.</br>    <br>I don't know if adding Sousuke's hearteyes was really necessary.</br>  <br>This is some weird shit.</br>   142 posts <br> 22 posters <br>Sasuga Free thread</br></br>  <br>I guess it can't be helped since about 80% of Rin's screentime in S2 was with Sousuke. They could have used some scenes from episode 12 but maybe those were used on the staff interview pages or something, I don't know.</br>  Mamo confirmed being in the HS2 movie. So we'll definitely be seeing Rin in some capacity.   Utsumi: But [Haruka] would have to study as well, so he's probably really annoyed as he's doing it. Plus he doesn't have anyone to rely on anymore (haha). <br> Nishiya: Someone to rely on? Doesn't he meet with Makoto fairly frequently? <br> Utsumi: I don't really know about that. Personally...well, while I'd like to share my personal thoughts, I think I'll leave it up to everyone's imaginations! <br><br>MakoHaru BTFO</br></br></br></br>  <br>Where is this info from? But this is nothing surprising, really, we already knew they would put him there in some form, at least in flashbacks or something.</br>  <br>The mook. Mamo mentions working on it.</br>  <br> RinHaru finally became canon <br>Does this mean SouMako is finally canon too?</br></br>   "I believe that [Haruka and Rin] form the core axis of ‘Free!’s story, and I have such deep emotional attachments to them that, if I wanted to, I could talk about them for ages." <br> - Utsumi Hiroko, staff interview in HaruRin mook </br>  <br><br>Baby's first wet dream?</br></br>  <br> trusting fencer's biased translation </br>  <br><br>Snippets only? When will fujoa translate the full interview?</br></br>  <br> Utsumi: Well…I would not say that Haruka and Rin are halves of each other. If anything, I think that Makoto would be the other half of Haruka. As for Rin, it’s clear that the person who understands him the most is Sousuke, and HighSpeed has iterated time and again that Sousuke is Rin’s other self. For Haruka and Rin, although they definitely complement each other, if it wasn’t for the common interest of swimming that they both have, they probably would not have become friends because of their opposite personalities. </br>  <br>Stay mad Makoharufag</br>  <br>No idea, apparently fencer's not doing it. Maybe some other fujo will.</br>  <br> Yoneda  <br>At the end of s2, tho they chose their paths, they were still together<br> Nishiya <br> This time, they had their first fight in s2, but in the end they properly made up and were able to move forward. I think from now on they'll be able to keep their relationship always the same. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you seriously telling me even Fencer isn't doing the full thing?</br>  <br> slidufhsldiufs I am so behind on things to post/translate/write that I don’t think I’ll have time to do the ENTIRE interviews, but I’m posting fun bits as I read! <br>Nope.</br></br>  <br> not even fencer gives a shit anymore </br>  <br>What a useless piece of shit.</br>  <br> apparently fencer's not doing it <br><br>So she only translated two snippets out of the entire interview? Interesting.</br></br></br>  <br>How sad, only two parts were fun to her.</br>   REGARDING WHERE THEY WOULD GO ON A TRIP WITH HARUKA AND RIN <br><br>Mamo: Then why not just go to Australia, in that case? Then, Rin and Haruka would sleep in the same bed, and I and Nobunaga-kun would sleep in the same bed.<br>Zakki: Ah, I get it--recreating that scene [from S2E12]. (haha)<br>Mamo: Yeah, like, 'There's only two beds!!' (haha) I wanna hit up all the [Free!] holy sites too. Let's go to that hotel that they stayed at.<br>Zakki: Let's go! To the same room from the anime!<br>Mamo: But that room only had one bed, huh. Uwaaah, four people in one bed? No way~!<br>Zakki: Sleeping back-to-back wouldn't even be possible then...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nah, there's more, I just didn't post it yet. That MakoHaru bit threw me off too much.<br><br> "We didn’t use it in the episode, but we also went to an aquarium in Australia. There was some suggestion that maybe Rin could take Haruka there to help him feel at ease. " <br> - Yoneda, HaruRin mook staff interview <br><br> "[In the final scene of the series], Rin as usual is eager for a race, but Haruka smiles when he looks at Rin. All we really see is that, but I believe that’s a shot that illustrates their new relationship as they walk down the same path of professional swimming together. " <br> - Utsumi Hiroko, staff interview in HaruRin mook <br><br> Mamo: So the bed scene, then? <br> Zakki: If you're going to talk about it, call it the 'scene where they talk while in bed'! (haha) <br> Mamo: Hey, it's not incorrect, is it? They're two people, sleeping in one bed together, after all. <br><br> "[Haruka and Rin] just feel like the ‘destined pair’ for one another." <br> - Miyano Mamoru, cast interview in HaruRin mook. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Makoto and Haru: "This sort of distance where they can see each other on occasion really suits them." </br></br></br>  <br> "[In the final scene of the series], Rin as usual is eager for a race, but Haruka smiles when he looks at Rin. All we really see is that, but I believe that’s a shot that illustrates their new relationship as they walk down the same path of professional swimming together. " <br> - Utsumi Hiroko, staff interview in HaruRin mook <br>As usual nothing Utsumi says makes sense. What a shitty director.</br></br></br>  <br>Any more besides those? These were spoiled before.</br>  <br>This romanchikku sakura is cute and shit, but I am disappoint. I wanted it to be as ridiculous as the other -<br><br> *SLAM* <br> The gangster punches Rin in the face. <br><br>Kyoani finds a way.jpg</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Happy birthday Nagislut  <br>Don't think so, maybe some other fujo translated something.</br>  Happy birthday best boy!  <br><br><br><br>So basically Utsumi says different things depending on which shippers they're trying to appeal to. Sasuga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's really little considering the length of the interview.</br>  <br>You only figured that out now?</br>  <br>Why can't Utsumi kill herself?</br>  <br>Nah, it's just funny seeing those interview quotes next to each other and how transparent Utsumi is.</br>  <br>There isn't any contradiction in her words. By saying to use their imagination, she didn't say anything to go against her previous words.</br>  Happy Birthday, Nagisa! I will love you forever and ever.  <br> So basically Utsumi says different things depending on which doujins she fapped to that morning. <br>ftfy<br>Utsumi a 2D slut who cheats on her husbando</br></br></br>  <br>I think that the rediscovery book fujo who was linked to earlier might translate something. I think she likes Haru and Rin but I don't know for sure.</br>    <br>Makoto gets to be  free  from being Haru's nanny for the rest of his life and has probably moved on to dicking him down whenever they meet thank you Utsumi.</br>  <br>Because she's smart enough to know that pandering to both sides means more money for KyoAni and she's probably laughing to herself all day every day</br>  <br>Slut.</br>  <br> implying <br>He still has to pick up Haru from his bathtub every day so Haru doesn't drown himself.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Thanks anon, I did actually missed them. What's with the line they all have, though? Part of the clear file or shit scan?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's understandable that she didn't want to talk about Makoharu in a mook about another pairing. It would be different if she said something contradictory.</br>  <br>Well, technically not. It's like that one time when she said that Haru and Rin would spend their days globetrotting the world together, and then a few days later another interview came out where she said they would only see each other at competitions and otherwise cheer each other on from their respective abodes (or something along those lines). Technically she didn't contradict herself because while Haru and Rin are both pursuing professional swimming, that doesn't mean they will be together all the time, but there is a clear difference in wording. Obviously HaruRin fujos latched onto the first quote while MakoHaru fujos prefer the second one.</br>  <br>Today is raining here. And Makoto's so pretty in this picture. I love him so much.</br>  <br>It's normal for a masochist who likes dick in his mouth.</br>  <br> It's like that one time when she said that Haru and Rin would spend their days globetrotting the world together <br>She didn't say that, it was something in a magazine. <br> she said they would only see each other at competitions and otherwise cheer each other on from their respective abodes <br>Now this she did say.</br></br></br></br>   all this MakoHaru vs HaruRin shitflinging <br>W-what if I like SouRin?</br>  <br>Just a shit scan but those are the biggest versions I could find. There are also smaller versions without the lines, if you're interested I could look for them for you.</br>  <br>Suicide is the only option.</br>  <br>Then you have good taste.</br>  <br>She actually didn't say the globetrotting thing, it was from the magazine. Considering how much she had been pandering to the MakoHaru fujos in previous interviews, it really confused me that she would even imply they would grow apart from each other but I guess it makes sense since it's in the HaruRin mook.</br>  <br><br><br>Well, they did mentioned in the event that everyone would be in it so it's not surprising at all. But they sure are taking their time filling the Cast section in the official site. Tatsuhisa appeared recently, it was only Shimazaki since the announcement of the movie.<br>http://movie-highspeed.com/cast-sta<wbr>ff/</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>You aren't even on Utsumi's mind enough for her to mention Sousuke in the interview.</br>  <br>You can be the middle man in a MakoHaru and HaruRin sandwich.</br>  <br>Who is this Sousuke person</br>  <br> it really confused me that she would even imply they would grow apart from each other <br><br>She didn't have the guts so she cop out by saying to use their imagination.</br></br></br>  <br>We talk about SouRin in 90% of the threads, where have you been?</br>  New Onepunch Man teaser<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Qea<wbr>FvbUi7mU</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Well this actually looks good.  <br> those sloppy effects <br> shitty coloring <br> CG backgrounds <br><br>Yeah, not having much hopes for this one.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>wow this is amazing</br>  It looks amazing.   mosquito girl is white <br>Fucking dropped.<br><br> I liked it. </br></br></br>  <br>Looks better than the first PV did.

Like she's in a deep darkness, like it'd make you go "Huh? What's up with this girl?". She might or might not going to get into a dangerous situation, and then when she's saved, her smile might or might not make you go "Huh? Is that okay? Huh?", or something like that. <br> Miku will definitely won't fall into darkness, she's just sincerely thinking about Hibiki. That said, she's gonna call out her hidden side and fool around a little bit. <br>Calling it now, Hibiki is going to die or go into magic coma and Miku is going to go to the dark side or do some other fucked up thing to get Hibiki back.</br></br></br>          <br><br>Why didn't they kiss</br></br>  Miku Miku Miku  <br><br> Low resolution piss poor quality facebook images <br>Stop that.</br></br></br>  <br>IS IT FRIDAY ALREADY?<br><br>HOLY SHIT.</br></br></br>  <br>I do not know me too I want</br>  <br>I wonder if her gear is actually just dormant inside her now.

Where am I? That concert was a blast, we must go together next time. I'm starting to like those Zwei Wing girls!     <br><br>This kills the Miku</br></br>  How will the thread react if Garie is first to kill? since she seems very famous in /a/ so far(unless i get it wrong)  <br>I'm still upset this exists.</br>  <br> Garie is first to kill <br>Since this is /a/ I'm not sure if you mean first to kill someone or first to die.</br></br>  <br><br>The picture or the mousepad?</br></br>  <br>I doubt we'll be seeing the Shen Shou Jing again. In fact I hope we don't. Mikugear was awesome and I don't dislike the idea of more Miku singing scary love songs while blowing shit up with lasers, but I'm with Kaneko on this one, Miku was not made to be a permanent gear. It's better to have it as that one time thing that was awesome.</br>  Is it Friday yet?  <br>Mousepad.</br>  <br>I mean first to die</br>  <br>On one hand I like Gary, she's cool.<br><br>On the other hand, Gariefags are starting to get annoying so I wouldn't mind seeing some tears.</br></br></br>    <br><br>Eh, fair enough.<br><br>Would it have been better or worse if it had been one of the other Symphogears, though?<br><br><br><br>You're fooling yourself<br><br>They Gary-fags would rage and cry, yes, but then they'd all just become Micah-fags<br><br>Do you really want that instead?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop it I'm trying to forget I ever read that.</br>  Is it airing at 3:10 like normal or is it delayed again?    <br><br><br>Could be worse<br><br>Imagine if Tsubasa walked in and Hibiki started fangirling over her and  asking if she could get Kanade's autograph </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>STOP</br>  Who DMJii here?

She seems well liked by everyone and if you're surrounded by flowers you will want to sniff and/or pluck them all.</br>   Chris was fine with Kirika and Shirabe PDA <br> the moment Hibiki and Miku started she panicked and shut it down </br>  <br>Because no one cares about DMJii, duh</br>  <br> that banding </br>  <br>DMJii are cute little girls holding hands.<br><br>Miku and Hibiki exhibit degenerate lesbian behavior. Chris has spent enough time around them to know exactly how gay they can get.</br></br></br>     No one posting best girl Chris   <br>You aren't supposed to hold hands in public until you're married.</br>  Friendly reminder that Miku saw Chris naked first before anyone else  Besides dozen of older men and probably women too  when she nursed her back to health.  <br>Hibiki will fall into a magic coma and Miku will work for some white-haired evil shota to bring her back even if it means fighting her friends.<br><br> Rewatching Mai Otome felt good. It was actually better than I remembered. </br></br></br>    <br>Or she starts wearing Miko clothes and tries to summon a mecha from the moon named after a legendary japanese sword together with Ogawa who is actually an Orochi.</br>  <br>She's so crosseyed.</br>  <br>I want to fuck Chris silly</br>  <br>Why are you forgetting Fine?</br>    <br>Isn't it fine to forget about Finé, she was more of a pimp to Chris. Not a potential yuri mating partner.</br>  So non-meme subs never?  <br>An anon mentioned in the last thread that H&amp;D's main... translator? Something, someone important to H&amp;D subs at least, is on vacation atm<br><br>no idea if it's true, but it seems plausible</br></br></br>  <br><br>Which one is BB?</br></br>  <br>While I think that wanting to do that shows that you're still alive because every breathing male would do that I still have to tell you that she already is silly. And crazy.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, Zoid is at Wonfes, so ep 4 is delayed.</br></br>  <br>I want to shove my dick between Hibiki's thighs.</br>  Is it Friday yet?  <br>12 hours and about 10 more minutes anon.</br>  <br>yes<br><br>now go back to sleep kirika, it's past your bedtime</br></br></br>  <br><br>I didn't care for Kiri last season but Damn has she gotten a lot better</br></br>  <br><br>Death</br></br>   Episode 5 <br>Is it going to happen again?</br>  <br>She was already a sexy little piece of work last season.</br>  Best pair:  Kirika's stripey socks     12 hours guys  No delay this week?    <br><br>Thumbnail looks like she had four arms.</br></br>  <br><br>She was pretty much Hibiki with different hair. I blame my recent attraction on the flood of good fan art and a delicious transformation sequence, things she lacked last season.</br></br>  <br>Garie and Micha have a lot of fan art together even though they were shown later than Phara and Lieur.</br>  <br>Because the latter are pretty lame.</br>  <br><br>They still have time to redeem themselves, but I doubt they can. Micha and Garie are Team Fun, Leiur and Phara are Team Serious, so it's obvious who's better.</br></br>  <br>Smug onee-chan and loli imouto make a great pair</br>  <br><br>Phara is fun in a way.</br></br>    <br>Why?</br>  So I just finished rewatching S1 for the first time since G aired. It literally brought me to tears three different times, and this moment caused me to "Fuck Yeah" hard enough to make my neighbors dog start barking.<br><br>We really don't deserve something this fantastic. How can one anime be so completely BASED?<br><br>Also, dat Aoi scream.</br></br></br></br>  <br>wont you drink Kirika's period blood every morning like Shirabe does? If you truly love her then you would do it too.</br>  That attack directly impacted Gungnir, shattering it and sending a shard into Hibiki's heart again. This time a shard of Micha's sword crystal thing also pierced her heart, so she's a Human/Relic/Alchemy hybrid.<br>Make it happen.</br>    <br>But Micha is my waifu</br>  <br> Less than 24 hours to go <br>My happiness is completely charged!</br></br>  Finally started season 3 i have 3 more episodes. Should i just marathon them before the new ep comes out?  <br>Hopefully they don't become too evil. I like them but I won't if they kill anyone other than nameless people.</br>  <br>Lieur has a megadeus that she can apparently materialize at will, she's anything but lame.</br>  <br>Hibiki will get up and go berserk, and rather than be concerned, Miku will smile and tell Hibiki to just murder the dolls.</br>  <br>Do it! Then you can livewatch with us tomorrow and join in on the discussion. Also, you'll love where this season is going. Definitely go for it!</br>  <br> Hopefully they don't become too evil. <br>Garie massacred a shit ton of people. She's beyond redeemable.</br></br>  <br>Leiur vs Chris<br>Phara vs Sword<br>Micha vs DMJii<br>Garie vs Maria<br>Bikki vs Carol<br><br>What would you do if it's Leiur's giant vs  motherfuckin' Genjurou  in a ship throwing contest  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> i <br><br><br>Perfection doesn't need to be redeemed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>your S1 character song &gt; the later ones</br>  <br>Rainbow Flower &gt; all.</br>  <br>Rainbow Flower wasn't in season 1, doofus.</br>  <br> Zenbu &gt; Rainbow Flower &gt; * <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br>I'd be cute about it, catch it in a glass and drop in a celery stick.

You have been fighting these enemies for a long time now, if what you say is true, and my alca-noise are only as strong as regular noise, why is your symphogear destroyed now?"<br>The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped her chalk and CD copy of Godfather Love Theme. She stormed out of the room crying those Idol-Hero crocodile tears. The same tears Idols cry for the “victims” (who even today still participate in witch hunts) when they jealously try to claw justly earned revenge away from the miracle killers. <br>There is no doubt that at this point our professor, Tsubasa, wished she had never lost to the alca-noise and become more than swordless sentinel who can only boast about Hibike’s strength. She wished so much that she had some kind of weapon to use, but she herself had lost it in her carelessness. The students applauded and all accepted the evilness of miracles and offered their memories to fuel Micha. An eagle named "Garie" flew into the room and kissed Micha in front of everybody.

But each can be broken into substances with different properties. For example, two forms of combustible "airs" with varying properties, ("respirable airs" called oxygene and hydrogene), can be extracted from distilled water by process of heating and charcoal filtration. When these airs are combined in a hermetic chamber and heated, they produce water vapor. Alchemy would claim that this is a process of air and water transmutation, yet cannot explain why both substances are required to transmute into water. The simpler, more complete explanation is that water is composed of the two other substances.

Despite this, I'm completely capable of enjoying harem series and shounenshit. "Socially dense person that is kind and forgiving despite having more unintentional charisma than wisdom" is an archetype for me, rather than a tool. An archetype that I can appreciate as much as any standard ojou, tsundere, or genki girl. I'd prefer it if they got a bit more depth, just to liven things up, but I understand how unlikely it is for this to happen beyond basic lateral shifts to reflect on harem members' personalities. Does this make sense? Are any other anons like this?</br></br>  <br>Self-insert is just an easy way to say "bland enough so that the personality doesn't affect muh waifus"</br>  <br>this<br><br> there are people who think self-inserting in an actual thing </br></br></br>  Its just people who don't want to live their own life so they place themselves into anime characters.<br>Personality is irrelevant.</br>  You have to cum at the same time as MC cums. Wait, that's self-insert in eroge. I have no idea, OP.  People don't actually put their lives into anime characters. They just say they do but that's not actually possible.<br><br>What they are really saying is not in regards to themselves but to the character. The character is bland enough so that he doesn't get in the way of the girls, what that kind of person really cares about. <br><br>It's a way to deflect from the idea that the show they are talking about is actually shit.</br></br></br></br>  I never got self-insertion either.<br><br>Or maybe I already do, but I don't know it yet.<br><br>But at the end of the day, that doesn't really matter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why not just say bland character then?</br>  If you can identify with the main character because of a lack of personal identity, you're off to a good start. Also there are a lot of loser protagonists out there with exaggerated problems, so it helps if you think your personal problems are much larger than they are. Then fuck all things socially tolerable and downright imitate that character in real life as much as possible.<br><br>Oh, whoops, that's how to be chuuni.</br></br>  <br> If you can identify with the main character because of a lack of personal identity, <br>How is that possible?</br></br>  <br><br>This. Self-inserts are the blandest possible shit so as to make it possible for otaku to have delusions of the girls falling for him. It's clearly possible, just look at that bland piece of shit swimming in pussy by being nice guy!<br><br>The moment you give harem protags personality you're also defining what the girls like and thus excluding the waifufags.</br></br></br></br>  <br> you might be gay if you have a penis because gay people have penis <br>got it thanks fam</br></br>  <br>You do. Pretty sure "self-insertion" is the same as just rooting for good things to happen to the main character. Even normal people self-insert without realizing it, kind of like how many rooted for good things to happen to Walter White, "self-insertion" is experiencing the emotions of the character whose perspective is being shown in the show. I think so, anyway.</br>  <br>In other words, putting your self in other shoes.<br><br>I don't think that's supposed to be bad.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't either, but newfags usually think it's some sort of alien concept than involves some ridiculous pretense of being the MC that only nerds do, but self-insertion is everywhere. People need to understand this, harems are no different from Transformers.</br>  <br><br><br>Its a more extreme version of feeling empathetic for a character.<br>You stop feeling for a character at some point and take attacks on that character (whether it be in RL or in the show) as a personal attack.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's called different things depending on the character.<br><br> bland or loser <br>Self-insertion.<br><br> ideal <br>Gary stu.<br><br> realistic <br>Empathy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I kinda wish I could, It would make watching some shit so much easier.  I think, and this is just a personal opinion you can discard, self-inserting is something that only a loser could and would do.<br>I mean, you can relate to some characters (even females MC) because X or Y. But self-inserting, well, there might be people who never got anything and by doing so, they feel like there's still a light of hope for them.<br>Regardless, like the OP says, I've always seen myself like a simply observer.<br>Also, I don't think self-insert it's the same as 'putting yourself in other shoes' like this Anon  thinks. That's called 'empathy', and is used to understand other people's feelings and act in a condescending way, while self-insert it's more like feeling you're that guy in the show.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, I have never felt like that.</br>  <br>I do self insert when I play RPG or visual novels/eroge with multiple choices.<br><br>I would ask myself what I would do in that situation and the characters change with those choices I make.</br></br></br>  <br>You're a wise man, OP.<br>I also never considering myself to self-insert to a MC of a show.<br>I'm just an audience, an observer.<br>Also, I really hate when people throwing "self-insert" easily to every male protagonist of anime.</br></br></br></br>  This bitch got BTFO<br><br>And finally the orgy chapter, I was wondering when I would get to see a bunch of mindless high schoolers trying to get on teen pregnancy or raped then on teen pregnancy. And it's so realistic too, they don't have feelings or anything! Just like real life.</br></br>  F  This is still going on? Who is brown girl and why is rape still the common currency of this series?  <br>SHe is not a virgin anymore</br>  I think I stopped reading at the chapter where ole dude kamen rider was bout to get his face smashed by this girl.<br>Then MC went full beast mode and started teleporting around shit.<br>I need to catch up.</br></br>  <br>It's getting even more ridickulous.</br>  <br>Dinoponera, OP broken ant who schools everyone.<br>Then LOL PARALYSIS which initiates rape time for mindless mob of schoolboys.</br></br>  So why is she wearing Ninja gauntlets?  <br>does she really get raped?<br>i saw the raws up to 64 and she never gets mentioned again</br></br>  <br>She probably got converted? Might see her later, idk.</br>  <br> paralyzed, can't move <br> thrown down next to the zombie orgy <br> zombie boys see da NEW WOMAN VIRGIN, move in closer <br> Brown girl says NOOOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo!!!!! <br>What do you think happens?</br></br></br></br></br>  Di mak-chan got raped? Shit I wanted her to stop being so autistic about how MC wasn't a war refugee and go back to her crazy ditz self.  <br>Read the chapter, she's DIO jr. as well?</br>  <br>Unless she froze time in between her NOOOOOO scream and penetration, she was def raped.</br>  <br>so another victim of the ol cockoach cockblock?</br>  <br>It got much, much more silly after that. There's a girl who was raped so much she developed a mind control STD.</br>  <br>Is that the president?</br>  So bully-chan was an evil assassin all along?  <br>The titty monster, yeah.</br>  This manga has been going for, what, almost 6 years now? How long has the deathmatch arc been going?  <br>I remember first starting to read this and thinking it was going to be about some bullied highschool girl doing underworld assassinations and criminal dealings.<br><br>God this shit is disappointing.</br></br></br>  <br>How can you be disappointed? <br>You can't exactly say that's not what's happening.<br>She even has a lesbian harem.</br></br></br>  <br>What's the point of a harem if there's no fucking?</br>  <br>She's got Goki and that's about it. Everyone else is either not interested, a two-faced traitor, or just plain dead.</br>  <br>Nah, she also has black haired bully girl who lives with her, big boobed girl, and probably soon to be diponera. They did kiss after all, yes she did try to kill her but what did you expect? That bitch is crazy in love.</br>  <br>There is rape in these series?</br>  <br>A bit.<br><br><br>Its only terrible because this arc has lasted way too fucking long</br></br></br></br>  <br> black haired bully girl who lives with her <br>First thought dead but then turned out to be an assassin.<br> big boobed girl <br>Dead.<br> diponera <br>Maybe in a year or two if the pacing stays like this.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the manga's been stuck on the same day for 4 years <br>Wow.</br></br>  <br>They're all in love with her.<br>Look deep in your heart, you know it to be true.</br></br>  <br>The first one's got a sniper trained on Alice's head, the second one tried to rape Alice before being strangulated to death, and the third one impaled Alice before calling her a freak and legging it.<br><br>Only Goki is love.</br></br></br>  <br>1 &gt;So madly in love if she can't have her no one can<br>2 &gt; Raping out of love<br>3 &gt; She was her first kiss, they share a true bond no one can break.</br></br></br>  <br> Only Goki is love. <br>True.</br></br>  Is ex-bully the boss?  <br>Yes, she wants alice's virginity as a prize.</br>  I've tried 4 times to get into this manga. Is it worth it for the gang rape scenes?  <br>You tell me.</br>  Uhm.  <br> oh boy </br>  How far do we have raws up to?  <br><br>If only Kamen Rider was there, he'd set things right.</br></br>  <br>67, I think.<br><br><br>Too bad he's still passed out somewhere.</br></br></br></br>  <br>W-woah now, girls can't do things like that to each other!</br>  <br>The titty monster can.</br>    <br>They sure do</br>  <br>gives another meaning to the old phrase "Come into my parlour" that's for sure.</br>      <br> too lewd </br>  <br> tongue <br><br>That poor girl is losing her soul, and the cyclops is just fucking watching.</br></br></br>  <br>TRANSLATION WHEN!?</br>  <br>It's okay, turns out she covered her lips with a thin film so she wouldn't be affected by the mind control STD.</br>  <br>Not anytime soon. Apparently the translator is caring for his sickly mother and is having a hard time making ends meet. That's what he said, anyway.</br>  <br>There's almost a whole volume before we get to this part, which is the second-last chapter available.</br>  <br> 2 &gt; Raping out of love <br>She wanted to rape Alice because Alice wasn't feeling miserable enough about life.</br></br>  <br> Kamen Rider <br> fixing anything <br>When has he ever?</br></br></br>  <br>She wanted to share the despair with her lover. Sharing is caring.</br>  <br>How many fucking battles are there going to be in this arc? Are we going to be sitting around in 2020 watching as Horseshoe Crab shows up to fight off Windscorpion, or what?</br>  <br>He stopped the first guy at the pool and let Alice escape.</br>  <br>Can it even be called just an arc at this point? I mean, it makes up the majority of all chapters in the manga, and by quite a large margin. Everything else might as well be thought of as prologue for the school rumble.</br>  <br>I think by 2025 daddy long legs (Alice's true father) will show up to defeat cock roach (Alice's one true love) and eventually she will have to kill her real father and become head of the organization herself only to create a nice happy place for lesbian rapists, murderers, assassins, and serial killer ninja bugs can live in peace.</br>   in a couple of chapters beetle girl is gonna get forgotten too <br><br>whyyyyy</br></br>  <br>I think she's probably going to be a part of the harem now.</br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>It seems Miss Forehead is the boss.</br>  <br>Wait, wasn't big boobs glasses-chan the actual secret boss queen?</br>  <br>I'm too used to the plot device in this manga but this shit is the deepest that the author managed to pull from his ass so far.</br>  <br>She was the real queen, but was still following orders from hornet. Yoriko is behind them all.</br>  <br>I thought she died. What happened?</br>  <br>I'm hoping for Yoriko to mean no harm to Alice. That would be an actual twist.</br>  <br>She's actually an assassin. I don't know what the fuck is happening anymore, this shit is out of hand.</br>  <br>She died.<br>But then she lived!<br><br>She's somehow resistant to poison, probably.</br></br></br></br>  To think she kept calling Goki untrustworthy...  So the past like 30 chapters have all taken place in the span of less than 6 hours or so, right?  <br>So she's the man behind the man behind the man behind the man, except the second and third men were actually in front of the fourth man the whole time? What the fuck?</br>  <br>This nonsense begins in chapter 19.<br>67-19=48</br></br>  <br><br>What the hell is the editor of this manga doing? <br><br>This is some Namek shit</br></br></br></br>  <br>He probably thinks it's better than trying to force an actual plot on the guy.</br>  <br>Really? It's more bullshit than mind control pussy and sensing vibrations in the outside air while in an underground bunker?</br>  <br>She came back. That's about it. She also has a sniper friend who blew Hornet Papa's brains out in front of Alice. Shit's going places.</br>  I dropped this the first time rape started happening. Shit's crazy yo  <br>You mean you dropped it from chapter 1?</br>  Come to think of it, the cast of Killing Bites probably won't get off that fight island for a LONG time either.  <br>Funny, I actually forgot when this happened. Was it ch1?</br>  <br>Yes, the manga practically starts with that.</br>  I only read until chapter 10 or so.<br>I heard the MC got raped. Is this true? If it is true, did she like it? </br>  <br>Nah. She came close to it a million times but no.</br>  <br>Ah, no. There was one time the ant queen fantasized about getting Alice mind broken in a rape dungeon. People saw that one panel before the full raw came out and thought it was for real.</br>  <br> why is rape still the common currency of this series? <br>If you don't have police, then many people will simply do whatever they want. That's human nature. Some people will still behave nicely, but the bad people will overrun those and take over.<br><br>Besides, when are teenagers more civilized than adults if they had impunity to do whatever they wanted? You can only expect the angst and anger to overflow and result in the teens humiliating, beating, and stepping on those they don't like.<br><br>This story is great for teens that want self insert revenge fantasy about beating up everyone else.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is she Satomi Arai's next character portrayal?  <br>So you dropped it right before kahen rider sentenced Goki to justice rape<br><br>which goes against his ideals but the hypocrisy isn't adressed at all because rape rape rape</br></br></br>  <br><br>F</br></br>  <br>more like she was possessed by the spirit real boss, or there's some syringe that transferred the real boss's conscious into other people.</br>  <br>I dropped this shit when goki turned into yamcha.</br>  <br>Considering there was the brainwashing incident, I don't think I would be surprised if it turned out bully-chan was possessed or anything. She was kinda already given a butterfly motif back when they all went shopping, which could have been foreshadowing, but I'm quite convinced that the mangaka never plans further ahead than one or two chapters.</br>   Oh no, the ant queen can control other animals with her power <br> Alice gets her shit wrecked for one chapter <br> But there is an madagascar spider which only reproduces once a year that only eats queen ants <br> Alice fucks everyone up <br><br>I fucking love this manga.</br></br></br></br></br>  In a previous thread, an anon suggested the boss might be a Strepsiptera because of the wasp possession.  <br>When does magical girl Termite-chan show up, though?</br>  <br> when they all went shopping <br>When?</br></br>  <br> I'm quite convinced that the mangaka never plans further ahead than one or two chapters. <br><br>I wonder why beetle girl took so long to go meet Alice if the job was important to her as a last request from a friend.</br></br></br>   Mom finds my collection of cute girl anime (Madoka, K-ON, Girls und Panzer) and Shoujo Manga <br> Confronts me with Dad and asks if I'm gay <br> Won't believe me when I say I'm not <br>How did you explain to your parents that watching anime doesn't make you gay?</br></br></br>  <br>No, my mom's actually been dead for years just in case you're actually worried. I lied on the internet about something that never happened in order to make a joke about moe anime.</br>  Shouldn't they be more worried that you're a pedophile? <br><br>Maybe you should be caught masturbating more</br></br>  <br> It's not pedo at all and a lot of men like them. You're perfectly normal if you enjoy sexy women between 9 and 14. <br>Tell that to normalfaqs.</br></br>  <br>Why the hell wouldn't you accept it?<br>If you ever fuck up in the future, if they threaten to sack you just threaten to sue them for wanting to fire you because of your sexuality.<br>They already know you're gay, might as well exploit it.</br></br></br>  <br>Joey best girl.</br>  What do you think about this anime?  <br>Because if she cut her hair she'd be called a boy like a certain other Gurashi.</br>  <br>I don't want fangs anywhere near my dick</br>  <br> Not liking playful bite. <br>Dont be a faggot anon.</br></br>  <br>Kurumi is way more girlish like her, she even wants to be a bride and shlicks to her senpai at home.</br>  <br><br> fang in urethra <br>Oh baby.</br></br></br>  Episode 9: "The Passionate Sibling Bond of Saga"<br><br> Sigmund is out for revenge due to the death of his younger brother Siegfried. <br> However, Saga easily defeats Sigmund using great powers worthy of his reputation as the strongest Gold Saint. <br> His powers were great enough to even surprise Andreas. <br> As Saga tries to finish off Sigmund, a ray of light appears in front of Sigmund! <br> Meanwhile, an even battle between Aiolia and Frodi was being carried out in the Warrior Chamber. <br> Then, someone comes into this ferocious battle... <br> It's Lyfia!
