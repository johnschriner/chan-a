Is this just fantasy?</br></br>    awesome. you know if you'll be doing 71 tonight too yet?  It's time  <br>Just be happy he's doing 70 tonight.</br>  <br>Good evening sir</br>  <br>Maybe with a break between.</br>  <br> A break <br>It's going to be to the 24 hour store, ain't it?</br></br>  <br>I'd prefer if he did  69  ;) </br>  <br>Oh no, I am very happy. Just curious.<br><br><br>Aiight</br></br></br></br>  Welp.  <br>Maybe he's on a laptop or a tablet and he'll do it at the 24 hour store.</br>  In the last discussion thread some people were recommending patreon or paypal (and my neglected site already had a button for that) and I could EMS the magazines every week. Unfortunately this is expensive... ends up about $15 USD per chapter then. I would much rather find someone already scanning the mag and give them a few bucks.<br><br>Otherwise it seems the forseeable future will be 24-hour store raw sourcing.</br></br>  <br> the forseeable future will be 24-hour store raw sourcing. </br>  <br>So thats like $60 dollars a month or somthing? Am sure we can raise that easily.</br>  Finally i can see Mizuki's softness again.  <br>Fansubbing wouldn't have died if the community could manage $60 a month.<br><br>Also, if people start paying Aereus, they'll feel entitled to a speedy release.<br>I doubt he wants that additional pressure, we already shitpost about him enough as it is.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Given that this livetl probably has at least 50 unique visitors eah time, it would only cost about a dollar per month for patreon. That said, i doubt even a tenth would donate. Still patreon would be the better bet than paypal, because you would probably need to run monthly drives, which would get tedious.</br>  <br>Aereus stop being a faggot and do it, you don't trust in us? we can reach that easily without problem faggot.</br>  <br><br>You say that, but Crunchyroll is doing better than ever. Clearly the community *can* handle paying that much money, but for whatever reason, fansubbers never convinced enough folks to donate.</br></br>  Hey guys, what's going on this thread.  ( Becoming flustered from a kiss is magic. )<br>( Melting in their arms from a kiss is love. )<br><br>Boku Girl #70 - My Cinderella</br></br></br>  <br>Personally, I don't mind waiting until shit raws show up (as they will eventually). It may be less consistent, but it allows Aereus' work to be a gift rather than an expectation. The moment people pay money, the moment people start to really shitpost these threads when delays happen.</br>  <br> kiss <br> KISS <br> &gt;&gt;&gt;KISS </br></br></br>  <br>Anybody live in a big metro? I moved out of SF so I can't help you, but Japanese bookstores like Kinokuniya probably have the latest issues for reasonable prices. You could probably even call them up and have them deliver them via post if you didn't live too close.</br>  <br><br>The best part is when you realize the majority of those whining are those who did not pay.</br></br>  <br>MIZUKIIIIIIIIIII WWWWWHHHHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY<br><br>MY DICK JUST EXPLODE.</br></br></br>  fuck yes  <br>We have one here in Chicago, I would go to it more but it's in the far northside and am in the southside so it's a long ride with no el station near by. I tried to get the newest issue of Type Moon Ace but they sold out in japan and thus I couldn't get it.</br>  <br>You might be able to call them up and they could mail it to you pretty speedy for cheap or set up a subscription service.</br>  <br>I tried that but the magazine I wanted was sold out in japan and it seems they don't do a 2nd printing of magazines in japan. That what they told me at least, also shipping was kinda pricey too. It was like 5-6 dollars to ship across the city but am guessing it was shipping straight from japan.</br>  Wow! || The Princess!?<br>Suzushiro-kun is?<br><br>Ahahahaha! Everyone's so focused on Mizuki lately~<br>Once they found out about Mizuki being a girl, she drew even more attention.<br><br>And I hear you're going to be the Prince?<br>Yep. Everyone thought it would be fun to change it up a bit.<br>I bet that's because the boys were griping about Cinderella being chosen~<br><br>** What a mis-casting for Cinderella! How does Fujiwara-san feel about it...!? **</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's more that the distributors only carry the latest issue. So if you ask them close to/after the next issue hits stands, they probably can't get it anymore.<br><br>You could use a forwarding service like Solaris (150yen fee I think) to forward it from Amazon, but magazines are considered "addon items" so you need to order at least 2500yen worth before they will ship them.<br><br>Otherwise you could check out something like HMV which tends to have stocks of magazines for at least a few back issues.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh ok then I guess I'll check those out. Thanks</br>  <br> Prince Fujiwara <br> Cinderzuki <br> Mis-casting <br><br> How wrong can one sentence be?</br></br></br></br></br>  Hey, so about the Prince and Princess...<br>Are they gonna kiss?<br>(( SPURT ))<br><br>Wh-wh-why would you say that?!

He's really cool.<br>For sure. But he kinda had the wind taken out of his sails with Suzushiro-kun around.<br>With such a cutie nearby, I wonder why you never noticed him?

HP starved, nephy had her organs removed, Othinus hung herself.</br></br>  <br>Maybe this difference is caused by the networks not having the same structure ?</br>    <br>I like it.</br>  You guys at least all agree that NT9 was the best volume right?  <br>Pretty much is but I didn't like the end of it though, got really cringe worthy.</br>  <br>Misaki a shit.</br>  <br>Mikoto a shit.</br>  <br><br>Othinus a shit.</br></br>  <br>Olay Blueshake a shit</br>  <br>Frenda a shit.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Great thread people</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>This tbh.</br>  NYANG-NYANG A SLUT  <br> chinese vampire <br>Would Himegami be effective against her?<br>Not that it matters anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>I really like Akikawa Mie.</br>  <br> M-MUH LIQUID DIAMOND </br>  <br>Faggot please, it's<br> M-MUH PARENTS' BOND </br></br>   Mikotofags BTFO <br><br>Best novel.</br></br>  <br>I skim read whenever she comes up, i don't give a shit about her.</br>  <br>She's the true heroine of this volume.</br>  <br>I wish she had a character design.<br><br>Or did Haimura come up with one and we just have to wait for him to update his website?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think he did or we would have seen it in the spoiler images.</br>  <br>Faggot kamachi made by boy Fiamma get trashed so fuck this whole volume.</br>  <br>But he got trashed by Othinus, too in volume 8.</br>  <br>I'm fairly certain there's always some stuff he draws that doesn't make it into the actual volumes.</br>  <br>He went out doing some damage to Othinus. Here, the High Priest casually exploded him and continued his Tom &amp; Jerry routine with Touma and Biri.</br>  <br> liking Stiyl 2.0 </br>  <br>Alright you have a point. I also remember people saying Fiamma was dead because he hadn't shown up after unlike Ollerus.</br>  <br>Atleast he stabbed her though before that.</br>   misaka being slightly useful <br> some mentions of Misaki so she doesn't seem to be too easily forgotten like some other girls    coff itsuwa coff  <br> Aleister keeping everything in place from the shadows makes him look like he isn't just in full damage control against magic gods <br><br>only complaints are no othinus and no based kihara dog<br><br>  Kamachi you motherfucker give IB a power up already  </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why does things always go against him despite being broken as fuck?  <br>Dragons.</br>  <br>so far the dragon it's a teaser for the final reveal of IB's secrets<br><br>i'm talking more of stuff like the ability to pass/extend IB to other body parts temporarily <br><br>also there's forgotten stuff about the reference point of the world so IB could erase some layers of the world, and it was implied othinus used it to bring back Touma's world</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he got bullshited twice for being op<br> the he made overpowers him and takes over <br> accel can't redirect him because DM is bullshit and he can change the values on a whim <br> accel creates a way despite this even though he still can't into magic </br></br></br></br>   ‚ÄúOh, how heartbreaking!! Beauty is the standard among standards of an Iga woman, yet this was enough for you to lose your self-control? Fine then. I, Kuruwa, shall retrain you from square one starting today!!‚Äù <br><br> ‚ÄúPlease noooo! The seduction techniques of a legit kunoichi will only ensure I never trust a woman again!!‚Äù <br>So that's where Misaka's outfit in the dream came from.</br></br></br>  <br>Because the plot demands it.</br>  <br> oh shit my dad kind of got some weird shit and invoqued and angel <br> oh fuck some crazy dude from the catholic church started WW3 <br> oh man this crazy dude is even more powerful than god but loses because i'm weak as fuck <br> shit CJ this magic god can do anything but doesn't just kill me because reasons so i get to bullshit my way out and make her my doll sized waifu <br><br>fucking magic gods lose because magic gods are too powerful in this series, so go figure</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty great.</br>  <br>The plot armor of Accelerator is even more broken.<br>I mean seriously. Does alister turn the coffee he drinks into luck potions?</br></br>  It's alright I guess  Why does the Girl prostitute herself? Surely she must have been making good money from running with Kakine.  <br>Working as a mercenary for SCHOOL is just to make ends meet. Her true passion lies in pleasing old men.</br>  <br>The character was around volumes ago with illustrations and everything. You're almost as slow as Misaka.</br>  <br>Better than the previous two NT volumes. It's high time Misaak got major focus, and I'm liking what I see for her and what goes on in her interactions with Touma.</br>  <br>I didn't read the SS volumes.</br>  <br> Misaak  <br>You can't even spell her name right.</br></br>  Another Index fighter when? One's that not shit.  <br>?</br>  <br> Misaka will never ride a bike with you while holding tightly around your waist while running from a High Priest <br>Suffering.</br></br>  <br>Thank god. I'm not into violent electrocunts.</br>  It's bad. It needs more magic gods interactions and less Mikoto.  <br>Your loss.</br>  <br>Mikoto proving her cutest status with NT13.</br>  <br> cutest  <br><br>No. She wouldn't even enter into a top 10 of cutest Raildex girls.</br></br></br>  <br>Mikoto is number 1.</br>  <br>Not even cutest Misaka.</br>  <br> Mikoto is number 1. <br> number 1 <br> not mjolnir </br></br></br>  <br>Do vampires even actually appear throughout the entire series, excluding Himegami's flashback?</br>  <br>My opinion &gt; your opinion.<br><br><br>Mikoto at peak moe can be cuter.</br></br></br></br>  <br> not almighty Thor <br><br><br> peak moe <br><br>No such thing for her.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   butthurt morons still despise Mikoto because they want to fit in   <br> Most of the background characters are vampires hiding in plain view.</br>  <br>More like THK.</br>  <br> they aren't praising my waifu <br> that means they are despising her!  <br> that means they want fit in! <br><br>No wonder you Mikotofags are the worst fans.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that legit or are you just fucking with me?</br>  <br>Well it says in the novels outright that it was only an excuse to have the sisters distro'd.</br>  <br> I swear it on the name of St Germain.</br>  <br>It can't be helped. That comes with the territory for popular girls.</br>  <br>The amount of disguise is incredible.</br>  <br>Crowley already basically does whatever he wants. Why not just distro from the start with all 20k instead of waiting until half got killed?</br>  <br>That's a funny way of spelling Angelene.</br>  <br>Probably needed a cover.<br><br>20,000 clones sent out just because<br>vs<br>10,000 test subjects repurposed due to failed experiment</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know that the plot point is a bit weird, but my theory is that a certain amount of mental anguish or mindfucking is required to make the angels.

Seeing Mikoto getting BTFO is always great.</br>  <br><br>They really screwed up Shinobu's character design, didn't they?</br></br>  <br>Everyone was sad at how they didn't put in the fish eyes.

I'd assumed we'd have public LQ raws out by now, but it doesn't look like it, from as much as I've seen or heard.<br><br>I've ordered my magazine, and while I'm hoping it'll get to my place before Thursday, most likely it'll be delivered while I'm out of town, which means no HQ raws/live TL for a good week and a half, sadly.<br><br>However, once I get everything in, it should only take a day or two for the chapter itself to come out, so you don't have to worry about another three-month delay.<br><br>I shouldn't have any kind of delay for next month, though. Hooray!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I propose a water (or jelly) filled bladder in a daki shape. When shall we begin?  <br>Thanks for the update.</br>  <br>TF   where did you buy the magazine? actually I can only find expensive shit instead of the price when the adaptation was just a myth  </br>  <br>I used to import it from Amazon.jp + a forwarding company, but the forwarding company took so long to process things (2+ weeks?!) that I switched over to CD Japan not too long ago, and I've been really happy with their shipping times.<br><br>Usually I get the magazine in 3-4 days after I order. They've been really helpful when I fuck up and send it to the wrong place, too.</br></br></br>  Rachnee and Cerea are best girls  An ogre is blending into this thread, can you spot her?  <br>she's like an onion</br>  <br> Yes. <br><br> All girls are best girls though. </br></br></br>  <br>Nope <br><br>  mero a shit A SHIIIIITTTT <br><br>  sorry TF I know you self insert on her  </br></br></br></br></br>  Obviously Lala is best.  <br> Rachne and Cerea  and Suu  happen to be even better than the rest. <br><br>Hi-res when?</br></br></br>  <br><br>High tier: &gt;2 legs<br>Mid tier: 2 legs<br>Low tier: &lt;2 legs</br></br></br></br>  <br>/r ing mermaids are quick to recognize lewdness, i know you have it</br>  <br>Do not trust this poster.

Why not Illustrator? Unless you were going to do something with it you made that wayyy harder on yourself then you could have.</br>  <br>Forgivable. I think most people here would be guilty of that.</br>  <br>Thats a good problem to have.  Papi's not even in the first episode though </br>  <br>Because flash is 10x easier for me to use than illustrator. I've only used illustrator to ace my graphic design class in high school and never touched the program again. Then again I only use the line tool + free transform tool almost exclusively. Time consuming, sure, but terribly easy.</br>  <br><br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hDH<wbr>XFBP-9HQ</wbr>  [ ]<br>My heart.Truly the best way to Miia's heart is to feed her all the eggs  and be Darling. </br></br></br></br>  Oy.  <br>As long as you translate them in a speedy fashion instead of dragging your feet under the guise of 'quality' (because how much touch up do these pages really need?) <br><br>Good.</br></br></br>  <br>They do actually need a lot of touching up to look nice, but again, after our staff shuffling, it shouldn't take more than a few days to get it out this time! The biggest hold-up is with getting raws this month.<br><br>If there are any Japan/East Asia anons who can pick up the magazine and provide good quality 300dpi scans, we could probably get it out this week!</br></br></br>  Does Mero's mom pop up in the latest chapter? Does she look like this?  Lala needs more art in my opinion  <br>Fuck off.</br>  Hmm. Next event for the game was due 2 hours ago. Maybe they ran out of ideas for a bit.  <br>Yup.</br>  I need to fuck Rachnera  <br><br> Darlings birthday <br> The girls can't really leave the house alone to go birthday shopping for him, so they decide to make something on their own <br> Lala figures she'll try and make him something too <br> But she can't really think of anything <br> She finds an empty tucked away in a closet with a bow on top <br> Later, Lala stumbles up to darling without her head, holding the gift box <br> With a hole cut in it </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> she finds an empty gift box <br>I fucked up. I'm sorry, thread.</br></br>  <br>Oh jeez <br>It's too late for this</br></br>  <br> Darling's birthday <br><br>This needs to be an actual chapter</br></br></br>  <br>And the joke is that they are a day early, and do everything when it isn't his birthday.</br>  <br>yeeees, i made this specifically 'cause it seemed like no one could grasp when the anime airs, glad to see it going around</br>  <br>Fill us up, with jello goodness.</br>  <br>Just fuck a waterbed.</br>  Figures when???  Such a lewd head.  <br><br><br><br> We will never get to see Lala's Lalas <br> She will never have another issue dedicated to her <br> She is just a plot device now to keep Darling alive. <br>At least she's going to be the real winner in the end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> His birthday is the next day <br> The girls all forget about trying to get him real gifts and try to have sex with him as a "gift" instead <br> Darling wakes up one morning <br> Feels something at the foot of his bed <br> It's Lala's head and what appears to look like blood is covering his sheets <br> Whole scene is a reference to The Godfather <br> Darling briefly freaks out until he realizes it's Lala <br> She claims her body had wine but spilled it <br> She asks if he'd like help with his morning wood <br> He rolls her off the bed </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> all me <br>I post too much Lala.</br></br>  <br>BAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I could so see that.</br>  <br>I feel like Cerea needs to get wine splashed on her as well, if we're going for the Godfather pastiche.</br>  <br> Lala picks up her head and walks out <br> Cerea makes some kind of remark <br> Lala splashes the last of the wine on her head </br></br></br>  <br>Darling's birthday needs to be on the next full moon.</br>  Someone care to explain to me what the fuck the whole Lala thing? Is she a god of death or no? What was that "adolescent thing" about? I'm really confused.  <br>I bet she gives great  anal </br>  <br>Jello is for eating   out  </br>  <br>I want to  sniff her ass </br>  I really want Lala to turn into a voyeur type. All the other girls try to forcefully do it with Darling, but she likes to watch him as he showers, or while he sleeps.<br><br> They go to the hot springs again <br> Lala holds her head up so she can look over the wall dividing the men and women baths </br></br></br>  <br> Lala can give you a footjob while sucking your dick at the same time <br><br>Is Lala the true masterrace?</br></br></br>  <br> footjob </br>  <br><br> team <br><br>A team for what?<br>Stealth Infiltration? A SWAT Raid?<br><br>Whatever it is, probably Miia and Mero.<br>Not only my favorite girls (excluding maybe Rachnera), but they'd have both any type of Land or Water Terrain covered.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just an example. Imagine the possibilities.</br>  <br>Both at the same time sounds like it would be awkward to perform. Try to give a footjob and her head gets in the way, try to give a blowjob and the feet get in the way.<br><br>Here's a better idea<br> She can sit on your face and give you a blowjob at the same time </br></br></br></br>  <br>You can kiss her whilr pounding it from the back. <br>You can carry her head around in your backpack for mobile blowjobs.<br>Lala best.</br></br></br>  <br>how would she do that without kicking herself in the face</br>  <br>That's part of the fun, anon.</br>  <br> Lala "accidentally" drops her head over the wall <br> lands on darlings lap <br> extreme blushing </br></br></br>    <br> She can sit on your face and give you a blowjob at the same time <br>Any woman can do that, virgin.<br>69</br></br></br>  <br>I understand that. But face sitting isn't quite the same as 69.<br><br> You can get in much deeper with face sitting, I've found. </br></br></br>  <br>I don't even know what to tell you. You're so stupid I'm hurt.</br>  <br>One more reason I like tall girls, anon...</br>  Just watched the first episode. <br>Miia seems like...a bit of an airhead.</br>  <br>If the wall is low enough for that to work, Cerea or Miia can already do that with a lot less effort. Lala and Polt are only about 157/158.</br>  <br> &gt;tfw 193cm<br> tfw hard to find girls close being as tall as you </br> <br><br> Lala is 158cm <br>Jesus she's short.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, you don't understand. It's an angle and weight centre problem. Isn't facesitting if there's no sitting, you see?</br>  <br> short <br>She's packed.</br></br>  <br>There is an entire chapter on this dilemma in Prison School, you know.</br>  Mero &gt; Miia &gt; Suu &gt; Papi &gt; Ranchnee &gt; Cerea  Lala = Suu &gt; The rest  Polt is number wan  <br><br>Miia can hold you in an near-infinite number of positions.</br></br>  The very breast  <br><br> dat beautiful blonde mane <br><br>I approve.</br></br></br></br>  <br>watch the next one, fall in love with Papi</br>  <br>Hound I thought you were all about Tio. Did you jump ship again?</br>  <br>I'm on team Tall Girls.</br>  <br>So far it looks like Cerea &gt; Miia = Papi</br>  <br> tfw 6"5' <br>muh giant bro<br>I know your pain well, shit is awful.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd reply with a <br><br> horse pussy <br><br>edit, but nay I have none.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> horse pussy <br>That's the best part.</br></br>  <br>Mah nigga.</br>  Racing episode when?  <br><br>She's not an air-head.<br>She's just passionate.<br><br>You want an air-head, that's Papi.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I want to  go bowling with  Lala.</br>    Jojolion 45 photo raws:<br> http://tieba.baidu.com/p/390490144<wbr>1?fr=frs</wbr> <br><br>EoH to have no paid DLC/Microtransactions. Araki overseeing story:<br> http://blog.livedoor.jp/jyojyo_sok<wbr>u/archives/44815077.html</wbr> <br><br>http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So has anyone read Araki's pre-JoJo works (Magic Boy BT, Baoh, Gorgeous Irene)?<br><br>Are they any good?</br></br>  <br> So has anyone read Araki's pre-JoJo works (Magic Boy BT, Baoh, Gorgeous Irene)? <br>Yes<br> Are they any good? <br>No</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really, but at least they are very short.</br>  <br><br>Baoh and Irene are good you shitter. I've been following Guyver recently and man I wish I was reading Baoh again instead.</br></br>  Ok now can the guy who keeps saying he turned the capsule into a snake please shut the fuck up  Did jojo invented that purple menacing text?<br>I see it in every modern anime.</br>  Haven't started reading 8 yet. Is it still more or less Stand of the weak or has the plot kicked in already? Do we finally know who the villain or Gappy's second half is?  <br>the plot has always been going anon and probably.</br>  Never read or watched anything to do with JoJo<br><br>Is the anime worth watching? I mean the reboot</br></br>  I found a doujinshi of Jotaro using star platinum to double penetrate Anne.<br><br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=manga&amp;illust_id=38428228</wbr></br></br>  <br>Just read the manga first<br>It's faster than watching hours of anime</br></br>  what are the best non meme subtitles for part 1 and 2?    <br>Part 8 seems to have fewer villains that many of the other parts, and each fight adds more to the plot better than any other part. We don't know who the villain is, but we do know both of Gappy's halves.</br>  <br> I mean the reboot <br>There is no reboot. The current anime is the only anime. There was an OVA series which did some of Stardust Crusaders but not particularly faithfully.<br>Watch Parts 1, 2 and 3 then read the rest.</br></br></br>   yfw Some-Stuffs is unkill   <br>One side is  Kira  and the other side is  Josufumi who is basically this world's Josuke. </br>  <br>Crunchyroll's is fine for part 1 and 2.<br>It's part 3 where most of the issues lie.</br></br>  <br>NEVER! EVER! gonna read that.</br>  <br>You sure about that?</br>  <br>No. It's a common manga SFX. JoJo just popularized using it in anime I suppose.</br>  <br>Don't lie to me anon you disgusting lolicon</br>  <br>Wow, you're slow.<br><br>never ever</br></br></br>  <br>yes<br><br>I don't touch that stuff with a bargepole.</br></br></br>  <br>And "Kira" is Jotaro with a referenced name<br><br>Really it's three people.</br></br></br>  <br>He's not Jotaro either, really. He's a new character with minor references to both.</br>  <br>He's his own character that looks similar to Jotaro with Kira's name and Stand.</br>  Summon Gay Priest.  Is S&amp;W the most broken Stand in all of Jojo?<br> Take [Invincibility] from GER <br> Take [Speed] from MiH <br> Take [Spin] from Tusk </br></br></br>  <br> we do know both of Gappy's halves. <br><br> the other side is Josufumi who is basically this world's Josuke. <br><br>But we don't actually know that. All we know is that Karera THINKS she is Josefumi, I mean it's not confirmed or anything</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not, there are multiple ways of stopping the bubbles.</br>    <br>I don't think he's a red herring</br>  <br>Calling it now, S&amp;W is going to get a fuckhuge power boost at the end and will have to do crazy shit like removing relativity from the universe to beat the villain.</br>  <br>How do you even break the bubbles? I would think it's a little simpler than just popping them and I don't remember anyone doing that or trying to. I mean as you saw in this trap a guy just let him put a bubble in his skin and burst open</br>  <br> take speed from MiH <br>Could a bubble even touch it?</br></br>  <br> this trap <br>Wtf? I meant chapter</br></br>  <br>I think people are seriously overestimating what S&amp;Ws bubbles can do</br>  <br>Latest chapter showed that Gappy can make a fuckload of bubbles at once.<br>If he surrounds himself with bubbles or predicts Pucci's direction and lays down a wall of bubbles he could do it.<br><br>Pucci's probably going too fast to even notice tiny bubbles in his way and react.</br></br></br></br>  what the fuck was the point of Superfly  What would Soft &amp; Wet Requiem be capable of?  <br>Something completely unrelated to its original ability.</br>  <br>Whatever Gabby wants at that time the most</br>  <br>Araki liked the idea of a dude living on a tower like that.</br>  <br>It would make Josuke and Yasuho conjoined so they can always be together.<br><br>Always.</br></br></br>  What if Jonathan was a grill?  <br>Aww, that's cute.</br>  <br>What if you just killed yourself?</br>  <br><br><br>Both are very good questions.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Reboot <br><br>I don't think you know what that word means.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I hate how most genderbent fanart tends to just give most characters a set of tits along with a feminine face and be done with it. A female Jonathan would be very elegant, long haired and refined, though obviously naive about how za warudo works.</br>    <br>i'll bet hazamada girl fucking stinks</br>  <br> I'm evil. </br>  <br>Yukakun looks so dreamy</br>  <br>What pisses me off the most with R63 art is they either do what you say or they turn the girl version into a generic anime chick with the originals clothing or they have the character do shit they would never do, even in genderbent form</br>  <br>Dio looks more like David Bowie from that Labyrinth film.</br>  <br>I'mnotacleverman.jpeg</br>  <br>Seems like a stretch given pucci could casually dodge a punch ghosts punch. And it's not that when made in Heaven is active pucci would just see everything in slow motion. He'd see the bubbles. He'd probably just throw knives. But it would be interesting to know if Gappy could really take speed.</br>  <br><br> How you gonna want your haircut today, fam ? </br></br>  Post yfw YU voices Josuke in DiU.  <br>That's the thing, he's not going fast, he's just traveling at normal speed in a world that appears to be moving around him infinitely slowly.</br>  <br> fam <br>Stop this.</br></br>  <br>Dio would try to get the fortune via her pants<br><br><br>Designing is haaarrrrdddddd.<br><br><br>JUST</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> YU <br><br>Please elaborate.</br></br></br>  <br>This, it's so lazy when people draw a generic blond moe girl and say it's Giorno.</br>  <br>You know, the fuckwit who did bland generic anime voice number 352 for Johnathan, Joseph AND Jotaro.</br>  <br>From Persona 4. I think.</br>  <br> any woman showing midriff in the 1800s <br> existing <br><br>Is this better?<br><br><br>It's even lazier when they just draw Giorno</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Designing is haaarrrrdddddd <br><br>Not really, I like this Part 5 genderbend of Bruno's gang.<br><br><br>Oh, JYB. I don't know if Yusuke's voice actor is still doing work today, but him voicing Josuke along with Christopher Sabat voicing Okuyasu would be pretty neat.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but him voicing Josuke along with Christopher Sabat voicing Okuyasu would be pretty neat. <br>I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic.<br>Nice art though,</br></br></br>  <br> Generic moeblob faces and body types <br>If you need more proof that this is moeblob Giorno is 15 but looks like a fucking loli in this</br></br>  <br>why are the boobies so unnaturally defined</br>  <br>You wouldn't need to change much with Joseph(ine?) to make her a girl.</br>  <br>Yuropoor 15 year olds have that body shape, though. Americans look very old at 16 in comparison.</br>  <br>Yeah, It's because Yuropoors are all malnourished right?</br>  <br> Implying the artist fucking knew that </br>  <br>No, it's because Americans are fatasses.<br><br><br>Fujoshits are crafty, you mustn't forget that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, you literally can't defend it. The reason he did that was because the artist is trash and just made generic loliblob giorno because that's all he/she knows how to do</br>  <br> No, it's because Americans are fatasses. <br><br>Actually, the first guy has a point, you're half correct. The reason you could say yuropoors are malnourished is because food is more expensive in europe than it is in America. Poor people can buy food at much cheaper than in europe if they had any money.</br></br></br>  <br>Well I like the artist's version of generic moeblob Giorno, are you going to bitch and moan about it further?<br><br><br>On the continent and Ireland, yes, but the Britbongs can get a lot with a few pounds.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, you can defend it. <br><br>What the fuck would a 15 year old italian girl look like then? It would literally be Giorno with a more feminine face<br><br><br>I thought getting shot all the time would make Americans thinner.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How do I  git gud  at Mariah in hftf  <br>her hands are so tiny in that picture.</br>  <br>Hit and run</br>  <br>I'm actually talking about Britbongs. Bare with me because i'm literally basing this off a guy I know who lives in England and moved down to America for a month but I specifically remember him saying that food and apartments were cheap as fuck in America.<br><br><br> I thought getting shot all the time would make Americans thinner. <br>Mad yuropoor<br><br><br>Watch some vids of her, she has a meta</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  where is the option for multiplayer mode in heritage for the future? Could've sworn I somehow went straight into it first time I loaded up the rom, but now there's just challenge and story mode  <br>Just learn one of her 12 infinites like everyone in that shitty game has.</br>  <br>No, i'm just going to say you have shit taste and leave it at that. I mean, nothing wrong with liking moe shit but when they take a non-moeblob think and then genderbend it with a moeblob style, it pisses me off. Especially since they turned him into a loli<br><br><br> What the fuck would a 15 year old italian girl look like then? <br>Trish</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We earn more money in literally every job compared to Americans, so even though things cost a bit more we still consider it cheap. I always find it hilarious when Americans complain about games being $80, as if that's a lot of money or something.</br>  <br>Are you using fightcade or what? You need another player to press start in challenge/story mode or challenge somebody in fightcade.<br><br><br>Will try, I usually go for short combos and throws followed by a Bast charge</br></br></br></br>  <br>Britbongs are fat as fuark, literally the fattest fucks in EU.<br><br>Doesn't that say something about USA?<br><br>Also, since I'm a mad yuropoor I'm obliged to do this<br><br> go to school <br> get shot <br><br> go to the movies <br> get shot <br><br> go to the mall <br> get shot <br><br> go to an army base <br> get shot <br><br><br>So the face is the problem?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is no "multiplayer" mode in HFtF, you have to go on fightcade and challenge people on there which opens up the game.<br><br>Now, HFtF HD has a multiplayer version but that's only on PS3 and Xbox and i'm pretty sure you can't buy it because capcom doesn't have the rights to jojo anymore and can't sell the game.<br><br>Maybe someday someone will be able to rip the game from someones PS3 or Xbox and we can play it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So the face is the problem? <br>What do you mean?</br></br>  fuck is this tumblr shit  <br>People complain about it being $80 because it's always been cheaper and it doesn't matter where you are people are going to complain when you raise the price on something that has always been cheaper. I mean, you would complain if they made games $100, right? Or 20 more of whatever games cost in euro<br><br><br> Britbongs are fat as fuark, literally the fattest fucks in EU. <br> Doesn't that say something about USA? <br><br>No, what? I'm not sure which direction you're trying to go with this</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Man in the Mirror <br> No one asks him to change his ways </br>  <br>Quoted the wrong person, nevermind.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Fattest people of EU is amazed how fat you fucks are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No, what? <br>Maybe he's referring to the fact that Britbongs are influenced by American media more than the rest of Europe.  As a Britbong I must say that we're basically Micro-America, without the guns. </br></br>  <br> Fattest people of EU is amazed how fat you fucks are. <br>And?</br></br>  <br>SHUT UUUUUUUUUUUUUUP</br>  Let's talk about the new chapter you fucking retards<br><br>What do speculate about it from the images? What do you think they're talking about or saying?</br></br>  <br>They are conversing about how fabulous they are.</br>  <br> What do you think they're saying? <br>"Gee Gappy, how come you get TWO pairs of testicles?"</br></br>  <br> What do you think they're talking about <br>The pleasure of being cummed inside</br></br>  <br>We have the gist of it from a jap.<br><br>From what I remember, Google translate says Karera buys some new shoes and starts talking about Kira once she spots his apartment complex and she says he hid a rokokaka in a cupboard or something to heal his mother with it. Then the soccer twins attack and the one with the hand stub sets Karera on fire. Gappy puts it out with S&amp;W and she gets the fuck out of there. Apparently the hand stub twin can transfer not only what he touches but also what the soccer ball touches, and the other twin kicks it at things.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm friends with both of them irl. Love those peeps.</br>  <br>thats legit pretty funny, i just watched that episode with a friend<br><br>star platinum pre-nerf super OP</br></br></br>  What is the best emotional moment in the series and why is it Johnny's dad?  <br>Show him this my hot OC of him then, faggot</br>  <br>Because his father is finally proud to call him his child, something we all yearn for but will never achieve.</br>  What will Jojo inevitably have a shitty crossover special with cringe-worthy dialogue with?  <br>bigger<br><br><br>Not in a manga or anything. It already did have a "crossover" with Ore monogatari awhile ago though, i'll post the pic after this</br></br></br></br>  <br>Trans DIO</br>    <br>wrong meme</br>  What are some other cool bugs like the Rhinoceros beetle that Araki may obsess over?  <br><br>Had to google it since I couldn't find it in my folders.</br></br>  So, did the editors see lesbians and make him change it or what?  <br><br>I will and I'll post his reaction.</br></br>  <br>They wanted a love interest for Jolyne. <br><br>HURR FEMALE LEAD!?!?!?!?!??!? WHERES HER ROMANTIC PARTNERS!?!?!? YOU CAN'T HAVE A FEMALE LEAD WITHOUT ROMANCE DURR</br></br></br>  <br>so it would turn into Yashou's poontang?</br>  <br>i know im a faggot for crying in this scene</br>  <br> OK you want a love interest? <br> He's in the prison in the first place because he killed his last girlfriend and the guy with whom she cheated on him.  <br> How's that? <br><br>Fucking Araki.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like the way he handled it. He pretty much said fuck you, i'm going to do it but not in a good way. Her love interest is going to be a psychotic, stalking muderer</br>  <br>Stop making things up, we don't know anything about why she turned into a he.</br>  <br>But that's literally what happened you idiot. Araki's editors want Araki to have a love interest for Jolyne</br>  <br>Magic Boy BT's nice to read but it has some bullshit like in JoJo part 2. Gorgeous Irene's not that good and her makeup powers are more nonsensical and overpowered than both the Ripple and Spin. At least Jonathan's in it.</br>  <br>You do not have a source.</br>  <br>It was in an interview, let me look it up</br>  <br>what? its britbong slang, like how Americlaps say homie</br>  <br> its britbong slang <br>You're either pulling my chain or are terribly misinformed.</br></br>  <br> its britbong slang <br> Good luck in your endeavors to bait people </br></br>  <br>It's not britbong slang, it's negro slang</br>  <br>Same thing.</br>  <br>Very ironic when you use that image</br>  <br><br><br>I'm honestly not baiting, every urban youth in London says fam. I'm a Londoner who uses that as well.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm from Bongland, London in fact where the nig nogs are and can confirm they've been saying fam for like 2 years now</br>  <br>You don't need to save face on an anonymous board. You're not actually looking it up because you know you only heard it here.</br>  <br>Urban youth = Negro<br><br>Only white trash lad lingo is considered britbong slang.</br></br></br>  How did people ever read part 5? It's boring as shit and the scans are abominable  <br>No, this has been a thing for literally years. you dolt. I don't doubt it too because that's definitely the thing Shonen Jump would do at the time.</br>  <br> love interest  <br>Hermes is probably more of a love interest than Anasui. He's just a weird guy that suddenly wants to marry Jolyne.</br></br>  <br>I readed it with my eyes</br>  <br>Indeed, I'm aware that Jojo fans have had the tendency to make up unfounded rumors for a long time now. Still not seeing your source.</br>  <br><br> Londoners <br>Why am I not surprised?</br></br></br>  <br>Where's your source that it's not true? Why do you care so much in the first place?</br>  <br>Because Bruno is best JoJo side character</br>  Not sure if any of you guys have played Guilty Gear but if the people who made it were to make a JoJo game it would literally be the greatest thing ever  <br>Where's your source that it IS true? You can't bring something up, say "This definitely happened" and not back up your claims.</br>  <br>I liked everyone except Giorno,Fugo and Diavolo</br>  <br>Burden of proof is on you because you're the one insisting you know for sure.</br>  <br>It's about as misunderstood as Heaven's Door.</br>  <br><br>It's not britbong you faggot. It's a US african american slang that carried over in hip hop where London's pathetic wannabe gangstas got wind of it. Your hip hop is shit btw.</br></br>  <br>Still not seeing a source</br>  <br> Britbong hiphop <br>Now I HAVE to hear this</br></br>  <br>Neither am I, fuckwit.</br>  <br>Source of what? You're saying you know without a doubt, I'm saying you're making it up. You're the only one with anything to prove here.</br>  <br>The Gorillaz are trip hop, does that count?</br>  <br>Retard</br>  <br>Not really. It's experimental but when it does have a hip hop song the actual rappers are guest people who aren't brits. At least i'm pretty sure they aren't brits</br>  <br><br>No. Shit like Dizee Rascal is English hip hop and it's fucking awful.</br></br>  <br><br>Sorry anon. Looks like you lost an argument on the internet. I'm sure you'll recover though.</br></br>  <br> Now I HAVE to hear this <br>You've never heard Dizzee Rascal, Professor Green, Tinie Tempah or Rizzle Kicks?</br></br>  <br><br>Del the funky homosapien is one of their most frequent rappers and he's US.</br></br>  <br>It's rapping in an English accent.</br>  <br>Don't h8 man it feels good to be British especially when I'm not one of those "typical lad" type people who say banter and shit, or a nig</br>  <br>Can't tell if you're joking or not because no. <br><br><br>Yeah, I know Del is their "main" rapper</br></br></br></br>  <br>But I'm British too, I'm just not in a shit "urban" city where faggots say fam.</br>  <br><br>Since this is so suprising to you I'm guessing you two are the standard neckbeard that stays at home all day. It shouldn't have been this suprising if you actually were a Londoner.<br><br><br>What do you know about what is London slang, you stay at home and shitpost on le 4chinz all day. I'm not gonna take your word over mine, a person who actually lives here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mad britbong? You sure are making a lot of assumptions</br>  <br>Yeah it's pretty bad in London I feel u man get a lot of "what u saying fam" here. <br><br>I just wanna play my games and read JoJo,  also to see what the fuck is under Gappys hat c'mon Araki </br></br></br>  the last 50 posts here are simply terrible.<br><br>including this one</br></br>  <br>At least you have plenty of people in your area that like JoJo. I live in the  North East. </br>  <br><br>Its the best part you fag. Best stand fights, best story and best characters. Side characters actually are worth a damn instead of just being enemy fodder.</br></br>  <br> plenty of people in my area who like jojo  <br><br>No way man London is just a bunch of nigs and. Literally no one I know reads it</br></br></br>  Is Diamond Still Not Confirmed?  Is Gappy part dog?  <br>I'd argue that the entire thread is trash</br>  <br>The side characters are the only ones worth a damn.</br>  <br> best part <br>But that's wrong.</br></br>  <br> best story <br>Story was a mess even by JoJo standards, guy. Silver Chariot Requiem onwards is such a clusterfuck with that evolution shit (which is never mentioned again in future parts).</br></br>  <br> assumptions <br><br>They're right 90% of the time, so it's more of a good estimate. "Fam" is used a lot here, if you're 18-24 in London, you'd have most certainly heard it more than once.<br><br>The fact that you didn't implies many things, one being you're not from London, and the other is that you're the "school shooter" of your area.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What do you know about what is London slang, you stay at home and shitpost on le 4chinz all day. I'm not gonna take your word over mine, a person who actually lives here. <br><br>Most of my family live in London and I have ti visit that shithole all the fucking time. Also doesn't matter where you live fuckwit, the fact is 'fam' doesn't come from that twat centre, it comes from america.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That onwards is, but that's not the bulk of the stroy. Also, its not much of a clusterfuck. Polnereff stabs himself with the arrow in a ditch attempt at life preservation, Silver Chariot Reqium goes nuts and switches everyone's souls and tries to protect the arrow, Doppio dies in Buccerati's body, Diovolo gets the arrow, tries to stab himself, the arrow is attracted to Giorno and stabs him instead, Giorno fucks Diovolo's shit up. Pretty simple. Its never mentioned again because the arrow only appears in one more part and no-one in that part has any interaction with Giorno to find out. Plus I'd imagine Giorno keeps it a pretty well guarded secret anyway. <br><br>The rest of the story was completely coherant. Kind of reminds me of the Warriors.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The fact that you didn't implies many things, one being you're not from London, and the other is that you're the "school shooter" of your area. <br> more assumptions <br>I'm not even one of the guys arguing where fam came from or if people use it in Britain. I'm not going to even go into a stupid argument like that because I don't live in Britain so I don't know what the fuck slang they commonly use.<br><br>Besides that I was talking about how the guy made stupid assumptions about those people being "standard neckbeard that stays at home all day" and "you stay at home and shitpost on le 4chinz all day". Saying shit like that just gives off the vibe of someone who is mad and is just throwing out random insults<br><br> "school shooter' <br>No seriously what's with these idiotic assumptions?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> London <br><br>I made a group of people into Jojo here, it's not that hard. Just tell them its about how there's a gay vampire that can stop time and they get hooked right in.<br><br><br>Hmm it seems that you are right. I do remember a few East Coast tracks using the term back in the late 90s. Nowadays it is used here a lot more though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=B4K<wbr>Vuy60dV8</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Make me OC Doc<br><br>I liked the video though</br></br></br>    <br> OC <br>Make the new hottest jojo meme</br></br>  Oh man this bear girl is giving me a wicked boner  <br>he already did</br>  <br>best English Josuke: <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=S47<wbr>igI5w6Hc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>You can't force a meme, that's the worst way to do it.<br><br>Then again we do have Gay Priest and Hotpants, It'll come by eventually.<br><br><br>It's not original original though, it's an edit of a meme.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> genderbent part 5 cast looks completely unchanged <br><br>it is unreal how ridiculously feminine the part 5 gang is portrayed</br></br></br>  does anyone have the picture of josuke handing the part 4 manga to the alien guy sorry to bother. he says like you can drop the act now , here's the manga or somthing  <br>Last 50?

Considering it's from the 90s</br>  <br>Yeah sure. Anime for the first three parts. If you like it, manga. Part 1 isn't very good, but it's also short so at least push through that.

Doc has been here for months, same with meppz but for not as long</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Halfway through reading the manga i started hearing Justin Cook.

When don't need more forced memes</br></br>  <br>It's not a meme though, so fuck off.</br>  <br>It is if you keep posting it and forcing it down peoples throat.</br>  <br>Part 1 is pretty bad after a point but it's short part 5 is absolute shit</br>  <br>Epic bro. Super epic.</br>  <br><br><br><br> literally arguing about whether something is a meme or not <br><br>Are you guys proud of yourselves? Like legit, lmfao</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i made this picture about half a year ago and this shit is just stupid</br>  <br>Finally, a straight black man entered this thread</br>  Are the Golden Wind English translations really that bad? I'm French and have read the entirety of it, and I found it fantastic. I don't understand the hate for it.  <br>Fuck off polnareff</br>  <br>I know french, let me handle this.<br><br><br>T'es un mec costaud</br></br></br></br>  <br>But Pucci is here.</br>  <br>I thought he was leaving, and the cosplayer don't count.</br>  I'm so fucking sick to death of this cross-dressing 9 year old.  <br>Votre go√ªt est de la merde<br><br>I know just enough french to say that. Had to look up taste though.<br><br>But really, it's not that bad FOR ME at least, I read the english fan translation and I liked part 5.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Try reading them for yourself, you'll see what we mean</br>   Reading part 5 <br> Chapters suddenly jump from 485 to 491 <br><br>Fuck this part</br></br></br>  <br>Golden Wind is definitely one of the best parts, English fandom reads the shit translation and can't understand subtle characterization.</br>  <br><br>How is the retranslation coming along?</br></br>  <br>Batoto right? The old scans have chapters lumped together instead of individually, you reached the end of the new translation, so it jumped you ahead to the next grouping.</br>  <br> Dio would try to get the fortune via her pants <br>Now for the hard hitting questions.<br>Would Dio manage to succeed in seducing a female Jonathan in order to obtain her fortune? Would a male Erina win her heart first, resulting in a fucked up love triangle that ends with Dio murdering Erina?<br>Would the resulting broken hearted Jonathan go along with it, only to realize that once they're married Dio planned to kill her all along?<br>Would they have a ridiculous hotblooded battle resulting in Jonathan awakening her Joestar battle spirit?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes to all, which would result in fem-jonathan marrying Speedwagon</br>  <br>But Speedwagon is gay.</br>  <br>Speedwagon is an old man, and he'll die once Dio discovers the stone mask out of shame for his defeat later on.</br>  <br>This would make a pretty interesting reboot.</br>  <br>Old? Wasn't he in his late 20s?<br><br>Also, how would Dio find the properties of the stone mask if his first plan was just to marry into the wealth?</br></br></br>  <br>Female Jonathan discover the blood reaction of the mask and knowing it Dio plan to use it to kill her (it would look like an accident), but he first use it in Danny and watch how he turn into a vampire.</br>  <br>I've been drinking all fucking night and somehow I thought you said Zeppeli.<br>I don't know, as cruel as it is to say; Speedwagon just fits the role of a one man virgin more than that of a married character. Also Jonathan isn't a slut, and being psychologically manipulated by Dio doesn't count. If she ends up living, she'd probably die without touching a man again for the rest of her life.</br></br>  <br> If she ends up living, she'd probably die without touching a man again for the rest of her life. <br>So Giorno would be Joseph's father?</br></br>  Is Part 8 the only part that acknowledges real life musicians? I always assumed that none of them existed so nobody would think it was weird that you named your stand after a Led Zeppelin album or something. Do all the bands and albums actually exist in the SBR universe?  So did Johnny know that he would be transferring the disease onto himself?  <br>During the shitty psedo marriage Dio could've gotten her knocked up, Id basically be Giorno but with more personality and crazy bullshit charisma.<br>I'd make for a pretty wacky story.</br></br>  <br>I don't even play my xbox anymore. If I knew how to work that shit I would do it for you guys.</br>  I'm evil?  <br> Dio+femJonathan=Giorno*Joseph <br><br>Jesus christ I'd want to see that character</br></br></br>  <br>Man, imagine how he would have turned out</br>  <br>That's what he was going for.</br>  <br> I'm evil? <br>Not with that happy pure smile you aren't.</br></br>  <br> Dio+femJonathan=Giorno*Joseph <br><br>Can someone draw that? That sounds incredible</br></br></br>  <br> Is Part 8 the only part that acknowledges real life musicians? <br>Part 3 recognizes Weird Al (and by extension Michael Jackson) and The Beatles<br>Part 4 recognizes Prince and I think Hendrix<br>Part 5 recognizes Tupac and Snoop Dogg<br>There might be more, but I can't think of anything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nigger there is so much more pretty much every stand and atleast half of every user is also named after bands or musicians</br>  <br>Dio almost managed to seduce the male Jonathan so I'd say he could manage it. <br><br>Girl Jonathan might love Erina, but you know there's no way in Hell George wouldn't have already had dio and jonathan betrothed by the time he took Dio in, and jonathan might throw a fit depending on how dio treated her and how much she liked dude erina but she'd eventually acquiesce because jonathan is a good child at heart and wouldn't want to dissappoint her father.<br><br>Truth is, in this situation? Dio would already have basically won without doing anything. The only saving grace is his impatience, and the fact that even as a girl, Jonathan wouldn't stand for Dio killing her father. Which in turn leads to ripple vs vampire bullshit, same as before, because Dio can't handle being backed into a corner.<br><br>So, differing circumstances, same outcome essentially.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What Tupac and Snoop dogg related things are in part 5</br>  <br>They're Narancia's favorite music artists, but they're only mentioned on his character profile page. Just like how his favorite TV show is Hokuto no Ken.</br>  <br>Psychologically he'd be a fucking mess. Inheriting Dio's traits and mixing them with the purest Joestar blood available is a recipe for fucking madness. He'd be driven for power for one, but only in a way that benefited the "greater good" probably struggling for years if or not he should use people as pawns and tools for success. He'd fuck with people in an endearing way and be genuinely entertaining with an over the top charisma while still retaining a resolved and level headed personality the majority of the time. The more I think about what this character would be like, the more he sounds like fucking Reinhard if Reinhard was on crack and enjoyed fucking with people for amusement.</br>  <br> pretty much every stand and atleast half of every user is also named after bands or musicians <br>Well yeah, but it doesn't come up. My original post was asking whether or not real life bands or artists exist in the JoJo universe because nobody ever acknowledges the fact that all the stand names are taken from those.</br></br>  Why is whitesnake such a based stand?  <br>You forgot to mention how ridiculously hot they'd be</br>  <br> Girl Jonathan might love Erina, but you know there's no way in Hell George wouldn't have already had dio and jonathan betrothed by the time he took Dio in, and jonathan might throw a fit depending on how dio treated her and how much she liked dude erina <br>She pretty much undoubtedly would, and I doubt that a Joestar would give up that easily. At first maybe she would come to accept it, but I can picture Jonathan going out of his way to prove to his father that his love for Erina is real. Why would George try and force them together anyway? Dio has no fortune, he's more of a son and step brother to her.</br></br>  <br>That's pretty gay, man.</br>  <br>You didn't contradict me, now did you? Because it's true.</br>  <br>You haven't read enough schlocky Victorian-era literature apparently, it's just how these things go. Some guy saves your life, you repay him by taking in his son and uniting your bloodlines blah blah blah. <br><br>Adopted siblings/people raised together form ages much earlier than 12 were married all the time in those kinds of stories. And a son-in-law is the same thing as a son when all you have is a daughter in Victorian England.<br><br>BUT, you're right, jonathan wouldn't just give up that easily. Point being, vampire beatdown still happens, just with more boobs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would George betroth his only daughter to a son of a tramp? He wouldn't be interested in continuing the blood blood/hair tradition? There certainly would be competition between Dio and Eric(?)<br><br><br>Can you inherit personality that much? How did we go from Jonathan to Joseph then? Erina was mild, Lisa Lisa doesn't seem that off the wall.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i want avdol in the pucci after pose</br>  <br>Speaking of R63, genetics, personalities, and Lisa Lisa, I find it interesting to note just how similar Jotaro is to Lisa Lisa.</br>  <br>Why would you want a Muslim doing that pose?</br>  <br>Well you got me there, all I know about the Victorian Era is the Irish Potato famine, and the French Revolution. It still seems pretty odd, George didn't have an arranged marriage himself and I'm pretty sure he values the hapiness of his daughter since that's the closest he'll have to his wife. He's also an upstanding gentleman, and seemed perfectly fine with the hospitality that he offered Dio in giving him a room and board.<br>There's a chance that Dio could actually pressure George into an arranged marriage, but George is a gentleman and should back down once fem Jonathan proves that she really loves Erina in a typical Joestar way.</br></br>  <br>because i want a new meme in order to destroy the other meme</br>  <br>Avdol isn't autistic enough of a character to be a meme like Gay Priest. It'd just end up dying like the "Gay Stand" and " Josefumi is here now". Gay Priest is forever.</br>  Anyone ever take notice of the fact that Valentine gave Johnny a very similar choice to the choice Dio gave Jonathan?<br><br> Jojo is winning the fight <br> "I know you're winning but (I can let you live with your wife forever/I can bring Gyro back alive and healthy) and I'll leave you alone forever if you just let me go" <br><br>Both bad guys were also full of bullshit. But it's interesting to note that while Jonathan didn't even consider it, Johnny was sorely tempted, or at least torn up pretty bad by the possibility.  Man, Johnny and Gyro were so gay for each other. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then conveniently Erina would get in a hunting accident and die, Dio would seize the marriage THEN cue ripple vs vampires but with Dio dying instead otherwise no Joestar successor.<br><br>If Part 3 needs to happen, Giorge could just go mad and become a vampire in a lust of power.</br></br></br>  <br> Giorge <br><br>Oh fuck you, that's absolutely perfect.</br></br></br>  Just finished Part 7. Gonna spurge and type out some thoughts i had seeing as im done with this series until part 8 ends or Araki dies or cant finish it. It feels like a series that should be read all together <br><br>7&gt;4&gt;2&gt;3&gt;5&gt;6&gt;1<br><br>Pretty much how i  stand  right now, 2 is really hazy in my memory so that is an asterisk.<br><br>Part 1 was pretty bad in every aspect and by itself is god awful and really only is there for a prolouge to extend the universe and introduce Dio.<br><br>Part 2 is hazy in my memory but i remember liking how nothing was super far fetched in terms of adventure and everything felt very "tight" and "together" including how it was a 2 man team with simple powers.<br><br>Part 3'd format annoyed me but the characters motivation and path to travel to take down felt justified and rewarding. It dragged on and by the time they hit the 2nd pair of stands i wanted no more of it. Didnt really care for any of the main group besides Joseph and Jotaro seemed like he could be cool in time but didnt go any where.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Part 4 had the best setting in my opinion, the small town setting and them fighting in a place they wanted to protect was great. Josuke and Okuyasu were the only two out of the main group i really cared for though, and both have fucking cool stands with Josuke's being my favorite of the Joestar line. Also had Kira which was the best villian and also had a fantastic stand and with Bite the Dust going a little crazy near the end it never reached complete bullshit that part 5 or 6 did.<br><br>Part 5. Fucking awful story progression, Gio is a nothing shit character, the whole Requiem shit ruined everything at the end, and Araki basically leaving everything to Buccellati or Gio to solve. Fucking Fugo got one fight that he didnt even fully win by himself. Group dynamic and intersting stand designs are really what made this not be lower than 6<br><br><br>Part 6. Jolyne is by far the most competent and not fucking retarded in battle Jojo, she is just stuck in a bad story. Didnt care for the prison setting, Pucci being some complete bullshit levels of OP with THREE fucking stands that are each complete bullshit, cast dynamic was nothing despite there being good characters like Weather Report, Anasui, and FF. Forcing Dio into the storyline again was unnecessary and i really feel like there was a way better way to introduce a multiverse theory into the story so Araki could "reset" and expand through different times.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 6 that low <br> 3,2,5 that high. <br>Jesus. I'll respect your enjoyment though.</br></br></br>  <br> even if she had a daughter? </br>  <br><br>Part 7 didnt feel like the other parts, Araki got his shit together and fixed alot of complaints that i happened to have and molded his story complete different. The whole thing was an adventure from the beginning with characters having their goals set out infront of them while being dragged unknowingly into a conspiracy and inturn being exposed to stands and choosing what they would do. Also really liked how it was a small group again and instead of relying on stands it was them relying on their abilities (even though Johnny uses a stand it never felt like one until the end and instead like an extension of himself) <br>fucking word limit wouldnt fit in in the last post</br></br></br>  <br> Then conveniently Erina would get in a hunting accident and die <br>That's what what I thought would happen from the start, the only difference being that "convenient death" would be triggered by Dio himself. After the death Jonathan would be heartbroken and easily maipulatable into getting married, Dio would likely try to worm his way in by being a shoulder to cry on to help her through the heartbreak.</br></br>  <br> There's no way any combination of those genes could be anything other than 10/10, period. </br>  <br> vampire George <br>Disgusting, just make Dio take Jonathan body after giving birth.</br></br>  <br>A vampire Jorge is disgusting but not a transgender Dio? And what? Fem-Jonathan would fight in the third trimester? Are you fucking mad?</br>  <br> Josuke and Okuyasu were the only two out of the main group i really cared for though <br><br>How could you not love Koichi and Rohan?</br></br></br>  <br>Because he is best stand.</br>  So what happened to Rohan, Joseph, and Giorno during the universe reset?  <br>Rohan is too busy making manga to notice.<br><br>dunno about the other 2.</br></br></br>  <br>Pucci and those whole ending chapters around him steamrolling through everything and everyone ruined 6 for me.

Family Guy for weeaboos who won't own up to their adoration for the American version  <br>why...</br>  it's a comedy that lasted forever without jumping the shark  <br><br>I should rewatch just for the creepy shit she does.

I think the end that WW is envisioning is a haruno end where 8man tells yukino that she wasn't the one able to fulfill his genuine request and that the only capable of doing that was none other than her superior sister, haruno.</br></br>  <br>He certainly hates Yukino to some extent<br><br>Will she ever find happiness?</br></br></br>  <br> Will she ever find happiness? <br>Yes,  in America. </br></br>  <br>Because someone accused her of being unfair for no fucking reason and it destroyed her self-esteem.<br><br>What a great friend you have here Yui.</br></br></br>  <br> implying it makes a difference in this series' fanbase </br>  Yui has no romantic feelings for 8man.<br>Iroha's feelings are not genuine.</br>  <br> where I live <br><br>Im fine with that</br></br></br>  <br>Man, talk about a nostalgia bomb.</br>  <br>Isn't Yukino not holding back the reason why she likes her?</br>    What were they doing alone in the infirmary?  <br>Being reminded.</br>  <br>Why was Yukino disqualified from the marathon for taking a break when Hachiman and Hayato completely stopped running themselves?</br>  <br>Amen.</br>  <br>Obviously medical staff determining her unfit to finish. Both 8man and Hayama were fine minus the former tripping on his own feet.</br>  <br>Why were his eyes quivering?<br>Why was she smiling?<br>Why did she lean in?<br> Why did Yui just stand and watch? </br></br></br></br>  8man should marry Yui and have a platonic relationship with Yukino.<br>Sex is a platonic activity too, so it's not wrong, and Yui definitely wouldn't mind, right?</br>  <br>What would she have done if 8man kissed her? Would she go with it  then do dirty things to him ?</br>  <br>only if yui gets to platonically make out with yukino while 8man platonically fills her with his 8 inches</br>  <br>They're in the infirmary, with a bed, and curtains, of course she would.</br>  hey guys anyone have the oregairu version of this picture? :C thanks in advance u memesters<br><br> not having saved every picture youve found <br>damn im beta</br></br></br>  <br>She'll do it in the moment, then only after it's done she realizes what happens, then turns into tsundere</br>  wtf u fagot kill yourself i fucking suck http://i.imgur.com/NtbCHeA.jpg  What sort of confession from Hikki do you think Yui day dreams the most about?  <br><br> Why were his eyes quivering? <br>His injury was making him wince in pain, of course his eyes would look like they were quivering.<br> Why was she smiling? <br>They were talking about her love, hayama-kun.<br> Why did she lean in? <br>She didn't, it was an anime only scene which FEEL fucked up.<br> Why did Yui just stand and watch? <br>Because she cares for both of them and she is genuinely happy that her two best friends are platonically getting closer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I want you to be my   bitch ,Yui.</br>  What will Yui do while Yukinon and Hikki are platonically exchanging oral sex in the club? Will she wait outside or watch?  <br> She didn't <br>It was only implied in the LN.</br></br>  <br>Probably the end of their "someday" date, 8man will take her to some romantic little vista where they can be alone. He'll square his shoulders, take a deep breath and get her attention with "Yuigahama, I need to say something." He'll stumble horribly, probably doing more mumbling and internal monologuing than saying actual words but the intent will still be crystal clear, and she'll throw herself at him so hard 8man will think he just got hit by an NFL linebacker.</br>  <br>Watch and hope that she can mop up their fluids after  like the dog she is </br>  <br>No it wasn't one. It's just wishful thinking on your part.</br>  Anyone have the links to Yui's diary/interlude? I keep hearing about how sad it is.  <br> NFL linebacker <br>More like a truck.</br></br>  <br>I don't know, the anime filled in the blanks of Hikki's first person perspective by putting us in third person.<br>And it would explain why somewhere in that moment, he felt a sting from his injury.</br></br>  <br>Truck-kun get out of my Yahari thread</br>  <br>Yukino is OTP with Hayato</br>  <br>I wonder if Yui has a dam filled with dere to unleash on him too. I wonder what kind of GF she would be.</br>  <br>See<br/></br>  <br>Complete perfection.</br>  <br>Too bad we confirmed that the Y girl Hayama likes was actually Yui</br>  <br> He likes Yui <br> Can't act because of Miura <br> He knows she likes 8man <br> He knows she cares about him a lot <br> This makes him mad <br> He can't do anything about it regardless </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying that Hayama and Yukino have got over each other. </br>  <br><br>Holy shit no wonder he says "I feel inferior to you"<br><br>Can't be Yukino because Yukino only likes 8man as platonic friends</br></br></br></br>  <br>Now that's alpha</br>  <br> Their past and future become one and conclude in the present. </br>  <br><br>Except that he ships 8man x Yui and he actually cheered for Yui way back in S1.</br></br>  <br>From what we know if Hayama started hitting on Yui 8man would go ballistic.<br><br>I wonder what Yui would do if she found out that 8man gets jelly over her.</br></br></br>  <br>The fact that he's a cuck is old news, newfriend</br>  I ship Iroha with Tobe  Do you think Yukino thinks about Hachiman falling in love with her?<br><br>Fuck what were her thoughts during infirmary and roller coaster scenes</br></br>  <br>We all do</br>  <br>My nigga.<br><br><br>She probably doesn't think 8man would fall fer her just like 8man thinks she would never fall for him.<br><br>He's pretty much said it straight to her face that he isn't attracted to her and that he has no interest in dating her.<br>Although this was back when they were still really mean towards each other.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would kill for Yukino perspective novels, especially if they end up together</br>  And Yui cheered Miura x Hayama  <br>Yukino has no clue that 8man might have feelings for her. As far as she knows it is one sided, that is why she beats around the bush with it. <br><br><br>I don't remember that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Imagine how torn she would be if Hayama actually does like one of her best friends.</br>  <br>Tha-that's enough!„ÄÄThe massage is over and I'm going to return to the clubroom!<br>(at the bottom) Ah<br><br>Is it still hopeless?<br>Se n paii <br><br>Hyaaan..<br> sfx: (anything that describes the sound of air blowing in one's ears) <br><br> *TL note: Iroha or Death </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Miura would be pissed and grill Yui hard about it. <br><br>Does Miura know that Yui only has eyes for Hikio?</br></br></br>  <br>I want to see more scene between Miura and Yui</br>  So does Hachiman actually like Yukino or the ideal image of Yukino? Because the image of her he keeps making keeps getting shattered (until she reaches final form in Vol 12 most likely)  <br>She knows but doesn't like it because she either knows she's going to get hurt by him or she just finds Hikio really gross.</br>  <br>I'm glad the manga adapts more little scenes like that pic.<br>They also did the sensei ramen date and 8man playing guitar.</br></br>  To lewd or not to lewd is the question.  I want to love Shovel    <br>I would say lewd but you guys dont understand how to lewd properly. Being lewd doesnt mean being stupid whores. It doesn't mean asking for cum. Being lewd is simpler than that. Lewdness is an art form that must be subtle yet daring. It is hard to perfect. But all the lewd I ever see is just girls with condoms or acting like sluts. Especially when it is cakes they must retain their purity while displaying the lewd</br>    <br> they watch you unzip your pants </br>  <br>This is how i like my lewds. No dirty stuff pls.</br>  <br>I like you, but i hate yo, but i like you</br>  <br>The manga chapters do it best.</br>  <br>What is the color of her panties?</br>  <br>Lewdness is meant to be used to show love and emotion. It is not something just to beat your dick at. It is meant to be erotic yet teasing. Not rude degrading trash.

But if Kurumi ran up then the killing events don't make sense.</br>  What does Gurashi means?  <br>What if the killing events happened at the same time? Its not like everyone will tought about a zombie outbreak right in the moment</br>  Gakkou Gracias  <br>The chapter made it look like these two were already on the roof while the trio ran up in the middle of this. Megunee knows who this girl is and I doubt "I regret letting her go" would get in instead of "she had to kill her boyfriend and I couldn't protect her". And then what, she ran down the steps and then back up?</br>  <br><br>Kurumi's flashback is part of a nightmare, so there's no way to tell how reliable it is. For all we know those events are all out of order in her dreams.</br></br>  <br>As has been said before, that scene in the manga is a dream so it's likely somewhat inaccurate. This series also loves using the unreliable narrator trope, there's no telling which account is right. Maybe none of them actually remember the whole story, they are under a mountain of stress after all.</br>  <br>It may be a plot hole, but is not like you have a better place to go when all hell breaks free and you don't know it in the moment, it cold be that she thought he tried to rape her</br>  <br><br>I get that. But where did she get the shovel if the killing wasn't on the roof?</br></br>  <br>Shee seems more like an inverted knight or page of spades from what little I understand. Her foolishness of being too energetic and willing to charge into battle are her downfall.</br>  <br>If she didn't charge into battle, who would? Even Megu-nee in her diary said no one else but Kurumi could fight the undead, so Megu-nee ended up relying on her despite knowing she was letting her student put herself in danger.</br>  <br>  Her foolishness of being too energetic and willing to charge into battle are her downfall. <br>She has already fallen from grace anon, the moment she couldn't face reality when she saw Megu-nee</br></br>  Lewd is the answer.  <br>  Megu-nee ended up relying on her despite knowing she was letting her student put herself in danger <br>That's called instinct of self-preservation, better them than me.</br></br>  Ep 3 countdown?  <br>I'm not blaming her. I'm just saying that Kurumi didn't do anything foolish. Someone had to fight, and she was the only one who could.<br><br>It's the same even now. Rii would be dead if Kurumi hadn't stopped the blow from the crossbow. And that's something only Kurumi could have done.</br></br></br>  <br>I know, but all this time did nobody thought about training to fight in case they need to? Its a zombie outbreak, you need to defend yourself and even more if you meet people you don't know</br>  <br>the eyes show how dead they are inside</br>  <br>Kurumi's just too reliable and dependable, I suppose.<br><br>I bet at least Miki would be a fighter if she was with them from the start.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, until very recently they were in the school, whether they had a pretty good routine already. They didn't need to fight. And I think deep down they thought they could keep living like that for a lot longer than they did. What fucked everything up was the chopper incident. Most of the school burned down. They couldn't keep living there after that.</br>  <br> STANDIING </br>  <br>Miki is trying to be helpful, even picking up a baseball bat would hugely change the team dynamic. Maybe Uni time will get her a weapon.</br>  <br>And that's why she won't make it alive, she's already dead and there's nobody that is still searching for a cure and thinking about use it for good and not to build a Rao's empire</br>  <br><br> ON THE EDGE <br><br> We make the same joke every thread anon </br></br></br></br>  Which  Guracho  do you guys think could  hold down their tequila?   <br>There's at least a preventative shot and if there's more of that to be found, it's at one of the marked points on the map.<br>I'm guessing that they only used one shot so far, if they were out the smart choice would be go to the source of it all.</br></br>  <br> Don't worry anon, I'm sure when the  dog dies  we'll think of new jokes </br>  <br>If she doesn't make it. who the fuck is going to fight the last boss? You think non-umbrella doesn't have some mutated monster hiding somewhere?</br>  I love her too much, help me /a/. I don't think my heart can take it if she dies.  <br>She's already dead.</br>  For those who knew about GG before the anime was announced, how did you find out about it?  <br>If watching a lot of zombie movies and reading, when you think that nothing could go wrong means everything will burn<br><br><br>And the radio-station, they just need to take care of radio-girl</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>None of them.<br><br>Yuki would start singing and dancing without ever stopping.<br>Miki would try to hook up with Kurumi.<br>Kurumi would try to pick up a fight with the bear.<br>Rin would  cry  until she sobered up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All of them, conventional tequila is weak shit compared to what they've been through.</br>  <br>Knew about it from manga threads but didn't read it until the anime started.</br>  <br>Searching for some manga, tags made me go "What the hell? Slice of life and horror?" and so</br>  <br>I wish they wore these the entire manga.</br>  <br>It'd certainly help, given the fact that it's slowly getting colder in the current chapters.</br>  <br>Anon please, Megu-nee is god-tier girl, you can't simply put her with those sluts just like that.</br>  <br>Rii is the most important Gurashi. <br><br>Because the world after the outbreak needs her fertility to repopulate earth.</br></br></br>  <br>I saw someone post about it in a manga thread.<br><br>Some time later, I was bored one day and decided to pick it up.</br></br></br>  <br>Rii would make an awful mother.</br>  <br>She may be the most fertile, but Kurumi has the superior genes. Which I guess makes sense since she's marriage material and not a slut.</br>  <br>Her genes are infected though.</br>  <br>I really doubt the infection alters you genetically.</br>  <br>What use do superior genes have, if she will die giving childbirth.<br><br>Shes not healthy at all. Now, she's even worse.<br><br>Rii is the healthiest and has great child-bearing hips capable of sustaining multiple births without problems.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I really doubt the infection alters you genetically. <br>http://pastebin.com/hgr2a3ZL<br> widespread infection may lead to mutation </br></br></br>  <br>It's so unfair that she started being the best after she got infected. And Rii started being a shit</br>  <br>It's talking about the virus there.</br>  <br><br>she's a perfectly fine strong woman both in mind and body, and will make the ideal wife. No infection can ruin this perfection.</br></br>  <br>Mutation means different versions of the virus.</br>  Why would you wear socks with a bathing suit?  <br>When you're trying to look sexy. And it works. That Miki is delicious.</br>  How does everyone feel about the anime so far?<br><br>I personally enjoy the fact that they were brave enough to make the dog and Megu-nee alive in the anime version, this way us fellow manga enthusiasts have something to look forward to in terms of plot differences.</br></br>  <br>sex appeal</br>  <br><br>Maybe, but the text is unclear. Besides, the explanation of the zombie virus (omega strain) is all censored, so we really don't know the details of the infection.</br></br>  <br>Is Kurumi expecting to spend time on her knees in that suit?</br>  <br>Why would you wear combat knee pads or a holster with bathing suit?<br><br>Also like to add Megu-nee is quite short in that pictures I always thought she was a bit taller than all the girls.</br></br></br>  <br>For some reason without sound it just looks like she's saying "mep, mip, mep mep"</br>  <br>Because wearing a bikini and socks can drive your dick like crazy<br><br><br>  Megu-nee alive in the anime version <br>  Megu-nee <br>  Alive <br>There's a lot of forshadowing making me think she's already death</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It'd certainly help, given the fact that KURUMI is slowly getting colder in the current chapters. <br><br>Fuck this fuck you</br></br></br>  <br>I'd have preferred a 1:1 adaptation, honestly.</br>  <br><br>Why would you thin they're actually alive?</br></br>  <br> Kurumi would try to pick up a fight with the bear. <br> Rii crying watching Kurumi decapitate her not sister with her shovel <br>Make it happen</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe? It's describing viral mutation, a common behavior when a virus is copied that many times over, then there are different versions to spread. That segment is describing specifics and the line you quoted is a disclaimer saying that, if the disease is widespread, the following strain information won't be entirely reliable because of mutations in the virus.</br>  <br>I wonder why?</br>  <br>Gardening?</br>  <br>Okay, but we don't know if the virus doesn't make any genetic alterations in the host, since the explanation for the omega strain is censored.</br>  <br>Oh a whole lot of being on her knees.</br>  <br>I'm not sure how many episodes this show is (I'm guessing the standard 13) I don't think they can do the entire 30 chapters into 13, plus I think they wanted to introduce the main cast right off the bat.<br><br>I still am hoping for a Miki mall flashback episode since the manga bungled the last scene pretty badly, Rii briefly alluded to Miki's time in the mall in episode 2 so I think there is hope.</br></br></br>  <br> I personally enjoy the fact that they were brave enough to make the dog and Megu-nee alive in the anime version <br> Megu-nee alive in the anime version <br> alive </br></br></br>    <br>And don't forget that zombies didn't pay attention to her even though she was standing right there</br>  <br><br><br>But there are no boys. Why would they want to look sexy?</br></br></br>  <br>They can easily fit 30 chapters in 13 episode, especially if they cut out the mall trip like it seems they might do.</br>  <br>I mean, you can't prove it either way when it's not mentioned.</br>  <br><br><br>It is in my opinion that she and the dog are very much alive in the anime, with the way they set out a plate of curry for her and they way that everyone knew to face her and thank her at the end of the library scene.<br><br>We won't know for sure until maybe episode 3 when/if they do Yuki's bathroom scene, but I'm still in the camp that Megu-nee is alive until I see it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that's an amazing colourization. Shame its not a larger resolution.</br>  <br>To seduce you, Dessy.</br>  <br>That's not what you said in </br>    <br>I want to be that spoon.</br>  <br> with the way they set out a plate of curry for her <br>Same scene in the manga. Also, it's not that they knew where to face it's that wherever they decided to face Yuki's mind put Megu-nee there.</br></br>  <br>OPT</br>  <br>I would think they will do a quick flashback to the mall to keep anime viewers up to date on where Miki initially came from. I guess to visually show that since Rii already mentioned about Yuki holding her own at the mall.<br><br>Maybe there is but I only found that one on /c/</br></br></br>  <br>No need to be rude anon, I meant the weather's getting colder.</br>  <br>Megu-nee's already dead. She is doing the exact same shit she did in the manga. <br> Getting interrupted mid-speech <br> Being inexplicably left behind <br> Advising Yuki when nobody is around <br> Everybody still loves and respects her deeply, they are just "rude" to her <br><br>Dog being alive fucks up progression, because it means that we don't know who let it die in the manga. Not to mention it shows up in the OP, with the girl students(Now zombies), Kei, the dog, and Megu-Nee. All of which are confirmed dead. If they kill the dog now, they need to completely change the way it dies. <br><br>They already fucked it up with Miki being in the group from the get-go  to which I assume only Mikifags are happy about , so the rest of this only leads to further problems.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More than a quick one since Kei is listed, probably half an episode to contain it would work if they hand wave the trip away.</br>  <br>what part was this?</br>  <br>Dog's alive, Miki chased after him in the first episode, but Megu-nee is dead, her grave's on the same place as it is in the manga, and it's not hard to think that "she" is always close to Yuki</br>      <br>Ch. 34 iirc</br>  <br><br>strange that I did think about this part, thought they didn't notice her because she was standing still. maybe she will become immune now? Maybe gain some kind of super-human powers? Certainly she won't turn, would she?</br></br>  <br>Someone made a thread dumping the first chapter and I've been sticked since back then.</br>  <br> Certainly she won't turn, would she? <br>Yes, she will.<br>They foreshadowed it with the pilot and with Radio-chan. It seems quite likely that the serum needs to be re-applied after a certain amount of time. She'll probably relapse while they're in the college.</br></br></br>    <br>Saw the first dump on /a/ 2 years ago and immediately felt like I was in for the long ride. I'm really glad to see this finally get an anime and some well deserved recognition.</br>  <br>Considering it's a nitroplus series, pain is bound to occur and she probably isn't special. Someone like Yuki would be more likely to have special benefits if she got infected, than Kurumi.</br>  <br>You gay?</br>  <br>boards.4chan.org/a/</br>  <br> Mfw I read it Manga-style </br>  <br>This image makes me feel really inadequate</br>  <br> 2 years ago <br> only 36 chapters <br><br>Does this mean at this pace it will be awhile before we get any new chapters? <br><br>I've marathoned the manga since the 1st episode came out and now I'm on pimps and needles because I just want to find out what is wrong with those 3 college girls</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a monthly, ergo it'll probably be about a month between chapters. All released chapters are translated at the moment.</br>  <br>It's montly. Started serialization in 2012, do the math.</br>  <br>Should've not marathoned it in the first place. Used to read a chapter per night so that I have an excuse to not sleep</br>  <br>It's a monthly release.</br>  <br>/a/ TL threads</br>  <br> Delusional = shit <br>fuck off, delusional Rii is great.</br></br>  <br>The zipper order should be flipped.</br>  <br>I like Rii much better now that she's delusional. Before I didn't really give a shit about her.</br>  I think the anime will end around where the manga is now since the ED has water/beach graduation trip in it. <br>I also believe megu-nee to already be dead due to her less active role in the show. Granted we haven't reached her manga death point either. But the fact that she stays with yuki makes me think she is dead. <br>I believe taroumaru will be present until the end and then become zombie as a Fuck you<br>Bear kun is not present in the ED so I believe rii will be cured of her crazy Shit. <br>The knife is in the OP with rii so I think her almost killing kurumi will be shown<br><br>Granted this is all stupid speculation with small things in the show. Fuck shit up mang</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is shit if she keeps on putting the other GGs in potential danger. I do really like that she went nuts from a plot-perspective, though.</br>  <br>Why wouldn't Megu-nee already be dead in the anime? She's long dead by the time Miki shows up. And they're not gonna get to Rii's crazy shit unless they fuck up the pacing.</br>  <br> Yuki is always the first one of the group to address megu-nee, then the rest say something in line with what Yuki said. <br> Everyone but Yuki 100% ignores her when she is the first one to speak.  <br><br>She is already dead.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Granted we haven't reached her manga death point either. <br>¬øQue?</br></br>  <br> Her grave is on the roof </br>  <br>Miki is here earlier than normal so it's not easy to pin down his timeline.</br>  <br>I thought it was the dog's, the mound is too small.</br>  <br> everyone interracts with the dog <br> no one interracts with Megu-nee except Yuki unless, prompted by Yuki <br> Megu-nee's ribbon on the grave <br>She's dead anon. I know it's hard to accept.<br>The dog isn't dead  yet </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's a memorial. She's not actually buried there,  She's wandering around the basement </br></br>  <br> She is shit if she keeps on putting the other GGs in potential danger. <br>Yeah like that one time when nothing happened.<br>They'll probably get into actual trouble once before she snaps back, but I'll reserve my judgement until they do.</br></br></br>  Someone figured out that the series is set in Yokohama and uses real schools, so I tried to figure out where the mall was.  <br>She doesn't have to be buried there for it to be a grave.</br>  <br>It's likely next episode is chapters 4-5, then either the Miki backstory episodes, or the teacher and the whole kurumi thing. I wonder if they'll pad the anime with more things but as far, the only "new things" the anime has are the scenes with the dog. They even had umaibo (and the balloons, so probably helicopter kun), and yeah it has the same Megunee being ignored (and especially the cross in the roof) that means she's already zombie</br>  <br>If they are H1Z1 zombies then nothing is wrong and they are working as intended.<br><br><br>Forgot about that before I saved it, oops.</br></br></br></br>    And information about the real school.  <br>No, I mean they should have their eyes narrowed when the zipper's down. Like they're not sure what they're looking at.</br>  <br>Balloons aren't happening, helicopter will show up some other way.</br>  <br>I got confused because of the test of courage. But I noticed the grave marker so I think it's megu-nees. <br><br>There's really not much left now that mii-kun is here. I think graduation will be ep 9 or 10 ish. Give a few episodes for graduation trip and radio chan and then some bullshit not university ending because anime in general sucks shit pacing from manga in general<br><br>Also the bear is already there so I think it indicates rii becoming crazying. Again wild speculation</br></br></br></br></br>  How would the Hidamaris do in the zombie apocalypse?  <br>No anon, you should flip the zipper without flipping the actual panels.</br>  <br>For some reason, the neatest thing to me is that it does have a piano there.</br>  <br>Mii-kun is only there earlier because Miki fans would get pissed if she didn't show up until 2/3s into the show. All the events of the first few chapters are happening as normal, Miki's just there too. We'll get a flashback episode sooner or later.</br>  <br>Miyako would be the last one to go down</br>  <br><br>Gotcha. I didn't want to be mean with it.<br><br>Unfortunately the panels aren't all the same size so it would be easier to flip, even if I saved the .psd.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Graduation will be the end of it, anything else will ruin the adaptation.</br>  <br> Balloons aren't happening <br>Why would you think that? They brought up the balloons in ep 2.</br></br>  <br><br>That's cool, I tried looking for the mall for a little while the last time you brought it up but I couldn't find it myself. Nice to see that you found it.</br></br>  Rewatching still and when megu and is having breakfast and then goes with yuki for the 1 on 1 lesson yuki runs on ahead while megu-nee is slow. Then sakura sensei leave without shutting the door while the 3 gurachos look on in sadness<br><br>Megster confirmed kill</br></br>  <br>Read that chapter again, it's largely fluff. There's no reason to waste time on it.</br>  <br>That chapters was largely flufff, but that's how they got the balloons in the anime too. It doesn't really explain your point. Why wouldn't balloons happen?</br>  <br><br>No way</br></br>  Do you prefer real mecha or super mecha?  <br>The only right answer is power armors, faggot.</br>  <br> mecha <br> real </br></br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super<wbr>_Robot<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_<wbr>Robot<br><br>Educate yourself, friend.</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br>You're going to trigger /k/ and maybe /v/ and we all know how annoying they get when they complain about this shit.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XVJ<wbr>TGLL2SnI</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.google.com.br/url?sa=t&amp;<wbr>rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=video&amp;cd=2&amp;c<wbr>ad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCAQtwIwAWoVChMI<wbr>6dSN0u_qxgIViBKQCh0zHw6S&amp;url=http%3<wbr>A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%<wbr>3D7u8mheM2Hrg&amp;ei=f4WtVamZGYilwASzvr<wbr>iQCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHOYJQOJ5Xxzzg1V-hIKl<wbr>_odfG2Qw&amp;sig2=Ur-qEU2HQ8QZtk8Pw6Pdt<wbr>Q<br>A slow begin.</br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Both.</br>  the only mecha i've liked was war in the pocket.  <br>real</br>  <br>What are the best subs for Votoms?</br>  <br>Well, "Real Robot" or "Super Robot"<br><br>For me, the answer is "Real Robot"<br><br>...the only issue is that lately, that "Real" has heavily been blurred. I like the stuff in the vein as Dougram and Patlabor, and the Destroids from Macross. These days, asides from a few aesthetic similarities, it's all super robots.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Were there any other subs besides (G_P)?</br>  <br> Dougram <br>There's something about robutts that jump three kilometres into the air.</br></br>  <br><br>Why can't I like both?</br></br>  <br>Gotta go supes.<br><br><br>That's interesting. In my mind, most shows in recent memory have been leaning more toward Real than Super. I guess things really have been blurred, as you said.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Contrary to popular belief, having a preference of one does not equal dislike or dismissal of the other.</br>  <br>Super mecha, because they're super.</br>  <br>I prefer my mecha to look more like war machines than guys in suits</br>  <br>True, when something as archetypically "super robot" as Getter Robo seems more real than the Newtype nonsense from Unicorn you can't really distinct one from the other.</br>  <br>Super Robot disguised as Real Robot</br>  <br><br>The reason I liked a lot of the older Gundam shows like 08th MS team is because there weren't many super flashy super robot things. The second build fighters just went way too far with their super robos and to me it was a disaster.</br></br>  <br>Both are entertaining, but I think Real Robot usually makes for a more entertaining show.</br>  I'd kill for a show that does hard sci fi.<br><br>Like, just fuck my shit up spending ten minutes showing me the inner workings of the machines.<br><br>Fill me up with glorious mechanism porn and people randomly entering long monologues about battle techniques and strategies that utilize the mecha's form and functions to its highest capacity.<br><br>Drown me in the delicious nectar of science or at least fantasy that has good established rules for how things work.<br><br>Damn I wish I could find another series like Hunter x Hunter where they spend half the battle explaining how a certain nen works.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Both have their merits.</br>  <br>Deez niggas</br>  <br>If the work in question is meant to be taken more literally and is dramatic, then Real. Example, Gundam 8th MS Team.<br>If the work in question is more metaphorical/symbolic and is more philosophical, I say Super. Example, Big O or Evangelion.</br></br>  I actually tend to like it most when super and real got all meta with eachother. Stuff like Dai Guard or Eva where it looks like one but plays out more like the other.  Real Mecha. It's entertaining to watch all the cannon fodder pilots go puchi-puchi.  <br><br>Relatively fragile joints and high center-of-gravity will never make sense to a /k/ purist (except maybe for small mecha for urban combat that are basically powersuited infantry). They sure look tacti-cool, though.</br></br>  <br>After the Nam Arc, I lost interest.</br>  <br>I'm still mad about the wasted potential of that laser mech.</br>  <br><br>To some degree, "Real" and "Super" mecha are relative. In the Aldnoah universe, the Martian kataphrakts are pretty much on the border of "Super" when compared with the Earth machines, yet they'd probably not stand out if injected into some of the series with more high-powered "Real" mechas.</br></br>  Only real option.  <br> Not R2 Powered <br> Not R3 Powered <br><br>Yeah, enjoy your fifteen seconds of Super Robot before you blew yourself up.</br></br></br></br>  Both can be lots of fun but I'm more a fan of real  <br>Both</br>  Best Gundam<br>Best Pilot<br><br>Finally a pilot without any stupid things holding him back</br></br></br>  <br>Setsuna go back to bed</br>  <br>Oh fine, you whiner.</br>    Translations fucking when?

Did anyone here really like this show and feel fairly sad that there's practically no chance of a season three happening? I'm actually not that into anime, so I stumbled upon this show pretty recently (long after the peak of its popularity) and found I really liked it for whatever reason. I actually read the rest of the manga and now I'm pretty sad that the anime isn't continuing past season 2. I've watched a bit of the spin-off, and disregarding the question of whether the spin-off is good or not, it just isn't remotely the same show.  <br> Did anyone here really like this show and feel fairly sad that there's practically no chance of a season three happening? <br>Nope.

I thought it was really good, but I'm still pretty curious about the Haibane and they didn't really explain much about the town or why humans could live with the Haibane or what the town was.  Was it purgatory?  Anyone have any deeper explanations?  Is it immoral for humans to fuck haibanes?  Why is he so perfect?  <br>The only perfect boy is burn victim Shirou.</br></blockquote>]
