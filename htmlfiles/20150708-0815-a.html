[ Gran Torino will make a man out of you yet anon.  Could One-Punch Man beat All-Might?  I don't think there's enough of this out yet to have an active and vibrant discussion outside of a new chapter.  <br>Of course.</br>  <br>  One-Punch Man was the first wielder of "One for All" Quirk </br>  I love when Shonen Manga are at that point where they haven't devolved into a shambling corpse force to keep staggering on due to popularity.  <br>Momo is really fat huh</br>  <br> dat invisigirl <br><br>delicious slut</br></br></br>  <br><br>Holy mother of all thickness.</br></br>  <br>When every girl is best girl... no one will be.</br>    <br>Pretty sure they stated it actually get stronger with each user.</br>  So is she supposed to be topless, but they just can't draw the nipples?    <br>Really? She looks rather muscular to me.</br>  <br> implying Deku isn't best girl </br>  <br>It's mentioned a couple of times she's wearing some kind of sheer tights-like top.</br>  <br>It's been explained several fucking times. Get off this board and keep to tumblr until you acquire basic fucking reading comprehension.</br>      <br>Naw she's certainly flabby. It's needed for her quirk after all.</br>    <br><br>if that's tight we should see more, though</br></br>  <br><br>I didn't catch this when reading it.<br><br>I thought her quirk might be censorship.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pasties.<br><br>Apparently her costume material is so thin so she can rip it when she needs to activate her powers.</br></br></br>  <br>what chapter is this explained in?</br>    <br>It was in her biography corner in an extra.<br>It also explained that she was originally supposed to be Deku and co.'s homeroom teacher but her character didn't fit what was needed so she was switched out with Aizawa.</br></br>  <br>Nah, dude. She's toned. You can see a hint of abs and vagina bones there. It's just that every girl looks pretty stocky in his style.</br>  <br>God, I hate that hair so much. It looks like she's going SSJ any minute now.</br>  <br><br> no male swimsuits </br></br>  <br>They'll just all wear swimming trunks.<br><br>Maybe Iida in a speedo.</br></br></br>    <br><br> Iida in speedos <br><br>Works for me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Who wants to oggle boys anyway?<br><br>(damn! can't find that pic of the guys wearing cheerleader outfits)</br></br></br>    <br>Why every girl is a best?</br>    <br>Huh.<br><br>I just started imagining  Momo having sex and suddenly creating sex toys and condoms from her body </br></br></br>  <br>Do you have the Momo twitter pic?</br>      <br>Why does momo always look spaced out or depressed when she isn't the center of attention?<br><br> Is she a sociopath? </br></br></br>  <br>She's always deep in thought over-analyzing everything.</br>  <br>Danke</br>  <br>So she's fem-Deku.</br>  <br><br>thinking about molecular structures</br></br>  <br>She seems to be really down on herself in general.</br>  <br>Anyways here is the colored one</br>  <br><br>I think Horikoshi has said that she puts a bunch of pressure on herself because her quirk is theoretically ridiculously good. Her and Todoroki are the only two students who didn't have to take the entrance exam to get into Yuuei.</br></br>  So it completes a full year of serialization this week or the next?  This series is so comfy to read on a weekly basis.  <br><br>She just needs some grape dick to cheer her up.</br></br>  <br>having to understand how something is made in order to give it form means a lot of studying and remembering, maybe constantly focusing on how to create things useful for every scenario is her way of dedicating herself to become a great heroine.</br>  Asui has shit tier swimsuit, dropping the serie right now  <br>Dem hips</br>  <br><br>Tsuyu will never give up the goods because she's old fashioned and dresses like a fucking quaker for some reason</br></br>  <br>I love how thick the girls are in this, much better than the likes of Oda's shitty pencil-waist samefaced girls.<br><br><br>She is a frog.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that the only thing we got?</br>  <br>Shit, anyone know the artist for the pic? I came up empty handed</br>  <br>sweet lord those bodies.</br>  So? How did Madhouse do? Is Papa Bones pleased or disappointed?  <br>Fucking disappointed.</br>  <br>Fucking incredible.</br>  <br>it was maah maah</br>  <br><br>AOTY</br></br>  <br>A mix.</br>  Is skeletor the only human trapped inside the game?  <br>Best Madhouse masterpiece since Mahou Sensou</br>  <br>We just dont know</br>  <br>Hes not in a game.</br>  <br>Go to the overlord wiki, and type adventurer. <br>There's an all female guild and a princess.</br></br>  Oremonogatari<br>Overlord<br>Onepunchman<br>What is it with Madhouse and series that start with O?</br></br></br>  WHERE'S THE FUCKING TORRENT   mc has now no penis <br> only friends are npc's made by team mates <br><br>i didnt ask for a lonely skeletal</br></br></br>  SUBS WHEN?  <br>10 mins.</br>  <br>Learn to google, it's already subbed.<br>It's been an hour already.</br></br>  <br>Already subbed retard.</br>  <br>Fuck, that looks horrible.</br>  <br>A stream on a stream, nice one faggot.</br>  <br>Not like anime looks much better. Still QUALITY, blury image and toxic colors.</br>  <br>Oh, you're one of those who need the weekly "Why streaming is shit" thread, huh? Or do you have simply bad eyes?</br>  <br>I watched both stream and raws retard.</br>  Are you ready to see Papa Bones resurrect into a fucboy after he dies to Shalltear?  Does anyone still have the link for the full op?  <br>its litterally worst show along side Chaos Dragon in terms of animation and visuals</br>  <br>Blue Rose isn't from Yggdrasil is it?</br>  <br>You again. It's been a while huh?</br>  <br>Pls, no.</br>  <br> implying Ohys-Raws is anywhere good </br>  <br>Wait I've never seen this, who is that? Rubedo? Lastborn?</br>  <br> Chaos Dragon <br> bad <br>Nice meme<br>NNB is worse</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ainz</br>  <br> thinking any quality source will improve the animation and lack there of and QUALITY </br>  <br><br>its fake</br></br>  <br>At least NNB does not have Nintendo 64 CGI dragons.</br>  <br>And not even believable, so-bin's random art from the blog.</br>  Well, at least there's a legitimate reason for people to jump on the "Oh, it's a trapped-in-a-game-world-like-SAO" bandwagon. That is, until next week when Sebas explains what the hell's going on.  <br>it's morely a Cross between Log Horizon and RE:monster than being like SAO</br>  <br>Who cares about that when NNB is boring as fuck?<br>CD is at least fun and entertaining, unlinke NNB, and CGI dragons don't bother me in the least, so try again, moeshitter</br></br>  <br>Well technically it could still be trapped in a game world, but unlike SAO it would mean Ainz is also just a copy of his real mind and programmed to believe he has senses and shit when it's all just data.</br>  <br>Outside of being a monster it's nothing like Re:Monster. Ainz starts with everything, Rou starts with barely anything. Rou however has the ability to gain everything, while Ainz can't even learn martial arts.</br>  Waiting for HS to rip it.  <br>For them first letter is never the same</br>  <br>apart from the first battle scene, I think it was great. Cant wait for more. Faithful to the ln and didnt feel as rushed as the manga.</br>  <br> death nOte <br> Okaiji <br><br>i think you are onto something anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>translation: battle scene was horrible, talking heads was more tolerable as long no one moved, pacing is shit - stretched the intro worse than manga and most episode being exposition.</br>  <br>not posting superior version</br>  <br>powerful ex-human monster leads others against all challenges in an RPG-like world.<br>sure Ainz isn't starting at lvl 1 and is a mage rather than a Fighter, but the the parallels are there.</br></br>  <br>cant deny that. I hated that fucking battle scene. It would have been better if there wasnt one. If they wanted to start with a battle scene, it had to be glorious.</br>  <br>that right there would be a hilarious outcome for Ainz</br>  Can't find the subs on Nyaa, are they only on Funimation/another streaming site for now?  <br>So, how many eps are we getting?<br>also does anyone have the full op?</br></br>  Is the light novel good?  <br>6 BD's so 12-13 eps usual disc jewing practice. It would be a miracle against nip jewing senses to do 2 cour season as 6x 4ep discs. Usually 2 cour seasons are 8 discs on average. 10-12 when they think they can easily jew it.</br>  <br>Konno Light novel is Sugoi!</br>  <br>Yeah, HS said it will be delayed for a few hours.</br>  <br>What do you think? Better than both anime and manga.</br>  <br>Yes although the translation is funny sometimes. But better than nothing.</br>  <br> 60 bucks for 2 eps <br>I will never understand.</br></br>  <br> light novel <br> good <br>If you consider the fact that most light novels are garbage, then this is slightly less garbage than a lot. Still bad by normal standards, but not bottom of the barrel.</br></br></br>  <br><br>To actually explain what this guy said, a part of YGGDRASIL was brought with him when he was transported to a different fantasy world. The game mechanics still work for him and his guild (like having an inventory), although I doubt that, that's a part of the natural order of the world he's been transported to.<br><br>As for there being other players,  others have appeared before him and made big waves which have shaped the world's history. Who knows if there are any other players currently living in the same time period as Ainz, though. </br></br></br></br>  Chances of this being more than 1 cour?  <br>Zero.</br>  <br> most light novels are garbage <br>Well, there are some good light novels like ___________ and _______________. Of course you can't forget ______________.</br></br>  <br>That wasn't what I meant, but I see your point. However the parallels you pointed out are all kind of skewed and not too similar.<br><br>Rou is climbing his way up the ladder of the world. Ainz is basically just trying to keep his place on the top of that ladder. <br><br>If you can make parallels to Re:Monster then it's no different with The New Gate where Shin is the strongest and leads his npc supporters who are also the strongest among the world to do silly shit.<br><br>The only strong similarity between Ainz and Rou is both are aiming for World Domination, and the former isn't whole hearted nor planned for it while the other is taking it as natural almost.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> _______________ <br>Oh, man. I love _______________</br></br>  <br>all you need is kill</br>  <br>Most likely, the 8 kings are said to have reincarnated so they are most likely grinding levels and shit secretly since they are disbanded.<br><br>Fluder's lifespan alone pretty much proves you don't need to give a shit about dying of old age so long as your level is high, and the 8 kings are hinted at being former max levels as well.</br></br></br>  <br>Fate/Zero and Kara no Kyoukai.</br>  <br><br><br>Whom to believe?</br></br></br>  Other players probably used world items and that is reason MC guild cant learn martial arts.  <br> Overlord  <br>Never heard of this before, but it looks promising. I trust the manga is good as well?</br></br>  <br>That's Narbel you retard</br>  <br>Manga skips alot of stuff so while it seems to look great to anyone that reads it they're really missing out on the LN which is even better by far.</br>  <br>Glorious. Papa Bones satisfied completely.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127734305 <br>Why do you keep calling it a VN?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127734305 <br> VN <br>Written by Nasu right?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127734305 <br> original source material <br>Does the manga differ to the point of being important? No spoilers please.</br></br>  <br>Watch it and find out.</br>  <br>no, its the same. Its just too rushed. Everything happens too fast.</br>  <br>Manga cuts out shitload of character related information and dialogue. Otherwise it's passable.</br>  <br>That sucks since I probably won't see the VN unless its on steam or something.</br>  <br>it's a ln, anon misspelled</br>  <br> steam <br>kek</br></br>  <br> Baccano<br>Durarara</br></br>  <br>LN*, some anon keeps typoing it.</br>  <br>which is why its the superior version retard</br>  We should keep a list of all the sins these episodes commit.  <br>Like higurashi? it recently got a steam release.</br>  <br>subs when?</br>  <br> LN's on Steam <br><br>This will be a new breakthrough.</br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't paying attention.</br>  WHERE ARE THE FUCKING SUBS  <br>It's out. HS  480p </br>  <br>...its not a VN...</br>  <br><br><br><br>http://www.gogoanime.com/overlord-e<wbr>pisode-1</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>720p out too.</br>  <br>I have realized that.</br>  <br>if they put some buttons and bg music I think they might make it lol</br>   That shitty fight at the beginning <br> Spending too much time on Albedo's Albedos <br> No golem summoning <br> No Key of Solomon <br> No dialogue between guardians <br><br>God dammit Madhouse.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So it is. 1080 now too. GO GO GO</br>  <br> gogo </br>  <br> Spending too much time on Albedo's Albedos <br>10/10 episode.</br></br>  It makes me sad knowing that the anime will ultimately kill the LN translations like it always happens.  is hs release censored?  <br>There isn't any fanservice except skeleton groping tits and that is done below the edge of the screen. She is bouncy as fuck though.</br>  <br>The anime will end before it catches up with the translation.</br>  Maruyama and so-bin did have a hand in the production right?<br><br>RIGHT?</br></br>  <br>does the hs release show it fully?</br>  So, is it good or just another Sword Art Online clone?  <br>No, its good LN ruined by Badhouse.</br>  <br> it's morely a Cross between Log Horizon and RE:monster than being like SAO <br><br>Except that in Overlord, the MC actually owns all that gold in Log Horizon's game treasury and the MC owns a nearly uncountable number of great magic items and has incomparable skills just as his minions also have more powers than anyone else in the world.<br><br>This is the first anime in decades to start out the MC so overpowered and wealthy and with so many followers and advantages. It's a real self-insert gary stu fantasy particularly since the MC is allowed to and does behave in evil fashion. Ethics and the sense of "good" behaviour are not part of his vocabulary. If he does "good" things it is out of convenience for future plans.</br></br></br></br></br>   Madhouse <br>There goes any hope of ever having a second season.<br>Prepare for shitty anime original ending.</br></br>  <br> good LN <br>So nothing of value then?</br></br>  <br>that's not for sure. From the OP it seems it at least reaches vol 4.</br>  <br>Yes, but the translations always stop after a short boost when the anime is over.</br>  Ehh, just noticed that the Opening also shows scenes from 5th and 6th volumes. Sebas in capital and Demiurge (without Black Knight next to him). + Lizardbros and Cocytus fighting with multiple weapons.<br><br>All the wrong gear too, so I damn hope those are teasers for OP only.</br></br>  autotune aside I kinda liked the OP.   download TerribleSubs <br> first 40 seconds of Company logos <br> first second after shows the text "massive online multiplayer blablabla" <br> hardsubs <br>I stopped the download.</br></br></br></br>   Yes.<br> No.<br> Maybe. <br> I don't know.<br> Can you repeat the question?<br><br> Sasuga /a/. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably, since they don't do shit in the first three volumes.<br><br>I think it'll end with Shalltear fight.</br></br></br>  The camera panning is hurting my eyes its so fucking choppy.  <br>another SAO crap.<br> DROPPED </br></br>  <br>Vampire Hunter D, I suppose...<br>Though that's probably considered low tier around here.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, we'll see how the first volume pans out, if it takes 3 or even 4 eps, they wouldn't have enough room to do 4+ volumes. Unless they want to totally butcher the pacing.</br>  <br> It makes me sad knowing that the anime will ultimately kill the LN translations like it always happens. <br><br>First of all, the light novel is very far ahead. There is enough LN material for many cours already.<br><br>Second, this anime is by MadHouse so it will only get one season. Since OverLord is announced for only one cours for its first season, that means the anime is done at 13 episodes. Therefore, it will never catch up to the LN.<br><br><br> &gt;Spending too much time on Albedo's Albedos <br>Albedo and Narberal have character goods sales potential, so of course the anime will show them off. The merchandisers are bound to be on the production committee for this type of LN conversion to anime. Thus, the anime plot will be influenced by what the merchandisers need in order to promote and sell products.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  did anyone who watched the at-x raw notice anything different in the horriblesubs release? any scene missing or blackened/blurred?  <br>You don't understand, anon. After the anime is over, the translations will surely slow down a lot. It always happens, it's inevitable.</br>  <br>Yeah that's what you get for watching FuniShit.</br>  Poor One Punch Man fans. This is demonstration of what awaits you.  <br> The camera panning is hurting my eyes its so fucking choppy. <br><br>In other words, you'd like to have 100% CGI which reduces the chop from panning fast. Of course, that means you have the small subtle chop all the time of certain types of movements (and essentially no chop from some types of movements).</br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of merchandise<br><br>Lizardbros with real kung fu grip when</br></br></br>  <br>Why would it be?</br>  <br><br><br>Kino's Journey, Boogiepop Phantom, Spice and Wolf, and bam, all the decent ones named, at least out of the ones people here generally know about.</br></br></br>  Wait what ? How can they anime it when there are so few chapters ?  <br>Nah, there's no motion/panning judder in at-x raw, it's funishit fucking their shit up again. And that's what we get from Horrible rips.</br>  <br> Reading butchered manga from a longer source and even prior start test on web. <br> Believing that the manga is the original. <br><br>You don't visit Papa Bones threads often do you?</br></br></br></br>  <br> You don't understand, anon. After the anime is over, the translations will surely slow down a lot. It always happens, it's inevitable. <br><br>Even without an anime, translations slow down over time as the TL or staff get tired or older or graduate from school and move on with their lives. You have been spoiled in the cases where the translation was started by graduates who were blessed by good financial position and friends to help them or they already had level 2 skills. You should also exclude those fast and long translations done for profit. One fan site has over 10 million views per month and a slew of donations, so of course it keeps churning out the material so as long as the donation money keeps coming in.</br></br></br>  <br> liking Badhouse <br>Bet you liked Parasyte too</br></br>  SEMEN DEMON  <br>Fuck off back to &gt;&gt;&gt;/ln/<br><br>Oh wait... you dont even have own board HAHAHAHA. /a/ is anime and MANGO</br></br></br>  <br>I bet you didn't like it.</br>  <br> Wait what ? How can they anime it when there are so few chapters ? <br><br>There are very many chapters published in the original language. Do not assume the number of english translated chapters is anywhere close to the number of original language chapters already published. Translation is far behind....</br></br></br>  <br>So, what is your point?<br>I just stated the fact that LN translations always stall after the anime is over, even when they started before the anime, e.g. Maoyuu or Sakurasou.</br></br>  <br>No need to be so hurt, just report the evil trespassers for violating you and it'll all be well.</br>  <br>dat ed, my penis.<br>http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>x299p_overlord-ed_music</wbr></br></br>  <br>You're retarded, the manga is already caught up.<br><br>Also, lurk the fuck more.</br></br></br>  <br> Mahou Sensou <br>Thanks for letting me know to avoid this shit</br></br>  <br> ... </br>     another "MC is sent into a video game world" <br>Dear god, how many more of this shit can they produce before people are bored of it ?</br>  <br>They won't stop until  you stop being a faggot. </br>  That Mare landing and skirt tug with his running animation. Oh dear japan, why, I will resist to the bitter end.  <br>I don't know, how many of "4 cute girls in a club doing cute shit" can they produce?</br>  Are we really stuck with Funishit?  <br>Anon pls.  we're still not done with magic sword highschool harem ln adaptions  :^)</br>  <br>And all of those read even more like a pilots's pre-flight checklist for a cessna.</br>  <br>Its new Sword and Sorcerry. The normal litterature is now infested by it as well.</br>    <br> data "animation" <br>They even managed the static Papa Bones to look cropped and out of place</br></br>  <br>boku no pico</br>  <br>France have no simulcast for it and if nobody OCR FUNi subs, we won't have the show translated.</br>  If it really is 13 eps im really worried.<br>Op had not only Shalltear in her armor but Cocytus agaisnt the lizards, that would make it volumes 1-4 in one cour.</br>  <br>this looks like shit</br>  wasn't this shorter than the first chapter of the manga?  The ED vocalist's voice sounds like LiSA's.  <br>This is not Charlotte</br>  <br>she's pretty cute, is she apart of the harem?</br>  Is it only me or is the HS episode have fucking terrible panning?  <br>Reminder that it's okay in raws.</br>  <br>Face needs a little work, but man. Mare's looking pretty hot.</br>  <br> she </br>  <br> she </br>  <br>They gave us that fight in the beginning in exchange for dialogue at the end.<br><br>Bad trade if you ask me.</br></br></br>  <br>God, this sucks. It's in times like this that I regret not knowing moon.</br>  <br>Both twins are females.</br>  I wish Hakomari got an adaptation instead of this.  <br>but Hakomari is garbage</br>  <br>now you're just being deluded anon.</br>  <br>Why do you lie on the internet, anon?</br>  So this is pretty much Log Horizon with spooky skelly Shiroe.  <br>I might translate it as I already done Gangsta and Ushio and Tora but it'll need me some motivation. If I pull an all-nighter then it might be up for tomorrow before 9a.m.<br>I'll see.</br></br>  <br><br>Every thread. Just watching the first episode from beginning to end would clear up all these incorrect assumptions, you know.</br></br>  The OP and ED were great.  <br>She is not your waifu, she is a ctulhu abomination!</br>  <br>Yes it is like LogHorizon but with good writing.Now fuck off.</br>  <br>That's Shalltear anon, we're still not sure what Albedo's true form is.</br>    <br>Please do it anon, I'll love you forever. I can't stand funi.</br>  <br>to be honest, first ep is very similar to Log Horizon's. except skelly is alone</br>  Why is she so creepy? The yandere vibes are so strong.  <br> He's the boy. <br> Cuter than her sister. <br>EVERY FUCKING TIME.<br><br>I thought it was okay I mean if its just NPC's that are still around and not other players I can't see it being decent.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this new season of Bleach?</br>  <br>If Shalltear is to be believed, her true form is a gorilla.</br>  <br>She is some sort of Gorilla monster, /a/non. We already went through it. The only ones who are not abominations are probably some of the maids and the elves.</br>  <br>that could just be a normal insult she throws around at Albedo, besides a gorilla would be a pit plain.</br>  <br>Best ED of the season.</br>  <br><br>Don't troll me /a/nons.</br></br>  <br><br>Pls go, Shalltear.</br></br>  Did an scene of Cocytus fighting the lizards appear in the OP?<br> Are we getting that volume animated?</br>  <br>He's a skirt wearing determined man, who would rape a female to produce offspring if Mobonga ordered it.</br>  <br>Truly. Well they could sneak it back in next ep's intro before Sebas arrives, but I doubt it.</br>  Is this going to mean more interest in the LN and possibly faster translations?<br><br> please </br></br>   draw a girl <br> call it a boy <br><br> draw a boy <br> call it a girl <br><br>Why is this allowed?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends on how it is made. Here is an exemple of a simple Gorilla zombie, so-bin is 100 times better so expect some ctulhu abomination.</br>  <br>Because of that one line in her description.</br>  <br>She wants skeleton bone</br>  Does the snake girl even have a vagina? like how the fuck do you fuck any of these monster girls? if you cant waht s the point of being around them?  <br>because it creates balance man.</br>  <br>It also had Sebas in capital and Demiurge playing the villain with him from 5/6 vol. And all in wrong gear, Cocytus and Ainz too with Shalltear.</br>   funishit <br>When they will die? Somebody has to stop them until they taken over everything.</br>  <br>wait which one of them are we talking about here?</br>  <br> So is this going to be two cour or are they just teasng LNfags?</br>  Someone asked if Sebas had a stats page last thread.  <br>Before this, you should ask if the Lich has a dick.</br>  <br> Solution's total level is 57 <br>isn't that a lot higher then most of the maids?</br></br>  <br> Non negative <br>Sebas is the hero we need.</br></br>  <br>Madhouse is hit and miss. I wasn't too happy to see them working on OPM because it's really hard to predict if that means it'll be good or bad. It's 50-50.</br>  <br>Hopefully just teasing after running out of ideas for OP. I damn hope so. 2 cour is too far-fetched with the announced 6 BD volumes and cramming all 6 volumes into 13 episodes would be lunacy.</br>  Wait, dont his real life body need water, sleep or food?  <br>She didn't call him a gorilla, right?<br><br>Shalltear was called a lamprey and Albedo was called some kind of starfish. That's what I remember from the LN translation.</br></br></br>  <br>I doubt it. They're the last defense before the throne. Sebas himself is 100</br>  <br>Isn't cocytus positive too?</br>  <br> skelly bones is his real body now </br>  <br>Supposedly some stuff was lost during the conversion from japanese to chinese.</br>  <br> but they aint in a video gam worl they really are in middle earth just everything still works like a vid gam so its different see that means that vid gam world is rel world Anime A+ you just have shit taste IIRC troll trying to turn /a/ into a meme board. <br><br>Log Horizon fans need to get out, they're worse than any other fanbase on this board.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah but ainz said that the maid's aren't actually good for that. if someone makes it past the 8th then it's basically gg no rz for team Nazarick</br>  <br>If we take that the mind defines who we are, then his old body is just a shell now and the floating skeletal parts is his real body.</br>  <br> His real body doesn't need anything of that,  since skeletons don't need to drink sleep or eat. </br>  <br> implying anyone could even make it past the first floor </br>  <br> but with good writing <br><br>Try again, hog.</br></br></br>  <br>You've had a big misunderstanding. It's not that they aren't strong in their own right. It's that Victim's floor is their strongest defense. If a raid party managed to get past that, they're strong enough to get past Sebas and the Pleiades.</br>  <br>Mr. Bones is still there you fool.<br><br> If his old guild was still good, there be 41 niggas just like him standing in the throne room. </br></br></br>  Oh and isn't skeletons considered as "gore" in china? this would never pass there. We joke about people skelingtons being them spooky shiiit.<br><br>I cant believe people think of them as scary though, no matter how you try to portray them.</br></br>  <br> he's a skeleton. skeletons dont need to drink, sleep, or eat. </br>  <br>there was that one 1.5k zerg rush</br>  <br> They made it up to the 8th floor I think and then died to the holy magic fetus.</br>  <br>Huh, what's this from?

Will redo once it airs on a different channel.  <br>How can you master the mind without mastering the body as well?</br>  <br>Based.</br>  <br>At least Madhouse understands the people's needs.</br>  I do love the dissonance between Momonga's normal (and pathetic) human voice, with which he still thinks, and his deeper lich voice whenever he talks once he was transported to the fantasy world.  <br>The arms peddler manga.<br><br>Altough there is one scene I forgot why the female main character did it, its extremely disturbing and makes her into a fucking cunt.</br></br></br>  <br>Did they even make it? Kind of looks like so-bin's art style.</br>  <br>Noice.</br>  <br>They added it int. Director asked him to make it.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure that Madhouse just had so-bin do the art for the ED.</br>  <br> Succubus blood </br>  <br>Kiba no Tabishounin, huh? Might read it (though the last update seems to be December, last year). What would you say is good about it?</br>   Tfw no busty servant will ask if you want to sex her right in the throne room   <br><br>Cute design wasted on a trap, blah.

I did not ask for these feels.  It's a decent first episode, i hope the death knight battle goes as described in the LN, gory and hyphy as fuck  <br>They're in the real world. You didn't see his giant fucking empty meeting room?</br>   get transported to world with hot, obedient demon girls <br> be a skeleton and have no dick <br><br>This is like ultimate suffering. Reminds me of Time Enough at Last.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, they coudnt kill Marvel, also they tried multiple times. So not all hope is lost.</br>  I need pictures, pirctures of spiderma- erh, I mean, I need pictures of the characters that I can use to replace these ones with for a better wallpaper.<br><br>Also, anybody has a good Victim pic? the ones I saw in the LN so far are awful. Pandora Actor's sheet is meh and I haven't even seen Gargantua yet.<br><br>Will include them into the wallpaper as they appear, I guess, but since Gargantua hasn't appeared at all in the WN or LN (as far as i've read), it may take a while<br><br>Meanwhile, have this</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What teammates? He and the ex-npcs are the only ones there.</br>  <br>I'm going to sleep now and setting subs ripping, so if Senketsu won't rip, or anon won't translate... But I hope to hell that anon will translate, because funi subs is just shit regardless if they hardsubed or not.</br>  <br>Both of those shows suck too and all have terrible writing just like this one and you're stupid for liking it and I'm going to break the bike your dad bought for you.</br>  <br> He is searching for them or any other YGGDRASIL player that might have been sent to that world but he hasn't found anyone so far.<br> There is evidence of players showing up in that world and fucking sht up many centuries before Ainz did.</br></br>  <br>how else can we get traps then?</br>    What is wrong with the frame rates? Every now and then in some scenes it goes really slow for some reason. Is this only happening to me?  <br> the best of all mmo players in the whole entire world and the most powerful player in this mmo <br>He's a midtier scrublord with a fucked build that relied on pay to win cash items and connections, he was basically a janitor in his guild since all he did was admin stuff.</br></br>  <br>no its madhouse being shit and fucking up the pan</br>  <br> You will never be this happy </br>  <br>I thought the same, but it's not just you.</br>  Jesus christ I could listen to Yumi Hara for all eternity.  <br>Did he do it for free?</br>  <br>It's just typical Funimation being garbage. The raws were fine.</br>  <br>So it wasn't just me.</br>  <br>I loved it a lot and it has potential.<br>Fucking funamation shit though those fucking frame rate drops.<br>The raw is perfectly fine.</br></br></br>  <br>I read it mostly for the art and some character design since im an artist myself.</br>  It was ok.  Shame, this show could have been good without the awkward fanservice thrown in to appease the NEETs.  <br>No he is the best mmo player in the entire world of moo games even more than Shoero and Kirito combined into one mmo person who is the second best at playing mmos because this skeleton man is the best mmo player of all time he cannot be winned against he is the best written character in the best written show of the decade it is so good that such a great anime studio such as medhouse can make this anime an A+</br>  <br>having guilds you loved empty really do feel like shit.</br>  <br>Happens with CR and Funi. Watch raws.</br>   most powerful player in this mmo  <br>but he wasn't.The guild was pretty notorious, yes, but he had a rp/pvp build that was pretty sub optimal and needed shitloads of support. his main job was probably debuff/controll from the look of his skills</br>  <br><br>I'm getting mixed signals here. Is it Funi or Madhouse fault?</br></br>  Demiurgos best guardian.  <br> Don't even reply, it's just one autist sperging shit for the sake of shitposting.</br>  The actual story is that MC had an Dive-shock, half of his brain is fried and he is a paralized hallucinating vegetable in a hospital. He cant find any other players since there arent any - its not a game, nor real world.<br><br>Later medics attempt to recover his concious, but for him it looks like enemies attacking his hold, so he repells them repeatedly.</br></br>  <br>And only one nigga answered your call for a last get together.</br>  <br>Funi.</br>  <br>Dude just say "crow control"</br>  no he is the best mmo player of all time nobody is better than him and he plays all the video game sjust like you do he plays the dragon crown quest games and the table reference games he knows all the references to video games just like you do and he is not a player who is simple to beat because of his tricky clever writing he is the most powerful character to ever exist.  <br>Watch Funi. Watch Raw. Then decide.</br>  <br>this nigga ain't itachi tho</br>  <br>Senketsu won't rip it (https://senketsusubs.wordpress.com<wbr>/2015/06/30/senketsu-subss-summer-2<wbr>015-hardsub-ripping-plans/).<br><br>Also not only the panning are shit but also fine details (mostly text and fine lineart) are jerky, look at the credit during OP/ED</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>crowd*</br>  <br>doesn't look like it worked since he has no body left.</br>  Imagine the blowjobs.  <br>i really want an SOL about Demiurge trying to set up a human ranch outside Nazarick, I wanna see it so bad</br>  <br> implying people shitposting even know what it means </br>  <br>heh heh it'll be a "slice" of life for sure</br>  really good original anime    <br>Don't you mean bipedal sheep?</br>  <br> MAL </br>  Do NPCs suspect he is not one of them, aka not proper evil overlord Momonga, and try to rebel?  <br>Shit writing<br>Shit setting<br>Shit fanbase<br>Shit memes<br>God tier women</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>don't worry, Ainz isn't here anon, we can talk freely.</br>  <br>Why would they rebel?<br><br>Ainz-sama's word is law~</br></br></br>  <br>Funi is ruining my anime experience this season.</br>  <br> both protagonists are overpowered <br> But Shiro is shit combat-wise if he doesn't have other people by his side.</br></br>  Don't you give me your love and passion?<br>That ending, I know exactly why I've got this boner.</br>  <br>no they are real people because it is a real world it is such a clever twist because it is a real world that works and looks exactly like the mmo but it is real just like captain's log horizon he is the ultimate mmo player because that is how mmos work</br>   delicious Hara Yumi voiced character <br>The rest of the show was pretty good, but I'd pick it up for this alone.</br>  <br>nigga do you really not have anything better to do then shitpost?<br><br>like nigga just go outside nigga play some vidya nigga. nigga.</br></br></br>  <br>Albedo shouldn't you be busy?</br>   people actually pay for funi to watch this disgusting video <br><br>Really hoping for a sub group to pick this up, don't even care about memes.</br></br>  <br>no he is the best most powerful tactician mmo player he is the art of war man who knows all the tricky tricks up his sleeve and the enemys sleeve too and he will out trick them with his Hermit Purple and he wins everything because he is the mmo king master and if you disagree then you're just a nasty little shitposter</br>  <br>Nigga of mine</br>    KOTAE WA DOKO YEEEEEEEAH  <br>WITH MY SOUL<br><br>WITH MY HEART</br></br></br>  <br>I think cocytus pic should be a more general shot. If I didnt knew him, I wouldnt know wtf im looking at</br>  <br>You can't be this mentially deficient; it's been stated a number of times in this thread that Overlord was originally a light novel, which is considerably further ahead than the manga.</br>   actually want to give this a try <br> shitty funi typesetting <br><br>Oh well, it looked like fun, that other show with the superpowered family did too.</br></br></br>  <br>mentally*</br>  <br>He is as they always knew him, shit they even have memories of their makers.</br>  <br> It's actually a web novel that became a light novel with lots of shit changed that became a manga and now it has an anime adaptation.</br>  The quality of the ED seems rather dissimilar to the OP and the actual show.  <br>How very profound.</br>  Demiurge seems to be the typical traitor of the group.<br><br>Hope I'm wrong. Would love for all of them to be loyal as fuck.</br></br>  <br>checked. Too bad he  loses the game among other things </br>  <br>Because the original artist drew it. The voicework is basically the best part of the show.</br>  <br>Counted 12 faces so they could be the 13 Heroes. Nothing else comes to mind from the illustrations and already known characteristics for a gang that big. Either completely new details given by writer/so-bin or that.</br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/mnthrkjpcu.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  <br>He is extremely loyal.   The only one designed to be a Starscream was Albedo before Ainz fiddled with her settings.  </br>  <br>So he would be fucked if he didn't accidentally change it?<br>Talk about lucky.</br></br>  <br> Demiurge is loyal as fuck, it's just that he is a twisted fuck.<br> Like. Ainz talked to him about wanting to know more about the world or some shit like that and he thought he was talking about world domination and told all the other guardian that that was Ainz's goal.</br></br>   If I focus I can see my MP and recharge times <br>I thought you fags said the MMO shit would be gone</br>  <br> I will ask again then.<br> Are we getting so many volumes adaptated or are they just teasing LNfags?</br></br>  <br><br>How is being a "bitch" (in the japanese sense) related to being a traitor in any way?</br></br>  I don't know shit about the light novels, but that Cocytus dude looks like a badass. Does he ever actually get to do anything, or is he forever sidelined?  <br> That was a different thing.<br> Part of that hugeass character info that Tabula wrote and Ainz skipped included something about her wanting to kill the 41 Supreme Beings.<br> By changing that one line of her being nympho to her being madly in love with Ainz, Ainz saved his ass from getting betrayed by her.</br></br></br>  <br>It's probably some LN shit. Series would have been way better if she was a "bitch".</br>  <br>He keeps thinking of it in gaming terms, as well as corporate, because it's what he's familiar with. <br><br>Unfortunately, such technical jargon tends to contribute to his paranoia and general lack of empathy.</br></br></br>  <br> He gets a whole volume where he invades the lizardmen tribe and slaughters them all by himself.</br>  <br>Teasing, otherwise that would scream pace butchering on the level of Bantorra and Tokyo Ravens and co.</br>    <br>It's like you never read an NTR story before anon. You're too pure for this world.</br>  <br>The   traitor part wasn't in the last sentence that he changed. It was throughout the entire epic novel of a background setting that her creator wrote and Ainz just skimmed to the last sentence, because he didn't have time to read all of it.  </br>  The OP spoils quite a few things. <br><br><br>In the OP we see the Lizarmen. Seeing the sworn their loyalty to Ainz would be a nice ending too.</br></br></br>  <br> If this was 25 episodes long then it might be possible, but it's impossible to fit so much in 12-13 episodes considering how little they covered in this episode.</br>  <br>The OP also shows Demiurge playing his theatrics and Sebas in capital, which both happen after lizardbro volume. Teasing, it has to be. Right? Please.</br>  <br>Neat.</br>  <br>In the LN, Albedo wasn't a bitch,   she was a nympho (as expected as a succubus.)  </br>  <br>Well, it wasn't that bad. considering the source material I expected much worse</br>  I really enjoyed it. Ending theme was awesome, but the ending itself was boring.  <br> Like  said, it seems the adventurers show up too.</br>  This is so bad it hurts<br><br>Sasuga Badhouse.</br></br>  <br> They're the same, anon <br><br>I suspect the translator just opted for nympho to make it clear for non-japanese readers.</br></br></br>  <br> and pathetic <br>it's just an average joe's voice</br></br>  <br>Aye, and since the pre-screening event announced there will be 6 BD's, it's either 6x2ep or 6x4ep. We'll know the pacing and probable length after the anime has covered 1st volume of novels and started 2nd.<br><br>4 eps per volume, 12 and end with throne room of Ainz looking at his children from outside the group and getting all the feels and seeing his old comrades.<br><br>3 eps per volume, end it 12 and Lizardbro fealty (which would be pretty meh place to end compared to the end of 6th or 3rd volume).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So will we get to the Shalltear fight?</br>  Why does this shit have low fps at some frames  <br> 6x4ep <br>Well I know for sure this aint happening.</br></br>  <br>Same but sometimes you have to hang onto miracles.</br>  <br> Yes, it's fucking impossible for them not to animate that unless this has super slow pacing and an entire anime-original arc.</br>  <br>They are pathetic. <br><br>Which is why it's now gap moe. <br><br>I hope that whenever this gets dubbed, they would get the one who voices DEATH from the Discworld TV movies to voice Momonga whenever he talks, and then switch to a whimpy voice whenever he thinks.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Funishit.</br>  <br>Upgrade your GPU</br>  <br>Because FuniShit fucked up (and HorribleSubs ripbot can't fix that). Watch the at-x raws if you want it looking like it should.</br>  twins were the worst part of the episode  <br>And three of them were on the top 1-something</br>  <br>M8 I can run a piece of shit like ark</br>  <br> top 1-something <br> Fan Fiction </br></br>  It was pretty funny and Harami's voice is the sex.  <br> Sli 980ti <br> upgrade <br>Quad Titan X it is.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't remember the key, or golem. Mind refreshing my memory?</br>  <br>I actually thought the same when I saw him</br>  Madhouse is such shit these days. I really fear for the quality of OPM. Surely this is just a cheap adaptation their B team is doing while the A team works on OPM, right?  <br><br>Climb and the 8 fingers evil mafia.</br></br>  What was going on with the two guardians that didn't show?  <br>stop lying faggot</br>  <br> Who?</br>  <br>After leaving the Throne Room and before entering the Colosseum he went to the room before Throne Room and tested the Golem's and defence systems and if he could use items like that.</br>  <br>why're blaming madhouse for ? if you dont want to deal with shitty frame and fuck up panning acth the raws</br>  <br>I'll buy a fucking Albedo and Nar figure if it wasn't shit.</br>  <br>Hence Solomon's Key/Gate, aka Lemegeton and the defense mechanism called Lemegeton's Demon.</br>  <br>vwe've seen victim only remaining guardian is gargantua<br> some say he outclass sebas in terms of fighting power </br></br>  <br>I think they're rooted into their floor.</br>  Can some moon faggot check the skipped setting of Albedo that funishit didn't bother translating? Maybe there is something interesting in the few things anime showed.  <br> Gargantua hasn't appeared. <br><br>Didn't Ainz ride on it while he was displaying Nazarick's epic level dick to the lizardmen?</br></br></br>  <br>one is a quadmansion sized golem, and the other  is an angel fetus that is used for top defence  </br>  <br>One of them is too huge to leave his post (the one apply named Gargantua). <br>Victim is a  living nuke, and too dangerous to let roam around freely.  </br></br>  Why is this even called an anime, there's supposed to be animation, not stationary images.  <br>only confirm setting that shes a nympho and planning to kill the remaining supreme beings.  and theres no other supreme being since they didnt log in when the teleport happen </br>  <br>8+1 doesn't make 12 and none of them even look alike. Not even the gear matches.</br>  <br> What? That's what moonreaders told me.</br>  <br>Touch me was the strongest melee, another guy was the strongest magician and Tabula was a lot stronger than Ainz, who was fairly decent magic caster.<br><br>Also they were the second or third strongest guild with just 40 players at their peak. And they bought a lot of p2w stuff. Not just Ainz.</br></br></br>  <br>  Victim is a floating fetus/real angel that has to kill itself for a super spell that wiped out a entire raid of player. Garganta is essentially a automated golem.  </br>  Holy shit, this was even worse than Chaos Dragon. What's with all the shit adaptations this season?  <br>Nigga this show looks awful even without Funi's fuck ups.</br>  <br>I been asking Shaft that since the gatari series began.</br>  <br>But Chaos Dragon was great.</br>  <br>I didn't really like it until volume 3. Volume 3 was pretty good.</br>  <br>Enjoy your eye cancer.<br><br>Truly yours, Funimation.</br></br></br>  <br> Someone in this thread said someone made it to the 8th floor and got wiped. Is Victim still alive? </br>  <br>FUCK OFF</br>  <br>In the novel Momonga gimped his character for the sake of role playing, so his stats are derp.</br>  <br><br>Now, now. Chaos dragon was pure shit. That fucking MC.</br></br>  Damn, I can't stop thinking what kind of waifu would I create for myself in that kind of game.<br><br>I'm sure it would include corruption. Slow and through.</br></br>  <br> It must have been horrible being in the same server as them.<br> Imagine getting constantly PK'd by this P2W assholes.</br></br>  <br>Thanks for your low fps funimation</br>  <br>get it approved on the wiki and Ill believe you</br>  <br> corruption <br>Metzen pls go</br></br>  <br>I thought the angel foetus was a suicide bomber that gave out debuffs.</br>  <br>Victim  kills itself to apply MASSIVE Debuffs and DoTs to EVERYONE on the floor. then the guild p2ws and revives it. I think. </br>  <br>  Yes. It was when they were in the game. Victim was revived  </br>  <br>I like that one with the guy who gets summoned to a fantasy world to marry a readheaded tittymonster and just laze about in the castle.</br>  <br>Originally it was the hobby of humanoid players to PK all the demi-human and anthromorphic players all day long because humanity fuck yeah. So it was them taking up the role they were given, first banding up to be the Original Nine and then form the guild and create their own dungeon.</br>  <br>Touch me actually saved Momonga from getting constantly pk'd when he first joined due to his non-human race.<br><br>Made the guild together and momonga eventually rose to guildmaster.</br></br></br>  <br>Bet that's why the game died. Bunch of faggot p2ws running around ruining the game for everyone because not balanced for free play. World class items out of control floating everywhere.</br>  <br> A bunch of different guilds made a massive raid (I think there were like 1500 faggots) and attacked the Great Tomb of Nazarick in an attempt to put an end to Ainz Oaal Gown days of PKing.<br> They defeated Shaltear, the twins and everything in their path till they reached the 8th floor, where Victim used his suicide nuke to wipe the entire raid.<br> After that AOG revived it by paying money so he/she/it should be alive.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck that shit.<br><br> He decides not to bring any science books with him. <br> mfw </br></br></br></br>  <br>Black Scripture.. see the girly looking dude in the middle and the old woman</br>  <br>Suicides to bind all enemies to prevent escape. I don't remember any other debuffs.</br>  <br> But as of Volume 3 he is already trying to implement shit from his world since he realized he is too much of a japanese workslave to just laze around all day.</br>  <br>Opening is probably just referencing later events because... well, Cocytus doesn't do much in the first few volumes. Same with Sebas.<br><br>Plus if they get a season two, they can reuse parts of the opening. Save some cash that way.</br></br></br>  <br> trusting wikia </br>  <br>It gave every single useful debuff for PvP. From regular binds to blindness.</br>  <br>I'm not a novel/mangafag, but I enjoyed this quite a lot. Dealing with funishit is annoying, sure, but it's still better than some shows that aired so far.</br>  <br> Touch me <br> In real life, he has a beautiful wife and children. <br><br>Die. Die in a fire.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You'll learn it when more gets translated. You'll just have to wait like the wikia believing scrublord that you are.</br>  That was some serious eye cancer.  <br>name?</br>  <br> Brought a whole bunch of useless shit <br>Nope, fuck that MC. Dropped it right there.</br></br>  <br>Nah it's fine, I got enough of that already with Oda "shithead" nobunaga in Drifters. Gate also got that covered.<br>By the way I forgot the name of it, do you remember?<br><br>Is that so? I just remember their short-lived plans to make glass.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What the hell does victim even do other then talk in gibberish? They mention it taking one for the team so obviously it's a kamikaze fetus but what's it do?</br>  <br> Didn't you pay attention? Being a useful member of society was one of the requisites to join the guild.<br> Everyone there had a job, a family or both, and that's why most of them left the game too.</br></br>  <br>Chaos Dragon is probably to meta for you. Treat it like a Gintama parody episode.</br>  <br>Im still pissed about him not even bringing about a magnifying glass or a swiss army knife, to say nothing of BOOKS on stuff like medicine, biology, math, farming, chemistry, etc<br><br>Dont get me wrong, I love the LN, im just pissed at the guy who couldnt be arsed to bring along a encyclopedia</br></br></br>  Since the ED artwork was commissioned from so-bin, does that changing hair reveal anything new for her?  better subs when  <br> Thrall is a dragon now! <br> Thrall gets his own waifu! <br> Everyone else dies or goes crazy <br> Horde is evil again and Alliance is filled with furries! <br> How?

Me too.</br></br></br>  she's anorexic, right  How does /a/ feel about Inori Minase?<br>I liked her a lot as Chino in Gochiusa, and her Carol in Symphogear so far.</br>  https://seiyuuplus.wordpress.com/20<wbr>15/07/04/71-seiyuu-castings-earning<wbr>s-everything-in-between/<br><br>tl;dr being seiyuu is suck unless you're backed by big agency and good manager who can push you in the right direction.</br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br>or you suck aketagawa cock exceptionally well</br>  <br>Haven't seen Symphogear, but I think Hestia is the most breakout of a role that she'll ever have.</br>  <br>We already knew this, but it's always nice to have more detailed information about seiyuu earnings.</br>  <br>Kyoani lead role coming soon.</br>  <br>she's getting typecast too much so there's no way of assessing her talents. her RGZ role was good though.</br>  <br>Or let your manager do all the cock sucking.</br>  <br>She is jinsei</br>  <br>in any case, cocks will be sucked. sound director must be a lovely job.</br>  Ayaneru is my seiyuufu.  <br>We will never see her Kancolle cosplays.</br>  <br>So you're cucked by this guy then.</br>  <br>What is wrong with his head.</br>  <br>Get in line.</br>  <br>aww yiss</br>  <br>She's already out of Ayanerubowl.</br>  Reminder.  gotou saori is not made to be happy  Still waiting on my order.    <br>Slut.</br>  <br>We won't get to see her Shimakaze cosplay, but at least there's this.</br>  <br>She's in two shows this season!</br>  <br>She was flirting with Uchiyama Kouki quite a bit in the Charlotte radio show too.</br>  <br>She'll play Sodachi. Mark my words</br>  <br> nobody else remembers this series </br>  What is more grating, seiyuu that pretend to be alone/lonely or seiyuu that pretend to be lesbos?  <br>I have really been worried about her for the last year, she just disappeared overnight during the Christmas holidays and became spare King Records cast member #2. That context makes it a lot worse.<br><br>Last year's concert tour was Give Evidence as well. Actually taken alone I would have thought the 2014 one was just shilling that but given 2015 it becomes kind of depressing.</br></br></br>  <br> year <br>Half year. A year and a week ago she was doing 3 radio shows at once, and had just released an album and a new single It's been a really steep drop.<br><br>The weirdest part is still that her Show By Rock character from the game was recast for the anime while Sumipe stayed on.</br></br></br></br>  <br>the latter<br><br>i can imgine gotou saori to go days without speaking to a single soul.</br></br></br>  You would think Madoka would've given KitaEri's career a boost.  <br>i always believed she was basically just one step shy from being a star in the business. it's all very weird.</br>  <br>Seiyuu-dom is a bit of a mistery to me.<br>I see not-even-that-old seiyuu with both great vocal talent and personality get ignored in favor of younger faces in the industry who are inferior in both departments. Always wondering why they aren't more popular.<br>But I guess it's all about what's current on/airing, and how hard their agencies want to shill then, though.</br></br></br>  <br>it's also the price. older seiyuu automatically get more expensive, and the agency's keep pushing young and marketable (and affordable) new talent on the market. if you want to stay in business after a certain point, you need to have excellent connections and be on very good terms with key deciders in the industry.</br>  <br><br>Met her a few years back. She seemed nice.</br></br>  <br>I understand the issue with the price of veteran seiyuu but I was talking more about fan demand if anything.<br>I guess most people just don't care either way and seiyuufags are a minority.</br></br>  3DPD aside, it's refreshing to see these asian ladies still wearing skirts.  Episode 1 was amazin, my D cant handle all these boners.<br><br>OP: <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?t=50&amp;<wbr>v=Tumh8gydreE</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>ED:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=j3M<wbr>KpbGcfD4</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>Also<br> Summerfags gtfo <br> Report and enjoy the ride </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Yes.

How are the Japanese okay with this being shown on television?  <br>Little to no Judeo-Christian moral/religious influence</br>  Remove Bible thumpers, remove feminist nutjobs, enjoy freedom!  I want to convert to Islam so I can marry Kuro!  <br><br>How are you not ok with the japanese being ok with that?</br></br>  <br>I am ok with this</br>  <br>Why is the west OK with showing raging faggots and dykes on TV?</br>  WOULD YOU?  What an ugly loli  <br>Hey OP, 99% of anime (with the exception of battle shonen) airs in japan at very late hours (often after midnight). <br>Why do you think anybody would care?</br></br>  Says the more than likely American who can turn the channel and see all kinds of unspeakable violence <br><br>Sexuality is so much more acceptable than Violence.</br></br>  <br>And yet you're ok with a nigga in the presidency</br>  <br>How are there people not okay with this being posted on /a/?<br><br>The world may never know.</br></br></br>  There is that one show that focuses on little girls dancing and their mom. The kids do some slutty choreography and are barely dressed.<br>Why are the Americans okay with this show being on television?</br>  <br>Most aren't, actually.</br>  <br>Japanese TV don't care as long as nipples aren't shown.</br>  Americans have morals.  <br>It's only shown well after dark when all normal people are asleep dreaming about their next day at work. The only creeps who can possibly see it are you and me, and we're clearly okay.</br>  <br><br>Americans have the weakest moral fiber in the areas that actually matter, i.e. those that lead into helping their fellow human being.<br><br> European: What kind of barbarian would saddle someone who's already hurting from illness and injury and just experienced the scariest night of their life with a crippling debt on top of that? Of course I'm willing to pay taxes! <br> American: Why should I have to pay for that fucker? This is my money! <br><br>No concern for anyone but themselves.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They are not idiots?<br>Getting mad over something that is not real is a pretty stupid thing to do.<br><br>They even recently excluded manga and anime from materials that cold be considered like child porn sources, so that might give you an idea f how much they don't fucking care.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No we don't, we have moralfags. There's a big difference.</br>  <br>you're making europeans look stupid</br>  <br> They even recently excluded manga and anime from materials that cold be considered like child porn sources <br>Wait they did? Isn't this like pretty big or am I stupid?</br></br>  <br> Getting mad over cartoons <br>They work 16 hours a day, they barely have time to eat, you think they're gonna waste their 20 minutes of daily free time bitching about cartoons?</br></br>  <br>Not him, but are you talking shit about free healthcare?</br>  <br>We have freedom unlike you Western countries. That's why we can say "White pig go home!" in public.</br>  <br>The jews can't breach the nippon loli love folded &gt;1000 times.</br>  <br>That's cool, are the people who're being insulted allowed to talk back though? I have a feeling there'd be some bias on that front.</br>  <br>Right, that's why we give $31 billion in foreign aid every year. <br><br>We're such dick heads.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You're making yourself look stupid. Not only is this demonstrating that they don't consider themselves to be the center of the universe, it also prevents the financial problems that arise in hospital across the States and removes inefficiencies in the form of useless billionaires sucking up money at the top of the health insurance industry.<br><br>It's really funny that Bible thumpers are so anti-public healthcare. It shows that they view their religion simply as a tool of social authoritarianism to turn the world into their hugbox, rather than as a contract to always place the good of others above their own selfish desires, as Jesus would.</br></br></br></br>  <br> That's cool, are the people who're being insulted allowed to talk back though? <br>They don't. I think our country is the most freedom nation in the world but it is only for Japanese citizens and I'm proud of it. What's wrong with being xenophobic when foreigners have their own home overseas?</br></br>  <br>is this supposed to be too sexy? no nipples, so nothing "shocking".</br>  <br> most freedom nation in the world <br>Please remember that in japan adults are not allowed to view genitals.</br></br>  <br>But isn't this basically the same thing in a show actually meant for kids?<br>The only difference being you have to look a little harder to see the bottom in OP's pic.</br></br>  <br><br> &gt;most freedom nation in the world <br> no guns <br> can get jailed if someone sees you naked in your own flat <br> will most likely get jailed if someone accuses you of groping in public transportation <br> can't criticise the Emperor or the government <br><br>Yeah, no. I like Japan and the Japanese, but the country sure as fuck has issues.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We have freedom to blur genitals when we can do it.</br>  <br> What's wrong with being xenophobic when foreigners have their own home overseas? <br>Literaly nothing.</br></br>  <br><br>It's a double standard.<br><br>If you visited a western country, I don't think that you'd repeat what you just said in response to "Get out of my country, you filthy Jap monkey."<br><br>Actually, let's try that right now. Don't you have some perfectly good Japanese-speaking boards that you could be posting on? Why are you even here?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The US puts more money into social programs than most European countries have in GDP. Nobody is against helping people who come across hard times here and there but a lot of people are getting tired of their taxes paying for people who make it a habit to live off of benefits. You are completely overgeneralizing and clearly have no idea what you're talking about.</br>  <br>So you have the freedom to be allowed to not have freedom, good to know.</br>  <br> Judeo <br>Yeah no. Go fuck yourself jew. The only moral is Jesus and jesus said : let the children come to me. Jesus, like all great men, was a lolicon.</br></br>  <br> can't criticise the Emperor or the government <br>What century do you think it is?</br></br>  <br>He was also a jew.</br>  <br><br>For the Japanese or the rest of the world?</br></br>  <br> Jesus <br> not a jew <br><br>Are you kidding me? He was the jew prophet for some time before christians made him their prophet.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I don't think that you'd repeat what you just said in response to "Get out of my country, you filthy Jap monkey." <br>We actually used to get called it in UK after WWII for long time. But we have word 臥薪嘗胆 (control myself without saying anything) so we forbore it or just decide never visit there.</br></br></br>  <br>Because you are not ?<br><br>Are you gay Anon ?</br></br></br>  The majority thinks it's disturbing but they allow it.  <br/>  <br>Hey Japan, why do you hate endangered animals?</br>  <br>Thanks you, /pol/. Have a magical totally unsexy girl</br>  <br><br>And you're sidetracking into something completely different. What does public healthcare have to do with people leaching off of the system instead of working?<br><br>Also, America is a much bigger country than the European nations, both in terms of population and in terms of sheer size. Many times the size, many times the people, many times the money. In terms of percentages, we're clearly not putting as much as we need to into supporting this country. We're really a bunch of cheap, self-centered fucks living in a selfish macho fantasy land in this country. That's why we lag behind in so many areas.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Why are you even here? <br>Probably because 2chan is so fucking slow, there are 1 year differences between posts on some boards.</br></br>  <br><br>And yet, here you are on this English speaking board, clearly saying something.</br></br>  <br>Well shit. I learned something. Thank you.</br>  <br>I don't think the Chinese are endangered.</br>  Because Americans have this issue with lewds featuring kids yet they air trash on TLC and ABC Family and get away with it? A joke television has become. I blame the femenizing of FCC.  <br>Yeah that makes a lot of sense, but even though Japan is quite xenophobic, they still want to / decide to visit other countries and expect to not be harassed. Do you see the double standard?</br>  <br>Bullshit.<br><br>Mary was a jew. <br>Joseph was a jew.<br>Jesus was a jewy McJewJew</br></br></br></br></br>  That's a good question. It's creepy as fuck.  <br>Nice try, JIDF</br>  <br>I don't watch 2chan or even don't know much about anime. But I heard that GATE makes huge butthurt of weeaboos on /a/ from /int/, I'm temporary here.</br>  <br>Let's not turn this into a /pol/ thread.<br><br>Remember, a loli a day keeps the normie away.</br></br></br>  I wish fat acceptance was illegal. Ban high frutcose corn syrup too,along with hormones and other crap added in meals.  <br><br>Who cares? He's a fictional character not from Japan.</br></br>    <br>It's because americans don't consider themselves americans; They consider themselves whites, jews, republicans, blacks, rich, poor, etc. first before they consider themselves americans, and thus don't help their fellow man because they simply don't see each other as people.</br>  <br>I think the concept of freedom has corrupted everyone.</br>  <br><br>You plebs. Never trust a jpeg on the internet, even if it's png. Any argument or major rebuttal that can fit on a single image is not worth anything. Go look up the actual source then try to find credible citations that either confirm or refute it. And if it doesn't have citations that also means it's not worth anything since no one bothered. Just googling the author reveals the guy was nothing more than a nut-job with zero academic credentials.<br><br>Holy shit. You guys are gullible.</br></br></br></br>  SHUT THE FUCK UP AND POST MORE LOLIS PLEASE  <br> Benjamin Harrison Freedman (1890 – May 1984) was an American businessman, Holocaust denier, and vocal anti-Zionist. <br><br>sasuga /pol/</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Bring up an American supposedly refusing to partake in funding social programs. <br> &gt;Here's an example of why that's wrong <br> &gt; BLAH BLAH HEALTHCARE  <br><br>Social programs are not solely public healthcare. They are food stamps, housing for low income families, social security, medicare, medicaid and many other different programs. I pay almost 28% of what I make to fund these programs and I'm totally ok with that. There is nobody in this world who ENJOYS paying taxes but a vast majority understand that it's necessary. You are arguing that the US doesn't want anything to do with helping others when that's simply not the case. Citizens are tired of having their hard earned money spent on programs that encourage a lazy lifestyle with no motivation to ever get out of poverty. They are tired of funding programs that just don't seem to work or are mismanaged to all hell.<br><br>Your communistic fantasy has already been tried numerous times and it has never worked. With no motivation a country will stagnate and it will die.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm going to work my ass off to pay jew associations, immigrants and people who don't work <br> those people will vote for loli ban <br> let you no money to buy cute loli <br>No. Just no. Muricans are right<br><br>shhhh, people don't need to know.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The image is right, though. Jesus wasn't a Jew, simply because jews didn't exist back then.</br>  <br><br>Not freedom. Individuality.<br><br>America is what happens when obsession with individuality gets taken too far. Everyone becomes so self-important and self-centered that they forget how to stop and think of both the big picture and the other people around them. In the long run, this behavior winds up shooting everybody in the foot, as they wind up with broken solutions to some problems and do their best to ignore others altogether.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying holocaust is real <br>And what's wrong with being anti-zionist? Not that I'm against the genocide of thousand innocent people to give jews more land. Just asking</br></br>  <br> funding programs <br>We need to get rid of planned parenthood.what else?</br></br>  <br>I rather consider myself as ME.<br>I also consider everyone else to be worthless dirt, only to be helped out when I have something to gain.<br><br>Why everyone else isn't doing this is beyond me.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>You guys need Islam.</br></br></br>  <br> I pay almost 28% of what I make <br>Good thing you make a lot. If it wasn't the case you wouldn't be okay to pay.</br></br>  <br>Momo, pls.</br>  <br>Good thing taxes scale with your income and there are tax credits for basically everything.</br>  <br>http://www.catholic.com/quickquesti<wbr>ons/if-jesus-was-a-jew-why-are-we-c<wbr>atholic</wbr></wbr></br>  By the way, where is GATE thread? I don't see any flaming.  <br>Obviously they wren't -called- jews at the time, but it was the same general group of people who would eventually become what we know as jews.<br><br>He sure as hell wasn't a christian.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I guess that if you're going to ignore what I said in my post favor of going off on your own little tirade, continuing this conversation is pretty useless.<br><br> trying to paint it all as a package deal <br><br>Anything to not spend a dime.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> we should stop funding birth control </br>  <br>Catholic church is the worst branch of Christianity.<br>They are pro Jewish, and have a mentally ill pedophile pope.
