I want to  hold  Tomoko  tight  as we  watch anime  all night long.  <br>i hated tomoki's voice actor. the kid's in middle school why'd he sound like he's 20?</br>  The manga was good at first but the school-trip arc is really starting to drag on, and having to wait three weeks or me for only a few pages is making it worse.

I can't see it.  <br>Madoka never loved Homura and never will. Homura will die alone like she deserves. Get used to it faggot.</br>  <br>With these shitposters, can't count on it.</br>  <br>Yeah, you don't count. But go ahead and try to find any examples of that happening back in 2007.<br><br>You can quantify feelings. And it was explained how. You going "kill youself" doesn't prove it wrong.<br><br>Same for your next point as well. It was already explained how it's bad. But you just keep ignoring everything. This is the third time you've tried to side step how it's not about what anyone likes.<br><br>It's your assertion, I can't prove something that didn't happen is true. Thus you have to present evidence for your claim to prove it did happen.<br>What you fail to realize is that you again ignored everything in the post and don't understand that whether someone is mad or not is totally irrelevant. If someone is foaming at the mount with rage they are still correct if they say 2+2 is four.<br><br>Because it's obvious you don't even understand the basic idea of the posts being made. <br><br>Like. It's just sad how stupid you are. The problem is people making degrading comments about the characters. This can be done without pictures. If their intent for the art is for it to be romantic in nature then it is because the statement they as a person are making is that the characters are romantically involved. Thus degrading their feelings.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop that please.</br>  <br>Man, it sure is telling that crack shitposters are the only people ever who spam images just for the sole purpose of being contradictory.</br>   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gD<wbr>FWHD9cm-E</wbr>  [ ] <br>F/SN UBW Dub Trailer is out, what do you think?<br><br>Original for reference:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sps<wbr>eKv7jtmY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some people actually enjoy watching the detail they put into the scenes instead of reading lines of text once and a while.</br>  My ears hurt.

She would go into depression if that happened. <br>So she would get slightly down and forget about it soon? I don't think she would be depressed, depression is just being so fucked you go numb.<br><br> So after spending nearly 2 years going after a guy she won't despair? <br>She would accept it and not feel bad at all. She doesn't have an envious streak and she is a person that can handle things as she is emotionally well adjusted.<br><br> It's literally amplified when they see their best friend with 8man, <br>Friend should want friends to be happy. Sure it might be weird to be the odd one out but it will smooth over in a week or two. <br><br>  I don't know how you don't understand that anon <br>Why would it hurt Yukino/Yui to see 8man be with Yui/Yukino?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>]
