There’s absolutely nothing wrong in loving a ship because they are lesbians. It’s not like straight people are lacking in representation. But a well developed romantic bond between two intriguing female characters, who share so much screen time, mutual development and love? That’s rare, and more than enough reason to appreciate a ship like this.<br><br>Straight KumiRei would still be a well-developed relationship, but it wouldn’t have piqued my interest at all. And it would change their characters; for example: Kumiko’s overt disinterest in men, and Reina’s likely self-denial of her own lesbianism, wouldn’t very well be factors to take into consideration, were either a dude.<br><br>No, Kumiko and Reina being read as lesbians is incredibly important to me, and my shipping of it. It’s not the only reason to ship them, but I’ll happily admit that nope, I wouldn’t be this emotionally invested if it was just about some straight people, or even two gay boys - there are other series for that. This is rarer, and far more personal and relatable - obviously.<br><br>I ship them because they are both girls, and girls with such shared passion, such wonderful characterization, such wonderful interactions and such wonderful development. For being girls in love. And that is a key part for me, with a relationship this rich, this rare, and this gay.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Have the novels been translated to English?  <br> ... <br>fuck off</br></br>  <br> tumblr </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127503820 <br/>  <br>Please stop copying text from tumblr.

You wouldn't understand</br>  <br>So none of these second-years were in the band? But that's weird because everyone except for Natsuki could play before going to Kitauji.<br><br>Or that all first-years knew the second-years, but the anime didn't show? But if this is the case Kumiko wouldn't even have tried to pretend that she didn't know eupho, because they would all know.</br></br></br>  <br>Hazuki recognises that hand.</br>  That transition to being encouraged and then realising she's still mad at him.  <br>he misread what you wrote<br><br>Natsuki Mizore Yuuko and Nozomi were part of the same middle school but not the same as Kumiko, Shuuichi and Reina. I don't think anyone in the band went to the same school as them. Aoi knew Kumiko and Shuuichi from their childhood though, not sure if they went to the same middle school.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait what? Natsuki hasn't played but she did go to the their local middle school. Nozomi, Yuuko and Mizore played together in their middle school.

Trollish isn't it?</br></br>  <br>and episode 12 is there to explain to you that Reina would push Kumiko into a Japanese truck if she went near Taki again</br>  <br>I know, but why would they do it so fucking gay? I mean, you have them inches away from each other's face, the cheek touching, the voice acting, the hand touching. Kumiko's fucking face.<br>For what<br>damn<br>purpose</br></br></br></br>  why does Taki use his hands instead of a baton?  <br>Only amateurs use batons.</br>  <br><br> For what damn purpose <br><br>Because bait.</br></br></br></br>  Was Hazuki thinking of the impasse between Shuuichi and Kumiko or that she still likes him, here?  <br>What the-<br>I live in Peru!<br>Where the fuck are those pictures from, causa?<br>I don´t remember there being any events these past season, mierda.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Has bait ever been this blunt in Kyoani?

I always thought Reina reacted like that because Kumiko spent time with someone else when she wasn't doing very well instead of going to Reina.</br>  <br>Hands are usually use for choirs.

And as each conductor is called up, girls are heard screaming "I LOVE YOU SENSEI". When Taki sensei is called up, Reina screams from the audience "I love you Taki sensei" (Taki sensei, suki desu!). After which Reina buries her face in her hands and starts crying because she instantly regrets her decision. Kumiko tells her it's fine, it didn't even sound like a confession since everyone else was doing it. Then Ribbon comes and thanks Reina for saying what she did because all the girls wanted to say it together but nobody was brave enough. So that's why it sounded like a sign of respect to Taki sensei. Because screaming it from the audience made her sound like a fangirl, not an actual confession. Now what happens after Nationals is that Taki sensei confronts Reina about it, telling her "thank you for cheering me on". At which point Reina then gives a REAL confession, "I love you Taki sensei. The reason why I came here was just for you. I really, truly love you". Taki sensei's response to this one though is very different, as far as using an idiomatic expression. So his response to this is "To be told that as a teacher is more than I deserve, thank you" (literally "I am favored by fortune"). So he establishes in his own Taki sensei way that he and Reina are teacher and student. And then Reina is still extremely happy that she got to confess and runs off to the bathroom because she probably wet herself or something. Asuka and Kumiko are watching the entire thing and are confused at what just happened, not entirely sure if Sensei was serious or not but one of the things in this series is that nobody really knows what Taki sensei is thinking.   fucking phenomenal writing turning Ribbons into one of the best girls    <br>How did she fit that thing in her pocket?</br>  <br>   The reason why I came here was just for you. I really, truly love you </br>  <br> thanks </br>  <br>   is "To be told that as a teacher is more than I deserve, thank you" (literally "I am favored by fortune"). So he establishes in his own Taki sensei way that he and Reina are teacher and student.<br/> <br>I CALL BULLSHIT ON THAT UNTIL SOMEONE TELLS ME EXACTLY WHAT HE FUCKING SAID</br></br>  <br>She was always one of the best girls</br>    just saw the episode.

Reina gives Shuuichi two tickets and tells her to invite Kumiko. And Reina dresses up like the girl from the Grudge and then scares Kumiko so hard that she grabs Shuuichi by the arm and runs out as fast as she can.<br><br>Yuuko visits the crepe cafe and Natsuki gives her a "special service" strawberry crepe, which involves putting so much cream on top that Yuuko can't see even see the crepe. Yuuko still eats the entire thing because she didn't want to lose to Natsuki while Natsuki is just being smug the entire time about it. Mizore sees Yuuko and Natsuko doing this, and Mizore asks Nozomi if she wants a special service crepe too but Nozomi says she's fine with a normal crepe.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Surprisingly mature on both ends.</br>  <br>You took too long.

As a franchise and anime, obviously Fate is bigger, but from anything I've seen, SAO is much more popular as a LN. Granted I've never seen any of the sales numbers for any of TM's LNs. They never seem to make the charts, or just aren't on them?<br><br>In terms of global appeal, I believe SAO is more popular.</br></br></br>   REEN <br><br>Yeah this will be great.</br></br>  <br>How do you go from that to this, I blame the director.</br>   Dub Shirou is Dub Eren is Dub Kirito <br><br>DROPPED</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=eRw<wbr>y1Nu5Q2I</wbr>  [ ]</br>   REEN <br> Archer not Liam O'Brian <br>DISGUSTING</br></br>  <br>Type Moon's never really had any super mainstream LNs other than Fate/Zero.</br>  <br>Not bad for a dub.

Getting rid of Liam was the worst move. Rin's voice sounds like a 50 year old. Only redeeming character is Kirei and he sounds very good.  <br>Lancer's 1 line was great too.</br>  Zero was better.<br><br>Crispin and Mercer sexy voicing against each other beats the faggot who voices every teenage male MC nowadays. And they got the same voice for Loli Rin as Teen Rin.</br></br>  Saber sounds like she's 40  <br>From what I've heard that may not really be the case? It sounded like Apocrypha was more well received than Zero was from what feedback I've seen.</br>  <br>Not his dank meme again.</br>  This is laughably bad, hilariously so.

I don't know, 'exaggerated' American accent? I suppose it could possibly be that they just kinda stand out more being juxtaposed against everything else I know to be Japanese, I'm not sure.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Will need to watch that then</br>  <br>Zero would be better for shitposting on /co/</br>  <br>I'd say it's tied with Bo-bobo</br>  why is it in dubs they always seem to over enunciate everything?<br><br>It's like they try too hard or something.</br></br>  <br>Bryce Papenbrook as Shirou?

Their light novels do pretty well despite what people think actually.</br>  <br>That's the new sound effect for Gandr.</br>   Saber doesn't sound british <br> Lancer doesn't sound irish <br>Literally shit tier. The rest of the cast is awful but those 2 could have redeemed it in a way subs can't. Is it really that much of a leap in logic to capitalize on what a dub can do better? <br>Seriously whats the point? They know they can't match up to stuff like Nakata so they need every advantage they can get.</br></br></br>  <br>This sounds like total shit. Kill youselves if you seriously considered watching this.</br>  <br>s-shirou?</br>  <br>I have yet to watch the videos but I'm going with its shit.</br>  man I would have been okay with everything but Archer sounds bad  <br> there are english dub VAs that have or can do good accents <br><br>Keep dreaming</br></br></br>  <br> Saber doesn't sound british <br> Lancer doesn't sound irish <br><br>That's actually fine. You create a bunch of plot holes if you actually try and make the servants sound like where they came from. Everyone has a funny accent except Archer for some reason. Wonder where he's from?</br></br></br></br>  <br> no based Liam as Archer <br> Shirou is now Eren <br>Do we start an online petition or something?</br></br></br>  <br>I think you meant  nasueating </br>  <br> Shirou has same voice as Kirito and Eren <br>American dub companies know when a character is shit at least.</br></br>  <br>doho</br>  REMINDER THAT PAPENBROOK WILL ALSO VOICE THE HEAVEN'S FEEL MOVIES.<br><br>THIS IS YOUR "FATE".</br></br>  This is eventually air on Toonami and the best thing about it will be spoiling /co/ fags.  &gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/  <br> speaking english <br> no accents <br>Nigger I don't care if this is Japan. If you're gonna waste money on a shit dub at least put some effort into it. As far as accents go it really doesn't matter for Archer. He lost his memories or something and is generally mysterious. Unless they gave him a Jap accent along with assassin. Honestly If you left the greeks alone you can bet by with it easy.</br></br></br>  <br>F/Z Seiba is best Seiba.</br>  <br><br>I can't believe that even in something as mainstream as fucking UBW they still refuse to edit pauses in like fanworks have done for years.<br>No one fucking speaks like that</br></br></br>  <br>It's sounds like they were trying to emulate Sherou from Luvia's voice.</br>  <br>To give more time to actually talk? I have no doubt that would benefit the dub but the actors are still awful.</br>  I honestly don't think I'll ever get used to dubs. It probably doesn't have anything to do with whether or not it's good or not, but all of it makes me cringe for some reason.  <br>When is Saber going to receive an equipment remake/update?</br>  <br>It literally doesn't make sense if you think about it for more than five seconds. What would a British accent from King Arthur's era be? What's an ancient Babylonian accent? None of the characters ever bring up how the their voices sound when trying to figure out where a servant is from, so you create a plot hole by just adding that in.</br>  You really expect me to watch that shit?   Shirou <br>Decent.<br><br> Rin <br>I actually like this voice<br><br> Kotomine <br>FUCK YEAH CRISPIN FREEMAN<br><br> Archer <br>What the fuck is this trash?<br> Deen stay night Archer was perfect</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is so, so bad. It's baffling when Fate/Zero had such a good dub and parts of the DEEN series and movie were great.<br><br>Anyone who did Archer after O'Brien was going to be a step down, but the new guy is the worst guy in the entire video. Holy shit.<br><br>New Shirou isn't much better.<br><br>That voice actress has done Rin before and isn't getting any better.<br><br>I really wanted Jamieson Price to come back, but I knew it was never going to happen. Here's hoping Freeman isn't continuously saddled with lines as awkward as "You ought to be rejoicing, boy."<br><br>The only two who don't suck out loud are Dahlgren as Saber and the new girl as Illya.

It doesn't fit his personality whatsoever, it sounds like Deermud.  <br>What's that.</br>  <br>Tony Oliver has been voicing Lancer since DEEN Stay Night. I felt like he's done a pretty decent job.</br>  <br>She sounds like a child. Voice hardly suits the character.</br>  <br>I'm not even going to blame the voice actors, it's whoever is directing them and not telling them what to enunciate and what tone they should be speaking in. I doubt anyone has actually read or watched the source material.</br>  <br><br>Nope. It is literally a 1 to 1 what rin would sound like in english.<br><br>Try harder weebs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not even upset at the VAs. They aren't good but nobody could maker those lines sound like anything other than ear cancer<br><br>Who wrote this script? Who edited it?<br>Who seriously read the lines these VAs were handed and said "this is acceptable"?<br><br>I could do a fucking better job of it and I translate japanese fetish porn for fuck's sake. Do the idiots behind that script not know what the english language sounds like?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well I've only heard a single line, but that doesn't sound like Lancer at all. Maybe it's just the script.</br>  <br>You can go back to reddit anytime now.</br>  <br>Please kill yourself.</br>  <br>I think I get you. Same voice but the lines I've heard in this trailer make it pretty clear the script has been pretty poorly translated. <br><br>Lancer is speaking in that stilted, mock-epic kind of way that fit Diarmuid's character but has not place in Lancer's dialogue. He's a pretty casual guy.

The original voices sans Kirei were all trash anyway.  <br>Fuck off. They gave legitimate answers that most people will agree with while you're being a massive faggot.

The guys in charge of casting must have thought that people would recognize their voices if they returned from their F/Z roles.<br><br>Also, David Vincent was Assassin in DEEN/Stay Night and Gil in F/Z.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br> muh nihon ichiban <br><br>Face it, english voice fits her character way better.

He was PERFECT for Archer.

It's like the new guy put too much emphasis in the wrong words, like he's trying too hard.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>That's not even an excuse.<br><br>Performance is extremely versatile, and a lot of lines can be stretched or compressed to fit mouth movements by performance from the actors/actresses<br><br>And even within that restriction, things like "you ought to be rejoicing, boy" have absolutely no excuse. Every word from that trailer reeks of either being too literal, or being localization from the mouth of someone that doesn't know enough of the english language to localize. I'm guessing most of the translation gruntwork was done by some 2nd or 3rd generation chinese immigrant weeaboo liking in texas, and then passed over by some minimum wage college yahoo editor only checking grammar mistakes.<br><br>Japanese has an awkward predilection of indicating subjects excessively (eg. rather than "I can't move", it's "my body can't move". Rather than "I have to run" it's "my feet have to run")<br><br>Any good translator simplifies a lot of those awkward subjects because in english, fucking nobody says "my feet need to run". Yet, in that trailer alone there were several lines where an awkward subject was left in, ostensibly because the amateur on the script is too stupid or lazy to bother making it sound like english.<br><br>I almost feel bad for whoever has to actually read that garbage, because they're going to sound like amateurs spouting stilted ESL goobbledygook no matter how broadway their delivery is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/a/'s luck is too high for your shit.</br>  <br><br> Kirito's dub actor <br><br>NOPE</br></br></br></br>  Keep in mind that the voice clips that they use for the trailer aren't usually the final cuts.

He's the lead role for everything now.<br><br>He's not that good.</br></br>  <br>It was a fun pairing because they're total bros in real life. <br><br>The only enjoyment I got out of watching the movie's dub was hearing them yell at each other for like 90 minutes.</br></br></br>  <br> Hero of Justice <br> Not ALLY of Justice <br><br>Try again, it's shit. Like all US dubs</br></br></br></br>  <br>Agreed<br><br>The movie was shit, but the bitchfest/fight in the castle as Liam O'Archer tears into Shirou was one of the best things Fate I've ever seen.</br></br></br>  <br> Ally of Justice <br> Not Superhero </br></br>  <br>It's not really fair to compare some english nobody like cripsin freeman to jouji nakata.<br><br>We all know going in the dub won't be as good as the original, that's just a standard for dubs, and isn't really a productive avenue for criticism.<br><br>There are a lot of better ways to criticize the english kirei voice than by saying it's not as good as jouji nakata. Very few people will ever be as good as jouji nakata</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Liam O Brien is a massive loss. The fact that he probably only didn't get it because he voiced Kariya is bullshit. Who cares if it's the same VA twice? He's too good to get rid of<br><br>I'm a huge dubfag, Sam Riegel was Shirou in all the deen crap, and he was usually serviceable, and sometimes pretty good. Bryce is an absolutely awful English Shirou. Just doesn't seem to know what he's doing<br><br>But that could just be the voice director or writers' faults</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was wrong to say saber is god-tier but fuck man kotomine gave me chills<br><br>Overall I agree with your opinions</br></br></br>  <br>The even greater thing about that casting, was that Liam O Brien sounds very similar to Sam Riegel, just a shitload deeper.</br>  <br>His only good role was  Masaomi Kida </br>  Why does Rin sound like a loli and the loli doesn't?  <br>That really shouldn't matter. <br><br>Jamieson Price was DEEN Kirei and ufo Alexander.

Are you fucking kidding me? God dammit. Why couldn't they have replaced Sam Riegel with someone who is actually good like Johnny Yong Bosch?<br>And who's the dipshit who decided to replace based Liam O'Brien as the voice of Archer with a fucking nobody?<br>Fuck I'm mad...</br></br></br>  <br>I'm curious more than anything. I've watched every episode of UBW at least three times at this point. I'm sure I'll watch it in English at some time too.</br>  <br> being addicted </br>  <br>It's really not that hard.<br><br>One viewing for the live stream. Another viewing for subs.

I watch cause I like it. There's no weird internet peer pressure here.</br>  <br>Oh really? I'll watch it again to see if I can catch that. I'm this guy </br>  <br>Some people actually enjoy watching the detail they put into the scenes instead of reading lines of text once and a while.</br>  My ears hurt. Fuck that Shirou voice   dub   If only there were good VAs and directors in dubbing anime.<br><br>Imagine based fucking Troy Baker as Archer or something. Hell he could voice everybody and I'd still watch it.</br></br>  <br>Too bad this is another low budget shit tier job. Terrible translation. Terrible line delivery.

Voice actors just dont match the characters well. Shirou voice sounds like a decent VA, just not a good cast for Shirou.</br></br>  <br>Troy Baker doesn't to anime anymore. He only ever does MCs in video games.</br>  <br>When I heard the cast announced earlier today I immediately went to some of the dub scenes from KLK to compare. If he keeps using his Tsumugu voice instead of what we heard in the trailer, then he could be a good Archer. Liam O'Brien is still better though.</br>  Tohsaka voice sounds goddamn awful.  <br>A person of her time would not have a modern english accent</br>  Fucking terrible. Why does Aniplex even try.  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=LlD<wbr>7y-Dbsw0&amp;t=2m</wbr>  [ ]<br>I liked the guy they got for DEEN's dub better</br></br>  <br><br><br>It has nothing to do with the length of the reading. Its the disconnect non-Japanese speakers experience when reading subs regardless at how long they have been watching them. You are literally reading lines off the script then looking back at the action to see whats going on instead of it being unified and synchronous. Make no mistake, I much prefer subs now but I didn't start that way. It will never be the same as watching something in your native language. If you disagree you're simply being a fuckhead who wants to argue about dumb shit.</br></br></br>  <br>You actually have to look directly at the subs to read them?</br>  <br>Reddit really likes UBW. In fact, they probably tie with /a/ as the websites which like it the most.</br>  <br> You are literally reading lines off the script then looking back at the action to see whats going on <br>I am neither illiterate nor brain damaged so I'm capable of doing both at the same time, like most people</br></br>  <br> they even ruined his dumb chant <br>How is that good?</br></br>  <br>Nah, it's an issue of familiarity. Once you get used to it, there's not that disconnect anymore. Watch anime for a decade or two, and even if you don't know nip the subtitles will stop speaking in your mind. <br><br>Looking back and forth? Takes a fraction of a second, if any time at all. Your reading skills must suck to not be able to read and watch at the same time. <br><br><br>Dubfags trying to find excuses, but really just showing how fucking mongoloid they are<br><br><br>Well, I don't know jack shit about lebbit, so there's that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Based Liam.</br>  <br> Dubfags trying to find excuses, but really just showing how fucking mongoloid they are <br><br>Did you quote the wrong post?</br></br></br>  <br>The problem is that Americans simple aren't talented enough to do a good dub.</br>  <br>Not that anon, but the post he made makes sense. He's saying that dubfags are just looking for excuses.</br>  <br>I wouldn't say talent, there are some really good voice actors in the west.<br><br>They just aren't doing anime</br></br></br>  <br>NOT LIKE THIS</br>  <br>I love how they made a significant improvement to Shirou Emiya but they left Rin Tohsaka with the same woman.</br>  <br> they made a significant improvement to Shirou Emiya </br>  <br>Did you not here Sam Riegal?</br>  <br>I will take a fucking Teenager Mutant Ninja Turtle over Kirito.</br>  Why do companies even bother dubbing shows at all?  <br>You're supposed to be listening to the voice acting, not the script.</br>  <br>Netflix, Hulu, and Toonami.</br>  <br>Wow, he is really Kirito? What a weird choice. I had no idea.<br><br> Rin Okumura in Blue Exorcist, Kirito in Sword Art Online, Masaomi Kida in Durarara!!, and Eren Jaeger in Attack on Titan. <br><br>Do you know who they got for Lancer or Archer? I can't tell.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Autists like<br>will ear it up. And there are many like him.</br></br>  <br>Do they not broadcast things unless they are dubbed into English?</br>  <br> ear <br>eat*</br></br>  <br>Because there is a market for people who don't want to watch anime in Japanese and want to listen to dubbed anime.</br>   Kiritsugu gets based Matthew Mercer who played Leon from Resident Evil <br> Shirou gets SAO bullshit <br><br>Why is this okay?</br></br></br>  <br>Netflix and Hulu default to English, and it grabs in the normies way more than something subbed. I only remember seeing subbed anime on really high up TV channels like, a decade ago. It's either dubbed, or not on the air at all.</br>  <br>The only role he's done is this guy for klk.</br>  <br>Honestly, listening to the cringeworthy dubbed lines hurts the experience way more.</br>  <br> sticking Cristina Vee on Sakura <br>I don't know if I'm more happy that she's Sakura or mad that she's basically not on an important role until a fucking dub of Heaven's Feel god forbid.<br><br>It's so fucking hilarious how all the good ones are stuck as side characters this time around, since they are trying to stay consistent with Fate Zero. Bryce Papenbrook is a fucking faggot, and I can't believe they brought back Mela Lee and not Liam O' Brien for Archer. This fucking stinks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So far:<br><br>Good<br>Ilyasveil<br>Kotomine<br><br>TBA<br>Lancer<br>Saber<br>Archer<br><br>Oh dear god why<br>Rin<br>Shirou<br><br><br>Gilgamesh is going to be David Vincent(Jin) like in F/Z, so expect that to be bad. I hated his F/Z voice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Who voices Kotomine nowadays?  <br> &gt;Good <br> Ilyasveil <br>Kill yourself. Even the prisma dub did her better.</br></br></br>  <br>Crispin Freeman (zero). George Nakata (Japanese).</br>  <br> Your Fate/stay night [Unlimited Blade Works] is now my Fate/stay night [Unlimited Blade Works]. <br><br>God damnit Seiba</br></br></br>  <br>I meant English VA, of course. He dosen't have a deep enough voice for Kotomine but I imagine none of the English dub VAs do.</br>  <br> I share a name with the guy who voices him </br>  <br>Papenbrook's a weird name.</br>  The saddest part is that doesn't matter how much we complain, Shirou will now be Eren/Kirito and there's nothing we can do about it.    <br>Shirou sounds like a literal faggot in the dub. Who thought this was a good idea?</br>  <br>God, what I wouldn't do to have a voice like George Nakata.</br>  <br>That guy is literally the voice for MCs right now just like Haberkorn and JYB before him.<br><br><br>I wish he did more anime roles, all of the ones he did were supporting roles like Schneizel and Pain, but I guess it's to be expected since he can get paid way more to do video games instead.</br></br></br></br>  Tony Oliver, the guy who voiced Lancer in the "Every time my Gay Bulge..." scene is directing the voice acting  Will this imitation surpass the original?  <br> エサinstead of 餌 <br>Why?</br></br>  <br>He was always Sasuke before that anyway. Shirou has never really had a good VA. UBW was probably the first time I thought his VA actually did a pretty good job.</br>  <br> Dub <br><br>Its shit. Only retards watch dubbed anime.<br><br><br><br>Because retards like redditors will buy their release and love the dub no matter how bad it is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>they still are relatively soon according to the comments</br>  Let's see what the chefs in the YouTube comments have to say about all this:<br><br> I still don't like Shirou's VA the rest are ok but the voice doesn't fit in my mind... <br><br> Not feeling this cast...None of the voices fit quite right, I love all of the actors, but not for these characters... <br><br> I love Bryce but... I don't think he'll make a good Shirou.... <br><br> Sorry Nonons voice for Rin just feels wrong to me. And my god Bryce take a break already I swear he is the new Johnny Young Bosh or Yuri Lowenthol. He is everywhere. <br><br> Oh boy...i'm not sure how to take this. I want to believe this'll be a good dub, the Zero dub surprised me with its decentness, and they got rid of Shirou's teenage mutant ninja turtle voice which is good. <br><br> But on the other hand, Archer's cool voice got taken Aut. and Shirou's replacement is...a guy that basically does every voice. Its like they got JYB for Shirou. Atleast all the other voices are carried over, which is good. I thought Arturia, Sakura, Rin and Gil's Zero english voices were good, so we'll see <br><br> Bryce really what happens to the other guy sorry forgot dudes name Bryce does not fit Shirou miscast or a rush job for Shirou. <br><br> Why do they always pick Bryce to be the VA of english dubs? He is a freakin j0ke. Always sounds like a whiny little kid. : ( <br><br> Seeing as how Shirou is a whiny character I guess Bryce fits for that. Though it might make him too obnoxious. Good to know they kept most of the dub cast from Fate Zero. Kinda bummed that Liam O'Brien isn't Archer though. Maybe the ones they replaced might do a good job. <br><br> What the fuck happened to Sam Riegel? Was he found dead in a ditch somewhere? I actually want to keep a consistent voice, but no! Dubs for the Fate series always freakin' changes now! Because now every time I hear Shirou talk, I keep on hearing freakin Kirito! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck no, he already sucks. Why didn't he get the role???</br>  You know who should Papenbrook be voicing now? Shinji, he's the perfect Shinji.  <br> Seeing as how Shirou is a whiny character I guess Bryce fits for that </br>  Is Tony Oliver coming back as Lancer? This is important, he was definitely the funniest part of the DEEN dub.  <br>You could have just said that there are retards.</br>  <br>Yep he's back as Lancer.</br>  <br>It gets better </br>  <br><br>ktkr<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=eRw<wbr>y1Nu5Q2I</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>   saber doesnt have a british accent <br> lancer doesnt sound irish <br> lolislut sounds older than rin <br> rin sounds 9 years old <br> archer sounds almost gay <br>atleast they did archer right</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Ready or not I will come to take your life! <br><br>At least something enjoyable come out after all of this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rin and Illya need to switch places. It would still be shit though but a bit better.</br>  <br>Papenbrook is so over-exposed. I don't see how anyone could self-insert as one of the many characters that have his same voice without diluting the experience.</br>   Command Seal <br> Hero of Justice <br> The blue man... and the white man... <br> Wow, you really are an Archer! </br></br></br>  I'm going to sleep, completely disappointed in humanity.

Get the fuck of this site.</br>  <br>Recently, I've noticed a WHOLE lot of controversy with Reddit's new CEO having policies that most users don't seem to agree with. Lots of people comparing her to a dictator. <br><br>Now that they've fired Victoria, the showrunner of AMA, I feel like the site might be going downhill. <br><br>I hear Voat might be becoming it's replacement in the same way that Reddit was Digg's replacement after Digg jumped the shark. The userbase is a lot less PC than Reddit's is, though that could change over time.</br></br></br></br></br>  I think the bigger thing to takeaway is the fact that the BDs are 180 dollars.

Never mind then, not even gonna get my hopes up that we'll get something worthwhile out of this.</br>  <br>Aniplex knows that Western Fate/fags will lap that shit up even with their outdated Japanese business model.</br>  <br>I could maybe see 180 for like, the whole series, plus all the bonus material like the art books, soundtracks, GoA, and drama CDs. That's closer to being a more reasonable Collector's Edition type thing. But for just half the series that's bullshit.</br>  <br> do you think this could mean they'll include a translated version of GoA? <br>no</br></br>  <br>You get a trading card instead.</br>  <br> ・Exclusive Weiss Schwarz Collectible PR Card (while supplies last) <br><br>B A S E D<br>A<br>S<br>E<br>D<br><br>Also I noticed the booklet is about 26 pages shorter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jameson price did a pretty good job (voiced UBW movie Kirei,Zero Rider, and a few others). Probably the best choice they could make. Same with Liam O' for Archer. They match well with Nakata and Suwabe, respectively. Too bad</br>   No Sam Riegel as Shirou <br> No Liam O'Brien as Archer <br> FUCKING BRYCE PAPENBROOK AS ANOTHER MAIN CHARACTER <br><br>What is the point?<br><br>I can't handle hearing Asbel/Makoto as the main character in every fucking show, Jesus Christ.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't know a single English speaking person who plays Weiss Schwarz.</br></br>  <br>I love you.</br>  <br>His performance in Blue Exorcist was pretty good. Maybe that one just had a better director.</br>  <br><br>It would probably sound closer to Latin then English. She was Romano-British after all.<br><br>Though I would admit giving her a British Accent, and Cu an Irish one would be agreeable to me. Make Gil sound Iraqi as well.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, as DBZ Abridged taught me, you can modify the mouths to better fit English Dialogue with only a small degree of effort in the computer. So why they don't do that more is beyond me.</br></br>   people still watch dubs   <br>I play Weiss Schwarz, so do 2 of my best friends. <br><br>I have 3 different Bakemonogatari decks.</br></br></br>  <br>That gets into editing territory, which could annoy some studios, directors, and fans. You can't exactly advertise a set as "uncut" when you are changing things around, even if it's not due to censorship.</br>  <br><br>They've done good dubs. Bebop and El Hazard.<br><br>I don't know how dubs like that can come into being given the shit state of the dub industry though. What magic formula is there to make a good dub? Anyone here have an idea?</br></br></br></br>   american anime dubbers <br> decent in anyway <br><br>They don't use the correct inflections and don't understand how to roll with the flow of words/terms.<br><br>It will never be good. Just like spongebob dubbed in spanish is probably shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  Everyone's voice is complete dogshit other than kotomine.<br><br>SHEE ROH</br></br>  <br><br>The Queen's Latin and all that jazz. If a character is English or Roman, they're expected to have a posh British Accent. It's just the way it's been portrayed over the years. Blame I Claudius for that.</br></br>  <br>Oddly, I've heard people say that stuff like the Spanish dub of The Simpsons is actually pretty good.</br>  <br>hire actual talent that give a shit about their work<br><br>too bad that only applies to shit made by miyazaki, and only because disney</br></br></br>  <br> exceptions to the rule <br><br>Ok? People also like the bebop dub, etc. Not saying the bebop dub is better than the original, but its at least mostly passable.</br></br></br>  Daily reminder that murican dubs will always be shit, learn2moon faggots.  <br>Step 1<br><br>Hire actual talent that has practiced this, went to school for it, etc. <br><br>Step 2<br><br>Try out more than the same 10 people for every single show you dub, and if you reuse someone, make sure they have a different inflection in their voice.<br><br>Step 3<br><br>Only hire passionate VA's that have watched the original and will understand how certain words/scenes should be voiced.<br><br>I'm sure there are more, but that would make them decent. The american VA scene is a tiny pool of people that just get circlejerked and never need to improve/get talent.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>True, but small edits like that could make dubbing far easier, especially if the main edits are entirely to dialogue (So mouths, lips and shit).</br></br>  Wait, Type-Moon created something other than Fate/Stay? Fate/Stay was the only game they made! I propose ONLY Fate/Stay is talked about! You're not allowed to talk about Tsukihime! It doesn't exist.  <br>Why do they dub them in the first place? It's not like Berserker has any dialogue to translate. Just leave it as is.</br>  <br>I would really like to give uFO my money for more future shit like this, but I can't affort any of these ;_;</br>  Literally Asbel from Tales of Graces.<br><br>Rin and Archer sound like shit.<br><br>Saber is decent.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Nihon time spec: 480mins <br> Murrican time spec: 420mins <br>Hahaha it doesn't even has the extra scenes. that's bullshit</br></br></br>  <br>Oh fuck off. JYB may be overused but he can at least act and has a good hero voice that doesn't sound like a pre-pubescent faggot.<br><br>Explain to me how this comment  makes me a newfag you stupid faggot.</br></br></br>   Big fan of most dubs <br> This adaptation of Fate has to have been my favourite ever. <br> Excited to hear the dub. <br> Hear Shirou's voice, think he sounds experienced and dorky but whatever, I can deal with this. <br> Rin actually sounds better than the original fate dub which is encouraging. <br> KOTOMINE ISN'T JAMIESON PRICE <br> ARCHER'S VOICE <br>yeah fuck this, I don't deserve this bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, that's actually the Japanese set trying to trick you into thinking you're getting more. They're adding in the soundtrack or some shit.<br><br>It's Aniplex trying to swindle you.</br></br></br>  Japanese Fate voice is too iconic for me. We have been following them for like what? almost 10 years now.<br><br>I can't deal with this disgusting dub.</br></br>  <br>Experienced = Inexperienced, sorry.</br>  <br>The Japanese VAs are on a whole different level. Call me when the English VA for Kirei hosts events dressed up as the guy, or when Sakura's dub voice literally cries at being so happy that HF got announced.</br>  <br><br>Same here. Though I do admit dubs these days seem worse then they were when I was young, and even those weren't good.</br></br>  <br>Ueda loves her role as Rin and has even fully read the VN. She's not just in it for a paycheck.</br>  Saber is Kohaku from the Tsukihime dub.  Oh my fucking god. I prefer to watch shows dubbed if the dub is good, but oh my god. That's positively horrendous. The only passable voice is Saber.<br><br>Shirou sounds weak.<br>Rin sounds like a little kid.<br>Kotomine's voice isn't remotely deep enough and is completely lacking his creepy draw-you-in charisma. Archer is just... Bad. And the one Lancer line we heard wasn't great.<br><br>Honestly, considering with the budget/how well-known it was, I was hoping they'd try to hire good VAs. I guess not.<br><br>Back to Bebop and YYH dubs it is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The problem isn't that you're used to the japanese voices, and I'm a dubfag. They chose horrible people to voice important characters like Shirou, Kotomine, and Archer. The only one who needed to change from the original F/SN anime cast was Shirou because he can't pronounce anything japanese worth shit.<br>Kotomine and Archer were fine, English-voice Archer fucked up the UBW chant in the first anime but had it fixed in the movie, and Dub!Kotomine voiced Edmond Dantes from this show, which was thrilling merely because of his delivery.</br></br>   Shirou's voice <br> Rin's voice <br> Illya's voice <br> Archer's voice <br><br>At least Kotomine is good.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alright my Japanese isn't very good, but did she really call the episode "2 cool"?<br><br>What else did she say, other than thank you at the end? My kanji is shit.</br></br></br>  <br>This. In fact, Saber sounds natural while everyone else sounds like they're trying to hard to match lipflaps and it comes out disgusting.<br>They do know the production values and how popular F/SN is right? How could they fuck up this bad?</br></br>  <br>There's no better feeling than when your Waifu does the classic Ohoho. I live for this moment right here.</br>  <br>even though the dub version has 1 BD disc less..</br>   dubsfags on /a/ <br><br>Disgusting. Why do you guys even come here instead of reddit?</br></br>  <br>Kotomine was better in the original.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PfS<wbr>lotJsOfQ&amp;t=1h12m15s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> Sakura's dub voice literally cries at being so happy that HF got announced <br>Somehow that gave me a better opinion of Sakura. Sounds like she has a good seiyuu.<br><br>But I'm pretty sure the contest for "biggest fan of your character" goes to Asuka's english dub VA. I wish I still had the link to the video where she shows her Asuka-ified apartment.</br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=yzv<wbr>In0mdXtY</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Crispin Freeman is a great voice actor and I like his voice, he's not a bad Kotomine.<br><br>This dub though feels like it suffers from extremely bad voice direction, which is what plagues most English dubs. Like, I have no clue what the fuck they were going for with that reading, or any of the readings I heard. Jesus Christ.</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much this, I don't care for dubs, but even if they got an actually decent cast of VAs I would still be opposed to it because of a decade of growing attached the the Japanese VAs.</br>  <br>The real questions isn't if it's good or bad.<br>The real question is whether or not Kari Wahlgren and Crispin Freeman can carry this shite cast.<br><br>Shirou is bad, but I could get use to it. I just wouldn't have to if the case was better or if the actor was better at his job.<br>Rin is terribad. <br>Everyone else is meh. <br><br>I liked Zero's dub, but it had the advantage of Ikesander, Saber, Kotomine, and Kiritsugu. <br>This is just sad. I'll stick to the subs. thanks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Speaking of, they didn't voice the H-Scenes in the original right? If they don't do HF as Realta, does that mean Sakura's seiyuu is going to have to vocalize those H-Scenes?<br><br>Either way it's not going to be pretty.</br></br></br></br>  <br> QUICK, WE NEED A VOICE FOR THE MC! <br> Um, um... BRYCE! <br><br>God<br>Damnit</br></br></br></br></br>  Bryce Papercock is literally the Yuki Kaiji of eng dub.

I found that to be really odd.<br><br>Unless Ufotable decided the first cour deserved the hour long specials..</br></br>  <br>filename</br>  Who is your favorite TYPE-MOON voice actor?  <br>Pacing. The visual novel wasn't made with a potential anime in mind, and Ufotable did their best to stop the first cour at a place that made the most sense, and did. They didn't want to cut out too much because almost every single scene in UBW was necessary.</br>  <br>Episode 12 being an hour long was a mid-production decisions. Before that I think they wanted to have the first two episodes kind rhyme with each other, with Rin getting a special, and Shirou getting a special.</br>  Anyone know where to find the English booklet that came with UBW?  <br> expecting me to believe that filename </br>  <br>What can I say, I thought Noriaki Sugiyama was great. He nailed every single important scene. Joji Nakata extremely close second.<br><br>Now if only he'd never voiced Sasuke.

Why didn't they just get whoever that is to do it?</br></br>  <br>NOT IT FUCKING DOES NOT.<br>EWW fucking DISGUSTING.</br></br>  <br>Because Sentai isn't Aniplex.</br>  <br>Fuck me.<br>The one time Sentai get's something right it's for a shitty spin off dub.</br></br>  <br><br>Mother of christ that Rin voice.

She even plays loli Rin in F/Z.<br>So is for Illya with Stephane Sheh.</br>  <br>Crispin was fine for Archer, the only issue originally was trying to match lipflaps and ruining the UBW chant.<br>Dubs mostly get ruined because of bad dialogue decisions.</br></br>  <br>They've gotten a hell of a lot better after getting rid of that disgusting bug, Foster.</br>  <br> Mela Lee played every Rin role so far, so at least their consistent <br><br>10 years of voicing Rin and she still sounds terrible. I know she hasn't been consistently playing the role like Ueda, but you'd think she'd adjust or something considering the Ufo version isn't exactly DEEN.</br></br></br>  <br>Stephanie Sheh is fine as Illya, I just wish the rest of the cast would pronounce her fucking name correctly. <br><br>Whoever voiced Rin in Prisma should do every Rin from now on, because Mela Lee is awful as voicing adult characters.</br></br></br>  <br>To be honest aniplex is not a great company.<br>This was just an unfortunate situation for everyone.</br></br>  <br>Eh. I like him as Kotomine.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=N4r<wbr>va_bA71k#t=5m05s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> aniplex is a completely ass-backwards company that doesn't understand how a market works. <br><br>ftfy</br></br></br>  <br><br>The thing is, I feel like the Second Cour could have used more episodes.<br><br>Or rather, the first cour could have given us insight on backstories as opposed to the first half of the second cour. Not to mention, Shirou vs Archer would have been beautiful as an hour long battle, as opposed to being split in chunks</br></br></br></br>  <br>Illya's voice is the only one that really matches, but for some reason it still makes me uncomfortable.</br>   Blue Excorcist <br> Attack on Titan <br> Sword Art Online <br> Probably more shit i'm not thinking of. <br><br>Please Bryce. Just stop. I'm normally one to defend dubs but jesus fucking christ. "You ought to be rejoicing boy." Really?! Fucking cancer.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> as opposed to being split in chunks <br><br>Thankfully that little problem is mostly gone now due not having to wait weeks between stuff.

Maybe Lancer's, didn't hear enough of him. And Haberkorn does good work so I guess he'll be a fine Assassin.<br><br>But oh my god, fucking Papenbrook as Shirou? And replacing the VERBAL SEX that is Junichi Suwabe with this shitty-ass VA should be a crime. This is doomed.</br></br></br>  <br>I, well, surprisingly actually agree with this.<br>I think it's great that they are consistent with it, but she doesn't seem to adjust her voice as she plays the voice throughout the years.<br>Doesn't help that it sounds like she is playing Rin as her loli counterpart in F/Z. She should have deepened her voice for this and adjusted.<br>Like with Christopher Sabat with Vegeta or Crispin Freeman as Zelgadis</br></br></br></br>  <br>M-maybe it'll sound better? The Kill la Kill dub trailer sounded like fucking shit blended with Angra Mainyu but I'm watching it now and it actually sounds natural.<br>I just want the dub to my new favourite anime to be good, man.</br></br>  <br>We all do, anon.

Keep a lookout on Nyaa this weekend for BD ISO, I don't know how to encode but I'll just throw up the disc image.  I haven't watch this since Episode 4. Did the show get better during Episodes 5-12?  <br>That was end of the Koki episodes.<br>I personally wasn't too fond of them myself either but its back to Ninja Slayer after episode 4.</br></br>  <br>Good. Episode 3-4 were pretty boring to be honest.</br>  SOMEBODY STITCH TOGETHER ALL THOSE NANCY SHOTS, MY DICK NEEDS THEM  <br>YEEART!!</br>  Yukano a cute  HS subs are out.  http://www.viewster.com/serie/1309-<wbr>19449-012/#<br>Here's a link for whoever rips Viewster because they decided to go full retard with their site</br></wbr>  BASED TRIGGER<br>A<br>S<br>E<br>D<br><br>T<br>R<br>I<br>G<br>G<br>E<br>R</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I feel like the whole point of her character is to give everybody an erection, especially bondagefags.</br>    Holy fucking shit i cant stop laughing  <br> he talks with his claw <br><br>I find it funnier than I should</br></br></br>  This episode was lewd.  <br>very lewd</br>  <br>This entire episode was full bondage.</br>  <br>Wasshoi</br>   that bio-iaido shirt   <br><br><br><br>I thought she's a STRONG FEMALE CHARACTER</br></br></br></br>  Nancy-san is so awesome.  Will Nancy ever stop being useless?  <br>As soon as Nancy stops being so lewd.</br>  <br>Nancy is useful.</br>  <br>She did give the Takeuchi vaccine. Too bad Sensei died after taking it, though.</br>  Wait, Ninja Slayer is a two cour show?  Nancy-san captured again?<br>And so dishonored?</br>  DOUJINS WHEN?  <br>Yes.</br>  I hoped he would just cut off his arm and then say he was no longer a ninja. Poor scientist.  <br>She's useful for making my dick hard</br>  Viewster when?  <br> ... </br>  Another episode, another proof that Darkninja makes everything better, even when he has next to zero screentime.   you will never save Nancy    Ninja Slayer-san seeing the result of losing oneself to vengeance <br><br>Deep.<br><br> Also kinda useless because he already seems pretty in control, otherwise he would have slayed Koki and destroyed the dragon dojo himself. </br></br></br></br>  <br>he was evil and deserved to die. desperation is no excuse for succumbing to debauchery</br>  <br> next to zero <br>He had 1/3 of the episode all to himself, though.</br></br>   all those disgusting HSfags ITT   Make a compilation of all those glorious nippon poses please  I want Yukano, not more of Nancy.  webm when?  <br>Of course she is. She wears a skin tight outfit, that's what being a strong female character means.</br>   That sorrowful theme that plays when Ninja Slayer has to put down NeoLobster=san   Why was Nancy drooling? Is she starting to like it?  <br>She's accepted her destiny.</br>  <br>She's actually a faux action girl. But that just makes her scenes funnier.</br>  <br>YEEART!</br>  <br>YEEART!</br>  <br> the doujins write themselves <br> none get written <br>it's sad. do Kancolle and Touhou really deserve all that hype?</br></br></br>  Yukano when  <br>HS gets the mood better for an anime like this/.<br><br>Viewster's subs are more in line with a shitty fansubbed anime in the mid 00's, while HS gets the proper mood of buying a mid-90's official anime VHS.</br></br></br>  Oh, look, a new manga cover.  http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>07238<br>Viewster's up, sorry I'm late</br></wbr>  Viewster whe--<br><br>Oh thank you</br></br>  <br>Yep, thanks, that's exactly how I was getting the episodes before they were actually up in their list.

This show pretends to be a shallow yet masterful parody, but you wouldn't see this kind of character development for the villain in that sort of thing, normally. More proof that Ninj@ Conspiracy are geniuses.  <br>I don't know why, but DARK Ninja-san appeals to me as a character. Perhaps its his Nippon Steel (that was broken by the karate of NINJA Slayer) or his cool character design.<br>I'm very interested in his story.</br></br>  <br><br>DOMO Anon-san.</br></br>  Nancy was great this episode. I always wonder how the seiyuu feel about voicing these sorts of things. Did Chiwa record different times for each instance? I know at least two of those were different screams in spite of being the same lines.  <br> I want Yukano, not more of Nancy. <br><br>I am so incredibly bored of Nancy it's not even funny</br></br></br>  <br><br>How long until the manga series and novels are published in the west?</br></br>        <br>I tried making a webm for that, but I failed horribly and it takes too long in here anyway.

Kobayashi, a boy who goes to this school, meets genius detective Akechi, who comes to the school to investigate. Kobayashi takes an interest in Akechi and, in spite of his friend Hashiba's worries, he volunteers to be Akechi's assistant.<br><br>Also, reminder that the cute ass is a  trap </br></br></br></br></br>   &gt;trap <br><br>My interest has peaked.</br></br>  Doesn't look like it'll be great, but I can't resist that cute trap butt.  <br> trap <br>I'd care if it were a reverse trap, but still watching for mystery.</br></br>  <br> FUNIMASHIT </br>  I wanna tap Kobayashi  I really want this to be good, guys.  The writer and director have done some good stuff. This looks like a different style though.  <br> mfw most new titles on Thursday are picked up by Funi </br>  When will noitaminA try to throw something new about Cabaneli? Gonna ask this in every noitamina threads until WIT will finally reveal something!  <br> generic shit <br> generic shit <br> suddenly trap <br>ok sold.</br></br></br></br>  Will we get Kobayashi shower scenes?  <br>Hopefully we need this so we can confirm this by judging his overall torso and hips.</br>  Damn, Noitama has become shit already  <br>See <br><br>Cabaneli needs to save noitaminA immediately.</br></br></br>  There's no way this isn't gay, right?  <br>Just like Guilty Crown save anime huh ?</br>  <br>Not really. Araki has explicitly said sometime before that he needs to redeem himself with his next original work. Not only that, I seriously hope WIT Studio will redeem itself too after working on 3 years of low quality televised stories.</br>  <br>Dark horse of the season. It can be a masterpiece, or horrible shit.<br><br>Hope for first, but believe rather in second. The last serious detective story (not counting Hyouka, Kamisama Memochou) was Un Go and Supernatural Tantei Yakumo. This one reminds the last, will see how it goes.</br></br></br>  <br>But, will he redeem himself ?<br><br>I thought he already busy with SnK season 2 for 2016. And if Cabaneli delayed til next year, then it has high chance to be fail again.<br><br>But yeah, I hope he will delivers something good, at least like what he used to be in madhouse.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, I hear somewhere in 2ch that Cabaneli is scheduled for next winter when it was first announced alongside Game of Laplace and Subete ga F ni Naru (November 27 to be precise).</br>  Glasses is in love with trap, trap is in love with genius and genius is in love with the thrill of the chase.  <br>So its Phi Brain?</br>  <br>He is straight.<br><br>Kogoro Akechi is a tall, handsome man with heavy eyebrows who dresses well. He is married to a woman named Fumiyo (文代) and lives with Yoshio Kobayashi, the leader of the Boy Detectives Club. Kobayashi often plays an important part in solving cases. Like his mentor, he is an expert at disguise and is especially adept at posing as a young woman. Aside from these relationships little is known of the detective's personal life, which always takes a back seat to the mystery in his adventures.</br></br></br>  <br>pupa 2.0</br>  <br>All of that fits with my hypothesis.</br>  Now that i checked PV, it looks like shit. Too bad.<br><br>Wished a quality mystery..<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=iLc<wbr>64phEhgI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>If only we could get another one as good as that.</br>  <br><br>Watch Hyouka if you have not.</br></br>  <br>Of course i have. Hyouka however is hardly a proper mystery in that sense. I still watch Conan and watched Kindaichi when it aired - those were the only classic detectives of recently.<br><br>Terror in Resonance had some mystery going, but turned out to be shallow. Hopefully Pluto will get anime eventually by Mappa.</br></br></br>  Episode 1 starting in 5 minutes.  <br>I guess no one watching this?</br>  <br>I'll be watching, not sure what to expect honestly.</br>  get in here niggas   Butterfly symbolism <br>I guess Seiji Kishi worked too much on Persona.</br>  who homos here?  <br>I'll be watching, with subs.</br>  I came now, what did I miss? This is original right?  <br> Comparing Hyouka to Mouryou no Hako <br><br>I liked both but you are deluded if you think hyouka is a mystery, much less a good one.</br></br></br>  <br>Any other group doing this aside Funi?</br>  <br>I got to say, disfigured corpse aesthetic is such cliche for mystery its shame to use it with rare exceptions.<br><br>I`d rather have genius antagonist than psychotic. There are so many ways to be just as cruel, but more stylish and creative.</br></br></br>  <br>This was so great. To think almost never watched it, I'd have really missed out then.</br>  <br>Perfect gengtlemen murder &gt; peril &gt; maniacs</br>  is it a girl or boy  <br>What does your penis tell you?</br>  <br> pink <br>Girl</br></br>  <br>Well they are wearing pink and the guy is in blue. That's a very elaborate ruse if it's not a girl.</br>   32 years old sensei with neko ears <br>dropped</br>  <br>Mei tantei know no gender.</br>  <br>I would hit it either way.</br>   Unnamed character is in silhouettes <br> Silhouette removed when they are officially introduced. </br>  <br>I swear I just heard the guy call her shounen</br>  Tell me it's good. Lie if you must.  <br>I hate it.</br>  <br>At least they're doing something creative with it.<br>There's even potential to use it for a twist.</br></br>  <br> Take a prominent serious mystery novel. <br> make generic anime Absolute Duo shit </br></br>  So it's a boy? I'm fairly sure it was just saying how he was often mistaken for a girl but I still don't believe it.  <br>Its shit</br>  <br>Who is that cute girl?</br>  <br>It's better than Gangsta. Maybe, kinda.</br>  <br>I`ll reserve my judgement until we`ll actually know what mystery is about.<br><br>Yeah it looks like shit, cheap like shit, style like shit - but maybe the actual plot will be half decent, which is what matters.</br></br></br>  This new black haired guy is pretty cute  <br>Good artistic choice.</br>  <br>Nah at least that was entertaining</br>    <br>Psycho Pass 2.0</br>  <br>Cute ass is BOY OR GIRL? Can someone please answer before I watch this and get disappointed.</br>  <br>I`d buy some of those. Looks comfy.</br>  Looks like Yaoi Kuma Arashi. Without kumas.  she's a reverse trap right?  right? ;_;   <br> Fate/Zero 2.0 <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br>Boy<br><br>Fuck the guy he hangs out with</br></br></br>  <br>Girl<br>dont believe all the faggot fuckers</br></br>  <br>It wishes to be that fun.</br>   No actual PV for episode 2, only some pictures <br>I'm disappointed.</br>  <br><br>Come on, guys.</br></br>  <br>Any shots of Kobayashi's cute butt?</br>  that's one sad panda  <br>Where they put the heads? It'll be a waste to dispose them without using them</br>  <br>I'm fairly sure it's a boy. I'm sure they were saying how he was often mistaken for a girl at one point.<br><br>I say fairly sure since I don't really believe it myself and it's making me doubt what I think I heard. Plus he was called shounen at one point.</br></br></br>  <br>Giving them heads would give them identity, the point is to turn them into objects.</br>  <br> male:threesome male:anal male:gangbang </br>  Just a proof japanese litterature is overrated shit  Wait so when and how are we getting subs for this? We can't count on HS, right?  <br>Funi picked this up but they haven't said when the simulcast is actually going to start.</br>  <br>What about a maniacal gentleman murderer?</br>  <br>Are you stupid enough to think this is a novel adaption?</br>  <br>Its not direct novel adaptation, but is based on quit known japanese mystery novel.<br><br>Like Sherlock TV or Elementary are based on Sherlock Holmes original stories.</br></br></br>  OP: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>wcud9<br>ED: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>wcv0x</wbr></br></wbr>  <br>Detective Conan`s "Kogoro Mori" is based on character of this novels series Author. Conans "kids detective club" as well.<br><br>So yeah, its right in the name says "Ranpo" aka writers name. Characters are all based on his novels too, including the trap.</br></br></br>  <br>Loose adaptations don't reflect the quality of the original work.</br>  <br>OP is not the best, but like live action parts. Would be nice if anime had them too.</br>  <br> Edogawa Ranpo is authors name <br> Edogawa Conan <br> Kogoro - Kogoro Mori <br> Ran <br> detective club <br>etc.<br><br>Reminds me i have 4 episodes of Detective Conan to watch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127485487 <br>How the hell did you figure that out?<br><br>Its straight Sherlock Holmes style (since author was fan faggot that copied him exactly) detective story.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127485487 <br>Eh</br>  <br>butthurt laplacefag is butthurt face it its shit</br>  <br>Very strange imagery in both.</br>  <br>I dont expect it to be good, i dont thinkt here even are any laplace-fags yet, i`ll wait to see if they actually manage to make it interesting (meanwhile Conan is in interesting ark atm and is better Ranpo inspired work anyway).<br><br>However calling it Glaslip is like calling God Eater Non Non Biyori</br></br></br>  Looks like episode 1 is out at Funi site.<br>http://www.funimation.com/shows/ram<wbr>po-kitan/videos/official/the-human-<wbr>chair-part-1</wbr></wbr></br>  I thought of giving this a chance but shit, this must be the gayest season I've ever experience after the one where Free started airing. First off we get a show that's blatant yaoi, another one that was yaoi at first, like I mean YAOI MAD YAOI, but people complained and the MC is now a reverse trap, and now this shit? <br><br>Is japan trying to shut up the faggots and fujoshits? I think I'll be watching 5 shows max this season.</br></br>  <br>Thank you based Funi</br>  <br> 127486235 <br>shit wrong thread and can't delete this shit.</br></br>  <br>The kid is not trap nor gay. He is kid of famouse detective Akechi Kogoro, running a detective boys similarly how street kids worked for Sherlock Holmes.<br><br>He is master in disguise and specifically as woman too.</br></br></br>  <br>Where did you mean to post it?</br>  <br>Sounds like Aoharu.</br>  <br>I was talking about another anime that is being released today. The extremely gay manga that got changed due to it being too gay was Aoharu x Kikanjuu. MC was a boy at first now it's gender bender were the female MC dresses as a men.</br>  I can't fap to dat ass unless it's 100% sure it's a boy.  I got to say i like the MC. Absolutely calm in face of murder and thrill. Reminds of AssClass trap.<br><br>This might actually be interesting.<br><br>Plus its interesting how they shuffled the characters from original.<br><br>The edgy guys swallowing pills is Akechi Kogoro, aka main character of Edogawa Ranpo`s novel (aka Kogoro Mori).<br><br>The MC is who supposed to be his son. etc.<br><br>Like the atmosphere and music too. Did not expect much from this, but looks like might actually end up this seasons favorite.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Er, what? Aoharu x Kikanjuu MC always was reverse trap girl and 2 boys. And the manga is not actually gay and i expect will be liked by /a/ since actually have Subagemu and brofisting.</br>  <br>Oh wait, you judge an entire medium based on its adaptation? Can you be more retarded than this, huh?</br>  <br> He is kid of famouse detective Akechi Kogoro, running a detective boys similarly <br><br>Sounds homoerotic</br></br></br>  Its fun seeing all Detective Conan characters here (well, the opposite Conan has Ranpo`s characters).<br><br>i.e Personas "bitches and whores" inspector is actually Nakamura, Nakamura (中村 Nakamura?) is a detective from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. He appears first in Metropolitan Police Detective Love Story.</br></br>  <br>The only erotic you`ll find in this show is eroguro.</br>  <br>Oh, it's a disguise? Huh.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>    <br>So she's legit girl right? Picked back the fuck up.</br>  <br>No, he`s a boy. See actress tha played him in a movie.<br><br>Depending on adaptation, he is depicted from almost girly looking boy, gay boy, or just a normal brat (DS game).</br></br></br>    <br>HS release when?</br>  MC of the season. Happy because sensei died and finally something broke him out of boredom.<br><br>Total sociopath.<br><br>Thats kind of TANOSHI! i like.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if Seiji has a thing for traps.</br>  Ok officially one of my favorite this season, also production values are crap.  MC arrested at end of Ep. <br><br>In before he actually IS a murderer, since he`s a ruthless sociopath psycho anyway. Cant be cannonically, since based on known character - but would be fun if they fooled the viewer in anime and did that contrary to all expectations.</br></br>  Subs soon?  <br> Subs soon? <br>It's out at Funi, not sure why HS or other Funi rippers still haven't released it though.</br></br>  <br> The only erotic you`ll find in this show is eroguro. <br><br>If they showed the process of those girls getting plasticized, then I'll take it</br></br></br>  There better be scenes of Kobayashi dressing as a girl and kissing  boys   <br>I have the highest hopes for this. If only subs were released, so I could finally watch it.</br>  <br>Dont. Its not masterpiece - its cheap, slow and meh direted. Its only appeal is that it actually IS a proper mystery show which is rather rare today, sociopath trap MC, music and the fact its only story of worth at all this season. So to enjoy it has to watch it as reading a book - disregard all the cheap stuff they should have done times better if it was proper studio with talent and budget.<br><br>Its kinda like Shiki without vampires.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm a sucker for mystery, that's why I'm so hyped.</br>  <br> tfw a post advising not to get your hopes up raises your hopes </br>  <br>He's a sociopath?<br><br>Interesting. Picked up.</br></br></br>  <br>He litterally cums when thinking about disfigured bodies, peril and murder.<br><br>Litteral quote from anime:<br>- But you witnessed gruesome death of teacher and you can be next!<br>- TANOSHI!!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As far his psychologic profile goes, hard to tell if he is sociopath, psyhopath or anything else. At any rate he`s not normal.<br><br>He does not feel fear, disgust or seems like any normal emotions. Show starts with him waking up holding a murder weapon and seeing disfigured body of teacher... and smiling.<br><br>Seems his social behavioris fake, pointing sociopath traits. However the fact he gets excited, litterally getting high/erect, when dealing with death/thrill of danger points more on psychopathic traits - since sociopath shoudnt be that emotional.<br><br>At any rate, sick person, bored to death and Death and Murder being excitement in his life. <br><br>Lucky he ended up one of detectives, since with such character just as well could be a murderer  who knows, maybe that`ll be actual twist, though hes a book character so shoudnt be </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So what does this have to do with Laplace?</br>  Whats given is that we`ll see MC crossdress, since just like Akechi (his mentor, and pill swallowing detective here) he is master of disguise and specifically as young women. So it sure to appear in plot.<br><br>Also in novels HE is the leader of Detective Boys, while in anime he just mets Akechi in first episode.<br><br>The main villain likely to be https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_F<wbr>iend_with_Twenty_Faces<br><br>Trivia:<br>In detective Conan, most of his traits are given to Conan himself, while Kogoro Mori = Akechi Kogoro. But Kobayashi is also present as elementary tomboy school teacher, displaying his androgenous role again</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>   Those hips <br><br>There's no way this is a boy. This has to be a reverse trap</br></br>  Subs never. What the hell is going on with HS today? I feel like at least 4 different shows should have been released.  <br>He's a master of disguise.</br>  <br>No idea, they have one fucking job and they can't do it properly.</br>  <br>He shoudnt be yet. He just met Akechi for the first time. Akechi is the one who teaches him detective stuff including disguise. <br><br>Then again, its loosely based on novel setting, so they`ll find reason for him to crossdress. Probably being a bait for murderer.</br></br></br>  This was fucking awful, jesus christ  The silhouettes sound nice on paper, but the execution is awful and they don't even do it consistently. <br><br>But I enjoyed it, it's interesting and the BGM is good.</br></br>  Trivia:<br>Kobayashi first appered not in Akachi Kogoro novels, but in Ranpos novel "Vampire" which focused on  male male desire. </br>   [AU] Rampo Kitan Game of Laplace - 01 [720p].mkv <br><br>ITS HERE</br></br>  I hope Gakkou Gurashi is the high budget Lerche show of the season.    <br>Lets just hope Kirara is willing to shell out for it.</br>  <br>Well, instead of homosexual as in novels, they made him gurosexual in anime</br>  <br>Is that a funi rip?</br>  So the biggest mystery of the series is Kobayashi's gender, amirite?  I wonder what significance do all characters having Masks in the OP has. Just symbolic, that all they hide something dark, or will they actually wear them at some point (quite possible seeing the bizzare murders cases).  <br>Yes, it is.</br>  <br>He is male. Also that does not stop japanese from fapping to him </br>    heh, it seems MC actually is a psychopath - he hallutinates. The orchids visuals, is how he sees death and blood.<br><br>Note the scene as it appears, and then as "he sees it" i.e. orchids blooming around.<br><br>So the versions that follow are:<br>1) he is crazy<br>2) he is crazy and is a murderer<br>3) aftereffect of whatever drug he was drugged with<br><br>But seems butterflies/orchids are things he sees for real.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Unreliable narrators are great.</br>  Its obviously he is not the murderer, since his clothes are not bloodstained (unlike half the classroom) and he unlikely had physical strength to do that.<br><br>He is still crazy though.</br></br>  Seems we have an AOTS already  Not sure what suicidal teacher has to do with that, but we`ll see that later.  <br>H-how bad is it?</br>  <br>Pfft, viewers attention span is 0. If you read this thread, you should be able to figure out who this is.<br><br> its crossdressing Akechi </br></br></br>  <br>based Zoom Player</br>   tanoshii    The Human Chair <br>Fuck, I hate that story.</br>  <br>What the fuck is with those scars, gross</br>  I like it. It's not as bad as I thought it would be, and the mystery seem pretty decent.  <br> doesn't know murakami. <br> is shit. </br></br>  <br>What are you trying to say with this post</br>  <br>I read Superfrog Saves Tokyo.<br>It was okay.</br></br>  <br>Please tell me this is a girl, this sausage fest needs one at least</br>  <br>Its crossdressing this guy,</br>  <br>A fucking master of disguise</br>  <br>At first I thought that was bullshit, but it turns out they have the exact same eye color, so I guess it must be true.<br>He's on hell of an actor though.</br></br>  <br>Why? It is awesome. Also not really related to current ark other thank Chairmaker and Akechi having sofa "from previous owner" at his house</br>  <br>How the fuck did he change his eyeshape</br>  <br>The original character is based on Sherlock Holmes, so all his disguse antics are prominent with him.<br><br>Kobayashi learns that from him as well.</br></br></br>  Is this based on a book or something   super genius <br> corporate heir <br> harem master <br>What the fuck is with this cast of special snowflakes?</br></br></br>  Damn, she is cute.  <br>Better than<br><br> Im just a normal student until a girl fell from the sky </br></br></br>  <br>I don't see a she in the picture.</br>  The culprit is the friend, right?  <br>Nice.</br>  <br>Who is the harem master</br>  <br>This is based on whole sum of novels written by Edogawa Rampo (Detective conan bases its characters on it as well. i.e. Akechi Kogoro = Kogoro Mori etc.). There are many of them, and this show only loosely uses their themes (as Human chairs in this ark) and characters.<br><br>Theres many references, but just as Sherlock TV or Elementary tv show are different from original Conan Doyles stuff, so this is. The cases itself are new too.</br></br></br>   Having people killed around me is TANOSHII <br>I want to buttfuck this trap so hard, he's adorable.</br>  Why y'all watching this homo shit?  <br>How does rampo compares to doyle or other detective authors</br>  <br>Because it's interesting</br>  <br>Look closer anon.</br>   2 days into the season <br> MC of the season already confirmed </br>  <br>You probably should have spoilered that.<br><br> Because the twist is cheap. <br><br>The whole concept of human chair is already pretty stupid, so it's a huge leap of faith to go with it. But nope, it wasn't true all along, you gullible readers! <br><br>That is literally asking for your good will only to betray you at the end. Fuck that.</br></br></br></br> <br>I realize that this is an unpopular opinion though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He is Conan Doyle fag, i.e. Akechi Kogoro is his pretty much copy paste of Sherlock.<br><br>That said, he written quite a few famous novels and stands very well on its own. And for Japan he cant be overestimated - he is THE mystery writer.<br><br>Also his favorite writer is Edgar Allan Poe, Ranpo stands for how his name is written in Japanese.</br></br></br></br></br>  all murderers like the TANOSHII  <br>MC</br>  Jesus Christ what a waste of time and money  <br>Because all of /a/ is his harem?</br>  This anime has great amounts of FUN  Wow the writing is terrible. Couldn't even finish the episode.  <br>Yeah, not everyone can handle it when anime demands from you to actually think</br>  <br>His non-detective stuff is more interesting.</br>  <br>Guess you dropped everything else that aired this season that, because this is the best one so far.</br>  <br><br>Into the backlog it goes<br>How much of his work is translated?</br></br></br>  <br>That was said half in jest, but his girly looks probably will attract a good number of male characters.</br>  Can a boy (terms and conditions apply) also have TANOSHII?  <br>Right about now, his class honestly things he`s a creepy sociopath who dismembered their teacher and who knows else</br>  <br>Same, dropped it half way. The shit OP with stock footage and the character silhouettes didn't help. Also sausagefest and traps.</br>  Oh damn, this is actually interesting.  <br>you missed the fate thread</br>   MC was suicidal <br> Detective was suicidal in the past (or was that his old friend?) <br> Teacher either is or was suicidal/self-harming <br><br>What's with this theme</br></br></br></br>   draw a girl <br> with a very sweet girl voice <br> with a male protecting her <br> more cute than other girls <br> call it a boy <br><br>This is so wrong, but I like it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edoga<wbr>wa_Ranpo</wbr> </br>  <br>What other girls?</br>  <br> Nothing but cliché characters <br> Fucking 17 years old dude skipping school to help police. And he's chuuni as fuck <br> A trap <br> "Look I'm so kawaii!" teacher <br> The police can't even stop teenagers from entering a crime scene <br> MC is so special that he didn't give a fuck when he saw a corpse <br> "Yeah I don't think that a studend can kill his teacher" <br><br>It's just too much. That anime takes itself too seriously. I can't keep my suspension of disbelief. I think I'm literally too old for this shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Inko is that you?</br>  MC does thing to my dick and I don't even like mystery stuff  One version would be:<br>1) Akechi found the "chairman", proven his guilt, and killed him/placed his body in classroom - police had to play along since he has "special rights" as Imperial investigator as he said and which seems to be true.<br>2) He drugged Kobayashi and placed evidence against him in house of teacher (case he solved himself), since he knew about Kobayashi`s talents/observed him before - and now decided to test him if he`s worthy to be his pupil.<br><br>I.e. its all a game. Teacher was indeed murderer, but murder in classroom did not happen and Kobayashi is with purpose falsely accused to see if he`ll find a way out. <br><br>Pretty sure end of ark will be him pointing at Akechi and telling something like "Anon, but YOU were a murderer all along!"</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So it's trash?  <br>That's literally how it goes with every harem character.<br> seemingly everybody hates them <br> except the ones who talk to them more than 5 minutes and fall for them right away <br>How else are you supposed to self-insert?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You missed Lerche's previous anime</br>  Makes me want to rewatch Un-go.  <br>MC wasnt suicidal (MC is Kobayashi aka trap). He is suicidal i.e. disregards danger as longs its Tanoshi.<br>Detective (you mean Akechi?) is dieing - thus the meds, the song on music machine (read the title) and flashbacks.<br>Teacher(female) is not suicidal - its detective (see above) crossdressed as female teacher to approach Kobayashi and observe him</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much this<br><br>I'll give it 3 episodes though</br></br></br>  <br>I was thinking on that as well, but are you saying that as fact or speculation? I thought this was an original series that drew inspiration from novels, not an adaptation of sorts.</br>  <br>Those all seem to be pretty superficial reasons to dislike a show.</br>  <br>Please explain this to me:<br> A trap is a boy, who looks like a girl. <br>Shouldn't a reverse trap be a girl who looks like a boy? In which case the girl would be ugly as sin; and that's what you want?<br>Although every "reverse trap" I've seen represented in shows is just a cute girl who wears trousers and says "boku".</br></br></br></br>  My bet is on the vice-/superintendent to be the guilty guy. StuCo prez is the butler here, he can't have done it because it is to be expected of him to have done it.  <br>Yep</br>  <br>The grey silhouette classmates said that.</br>  <br>Speculation of course, but this being proper mystery, its full of hints. Does not mean we interpret them correctly yet - but they are there.<br><br>Female Teacher being Akechi fits the profile of detective who is prominent as master of disguise (also we arent told that in anime yet, its common knowledge of that character from novels, which all japanese know), hand cuts, hair being obviously parique and actual hair being dark (which can be seen), teacher - while having identity and relevant for plot not being here  , meaning its not actual character</br></br></br>  <br>It's tanoshii.</br>  <br>Hating the characters and a badly written plot seem to be good reasons to dislike an anime.</br>  <br> trap being used as a negative <br> literally being used wrong <br>Thank god you dropped it.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah if you have low standards</br>  <br>OP and ED contradict it. In fact, this adaptation seems to be more focused on MC and his relationship, rather than Akechi and MCs as in original novels.<br><br>I.e in OP vice- is the one facing MC in classrom where all disappear. In ED he is the one catching the "falling MC" from death like all other figures in ED. <br><br>If he were the murderer, he`d be not relevant beyound this ark (unless he is "the man of 20 faces", which i doubt).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> In which case the girl would be ugly as sin <br>Are you retarded?</br></br>  I'm glad saki stopped pretending to be a girl  <br>There's nothing wrong with those reasons though.</br>  <br>show me how high your standards are, anon</br>  <br>I would call a girl who looks like a boy ugly. You wouldn't?</br>  <br><br> murder mystery <br> trap <br><br>MY MIND IS TELLING ME YES<br><br>BUT MY BODY<br><br>MY BODY</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This fucking guy  <br>very</br>  <br>I would call a girl who looks like a cute boy cute. You wouldn't?</br>  <br>You don't really hate the characters themselves, or the plot itself, you mostly dislike superficial details about them.<br>Also it's too soon to tell if the plot is well written or not.<br><br>If you're gonna use those reasons then you didn't even need to watch the first ep, the trailers would have been enough to convince you to not watch the show.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No. I wouldn't. I'd call her ugly. I might like her if i was gay though.</br>  <br> Nothing but cliché characters <br>Those character can only be cliche for jap mystery anime since all jap mystery anime cliches in Conan, Kindaichi, etc. are based on THOSE characters and novels in first place. They sure as hell arent cliche for normal anime.<br> Fucking 17 years old dude skipping school to help police. And he's chuuni as fuck <br>Do you even Meitantei? Plus original setting was 30th years of 20th century, in anime switched to modern. Some rudiments of its left, like him being "imperial" detective, which is kinda strange unless japan won WW2 in this timeline<br> A trap <br>He is not. He is however canonically androgene and novels count as one of first example of homo fiction in Japan.  albeit likely not in anime, here he is just a psycho<br> "Look I'm so kawaii!" teacher <br>Disguised detective. Do you even Sherlock Holmes?<br> The police can't even stop teenagers from entering a crime scene <br>Do you even Detective Conan or any other young mystery fiction? Plus they try to stop the vice. Akechi comes since he has FBi/Men in Black credentials<br> "Yeah I don't think that a studend can kill his teacher" <br>Actually relevant, since this originally set in 30th years of XX, was period of students rebellion in Japan, violence etc.<br><br>Itt. you are just shallow ADHD fag. Probably amerifat and thinks Hyouka is Sol</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It seems playing mahjong wasn't fun enough  <br>Anon, you're already gay, and you have shit taste to boot.</br>  <br><br>And Psycho Pass was Kara no Shoujo 2.0, or something like it.</br></br>  <br>I don't watch trailers. And it's difficult to like those characters when those superficial details are all they are.</br>  <br>And Kara no Shoujo was Mouryou no Hako 2.0</br>   watching funishit  <br>Kill yourselves.</br>  <br>So everything in this anime is just rehashed shit from other works? One more reason to drop it.</br>  <br><br>I read KnS before I watched that, but you're right<br><br>right down to the head in a box</br></br></br></br>  <br>But those aren't all they are.<br>We have the detective, the assitant and the clueless guy.<br>Their classic detective fiction roles are more important than their age or if they look really cute for a boy.</br></br></br>  <br>Spoiler<br> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_H<wbr>uman_Chair<br>http://kissmanga.com/Manga/Human-Ch<wbr>air/Ch-000---Oneshot-?id=178592</wbr></br></wbr> </br></br>  <br> watching subs <br>kill yourself</br></br>  <br> watching <br>retard</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127496821 <br>Are you retarded?</br>  Did they ruin Edogawa Ranpo's stories with generic anime tropes?  <br> not watching it raw <br>kill yourself</br></br>  <br>CRAWWWWWWWLING IN MY SKIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN</br>  <br><br>The MC is a trap, what do you think.</br></br>  <br>but murakami is overrated and shit.</br>  <br>I don't understan the problem of some anons, it was a pretty nice set up for the series. <br><br>I didn't read any of the author original works, so i don't know how his mysteries usually plays out. still, the most logical solution would be mc fag friend, but it would be a nice touch if the killer was actually ''kobayashi'' playing a number on people expecting a faithful adaptation</br></br></br>  <br> trap <br>What a fucking waste, not a single episode watched and it a good contender for the worst of the season.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I'm sleepy and I thought it says "fujoshit"</br>  <br>Don't you know that these days anime watchers need constant stimulation by retarded waifu war or constant plot twists?</br>  <br>So this turned out to be 100% accurate.</br>  <br>Picked up for boy butt, hope it doesn't disappoint.</br>  <br>I know it's basically sherlock cocaine all over again, but when Akechi pulled out his drugs I tought 'here we go again with the Vicodin''</br>  <br>HOUSE?</br>  <br>But thats actully faithfull to how Edogawa wrote him...</br>  Are Rambo novels translated?  I hope Hashiba dies soon.<br>He kinda spoils the mood of the show, and his character is basicaly useless so far.</br>  <br>Japanese Detective House.</br>  <br> I don't know anything </br>  How long until we see Kobayashi wear cute dresses?    <br>So when will he go to prison?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PSa<wbr>asBjeJek</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edoga<wbr>wa_Ranpo#Works_in_English_translati<wbr>on</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>If your MC is a sociopath, you definitely need a straight man as a sidekick.

Thanks anyway.</br>  20 Masks when?  Only 5 minutes in and so much edge.    <br>The word is piqued, not peaked.</br>  <br>His interest could have already been present making peaked correct, I believe.</br>  <br> when anime demands from you to actually think <br>I'm not sure if you're taking a dig at anon's intelligence or if you actually believe that a show this shallow required any thinking from the viewer whatsoever.</br></br>  <br>thanks for correcting anon. people like you are a diamond dozen.</br>   Boy <br>Why do they do this?</br>  <br> Age 13 <br><br>That's how I like them</br></br></br>  <br>Cheeks like apples, anon.</br>  Why are people trying so hard to hate this show? Is it because of all the homo?  <br>I don't get it. He looks like a boy. It's like people claiming AssClass's MC looks like a girl when he really doesn't.</br>  <br>Because you can't take it seriously when the students are treating this murder mystery as a joke. It makes the entire setting fucking stupid.</br>  <br>They're both obviously kind of deranged, and whoever is going to take this seriously has only himself to blame</br>  I like the OP and ED.  <br><br>Well this should be perfect with a teacher that has cat ears. Even if she is in disguise, that is still stupid bullshit. I don't need plot twist at any moment, but I've read and saw many detective works and this is just not amazing at all. <br>I don't think it matters that much if you call him a trap or androgyn (if he is a master of disguise, trap would fit better imho).<br>I don't know why you are mentioning all these other works, but I won't like this more, just because other series did the same. The characters really don't grow on me at all and I don't feel immersed.<br>But I guess I am also just shallow</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It makes the entire setting fucking stupid. <br>Better stupid than boring, as long as the mysteries themselves are good enough the setting doesn't matter.</br></br>  Does this air at 720p? So I don't bother comparing with the upscale.  <br>Even the teacher thought he was a girl.<br>You can not possibly think he doesn't look a bit like a girl.<br>Have you seen dat ass?</br></br></br>  <br>It's good because he goes trapping later on.</br>  <br> He looks like a boy </br>  <br>I find it hard to hear the words "I'm going to exonerate myself by finding the real killer" from a 13 year boygirl. I also get the feel the show is a bit too fast paced for a mystery. A lot of the fun comes from letting the audience guess things out and figure out what the protagonist is trying to do. This ep they tried to push things along to establish some character shots and personalities. That's more a problem with trying to adapt written mysteries into televised mysteries imo. Especially when they are limited to 30 minute segments.</br>  <br>Kid, get out with your "babbys first animu".</br>   SO QUIRKY detective who thinks gruesome murder is FUN <br>I hate this fucking meme.</br>  Judging by this thread I'm not missing out if I skip this show.<br>Thanks.</br>  <br>I'll give it the old three episode treatment.</br>  <br>Is it a meme? What are some other examples?</br>  <br>I like it.</br>  <br>What am I looking at and why does it hurt so much?</br>  <br>Give it a chance, it's actually pretty good.<br>If you watch and don't like it nothing lost.<br>If you watch and like it, it was worth it.<br>Also don't act like you'd be losing time because we all know no one on /a/ has anything better to do.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They look like two pieces of warabi mochi covered with kinako flour. That shit's good but the flour gets fucking everywhere.</br>  Expected nothing and ended up liking it a lot, it was really entertaining.  <br>literally my thought process. first ep was nice</br>  <br>Muh dreams.</br>  <br>noitaminA is Animation backwards, hope that helps you remember how to spell it.</br>  Butterfly mom?  <br>I'm not sold on this show yet but /a/ is being way too critical of it.</br>  <br>That's an e. Butterfly meme</br>  <br>noimatina has been shit since samurai flamenco</br>  <br>I think /a/'s pretty critical of Lerche in general, they're not the best but they're trying a little now</br>  Who is the culprit?  If I didn't like the characters should I just drop it? Or will the story be worth it enough to overlook them?<br><br>I have no knowledge of the author or the stories this is based on at all, just what I have read on this thread. Would it be a requirement to know more about them to watch (enjoy) this?</br></br>  <br>They get a little bit better each time, no doubt Saijaku Bahamut will be amazing, especially with based Orange doing the 3DCG</br>  <br>Fix your colors.</br>  <br>Or you could just not use funi's shitty encodes and hardsubs in the first place.</br>  <br>I think my colors are fine, it's just that they didn't fix funi's horrible quality like HS did.</br>  <br> Is it because of all the homo? <br>Nope. That's the only reason I haven't dropped it yet, actually.</br></br>  <br>HS and AU are both Funi rips.</br>  I fixed it.  Well, that wasn't that bad. I'm going to keep watching, as long as the mysteries are interesting I don't care about the rest.  <br>You SHOULD care, sausagefests like this only attract fujos and yadda yadda more shitposting yadda yadda.</br>  <br>I'd avoid the threads anyway</br>  What a little fucking slut.  <br>What's with Seiji and traps?</br>  <br>my dick is the only reason I'll keep watching this<br><br> hopefully it does well and we get a lot of doujins, too </br></br></br>  <br>We can go deeper, edgier.</br>  <br>I assume some of it is just an indirect homolust thing. They can see full well it's a guy but emphasize that's he's girly.<br><br>The rest is just bad intuition. Target demographic was pretty easy to guess from a glance. It would be poor marketing otherwise.</br></br></br>  <br>Nagisa looks way more like a girl than this MC.<br><br> I'd still fuck both anyway </br></br></br>   super genius works for the government as a detective <br>That is so retarded.</br>  <br>I have no idea but I'm grateful for it</br>  I hope the real mystery is how that MC manages to have a dick<br><br>It's just mean to do that to such a cute girl</br></br>  <br>The trap legitimately did it but set it up to look like someone else framed them</br>  <br>Is it more retarded than super genius turns into a kid because of some weird poison?</br>  <br>The viewer.</br>  It's hard to tell if the trap and super genius detective characters are shit because they're setting up some kind of plot or if they are just shit characters  <br>I'm fully aware of this. You should not watch this anime yet, because it's only available as shitty funi rips.</br>  <br>Marche's ass</br>  <br>So far there's nothing more to them than being special snowflakes who think murder is fun. So shit.</br>  <br>They're pretty relatable for a viewer that enjoy detective shows and therefore also think solving murders is fun.</br>  <br>Well yeah, but this is a mystery series so the first episode could look entirely different come season's end</br>  <br><br>That's a holdover from ye olde mystery days. Holmes never particularly cared for his customers or about the things in his cases. He truly ever cared about the game, and since Ranpo based his work off of Doyle we have this as a result.</br></br>   great OP <br> actual show is generic anime bullshit <br>why is this allowed.</br></br>  <br>I'd be surprised if this wasn't the case, the series is clearly going to end with the trap being sent to jail to be gangraped for the rest of his life.</br>  MC is a girl.<br><br>You can't tell me otherwise.<br><br>My belief is the only thing that matters.</br></br></br></br>  Now i actually am glad Its Lerche with spoon budget doing that show, since too much attention to it turns threads into shit with trap fags and adhd fags.<br><br>Looking like shit, theres still possibility it`ll be not popular enougth, so that people watching it for actual story could discuss it.</br></br>  Has anyone said they're going to sub this yet?  <br><br>I hope it ends up having the UNGO crowd only</br></br>  About MC personality. Everyone assumes he is sociopath, because of his lack of display of emotion - but there is other possibility.<br><br>He is a detective genius. I.e. he reacts the way he does because he does not have time to panic - he "reads" the situation immidiately, just like how he figured out where Akechi lived.<br><br>So waking up with a murder weapon at crime scene, rather than scream from shock, he immidiately deducted the situation he is in and predicted how it will develop, thus had no reason to panic. Indeed, it is all for him a game.<br><br>Its shown he is not just excited for adventure and danger - he is actual detective/mystery fag, comming to Akechi house he immidiately assumes things there are needed for cases, knows how police work and how such things are solved (and does not care bit about him being accusing being sure he can find a real murderer).<br><br>If thats correct, that would also mean he already deducted lot more than was shown to us this episode. He could have not noticed that female teacher was Akechi and his scars. Should have knew things about the dead teacher, if he`s so observant too (which ironically, also makes him a possible culprit), and that Akechi planned to manipulate him to use as a bait for the real killer (that was the point why there was no scandal, and why he was arrested for 2nd time).<br><br>Still though, he`s not what one would call a normal person. But maybe, not a emotionless sociopath, just a person not panicing in the storm because knowing where lifeboat is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So he's an autistic sociopath</br>  <br>Sociopath is a mental condition, one of key points of which is inability to feel normal emotions. He`s at best autistic psyhopath, but more likely just shizophrene.</br>  I reckon it was the genius detective guy that planned it all and murdered the teacher. <br><br>It would at least make for a semi interesting plot rather than the normal "hard genius detective solves crimes with younger genius detective"</br></br>  <br>Mysteries don't work that way.</br>  <br>Maybe the real mystery is that it isn't a mystery after all</br>  <br>We dont know yet if the case it that simple yet. That could be the possibility if its episodic ark that is created just to introduce us to characters. If its something deeper however, like say Man of 20 Faces - then it will be much more complex and involve more victims and relevant characters.<br><br>I expect "another" or "9 niggers" like plot where everyone around MC is dieing one by one at least in one ark of the show.</br></br></br>  <br>Could definitely be so, but the funnest thing about these types of series' is speculating based on what information you've been given.</br>  So the detective is the new sensei?

Oh fuck this. Fuck this so much.<br>I can't pay attention to anything aside from the fact that I want to fuck his boypussy. Shit Kobayashi makes me feel something fierce. Something fierce.<br><br>God damn that is distracting.</br></br></br>  <br> Autistic psychopath <br><br>So he's got Asperger's Syndrome.</br></br></br>  <br>He is Savant, not assburger.

Don't share a bath with grandpa.</br>   not having a daily enema   <br>Generally this. People visiting carpeted houses have the common sense to remove their shoes if they've been walking somewhere dirty/dusty/muddy etc. Usually there are at least a couple square feet of tiled/linoleum/hardwood flooring at entrances of houses, so that there is room to leave shoes without tracking onto the carpet, commonly in a basket left near the door for that purpose.<br><br>Because the question of shoes its so widely varied/optional depending on the flooring of the house, the weather, where you just were walking etc it is up to whoever is hosting on whether or not shoes go off. For that matter it's also (at least around here) kind of an unwritten faux-pas to take off your shoes if the host -didn't- ask you and there was no obvious precedent for it, especially if you don't know them very well. Basically that says "I don't care if my feet might stink up your house and track foot-sweat on your carpet".</br></br></br>   nips thinking all westerners always wear shoes inside their houses. <br><br>Shit bothers me.</br></br>  <br>Their version of showing emotion in live action shows is hand gestures<br><br>when they're being emotional they put one hand to their heart and the other limply in the air<br><br>when they're scared they put their hands to their faces<br><br>This doesn't make the delivery better, it just makes you look like you don't know how to act.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't have to be grandpa. <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olest<wbr>ra<br>Causes anal leakage as well. <br>It's a fat substitute.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  Shoes off immediately when entering homes, sometimes exception when that isn't practical, like doing work in front and backyard and having to move between the two.<br><br>Shoes off in public buildings absolutely never.</br></br>  <br> not lifting the bowl to reduce travel distance and optimize your eating <br>fucking casuals</br></br>  <br>Japs have their assumptions of shit that they will never get over because they're all xenophobic and think they're better than everyone else.</br>  I've been to friends' houses where they insist I keep my shoes on and I just can't even fathom.  <br> not going barefoot in public restrooms <br>Why even live?</br></br>  <br> not rolling on the floor in public restrooms <br><br>OP do I watch it or do I read the vn?</br></br></br>  Tadaimaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  <br> not going on your hands <br> not being ready for the day when the rogue penises revolt  <br> pissing on the wall just because you've got an untimely boner </br></br></br>  <br><br><br>how are you suppose to eat noodle then? are you going to cut them into tiny pieces or something?</br></br></br>  <br>It's more like a hindrance and a pain in the ass to take your shoes off if you're not just planning to stay that much anyway.</br>  <br>You can't fathom what?

That hurt like a motherfucker.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  This thread is fascinating the fuck out of me. I live in Canada, and the thought of wearing shoes inside never crosses my mind, and I've never once been to someone's house that does. Reading about people saying they don't at their own house, and they kind of wait until they're told the rules when they go to other houses is just blowing my mind. Like, when it rains or something, do you just slop right the fuck into your living room? At bedtime, when you change into your pajamas, do you keep your shoes on, or do you have another pair meant for sleeping in? Do you wake up, and squeak your sneakers into the shower? And if you don't do any of those things, where the fuck do you put them when you remove them, if not on some kind of shoe shelf or other setup in your entryway?  <br>It really is more sanitary.</br>  <br>If I pull them off, would you die?</br>  <br>Then they just get dirty again.</br>  <br>This, seriously what the fuck? And who doesn't realize they stepped in dog shit?<br/></br>  <br>I have tile so it's not really an issue. I only request shoes come off if guests are going upstairs where we have carpet.</br>  <br> very ill if you try to ingest urine <br><br>No it doesn't, professional piss drinker here. Still alive.</br></br></br>  Well yea, I don't want my shoes to be jacked by some weirdo shoe thief who stakes out near houses and steals any stray shoes.  <br> At bedtime, when you change into your pajamas, do you keep your shoes on, or do you have another pair meant for sleeping in? <br>Jungle boots usually. Ready if you need to get up, not too warm if you don't.</br></br>  <br>That has literally never even happened once.</br>  <br>I think this is a worldwide thing not an American only thing, except for Japan.</br>  <br>Let me break it down for you. <br><br>In a standard house/apart/whatever, you've got a tile/hardwood area by the door/entranceway, that's where you take off and leave your shoes. <br><br>It throws us off, cause in Japan that entranceway is off liimts for shoes, and instead the area to take our shoes off in is right before it, in a lowered area that's typically the color of cement, aka not a color you'd normally think to take your shoes off on or step on with just socks. <br><br>Worse than that though was not being able to wear shoes in the schools. The little slipper things they gave us didn't even reach my heel.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>having those gross-ass squat-toilets in many public venues.<br><br>those gross communal wooden ladels for drinking shrine water.<br><br>public bathing in general.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this is actually making me mad as fuck. are aps really this stupid? <br><br>What the fuck do they think we do with our shoes?</br></br></br>   "No dad, I am no longer a pilot...

It'll either get a shot dub, or use localized subs that rewrite half the stuff on the wiki. And Central will remove their torrents.</br>  The novels are being translated, too.  I'd say something like<br> Hope you enjoy a bunch of people piling on your fanbase because they think namedropping it makes them intelligent and cultured anime fans <br>but that's all the LoGH fanbase is already.</br></br>  <br>I doubt it, but if it does I'm sure /a/ will start hating it.</br>  <br>This,. <br><br>Why the fuck would you want more people coming into the fanbase? <br>Do people not realize that more people = more shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>People with good taste watched this ages ago and shouldn't give a shit if this gets licensed and dubbed with some below average VAs.</br>  Hey at least  both Richter and Yang die.   <br> licensed <br>wat</br></br>  <br><br>It's a BOOK.</br></br>  Reminder that Oberstein did nothing wrong  Is this show actually good? I watched the first episode and it seemed pretty interesting, but the art was terrible and I don't want to commit to finishing a 110 episode series.  <br>The 1s 3 are being translated and then the rest will depend on sales.<br>Basically,  you fuckers better put your money where your fingers are AND BUY THOSE BOOKS   Yes, I want to have that series, completed, on my shelf. </br></br>  <br>2 billion tho</br>  <br>No it won't, because it's  boring. </br>  <br> Won't sacrifice the few to save the many <br><br>I hope you're part of the 2 billion.</br></br></br>  <br> Sentai <br>At least it's not Funi</br></br>  <br>A small fraction of the Empire's population. A protracted civil war would undoubtedly have killed many more.</br>  <br>What are the licensing terms? <br><br>Who licensed it?<br><br>Is it being dubbed or subbed?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He was wrong in keeping Lang from the previous dynasty.
