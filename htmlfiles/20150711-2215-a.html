[ It's already 7/10 in Japan, the date when Gin. the bravest hero of them all passed away.  <br><br>What about Itsuki?</br></br>  <br><br>I do not know who those non karin people are</br></br>    <br><br>The girl is Yazawa Nico from Love Live! while the dude is Heathcliff from SAO.</br></br>    What does /a/ think of tall girls?   tfw 5'2"   <br>Say hello to this 200cm miracle of the universe.</br>  I only wish I could meet a 6 foot girl  <br> over 200cm <br>197cm, only</br></br>  <br>But is she strong enough to carry me? This is a must. She also must wear heels so she's at a least a head taller than me.</br>  How does /a/ feel about tomboys?  What is the best part of a tomboy and why is it the butt?  <br>Her  personality. </br>  <br> why is it the butt? <br>Because they take squatting very seriously. But really,  is correct.</br></br>  Tombump  <br><br>Man, that was the best part of that manga. The other girls willingly the boys fuck them but the poor tomboy was legitimately terrified. She hated all of it and even cried from the rape. My dick was never that hard.</br></br>  So /a/, how do we pronounce this?  <br>Monkey a shit, that's how.</br>  Bake-mono-guitaree  <br><br>There is logic to the fact that he's still alive.<br>It's very simple if you just paid even a little attention to his monologue.<br>He lied.<br>He didn't die. It was a fabrication. You can't trust anything he says, and as the arc was narrated by him, it's easy to conclude that he just made that part up. The real question isn't whether he's dead or not, it's why he said he was dead.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw your native language let's you easily pronounce English and Japanese words. <br><br> English is my second language though. </br></br></br>  <br>the Kaiki Shuffle, anon</br>   Watch anime where character on the show eats/drinks a certain thing <br> start eating/drinking that same thing on a regular basis  <br><br>Does anybody else do this? Pic related, ever since Gangsta started airing I've been drinking Perrier at work on a daily basis.</br></br></br>  <br>I can't stand fancy water shit</br>  <br>American pizza hut finally has the pigs in a blanket crust like in Code Geass and Japan. Now you have to try it.</br>  <br>What do you drink? Shit water?</br>  <br>Actually, Non-brands (EcDonalds, Berrier,etc) have been proven to be AS effective at marketing the brand that's being avoided as acual product placement (providing the similarity is similar enough, which it usually is). No joke, theres a whole trade subsection of marketing that's dedicated to it, and providing 3D TV/film studios non-brand standin props for cheaper than licensing and product placement rates.</br>  I started drinking more Dr pepper due to steins gate. I'm basically hyper susceptible to marketing, I do it all the time. I don't drink alcohol but last night I was watching the first episode of S2 of mushishi where they make amazing sake so I went out and bought pic related (alcohol free beer).  Give me one reason to come out of my comfy S1-ending bubble and get myself invested in S;G 0.  <br> get generic polygonal shape pattern from internet <br> apply mask to finished character drawing <br> make new layer with pattern <br> set to overlay and 25% opacity <br>Fucking done. That art style isn't hard to emulate in the slightest. It doesn't seem feasible to use in animation though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>not surprising that there's virgins on this board of all boards. <br><br>to bad you don't have a kurisu to make your virginity tolerable</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For best girl.</br>  <br>WHat's she even like?</br>  <br>this is adorable but fuck it's making me feel lonely</br>  http://otakomu.jp/archives/277093.h<wbr>tml<br><br> Amamiya Sora gets her own photobook <br><br>スッキリ ｷﾀ━━━ヽ( ﾟ∀ﾟ)人(ﾟ∀ﾟ )ﾒ( ﾟ∀ﾟ)人(ﾟ∀ﾟ )ﾒ( ﾟ∀ﾟ)人(ﾟ∀ﾟ )ﾉ━━━!!!!</br></br></br></br></wbr>    <br>Thailand</br>  Please post more Amamiya Sora. Thank you.  <br>When did she go there? I don't recall her going there, only AFA Singapore.<br><br> If she ever went to Flipland I'd probably faint from happiness. </br></br></br>  <br>She's a less sexier Tomatsu with better singing but worse voice acting.<br><br><br>Her new PB was shot in Thailand.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I am.</br>  I want to commit a crime  <br>Sssh, it's OK.<br><br>Just don't watch sick almost-rape shows.<br><br>There's plenty lovely and cuddly loli to kiss and sniff.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> laughing_manwhores.gif </br>  I'd risk prison for the prismas.  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1pKgBm8Aa58mjB1hYhbK-VOPZsRBTXBuPBz<wbr>w8Xikm2ss/pub?embedded=true<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127808<wbr>792/</wbr></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br> You aren't going to get much out of a guide written for natives if you are still stuck on the differences between は、が、には. <br><br>How so?</br></br></br>  <br> feedback <br>Looks pretty good. I'd say maybe add a line break and indent/tab between the term definition and the examples like how it is in the grammar reference. Pic related for example instead it all being on the same line.<br><br>Also, if I've already started the old DoJG deck (not very far into it so starting over wouldn't be a big deal), will I be able to "update" it to this one? Or will I have to start over when the deck is finished?<br><br>Thanks for all the hard work.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  What's the best Anki deck to use along with Genki? Is there a deck that just has the words in the vocab sections of the book, divided by chapter?  <br>google genki I and II deck. Youll find one. Im using one now that isn't divided by chapter but they appear in the order they do for the book. The one I use right now has 2.4k cards</br>   I am going through it right now, I have 2000 mature cards and 800 young cards at the moment. It has definitely helped me with reading, I had to look up all the kanji when reading something while now, after using the deck, I can read entire sentences without looking up any kanji as long as the text uses non technical or complex language and as a result reading has become much more enjoyable. The real problem for me is that it is not helping the writing at all, it seems that I remember the kanji by their generic shape and when I have to write them by hand I always make mistakes or I can't write them at all, especially with complex kanji the image of the kanji I have in my mind is "blurry". <br>how to spot non-RTK cuck 101</br>  What would you do in this situation?  <br>Where's the party hard edit?</br>  <br>That shirt doesn't cover anything</br>  Can anyone tell me what are those?      So, I watched  read  all episodes and I still don't know who the murderer is. It's not actually Kanon and Shanon, right?  <br>You have to think and reach the answers by yourself, it's the point of Umineko.</br>  As far as Rokkenjima prime,  Kyrie and Rudolf  were the killers  <br>But I'm lost on my way.</br>  Finally finished it. It was good. <br>Does anyone have the updated 4koma picture? <br> Aoi didn't get her spaceship scene, what the hell guys </br></br>  Final worldline chart.  Who was best girl?  <br><br>Thanks.<br>Still mad about Aoi, she barely got any characterisation apart from being Subaru's friend.</br></br></br>  Apate visible in the last episode.  <br><br>Hikaru, Itsuki and Nanako.</br></br>  You best get used to seeing tears here.  <br>Hope his theme returns too. <br><br>Me too but only because the entire childhood romance is done so well that it literally manages to depress me</br></br></br>    <br>I'm not sure I understand. Which one is he supposed to be kissing in this image?</br>   No cute wacky haired boy to obsess over me  <br>Ms. Yuzu you'd better treat him like a damn prince when things finally settle down</br>  yuuya butt~  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87  Alot of the filenames above don't work and are extremely loose  Because it has some homo moments amongst the gang and the characters look camp. That's it really.  <br>meant to reply to<br/></br>  Who should I lift for? DIO or Kars?  did Narancia really need a battle cry? it's so forced   OP changes to reflect series development   <br>Haven't watched it, but it's the newest Jojo's season.</br>   OP plays during final fight.   <br><br>Kill la Kill did it, although with the ED. NGNL kinda did it, but I'm not sure if it counts.</br></br>  <br> Final episode skips the OP <br>It always hits pretty hard with SOL that had really cheery OPs and then by the end of the series all the energy has left it and it just slowly winds down without any build up.</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Qz7<wbr>okoAB8uk</wbr>  [ ]</br></blockquote>]
