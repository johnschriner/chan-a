[ whos ass would you slap  <br>All of them?<br>  I'm an indecisive pervert </br></br>  <br>Any ass in bloomers is just asking for a slapping.</br>  <br><br>Yomi but only because Kagura isn't there.</br></br>  Chiyo, but only to see her cry.  <br>Pretty much this.</br>  I'd fondle Chiyo's gently.  I would a Kaorin so hard. SO HARD  Yomi to make her self conscious about her ass being too fat.  <br>This guy gets it.</br>  Not the fat one.  when it leaves the anime Prison School???  no<br><br>and you????</br></br>  thanks, me too  L dies  ITT: Morons who are being random.  LOL this manga is so funny!!!  <br>If I may translate for the poor English-challenged Anon:<br> When does the Prison School anime start??? </br></br>  <br> 11 july</br>  <br> Not knowing how to google <br><br>¿Estás pendejo?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Acabas de poner "cuando sale el anime Prison School?" en google traductor?</br></br>  probably  <br>Sorry for bad english, I am japan.</br>   &gt;This scene in Kana Hanazawa's voice.   <br><br><br> prison school <br>that sounds like a retarded title.</br></br></br></br>  <br> <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;2 chan </br>  <br><br>So, I've seen images of this manga around and about and it looked kinda interesting. I was afraid it was some femdom garbage, whether the MC mans up and fucks some bitches, or whether it's something else entirely, though, so can someone elucidate me?</br></br>  <br>Just read it, obviously the guys dont remain the same forever</br>  <br><br>That's a hundred and eighty chapters, dude. I only have so much time. I'm not asking for spoilers, let alone in-depth ones. I'm asking for... not even the premise. I know the premise. I want to know to what the author is trying to appeal by constructing this premise, going on what little info I have. Is it femdom? Is it harem? Is it just for comedy? What in this series makes it popular and considered high quality? The artwork? The storyline? That shit.</br></br>  <br>Art, and story, that being fairly unpredictable ecchi-comedy with good character development and utterly bizzare conflict resolutions.</br>  <br> Is it femdom?  <br>Nope<br> Is it harem? <br>Nope<br> Is it just for comedy <br>Its funny to many, may not be to you.<br> What in this series makes it popular and considered high quality?  <br>The art is great and the plot is fun to watch unfold. Its a story of brotherhood and fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Alright then! That's all I needed to know. I'll get working right on it. Thank you.</br></br></br>  <br> femdom garbage <br>It's hardly femdom, MC makes the top bitch kiss his ass.</br></br>  <br><br>Awww yeah.<br><br>I just suppose they have to fight for that sort of thing, but it's okay if the conquest takes effort, long as it gets done.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>So I started reading and<br>wow<br>that's pretty cringe inducing.<br>Does it keep on like this?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ah, there we go. Good job Kiyoshi. You look pretty cool.</br></br>  <br>I felt the same way but go on, it gets better.</br>  <br><br>I was thinking that too.</br></br>  <br>you'll have to endure about 80 chapters of "girls beating up boys is comedy" but it does get better eventually</br>  Finished reading all the translated chapters yesterday. Probably one of the filthiest things I've ever read but also one of the funniest. I'm a sucker for prison breakouts and this is so ridiculous; love the twists and turns.<br><br>It's impressive how likable the USC became when their roles reversed.  I'm not into femdom or extreme shyness but I like both versions of Meiko </br></br>  <br> A kiss so erotic that in mind rapes the girl <br>Damn, is the whole manga like this?</br></br>  <br>mari is not likeable anon, stop lying.</br>  <br>She loves asses so it's a win win.</br>  <br> girls beating up boys is comedy <br><br>Oh god, I fucking hate that, though. That sounds absolutely fucking awful. Is it even worth it?</br></br></br>  <br>well, it mostly stops after the first 80 chapters.<br>also, the first 80 have great moments, comedy and otherwise that have nothing to do with that.<br>but that shit is everywhere at first, to ridiculous extremes and the "victory" against said girls doesn't feel anywhere as satisfying given how shitty they are/were. for me it was really hard to read, the great parts were great, but I had to read it in spite of the shit all around.<br><br>There are parts which are really rage inducing, particularly  related.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>though, just to add, I read it all till around chapter 160 in one day, so maybe I'm over-remembering my first impression.</br>  <br>Why don't you just read it already and if you can't take anymore just stop? <br><br>Jesus Christ, do you need everyone's input? Aren't you capable of making your own decisions?</br></br></br>  <br> how dare you ask people's opinions on a manga, in a manga/anime imageboard? You scoundrel! </br>  <br> Being too much of a sheep to form your own opinions <br> Not reading manga for yourself without having people spell out why it's good to you <br>Casual as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>Even though I hated Love Hina with a fucking passion, I did not mind this. They didn't deserve the extreme punishment, but they liked it so it didn't feel as rage inducing as Love Hina's. Then again, it's supposed to be comedy. Even the parts where Andre and Meiko's roles switched were just as good.</br>  <br>It's one thing to ask for opinions, it's another to read, stop to ask people if you should read on, and repeat. <br><br>Anons here have already given their opinions to you, what more do you need? Just read or don't.</br></br></br>  <br>It just didn't really feel to me as if they were enjoying it. Especially past the first meiko chapters.<br>Mari, when she started with the emotional manipulation went full irredeemable territory though, I keep waiting to see her brought down.<br><br><br>I'm not him, you mongrel.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Again, <br>I wasn't that guy. I just thought it's fine of him to ask.</br></br>  <br> but that shit is everywhere at first, <br><br>Eeewwww.<br><br> he "victory" against said girls doesn't feel anywhere as satisfying given how shitty they are/were <br><br>But that's what I was anticipating. What's the point with dealing with a bunch of vapid cunt's bullshit if they don't get fucked over even harder in the end?<br><br><br><br>I am reading it, though, and had been since awhile ago (it's why this post hadn't come till now). I'm just simultaneously posting in this thread. I don't see anything wrong with asking people's opinions, in any case.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well, main first arc villain remains as much as cunt as ever and even worse is co-hero against common antagonist in next arc, but the other two get enough development that their earlier transgressions are understandable/forgettable, to an extent.</br>  <br>Please read this page again: <br><br>Aside from Kiyoshi, they only really started hating it when it was obvious that they were being set up.</br></br></br>  Yeah, okay, this series is kinda shite. Mari and Keito in particular are just such terrible characters it's not worth reading. Not really sure what people see in this shit.  <br>You what?</br>  <br><br>I'm baiting in the sense that I really want someone to tell me what they see in this series.<br><br>Some of these bitches just need to get the raped and broken, frankly. I don't have time for this shit otherwise.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Some of these bitches just need to get the raped and broken, frankly. <br><br>Maybe it would be better if you were raped and broken?</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't believe so.</br></br>  <br>I, definitely, believe so.</br>  <br><br>That's nice.

I guess some people just expected more than a SoL with kissing.  No drama. Yuri is not about making out, yuri is about complicated relationship.  The stuff between all the kissing and fanservice was shit, and that was most of it.

The fact you shoved various instruments to take the place of vocals was pretty fucking funny (and even worked occasionally). A+, keep it coming guys,  <br>Well they're gay for using secure tripcodes anyway.</br>  <br><br>Guilty as charged, but I've seen people try to impersonate each other on these kinds of threads before, which is a pain in the ass.</br></br>  <br>Only Clarinet uses a secure one though.</br>  <br> list <br>Why would you keep a list of trips?</br></br>  This shit is worse than /jp/'s compilation album  <br>Classic Guitar and Sax also use trips.<br><br><br> Not keeping track of wannabe e-celebs </br></br></br></br>  <br>I was referring to my filter list</br>  Dat fucking Renai.  <br> worse <br>Worse is better with these tracks.</br></br>  <br> comparing an album of rerecordings to a mixtape <br>Well, I guess that's fair.</br></br>  <br>I know I do.</br>  <br>Sounds like an overreaction, but sure, whatever.</br>  <br> /jp/ album <br>I actually want to hear this, link?</br></br>  <br> not immediately filtering all trips who have no reason to be using a trip <br>It's made my life on 4chan a lot more enjoyable, that's for sure</br></br>  <br>Filters are for the weak.</br>  <br>moot was right, /a/ is indeed best girl!</br>  Imitation is really good, it sounds like the real thing except at a lower bit rate.  <br>moot?</br>  <br>There's an option to make everyone appear anonymous. Even then all the trips in this thread are harmless.</br>  <br> native anonymize filter <br> trips are actually useful (at least not harmful) for this thread </br></br>  <br>too soon</br>  <br>This is fucking beatiful</br>  <br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/c<wbr>az9uuvan03c5z1/%EF%BC%8Fjp%EF%BC%8F<wbr>+Music+Compilation+One.7z</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>But I actively want to ignore tripfags, not just make everyone anonymous. Although it's true that I come from  /sp/  where trips are generally a lot worse. Still no real reason to use one here.</br>  <br>Trips have a way of talking that is very unlike other anonymous posters, they play it safe because they feel they might harm their internet rep and make internet personalities. Not to mention interactions between two tripfags.</br>  <br>I don't know why the link came out like that<br>http://www.mediafire.com/?caz9uuvan<wbr>03c5z1</wbr></br></br>  <br>It works either way, Anon.</br>  <br>I don't even use a trip outside of this thread when I normally post, how the fuck do I even have internet rep.</br>  There's an orchestr/a/!? How do I get in on this!?  <br>Sounds like you have personal experience with tripfagging.</br>  <br/>  <br>Please stop being a namefag and read the thread for your answer.</br>  <br> 222 <br>Nice trips brah</br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's called spending any amount of time on any board of 4chan.</br>  <br>Uhm,<br>titanpad com/orchestra<br>when it's not down.</br></br></br>  Probably going to be redundant but it still lacks power from lacking musicians. <br><br>On the other hand it's pretty good, nisemono is perfect.<br><br>Still no pianist though?</br></br></br></br>  <br>A guitar has strings, r-right?</br>  <br>That sounds nothing like the trips on /a/. They're known for their shit taste and are hated even when their posts make sense, which rarely do.</br>  for the next cover you should have a section of rei clones  <br>We work with whatever we've got. Someday we hope to upgrade to philh/a/rmonic. <br><br>Also we have a few pianists  myself included, though I never record </br></br></br>  <br>The only /a/ tripfag I know of is Lelouch, everybody else seems to get harassed into oblivion.</br>  <br>It's tough to include piano in many arrangements.<br>There are a few that require a keyboard/piano part though, so if you're a pianist feel free to check them out. (Zoku Zoku from Hidamari and Penguindrum's first OP come to mind.)</br></br>  Alright, I'll try my hand at a few of the pieces that need trumpet. I need the motivation to start practicing again anyway.<br><br>The duet from Hibike looks fun.</br></br>  <br>I apologize, I am indeed a newfag. I read the first few posts then skipped to the bottom..</br>  <br>Mine doesn't ;_;<br>As with everyone else, drop in on the pad when it's not down and say hi.<br><br><br>Famously has piano, right? Pretty much the only thing it has :^)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but Famously isn't happening anymore because certain people hate fun ;_;</br>  FUCK WHY DID I LEAVE MY BASS CLARINET AT HOME WHEN I MOVED<br><br>Who /marchingbandfag/ here?</br></br>    <br> 9 minutes of narration <br> fun </br></br>  <br>It better be a Buffet or Yamaha, or you're a fag.</br>  <br>Wow, some of those songs are actually pretty good. Didn't know /jp/ was capable of something like this.</br>  <br>Hey if it wasn't for Famously we never would have gotten those vocaroos. You know the ones.</br>  <br>Yamaha actually. Nice taste anon. I have an electric bass with me, but I'm sure there are better players than me.</br>   Masshiro world <br>This is glorious. Wish I could play an instrurment so I could join you faggots.</br>  <br>That's me! I played bass clarinet, but I'm broke. Had to use a school instrument. Still have a clarinet, tenor saxophone, a few flutes, a trumpet, and a trombone that I've aquired over the years, all I can at least make a noise on. I'm really a reedist though.</br>  <br>Today's a great day to learn anon.</br>  <br>Fuck I'm jealous. I'm in college and all I've got is a low level trumpet, but I would probably buy a whole orchestra's worth of instruments if I had the cash.</br>  <br>Yeah, I think my most liked track is Ascend, which is sampled from Blue by SoutaiseiRiron.</br>  <br>Sure. I'll be back at my parents house for the holidays which has a pretty nice piano so if you have any requests feel free to ask.</br>  <br>My mufuckin nigga.

Music is easier than learning English, which they probably don't speak very proficiently anyway.</br></br>  <br>You can work without a keyboard, but a keyboard is definitely a good idea.

For casual playing, especially with popular tunes, chord charts are often more useful anyway.</br></br>  <br>This shit is bretty good.</br>  <br>There's a huge request dump at the bottom of our pad, this would be just one in dozens of other requests.<br><br><br>Maybe I'm just an elitist as fuck classical guitarist, but no guitarist who doesn't bother trying to learn how to read music is no musician.

Low brass is covered by literally one person.</br>  <br>You can't hear bass because we pretty much have one instrument in that range.</br>  <br>Good job.<br>Could you guys cover Uchuu Sekan yamato ?<br>The orchestral version would sound great.</br></br></br>  Terrible.   God Knows <br> Masshiro world <br><br>I love you /a/. Every single one of you faggots.</br></br></br>  2.3/10 BNM  <br>more like  treble <br>  because there's only one bass player </br></br>  Good thing I don't have an ear for music at all. <br>Just so long as it sounds enough like the original that I can tell what it is, I'm happy.</br>  I assume everyone who participated in Listen!! doesn't know how to play in tempo.  <br>It's not that bad aside from the accordion(? harmonica?) section in the middle making me nearly laugh up a lung. And that doesn't really have anything to do with the mixing.</br>  <br> dat guitar version of GuP </br>  <br>Can we also get more arrangers?</br>  I thought this was just going to be another /a/ Sings album, but this was much better.<br><br>Good job.</br></br>  <br> assuming </br>  <br>melodica</br>  <br> more arrangers <br>That might help us whittle down our huge requests list</br></br>  <br>It's a melodica.

I also have B and D tin whistles.<br>And finally, I have a Samick 'Artist Series Edition' electric guitar.<br><br>God damn.<br><br>I need to practice more though. I can't really use any of my harmonicas other than the first two and the recorders other than the Welton and Alto since those were previously owned by my grandfather before his passing (The Alto virtually untouched), and have smells of pipe tobacco in them, so I should probably try to get them cleaned out professionally.<br><br>Pic related: My electric looks almost exactly like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Sis Puella Magica is actually pretty good.

Then luffy and the rest will set off to wherever sanji is and then we will get glimpses of major players and old friends throughout the world which may last another chapter. So unless we get an arc on sanji's adventures, the next island should be 5-6 chapters away.</br>  <br> Doffy is cuffed and blindfolded.  <br> Fuji is gonna pull a Kizaru now that everyone is weakened. <br> A large ship appears from the horizon </br></br></br>  DOFFYFAGS<br><br>B L O W N T H E F U C K O U T<br>L<br>O<br>W<br>N<br><br>T<br>H<br>E<br><br>F<br>U<br>C<br>K<br><br>O<br>U<br>T</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the problem oda isn't addressing. If shank's crew is naturally on a whole other level of power than the rest of the world from pure skill and haki without powerups, and if roger was just incredibly strong, enough to be pirate king, in his base form he's always in, how can luffy possibly compete when his base form can be slapped aroumd by anyone worth half a shit, and he has to destroy his body or be completely vulnerable for 10 minutes afterwards just to get CLOSE to his opponent's power, which is still eclipsed by someone like shanks and even more by roger? He's relying on his fruit to give him all his strength when he needs to be stronger in his base form. He needs more training</br>  <br>Wishful thinking my brother. We're lucky if Mansherry fixing everything and the Rebecca family's future is only one chapter each, veryy lucky.<br><br>I do hope the crew splitting up leads to something a bit different, sorta like Luffy soloing the story for Impel Down/Marineford, next could be a mini-arc of pretty much every character who really needs to shine or just not look like shit(The Sanji-Hats), it's kinda perfect. If the Kidd alliance was after Big Mom it would be cool to see it with them, or maybe by some stretch of luck the Leftover Hats adventure with the Heart pirates.</br></br></br>  <br>Arlong is a fishman supremacist and loathes humans.</br>  <br>No DF, just an incredibly huge badass. Literally nothing "special". Basically like Garp.</br>  <br>probably the combo of haki and some broken ass devil fruit.</br>  <br>His nose hair</br>  <br>the gomu gomu no mi</br>  Found this in a grocery parking lot. Good taste or autism?  <br> Hancock <br> good taste </br></br>  <br> implying that's not your car </br>  <br>Seriously I was walking past and saw it and had to take a picture</br>  <br>Oda's never went without Luffy for that long, I doubt he would give Nami's group the focus for an entire arc.</br>  <br> triforce <br>Autism</br></br>    <br>Disgusting fish dck.</br>  law is a slut  <br>because fishmen don't fuck, the female lays eggs into the water and the male puts his milk on them.</br>  <br>the grand line is dangerous to SAIL, what with the sea-monsters and crazy weather, but once you're on an island the environment becomes much more stable due to magnetic poles or some such bullshit, so if you can handle the unique environment of the island itself you're good as long as you stay there.</br>  <br>No. The thought of copulating with a woman, or race mixing in general, would likely make Arlong's stomach turn. The man's racial pride would likely make the most hardcore Stormfronter blush.</br>  <br> Still no fanart of Shyarly teasing her manlet older brother </br>  <br>This raised a huge question for me. They went through the trouble of saying that Fishmen and Mermen and mermaids are different things. So are arlong and his sister half breeds? Or is it just kinda random and sometime you're a fishman and sometimes you're a mermaid/Merman?</br>  <br>It'd be like hitler trying to fuck a jew.</br>  <br>Yeah, both fishmen and merfolk have recessive genes that their children can inherit so two fishmen can birth a merman and vice versa.</br>  <br>It'd be Hitler fucking a deformed and mentally retarded half breed gypsy jew while she smokes a cigarette and takes a dump on his paintings.</br>  <br>Literally explained in the manga</br>    <br>Who's gay.</br>  <br><br>Ah dang. I don't know how I missed that. I JUST reread this part too. My bad.</br></br>  I like how the presence of half-fishmen and half-giants explains why some people are weird looking and/or freakishly tall.  <br> Someone somewhere in the One Piece canon universe got that snu-snu </br>  <br>I wonder how Magellan and Hannyabal got horns in their genes.</br>  <br> even though he was a D he didnt get any real kickass special powers, hes probably just really charismatic and happened to be in high stakes situations and everyone just assumed he did it <br><br>Shiki had mentioned that he single handedly destroyed his 500-fleet armada. I think he's strong, like really fucking strong.</br></br></br>  What does this face convey /a/?  <br>Im pretty sure we're gonna see sanji, and or what the kidd alliance is up to then end it with a cliff hanger, next weeks chapter they're gonna rush to zou</br>  <br>Because arlong only fucks top notch babes like his sister</br>  <br>man Den was underrated<br><br> Where the fuck is my merman porn? </br></br></br>  <br>My face hurts, my crew was useless, I want to be a real celestial dragon and go home, this monkey is annoying</br>    <br>hes a big guy</br>  <br> I'm sure that he will die after this one <br> Your efforts are futile strawha- OH WAIT WHAT THE NO FUCK FUCK FUUCK FUUUUUUUUUUUUUU </br></br>  <br><br>there's also the possibility to consider of the children of zoan-users.</br></br>  <br>so Bellamy is just a giantlet how hit puberty post TS?</br>  <br> children of zoan-users. <br><br>dont be dumb</br></br></br>  <br> A guy woke up and decided to fuck a giant <br> He succeeded </br></br>  <br> "I really don't think I'm having a good day right now" </br>  <br>So infidelity would be relatively easy to get away with for fishmen and mermaids</br>  <br>Never go full retard, anon.</br>  What would Arlong think of  cute  half-breeds?  <br>"lol gg it took 200 of you to kill me"</br>  <br>I think that would be more of an ng considering how above humanity he thought he was</br>  <br>She's racist.</br>    <br> One piece  <br> Filler  <br><br>Is your head ok anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>Christ this art is so messy. Not to mention the unnecessary amount of text bubbles. I miss his old artwork</br>  <br> There's something I forgot isn't there <br> Rule #1: Never buy into your own hype <br> FUCK </br></br></br>  <br>There's supposed to be a lot of text going on there as he's dumping a lot of info at once as you can tell by Franky's "I'm not actually following what this guy is saying" face</br>  <br> This hurts more than it's supposed to be </br>  <br>So how come all of Poseidon's kids are mermen?</br>  <br><br>Poseidon doesnt have any kids</br></br>  <br>Because it's the king's heritage. Do you seriously think his ancestors fucked some commoner mermen in the past?</br>  <br>He was always huge, back in Jaya he was at least eight feet tall.</br>  <br>Really? I thought he understood and was just fascinated by what he was saying since he looked up to Tom so much.</br>  <br>he got huge Post TS though</br>  <br>I think you have the right interpretation</br>  <br>Looks like anime just fucked up. Luffy comes up to his chest here.</br>  <br>Sittin down and crouching over, he still is taller than Luffy, he only increased his muscle mass during the time skip.</br>  <br>yeah I suppose so since they make Bartolomeo like the exact same height</br>  <br>Luffy seems to be further from the background in that image given the direction he's facing.</br>  So is CP-0 still on the island?  <br>He wanted to protect his friends more than anyone else wanted to protect their friends</br>  <br> Good thing I didn't make the mistake of underestimating him like everyone else did </br>  <br>Blaaar I miss old One Piece, shit like this is so rereadable. I like Post TS but things haven't really felt the same since maybe Impel Down. I don't wish to reread Dressrosa anytime soon, reread the fight, I might do the flashback that was good</br>  <br>Pretty sure they were leaving when we saw them</br>  <br>To be fair doffy tried going all out and couldn't possibly know luffy would have another brother and ally himself with everyone</br>  <br>That's on Doffy too. He had all these strong fighters gathered in that coliseum and somehow never saw that biting him in the ass.</br>  <br>To his credit he at least created a Spider's Web before sending his final attack through it. He just forgot that an enlarged version of an attack that could already send him flying across the island would wreck everything in its way</br>  <br> there's always a logical reason for phenomena <br>YOU LIVE IN A WORLD WITH MAGIC FRUITS THAT GIVE YOU SUPERPOWERS!</br></br>  <br><br>What? is it so outlandish to think a child conceived from a human and a human/animal hybrid couldn't retain some animal like traits?</br></br>  Post best One Piece music<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hv_<wbr>mT53eLec</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br>you already fucked up</br>  <br>Link unrelated</br>  <br>Are YOU going to tell him he can't?</br>  <br> will it be a squid? <br> or a kid? </br></br>  <br>It's not even so much a Hawaiian shirt as it is a sunflower shirt ...which is even worse<br><br>He also wore a blouse on Amazon Lily</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I can't hold all that shit taste</br></br></br>  <br>Because she isn't a slut and has pride. Not like arlong is interested in human woman to begin with.</br>  So who's gonna join the crew?  <br>Make sure you don't listen to that song he linked then</br>  <br>This is very plausible.</br>  Is Luffy in the top 15 of the world already? In influence or strength  <br>It looks like "beautiful lady with a snake" so it's fine. Fuck that Zelda shit though,</br>  <br> JESUS FUCKING CHRIST THESE SHARDS ARE SO CLOSE TO MY EYE </br>  <br>Nah. Everybody who met Luffy would be like "OH SHIT IT'S RODGER'S FRUIT"</br>  Who is "that person"?  <br>maybe hitler wouldn't have done anything wrong if a jewlet just gave some up?</br>  <br>Buggy</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5dl<wbr>VeiY61VA</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>law is such a hot slut<br><br>I want to see him get violated and have tears in his eyes but really like it</br></br></br>  <br> not the result of someone fucking a fighting fish </br>  <br>I want to see this crew's reunion.</br>  why is this thread becoming literally SnK tier? <br>this wasn't this bad a few months ago</br>  <br>They probably miss him<br><br>Do you think Law misses them too?</br></br></br>  <br>They definitely miss him. They love their captain a lot. Once Law goes, I'M going to miss him.<br><br>I find it cute that his crew doesn't call him by name, though. For some reason. Kidd's and Luffy's crews call them by name. Law's doesn't. Not saying that's a good or bad thing.</br></br></br>  <br> this wasn't this bad a few months ago </br>  <br>Obviously not. Why else would he ditch them? That makes him a scumbag in your eyes, I bet.<br>Or perhaps the fact that he left his crew and is using strawhats, and not his precious crew, in a near death attempt to kill Doffy makes him an even bigger scumbag. "Why waste my crew when I can use this dumb fuckhead's?" Winning!</br></br>  <br><br>Or maybe he came into this with a deathwish and didn't want his crew to die along with him. Noble sacrifice and all</br></br>  <br> it's been shit for a while now, m8 </br>  <br>He's half fighting fish fishman. Different from fucking the actual fish itself.</br>  <br>As stated in post you replied to, deathwish or not, but let's use this one's crew and get them killed, because kawaii and shit.</br>  <br>yes you moron<br><br><br>If DF affected offspring. there'd be little Mera Mera babies and Gomu Gomu children all over the damn place</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her relationship with Gen was amicable and he was a surrogate father to her children.</br>  <br>Sunflowers fit more with Dressrosa<br><br>considering the huge flower field there</br></br></br>  <br>Sabo<br><br>he's not going to want to let Luffy out of his sight again and it's not like Luffles would say no to him<br><br>Dragon is on his own now</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its been like this since mid punk hazard one piece hasn't been able to contain peoples autism since then</br>  <br><br>Many months ago people had threads on the chapter release day and then let them die unless there was something to discuss. Now autists always have to have a thread up, thus inviting constant shitposting and retards who wouldn't speak otherwise.</br></br>  So do the Heart Pirates all wear hats because Law has removed all of their brains?  <br>How many months? I got back into OP in October and the threads have been consistent since then. During the war and FI it was the same</br>  <br> Many months ago people had threads on the chapter release day and then let them die unless there was something to discuss. <br>no it was much worse with the jinbe/dellinger dumps and the freemium game</br></br>  <br>There's a difference between hereditarily passing along a superpower and passing down part of your physical appearance caused by that power.</br>  <br>says who?<br><br>what the hell is the difference between children inheriting cat-ears from the devil and children inheriting stretchy arms or the ability to shit fire?<br><br>And where ARE all these Zoan half-breeds?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because passing down traits of your physical appearance is something that actually happens in nature.<br>The power wouldn't pass because DF powers are an actual physical thing that's contained within your body until you die.</br></br>  <br> passing down traits of your physical appearance is something that actually happens in nature. <br> in nature <br><br>being a Zoan isnt 'natural'<br>It's a gift from the Devil himself. If one gets passed on then so does the other. There isnt a reason to split hairs about the types because you cant see the differences as easily in non zoans<br><br>Luffy is still physically rubber even if he doesnt look like it . Same with Ace, Whitebeard and any other DF user whose fruit didnt fuck up their appearance</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm tired of people calling one piece treasure cruise a freemium game paying money in no way enhances your chances of having a better team, I could login every day for a month and be rewarded like 30 devil fruits and get better characters then someone that spends 20 dollars. Do you fucking understand how retarded what you just said was you dumb faggot?</br>  <br>He is Luffy who travelled back in time, that's why he immediately recruits Rayleigh and also had the Straw Hat. He can hear the voice of all things and he has incredibly strong haki.</br>   Precure Thread   http://sakuramochi.mydns.jp/precure<wbr>/1draw-collections/date/2015-06-29<br><br>One draw guy posted too early!</br></br></wbr>  Kirara-chan...

Assuming I know nothing about their respective series, which is (are) the best one(s)?  So now that Twilight is dead what do you think of her character(or lack of thereof) /pc/?<br><br>Is she the most lazy and botched attempt of redeeming in the history of the franchise?</br></br>  <br><br> Assuming I know nothing about their respective series <br><br>Doki.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Max Heart 2, 5 Go Go, Smile and Heartcatch make good standalone movies.</br>  <br>Hana no Miyako de Fashion Show... Desu ka!? for that anime hipster cred.</br>  <br>Eas and Seiren's redemption and regret arc were boring and shit. They might have well have been brainwashed considering they became completely different characters afterwards anyway. What they do with Towa might be interesting.</br>  I might be slowpoking, but...<br>https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/ne<wbr>ws/2015-06-29/precure-magical-girl-<wbr>anime-1st-3-part-film-opens-october<wbr>-31/.89873<br><br>  Three movies <br>  One of which is full 3DCG <br><br>TOEIIIII</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>It sure is a good thing that both of them were brainwashed then.</br>  <br>I think Twilight's character is the weakest out of th 3 redeem Cures, but I like what Toei did with the redemption last episode, mainly because what HaruHaru said carried a lot of weights and is actually inspiring, and Kanata is an unexpectedly likeable and useful character despite how little screentime he got until now.</br>  <br>It's not even done yet you twat.</br>  <br>We don't even know what Towa's character will be like when redeemed other than that she still has some of that Twilight smug. Dyspear clearly isn't going to let her go so easily given the preview for episode 22, though, so that should give us some insight into how she feels about all this as Towa rather than Twilight.<br><br> I like that she's still in Twilight's outfit for at least a little bit, though. </br></br></br>  <br> They might have well have been brainwashed considering they became completely different characters afterwards anyway <br> What they do with Towa might be interesting. <br>Is this bait or are you being sarcastic? Because that's exactly what will and is happening with Twilight/Towa. Twilight for all intends and purposes died last episode.<br><br><br> Implying Eas' brainwashing was maggy whammy brainwashing <br>Did you even watch Fresh?<br><br><br>HaCha's ED people are coming back for the movie. At least the CG will be good and not the shitty CG we got for GoPri.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> They might have well have been brainwashed considering they became completely different characters afterwards anyway. <br><br>They kind of were. Seiren had a deception-then-brainwash deal while Eas lived the 1984 experience.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hacha ED <br>Gross. They have the most disgusting CG arms I've seen in all of Precure.</br></br>  I want to die  <br>FURE FURE TOMODACHI</br>  <br>Me too dude.</br>  <br>What I mean is that Twilight's, the dark princess', character arc is pretty weak compared to Eas and Seiren. The other 2 appeared since ep 1, and had lots of build up until their redemption, while Twilight only appeared much later and didn't do much at all, and her redemption story arc only somewhat begun last 2 eps with the mention of Kanata's missing little sister out of nowhere.</br>  <br> Did you even watch Fresh? <br>I watched most of it. And hell yeah Eas was brainwashed by her society. She didn't change into a completely different character overnight she spent the whole season working to get used to a normal life.</br></br>  <br>Actually, the shot of Twilight staring at Minami and her brother makes sense now that we know the truth about her.</br>  <br>Pretty sure they mentioned Kanata's little sister playing violin back in episode 13, or shortly after.</br>  <br> I watched most of it. <br>What does that even mean? You just stopped partway?</br></br>  <br>I'll never manage to understand how they managed to get brainwashing and redemption right the first time while all the following attempts are such awful messes.</br>  <br><br> Kanata's little sister playing violin back in episode 13 <br><br>They mentioned Kanata himself, not the imouto.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It means I watched up to Northa's introduction. So 37/38 out of 50 episodes. Which is more than 3/5ths of the show, hence most of it.<br><br><br>To be fair now if somebody is brainwashed they aren't going to act like their normal selves. Setsuna/Eas only got it right because her brainwashed state was her normal self.</br></br></br></br>    I'm going to marry Haruharu!  <br> there are people who really think this </br>  Twilight's only fault is that she isn't even the least bit interesting. I hope Towa can at least change that.  <br>Look at this shit. Look at it.</br>  <br>i love hime</br>  <br>I'm hoping she'll be sassy and full of spice.</br>  <br>That's what skinny little girl arms look like, anon.</br>  <br><br> sassy and full of spice <br><br>I hope she's full of smug. Like a shadow of that former brainwashed self still lives in her.</br></br></br></br>    Why does /pc/ never has proper discussion about the shows anymore? Even Livejournal and /u/ talk about the shows more.  <br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>looks perfect</br>  <br>hmtn pnkk</br>  I'm excited for when Bukki arrives.

Hacha had the best CGI so far.</br>  <br>As much as I like "show don't tell", a couple of frames is a bit lacking for the "show" part. If only they introduced her on episode 1 they wouldn't have been in such a hurry and they could have explored that a bit more. Gradually regaining her memories instead of bam! brainwash undone.</br>  <br>It might have been technically superior, but the characters looked outright ugly. Doki managed to have them still kind of look like their 2D counterparts.</br>  <br>How much muscle do you need on your girly tween princess' arms?<br><br><br>Nya~ruka.<br><br><br>Agree.<br><br><br>HaCha had great ED CGI, but Doki had very good ED CGI combined with incredible choreography. As a package, the Doki EDs were just incredible.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So what you're saying is you never watched Party Has Come.</br>  <br>Yeah I watched the most lackluster ED of the franchise, what of it?</br>  <br>So what you're saying i you've never seen Suite because that series has the most lackluster EDs of the franchise.</br>    <br>Suite's 2nd ED was quite good.</br>  <br>They were both amazing.</br>  <br>The first one was technically excellent, and grew on me, but it's not a musical genre that I was familiar with and so I didn't like it as much at first.<br><br>So I can understand how someone might not give it enough of a chance to enjoy it.<br><br>But the 2nd one was both good and very accessible, so it seems like anyone could enjoy it without needing to bend his or her musical taste much.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>By far the most sensual ED, no true little girl would fail to appreciate it.</br>  Hopefully Prince Faggot killed himself in the process and Princess Precure can finally be pure yuri again  <br/>  <br>He's obviously going to be the 2nd dark over-general, now that Towa is restored to being non-evil.<br><br>Haruka will cure his brainwashing with a kiss. Or with violin music, but that'd be a cop-out.</br></br></br>  Alice gives you this look. What is your reaction?  <br>What will brocon Towa's reaction be when her new best friend starts to make out with Kanata in front of her?</br>  <br>She will  wave a Miracle Light .<br><br>Later, she'll ask Kirara to help  ease her butthurt .</br></br></br>  <br> 3some </br>  <br>Well Miyamoto was doing something for Smile and Doki EDs too, but now he's also directing the movie.</br>  <br>Also he did the character design for Saint Seiya movie but that goes to uncanny valley category for me</br>  <br> Not familiar with disco <br>get some better taste, anon.</br></br>  <br>"Disco" and "better taste" are not related terms.</br>    <br>The sexiest.<br><br><br> KANATA! <br> TETSUO! <br> KANATA! <br> TETSUO! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They absolutely are.</br>  <br>Disco is the dad rock of dance music.<br><br>You should try listening to something from this geological era.</br></br></br>  Disco isn't bad at all.  <br>Closer to grandad, but okay.<br><br> You should try listening to something from this geological era. <br>Like... rock?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some of it is bad.

I thought after getting rid of Close in the first cour, they'd do Shut in the second and Lock in the third, with the finale being Dyspear. <br><br>Twilight changed things up and now unless they kill a general mid-cour, it looks like Shut will be defeated at the end of the third cour, probably by Towa. <br><br>Which leaves Lock + Dyspear at the end  unless the rumors about Lock are true, and he's the real final boss. </br></br></br></br>  <br> spoiler <br>I don't know, Lock doesn't really have that final boss feel to me, not like say Kawarino did, where it was obvious from the beginning that this dude was special.</br></br>  Why is she so perfect?  <br>Speaking of Kawarino. What's up with him? He looks and acts like he has a hidden agenda or something, even the old Dracula guy (sorry, I forgot his name) called him out on it. But until the very end, he was just pretty much 'muh Deparaiah-sama".</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127385673 <br>W-what?</br>  <br><br>Oh shit, sorry. I completely forgot to use spoiler tags.<br><br>Sorry.

I remember Kai airing after DokiDoki and HaCha.</br>    This was a pretty cool transformation scene. So that's what it looks like...  <br>Nobody cared about Kai.</br>  Boy, this movie was just bizarre.  I didn't think Towa would be this tiny.<br><br>Also I don't like that they made Kanata sacrifice himself. I hate this setup because now it's just going to be this lingering thing for Towa but I guess they're just taking the easy way out of development for her by creating a sad situation.</br></br>  <br> Towa <br> Tiny </br></br>  <br>Haruharu is standing on a hill</br>  What's the consensus on Fresh? Downloading it now.  <br>It's super silly, super QUALITY, but super good.</br>  <br>For me it was a roller-coaster of ups and downs. It did feature one of the fucking smartest minor villains though. At least for awhile until much later when he turned into a generic hulk smash villain again like the rest.</br>  <br>Best generals.</br>  <br>My favorite season. It's fun with a good overall story and great characters. just wish Buki and Miki got more episodes.</br>  <br>Why does no one in these threads know how a fucking hill works? Jesus christ.</br>  <br>It's QUALITY<br>It's stupid  in a good way, you'll find yourself saying "Fresh is so stupid" many times <br>Great comedy<br>Great season<br>DONUTS</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its shit</br>  I wonder who could possibly be Cure Scarlet...  <br>It's generally well-regarded. I like it a lot for its silliness, great supporting characters and cohesive overaching plot.</br>   mfw this entire episode   <br>Pretty sure that's just a carnival dancer.</br>  Best key frame of the episode? Best key frame of the episode.  <br>These fairies are 2cute</br>  <br>ZETSUBOU</br>    <br>IT'S YUI<br>IT'S FUCKING YUI</br></br>  <br>Is Dyspear Towa's tulpa?</br>  <br> oh shit, who's that boy with Hono.... oh. </br>  <br>No, she's her mother, pay attention to the show, please</br>  <br>Animelo isn't just a precure thing.</br>  <br>Can't she be both?</br>  What if sufferingfags see some screencaps from the next episode and invade /pc/?  <br>Out-of-stock henshins and attacks are almost always awesome. It's a shame how rare it is.</br>  Seems like I'm not the only one that found that haircut to look silly  Too soon, Towa has too little fanart  <br>The only stuff that's absolute consensus: It's silly, there's a ton of QUALITY, Westar is great.<br><br>Pretty much everything else, like how good it actually is overall, how well the characters are done, the plot, whether there are actual moments of good animation, that's all up for debate. I think it was pretty hilarious in bits, though, maybe even the funniest season.</br></br></br>  <br>That violin bow is an odd shape for a little girl's toy.</br>  <br>It's actually an incredibly common shape for a little girl toy</br>  <br>Did Dyspear buy her that underwear?</br>  My morning wasmade miserable because I will never marry Minami and make her mother to multiple mini-Minamins.  <br>Now I'm miserable too.</br>  Anyone else feel like the bond between Kanata and Towa was veering uncomfortably into shipping undertones in this ep?<br><br>Like, it's a given that Haruka gets to be the grand princess, but what if Towa gets the prince? That ... doesn't sit right with me.</br></br>    <br>I want Towa to put the incest back into princess.<br> Incest was a common thing amongst royal families. </br></br>    <br>My HarukaxKanata shipper's heart just feels rustled after this episode ... I'm a little bummed out</br>  <br>3 cures, 3 cocks. It just makes sense.</br>  <br>There's no incest in princess. You might have to settle for pisser.</br>  Its go princess PreCure good?, the last one I watched was Heartcatch <br>I have seen some porn of this guy <br>so I was wondering</br></br>  <br>hime pls</br>    <br>This anon also finished Heartcatch, and imo GoPri is pretty fucking good. It can bee predictable sometimes, but it's just so fun that you'll probably be on the edge of your seat anyway.<br><br>Plus, all the cures are likeable and Haruka is a great pink.</br></br></br>  <br>My god do I want more fights like this though.</br>  <br>Really?<br><br>My heart feels pretty good after this episode, Haruka and Kanata had some sweet moments and they worked together to save his little sister, I'm pretty hopeful for then end.</br></br></br>  <br>That was episode 1. It's the usual pitch when people ask if they should watch GoPri. If this is what you want, don't worry, there's definitely more.</br>  Hey kid wanna buy some condoms?  <br>True, it is good that in the end he did think about her. I just felt iffy because it seemed like Haruka was only special to Kanata because he reminded her of Towa.<br><br><br>Oh no, I'm not the anon asking about GoPri! I was the anon who replied saying they should watch it.<br><br>I absolutely love how the fights use the scenery around them, ep 2 was another good one. I just hope to see more like that in the future, because it's been a lot of beam spam lately (though they've been well-done too, don't get me wrong. It's just my taste).<br><br>Meanwhile, still tempted to put this on my backpack after finding out that it came with some scratches on it anyway ...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>is commie good for this, or do they use dank memes?</br>  <br>I suggest doremi. Commie fudges up the gokigenyou, and uses French when one character uses English phrases (to the extend that if you don't know French, you're fucked).</br>    <br>How thin? I would buy really thin condoms.</br>  <br>One of the thing I like from precure is fight like these  <br>so maybe I will start watching this new one</br></br>  <br>Shut up, nerd. It looked great.</br>  <br>You should, anon. It's a really good series so far. The soundtrack is pretty sweet, too.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=r9c<wbr>mLL8tfPo</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Anyone else get a Pokemon vibe from this? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd give Kirara my pokeballs.</br>  <br>"I'll eat it" here is too literal and makes her sound angry. It doesn't convey the cuteness of the Japanese at all and should just be "Yes" or something.</br>  <br>subs when<br>subs where<br>subs why</br></br></br>  <br>Back in my day we used to have to wait years for our Precure subs.</br>  <br> years <br>I would rather download doremi subs than waiting year for commie.</br></br>  <br>Subs are out already.</br>  <br>You know what I mean.</br>  <br>Hot.</br>  <br>Best ED of the franchise.</br>  <br>I want to bring Haruharu screaming into blooming</br>  <br>What is so great about that? It doesn't make any sense.</br>  Which of the Gopris has the best periods?<br>For that matter, what metric would you use to rank periods? Flavor? Viscosity? Density?</br>  convey?  <br>They're gross. You have to wait until they will end.</br>    ded  <br>Those eyes are conveying emotion pretty clearly to me, anon. You know. You just want me to say it. But I won't, because it's hazukashi.</br>  <br>Their mouths look fucking weird</br>  I think that every pc verse would be better if there werent any princesses. They are root of every goddamn problem  Nope, he is really not a girl  <br>periods?</br>  Shut has actually taste  This is going to be fun.  <br>I think every single frame of this episode is screenshot-worthy. If anyone hasn't watched Naisho yet, they should. Every episode so far has been gold.</br>  <br>Naisho is so good. The baseball episode is one of my favorites, like that's surprising.</br>  Funny enough, I remember having accidentally seen the first thirty seconds of this particular episode back before I started watching Precure more regularly, and was wondering what the hell was going on, and where the hell all the little girls were.   No fair! I wanted to be Meanie Master! <br> No! You have to be Robotter! <br>Heh, they're so cute. I love how they both want the villain to win.</br></br>  <br>Oh man. Now I feel like I'm about to rewatch this episode and I just watched it a couple weeks ago. Smile has some top-tier fun episodes enjoy it.</br>   The only way Miyuki will ever have bigger boobs. <br>That blurring is really annoying. Is that a thing they actually do in the original broadcasts or is it purely an encoding problem?</br>  <br> Smile has only top-tier fun episodes, enjoy it. <br>FTFY<br><br><br>It was in the original broadcast too I believe.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The only way Miyuki will ever have bigger boobs </br>  Daily Minamin!!  Oo, dual baddie. I'm curious to see how Smile handles this.<br><br>Oh, wait, Meanie Master was a two-part robot, wasn't he. That might make it less exciting.</br></br>  GoPri reference in Doremi?<br><br><br> less </br></br></br>  Best friends ever<br><br>Meanwhile, Happy Robo gets knocked around and beat up... just like the little Happy does. This is pretty funny.</br></br>  Yeaaaah, you had to know this was coming. Maybe there will even be something awesome worth webming.<br><br>It's weird, even though the episode has been really funny so far with plenty of physical comedy, it's still been hard to imagine getting a good 15-second clip out of it. It just feels like you're best off taking the time to just watch the whole darn thing, since it's not just about single hilarious moments.</br></br>  <br>I love when little girls control giant robots.</br>   OP playing as bgm <br>Yeah, they really had fun with this episode, didn't they. I know there's some other good stuff coming, but this is probably the best Smile episode I've seen so far.</br>  <br>I love when little girls uncontrollably pelvic thrust in excitement.</br>  Reminder to work hard and eat healthy<br><br><br>Oh man I said the same thing a couple weeks ago</br></br></br>  <br>Enjoy it, it is the second best episode of Smile, and the most funny as well. For me at least.</br>  <br>You should't say things like that anon.<br>It is too  cute. </br></br>  Didn't somebody used to say this? Was it Nozomi? I only remember being disappointed that it didn't become more of a thing.    Twilight this episode sure was disappointing. I thought she would have at least put up a good fight on par with Dark Precure or even Cure Tender.<br>Cure Tender's episode wasn't great but she actually fought and had a chance of winning, before she got purified and even Queen Mirage put up a hell of a fight before going super saiyan.<br><br>Hopefully Kanata becoming a new villain will be a better brainwashing/purifying story than Twilight.</br></br></br>  <br>Thats funny, I missed the reference back when I saw it.<br><br><br>I think you are thinking of Berry line of "I am perfect" in Fresh.</br></br></br></br>  <br> super saiyan <br><br>I need more of this in my precure<br><br><br>pnkk?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy cow, yeah, that was pretty awesome. It was like the best of each of the generals, from Wolfrun and Akaoni being big kids to Majorina's stupid inventions, and the best of the cure side too, Happy getting beat up as only she can, Yayoi nerding out, Beauty being awesome and the others playing straight man. There's really no way to bundle that up in one screenshot or webm, so... yeah. <br><br>Anyone out there who hasn't seen it, you really need to. It's probably more fun as part of the whole series, but I'd almost say it's worth watching as a standalone.</br></br></br>  <br>You're thinking of this.</br>  <br>Nozomi would change her tone and get real serious when turning into Precure. Also, her pubes got way longer.</br>    Sasuga Beauty.<br><br><br>I really seem to remember ditzy pink being amazed at how awesome she was. It might have been Berry, too, I just couldn't find it in a screenshot anywhere. Ah, here we go: <br><br><br>Thanks!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Monarchy rule is the cause of all the problems in all the pc universe. But then again, they're the only ones that stand up against the villains as well since Fresh's villain came from a futuristic non-monarch ruling.<br><br>It's like precure is trying to tell us something but I can't quite put my finger into it.</br></br></br>  <br>Beauty is the top fighter among the Smiles for sure.<br><br>I like Candy and Majorina in that episode.</br></br></br>  STANDING BY  Who was the best Y5 fighter? If you add GoGo it's clearly Milky Rose, who's like Moonlight OP, but just among the Y5 precure I think maybe Karen?  Or Komachi?   <br>Ha, no, for sure, I forgot about them playing the audience. Man, the whole thing was just really well done with really no dead space at all, even the whole set-up was quick, entertaining and to the point.<br><br>And Beauty just has a bit of that untouchable Moonlight aura going on, that's all. I'm not sure they've really painted her to be better than the others, exactly, just cooler. Contrast with Moonlight herself, who wasn't just untouchable, but very much supposed to be (and expected to be) 3 years stronger than the others.</br></br></br>  <br>I would assume Rin since she is the Nagisa expy, as well as the only girl that do physical activities so she should have more muscles and know more about teamwork, coordination, and all that other junk.<br>It's just that Rin seem to get the shaft for the most part of the show.<br>Otherwise maybe Karen but all the girls seem equally strong.</br></br></br>  <br>I think you get some sense of varying strength anyway. Sunny is probably the strongest, while Reika is the moist skilled.<br><br>anyway, the next 5 or so episodes after the robot episode are all pretty sugoi. In 39 it's time for Reika to be cool again.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, Mint utterly destroyed a general with nothing more than sexual repression and her punches, so I will give my vote to Komachi this time.<br>Stiil, every girl was around the same level in Yes.</br></br>  <br>I didn't feel like they actually fought as much as you'd think, though they each had their little moments of badassery, Karen and Komachi in particular.<br><br>My vote would still be for Nozomi, though, not because she was overwhelming (even as a Pink!) but because she got these rare 1v1's against Gamao and ended up coming out of them looking tough as nails. Pretty much the only one with even a tiny bit of that gritty FW feel.<br><br><br>Yeah, Sunny looks super strong every time they give her attention during fights. Maybe that's just what you're supposed to be when you're the fiery one.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Yasuda drawing lewds of Precure <br>This guy.  I'm looking forward to the next season of Durarara. </br></br>    Which Cure would make the best homemade tendies?  <br>Tender. Duh.</br>  <br>Yeah I'm thinking about Mint still too. And I agree they are all pretty close.<br><br><br>But now I might just have to agree with this anon and go with one of my favorite pinks. Damn she's kickin ass there. Komachi might have the most potential destructive power. Lemonaide has the huge control advantage. I think Karen's intelligence and her range based attacks make her especially dangerous in a fight, and Rin's being based on the sport she plays too as well as her physical endurance. Fights against generals just kick ass though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like how Nozomi shoves Urara away. Like bitch cute time was 10 minutes ago, we kickin ass now.</br>  <br>Yeah, arguing latent power (like Komachi's) is such a tough one, especially with that whole notion that Precure can be as powerful as they need to be. Obviously she's crazy enough that you wouldn't want to mess with her, but I think Nozomi is the real threat.<br><br><br>Heh, I took it as being protective, but sure.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She was protecting Coco though, but yeah. Didn't notice her holding him at first.</br>    <br><br>Maybe it is that Nozomi is the most balanced out of the five, and all others have their area of expertise.<br>Yes5 really have the most balanced team, didn't it?</br></br></br>    <br>Iona bullying is such a perfect thing.</br>  <br> Sasorina <br> Dark Precure <br> Professor Tsukikage <br><br>Stop reopening my wounds ...</br></br></br></br></br>  Precure one-hour draw:<br><br>http://sakuramochi.mydns.jp/precure<wbr>/1draw-collections/date/2015-06-30<br><br>It's a lovely day for a lovely cat. Today's theme is Hummy!</br></br></wbr></br></br>  Today's theme is ded.  A cat is fine too.      <br>She was such a cutie.</br>  <br>deshou deshiou deshou?!</br>      <br>I wonder how many times she sold sold sold her body to the teachers?</br>  <br><br>Somebody at Toei had a hard-on for these two.</br></br>  <br>Zero times. Her body is an art object.</br>  <br>Yeah, a Picasso painting!</br>  <br>Three times most likely.</br>  <br>Brain is such a good Porkroasto.</br>  <br>But Medic's the best Hemorrhoido.</br>  \<br>27, because it's three times three times three times.</br>  <br><br> Love <br> not using Paizuri attacku! </br></br></br>  <br>Their balance was very heavy-handed, like exactly the same number of focus episodes in exactly the same order, spotlights that always hit all five of them, that sort of thing. That doesn't necessarily make it bad, but it's a little more jarring than, say, Fresh, where there's a fair amount of balance but it's handled more softly.<br><br><br>Can you really blame them?  They also loved Akane. </br></br></br></br>    <br>That looks like the discount kig show.</br>  <br>Kyoko and Natsuko from episode 14. They were in one of the regular stage shows.</br>      <br>The new kig is out already?<br><br>Has it been in any shows yet?</br></br></br>  Can Kumeta ever not throw in references everywhere?  <br>Sadly no it's just from advertising for the upcoming musical I think<br><br>http://asahi.co.jp/event/abcspecial<wbr>/precure/</wbr></br></br></br>  This is probably a retard question, but I noticed period guy has a new comic on his pixiv and was wondering if the people who usually post them here manually put the panels into one image or what.  <br><br>He posts it whole elsewhere.</br></br>  <br>But they switched up the order and occasionally gave the same girl two episodes in a row.</br>  <br>Precure is a good far right anime so he likes it.</br>  <br>Kumeta seems like an equal-opportunity offender to me.</br>  Hummy is super excited because today's one draw is all about her! This lovely cat is trying her best to keep her best friend in check. Do your best!      <br>That non-SD CG Haruka is freaky.</br>  <br><br>Now this is Unprecure.</br></br>  <br>she looks like a defanged vampire</br>   MFW my 2ds is hacked <br>There any good precure game or othee mahou shoujo on 3ds?</br>      <br>Pokemon?</br>  <br><br>For girls, anon. Pokemon for girls.</br></br>  <br><br>I think they overdid the effects. Bloom lighting, more lens flares than star trek, pretty thick lineart on the cel shading, specular reflections etc. etc.<br>The wind effect on the grass is nice though.<br><br>They toned it down again for the NS3 ED.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>By best CGI I was mostly referring to the form changes and Party Has Come. I don't mind Precure Memory but you're right about how it could do better.</br>    Spoilers are out  <br>That's from like 3 weeks ago.

But really, I don't think Kishimoto would ever go there... unfortunately. <br><br><br>Why is mangastream filled with such shit taste</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127413963 <br>Kishi really needs some balls</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127413963 <br>That was bs you fag, even nips in 2chan were laughing at it.</br>  <br> wants to make her Sasuke's love interest <br> puts her in the same family as Naruto  <br>what the hell man</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127413963 <br>I can pinpoint the moment he tried the NaruKarin thing. <br><br>I hate this popularity stuff</br></br></br>  <br>I got it... Blood Transfusion</br>  <br>So, this the power of no editors</br>  Dont forget to report these threads  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127413963 <br>Do people still fall for bs interviews?</br>  <br>if you feel like i do, you just really want sasusaku fans to go full meltdown<br><br>also...i guess karin teaching her daughter salad how to autopsy corpses and hide lock pick sets all over her body is a nice image.</br></br></br>  <br> [pottery intensifies] <br><br><br>That could work. Somehow.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, I don't keep up with these things very much. I'll just delete it so it doesn't get quoted by idiots looking for straws.</br></br>  <br>I'm surprised sakura has fans. How the hell people could like her?</br>  <br>I can't stop crying when thinking of what could have been if Kishimoto didn't have to mantain Sakura and Hinata around. Well not Hinata because she's barely relevant and 10 chapters out of the entire serialization are about her but still. <br><br>Makes me wonder if Naruto could've been a really good manga.</br></br></br>  <br>Chakra chains are the shit and you want SScucks to be salty and butthurt until the end of time.<br><br>Also because nobody wants Pink Shit 2.0 from Salad.</br></br></br>  <br>That was some random speculation from the Boruto movie site having a countdown timer for a secret to be revealed some time around July 28th and somehow the first thing that was conjured up was a kid for Sasuke and Sakura.</br>  <br>She's main girl. <br><br>People like main girl, doesn't matter how she is. Look at Taiga in toradora</br></br></br>  <br> Skrillex will never be your waifu </br>  <br><br>Amifag please</br></br>  <br> K <br> A <br> R <br> I <br> N <br><br> I <br> S <br><br> M <br> O <br> M </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying taiga wasn't best girl <br>Amifags still mad</br></br>   karin is mom <br> when salad meets her shes pregnant with sasuke brat #5 and there are a bunch of salad looking siblings running around bc sasuke's dick never gets a break  <br><br>i'm only dreaming though, i just want ss fans to be as mad as possible.</br></br></br>  <br><br>THE HEART<br><br>NO EDITORS</br></br></br></br>  <br>Adult Karin is a qt.</br>  Has evil posted any spoilers apart from this? she did say she wanted to troll the ending, so she could still be lying.  The real spoilers will be out in 24 hours, right?  <br><br> she literally is wearing Sarada's school girl outfit </br></br>  <br>Rai is the most reliable but doesn't know Japanese so he can only tell us his own interpretation of the panels.</br>  <br> I don't know if it's legit, but there was an interview with Kishimoto leaked a few months back where Kishi said if it were up to him, Sasuke would have ended up with Karin, but the problem was Karin's lack of popularity compared to Sakura. <br>Kishi probably wanted Salad to have Chakra Chains. So maybe this is his roundabout way to get it?</br></br>  <br>Holy fuck, kishi is a confirmed faggot.</br>  Someone 'cracked' Evil's message.<br><br>Collect the first letter of each sentence. <br>Then you get the letters: kaarihinpitsmgonm<br><br>When you unscramble it, it reads<br>Spoiler: <br>Ha, Karin isn't mom, pig!<br><br><br>No I'm not kidding either, that's really what it reads when you unscramble it. <br><br>Bolt is best girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Karin <br> loli Karin <br>It's not even up for debate in this panel.</br></br></br>  <br>Imagine if Hinata got main character development, that shit would have been tight.<br>Also karin replaces sakura in basically every way and does it better. Shame kishi has no idea how to write girl characters, though.</br></br>  <br>Because Pink is a shit character and is a shit mom to Salad?</br>  <br>If Salad has chakra chains then that just made pic related a whole lot more interesting.<br><br> Also doujin potential just went up by a factor of ten. </br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Come on, you really think she's that smart?</br></br></br>  What if Sarada is Karin<br>/kubo</br>  <br> Because Pink is a shit character and is a shit mom to Salad? <br>Also because she has nothing to offer genetically. She can teach Salad everything she knows skill wise, but genetically Sakura had nothing to give.</br></br>  <br>Fucking this, cuckura has shit tier genes.</br>  <br>Why is it team taka stayed super hot but the konoha ninja look awful? cus hot damn, Karin has become hottest girl.</br>  <br>Orochimaru</br>  <br>Best health care plan</br>  <br>That could become the default answer for a lot of things in this series</br>  <br><br> Karin is Sakura's daughter <br><br>ultimate cuckold</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Considering the kind of "development" that the main characters received, Hinata's irrelevance is almost a blessing in disguise.</br></br>  <br> Why is it team taka stayed super hot but the konoha ninja look awful? cus hot damn, Karin has become hottest girl. <br>Because Oro had been researching eternal youth for decades, and there is probably enough discoveries that are safe enough to use on the other members of the lab by now.</br></br>  <br> Combo Ougi with Boruto <br><br>SHIP CONFIRMED! HYUUGA EUGENICS CONSIPRACY PART 2!</br></br></br>  Sarada is Karin's clone as saskue and sakura's adoptive child  <br>It's too obvious, but the again she's a evil troll so who knows.<br><br>Personally, the self-destruct, Orochimaru arriving, and another Chouchou joke about her dad, now with Shin, all sound possible, so whatever.</br></br></br>  <br> Also doujin potential just went up by a factor of ten <br> Uzumaki stamina  <br> Uchiha perseverance with just a dash of DARKNESS-induced crazy <br> Raiton for electroshock play <br> chakra chain BDSM <br> kinky bite play that heals him so he can go even longer <br> Shadow Clones </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>stop spreading shitty tumblr lies, faggot</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>Yet she's the strongest girl BY FAR in the series (behind Kaguya and probably Tsunade/Mei) <br>All of those have magical bloodline superpowers. <br><br>Sakura is great in that point anon, nobody can deny that. I don't like her, but she has my respect in the fact that she can claim she punched the shit out of kaguya.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The person posted who "cracked" the code missed an I at the beginning of a sentence and threw in a G from genjutsu which did not begin any sentence, they're an idiot.</br>  <br>It was fake.</br>  <br>AND* there's the fact</br>  <br> implying there was ever any doubt </br>  <br>Temari gets shit done.</br>  What if Sarada is product of Sasuke attempting to create shadow clone to pleasure himself, but he's too dark that shadow clone literally become real?  <br>that was done by a ss fag, there was no g at the start of any sentence<br><br><br>self insert</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her punching kaguya was bullshit and you know it.</br>  <br> It's too obvious, but the again she's a evil troll so who knows. <br><br>It's possible she made it obvious after saying "What if I said that Sakura is the biological mother?" But that's assuming she's encoding anything.</br></br></br>  <br>Sure but can you deny the fact that she's stronger than any other kunoichi aside from the ones I said.<br><br><br>Yeah I really like Temari but she is weaker than Sakura. She's the second strongest I think tho.</br></br></br></br>   <br>league term for killing the all the enemy team on your own</br>  Apparently the last time Evil put a bunch of fake spoilers and a real one. The real one turned out to be "Obito teleports back from the dead"   tfw karin probably wont chakra chain swing in like spiderman, make out with sasuke and steak salad's heart in order to ruin the sasusaku fans day like i want her tofeels bad, man    Sarada is actually a experiment of Orochimaru using Karin egg and   Madara's  DNA<br> But he decides to stop it becuase Combining Uzumaki and Uchiha only seems to produce girls in 100% of the experiments <br>rate theory guys</br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Even more shit about Sasuke?</br>  <br><br> Still believing that shit <br><br>Fuck off, Fujoshi, just because you are projecting your failed homo ship into these kids, it won't make it any more canon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I imagine Sakura punching Kaguya as two neckbeards heavily involved in a DnD game, playing Sasuke and Naruto respectively.<br><br>However, one of the neckbeards has a girlfriend, who doesn't really care about stats or roleplaying but got dragged to the game.<br><br>Sakura's player rolled a natural 20 in the end of the campaign, then rolled a natural 20 on the confirmation, and another natural 20 after that.<br><br>Hence, Kaguya got punked by "that guy"'s girlfriend. RNG too stong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hetero ship <br> fujo <br>Fujoshits hate Bort and Salad precisely because they see it as Kishi "giving in" to the hetero, anon.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Still pushing the eugenics meme. </br></br></br>  <br>Sakura got that hard work going for her, which is pretty neat. However in terms of defending against her clumsy but powerful punches, kunoichi who are either long range, can counter abilities based on precision chakra flow or just have superior dodge/stamina like Temari, Hinata and Karin would all have the distinct advantage.</br>  <br>Oh c'mon there's no doubt Kishimoto is doing that. He's so fucking predictable</br>  <br>Wut? What homo shit? We are talking about Kaguya 2.0 as possible MC for Naruto GT.</br>  <br> From "cool bad boy" to deadbeat father that goes missing for 12 years and doesn't even recognize his own daughter </br>  <br> "The DNA of the Number 1 Unpredictable (Ninja, Naruto's nickname) is strong (in me)!!!" <br> Gaiden is all about cloning and genetics <br> implying it's just a meme anymore </br></br></br>  <br>Eugenics has staying power, anon. The series is built on gene shit, so it's just to easy to joke about it.</br>  <br>Karin could Seal her for a little while but that's it, she has no way of harming Sakura and then would eat teeth soup.<br><br>Hinata stands no chance, she hits the points and they regenerate. Sakura Punches hard and breaks her skull. <br>Temari cuts her but she regenerates, moves forward and punches her really hard.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The real one turned out to be "Obito teleports back from the dead" <br><br>This is likely true.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Implying Boruto isn't the walking flagship NaruSasu children <br><br> Implying they aren't into BoruSasu already </br></br></br></br>  <br>DNA is the name of a band.</br>  <br>You don't regenerate points nimrod. Hell you can't do anything because your chakra is sealed off.</br>  <br> liking skrillex </br>  <br> failed homo ship <br>From what it seems Naruto and Sasuke are going to spend nearly all of Naruto GT either with each other or babysitting the other's kid.</br></br>  <br>That's the beauty of this series, it's so fucking stupid literally anything can be a spoiler</br>  <br> she hits the points and they regenerate <br>she heals chakra points and makes chakra control unstable, which means no regeneration</br></br>  <br>The chakra using Byakugo doesn't flow normally idiot. <br><br>Stop wanking Hinata</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. Naruto ends up kidnapped. He can't babysit anyone. Plus Hokage so even less time for him.</br>  <br>That just means the eugenics meme failed given that Boruto doesn't consider his Hyuga genes to be worth shit.</br>  Just one more day and I can post my collection of cringeworthy "KARIN IS DEFINITELY THE MOTHER" posts in order to make fun of all you gullible fools who fell for Kishi's ruse. <br><br>Though many will deny it, there is no such thing as a person that does not get a smug satisfaction rush out of the simple act of saying "told you so".</br></br>  <br> Hinata stands no chance, she hits the points and they regenerate <br> and they regenerate <br> chakra flow is cut off <br> regenerate </br></br></br></br>  <br>He spent the entire gaiden babysitting Sarada.</br>  <br>She posted 5 spoilers then stopped, with KARIN IS MOM being last, so that might be it.</br>  <br>Go ahead and post them already, it's obviously a ruse.</br>  <br>And when Karin is the mom, we'll never see you again because you'll be too ashamed to hear it yourself</br>  <br>Are you stupid? Byakugo doesn't work like that. It's the fucking seal that's giving the power up.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure everyone but one guy is expecting Sakura to be the mother. Whether they wish for it to be otherwise or not.</br>  <br> Naruto is actually another "We are actually inside a MMO" story </br>  <br> Boruto doesn't consider his Hyuga genes to be worth shit <br> what is Lightning nature </br></br>  <br>But Kakashi's friendship-powered intangible perfect Susanoo from beyond the grave done with no sharingan wasn't?</br>  <br>There is no evidence to support this</br>  <br>chakra points can't be regenerated once sealed off, we know this because Naruto got his points sealed off before and couldn't regenerate to get them to open up again, instead he needed to force them open with Kyuubi's chakra. <br><br>Sakura's ability to regenerate requires her to be able to use her chakra, and Sakura doesn't have a whole lot of chakra, put two and two together.</br></br></br>  <br>A day's worth of babysitting is hardly anything. Meanwhile Sasuke is actually going to train Boruto which will take a while.</br>    <br>64 trigrams decimates the chakra flow, cutting off Sakura's regen and power long enough to knock her out. <br>Karin has complete eternal regen from biting herself and drawing on Uzumaki chakra, and sealing/detection abilities to avoid the fists. Sakura's disadvantage is always gonna be her low speed and reliance on pure chakra/dmg output. She's most effective against armies and groups rather than single opponents.<br>idk if she can still resist Ino since she lost the split personality thing.<br>The real game changer would be her summoning Tsunade's slugs imo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>sauce is still missing his arm?</br>  <br><br>When Karin is the mom, I will saddle my winged pig and fly down to hell in order to ice skate.</br></br>  <br>I added this to my collection of SSfags for the day the truth is revealed.</br>  <br> Implying that chakra nature won't be associated mainly with Sasuke. </br>  <br>Something Hinata never used in the series?</br>  <br>The villains had done so much bullshit, I was not even surprised. Meanwhile Sakura kept getting owned every time she tried to 'help'.</br>  <br> Sasuke is his mom </br>  <br>he didn't want another arm.</br>  <br>she still needs to control it and she can't do that if her chakra network is fucked</br>  <br>The only relevant Hyuga was Neji.</br>  <br>It was never stated that, Byakugun works like using pressure points. Its not an actual seal.</br>  <br>Yeah I can see it.<br><br> Boruto pulls the chidori in the chunnin exams the exact same way Sasuke did in his. <br> Everyone in the crowd goes "That sure is Hinata's kid" </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes it was, but we weren't talking about kakashi were we.</br>  <br>yes and ss fags are super pissed about it</br>  <br> Boruto is introduced as Naruto's son <br> meanwhile all the other kids are introduced as two characters' children <br><br>Possibly.</br></br></br></br>  If Sasuke were female, nobody would say Boruto was Hinata's kid.  <br><br>Everybody on /a/ already got out all their rage last week though, or did you miss that?<br><br>Most of the responses you're gonna see this week if Sakura is the mom will be "meh, what a waste" so I think your glorious opportunity to wallow in some sense of victory has already passed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Might as well be</br>  <br>Chidori = Lightning = Sasuke<br><br>That's the main reason why Sauce will teach him shit. Don't be surprised if they never mention Hinata in the equation, even though by logic Boruto inherited his lightning nature from her.</br></br></br>  <br>Well Hinata kinda is a female Sasuke.</br>  <br>More like<br> "Oh another one of these faggots. Where's his onesie?" </br></br>  <br>Apparently Minato had lightning nature too.</br>  <br><br>The people who raged last week were those who were too dumb to understand that Sakura's strength isn't an inheritable trait. Surely there is a lot of overlap, but there are still enough people left who think Karin is the mom. Just look at the reaction ITT when evil's "code" was cracked.</br></br>  <br>if sasuke were female naruto would be a much better series.</br>  <br> Plus Hokage so even less time for him. <br>Didn't Tsunade and Hiruzen and Tobirama all train people while they were hokage? And Nalt is serving during a time of peace, disregarding the sudden appearance of Edward Rinneganhands I honestly can't imagine what the fuck he's been so busy with.</br></br>  <br>kek. No she isn't</br>  <br>Self destruct seems to be the true one.</br>    <br>Yes. <br><br>They cut her body chakra, not the chakra she has sealed APART. <br>She would just keep on regenerating the SAME WAY NARUTO DID.<br><br>Jesus christ stop wanking Hinata. Hinata stands no chance of touching her anyways, go watch Sasori fight again. <br><br> Low speed <br>Watch sasori fight again<br>Karin also can't keep biting herself. <br><br><br>You said it yourself too, Sakura has Katsuyu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Madara or Hashirama should have been female so they could literally be Ninja Romeo and Juliet</br>  06/30/2015, still no sign of Chouchou being in the movie.  <br>They have the basic storyline, minus the edge, and muh vengeance.</br>  <br>only in the way she wants naruto's dick in her.</br>  <br>I guess a susano arm would be viable</br>  <br>Naruto winning the day and giving TNJ sounds likely.<br>So does Shin self destructing.<br>Kabuto raising the rest of the shins sounds good.<br>Orochimaru being himself also sounds likely.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Good. I've had enough of that fat parrot.</br></br>  According to Evil, this guy is showing up this chapter.<br><br>We might see Kabuto and his snake penis.</br></br>  <br> Sauce and Bort enter the arena in the exact same fashion as him and Kakashi did with leaves and everything <br> a recovering Salad pops another tomoe from sheer butthurt </br></br>  <br>It's very possible.</br>  <br>Naruto didn't regenerate, he used the Kyuubi chakra to force his gates back open. There wasn't anything to regenerate anyway</br>  <br> Jesus christ stop wanking Hinata. <br><br>srop wanking sakura<br><br> Watch sasori fight again <br>the one where chiyo did most of the work?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ironically, Hinata actually has Ligthning affinity</br>  <br>No, that's Salad. Even the captcha agrees with me.</br>  <br>Fight is over.<br><br>Hinata almost died to Zetsu and Naruto saved her, she had to go all out against mini-jubi jobbers</br></br></br>  <br>Who's this again?</br>  <br><br> Surely there is a lot of overlap, but there are still enough people left who think Karin is the mom. <br><br>What's your point? The fact that you have gone through all this trouble to supposedly save a bunch of screencaps in hopes of creating a most ebin reply makes you look more invested in this shit than anyone else.<br><br> Just look at the reaction ITT when evil's "code" was cracked. <br><br>Jokes and banter. Anyone who would have been genuinely upset at the prospect of Sarada being Sakura's kid afterall has already let off their steam or come to terms with it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't mind seeing Kabuto again. He was my favorite Nurudu villain.</br>  <br>one of the orphans that was at root's orphanage of horrors with kabuto</br>  <br> srop wanking sakura <br><br>She is the fourth strongest female character. Hinata and Karin don't even come close to her.</br></br></br>  <br> she had to go all out against mini-jubi jobbers <br>No, that was Sakura.</br></br>  <br>More like Sasuke is the female Hinata.</br>  <br>Except Chiyo stopped controlling her body after she realized Sakura was way better than she could ever move her. Check how she dodges the puppets, Hinata can't beat Zetsu.<br>Sakura also saved Chiyo.</br></br>  <br><br>I only liked him as Oro's assistant. The two had an interesting dynamic.</br></br>  <br>That's hilariously correct.<br><br>Chidori isn't Hinata's technique, though.<br><br>That's why is more likely the crowd will be doing Sasuke paralels than any mention of Hinata.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And again doesn't help the fact that she's slow making such an attack useless in a one on one fight. It only really works for a large group of enemies, not a single opponent.</br>  <br>Mods like that are cancer <br>I miss moot at least he understood how threads worked ie deleting the ones that went off topic fast..sonetimes</br></br>  More shit from attention whore<br><br> Oops fell asleep.  <br><br> I should have mixed up the paragraphs so you wouldn't find that so easily. Ah well, hindsight is always 20/20. I guess I should probably clear this up, we do find out who Chocho's real father is in this chapter. </br></br></br></br>  Evil is back  <br> the one where chiyo did most of the work? <br>I don't understand this. Yes, Chiyo did most of the work, against a guy that killed the strongest kage the Sand has ever had.<br><br>Yet it's by far the most and best we get to see from any of the female Konoha kunoichi in a fight against a decent opponent.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Except Chiyo it was proven was controlling her through out the entire battle. It wasn't Sakura who was fighting, get over it.</br>  <br>What are you even posting? <br><br>really just stop, it's embarrassing. Also if you want to discuss powerlevels so much go check comicvine or something. <br><br>Sakura is the strongest and that's a fact, 64 palms can be healed just like Naruto did, Hinata stands no chance against her and like I said Hinata lost to Zetsu. <br><br>Karin WOULD trap her in the chains but she can't keep them all the time and she can't avoid being killed by KATSUYU in the meantime. <br>Temari is a no go either because she focuses on cutting her oponents and cutting Sakura does not effect.<br><br>Bye anon</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 20/20 <br>Eyesight confirmed</br></br>  <br>I dunno. Dragon Sage was pretty cool.</br>  <br><br>I usually don't visit spoiler threads. Can you tell me where he posts?</br></br>  <br> Yet it's by far the most and best we get to see from any of the female Konoha kunoichi in a fight against a decent opponent. <br><br>not like the other had fights<br><br>sakura is strong, but the hyuuga are tailor made to fuck up her main offense</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And what does she say now?</br>  <br><br>So, wait, Karinfags really did win?</br></br>  <br><br>I couldn't enjoy it because Itashit was there.</br></br>  <br>Haven't read the manga have we? Chiyo stops controlling Sakura after a while because Sakura is just better.<br><br>Go read the manga see you</br></br></br>  <br> 64 palms can be healed just like Naruto did <br>It's not even something you heal you retard</br></br>  <br> hindsight is 20/20 <br>Salad's Rinnegan confirmed.</br></br>  <br>Purple color motif<br>Eye powers<br>Father who pays more attention to sibling <br>Inferiority complex with sibling<br>Older brother figure<br>Devastating battle with older brother figure<br>Older brother figure sacrifices himself, entrusts Naruto with caring for them<br>Yin type<br>Watched Naruto from afar with secret admiration throughout childhood</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And now she's gone again.</br>  <br>Salad gets 20/20 vision and Chou Chou's father is someone other than Chouji.</br>    Why don't hinata's kids have Byakugam? Naruto is dumb you guys should stop liking bad things.  <br>It's just something you ignore. Like Naruto did. Get over it and go read the manga again. <br><br>Seriously this is my last post, Hinata lost to Zetsu while Sakura was punching Kaguya. Get over your fanwanking, Hinata is just weaker I don't know why you're obsessing over it. <br><br>Stronger or weaker doesn't mean better or worse, in this case they're both shit in the writing department and none of the two are good characters. One has the advantage of being main girl that's just it.<br><br>I'm out wanker</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shouldn't this apply to every fucking thing?<br><br>One Piece threads every day<br>Fairy Tail threads every day<br>Tokyo Ghoul threads every day<br><br> and so forth</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> muh Izanami accept yourself asspull <br>That was bullshit. Orochibuto had that shit in the bag.<br><br><br>I miss old Shippuden.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sasuke confirmed for Chouchou's real dad </br>  <br> C-Chiyo's not controlling Sakura <br>you can still literally see the wires on her.</br></br>  <br>Don't reply to shitposters</br>  <br>You've been talking to multiple people you idiot, I only was correcting you on the palms chakra sealing shit, Sakura would probably win anyway</br>  <br>That's a speedline</br>  <br> Why don't hinata's kids have Byakugam? <br>Kishi don't give a shit about it.</br></br>  <br>it's just bantz m8</br>  <br><br><br> Kishi rused us with Sarada learning about her paternity when the story was really about Chouchou the WHOLE time. <br><br>I can live with this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because you want to watch the world burn as do I</br>  <br> we do find out who Chocho's real father is in this chapter <br> almost dies trying to rescue your edgy ass <br> reward him by cucking the shit out of him and having him raise the kid </br></br></br>  <br>It would be Kishi pulling an actual Kubo.</br>  <br>No, it isn't. Look behind the sound effect. It twists. It's a string.</br>  <br>She stops after that, I'm sure that's the reason anon posted it.
