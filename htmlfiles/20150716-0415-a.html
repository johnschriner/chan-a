[ The anime made Centorea so much cuter than I thought she was in the manga. Mero is looking like a real cutie pie in anime form too.  HS or raw?  <br>How about you try reading before asking?</br>   cutie pie   <br>Huh?</br>  Cerea straight-up killed that truck driver.  So I take it this shit is censored on TV right? Is ATX showing lewds or do we have to wait for the BDs?  Papi papa harpy papi?  <br>There's no uncensored tv version.<br>Buy the BD's</br></br>  <br>Filename<br>We also already have a thread up.</br></br>  Monster girls are spooky.  If there's another thread, I can't find it.  I haven't seen anyone taking into consideration the fact that rachnera will have to shed her spider carapace at some point.<br>What would you do with a giant empty spider carapace?</br>  I don't know why but listening to Miia go "darling" over and over got old really fast.   Bestiality is now socially acceptable <br>T-thanks Japan.</br>  <br>Made me laugh.</br>   Reminder Ms. Smith is Best Girl.   <br>not for me, I love it when she does it</br>  <br>Make a shield.<br><br><br>It's the same in the manga, plus her seiyuu kinda sucks.<br><br>So much better having Papi going papinohapinopapi</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who are you quoting?</br>  <br>I made the same post about 2 years ago without the green text and been reposting ever since</br>  <br>Rachnee's pretty much fully grown, though. Why would she need to shed?</br>  I'm ripping some gifs out of last episode<br>any requests?</br>  <br>Delusional head pat from the opening. That was too cute.</br>  <br><br>When they go into the hot springs and accidentally pull down Darling's towel, then Suu says, Size:Small</br></br>  <br><br>...I read that wrong.</br></br>  <br>Can you make of of scary Miia in the tree?</br>  <br><br> Mero is looking like a real cutie pie in anime form too. <br><br>I don't like how pronounced her gills are.<br><br>They were creepy/unappealing enough in the manga, but in the intro she legitimately looks like she's had her rib-cage vivisected.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  would this quality be sufficient for the gentlemen?<br><br>sucking loop at ~6 fps</br></br>  <br><br>I think the same thing. Im totally cool with mermaids and whatnot, but those things are pretty gross. I wish they went he MGQ way of mermaids.</br></br>  <br><br> I haven't seen anyone taking into consideration the fact that rachnera will have to shed her spider carapace at some point. <br><br>That's a big assumption.<br>Arachnaes may not need to shed like spiders do.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> What would you do with a giant empty spider carapace? <br><br>Make a badass ornament for my truck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you could up it to 7fps, it would be much smoother. Dont go higher than that, though as it would look uncanny.</br>  <br><br>That's only with Centaurs. Pretty much every other Monmusu Species is just beautiful women with some exotic fantasy-features added.<br>Cenraurs are the only full-blown animal-pussy owners.</br></br></br>  <br><br>But they get drunk off caffeine, so it would make sense if they did that like real spiders.</br></br>  <br> Reminder Ms. Smith is best Girl. <br>That pic is old get the new.</br></br>  <br>I am not too sure why there is so much love for that lazy chick.</br>  <br>http://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/i<wbr>m_the_main_character_of_a_harem_man<wbr>ga_but_im_gay_so_every_day_is_hell_<wbr>for_me#1<br>Just leave this here...</br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  http://www.redbubble.com/shop/monst<wbr>er+musume+t-shirts<br><br>Which one should I get, /a/?<br>Barring of course the shitty ones that are just official concept-art slapped on a t-shirt.</br></br></br></wbr>  <br> dat red one <br><br>Dear God, my eyes.<br><br>That said, the sports club one looks nice if you're into fitness.</br></br></br></br></br>  Miia's variety of Lamia is STILL the best type of Lamia in existence.  <br>I want to run my fingers over Mero's silky smoth gils!!!</br>   Smith a best <br> horse pussy <br> Suu is best <br> Rachnera is best <br> using real life physics for monster girl genitalia <br> Secondaries <br> "read the manga" <br> Truck driver is dead <br> one guys opinions will turn into a multi-thread shitpost war <br>am I missing anything?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Medusa is the best. How can you be so casual?</br>  <br><br>With Fantasy-Creatures you get to pick and choose what traits are mirrored from an animal they resemble.<br><br>Getting shit-faced on caffeine is cute.

And it is shown in the manga that they go all in for the animalistic characters.<br><br>Case in point:<br>Centera gets spooked like a real horse<br>Rach gets drunk off caffeine<br>Miia is cold blooded &amp; sheds skin.<br><br><br>As you can see, they go 100 percent.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>loop version</br>  <br><br> Having a Lamia with wings, making the wings totally useless </br></br>  <br>full version with some quality drop</br>  <br><br>You forgot the one faggot that doesn't like Monster Musume or romance/comedy/fantasy in general, yet comes into the thread and goes "lel this is so lame why do you watch this garbage? xD".</br></br>  <br><br>Well fuck dude, they say the half dragon girls who have wings are useless too.<br><br>They fucking hate flight.<br><br><br><br>Are you sure that is it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well I deleated the bit out where he pops up<br>want that on it too?</br></br>  <br><br>No.. I mean, you linked to my comment about Miia being in the tree. Not the other guy who wanted the head pat.</br></br>  <br><br>But those are still examples of picking and choosing qualities to mirror.<br><br>Counter-examples are things like Miia not having some disgusting shit-hole near the end of her tail, Papi not shitting from balconies, Mero not fucking dying after 3 minutes out of the water, Cathy being based on a bull despite bulls being by definition exclusively male, etc.<br><br>Monmusu are Fantasy-Creatures, not some sort of strict application of any and all animal-properties to women.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>appearantly I'm stupid</br>  <br><br>You have yet to show a proper counter example.<br><br>There are fish that can be out of water for a while. Papi is not shown where she poops. The question about Miia and her pooping as well as not understood. Cathy is a minotaur, not a bull. Totally different.<br><br>Set. Game. Match</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you I will use it in the next thread</br>  <br><br>Gills aren't silky or smooth.<br><br>They're nasty slit-shaped gashes in her chest. They look painful, AND are painful to look at.<br><br>I really don't like a lot of the biological-design decisions Okayado makes with his Mermaids, which I believe he did to make them seem physically further from human, which I feel was necessary. (I think his designs for characters like Luz do the same thing: In trying to avoid using the tried and true Kenomimi design for a Kitsune, he tried to be more original, and in doing so just turned her into a Furry, which I feel is worse than just being slightly unoriginal.)<br><br>America's had the design for Mermaids down since Disney did it right in 1989.<br>Just write it so their lungs can aspirate water. It's that simple to write gills out of the equation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Anime news network review of episode 1 and 2 <br><br> Weird shading on boobs is distracting, Smith is annoying. Some questions that really need answering aren't. Number of monster girls is getting to be a bit much. <br><br>....wow</br></br></br></br>   Snake girl confesses her love to MC while literally grabbing his fucking dick <br>How is this a harem? How can the other girls compete when Snake already has such a huge head start?</br>  <br> number of monstergirls getting too much <br> at ep 2 </br></br>  <br> Japanese truck driver <br>Who cares about scum like that<br>Who knows how many lolis he has killed with his truck</br></br></br>  <br><br> Papi is not shown where she poops. <br><br>So you believe there is a legitimate possibility that in the future Okayado will reveal that Papi shits all over car-windows.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Luz and Polt are qt though</br>  <br><br>Snake?!</br></br>  <br>Smith covered it up so she can continue her evil deeds</br>  <br>ANN reviews are written by homofags that don't even like anime</br>  <br>I don't understand why she has gills in the first place. Her tailfins are already horizontal rather than vertical, as they are in aquatic mammals like seals and dolphins, creatures that generally hold their breath when under water. Couldn't they just go with that route rather than giving her gills in addition to having a nose, an organ that only serves the purpose of smelling and breathing?</br>  <br><br> Cathy is a minotaur, not a bull. Totally different. <br><br>Minotaurs are by definition "A bull with the body of a man". Bulls are exclusively male.<br>Hell, she even has bull-like horns.<br><br>The female equivalent of a Minotaur is a Holstaurus, which is what Cathyl WOULD have been if Okayado weren't taking justified creative liberties.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Papi is not best Harpy</br>  <br>Picked the fuck up.</br>  So do harpies puke in their offspring's mouths?  <br><br>  which I feel was necessary. <br>*unnecessary<br><br>Fucking auto-correct.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>legit homofags or homofags?</br>  <br><br>Awesome. <br><br>Are you trying to kill people?<br><br>Thanks.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Papi wa Haapi da Papi da yo</br>  <br>Why are you making up bullshit?<br>The review says none of that shit.</br></br>  <br><br>That's hardly Miia's only advantage.<br><br>The real question is that if this is a "harem", how can the other girls compete with the unequivocal Best Girl, especially when she's the first one introduced?</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's making up bullshit<br>Here's the review, so you don't get tricked by lies<br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/rev<wbr>iew/monster-musume/episodes-1-2/.90<wbr>455</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>    <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/rev<wbr>iew/monster-musume/gn-1</wbr></br>  <br>this time<br><br><br> Are you trying to kill people? <br>well, I am a huge faggot</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Great, now I'm imagining Papi scat singing.</br>  <br>...This is fucking awesome.</br>  <br>That's a manga review<br>That asshole claimed it was the anime review of Episodes 1 and 2. <br>And the anime review said nothing the faggot claimed it did.<br>They're also done by different people<br>If you're gonna complain about ANN, get your fact right first</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Mero having to hold her breath underwater <br><br>I don't know. It seems kind of pointless to have an aquatic creature like a Mermaid that can STILL drown.<br>I think it'd be easier to just have your fictional Mermaids be able to aspirate and respirate water the same way humans can do with air.<br><br>Trying to fuck with Mermaid biology over that just seems like a case of "Well, time to re-invent the wheel in order to not seem unoriginal".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Monmusu based on a chicken <br> "Poultry" <br> Not a Cockatrice <br><br>You fucked up, Okayado. You fucked up.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Well fuck dude, they say the half dragon girls who have wings are useless too. <br> They fucking hate flight. <br>Crabman is just making sure that Harpies stay special as one of the few races capable of true flight. Basically a lot of races have non-functional wings but Harpies get mostly exclusive access to the skies unless more powerful magical races get introduced.</br></br></br>  <br>Why did the little girl have the traditional Lamia hair clips?</br>  <br>Why are you defending ANN?</br>  <br>Truth. Let's analyze the competition in order of introduction:<br><br> Papi <br>Literally retarded<br><br> Centorea <br>Horse pussy<br><br> Suu <br>Semi-sentient, barely intelligent<br><br> Mero <br>Murderfish<br><br> Rachnee <br>Probably Miia's only worthy competitor, but introduced way too late to be relevant. Maybe if she was the second or third girl things would get exciting.<br><br> Lala <br>Who?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw no poultry gf to help you meet your macros </br>  <br>Poultry is a catagory of subspecies while a cockatrice would be a species within that catagory.</br>   getting so buttblasted over what a fucking ANN faggot thinks   <br> Monster Musume is a shamelessly trashy series that revels in finding convenient excuses to display its female cast in various states of undress. It's reprehensible from nose to tail, and decent folk should avoid it like the plague. I say these things with a heavy heart, because I have to admit that I thoroughly enjoyed this first pair of episodes. Against all odds, this show is a horrifying amount of fun. <br>Well, at least someone's having a great time.</br></br>  <br>I really want to see emu harpy</br>  <br> that Miia <br>Such a great taste in sleepwear.</br></br>  <br><br> suu <br> Semi-sentient, barely intelligent <br><br>This bait is so fucking stupid.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I think it'd be easier to just have your fictional Mermaids be able to aspirate and respirate water the same way humans can do with air. <br>But how would they get involved with humans on the long term then, if they're closer to fish than to aquatic mammals? Monmusume solves it by saying Merio can breathe air as long as her gills are wet, but that sounds fishy to me.</br></br>  NEW VIDEO<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/14369<wbr>46019<br>NEW VIDEO<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/14369<wbr>46019<br>NEW VIDEO<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/14369<wbr>46019<br><br>Someone is saving all of these right?</br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>my little pony (adult version)</br>  <br>This one better be of Papi</br>  <br> Such a great taste in sleepwear. <br>That wear is not for sleeping.

Isn't that Cecilia?</br>  <br>Who?</br>    <br>The stupid one who has to poison or blow-up her competitors in order to have a chance.</br>  <br>Dat midriff. I wanna lick it.</br>  Can we discuss about the tech of IS? Like, what makes IS a growth item?      I couldn't care less about IS but I'm very interested in watching this OVA.    <br><br>Why is that?</br></br>  <br>Who knows</br>  <br>BRITISH ARSE</br>  <br><br>Unf.</br></br>  <br><br>Wow you mean there's actual nudity in this shit? I always assumed it was one of those annoying ecchi tease shows.</br></br>  Smooth and slick.  <br><br>Just in BD, TV Broadcast version always covered nips with light/thick fog. Sometime they even cut out the nude scenes entirely.</br></br>    <br>I remember fapping hard to pictures with visible ribs for weeks after this.</br>  <br>Mountain Dew bath?</br>  <br>I have a feeling my balls would hurt really badly if I went into a hot mountain dew bath.</br>  <br><br>Green tea. In Japan there're some of those fancy herbal bath for some reason.</br></br>  <br>Similar to rose petals bath or milk bath me guess.</br>          <br>Houki is still the worst and Charlotte is still the best 4 and a half years later.</br>  <br>WHITE POWER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</br>      <br>No. Houki is the best while Charlotte is average. The worst is  you. </br>  I really wish we had more OVA's or something.<br><br>I really need my fill of harem shit.<br><br> I also want to post more Rin </br></br></br></br>      Possibly one of the worst shows I've watched in my entire life.  <br>Eh? Nandatte?</br>  <br><br>Those abs.</br></br>  <br>Let's start with this then.<br><br> - Laura is not actually a human after all?<br>- In fact she's a perfect creation. The living IS gear? Dear god.</br> </br></br></br>  <br>The hell? Where the fuck is this in the ln?</br>  <br><br>I don't know. I'm still waiting for the novelfag to clarify.</br></br>  I hope Izuru goes with the Highschool dxd route and has all the girls get impregnated by Ichika  <br>Yeah? I hope he goes with the Hagani route.</br>  <br> Houki's unrealistic idolized bersion of Ichika <br>I wonder why she thinks she still has a chance with the guy after all that physical abuse. Maybe her plan is to knock every brain cell out of his head so he'd be too dumb to say no?</br></br>  <br>Considering how fucked up men in ISverse, she would want a complete docile Ichika (and stronk due to tanking her attacks every time).</br>  <br><br>I'm not the one you were talking to, but I have volume 8 handy. Let's see:<br><br> Chloe opened her tightly closed eyes. <br> Her eyes were of strange colors; her left eye was black, and her right eye was golden. <br> "An IS developed together with a biological body? Has that Tabane developed it to this extent?" <br><br>and<br><br> "That's…not my little sister…she's an incomplete me…the completed form <br>of Laura Bodewig."<br><br>So the novel translation suggests that Laura is an incomplete Chloe and the anime translation suggests that Chloe is an incomplete Laura. I'm sure it's a quirk of the language that resulted in the two versions, but I'm not sure which is true. I do know that Laura's nanomachine implantation failed and that Chloe can generate illusions, so I'm inclined to go with the first option.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know if you've noticed this, but Houki isn't exactly right in the head. None of them are, of course, but she seems particularly damaged. As far as she's concerned, she did nothing wrong and was in the right to punish him for whatever slight, real or imaginary. And she thinks she has a chance with him because her entire world has revolved around him for years, there's just no room in her mind for a version of things where he isn't with her.<br><br>I'd have thought IS academy would have a child therapist, given all the emotionally unstable teens handling superweapons and being foisted with responsibility, but then I remembered that it was Japan and that therapy is for shameful people there.</br></br></br>  <br>They treat superweapon like sport, SPORT, you get it? It's like they will allow us to spam nuke like a fucking casual sport.</br>  <br> As far as she's concerned, she did nothing wrong and was in the right to punish him for whatever slight, real or imaginary. <br>Considering it is slapstick comedy, Houki is absolutely correct. The only people who are not exactly right in the head are people who do not understand this.<br>Not that any alleged violence against Ichika means anything anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>No, it can't be a slapstick comedy. Those are actually funny.</br>  <br>Wut?Is this a homage to Keitaro's immortal skill?</br>  <br>Germany and France are best and the only decent girls that matters.</br>  <br> Highschool dxd route <br>You mean not being permitted to breed by the editors? Try the Eroge VN protag route. You've got guys like Itou Makoto &amp; Haruka Kasugano impregnating virtually everyone. <br><br>This actually makes sense. After the creation of the IS, the society is noted to become female-dominant. The robbers in that maid cafe with Char and Laura were noted to be especially crazy for robbing such a women filled place. The IS world is something like the radical feminist's wet dream only men still exist.</br></br></br></br>  <br> impregnating virtually everyone <br>Even older sister?</br></br>  <br>Dickoto even fucked a trap and multiple milf so there you go.</br>  <br>Especially older sister.</br>  <br>Laura.</br>  <br>See  https://drive.google.com/folderview<wbr>?id=0B65rxTyUv5HxZm9wUGxoUy1zOVU&amp;us<wbr>p=sharing#list</wbr></wbr> </br>  <br>I'd rather have a nice boat.</br>  <br>Especially oneesan.</br>  <br>Double Yandere love &gt; Boats</br>  Chapter 15 when?  <br><br> mfw no cute maid to catch. <br>Feels bad man.</br></br></br>  <br>Yesu.<br><br> Chaika edit for Laura <br>Saved.</br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw no Kotonoha X Yuuki <br>Why even bother.</br></br>  <br> Kotonoha X Yuuki <br>Absolutely disgusting anon.

Like a nearby upperclassman?” <br><br> “Thaaaat is a completely different issue!!

Based on how the school was still shaking from further blasts, that was no joke. He did not want to bother her, so he gathered the strength of his heart to restrain himself. <br><br> However, Kumokawa Seria had secretly tensed her shoulders and elbows in preparation, so she pouted her lips when nothing happened. <br><br> “(Hm. Sometimes being a gentleman can come full circle and be cruel.)”  <br> “The orientation isn’t limited to our school, right? If you’re really worried for your life, it would probably be best to evacuate the school grounds until the heat dies down.” <br><br> “Y-you’re right. Okay! Thanks a bunch, senpai! I’ll be going now!!” <br><br> “Eh? No, wait. I was suggesting I could wander around with you!!” <br> “Huh? Senpai? Why are you here?” <br><br> He turned around by the shoe lockers and Kumokawa Seria cleared her throat. <br><br> “You can head outside if you want, but there will be ‘police officers’ out on the streets, too. Do you know how you’ll escape and what you’ll use for transportation?” <br><br> “Yeah, no worries there. There’s that new bicycle…um, the acrobike? Y’know, that electrically assisted monster. Komoe-sensei got a little carried away and ordered one for us, so I can borrow that.” <br><br> “(Now, I’m getting pissed off. He never thinks anything through, so why is he so prepared now of all times!?)”  <br><br>Seria a cute and Touma a dense motherfucker. It's kind of funny and adorable how she wants Touma to just jump on her and how she wants to get closer to him and tries to give him a fucking hint to go for her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Seria's pissed off face <br>Why boner</br></br>  Man, Touma's a lucky fucker to get that letter.

They can still develop her relationship with Touma as show in NT12. Besides when she goes back to being human she attains the body she had before becoming a magic god.

He told them to fuck off and they followed him to Denmark to beat his ass.</br></br>  <br>If you thing that's something "new" I have bad news for you newfriend</br>  <br> this niggah </br>  <br>Touma could easily work for necessarious or the golden dawn and be stupid rich<br>Heck, he could have been the second in comand in gremlin if he wanted to</br></br>  <br>Being a magic terrorist and having a job are two different things.</br>  <br>Nah fam i don't remember him saying shit.</br>  <br> Protects Othinus from artillery <br> Hugs Othinus in front of everyone <br> Goes to Denmark alone with her <br>You don't have literally say fuck off to say fuck off, so fuck off, Anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's just dumb as fuck doing these jobs for free.</br>  <br>Mikotofags being BTFO would entail the cancellation of her manga, being replaced by a different electrical mascot for Dengeki's brand and being killed offpanel with Touma brushing it off as "shit happens". None of which is likely to happen.</br>  <br>Not all jobs have to be honest and a Touma rulen gremlin would be very different</br>  <br>Now that's just silly.</br>  <br>Yes you do in Touma's case so fuck off as well.</br>   killing the T because someone sent him a love letter  <br>This bitches are crazy<br>And they ain't even a yandere character</br></br>  <br>They just wanted Touma to ask them out but don't realize getting a love letter is an entirely different thing altogether.<br><br>Granted they also quickly realized Touma's a goddamn idiot and it isn't a love letter. Wonder if they followed him to see the magic god, at least?</br></br></br>  So is Touma dead yet?  <br><br>Yeah he died few Vol ago and is only going forward as a husk due to Othinus being kind.</br></br>  <br> Taking gag scenes seriously <br>Why?</br></br>  <br>His dead inside m8</br>   mfw touma doesn't even punch the shit out of bitches no more <br><br>Why haven't you guys dropped this shit already?</br></br>  Touma is quite easy.  <br><br>NT 10 made me wonder how long until he loses his mind and goes AWOL.</br></br>  <br>Gag scene or no, Touma's been through some shit and could probably use someone who's genuinely not violent. He even likes stereotypical ara-ara onee-sans, and those are typically not violent.<br>You forget how he nearly casually mindbroke Aogamu and Tsuchimikado by calling them not otakus? That was pure evil. He's got some stress built up and is just hiding it.</br></br>  <br> tfw we'll never see his best punch against carissa animated </br>  <br>No I'm waiting for him to actually break and turn demon<br><br><br>Like ollerus hinted<br><br><br>We just need for that slut called othinus to die in front of him</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not necessarily Othinus, it can be any girl he cares about.</br>    <br>All of my sides. Kamachi is the best troll.</br>  <br>It doesn't even have to be something big to take him over the edge.<br>Just at the thought of St. Germaine possibly being a magic god who was after him was causing him to lose it.<br><br>He barely has it together; a tiny push will be just as effective as a big one in this case.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop it! Don't give him any ideas!</br>   At the same time, he clenched his fist hard enough that he thought it would break and he opened his eyes in such a ghastly expression it seemed tears of blood were going to start flowing from them <br><br><br>Poor lad</br></br></br>   Niggas actually think touma will ever go full demon mode <br><br>Stop deluding yourself fags.</br></br>  <br>He seems to be somewhat ok with High Priest, although he is being a bit more cautious than usual</br>  <br> “I had a feeling it was something like this. I didn’t get my hopes at all. Not in the slightest!! You’re probably some magician after Index, so hurry up and attack so I can destroy your illusion alreadyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy<wbr>yyyyy!!”</wbr> <br><br>I feel bad for laughing</br></br></br>  <br>Well, consider the circumstances. Touma was trying to figure out if it really was a magic god this time, and then when Touma starts to think he's serious, High Priest completely turns the mood on its head with a joke.</br>  <br>Pretty much, which means that he isn't pulling a Kodaka at least.<br><br>The girls should  JUST DO IT </br></br></br>  <br>Satan confirms</br>  <br>Magic God Satan?</br>  <br>His becoming aware of how things usually happens</br>  <br>Ye he ded.</br>   “It’s true the world might look fragile to some people. To a Magic God up in the clouds, it’s something you can remake as many times as you like. …But that’s still wrong. This isn’t an RPG that was made to be beaten and it doesn’t just reach ‘the end’ once it is beaten. I’m in the center? I’m the pillar supporting it? If so, the world’s lifespan is only about one hundred years. That just can’t be. It’ll continue on even when I die.” <br><br> “How naïve. Or were you too thoroughly imprinted with the idea that all people are equal?” <br><br>Touma confirmed to continue suffering for eternity</br></br></br></br>   In an instant, bits and pieces of frightening memories stabbed into the back of Kamijou Touma’s mind. <br><br> He had already grown a bit tearful. </br></br>  <br> Touma  <br> Ever actually dying </br></br>    <br>As much as the gag scenes try to hide it, the billions of hells did seriously leave its mark on Touma.</br>  <br>Othinus is most beta of them all. Creating million personal hells is fucking roundabout way to get people understand you.</br>  <br>That was likely actually a case of Othinus herself not knowing she wanted someone to understand her.</br>  <br>What a little bitch.</br>  <br> butthurt Accelfag is at it again </br>      <br> Creating million personal hells is fucking roundabout way to get people understand you. <br>But she went through all these hells while trying to go back to her original world.<br>So only someone with a similar experience could understand her.</br></br></br>  <br>H3 dead</br>  So accelerator is definitely not in this volume?  <br><br>We confirmed that a few days ago.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, no Shitcelerator in this volume.</br>   Seria is also an angry tsundere that reacts in exaggerated I'll kill Touma fashion <br>Seria a shit? Seria a shit.</br>  <br>What emotion dose this face try to convey?</br>  <br>He's as relevant as Himegami. Go get your fix with the Accel manga/</br>  This High Priest guy is too hilarious. <br>I don't expect him to be like this.</br>  <br>  It’ll continue on even when I die. <br><br>no escape now</br></br></br>  <br>Haven't been on these threads for a while but fuk guess I'll pick up this shit another time then, thanks.</br>  <br>Thinking it and actually doing it is different.<br>She never did anything to him so far.</br></br>  <br>To be fair, he's touching the tits of a legit mummy and a purple Chinese vampire. How the fuck is he supposed to feel?</br>  So... Why girls just can't confess to him first?  <br><br>See you in a few years.</br></br>  <br>Status quo.</br>  <br>Come round the corner and say that again faggot.</br>  <br>Because spaghetti. He also would think that is Thor fucking with him</br>  <br><br>The fact brown skin actually lives at his home now full size must really freak him out deep down.</br></br>  <br> Dem antics <br>I see Mikoto is still best girl.</br></br>  Next Volume should be Accelerator vs Not-Touma  <br>PTSD<br>and now one of them live in his place.<br>His suffering is eternal.</br></br></br>  <br>Because that isn't allowed. Keep up, dude.</br>  <br><br>Best burden girl.</br></br>  <br>I'm always down for Accel getting his shit kicked in</br>  <br>Nuit or bro end soon.</br>  <br><br>I think he just gave up and retreated inside at how it's all worthless to do anything. No will to try anything. Just let it be.</br></br>    <br>because yandere IB-chan keeps all other girls away, too bad that his right hand is a fate changing yandere that want him to masturbate for the rest of his life.</br>  <br>As far as we know, he invites her to his home to presumably talk. I don't think it said she was actually going to live there, and even if she does, she'll likely move out once AntiTouma goes back to his own Delta Squad.</br>  <br>Can't wait for the doujins, especially if she's going to last.</br>      <br><br>Minor nitpick, but her eyes are supposed to constantly switch colors so would be nice to see someone give them different colors sometime.</br></br>      <br> but her eyes are supposed to constantly switch colors <br>I thought it said she could and does change them at a whim, not constantly changing. For all we know, her "whim" could last over 1,000 years.</br></br>  <br>But awaki is best girl.</br>  <br> Implying accel isn't gonna win this time </br>  <br>He's to good for this shitfest.</br>  I do like Chocolate Goddess' design, though.   All these chicks getting wet for Touma when Tsuchimikado is around  <br><br>How?</br></br>  <br> My feet hurts </br>  <br>Do any of these girls look like maids and little sisters? At most he'll get Maria too.</br>    <br><br><br>Damn my fetish</br></br></br>  <br>I prefer Nyang-Nyang</br>  <br>DED</br>  <br>She is kill mate</br>   Touma can't keep a conversation for 15 seconds with Mikoto before she explodes and attacks him <br> He has a very polite and reasonable discussion with a magic god out to get him. <br><br>Fucking teenagers, at this point I think Touma barely passes as one.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Vampires are kill from the start.</br></br>    <br>That's what billion of years inside of hell does that to you</br>  <br>Best Magic God. BEST MAGIC GOD.</br>  <br>I'm just surprised none of these bitches trying to get his dick instead.</br>  <br><br>Literally worst magic god, no wonder kamachi killed this shit off.</br></br>  <br>Oh please. It happened before he had a billion years of Othinus' scent, too.</br>  <br>He killed her because she is best for most impact.</br>  <br>Because they all know he's a siscon.</br>  <br><br>That scent to him is death. After everything is gone, that's the last thing he smelt.</br></br>     headband girl <br><br>So magic gods are literal memelords?</br></br>  <br>But othinus is the worst. <br><br> muh i need someone to understand me </br></br></br>  <br>Aleister is memelord</br>   No one is hyped that fiamma is back   <br>Yeah, well, you're just a faggot.</br>  <br>He stole Styl's role. Jobbing was the one thing Styl had that made him stand out, now it's gone.</br>  <br>I hyped as fuck.</br>  <br><br>He failed his fairy spell, so fuck that.</br></br>  <br> No longer badass <br> Had ONE fucking job and he couldn't do it <br><br>I used to care. Used to.</br></br></br></br>    <br>He should be dead but kamachi just gonna make him shit just like every other character.</br>  <br>  jobbing <br>  made him stand out <br>Because he is only one jobber here? Like literally all dark side level 5 are jobbers and most of magic side who are on top too. Kakine? Check. Mugino? Check. Othinus? Check. Thor? Check.</br></br></br>  <br>Touma needs to give her  his briefs. </br>  <br>Why is this Chinese zombie loli so sexy?</br>  <br>At least Fiamma is still based and being Touma friend and all. Most other guys tried to kill him in Denmark. So fuck them.</br>  <br><br>To make you suffer more.</br></br>  <br>Vampire. Zombie was kill by Dog.</br>   Just checked the Japanese wiki and it seems that the name of the new character that appears at the end with WR is not Takeru but Kamisato Kakeru. 上里翔流(かみさとかける)   <br>Because you're a necrophile.</br>  <br>He is the cutest jobber</br>  <br>Is there some deep meaning in it?<br>Who the fuck is Kamisato?</br></br>  <br>I remember how other fire magician burned his fire sword in Styil SS.</br>  <br>She's not and your taste is awful.</br>  <br>So he is called something along the lines of God Fragment?</br>  <br>She's a Shijie-Xian. Chinese vampires are Jiangshi.</br>  <br>Sexiest girl in Raildex is Carissa anyway.</br>  <br>Necropedophile to be precise</br>  <br><br>Isn't all Magic Gods are technically dead?</br></br>  <br> implying </br>  <br> She's not <br>Gay.<br><br><br><br> Not Lessar <br>Implying implications.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anybody got a link to the epubs taken down?  <br>High Priest starved himself to death, it seems.<br>Nyang-Nyang seems to be a stereotypical Chinese undead thingamajigger.<br>Nephthys is a literal Egyptian mummy (without the dried beef jerky skin) with apparently numerous if not all of her organs outside of her body.<br>Othinus gouged out her eye and hung herself.<br><br>Becoming a magic god sounds like a blast.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  not   casual vento </br>  <br>https://yadi.sk/d/v3qBTocKh3cgX</br>  <br> Implying </br>  <br><br>Just noticed I forgot to put side story epubs up, on it now.</br></br>  Vento probably worst antagonist ever.  <br> Gensokyo is a magic god clubhouse <br><br>Everything makes sense now.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Hope that /jp/ made sure the rope quality of that noose was strong before doing everyone a favor.</br></br>  Well, japs on twitter fucking love high priest, laugh or depressed by fiamma being literally useless and get hyped or irritated at Kamisato.<br>Mikotofags are simply impressed or wonder how they react.<br>also some say thelema was indirectly described as power of will of Aleister that Noukan used to kill high priest.</br></br>  <br>Some girls are just cute, others are just sexy, but then there are those few who are both cute and sexy like Birdway. Strongest gap moe and has the power and attitude of a super sadist boss to make her attractively sexiest.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>He wasn't joking isn't he?</br>  <br> mikoto <br> sexy <br>on her best day she might be cute, but never sexy.</br></br></br>  <br>Is there an HQ version of this?  ;__; </br>  <br>Clean highres illustrations for NT13 can't come soon enough. The spread illustrations of Misaka is super cute.</br>  <br><br>Man if only Jotaro killed the fabulous priest instead of saving his daughter. He could have stopped the god damn world reset.</br></br>  <br> get hyped or irritated at Kamisato <br>Well I'm pretty irritated too.<br>The whole New Testament has been magic gods hype and after a dozen of volume, here is a guy who can destroy them with a single touch.</br></br></br>  <br> on her best day she might be cute <br> on her best day <br>0/8</br></br></br>  <br>How Mikoto can't be sexy when her clones can?</br>  <br><br>Good chunk are annoyed honestly.</br></br>  <br> on her best day she might be cute, but never sexy <br><br>This bitch is just cute but no way she's sexy.</br></br></br>  <br>The Magic Gods are jobbers. Othinus easily was the most intimating of them.<br>The others sat in their secret clubhouse drinking tea as Aleister kicked the door in and flushed them out.<br>Then they went to Academy City where Aleister killed off one of their pals and weakened them while they were laughing about how he couldn't do exactly that.<br><br>Othinus actually did things at least.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Raildex was always like this. Be hype about some guy but in the end he barely can defend himself.</br>  <br><br>Don't think Aleister killed one of them off.</br></br>  <br>  here is a guy who can destroy them with a single touch <br>There is a dog who can kill them with the power of will. Noukan seems to be even more bullshit to me.</br></br>  <br>Mikoto is of the moe category character. Cute is her default state. She can be extremely cute at her peak to be considered one of the cutest. Sexiness might not be her general thing, but she can be very sexy when she sports the right outfit and attitude (mainly of the tomyboy line). Tomboy outfits with hat or her hair down is sex.</br>  <br>I forget. Was the zombie killed by Doghara a magic god or not? Either way, it was Zombie's spell that apparently let them infinitely divide themselves.</br>   It was probably his fault that the amount of alcohol Komoe-sensei consumed had secretly gone up. <br>Poor Komoe-sensei has to deal with Touma's antics.</br>  <br><br>The dog killed him when he was about to smash AC with an asteroid to get rid of the chains on IB.</br></br>  <br>She was sexiest when actually doing stuff. Like it was when she was terrorist or tortured russian girl with oranges.</br>  <br>Komoe doesn't know shit. Imagine how Crowley trying to clean up after him all the times.</br>  <br> tomboy <br>That is what I should have said, so the mikotofags didn't take it negatively. She is a tomboy more often than not, she is really only cutesy when she is embarrassed or fawning on gekota.</br></br>  <br>Perhaps, but she was quite sexy when she fought against Brunhild and Freyja's dragon.</br>  <br><br> Fiamma jobbed <br><br>God dammit</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He was a magic god, but Aleister put a spell on them to fuck with their powers. As when they came into the world there had to depower themselves to be on earth from their own phase which made them weaker from the get go.</br></br>  <br>...Zombie and High Priest are different. Zombie was killed off screen by Dog, yes?<br>And in NT10's epilogue, there's apparently still a chimera girl somewhere.</br></br>  <br>According to High Priest, Aleister had to kill Zombie in order TO fuck with them, right? Or was Zombie just weakened too?</br>  <br>Had to defeat her, the entire point of the spell was to make them killable, if he could kill them without the spell it would defeat the entire purpose.</br>  <br>Fiamma is new Styil like Birdway is new Index.</br>  <br><br>High was killed by anti-Touma while priest was killed by dog. Both are in the LN as it happens.</br></br>  What is Aleister endgame and why he killed Magic Gods?  <br><br>Fuck I screwed that up. Meant to write 'Zombie' instead of 'High'.</br></br>  <br><br>Can Kanzaki be considered both cute and sexy?</br></br>  <br> yfw he is floating in whisky </br>  <br> What is Aleister endgame <br>We don't know.<br> why he killed Magic Gods? <br>They are one of the few things he considered major threats.</br></br></br></br>  <br> why he killed Magic Gods <br><br>He didn't and he thought the High priest did it while not knowing opposite Touma was actually wiping everyone out.</br></br></br>  <br><br>...I'll take it as long as Birday takes Index's remaining screentime.</br></br>  <br>Obviously</br>  We all know who is sexiest girl. <br>But who is sexiest guy?</br>  <br>“Old man, did you start forgetting things once you became a mummy? The zombie girl, the chimera, and everyone are here. It’s just in destiny’s hands whether we run across each other in this place where the tiniest gap extends to an infinite distance” <br> the chimera <br><br>Huh.</br></br></br></br>  <br> World-ending powerhouse killed without ever getting a name or illustration <br>Is this fukou da? Or just  casual vento ?</br></br>  <br>S-She doesn't have green eyes! It can't be her!</br>  <br>There was a perfect chance to do her in that one world where everyone are casual</br>  <br>Why not let the number of girls after them decide it? Touma.</br>  <br><br>Actually Touma is pretty sexy. Would let him punch my dick.</br></br>  <br>Knight leader</br>  <br><br>Wait, both Zombie and Nyang-Nyang are killed by Anti-Touma? Did Zombie somehow escape her Jesus treatment, or did she get killed still on the cross?</br></br>  <br>hmmm:<br> Other than the fact that <br> the format you were basing it on was much too old, what you were trying to do is very <br> similar to my plan. They are both the idea to change the world by preparing a temple <br> filled with strange power, drawing out the power of the right arm within that temple, <br> and readjusting the thickness of the phase itself with that power. How is Academy City <br> different from a small world that has sealed a certain type of power? You just need to <br> look at your own actions from a different viewpoint. Just by doing that, you should be <br> able to understand the true nature of that power. …If you had succeeded in doing that, <br> you may have reached your goal before I did.” <br><br><br>where is the goat?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well technically brown skin had one of her organs or limbs away so when her body was killed, it just regrew and now hangs with Touma.</br></br>  <br>She teaches 3 idiots who'll never pass and can do nothing about it.<br><br>Also, her line about level 0 being the key to understand esper powers makes me think she has at least knows esper development isn't ac main goal.</br></br></br>  <br>"Brown skin" isn't Zombie or Nyang-Nyang, Anon.</br>  <br>Basically Kamisato is Laura's Touma</br>  <br> who'll never pass and can do nothing about it. <br>Reminder that Aogami not passing is completely intentional because Komoe fulfills some of his fetishes.</br></br>  <br>  She teaches 3 idiots <br>More like entire class of them. Touma just lowest of the low.</br></br>  <br>  Komoe fulfills some of his fetishe <br>Who doesn't?</br></br>  <br><br>But I thought Touma was Laura's Touma, unless he's past that stage after hanging with the likes of Ollerus, Fiamma, Thor and Othinus</br></br>  Stopped reading this shit round volume 17 but has touma fucked that big titted chick with a large forhead yet?  <br><br>I know. Zombie was killed by dog we seen last volume and Nyang was rekt to death by anti touma in ecstasy.</br></br>  <br>Styil is Laura's Touma.

And even then you should just say voice actor for anime and not seiyuu.</br>  <br>I fucking wish that was the case, threads on English voice actors in dubs and shitty Hollywood adaptations have become more prevalent.<br><br>Your point is moot.</br></br></br>  <br> being so triggered about an anonymous poster using a word in an anonymous image board <br>You'll outgrown your insecurities someday anon.</br></br>  <br>who is this?</br>  <br> tbh <br><br>I appreciate the work you are doing friend.</br></br></br>  I'm pretty sure Asami Imai is a lesbian.  <br>Bit rude,tbh</br>  <br>"Seiyuu" is much shorter than "voice actor for anime", less awkward in a sentence and is already well-established.</br>  <br>Why are you so buttblasted about that stupid shit?<br><br><br>I don't want to believe this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can use VA instead. It's even shorter.</br>  <br>But you can't trigger that retard poster if you use that.<br>Seiyuu is more fun because of this.</br></br>  <br>Where do you get that impression?</br>    <br>That also applies to English voice actors, though. In fact, that's the popular term for English voice actors.<br>Seiyuu is explicitly Japanese</br></br>  <br>Not into seiyu shit. Who are they?</br>  <br>I bet the kanji for hat is even shorter, you should start using that instead since you love nipponese so much.</br>  <br> i was all alone at home in my boxer shorts, just like usual tbh <br>I got a comfy sweatpants for being a neet loser, you should too OP.</br></br>  Can you guys fucking stop sperging for a moment and tell me who the semen demons are on OP so I can fap properly?  <br>That's not how it works. You can't write the kanji directly. First you need to change the language setting to Japanese, then you have to type 'seiyuu' and then press the spacebar three times to convert it into the appropriate kanji. It takes longer.</br>  <br>Ignore the retard, /a/non.</br>  <br>Sakura Kurosawa<br>Rashomon Miteita</br></br>  When are Nana and Yukarin going to marry?  <br>way too hot for that bruh it's 95F outside</br>  <br><br>In my eyes his word choice made him look more knowledgeable.<br><br>It's faster to type "seiyuu" than "voice actress", and having two different words (actor/actress) for the exact same job, just because their sexes are different, is a failing of the English language. We don't call female doctors "doctoress" anymore.

At the very least, she reasoned, just by virtue of being there the managers and other seiyuu wouldn’t forget her. <br>http://tumblr.paranda.net/post/1058<wbr>31310531/oozora-naomi-aka-naomin-ak<wbr>a-sorasora-aka-sorachan</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Today's episode made me wonder how seiyuu feel when they learn the character they're voicing gets written off/dies.<br><br><br><br>You shouldn't anyway, the characters actually talk about the episode during the ED and they show the preview on the monitor. Honestly I love everything about the ED in this show.</br></br></br></br>  <br>SnK's OP or Hare Hare Yukai are bound to happen eventually.</br>  Oh God I feel so sorry for all of them, considering this is probably how it is in reality as well.  <br>Jibun wo</br>  This show is one of the few where I am sad that it will eventually end and there is nothing I can do about it.  <br> 2D Sugita <br>Already done</br></br>  <br><br>I can't imagine them not doing Haruhi, or at least something Kadokoawa Kyoani. Lucky Star?</br></br>  <br>HHY will happen for sure.</br>  <br> considering this is probably how it is in reality as well <br><br>considering reality, it could be much worse, like whoring yourself out to the producers etc.</br></br></br>  I wonder what percentage of the budget goes to buying rights to iconic anime songs.  <br>the only shame will be the fact that the cutouts wont party hard</br>    <br> Purun Purun Tengoku.webm </br>  I hope Futaba starts a harem with Hiroshi, Sugita, and  Wakamoto   <br>You have to buy rights even for cover versions?</br>  <br>That bit was so weird, fucking Kamiyan.</br>    <br> Today's episode made me wonder how seiyuu feel when they learn the character they're voicing gets written off/dies. <br><br>Not just that, I'd be interested how they feel when they learn what characters they'll voice at all. I know in public/marketing they all (pretend) be like "oh that's super awesome and I'm proud to be part of this exciting project", but at least sometimes somewhere in their head there must be part of it that thinks "ugh, another stupid otakubait bimbo character, gross..." (but then again there's also the "...oh well, whatever pays the bills" thought)<br><br>I mean, sure you have to have at least some basic enthusiasm for it to be in the industry at all, but I don't think they can really love everything everytime.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think you underestimate how nerdy seiyuu can be, especially the females.</br>  <br>In America you can even get sued for singing Happy Birthday without Warner's permission. Don't know about Japan.</br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if one of these girls turns out to be a fujoshi</br>  Isnella best girl  <br>Made me remember that Punch Line promo video or something, when suddenly the look of disgust appeared on one of the VAs face when she saw the show's promo art. It seems she can't contain her disappointment anymore.</br>  <br><br>Y-You're not serious, are you?</br></br>  <br>He's serious. That's why restaurants have their own "versions" of Happy Birthday with altered lyrics/tunes. <br><br>Allegedly people are paid to go around and check for violations. If they find any... hoo boy.<br><br><br>Do you have a link? I love that sort of stuff.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Do you have a link? I love that sort of stuff. <br>There was a webm, but I didn't save it. Sorry.</br></br>  <br><br>The finale could be something from Hayate, though I think none of those songs really stand out.<br><br>Other likely candidates are:<br>Haruhi/Lucky Star OP<br>Something from Macross F<br>Taiyou Iwaku Moeyo Chaos</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Monogatari or a Claris song</br>  <br>did HS hardcode the subs for sore ga seiyuu? i cant take a screenshot without them appearing and i cant remove them either. why did they do this?</br>  I can see them doing Connect maybe.  <br>funimation rips are hardsubbed</br>  <br>Funi rips will always be hardsubbed, unfortunately.</br>  <br>Jibun woooooo</br>  <br>Yeah, probably Kimi ni Shiranai Monogatari. Kinda sounds like it will flow well with the ED.</br>  <br> Monogatari <br>Renai Circulation or Staple Stable maybe.</br></br>  <br>Not big enough, this  sounds more plausible since it was huge and the single sold like hot cakes when it came out.</br>  <br>Her pain is far greater than yours</br>  <br><br><br>In episode 1 I actually expected them to launch into Renai Circulation after Cruel Angel's Thesis when I heard that SEE NOO.<br><br>Go for the anime medley.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice. Thanks a bunch.</br>  <br>pi-, pipo~~~~~</br>  <br>He'd be bald now though</br>  <br>kek the VA</br>  I like this a lot more than I thought I would.  <br>I want to see them do TTGL's OP.</br>  I guarantee they'll do Invoke  <br>KIMI TO</br>  <br> Gonzo <br> not doing Welcome to the NHK <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hHs<wbr>5AjAvFoA</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I'm going to burn down what's left of their studio if they don't sing Puzzle</br></br></br></br></br>  she's just asking to be bullied  <br>Damn that's harsh</br>  <br>Anon, you can't forget that not everybody is a self hating cunt like you though.</br>  <br> i <br>You need to start typing like a big boy and lurking for another month or two wouldn't hurt either.</br></br>  <br> what's left of their studio <br>That's not nice, anon.

I liked how they did the first episode ED's cameo song over this episode's. Today's came up more abruptly while in Episode 1 Cruel Angel Thesis got mixed in more seamlessly. That's how I felt, anyway. I liked that.  <br><br>You mean like her?</br></br>  Suffering everywhere.  <br>;_;</br>  <br>That's pretty reasonable</br>  <br>Looking at Ichigo and Rin's reaction it seems like it's not really a standard in their industry.</br>  <br><br>How so? Both this episode and the last had introductions that were exactly the same except for the name of the song. The only reason why you might think that the 1st episode was better is because the song itself flows better with the ED.</br></br>  <br><br>Good. Her voice killed me a little on the inside every time I heard it.</br></br>  <br>Literally went to softcore porn.</br>  <br>Strange that an image where everyone is smiling seems so depressing.</br>  i'm gonna feel like shit whenever a main character with a newish va dies mid-season now  <br>http://ameblo.jp/rima-nishizaki/<br> she actually had to start doing gravure to support herself <br>fuck you Gainax ;_;</br></br></br>  <br>They'll never get hired</br>  <br> The only reason why you might think that the 1st episode was better is because the song itself flows better with the ED. <br><br>Yeah, that's pretty much what I meant, really. I wasn't sure if I worded it correctly. I'm not trying to say today's song was bad or anything, if that's what you're thinking.</br></br></br>  Ganbare ringo-chan.  No one spills spaghetti like Futaba.  <br><br>Unless I have a reading comprehension problem the way you worded it says that you liked the introduction of the first one over the second one.</br></br>     Implying it's not just one monogatari episode     <br><br>I feel so bad, she's my age and I really liked her voice too.</br></br>  rip Pipo<br>rip Futabas dreams<br><br>are web radios of any note?</br></br></br>  <br>web radio is mildly popular but the girls need to be from popular shows to begin with. Futaba has a long way to go before stardom.</br>  <br>a-at least you can fap to her now</br>  <br><br>Amazing. <br><br>Loving this show so far. OP/ED are particularly good, too. I love the little weekly cover bit of the ED, cool idea and they've had good taste so far. Hope for that to continue.</br></br></br></br>   mental breakdown scene <br>10/10 Gonzo saving anime.AOTS<br><br>Its great to see the series getting picked up by many, last week thread was kinda dead,multiple deaths with not much post too.</br></br></br>  Imagine a failed seiyuu watching this while reliving their past.  <br>I hope tomato-chan gets the role.</br>  <br> buying a BD could help a seiyuu from failing and dropping from the industry <br><br>Hurry /a/, go pre-order some anime right now, you could be saving a seiyuu's career right now.</br></br></br>  <br> yfw twitter posts where seiyuu buy the BD for their own show because the sales are that low </br>  <br> Sir! We trued telling people in anime more and more to buy the BD's, but they just won't do it! They continue to use their torrenting sites and download them on the internet <br> We trued to create a law to forbid it, but the just won't listen! <br> Sir, what do we do? <br> "Then we have no other choice." <br> S-Sir? <br> "It is the only way. They have forced our hands. We must show them the truth." <br> "We must show them the Black History of the anime industry." <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=z2f<wbr>5rgTkA0I</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wonder what it means to be a successful seiyuu  I've never watched C3-Bu, but why were sales so low? Just being bland or boring isn't enough to get sales as low 250~, usually having cute girls is enough to get more sales than that. Did Japan really hate the show that much?  stupid sexy Futaba<br><br>I need to buy these printed copies somehow</br></br>  <br>It was going well for a few episodes; but, it succumbed to DRAMA out of nowhere and the MC became an edgelord. The DRAMA then ended suddenly and it returned to how it was before for the last episode. Seriously, the MC acted like airsoft was an actual battlefield.</br>  <br>You would understand if you saw the show.<br>They actually had something going there. The director had the ability to make something that would have made old Anno of Evangelion fame proud and give Gainax a new lease on life... and he chickened out at the last second. Everybody hated it, the manga got cancelled just a few months later, it was a huge mess.</br></br>  Honestly all three of them doesn't fit the roles they audienced for, i hope they fail    <br>It definitely wasn't bland or boring.</br>  <br>A summary<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5_6<wbr>LvKWy5vo</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  Does Kamiyan actually go around showing random people pictures of his cat?  <br>I looked up her profile and damn that's sad.

Be only 2d gay and for traps. I'd ram Kobayashi like a steam engine but actual yaoi digusts me. And irl traps are failure.</br>  <br>Protip: When you start feeling "confused" it's over.

You mean, pretending there is no penis? People do that?</br></br>  <br><br><br>Technically, Inga is a boy before he transforms, right?</br></br></br>  <br>The only thing it got going for it is the sexy trap. The storyline is stupid japanese edgy shit. The plot is retarded and the "murderers" are fucking braindead retards who only exists to be the pieces that move to make the murders have reason. But it's done so retarded.</br>  <br>Wrong color pallette for this show.</br>  <br> have a feminine body <br> don't wear pantsu designed for such body </br></br>    Draw a Dinosaur  <br>  Call it a Girl </br>   Draw a girl <br> Call it an alien </br>    <br>yes</br>  All MCs should be traps<br>It makes the anime so much better</br>  <br>No one cares about the plot of this show, all that matters is the slutty boy with dat ass seducing everyone</br>   jerking of to hot trap hentai <br> suddenly guy start sucking of the trap  <br>The fuck is this shit? I ain't gay</br></br>  <br>anyone who grew up in the 70s could tell you that, as the boys in the class usually had hair longer than that to begin with, I mean his is almost 'Beatle-length" there.</br>  <br>I fucking hate this shit.</br>  <br>Those 3DPD really ruin this image.</br>  <br>Reminds me I need to remasturbate to Boku no Pico.

I mean, it would be pretty funny, but still.</br>  <br>Now read Nozomu nozomi.</br>  <br>its a old Japanese man's drawing. its not actually a boy. its a cartoon, grow up</br>  <br> grow up <br>Only little girls are allowed to post on /a/, turbonerd. Go back to your gross bitch club or something.</br></br>  <br>Here<br><br>The shorts look more like boxer briefs than pure boxers, but it illustrates my point sufficiently.<br><br>Mind you I didn't bother looking very hard and literally punched "Totsuka Saika boxers" into Google.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>those arent boxers anon, those are beach shorts, they are for girls</br>    <br>Easy, get another trap.<br>This time, don't forget to use hormones regularly.</br></br>  <br>Silly anon. Little girls are allowed to fuck cute traps.</br>  <br>Girls in boxers are maximum-over-boner tier. Not enough images of guys fucking them through the crotch-hole that's usually on boxers though, which is a darned shame.</br>  <br>those are boxer briefs, but at that point, why not just wear spats?</br>  <br>Because boxer briefs allow more airflow than spats? Spats are usually made of more elastic material, are they not? Boxer briefs are usually made of cotton or some other shit as well.</br>  <br>Spats aren't underwear.</br>  <br>As far as underwear go<br> loose boxers &gt; boxer briefs &gt; nothing &gt; briefs &gt; barbed wire &gt; white briefs <br>I swear to god if someone tells me white briefs are cool, I'll dump their books. They probably enjoy shitting themselves and stroking it hard to dead animals.</br></br></br>  So this shit is just boys getting abused by dominant women for cheap sexual thrills the entire time, right? <br><br>Or does it actually develop a plot and get better?</br></br>  <br>Yes. <br>Yes.</br></br>  <br>Don't worry OP, it's not purely S&amp;M faggotry.</br>  <br>I have to agree with </br>  Bros doing bro things<br><br> This scene animated <br><br>Main reason I want to watch it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Picked the fuck up.</br>  Prison School is honestly AotS.

I almost dropped it in the first volume of the manga because it was all S&amp;M shit I didn't find funny. But it gets toned down later and it gets really good. I suggest you read the manga, it's just not the same.  <br>Monster Musume</br>  <br>why don't you read the fucking manga and find out you illiterate cunt</br>  Is it only airing censored?  <br> godly art <br> GODLY ART <br>Please kill yourself you impotent faggots.</br></br></br>  <br>If an anon can't recognize it for having good art, I will kill myself.

Its basically Green Green with more femdom.</br>  The manga is a strong 9.55/10 tbh<br><br>Fuck off secondary</br></br>  <br>Everything is better than a LIDEN Films-tier adaptation</br>  <br>Are you interested in the show?<br>Then watch it<br><br>Are you uninterested in the show?<br>Then don't watch it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tbh <br>Fucking shitposter<br> Fuck off secondary <br>And a TM fagboy tier one.</br></br></br></br>  Whenever people says<br> picked up <br>to an anime show that's adapting a manga well known in /a/, I get reminded that there exists anime-only faggots and incredibly new newfags.</br></br>  I'd rather the author finished me and the devil blues  <br>What do you think of manga only fags?</br>  <br><br>unless you're so disgusted by anime standards of today that you refuse to watch anime, who the fuck reads only manga<br><br>At least for anime-only nut-tuckers their common excuse is "lel reading"</br></br></br></br>  <br>namefags and tripfags deserve to be purged.</br>  <br> tfw some people are still putting Alex Mercer in leather pants <br> tfw some people think he had any characterization at all </br></br>  <br>Do you suffer from depression or something? Stop watching it then. Tons of masochistic retards like you seem to watch/read/play popular media that people seem to enjoy just to say "see, I told you it was shit!!".</br>  Read the fucking manga  <br> 182 chapters <br>No thank you tbh</br></br>  <br>read the manga faggot</br>  <br> gorge your eyes out  <br>How the fuck is he supposed to do that?</br></br>  <br> But I'm not laughing. Didn't even crack a smile during the entirety of the first episode. <br>Did you actually try reading the guy's post who you replied to? He said that he didn't find the beginning funny either.</br></br>  <br>Maybe he meant gorge as in feast. Like you eat so much your eyes pop out of your head.</br>   prison school <br> AOTS <br> even AOTS material </br></br>  As usual advice, if u want to enjoy the shit out of this manga, turn off your logical thinking part because it will never make any sense at all and they not gonna get any better at all up to now.<br>Second, embrace your M-side and forcefully held on it cuz if you're not there's a lot of blue deep ball waitin for ya.<br>You past those two, then you'll realize how glorious and masterpiece this piece of crap really was 9/10 topkek.</br></br>  <br>all of you fucking sub humans must realise that you must READ THE MANGA to start dreaming about thinking about becoming humans<br><br><br>also you must be a true assman</br></br></br></br>  Just looked like tumblrs wet dream, dropped so quick  It's for comedic thrills  R E A D T H E M A N G A<br>E<br>A<br>D<br><br>T<br>H<br>E<br><br>M<br>A<br>N<br>G<br>A</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  There's a lot of masochistic stuff, but rather than anything fetishistic I just find it hilarious. And there'll be more of a plot to it than just twelve episodes of ecchi Auschwitz.  <br> So this shit is just boys getting abused by dominant women for cheap sexual thrills the entire time, right?  <br> Or does it actually develop a plot and get better? <br>the manga is some of the greatest comedy literature to come out of japan EVER. and Hana is a best.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope. It is about the friendship of the 5 boys and their various hardships and trials against the underground student council.</br>  <br> So this shit is just boys getting abused by dominant women <br>Oh shit, my ultimate fetish. You just convinced me to read this.</br></br>  <br>McNig you gotta tone it down on the masochism man,   just kidding I would give my left nut to be one of the five male students. </br>  <br> tfw you will never be tied up, beaten and beheaded by pic related </br>  <br>Censored garbage<br>its great for a harem though</br></br>  <br> Censored garbage <br>as opposed to Prison School? More shafts of light! MOAR</br></br>  <br>This</br>  It's a comedy with cheap sexual thrills.<br><br>What "plot" are you actually looking for? I mean they already said they're desperate for girls since they turned to co-ed.</br></br>  <br>As long as nipples exist, I don't care.</br>  So how are the estimates ? Is it flopping because of the changes?  <br>Nipples?</br>    <br>If only she wasn't a slob</br>  <br>Probably terribly because of this garbage adaptation.</br>  <br>if you didn't laugh you should stop watching<br><br>I laughed, so I'll keep watching<br><br>simple really</br></br></br></br></br>   All the main girls somehow are martial art monsters <br> Dumbass plot and characters <br> excessive violence toward boys. <br>Usually all of those point is red flag for me but somehow i just cant help myself.The only thing that made me keep going is somehow the boys are self aware of their own masochism so its funny i guess. Also the bromance and comedy here are painfully gold.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>blah blah buy the BDs blah</br>  <br>It's a comedy. Why are you asking for some complex plot?<br><br>Well, the status quo changes quite a bit, so you have that to look forward to.</br></br></br>  <br> beheaded <br> not wanting Valmet to break your neck first </br></br>  <br>   They get girlfriends. </br>  <br>Its a comedy anime.<br>The things they do is ridiculous,the reasons why they do it is ridiculous,the whole setting of the anime is ridiculous.But its funny as hell.<br>So don't try to find some reason or logic for every fucking thing,its a anime.Just watch it.</br></br></br>  <br> don't have time to read manga <br> have time to watch anime <br> despite the fact that reading manga is overall faster because of lack of animation and because the characters talk as fast as you can read <br><br>You're not the brightest in your family, are you?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Since when "tbh" is considered cancerous, what the fuck. It's the same as "mfw" and "tfw", it has always been here.<br><br><br>In other news, manga &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anime because QUALITY. Also Hana a best.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuuuck.<br>One thing's for sure,<br>my dick will still be hard long after I'm dead.</br></br></br>  <br> AotS <br>Wait.... an Attack of the Show anime? Odd, but I'm sold.</br></br>  <br>Plot? Nigger this manga has the best fucking plot you'll ever see  Ifyouknowwhatimsayin' </br>  A year ago, I sae a post recomending it but I didnt find it interesting at plain sight. (Didnt read the manga by that time).<br><br>This year the anime comes out and its all censored. <br><br>  Had a few laughs (dunno if the studio is doing a shit job adapting the manga). <br>  I dont like so much S&amp;M  <br>  The design and drawing style are not that good IMO <br>  The guy with the small face... just WTF <br><br><br>Still many of them recommend it with all their soul. Stopped reading manga when the blond guy betray the group.<br><br>Will it get better? Should I give it another chance?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Eventually it panders to scat fetishists.</br></br>  <br>Not that guy but although I do agree with the manga part<br>  it has always been here. <br>is not true. tbh hasn't always been used and it actually only in the past month/couple of months started being used together with "smh" and "bae" mostly in ironic shitposting. <br><br>mfw and tfw are a bit older, but if you were here you would remember that they were also met with hostility when people first started using them. (Funny enough they also started being used as ironic shitposting but I guess they just caught on eventually)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Note: I'm talking purely about the shortened versions "&gt;tfw nogf" that started out as ironic shitposting, not "my face when" as a whole.</br>  <br>I suggest finishing Boys' Prison arc and then deciding, if those bro moments and lewd comedy were keeping you entertained. If not, drop it.<br><br>I began reading this as an S&amp;M enthusiast, but stayed for laughs and manly friendship.</br></br></br>  <br>Rest in peace G4.<br>Wonder what Olivia and Kevin are up to now</br></br>  <br><br><br>Kevin is doing the same thing, just online.<br>twitch dot tv slash theattack<br><br>I know he also hosted the Nintendo World Championship at e3.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Really hoping they compile the chairman's ass adventures into an OVA  <br>Olivia is going to be Psylock in X-Men Apocalypse<br><br>She sucks cocks in her free time</br></br></br>  <br> sucks cocks in her free time <br>was there ever a time when she didn't?</br></br>  <br> being this retard <br><br>READ THE FUCKING MANGA<br><br>MANGA<br><br>M<br><br>A<br><br>N<br><br>G<br><br>A</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's a fucking comedy. There is something like a plot later but if you don't find the jokes funny you might as well drop it.  <br>she's in better circles now so less smegma and genital warts</br>  <br>"tbh" is /sp/'s replacement for "ayy lmao" and thereby their new favourite way to mark their shitpostings. By no means is "tbh" an innocent abbreviation.</br>  <br>The best part is when the main character watches that one woman piss on the grass.</br>  I'll probably get shit on and have my taste question but I honestly find the anime more humorous than the manga. It just feels like the message is delivered better with motion than still images.  <br> a true assman </br>  <br>pz nigga, /sp/ isn't important enough to have memes<br><br>much less cross board butthurt</br></br></br>  <br>das a doujin... right?</br>  <br>Yes.<br>sadpanda.org/g/785065/8a872340da/</br></br>  <br>ushio to tora<br>monsume<br>charlotte<br>gangsta<br><br>'sabout it</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> monsume <br> any relevance at all </br></br>  <br>Read the manga.</br>  <br>Jitsuwa<br>GATE</br></br>  <br> Jitsuwa <br> aots </br></br>  <br>We can all agree that Game of Laplace is aots.</br>  <br>Literally everything, because Prison School sucks so much.</br>  You must be gay or a moeshiteater if you dislike Prison School.<br><br>Its really about a bunch of friends having fun at school</br></br>  <br>I can see animeonlyfags disliking it. First Ep was shit.</br>  Have you praised for PBR-sama today, /a/?  Enjoy it in its true glory, manga. Also, Hana belongs with Kiyoshi. Chiyo can gtfo.  <br> Little does gakuto know there was a dick in that thing minutes ago </br>  <br>Some scenes were funnier in anime form, honestly.</br>  <br>Slut Chiyo &gt; Hana</br>  Sounds like fun-hilarious kind of trash, I should pick it up.  <br>Slut chiyo was probably one of the worst mini arcs in the manga and made me dislike her character. Maris naivety made that shit tolerable.</br>  <br>Anime form: funnier in some scenes but less intense scenes<br>Manga form: still the best</br></br>   tfw   asked gf to pee on me because of the manga <br> im single now <br>the fuck was I thinking</br></br>  <br>Nice job shingo.</br>  Fuck off secondary retards.  <br>At this point why would you run to read the source just so you can experience redundancy with the anime? May as well enjoy being surprised while it lasts.</br>  <br>Did you have a bottle? This an important question.<br><br>You must have made a mistake along the way.</br></br></br>  <br>Doesnt work unless the girl is extremely into you.</br>  <br>can you imagine how stupid that conversation might be<br> so hey, do you love me <br> yea i do <br> like really, really love me <br> you want to do anal, right <br> no, not anal, i dont wanna do anal, unless you wanna do it, then i wanna do it <br> if its not anal then what is it <br> ok, right, heres the thing, have you ever heard of golden shower </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>how can slut chiyo arc be bad? it developed characters and showed sides of them we haven't seen before, what was your issue with it?</br>  <br>Slut chiyo was fine but she did her makeup with a sharpie. tbh, wished she stayed with the twin tail look.</br>  <br>Precisely because it developed characters in a good way except chiyo. Here we see her delve into madness because she has extreme trust issues and always draws her own conclusions without looking at the whole picture. At first you think oh this could be it, some development between her and MC, NOPE. She is instead immensely more concerned with her sisters honor and reputation than anything. Her and MC developed more as friends than anything and that is disappointing with the way the MC idealizes her so much.</br>  <br>the trick is you need to find a girl that's more fucked up in the head than you</br>  <br>Wait.<br>You don't like slut arc, even though it has development just because it's not the development you wanted?<br>Good way =/= what you wanted. Chiyo was shown to not be the angel kiyoshi imagines, she has trust issues, overreacts, etc. Kiyoshi was also developed to be more than just a pervert, since he didn't fuck her when he could. You can even say it was hinted that chiyo might like kiyoshi, even if the focus of slut arc was her deal with mari. Also, mari's hypocrisy was further stressed. It had interesting development, just not the one you wanted.</br></br></br>  What is it about midweek threads that turns them into a hotbed of cancer shitposting compared to the weekend ones?

I mean that shows her standing on her two feet making decisions for herself. <br><br>Would the author want Yukino to leave? I understand fully well the the series isn't about romance but rather growth but I think it might be possible that 8man might just take Hiratsuka's advice of: caring for someone just means that you're ready to hurt them, and pick one of the heroines if he realizes his feelings for either one of them.<br><br>What exactly is an "Oregairu" ending?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Would the author want Yukino to leave? <br>Lazy ass character development time skip ending purposes</br></br>  <br><br> What exactly is an "Oregairu" ending? <br><br>In spring time of their third years.

Things like pausing the scene to go to a washed out 30 second still of whatever was happening while dialogue and action continued was comedy genius. Also the Hot Sister was the best character I liked how she turned out to be an exhibitionist for all of ten seconds and it was totally irrelevant to anything.  <br>Yeah It's aight.
