[ Who do you think is best girl?  Sephie&gt;Mikado&gt;Tearju&gt;Ren&gt;Diarrhea&gt;U<wbr>nderage girls</wbr>    Momo: She was my favorite when she was introduced. Now she has become ridiculously lewd and horny girl who seems to be losing her sight on her harem goal. Best girl for all your sexual desires. Nothing more than that.<br><br>Nana: Tsundere of the series. That makes her cute. I'd take her over Momo if she wasn't in so much denial about her liking Rito.<br><br>Haruna: She had her charms initially but she is too shy. 11/10 shy. Not my girl<br><br>Yami: Personally prefer herself from Black cat series. She had better personality there.<br><br>Tierju: MILF, no more than that. Like Yami, I prefer her self from Black Cat series.<br><br>Nemesis: Eh, not too fond of dark skins. <br><br>Yui: Prude girl but I like her for strong girl personality. But she does try too hard to show her self as a strong girl. Relax a bit and I'll consider<br><br>Mikan: Best sister in the series. Strong girl for her age and has mature mind set. She would win my vote for best sister.<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128396302#p128415662">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> <br>Welp I meant Sephie not Euphie.</br></br>  <br><br>Did you seriously write all this, or was it just copy pasted?</br></br>  New trailer http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>yu0mj_boruto-movie-new-trailer_tv</wbr>  <br> transforming their eyes like that would change the way the current rules work. <br>this is kishi we are talking about.</br></br>  dubs  <br> The reason everyone is questioning it is because Kishimoto admitted that they don't have Byakugan because he just plain forgot <br>He was joking. He just doesn't like the way it looks and thinks it's hard to draw, so he decided not to give it to them.<br><br>But I guess he still liked the Gentle Fist fighting style enough to give it to him. And if he gets Sage Mode then he'll be even better at it than a Hyuuga. Also his slaps will hit with the force of a mack truck turn people into frog statues, so there's that.</br></br></br></br>   actually talking about this shit <br><br>What the hell is wrong with you faggots? Nothing in this series makes sense anyway and that kishimoto faggot doesn't give a shit about it. Not to mention that this Boruto shit is absolutely fucking retarded.<br><br>You faggots are the cancer killing /a/.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I went. It was mostly what you'd expect: 20-30-year-old guys in jeans and dark t-shirts. There was this one woman though, who looked like she was 45, but she was dressed in gothic lolita. It was disgusting.</br>    <br>she needs to guide your hips</br>  <br><br>is she the persona girl that keeps her huge tits hidden?</br></br>  <br>go to tumblr and complain about that.</br>  <br>Not Persona or SMT<br><br><br>Her issue will probably revolve around being a halfie child and shuttled between estranged parents, or the foreigner parent not being in the picture.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it is going to be something about her parents I just don't know what</br>  ITT: worst girls  <br> I know. </br>  <br>So true. She's like that one kid you see at the mall begging his parents for a toy and then, when they refuse, start to destroy everything while crying like a bitch to embarrass his parents.<br><br>But it's still fucking hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think there were any good girls in A/Z, but all she had to do was come out and say she was alive and the war would have stopped</br>  <br>crab doesn't look like that.</br>  <br>Well, obviously. If Crab looked like that, that would be a picture of best girl and therefore off-topic for this thread.</br>  Why aren't there many women who have casual sex in anime? Not all anime is for kids, right? The protagonists of this show have sex on the regular and the show is great. I just don't see why it's such a rare thing when sexual attraction is important in many anime.  a surprising number of sexperts in the anime subsection of 4chan...<br><br>is it just the that panty and stocking creates alpha males?</br></br>  <br>Well, you haven't met me. ;^)</br>  <br>More like all 3D people are like that, only you don't realize that you're exactly what you hate.</br>  <br>That's all 3D people though.

Is Karera dead?  i always wondered if araki's random changes in the story like hanged man and sand mans stands, or anasui's gender were because of araki or his editors  gg subs, I kekd. need moar whyyyyyy  <br>That classic biceps pose Star Platinum does in that JoJonium cover is embarrassing.</br>  How would Sex Pistols Requiem help Mista erase the number 4?  <br>Requiem does what the persona needs most<br><br>Kira needed a way to get rid of people trying to find his identity without anyone knowing<br>Giorno needed a counter to Diavolo<br>Pol needed a way to protect the arrow, but died right when it was created so it went haywire</br></br></br></br></br>  Why couldn't he protect her smile?<br> This got really depressing REALLY fast. </br>    <br>Looks like it'll have to wait until tomorrow morning to get read.</br>   OP dumping in his own thread <br>Pretty sad way to try and generate discussion by doing this.

As a child I really liked SW as well, precisely for the reasons you gave, it's just that as I grew up I grew less fond of so many things in the movies (Plot, characters, etc.)<br><br>There are so many great things about the universe it has established and it shows with everything the franchise has spanwed (Games, Lore, etc.). Only later I realized that these reasons are what happens in my head and not actually in the movies. There are many great things that can be done with this franchise, but for me, these things never happened. But that's more subjective.<br>What I mean that there is nothing to get out of Star Wars except your usual: "Good will prevail" stuff.<br><br><br>I knew someone would make that comparison. Kaworu is similar to Boba Fett in that regard that he is barely a character. He is more or less a plot device. The difference is that Kaworu actually represents a theme, so his very brief and less developed appearance is justified in my book. Boba Fett is just there.<br><br>His huge popularity isn't justified. Or at least not if the reason why you like him is because you think he is a "well written character". If you like him for what he represents, then that's a different matter. Similar too Boba Fett. If the reason why you like him is because you think he is a great character, then you are wrong. If you like him for very superficial reasons, then it's somewhat ok.<br><br>I cannot forbid people to like things and I am in no position to tell others what is the right thing to like and what is wrong.<br>But the reason why I like Eva is not Kaworu, but everything about it and Kaworu's part was very important for what Eva did, so I can see why people like him.<br>With Boba Fett I can "somewhat" see why people do, but I think the reasons are worse than those that exist to like Kaworu.<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128407102#p128415730">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Kurumi is love Kurumi is life  <br> You will never be the stable and reliable person who helps calm down her murderlust <br> Kurumi will never stop sneaking out at night to commit wanton violence after you chew her out for making you worry </br></br>   TFW She would ignore you completely cause you're not Shidou   <br>Okay so this may sound like a weird concept but...does anyone else think it'd be a cool idea for these harems with unnecessarily large casts to do like...matchmaker arcs where girls get paired off to other male characters to kind of thin the herd?</br>  I'd rather a Tohka, but I definitely wouldn't complain a Kurumi.  <br>Tohka is a very strong female lead.
