That's why it was AOTS.

Are they hacking the Matrix?  <br>Not him and you have a good point but Sound! Euphonium does sound pretty dumb</br>  Aside from Kyoani yuribaiting that never went anywhere then a solid 8.  <br>Ping Pong is a pretentious, ostentatious aesthetic abortion with pretentious, cliched characters, pretentious, cliched character development and a pretentious, cliched plot.</br>  SSS/10 feet would fap to this image again  I liked the show but I wouldn't give the show a rating that high. For one, the show tried to appeal to both hetfags and yurifags and failed to fully pander to both.  <br> implying that Sound Euphonium isn't </br>  <br>Not a 10/10 but a 9/10 yes</br>  fuck <br>meant for </br>  <br>Not enough variation in buzzwords.</br>  It was shit.

Dem speculars, man. KyoAni is God.</br>  <br>I just watched it and thought it was a nice, simple sports series with an emphasis on being visually unique. The five main characters were pretty basic archetypes, and we got to see how they all came together and ultimately grew up from their experiences. Not top ten worthy or anything, but definitely worthwhile viewing.</br>  hibike had beautiful visuals, but the history didn't went to anywhere  <br> visually unique <br>Is this codeword for "looks like it came out of my ass?"</br></br>  <br> Someone post the webm of Kumiko running and crying <br>Please don't remind me how awful the backgrounds were.</br></br>  <br>You need to have a watched more than 20 anime to post here Anon</br>  Yep  <br>Depends on who's shit we're talking about.</br>  <br> Baccano <br>Kill yourself, Baccano is the most overrated garbage on /a/.</br></br>  8.5/10  <br> the history didn't went to anywhere <br>Dude, what?<br><br>Everything about this image is delicious, but damn, Hazuki is pure fucking sex.

I'm no dickrider for this show but come on, like half the focus is on Taki-Sensei beating discipline and skill into the band, not to mention the actual ending.</br></br>  <br>Objective fact.<br><br><br> AOTS's </br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PyS<wbr>AKyyZVv8</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Reina sounds like Marina Inoue when she sings</br></br>  <br>It can be, but I liked, not just how the characters were designed an animated, but the little stylistic choices, like setting it up like comic panels.

Actually, don't. Keep posting feets.</br>    <br>I'm not so sure about that. Now that I think about it, wouldn't it be Animes of the Seasons? How do you abbreviate that properly? Just AOTS doesn't seem right because that usually means Anime of the Season here so that's unnecessarily confusing.</br>  <br>I agree because it made fun of del/u/sional scum. Boring otherwise.</br>  <br> Animes of the Seasons <br>Wait, fuck me.<br> Animes <br>I have no idea what's going on right now. So it's Anime of the Seasons. Or, AOTS's, as the apostrophe is properly used to replace "eason." So  was correct all along. Fuck me.

Good thing I marathoned this.  <br>I guess so.<br><br>Weird enough, I generally don't dream about anime but I'm glad I didn't forget it as I usually do.</br></br></br>  The character designs were shit so it was a terrible anime.<br>I'm glad it flopped.</br>    <br>Best show of the season with the worst threads of the season.</br>  <br>I can't filter cancer threads like this if you use it Sound Euphonium, please use Hibike Euphonium.</br>  <br>Fanbase easily 0/10 that's for sure.</br>  <br><br> footfags <br> not the furfags of softcore fetishism <br>Why does everyone refuse to chase you subhumans out?</br></br></br></br>  <br>AOTS</br>  So is Euphonium a meme anime?  <br>If you've ever been to any major city at night, it looks similar to that. I believe it would be like Tokyo during nighttime.</br>  <br><br>Samefag</br></br>  <br> meme anime? <br>You're going to have to define this shitposting term before we can answer your shitpost.</br></br>  I can safely say Hibike was my AOTS.

I hope we can get a S2.<br>Speaking of that, how's it looking so far?</br>  <br>More like 4/5.</br>  <br> poorly paced <br> pretentious  <br>I'll give you repetitive but that was literally the point. That show's a masterpiece.</br></br></br>  <br>Oy vey, does Mr. Shcneider have to educate you on why feet are the master fetish and armpits and navels should fuck off to /d/, foot-hating goy?</br>  <br>I think this is waht you called half igonorance half bait</br>  <br> I still gotta finish Plastic Memories to get my final say but I doubt it will be better. <br>Don't watch after the credits. Trust me. Don't do it. You'll completely ruin it for yourself. I'm serious. Don't fucking do it. Just pretend nothing happens after the credits and leave it like that.</br></br>  Why do all the shitty, pretentious hack shows always pander to footfags? Are they that desperate for sales that they'll appease a group that won't support them in the slightest and just move onto the latest shitty shounenshit adaptation? If so, then it never works.  Tell me what you think about this  It was like a worse version of Free, so no, it wasn't 10/10  <br><br>Here's your reply.</br></br>  So when did you guys drop Hibike?<br>I dropped it 5 minutes into episode 13.</br>  Can you fuckers remain in your generals a while longer?

Hibike did absolutely nothing better than Free.</br>  <br>There's no reason the S can't just stand for seasons, plural.</br>  <br>The Fall of 2015 hasn't even happened yet, how are you going to assume something's just going to be the best?<br>Kill yourself you biased retard.</br></br>  <br>Though. things could've been even better</br>  <br><br>At least you got your bait. No way Kyoani will go full yuri.</br></br>  <br>People have been baiting using Kyoani shows to bait for a few years now. Even though the company's last good idea was tamako market's ending song.</br>  <br>There is. AOTS, as commonly used here, means "Anime of the Season." Abbreviating "Anime of the Seasons" the same way is needlessly confusing. Replacing a letter or a block of letters is a perfectly appropriate use of an apostrophe, so I think AOTS's is more appropriate for the sake of clarity.</br>  <br> still forcing the HIBIKEK'S FOR US FEET CHOSEN PEOPLE meme <br>When will you footfags take a hint and off yourselves?</br></br>  <br>What do their feet smell like?</br>  <br>He didn't say anything about feet.

"Resound Euphonium" doesn't sound any better than "Sound Euphonium". Asuka also mentioned that Euphonium was derived from Euphonos, and she defined it as いい響き, and that the Euphonium makes a good sound.<br>I'll take Sound over Resound if it's an equally valid translation, and I also find that the word 'Resound' tends to give me strong impression of 'making an echo'.<br><br>Here's Daijirin's definitions:<br>ひびき【響き】<br><br>①<br>音や声が広く周囲に伝わって聞こえること。また，その音や声。 「太鼓の－」 「雷の－」<br>②<br>音が物にぶつかり，はね返ること。反響。 「 －の良いホール」<br>③<br>発音体が振動をやめたあとまで残る音。残響。余韻。 「鐘の－」<br>④<br>その音を聞いたときの感じ。 「 －の良い名前」 「迷惑そうな－があった」<br>⑤<br>伝わってくる震動。 「地（じ）－」 「レールに伝わる列車の－」<br>⑥<br>影響。 「円高の－」<br>⑦<br>世間で取りざたすること。世間の評判。 「宮の御心ざし，世の御－煩はしうおぼされたれば／栄花 見はてぬ夢」<br>⑧<br>蕉風俳諧の付合方法の一。前句の切迫した緊張感を受けて，打てば響くように<wbr>応じて付けるもの。 「今はうつり，－，にほひ，くらゐを以て付くるをよしとす／去来抄」</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  would have been better if they played their instruments with their feet  <br>Not even Top 10 in its season.</br>  <br>Definitely yuri.

Like you're telling your eupho to resound.</br></br></br>   shitphonium <br> anything other than polished turd <br><br>Well meme'd my friend.</br></br></br>  <br> Hibike over KinMoza </br>  <br> putting Euphonium in the same class as Graffiti <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>KinMoza got dull fast this season, other than Karen</br>  <br>It still fits the image way better than Hibike does</br>  <br>It was boring, and not in the hyouka meme sense.<br><br>I don't think I would've watched if not for how FUCKING CUTE EVERYONE WAS HOLY SHIT<br><br>One of the problems I have is though, when something is actually good, you don't mind experiencing it again with a friend. I don't think there's any additional joy to be found rewatching.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> anime with a friend <br>Is this a thing that people do?</br></br>  I can't wait for season 2.  <br>Did you find it more boring than Hyouka? Because there was a clear sense of progression rather than Hyouka just dumping the progression at the end<br><br>I don't see how people would get bored of Hibike</br></br></br>  <br>I just find highschool bitchiness boring, and that's about all this had besides cute music and occasional yuri undertones</br>  It was shit, KyoAni's worst by far<br><br>Gave it a 4/10</br></br>  I kind of wonder actually, are all the kids getting better on their own outside of rehearsal or are they taking some kinds of lessons? Some of them clearly have been for a while, Asuka, Reina, probably Kaori too have definitely taken lessons, you don't get as good as they are at brass playing without guidance in high school.  <br>is their any romance in this anime</br>   little girl with a giant bass <br> not one "dropping the bass" joke <br><br>I came into this for one reason and left thoroughly disappointed</br></br></br>  <br> rather than Hyouka just dumping the progression at the end <br>heh<br>I think you missed a bit on your watch anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Of the 100% hetero, straight variety.</br>  <br>Not really anime per se, just anything whether it be a movie, activity, a meal, etc. if you want to share it with someone, it's probably good.<br><br>Boring is probably not the greatest choice of words, it's more like I felt really detached, un-engaged. It's hard to really be bored when it looks and sounds beautiful. The plot didn't really do anything for me, especially since I have experience being in a top band, as well as a shit one.</br></br></br>  <br>You didn't figure out that there was a gradual undertone of a lot of folks, especially Kumiko, really starting to get into music and want to get better? Was that not a huge thing for you?</br>  <br>I guess, but it's something that is present in basically every anime that isn't a harem<br><br>it wasn't handled especially well and nothing about it made the series good</br></br></br>  <br>does the main chick in OPs pic end up with someone?</br>  <br>We're terrible unalike. I've made music my career through band and the plot did amazing things. The focus was never on the predictable "Kitauji is bad but they're getting good and will triumph in the end," it was always on the characters as they dealt with their own things. <br><br>It didn't slap you in the face with how good the ensemble became, it worked itself up as a gradual journey that was the only possible progression.</br></br></br>  <br>She starts dating a background character two seasons from now.</br>  <br>do we see any romance between the two?</br>  <br>I think they talk once or twice</br>  <br>well maybe not dumping it all at the end, it's just the progression was completely shown in the last two episodes, where it shows how Satoshi and Oreki have changed from the start. The development happened throughout the series, but it was more subtle than Hibike</br>  <br>Depends on how strong your goggles are.</br>  <br>goggles?</br>  <br>How experienced are you in working with districts with bad music programs? Because often they go the Taki-sensei route <br>  and more often than not they stagnate and remain perpetually mediocre  </br></br>  <br><br>She ends up with trombone wiener boy. Kumiko is supposedly attracted to him but Kyoani downplayed it and amped up the yuri bait.</br></br>   tfw hibike threads will quickly be like current k-on! threads   <br>I'm not exactly sure how the relates to my post, actually, beyond that it's band-related and it's a fairly accurate statement. <br><br>Hibike is a work of fiction, and there were clear enough signs that regardless of whatever Kitauji's result was, what mattered was how the students lived through it.</br></br></br>  <br>If you want to see their interactions as romantic, you'll see them as romantic. If you don't want to see them as romantic, you won't.</br>  <br>I should mention one thing realistically portrayed was how the senior members basically dictate the culture of the band.</br>  <br> Not noticing buchou's buchous </br>  <br>Which is also very true. But the fact is in your own statement you admitted yourself that the Taki-sensei route only most of the time leads in stagnation. This was always going to be a realistic story about one of the times the route was successful.</br>  It was pretty good and I enjoyed it thoroughly, but it was an 8/10 at the very best.  I miss her already.  <br>This one's a joke, right?</br>  <br>What an awkward angle to hold your leg at.</br>  <br>Bronze is proper shit, if it's anything like a Fair or Good rating. To have it turnover so fast was pretty meh. Of course, that wouldn't be the most entertaining route to go with. <br><br>But it takes enjoyment out of the series knowing exactly how it will end. And I mean knowing from my own experience, not just from knowing how fictional plot work.<br><br>  especially when you repeatedly go to state, and you get to feel that sometimes judges flip a coin, I'm looking at you jazz state judges  <br><br>It's just not rewarding to see it play out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Was it good? yes. <br>Is it worth a 10/10? No.</br></br>  Will there ever be a season 2?  <br>My understanding was that the medals were related to the placement at the competition, so only the top scoring ensemble would get a gold. In other words, Bronze would have actually been somewhat decent, just not too great.<br><br>And in any case, believe me when I say a year can make all the difference. I've seen groups jump several levels between years, and also drop even more, and that's just with concert band. The effect is even more pronounced if you follow marching music.<br><br>Also, another sign of differences. knowing how something will end (read, basically the same as being spoiled) does kind of suck, but at the same time, that also means you aren't as focused on what the plot's play out is, but rather HOW it gets played out. I don't see how Hibike is dull because of its ultimate predictability in a facet of the plot, that I again reiterate, was largely inconsequential in its actual result.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm literally 99% certain Hibike will get season 2.<br>I'd love a season 2 of Amagi too, but I doubt it will ever happen. It's not a Kyoani property, they just made it as a favor to an old buddy, and it didn't sell that well.</br></br>  <br>If it sells well enough, yes. Likely no though.<br><br>Maybe a recap movie is more likely, although there probably isn't much else to cover.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh look what a surprise it's all moeshit</br>  <br>There should be, though that'll probably end on a bit of a hang itself and we'll never, ever get a 3rd season because why would KyoAni do a 3rd season of anything?</br>  <br>They could make season two be two cour, enough to cover volumes two and three.<br>It wouldn't be the first time Kyoani made a two cour season two sequel to one cour season one.</br></br>  <br><br>Why are you guys not spoiler-tagging what they got?<br>They did not mention how many gold spots there were in the nationals, more than one for sure. Regionals had 6 spots (out of 3 which would go to nationals)<br><br>But let me say this, while I can't remember the total number of high schools in the competition. Kyoto prefectures were about high 20s. Regionals was 27. Nationals was 29. They got bronze in the Nationals, which means they are still among the top 29 schools in the whole of Japan!! <br>For the first year that Taki took over, and given the quality of the crop (respective school level attracts respective quality of the junior high kids that choose this school) and the 'amount' of practice the 2nd and 3rd years had previously, that's freaking amazing even if it was bronze at the nationals! Remember that they got golds in prefectures and regionals xcuse me compared to previous year bronze at the prefectures. So top 29 at national level is definitely not "not too great".<br><br>The story is also not about getting gold at the nationals (and they also did meet their goal in reaching it anyway); this is not Shounen sports or Kuroko hehe. What matters is the growth of the characters; what comes full circle for Kumiko as "the most average person in the story" when she learned the chagrin of not getting the 'top', compared to what she felt at the start of the series in the prefectures, and the inheritance of the "Sound Euphonium" piece from Asuka at the end of the epilogue. It leaves readers the feeling that everything has come full circle but this is not the end of their story.<br><br>Looks like I broke my own rule of not giving spoilers on /a/.<br><br>novelTL<br>Also in volume 3</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I am such a n00b on /a/. I clicked the spoiler checkbox but it didn't highlight it in black?<br>So sorry.</br></br>  <br><br> Baccano <br><br>  </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah it was pretty good. I appreciate that all the girls were all 100% straight.</br>  <br> all the girls were all 100% straight <br>There's at least one certified lesbo.</br></br>  <br><br> not ribbon <br><br>You messed up</br></br></br></br>  <br>More like 11/10</br>  <br>You sir i like you</br>  9.7 Best New Anime  <br>She should have been the MC.</br>   Hibike is not exactly trying hard to be about music. It is still 90% moe and 10% everything else; meaning that the aesthetics are still overshadowing the themes, to the point the latter cannot be called subtle as they can be called minor.  <br><br> The Hibike cast is moeblobs with some personality, that don’t really behave like teenagers but rather like pampered children from some model agency. The Beck cast are the most emotional ones, as well as the closest of the three to what actual teenagers feel like: Angsty, angry at everything, and insecure. Nowhere near as much sugarcoating, and far more about the chaotic emotional state they go through. <br><br> If anyone disagrees with this description, is only because he is mesmerized by the pretty colors or for some reason he spent his adolescence in a utopian society where teenagers look like Barbie the musician, who never get angry and eating cake solves everything </br></br></br></br>  It wasn't even the biggest musical Spring seller. That would be the superior Show by Rock.<br><br>Sure is /u/ in here.</br></br>  <br> Sales = Quality <br>Sure thing, buddy.</br></br>  <br> arguing subjective opinion vs objective fact <br>Sure thing, buddy.</br></br>  <br>Your objective fact is irrelevant to the quality of Hibike! Euphonium, retard. Why don't you tell us how Sword Art Online is in the top 35 best anime of all time.</br>  I don't get the appeal of the story or characters at all.  <br>More like 7/10, which is better than most Kyoani and stuff currently airing.<br><br>Also &gt;&gt;&gt;/MAL/</br></br></br>  <br>please quantify quality so I can measure it, subjective-kun.</br>  <br>nice pretending, but of course mods would allow you degenerates autists to fuck up with something, right? Can't be helped.</br>  <br>Nobody said quality was objective, you're the only fucking retard trying to suggest it is by claiming a show is better because it has more sales. How about instead of posting things that are irrelevant, you try actually discussing what is relevant when talking about the quality of a show. Explain how you think the characters, animation, and music are superior in SBR than Euphonium instead of your assbackward assertion that sales = quality.</br>  <br>In terms of yurishit?</br>  <br>facts are based on measurable quantities<br><br>opinions are intangibles that can't be measured<br><br>logically speaking, only one should be used to determine an unknown such as "quality." can you guess which one it is? you have a 50/50 shot here subjective-kun.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're a fucking retard.</br>  <br>surrender accepted</br>  <br>Nah.

This episode especially, with the ruler game and Hotaru going for a walk doing a good job of driving home the kind of lives the characters live in their rural village.<br><br>The entire stargazing scene was also delightful. The episode had a good mix of comedy and slice of life.</br></br></br>  <br> Anyone else kind of not enjoying s2 that much so far? <br>Not really.

So opened last ep and skipped to this weird scene.<br><br>Does the whole series have the same trippy dream like feel this part did? If so I'll definitely watch it.</br></br>  Suck my dick nigger boy  <br><br>Can you be more specific?</br></br>  its good  <br>suck my COCK dude</br>  <br>Wow you are such a faggot.</br>  <br>Why</br>  <br><br><br>What a tragic human being. Get back in your autism hole. Cancer.<br><br>Anyone else?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Clannad <br> opened last ep and skipped <br>Wait, so do we do the complimentary Nagisa thing now or does that mean you already know</br></br></br>  <br>I'll plug your autism hole with my wiener<br><br><br>he doesnt know that nagisa dies, probably opened the last ep of s1 like the faggot he is</br></br></br></br>  Anyone else feel like the illusionary world bullshit was just a huge waste of time?  No the whole series doesn't have that feel. <br>It's good though, worth a watch.</br>  <br><br>I have no context for the scene so I don't know what I was even seeing. From what I saw she basically gave a robot life in a world without any.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it's more important for the VN, but the show would've been better of they'd cut it and not had that retcon at the end.</br>  <br><br> he doesnt know that nagisa dies, probably opened the last ep of s1 like the faggot he is <br><br>I do that a lot actually as it's good for getting an idea whether a series is worth it. Also, you're a social reject but don't tell anyone.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What retcon? Been a long time now but I can't remember.</br>  <br>I make 600k PER HOUR and have 40 girlfriends dude. If anything the social reject is you. Faggot.</br>  <br>Nagisa and Ushio coming back to life for a happy ending.</br>  <br><br>Read this child. Btw your WoW gold doesn't count.</br></br>  Seems the thread got killed by socially inept cancer whose only skill in life is parroting "Boko no pico" because it's "the cool thing to do". So I'll leave it at that.  <br><br>Oh whoops I got confused between this thread and another one where someone was talking about Sharin no Kuni, so thought you were talking about that...</br></br>  <br>watch, or watch not! there is no explaination.<br><br>if you'll be able to catch the idea of the show depends on our cognitive setup.</br></br></br>  <br>I read the VN, haven't actually watched the anime but it still felt like some pointless shit that was shoehorned in to make the game seem more "deep" or something, that really wasn't needed. It gave some context to the light orb shit, but that also was something I feel the whole thing would have been better without (besides maybe as a minor easter egg/progress indicator on the title screen)</br>  Why aren't we talking about best show of the season?  im eating  Waiting for BR.  Dragon Ball is pretty great yes  <br>how good are those dicks anon</br>  We've had numerous threads about Akagami though  <br>I really wish the pacing wasn't so goddamn fast. So much of what makes Prison School so good is the build up and tension. Hopefully it's just the first episode which is really fast.</br>  <br>Because it's shit.</br>  Too bad it takes fanart to make Yuzu's riding suit look decent.  <br>I think that  because us ritual fags just try to believe that we have a chance while Sawatari fags literally think that he will get relevant and make some excuse whenever he job.</br>  <br>I really didn't like Soul Drive.</br>  <br> Both of them are as delusional as one another. </br>  What?! Them not having level doesn't mean their level is 0!?  <br> Actually believing that Rituals has a chance </br>  God Eater Episode 1 thoughts?<br><br>Firstly I would like to say the animation looks really weird and not weird in a good way.</br></br>  <br>It's fully handrawn.</br>  Man the Summer manga is so shit, I can't even appreciate the ecchi when it's so badly drawn<br><br>Any manga that focuses on Alisa moe and has good art?</br></br>  <br>Oh god my ears</br>  <br>They drew over 3D models. They didn't use the real model.</br>  <br>Females and teenagers isn't "the Japanese".</br>  Are there any shows like SAO where it doesn't turn into a shitty love story after the first 5-6 episodes?  <br> are there any shows like SAO that don't turn to shit after the first 5-6 episodes <br>Fixed that for you.</br></br>  <br>responding to your own comment, 2/10</br>  <br> are there any shows like SAO that don't turn to shit after the first episode <br>Fixed that for you.</br></br>   SAO <br><br>Yet another anime that doesn't just have otaku pandering, it's built around otaku pandering<br><br> I'll go live inside my MMORPG and I'll have superpowers as fuck and everyone will look up to me and I'll save everyone cause I'm the man </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>...<br><br>that might almost be a worse suggestion than boku no pico according to what the op asked.</br></br></br></br>   2015 <br> still no Evangelion of the 2010s <br><br>Why is it taking so long?</br></br></br>  <br>i think you forgot  to check em </br>  <br>If you mean popularity and sales wise, the 2000-2009 winner is probably Code Geass</br>  <br>because it's shit anime</br>  <br>Haruhi was the EVA of the 2000s.</br>  Must have been in a coma during 2011.
