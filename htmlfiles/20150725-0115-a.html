He's always been a one joke character, but at this point, he is literally just a (secondary) plot device.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm fine with having a moeblob, but I'm not fine with taking an okay character and turning it into a meaningless moeblob, it's just poor writing.<br>But both her and Andre will probably have their former selves return during the cavalry battle</br></br>  Best grill  <br>The holding hands and taking pictures is what sold me.

I was surprised how funny it turned out to be I'm loving it right now.<br><br><br>He actually is, No one even comes close to him. Truly the best.</br></br></br></br>  During their time in prison do you think that the boys would masturbate in their beds or you think that they waited until they got into the showers? I would imagine that there was a chance that the USC would have caught doing that at some point.<br><br>It was never really addressed , but I imagine that would have become an issue at some point. Too bad they didn't go there. It would have been amusing if Hana caught Kiyoshi doing that instead.</br></br>  <br>Probably in the beds.<br><br>The showers are way too open.</br></br></br>  <br>So it was a case of everyone hearing each other &amp; just not saying anything out of courtesy?</br>  <br>Of course. It's like what happens in real prisons.<br><br>Besides, you can learn to masturbate quietly in certain situations.</br></br></br>  <br>what would stop them from masturbating in the shower? they fucked in there once.</br>  <br>It happens in army too.

I know it won't be soon. <br>Btw, the site is working and the scans will be on weekends said the member of MT.</br>  <br>Read the manga if you haven't already, otherwise you'll just get spoiled</br>  <br> 815x873 <br> Wallpaper <br>Your phone wallpaper, right?</br></br></br>  <br>Just finished catching up to the manga last week. How often is this updated? I used Batoto to read it, but are the any better sites?</br>  <br><br>Once a week.</br></br>  <br>  I used Batoto to read it, <br>So, you skipped 9 chapters?</br></br>  <br>use mangapark, also good, u can scrool down all pages, don't need to load every page.</br>  <br>I went to a different website for those. What was up with that anyway? I usually don't see Batoto slack like that.</br>  <br>I don't use Bato and didn't see that they were skippin some chaps... Probably cause so much teams were decided to work on this and then quit. really dont know.</br>  <br>You can use a tampermonkey script to do that with every site though.</br>  <br><br>/a/ did those chapters, the scripts atleast. Utopia probably got mad and skipped them entirely.</br></br>  <br>Those chapters were up at some point by both /a/ and utopia. Batoto took them down for other reasons.</br>  <br><br>Utopia is weird and deletes the chapters from batoto themselves after some weeks, I see one chapter being ereased when another one gets uploaded. Same reason why they wait a week to upload their chapters to batoto when they are alredy on their site, just because they feel like it</br></br>  <br>I don't get it any of that tampermonkey but thanks anyway. Now i'm out.<br> <br>and who cares what batoto did to them? Surely they need more cleaning :D</br></br></br>  <br>I'd let her pee on me. Kiyoshi is such a faggot. She's fucking gorgeous.</br>  Meiko's transformation seemed really sudden in the last chapter.   prison school thread <br> no one is still talking about the best man <br><br>plebs</br></br></br>  Why did the prisoners do not fight back?<br>Even a weakling like I can beat loose 95% of the women out there.</br>  <br>But then you'll just get expelled and miss the wet t-shirt contest.</br>  Want to watch it so bad but I'm waiting for the BD's, can't handle the light beam cens.  <br>This is 100% correct, except I move Meiko down two places</br>  <br>You're forgetting that they actually like having contact with living, breathing females.</br>  anzus fucken hot as shit in the ed  <br>He's the third-worst character though.<br><br>First and second are the new Andre and Meiko.</br></br></br>  <br>Despair but also an erection.</br>  I want to  fuck  Hana.  new chapter fucking when ?!   we need a new thread as soon as the last one dies guys! <br> ghost town <br> where are the raws/chapters/subs? questions <br> x is hot posts <br><br>Yeah, we sure needed another thread.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's not much to discuss in the downtime between chapters, shitposting is all that's left for some people</br>  Hana is okay but you fucking piss fetish shipper faggots need to calm the fuck down about her.  <br>I don't get why people associate piss fetish with Hana (Hanafags are totally different beasts). She doesn't even like getting pissed on</br>  regarding the latest chapter, is hana not wearing underwear  <br>Tucked into her crack</br>  a vote for but tucking too  <br>That is arkueid though.</br>  <br> Why did the prisoners do not fight back? <br>Hana is a martial artist, Meiko is a freakishly strong titty mutant, and Mari is the older sister of the  first  girl that MC has a crush on + the chairman's eldest daughter.<br>The boys would lose. Meiko solos 4/5 in under a minute and then beats on Andre until he passes out  from pleasure </br></br></br>  <br> Hana is a martial artist <br>I am master in black belt<br> Meiko is a freakishly strong titty mutant <br>And I have a cock that can easily make her surrender.<br> and Mari is the older sister of the first girl that MC has a crush on + the chairman's eldest daughter. <br>I don't care, and it seems the chairman wouldn't care as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wooow, good for you! Aw shucks, if only everyone could be as AWESOME as you are! But golly gee gumbo, that doesn't sound like any of the boys in Prison School at all, and that's what the question and my answer were all about! All they have is a shitty four-eyes, a shitty hoodie with sandpaper for lungs, a shitty delinquent, a shitty dumbass, and a shitty fatass masochist. But then again, maybe you could apply! I'm sure they could find room for an arrogant dipshit who can't into reading comprehension!</br>  Anyone else find the anime funnier than the manga?  Only a few more hours.  Fuck me in the ass this is the best manga I've marathoned in months. And no, I didn't pick it up because of the anime but you can think whatever you want.  <br> i am master in black belt <br>what does that even mean are you a master at being a black belt or just being retarded</br></br>  <br>THIS MANGA ALWAYS PISSING ME OFF</br>  <br>Why?</br>   no decent hana wallpaper <br> no good large resolution pics to print out and put on my wall <br> no good daki pics to use <br><br>Why even live</br></br></br></br>  so did everyone forget that mari had crow powers wtf was with that  <br>GODDAMIT OP<br>just let this die</br></br>  <br>I think she's not using them because the ASC "killed" crows to get Mari (or was it Meiko?) in trouble.</br>  <br> not liking the Chairman <br>Dude's BOSS.</br></br>  I keep hearing about this series but know nothing about it. Please give me a quick summery of the first few chapters.  <br>they like to think she has a piss fetish, but really it just shows how far she is willing to go to finish something. same reason mari asked her to hate her. I don't believe she actually has a piss fetish, I think she just dug herself too deep and her pride was too strong for her to back down. Now that shes even with kiyoshi, I'm hoping a better relationship will develop. (it wont, some stupid embarrassing shit will happen and the cycle will start again, but hey.)</br>  <br>The first few chapters are pretty good. And then chapter after chapter of nothing. I was pretty upset. The quality of the art does a nosedive too.</br>  <br>Well you see, there's this school. But not just an ordinary school! It's also a prison!</br>  <br>oh gosh. what a twist!<br>well, better start reading Prison School</br></br>  <br>I understand. But what happens to the people there?</br>  <br>nothing happens in this series</br>  <br>Nothing?</br>  <br>it's almost entirely filler</br>  how is the anime compared to the manga? i've been liking the show so far<br><br>i don't really give a shit about the censorship, so if that's the only reason to read the manga over continuing with the show i'd rather just keep watching it.</br></br>  <br>Why read it then? Is it good fap material?</br>  <br>kind of I guess? I may be being kind of unfair though considering the stuff I usually enjoy is stuff like pun pun or ressentiment which aren't exactly average in quality. The first few chapters made me think it would be going in that kind of direction when it's actually just kind of run of the mill.</br>  <br> girlfriend <br><br/></br></br>  <br>So you guys only read it still because it has fapping material?</br>  <br>Shit man, thanks. Never noticed that. And I wondered why the fuck the principal suddenly woke up in a hospital without anything really happening prior to that.</br>  <br>I read this before they skipped those chapters, interesting.</br>  <br>Yes. I suggest you to try avoiding all prison school related, based on that anon said. Because it's so shit it's not worth seeing.<br><br>If you see those daily live translate thread, or the anime thread, avoid it. If the page or webm looks interesting, still avoid it. It's exactly like that anon said, it doesn't goes anywhere.<br><br>please just trust that anon, don't try to read it, and avoid anything about prison school.<br><br>You're welcome.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>     "i'm not a slut, i'm a bonafide virgin" <br> gives it up to kate so easily, without breaking a sweat <br>did this break anyone else's immersion or am i missing something<br>like, she blushes around kiyoshi every time he does something cool, so why would she do something so out-of-character?</br></br></br>  <br>idk maybe because she felt so much more superior to kate</br>  <br>You have to do that kind of shit if you plan on seeing things through anon, sometimes for a plan to work right you'll have to act like a different person.</br>  <br> implying she's not a virgin  <br>It's lesbian 'sex', nothing was penetrated there.</br></br>  After 10 years i'm seriously excited on a manga, and the weird part is that: i really don't know why..<br><br>And i never have read seriously a ecchi because i find most of them boring..</br></br>  <br><br><br>but, the fact she went so far was immersion breaking. i can't put my finger in what exactly it was. couldn't she just have let her suck on her tits at the most? she went all the way for a video that could have been something so much less</br></br></br>  <br>She was recorded doing the ouroboros with a guy, anything less than basically fucking each other doesn't cut it.</br>  She can pee on me anytime  <br>Why does she look like KanaHana?</br>  <br>she's fanservice until she returns to her former glory.</br>  <br>I CAN'T FUCKING WAIT<br><br>that's my favorite scene in any manga, ever.</br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't mind her if she could actually function like a person, I mean fuck. Can she do anything right?</br>  <br>Evil, that's what Mari is. You know to bet on Kate instead after seeing her Saruman (this means sorcerer/wizard actually) powers.</br>  <br>Funny how the mc pretends that he doesn't want her but he can barely handle himself when they're alone.</br>  <br> That one bitch who likes Joe's ants <br><br>her name is diamond-san now. she used to be cupcake bitch, but she's attained true idol status. <br><br>also, almost perfect ordering. 9/10. Principal is better than Joe or even Andrenomics andre.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's giving a Nicholas Cage expression actually.<br>Someone do a quick shoop.</br></br>  <br> no decent hana wallpaper <br><br>I am working on hana vector art<br><br>just be patient</br></br></br></br></br>  what chapter has the hand holding scene?  <br>115-116</br>  <br> no decent hana wallpaper </br>  <br> decent </br>  In few more hours expect the chapter 185 on marumaru  <br>ETA?</br>  <br>sorry I don't really know time zones, but from now 2-4 hrs, and then it takes time to find translator so in 4 to 6 hours will be translated.

Be honest /a/.  It can always be worse.  <br>To be honest he already has, both him and Ace never felt like actual characters at least to me personally.</br>  Who was Mr 9? Did he ever reappear in a cover story or something? He semeed like he was a good friend of Vivi.    <br>Let's talk about some of the best writing<br><br>For whoever hasn't read it yet: this recent article on the OnePiecePodcast website is probably the closest to the true underlying story of the series than anything else<br><br>http://onepiecepodcast.com/2015/07/<wbr>22/the-one-piece-connection/<br><br>Long as fuck but worth the read. Covers the Will of D, the voice of all things, the moon, the Void Century, the ancient weapons and a few other things</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If only there was some kind of wiki or search engine to find out such details.</br>  <br>Oh right fuck I forgot that was him. I only remembered Miss Monday appearing on a cover.</br>  <br>we already had this thread yesterday</br>  <br>Its completely fine and I don't see what the problem is</br>  <br>Yeah, like the 4chan One Piece thread where most people have very good knowledge of the series and it could even spark an interesting or fun discussion.</br>  <br>I need REVEALS already.</br>  <br>What are the probable better excuses beside amnesia?</br>  <br>this was a really good summary and speculation tbh</br>  <br>No, it actually was the best option, everything else would have caused too many plotholes for Oda to ever fill. And it is not even bad writing, it is just pretty cliched.</br>   anon   <br>Amnesia is always worst plot device but considering Oda used it for the first time in 800 chaptes I'm okay with it. <br>I would have like it better had Sabo been on a secret mission somewhere, isolated from everything, far away from marineford and with no access to any news whatsoever. But this works too.</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=p98<wbr>Wp2wZEnw</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>No. It was the best option for the situation. Negated possible plotholes. Blah blah blah, we already had this thread pretty recently faggot.</br>  <br>Trusting in Ace like Luffy did back at thriller bark while going on a important mission for the revs OR being completly rekt after a mission and even having scars from it during the entire ompel down/marineford chaos.<br><br><br> And it is not even bad writing <br>It's literally hurr durr amnesia for no particular reason besides filling the plot hole of not helping ace</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You really don't see what the problem is with the old "character shows up who is a close friend to but didn't have any connection with the main character so far in the series and just happens to have had amnesia so that he did not appear in the plot at any other point where it would make sense" plot?<br>Is that not a bit too convenient for you? For someone like Oda who foreshadows like hell, this is pretty weak.<br><br><br>He was injured badly doing revolutionary stuff so he could not come to help Ace.<br><br>Don't really have an explanation why he wouldn't contact Luffy and Ace though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> considering Oda used it for the first time in 800 chaptes I'm okay with it <br>This is why I'm also okay with it. As long as it is kept to this singular incident, I'm cool.</br></br>  <br><br>I think you might be surprised with what we already know and have been told without realising it.<br><br>I still think one of the greatest hints of the series is on Volume 27's cover. It's Oda all over.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Certainly. Such a small and seemingly miniscule change in Luffy's design but possibly explaining one of, if not THE, biggest mystery in OP.</br>  <br> Gedatsu vs. Senor Pink never <br>There is no god</br></br>  <br> It's literally hurr durr amnesia for no particular reason besides filling the plot hole of not helping ace <br>that does not make it bad writing. it would have been bad writing if it would have caused more plot holes or if it would not make any sense.</br></br>  <br>That reason and the whole sakazuki thing makes it not bother me.</br>  <br>I just read through the whole article.<br><br>Seems legit. I think the biggest problem I'm finding here is absolutely no explanation of the Devil Fruits. Not even a hand-wavy explanation. They're obviously important to the series, and are as big a mystery to the characters in the series as they are to the reader.<br><br>Also, there's a lot of baseless speculation like "All of these races came from the moons". While it's a nice theory, it really has fuck-all backing it up. Some pictures of moons in no way indicate that dwarves/giants/longecks/longarms/mi<wbr>nks/etc. came from various moons. That's a crazy stretch to make.<br><br>It's really clever, though. I liked it. I really enjoy the fan theories. One Piece is an impressively large world that has really rich lore. Oda really fucking knows how to do worldbuilding.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> for someone like Oda who foreshadows like hell, this is pretty weak. <br>D: Hello Oda Sensei! Is it possible that in volume 58, chapter 558, on the 3rd box of the 11th page, I see the 3rd person (Sabo)'s cup? P.N. Saitouryu<br><br>O:Wow- again, looking at those teeny parts. The answer is easy, if you read chapter 585 in this volume, you'll see the same scene and you'll be able to tell it's Sabo's cup, but at the time in chapter 558, "Brothers", if I revealed Sabo, things would get complicated, so I secretly drew it. Still, from back then, there were many readers pointing out "what is this", and I seriously freaked out. What in the world are you people!! You're correct!!</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's convenient writing which makes it so bad as there was no reason for this cliche to show up for such an important character</br>  <br>That's not what bad writing means.</br>  <br> convinient writing in a battle manga for kids <br>oh god help us</br></br>  <br> 558 <br> 585 <br> foreshadowing 27 chapters is amazing xD <br>No</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oda foreshadowed Sabo since Alabasta.</br>  <br><br>Maybe you didn't realise it yet, but One Piece is one of the best or even the best battle shounen out there. You expect better things for it than you would for shit series like Fairy Tail.</br></br>  <br>Yes, as you just showed, he is good at foreshadowing. So why did he have to give Sabo amnesia rather than, well, giving him a good and plot-relevant reason why he couldn't show up?</br>  <br> implying Odas writing never was convinient at any point before  <br>are you deluded or something?</br></br>  <br>Yes. And amnesia is a really weak excuse, especially for Oda who, as you pointed out yet again, is pretty good at foreshadowing.</br>  <br> Seems legit. I think the biggest problem I'm finding here is absolutely no explanation of the Devil Fruits. Not even a hand-wavy explanation. They're obviously important to the series, and are as big a mystery to the characters in the series as they are to the reader. <br>I think it's mainly because we've got fuck all to go on. The most we've learned about them in years was with Smiley at Punk Hazard.<br><br> Also, there's a lot of baseless speculation like "All of these races came from the moons". While it's a nice theory, it really has fuck-all backing it up. Some pictures of moons in no way indicate that dwarves/giants/longecks/longarms/mi<wbr>nks/etc. came from various moons. That's a crazy stretch to make.</wbr> <br>I agree. That's about as fanfictiony as it gets. I like the idea but it's entirely baseless. I was just saying that in the other thread, I'm not sure that the Ohara model is anything to go by. If something happened to the moons, it happened during the void century and was covered up. Currently the only moon in the sky is Fairy Vearth. If they were doing their research in secret in the basement, they wouldn't have a fuck off huge model in the main hall that exclaims WE KNOW SOMETHING WE SHOULDNT. Truth is, we don't know anything about the Ohara model and it could be something else entirely. All that we know for certain is that there is one moon.<br><br> It's really clever, though. I liked it. I really enjoy the fan theories. One Piece is an impressively large world that has really rich lore. Oda really fucking knows how to do worldbuilding. <br>Oh definitely! Of all the stretching that it does, I'm totally in for the Punk Hazard/Elbaf/Uranus link. That's just the kind of easter-egg you don't know that you're seeing that Oda loves. Other than that, the D/Moon People theory seems pretty legit from what Greg said. I suppose it's just interesting when someone manages to put it all into perspective</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Never this badly.</br>  <br>then tell us a good reason that leaves no plot holes besides amnesia</br>  <br>Because he was lazy and wanted to create a simple explanation that doesn't warrant further questioning.<br><br>Not guy you're replying to, but hey. Oda clearly had other shit to deal with that wasn't coming up with an interesting/complex but understandable reason for Sabo to not contact Ace or Luffy before now.<br><br>It was bland, lazy, cliched, and uninspired, but it did the job.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not even the worst part.<br> i forgot everything <br> okay let's give him back to the parents <br> N-no actually there's this instinct i just awakened and shit that tells me to not return to my parents <br>Really Oda?</br></br></br></br></br>  Favourite foreshadowing?<br><br>The kids talking about Doflamingo's awakening attacks about 30 chapters before the reader will understand what it properly means</br></br>  <br> Don't really have an explanation why he wouldn't contact Luffy and Ace though. <br>And this is what you just can't cover with anything else but amnesia. <br><br>Why are people so butthurt about it anyway? Getting amnesia after being blown up seems pretty reasonable to me.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Considering one of One Piece's major themes is<br> Man only dies when he is forgotten <br>And a major fucking plot point of Dressrosa was the tragedy of forgetting your loved ones with the toys and shit, I'd say it's not that much of a hurr dur plot point considering that. It's cliche and convenient, yes. But it fits well with the theme of the arc and honestly it's pretty tragic you heartless plebs. Luffy and Sabo's reunion was pretty touching too.</br></br></br></br>  Will Rebecca join the SH crew?  <br>The story of One Piece would be fundamentally different for there to be no plotholes without the amnesia thing.<br><br>So it is Oda's fault if he really did plan so far ahead for Sabo to appear and then write him in with such a cheap trick.</br></br></br>  <br>Please god no</br>  <br> Favourite foreshadowing? <br>Luffy defeated Mr.3 using unawakened observation haki.</br></br>  <br>(G)Oda theres the G.</br>  <br> plot-relevant reason why he couldn't show up <br><br>There's your problem, it wasn't that Sabo wasn't there at Marineford, but the whole life he went missing without trying to contact neither Ace, Garp, Dadan or Luffy.</br></br></br>  <br>No but she will join a gladiator crew as professional cumdumpster,she's used to it anyway</br>  <br>After Monet.</br>  <br>One of my favorites is Rayleigh first appearing in Chapter 19.</br>  <br>I'm totally on board with there being six moons, with a seventh orbiting one of the other six, and all but one is destroyed. I feel like that might be a good way to explain a bit of the world's fucked up shit. It makes more sense than say, Oars Sr. moving continents. He's large, but he's not that large.<br><br>But yeah, it seems we both agree that there's a lot of stretching for things due to lack of information. I'm hoping they're right on some of this stuff, like with Uranus/Elbaf/Punk Hazard. It might just be a weapon that creates giants. They're pretty fucking terrifying.</br></br></br>  Why didnt Luffy sink when Higuma knocked his tiny rubber ass into the ocean?  <br>That is not foreshadowing</br>  <br>Come on now. Luffy's always had good instincts but it's most likely not a haki instance.<br><br>It's possible he was considering a version of haki around that time to get it ready for Skypiea though, so perhaps.</br></br></br>  Reminder that he is Rayleigh's brother.  <br> characters appearing before a proper introduction is not foreshadowing <br>Why even ask the question then if you're forcing your own definition upon everyone else?  That's mostly rhetorical. </br></br>  <br> Tonfa Mace <br>I will never understand why Gin thought that would be a good weapon.<br><br>You put 2 shit tier weapons together and you get even more shit.<br>Gin has shit taste.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>hes okay though because Gin never shouted his attack names like a dork</br>  <br>Nothing foreshadows him meeting with the strawhats. It's not foreshadowing of anything.</br>  <br>Yes it is.<br> When Shanks and Buggy were first revealed to be part of Roger's crew, a fan asked Oda in a SBS question if the man that scolded them was a subordinate captain under Roger that commanded the ship they were sailing on, or even a high ranking officer. Without giving away Rayleigh's name at the time, Oda responded that this man was none other than the first mate of Roger's crew. Oda also stated in his response that since he had set this fact in stone from the very start, he told Toei Animation that when they adapt Buggy's flashback for the anime, Buggy and Shanks should not refer to Rayleigh as Captain in the anime. </br></br>  <br>Thats what happens when you write yourself into a corner, there are alot more options as to what oda could have gone with. but no matter What he chose. people were going to bitch about it</br>  <br>What the fuck, this tenryubito seems like a cool guy. Unless he's a civilian in disguise. Yeah, that's more likely.</br>  <br>Fine then. Luffy tackling Smoker's back using unawakened armament haki in Alabasta.</br>  <br> And a major fucking plot point of Dressrosa was the tragedy of forgetting your loved ones with the toys and shit, <br>The fact that Sabo was introduced in this arc, damn. Whether it was on purpose or not, that's a nice touch.</br></br>  <br> there are alot more options as to what oda could have gone with. <br>then tell us, so far nobody could name a convincing alternative that does not leave any plot holes</br></br>  <br> It was bland, lazy, cliched, and uninspired, but it did the job. <br>The job is to have a good story. Not just have a logical story. So, yeah, it made the story work, but it didn't make it good.<br><br><br>So why did he plan so far ahead then? Surely he could have come up with something better. He controls what is happening.<br><br>Sure, getting amnesia might be reasonable. But a good plot is not about wether it would make sense in the real world. It is about how well the plot points are connected.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't bother trying to prove him wrong. That guy won't accept anything other than his own opinion.</br>  <br>Yeah, there's no guards shoving everyone to the ground or anything. It's weird.<br><br>I feel like even if he were a civilian dressing up, people would freak out and bow anyway. Then someone would discover he's a fake and he'd be murdered.</br></br></br>  <br>Since Fishman Island, we can probably get a lot more from this page than we could.<br><br>Ship on the right? Pluton<br>Sea Kings underneath? Poseidon<br>Green thing on the left? Uranus<br><br>It's crazy how much story that Enel cover story has in it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Im more curious as to how God tier Haki users ever get contained or captured. its fair enough with devil fruit users as Seastone weakens them. but can you guys honestly tell me anyone above Rob Luccy level without a devil fruit could be contained?  <br>easy<br><br>Sabo is the pandaman. The new one. Dragon was the first one</br></br></br>  <br>over here retard  </br>  <br>Funny</br>  <br>A story that isn't logical is never good. Even One Piece, with all its kinks and weird stuff that happens isn't an exception.</br>  <br>Impel Down was full of non-Haki using shitters and DF users, so I imagine most of the presumably few Haki users are dicking around on the outside, like Rayleigh.</br>  <br>My anus is not green.</br>  <br>I said "convincing alternative that does not leave plot holes" you stupid fuck</br>  <br>How would you know ? Did you check ?</br>  <br>This  post pointed the plothole within, retard.</br>  <br>At least those replies are more foreshadowing than your post.</br>  <br>Non of them leaves any plot holes you autist<br><br> inb4 hurr durr why didn't he contact ace and luffy <br>Because he has his own fucking life as a rev and all of them had their own adventures to do. That's why Ace didn't take luffy with him to fight BB.</br></br></br></br>  <br>read the last sentence faggot</br>  <br>-He was locked up. On a mission in a far away country and was , so he didn't hear about it.<br>-Was too far to travel and didnt make it in time<br>-Dragon forbid it as he didnt want the revilutionaries to be involved more then Iva allready was. or Dragon had a speciffic reason (god knows with him as we know nothing about him or his motivations)<br>-Off tranning on a Island like Luffy was where he could get no news from the outside world<br>-Injured in a battle and was unconceous, then tried to go but was too weak. Again Dragon forbidding him from going.<br>Should i keep going or what?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> characters appearing before a proper introduction is not foreshadowing <br>No? That doesn't foreshadow any event. If any character hinted at him reappearing later it would be,but as it is it's just a character that will come back later.</br></br>  <br>That's not true though, is it?</br>  <br><br>see , it's literally not a plot hole if we follow the known one piece logic autistic mach 20 reader.</br></br>  So it's pretty obvious that Dragon's gotten a Crow devil fruit from this chapter.  <br>I never said a story should not be logical. A story should be logical. But just being logical is not enough for making a story good.</br>  <br> Because he has his own fucking life as a rev and all of them had their own adventures to do. <br>yeah, he would totally just fuck off with the revs withouth telling Luffy or Ace goodbye or anything. THIS is shit writing.</br></br>  <br>That's not very convincing. And it's not a hurr durr.</br>  <br>There's a difference between "not taking your kid brother along in a duel to the death" and "not telling your brothers you are alive for over a decade"</br>  <br> The kids talking about Doflamingo's awakening attacks about 30 chapters before <br> the flashback was almost a year ago <br><br>Jesus Christ</br></br></br></br>  Sabo should have never existed. What a horribly boring Mary Sue.  <br>Are you fucking serious? haha, holy shit</br>  <br>Ace hadn't seen Luffy in 3 years yet he went out of his way to meet Luffy even though he was on a mission for WB. Yet you tell me Sabo not getting in contact with Ace even though he hadn't seen him in 15 years and knew exactly where to find him makes sense ?</br>  <br>Even if you don't have a power, seastone is still hard as fuck.</br>  <br>No less than skewering punishment.</br>  <br>You so stupid.</br>  <br> yeah, he would totally just fuck off with the revs withouth telling Luffy or Ace goodbye or anything. <br>He did say goodby through the act of sailing out you retard di you even read the manga?<br><br><br><br><br> implying Sabo would go all the way back to east blue for that without knowing where luffy is now exactly <br><br><br>Ace was almost at the same destination as luffy and not doing shit around the new world as sabo obviously did.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Granted there was Mangellan guarding it. but i find it really hard to understand how there has never been someone strong enough to escape before luffy. Its not like Haki is a new concept to the world. It fully seems like there are people who can simply not be contained.<br>-Garp<br>-Shishikubai<br>-certain giants<br>-Yonko</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>These only explain why he could not be at MF you fuck, the more important part is why did he not contact Luffy or Ace in 10 fucking years or did not even say goodbye to them before leaving with the revs.</br>  I'm more curious to know why/how Sabo, of all people, ended up becoming the Revolutionary Second-in-Command.  <br>Fine. Suppose my anus is green. Then your head looks like my anus.</br>  <br>holy shit you make me cringe, just stop</br>  <br>Yeah, but that's an actual foreshadowing. Something that was actually mentioned ahead of the time of it's reveal. It's just as much foreshadowing as Rosinante hiding on the cover of 691, 70 chapters before his introduction.<br><br>You shoehorning haki in, earlier than it was in the series isn't foreshadowing. Your fanfiction isn't haki. Mantra is the earliest version.</br></br></br>  <br> yeah, he would totally just fuck off with the revs withouth telling Luffy or Ace goodbye or anything. <br><br> "not telling your brothers you are alive for over a decade" <br><br>From Sabo's PoV Ace/Luffy would've never thought died, and before he left he sent them a letter saying goodbye and declaring that they'd meet again someday out on the sea when they'd all become strong pirates</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He would have come to Logue Town with Dragon.</br>  <br> I have no arguments  <br>Good for you</br></br>  <br>and you think considering Sabo's character he wouldnt have contacted any of them to at least tell them he was alive? Are you retarded? Or do you not give a shit about consistancy in character and plot and only care about m-muh unique plotlines hurr durr</br>  <br>Im pretty comfortable with it being Revolutinary reasons. YOU FUCK<br>After joining Dragon his cause was greater then finding Ace or Luffy. When all 3 of them agreed on walking their own paths anyway. its not like Luffy and Ace were exactly trying to find each other EVER unless a speciffic reason like Ace knew Blackbeard was hunting Luffy</br></br>  <br>Oda could have just using one of those faces as Rosinate design.</br>  <br>Sea prism stone is also rare as fuck, and getting enough to construct a cage out of is really tough. If you do get a cage like that, odds are you're throwing a DF user in there, not some asshole.<br><br>Besides, I wouldn't be surprised if Mihawk (and eventually Zoro) could cut through it.<br><br><br> implying Sabo would go all the way back to east blue <br>At any point he could have gone back, sent a letter, you name it. Ace took time out of chasing down Blackbeard to GO BACKWARDS THROUGH THE GRAND LINE just to say hi to Luffy.<br>That shit is not a cakewalk.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because he is strong?</br>  so, I'm rereading the aftermath of the marine ford arc and one thing came to my mind<br>how in the fuck did law managed to get out of the calm belt without help?</br>  <br>No. Conqueror is the earliest.</br>  <br> After joining Dragon his cause was greater then finding Ace or Luffy. <br>that would contradict Sabos character completely. I hope you will never write a story.</br></br>  <br>He was probably just a no-name before the war.<br><br>After he heard of Ace's death and got his memories back he probably trained and got strong as fuck.<br><br>And in 2 years he became the number 2 in the Revolutionary.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He would have come to Logue Town with Dragon <br>Literally nothing suggests that. Nothing suggests that Dragon knew that luffy us there and nothing suggest that Dragon always goes with Sabo on missions. Even dressrosa shows that sabo CAN head out with his own crew.<br><br><br> them to at least tell them he was alive? <br> Sabo knew that they the one guy saw him dying and told ace/luffy <br>No<br><br><br> Ace took time out of chasing down Blackbeard to GO BACKWARDS THROUGH THE GRAND LINE just to say hi to Luffy. <br>Nop, he was searching BB that was his primary goal. He just happened to end up near the place luffy was at, he did not at point think that he should forget BB and rather search luffy by taking another direction.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> your head looks like my anus <br>Go home Sanji.</br></br>  <br>He has a fucking submarine. These things move on their own. <br>Also they probably got a snake from the kujas to scare the sea kings away. Or maybe the Kuja crew just accompanied them with their ship until they were back in the GL.</br></br>  <br>Ace, Sabo and Luffy were talented and strong as fuck for little kids their age</br>    <br>you don't have to sail through the calm belt to get to marine ford</br>  <br>Debatable. We aren't even sure that it was intended to be Haki in the first place. It could easily have been badass stares down big monster trope.<br><br>The earliest confirmed Haki use is Mantra, and it seems highly likely it wasn't intended to become what Haki is today.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm posting from my home, silly.</br>  <br>Shanks in chapter 1?<br><br>It's entirely possible. But it's just as possible that it's a retcon. He was developing a power for a long time before he came to the haki we know today. Going through mantra which obviously became Observation and douriki which is a failed and possibly scrapped idea</br></br></br>  <br>...after receiving training from the Revolutionaries, yes.<br><br>It's more curiosity wondering how Sabo was chosen instead of Ivankov or someone else who had been around longer.</br></br></br>  <br> that would contradict Sabos character completely. I hope you will never write a story. <br>Wasnt Sabo leaving on his own anyway? only leaving behind a letter? faggot.</br></br>  <br>You do to get to Amazon Lily</br>  <br>He was already chief of staff in OP's flashback.<br> the chief of staff woke up ! </br></br>  <br>he was strong as fuck for a kid. <br>Do we know how long Ivankov was in Impel Down? I don't remember, maybe that's why sabo got his position</br></br>  <br>yeah but his submarine wasn't fucking made of sea stone and I don't think the kujas did any of that given that he left shortly after rayleigh got there <br><br>yeah, you have to in order to get out of amazon lily as the map you posted shows though</br></br></br>  <br>No he wasn't.<br><br>You literally have no proof of that.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Probably because Ivankov was in jail and left for tranny island when he got out.</br></br>  <br>He has a submarine. I'm sure he could have just went straight long enough to get out. And since it's a submarine, it's probably Super High-Tech and he probably got it as a gift from Doffy who asked Vegapunk to make it with Seastone covering.</br>  <br><br> and I don't think the kujas did any of that given that he left shortly after rayleigh got there  <br>Your headcanon. Just because it wasn't mentioned doesn't mean it didn't happen. The Kuja did escort them to the island, it's likely they escorted them back to the GL. It's the most likely explanation.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm sure he could have just <br> it's probably <br> and he probably <br>Jesus christ all this forcing and guessing</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, we only have guesses. What's our point?</br>  <br>Sabo and Ace were on the same tier of stupid-strong as kids<br><br>Sabo, like Ace was, is a monster</br></br></br>  i bet Nami is a spy of the Revs and betrys luffy for sabo  <br>Did you fucking expect Oda to show up and speak moon to you ? Get the fuck outta here.</br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>How much are you willing to bet?<br><br>How about... one million?</br></br></br>  <br>Don't respond to obvious shitposting, baka. He's probably the same fuck who claims females can't use haki.</br>  <br><br> Maybe <br> Probbably <br> Could have <br>Just type "in my opinion" faggots wel all know its your headcannon bullshit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sabo had WORDS for Dragon <br><br>aw shit</br></br></br>  <br> inb4 hurr durr niggerstream, shit translation, post raw, you don't know nihongo </br>  <br>Holy shit, that made me laugh harder than it should have.</br>  <br>I can't even read the translation because its so shit.<br>He was most likely Chief of Staff of Fodder.<br><br>Stop trying to fuck my thunder I felt so fucking good writing that post.</br></br></br></br>  <br>"in my opinion"</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>Not that anon, but if you know it is headcanon and guessing, why do you need him to state it?<br><br>Calm your tits, holy damn. You're 8/10 mad right now and a 3 would be the maximum for a situaton like this.</br></br></br>  <br> a sentence with those three words surely must be a fact! <br>Are you kidding me ? How the fuck could you come to that conclusion when I purposefully used ambiguous words ? It's obviously a goddamn guess. No one said it was canon, you cunt.</br></br>  <br><br/></br>   Akainu: You’d better make amends before you show your face here again, Fujitora! // I won’t let you set foot in a single Marine base until you bring me the heads of Straw Hat and Law!!! <br> Fujitora: ......No problem at all!!!! <br>So he decided too leave the marines right there and then?</br></br>  <br> WAIT SAUCE? <br>My keks have exploded</br></br>  <br> you cunt. <br>Your trying to force it as whats going to happen or what the explination is. Fuck outa here CUNT</br></br>  <br>I hope. And get replaced by Momousagi.</br>  <br>Man, I just took a poop and was greeted by some fucker who thinks I speak for Oda. <br>Glad someone got a laugh out of it.</br></br>  <br><br>Mangastream translations are accurate, they're just filled with needless slang and swearing.</br></br>  <br>I Honestly dont see why not. I dont see any part of his character that would show otherwise. Hell it even seems like he dosen't even like the marines and how they do shit. and that he did it to try it out or a favour to someone.</br>    <br> You trying to force it <br> deliberately used words like "could have, probably (x2)" <br> forcing it <br>Yea, you have a good day, asshole.</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>why exactly would Issho care about returning to a base? He can just chill on the boats and whatnot. It's not like he's missing anything, surely someone is already watering his plants for him<br><br>and Saka refusing to see him just gives him more space to fuck shit up as he pleases</br></br></br>  <br>yeah to become a pirate like ace and luffy? ace got a hold of luffy a few months after luffy set sail, why wouldnt Sabo? Heck, why didnt he ask the Revs to take him to Dandan/Luffy/Ace instead of his parents? He had no reason to go sailing with a bunch of strangers when his friends were right there. Why would Sabo even give up his promise/dream to become a pirate to be free in the first place? All that is out of character without the convenient anmesia plotline that allows his character to start fresh and build up his own aspirations. Whether you like it or not, it gives the readers a legitimate reason why Sabo of the Revs chose a different path from his former self. And why he chooses to stick with it despite his memories coming back, since his new ambitions are embedded in him just as much as his pre-amnesia childhood's ambitions.</br>  <br>I know bro but people will always claim it's shit translation to meet their agenda. Just look at </br>  <br> yfw 15 years from now Fujitora, Law and Luffy destroy the marine HQ </br>  <br>Viz non shit Stephen translation.<br><br>I got the idea originally that he was after Luffy and Law but now I'm not too sure. Personally I think he has more shot of making a decent change if he's part of the Navy rather than away from it.<br><br>Was Law even officially taken out of the Warlords during Dressrosa? Would that not have given Law and his crew, which in this case would have included Luffy immunity until the WG said something about it?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ace got a hold of luffy a few months after luffy set sail <br>Pretty sure that was because he herd Blackbeard was hunting Luffy and wanted to check up on him. was a speciffic reason.</br></br>  <br> Heck, why didnt he ask the Revs to take him to Dandan/Luffy/Ace instead of his parents? <br><br>Amnesia. Do you know how it works?</br></br></br>  <br>But Marine HQ is located at the opposing direction of Luffy and Law's goal.</br>  <br> Yea, you have a good day, asshole. <br>*Tips Fedora* Nothing personal KID</br></br>  <br>I think I know at least where devil fruits came from, I've been planning to write up the whole theory once Dressrosa ends but the arc just kept going and going. I'm waiting to see if we can learn more from the dwarves before I type up the full theory, and it's not just speculation there actually are a few clues that not many others have spotted.</br>  <br> lover's spat </br>  <br> why didnt he ask the Revs to take him to Dandan/Luffy/Ace instead of his parents? He had no reason to go sailing with a bunch of strangers when his friends were right there. <br>Same as Ace with Whitebeard stuff. Was on the ship and before he could find a reason to leave he liked it too much</br></br>  <br> Was Law even officially taken out of the Warlords during Dressrosa? <br>nope he and doffy are shichibukai until the next meeting which will obviously happen soon.<br><br> Would that not have given Law and his crew, which in this case would have included Luffy immunity until the WG said something about it? <br>Nope because law outright told fujitora that luffy isn't working for him and that they are an alliance which is why fuji fought law on greenbit.<br><br><br> &gt;implying luffy won't come back to destroy it after reaching raftel </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Go back licking Dellinger's anus.</br>  <br>Teach wasn't hunting Luffy at all. They only met in Mocktown and even then Teach was surprised by Luffy's bounty. It was only after Luffy and Zoro got the Arabasta boost that Teach tried to attack them. Ace had no idea until Banaro.<br><br><br>I think that was his point.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly. That's why I'm saying amnesia is the only way to cover that plothole. I'm arguing with a guy that's saying otherwise.</br>  <br>they're acting like a couple and you know it</br>  <br><br><br>oh. Carry on then</br></br></br>  <br>Well anon, I look forward to hearing it. I like all kinds of theories, and you seem pretty confident in yours.</br>  <br>What? The Revs were literally strangers to him at that point. They suggested to take him back to his parents when he just woke up from his concussion. He could've just said no, take me back to these guys instead.</br>  I feel like a retard for not knowing Benn Beckman was Shanks' First Mate.  <br>Its not called acting like a couple if they're both men you bakayaroga.<br><br>They're just having a bro-down.<br>Bro-ing off with eachother.<br>Just another Bro-out.<br>No homo bromo.<br><br>Watch this video to understand.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gRp<wbr>Tjr4L4T4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br>Tch. Filthy gaijin-sans.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He probably will still be in the Marines. Still be an admiral. Basically arresting law and luffy right then would outrage an already outraged country. A country full of riches. This could cause a lot of problems. Best to arrest them later.</br>  <br>How did you miss that?</br>  <br>Those are pretty shitty couple.</br>  <br>I don't follow SBSs as much as I should.</br>  <br>yes and they'll make up with Brojobs laters</br>  <br><br>It's the best thing he could have done with Sabo honestly. That's not to say Sabo is a good character or a good addition to the story right now, but amnesia is the only way to have made it make sense. Him not going to rescue Ace would be somewhat understandable because respecting his brother and letting him live his own life etc, but there would still be no excuse for him staying hidden away from Ace or Luffy for years.</br></br>  <br>i dunno, I think it's kind of cute<br><br>Sakazuki wouldn't deserve Issho though</br></br></br>  <br> a country full of riches </br>  <br> Sakazuki wouldn't deserve Issho though <br>My thoughts exactly.</br></br>  <br> Kid gets hit by cannon fire <br> Not only that but almost drowns <br> Survives traumatic and painful experience <br> Scar and amnesia <br>Sounds fucking legit to me op. Go back to reading naruto with its moon people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't help but feel that Akainu had a fucking terrible past. In his kid drawing (from when Oda drew a lot of major character as children), he was shown bloodied with a knife in his hand. Makes me wonder if perhaps his home town was destroyed by pirates and his parents were killed or something to condition his blatant and severe hatred for pirates.</br>  <br> &gt;Kid gets hit by cannon fire <br> luffy gets raped by lucci <br> nothing </br></br></br>  <br> Luffy literally cracked the air with one punch <br> cracked the air <br> with ONE punch <br> and it looks like Whitebeard's quake punch literally on WB's level <br><br>Holy shit.<br>SPOILER THAT SHIT.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's Flamingo's spider's web.</br>  <br>That's the spider thread Doffy set up earlier, silly.</br>  <br>That picture is literally irrelevant. What? A couple of buildings got wrecked? You know how many jewels and valuables they have there? First you have king Riku's valuables and all the valuables that doffy took from the people. Then you have the valuables of all the pirates that came there and were turned into toys. All the government agents. Everyone. Doffy was doing blackmarket trades. He had money to do such.</br>  <br>We alreaedy established wether it is logical or not.<br><br>However it does not make for a good story.</br></br></br>  <br>And what exactly makes for a good story?</br>  <br>some fanfictier bullshit that leaves more holes in the plot than a swiss cheese</br>  <br> anime fags <br>I will never understand</br></br>  <br>Well connected plotpoints. Read the thread.</br>  <br><br>Oh.<br><br>Shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Luffy is an angel <br>IT FINALLY ALL MAKES SENSE</br></br>  <br>Chill. I was making a joke.</br>  <br><br>I totally agree, Ace didn't really make an impact on me until he died. And then it was just like...okay so this guy we barely saw got himself and his friends murdered because pride?<br><br>I also find fire a cliched and boring power.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well.... no. Not exactly.</br>  <br>but everything connects with this, what the fuck is your problem?</br>  <br>I thought he's already dead and dreaming all that nonsense.</br>  <br>hurr durr sekrit mission</br>  this was the best part of this entire arc  What is with Sabo being reintroduced anyway? I have no problem with him in the flashback but I don't understand what role he's meant to serve in the story right now.  <br>Come on though. The moves Ace does is pretty damn cool looking.</br>  <br>See </br>  <br>His problem is that there probably was a more interesting/complex way to write the same story, and he's probably correct.<br><br>That said, amnesia did the job well. It just doesn't make for the most interesting version of the story, and I guess I'm okay with that.</br></br></br>  <br>It makes sense logically, yes. But from a narrative standpoint, things are jsut dropped in without any conenction to the other events in the plot.</br>  <br>We'll figure it out in a few years. My guess is he'll save Luffy from some predicament.</br>  <br>Doffy was supplying weapons and shit to countries. His defeat is gonna end a lot of wars, for better or worse. Revolutionaries have an active interest in countries.</br>  <br> hurr durr I forgot everything except that I don't like my parents </br>  <br>Gear 4th for me but this is pretty high up there</br>  <br>I didn't understand Kuma's role in the story during his first appearance beside him being a Shichibukai.</br>  <br>This is how I feel about it. When Oda dies, You go write one piece since you are a plot master. Of course things can always be done better. But it's not your story to tell. Go write your own manga where the plot is up to your standards.</br>  <br> what is subconsciousness </br>  <br>The examples in the thread are not what I mean. I am talking about the discussion.<br><br>The plot of One Piece would need to be restructured drastically for Sabo to smoothly fit in without the amnesia plot device. Oda foreshadowed him for quite a while, and the fact that he didn't manage anything better is a sad thing.</br></br></br>  <br>hurr durr he didn't forget how to talk either</br>  <br><br> hurr my parents were more important than my brothers </br></br>  <br> how pathetic <br>why would he ever say that? was this shitpanda's doing?</br></br>  <br>hurr durr of course they are</br>  <br>probably, they even got the name wrong too</br>  <br>Not the point, not at all.</br>  <br> hurr durr that's not how amnesia works you dumb fuck </br>  <br> a jolly good time with my bros vs traumatising parents who all wanted to burn down the place. </br>  <br>hurr durr that's not how hurr durr work you dumb wank</br>   this thread   <br>you included</br>  Post more Dellinger pic pls.  <br><br> have serious head trauma as a child resulting in amnesia  <br><br>how is this bad writing</br></br></br></br>  <br>There is no way to know the roman writing of a name from the raw alone. Oda confirmed it to be Russian after this was released. They actually put a translator note about it, what else could they have done ?</br>  <br>He felt repelled by the thought of going back to the island because his experiences were etched in his subconsciousness.</br>  <br>This actually makes sense though. His memories of his brothers would have been short term memories compared to his parents whom he knew for many years, so if he actually had amnesia he would remember his parents.</br>  <br>Doesn't "connect to other events in the plot" according to someone.</br>  He never got his wish and wasted his best years on Bulma. <br><br>Being Yamcha truly is suffering.</br></br>  <br>I miss "pat-pat" Goku</br>  <br> Overcomes his fear an gets a gf <br> Bitch tells him he better change his clothes and hair if he wants the relationship to work <br> He does it <br> Any time bitch is around a hot guy she must be remained she has a boyfriend <br>Can anyone blame him for cheating?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why he didin't continued to play Baseball ?

I should have delayed watching it so as to avoid getting overly excited for the rest of the OVAs and S3. It's going to be a great year, for sure.

Hitting in the general direction of the eye is impressive enough in itself.  <br>None because they all have type 89's instead of type 64's.<br><br> Anime using 1980's jap military arsenal. </br></br></br>  <br>Gate doesn't have character with that level of moe and genki at the same time</br>  Will potato/rod of steel girl ever get fanarts or even better doujinshi?  <br>No, even itami's trio get barely any art.<br>Hell Rori only has 1 half decent hentai drawing of her riding itami, rest were shit.</br></br>  <br>They look like an airsoft team more than a military squad.</br>  <br>Who's the whopper junior of Gate?</br>  <br> tfw drawfags are still wasting theif time on Hestia instead of use said time for a superior goddess like Rory. </br>  <br>In their defense, they DID say the scouting squads were given outdated equipment in case it fell into enemy hands.</br>  <br>They use old weapons because<br>1)it's more thsn enough<br>2)less budget<br>3)in case they have to retreat through the gate leaving equipment behind they won't lose anything valuable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They even said that the planes were nearing the end of their service life time when one of them got cooked by the flame dragon.<br><br>The short haired squad 3 girl said that her rifle was surplus clearance shit when it got bent as she blocked a sword strike from the bandits.<br><br>Heck because of the low budget a lot of the other squads weren't even wearing the right camo. Itami's group got the new camo simply because he was the Hero of Ginza and on recon, so they gave him the camo first.<br><br>They were also afraid of damaging their night vision shit, they only got MRAPs after their initial encounter with the fire dragon, probably from the USA throwing some supplies at the JSDF because they explained that the USA already assumes that they'll get a slice of the pie.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they only got MRAPs after their initial encounter with the fire dragon <br>There was no need for them before.<br>Humvees and LAVs are better for reconnaissance if you don't have to deal with mines,IED or bandits with RPGs.</br></br></br>  <br> because they explained that the USA already assumes that they'll get a slice of the pie. <br>On the side of politics, why do people think it's retarded? I don't know why people call it retarded, some anime out there get praised for its politics and it's more retarded than Gate's.</br></br>  <br>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</br>  <br>I like how they mention the MRAPs had A/C.<br><br> Don't worry guys, no need to be afraid of flame dragons now, we got A/C! <br><br><br>Personally I thought it was plausible, those scenes with China would be exactly what China would do if they got hold of the Gate, though their ability to field special forces in Japan is kind of laughable.<br><br>They were spot on about how having USA around is what keeps China and Russia from directly storming for the Gate.<br><br>Perhaps they think that Japan wouldn't send the JSDF over, and then loiter around and ask for peace negotiations the way they are in the manga? Makes them appear to be too much of the good guys?<br><br><br>The manga just can't come out fast enough.<br>It's been so long since I was this excited over a manga,</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> appointing a Rebel and a traitor as a municipal governor <br>What the fuck</br></br>  Any pictures of her sister?<br><br><br>Yes, they produce heat and a radar cross section.<br><br><br>Just add more sabot to the mix.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dragons are confirmed to resemble a stealth fighter on radars</br>  What happened at the end of the VN?  <br> Makes them appear to be too much of the good guys? <br>This is what people have issues with. Like this anime is just Japanese military self-wankery and that semi-realistic premises should always be logical. That the US should have gotten a slice of the Gate pie since all of Japan's neighbors would demand it too. Or that Abe would be called for an inquiry to why they did not ask help since their country was under attack.<br><br>But mostly it's concern out of Japan's "disturbing recent trend of militaristic nationalism" or something along those lines.</br></br></br></br>  <br> VN <br> Leilei open a second Gate after the first one was destroyed and the first thing Itami do is rushing to the comiket, it isn't over yet and it's a LN <br> Also Empress Pina is the girl with the higher chance to win Itami </br></br></br>  <br> Any pictures of her sister? <br>She's hot.</br></br>  What's the difference between the webnovels and the LN?  <br>I would prospect her soil if you know what i mean</br>  <br>The Japanese are pretty split on their military.<br>The US has been pushing them to take a more active role though, both in the past middle east support roles, and the work with the rest of SEA and contain China role.<br><br>Also the build Heli carriers that can be quickly converted to F35 carriers fiasco.<br><br>Personally I'm fine with that, as China's been a big bully throwing it's weight around at the little countries.<br><br>But enough of that, more GATE and less IRL.<br><br>I'm glad that GATE focuses less on politics and more on Itami's random adventures and accen-tion into mythical godhood. <br><br><br>Personally I still think Rori has the biggest chance, Itami likes her personality the most, the elf has the best body, but she keeps calling him daddy, the mage's relation ship with him was more like mentor and student. The Dark Elf is too compliant for his tastes.<br><br>Pina hasn't been that interesting for itami. Itami with his lordship and vast mythical legendary feats is way above Pina, even for a political marriage, she doesn't even bring that much to the table.<br><br>Rori's already dedicated the last 40 years of her demigod hood to following Itami, and her claim for the goddess of love and her blood contract with itami is proof she has the hots for Itami, she spent 900 years without any blood contracts after all.<br><br>I think it was funny during the flame dragon arc when they were bluffing to Hardy's priestess and then JSDF came in and completely wrecked the two dragons, making that priestess believe it was itami's power and adding to itami's mythical legends, as seen by the flood of titles, and gifts once he returned to base.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit, the second point was my apprehension.<br><br>Anything notable about Rory? Will other countries enter the gate like it was considered in the manga?<br><br>Thanks</br></br></br></br></br>  Did they get to onsen scene in the anime ? Man I wish to see that shit animated.  <br> tfw No elf rape scenes <br>The not showed blood. Mr bones anime is more gory than GATE</br></br>  <br>why is <br> on that plane, is she popular?</br></br>  <br>It's been mentioned in the manga, that Japan will consider turning against the world if the fantasy land was worth it.<br><br>For now though, they are just taking it slow and cautiously.<br>They are absolutely against any other country deploying a military into their country though.<br>USA will keep everyone else at bay with a cold war like status quo, as they are assuming that they will get a slice of the pie.<br><br><br>No, the anime is currently just finished with the first flame dragon encounter, and Pina getting sent out.<br><br>Italica siege is next, and then the visit to Japan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  TFW nip peen size being kept as military secrit.<br>Or they rose points in diplomatic negotiations.</br>  <br>  Itami with his lordship and vast mythical legendary feats is way above Pina, even for a political marriage, she doesn't even bring that much to the table. <br>The entire Empire is what she brings to the table. That's quite a bit bigger than a lordship under a king... under the Empire (though King Boss has told the Empire to go fuck itself).<br>Also Pina gets very much into Itami, to the point where Hamilton puts aphrodisiac in a keg of beer when they go on vacation, to insure they fuck.  Turns out, mermaids get their hands on it, and orgy ensues. </br></br></br>  <br> The dissapointment of this girls when they see the Japanese dick </br>  Was there ever any kind of JSDF collaboration or sponsorship for any of the iterations of GATE?<br><br>Other than the obvious fact that the original author was in the JSDF?</br></br>  <br>Yes let's militarize the Pacific I am sure nothing could go wrong.<br><br>I wonder how the US would like it if Chinese aircraft carriers sailed the Gulf of Mexico?</br></br></br>  <br> I wonder how the US would like it if Chinese aircraft carriers sailed the Gulf of Mexico? <br>China isn't the world police.</br></br>  <br> Chinese aircraft carriers <br><br>You mean carrier, as in singular.<br><br>The Chinks only have one.<br><br>Also the Chinks couldn't back up a war against American interests in American waters, while America can easily back up a war against Chinese interests in Chinese waters, so the analogy doesn't really work.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pina is dangerously turning into Risa</br>  <br>It's not even set in stone that she's getting to be the next king, her brother has a bigger running, hell she's 10th in equation.<br><br>She brings no benefits that Itami doesn't already enjoy, itami already have close ties with other kings, mining rights, a mythical lengend, tax exemptions and free travel.<br><br>Pina's into itami, but a bunch of other girls are also into itami, and itami's more into the original trio + dark elf than Pina.<br><br>The people as a whole isn't even that fond of the empire, and view the JSDF in much higher regards. Marrying Pina would bring more harm to the image in the view of the public.<br><br><br>I don't really want to talk about IRL, but every other SEA country except NK and Russia are fed up with China and are beefing up their military recently.<br><br>Technically China has 1 carrier, 3 more under construction, and 1 land based training platform.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why don't the Japs just show a video of an atomic bomb explosion and claim that it is theirs to scare the emperor into sucking their Jap dicks?

Makes them appear to be too much of the good guys? <br>As compared to what? Overthrow the government and turn the whole planet into another Iraq? The manga even outright stated that Japan doesn't want to deal with the problem of crippling the main world power in the Gate world, it leads to mass civil unrest.</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Jtg<wbr>hY3p8luE</wbr>  [ ]  <br>No, more like display overwhelming military might directly to the King and force fast negotiations instead of sitting around and letting the King and other Senates think that they have a chance of retaking Arnus Hill.</br>  <br><br>"Jap Blue" paint jobs make me feel funny inside.<br><br>And they make me wish the US would still do "Army Green" for their fighters.</br></br></br></br>  <br> No, more like display overwhelming military might directly to the King and force fast negotiations instead of sitting around and letting the King and other Senates think that they have a chance of retaking Arnus Hill. <br>That's what the Dragon Head is suppose to do. The point is that the JSDF doesn't have the mandate to overthrow the government and they were using standard negotiations done by the modern world. They are not trying to be "good guys", they just have laws and regulations they folow because they are Japanese and red tape is everywhere. Itami is the crazy main lead who doesn't follow orders properly.</br></br>  <br>The dragon head was more simply to tell the people that the flame dragon is dead.<br>They don't claim responsibility directly and just let rumors build.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I feel the way the JSDF acts is perfectly fine, I just threw out the point because someone asked for another view point.<br><br>All I care about is more Itami and co, and more Rori.<br><br>That and that leader of the bunnies is being a bitch needs some saving.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think there's no point in directly telling the people that they slayed the dragon. That would only mean the people will put themselves under JSDF protection and as mentioned many times by another anon, Japan doesn't want to govern a separate place since the JSDF only specializes in humanitarian efforts and it's a hassle to govern shit.</br>  <br> JSDF only specializes in humanitarian efforts <br>This is one of the main reasons why they're trying to win the local populance by fixing their problems.

As of 2009, approximately 70% of the battalion was female. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is no substitute for muscle mass, you simply can't expect many women can drag around a downed 200lbs+ man with gear along with their own gear in a firefight, it'll just cause more casualties. <br><br>You also can't expect most women to function well given the same equipment load as men, giving them the same load, lowers mobility causing casualties.<br><br>Giving them lower loads results in less equipment, ammo and other supplies resulting in casualties.<br><br>Loading men with more equipment to make up for the equipment deficiency cause by women causes casualties.<br><br>This doesn't even begin to talk about their periods, mood swings and other shit that further drops combat efficiency. Not to mention hygiene problems on the front lines resulting in their cunts getting infected and other shit, it's simply not worth the money, hassle and other factors to deploy women on front line combat roles.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How much female staff sexual favors do you think is going on?</br>  <br><br>So you know how in the Army and Marines, the females are either sluts or bitches?<br><br>In the Air Force, they're ALL sluts</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well I know my buddy was going to strip clubs every Saturday when he was in training at the Air Force but I never heard of him banging his female classmates.</br>  <br>Doesn't change the fact that men had to kill themselves for women because women are incompetent.</br>  <br>There is absolutely no need for giving women frontline/command roles if nation itself is in danger of being destroyed.

He had the perfect shot, fucked it up to check for backblast, and jerked the trigger.<br><br><br>Yeah, after it learned to fear and protect itself.and they never got a headshot in. At that point the dragon was overwhelmed and didn't know what was wat. It's not till his arm blew off that he was like 'Fuck. I gotta bail here'</br></br></br></br>  <br>He did teach them, but they forgot everything when they saw the dragon.</br>  <br><br>Exactly.<br><br>Anyway, you wanted military power level /a/?<br><br>I give you this.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RrS<wbr>S058pjWw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lol</br>  <br> He did teach them <br>correction, he tried to teach them. they were too busy making dick jokes.</br></br>  Why are they not more angry about being spied on?  <br>It's like a fucking child poking their head into the command tent with curiosity. Why would they be angry?</br>  <br>Huh. Japan doesn't have female fighter pilots? Why not? It's actually one of the few 'in the line of fire' jobs that they can do that their physiology doesn't hold them back. They're actually better at it because the shorter you are the better you can handle G-Forces.<br><br>So wow. Japan actually bans women from the one combat role they physically excel at.<br><br>And yes, physically, women are complete shit in a ground infantry role.<br><br>Being a female in the military means lower/easier standards fitness standards, super relaxed dress &amp; appearance standards, not having to worry about being placed in the direct line of fire and easier jobs, a shitload more healthcare (and the like) benefits, and equal pay.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No<br>They either blackblasted each others or the dragon simply killed them because they forgot to remove the secure, the beast dodged all the rockets they managed to fire too.</br></br>  <br>Yeah but your reasons are a tad bit exaggerated don't you think?</br>  <br>Something about being shot down behind enemy lines, and special pilot suits that fit them.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure this guy got a direct hit on it's side.</br>  <br>because people can't into faux-latin</br>  <br>Didn't he fuck up some how tho?</br>  <br>Yeah. They require smaller g-suits and gear. It's a slight annoyance on the flight equipment personnel, but considering how rare female pilots are it doesn't end up being a huge deal.<br><br>I mean, everything any pilot wears is sized and fitted anyways. It's the same amount of work.</br></br></br>  <br>It's just <br> wordius, wordus, wordia. </br></br>  I hate Gate manga because of low res shit scans. Pain to read  <br>Japan would probably use the USA's 'midget sized/female' flight gear anyways considering they're manlets.</br>  <br>He sacrificed himself and shot the dragon as the dragon caught him with the fire breath.<br><br>The backblast retard elf also got a hit in the neck.<br><br>I think the arm blasting off was because it's got less scales there and it was a thin limb, the dragon could take multi hits to it's main body.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Good luck hitting anything.</br></br>  <br>It's slavshit all you do is pull and pray</br>  <br>Oddly enough the requirements for being a fighter pilot are much more extreme than ground infantry.</br>  <br>It doesn't have the hygiene problems that ground infantry has though.</br>  <br>Planes are fucking expensive.</br>  <br>/k/ i know this is you.<br>you're triggering my autism.<br>pls no</br></br></br>  <br>Let alone one sortie's worth of fuel.</br>  <br>I said headshot. And its legs were fairly chunky, and the explosion still had enough force to blast it clear, and not just shred the fuck out of it. And I'm pretty sure that was with a glancing shot. A direct headshot would fuck that dragon's day up hardcore.</br>  <br>Because in infantry if you fuck up you only lose your life. If you fuck up while in a fighter you take an expensive jet with you.</br>  <br><br>I hear you.<br><br>But not only that but women are far better at handling muti-tasking and do not suffer to the extend that men do from "tunnel syndrome" that all men instinctively get the "going in for the kill" mindset.<br><br>But yeah, mostly logistics (is it worth the cost of all the back infrastructure; toilets, female support staff and so forth?) and being shot down (look at the gulf wars, Afgan or Nam'), small arms fire can still rekt hard.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Chaika?

Is Ai Yo going to shit on neo homuhater?  <br>Mods pls.</br>  <br>It is, but it's too much for my taste.<br><br><br>Thanks.</br></br></br></br>  <br> it made no sense from what we could see <br>But that's the point of the picture.<br>You could see it. It's just subtle and not overt.</br></br></br>    Okay, /a/, I did it, I made anime real. Enjoy. <br><br>Doing drugs is fun.</br></br>  <br><br>I've increased the spiritual energy to super high levels, so now anime will soon become real.<br><br>pic related is how I feel right now.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Good thing I can bend reality and make your words untrue.<br><br>Drugs don't accomplish anything more than what meditation could though. Simply existing is enough.<br><br>All actions are equivalent to each other.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> lel guys in so high le EPIC anime is real <br>No matter how many times you make these threads no matter how many witty comments you add to your shitty gifs, you will be ignored and redirected to /jp/.<br><br>It's time to stop being an attention-whoring faggot.</br></br></br></br></br>  DUDE DRUGS LMAO  <br>drugs are bad mkay?</br>   watch new anime <br> high school setting </br>  <br> implying a high school setting isnt another (highly desirable) form of escapism. </br>  <br>Anime in highschool doesn't necessarily have to be bad if it was executed correctly but every single time it's done is to appeal to faggot otakus that want to relive their highschool life as the self-insert MC with the superpowers and the chicks rather than shut-in fuccbois with no real worth and done have nothing but ruin anime as it panders to their shit taste.</br>   watch new anime <br> it's yuri-centric </br>  <br>I hated high school and cringe every time I think back to being an awkward teenage, so no its not an escapism for me.</br>  <br> ...is just a regular high school boy, when suddenly a portal opens above Tokyo and... </br>  You know this show isn't have bad if you imagine that this character has autism.  reading the manga was a mistake<br>now im depresed<br>i just want cute girls doing cute things with megu nee ;_;</br></br>  which girl is gonna score the first non zombie kill  <br> Megu-nee already did. </br>  <br>i just wish there were more chapters out</br>  <br>I was gonna say Kurumi but maybe Rii is going to do it and it'll take her over the edge from broken to shattered.</br>  Raws incoming soon supposedly, who hype for food cart comeback?<br><br> Erina's face when she keeps getting her hopes up for Souma getting expelled and then he survives </br></br>  Tsukuda STILL hasn't shown anyone's dish other than Souma's. Come the fuck on. Doesn't he realize there are people who like the supporting cast? Is Morisaki paid per dish now and WSJ wants to jew out?  <br>I don't self insert.</br>  <br>I think that's the scene where he's telling Yugi he's got 10 years more experience serving customers.<br><br>By the way, it's a good thing Souma could borrow those benches from Tomita too. If he had to buy those, he'd be in the deepest shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Truly immaculate taste</br>  <br> "You're 10 inches too short to be challenging me" </br></blockquote>]
