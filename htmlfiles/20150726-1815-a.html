[ More detail summary for Saekano Vol 8 -- https://magnavalon.wordpress.com/20<wbr>15/07/20/saekano-volume-8-a-new-beg<wbr>inning/<br>Let's start WaifuFag war</br></wbr></wbr>  Megumi a shit.  <br>Really? Any proof to call her 'shit' ?</br>  Eriri a shit.  <br>Well it depends on your perspective who is shit anon-san</br>  <br><br>Eriri is the last boss.</br></br>  <br>Yeah and I hope Boring-chan win when she meet last boss</br>  <br>Do you mean Utaha will crush both of them?</br>  Utaha a shit.  <br><br>Utaha is only a side character now.</br></br>  <br>Character got MC's first kiss, is not side character</br>  <br><br>That was her last act before being doomed to irrelevancy. Read volume 8.</br></br>  Let's do this again. Prove that Megumi is not the best girl. <br><br>Hint:  you can't </br></br>  <br> “…..Yes, it’s alright, Senpai. I will make you forget that woman’s words.” <br> “Sawamura-senpai is the worst… Abandoning Tomoya-senpai like that… She deserves a death penalty.” <br> “A proper punishment is necessary… And so this time, I, Izumi Hashima, shall destroy Eriri Spencer Sawamura… Eri Kashiwagi.” <br> “Nope, everyone who stands in Senpai’s way is my enemy.” <br><br>Based Izumi. REMOVE ERIRI.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  10/10 main heroine    <br>Megumi a shit.</br>  Reminder that Megumi has no romantic feelings for Tomoya. <br>Reminder that the author favors girls who share a past with the MC.</br>  When does the anime stop at ?  <br> Eriri* a shit <br><br>Fix'd for truth.</br></br></br>  <br>Volume 4.</br>  <br> still saying this after everything that has happened in volume 7 and 8 </br>  <br>Izumi a besto.</br>  <br>Reminder Megumi is his attempt to redo Setsuna.</br>  <br><br>They are nothing alike. From what I remember Setsuna was super manipulative.</br></br>  <br><br>Setsuna was a bitch.</br></br>   “…….Sorry Aki-kun, this game is shit after all. Can I give up?” <br><br>my sides</br></br>  <br> Megumi cussing </br>  <br> you will never play galges at your room with a girl who's only wearing a sweater </br>  Utahafags be butthurt.  <br>Maybe she will strike again in Volume 9. Let's see</br>  <br><br>Doubted it as she seems more like Eriri's sidekick now after reading volume 8.</br></br>  <br>Utaha FTW</br>  <br><br>Her role now is more like a mentor. Eriri is different, she's the rival and thus has more relevance. Now that Utaha outright gave up on Tomoya, it's more like a love triangle.</br></br>  They should make a VN from this; not the Vita game with shitty A-1 illustrations, but a real VN with Misaki Kurehito's art.  <br> she will never sleep in your bed </br>  <br>I wonder if Tomoya gets aroused by her smell when he goes to sleep.</br>  <br>Megumi a shit. A SHIT.</br>  <br> Now that Utaha outright gave up on Tomoya <br>when?</br></br>  <br><br>Volume 7. Right after she kisses him, she says that she gives up.</br></br>  <br>Stop spamming already you autistic shit.</br>  <br>That's just a lie</br>  <br>She knows that Megumi will win and it's futile to keep trying.</br>  <br> First post <br> spamming <br>Stay salty.</br></br></br>  <br> post asking people to prove Megumi is not the best girl <br> ignores it <br> just spams "A SHIT" instead <br><br>As I thought. It's impossible to show that she isn't best girl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  Utaha a best<br>Megumi is fine too<br><br>The rest are irrelevant</br></br></br>  <br> ignores it <br>Too bad I'm not that guy you replied to, Megumifag. But if you want my thoughts, Megumi is a boring and dull bitch, with an uninteresting design to match.<br><br><br> Stay salty. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What a coincidence, those are my exact thoughts about Eriri.</br>  <br><br>I would appreciate those thoughts if they weren't completely baseless.</br></br>  <br> Eriri and Tomoya are still chummy and made up pretty quick <br> Not a heated argument where they shout at each other aggressively <br>Doesn't this make the old summary pretty biased?</br></br></br>  <br>Good for you.<br><br><br>Whatever helps you sleep at night.<br><br><br>Wasn't it obvious? Those summaries were written by a Megumifag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Megumi is still best girl by far. It's too bad Utaha has lost most of her importance in the story, I miss her as part of the group. On the upside, that pretty much leaves Megumi as the only real choice for best heroine in the series. Looking forward to the next volume and the possible catfight between Eriri and Megumi.</br>  <br>Funnily enough, the other summary is also written by a Megumifag.</br>  <br><br>The argument was heated enough that they went from texting to shouting in the classroom. Of course they made up quickly, they're childhood friends.</br></br>  <br> Whatever helps you sleep at night. <br><br>So you can't support your assertion that Megumi is boring. Good to know.</br></br></br>  <br>This. And Maruto writing the story.</br>  <br>Eriri making up with everyone. Whoever said before she took a step back in development needs to eat his keyboard.<br><br>She has no chance, but I'm still going to root for Eriri. She and Tomoya are still cute as childhood friends who cares for one another, as seen in their interactions.</br></br></br>  <br> leave the circle <br> still thinks she can decide who joins <br><br>She's still a bitch.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At least Izumi put her in her place.</br>  Tomoya need to change his vision a bit.<br> Every heroine has great story so you can't decide which one is the main one. <br>Then what he need is to make harem end for his game.</br></br>  <br>Too many small mistakes in the summary.</br>   Megumi asked Tomoya about the date event for sub-heroine 3 where the protagonist leaved the sub-heroine to chase another heroine while the sub-heroine only smiled in front of the protagonist but got angry after he was gone; she asked him if it was based on a real experience. Tomoya said he didn’t remember any experience like that, and Megumi said it must be her imagination after keeping silent for a while. She then asked if he had anything in mind about the scene where sub-heroine 1 and 2 argued against the protagonist’s complaint; Tomoya said it was just a coincidence. Megumi compared the protagonist to the first point Tomoya explained earlier (“hate”). Megumi then brought up about sub-heroine 4’s final story where she fell sick and the protagonist decided to go to her side even though he had an important thing to take care of. Megumi pointed out that the protagonist’s choice gave her an uncomfortable feeling (this is a reference of volume 6’s incident). <br><br>May as well give the MC the same name and face as Tomoya at this rate.</br></br>  <br>The new game is called Saekano you know?</br>  <br><br>Games without a clear main heroine just won't sell.</br></br>  <br>Which one?</br>  <br>Over sensitive much? Ex-member who made a successful and good game is concerned with randoms she thought were riajuus joining?</br>  “Ah, talking about Tokyo Line, I remembered! You, what did ‘that thing’ mean!?”<br>“What do you mean by ‘that thing’? If you don’t say it straight out, I won’t understand!”<br>“‘That thing’ is ‘that thing’! See, the one… The one you did with Utaha Kasumigaoka!”<br>“Ah, that was… No, that was, see, ‘that thing’, you know, ‘that thing’!”<br>“If you don’t say it clearly, I won’t get it!”<br>“Putting it like that, it’s actually us who don’t really get it, though…”<br>“Ah…”<br>“Ah…”<br><br>Why can't the japanese just speak clearly? What the fuck is up with "That thing"?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Eriri is just too retarded to make herself clear.</br>  <br><br>Japanese allows you to omit the subject. That, and awkward translation.</br></br>  <br><br>Ex-members don't have a say in the circle. Simple as that.</br></br>  <br>It's none of her concern anymore. She should stick to her own business.</br>  <br> “If you don’t say it clearly, I won’t get it!” <br>This. Most harem MC might be dense, but don't mean girls has no fault.<br> Poor Ichika </br></br></br>  <br>Very awkward translation.</br>  <br><br>Says who? Just because she left doesn't mean she still can't care as a friend or an ex-member. You guys are just trying to say crap for your own convenience. Eriri at least has a point in that non-otakus really shouldn't be joining a Circle seriously.</br></br>  <br><br>The strange part is how he's so dense. How can he forget an event as important as leaving Megumi on a date?</br></br>  <br><br>Megumi was a non-otaku and did fine.</br></br>  <br>Because the only thing he can remember from vol 2 is Utaha sharing a bed with him.</br>  <br>You would have a point if she wasn't combative and entitled. She acts as if she knows it all and everyone should listen to her. But it backfired when the girls turned out to be otaku, she simply couldn't stand being told so badly and ran away.</br>  <br>So was Tomoya, but that's not Eriri's point. Again the summary leaves out the part where Eriri asks Izumi not to drag her friends into this whole mess. And the girls didn't join not because Tomoya was overly excited in his explanations, but because Izumi and him talked too much about how hard being in a doujin circle is.</br>  <br>Eriri was a bit entitled but the one who was combative was Izumi. And she does know it all because of how difficult making the next game will be. Otakus or not, amateurs just won't cut it at this point.</br>  <br>Megumi a Best</br>  Eriri a shit  <br> Eriri was a bit entitled but the one who was combative was Izumi.  <br><br>Of course she would be. An ex-member was trying to interfere with her plans when she had no right to.</br></br></br>  <br>What if the girls didn't mind how hard it would be to make a game and still decided to work in the circle? Either way, it was ultimately Tomoya's choice to make.</br>  <br>Her case is different. She wasn't a creator and was a model for the main heroine. Besides, she was mostly dragged around by Tomoya before she decide to give it a try.<br><br>Also what   said. <br><br>Although I don't see how she was entitled. Eriri was speaking from experience and holds a belief that amateurs or non-otaku shouldn't be join a Circle. Eriri still has a point. In Tomoya's case he was an amateur, but he's a high tier otaku that knows his stuff and that makes him exceptional.<br><br><br>That's a terrible reason and you know it. Look at the way Izumi's character is changing into as noted by other characters. She's going down the yandere path. It is obvious she is being hostile against Eriri for a different reason.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her actual belief is to stop more girls from getting close to Tomoya.</br>  <br>OP's.</br>  <br> Her case is different. She wasn't a creator and was a model for the main heroine. Besides, she was mostly dragged around by Tomoya before she decide to give it a try. <br><br>And she did really well. The girls could do programming or some other thing.</br></br></br>  <br>Izumi interrupted a conversation between Eriri and Tomoya and completely ignored Eriri though. And you guys are wasting a lot of energy arguing about what's meant to show that Eriri could have a normal conversation with strangers around. Poor Maruto.<br><br><br>The only people Tomoya would be looking for are some help writers, but he doesn't want to because of his promise to Utaha. Now he doesn't have to because Iori is in the circle.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't sound like that at all from context. <br><br><br>Non-otaku going through a similar situation a Megumi shouldn't be a common thing though. But since they are otaku, this point is moot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't be helped. The Utahafag is too slow at writing summaries.</br>      <br><br>I didn't know msnkkan was an Utahafag.</br></br>  <br>He says it in one comment.</br>  <br>Eriri a best.</br>  <br>You are  right. </br>  <br>You are  wrong. </br>  <br><br>No wonder his summaries have been slow. Utaha's been losing relevance with each volume.</br></br>  <br>wrong</br>  <br>Maybe he is not native in English, but let'a thanks him for his summary</br>  No michiru in this thread?  <br><br><br><br><br>Mah niggas</br></br></br></br></br>   This thread is still alive <br>Huh. I could had swore it was heading to fall off the board.<br><br><br><br>Well yeah, of course.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Eririfag being a shitposter <br><br>What a surprise.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, it's better than the old summaries. I feel some of the nuances were still lost though. <br><br> “…The part where the heroine sees the protagonist off with a smile as he leaves her for another girl in the middle their date but gets mad as soon as he leaves is original right? It’s not based on an experience right?” <br> “…At the very least, I don’t remember having an experience like that.” <br> “…Ah, it’s fine ~. It’s nothing~. Just my imagination~.” <br> “Katou?” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ignores Megumifags for being worse shitposters past and present <br>What a surprise.</br></br>  <br> not only likes Eriri but also hates Megumi <br><br>Epitome of shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br> calls out an Eririfag <br> b-but muh Megumifags <br><br>Stop being a retard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Best</br>  <br> Only calls out an Eririfag <br> Doesn't do the same for Megumifags <br>Keep being a retard.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't need to because I don't retardedly assume shitposters are fans of X girl until they give themselves away. Again, stop being a retard.</br>  <br>I don't understand. Why do they hate Eriri but not Utaha?</br>  <br><br>Utaha did less wrong than Eriri.</br></br>  <br>Just enjoy the show instead start comparing your waifu</br>  <br>Care to explain?<br><br>Izumi is a bitch to Eriri and Megumi can't even name her.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Utaha told Tomoya that she was leaving directly. Eriri chickened out and used a text message.</br></br>  <br>They are upset at the way Eriri left the circle. Megumi is just depressed because she can't understand the reasons of Eriri's departure, being her best friend and all. Izumi outright dislikes her though.</br>  <br>Yeah and Tomoya is cool with her, that doesn't explain why the other are anal about her and not Utaha.</br>  <br>Who is they? Only Izumi seems to hate Eriri. She just has it out for Eriri because she is her rival. <br><br>Tomoya is a bit upset, but he is still fine with Eriri. It's like he said, give it some time before he can fully take it all down. <br><br><br><br><br>That isn't it. Tomoya doesn't seem upset by the way Eriri told him of her leave. And Izumi's complaint about Eriri is that she "abandoned" Tomoya. Utaha did the same thing, but Izumi simply has it out for Eriri so she doesn't take take care of Utaha.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That isn't it? <br><br>What? Nothing in your post contradicts what I said. Especially for Megumi since she even confronted Eriri about the way she handled her way out of the circle.</br></br></br>  <br> Pretending to be dumb to shitposts made by fans with unbroken history <br> Still pretending shitposts doesn't exist for the other side and shields the side he is on <br>Keep being retarded.</br></br></br>  Who is first girl in this show?  <br>I think you need to re-read my post. You said because of the way she left. I'm saying that isn't it. It's not about the way, but that she did left. Megumi is bothered because Eriri is her friend and for not being able to understand why she left. Megumi isn't a Creator so that's why she doesn't understand. Tomoya seems like he doesn't get it either since he seems himself as someone still trying to be a Creator so he doesn't fully understand why himself.</br>  <br>I'm not pretending or ignoring anything you dumb sack of shit. I'm just calling shit out as I see it, simple as that. If you can't deal with it, then kill yourself.</br>  <br>Irony </br>  <br>Just stop posting.</br>  <br>It's both actually. Megumi questioned Eriri about why she didn't tell Tomoya personally and Eriri explained herself, but when it came to the reasons Eriri just told her that she wouldn't understand. That's the issue left to resolve.</br>  <br> Tomoya doesn't seem upset by the way Eriri told him of her leave <br><br>I dunno, he still has a grudge against Eriri but not against Utaha. I think her way of leaving definitely had something to do with that, though it's more like he didn't like how she planned to cut him off again. If it wasn't for the train scene, Eriri might have avoided him indefinitely.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is her mouth closed with the sound on but her mouth is open with the sound off?</br>  <br>But she told Megumi why she didn't do it personally. I think you're putting it in the wrong context. The issue is that she left, which also is connected to the reason why that bothers Megumi. For Tomoya, he knows why there is a reason (because Creator) and is able to come to an acceptable that made him support Eriri and Utaha for leaving (what he told to them at the train scene). <br><br><br>Let's say perhaps that might be it. But as it stands, it doesn't sound like that is the reason. It could very well be that Eriri is a childhood friend whom he's rather close with, so he expected a bit more when it came to Eriri leaving his side.</br></br></br></br>  <br> But she told Megumi why she didn't do it personally <br>Yeah, I said the same thing in my post. The point is that it was also part of the issue. Now Megumi is bothered because she can't solve the puzzle that Eriri as a creator is in her mind, but it doesn't mean she wasn't bothered by the way she left.</br></br>  <br><br>The way Eriri left is definitely part of the reason Megumi is angry with Eriri. She doesn't like it when friends are dishonest with each other nor does she like it when people hurt Tomoya. What confuses me is why they're having such a hard time Eriri left. It's simple. Eriri wanted to improve as an artist, so she backstabbed her own circle for her own gain.</br></br>  <br>Maybe Megumi is too shocked because her own initial view of Eriri's character was buttfucked so hard by that event.</br>  <br><br>So she doesn't want to admit to being wrong about Eriri's character? That makes sense. She did say that she believed Eriri to be someone who would never betray someone she was close to.</br></br>  <br>My bad. <br><br>So the saying bothered by the way she left refers to the reason Eriri gave to Megumi that lefts chews at her because she can't understand Eriri. <br><br><br>You don't know that for sure yet. It's like not Eriri wanted to hurt Tomoya, you know. And the issue between her and Eriri isn't about dishonesty, but a lack of understanding.<br><br> backstabbed  <br>That is pure misinformation. She didn't threw them under the bus for their enemies' sake for personal gain or something like that. She left as an artist in order to reach greater heights, to improve herself. And she did so after the main completion of the Circle's first game.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's like not Eriri wanted to hurt Tomoya, you know. <br><br>But the fact remains that she did, and she did so knowing that it would hurt him. Megumi isn't as forgiving as she looks. <br><br> And the issue between her and Eriri isn't about dishonesty, but a lack of understanding <br><br>But that's what I don't get. The reason Eriri left is very easy to understand. It benefited her, so she left. And she left just after Tomoya got his hopes up that they would be able to create another game together.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Who objectively has the best chance at winning?  <br>Megumi. The other girls don't even come close to her.</br>  <br> Megumi isn't as forgiving as she looks.  <br>I guess. Her character is developing towards "that" side a bit.<br><br>I think Megumi can't wrap her head around it because she isn't trying to understand as a creator, but as a friend. That makes sense seeing as how she misses Eriri quite a lot.<br><br><br>It's not secret that Megumi is the main girl. Her end is inevitable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ironically, the reason why Eriri leaved the circle is to fulfill his promise with Tomoya to become his #1 after last year's Summer Comiket.  <br>Eriri would've hurt Tomoya whether she stayed or not. She chose what she thought was the best for both of them. What Megumi can't get over is how Eriri could leave Tomoya.</br>  <br>I hope Tomoya will realize that later.</br>  <br><br>As far as Tomoya's concerned, she had already fulfilled that promise, which was what led to her slump.</br></br>  Why did Utaha get so pissed and hurt when Aki didn't want to read the provisional end of the LN she was writing?  <br> explaining basic storytelling elements </br>  <br>But wasn't she already his number one by volume 6?</br>  <br><br>It wouldn't have as hurt as bad. Who knows, they might've found some way to get her out of her slump together.</br></br>  <br>I reckon it would have been worse actually.</br>  <br>It was more symbolic than anything. By asking him to read it early she was essentially confessing to him and saying that his opinion and approval meant more to her than anyone else's and he flat out rejected her.</br>  <br><br>Eriri doesn't seem so secure now that Izumi joined his circle; that insecurity is her source of motivation, though, so it's good for her in a way,</br></br>  Who's going to be the most annoying kid born from Darling and the girls?<br><br> Little spiders <br> Little sneks <br> Mermaids <br> Slimes can have kids (?) <br> Horse  <br> Harpies  <br> Dullahan can't have kids? <br><br>As always the playlist.<br>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?li<wbr>st=PLaWNUYckT3OPH6k_Ow2FB1CwijLzU3b<wbr>7p<br><br>For the casual faggots or the people who doesn't read the last chapter of the manga   go to prettyanonymus and download the chapter  </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Little spiders since there will be millions of them  head waifu &gt; mlp waifu  <br>Either spider kids or centaur kids.

Or is that just brutally honest?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think an ending where we somehow get 7 darlings would be great because everybody is happy and it's a neat callback to the original strips with the twins</br>  <br>While Miia seems most likely, I would prefer it were Suu. She is by far the most helpful around the house and is easily the most likely to lend a helping hand that actually helps rather than hinders. It's not likely but it would be nice.</br>  <br>I guess you can't really call them daughters actually, the man had nothing to do with it. Two thoughts here: her clone has the same knowledges and experiences as her, or it doesn't and has to learn like a child.</br>  <br>Would she be all shy and bashful and quick to retreat into her shell?</br>  <br>Paladin fags are the worst<br><br>they want to tie you down to some shitty human who probably doesn't even love you</br></br></br>  <br> Go Shadow Knights </br>  <br>maybe end it with a branching what if story where it shows the endings for all girls</br>  <br> YFW Monster Girls were the true wives meant for men <br> YFW "Human women" are just corrupted monster girls who have lost all feature <br>I WAS SO CLOSE TO THE TRUTH BEFORE THEY GOT M</br></br></br>  <br>Thing with Suu is.<br>I can clearly see that she would reject being Darling's wife cause she realizes that others would be hurt if he'd choose her over them even if they wouldn't want to admit they are.</br></br>  <br>Remember, all my dear MonMusu-bros:<br> Be excellent to each other. </br></br>   Darling's in the bathroom <br> suddenly, the roof caves in <br> twister mat on the floor <br> Cerea, Tio, Miaa, Papi and Polt all on the floor <br> Suu in the room above <br> spins the spinner <br> "Right hand yellow?" </br></br></br></br></br></br>   Papi's mom   <br>All of them except maybe sealand.</br>  <br>Of course.</br>  <br>I could see this.</br>  Newfag here. Where's the best place to start read? Batoto only had the last few chapters.  <br>This logic supports giving everything to the girls, and supporting selfish behavior patterns. While I want all the girls to be happy, and this would fulfill that, it would not fulfill it in a satisfying way.<br><br>The harem end is the only end where the girls actually develop. Kurusu doesn't have to have a magical cloning mishap/shenanigans to please all the girls. He's already making them all feel like family. All a 'lel clone end' would accomplish would be a quiet acceptance of the waifufags that want to pretend like all the other girls don't exist and they can headcanon 'Darling x ??? OTP' bullshit like MALtards and Gaiafags.</br></br></br>  <br>Suu wants everyone to be happy after all, rather than prioritizing her own desires above those of others.</br>  <br>*start reading. hit post before finishing.</br>  <br> Where's the best place to start read? <br>From chapter 1.</br></br>  <br><br> you'll never have a family with Rachnee <br><br>this fucking hurts ;_;</br></br></br></br>  <br> The harem end is the only end where the girls actually develop </br>  <br>I'd smack you, but I don't want to mess up those dubs.</br>  Suu and Papi are there for fun, Centorea is a horse and Mero wants to lose. Rachnera and Miia are the only girls who could win  <br> Centorea is a horse  <br><br>and Miia and Rach are just a spider and snake ...the top two would be Miia or Centorea those two would prob feel the most rejected</br></br></br>  <br> Suu wearing a bra <br>What blasphemy is this?We sholud have the head of whoever made this.</br></br>   Smith drops a new girl on Darling <br> It's a chimp in a dress. </br>  <br> and Miia and Rach are just a spider and snake <br><br>Horse vagina, darling is a nice dude but I don't think he's into bestiality</br></br></br>  <br>*should</br>  <br>It's true. Instead of being standoffish and pushing the other girls out of there lives, the harem end would actually let them grow closer to each other, thus becoming a true family unit.</br>  <br>Its prob going to end with something happening to Miia and making darling realize shes the one and the other girls coming to terms with it</br>    The girls are way too selfish with darling for a harem end. Fuck. Even Centorea is okay with stealing him    <br>please go read the OP again</br>  <br>Swell... just like every other harem-turned-nonharem ever.<br><br>I'm sure the majority of the fans will just love an ending like that.</br></br></br>  <br>Huh.Now I'm interested in a Monkeygirl.<br> When she's mad she literally goes apeshit. </br></br>  <br>I'm in top 50 for horse pussy. Top 300ish overall.</br>  <br> those hips <br> those scales going up the sides <br><br>Miia really is best</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ya, i remember i was only a bit behind you before, but i went on vacation and just blind picked answers from my phone <br><br>it sent me super behind</br></br></br>  <br> UKEE UKEE! <br> The fuck are you saying <br> brown gunk hits the wall <br> NO <br> wrecks the place </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What game is this anyway ? <br><br><br><br>better than an open ending</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Monster Girl based on Candlejack wh</br>  <br>Her face and hip scales are moe</br>  <br> bestiality <br>I don't think that word means what you think it means.</br></br>  I think cerea is the best but I've loved lamias since I first play breath of fire 20 years ago. Also I'm not fond of horse pussy.  Cerea can't win cause she has a horse vagina. Sorry  Everyone, shh, the Yetchi is examining the fish.  <br>Comparing 'Utter shit' to 'garbage' and saying it's 'good' is a logical fallacy. I'm on this ride because this is one of the very few harem's I've seen where a real harem end seems likely. I'd rather hold out hope for glory than be contented with mediocre rationalizations like "Well at least 'Utter Shit' didn't happen. At least I got some decent garbage out of this deal."<br><br>A part of me thinks the majority of people supporting the 'one girl' ending are overzealous Snekfags, but I know that selfish people come in a variety of flavors. I'll just never understand why some people would willingly settle for less.</br></br></br>  <br>What would the other girls answer?</br>  Best girl is sleeping  Jesus fuck, TL when?  <br>Why does that have the shitty tumblr gif filter on it?</br>  <br>Fatty</br>  <br>Actually, the ones directly related to the show are the easiest as well as the hardest. You either get 20, or you get 0. It's the more hypothetical ones that require careful planning. Of course I could always get a fourth account for all for answers, but I enjoy challenging myself to pick the right one even if I have three accounts to pick from.</br>  <br>Trans is out, anon.</br>  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/836254/d2d21d<wbr>0f1b/</wbr></br>  <br>Now<br>http://exhentai.org/g/836254/d2d21d<wbr>0f1b/</wbr></br></br>  <br> monmusu.tv/family </br>  <br><br><br>I keeping hoping for a happy end...</br></br></br>  What is the highest point reward on that question game?

Especially the french kissing is so fucking rare outside of hentai.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It really was lewd.<br><br>But fuck. I already busted my nut to the Prisma OVA as well as the Herz episode and then this episode comes in to wreck my shit.</br></br></br>  <br>You obviously missed latest Iliya hype.</br>  <br>its really well done imo, gives the show a new direction and a lack of predicatability. i thought she was pretty boring before she became a yandere.</br>  Would you a Sophia?  <br>Obviously not.</br>  <br> i thought she was pretty boring before she became a yandere <br>It's like you didn't even watch the ED.</br></br>  <br>you know she is a slut deep down.<br>like mother like daughter<br>no exceptions</br></br></br>  <br><br>Prisma Illya wasn't lewd.

Never go into a internet thread for a specific anime that you are watching if you want to avoid spoilers. It doesn't matter how many people do the "right thing" by using warnings, special script to highlight spoiler text, etc. That's one of the goddamn rules of the internet for fucks sake. <br><br> loving the people that are actually dropping this and shows like Gangsta because of the spoilers.  <br><br>Fucking retards.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Welcome to /a/ newfriend!</br>  <br> 4u </br>  <br>Fuck /tv/, baneposting broke me.</br>  <br> want to discuss the anime <br> get spoiled by queers <br> get called retard <br><br>No wonder the thread is fucking dead.<br>Everyone is avoiding cancer like you</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>UU<br>UU</br></br>  <br> discuss an adaptation on /a/ <br> complaints about spoiler <br>Fucking retards.</br></br></br>  <br>Wow, the buttmad is palpable.

If next episode is like this then I might drop it.</br>  <br> yesterday got spoiled into Adlet liking Fremmy in the novel <br> was happy since I like her more than lying rabbit <br> today this </br></br></br>  <br>Actually this scene was recap of episode 3.<br><br>And Passione is tiny studio, can't be helped.<br>http://passione-anime.com/profile</br></br></br></br>  You sure are.  <br><br>If there were threads for this shit before the anime I could agree with you. But that guy is right. People just blatantly spoiled everything to get their cheap lulz.</br></br>  <br>is 25 the staff?<br>Me no knowing nihongow</br></br>  <br>Yeah, that was just the first example I had.</br>  <br>There's been a lot of bullshit spoilers too. Can't trust everything you read here.</br>  <br>So like every adaptation? Fuck off to wherever you came from</br>  <br>25 employees, and that's including freelancer.</br>  Yeah my votes going to Mora Chest, She seems shady as fuck as the fake or Goldof.  <br>Shut up.</br>  Holy shit, dat ED.  Why don't they just fucking draw it properly and finish it before it airs  <br>Too busy with drawing the backgrounds.</br>  <br>Shut up</br>  Whos Moras husband?  <br>Some dude.</br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/efpdvhhchf.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  <br> I am. </br>  <br>I thought it was Goldolf before this cuck stuff began</br>   They got rid of the horses so they wouldn't have to animate them anymore <br><br>I'm dying here</br></br>  <br>They just following the LN.</br>   Whole new ED in episode 4 <br><br>For what purpose?</br></br>   Yeah, she killed some heroes or whatever but she's cool now right   <br>Really.</br>  <br>It's not unusual for a show to change the ED mid season.<br> By ep 8 there're going to announce that they run out of money. </br></br>  It's clear who the true traitor is.<br><br> Everyone. </br></br>  <br> Hans is an assassin that kills people for money <br><br>Who cares? Their only goal is killing the Majin regardless of their past.</br></br></br>  <br>so that they can sell them CDs.<br><br><br>are you mentally challenged? It isn't a smart idea to kill one of the few people able to fight the demon lord no matter what they did in the past. Hans was an assassin and killed for money, do you also want them to kill him ?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I had to contain myself from closing the player and deleting this episode. That's too much retardation and naivety at the same time, dear God.</br></br>  <br>There's nothing naive about. They must kill the demon lord at all costs. If a hero was a goat fucker child killer that sells drugs they'd still have to work together.</br>  <br>Her having a mark is proof enough that she has a desire to kill the demon lord, maybe she deserves to be punished for what she has done, but this is hardly the time for that. If it helps you feel better, she is the first person they suspect as the 7th.</br>  my dick  <br>Half of those things aren't even that bad.</br>  <br>True, even I casually rape goats and murder kids. It's really not that frowned upon any more.</br>  <br>Woah no one said anything about rape, I only have consensual sex with goats.</br>  Only the six with the mark can enter the devil's little peninsula, right?<br>The fake one will be uncovered soon enough.<br><br>Anyway, Flemy is cute.</br></br></br>  <br> The fake one will be uncovered soon enough. <br>You wish.</br></br>  Why does that guy even protects Flamie like that, she's a terrible party member with awful DPS.  <br>HIS DICK</br>  <br>goldof is the fake one, he just wants to protect/rape muh hime</br>  <br>The range bonus though is worth it.</br>  <br>His schlonger and ego told him to.<br>He is the World's Strongest Man™ after all.</br></br>  <br>Can World's Strongest Man beat Madara ?</br>  <br>Mind cucked into wanting to. I'm not joking.</br>  <br>Flamie is adlets "dead" sister</br>  <br>Having a sniper can't be a bad thing.</br>  The sluttiest  <br>The mark is what keeps them alive, none of the marks are fake.<br><br>She's AoE and she shits bombs.</br></br></br>  Fremy best girl  <br>Fremy killed his sister.</br>  <br><br>If only her crit modifier was higher, otherwise I don't see the point, really</br></br>  <br>Which Madara?</br>   Flamie <br>You're kidding me right?</br>  So, is the saint of swamps a loli or a shota?<br><br>I dont trust japan at all with these things</br></br>  <br> So, is the saint of swamps a loli or a shota? <br><br>Does it matter?</br></br></br>  <br>look at this whore, acting like she doesn't know the truth <br><br> and the oscar goes too </br></br></br>  <br>She had to sacrifice the crit bonus from armor for speed and dodge, ultimate kitting strats.</br>  <br>Shota and also the seventh flower.</br>  <br>It's a grill.</br>  <br><br><br>It matters because a shota having the brave mark on his thigh and dressing like a girl would easily be one of the gayest things this season.</br></br></br>  http://hello.2ch.net/test/read.cgi/<wbr>magazin/1437710029/<br><br>Volume 6 in 2ch.<br><br>So many delicous spoiler aka Fremy's suffering.</br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>Only girls can be saint.</br>  <br> ultimate kitting strats <br>wut</br></br>  <br>you want an even higher crit mod? Her crits already do 2x the normal crit dmg</br>   people not realizing that by posting tons of fake spoilers you counteract the real spoilers and thus can continue enjoying the show <br><br>You should be thankful. Also the demon god is Adlet from the future.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Then why did she reply to adlet's "Strongest man of the world"? Is CR making things confusing?</br>  <br> no images <br><br>What is this? 2000 AD? Ooga Booga moonrock.</br></br></br>  <br> Not liking trap shota <br><br>Are you a faggot?</br></br></br>  <br>You haven't watched Ranpo Kitan, have you?</br>   Bunny centered ED <br>YES</br>  <br>man as in human.</br>  <br><br>Is there a way to increase her dps then? as it is, it seems she has a GCD of at least 2 secs before attacking again</br></br>  So what fucking ability did adlet get from being a brave or do you not get any? I feel the show didn't explain it that well.  <br>The ability to brag about being the strongest man in the world at least three times per episode</br>  <br>Doesn't he specifically use the word "otoko" for males?</br>  <br>He gets nothing outside of the ability to survive in kyoumaland, same for everyone else.</br>   ED features Bunny <br><br>Best traitor.</br></br>   I am the strongest man in the world <br> Hey, did you know, I am the strongest man in the world <br> Just in case you forgot, I am the strongest man in the world <br> you are very strong but I am the strongest man in the world <br> LOOK AT ME, LOOK AT THE STRONGEST MAN IN THE WORLD!!! <br><br>Getting real tired of this bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>iie senpai, I'M THE STRONGEST MAN IN THE WORLD</br>  Can anyone go into more detail about fremy and adlet in vol 6?  <br>I can't tell if that is a girl or not.</br>  <br>He does use otoko, but he clearly means that he is the strongest human. Who happens to be male. Remember how he claimed he was stronger than bunny in the first episode?</br>  <br>He does.</br>  <br><br><br>Does the source have something with its gender so we can put this mystery to rest?</br></br></br>  <br>No because all there are shadey spoilers from 2ch and nips can't into proper spoilers.</br>  <br>Use GT <br><br>Spoilers are very easy to understand</br></br></br>    <br> But  it's  true. </br>  <br>Chamo is a woman, there is no ambiguity about that.</br>  <br>There's no mystery. Chamo is a girl.</br>  <br>I need proof anon</br>  <br> Trusting spoilers when everybody is posting fake spoilers. </br>  <br>All saints are woman. Chamo is a saint.</br>  <br>But it also says there's only 6 braves and they showed 7 this episode.<br><br>The show is telling you to not trust everything without proof</br></br></br>  <br>True. I've read all the way up to volume seven and Chamo's gender is still ambiguous.</br>  <br> The show is telling you to not trust everything without proof <br>BOKU WA SHOCK</br></br>  <br><br><br>Meant anything but you guys still get the message, I dont trust japan and their obsession with shoving traps into everything.</br></br></br>  <br>i literally guessed it the first episode having seen none of the source material. <br><br>also, youre complaining about spoilers when you chose to converse with people online who had read the source material, and expected not to be spoiled on anything involving the show. <br><br>all of this leads me to believe you might be mildly retarded.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chamo is a chick, get it through your retarded skull already, you goddamned autistic manchild.</br>  <br>Or just new to interacting with people outside of his home.</br>  <br>Just wait til you pull down his pants and find a surprise package</br>   "There is an enemy among us" <br> immediately fades to new ED with Bunny right in your face </br>  What is with the way the characters are drawn in some scenes.<br>At one point I thought I was watching this in 480p.</br>  <br>Whats retarded is that people on /a/ post spoilers and beg for spoilers in literally every LN thread so you cant have a real discussion in any thread without getting spoiled to hell on everything.<br><br>So of course, the only people left are people that read the source, retards that want to be spoonfed spoilers and the rare person looking for discussion that is quickly discouraged from visiting the threads from all the spoilers.</br></br></br>  <br>The fucking manga is marketing her as a girl, you bloody wanker.</br>  What the fuck is happening in this thread?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128584909 <br>fuck off</br>  <br>Same as all the traps<br>Draw a girl, call it a guy and market is as a girl so people can delude themselves into thinking its not gay</br></br>  <br>New accell.</br>   activator for the barrier is a sword <br> is magically removed <br> everyone blames adlet <br> not blaming the one that can control swords <br><br>what the fuck</br></br></br></br></br>  You can't really blame people for being skeptical on Chamot's gender. Especially with Gatchaman's latest episode and all.  Well, they kind of increased the pace of the novel and skipped almost a chapter.<br><br> inb4 they rush to hans/adlet fight next ep </br></br>  <br>And all the other traps and reverse traps this season.</br>  <br>No they didn't, you misread something?</br>  <br>They need to say the words with their other hand on the pedestal as well.</br>  <br>The pedestal bunny chopped up already?</br>  <br><br><br>All reddit tier responses.</br></br></br>  <br>Just like normies download TV series too</br>    <br>He's  moe .</br>  <br>That's harsh, anon. Poor girl was just having a completely reasonable freakout.</br>   103 unique posters <br>we alive again?</br>  <br><br> 103 unique posters <br> 70 of them posting fat nazis </br></br></br>  <br>Jesus. When he finally snaps there won't be anything left of that bunny pussy.</br>  <br>All that retard strength.</br>   bunny ED <br>I'm so okay with this. I wonder If each Brave is gonna get his own ending.</br>  <br> lelouch <br> going for the tit monster yet again <br><br>I aint even surprised anymore</br></br></br></br>   QUALITY ED <br>Why?</br>  <br>Nope, only Adlet, fremy and cuntwhore</br>      <br>they do the same shit on every episode, spend all the budget on 2 minutes, everything else is full of QUALITY and good backgrounds.</br>  <br><br>Oh tee pee.</br></br>  <br>This season is pretty good.</br>  <br> fake bunny ears <br>Gee, I wonder who's the fake.</br></br>  Aren't they locked on the wrong side of barrier? The dialog from previous episode made it seem like person activating the barrier will not be able to enter demon peninsula and now all heroes are gathered right beside the seal.  <br> Goldof is so huge his head will be cropped out in every group shot. <br>Poor thing.</br></br>  <br>He's saying she's the traitor, no?</br>  <br>Yep, they're right outside the blasted hellhole.</br>  <br>Yeah, that's why they're freaking out.</br>  <br>Exactly. They're all inside so no one can go kill the Demon God.</br>  <br>I dont know, i just assumed at this point. Guess rereading what he said, hes retarded but not far off.</br>  does this Chamo gril eats anyone of the current six?  <br>I want to literally suck the fart out of her butt<br>while squeezing her butt cheeks apart</br></br>  <br> 7th <br> Not the   8th huh? <br><br>Interesting ideas fermenting in here.</br></br></br></br>  Whoever is the traitor their body must be ripped in half for punishment.<br><br>I won't settle for anything less.</br></br>  What's up with the QUALITY, i can barely watch without laughing.  <br>It's too late for someone else to get chosen now that it has already happened. Trying to kill her now could result in a drastic reduction of their fighting power, considering only six heroes can go into the demon territory. Also the whole choosing ceremony thing is supposed to be fool proof. You have to desperately want to kill the Majin in order to get a crest, and a god confirms the fact, so that's supposed to be proof enough of loyalty to the mission.</br>  Bunny bitch is just pretending to be retarded isn't she?  <br>Yes.</br>   She is an assassin <br> Are you an assassin? <br> Yes <br> Welp, she is with us now <br><br>Seriously? Doesn't matter how best girl she is, that made no sense. She admits she killed other potential braves but they just ignore it?<br><br>I mean, is not as if the braves tried to kill her or something, she openly said she killed them for selfish purposes</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  bunny doesn't deserve the hate  This episode brought forth tears. The sad kind.<br><br>Goddamn, good thing the characters and mystery have me hooked, I'd rather not drop this.</br></br>  <br>Someone that cute can't be evil.</br>  OP of the season?  <br>See </br>  <br>It doesn't fucking matter, if she's a real brave she's a real brave and those other saints were worthless pussies anyways.</br>  <br>And?</br>  <br>It makes sense. You can't be chosen as a Hero if you don't have the will to kill the Majin, and she said to Adlet at the beginning that she wanted to fight by herself. She was an enemy but things changed, now she's an ally, you don't know her past.</br>  <br>Maybe I'm forgetting the translations here, but all Saints are women for whatever reason.<br><br>Dudes have to just get lucky with genetics, like Goldoff, luck into bizarre fighting techniques, like Hans, or train for stupidly long times in very specific things like Adlet and... probably most of the other potential heroes they mention throughout the series.</br></br></br>  <br>There are 20 like it every season.</br>  <br>The fuck is wrong with you</br>   4th episode. <br> New ED <br>But i liked the previous one.</br></br>  <br>It was ugly as fuck.</br>  <br>Those character song CD's aren't going to sell themselves.<br>On the plus side, we will get an ending sang by Aoi Yuuki.</br></br>    <br>Mugino pls.</br>  <br>Ten seconds into a bad situation and she loses her mind. These fuckers may be strong at fighting but no one among them has half a brain.</br>  <br>A lot less goofy in the LN.</br>  <br>She's faking it.</br>  <br>Nigga that scene was more than enough proof that she is up to no good.</br>  <br>just like your girlfriend during sex</br>  <br><br><br>From the point of view of some party members is better that than being shot in the back.<br><br>Both choices makes perfect sense since both are valid points of views. <br><br>What makes no sense is the fact Adler would take her side in case of conflict as if she was a defenless innocent gril who did nothing wrong.<br><br>I mean if you have to choose a side why would you take the side of a confess assassin?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They don't know that.</br>  <br>Read the fucking LN and stop bitching.</br>  <br>If it was a qt yeah.</br>   Maybe if we zoom in no one will notice.   <br>Because killing a hero would be stupid. She has the crest so she's no going to backstab them. It's that simple, they are all very strong too, they can't get killed by surprise like that.</br>  Best.  <br>? notice what?</br>  <br>And then there is this jarring cut.</br>  <br>Both are on the same side, as they are both heroes. She confessed since she has nothing to hide. He never thought she did nothing wrong, he takes her side because what she did in the past is not important when their goal is to kill the fucking Majin. Many of the heroes are not ''saints'', they have some dark pasts.</br>  <br>How terrible it looks?</br>  Whoever directed this episode decided that they wanted to the camera to move a lot. So much spinning, panning, and zooming.  Why are they just zooming in like this? It's very off putting.  <br>It's blurry as fuck because they zoomed it.</br>  <br>Oh that. Yea I kinda got so used to it I dont even notice it anymore at this point</br>  Guys spoil me:<br><br>Is this guy really the strongest man in the world?</br></br>  <br>No actually  Adlet is the demon god from the past </br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Does that look like the face of a liar anon?</br>   So is Bunny responsible for the lockout?   <br>Bunny is responsible for everything  even your moms eventual death </br>  The size of Fremy's boob-strap varies from scene to scene.  <br>Heh, those guys sure love Moura.</br>  It took four episodes to build the slightest iota of tension. Fuck this show.  <br> Fucking bunnies </br>  <br> they'll never know </br>   Severely injured Adlet trading blows with Hans <br><br> Mora wasn't able to touch Hans until plot demanded he lose <br><br>Seriously though, Adlet is stronger than people give him credit for. With sufficient planning and having access to his trunk I'd bet he'd be able to take most of the hero's 1v1.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So he really is the strongest man in the world.</br>  Enjoy a dose of budget-induced motion sickness aka budget sickness.  <br>They take their time for a faithful adaption faggot, usually other adaptions complete a volume with 4 episodes.<br><br><br>Yes he is, he could have killed Hans this volume but he didn't.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He is Aztec Batman.<br><br>My stomach hurts.</br></br></br>  <br>He is the strongest anon, only in terms of stats is he considered the weakest.</br>  This show is hard enough to watch with the terrible CG and writing. At least try and pull yourselves together Passione.  <br>Completely kill the Majin? How can Fremy do that?</br>  <br>   Adlet lost his love for Fremy. <br>Why.</br></br>  So people are bitching about others asking for spoilers, mind giving a place to read the LN please?  <br>Who is Fig?</br>  <br> oh man oh god OH MAN OH GOD </br>  <br><br><br> “What’s the matter Hans? Scared?”<br><br>“Yeah I’m scared. There’s no point in deceiving you.”<br><br>“You’re honest.”<br><br>“I kill people, but I don’t lie. I can’t lie.”<br><br>Given the situation, there would be no success in defeating Hans. Success for Adlet would be clearing up his false charge and finding out who the seventh was. So what he was trying to do now was his plan to achieve that goal.<br><br>“Meow,” Hans was observing Adlet carefully. He was checking whether there was something concealed in Adlet’s clothes or mouth. Or whether or not there was something that had fallen nearby which could be used as a weapon.<br><br>But Hans wasn’t paying attention to the sole weapon Adlet was holding, his sword. And using that chance, Adlet struck.<br><br>Adlet gripped the hilt of his sword tightly and twisted it. And with the sound of a heavy spring, the blade of Adlet’s sword flew, shooting out in a straight line and knocking off the scabbard at Hans’ waist.<br><br>“Meow!” Hans jumped back and immediately after Adlet shouted to him.<br><br>“Hans! Someone like you can understand what just happened right? I purposefully missed with that attack.” As Adlet shouted, he threw his remaining scabbard far away into the distance. He was now completely unarmed.<br><br>“…Why did you miss?”<br><br>“A guy like you should understand that too.”<br><br>After throwing away the hilt of his sword, Adlet proceeded to remove his armor and his clothes, showing Hans that he was truly weaponless.<br><br>“Think Hans. If I were the seventh then what reason would I have to miss with that attack? That last attack was the only chance I had to be able to kill you. What reason would there be for letting that chance slip before one’s eyes?”</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> <br><br>BASED ADLET THE WORLD'S STRONGEST</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Trying to kill her could result in her killing or crippling one of them. Their ultimate objective is to preserve their strength and venture further into the peninsula until they can re-seal or kill the Majin.<br><br>She has the mark, which means that she fully and truly wants to complete the mission as does everyone else. You're looking at a group composed of people who are probably from rival, competing nations, most of whom have killed other people in the past.<br><br> Plus Hans is also an assassin, who was killing people just for cash as opposed to an ideal. Even after he got his crest, he demanded to be paid before he went off to deal with the Majin. </br></br></br></br></br>  inb4 <br> madlet ayyer is fake hero that must defeat the other 6 and go to the demon king to accept his glorious overlords dick in his ass </br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br><br>Jesus H.

First volume had five chapters and an epilogue. That means the entire season will be a single book, meaning it ends on that dumb cliffhanger that might never get resolved due to its reception.<br><br>If we're talking about using an anime to grow a market, then this isn't doing great.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She has fiend blood. </br>  This show just reminds me of tales of.  <br>This should look good with SVP, just use it.</br>  <br>Its to sell the books, nothing else. The anime is a 20min commercial.</br>  <br> REPLICAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA </br>  1080p QUALITY  <br>This is fake right?</br>  <br> Should be... his sister was killed by the townsfolk who went mad with the revelation of... whatever it was Tgurneu told the village. It was part of his condition for sparing them, that they do it themselves. <br><br>The guy seems like an honest sort of manipulative monster, so I'm inclined to believe him.<br><br>No idea about the second sentence though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it's a four hour and twenty minute long commercial, and they already spent about a third of that establishing the hook.<br><br>Maybe you could call it a bait and switch, where the switch is more interesting than the initial bait. But we were already promised paranoia by the series, and it's taken a long time to get there. The novel did it better, by starting with a prologue red herring on who the 7th is and setting the tone for how the story would develop.<br><br>Most people have the "three episode" rule for new series, you know?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It seems true. I'd like to know about Fremy's side of things though.</br>  <br>Because Adlet resembles long-hair Luke?<br>Because of the typical JRPG party but with a tweest?<br>Because there are traitors everywhere?</br></br></br>  <br>Then? What makes her special? She would still be curbstomped by Cargikk before reaching the majin.</br>  <br>I do think they got to it alot later than expected considering it's a part of the synopsis which is a shame considering it would have made a great ep 3 hook for people.</br>  <br>All of the above plus more.</br>  SHAFT<br>H<br>A QUALITY<br>F<br>T</br></br></br></br>  never trust a bunny, name an anime bunny that hasn't lied, you can't.  I kept telling myself I would watch this on a good occasion since it looked good. I haven't had a good occasion .  <br>Me</br>  Goldov is supposed to be 16 or something right? Do they have insane amounts of growth hormone and roids there?  <br>Good genes, it seems.<br><br>The setting doesn't seem to have like... "super human breeding" or anything so... yeah. Good genes.</br></br></br>  <br>No, the kid is abnormal.</br>  <br>I just noticed, the flying parchment has all the instructions regarding barrier activation right?</br>  <br>the same happened to me but after watching the OP I kinda got in the mood, It might help you.</br>  <br>And that's really all I'm saying.<br><br>I only started watching this series because the synopsis was intriguing, and it turned out One Punch Man was further away than I thought. I really only have room for two short run series at a time in my schedule, so this got picked up instead of the new Saint Seiya series.</br></br></br>  <br> Bunny fucked her dog kyoma <br>wat</br></br>  <br>Heh, they are all calling Hans OP as fuck gary stu</br>  <br><br>Just start it.</br></br>  <br>Ehh... he's the best balance between brains and brawn in the group.<br><br>He just lacks the sheer dickishness that Adlet's techniques allow.

Fuck off.</br>  <br><br>Not even close, dude.</br></br>  <br>I know it's Goldof but what's he attacking?</br>  Jesus christ, the fucking framerate in that scene where it pams around them in a circle that lasts like a solid minute. If I was one of those people who got motion sickness from watching things, that would have me bent over throwing up my dinner.  <br>He really is Aztec Batman, no denying it.</br>  bunny a qt  <br>The animation and character models sure is QUALITY in this episode.</br>  <br>Which volume?</br>  "Alright guys, everyone write down your name and your experience of getting your mark on a piece of paper. That way we can identify the traitor and move on." <br><br>Not that I don't like this element of the story, but I thought of that the second I saw the symbol appear on Adlet and knew there were 7 braves. For the sake of practicality, not the story, I kind of wish someone would do this.</br></br>  how come red doesn't know the difference between a kyouma from his elbow?  <br>just wait and see how the strongest man solve that shit</br>  <br>Because he isn't the smartest man in the world.</br>  <br> Waste of time, it's easy to lie and these legends are well known, especially by Saints. </br>  I am out of the loop, can anyone tell me what is this stuff about bunny fucking a dog? and why is she a liar?  <br>4</br>  <br>What could he be attacking? Humans? You don't even need to read it to guess it.<br><br>It was a shapeshifting Kyoma, the elbow is no an indication.</br></br></br>  so what's the point of every hero using generic fantasy powers when a homeless can beat them with tricks and gadgets.  <br>Yeah, but I imagine that the exact process of getting the mark is mostly unspoken of. I mean, Adlet knew everything there was to know but he was still shocked by getting his.</br>  I just started watching this.<br><br>Spoil EVERYTHING for me.</br></br>  So Miyuki Sawashiro only narrated the intro?<br>And now even that part was gone.

For me, it's the Seraph of the End fanbase. I'll give you one word. Tumblr. Need I fucking say more? Your turn.  <br>/a/</br>  naruto  <br>  using a tumblr image <br>Every shounen hit of the season</br></br>  <br>I used a Tumblr image to make a point.</br>  <br> not liking Yaoi or Yuri <br>You have some shit taste.</br></br>  <br>Yaoi's cool. Tumblr fangirls that are so far detached from the actual series they love and just ship characters aren't cool though. They're cancer. Tumblr is cancer. Shipping is cancer. I'm cancer.</br>  <br>You probably are cancer just most of the time your immune system crushes before you become too cancerous.</br>  <br>wut</br>  The most obnoxious are Gainax fans, the two worst are Eva and TTGL. The former fanbase is a psuedo-intellectual cesspit of people who think it's the most meaningful anime ever created and the latter is some bizzaro combination of the former and the worst Naruto/Bleach shounenfags who claim that it saved them and made them better people.<br><br>Best anime fans are those who don't consider themselves part of any one fanbase and watch oft-overlooked shows on merit rather than popularity.</br></br>   What's the most cancerous anime fanbase you can think of? <br>kyoani moefags in general. Just look at the hibikek fanbase</br>  <br>How the fuck do you know about tumblr fanbases without going on tumblr?<br><br>Nearly everything has fans on tumblr anyway, it's a fuckhuge website.</br></br></br>  <br>Fate is worse, by far.</br>  <br>fate/type-meme /end</br>  Here it is, hot off the press. Leaking it here on /a/ a little bit earlier than it going up on Batoto because once it goes up on Batoto, I have to make a tumblr post and tumblr users have been fucking annoying this week in regards to the chapter so here's a reward for not being... well, that.<br><br>Anyway, this chapter was interesting. It's rare we get 3 whole plot chapters in a row. There's more Karera being adorably irresponsible, then we get some confirmation on a lot of info we kind of all already know, and then shit gets pretty fuckin real. So without further ado, enjoy. <br><br>(side note: If anyone is able and willing to do some cleaning work here and there, we'd really appreciate it. Email to ota.raws@gmail.com thank you for consideration)</br></br></br></br>              I'm pleasantly surprised that I didn't even have to come up with the profanity to use (instead of the stock anime insult "bastard") in this page. Good job Kewl          <br><br>Looking mighty Jotaro there Gappy.</br></br>                  <br>Looking pretty masculine in the top right panel there Karera.</br>        i guess this chapter might seem shorter than usual because tadaaaah it's all spreads  Wans't there a page about Karera getting burned in fire?    <br>dude spoilers</br>    I'm sort of getting tired of the fact that Gappy only has two facial expressions (mildly confused and mildly pissed off). Maybe he has too much Jotaro in him?    <br><br>She's pretty cute when drawn like a woman.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Goddamn. Araki never even drew this many spreads in a row during his shounen days. He must have spent more time than usual on this chapter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  whoops i'd forgotten to typeset this one. Sorry for the delay here  <br>There's been a few SBR chapters with lots of spreads, and I think some earlier chapters of this part like during born this way had lots of spreads</br>    Again, I've been wondering. Are you going to clean and typeset these chapters again when the tankobons come out?  <br>I think that's the least stylish series of attacks I've ever seen in Jojo. Still neat though.</br>  <br> the entire left side <br>I can see your underwear?</br></br>  <br><br>As strange as it may sound, it seems araki is experimenting with realism in this series, sometimes.</br></br>  <br>Reminds me of Westwood, except the JoJo here is built.</br>  <br>I really dunno if we'll get to these later ones... But actually, yeah we're about to release JoJolion 2.5 HD ReMix once Kewl gets back from Otakon</br>  So how crazy would the fights get if Araki saw Raid 1 and 2?  <br>Yeah that makes a lot of sense, there's something still charming about his weird designs having a really bland exchange. Good contrast to the other fights.</br>  <br>There's definitely a lot of experimenting going on in JJL compared to earlier arcs...</br>  <br>Damn, wires.<br><br><br>He's gonna retranslate the entire chapter from the tankobons?<br><br><br>Not much since he must have seen a lot of Jackie Chan and Jet Li already.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand that's the end! Thanks for reading. This should be up on batoto by the end of the night. Just waiting for Kewl to get back to his hotel room and take of his Dainenjiyama cosplay and then upload everywhere  <br>Thank you for sharing.</br>  <br>Nice blog.</br>  <br>Well, keep in mind that fights in the Raid series are more like Araki's fights. Not the tactics part, but people taking stupidly high amounts of brutal damage and then stepping their game up anyways.</br>  <br> We're changing the order  <br><br>WHO ORDERED THEM TO DO THIS<br><br>JOBIN YOU FUCK ITS YOU ISNT IT <br><br>Jobin is the fucking main villain I know it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He looks over chapters and fixes translations that need adjustment (due to them either being old translations or because of future knowledge gained from mag chapters). No need to completely retranslate the chapters. Only thing that has to be redone is... *shudder* editing...<br><br>Here's some pages from v02 now. I don't wanna dump the whole thing until Kewl's had the chance to look over it but I can drop some of the title pages and stand info ones</br></br></br>  <br> people taking stupidly high amounts of brutal damage and then stepping their game up anyways <br>Like in a lot of anime and manga?</br></br>    Why is everyone so confused and lethargic  <br>Order as in the order they're killing (or attacking, whatever) them in. Karera was their first priority it seems, but now as he said they've changed the order to have Josuke be first. You idiot.</br>  <br>Pretty sure they meant the actual order of who they were going to attack. i.e. attacking Gappy first and Karera later.</br>    <br>No Gappy. Trying to expose your chest like Yasuho isn't normal.</br>    <br>Gappy looks extra creepy here</br>  I can't wait for this page to replace the version of the tile page where the Gomi scans people didn't  ERASE THAT STRAND OF MY HAIR THAT FELL ON THE SCANNER     <br> Kewl to get back to his hotel room and take of his Dainenjiyama cosplay <br><br>Are there pictures of him?</br></br></br>  oh yeah, we're gonna add in the artbook scan for this page I think as well.  <br>He posted a pic on his twitter (same as his name anywhere else) yesterday or two days ago</br>      <br>You must have had an easier time redrawing that than us redrawing this.</br>    <br>lol fuck part 5 redraws<br><br>I tried to help out with JJP on it but then I got to the Sex Pistols title pages and *fart*<br><br>Anyway that's all I have to dump from v02 right now but look forward to the full release soon. I'm gonna go watch a movie now, thanks for reading.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank NearZero for spending hours on that page. Also, watch Ant-Man.</br>  <br><br><br>Please tell me there are more of these. That is the one thing i missed in part 8 is the stand bios.<br><br>I wanna know what the crazy hand thing the new rock guy has is called.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He is the roman reigns of jojos</br>  <br>Crazy Hand?</br>  <br>Is..is it really called crazy hand? surely its not.</br>  <br>My bad, it's actually Master Hand</br>  Other thread is cancerous as fuck<br><br/></br>  <br>What happened to Idealism-anon and Shirou-anon?</br>  <br>Come join /Jojo/'s Bizarre Threadventure, anons!</br>  <br>Not sure, but they're probably sucking each other's cocks right about now</br>  <br>90% of all Jojo threads nowadays are pure cancer</br>  <br>I sorta want to draw them as jojo's right now. That thread was special.</br>  <br>Do that, but make sure to draw one without them sucking each others' cocks too ok? I want at least one normal one</br>  <br>But how would you draw Idealism!Anon? Shirou!Anon would be Shirou of course</br>  <br>I wonder why I switched from alpha as fuck  big guys  pre-gay priest to twinky faggots post-gay priest?  haven't read jojolion but all johnny does is fucking whine and get shot </br>  <br>Shit.okay<br><br>Alright then. I know Moral-anon will just be shirou. Idealism-anon is like Pucci and DIO's love child.<br>What will their's stand's name's be?</br></br></br></br>  I am fucking mad that the guy who made this pic didn't add the "So, who do you bet that is going to win?" posts and it's reposts.<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128559<wbr>633/#q128600265</wbr></br>  <br>Fret not, Jojo's Bizarre Threadventure will never end</br>  <br><br>What I don't like about powers like this that require you to get close enough to the person you're attacking to touch them, is that you could just stab them if you were able to get that close without even using a Stand. And it seems like that's all he wants to do, is kill her, not extract information from her or anything.</br></br>  <br>Is King Nothing the only stand in JoJolion that isn't touch-activated?</br>  <br>It was free my nigga, calm down, edit it however you like<br><br> Also I didn't even see anything below the inclusion of DIO </br></br></br>  <br> edit it however you like <br>I am not even in my home, i am posting this from my cellphone, and i will probaly only be back in ~5 days</br></br>  <br>thanks mang!</br>  <br><br>Soft &amp; Wet, Fun Fun Fun, Paisley Park, Born This Way, and Les Feuilles aren't. Not sure about Nut King Call.</br></br>  <br>Please put it in the image<br>I will pay with smug reaction images ;-;</br></br>  <br>When I'm done eating I'll add them and reduce the size of the file so that it doesn't go over the upload limit</br>  <br>Based</br>  <br>I'm not sure if it's because of summer or the anime ending, but they've been so much worse lately.</br>    <br>OH SHIT!</br>    Does is ever explain how fast gay priest can go with made in human? In the chart it says infinite but anyone know how many mph?  oh no, gay priest has been stopped by a filthy Joestar!  Stop.  <br><br>Fuck your struggle.</br></br>  <br>Gay priest has escaped!</br>  Gay priest got here? woo!  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Stop.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  god all this shit from the other threads is awful make it stop<br><br>now I'm REALLY glad I never take the bait and post chapter dumps over there <br><br>this is why I constantly shit on the JoJo fanbase as a whole nowadays</br></br></br></br>   Those last few pages <br>Shit I have a feeling this is gonna be the best fight yet.</br>     tfw there are people who hate Gay Priest.   <br>Araki is so kawaii.<br><br>Also, Josuke is "blessed" with 4 balls.</br></br></br>  <br>I hate this "Gay Priest" meme, but not Pucci.</br>  <br>Pucci is my waifu and I fucking hate you and all of the other avatarfags. You clog up every thread with stupid bullshit that only underage b8s would find funny.</br>  <br> This whole chapter <br>The wait is gonna fucking kill me.</br></br>  <br>Such is the fate of any series that gets popular.<br><br>Degenerate Normalfags being shitting themselves and lack decorum and proper etiquette.<br><br>Revolting</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't even know who you're insulting anymore.</br>  <br><br> He's spreading to other boards. He's gonne be here forever. </br></br>  So we've got a pretty clear idea of how the missing hand stand works, but do we have any indication of what zipperball does?  These rockmen are butt ugly.  Kenshiro as drawn by Araki  <br>Your bullshit  has nothing to do with threads like </br>  Do these guys have the same stand or do they share it?<br>Is it even a stand?</br>  <br>It's probably like those eleven men that share the same Stand.</br>  <br>No, the one person posting it will leave once school starts up again.<br><br>It was bearable when it was just pucci_after.png, but now that some idiot is trying to spread it out to like 10 images it's fucking insufferable.</br></br></br>  <br>Here's what i said</br>  <br/>  <br><br><br>This is it</br></br></br>  <br>Combine that with avatarfagging and it's even worse.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Pretty  rare stuff </br></br></br></br>  <br> putting Their thoughts and actions are utterly unclouded - they are those of   topkek <br> not All my money on Shirou!Anon, he's fucking crazy for even pushing this in the first place. <br>Oh c'mon anon<br>Otherwise, bretty gud, saved</br></br></br></br>  Now how do you cosplay as this guy?  <br>If their Stand isn't called YinYang or they aren't renamed as such for volume 11 I'm gonna be disappointed.</br>  <br>You mean Ying Yang after the rap group.</br>  <br>Yeah that one<br><br><br>a lot of sweaters apparently</br></br></br></br>  <br>By the way, have you figured out what the song Speed King has to do with Jobin?</br>  <br>And combine all that with the shitty roleplay. It's funny how much better these threads were when the anime was airing, now a bunch of kids who never lurked and don't know how to post on 4chan are pretending they're on tumblr/reddit and shitting up threads.<br><br> 6/Puccifags have a terrible rep to begin with, and now this is making everything worse </br></br></br>  <br>I think the roleplaying and avatarfagging and all that were really starting when the anime was about to end.</br>  <br>Sorry, the thoughts and actions one was mine, I couldn't think of anything but i had to put something. (I'm not the editor, just some other anon)</br>  <br>wait, is this the fanart you drew? Because it looked a lot like Dio and Pucci's love child, too much like it for it to not be fanart</br>  <br>That's a character from another anime, you motherfucker.</br>  <br>See <br>That is Archer from Carnival Phantasm. Are you insane?</br></br>  <br> I'm the drawfag. That's fucking archer from Fate.</br>  <br>See Carnival Phantasm and the Fate/Stay Ngiht VN.</br>  <br>Are you serious?</br>    <br><br><br><br><br>Forgot to say that I'm a newfag I've barely watched any animu</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can some guy add this post in there? I would do it myself but my font is different<br>I am not even the guy who requested the votation to be there, i just want to see +1 vote for Shirou!Anon in the image.</br></br>  <br>Atleast you're honest.</br>  <br>I guess haha. I'm assuming Carnaval Phantasm is breddy good?</br>  <br>I liked it.</br>    <br>Is t just me or is s&amp;w's design a little different than before?</br>  <br>It's armor plates and chest now resemble hearts more.</br>  <br>It's a lot of inside jokes about the fate/ series so I hope you're ready to read through like three George R.R. Martin novels' worth of shitty anime dating sims and edgy grimdark novellas before you watch Carny Phantom<br><br><br><br>Yeah it's a lot more squat too</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cus he's in lurve with Yasuho?</br>  What other characters in fiction have gotten Kakyoin'd?  <br>Yeah I'm not ready   yet  </br>  <br>Dio<br>Buccialatte Grande</br></br>  HOTPANTS<br>O<br>T<br>P<br>A<br>N<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Let's start with this one.</br>  <br>I'm ebil?</br>    Off topic (well i guess the thread has long since derailed so wtf does it matter) but if anyone here follows Kitoh I'm doing another chapter dump tonight before I pass out <br><br/></br>    <br>Think about it this way. He gets faster because MIH speeds up time for him and everyone lags behind. MIH also keeps increasing this speed until the universe literally collapses within itself.<br><br>So yeah, infinite sounds about right.</br></br></br>  Here's the face of my Idealism-anon. To tired to flip it. <br> If it's good enough I'll show the entire body. </br>  <br> You really did it <br>This should be "You got me~" or thereabouts.</br></br>  <br>I think it's good, but then again I suck at judging. Show the rest anyway</br>  <br>A little bit of everything in there.<br>Go ahead and post the full body.</br></br>    <br><br>I'll go ahead and use my scanner for it then. Then. Won't take long.</br></br>  <br><br><br>You can just feel the SUFFERING and INTERNAL MONOLOGUING coming out of these. Bravo Araki for inspiring brighter generations of Kakyoin.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm hoping the rest of the body isn't a giant penis</br>  <br>I like the foreground style Araki keeps using like on Gappy on this page</br>  <br>We Are   Groot   Kakyoin</br>  Here we go. I can draw him again wearing actual clothes later. Just wanted to get the gist of how he looks.<br> Is it okay?  </br>  So does she genuinely become a love interest and show any dere whatsoever?<br>Or can I just drop it now?</br>  On chapter 80 myself<br>She doesn't understand what love is, she's incredibly dense, and she's still bitter at MC.</br>  She will win the soumabowl but it will take a lot of chapters.  <br>She dies due to food poisoning later.</br>  No romance at all so far. She wants to fuck Souma's dad, but doesn't know he's Souma's dad, so she'll probably want to fuck Souma too once she's realizes. Only Ameritits and Moeblob have shown any romantic interest in Souma so far, and Moeblob only just recently.  I wonder what "Have you worshiped Erina-sama today yet" anon thinks about this.  <br>Moeblob is more like, admiration. Ameritits is head over heels about Souma tho.</br>  Shit scans never.  Wait, is Erina actually the official love interest of the MC?<br><br>I thought it would be Tadokoro, because she's cliched enough to make it work. And you know how the Japanese love their cliches.</br></br>  <br>That one looks great. It makes me want to get one and I'm not even a Erinafag.</br>  <br>Do you have like, zero sense for storybuilding?</br>  <br>I'm wondering if they quit now.<br><br><br>5th Erina figure?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>why would anyone want this bitch to win? <br><br>why not root for the girl that actually likes him and hasn't been a bitch since the beginning?</br></br></br></br>  <br>This. Erina a shit. Megumi is the only actual perfect candidate for Souma, and Meat is 10/10 breeding stock. Why waste your time with a subpar bitch who wants to fuck your dad?</br>  Why care about Erina if Tadokoro is so much better?  <br>There is no official love interest. All girls in this series can be considered a love interest. The most popular girl will win.</br>  <br>  Liking Meat </br>  Right now Erina respects his skill butt hates his style and methods and goes full spaghetti when talking to him. But unlike in the election she is in full "you are never allowed to fail ever" mode because he wormed his way into minor cooking fame.  <br> All girls in this series can be considered a love interest <br> All girls <br>Really anon?</br></br></br>  <br>She's actually developing at a really nice rate. In the latest arc she manages to have a conversation with Soma without being a bitch, she was even somewhat helpful. It helps that Hisako (due to plot reasons) goes wingman mode for Soma. I think the turn is being made very believable.</br>  <br>A Fumio-san ending is coming. I can feel it.</br>  <br> All girls <br>No.</br></br>  <br>I like Megumi better than Erina but the chemistry and interactions Erina has with Souma is more entertaining for me.</br>  <br>This. It will take many moons.</br>  <br> All girls </br>  anyone actually want to discuss the manga instead of devolving into the usual best girl/ takumi takumi shitposting?    <br><br>It's a Jump manga. Just by being the poster girl she has a 99 percent of winning. Although at the current pace, It'll be a while for anything romantic to happen.</br></br>  <br> All girls in this series can be considered a love interest <br>We read the same manga?</br></br>  <br> Ryoko wants the Smokebowl. <br> Yuuki doesn't care. <br> Alice will probably get Ryou   or Hayama <br> Hisako, Houjou and Nao are bro tier. <br> all girls. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Nisekoi is Jump's, too <br> Tadokoro = Onodera <br> Erina = Chitoge <br><br>I see.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   muh MEHgumi getting friendzoned   <br> Nisekoi: Cooking Edition <br><br>Excepting the fact that Chitoge is a huge bitch <br>And that Tadokoro admires Souma but doesn't love him deeply or anything   Yet  </br></br></br></br>  No one will win, you fools. Have you learned nothing?  <br>*Isn't<br>Fuck me</br></br>  <br>The author said someone will win.</br>  Doesn't seem like anything definitively romantic will happen ever. It'll probably end with some generic timeskip ending where the girls welcome Souma back from some world training thing.<br><br><br>She definitely loves him. She's had a few of those "why did Souma-kun just flash through my mind and why is my heart going doki doki" moments already.</br></br></br>    <br>only two girls have romantic interest in him at the moment, and Meat was a bitch at the beginning. So you are rooting for Kurase. Interesting choice.</br>  <br>My feelings are so hurt that I guess I'll stop posting forever.</br>  <br>  She definitely loves him <br>The author says otherwise</br></br>  <br>Gonna need a link to something dude.</br>  I need proofs that display souma's skills as a lolimancer.  <br> She definitely loves him. She's had a few of those "why did Souma-kun just flash through my mind and why is my heart going doki doki" moments already. <br>No (word of god)</br></br>  <br> jun　　　  will turn soumasexual soon enough</br>  <br> Oh, and during that talk they also mentioned Erina is not actually Souma's true route but just the first candidate for it (and that Ikumi has two older brothers, but I guess that's kinda trivial) <br> When they were talking about that topic they only made it clear that the girl who Souma will end up with isn't set on stone yet <br> What they did mention about Megumi is that she's not actually in love with Souma yet, that so far she just admires him <br><br>Source: Eru13, Casanova's translator.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ask casanova translator</br>  <br>Around which chapter was this? Because this shit seems plain as day.</br>  <br>Post Autumn Election's</br>  True route is  Takumi's boypussy   <br> When they were talking about that topic they only made it clear that the girl who Souma will end up with isn't set on stone yet <br>So...aka I'll choose the ship when I need to end the series. I hope my fans enjoy the wars and keep reading my shit until then.</br></br>  <br>Souma lost his chance  now that's gigganigga's </br>  <br>And you'll still read it every week. Those dicks!</br>  <br>More like, Erina is the default, but I can change my mind whenever I want to and pick candidate #2 or #3 or whichever.</br>  Erina a shit.<br><br>Worse than Emi and Kirino.</br></br>  Where are shit scans at? Even black clover gets translated quicker than SnS why?  <br>this<br><br>why are people assuming that Megumi has a romantic interest on Souma?</br></br></br>  <br>We're always the last one to get translations. At least we don't need to wait until Monday for Viz  sometimes. </br>  <br>To be fair, it's basically a given that both she and Erina will eventually.<br><br>Unlike what some people think though, I don't believe Tsukuda will stack more girls in though. The series has a bunch of other good looking, talented guys. Unlike harem series which tend to have a passable MC and ugly, useless, or super perverted side guys to try to make sense of all the girls liking one guy instead of having different tastes in guys.</br></br></br>  I "root" for Megumi to elevate the levels butthurt when their delusions are outright denied.  <br>It literally says chapter 61 on the scan</br>  <br>I know his phrasing is odd, but he's asking when jump festa was, which another anon already answered.</br>  We'll never get scans of this, right?  <br> during that talk <br>Was this an interview? Can I read/watch it somewhere?</br></br>  <br>Is it new? Because maybe. We've been getting more scans lately.</br>  <br>Yes, it was at Jump Festa. <br>https://mangahelpers.com/forum/show<wbr>thread.php/2999410-Shokugeki-no-Som<wbr>a-103-Discussion-104-Predictions/pa<wbr>ge12<br>Read Eru13's posts.</br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>It will be out at Comiket 88.</br>  <br> The most popular girl will win. <br><br>So Erina then?<br><br>She basically disappeared for like 60 chapters (or however long the Fall arc was) and still beat every other girl by a good margin.</br></br></br></br></br>  So while we are still stuck waiting for a translation, in this arc, we still need to learn what Kuga's deal with Tsukasa is, what Eizan and Rindou are up to, and who the mysterious figure Souma gave a key to is, right?  <br> they also mentioned Erina is not actually Souma's true route but just the first candidate for it <br> they only made it clear that the girl who Souma will end up with isn't set on stone yet <br>Literally what else can they say? "Oh yeah, Erina is going to win the Soumab owl, she was going to win from the very beginning." They would have killed the manga if they said it outright because as we all know, WSJ mangafags are filthy shippers who throw autistic shitstorms when their waifu loses. Noncommittal answers are the norm in these sorts of interviews. Shit, Shokugeki is only in its second year.<br><br><br> that argument <br>Holy shit, this is why I avoid forums.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's a Jump manga. Just by being the poster girl she has a 99 percent of winning. <br>Yup, just like in Ichigo 100%... oh wait.<br><br>Seriously, I don't really know why you think that's a trend.</br></br></br></br>  <br> One vote. </br>  <br>Hand was mysterious girl from chapter 117. <br>Or maybe Houjou.</br></br>  <br>is she the best prodigy in the school / or we can expect an uberchef even more amazing than her?</br>  <br>Not him but it is a trend, for what it's worth (half the manga in WSJ have asexual protags who don't even end up with a girl in the end anyway). Ichigo 100 was the exception.<br><br>Even Nurarihyon no Mago (which was set up to have the human childhood friend win) changed track and decisively went with Tsurara end, which was what everyone wanted.<br><br><br>Read the manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Best of the school is an autist </br>  <br>Read the manga.<br> She's only 10th seat at Elite Ten.  </br></br>  <br>I could believe Houjou since she's a big girl, but those hands were pretty big for a girl otherwise.</br>  <br>yeah but she's just in first year, she probably get first seat by the end of the year</br>  <br>There are 9 upperclassmen ranked above her. As for being best prodigy in the school, yeah, probably. The school has apparently never had a first year as strong as her.</br>  <br>Next year Isshiki or maybe Yugi will get First seat, not Erina.</br>  <br> only 10th seat <br>Reminder that she's probably better than Kuga and Eizan but got 10th because seniority.<br><br>And that white hair looks terrible on Tsukasa, they should've made it silvery like Alice's.</br></br></br></br>  <br>that looks beautiful from this angle</br>  <br> Isshiki <br>almost certainly<br><br> Yugi <br>don't fuck with me, anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this</br>  <br> Yugi <br> will probably be raped by Souma within the year, if not in this festival <br>Right.</br></br></br>  <br>It's Isshiki or Yugi next year. I don't want Yugi to be First Seat but who knows.</br>  <br><br> implying it won't be based Aizen </br></br>  <br>wrong manga m8.</br>  <br>I'm glad you realized that Orihime will win in Bleach.<br><br>Not many people know.<br><br><br>I wonder how much this costs.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn that's amazing.</br>  <br>I wonder who is stronger, Aizen or Isshiki.</br>   you can finally make her taste your cum   <br>ALL ME.</br>  <br>Glad she won she was best girl and his childhood friend was shit.</br>  https://mega.nz/#F!6oBxSK6R!WE_h49q<wbr>ll-J-NjqTuJ1kaw<br><br>Recipe pages.<br><br>Was to lazy to do a proper crop and edit, if anyone want to do all that hard work, there you have it.<br>Still missing some pages, had some trouble scanning them.</br></br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>Orihime is cute.<br><br>It looks even better up close</br></br></br>  <br>Drop it. Also please consider getting some taste when watching anime.</br>  <br> dat cute smug face <br> dem thighs </br></br>  <br>She wasn't entirely dissappeared though. She was there for the most chapter on the election but mostly just a few panels and that's it. She always appeared when soma is on the stage, and when she was asked by soma to taste his stew. But yeah, she wasn't as much of an important character that time</br>  <br>I asked earlier but this is her 5th figure isn't it? Also, I see they put up a space on the official site for Meat's figure but they have no image up yet. I remember seeing the prototype for hers and Megumi's though.</br>  <br>Read the manga faggot<br><br>She doesn't want to fuck Souma's dad you illiterate, she was amazed by his cooking and wanted to taste it as a child</br></br></br>  <br> implying <br><br>We laugh at Aizen because he hadn't backed up his threats from the Autumn Election, but keep in mind Mimasaka was only one of many goons he has. And we know he's great with business. Souma must not underestimate him.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm here and I think this is amazing.<br><br>Have you worshipped Erina today, anon?</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you, based anon. Will you scan the missing pages later?</br>  <br> doesn't want to fuck <br> blushes every time she sees / hears about him <br> sleeps with a photo of him <br><br>Okay, anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Erina will get 4th - 5th seat by her second year.</br>  <br>Yep, gonna post them tomorrow.</br>  <br> Hotgluing figures <br>Fuck no that damages them.</br></br>  <br>I'm usually not a buyfag, but I may just have to get this.</br>  <br>Thanks. Now we just need to translate this and the novels  translations soon. </br>  <br>He's also up to something during the festival it seems.<br><br><br>Honestly won't be surprised if she hits 3rd. With 5 people graduating, 5th would appear to be a given though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This was said last thread or thread before last, but not every emotion a woman feels for a man has to be lust, you depraved degenerate.<br><br>He's her favorite cook and she wants to taste his food, it's called admiration.</br></br></br>  <br> anime only <br>It's taken about 130 chapters but she's finally defrosting from maximum tsun to casual tsun. <br>She'll be full dere in about 500 episodes, just you wait.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to taste her D.</br>  <br>I don't think you understand human emotion. She's shown all the signs of wanting to fuck him, all that is left is for her to meet him again.</br>  <br>Erina has no such thing</br>  Honestly I want Hisako to win because out every female character in this series she has the best chemistry with Soma. Better than Megumi's and definitely Erina. You cannot say other otherwise. I mean when both Hisako and worked together they actually looked like real couple keeping a restaurant together.<br><br>But seeing this is a Shonen manga best girl will not win and worst girl will win fucking Erina. In the millionth chance Hisako wins the Somabowl I would shit my pants.</br></br>  <br>Not that anon, but since it was directly addressed in the manga, she does not. Alice even asked her if she had any interest in dating this mysterious man, and Erina was confused about why on earth she would want to do that.</br>  <br>Hisako won't even fall for him.</br>  <br>Do you think she might try to rise up on her first year?</br>  <br>Eh, more like he stirred up Giga and just let him do his thing. Eizan's been pretty passive since his big threat and his personal showdown with Soma probably won't happen for a long time.<br>Especially since Kuga is probably going to wipe the floor with Soma in an actual shokugeki after Soma wins the right to d-d-d-duel him with his festival shenanigans.</br></br>  <br>No. She's a rival to be impressed, nothing more.</br>  <br>Alright c'mon, you can't be serious, fucking Hisami is more relevent than Hisako, why would she even be in the soumabowl to begin with, she was a hater of souma, she was there to represent the hatred of the student body for Souma, he showed her he wasn't just talk and helped her out without thinking about her as a obstacle or a rival, you can be delusional as a meat-fag, but Hisako, c'mon Anon.</br>  <br>Are you actually retarded?<br><br>Erina is only now being gradually introduced to the concepts of love and relationships, but you want to imply she wants to fuck Saiba?<br><br>She even asked Alice why she would ever date him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Soma has chemistry with all the grills, but Hisako a best because she's the perfect interim between Dereless and Goomy.</br>  <br> chemistry <br><br>You're delusional. Contempt is not chemistry.</br></br></br>  <br>Who is Hisami?</br>  <br> false flagging <br> muh chemistry <br>You're probably one of those bandwagonfags who didn't give a shit about her before she was named. This manga hasn't even hit 150 chapters and they're all in their first year, developments happen slowly.<br><br>Christ, I hate faggots like you who proclaim the "literally perfection" girl as best and MC's fated waifu when they've no reason nor room to improve. Girls like Hisako are wonderful in their own way but it won't make for a satisfying story in the long run. Also, she would probably want Erina to win.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, I took a random generic Japanese name to emphasize my point</br>  <br>To be fair she was completely clueless about love at that point.</br>  <br>Dish anon, this a christian board.</br>  <br>I don't know if she has interest in the shokugeki for a seat method. She's definitely been doing the increasing her resources, influence, and standing part though. We'll have to wait and see.</br>  <br>Hisako would be the ultimate Serina shipper</br>  <br><br>Are you serious, I thought you meant Isami.</br></br>  <br>I-I knew that anon</br>  <br> Soma has chemistry with all the grills <br>This</br></br>  <br> probably thinks Erina is best girl <br><br>Even with improvements she's still going to be shit. Pretty much every girl is better than her.</br></br></br>  I imagine we'll have to wait until monday for confirmation on Sugita voicing Eizan.<br><br>He should be in the next ep on the phone with that woman, right?</br></br>  <br>Oh, I might have done that subconsciously</br>  <br>The Erina haters have arrived</br>  <br>I knew it was you when this was posted <br><br> Even with improvements she's still going to be shit <br>What does this even mean?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot the very 1st</br>  Am I hallucinating but where the fuck did all these Erinafags come from?  <br>It's the same deluded fuckstick, no one sane likes Erina or wishes her well.</br>  <br>Glad I waited, almost bought the bikini one.</br>  <br><br> being stuck in 2013 </br></br>  <br>will souma get the first seat?</br>  <br>You must be new here</br>  <br>He is a stupid anon that can only look at Erina for what she was in the first chapter and will ignore all development. It kinda sucks but it seems like the wrong people finally picked the anime up from their backlog and are now starting shitty waifuwars. There goes the decent threads this had.</br>  <br>Too bad for you, Erina is going to win the Soumabowl, there were more hint for this dropped troughout the whole manga than foodgasm, I'm a Yoshinofag ( that fucking exist ) but you have to be autistic to not see it</br>  <br>We've always had the largest fanbase<br><br>It's just there's tons of false flaggers and othergirlfags are more aggressive towards Erina.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe his third year. Second year he'll be seat 3 and be raging that he's not sitting in at least his dad's chair already.</br>  <br>No until 3rd year</br>  <br>  hurr durr they don't like what I like they must be insane <br>Sure anon</br></br>  What's the problem of not getting the Soumabowl?<br><br> All the boys are best boys </br></br>  <br>MMMMM yes imagine the fat loads she going to received.</br>  My old HDD crashed and I lost my Erina folder<br><br>Help me rebuild fags</br></br>  <br><br>Samefag. Go take your crazy meds, loser.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br> all these figures of Erina <br> not even ONE in her cutie chef outfit with toque <br><br>Why even cook?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not the purple swimsuit <br>Damn it.</br></br>  <br>Souma will make it into the E10 for 2nd year, but he'll be in the bottom half along with any other non Erina first year who makes it.</br>  <br>Correct.</br>  <br>Fuck off Erinafag. I've liked Hisako ever since she cut the turtle's neck off. So saying I've liked her just now is stupid. The only reason she was like that in the beginning was because she was stuck with Erina.</br>  <br>Unlike LN harem MCs, Souma is actually a great guy all around. OP cook, witty, friendly to everyone, fun-loving. Even the guys love hanging out with him.<br><br><br>Sorry to disappoint you.</br></br></br></br>  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ERINA!  <br>You could be right. He could be down at #6 or something, but the butthurt would be more immense if he made it to #3 and his dad finds out and fucks with him about it.</br>    <br>This<br>She doesn't consider fine to me also but is getting better recently<br> Try convince me that she couldn't become actual best girl after beaten by Soma if by chance </br></br></br>  <br> Meat still relevant.  <br><br>This is the last time we'll see her in a popularity poll, right?</br></br></br>  <br>You're late today</br>  <br> with any other non Erina first year who makes it <br>Hayama,Ryou and Alice?</br></br>  <br> Non-Erinafags confirmed for full blown /a/utists <br><br><br> You will never teach your kid how to cook <br><br> Because nobody will ever likes you </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't believe it, you're always here to faithfully spam those renders.<br><br><br> reading comprehension </br></br></br></br>  Holy fuck are Erinafags cancerous. I just want a decent discussion about cooking not all this waifu shit of Erina.  <br>Hopefully.</br>  <br>Doubt it. Big tits are usually all that's required to keep a Nip's attention.</br>  <br>Not really she seems to have gotten a power boost. Depends on the author.</br>  <br><br> 15 years old <br> looks like she's heading beeline for chirstmas cake bracket </br></br></br>  <br>yeah, still no chef outfit. If I remember correctly, the figures are<br><br>bikini<br>uniform sitting<br>uniforms standing, arms crossed (this was sold as a set with a Souma one)<br>standing and offering a dish<br>and now this one sitting on the throne.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Christ can you seriously fuck off the only retard being cancerous is you.</br>  <br><br>Didn't someone say they were going to scan the cookbook? What happened with that?</br></br>  <br> HISAKO IS BEST GIRL <br> MEAT IS BEST GIRL <br> MEGUMI IS BEST GIRL <br> I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ALDINI <br> Erinafag sure are cancerous </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Read the thread.</br>  <br><br> complaining about waifufags on /a/ <br> /a/  <br> a board about anime/mango where waifufaggotry is an integrated part of the board's community <br><br>That's like complaining about paragraphs in /lit/<br><br>Then go to </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Where were you guys when Spice won the Alicebowl?  <br>I uploaded some on imgur before the fall<br><br>More pls</br></br></br>  <br> I just want a decent discussion about cooking <br>Yes, we all know Shokugeki no Souma is a cooking manga.<br><br>Honestly though, the cooking part of recent chapters has been covered over and over. And in this arc it isn't cooking so much as business strategies and self-marketing.<br><br><br> I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ALDINI <br>This is a thing now?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I am enlightened. Thank you.</br>    <br>I am strangely attracted to this idea. The skin contrast alone would be erotic.</br>  <br> I just want a decent discussion about cooking <br>Go make a Hells Kitchen or Oishinbo thread, then.</br></br>  <br> &gt;This is a thing now? <br><br>This wouldn't even surprise me if it were<br><br><br>I have anime ones if you want</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Would Erina be the type to accept running a Home Family Restaurant with Soma? That's why I can't see Erina winning the Somabowl because she isn't the type to drop her status and everything to run a family restaurant with someone.<br><br>Someone who accepts that and together run a little Family restaurant will win the Somabowl</br></br></br>  <br>Boy do I not like that Indian. Kuro and Takumi are fine, so it's not like I want only Souma as the male character, but man do I not like brown town guy.</br>  <br>Yuuki and Ryoko want the Souma from an investment standpoint, assuming he'll grow up into a man like Jouichirou.</br>  <br>In that case, Megumi has this in the bag.</br>  <br>N-n-no<br><br>S-s-stop<br><br>Any Erina is fine for me</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bullshit,Currynigger a shit</br>  <br><br><br> someone bash on Megumi with "mehgoomy"  <br> no one bats an eye and that one megumibro tries to talk it out but gets circlejerked the fuck out <br> someone bashes Nikumi  <br> everyone circlejerks that she's irrelevant and one-dimensional when the nikubros tend to keep to themselves and not shit on the thread <br> bash on Hisako <br> everyone calls her "lel erina second banana" and treat her like a consolation prize <br> someone bashes Erina <br> OMG MEHGOOMY FAGS ANIMEONLYFAGS WHY ARE YOU SO BLIND SHES PERFECT I WANT TO CUM INSIDE HER SHES LE DERE IN LATER CHAPTERS YOU SECONDARY FUCK REEEEEEEE <br><br>Truly they are the cancerous waifufags in SnS. I really wish Tsukuda ends up BTFO them by letting her lose the Somabowl. Sadly, that won't be the case.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought most of /a/ liked cocky faggots? What happened?</br>  <br>This strategy meeting was after the second day, right? I wonder how they've turned things around now that we are reaching the 4th. Where do you guys think this team will rank at the end?</br>  <br> Ryoko  <br>She want smoke D ick </br></br>  <br>Her settling down and just being a humble chef of the people would be some good character resolution, but it would definitely feel like she's squandering her talent. <br><br>Then again, so is Souma's dad. And he still goes on little outings across the world every so often, so that could work too.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, the guy is a supreme douche with no sign of slowing his douchetrain down anytime soon, so there's that.</br>  <br>Report and ignore.</br>  <br><br>I thought Souma wanted to surpass his father? And Saiba is on top of the world (literally), serving VIPs and converting monks in NY with his god-tier cooking. I don't see Souma returning to the family restaurant anytime soon, he's too ambitious for that.<br><br>Even if he does, Erina would probably be dere enough to follow him there.  Her backstory in the LN says she's always wanted to see the outside world and is often bored being surrounded by beautiful things all the fucking time. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Megumi carries the hopes and dreams of her town. She is the heir to her mom's ryoukan at the center of her little town.<br><br>No, whoever ends up with Megumi will have to go there and run her inn. She won't abandon her community. She's attending tootsuki for all of them.</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry anon, you asked for it.</br>  <br>Ryoko's got decent taste. I'm terrified Shun's not going to make it, though.</br>  <br>That looks nothing like her.<br><br><br>Judging from pixiv and toranoana, C88 will see quite an increase in SnS doujins. It's a pity the Leonora being orgied by the three Autumn finalists was just a single image, though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>When it's the main character sure, as you are obviously supposed to root for them, but that doesn't apply so much to tertiary characters.<br><br>Although for me it's sort of like how I hate Superman. Characters that are just born with godly abilities are boring and dumb, characters like Souma that are evidently pretty average talent wise, if Jouichiro is correct, but work their asses off to become good, are far more endearing.</br></br></br>  <br>It's funny how half the tripe in that post weren't even true.</br>  <br>Stop it, anon. Alice already has Ryou.</br>  <br>Probably first, I mean come on this are the top 2 best and a top 8.</br>  <br><br>Then I'll give you some<br><br><br><br>Yea, reread the thread, Hisakofags are really smart people, not sarcasm, I swear.<br><br><br>At least cut the other side, to put her out of her misery<br><br>Can Erina live without her Nakirimandibles ?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> AliceXRyouXSpice threesome doujins when? </br>  <br> Can Erina live without her Nakirimandibles ? <br>Of course not that's her trademark hairstyle.</br></br>  <br>For me he just isn't a very interesting character. And I did expect him to trump Hisako but what he said to her afterwards was mean and petty, even if it was true.<br><br><br> replying to it </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I would totally buy a love triangle between Alice, Hayama and Ryou if it was written with a humorous and not so serious take. Maybe have cute moments between them but at the end of the day, Alice is ultimately unaware that she's in a love triangle despite her being a tease. Have Hayama spill spaghetti and Ryou being whatever.<br><br>It could work as a comical one.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm hoping Aldinis keeps the first place, for a change.</br>  <br>But the thing is her settling down to run a little Family Restaurant does not fit her character at all. Especially if we're looking at it at her standpoint. She literally has a huge fucking status through her family and has a over confident attitude. She wouldn't drop all that to run a Family Restaurant. Soma's Dad is different though because he doesn't have a huge wealthy as family that's status is huge.<br><br>Also Soma doesn't seem like a type that would run a huge Restaurant business, but a small Family Restaurant. The person to win the Somabowl will be someone who accepts that. <br><br> Childhood friend ends up winning </br></br></br></br></br>    Is there no chapter this week, or is it just slow?  <br>I just want Ryou/Alice doujins that starts with rape and ends with vanilla.</br>  <br> She literally has a huge fucking status through her family and has a over confident attitude. She wouldn't drop all that to run a Family Restaurant <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ydf<wbr>H7iuLR0I</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Don't bite to that, it's clear that he is here to start shitty waifuwars. Hisakofags have never been that aggressive it's obvious that's just a falseflag.</br>  <br> We'll never know how Ibusaki smoked that French restaurant out of bankruptcy <br>Stagiare arc was best arc but they should've showed more of the other students' training.</br></br>  <br>They've got several days lead, so it's possible. On Souma's end, he obviously can't do anything about Kuga's total sales. Those have become ridiculous at this point.</br>  <br>http://www.jifengi.com/5646<br>Shit scans never etc.</br></br>  <br>I wonder if something like this might happen. I am wondering why the author mixed them up.</br>  <br>Raws have been out since Friday.<br>It's an actual cooking chapter with Yugi possibly about to get rekt.</br></br>  <br>The obvious route is that second years will just occupy vacant seats without changing the order, meaning Nene would be 1st seat.<br><br>But Isshiki has been built up to have hidden hotblooded streak, and will be an obstacle Souma must overcome. Thus, he shall take 1st seat.<br><br>Yugi and Eizan are just side monsters in this vidya game.</br></br></br></br></br>     Everyone bickering on who's going to win the Somabowl with Erina, Megumi, Hisako, and etc <br><br> Childhood friend ends up winning in the end <br><br>I wouldn't even get mad because so many people would be BTFO.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying once Erina falls in love she won't forget about her status as the god's tongue <br> implying she wouldn't use her status as the god's tongue to make yukihira more popular than ever before <br><br>You have a poor grasp of the way stories and characters develop</br></br></br></br>  <br> inb4 Alice just wanted Ryou to be friends with Hayama </br>  <br>Alice makes Hayama bearable, that's why.</br>  <br>Looks like they are setting it up for her to be with Erina in a lesbian relationship.</br>  <br>Wow, I didn't expect it to come with color pictures of the RL food, Morisaki sure works hard for this. Thank you anon.</br>  <br>He's so underutilized it makes me wonder why he's a character at all. I want to believe it's because he'll suddenly reveal himself as the Big Bad that Souma has to beat and just didn't pay any attention to until it was too late, but if it's going that route they're sure playing it close to the chest.</br>  <br>That works too.<br><br>This too.</br></br></br>  <br>You please the apostle of Erina</br>  <br>I will laugh so much if this happen.</br>  What are the odds that Souma doesn't win against Kuga in this arc? He'll sell enough to save himself from expulsion, but he also tastes defeat and retreats to lick his wounds while coming up with a new strategy.<br><br>The obvious development from this outcome would be him enlisting another Elite's help to improve himself and become truly Elite-tier. Erina is the most likely candidate he'll turn to, but I can also see Isshiki or another alumni stepping in. Or Momo, because she took 1st Place in the festival and hears about that crazy first-year who tried to take on Kuga. Maybe she'll come over curious and drop hints.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Doesn't Spice already have his senpai waifu?</br>    <br>Yeah, he'll most likely lose and use it as an opportunity to regroup and come back stronger.<br><br>Like how he wanted to get better after losing to Shinomiya</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but he completely sonzoned.</br>  Souma Chemistry Tier:<br><br>Top tier (hobbies and sense of humor in common):<br>Nao<br><br>High tier (respect both ways):<br>Megumi, Hisako<br><br>Mid tier (play well together):<br>Alice<br><br>Low tier (Cunt who fails him when he gave her a foodgasm):<br>Erina<br><br>Dead in the water tier (One sided love, the kiss of death):<br>Mayumi, Meat<br><br>Are you even trying tier:<br>other girls</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My dick is confused but erect anyway.</br>  <br>I mean looking at it logically, yeah only the nondescript mob character girl he knew before Tootsuki and we still know little to nothing about can win. Nakiri has her tremendous status, Megumi is going back to her home for her own thing, and Nikumi is the heiress to a meat conglomerate herself. Those are the top 3 girls that stand a chance, so if it isn't them, it is no one, which is not the kind of ending anyone reading this is after.</br>  <br>Add your post number under the "Are you even trying tier".</br>  <br>I feel like the day by day ranking system was introduced to let Souma somehow win the last day, though of course, he loses overall.</br>  <br><br>There is still a chance that he will lose. I am just not so sure that he is going to lose right after he had a training arc.</br></br>    <br>Meant that they are setting Hisako to be with Erina.</br>  <br>I concur with this listing, though I still think Megumi's going to win it.</br>  <br>Souma litteraly became his Father after the stagiaire arc, there's a retarded chance that he get on the level of a Elite Seat</br>  <br>You sure don't give up. I think you should try a different fanbase.</br>  <br>This.<br><br>I want Megumi to go for the Isshikibowl.</br></br></br>  <br>They would make a good couple.</br>  <br> Isshiki and Megumi get married <br> Isshiki shows up naked at the altar <br> All the regrets of megumi </br></br></br>  <br>Too bad Tsukuda is playing with Megumi x Isami</br>  <br>Interesting to consider, though to be honest I haven't seen anyone I'd consider worthy of Isshiki.</br>  Erina is best girl.<br><br>Albino cousin is shit.</br></br>  <br>&lt;Shokugeki no Souma is a cooking manga<br>If you want a romance manga you could read a romance manga.</br></br>  <br>I'd rather see him with Yuuki. He comes home from a hard day of work in the fields and Yuuki runs up to him in an apron squealing "I made dinner, praise me!"<br><br><br>Reported.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Isami has his childhood friend.</br>  <br>You have shit taste.</br>  <br>But it's an honest evaluation. And you flatter me, I jumped on the SnS rankings bandwagon but didn't start it.<br><br>Good image choice btw bro, Alice best girl</br></br></br>  <br> I made dinner, praise me! <br> She will never say that to you <br><br><br>Stop with all this waifuwar baiting, it's getting really annoying</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like both equally.</br>  What is Kurase's role anyway? Could she win a nonSoumabowl?  <br>But the author keeps talking about romance both in the story and out of the story anon-kun.<br><br>It's not our fault.</br></br></br>  <br>She is irrelevant</br>  <br> &lt; <br> &lt; <br>Except this is a romance manga<br><br>This became a romance manga in chapter 2</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> thinking she's anything but a device to be played against the protag <br>This is not the series for depth and heavy consideration for anything outside the food.</br></br>  <br> Stop with all this waifuwar baiting, it's getting really annoying <br>This, he should give up and move on already.</br></br>  <br> /thread</br>  <br><br><br>Most of the readers are male and the author is baiting them with a relationship between the protag and a hot as fuck female FOIL that will never happen. This is how it goes in series like this. Everything outside the main focus (food in this case) shouldn't be taken seriously.</br></br></br>  All girls are best girl.  <br>This is what I wish Tsukuda improves on. Both in stagiaire and festival arcs, he focuses only on Souma even though he has many secondary characters among which readers have found favorites. I think he should try to be less linear in the storytelling and show, actually show, other people's side story. That would make the manga longer too so more money for him. <br><br>So far he only shown glimpses of others with little payoff, like what is Megumi doing in the ryokan? Did Smoke manage to save his restaurant? What's the deal with buttbros? Same with the festival, we're almost at the fifth day but only Souma and Kuga's dishes have been shown. We get glimpses of Alice trio's trouble but not even shown their booth.<br><br>Tsukuda can capitalize on the characters he has made likeable, but he's not doing it enough.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's gone to festivals and stated that there will be a romantic ending.</br>  <br>especially takumi</br>  <br>I don't mind this outcome at all.</br>  I don't remember this. Is this from the novel?  <br>Sensei.<br><br>But she doesn't realize his feelings and sees him as a son.</br></br></br>  <br> His father basically says you'll reach your height when you cook for someone you love <br> Souma won't find a love because hurrr not a romance manga <br>Right, so it'll be some shitty ending where he never reaches his dads level, cool.</br></br></br>  <br>Have you not read the tourney arc? He develops a ton of characters there.</br>  <br>She's the forgotten childhood friend. The variant of the archetype that stays behind when the MC goes on a great adventure outside of their small world.<br><br><br><br>no, romance is a sub plot. And one that keeps to the background. Although sometimes people don't notice when it becomes relevant, like throughout the elections with Hayama and his "for Jun".<br><br><br><br>No, Souma actually is ending up with a girl. It's not a romance manga though, so it won't be the focus. The cooking and the competitions always will be.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Souma is going to drop out before graduating with Erina traveling around the world, after some years they will get married and set their family restaurant. Megumi will happily work with his husband in their  trattoria  who happens to be right across Souma's restaurant.<br>Hisako decides to support them and becomes an employer for them.<br><br>Hayama becomes a teacher in Totsuki and still hangs out with Alice and Ryo the former being a icon of the molecular gastronomy and Kurokiba just feels comfortable supporting her and being by her side.<br>Smoke and Marui, with their waifus, associate and create a famous restaurant who has the buttbros as their main and most importants chefs. The restaurant being supplied with natural ingredients from Yuuki's and Isshiki's farm.<br><br>Isami is back in Italy living a normally life with Bianca and occasionally helping his brother when he needs.<br>Don senpai finally made meat accept him and he is now living in luxury.<br><br>All of them being stalked with the powerful duo of gigganigga and Nao.<br><br><br>Trust me, I'm Tsukuda's cousin.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> romance <br> chapter 2 <br><br>Anon, I don't think you know what romance is. There was no romance displayed at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>lel this isn't yamada-kun and the 7 witches</br>  <br>I don't understand what you're arguing against. You said it yourself, the MC will end up with a girl, it's just a matter of when/who.</br>  <br>Isami is fine too, he's kind and gentle but not a pushover.</br>  <br> yamada-kun and the 7 witches <br><br> all girls good <br><br>The series with invisible witch Asuka. A genuinely unlikable person.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't you get range banned or something?<br><br><br> Marui <br> ever scoring <br>Other than that I like your scenarios.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Meat and Don. What a power couple.<br><br>All of this seems somewhat likely, good on you anon.</br></br></br>  <br> Takumi not ending with Meat <br>Their love for Souma and their jobber status will pair them up.</br></br>  <br>You should go back and read exactly what was said, in specifically what was said to Souma, in chapter 2.</br>  <br> Croque Monseur <br>No, it's an original recipe.</br></br>  <br>The problem with this one is that he never knew, and Bianca moved away. And then they moved away to Japan. Even if they fly back home between school years to visit their parents, she won't be there.</br>  <br>I think that would amuse the uncles from her village instead. Isshiki seems like the type who'd enjoy going home to the warmth of countryside family life after the occasional highbrow business trip.</br>  <br>I can't even imagine what Marui would be like if he actually got laid.</br>  Which of the relevant named characters can Megumi beat in a Shokugeki?<br><br>As far as I see it, just about everyone beats her.</br></br>  Will Ninjabro succeed in his mission?  Ruri is a miracle  Ruri is fusion  Ruri is kill.   mfw I realize Ninjabro actually has to do something in public in front of a huge crowd instead of working behind the scenes or jumping out of thin air <br>Oh man, this'll be something.</br>  EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENJOY!    <br>Nigga is it realisic for someone without any formal education to become a leading scientist? I don't give a shit if he is a engineering prodigy you still need a degree to be able to work as a Quantum Physicist/Engineer. It's like they just handed him the job to lead a team of scientist with more experience than him to create some band-aid program to fix the bad future. I call fucking bullshit.</br>  <br>He did that against Mieru and  FUCKING DESTROYED HER  so it looks good for Ninja. Except this time we'll actually get to see it.</br>  <br>It's cool man, I've conceded. It's a dumb character from a dumb show with a dumb premise. It's Yugioh. Logic never applies.</br>  <br> Tsuki's duel with Shinji is jsut starting <br> Shinji gets out his B-Force monsters or whatever he's using <br> Tsuki gets out Twilight Ninja Shingetsu, and goes to do something else <br> Meanwhile, Declan has somebody messing around in the broadcasting room or whatever <br> TV feed goes black <br> By the time it comes back, Tsuki has won decisively, and Shinji is pic related <br>What would your reaction be?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yugioh Zexal<br><br>Opponent:<br> well, I've wittled you down to your last fifty life points, etc, etc, unless you draw a card with the EXACT effect that can help these precise circumstances, looks like I'm winning this due-- <br><br>Protagonist:<br> I couldn't draw such a card, but I used my spooky outerspace powers to transform it into the exact one I need <br><br>Opponent:<br> FUCKING DAMNIT </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I know but when it comes to the everyday normal activities I cannot accept that they just went "Hey, you're parents were brilliant scientist that fucked up the city so bad that a good portion of it is underwater and the other a small island, would you help us with our work in this field you are not qualified to work in?" fucking happened. I swear 5D's triggers so much rage I had repressed for 4 years.</br>  <br> jsut <br> Declan <br>Jesus, am I retarded today or something?</br></br></br>    <br>The feed goes off either because Ninjabro shanked him, or he pulled some THE SEVENTH ONE shit.<br>Either way, I will hit the fucking ceiling.</br></br>  <br> Hey, you're parents were brilliant scientist that fucked up the city so bad <br>Zero Reverse wasnt Dr Yuseis fault, it was all Godwin and Yliaster</br></br>  <br>Not saying it isn't bullshit at all, in fact it's surely the most bullshit series out of the franchise. Even Zexal was more legitimate and subtle than this.</br>  <br>Shut up.</br>  <br>Daddy and Mommy Fudo were the ones who were in charge of the project. I'm sure Mommy Fudo went on maternity leave durring the final and testing stages of the momentum project but if anything that seemed abnormal, they should have shut that shit down before Ylliaster took control and made the Godwin brothers their puppets.</br>  <br>Everyone has a bad day, anon. That's just the radiation from the cancerous wiki getting to you. A thorough scrubbing will get rid of that.</br>  <br> Ninjabro fucks Shinji up <br> Crow develops a vendetta against the Lancers <br> Yuya ends up EGAOing the place, setting off Jack <br> The Synchroverse ultimately turns against Standard  <br> Academia bulldozes everybody </br></br></br></br></br>  YAMEROOOOOO    Reminder in the OP it shows Ninjabro in despair so maybe Shinji is a fusion pawn    <br>Nah dude, I thought the Shining Draws was a better way of doing it, in that there was an actual reason for miraculous topdecking. Only made better still thanks to Vector's priceless reactions.</br>  <br>Fucking shit no<br>I cannot handle sad ninjabro</br></br>  <br>It's okay, if Reira was kill he would simply commit Harakiri.</br>  <br> Harakiri <br>*Sudoku</br></br>  <br>He's a Ninja. Harakiri is a Samurai thing. Gongenzaka would do the Harakiri.</br>  <br>Is this the first time, those googles have actually served a legitimate function? Kinda reminds me of Team Taiyo.</br>  <br> You do the Harakiri   and you turn around, that's what it's all about </br>  <br> but if anything that seemed abnormal, they should have shut that shit down before <br>We have no indication that there was. Yliaster were time travelers, they had the benefit of knowing exactly how the project would proceed and where to interrupt it. Nobody with any sense could say that they could have reasonably prevented it</br></br>  <br> Is this the first time, those googles have actually served a legitimate function? <br>They covered his tears</br></br>   naruto references <br>really Konami?</br>  <br>Ino, Shikamaru and Choji also are in the public in one 5Ds or Arc V duel.</br>  <br>Sometimes i dont know if posts like these are serious</br>  <br> thinking this is a naruto reference </br>  <br>Pretty sure this isnt one of the serious ones, those tend to have more shitty grammar and run on sentences</br>  <br>low tier bait tbh</br>  <br> not knowing that InoShikaCho is based on Hanafuda </br>  <br>That's not how it works you little shit.<br><br><br>Do you even Hanafuda? That's one of the higher valued pairs which is called a a Yaku in the game of Koi Koi.</br></br></br></br>  This thing look awesome.<br>What anime cards do they still need to print?</br>  <br>sorry Ken-sama</br>  <br>I want this thing.</br>  <br><br>  He play Other card game than Duel Monster <br><br>Everyone laught at him !</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's even better in Yuma's duel with Vector<br><br>Vector:<br> Well, I've whittled you down to your last fifty life points, and you only have no cards left in your hand and only one single card left in your deck, and once you draw it my trap card will activate and defeat you. It is literally IMPOSSIBLE for you to win and- <br><br>Yuma:<br> I can't use this card so I'll just change it into something better. <br><br>Vector:<br> ... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure if that filename gave me cancer or not</br>  <br>Ignoring the fact Ylliaster were timetravers and were som illuminati tier organization, they knew the team who worked on the momentum project did regular analysis to see if any problem arose. When the problem got too bad that it would cause a large scale destruction and tried to shut it down it was too late. If they detected this shit earlier shit wouldn't have went down.</br>  <br>I think it was in GX.</br>  <br>It's in DM during Kaiba grandprix</br>  <br> Ignoring the fact Ylliaster were timetravers and were som illuminati tier organization <br>Why would you do that? It's a pretty important point<br><br> they knew the team who worked on the momentum project did regular analysis to see if any problem arose <br>They had crazy future tech and perfect knowledge of the Momentum project, it would have been easy for them to fabricate a problem beyond what current era science could detect. And Dr Fudo still managed to minimize the problem so all of Domino wasnt taken out</br></br></br></br></br>  How are these Vampire cards so far? Too shit? Too good? I'm gonna get them printed out and play with friends. They're just for fun.<br><br>Vampire Ardetha<br>Level 5 DARK Zombie-Type Ritual/Effect Monster<br>2000/1000<br>You can Ritual Summon this card with “Vampire Ritual.”<br>You can only use each of the (1) and (3) effects of “Vampire Ardetha” once per turn.<br>(1) If this card is Special Summoned: You can target 1 DARK “Vampire” monster in your Graveyard; Special Summon that target.<br>(2) When this card inflicts battle damage to your opponent: Declare 1 card type (Monster, Spell, or Trap); your opponent sends 1 card of that type from their Deck to the Graveyard.<br>(3) If this Ritual Summoned card is sent to the Graveyard: You can add 1 “Vampire” Spell/Trap Card from your Graveyard to your hand.<br><br>Vampire Elder<br>Level 10 DARK Zombie-Type Ritual/Effect Monster<br>3000/2000<br>You can Ritual Summon this card with “Vampire Ritual.”<br>You can only use the (2) effect of “Vampire Elder” once per turn.<br>(1) This card cannot be targeted by your opponent's card effects.<br>(2) You can discard 1 Zombie-Type monster; Special Summon 1 DARK “Vampire” monster from your Graveyard.<br>(3) If this Ritual Summoned card is sent to the Graveyard: Declare 1 card type (Monster, Spell, or Trap); your opponent sends 1 card of that type from their Deck to the Graveyard.<br><br>Vampire Ritual<br>Ritual Spell Card<br>This card can be used to Ritual Summon any “Vampire” Ritual Monster.<br>You can only use the (2) effect of “Vampire Ritual” once per turn.<br>(1) Ritual Summon 1 “Vampire” Ritual Monster from your hand, by Tributing other monsters from your hand and/or your side of the field whose total Levels equal the Level of the Ritual Monster you Ritual Summon.<br>(2) During your Main Phase, except the turn this card was sent to the Graveyard: You can banish this card from your Graveyard; 1 DARK “Vampire” monster you Normal Summon this turn can be Summoned without Tributing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why would you do that? It's a pretty important point <br><br>Because Ylliaster were never time travelers from the future fucking up the timeline. They used to be a Illuminati type cult but due to sexcults and executive meddling, we got time travelers from the future who have created many worlds and abandoned them.</br></br></br>  <br> They used to be a Illuminati type cult <br>We have no actual confirmation of what the role of Yliaster was meant to be before the all the shake ups. And either way it doesn't matter, it's canon whether you like it or not</br></br>  <br>What kind of deck are they supposed to be in?</br>  <br>Vampires, of course. Trying to give the deck more variety, but staying with the focus on the original Vampire Lord effect and Vampire Kingdom Field Spell.<br><br>I also have a massive hard-on for using all the summoning methods, so I'm also making 2 Vampire Synchro and Fusion monsters.</br></br></br>  <br>Best secondary character ever introduced, would cheer for.</br>  <br>Yes I know.

Now we don't even have lavalval chain to do targeted dumping<br>two) the absolute reliance on the normal summon<br>and three) lack of good tribute fodder<br><br>Something that searches out your vamps, something that gives you more normal summons, and something that can SS itself and act as a tribute. Stick both of the second two on the same monster, and you've got a winner. If you're fanatically opposed to misusing an archetype monster, make it unable to be used for XYZ material other than dark monsters, give it a terrible level or something.<br><br> Vampire Disciple <br> Level 1 <br> Dark/Zombie <br> 500/0 <br><br> If this card is in your graveyard, you can banish 1 other zombie-type monster from your graveyard; Special summon this card in face-up defense position. You can only use this effect of "Vampire Disciple" once per turn. During the turn this card is special summoned, you can normal summon 1 "Vampire" monster in addition to your normal summon/set.

Seriously niggers? Leo Institute of Dueling? They're gonna edit every occurance of LDS until the end of the show, I swear the editing team just ran out of work to do and told the higher ups it was necessary for whatever reason. Shuzo's dub voice is a crime and so is the changed pendulum BGM. <br><br>At least they gave the first mook an entertaining Terminator voice.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh no, not Suzu.<br>ZUZU</br></br>  <br>Everything about the dub other than the female voices is a crime, hell it's somehow worse than 4kids.</br>  <br> "I need your deck, your duel disk, and your duel runner." </br>  <br>Reminder that Yoko's voice is pure sex and when she goes full-banchou young boys everywhere will prematurely ejaculate and not know why.</br>  <br>They changed LDS because they don't want the Mormons suing them</br>  <br>I was planning on making a reworked Genesis Crisis that's searchable and not as bad to help with consistency, or maybe a variant of Covenant with the Hellgate / Tenki, along with a themed Lavalval Chain.<br><br>That Vampire Disciple is a really good idea. I usually used Mezuki to summon tribute fodder, but this is much better. And it can be made searchable. May as well make it a Tuner, too. Thanks anon, that will definitely make it better.<br><br><br>Yeah, I wanted to not go -2 with a Lv5 Ritual Summon. <br> Why not make it from deck to hand, so it's actually useful as a searcher? <br>I thought too much search power on it would be a bit too much. Vampire Sorcerer already does that and a lot of the time my Vampire Kingdoms get MST'd. Maybe I could give it a "from your deck to your hand" search and give a weaker Vampire the "from your graveyard to your hand" effect instead.<br><br>The mill is there to trigger Vampire Kingdom in case he does end up getting destroyed or even just sent to the graveyard. Could make my opponent more cautious.<br><br>Yeah, I wasn't sure if I wanted a copy of Sorcerer's effect or for it to grant an additional Normal Summon that turn.<br><br><br>I've never used those two in a Vampire deck. Or Tristan's wife. It's not like their defense is doing then any good, so may as well, I guess.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   There has been too much violence. Too much pain. But I have an honorable compromise. Just walk away. Give me your deck, the duel disk, the Ruris, and the whole dimension, and I'll spare your lives. Just walk away and we'll give you a safe passageway in the Academy. Just walk away and there will be an end to the horror.   <br> reiji's dad is brown <br> reiji is white <br>wat</br></br></br>  <br>He's tanned from standing in front of green radiation all day.</br>  <br>Don't question Lex Luthor.</br>  <br> Leo <br> Reiji's dad <br><br>I think you've got that mistaken</br></br></br></br>  <br>I was honestly surprised that they gave her such an arousing voice.</br>  <br> At least they gave the first mook an entertaining Terminator voice. <br>Dont forget about Yokos sex voice, I am totally going to watch the Motorbike Yoko dub episode</br></br>  <br>Reiji has a decent voice too from the trailers.</br>  Who wants to duel against the KINGU  <br>Why does Gon sound black?</br>  <br>The problem is that he could be vastly improved. Billy Bob also does Gon, which is shit because it has to be an Elvis impersonation, but he did voice Vector back in ZEXAL and was the only good VA during its entire run.<br><br>If they allowed Billy Bob to have a handle on Dennis, we'd be in a much better situation, but I guess they wanted to grab on to him sooner.</br></br></br>  <br> dueltaining </br>  <br>I agree he'd fit tons better as Dennis and I hate how they assume Gon is Elvis because of the hair, I think most people understand that hairstyle from Japan.</br>  <br>I think that the writers and directors forget that kids have internet which allows them to have a better grasp on the dub shows that are being put out. If they quit trying to Americanize everything these days, the show would be a much higher quality. It's one of the reasons Naruto did so well among middle-schoolers in the US.<br><br><br> swing into action </br></br></br></br>  Is the Manzai out already?  <br> Akaba Reiji  <br> Father: Akaba Leo  <br>U wot</br></br></br>  <br>He's implying Nakajima banged Himika.</br>  <br>I don't even understand some of the changes honestly. It's been awhile since I've watched the first episode, but the Pendulum scene seemed chopped up to hell and back in the dub, and for what reason, I have no idea. They just need to stop shit like this.<br><br>When you have to pull YGO from 4kids because it's bringing down your business and then shit out a product that is somehow worse, you're doing something wrong.</br></br></br>  <br>Gon said he promised his father he would never stop Steadfast Dueling, and then Yuya reminded him that Riding Duels require him to move. Gon cried.</br>  <br>Why do they insist on changing the music?<br><br>That whole licensing shit isn't as serious as it was 20+ years ago. What's the point?</br></br></br>  <br>don't some former 4kids employe work the the YGO anime lolcalisation division of konami now?</br>  <br>Anything made by the Japanese is filthy because Pearl Harbor, so everything must be done properly by the good ol' Americans.

Does that make it possible to summon Odd Vortex and Rune eyes in a performapal deck without having to run Polymerization in the deck? I've tried using trump witch but most of the time, I never have Odd Eyes out And have empty scales to slap Trump witch in to fusion summon.  Why is Yuya such a jobber. This guy loses all the time it matters. He shouldn't be jobbing at this stage of the game if you ask me.  <br>If you want to see a MC who never lose, go watch zexalshit.</br>  <br><br>That's wrong. If you want an MC that never loses go watch 5D's. Or DM.</br></br>  <br>Run some sky arcs in your deck for the odd eyes search and use odd-eyes fusion, it's way better.</br>  <br>The card basically does the same thing as Mammoth Splash does. Only that it can only use pendulum monsters as material, but isn't restricted to dragon fusions.</br>  <br>I just want a balance. Like fuck he shouldn't have jobbed as hard as he did to Jack. If Yuya had to lose then he should have lost after the 3rd turn of Jack. Like had Yuya pull some crazy shit that surprises the King and made him like this motherfucker and THEN have Jack win but make Jack work for it. Then in the last battle between Yuya and Jack it gets interrupted by the invasion and it's not resolved. Then later have Jack job to Yuri and have him be like you are the ONE.</br>  <br>Yes but it really depends on your hand. If not at least it's Red Resonator bait along with being an okay beater.<br><br>I'm always wanting to go into Scar-right so I never thought of that actually.<br><br>None of the manga Red Dragons other than Hot Red seriously interest me. But I like Abyss' artwork.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Jack jobbing to anyone in Arc-V <br><br>I can't take you seriously, I mean, Yuya really jobbed hard against Reiji (who I believe wasn't even serious because he wanted to see OERD) and you want to see him, 2-3 days later, being a threat to the KINGU? I mean come on mate.</br></br></br>    <br>Meshi vs Steadfast, who will win?</br>  <br> Gongenzaka lost!? </br>  <br>My heart says Steadfast, but my brain tells me Meshi.</br>  <br>Of course Fudo no duel will win</br>  <br>So he will lose since he's moving in a bike?</br>  <br>probably better for Gon to lose right off the bat, he's tough enough to take care of himself and maybe any other losers, so whatever happnens after losing may not be so bad</br>  <br>He wasn't exactly in his prime state.<br>We don't even know how strong EGAOmode is supposed to be.</br></br>  <br>No, he'll lose because Konami doesn't want to trigger the Crow fanboys, you know, the ones that don't exist.</br>  <br>His feet aren't moving, and his ass is in one place. It's like dueling while on top of a very small very fast train. Technically he's not moving, the vehicle is moving beneath him.</br>  IT'S CRUNCH TIME<br><br>PLACE YOUR FINAL BETS<br><br>http://strawpoll.me/5018408</br></br></br></br>  <br>Strawpolls are for gays</br>  <br>This is probably the most hype I've been for a duel since Yuya and Reiji's rematch</br>  <br> final bets <br> it's a two prater  <br>bit early don't you think?</br></br></br>  This is what will happen<br> Gongenzaka will be on the verge of losing <br> Out of nowhere the ghost of jesus fudo will tell Gongenzaka the true meaning of Fudo no duel <br> Gongenzaka goes ACCEL SYNCHRO </br></br></br>  <br>I don't think anybody cares about these two characters enough to need to bet on it.</br>  <br> Not lack-of-accel synchro </br>  <br> two parter <br><br>It's not. The next episode is Shinji VS Tsukikage.</br></br></br>  <br>Same here. I guess it's because we honestly don't know who's going to win.</br>  <br>nothing has topped Yuya vs Sora for me, that shit was great</br>  <br>Accel Synchro isn't that impressive.</br>  <br>really? I was sure I read somewhere that it would be a two parter</br>  <br>Yea because it's outclassed by rank 4 xyz</br>  <br>Maybe it's resolved at the start of the next episode.</br>  <br>I wouldn't go that far, Rank 4 is the most pleb Rank out of all XYZ. Accel is meh, but it isn't THAT bad.</br>   yfw the duel ends with   another tie   <br> yfw the duel ends with   Gon falling off his bike and dying </br>  Will the Executive Council even care if Crow or Gongenzaka lose if they are the reasons the crowd gets pumped?  <br>If Reira dies I will shit myself in public</br>  <br>You don't have to, anon, Tsukikage will do everything to protect him.</br>  <br>they seems sinister to me, like this is all a game to them and they expect everyone to lose cause whoever wins will have to duel Jack, and nobody beats Jack</br>  <br> Dennis defeats Jack <br> Uses the moment to proclaim the full strength of the Fusion empire </br></br>  <br>Isn't that right, gicho?</br>  <br>You seem to have forgotten Jack jobbed many many times.</br>  <br>Him obliterating Yuya is revenge for being a crash test dummy for the majority of 5D's.</br>  Holy shit Abyss is fucking amazing  <br>He jobbed so many times in 5D's they had to bring him in to Arc V to bully the newcomers.</br>  <br>Hai</br>  <br>Oi.</br>  <br>Eh, not really. One trick ponies belong on .<br><br><br>Nice eyebrows</br></br></br></br>  Holy shit this was better than I was hoping for. Almost makes me sad we'll never see him after Synchro is over.  <br>I think they're giving him enough spotlight right now that he might join the Lancers</br>  <br>Fuck you, Chojiro is the best thing to come out of Arc-V that can't be put into lewds. Chojiro deserves to stay with the show until the very end.<br><br>Fuck, I'm a grown-ass man and I still watch the Chojiro duel so I can yell, "ENJOY!!" at my computer screen.</br></br></br>  <br>I think he'll be asked and agree to help the lancers, we'll then see him fight academia, but probably only ancient gear fodder</br>  <br>But he's not a part of the Sawatari generation</br>  It has been one year since Shun made his silent debut.<br>And in a month, it will be the anniversary of this</br>  <br>I don't get people who say this. Why would he not join the Lancers? Currently ENJOY, Crow, Crow's gang, Jack, and Sam are the only people they've met in Synchroverse that have been given attention. The whole reason for visiting Synchroverse in the first place was to gain allies, so going and then leaving without allies is retarded.</br>  <br>One year since imoutoman changed my life forever.</br>  Arc V nendoroids would be the cutest shit ever, fuck the lack of YGO figures.  <br>You know what else isn't very impressive? Yusei's Turbo,Road and Nitro Warriors. Turbo warrior may of been good back in the day when everybody ran synchro monsters, Road Warrior is too slow and Nitro Warrior is fuck dame pointless. I wish Sherry would of given him a copy of her knight card, negating a spell or trap is far more useful than anyone of those three cards.</br>  <br>Oh they'll be allies alright. Stationed in Synchro, that is. You don't expect Reiji and co. to lug them around the dimensions with them do you? They'll be preparing all the duelists they can for either an Academia invasion or for a siege on Academia, although if the rumours that Fusion is invading during the Friendship Cup are true, then a couple of people on that list is going to get carded.</br>  <br>Because he's an adult,anon. When's the last time an adult got to be useful in a fucking kids anime?</br>  <br>It's really been a year? Shit, happy belated birthday, Imouto-Man.</br>  <br> You don't expect Reiji and co. to lug them around the dimensions with them do you? They'll be preparing all the duelists they can for either an Academia invasion or for a siege on Academia <br>The plan was to gain allies to attack Academia. If Reiji wanted them to stay and fight in their dimensions, he could have just told the council to do just that and the Lancers participating in the tournament wouldn't have to be done.</br></br>   Look at these commoners, look at them and LAUGH!    Reiji vs. Jack <br> Reiji wins <br>What happens to the Lancers?</br></br>  <br>That can easily be achieved by giving them interdimensional teleporters with the coordinates of Academia. Reiji has all the technology anyway.</br>  <br> already been a year <br>What the fuck?

The thing is that because they set the anime in nowadays her delinquent personality was seriously out of place. Well, to resolve this they did the most retarded thing they could - they removed her personality traits and didn't provide anything else.
