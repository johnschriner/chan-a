Not only that, but I also want her to show the girls their sex tape when they get together one time.<br>Their sex tape would be one of the most genuine with the most amount of sexual frustration and sexual debauchery:<br><br>(1/3)<br><br> Haruno begins by giving 8man the most amazing foreplay of his pathetic life. She starts by roughly pushing 8man to the wall of their room and then proceeds to whisper nothing but dirty talk into his ear while gently stroking his hachi through his pants. She progresses to a long session of deep kissing by sucking on his tongue and uses their saliva as lubricant to further indulge in their passion for each other. <br><br> 8man breaks and he wants to be the more dominant of the two, but Haruno only reacts by pushing him to the bed and mischievously states that she will the dominant one in here. <br><br> They continue to kiss each other, but now that Haruno is on top of him, 8man feels the greater stimulus of her boobs pressing against his chest with all her weight on him. With 8man's genuine rod roaring to be released, Haruno unzips his pants and unleash the 8incher in all its glory. <br><br> She gently teases his dick with an impish smile and then kisses the tip while stroking his shaft with both hands. She moves on to using her tongue all over his shaft in a manner analogous to sealing a mail letter. Finally, Haruno deepthroats the 8incher in one go while looking at him the whole time with a naughty expression. 8man, unable to resist Haruno' playfulness, announces that he is about to cum, however, he is only met with Haruno grabbing him by his balls and saying, "not yet, not before I get to feel good with this 8incher inside of me". </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>(2/3)<br><br> Haruno then takes her completely soaked panties off and makes 8man sniff them and lick them while she watches his throbbing cock scream for physical contact. She watches 8man’s expression in awe and realizes that he is completely enveloped in the stimulus brought upon by her panties. She teasingly laughs and gets excited to see his cock jumping from the anticipation of physical contact. <br><br> Shortly after, she straddles his dick with her pussy and uses his precum and her own juices as lubricant to comfortably take the 8incher. After making sure that it's lubricated enough, she rides the 8incher while she whispering how big his dick is and how good it feels. Those whispers then turn to gently bites on his ear and quickly proceed to rough hickeys throughout his neck and upper chest. Haruno and 8man orgasm at the same time and they just deeply stare into each other’s eyes without saying a word; they take a moment to enjoy the pleasure of their drug-like induced orgasm. <br><br> After coming back to reality, 8man falls on Haruno’s chest and she praises 8man by telling him how she loves his thick and warm loads. <br><br> 8man gets hard again and finally finds an opportunity to be the dominant one. 8man switches spots with her and gets on top of her. He forcibly grab her by both of her wrists and Haruno's only reply to this turn of events is: "did I finally break you to the point where I actually feel like being the submissive one?" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>(3/3)<br><br> 8man’s animalistic instincts materialize and he tongue fucks her again while he penetrates deeply inside of her. Haruno’s answer to this new position does not come through words but by body language and body fluids. Her body convulses like never before and she squirts all over the bed making it look as if a small child wet their bed sheets. Haruno comes back to her senses, but is unable to make a single coherent sentence. 8man proceeds to shut her gibberish by caressing her slender throat in one hand while grabbing her wet tongue with the other. <br><br> After she stops having her wild orgasms, 8man starts thrusting his dick with slow, long strokes back into her pussy; Haruno comes again in no time due to her sensitivity. 8man stops for a couple of seconds and is quickly ready for another round. However, Haruno tries to get away from 8man by pushing him off and tries to crawl away from him to rest for a bit. <br><br> 8man's swiftly grabs Haruno’s weak calves and roughly pulls her closer to him. He puts Haruno on a rear naked choke while whispering how good it feels inside of her. Haruno is unable to do anything besides biting the bed sheets mix her and 8man’s fluids. 8man continues to fuck her until the both of them orgasm again. <br><br> After their long session, both of them are stare at the ceiling in a trance-like manner and they enjoy the pleasure of their debauchery while breathing heavy. Haruno then rests her head on his shoulder and whispers how much of a monster he was tonight. She jokingly states that he is no longer a monster of logic, but a monster of sex. <br><br> Both of them fall asleep and try to recharge their energy and restore their body fluids for tomorrow's morning sex. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  Did anyone save the Haruno fic someone wrote before, where it included her taking a pic with 8man and posting it on her social media  <br><br><br>It is hard to keep my boner contained. Truly, you are aware of the inevitable ending. Praise to you, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>lol that was weeks back. Some bored anon would probably find it though.</br>  <br><br><br><br>And the screen pans to the YYx2 whom have been watching the whole tape in tears and lust, and then goes and drowns themselves right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hayato is in the same room.<br><br>Watching and waiting for a chance to intervene that never cums.</br></br></br>  <br>Hayato would definitely be into it.</br>  <br> Imouto alliance on the lead <br><br>Nice taste</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;1287272299 <br>Who drew this? Reverse search gives me nothing.</br>  <br>Something along those lines. I will finish writing their conclusion later but that's the gist of it.</br>  <br><br>This was the only thing I found:<br><br> The gardens were green and full of flowers. There were stone steps and bamboo walls that resembled the gardens in the old capital like some forgotten temple for blown off course onto Chiba. <br><br> Yukinoshita Haruno led the way. <br><br> It was only now, following her brisk short steps, that I noticed what she was wearing. Elegant and colorful, with a cool blue kimono that appeared a softer shade in the moonlight. Her hair was bound up, and being behind her I was given an exquisite view of her pale nape. <br><br> For a while, we said nothing. Then we turned a corner. <br><br> In an instant, she pulled me close, the distance between our lips were nearly zero. <br><br> I'll admit, for a moment my heart fluttered. <br><br> "You know Hikigaya-kun… when a girl asks a man to be alone with him… there are always other motives." Her breath was sweet. Her skin was smooth, and without pores. It looked ethereal in the pale moonlight. <br><br> I gulped. <br><br> Her hand was pressed against my chest. The scent of her air was causing my mind to wander. <br><br> Flash. <br><br> Huh? What? <br><br> "Oh wow! This is a great picture!" Haruno-san giggled to herself. In her free hand, she held her phone that now possessed a picture of myself and her. If anyone else saw it without the proper context they'd definitely get the wrong idea. <br><br> "H-hey now…" <br><br> "Wow! This is going to go on my Twitter…" <br><br> "That's a bit much… no…" I tried reaching for her phone. I just wanted to hold onto it long enough to delete it. <br><br> "There, there, don't be such a prude," Haruno-san smiled. "Aren't men supposed to be happy they are taking pictures with lovely women? Or perhaps you aren't into women…? Or maybe you think I'm an old onee-chan that's too withered for you, eh? Eh?" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The self-deprecating humor suited her as the flower patterns on her bosom blossomed with each jest. It appeared that Haruno-san was a master of masks, able to take any form she so desired or needed. The garden was her natural habitat, full of tall grass and plants, that hides the viper that is her beneath. <br><br> "I just think people might get the wrong idea here…" I said looking around, worried I was getting caught up in her rhythm. If things continued at this pace, I think the situation could become irreversible. <br><br> The woman didn't pay attention to me as she fiddled with her phone. <br><br> "Voila! Uploaded! I'm going to be Twitter famous," Haruno-san giggled to herself. "Aren't you excited Hikigaya-kun? You'll be known as the latest and only in my list of lovers…" <br><br> "Latest… wait, only? Does that mean you've never-?" <br><br> A finger silenced my lips. <br><br> "Feel special now, don't you?" She tucked the phone away into her carry-on bag and walked away to the beat of her own drum. She was happy. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Thanks anon.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>my dick<br><br> making it look as if a small child wet their bed sheets <br>best line</br></br></br></br></br></br>  See this<br>What do?</br>  <br> Yo'sup <br>and then I walk back out to go find best girl</br></br>  <br> walk back out to go find best girl <br>But then you'd go outside, immediately turn around and go back inside. That seems rather redundant if you ask me.</br></br>  <br>What if Hayato is actually the protagonist of a NTR series, and 8man has been the villain all of this time? Do we root for evil?</br>  <br>It's not evil if Hayato enjoys getting cucked.</br>  <br><br>Fall to my fucking knees.<br><br>I live to serve you, best Yukinoshita.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>  Years later, Hayato finally asks Iroha for her hand in marriage.  <br><br>  Iroha accepts.  <br><br>  Cue camera to a typical wedding scene. We see people from 2-F, including a Yumiko holding in her tears.  <br><br>  We see Iroha giving birth to a boy in the hospital with Hayato with his dumbass smile. <br><br>  Two years later, we're at the Hayama mansion. <br><br>  "Iroha, you're going out? Don't worry, I'll take care of our son. Say hi to Yukino, Yuigahama, and Hikigaya for me." <br><br>  "Thanks! You're the best husband and father. Will do." <br><br>  Hayato monologue time. Hmm, I'm glad I took time off from work so Iroha has been going out to socialize lately. She's been really down last year, and I don't like that she has been taking all of those depression pills. <br><br>  Minutes later. What's this? Iroha left her phone. Better call Yukino and let her know. <br><br>  "Hey Yukino? It's me, Hayato. Can you let me know when Iroha's done hanging out with you guys? I'll pick her up with my car." <br><br>  "Huh? Iroha-san? I haven't seen her since the baby shower." <br><br> "W--what? But hasn't she been hanging out with the old Service Club gang? Hikigaya-kun dropped her off home a few times." <br><br>  A fuck ton of flashbacks. <br><br>  Looks at his son. Notices his hair has been growing pretty fast. Might need a haircut. Wait a second... <br><br>  Has an ahege. <br><br> Haven't done one of these in a while. Sorry if it sucks. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Irohafags are NTRfags <br>shit taste confirmed</br></br>  <br> Iroha and Komachi on the top 2 <br>Surprisingly good taste in this fanbase.</br></br>  <br>Saika without doubt</br>  <br><br>komachi a perfect</br></br>  <br>Your first line had me vomiting.<br>By the end I was still gagging but I still don't know what to make of it.</br></br>  <br>Why are you even bother when the Irohafag is going to proxy the poll anyway</br>    <br>KomachIroha a best girls</br>  <br>Now this is rich.<br>You can't even accept that people like Iroha.</br></br>  Every thread until I'm bored.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8<wbr>HNDM-jsI</wbr>  [ ] <br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm264<wbr>84384<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PNK<wbr>sCa9Pwgg</wbr>  [ ] <br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm220<wbr>75326<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3QZ<wbr>7x1t2iB4</wbr>  [ ] <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lij<wbr>swIzQC9c</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Jej<wbr>Myfs5K0E</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> http://animaru.jp/shop/e/eoregaiu/<wbr></wbr> <br> Saika's daki sold out before YY does  <br><br>YYfags BTFO</br></br></br></br>  OTP  <br>Saika's daki is a limited release.</br>  <br>OTP</br>  <br> 数量に限りがあります。 <br> There is a limited quantity. <br>Sorry your waifu didn't even warrant a limited run daki, Irohafag.</br></br></br>  <br>It's limited, retard<br>Typical Irohafag<br> inb4 &gt;falseflagging this hard </br></br></br>  <br>That's not Zaimokuza</br>  <br>OTP</br>  OTP  <br>Megu Megu Megurin Megurin~ Power!</br>  <br><br>a best<br><br>A BEST</br></br></br></br>  <br>Truly the greatest miracle of this series.</br>  <br><br><br>Meguri-senpai will always be in our hearts!</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> tfw 8man isn't into older girls <br> blatantly ignores his cute as fuck senpai instead of going after her <br>you fucked up 8man</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>she deserves happiness (not the cunt)</br>  <br>They should have done more with her ruined makeup.<br>She looks nothing like a panda here.</br></br>  <br>It's alright, anon. 8man just has shittaste.</br>      <br>I like the first one, the others are mediocre at best.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br> all these OTPs <br> none are the only true OTP <br>I am disappointed</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off Yuckynofag.</br>  <br>You got the wrong Yukinoshita, anon.</br>  Does anyone actually like Yukino?

This would be the girls’ conclusion to watching the tape:<br><br>The tape ends, but instead of a black screen they are met with a picture of Haruno’s smug face. The three girls are left speechless. Yui’s and Yukino’s face depict nothing but absolute horror; it’s as if they just witnessed the most horrific live murder ever shown to humankind. Iroha’s face demonstrates admiration and jealously, but she diligently takes notes of 8man’s sexual likes.<br><br>Haruno thanks them for watching something so dear to her and proceeds to tell them that she has to go because she is running late to her date with 8man. She explains how frustrated the both of them have been because they have not been able to see each other due to Haruno’s busy life with her family.<br><br>As she says her goodbyes, Yukino tries to stand up to stop her from her rendezvous with 8man but her knees are too weak (for multiple reasons) and she falls to the floor. Haruno leaves and the girls are left dumbstruck.<br><br>After calming down, Yukino and Yui get their 8man facemask and find the biggest cucumber in their fridge and use it as a strap-on. Meanwhile, Iroha practices the kisses that she saw in the sex tape with double YY and they have the most explosive sex while screaming their respective nicknames for 8man.<br><br> I wish I could edit my posts, I had a lot of stupid grammar mistakes in the fanfic </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Glasses Yukino &gt; Twintail Yukino &gt; Shitty Normal Yukino</br></br>  <br> my love comedy is wrong as expected <br><br> False <br><br>Am I the only one who has noticed this?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, nobody else in the history of the world noticed it.</br>  <br>It was only wrong in the beginning because he made it go another direction.</br>  <br> http://strawpoll.me/5057196 <br><br>Hahahahaha!

For some reason, Yuigahama was the one who took it. <br><br> “I-I’ll do it for you!” She started digging out rice from the wooden container with gusto, humming as if she thought this was all fun and games. “Here you go!” <br><br> Oh wow. She whipped me a mountain of rice that wouldn’t look out of place in a Japanese folklore tale. Well, whatever. I was thinking of eating another serving, so I wasn’t complaining. “Thanks…” <br><br> With great solemnity, I let the bowl fall on my wrists and held it over my head in worship. Only then did I start eating a second time. <br><br> But (surprise, surprise!) this time the rice was damn good. <br><br>Just what kind of poison did Yui put in 8man's rice bowl?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Just fuck already, it's clear to everyone that you're both tsundere for eachother.</br></br>  <br>She tried to slip in some pseudo love potion.<br><br>Real answer: <br>His previous bowl had natto, seaweed flavouring and a raw egg.<br>He didn't like it so plain rice was better.</br></br> </br></br></br>  <br>Oh man, it's been a while since I last went there since I don't need the TLs either.<br>Seems like he changed the layout, huh.

They strike me as the type of people that get triggered by NTR threads and shitpost on them, read vanilla exclusively and behave like insecure cucks that always go for the most beta girl since in their mind such a character is the only one capable of "pure" love.<br>This is merely a hypothesis, mind you.</br></br>  <br>Shiromeguri and Ebina needs more love.</br>  <br>Megurin is too pure for this threads.</br>  <br>She has a decent reason to be a bitch to YY2.<br>She's very insecure and has abandonment issues.<br><br>She hates Yukino because she has a history with Hayama she doesn't know the details of.<br>She's afraid of Hayama being taken away from her.<br><br>She finds out Yui started skipping out on their girl time to go spend time with Yukino.<br>She's afraid of Yui being taken away from her.<br><br>She knew Yui was going to have lunch with Yukino, but couldn't outright state her insecurities.<br>So she decided to stall and play dumb, but came off bitchy.<br><br>She tried to get along with the service club by playing tennis with them, when Yukino wasn't there.<br>They didn't let her join in on their reindeer games, so she had to try to force her way in.<br>She even offered to practice with Saika, if she won.<br>She never said that she wouldn't let them help out too.<br><br>Also putting Haruno at the bottom clearly shows you need their character and intentions spelled out for you to appreciate them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My problem with Haruno is that she needs to fuck off, or in less edgy terms, stop fucking with high school kids too much. I get it, she's a worried Onee-san that cares about her imouto, and is going 8man style about it. Why the need to treat people like her personal clowns?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128740813 <br>Oh also, about Miura; being a cuntblocker to Iroha without making moves on the cunt and mocking Saki without knowing why she even wanted to make chocolates.</br>  <br>I smell an NTRfag pretending he's better than anybody.</br>  <br>I have a theory Haruno didn't actually start fucking with Yukino like that until she met 8man; she used to lightly tease her like during the mall date.<br><br>She sees how much 8man can get shit done by being an asshat, during the Culture Festival. She also knows 8man has gotten closer to Yukino than she has in years, so she tries to emulate him.<br><br>She becomes the villain in 8man's stead because she doesn't want Yukino to lose her friends. She even tries to brace Yui for her eventual jealousy and make her keep in mind to make choices where Yui wouldn't hurt herself or Yukino too badly.<br><br>8man and Shizuka are the only ones who understand what she's doing, but don't really accept her methods either.<br><br>I'm going to go through the LN's again for various other reasons, but I want to confirm her character development.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I have a theory Haruno didn't actually start fucking with Yukino like that until she met 8man <br>Problem is we've had at least a couple scenes in 9 and 10 that indicate Haruno has always been a terror to Yukino, and probably Hayama to a lesser extent.</br></br>  <br><br> Nice first experiences that totally happened during elementary school. <br><br>They are still first experiences. First crush, first time holding hands with a boy, first time kissing a boy. Age does not change a thing.<br><br> More like didn't bother to stand up for her so she decided to do it herself by becoming better than everyone else. <br><br>More like the rejection fucked with her so much that she developed an inferiority complex and always tried to match her sister in order to make the cunt like her.<br><br> She was cold towards Yui during this part because Yui was being a slut talking about how embarrassing it is to be a virgin while Yukino says placing importance on losing it is completely stupid. <br><br>Of course Yukino says that it's stupid, she can't relate to it.<br><br> She gave those exact same chocolates to Haruno before starting grade school. <br><br>I'm assuming you are not a retard and that you have heard of double standards before, right? Giving chocolates to your dear older sister and to a boy, who also happens to be your crush, and the same age as you is not the same thing.<br><br>Instead of insulting Yui and making a fool out of yourself, you should probably read what you type before posting. Besides, the fact that she is concerned about being a virgin and how embarrass she gets when she talks about it just further emphasizes her innocence, especially when she is still a virgin albeit the fact that she could literally pick any guy from the school (besides 8man) to lose her virginity with. <br><br>I know that realizing that your waifu is beyond used goods is a hard pill to swallow, but you have to accept it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> giving chocolate when you're 3 makes you beyond used goods <br>This is what Irohafags actually believe</br></br>  <br><br> age doesn't matter <br><br>not even that guy but you know there's reason why you're more held liable for the choices you make as an adult right? same logic here, she isn't even as matured nor has experience anything before.<br><br>as for your other points, they all revolve around baseless assumptions. <br><br> she can't relate to it <br>are you serious? she said it's normal to be a virgin at their age, not that I have anything against Yui but she was literally the only one making a big deal out of it. she calls it stupid because she thinks it's trivial.<br><br><br> double standards <br>calm down pre-edgelord 8man, stop misinterpreting kindness for flirting<br><br> tried to match her sister in order to make the cunt like her <br><br>are you serious? is that why she has never showed any heed to him throughout the novel?<br><br>obvious bait is obvious but i'll bite anyway</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's also pretty ironic since Iroha gave chocolate to Hayama before she gave them to 8man too<br><br>Who knows how many countless guys got chocolate from her before</br></br></br>  <br>She and Yumiko forced Hayama to try their chocolates, so technically neither have given him chocolates on V-day that we know of yet.<br>He'd have turned them down, he said he never accepts chocolates <br> anymore because Yukino put her blood, spit, and pubes in the chocolates she gave to him years ago to make him fall in love with her <br><br>She let 8man try the chocolates first.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 3-5 year old <br> pubes <br>What?</br></br></br>  <br> pubes  <br> 3 years old <br>Trying too hard?</br></br></br>  <br>We literally saw Hayama eat the chocolate retard, of course he had it<br>Also<br> pubes </br></br></br>  <br>Obligatory <br> pubes </br></br>  <br>Unrelated question, but did you have pubes at 3 years old? Because that's pretty fucking weird anon</br>  <br><br>Japanese elementary schools start at 6-7 ends at 11-12.<br>12yo with pubes aint impossible.<br><br><br><br>She spoonfed 8man first.<br>Then she made Hayama try some.<br><br>And yes he did eat it during the chocolate making event, I said we don't know if they actually tried giving him chocolates on Valentines day itself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except she was 3 when she gave them the chocolates.</br>  Reading the school festival arc, where did Yukino get the same shirt as Yui from?<br>Weren't the orange shirts only for their class?</br>  <br>She took the one meant for 8man, his name wasn't on the list of classmates anyways, so it's not like he actually wanted it or anything ;_; </br>  <br><br>His name was on it but the shirt had a list of the nicknames the class called each other.<br>Hachiman's only had HIkigaya-kun written on it.<br><br>Also relevant.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> like matching clothes worn by couples <br>8man you flirt</br></br>  <br><br>a cute! A FUCKING CUTE!</br></br>  <br>Hold on there Satan, did Hikki even get the shirt back  or did Yukino keep it? </br>  <br>My bad I thought Hayama said she gave him chocolates before chugakko not shogakko.<br><br><br>Satan why must you make me more sad for 8man.<br><br>Forced to do Culture Festival Rep, when he was supposed to be casted as the Prince.<br>Some other useless faggot in his class could have gone in his stead.<br>Doesn't even get Hikki, Hikitani, or Hikio on his shirt.<br>Doesn't even get to have his shirt.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Isshiki and Saika <br>Fixed that for you. 8man knows better than to stick his dick in crazy.</br></br>  <br> The Pan-san she gave him <br> 8man's class T-shirt <br> The roller coaster picture <br> The Pan-san cup he gave her in Destinyland <br> The Pink Scrunchie <br> The PC glasses <br><br>I bet she keeps them all in a box under her bed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its pretty cute that Hachiman have given her directly or indirectly all these things<br><br>Last thing he needs to give her is his heart.

year's and ask around the classrooms to find him before he left campus. <br> He tells her he's a free man and has no obligations to speak to her. <br> Iroha breaks into tears and rambles on about how Yui is being sulky and trying to get her to go out and eat lots of icecream(Iroha can't go out unless someone else is treating her and Yui is not a desperate boy) <br> His onii-chan instincts kick in, he devises a plan to pretend to go on a date with Iroha and act all affectionate to make Yui leave the club(A skill he uses quite often, when he goes out with Komachi to ward off boys) <br> Insert

entire time?</br>  <br> Yui calls him stupid and gross and then runs home with Sable <br><br> Komachi gives them a blank stare <br> Komachi pulls his arm off Iroha, places his hand near her armpit, puts her closest arm around his neck, makes him hold out his other hand and then jumps up <br> She tells Iroha to take a picture of 8man bridal carrying her while desperately trying to keep her skirt on her butt so no one can take a peek at her panties. <br> She kisses him on the cheek and his face lights up <br> Komachi rejection,I'm sorry, but don't act like his girlfriend unless you can make

baking set as one of it's prizes <br> Iroha says she can't make pastries or cook much at home because all her family has is a hotplate <br> 8man skillfully wins it for Iroha <br> Komachi gets mad he didn't win anything for her and makes him swear to get her an appliance for Christmas </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She storms off and bumps into an eldritch horror <br> 8man comes up

Why don't I just break her heart completely wouldn't that just solve the problem?"<br>He wouldn't hate Yui just because Iroha can't handle her.<br><br> Mall date was on a Sunday.

I just really wanted a way to keep Haruno in the story.<br><br><br>I never said he hates Yui, it's just she's putting Iroha under diress.<br>He already rejected Yui and maybe breaking her heart to protect Iroha will help Yui get over her crush and she can grow as character.<br><br>Also it's a fanfic anon. A couple people like the Iroha poorfag shit. I'm pandering to Irohafags since it's an Iroha fanfic.<br><br>Yukino can join the go home club and eat her lunch on the rooftop or in the restroom to avoid people.<br><br>I'll compile this shit and actually try to write it out half-decently.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Forgot to add that since Haruno knows the name Hikigaya because of the car accident, she probably knows he is going to the same highschool. <br><br>She could casually ask him about Yukino thinking she wouldn't be so autistic and forget to apologize to the one she ran over and be surprised by 8man's answer since they never talked before and how he sees through her façade</br></br></br>  <br> He already rejected Yui and maybe breaking her heart to protect Iroha will help Yui get over her crush and she can grow as character. <br>I doubt jabbing the knife then twisting it really helps anyone, just because Yui wants to eat ice cream with her this somehow causes Iroha to cry out to 8man.<br>This just seems really weird.<br><br><br> Yukino can join the go home club and eat her lunch on the rooftop or in the restroom to avoid people. <br>Rooftop is off limits according to Yumiko and she isn't that autistic to resort to that just to be alone.<br>Since she never joined the club she never sought any need to save people her whole "noblesse oblige" does not exist.<br>That would mean she is by all means just the Ice Queen, she would've either been surrounded by those girls that idolized her or she would've have sought any of the "loner locations" which 8man knows all about.<br><br>But eh, it's fanfiction and I have an autistic sense for crap like this,  sorry. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Iroha breaks into tears and rambles on about how Yui is being sulky and trying to get her to go out and eat lots of icecream(Iroha can't go out unless someone else is treating her and Yui is not a desperate boy) <br> &gt;His onii-chan instincts kick in, he devises a plan to pretend to go on a date with Iroha and act all affectionate to make Yui leave the club(A skill he uses quite often, when he goes out with Komachi to ward off boys) <br><br> Iroha is a manipulative bitch even in her own fan fiction </br></br></br></br>  Stop talking about that shitty OoC fan fiction.<br>You were fueling him.</br>  <br>Ok, let's talk about Sensei's panties color, then.</br>  <br>It helps make the story more consistent, so thanks editor-kun.<br><br>Well let's just say 8man also rationalized turning Yui's sadness into hatred would make her more productive.

Even so, Hayato keeps on insisting that fact that they couldn't have been friends.<br><br>As you can see, Hayato and Haruno are in the same syndicate.

The last bit of volume 9 especially stands out since it prominently featured Yui smoothing things over between Iroha and Yukino (one of the people she really has issues dealing with)</br>  <br>I'll bite<br> NTR <br>I don't see 8man getting butthurt over it.<br>Faggots who actually voted for the NTR tags are cucks like you.<br><br>You don't like seeing girls getting deepthroated to the verge of tears?<br>You don't like seeing girls forcing their female friends to orgasm?<br>You don't like seeing girls fucked so hard they wet themselves?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well she finally got the femininity she always wanted.<br>Slut.</br></br>  <br>Yui smoothes things between Yukino and Iroha because she doesn't want them to fight. However, their relationship is shallow<br><br> “Okay, okay, so about making that free newspaper, why don’t you go look up how to make it first? Try asking some people with the know-how and get their help… After that, we can make it together with you!” <br> “You’re so kind, Yui-senpai!” Isshiki made an elated smile when Yuigahama addressed her warmly. But after careful examination of her words, Yuigahama was certainly kind, but she was actually saying to “come back another time.” <br><br>She literally told her to fuck off</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think you know what the word "literally" means.</br>  What is a "coming-of-age" picture?<br><br>Also could it be that Iroha didn't show the picture by accident but rather a declaration of war?</br></br>  <br>Get with the times gramps.</br>  <br>I'd say there's an argument for it that that's the closest your average japanese person could get to saying "fuck off" but he's still clearly exaggerating because of his personal bias.

Also people don't really praise Maeda, sure the story he writes is decent at times, but that's exactly what it is: one story. He can only write one story. I haven't seen this show, but even the characters in his works are very similar.  Key anime are always the same shit.  <br>It doesnt taste bad</br>  <br>You try eating it continuously since you were a kid, see what happens.</br>  <br>She doesn't cook bad at all.<br>She just adds the pizza sauce to everything since her brother used to love it, and she thinks that he still loves that while the truth is that he has come to hate the sweet taste of it as he grew up.</br></br>  <br>Maeda certainly is overrated, but not exactly the worst writer in the world. It's just that very few writers can write passable scripts while making new songs.</br>  The whole joke is retarded as fuck. The imouto is what, 11? 12? An age at which she wouldn't kill herself if he just told her to stop adding the shitty sauce to everything.  <br>Is that plant behind them just a photo?</br>  Jesus Christ. <br><br>The running joke is obviously setting up for him breaking down in tears, reminiscing when his imouto was still alive and how he misses that shitty tasting sauce. <br><br>It's so fucking obvious, how do you not see this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope so, she's really annoying.</br>  <br>She's a kid.</br>  I wonder how round her butt is.  <br> annoying <br>You meant heavenly cute.</br></br>  <br>Running joke is Maeda's favorite form of humour.</br>  The common theory as to why they're playing this running gag up so often is that  they're setting up the running theme of him not appreciating her for when they kill her off, with the taste of Pizza sauce being the trigger that makes him remember her.    <br>Sounds about right.</br>  <br>So his sense of humour is shit</br>  <br>goddammit<br>that's so fucking retarded but I know it could happen</br></br>  <br>Maeda sure knows how not to be subtle</br>    Maeda peaked with Air and Clannad.

Guy needs to try something different someday. Maybe even leave school settings.</br>  So what was better, The Neon Genesis manga or anime?  <br>The Anime. <br>But the Manga was good in its own right.</br></br>  anime  Manga  <br>Rebuilds</br>  <br>Manga has more character development for some characters and feels more realistic (Toji death, Kaworu in action).</br>  <br>anime is much better<br><br>the manga is effectively a novelization anymore, sort of a greatest hits version, and it removes some of the great things about the series which is the action sequences (doesn't work as stills) and emotional voice acting, and the bold colors<br><br>also the manga goes retard in the end with a time loop that works into the rebuilds which are garbage</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This.<br><br>The manga is worth a read but the anime is overall way better.</br></br></br>  <br>I just started the manga. It definitely feels like a supplement for fans of the anime. It's excellent in that regard though.</br>  Which was done better? M: Shinji choking Nagisa in the plains symbolism or A: EVA-01 crushing Nagisa after long pause  <br>Does anyone actually think this unironically? I have never met anyone.</br>  <br>The latter is far more iconic and has more impact.</br>  <br>i saw someone who did once<br>basically an insufferable nincompoop</br></br>  <br>Your answer is correct. The former made me more sad though</br>  <br>Since Karl was around longer, you ended up caring about him and his death more. <br>But Kaworu was just done better overall.</br></br>  The manga has a austistic ending.  Any fan of 2.0 should read the manga as it's the same kind of thing but with more development for some characters and a little bit less of the stuff NGE fans complain about. <br><br> NGE is still better </br></br>  <br>Greetings anon. I prefer Rebuilds over NGE unironically.</br>  <br>Why?</br>  <br> people liking the manga unironically <br>Ok the art wasn't too bad sadamoto is based and all, but holy fuck NGE manga is a trainwreck battleshounen with random infodumps between battles, everything is lost compared to the anime, the subtlty, the pacing, the characters, the symbolism, the psychology, it just left the mecha aspect in it, in one of 3-in-1 volume interviews Sadamoto said his target demographics was ~12-14 year olds compared to Anno's ~14-16 if i remember it right.<br>Basically saying manga is admitting to not understanding EVA and liking things simplified and casual.<br>Only reason i enjoyed manga was high quality art and Kaworu actually getting more time  he is still underdeveloped <br><br>I'd say read the last chapter of the manga, it's interesting to see the aftermath of EoE  that was actually totally unnecessary and that Mari chapter, but the rest isn't worth it unless you're a massive Eva nerd, and even then you will hate it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't forget Shiro Sagisu, his OST made this shit much more enjoyable http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=f06W<wbr>STwpI_Q</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  I just want to say, I think Asuka is really pretty.<br><br>That's all.</br></br>  <br>in what way? The mari chapter? The one where Shinji walks away into snow finding the way how to live and shit?</br>  <br>She looks pretty in some scenes and looks like a manface tranny in others. NGE is so fucking inconsistent.</br>  <br>Kaworu gets more time in the manga but he's a fucking faggot and kills a cat and shit.<br> I kind of like how 3.0 gave him more time but he was still likeable </br></br>  <br>I guess it's because I didn't watched NGE until a few years ago. I never got into it, however I really liked the concept of the series and most of the characters, but I didn't fully enjoyed the psychological side of NGE. The religious references were cool, the ending was nice and EoE had fantastic visuals, however I wasn't pleased at all.<br>I suppose it was "2deep4me" or something like that. The way Rebuilds focus on action, making the characters different from the originals and thus, more likeable to some people is what makes me feel that way about it. It's like how comic book industry reboots their characters in alternate universes so they can sell to different audiences.<br><br>tl;dr<br>While I enjoyed most of NGE, Rebuild is easier to understand and relate to a simpler audience, like me.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>But 3.0 is more 2deep4u and convoluted than NGE ever was.</br>    <br>It was? I guess I missed the point (again) then.<br>3.0 wasn't as good as the previous movies, but it was refreshing to see something really different from the original story. I can't wait to see how things turn out in 3.0+1.0</br></br>  Kaworu and Rei are still my favorite Eva characters. Just the two I related to the most.  <br> relating to psychopathic genderless aliens <br>How.</br></br>  <br>Does this imply that 2.0 fans are absolute shit eaters and 3.33 was the best thing since EoE?  Because that would be fucking right<br/> <br><br><br>Time doesn't equal development though, and that is what's more worth it in the end<br><br>autism</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno, I have a form of autism and I just relate to how they connect with the world.</br>  <br>That's kind of cute, anon-kun.</br>  Unpopular opinion thread    <br>Nice bait.</br>  <br>It makes you look like an idiot and as you just saw people might treat you like one. It's just a part of the etiquette.</br>    Ryo is shit<br>Kaworu is much better</br>  Several hours to the invasion of earth by Stardust, no YuYuYu thread, let me correct it  <br>Soon.</br>  <br>Oh shit, I was out of the loop for a while.<br>Do we have chara designs for the other four yet?</br></br>   Jap sword <br>Confirmed for the Tougo level of shit</br>  <br>only these two and Chikage Kouri revealed so far</br>  <br> Chikage Kouri <br>Please post.</br></br>    <br> that casual clothes Wakaba <br><br>Wonderful.</br></br></br>  Wakaba &gt; Chikage &gt; Hinata  <br>Guess we've got our OTP now, huh. From what I can make out of Hinata's description<br> Uesato Hinata  <br> Wakaba's childhood, as well as, best friend <br> Often taking care of Wakaba <br> Has a mild personality but actually really strong <br> Always protecting Wakaba's soul <br>And something about Wakaba<br> Serious <br> Has a strong will and body but easily fall for lies and such. <br><br>Chapter 1 will begin in 2015, 3 years before the real story starts. Wakaba and Hinata in those casual clothes are in 4 grade.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Outlaw Wonderland -zero- <br> Author: Tanaka Romeo <br>Sweet, I never heard of it but if it's Romeo it's worth taking a look. I hope we get scans for that too.</br></br></br>  <br>Some new info<br> As Wakaba is Sonoko's ancestor, this story will reveal many things about the Nogi household <br> Will also touch on the subject of how important a miko is <br> In Nowayu, the existence of Heroes is not a secret. The whole mankind are aware of Vertices' threat. </br></br></br></br>  <br> also touch on the subject of how important a miko is <br>Tougou confirmed for Messiah.</br></br>  <br>YuYuYu also kind hinted at Tougou is quite important as a messenger, further increase the chance that Yuuna got boosted into godhood</br>  I wonder how soon we'll find out what their Yuuna looks like and get to start speculating beyond wild guesses on what their connection is.  <br>I'm fully expecting her to look exactly like Yuuna.</br>  <br>If she does, we probably won't get an actual picture showing it till it's halfway through, and we'll never get to see what she's thinking.</br>  <br>Don't know how reliable this bit of info is but apparently   grade school Wakaba had to see her new friends getting slaughtered in front of her.  </br>  <br>Are you getting this from 2ch and/or other nip sites?</br>  <br>From here: http://otakomu.jp/archives/284065.h<wbr>tml<br>The spoiler bit is not included in the main article so I don't know if it's valid or not.</br></wbr></br>  Wait what's happening? I didn't follow the other threads.  <br>This is really old news so I don't know how out of the loop you are but, a new LN is being released. It's set 300 years before the anime when the vertex first attacked and the protagonist is Sonoko's ancestor, Nogi Wakaba, hence the name NoWaYu.<br><br>There was also a new LN chapter with the usual Yuushas set after Sonoko After and confirmation that there will be more stuff released with the YuYuYu team, though format was not specified.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, I thought it was an anime announcement or something like that.</br>  <br>When the new LN is getting released?</br>  <br>The newest LN chapter is the one where the Yuushas find the old diary in Sonoko's house, right? And it's only 3 pages long?</br>  Does the new VN already have a full translation patch?<br><br>Yes.</br></br>  <br>Read the OP again.</br>  <br> no male characters <br>I'm glad they know how to keep policies that are working.</br></br>   Wakaba's hair style and personality are somewhat similar to Sumi <br> Hinata's Hinatas and personality are somewhat similar to Tougou  <br>This feels so weird.</br></br>  Definitely seems like this is going to be another darkness-absorbing LN so they can give Yuuna a happy ending in the anime. I hope they at least manage to reincarnate or something.    Chikage and Hinata's last names now are different than what we got about a month ago, right? Is it a mistake? Or will we have a story explanation?  <br>They got mistranslated the first time.</br>  <br> There was also a new LN chapter with the usual Yuushas set after Sonoko After <br>Can I get a link?</br></br>  <br>Yuuna remembering the girls who sacrificed themselves to let her return to her own time.</br>  <br> https://mega.co.nz/#!bEkXnSRK!UTcDo<wbr>kywlhMvp3u1qlL6DviKC80yigoPzAoPGARV<wbr>H3k</wbr></wbr> </br>  <br> Thanks. I forgot, wasn't there a blog with info on YYY compiled? I remember there being one with VN translations </br>  <br>Japanese names are a bitch. Even if you know how a name is written you don't necessarily know how it's pronounced, so people have to make guesses and sometimes those guesses turn out to be wrong.</br>  <br> http://otakomu.jp/archives/284065.<wbr>html</wbr> <br>Do they   lose their families as well? Are they living by themselves on Shikoku? Like the Inubozaki sisters do in the future? </br></br>  http://tieba.baidu.com/p/3930730756<wbr></wbr>  <br>They show them as both 14 and as 4th graders.<br>Looks like there'll really be a timeskip then.</br></br>  <br>The story begin at 2018 but most of the chapter being recalling on what happen in 2015, then towards the end it back to 2018.</br>  <br>Only 3 years. So they are going to show the original attack and then skip to the girls life as heros defending Shinjuu on Shikoku after escaping.</br>  <br>whoa, so fast</br>  the vertex attached in the chapter doesn't look like the 12 zodiac vertexes...  Is translator-kun still around?  <br>The one in the black and white picture looks like the mini vertex.</br>  so if I read correctly, there are only 2 characters have made their debut this chapter?  <br>the B&amp;W one is stardust (so-called vertex cells)</br>  <br>PRAISED BE SHINJU-SAMA<br><br>Now where are our resident translators?</br></br></br>  <br>This afternoon,<br>I peered over the Seto Inland Sea from Marugame Castle.<br>Each time I stand here, I renew my vow.<br>I swear to take back the world stolen from us.<br>We as heroes are the weapons to achieve that goal.<br>Small may our numbers be, but we must fulfill our duty.<br>Among our comrades,<br>A proactive stance like Yuuna's is hard to find in this world.<br>I can see an unstable side to [censored by taisha], but...<br>Hero Record Aug 2018 AD<br>Nogi Wakaba's Record</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> [censored by Taisha] <br>Chikage?</br></br>  <br> A proactive stance like Yuuna's is hard to find in this world. <br><br>Oh damn, so is Yuuna like a legendary hero or something?</br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br> no glasses girls <br>Oh for FUCK'S sake.</br></br>  <br><br>One of Chikage's kanji may have actually changed a bit though. 群 to 郡.

Ever since before she could remember, Wakaba had been training in iai, and thus the weight of that sword felt quite familiar to her body.<br>The midsummer sunlight poured down from above, causing sweat to seep from her skin.<br>Cicadas were chirping busily around her.<br>She closed her eyes.<br>She still vividly remembered-- the despair and anger from that day.<br><br>* * *</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>July 30, 2015<br>Nogi Wakaba, a fifth grader at the time, was taking refuge at a shrine's kagura-den in Shimane Prefecture.<br>She was on a field trip from Kagawa to Shimane when an intense earthquake occurred. Earthquakes kept happening intermittently after that, and so the teachers decided it was an emergency situation and evactuated the students to the shrine, which was the shelter in the area. The number of people in the shelter, which included nearby residents, was quite high.<br>Wakaba's school was holding a field trip in the middle of summer break due to the number of lesson days, but it was completely unexpected that they would get caught in an emergency situation like this.<br>As class president, Wakaba took a roll call of her classmates and informed their homeroom teacher that all were present and accounted for. According to what she heard from the teachers, apparently, the earthquakes weren't happening just in Shimane, but everywhere throughout the country. Fissures and tsunamis were happening as a result, and damage was happening throughout Japan...<br>However, Wakaba and her classmates seemed to actually find it exciting how this turn of events happened during their field trip. Friends were talking amongst each other and those with smartphones were checking news sites.<br>"You think we'll have to stay here until tomorrow?"<br>"Wha? But we're finally on a field trip and everything."<br>"Anyone have cards?"<br>A group of three girls was chatting amongst themselves. Wakaba looked towards them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like the original stardust design. Just the mouth and no body, more alien feeling.</br>  <br>  However, Wakaba and her classmates seemed to actually find it exciting how this turn of events happened during their field trip. Friends were talking amongst each other and those with smartphones were checking news sites <br><br>Stupid kids</br></br></br>  <br>(I should probably warn them... no, there's no need to go that far. Letting them chat like this might actually help soften their anxiety.)<br>As she had that thought in mind,<br>"...Ah, Nogi-san's glaring at us."<br>"Are we being too noisy?"<br>"Let's quiet it down before she gets angry at us."<br>The girls who had been talking softened tehir voices.<br>(Ah... I wasn't particularly mad or anything ...Does my face really look that scary...?)<br>"Wah-kah-bah chan!"<br>Wakaba turned around as the voice called to her to see a camera flash before her eyes. It was her classmate and childhood friend, Uesato Hinata with a smartphone at the ready.<br>"Mmm... Wakaba-chan... you're so picturesque with that listless look on your face. The shrine building in the background is great too. That's one more picture in my treasured Wakaba-chan image collection."<br>"Hi~na~ta~... Don't collect photos of me! Delete it!"<br>"No! This image collection is my lifework!"<br>Hinata boldly declared something incomprehensible.<br>"Please don't make such a scary face. Your forehead's gonna get wrinkly, you know! Squishy squishy."<br>"... Could you please not press on people's foreheads with your fingers?"<br>"I'm just trying to loosen you up. It's because of that strict face of yours that classmates get scared of you just like what happened now."<br>"You... you saw that?"<br>Wakaba's face heated up in embarrassment.<br>"Now, now, Wakaba-chan, it's because you're always so serious. Ever since first grade, you've been an honor student and class president. Our classmates have this image of you being an 'iron woman'."<br>"Uggh..."<br>She was aware of it herself, but it was still a shock to hear it again.<br>"But... You just gotta shatter that image yourself!"<br>Hinata grinned and took Wakaba by the hand as she lead her back to that same group of female classmates.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So Wakaba is Sumi and Hinata is Sonoko?</br>  <br>"H-hey, wait!?"<br>"Good evening!"<br>Hinata ignored Wakaba's confusion as she called out to the girls. The girls were just as confused.<br>"Sorry about that. The truth is that Wakaba-chan wanted to join in on your conversation."<br>"H-Hinata, what are you--!?"<br>"What are you being so embarrassed about? You see, she wasn't thinking of giving you girls a warning. She was actually having a cute little inner struggle of how to join in on the conversation."<br>"Wha? That's not--"<br>When Wakaba tried to deny the story, Hinata covered Wakaba's mouth.<br>"Mmm! Mmm!"<br>The three girls were confused for a second--<br>But eventually that confusion seemed to blow away and they smiled.<br><br>"Hmm, that kinda changes my image of Nogi-san."<br>"Well, she always seems precise, and she's quite the honor student, after all"<br>"Yeah, yeah. I thought she was a scarier, stricter person!"<br>"I see what you mean-- Oh, and Wakaba-chan's unsociable, so she's at a disadvantage in that regard, I think."<br>It was a bizarre progression of events, but Wakaba and Hinata joined the group of three girls and talked with them. Hinata spoke with them as familiarly as one would speak with years-long friends.<br>She had the sociability to get along with anyone, which Wakaba lacked. Because of Wakaba's overly-serious nature, she felt a little disconnected with the rest of the class.<br>"But she's a super cute girl on the inside. I, Uesato Hinata, can attest to that. So please get along with her, okay?"<br>"C-c-c-c-cute...? What are you talking about!?"<br>Despite Wakaba glaring at her, Hinata didn't shy away and just said 'now now'.<br>"Ahahah, that's so funny. Don't worry. We're already friends with Nogi-san now."<br>The girls smiled and said that as they saw Wakaba and Hinata's interactions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>that one out of frame girl</br>  <br>Is that Youko in the back?</br>  <br>Hinata has boobs already in 4th grade?<br>She must eat the same food as Hotaru from Non Non Biyori.</br></br>  <br>After they had talked for a while, Wakaba went outside the kagura-den. Though it was already evening, the July heat was still substantial, so she wanted to feel a little bit of the evening breeze.<br>From time immemorial, a shrine's torii was said to be a boundary to an outer world. Back in the age before people had forgotten religious piety, a shrine was treated as another world. Wakaba did not know that shrines held that meaning, but she was able to feel the place's tranquility.<br>When she looked up at the sky, she could see the twinkling of countless stars.<br>"So this is where you were, Wakaba-chan. It's getting late. Aren't you going to sleep?"<br>Hinata had gone outside as well and she stood beside Wakaba.<br>"Well, a problem could arise while we're sleeping for all we now. I thought I'd stay awake just in case."<br>"The teachers should be the ones to stay awake, though."<br>"I'm class president, so it's my duty."<br>"Haah~... Really, Wakaba-chan. I don't know if you're just being way too serious or what."<br>Hinata smiled slightly in resignation.<br>"So I'll stay awake with you."<br>"... You don't need to accompany me, you know?"<br>"No, it's because I'm your childhood friend. I'll always be with you."<br>When Hinata answered in such a clear tone of voice, Wakaba had no more forceful words to say.<br>"... Hinata."<br>"What is it?"<br>"Thanks for what you did back there. If you weren't around, I would've ended up distancing myself from our classmates again."<br>"No, no, I just don't like it when people misunderstand you, Wakaba-chan."<br>Hinata spoke as if she had only done the natural thing to do.<br>But Wakaba wasn't satisfied with just that.<br>"A reward for everything. That's the Nogi way of life."<br>That was a commandment that Wakaba's grandmother often spoke of. Wakaba loved her grandmother dearly, and so she treasured those words of hers.<br>"So I want to reward you for your friendship, Hinata. If there's anything you want me to do for you, then just ask.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So this is 4th grade. So they are Nanoha/Fate age? Or the age of Vivio in Vivid?</br>  <br>I'm expecting rest of the chapter be about Wakaba rewarding Hinata.</br>  <br>"Well, if you insist... hmm, then how about you help me grow my treasured image collection by wearing... some sort of cosplay? ... While we're at it, how about something a little extreme..."<br>Hinata muttered something improper.<br>Perhaps Wakaba spoke too soon... she was starting to regret her decision a little.<br>"Well, I'll take my time to think of what I should have you do, Wakaba-chan. Anyway, for now, it'd be great for you to be more at ease when you talk to people in class. If you do, then everyone else will start to understand you and get along with you better. If you ever get nervous about talking to someone, I'll help you out just like I did now."<br>Hinata's words slowly sank into Wakaba's body.<br>(I can get along with everyone better... huh?)<br>Wakaba was a little detached from the class, but perhaps she herself had been unconsciously distancing herself from her classmates. Perhaps if she actually tried talking to people like they did now, it would be simple to get along with everyone.<br><br>"Ah, but then if you get really popular, you might not care about me anymore, Wakaba-chan. You'll toss me out like a woman of the past [TN: basically an ex-girlfriend, but I don't think Wakaba caught that part], won't you... yoyoyo."<br>"Wh-what are you talking about!? Of course I wouldn't do that! No matter what happens, you're my best friend!"<br>As Wakaba struggled to put together words, Hinata smiled strangely.<br>"It was just a joke. Oh, Wakaba-chan--"<br><br>Suddenly, the ground shook intensely.<br><br>(This... is on a completely different scale than the other tremors...!)<br>The tremors made it difficult to even stand. Wakaba kept her stance lowered to prevent herself from falling down. Beside her, Hinata let out a small shriek as her rear fell to the ground.<br>After a few dozen seconds, the tremors settled.<br>"That was a huge tremor, huh... Hinata, you okay?"<br>Wakaba held her hand out to Hinata.<br>But without taking her hand, Hinata just muttered with a ghostly pale look on her face.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   When she looked up at the sky, she could see the twinkling of countless stars. <br><br>I don't think they are stars Wakaba...</br></br>  <br> Shimane Prefecture <br>Seems like the setting is some totally irrelevant backwater again. It's probably safer to stay away from the cities when the gods themselves want to exterminate your species.<br><br><br>They should be around 10 years old, so they're about as old as Vivio in Vivid or Nanoha in A's.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuuna, what are you doing slightly off panel 300 years ago?</br>  Did we get anything new at wonfes?  <br> Shimane Prefecture <br>Also home of the Izumo Shrine, one of the oldest continuously operating shrines in Shinto.</br></br>  <br>Could anyone else see her or does she only appear in camera shots like in Re-Kan?<br>I guess this confirms Yuuna was "spirit traveling" during her vegetative state?</br></br>  <br>Also those other 2 girls have different eyes without circles. Probably not important though.</br>  <br>Whoa, you're right. Isn't the Izumo Shrine also the one where the legend about the war between Amaterasu and the gods of the Earth came from?<br><br>Seems pretty likely that Izumo even is the shrine where Wakaba and her girls are taking shelter in, considering it's just about the only location of interest for a school trip in the region.</br></br></br>  <br>According to Wiki, another name for the shrine is Izumo-TAISHA. Coincidence? I think not.</br>  <br> Isn't the Izumo Shrine also the one where the legend about the war between Amaterasu and the gods of the Earth came from? <br>Yup. That leak is sounding more and more legit the more we learn.</br></br>  <br>"I'm scared..."<br>"Huh?"<br>Hinata's body was trembling slightly.<br>"Wa-Wakaba-chan... s... something really, really scarey is..."<br>She looked up to the sky as she spoke.<br>Thinking there was something up there, Wakaba looked up as well.<br>On her first look, what she saw was an ordinary starry sky.<br>But she was mistaken.<br>The countless stars in the sky squirmed as if they were drifting about on the surface of water.<br>At first, Wakaba thought the star-like objects were birds or something.<br>But their movements were irregular and it would be strange for so many birds to be flying in the sky so late at night.<br>And then several of those stars got bigger and bigger--<br><br>Despair fell from the sky.<br><br>One of the star-like objects fell onto the roof of the kagura-den. It definitely was not a bird at all. Its entire body was an almost unnatural white, its size far more gigantic than a human, with an ominous mouth-like organ. It appeared to be like a deep sea animal that had evolved far differently than terrestrial animals, or possibly an invertebrate that was born under imperfect conditions. In any case, it was clearly different from any living being known to mankind, and therefore, the simplest name to call it was-- a "monster".<br>And it wasn't alone. Two, three... several came falling from the sky in quick succession, tearing apart the kagura-den's roof and walls with their teeth and breaking in.<br>"What... are those things...?"<br>Wakaba stood stock still at the bizarre sight unraveling before her.<br>On unsteady feet-- Hinata stood up. A strange light imbued her eyes and hex-like words leaked from her mouth.<br><br>"--...----......----......----"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Despair fell from the sky. <br>The happening</br></br>    <br> A strange light imbued her eyes and hex-like words leaked from her mouth. <br>Hinata is a miko?</br></br>  <br>It looks like Chikage has them as well.</br>  Should i continue with creating a pdf version of noginovel?<br> http://www.mediafire.com/view/met38<wbr>3707ycggib/Nogi_Wakaba_is_a_Hero.pd<wbr>f</wbr></wbr> </br>  <br>Yes, please do it dear anon.</br>  <br>Yes please</br>  <br>Everyone has them, just not those 2.</br>  <br>The moment Wakaba tried to ask what was wrong, people darted out from inside the kagura-den, screaming.<br>"Kyaaaaaaaah!!"<br>"Wh-wha-what are those monsters!?"<br>(Khh!)<br>Wakaba immediately rushed to the kagura-den. Hinata grabbed her by the hand.<br>"I'm going too."<br>The strange light had disappeared from Hinata's eyes, and instead, they displayed an intense will. Her tone of voice was firm as well.<br>Wakaba began to wonder what was with her bizarre state just a few seconds ago...? There was no time to think about that. All that mattered now was to protect their classmates for now.<br><br>Wakaba and Hinata rushed into the kagura-den. And what they saw-- was people being eaten.<br>The bizarre white creatures were eating the people who were too slow to escape with their mouth-like organs. Their mouths became stained red by blood and beneath their giant bodies were pieces of half-eaten people. Including the completely disfigured remains of students from Wakaba's school.<br>"Ah... ahh..."<br>A groan leaked out of Wakaba's mouth.<br>She couldn't believe the scene unfurling before her eyes. It felt too unreal. The friends she had been enjoyed talking to less than an hour ago were now reduced to unspeakable remains.<br>"Waaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!!)<br>Wakaba rushed towards the bizarre creatures. She was driven by rage for her murdered friends and the sense of duty to prevent any further death. As she ran, she picked up a fragment of wood that had probably broken off when the roof was destroyed, and pierced the fragment's pointed end into one of the monsters.<br>But... for some reason, there was no feedback.<br>The white giant flung Wakaba away like a bug. Her small body fell onto an altar inside the shrine. The altar broke, sending a shock and pain through Wakaba's entire body.<br>"Ugh... gh..."<br>Her body wouldn't move.<br>She moved just her head and saw the bizarre creatures looking her way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The classmates don't.</br>  <br>I rechecked some parts of anime and everyone has those circles.</br>  <br> Their mouths became stained red by blood and beneath their giant bodies were pieces of half-eaten people. Including the completely disfigured remains of students from Wakaba's school. <br><br>fucking brutal</br></br></br>  <br>I'm talking about the other two in </br>  <br>Okada is that you?</br>  <br><br><br>Ok, she's dead, she wasn't neither of the 2 Yuunas.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't jink it, anon.</br>  <br> The friends she had been enjoyed talking to less than an hour ago were now reduced to unspeakable remains. <br>I could pass on an anime adaption of that</br></br>  <br>Don't worry. Anime adaptation would be Taisha censored.</br>  <br>If there's spirit-time-travel shenanigans going on, then anything could have happened with Yuuna. I doubt they have time to count the bodies.</br>  <br>I hope there's no time travel, that would be pretty fucking stupid.</br>  <br>Nah, I bet Miss Out of Frame is hiding somewhere else. Why give her eye circles when those other two clear nobodies had none otherwise? I doubt Wakaba was specifically surveying the remains to check that absolutely everyone was dead, she just recognized a few, and assumed the rest.</br>  <br>Seems the most straightfoward explanation for Yuuna being familiar with Wakaba.</br>  <br>Why? They already showed in the WaSuYu manga that Shinju can make them time travel, it makes sense he did the same with Yuuna too.</br>  <br>There was wasuyu manga?</br>  <br>Did I miss something? Because I just remember that Yuuna was silent when they found the 2nd hero diary, I'm not sure how that means she's familiar with her.<br><br>Really? Well, if that's canon material, then that opens up a whole bunch of plot holes like "why don't they go back in time to save Gin from dying" for just one example</br></br></br>  <br>It had like 30 chapters of 4komas, this one was an special:<br><br>http://pastebin.com/k4tYcrXm<br><br>There's a link to download it there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> However, Wakaba and her classmates seemed to actually find it exciting how this turn of events happened during their field trip. <br>It's just Wakaba's classmates who find it exciting. The whole phrase 若葉と同学生の生徒たち can also mean simply Wakaba's classmates. I made the same mistake while reading and got confused because it seemed to contradict the rest of the scene so I came to check.</br></br>  <br>Maybe it's just memories of previous Yuushas coming back like in Vivid?</br>  <br>I also think this might be the case.</br>  <br>The people who were quick enough to react had already fled the building, but some of the children in Wakaba's grade were paralyzed with fear.<br>(Run... away...)<br>Wakaba tried to yell that, but she could hardly even muster a whisper. The children who were too slow to run away, and Wakaba herself were all being cornered by the monsters.<br>But then, Hinata's voice rang out.<br>"Wakaba-chan, please reach out your right hand! It should be there!"<br>(My hand...?)<br>Wakaba reached out her right hand as told.<br>She felt it touch something.<br><br>A sword.<br><br>A sword and scabbard rusted from the passing years had been inside the broken altar.<br>(Why... why would a sword be here...?)<br>Wakaba grasped the grip and pulled it in.<br>Throb. Blood suddenly started pounding through her entire body.<br>She felt like she was on fire.<br>She felt like she was drowning.<br>And at the same time-- an unknown strength welled up inside of her as if to reconstruct her body into something else entirely.<br><br>In ancient times, there was a king of the gods of the land whose name was 《Musuu no Buki (無数の武器/Infinite Weapons)》.<br>He and his fellow gods tried to protect the children of their country.<br>Among the king's sacred treasures was a sword from the underworld.<br>Simple. Yet beautiful. A weapon unmatched in murderous power.<br>Its name-- 《Ikutachi (生大刀/The Life Force Blade)》<br><br>When she snapped back to her senses, Wakaba was standing up with that very sword in hand. She could've sworn the blade was rusted, but before she had realized it, the blade was tinged with a vibrant, almost living, brilliance.<br><br>Wakaba sheathed the sword, brought her left foot forward, and held the grip,<br><br><br>You're right.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this the end?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>There should be few more pages, link to raws is in this thread too.</br>  <br>There is another 5 pages of text</br>  When will the second chapter be out anyway?

She had trained in iai since childhood. Her accumulated experience moved her body naturally.<br>The white monster's giant body approached.<br>As Wakaba drew it from its sheath, her sword was light itself.<br>The being that entered its range was instantly split in two.<br>As Wakaba resheathed the sword, the split monster let out a hard-to-describe cry and vanished.<br>And then one by one, Wakaba cut down the onslaught of bizarre creatures, each with a single stroke of her sword. It was a mysterious sensation. The sword was easy to handle, as if it were but an extension of her arm, and her body moved as swiftly as the wind.<br>In the blink of an eye, all the monsters in the kagura-den were eradicated.<br>"Wakaba-chan! Those strange things are overflowing outside too!"<br>Hinata screamed that as she ran towards Wakaba.<br><br>Before they had realized it, tremendous numbers of the monsters had the kagura-den surrounded outside. The people who tried to escape began to despair at their loss of escape routes.<br>As Wakaba left the kagura-den, she gripped her sword.<br><br>No matter how many dozens of enemies there were, she would not falter--<br>"... Wh-what...?"<br>Something unusual happened with the monsters.<br>Several of them lumped together in the same place and conglomerated like clay, changing form into something even more gigantic...<br>Some changed into a form like a centipede.<br>Some changed into a form like a body surface with an arrow.<br>Some changed into a form like the edge of a section of body tissue, stiffening and rising up.<br>(... They're... evolving...?)<br>Perhaps they had learned that they individually could not defeat Nogi Wakaba. The means they had chosen to oppose an existence stronger than themselves was to "evolve".<br>The evolution of animals was to begin with the simplest single celled organism, take several of those single celled organisms together to create a colony, and from colonies, complex multi-cellular organisms would arise.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The evolution of animals <br>I meant biological evolution, whoops.</br></br>  <br>Take your time, no need to rush. I can wait as long as it takes.</br>  <br>I can't, type until your fingers bleed.</br>  <br> wanting to kill one of the barely existent TS. <br>Vertex, please, don't you have another things to do?</br></br>  The fact that 2015 and 2018 are respectively the dates of the attack and when NoWaYu takes place gives a lot of credibility to the info leak last year. Not to mention the "Gods of the Land" being mentioned in the story. Going by it<br><br> 2015 A.D. - The gods of heaven seeing how mankind has prospered, decide that they have to purge them because they are growing impudent. They send the Vertexes to do execute that task. The gods of the land sided with mankind and took the form of Shinju-sama.  <br> 2018 A.D. - Vertexes invade Shikoku. Some humans are granted the power of Shinju-sama. The first heroes appear. The following year, mankind has managed to repel the vertexes, but they barely have any defenses left. Mankind got the vertexes attacks to be stopped on the condition that they don't leave that land.  <br><br>We're going to be seeing a lot of dead heroes. And<br><br> 2023 A.D. - Taisha and the Gorvenment establish a new system. The Anno Domini era ends. The following year is year 1 of the era of the gods. The era of worshiping Shinju begins. <br><br>We'll have a time skip at some point, perhaps just an epilogue.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So are we going to see Wakaba becoming the head of the Taisha? Wakaba obviously has to survive seeing as how she's Sonoko's great great great great great grandma  <br><br>What the white monsters were undergoing was truly biological evolution itself, except at an abnormal speed.<br>It took billions and billions of years for life on earth to evolve from single-celled organisms to multi-cellular organisms. And yet it took these monsters mere minutes.<br>In a certain sense, those monsters could perhaps be said to surpass all life on earth. They were beings like "gods" or "demons"--<br>One of the creatures that had conglomerated and increased in size shot out the arrow that its body had produced. The arrow pierced through all the people in its trajectory, wrecking the kagura-den at the end of its path. With just one strike, a third of the kagura-den crumbled to the ground.<br>Meanwhile, the number of the smaller monsters grew and grew, repeating the cycle of conglomerating and changing form, giving birth to countless numbers of the large monsters.<br>All thoughts of winning disappeared completely from Wakaba's mind. How could she win against countless numbers of enemies with unthinkable destructive force?<br>Right as her entire body threatened to collapse out of despair--<br>What supported her was her best friend.<br>"Please don't give up, Wakaba-chan."<br>"...

Any number of SCPs should have completely removed it from existence already.</br>  <br>Because it's virtually indestructible. It's normally kept suspended in a cell flooded with acid.

On top of that, it's just very strong and can grow stronger from eating.</br>  <br>Then they probably torture her until she is nearly dead and then heal her afterwards.</br>  <br>Nah, the joke of 999 is that he looks like an abomination but everyone finds him cute.</br>  Reading the SCP-231 article makes me feel like shit.  <br>That much is obvious.

Hair is black, and eyes are gray, skin tone olive. Subject is 1.96 m in height and 81.65 kg in weight. Numerous tattoos depicting arcane and occult iconography are present all over the body (mostly in the form of leering demonic faces) and ranges from subtle to openly ostentatious. Subject, when encased inside SCP-076-1, is technically dead. <br>  <br> SCP-076-2's most unusual ability, however, is its ability to apparently materialize bladed weapons out of nowhere. Slow-motion video footage reveals that the blades in question are actually pulled from a miniature dimensional rift described as a "small hole in space." Where this portal leads is unknown, as is how SCP-076-2 is capable of generating said rifts. Footage of the blades in question shows them to be made out of a completely non-reflective black material appearing as a "black void in space." As the blades rapidly vanish after leaving the subject's possession, no structural analysis is possible at this time.<br>Wait a second, isn't this just Gilgamesh+Avenger?</br></br></br></br>  ID on all?<br><br>Gelbooru still is incomplete with that.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, he's basically Gil, but more hax.<br><br>He's actually Abel or Cain, cant remember.<br><br>Also, most SCPs are capable killing Servants.</br></br></br></br></br>  And why was 953 suppossed to be deadly or scary again?<br><br>She's basically a 2hu</br></br>  <br>Just finished reading the article<br>If only there were people so nice in real life</br></br>  Boy their shithole really went to hell.

At least, those are the ones I'm sure of.</br>  Which SCP would be the best waifu?  <br>But 2hus are good girls.</br>  <br>999, the guy who makes Guro toys (forgot the number) and the eye ball things (that i also forgot the number) are there too.<br><br><br>I don't know waifu, but see  for husbando</br></br></br></br>  <br> but upon opening SCP-1230, all its pages were soaking wet with the same message on every page: “I’m so sorry. I never intended for this to happen. I just wanted to make people happy.” repeated over and over. SCP-1230 remained in this state for three weeks and its desk  <br><br>Oh god, that's so sad.</br></br></br>  I like 106 and the one about the furry murdering korean foxgirl. <br><br><br>that's horrible, but funny. My favorite is doctor bright's things he's not allowed to do</br></br></br>  <br>That's the fate of any community that got too successful/popular for its own damn good.</br>  So 073 and 076 are ancient astronauts or something?  Which one is the little girl that telepathically compels people to rape her?  <br>I thought that was from the Monster Girl Encyclopedia thing</br>  #11-18.  <br>191 is carrying the calculator and digital camera.</br>  They need to purge every humanoid SCP and animal SCP. The ratio of shitty ones to good ones is too high to justify. <br>Of course it will never happen because 90% of them are written by esteemed members of the community's hierarchy.</br>  <br> The camera that photographs your truest desire <br><br> Subject: SCP-173 <br> Photographed Activity: Standing in its container. <br> Photo Result: No change. <br><br>Either it's not truly sentient or  it's exactly where it wants to be.  I'm not sure which is worse.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see what's so bad about the latter.<br>Maybe it doesn't want to kill people.</br></br>  <br>Evidence from any time someone blinks while in its presence suggests otherwise.</br>  <br> Subject: SCP-451 <br> Photographed Activity: Weeping in Site-19 cafeteria. <br> Photo Result: SCP-451 lies awake in a bunk in the Site-19 sleeping quarters, surrounded by other staff members. SCP-451 exhibits a look of relief on his face. <br><br>Oh god.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Could be an unwilling reflex response.</br>  <br><br>According to her case file, no other SCPs, drugs, or procedures are allowed to be used on her aside from Procedure 110 montauk and the Class A Amnesiac she must be administered weekly so that the emotional pain she must endure is always at it's peak.<br><br>It's just rape, at worst, it's gang rape and beating. Nothing she couldn't survive on her own, but definitely shit that causes her a lot of pain and possibly very minor permanent damage. She's not allowed to be given anesthetics either.<br><br>Shits fucked. At least they're trying to find a cure for her.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's worse than rape.<br>The foundation is just more imaginative than you.</br></br>  <br>It's not.<br>The author is just full of shit. gotta go for that true horror factor mate.<br>They aren't mutilating her. They're emotionally torturing her.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not torture if it's for science</br>  <br>it's not rape if she can't remember</br>  <br>Then why do the doctors assigned to SCP 231-7 commit sudoku as result of merely witnessing the procedure.</br>  Is there a loli SCP?<br>Can't remember.</br>  <br>The scientific data is just too much for them to handle.</br>  <br>It'd clearly have to be much worse than rape to induce that.</br>  <br><br>I love the friendly SCPs. Because despite their power, they still strive to be decent things in a world of fucked up monsters and horrors.</br></br>  How come sometimes I see japanese artists doing SCP shit?<br>How do they find out about it? Most jap artists are terrible at english.</br>  <br>Sometimes it's the japs who translate our shit and not the other way around.</br>  <br/>  <br>The one that befriended 682, the cyborg and the reality warper spring to mind</br>  <br>231 probably counts. <br>She's between the ages of  [REDACTED]  and  [REDACTED] <br><br>You think some people wouldn't kill themsevles if it was their job to to watch an innocent, probably underaged, be repeatedly raped/beaten. <br>Not everyone gets as much pleasure from watching that as you do.

(setting: 1:1) <br><br> Output: Male Hispanic, 42 years old, 100kg, 188cm tall. Subject was very confused and agitated. Subject attacked security personnel. Subject terminated. <br><br>Hahaha that poor fucker. No one should have to die a mexican. I thought this SCP improved things.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 1:1 <br> improve things </br></br>  That book that absorbs blood and keeps re-writing the past is so fucking creepy.  Is there an SCP ona hole?  <br>There's a dildo that causes you to melt from pleasure</br>  <br>Literally melt?<br>Why are the object SCPs so dangerous and confusing?</br></br>  <br>Not all of them are dangerous, but their confusing nature is what makes them require SCP. They are objects that cannot be explained though conventional means.</br>  <br>http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-297<br> When turned to the highest intensity setting (labeled "suicide"), SCP-297's vibration frequency swiftly increases to upwards of 200,000 kHz. If the upper portion of the device is touched to any solid material, SCP-297 will change frequency to one that causes a positive harmonic feedback loop in the object, causing the object to lose cohesion within sixty seconds of continual contact. This invariably kills organisms that it is exposed to. </br></br>  <br>Because all the other objects go to warehouse 13.</br>  <br> 108kg, 185cm tall to 100kg, 188cm tall <br> not an improvement <br>when will you learn</br></br></br>  http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1478<br><br>These cactus are fucking assholes holy shit.</br></br>  There's a yotsuba doujin that have a SCP twist in it. Check it on sadpanda.  <br> Why are the object SCPs so dangerous and confusing? <br>Because "SCP" means "Secure. Contain. Protect."<br>The story is about securing and containing things, and to a limited extent protecting things.<br>If it's not dangerous or confusing, why the hell would it be there? Things that are both safe and nominal are not SCPs.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Because "SCP" means "Secure. Contain. Protect." <br>SCP actually stands for "Special Containment Procedures," which is what the Foundation creates to contain the anomalous objects.</br></br>  <br>That's a bit of chicken and egg, isn't it? It's both.</br>  <br> If it's not dangerous or confusing, why the hell would it be there? <br>So the Foundation can protect it from abuse by other people. Can you imagine the pizza box exposed to the world? That would crash the existing pizza economies, if not the entire food industry. It creates matter from nothing.</br></br>  I didn't know stuff like this existed  http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-348<br><br><br> Subject: 6-year-old male, recently injured self while playing with friends (minor scrapes and scratches) <br> Brief Background: Parents divorced, currently lives with mother <br> Notes: Message appeared, I’m sorry, son. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn.</br>  <br>Iris was lucky to be transferred out by the time 076 went bananas again.</br>  <br> didn't know she was 2D <br> they went to ridiculous extremes to keep her from finding out <br> found out by accident <br> now showing symptoms of clinical depression <br>Fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Reminds me of that comic strip where an artist draws a generic loli and draws himself asking her what she wants, and she replies "I want to be real," with a smile on her face. And then he kills himself with a shot through the head.</br></br>  <br>That's a confusing item. You've violated the proposition.</br>  <br><br>Idea is basically if it survives it, it becomes immune to it which is why they don't use the last resort options right off the bat, like nuking it or sending it off into a black hole or some shit. Every time it escapes, they have to device a new powerful method to incapacitate it. <br><br>Also, bad writing and it becoming a meme that even the admins got fucking tired of. 682 was fun at first, but now it's overblown.</br></br></br></br>  /a/, would you work at the SCP Foundation if given the chance?  <br>No because I like being alive and not insane.</br>  <br>Depends on the facility. I don't want to be be anywhere NEAR anything Keter or Euclid.</br>  <br>Would it be possible to clone 682 and have the two of them kill each other?</br>  SCP-085 is my waifu. <br>Best part is, she's 2D, which automatically makes her perfect, and if I dropped her into a manga, it's even better.</br>  <br>There are a fair many Euclid objects that are fairly innocuous, and a few Keter objects that are extremely predictable, and only pose a threat outside containment.</br>  <br>As some nameless mook?<br>Fuck that.</br></br>  <br>No.<br>One of the two 682s overpowers the other and eats it, becoming more powerful than ever.</br></br>  <br>No thank you. I'm in desperate need of a job. But not THAT desperate.</br>  <br>I used Cabin in the Woods as a reference to describe SCP to people. <br>It just sucks that a lot of people haven't see this movie. It's an interesting blend of comedy and horror.</br></br>  <br>No. There's always a chance that you'll encounter a SCP that has unknown effects that will fuck you up.</br>  <br>682 kinda reminds me of Primate Murder from the Nasuverse, except I guess 682's preferences are more varied.</br>  <br>That movie was one of the highlights of the year for me.</br>  <br> warehouse 13 <br>Fun show, but could do with better cast and better writers.</br></br>  <br>Maybe if I was a fucking superhero on a good salary. Those poor grunts at SCP are literally stormtroopers in SWAT gear.</br>  <br><br>Is the movie scary at all? I wanna watch it but I am horrible with jumpscares and tense moments.</br></br>  <br>Definitely, but I'm a fan of shows that have ordinary objects do strange and creative things so it was watchable.<br>Lost Room is one case of doing it very well. Shame it died so early.</br></br>  <br>The movie starts off in a way where you know its going to be a parody (somewhat). Its has more of a monster movie feel than an actual "scary" feeling. It just takes a 180 halfway through and goes full pic related. It's pretty great if you ask me.</br>  <br>Just watch it. It's better to go into it as unspoiled as possible.</br>  And of FUCKING COURSE THAT I'D SPEND 3 HOURS LOOKING AT SCP LINKS, AGAIN, BECAUSE OF THIS THREAD<br>FUCK YOU /a/</br>  <br>So true. Both the game and the users it draws in are shit.<br><br>Series 3 are mostly pretty good. Not on the hub yet, but there's a new canon which introduces Sarkicism, basically a sorcery cult and the Flesh (has ties with SCP-610, so you know how that goes) that the Church of the Broken God actively opposes. Really wellwritten and captivating, especially if you are into occult shit like me. Other canons in the hub seems to have gotten a lot bigger, but I've only started reading the wiki again recently, and not checked all of them out yet. Anyway, links: http://www.scp-wiki.net/metaphysici<wbr>an http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/meta<wbr>physician (the lowest part with "SITRA ACHRA" as the first tab)</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> You will never be a badass agent like Lombardi. <br> You will never be a badass driver like Dr. Gerald. </br></br>  the scp that's basically just a tape of a basketball game is one of my favourites. the concept seems so fucking stupid at first than quickly becomes fucking terrifying.<br><br>imagine being one of those poor digital copies with no way to escape your current situation. <br><br>anyway speaking of scp, I remember when i read it a while back some fucking cocksucker was busy editing some of the articles so that his faggy ass professor/doctor donut steel character showed up in it. is he still doing that?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Who was that guy? The name of that character, I mean.</br>  <br>166</br>  <br>I would immediately kill myself if I found out I lived in a world like that.</br>  <br>Don't worry, there's probably something that will make you kill yourself for you.</br>  <br>What if you are the SCP item and 4chan is the mean of quarantining you?</br>  <br>Once I reach page 10 I be free</br>  <br>1733, right? I'm a sucker for loopy-type skips, but SCP-1733 and SCP-176 dwarf all the others. 1733 for its fantastic concept, 176 for the awesome tales asscociated with it.</br>  <br> every humanoid SCP and animal SCP <br>Quite the sweeping generalization you've got there.<br><br> Of course it will never happen <br>It will never happen because there are enough votes from various fags to keep shitty articles from being deleted, authors notwithstanding. I suggest picking good scps from this site<br>http://scp-nala.wikidot.com/statist<wbr>ics:split-ratings</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But then you saw another thread that interest you and the cycle continues.</br>  <br><br>... You do know that's D territory right?<br><br>You just said "You'll never act out an atrocious crime against decency, nature, empathy, another sentient being and yourself, then be promptly liquidated for the next batch of expendables."</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>In a heartbeat.<br><br>I've got a bit of a martyr complex; I'm the exact kind of guy they wish they could have there.<br><br>I'd probably meet a bad end.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> machine that gives you any kind of drink you want. <br>Share and enjoy!</br></br>  <br>A cup of Joe, anyone?</br>  <br><br>The vending machines a favorite. Treats ranged from delightful and quirky to deadly and terrifyingly sickening.</br></br>  <br>SCP 040</br>  <br> Also, SCP anime would be great. <br>I agree.<br><br>Warehouse 13 sort of has a similar premise. Agents work to locate and secure artifacts that do weird things and are too dangerous to leave out and about.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno, knowing it'll end terribly like the movie doesn't sit well.</br>  <br>which movie?</br>  <br>The SCP movie, duh.</br>  <br>The Cabin in the Woods</br>  862 is actually pretty nice.  <br>862 is a safe class, of course it's nice.</br>  <br><br>I dropped it when the foundation killed the man-of-war. He was a fucking bro and they killed him because they're assholes like that.</br></br>  <br>The only reason I would be nervous about an SCP anime is because the cynic in me knows that they'd focus primarily on the humanoid SCPs and have them as the main characters.<br><br>If you're gonna make an SCP anime, it should be almost like a slice of life anime, with a different plot each episode, from the viewpoint of the D-class, taskforce soldiers, researchers, and RARELY an SCP. Also, the only recurring characters should be the shadowy 05 that you see maybe once every other episode.<br><br> And then have a major plot arc where everything goes to shit and they have to detonate the on-site nuke. </br></br></br></br></br>  I hate that everyone and their mother is expendable trash.<br><br>The foundation has their heads stuck so far up their ass that they are directly causing global warming because of their misplaced sense of duty.<br><br>They're removing everything that's fun and interesting about the world and are even hoarding beneficial items by outright robbing the original owners.<br><br>Fuck them and their glorified mafia organization.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck this :_;</br>  <br>who is this man-of-war?</br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/yUpbOliTHJY?t=7s  [ ]</br>  <br>Ah, but that's part of the fun. The SCP foundation is only concerned with preserving the well-being of the human race, at any cost.<br><br>Which is worse: Global warming, or a pot that spawns a never-ending army of monsters?<br><br>I like the SCP foundation because it's the extreme version of "To be good, sometimes you must be evil."</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's one of the scp's. It's a guy that has his fighting skills increase exponentially the better the weapon he is using.<br><br>A pocket knife is enough for him to fight an android on equal terms.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At least they are not GOC. Fuckers destroy anything they deem anomalous.</br>  <br><br>Meh, I was never fond of fucked up systems and societies. I'm pretty sure that way of thinking is going to bite them in the ass in the long run.</br></br>  <br>Ohhhh, that mary sue? Didn't they make him kill himself by  giving him an SCP sword that makes you a horrible fighter and he accidentally cut his own head off with it ?<br><br>I'm glad he's gone.</br></br></br>  <br>682</br>  <br> GOC <br><br>What's that?</br></br></br>  <br>Welp. No wonder he got wiped, the wiki doesn't take kindly to superhero-like character, and that's not saying much.</br>  <br>What's the alternative? Let those eldrith abomination bite humanity in the short run?</br>  MOOOOMMMMM the chuunis got out of their containment board!  <br>Global Occult Coalition<br>http://www.scp-wiki.net/goc-hub-pag<wbr>e (read the "About" tab)</wbr></br></br>  <br>The Global Occult Coalition<br><br>http://www.scp-wiki.net/groups-of-i<wbr>nterest#toc8<br><br>Imagine the SCP foundation, but instead of containing things, they try to kill them.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br>They've been living with/harassing humanity for thousands of years. The foundation is probably stifling human evolution by trying to contain them.<br><br>I say let the world have fun and interesting things once more.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>It's just a "lesser of two devils" thing. The Foundation is cold, not cruel.</br></br></br>  <br>They did nothing wrong. Abominations of nature should be purged.</br>  Fuck I read that as the Spurs Celtics Pistons broship.<br><br>Fuck /nba/. Just, fuck it.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure that you're post is the precisly the point behind some SCPs. Quite a few of them call into question whether or not the Foundation is actually doing the right thing.<br><br>That being said, there are definitely some SCPs that NEED to be locked away. Some are so powerful that they would destroy humanity with no chance of survival. Most Keter class objects come to mind. From there it becomes a slippery slope. How can you tell what SCPs can be let go and which have to be contained? These objects are so mysterious that you can't really measure their abilities to use as a basis for judgment.</br></br></br>  <br>Is 096 the humanoid who kills people who see its face?<br>They tried it already.<br><br>Because he has absolute plot armor.<br>They put him in a place where they fucked with the laws of physics in ways that they didn't even understand and it didn't work.<br>They put him in a story-made-real with an entity created with the explicit ability and desire to kill him, and it didn't work.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's ridiculous how some virtually invincible SCP's would willingly surrender themselves to the foundation and let themselves be locked-up indefinitely.  <br> Implying eldritch abominations are the only things anomalous in the foundationverse <br>There are plenty Safe scp object that do absolutely no harm to others. SCP-1609 is a chair that teleports to people in need of a seat, until they put it in a woodchipper, which turns it into a pile of splinters that teleport into people's lungs.</br></br>  <br>I can't think of a skip that fits your description, except SCP-343.</br>  GUYS GUYS. How do we  contain  Accelerator?  <br>That's because it's implied the ones running the organisation are not necessarily human, nor even of that world. Also quite likely the majority of the staff are under the effects of one or more SCPs without their knowledge.</br>  <br>Also the people taking part in it don't remember it either.</br>  <br> SCP-1609 is a chair that teleports to people in need of a seat, until they put it in a woodchipper, which turns it into a pile of splinters that teleport into people's lungs. <br>Oh my fuck.</br></br>  <br>Well, they have a girl who can warp reality by thinking about it contained by simply keeping her unconscious 24/7, so I'm sure they'd figure something out. Maybe try to get an undercover agent to spike his drink?</br>  I'd waifu the girl that secretes slime/acid through her akin, had to be taught English by the foundation, and eats by absorbing things like frogs through her skin.<br>Just need a full body condom.</br>  Why don't they just write "SCP-582 killed SCP-682"?  <br>It's certainly not an easy task. They may be forced to use an scp to contain him. Something mind-affecting could work, perhaps?</br>  <br>Why don't they just write "SCP-682 got tired of its bullshit and killed itself"?</br>  <br><br>This is why i don't like it when the Foundation (or rather the writers behind it) test SCPs with other SCPs. 682 works much better by itself, where it can truly be the ever adapting, impossible to kill crocodile. But once you start using other SCPs on it, the "hard to kill" becomes "easy to kill". Because lets face it, there's plenty of SCPs that could kill 682. like that one test with the bookend SCP. That should have worked. the only reason it didn't is because "no he's unkillable no matter what!"</br></br>  <br>The fight with the Korean esper girl was even more of a brown note. She was tearing it apart and then just fucking stopped. Or when God had a look at it and said it wasn't for him to fix.</br>  <br> 2015 <br> Still finding way to kill 682 <br>The consensus is SCP-682 will live, no matter how much of an asspull his method to survive is.<br>Asking "Wouldn't X kill 682?" has been a way to piss off users for like 4 years now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the consensus is that 682 is dead.<br>At least that's MY consensus.<br>God damn I really hate how prideful the users are on that website.</br></br></br>  Why deploy a tactical warhead in 076's containment if he can apparently be managed with just an explosive collar? Seriously, it seems like extreme overkill for no good reason.  <br> Also, SCP anime would be great. <br><br>By which studio?</br></br></br>  <br>KyoAni</br>  <br>That will be just borfest.<br>Let Shinbo direct it.</br></br>  <br>Here's a better idea. Rather than have a huge, complex containment site for him, why not just have his spawn point surrounded by industrial strength flamethrowers or some shit? Have them be weight sensitive so as soon as he spawns he gets roasted.</br>  <br>As an anthology series. Keter class type of cases by Madhouse, Bones,  Sunrise , the more subdued/ surreal ones by Shaft, safe, SoL by KyoAni.<br><br>Each episode will have Wakamoto as a Rod Serling type of open narration.</br></br></br>  <br>It's my headcannon that SCP-682 was created by some other reality-warping SCP and isn't actually just some strange mutant lizard.</br>  <br>Or they could just keep him sedated and restrained.</br>  <br>They could just flood his containment chamber with acid, like they did for 682. Even if he managed to swim to a wall and punch through a meter or two of reinforced steel even when submerged, he'd probably be halfway to looking like soup by the time he got out.</br>  <br>For quite some time they dont do cross-tests anymore, or rather discourage it.</br>  <br>Anything working under rules similar to Cendrillon's slipper curse in NT3 made him doubt his ability, so chances are that will work.</br>  <br>Yeah, that's how they are able to keep a relatively high quality in their site, instead of letting it devolves into "put your generic x-men, mary sues and other shitty self-inserts here" writing site. Many people see that as needlessly harsh and unwelcoming, but I think it's a pretty good thing.</br>  <br>True. The present scpwiki is very different from the old one, which sadly is still the foundation's image in the eyes of most people.</br>   put SCP-053 together with SCP-682 and leave them alone <br>Done. No more need to worry about how to kill the immortal scaly bastard.</br>  <br> Quite a few of them call into question whether or not the Foundation is actually doing the right thing. <br><br>Good thing about that ethics committee.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9Z0<wbr>YMJUaNrw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Terrific tale voiced by terrific guy.</br>  <br>I'm also fond of the UIU orientation, it's great at framing the various groups in the setting.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pmF<wbr>sI5eKvsw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>She stopped because she can never fully accomplish a task, and 682 asked her to kill it.</br>  Does ANYBODY know the original context behind this picture?  <br>I thought it was just subway/bridge graffiti art.</br>  <br>http://ja.scp-wiki.net/scp-series-j<wbr>p#001<br>Can anyone here read moonrunes, and tell which of the original Japanese SCPs do not steal is worthy of note?</br></wbr></br>  <br>I wanna see if they compare</br>  The short work contest produces some pretty cool shit. Format screws are my favorite.<br>http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2521</br>  I have a question:<br><br>Just what is SCP-001?</br></br>  <br>No one knows for sure. There are at least three options.</br>  <br>That fucker scares me like nothing else.</br>  <br><br>13, to be exact. There's also the possibility of them all being red herrings.</br></br>  <br>At least we know it came from /x/.</br>  <br>There are several possibilities<br>I'm partial to the Seraphim</br></br>  So is the game any good? This is important.  <br>They made a Keter SCP into an idol as her containment procedure.</br>  <br>Play and see for yourself. It's free.<br><br>I can see its appeal and the dev did a pretty good job, but it's still shit to me, like most horror games nowadays</br></br></br>  <br>As expected of Japan.<br><br>I'd think they would put most of their pop culture as SCPs, so I'd bet they have an SCP about a ghost girl in a videotape.</br></br></br>  This is how endless eight should have ended.<br><br>Prove me wrong.</br></br>  <br>FUUUCK<br>That SCP still fucks me up<br>One of the creepiest ones for me simply because of the images.</br></br></br>  Is it just me, or is this fanfiction-tier bullshit?<br><br>http://www.scp-wiki.net/incident-23<wbr>9-b-clef-kondraki</wbr></br></br>  Who /1004/ here?  <br>Everybody is.</br>  <br>Clef is the shittiest, yes.</br>  <br>Those 'incident' stories were made in a time of SCP history when really shitty SCPs would have stories written around them on how they got 'decmomissioned', usually involving some over-the-top story which was fun to read, like Duke 'Till Dawn. As SCP grew in popularity, shitty SCPs grew in number an the staff couldn't keep up with writing decommission stories.

The characters work well in a more humor based setting.</br></br></br></br>  <br> the very first thing the first Hokage says without knowing him at all is that Itachi is probably better than him. <br>Are you fucking serious?</br></br>  Best family.  <br>  needs more sunflower <br> and aunt and grandpa </br></br>  <br> Hinata  <br> strong </br></br>  <br> needs more sunflower <br>There is, to this day, zero animated footage of Himawari. Either she's just that damn cute that they have to keep her a secret, or she's the most irrelevant character in the movie.<br><br>Hopefully it's the former. At least we know she has a few speaking lines, though.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Judging from the spoilers it appears to be the latter.</br>    <br>nah, chouchou is the more irrelevant character in the movie<br><br>himawari's birthday plays an important part and she has 4 scenes with her family</br></br></br>  <br>is this from the trailer? it's too precious</br>  <br>It must have been awesome growing up in the Uzumaki family before Naruto became hokage if the family pictures are anything to go by.</br>  <br>it's a blown up, perspective corrected part of a background shot from one of the teasers.</br>  <br>yes</br>    <br> and aunt and grandpa <br><br>I woulnd't expect to see any of them anymore. They don't even get a cameo during the chunnin exam and the only relative that gets name dropped is Minato.</br></br></br>  <br>They probably filled the stands with random nobodies instead of sneaking in every character that survived to the end of the series. What a waste.</br>  <br>I don't blame Boruto at all if it is true he doesn't want to be Hokage by the end of the movie.<br><br>Naruto has to both be the cities mayor and personally assign every ninja a mission. That's crazy.<br><br>Hell if Naruto can barely keep up with the workload, imagine anyone else. I'd even say the Hokage position should be split what with the population explosion.</br></br></br></br></br>  Didnt Kishi start a mafia manga like years ago when he first announced Nuruto is ending?   there are people who believe that Boruto will EVER become hokage <br> there are people who dont realize that Sarada will be hokage </br>  <br>don't forget that they are in the middle of the chunnin exams and there's a kaguya level thread</br>  <br>One shot.</br>  <br>Then why does he want to be an edgy traveling hobo that would end up spending even less time with his family?</br>  <br>  son, be careful about what you're saying <br>  the last time somebody (salad's mom) went off on that tangent, we got sucked into some alternate dimension <br>  I didn't realize it at the time, but I almost got teenage raped by an alternate version of your mom </br></br></br>  <br>He says no such thing. He says he'll be like sasuke in that he'll support Sarada as Hokage.<br><br>This kid got to witness best-dad overworked to the point that it strained their relationship. To the point of falling asleep in overtime like a Japanese businessman.<br><br>Fuck that noise. Good luck with that shit, Sarada. Let's see how many clones she can make.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> if i hadn't been a retard back them I would have let her </br>  <br>The End of the last had footage of her.</br>  <br>Second time. Although he may have actually been telling the filler girl to shut up because she was ranting in the previous scene.</br>  <br>"How does naruto fuck you hinata?  It's so I know how to fuck pinkshit really! "</br>  <br>Does this count?</br>  <br>There seems to be a pattern developing here.</br>  <br>poor sauce, it really is too easy to see him as a closet case who got friendzoned by his oblivious socially stunted teammate.</br>  <br>Technically, they've all saved the world.</br>  <br> implying he was serious when he said that </br>  <br>Not really, otherwise he would have said yes to this.</br>  <br>I don't blame him. Nobody told him about his dad's past, so he doesn't really know what he's saying.</br>  Any of the current subs for The Last good (i.e. not barely passable ones)?  <br>Even Orochimaru is sweating hilarious<br>Is it me? Or Hashirama acts like Goku and Tobirama like Vegeta</br></br>  <br> I don't blame Boruto at all if it is true he doesn't want to be Hokage by the end of the movie <br>He doesn't. He wants to support Salad  from behind. </br></br>  <br>Looks decent. Might check it out.</br>  <br>at this point naruto was already solidly paired off, so it wasn't like sauce would have had any reasonable sense of hope.<br><br>he's merely a weirdo obsessed with restarting his clan who's at best the most asexual character in the cast.</br></br></br>  Wasn't that Big tree cit in half because of Naruto's Lava Rasenchuriken?<br>Why it looks complete in the movie? <br>Did the bad guys fix it or what?</br></br>  <br>Salad pls<br><br> Everybody knows he want to fuck you in the ass while you wear the hat. </br></br></br>  <br> B-b-but he wanted to clean his HONOUUUURSSS <br>Fucker like Gayra wanted naruto's dick since he was the only person liking him even if he didn't interpret it right.</br></br>  <br>what's salad gonna do when she figures out that burrito has no interest in a hokage for a partner after having an absentee dad due to the position's rigors?</br>  <br> Madara/Mito interaction <br><br>Madara actually name dropped her once while Hashirama never did.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a win/win scenario for him<br>  free to spend time with his beloved family <br>  sarada takes the hat, his dad is not as busy anymore <br>  he tells her he will support her when they are twelve, locking that pussy on lock <br>  sarada gets stuck with the soul sucking job while he is free to go buy cigarettes like sensei did <br><br>he's probably going to campaign for her to become the youngest hokage in history</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why it looks complete in the movie? <br>Different tree. We can assume Momo is collecting bijuu and chakra in an attempt to recreate it so he can get his own Chakra Fruit.</br></br>  <br> burrito has no interest in a hokage for a partner <br>probably not, but he has heavy interest in her for a partner</br></br>  <br>there were enough people after naruto's dick that his inaction can only be explained by some pretty deep psychological issues.<br><br>he's canonically an incredibly sneaky little fuck, so mere obliviousness has a hard time holding up.</br></br></br>  <br>Everyone in naruto is fucked up, after all is written by someone who compares his relation with his TWIN BROTHER as the relation between any of his two characters.<br><br>And all of those reek of homolust and brain problems(nurudo-sauce) or directly brain problems (itachi-sause).</br></br></br>  <br><br>Apparently at the end of the movie he goes a little overboard in saying how he wants to support and protect Salad, making her blush. <br><br>Oh well. Should serve as a nice deterrent. "Don't attack the Leaf village or else Mr. "I killed a god when I was 12" will come after your ass. And his two Jesus dads, too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>you'd expect konohamaru to still be in line, but after getting a good look at the shit his long-time "boss" has to deal with, he'd be better off dodging the responsibility.</br>   naruto starts <br> third hokage is called the strongest ninja of all time, also nicknamed ''god of shinobi'' <br>cue forwards<br> 4th hokage introduced <br> ''strongest ninja in the 3rd ninja war'' despite 3rd hokage and multiple other strong shinobi participating <br> hashirama and tobirama introduced properly <br> ''oh yeah disregard everything about powerlevels before because hashirama was way above everyone'' <br> ''and don't forget tobirama who was almost as strong as hashirama'' </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Have there been any more announcements other than the next four novels?

Early 20s or something, right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>he was 23 years old</br>  <br>Salad will probably have the job by the time she's 18.</br>  Someone who went to see Boruto drew the scenes.

Goddamn token events</br>  <br>Wow, two best girls mixed into one works surprisingly well.</br>  Honoka- Self-sacrificing leader who ascends into Godhood<br>Umi- A shy girl who is forced to become a warrior to save the one she loves<br>Rin- The Tomboy who became a hero but did not get the gratitude sex at the end.<br>Nozomi- The idealistic mentor with a short life span.</br></br></br>  <br>I agree. Best raibu and mai waifu as one is a good combo.</br>  <br>Maki is the lewdest.</br>  <br><br>That's the problem. You have to work your way up to the LP amount, starting from something low. So until you literally earn your 7-8 hours of sleep back by leveling to 100 in the game, which takes a few months btw, you'll be setting timers to grind out that LP so none of it goes to waste.<br> but anon I only wanna play it casually and i dont get addicted easil- <br>That's not how it fucking works. You're gonna set the timers, everyone does in the end.<br><br> If I recall correctly theres actually an update going on the 31st that halves the exp curve to 100 so it won't be as bad but still I do advise you to proceed with caution </br></br></br></br></br></br>  When will Honoka and Haruka join forces to combat a greater evil.  HONK    <br>Honk</br>        <br>Honk</br>      <br>If all you're trying to do is clear events, it's more than easy to do that with a full night sleep so long as you don't let it slack during the day. I was able to do one of the recent score competition events at like 45 max LP and while working a full time job just by taking a break once a day and not letting it sit at max for too long at any other times. <br><br>The token events aren't as easy though, and if you're looking to get T2 you're going to have to spend love gems no matter what, they just get more efficient at higher levels.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The only thing stopping me is the fact that my phone sucks ass. It can't even handle Hard mode without occasional drops.</br></br>  <br>I do 9 hour days with an hour break, so the 4 hour chunks are perfect for LP refill.<br><br>It's still suffering though, my life is under control.</br></br></br>  I love Honoka!  <br>Isn't it great?</br>  Madoka <br>4.00 → 8.6 → 12.3 → 14.9 → 16.7 → 17.8 → 18.4 → 19.3 → ??.? → 20.2 → ??.? → 20.6 (final 2.08 billion)<br>Love Live <br>4.00 → 8.3 → 11.9 → 14.8 → 16.5 → 18.5 → 20.7<br><br>Should pass Madoka Magica before the current weekend even starts, if not the weekend will easily carry it beyond. If this gets any sort of English news coverage the shitstorm should be pretty amusing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Apparently today's box office take has put it over Madoka so now it's only a matter of seeing where the new late night anime movie record is going to end up. Some people argue it has the potential to go beyond 3 billion yen, but I think 2.5 billion is a more realistic expectations.</br></br>  <br><br>So does this just end after you beat all the first years or is something else supposed to happen?</br></br>  <br>Fix version.</br>  <br><br>Wait Emi Nitta is actually an eroge seiyuu? I suppose that makes sense in a way.</br></br>  <br>My raibus stronk</br>  <br>Nanjo also did eroge.

I have about 900 flowers saved up though, I'm gonna blow through them all on the last day.</br></br>  <br>is there any difference between playing the x4 one and 4 of the regular ones?</br>  <br>I'm gonna just farm flowers and try to burn through them all on the last day as well. It's that or try to earn 2200 points a day which is pretty much impossible for me.</br>  <br>I have no flowers right now but I'm on track to grab Kot just before the deadline. Got two days off between now and then, too.</br>  <br>You won't get anything for the first 3 events since you level and team are low.<br><br><br>4x the event point but not 4x experience. You use that when you are sick of Kotori's train.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kotori's train is cute.<br><br>This is the second event that's been on since I started and I'm on track for getting Kotori, so you're wrong there.</br></br></br>  <br>right, I forgot about the exp thanks</br>  <br><br>I got Nozomi and she was my second event. But I can't idolize her, which is a bit sad.</br></br>  <br>I was thinking more going to tier 2 so you can idolize the event card.</br>  <br>You're pretty fucked m8. 180 flowers on hard gives a little under 900 event points, translating to basically 200 flowers per 1000 points. You basically need another 1000 flowers in the next three days to make it (I'm not much better, I've been at it from the beginning and only 2k points and 900 flowers).</br>  <br>Are you guys just not playing? I've been pretty lax and my team is fucking awful. not even managing to reach A-rank on Normal and yet I'm at 8500pts.</br>  When I first started I didn't even try to get the event SR rewards, I just focused on getting better teams. By the 5th or so event I was able to get one of them, but I had to use like 20 love gems or so since my LP was still so low and I wasn't getting as many point off a song. Nowadays I can pretty much get the reward without having to spend a single gem, but if you miss even a dare or so you're pretty much going to have to. Also I've never really attempted to rank high enough to get a second SR Rare and the idolized version since it seems like you'd either need a ton of gems or have to spend some money to buy enough to do it and then just play non-stop doing only hard songs. You can't even use the 4x song since they don't count towards your rank so there's no taking shortcuts really.<br><br>My strategy is usually to play only expert songs, which at Rank 100 you can just do 3 in a row, refill, 3 in a row refill, and then pretty much just do one more and then you can do a 4x song. If it's the 7 days of the event I just try to save up as much as I can and not spend any Love Gems. If it's getting down to the wire at the end when I'm spamming the 4x songs then I'll start using some Love Gems and measuring out the recharge time.</br></br>  <br><br>It's ridiculously close though, like less than 5,000 away. Once 2nd Season gets it's re-release it should pass it unless Madoka gets it's first. The movie BD will almost certainly outpace Madoka's too. If one volume of Gundam Unicorn was enough to do it last year I don't see why Love Live can't.</br></br>  <br><br>Sunrise is so unfair. They have so many records already and the Madoka and Bakemonogatari BD runs were like SHAFTs one claim to fame in it's entire history and they took so many of it's records away. Best single BD volume sales, best late night anime movie gross. They'll still have that TV series BD average thing, but they'll literally never hit anywhere close to those sorts of numbers ever again be it Monogatari or otherwise whereas there's always a good chance Sunrise's next smash hit is just around the corner.</br></br>  <br><br>People complain now but they'll be all over the Kurosawa sisters by the time it's out I'm sure, especially Dia.</br></br>  <br><br> Thanks for that</br></br>  It's easy getting the event SRs as long as you don't waste too much lp.<br><br>Suppose your team is shit and only gets C every EX event song.

Love Live will pass either number in any case regardless.</br></br>  <br><br>I have absolutely no fucking clue. Up until it become evident that Love Live was going to pass it 2.08 billion has been the number I've seen quoted for Madoka Rebellion over and over on both sides of the Atlantic. Now I'm suddenly hear anything from 2.25 Billion to even 2.3 billion though based on what I don't know. Goalpost moving damage control by the sounds of it.</br></br>  <br><br>I've also seen 1.93 billion and 2.06 billion yen quoted as Madoka Rebellions final tally as well so who the fuck knows anymore where people are getting their numbers from. The most believable and plausible one that has any actual evidence though is the 2.08 marker as listed by the Motion Picture Association of Japan on their official 2013 box office gross rankings.<br><br>http://www.eiren.org/boxoffice_e/20<wbr>13.html<br><br>Keep in mind that's for Japanese films only.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I remember when they were matching Kyoani release for release during that studios heyday and greatest period of success in the latter half of the 2000's and then kind of did the same to SHAFT. There really is a casual feel to it though. Like oh you release Haruhi, well we counter with Gundam 00, oh you're going Clannad After Story, here's this thing called Code Geass. Haruhi movie? Awaken the Trailblazer! What's a Hyouka, we have this thing called Tiger and Bunny where the main character is a 30 something down on his luck kind of guy. What do you mean it'll never fly? <br><br>Monogatari series? Unleash the Beast of Possibility! Madoka Magica? Zenkai no Rabu Raibu!!! <br><br>It just seems to go on like this throughout the decades, but what's most fucked up is that other than Gundam Unicorn (though arguably it is their franchise still, just that it started as a novel) they tend to do this all from scratch building from the ground up while other studios routinely make there hits by taking someone else external from the companies idea and putting their own spin on it. The only counter example really is Madoka, Shaft did do that from scratch though they had a metric fuck ton of help from Aniplex and Nitroplus.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Since people were talking about the game, it sucks. Wasted 70 loveca to try and get a Hanayo but ended up with rares, two Makis, and a Rin which was nice to improve my teams but not what I wanted.  <br>The game knows what your favorite raibu is and will not give it to you.</br>  <br><br>Tell me about it. I'm on the hunt for Nozomi, but I get a lot of Eli and Umi.</br></br>  <br>How so? Besides I can't read nip.</br>  <br> took me 3 rolls just to get a single rare Nozomi <br> first non-welfare UR I get is Nozomi <br>It's a love-hate kind of thing.</br></br></br>     tfw you pull 2 rares in a row from normal scouting   <br>Every time I try to roll for a UR Maki, the game cucks me with a UR Nico instead.</br>  <br>Memorize the menus in the english version and then play it on JP. That's what I did.</br>  <br>I meant more like the story stuff, I don't want to cross reference a wiki each time a new chapter unlocks.</br>  <br>Oh you actually care about the story. Then I can't help you.</br>  <br>You have to wait one year before you can roll for burd cop.</br>  <br>That is pretty tempting.</br>  I start to have decent teams. Specially the smile one.  tfw one of Honk's Nendos comes out on my birthday.  You'll notice a Honk in this picture if you watch closely.    <br>With something being released every month from August to October, it is becoming likely we will not be getting a 7th µ's MV this year.<br><br>On another note, I hope the first single comes with a Aqours MV.</br></br></br>  <br>https://wiki.puella-magi.net/Puella<wbr>_Magi_Madoka_Magica_the_Movie:_Rebe<wbr>llion#Box_Office_-_Domestic<br><br>It's based on this table where the 'final' tally is quoted as 2.25 billion.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  I enjoy u's dressed up like K-Idols  <br>Ever doing something that's not Eli?</br>  <br><br>I have Kotori and Maki as Eli's partner in crime</br></br>  <br>Pretty</br>  <br><br>Funny thing, the cover i had asked for inspiration from looked WAY too similar. my animu waifu Has bled into real life.<br><br>Maybe Umi would be ok wearing this</br></br></br></br>  <br>unf</br>  <br> https://wiki.puella-magi.net/Puell<wbr>a_Magi_Madoka_Magica_the_Movie:_Reb<wbr>ellion#Box_Office_-_Domestic</wbr></wbr> <br><br>So they trust some fan wiki with a clear biased interest towards Madoka Magica over the official MPAJ quote? That's our Crunchyroll news. Out of legitimate curiosity though where did the fan wiki pull that number from cause the source link it posts just goes to a page talking about the iDOLM@STER movie from 2014.</br></br></br>  <br>It's been a while since the MM movie. I'm guessing that page has been updated and the information can be found on a internet wayback machine.</br>   Love Live! Μ's Go → Go!
