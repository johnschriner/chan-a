[ That orbital strike was a thing of beauty.<br><br>Yuhata's the bomb.</br></br>  <br>I might have been a mostly anime-original content episode, but man was it done right.<br><br>Didn't really fuck with the story at all, expanded a bit on the characters and their motivations, added some cool scenes in, and left ample material for a season 3.<br><br>Great way to finish up the season.</br></br></br></br></br>  Season 3 pls Polygon.   UCHIKUDAKEEEEEE comes back for the credits roll   <br>SEASON THREE FUCKING WHEN?<br><br>I SWEAR I NEED MORE, DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE TELL ME THAT RECAP AT THE END WITH OP1 MEANT CLOSURE FOR THE SERIES</br></br></br>  No Yuhata being stoked for you.<br><br>I never asked for this.</br></br>  <br>Anime Lem IX isn't filled with creepy gauna bugs and creatures but instead a lot of gauna hairy balls. But if Polygon only has this much money to animate balls and comes up with a cool way to exterminate them all in one swoop then I'm fine with that.</br>  <br>Happy Izana is the best Izana, after all those sufferings.</br>  <br>There was that one creepy as fuck motherfucker that chased Izana and the other dude though.</br>  Too bad tsunbot didn't make it this season.<br><br>Although, that might have been a good thing. S3, if there ever was going to be a S3, would be harem shit.</br></br>  Is Season 2 going to be on Netflix? dubbed too?  <br>This fourth of July, yes. You can't have enough of JYB and Sheh.</br>  <br>I don't think there is enough content</br>  <br>Content is not an issue, I can certainly wait a couple of years before a new season, but it's the fact of not knowing if there'll be another season plus the uncertainty that's left by that recap of both seasons at the very end that make me want to kill myself.</br>  <br> I don't think there is enough content <br>Really? If you are being sarcastic to the kid, it's difficult to tell.<br><br>I mean, fuckin' really? Not enough content?</br></br></br></br>  <br>There is, but the current arc in the manga needs to be finished first.</br>  <br>It's more of Polygon wants to end its 2-years planned anime properly first, then considers future projects later.</br>  <br>They're peeing in this scene right?</br>  <br>Which episode was that scene in?</br>  <br>Pretty sure this is just the catheters going in.<br><br>It's probably not a super comfortable experience.</br></br></br>   Nagate got some of that nice Gauna mouth in him. <br>I'm jealous.</br>  <br>Man, the ass design of the female models is so fucking perfect, literally the best ass ever</br>  <br>Not really true. They got a lot of the harem shit out of the way this season.</br>  <br>Post piss drinking</br>  It's such a good time to be a Captainfag.  <br>Ep 1 or 2 of season 1</br>  I don't fucking care if Izana and Tsugumi fags are dominating these threads, but I FUCKING MISS HOSHIJIRO. All those flashes of her at the final ED continues to remind me how much I like her. She is such sincere person and actually had skills too. I wish Nihei brings her PERSONALITY back as I don't believe she can be alive in anyway. I don't even care if she doesn't win the Tanikazebowl, I just want to see her smile again.<br><br>Goddamn it.</br></br>  <br>Have you not noticed how goddamn loud the animeonly Hoshijirofags have been lately? They're almost drowning out the Tsumugifags.</br>  <br>Lately is not when I've been around. Almost means they're not the loudest either.</br>  <br> they're not the loudest <br>So? I'm just pointing out that they have a presence like everybody else. They're not some poor oppressed group.</br></br>  don't mind me, just being best girl  So how well does Sidonia do in Japan?  <br>So the battle will still go on. How can the rest of assault fleets achieve anything with all casualties at this point?<br><br>Death to Smoogy would be entertain to watch though.</br></br></br>  <br>Which unfortunately was completely forgotten minutes later. Everyone seems to now assume the planet secured.</br>  Why?  <br>I'm curious about this myself.</br>  <br>We're probably going to see Izana and the rest of the recon fleet show up soon, so they should at least have the numbers to retreat without getting completely BTFO. I'm also betting on Tsumugi dying either protecting Izana or as she and Nagate watch helplessly.</br>  <br>She'll come back.</br>  <br>How many times is she gonna die?</br>  The end is near.  What does this mean?  <br><br><br><br>I guess that kinda answers it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The second Chimera</br></br>  <br><br>Have you read the manga? <br><br>Did you watch the finale in its entirety? It was quite literally staring you in the face.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying the ride will end </br>  <br>It's going to have a direct continuation sequel with the more accurate title 'Moe Alien Penis Monster of Sidonia'.</br>  <br> not Toxine's Tiny Sewer Adventure <br><br>0/10 wouldn't read</br></br></br>  <br>Personally I'd prefer 'Tit-Growing Suffering Cyborg Tales' but we can't always have what we want. Nihei is making fucking sure of that.</br>  All smiles here. <br><br><br><br>Oh, right. My bad.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What's the maximum possible suffering at this point that ensures all waifufags pull their hair out?</br>  <br>Watching her heart shatter into tiny pieces after she sees Tsumugi, Yuhata and the Captain fucking Nagate at the same time.</br>  <br>Probably homo end with Kunato, but that's letting fujoshis have a completely random win so it's not a good idea.</br>  <br>This. The reaction was bad enough when Tsumugi had a poorly foreshadowed pull ahead.</br>  <br>Funded.</br>  <br>So if izana detatched the head from the body, what was tanikaze sitting in?</br>  What chapter would you guys guess the manga will end on? I think around 90.  <br>All the waifus die. Nagate marries a genderbent clone of himself.</br>  <br>Toxine wins the Nagatebowl.<br><br>She isn't even interested in him so that would piss off EVERYONE.</br></br></br>  <br>100 views of Sidonia.</br>  <br>wait has the manga ended already? shouldn't there be a huge overhead for this?</br>  <br>Completely forgot about.How many sights have we seen so far?</br>  <br>I bet Nihei is dragging this shit just so he can have those 100 sights to compile as a special color booklet later on.</br>  <br>no it hasnt</br>  <br><br>Season 3's an eternal curse.<br><br>From Haruhi to Spice and Wolf then to Horizon etc. etc. all never get season 3. It's like an unwritten rule somewhere to never do season 3.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did he get gauna aids?</br>  Polygon you better have enough sales so you give us a season 3.  Did I remember correctly but is that smiling Hoshijiro in the MAD/ED actually Tsumugi? I don't think that has been shown in the anime yet? Flag for season 3?  Yep, sexually frustrated.<br><br><br>His cockpit you stupid fucking communist. <br><br><br>Placenta is uninhabitable to STIs. All good.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She planted an egg.</br>  <br>He simply came.</br>  <br>No, but he did get a ahegao.</br>  <br> Meanwhile at High School DxD. </br>  <br> his cockpit <br><br>then how was he flying the ship if the cockpit was detached?</br></br></br>  <br>Were they going for a corrupted version of the standard shoujo manga flowers-blooming-lace-frame-sparkly<wbr>-romance-scene thing here?</wbr></br>  <br>And it was mediocre at best. You want to sully the greatness of those series with a mediocre 3rd season?</br>  <br>I like the space flower ebolaids vagina flowers</br>  <br>Would you stop being a retard already?</br>  <br>This fucking moron</br>  <br>Why wont Kouichi submit his male urges on her?</br>  <br>I blame pilot episode special numbers<br><br>usually when a TV show, particularly cartoons gets its air, they get 26 pilot episodes or some where around 26. Spice and wolf had 25 I believe, 12 in S1, 13 in S2</br></br></br>  <br>Outlaw Star had 26 episodes aswell, and never saw a season 2. The 26th episode ends with "Tune in next time...!" but there never was one</br>  <br>Tsuruuchi aside, females are the only ones to have a strong libido in sidonia.</br>  <br>It's not being called a cockpit for no reason.</br>  <br> Oh fuck my robot is infected! <br> quick detach the cockpit! <br> detach the cockpit <br> how do I fly ship if cockpit is not attached? </br></br></br></br>  <br> High School DxD <br> Greatness <br><br>When did this happen?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll spell it out for you. The cockpit isn't in the head.<br><br><br>I was jesting, f-for real!</br></br></br></br>  <br>It didnt unless you have shit standards.</br>  <br> tune in next time! <br> there never was a next time <br>;_;<br><br> 1999 was 15 years ago </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean, if you are spending all of your time fighting placenta, you might not want to make very meaningful relationships.<br><br>Look what happened to Akai</br></br></br>  <br> The cockpit was detached <br>Come on, guardians are the same basic shape as every giant robot ever.</br></br>  <br>Then if tanikaze is sitting in the cockpit<br><br>and they told him to detach the cockpit to stop the guana from infectin him further<br><br>and he detached the cockpit<br><br>and the head flies off the body<br><br>but the head is not the cockpit<br><br>how does detaching the head stop the guana from infecting the body?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What Izana detached was the head, not the cockpit. The gauna was finding its way in via the damaged head.</br>  <br>then why even have a head on the body?</br>  <br> detach the cockpit <br><br>Pretty sure they didn't say that.</br></br></br>  <br>The head is the hyggs cannon.</br>  <br><br>jesus christ how retarded can you be</br></br>  <br>Cause it looks cool and you can't see out of your chest.</br>  <br><br>They never say detach the cockpit. They say to close the head airlock or something. The Gauna tentacles are getting in through the head/neck area. The cockpit is in the chest region, (which you would know if you had been paying any attention to the show and/or manga). Jettisoning the head and sealing the airlock in the neck area severed the tentacles connecting the placenta in the cockpit from the body of Benisuzume, <br><br>Fuck anon you are retarded.</br></br></br></br>  <br>when was the last time that nigga used that higgs cannon before he got the gun?</br>  <br>Don't even think of it as a head. Think of it as a cannon. It serves practical mechanical functions for the gardes. It's not a piece of eye candy.</br>  <br>They use it constantly. It helps eat through placenta, as well as being easier to keep on target than the railgun.</br>  <br>Do you even watch the show? Stop acting retarded.</br>  <br><br><br>why is the cockpit in the body and not the head? put the cockpit in the head then the cannon in the body and it'd be better and like stuff</br></br></br>  <br>the bleach is above the dryer</br>  <br>Cut the head and the placenta is cut from the main body.</br>  <br> why is the cockpit in the body and not the cock? it'd make way more sense if it was in the cock because its a cockpit </br>  <br>Why would they put the cockpit in the head?</br>  <br> cockpit in a small, outer part instead of a bulky center part <br> better </br></br>  <br>so he can see out the top of the body so he can turn the head and see everything, like instead of being stuck looking out the chest and not being able to just rotate a bit to look behind you<br><br> wah what was that? <br> turn head around <br> wah what was that? <br> turn entire body around to look at it </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why is the pilot in the cockpit? put the pilot in Sidonia and turn the robot into a big gun and it'd be better and like stuff </br>  <br>I'm dying of laughing here.</br>  <br>why not just pilot the guard from the ship like a remote drone so sidonia can stop losing pilots to stupid shit like putting the cockpit in the body</br>  <br>The camera's connected to he head, not the cockpit.</br>  <br>can mods ban people for being complete dumbasses?</br>  <br> guard </br>  <br> Why even have people? why not just make everyone a robot and give them guns and it'd be like better and stuff </br>  <br>I don't know what's he's been smoking, but I want some.</br>  You guys are being rused hard.  <br>then how does he see out of the cockpit when they detached the head? how does he pick up tsumogi and fly back to the ship without the camera on the head?</br>  <br> woah anon, you know drugs are bad for you </br>  <br><br>Holy shit anon. You are either the most hilarious troll in the history of Sidonia threads or the least observant moron in the history of Sidonia threads. <br><br>No one is looking out some little hole in the chest or something. It's all screens and cameras and VR. The pilots have a near 360 degree view from inside the cockpit but it's all projected images from sensors and whatnot.<br><br>I'm about to piss my pants laughing at you.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Guardians only have one camera </br>  <br>Ruse or not, I like to believe people in this day and age can still be genuinely retarded. It's more fun to live your life without doubting anything you see.</br>  <br> making excuses for bad anime design <br><br>this is why shit like this doesn't work<br><br> wow the head is important <br> dump the head <br> the camera was in that <br> I can still see fine <br> lemme pick up this bubblegum girl and bring her back to the ship <br> without a head <br> but I can still magically see </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only Izanafags are being rused hard.</br>  <br>SZS managed it.<br><br> Ending OVA never  ;_;  </br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather Izana get fucked hard.</br>  Also where does sidonia get its gravity if its in orbit around the planet and the total force upon the people in the sidonia is zero because the gravity is counter acted by the centripetal force  <br>leave</br>  <br>They buy it at space-Walmart.</br>  How do people photosynthesize with artifical light from fluorescent light? thats not how photosynthesize works  <br>Think about it this way. There are cameras in the head. He can see through the point of view of the head of the frame while being protected in by the toughness of the body. <br><br>So he gets the benefits of being in safest part of the frame while being able to view his surroundings intuitively from head cameras.</br></br></br>  <br>It's the future, they can probably recreate sunlight, they ain't gotta explain shit.</br>  <br>How do people not feel the massive recoil of firing a space gun out of the sidonia when it fired that big cylindrical can at a guana?</br>  <br>How do people photosynthesize without chloroplats? the people aren't green.</br>  <br>Big space pillows.</br>  Where do the people of sidonia make sugar from photosynthesizing if they don't breath in carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen (which is the chemical mechanism for photosynthesizing)<br><br>excessive oxygen makes photosynthesis impossible without carbon dioxide and glucose can't be made without carbon dioxide</br></br>  <br>Space plant people don't have to be green.<br><br>They're using special space light.</br></br></br>  <br> What are backup cameras <br> What are redundant systems </br></br>  <br>Space photosynthesis.</br>  <br>Space-Walmart also sells shock-dampeners, which work to some extent.<br><br><br>It's the future, they integrated chloloplats without the need for green.<br><br><br>It's the future, they invented super photosynthesis which works different altogether.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I think these are good questions  but read the manga right?   Nagate bang Samari when?  <br>Next tuesday.</br>  So if I haven't read the manga can i hop in on the chapter where the anime left off and be able to continue with the story or should I read from the beginning?  <br> Space plant people don't have to be green. <br>chloroplasts are green because that frequency of light absorbs light best so that the plant can better utilize proper light frequencies that help the acceleration of glucose production.<br><br>ergo, sidonia people can do photosynthesis without carbon dioxide, without proper light sources and without being green to absorb light properly<br><br>so they've got a quadruple double edged sword whamy and they're doing the worst and least efficient photosynthesis ever.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>when season 3 happenes</br>  <br>It's better to start from chapter one. They've changed a few things around.</br>  <br> chloroplasts are green because that frequency of light absorbs light best <br>I thought they're green because that's the frequency that they don't absorb so it gets reflected (hence why you can see it)</br></br>  <br>Same as every other time this is asked, start from the start.</br>  <br>They did</br>  <br>All right thanks<br><br><br>I'm just hoping one time I won't have to<br>I'm still fucking reading TG, shit moves so slow once you know the gist of every arc</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and if their super shitty photosynthesis reaction is so stupidly inefficient then what purpose does the pancreas even serve if the sugar this shitty process is producing is being insulinated to the cells through that<br><br>its like everyone on board has proven hypoglycemia with type 2 diabetes, malnutrition and hypertension all the while having Gender Identity Disorder and Autism<br><br><br>Yes because Green color frequency is bad for glucose production and less efficient than other color spectra. Ergo any other color but green is ok.<br><br>All of them being white on board literally reflects all the colors of light and makes photosynthesis really really impossible at that point. Since white is a conjunction of all the colors and reflects them as such</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>With Sidonia you can play 'spot the differences' though. And there's a few of em.</br>  <br>Don't watch this show, it has really really bad thermodynamic 4th wall breaking physics shit<br><br><br> its like everyone on board has proven hypoglycemia with type 2 diabetes, malnutrition and hypertension all the while having Gender Identity Disorder and Autism <br>Sidonia is literally a Tumblr Seed ship.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sidonia is literally a Tumblr Seed ship. <br>this is what Nihei intended</br></br>  <br>I watched both fucking seasons as they aired and liked them thank you very much..</br>  <br>That would make it anime of the century. Kunato is clearly best boy and hottest Sidonia.</br>  <br>That's a funny way to spell Seii.</br>  <br> Kunato is clearly best boy and hottest Sidonia. <br>no that's brochiai and Sei</br></br>  <br>I think they captured the feel of the scene quite nicely. It was not ever intended to be as romantic as you seem to have perceived it.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Lets Recap<br><br>The guards have a cockpit, but the cockpit is in the head, not really its just a camera, the camera is in the head and detaching the head lets you still see through the cockpit which is in the chest now. The cockpit is in the chest and he can still see out like he normally would.<br><br>There is special gravity bought from space-walmart. The sidonia absorbs massive recoil through space pillows. People on sidonia are the epitome of Tumblr. People on sidonia have the worst chemical set up for photosynthesis by using fluorescent light, no carbon dioxide, no green layer absorbing materials and everyone has hypoglycemia because of it. Their skin is white which reflects any light energy they could get for photosynthesis, they breath oxygen which stifles glucose production, they exhale carbon dioxide which is where they should get their fuel source from to make glucose. Also they have gender identity disorder and autism.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also Guana are made of Women's Uterus linings (placenta)<br><br>And the people on the ship actively practice eugenics</br></br></br>  <br>And the perceived economic system of sidonia is totalitarian communism</br>  <br><br> Sei <br>He doesn't have Kunato's luscious hair.<br><br> Brochiai <br>Body deformation is gross but Koyasu makes it better, I'll give you that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just so the message get's across. begin from ch 1</br>  <br> Kunato Development <br> part of communism <br>it's obviously space fascism</br></br></br>  <br>Brochiai is canonically the best male sidonia</br>  <br>No one pays for it, its just developed and instantly deployed</br>  <br>seems about right</br>  <br>fascism is the merging of state and business. Are you surprised that they work so efficiently at deploying new tech?</br>  Tanikaze, pilot among pilots.  <br>Let's not forget that Izana is officially the most fuckable thing in Sidonia, all genders want a piece of her.</br>  <br> Completely fucked <br> Puts down anchor and goes for a last stand <br> Completely annihilates hundreds of gauna <br>Holy shit, how can he be this good of a pilot. Why not just give him the most advanced shit and let him solo everything.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's literally what they end up doing</br></br>  <br>That's exactly what they do. Izana to an extent as well, since in the manga she's actually a really good pilot.</br>  <br>So why did the Captain send the ace pilot, the only hope of they ever defeating the gauna, to rescue some rookies which were obviously mean to be cannon fodders anyway?</br>  <br>It was better explained in the manga. Tsumugi was probably going to hulk out if Izana was killed, and you don't keep an ace pilot on side by ordering him to not go save his best and pretty much only friend.</br>  Am I the only tard that cheered all the way from Hayakaze's orbital bombardment till the end song?<br>This anime is a great work of art with cinematographies never seeing in other animes.<br><br>I don't even care its CG anymore.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Because Tanikaze does whatever the fuck he wants because he's the ace pilot, that's why</br></br>  <br>So why was Izana picked for the mission anyway?</br>  <br>She might have judged that the fleet was in more dire need of strong aid. Since Sidonia is still around, she judged correctly.</br>  <br>Because Tsumugi and Tanikaze are personally invested in one of the Garde's pilots and Kunato helps usher on Kobayashi</br>   muh eurobeat <br> muh dagumi <br> muh shitbox Corolla <br>Face it, Wangan Midnight is superior in every single way. It has better cars, better characters and character development, better rivals, better battle scenes, and better plot progression.

And I'm japanese.</br>  <br> Wangan Midnight is superior in every single way. <br>American spotted.</br></br>  <br>Why, because it's superior highway battles?

I heard good things but I'm not entirely sure.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The story is absolute shit beyond belief. It should be called Autism Midnight. Every single character in Autism Midnight, unsurprisingly, is autistic.</br>  The animation style makes me sick, it's so bland. Proportions are off too.  <br>It makes sense, because you have to autistically obsess over cars that much to make machines that perfect.

I watched literally over 25 animes in my life, including masterpieces like Naruto and DAiry Tale. You guys know nothing about anime or japanese culture.</br>  <br> Attack on Titan is the best anime ever made. <br><br>Is it now?<br> Then where's the ending? </br></br></br></br>    Attack on Titan is the greatest anime of all time. I just finished the first season, and there is not one objective flaw contained within it. <br><br>Now to give some background, I'm a very picky anime watcher. I usually ignore 95% of the garbage that comes out, but this show really stands out among the rest. <br><br>Why am I making this thread you may ask? Well I've been lurking here for a few days and noticed that its really popular to have unpopular and contrarian opinions. I suppose I'd give you all a bit of what a self-made expert has to say and teach you all that something isn't bad just because it's popular.<br><br>Thank you for your time</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It never ends, because the real "Attack On Titan" is something that you experience outside of the episode. It's in your head that you live what the show offers, it becomes one with your soul and your very essence. To end AOT is to end life itself.</br>  <br><br><br>Kids these days.<br> Go watch Legend of Galactic Heroes, spermlings. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I've only watch SAO and Danmachi, Kekkai Shounen and Fate is shit, beat that pleb</br>    The Bait is Real  <br>Kek, look at that graphic and sound quality.

Discuss.                <br>Cute as fuck<br><br><br>I don't like this one, Papi isn't retarded. She just forgets things.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The real question is, what would she play? For some reason, I imagine her playing the handbells.</br>  <br>Triangle, cowbell, clapping, singing "la la la" or the song that never ends</br>  Just a little over a week.  <br>Oh shit, even more new images? Is that all of them?</br>  <br><br>I will never get over how cute this is.</br></br>  <br><br> Papi isn't retarded. <br><br>That's pretty debatable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>When is going to air the ATX version?</br>  <br><br> Animated-Miia actually has the proper amount of length and mass to her tail. </br></br>  <br>From July 7, every Tuesday 24: 30 ~ repeat broadcast: every Thursday 4:30 p.m. to 17:00 　　　　　　　every Sunday 20:30 to 21:00 　　　　　　　every Monday 8:30 to 09:00</br>  <br>GET HYPE</br>  <br>Miia best cuddler</br>  <br>Can't wait for animeonlyfags and people claiming waifus to start flooding the threads.</br>  <br><br>We've waited so long for this day, someone to take the pain away. No fan will ever have to say, we'll never get an anime!</br></br>  <br>Papi signing would be cute.<br> Because I'm Papi! <br> Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof! <br> Because I'm Papi! </br></br></br></br>  Zombina's the best  <br>For some reason I think Miia would fit a lot better as an idol singer than a DJ. I really can't see her as a club music or hip hop kind of girl.</br>  Anyone knows what does it says here?    <br> Current points <br> World/overall rank <br> Papi(or your girl, for others) rank. <br><br>Below that is world top three, followed by your girl's top three.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hnnnnggggh</br>  <br>Yoj got brain problems, son.</br>  <br><br>Miia's cute little efly-ears almost look a little too narrow and pointy in these screen-shots compared to the Manga.</br></br>  <br>thanks</br>  <br>I hope it will be as funny as the manga.<br><br><br>I would choose Lala if she were available. It would be even better if the other girls outside the harem were available too</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then I would need even more accounts.</br>  <br>A drawfag should draw Cerea with the Megamilk T-shirt on. Blushing of course.</br>  Why does papi's ass fluctuate in size like someone's panic paper bag?  Did anyone find where the web shorts are on the nip site?  <br><br>Is anybody else disappointed that Cera doesn't continually produce milk, unlike the Minotauress?<br><br>I totally wouldn't mind milking her if she were my waifu.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm o'k with her not having milk all the time. Just means you can only milk her at special times(when having new born Centaur baby) PLus it makes it more special when the baby goes to sleep and you get your fill of milk strait from the tap.</br>  <br>Human milk tastes horrible and I assume that since she has human breasts she has human milk.</br>  <br><br>Cathyl also has human breasts and they say her milk tastes amazing.</br></br>  <br><br> Human milk tastes horrible <br><br>......How would you know that?.....</br></br></br></br>  <br>Experience</br>  <br>Mero said it was thick. Since Mero knows lewd I'll take her word for it.</br>   Tio, sweety, you can't take the dolphin home.

I'm more bothered by the complete hands she sometimes grows.</br>  <br>It looks like shit though.</br>    <br>But you can drink it to get big.<br><br>You're big, but you can be bigger.<br><br>I'm gonna get swole.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It really does, though. The animated PV we've seen doesn't look as bad as the initial key visual, but it still is nothing compared to the manga.</br>  <br>What is this, please explain in excruciating detail.</br>  <br>The truth is she's a  Dumpire </br>    <br>AND SEXY POSES!</br>  <br><br><br>It's not JUICY enough in detail. It needs more OOMPH.</br></br></br>  <br>How about you just start reading. Here's a good introduction chapter:http://kissmanga.com/Manga/<wbr>Jitsu-wa-Watashi-wa/Vol-004-Ch-028-<wbr>-Let-s-Go-Grab--Em-Limited-Editions<wbr>-?id=204308</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br> hair down <br>I need more of this in my life</br></br>  <br>Why, and yet again, why not</br>  <br><br>Miia's tail length vary scene by scene<br><br>calling it</br></br></br></br>  <br>How many images do I have to post before you start reading?</br>  <br>WHY'D YOU TELL HIM THE SOURCE!? IT WAS FUN TO TEASE!</br>  <br>Shit. I thought he knew and wanted reasons to read it.</br>  <br>Mah nigga</br>  <br>But l know now, it was all part of my master plan.<br>I bet nobody remembers this was a monster tiddies discussion. Papi best grill. That is all.</br></br>  This thread is suffering from a serious lack of best girl.  <br>I've seen so much Cerea that I forget that she always has it in a ponytail<br><br>Girls with really long, straight hair are my favorite.</br></br></br>  <br>She has two pony tails.</br>  <br>You have goo taste anon. <br><br>Oh shit. You are right.</br></br></br>  <br> goo taste </br>      <br> goo taste </br>  OGRE<br>TITTIES</br>  <br><br>Fuck *Good</br></br>  <br>I THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE</br>  <br>It was a mistake joke. Like " Muh Duck=Muh Dick" I fucked up.</br>    <br>Freudian slips speak the truth. Embrace best girl.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Can't wait to see if they picked the same color choices that I made when I colored this back in 2012:</br></br></br></br>  <br> Monmusu shaming <br>Yes, perfect.</br></br>  <br> monster tiddies. <br> Papi <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br>Suu's been officially colored for a long time.</br>  <br>Fried my brain</br>  BTW, for those waiting patiently for more Jitsu... we're going to have a bonus for you all in honor of the anime starting. Look forward to it Tuesday.  <br>Probably, who cares though, it does in the manga as well<br><br>Pic related, her tail length isn't even remotely the same</br></br></br>  <br><br>When I colored Suu, I just did traditional slime colors. No one knew her hair color at the time, so I guessed that wrong.<br><br>I colored vase blue because I thought she'd pay attention to something the same color she was. I made the cup pink because I saw one in an office depot catalog. I also chose red for the bug spray (Thanks google translate) and the alarm clock (also color referenced from the same Office Depot catalog).<br><br>Imagine my surprise when Suu was holding a BLUE vase in the preview. If she has a RED alarm clock in the show, I will lose my shit...<br><br>That or the crabman/animators like fan art?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   in a perfect world <br> there's gonna be an ending for every girl <br> even the shit ones like lala <br> and everyone will be happy </br></br></br>  <br> Lala <br> Shit <br>Pick one<br> perfect world <br> ending for every girl <br>Pick one<br> Everyone <br> Happy <br>Pick one</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Everyone <br> &gt;Happy <br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>jej</br>  <br>mem</br>  <br> Lala <br> Shit <br> Pick one <br><br> No </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>vev</br>  <br>LOOK AT THAT SNOUT</br>  <br>geg</br>  <br>xex</br>    <br>cec</br>  <br><br>This.<br><br>Not sure how ANY Monmusu-race can compare with Lamias for top-tier cuddling.</br></br></br></br>  Is Polt the strongest Pokemon?  <br><br>It only struck me just now how huggable Mero looks with those big droopy ears and large, round eyes.</br></br>  <br>You ever heard of the Venus fly trap? Draws in unsuspecting flies into its maw with the scent of sweets, then kills them?<br>That's what's happening right now to you</br></br>  <br> You ever heard of the Venus fly trap? Draws in unsuspecting flies into its maw with the scent of sweets, then kills them? <br><br>B-But I'm not a fish, she wouldn't want to eat me.</br></br></br>  <br> polt used tail whip </br>  <br><br> Mero can be scary when she wants to. </br></br>  <br>She slapped Papi? Get fucked Papi.</br>  <br><br><br>Pokemonmusu, gotta catch em all!</br></br></br>  <br><br>Mero's fishy-ears are awesome.<br><br>They're second only to Miia's snakey elf-ears. Centaurea's horsey-ears are OK too, but not quite as exotic.<br><br>I wonder if they serve some purpose like allowing her to hear speech underwater when other Mermaids talk.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Papi threatened to harm the couch that makes people turn to mush, and Mero instinctively defended the thing she loves.<br><br> Imagine Mero actually getting worked up. </br></br></br></br>  Anime improved all of them.  <br><br>Back when the Monster Girl Encyclopedia was new, it was compared to Pokemon relatively frequently simply due to everyone wanting to seriously catch them all.</br></br>  <br>She's not that kind of pervert. She just wants to poison you so she can roe to the depth of love she shows by taking care of you though it's hopeless.</br>  <br><br>EAR RANKING:<br><br>Ninetei &gt; Miia = Mero &gt; Cerea &gt; Polt &gt; Everyone else</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not about the eating, it's the death that is assured<br>It has already begun. You have been drawn in by Mero's charms. Look at you. Already falling for her cute droopy ears and large round eyes, urging you to give her a warm embrace<br>But the: what's this? Suddenly you feel cold! A wetness in your side, followed with an excruciating pain! Oh, what is happening? Your vision is going dark, and next thing you know it Lala's leading you somewhere</br></br></br>  <br> what's this? Suddenly you feel cold! A wetness in your side, followed with an excruciating pain! <br><br> Mero <br> Stabbing you <br><br>Nigga the thing with Mermaids is they drag you into the water.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> and Mero instinctively defended the thing she loves. <br><br> I like to think that she'll do the same next time she's around when Darling is in danger. </br></br></br></br>  <br> Tio <br> Purple horn <br>Wat<br><br>Otherwise good, though</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Zombina not having her sickly-looking dark-green hair <br> improvement <br><br>No.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sometimes you've got to improvise when there's no water around<br>I mean, if all murders were near water, then people would avoid large bodies of water. You have to mix it up</br></br>  The questions in the game the last few days have been pretty ambiguous.<br><br>I know its "Japanese herbivore simulator 2015", but goddamn.</br></br>  <br>Please get your eyes checked. You're not the same person who thought the anime threw out Zombina's heterochromia, are you?</br>  Since MMniN basically prints merchandising money, does that mean an S2 is guaranteed eventually?  <br>All depends on how the anime sells</br>  <br>Zombina looks ginger. Perfectly reasonable considering that she has no soul, being a zombie and all.</br>  <br>Red is for hotblooded oni, she's blue until she develops a problem with authority or a calmer oni joins her hierarchy.</br>  <br><br> Blue <br> Purple <br>Am I in a colour-blind thread?</br></br></br></br>  Hey guys, I hate to muddle the thread with self-advertisement, but I wanted to go ahead and let you know that  I'm the graphic-designer guy that's been constantly promising to get my shirt-designs uploaded somewhere for purchase, and I've FINALLY started uploading my shirt-designs for purchase. <br><br>I finally decided to stop being an indecisive faggot and start uploading my designs to RedBubble.<br>If I end up finding a better site, I'll move them eventually, but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.<br><br>I went ahead and got my first design, the Rachnera Emblem, uploaded and available for purchase on a t-shirt (or a number of other things, actually).<br><br>http://www.redbubble.com/people/log<wbr>anagle/works/15378617-rachnera-skul<wbr>l?grid_pos=1&amp;p=t-shirt<br><br>I'll get the English version of the Suu Warning Sign corrected and uploaded tomorrow, as well as my other designs that I've been polishing.<br><br> I also understand that linking personal information anywhere on 4chan is a gamble, but Hell, I don't even have my own website yet, so there's not much to doxx if someone decided to be an asshole and do so, so whatever, I'll take my chances and say that anybody who cares enough to look at my page is a nice enough guy to not bother with stuff like that. <br><br>And once again, just a reminder:<br>I'm still taking requests for ideas for graphics and t-shirt designs. If you have one, suggest it, and I may be able to make it for you free of charge.<br><br>Here's hoping this jump-starts my little graphic-design career.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>STOP GIVING HER IDEAS</br></br>  <br><br> Since MMniN basically prints merchandising money <br><br>Have we had confirmation of this in any tangible sense?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I still want my hats. But if you really wanted to go full scale on the designs and shit we could make a "community" googledrive/pastebin with various MonMonsume threads' OC</br>  <br>based</br>  <br><br>This list should include Merino, Tonn and Cott.<br>Sheepy-ears aren't THAT cool, but they're still pretty nice and fun to pinch.</br></br></br>  <br>I guess I'm doing pretty good then</br>  <br><br><br>Ears should be ranked according to how expressive they are and how cute they look on the character.<br><br>Ninetei undoubtedly wins in both cases since almost every panel involves her expressing emotion with them, and they're cute adorable fox ears, while the others generally have floppy barely-expressive ears that look varying degrees of cute on them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>MM doesn't have a SINGLE Figma!<br>you know a series is financially popular if it has FIGMAS</br></br>  <br><br> She just wants to poison you so she can roe to the depth of love she shows <br><br> roe <br><br>Did you mean "row"?<br><br>If so, this was a Freudian Slip.<br><br>Guess what the word "roe" connotates:<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm just saying. When the police come in after hearing a stuggle or someone calls them and they find a dead body surrounded by or drenched in water, obviously all eyes are going to go to Mero<br>But, say you "trip" and fall down the stairs, breaking every bone in your body. Who could have done that? I mean, you could brush that off as an accident, or maybe Papi or Cerea's massive horse butt bumped into him<br>Or, what if they find the body in the kitchen with an obvious wound created by a sharp pbject. Rachne could be blamed. Miia's been trying her hand at cooking and probably miss-held a utensil.<br>And while we're on the topic of food, what about poisoning? Miia's food looks like something straight out of The Thing--maybe that killed him<br><br>Murder is all about planning ahead. It's not something you do on a whim. You must plan it out, the intricate details down to the wire. Unless you want to get caught, you must find a way to hide evidence or pile them onto someone else<br>Oh god, wait a tick. I think I got too into this. I sound like a psychopath. I knew watching murder mystery films was a bad idea</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey there, I'm the guy who gave you the idea for the suu design.<br><br>If you still feel like shooting me a shirt once you get it uploaded, I'd be appreciative.<br><br> gairwise@gmail.com </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just want to say that your stuff is pretty cool, but be on the watch out for C&amp;Ds probably from whoever picks up the anime, especially if it's FUNimation. Seven Seas doesn't gave a shit, since they haven't bothered with scanlators, but the anime companies are way harsher about this stuff.</br>  <br><br>Yes</br></br>  <br><br>I will do my best, but I'm broke as fuck.<br><br>I do get a 5$ discount for ordering my own shirt, but even that isn't super great.<br><br>Believe me, if I weren't a clinically broke loser still looking for full-time employment, I'd send you one pro-bono without a second thought. But as it stands, I'll have to wait and see what my finances allow.<br><br>Once I'm a globe-trotting CEO with a tennis-court on his yacht, I'll send you a bunch of free shirts. How about that?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If she's a zombie how come she still has fair skin and is able to blush? Logic says she shouldn't have blood pumping through her body for that to happen, she has a heart but it's not beating, through I did find it strange that her right breast fell off with no blood splatter at all, yet she was shot full of holes in her debut chapter and there was blood everywhere.</br>  <br> FUNimation <br>Don't even mention it. I can only imagine the hell that will happen if funi picks it up and the anime watchers will be split between people with sense and the faggots who stream or use HorribleSubs and actually don't have the sense to realize that funi is unwatchable shit.</br></br>   Yurika Kubo as Tionishia <br><br>Japan can't cast for shit, can they?</br></br>  <br><br>This is true, but most of my designs are so simplified, ambiguous or abstract that it's hard to even prove where they came from.<br><br>So long as I'm not appropriating copyrighted concept-art or the like (all of my images are hand-made originals, just arguably "inspired" by things in the media), I should theoretically be fine unless they just have a massive all-consuming hard-on for C&amp;D's.<br><br> But barring that, maybe you're right. In that case BUY MY SHIRTS NOW BUY MY SHIRTS NOW BUY MY SHIRTS NOW, WHILE THEYR'E STILL THERE, HURRY BEFORE THEY DISAPPEAR, TIME FOR IMPULSE-PURCHASES. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Get a job, you hippie. <br><br>I have a grade 8 education and make 15 burger coupons an hour. There's literally something for everyone out there.</br></br></br>  <br> telling someone to get a job <br> on NEET central /a/ </br></br>  <br><br>Oh, I have a job. It's just that most of it goes towards rent until I can find a better one.</br></br>    <br><br>I expected MON uniforms to be not so bright and obvious. Something more similar to actual SWAT or specialized police-forces.<br><br>Not bright banana-split yellow.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't even bother. Looks like it will be censored in the A-TX version as well.</br>  <br>Wow this actually looks good. Can't wait for it.</br>  <br>I want to do naughty things to that horn.</br>  <br>It's true, rent is a right cunt.<br><br>Kids are even more expensive though, I don't recommend having those unless you hate money.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Kids are even more expensive though, I don't recommend having those unless you hate money. <br><br>Not even close to that stage in my life yet.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Would you Tio's horn? </br></br>  <br><br> that ear-fluff <br><br>Every time I see it, it makes me want to poke it and watch her ears wiggle in reflex.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  yes  </br>  The hardest question:<br> would monmusu ever have become popular without the titties and nip slips? </br>  <br><br>If you ask me, yes.<br><br>You can get titties and nip-slips in any other ecchi manga out there.<br><br>You can't, however, get adorable Lamias that love to snuggle in bed with you and give you full-body hugs.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doppel is growing on me<br> maybe I just like things that can change form like best girl here </br></br>  I want a chapter that explores what doppel is.  <br>Sexy?<br>Already enough sexy throughout the manga.</br></br>  <br>yeah but i want to know if shes a friendly elritch horror or faking it.</br>  <br>Probably. Could just be the Japanese players not in the top three decided to quit. I'm Rank 115 for Cerea players, I think.</br>  <br><br>I'm hoping Okayado does more cuteness that's been inspired by H.P. Lovecraft.<br><br>Mythology is one of those things that works great when you pull from a diverse range of sources.</br></br></br></br>   <br>i just wanna know if she is friendly.</br>  With the pattern I'm currently at in the MonMusu game, I should achieve 15000 points in 298 days.  <br> I want to let my Q-bert hop on those cubes.<br><br>Yaya, 3DPD, but kawaii geek girl.</br></br> <br><br>Also, Tio is very much a little girl in a giant body, so cutesy voice is not out of place for her.</br></br></br>  <br>Same way here. Ghost girls, too.</br>  <br>I hate everything about that song.   But I dawwwwed very hard just now 11/10 </br>  <br>Mah nigga. Heterochromia is based</br>  <br>What song is she singing?</br>  Whats moonrune for "how tall is kurusu?"   Reminder   Rachnee, Mero, and Smith commercials never  <br>I drew a picture of this.<br>I'll post it tomorrow since I use paper and pencil don't have a scanner at home.</br></br>  <br>Did she apply shine to her stockings?</br>  <br>She wears leather stockings</br>  Twitter Icons Incoming            <br>Nylon is shiny.</br>  <br>オカヤド先生、どのように背の高い来留主はありますか？</br>  <br>He's probably like 5'7"</br>   tfw you can't stop listening to the chorus of the OP <br><br>TV SIZE WHEN.</br></br>  <br> Tfw we'll have to wait so long to see best girl </br>  <br>At least she's there</br>  SBR = prequel to "What a Wonderful World?" Make your case.<br><br>Also how do you think the Battle with Kars went down in SBR universe?<br><br> http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87 </br></br></br></br>  <br>I somehow get it, but what about Giorno and GER? Did they get affected too?</br>  <br> Epitaph would have to be passive and continuous to be truly unbeatable, right? But from what I recall he has to activate that too. <br><br>Yeah, it's not passive. He can also use KC epitaphless to avoid bullets, for example, like he does with Metallica's user.

It can get much worse than that.</br>   DBZ thread <br>You plebs probably watched that shit before the original<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=WyW<wbr>1ennTqlc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> Watching the anime <br><br>The only pleb here is you and also literally everyone else on /a/.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah</br>  <br>Dragon Ball's anime adaptation is pretty great. It really doesn't suffer from any QUALITY and has some really nice art.</br>  <br>You clearly haven't watched it recently. The middle third of every episode is pointless filler and animation is repeated constantly.</br>  <br>Well for one, making buu was sealed so there was no worry there, and beerus was too powerful to catch up to, so being third most powerful and while one was sleeping and didn't care what frieza did and the other was sealed, there was no one to stand against you. So what was the point.</br>  <br>Well I think the reason you harken back to the adventure was because of frieza returning. During the namek saga, it was an adventure, you had gohan and krillian running from Frieza's henchmen while still collecting dragonballs and vegeta killing off henchmen while still looking for dragonballs. Pretty much that was the only time you see Vegeta actually have an adventure even though he jumped from boss to boss.</br>  <br>Frieza went through all of the trouble inventing his lower forms because he couldn't control his full power for long periods of time. If he could have so easily mastered his full power by training then why did he need to create his three suppressed forms?</br>  <br> All the barafags that are going to latch onto him </br>  why is cap autistic?  Wasn't the entire movie just a cash grab after Toei saw how much nostalgia money could still be milked out of the series after Xenoverse?  <br>Unless the whole movie was scripted, written, voice acted and animated in two months, no.</br>  <br>My bad, written, voice acted and animated.</br>  <br><br>What isnt a cashgrab these days? Do you think people make new movies, tv series, toys, etc. out of the goodness of their hearts?</br></br>    <br>But HE'S FAT</br>  <br>I'm watching it right now. There has been some filler, but not a huge amount and the repeated animation is there, but used in ways that aren't really an issue. And there are enough moments of really nice animation to make up for it. Really, for a 100+ anime, Dragon Ball is very impressive.</br>  <br>Which makes him soft.</br>  <br>He wasn't a God, his ssj was imbued wit some God power. Like hurculese imbued with God like strength. Goku is not super man. He had frieza on his hands an knees and open for a sneak attack. We really need to remember that this isn't what we think it is. Power levels are actually useless, (don't give me that frieza 10000000000000000000 number, in the end means nothing since a laser beam can kill goku.) transformations maybe flashy but it's possible to never need it and get stronger. Also God in Japanese terms and in pretty muc Asian terms doesn't mean invulnerable. Gods can be killed but means to be a God is to be reborn with your memories and power. Also to be imbued with the power of emotion of faith or fear. <br>So tldr;<br>Gods aren't the same in Greek gods in Asian culture.</br></br></br>  http://sp.sportslist.com  <br>Ssj3 should have brought the tail back. Longer hair but not as long as the original, would really bring back the whole reason why sayains were so feared.</br>  <br>what is a duwang?</br>  <br>Goku some what de powered, annoying pan is there just to be rescued, trying to bring back adventure and almost did it, they should have explained how there are stronger beings than buu out there now. Could have been done better, baby was too long and drawn out, shadow dragons was alright tried to use technique to trump power which I like, but still dissapointing, super 17 it was ok.</br>  <br>Creating lesser forms was easier than training, he was a mutant, transforming came natural to him</br>  where the hell can i watch this shit, it has been months already for fucks sake  <br>This image triggers my autism every time. pls stop.<br><br>Vegeta should have finished freeza. So far my only complaint.</br></br></br>  <br>What do we know about his species other than being illegitimate rulers of the galaxy? <br><br>All his ancestors look different.</br></br></br>  <br>Not much about his species but he is part of some alien clan. I think toriyama just puts all the aliens in as one group. Frieza is a mutant of these aliens and even with in his clan along with cold.</br>  <br>I also want to point out why the fuck don't these questions ever come up when interviewing AT. They always talk about shit that no one gives two fucks about, like when we found out ssj2 and 3 were jus power ups that only slipped out on a different question. Like how do sayains reproduce? What is Frieza's race? Why are all these aliens different from frieza yet you say frieza is from a clan. Why don't these interviews elaborate more!?</br>  <br>  7月放送開始の新シリーズ「ドラゴンボール超」はTVアニメ初の鳥山明オリ<wbr>ジナル原案！長い眠りから目覚めた破壊の神ビルスとの出会いや、かつて「宇<wbr>宙の帝王」と恐れられたフリーザの復活に加え、更なる謎の人物も登場…？(<wbr>S)</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br> — 「ドラゴンボール超」公式 (@DB_super2015) May 23, 2015 <br><br> The new TV series “Dragon Ball Super” by Akira Toriyama begins in July!

They get their ass kicked for 30 minutes and then the good guys get some bullshit power-up and turn the tide for the next 20 minutes.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait that horned dude was zarbon level? Since when did piccolo get so depowered?</br>  <br>where did you get that from</br>  <br>This turned out to be incorrect, since it shows beerus before BoG and every one before the God shit</br>  Will we ever see a non-japanese team?  <br>There should be a possibility for that.

Only reason the Firefly has such a reputation was because it was in Normandy first.

Its "normal" APCBC ammo's accuraccy was perfectly fine. And even more, the greatly overstated "big accuraccy problem" of APDS meant only the guners had to just target center of mass instead of being able to aim for weak spots - not that they needed better with APDS, mind you.<br><br>Also, that "normal" ammo was the one whose power was comparable with a 76mm's scarce HVAP ammo. Both were the ones who had trouble with the Panther. However, the APDS ammo was perfectly able to deal with it.<br><br>Standard 76mm ammo was NOT able to deal with a Tiger, too (it was able to defeat only about 90mm at 500m - some sources ay 93, but that's still not enough). And HVAP ammo was not always available, as you should know.<br><br>So, if you want me to consider you as a serious scholar of the Sherman variants, instead of asuming you're just a so-called "shermanfag", please stop atributing the best characteristics of both kinds of M1 ammo AND the worst characteristics of both 17-pounder ammos AT THE SAME TIME.

Keep in mind similar studies have been done ABROAD across countries where gay marriage/adoption is legal and they found the same thing, there are no significant differences between the two.</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br> no one is going to pay a body pillow alimony. <br>I will pay her alimony because I love her.</br></br>  <br> implying lunatics haven't existed in every population since the dawn of man </br>  <br> So gays can now get married, but marriage between 3D and 2D is still banned. <br>Go to japan, it's completely legal there</br></br>  <br>It's funny because you think none of those studies are politically motivated. Find me a study that was published outside the Zionist sphere of influence, for example in China or Iran, that supports what you have claimed.</br>  <br>How the fuck NBR for ONE route?</br>  <br>But gay marriage isn't legal in Japan, so no gay marriage to 2D waifus.</br>  <br>the other anon will simply claim anything done by them is biased and wrong because they already agree with the west and their ideals. The West believes if you don't do it their way you're wrong, probably evil, know your wrong and are simply suppressing the innocent masses and/or brainwashing them.</br>  <br> NBR <br><br>b8</br></br></br>  Bully the Neko  <br>*already disagree</br>  <br>Yes, I realize that I'm arguing with a brainwashed, indoctrinated cultural marxist. That doesn't mean that I shouldn't even try, does it?</br>  <br>Kirino is such a bitch. I can't help but love her though... despite the fact that she is, without a doubt, a raging bitch.</br>  <br> Thinking China and Iran don't have "biases" too <br>What</br></br>  <br><br>The facts don't agree with my feels, so they must be Liberal Zionist Cultural Marxist propaganda.</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't go as far as Iran because they would definitely have the opposite bias, but China seems like an ideal country to carry out such tests since as far as I know they have no political motivation against or for it</br>  <br>no, but it's like playing Tennis with the wall, they simply won't change their tune.</br>  <br>She isn't.</br>  <br>All countries that have already had gay marriage are fine and straight people haven't really been affected or even care about it much.<br>However, when the US does it, everyone loses their collective shit and acts they're the first ones to do it or something.</br></br>  <br>I was going to say something... but I can't think of anything to say, so:<br>OK.</br></br>  <br> China seems like an ideal country to carry out such tests since as far as I know they have no political motivation against or for it <br>Nope. They're heavily anti-gay and censor it.</br></br>  <br> The facts don't agree with my feels, so they must be Conservative fascist bigoted propaganda! </br>  <br>China basically stops and criminalizes all things that could potentially be fun.</br>  <br>Who cares about gringoland. We're all japanese/otakunese here. <br><br/></br></br>  <br>Oho! The ol' switcharoo...</br>  <br><br>It'd be a test for their love, if it's not genuine enough, then it was never worth it.<br><br>Even in NJ.<br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Truth hurts</br>  <br>then why do you like our language so much and keep using it at inappropriate times to sound 'cool'?</br>  <br>And that's why I'll never get people who think that legalizing gay marriage is sliding backwards, like holy fuck can't you see the ones that hate gays are always complete shitholes. That's no coincidence.</br>  <br>If you advocate homosexuality, you support eugenics.</br>  My only concern is how long will it take for loli to be legalized?  <br>Invent time travel and go back to medieval ages</br>  <br>It's on the list after transvestites, incest, and bestiality, at least.</br>  <br>Except he's right.</br>  <br>I think you mean the 1920's</br>  <br> transvestites <br>Disgusting, but I can see it<br><br> incest <br>Doubtful but not impossible<br><br> bestiality <br>Literally what? How?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>kek<br><br>An impasse has been reached</br></br></br>  <br>Polygamy is almost certainly going to be legal in our lifetime.</br>  <br>Japan hates gays.

Statistically more actually, since they're a bigger group.</br>  <br><br> implying that anal sex is the only way for gays to have sex <br><br>Besides, that's not a gay issue. Straight people have anal sex too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shouldn't you be in school faggot?</br>  <br>Probably not as much as you think considering there definitely used to be homosexual samurai, but even then they'll still be dying off anyway.

It really is. Don't be fooled by liberal hypocrisy</br>  <br>Japan also likes Saber. What's your point?</br>  <br>That Japan doesn't "hate" gays as much as people here think?</br>   this thread <br>http://pastebin.com/jHN1iL84</br>  Racemixing is a much bigger sin than incest.<br>If it came between choosing a nigger and your sibling, who would you choose?</br>  <br> The marriage lasted <br>Where I have to go to find this happiness?</br></br>  <br>It can never happen.<br>Even if a kid that age fell in love with you society would brainwash him into thinking you're manipulating him and the kid will eventually come to hate and resent you.</br></br>  <br>Should have said "age difference". Sorry bro.</br>  <br>Japan is so deep in the closet it'll reach Narnia. Niconico has two huge memes about gay porn and they have a fucking penis festival for god's sake.</br>  <br>It's mostly the older generations that are very uncomfortable with the idea, which is a large percent of the populations.</br>  <br>Muh dick<br>Dammit why don't I have a cute sister close to my age?  I'm just now realizing I have this fetish </br></br>  <br>She's pretty. Lucky guy.</br>  <br>I used to say "/pol/ please go" but we need you now more than ever.</br>  <br>Don't worry, anon. No one will have kids with you so you'll be fine.</br>  <br>But anon, that is the point. Saber is a bisexual tranny.</br>  <br>It just warms my heart to know that /a/ has actually successfully brought two siblings together  instead of ruining their relationship like what normally happens .<br><br> I hope to God that wasn't fiction. </br></br></br>  <br><br> Person is pro-abortion <br> Person is pro-gay marriage <br>Person cannot logically oppose incestuous marriage without breaking their own beliefs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How? It's inmoral</br>  <br>How does pro-abortion conflict with anti-incest?</br>  <br>Not that anon, but one of the common anti-incest talking points is that their children will have genetic deformities. If abortion is okay, then that's no longer as much of a problem as it would be.</br>  <br>If they the wife accidentally got pregnant, they could abort it instead of having a "mutant baby".</br>  <br><br> you can actually get your girlfriend to call you onii-chan <br><br>I'm dying</br></br></br></br>  I tip my hat to the series for at least playing the incest straight, but the anime was still gutter haremshit of the worst kind. I mean the supposed best girl is one of the shittiest girls to gain popularity in recent memory.  <br>Make sure to lock the door every time you take a shit, or else.</br>  <br>To the past</br>  So ITT: Progressive anime ideas?<br><br>We already have Jewcob selling loli porn in the US. Why not just outright legalize them so I can read them anywhere?</br></br>  <br> http://pastebin.com/jHN1iL84 <br>Ah redline imouto. That trip appeared a couple weeks ago and left a cryptic single post.</br></br>  <br>That's a pedo, not a lolicon.<br><br>I don't think they existed in the 1920's.</br></br></br>  <br>there are possible health issues with both, but incest is usually a better and safer option.</br>  Older women shouldn't have kids as well as drug addicts, but they are allowed. They have a higher % of having their children be born with some type of disability too.  <br>You are supposed to read "pro-abortion" and "pro-gay marriage" as simply "pro-degeneracy." Incest is just another form of degeneracy, so if you support those other things (and let's face it, you probably smoke weed too), then you don't have your own beliefs in order if you don't also support incest, pedophilia, bestiality, transgenderism, welfare, sexual promiscuity, scat porn, and other forms of degeneracy.</br>  <br><br> using degeneracy unironically </br></br>   I fucking love this show.   <br>What if I hate gays and like incest and lolis?</br>  <br>I'm in the same camp as </br>  <br><br> abortion is degeneracy <br>The whole point of abortion is so that you don't bring any more fucked up, degenerate children into the world.</br></br></br>  <br>*unsheathe katana*<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RYj<wbr>t1-TEQk4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> murdering the peasant class at birth instead of giving them an equal chance at life <br>Yeah, OK. Totally not degeneracy m8.</br></br>  <br>They don't have an equal chance at life. Chances are they'll end up an alcoholic working as a second-rate mechanic in some shitty garage just so that they can support their fucked up, selfish brats that they've spawned to replace themseves.<br><br>Totally not degeneracy, I know.</br></br></br>  <br>You only believe that because you've been indoctrinated to believe it.</br>  <br> Abortion is the utter rejection of life. I can understand if you cannot support the child financially or don't want to bear the responsibility of it but I feel a wrongness in it to my very being similar to suicide. </br>  <br>Fucking shit taste.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6zF<wbr>OzpTe9o8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Indoctrinated by who? I've met literally no one who shares my opinion on this matter.</br>  <br>Nice anime discussion</br>  <br>I remember that manga about a girl who aborted her rape baby. It made me feel like an emo for weeks.<br><br>Last time that happened was when I saw 5cm per second.</br></br></br>  <br>I understand your sentiment, but when you think about it, if a couple wants an abortion, then they don't want their baby. Would that unwanted baby have any chance at a happy childhood?<br><br>No one, save for the most radical of SJWs, is really pro-abortion. No one likes abortion. They're just anti-anti-abortion.</br></br></br>  <br><br> hurt no one <br><br>Funny you bring up hurting no one while being against gays. Let them suck dick, not anyone's problem.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why not just put it up for adoption? Better yet have the gov't stop spending for the homeless and the autistic and just use it to fund a chain of orphanage/schools where they can be brought up as good citizens and not degenerates like those progressives.</br>  <br> I've met literally no one who is pro-abortion <br>You're an idiot. It doesn't matter if you have "met" them. The liberal media, Hollywood, your schooling, even such obscure sources as science fiction authors have influenced your thought process, whether you know it or not. Your thoughts are not yours. You were led to believe this from your environment, which has been highly suggestive to the conclusion that degeneracy is good.</br></br>  <br>Imouto threads always turn into shitty blog threads for obvious reasons. This one though is shit for entirely different reasons.</br>  <br>Abu Ali is fucking based.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=A-z<wbr>1ia3uKsY</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Q3P<wbr>CeyiAH30</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  I can't believe so many people support gay mariage but think incest should be illegal. Everytime I talk about incest mariage to a friend it goes like this :<br> Tell friends I'm not against incest mariage. <br> "But it's creepy and it's dangerous for their kid." <br> "They can just use condom and adopt a child like gay people." <br> "But it's not moral !" <br>Fucking hypocrite, they don't want incest to be legal because THEY think it's creepy so nobody else should be able to do this. People used to think the same thing about gay people one century ago.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just the usual bullshit genetics, politics and degeneracy discussion.</br>  <br>Orphanages generally aren't nice places to live in and just throwing money at issues don't solve them. There will be kids who will have a ton of issues that definitely can't just be solved with money and ultimately will just have a more difficult life, which has a negative effect on society (or positive if we're lucky, but as the saying goes prepare for the worse.)<br><br>Not to mention pregnancy is a very dramatic experience someone/a family shouldn't be forced through if there are other options.<br><br>And you literally can't just give up on existing people for the sake of "possible" people. That's just fucked up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lesbian mothers adopt children.<br>To adopt children you need quite some qualifications, and you won't going to adopt them without a plan.<br>Straight mothers can just get knocked up and not do an abort despite living in a trailer.</br></br></br>  <br>Can't that be said about your perspective too? Universal truth and right are pretty rare if not nonexistant in our world.</br>  <br>I thought you meant the other part. The part about people shouldn't have children because they're going to have shitty lives.<br>This is where the pro-abortion comes from. And while I say pro-abortion what I really mean is anti-children. As in, every child should be euthanized.<br><br>Digressing here.<br> Your thoughts are not yours. You were led to believe this from your environment <br>Literally every thought either comes from the environment or is an extrapolation of those thoughts. It's literally impossible to have an entirely original thought that comes from nowhere.<br><br> which has been highly suggestive to the conclusion that degeneracy is good. <br>It's more like, degeneracy is unavoidable so you should just kill everyone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait another century then.</br>  <br>People just support gay marriage because it's a mainstream idea now, and it seems like all their facebook friends are in favor of it. They aren't supporting it because they've given it any thought.</br>  <br>I'll be honest with you, I have no idea why not. It seems so few people consider giving the baby up for adoption. I suppose it's for the same reason everyone here who's against incest because of the inbreeding factor never thinks the couple couldn't simply adopt. It's like no one ever considers adoption.</br>  <br>If you look at the broader societal consequences of mass abortion, the picture is very grim. White people are not having as many babies as we need to have to support our economy. That is why immigration is so loose in every Western nation. What whites can not (do not) produce in offspring, dark people are brought in by the boat-ful, with their diseases, primitive cultures and backwards lifestyles, and they are being allowed to live in our countries, fundamentally changing our demographics and essentially taking our country away from the people who made it what it is. Once they reach a sufficient number, they can elect their own dark people into office (one already sits in the seat of the POTUS) and celebrate the death of the white race.</br>  <br> We should just kill everyone <br><br>Seems like your missing the point anon, unless your point was that the argument you're presenting is ridiculous. The conversation flow is throwing me off.</br></br></br>  <br>You honestly think rednecks down south are gonna give that much thought before fucking like rabbits? Legalizing incest is unrealistic before genetic engineering becomes more advanced.</br>  <br>So what? That's just evolution and humanity will continue to change just like it has for thousands of years. This isn't effecting your life right now in any significant way.</br>  <br>The whole concept of morals being relative and cultural relativity is yet another aspect of your indoctrination. OF COURSE there is empirical right and wrong. Not accepting this is what has ruined our culture this much and allowed us to nominate fags as a protected class of people in the first place.</br>  <br>Human genetic engineering is taboo for good reason.</br>  <br> And you literally can't just give up on existing people for the sake of "possible" people. <br><br>Yeah, right. Half a century ago people are fighting for the freedom of "possible people". If I tell them what you just said they'd think I'm crazy.<br><br>Also what problems? If they can be brought up to understand their situation any problem can be resolve. Get competent and zealous workers who loves kids(I'd probably help more if they have parent complexes).<br><br>Birth is dramatic, yes. But so is sex. IMO if they really don't want to get pregnant, use protection or don't have sex at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> OF COURSE there is empirical right and wrong. <br><br>Prove it. <br> Pro-tip people (that I'm sure are much smarter than you) have been trying for century and have only talked in circles. If you somehow succeed there's probably a lot of money waiting for you. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Hello JIDF. It's funny. You kikes get your own racially pure (in theory and in political policy) homeland, but when us whites ask for a homeland of our own, you just respond with "so what?" Very telling.</br>  <br>I think I am missing the point, what's the point?<br><br>As for my point. There is no point.</br></br></br>  <br>  So you're attacking LGBT with incest <br>  you're a genius <br>  Daily reminder adam and eve were the only humans created by God <br>  We're all the products of incestuous degenerates <br>  Were 3 Billion people more than enough <br>  Gays are doing us a favor getting rid of excess humans <br>Also anon if there more males gays then women it means the ratio for you getting laid increases<br>  Support gay marriage you faggot </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>FLAWLESS LOGIC</br>  <br>But there aren't more male gays than female.<br><br>Lesbians outnumber gay guys by like ten to one.</br></br></br>  <br> "you've just been indoctrinated to believe that." <br> "the same could be said about you." <br> "you've been indoctrinated to believe that, but what I say is empirically and morally correct." <br>backtrack backtrack</br></br></br></br>  <br> Nope. They're heavily anti-gay and censor it. <br>Literally why?<br>India and China should enforce homosexuality, they've got a billion and a billion and a half citizens respectively, do something about it guys.</br></br></br>  <br> Also anon if there more males gays then women <br>I'm pretty sure it's the opposite. At least there's more bisexual female than male.</br></br>  <br> niggers are like weeds and cockroaches <br>Yep, that about sums it up.</br></br>  <br>Dispute it.</br>  <br>Morality has been experimented with and refined for tens of thousands of years to get to the point where we are now. <br><br>For example, do you think it's coincidence that men are traditionally the primary laborers and women are traditionally the primary care-givers of children? No, of course not. This is a result of our immutable biology. <br><br>Men tend to be stronger than women. Even the fastest Olympic female athletes can easily be bested by the average high school male athlete. <br><br>Additionally, when women get pregnant, they have reduced mobility, reduced strength, and increased irritability. After pregnancy, they find that they have the ability to feed their child with their breast milk, something that men can not do. Breastfeeding, and subsequent child-rearing, further reduces women's ability to do productive labor. <br><br>Really, this is a no-brainer, but modern degenerates (read: "progressives") think that "traditional gender roles," as they call them, should be abolished because they have been indoctrinated to think that. These people are unable to think for themselves, and logic is a foreign concept to them.<br><br>This is an example of objective morality.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where did that anon say he was a Jew?</br>  <br><br> Yeah, right. Half a century ago people are fighting for the freedom of "possible people". If I tell them what you just said they'd think I'm crazy. <br><br>When it comes at the rights of living people, aka the people that the possible people are going to become, you're taking away rights from everyone which is a negative. You can defend the non-living's rights without taking away rights from the living afterall.<br><br> Also what problems? If they can be brought up to understand their situation any problem can be resolve. Get competent and zealous workers who loves kids(I'd probably help more if they have parent complexes). <br><br>There's always going to be a kid who feels he isn't loved enough when a parental figure has to share their love with 30+ kids. That's pretty unavoidable and that's just a first step. <br><br> Birth is dramatic, yes. But so is sex. IMO if they really don't want to get pregnant, use protection or don't have sex at all. <br><br>The thing about sex is that its spontaneous and promotes action before thought just because of the way the brain is set up to promote procreation. Of course people can control themselves, but the nature of sex is going to have people who do so without thinking. You can't just stop that, people have been trying for a long time with little results.<br><br>Pregnancy lasts for months, sex last for a minutes. There's a big difference between the two in regards to the effect it has on a person's (and the peopl surrounding them) life.<br><br>Also a lot of prolife people don't support protection or sex education which is pretty ridiculous.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And Bisexuals women hurt your feelings anon?</br>  <br>Anti-white posters usually are.</br>  <br>Only SJWs actually think traditional gender roles should be abolished. Progressives/degenerates just do what they want and don't give a shit.</br>  <br>I'd argue that being able to live your life properly takes priority over degeneracy, so the point of removing degeneracy by getting rid of all life kind of lacks a point at all, but if you're stating you don't have a point in the first place I guess there isn't anything to discuss.</br>  <br>It is? It seems very subjective to me.</br>  <br>No, in my experience, about 50% of girls under the age of 30 believe that they don't have to learn to cook, clean, or learn to be a good housewife, and a large number of women under 60 find nothing wrong with divorce. Most married households with young couples are comprised of two working adults, and the rising number of women in the workplace, or, much worse, in the military, is proof that the desire to abolish traditional gender roles is mainstream.</br>  <br>But current society works while giving women more empowering roles. That means that alternative perspectives on moralities are effective and as such just as right as what you presented. Ergo, there's isn't an objective truth in this position.</br>  <br>No I think people should be able too sleep with whoever they want tumblrina chan.</br>  <br> "So what? That's just evolution and humanity will continue to change just like it has for thousands of years. This isn't effecting your life right now in any significant way." <br>This is anti-white? It seems to be simply stating facts.</br></br>  <br> all men are physically stronger than all women due to biology that can not be changed, and thus INHERENTLY better suited to doing labor <br> "it all seems very subjective to me" <br><br>Maybe that's because you're mentally retarded.</br></br></br></br>  <br> life <br> good </br></br>  <br>Try saying what you are thinking without using so many buzzwords. I can't decipher any meaning from your post whatsoever, just a bunch of meaningless fluff.</br>  <br>Also just to add, gender roles aren't so much a subject of morality (What is good) so much as what works. Just because something works doesn't mean its good. <br><br>For example, utilitarianism works, but people argue that it isn't moral.</br></br></br>  <br>Were you following the conversation at all?</br>  <br> they don't want incest to be legal because THEY think it's creepy so nobody else should be able to do this. People used to think the same thing about gay people one century ago. <br> normies not just following the flow <br><br>What did you expect? nice things?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gender roles are morality. To provide a counter-example, prostitution, sexual promiscuity, adutery, etc. are considered immoral.</br>  <br>All men aren't stronger than all women, however. Rather, men as a whole temd to be stronger than all women, but there's a significant amount of overlap, and the difference between the strongest man and weakest man is significantly larger than the difference between the strongest man and strongest woman.</br>  <br>What buzzwords am I even using there, I thought my point was pretty simple.<br><br>Point A works by dismissing A.<br>Point B works by accepting A.<br>Therefore an opinion on A is subjective.<br><br>Point A is traditional gender roles, point B is non-traditional, A is following non traditional gender roles.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Life is fine, the world has just become rotten due to evil people to the point people would prefer self termination.</br>  <br>You didn't even read the earlier post, did you?</br>  <br>Aren't those considered immoral for both genders?</br>  <br> empowering roles <br> alternative perspectives on moralities <br> objective truth <br><br>Your post lacks any content as to what you think any of these buzzwords mean, or what they refer to in the real world. Be more specific.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, and what I saw was that, instead of answering their question "so what", you chose to assume they were a Jew and then accuse them of being hypocritical.</br>  <br>Did I imply otherwise?</br>  <br>Uh-huh... So what?</br>  <br>I already did.<br>that.<br>I made my point again in a different way for you since you're too retarded to put two and two together.<br><br>I'll do it one more time on the off chance you might make an insightful response.<br><br> empowering roles <br>Non-traditional roles. ie having a woman not be the care giver.<br> alternative perspectives on moralities <br>Someone having a different opinion on morality.<br>I think non traditional roles are okay<br>I think non traditional roles are not okay<br> objective truth <br>Something that cannot be presented as wrong.<br>This is always good<br>This is always bad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then it isn't a gender role issue since gender issues stick to one gender.</br>  <br>What I'm saying is that your absolute statements aren't objective truths at all, but subjective opinions at best.</br>  <br>And where do you think that you proved any of this?</br>  <br> scat porn <br>Too far, buddy</br></br>  Which nigga here wants to get stomped on in philosophy speaking about "objective truth"? <br> I'm not actually gonna argue, I came to /a/ for JoJo, and cute 2D girls </br>  <br>To better define that, the issues stick to comparing genders which isn't the case in your example.<br><br>You can create morality from comparisons, men should do x, women shouldn't do x. So I can admit defeat there.</br></br></br>  <br>How do you figure?</br>  <br>minus lolis I also like incest and hate gay's antics</br>  <br>Proved what, going to have to be specific</br>  <br>Human DNA is not a result of my opinion.</br>   Tfw such a sucker for the middle schooler imouto route that you put up with kirishit   <br> Gays are doing us a favor getting rid of excess humans <br><br>At least they remove themselves as long as they don't corrupt other young souls.</br></br></br>  <br>Just fuck off.</br>  <br> kirino <br> not a best <br>pick one</br></br></br>  <br>Because the idea of gender roles separate genders into different classifications.</br>  <br>Whether or not they're Jewish has no relevance to the discussion.</br>  <br>Does that mean I win? I genuinely didn't know what you were referring to, I made a lot of points in my post.</br>  <br>You are so naive.</br>  <br>That's what they want to do, not what they believe everyone should do. There's a difference.</br>  <br>On the assumption they're not Jewish, what point do you stand on?</br>  <br>It means you're being too difficult.<br><br> make a vague statement <br> asked for clarification <br> make further vague statements that seem to imply something but prove nothing <br> asked to point to where you proved anything you implied <br> respond with a question <br><br>Just go away.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sorry, anon, but it really doesn't.</br>  <br>They are acting on their concepts of morality, which is twisted in strange, wrong ways.</br>  <br> God  <br><br>Kek.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>They are still anti-white. What does it matter whether they are a yid or just brainwashed by yids? For the purposes of this conversation, they are a Jew.</br>  <br>Being naive is preferable to being delusional.</br>  <br>Buddy, you came to the wrong place.
